				<td>Field of invention<br>
This invention relates to a substituted piperazine compounds which are inhibitors<br>
of serine proteases and to pharmaceutical compositions thereof and. their use in the<br>
treatment of the human or animal body.<br>
Background of invention<br>
The serine proteases are a group of proteolytic enzymes which have a common<br>
catalytic mechanism characterized by a particularly reactive Ser residue. Examples of<br>
serine proteases include trypsin, tryptase, chymotrypsin, elastase, thrombin, plasmin,<br>
kallikrein, Complement Cl, acrosomal protease, lysosomal protease, cocoonase, a-lytic<br>
protease, protease A, protease B, serine carboxypeptidase II, subtilisin, urokinase, Factor<br>
VIla, Factor IXa, and Factor Xa.<br>
The serine proteases have been investigated extensively over a period of several<br>
decades and the therapeutic value of inhibitors of serine proteases is well understood.<br>
Serine protease inhibitors play a central role in the regulation of a wide variety of<br>
physiological process including coagulation, fibrinolysis, fertilization, development,<br>
malignancy, neuromuscular patterning and inflammation. It is well known that these<br>
compounds inhibit a variety of circulating proteases as well as proteases that are activated<br>
or released in tissue. It is also becoming clear that serine protease inhibitors inhibit<br>
critical cellular processes, such as adhesion, migration, free radical production and<br>
apoptosis. In addition, animal experiments indicate that intravenously administered serine<br>
protease inhibitors, variants or cells expressing serine protease inhibitors, provide a<br>
protective effect against tissue damage.<br>
Serine protease inhibitors have also been predicted to have potential beneficial<br>
uses in the treatment of disease in a wide variety of clinical areas such as oncology,<br>
neurology, haematology, pulmonary medicine, immunology, inflammation and infectious<br>
disease.<br>
In particular serine protease inhibitors may be<br>
beneficial in the treatment of thrombotic diseases, asthma,<br>
emphysema, cirrhosis, arthritis, carcinoma, melanoma,<br>
restenosis, atheroma, trauma, shock and reperfusion injury.<br>
Thus for example an inhibitor of Factor Xa has value as a<br>
therapeutic agent as an anticoagulant, e.g. in the treatment<br>
and prevention of thrombotic disorders. The use of a Factor Xa<br>
inhibitor as an anticoagulant is desirable in view of the<br>
selectivity of its effect. Many clinically approved<br>
anticoagulants have been associated with adverse events owing<br>
to the non-specific nature of their effects on the coagulation<br>
cascade.<br>
Also, there are well-known associations of al protease<br>
inhibitor deficiency with emphysema and cirrhosis and Cl<br>
esterase inhibitor deficiency with angioedema.<br>
It has now been found that certain aromatic compounds<br>
carrying bulky lipophilic side chains are particularly<br>
effective as inhibitors of serine proteases, especially<br>
proteases with negatively charged P1 specificity pockets, and<br>
most especially the serine proteases thrombin, and most<br>
importantly Factor Xa. The Factor Xa inhibitors of this<br>
invention are potentially useful for the prophylaxis or<br>
treatment of thrombotic disorders such as amongst others<br>
venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, arterial thrombosis,<br>
myocardial ischaemia, myocardial infarction, and cerebral<br>
thrombosis. They potentially have benefit in the treatment of<br>
acute vessel closure associated with thrombolytic therapy and<br>
restenosis, e.g. after transluminal coronary angioplasty or<br>
bypass grafting of the coronary or peripheral arteries and in<br>
the maintenance of vascular access patency in long term<br>
hemodialysis patients.<br>
Factor Xa inhibitors of this invention may, with benefit,<br>
form part of a combination therapy with an anticoagulant with<br>
a different mode of action or with a thrombolytic agent.<br>
It has been reported in W099/11658 and W099/11657 that certain benzamidine<br>
and aminoisoquinoline derivatives carrying a bulky lipophilic side chain are excellent<br>
inhibitors of serine proteases. Unfortunately, it has since been found that benzamidine<br>
compounds of WO 99/11658 in general demonstrate poor oral bioavailability.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that certain other aromatic compounds also<br>
show inhibitory activity against serine proteases, in particular Factor Xa, despite the lack<br>
of the amidino or 1-aminoisoquinoline functionality previously believed to be crucial for<br>
activity as a factor Xa inhibitor. Many of these compounds also possess other structural<br>
features that further distinguish them from the compounds of W099/11658 and<br>
W099/11657.<br>
Where compounds of the invention have been tested, they have generally<br>
demonstrated superior oral bioavailability in comparison with benzamidines disclosed in<br>
WO 99/11658. Also, it has been found that the compounds of the invention perform<br>
excellently in the prothrombin time assay (PT) when compared to aminoisoquinolines of<br>
similar factor Xa activity and structure. The PT assay is a coagulation assay and it is<br>
widely accepted that direct acting Factor Xa inhibitors which perform well in the PT<br>
assay are more likely to be good antithrombotics.<br>
In W099/09053 certain 2-aminobenzamide compounds are disclosed as potential<br>
motilin receptor antagonists and in US 3268513 similar 2-aminobenzamide compounds<br>
are suggested as potential antibacterial agents. However, the novel compounds of the<br>
present invention have not before been suggested as potential serine protease inhibitors.<br>

The compounds of the invention may be prepared by<br>
conventional chemical synthetic routes or by routes as<br>
illustrated by the following examples.<br>
The compounds of the formula (I) may be prepared by<br>
forming the -X-X- bond from appropriate intermediates. For<br>
example, when -X-X- is -CONH- or -CO-NR1a-, by reacting a<br>
compound of the formula (10): H2N-Y-(Cy)-L-Lp(D)n with a<br>
compound of the formula R2-COOH, under conditions known for<br>
the formation of an amide bond. The reaction is conveniently<br>
carried out in the presence of a benzotriazole-based reagent<br>
such as 1-hydroxybenzotriazole or l-hydroxy-7-<br>
azabenzotriazole, in an inert organic solvent such as<br>
dimethylformamide and/or methylene chloride. The reaction<br>
mixture is usually taken to 0°C and then a dehydrating agent<br>
such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-<br>
3-ethylcarbodiimide added. Other suitable reagents and<br>
solvents are known in the art, for example an acid halide,<br>
such as R2-COCI.<br>
Compounds wherein -X-X- is -NHCO- or -NHCH2- may be<br>
formed from the appropriate intermediates using reaction<br>
conditions for the formation of an amide bond as described<br>
above and if necessary subsequent reduction of the resulting<br>
amide bond.<br>
Compounds of the formula (I) wherein -X-X- is of the<br>
formula -CH2NH- may be prepared by reducing the corresponding<br>
compound of the formula (I) wherein -X-X- is -CONH- or by<br>
reaction of a compound of formula (10): H2N-Y-(Cy)-L-Lp(D)n<br>
with a compound of the formula R2CHO and reducing the<br>
intermediate of the formula (I) wherein -X-X- is -C=N- with,<br>
for example, sodium cyanoborohydride.<br>
When -X-X- is -CH=CH-, the compounds of the formula (I)<br>
may be prepared using the Wittig or Horner-Emmons reactions.<br>
The corresponding compound in which -X-X- is -CH2CH2- can be<br>
formed by reduction of the -CH=CH- group, for example with<br>
hydrogen over a palladium-on-carbon catalyst.<br>
An -X-X- bond of the formula -COO- or -OC(O)- may be<br>
formed by reacting the appropriate hydroxy and activated<br>
carboxylic acid (e.g. acid chloride or reactive ester)<br>
intermediates under conditions known for ester bond formation.<br>
Alternatively, a hydroxy and a carboxylic acid intermediate<br>
could be reacted together in the presence of<br>
diethylazodicarboxylate/triphenylphosphine.<br>
An -X-X- bond of the formula -CH2O- or -OCH2- may be<br>
formed by reacting the appropriate hydroxy intermediate with<br>
the appropriate alkyl halide in the presence of a base.<br>
Conditions for the formation of an ether bond are known in the<br>
art.<br>
These reactions can also be used to form intermediates,<br>
which contain one of the above -X-X- bonds.<br>
Compounds of the formula (I) in which Rr is -(CH2)c-Rc<br>
may also be prepared by reductive coupling a compound of the<br>
formula (11):<br>
with a compound of formula (12)<br>
OHC-(CH2)c-l-RC<br>
The reaction is conveniently performed in the presence of<br>
a reducing agent, such as sodium cyanobrohydride. Convenient<br>
solvents include alcohols, such as methanol, optionally with a<br>
halogenated hydrocarbon as solvent, such as 1,2-<br>
dichloroethane, and acetic acid. The coupling is conveniently<br>
effected at a temperature in the range of from 0 to 100°C.<br>
The intermediates of formula (11) are believed to be<br>
novel, and are provided as a further aspect of the invention.<br>
The intermediates of formula (11) in which X-X is CONH<br>
may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula (13)<br><br>
in which Pg1 represents an amino protecting group, such as t-<br>
butoxycarbonyl, with a compound of formula R2-COOH, under<br>
conditions known for the formation of an amide bond, for<br>
example as described hereinabove for forming a compound of<br>
formula (I) , followed by deprotection.<br>
The compounds of formula (13) may be prepared by reacting<br>
an appropriate N-protected glycine of formula (14)<br><br>
in which Pg2 represents an amino protecting group that can be<br>
selectively removed in the presence of Pg1 (for example, when<br>
Pg1 is t-butoxycarbonyl, Pg2 may be benzyloxycarbonyl) , with a<br>
compound of formula (15)<br>
under amide bond forming conditions, followed by selectively-<br>
removing the protecting group Pg2.<br>
Compounds of the formula (10) in which X is CONH may be<br>
5 prepared by deprotecting a compound of the formula (16);<br><br>
in which Pg3 represents an amino protecting group', such as t-<br>
butoxycarbonyl.<br>
The intermediates of formula (16) and the corresponding<br>
amines without Pg3 are believed to be novel, and are provided<br>
as a further aspect of the invention.<br>
Compounds of formula (16) may be prepared by reacting a<br>
compound of formula (14) with a compound of formula (17)<br><br>
under amide bond forming conditions. The reaction is<br>
conveniently performed in the presence of diethylcyano-<br>
phosphate. Convenient solvents include amides, such as<br>
dimethylformamide. The temperature is conveniently in the<br>
range of from 0 to 100 °c.<br>
Compounds of formula (17) in which Rr is -(CH2)C-Rc may<br>
be prepared by reacting a compound of formula (18)<br><br>
in which Pg4 represents an amino protecting group, such as t-<br>
butoxycarbonyl, with a compound of formula (19)<br>
followed by removing the protecting group, Pg4. The reaction<br>
is conveniently performed in the presence of an acid, such as<br>
acetic acid. Convenient solvents include alcohols, such as<br>
ethanol.<br>
Compounds of formula (17) in which Rr is -(CH2)C-RC may<br>
also be prepared by reacting a compound of formula (18) with a<br>
compound of formula (19a)<br>
Z-(CH2)C-RC<br>
in which Z represents a leaving atom or group, such as<br>
methanesulfonyloxy or benzenesulfonyloxy, followed by removing<br>
the protecting group, Pg4.<br>
Compounds of formula (17) in which Rr is -(CH2)C-RC may<br>
also be prepared by reducing compounds of formula (20) or<br>
formula (20A)<br><br>
in which Pg5 and Pg6 each represent an amino protecting group,<br>
such as t-butoxycarbonyl, followed by removing the protecting<br>
group, Pg5. The reduction is conveniently performed in the<br>
presence of a reducing agent, such as borane, in an ether such<br>
as tetrahydrofuran.<br>
Compounds of formula (20) may be prepared by reacting a<br>
compound of formula (18) with a compound of formula (21)<br>
HOOC-(CH2)C-1-Rc<br>
under amide bond forming conditions.<br>
Alternatively, compounds of formula (20) may be prepared<br>
by reacting a compound of formula (18) with a compound of<br>
formula (21a)<br>
in which X1 is a hydrogen atom, such as bromine, followed by-<br>
reaction with a compound of formula (21b)<br>
HRC<br>
in the presence of a strong base, such as sodium hydride.<br>
Hence the present invention also provides a process for<br>
the preparation of a compound of formula (I) comprising:<br>
a) when -X-X is -CONH-, reacting a compound of formula (10)<br>
with a compound of formula R2-COOH, under amide bond-forming<br>
conditions; or<br>
b) when Rr is - (CH2) C-Rc reacting a compound of formula<br>
(11) with a compound of (12);<br>
wherein R2, X, Y, Cy, c and Rr are as hereinabove defined and<br>
formulae (10) , (11) and (12) are as hereinabove defined,<br>
followed if a salt is required, by forming a physiologically<br>
acceptable salt.<br>

hydroxylamine with a compound of formula Cy-CO-COOPg).<br>
A starting material for the preparation of a compound of<br>
formula (I), where the alpha atom is nitrogen, may be<br>
produced, for example, by reaction of a beta protected<br>
hydrazine (such protection to be chosen as to be compatible<br>
with the subsequent reagents to be employed) with phosgene,<br>
diphosgene, triphosgene or N,N'carbonyl<br>
diimidazole to give a reactive compound of the type<br>
PGNHN(Cy)COCl or PGNHN(Cy)CO-imidazole (wherein PG is a<br>
protecting group),<br>
This intermediate may be used as has been described above<br>
for the carboxylic starting reagents where the alpha atom is<br>
carbon.<br>
The skilled person will be aware that at certain stages<br>
in the synthesis of a compound of formula (I) it may be<br>
necessary to protect a reactive functional group in the<br>
molecule to prevent unwanted side-reactions.<br>
The protection of amino and carboxylic acid groups is<br>
described in McOmie, Protecting Groups in Organic Chemistry,<br>
Plenum Press, NY, 1973, and Greene and Wuts, Protecting Groups<br>
in Organic Synthesis, 2nd. Ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, NY, 1991.<br>
Examples of carboxy protecting groups include C1_-C6 alkyl<br>
groups such as methyl, ethyl, t-butyl and t-amyl; ary (C1-<br>
C4)alkyl groups such as benzyl, 4-nitrobenzyl, 4-<br>
methoxybenzyl, 3,4-dimethoxybenzyl, 2,4-dimethoxybenzyl,<br>
2,4,6 -trimethoxybenzyl, 2,4,6-trimethylbenzyl, benzhydryl and<br>
trityl; silyl groups such as trimethylsilyl and t-<br>
butyldimethylsilyl; and allyl groups such as allyl and 1-<br>
(tritnethylsilylmethyl)prop-l-en-3-yl.<br>
Examples of amine protecting groups (PG) include acyl<br>
groups, such as groups of formula RCO in which R represents<br>
C1-6 alkyl, C3-10 cycloalkyl, phenyl C1-6 alkyl, phenyl, C1-6<br>
alkoxy, phenyl C1-6 alkoxy, or a C3-10 cycloalkoxy, wherein a<br>
phenyl group may be optionally substituted, for example by one<br>
or two of halogen, C1-C4 alkyl and C1-C4 alkoxy.<br>
Preferred amino protecting groups include<br>
benzyloxycarbonyl (CBz), t-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) and benzyl.<br>
In another aspect the invention relates to a process for<br>
preparing a compound of formula I comprising deprotecting a<br>
compound of formula (I') :<br>

Wherein R2' is R2 (as hereinabove defined) or protected R2, Cy'<br>
is Cy (as hereinabove defined) or protected Cy and Lp(D)n' is<br>
Lp(D)n (as hereinabove defined) or protected Lp(D)n; providing<br>
at least one protecting group is present.<br>
If necessary physiologically tolerable salts can be<br>
formed using methods known in the art.<br>
It will be understood that the compounds of formula (I)<br>
may be isolated in the form of salts or solvates (which may or<br>
may not be physiologically tolerable) , and that all such salts<br>
and solvates are therefore included within the scope of the<br>
present invention.<br>

rectally or orally), the nose, lungs, musculature or<br>
vasculature or transdermally. The compounds may be<br>
administered in any convenient administrative form, e.g.<br>
tablets, powders, capsules, solutions, dispersions,<br>
suspensions, syrups, sprays, suppositories, gels, emulsions,<br>
patches etc. Such compositions may contain components<br>
conventional in pharmaceutical preparations, e.g. diluents,<br>
carriers, pH modifiers, sweeteners, bulking agents, and<br>
further active agents. Preferably the compositions will be<br>
sterile and in a solution or suspension form suitable for<br>
injection or infusion. Such compositions form a further<br>
aspect of the invention.<br>
The following are examples of pharmaceutical compositions<br>
of compounds according to the invention.<br>
The above ingredients are mixed and filled into hard<br>
gelatin capsules in 460 mg quantities.<br>
The active ingredient, starch, and cellulose are passed<br>
through a No. 45 mesh U.S. sieve and mixed thoroughly. The<br>
solution of polyvinylpyrrolidone is mixed with the resultant<br>
powders which are then passed through a No. 14 mesh U.S.<br>
sieve. The granules so produced are dried at 50°C and passed<br>
through a No. 18 mesh U.S. sieve. The sodium carboxymethyl<br>
starch, magnesium stearate, and talc, previously passed<br>
through a No. 60 mesh U.S. sieve, are then added to the<br>
granules which, after mixing, are compressed on a tablet<br>
machine to yield tablets each weighing 15 0 mg.<br>

inhibitor according to the invention together with at least<br>
one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. The<br>
pharmaceutical composition may also optionally comprise at<br>
least one further antithrombotic and/or thrombolytic agent.<br>
Viewed from a further aspect the invention provides the<br>
use of a serine protease inhibitor according to the invention<br>
for the manufacture of a medicament for use in a method of<br>
treatment of the human or non-human animal body (e.g. a<br>
mammalian, avian or reptilian body) to combat (i.e. treat or<br>
prevent) a condition responsive to said inhibitor.<br>
Viewed from a further aspect the invention provides a<br>
method of treatment of the human or non-human animal body<br>

Isonipecotic acid (15.0 g, 116 mmol) was dissolved in THF (300<br>
mL), water (150 mL) and 6 N NaOH (4 0 mL). Di-tert-butyl<br>
dicarbonate (26.6 g, 122 mmol) was added and the mixture<br>
stirred overnight. The mixture was diluted with water and<br>
ethyl acetate, and the layers separated. The water layers<br>
were extracted with ethyl acetate, and the organic layers<br>
discarded. The water layer was diluted with KHSO4 (2 N, pH~4)<br>
and extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was<br>
washed with brine, dried (Na2SO4) , filtered and concentrated<br>
to provide 1-Boc-isonipecotic acid (23.9 g, 90%) as a white<br>

(180 mL, 1 N in THF, 180 mmol) was added slowly. The mixture<br>
stirred for 1 h at 0 °C and was allowed to warm to room<br>
temperature for 12 h. The mixture was carefully quenched with<br>
water and diluted with ethyl acetate. The water layer was<br>
extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layers were<br>
combined, washed with brine, dried (Na2SO4), filtered and<br>
concentrated to provide l-Boc-piperidine-4-methanol (7.98 g,<br>

The product prepared by both the method of Example 4 8a<br>
and Example 48a (Alternative Synthesis) was found to be the<br>
mono-hydrochloride salt and to be amorphous. Analysis by<br>
microscopy showed glassy non-birefringent particles; and<br>
analysis by DSC failed to reveal a melting point, in agreement<br>
with amorphous material. Using a microbalance flow system,<br>
the original material was cycled through a vapor pressure<br>
isotherm determination, where the material deliquesced, then<br>
allowed to deydrate. Upon dehydration, there were formed<br>
crystals which were birefringent by microscopy; and a melting<br>
point of about 174 °C was demonstrated for the newly<br>
crystallized, hygroscopic material.<br>
Example 48b<br>

 The difumarate salt is conveniently prepared by<br>
dissolving the free base in methanol or 95% ethanol and<br>
warming to about 50 °C (for example at a concentration of 460<br>
mg in 15 mL) . Two molar equivalents of fumaric acid (for<br>
example 232.2 mg) are then added (for example, as a 0.25 M<br>
solution in methanol or as a suspension in 3 mL 9 5% ethanol) .<br>
Following cooling and crystallization, and isolation and<br>
drying, the product is obtained as thin crystalline needles,<br>
with a sharp melting point at about 213 °C by DSC.<br>

Assay protocols<br>
Enzyme Inhibition assays:<br>
The ability of a test compound to inhibit factor Xa may be<br>
evaluated in one or more of the following Enzyme Inhibition<br>
assays, or in other standard assays known to those skilled in<br>
the art.<br>
Enzyme Inhibition Assay 1<br>
Enzyme assays were carried out at room temperature in 0.1M<br>
phosphate buffer, pH7.4 according to the method of Tapparelli<br>
et al (J. Biol. Chem. 1993,268,4734-4741) . Purified human<br>
factor Xa, trypsin, tnrombin and plasmin were purchased from<br>
Alexis Corporation, Nottingham, UK. Urokinase was purchased<br>
from Calbiochem, Nottingham, UK. Chromogenic substrates for<br>
these enzymes; pefachrome-FXA, pefachrome-TRY, pefachrome-TH,<br>
pefachrome-PL and pefachrome-UK were purchased from Pentapharm<br>
AG, Basel, Switzerland. Product (p-nitroaniline) was<br>
quantified by adsorption at 405nm in 96 well microplates using<br>
a Dynatech MR5000 reader (Dynex Ltd, Billingshurst, UK). Km<br>
and Ki were calculated using SAS PROC NLIN (SAS Institute,<br>
Cary, NC, USA, Release 6.11) Km values were determined as<br>
100.9µM for factor Xa/pefachrome-FXA and 81.6µM for<br>
trypsin/pefachrome-TRY. Inhibitor stock solutions were<br>
prepared at 40mM in Me2S0 and tested at 500µM, 50uM and 5µM.<br>
Accuracy of Ki measurements was confirmed by comparison with<br>
Ki values of known inhibitors of factor Xa and trypsin.<br>
In agreement with published data, benzamidine inhibited factor<br>
Xa, trypsin, thrombin, plasmin and urokinase with Ki values of<br>
155µM, 2lµM, 330nM, 200nM and 100nM respectively. NAPAP<br>
inhibited thrombin with a Ki value of 3nM. Compounds of the<br>
invention were found to have activity in these assays.<br>
Enzyme Inhibition Assay 2<br>
Human factor Xa and human thrombin were purchased from Enzyme<br>
Research Laboratories (South Bend, Indiana, USA). Other<br>
proteases were from other commercial sources. Chromogenic<br>
para-nitroanilide peptide protease substrates were purchased<br>
from Midwest Biotech (Fishers, Indiana, USA).<br>
The binding affinities for human factor Xa were measured as<br>
apparent association constants (Kass) derived from protease<br>
inhibition kinetics as described previously.a,b,c,d The<br>
apparent Kass values were obtained using automated (BioMek-<br>
1000) dilutions of inhibitors (Kass determinations are<br>
performed in triplicate at each of four-eight inhibitor<br>
concentrations) into 96-well plates and chromogenic substrate<br>
hydrolysis rates determined at 405 nm using a Thermomax plate<br>
reader from Molecular Devices (San Francisco). For factor Xa<br>
inhibition, the assay protocol was: 50 µl buffer (0.06 M tris,<br>
0.3 M NaCl, pH 7.4); 25 µl inhibitor test solution (in MeOH);<br>
25 µl human factor Xa (32 nM in 0.03 M tris, 0.15 M NaCl, 1<br>
mg/ml HSA) ; finally, 150 µl BzIleGluGlyArgpNA (0.3 mM in water)<br>
added within 2 min to start hydrolysis. Final factor Xa was<br>
3.2 nM. Free [Xa] and bound [Xa] were determined from linear<br>
standard curves on the same plate by use of SoftmaxPro<br>
software for each inhibitor concentration and apparent Kass<br>
calculated for each inhibitor concentration which produced<br>
hydrolysis inhibition between 20% and 80% of the control (3.2<br>
nM factor Xa) : apparent Kass = [E:I]/[Ef] [If] =<br>
[Eb] / [Ef] [Io-Ib] . The apparent Kass values so obtained are<br>
approximately the inverse of the Ki for the respective<br>
inhibitors [1/appKass = app Ki] . The variability of mean<br>
apparent Kass values determined at the single substrate -<br>
concentration was +/- 15%. The assay system Km was measured<br>
as 0.347 +/- 0.031 mM [n=4] ; and Vmax was 13.11 +/- 0.76<br>
uM/min.<br>
Kass values were determined with thrombin and other proteases<br>
using the same protocol with the following enzyme and<br>
substrate concentrations: thrombin 5.9 nM with 0.2 mM<br>
BzPheValArgpNA; XIa 1.2 nM with 0.4 mM pyroGluProArgpNA; Xlla<br>
10 nM with 0.2 mM HDPr oPheArgpNA; plasmin 3 . 4 nM with 0.5 mM<br>
HDValLeuLyspNA; nt-PA 1.2 nM with 0.8 mM HDIleProArgpNA; and<br>
urokinase 0.4 nM with 0.4 mM pyroGluGlyArgpNA; aPC 3 nM with<br>
0.174 mM pyroGluProArgpNA; plasma kallikrein 1. S nM with D-<br>
ProPheArgpNA; bovine trypsin 1.4 nM with 0.18 mM<br>
BzPheValArgpNA.<br>

The ability of a test compound to elongate Partial<br>
Thromboplastin Time (Prothrombin Time) may be evaluated in the<br>
following test protocols.<br>
Partial Thromboplastin Time (Prochrombin) Test Protocol<br>
Venous blood was collected into 3.2% (0.109m) trisodium<br>
citrate vacutainer tubes at 1 volume of anticoagulant to nine<br>
volumes of blood. The blood cells were separated by<br>
centrifugation at 700g for ten minutes to yield plasma, which<br>
was frozen at 70°C until required.<br>
To perform the test, l00µl of plasma was pipetted into in a<br>
glass test tube, 1µl of test compound in DMSO was added, and<br>
allowed to warm to 37° over two minutes. l00µl of warm (37°)<br>
Manchester (tissue thromboplasin) reagent (Helena Biosciences,<br>
UK) was added, allowed to equilibrate for two minutes. lOOul<br>
of warm (37°) 25mM calcium chloride solution was added to<br>
initiate clotting. The test tube was tilted three times<br>
through a 90° angle every five seconds to mix the reagents and<br>
the time to clot formation recorded. Data from a series of<br>
observations and test compound concentrations are analysed by<br>
a SAS statistical analysis' program and a CT2 (Concentration<br>
required to double clotting time) for each compound is<br>
generated.<br>
Compounds of the invention were found to significantly<br>
elongate the partial thromboplastin time (Prothrombin time).<br>
Alternative Prothrombin Time and APTT Protocols<br>
Coagulation Determinations. Prothrombin Times and APTT values<br>
were determined in HUMAN PLASMA with a STA instrument (Stago) .<br>
BioPT is a special non-plasma clotting assay triggered with<br>
human tissue factor (Innovin). Possible binding to albumen or<br>
to lipid was assessed by comparing the BioPT effects in the<br>
presence/absence of 3 0 mg/ml human albumen (HSA) and 1 mg/ml<br>
phosphatidyl choline (PC) . Inhibitors were delivered in 50%<br>
