				<td>Crystalline anti-hTNFalpha antibodies<br>
The present invention relates to a batch crystallization method for crystallizing an anti-hTNFalpha antibody which allows the production of said antibody on an industrial scale; antibody crystals as obtained according to said method; compositions containing said crystals as well as methods of use of said crystals and compositions.<br>
Technical Background a) Antibody crystals<br>
With over 100 monoclonal antibodies currently being evaluated in clinical study phases 2 or 3, the mAb market can be considered one of the most promising biopharmaceuti-cal markets. As these drugs have to be delivered in single doses often exceeding 100 mg, there is an urgent need to find suitable formulation strategies satisfying stability, safety and patient compliance.<br>
However, highly concentrated liquid mAb formulations show increased viscosity, hindering syringe ability through patient friendly thin needles. Furthermore, the aggregation tendency of mAb molecules at such high concentrations exponentially increases when compared to moderately concentrated solutions. This is unacceptable, in all means, regarding safety and stability requirements.<br>
Thus, the delivery of high mAb doses is restrained to large volumes, which generally have to be delivered via infusion. This way of dosing is cost intensive and significantly reduces the patient's compliance.<br>
Therefore, pharmaceutically applicable low volume mAb crystal suspensions for subcutaneous injection would be highly desirable. Theoretically, degradation pathways influencing the mAb integrity should be significantly decelerated due to the rigidity of a crystal lattice, where motions in the protein structure are hindered. Moreover, it can be expected that the increase in viscosity would be significantly reduced when comparing highly concentrated crystal suspensions with liquid formulations. With respect to sustained release, it might be possible to generate or alter protein crystals in that way that they dissolve slowly when brought into the patient's body. This would be a very elegant<br>
way to deliver a sustained release formulation, as the extensive use of excipients and processes harming the mAb structure would be prevented.<br>
Despite the great potential in using protein crystals as drug substance, few attempts have been made to systematically evaluate this strategy.<br>
A well-known exemption is insulin, which was successfully crystallized decades ago. Today, the use of crystal suspensions of insulin is well described, offering stable and long acting formulations being well established on the market. The discrepancy between the development of insulin crystals and crystallization of all other proteins might be related to the fact that ordered insulin aggregates are natively formed in the pancreas. Thus, insulin crystals are easily obtained when insulin is brought in contact with an excess of zinc ions. Most other proteins tend to form unordered precipitates rather than crystals, and therefore, finding crystallization conditions for a protein is a time consuming, non-trivial task.<br>
Despite a great interest in harvesting protein crystals for x-ray diffraction analysis, the quest of finding suitable crystallization conditions still is an empirical science, as in principle any protein behaves differently. To date, no general rule has been found which might reliably predict by reason alone a successful crystallization condition for a protein of choice. Thus, obtaining crystals of a given protein always is referred to be the "bottle neck" of whatever intended application is planned later on.<br>
To make things even more challenging, antibodies are described to be especially hard to crystallize, due to the flexibility of the molecule.<br>
Nevertheless, examples of immunoglobulin crystals have been known for a long time. The first example of immunoglobulin crystals were described 150 years ago by an English physician, Henry Bence Jones; he isolated crystals of an abnormal Ig light chain dimer from the urine of a myeloma patient (Jones 1848). Such abnormal Igs have been known ever since as Bence Jones proteins. In 1938, the spontaneous crystallization of a distinct abnormal Ig from the serum of a myeloma patient was described (von Bons-dorf, Groth et al. 1938), apparently an Ig heavy chain oligomer (MW 200 kDa).<br>
Crystalline human immunoglobulins of normal structure (two heavy chains linked to two light chains) were described over the next thirty years, again mostly isolated from myeloma patients (Putnam 1955). Davies and co-workers were the first to characterize the structure of an intact human myeloma antibody, named "Dob", using x-ray crystallography (Terry, Matthews et al. 1968), and they determined its three-dimensional structure in 1971 (Sarma, Silverton et al. 1971). Their pioneering work was followed by that of others, yielding the crystal structures of the IgG "Kol" (Huber, Deisenhofer et al. 1976), the IgG "Mcg"(Rajan, Ely et al. 1983), and a canine lymphoma lgG2a (Harris, Larson et al. 1992).<br>
Crystals of immunoglobulins retain their distinctive immunological activities upon re-dissolution. Nisonoff et al. reported in 1968 on a rabbit anti-p-azobenzoate antibody, "X4", that was easily crystallized. Antibody X4 was extensively characterized before crystallization as well as after re-dissolution of the crystals. [125l]-p-iodobenzoate was found to bind specifically and potently to re-dissolved X4; the re-dissolved crystals also exhibited multiple specific Ouchterlony immunodiffusion reactions typical of the unpuri-fied rabbit serum (Nisonoff, Zappacosta et al. 1968). Connell and co-workers described a human myeloma gamma-immunoglobulin-1 kappa (IgG-K), called Tern", that crystallized spontaneously from serum at cold temperatures (Connell, Freedman et al. 1973). Tern crystals were found to be well-formed and possessed rhombohedral symmetry. Tern-containing serum was extensively characterized by agarose immunodiffusion techniques. Electrophoresis and immunodiffusion of a re-dissolved solution of the Tem crystals showed them to be identical with the material obtained from the serum by cryoprecipitation, and with the isolated myeloma protein (Connell, Freedman et al. 1973).<br>
Mills and co-workers reported in 1983 an unusual crystallocryoglobulinemia resulting from human monoclonal antibodies to albumin (Mills, Brettman et al. 1983). Here, very similar cuboidal crystals were isolated from two patients. Redissolution of the crystals followed by electrophoresis and immunoelectrophoresis indicated that the crystals were composed of two protein components, a monoclonal IgG-lambda and human serum albumin in a 1:2 ratio (Jentoft, Dearborn et al. 1982). The components were separated on preparative scale by dissolution of the original crystals followed by column chroma-tography. Although neither separated component crystallized on its own, upon recombination the original bipartite complex reformed and then crystallized. Further study of<br>
the distinctive sedimentation characteristics and immunological reactivity of the redis-solved, separated IgG and its Fab fragment with human serum albumin indicated that reassociation of the two redissolved, separated components was immunologic in nature, i.e. that the crystalline antibody once redissolved still possessed its native, highly specific (for human serum albumin) binding characteristics (Mills, Brettman et al. 1983).<br>
Recently, Margolin and co-workers reported on the potential therapeutic uses of crystalline antibodies (Yang, Shenoy et al. 2003). They found that the therapeutic monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin®) could be crystallized (Shenoy, Govardhan et al. 2002). Crystalline trastuzumab suspensions were therapeutically efficacious in a mouse tumor model, thus demonstrating retention of biological activity by crystalline trastuzumab (Yang, Shenoy et al. 2003).<br>
b) Crystallization techniques<br>
Unlike some other scientific or engineering endeavors, the crystallization of diverse proteins cannot be carried out successfully using defined methods or algorithms. Certainly, there have been great technical advances in the last 20-30 years, as noted by the world-renowned expert in protein crystallization, A. McPherson. McPherson provides extensive details on tactics, strategies, reagents, and devices for the crystallization of macromolecules. He does not, however, provide a method to ensure that any given macromolecule can indeed be crystallized by a skilled person with reasonable expectation of success. McPherson states for example : 'Whatever the procedure, no effort must be spared in refining and optimizing the parameters of the system, both solvent and solute, to encourage and promote specific bonding interactions between molecules and to stabilize them once they have formed. This latter aspect of the problem generally depends on the specific chemical and physical properties of the particular protein or nucleic acid being crystallized." (McPherson 1999, p. 159)<br>
It is widely accepted by those skilled in the art of protein crystallization that no algorithm exists to take a new protein of interest, apply definite process steps, and thereby obtain the desired crystals.<br>
Several screening systems a commercially available (for example Hampton 1 and 2, Wizzard I and II) which allow, on a microliter scale, to screen for potentially suitable<br>
crystallization conditions for a specific protein. However, positive results obtained in such a screening system do not necessarily allow successful crystallization in a larger, industrially applicable batch scale. Conversion of microliter-size crystallization trials into industrial dimensions is described to be a challenging task (see Jen et at., 2001).<br>
Baldock et al (1996) reported on a comparison of microbatch and vapor diffusion for initial screening of crystallization conditions. Six commercially available proteins were screened using a set of crystallization solutions. The screens were performed using the most common vapor diffusion method and three variants of a microbatch crystallization method, including a novel evaporation technique. Out of 58 crystallization conditions identified, 43 (74%) were identified by microbatch, while 41 (71%) were identified by vapor diffusion. Twenty-six conditions were found by both methods, and 17 (29%) would have been missed if microbatch had not been used at all. This shows that the vapor diffusion technique, which is most commonly used in initial crystallization screens does not guarantee positive results.<br>
c) hTNFalpha antibody crystals<br>
Human TNFalpha (hTNFalpha) is considered as a causative agent of numerous diseases. There is, therefore, a great need for suitable methods of treating such hTNFalpha related disorders. One promising therapeutic approach comprises the administration of pharmaceutically effective doses of anti-human TNFalpha antibodies. Recently one such antibody, designated D2E7, or generically adalimumab, has been put on the market and is commercialised under the trade name HUMIRA®.<br>
WO-A-02/072636 disclosed the crystallization of the whole, intact antibodies Rituximab, Infliximab and Trastuzumab. Most of the crystallization experiments were performed with chemicals with unclear toxicity, like imidazole, 2-cyclohexyl-ethanesulfonate (CHES), methylpentanediol, copper sulphate, and 2-morpholino-ethanesulfonate (MES). Most of the examples used seed crystals to initiate crystallization.<br>
WO-A-2004/009776 disclosed crystallization experiments in the microliter scale using the sitting drop vapor diffusion technique by mixing equal volumes (1 pi) of different crystallization buffers and D2E7 F(ab)'2 or Fab fragments. While several experimental<br>
conditions were reported for each of said fragments, no successful crystallization of the whole, intact D2E7 antibody was reported.<br>
Methods for preparing crystals of any given anti-human TNFalpha whole antibodies, in particular of D2E7, therefore are not available.<br>
The problem to be solved according to the present invention is, therefore, to develop suitable batch crystallization conditions for anti-hTNFalpha antibodies, in particular for the human anti-hTNFalpha antibody D2E7, and to establish crystallization process conditions applicable to volumes relevant for industrial antibody crystal production. At the same time a crystallization process should be established that does not make use of toxic agents, which might negatively affect the pharmaceutical applicability of such antibodies.<br>
Summary of the Invention:<br>
The above-mentioned problem was, surprisingly, solved by the finding that it is possible to obtain crystals of a whole anti-hTNFalpha antibody in batch crystallization volumes above the microliter scale by applying physiologically acceptable inorganic phosphate salts as the crystallization-inducing agent.<br>
Preferred Embodiments<br>
In a first aspect the invention relates to a batch crystallization method for crystallizing an anti-hTNFalpha antibody, comprising the steps of:<br>
a)	providing an aqueous solution of said antibody in admixture with an inorganic<br>
phosphate salt as crystallization agent, as for example by mixing an aqueous so<br>
lution of said antibody, wherein the antibody preferably is present in dissolved<br>
form, with an aqueous crystallization solution comprising an inorganic phosphate<br>
salt as crystallization agent in dissolved form, or alternatively by adding said crys<br>
tallization agent in solid form; and<br>
b)	incubating said aqueous crystallization mixture until crystals of said antibody are<br>
formed.<br>
The crystallization method of the invention generally is performed at a pH of said aqueous crystallization mixture in the range of about pH 3 to about 5, in particular about 3.5 to about 4.5, or about 3.7 to about 4.2.<br>
Moreover, said aqueous crystallization mixture may contain at least one buffer. Said buffer may, in particular, comprise an acetate component as main component, especially an alkali metal salt, in particular, sodium acetate. Said salt is adjusted by addition of an acid, in particular acetic acid, to the required pH. In a preferred embodiment of the crystallization method, the buffer concentration (total acetate) in said aqueous crystallization mixture is 0 to about 0.5 M, or about 0.02 to about 0.5 M, as for example about 0.05 to about 0.3 M, or about 0.15 to about 0.2 M.<br>
In a further particular embodiment of the crystallization method according to the invention, the phosphate salt used as the precipitating agent is selected from hydrogen-phosphate salts, such as mono- or dihydrogenphosphate salts, in particular an ammonium salt or an alkali metal salt, for example a salt containing Na* or K+ ions, or a mixture thereof comprising of at least two different salts. Suitable examples are: NaH2PO4. Na2HPO4. KH2PO4. K2HPO4, NH4H2PO4. (NH4)2HPO4, and mixtures thereof.<br>
In particular, the phosphate salt concentration in the crystallization mixture is in the range of about 1 to about 6 M, for example a range of about 1.0 to about 4.0 M, or about 1.0 to about 3.0 M, or about 1.5 to about 2.8 M, or about 2.0 to about 2.6M.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, protein solution and crystallization solution are combined in a ratio of about 1:1. Thus, molarities of the buffering agents / crystallization agents in the original crystallization solution are about double as high as in the crystallization mixture.<br>
Typically, the crystallization method is performed in a batch volume in the range of about 1 ml to about 200001, or 1 ml to about 150001, or 1 ml to about 120001, or about 1 ml to about 10000 I, or 1 ml to about 6000 I, or 1 ml to about 3000 I, or 1 ml to about 1000 I, or 1 ml to about 100 I, as for example about 50 ml to about 8000 ml, or about 100 ml to about 5000 ml, or about 1000 ml to about 3000 ml; or about 1 I to about 1000 I; or about 10 I to about 5001.<br>
In addition, the crystallization method of the invention may be performed so that at least one of the following additional crystallization conditions is achieved:<br>
a)	incubation is performed for between about 1 hour to about 60 days, for example<br>
about 1 to about 30 days, or about 2 to 10 days;<br>
b)	incubation is performed at a temperature between about 0 °C and about 50 °C,<br>
for example about 4 °C and about 37 °C;<br>
c)	the antibody concentration (i.e. protein concentration) in the crystallization mix<br>
ture is in the range of about 1 to 200 mg/ml or 1 to 100 mg/ml, for example 1.5 to<br>
20 mg/ml, in particular in the range of about 2 to 15 mg/ml, or 5 to 10 mg/ml. The<br>
protein concentration may be determined according to standard procedures for<br>
protein determination.<br>
According to a particularly preferred method, crystallization is performed under the following conditions of the crystallization mixture:<br>
Phosphate salt:	NaH2PO4,	1.5 to 2.5 M<br>
buffer:	total acetate,      0 to 0.3 M<br>
pH:	3.6 to 4.2<br>
anti-hTNFalpha concentration:      3 to 10 mg/ml<br>
Temperature:	18 to 24 °C<br>
Batch volume:	1 to 1001<br>
Agitation:	None<br>
Duration:	4 to 15 days<br>
The crystallization mixtures as outlined above are usually obtained by adding a crystallization agent in solution or as solid to the protein solution. Both solutions may be, but do not have to be buffered. Crystallization agent molarity and buffer molarity in the original crystallization solution is usually higher than in the crystallization mixture as it is "diluted" with the protein solution.<br>
In a further embodiment, the crystallization method of the invention may further comprise the step of drying the obtained crystals. Suitable drying methods comprise evaporative drying, spray drying, lyophilization, vacuum drying, fluid bed drying, spray freeze drying, near critical drying, supercritical drying, and nitrogen gas drying.<br>

A "batch method of crystallization" comprises the step of adding the crystallization solution comprising the crystallization agent, preferably in dissolved form, to the solution of the antibody to be crystallized.<br>
A "micro scale crystallization method", which may for example be based upon vapor diffusion, comprises the steps of admixing a small volume of antibody solution in the microliter range with a reservoir buffer containing a crystallization agent; placing a droplet of said mixture in a sealed container adjacent to an aliquot of said reservoir buffer; allowing exchange of solvent between the droplet and the reservoir by vapor diffusion, during which the solvent content in said droplet changes and crystallization may be observed if suitable crystallization conditions are reached.<br>
A "crystallization agent", in the present case a phosphate salt, favors crystal formation of the antibody to be crystallized.<br>
A "crystallization solution" contains said crystallization agent in dissolved form. Preferably said solution is an aqueous system, i.e. the liquid constituents thereof predominantly, consist of water. As for example, 80 to 100 wt.-% or 95 to 100 wt.-% or 98 to 100 wt.-% may be water.<br>
Antibody "crystals" are one form of the solid state of matter of said protein, which is distinct from a second solid form, i.e. the amorphous state, which exists essentially as an unorganized, heterogeneous solid. Crystals have a regular three-dimensional structure, typically referred to as a lattice. An antibody crystal comprises a regular three-dimensional array of antibody molecules. See Giege, R. and Ducruix, A. Barrett, Crystallization of Nucleic Acids and Proteins, a Practical Approach, 2nd ed., pp. 1-16, Oxford University Press, New York (1999).<br>
A "whole" or "intact" anti-hTNFalpha antibody as crystallized according to this invention, is a functional antibody that is able to recognize and bind to its antigen human TNFal-pha in vitro and/or in vivo. The antibody may initiate subsequent immune system reactions of a patient associated with antibody-binding to its antigen, in particular Direct Cytotoxicity, Complement-Dependent Cytotoxicity (CDC), and Antibody-Dependent Cytotoxicity (ADCC). The antibody molecule has a structure composed of two identical heavy chains (MW each about 50 kDa) covalently bound to each other, and two identical light chains (MW each about 25 kDa), each covalently bound to one of the heavy chains. The four chains are arranged in a classic "Y" motif. Each heavy chain is comprised of a heavy chain variable region (abbreviated herein as HCVR or VH) and a heavy chain constant region. The heavy chain constant region is comprised of three domains, CH1, CH2 and CHS. Each light chain is comprised of a light chain variable region (abbreviated herein as LCVR or VL) and a light chain constant region. The light chain constant region is comprised of one domain, CL. The VH and VL regions can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability, termed complementarity determining regions (CDR), interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed framework regions (FR). Each VH and VL is composed of three CDRs and four FRs, arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus in the following order: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4. The complete antibody molecule has two antigen binding sites, i.e. is "bivalent". The two antigen binding sites are specific for one hTNFalpha antigen, i.e. the antibody is "mono-specific".<br>
"Monoclonal antibodies" are antibodies that are derived from a single clone of B lymphocytes (B cells), and recognize the same antigenic determinant. Whole monoclonal antibodies are those that have the above-mentioned classic molecular structure that includes two complete heavy chains and two complete light chains. Monoclonal antibodies are routinely produced by fusing the antibody-producing B cell with an immortal myeloma cell to generate B cell hybridomas, which continually produce monoclonal antibodies in cell culture. Other production methods are available, as for example expression of monoclonal antibodies in bacterial, yeast, insect, or mammalian cell culture using phage-display technology; in vivo production in genetically modified animals, such as cows, goats, pigs, rabbits, chickens, or in transgenic mice which have been modified to contain and express the entire human B cell genome; or production in genetically modified plants, such as tobacco and corn. Anti-hTNFalpha antibodies from all such sources may be crystallized according to this invention.<br>
The monoclonal antibodies to be crystallized according to the invention include "chi-meric" anti-hTNFalpha antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass. As an example there may be mentioned a mouse/human chimera containing variable antigen-binding portions of a murine antibody and constant portions derived from a human antibody.<br>
"Humanized" forms of non-human (e.g. murine) anti-hTNFalpha antibodies are also encompassed. These are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from a non-human immunoglobulin. For the most part, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins in which residues from a complementarity determining region (CDR) or hypervariable loop (HVL) of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by residues from a CDR or HVL of a non-human species, such as mouse, rat, rabbit or non-human primate, having the desired functionality. Framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin may replaced by corresponding non-human residues to improve antigen binding affinity. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are found neither in the corresponding human or non-human antibody portions. These modifications may be necessary to further improve antibody efficacy.<br>
A "human antibody" or "fully human antibody" is one, which has an amino acid sequence which corresponds to that of an antibody produced by a human or which is recombinantly produced. The term "human antibody", as used herein, is intended to include antibodies having variable and constant regions derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences. The human antibodies of the invention may include amino acid residues not encoded by human germline immunoglobulin sequences (e.g. mutations introduced by random or site-specific mutagenesis in vitro or by somatic mutation in vivo), for example in the CDRs and in particular CDR3. However, the term "human antibody", as used herein, is not intended to include antibodies in which CDR sequences derived from the germline of another mammalian species, such as a mouse, have been grafted onto human framework sequences.<br>
The term 'recombinant human antibody", as used herein, is intended to include all human antibodies that are prepared, expressed, created or isolated by recombinant means, such as antibodies expressed using a recombinant expression vector trans-fected into a host cell, antibodies isolated from a recombinant, combinatorial human antibody library, antibodies isolated from an animal (e.g. a mouse) that is transgenic for human immunoglobulin genes (see e.g. Taylor, L.D., et al. (1992) Nucl. Acids Res. 20:6287-6295) or antibodies prepared, expressed, created or isolated by any other means that involves splicing of human immunoglobulin gene sequences to other DMA sequences. Such recombinant human antibodies have variable and constant regions derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences. In certain embodiments, however, such recombinant human antibodies are subjected to in vitro mutagenesis (or, when an animal transgenic for human Ig sequences is used, in vivo somatic mutagenesis) and thus the amino acid sequences of the VH and VL regions of the recombinant antibodies are sequences that, while derived from and related to human germline VH and VL sequences, may not naturally exist within the human antibody germline repertoire in vivo.<br>
A 'neutralizing antibody', as used herein (or an "antibody that neutralized hTNFalpha . activity"), is intended to refer to an antibody whose binding to hTNFalpha results in inhibition of the biological activity of hTNFalpha. This inhibition of the biological activity of hTNFalpha can be assessed by measuring one or more indicators of hTNFalpha biological activity, such as hTNFalpha-induced cytotoxicity (either in vitro or in vivo), hTNFalpha-induced cellular activation and hTNFalpha binding to hTNFalpha receptors. These indicators of hTNFalpha biological activity can be assessed by one or more of several standard in vitro or in vivo assays known in the art. Preferably, the ability of an antibody to neutralize hTNFalpha activity is assessed by inhibition of hTNFalpha-induced cytotoxicity of L929 cells. As an additional or alternative parameter of hTNFalpha activity, the ability of an antibody to inhibit hTNFalpha-induced expression of ELAM-1 on HUVEC, as a measure of hTNFalpha-induced cellular activation, can be assessed.<br>
An "affinity matured" anti-hTNFalpha antibody is one with one or more alterations in one or more hypervariable regions, which result in an improvement in the affinity of the antibody for antigen, compared to a parent antibody. Affinity matured antibodies will have nanomolar or even picomolar affinities values for the target antigen. Affinity ma-<br>
tured antibodies are produced by procedures known in the art. Marks et al., Bio/Technology 10:779-783 (1992) describes affinity maturation by VH and VL domain shuffling. Random mutagenesis of CDR and/or framework residues is described by: Barbas et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 91:3809-3813 (1994); Scier et al., Gene 169:147-155 (1995); Yelton et al., J. Immunol. 155:1994-2004 (1995); Jackson et al., J. Immunol. 154(7):3310-9 (1995); and Hawkins et al., J. Mol Biol. 226:889-896 (1992).<br>
An "isolated antibody", as used herein, is intended to refer to an antibody that is substantially free of other antibodies having different antigenic specificities (e.g. an isolated antibody that specifically binds hTNFalpha is substantially free of antibodies that spe-cifically_bind antigens other than hTNFalpha). An isolated antibody that specifically binds hTNFalpha may, however, have cross-reactivity to other antigens, such as hTNFalpha molecules from other species. Moreover, an isolated antibody may be substantially free of other cellular material and/or chemicals.<br>
The term "human TNFalpha" (abbreviated herein as hTNFalpha, or simply hTNF), as used herein, is intended to refer to a human cytokine that exists as a 17 kDa secreted form and a 26 kDa membrane-associated form, the biologically active form of which is composed of a trimer of noncovalently bound molecules. The structure of hTNFalpha is described further in, for example, Pennica, D., et al. (1984) Nature 312:724-729: Davis, J.M., et al. (1987) Biochemistry 26:1322-1326; and Jones, E.Y., et al. (1989) Nature 338:225-228. The term human TNFalpha is intended to include recombinant human TNFalpha (rhTNFalpha), which can be prepared by standard recombinant expression methods or purchased commercially (R &amp; D Systems, Catalog No. 210-TA, Minneapolis, MN).<br>
The term "koff", as used herein, is intended to refer to the off rate constant for dissociation of an antibody from the antibody/antigen complex.<br>
The term "K^", as used herein, is intended to refer to the dissociation constant of a particular antibody-antigen interaction.<br>
A "functional equivalent" of a specific "parent" anti-hTNFalpha antibody as crystallized according to the invention is one which shows the same antigen-specificity, differs however with respect to the molecular composition of the "parenf antibody on the<br>
amino acid level or glycosylation level. Said differences, however, may be merely such that the crystallization conditions do not deviate from the parameter ranges as disclosed herein.<br>
"Encapsulation" of antibody crystals refers to a formulation where the incorporated crystals are individually coated by at least one layer of a coating material. In a preferred embodiment, such coated crystals may have a sustained dissolution rate.<br>
"Embedding" of antibody crystals refers to a formulation where the crystals, which might be encapsulated or not, are incorporated into a solid, liquid or semi-solid carrier in a disperse manner. Such embedded crystallized antibody molecules may be released or dissolved in a controlled, sustained manner from the carrier.<br>
B. Method of crystallization<br>
The crystallization method of the invention is in principle applicable to any anti-hTNFalpha antibody. Said antibody may be a polyclonal antibody or, preferably, a monoclonal antibody. Said antibody may be chimeric antibodies, humanized antibodies, human antibodies or non-human, as for example mouse antibodies, each in glyco-sylated or non-glycosylated form. In particular the method is applicable to D2E7 and functional equivalents thereof.<br>
Preferably said anti-hTNFalpha antibody is an IgG antibody, in particular an anti human TNFalpha antibody of the group lgG1.<br>
Unless otherwise stated the crystallization method of the invention makes use of technical equipment, chemicals and methodologies well known in the art. However, as explained above, the present invention is based on the surprising finding that the selection of specific crystallization conditions, in particular, the selection of specific crystallization agents, optionally further combined with specific pH conditions and/or concentration ranges of the corresponding agents (buffer, antibody, crystallization agent), allows for the first time to prepare reproducibly and in a large scale stable crystals of antibodies, in particular non-chimeric, human antibodies, directed against hTNF alpha, which can be further processed to form an active ingredient of a superior, highly advantageous pharmaceutical composition.<br>
The starting material for performing the crystallization method normally comprises a concentrated solution of the antibody to be crystallized. The protein concentration may, for example, be in the range of about 5 to 75 mg/ml. Said solution may contain additives stabilizing said dissolved antibody, and it may be advisable to remove said additives in advance. This can be achieved by performing a buffer exchange step.<br>
Preferably said starting material for performing the crystallization contains the antibody in an aqueous solution, having a pH adjusted in the range of about 3.2 to 8.2, or about 4.0 to 8.0, in particular about 4.5 to 6.5, preferably around 5.0 to 5.5. The pH may be adjusted by means of a suitable buffer applied in a final concentration of about 1 to 50 mM, in particular about 1 to 10 mM. The solution may contain additives, as for example in a proportion of about 0.01 to 15, or 0.1 to 5, or 0.1 to 2 wt.-% based on the total weight of the solution, like salts, sugars, sugar alcohols and surfactants, in order to further stabilize the solution. The excipients should preferably be selected from physiologically acceptable compounds, routinely applied in pharmaceutical preparations. As non-limiting examples there may be mentioned salts, like NaCI;; surfactants, like poly-sorbate 80 (Tween 80), polysorbate 20 (Tween 20); sugars, like sucrose, trehalose; sugar alcohols, like mannitol, sorbitol; and buffer agents, like phosphate-based buffer systems, as sodium and potassium hydrogen phosphate buffers as defined above, acetate buffer, phosphate buffer, citrate buffer, TRIS buffer, maleate buffer or succinate buffer, histidine buffer; amino acids, like histidine, arginine and glycine.<br>
The buffer exchange may be performed by means of routine methods, for example dialysis or ultrafiltration.<br>
The initial protein concentration of the aqueous solution used as starting material should be in the range of about 0.5 to about 200 or about 1 to about 50 mg/ml.<br>
Depending on the intended final batch size (which may be in the range of 1 ml to 20000 (twenty thousand) litres) an initial volume of said aqueous antibody solution is placed in an appropriate container (as for example a vessel, bottle or tank) made of inert material, as for example glass, polymer or metal. The initial volume of said aqueous solution may correspond to about 30 to 80%, normally about 50% of the final batch size.<br>
If necessary the solution after having been filled into said container will be brought to standardized conditions. In particular, the temperature will be adjusted in the range of about 4 °C and about 37 °C.<br>
Then the crystallization solution, containing the crystallization agent in an appropriate concentration, optionally pre-conditioned in the same way as the antibody solution, is added to the antibody solution.<br>
The addition of the crystallization solution is performed continuously or discontinuously optionally under gentle agitation in order to facilitate mixing of the two liquids. Preferably the addition is performed under conditions where the protein solution is provided under agitation and the crystallization solution (or agents in its solid from) is / are added in a controlled manner.<br>
The formation of the antibody crystals is initiated by applying a phosphate salt, in particular a hydrogen phosphate salt, and preferably an alkali metal salt, or a mixture of at least two different alkali metal salts as defined above as the crystallization agent. The crystallization solution contains the agent in a concentration which is sufficient to afford a final concentration of the phosphate salt in said crystallization mixture in the range of about 1 to 6 M.<br>
Preferably, the crystallization solution additionally contains an acidic buffer, i.e. different from that of the antibody solution, in a concentration suitable to allow the adjustment of the pH of the crystallization mixture in the range of about 3 to 5.<br>
After having finished the addition of said crystallization solution, the thus obtained mixture may be further incubated for about 1 hour to about 60 days in order to obtain a maximum yield of antibody crystals. If appropriate, the mixture may, for example, be agitated, gently stirred, rolled or moved in a manner known per se.<br>
Finally, the crystals obtained may be separated by known methods, for example filtration or centrifugation, as for example by centrifugation at about 200 - 20000 rpm, preferably 500 - 2000 rpm, at room temperature or 4°C. The remaining mother liquor may be discarded or further processed.<br>
If necessary, the thus isolated crystals may be washed and subsequently dried, or the mother liquor can be exchanged by a different solvent system suitable for storage and /or final use of the antibodies suspended therein.<br>
Antibody crystals formed according to the present invention may vary in their shape. Shapes typically may include needles, cone-like, spherical and sea urchin like shapes. The size of the crystals can be on the order of higher nm to mm size (as for example length). In some embodiments, the crystals are at least about 10 urn in size, and may be visible to the naked eye. For therapeutic administration, the size of the crystals will vary depending on the route of administration, for example, for subcutaneous administration the size of the crystals may be larger than for intravenous administration.<br>
The shape of the crystals may be altered by adding specific additional additives to the crystallization mixture, as has been previously described for both protein crystals and crystals of low molecular weight organic and inorganic molecules.<br>
If necessary, it may be verified that the crystals are in fact crystals of said antibody. Crystals of an antibody can be analyzed microscopically for birefringence. In general, crystals, unless of cubic internal symmetry, will rotate the plane of polarization of polarized light. In yet another method, crystals can be isolated, washed, resolubilized and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and, optionally, stained with an anti-Fc receptor antibody. Optionally, the resolubilized antibody can also be tested for binding to its hTNFalpha utilizing standard assays.<br>
Crystals as obtained according to the invention may also be crosslinked to one another. Such crosslinking may enhance stability of the crystals. Methods for crosslinking crystals described, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 5,849,296. Crystals can be crosslinked using a bifunctional reagent such as glutaraldehyde. Once crosslinked, crystals can be lyophilized and stored for use, for example, in diagnostic or therapeutic applications.<br>
In some cases, it may be desirable to dry the crystal. Crystals may be dried by means of inert gases, like nitrogen gas, vacuum oven drying, lyophilization, evaporation, tray drying, fluid bed drying, spray drying, vacuum drying or roller drying. Suitable methods are well known.<br>
Crystals formed according to the invention can be maintained in the original crystallization solution, or they can be washed and combined with other substances, like inert carriers or ingredients to form compositions or formulations comprising crystals of the invention. Such compositions or formulations can be used, for example, in therapeutic and diagnostic applications.<br>
A preferred embodiment is to combine a suitable carrier or ingredient with crystals of the invention in that way that crystals of the formulation are embedded or encapsulated by an excipient. Suitable carriers may be taken from the non limiting group of: poly (acrylic acid), poly (cyanoacrylates), poly (amino acids), poly (anhydrides), poly (dep-sipeptide), poly (esters), poly (lactic acid), poly (lactic-cc-glycolic acid) or PLGA, poly (3-hydroxybutryate), poly (caprolactone), poly (dioxanone); poly (ethylene glycol), poly (hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide, poly (organo) phosphazene, poly (ortho esters), poly (vinyl alcohol), poly (vinylpyrrolidone), maleic anhydride alkyl vinyl ether copolymers, pluronic polyols, albumin, alginate, cellulose and cellulose derivatives, collagen, fibrin, gelatin, hyaluronic acid, oligosaccharides, glycaminoglycans, sulfated polysaccharides, blends and copolymers thereof, SAIB, fatty acids and salts of fatty acids, fatty alcohols, fatty amines, mono-, di-, and triglycerides of fatty acids, phospholipids, glycolipids, sterols and waxes and related similar substances. Waxes are further classified in natural and synthetic products. Natural materials include waxes obtained from vegetable, animal or minerals sources such as beeswax, carnauba or montanwax. Chlorinated naphthalenes and ethylenic polymers are examples for synthetic wax products.<br>

Formulations described herein also comprise an effective amount of crystalline antibody. In particular, the formulations of the invention may include a "therapeutically effective amount" or a "prophylactically effective amount" of antibody crystals of the invention. A "therapeutically effective amount" refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired therapeutic result. A "therapeutically effective amount" of the antibody crystals may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the individual, and the ability of the antibody to elicit a desired response in the individual. A therapeutically effective amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the antibody are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects. A "prophylactically effective amount" refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired prophylactic result. Typically, since a prophylactic dose is used in subjects prior to or at an earlier stage of disease, the prophylactically effective amount will be less than the therapeutically effective amount.<br>
Suitable dosages can readily be determined using standard methodology. The antibody is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments. Depending on the above mentioned factors, about 1 ug/kg to about 50 mg/kg , as for ex-<br>
ample 0.1-20 mg/kg of antibody is an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient, whether, for example, by one or more separate administrations, or by continuous infusion. A typical daily or weekly dosage might range from about 1 ug/kg to about 20 mg/kg or more, depending on the condition, the treatment is repeated until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. However, other dosage regimens may be useful. In some cases, formulations comprise a concentration of antibody of at least about 1 g/L or greater when resolubilized. In other embodiments, the antibody concentration is at least about 1 g/L to about 100 g/L when resolubilized.<br>
Crystals of an antibody, or formulations comprising such crystals, may be administered alone or as part of a pharmaceutical preparation. They may be administered by par-enteral, oral or topical routes. For example, they may be administered by oral, pulmonary, nasal, aural, anal, dermal, ocular, intravenous, intramuscular, intraarterial, intrap-eritoneal, mucosal, sublingual, subcutaneous, transdermal, topical or intracranial routes, or into the buccal cavity. Specific examples of administration techniques comprise pulmonary inhalation, intralesional application, needle injection, dry powder inhalation, skin electroporation, aerosol delivery, and needle-free injection technologies, including needle-free subcutaneous administration.<br>
The present invention will now be explained in more detail by means of the following, non-limiting, illustrative examples. Guided by the general part of the description and on the basis of his general knowledge a skilled reader will be enabled to provide further embodiments to the invention without undue experimentation.<br>
Experimental Part A. Materials<br>
a)	Protein<br>
Frozen monoclonal antibody (mAb) D2E7 was obtained from Abbott Laboratories. All experiments were performed from a drug product lot where the original mAb concentration was 50 mg/ml.<br>
b)	Fine chemicals<br>
Sodium acetate was obtained from Grossing GmbH, Filsum. Polyethylenegfycols of different polymerization grades were obtained from Clariant GmbH, Sulzbach. Furthermore, commercial crystallization screens and reagents (Hampton Research, Nextal Biotechnologies) were used for certain microscale experiments. All other chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, or Merck, Darmstadt.<br>
B. General methods<br>
a)	Thawing of D2E7 drug substance<br>
D2E7 was thawed at 25 °C in agitated water baths.<br>
b)	Buffer exchange - method A<br>
An aliquot of D2E7 solution was pipetted into a 30 KDa MWCO Vivaspin 20 concentrator (Vivascience). The protein sample was diluted with the new buffer in a ratio of 1:10, and by centrrfugation at 5,000 x g at 4 °C (Sigma 4 K 15 lab centrifuge) the sample volume was brought back to the original sample volume. The dilution / centrifugation steps were repeated once, resulting in a dilution of 1:100 of the original sample buffer. After adjustment of protein concentration, the solution was sterile filtered through a 0.2 pm syringe driven filter unit.<br>
b)	Buffer exchange - method B<br>
An aliquot of D2E7 solution was placed into a SLIDE-A-LYZER dialysis cassette (Pierce Biotechnology Inc.). The dialysis cassette was placed into a beaker containing the buffer of choice, and the buffer exchange was performed at 4 °C overnight with stirring. After adjustment of protein concentration, the solution was sterile filtered through a 0.2 urn syringe driven filter unit.<br>
c)	OD280 - protein concentration measurements<br>
A ThermoSpectronics UV1 device was used to assess protein concentration at a wavelength of 280 nm, applying an extinction coefficient of 1.39 cm2 mg"1. For this purpose, aliquots of crystallization slurries were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm, and residual protein concentration was determined in the supernatant.<br>
d)	pH measurements<br>
pH measurements were conducted by using a Mettler Toledo MP220 pH meter. Inlab 413 electrodes and Inlab 423 microelectrodes were utilized.<br>
e) Crystallization methods<br>
e1) Microscale crystallization - Sitting drop vapor diffusion Hydra II Initial crystallization screens were performed using a Hydra II crystallization robot and Greiner 96 well plates (three drop wells, Hampton Research). After setting up the plates, the wells were sealed with Clearseal film (Hampton Research).<br>
e2) Microscale crystallization - Hanging drop vapor diffusion<br>
Hanging drop vapor diffusion experiments were conducted using VOX plates (with sealant, Hampton Research) and OptiClear plastic cover slides (squares, Hampton Research) or siliconized glass cover slides (circle, Hampton Research), respectively. After preparation of reservoir solutions, one drop of reservoir solution was admixed with one drop of the protein solution on a cover slide, and the well was sealed with the inverted cover slide in such a way that the drop was hanging above the reservoir.<br>
e3) Batch crystallization - method A (24 well plate)<br>
Batch crystallization was performed by admixing the protein solution with an equal amount of crystallization buffer (500 pi) in a well. The well was subsequently sealed with adhesive tape to prevent water evaporation.<br>
e4) Batch crystallization • method B (Eppendorff reaction tube)<br>
Batch crystallization was performed by admixing the protein solution with an equal<br>
amount of crystallization buffer in a 1.5 ml or a 2 mL Eppendorff reaction tube.<br>
e5) Batch crystallization - method C (Falcon tubes, agitation)<br>
Batch crystallization was performed by admixing the protein solution with an equal amount of crystallization buffer in a 50 mL Falcon tube. Right after closing, the tube was put on a laboratory shaker (GFL 3013 or GFL 3015) or was alternatively agitated by tumbling. By application of these methods, introduction of stirrers into the sample was avoided.<br>
e6) Batch crystallization - method D (1 liter polypropylene container)<br>
Batch crystallization was performed by admixing the protein solution with an equal amount of crystallization buffer in a sterilized 1 liter polypropylene bottle. Right after closing, the container was stored at ambient temperature without agitation. By application of this method, introduction of stirrers into the sample was avoided.<br>
f)	SDS-PAGE<br>
Samples were prepared by adjusting protein concentration to 8 ug / 20 uL The samples were diluted with an SDS / Tris / Glycerine buffer containing bromphenolblue.<br>
Qualitative SDS PAGE analysis was performed using Invitrogen NuPage 10% Bis-Tris Gels, NuPage MES SDS Running Buffer and Mark12 Wide Range Protein Standards. 20 uL of sample was pipetted into a gel pocket. After running the gel and fixation with acetic acid / methanol reagent, staining was performed using the Novex Colloidal Blue Stain Kit. Gels were dried using Invitogen Gel-Dry drying solution.<br>
g)	Light Microscopy<br>
Crystals were observed using a Zeiss Axiovert 25 or a Nikon Labophot microscope. The latter was equipped with a polarization filter set and a JVC TK C1380 color video camera.<br>
h) SE-HPLC<br>
Aggregation levels of D2E7 samples were assessed by SE-HPLC. A Dionex P680 pump, ASM 00 autosampler and UVD170U detector device were used. Aggregated species were separated from the monomer by an Amersham Bioscience Superose 6 10/300 GL gel filtration column, applying a validated Abbott standard protocol (CL16-PS-02, Adalimumab purity).<br>

Discussion of results of vapor diffusion crystallization experiments:<br>
Crystallization experiments were initially performed using a well-described micro scale methodology. Since a PEG 4,000 / sodium acetate buffer condition was described as a promising crystallization condition by other inventors who were working with different antibodies of different antigen specificity or origin, it was decided to start with these agents. It was found after extensive experimentation that PEG 4,000 in an acetate buffer did not provide crystals, at least at investigated combinations of factors influencing crystallization (protein concentration, precipitating agent concentration, buffer ionic strength and pH, temperature), and thus it was decided to continue with broad crystallization screens, thereby introducing a wide variety of chemicals into the screening process. Finally, it was surprisingly found that sodium dihydrogen phosphate in acetate buffer is a powerful crystallization agent for D2E7, which does not introduce any toxic reagent unacceptable from a pharmaceutical point of view.<br>

D2E7 was brought to a concentration of around 10 mg/mL by dilution with Milli Q water.<br>
Batch crystallization was performed by admixing around 500 uL of the protein solution with an equal amount of crystallization solution in well of a 24 well plate. 500 uL of a particular crystallization solution was prepared by admixing acetate buffer, sodium dihydrogen phosphate stock solution, potassium dihydrogen phosphate stock solution and Milli Q water in a well.

Example 36 - Sodium potassium dihydrogen phosphate / sodium acetate grid screen batch crystallization at 1 mL batch volume<br>
D2E7 was buffered into a 20 mM HEPES /150 mM sodium chloride buffer at pH 7.4. The protein concentration was adjusted to 10 mg/mL.<br>
Batch crystallization was performed by admixing around 500 pL of the protein solution with an equal amount of crystallization solution in well of a 24 well plate. 500 uL of a<br>
particular crystallization solution was prepared by admixing acetate buffer, sodium di-hydrogen phosphate stock solution, potassium dihydrogen phosphate stock solution and Mill! Q water in a well. In this example, the acetate buffer molarity was 0.1 M, and the acetate buffer pH was around 4.1 or 4.6. The following combinations of sodium dihydrogen phosphate and potassium dihydrogen phosphate were applied:<br>
around 1.8 M sodium dihydrogen phosphate and around 0.8 M potassium dihydrogen phosphate,<br>
around 2.2 M sodium dihydrogen phosphate and around 0.6 M potassium dihydrogen phosphate,<br>
from around 2.6 M sodium dihydrogen phosphate to around 4.4 M sodium dihydrogen phosphate in 0.2 M steps without the potassium salt, respectively.<br>

Furthermore, the crystal yield of three batches was determined by OD280. An aliquot of the suspension was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm, and the protein concentration in the supernatant was assessed.<br>
RESULTS: Needle cluster like crystals were found in the following eight batches:<br>
acetate buffer pH 4.1 and sodium dihydrogen phosphate molarity of around 3.6 M to around 4.4 M (in 0.2 M steps),<br>

Precipitated species were obviously present in these batches immediately after combining the protein solution and the crystallization solution (milky suspension, typical light microscopic picture). As no precipitated species were observed after five days, it<br>
was concluded that formerly precipitated species rearranged into crystalline species. The protein is highly supersaturated in the crystallization mixture, and protein precipitates immediately. Some protein may still be dissolved, now either only slightly supersaturated or perhaps even below saturation. Crystals form, thereby further lowering the concentration of dissolved protein. Furthermore, the precipitated species clearly redis-solve over time and are incorporated into the growing crystals.<br>

Batch crystallization was performed by admixing around 50 mL of protein solution with an equal amount of crystallization solution in a clean 1 L polypropylene bottle. 50 mL of the crystallization solution was prepared by admixing acetate buffer, sodium dihydrogen phosphate stock solution and Milli Q water in the tube. In this example, the acetate buffer molarity was 0.1 M, and the acetate buffer pH was around 4.1. Sodium dihydrogen phosphate molarity was 4.2 M. The container was stored at ambient temperature. Microscopy of a 1 uL aliquot of the solution was performed multiple times during the following month.<br>
RESULTS: Needle cluster like crystals were observed after seven days. The crystal yield as determined by OD280 from residual protein concentration in the supernatant was above 95% after seven days.<br>
Precipitated species were present in this batch immediately after combining the protein solution and the crystallization solution (milky suspension, typical light microscopic picture). Since no precipitated species were observed after seven days, it was concluded that a phase transition occurred where formerly precipitated species rearranged into crystalline species.<br>
Example 41 b - Sodium dihydrogen phosphate / sodium acetate batch crystallization at 1 mL, 50 ml and 10 L batch volume, No agitation<br>
Large-scale crystallization of D2E7 was also performed by combining 1 L of 50 mg/mL D2E7 in Adalimumab commercial buffer formulation pH 5.2 (see Example 35) and 4 L water for injection (WFI) in a 10 L polypropylene vessel (Nalgene®). The solution was homogenized by gentle shaking. This 5 L D2E7 solution (10 mg/mL) was then mixed with 5 L of precipitating agent solution (5 M sodium dihydrogen phosphate, 4,400 ml, 1 M sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.1, 500 mL, WFI (Ampuwa), 100 mL) The precipitating agent solution was added in 500 mL portions. After addition of each portion the solution was homogenized by gently rotating/inverting the bottle. After addition of around 2,500 to -3,000 mL of the precipitating agent solution, a white precipitate appeared. The remaining precipitating agent was added all at once. Then the crystal preparation was homogenized (gently rotating/inverting) again.<br>
Immediately after batch manufacture (i.e. after admixing of 5 L D2E7 solution and 5 L precipitating agent), 1 mL (filled into low volume Eppendorf sample vials) and 50 mL aliquots (filled into 50 mL Falcon sample tubes) were pulled and stored adjacent to the 10 L vessel for control and for evaluation of the impact of batch size on D2E7 crystallization. As outlined by Figs. 2 to 4, the batch volume (i.e. 1 mL, 50 mL and 10 L, respectively) had no impact on D2E7 crystal needle/needle cluster size.<br>
Discussion of results of batch crystallization experiments:<br>
As the applied micro scale technique (see Section 0. supra) is not feasible for large scale production of protein crystals, the crystallization conditions discovered by these micro scale methods were transferred into a scaleable batch mode.<br>
D2E7 was successfully crystallized at 100 mL batch volume with ultimately high yield (&gt; 95%) and reproducibility, indicating that this crystallization system is applicable for industrial processing. By SDS-PAGE analysis, the protein character of the crystals was proven. SE-HPLC analysis of redissolved crystals showed only a slight increase in ag-<br>
 <br>
gregated species. Washing of the crystals was possible by using an acetate buffer containing sodium dihydrogen phosphate around 4.2M sodium dihydrogen phosphate in around 0.1 M sodium acetate at a pH around 4.1. No measurable solubility of D2E7 crystals in such a washing buffer occurs, as analyzed by OD280, recovering more than 90% of the crystals.<br>
The experimental conditions of the above batch experiments are summarized in the following Table 1:<br>
(Table  Removed)  <br>
E.	Methods for crystal processing and analysis<br>
Example 42 - Washing of crystals<br>
After formation of the crystals, a washing step without redissolving the crystals is favourable. Therefore, after the crystallization process was finished, the crystal slurry was transferred into a centrifugation tube and centrifuged at 500 to 1000 x g for twenty minutes. The centrifugation was performed at 4 °C, but might also be performed at other feasible temperatures, e.g. room temperature. After centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded, and the crystal pellet was resuspended in a buffer containing around 4.2 M sodium dihydrogen phosphate in around 0.1 M sodium acetate at a pH around 4.1. No measurable solubility of D2E7 crystals in the washing buffer occured, as analyzed by OD280. The centrifugation / resuspension steps were subsequently repeated for one to three times, and after this washing procedure, the pellet was re-suspended and stored in a buffer containing around 4.2 M sodium dihydrogen phosphate in around 0.1 M sodium acetate at a pH around 4.1.<br>
Example 43 - Analysis of crystals by SDS-PAGE<br>
To prove the protein character of the crystals, the crystals were washed with a washing buffer as described in example 42. After assuring by OD280 that no more dissolved protein was present in the supernatant after centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded, and the crystals were subsequently dissolved in distilled water. OD280 measurement of this solution revealed that the crystals essentially consisted of protein, as the absorbance of the sample was now significantly higher as in the residual washing buffer. SDS-PAGE analysis of this solution of redissolved crystals, when compared to an original D2E7 sample, showed the same pattern.<br>
F.	Miscellaneous Examples<br>
Concentration values given in the following examples are initial values referring to the antibody solution and the crystallization solution before mixing of the two solutions.<br>
All pH values, if not described otherwise, refer to the pH of an acetate buffer stock before it was combined with other substances, like the crystallization agent.<br>
All buffer molarities, if not described otherwise, refer to sodium acetate concentrations in a stock solution before pH adjustment, typically performed using acetic acid glacial.<br>
Example 44 - Solid crystallization agent<br>
D2E7 was used without exchanging the buffer (see Example 35).<br>
D2E7 was brought to a concentration of around 10 mg/mL by diluting the liquid with Mill! Q water.<br>
Batch crystallization was performed by admixing around 500 pL of the protein solution with an equal amount of acetate buffer (0.1 M, pH 4.1 or 4.6, respectively) in a well of a 24 well plate. Subsequently, solid sodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate was added at six different ratios to each pH setting: around 0.23g, 0.27g, 0.30g, 0.33g, 0.36g and 0.39g. Thus, after complete dissolution of the crystallization agent, the concentration was around 1.5M to 2.5M in 0.2M steps. The wells were subsequently sealed and the plate was agitated on a laboratory shaker until complete dissolution of the crystallization agent. Thereafter, the 24 well plate was stored at ambient temperature without agitation. Microscopy of the plate was performed after five days.<br>
RESULTS: Needle cluster-like crystals were found in the following seven batches:<br>
acetate buffer pH 4.1 and sodium dihydrogen phosphate molarity of around 2.1 M, 2.3M and 2.5M, respectively.<br>
acetate buffer pH 4.6 and sodium dihydrogen phosphate molarity of around 1.9M, 2.1 M, 2.3M and 2.5M, respectively.<br>
Example 45 - Different buffer preparation protocol and preparation of crystals<br>
In this example, the acetate buffers were prepared as described in the following: 3 g of acetic acid glacial were diluted with around 42 mL of purified water. The pH was ad-<br>
 <br>
justed with sodium hydroxide solution and the volume adjusted to 50 ml_. In this case, the total acetate amount is fixed at 1M (100 mM in the crystallization solution, or 50 mM in the crystallization mixture) and not expanded by pH adjustment.<br>
D2E7 was used without exchanging the buffer (see Example 35).<br>
D2E7 was brought to a concentration of around 10 mg/mL by diluting the liquid with Milli Q water.<br>
Batch crystallization was performed by admixing around 500 uL of the protein solution with an equal amount of crystallization solution in well of a 24 well plate. 500 uL of a particular crystallization solution was prepared by admixing acetate buffer, sodium di-hydrogen phosphate stock solution, potassium dihydrogen phosphate stock solution and Milli Q water in a well. In this example, the acetate buffer molarity was 0.1 M, and the acetate buffer pH was around 4.1 and 4.6, respectively. Sodium dihydrogen phosphate molarity was varied from around 3.4 M to around 4.4 M in 0.2 M steps. The wells were subsequently sealed after preparation of the crystallization mixture to prevent water evaporation. Microscopy of the plate was performed after five days.<br>
RESULTS: Needle cluster-like crystals were found in the following nine batches:<br>
acetate buffer pH 4.1 and sodium dihydrogen phosphate molarity of around 3.6 to 4.4, in 0.2 steps.<br>
acetate buffer pH 4.6 and sodium dihydrogen phosphate molarity of around 3.6 to 4.2, in 0.2 steps.<br>
Example 46 - Preparation of encapsulated crystals<br>
Crystals as obtained in example 41 are positively charged as determined via zeta potential measurement using a Malvern Instruments Zetasizer nano.<br>
The crystals are washed and suspended in a buffer containing excipients which conserve crystallinity, and which has a pH that keeps the crystals charged. Subsequently, an appropriate encapsulating agent is added to the crystal suspension. In this context,<br>
 <br>
an appropriate encapsulating agent is a (polymeric) substance with low toxicity, biode-gradability and counter ionic character. Due to this counter ionic character, the substance is attracted to the crystals and allows coating. By this technique, the dissolution of crystals in media which do not contain any other excipient maintaining crystallinity is preferably sustained.<br>
Example 47 - Preparation of encapsulated / embedded crystals<br>
Crystals are obtained as described in example 41.<br>
The crystals are washed and suspended in a buffer containing excipients which conserve crystallinity. The crystals can then be<br>
embedded by drying the crystals and combining these dried crystals with a carrier, e.g. by compression, melt dispersion, etc.<br>
encapsulated / embedded by combining a crystal suspension with a carrier solution which is not miscible with water. The carrier precipitates after removal of the solvent of the carrier. Subsequently, the material is dried, encapsulated / embedded by combining a crystal suspension with a water miscible carrier solution. The carrier precipitates as its solubility limit is exceeded in the mixture.<br>
embedded by combining dried crystals or a crystal suspension with a water miscible carrier solution.<br>
embedded by combining dried crystals with a carrier solution which is not water miscible.<br>
G.     Crystal characterization<br>
In the following section experiments that were performed to determine whether crystalline monoclonal antibody D2E7 retains the bioactivity characteristic of never-crystallized D2E7 upon redissolution of the crystalline material are summarized.<br>
G1.   Bioactivity test with murine L-929 cells<br>
a) General method<br>
The neutralizing effect of D2E7 solution against the cytotoxic effect of recombinant human TNF (rHuTNF) was determined. This involved incubating mouse L-929 cells as indicator in a 96-well microtiter plate in the presence of various D2E7 concentrations for 48 hours with a defined amount of rHuTNF at 37 °C. The surviving cells were stained with crystal violet. The intensity of color was measured by spectrophotometry in the individual wells of the microtiter plate and evaluated. The ICso was measured, i.e. the concentration of D2E7 which reduced the cytotoxic effect of rHuTNF on L-929 cells such that 50% of the cells survived.<br>
In a separate dilution box, starting from the 1 ug protein/mL dilutions, the 9 titer curve measuring points (curve dilutions) were prepared individually in the dilution tubes for sample and reference standard.<br>
The L-929 cell suspension to be used was diluted with medium to provide a concentration of 60,000 cells/mL. Subsequently 100 uL per well of the respective cell concentration were pipetted into columns 1 -11 of the test plate. The wells in column 12 contained only 100 uL of medium each. Incubation was applied at 37 °C and 5% (v/v) CO2 for 24 hours in the test plate.<br>
After 24 hours' incubation, 50 uL of each of the 9 titer curve dilutions were transferred from the dilution box to the test plate for the reference standard or sample, i.e. for the reference standard to wells in rows A - D in columns 1 - 9 and for the sample to the wells in rows E - H in columns 1 to 9.<br>
50 uL of medium were pipetted into column 10; and 100 pL each were pipetted into columns 11 and 12.<br>
50 ML of TNF reference standard (12.5 ng protein/mL medium) were pipetted into the wells in column 1 to 10, row A to H, whereby column 10 corresponded to the 100% lysis value (TNF control).<br>
Column 11 was a 100% growth control, and column 12 contained no cell material and thus acted as a blank. The final volume per well was 200 uL.<br>
Incubation of the test plates was performed for 48 hours at 37 °C and with 5% CO2. Following incubation for 2 days, the liquids from the test plate wells were discarded by turning quickly and giving a single, vigorous downward shake. Then 50 uL of crystal violet solution (0.75% crystal violet, 0.35% sodium chloride, 32.4% ethanol and 8.6% formaldehyde) were pipetted into each well. The solution was left in the wells for 15 minutes and then discarded as described above. Then the plates were washed and dried at room temperature for about 30 minutes. Subsequently, 100 uL of reagent solution (50% ethanol and 0.1% acetic acid) were pipetted into each well. Agitation of the plates (at about 300 rpm for 15 min) produced an evenly colored solution in each of the wells.<br>
The absorbance of the dye in the test plate wells was measured in a plate photometer at 620 nm. Individual values were plotted on a graph, with the absorbance (y axis) being plotted against the respective dilution or concentration ng/mL (x axis) of antibody. From the 4-parameter plot, the concentration was read off at which half the cells survive and half die (ICso value). This concentration was calculated by parameter 3 of the 4-parameter function of the curve data. The mean values of the reference standard concentrations were calculated. The relative biological activity of the sample was calculated by dividing the mean ICso value of the reference standard by the individual \CX values of the sample and multiplication by 100%. The relative activities were then averaged.<br>
b) Relative activity for D2E7 Crystals<br>
The test was performed as a comparison of the biological activity of the sample to that of a reference standard. The absorption values, plotted versus the concentration of D2E7 and assessed by a 4-parameter nonlinear regression, revealed the ICso values for the inhibition of the TNF effect by the antibody. Since both samples were run in four repeats on one microplate this results in four ICso values for D2E7 reference standard and sample respectively. Subsequently, the mean of the ICso values of the reference standard was calculated and the relative activity of each repeat of the sample was assessed by dividing the mean ICso value of the reference standard by the relevant value of the sample and multiplication by 100%.<br>
The test of the sample (crystal suspension 2.7 mg/mL, prepared as described in Example 36) revealed a relative biological activity of 111 %.<br>
Thus, the sample can be considered as fully biologically active.<br>
G2.    Microscopic characterization<br>
In the following, data on microscopic characterization of crystals of D2E7 will be presented.<br>
a)	Optical analysis of mAb crystal batch samples<br>
After homogenization, aliquots of 1 to 10 uL sample volume were pipetted onto an object holder plate and were covered with a glass cover slide. The crystal preparations were assessed using a Zeiss Axiovert 25 inverted light microscope equipped with E-PI 10x oculars and 10x, 20x and 40x objectives, respectively. Pictures were taken using a digital camera (Sony Cybershot DSC S75).<br>
b)	Optical analysis of vapor diffusion experiments, assessment of approximate crystal<br>
sizes and detection of birefringence<br>
For this purpose, a Nikon Labophot microscope was used, equipped with CFW 10x oculars and 4x, 10x, 20x and 40x objectives, respectively.<br>
For assessment of vapor diffusion experiments, the sample drops in the 24 well plates were screened.<br>
Crystal sizes were assessed by transferring the microscopic picture onto a computer screen by means of a JVC TK C1380 color video camera, and by measuring the length or diameter of representative needle-like or needle cluster-like crystals, applying the JVC Digital Screen Measurement Comet software version 3.52a. Furthermore, the microscope was equipped with a filter set (polarizer and analyzer) to assess the birefrin-gent behaviour of samples.<br>
If the polarization directions of the polarizer and analyzer filters are set at a 90° angle relative to each other ("crossed polarizers"), no light will pass through to the micro-<br>
scope eyepiece; the image will appear dark or black. If now a sample, which is placed into the light beam between the crossed polarizers, is capable of rotating the polarization plane of the light, a distinct glimmering of the sample against a dark background will be observed. This behaviour, termed "birefringence", distinguishes ordered crystalline (anisotropic) from unordered amorphous (isotropic) matter. As birefringence is characteristic for anisotropic matter, this glimmering appearance proves the existence of crystalline matter. However, the absence of birefringence does not exclude the existence of crystalline matter, as the crystals might also exhibit cubic symmetry and therefore be isotropic, like amorphous matter.<br>
c) Results<br>
In the attached Figures 1 to 4 representative pictures of D2E7 crystals are presented.<br>
Figure 1 shows D2E7 crystals obtained by small-scale batch crystallization according to Example 37 after 6 days at room temperature (5 mg/ml final protein concentration; Crystallization buffer: 4.2 M sodium dihydrogen phosphate in 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 4.1). The crystals exhibited birefringence.<br>
Figures 2 to 4 show D2E7 crystals obtained by large-scale batch crystallization according to Example 41 b.<br>
Syringeability: A D2E7 crystal suspension 200 mg/mL protein incorporated in crystals and formulated in a buffer containing 20% (m/v) PEG 4,000 is syringeable through a 27 Vfe G needle.<br>
G3.   Birefringence<br>
In order to demonstrate that Adalimumab crystallization in fact provides crystalline material its birefringence was analyzed.<br>
Protein: Diluted 70 mg/ml Adalimumab in formulation buffer with double-distilled water to 10mg/ml.<br>
Precipitant: 4 M NaH2PO4 (dissolved powder in double-distilled water)<br>
Method: Micro batch crystallization in a hanging-drop tray with 2 ml compartment well, Mixed 500 ul protein solution with 500 ul protein; no NaOAc in the solution.<br>
Temperature:    24 °C.<br>
Technical Equipment for birefringence measurement: Nikon SMZ1500 stereo dissecting microscope equipped with a Nikon CoolPix CCD camera. Crystal birefringence was photographed under crossed polarizers. Magnification is approximately 200x.<br>
Corresponding micrographs are shown in Figure 5 A. A marked birefringence of the clusters of Adalimumab needle-like crystals is observed. The colour of the crystals changes from blue to red, then back to blue, as the orientation of the crystal needle axis rotates relative to the light polarization direction.<br>
A further set of micrographs is depicted in Figures 5 B, C and D.<br>
All images were taken with a Nikon Eclipse E600 POL microscope and a Nikon DXM 1200 digital camera. Magnification is approximately 40x.<br>
The image of Figure 5B (grey) is taken with plane polars and shows the particle morphology. The white crystals on the black background (Figure 5D) show birefringence and were taken with crossed polars. The blue and orange crystals on the purple background (Figure 5C) show birefringence and were taken with crossed polar and a red compensator or quarter wave plate.<br>
H. Crystal Syringeability<br>

The results (Figure 6) suggest that higher gauge needles provide a slower delivery of the crystals at at high concentrations.<br>
I.      Stability data (SE HPLC, FT-IR)<br>
In the following section, experiments were performed to determine the stability of crystalline suspensions of monoclonal antibody D2E7 (50 and 200 mg/ml) over 12 month storage at 2-8°C.<br>

(Table  Removed)  <br>
A Dionex HPLC system (P680 pump, AS1100 autosampler, UVD170U) was used for stability anaysis by SEC. D2E7 samples were separated on a GE Superose* 6 column, applying a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. UV quantitation (detection) was performed at a wavelength of 214 nm. The running buffer consisted of 0.15M sodium chloride in 0.02M sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.5. IR spectra were recorded with a Confocheck system on a Bruker Optics Tensor 27. Liquid samples were analyzed using a MicroBio-lytics AquaSpec cell. Each sample was assessed performing at least two measurements of 120 to 500 scans at 25°C. Blank buffer spectra were subtracted from the protein spectra, respectively. Protein second derivative spectra were generated by Fourier transformation and vector normalized from 1580-1720 cm"1 for relative comparison. Redissolution of crystals was performed as follows: Crystal suspensions were diluted with Humira*commercial buffer to 10 mg/mL protein concentration. By decreasing PEG concentration crystals redissolved.<br>
Blue - standard, Humira0 after freeze / thaw Red - redissolved crystals after 6 month storage at 25°C, 50 mg/mL<br>
Green - redissolved crystals after 6 month storage at 25°C, 200 mg/mL<br>
Results: Figure 7 illustrates that there were no conformational differences over 6 months of storage at 25°C<br>
J.     Morphology<br>
After 12 months of storage at 2-8°C no significant morphological changes were observed by light microscopy analysis of the crystals.<br>
