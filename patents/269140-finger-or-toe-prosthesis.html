				<td>Finger or toe prosthesis<br>
The invention relates to a finger or toe prosthesis having an intracorporeal<br>
implant and an external modular frame constituting the core of the finger or toe<br>
prosthesis with a certain number of modules or components, each with its own<br>
function, which will be assembled to constitute one modular frame which can be<br>
covered by an aesthetical or functional cover.<br>
The WO 03/017876 A1 discloses a drive device for a finger prosthesis of<br>
substantially natural size designed to bend the finger prosthesis about a shaft<br>
relative to a fixing, e.g. in a human or artificial metacarpus. The drive device<br>
comprises a motor which can be connected to an energy source, and a<br>
transmission intended to transform a force from the motor to the finger<br>
prosthesis to perform the movement.<br>
It is also known that by using an osseous integration technique and silicone<br>
cosmetic prosthesis serious phalangeal amputations can be treated. This<br>
technique consists in the insertion of a threaded titanium implant in,,the medullar<br>
canal of the bone structure in a finger, anchoring a silicone finger prosthesis to<br>
a skin-penetrating abutment and locking the prosthesis in place by a small<br>
transverse screw device. Such an osseous integrated silicone prosthesis has<br>
good cosmetic results but cannot replace the function of the lost bone structure<br>
completely.<br>
An object of the invention is to provide a finger or toe prosthesis which is more<br>
functional in use and which does have a more natural appearance.<br>
The object of the invention is achieved by a finger or toe prosthesis according to<br>
claim 1 wherein the external modular frame is displaceably fixed to the<br>
intracorporeal implant. Due to the displaceable fixing it is possible to bend the<br>
external modular frame or a part of the external modular frame relative to the<br>
intracorporeal implant to adapt the form of the prosthesis to actual<br><br>
requirements. Furthermore the displaceable fixing allows the external modular frame to move<br>
relatively to the intracorporeal implant upon an overload so that the stress to the intracorporeal<br>
implant or the bone structure can be limited.<br>
The external modular frame is mounted on a transcutaneous component of the implant so that a<br>
stable mechanical fixing can be achieved. Alternatively the external modular frame can be coupled to<br>
the transcutaneous component by means of a coupling component or interface. The external<br>
modular frame is positioned outside of the body and is anchored to the coupling component or<br>
interface. The coupling component can be a modular part of the modular frame fixed to it or it may<br>
be an integral part of the external modular frame. The external modular frame and the coupling<br>
component, as well as the transcutaneous component may constitute in part or in total an aesthetic<br>
finger prosthesis.<br>
The coupling component may be an elastic component or a part of a joint means, e. g. the proximal<br>
part of a hinge joint The coupling component may be constituted as a deformable component, e. g.<br>
a plastic device which recovers its shape after deformation.<br>
The external modular frame has a joint or bendable interface onto which an extension may be<br>
connected. By adaption of the length of the extension, e.g. with a modular setup of the extension,<br>
the position of the joint or bendable interface of the external modular frame can be brought to its<br>
ideal position. A joint, e. g. a simple hinge, can be used for a finger prosthesis with frequent flexion<br>
or extension movements, a bendable interface is preferably used for a prosthesis, which is displaced<br>
not so often or for single adjustment.<br>
The external modular frame is covered with a cosmetic or functional cover consisting of smooth<br>
material reversibly or-irreversibly fixed to the external modular frame. The external modular frame<br>
may be covered completely by the cover wherein the cover may be composed of various materials<br>
with various physical characteristics, e.g. (visco-)elasticity and plasticity, compressibility and<br>
nonlinear deformation behaviour, for supporting the underlying modular frame and to achieve a<br>
natural appearance in respect to wrinkling, elongation, shortening or buckling. The external modular<br>
frame and the cover may be designed to become one unit. The cover may be adapted to the specific<br>
frame and its design or function and support the frame in its function. The cover may be made of<br>
foam or silicone for supporting the function of the underlying external modular frame.<br>
Furthermore, the coupling component may be designed as an adhesive or as a snap joint.<br>
To avoid injuries or lesions the coupling component may contain a fail safety mechanism or overload<br>
protection device so that in the event of an overload, hyper-rotation or hyper-flexion the external<br>
modular frame and the intracorporeal part will be decoupled as to safeguard the bone structure of<br>
traumata.<br><br>
Should the coupling component not constitute part of the transcutaneous<br>
component or abutment, it may easily be removed with or not by means of<br>
using an accessory.<br>
The patient may also, if desired, cover the parts proximal to the coupling<br>
component or solely transcutaneous component avoiding visibility of metal<br>
elements when the finger epithesis is being removed or protecting, the<br>
transcutaneous component and adjacent tissue. This cover or protective cap<br>
may exert pressure to the skin or soft tissue or may be loaded with an agent for<br>
stimulating the skin or soft tissue. In addition the coupling component may also<br>
serve as an extension thus the level of amputation may be mitigated whereby a<br>
joint may be placed in an ideal position. Consequently, the coupling component<br>
can be adapted, e.g. by telescopic elements or production of various lengths.<br>
The intracorporeal implant is permanently connected to the bone structure of<br>
the stump. It may be a screwed implant, which will be introduced in a<br>
longitudinal manner into the remaining bone structure. Osseous integration will<br>
ensure a definitive anchoring of the implant, preferably made of titanium, into<br>
the bone structure. The transcutaneous component, an integral part of the<br>
implant, perforates the skin and offers the possibility of connecting the other<br>
structures.<br>
The material, of e. g. the coupling component or the cover, which gets into<br>
contact with the skin or soft tissue of the patient may be loaded with an agent<br>
released by the material and influencing the skin or soft tissue surrounding the<br>
transcutaneous component in a positive way, e.g. infection treatment.<br>
The coupling component may exercise pressure on the tissue surrounding the<br>
transcutaneous component to stimulate the soft tissue and to provide a<br>
feedback of the exerted pressure of the prosthesis.<br><br>
The fail safety mechanism may be a friction-type locking, e. g. a magnetic joint, or adhesive<br>
spring loaded form fit locking, a spring loaded hinge or a non-linear spring element.<br>
The bendable interface may be an elastic element, e. g. a metal wire, which is encircled by<br>
tube-typed device to allow internal sliding of the plastic-elastic element upon bending and<br>
adapting the location of bending joint by adjustment of the length of the tube type device.<br>
The tube-type device may be a spiral, which at its turn may be encircled by cylindrical<br>
components ensuring the location of possible flexion or extension.<br>
The external modular frame or the coupling component may be produced from metal or plastic<br>
promoting, limiting or eliminating the conduction of vibrations to the intracorporeal bone<br>
structure. The external modular frame or the coupling component can be designed as a<br>
dampening device for vibrations. Specific components of the external modular frame or the<br>
coupling component may also limit the conduction of heat or cold to the intracorporeal implant<br>
and bone structure by thermal insulation, e.g. plastic elements.<br><br>
The distal part of the external modular frame may have an extra-low hardness<br>
to promote larger surface-contact when getting in contact with objects. The<br>
functional or cosmetic cover may be loaded with agents leaving the cover and<br>
thus influencing the soft tissue surrounding the transcutaneous component.<br>
A fail safety mechanism for a finger or toe prosthesis may have an external<br>
modular frame which is coupled to the intracorporeal implant by a friction type<br>
locking, e.g. a magnetic joint, a form fit locking, a spring loaded hinge or a non-<br>
linear-spring allowing hyper-extension or hyper-flexion, ductile deformation or<br>
breaking at a predetermined load.<br>
Due to the modularity of the frame various functions, e.g. joints, coupling or fail-<br>
safety-components can be implemented and combined in an efficient and cost<br>
effective way, combined with the cover. Due to the joints or bending interfaces it<br>
is possible to adapt the form of the prosthesis to actual requirements.<br>
Furthermore, a faii-safety-mechanism allows the external modular frame to<br>
move relatively to the intracorporeal implant or to detach from the intracorporeal<br>
implant upon an overload so that the stress transferred by the external modular<br>
frame to the intracorporeal implant can be limited.<br><br>
The invention is illustrated by the accompanying drawings in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a schematic view of a finger prosthesis;<br>
Figure 2 shows a joint;<br>
Figure 3 shows a part of a joint according to figure 2;<br>
Figure 4 shows a first embodiment of a prosthesis;<br>
Figure 5 shows an alternative embodiment of the prosthesis;<br>
Figure 6 shows a prosthesis with a bendable interface;<br>
Figure 7 shows an example of a possible component configuration;<br>
Figure 8 shows a sectional view of a stump with an trancutaneous component and a cover<br>
or protective cap;<br>
Figure 9 shows an embodiment of an element of an aesthetic cover, modular frame or<br>
protective cap interacting with the skin and soft tissue of the stump; and<br>
Figure 10 shows an example for a prosthesis in situ.<br>
Referring to the drawings, figure 1 shows schematically a bone structure 1 surrounded by soft<br>
tissue 2 covered by a skin 10. Into the bone structure 1 an implant 3 is introduced in a<br>
longitudinal manner. The implant 3 may be screwed into the remaining bone structure 1.<br>
Osseous integration will ensure an anchoring of the implant 1. A transcutaneous component 4,<br>
defining an abutment, perforates the skin 10 and offers the possibility of connecting other<br>
structures to the implant 3 and the stump. The transcutaneous component or abutment 4 may<br>
be an integral part of the implant 3 or is removably fixed to the implant 3. This implant 3 and<br>
the proximal intracorporeal part of the transcutaneous component 4 constitute the intracorporal<br>
level.<br>
Onto the transcutaneous component 4 an extension as a coupling component 5 is removably<br>
fixed. The coupling component 5 is connected to or making part of the transcutaneous<br>
component 4. The coupling component 5 is the connection between the intracorporal level or<br>
intracorporal part and an extracorporal level of the trancutaneous component 4 and an external<br>
modular frame consisting of<br><br>
the coupling component 5, and joint 6 fixed to the coupling component 5 and extensions 5', 7,<br>
distaliy arranged to the joint 6.<br>
The connection between the transcutaneous component 4 and the external modular frame,<br>
consisting of the coupling component 5, the joint 6 and the extensions 5', 7 needs to be<br>
sufficiently stiff to support the finger in movement. On the other hand, the patient needs to be<br>
able to remove and connect the external modular frame 5, 6, 5', 7 as a finger epithesis in a<br>
relatively simple manner, whether or not by means of using an accessory. The design of the<br>
coupling component 5 or interface may also include a fail safety mechanism function. Thus, in<br>
the event of an overload or hyper-rotation, the external modular frame 5, 6, 5', 7 and the<br>
intracorporal parts 3, 4 will be decoupled as to safeguard the bone structure 1 of trauma.<br>
Should the coupling component 5 not constitute part of the abutment 4 it may easily be<br>
removed by the patient, whether or not by means of using an accessory. The patient may also,<br>
if desired, cover the transcutaneous component 4 avoiding visibility of metal elements and to<br>
•protect the transcutaneous component when the finger epithesis is being removed. In addition<br>
the coupling component 5 may also serve as an extension thus the level of the amputation may<br>
by mitigated whereby the joint 6 will be placed at an ideal position. Consequently, the coupling<br>
component 5 will be produced in various lengths.<br>
The external modular frame 5, 6, 5', 7 constitutes the extension of the bone structure 1 of the<br>
amputated finger. The frame is preferably composed of a light and strong material, e. g. alloys<br>
such as titanium grade 5 or any other suitable material. The material may be selected in<br>
accordance to the preferences of the patient. If the patient feels comfortable to receive<br>
vibrations from the external modular frame to the intracorporal implant 3 and bone structure 1,<br>
the material is selected to transmit such vibrations. Vibrations from the external frame may<br>
promote osseous perception. If a patient does not prefer to receive vibrations from the external<br>
frame, the coupling component 5 or the selected materials may limit or eliminate such<br>
vibrations. The selection of material determines the<br><br>
conduction of heat or cold as well. For this reason, insulation materials, e.g. ceramics or plastics<br>
can be used in combination with their properties of vibration conduction.<br>
Figure 2 shows an example of the joint 6 consisting of a first articulation 61 and a second<br>
articulation 62. A spring 63 is connected into the second articulation 62 and runs over the first<br>
articulation 61. The position of the spring 63 is cr,uciai as to the functioning of the joint 6 or<br>
hinge. The articulations 61, 62 are interconnected by means of an axis 64 which constitutes the<br>
rotation axis of the joint 6.<br>
A fastening device 65 is attached to the first articulation 61 to receive an extension 5' or the<br>
like. A not shown coupling component 5 may be connected to the second articulation 62.<br>
The joint 6 is a modular joint which, on the proximal side, contains a matrix of the not shown<br>
coupling component and whereto, on the distal side, the extension 5' may be connected. A<br>
different version may have the same design with the exception of the possibility of connecting a<br>
distal extension and the saving in respect of an artificial fingernail.<br>
The extension 5' extends to the joint 6 distally and consists of a structure of a free from shape<br>
which is set at a whether or not determined angle and of which the lengths may be vary. At the<br>
end of the distal part room will be created for a nail. An anti-rotation system will avoid<br>
movement, especially rotation around the longitudinal axis. The whole will be anchored to the<br>
joint 6.<br>
Particular interest is paid to the movement of the joint 6. By fixing the external modular frame<br>
5, 6, 5', 7 into various different positions, the finger prosthesis becomes functional. The<br>
selection of the material of the external modular frame 5, 6, 5', 7 and the fixation of the frame<br>
onto the intracorporal components 3, 4 by means of the coupling component 5 will ensure<br>
transmission of forces and, if desired,<br><br>
vibrations caught by the surface of the prosthesis material and translated to the<br>
bone structure 1 by means of the frame.<br>
• The joint 6 may have a rest position, functional position and a resetting position.<br>
Exercising downward pressure on the dorsal side, as indicated by the arrows in<br>
figure 1, distally of the joint axis 64 will cause a transition from the rest position<br>
to the functional position (flexion). This position will automatically be locked thus<br>
the finger will be set to an active functional position. To leave the functional<br>
position again, a downward pressure will be exercised distally of the joint axis<br>
which will set the extensions 5', 7 to a hyper-flexion and will unlock and reset<br>
the system. An aesthetic cover consisting of elastic material such as foam or<br>
soft silicone or elastic components of the modular frame will function as a spring<br>
and will automatically set the frame from the unlocking position to the' rest<br>
position. The joint 6 may also contain a fail safety mechanism which will<br>
dissipate the energy caused by an overload or hyper-rotation. In this case, the<br>
spring 63 buckles due to overload or a control slipping of cylindrical components<br>
of the modular frame, joint and cosmetic cover takes place.<br>
Figure 3 shows the second first articulation 62 with an outer frame 620 showing<br>
an anchoring position or functional position 621, an unlocking course 624 in_<br>
case of hyper-flexion, a return course to the rest position 622 and a rest position<br>
spring 623.<br>
In Figure 4 a finger prosthesis s shown for replacement of a bone structure in<br>
the event of an amputation at the level of the medial phalanx or in the event of<br>
an amputation through the proximal-inter-phalangeal joint (PIP). The implant 3<br>
and the transcutaneous component are connected to the coupling component 5<br>
and the joint 6, wherein the distal part 61 of the joint 6 has on its upper surface<br>
a saving 16 for a nail prosthesis.<br>
Figure 5 shows an alternative embodiment with an implant 3 and a<br>
transcutaneous component 4. The coupling component 5 is part of the joint 6.<br><br>
The joint 6 is extended by the extension 7 to distal. The external modular frame 5, 6, 7 can be<br>
used after amputation at a level of the proximal phalanx, in the event of amputation of the<br>
medial or distal phalanx or in the event of amputation through the proximal or distal inter<br>
phalanx joint.<br>
Figure 6 shows an alternative embodiment with the implant 3 and transcutaneous component 4,<br>
connected to the coupling component 5, which acts at the same time as an extension. The<br>
coupling component 5 is designed as a male joint component, wherein a corresponding female<br>
component acts as an extension 5'. To bend a distal part of the finger prosthesis a metal wire 9<br>
is connected to the coupling component 5 via extension 5'. Folding or bending the metal wire 9<br>
will allow the finger prosthesis to change shape. Around the metal wire 9 a tubular device 19 is<br>
arranged. Alternatively, a spring or spiral may encircle the metal wire 9. A fissure 29 is defined<br>
between the tubular elements 19. The fissure 29 reduces the bending stiffness allowing bending<br>
and allows further the metal wire 9 to move freely within the prosthesis at flexion or extension.<br>
Cylindrical structures may be positioned over the metal wire 9 and anchored thus the metal wire<br>
9 will only bend when free. In this manner the exact iocation of the bending joint may be<br>
determined. The position of the prosthesis may be changed manually. The resistance or bending<br>
stiffness of the metal wire 9, constituting as a core of the external frame, needs to be sufficient<br>
high to allow transfer of loads but need to be sufficient flexible to ensure the function of a<br>
bending joint. Alternatively, the bending joint is used for adaption of the flexion angle of the<br>
metal wire 9 only. The bending of the metal wire 9 additionally functions as a fail safety<br>
mechanism, the bending capacities will dissipate the energy caused by an overload or hyper-<br>
rotation. The metal wire 9 may be elastic-plastic to allow permanent bending flexion.<br>
In. Figure 7 an example of a possible component configuration is shown wherein for a thumb a<br>
prosthesis according to figure 4 is used preferably. A prosthesis according to figure 5 may be<br>
used for the index finger and the middle finger, because these three fingers are more often<br>
used than the ring finger or little<br><br>
finger. Because of the frequent use of the first three fingers, a joint 6 with a hinge and a locking<br>
mechanism as well as a fail safety mechanism is more stable and reliable. The ring finger and<br>
the little finger may be equipped with a prosthesis according to figure 6, in which a fail safety<br>
mechanism is realized by elastic-plastic deformation of the metal wire 9 or an other elastic-<br>
plastic component.<br>
Figure 8 shows a sectional view through an amputated finger with an implant 3 and a<br>
transcutaneous component encircled by soft tissue 2 of the stump. The external modular frame<br>
5, 6, 5', 7 is removed from the transcutaneous component and for protection and/or for<br>
aesthetic reasons a protective cap or cosmetic cover 11 is arranged onto the transcutaneous<br>
component 4. The cover 11 may contain an agent or agents leaving the cover 11 and thus<br>
influencing the soft tissue 2 surrounding the transcutaneous component 4 to stimulate the soft<br>
tissue 2 or the skin 10. An alternative embodiment is shown in Figure 9 in which the cover 11<br>
encircles the transcutaneous component 4 which passes through the cover 11. The cover 11<br>
exercises pressure on the soft tissue 2 surrounding the transcutaneous component 4 as<br>
indicated by the arrows to influence the soft tissue and skin, e.g. healing, growth and<br>
proprioception. The cover can be a part of the extracorporeal modular frame and its cover as<br>
well.<br>
Figure 10 shows in a cross sectional a view of a prosthesis with the intracorporal implant 3<br>
which is integrated in a remaining bone structure 1 of a finger. The transcutaneous component<br>
4, surrounded by the soft tissue 2 is coupled via the coupling component 5 which is in turn<br>
coupled to the proximal part 62 of the joint 6. The distal part 61 of the joint 6 is connected to<br>
an extension 5' and a second distal extension 7 with a saving 16 for a fingernail prosthesis 13.<br>
Around the external modular frame 5, 6, 5', 7 a soft material 12 is arranged, enhancing the grip.<br>
The soft material 12 has an extra-low hardness to promote a larger surface contact when<br>
gripping or getting in contact with objects. The extended modular frame 5, 6, 5', 7 is<br>
surrounded partially by foam 15 or other elastic materials to achieve a natural appearance of an<br>
outer<br><br>
artificial skin in respect to wrinkling, elongation, shortening or buckling of the<br>
skin 14 of the finger prosthesis. These elastic materials 15 may have various<br>
physical characteristics and may promote a return movement into a rest position<br>
after reaching a release position upon bending of joint 6.<br>
The modular frame 5, 6, 5', 7 largely determines the level of functionality of the<br>
finger prosthesis. The cosmetics of the finger prosthesis on the other hand will<br>
be determined by the aesthetic or cosmetic finishing of the elastic material 15<br>
and the artificial • skin 14 as well as the soft material 12. The aesthetic and<br>
functional cover 12, 15, 14 may be made of materials that shall remain smooth<br>
such as polyurethane or silicone elastomers. The nail prosthesis 13 may be<br>
created from a smooth or hard material and may be connected to the aesthetic<br>
cover in mechanical and/or chemical manner. The characteristics of the<br>
selected materials form the aesthetic and functional cover depend on the<br>
position within the finger. Near to the joint 6 a material with a high level of<br>
elasticity and a low E-modulus may be used. Near the top of the finger (distal<br>
end) a smooth material 12 with a low hardness and with high resistance against<br>
abrasion may be selected. The proximal part of the prosthesis may be made of<br>
a material with a high resistance against rubbing and tearing. The whole may be<br>
covered with a thin colored or transparent layer 14 with a high level of abrasion "<br>
resistance. Near the joint 6 the aesthetic cover will be connected to the frame<br>
by the foam material 15 which causes the elasticity of the prosthesis material at<br>
a flexion to be limited to the region between both fixations 61, 62. The room<br>
between the cosmetic cover and the modular frame 5, 6, 5', 7 may eventually<br>

ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
FINGER OR TOE PROSTHESIS<br>
The invention relates to a finger or toe prosthesis having an intracorporal implant and an<br>
external modular frame constituting the core of the finger or toe prosthesis with a certain<br>
number of modules or components, each with its own function, e.g. a joint, which will be<br>
assembled to constitute one modular frame, wherein the external modular frame is displaceable<br>
fixed to the intracorporal implant. The invention relates to a fail safety mechanism for a finger or<br>
toe prosthesis, too, wherein the external modular frame is coupled to the intracorporal implant<br>
by a friction-type blocking, a form fit locking a spring loaded hinge or a non-linear spring<br>
allowing hyper-extension or hyper-flexion, ductile deformation or breaking at a predetermined<br>
load, The invention relates to a cosmetic or function cover of the external modular frame as<br>
well, which is attached to the frame and supports the function of the frame.</td>
