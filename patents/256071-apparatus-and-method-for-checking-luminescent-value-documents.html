[001] This invention relates to an apparatus and method for checking in particular<br>
luminescent value documents wherein the value document is irradiated with light and<br>
the luminescence radiation emanating from the value document is detected with<br>
spectral resolution.<br>
[002] Such luminescent value documents can be e.g. bank notes, checks, coupons<br>
or chip cards. Although not restricted thereto, the present invention deals primarily<br>
with the check of bank notes. The latter typically contain in the paper or printing ink a<br>
feature substance or a mixture of a plurality of feature substances that show<br>
luminescence behavior, e.g. that fluoresce or phosphoresce.<br>
[003] There are a number of known systems for checking the authenticity of such<br>
value documents. One system is known for example from DE 23 66 217 C2. In this<br>
system, to check the authenticity of a bank note, i.e. check specifically whether a<br>
fluorescent feature substance is actually present in a bank note to be checked, the latter<br>
is irradiated obliquely and the perpendicularly remitted fluorescence radiation detected<br>
with spectral resolution using an interference filter. Evaluation is done by comparing<br>
the signals from different photocells of the spectrometer. <br>
[004] This system works very reliably in most cases. However, there is a need for<br>
a luminescence sensor that has a more compact construction and can still check<br>
reliably enough at very low intensities of the luminescence radiation to be detected.<br><br>
DE 101 27 837 Al discloses an apparatus and method for checking<br>
documents, particularly documents of value, passports and security<br>
documents. The apparatus comprises at least one excitation device for<br>
excitation of luminescence light in or on a document of value to be<br>
checked and at least two detector units for capturing at least a part of the<br>
luminescence light emitted by the document. The problems with regard to<br>
the safe capturing of the luminescence radiation arising from the high<br>
transport speed are not mentioned in this reference. It follows that, in<br>
particular an illumination area, which is longer in the transport direction<br>
than in the direction perpendicular to the transport direction, is not<br>
disclosed.<br>
EP 1 158 459 Al describes a method and an apparatus for checking the<br>
authenticity of a feature. In particular, the time-dependent course of the<br>
intensity of luminescence radiation of a luminescent feature is used for the<br>
authenticity checking. More precisely, a luminescent feature is excited<br>
with at least on excitation pulse of at least one excitation source and<br>
emission intensity values of the radiation emitted by the luminescent<br>
feature in response to the emission pulse are measured within time<br>
intervals. Then, an intensity-time-emission-function of the emission<br>
intensity values is determined. This function is compared to at least one<br>
reference intensity-time-emission-function, wherein the two emission<br>
functions are normalized before the comparison. The problems with regard<br>
to the safe capturing of the luminescence radiation arising from the high<br>
transport speed are only mentioned as far as a special sensor is described<br>
that allows an exceptionally fast readout of intensity values. It follows<br>
that, in particular an illumination area, which is longer in the transport<br>
direction than in the direction perpendicular to the transport direction, is<br>
not disclosed by this reference.<br>
US 6 061 121 relates to a remission sensor<br>
[005] On these premises it is a problem of the present invention to provide an<br>
apparatus and method for checking luminescent value documents that permit a reliable<br>
check with a compact luminescence sensor.<br>
[006] This problem is solved by the independent claims. The dependent claims and<br>
the following description explain preferred embodiments.<br><br><br>
[007] Since the value document to be checked transported past the luminescence sensor<br>
in a transport direction is illuminated with an illumination area extending in the transport<br>
direction, it is also possible to effectively measure value documents that emit very little<br>
luminescence radiation. This substantially improves in particular the measurement of<br>
phosphorescence radiation.<br>
[008] It is specially emphasized that the features of the dependent claims and the<br>
embodiments stated in the following description can be used advantageously in combination<br>
or also independently of each other and of the subject matter of the main claims, e.g. also in<br>
apparatuses that do not produce an illumination area extending in the transport direction or<br>
that perform a measurement of radiation other than luminescence radiation.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an apparatus for enabling fast and reliable<br>
checking of luminescent value documents transported at high speed, comprising a<br>
luminescence radiation exciting light source and a luminescence sensor arranged to detect<br>
with spectral resolution luminescence radiation excited by the light source emanating from a<br>
value document illuminated by the light source, characterized in that said light source<br>
produces on the value document when the document is transported in a transport direction<br>
past the luminescence sensor an illumination area extending in the transport direction, and in<br>
that the extension of the illumination area in the transport direction is at least twice as long as<br>
the extension perpendicular to the transport direction.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for enabling fast and reliable checking of<br>
luminescent value documents transported at high speed with a luminescence sensor,<br>
characterized in that the value document to be checked is irradiated to excite luminescence<br>
radiation and the luminescence radiation emanating from the value document is detected with<br>
spectral resolution, comprising the steps of: transporting the value document to be checked<br>
past the luminescence sensor in a transport direction, and illuminating the document with an<br>
illumination area which extends in the transport direction, and in that the extension of the<br>
illumination area in the transport direction is at least twice as long as the extension<br>
perpendicular to the transport direction.<br><br>
[009] Further advantages of the present invention will hereinafter be explained more<br>
closely by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings. The figures are<br>

[0010] The inventive apparatuses can be used in all kinds of apparatuses for check-<br>
ing optical radiation, in particular luminescence radiation. Although not re-<br>
stricted thereto the followig description will relate to the preferred variant<br>
of checking bank notes in bank note processing apparatuses that can be used<br>
for example for counting and/or sorting and/or denositiup and/or dispensing<br>
bank notes.<br>
[0011] Fig. 1 shows such a bank note sorting apparatus 1 in exemplary fashion. The<br>
bank note sorting apparatus 1 has in a housing 2 an input pocket 3 for bank<br>
notes BN to which bank notes BN to be processed can cither be manually fed<br>
from outside or bank-note bundles can be automatically supplied, optionally<br>
after debanding. The bank notes BN fed to the input pocket 3 are removed<br>
singly from the stack by a singler 4 and transported through a sensor device 6<br>
by means of a transport device 5. The sensor device 6 can have one or more<br>
sensor modules integrated in a common housing or mounted in separate<br>
housings. The sensor modules can be used e.g. for checking the authenticity<br>
and/or state and/or nominal value of the checked bank notes BN. After run-<br>
ning through the sensor device 6 the checked bank notes BN are then sorted<br>
in dependence on the check results of the sensor uevice 6 anu given sorting<br><br>
criteria and output via gates 7 and associated spiral slot stackers 8 into output<br>
pockets 9 from which they can be either removed manually or carried off au-<br>
tomatically, optionally after banding or packaging. A shredder 10 can also be<br>
provided for destroying bank notes BN classified as authentic and no longer<br>
fit for circulation. The control of the bank note sorting apparatus 1 is effect-<br>
ed by means of a computer-aided control unit 11.<br>
[0012] As mentioned above, the sensor device 6 can have different sensor modules.<br>
The sensor device 6 is characterized in particular by a sensor module 12 for<br>
checking luminescence radiation, to be referred to hereinafter for short as lu-<br>
minescence sensor 12. Fig. 2 illustrates in a schematic cross-sectional view<br>
the inner structure and the arrangement of the optical components of a lumi-<br>
nescence sensor 12 with a particularly compact design according to an em-<br>
bodiment of the present invention. Fig. 3 moreover shows a top view of a<br>
part of said components located inside the luminescence sensor 12. Said lu-<br>
minescence sensor 12 is of particularly compact design and optimized with<br>
[0013] The luminescence sensor 12 specifically has in a common housing 13 both<br>
one or more light sources 14 for exciting luminescence radiation, and a de-<br>
tector 30, preferably a spectrometer 30, for spectrally decomposed detection<br>
of the luminescence light. The housing 13 is sealed in such a way that unau-<br>
thorized access to the components contained therein is not possible without<br>
damaging the housing 13.<br>
[0014] The light source 14 can be e.g. an LED, but preferably a laser light source<br>
such as a laser diode 14. The laser diode 14 can emit one or more different<br>
wavelengths or wavelength ranges. If a plurality of different wavelengths or<br>
wavelength ranges are used, it can also be provided that the same light<br>
source housing or separate light source housings, i.e. separate light source<br>
modules, contain a plurality of light sources 14 for different wavelengths or<br>
wavelength ranges which are disposed e.g. side by side and preferably radi-<br><br>
ate parallel light which can be projected onto the same place or adjacent<br>
places on the bank note BN.<br>
[0015] If the light sources 14 can emit light of a plurality of different wavelengths<br>
or wavelength ranges, it can be provided that the individual wavelengths or<br>
wavelength ranges are activable selectively.<br>
[0016] A further variant will be described hereinafter with reference to Fig. 4.<br>
[0017] The light emanating from the laser diode 14 is radiated by means of an imag-<br>
ing optic 15, 16, 17 onto a bank note to be checked. The imaging optic com-<br>
prises a collimator lens 15, a deflection mirror as a beam splitter 16, in par-<br>
ticular a dichroic beam splitter 16, which deflects by 90° the laser beam ema-<br>
nating from the laser diode 14 and shaped by the collimator lens 15, and a<br>
condenser lens 17 with a large angle of beam spread which images the de-<br>
flected laser beam through a front glass 18 preferably perpendicularly onto<br>
the bank note BN to be checked transported past in the direction T by means<br>
of the transport system 5, thereby exciting the bank note BN to emit lumines-<br>
cence radiation.<br>
[0018] With the help of the spectrometer 30 the luminescence radiation emanating<br>
from the illuminated bank note BN is then preferably detected likewise per-<br>
pendicularly, i.e. coaxially to the excitation light. This leads to a lower inter-<br>
ference sensitivity through orientation tolerances of the transported bank<br>
notes BN on the measurements than in the case of oblique illumination e.g.<br>
according to DE 23 66 274 C2.<br>
[0019] The optic for imaging the luminescence radiation onto a photosensitive de-<br>
tector unit 21 likewise comprises the front glass 18, the condenser lens 17<br>
and the mirror 16 at least partly transparent to the luminescence radiation to<br>
be measured. Moreover, the optic subsequently has a further condenser lens<br>
19 with a large opening, a following filter 20 designed to block the illumina-<br>
tion wavelength of the light source 14 and other wavelengths not to be mea-<br>
sured, and a deflection mirror 23. The deflection mirror 23 serves to fold the<br><br>
beam path and deflect the luminescence radiation to be measured onto an<br>
imaging grating 24 or another device for spectral decomposition 24. The de-<br>
flection mirror is advantageously mounted parallel or almost parallel to the<br>
focal plane of the spectrometer (angle 
ture as possible. The imaging grating 24 has a wavelength dispersing ele-<br>
ment with a concave mirror 26 which preferably images the first-order or mi-<br>
nus first-order luminescence radiation onto the detector unit 21. Higher or-<br>
ders can also be imaged, however. The detector unit 21 preferably has a de-<br>
tector row 22 comprising a plurality of photosensitive pixels, i.e. image<br>
points, disposed in a row, as described hereinafter by way of example e.g.<br>
with respect to Figure 6 or 7.<br>
The shape of the illumination area allows a longer illumination time for the luminescent area,<br>
while at the same time the resolution in a direction transverse to the transport direction<br>
remains unchanged. Due to extended illumination, luminescence radiation is generated over a<br>
longer time period and can be captured by the respective sensor in an integrating manner.<br>
[0020] The entrance slit of the spectrometer 30 is marked in Fig. 2 by the reference<br>
sign AS. The entrance slit AS can be present in the housing 13 in the form of<br>
an aperture AS in the beam path. However, it is also possible that there is no<br>
aperture present at this point, but only a "virtual" entrance slit AS which is<br>
given by the iiiumination track of the light source 14 on the bank note BN.<br>
The latter variant leads to higher light intensities, but can also lead to an un-<br>
desirable greater sensitivity to ambient light or scattered light.<br>
[0021] In a further embodiment, the deflection mirror 23 is so placed with respect to<br>
the imaging grating 24 that the entrance slit AS falls on the area of the de-<br>
flection mirror 23. Since this makes the beam cross section of the radiation<br>
to be deflected particularly small on the deflection mirror 23, the deflection<br>
mirror 23 itself can also have particularly small dimensions. If the deflection<br>
mirror 23 is a component of the detector unit 21, the deflection mirror 23 can<br>
thus be mounted not only above the photosensitive areas of the detector unit<br>
21, according to Figure 2, but also beside mem.<br>
[0022] It is a special idea of the present invention that the light source 14 for excit-<br>
ing luminescence radiation produces an elongate illumination area 35 ex-<br>
tending in the transport direction T on the bank note BN to be checked.<br><br>
[0023] This variant has the advantage that the luminescent, in particular phospho-<br>
rescent, feature substances usually present in the bank notes BN only in very<br>
low concentrations are pumped up longer by the illumination area extending<br>
in the transport direction during transport past the luminescence sensor 12,<br>
thereby increasing in particular the radiation intensity of the persistent phos-<br>
phorescent feature substances.<br>
[0024] Fig. 5 illustrates an associated instantaneous view. An elongate illumination<br>
area 35 extending in the transport direction T can be understood to mean that<br>
the illumination radiation irradiates at a given moment an area of any form,<br>
in particular a rectangular track, on the bank note that is significantly larger<br>
in the transport direction T than perpendicular to the transport direction T.<br>
Preferably, the extension of the illumination area 35 in the transport direction<br>
T will be at least twice, particularly preferably at least three times, four times<br>
or five times, as long as the extension perpendicular to the transport direction<br>
T.<br>
[0025] Fig. 5 illustrates with a different hatching likewise the image area 36, i.e. the<br>
entrance pupil 36 of the spectrometer 30, i.e. that area of the bank note BN<br>
that is imaged onto the spectrometer 30 at the given moment according to the<br>
dimensions of the entrance slit AS. It can be recognized that the length and<br>
width of the entrance pupil 36 of the spectrometer 30 are preferably smaller<br>
than the corresponding dimensions of the illumination area 35 of the laser<br>
diode 14. This permits greater alignment tolerances for the individual sensor<br>
components.<br>
[0026] Further, the instantaneous view of Fig. 5 shows the case that the illumination<br>
area 35 extends substantially further in the transport direction T than against<br>
the transport direction T in comparison with the image area 36. This is par-<br>
ticularly advantageous tor utilizing me increased pump-up effect. However,<br>
it can alternatively also be provided that the illumination area 35 and the im-<br>
age area 36 overlap only partly in the transport direction T. If the image area<br>
36 is disposed symmetrically, i.e. in the middle of the illumination area 35,<br><br>
however, the luminescence sensor 6 can be transported both in apparatuses 1<br>
in which bank notes BN are transported in the transport direction T shown<br>
and in apparatuses 1 in which bank notes BN are transported in the opposite<br>
direction -T.<br>
[0027] According to a further special idea of the present invention, different detec-<br>
tor units 21, 27 are used for detecting the luminescence radiation, in particu-<br>
lar the luminescence radiation emanating from the device for spectral de-<br>
composition 24, e.g. the imaging grating 24. Thus, it is possible to provide<br>
on or before the further detector unit 27 e.g. a filter for measuring only in<br>
one or more given wavelengths or wavelength ranges, whereby the measur-<br>
able spectral ranges of the different detector units 21,27 preferably differ<br>
and e.g. overlap only partly or not at all. It is emphasized that a plurality of<br>
further detector units 27 can also be present that measure in different wave-<br>
lengths or wavelength ranges. The plurality of further detector units 27 can<br>
be spaced apart or also be present in a sandwich structure, as described by<br>
way of example in DE 101 27 837 Al.<br>
[0028] While the one detector unit 21, i.e. specifically the detector row 22, is de-<br>
signed for spectrally resolved measurement of the luminescence radiation of<br>
the bank note BN, the at least one further detector unit 27 can thus be used to<br>
perform at least one other measurement of the luminescence radiation, such<br>
as additionally or alternatively a measurement of the broadband, spectrally<br>
unresolved zeroth order of the spectrometer 30 and/or the decay behavior of<br>
the luminescence radiation.<br>
[0029] Further, the further detector unit 27 can also be designed to check another<br>
optical property of the at least one feature substance of the bank note BN.<br>
This can be done e.g. by the stated measurements at other wavelengths or<br>
wavelength ranges. Preferably, the further detector unit 27 can also be de-<br>
signed to check another feature substance of the bank note BN. Thus, e.g, the<br>
detector row 22 can be designed for measuring the optical properties of a<br>
first feature substance of the bank note BN, and the further detector unit 27<br><br>
for measuring another feature substance of the bank note BN, in particular<br>
also in a different spectral range from the detector row 22. The detectors 22,<br>
27 will preferably have filters for suppressing undesirable scattered light or<br>
higher-order light during measurement.<br>
[0030] As can be recognized in the plan view of Fig. 3, said further detector unit 27,<br>
in particular when designed for measuring the zeroth order of the spectrome-<br>
ter 30, can be disposed on a tilt with respect to the imaging grating 24 and<br>
the detector row 22 to avoid a disturbing re-reflection onto the concave mir-<br>
ror 26. In this case, a radiation-absorptive light trap, such as a black colored<br>
area, can additionally be present at the end of the beam path of the radiation<br>
emanating from the further detector unit 27.<br>
[0031] For calibration and functional testing of the luminescence sensor 12, a refer-<br>
ence sample 32 with one or more luminescent feature substances can further<br>
be provided, which can have an identical or different chemical composition<br>
to the luminescent feature substances to be checked in the bank notes BN. As<br>
shown in Fig. 2, said reference sample 32 can be integrated in the housing 13<br>
itself and applied e.g. as a foil 32 to a further light source (LED 31) which is<br>
disposed opposite the laser diode 14 with respect to the beam splitter 16. The<br>
reference sample 32 can instead e.g. also be a separate component between<br>
LED 31 and angular mirror 16. For calibration e.g. in the pauses between<br>
two bank note measuring cycles of the luminescence sensor 12 the reference<br>
sample 32 can then be excited by irradiation by means of the LED 31 to emit<br>
a defined luminescence radiation which is imaged onto the detector row 22<br>
by parasitic reflection on the dichroic beam splitter 16 and evaluated.<br>
[0032] For intensity calibration of the spectrometer 30, the luminescent feature sub-<br>
stances of the reference sample 32 can emit preferably broadband, e.g. over<br>
the total spectral range detectable by the spectrometer 30. However, the lu-<br>
minescent feature substances of the reference sample 32 can alternatively or<br>
additionally emit a certain characteristic spectral signature with narrowband<br>
peaks for performing a wavelength calibration. However, it is also possible<br><br>
that only the further light source 31 without the reference sample 32 is used<br>
for adjustment of the spectrometer 30.<br>
[0033] Alternatively or additionally, the reference sample 32 can therefore also be<br>
mounted outside the housing 13, in particular on the opposite side with re-<br>
spect to the bank note BN to be measured, and be integrated e.g. in an oppos-<br>
ing element, such as a plate 28.<br>
[0034] Outside the housing 13 an additional detector unit 33 can also be present as a<br>
separate component or integrated in the plate 28. The additional detector unit<br>
33 can be e.g. one or more photocells for measuring the radiation of the laser<br>
diode 14 that has passed through the front glass 18 and optionally through<br>
the bank note BN, and/or the luminescence radiation of the bank note BN. In<br>
this case, the plate 28 can be mounted displaceably in direction P in a guide,<br>
so that alternatively either the reference sample 32 or the photocell 33 can be<br>
aligned with the illumination radiation of the laser diode 14.<br>
[0035] The plate 28 will preferably be connected to the housing 13 via a connection<br>
element 55, drawn dotted, which is outside the transport plane of the bank<br>
notes BN. In a cross-sectional plane extending horizontally in Fig. 2 there is<br>
then an approximately U-shaped form of housing 13, connection area 55 and<br>
plate 28. This way of mounting the plate 28, also in an alternative variant<br>
without the reference sample 32 and photocell 33, has the advantage of pro-<br>
viding a light shield against the undesirable exit of laser radiation of the laser<br>
diode 14. If the plate 28 is fastened detachably to ihe housing 13 for mainte-<br>
nance puiposes or for clearing a jam, it can be provided that the laser diode<br>
14 is deactivated when the plate 28 is detached or removed.<br>
[0036] Figure 4 shows a schematic cross-sectional view of an alternative and very<br>
compact luminescence sensor 6 which can be used in the bank note sorting<br>
apparatus according to Fig. 1. The same components are marked with the<br>
same reference numbers as in Fig. 2.<br><br>
[0037] The arrangement of the optical components in the luminescence sensor 6 ac-<br>
cording to Fig. 4 differs from the luminescence sensor 6 according to Fig. 2<br>
in particular in that the deflection mirror 23 can be omitted. It is noted that<br>
the luminescence sensor 6 according to Fig. 4 does not have any further de-<br>
tector units 31,33 either, although this would be possible. In this case the<br>
dichroic beam splitter 16 causes not the illumination radiation, but the lumi-<br>
nescence radiation to be deflected in mirrored fashion.<br>
[0038] Further, the light source 14 two has mutually perpendicular laser diodes 51,<br>
52 which emit at different wavelengths, whereby the radiation of the individ-<br>
ual laser diodes 51,52 can be coupled in e.g. by a further dichroic beam<br>
splitter 53, so that the same illumination area 35 or overlapping or spaced il-<br>
lumination areas 35 can be irradiated on the bank note BN. Preferably, either<br>
one or the other laser diode 51, 52 or both laser diodes 51, 52 can alternative-<br>
ly be activated simultaneously or alternatingly for radiation emission, de-<br>
pending on the bank note to be checked.<br>
[0039] The photosensitive detector elements recognizable in an upright projection,<br>
i.e. the detector row 22, is mounted on the carrier asymmetrically, as to be<br>
explained more closely with respect to Figure 7.<br>
[0040] Moreover, the luminescence sensor 6 preferably has in the housing 13 itself<br>
a control unit 50 which is used for the signal processing of the measuring<br>
values of the spectrometer 30 and/or for the power control of the individual<br>
components of the luminescence sensor 6.<br>
[0041] With reference to Figs. 6 and 7, two different variants of the detector rows<br>
22 usable in the luminescence sensor 12 will now be described. Fig. 6 shows<br>
in a detail view a conventional detector row 22 which normally has more<br>
than 100 photosensitive picture elements, called pixels 40 for short, disposed<br>
side by side (of which Fig. 6 only shows the first seven left-hand pixels 40)<br>
which are equally large and spaced apart on or in a substrate 41 at a distance<br>
corresponding approximately to the width of the pixels 40.<br><br>
[0042] In contrast, it is preferable to use a modified detector row 22 with a consider-<br>
ably smaller number of pixels 40, with a larger pixel area and a smaller share<br>
of non-photosensitive areas, as illustrated by way of example in Fig. 7. Such<br>
a modified detector row 22 has the advantage of having a considerably<br>
greater signal-to-noise ratio than the conventional detector row 22 of Fig. 6.<br>
Preferably, the modified detector rows 22 are so constructed that they have<br>
only between 10 and 32, particularly preferably between 10 and 20, single<br>
pixels 40 in or on a substrate 41. The individual pixels 40 can have dimen-<br>
sions of at least 0.5 mm x 0.5 mm, preferably of 0.5 mm x 1 mm, particularly<br>
preferably of 1 mm x 1 mm. According to the embodiment of Fig. 7, the de-<br>
tector row 22 has by way of example twelve pixels 40 with a height of 2 mm<br>
and a width of 1 mm, the non-photosensitive area 41 between adjacent pixels<br>
40 having an extension of about 50 um.<br>
[0043] Further, it can also be provided that single pixels 40 have different dimen-<br>
sions, in particular in the dispersion direction of the luminescence radiation<br>
particular wavelengths (or wavelength ranges) to be evaluated.<br>
[0044] Depending on the wavelength range to be spectrally detected, the detector<br>
row 22 can consist of a different material in the stated cases. For lumines-<br>
cence measurements in the ultraviolet or visible spectral range, detectors<br>
made of silicon which are sensitive below about 1100 nm are particularly<br>
suitable, and for measurement in the infrared spectral range, detector rows 22<br>
made of InGaAs which are sensitive above 900 nm. Preferably, such an In-<br>
GaAs detector row 22 will be applied directly to a silicon substrate 42 which<br>
particularly preferably has an amplifier stage produced by silicon technology<br>
for amplifying the analog signals of the pixels 40 of the InGaAs detector row<br>
22. This likewise provides a particularly compact structure with short signal<br>
paths and an increased signal-to-noise ratio.<br><br>
[0045] The detector row 22 with few pixels 40 (e.g. according to Fig. 7) preferably<br>
detects only a relatively small spectral range of less than 500 nm, particularly<br>
preferably of less than or about 300 nm. It can also be provided that the de-<br>
tector row 22 has at least one pixel 40 that is photosensitive outside the lumi-<br>
nescence spectrum to be measured in the bank notes BN, for performing nor-<br>
malizations such as baseline finding during evaluation of the measured lumi-<br>
nescence spectrum.<br>
[0046] The imaging grating 24 will preferably have more than about 300 lines/mm,<br>
particularly preferably more than about 500 lines/mm, i.e. diffraction ele-<br>
ments, for permitting a sufficient dispersion of the luminescence radiation<br>
onto the detector element 21 despite the compact structure of the inventive<br>
luminescence sensors 6. The distance between imaging grating 24 and detec-<br>
tor element 21 can be preferably less than about 70 mm, particularly prefer-<br>
ably less than about 50 mm.<br>
[0047] A readout of the individual pixels 40 of the detector row 22 can be effected<br>
here e.g. serially with the help of a shift register. However, a parallel readout<br>
of single pixels 40 and/or pixel groups of the detector row 22 will preferably<br>
be effected. According to the example of Fig. 9, the three left-hand pixels 40<br>
are each read singly by the measuring signals of said pixels 40 being ampli-<br>
fied using a respective amplifier stage 45, which can e.g. be part of the sili-<br>
con substrate 42 according to Fig. 7, and supplied to a respective analog/dig-<br>
ital converter 46. The two right-hand pixels in the schematic representation<br>
of Fig. 9, in turn, are first amplified by means of separate amplifier stages<br>
45, then supplied to a common multiplex unit 47, which can optionally also<br>
comprise a sample and hold circuit, and then to a common analog/digital<br>
converter 46 which is connected to the multiplex unit 47.<br>
groups permits short integration times and a synchronized measurement of<br>
the bank note BN. This measure likewise contributes to an increase in the<br>
signal-to-noise ratio.<br><br>
[0049] According to a further independent idea of the present invention, an integra-<br>
tion of components of the imaging optic for the luminescence radiation with<br>
components of the detector 30 is effected. Specifically, the deflection mirror<br>
23 for deflecting the luminescence radiation to be detected onto the spec-<br>
trometer 30 can be connected directly to the detector unit 21, as shown e.g.<br>
in Fig. 2.<br>
[0050] Fig. 7 shows a modified variant in which the deflection mirror 23 is applied<br>
directly to a common carrier with the detector row 22, i.e. specifically to the<br>
silicon substrate 42. Alternatively, the deflection mirror 23 can e.g. also be<br>
applied to a cover glass of the detector unit 21.<br>
[0051] Further, a photodetector, such as a photocell 56, can also be present below<br>
the deflection mirror 23. This preferred variant is shown by way of example<br>
in Figure 8 which shows a cross section along the line I-I of Figure 7. In this<br>
case, the deflection mirror 23 applied to the photocell 56 is at least partly<br>
transparent to the wavelengths to be measured by the photocell 56. The pho-<br>
tocell 56 can again be used for calibrating purposes and/or for evaluating<br>
other properties of the luminescence radiation.<br>
[0052] As illustrated in Figure 4, the detector row 22 can preferably be applied<br>
asymmetrically to the carrier, i.e. the silicon substrate 42, not only for rea-<br>
sons of a compact sensor design, as illustrated in Figure 4, but also for at-<br>
taching further optical components 23, 56.<br>
[0053] As mentioned, due to the very low signal intensities of the luminescence ra-<br>
diation normally expected in the check of bank notes BN, a calibration of the<br>
luminescence sensor 12 will be required during ongoing operation, i.e.<br>
specifically e.g. in the pauses between two bank note measuring cycles of the<br>
luminescence sensor 12. A possible measure already described is to use the<br>
reference samples 32.<br>
[0054] According to a further idea, this can also be done by an active mechanical<br>
displacement of the optical components of the luminescence sensor 12,<br><br>
whereby the displacement can be controlled e.g. by an external control unit<br>
11 or preferably by an internal control unit 50 in dependence on measuring<br>
values of the luminescence sensor 12.<br>
[0055] For example, the component of the imaging grating 24 can be mounted dis-<br>
placeably in the direction S by an actuator 25. It is likewise possible to use<br>
other components not shown to obtain a mechanical displacement of other<br>
optical components, such as the detector 21 which can be displaceable ac-<br>
tively driven e.g. in the direction of the arrow D in Fig. 2. A displacement of<br>
the optical components in more than one direction can also be carried out.<br>
[0056] Thus, an evaluation of the measuring values of the luminescence sensor 12<br>
can e.g. be carried out during the ongoing operation of the luminescence sen-<br>
sor 12, and if the measuring values (e.g. of the detector row 22, the further<br>
detector unit 27 or the photocell 33) or quantities derived therefrom deviate<br>
from certain reference values or ranges, an active mechanical displacement<br>
of single or several optical components of the luminescence sensor 12 can be<br>
carried out to obtain an increased signal gain and a compensation of undesir-<br>
able changes e.g. due to temperature fluctuations triggered by the illumina-<br>
tion or electronics, or signs of aging of optical components. This is particu-<br>
larly important for a detector unit 21 with few pixels 40.<br>
[0057] To increase the lifetime of the light sources of the luminescence sensor 12, it<br>
can also be provided that for example the laser diode 14 is driven at high<br>
power only when a bank note BN is located in the area of the measuring win-<br>
dow, i.e. the front glass 18.<br>
[0058] Further alternatives or additions are of course also conceivable for the<br>
above-described variants.<br>
[0059] While examples in which the imaging grating 24 has a concavely curved sur-<br>
face were described with respect to Figures 2 and 4, a plane grating can al-<br>
ternatively also be used. The structure of such a luminescence sensor 12 is il-<br>
lustrated by way of example in Figure 10. The radiation emanating from the<br><br>
bank note BN to be checked and detected through an entrance window 18<br>
also falls in this case through a collimation lens 17 onto a beam splitter 16<br>
from which the light is deflected by 90° and falls through a lens 19 and a fil-<br>
ter 20 for illumination suppression onto a first spherical collimator mirror 70.<br>
From said mirror 70 the radiation is deflected onto a plane grating 71. The<br>
light spectrally decomposed by the latter is then directed through a second<br>
spherical collimator mirror 72 and a cylindrical lens 73 onto a detector array<br>
21.<br>
[0060] The luminescence sensor 12 of Figure 10 is further characterized in that the<br>
illumination light is coupled in by means of a light guide coupling. Specifi-<br>
cally, the light produced by a laser light source 68 is radiated through a light<br>
guide 69, a beam shaping optic 66, the beam splitter 16, the collimation lens<br>
17 and the entrance window 18 onto the bank note to be checked. Since light<br>
guides 69 are flexible and deformabie so that the illumination beam path can<br>
extend (largely) wherever desired, it is e.g. possible to fasten the light source<br>
at a particularly space-saving place in the housing 13.<br>
[0061] In particular when such light guides are used, the light source can even be<br>
mounted outside the housing 13 of the luminescence sensor 12. This spatial<br>
separation has the advantage that the heat produced by the light source 68 is<br>
interferes considerably less with the operation and the adjustment of the oth-<br>
er optical components located in the housing 13 and in particular also the<br>
highly sensitive detectors 21. Figure ] 1 shows a corresponding schematic ex-<br>
ample in which a light source 68 irradiates into a light guide 69 which leads<br>
into the housing 13 of a luminescence sensor 12. The housing 13 can be con-<br>
structed by way of example like that of Figure 10, the only difference being<br>
that the light source 68 is thus located outside the housing 13 so that the light<br>
guide 69 also extends outside the housing 13.<br>
[0062] A further special feature of the light coupling e.g. according to Figure 11 is<br>
that the light guide 69 connecting the light source 69 and the housing 13 is<br>
coiled in spiral shape in a middle area 70 shown schematically in a cross-sec-<br><br>
tional view in Figure 11. When the light source 68 irradiates into the light<br>
guide 69 there is a series of total reflections in the light guide 69. This causes<br>
the beam cross section of the coupled-in laser radiation of the light source 68<br>
to be spatially homogenized. This has the advantage that the illumination<br>
fluctuates less during the check so that more reproducible check results can<br>
be achieved. For this purpose the light guide need not necessarily be coiled<br>
in a spiral shape in a plane, however. What is essential is rather only that the<br>
light guide has a certain length. Thus, the light guide 69 will preferably have<br>
a length of 1 m to 20 m at a fiber cross section of 50 µm to 200 µm.<br>
[0063] Likewise, it is alternatively conceivable that the irradiation of the bank note<br>
to be checked is effected exclusively via optical components present outside<br>
the housing 13, and the luminescence sensor 12 comprises inside the housing<br>
13 only the optical components that are used for measuring the radiation em-<br>
anating from the illuminated bank note.<br>
[0064] For stabilizing the illumination beam it is e.g. also possible to use a so-called<br>
DFB laser, in which an additional grating is built into the resonator of the<br>
laser, or a so-called DFR laser, in which an additional grating is built in out-<br>
side the resonator of the laser.<br>
[0065] Although preferred variants of the check using a grating spectrometer, i.e. a<br>
spectrometer 30 with an imaging grating 24, were described above by way of<br>
example, it is basically also possible to do without a grating spectrometer<br>
and use e.g. a spectrometer 30 with a prism for spectral dispersion or per-<br>
form a measurement using different filters for filtering out different wave-<br>
lengths or wavelength ranges to be detected in the luminescence radiation.<br>
This can be used in particular also for a multitrack or a highly sensitive mea-<br>
surement.<br>
[0066] An example of a luminescence sensor 1 without a grating spectrometer is il-<br>
lustrated in Figure 12. Figure 12 shows schematically oniy the detection part<br>
of a luminescence sensor. All other components such as the housing, the illu-<br>
mination and the imaging optics are omitted for clarity's sake. According to<br><br>
this example of Figure 12, the beam emanating from the bank note BN to be<br>
checked is deflected via a deflection mirror 57 rotatable around a rotation<br>
axis 58 selectively onto single detectors 59 which are sensitive to different<br>
wavelengths or wavelength ranges. This can be done firstly by selecting de-<br>
tector areas photosensitive in different wavelength ranges for the detectors<br>
59. However, it is also possible, as indicated by way of example in Figure<br>
12, to dispose filters 60 for different wavelength ranges upstream of the de-<br>
tectors 59 and preferably also fasten them to the latter themselves.<br>
[0067] It is likewise possible to use a so-called filter wheel with different filters.<br>
Rotation of the filter wheel then causes the individual different filters to suc-<br>
cessively cross the light beam of the bank note BN to be checked that is sub-<br>
sequently incident on the detector.<br>
[0068] Figure 13 shows very schematically a detector 61 according to yet another<br>
example. The detector has a row or an array of same-type photosensitive pix-<br>
els 63 on a substrate 62. On the detector 61 there is mounted above the pixels<br>
63 a filter 64 which has a gradient of the filter wavelength that is indicated in<br>
the direction of the arrow. This means that different wavelengths are filtered<br>
out at different places of the filter 64, regarded in the direction of the arrow.<br>
The use of such a filter 64 with a filter wavelength gradient has the advan-<br>
tage that the light to be checked can be radiated directly onto the detector 61,<br>
and no wavelength dispersing elements such as the grating 24 or the deflec-<br>
tion mirrors 23, 57 are required. The structure of the luminescence sensor 1<br>
can thus be designed particularly simply and with fewer components.<br>
[0069] Moreover, it is for example also possible to use the active optical displace-<br>
ment of single components advantageously not only in the particularly pre-<br>
ferred example of a luminescence sensor, but also with other, in particular<br>
other optical, sensors. Furthermore, e.g. the special embodiment of the spec-<br>
trometer is also of advantage when the luminescence sensor itself does not<br>
have a light source for exciting luminescence radiation.<br><br>
[0070] Further, the inventive system can also be so designed that the measuring val-<br>
ues of the luminescence sensor 12 of one bank note BN are still being evalu-<br>
ated while measuring values of a subsequent bank note BN are already being<br>
sensed at the same time. The evaluation of the measuring values of the previ-<br>
ous bank note BN must be done so fast, however, that the individual gates 7<br>
of the transport path 5 can be switched fast enough for deflecting the previ-<br>
ous bank note BN into the associated storage pocket 9.<br>
[0071] The inventive apparatuses and methods consequently permit a simple and re-<br>
liable check and distinction of luminescent value documents. The check can<br>
be effected e.g. by the light source 14 producing a light with a first wave-<br>
length with a given intensity for a certain time duration 0-t1 for exciting the<br>
feature substance. The light of the light source 14 excites the feature sub-<br>
stance of the bank note BN to be checked transported past the front glass 18<br>
in the direction T, whereupon the feature substance emits luminescence light<br>
of a second wavelength. The intensity of the emitted luminescence light in-<br>
creases douring the time duration 0-tp of the excitation accoruing to a certain<br>
principle. The manner of increase and decrease of the intensity of the emitted<br>
luminescence light is dependent on the feature substance used and on the ex-<br>
citing light source 14, i.e. its intensity and wavelength or wavelength distri-<br>
bution. After the end of the excitation at the time tP the intensity of the emit-<br>
ted luminescence light decreases according to a certain principle.<br>
[0072] With the help of the spectrometer 30 the luminescence light emanating from<br>
the bank notes BN perpendicularly, i.e. parallel to the excitation light, is now<br>
detected and evaluated. By evaluating the signal of the detector unit 21 at<br>
one or more certain times t2, t3 it can be checked particularly reliably whether<br>
an authentic bank note BN is present, since only the feature substance used<br>
for the bank note BN or the combination of feature substances used has such<br>
a decay behavior. The check of decay behavior can be effected by means of<br>
the above-described comparison of the intensity of the luminescence light at<br>
one or more certain times with given intensities for authentic bank notes BN.<br><br>
It can also be provided that the pattern of intensity of the luminescence light<br>
is compared with given patterns for known bank notes BN.<br><br>

transported at high speed with a luminescence sensor (12),<br>
characterized in that<br>
the value document (BN) to be checked is irradiated to excite luminescence radiation<br>
and the luminescence radiation emanating from the value document (BN) is detected with<br>
spectral resolution, comprising the steps of: transporting the value document (BN) to be<br>
checked past the luminescence sensor (12) in a transport direction (T), and illuminating the<br>
document (BN) with an illumination area (35) which extends in the transport direction (T),<br>
and in that the extension of the illumination area (35) in the transport direction (T) is at<br>
least twice as long as the extension perpendicular to the transport direction (T).<br><br><br><br>
ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR CHECKING<br>
LUMINESCENT VALUE DOCUMENTS<br>
The invention relates to a method and apparatus (1) for checking luminescent value<br>
documents (BN), in particular bank notes, with a luminescence sensor (12). The value<br>
document to be checked is irradiated to excite luminescence radiation, and the luminescence<br>
radiation emanating from the value document is detected with spectral resolution. Since the<br>
value document (BN) to be checked transported past the luminescence sensor (12) in the<br>
transport direction (T) and is illuminated with an illumination area (35) which extends in the<br>
transport direction (T), an effective measurement is possible even of value documents that<br>
emit very little luminescence radiation.</td>
