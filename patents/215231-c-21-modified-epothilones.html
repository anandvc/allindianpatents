COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"C-21 MODIFIED EPOTHILONES"<br>
BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY, a Delaware corporation of P O Box 4000, Princeton, New Jersey 08543-4000, United States of America and GESELLSCHAFT FUR BIOTECHNOLOGISCHE FORSCHUNG MBH[GBF], a German corporation of Mascheroder Weg 1, D-38124 Braunschweig, Germany,<br>

This application claims priority from German applications DE 199 07 588.3, filed February 22, 1999 and DE 199 30 111.5, filed July 1, 1999, incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Epothilone C, R = H D, R = Me<br>
Epothilones are macrocyclic lactones with useful antifungal and cytotoxic properties. Their action, as in the case of TaxolR, is based on stabilization of the microtubuli as a result of which especially tumors and other rapidly dividing cells are inhibited. Typical epothilones carry a methylthiazolyl side chain, a 12,13-double bond (C, D), a 12,13-epoxide (A, B) and a proton (A, C) or a methyl group (B, D) on C-12; compare, for example:  Review Angew.   Chem.   1998, 110,   89-92 and 2120-2153 and Heterocycles 1998, 48,   2485-2488.<br><br><br><br><br>

The compounds of formula I through IV form salts with a variety of organic and inorganic acids.  Such salts include those formed with hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide, methanesulfonic acid, hydroxyethanesulfonic acid, sulfuric acid, acetic acid,<br>
toluenesulfonic acid and various others (e.g. nitrates, phosphates, borates, tartrates, citrates, succinates, benzoates, ascorbates, salicylates and the like).  Such salts are formed by reacting a compound of formula I through IV in an equivalent amount of the acid in a medium in which the salt precipitates or in an aqueous medium followed by evaporation.<br>
In addition, zwitterions ("inner salts") can be formed and are included within the term salts as used herein.<br>
Prodrugs and solvates of the compounds of formula I through IV are also contemplated herein.  The term prodrug, as used herein, denotes a compound which, upon administration to a subject, undergoes chemical conversion by metabolic or chemical processes to yield a compound of formula 1  through IV, or a salt and/or solvate thereof.  For example, compounds of formula I through IV may form a carboxylate ester moiety.  The carboxylate esters are conveniently formed by esterifying any of the carboxylic acid functionalities found on the disclosed ring structure(s).  Solvates of the compounds of formula I through IV are preferably hydrates.<br>

Preparation and Rearrangement of N-Acylepothilone-N-oxides<br>
The production of epothilone-N-oxides (2) (P-Q = epoxide) and their rearrangement to 21-acyloxyepothilone of the following formula 6 has been described in WO 98/38192, the full text of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br><br><br>
(substit.) alkyl-, (substit.) aryl-Sulfonyl (substit.)-Glycosyl<br>
6   R1 = Alkyl, Acyl,<br><br><br>
Scheme 8<br><br><br>
LD0186 (NP)<br>
Scheme 8 can be illustrated as follows (an omitted epothilone core including the -CH= group at position 17 means that this part of the molecule has not been involved in the reaction as illustrated). P-Q represents an epoxide or a C,C double bond, R is a hydrogen atom or a methyl group.<br>
a)	Compounds 3 and 6 can be obtained by reacting compound 2 with R1S02C1 in the presence of a base (R1 = optionally substituted alkyl or optionally substituted aryl).<br>
b)	Compounds 6 and IVa/b can be obtained by reacting compound 2 with an activated carboxylic acid derivative, e.g. carboxylic acid anhydride.<br>
c)	Compound 4 can be obtained by reacting compound IVa/b with a nucleophile NuH or Nu .<br>
The esters 6 are useful intermediate products for a great number of epothilones which have been further modified at position C-21.<br>
For example, if 2 is reacted with for example, acetic anhydride, a new unexpected intermediate compound IV can be found after a short reaction period, whereas IV is completely transformed to 6 after a longer reaction period. If the reaction is interrupted at a proper point in time, IV can be isolated chromatographically as two diastereomers IVa and IVb.<br>
Compounds of type IV have not yet been described. The structure can clearly be derived from their spectroscopical data and their subsequent reactions.<br>
For preparative purposes their reaction with nucleophiles leading to C-21 substituted epothilones 6 is of special importance; Nu = for example carbon-, nitrogen-, oxygen-, sulfur- and halogen-substituents.<br><br><br>
Examples<br>
The following non-limiting examples serve to illustrate the practice of the invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
Conversion of Epothilone B to Epothilone F<br><br>
(i) 1.98 g (3.90 mmol) of Epothilone B was placed under Argon and dissolved in 60 mL dry CH2CI2. To this solution was added 0.720g mCPBA (4.17 mmol, 1.07 equivalents). The mixture was allowed to stir at 25°C for 5.5 hours. The reaction mixture was quenched with 60 mL NaHC03 , and extracted with 3x75 mL of CHCI3. The organic phase was washed with 100 mL water followed by 70 mL of 5% Na2S03(aq) and then 70 mL brine. The organic phase was then dried over Na2S04. The crude reaction product was chromatographed using silica gel eluting with 2% MeOH in CHCI3 to yield 0.976 g of the N-oxide (48%) as a white fluffy solid.<br>
(ii) To a resealable tube under Argon was added 0.976 g of the N-oxide (1.86 mmol) dissolved in 35 mL dry CH2CI2, 2,6-lutidine (1.73 mL, 14.88 mmol, 8 equivalents) and (CF3CO)20  (1.84 mL, 13.02 mmol, 7 equivalents). The tube was sealed and heated at 70°C for 25 min. The mixture was allowed to cool and the solvent was removed under a stream of argon, followed by concentration to a few mL of dark yellow solution under vacuum. The reaction was diluted with 25 mL MeOH and 2.9 mL of 28% NH4OH(aq) was<br><br><br>

The reaction flask was removed from the -78°C cooling bath and stirred at ambient temperature for 15 min.
