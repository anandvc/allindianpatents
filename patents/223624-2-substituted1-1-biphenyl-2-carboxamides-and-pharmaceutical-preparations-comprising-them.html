2'-Substituted 1,1'-biphenyl-2-carboxamides, processes for their preparation, their use as medicament, and pharmaceutical preparations comprising them<br><br>
The compounds of the formula I according to the invention were hitherto unknown. They act on the so-called Kv1.5 potassium channel and inhibit a potassium current described as "ultra-rapidly activating delayed rectifier" in the human atrium. The compounds are therefore very particularly suitable as novel antiarrhythmic active compounds, in particular for the treatment and prophylaxis of atrial arrhythmias, e.g. atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial Flutter.<br>
Atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter are the most frequent persistent cardiac arrhythmias. The occurrence increases with increasing age and frequently leads to fatal sequelae, such as, for example, cerebral apoplexy. AF affects about 1 million Americans annually and leads to more than 30,000 strokes each year in the USA. The presently customary antiarrhythmics of classes I and III, reduce the reoccurrence rate of AF, but because of their potential proarrhythmic side effects only have restricted use. There is therefore a great medical need for the development of better medicaments for the treatment of atrial arrhythmias (S. Mattel, Am. Heart J.<br><br>
130, 1995, 1094-1106; "Newer developments in the management of atrial fibrillation").<br>
It was shown that most supraventricular arrhythmias are subject to so-called "reentry" excitatory waves. Such reentries occur when the cardiac tissue has a slow conductivity and at the same time very short refractory periods. The increasing of the myocardial refractory time by prolongation of the action potential is a recognized mechanism for ending arrhythmias or preventing their formation (T.J. Colatsky et al.. Drug Dev. Res. 19, 1990, 129-140; "Potassium channels as targets for antiarrhythmic drug action"). The length of the action potential is essentially determined by the extent of repolarizing K currents which flow out of the cell via various K"*" channels. Particularly great importance is ascribed here to the so-called "delayed rectifier" IK, which consists of 3 different components: IKr, IKs and IKur-<br>
Most known class III antiarrhythmics (e.g. dofetilide, E4031 and d-sotalol) mainly or exclusively block the rapidly activating potassium channel IKr, which can be detected both in cells of the human ventricle and in the atrium. However, it has been shown that at low or normal heart rates these compounds have an increased proarrhythmic risk, arrhythmias which are described as 'Torsades de pointes" being observed in particular (D. M. Roden, Am. J. Cardiol. 72, 1993, 44B-49B; "Current status of class III antiarrhythmic drug therapy"). In addition to this high, in some cases fatal, risk at low frequency, a decrease in the efficacy under the conditions of tachycardia, in which the action is especially needed, has been found for the iKr blockers ("negative use-dependence").<br>
While some of these disadvantages can possibly be overcome by blockers of the slowly activating components (IKs), their efficacy has hitherto not been confirmed, as no clinical investigations with IKs channel blockers are known.<br>
The "particularly rapidly" activating and very slowly inactivating component of the delayed rectifier IKur (= ultra-rapidly activating delayed rectifier), which corresponds to the Kv1.5 channel, plays a particularly large role in the repolarization period in the human atrium. In comparison to the inhibition of IKr or IKs, inhibition of the IKur potassium outward current is thus a particularly effective method for the prolongation of the atrial action<br><br>
potential and thus for the ending or prevention of atrial arrhythmias. Mathematical models of the human action potential suggest that the positive effect of a blockade of the IKur, especially under the pathological conditions of chronic atrial fibrillation, should be particularly pronounced (M. Courtemanche, R. J. Ramirez, S. Mattel, Cardiovascular Research 1999, 42, 477-489: "Ionic targets for drug therapy and atrial fibrillation-induced electrical remodeling: insights from a mathematical model").<br>
In contrast to IKr and IKs, which also occur in the human ventricle, the IKur admittedly plays an important role in the human atrium, but not in the ventricle. For this reason, on inhibition of the IKur current in contrast to the blockade of IKr or IKs, the risk of a proarrhythmic action on the ventricle is excluded from the start (Z. Wang et al., Circ. Res. 73, 1993, 1061-1076: "Sustained Depolarisation-lnduced Outward Current in Human Atrial Myocytes"; G.-R. Li et al, Circ. Res. 78, 1996, 689 - 696: "Evidence for Two Components of Delayed Rectifier K Current in Human Ventricular Myocytes"; G. J. Amos et al., J. Physiol. 491, 1996, 31-50: "Differences between outward currents of human atrial and subepicardial ventricular myocytes").<br>
Antiarrhythmics which act via a selective blockade of the IKur current or Kvl .5 channel were previously not available, however, on the market. For numerous pharmaceutical active compounds (e.g. tedisamil, bupivacaine or sertindole), a blocking action on the Kvl .5 channel was admittedly described, but the Kvl .5 blockade here in each case represents only a side effect next to other principal actions of the substances.<br>
WO 98 04 521 claims aminoindans as potassium channel blockers which block the Kvl .5 channel. The applications WO 9818 475 and WO 98 18 476 claim the use of various pyridazinones and phosphine oxides as antiarrhythmics, which should act via a blockade of the IKur-However, the same compounds were originally also described as immuno¬suppressants (WO 96 25 936). The compounds described in these mentioned applications are structurally completely different to the compounds according to the invention of this application.<br>
It has now surprisingly been found that the 2'-substituted 1,1'-biphenyl-2-carboxamides described here are potent blockers of the human Kvl .5<br><br>
channel. They can therefore be used as novel antiarrhythmics having a particularly advantageous safety profile. In particular, the connpounds are suitable for the treatment of supraventricular arrhythmias, e.g. atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter.<br>
The compounds can be employed for the termination of existing atrial fibrillation or flutters for re-establishing the sinus rhythm (cardioversion). Moreover, the substances reduce the susceptibility to the formation of new flutter events (retention of the sinus rhythm, prophylaxis).<br>
The compounds according to the invention were previously unknown. Some structurally related compounds are described in Helv. Chim. Acta 1994 (70) 70 and references cited there. For the peptide compounds described there (e.g. compound A), however, no potassium channel-blocking activity is known. Moreover, compounds of this type should have too low a metabolic stability for use as antiarrhythmics on account of the numerous peptide bonds.<br><br>
A further similar compound (compound B) is mentioned in European Patent Application EP 0620216. The compound B and all other compounds of this application carry, in the position of R(3), a specific substituent (e.g. benzoyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline), which is not included in the compounds according to the invention of this application. The compounds mentioned in EP 0 620 216 act as vasopressin antagonists and thus have a completely different biological activity to the blockers of the Kv1.5 channel described here.<br><br><br><br>

Alkyl radicals and alkylene radicals can be straight-chain or branched. This also applies to the alkylene radicals of the formulae CxH2x, CyHay, CzH2z, CvH2v and CwH2w- Alkyl radicals and alkylene radicals can also be straight-chain or branched if they are substituted or are contained in other radicals, e.g. in an aikoxy radical or in a fluorinated alkyl radical. Examples of alkyl radicals are methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl, isopentyl, neopentyl, n-hexyl, 3,3-dimethyl-butyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl, dodecyl, tridecyl, tetradecyl, pentadecyl, hexadecyl, heptadecyl, octadecyl, nonadecyl, eicosyl. The divalent radicals derived from these radicals, e.g. methylene, 1,1-ethylene, 1,2-ethylene, 1,1-propylene, 1,2-propylene, 2,2-propylene, 1,3-propylene, 1,1-butylene, 1,4-butylene, 1,5-pentylene, 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-propylene, 1,6-hexylene, etc., are examples of alkylene radicals.<br>
Cycloalkyl radicals can likewise be branched. Examples of cycloalkyl radicals having 3 to 11 carbon atoms are cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, 1-methyl-cyclopropyl, 2-methylcyclopropyl, cyclopentyl, 2-methylcyclobutyl, 3-methyl-cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, 2-methylcyclohexyl, 3-methylcyclohexyl, 4-methylcyclohexyl, menthyl, cycloheptyl, cyclooctyl etc.<br>
N-containing heteroaromatics having 1,2,3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9 carbon atoms are considered in particular as 1-, 2- or 3-pyrrolyl, 1-, 2-, 4- or 5-imidazolyl, 1-, 3-, 4- or 5-pyrazolyl, 1,2,3-triazol-1-, -4- or -5-yl, 1,2,4-triazol-1-, -3- or -5-yl, 1- or 5-tetrazolyl, 2-, 4- or 5-oxazolyl, 3-, 4- or 5-isoxazolyl, 1,2,3-oxadiazol-4- or -5-yl, 1,2,4-oxadiazol-3- or -5-yl, 1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl or -5-yl, 2-, 4- or 5-thiazolyl, 3-, 4- or 5-isothiazolyl, 1,3,4-thiadiazol-2- or -5-yl, 1,2,4-thiadiazol-3- or -5-yl, 1,2,3-thiadiazol-4- or -5-yl, 2-, 3- or 4-pyridyl, 2-, 4-, 5- or 6-pyrimidinyl, 3- or 4-pyridazinyl, pyrazinyl, 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6- or 7-indolyl, 1-, 2-, 4- or 5-benzimidazolyl, 1-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6- or 7-indazolyl, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7- or 8-quinolyl, 1-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7- or 8-isoquinolyl, 2-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7- or 8-quinazolinyl, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7- or 8-cinnolinyl, 2-, 3-, 5-, 6-, 7- or 8-quinoxalinyl, 1-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7- or 8-phtha!azinyl. The corresponding N-oxides of these compounds are furthermore included, i.e., for example, 1-oxy-2-, -3- or-4-pyridyl.<br>
The N-containing heterocycles pyrrolyl, imidazolyl, quinolyl, pyrazolyl, pyridyl, pyrazinyl, pyrimidinyl and pyridazinyl are particularly preferred.<br><br>
Pyridyl is either 2-, 3- or 4-pyridyl. Tliienyl is either 2- or 3-thienyl. Furyl is either 2- or 3-furyl.<br>
IVIonosubstituted phenyl radicals can be substituted in the 2, 3 or 4 position, disubstituted in the 2,3, 2,4, 2,5, 2,6, 3,4 or 3,5 position, or trisubstituted in the 2,3,4, 2,3,5, 2,3,6, 2,4,5, 2,4,6 or 3,4,5 position. The same correspondingly also applies analogously to the N-containing hetero-aromatics, the thiophene or the furyl radical.<br>
If a radical is di- or trisubstituted, the substituents can be identical or different.<br>
If R(3) and R(4) are together a chain of 4 or 5 methylene groups, of which one methylene group can be replaced by -0-, -S-, -NH- etc., then these radicals together with the nitrogen atom of the formula I form a 5- or 6-membered nitrogen heterocycle, such as, for example, pyrrolidine, piperidine, morpholine, thiomorpholine etc.<br>
If the compounds of the formula I contain one or more acidic or basic groups or one or more basic heterocycles, the invention also includes the corresponding physiologically or toxicologically tolerable salts, in particular the pharmaceutically utilizable salts. Thus the compounds of the formula I which carry acidic groups, e.g. one or more COOH groups, for example as alkali metal salts, preferably sodium or potassium salts, or as alkaline earth metal salts, e.g. calcium or magnesium salts, or as ammonium salts, e.g. as salts with ammonia or organic amines or amino acids, can be used. Compounds of the formula I which carry one or more basic, i.e. protonatable, groups or contain one or more basic heterocyclic rings can also be used in the form of their physiologically tolerable acid addition salts with inorganic or organic acids, for example as hydrochlorides, phosphates, sulfates, methanesulfonates, acetates, lactates, maleates, fumarates, malates, gluconates etc. If the compounds of the formula I simultaneously contain acidic and basic groups in the molecule, the invention also includes internal salts, so-called betaines, in addition to the salt forms described. Salts can be obtained from the compounds of the formula I according to customary processes, for example by combination with an acid or base in a solvent or dispersant or alternatively from other salts by anion exchange.<br><br>
If they are appropriately substituted, the compounds of the formula I can be present in stereoisomeric forms. If the compounds of the formula I contain one or more asymmetric centers, these independently of one another can have the S configuration or the R configuration. The invention includes all possible stereoisomers, e.g. enantiomers or dlastereomers, and mixtures of two or more stereoisomeric forms, e.g. enantiomers and/or dlastereomers, in any desired ratios. The invention thus includes enantiomers, for example, in enantiomerically pure form, both as levo- and as dextrorotatory antipodes, and also in the form of mixtures of the two enantiomers in different ratios or in the form of racemates. If desired, the individual stereoisomers can be prepared by resolution of a mixture according to customary methods or, for example, by stereoselective synthesis. If mobile hydrogen atoms are present, the present invention also comprises all tautomeric forms of the compounds of the formula I.<br>
The compounds of the formula I can be prepared by different chemical processes, which are likewise included in the present invention. Some typical routes are outlined in the reaction sequences designated below as schemes 1, 2, 3 and 4. The radicals R(1) to R(8) used here are in each case defined as indicated above, if not stated othenwise below.<br>
Thus a compound of the formula I according to scheme 1 is obtained, for example, starting from diphenic anhydride derivatives of the formula II as precursors which are commercially obtainable or known from the literature. Reduction of the compounds II using sodium borohydride followed by reaction with potassium phthalimide as described in Tetrahedron 45 (1989) 1365-1376 ylelds the biphenylcarboxylic acids of the formula IV. By coupling with amines of the formula HNR(3)R(4) followed by hydrazinolysis of the phthalimide, the aminomethyl compounds of the formula VI are obtained, from which, by reaction with suitable derivatives of the formula R(1)-X, the compounds of the formula I according to the invention are obtained in which R(2) is hydrogen and R(1), R(3), R(4), R(5), R(6), R(7) and R(8) have the meanings indicated above. Subsequent alkylation using suitable alkylating agents of the formula R(2)Y, in which Y is a nucleofugic leaving group, e.g. CI, Br or I, ylelds the corresponding compounds of the formula I in which R(2) is alkyl having 1 to 4 carbon atoms.<br>
Alternatively, the biphenylcarboxylic acids of the formula IV can also be<br><br>
converted by hydrazinolysis to the aminocarboxylic acids of the formula VII which are then converted by reaction of the amino group with compounds of the formulae R(1)-X and R(2)-Y followed by amidation of the carboxylic acids with amines of the formula HNR(3)R(4) to give compounds of the formula I according to the invention (scheme 2).<br>
In some cases, it can be useful to first prepare compounds of the formula la (scheme 3) in which R(9) is an easily removable radical, such as, for example, tert-butyl or benzyl, by one of the previously mentioned methods. After removal of the corresponding protective group, e.g. with trifluoroacetic acid for the Boc group or by catalytic hydrogenation for the benzyloxy-carbonyl radical, the compounds of the formula IX are obtained, which can then in turn be converted into other compounds of the formula I according to the invention by reaction with compounds of the formula R(1)-X.<br>
Another possibility ■ for the preparation of compounds according to the invention consists in the palladium-catalyzed coupling of a phenyl bromide or iodide of the formula X with a phenylboronic acid of the formula XI (Suzuki coupling; scheme 4), which can be carried out, for example, in the presence of Pd[(PPh)3]4 as a catalyst, sodium carbonate as a base and 1,2-dimethoxyethane as a solvent. If R(9) is an easily removable radical, such as, for example, tert-butyl or benzyl, the compounds of the formula lb can then be converted into other compounds of the formula I according to the invention as described above and in scheme 3.<br>
The required boronic acids of the formula XI can be obtained from the compounds of the formula XII, in which Z is hydrogen, bromine or iodine, by ortholithiation or metal-halogen exchange followed by reaction with trimethyl borate.<br>
The abovementioned reactions of the compounds of the formulae VI, VII and IX with compounds of the formula R(1)-X correspond to the known conversion of an amine to a carboxamide, sulfonamide, carbamate, urea or thiourea derivative. The radical X here is a suitable nucleofugic leaving group, such as, for example, F, CI, Br, imidazole, 0-succinimide etc.<br>
For the preparation of compounds of the formula I or VIII in which R(1) is C(0)0R(9),   i.e.   carbamates,   compounds  of  the  formula   R(1)-X,   for<br><br>
example, are used in which X is chlorine or O-succinimide, i.e. chloroformates or succinimidocarbonates.<br>
For the preparation of compounds of the formula I or VIII in which R(1) is SO2R(10), i.e. sulfonamides, as a rule compounds of the formula R(1)-X are used in which X is chlorine, i.e. sulfonyl chlorides.<br>
For the preparation of compounds of the formula I or VIII in which R(1) is COR(II), i.e. carboxamides, compounds of the formula R(1)-X, for example, are used in which X is chlorine, imidazole or acetoxy, i.e. carbonyl chlorides, carboxylic acid imidazolides or mixed anhydrides. However, the free acids of the formula R(1)-0H can also be used in the presence of suitable condensing agents such as carbodiimides or uronium salts such as TOTU.<br>
For the preparation of compounds of the formula I or VIM in which R(1) is CONR(12)R(13) or C(S)NR(12)R(13), i.e. ureas or thioureas, Instead of the compounds of the formula R(1)-X it is also possible to use compounds of the formula R(12)N(=C=0), or R(12)N(=C=S), i.e. isocyanates or isothiocyanates.<br>
The abovementioned reactions of the compounds of the formulae IV or VIII with amines of the formula HNR(3)R(4) correspond to the known conversion of a carboxylic acid to a carboxamide. Numerous methods have been described in the literature for carrylng out these reactions. They can be carried out particularly advantageously by activation of the carboxylic acid, e.g. with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), if appropriate with addition of hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT) or dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP), or with 0-[(cyano(ethoxycarbonyl)methylene)amino]-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TOTU). However, reactive acid derivatives can also be synthesized first according to known methods, e.g. acid chlorides by reaction of the carboxylic acids of the formula IV or VIII with inorganic acid halides, such as, for example, SOCI2, or acid imidazolides by reaction with carbonyldiimidazole, which are then reacted with the amines of the formula HNR(3)R(4), if appropriate with the addition of an auxiliary base.<br>
In all procedures, it may be appropriate to temporarily protect functional groups in the molecule in certain reaction steps. Such protective group<br><br>
techniques are familiar to the person skilled in the art. The choice of a protective group for groups under consideration and the processes for their introduction and removal are described in the literature and can if necessary be adapted to the individual case without difficulties.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
their physiologically tolerable salts for use as pharmaceuticals, their use in the therapy and prophylaxis of the syndromes mentioned and their use for the production of medicaments therefor and of medicaments having K" channel-blocking action. The present invention furthermore relates to pharmaceutical preparations which, as active constituent, contain an efficacious dose of at least one compound of the formula I and/or of a physiologically tolerable salt thereof in addition to customary, pharmaceutically innocuous vehicles and excipients. The pharmaceutical preparations normally contain 0.1 to 90% by weight of the compounds of the formula I and/or their physiologically tolerable salts. The pharmaceutical preparations can be prepared in a manner known per se. To this end, the compounds of the formula I and/or their physiologically tolerable salts are brought, together with one or more solid or liquid pharmaceutical vehicles and/or excipients and, if desired, in combination with other pharmaceutical active compounds, into a suitable administration form or dose form, which can then be used as a pharmaceutical in human medicine or veterinary medicine.<br>
Pharmaceuticals which contain compounds of the formula I according to the invention and/or their physiologically tolerable salts can be administered orally, parenterally, e.g. intravenously, rectally, by inhalation or topically, the preferred administration being dependent on the individual case, e.g. the particular form of the disease to be treated.<br>
The person skilled in the art is familiar on the basis of his/her expert knowledge with which excipients are suitable for the desired pharma¬ceutical formulation. In addition to solvents, gel-forming agents, suppository bases, tablet excipients and other active compound carriers, it is possible to use, for example, antioxidants, dispersants, emulsifiers, antifoams, flavor corrigents, preservatives, solubilizers, agents for achieving a depot effect, buffer substances or colorants.<br>
For the obtainment of an advantageous therapeutic action, the compounds of the formula I can also be combined with other pharmaceutical active compounds. Thus in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases advanta¬geous combinations with substances having cardiovascular activity are possible. Possible combination partners of this type which are advanta¬geous for cardiovascular disorders are, for example, other antiarrhythmics.<br><br>
i.e. class I, class II or class III antiarrhythmics, such as, for example, IKs or IKr channel blockers, e.g. dofetilide, or furthermore hypotensive substances such as ACE inhibitors (for example enalapril, captopril, ramipril), angiotensin antagonists, K channel activators, and also alpha- and beta-receptor blockers, but also sympathomimetic compounds and compounds having adrenergic activity, as well as Na /H exchange inhibitors, calcium channel antagonists, phosphodiesterase inhibitors and other substances having a positive inotropic action, such as, for example, digitalis glycosides, or diuretics.<br>
For an oral administration form, the active compounds are mixed with the additives suitable therefor, such as vehicles, stabilizers or inert diluents, and brought by the customary methods into the suitable administration forms, such as tablets, coated tablets, hard gelatin capsules, aqueous, alcoholic or oily solutions. Inert carriers which can be used are, for example, gum arable, magnesia, magnesium carbonate, potassium phosphate, lactose, glucose or starch, in particular cornstarch. In this case, preparation can be carried out both as dry and as moist granules. Suitable oily vehicles or solvents are, for example, vegetable or animal oils, such as sunflower oil or cod-liver oil. Suitable solvents for aqueous or alcoholic solutions are, for example, water, ethanol or sugar solutions or mixtures thereof. Further excipients, also for other administration forms, are, for example, polyethylene glycols and polypropylene glycols.<br>
For subcutaneous or intravenous administration, the active compounds, if desired with the substances customary therefor such as solubilizers, emulsifiers or further excipients, are brought into solution, suspension or emulsion. The compounds of the formula I and their physiologically tolerable salts can also be lyophilized and the lyophilizates obtained used, for example, for the production of injection or infusion preparations. Suitable solvents are, for example, water, physiological saline solution or alcohols, e.g. ethanol, propanol, glycerol, and in addition also sugar solutions such as glucose or mannitol solutions, or alternatively mixtures of the various solvents mentioned.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutical formulations for administration in the form of aerosols or sprays are, for example, solutions, suspensions or emulsions of the active compounds of the formula I or their physiologically tolerable salts<br><br>
in a pharmaceutically acceptable solvent, such as, In particular, ethanol or water, or a mixture of such solvents. If required, the formulation can also contain other pharmaceutical excipients such as surfactants, emulsifiers and stabilizers, and a propellant. Such a preparation contains the active compound customarily in a concentration of approximately 0.1 to 10, in particular of approximately 0.3 to 3, percent by weight.<br>
The dose of the active compound of the formula I or of the physiologically tolerable salts thereof to be administered depends on the individual case and is to be adjusted to the conditions of the individual case as customary for an optimum action. Thus it depends, of course, on the frequency of administration and on the potency and duration of action of the compounds in each case employed for therapy or prophylaxis, but also on the nature and severity of the illness to be treated and on sex, age, weight and individual responsiveness of the human or animal to be treated and on whether treatment is acute or prophylactic. Customarily, the daily dose of a compound of the formula I on administration to a patient weighing approximately 75 kg is 0.001 mg/kg of body weight to 100 mg/kg of body weight, preferably 0.01 mg/kg of body weight to 20 mg/kg of body weight. The dose can be administered in the form of an individual dose or can be divided into two or more, e.g. 2, 3 or 4, individual doses. In particular in the treatment of acute cases of cardiac arrhythmias, for example in an intensive care unit, parenteral administration by injection or infusion, e.g. by an intravenous continuous infusion, can also be advantageous.<br>
