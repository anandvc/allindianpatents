Lap trolley is indicated by reference numeral TR in fig.l. The Lap trolley is capable of holding up to 4 laps as they are ejected at the end of lap build up. Soon after completion of the doffing cycle, the trolley is indexed and positioned appropriately to receive the next ejected lap thereon. Once this trolley is loaded with four laps, another trolley takes place to receive further laps. The loaded trolley is moved and attached to the comber for further processing.<br>
Transfer of lap package from the lap trolley to the comber is effected by a simple and cost effective transfer arrangement, which is illustrated in Fig. 14 of the accompanying drawings.<br>
Lap holding zone of the lap trolley has a fixed beam ( 99 ) and a swing able front beam ( 100 ).Supports ( 101 and 102 ) are rigidly fixed at the bottom of the front beam ( 100 ).

One end of the lap lock lever (106) is pivoted to the lever link pin (105) and the other end is pivoted to the side wall of the lap trolley. One end of the gas spring (107) is hinged to the support (102) and the other end hinged to the side wall of the lap trolley. Similar arrangement is provided on the other end.<br><br>
The lap (L) rests partially on the fixed beam ( 99 ) and partially on the front beam ( 100). The load exerted by the lap (L) on the front beam acts on the lever link pin (105) which rests at the top most position of the radial slot provided in the side wall of the lap trolley.<br>
For the transfer of the lap from the trolley to the comber, an actuating mechanism ( not shown ) in the comber momentarily lifts the lap lock lever (106) provided on both sides of the lap trolley simultaneously in the upward direction. This causes the lever link pin ( 105) along with the lap lock (103) to slide in the radial slot resulting in the swinging of the front beam. The lap (L) get released from the front beam and get deposited on to the combing heads of the comber. Soon after , the pressure exerted by the gas spring (107) lifts the front beam (100) to its home position.<br>
Obvious alterations and modifications known to persons skilled in the art are not excluded from the scope of this invention and the appended claims.<br><br>
