				<td>METHOD, SYSTEM, CLIENT AND SERVER FOR CREATING<br>
USER INFORMATION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a field of communications, and more specifically, relates to a method for creating user information, a system for creating user information and a client and server in the system.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
In an existing network environment, users of various Instant Messaging tools, Network Forums, Communities, Games and etc., may edit and publish their own user information so as to make the contact and understanding among various users convenient. Taking Instant Messaging for example, contents of the user information generally include: an avatar, a nick name, an account number, a level mark, the latest space content, shop information, a service icon, a geological location and etc. The above contents are all default items of the user information in an instant messaging tool, and the user usually only has the right to indicate whether he agrees to present these contents, however, he is unable to extend the contents of the user information.<br>
From the above, it can be understood that the contents of various kinds of user information are configured and presented according to system-default appearance and items in the prior art, and the extensibility of the user information's contents is too low to satisfy the user's personalized demands. In addition, all contacts of a user have the same access right to the user's information because the user is unable to control opening of his information, so that the pertinence of the opening of the information is low, and the access to the user information in the prior art mainly relies on the Instant Messaging so the access mode thereof is simplex.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
To solve the above problem, the present invention provides a method and system for creating user information, and also provides a client and server in the system, in order to increase the extensibility of the contents of the user information to satisfy the personalized demands of users.<br><br>
A client described in the embodiments of the present invention, includes; an information editing module, adapted to extend patterns of user information and edit the user information according to the extended patterns of the user information; and a transceiver, adapted to upload to a server the user information edited by the information editing module.<br>
A server described in the embodiments of the present invention, includes: a transceiver, adapted to receive user information uploaded by a client; a data processing module, adapted to classify the user information received by the transceiver from the client to obtain pattern information and content information; and a database, adapted to store the pattern information and the content information as different classifications.<br>
A system for creating user information described in the embodiments of the present invention includes; at least one above-mentioned client and at least one above-mentioned server.<br>
A method for creating user information in a client described in the embodiments of the present invention includes: extending patterns of user information according to a user's instruction; editing the user information of the user according to contents of the user information input by the user; and uploading the edited user information to a server.<br>
A method for creating user information in a server described in the embodiments of the present invention includes: receiving user information uploaded by a client; and classifying the user information uploaded by the client which is received via a transceiver and storing the user information.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the extensibility of the contents is enhanced so that the user's personalized demands are satisfied by self-defming patterns being extended in the client and editing the user information according to the extended patterns. The present invention is not only applied to Instant Messaging, Online Games and Network Forums, but also applied to other similar network environments, where, the personalized user information can be shared, distributed, posted and etc. by means of Instant Messaging, E-mails, Web-pages and so on, so that the variability of the user information's opening mode is raised.<br>

Embodiments of the Invention<br>
In order to make objects, technical solutions and advantages of the present invention more clear, the present invention is further described in details together with the accompanying drawings and embodiments hereinafter. It should be understood that the specific embodiments described herein are only used to interpret but not limit the present invention.<br>
In accordance the with embodiments of the present invention, to improve the extensibility of the user information's contents and satisfy the user's personalized demands, the user information's patterns, including appearance, items and etc., are extended in a client, corresponding contents are input according to the extended patterns of the user information, and data of the user information having been edited are uploaded to a server, and at the same time, the having-been-edited data of the user information may further be backed up in local.<br>
When a user views a user's user information, the user that views the user information of another user obtains data of another user's user information from the server, and a user<br><br>
information card is generated and displayed in a local client.<br>
if a user lias backed up his user information in local, data of the backed-up user information ma) be retrieved locally and a user information card may be generated and displayed in a client when the user views his user information.<br>
In accordance with the embodiments of the present invention, the patterns of the user information have a strong extensibility, so that the user's personalized demands are fully satisfied. Specifically, the user may view the self-defined appearance and items of the extended user information via the client, and thus, the appearance and contents of the user information card finally being viewed can be very plentiful.<br>
Figure I shows a structure of a system for creating user information in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in Figure 1, the system includes sever 100 and at least one client, e.g., client 200, client 300, ..., client N. • It should be noted that connection relationships among devices shown in all the figures of the present invention are used to interpret information interactions and controlling processes among them, and therefore, shall be regarded as logical connection relationships but not limited to physical connections.<br>
In Figure I, server 100 connects with the clients (client 200, client 300, ..., client N) and is adapted to receive and store data of user information reported by each client, process the data of the user information according to requests of different clients and give feedbacks.<br>
The clients (client 200, client 300, ..., client N) may be various terminal commiinication devices, e.g., a PC (Persona! Computer), a PDA (Personal Digital Assistant), a MP (Mobile Phone), various WCs (Web clients) or etc. And thus, the protection of the present invention shall not be limited to a particular type of client.<br>
Figure 2 shows a system structure for presenting user information in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The system structure is not the simplest one in accordance with the present invention, and can be further extended. The system structure is a typical one applied in network environments and includes server 100, client 200 and client 300.<br>
Figure 3 shows an internal structure of a client in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in Figure 3, the client includes information editing module 201, storage module 202, transceiver 203 and analyzing and drawing module 204, wherein,<br><br>
(1) Jntbrmation editing module 201. being connected uith storage module 202 and iranscei\ er 203. is adapted to extend patterns of user information according to a user's instruction and edit the user information input by the user according to the patterns extended. Inside information editing module 201, there are pattern extending unit 2011, content editing unit 2012 and right defining unit 2013. Wherein, pattern extending unit 2011 is adapted to extend the patterns of the user information according to the user's instruction, the patterns said in the embodiments of the present invention including appearance and items that the user desires to present and etc.; content editing unit 2012 is adapted to edit contents of the user information according to the patterns extended by pattern extending unit 2011 and the user information input by the user; and, right defining unit 2013 is adapted to define rights according to the user information edited by pattern extending unit 2011 and configure opening levels of the user information.<br>
For example, in a demonstrative solution of the present invention, a user desires to present his personal information in a new appearance, e.g., a self-designed appearance of ■'Micky Mice" Shape, and the user may select adding a self-defined appearance in the user information's patterns provided by pattern extending unit 2011, select locally the appearance of "Micky Mice" Shape which is self-designed by the user and upload it. And thus, pattern extending unit 2011 may e.xtend the appearance of the local user information according to the user's instruction and the appearance of "Micky Mice" Shape uploaded by the user. Besides, when the user desires to add some self-defined items in his personal information, e.g., add information related to his pet dog, the user may select adding self-defined items in the items provided by pattern extending unit 20II, i.e., items related to the pet dog, e.g., the pet dog's name, age, weight, favorite food and etc. The presentation form of the extended self-defined items may be self-defined by the user, e.g., may be extended on the basis of the model of the system's original patterns, or may be a newly-created model acting as a sub-card of the user's own personal information card (i.e.. a new information card). And therefore, pattern extending unit 2011 may extend the items of the user's user information according to the user's instruction. After that, the user inputs corresponding contents via content editing unit 2012 according to the extended items, e.g., "Name: Casio", "Age; One year old", "Weight: 2.5 kilograms", "Favorite food: Ham" and etc., and the above contents can be input by the user arbitrarily. And then, the opening levels of the edited information can be defined in right defining unit 2013 after all the information has been edited, e.g., choose to open all to family, tick part of the<br><br>
items for opening to schoolmates, choose to open nothing to some persons, and the opening le\els can be defined b) the user arbitrarily. Through the above procedure, the user information having the self-defined appearance of "K4icky Mice" Shape as well as information related to the pet dog is thus created.<br>
In another example of the present invention, a user desires to add into the personal information his information when acting as a "Game Player" in a game, and then pattern extending unit 2011 may extend items related to "Game Player" according to the instruction input by the user, the items may include "Player Name", "Adept Weapon", "Unique Skill", "Mouse Speed", "Screen Resolution", "Best Grade" and etc. The items may be self-defined by the user, and may be extended on the basis of the model of the system's original patterns or may be a newly-created model acting as a sub-card of the user's own personal information card (i.e., a new information card). And then, content editing module 2012 further edits the user's user information according to the corresponding contents that the user inputs to the extended items, e.g., "Player Name: Crayon Xiaohui", "Adept Weapon: Flying Knife", "Unique Skill: Shift between Heaven and Earth", "Mouse Speed: 2.8", "Screen Resolution: 640*480", "Best Grade: 2006WCG" and etc. Right defining unit 2013 may further define opening levels for the edited information according to the user's defmition after all the user information has been edited, e.g., only open to other game players in this online game. The opening levels can be defined by the user arbitrarily. Through the above procedure, the user can create the self-defined user information having certain game player's information.<br>
(2)	Storage module 202, being connected with information editing module 201 and<br>
analyzing and drawing module 204, is adapted to back up the user information edited by<br>
information editing module 201 which is provided for analyzing and drawing module<br>
204"s locally retrieving.<br>
in a demonstrative solution of the present invention, storage module 202 includes multiple different storage units, e.g., an appearance storing unit, an item storing unit, a right storing unit and etc., (which are not shown in Figure 3), and is adapted to store data of the user information edited by information editing module 201 after classification, e.g., the data are stored as pattern data, content data, right data and etc.<br>
(3)	Transceiver 203, being connected with information editing module 201 and<br>
analyzing and drawing module 204, is adapted to upload to server 100 the data of the user<br>
information  edited  by  information  editing  module  201,  receive  various  messages.<br><br>
instructions or data sent from ser\ er 100, and transmit these messages, instructions or data to anal\zing and drawing module 204 for processing.<br>
In a demonstrative solution of the present invention, a user logging on client 200 uploads the edited information to server 100 and backs up the information in local, and then initiates a request for viewing his own information which is sent to server 100 by transceiver 203; and server 100 feeds back an instruction of "retrieving locally" after determination, and transceiver 203 receives the instruction and forwards it to analyzing and drawing module 204 for processing.<br>
In another demonstrative solution of the present invention, a user logging on client 200 sends a request for viewing another user's user information which is sent to server 100 by transceiver 203; and server 100 retrieves the user information uploaded by the user being queried and feeds it back to transceiver 203 in the client, and transceiver 203 receives the user information of the user being queried and forwards it to analyzing and drawing module 204 for processing.<br>
(4) Analyzing and drawing module 204, being connected with storage module 202 and transceiver 203, is adapted to analyze the data of the user information according to messages, instructions or data fed back by server 100, generate a user information card of the user according to the pattern data, content data and right data in the data of the user information, and display the user information card to the user.<br>
The user information card generated by analyzing and drawing module 204 may be in multiple forms, e.g., a graphic interface or in a form of webpage. The former may be directly analyzed into graphics and the latter may typically be used to generate a webpage link via which a webpage containing the user information is accessed.<br>
In a demonstrative solution, analyzing and drawing module 204 retrieves the backed-up data of the user information and generates a user information card for displaying if server 100 feeds back an instruction of obtaining the user information locally (indicating that the user initiated a request for viewing his own information).<br>
In another demonstrative solution, if server 100 feeds back a data packet of a web-user"s information, analyzing and drawing module 204 analyzes the data packet and generates a corresponding user information card for displaying according to the data of the web-user's information obtained by the analyzing.<br>
Client 300 and client 200 are in an opposite relationship in specific network applications, the internal structures and functionalities of the two are identical, and<br><br>
therefore, those of client 300 are not be described herein.<br>
It should be described that in another embodiment of the present invention, the client may not include storage module 202, i.e., the client does not have the function of backing up user information in local. At this time, when a user queries his own user information, the user still needs to download data of his user information from server 100. Likewise, in this case, server 100 does not need to determine whether a client requests its own user information upon receiving from the client a querying request but need to directly feed back the user information uploaded by the user.<br>
Server 100 in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention includes database 101, transceiver 102 and data processing module 103, and the specific internal structure of server 100 is as shown in Figure 4, wherein,<br>
(!) Database 101 is adapted to store the data of the user information uploaded by client 200 and client 300 after classification. Database 101 includes pattern storage unit 1011, content storage unit 1012 and attached-information unit 1013, wherein, pattern storage unit 1011 is adapted to store pattern information in the data of the user information which includes appearance and items that the user desires to present; content storage unit 1012 is adapted to store content information in the data of the user information, e.g., the contents input by content editing unit 2012 according to the extended patterns; and, attached-information unit 1013 is adapted to store right information defined by the user, e.g., opening levels defined for the user information and etc.<br>
(2) Transceiver 102, being connected with database 101 and data processing module 103, is adapted to receive the data of the user information uploaded by clients 200 and 300 and viewing requests transmitted by clients 200 and 300 and etc., and feed back corresponding messages, instructions or data according to processing results of data processing module 103.<br>
(3) Data processing module 103 is adapted to classify the data of the user information uploaded by clients 200 and 300, store the classified data in the storage units in database 101, retrieve the user information of the user being queried from database 101 when receiving a viewing request from a client, and feed back the retrieved user information to the client sending the request.<br>
In addition, when the client includes the storage module, data processing module 103 may  further  analyze  the  received   reviewing  request,  determine  whether the client<br><br>
initiating the request (calied ihe requesting client for short) is identical with the one being requested for viewing (called the requested client for short), feed back to the requesting client via the transceiver the instruction of obtaining the user information locally if it is determined that the requesting client is identical with the requested client, and otherwise, retrieve from database 101 the data of the user information and feed back the data to the requesting client via the transceiver.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention also provide a method for creating and querying user information. Figure 5 shows a procedure of the method for creating and querying user information in accordance with the embodiments of the present invention, the method is based on the system structure shown in Figure 2, where, different users respectively log on client 200 and client 300, and the specific procedure of the method is as follows:<br>
In step S501, client 200 extends patterns of user information according to an instruction of a user, edits contents of the user information input by the user according to the extended patterns. Wherein, the patterns mentioned in the embodimenls of the present invention include appearance and items that the user desires to present and etc.<br>
Step S501 specifically includes:<br>
(1)	Extending the appearance of the user information;<br>
(2)	Extending the items of the user information; and,<br>
(3)	Editing the contents of the user information input by the user according to the extended items.<br>
In step S502, client 200 uploads data of the edited user information to server 100 via transceiver 203.<br>
Creation of the user's self-defined user information can be realized via the above steps S50I andS502.<br>
In step S503, the requesting client obtains the data of the user information when a user in the network initiates a request for viewing the user information on client 200, where, the requesting client in the present invention may be client 200 or 300.<br>
In step S504, the requesting client (client 200 or 300) presents the user information on a u.ser interface according to the obtained data of the user information, where, there are multiple forms of presentation in the present invention, and the user information may be generated as a user information card. The user information card generated by analyzing and drawing module 204 or 304 in the present invention may be in multiple forms, e.g.,<br><br>
mav be a graphic interface or in a webpage form. The former may be directly analvzed into graphics and the laner ma}- typicall}' be used to generate a webpage link via which a webpage containing the user information is accessed.<br>
Query of the user's self-defined user information can be realized via the above steps S503 and S504.<br>
Figure 6 shows a procedure of a method for creating and querying user information in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the method is based on the system structure shown in Figure 2, where, user A logs on client 200, user B logs on client 300, and the specific procedure of the method is as follows:<br>
in step S60], information of user A is edited according to the extended patterns in client 200, and the patterns include appearance and items that user A desires to present. It specifically includes: (1) extending the appearance of the user information, (2) extending the items of the user information, and (3) inputting corresponding contents according to the extended items.<br>
For example, in a demonstrative solution, the appearance may be self-designed by user A, e.g., "Micky Mice" Shape or etc. The extended items may be self-defined by user A, e.g., information related to a pet dog of user A is extended as "Name: Casio", "Age: One year old", "Weight: 2.5 kilograms", "Favorite food: Ham" and etc. In step S601, the opening levels for user A"s informiation may be further defined, e.g., choose to open all to family, tick part of the items for opening to schoolmates, choose to open nothing to some persons, and etc.<br>
In step S602. client 200 uploads to server 100 data of the edited user A's information via transceiver 203, and backs up the data in client 200.<br>
Transceiver 102 in server 100 classifies the data of user A's information via data processing module 103 after receiving the data of user A's information, and stores the classified data in respective storage units of database 101. In a demonstrative solution, pattern information is stored in pattern storage unit 1011, content information is stored in content storage unit 1012, and opening levels for user A's information is stored in attached-information unit 1013.<br>
In a demonstrative solution, the data of user A's information backed up in client 200 may also be stored in multiple classifications.<br>
Creation of the user's self-defined user information can be accomplished via the above steps S601 andS602.<br><br>
In step S603. when a user on an\ client of the network (user A on client 200 or user B on client 300) initiates a request for viewing user A"s information in client 200. the request is sent to server 100.<br>
In step S604. server 100 analyzes the type of the request via data processing module 103 when receiving the request, determines whether the requesting client is identical with client 200. proceeds to step S605 if it is determined that the requesting client is identical with client 200, and proceeds to step S607 otherwise.<br>
In step S605, server 100 transmits to client 200 an instruction of obtaining the user information locally if it is determined that the requesting client is just client 200.<br>
In step S606, client 200 retrieves from storage module 202 the backed-up data of user A's information via analyzing and drawing module 204 after receiving the instruction fed back by server 100.<br>
In step S607, client 200 generates corresponding user A"s information card, a link of a webpage containing user A's information or etc., via analyzing and drawing module 204 according to the retrieved data of user A's information, and displays it on a user interface of client 200 which is provided for user A's viewing.<br>
In step S608, server 100 retrieves the data of user A's information from database 101 when it is determined that the requesting client is client 300, and transmits the retrieved data to client 300.<br>
In step S609, client 300, adopting analyzing and drawing module 304, analyzes the data of the user information when obtaining the data of the user information, generates corresponding user A's information card, a link of a webpage containing user A's information or etc.. and displays it one a user interface of client 300 which is provided for user B's viewing.<br>
Query of any user's self-defmed user information can be accomplished via the above steps S603 to S609.<br>
Figure 7 shows a procedure of a method for creating and querying user information in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
