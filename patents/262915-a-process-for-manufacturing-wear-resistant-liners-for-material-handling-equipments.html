FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for manufacturing wear resistant liners<br>
(alloy) for material handling equipments with improved life and better resistant to<br>
wear and impact and the alloy thereof. The material handling equipments<br>
requires a liner material that possesses a balance between the critical properties<br>
of wear resistance, good thermal stability and thorough hardening capability.<br>
Considering the above fact, a technology for manufacturing heat-treated alloyed<br>
material has been produced which shows improved wear resistance, good<br>
thermal stability and through hardening capability.<br>
The present innovation identifies the material composition and the method to<br>
produce it with an optimum combination of material characteristics that enables it<br>
to be used in a wide range of applications including liners for bunkers, hoppers,<br>
chutes, bins, railcars engaged in handling of materials like coke, sinter, iron ore.<br>
The liner material produced using the invented method offers substantially higher<br>
performances against the aggressive raw materials in terms of wear and impact<br>
These liners can successfully be used in for abrasion and erosion resistance<br>
under dry and slurry conditions in cement, mining and mineral processing<br>
industries. On investigation it has been established that the material cutting and<br>
ploughing occur due to continuous use of the liners under impact condition in<br>
handling the raw materials causing high adhesive and uneven abrasive wear of<br>
liners. Consequently, it is for this reason that most of the technology advances in<br>
materials compositions, material treatment and design are taking place.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
The liners used to protect the working surfaces of material handling equipments<br>
in steel industry are subjected to various kinds of attacks, such as wear,<br>
corrosion, impact. The choice of liner materials are governed by factors, such as<br><br>
3<br>
the application specific service requirements, ease of fabrication of a<br>
specific material in a specific form (shape, size and design). The materials used<br>
for lining application include Mn-steel, low alloy steel, martensitic stainless steel,<br>
alloy cast iron, composite plates, non-metallic materials (ceramics, UHMWP,<br>
Polyurethane, synthetic rubber, concrete). The basic problem with selection and<br>
use of liner materials lies with conflicting service requirements since the available<br>
materials and the processing techniques often offer a combination of material<br>
characteristics at the expense of each other.<br>
The presence of the high chromium in the steel alloy forms carbides, which<br>
increases wear resistance. The addition of molybdenum in the alloy increases its<br>
ability to get thorough hardened. The nickel contributes towards enhancing the<br>
impact resistance.<br>
Thermal stability refers to the ability of the material to maintain its heat-treated<br>
properties under the elevated temperatures experienced during service. A<br>
material with good thermal stability will maintain its hardness at elevated<br>
temperatures and be less susceptible to softening while in service.<br>
The liners wear by scratching of working surface because of continuous flow of<br>
raw materials resulting in loss of weight or volume. Under the impact condition,<br>
the cutting or ploughing also takes place resulting in removal of material from the<br>
working surface of liners.<br>
The resistance to wear is a direct function of the liner material, its hardness and<br>
microstructure. The ability of a liner to be through hardened is a positive attribute<br>
when considering overall performance. A thorough-hardened material has a<br>
consistent hardness throughout the cross-section and thus can be used to scrap<br>
size without re-hardening.<br>
SANKYU INC in a Japanese specification JP11207471A2 discloses wear<br>
resistant liner which improves a joining property with a steel base material at the<br><br>
4<br>
time of using a sintered hard alloy plate having an excellent wear resistance for<br>
a liner. The sintered hard alloy plate of 1-25 mm in thickness, a high chromium<br>
cast iron plate and a steel plate are laminated by diffusion joining wherein a thin<br>
sheet of copper or nickel is interposed in a boundary between the sintered hard<br>
alloy and the high chromium cast iron or copper is arranged in the sintered hard<br>
alloy side and nickel is arranged in the high chromium cast iron side. Whereby,<br>
the extreme wear resistance is displayed by the sintered hard alloy plate in the<br>
surface and the wear resistance is still maintained by the high chromium cast iron<br>
even in the case that the whole sintered hard alloy plate parts are wom or the<br>
sintered hard alloy plate is fallen down owing to a use for a long time. Therefore,<br>
a rapid damage caused by wear is prevented and the systematic maintenance<br>
working by a periodic inspection is allowed.<br>
Construction Forms. Inc. in an US specification US6467812 discloses Pipe<br>
having replaceable wear resistant lined coupler. A pipe section for concrete<br>
includes an end coupler interconnecting to another pipe section in a flow line.<br>
The coupler has an outer clamp secured extended from the pipe end with a<br>
coupling groove. An encircling clamp has sides located in the grooves of<br>
adjacent pipe sections to lock the pipe section together. The body and pipe end<br>
form an inner recess extending from the pipe end. An insert liner has a tubular<br>
portion matching the recess, with the outer surface of the tubular portion tapered<br>
to form a gap within the recess. The insert liner has an outer flange matching the<br>
outer diameter of the body and abuts the body. The inner wall of the liner has a<br>
central transition point from which the wall tapers inwardly in opposite directions<br>
to the outer end. The body member is formed of high strength ductile steel. The<br>
insert liner is formed of a wear resistant material having a Rockwell hardness of<br>
80 to 90. A carbide alloy consisting essentially of carbides , martensite, bainite<br>
and austenite, and 12-15% chromium, 2-3% carbon and traces nickel,<br>
molybdenum and austenite. A toughened ceramic is disclosed. The liner is<br>
adhesively bonded to the body using an epoxy adhesive, which is responsive to<br>
heat for release of the liner. The liner is inserted by applying adhesive on the<br>
tubular portion and then pushing the liner into the recess.<br><br>

Hotger Michael in an US specification US20040067384 discloses sliding pair<br>
used for piston-cylinder arrangements in steam motors comprises a first sliding<br>
element, preferably a piston or piston ring, made of a carbon material and a<br>
second sliding element, preferably a cylinder or guide bush. The invention relates<br>
to pairs of sliding elements for machine parts exposed to high-pressure and high-<br>
temperature steam, preferably piston-cylinder arrangements for steam engines.<br>
Here, the pairs of sliding elements consist of a first sliding element which has<br>
been produced from a synthetic, fired but not graphitized carbon material which<br>
comprises graphitized carbon black and/or natural graphite as significant filler<br>
and whose pores are filled with metal, a metal alloy, a ceramic, a synthetic resin<br>
and/or pitch which has been carbonized, preferably in the form of a piston and/or<br>
piston ring, and a second sliding element, preferably in the form of a cylinder liner<br>
or guide bush, comprising an iron-containing, high-temperature-resistant material<br>
which is preferably alloyed with chromium and/or nickel and is provided at least<br>
on the surface layer with a nitride layer, a light metal alloy, a material which has<br>
been produced by a powder-metallurgical route and comprises iron or steel and<br>
titanium carbides, a ceramic composite, a carbon material which consists of or<br>
consists essentially of graphite or a cemented hard material or a material<br>
provided with a sliding layer of cemented hard material. The pairs of sliding<br>
elements according to the invention display low wear, in particular even when<br>
exposed to supercritical steam and preferably also when exposed to liquid water.<br>
From the above discussion it becomes obvious that the liner application requires<br>
a new and improved material that possesses a balance between the critical<br>
properties of wear resistance, good thermal stability and through-hardening<br>
capability.<br><br>
6<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Considering the above fact, it is an object of the present invention to provide an<br>
improved process for manufacturing heat treated alloyed wear resistant liner<br>
material having improved wear resistance, good thermal stability and through<br>
hardening capability which contains a relatively low level of expensive alloying<br>
ingredients and also an improved heat treated alloyed liner composition thereof.<br>
The heat-treated alloyed liner composition of the present invention possesses a<br>
balance between the critical properties of wear resistance, good thermal stability<br>
and through hardening capability.<br>
Therefore, according to the present invention, there is provided a process for<br>
manufacturing heat treated alloyed wear resistant liners for material handling<br>
equipments comprising the steps such as liner material casting; guiding<br>
solidification in casting; preliminary grinding of the cast liner; testing of the<br>
surface of the cast liner material; final machining and grinding wherein the said<br>
process is characterized by heat treatment cycle of the cast high chromium iron<br>
alloy after the step of preliminary grinding followed by a final testing of surface of<br>
the shell after the final grinding process.<br>
Also, there is provided a method of preparation of heat treated alloyed wear<br>
resistant liners for material handling equipments as claimed in claim 1, wherein<br>
the said alloy consist essentially of in weight percent, about 2.0% to 2.5%<br>
carbon, 1.5% (maximum) silicon, from 0.5% to about 1.5% manganese, about<br>
0.06% maximum phosphorus, about 0.1% maximum sulphur, from 20% to about<br>
25% chromium, from 1.0% to about 1.5% each of nickel and molybdenum and<br>
balance essentially iron, moreover, an alloy having the aforesaid composition.<br><br>
7<br>
The elements carbon, silicon, sulphur, phosphorous, manganese, chromium,<br>
nickel, molybdenum and the balance there between, are critical in every sense.<br>
In the improved embodiment having superior wear resistance, good thermal<br>
stability and through hardening capability, the ranges of these elements are<br>
critical. Omission of one of the elements, or departure of any of these critical<br>
elements from the ranges set forth above results in loss in one or more of the<br>
desired properties.<br>
The liner material is expected to possess the following unique properties, which<br>
are ideal for the liners for material handling:<br>
	•	High chromium alloys are highly wear resistant<br>
	•	The tempered martensitic matrix contributes to overall strength and<br>
		toughness, as well as providing an increased hardness for resisting wear.<br>
	•	This material maintains the through hardening capability and excellent<br>
		thermal stability.<br>
Accordingly, it is a principal object of the invention to manufacture a wear<br>
resistant liner (alloy) for use in material handling equipments.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to devise a process to manufacture a<br>
wear resistant liner for use in material handling equipments.<br>
To accomplish the principle objective of the invention the constituents of the liner<br>
material are so designed so that following characteristics can be achieved which<br>
are ideal for a liner material.<br>
		a) Wear resistance.<br>
		b) Thermal stability.<br>
		c) Resistance to impact.<br><br>
8<br>
The different objectives for an ideal liner (alloy) is achieved with experiments<br>
carried out at RDCIS laboratory. The liner material produced under the current<br>
invention has successfully been used in coke weighing hoppers of blast furnace<br>
and it was found that the developed liner has 3 to 4 times superior performance<br>
compared to commonly used liner materials for such applications.<br>
It is yet another objective of the present invention to set out a process of<br>
hardening and tempering of the shell to achieve the desired results.<br>
It is yet another object of the invention to provide the alloyed liner material leads<br>
to an appreciable economy in cost of production due to extended working life of<br>
the liner.<br>
These and other objects of the present invention will become readily apparent<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The liner is a cast iron, alloyed with carbon, chromium, nickel, molybdenum,<br>
manganese, silicon, phosphorus and sulphur. The selected alloys are present<br>
within the iron at levels that provide a balance between carbide formations and<br>
generation of a tough matrix.<br>
The chemistry contains enough alloys to allow for thorough hardening of the<br>
standard thickness of the liner designs. The composition and microstructure<br>
dictate the properties of the heat-treated alloyed liner material. The<br>
microstructure of liner material consists of discontinuous network of primary<br>
carbides, and a tempered martensitic matrix.<br>
Although each of the constituents of the microstructure affects all of the<br>
properties, each affects certain properties more than others do. The tempered<br>
martensitic matrix provides the basic strength and hardness of the alloyed cast<br>
iron liner material. The wear resistance is aided by the carbide content and<br>
distribution.<br>
The preferred process technology for manufacturing heat treated alloyed liner<br>
with improved life which is suitable for use in material handling equipments,<br>
composition exhibiting superior wear resistance, good thermal stability and<br>
through hardening capability, consists essentially of, in weight percent, about 2.0<br>
to 2.5% carbon, 1.50% (max) silicon, from 0.5% to about 1.5% manganese,<br>
about 0.06% maximum phosphorus, about 0.10% maximum sulphur, from 20.0%<br>
to about 25.0% chromium, from 1.0% to about 1.5% nickel and molybdenum and<br>
balance essentially iron.<br>
In turn, this microsrtucture establishes the properties that enable the heat-treated<br>
alloyed cast iron liner material to perform well in the material handling<br>
equipments.<br><br>
10<br>
The wear resistance of the alloy material could have been improved by<br>
increasing the amount of primary carbides in the matrix. Increasing the cooling<br>
rate after casting can orient the primary carbides in a manner that can further<br>
improve the wear resistance and impact properties. A high concentration of the<br>
carbides at the boundaries would decrease the overall toughness of the material<br>
by promoting brittle fracture along the boundaries under impact loading.<br>
The chemical composition as described earlier is melted in electric furnace, and<br>
then typically static cast into a shell moulding. Shell moulding is a variation of<br>
sand moulding in which the mould is formed of a thin layer or shell of a special<br>
type of sand. The shell is formed by coating a hot metal pattern with resin<br>
impregnated sand. The heat melts the resin, which then holds the grains of sand<br>
together forming a shell. The shell is formed by coating a hot metal pattern with<br>
resin impregnated sand. The heat melts the resin, which then holds the grains of<br>
sand together forming a shell.<br>
Shelf molding is also similar to sand molding except that a mixture of sand and 3-<br>
6% resin holds the grains together. Set-up and production of shell mold patterns<br>
takes weeks, after which an output of 5-50 pieces/hr-mold is attainable.<br>
Aluminium and magnesium products average about 13.5 kg as a normal limit, but<br>
it is possible to cast items in the 45-90 kg range. Shell mold walling varies from<br>
3-10 mm thick, depending on the forming time of the resin.<br>
The different stages in shell mold processing includes:<br>
	1.	initially preparing a metal-matched plate<br>
	2.	mixing resin and sand<br>
	3.	heating pattern, usually to between 505-550 K<br>
	4.	investing the pattern (the sand is at one end of a box and the pattern at<br>
		the other, and the box is inverted for a time determined by the desired<br>
		thickness of the mill)<br>
	5.	curing shell and baking it<br>
	6.	removing investment<br><br>
11<br>
	7. inserting cores<br>
	8. repeating for other half<br>
	9. assembling mold with graphite lining<br>
	10. pouring mold (1350 - 1400ºC)<br>
	11. Guiding solidification (Optional) - The solidification pattern may be guided<br>
	using the metallic mould to produce a particular morphology of carbides which<br>
	would further be improving the properties of the liner material. The inocultation<br>
	of carbides may also be incorporated in the mould during pouring to further<br>
	enhance the wear resistance without impairing the impact resistance.<br>
	12 removing casting<br>
	13. cleaning and trimming/ frettling<br>
The mould is then taken out and preliminary grinding is carried out as per the<br>
requirement and the dimensions.<br>
The most important operation used in the process of making liners for the<br>
material handling equipments is heat treatment cycle. The treatment cycle<br>
consists of 3 steps, which is annealing, quenching and tampering. The annealing<br>
is carried over the said cast alloy liner by placing the liner in a furnace. The<br>
loading temperature of the liner and furnace is room temperature. The furnace is<br>
heated at the rate of 2 degree Celsius/min (max) to a temperature of 760 to 780<br>
degrees Celsius. The soaking time for the shell at soaking temperature is around<br>
2 hrs inside the furnace at around 760 degree Celsius. The temperature has a<br>
marked effect on microstructure and on mechanical properties such as hardness<br>
and tensile strength. Furnace cooling of the liner is being carried out to 250<br>
degree Celsius and followed by air-cooling to room temperature. Shot blasting<br>
operation is being carried out in order to clean the surface of the castings after<br>
the annealing process.<br>
Air/oil quenching is used for cooling the hardened alloy liners. The quenching<br>
process is initiated by charging the liner to 250 degree Celsius followed by<br>
heating the liner at the rate of 2 degree Celsius/min (max) to a temperature of<br>
650 degrees Celsius. The soaking time for the shell at soaking temperature is<br><br>
12<br>
around 2 hrs inside the furnace at same temperature. The liner is again<br>
heated to 850 degree Celsius at the rate of 2 degree Celsius/min and thereby<br>
soaking for around 1 hour at same temperature. The alloyed liner is again<br>
repeatedly heated to 1010 degree Celsius at the rate of 4-5 degree Celsius/min<br>
and thereby soaking for around 30 minutes at same temperature. Air or oil<br>
quenching is then carried out as per the requirement or facility provided. For oil<br>
quenching the prepared liner is dipped in the oil and for air quenching the liner is<br>
cooled in natural air so that the required properties are developed.<br>
Tempering is done immediately after quench hardening. When the steel cools to<br>
about 40 ºC after quenching, it is ready to be tempered. After quenching,<br>
castings are usually tempered at temperatures well below the transformation<br>
range for about 1h per inch of thickest section. As the quenched iron is<br>
tempered, its hardness decreases, whereas it usually gains in strength and<br>
toughness. Herein the hardened liners are is tempered by heating the liners from<br>
room temperature to a temperature of 470 degree Celsius (460-480 degree<br>
Celsius) at a rate of 2 degree Celsius/min (max). Here also the soaking time for<br>
the hardened liners at soaking temperature is a round 3 hrs. The cooling of the<br>
liners is done outside the furnace in natural air to room temperature. The pre-<br>
tempered liner is again reheated from room temperature to a temperature of 400<br>
degree Celsius (400-420 degree Celsius) at a rate of 2 degree Celsius/min<br>
(max). Here also the soaking time for the hardened shell at soaking temperature<br>
is around 3 hrs. The cooling of the shell is done outside the furnace by forced air<br>
to room temperature.<br>
The liners are hardened and tempered to improve their mechanical properties,<br>
particularly strength and wear resistance. After being quenched and tempered,<br>
the hardness is made to an average of 53-55 HRC. The hardened irons usually<br>
exhibit wear resistance approximately five times greater than that of Mn-steel<br>
liners. The hardness of the liner measure after cast is 44-45 HRC and 56-58<br>
HRC after quenching. Further, the micro-hardness achieved for the primary<br>
carbide is 965 to 1120 HV and 500 to 600 HV for the final matrix.<br><br>
13<br>
The liners are then subjected to a machining and grinding process, which<br>
removes the effects hardening and tampering, and ensures a flat surface. The<br>
purpose of grinding is to lessen the depth of deformed metal to a point. Belt, disk,<br>
and surface grinders, cylindrical grinders can be used which further uses<br>
abrasives bonded to a surface and the final dimensions are achieved as per the<br>
drawings.<br>
After machining and grinding the shell is subjected to ultrasonic testing for a<br>
second time. Ultrasonic testing (UT) is one of the most widely used techniques<br>
for discontinuity detection and material characterization in various engineering<br>
fields. The advantages of UT as compared to other nondestructive techniques for<br>
metal tests are higher penetration, higher sensitivity and greater accuracy.<br>
The iron based materials exhibit good thermal properties. The wear resistance is<br>
good due to the presence of the primary carbides. The low as-cast hardness of<br>
the high chromium iron alloy can limit the wear resistance of the material.<br>
Chemical composition is an important parameter influencing the heat treatment<br>
of high chromium irons. Manganese, nickel, and molybdenum are the recognized<br>
elements for increasing the hardenability of high chromium iron. Although<br>
chromium, by itself, does not influence the hardenability of high chromium irons,<br>
its contribution to carbide stabilization is important.<br>
The above-described embodiments of the invention are intended to be examples<br>
of the present invention. Numerous modifications, changes and improvements<br>
within the scope of the invention will occur to the reader. Those of skill in the art<br>
