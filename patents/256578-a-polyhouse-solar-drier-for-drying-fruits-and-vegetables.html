				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a polyhouse solar drier for sun drying of fruits and vegetables particularly in cold regions.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
In the high attitude regions, cold and climatic conditions prevail where nothing grows during the winter (Oct-Apr) and the growing seasons is restricted only to summer months i.e. May to Oct. Also the area remains cut-off during the winter months from rest of the nation. This poses serious problem for supply of fresh food items like fresh vegetables, fruits, milk, meat, etc. Thus, storage and processing of these items for winter months is the only solution to the problem.<br>
Sun drying of perishable crops is perhaps the oldest and easiest method of food preservation. In Ladakh apricot, apple, tomato, onion, leafy vegetables etc. are sun popularly during glut season (summer) by the local farmer. The traditional method of drying comprises putting the material in sum in an open places like rooftop, stone etc. which takes longer time up the product.<br><br>
One of the disadvantages of this method of drying is that the material get contaminated with dirt and files. Another disadvantage is loss of colour and excessive drying. Sudden bad weather sometimes also affect the quality of the dried product. Moreover, Ladakh receives approx. 300-310 sunny days per year which is maximum in the country. The region also receives very high light intensity for longer period Ladakh cold and region of the country has the advantages of having maximum number of sunny days (300-310 sunny days) in a year which is maximum number in the country. Strong solar radiation and clear weather during harvesting season i.e. during July-September offers unique opportunity to harness the solar energy for drying of fruits and vegetables in the region. As such, there is a requirement of a suitable solar-based-dried for drying of fruits and vegetables.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of the invention is to provide a polyhouse solar drier which is capable of hygienic drying of fruits and vegetables in a scientific manner.<br>
Another object of the invention is to. provide a polyhouse solar drier which does not require any artificial heating devices for drying purposes.<br>
Still another of the invention is to provide a polyhouse solar drier which can be fabricated very easily. Yet a further object of the invention is to provide a polyhouse solar drier which is highly efficient.<br>
A still further object of the invention is to provide a polyhouse solar drier which can provide a temperature of 60-65°C and dry the fruits and vegetable in 18-32 sunny hours.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide a polyhouse solar drier which is capable of drying fruits and vegetables surplus on commercial scale (100-200Kg).<br>
A still further object of the invention is to provide a polyhouse solar drier which is cost effective and which can easily be adopted by local farmers.<br>
SUMMERY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided a polyhouse solar drier for drying fruits and vegetables comprising:<br>
- a green house structure of tubular pipes (5) and covered with a U-V stablished polythene sheet (3) for trapping the solar radiation, the said green house structure having a passage in center and having plurality of rows provided ion both sides of the passage inside the said structure, the said plurality of rows further comprising plurality of removable trays for storing purposes;<br><br>
-	a door (4) provided at one and of the said green house structure provided an opening to the said passage inside the said structure;<br>
-	a ventilator (6) with an exhaust fan provided at the opposite top end of the said green house structure.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a polyhouse solar dryer of the dryer which is capable of drying fruit and vegetables in scientific and hygienic manner in cold and arid region particularly in Ladakh. The polyhouse solar dryer of the present invention is capable of providing a temperature of 60-65°C and drying the fruits and vegetable 18-32 sunny hours. The polyhouse solar dryer of the present invention is cost effective, simple in design and can easily be adopted by local farmers.<br>
The polyhouse solar dryer of the present invention is basically a greenhouse structure having a dimension of for example 6.0 ft (height x 15 ft (length) x 7.0 ft (width). The volume of structure is based on the quantity of fruits or vegetables to be dried at a time. The green house structure is constructed upon frames made GI pipes. Inside the structure, there are plurality of trays arranged in rows and tiers for putting the fruits and vegetables to be dried. The number and size of the trays depends upon the inside space of the structure. The access to the structure is through a door (approx, size 6.0 X 1.5 ft) having fly proof mesh and polythene cover. It has also a ventilator on the top, opposite to door for air circulation and removal of moist air. The structure is covered with U-V stabilized polythene sheet which traps the solar radiations in the day time and enhance the inside temperature which maintain the internal temperature of the structure to a optimum level required for drying of fruits and vegetables for drying. Cross ventilation helps in air circulation and removal of moisture emitted from fruits and vegetables during the process of drying providing ideal conditions for drying under dust free hygienic conditions. It also reduces the browning of the products and protects them from rains, flies etc. Further, the solar drier of the present invention does not require any kind of external energy/ power.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF FIGURE<br>
Any further characteristics, advantages and application of the invention will become evident from the detailed description of the preferred embodiment which has been described and illustrated with the help of following drawing wherein,<br>
Fig 1:	provides the isometric view of the solar dryer.<br><br>
DESCRIPTION WITH RESPECT TO DRAWING<br>
Referring to Fig. 1 the polyhouse solar dryer of the present invention is basically a rectangular greenhouse structure having appropriate dimension suiting the requirement. The size of this structure is about 15 ft (length), 7.0 ft (width) and 6.0 ft (height). The greenhouse structure is constructed upon frames (5) made of GI pipes. The volume of structure is based on the quantity of fruits or vegetables to be dried at a time. The access to the structure is through a door (1) having fly proof mesh and polythene cover. The door is about 6.0 ft high X 3.0 ft wide and is provided on front wall. The structure is covered with U-V stabilized polythene sheet (3) which, traps the solar radiations in the day time and enhance the inside temperature which maintain the internal temperature of the structure to a optimum level required for drying of fruits and vegetables for drying whole of the day. Inside the structure, there are plurality of removable trays in 4 tiers on both side of the path at a distance of about 1.5 ft in between except the lowest tray which is at about 2.0 ft from the ground level. These trays are of size of about 3.0 X 2.0 ft fitted along length of the structure on both sidewalls leaving 3.0 ft spave in between for movement. These trays are meant for putting the material to be dried. The number and size of the trays depend upon the inside space of the structure. A ventilator (6) (about 1-1.5 ft length and width) is provided with mosquito proofing mesh just on top of opposite to the door with an exhaust fan, working with solarenergy panels for air circulation and removal of moist air. Inlet (2) is also provided in the front<br><br>
side of the structure. Cross ventilation helps in air circulation and removal of moisture emitted from fruits and vegetables during the process of drying. This provides ideal conditions for drying of fruits and vegetables under dust free hygienic conditions. It also reduces the browing of the products and protects them from rains, flies etc. moreover, it does not require any kind of external power/ energy.<br>
The present embodiment of the invention, which has been set forth above, was fir the purpose of illustration and is not intended to limit the scope of the invention. It is to be understood that various changes, adaptions and modifications can be made in the invention described above by those skilled in the art with out departing from the scope of the invention, which has been defined by following claims:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
I CLAIM:<br>
