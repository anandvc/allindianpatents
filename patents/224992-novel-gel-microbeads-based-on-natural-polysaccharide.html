				<td>PRIOR ART AND DEFECTS<br>
In the past decades, microparticles/microbeads have received a growing scientific<br>
and industrial interest because of the several advantages offered by them over the single -<br>
unit dosage forms. In Pharmaceuticals, multiunit dosage forms have been mainly used as<br>
drug delivery systems, as they offer advantages like controlled and targeted drug delivery<br>
of drugs, predictable and uniform drug release avoiding the vagaries of gastric emptying<br>
and different transit rates through the gastrointestinal tract, and avoidance of local<br>
irritation. And many other specific applications of microparticles/microbeads are given in<br>
the literatures.<br>
In the above context, oil-in-oil-emulsion-soivent (O/O) evaporation technique was<br>
developed to prepare microparticles/microbeads. Previously, we have prepared<br>
microparticles by emulsifying colloidal dispersion of ethylcellulose/acetone (Sa. B., et<br>
al., Drug Development and Industrial Pharmacy, Vol.16 (1990)1153), eudragit/ acetone<br>
(PurkaitK., et al., S.T.P.Pharma Sciences, Vol.4 (1994) 264), and cellulose acetate<br>
butyrate/acetone by other workers (Torres. D.,et al., International Journal of<br>
Pharmaceutics,Vol.173(1998)171) in liquid paraffin followed by rigidization of the<br>
formed microparticles using large volume of organic solvents like petroleum ether, n-<br>
hexane etc. Use of large volume of organic solvents have been criticized by several<br>
Governmental agencies and environmentalists as large scale use of these solvents may<br>
give rise to toxicity to the working personnel, environmental pollution and are<br>
uneconomical. These literatures did not discuss on the disadvantages associated with the<br>
use of large amount of organic solvents.<br>
In order to overcome the problems associated with oil in oil-emulsion-solvent<br>
evaporation technique, oil-in-water-emulsion-solvent evaporation (O/W) technique was<br>
developed. In examples based on oil-in-water-emulsion solvent evaporation techniques,<br>
microparticles were prepared by emulsifying colloidal dispersion of polymethyl<br>
methacrylate/dichloromethane (Sa. B., et al., Pharmaceutical Sciences.Vol.2 (1996) 209),<br>
polystyrene/dichloromethane (Sa. B.,et al., Bolletino Chimico Farmaceutico,Vol .138<br>
(1999)47l)cellulose butyrate/acetone in gelatin solution(Torres. D.,et al., International<br>
Journal of Pharmaceutics, Vol.173(1998)171) in water containing suitable hydrocolloids<br>
like gelatin, methylcellulose.<br>
Although, in O/W emulsion-solvent evaporation technique, large amount of<br>
organic solvent was replaced by aqueous phase, use of organic solvent in the internal<br>
phase could not be eliminated. The absence of trace amount of organic solvent in the final<br>
product is yet questionable.<br>
An alternative and promising research deals with microparticfes/microbeads<br>
obtained from hydrophilic polymers. Most of the hydrophilic polymers are available as<br>
natural polymers at affordable price. Among the natural polymers, polyanionic polymers<br>
such as sodium alginate, sodium pectinate and carrageenan have been exploited for<br>
preparing microparitcles/mierobeads by ionotropic in-situ gelation technique which can<br>
be carried out under mild process conditions.<br>
The references related to the use of sodium alginate for preparing microparticles/<br>
microbeads include the following:<br>
Kierstan.M., et.al,, Biotechnology and Bioengineering. Vol..26(1982)1507,<br>
describes the use of sodium alginate gels for immobilization, solid separation and<br>
diffusion chromatography techniques; US patent 6,432,449 discloses the use of alginate<br>
for sustained release of proteins; Tomida.H.,et al., Chemical and Pharmaceutical<br>
Bulletin.Vol.41(1993)1475; El-Kamel., et al, Journal of Microencapsulation. Vol. 20<br>
(2003)21.<br>
Use of pectin has been cited in the following examples:<br>
Pillay.V., et al., Journal of Controlled Release.Vol.59( 1999) 229; Aydun.Z., et<br>
al., International Journal of Pharmaceutics. Vol. 137( 1996) 133; Sriamornsak.P. European<br>
Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences. Vol.8, 1999,221.<br>
Another polyanionic natural polymer tried in this area is k-carrageenan:<br>
Garcia A.M., et al, Journal of controlled Release, 40(1996) 179; An-Lac Nguyen.,<br>
et al., Biotechnology and Bioengineering. Vol.28, 1986,1261.<br>
These reports teach us that, using in-situ gelation technique, polyanions can be<br>
easily tailored to formulate into carriers for active agents and other materials. It is also<br>
well known that unless specially treated, none of these gel beads remain intact and<br>
maintain its integrity throughout the dissolution studies in intestinal fluids. Hence it<br>
would have been appreciated if any of the gel beads prepared by these polyanionic<br>
polymers had maintained gel-integrity even after dissolution studies. Thus, there is still a<br>
need to develop gel-bead system that influences the release of incorporated active agents<br>
by maintaining the gel-integrity till all the core material is released from the beads.<br>
Subsequent studies in prior art were related to improve the strength of gel beads, and<br>
comprise the following examples.<br>
Poly-L-lysine, a polycation was used to modulate the permeability and strength of<br>
alginate beads in the following references:<br>

of alginate beads.<br>

The prior art mentioned above contains reports mainly based on alginate gel<br>
matrix to prepare microparticles/microbeads and modifications of gel strength through<br>
the use of other poloycations (poly-L-lysine,chitosan,etc.,). It would have been a novel<br>
and economical approach, if any natural polysaccharide other than sodium alginate, was<br>
exploited for preparing gel-microbead system. In this view, the present invention seeks<br>
to provide a novel gel-microbead system based on natural polysaccharide, which<br>
promises to retain its structural integrity even after the dissolution studies.<br>
The objectives of this invention are as follows:<br>
1. The main objective of this invention is to provide a gel-microbeads system<br>
based on natural polysaccharide and produced under simple and mild process conditions.<br>
2. Another objective of the invention is to establish the gel-microbeads suitable as<br>
carrier for therapeutic agents and as drug delivery system.<br>
3. Yet another objective of the invention is to prove that gel-microbeads maintain<br>
their gel-integrity at different pH values encountered in gastro-intestinal tract.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention presents a new gel-microbeads as a carrier for bioactive<br>
agents and other materials used in pharmaceutical and biomedical applications. The gel-<br>
microbeads of the invention are produced by an interaction between a new polyanion,<br>
sodium carboxyalkyl polysaccharide and metallic cation(s), using ionotropic in-situ<br>
gelation technique. This invention also presents a procedure for chemical modification of<br>
polysaccharide from native polysaccharide.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention includes the optimization of concentration<br>
of polymer and gelation medium to improve the shape and strength of the gel-<br>
microbeads.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, gel microbeads have been presented<br>
as carrier for the model drugs theophylline anhydrous and furosemide, and in vitro<br>
release studies were carried out to assess release profiles and stability /integrity of the<br>
gel-microbeads after dissolution studies.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Gel-microbead system based on the chemically modified bacterial polysaccharide<br>
is provided. The gel-microbeads according to the invention are compulsorily made from<br>
alkali metal salt of carboxy alkyl polysaccharide. Chemical modification of bacterial<br>
polysaccharide is known from the prior art and do not form main part of this invention.<br>
The chemical modification of bacterial polysaccharide, xanthomonas campestris, include<br>
substitution of alkali metal carboxy alkyl groups through ether linkage to at least one of<br>
the hydroxyl groups on the back bone of the polysaccharide. Composition of the gel<br>
microbeads and process for the production of these gel-microbeads comprise the main<br>
part of this invention.<br>
The process for the production of gel-microbeads can be any of the methods<br>
known as interionic/polyelectrolyte interaction, chemical gelation, ionic-cross linking or<br>
ionotropic in-situ gelation technique but is preferably the latter.<br>
The present invention provides a process for gel-microbead production<br>
comprising the following steps,<br>
a) Preparation of aqueous solutions (sol) of chemically modified polysaccharide,<br>
b) Dropping the sol (step a) to metal salt solution known as as gelation medium,<br>
c) Curing of gel beads (step b) for different periods in metal salt solution to<br>
provide gelation or crosslinking of polysaccharide,<br>
d) Harvesting the gel-microbeads (step c) from the gelation medium and<br>
e) Drying of gel-microbeads (step d).<br>
Methods for preparing sol (step a) are well known in the art and do not comprise<br>
the part of this invention.<br>
The metal salt solutions (step b) used can be known as gelation medium, curing<br>
agent or crosslinking agent. The gelation medium used in the invention comprises both<br>
divalent and trivalent type of metal cations. Metal cations used include but are not limited<br>
to Ca2+, Ba2+, Mg2+, Sn2+, Al3+ and Fe3+. The transition of sol to a firm gel state was<br>
dependent on the type of cation.<br>
Addition of sol (step b) for the production of gel-microbeads can make use of<br>
hypodermic syringe with needle, peristaltic pump, spraying apparatus which can atomize<br>
the sol in to an appropriate mean particle size or any container with or without spout on it<br>
to let the droplets onto the gelation bath. The droplets, as soon as they come in contact<br>
with the gelation medium, should completely enter into the gelation medium for more<br>
effective cross-linking. Gel formation (step c) is an instantaneous process at the interlace<br>
of sol and gelation medium; however, complete gelation occurs over a period of 24 h.<br>
Gel beads can be harvested (step d) from gelation bath by conventional technique.<br>
i.e., filtration. Gel beads can be dried in hot-air oven, vacuum oven or rotary dryer at<br>
60°C, or overnight in open air at room temperature.<br>
Mean size of the gel-microbeads depends on bore size of the hypodermic needle<br>
or droplet of sol entering the gelation medium. As an example, needle with bore number<br>
16 produced gel-microbeads with mean size range 941.55(±35.71) micrometer.<br>
Reproducibility of the shape and size depends upon, the flow rate of sol droplets<br>
from the needle, distance of the needle from gelation bath surface and direction<br>
(vertical/horizontal) of the needle.<br>
Although sol-gel transition is independent of concentration of sol and gelation<br>
medium, formation of gel-microbeads of appropriate size and shape are dependent on the<br>
solution viscosity, which is dependent on the concentration of sol, that in turn affects the<br>
mobility of sol, and hence shape and size of the droplets of sol entering the gelation<br>
medium.<br>
Gel-microbeads produced in this invention are free-flowing provided the beads<br>
are symmetric in shape.<br>
Other factors considered in gel-microbead production include, variations in length<br>
of curing time and strength of gelation medium.<br>
To produce isolable gels beads, gelation step (step c) proceeds at least 5-30 min,<br>
while for almost completely gelled beads, prefers 24 h and more optimally 2-4 h. The<br>
strength of gelling medium was varied between 0.25-5%w/v, preferably 1-2%<br>
concentration was found to be effective enough in producing perfect gel-microbeads.<br>
Gel-microbeads can be stored in moisture-free sealed container or vacuum<br>
desiccator at room temperature.<br>
Both polymer solution and gelation medium are formed using water as solvent<br>
and water is the only solvent used throughout the invention, which makes the device safe<br>
and economic.<br>
Gel-microbeads: as carrier gystem:-<br>
Many other microbeads/microparticles have been used in the art as carriers for<br>
bioactive agents or other materials. Gel-microbeads produced from chemically modified<br>
polysaccharide polymer provided herein can also be used as carrier for bioactive<br>
agents(s), or any other agent which is compatible, on-gelling or non-dehydrating. Such<br>
agent(s) include drug, enzyme, protein, plant or animal cells, fine particles, powder<br>
and/or water miscible agent.<br>
In other preferred embodiment of this invention, the process further comprises<br>
incorporating drugs such as, theophylline anhydrous, furosemide. indomethacin,<br>
diltiazem hydrochloride, propranolol hydrochloride, ibuprofen, and mtrofutsntoln.<br>
The invention can be appreciated from the following examples, which are<br>
intended as further illustration of the invention, but not as a limitation on the scope of the<br>
invention, hi addition, with respect to the above description or examples below, one<br>
skilled in the art will be able to make the necessary changes to the disclosure for a large<br>
scale production of gel-microbeads.<br>
EXAMPLE 1: This example describes the preparation of chemically modified<br>
polysaccharide (i.e. sodium salt of carboxymethyl xanthan gum).<br>
Preparation and standardization of alkali metal carboxy alkyl polysaccharide (i.e.<br>
sodium salt of carboxymethyl xanthan gum) was carried out with a batch size of 10 G of<br>
xanthomonas campestris polysaccharide/xanthan gum. Initially, polysaccharide was<br>
slowly dispersed in ice-cold alkali metal hydroxide solution (45%w/v) for lh. Alkali<br>
metal hydroxide preferred is sodium hydroxide. A solution (75%w/v) of hallo fatty acid,<br>
preferably with smallest chain length (chloroacetic acid), was added under constant<br>
blending and mixing. The temperature of the reaction mixture was raised slowly and held<br>
at 75°C for lh. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, subdivided on a<br>
flat surface and dried in a vacuum oven at 50°C. The product was ground to a 65 mesh<br>
size(British Standard Sieve) and washed in 80% methanol to get products with different<br>
degree of metal ion substitution ranging from 2.2 - 2.8 ppm (analyzed by atomic<br>
absorption spectrophotometer, Perkin-Elmer, Model No.2380).<br>
EXAMPLES 2: Formation of gel beads.<br>
A solution (1-3%) of chemically modified polysaccharide was prepared in<br>
deionized water. Bubble free solution was loaded in a hypodermic syringe (with a needle<br>
of bore size. 16) and dripped into 100ml of gelation medium (0.25-5%). The gel beads<br>
were harvested from the gelation medium after 24 h, and washed with deionized water<br>
(3x100ml) for 30 min. After blotting excess surface water with a tissue paper, gel beads<br>
were spread on petri-dish and dried in open-air for 12 h followed by drying in vacuum-<br>
oven at 60°C for 4 h.<br>
EXAMPLE 3: Formulation of drug loaded gel-microbeads and in vitro dissolution<br>
studies:<br>
(A) Theophylline loaded gel-microbeads.<br>
Theophylline (30%w/\v)- loaded gel-microbeads were prepared by dispersing<br>
known amount of theophylline in 2.0%w/v modified polysaccharide and dropping the<br>
solution to a gelation medium (l%w/v, 100ml) containing same concentration of<br>
theophylline. Gel beads were cured for 4 h, filtered, and dried for 12h in open-air<br>
followed by dxying in vacuum-oven at 60°C for 4 h.<br>
Release of theophylline from gel-microbeads was assessed using dissolution rate<br>
test equipment USP XXI (Campbell Electronics, Bombay, India) in 500ml (37±0.5°C,<br>
l00rpm) of both hydrochloric acid buffer solution (pH 1.2, 0AM) and phosphate buffer<br>
(pH 6.8).<br>
(3) Furosemide loaded gel-microbeads.<br>
Furoseraide loaded (30%w/w) gel-microbeads were prepared by dispersing<br>
weighed amount of furosemide in 2%w/v modified polysaccharide solution and dropping<br>
the solution into a gelation medium(l%w/v, 100ml). Gel beads were cured for 4 h,<br>
filtered, and dried for 12h in open-air followed by drying in vacuum-oven at 60°C for 4 h.<br>
Release of furosemide from gel-microbeads was assessed using dissolution rate<br>
test equipment USP XXI (Campbell Electronics, Bombay, India) in 500ml (37±0.5°C, 50<br>
rpm) phosphate buffer (pH 6.8).<br>
The following figures are used to substantiate the accompanying drawings of the<br>
invention.<br>
FIGURE 1. FTIR spectra shows chemical modification of native polysaccharide.<br>
FIGURE 2. Scanning electron micrographs of gel-microbeads depict the effect of<br>
variables such as polymer concentration and gelation medium concentration<br>
on the morphology of beads.<br>
FIGURE 3. shows in vitro release profiles of the model drugs theophylline (A) in buffer-<br>
pH 1.2 (•), pH 6.8 (o); and furosemide (B) in buffer pH 6.8.<br>
FIGURE 4. Scanning electron micrographs of gel-microbeads indicating the gel-integrity<br>
of the gel-microbeads before (A) and after (B) dissolution studies.<br>
Figure 1 shows that, after chemical modification of the native polysaccharide, the<br>
bands of carboxylate anion at 1613 cm"1 (asymmetrical) and 1406cm-1 (symmetrical) of<br>
native polysaccharide (Figure 1A), were shifted and sharpened at 1608 cm-1 and 141 lcm-<br>
1 as seen in modified polysaccharide (Figure 1B), and a sharp peak appeared at 1328cm-1<br>
(Figure 1B) confirms C-0 stretching bond. Loss of band at 1726 cm"1 from native<br>
polysaccharide (in Figure 1 A) was due to the hydrolysis of O-6-acetyl group by sodium<br>
hydroxide addition.<br>
Figure 2 shows the effect of process variables (such as gelation medium<br>
concentration and polymer concentration) on the morphology of dried gel-microbeads. It<br>
is clear from the figure 2 that, beads developed wavy surface at lowest gelation medium<br>
concentration (0.25%)(Figure 2A) and any gelation medium above 1% concentration had<br>
no influence on the surface structure of gel-microbeads(Figure 2B).Gel-microbeads were<br>
spherical in shape at 2% polymer concentration (Figure 2C) and at polymer concentration<br>
above 3% beads were elongated (Figure 2D).<br>
Figure 3 shows that, theophylline (Figure 3A) was released from the gel-<br>
microbeads over a period of 3 h while furosemide (Figure 3B) was released over an<br>
extended period of 5 h.<br>
Figures 4A and 4B respectively show the gel-microbead structures before and<br>
after dissolution study in pH 6.8, and demonstrate the stability of the gel-microbeads in<br>
terms of gel-integrity.<br>
