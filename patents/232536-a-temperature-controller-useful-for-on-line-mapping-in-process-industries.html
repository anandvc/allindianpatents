				<td>The present invention relates to a temperature controller useful for on-line mapping  in<br>
process industries.<br>
The temperature controller for on-line mapping finds application in processing industries like chemical, petroleum, paper, food and agriculture. It is particularly useful for foods like fruit and vegetable processing, sterilization of packed meat products, sterilization of fabricated foods, evaluation of thermal process schedules of foods, determination of thermal process schedules of foods. It can also be used to operate multiple sterilization systems and map the temperature in any heating system.<br>
Reference may be made to US patent No. 4682605, Hoffman (1987), Liquid Crystal<br>
matrix for extended range high resolution temperature mapping, wherein a recurrent<br>
matrix pattern of temperature sensitive cluster of liquid crystal dots are employed to map<br>
^emperature gradient. Each crystal dot changes color at a different temperature. The<br>
drawback of this work is that it is applicable only when a perceptible color change occurs<br>
in the target media. It has to be physically affixed onto the target on a plane surface. It is<br>
mainly applicable for medical applications and not suitable for processing industries. It is<br>
not suitable for wet steam applications. Also, the invention relates to mapping of<br>
temperature without any feedback control.<br>
Reference may be made to US patent No. 4,820,917, loannou (1989) "Stress and<br>
temperature mapping using an array of optical fibers and charge coupled devices"<br>
wherein, an array of optical fibers are used and temperature is detected by the dark<br>
current in the pixels of the charge coupled device mounted along the length of the fiber,<br>
which is a function of   temperature. The drawback of this system is that it is based on<br>
microbending of light developed due to stress and cannot be used in processing<br>
industries. The temperature measurement range is limited to 100 C. Also, the invention<br>
relates to mapping of temperature without any feedback control.<br>
Reference may be made to US Patent No. 5,293.877 (Ogata. G.J., Korff, J.J. and Grill, P.A., 1992) "Body temperature thermometer and method for measuring human body temperature utilizing calibration mapping" wherein, the system comprises of an infrared sensor whose signals are processed using a processor to get the plurality of the temperatures. The drawback of this work is that, it is specific for applications wherein there is a generation of infrared signals as in human ear canal. Also, the invention relates to mapping of temperature without any feedback control.<br>
Reference may be made to US Patent No. 5,160,842 (Johnson, D.A. 1992) "Infrared fire-perimeter mapping" wherein, the system comprises of a thermal data- acquisition system mountable on a support platform for moving over a ground fire and including thermal-image-data streams. The drawback of this work is that, it is of non-contact type and gathers thermal data from a broad area rather from a specific target point thereby making it unsuitable for process applications. Also, the invention relates to mapping of temperature without any feedback control.<br>
Reference may be made to US  Patent No.  5,542,915, Edwards  S.T., Lax, R.G.,<br>

ultrasound probe" wherein the apparatus consists of a catheter with RF emitting stylet to<br>
monitor the temperature of the tissue being ablated by using an ultrasound probe. The<br>
drawback of this work is that it is specific to applications wherein ultrasound signals can<br>
be induced with the active catheter. Also, the invention relates to mapping of temperature<br>
without any feedback control.<br>
Reference may be made to USjiatent No. 5,818,057, Buck (1998) "Simultaneous luminescence pressure and temperature mapping" wherein, luminescence dye (Perylene) based temperature and pressure mapping system has been developed. Absorbed luminescence has a approximately linear relationship with temperature which has been used for temperature mapping. The drawback of this work is that it is applicable only if an excitation source and an imaging system is employed. Also, the luminescent dye has to be applied on to the material by polishing the si-rface before and after applying the dye<br>
hence making it applicable for surface temperature only . Also , the invention relates to mapping of temperature without any feedback.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a temperature controller useful for on-line mapping in process industries which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above. Another object of the present invention is to provide a system for mapping and controlling of high temperatures.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a system for conversion of manual processing system to a semi-automatic processing system.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a system for mapping and controlling of high temperatures with reduced response time.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a system for processing the mapped temperatures to obtain useful indices indicating the efficacy of the process. Still another object of the present invention is to provide a system for mapping and control of process temperatures in any media like steam, hot water, hot air and steam-air mixtures. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a system for mapping temperatures in multiple processing equipment.<br>

In an embodiment to the present invention which is referred to as MODE 2, the system for online temperature mapping and control as applicable to sterilization of packaged foods for preservation is as shown in Figure 2 of the drawings. This facilitates semiautomatic control of the sterilization process. This comprises of the system (15) of the present invention. A set of temperature sensors (16) are placed inside the test containers (17) integrated with the control system for obtaining temperature signals of the sterilizer/retort/process reactors (18) and from the test containers, out of which the slowest heating sensor is identified during thermal processing. The system is designed to incorporate control of steam valves (19), vent valve (20), cold water (21) and drain valve (22) using solenoid valves. The inputs for this embodiment are set sterilization (Fo) value and sterilizer/retort/process reactors temperature and the percentage of Fo value to be attained during the heating phase. The remaining part of the Fo value is realized during the cooling phase. The system accumulates sterilization (Fo) value every 30 seconds till the specified percentage of set value is reached and the system displays the controlled<br>
sterilizer/retort/process reactors temperature, (Fo) value, and process time on a real time basis. Once the set percentage of Fo value is attained, the cooling phase is automatically initiated.<br>

containers integrated with the control system for obtaining temperature signals of the<br>
sterilizer/retort/process reactors and from the test containers, out of which the slowest<br>
heating sensor is identified during thermal processing. The inputs for this embodiment are<br>
sterilizer/retort/process   reactors   temperature   and   the   process   time.   The   system<br>
accumulates sterilization (Fo) value every 30 seconds till the specified process time is<br>
. reached and displays the controlled sterilizer/retort/process reactors temperature, (Fo)<br>
value,   and  process time on a real time basis. This facilitates heat penetration studies<br>
which enables to prescribe process schedules for different foods.<br>
In yet another embodiment which is referred to as MODE 1, the   system for online<br>
temperature  mapping  and  control  as   applicable  to  sterilizer/sterilizer/retort/process<br>
reactors/process reactors, which comprises of the developed system, a set of temperature<br>
sensors, inside the   sterilizer/sterilizer/retort/process reactors/process reactors   with the<br>
control system for obtaining temperature signals of the sterilizer/sterilizer/retort/process<br>
reactors/process reactors, out of which the slowest heating sensor is identified during<br>
thermal processing. The inputs for this embodiment are sterilizer/retort/process reactors<br>

process time on a real time basis every 30 seconds till the specified process time is<br>
reached.   This   facilitates  temperature  mapping  and  control  of the  sterilizer/retort<br>
indicating the heat profile in the reactor.<br>
In yet another embodiment, all the previous embodiments can be applied for mapping and control of multiple sterilizers/retorts/reactors.<br>
The novelty of the present system is that it is a temperature mapping system with control applicable for process industries to generate useful data regarding the efficacy of the process and possible energy savings due to reduction in the prescribed process times. example, when applied to a sterilizer/process retort systems the sterilization (Fo) value is displayed and the entire process is monitored and controlled to achieve the required Fo value generating useful databank of process schedules for different foods. As the sterilization value is displayed on-line, this system car also account for sudden fluctuations in sterilizer/retort/process reactors temperature and still ensure the completion of the process taking into account the thermal history of the process. The control system extends the process automatically incase of power failures or sudden drop in temperature due to unavoidable situations, during processing.<br>
The invention when applied to food processing industries,   can be operated in three different modes  to  map  the thermal profile inside the sterilizer and  control  the sterilization process based on the sterilization (Fo) value with real time display of Fo . value derived from the mapped and controlled temperature and process time! When using in MODE 2, Fo value and sterilizer temperature are set. The process begins by opening Vent and Steam valves. These are indicated by the respective indicators. The control system will first check the vent temperature. Once the vent temperature reaches prescribed temperature, the process time module starts the up counter. The sterilizer temperature is read every second as accurate control of the same is  required. Once the sterilizer reactors temperature reaches the set value the indicator for cooking will be ON.<br>
t<br>
The coldest temperature out of the    test containers is identified and Fo for this temperature starts accumulating. Once every 30 seconds the system displays the sterilizer temperature,  Fo  and  elapsed  time.   On/Off control  is provided  for steam.   If the temperature goes below the set point the steam valve will be opened otherwise it will be closed. After the  set Fo is achieved, the steam valve is closed and cold water valve is opened and the system checks for sterilizer temperature to be less than 40 C. Once this temperature is reached the cold water valve is closed and drain will be opened. This ends the process which is indicated by audible and visual alarms.As the targeted sterilization value is set on the system for control, no safety factor is required as provided in the conventional systems. The system also accounts for cooling time lethality and these features reduces the overall processing time. This facilitates increase in nutrient retention and hence a better quality product. In the conventional system the cooling time lethality is considered to be a safety margin to reduce rejection of under processed products.<br>
The system can be employed in MODE 3 for determining the process schedules of foods, in terms of Fo value. The system generates heat penetration data for entire duration of the process based on the mapped temperature together with the control of the sterilizer . temperature.<br>
The examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>

i<br>
washed in running tap water and blanched at 97( C for 3 minutes using hot water in steam<br>
jacketed kettles. Soon after blanching, the material was cooled using tap water to arrest<br>
further cooking. The open top sanitary cans coated with differential tin coating having a<br>
net weight of 850 g were used in the experiments. The material was filled into washed<br>
and sterilized cans and a brine solution (2%) was added. The filled cans were exhausted<br>
using steam exhaust box and then sealed. Thermocouples were fixed into 6 test cans and<br>

otherwise it will be closed. After the set Fo is achieved, the steam valve is closed and cold<br>
water valve is opened and now the system checks whether the sterilizer/retort/process<br>
reactors temperature is less than 40° C. Once this temperature is reached the cold water valve<br>
is closed and drain will be opened. This ends the process which is indicated by audible and<br>
visual alarms. After the sterilizer/retort/process reactors is completely^ -.^cd the cans are<br>
taken out. Thermocouples are removed.<br>
When using the conventional method, Mode 3 was selected during which the process time was set to 35 minutes and sterilizer/retort/process reactors temperature was set to 116° C. The process begins by opening Vent and Steam valves. These are indicated by the respective indicators. The control system will first check the vent temperature. Once the vent temperature reaches 95° C, the process time module starts the up counter. The sterilizer/retort/process reactors temperature is read every second as accurate control of the same is required. Once the sterilizer/retort/process reactors temperature reaches the set value the indicator for cooking will be ON. The coldest temperature out of the 6 test cans is identified and Fo for this temperature starts accumulating. Once every 30 SL. ..Js the system<br>
isplays the sterilizer/retort/process reactors temperature, Fo and elapsed time. On/Off control is provided for steam. If the temperature goes below the set point the steam valve will be opened otherwise it will be closed. After the set process time of 35 minutes is reached, the • steam valve is closed and cold water valve is opened and now the system checks whether the sterilizer/retort/process reactors temperature is less than 40° C. Once this temperature is reached the cold water valve is closed and drain will be opened. This ends the process which is indicated by audible and visual alarms.<br>
The processed cans were kept at 37° C to test bulging of cans reflecting spoilage if any. The experiments are also conducted in conventional method and storage studies are performed. The results obtained from both the methods are compared and tabulated. The following physico-chemical analysis was carried out for processed peas:<br>

When using the conventional method, Mode 3 was selected during which the process time<br>
was set to 30 minutes and sterilizer/retort/process reactors temperature was set to 116° C. The<br>
process begins by opening Vent and Steam valves. These are indicated by the respective<br>
indicators. The control system will  first check the vent temperature. Once the vent<br>
temperature   reaches   95°C,   the  process   time   module   starts   the   up   counter.   The<br>
sterilizer/retort/process reactors temperature is read every second as accurate control of the<br>

the indicator for cooking will be 'ON. The coldest temperature out of the 6 test cans is<br>
identified and Fo for this temperature starts accumulating. Once every 30 seconds the system<br>
displays the sterilizer/retort/process reactors temperature, Fo and elapsed time. On/Off<br>
control is provided for steam. If the temperature goes below the set point the steam valve will<br>
be opened otherwise it will be closed. After the set process time of 30 minutes is reached, the<br>
steam valve is closed and cold water valve is opened and now the system checks whether the<br>
sterilizer/retort/process reactors temperature is less than 40° C. Once this temperature is<br>

The processed cans were kept at 37° C to test bulging of cans reflecting spoilage if any. The experiments are also conducted in conventional method and storage studies are performed. The results obtained from both the methods are compared and tabulated. The following physico-chemical analysis was carried out for processed beans:<br>
Texture: Texture was measured using Instron Universal Testing machine (model 4301, USA). The samples were compressed to 50 % with a cross head speed of 100 mm/min. The average of six determinations was reported.<br>
Colour: Colour of the samples was measured using Shimadzu colour measuring system Model No. MFC 3100 . The samples were crushed to a fine paste for colour analysis. The colour measurement is reported as L, a and b values.<br>
Carotenoids: The total carotenoids present in carrots was measured as given by Ranganna, S., 1986, Handbook of Analysis and Quality control for fruit and Vegetable products, Tata Mcgraw Hill.<br>

Table 6. Comparative study of the parameters during canning of carrots by the conventional method and by the control system<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
From these studies it is clear that<br>
(I)       The conventional process which is carried out for 20 to 35 minutes and the<br>
corresponding Fo value achieved is very high.<br>
(ii)      Valuable nutrient is destroyed by over processing.<br>
Both the above noted disadvantages are eliminated by on-line monitoring and adequate process time to ensure commercial sterility is ensured, while retaining the valuable nutrients.<br>
The microbiological studies of the cans processed by control system method indicated that, the Fo value achieved is adequate enough to achieve the commercial sterility. The main advantages of the present invention are :<br>
1.	An optimum sterilization can be achieved with on-line monitoring.<br>
2.	The system is compact and economical.<br>
3.	The system can be added on to existing systems without any modifications and<br>
hence facilitate semi-automatic system .<br>
4.	Can be used for both horizontal and vertical sterilizer/retort/process reactors.<br>
5.	The sterilizer/retort/process reactors system can be operated both manually and<br>
automatically.<br>
6.	Commercial sterility can be achieved irrespective of type, size and shape of the<br>
container and food structure.<br><br><br><br><br>
