TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
"COMBINED MEASLES-HUMAN PAPILLOMA VACCINE FOR THERAPEUTIC AND PROPHYLACTIC USE"<br>
We, CADILA HEALTHCARE LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956, of Zydus Tower, Satellite Cross Roads, Ahmedabad-380015, Gujarat, India.<br>
:   The following specification describes the invention<br><br><br><br>
Zydus-Vac-002<br>
Technical Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to combined vaccines against measles and human papilloma virus (HPV).In particular, the invention relates to recombinant measles virus vectors containing heterologous nucleic acid encoding single or several 5 antigens derived from HPV, preferably, the major capside antigen LI, the minor capside antigen L2, the early gene E6 and the early gene E7 oncoproteins of HPV type 16, and optionally of types 18, 6 and 11 such that they induce a potent long-lasting immune response in mammals, preferably humans, to protect against HPV and MV infection.<br>
Background information<br>
10 HPVs belong to a large family of small double-stranded DNA viruses that infect squamous epithelia. (For a-recent comprehensive review on papillomaviruses see Howley, PM and Lowy. DR (2007) in: Fields Virology, fifth edition), eds.-in-chief Knipe, DM. &amp;. Howley, P. M. Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, Philadelphia PA 19106, USA, pp.2299-2354 To date, more than 100 genotypes have been described, among which at least 35 types infect the genital tract. Although most of the HPV types produce benign lesions, a small subset of genotypes is strongly associated with the development of high-<br>
15 grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and cervical cancer. This subset has been identified as "high risk" and it is estimated that HPV-16 accounts for approximately 60% of cervical cancers, with HPV-18 adding another 10%-20%. Other high-risk types include types 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 68, and 73. Low-risk HPVs, such as HPV-6 and HPV-11, cause benign genital warts (90% begnin condylomata accuminata are HPV6 or 11 positive). Bivalent vaccines 16/18 eliminating the most common high-risk types may permit to overcome also the low-risk types. An ideal vaccine<br>
20 would protect against other HPV types through use of antigens from different types and/or antigens containing conserved regions.<br>
The HPV genome encodes eight proteins. The late LI and L2 genes code for capsid proteins; the early proteins El and E2 are responsible for viral replication and transcription, and E4 is involved in virus release from infected cells. The integration of high risk type HPV viral DNA into host genome results in a loss of El or E2 mediated transcriptional<br>
25 control and consequently in an over-expression of the E6 and E7 proteins responsible of the malignant transformation process. Structural protein LI from high risk types represents an optimal target for prophylactic vaccines. On the other hand, E6 and E7 proteins are obvious therapeutic targets.<br>
There are actually several prophylactic HPV vaccine formulations based upon the major viral capsid protein LI, either as a monomer, or as a virus like particle (VLP) from HPV 16 and 18 types and in some cases additional types<br>
30 (W094/00152, W094/20137, WO93/02184 and WO94/05792). VLPs may additionally comprise L2 proteins, for example, L2 based vaccines described in WO93/00436. These vaccines are highly immunogenic and appear safe; however their high cost does not permit generalized access to populations at risk and their HPV type specificity represents another limitation. Therefore, a remaining need exists to develop additional improved vaccines against HPV which should be inexpensive. Moreover vaccinations with antigen mainly induce an antibody specific response that is of little or no benefit<br>
35       on established HPV infection and related-disease.<br>
Approaches involving recombinant viral vector vaccines are under development (Poxvirus, Adenovirus, Alphavirus, Poliovirus e Herpes Virus). Adenovirus based vaccine is described, for example, in US2007269409 (WO2004044176) which encodes the E6 or E7 protein of HPV. The adenovirus based vaccine is able to generate long term immunity; however, integration of HPV DNA into the host genome remains possible and may represent a safety<br>
40 limitation. In view of the above shortcomings the use of measles, virus as a vector to express HPV antigens represents an original strategy to develop a prophylactic combined HPV-measles vaccine as well as a therapeutic HPV vaccine.<br><br><br>
Zydus-Vac-002<br>
Immunisation vectors based on measles virus<br>
Measles virus (MV) is a member of the family Paramyxoviridae. The non segmented genome of MV has an anti-message polarity which results in a genomic RNA which, when purified, is not translated either in vivo or in vitro and is not infectious. 5 MV is a major cause of acute febrile illness in infants and young children. According to estimates of the World Health Organisation (WHO), one million young children die every year from measles. This high toll arises primarily in developing countries, but in recent years also industrialised countries such as the USA have been affected again by measles epidemics, primarily due to incomplete adherence to immunisation programs. At present, several live attenuated MV vaccine strains are in use (including the Schwarz, Moraten and Edmonston-Zagreb strains), almost all derived from<br>
10 the original Edmonston strain by multiple passage in non human cells. MV vaccine is proven to be one of the safest, most stable, and effective human vaccines developed so far. Produced on a large scale in many countries and distributed at low cost through the Extended Program on Immunization (EPI) of WHO, this vaccine induces life-long immunity after a single injection and boosting is effective. Protection is mediated both by antibodies and by CD4 and CD8 T cells. Persistence of antibodies and CD8 cells has been shown for as long as 25 years after vaccination.<br>
15	The recombinant measles virus nucleotide sequence must comprise a replicon  having a total  number of<br>
nucleotides which is a mutiple of six. The «rule of six» is expressed in the fact that the total number of nucleotides present in the recombinant cDNA finally amount to a total number of nucleotides which is a multiple of six, a rule which allows efficient replication of genome RNA of the measles virus.<br>
The heterologous DNA is cloned in the MV vector within an Additional Transcription Unit (ATU) inserted in the<br>
20 cDNA corresponding to the antigenomic RNA of measles virus. The location of the ATU can vary along said cDNA: it is however located in such a site that it will benefit from the expression gradient of the measles virus. Therefore, the ATU or any insertion site suitable for cloning of the heterologous DNA sequence can be spread along the cDNA, with a preferred embodiment for an insertion site and especially in an ATU, present in the N-terminal portion of the sequence and especially within the region upstream from the L-gene of the measles virus and advantageously upstream from the M gene<br>
25       of said virus and more preferably upstream from the N gene of said virus.<br>
The technology permits to produce rescued viruses containing and stably expressing foreign genes suitable for use as combined MV vaccines. As a proof of concept, MV has been used to express antigens derived from SIV, HIV, hepatitis B, mumps, West Nile (WN) Virus and SARSCoV. In most of these studies, recombinant MVs that express heterologous antigens appeared to induce specific humoral neutralizing antibodies in a transgenic mouse model and were<br>
30 shown to induce cellular immune responses to some proteins. At the present, clinical trials with any recombinant vaccine candidate based on MV are only in the planning stage however experimental results support the hypothesis that MV combined vaccines should be as efficient in eliciting long-lasting immune protection against other pathogenic agents as against the vector virus itself. In fact, in the case of MV expressing WNV gpE, a complete protection up to six months has been documented in monkey, and MV expressing a Dengue antigen induced long term production of neutralizing<br>
35 antibodies. Moreover, in transgenic mice and macaques, rescued recombinant MV was capable of inducing specific antibody responses to heterologous antigen in the presence of pre-existing immunity against MV.<br>
Rescued live recombinant MV vaccines are easily produced on a large scale in most countries and can be distributed at low cost. Regarding safety, MV replicates exclusively in the cytoplasm, ruling out the possibility of integration into host DNA. These characteristics make rescued recombinant MV vaccine an attractive candidate to be used as a multivalent<br>
40 vaccination vector for HPV antigens. Adult populations, even already MV immunized individuals, may however also benefit from MV recombinant immunization because re-administering MV virus under the recombinant form of the present invention may result in a boost of anti-MV antibodies<br><br><br>
3<br><br>
Zydus-Vac-002<br>
So far, no approach has been developed to produce a vaccine able to induce immunity against MV combined with immunity against HPV.<br>
The invention relates in particular to the preparation of recombinant measles viruses, bearing heterologous nucleic acid encoding antigens from HPV. 5<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
The object of the invention is the production of combined measles-HPV vaccines from a recombinant Measles vector capable of containing stably integrated nucleotide sequences which code for LI, L2, E6 and/or E7 protein from different HPV types.<br>
10	The invention includes the rescue of recombinant MV-HPV viruses which are capable of infection, replication<br>
and expression of LI, L'2, E6 or E7 protein in susceptible transgenic mice, monkeys and human host.<br>
Furthermore, the invention includes the construction of multivalent recombinant measles-HPV vectors, in which two different antigens are simultaneously cloned and expressed in the same vector, conferring immunity against both of them.<br>
15	Moreover, the invention relates to the combination of different recombinant measles-HPV viruses, each carrying<br>
and expressing a gene from a different HPV type, in order to elicit immune response in the host, directed against the different HPV types.<br>
Furthermore, the invention comprises a method to produce a vaccine containing such recombinant viruses.<br>
The invention finally relates to a vaccine capable to induce a potent and lifelong immune response against HPV 20      and measles virus in human and to prevent from infection and/or treat diseases associated with infection.<br>

The examples describe the invention.<br>
Example 1: construction of recombinant p(+)MV2EZ-HPV and p(+)MV3EZ-HPV plasmids<br>
All cloning procedures were basically as described in Sambrook et a/. (1989). 10      Ad the restriction enzymes were from New England BioLabs; the oligonucleotides PCR primers were from Invitrogen.<br>
The LI sequence is amplified by PCR, and directly cloned into the definitive MV vectors, obtaining two recombinant MV-<br>
HPV16-L1 plasmids: p(+)MV2EZ-HPV-Ll and p(+)MV3EZ-HPV-Ll.<br>
PCR amplification is carried out using the proof-reading Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). DNA sequences of the<br>
synthetic oligonucleotides primers are given in upper case for the MV nucleotides and in lower case for non-MV 15       nucleotides; sequences of relevant restriction endonucleases recognition sites are underlined. The following primers are<br>
used:        FOR-LI	5'        -        ttggcgegccATGAGCCTGTGGCTGCCC        -        3';        REV-LI	5'<br>
atgacgtcTCACAGCTTCCTCTTCTTCCTC - 3'.<br>
For-Ll contains an overhang (in lower case) with BssHll restriction site (gcgcgc), after 3-bp long-protection site (ttg).<br>
Rev-Ll contains an overhang (in lower case) with AatW restriction site (gacgtc). 20       The PCR-HPV16-LI (1536 bp) which is obtained is cloned in the p(+)MVEZ vector between genes for P and M protein or<br>
between H and L, after digestion with B55HII + AatW. Ligations are performed overnight at 16°C in an equimolar ratio<br>
respect to the pre-digested MeV2EZ and MeV3EZ vectors BssHW + AatW (19 Kb in length), using one unit of T4 DNA<br>
Ligase, obtaining, respectively, p(+)MV2EZ-Ll (20561 bp) and p(+)MV3EZ- LI (20561 bp). In figures 1 and 2 are listed,<br>
respectively, the sequences of the vectors p(+)MV2EZ-GFP and p(+)MV3EZ-GFP. 25       XL10 Gold chemical competent cell are then transformed with all ligation volume, following a standard transformation<br>
protocol (Sambrook et al. 1989), plated and selected on LB-Agar plates for ampicillin resistance. Colonies are screened by<br>
DNA plasmid preparation (QIAGEN, mini- midi and maxi kit) and restriction enzymes digestion. The right clones are sent<br>
to MWG for sequencing: the sequences, aligned with the assumed ones using a DNA Strider software, thereby showing<br>
100% identity. Nucleotide sequence encoding for HPV16-L1 is presented in figure 2a. 30       All the other antigens L2, E6, and E7 from HPV 16, and LI, L2, E6, and E7 from HPV 18 and 6 types, are cloned as above<br>
detailed.<br>
The ORFs sequences are listed in figure 2 (2b to 21).<br>

Example 2: cells and viruses<br>
Cells are maintained as monolayers in Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Medium (DMEM),  supplemented with 5% Foetal   Calf     Serum   (FCS)   for   Vero   cells   (African   green   monkey   kidney)   and      with   10%   FCS   and   1% penicillin/streptomycin for 293T cells (human embryonic kidney); DMEM supplemented with Glutamax (F12) and 10% 25       FCS forMRC-5 (human foetal fibroblast); DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and 1.2 mg/ml of G 418 for 293-3-46.<br>
To grow MV virus stocks reaching titers of about 107 pfu/ml, recombinant viruses and the vaccine strain Edmoston Zagreb are propagated in MRC-5 cells: plaque purification is carried out by transferring a syncythium to 35 mm MRC-5 cell culture which is expanded first to a 10 cm dish, and afterwards to a 175 cm flask. Virus stocks are made from 175cm2 cultures when syncythia formation is about 90% pronounced. Medium corresponding to the so-called "free-cell 30 virus fraction" is collected, freeze and thaw three times and spin down to avoid cell debris. The medium is then stored at -80°C. Cells, which correspond to the so-called "cell-associated virus fraction", are scraped into 3 ml of OPT1MEM (Gibco BRL) followed by three rounds freezing and thawing, spin down and the cleared supernatant stored at -80CC.<br>
Example 3: transfection of plasmids and rescue of MV viruses<br>
8<br><br>
Zydus-Vac-002<br>
Recombinant measles-HPV vaccine viruses are obtained using the 293-3-46 helper cell (human embryonic kidney cells), stably expressing the measles N and P proteins as well as the T7 RNA polymerase. The viral RNA polymerase (large protein, L) is expressed by co-transfecting the cells with 15 ng of the plasmid peMCLa. Calcium-phosphate method is used for transfection.<br>
5	293T-3-46 cells are seeded into a 35mm well to reach ~ 50-70% confluence when being transfected. 4 h before<br>
transfection, the medium is replaced with 3 ml DMEM containing 10% FCS. All recombinant plasmids are prepared according to the Q1AGEN plasmid preparation kit. The kit for the Ca2+phosphate coprecipitation of DNA is from Invitrogen.<br>
Cells are co-transfected with the plasmids in the following final concentration: pEMCLa 25 ng and the 10 recombinant p(+)MV2EZ-Ll plasmid 5 µg. All plasmids, diluted in H,0, are added in an Eppendorf tube containing 2M CaCl2, the mix is added to another Eppendorf tube containing HEPES buffer under shaking conditions, and is incubated for 30 min at room temperature (RT). Thus, the co-precipitates are added dropwise to the culture and the transfection is carried out at 37 °C and 5% C02 for about 18h. Then, the transfection medium is replaced with 3ml of DMEM containing 10% FCS.<br>
15	To allow syncytia formation to progress more easily, almost confluent cell monolayers of each 35mm well are<br>
then transferred to a 10 cm dish. Each syncytium is taken up in 300 ul of transfection medium and put in a sterile Eppendorf tube containing 700 µ1 of OPT1MEM, freeze and thaw for three rounds, and stored at -80°C.<br>
Example 4: virus titration by plaque assay<br>
Serial 10-times dilutions of virus preparations are carried out using OPTIMEM to a final volume of 0.5 ml. Each 20 dilution is added on 35 mm Vero cell cultures. After 1 h of virus adsorption, the inoculum is removed and the infected cells are overlaid with 2ml of DMEM containing 5% FCS and 1% low melting point agarose (LMP agarose). After 5 days of incubation at 37°C and 5% C02, cultures are fixed with 1ml of 10% TCA for 1 h, then UV cross-linked for 30 min. After removal of the agarose overlay, cell monolayers are stained with crystal violet dissolved in 4% ethanol, washed with water and the plaques are counted under the inverted microscope.<br>
25       Example 5: MRC-5 virus serial passages of recombinant viruses<br>
Rescued viruses are serially passaged 10-times on MRC5 cells, seeded into 10 cm diameter plates, that are<br>
infected with the standard and the recombinant MV viruses at MOI of 0-01 PFU/cells. After monolayer is full infected, 1%<br>
surnatant of each culture is used to infect the subsequent MRC5 cells monolayer. To test transgene expression and<br>
stability, viruses from passage 1, 5, and 10 are used for further characterisation of expression by Western blot and<br>
30       immunofluorescence.<br>
Isolation of VLPs<br>
Monolayer Vero cells grown are infected at 0,1 MOI with recombinant virus MV2EZ-L1 or negative control virus MVEZ and incubated at 37°. 1 hour after viral adsorption medium is substituted by DMEM containing 5%FCS and incubated at 37° for 48 hours to obtain 90% syncytia. Medium from infected cells are collected, centrifugated and submitted to 35 centrifugation on a 40% (w/v) saccharose layer to separate proteins from particles at 110,00 x g for 2.5 h at 4°. Pellet is solubilised in cesium chloride 27% (w/w) in PBS and analysed on density gradient centrifugation in cesium chloride 27% (w/w) in PBS for 20h at 141,000g at 4°.<br>

Zydus-Vac-002<br><br>
The immunogenic power of the rescued recombinant MV-HPV viruses described is proved by immunisation tests performed on transgenic mice CD46, susceptible for MV infections.<br>
The presence HPVLl-specific antibodies in the sera of immunised CD46 mice iss determined by ELISA assay and by neutralization assay.<br>
. 5<br>
Example 6: Production of a combined measles-malaria vaccine<br>
The working seed of the described recombinant measles-malaria virus is incubated on MRC5 cell monolayer in 1750cm2 roller bottles at 35°C for ten days. The cells are monitored every day for status of health and confluence. On day ten at highest level of syncytia formation, the supernatant is pumped in a steel cylinder for storage in liquid nitrogen. The same 10 procedure is repeated two days later. After performing of all the tests (virus titer, genome stability, virus safety, cell safety, chemical analysis, sterility and others), the harvests is thawed up and mixed with stabilizer containing gelatine, sorbitol, amminoacids and other sugars to final dilution of 105. With a automated filling machine small lyo bottles (F3) are inoculated with 0.5ml each. A specially calculated lyophilisation program is used to guarantee maximal survival of the product during the freeze-drying process.<br>
