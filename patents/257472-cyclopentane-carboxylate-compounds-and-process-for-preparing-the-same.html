Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to cyclopentane carboxylate compounds, to a process and intermediates for preparing the same, and to use thereof. More specifically, die present invention relates to l-hydrocaibyl-2-acyloxy-cyclopent2n.e carboxylate compounds (I), to process for preparing the same, to the intermediate .<br>
Background Art<br>
It has been known to use a Ziegler-Natta catalyst containing. a titaniinn compound and an electron donor compound supported on active magnesium halii e in olefin polymerization. US 4,544,717 teaches that stereospecificity of a catalyst axi be improved by introducing an electron donor compound into a solid component containing a titanium compound. EP 0 045 977 discloses a polymerization catalyst 1: having higher activity and stereospecificity, wherein phthalates are used as intern, 1 electron donor compound, silicone compounds containing at least one Si-OR (wherein R represents alkyl) are used as external electron donor compound, aluminum alkyls are used as cocatalyst.<br>
Many electron donor compounds useful in the preparation of catalysts as well as catalysts for olefin polymerization comprising these donor compounds have been disclosed. For example, EP0361493 and EP0728'24 disclose 1,3-diether compounds, CN 11 05671 A discloses 1,3-diketone compou	nd <br><br>
CN1236372A and CN1292800 discloses specific substituted malonate compounds, W003022894 discloses diesters of maleic acid as electron donor compound. Additionally, CN1446787A and CN1490340A disclose y-acyloxy-substituted ether compounds having a formula (HI), and catalysts for propylene polymerization and exhibiting excellent performance can be prepared using said compounds as internal electron donor added during the preparation of solid component of catalytic system for olefin polymerization through a preparation process similar to that used in the preparation of N-Catalysts (trade name of polypropylene catalyst by Beijing Research Institute of Chemical Industry, SINOPEC, China).<br>
(Figure Removed) However,	known	literatures	disclose	nether<br>
l-hydrocarbyl-2-acyloxy-cyclopentane carboxylate compounds having a gaeral formula (I) as described hereinafter as well as a process for the preparation thereof nor use of the compounds of the formula (I) as electron donor in the preparation of catalysts for olefin polymerization.<br>

Preparation of solid catalyst component:<br>
7 grams of spherical MgCl2«2.6C2H5OH particles having an average particle size of 50/im (prepared according to the process as disclosed in Chinese Patent Application CN1330086A) were added into 80ml of hexane to form a suspension. The suspension was cooled to -20°C, and a mixture of 20ml of hexane and 20ml of TiCLt was added thereto. Then the reaction mixture was warmed to 20°C and reaction mixture was heated to 120°C and maintained at that temperature for 2 k urs, then the liquid when hot was filtered off by suction. The solids were washed ^^vith hexane at 50-60°C for three times, and at room temperature for two times, vith the amount of hexane used being 60 ml for each time. Then the spherical solids dried at 40 °C under vacuum for 2 hours, to give a spherical solid catalyst conporient Example 50-55 and electron donor compound used therein were shown in Table<br>

and 1.5Kg of liquid propylene were then introduced. With, the reactor was heated to 70°C within 5 minutes, and the polymerization was performed at that temperature for 2 hours. After stopping the stirrer and removing unpolymerized propylene monomer, polymer was collected. The polymer was dried at 70°C under vacuum for 2 hours, then weighed to calculate the activity per hour of the catalyst (AC). Isotacticity of the polymer (LI) was measured by boiling niheptane extraction method, and melt index of the polymer (M.I) was measured according to GB/T3682-2000 standard test. Polymerization results are shown in Table 1.<br>
