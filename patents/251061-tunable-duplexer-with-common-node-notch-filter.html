DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0017]	The word "exemplary" is used herein to mean "serving as an example, instance,<br>
or illustration." Any embodiment described herein as "exemplary" is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments.<br>
[0018]	Note that the exemplary embodiment is provided as an exemplar throughout this<br>
discussion, however, alternate embodiments may incorporate various aspects without departing from the scope of the present invention. Specifically, one embodiment is applicable to a data processing system, a wireless communication system, a mobile IP network and any other system desiring to receive and process a wireless signal.<br>
[00l9]	Wireless communication systems are widely deployed to provide various types<br>
of communication such as voice, data, and so on. These systems may be based on Code Division-Multiple Access (CDMA), Time Division-Multiple Access (TDMA), or some other modulation techniques. A CDMA system provides certain advantages over other types of systems, including increased system capacity.<br>
[0020]	A wireless communication system may be designed to support one or more<br>
standards such as the "TIA/EIA/IS-95-B Mobile Station-Base Station Compatibility Standard for Dual-Mode Wideband Spread Spectrum Cellular System" referred to herein as the IS-95 standard, the standard offered by a consortium named "3rd<br><br>
WO 2006/121551	PCT/US2006/013120<br>
Generation Partnership Project" referred to herein as 3GPP, and embodied in a set of documents including Document Nos. 3GPP TS 25.211, 3GPP TS 25.212, 3GPP TS 25.213, and 3GPP TS 25.214, 3GPP TS 25.302, referred to herein as the W-CDMA standard, the standard offered by a consortium named "3rd Generation Partnership Project 2" referred to herein as 3GPP2, and TR-45.5 referred to herein as the cdma2000 standard, formerly called IS-2000 MC.<br>
[0021]	The systems and methods described herein may be used with High Data Rate<br>
(HDR) communication systems. An HDR communication system may be designed to conform to one or more standards such as the "cdma2000 High Rate Packet Data Air Interface Specification," 3GPP2 C.S0024-A, Version 1, March 2004, promulgated by the consortium "3rd Generation Partnership Project 2." The contents of the aforementioned standard are incorporated by reference herein.<br>
[0022]	An HDR subscriber station, which may be referred to herein as an Access<br>
Terminal (AT), may be mobile or stationary, and may communicate with one or more HDR base stations, which may be referred to herein as Modem Pool Transceivers (MPTs). An access terminal transmits and receives data packets through one or more modem pool transceivers to an HDR base station controller, which may be referred to herein as a Modem Pool Controller (MPC). Modem pool transceivers and modem pool controllers are parts of a network called an access network. An access network transports data packets between multiple access terminals. The access network may be further connected to additional networks outside the access network, such as a corporate intranet or the Internet, and may transport data packets between each access terminal and such outside networks. An access terminal that has established an active traffic channel connection with one or more modem pool transceivers is called an active access terminal, and is said to be in a traffic state. An access terminal that is in the process of establishing an active traffic channel connection with one or more modem pool transceivers is said to be in a connection setup state. An access terminal may be any data device that communicates through a wireless channel or through a wired channel, for example using fiber optic or coaxial cables. An access terminal may further be any of a number of types of devices including but not limited to PC card, compact flash, external or internal modem, or wireless or landline phone. The communication channel through which the access terminal sends signals to the modem pool transceiver is called<br><br>
WO 2006/121551	PCT/US2006/013120<br>
a reverse channel. The communication channel through which a modem pool transceiver sends signals to an access terminal is called a forward channel.<br>
[0023]	FIG.   1 illustrates an example of a communications system 100 that supports a<br>
number of users and is capable of implementing at least some aspects of the embodiments discussed herein. Any of a variety of algorithms and methods may be used to schedule transmissions in system 100. System 100 provides communication for a number of cells 102A-102G, each of which is serviced by a corresponding base station 104A-104G, respectively. In the exemplary embodiment, some of the base stations 104 have multiple receive antennas and others have only one receive antenna. Similarly, some of the base stations 104 have multiple transmit antennas, and others have single transmit antennas. There are no restrictions on the combinations of transmit antennas and receive antennas. Therefore, it is possible for a base station 104 to have multiple transmit antennas and a single receive antenna, or to have multiple receive antennas and a single transmit antenna, or to have both single or multiple transmit and receive antennas.<br>
[0024]	Remote stations 106 in the coverage area may be fixed (i.e., stationary) or<br>
mobile. As shown in HG. 1, various remote stations 106 are dispersed throughout the system. Each remote station 106 communicates with at least one and possibly more base stations 104 on a forward link and a reverse link at any given moment depending on, for example, whether soft handoff is employed or whether the terminal is designed and operated to (concurrently or sequentially) receive multiple transmissions from multiple base stations. Soft handoff in CDMA communications systems is well known in the art and is described in detail in U.S. Patent No. 5,101,501, entitled "Method and System for Providing a Soft Handoff in a CDMA Cellular Telephone System," which is assigned to the assignee of the present invention.<br>
[0025]	The forward link refers to transmission from a base station 104 to a remote<br>
station 106, and the reverse link refers to transmission from a remote station 106 to a base station 104. In the one embodiment, some of the remote stations 106 have multiple receive antennas and others have only one receive antenna. In HG. 1, base station 104A transmits data to remote stations 106A and 106J on a forward link; similarly base station 104B transmits data to remote stations 106B and 106J, base station 104C transmits data to remote station 106C, and so on.<br><br><br>
WO 2006/121551	PCT/US2006/013120<br>
[0026]	FIG.  2 is a block diagram of the base station 202 and mobile station 204 in a<br>
communications system. A base station 202 is in wireless communications with the mobile station 204. As mentioned above, the base station 202 transmits signals to mobile stations 204 that receive the signals. In addition, mobile stations 204 also transmit signals to the base station 202.<br>
[0027]	FIG.   2 further illustrates a forward link, which may also be referred to as a<br>
downlink 302, and a reverse link, which may also be referred to as an uplink 304. The<br>
downlink 302 refers to transmissions from the base station 202 to the mobile station<br>
204, and the uplink 304 refers to transmissions from the mobile station 204 to the base<br>
station 202.	<br>
[0028]	An embodiment of a mobile station 204 is shown in a subscriber unit system 400<br>
illustrated in the functional block diagram of FIG. 3. The system 400 includes a processor 402 which controls operation of the system 400. The processor 402 may also be referred to as a Central Processing Unit (CPU). Memory 404, which may include both Read-Only Memory (ROM) and Random Access Memory (RAM), provides instructions and data to the processor 402. A portion of the memory 404 may also include Non-Volatile Random Access Memory (NVRAM).<br>
[0029]	The system 400, which is typically embodied in a wireless communication<br>
device such as a cellular telephone, also includes a housing 406 that contains a transmitter 408 and a receiver 410 to allow transmission and reception of data, such as audio communications, between the system 400 and a remote location, such as a cell site controller or base station 202. The transmitter 408 and receiver 410 may be combined into a transceiver 412. An antenna 414 is attached to the housing 406 and electrically coupled to the transceiver 412. Additional antennas (not shown) may also be used. The operation of the transmitter 408, receiver 410 and antenna 414 is well known in the art and need not be described herein. The tunable duplexer with a common node notch filter will be described below.<br>
[0030]	The system 400 also includes a signal detector 416 used to detect and quantify<br>
the level of signals received by the transceiver 412. The signal detector 416 detects such signals as total energy, pilot energy per Pseudo-random Noise (PN) chips, power spectral density, and other signals, as is known in the art.<br>
[0031]	A state changer 426 of the system 400 controls the state of the wireless<br>
communication device based on a current state and additional signals received by the<br><br><br>
WO 2006/121551	PCT/US2006/013120<br>
transceiver 412 and detected by the signal detector 416. The wireless communication device is capable of operating in any one of a number of states.<br>
[0032]	The system 400 also includes a system determinator 428 used to control the<br>
wireless communication device and determine which service provider system, the wireless communication device should transfer to when it determines the current service provider system is inadequate.<br>
[0033]	The various components of the system 400 are coupled together by a bus system<br>
430 which may include a power bus, a control signal bus, and a status signal bus in addition to a data bus. However, for the sake of clarity, the various busses are illustrated in FIG. 3 as the bus system 430. The system 400 may also include a Digital Signal Processor (DSP) 407 for use in processing signals. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the system 400 illustrated in FIG. 3 is a functional block diagram rather than a listing of specific components.<br>
[0034]	The methods disclosed herein may be implemented in an embodiment of a<br>
subscriber unit 400. The disclosed systems and methods may also be implemented in other communication systems with a receiver, such as a base station 202. If a base station 202 is being used to implement the disclosed systems and methods, the functional block diagram of FIG. 4 may also be used to describe components in a functional block diagram of a base station 202.<br>
[0035]	FIG. 4 is an overall block diagram of a tunable duplexer system 500 in a mobile<br>
station 204 or in a subscriber unit 400. The system 500 receives and sends signals through an antenna port 502. The duplexer 504 is in electronic communication with the antenna port 502 and with the receive path (RX Path) 506 and the transmit path (TX Path) 508. The transmit 508 and receive 506 paths are electrically connected to the duplexer 504 in parallel via a common node 610 (shown in FIG. 5). The duplexer 504 performs both transmit and receive filtering. The duplexer 504 is designed to avoid leakage of the transmit signals into the receive path 506 and to avoid leakage of the receive signals into the transmit path 508. The duplexer disclosed herein isolates the transmit and receive signals with a simple topology.<br>
[0036]	FIG. 5 is a more detailed block diagram of an embodiment of a tunable duplexer<br>
system 600. The antenna port 502 is electrically connected to a common node 610. The transmit path 608 and the receive path 606 are electrically connected in parallel to the common node 610. The common node 610 is electrically connected to the input port of<br><br>
WO 2006/121551	PCT/US2006/013120<br><br>
a tunable single-pole band reject filter 612 on the receive path 606. The output port of the receive path band reject filter 612 is connected to the input port of a tunable two-pole band pass filter 614. In concept a higher order filter could be used, but the ability to tune and control high order filters is more difficult and, as a result, it may be desirable to avoid a higher order filters in some scenarios. The output of the receive path band pass filter 614 is then provided to a low noise amplifier 615 and a demodulator 616.<br>
[0037]	The transmit path 608 includes a modulator 622. The signal from the modulator<br>
622 is fed into a power amplifier 623 which is connected to a transmit path tunable two-pole band pass filter 620 that is tuned at the transmit frequency. As mentioned with respect to the receive path 606, in concept a higher order filter could be used, but the ability to tune and control high order filters is more difficult and, as a result, higher order filters may be avoided in some scenarios. The output port of the transmit path band pass filter 620 is connected to the input port of a transmit path tunable single-pole band reject filter 618. Similar to the receive path 606 the output port of the transmit band reject filter 618 is also electrically connected to the common node 610.<br>
[0038]	As shown, the duplexer 600 includes dual two-pole band pass filters 614, 620<br>
connected to a common node 610 by embedding a band reject filter 612,618 in each RF path 606, 608 that behaves as an open circuit to the undesired frequency. In the receive path 606, the receive band pass. filter 614 is preceded by a band reject filter 612 that is an open circuit at the transmit frequency. The reflection coefficient of the band reject filter 612 is set to one at zero degrees phase.<br>
[0039]	Likewise in the transmit path 608, the transmit band pass filter 620 is followed<br>
by a band reject filter 618 that is an open circuit at the receive frequency. The reflection coefficient of the band reject filter 618 is set to one at zero degrees phase.<br>
[0040]	FIG. 6 is a flow diagram of one embodiment of a method for tuning a duplexer<br>
600 using a common node notch filter in a mobile station. The mobile station 204 is provided at step 702 with new transmit and/or receive frequencies. One situation where this may occur is where the mobile station 204 is moving from one coverage area on one channel to another coverage area that uses a different channel. The base station 202 provides the new transmit and/or receive frequencies to the mobile station 204.<br>
[0041]	Once the new transmit and/or receive frequencies are obtained, the mobile<br>
station 204 tunes its filters at step 704. A number of different tuning operations are performed during this tuning step (704). The mobile station 204 tunes the band reject<br><br><br>
WO 2006/121551	PCT/US2006/013120<br>
filter 618 on the transmit path 608 to the receive frequency so that it rejects the receive frequency. The band pass filter 620 on transmit path is also tuned to the transmit frequency to pass the transmit frequency.<br>
[0042]	The mobile station 204 tunes the band reject filter 612 on the receive path 606 to<br>
the transmit frequency so that it rejects the transmit frequency. The band pass filter 614<br>
on the receive path 606 is also tuned to the receive frequency to pass the receive<br>
frequency. Once the filters have been tuned to the appropriate frequencies, then the<br>
mobile 204 may start normal call processing operation at step 712, and it may continue<br>
normal operation until it is again required to change either the transmit and/or receive<br>
frequencies.	<br>
[0043]	Those of skill in the art would understand that information and signals may be<br>
represented using any of a variety of different technologies and techniques. For example, data, instructions, commands, information, signals, bits, symbols, and chips that may be referenced throughout the above description may be represented by voltages, currents, electromagnetic waves, magnetic fields or particles, optical fields or particles, or any combination thereof.<br>
[0044]	Those of skill would further appreciate that the various illustrative logical<br>
blocks, modules, circuits, and algorithm steps described in connection with the embodiments disclosed herein may be implemented as electronic hardware, computer software, or combinations of both. To clearly illustrate this interchangeability of hardware and software, various illustrative components, blocks, modules, circuits, and steps have been described above generally in terms of their functionality. Whether such functionality is implemented as hardware or software depends upon the particular application and design constraints imposed on the overall system. Skilled artisans may implement the described functionality in varying ways for each particular application, but such implementation decisions should not be interpreted as causing a departure from the scope of the present invention.<br>
[0045]	The various illustrative logical blocks, modules, and circuits described in<br>
connection with the embodiments disclosed herein may be implemented or performed with a general purpose processor, a Digital Signal Processor (DSP), an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) or other programmable logic device, discrete gate or transistor logic, discrete hardware components, or any combination thereof designed to perform the functions described<br><br><br>
WO 2006/121551	PCT/US2006/013120<br>
herein. A general purpose processor may be a microprocessor, but in the alternative, the processor may be any conventional processor, controller, microcontroller, or state machine. A processor may also be implemented as a combination of computing devices, e.g., a combination of a DSP and a microprocessor, a plurality of microprocessors, one or more microprocessors in conjunction with a DSP core, or any other such configuration.<br>
