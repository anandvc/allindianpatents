The invention relates to a "exture-coated sixjjuci, ^J  ct process for its preparation and to its use<br>
An. aerogel-like textured silica is known f r£m DiLJ2£_A£~-£3-$. That siiica is prepared by incorporating water with uniform distribution, into an air-dispersed fumed siiica and drying the resulting pulverulent mixcure.<br>
That silica has the disadvantage that Ax  has a pronounced tendency to sedimentation and can be re disdersed onlv with difficulty or not at ail.<br>
Document j)E 15 92 363 describes organically modified precipitated silicas which are coated, for example, with a wax and can be used as delustering agents. Those known silicas exhibit poor transparency in various lacquer systems. Owing to their nigh moisture content, those silicas cannot be used An moisture-curing polyurethane systems. Lacquer systems that cannot readily be delustered, such as poly^rethane and epoxy lacquer systems, cannot be delusteted satisfactorily using the known silicas.<br>
The object is, therefore to prepare a silica that does not exhibit those disadvantages.<br>

Of the fumed silicas listed' in Table  1,   there  can preferably be used all types of Aerosil  with  he exception of  AEROSIL OX50,   including' the uncomoressed Variants.<br>
Thermoplastic elastomers  can be used as coating agent. The  thermoplastic elastomers can be  used in the  form of aqueous  and or solvent-containing dispersions. Particular preference  is  given to  the  use,   as  thermoplastic elastomers,   of'"dimethylpolysiloxane  elastomers  having terminal  epoxy groups,   especially having  a molecular weight of  greater than' 100,000.<br>
The  thermoplastic  elsatomers  can be  prepared by:<br>
(I)   mixing,<br>
(A)	a rheologically stable polyamide resin having a melting point or glas^s transition temperature of 25.degree.c to 278. degree. c,<br>
(B)	a silicone base comprising<br>
(Bf) 100 parts by weight of a diorganopolysiloxane gum having a plasticity of at least 30 and having an average of At  least 2 alkenyl groups in its molecule and<br>
(Blf) 5 to 200 parts by weight of a reinforcing filler, the weight ratio of said silicone base to said polyamide resin beinq greater than 35:65 to 85:15,<br>
(C)	for each 100 parts by weight of said polyamide resin,<br>
a compatibilizer selected from<br>
(i) 0.1 to 5 parts by weight of a coupling agent having a molecular weight of less than 800 which contains at least two groups independently selected from ethylenically unsaturated group, epoxy, anhvririHp. .qi'flnoL carboxvL oxazoline or alkoxy<br><br>
having 1 to 20 carbcn atoms, in its molecule-<br>
(ii) 0.1 to 10 parts by weight of a functional diorganopolysiloxane having at least one group selected from epoxy, anhydride, silanol  carboxyl, amine, oxazoline or alkoxy having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, in its molecule, or<br>
(iii) from 0,1 to 10 parts by weight of a copolymer comprising a~ least one diorganopolysiloxane block and at least one block selected from polyamide, polyether, polyurethane, polyurea, polycarbonate or polyacrylate,<br>
(D)	an organohydrido silicon compound which contains an<br>
average of a" least 2 silicon-bonded hydrogen groups<br>
in its molecule and<br>
(E)	a hydrosilation catalyst,<br>
components (D) and {E)   being present in an amount sufficient to cure said diorganopolysiloxane (B'); and (II) dynamically curing said diorganopolysiloxane (B'). The invention further relates to a thermoplastic elastomer whtch is prepared by the above method.<br>
Component (A) of the  present invention is a thermoplastic polyamide resin. These resins are well known by the generic term "nylon" and are long chain synthetic polymers containing amide (i.e., —C(O)—NH—) linkages along the main polymer chain. For the purposes of the present invention, tne polyamide resin has a melt point (m.p.), or glass transition temperature (Tg) if the polyamide is amorphous,  of room temperature (i.e., 25 °C ) to 275 °C Attempts TO prepare TPSiV elastomers from polyamides having higher melt points (e.g., nylon 4 6) resulted in poor physical properties, the ultimate elongation of such<br><br>
products being less than the required 25% according to the present invention. Furthermore, for the purposes of the' present invention, the polyamide resin is preferably dried . by passing a dry, inert gas over resin pelLets or powder at elevated temperatures. The degree of drying consistent with acceptable properties and processing debends on the particular polyamide and its value is generally recommended by the manufacturer or may be determined by a few simple experiments. It is generally preferred that the polyamide resin contains no more than, about O.l weight percent of moisture. Finally, the polyamide must also be rheologically stable under the mixing conditions required to prepare the .TPSiV elastomer, as described infra. This stability is evaluated on the neat resin at  the appropriate processing temperature and a change of more than 20% in melt viscosity (mixing torque.)- within the t me generally required to prepare the corresponding TPSiVs (e.g., 10 to 30 minutes in a bowl mixer) indicates that the resin is outside the- scope of the present invention Thus, for example, a dried nylon 11 sample having a m.p of 198 °C was. mixed, in a bowl mixer under a nitrogen gas purge at about 210 to 220 °C for about 15 minutes and the observed mixing torque increased by approximately 200%  Such a polyamide resin is not a suitable Candidate for the instant method.<br>
Other than the above mentioned limitations, resin (A) can be any thermoplastic crystalline or amorphous high molecular weight solid homopolymer, copolymer or terpolymer having recurring amide units within the polymer chain. In copolymer' and terpolymer systems, more than 50 mole percent of the  epeat units are amide-containing units. Examples of suitable polyamides are polylactams such as nylon 6, polyenantholactam (nylon .7), polycapryllactam (nylon 3), polyluryllactam (nylon 12), and the like; homopolymers of aminoacids such as polypyrrolidinone (nylon 4) ; copolyamides of dicarboxylic acid and diamine such as nylon 6 6, polyhexamethyleneazelamide (nylon 6 9) ,<br><br>
pclyhexamethylene-sebacamide (nylon 6 10 pclyhexamethyleneisophthalamide (nylon 6,1<br>
polyhexamethylenedodecar.cic acid (nylon 6 12)   and the like; aromatic and partially aromatic polyamides; copolyamides such as copolymers of caprolactam and<br>
hexamethyleneadipanu.de nylon 6,6 6) , oh  a terpolyamice (e.g., nylon 6,6 6,6);-clock copolymers such as polyether pclyamides; or mixtures "hereof. Preferred polyamide resins are nylon 6, nylon 12, nylon 6 12 and nylon 6 6.<br>
Silicone base (B) is a uniform blend of a diorganopolysiloxane gum (B1) and  a reinforcing filler (B") .<br>
Diorganopolysiloxane (B!; is a high consistency (gum) polymer or copolymer which contains at least 2 alkenyl groups having 2 to 2 0 carbarn atoms in its molecule. The alkenyl group is specifically exemplified by vinyl, allyl, burenyl, pentenyl, hexenyl and decenyl The position of the alkenyl functionality is not critical and it may be bonded at the molecular chain terminals, in non-terminal positions on the molecular chaan or at both positions. It is preferred that the Alkenyl group is vinyl or hexenyl and that this group is  present at a level of 0.001 to 3 weight percent, preferably 0.01 to 1 weight percent, in the diorganopolvsiloXne gum.<br>
The remaining (i.e., non-alkenyl) silicon-bonded organic groups in component (B') are independently selected from hydrocarbon or halogenated hydrocarbon groups which contain no aliphatic unsaturation. These may be specifically exemplified by alkyl groups having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl and hexyl; cycloakyl groups, such as cyclohexyl and cycloheptyl; aryl groups having 6 to 12 carbon atoms, such as phenyl, tolyl and ^ylyl; aralkyl groups having 7 to 20 carbon atoms, such as l6enzyl and phenethyl; and halogenated alkyl groups having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, such as 3, 3, 3-trifluoropropyi<br><br>

and chloromethyl. It will be understood, of course, that<br>
these groups are selected such that the     <br>
diorganopolysiloxane gum (B') has a glass temperature (or<br>
melt point) which is below room temperature and the gum is<br>
therefore eiastomeric. Methyl preferably makes up at lease<br>
50, more preferably at least 90, mole percent of the non-<br>
unsaturated silicon-bonded organic groups in component<br>
(B').	 <br>
Thus, polydiorganosiloxane (B') can be a homopolymer or a copolymer containing such organic  groups. Examples include gums comprising dimethylsiloxy units and phenylmethylsiloxy units; dimethylslloxy units and diphenyisiloxy units; and dimethylslloxy units, diphenyLsiloxy units and phenylmethylsiloxy units, among others. The molecular structure is also not critical and is exemplified by straight-chain and partially branched straight-chain, linear structures being preferred.<br>
Specific illustrations of organopolysiloxane (B1) include: trimethylsiloxy-endblocked dimethylsiloxane-methylhexenylsiloxane copolymers; dimethylhexenlylsiloxy-endblocked dimethylsiloxane-methylhexenylsiloxane copolymers; trimethylsiloxy-endblocked dimethylsiloxane-methylvinylsiloxane copolymers; trimethylsiloxy-endblocked methylphenylsiloxane-dimethylsiloxane-methylvinylsiloxane copolymers; dimethylvinylsiloxy-endblocked dimethylpolysiloxanes; dimethyl vinylsiloxy-endblocked dimethylsiloxane-methylvinylsiloxane copolymers; dimethylvinylsiloxy-endblocked methylphenylpolysiloxanes ; dimethyl vinylsiloxy-endblocked methylphenylsiloxane-dimethyleiloxane-methylvinylsiloxane copolymers; and similar copolymers wherein at least one  end group is dimethilhydroxysiloxy. Preferred systems for low temperature applications include methylphenylsiloxane-dimechylsiloxane-methylvinylsiloxane copolymers and<br><br>
and chloromethyl. It will be understood, of course, that these groups are selected such that the<br>
diorganopolysiloxane gum (B') has a glass temperature (or melt point) which is below room temperature and the gum is therefore eiastomeric. Methyl preferably makes up at leasr 50, more preferably at least 90, mole percent of the non— unsaturated1silicon-bonded organic groups in component (Bf ) .<br>
Thus, polydiorganosiloxane (B') car  be a homopolymer or a copolymer containing such organic groups. Examples include gums comprising dimethylsiloxy units and phenylmethylsiloxy units; dimethylsiloxy units and diphenyisiloxy units; and dimethylsiloxy units, diphenyLsiloxy units and phenylmethylsiloxy units, among others. The molecular structure is also not critical and is exemplified by straight-chain and partially branched straight-chain, linear structures being preferred.<br>
Specific illustration of organopolysiloxane (B') include: trimethylsiloxy-endocked dimethylsiloxane-methylhexenylsiloxane copolymers; dimethylhexenlylsiloxy-endblocked dimethylsiloxane-methylhexenylsiloxane copolymers; trimethylsiloxy-endblocked dimethylsiloxane-methylvinylsiloxane copolymers; trimethylsiloxy-endblocked methylphenylsiloxane-dimethylsiloxane-methylvinylsiloxane copolymers; dimethylvinylsiloxy-endblocked dimethylpolysiloxanes; dimethylvinylsiloxy-endblocked dimethylsiloxane-methylvinylsiloxane copolymers; dimethylvinylsiloxy-endblocked methylphenylpolysiloxanes ; dimethylvinylsiloxy-endblocked methylphenylsiloxane-dimethylsiloxane-methylvinylsiloxane copolymers; and similar copolymers wherein at least one end group is dimethylhydroxysiloxy. Preferred systems for low temperature applications include methylphenylsiloxane-dime hylsiloxane-methylvinylsiloxane copolymers and<br><br>
diphenylsiloxane-dimethylsiloxar.e-methylvinylsiloxane copolymers, particularly whereir. the mriflr content of the dimethylsiloxane units is abou~ 93%.<br>
Component (B1) may also consist of combinations of two or more organopolysilcxanes. Most preferably, component (37 ) is a polydimethylsiloxane homopolyme  which is terminated with a vinyl group at each end of its  molecule cr is such a homopolymer which also contains at least one vinyl group along its main chain.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, the molecular weight of the diorganopolysiloxane gum is sufficient to impart a Williams plasticity  number of at least about 30 as determined by the American Society for Tesoing and Materials (ASTM) test method 926. The plascicity number, as used herein,- is defined a^ the thickness in millimeters. times,. 100 of a  cylindrical test specimen 2 cm  in. volume and approximately 10 mm in height after the specimen has been subjected to a compressive load of 4 9 Newtons for three minutes at 25 °C.<br>
When the plasticity oi this component is less than abou~ 30, as in the case of the low viscosity fluid siioxanes employed by Arkles',  cited supra, the TPSiVs prepared by dynamic vulcanization according to the instant method exhibit poor uniformity such that at high silicone contents (e.g., 50 to 70 weight percent) there are regions of essentially only silicone and those of essentially only thermoplastic resin, and the blends are weak and friable. The gums of the present invention are considerably more viscous than the  silicone fluids employed in the prior art. For example, silicones contemplated by Arkles, cited supra, have an upper viscosity limit of 100,000 cS (0.1 m2 s) and, although the  plasticity of fluids of such low viscosity are not readily measured by the ASTM D 926 procedure, it was determined that this corresponds zo  a plasticity of<br><br>
approximately 24. Although there is no absolute upper limit on the plasticity of component (B'), practical considerations of processability in conventional mixing equipment generally restrict this value, trererably, the plasticity number should be about ICO to 200, most preferably about 120 to 185.<br>
Methods for preparing high consistency unsaturated group-containing polydiorganosiloxanes are well known and they do not require a detailed discussion in this specification. For exampler   a typical method for preparing an alkenyl-functional polymer comprises the case-catalyzed equilibration of cyclic and or linear diorganopoiysiloxanes in the presence of similar alkenyl functional species.<br>
Component <b is a finely divided filler which known to reinforce diorganopolysiloxane and preferably selected from heat stable minerals such as fumed precipitated forms of silica aerogels titanium dioxide having- j specific surface area at least about m2 gram.></b>
The fumed form of silica is a preferred reinforcing filler based on its high surface area, which can be up to 450 m2 gram and a fumed silica having a surface area of 50 to 400 m2 g, most preferably 200 to 380 m2 g, is highly preferred. Preferably, the fumed silica filler is treated to render its surface hydrophobic, as typically practiced in the silicone rubber art. This can be accomplished by reacting the silica with a liquid organosilicon compound which contain^ silanol groups or hydroyzable precursors of silanol groups. Compounds that can be used as filler treating agents, also referred to as anti-creeping agents or plasticizers in the silicone rubber art, include such ingredients as low molecular weight liquid hydroxy- or alkoxy-terminated polydiorganosiloxanes, hexaorgapiodisiloxanes, cyclodimethylsiiazanes and hexaoroanondisilazanes. It is referred  that the creatine<br><br>
compound is,, an oligomeric hydroxy-terminated<br>
diorganopolysiloxane having an average degree of<br>
polymerization (DP) of 2 to about 100, more preferably<br>
about 2 co about 10 and it is used at a level of about 5 to<br>
50 parts by weight for each 100 parts by weight of the<br>
silica filler- When component (B') is the preferred vinyl-<br>
functional or hexenyl-functional polydimethyisiioxane, this<br>
treating agent is preferably a hydroxy-terminated<br>
polydimethylsiloxane.	 <br>
For the purposes of the present invention, 5 to 200 parts by weight, preferably 5 to 150 and most preferably 20 to 100 parts by weight, of the reinforcing filler (B") are uniformly blended with 100 pa&amp;ts by weight of gum (B') to prepare silicone base (B) . This blending is typically carried out at room temperature using a two-roll mill, internal mixer or other suitable device, as well known in the silicone rubber art. Alternatively, the silicone base can be formed in-situ during mixing prior to dynamic vulcanization of the gum, as further described infra. In the latter case, the temperature of mixing is kept below the softening point or melting point of the polyamide resin until the reinforcing filler is well dispersed in the diorganopolysiloxane gum.<br>
The compatibilizer (C) may be a coupling agent, an organofunctional diorganopolysiloxane or a siloxane copolymer. For the purposes of the present invention, at least one compatibilizer is included in the preparation of the thermoplastic elastomer.<br>
In one embodiment, the compatibilizer is (i) a coupling agent having a molecular weight of less than 800 which contains at yeast two groups in its molecule which are independently selected from ethylenically unsaturated groups {e. g. , vinyl, allyl, butenyl, pentenyl, hexenyl, acrylate and methacrylate) , epoxy, anhydride, silanol, hydroxyl, alkoxy having 1 to 2D. nreferably from 1 to 10,<br><br>
more preferably from 1 to 4, carbon atoms,  carboxyl or oxazoline. The latter group has the structure<br>
wherein the carbon atoms of the. ring may contain one or more substituents selected from hydrocarbon groups having 1 to 4 carbon atoms. The coupling aqent can have an organic or<br>
siloxane-based skeletal structure As long as it contains at least two of the above mentioned groups, these being located at.terminal positions, along the backbone or both. In the case of siloxane backbones, the above mentioned functional organic groups (i.e , r.on-silanol) are attached to silicon atoms via Si—C bonds {e.g., through a divalent hydrocarbon group such as trimethylene, tetramethylene and dimethylene) or a divalent organic group containing oxygen and or nitrogen heteroatoms such as ester, ether or amide. Although the groups may be the same, it is generally preferred that at least one of these is an ethylenically unsaturated group, preferably vinyl, while at least one other group is selected from the above mentioned epoxy, anhydride, alkoxv, silanol, hvdroxyi, carboxyl or oxazoline groups.<br>
Examples of suit	*w -w^**-^ -gents include allyl glycidyl<br>
ether, glycidyl methicrylate, 1,2-epoxy-7-octene, 1,2-epoxy-9-decene, l,27epoxy-5-hexene, allyl succinic anhydride, vinyloxazolines, vinyloxazoline derivatives such as 2-isopropenyl-2-oxazoline, gamma-glycidoxypropylme£hyldimethoxysilane, gammaglycidoxypyltrimethoxysilane,- beta- (3, 4-epoxycyclohexyl ethyltrimethoxysilane, 1, 3-phenylene-bis (2-oxazoline),  poly(propylene glycol)diglycidyl ether, diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A, tris(2,3-<br><br>
epoxypropy)isocyanurate and unsaturated  diamides  such  as CH2=CH-(qH2)8"CO-NH-(CH2)o-NK-GO-(CH2)3-CH=C^2r   inter  alia.<br>
The  concentration of these  coupling  agents  can be   from 0.1 to  5  parts  by weight  for each  100  parts by weight  of  the polyamide   (A) ,   preferably,   from 0.2  to  3   parts  by weight.<br>
In  another  embodiment,   the  compatibilizer   is   (ii)   a functional  diorganopolysiloxane haying  a  number average molecular weight of at least   800, preferably  800  to  50,000, more preferably, from 800  to   15,(100.   The   functional diorganopolysiloxane   (ii). is  polymer  or  copolymer  in which the  organic groups  are  independently  selected  from hydrocarbon  or halogenated hydrocarbon  groups  which contain no  aliphatic unsaturation,   as  described  above  for component (B1)    including preferred Embodiments  thereof.

In the case of compatibilizers (i)   and (ii) , it is sometimes preferred to mix the compatibilizer with the ■ polyamide resin at a temperature above the melt point of the resin prior to addition of  the silicone base. While not wishing to be held to. any theory or mechanism, it is believed that this procedure results in a reaction between the functional groups of the compatibilizer and either the amide or end groups of the resin, thereby maximizing compatibilization efficiency.

The above additives are typically added to the final thermoplastic composition after dynamic cure, but they may also be added at any point in  the preparation provided they do not interfere with the dynamic vulcanization mechanism. Of course, the above additional ingredients are only used at levels which do not significantly detract from the desired properties of the final composition.<br>
According to the method of the present invention, the thermoplastic elastomer is prepared by thoroughly dispersing silicone base (B) and.compatibilizer (C) in polyamide (A) and dynamically vulcanizing the diorganopolysiloxane in the base using organohydrido silicon compound (D) and catalyst (E) . For the purposes of the present invention, the weight ratio of silicone base (B) to polyamide resin (A) is greater than 35:65. It has been found that when this ratio is 35:65 or less, the resulting vulanizate generally has a modulus more resembling the  polyamide resin than a thermoplastic elastomer, on  the other hand, the above mentioned ratio should be no  more than about 85:15 since the compositions tend to Joe  weak and resemble cured silicone elastomers above this value. Notwithstanding this upper limit, the<br><br>
maximum ratio of (B) to (A) for any given. combination of components is also limited by processability considerations since too high a silicone base content results in at least a partially crosslinked continuous phase which is no longer thermoplastic. For the purposes of the present invention, this practical limit is readily determined by routine experimentation and represents the highest level of component (B) which allows the TPSiV to  be compression molded- It is, however, preferred that the final thermoplastic elastomer can also be readily processed in other conventional plastic operations, such as injection molding and extrusion and, in thisr case, the weight ratio of components (B) to (A) should be no more than about 75:25. Such a preferred thermoplastic elastomer which is subsequently re-processed often has a tensile strength and elongation which are within 10% of the corresponding values for the original TPSiV (i.e., the thermoplastic elastomer is little changed by re-prooessing) . Although the amount of silicone base consistent with the above mentioned requirements depends upon £he  particular polyamide resin and other components selected, it is preferred that the weight ratio of components (B) to (A) is 40:60 to 75:25, more preferably 40:60 to 70:30.<br>
Mixing is carried out in  any device which is capable of uniformly dispersing the components in the polyamide resin, such as an internal mixer or a twin-screw extruder, the latter being preferred for commercial preparations. The temperature is preferably kept as low as practical consistent with good mixing so as not to degrade the resin. Depending upon the particular system, order of mixing is generally not critical and, for example, components (A) , (C) , (D) and, optionally, (F) can be added to (B) at a temperature above the softening point (i.e., melt point or glass temperature) of (A), catalyst (E) then being introduced to initiate dynamic vulcanization. However, components (B) through (F) should be well dispersed in<br><br>
resin. (A) before dynamic vulcanization begins. As previously mentioned, it is also contemplated that the silicone base can be formed in-situ. For Example, the reinforcing filler may be added to a mixer already containing the polyamide resin and diorganopolysiloxane gum at a temperature below the softening point of the resin to thoroughly disperse the filler in the gum. The temperature is then raised to melt the resin, the other ingredients are added and mixing dynamic vulcanization are carried out. Optimum temperatures, mixing timed  and other conditions of the mixing operation depend upon the particular resin and other components under consideration and these may be determined by routine experimentation by those skilled in the art. It is, however, preferred to carry out the mixing and dynamic vulcanization under a dry, inert atmosphere (i.e., one that does not adversely react with-the components or otherwise interfere with the hydrosilation cure), such as dry nitrogen, helium or argon.<br>
As noted above, in order to be within the scope of the present invention, the tensile strength or elongation, or both, of the TPSiV elastomer must be at least 25% greater than that of a corresponding simple blend. A further requirement of the invention is that the TPSiV has at least 25% elongation, as determined by the test described infra. In this context, the term "simple blend" (or physical blend) denotes a Composition wherein the weight proportions of resin (A) , baase (B) and compatibilizer (C) are identical to the proportions in the TPSiV, but no cure agents are employed (i.e.,  either component (D) or (E) , or both, are omitted and the gum is therefore not cured) . In order to determine if a  particular composition meets the above criterion, the tensile strength of the TPSiV is measured on dumbbells having a length of 25.4 mm and a width of 3.2 mm and a typical thickness of 1 to 2 mm, according to ASTM method D fl2,   at an extension rate of 5-0 mm min. At least three such samples are evaluated and the results averaged<br><br>
after removing obvious low readings due to sample inhomogeneity (e.g., such as voids, contamination or inclusions). These values are then compared  to the corresponding average tensile and elongation values of a sample prepared 'from the simple blend composition. When at least a 25% improvement in tensile and oy elongation over the simple blend is not realized there ils  no benefit derived from the dynamic vulcanization and such TPSiVs are not within the scope of the present invention.<br>
The thermoplastic elastomer prepared by the above described method can then be processed by conventional techniques,. such as extrusion, vacuum forming,  injection molding, blow molding, overmolding or compression molding. Moreover, these compositions can be re-processed (recycled) with little or no degradation of mechanical properties.<br>
Because the volume of the silica decreases only slightly when the water and the coating agent are incorporated, it is to be assumed that the originally present association of the primary particles of the air-dispersed fumed silica is substantially retained. The charging with water and of the coating material probably leads to the start of dissolution of the silica surface, so that dissolved silica is present there. During the subsequent drying operation, that dissolved silica cementi the primary particles to their points of contact.    <br>
Thus, by charging a fumed silica in a targeted manner with water and the coating agent and subsequently drying it, there forms a substance corresponding to Kistler's aerogels which is stable to dispersion and has a high macropore volume and a very low apparent density (bulk weight).<br>
It has further been found that the apparent structure present before the  incorporation of the water and the coating agent, determined by the packing density of the fumed silica in air, which structure is expressed by its<br><br>
apparent density (bulk weight), has a pronounced influence on  the product obtainable by the process according to the invention: the more bulky the starting product, the more bulky the end product that is obtained.    <br>
I" has proved advantageous to use fumed silica having a<br>
camped density of from 10 to 130 g 1, {preferably from 15 to<br>
33 g 1, especially about 20 g 1, to, prepare the products<br>
according to the invention.	 <br>
In addition, it is found to be advantageous to choose fumed silica having a large surface area and hence small primary particles. According to an advantageous embodiment of the process according to the invention, silica having BET surface areas of from 100 to 480 m2 g, especially from 250 to 410 m2 g, is used.         <br>
Complete wetting of the primary particles can be achieved if only from 5 to 20 wt.%, especially from 7 to 15 wt.%, water and the coating agent are incorporated into the silica with uniform distribution. Because the water that has been incorporated hai to be removed again by drying, it is desirable for economic reasons to use a minimal amount of water. However, the required amount is dependent to a certain extent on the nature of the incorporation.<br>
The building up of the  texture according to the process of the invention can pa  markedly promoted if compounds having a basic reaction, such as, for example, ammonia, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, water-soluble amines, water glass or the like, are added to the water and the coating agent. The amonnts added are advantageously so chosen that a pH value of from 7 to 14, preferably from 8 to 12, especially from 10 to 11, is established in the water.<br>
The alkali  used act as solubilizers for silica and bring about an increase in the macroporosity of the process products <br><br>
Instead of alkaline compounds, it is also possible to add<br>
to the water and the coating agent free silica or<br>
hycrolytic silica and or substances that liberate alkali.<br>
Free silica, for example silica produced by acidification<br>
or ion exchange of silicate solutions or by hydrolytic<br>
cleavage of organiosiliccn compounds, for example of<br>
tetramethyl 'silicate, likewise promotes the building up of<br>
the texture. An example of a substance that liberates<br>
alkali and silica hydrolytically is sodium<br>
methylsiliconate♦	 <br>
Uniform distribution of the water and the coating agent in the silica can be carried out by adding them dropwise or spraying them into the silica  which is in mixing movement, at temperatures of the silica of from 20 to 100°C, preferably from. 40 to 70°C, especially from 50 to 60°C. The mixing movement is advantageously effected by stirring.<br>
A further variant of the introduction of water consists in spraying the water and the  coating agent into the silica in a fluidized mass stream , for example using a down pipe.<br>
It has also proved advantageous to carry out the charging with water at moderacely elevated temperatures. This can be effected either by preheating the water that is to be incorporated with the coating agent, or by preheating the silica, or by preheating both components. For example, the water to be incorporated with the coating agent can have a temperature of from 20 to 100°C, preferably from 50 to 100°C, especially from 90 to 100°C.<br>
The building up of the texture can also be promoted by steaming the charged silica for a short time in a closed chamber. .The steaming leads to particularly good distribution of the water. It has proved advantageous to steam the silica charged with water, before it is dried, in a close vessel for approximately from 5 to 60 minutes, preferably from 10 to 30 minutes, especially for about<br><br>
20 minutes, at temperatures up to the boiling point of the water, preferably from 50 to 80°C, especially about 60°C.<br>
A further possible method of improving the distribution of<br>
the 'water and of the coating agent consists in milling the silica charged with the water and the coating agent, for example in pinned disk mills or air-jea mills.<br>
Drying is then carried out, during whion. the preformed texture is presumably fixed by way of the primary particles which have begun to dissolve at the surface or which are coated at the surface with free silica.<br>
The nature of the drying is not critical.<br>
It is possible to dry the resulting mixture of silica and water and coating agent, which phenomonologically always resembles a dry powder, in, for example, a rack drier, a disk drier, a Buttner drier, a flow drier or a microwave drier. However, it is also possible for the silica charged with water and coating agent to be milled and dried simultaneously in a steam ot water-jet mill, with'a separate process step thus being saved.<br>
If separate drying of the  pulverulent mixture obtained after charging with water and coating agent is carried out, it can be followed by dry milling in a pinned disk mill or an air-jet mill.      <br>
The silica according to the invention can be used as a delustering agent in  lacguers, whereby it has the following advantages:      <br>
•	no sedimentation, or ready re-dispersibility,<br>
•	the lustering efficiency is not impaired,<br>

DIN 66 131 using nitrogen.	 <br>
Tamped density	 <br>
Determination of the tamped density following DIN ISO<br>
787 XI	 <br>
Fundamental principles cf the tamped density determination The tamped density (formerly tamped valume) is equal to the quotient of the weight and the volume of a powder after tamping in a. tamping volumeter: under„ defined-conditions. According to DIN ISO 787 XI  the ramped density is given in g cm . Because of the very low tamped density of the oxides, the value herein is given in g 1. Furthermore, drying and screening and repetition of the tamping operation are not carried out.<br>
Devices for determining the tamped. density<br>
tamping volumeter         <br>
measuring cylinder       <br>
laboratory balance (readable to 0.01 g)<br>
Carrying out the tamped density determination<br>
200 ± 10 ml of oxide are introduced into the measuring<br>
cylinder of the tamping volumeter in such a manner that no<br>
spaces remain and the surface is horizontal.<br>
The weight of the introduced sample is determined to an<br>
accuracy of 0.01 g.   The measuring cylinder containing the<br>
sample is placecd into the measuring cylinder holder of the<br>
tamping volumeter and tamped 1250 times.<br>
The volume of the  tamped oxide is read off to an accuracy<br>
of 1 ml.      <br><br>

Reagents for determining the pH value  <br>
distilled or demineralised water, pH &gt; 5.5<br>
methanol, p.a.	 <br>
buffer solutions pH 7.00 pH 4.66   <br>
Devices for determining the pH value<br>

glass beaker, 250 ml	 <br>
magnetic stirrer	 <br>
magnetic rod, . length 4 cm     <br>
combined pH electrode        <br>
pH meter	 <br>
Dispensette, 100 ml         <br>
Procedure for determining the pH value<br>
The determination is carried out following DIN ISO 787 IX: Calibration: Before the pH value is measured, the meter is calibrated with the buffet solutions. If several measurements are carried out in succession, it is sufficient to calibrate the meter once.<br>
4 g of hydrophilic oxide are stirred in a 250 ml glass<br>
beaker with 96 g (96 ml)   of water with the aid of a<br>
Dispensette and for five minutes by means of a magnetic<br>
stirrer (speed about 1000 min-1) with the pH electrode<br>
immersed.	 <br>
4 g of hydrophobic oxide are made into a paste with 48 g (61 ml) of methanol in a 250 ml glass beaker, and the suspension is diluted with 48 g (48 ml) of water and<br><br>
stirred for five minutes by means of a magnetic stirrer (speed about 1000 min-1) with the pH electrode immersed. After the stirrer has been switched off,   the pH value is read off after the mixture has been allowed to stand for one minute. The result is read off to one decimal place.<br>
Loss on drying	 <br>
In contrast to the weighed portion of 10 g mentioned in DIN ISO 787 II, a weighed portion of i g is used for determining the.loss on drying, <br>
The cover is fitted before cooling is carried out. A second drying operation is not carried out.<br>
About 1 g of the sample is weighed, to an accuracy of 0.1 mg, avoiding the formation of dustf into a weighing pan which has a ground-glass cover and has been dried at 105°C, and is dried for two hours at 105°C in a drying cabinet. After cooling with the cover in place in a desiccator over blue gel, the samole isr re-weighed.<br>
g loss in weight<br>
% loss on drying at  105°C = *x 100<br>
'        g initial weight<br>
The result is read off to one decimal place.<br>
Ignition loss<br>
Devices for determining the ignition loss<br>
porcelain crucible with crucible lid<br>
muffle furnace<br>
analytical balance (readable to 0.1 mg)<br>
desiccator <br>
Carrying out the determination of the ignition loss Debartina from DIN 55 9-21, 0.3 to 1 g of the material,<br><br>
which has not been pre-dried, is weighed  to an accuracy of<br>
0.1 mg, into a porcelain crucible, having a crucible lid,<br>
which has previously been ignited, and is ignited for<br>
2 hours at 1000°C in a muffle furnace, <br>
The formation of dust is carefully to be avoided. It has<br>
proved advantageous for the weighed Samples to be placed<br>
into the muffle furnace while it is still cold.<br>
More pronounced air turbulence in the porcelain crucibles<br>
is avoided by slow heating of the furnace.<br>
After 1000°C has been reached, the sample is ignited<br>
further for 2 hours. The crucible is then covered with a<br>
crucible lid and the ignition loss of the crucible is<br>
determined in a desiccator ovsrr blue gel.<br>
Evaluation of the icnition loss determination<br>
Because the ignition loss, is based on the sample dried for<br>
2 hours at 105°C, the calculation formula is as follows:<br>
 l00 - LD<br>
m0 x -  mi<br>
     100<br>
% ignition loss =hx 100<br>
   100 - LD<br>
rao x   <br>
       100<br>
m0 = initial weight  g)<br>
LD = loss on drying (%)<br>
mi = weight of the ignited sample (g)<br>
The result is read off to one decimal place.<br>
DBF number     <br>
Devices for determining the DBP number . .<br>

Dibutyl phthalate   (commercial  grade}<br>
Implementation<br>
1.	Checking of the switch-off point<br>
-Switch on  the plastcgraph without the  metering pump. -Open the flap covering the operating element (beneath<br>
the display)	<br>
between the switch-off value "1000" and the alarm "AI<br>
H.A.",'after 5 seconds the display returns to normal<br>
mode.	<br>
2.	Calibration	<br>
-Switch on the plastcgraph without the metering pump. -Switch on the kneader (press both Start buttons<br>
simultaneously-With the "Cal" button depressed press the "Funk"<br>
button once, the display alternates between the<br>
current zero point ana "Lo S.C.". -Press the "Cal" button again, after four seconds<br>
(calibration) the device displays the current overall<br>
range "10000" and "Fu S.C". -Press the "Cal" button again, after four seconds<br>
(calibration) the device shows the friction-corrected<br>
zero point "tare"  -Press the "Cal" Button again and wait 5 seconds. -Carry out the steps "Switch-off point" and<br>
"Calibration operation" once daily as required before<br>
the measurements!<br>
3.	Measurement   <br>
-12.5 g sample are weighed into a poly-beaker and placed into  the kneading -chamber. If instructed, a different initial weight may also be used (e.g. 8 or 2-0 g) . The DB? metering unit is switched on. As soon<br><br>
as the, filling procedure (display F) is  complete, the<br>
plastograph is ready for operation. - The measurement begins by simultaneous pressing of the<br>
Start buttons.	-The metering unit meters in 4 ml of DBP min until the<br>
switch-off point that has been set (1000) is reached. -The device switches off automatically. -The DBP consumption can now be read off on the display<br>
of the metering device.<br>
Calculation<br>
Dosimat display x 1.047  x 100 DBP (%)  = <br>
initial weight (g)<br>
Always give the result together with the initial weight.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></td>
