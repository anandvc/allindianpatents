FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a two way CNC Horizontal Machining center used for machining the component in different setups.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Demand for higher flexibility, reduced cycle time and increased precision, together with low cost per piece ratio are often the challenges posed in providing machining solutions, especially in sectors like engine manufacturing, auto component machining etc.<br>
It becomes all the more critical when it comes to machining of heavier engine blocks in different models, with its variants in a single machine for multiple operations on different faces of the block.<br>
DISCUSSION OF PRIOR ART<br>
Existing Method:<br>
At present, these components, like cylinder blocks are machined in different machines for different faces and operations, like radial drilling, multiple spindle Special Purpose Machines (SPM) etc), in different set ups.<br>
Achieving accuracies with several set up changes in a sustained manner on a production basis is a challenge for the manufacturers. The cost per piece is also substantially very high.<br>
To achieve higher accuracy levels in machining and also to reduce the costs in production, the present invention proposes a novel two way CNC special purpose horizontal machining center.<br>
Advantages of the Present Invention:<br>
With this two-way machining concept, the challenges of providing machining solutions at a reduced cycle time, increased precision, low cost per piece with higher flexibility can be easily achieved, in a single set up.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Machine construction:<br>
The machine consists of the following modules:<br>
?	Main machine (RH &amp; LH side)<br>
?	Central Machine<br>
?	Automatic tool changer and Tool magazine<br>
?	CNC system &amp; Electrical cabinet<br>
?	Coolant system with chip conveyor<br>
?	Pneumatic system &amp; Hydraulic system<br>
?	Guards<br>
MAIN MACHINE (RH &amp; LH side):<br>
This module consists of the following parts:<br>
Machine Bed:<br>
This is a sturdy steel fabricated structure, which is stress relieved to maintain the machine accuracy for years. This supports all the three axes drives and the spindle, and has been designed keeping in mind the efficient disposal of the chips and collection of lubrication oil from various machine elements like axes drives, LM guides etc.<br>
Cross slide:<br>
This structure is made of spheroidal graphite (SG) iron box type casting for high rigidity and is stress relieved. This unit moves on the LM guides mounted on the main bed and is driven by a servomotor through a high accxiracy ball screw (045) constituting the X-axis of the machine. The ball screws are mounted on precision angular contact bearings, which are lubricated for life and are coupled to the servomotor using flexible coupling.<br><br>
The ball nut is oil lubricated. The position sensing is done through the absolute encoder built into the servomotor and the travel limits are constrained in three stages using limit switches, software limits and mechanical stoppers.<br>
Vertical column;<br>
This is a sturdy steel fabricated structure and is stress relieved to maintain the machine accuracy for years. This moves on the LM guides mounted on the cross slide and is driven by a servomotor through a high accuracy ball screw (dia45) constituting the Z-axis of the machine. The ball screws are mounted on precision angular contact bearings, which are lubricated for life and are coupled to the servomotor using flexible coupling. The ball nut is oil lubricated. The position sensing is done through the absolute encoder built into the servomotor and the travel limits are constrained in three stages using limit switches, software limits and mechanical stoppers. This structure carries the hydraulic counter balancing arrangement for the vertical slide<br>
Vertical slide;<br>
This is a rigid box type stress relieved high-grade cast iron structure. This moves on the LM guides mounted on the vertical column and is driven by a servomotor through a high accuracy ball screw (dia45) constituting the Y-axis of the machine. The ball screws are mounted on precision angular contact bearings, which are lubricated for life and are coupled to the servomotor using flexible coupling. The ball nut is oil lubricated. This carries the spindle cartridge and the spindle drive arrangement. The position sensing is done through the absolute encoder built in to the servomotor and the travel limits are constrained in three stages using limit switches, software limits and mechanical stoppers. The hydraulic counter balancing arrangement ensures that in case of a sudden power failure during the machining operation the spindle will not drop, hence avoiding damage to the tools and the machine.<br>
Spindle;<br>
This houses a spindle with BT 50 taper rotating on 3 numbers of dialOO high precision angular contact ball bearings, lubricated for life. The bearings are protected from dirt and coolant by labyrinth seals and an air curtain. The tool clamping is done using disc springs<br><br>
and collet arrangement and the de-clamping is done by means of a hydraulic cylinder. The de-clamping arrangement has been designed to protect the bearings from the declamp force. The spindle cartridge also houses the coolant nozzles, which can be manually set to direct the coolant to any desired location. The spindle feedback is through an encoder driven through a flexible coupling.<br>
The spindle drive is powered by a servomotor, through a two-speed ZF (1:1 &amp; 1:4) gearbox. This reduction is achieved by helical planetary gear arrangement for compactness and low noise and the gearbox is capable of changing the gears in less than two seconds.<br>
On the bottom side of the front flange of the spindle cartridge, a hole is provided for the coolant to drain. If this drain hole is blocked by any dirt or chip particles, the coolant may enter inside and damage the spindle bearings.<br>
Automatic tool changer and Tool magazine :<br>
The tool magazine is of chain type with 40 swiveling tool pockets mounted on the chain. The magazine is indexed by an electric motor through a drum cam. A pneumatic cylinder mounted on a stationary plate in the center of the magazine is used to swivel the pocket into the tool change position.<br>
Tool changer arm is twin gripper type whose movements are obtained by a combination of two movements i.e. axial and angular. These movements are generated with the help of a globoidal cam and a flat cam. Cams are driven by electric motor through a reduction gear train. One revolution of camshaft completes the tool change cycle.<br>
CENTRAL MACHINE:<br>
Central Machine bed:<br>
This is a sturdy steel fabricated structure, which is stress relieved to maintain the machine accuracy for years. This supports a central table slide with hydromotor and ball screw drive for slide. This base has slopes, which diverts the flow of coolant and chips to chip conveyor.<br><br>
Table slide is a rigid stress relieved high-grade cast iron structure, which moves on hardened and ground steel guide ways. The drive for the central table slide, is through a rolled ball screw and hydromotor. The slide is with button clamps and is actuated at the machining position so that the slide does not get disturbed during the machining of the component. Above the central slide, the hydraulic fixture is mounted, which can accommodate four and six cylinder blocks for machining of the head face, bottom face and bearing cap seat face.<br>
CNC System &amp; Electrical Cabinet;<br>
A 'FANUC OiMA controller controls the machine. The controller and electrical cabinet are placed on the rear side of the machine. An operator panel consisting of display panel and controls is provided on LH and RH side of the machine. Emergency buttons are provided at various places to stop the machine during emergency.<br>
Coolant system with chip conveyor;<br>
The machine is provided with a scraper type chip conveyor with a coolant tank with sufficient coolant capacity. The coolant system has a magnetic separator with paper band filtration system with the filtration level being upto 20 microns.<br>
Pneumatic, Hydraulic system;<br>
The pneumatic system requires air compressed to 6 bar as input and is used for spindle taper cleaning, air curtain for spindle, etc. The hydraulic system is powered by a 301pm, 63 bar power pack and is used for spindle tool declamping, fixture, central axis slide movement etc.<br>
Lubrication System;<br>
This unit provides metered lubrication for slides, lead screw, fixture elements etc., at preset time intervals. An oil level indicator is provided to monitor the oil level in the unit. A float switch in this unit actuates the 'OIL LEVEL LOW indicator on the control panel.<br><br>
Machine Guards:<br>
The machine is provided with a safety guard, which has been designed keeping in view the maintenance - with easily removable panels for easy approach to maintenance areas and leak proofing of the machine<br>
