				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a mobile communication system and, more particularly, to a device and method for transmittin J powp- -"d bit patterns to allow a mobile station to distinguish a transmit antenna in a mobile communication system that employs transmission diversity.<br>
2.	Description of die Related Art<br>
Transmit antenna diversity techniques are generally characterized by three feaWrs: (1) a base station simultaneously sends common pilot signals to a mobile station wherein each common pilot signal uses a different spreading sequence in accordance with a particular transmit antenna at the base station (2) one user's data signal is transmitted via only one antenna among the plurality of ar.tennaa; and (3) the mobile station must have some prior knowledge about the identity of the transmit anterrfl that the base station is currently using to transmit the user's data to the mobile station. If the mobile station does not have such knowledge it must othenvise correctly estimate the identity of the transmit antenna.<br>
With regard to the third feature, as previously stated, the mobile station must have some prior knowledge about the identity of the antenna currently used by the base station for data transmission, or otherwise be able to estimate the amemi&amp;'s<br><br>
identity by means of received signals from the base station In either case, it is necessary for the base station to send to the mobile station supplementary information about the transmit antenna.<br>
Conventionally, the method for sending supplementary information about the transmit antenna involves the uu- ef uwr-specific pilot symbols at the base station As is well known in the art, communication systems that use pilot signals may be generally divided into two classes: a first class whereby different pilot signals are used according to each user communicating with the base station, and a second class whereby a common pilot channel is shared by all users. The common pilot channel system cannot be used to send information auuul the u Ansmn antenna, since it is shared by all users.<br>
IC is generally known that to perform reverse link power control, the bast* station, after puncturing a data signal, inserts a power control bit (PC6) in iht punctured data signal and transmits the modified signal to the mobile station. The present invention discloses a method which exploits the existing PCB bit insertion method to provide additional information to the mobile station about the transmit antenna to facilitate the implementation of transmission antenna diversity<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a device and method for eeneratim* fl Hiffrrrnt PPR ngft^rrt according to 5 transmit *Ttt;"na ZV.&amp; communicating the generated PCB pattern in a mobile communication system employing the transmit antenna diversity technique.<br>

It is another object of the present invention to provide a device and method for identifying a transmit antenna from PCB that is modulated by specific antenna identifying pattern.<br>
To achieve the above object of the present invention, there is provided a device and an associated method for communicating data between a base station having at least two transmit antennas, and a mobile station having at least one receive antenna in a mobile communication system, the device includes: a transmitter at the base station, for Inserting power control bit (PCB) patterns into the data and sending the data with the PCB patterns inserted therein, the PCB. patterns indicating one transmit antenna being used to transmit the data; and a receiver at the mobile .station, for receiving the data, detecting the PCB patterns from the received data and determining the one transmit antenna from the detected PCB patterns<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described liereinbelow with reference to the accompanying drawings, in the following description, well known functions or constructions are not described in detail since they would obscure the invention in unnecessary detail.<br>
Overview<br>
In a mobile communication system that employs the transmit antenna diversity technique, the mobile station must have correct information about the particular transmit antenna used to transmit data at the base station in order to perform a successful data demodulation. And if the mobile station could identify the transmit antenna, the mobile station could send antenna select signal to the base station which is service to the mobile station. To accomplish this, the present invention enables the mobile station to identify the transmit antenna by using an identifying PCB pattern which is inserted in the punctured data during data transmission. The PCB pattern is generated by modulating PCB with specific bit pattern, for example orthogonal code. The present invention is advantageous in that it precludes the need to use control signals separately exchanged between the base station and the mobile station in order to acquire information about the transmit<br>
_   4   _<br><br>
antenna.<br>
Generally described, the transmitter sends one of a plurality of PCB patterns to the mobile station. The particular PCB pattern transmitted corresponds to the antenna being currently used by the base station to transmit the data. Each PCB pattern is associated with one of the transmit antennas and each pattern has the property of being orthogonal with every other PCB pattern thereby permitting the mobile station to readily identify the corresponding transmit antenna. The receiver extracts the PCB pattern using the orthogonality property of the PCB patterns so as to obtain both power control information and transmit antenna information.<br>
Briefly summarized, the present invention transmits supplementary information about the transmit antenna being currently used for transmit the data signal to the mobile by the base station by means of the PCB pattern inserted in the punctured transmission data. In particular, the base station, after puncturing transmission data, inserts a PCB in the punctured data and transmits the data to the mobile station, in order to perform reverse link power control. The method has applicability for those situations where the mobile station is not aware of the particular transmit antenna being currently used for data transmission by a base station. The method has applicability to both a mobile communication system configured as a common pilot channel structure.<br>

Referring to FIG. 1, a signal converter ) 11 demultiplexes input code symbol into an inpnase channel (l-channel) and a quadrature phase channel (Q-channel) and outputs the multiplexed datsi as first and second channel signals. Also, the signal converter 111 converts the level of symbol data, i.e.. from "0" to "+1" and from "1" to "-I". Here, the coded symbol input into the signal converter 111 is symbol data received through encoders and interleavers, etc.<br>

A second inserter 115 receives the outputs of the second channel gain controller 113 and the PCB gain controller 121. The second inserter 115 punctures data at a predetermined position ofthe output signal of the second channel gain controller 113 based on the selection ofthe bit selector and then inserts the PCB pattern output from the PCB gain controller 121 in the punctured position.<br>

A PN code generator 126 generates two PN codes PN_I and PN_Q and , outputs them to a complex PN spreader 125. The complex PN spreader 125 complex-number multiplies the outputs of the multipliers 122 and 123 by the PN codes PNJ and PN_Q. A switch 127 is used to implement the transmit antenna diversity technique so as to transmit the output signal of the complex PN spreader 125 to first and second transmitters 128 and* 129 in accordance with a control signal for transmit antenna diversity. The first and second transmitters 128 and 129 perform an ordinary low-pass filtration for confining transmission signals to within a predetermined bandwidth; convert the low-pass filtered signals to radio frequency signals and then transmit the radio frequency signals to the corresponding antenna.<br>

As is well known in the an, reverse link power control is a power control<br>
method whereby the mobile station controls its transmission power according to<br>
PCB patterns received from the base station. For example, upon receiving a PCB<br>
pattern of +1+1", the mobile station would increase the transmission power; and<br>
upon receiving a PCB pattern of "-1-1", the mobile station would decrease its<br>
transmission power. As previously stated the PCB patterns aie constructed to be<br>
onhoeonal with *"ar,K nrW    A" s"c^ e^h PCB uniquely identifies one of the<br>
transmission antenna* deployed at the base station. For example, the PCB pattern<br>
thai increases, or decreases, the transmission power for the mobile station received<br>
via the first antrrna is detenr&gt;i""l by multiplying the PCB bit (+1 for an increase<br>
in pr.vtr ?r * for" icww** "o puwct; increasing, or decreasing, the transmission<br>
power for the mobile station by"+1+1" that corresponds to the first antenna pattern.<br>
In contrast, the PCB pattern that decreases (or increases) the transmission power for<br>
die mobile station received via the second antenna is determined by multiplying the<br>
PCB (+1 or -I) decreasing (or increasing) the transmission power for the mobile<br>
station by "-H-I" that corresponds to the second antenna ratterr;. As a result, ihe<br>
PCB patterns change according to the transmit antenna and have orthogonality wiih<br>
oKcli; tf::i TT at is, the PCB pattern generator according to the present invention<br>
generates the PCB patterns to be orthogonality with each other according "o the<br>
transmit antenna.<br>
Far example, if the first antenna pattern ^as.-i.mvJti. Le H : \ the second antenna pattern may be chosen to be "+1-I" in order to maintain orthogonality between the antenna patterns. The outputs of the PCB pattern generator 116 are shown in Table 1.<br>
-   9   -<br><br><br>
[Table 1]<br>
When the PCBs are determined, the PCB gain controller 121 controls the gain ofthePCBs output from the PCB pattern generator 116. The inserters 114 and 115 then insert the gain controlled PCBs in the data for the correspon(fir:fc, channel*, respectively. That is, the inserters II Hand 115 puncture symbols at a predetermined position of Hie channel data and insert the PCBs in the punctured position. The multipliers 122 and f 23 multiply the corresponding inpjt channel signals by the Orthogonal codes output from ate orthogonal code generator 124. respectively<br>
-   10   -<br><br>
Here, the orthogonal codes may be Walsh codes or quasi-orthogonal codes<br>
The complex PN spreader 125 complex-number multiplexes the outputs of the multiplexers 122 and 123 by the PN codes PN_! and PNQ, respectively The switch 127 transfers the output signal of the complex PN spreader 125 to the first transmitter 128 or to the second transmitter 129 in accordance with a transmission diversity control signal. Finally, the first and second transmitters 128 and 129 convert the punctured transmission signal with the antenna-specific PCBs inserted therein, to a radio frequency signal, which is then sent to the corresponding antenna.<br>
In general, when utilizing a transmit antenna diversity technique in a mobile communication system, all transmit antennas situated at the base station continuously send a pilot signal specific to each transmitting antenna. The mobile station receives the pilot signals from each of the transmit antennas The mobile station checks on all the received pilot signals so as to determine whether the received signals from the antennas are of a high quality or not That is. the mobile station checks on the quality of signals for all channels and requests the base station to communicate data on a high quality channel. Upon receipt of the request from the mobile station, the base station transmits data nn the specific channel that the mobile station requested. However, some requests from the mobile station are not transferred successfully to the base station due to sudden impairment of the channel. Upon failure to receive the requests of the mobile station, the base station sends data to any antenna, since it has no knowledge about which channel can provide a high quality signal- As a result the mobile station cannot demodulate trie data using information about the desired transmit antenna and has to correctly<br>
- 11  -<br><br>
estimate the transmit antenna from the data received from the base station<br>
The present invention such an estimation capability. That is, the present invention allows the mobile station to acquire knowledge about the antenna in current use by the base station. Such estimation capability is achieved by the base station sending a PCB pattern corresponding to the antenna being currently utilized to perform data transmission. The mobile station detects the received PCB pattern in order to acquire a knowledge about the antenna that the base station currently uses for data transmission.<br>
In connection with FIG. 2, reference will now be made to the description of a receiver at the mobile station for detecting a PCB pattern from received data and determining a data transmit antenna.<br>
First, a receiver 211 converts a radio frequency signal, received from the base station via the antenna, to a base band signal A PN code generator 225 generates two PN codes, PN_I and PN_Q and outputs them to a complex PN despreader 212 The complex PN despreader 212 performs a complex PN despread by complex-number multiplying the output of receiver 211 by the PN codes PNI and PN_Q.<br>
An orthogonal code generator 214 generates orthogonal codes corresponding to the orthogonal code number "W#" (i.e WO, Wl, W2,...etc. )and the orthogonal code length. Here, the orthogonal codes may be Walsh codes or quasi-orthogonal codes A multiplier 213 multiplies the output signal of the complex PN despreader 212 by the orthogonal codes generated from the orthogonal code generator 214 to perform an orthogonal despread.<br>
-   12   -<br><br>
An integrator 215 sums the output of the multiplier 213 for a penod equal to a symbol interval to generate a value for symbol estimation. A PCB extractor 216 extracts a PCB signal from the output signal of the integrator 215 and outputs the extracted PCB signal to a PCB pattern detector 217. Also, the PCB extractor 216 sends the extracted PCB signal to a demodulator 225, which then demodulates the base band signal into a data signal. Here, the received signal is compensated for the magnitude and phase distortion thereof according to channel estimating information previously stored. The PCB pattern detector 217 detects the PCB pattern from the dcspread signal and uses the detected PCB pattern to determine which transmit antenna is currently used to transmit the input signal.<br>
Here, the PCB pattern detector 217 is composed of antenna pattern generators 218 and 219, multipliers 220 and 221, integrators 222 and 223, and a detector 224. The antenna pattern generators 218 and 219 generate corresponding antenna patterns. The multiplier 220 multiplies the output of the PCB extractor 216 by the output of the first antenna pattern generator 218, In contrast, the multiplier 221 multiplies the output of the integrator 215 by the output of the second antenna pattern generator 219. The first integrator 222 integrates the output signal of the multiplier 220 and dumps the integrated signal, while the second integrator 223 integrates the output of the multiplier 221 and dumps the integrated signal. The detector 224 determines a true transmit antenna from the output signals of the integrators 222 and 223 and provides the result to a system controller (not shown). Here, the detector 224 output provided to the system controller is used to obtain channel estimating information, which is in turn used to compensate the received signal for magnitude and phase distortion Thereafter, the output signal from the demodulator is restored to the original data through a decoding process<br>
-   13   -<br><br>
Next, a more detailed description will be made in connection with FIG. 2 to describe the operation of the mobile station for detecting a PCB pattern to determine a data transmit antenna.<br>
First, the receiver 211 converts a radio frequency signal, received from the base station via the antenna, to a base band signal. The complex PN despreader 212 complex-number multiplies the output of receiver 211 by the PN codes PNI and PN_Q to perform a complex PN despread, The multiplier 213 multiplies the output signal of the complex PN despreader 212 by the orthogonal codes generated from the orthogonal code generator 214 to perform an orthogonal despread. The integrator 215 sums the output of the multiplier 213 for a symbol interval to generate a value for symbol estimation The PCB extractor'216 extracts a PCB signal from the output signal of the integrator 215 and outputs the extracted PCB signal to the PCS pattern detector 2J7, Also, the PCB extractor 216 sends the output signal of the integrator 215 to the demodulator 225<br>
Next, a more detailed description will be provided describing the operation of the PCB pattern detector 217 for detecting a PCB pattern corresponding to a particular transmit antenna.<br>
First, the antenna pattern generator 21 8 and 219 genet ate antcim patterns which conespond to the antenna patterns being generated at the base station. As described above, it is assumed that a first antenna pattern is V-I--J" and A second antenna pattern is M+l-i". Thf multiplier 220 multiplies thr outpui of the PCB extractor 216 by "+l H\ i e., the output of the first antenna pens™ generator 218 In contrast, the multiplier 22! multiplies the output of the PCB extractor 216 by<br>

"+I-1", i.e., the output of the second antenna pattern generator 219 The first and second integrators 222 and 223 integrate the output signals of the multipliers 220 and 221, respectively, and dump the integrated signals.<br>
Then, the detector 224, receiving the integrated signals, detects the true transmit antenna pattern from the output signals of the integrators 222 "nd 223 and informs the system controller (not shown) of the result.<br>
Hereinafter, me antenoa pattern detecting method will be described with reference to Table 1, assuming that the transmit antenna is the first antenna F&gt;-/, the detector 224 is aware of the punctured position of the PCB in the received siunal and therefore reads out a data value fot the punctured po.~it'/"i froir th? output signals of the integrators 222 ana 223. When the dnta value at the j#: t &gt;, ¦ T I position is equal lo the value oi'the antenna pattern multiplied by the output of the integrator 215 at the previous stage, the current input signal i? con"irtriied as the signal transmitted via the transmit antenna.
