(See Section 10 and Rule 13)<br>
COSMETIC SUNSCREEN COMPOSITE PARTICULES<br>
HINDUSTAN UNILEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under<br>
the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office<br>
at 165/166, Backbay Reclamation. Mumbai -400 020. Maharashtra, India<br>
The followirig specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br>
 <br>
SUNSCREEN COMPOSITE PARTICLES<br>
Background of the Invention Field of the Invention 5     The Invention concerns sunscreen composite particles for use in cosmetic compositions to deliver protection against ultraviolet radiation.<br>
The Related Art<br>
Ultraviolet radiation can be damaging to skin. Immediate damage may be in the form of 10      erythema. More long term is the concern of initiating cancerous growth.  For these reasons,  photoprotective agents known as sunscreens have been incorporated into cosmetic products.<br>
Organic sunscreen agents have a number of disadvantages. Under the influence of 15 ultraviolet radiation, the sunscreen agents themselves are known to degrade. Photostability may only be a matter of hours. Consumers thinking that they are fully protected with their sunscreen application, often expose themselves for a time beyond the photostability limit. Further, organic sunscreen agents can under certain circumstances cause skin irritation. A still further problem is that some sunscreen agents 20      may not be fully compatible with other sunscreen or formulation components.<br>
Attempts have been made to address the aforementioned problems. One approach has been to encapsulate the sunscreen agent. A few encapsulates are commercially available.<br>
25 A first commercial material is known as Sun Caps 664® sold by Particle Sciences Inc. of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Sun Caps 664® is formulated with a concentration of octylmethoxycinnamate (OMC) of 21.5% encapsulated in a binder that includes beeswax, carnauba wax, vinyl pyrrolidone/eicosene copolymer and emulsifiers (PEG-100 stearate, PEG-20, bis-PEG-12 dimethicone, sorbitan tristearate and Steareth-100). Sun Caps® are<br>
30 formed in a process revealed in US 5 733 531. The encapsulates are supplied as an aqueous dispersion containing up to 65% solids.<br>
 <br>
Another hydrophilic composite particulate commercially available is sold by Rona Division of EMD Chemicals under the trademark Eusolex® UV Pearls® OMC UV Pearls® CMC is prepared and described in US 7 264 795. This material is delivered as 40% particles in 60% aqueous carrier. The particles are structured with a core of greater than 70% 5 octylmethoxycinnamate surrounded by a coating of 10% silica, 1-2% polyvinylpyrrolidone (as binder) and minor ingredients.<br>
While the known encapsulates have shown some advantages, much improvement remains to be done with respect to enhanced activity and photostability. The present 10      invention has sought to address these issues.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Composite particies are provided which incfude an organic sunscreen agent dispersed within a condensation polymerized resin, the composite particles having a number 15 average particle size ranging from 10 to 2,000 nm, the condensation polymerized resin having carboxylic acid groups, and wherein the composite particles have a dielectric constant ranging from 6.5 to 18.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
20 Now it has been found that improved UV photo protection can be achieved by a cosmetic composition that incorporates composite particles of an organic sunscreen agent surrounded by a specified type of condensation polymerized resin. The condensation polymerized resin will bear carboxylic acid groups within its structure. Most important, the composite particles require a dielectric constant ranging from 6.5 to 18.<br>
25<br>
Relative weight ratio of organic sunscreen agent to condensation polymerized resin may range from 5:1 to 1:10, preferably from 1.5:1 to 1:8, more preferably from 1:1 to 1:6, optimally from 1:1 to 1:3. Amounts of the condensation polymerized resin may range from 10% to 99,5% by weight of the composite particfes. More preferably the weight of<br>
30 the condensation polymerized resin may range from 30% to 98%, optimally from 50 to 85% by weight of the composite particles. Amounts of the sunscreen agent may range from 0.5 to 90%, preferably from 2 to 70%, optimally from 30 to 50% by weight of the composite particles.<br>
 <br>
Amounts of the composite particles when placed within a cosmetic ennulsion composition may range from 0.1 to 30%, preferably from 2 to 15%, optimally from 4 to 10% by weight of the cosmetic composition.<br>
5      Number average particle size of the composite particles may range from 10 to 2,000 nm, preferably from 40 to 1,200 nm, and optimally from 50 to 1000 nm.<br>
Composite particles of the present invention are formed between an organic sunscreen agent and a condensation polymerized resin. The resin may be a polyester or polyamide. 10 Most preferably chosen is a polyamide. Ester-terminated polyamides are most useful. Two examples are polyaIkyIeneoxypolyamide (PAOPA) and ester-terminated poIy(ester-amide) (ETPEA) resins.<br>
The polyalkyleneoxypolyamide resins that may be   useful herein are outlined in<br>
<br>
15      US 6 492 458 B1 herein incorporated by reference. These PAOPA materials may be<br>
prepared by combining reactants comprising a monocarboxyfic acid compound, a<br>
diamine compound, and a dibasic acid.  Specifics of these reactants are described<br>
hereinbelow. Commercially the resins are available from the Arizona Chemical Company<br>
under the trademark Sylvadear® PA  1200V, designated  by    INCI  nomenclature as<br>

30     polyethylene       materials       sold       by       Baker-Petrolite       (Sugar       Land,       Tex.;<br>
www.bakerhughes.com/bapt/; division of Baker Hughes; www.bakerhughes,com) as their<br>
UNICID™ acids.  UNICID™ acids are fully saturated, linear carboxylic acids with average<br>
carbon chain lengths ranging from C24 to C50. Acid values for UNICID™ adds vary from 60 to 115.<br>
Still other suitable monocarboxylic acids are the alpha-branched  carboxylic  acids 5      prepared by oxidizing higher molecular weight Guerbet alcohols. Such products are available from Jarchem Industries Inc. (Newark, NJ.; wwwjarchem.com) as their JARIXCTM acids, JARIXCTM I-36 acid is a suitable monocarboxylic acid for the resins of this invention.<br>
The diamine reactant has two amine groups, both of which are preferably primary 10 amines, and is represented by the formula HN(R2a)-R2-N{R2a)H. R2a is preferably hydrogen, but may also be an alkyl group or may also join together with R2 or another R2a to form a heterocyclic structure. A preferred diamine is ethylene diamine, i.e. a diamine wherein R2a is hydrogen and R2 is -CH2CH2-.<br>
15     Diamines other than ethylene diamine may be referred to herein as co-diamines. When present co-diamines are preferably used in a minor amount compared to the ethylene diamine.<br>
Exemplary co-diamines    include     1,2-diaminopropane,     1,3-diaminopropane,     1,4-<br>
20      diaminobutane, 1,2-diamino-2-methylpropane, 1,3-diaminopentane,1,5-minopentane, 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-propanediamine, 1,6-hexanediamine (also known as<br>

phenylenediamine, diaminoaphthalene (all isomers, including 1,5; 1,8; and 2,3) and 4-<br>
amino-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine.<br>
30	Suitable aromatic co-diamines (by which is meant molecules having two reactive, preferably primary amine groups (-NH2) and at least one aromatic ring ("Ar") include xylene diamine and naphthalene diamine (all isomers).<br>
<br>
<br>
Exemplary   polyalkylene   oxide-based   co-diamines   include   without   limitation,   the JEFFAMINE™ diamines, i.e. poly(alkyIeneoxy)diamines from Huntsman Chemical (Salt Lake City, Utah), also known as polyether diamines. Preferred polyalkylene oxide-containing co-diamrnes are the JEFFAMINE® ED, XTJ and D series diamines. 5<br>
In certain embodiments the polyamide resins of the invention are prepared from co-<br>
diamine, where the co-diamine is selected from 1,6-hexanediamine, xylenediamine, 1,2-<br>
propanediamine,	2-methylpentamethylenediamine    and 1,1 2-dodecanedia mine.<br>
Suitable diamines of the present invention are available from a number of commercial 10     sources including Aldrich (Milwaukee, Wis.);   EM Industries  Inc. (Hawthorne, N.Y); Lancaster Synthesis Inc.  (Windham,  N.H) and  Spectrum  Quality Product Inc.  (New Brunswisk, N.J).<br>
The dibasic acid is an organic molecule containing two carboxylic acid groups or reactive<br>
15 equivalent thereof. A preferred dibasic acid is polymerized fatty acid, and in particular the dimer acid component of polymerized fatty acid. Polymerized fatty acid is typically a mixture of structures, including dimer acid and trimer acid, where individual dimer acids may be saturated, unsaturatred, cyclic, acyclic and combinations thereof. Polymerized fatty acid is typically formed by heating long-chain unsaturated fatty acids, e.g. C18<br>
20 monocarboxylic acids, to 200-250°C tn the presence of a clay catalyst in order that the fatty acids polymerize. The product typically comprises dimer acid, i.e. C36 dicarboxylic acid formed by dimerization of the fatty acid, and trimer acid, i.e. C54 tricarboxylic acid formed by trimerization of the fatty acid. A more detailed discussion of fatty acid polymerization may be found in U S 3 157 681.<br>
25<br>
Because fatty acid polymerization typically forms much more dimer acid than trimer acid, those skilled in the art may often refer to polymerized fatty acid as dimer acid, even though some trimer acid, and even higher polymerization products, may be present with the dimer acid. It is preferred that the polymerized fatty acid contain less than 20 weight<br>
30 percent of trimer acid, based on the total weight of the polymerized fatty acid, and that the dimer acid constitute at least 80 weight percent of the polymerized fatty acid. More preferably the dimer acid constitutes essentially all of the polymerized fatty acid.<br>
<br>
<br>
Typical unsaturated fatty acids used to form polymerized fatty acid include oleic acid, linoleic acid and linolenic acid. Tall oil fatty acid, which is a mixture containing long-chain unsaturated fatty acids obtained as a byproduct of the wood pulping process, is preferred for preparing polymerized fatty acid. 5<br>
polymerized fatty acid may be hydrogenated prior to being used in the resin-forming reaction. Hydrogenation tends to provide for a slightly higher melting point and greater oxidative and color stability.<br>
10 polymerized fatty acid, dimer acid, and hydrogenated versions thereof may be obtained from a number of commercial suppliers. For example, Arizona Chemical (Jacksonville, Fla.) sells polymerized fatty acid under their UNDYME® trademark.<br>
In addition to polymerized fatty acid, or reactive equivalents thereof, the dibasic acid may 15 comprise a co-diacid. An exemplary co-diacid is a so-called "linear" diacid of the formula HOOC-R1-COOH wherein R1 is a linear C4.17 hydrocarbon gorup, and more preferably is a linear C6-8 hydrocarbon group. Linear co-diacids suitable for the present invention include 1,6-hexanedioic acid (adipic acid), 1,7-heptanedioic acid (pimelic acid), 1-8-octanedioic acid (suberic acid), 1,9-nonanedioic acid (azelaic acid), 1,10-decanedioic acid 20 (sebacic acid), 1,11-undecanedioicacid, 1,12-dodecanedtoic acid (1,10-decanedicarboxylic acid), 1,13-tridecanedioic acid (brassylic acid) and 1,14-tetradecanedioic acid (1,12-dodecanedicarboxylic acid).<br>
Another exemplary co-diacid is the reaction product of acrylic or methacrylic acid (or the 25 ester thereof, with a subsequent hydrolysis step to form an acid) and an unsaturated fatty acid. For example, a C21 diacid of this type may be formed by reacting acrylic acid with a C18 unsaturated fatty acid (e.g., oleic acid), where an ene-reaction presumably occurs between the reactants. An exemplary C2, diacid is commercially available from Westvaco Corporation, Chemical Division, Charleston Heights, S.C. as their product 30      number 1550.<br>
Aromatic diacids may be used as the condiacid. An "aromatic diacid" as used herein is a molecule having two carboxylic acid groups (-COOH) or reactive equivalents thereof (e.g.<br>
acid chloride (-COCI) or ester (-COOR) and at least one aromatic ring ("Ar"). Phthalic acids, e.g. isophthalic acid and tereplithalic acid, are exemplary aromatic diacids.<br>
In one aspect, the resin is prepared with co-diacid and the co-diacid is selected from 1,4-5     cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid, isophthalic acid, adipic acid, azaleic acid, sebacic acid and dodecandioic acid.<br>
A second class of polyamides useful for this invention are the ester-terminated poly(ester-amide) resins. These are prepared by reacting components comprising dibasic acid, 10 diamine, polyol and monoalcohol, wherein at least 50 equivalent percent of the dibasic acid comprises polymerized fatty acid; and at least 50 equivalent percent of the diamine comprises ethylene diamine. Typical dibasic acids and diamines have already been described hereinabove.<br>
15 A further constituent of the ester-terminated poly(ester-amide) resins are the monoalcohol reactants. The monoalcohol may be represented by the formula R3-OH, wherein R3 is preferably a hydrocarbon group having at least ten carbon atoms. Thus the monoalcohol can also be described as a monohydric alcohol. In one aspect, R3 is a C10-30-hydrocarbon, preferably a C12-24 hydrocarbon, still more preferably is a C16.-22 hydrocarbon,<br>
20 and yet still more preferably is a C18 hydrocarbon. Preferably, R3 is linear, with the hydroxyl group located on a terminal carbon atoms, i.e. the monoalcohol is a primary monoalcohol. Thus 1-dodecanol, 1-tetradecanol, 1-hexadecanol (cetyl alcohol), 1-octadecanol (stearyl alcohol), 1-eicosanol (arachidyl alcohol) and 1-docosanol (behenyl alcohol) are preferred monoalcohols for preparing polyamide resins of the invention.<br>
25<br>
Another suitable monoalcohol reactant is a so-called Guerbet alcohol. Guerbet alcohols have the general formula H-C(Ra)(Rb)-CH2-0H wherein Ra and Rb may be the same or different and preferably represent a C6-12 hydrocarbon group.<br>
30 Another suitable monoalcohol reactant is a linear wax alcohol. Suitable linear wax alcohols are commercially available from, e.g. Petrolite Corporation (Tulsa, Okla.) under their UNILIN® trademark. These wax alcohols are typically a blend of linear alcohols having at least 20 carbon atoms, and more typically at least 24 carbon atoms.<br>
A final ingredient necessary in preparing an ETPEA resin of the present invention is polyol, which may also be referred to as polyhydric alcohol. The polyol is of the formula R4(OH)n wherein R4 is an n-valent organic group. For instance, R4 may be a C2-C20 organic group without hydroxyl substitution. As another example, R4 may be a hydrocarbon. Typically 5 n is selected from 2, 3,4, 5 and 6. Suitable polyols for use in preparing an ETPEA resin of the present invention include ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butylene glycol, glycerol, trimethylolpropane, pentaerythritoi, neopentyl glycol, tris(hydroxylmethyl)methanol, di-pentaerythritol and tri-pentaerthyritol.<br>
10      Preparation and description of the ETPEA resins are found in US 7 329 719 B2 herein incorporated by reference.<br>
iSunscreenligerits can either be dispersed throughout the resin or caii be formed as a core surrounded by resin.Dispersal throughout the resin is preferred. 15<br>

Example 1<br>
Atypical process to manufacture composite particles of the present invention is herein<br>
25 described. Water in the amount of 750 gm is charged to a vessel fitted with an Bcolabor™ mixer (1 liter model manufactured in Riehn, Switzerland) which has scrape surface blades (scraper). The water is then heated to 60°C. A metal beaker is charged with 125 gm Sylvaclear PA1200V® and 125 gm Parsol MCX® (2-ethylhexyl-p-methoxy cinnamate referred to as "OMC").  The beaker is placed in a water bath.  The resin<br>
30 mixture is heated up to 85-90°C and mixed until homogenous. The resin from the beaker is then added slowly to the vessel of heated water with slow mixing (20% power use on the scraper) followed by a cooling period. Upon reaching 36°C, a preservative mixture is added which includes 2.5 gm Glydant Plus®, 4 gm phenoxyethanol, 2 gm methyl<br>
<br>
paraben and 2 gm propyl paraben. The combination is then mixed and cooled. Composite particles of resin/sunscreen/preservative are then separated (via centrifuge) as particulates from the water phase. The particulates were found to have a pH of 5.4 and a dielectric constant of 8.56. 5<br>

SPF Measurements<br>
Sun protection factor (SPF) was measured in vitro using an Optometries SPF 290 instrument. The test procedure required calibration of the monochrometer and sample 5 stage of the Optometries SPF 290 instrument. Thereafter the instrument was calibrated with a blank sample quartz plate (10 cm x 10 cm and 3 mm thickness). Calibration zeros the UV detector. Formulas were applied and spread uniformly onto a plate to leave a film of 2 mg/cm2. The fifm was left to dry for 30 minutes. Subsequently an SPF reading was taken on the dried film using three measurements on different parts of the coated 10      quartz plate and recording an average value.<br>
Results of the SPF testing and the dielectric constants for each of the composite particles within the formulas is recorded in table II below.<br>

<br>
<br>
The data of table II demonstrate that as the dielectric constant of a composite increases, the SPF also increases. For instance, the composite of formula 7 evidences the lowest dielectric constant, having a value of 6. Here the SPF is only 9. By increasing the dielectric constant of the composite to 8.05 as seen in formula 5, the SPF substantially 5 increases to 14. A further increase of dielectric constant as shown in formula 4 and 6 to respectively 8.96 and 8.59 further improves the SPF to 18.<br>
Photostability is also effected by dielectric constant.    Table III provides data on UV stability of the composites.<br>

7	Sylvaclear AF 1900V® Composite 1:1 (2% internal OMC	6.00	8.8<br>
Photostability in table III is measured at an exposure time of 40 minutes. The value represents the monochromatic protection factor (MPF) initially divided by the value after 15 40 minutes. MPF is equivalent to the SPF value at a specific wavelength. For the present experiments the wavelength is the peak maximum at 320 to 310 nm. The 40 minutes time is equivalent to 10 hours of solar exposure.<br>
The data of table III reveal that photostability of a composite increases with increasing 20 dielectric constant. For instance formula 7 with a dielectric constant of 6 had a photostability of only 8.8. By contrast formulas 4 and 6 with dielectric constants of 8.59 and 8.96 had photostability values of 15 and 15.1. Intermediate was formula 5 with dielectric constant of 8,05 and a photostability of 12.3. There is a direct correlation between increased dielectric constant and improved photostability. 25<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
 <br>
Example 3<br>
A further series of experiments were conducted to evaluate how different additives placed into the composite particles can manipulate dielectric constant and thereby effect the SPF value. Table IV illustrates the additive material effects. The composite material is 5     essentially identical to formula 4 of the previous example.<br>

an additive results in a concomitant increase in SPF.<br>
