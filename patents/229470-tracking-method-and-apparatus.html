TRACKING METHOD AND APPARATUS<br>
Field of the Invention.<br>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for tracking a human<br>
or animal.<br>
Background to the Invention<br>
Radiolocation systems such as GPS are well known, but although the systems<br>
typically have good long-term accuracy, their short-tenn accuracy can be poor,<br>
particularly in a cluttered multi-path environment. The incorporation of inertial sensors<br>
has been applied to improve the performance of radiolocation systems used for<br>
navigation of aircraft, ships, submarines, and more recently, vehicles such as cars and<br>
trucks. Accelerometer data can be integrated to acquire velocity data, and a second<br>
integration results in displacement Similarly, the integration of rate-gyro data results in<br>
angular or heading data. With three-axis sensors, motion in three dimensions can be<br>
tracked. One important characteristic of such position data is the good short-term<br>
accuracy, although small errors in the s ensor data mean the long-term accuracy is poor.<br>
Thus, by combining the radiolocation and sensor data, which have complementary<br>
performance, the overall accuracy is improved.<br>
The present invention concerns the tracking of people or animals. There are a<br>
number of applications, both indoor and outdoor for such a tracking system. The<br>
preferred application of the proposed method is indoors where the radiolocation<br>
performance is poor or non-existent; for example GPS does not function inside<br>
buildings. Potential applications include the office environment, hospital/nursing<br>
homes, high security environments where traceability of people is crucial, and fire<br>
righting in buildings. Outdoor applications in which the invention may be<br>
advantageously employed are situations where wide-area navigation systems, such as<br>
GPS, are not available. A potential area of applications in sports. Applications in the<br>
sports area are varied and include tracking of racehorses on a track or athletes on a track<br>
or a sports field. A variant of the sports application is in the training activities<br>
associated with these sports, where the main aim is to obtain biomedical data associated<br>
with fitness, m this case, the positional data could be combined with medical sensor<br>
data to provide additional information not currently available from existing technology.<br>
In all of these applications, the position data can be used to generate animated displays<br><br>
WO 2004/077374	PCT/AU2004/000239<br>

based on the data.<br>
However, there are a number of problems associated with tracking people or<br>
animals which are not present in relation to other systems designed to track aircraft,<br>
ships, or cars. Firstly, there are problems with indoor environments in which such a<br>
system might be used, in that radiolocation is made inaccurate by errors caused by<br>
multiple signal paths.<br>
Also, any inertial sensors included in a mobile unit, such as a mobile<br>
telephone, must be very small, as the unit must be small and lightweight to enable it to<br>
be easily carried by a person or animal. The small size of the sensors restricts their<br>
performance, and therefore their accuracy will be much worse than sensors used in<br>
traditional inertial navigation systems.  Because of the poor accuracy of the sensors,<br>
integration time is restricted to comparatively short periods, say a maximum of 10<br>
seconds for a positional accuracy of a few metres.<br>
Furthermore, the unit cannot be firmly attached to the body, so that the<br>
orientation of the sensors is not accurately known. Indeed, the orientation can vary with<br>
each use of the system, so that the system must be recalibrated on each use. The device<br>
may be carried in different ways by different people, for instance, men typically wear<br>
the device on a belt or in a coat pocket, whereas women typically carry the device in a<br>
bag. Sensors used typically have poor stability in the bias offset, so that some form of<br>
real time compensation if necessary if the integrated sensor output are to be of any<br>
practical use. Furthermore, the motion of the human body is much more complex than<br>
rigid bodies such as aircraft, so that the sensor outputs are typically dominated by the<br>
accelerations and rotations associated with activities such as walking, rather than<br>
accelerations associated with changing positions.<br>
In summary, because of the differences in the sensors and the operating<br>
environment, the application of traditional methods for the integration of inertial and<br>
sensor data is inappropriate for tracking humans or animals.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
According to the present invention, a method of tracking a human or animal<br>
comprises:<br>
providing a mobile unit to be carried by the human or animal, the mobile unit<br><br>
WO 2004/077374	PCT/AU2004/000239<br>
-   3   -<br>
including at least one inertial sensor and a radio transmitter for transmitting data from<br>
the mobile unit to a base station;<br>
using the output data of the inertial sensor to count the number of steps taken<br>
by the human or animal; and<br>
predicting the position of the human or animal based on the number of steps<br>
taken and step length data for the human or animal.<br>
In this method, the number of steps taken by the human or animal can be<br>
determined from the data of the inertial sensor, such as an accelerometer or rate-gyro.<br>
If the human or animal is following a known path, such as an athlete or a racehorse on a<br>
track, orientation data are not necessarily required to predict the position of the human<br>
or animal. However, the mobile unit preferably includes a sensor for detecting the<br>
direction of movement. Two magnetometers can be used to measure the earth's<br>
magnetic field in two orthogonal directions, and by combining these data an estimate of<br>
the heading angle can be determined. Additionally, a rate-gyro may be used to detect<br>
rotations of the person or animal. As indoors the earth's magnetic field can suffer from<br>
magnetic anomalies, these two types of sensors can advantageously be used in<br>
combination to increase the accuracy of the heading angle determination. In particular,<br>
the rate-gyro data can preferably be used to filter out anomalies in the magnetometer<br>
data.<br>
Because the long-term accuracy of the method employing inertial sensors alone<br>
can be poor, preferably the method includes periodically correcting the position data by<br>
comparison to a reference point (checkpoint). This function may be achieved by<br>
periodically monitoring the position by a radiolocation system such as GPS.<br>
Alternatively or additionally, a map-matching technique may be used, wherein the<br>
predicted position is located on a map, such as a map of a building, and corrected<br>
accordingly. The map matching requires the identification of particular checking points<br>
on the map of the building which may be based on distinctive behaviour of a person or<br>
animal. This distinctive behaviour may be detectable by the inertial sensors. Examples<br>
of distinctive behaviour could include 90 degrees turns (very common in buildings), and<br>
walking up/down stairs (which has a pattern distinctive form walking). When such an<br>
event is detected, the dead-reckoning position is compared with the checkpoint's<br>
position, and if the error is sufficiently small (say 5 metres), the position of the mobile<br>
is corrected to that of the checkpoint A.further possibility may be to periodically check<br>
the position by reference to a further system, for instance, in a building, a security<br>
system whereby a key or card is required to pass through doors.<br><br>
WO 2004/077374	PCT/AU2004/000239<br>
-4-<br>
To obtain a reasonably accurate displacement estimate from the counting of<br>
steps, the average stride length must be known. The stride length of the user could be<br>
measured and entered as a parameter, but preferably the system automatically<br>
determines this parameter. The average stride length can be determined if the number<br>
of footsteps between two known positions is measured. The known positions can be<br>
based on an accurate radiolocation and/or by the map-matching technique. Preferably,<br>
this stride length parameter is regularly updated.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the system is applied to sports training, and the<br>
mobile unit additionally includes at least one bio-sensor for obtaining biomedical data<br>
associated with fitness. Examples include a heart rate monitor or a breathing rate<br>
monitor. The position and inertial sensor data can be combined to derive parameters<br>
such as stride length and rate, speed, lap times, and this can be matched with the<br>
biosensor data such as heart rate and breathing rate. In effect, the positional/inertial<br>
data are the "input", and the biosensors measure the "output". Combining these two<br>
sets of data provides good information regarding physical fitness. The system allows<br>
real-time interaction between a coach and an athlete, so that performance tasks can be<br>
adapted as required by the coach based on real-time observation of performance. A<br>
radio can also be used for bio-feedback to the athlete, and audio prompts can be used to<br>
guide the athlete in a given task.<br>
The method may include generating an animated display indicating the<br>
position of the human or animal on a map. The map may be of a building or sports<br>
track or field.<br>

Detailed Description of the Examples<br>
The preferred embodiment relates to indoor position location, and particularly<br>
position location inside a building. The basis of the indoor operation using the inertial<br>
data is to estimate the track by counting the number of steps and by measuring the<br>
direction of travel using the compass (as corrected by the rate-gyro data). The number<br>
of steps can be determined from the accelerometer data. Figure 1 shows an example of<br>
the accelerometer data on the x-axis 1, the y-axis 2, and the z-axis 3, for a person<br>
walking, and it can clearly be seen that each individual step can be detected on all three<br>
axes, although the steps are more clearly evident on the z axis accelerometer. Further,<br>
the data also can be used to detect when the person is stationary, so that both movement<br>
and stationary states can be deduced.<br>
As shown in Figure 2, the second type of sensor data that is used is the<br>
compass or heading angle. Two magnetometers are used to measure the earth* s<br>
magnetic field in two orthogonal directions, and by combining these data an estimate of<br>
the heading angle is determined. The magnetometer data 4 are shown in Figure 2, and it<br>
can be seen that there are anomalies in the magnetometer data 4. This behaviour is<br>
because, indoors the earth's magnetic field can suffer from magnetic anomalies, which<br>
typically result in local variations in the computed heading angle when moving around a<br>
building. These short-term variations can be minimised by the application of a<br>
complementary filter, which utilises the short-term stability of the rate-gyro and the<br>
long-term stability of the compass to obtain better accuracy in the heading data. Figure<br>
2 shows the filtered data 5, in which the anomalies have been largely removed.<br>
By combining the displacement inferred from counting the number of steps<br>
and the heading data, an estimate of the position as a function of time can be<br>
determined. Note that these positional data are relative to the initial starting point, but if<br>
this point is known (using radiolocation or some other technique), then the positions can<br>
be determined absolutely. This technique is referred to as "dead-reckoning".<br>
To obtain a reasonably accurate displacement estimate from the counting of<br>
footsteps, the average stride length must be known. While the stride length of<br>
individuals (user of the mobile unit) could be independently measured and entered as a<br>
parameter, a better approach is for the system to automatically determine this parameter.<br>
The average stride length can be determined if the number of footsteps between two<br>
known positions is measured. The known positions can be based on an accurate<br>
radiolocation, or by the map matching technique described further below. Thus the<br><br>
WO 2004/077374	PCT/AU2004/000239<br>
-   6   -<br>
"ture" displacement and the number of footsteps can be combined to determine the<br>
average stride length. This stride length estimate can then be used for further dead-<br>
reckoning until another known point is reached. The accuracy of the position fix is<br>
related to the variation in the stride length and the heading accuracy. If, for example, the<br>
average stride length of 1 metre has an accuracy of 5 percent, a typical stride rate of one<br>
per second results in a positional error of ±3 metres after one minute of walking. If the<br>
dead reckoning is corrected every minute, then the positional error can be capped to ±3<br>
metres for all time. This indoor accuracy compares favourably with (say) GPS outdoors.<br>
Figure 3 shows an example of the raw integrated 6 from the data shown in the<br>
accelerometer and compass data of Figures 1 and 2, and the actual path 7. The circles<br>
are the individual footsteps.<br>
An important element of the indoor position location system is the regular<br>
updating of the dead-reckoning position at "known" positions or checkpoints. One<br>
approach is to use radiolocation; for example when the person is close to a Base Station<br>
the position can be determined to within a few metres using either timing range data<br>
and/or signal strength data, The range can be determined by measuring the elapsed<br>
delay for around-trip from the Base Station to the mobile and back to the Base Station-<br>
By accounting for the delay in the equipment, the two-way propagation delay can be<br>
converted to a range using the know speed of propagation of radio waves.<br>
This is illustrated in Figure 4, which shows the range to the mobile unit from<br>
the Base Station for the example given previously. The track passes close (2 metres) to<br>
the Base Station at a time of about 8 seconds, so that the position is known to within 2<br>
metres at this time. Thus the position can be updated using the Base Station location as<br>
the checkpoint. The noise in the measured range limits the accuracy indoors to a few<br>
metres. If the range to two such Base Stations is measured, the position can be<br>
determined. However, the accuracy depends on the range, and decreases as the range<br>
increases. Typical accuracy at 40 metres range inside a office building is of the order of<br>
10 metres.<br>
However, for a practical implementation the number of Base Stations will be<br>
limited. A more accurate method of position determination is "map matching". From a<br>
map of a building the checkpoints are extracted for the map matching task. The<br>
checkpoints may include 90 and 180 degree turns, stairs, restrictions points such as<br>
doorways, building entry at security points requiring a card or other security device, and<br>
common positions of rest (such as a desk in an office, or a chair or bed in a home).<br><br>
WO 2004/077374	PCT/AU2004/000239<br>
-   7   -<br>
Some checkpoints could additionally be associated with measuring the range to a Base<br>
Station. If a map of the building is used in conjunction with the dead-reckoning,<br>
positions can be inferred from the map and the motion of the mobile/person. For<br>
example, if the position is known initially, this position can be located on the building<br>
map. As the person walks through the building, the position can be plotted on the map.<br>
However, the position cannot be arbitrary, as the path must not (for example) go<br>
through wall. At certain points, the path will pass through restriction point such as a<br>
doorway. Provided the dead-reckoning position at this time is accurate to (say) ±3<br>
metres, the doorway can be located without error on the map, and thus the position at<br>
that point in time is accurately known. This procedure can be used to regularly correct<br>
the position, thus preventing the errors from increasing over time without limit.<br>
The location system can be further enhanced as the system measures activity<br>
and direction as well as position. For example, the posture of the person can be<br>
determined from the accelerometer data, so that the difference between standing still,<br>
walking, sitting and lying down can be determined. These activities can be further used<br>
to assess the position of theperson. For example, if the person is seated in a direction<br>
associated with working on a computer in a known room, then it can be reasonably<br>
assumed that the person is in fact at the location of the computer/desk/chair. This<br>
technique can be used to match activities/locations for a particular person, thus<br>
providing a profile of the activities of the person, as well as the position/track of the<br>
person. This type of system can be used for a variety of applications, including<br>
monitoring of people in hazardous locations, or (say) elderly people in their home. Any<br>
unusual activity could be used to sound an alarm. Statistical data on activity is also a<br>
useful measure of heath, so that medical applications for the technology can be<br>
envisioned.<br>
The preferred embodiment of the proposed system relates to indoor position<br>
location applications, where the resources of radiolocation, sensor data and other<br>
relevant information can be combined to obtain positional data. However, the method<br>
can be extended to outdoor applications, and in particular the integration of the<br>
radiolocation and sensor data can be performed using the traditional techniques. For<br>
example, a GPS unit could provide the radiolocation data outside (and corrected using<br>
the sensor data), while an alternative radiolocation system would be used indoors. Thus<br>
the combined system could provide seamless operation both outdoors and indoors.<br>
