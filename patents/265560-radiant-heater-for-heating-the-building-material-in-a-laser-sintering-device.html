RADIANT HEATING FOR THE HEATING OF A BUILDING MATERIAL IN A<br>
LASER SINTERING DEVICE<br>
The present invention is related to a radiant heating accord-<br>
ing to the preamble of claim 1 and to a laser sintering appa-<br>
ratus having such a radiant heating.<br>
Such a radiant heating and such a laser sintering device for<br>
the manufacturing of a three-dimensional object are known from<br>
WO 92/08566.<br>
A resistive heating element made of graphite in order to pro-<br>
cess semiconductor wafers at temperatures up to 1200°C is<br>
known from US 2004/0074898 Al. The thickness of the resistive<br>
element in such a case is 0.1 inch (2.54 mm) or more. Due to<br>
the high thickness of the resistive heating element its ther-<br>
mal inertia is high. In particular at lower temperatures no<br>
fast temperature control or adjustment is possible with it.<br>
When manufacturing a three-dimensional object by subsequently<br>
solidifying layers of a powder material by a laser beam the<br>
temperature of the material has to be within a certain process<br>
window in order to ensure a good quality of the three-<br>
dimensional object. For a fast and exact adjustment/control of<br>
this temperature the dynamic behavior of the radiant heating<br>
is decisive.<br>
Therefor-e, the object of providing a radiant heating for a la-<br>
ser sintering device and providing a laser sintering device<br>
having such a radiant heating, by which the temperature of the<br><br>
2<br>
material can be adjusted/controlled in a fast and exact way,<br>
forms the basis of the invention.<br>
The object is achieved by a radiant heating according to claim<br>
1 and by a laser sintering device for manufacturing of a<br>
three-dimensional object according to claim 14. Further devel-<br>
opments of the invention are described in the sub-claims.<br>
Compared to the use of conventional radiant heaters such as<br>
lamps or heating rods the use of a panel radiator in a laser<br>
sintering device has the advantage that it can be operated at<br>
the same radiated power at lower temperatures. This leads to<br>
less lateral radiation to the walls of the process chamber and<br>
to a cooler atmosphere in the process chamber.<br>
The inventive radiant heating has the particular advantage<br>
that it has a heat radiating element having a lower thermal<br>
inertia. Therefore, the power emitted by the heat radiating<br>
element can be quickly changed. This allows for a fast and ex-<br>
act adjustment/control of the temperature of the material that<br>
is heated by the radiant heating.<br>
Moreover, due to the invention the manufacturing of a three-<br>
dimensional object of a high quality at a short building time<br>
is possible.<br>
The use of graphite for the inventive heat radiating element<br>
has the advantage that graphite has a high heat conductivity<br>
and at the same time has a low specific heat capacitance. This<br>
corresponds to a high thermal diffusivity a, which can be cal-<br>
culated from the specific thermal conductivity λ, the specific<br>
density p and the specific heat capacity c according to the<br>
following equation:<br><br>
3<br>
a = λ/(p-c) .<br>
A high thermal diffusivity is accompanied by a low thermal in-<br>
ertia and a homogeneous temperature distribution or radiant<br>
power of the heat radiating element. Further, graphite has the<br>
advantage that it can be used at high temperatures.<br>
Further features and the usefulness of the invention will<br>
arise from the description of embodiments on the basis of the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of an example of the laser<br>
sintering device;<br>
Fig. 2 shows a radiant heating according to a first embodi-<br>
ment ;<br>
Fig. 3 shows a modification of the radiant heating from Fig.<br>
2;<br>
Fig. 4 shows a radiant heating according to a second embodi-<br>
ment ; and<br>
Fig. 5 shows a radiant heating according to a third embodi-<br>
ment .<br>
Fig. 1 shows a laser sintering device having the inventive ra-<br>
diant heating. The laser sintering device comprises a con-<br>
tainer 1, which is open to the top. A support 2 for supporting<br>
the object 3 to be formed is provided in the container 1. The<br>
support 2 can be moved up and down in the container 1 in a<br>
vertical direction A by means of a drive 4. The upper edge of<br>
the container 1 defines a work plane 5. An irradiation device<br>
6, which is a laser, is positioned above the work plane 5 and<br><br>
4<br>
emits a directed laser beam that is deflected onto the work<br>
plane 5 by a deflection device 7. Moreover, an application de-<br>
vice 8 is provided for applying a layer of a powder material<br>
to be solidified onto the surface of the support 2 or a previ-<br>
ously solidified layer. The application device can be moved<br>
back and forth across the work plane 5 by means of a drive<br>
that is schematically indicated by the arrows B. The applica-<br>
tion device 8 is fed from two powder reservoirs 10 by means of<br>
two dosing devices 9 at the left and at the right of the con-<br>
struction field. Furthermore, two spill-over containers 11 are<br>
provided at the left and at the right of the construction<br>
field, which can take up the excess powder that accumulates<br>
during the powder application.<br>
Furthermore the device comprises a radiant heating 12, which<br>
is located above the work plane 5, for pre-heating an applied<br>
powder layer, which has not yet been sintered, up to a work<br>
temperature TAsuitable for sintering. The radiant heating 12<br>
is constructed such that the applied powder layer may be<br>
heated uniformly.<br>
Above the work plane 5 a temperature measuring device 13 is<br>
provided at a distance, which serves for a non-contact measur-<br>
ing of the temperature of the previously applied or uppermost<br>
powder layer.<br>
The work area is secluded from the surrounding by a process<br>
chamber 16. Thereby the oxidation of the powder and the re-<br>
lease of possible process gases can be prevented, if neces-<br>
sary.<br>
A control and/or adjustment device 17 serves for controlling<br>
and/or adjusting the power of the radiant heating 12 as well<br>
as the power of the irradiation device 6. For that purpose the<br><br>
5<br>
control and/or adjustment device 17 is connected to the radi-<br>
ant heating 12, the temperature measuring device 13 and to the<br>
irradiation device 6.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a first embodiment of the radiant heating.<br>
The radiant heating 112 according to the first embodiment com-<br>
prises a resistive element 113 as heat radiating element. The<br>
resistive element 113 is formed of a graphite plate (e.g. car-<br>
bon fiber reinforced graphite plate ®SigraBond of SGL Carbon)<br>
having a thermal diffusivity a &gt; 1.5.10-4 m2/s at a temperature<br>
of 20°C and a thickness of d = 2.0 mm. It substantially has<br>
the shape of a rectangle with a rectangular opening 114 for<br>
the laser beam and the optical path of the temperature measur-<br>
ing device being positioned at the center. The resistive ele-<br>
ment surrounding the rectangular opening is interrrupted at<br>
the periphery by means of a gap 115. On both sides of the gap<br>
a contact 116 and 116' , respectively, which in each case is<br>
designed as a copper bar, is attached to the resistive ele-<br>
ment. A controllable voltage supply 117 that is designed for<br>
high currents (approximately 20-40 A at a voltage of 30-60 V)<br>
is connected to the contacts 116, 116'. Slits 118 are extend-<br>
ing from the corners of the opening 115 towards the corners of<br>
the outer periphery of the resistive element in order to<br>
achieve a more homogeneous distribution of the current density<br>
and an increase of the heating power in the area of the outer<br>
corners, respectively, as soon as a voltage is applied to the<br>
contacts 116, 116' in the resistive element.<br>
In the following the operation of the previously described la-<br>
ser sintering device and the inventive radiant heating will be<br>
described.<br><br>
6<br>
At first, a first powder layer is applied onto the support 2<br>
by means of the application device 8.<br>
It is particularly important for the quality of the finished<br>
object that the temperature of the uppermost powder layer to<br>
be solidified is a temperature within a predetermined range<br>
that is the process window. Above of this process window the<br>
powder is already sintered without additional radiation en-<br>
ergy, while at temperatures below the process window warping<br>
may occur in the solidified layer. Often the so-called curl<br>
effect, wherein the edges of the solidified layer bend up or<br>
roll up, is also attributed to a too low temperature of the<br>
uppermost powder layer. Therefore, in order to achieve good<br>
results, in particular to prevent warpage in the manufactured<br>
object, before the solidification the powder layer applied by<br>
the application device must be heated by the radiant heating<br>
12 up to a work temperature TA within the process window.<br>
For this purpose after the application of the powder layer the<br>
temperature of this layer is measured without contact by the<br>
temperature measuring device 13. Depending on the temperature<br>
measured thereby the heating power of the radiant heating 12<br>
is determined. After the uppermost powder layer has been<br>
heated up to the work temperature TA, the positions in the pow-<br>
der layer corresponding to the cross-section of the object are<br>
solidified by irradiation with the laser.<br>
After the solidification of a layer the support 2 is lowered<br>
by a distance corresponding to the layer thickness and a new<br>
powder layer is applied onto the previously irradiated layer<br>
by means of the application device 8. Then the previously de-<br>
scribed steps are repeated until the manufacturing of the<br>
three-dimensional object is completed.<br><br>
7<br>
In Fig. 3 a modification of the first embodiment is shown. A<br>
heat radiating element 113' according to this modification<br>
differs from the heat radiating element shown in Fig. 2 in<br>
that it comprises meander-shaped area paths, by which the<br>
value of ohmic resistance - and thereby the heating power for<br>
a certain voltage applied to the resistive element - can be<br>
increased.<br>
In Fig. 4 a cross-section of a second embodiment of the inven-<br>
tive radiant heating is shown.<br>
In the radiant heating 212 according to the second embodiment<br>
a graphite foil 213 (e.g. ®Sigraflex graphite foil from SGL<br>
Carbon) is provided as heat radiating element, which has a<br>
thermal diffusivity of a = 2.14.10-4 m2/s at a temperature of<br>
20°C in a direction parallel to the foil and which has a<br>
thickness of d = 0.5 mm.<br>
In order to achieve a high emission coefficient the graphite<br>
foil 213 is treated with a blackbody spray. It is pressed<br>
against a heating wire 215 by means of thin rigid profiled<br>
bars 214, so that a good thermal contact is formed between the<br>
heating wire 215 and the graphite foil 213. Moreover, the pro-<br>
filed bars contribute to the mechanical stability of the<br>
graphite foil.<br>
At the side of the heating wire 215 facing away from the<br>
graphite foil a first insulation 216 is provided, which has a<br>
bottom side that is reflective for heat radiation. A material<br>
having high mechanical stability is selected as material for<br>
the first insulation. Preferably this first insulation 216 is<br>
made of graphite rigid felt (e.g. ®SigraTherm Graphite Rigid<br>
Felt of SGL Carbon) having a low heat conductivity (the ther-<br><br>
8<br>
mal conductivity λ. of ®SigraTherm Graphite Rigid Felt is lower<br>
than 0.3 W/mK at temperatures below 1000°C).<br>
At the side of the first insulation 216 facing away from the<br>
heating wire 215 a second insulation 217 is provided. This<br>
second insulation need not have mechanical stability, however,<br>
must have good heat insulating characteristics. Preferably the<br>
second insulation is made of a material having a heat conduc-<br>
tivity λ = 0.03 W/mK or less at temperatures below 400°C (e.g.<br>
OPromalight of Proma).<br>
At the side facing away from the graphite foil and at the lat-<br>
eral sides of the first and second insulations are surrounded<br>
by a stainless steel frame 218 at which also the profiled bars<br>
214 are mounted. Also, in order to achieve mechanical stabili-<br>
sation, spacers 218 of an insulating material are provided<br>
laterally between the graphite foil and the first insulation<br>
216.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a third embodiment of the inventive radiant heat-<br>
ing.<br>
As it was the case in the second embodiment, in the radiant<br>
heating 312 according to the third embodiment a graphite foil<br>
313 is provided as heat radiating element. However, differing<br>
from the second embodiment, this graphite foil is not heated<br>
by a heating wire, but by IR heat radiators 314, which are po-<br>
sitioned at a distance on one side of the graphite foil. Lat-<br>
erally and at the side facing away from the graphite foil the<br>
IR heat radiators 314 are surrounded by an insulating shell<br>
315 with a distance inbetween. The insulating shell is charac-<br>
terized in that it is reflective for heat radiation towards<br>
the side of the IR radiators and that it has preferably low<br>
heat conductivity. Like the heat insulation consisting of the<br><br>
9<br>
first and second insulation in the second embodiment, the in-<br>
sulating shell 315 may have a multi-layer construction in or-<br>
der to combine a mechanical stability with good insulating<br>
characteristics at the same time.<br>
Alternatives and modifications of the above-described laser<br>
sintering device, radiant heating and the above-described<br>
method are possible.<br>
The inventive radiant heating was described to comprise a heat<br>
radiating element having a shape with a rectangular outline.<br>
This geometry of the heat radiating element is particularly<br>
suited for a uniform heating of a rectangular target field.<br>
However, the shape of the heat radiating element is not lim-<br>
ited to this, but may have any arbitrary two-dimensional shape<br>
that is adapted to the corresponding geometrical proportions.<br>
Thus, e.g. the heat radiating element may be formed having a<br>
circular outline. Accordingly also the rectangular opening may<br>
have a different shape such as a round shape.<br>
It is also possible to provide a plurality of heating zones.<br>
Thus, in the radiant heating according to the first embodiment<br>
a plurality of resistive heating elements may be provided, in<br>
the radiant heating according to the second embodiment a plu-<br>
rality of heating wires may be provided and in the radiant<br>
heating according to the third embodiment a plurality of IR<br>
heat radiators may be provided, which in each case can be op-<br>
erated independently of each other in order to form a plural-<br>
ity of heating zones that are independent from one another.<br>
In the first embodiment a graphite plate has been described as<br>
material of the heat radiating element. The use of a different<br>
material is possible as long as the thermal diffusivity has a<br>
value above approximately a = 1.5.10-4 m2/s at a temperature of<br><br>
10<br>
20°C. In particular, it is also possible to use a graphite<br>
foil as heat radiating element like in the second embodiment.<br>
If necessary, elements providing mechanical stabilisation have<br>
to be provided in case the heat radiating element is not self-<br>
supporting. It is e.g. possible to clamp or apply the graphite<br>
file onto a grid.<br>
The second embodiment has been described to comprise a heat<br>
radiating element being pressed to a heating wire. However,<br>
the heating wire can also run within the heat radiation ele-<br>
ment and in particular within a groove in the heat radiation<br>
element. In addition, the heating wire may be sandwiched bet-<br>
ween two graphite elements by pressing.<br>
In the second and third embodiment the use of a graphite foil<br>
as heat radiating element has been described. However, the use<br>
of another material having a thermal diffusivity above ap-<br>
proximately a = 1.5.10-4 m2/s, preferably above a = 2.10-4 m2/s<br>
at 20°C, is also possible. In particular, also a graphite<br>
plate can be used.<br>
The different embodiments of the radiant heating have been de-<br>
scribed having heat radiating elements of a certain thickness.<br>
A different thickness, in particular a smaller thickness, is<br>
possible. With respect to the thermal characteristics a pref-<br>
erably small thickness is desirable. A lower boundary for the<br>
thickness is the mechanical stability.<br><br>
