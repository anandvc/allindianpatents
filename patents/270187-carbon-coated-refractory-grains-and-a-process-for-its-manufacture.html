				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to carbon coated refractory grains and to a process for<br>
developing such grains for the purpose of making refractory bricks or castables using such<br>
coated grains. Carbon black used for the coating purpose is a nano material having particle<br>
size of 24-36nm which is preferably about 99.9 % pure carbon and is amorphous in<br>
nature. Advantageously, such coated carbon is provided such that it is insoluble in water<br>
and form film over the grains. Also, the carbon coated on the surface of the grain forming<br>
a thin film over it is adapted such as not to come out even in alkaline water and thus<br>
favouring making carbon containing bricks/castables durable and avoids problems of<br>
carbon being exposed during pressing or casting. The carbon coated grains are also<br>
adapted to be used as nozzle filling compound of steel ladles. The carbon nano particle<br>
based thin film coated refractory grains according to the present invention thus have wide<br>
application in various industrial applications, for making refractory bricks and/or castables,<br>
particularly for use in steel industries.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
It is known in the art of manufacturing refractory bricks or castables that use of carbon<br>
coated refractory oxide grains is quite common. Conventionally, refractory grains are<br>
coated with graphite that is used in making carbon containing bricks or castables. Graphite<br>
is a flaky material that could not coat the grains properly. As a result, the flaky graphite<br>
comes to the surface of the brick at the time of pressing the grains to form brick. The main<br>
obstacle in developing carbon containing castable resides in the use of graphite which is<br>
non wettable in water and comes to the surface at the time of casting and thus making the<br>
bricks or castables less durable and unable to provide desired thermal conductivity or like<br>
properties.<br>
Attempts have been made to try out different types of oils and organic<br>
compounds/solvents to coat different: types of refractory oxide grains with carbon black.<br>
But none of the conventional process could result in the desired characteristics of the<br>
coated grains suitable for use in refractory bricks or castables.<br><br>
There has been thus a continuing need to developing carbon coating on refractory grains,<br>
by obtaining an appropriate solvent that would provide a stable solution dissolving the<br>
carbon black nano particles of selective size which would on one hand form coating on the<br>
refractory oxide grains of a number of varieties in common use and on the other hand<br>
form a stable thin film which would not be removed during formation of the bricks by<br>
pressing or preparing castables.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is thus the basic object of the present invention to provide for carbon coated refractory<br>
grains which would on one hand form coating on the refractory oxide grains of a number<br>
of varieties in common use and on the other hand form a stable thin film which would not<br>
be removed during subsequent treatments/uses of such in variety of refractory materials.<br>
Another objcet of the invention is direcetd to the development of a process of producing<br>
such desired carbon coated refractory grains that would be insoluble in water and also<br>
favourably form the desired film over the refractory grains.<br>
A further object of the present invention is directed to possible obtaining of bricks or<br>
castables from the carbon nano particle coated refractory oxide grains which would provide<br>
stable coating and do not get damaged during pressing or casting operation.<br>
A further object of the present invention is directed to the carbon coated refractory grain<br>
adapted to form bricks or castables which when subjected to alkaline solution the carbon<br>
would not come out of the grain and thus provide for a durable and effective coating of<br>
the grains.<br>
A still further object of the present invention is directed to developing the carbon nano<br>
particle coated refractory grain used to form bricks or castables wherein said coated grains<br>
are adapted to restrict the hydration of grains.<br><br>
A still further object of the present invention directed to the carbon nano particle coated<br>
refractory grains such that the coated grains are also useful as nozzle filling compound of<br>
steel ladles.<br>

The present invention and its advantages and objects are described in further details with<br>
reference to the following non limiting illustrative examples:<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVETION WITH REFERENCE TO FOLLOWING<br>
ACCOMPANYING EXAMPLE<br>
As already described , the present: invention is directed to developing carbon coated<br>
refractory grains and a process for developing such grains for the purpose of making<br>
carbon containing refractory bricks or castables using such coated grains. Such coated<br>
carbons are insoluble in water and form film over the grains providing a stable coating<br>
which do not get damaged or removed during pressing/casting operation for<br>
manufacturing of bricks or castables.<br>
The process of developing the carbon coated refractory oxide grains of a number of types<br>
to suit different application were developed following a number of experiments to arrive at<br>
the optimum result. The process involving the various input materials such as selective<br>
carbon particles, different solvents and different alternative refractory oxide grains and the<br>
various selective steps to develop the carbon coated refractory grains for use in making<br><br>
bricks and castables of desired characteristics are illustrated through the folllowing<br>
examples:<br>
EXAMPLE: 1<br>
Different natural oils like mustard oil, Karanj oil, Custard oil and Kerosene oil have been<br>
mixed separately with different percentage of carbon black ranging from 0.25%wt to 2.0<br>
% wt having particle size in the range of 0.5mm to 5mm, to coat the grains of quartz,<br>
alumina, sintered and fused magnesia. The observed results are as given below:<br>
Mustard oil made a solution with carbon black but could not coat the grain well.<br>
Karanj oil and custard oil made a solution better than mustard oil and coat the<br>
grain but the coating did not stick on the grain and came out easily.<br>
Kerosene oil could not make a solution with carbon black.<br>
Also the organic compounds of different varieties have been used to coat the grain with<br>
carbon black namely Formaldehyde, Ethylene glycol, Ethyl alcohol.<br>
Formaldehyde, Ethylene glycol made a solution well with carbon black but could<br>
not coat the grains which could stick on the grains.<br>
Ethyl alcohol could not make a solution with carbon black.<br>
EXAMPLE-2<br>
To obtain a stable coat of carbon solution on refractory grains of a number of types of<br>
oxide materials which are used for manufacturing carbon containing bricks or castables,<br>
following process steps in accordance with the present invention were followed :<br>
1. The carbon particles used for the purpose of coating on grains are taken to be Carbon<br>
black which is a nano material, amorphous in nature and is 99.9% pure carbon. The<br>
particle size of black carbon is in the range of 24-36nm.<br>
2. Organic solvent Furancarbinol used to form a solution with carbon black and coat the<br>
grain well.<br><br>
3. Nano carbon material carbon black coated the oxide grains well with organic hydrophilic<br>
compound Furancarbinol.<br>
4. The grains of different type like quartz, alumina, sintered and fused magnesia were<br>
coated with different ratio of crabon black and Furancarbinol such as,<br>
Solvent Furancarbinol to carbon black in the ratio of:<br>
Type of Grains Preferred range of ratios<br>
Quarzite: 0.25% to 2.0% by wt.<br>
Fused Alumina: 0.25% to 2.0% by wt.<br>
Sintered and<br>
fused magnesite: 0.25% to 1.0% by wt.<br>
5. With the carbon solution obtained as above , the carbon solution was coated on the<br>
surface of the grains to form a film over the grains.<br>
6. The coated grain thus produced were dried in the temperature range of 80°C to 120cC<br>
for a period of 0.5 hr to 2 hr and preferably 110°C for a period of about 1 Hr.<br>
7. Resulting grains obtained from the process was found to have a stable coating on<br>
drying, which is glazy in appearance and is not easily removed by rubbing or do not come<br>
out even when rubbed with hands or is subjected to alkal solution.<br>
8. The carbon coated refractory oxide grains thus produced were next used for making<br>
carbon containing bricks by pressing or producing castables by casting, which demonstrate<br>
the desired thermal or electrical characteristics of the coated refractory particles for<br>
respective end uses.<br>
In particular, the properties of the carbon-coated grains were found to have the following<br>
properties favourable for producing carbon containing bricks or castables:<br>
The carbon coated the surface properly and forms a film over the grain;<br>
When rubbing it in hand carbon is not coming out from the grain that confirms<br>
carbon coated the grain well;<br>
The coated grain is glazy in appearance;<br><br>
The coated grain when put in alkali solution carbon is not comes out of the grain;<br>
The coated grain when put in water no carbon is coming out from the grain which<br>
is good for development of carbon containing castables;<br>
- The coated grain are capable of restricting the hydration of grain;<br>
The coated grains are thermally and electric conductive.<br>
It is thus possible by way of this invention to produce carbon coated refractory grains and<br>
in particular, carbon black nano particle in organic Furancarbinol based solution, providing<br>
a stable coating of carbon on different variety of refractory oxide grains such as the fused<br>
alumina, quartzite, sintered and fused magnesia and the like, whereby the grains are<br>
rendered suitable for use for producing the bricks by pressing or the castables by casting<br>
process, without any damage to the carbon coating and maintaining desired thermal and<br>
electrical properties for longer term with a stable performance in a number of application<br>
of such carbon coated refractory particles including such as refractory bricks or castables<br>
in steel industries.<br><br>
