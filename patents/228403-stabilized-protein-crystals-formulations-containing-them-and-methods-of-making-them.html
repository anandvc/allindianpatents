				<td>STABILIZED PROTEIN CRYSTALS,<br>
FORMULATIONS CONTAINING THEM AND METHODS OF MAKING THEM<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to methods for the<br>
stabilization, storage and delivery of biologically<br>
active macromolecules, such as proteins, peptides and<br>
nucleic acids. In particular, this invention relates<br>
to protein or nucleic acid crystals, formulations and<br>
compositions comprising them. Methods are provided for<br>
the crystallization of proteins and nucleic acids and<br>
for the preparation of stabilized protein or nucleic<br>
acid crystals for use in dry or slurry formulations.<br>
The crystals, crystal formulations and compositions of<br>
this invention can be reconstituted with a diluent for<br>
the parenteral administration of biologically active<br>
macromolecular components.<br>
The methods of this invention are useful for<br>
preparing crystals of "naked" DNA and RNA sequences<br>
that code for therapeutic or immunogenic proteins and<br>
can be administered parenterally. The dissolving DNA<br>
and RNA molecules, subsequently taken up by the cells<br>
and used to express the protein with the proper<br>
glycosylation pattern, can be either therapeutic or<br>
immunogenic. Alternatively, the present invention is<br>
useful for preparing crystals, crystal formulations and<br><br>
compositions of sense and antisense polynucleotides of<br>
RNA or DNA.<br>
The present invention is further directed to<br>
encapsulating proteins, glycoproteins, enzymes,<br>
antibodies, hormones and peptide crystals or crystal<br>
formulations into compositions for biological delivery<br>
to humans and animals. According to this invention,<br>
protein crystals or crystal formulations are<br>
encapsulated within a matrix comprising a polymeric<br>
carrier to form a composition. The formulations and<br>
compositions enhance preservation of the native<br>
biologically active tertiary structure of the proteins<br>
and create a reservoir which can slowly release active<br>
protein where and when it is needed. Such polymeric<br>
carriers include biocompatible and biodegradable<br>
polymers. The biologically active protein is<br>
subsequently released in a controlled manner over a<br>
period of time, as determined by the particular<br>
encapsulation technique, polymer formulation, crystal<br>
geometry, crystal solubility, crystal crosslinking and<br>
formulation conditions used. Methods are provided for<br>
crystallizing proteins, preparing stabilized<br>
formulations using pharmaceutical ingredients or<br>
excipients and optionally encapsulating them in a<br>
polymeric carrier to produce compositions and using<br>
such protein crystal formulations and compositions for<br>
biomedical applications, including delivery of<br>
therapeutic proteins and vaccines. Additional uses for<br>
the protein crystal formulations and compositions of<br>
this invention involve protein delivery in human food,<br>
agricultural feeds, veterinary compositions,<br>
diagnostics, cosmetics and personal care compositions.<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Proteins are used in a wide range of<br>
applications in the fields of pharmaceuticals,<br>
veterinary products, cosmetics and other consumer<br>
products, foods, feeds, diagnostics, industrial<br>
chemistry and decontamination. At times, such uses<br>
have been limited by constraints inherent in proteins<br>
themselves or imposed by the environment or media in<br>
which they are used. Such constraints may result in<br>
poor stability of the proteins, variability of<br>
performance or high cost.<br>
It is imperative that the higher order three-<br>
dimensional architecture or tertiary structure of a<br>
protein be preserved until such time that the<br>
individual protein molecules are required to perform<br>
their unique function. To date, a limiting factor for<br>
use of proteins, particularly in therapeutic regimens,<br>
remains the sensitivity of protein structure to<br>
chemical and physical denaturation encountered during<br>
delivery.<br>
Various approaches have been employed to<br>
overcome these barriers. However, these approaches<br>
often incur either loss of protein activity or the<br>
additional expense of protein stabilizing carriers or<br>
formulations.<br>
One approach to overcoming barriers to the<br>
widespread use of proteins is crosslinked enzyme<br>
crystal ("CLEC™") technology [N.L. St. Clair and M.A.<br>
Navia, J. Am. Chem. Soc, 114, pp. 4314-16 (1992)].<br>
See also PCT patent application PCT/US91/05415.<br>
Crosslinked enzyme crystals retain their activity in<br>
environments that are normally incompatible with enzyme<br>
function. Such environments include prolonged exposure<br><br>
to proteases, organic solvents, high temperature or<br>
extremes of pH. In such environments, crosslinked<br>
enzyme crystals remain insoluble, stable and active.<br>
Despite recent progress in protein technology<br>
generally, two problems which are discussed below<br>
continue to limit the use of biological macromolecules<br>
in industry and medicine. The first problem relates to<br>
molecular stability and sensitivity of higher order<br>
tertiary structures to chemical and physical<br>
denaturation during manufacturing and storage. Second,<br>
the field of biological delivery of therapeutic<br>
proteins requires that vehicles be provided which<br>
release native proteins, such as proteins,<br>
glycoproteins, enzymes, antibodies, hormones, nucleic<br>
acids and peptides at a rate that is consistant with<br>
the needs of the particular patient or the disease<br>
process.<br>
Macromolecule Stability<br>
Numerous factors differentiate biological<br>
macromolecules from conventional chemical entities,<br>
such as for example, their size, conformation and<br>
amphiphilic nature. Macromolecules are not only<br>
susceptible to chemical, but also physical degradation.<br>
They are sensitive to a variety of environmental<br>
factors, such as. temperature, oxidizing agents, pH,<br>
freezing, shaking and shear stress [Cholewinski, M.,<br>
Luckel, B. and Horn, H., Acta Helv., 71, 405 (1996)].<br>
In considering a macromolecule for drug development,<br>
stability factors must be considered when choosing a<br>
production process.<br>
Maintenance of biological activity during the<br>
development and manufacture of pharmaceutical products<br>
depends on the inherent stability of the macromolecule,<br><br>
as well as the stabilization techniques employed. A<br>
range of protein stabilization techniques exist;<br>
including:<br>
a)	Addition of chemical "stabilizers" to<br>
the aqueous solution or suspension of protein. For<br>
example, United States patent 4,297,344 discloses<br>
stabilization of coagulation factors II and VIII,<br>
antithrombin III and plasminogen against heat by adding<br>
 selected amino acids. United States patent 4,783,441<br>
discloses a method for stabilizing proteins by adding<br>
surface-active substances. United States patent<br>
4,812,557 discloses a method for stabilizing<br>
interleukin-2 using human serum albumin. The drawback<br>
of such methods is that each formulation is specific to<br>
the protein of interest and requires significant<br>
development efforts.<br>
b)	Freeze/thaw methods in which the<br>
preparation is mixed with a cryoprotectant and stored<br>
at very low temperatures. However, not all proteins<br>
will survive a freeze/thaw cycle.<br>
c)	Cold storage with cryoprotectant<br>
additive, normally glycerol.<br>
d)	Storage in the glass form, as described<br>
in United States patent 5,098,893. In this case,<br>
proteins are dissolved in water-soluble or water-<br>
swellable substances which are in amorphous or glassy<br>
state.<br>
e)	The most widely used method for the<br>
stabilization of proteins is freeze-drying or<br>
lyophilization [Carpenter, J.F., Pical, M.J., Chang,<br>
B.S. and Randolph, T.W., Pharm. Res., 14:(8) 969<br>
(1997)]. Whenever sufficient protein stability cannot<br>
be achieved in aqueous solution, lyophilization<br>
provides the most viable alternative. One<br><br>
disadvantage of lyophilization is that it requires<br>
sophisticated processing, is time consuming and<br>
expensive [Carpenter, J.F., Pical, M.J., Chang, B.S.<br>
and Randolph, T.W., Pharm. Res., 14:(8) 969 (1997} and<br>
literature cited therein]. In addition, if<br>
lyophilization is not carried out carefully, most<br>
preparations are at least partially denatured by the<br>
freezing aid dehydration steps of the technique. The<br>
result is frequently irreversible aggregation of a<br>
portion of:protein molecules, rendering a formulation<br>
unacceptable for parenteral administration.<br>
The vast majority of protein formulations<br>
produced by the above-described techniques require cold<br>
storage, sometimes as low as -20°C. Exposure to<br>
elevated temperatures during shipping or storage can<br>
result in significant activity losses. Thus, storage<br>
at elevated, or even ambient temper-atures, is not<br>
possible for many proteins.<br>
Proteins, peptides and nucleic acids are<br>
increasingly employed in the pharmaceutical,<br>
diagnostic food, cosmetic, detergent and research<br>
industries; There is a great need for alternative<br>
stabilization procedures, which are fast/ inexpensive<br>
and applicable to a broad range of biological<br>
macromolecules. In particular, stetbilization<br>
procedures: are needed that do not rely on the excessive<br>
use of excipients, which can interfere with the<br>
functions of those biological macromolecules.<br>
The stability of small molecule crystalline<br>
drugs is such that they can with stand extreme forces<br>
during the; formulation process (see United States<br>
patent 5,510,118). Forces associated with milling<br>
nanoparticles of crystalline material of relatively<br>
insoluble drugs include: shear stress, turbulent flow,<br>
high impact collisions, cavitation and grinding. Small<br><br>
molecular crystalline compounds have been recognised as<br>
being much more stable toward chemical degradation than<br>
the corresponding amorphous solid [Pical, M.J., Lukes,<br>
A.L., Lang, J.E. and Gaines, J. Pherm. Sci., 67, 767<br>
(1978) ] . Unfortunately, crystals of macromolecules,<br>
such as proteins and nucleic acids, present additional<br>
problems and difficulties not associated with small<br>
molecules.<br>
for most of this century, science and<br>
medicine have tried to solve the problem of providing<br>
insulin in a useful form to diabetics. Attempts have<br>
been made to solve some of the problems of stability<br>
and biological delivery of that protein. For example,<br>
United States patent 5,506,203 describes the use of<br>
amorphous insulin combined with an absorbtion enhancer.<br>
The solid state insulin was exclusively amorphous<br>
material, as shown by a polarized light microscope.<br>
Jensen et al. co-precipitated insulin with an<br>
absorbtion enhancer for use in respiratory tract<br>
delivery of insulin (See PCT patent application WO<br>
98/42368) , • Here, tne absorbtion enhancer was desribed<br>
as a surfactant, such as a salt of a fatty acid or a<br>
bile salt. Insulin crystals of lets than 10<br>
micrometers in diameter and lacking zinc were produced<br>
by S. Hayelund (See PCT patent application WO<br>
98/42749) . Similarly, crystals were also produced in<br>
the presence of surfactants to enhance pulmonary<br>
admlnistration.<br>
CA-A-1 196 864 relates to compositions<br>
comprising crystals of insulin and a biodegradable<br>
matrix of a biodegradable polymer. The biodegradable<br>
polymer is further defined as any convenient<br>
biodegradable polymer which is soluble in organic<br>
solvents to permit the formation of a matrix therewith.<br><br>
to date, those of skill in the art recognize<br>
that the greatly enhanced stability of the crystalline<br>
t<br>
state observed for small molecules does not translate<br>
to biological macromolecules [Pica], M.J. and Rigsbee,<br>
D.R., Pharm. Res., 14:1379 (1997)]. For example,<br>
aqueous suspensions of crystalline insulin are only<br>
slightly more stable (to the degree of a factor of two)<br>
than corresponding suspensions of amorphous phase<br>
[Brange, J,, Langkjaer, L., Havelund, S. and Volund,<br>
A., Pharm.:Res., 9:715 (1932)]. In the solid state,<br>
lyophiliped amorphous insulin is far mort stable than<br>
lyophilized crystalline insulin under all conditions<br>
investigated [Pical, M.J. and Rigsbee, P.R., Pharm.<br>
Res., 14;1379 (1997)].<br>
Molecular weight has profound effect on all<br>
properties of macromolecules, including their<br>
macromolecular volume, hydration/ viscosity, diffusion,<br>
mobility and stability. [Cantor, C.R and Schimmel, P.R,<br>
Biophysical Chemistry, W.H. Freemar. and Co., New York:,<br>
1980].<br>
WO 96/18417 relates to pharmaceutical<br>
compositions comprising a crystalline protein and<br>
polyethylene glycol or a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
vegetable oil. The invention is described by the<br>
authors as unexpectedly high controlled release<br>
properties that result when crystalline proteins are<br>
suspended in a PEG solution or gel, or in a vegetable<br>
oil. The authors specifically claim compositions<br>
comprising crystalline proteins selected from the group<br>
consisting of crystalline erythropcietin (EPO),<br>
crystalline granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-<br>
CSF), crystalline insulin, and crystalline granulocyte-<br>
macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF),<br>
WO-A-9 641 873 relates to formulations of<br>
polynucleotide complexes which are stabilized with a<br><br>
cryoprotect compound and lyophilized. The lyophilized<br>
formulations are then milled or sieved into a dry<br>
powder formulation which may be used to deliver the<br>
polynucleotide complex.<br>
	SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
We have found, surprisingly, that biological<br>
macromolecules which are not stable when held in<br>
solution at ambient or elevated temperatures can<br>
nevertheless be successfully stored in dry form for<br>
long periods of rime at such temperatures in<br>
crysralline form. As a practical matter, five aspects<br>
of this discovery are particularly advantageous.<br>
First, crystallinity of stored materials is<br>
very important, since large scale crystallization can<br>
i be introduced as a final purification step and/or<br>
concentration step in clinical manufacturing processes,<br>
such as those for manufacturing therapeutics and<br>
vaccines. Moreover, large scale crystallization can<br>
replace some of the purification steps in the<br><br>
manufacturing process. For example, protein<br>
crystallization can streamline the production of<br>
protein formulations making it more affordable.<br>
Second, macromolecular interactions which<br>
occur in solution are prevented or severely reduced in<br>
the crystalline state, due to considerable reduction of<br>
all reaction rates. Thus, the crystalline state is<br>
uniquely suited to the storage of mixtures of<br>
biological macromolecules.<br>
Third, solid crystalline preparations can be<br>
easily reconstituted to generate ready to use<br>
parenteral formulations having very high protein<br>
concentration. Such protein concentrations are<br>
considered to be particularly useful where the<br>
formulation is intended for subcutaneous<br>
administration. (See PCT patent application WO<br>
97/04801). For subcutaneous administration, injection<br>
volumes of 1.5 ml or less are well tolerated. Thus,<br>
for proteins that are dosed at 1 mg/kg on a weekly<br>
basis a protein concentration of at least 50 mg/ml is<br>
required and 100-200 mg/ml is preferred. These<br>
concentrations are difficult to achieve in liquid<br>
formulations, due to the aggregation problems. They<br>
can easily be achieved in the crystalline formulations<br>
of this invention.<br>
Fourth, protein crystals also constitute a<br>
particularly advantageous form for pharmaceutical<br>
dosage preparation. The crystals may be used as a<br>
basis for slow release formulations in vivo. As those<br>
of skill in the art will appreciate, particle size is<br>
of importance for the dissolution of crystals and<br>
release of activity. It is also known that the rate of<br>
release is more predictable if the crystals have<br>
substantially uniform particle size and do not contain<br><br>
amorphous precipitate (see European patent 0 265 214).<br>
Thus, protein crystals may be advantageously used (see<br>
PCT patent application WO 96/40049), on implantable<br>
devices. Implant reservoirs are generally on the order<br>
of 25-250 μl. With this volume restriction, a<br>
formulation of high concentration (greater than 10%)<br>
and a minimum amount of suspension vehicle is<br>
preferred. Protein crystals of this invention may be<br>
easily formulated in non-aqueous suspensions in such<br>
high concentrations.<br>
Fifth, another advantage of crystals is that<br>
certain variables can be manipulated to modulate the<br>
release of macromolecules over time. For example,<br>
crystal size, shape, formulation with excipients that<br>
effect dissolution, crosslinking, level of crosslinking<br>
and encapsulation into a polymer matrix can all be<br>
manipulated to produce delivery vehicles for biological<br>
molecules.<br>
The present invention overcomes the above-<br>
described obstacles by employing the most stable form<br>
of an active protein, the crystalline form and either<br>
(1) adding ingredients or excipients where necessary to<br>
stabilize dried crystals or (2) encapsulating the<br>
protein crystals or crystal formulations within a<br>
polymeric carrier to produce a composition that<br>
contains each crystal and subsequently allows the<br>
release of active protein molecules. Any form of<br>
protein, including glycoproteins, antibodies, enzymes,<br>
hormones or peptides, may be crystallized and<br>
stabilized or encapsulated into compositions according<br>
to the methods of this invention. In addition, the<br>
nucleic acids coding for such proteins may be similarly<br>
treated.<br><br>
The crystal(s) may be encapsulated using a<br>
variety of polymeric carriers having unique properties<br>
suitable for delivery to different and specific<br>
environments or for effecting specific functions. The<br>
rate of dissolution of the compositions and, therefore,<br>
delivery of the active protein can be modulated by<br>
varying crystal size, polymer composition, polymer<br>
crosslinking, crystal crosslinking, polymer thickness,<br>
polymer hydrophobicity, polymer crystallinity or<br>
polymer solubility.<br>
The addition of ingredients or excipients to<br>
the crystals of the present invention or the<br>
encapsulation of protein crystals or crystal<br>
formulations results in further stabilization of the<br>
protein constituent.<br>

may be more fully understood, the following detailed<br>
description is set forth. In the description, the<br>

form of protein, sometimes referred to as amorphous<br>
precipitate, which has no molecular lattice structure<br>
characteristic of the crystalline solid state.<br>

gene whose expression is intended to be inhibited.<br><br>
Aqueous-organic solvent mixture — a mixture<br>
comprising n% organic solvent, where n is between 1 and<br>
99 and m% aqueous, where m is 100-n.<br>
Biocompatible polymers — polymers that are<br>
non-antigenic (when not used as an adjuvant), non-<br>
carcinogenic, non-toxic and which are not otherwise<br>
inherently incompatible with living organisms.<br>
Examples include: poly (acrylic acid), poly<br>
(cyanoacrylates) , poly (amino acids), poly<br>

of the protein crystal formulation may have a spherical<br>
morphology and be microspheres of up to 500 micro<br>

Crvstallinitv<br>
Crystallinity of macromolecules is of great<br>
value for their storage and delivery in vivo. However,<br>
few techniques exist for the preparation of large<br>
quantities of such crystalline macromolecules which are<br>
stable outside of the mother liquor. Crystals of<br>
proteins and nucleic acids must be handled with<br>
considerable care, since they are extremely fragile and<br>
contain a high proportion of solvent. It is well known<br>
in x-ray crystallography that the diffraction patterns<br>
from macromolecular crystals quickly degenerate upon<br>
dehydration in air. Normally, a crystal is carefully<br>
separated from its mother liquor and inserted into a<br>
capillary tube. The tube is sealed from the air using<br>
dental wax or silicone grease, along with a small<br>
amount of mother liquor inside to maintain hydration<br>
[McPherson, A., Preparation and Analysis of Protein<br>
Crystals, Robert E. Krieger Publishing, Malabar, p. 214<br>
(1989)]. Another technique is to collect data from<br>
macromolecular crystals at cryogenic temperatures. The<br>
crystals are prepared and then rapidly cooled to<br>
prevent ice lattice formation in the aqueous medium.<br>
Instead of ice, a rigid glass forms, encasing the<br><br>
crystal with little damage. Crystals are then<br>
maintained at 100 °K to prevent crystal disintegrations<br>
[Rodgers, D.W., in Methods in Enzvmoloay (Eds., Carter,<br>
C.W. and Sweet, R.M.) Academic Press, v.276, p. 183<br>
(1997)]. While this technique allows one to maintain<br>
crystals outside of their mother liquor, it cannot be<br>
used at temperatures higher than 100 °K.<br>
In principle, dried crystals can be prepared<br>
by lyophilization. However, this technique involves<br>
rapid cooling of the material and can be applied only<br>
to freeze stable products. The aqueous solution is<br>
first frozen to between -40 and -50°C. Then, the ice<br>
is removed under vacuum. Ice formation is usually<br>
destructive to the protein crystal lattice, yielding a<br>
mixture of crystals and amorphous precipitate.<br>
It is desirable to produce macromolecules, in<br>
the crystalline state, that are pure and stable under<br>
storage conditions at ambient temperatures. Such<br>
crystals constitute a particularly advantageous form of<br>
proteins or nucleic acids for dosage preparations of<br>
therapeutics and vaccines. The present invention<br>
provides formulations and compositions for storage of<br>
crystalline macromolecules as either solid particles or<br>
dispersed in a non-aqueous solvent. Furthermore, the<br>
invention may be applied to the storage of a single<br>
biological macromolecule or a mixture of macromolecules<br>
that do not interact with each other.<br>
In another embodiment, this invention<br>
provides a method for rendering biological<br>
macromolecules suitable for storage in suspensions<br>
comprising replacing the mother liquor with a non-<br>
aqueous solvent. In yet another embodiment, the<br>
crystalline slurry can be rendered solid by spinning<br>
out the first solvent and washing the remaining<br><br>
crystalline solid using a second organic solvent to<br>
remove water, followed by evaporation of the non-<br>
aqueous solvent.<br>
Non-aqueous slurries of crystalline<br>
therapeutic proteins are especially useful for<br>
subcutaneous delivery, while solid formulations are<br>
ideally suited for pulmonary administration. Pulmonary<br>
delivery is particularly useful for biological<br>
macromolecules which are difficult to deliver by other<br>
routes of administration. (See, for example, PCT<br>
patent applications WO 96/32152, WO 95/24183 and WO<br>
97/41833) .<br>
The proteins referred to below include<br>
protein crystals themselves, or nucleic acid crystals<br>
comprising DNA or RNA which encode those proteins upon<br>
cellular uptake.<br>
This invention advantageously provides<br>
compositions and formulations of crystals of proteins<br>
or nucleic acids.<br>
Stability of Encapsulated Crystals<br>
Those of skill in the art will appreciate<br>
that protein stability is one of the most important<br>
obstacles to successful formulation of polymer<br>
microparticulate delivery systems that control the<br>
release of proteins. The stability of proteins<br>
encapsulated in polymeric carriers may be challenged at<br>
three separate stages: manufacture of the protein<br>
crystal composition, protein release from the resulting<br>
composition and in vivo stability after the protein<br>
release. During preparation of microparticles or<br>
microspheres containing soluble or amorphous proteins,<br>
the use of organic solvents and lyophilization are<br>
especially detrimental to protein stability.<br><br>
Subsequently, released proteins are susceptible to<br>
moisture-induced aggregation, thus resulting in<br>
permanent inactivation.<br>
In order to achieve high protein stability<br>
during preparation of protein formulations and<br>
compositions according to the present invention, it is<br>
necessary to restrict the mobility of individual<br>
protein molecules — a result best achieved in the<br>
crystalline solid state. For the purpose of this<br>
application, solid state may be divided into two<br>
categories: amorphous and crystalline. The three-<br>
dimensional long-range order that normally exists in a<br>
crystalline material does not exist in the amorphous<br>
state. Furthermore, the position of molecules relative<br>
to one another is more random in the amorphous or<br>
liquid states, relative to the highly ordered<br>
crystalline state. Thus, amorphous proteins may be<br>
less stable than their crystalline counterparts.<br>
Figure 1 depicts the relative stability of<br>
the following molecular states of Candida rugosa lipase<br>
("CRL"): crosslinked amorphous, liquid, crystalline in<br>
20% organic solvent, crosslinked crystalline in 20%<br>
organic solvent, crosslinked crystalline without<br>
organic solvent. Figure 1 shows that crystalline CRL<br>
retains 80% activity for more than 175 hours in 20%<br>
organic solvent. In contrast, both amorphous and<br>
soluble forms of the enzyme are completely inactivated<br>
within hours. The present invention advantageously<br>
utilizes the crystalline forms of proteins because of<br>
their superior stability characteristics.<br>
Maintaining Crvstallinitv<br>
In order to use protein crystals as the<br>
protein source for preparing protein formulations and<br>
compositions according to the present invention, the<br><br>
problem of protein crystal dissolution outside the<br>
crystallization solution ("mother liquor") had to be<br>
overcome. In order to maintain protein crystallinity<br>
and hence stability, in the production of the protein<br>
crystal formulations and compositions of this<br>
invention, several approaches may be used:<br>
1.	Crystals remain in the mother liquor in the course<br>
of producing protein crystals encapsulated with<br>
polymeric carriers. Many compounds used in<br>
protein crystallization, such as salts, PEG and<br>
organic solvents, are compatible with polymer<br>
processing conditions.<br>
2.	Kinetics of dissolution. The rate of crystal<br>
dissolution outside the mother liquor depends on<br>
conditions, such as pH, temperature, presence of<br>
metal ions, such as Zn, Cu and Ca and<br>
concentration of precipitants. By varying these<br>
conditions, one can slow down the dissolution of<br>
crystals for several hours. At the same time, the<br>
process of microparticulate formation is very fast<br>
and normally takes seconds to minutes to complete.<br>
3.	Dried protein crystals. The mother liquor can be<br>
removed by filtration and the remaining<br>
crystalline paste can be dried by air, under<br>
vacuum, by washing with water miscible organic<br>
solvents and/or by lyophilization.<br>
4.	Protein crystals can be chemically crosslinked to<br>
form non-dissolvable or slowly dissolvable<br>
crystals.<br><br>
5. The crystal size and shape can be manipulated and<br>
controlled in the course of crystallization.<br>
Thus, a range of crystal morphologies, each having<br>
different dissolution kinetics and subsequently<br>
different sustained release profiles compared to<br>
amorphous proteins, is available.<br>

Administration and Biological Delivery<br>
To date, therapeutic proteins have generally<br>
been administered by frequent injection, due to their<br>
characteristic negligible oral bioavailability and<br>
short plasma life. The protein crystal formulations<br>
and compositions of the present invention, which<br><br>
include microparticulate-based sustained release<br>
systems for protein drugs, advantageously permit<br>
improved patient compliance and convenience, more<br>
stable blood levels and potential dose reduction. The<br>
slow and constant release capabilities of the present<br>
invention advantageously permit reduced dosages, due to<br>
more efficient delivery of active protein. Significant<br>
cost savings may be achieved by using the protein<br>
formulations and compositions described herein.<br>
Formulations and compositions comprising<br>
protein crystals in polymeric delivery carriers<br>
according to this invention may also comprise any<br>
conventional carrier or adjuvant used in vaccines,<br>
pharmaceuticals, personal care formulations and<br>
compositions, veterinary formulations, or oral enzyme<br>
supplementation. These carriers and adjuvants include,<br>
for example, Freund's adjuvant, ion exchangers,<br>
alumina, aluminum stearate, lecithin, buffer<br>
substances, such as phosphates, glycine, sorbic acid,<br>
potassium sorbate, partial glyceride mixtures of<br>
saturated vegetable fatty acids, water, salts or<br>
electrolytes, such as protamine sulfate, disodium<br>
hydrogen phosphate, sodium chloride, zinc salts,<br>
colloidal silica, magnesium, trisilicate, cellulose-<br>
based substances and polyethylene glycol. Adjuvants<br>
for topical or gel base forms may include, for example,<br>
sodium carboxymethylcellulose, polyacrylates,<br>
polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene-block polymers,<br>
polyethylene glycol and wood wax alcohols.<br>
According to one embodiment of this<br>
invention, protein crystals may be combined with any<br>
conventional materials used for controlled release<br>
administration, including pharmaceutical controlled<br>
release administration. Such materials include, for<br><br>
example, coatings, shells and films, such as enteric<br>
coatings and polymer coatings and films.<br>

this invention, which may be devices, such as<br>
implantable devices and may be microparticulate protein<br>
delivery systems.<br>
In one embodiment of this invention, the<br>
macromolecule crystals have a longest dimension between<br>
about 0.01 μm and about 500 μm, alternatively between<br>
about 0.1 μm. and about 100 μm. The most preferred<br>
embodiment is that the protein crystal of protein<br>
crystal formulation components are between about 50 μm.<br>
and about 100. μm in their longest dimension. Such<br>
crystals may have a shape selected from the group<br>
consisting of: spheres, needles, rods, plates, such as<br>
hexagons and squares, rhomboids, cubes, bipyramids and<br>
prisms.<br>
According to the present invention,<br>
encapsulation of protein crystals or protein crystal<br>
formulations in polymeric carriers to make compositions<br>
may be carried out on protein crystals which are<br>
crosslinked or uncrosslinked. Such protein crystals<br>
may be obtained commercially or produced as illustrated<br>
herein.<br>

invention may be used as ingredients in personal care<br>
compositions, including cosmetics, such as creams,<br>
lotions, emulsions, foams, washes, compacts, gels,<br>
mousses, slurries, powders, sprays, pastes, ointments,<br>
salves, balms, drops, shampoos and sunscreens. In<br>
topical creams and lotions, for example, they may be<br>
used as humectants or for skin protection, softening,<br><br>
bleaching, cleaning, deproteinization, lipid removal,<br>
moisturizing, decoloration, coloration or<br>
detoxification. They may also be used as anti-oxidants<br>
in cosmetics.<br>
According to this invention, any individual, <br>
including humans, animals and plants, may be treated in <br>
a pharmaceutically acceptable manner with a<br>
pharmaceutically effective amount of protein or nucleic<br>
acid crystals or a crystal formulation or composition<br>
for a period of time sufficient to treat a condition in<br>
the individual to whom they are administered over some<br>
period of time. Alternatively, individuals may receive<br>
a prophylactically effective amount of protein or<br>
nucleic acid crystals or crystal formulation or<br>
composition of this invention which is effective to<br>
prevent a condition in the individual to whom they are<br>
administered over some period of time.<br>
Protein or nucleic acid crystals or crystal<br>
formulations or compositions may be administered alone,<br>
as part of a pharmaceutical, personal care or<br>
veterinary preparation, or as part of a prophylactic<br>
preparation, such as a vaccine, with or without<br>
adjuvant. They may be administered by parenteral or<br>
oral routes. For example, they may be administered by<br>
oral, pulmonary, nasal, aural, anal, dermal, ocular,<br>
intravenous, intramuscular, intraarterial,<br>
intraperitoneal, mucosal, sublingual, subcutaneous, or<br>
intracranial route. In either pharmaceutical, personal<br>
care or veterinary applications, protein or nucleic<br>
acid crystal or crystal formulations or compositions<br>
may be topically administered to any epithelial<br>
surface. Such epithelial surfaces include oral,<br>
ocular, aural, anal and nasal surfaces, which may be<br>
treated, protected, repaired or detoxified by<br><br>
application of protein or nucleic acid crystals or<br>
crystal formulations or compositions.<br>
Pharmaceutical, personal care, veterinary or<br>
prophylactic formulations and compositions comprising<br>
protein or nucleic acid crystal or crystal formulations<br>
or compositions according to this invention may also be<br>
selected from the group consisting of tablets,<br>
liposomes, granules, spheres, microparticles,<br>
microspheres and capsules.<br>
For such uses, as well as other uses<br>
according to this invention, protein or nucleic acid<br>
crystals or crystal formulations and compositions may<br>
be formulated into tablets. Such tablets constitute a<br>
liquid-free, dust-free form for storage of protein or<br>
nucleic acid crystal or crystal formulations or<br>
compositions which are easily handled and retain<br>
acceptable levels of activity or potency.<br>
Alternatively, protein or nucleic acid<br>
crystals or crystal formulations or compositions may be<br>
in a variety of conventional depot forms employed for<br>
administration to provide reactive compositions. These<br>
include, for example, solid, semi-solid and liquid<br>
dosage forms, such as liquid solutions or suspensions,<br>
slurries, gels, creams, balms, emulsions, lotions,<br>
powders, sprays, foams, pastes, ointments, salves,<br>
balms and drops.<br>
Protein or nucleic acid crystals on<br>
formulations or compositions according to this<br>
invention may also comprise any conventional carrier or<br>
adjuvant used in pharmaceuticals, personal care<br>
compositions or veterinary formulations. These<br>
carriers and adjuvants include, for example, Freund's<br>
adjuvant, ion exchangers, alumina, aluminum stearate,<br>
lecithin, buffer substances, such as phosphates,<br><br>
glycine, sorbic acid, potassium sorbate, partial<br>
glyceride mixtures of saturated vegetable fatty acids,<br>
water, salts or electrolytes, such as protamine<br>
sulfate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, sodium chloride,<br>
zinc salts, colloidal silica, magnesium, trisilicate,<br>
cellulose-based substances and polyethylene glycol.<br>
Adjuvants for topical or gel base forms may include,<br>
for example, sodium carboxymethylcellulose,<br>
polyacrylates, polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene-block<br>
polymers, polyethylene glycol and wood wax alcohols.<br>
The most effective mode of administration and<br>
dosage regimen of the protein or nucleic acid crystals<br>
or crystal formulations or compositions of this<br>
invention will depend on the effect desired, previous<br>
therapy, if any, the individual's health status or<br>
status of the condition itself and response to the<br>
protein or nucleic acid crystals or crystal<br>
formulations or compositions and the judgment of the<br>
treating physician or clinician. The protein or<br>
nucleic acid crystals or crystal formulations or<br>
compositions may be administered in any dosage form<br>
acceptable for pharmaceuticals, vaccinations, gene<br>
therapy, immunotherapy, personal care compositions or<br>
veterinary formulations, at one time or over a series<br>
of treatments.<br>
The amount of the protein or nucleic acid<br>
crystals or crystal formulations or compositions which<br>
provides a single dosage will vary depending upon the<br>
particular mode of administration, formulation, dose<br>
level or dose frequency. A typical preparation will<br>
contain between about 0.01% and about 99%, preferably<br>
between about 1% and about 50%, protein or nucleic acid<br>
crystals (w/w). Alternatively, a preparation will<br>
contain between about 0.01% and about 80% protein<br><br>
crystals, preferably between about lv&gt; and about 50%,,<br>
protein crystals (w/w). Alternatively, a preparation<br>
will contain between about 0.01% and about 80% protein<br>
crystal formulation, preferably between about l'i, and<br>
about 50%, protein crystal formulation (w/w) .<br>
Upon improvement of the individual's<br>
condition, a maintenance dose of protein or nucleic<br>
acid crystals or crystal formulations or compositions<br>
may be administered, if necessary. Subsequently, the<br>
dosage or frequency of administration, or both, may be<br>
reduced as a function of the symptoms, to a level at<br>
which the improved condition is retained. When the<br>
condition has been alleviated to the desired level,<br>
treatment should cease. Individuals may, however,<br>
require intermittent treatment on a long-term basis<br>
upon any recurrence of the condition or symptoms<br>
thereof.<br>
Production of crystals, crystal formulations<br>
and compositions:<br>
According to the one embodiment of this<br>
invention, crystals, crystal formulations and<br>
compositions are prepared by the following process:<br>
First, the protein or nucleic acid is crystallized.<br>
Next, excipients or ingredients selected from sugars,<br>
sugar alcohols, viscosity increasing agents, wetting or<br>
solubilizing agents, buffer salts, emulsifying agents,<br>
antimicrobial agents, antioxidants, and coating agents<br>
are added directly to the mother liquor.<br>
Alternatively, the crystals are suspended in an<br>
excipient solution, after the mother liquor is removed,<br>
for a minimum of 1 hour to a maximum of 24 hours. The<br>
excipient concentration is typically between about 0.01<br>
to 30% W/W. Most preferably between about 0.1 to 10%.<br>
The ingredient concentration is between about 0.01 to<br><br>
90%. The crystal concentration is between about 0.01<br>
to 95%. The mother liquor is then removed from the<br>
crystal slurry either by filtration or by<br>
centrifugation. Subsequently, the crystals are washed<br>
optionally with solutions of 50 to 100% one or more<br>
organic solvents such as, for example, ethanol,<br>
methanol, isopropanol or ethyl acetate, either at room<br>
temperature or at temperatures between -20 °C to 25 °C.<br>
The crystals are the dried either by passing a stream<br>
of nitrogen, air, or inert gas over the crystals.<br>
Alternatively, the crystals are dried by air drying or<br>
by lyophilization or by vacuum drying. The drying is<br>
carried out for a minimum 1 hour to a maximum of 72<br>
hours after washing, until the moisture content of the<br>
final product is below 10% by weight, most preferably<br>
below 5%. Finally, micronizing of the crystals can be<br>
performed if necessary.<br>
According to one embodiment of this<br>
invention, when preparing protein crystals, protein<br>
crystal formulations or compositions, enhancers, such<br>
as surfactants are not added during crystallization.<br>
Excipients or ingredients are added to the mother<br>
liquor after crystallization, at a concentration of<br>
between about 1-10% W/W, alternatively at a<br>
concentration of between about 0.1-25% W/W,<br>
alternatively at a concentration of between about 0.1-<br>
50% W/W. The excipient or ingredient is incubated with<br>
the crystals in the mother liquor for about 0.1-3 hrs,<br>
alternatively the incubation is carried out for 0.1-12<br>
hrs, alternatively the incubation is carried out for<br>
0.1-24 hrs.<br>
In another embodiment of this invention, the<br>
ingredient or excipient is dissolved in a solution<br>
other than the mother liquor, and the protein crystals<br><br>
are removed from the mother liquor and suspended in the<br>
excipient or ingredient solution. The ingredient or<br>
excipient concentrations and the incubation times are<br>
the same as those described above.<br>
	Slow Release Forms and Vaccines<br>
In another embodiment of this invention,<br>
encapsulation of lipases in polymeric carriers provide<br>
compositions useful to treat patients suffering from<br>
intestinal lipase deficiency. Such patients include<br>
those with pancreatic steatorrhea, due to advanced<br>
pancreatic insufficiency require oral lipase<br>
supplementation. Unfortunately, current therapeutic<br>
methods may not be flexible enough to protect the<br>
active lipase during transit through the gastro-<br>
intestinal tract and to release the enzyme activity<br>
where it is critically needed in the small bowel (See<br>
L. Guarner et al., "Fate of oral enzymes in pancreatic<br>
insufficiency," Gut, vol. 34, pp. 708-712, (1993)).<br>
The flexibility of the present invention in preparing<br>
slowly available active lipase solves the present<br>
problems often associated with lipase supplementation.<br>
According to one embodiment of this invention, the<br>
combination of encapsulated lipase crystals<br>
(compositions) and unencapsulated crosslinked lipasecrystals or formulations provides a drug therapy regime<br>
in which enzyme activity is available early on from the<br>
unencapsulated crosslinked lipase. As this material<br>
undergoes proteolytic degradation, the encapsulated<br>
enzyme (composition) begins to release enzyme activity<br>
into the more distal bowel. A similar strategy may be<br>
used to solve other enzyme or therapeutic protein<br>
supplementation problems.<br><br>
The present invention may also utilize other<br>
slow release methodologies, such as silicon based rings<br>
or rods which have been preloaded with encapsulated<br>
protein crystals containing hormones, antibodies or<br>
enzymes or compositions containing them. The purpose<br>
of this technique is to provide a constant level of<br>
protein to the bloodstream over a period of weeks or<br>
months. Such implants can be inserted intradermally<br>
and can be safely replaced and removed when needed.<br>
Other formulations and compositions according<br>
to this invention include vaccine formulations and<br>
compositions comprising protein (antigen) crystals,<br>
adjuvant and encapsulating polymer(s). The protein<br>
antigen may be a viral glycoprotein, viral structural<br>
protein, viral enzyme, bacterial protein, or some<br>
engineered homolog of a viral or bacterial protein, or<br>
any immunopotentiating protein, such as a cytokine.<br>
One embodiment of such formulations or compositions<br>
involves a single vaccine injection containing<br>
microspheres having three or more different release<br>
profiles. In this way, antigen formulations or<br>
composition may be released over a sustained period<br>
sufficient to generate lasting immunity. By virtue of<br>
this formulation or composition, multiple antigen<br>
boosts may be in single unit form. The faster<br>
degrading preparation (composition) may contain an<br>
immunogenic adjuvant to enhance the immune response.<br>
One advantage of such a system is that by using protein<br>
crystals, the native three-dimensional structures of<br>
the epitopes are maintained and presented to the immune<br>
system in their native form.<br>
Once the immune system is primed, there may<br>
be less need for an adjuvant effect. Therefore, in the<br>
slower degrading inoculations, a less immunogenic<br><br>
adjuvant may be included and possibly no adjuvant may<br>
be required in the slowest degrading microspheres of<br>
the formulations and compositions . In this way,<br>
patient populations in remote areas will not have to be<br>
treated multiple times in order to provide protection<br>
against infectious diseases. One of skill in the art<br>
of biological delivery of proteins will appreciate that<br>
many variations on this theme are feasible.<br>
Accordingly, the examples provided here are not<br>
intended to limit the invention.<br>
In another embodiment of this invention, a<br>
combination vaccine could be produced, whereby immunity<br>
to multiple diseases is induced in a single injection.<br>
As discussed above, microspheres having different<br>
release profiles may be combined alone or in<br>
formulations and compositions and may include<br>
microspheres containing antigens from multiple<br>
infectious agents to produce a combination vaccine<br>
(formulations and compositions). For example,<br>
microspheres having multiple release profiles and<br>
containing antigen crystals of measles, mumps, rubella,<br>
polio and hepatitis B agents could be combined and<br>
administered to children. Alternatively, microspheres<br>
having multiple release profiles and containing<br>
crystals of different isolates of HIV gpl20 could be<br>
combined to produce a vaccine for HIV-1 or HIV-2.<br>
Another advantage of the present invention is<br>
that the protein crystals encapsulated within polymeric<br>
carriers and forming a composition comprising<br>
microspheres can be dried by lyophilization.<br>
Lyophilization, or freeze-drying allows water to be<br>
separated from the composition. The protein crystal<br>
composition is first frozen and then placed in a high<br>
vacuum. In a vacuum, the crystalline H2O sublimes,<br><br>
leaving the protein crystal composition behind<br>
containing only the tightly bound water. Such<br>
processing further stabilizes the composition and<br>
allows for easier storage and transportation at<br>
typically encountered ambient temperatures.<br>
This feature is especially desirable for<br>
therapeutic proteins and vaccines which can be<br>
dispensed into single dose sterile containers<br>
("ampules") or alternatively, any desired increment of<br>
a single dose as a slurry, in a formulation or a<br>
composition. The ampules containing the dispensed<br>
slurries, formulations or compositions can then be<br>
capped, batch frozen and lyophilized under sterile<br>
conditions. Such sterile containers can be transported<br>
throughout the world and stored at ambient<br>
temperatures. Such a system would be useful for<br>
providing sterile vaccines and therapeutic proteins to<br>
remote and undeveloped parts of the world. At the<br>
point of use, the ampule is rehydrated with the sterile<br>
solvent or buffer of choice and dispensed. Under this<br>
scenario, minimal or no refrigeration is required.<br>
Protein Crystallization<br>
Protein crystals are grown by controlled<br>
crystallization of protein from aqueous solutions or<br>
aqueous solutions containing organic solvents.<br>
Solution conditions that may be controlled include, for<br>
example, the rate of evaporation of solvent, organic<br>
solvents, the presence of appropriate co-solutes and<br>
buffers, pH and temperature. A comprehensive review of<br>
the various factors affecting the crystallization of<br>
proteins has been published by McPherson, Methods<br>
Enzvmol., 114, pp. 112-20 (1985).<br><br>
McPherson and Gilliland, J. Crystal Growth,<br>
90, pp. 51-59 (1988) have compiled comprehensive lists<br>
of proteins and nucleic acids that have been<br>
crystallized, as well as the conditions under which<br>
they were crystallized. A compendium of crystals and<br>
crystallization recipes, as well as a repository of<br>
coordinates of solved protein and nucleic acid<br>
structures, is maintained by the Protein Data Bank at<br>
the Brookhaven National Laboratory [http//www.<br>
pdb.bnl.gov; Bernstein et al., J. Mol. Biol., 112,<br>
pp. 535-42 (1977)]. These references can be used to<br>
determine the conditions necessary for crystallization<br>
of a protein, as a prelude to the formation of<br>
appropriate protein crystals and can guide the<br>
crystallization strategy for other proteins.<br>
Alternatively, an intelligent trial and error search<br>
strategy can, in most instances, produce suitable<br>
crystallization conditions for many proteins, provided<br>
that an acceptable level of purity can be achieved for<br>
them [see, e.g., C.W. Carter, Jr. and C.W. Carter,<br>
J. Biol. Chem., 254, pp. 12219-23 (1979)].<br>
In general, crystals are produced by<br>
combining the protein to be crystallized with an<br>
appropriate aqueous solvent or aqueous solvent<br>
containing appropriate crystallization agents, such as<br>
salts or organic solvents. The solvent is combined<br>
with the protein and may be subjected to agitation at a<br>
temperature determined experimentally to be appropriate<br>
for the induction of crystallization and acceptable for<br>
the maintenance of protein activity and stability. The<br>
solvent can optionally include co-solutes, such as<br>
divalent cations, co-factors or chaotropes, as well as<br>
buffer species to control pH. The need for co-solutes<br><br>
and their concentrations are determined experimentally<br>
to facilitate crystallization.<br>
It is critical to differentiate between<br>
amorphous precipitates and crystalline material.<br>
Crystalline material is a form of the solid state of<br>
matter, which is distinct from the amorphous solid<br>
state. Crystals display characteristic features<br>
including a lattice structure, characteristic shapes<br>
and optical properties such as refractive index and<br>
birefringence. A crystal consists of atoms arranged in<br>
a pattern that repeats periodically in three<br>
dimensions. In contrast, amorphous material is a non-<br>
crystalline solid form of matter, sometimes referred to<br>
as an amorphous precipitate. Such precipitates have no<br>
molecular lattice structure characteristic of the<br>
crystalline solid state and do not display<br>
birefringence or other spectroscopic characteristics<br>
typical of the crystalline forms of matter.<br>
In an industrial-scale process, the<br>
controlled precipitation leading to crystallization can<br>
best be carried out by the simple combination of<br>
protein, precipitant, co-solutes and, optionally,<br>
buffers in a batch process. As another option,<br>
proteins may be crystallized by using protein<br>
precipitates as the starting material. In this case,<br>
protein precipitates are added to a crystallization<br>
solution and incubated until crystals form.<br>
Alternative laboratory crystallization methods, such as<br>
dialysis or vapor diffusion, can also be adopted.<br>
McPherson, supra and Gilliland, supra, include a<br>
comprehensive list of suitable conditions in their<br>
reviews of the crystallization literature.<br>
Occasionally, in cases in which the<br>
crystallized protein is to be crosslinked,<br><br>
incompatibility between an intended crosslinking agent<br>
and the crystallization medium might require exchanging<br>
the crystals into a more suitable solvent system.<br>
Many of the proteins for which<br>
crystallization conditions have already been described,<br>
may be used to prepare protein crystals according to<br>
this invention. It should be noted, however, that the<br>
conditions reported in most of the above-cited<br>
references have been optimized to yield, in most<br>
instances, a few large, diffraction quality crystals.<br>
Accordingly, it will be appreciated by those of skill<br>
in the art that some degree of adjustment of these<br>
conditions to provide a high yielding process for the<br>
large scale production of the smaller crystals used in<br>
making protein crystals the present invention may be<br>
necessary.<br>
. Crosslinking of Protein Crystals<br>
According to one embodiment of this<br>
invention, for example, the release rate of the protein<br>
from the polymeric carrier (composition) may be slowed<br>
and controlled by using protein crystals that have been<br>
chemically crosslinked using a crosslinker, such as for<br>
example, a biocompatible crosslinker. Thus, once<br>
protein crystals have been grown in a suitable medium<br>
they may be crosslinked.<br>
Crosslinking may be carried out using<br>
reversible crosslinkers, in parallel or in sequence.<br>
The resulting crosslinked protein crystals are<br>
characterized by a reactive multi-functional linker,<br>
into which a trigger is incorporated as a separate<br>
group. The reactive functionality is involved in<br>
linking together reactive amino acid side chains in a<br>
protein and the trigger consists of a bond that can be<br><br>
broken by altering one or more conditions in the<br>
surrounding environment (e.g., pH, temperature, or<br>
thermodynamic water activity). This is illustrated<br>
diagrammatically as:<br>
X-Y-Z + 2 AA residues --&gt; AA1 -X-Y-Z-AA2<br>
change in environment --&gt; AA1-X+Y—Z-AA2<br>
—	where X and Z are groups with reactive<br>
functionality<br>
—	where Y is a trigger<br>
—	where AA1 and AA2 represent reactive amino<br>
acid residues on the same protein or on two different<br>
proteins. The bond between the crosslinking agent and<br>
the protein may be a covalent or ionic bond, or a<br>
hydrogen bond. The change in surrounding environment<br>
results in breaking of the trigger bond and dissolution<br>
of the protein. Thus, when the crosslinks within<br>
protein crystals crosslinked with such reversible<br>
crosslinking agents break, dissolution of protein<br>
crystal begins and therefore the release of activity.<br>
Alternatively, the reactive functionality of<br>
the crosslinker and the trigger may be the same, as in:<br>
X-Z + 2AA residues --&gt; AA1-X-Z-AA2<br>
change in environment --&gt; AA1 + X—Z-AA2.<br>
The crosslinker may be homofunctional (X=Y)<br>
or heterofunctional (X is not equal to Y). The<br>
reactive functionality X and Y may be, but not limited<br>
to the following functional groups (where R, R', R" and<br>
R'" may be alkyl, aryl or hydrogen groups):<br>
I. Reactive acyl donors are exemplified by:<br>
carboxylate esters RCOOR', amides RCONHR', Acyl azides<br>

II.	Reactive carbonyl groups are exemplified<br>
by: aldehydes RCHO and ketones RCOR', acetals<br>
RCO(H2)R', ketals RR'CO2R'R". Reactive carbonyl<br>
containing functional groups known to those well<br>
skilled in the art of protein immobilization and<br>
crosslinking are described in the literature fPierce<br>

Table 1 below includes examples of triggers,<br>
organized by release mechanism. In Table 1, R= is a<br>
multifunctional crosslinking agent that can be an<br>
alkyl, aryl, or other chains with activating groups<br>
that can react with the protein to be crosslinked.<br>
Those reactive groups can be any variety of groups such<br>
as those susceptible to nucleophilic, free radical or<br>
electrophilic displacement including halides,<br>
aldehydes, carbonates, urethanes, xanthanes, epoxides<br>
among others.<br><br><br><br><br>
Additional examples of reversible crosslinkers<br>
are described in T.W. Green, Protective Groups in<br>
Organic Synthesis, John Wiley &amp; Sons (Eds.) (1981).<br>
Any variety of strategies used for reversible<br>
protecting groups can be incorporated into a<br>
crosslinker suitable for producing crosslinked protein<br>
crystals capable of reversible, controlled<br>
solubilization. Various approaches are listed, in<br>
Waldmann's review of this subject, in Angewante Chemie<br>
Inl. Ed. Engl.. 35, p. 2056 (1996) .<br>
Other types of reversible crosslinkers are<br>
disulfide bond-containing crosslinkers. The trigger<br>
breaking crosslinks formed by such crosslinkers is the<br><br>
addition of reducing agent, such as cysteine, to the<br>
environment of the crosslinked protein crystals.<br>

patent application PCT/US91/05415.<br>
Encapsulation of Protein Crystals in<br>
Polymeric Carriers<br>
According to one embodiment of this<br>
invention, compositions are produced when protein<br>
crystals are encapsulated in at least one polymeric<br>
carrier to form microspheres by virtue of encapsulation<br>
within the matrix of the polymeric carrier to preserve<br>
their native and biologically active tertiary<br>
structure. The crystals can be encapsulated using<br><br>
various biocompatible and/or biodegradable polymers<br>
having unique properties which are suitable for<br>
delivery to different biological environments or for<br>
effecting specific functions. The rate of dissolution<br>
and, therefore, delivery of active protein is<br>
determined by the particular encapsulation technique,<br>
polymer composition, polymer crosslinking, polymer<br>
thickness, polymer solubility, protein crystal geometry<br>
and degree and, if any, of protein crystal crosslinking<br>
Protein crystals or formulations to be<br>
encapsulated are suspended in a polymeric carrier which<br>
is dissolved in an organic solvent. The polymer<br>
solution must be concentrated enough to completely coat<br>
the protein crystals or formulations after they are<br>
added to the solution. Such an amount is one which<br>
provides a weight ratio of protein crystals to polymer<br>
between about 0.02 and about 20, preferably between<br>
about 0.1 and about 2. The protein crystals are<br>
contacted with polymer in solution for a period of time<br>
between about 0.5 minutes and about 30 minutes,<br>
preferably between about 1 minutes and about 3 minutes.<br>
The crystals should be kept suspended and not allowed<br>
to aggregate as they are coated by contact with the<br>
polymer.<br>
Following that contact, the crystals become<br>
coated and are referred to as nascent microspheres.<br>
The nascent microspheres increase in size while coating<br>
occurs. In a preferred embodiment of the invention,<br>
the suspended coated crystals or nascent microspheres<br>
along with the polymeric carrier and organic solvent<br>
are transferred to a larger volume of an aqueous<br>
solution containing a surface active agent, known as an<br>
emulsifier. In the aqueous solution, the suspended<br>
nascent microspheres are immersed in the aqueous phase,<br><br>
where the organic solvent evaporates or diffuses away<br>
from the polymer. Eventually, a point is reached where<br>
the polymer is no longer soluble and forms a<br>
precipitated phase encapsulating the protein crystals<br>
or formulations to form a composition. This aspect of<br>
the process is referred to as hardening of the<br>
polymeric carrier or polymer. The emulsifier helps to<br>
reduce the interfacial surface tension between the<br>
various phases of matter in the system during the<br>
hardening phase of the process. Alternatively, if the<br>
coating polymer has some inherent surface activity,<br>
there may be no need for addition of a separate surface<br>
active agent.<br>
Emulsifiers useful to prepare encapsulated<br>
protein crystals according to this invention include<br>
poly(vinyl alcohol) as exemplified herein, surfactants<br>
and other surface active agents which can reduce the<br>
surface tension between the polymer coated protein<br>
crystals or polymer coated crystal formulations and the<br>
solution.<br>
Organic solvents useful to prepare the<br>
microspheres of the present invention include methylene<br>
chloride, ethyl acetate, chloroform and other non-toxic<br>
solvents which will depend on the properties of the<br>
polymer. Solvents should be chosen that solubilize the<br>
polymer and are ultimately non-toxic.<br>
A preferred embodiment of this invention is<br>
that the crystallinity of the protein crystals is<br>
maintained during the encapsulation process. The<br>
crystallinity is maintained during the coating process<br>
by using an organic solvent in which the crystals are<br>
not soluble. Subsequently, once the coated crystals<br>
are transferred to the aqueous solvent, rapid hardening<br>
of the polymeric carrier and sufficient coating of the<br><br>
crystals in the previous step shields the crystalline<br>
material from dissolution. In another embodiment, the<br>
use of crosslinked protein crystals facilitates<br>
maintenance of crystallinity in both the aqueous and<br>
organic solvents.<br>
The polymers used as polymeric carriers to<br>
coat the protein crystals can be either homo-polymers<br>
or co-polymers. The rate of hydrolysis of the<br>
microspheres is largely determined by the hydrolysis<br>
rate of the individual polymer species. In general,<br>
the rate of hydrolysis decreases as follows:<br>
polycarbonates &gt; polyesters &gt; polyurethanes &gt;<br>
polyorthoesters &gt; polyamides. For a review of<br>
biodegradable and biocompatible polymers, see W.R.<br>
Gombotz and D.K. Pettit, "Biodegradable polymers for<br>
protein and peptide drug delivery", Bioconjugate<br>
Chemistry, vol. 6, pp. 332-351 (1995).<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the polymeric<br>
carrier is composed of a single polymer type such as<br>
PLGA. In a next preferred embodiment, the polymeric<br>
carrier can be a mixture of polymers such as 50% PLGA<br>
and 50% albumin.<br>
Other polymers useful as polymeric carriers<br>
to prepare encapsulated protein crystals according to<br>
this invention include biocompatible/biodegradable<br>
polymers selected from the group consisting of poly<br>
(acrylic acid), poly (cyanoacrylates), poly (amino<br>
acids), poly (anhydrides), poly (depsipeptide), poly<br>
(esters), such as poly (lactic acid) or PLA, poly (b-<br>
hydroxybutryate), poly (caprolactone) and poly<br>
(dioxanone); poly (ethylene glycol), poly<br>
(hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide, poly<br>
[ (organo)phosphazene], poly (ortho esters), poly (vinyl<br>

albumin, alginate, cellulose and cellulose derivatives,<br>
collagen, fibrin, gelatin, hyaluronic acid,<br>

polysaccharides, blends and copolymers thereof.<br>
Other useful polymers are described in J. Heller and<br>

Delivery from Biodegradable Polymers," Academic Press,<br>

Microencapsulation, vol. 5, p. 125 (1988). The<br>
preferred polymer will depend upon the particular<br>
protein component of the protein crystals used and the<br>
intended use of the encapsulated crystals (formulations<br>
and compositions) . Alternatively, the solvent<br>
evaporation technique may be used for encapsulating<br>
protein crystals (see D. Babay, A. Hoffmann and S.<br>
Benita, Biomaterials vol. 9, pp. 482-488 (1988) .<br>
In a preferred embodiment of this invention,<br>
protein crystals are encapsulated in at least one<br>
polymeric carrier using a double emulsion method, as<br>
illustrated herein, using a polymer, such as<br>
polylactic-co-glycolyic acid. In a most preferred<br>
embodiment of this invention, the polymer is<br>
Polylactic-co-glycolyic acid ("PLGA"). PLGA is a co-<br>
polymer prepared by polycondensation reactions with<br>
lactic acid ("L") and glycolic acid ("G"). Various<br>
ratios of L and G can be used to modulate the<br>
crystallinity and hydrophobicity of the PLGA polymer.<br>
Higher crystallinity of the polymer results in slower<br>
dissolution. PLGA polymers with 20-70% G content tend<br>
to be amorphous solids, while high level of either G or<br>
L result in good polymer crystallinity. For more<br><br>
information on preparing PLGA, see D.K. Gilding and<br>
A.M. Reed, "Biodegradable polymers for use in surgery-<br>
poly (glycolic) /poly (lactic acid) homo and copolymers:<br>
1., Polymer vol. 20, pp. 1459-1464 (1981). PLGA<br>
degrades after exposure to water by hydrolysis of the<br>
ester bond linkage to yield non-toxic monomers of<br>
lactic acid and glycolic acid.<br>
In another embodiment, double-walled polymer<br>
coated microspheres may be advantageous. Double-walled<br>
polymer coated microspheres may be produced by<br>
preparing two separate polymer solutions in methylene<br>
chloride or other solvent which can dissolve the<br>
polymers. The protein crystals are added to one of the<br>
solutions and dispersed. Here, the protein crystals<br>
become coated with the first polymer. Then, the<br>
solution containing the first polymer coated protein<br>
crystals is combined with the second polymer solution.<br>
[See Pekarek, K.J.; Jacob, J.S. and Mathiowitz, E.<br>
Double-walled polymer microspheres for controlled drug<br>
release, Nature, 367, 258-260]. Now, the second<br>
polymer encapsulates the first polymer which is<br>
encapsulating the protein crystal. Ideally, this<br>
solution is then dripped into a larger volume of an<br>
aqueous solution containing a surface active agent or<br>
emulsifier. In the aqueous solution, the solvent<br>
evaporates from the two polymer solutions and the<br>
polymers are precipitated.<br>
The above process can be performed using<br>
either protein crystals, DNA or RNA crystals, of<br>
formulations of any of these to produce compositions.<br>
Formulations according to this invention<br>
comprise a protein crystal, and, at least one<br>
ingredient. Such formulations are characterized by at<br>
least a 60 fold greater shelf life when stored at 50 °C<br><br>
than the soluble form of said protein in solution at 50<br>
°C, as measured by T1/2. Alternatively, they are<br>
characterized by at least a 59 fold greater shelf life<br>

characterized by the loss of less than 20% α-helical<br>
structural content of the protein after storage for 4<br>
days at 50 °C, wherein the soluble form of said protein<br>
loses more than 50% of its a-helical structural<br>
content after storage for 6 hours at 50 °C, as measured<br>
by FTIR. Alternatively, they are characterized by. the<br>
loss of less than 20% a-helical structural content of<br>
the protein after storage for 4 days at 50 °C, wherein<br>
the soluble form of said protein loses more than 50% of<br>
its a-helical structural content after storage for 6<br>
hours at 50 °C, as measured by FTIR, and wherein said<br>
formulation is characterized by at least a 60 fold<br>
greater shelf life when stored at 50 °C than the soluble<br>

formulations, and, at least one polymeric carrier,<br>
wherein said formulation is encapsulated within a matix<br>

Alternatively, compositions according to this<br>
invention comprise formulations of a protein crystal<br>
and at least one ingredient. Such compositions may be<br>

In order that this invention may be better<br>
understood, the following examples are set forth.<br>
These examples are for the purpose of illustration only<br>
and are not to be construed as limiting the scope of<br>
the invention in any manner.<br><br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1 LIPASE<br>
Candida rugosa lipase crystallization:<br>
Materials:<br>
A - Candida rugosa lipase powder<br>
B - Celite powder (diatomite earth)<br>
C - MPD (2-Methyl-2,4-Pentanediol)<br>
D - 5mM Ca acetate buffer pH 4.6<br>
E - Deionized water<br>
Procedure:<br>
A 1 kg aliquot of lipase powder was mixed<br>
well with 1 kg of celite and then 22 L of distilled<br>
water was added. - The mixture was stirred to dissolve<br>
the lipase powder. After dissolution was complete, the<br>
pH was adjusted to 4.8 using acetic acid. Next, the<br>
solution was filtered to remove celite and undissolved<br>
materials. Then, the filtrate was pumped through a 30k<br>
cut-off hollow fiber to remove all the proteins that<br>
were less than 30kD molecular weight. Distilled water<br>
was added and the lipase filtrate was pumped through<br>
the hollow fiber until the retentate conductivity was<br>
equal to the conductivity of the distilled water. At<br>
this point, the addition of distilled water was stopped<br>
and 5mm Ca-acetate buffer was added. Next, Ca-acetate<br>
buffer was delivered by pumping through the hollow<br>
fiber until the conductivity of the retentate was equal<br>
to the conductivity of the Ca-acetate buffer. At that<br>
point, addition of the buffer was stopped. The lipase<br>
solution was concentrated to 30 mg/ml solution. The<br>
crystallization was initiated by pumping MPD slowly<br>
into the lipase solution while stirring. Addition of<br>
MPD was continued until a 20% vol/vol of MPD was<br><br>
reached. The mixture was stirred for 24 hr or until<br>
90% of the protein had crystallized. The resulting.<br>
crystals were washed with crystallization buffer to<br>
remove all the soluble material from the crystals.<br>
Then, the crystals were suspended in fresh<br>
crystallization buffer to achieve a protein<br>
concentration of 42 mg/ml.<br>
Example 2<br>
Formulation of lipase crystals using sucrose<br>
as excipient;<br>
In order to enhance the stability of lipase<br>
crystals during drying and storage the crystals were<br>
formulated with excipients. In this example, lipase<br>
crystals were formulated in the slurry form in the<br>
presence of mother liquor before drying. Sucrose<br>
(Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) was added to lipase<br>
crystals in mother liquor as an excipient. Sufficient<br>
sucrose was added to lipase crystals at a protein<br>
concentration of 20 mgs/ml in mother liquor (10 mM<br>
sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.8 containing 10 mM Calcium<br>
chloride and 20% MPD) to reach a final concentration of<br>
10%. The resulting suspension was tumbled at room<br>
temperature for 3 hr. After treatment with sucrose,<br>
the crystals were separated from the liquid by<br>
centrifugation as described in Example 6, method 4 or<br>
5.<br>
Example 3<br>
Formulation of lipase crystals using<br>
trehalose as excipient:<br>
The lipase crystals were formulated as in<br>
Example 2, by adding trehalose, instead of sucrose,<br><br>
(Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO), to a final<br>
concentration of 10% in mother liquor. The resulring<br>
suspension was tumbled at room temperature for 3 hr and<br>
the crystals were separated from the liquid by<br>
centrifugation as described in Example 6, method 4 or<br>
5.<br>
Example 4<br>
Formulation of lipase crystals using<br>
polyethylene oxide (PEO) as excipient:<br>
Lipase crystals were formulated using 0.1%<br>
polyethylene oxide in water as follows. The crystals,<br>
in the mother liquor at 20 mg/ml were separated from<br>
the mother liquor by centrifugation at 1000 rpm in a<br>
Beckman GS-6R bench top centrifuge equipped with<br>
swinging bucket rotor. Next, the crystals were<br>
suspended in 0.1% polyethylene oxide for 3 hrs (Sigma<br>
Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) and then separated by<br>
centrifugation, as described in Example 6, method 4 or<br>
5.<br>
Example 5<br>
Formulation of lipase crystals using<br>
methoxypolvethvlene glycol (MOPEG) as excipient:<br>
Lipase crystals were formulated as in Example<br>

of sucrose, (final concentration) (Sigma Chemical Co.,<br>
St. Louis, MO) in mother liquor and separating after 3<br>
hrs by centrifugation, as in Example 6, method 4 or 5.<br><br>
Example 6<br>
Methods of drying crystal formulations:<br>
Method 1. N-. Gas Drying at Room Temperature<br>
Crystals as prepared in Examples 1, 10, 14 and 21<br>

Method 2. Vacuum Oven Drying<br>
Crystals as prepared in Examples 1, 10, 14 and 21<br>
were first separated from the mother<br>
liquor/excipient solution using centrifugation at<br>
1000 rpm in a Beckman GS-6R bench top centrifuge<br>
equipped with swinging bucket rotor in a 50 ml<br>

using a Virtis Lyophilizer Model 24 in<br><br>
semistoppered vials. The shelf temperature was<br>
slowly reduced to -40 °C during the freezing step.<br>
This temperature was held for 16 hrs. Secondary<br>
drying was then carried out for another 8 hrs.<br>
Method 4. Organic Solvent and Air Drying<br>

in the fume hood for two days.<br><br>
Example 7<br>
Soluble lipase sample preparation:<br>
For comparison, a sample of soluble lipase<br>
was prepared by dissolving lipase crystals to 20 mg/ml<br>
in phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4.<br>
Figure 2 shows the stability for soluble<br>
lipase. Specific activity decreases extremely rapidly<br>
with time. Within 2-3 hours, the specific activity<br>
decreases from about 660 umoles/min/mg protein to about<br>
100 umoles/min/mg protein or an approximate 85%<br>
decrease. The T1/2 for soluble lipase was calculated to<br>
be 1.12 hours.<br>
Example 8<br>
Olive oil assay for measuring lipase<br>
activity:<br>
Lipase crystals from Examples 1-7 were<br>
assessed for activity against olive oil in pH 7.7<br>
buffer. The assay was carried out titrimetrically<br>
using slight modifications to the procedure described<br>
in Pharmaceutical Enzymes - Properties and Assay<br>
Methods, R. Ruyssen and A. Lauwers, (Eds.), Scientific<br>
Publishing Company, Ghent, Belgium (1978).<br>
Reagents:<br>
1.	Olive oil emulsion:<br>
16.5 gm of gum arabic (Sigma) was dissolved in 180<br>
ml of water, 20 ml of olive oil (Sigma) and<br>
emulsified using a Quick Prep mixer for 3 minutes.<br>
2.	Titrant : 0.05 M NaOH<br>
3.	Solution A: 3.0 M NaCl<br>
4.	Solution B: 75 mM CaCl2.2H20<br><br>
5.	Mix: 40 ml of Solution A was combined with 20<br>
ml of Solution B and 100 ml of H20.<br>
6.	0.5% Albumin:<br>
7.	Lipase Substrate Solution (solution 7) was<br>
prepared by adding 50 ml of olive oil emulsion<br>
(solution 1) to 40 ml of Mix (solution 5) and 10<br>
ml of 0.5% albumin (solution 6).<br>
Assay Procedure<br>
The lipase substrate solution (solution 7)<br>
was warmed to 37°c in a water bath. First, 20 ml of<br>
substrate was added to a reaction vessel and the pH was<br>
adjusted to 7.7 using 0.05 M NaOH (solution 2) and<br>
equilibrated to 37°C with stirring. The reaction was<br>
initiated by adding enzyme. The reaction progress was<br>
monitored by titrating the mixture of enzyme and<br>
substrate with 0.05 M NaOH to maintain the pH at 7.7.<br>
The specific activity (umoles/min/mg protein)<br>
was equal to the initial rate x 1000 x concentration of<br>
the titrant/the amount of enzyme. The zero point was<br>
determined by running the reaction without enzyme,<br>
i.e., using buffer in the place of enzyme in the<br>
reaction mixture.<br>
Example 9<br>
Activity:<br>
The shelf activity of the dried crystals from<br>
Examples 1-5 was measured using the olive oil assay as<br>
described in Example 8. Dried crystals (5 mg) were<br>
dissolved in 1 ml of phosphate buffered saline ("PBS"),<br>
pH 7.4 and the activity was measured using olive oil as<br>
substrate.<br><br>
Shelf stability:<br>
The shelf stability of dried crystalline<br>
lipase formulations from Examples 2-5 was carried out<br>
in a humidity chamber controlled at 75% relative<br>
humidity and 40°C temperature (HOTPACK) . The activity<br>
of the crystals was measured by dissolving 5 mg of the<br>
dried samples in PBS buffer, pH 7.4, measuring the<br>
activity in the olive oil assay and then comparing with<br>
the initial results. <br>
Crystal Formulations Dried by Method 5<br>
Figure 3 shows the shelf stability profile of<br>
lipase crystals formulated with sucrose, trehalose and<br>
PEO. When dried by method 5, PEO was the most<br>
protective excipient, followed by sucrose and then<br>
trehalose.<br>
Crystal Formulations Dried by Method 4<br>
Figure 4 shows the shelf stability profile of<br>
lipase crystals formulated with sucrose, trehalose, PEO<br>
and MOPEG. When dried by method 4, the excipients PEO,<br>
sucrose and MOPEG were similar in their ability to<br>
preserve enzyme activity as measured by their effect on<br>
the T1/2. Trehalose was less protective of lipase<br>
activity than the other excipients.<br>
Shelf Stability<br>
The time required for the specific activity<br>
of the enzyme to decrease by 50% is known as the T1/2.<br>
Table 2 shows the effect on the T1/2 of the specific<br>
activity for formulations of dried lipase crystals.<br>
For lipase, sucrose was the most protective excipient,<br>
followed by polyethylene oxide (PEO) , methoxypoly<br>
ethylene glycol (MOPEG) and finally trehalose. Sucrose<br><br>
was more than 10-fold more protective, as measured by<br>
its effect on T1/2 of specific activity.<br>
Table 2. Lipase at 40°C and 75% humidity<br><br>
The T1/2 was calculated from the shelf life<br>
data by non-linear regression analysis using the Sigma<br>
Plot program. Table 2 shows that formulations of<br>
lipase were 1,923 fold more stable than soluble when<br>
PEO was used as the excipient. In addition,<br>
formulations of lipase were 23,300 fold more stable<br>
than soluble lipase when sucrose was used as the<br>
excipient (Table 2). Formulations using MOPEG and PEO<br>
as excipients with lipase crystals were 9,270 and<br>
17,800 fold more stable than soluble lipase (Table 2).<br>
The stability of the formulated crystals<br>
relative to the non-formulated crystals was greatly<br>
enhanced, as shown in Table 2. For example, crystals<br>
formulated with trehalose were 59 fold more stable than<br>
non-formulated lipase crystals made without an<br>
excipient at 40 °C, as shown in Table 2. Similarly,<br>
crystals formulated with MOPEG were 28 6 fold more<br>
stable than non-formulated crystals and crystals<br>
formulated with PEO were 54 9 fold more stable than non-<br>
formulated lipase crystals made without an excipient at<br>
40 °C, as shown in Table 2. Finally, crystals<br>
formulated with sucrose were 718 fold more stable than<br><br>
non-formulated lipase crystals made without an<br>
excipient at 40 °C, as shown in Table 2.<br>
Moisture content:<br>
Moisture content was determined by the Karl<br>
Fischer method according to manufacturer's instructions<br>
using a Mitsubishi CA-06 Moisture Meter equipped with a<br>
VA-06 Vaporizer (Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation,<br>
Tokyo, Japan).<br>
Table 3. Moisture content lipase crystal formulations<br><br>
Crystallinity:<br>
The crystal integrity of the formulations<br>
were measured by quantitative microscopic observations.<br>
In order to visualize whether the crystals were<br>
maintained their shape after drying, the dried crystals<br>
were examined under an Olympus BX60 microscope equipped<br>
with DXC-970MD 3CCD Color Video Camera with Camera<br>
Adapter (CMA D2) with Image ProPlus software. Samples<br>
of dried crystals were covered with a glass coverslip,<br>
mounted and examined under 10X magnification, using an<br>
Olympus microscope with an Olympus UPLAN F1 objective<br>
lens 10X/0.30 PH1 (phase contrast).<br>
In this analysis, the crystals originally<br>
formulated with sucrose, trehalose, PEO and MOPEG were<br>
readily visualized after 129 days at 40 °C and 75%<br>
humidity. Figure 5 shows that crystals formulated with<br>
PEO were present at the initial time. A similar<br><br>
microscopic observation taken 129 days later and shown<br>
in Figure 6 demonstrates that crystallinity was<br>
maintained for the entire time period. Similar data<br>
was obtained for crystals formulated with sucrose,<br>
MOPEG and trehalose (data not shown).<br>
Secondary structure characterization by FTIR:<br>
The fourier transform infrared ("FTIR")<br>
spectra were collected on a Nicolet model 550 Magna<br>
series spectrometer as described by Dong et al. [Dong,<br>
A., Caughey, B., Caughey, W.S., Bhat, K.S. and Coe,<br>
J.E. Biochemistry, 1992; 31:9364-9370; Dong, A.<br>
Prestrelski, S.J., Allison, S.D. and Carpenter, J.F.<br>
J.Pharm. Sci., 1995; 84: 415-424.] For the solid<br>
samples, 1 to 2 mg of the protein was lightly ground<br>
with 350 mg of KBr powder and filled into small cups<br>
used for diffuse reflectance accessory. The spectra<br>
were collected and then processed using Grams 32 from<br>
Galactic software for the determination of relative<br>
areas of the individual components of secondary<br>
structure using second derivative and curve-fitting<br>
program under amide I region (1600-1700 cm-1) .<br>
For comparison, a soluble lipase sample was<br>
prepared by dissolving lipase crystals in phosphate<br>
buffered saline and analyzed for stability by FTIR.<br>
Secondary structure was determined as<br>
follows: FTIR spectra were collected on a Nicolet model<br>
550 Magna series spectrometer. A 1 ml sample of<br>
soluble lipase was placed on a Zinc selenide crystal of<br>
ARK ESP. The spectra were collected at initial (0)<br>
time and after the loss of most of the activity or,<br>
near-zero activity. The acquired data was then<br><br>
processed using Grams 32 software from Galactic<br>
Software for the determination of relative areas of the<br>
individual components of secondary structure using<br>
second derivative and curve-fitting program under amide<br>
I region (1600-1700 cm-1) .<br><br><br><br>
CONCLUSION:<br>
Table 4 shows that for soluble lipase,<br>
approximately 50% and 75 % of the α-helix and β-sheet<br>
structure content was lost over three days. There was<br>
a corresponding increase in the content of random<br>
structure.<br>
In contrast, Table 4 shows that crystals<br>
which were formulated and dried were much more stable<br>
than the soluble enzyme. Such crystals showed a loss<br>
of a-helical structure which ranged from 6.1% to 21.1%<br>
after 66 days at 40 °C and 75% humidity. At the same<br>
time, random coil in solution increased from 7-50% over<br>
3 days, while crystallinity showed minimum random coil<br>
content even after 66 days.<br>
The data in Table 4, obtained using FTIR to<br>
monitor changes in secondary structure, correlated with<br>
the activity data shown in Figure 4. In particular,<br>
lipase formulated with sucrose, PEO and MOPEG showed<br>
significantly less loss of α-helical structure and<br>
maintained a higher specific activity over the 66 day<br>
time period at elevated temperature and humidity than<br>
crystals formulated with trehalose, which showed a 21%<br>
loss of a-helical structure and had the lowest activity<br>
profile.<br>
Example 10 HUMAN SERUM ALBUMIN<br>
Crystallization of Human Serum Albumin<br>
Ten grams of powdered human serum albumin was<br>
added to a 75 ml stirred solution of 100 mM phosphate<br>
buffer (pH 5.5) at 4°C. Final protein concentration was<br>
120 mg/ml, estimated from the OD280 value of the<br><br>
solution. First, a saturated ammonium sulfate solution<br>
(767 g/l), prepared in deionized water, was added to<br>
the protein solution to a final concentration of<br>
350 g/1 or 50% saturation. Next, the crystallization<br>
solution was "seeded" with 1 ml of 50 mg/ml albumin<br>
crystals in 50% ammonium sulfate at pH 5.5. Seed<br>
crystals were prepared by washing a sample of crystals<br>
free of precipitate with a solution of 50% saturated<br>
ammonium sulfate in 100 mM phosphate buffer at pH 5.5.<br>
The seeded crystallization solution was incubated<br>
overnight at 4°C on a vigorously rotating platform.<br>
Crystals in the shape of rods (20 urn) appeared in the<br>
solution overnight after approximately 16 hr.<br>
Example 11<br>
Formulation of HSA crystals using gelatin as<br>
excipient:<br>
In order to enhance the stability of human<br>
serum albumin (HSA) crystals during drying and storage<br>
the crystals were formulated with excipients. In this<br>
example, HSA crystals were formulated in the slurry<br>
form in the presence of mother liquor before drying.<br>
Gelatin (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) was added<br>
to lipase crystals in mother liquor as an excipient.<br>
Sufficient gelatin was added to lipase crystals at a<br>
protein concentration 20 mgs/ml in mother liquor (2.5M<br>
ammonium sulfate in 100mM phosphate buffer, pH 5.5) to<br>
reach a final concentration of 10%. The resulting<br>
suspension was tumbled at room temperature for 3 hr.<br>
After treatment with gelatin, the crystals were<br>
separated from the liquid by centrifugation as<br>
described in Example 6, method 1.<br><br>
Drying of HSA crystals<br>
The HSA crystals were then dried by the four<br>
methods described in Example 6. The crystals were<br>
suspended in cold (4°C) ethanol as the organic solvent<br>
of method 4.<br>
Example 12<br>
Soluble human serum albumin preparation:<br>
For comparison, the soluble HSA sample was<br>
prepared by dissolving HSA crystals at 20mg/ml in<br>
water.<br>
Example 13<br>
Shelf stability:<br>
Shelf stability of HSA dried crystal<br>
formulations were carried out in a waterbath at 50°C<br>
temperature. The stability of the crystals was<br>
monitored by following structural degradation by FTIR<br>
analysis.<br>
Moisture content:<br>
Moisture content was determined by the Karl<br>
Fischer method according to manufacturer's instructions<br>
using a Mitsubishi CA-06 Moisture Meter equipped with a<br>
VA-06 Vaporizer (Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation,<br>
Tokyo, Japan).<br>

The crystal integrity of the formulations was<br>
measured by quantitative microscopic observations, as<br>
described in Example 9. Figure 7 shows that HSA<br>
crystals were readily visualized immediately after<br>
preparing the formulation with gelatin. Figure 8 shows<br>
that crystallinity was maintained after four days at 50<br>
°C.<br>
Secondary structure characterization by FTIR:<br>
The FTIR spectra were collected on a Nicolet<br>
model 550 Magna series spectrometer as described by<br>
Dong et al.[Dong, A., Caughey, B., Caughey, W.S., Bhat,<br>
K.S. and Coe, J.E. Biochemistry, 1992; 31:9364-9370;<br>
Dong, A. Prestrelski, S.J., Allison, S.D. and<br>
Carpenter, J.F. J.Pharm. Sci., 1995; 84: 415-424]. For<br>
the solid samples, 1 to 2 mg of the protein was lightly<br>
ground with 350 mg of KBr powder and filled into small<br>
cups used for diffuse reflectance accessory. The<br>
spectra were collected and processed using Grams 32<br>
from Galactic software for the determination of<br>
relative areas of the individual components of<br>
secondary structure using a second derivative and<br>
curve-fitting program under amide I region (1600 -1700<br>
cm"') .<br>
For comparison, the soluble HSA sample was<br>
prepared by dissolving HSA crystals in water and tested<br>
for stability by FTIR. The secondary structure was<br>
determined as in Example 9.<br><br><br>
CONCLUSION:<br>
Soluble HSA showed a rapid 78% decrease in α-<br>
helical content after 1 hour in solution and a<br>
corresponding increase in random coil structure.<br>
Dry formulated crystals showed an<br>
approximately 16% decrease in α-helical content, a<br>
large decrease in β-sheet content and no increase in<br>
the content of random structure.<br>
Example 14 PENICILLIN ACYLASE<br>
Crystallization of Penicillin Acvlase<br>
An ammonium sulfate suspension of Penicillin<br>
acylase from Boehringer Mannheim was the raw material.<br>
The suspension of Penicillin acylase was diluted 1:3<br>
with deionized water. This solution was concentrated<br><br>
by diafilration using a 30K membrane to a final<br>
concentration of 200 OD at A280nm /ml. The enzyme<br>
solution was then diluted with 4 M NaH2PO4.H20 to 150 OD<br>
A28onm /ml.<br>
A biphasic solution of 4 M and 1 M sufficient<br>
NaH2PO4.H20 to yield a final solution concentration of<br>
1.9 M NaPO4, was prepared. In this case, 280 ml of 1 M<br>
NaH2P4.H20 was carefully overlaid on top of to the top<br>
of 549 ml of 4 M NaH2PO4.H20. The enzyme solution was<br>
poured gently into the side of the container to form a<br>
layer above the 1 M layer. An overhead stirrer was set<br>
up with a marine impeller. The agitator was placed<br>
into the container with the blades just below the 4M/1M<br>
interface. The speed was adjusted to a setting of 8.0,<br>
or 600 rpm. The agitator was switched on and stopped<br>
after 10 minutes. The impeller was removed from the<br>
container. The volume of seed crystals was measured<br>
with a graduated pipette using between 0.5 and 0.1% by<br>
volume and added to the 20 L sterile polycarbonate<br>
container. The seed was not allowed to be static for<br>
more than 10 seconds before addition. The solution was<br>
mixed by hand using a flat-blade impeller for about 1<br>
minute. The crystallization mixture was allowed to<br>
stand for 24 hours.<br>
After 24 hours, the container was opened and<br>
the solution was mixed by hand for 30 seconds. The<br>
solution was allowed to sit for an additional 24 hours.<br>
After a total of 48 hours, a 10 ml sample was taken of<br>
the supernatant. The sample was filtered with a 0.2<br>

measured. When supernatant A280nm was greater than 1.0<br>
mg/ml, the crystallization was allowed to continue for<br>
24 more hours. When the supernatant concentration was<br><br>

Penicillin G Assay for PA Crystals<br>
The basis of the activity assay for<br>
Penicillin acylase involves a titrimetric assay which<br>
measures the enzymatic hydrolysis of benzyl penicillin<br>
by the enzyme. The enzyme catalyzes cleavage of a<br>
phenyl acetyl group from penicillin G thus causing a<br>
decrease in pH. This activity was followed by<br>
measuring the volume of 50 mM NaOH needed (to maintain<br>
a pH of 8 at 28°C) per minute of reaction. The assay<br>
uses a substrate buffer made with potassium chloride<br>
and Tris and was reported in U/mg.<br>
Penicillin acylase assay:<br>
Chemicals and solutions used in the assay:<br>
1.	Penicillin-G, Sigma, Potassium salt<br>
2.	0.05 N Sodium hydroxide<br>
3.	1.0 M KCl, 20 mM Tris buffer, pH 8.0<br>
4.	10 mM Tris, 10 mM CaCl2 buffer, pH 8.0<br>
5.	0.01 M PBS buffer, pH 7.5<br>
Preparation of substrate solution<br>
1 g of penicillin-G was added to 10 ml of<br>
1.0 M KC1, 20 mM Tris buffer, pH 8.0 solution and about<br>
70 ml, of DI water, 1 ml of 10 mM Tris, 10 mM CaCl2. Then<br>
the pH of the solution was adjusted to 8.0 using 0.05 N<br>
NaOH. Next, final solution volume was adjusted to 100<br><br>
ml. The solution was prepared fresh before each use<br>
and used within five hours of preparation.<br>
Preparation of PA sample solution<br>
A sample of Penicillin acylase was dissolved<br>
5 in PBS buffer, pH 7.4. Typically, 2 to 4 mg (dry<br>
weight) of protein were used for each assay.<br>
Assay for hydrolysis of penicillin G<br>
20 ml of penicillin acylase substrate<br>
solution was added to a titration vessel and<br>
equilibrated to 28 °C. After adding the enzyme solution<br>
to the reaction vessel, the hydrolysis of penicillin-G<br>
was monitored by titrating the reaction mixture with<br>
0.05 N NaOH to maintain the pH at 8.0.<br>
Example 16<br>
	Formulation of PA crystals using<br>
hydroxypropvl-β-cyclodextrin (HPCD)<br>
as excipient:<br>
In order to enhance the stability of PA<br>
crystals during drying and storage, the crystals were<br>
formulated with excipients. In this example, PA<br>
crystals were formulated in the slurry form in the<br>
presence of mother liquor before drying.<br>
Hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPCD) (Sigma Chemical<br>
Co., St. Louis, MO) was added to PA crystals in mother<br>
5 liquor as an excipient. Sufficient HPCD was added to<br>
lipase crystals at a protein concentration 20 mgs/m in<br>
mother liquor (1.9M NaH2PO4, pH 6.6), to reach a final<br>
concentration of 10%. The resulting suspension was<br>
tumbled at room temperature for 3 hr. After treatment<br><br>
with HPCD, the crystals were separated from the liquid<br>
by centrifugation as described in Example 6, method 1.<br>

As a standard of comparison, a sample of<br>
soluble PA was prepared by dissolving PA crystals in<br>
water at 20 mg/ml.<br>
The stability of soluble PA was measured over<br>
time and a plot specific activity at 55 °C versus time<br>
is shown in Figure 9. PA enzyme activity in solution<br>
decayed rapidly and was undetectable after<br>
approximately 20 hours.<br><br>
Example 20<br>
Activity of the dried crystals:<br>
The activity of the dried crystals from<br>
Example 18 was tested in the Pen G assay as described<br>
in Example 15. The dried crystals (5 mg) were<br>
dissolved in 1 ml of water and the activity was<br>
measured using Pen G as substrate<br>
Shelf stability.<br>
The shelf stability of PA dried crystal<br>
formulations was determined using a Reactive-Therm III<br>
- Heating /Stirring module by Pierce at 55°C<br>
temperature. Activities were measured by dissolving 5<br>
mg of the dried sample in water and measuring the<br>
enzyme activity in the Pen G assay described in Example<br>
15 and compared with the initial results. Figure 10<br>
depicts the shelf stability profiles of PA crystals<br>
with and without excipient. Figure 10 also depicts<br>
shelf stability profiles of PA crystal formulations<br>
dried with nitrogen (method 1) or air dried (method 4) .<br><br>
The T1/2 was calculated from the shelf life<br>
data by non-linear regression analysis using the Sigma<br>
Table 7. Penicillin acvlase activity at 55°C<br><br>
Plot program. The stability of the formulated crystals<br>
relative to the non-formulated crystals was enhanced,<br>
as shown in Table 7. For example, crystals formulated<br>
with HPCD were 418 fold more stable soluble PA at 55 °C<br>
(Table 7). Crystals formulated with HPCD were 3.5 fold<br>
more stable at 55 °C than non-formulated PA crystals<br>
made without an excipient, as shown in Table 7.<br>
Moisture content:<br>
Moisture content was determined by the Karl<br>
Fischer method according to manufacturer's instructions<br>
using a Mitsubishi CA-06 Moisture Meter equipped with a<br>
VA-06 Vaporizer (Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation,<br>
Tokyo, Japan).<br>

Crystallinity:<br>
The crystal integrity of the formulations was<br>
measured by quantitative microscopic observations as<br>
described in Example 9. Crystallinity was maintained<br>
through out the process as indicated by the crystals,<br>
which were readily visible (data not shown).<br><br>

day for soluble Penicillin acylase. In contrast, when<br>
HPCD was used as an excipient and the formulation was<br>
dried by method 1 of Example 6, only 31% of the α-<br>
helical content was lost after 43 days at 55 °C<br>

Example 21 GLUCOSE OXIDASE<br>
Preparation of Glucose Oxidase Crystals<br>
We prepared crystals of glucose oxidase as<br>
follows. First, the glycoprotein was purified by anion<br>
exchange chromatography and then the crystallization<br>
parameters were optimized (data not shown).<br>
As a result of these studies, we found that<br>
the conditions for crystallization of glucose oxidase<br>
fall generally in the range of 7 to 17% PEG 4000 or<br>
6000, 8 to 20% 2-propanol or ethanol and buffer to<br>
adjust the pH to between 3 and 6. It should be<br>
understood, however, that many sets of experimental<br>
conditions within and near this range can produce<br>
satisfactory results for the crystallization of glucose<br>
oxidase and other glycoproteins. Those of skill in the<br>
art will appreciate that the precise conditions which<br>
efficiently produce crystals of the desired size and<br>
quality, will vary due to differences in experimental<br>
conditions, such as protein and reagent purity, rates<br>
of stirring, shear force effects and carbohydrate<br>
content.<br><br>
Large Scale Crystallization of Glucose<br>
Oxidase<br>
We determined preferred conditions for<br>
preparative scale crystallization of glucose oxidase.<br>
Preparative scale crystallization generally involves<br>

2-propanol in 0.2 M Na-Acetate at pH 5.0. After<br>
mixing, the solution was cooled to 6°C. The glucose<br>
oxidase crystallization solution was stirred for 24<br>
hours at 100 rpm with a propeller stirrer. During this<br>
time, the crystals formed gradually.<br>

formulations of glucose oxidase crystals was performed.<br>
In this case, the formulations were dried by method 4<br>
of Example 6 and were stored in a 2 ml screw cap<br><br>
obtained by dissolving 2 mg of the dried sample in 50<br>
mM citrate buffer, pH 6.0 and then measuring the<br>
activity according to Example 30.<br>
The shelf stabilities of the various glucose<br>
oxidase formulations stored at 50 °C were determined.<br>
The data are presented in Figure 12. Lactitol was the<br>
most effective excipient at preserving glucose oxidase<br>
specific activity over time at elevated temperature.<br>
Table 10. Glucose Oxidase at 50°C<br><br>
The T1/2 was calculated from the shelf life<br>
data by non-linear regression analysis using the Sigma<br>
Plot program. Table 10 shows that formulations of<br>
glucose oxidase were 95 fold more stable than soluble<br>
when trehalose was used as the excipient. In addition,<br>
formulations of glucose oxidase were 121 fold more<br>
stable than soluble when lactitol was used as the<br>
excipient (Table 10). Formulations using HPCD or MOPEG<br>
as excipients with glucose oxidase crystals were 60 and<br>
325 fold more stable than soluble glucose oxidase,<br>
respectively(Table 10). Finally, formulations using<br>
gelatin or sucrose as excipients with glucose oxidase<br>
crystals were 99 and 82 fold more stable than soluble,<br>
respectively (Table 10).<br><br>
Formulations made with either trehalose,<br>
lactitol, HPCD, MOPEG, gelatin or sucrose, as<br>
excipients with glucose oxidase crystals were 2.5 fold,<br>
3.2 fold, 1.6 fold, 8.6 fold, 2.6 fold, or 2.2 fold<br>
more stable than glucose oxidase crystals made without<br>
an excipient at 50 °C, as measured by T1/2, as shown in<br>
Table 10.<br>

Crystallinity;<br>
The crystal integrity of the GOD formulations<br>
was measured by quantitative microscopic observations<br>
as described in Example 9. In this example, the<br>
crystals were readily visualized, indicating that<br>
crystallinity was maintained throughout the process.<br>
Figure 13 show that glucose oxidase crystals<br>
were readily visualized immediately after preparing the<br>
lactitol formulation. Figure 14 demonstrates that<br>
crystallinity was maintained after 13 days at 50 °C.<br>
Crystalline material was also readily visualized after<br><br>
formulating glucose oxidase with trehalose, as depicted<br>
in Figure 15. Likewise, crystalline material remained<br>
readily visualized after after 13 days at 50 °C, as<br>
shown in Figure 16.<br>
Secondary structure characterization by FTIR:<br>
Stability was assessed by quantifying the<br>
secondary stucture content of the dried and formulated<br>
GOD crystals by FTIR as described in Example 9. For<br>
comparison, a soluble glucose oxidase sample was<br>
prepared by dissolving glucose oxidase crystals in 50<br>
mM citrate buffer at pH 6.0 and placing about 1 ml on a<br>
Zinc selenide crystal of ARK ESP, which then analyzed<br>
for stability by FTIR.<br><br><br>
CONCLUSION:<br>
Soluble glucose oxidase lost 75% of its α-<br>
helical content within only 6 hours at 50 °C.<br>
The sugars lactitol, sucrose and trehalose<br>
were the most effective excipients in preventing loss<br>
of α-helical content upon storage at an elevated<br>
temperature. Glucose oxidase crystals formulated in<br><br>
lactitol, sucrose and trehalose and dried by method 4<br>
showed only an 18.1-19.4 % loss of α-helical structural<br>
content after 4 days at 50 °C.<br>

Producing DNA for Crystallization<br>
Plasmids derived from pUC plasmids, such as<br>
pSP64, may be used to produce either DNA or mRNA for<br>
crystallization. In this example, plasmid pSP64<br>
(available from Promega Biological Research Products)<br>
is used to generate DNA for crystallization. The cDNA<br>
coding for the protein of interest is inserted into any<br>
of a number restriction sites available in the multiple<br>
cloning site. The recombinant plasmid is then used to<br>
transform E. coli bacteria. Next, large amounts of<br>
plasmid are obtained by growth of the bacteria in<br>
ampicillin containing medium. The techniques for<br>
producing the recombinant plasmid, transforming E. coli<br>
cells and for bacterial growth and plasmid DNA<br>
preparation are described in detail in "Molecular<br>
Cloning, 2nd Edition" (1989) Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E.<br>
F. and T. Maniatis.<br><br>
Plasmid DNA is subsequently purified from the<br>
bacterial cultures by first lysing the cells and then<br>
separating the plasmid DNA from the genomic DNA, RNA<br>
and other cellular materials using CsCl gradients.<br>
These techniques are well known in the art and are<br>
discussed in detail in Sambrook et al. The gradient<br>
purified DNA is extracted with Tris-EDTA buffer<br>
saturated N-butanol and finally ethanol. Next, plasmid<br>
DNA is subjected to either linearization of the<br>
plasmid, for use in the generation of mRNA for RNA<br>
crystallization (Example 36) or excision of the gene of<br>
interest for DNA crystallization (Example 37).<br>
Example 36<br>
Producing mRNA for Crystallization<br>
The SP64 plasmid in combination with SP6 RNA<br>
Polymerase (available from Promega Biological Research<br>
Products) are used for the generation of milligram<br>
quantities of 5' capped RNA transcripts. The plasmid<br>
prepared in Example 35, prior to excision of the gene,<br>
is linearized with a restriction enzyme downstream of<br>
the poly A tail. The linear plasmid is purified by 2<br>
phenol/chloroform and 2 chloroform extractions. DNA is<br>
next precipitated with NaOAc (0.3M) and 2 volumes of<br>
EtOH. Next, the pellet is resuspended at approximately<br>
1 mg/ml in DEPC-treated distilled and deionized water.<br>
Transcription is carried out in a buffer<br>
composed of 400 mM Tris HCl (pH 8.0), 80 mM MgCl2, 50 mM<br>
DTT and 40 mM spermidine. The subsequent reagents are<br>
added in order to one volume of DEPC-treated water at<br>
room temperature: 1 volume SP6 RNA polymerase<br>
transcription buffer; rATP, rCTP and rUTP to 1 mM<br><br>
concentration; rGTP to 0.5 mM concentration;<br>
7meG(5')ppp(5')G cap analog (New England Biolabs,<br>
Beverly, Mass., 01951) to 0.5 mM concentration; the<br>
linearized DNA template prepared above to 0.5 mg/ml<br>
concentration; RNAs in (Promega, Madison, Wis.) to 2000<br>
U/ml concentration; and SP6 RNA polymerase (Promega,<br>
Madison, Wis.) to 3000 U/ml concentration. The<br>
transcription mixture is incubated for 1 hour at 37°c.<br>
The DNA template is then digested by adding 2<br>

used. The digestion reaction is carried out for 15<br>
minutes. The transcribed RNA is extracted twice with<br>
chloroform/phenol and twice with chloroform. The<br>
supernatant solution is precipitated with 0.3M NaOAc in<br>
2 volumes of EtOH and the pellet is resuspended in 100<br>
ml DEPC-treated deionized water per 500 ml<br>
transcription product. Finally, the supernatant<br>
solution is passed over an RNAse-free Sephadex G50<br>
column (Boehringer Mannheim # 100 411). The resultant<br>
mRNA is sufficiently pure to be used crystallization.<br>

ENCAPSULATED PROTEIN CRYSTALS<br>
Example 43<br>
Large Scale Crystallization of<br>
Pseudomonas cepacia Lipase<br>
A slurry of 15 kg crude Pseudomonas cepacia<br>
lipase (PS 30 lipase - Amano) ("LPS") was dissolved in<br>
100 L distilled deionized water and the volume brought<br>
to 200 L with additional distilled deionized water.<br>
The suspension was mixed in an Air Drive Lightning<br>
mixer for 2 hours at room temperature and then filtered<br>
through a 0.5 μm filter to remove celite. The mixture<br>
was then ultrafiltered and concentrated to 10 L (121.4<br>
g) using a 3K hollow fiber filter membrane cartridge.<br>
Solid calcium acetate was added to a concentration of<br>
20 mM Ca(CH3COO)2. The pH was adjusted to 5.5 with<br>
concentrated acetic acid, as necessary. The mixture<br>
was heated to and maintained at a temperature of 30°C.<br><br>
Magnesium sulfate was added to a 0.2 M concentration,<br>
followed by glucopon to a 1% concentration.<br>
Isopropanol was then added to a final concentration of<br>
23%. The resulting solution was mixed for 30 minutes<br>
at 30°C, then cooled from 30°C to 12°C over a 2 hour<br>
period. Crystallization was then allowed to proceed<br>
for 16 hours.<br>
The crystals were allowed to settle and<br>
soluble protein was removed using a peristaltic pump<br>
with tygon tubing having a 10 ml pipette at its end.<br>
Fresh crystallization solution (23% isopropyl alcohol,<br>
0.2 M MgSO4, 1% glucopon, 20 mM Ca(CH3COO)2, pH 5.5) was<br>
added to bring the concentration of protein to 30 mg/ml<br>
(O.D. 280 of a 1 mg/ml solution = 1.0, measured using a<br>
spectrophotometer at wavelength 280). The crystal<br>
yield was about 120 grams.<br>
Crosslinked LPS Crystals<br>
Crosslinked Pseudomonas cepacia lipase<br>
crystals, sold under the name ChiroCLEC-PC™, are<br>
available from Altus Biologics, Inc. (Cambridge,<br>
Massachusetts) were used to produce formulations<br>
according to Example 48. Alternatively, lipase<br>
crystals as prepared above may be crosslinked using any<br>
conventional method.<br>
Example 44<br>
Crosslinking of Glucose Oxidase Crystals<br>
We then crosslinked the glucose oxidase<br>
crystals prepared in Example 21 as follows. The<br>
crosslinking procedure involved glutaraldehyde, or<br><br>
glutaraldehyde pretreated with either Tris buffer (2-<br>
amino-2-hydroxymethyl-1,3-propanediol), lysine or<br>
diaminooctane.<br>
The crosslinking was performed using 60 mg of<br>
protein. Tris pretreated glutaraldehyde (48 mg Tris-<br>
base/g glutaraldehyde) was added to concentrations of<br>
0.2 and 0.6 g/g GO crystals suspended in 0.2 M sodium<br>
phosphate at pH 7.0. Reactions were allowed to proceed<br>
for two hours at room temperature. After two hours,<br>
the crystals were filtered and washed over glass fiber<br>
paper.<br>
The crosslinked crystals were encapsulated as<br>
described in Example 48. No differences were<br>
encountered in the encapsulation process between the<br>
variously crosslinked crystals. A representative<br>
sample is shown in Figure 21.<br>

Crosslinked Candida Rugosa Lipase Crystals<br>
Crosslinked Candida rugosa lipase crystals,<br>
sold under the name ChiroCLEC-CRTM, are available from<br>
Altus Biologics, Inc. (Cambridge, Massachusetts) and<br>
were used to produce formulations according to Example<br>
48. Alternatively, lipase crystals as prepared above,<br>
may be crosslinked using any conventional method.<br>
Example 4 6<br>
Crosslinking of Human Serum Albumin Crystals<br>
Crosslinking was performed on the human serum<br>
albumin crystals prepared in Example 10. The<br>
crosslinking reaction was performed at 4°C in a stirred<br><br>
solution of crystals in the mother liquor containing<br>
50% saturated ammonium sulfate. The crystals were not<br>
washed prior to crosslinking with borate-pretreated<br>
glutaraldehyde.<br>
Pretreated glutaraldehyde was prepared by<br>
adding one volume of 50% glutaraldehyde ("GA") to an<br>
equal volume of 300 mM sodium borate at pH 9. The<br>
glutaraldehyde solution was then incubated at 60°C for 1<br>
hour. The solution was cooled to room temperature and<br>
the pH was adjusted to 5.5 with concentrated HCl.<br>
Next, the solution was rapidly cooled on ice to 4°C.<br>
The pretreated glutaraldehyde (25%) was added<br>
to the crystallization solution in a stepwise fashion,<br>
using 0.05% increments (total concentration) at 15<br>
minute intervals to a concentration of 2%. Aliquots of<br>
the crystallization solution used ranged between 1 ml<br>
and 500 ml volume. The crystals were then brought to<br>
5% GA and incubated at 4°C for 4 hours to allow<br>
crosslinking. Finally, albumin crosslinked crystals<br>
were collected by low speed centrifugation and washed<br>
repeatedly with pH 7.5, 100 mM Tris HCl. Washing was<br>
stopped when the crosslinked crystals could be<br>
centrifuged at high speed without aggregation.<br>

Pretreated glutaraldehyde was prepared by the<br>
method of Example 46.<br>

using 0.05% increments (total concentration) at 15<br>
minute intervals to a concentration of 1.5%. Aliquots<br><br>
of the crystallization solution used ranged between 1<br>
ml and 500 ml volume. Finally, crosslinked crystals<br>
were collected by low speed centrifugation and washed<br>
repeatedly with pH 7.5, 100 mM Tris HCl. Washing was<br>
stopped when the crosslinked crystals could be<br>
centrifuged at high speed without aggregation.<br>
Example 4 8<br>
Microencapsulation of Protein Crystals in<br>
Polylactic-co-glvcolic acid (PLGA)<br>
A. Glycoproteins, Proteins, Enzymes<br>
Hormones, Antibodies and Peptides<br>
Microencapsulation was performed using<br>
uncrosslinked crystals of lipase from Candida rugosa<br>
and Psevdomonas cepacia, glucose oxidase from<br>
Aspergillus niger and Penicillin acylase from<br>
Escherichia coli. Further, microencapsulation was<br>
performed using crosslinked enzyme crystals of lipase<br>
from Candida rugosa, glucose oxidase from Aspergillus<br>
niger and Penicillin acylase from Escherichia coli.<br>
Table 13 shows the approximate average diameters of<br>
samples of the microspheres which were produced by this<br>
example. In addition, human serum albumin or any other<br>
protein crystals or protein crystal formulation<br>
produced may be encapsulated by this technique.<br><br><br><br>
B.	Preparation of Dry Crystals:<br>
Crystals or crystal formulations dried<br>
according to Example 6 may each be used to produce the<br>
microspheres of this invention. One process for dryinc<br>
protein crystals for use in this invention involves air<br>
drying.<br>
Approximately 500 mg each of Candida rugosa<br>
lipase crystals from Example 1 (uncrosslinked and<br>
crosslinked), glucose oxidase from Examples 21 and 44<br>
(uncrosslinked and crosslinked) and Penicillin acylase<br>
from Examples 14 and 47 (uncrosslinked and crosslinked)<br>
were air dried. First, the mother liquor was removed<br>
by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5 minutes. Next, the<br>
crystals were at 25°C in the fume hood for two days.<br>
C.	Polymer and Solvents<br>
The polymer used to encapsulate the protein<br>
crystals was PLGA. PLGA was purchased as 50/50<br>
Poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) from Birmingham Polymers,<br>
Inc. from Lot No. D97188. This lot had an inherent<br>
viscosity of 0.44 dl/g in HFIP@ 30°C.<br>
The methylene chloride was spectroscopic<br>
grade and was purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co.<br>
Milwaukee, WI. The poly vinyl alcohol was purchased<br>
from Aldrich Chemical Co. Milwaukee, WI.<br>
D.	Encapsulation of Crystals in PLGA:<br><br>
The crystals were encapsulated in PLGA using<br>
a double emulsion method. The general process was as<br>
follows, either dry protein crystals or a slurry of<br>
protein crystals was first added to a polymer solution<br>
in methylene chloride. The crystals were coated with<br>
the polymer and became nascent microspheres. Next, the<br>
polymer in organic solvent solution was transferred to<br>
a much larger volume of an aqueous solution containing<br>
a surface active agent. As a result, the organic<br>
solvent began to evaporate and the polymer hardened.<br>
In this example, two successive aqueous solutions of<br>
decreasing concentrations of emulsifier were employed<br>
for hardening of the polymer coat to form microspheres.<br>
The following procedure was one exemplification of this<br>
general process. Those of skill in the art of polymer<br>
science will appreciate that many variations of the<br>
procedure may be employed and the following example was<br>
not meant to limit the invention.<br>
1.0 Use of Dry Protein Crystals<br>
Dry crystals of crosslinked and uncrosslinked<br>
Candida rugosa lipase produced according to Example 1,<br>
crosslinked and uncrosslinked glucose oxidase produced<br>
according to Examples 21 and 45, crosslinked and<br>
uncrosslinked penicillin acylase produced according to<br>
Example 14 and 47, were weighed into 150 mg samples.<br>
The weighed protein crystals were then added directly<br>
into a 15 ml polypropylene centrifuge tube (Fisher<br>
Scientific) containing 2 ml of methylene chloride with<br>
PLGA at 0.6 g PLGA/ml solvent. The crystals were added<br>
directly to the surface of the solvent. Next, the tube<br>
was throughly mixed by vortexing for 2 minutes at room<br>
temperature to completely disperse the protein crystals<br>
in the solvent with PLGA. The crystals were allowed to<br><br>
become completely coated with polymer. Further<br>
vortexing or agitation may be used to keep the nascent<br>
microspheres suspended to allow further coating. The<br>
polymer may be hardened as described in section 3.0.<br>
2.0 Use of a Protein Crystal Slurry<br>
A crystal slurry of Pseudomonas cepacia<br>
lipase was produced using approximately 50 mg of<br>
crystals per 200 μl of mother liquor. The crystal<br>
slurry was rapidly injected into a 15 ml polypropylene<br>
centrifuge tube (Fisher Scientific) with 2 ml of a<br>
solution of methylene chloride and poly(lactic-co-<br>
glycolic acid) at 0.6 g PLGA/ml solvent. The needle<br>
was inserted below the surface of the solvent and<br>
injected into the solution. In this case, 150 mg of<br>
total protein, or 600 μl of aqueous solution, was<br>
injected. The injection was made using a plastic<br>
syringe Leur-lok (Becton-Dickinson &amp; Company) and<br>
through a 22 gauge (Becton-Dickinson &amp; Company)<br>
stainless steel needle. Next, the protein crystal-PLGA<br>
slurry was mixed thoroughly by vortexing for 2 minutes<br>
at room temperature. The crystals were allowed to be<br>
completely coated with polymer. Further vortexing or<br>
agitation was optionally used to keep the nascent<br>
microspheres suspended to allow further coating.<br>
3.0 Hardening the Polymer Coating<br>
A two step process was employed to facilitate<br>
the removal of methylene chloride from the liquid<br>
polymer coat and allow the polymer to harden onto the<br>
protein crystals. The difference between the steps is<br>
that the concentration of emulsifier was much higher in<br><br>
the first solution and the volume of the first solution<br>
is much smaller than the second.<br>
In the first step, the polymer coated crystal<br>
and methylene chloride suspension was added dropwise to<br>
a stirred flask of 180 ml of 6% polyvinyl alcohol<br>
(hereinafter "PVA") in water with 0.5% methylene<br>
chloride at room temperature. This solution was mixed<br>
rapidly for 1 minute.<br>
In step two, the first PVA solution<br>
containing the nascent microspheres was rapidly poured<br>
into 2.4 liters of cold (4°C) distilled water. This<br>
final bath was mixed gently at 4°C for 1 hr with the<br>
surface of the solution under nitrogen. After 1 hr,<br>
the microspheres were filtered using 0.22 μm filter and<br>
washed with 3 liters of distilled water containing 0.1%<br>
Tween 2 0 to reduce agglomeration.<br>
Example 49<br>
Production of Encapsulated Crystals<br>
Encapsulated microspheres of Pseudomonas<br>
cepacia lipase are prepared by phase separation<br>
techniques. The crystalline LPS prepared in Example 43<br>
is encapsulated in polylactic-co-glycolic acid ("PLGA")<br>
using a double emulsion method. A 700 mg aliquot of<br>
protein crystals is injected in methylene chloride<br>
containing PLGA (0.6 g PLGA/ml solvent; 10 ml). The<br>
mixture is homogenized for 30 sec at 3,000 rpm, using a<br>
homogenizer with a microfine tip. The resulting<br>
suspension is transferred to a stirred tank (900 ml)<br>
containing 6% poly (vinyl alcohol) ("PVA") and<br>
methylene chloride (4.5 ml). The solution is mixed at<br>
1,000 rpm for 1 min. The microspheres in the PVA<br><br>
solution are precipitated by immersion in distilled<br>
water, washed and filtered. The microspheres are then<br>
washed with distilled water containing 0.1% Tween, to<br>
reduce agglomeration and dried with nitrogen for 2 days<br>
at 4 °C.<br>
Example 50<br>
A. Protein Content of Microspheres<br>
The total protein content of the microspheres<br>
prepared in Example 48 was measured. Triplicate<br>
samples of 25 mg of the PLGA/PVA microspheres were<br>
incubated in 1 N sodium hydroxide with mixing for 4 8<br>
hrs. The protein content was then estimated using<br>
Bradford's method (M.M. Bradford, Analytical<br>
Biochemistry, vol. 72, page 248-254 (1976)) and a<br>
commercially available kit from BioRad Laboratories<br>
(Hercules, CA). The protein containing microspheres<br>
were compared to PLGA microspheres without any crystals<br>
and is shown in Table 14.<br>
Table 14. Protein Content of Microspheres<br><br><br>
The activity per milligram or specific<br>
activity of selected samples from Table 14 was<br>
determined and is shown in Table 15.<br>
Table 15. Specific Activity<br><br>
Example 51<br>
Protein Release from Microspheres<br>
The release of protein from the PLGA<br>
microspheres prepared in Example 4 8 was measured by<br>
placing 50 mg of protein encapsulated PLGA microspheres<br>
in microcentrifuge filtration tubes containing 0.22 μm<br>
filters. Next, 600 μl of release buffer (phosphate<br>
buffered saline with 0.02% Tween 20 at pH 7.4) was<br>
added to the microspheres on the retentate side of the<br>
filter. The tubes were incubated at 37°C to allow<br>
dissolution. To measure the amount of protein released<br>
with time, samples were taken at different time<br>
intervals. The tube was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 1<br>
minute and the filtrate was removed for protein<br><br>
activity and total protein measurements. The<br>
microspheres were then resuspended with another 600 μl<br>
of release buffer.<br>
A. Total Protein Released From Microspheres<br>
Table 16 shows that almost 90% of the input<br>
protein was recovered in all cases. In addition, the<br>
percentage of total Pseudomonas cepacia lipase released<br>
from the microencapsulated protein crystals was<br>
relatively constant for approximately 5.7 days or until<br>
more than 80% of the input protein had been released at<br>
a rate of 15.8%/day. This long rapid release was<br>
followed by eight days with a only 0.6% release per<br>
day.<br>
In contrast, Table 16 further shows that<br>
Candida rugosa lipase crystals displayed the opposite<br>
profile, displaying first a slow release which was<br>
followed by a rapid release phase. In the first three<br>
days, about 10% of the protein was released with a<br>
shallow slope of 2.4%/day. From day 4 to day 14,<br>
another 80% of the protein was released in a linear<br>
fashion and a slope of 7.5%/day. The release profiles<br>
shown in Table 16 were obtained at 37°C and at pH 7.4.<br>
These data illustrate that the encapsulated<br>
proteins of this invention are suitable for biological<br>
delivery of therapeutic proteins. Various rates of<br>
delivery can be selected by manipulating the choice of<br>
protein crystal, size of the crystals, crosslinking of<br>
the crystals, the hydrophobic and hydrophilic<br>
characteristics of the encapsulating polymer, the<br>
number of encapsulations, dose of microspheres and<br>
other easily controllable variables.<br><br><br>
Table 16. Protein Release From Microspheres<br>
B. Protein Activity Released From<br>
Microspheres<br>
The biological activity of the protein<br>
released with time was measured using the olive oil<br>
assay for lipase microspheres. These results are shown<br>
in Table 17.<br>
The biological activity of the released<br>
protein, as shown in Table 17, demonstrates that the<br>
microspheres protect and release active protein. The<br>
cumulative percent activity released, calculated based<br>
on the amount of input protein, was closely correlated<br><br>
with the total protein released (compare Table 16 and<br>
Table 17). The two different crystal lipases released<br>
essentially 100% active protein. Even after 7 days of<br>
immersion at 37°C, the protein that was released from<br>
the microspheres was fully active.<br>

The activity measurements set forth above<br>
were made using the olive oil assay described in<br>
Example 8.<br>

Microscopic Examination of PLGA Microspheres<br>
In order to visualize whether the crystals<br>
were intact after encapsulation, PLGA microspheres<br>
prepared according to Example 48 were examined under an<br>
Olympus BX60 microscope equipped with DXC-970MD 3CCD<br>
Color Video Camera with Camera Adapter (CMA D2) with<br><br>
Image ProPlus software. Samples of dry microspheres<br>
were covered with a glass coverslip, mounted and<br>
examined under 10X magnification, using an Olympus<br>
microscope with an Olympus UPLAN F1 objective lens<br>
10X/0.30 PH1 (phase contrast), the crystals were<br>
readily visualized and the crystal size determined.<br>
Microsphere and crystal sizes were determined using<br>
Image Pro Software from Olympus and 0.5-150 μm. sizing<br>
beads provided by the manufacturer. The size of the<br>
outer PLGA microspheres was determined, as well as for<br>
the crystals.<br>

Protein Release<br>
The release of proteins from the PLGA<br>
microspheres is measured by placing 50 mg of PLGA<br>
microspheres in micro-centrifuge filtration tubes<br>
containing 0.22 µm filters. A 600 µl aliquot of<br>
release buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 0.02%<br>
Tween, 0.02% azide) is added to suspend the<br>
microspheres on the retentate side of the filter. The<br>
tubes are sealed with 3 cc vial stoppers and covered by<br>
parafilm. The microspheres are then incubated at 37°C.<br><br>
Samples are taken over time by centrifugation (13,000<br>
rpm, 1 min) of the tubes. The filtrate is removed and<br>
the microspheres are resuspended with 600 μl of the<br>
release buffer. The quality of the released protein is<br>
assayed by SEC-HPLC and enzymatic activity.<br>
The shape and size of the protein crystals<br>
may be chosen to adjust the rate of dissolution or<br>
other properties of the protein crystal formulations of<br>
this invention.<br>
Example 54<br>
Encapsulation of Lipase Crystals Using a<br>
Biological Polymer<br>
Biological polymers are also useful for<br>
encapsulating protein crystals. The present example<br>
demonstrates encapsulation of crosslinked and<br>
uncrosslinked crystals of Candida rugosa lipase<br>
crystals. The uncrosslinked and crosslinked crystals<br>
were prepared as described in Example 1 and 45.<br>
Antibodies and chemicals were purchased from Sigma.<br>
1•0 Preparation of coated crystals<br>
A solution of 1.5 ml of bovine serum albumin<br>
("BSA") at 10 mg/ml was prepared, in 5 mM phosphate<br>
buffer adjusted to pH 7. Next, 15 ml of a 10 mg/ml<br>
suspension of Candida rugosa lipase crystals was<br>
prepared in 5 mM K/Na phosphate buffer, 1 M NaCl, at pH<br>
7 ("buffer"). The BSA solution was added to the<br>
crystal solution and the two solutions were mixed<br>
thoroughly. The crystals were incubated in the BSA for<br>
30 min with slow mixing using an orbital shaker.<br>
Following the incubation with BSA, the crystals were <br><br>
dryed overnight by vacuum filtration. The dryed<br>
crystals were resuspended in buffer without albumin.<br>
The crystals were washed with buffer until no protein<br>
could be detected in the wash as measured by absorbance<br>
at280nm or until the A280nm was 
were recovered by low speed centrifugation.<br>
2.0 Detection of the Albumin Coat<br>
The coated crystals were evaluated by Western<br>
blotting to confirm the presence of the albumin layer<br>
Following washing, coated protein crystals were<br>
incubated in 100 mM NaOH overnight to dissolve the<br>
microspheres into the constituent proteins. The<br>
samples were neutralized, filtered and analyzed by<br>
SDS-PAGE immunoblot according to Sambrook et al.<br>
"Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual", Cold Spring<br>
Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York<br>
(1989).<br>
The results of SDS-PAGE immunoblot of both<br>
albumin coated crosslinked and uncrosslinked crystal<br>
microspheres of Candida rugosa lipase revealed a single<br>
immunoreactive species having the same molecular weight<br>
as albumin.<br>
Samples of the albumin coated crosslinked and<br>
uncrosslinked crystal microspheres of Candida rugosa<br>
lipase were incubated with a fluorescene-labeled<br>
anti-BSA antibodies which specifically recognize and<br>
bind to bovine serum albumin. Next, excess antibody<br>
was removed thorough washing with phosphate buffer.<br>
Microscopic examination of these fluorescently labeled<br>
albumin coated crystal microspheres under a fluorscent<br>
microscope revealed specific fluorescene-labeling of<br>
the microspheres. Uncoated lipase crystals were used<br><br>
as control and these showed no specific binding of the<br>
antibody.<br>
