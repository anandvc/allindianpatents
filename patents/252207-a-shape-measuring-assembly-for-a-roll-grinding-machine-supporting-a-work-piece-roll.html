SHAPE-MEASURING ASSEMBLY FOR A GRINDING MACHINE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001]    This invention relates generally to the field of roll or cylinder grinding machines and,<br>
more particularly, to a measuring assembly or caliper assembly utilized to measure the geometry<br>
or configuration of rolls or cylinders received on grinding machines.<br>
Description of Related Art<br>
[0002] Rolling mills in the steel, aluminum and paper industries commonly use metal rolls in<br>
shaping products, such as a piece or sheet of metal, aluminum foil, or sheet of paper. The rolls<br>
may have a surface cover of a material other than metal, such as rubber, polyurethane or ceramic.<br>
Use in the mill eventually leads to a degradation of shape and quality of the roll surface, at which<br>
point one must take the roll out of the mill for refinishing on a grinding machine, U.S. Patent<br>
No, 4,811,524 to Corallo describes a grinding machine,<br>
[0003] U.S. Patent No, 6,159,074 to Kube et al. describes a caliper assembly for a grinding<br>
machine. This caliper has two measuring arms used to measure the diameter of the roll in the<br>
grinding machine. A series of consecutive diameter measurements along the length of the roll<br>
provides the roll profile.<br>
[0004] A common problem with roll grinding stems from inaccuracies in the mechanical<br>
support of the roll which induce extraneous error movements of the roll as the roll turns.<br>
Without compensation in the grinding process, these error movements may contribute to<br>
roundness or shape errors in the finished roll.<br>
[0005] A two-point measurement cannot reliably distinguish roundness or shape errors from<br>
error movements of the roll.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006] Briefly, according to the present invention, there is provided a shape-measuring<br>
assembly for a roll grinding machine capable of supporting a workpiece roll in at least two<br>
spaced bearings defining the axis of the roll. The assembly is configured for measuring the<br>
shape of the generally cylindrical surface of the roll mounted in the bearings. The measuring<br>
assembly comprises a movable support frame spaced from the roll axis and movable parallel to<br>
the roll axis over a referenoe plane, such as the floor, parallel to the roil axis. An arm carriage is<br>
supported within the support frame for movement toward and away from the reference plane. A<br><br>
WO 2006/084072	PCT/US2006/003742<br>
2<br>
first arm is supported from the arm carriage extending away from the frame. The first arm<br>
extends over the roll axis. A fixed sensor probe is mounted near the distal end of the first arm<br>
for sensing the position of the surface of the roll. A first rail is mounted in the first arm, forming<br>
a first angle with the reference plane. A first positionable sensor carriage is mounted to be<br>
guided along the first rail. A first sensor probe is mounted to the first sensor carnage for sensing<br>
the position of the surface of the roll. The first sensor carnage and the first arm carriage are<br>
interconnected such that as the first aim is moved by the arm carriage toward the roll axis, the<br>
first sensor carnage is moved in a first path toward the roll axis.<br>
[0007] Preferably, a second rail is mounted in the first arm, forming a second and different<br>
angle with the reference plane. A second positionable sensor carriage is mounted to be guided<br>
along the second rail. A second sensor probe is mounted to the second sensor carriage for<br>
sensing the position of the surface of the roll and the arm. The second sensor carriage and the<br>
arm carriage are interconnected such that as the arm is moved by the arm carriage toward the roll<br>
axis, the second sensor carriage is moved in a second path toward the roll axis.<br>
[0008] Most preferably, the first and second sensor carriages have different ranges of travel<br>
relative to the surface of the roll,<br>
[0009] It is an advantage, according to the present invention, that the first fixed, first<br>
positionable and second positionable sensor probes can determine the position of three points on<br>
the surface of the roll, thus defining a circle on the surface of the roll including the location of<br>
the center of the circle and the diameter of the circle.<br>
[0010] According to a preferred embodiment, a second arm is supported from a second arm<br>
carriage extending away from the frame. The second arm extends under the roll axis. A second<br>
fixed sensor probe is mounted near the distal end of the second arm for sensing the position of<br>
the surface of the roil. It is an advantage of this embodiment that at least three of the first fixed,<br>
second fixed, first positionable and second positionable sensor probes can determine the position<br>
of at least three points on the surface of the roll, thus defining a circle on the surface of the roll<br>
including the location of the center of the circle and the diameter of the circle.<br>
[0011] According to one embodiment, the sensor carriage and the arm carriage are<br>
interconnected by a gear rack fixed to the frame and a pinion engaging the gear rack carried by<br>
an axle journaled relative to the arm and arm carriage. A reduction gear and driving sprocket<br><br>
WO 2006/084072	PCT/US2006/003742<br>
3<br>
secured to an axle are arranged for driving a chain or grooved belt over the sprocket and a spaced<br>
idler sprocket The chain or grooved belt is connected to the sensor carriage,<br>
[0012]    It is most preferred, according to the present invention, that the sensor carriage and the<br>
arm carriage are interconnected so that the carriages move toward the roll along a radial path<br>
extending from the roll axis. In one embodiment, gears and sprockets are sized so that a unit<br>
movement of the first arm downward toward the roll results in a movement of the sensor carriage<br>
along the rail which is approximately the unit movement divided by the sine of the angle the<br>
track makes with the reference plane.<br>
[0013]    Preferably, sensor probes have a probe bearing fixed to a pivot arm pivoted to a sensor<br>
carriage and a length gauge bears on the side of the pivot arm opposite the probe bearing. The<br>
length gauge is generally in line with a radial line extending from the roll axis.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0020] The present invention comprises a shape-measuring assembly for a grinding machine<br>
for grinding a roll The grinding machine includes a support to receive the roll so that the roll<br>
can turn around its longitudinal axis and a grinding wheel that can grind the surface around the<br>
circumference of the roll. An infeed mechanism brings the grinding wheel in contact with the<br>
roll and a traverse mechanism moves the grinding wheel parallel to the longitudinal axis between<br>
opposite ends of the roll.<br><br>
WO 2006/084072	PCT/US2006/003742<br>
4<br>
[0021] A shape-measuring assembly or caliper assembly is configured to measure the shape of<br>
the roll and has mechanisms to place it in contact with the roll surface and to move it between<br>
opposite ends of the roll. The assembly includes a frame and a carnage supported by a linear<br>
guide connected to the frame. One or two measuring arms are connected to the linear guide in<br>
spaced relation. The linear guide is configured to enable each measuring arm to move relative to<br>
the frame and parallel to the longitudinal axis of the linear guide. A linear motor is connected<br>
between the frame and the pair of measuring arms. The linear motor is configured to supply to<br>
the pair of measuring arms a motive force which moves the pair of measuring arms parallel to<br>
the longitudinal axis of the linear guide.<br>
[0022] One of the measuring arms incorporates a single displaceable sensor. The second<br>
measuring arm incorporates three displaceable sensors, one of which is diametrically opposed to<br>
the sensor in the first arm so as to allow a direct diameter measurement of the roll when both<br>
arms are brought into contact with the roll. The remaining two sensors are mounted at different<br>
angles on linear slides or carriages fixed to the measuring arm. The sensors on the slides are<br>
linked to the caliper frame in such a way that when the measuring arms move relative to the<br>
frame, the sensors move relative to the measuring arms while retaining their angular orientation.<br>
As the arms move in toward the roll, all sensors move along straight lines which intersect at the<br>
center of the roll. The three sensors on the one arm provide the minimum measurement data<br>
required to calculate the cross-sectional shape of the roll and the error movement of the roll. For<br>
better accuracy, one may use the data from four displaceable sensors in the calculation of roll<br>
shape and error movement. One may also use only the arm with the three sensors for, in addition<br>
to the calculation of roll shape and movement, a calculation of the diameter of the roll. The<br>
present invention, therefore, also applies to an assembly configured with a single measuring arm<br>
with at least three displaceable sensors or measuring point contacts.<br>
[0023] The present invention may include an automatic control system that processes the data<br>
from the multiple sensors and calculates the shape of the roll and the error movement of the roll.<br>
This is possible since three points on the circumference of a circle enable determination of the<br>
position of the center of the circle and, thus, the radius. The control system can superimpose a<br>
correction onto the infeed movement of the grinding wheel so as to reduce or eliminate the<br>
roundness or shape error that would result from the error movement of the roll in the grinding<br>
machine.   The control system can use the same correction process to grind the roll to a<br><br>
WO 2006/084072	PCT/US2006/003742<br>
5     <br>
predetermined out-of-round shape, such as shapes that counteract or compensate for anticipated<br>
dynamic deformation of the roll during its subsequent use at mill temperatures and operating<br>
speeds.<br>
[0024] The present invention makes it possible to measure the error movement of the roll as it<br>
turns in the grinding machine. Furthermore, the position and orientation of the measuring<br>
assembly make it possible to perform the measurements not only before and after grinding but<br>
also during grinding. An automatic control system can then apply shape corrections during fee<br>
grinding process to compensate for the error movement of the roll and grind the roll round even<br>
though it may not turn round in the grinding machine,<br>
[0025] With reference to Figs, 1 and 2, the preferred embodiment of the shape-measuring or<br>
caliper assembly for a grinding machine includes one measuring arm with multiple displaceable<br>
probes and a synchronous transport mechanism. A measuring arm body 1 is connected to a<br>
mounting base or carriage 2 which is itself movably coupled to a caliper support frame 3 via an<br>
elongated linear guide 4. A gear raok 5 is fixedly attached to the front face of the caliper support<br>
frame 3. A primary drive pinion 6, rotatably attached to Side 1 (Fig. 1) of the arm body 1,<br>
engages the gear rack 5.<br>
[0026] The primary drive pinion 6 also meshes with a primary reduction gear 7, which rotates<br>
about the primary drive axis 8. A primary transport sprocket 9 is coaxially and fixedly coupled<br>
to the primary reduction gear 7 and rotates in unison with the primary reduction gear 7 about the<br>
primary drive axis 8. A non-continuous, primary transport toothed belt 10 is wrapped around the<br>
primary transport sprocket 9 and a primary idler sprocket 11. The primary idler sprocket 11 is<br>
rotatably attached to the arm body 1 on an axis parallel to the primary drive axis 8 and near the<br>
far (distal) end of a primary linear guide rail 12. The primary linear guide rail 12 is fixedly<br>
attached to the arm body 1 and centrally located between the primary transport sprocket 9 and<br>
the primary idler sprocket 11, its axial centerline being parallel to or coplanar with a plane<br>
intersecting the primary drive axis 8 and the axis of the primary idler sprocket 11. A tertiary<br>
probe body 13 is fixedly attached to a primary linear bearing 14 which is itself movably coupled<br>
to the primary linear guide rail 12. Both ends of the primary transport toothed belt 10 are<br>
attaohed to the tertiary probe body 13 by means of screw clamps.<br>
[0027] On Side 2 (Fig. 2) of the arm body 1, a secondary drive sprocket 15 is coaxially and<br>
rotatably coupled to the opposite end of a common drive axle 16 and rotates in unison with the<br><br>
WO 2006/084072	PCT/US2006/003742<br>
6<br>
primary reduction gear 7 and the primary transport sprocket 9. A secondary drive axle 17 is<br>
fixedly attached to the arm body 1 at a set distance from and parallel to the common drive axle<br>
16, A secondary reduction sprocket 18 and a secondary transport sprocket 19 are coaxially and<br>
rotatably coupled and fixed to the secondary drive axle 17 so that they rotate in unison about a<br>
secondary drive axis 20. A continuous, secondary drive toothed belt 21 wraps around the<br>
secondary drive sprocket 15 and the secondary reduction sprocket 18. A secondary idler<br>
sprocket 22 is rotatably attached to the arm body 1 on an axis parallel to a secondary linear guide<br>
rail 23. The secondary linear guide rail 23 is fixedly attached to the arm body 1 and centrally<br>
located between the secondary transport sprocket 19 and the secondary idler sprocket 22, its<br>
axial centerline parallel to or coplanar with a plane intersecting the secondary drive axis 20 and<br>
the aids of the secondary idler sprocket 22. A non-continuous, secondary transport toothed belt<br>
26 wraps around the secondary transport sprocket 19 and the secondary idler sprocket 22. A<br>
secondary probe 28 has a secondary probe body 24 is fixedly attached to a secondary linear<br>
bearing 25 which is itself movably coupled to the secondary linear guide rail 23. Both ends of<br>
the secondary transport toothed belt 26 are attached to the secondary probe body 24 by means of<br>
screw clamps,<br>
[0028] The primary, secondary and tertiary probe components are very similar and like<br>
components are identified with a common numeral in the drawings.<br>
[0029] A machined cavity in Side 1 (Fig, 1 and Fig. 3) at the small end of the arm body 1<br>
houses the components comprising the primary displacement probe 27. The main components of<br>
the primary (Fig. 3), secondary (Fig. 4) and tertiary (Fig. 5) displacement probes are a probe<br>
pivot axle 30 fixedly attached perpendicular to the arm body 1. A probe pivot bearing 31 is<br>
rotatably attached to the probe pivot axle 30 and fixedly attached to a probe pivot arm 32, such<br>
that the probe pivot arm 32 and the outer bearing race of the probe pivot bearing 31 rotate in<br>
unison about the probe pivot axle 30, A probe contact tip 33 is provided at the other end of the<br>
probe pivot arm 32 which contacts the outside diameter of a revolving cylindrical workpiece,<br>
following its surface contour. The longitudinal axis and centerline of the cylindrical workpiece<br>
or rod is fixed in the grinding machine and oriented perpendicular to the caliper's vertical<br>
measuring plane (the plane which intersects all of the caliper's probe contact tips 33) and passes<br>
through the point on that plane where the caliper's probe centerlines 43 intersect. On the face of<br>
the probe pivot arm 32 opposite the probe contact tip 33? a precision-ground rest button 34 is<br><br>
WO 2006/084072	PCT/US2006/003742<br>
7<br>
fixedly attached, providing a proof surface for the contact tip of a high-resolution length gauge<br>
36, which registers a motion component directly proportional to the radial displacements<br>
produced by the outside diameter surface contour of the cylindrical workpiece as it revolves past<br>
the probe contact tip 33, thus lifting or dropping the free end of the probe pivot arm 32, i.e,, the<br>
end opposite the probe pivot axle 30. The cylindrical barrel of the high-resolution length gauge<br>
36 is adjustably secured inside the probe cavity of the arm body 1 by means of a clamp yoke 37,<br>
An adjustable mechanical stop 38 is provided to limit the travel of the free end of the probe pivot<br>
arm 32. An adjustable over-travel limit switch 39 is fixed in the probe cavity wall of the arm<br>
body 1. A load spring 40 is installed coaxially onto the front of the over-travel limit switch 39,<br>
applying a small force moment to the probe pivot arm 32 about the probe pivot axle 30. The<br>
over-travel limit switch 39 is tripped when contact pressure from a spring rate adjuster screw 41<br>
displaces the over-travel limit switch 39 plunger sufficiently to trip the contacts inside the<br>
switch. The over-travel switch 39 and the mechanical stop 38 prevent excessive travel beyond<br>
the rated limits of the high-resolution length gauge 36, To prevent contact point bounce and<br>
separation between the rest button 34 and the high-resolution length gauge 36, a motion damper<br>
is fixedly mounted between an internal wall inside the primary probe cavity of the arm body 1<br>
and the face of the probe pivot arm 32. A rubber boot seal 35 is fixedly attached by retainer<br>
bushing 44 at two locations in each of the three probe configurations-primary (27, Fig, 3),<br>
secondary (28, Fig. 4) and tertiary (29, Fig. 5). One end of the first rubber boot seal 35 is fixedly<br>
attached to the outside face of the primary probe cavity wall in the arm body 1 and the other end<br>
is pinned between the underside of the rest button 34 and the mating face of the probe pivot arm<br>
32. The second rubber boot seal 35' is likewise fixed to the outside face of the primary probe<br>
cavity wall in the arm body 1 and the other end is pinned between the underside of the boot seal<br>
retainer bushing 44 and the mating face of the probe pivot arm 32.   Functionally identical<br>
secondary (28, Fig. 4) and tertiary (29, Fig. 5) displacement probe components are likewise<br>
housed inside the secondary probe body 24 and the tertiary probe body 13, respectively.  A<br>
motion damper 42 damps oscillations of the probe pivot arm 32,<br>
[0030] The preferred embodiment of the present invention as described herein accomplishes<br>
the synchronous motion of the three displacement probes so that as the caliper arms approach<br>
any cylindrical workpiece within the diametric measurement range, each of the three probes are<br>
at all times aligned at fixed and optimum angles with respect to the other two probes (see Fig. 6).<br><br>
WO 2006/084072	PCT/US2006/003742<br>
8<br>
As the probe bodies converge to address a workpiece, the contact tips of the probes each travel<br>
along a distinct line of action passing through the workpiece center at their optimum and<br>
characteristic angles. The synchronous transport mechanism described herein uses only the<br>
linear motor housed in the caliper frame as the source of motive power. Fig. 6 also shows<br>
another measuring arm '50 including a single displaceable sensor 52. The contact tip 33 in the<br>
primary-probe 27 in the arm body 1 including the three displaceable sensors is diametrically<br>
opposed to a contact tip 54 in the displaceable sensor 52 in the other measuring arm 50.<br>
[0031] Having thus defined the invention in the detail and particularity required by the Patent<br>
Laws, what is desired protected by Letters Patent is set forth in the following claims.<br><br>
