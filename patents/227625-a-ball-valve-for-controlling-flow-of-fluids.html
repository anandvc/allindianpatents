				<td>Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates, in general, to ball valves to control flows of fluids<br>
and, more particularly, to a ball valve which has two symmetric valve casings each<br>
having a stricture possible to be manufactured through a thermal compression molding<br>
process, so that a ball is received in the two valve casings, thus casing an inspection of<br>
the ball, and increasing the water lightness of the ball valve.<br>
Background Art<br>
Generally, ball valves have short switching times, low torques to drive the ball<br>
valves, and watertight structures. Therefore, the conventional ball valves arc typically<br>
used to control flows of fluids. As shown in FIG. 1, a first conventional ball valve<br>
includes asymmetric first and second valve casings 10 and 20. A ball scat 11 is<br>
provided in the second valve casing 20. A ball 30 is scaled in the ball seat 11.<br>
A lever receiving hole 13 is provided on the second valve casing 20. A control<br>
lever 40 is inserted into the lever receiving hole 13 to be integrally coupled to (he ball<br>
30. The first conventional ball valve having the above-mentioned stricture is<br>
interposed between two pipes to couple the two pipes to each other, thus controlling a<br>
flow of a fluid passing through the (wo pipes. When the control lever 40 is positioned<br>
in a same direction as (he longitudinal directions of the two pipes, the ball valve is<br>
opened. When the control lever 40 is positioned in a direction perpendicular to the two<br>
pipes, the ball valve is closed.<br>
However, in (he first conventional ball valve, as shown in FIG. 1, shapes of (he<br>
first and second valve casings 10 and 20 to receive therein (he ball 30 are<br>
asymmetrical. Each of the first and second valve casings 10 and 20 is very complex in<br>
its construction. Therefore, it is impossible to manufacture the first conventional ball<br>
valve through an injection molding process. Only, the first conventional ball valve<br>
must be manufactured through a casting or culling process. Thus, the first conventional<br>
ball valve increases the production costs thereof. Furthermore, a material of the first<br>
conventional ball valve is limited.<br>
In the first conventional ball valve, in case that an error of the ball 30 is generated<br>
or an if spection of the ball 30 is necessary, a plurality of bolts must be loosened from<br>
the first and second valve casings 10 and 20. The first and second valve casings 10 and<br>
20 arc thereafter separated from each other. Thereafter, the control lever 40, which has<br><br>
been coupled to the hall 30 through the lever receiving hole 13, is removed from the<br>
second valve casing 20 having therein the hall 30. The ball 30 is, thereafter, removed<br>
from the second valve easing 20 to he inspected. As such, (he first conventional ball<br>
valve is problematic in that a lengthy time is required lo inspect the ball 30 due to the<br>
complicated disassembling process.<br>
In an effort to overcome the problems experienced in the first conventional ball<br>
valve with the asymmetric first and second valve casings 10 and 20, a second con-<br>
ventional ball valve, which is made of a synthetic resin through an injection molding<br>
process, as shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, was proposed. Referring lo FIGS. 2 and 3, Ihe<br>
second conventional ball valve includes first and second valve casings 50 and 60<br>
which have symmetric structures and each are manufactured through an injection<br>
molding process, and an intermediate casing 70 which is manufactured through an<br>
additional injection molding process. The second conventional ball valve further<br>
includes a ball 80 which is seated in the intermediate casing 70, and a lever receiving<br>
part 71 which is provided on a predetermined portion of the intermediate casing 70. A<br>
control lever 90 is inserted into the lever receiving part 71 and is coupled to the ball<br>
80. A first ring 91 is seated in a ring-shaped groove which is provided on a pre-<br>
determined portion of the control lever 90.<br>
An external thread is provided on an outer surface of the lever receiving part 71.<br>
The second conventional ball valve further includes a cap 92 which has on an inner<br>
surface thereof an internal thread. The cap 92 is threadedly fastened to the lever<br>
receiving part 71, thus preventing the control lever 90 from being undesirably<br>
removed.<br>
The first and second valve casings 50 and 60 are coupled to the intermediate casing<br>
70, with second and third rings 51 and 61 respectively interposed in junctions between<br>
the first and second valve casings 50 and 60 and the intermediate casing 70. At this<br>
time, the first and second valve casings 50 and 60 arc coupled lo the intermediate<br>
casing 70 by a plurality of longitudinal coupling bolls 72.<br>
However, because the second conventional ball valve includes the three body parts<br>
which comprises the first and second valve casings 50 and 60 and the intermediate<br>
casing 70, the number of processes and a time required lo manufacture (he second con-<br>
ventional ball valve are increased. Furthermore, lo couple or disassemble the second<br>
conventional ball valve having the three body parts, the second conventional ball valve<br>
forces a user to spend a length)' working time and a great manual force. To seal the<br>
junctions between the three body parts and the control lever 90, the first, second and<br><br>
third rings 51, 01 and 91 must be respectively provided in the junctions. Even though<br>
the first and second rings 51 and 61 arc respectively provided in the junctions between<br>
the three body parts, the water lightness of the junctions between the three body parts<br>
must be reduced while the three body parts arc coupled to each other by the plurality of<br>
longitudinal coupling bolls 72.<br>
In addition, to maintain a coupled state between the control lever 90 and the ball<br>
80, the cap 92 is threadedly tightened to the lever receiving part 71. The lightening of<br>
the cap 92 lo the lever receiving pan 71 causes a defect in that the cap 92 and even the<br>
control lever 90 may be undesirably removed from the intermediate casing 70 due to<br>
wear of the thread of the cap 92 or the lever receiving part 71. To remove the ball 80<br>
from the intermediate casing 70 for an inspection of the ball 80, one of the first and<br>
second valve casings 50 and 60 is separated from the intermediate casing 70. The cap<br>
92 and the control lever 90 must be further separated from the intermediate casing 70,<br>
so that the structure of the second conventional ball valve having the three body parts<br>
causes inconvenience to a user.<br>

Referring to FIGS. 4 through 6, the ball valve of the present invention is made of a<br>
molten glass-fiber reinforced plastic (PRP) of a high acid resistance or a molten ther-<br>
mosetting resin (SMC : sheet molding compound) through a thermal compression<br>
molding process. The special feature of the present invention resides in that the ball<br>
valve comprises symmetric first and second valve casings 100 and 200.<br>
The first and second valve casings 100 and 200 include symmetric first and second<br>
lever receiving parts 110 and 210 which are provided on predetermined portions of the<br>
first and second valve casings 100 and 200, respectively. A control lever 300 is<br>

second valve casings 100 and 200 further include symmetric first and second ball seals<br>
120 and 220, respectively, so that a ball 400 is sealed in both the first and second ball<br>
scats 120 and 220. The first and second valve casings 100 and 200 further include first<br>
and second coupling flanges 130 and 230 which arc provided around the first and<br>
second ball scats 120 and 220, respectively. A plurality of first and second coupling<br>
holes 131 and 231 are respectively provided on the first and second coupling flanges<br>
130 and 230, so that the first and second valve casings 100 and 200 are coupled to each<br>
other by a plurality of coupling bolts.<br>
First and second stoppers 111 and 211 are respectively provided on ends of the first<br>
and second lever receiving parts 110 and 210. A stop projection 310 is provided on a<br>
predetermined portion of the control lever 300 to engage with the first and second<br>
stoppers 111 and 211, thus preventing the control lever 300 from undesirably removed<br>
from the ball valve.<br>
The ball valve of the present invention further comprises a ring unit 500 which is<br>
provided in the junction of the first and second valve casings 100 and 200 to obtain the<br>
water tightness of the ball valve. First and second ring-shaped grooves 132 and 232<br>
each hav ing a semicircular cross-section arc provided along bolh the first and second<br>
coupling flanges 130 and 230 and the first and second lever receiving parts 110 and<br>
210, respectively. The ring unit 500 is seated in the first and second ring-shaped<br><br>
grooves 132 and 232.<br>
The ring unit 500, different from typical rings, comprises a first ring part 510<br>
which is scaled in parts of both the first and second ring-shaped grooves 132 and 232,<br>
provided on the first and second coupling flanges 130 and 230. The ring unit 500<br>
further comprises a second ring part 520 which is integrally coupled to the first ring<br>
part 510 to be perpendicular to the first ring pan 510 and is seated in parts of both the<br>
first and second ring-shaped grooves 132 and 232, provided on the first and second<br>
lever receiving parts 110 and 210.<br>
After the first and second valve casings 100 and 200, the ball 400 and the conlrol<br>
lever 300 are assembled into a single body, a cap 600 is fastened to both the first and<br>
second lever receiving parts 110 and 210. Preferably, an external thread is provided on<br>
an outer surface of each of the first and second lever receiving parts 110 and 210. An<br>
internal thread is provided on an inner surface of the cap 600, so that the internal<br>
thread of the cap 600 engages with the outer threads of the first and second lever<br>
receiving parts 110 and 210.<br>
Furthermore, the ball valve of the present invention further includes a packing<br>
support unit 800 which is provided around an inner end of each of first and second<br>
through holes 140 and 240 of the first and second valve casings 100 and 200. The ball<br>
valve further includes a packing 700 which is provided between the packing support<br>
unit 800 and each of the inner ends of the first and second through holes 140 and 240.<br>
Due to the packings 700 and the packing support units 800, even when the ball 400 is<br>
rotated in the first and second valve casings 100 and 200, desired water tightness is<br>
achieved at the junctions between the ball 400 and the first and second valve casings<br>
100 and 200.<br>
The operation and effect of the ball valve of the present invention will be described<br>
herein below.<br>
First, both the packings 700 and the packing support units 800 arc coupled to the<br>
edges of the inner ends of the first and second through holes 140 and 240 of the first<br>
and second valve casings 100 and 200. In the above state, the ball 400 is seated in one<br>
of the first and second valve casings 100 and 200, for example, in the first valve casing<br>
100. Thereafter, the control lever 300 is coupled to the ball 400 while the stop<br>
projection 310 of the control lever 300 engages with the first stopper 111 of the first<br>
lever receiving part 110. Therefore, the conlrol lever 300 is stably placed in the first<br>
lever rccciving part 110 by the first stopper 111 without being allowed to be un-<br>
desirably removed from the first valve casing 100.<br><br>
Thereafter, the ring unit 500 is sealed in the first ring-shaped groove 132 which is<br>
provided along both the first coupling flange 130 and the first lever receiving part 110.<br>
The second valve casing 200 is, thereafter, coupled to the first valve casing 100 by the<br>
plurality of coupling bolls which are tightened into the plurality of first and second<br>
coupling holes 131 and 231. Thereafter, the cap 600 is fastened to both the first and<br>
second lever receiving parts 110 and 210, so that the control lever 300 is stably held in<br>
the first and second lever receiving parts 110 and 210.<br>
To control the valve, the ball 400 is rotated by the rotation of the control lever 300.<br>
At this time, even during the rotation of the ball 400, the ball 400 is in close contact<br>
with the packing support units 800. Therefore, the water tightness of the valve is<br>
maintained.<br>
In case that an error of the ball 400 is generated or an inspection of the ball 30 is<br>
necessary, the cap 600 is loosened from the first and second lever receiving parts 110<br>
and 210. Thereafter, the plurality of coupling bolls is loosened from the first and<br>
second coupling holes 131 and 231. One of the first and second valve casings 100 and<br>
200 is, thereafter, separated from a remaining one of the first and second valve casings<br>
100 and 200. Thus, the ball 400 and the control lever 300 are exposed to the outside of<br>
the ball valve. Thereafter, the ball 400 and the control lever 300 arc simply separated<br>
from the remaining one of the first and second valve casings 100 and 200, so that the<br>
ball 400 and the control lever 300 can be inspected to be managed, repaired or changed<br>
with new ones.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
As described above, the present invention provides a ball valve which has a<br>
structure possible to be made of a molten glass-fiber reinforced plastic (PRP) of a high<br>
acid resistancc or a molten thermosetting resin (SMC: sheet molding compound).<br>
Therefore, the ball valve of the present invention has the high acid resistance, so that<br>
the ball valve can be used in a variety of industrial fields. Particularly, the ball valve of<br>
the present invention can be manufactured through a thermal compression molding<br>
Drocess, and the structure of the ball valve is simplified. Accordingly, (he production<br>
costs of the ball valve are reduced.<br>
Furthermore, the water lightness of the ball valve of (he present invention is better<br>
than conventional ball valves. When errors arc caused in the ball valve, an inspection<br>
of the ball valve is easy. Another advantage of the ball valve of the present invention<br>
resides in that the assembling and disassembling processes of the ball valve arc<br>
simplified due to the simple structure of the ball valve, thus reducing working time.<br><br>
Although the preferred embodiment of the present invention has been disclosed for<br>

to engage with the first and second stoppers (1ll) and (211) of the first and<br><br>
second lever receiving parts (110) and (210);<br>
a ring unit (500) seated in both the first ring-shaped groove (132) of the<br>
first valve casing (100) and the second ring-shaped groove (232) of the second<br>
valve casing (200), the ring unit (500) comprising :<br>
a first ring part seated in parts of both the first and second ring-shaped<br>
grooves (132) and (232) provided on the first and second coupling flanges (130)<br>
and (230); and<br>
a second ring part integrally coupled to the first ring part and seated in<br>
parts of both the first and second ring-shaped grooves (132) and (232) provided<br>
on the first and second lever receiving parts (110) and (210); and<br>
a cap (600) fastened to both the first and second lever receiving<br>
parts (110) and (210).<br>
2.	The ball valve as claimed in Claim 1, further comprising :<br>

3.	The ball valve as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, further comprising :<br>
a packiag (700) and a packing support unit (800) provided around an inner<br>
end of each of first and second through holes (140) and (240) of the first and<br>
second valve casings (100) and (200).<br>
4.	A ball valve for controlling flow of fluids, substantially as hereinbefore<br>
described with particular reference to the accompanying drawings.<br><br>
This invention pertains to ball valves for controlling<br>
flow of fluids. The first conventional ball valves poses problems<br>
as a lengthy time is required to inspect the ball 30 due to a<br>
complicated disassembling of the parts. The second conventional<br>
ball valve having three constituent body parts causes inconvience<br>
to the user.<br>
The present invention aims at overcoming the<br>
inconveniences outlined above and relates to a ball valve to<br>
control a flow of a fluid. The ball valve includes symmetric<br>
first and second valve casings (100) and (200) which respectively<br>
have first and second ball seats (120) and (220), first and<br>
second coupling flanges (130) and (230), first and second lever<br>
receiving parts (110) and (210), first and second ring-shaped<br>
grooves (122) and (232), a plurality of first and second coupling<br>
holes (131) and (231), and first and second stoppers (111) and<br>
(211). The ball valve further includes a ball (400) which is<br>
seated in both the first and second ball seats (120) and (220),<br>
a control lever (300) which is coupled to the ball (400) to<br>
control the ball, and a ring unit (500) which is seated in both<br>
the first and second ring-shaped grooves (132) and (232). The<br>
ball valve further includes a cap (600) which is fastened to both<br>
the first and second lever receiving parts (110) and (210).</td>
