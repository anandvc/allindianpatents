The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of high purity citalopram and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts The particular salt envisaged by the invention is the hydrobromide sah. Citalopram having the Formula-I and its hydrobromide addition salt of the Formula-I(a) given below are well-known antidepressant drug available in the market. It is a selective, centrally active serotonin (5-hydroxy trypamine, 5-HT) re-uptake inhibitor, accordingly having antidepressant activities.<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION;<br>
The antidepressant activity of citalopram has been reported in several publications, eg. H. Dufour, et al. Int. Clin. Fsychopharmacol. 2, 225 (1987), L. Timmerman, et al, ibid, 239, and A, Gravem, Acta Psychiatr. Scand., 75, 478 (1987).<br>
Citalopram was first disclosed in DE Patent no. 2,657,271 corresponding to US Patent no. 4,136,193. This patent describes the process for the preparation of citalopram by two methods as shown in Scheme-I.<br><br><br><br>
In the first route shown in Scheme 1, 5-bromophthalide of the Formula-II was reacted with p-fluorophenylmagnesium halide to get a benzophenone derivative of the Formula-Ill, At this stage, this benzophenone derivative can be either reduced with lithium aluminium hydride or alkylated with 3-dimethylaminopropylmagnesium halide.<br>
Accordingly, in the first route, the lithium aluminium hydride reduced product of the Formula-IV was cyclized with 60% phosphoric acid to get the benzofiiran derivative of the Formula-V. This bromobenzofiiran derivative is reacted with copper cyanide to get the corresponding cyano derivative of the Formula-VI. The cyano derivative was alkylated with 3-dimethyl amino propyl chloride to get the citalopram of the Formula-I.<br>
In the second route, also shown in Scheme 1, benzophenone derivative of the Formula-Ill was reacted with 3-dimethylaminopropylmagnesium halide to get the dihydroxy compound of the Formula-VII. This dihydroxy compound was cyclized with 60% phosphoric acid to getthebromo analogue of the Formula-VIII of citalopram. Thebromo group was displaced by cyano group using copper cyanide to get the citalopram of the Formuia-I.<br>
The citalopram obtained from both the routes was purified by dissolving in ether and extracting into 25% aqueous acetic acid. The acetic acid solution was made alkaline with ION aqueous sodium hydroxide solution and extracted with ether. Purity of this purified citalopram was not mentioned in the patent. In the same patent it was mentioned that the hydrobromide salt of citalopram was prepared by conventional method. The melting point (182 - 183°C) of the hydrobromide salt of citalopram reported in this patent is 4 -5°C lower than the one reported inEP Patent no. 171,193. Purity of the pharmaceutically acceptable hydrobromide salt of citalopram was also not mentioned in the patent.<br>
The new route shown in Scheme-II, for the preparation of citalopram described in EP Patent no.171,193 starts with 5-cyanophthalide of the Formula-IX and follows the double Grignard path of original patent process. 5-Cyanophthalide was reacted with p-fluorophenylmagnesium halide to get the benzophenone derivative of the Formula-X which was reacted in situ with 3-dimethylaminopropylmagnesium halide to get the dihydroxy derivative of the Formula-XI. This dihydroxy compound was cyclized with 70% sulfuric acid to get the citalopram of the Formula-I.<br>
The citalopram prepared by this method is extracted into toluene at pH 10.0 and the extracted product was twice passed through a bed of silicagel (weight equal to product). After treatment with charcoal, hydrogen bromide gas is introduced into the acetone -toluene solution of chalopram base and made acidic until pH 3.0. pH is raised to 7.0 by adding some of the above citalopram base containing solution. The crude citalopram hydrobromide thus obtained was recrystallized from water after charcoal treatment. The crystals from the first recrystalHzation were dissolved in methanol - isopropyl alcohol medium and recrystallized after charcoal treatment. The material from this 2"** recrystalHzation is dissolved in a mixture of methanol and acetone and fihered with charcoal and recrystallized to get the pure citalopram hydrobromide with a melting point<br><br><br>
of 185 - 186°C, After three recrystallization a loss of 23 - 26% was reported in this process. Also, the chemical purity of the final crystalHzation material is not mentioned.<br>
Six solvents (a total of 46 - 47 liters per kg of citalopram hydrobromide) were used involving three recrystallizations and it took more than four days time.<br>
In the above said process, controlling the molar quantity of HBr gas seems to be difficult. So readjusting of pH with spare citalopram base solution is not an appropriate method for commercial scale operations. Also, fiUering citalopram base through silica gel column and three recrystallization techniques for purification of the hydrobromide saU with six solvents over a period of 4 - 5 days is not an economically viable process for plant scale operations. As a mixture of solvents were used in recrystallization technique, their reuse is again a tedious and difficult process.<br><br>
In the international patent no. WO 00/23431, citalopram base was dissolved in 15 times acetone and converted to its hydrobromide salt using aqueous HBr solution and isolated the salt by cooling and filtration. Purity of the citalopram hydrobromide is found to be &gt;90% (by HPLC), This raw citalopram hydrobromide is recrystallized from water. However, no yield and quality of the product is mentioned in this patent.<br>
In summary^ the original patent for pharmaceutically acceptable hydrobromide salt of citalopram does not describe any process for making it. Also, the quality of the product is not mentioned.<br>
The improved process for citalopram and its hydrobromide salt described in EP Patent no. 171,943 is not suitable for commercial scale as mentioned above.<br>
In the international Patent no. 00/23431 yield and quality of the citalopram hydrobromide is not mentioned after recrystalHzation from water.<br>
Citalopram has become a well-known antidepressant drug that has now been in the market and shown great promise as a valuable antidepressant drug with few side effects. To meet the market demand a simple and convenient process for preparing citalopram hydrbromide on a commercial scale is very much needed.<br>
Keeping in view of the difficuhies in commercialization of the processes disclosed in the above mentioned patents, we aimed our research work to develop a simple and convenient process for the preparation of citalopram and its hydrobromide salt which can be utilised for their commercial scale production with very high purity (99.5%).<br>
Accordingly, the main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of citalopram and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, particularly, hydrobromide salt of high purity (&gt;99.5%).<br>
According to another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of citalopram and its pharmaceutically acceptable salt, particularly hydrobromide salt, of high purity (&gt;99,5%) which is not only simple but also useful for their commercial production.<br>
According to still another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of citalopram and its pharmaceutically acceptable salt, particularly hydrobromide sah, of high purity (&gt;99.5%) by using weak aqueous organic acid such as acetic acid, propionic acid, succinic acid, oxalic acid to extract the crude citalopram base into water medium from the impurities-According to yet another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of citalopram and its pharmaceutically acceptable salt, particularly hydrobromide salt, of high purity (&gt;99.5%) by neutralizing the weak organic<br><br>
salts with weak bases such as aqueous ammonia, monomethyl amine, dimethyl amine or triethyl amine to a controlled pH,<br>
According to still another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of citalopram and its pharmaceutically acceptable salt, particularly hydrobromide salt, of high purity (&gt;99.5%) by extracting the purified base into a non-polar ether solvent or an aromatic solvent.<br>
According to yet another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of citalopram and its pharmaceutically acceptable salt, particularly hydrobromide salt, of high purity (&gt;99.5%) by isolating the crystalline citalopram from the same non-polar ether solvent or aromatic solvent by keeping the concentration at a certain level.<br>
According to another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of citalopram and its pharmaceutically acceptable salt, particularly hydrobromide sah, of high purity (&gt;99.5%) by employing aqueous HBr or HBr as commercially available HBr in acetic acid in the case of organic solvent as the medium of reaction.<br>
During our sustained research to develop a simple process for the preparation of citalopram and its pharmaceutically acceptable sah, particularly hydrobromide sah which can be used for their commercial production, we observed that a promising approach for such process would be to:<br>
(a)	replacing hazardous lithium aluminium hydride with sodium borohydride for the preparation of dihydroxy compound of formula IV shown in scheme 1 is very much cost effective<br>
(b)	avoidance of high vacuum distillation at the stage of formation of crude intermediate of the formula V shown in scheme 1 is very much advantageous<br>
(c)	removing the impurities from the intermediate of the formula VI instead of from the compound of the formula V shown in scheme 1 employing simple crystallization technique, thereby making the purification process simpler and more effective<br>
(d)	improve the quality of citalopram base formed in the reaction to an appropriate level so that the quality of hydrobromide salt would be of pharmaceutical grade<br>
(e)	select proper solvent system and conditions to keep the impurities present in citalopram base in solution form while making the sah<br>
(f)	select proper source of hydrogen bromide other than HBr gas to make the salt and<br>
(g)	avoid recrystallization technique, if possible to minimize the losses of citalopram salt, especially hydrobromide salt.<br>
-7<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Accordingly, the compound of formula VI was reacted with strong base such as NaH in DMSO medium and quenched with 3-dimethylaminopropylchloride to get the crude citalopram base of formula I,<br><br>
Accordingly, we found that if, one extracts the crude citalopram base into aqueous organic acids and controls the pH of this aqueous medium while extracting the base back into organic solvents, a lot of impurities can be eliminated at this stage itself Also by extracting the base into a reasonably less polar solvent, the quality of citalopram base can be improved. Further, if the source of HBr is non-gaseous, it would be easy to control the quantity required in making the chalopram hydrobromide. In addition, we have found that hydrobromide salt can be exclusively formed in the presence of a weak organic acid like acetic acid.<br>
