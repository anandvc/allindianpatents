				<td>Rodenticidal bait systems<br>
The present invention relates to water-based rodenticidal gels which do not cure, remain attractive to harmful rodents for long periods, retain their viscosity and adhere permanently to surfaces.<br>
As a rule, harmful rodents are controlled using rodenticide-containing feed baits. Conventional baits are made from loose cereals and a liquid or pulverulent premix containing the active ingredient. The product is a flowable cereal bait. If the mixture is treated with liquid paraffin and extruded, pellets or granules can be produced. The advantage of these variants over the flowable baits is the homogeneous distribution of the active ingredient. Wax bars are likewise produced from a paraffin-containing premix. This premix is extruded or poured into bars 10 g -100 g in weight. Bars are easily handled, but, as a rule, not very attractive to rodents owing to the high paraffin content. A modern development which combines the ease of handling of the wax bars with high attraction to rodents is the rodenticidal bait paste. Rodenticidal pastes are based on ground cereals and vegetable oils. Pastes are usually packaged in paper sachets in 10g- 100g portions. Low-viscosity pasty baits may also be packaged in cartridges.<br>
Flowable baits must be applied in containers such as dishes or bait boxes. Wax bars and paste sachets are placed in covered locations in such a way that they are protected from the effects of the weather. In animal houses, baits must be applied in such a way that they remain unaffected by cleaning and disinfection work. In general, the user of baits must ensure that anybody who is unauthorized such as, for example, children and non-target animals, such as, for example, domestic animals, cannot access the bait.<br>
Harmful rodents, in particular rats and mice, frequently attack properties where foodstuffs or feeding stuffs are being stored. Since they are capable of transmitting<br>
and excreting a number of pathogens, harmful rodents are controlled intensively in these susceptible spaces. Hygiene programmes generally demand regular, prophylactic control and monitoring. The control measures must meet two essential criteria: 1.) The bait used must be sufficiently attractive to the harmful rodents that they ingest it even in the presence of an excess of high-quality feed alternatives, and 2.) These rodenticides must be applied in such a way that they must not come into contact with the stored products or non-target animals.<br>
Pastes and flowable baits are preferably used owing to their good palatability. These baits are applied in specific bait containers to minimize any chances of contaminating the stored goods and to prevent non-target animals from reaching the compositions. Wax bars and pasty baits are additionally secured by tying.<br>
As a rule, bait boxes must be used to ensure safe application. These bait boxes are normally placed on the ground so that no bait can reach the stored products when rats or mice scratch in the bait containers.<br>
The disadvantage of this application technique is that the bait containers can frequently not be positioned where rats and mice prefer to dwell. These animals frequently nest in cavities of walls and ceilings, from where they can reach the stored products without running on the ground, for example via pipes, shelves and dividing walls. In this case, the control measures would be effective if a bait which is palatable to rats and mice and which cannot be spilt or carried away would be attached above or next to the stored products which serve as food supply to the harmful rodents. This bait must be attractive and contain high-quality food or feed in order to be accepted by the rodents as an alternative food source. If such a bait were applied without bait box, it would additionally be ensured that the control measures are not encumbered by the animals' fear of these containers.<br>
A bait which meets these requirements is unknown. While pasty baits which are based on oils and fats and which can be applied for example by squeezing a cartridge<br>
and initially adhere to the surface (for example JP 60255701) have been developed, these pastes frequently have the disadvantage that oil leaks from the cartridge when pressure is exerted, i.e. upon use, which makes neat handling impossible. Moreover, the oil spreads on the treated surface and the baits turn rancid and thus become unattractive and ineffective. They cure and then no longer adhere to the surface. Resulting particles may contaminate foodstuffs and feeding stuffs.<br>
Non fatty formulations are likewise known. However, they do not contain energy-containing feeding stuffs and are therefore not baits (for example WO 2001/080645), but concentrates or stickers (for example WO 98/04129, RU 2077200, DD 271012), have a shelf life of only a few days (for example Veterinariy 1990, No. 2, 29-30), are only suitable for controlling moles (for example US 6264969, FR 2767464), are intermediates in bait production, but are not ready for use (for example EP 97093, US 4480089). Such mixtures frequently contain a number of chemicals which make the product useless for use in baits, owing to the repellent odour (for example JP 51033964). It is known that such concentrates are produced on the basis of polyethylene glycol (PEG); for example JP 48001121. However, PEG is not eaten by rodents, but is only suitable as carrier in what are known as stickers. Upon contact, they stick to the animals' coat, but the animals only ingest the active ingredient when they clean their coats (see also JP 44012440). Other agents which ingested by rodents under certain circumstances, while being, are based, inter alia, on pectin or agar agar and therefore deteriorate rapidly and are therefore not suitable as baits (for example EP 2129376). Also known are water-in-oil dispersions (WO 2002/010212), hydrophobic, waxy formulas (FR 2067818) and gels which are provided with acute poisons, contain no feedstuffs but only flavourings and are applied in specifically developed containers for controlling exotic pests (EP 1094705).<br>
The invention aims at providing a bait system without the abovementioned disadvantages.<br>
The present invention relates to a new bait system consisting of a water-based rodenticidal gel which remains attractive to harmful rodents over a long period, does not cure, retains its viscosity and adheres permanently to surfaces. These gels according to the invention are applied without packaging or specially developed containers and are packaged ready for use. They can be applied safely and without bait boxes.<br>
The	gels according to the invention are dimensionally stable, readily deformable<br>
disperse systems encompassing the following components:<br>

(d)	bait materials;<br>
(e)	preservative.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the gels according to the invention additionally encompass one or more of the following components:<br>

A preferred viscosity range is 8,000-60,000 mPas, an especially preferred viscosity range 10,000 - 50,000 mPas. The viscosity is measured using a rotational viscometer (from HAAKE) at a shearing rate of D = 10 [1/sec], measured using a cone/plate system (4°). Owing to the heterogeneity of the gels, the readings vary. The viscosity can be adjusted by varying<br>
the nature and amount of the components, in particular of the thickener and of the bait material.<br>
The water content of the gels according to the invention can be varied within a wide range and is generally between 10 and 80% by weight. A preferable content is 15 -70% by weight, an especially preferred water content is 20 - 60% by weight.<br>

The following properties distinguish the proposed bait system as unique and especially effective:<br>
•	The bait material is highly attractive to rodents.<br>
•	The bait retains  this  attraction  even  in  a very humid  and warm or dry environment.<br>
•	The bait remains viscous, even after application, and adheres to the surface.<br>
•	The bait can be packaged in applicators ready for use.<br>
•	Neither packaging, applicator nor baited surface goes greasy or becomes stained.<br>
•	The bait is ingested without particles being distributed in the environment.<br>
•	The use of bait boxes can be dispensed with<br>
Surprisingly, it is possible that such a gel can be prepared and stored in such a form that it is ready for use, i.e. without the necessity of several components having to be mixed prior to application. This is all the more surprising since foodstuffs are formulated, according to the invention, into an aqueous gel without the gel perishing owing to fungal or bacterial growth.<br>
It is entirely surprising that even after storage and in the presence of high-quality alternative sources of food such as cereals and seeds, this bait is sufficiently attractive to harmful rodents such as house mice that infestation can be killed off in a comparatively short time span of a fortnight when using an anticoagulant active compound in the bait at the customary concentration.<br>
It should be noted that the gel does not cure upon storage or after application and does not leave oil or water marks on the surface. It is entirely surprising that the bait remains soft as long as 10 months after application and adheres to the surface without any signs of deterioration.<br>
The use of pigments for marking the bait as a rodenticide additionally prevents the staining of surfaces.<br>
It must be noted in particular that the gel even retains its attraction to rodents when it is stored for prolonged period at high temperatures. Following 8 weeks' storage at 50°C, no loss in palatability and efficacy was discernible. It was unexpected that a bait stored in this manner is ingested readily in comparison with cracked wheat and that it, when given in conjunction with wheat for not longer than 4 days, 100% mortality results in wild house mice.<br>
Surprisingly, the bait according to the invention also proved suitable for application to conduits (for example pipelines and cables) and dividing elements (for example dividing walls between pigsties) in animal houses without the use of bait boxes. Surprisingly, the bait did not desiccate even under high-ventilation conditions, continued to adhere and remained viscous. Even after several weeks, no changes in the bait were observed, despite the high microbial count in the air of the animal house.<br>
The invention is illustrated by the examples which follow.<br>
Preparation Examples<br>
Preparation method 1<br>
In a suitable reactor, the water thickener is stirred thoroughly together with the humectant. After a swelling time of approximately 15 minutes, water is added and the mixture is stirred for 10 minutes. Then, the bait material, the active compound, the preservative and the colour are added in succession with stirring, and stirring is continued for 15 minutes.<br>
Preparation method 2<br>
Water is introduced into a suitable reactor, and the water thickener is sprinkled onto the water surface. After a swelling time of approximately 15 minutes, the mixture is stirred thoroughly, and the humectant and the preservative are subsequently added. To thicken the mixture, the stated amount of base is added dropwise with stirring. The bait material, the active compound and the colour are subsequently added in succession with stirring, and stirring is continued for 15 minutes.<br>
The gels according to the invention which are listed in Table 1 below can be obtained by the methods stated above.<br>
