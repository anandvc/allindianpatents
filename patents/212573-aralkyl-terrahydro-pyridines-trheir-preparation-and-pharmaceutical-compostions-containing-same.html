"Aralkyltetrahydropyridines, their preparation and pharmaceutical compositions containing same"<br>
The present invention relates to novel aralkyltetrahydropyridines, the pharmaceutical compositions containing them, a method for their preparation and synthesis intermediates in this method.<br>
EP 0 458 697 describes -<br>
naphthylalkyltetrahydropyridine derivatives having an intestinal motility modulating activity.<br>
Bourrie et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1999, 96(22):12855-12859) have described the activity of_a compound called SR 57746 (1-(2-naphth-2-ylethyl)-4-(3-trifluoromethyl)-1,2,3,6~tetrahydropyridine) in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model and in the modulation of TNF-alpha (Tumor Necrosis Factor).<br>
It has now been found that some<br>
tetrahydropyridines, substituted with a partially saturated aralkyl radical, possess a potent activity on the modulation of TNF-alpha.<br>
T&amp;F-alpha is a cytokine which has recently aroused interest as a mediator of immunity, of inflammation, of cell proliferation, of fiforosis, etc. This mediator is present in abundance in inflamed synovial tissue and exercises an important role in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity (Annu. Rep, Med. Chem., 1997, 32:241-250).<br><br>
2<br>
Thus, the present invention relates, according to one of its aspects, to aralkyltetrahydropyridines of formula (I):<br><br>
in which<br>
X        represents N or CH;<br>
Ri       represents a hydrogen or halogen atom or a CF3<br>
group;<br>
n        is an integer from 1 to 5; A        represents a group of formula (a) to (d) :<br><br>
in which m is 1 or 2;<br>
and their salts or solvates and their N-<br>
oxides.<br><br>
3<br>
In the present description, the term "halogen" denotes an atom chosen from chlorine, bromine, iodine and fluorine.<br>
Preferred compounds are those where n is 1.<br>
Other preferred compounds are those where R1 is a CF3 group.<br>
Other preferred compounds are those where X is CH and R1 is at the 3-position of the benzene.<br>
Other preferred compounds are those where X is CH and Ri is a CF3 group.<br>
Other preferred compounds are those where X is N and pyridine is substituted at the 2,6-positions.<br>
The salts of the compounds of formula (I) according to the present invention comprise both the addition salts with pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic acids such as the hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulfate, hydrogen sulfate, dihydrogen phosphate, citrate, maleate, tartrate, fumarate, gluconate, methanesulfonate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, etc., and the addition salts which allow a suitable separation or crystallization of the compounds of formula (I), such as the picrate or oxalate, or the addition salts with optically active acids, for example camphorsulfonic acids and mandelic acids or substituted mandelic acids.<br>
According to the present invention, the compounds of formula (I) may exist as N-oxide<br><br>
4<br>
derivatives, in particular they may bear an N-oxide group on the tetrahydropyridine.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) can be synthesized by a method which involves (a)  reacting the compound of formula (II):<br><br>
in which R1 is as defined above, with the acid of formula (III) or one of its functional derivatives:<br><br>
in which n and A are as defined above, (b)  reducing the carbonyl group of the compound of formula (IV) thus obtained:<br><br><br>
5<br>
(c)  dehydrating the intermediate piperidinol of formula (V) thus obtained<br><br>
(d)  isolating the compound of formula (I) thus obtained and optionally converting it to one of its salts or solvates or to its N-oxide derivatives.<br>
The reaction of step (a) can be suitably carried out in an organic solvent at a temperature of between -10°C and the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture.<br>
It may be preferable to carry out the<br>
reaction at cold temperature when it is exothermic, as in the case where the chloride is used as functional derivative of the acid of formula (III).<br>
As compound of formula (III), it is possible to use either the free acid, optionally activated (for example with BOP, namely<br>
tri(dimethylamino)benzotriazol-l-yloxyphosphonium hexafluorophosphate), or one of its functional derivatives such as, for example, an anhydride, a mixed anhydride, an active ester or an acid halide,<br><br>
6<br>
preferably the bromide. Among the active esters, p-nitrophenyl ester is particularly preferred, but methoxyphenyl, trityl and benzhydryl esters, and the like, are also suitable.<br>
As reaction solvent, a halogenated solvent such as methylene chloride, dichloroethane, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, chloroform or the like, is preferably used, but other organic solvents compatible with the reagents used, for example dioxane, tetrahydrofuran or a hydrocarbon such as hexane, may also be used.<br>
The reaction may be suitably carried out in the presence of a proton acceptor, for example an alkali metal carbonate or a tertiary amine such as triethylamine.<br>
The reduction of step (b) may be suitably carried out by appropriate reducing agents such as borane complexes, for example borane-dimethyl sulfide ( [CH3]2S-BH3) , aluminum hydrides or a lithium aluminum hydride complex in an inert organic solvent, at a temperature of between 0°C and the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture, according to the customary techniques.<br>
The expression "inert organic solvent* is understood to mean a solvent which does not interfere with the reaction. Such solvents are for example ethers, such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran (THF), dioxane or 1,2-dimethoxyethane.<br><br>
7<br>
According to a preferred mode of operation, the procedure is carried out with the borane-dimethyl sulfide used in excess in relation to the starting compound (II), at the reflux temperature, optionally under an inert atmosphere. The reduction is normally complete after a few hours.<br>
The dehydration of step (c) is easily carried out, for example, using an acetic acid/sulfuric acid mixture, at a temperature of between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the solvent used-According to a preferred method, the reaction of step (c) is carried out in an acetic acid/sulfuric acid mixture in a 3/1 ratio by volume, by heating at the temperature of about 80-100°C for 1 to 3 hours.<br>
The desired compound is isolated according to conventional techniques in the form of a free base or of one of its salts. The free base may be converted to one of its salts by mere salification in an organic solvent such as em. alcohol, preferably ethanol or 2-propanol, an ether such as 1,2-dimethoxyethane, ethyl acetate, acetone or a hydrocarbon such as hexane. The compound of formula (I) obtained is optionally converted to one of its N-oxide derivatives.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) bearing an N-oxide group on the nitrogen atom of the tetrahydropyridine can be prepared by oxidation of the corresponding compound of formula (I). In this case, the compound of formula, (I) is subjected to an<br><br>
8<br>
oxidation reaction according to conventional methods, for example to a reaction with m-chloroperbenzoic acid in a suitable solvent, and isolated according to the usual techniques well known to persons skilled in the art.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) can also be prepared by a condensation reaction from a tetrahydropyridine of formula (VI):<br><br>
in which X and R1 are as defined above, with a compound of formula (VII):<br><br>
in which n and A are as defined above, and L is a leaving group, isolation of the compound of formula (I) thus obtained and optional conversion to one of its salts or solvates.<br>
As leaving group "L", it is possible for example to use a halogen group, or any other group suitable for condensation with the compound of formula (VI).<br><br>
9<br>
The condensation reaction is carried out by mixing the starting compounds (VI) and (VII) in an organic solvent such as an alcohol such as for example methanol or butanol, in the presence of a base such as for example alkali metal carbonates, at a temperature of between room temperature and the reflux temperature of the chosen solvent/ according to conventional methods.<br>
The starting compounds of formula (II) are known or they can be prepared in a similar manner to the known compounds.<br>
The compounds of formula (III°)<br><br>
in which A° is a group of formula (a), (c) or (d) as defined above, n is an integer from 1 to 5 and m is 1 or 2, and their salts or solvates are novel compounds and constitute a subsequent aspect of the present invention.<br>
When A is a group (a), these novel compounds are represented by formula (III')<br><br><br>
10<br>
where n and m are as defined above, and may be synthesized by a method which involves:<br>
(i)      reacting compound {VIII) below<br><br>
where m is 1 or 2, with a dialkyl carbonate in the presence of a strong base such as an alkali metal hydride, (ii)     reacting the compound of formula (IX) thus obtained<br><br>
with a Hal-(CH2)n-COOAlk derivative in which n is as defined above, Alk is an alkyl group and Hal is a halogen atom.<br><br>
11<br>
in the presence of a strong base such as an alkali metal hydride,<br>
(iii)    hydrolyzing and decarboxylating the compound (X) thus obtained<br><br>
by heating in the presence of a base, such as sodium hydroxide,<br><iv reducing the ketone of formula thus obtained></iv><br>
(v)      aromatizing the compound of formula (XII) thus obtained<br><br>
for example by oxidation with Pd/C at high temperature, in a solvent such as<br><br>
12<br>
Decalin, obtaining the compound of formula (III') which is isolated according to conventional methods and optionally converted to one of its salts.<br>
When A is a group (c), these novel compounds are represented by formula (III")<br><br>
where n and m are as defined above.<br>
When n is 0, these compounds may be synthesized according to a method which involves:<br>
(vi)     reacting the compound of formula (XIII)<br><br>
with polyphosphoric acid (PPA) and reducing the 9-oxofluorene derivative thus obtained, obtaining the compound of formula (III") where n is 0; and when n is 1,<br><br>
13 (vii)    esterifying and reducina the<br>
fluorenecarboxylic acid (XIV) thus obtained:<br><br>
for example by reaction with methanol in the presence of hydrochloric acid followed by reduction with LiAlH4 (viii)    converting the alcohol of formula (XV) thus obtained<br><br>
to a cyano derivative, for example by preparation of the corresponding chloride and reaction with KCN;<br>
(ix)     and hydrolyzing this cyano derivative of formula (XVI)<br><br><br>
14<br>
for example in an acid medium, obtaining the compound of formula (IIXW) where n is 1, which,is isolated according to conventional methods and optionally converted to one of its salts. If it is desired to prepare the compounds of formula (III*) where n is &gt; 1, it is sufficient to repeat the passages (vii)-(ix), although other known methods of synthesis may be used to extend the alkyl chain.<br>
When A is a group (d), these novel compounds are represented by formula (III'')<br><br>
where n and m are as defined above.<br>
The compounds of formula (III'') where n is 0 or 1, may be synthesized according to a method which involves;<br><x reacting the compound of formula></x><br><br>
15<br>
with (1-cyano-3,3-diethoxypropyl)diethyl phosphonate;<br>
(xi)     cyclizing the compound of formula (XVIII) thus obtained:<br><br>
for example in the presence of SnCl4, and (xii)    either hydrolyzing the cyano derivative of formula (XIX)<br><br>
obtaining the compound of formula (III'') where n is 0, (xiii)    or, when n is 1, converting the<br>
derivative of formula (XIX) to a ketone of formula (XX)<br><br><br>
16<br>
for example by a Grignard reaction with CH3MgI; and (xiv)    converting the ketone (XX) to the<br>
corresponding acid of formula (III'') where n is 1.<br>
If it is desired to prepare the compounds of formula (III'') where n is &gt; 1, it is sufficient to repeat the passages (vii)-(ix) above starting with the acid of formula (III'') as obtained in the passage (xiv), or to use other methods of synthesis known to extend the alkyl chain.<br>
When the cyclization of the passage (xi) is carried out starting with a beta-aldehyde, it is  possible to obtain two derivatives of formula (XIX), because the formation of the aromatic ring may be achieved by cyclization on one of the two adjacent positions. In this case, the isomers thus formed should be separated, for example by means of chromatography on  a silica gel column, and proceeding using the desired isomer.<br>
The reactions described above are in general well known to persons skilled in the art. Detailed examples of such methods are in any case reported in   the experimental section.<br>
The compounds of the invention have<br>
advantageous properties with respect to the inhibition of TNF- .<br><br>
17<br>
These properties were demonstrated with the aid of a test aimed at measuring the effect of molecules on the synthesis of TNF-  induced in Balb/c mice by lipopolvsaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia Coli (055;B5, Sigma, St. Louis, Mo).<br>
The test products are administered orally to groups of 5 female 7- to 8-week old Balb/c mice (Charles River, Prance). One hour later, the LPS is administered intravenously (10  g/mouse). The blood of each animal is taken 1.5 hours after the administration of the LPS. The samples are centrifuged and the plasma is recovered and frozen at -80°C. The TNF-a is measured using commercial kits (R and D, Abingdon, UK).<br>
In this test, representative compounds of the invention were found to be very active, by inhibiting the synthesis of TNF-a even at very low doses.<br>
By virtue of this activity and their low toxicity, the compounds of formula (I) and their salts or solvates can be used in the treatment of diseases linked to immune and inflammatory disorders or as analgesics. In particular, the compounds of formula (I) can be used for treating atherosclerosis, autoimmune diseases, diseases entailing demyelinization of the neurons (such as multiple sclerosis), asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, fibrotic diseases, pulmonary idiopathic fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, glumerulonephritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, osteoarttiritis, gout, bone and cartilage resorption,<br><br>

20<br>
In the pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention, the active principle can also be in the form of an inclusion complex in cyclodextrins, or ethers or esters thereof.<br>
The amount of active principle to be administered depends, as always, on the degree of progress of the disease as well as the age and weight of the patient. Nevertheless, the unit doses generally comprise from 0.001 mg to 100 mg, better still from 0.01 mg to 50 mg and preferably from 0.1 mg to 20 mg of active principle, advantageously from 0.5 mg to 10 mg.<br>
