				<td>Description of the Invention]<br>
[Field of the Invention]<br>
This invention relates to the improvement of a footrest structure for a scooter-type motorcycle.<br>
[Related Art]<br>
Generally, a scooter-type motorcycle includes low floor type footrests as disclosed in the following documents: (1) Japanese Utility Model Laid-open No. Sho. 62-181487; (2) Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Sho. 62-221986; and (3)<br>
Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Hei. 1-101281.<br>
In the document (1), the rider footrests are flat across the motorcycle body, and slope down at their front parts and slope up at the rear part thereof. Passenger footrests are positioned behind the rider footrests, and are in the shape of ribs extending in the widthwise direction of the motorcycle body.<br>
The document (2) discloses that the rider footrests are flat across the motorcycle body similarly to those in the document (1), are slope down at the front parts thereof, and have the same width at both front and rear parts thereof.<br>
According to the document (3), the rider footrests are flat across the motorcycle body and slope down at the front parts thereof as in the document (1). The passenger footrests are provided behind the rider footrest, and project outward compared with the rider footrests.<br>
[Problems to be solved by the Invention]<br>
In the documents (1) to (3), the footrests extend flat across the motorcycle body, or the footrests slope down along their outer side edges.<br>
Therefore, it is somewhat difficult for the rider to keep his or her feet firmly toward the outer side edges of the footrests.<br>
Further, since the footrests slope down at their front parts, the rider sits on the motorcycle with his legs stretched forward and tends to feel difficulty in firmly maintaining his or her feet on the front parts of the footrests during cruising or the like.<br>
In addition, the rider footrests are given preference over the passenger footrests. Some passengers' footrests extend outward compared with the rider footrests, and have a problem in that the passenger cannot use the footrests comfortably and reliably.<br>
This invention has been made in order to overcome the foregoing problems of the related art.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a footrest structure for a motorcycle in order that the rider can keep his or her feet on the footrests reliably,<br>
comfortably and firmly during cruising, or when traveling in a winding manner such as when turning or steering.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide a footrest structure for a motorcycle in order that not only can the rider reliably keep his or her feet on the footrests but also the passenger can hold his or her feet reliably and comfortably on the footrests without widening his or her legs, i.e. with his or her knees, legs and feet maintained tight.<br>
[Means for solving the Problems]<br>
In order to overcome the foregoing problems, claim 1 defines a footrest structure for a motorcycle provided with a low floor which extends between a steering handle and a rider seat and across a motorcycle body and has footrests along opposite side edges. The footrests slope down toward the center of the motorcycle body, and are low at inner side edges thereof compared with outer side edges, The footrests slope down toward the center of the motorcycle body, i.e. the footrests are lower along the center of the motorcycle body than at their outer side edges. This can prevent the rider's feet from sliding on the footrests and projecting from the footrests without the rider being aware of it.<br>
Claim 2 defines that each of the footrests of claim 1 comprises a main step extending along the length of the motorcycle and a short sub-step extending behind the main step. The main step slopes up at a front portion thereof and is high compared with a rear portion thereof, and the sub-step slopes up at its rear end and is low at a front portion thereof.<br>
According to claim 2, each of the footrests comprises a long main step extending along the length of the motorcycle and the short sub-step positioned behind the main step. The main step slopes up at a front portion thereof and is high compared with a rear portion thereof, while the sub-step slopes up at a rear end thereof and is low at a front portion thereof.<br>
With respect to claim 2, when the rider places his or her feet on the front parts of the main steps that slope up, front parts of the feet similarly slope up. Even when the rider stretches his or her legs, the feet remain sloping up. Therefore, the rider can firmly hold his or her feet on the main steps, and continue cruising in a comfortable posture. Further, the rider's feet on the sub-steps slope down. During winding travel, such as when turning, steering and so on, the rider can firmly hold his or her feet on the sub-steps.<br>
Claim 3 defines a footrest structure for a motorcycle provided with a low floor which extends between a steering handle and a rider seat and across a motorcycle body and has footrests along opposite side edges. Each of the footrests comprises a rider footrest at the front part thereof and a passenger footrest extending behind the rider footrest and reaching substantially a lower part of the rider seat; and a practical center distance between the passenger footrests is smaller than a practical center distance between the rider footrests.<br>
According to claim 3, the passenger footrests are present inside the outer side edges of the motorcycle body, so that the passenger's feet do not project outward from the side edges of the rider footrests. Further, opposite side walls of a body cover located inside the passenger footrests recede toward the center of the motorcycle body, which enables the passenger to place his or her legs including heels and feet in the receding parts of the body cover. This means that the passenger can sit on the motorcycle with his or her legs kept tight. The footrests are preferable for woman passengers.<br>
Accordingly the present invention relates to a footrest structure for a motorcycle comprising a frame being provided at the front end thereof with a head pipe, a steering handle being arranged on the head pipe, a front fork 4 being supported by the head pipe for steering a front wheel through the steering handle , a power unit having an engine being supported on the rear part of the frame, a rider seat being positioned above the power unit, a low floor extending between the steering handle and the rider seat, and footrests extending along opposite sides edges in the lateral direction of a motorcycle body, characterized in that<br>
the footrests is provided toward the center of the motorcycle<br>
body and the inner side edges of the said footrests is lower than outer<br>
side edges of the said footrest.<br>

Fig. 8 shows how the rider uses the footrests during winding travel. <br>
A motorcycle will be outlined with reference to Figs. 1 and 2. The motorcycle 1 includes a low floor extending between a steering handle and a seat and across a motorcycle body, and having a pair of footrests 30, 30.<br>
In the motorcycle 1, a head pipe 2a at the front end of a frame 2 supports a front fork 4 in order that the front fork 4 can be steered as desired. A front wheel 3 is supported by the front fork 4. A steering handle 5 is in the shape of a widened letter U, which is low at its front center, slopes rearwardly up to the right and left, and is provided with handgrips at opposite ends.<br>
The frame 2 comprises: two main frames 2b, 2b (see Figs. 5 and 6) positioned behind the rear end of the head pipe 2 and sloping down and to the rear; and a sub-frame 2c (shown in Figs. 5 and 6) sloping down from the upper part of the rear end of the head pipe 2a, positioned between the main frames 2b, 2b, and extending rearward. A fuel tank 6 is housed in a front part defined by the frames 2b, 2b and 2c. <br>
A front cowl 7 extends over the front parts of the head pipe 2a, main frames 2b, 2b, and sub-frame 2c, and is provided with a headlamp unit 8 on its front part, a windscreen 9 at its upper part, and a pair of right and left rear view mirrors 10, 10 at its opposite side ends. Further, the front cowl 7 is provided with a pair of helmet supports 7b, 7b on its rear side. The helmet supports 7b, 7b are attached to opposite ends of a steering post cover 7a in such a manner that they extend across the head pipe 2a.<br>
The steering post cover 7a is in the shape of an inverted letter U, and slopes down slightly obliquely and rearward. A pair of knee covers project from the steering post cover 7a.<br>
Referring to Figs. 5 and 6, a center floor cover 11 in the shape of an inverted letter U extends along the length of the motorcycle and surrounds the center to rear parts of the main frames 2b, 2b and the sub-frame 2c. A concave under cover 12 extends over an underside of the frame 2 including footrests which will be described later.<br>
A unit swing type power unit 13 including an engine 13a is swingably supported behind the frame 2. A rear wheel 14 serving as a driving wheel is attached to the rear end of the power unit 13. A rear cushion unit 15 is interposed between the rear end of the power unit 13 and the rear part of the frame.<br>
A first exhaust chamber 16a is positioned immediately behind the engine 13a. A muffler 16 is provided behind the first exhaust chamber 16a and on one side of the motorcycle. An air cleaner 17 which is identical or similar to the muffler 16 in its shape and size is provided on the other side of the motorcycle body. In other words, the muffler 16 and the air cleaner 17 are arranged on the opposite sides of the motorcycle body, thereby improving the external appearance of the motorcycle. <br>
A rear cover 18 extends over the rear part of the motorcycle, and comprises a seat post cover portion 18a at a front half thereof, and a rear cover portion 18b at a rear half thereof. The center floor cover 17 and rear cover 18 constitute a body cover 50.<br>
A tandem type seat 19 is positioned on the middle to front half of the rear cover 18, and can accommodate two persons. The seat 19 includes a front part 19a and a rear part 19b. The front part 19a overlaps with the rear part 19b, and is slidable by approximately 50mm in order to adjust its position back and forth.<br>
A pair of passenger guards 20, 20 are provided for the passenger seat. Each passenger guard extends between the right and left middle part, and the front part of the rear cover 18. A pair of passenger grab rails 20a are provided at<br>
the top ends of the passenger guards 20.<br>
A storage compartment is provided behind the seat 19, i.e. at the rear part of the rear cover 18, and is covered by a lid 21 hinged along one side edge. The motorcycle with the foregoing structure has a pair of footrests 30, 30 as described hereinafter.<br>
The right and left footrests 30, 30 are symmetrical, and extend along the length of the motorcycle. In this embodiment, they resemble a pair of skis as shown by a top plan view in Fig. 4.<br>
Each footrest 30 comprises a rider footrest 31, and a passenger footrest 32 continuing behind the rider step 32. The passenger footrest 32 substantially reaches the underside of the rider seat 19a. The rider step 31 includes a long main step 31c, and a short sub-step 31d continuing behind the main step 31c.<br>
The footrests 30, 30 sandwich the steering post cover 7a at the lower rear surface of the front cowl 7, and extend over the lower opposite sides of the center floor cover 11, and the front opposite sides of the rear cover 18 behind the center floor cover 11. Referring to Fig. 4, each footrest 30 has a front part 30a whose outer edge is curved toward the center of the motorcycle body. The front part 30a slopes up as shown in Figs. 1 and 3.<br>
Each footrest 30 has a maximum width at the bottom of the curved front part 30a as shown in Fig. 4, and is gradually tapered toward its rear end, i.e. a side edge 30b of the footrest 30 comes close to the center line C of the motorcycle body. The right and left footrests 30, 30 sandwich the center floor cover 11 therebetween as shown in Figs. 5 and 6.<br>
Inner side edges 30c of the footrests 30 are supported by receptacles lib, lib folded outward at the bottoms of side walls lla of the center floor cover 11. The outer side edges 30b of the footrests 30, 30 are supported by opposite upper side edges 12a, 12a of the under cover 12.<br>
Referring to Figs. 5 and 6, the footrests 30, 30 slope down by a predetermined angle 6 toward the center of the motorcycle body, so that the outer side edges 30b are higher than the inner side edges 30a.<br>
The footrests 30, 30 slope down toward the center of the motorcycle body as a whole. The rider footrests 31 in Fig. 5 and the passenger footrests 32 in Fig. 6 have sloping surfaces.<br>
The angle 9 may be different for the rider footrests 31 and the passenger footrests 32. Further, in the footrests 30, 30, the rider footrests 31 slope up at the front parts 31a by an angle 6 1, so that the front parts 31a are higher than the rear parts 31b. With this structure, the rider footrests 31 have the main steps 31c sloping up as a whole.<br>
The sub-steps 3 Id extend behind the main steps 31c, and steeply slope up by an angle 6 2 larger than 6 1 from the rear ends 31b of the rider footrests.<br>
In other words, the main steps 31c have the front ends 3 la sloping up and higher than the rear ends 31b. Further, the sub-steps 3 Id slope up and have the front ends (i.e. the rear ends 31b of the main steps 31c) being lower than the rear ends 31e.<br>
Referring to Fig. 3, the passenger footrests 32 extend behind the sub-steps 31c, and slope down by an angle 0 3 at the rear ends 31e of the sub-steps 3 Id, toward the rear part of the motorcycle. <br>
As clearly shown in Fig. 4, with the footrests 30, 30, the centers PI of the passenger footrests 32 come close to the center of the motorcycle body compared with the centers P of the rider footrests 31 which are at the front and middle parts of the motorcycle.<br>
In other words, as shown in Fig. 4, a distance LI (practical center distance LI) between the useful centers PI and PI of the passenger footrests 32, 32 is set to be smaller than a distance L (useful center distance L) between the useful<br>
centers P, P of the rider footrests 31,31.<br>
The footrests 30, 30 have their inner side edges sloping down toward the center of the motorcycle, i.e. are higher along the outer side edges thereof. Therefore, the footrests 30, 30 are at a high level compared with opposite side edges of the under cover 12 positioned thereunder. This makes it possible to set large right and left bank angles when the motorcycle is inclined.<br>
The rider footrests 31 slope up at the front ends thereof and are low at the rear ends thereof as shown in Figs. 1 and 3. Therefore, the rider places his or her feet 40a on the main steps 31c sloping up as shown in Fig. 7, i.e. the feet 40a are on the main steps 31 with the front parts thereof sloping up.<br>
Therefore, even when the rider keeps his or her legs 40b in a stretched state as shown in Fig. 7, he or she can comfortably continue cruising with the feet reliably and firmly held on the footrests. Further, when a passenger is also seated on the motorcycle as shown in Fig. 7, he or she can firmly place his or her feet 41a on the passenger footrests 32 sloping up, with their front parts sloping up, similarly to the rider footrests 31. Further, the sub-steps 3 Id behind the rear parts of the main steps 31c slope up rearward as described above.<br>
When the rider places his or her feet 40a on the sub-steps 3 Id as shown in Fig. 8, the feet 40a slope down forward. As a result, the rider performs a winding operation such as turning or steering, on tiptoe, so that bottom surfaces of the feet 40a including heels slope down and forward and a large force is applied in a rearward direction. This enables the rider to firmly place his or her feet 40a on the sub-steps 3 Id, which is advantageous during turning or steering.<br>
Referring to Figs. 3 and 6, the opposite sides of the rear cover 18 including the rear part of the center floor cover 11 recede toward the center of the motorcycle body, at the position corresponding to the opposite sides of the<br>
passenger footrests 32 (i.e. portions 22, 22 are formed on the opposite sides of the body cover 50). Further, as shown in Fig. 4, the practical center distance LI of the passenger footrests 32, 32 is smaller than the practical center distance L of the left and right rider footrests 31, 31. This means that the passenger footrests 32, 32 are located inside the rider footrests 31, 31.<br>
Therefore, the passenger's feet 40a do not project outside the outer side edges of the rider footrests, i.e. the outer side edges of the motorcycle. <br>
Especially, the portions 22, 22 are provided on the opposite sides of the body cover 50, inside the passenger footrests 32, 32. Front and rear seats 19a and 19b are independent from each other. A front end of the rear seat 19b is narrowed, which enables the passenger to maintain his or her legs 41b including heels and calves, close to the portions 22, 22, as shown in Fig. 6.<br>
As a result, the passenger 41 does not have to spread out his or her legs 41a and feet 41b, and can keep them as tight as possible. This feature is preferable for woman passengers.<br>
As described with reference to the embodiment, the footrests 30, 30 slope down toward the center of the motorcycle body, and slope up at the front ends thereof. Further, since the rider footrests 31 include the sub-steps 31d at the rear ends thereof which slope up and to the rear, water may gather on the footrests 30, 30. In order to overcome this problem, draining holes may be partly formed in the footrests, or the footrests may be formed by porous plates or nets.<br>
[Effects of the Invention]<br>
The invention is effective in the following respects.<br>
According to claim 1, the footrest structure is applied to the motorcycle provided with a low floor which extends between a steering handle and a rider seat and across a motorcycle body and has footrests along opposite side edges. The footrests slope down toward the center of the motorcycle body. The inner side edges of the footrests are lower than the outer side edges thereof, which<br>
enables the rider to hold his or her feet facing inward on the footrests.<br>
The rider can keep his or her feet firmly and reliably on the footrests, preventing them from sliding outward. Since the legs lean inward and are slow to move outward, it is possible to prevent them from projecting out of the footrests without the rider being aware of it.<br>
Further, the footrests have the high outer side edges compared with the inner side edges, so that the opposite sides of the under cover under the footrests are at a high level. This enables the right and left bank angles to be set large when the motorcycle leans over.<br>
In addition to the feature in claim 1, the footrests comprise long main steps and short sub-steps extending behind the main steps. The main steps slope up at their front ends and are high compared with the rear ends thereof. The sub-steps have their front ends sloping up compared with the rear ends thereof. When the rider places his or her feet on the main steps sloping up forward, he or she can maintain his or her feet sloping up while he or she rides on the motorcycle with his or her legs stretched. Therefore, the rider can continue cruising with a comfortable posture with his or her feet placed on the footrests firmly and reliably.<br>
The sub-steps behind the main steps slope up and to the rear.   When the rider places his or her feet thereon with the front parts thereof sloping down, he or she can hold his or her feet firmly, which is effective when the motorcycle is turned, steered or the like. According to claim 3, in the motorcycle provided with a low floor which extends between a steering handle and a rider seat and across a motorcycle body and has footrests along opposite side edges, each footrest comprises rider footrest at the front part thereof and a passenger footrest extending behind the rider footrest. The practical center distance between the passenger footrests is smaller than the practical center distance between the rider footrests. Therefore,<br>
the passenger footrests are positioned inside the outer side edges of the rider footrests, so that the passenger's feet do not project outside the rider footrests.<br>
The opposite sides of the body cover recede toward the center of the motorcycle body at the positions corresponding to the inner sides of the passenger footrests. This enables the passenger to place his or her legs close to the receding portions of the body cover, i.e. the passenger can keep his or her legs, heels and feet tight on the motorcycle. This is advantageous for woman<br>
passengers.<br>
