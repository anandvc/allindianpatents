This invention generally relates to agricultural products. More particularly tlie invenUon relates to special kind of mats. Tlie invention accordingly relates to an " Air Cushion Rubber Mat / Rug " which can be used as an anti fatigue Mat / Rug where people need to stand- for a long time to work or do physical exercises.<br>
This invention due to its typical method of manufacture creating air inside the cavities of these Rubber Mats/Rugs can give cushion effect. Since Rubber Mats/Rugs are made of rubber they are highly versatile products. They can be made to any size, shape and colour as per requirement and can be made to adjust witli any ambience. Since tliey are made of natural rubber and other natural products they aie bio degradable and hence enviromnent friendly. They are fungus resistant and varying weather conditions do not alter tlie nature of the product. These are the salient featuies of the invention.<br>
Anti fatigue Mat according to invention can be used in place of work where people stand at work for longer time. Since it is made widi air filled rubber lubes it gives utmost comfort to the weight bearing joints of human body. The air inside the mat acts as cushion which helps to reduce die fatigue of human legs. This can also be used as protective guard against physical damage to people who practice exercising gymnastics, wrestling etc. It can also be used for purpose of laying on tlie floor where people have to stand - for a long time such as counters at the air ports, banks, railway stations, boat houses, Immigration counters, cinema halls, super markets etc. where people stand and transact for long time. Il can also be used in floors and walls of kids/children play room and gynniasiums as a protection against hazardous impact to safe guard them from injuries.<br>
At die outset of Uie description which follows it is to be unders'ood that ensuing description only illustrates a particular form of this invention. However such paiticular form is only an exemplary embodiment witliout intending to imply any limitation on the scope of this invention. Accordingly die description is to be understood as an exemplary embodiment and reading of die invention is nof intended to be taken restrictively.<br>
The foregoing descriplion is rather broadly preferred and alternative feature of die present invention so diat tiiose skilled in die art may better understand die detailed description of the invention tiiat follows. Additional features of die invention will be described hereinafter diat fonn die subject of clauns of<br><br>
the mveation. Tliose skilled in the art »hov4U rewli^E© moh «qwivalent conception do not depart from the spirit and scope of the invention in its broadest form.<br>
. Now the invention will be described in detail with reference to drawings which accompany with complete specification. The nature of the invention and the maimer in which the invention is to be performed is clearly described in the description of the complete specification.<br>
The invention is described witJi reference to drawings which accompany Uie aomplete 8p
Fig 1, Fig 2 and Fig 3 of tlie drawings show air cushions, rubber mat-rug when the chemicals react witli heat to form air inside the mat.<br>
Fig 4 &amp; Fig 5 of the drawings show the air cushion mbber mat stoke rug after completion of the process according to tlie invention.<br>
The process of manufactming air cushion rubber mat/rug includes the following steps.<br>
1.       Making of Rubber Tubes<br>
The compounds used for niakiiig rubber lubes are<br>
1.	Natural Rubber<br>
2.	Reclaimed Rubber<br>
3.	China Clay<br>
4.	Stearic Acid<br>
5.	Zinc Oxide<br>
6.	Sulphur<br>
7.	Tyre Powder<br>
8.	Silica<br>
9.	Barites<br>
10.	MerCure-F 11/ TMT<br>
12.  Calcium Carbonate '   13.  Rubber Process Oil<br><br>
All the above compounds are mixed together tlioroughly aiid the resulting mixturo ii p^Ms^d through 18 mm »3Ktinidcir fo mnk^ flio tubwwUb n length of 36 inches.<br>
»<br>
2.     Making of Rubber Sheets<br>
Tlie compounds used for making (he Rubber Sheets nm<br>
1.	Rubber<br>
2.	Reclaimed Rubber<br>
3.	China Clay<br>
4.	Stearic Acid<br>
5.	Zinc Oxide<br>
6.	Sulphur<br>
7.	Tyre Powder<br>
8.	Silica<br>
9.	Barites<br>
10.	MerCure-F<br>
11.	TMT<br>
12.	Calcium Cabonate<br>
13.	Rubber Process Oil<br>
All the above compounds arc mixed together in a vessel and put in a mould to make a sheet.<br>
3.     Making of Air forminu compound<br>
Tlie materials used for making tlie aii" forming compound are  .<br>
1.	Sodium Niti-ite<br>
2.	Ammonium Chloride<br>
3.	Zinc Stearate<br>
4.	Magnesium Sulphate ;<br>
All these compounds are powdered and mixed togetlier to fomi a mbcture which would be made into small tablets to be put inside die rubber tubes.<br><br>
4.    Specially designed mould<br>
A metallic mould using MS iron is made for the purpose of correctly fitting in tlie tubes and a hydraulic press which could give a pressure of one tonne is attached with the mould.<br>
Tlie process of manufacture<br>
The rubber tubes as specified in (1) are filled with gas forming compound tablets and placed in the slots designed in tlie mould and the rubber sheet as specified in (2) is placed on top of it. Then the materials are heated to a temperature of 125 degree Celsius and simultaneously the hydraulic pressure with a combined pressure of one tonne is appUed on top of it. Tlie heating and pressure continues for a period of 20 minutes. With a sustained heating ■ for 20 minutes the air forming compound kept inside each tube would produce a combined quantity of air to die tune of 1650 cc in each tube which would fill the tube to give optimum pressure. At the end of 20 minutes tlie fmal product is taken outside and placed on a wooden rack. By (his time the rubber sheet and tJie tubes would be vulcanized together to form a single unit product witli an appearance of a flat sufface on one side and witli a wedged surface on the other side.<br>
The invention has been explained in relation to specific embodiment. It is inferred that the foregoing description is only illustrative of tlie present invention and it is not intended dial the invention be limited or restrictive diereto.. Many otJier specific embodiment of llie present invention will be apparent to one skilled in die art from the foregoing disclosuie. All substitution, alterations and modification of tlie present invention which come within the scope of die following claims aie to which die present . invention is readily susceptible without departing from die spirit of the invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
