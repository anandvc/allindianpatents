[Title of the Invention]  GRAB RAIL MOUNTING STRUCTURE OF<br>
MOTORCYCLE<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a grab rail mounting structure to be mounted on a rear portion of a vehicle body frame of a motorcycle. [Background Art]<br>
[0002]<br>
Hitherto, a grab rail mounting structure to be mounted to a rear portion of a vehicle body frame of a motorcycle is known (for example, see Patent Document 1).<br>
[Patent Document 1] JP-A-2003-306180 (Fig. 7)<br>
[0003]<br>
A grab rail mounting structure in which a cross member 8 (the same reference numerals as in the abovementioned Patent Document are used, hereinafter) is extended between a pair of left and right seat rails 5, 5, a seat lock device 26 is arranged at a center of the cross member 8 in the width direction of a vehicle, brackets 33, 33 as base members of the grab rail 27 are arranged on the cross member 8 laterally of the seat lock device 26, and the brackets 33, 33 and the seat lock device 26 are covered by a seat 21 shown by an imaginary line is shown in Fig. 7 in Patent Document 1.<br><br>
[0004]<br>
A housing section 30a of the seat lock device 26 also serves as a receiving portion of the seat 21, that is, a seat receiving portion.<br>
[0005]<br>
When the lateral distance between the seat receiving portions are required to be increased in order to enhance the safety of the seat 21, in the structure shown in Patent Document 1, the lateral distance cannot be enlarged since the seat receiving portions are located inside the brackets 33, 33 and hence interferes with the brackets 33, 33.<br>
Therefore, a structure in which the lateral distance between the seat receiving portions can be enlarged even though the grab rail mounting portions such as the brackets 33, 33 are located nearby is required. [Disclosure of the Invention] [Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
[0006]<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a structure in which a lateral distance between seat receiving portions can be enlarged even through a grab rail mounting portions are located nearby. [Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
[0007]<br>
The invention according to Claim 1 is, in a grab rail<br><br>
mounting structure for a motorcycle in which a grab rail which a passenger can grab is mounted on a rear portion of a vehicle body frame, characterized in that a seat receiving portion is integrally formed on the outsides of mounting seats of the grab rail with respect to the vehicle body frame at a level higher than the mounting seats.<br>
[0008]<br>
The invention according to Claim 2 is characterized in that a protective wall for covering the sides of the mounting seats is formed integrally with the seat receiving portion.<br>
[0009]<br>
The invention according to Claim 3 is characterized in that the mounting seats are provided in the front and the rear in pair, and the seat receiving portion is provided between the mounting seats. [Advantage of the Invention]<br>
[0010]<br>
In the invention according to Claim 1, the seat receiving portion is formed on the outside of the mounting seats of the grab rail with respect to the vehicle body frame at a level higher than the mounting seats, and the heights of the seat receiving portion and the mounting seats are offset in the vertical direction.<br>
[0011]<br>
Since the seat receiving portion is formed on the outside<br><br>
of the mounting seats of the grab rail with respect to the vehicle body frame, even when the left and right seat receiving portions which receive a load of a seat are arranged so as to be shifted outward, the seat receiving portion and the grab rail mounting portions do not interfere with each other.<br>
[0012]<br>
In addition, even when the heights of the seat receiving portion and the mounting seats are offset from each other in the vertical direction, if the height of heads of grab rail mounting bolts can be kept within an offset amount, interference between the heads of the mounting bolts to be provided on the mounting seats and seat side members does not occur.<br>
[0013]<br>
According to the present invention, since the seat receiving portion is integrally formed at a level higher than the mounting seats, the seat receiving portion and the mounting seats can be arranged at positions close to each other. Since a space for avoiding interference is not necessary on the side of the seat side members, a space for arrangement of the seat receiving portion and the mounting seats can be downsized.<br>
[0014]<br>
In the invention according to Claim 2, the protective walls for covering the sides of the mounting seats are formed integrally with the seat receiving portion. Since the seat<br><br>
receiving portion is formed on the outsides of the mounting seats, the protective walls are formed on the outsides of the mounting seats, and hence the mounting seats can be protected from the outside. Since the mounting seats can be protected from the outsides, it is difficult to operate the mounting bolts from the outsides, and hence there is an advantage such that an anti-theft effect can be improved.<br>
[0015]<br>
In the invention according to Claim 3, since the mounting seats are provided in the front and the rear in pair and the seat receiving portions are provided between the mounting seats, the seat receiving portions can be arranged so as to overlap at least partly with fastening members mounted to the mounting seats in the lateral direction.<br>
By arranging the seat receiving portions so as to overlap at least partly with the fastening members mounted to the mounting seats in the lateral direction, the left and right seat receiving portions can be arranged closer in the lateral direction.<br>
By arranging the left and right seat receiving portions closer to each other in the lateral direction, there is an advantage such that the space for arranging the seat receiving portions with respect to the vehicle body frame is not necessary to increase more than necessary. [Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention]<br><br>
[0016]<br>
Referring now to the attached drawings, a best mode for carrying out the invention will be described below. The terms, "front", "rear", "left ", "right", "top", "bottom" are directions based on a driver, and reference sign Ft represents the front side, Rr represents the rear side, L represents the left side, R represents the right side, T represents the top side, and the B represents the bottom side. The drawings are to be viewed in the orientation in which reference numerals are viewed in the right way.<br>

[0030]<br>
Fig. 6 shows a perspective view of the grab rail mounting structure according to the present invention. Description will be given below referring to Fig. 3 and Fig. 6.<br>
The grab rail 31 includes a main body 61, extending portions 62, 62 extending inward from the main body 61, the mounting seats 52... provided on the extending portions 62, 62, the seat receiving portions 54, 54 arranged on the outsides of the mounting seats 52..., and the protective walls 63, 63 to be arranged on the laterally outsides of the seat receiving portions 54, 54. Then, the seat receiving portions 54, 54 are integrally formed on the outsides of the mounting seats 52.. . of the grab rail 31 with respect to the vehicle body frame 13 at a higher level than the mounting seats 52....<br>
[0031]<br>
The protective walls 63, 63 are formed integrally with<br><br>
the seat receiving portions 54, 54, and wrap-around portions 64... are provided in the front and rear of the protective walls 63, 63.<br>
In other words, the seat receiving portions 54, 54 are integrally formed with the protective walls 63, 63 for covering the sides of the mounting seats 52... and the mounting bolts 59..., and the protective walls 63, 63 are provided with the wrap-around portions 64... for covering the front and rear of the mounting seats 52... and the mounting bolts 59....<br>
[0032]<br>
The arrangement relation between the seat receiving portion 54 and the protective wall 63 will be described below.<br>
The seat receiving portion 54 is a member provided at a center in the fore-and-aft direction and at a center between the mounting seats 52, 52 in the fore-and-aft direction, and projected from between the mounting bolts 59, 59 mounted to the mounting seats 52, 52. In plan view, the protective wall 63 and the seat receiving portion 54 are formed into substantially an E-shape.<br>
[0033] The seat receiving portions 54, 54, each having a circular top surface, are arranged in such a manner that outer peripheral surfaces  of the seat  receiving portions  54,  54  are circumscribed with outer edges 65, 65 of the protective walls 63, 63 so that the seat receiving<br><br>
portions 54, 54 are positioned on the laterally inside of the protective walls 63, 63.<br>
[0034]<br>
Since the mounting seats 52, 52 and the protective walls 63, 63 for covering the mounting bolts 59... are formed integrally with the seat receiving portions 54, 54, and the seat receiving portions 54, 54 are arranged on the laterally outs ides of the mounting seats 52, 52 and the mounting bolts 59.. ., the protective walls 63, 63 are formed on the outsides of the mounting seats 52, 52, and protect the mounting seats 52, 52 from the outside.<br>
Since the mounting seats 52, 52 can be protected from the outside, operation of the mounting bolts 59... from the outside by a tool or the like is difficult, whereby the anti-theft effect can be improved.<br>
[0035]<br>
The operation of the grab rail mounting structure according to the present invention will be described.<br>
Referring back to Fig. 4, the seat receiving portion 54 is formed on the laterally outsides of the mounting seat 52 of the grab rail 31 with respect to the vehicle body frame 13 at a level higher than the mounting seat 52, so that the heights of the seat receiving portion 54 and of the mounting seats 52 are offset in the vertical direction.<br>
[0036]<br><br>
When a height T of the head of the grab rail mounting bolt 59 can be kept within an offset amount S by arranging the seat receiving portion 54 and the mounting seats 52 so as to be offset by the offset amount S in the vertical direction, interference between the head 59a of the mounting bolt 5 9 provided on the mounting seat 52 and the seat side members does not occur.<br>
[0037]<br>
Furthermore, since the seat receiving portion 54 is integrally formed at a position higher than the mounting seat 52, the seat receiving portion 54 and the mounting seat 52 can be arranged closer to each other. Since these members can be arranged closer to each other, a space for avoiding interference is not necessary, and hence the space for arranging the seat receiving portion 54 and the mounting seats 52 can be reduced.<br>
[0038]<br>
Although the grab rail mounting structure of the present invention is applied to a motorcycle in this embodiment, it can also be applied to tricycles, and it can be applied to general vehicles without problem. [Industrial Applicability]<br>
[0039]<br>
The grab rail mounting structure of the present invention is suitable for a motorcycle.<br><br>
