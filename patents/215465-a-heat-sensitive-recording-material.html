				<td>The present invention relates to heat sensitive recording materials. It more particularly relates to such recording material in the form of a supporting substrate, for example, a paper sheet, synthetic paper sheet or plastic resin film coated with colour-forming systems comprising a colourless or pale coloured electron donative compound (colour forming compound) and an organic electron acceptor (developer).<br>
Heat sensitive recording has conventionally been used as a system for recording transferred information through the mediation of heat, by utilising a colour reaction between a colour forming compound and a developer.<br>
The properties which are most desirable in a colour forming material, in addition to the      ^<br>
effective development of colour, are thermal response, background whiteness and image    1<br>
stability, especially light fastness of the developed colour, heat and moisture fastness of the/<br>
developed colour, oil fastness of the developed colour, plasticiser resistance of the	1<br>
developed colour and water fastness of the developed colour.	^<br>
A need exists to improve the above properties and to improve the archival capabilities of such recording materials. It is an object of the present invention to provide heat sensitive recording materials with improved properties, especially to provide an increase in image stability whilst improving the background whiteness of the paper before imaging and the background whiteness of the undeveloped portion after imaging.<br>
The present invention is directed to a heat sensitive recording material, comprising<br>

A monophase (or single-phase or guest-host) solid solution possesses a crystal lattice which is identical with the crystal lattice of one of its components. One component is embedded as the "guest" in the crystal lattice of the other component, which acts as the "host". The X-ray diffraction pattern of such a monophase solid solution is substantially identical to that of one of the components, called the "host". Within certain limits, different proportions of the components produce almost identical results.<br>
In the literature, the definitions by the various authors, such as, G.H.Van"t Hoff, A.I.Kitaigorodsky and A.Whitacker for solid solutions and mixed crystals are often contradictory, (cf, e.g. "Analytical Chemistry of Synthetic Dyes", Chapter 10/page 269, Editor K.Venkataraman, J.Wiley, New York, 1977).<br>
The term "monophase solid solution" or "multiphase solid solution" or mixed crystal", as defined herein, therefore, should be taken from the following definitions, which have been adapted to the current improved state of knowledge of such systems: A monophase (or single-phase or guest-host) solid solution possesses a crystal lattice which is identical with the crystal lattice of one of its components. One component is embedded as the "guest" in the crystal lattice of the other component, which acts as the "host". The X-ray diffraction pattern of such a monophase solid solution is substantially identical to that of one of the components, called the "host". Within certain limits, different proportions of the components produce almost identical results.<br>
A multiphase solid solution possesses no precise, uniform crystal lattice. It differs from a physical mixture of its components in that the crystal lattice of at least one of its components is partially or competely altered. In comparison to a physical mixture of the components, which gives an X-ray diffraction diagram that is additive of the diagrams seen for the individual components. The signals in the X-ray diffraction diagram of a multiphase solid solution are broadened, shifted or altered in intensity. In general, different proportions of the components produce different results.<br>
A mixed crystal (or solid compound type) solid solution possesses a precise composition and a uniform crystal lattice, which is different from the crystal lattices of all its components. If<br><br>
different proportions of the components lead, within certain limits, to the same result, then a solid solution is present in which the mixed crystal acts as a host.<br>
For the avoidance of doubt it may also be pointed out that, inter alia, there may also be amorphous structures and mixed aggregates consisting of different particles of different physical type, such as, for example, an aggregate of different components each in pure crystal modification. Such amorphous structures and mixed aggregates cannot be equated with either solid solutions or mixed crystals, and possess different fundamental properties.<br>

The monophase solid solutions can be used singly or as a mixture with other colour forming compounds such as triphenylmethanes, lactones, fluorans, benzoxazines and spiropyrans; or they may also be used together with further black colour forming compounds. Examples of such other colour forming compounds are given hereinbefore.<br>
The monophase solid solutions can be prepared by a variety of methods. One such method is the recrystallisation method wherein a physical mixture of the desired components is dissolved, with or without heating, in a suitable solvent or solvent mixture. Suitable solvents include but are not limited to toluene, benzene, xylene, dichlorobenzene, chlorobenzene, 1,2-dichloroethane, methanol, ethanol, iso-propanol, n-butanol, acetonitrile, dimethylformamide or mixtures of these solvents with each other and with water. The monophase solid solution is then isolated by crystallisation from the solvent or solvent mixture. This can be brought about by cooling, standing, addition of a further solvent to promote crystallisation or concentration by standard means such as distillation, steam distillation and vacuum distillation. When the monophase solid solution is isolated by concentration it may be advantageous to do so in the presence of a small amount of base, to improve the visual aspect of the isolated product.<br>
Alternatively, monophase solid solutions can be prepared from mixtures of the appropriate starting materials. The technique can be used to produce mixtures of two or more fluorans or phthalides. For example, mixtures of two fluorans are produced by replacing a single starting material with two analogous materials to the same total molar concentration in the reaction, in the case of fluorans, these starting materials are derivatives of amino phenols, phthalic anhydrides, keto acids and diphenylamines.<br>

The system of the invention can be employed for other end use applications using colour forming materials, for example, a temperature indicating material.<br>
The quantity of the coating is usually in the range of 2 to 10 g/m^, most often in the range 4 to 8g/m2.<br>
The recording material containing such a thermosensitive colouring layer can in addition contain a protective layer and, if desired, an undercoat layer. The undercoat layer may be interposed between the substrate and the thermosensitive colouring layer.<br>

divided organic powder of, e.g., a urea-formaldehyde resin, a styrene/methacrylic acid copolymer or polystyrene.<br>
The undercoat layer usually contains as its main components a binder resin and a filler.<br>
Specific examples of binder resins for use in the undercoat layer are: polyvinyl alcohol; starch and starch derivatives; cellulose derivatives such as methoxycellulose, hydroxyethyicellulose, carboxymethylcelluiose, methylcellulose and ethylcellulose; sodium polyacrylate; polyvinyl pyrrolidone; polyacrytamide/acrylic acid ester copolymers; acrylamide/acrylic acid ester/methacrylic acid copolymers; alkali metal salts of styrene/maleic anhydride copolymers; alkali metal salts of isobutylene/maleic anhydride copolymers; polyacrylamide; sodium alginate; gelatin; casein; water-soluble polymers such as water-soluble polyesters and carboxyl-group-modified polyvinyl alcohols; polyvinyl acetate; polyurethanes; styrene/butadiene copolymers; polyacrylic acid; polyacrylic acid esters; vinyl chloride/vinyl acetate copolymers; polybutylmethacrylate; ethylen/vinylacetate copolymers and styrene/butadiene acrylic derivative copolymers.<br>
Specific examples of fillers for use in the undercoat layer are:<br>
