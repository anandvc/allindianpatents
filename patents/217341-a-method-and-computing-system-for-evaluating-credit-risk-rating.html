				<td>Field of the invention<br>
This invention relates to a computing system and program product for assessing credit risk rating of a borrower.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Credit risk rating provides for assessing the risk of a borrower failing to meet obligations towards the creditor in accordance with agreed terms and conditions. It is the risk of default on the part of borrower, which could be due to either inability and/or unwillingness to repay debts. Credit risk is associated with individual borrowers. Minimisation of credit risk requires a system to assess and manage the risk associated with individual borrowers. In addition, the terms and conditions of loans and advances sanctioned to a borrower (i.e. the price, the maturity, the form of credit etc.) determine the profit earned by the creditor. If the terms are decided without proper assessment of the credit risk, the creditor incurs losses by charging low interest rates from poor quality customers that default on repayments or charging high rates from good quality customers thereby loosing profitable business to competitors. In the emerging competitive environment a sound credit risk rating system can be a source of competitive advantage for the creditor. The inputs from the credit rating system can also be used for portfolio analysis.<br>
Credit risk depends on both external and internal factors. The external factors can be economy wide as well as company specific.<br>
Some of the economy wide factors are.<br>
	State of the economy<br>
	Wide swings in commodity prices<br>
	Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates<br>
	Trade restrictions<br>
	Economic sanctions<br>
	Government policies, etc.<br><br>
Some company specific factors are: Management expertise Company policies Labour relations<br>
['he internal factors within the creditor set up. influencing credit risk are: Deficiencies in loan policies/administration  Absence-of' prudential credit concentration limits<br>
Inadequately defined lending limits for Loan Officers/Credit Committees    Deficiencies in appraisal of borrowers' financial position<br>
   Excessive dependence on collateral without ascertaining its quality/realisability  Lack of risk pricing mechanisms    Absence of loan review mechanism    Ineffective system of monitoring of accounts<br>
While the creditor can influence and control the internal factors to improve quality of the credit portfolio, the risk due to external factors can be minimised by proper diversification across industries and by initiating necessary changes in the loan portfolio in anticipation of adverse developments. Development of effective risk assessment and monitoring systems helps in improving the quality of credit decisions thereby reducing loan losses on an on-going basis and gradually improving the quality of the loan portfolio.<br>
The main advantages of a credit risk-rating model are: 

The rating primarily assists in the taking of credit decisions, besides creating a database of borrowal accounts. The database, so created, facilitates formulation of policies related to loan approvals, necessity and extent of risk mitigants like collaterals, pricing, monitoring frequency, etc.<br><br>
In particular. Credit risk rating is useful in deciding the following matters:<br>
Whether to lend to a borrower or not: The credit risk rating of a borrower "determines the appetite of the creditor and helps in determining exposure level. A creditor would be willing to lend to highly rated borrowers but would not like exposure to borrowers with very poor credit risk rating.<br>
2.	Pricing: The risk premium to be charged to a borrower is best linked to the credit risk<br>
rating so that borrowers with poor credit rating are priced  high.  Credit rating,<br>
however, is just one amongs several inputs to pricing.<br>
3.	Risk Mitigants: The extent of collateral security required and the need to step up<br>
margin requirements are linked to credit risk rating of a borrower.  The higher the risk<br>
category of a borrower, the greater should be the value of collateral and/or margins.<br>
4.	Level of decision-making: Credit risk rating helps in determining the delegation of<br>
loan sanction/approval powers. For low risk borrowers, the power of approval can be<br>
at the branch level to facilitate faster sanctioning of credits thereby ensuring better<br>
customer service. For higher risk borrowers, approval from higher levels may be<br>
required.<br>
5.	Frequency of renewal and monitoring: Renewal of facility in case of high rated<br>
borrowers can be considered at longer intervals as compared to low rated borrowers.<br>
Further, high-risk borrowers could be monitored on a more frequent basis than the<br>
low risk ones.<br>
Credit risk rating is an important input for making credit decisions, besides other factors like collateral provided, period and quality of relationship with the borrower, portfolio concentration etc.<br>
Credit risk ratings eventually help a creditor to assign a probability of default for a.borrower according to risk category This probability of default is determined statistically from past data by observing the behaviour of  various clients over a number of years. The expected losses from a loan can be determined using this probability of default. This quantitative definition of credit risk helps in taking quality credit decision and its linkage to terms and conditions, amount, interest rate, maturity etc. A database of successive risk ratings, assists in the creating a default probability matrix.<br><br>
The accumulation of data based on individual credit risk rating helps in putting in place scentific pricing mechanism.<br>
The aggregation of credit risk in a creditor's portfolio helps in assessing the capital adequacy of the creditor to take appropriate action and in managing <br>
For banking institutions in particular, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued a<br>
Consultative Paper on New Capital Adequacy framework in June 99 which was intended to<br>
replace the 1998 Accord on international convergence of capital measures and capital<br>
standards. The Committee also brought out guidelines for implementing the new framework.<br>
This accord requires every bank across the world will be required to introduce international<br>
credit risk ratin mechanisms to assess the distribution of various risk rating categories in its<br>
credit portfolio. The resultant aggregation of credit risk rating would be linked to Capital<br>
Adequacy requirements of such institutions. The has defined a time frame<br>
of three years for implementing the new Accord.	<br>
The new Accord interalia stipulates two approaches, namely. Standardised and Internal<br>
Ratina Based Approach.   Under both the approaches, the emphasis is laid on risk rating of<br>
  exposures eitherthrough an external credit rating agency or through an internal mechanism.<br>
Credit   rating for loans of commercial banks is a new concept in India. So far only a few     banks have been conducting credit risk rating exercise and there is no established model to carry out credit risk rating for commercial loans in Indian conditions.<br>
US.patent 6,078.903 describes a method for assessing credit risk which requires estimation of<br><br>
olatility in market value of the borrower's assets to arrive at a projected risk of defaulting on payment of the credit amount. This model makes use of the market value of borrowers assets as reflected by its share price to assess the worth of the borrower's assets accurately - a situation that is not necessarily true in all markets. This model is therefore not applicable to   Further, this model is not useable for those borrowers for whom market data is not available.<br><br>

Fig. 7 shows a flow chart of the Preventive Monitoring System for measurement of<br><br>
the conduct of account.<br>
As shown in figure 1, a computing system for credit risk rating assessment using this invention incorporates a central processing unit (1.1), Display unit (1.2), Secondary Storage (1.3), System Bus (1.4) and Memory (1.5) containing Financial Analysis Means (1.6), Business Position Analysis Means (1.7), Management Performance Analysis Means (1.8), and Preventive Monitoring System (1.9). Also a company-wise audited financials database (1.10) provides the data used by the system for measuring the credit risk rating of clients.<br><br>
Figure 2 shows the data sources for each of the operations. Financial performance analysis (2.3). Business Position analysis (2.4) and Management Performance analysis (2.5). utilize the audited financials of the client obtained from the company-wise audited financials database (2.1) as well as subjective data (2.7. 2.8 and 2.9 respectively) supplied by the individual conducting the credit rating assessment. The conduct of account analysis (2.6) however is on the basis of the Preventive Monitoring System database (2.2) relating to the conduct of the account for each client. In addition, subjective data (2.10) is provided by the credit risk rating assessor. The movement of the PMS Index influences the credit risk rating of the client.<br>
The top level flow chart of the operation of the Credit Risk Rating System is shown in Figure 3. The credit risk rating assessor initially identifies a peer group considering all the industry segments in which the client operates (3.1). The system then extracts the peer group data (3.2) from the company-wise audited financials database and generates peer group performance measurement parameter values (3.3). A financial performance analysis is then conducted (3.4) against peer group relative parameters as well as absolute benchmark parameters using the client's audited financials data obtained from the company-wise audited financials database duly adjusted for future risk, trend evaluation &amp; subjective assessment of financials. This analysis yields a score-A value. The business position of the client is then evaluated (3.5) against some peer group relative parameters to provide a business position score, which is adjusted for industry prospects to get Score - B. the Management performance is assessed (3.6) against defined performance parameters to generate score-C. The conduct of the client account is quantitatively measured (3.7) using the Preventive Monitoring System against defined parameters using the data obtained from the operations of the clients' account, to evaluate score-D. Finally, the 4 scores (Score-A. Score-B. score-C and score-D) are aggregated to generate the final rating (3.8).<br>
Figure 4 shows a flow chart defining the operation of the financial analysis system. A peer group comparison is conducted (4.1) with the selected peer group using the identified financial ratios listed below.<br><br>
Parameter<br>
Gross Sales Growth Rate (%)<br>
OPBDIT / Sales (%)<br>
Short term Bank Borrowings / Net Sales (%)<br>
Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt (%)<br>
Net Operating Cash Flow /Total Debt (%)<br>
The Gross Sales growth rate of the company -is based on compounded annual growth rate ever the past three years.<br>
An absolute comparison of financial performance is conducted (4.2) on 6 key financial ratios<br>
against specified benchmark values as shown below:	<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
A Subjective Assessment of the clients  financials is carried out (4.3). The purpose of subjective assessment of financials is to make an analysis of the reliability of financials furnished in the audited balance sheet. The analysis is done on the following four parameters.<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
transparency in Accounting is assessed with relevance to the clients" maintenance of accounts, accounting principles, auditor's qualifying remarks and such other factors, which are quantified and the impact thereof on the company's net worth is evaluated.<br>
The Quality of inventory and Readability of debtors data, assesses the extent of realisable value of inventory &amp; debtors in comparison to the book value. The purpose of such evaluation is to assess the likelihood of deterioration in clients' financials. if any.<br>
The Quality of Investment is assessed on the following three parameters in sequential order<br>
1	Quantum of Investment in comparison to the Net Worth<br>
2	Market value of such investments in comparison to book value, erosion if any and its<br>
impact on net worth<br>
3	Return on such investment in comparison to market return.<br>
The aggregate score obtained is used to discount the previous scores using a discounting matrix as shown below:<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br><br>
The  trends  of the  following  4  parameters  are  evaluated  (4.4)  to  assess  the  client's performance in the last three years.<br>
TREND ADJUSTMENT<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
The above parameters are evaluated in terms of direction, magnitude and variability.<br>
The following factors are evaluated to assess the future risk aspects (4.5) of the client's financials.<br><br>
Future Risk: Parameter<br>
Impact of Contingent Liability<br>
Foreign Exchange Risk<br>
Impact of merger/demerger/expansion on key financials<br>
Cash flow adequacy<br>
Impact of diversion on future financials<br>
Impact of Contingent Liability is assessed with reference to the aggregate contingent liability &amp; the likely devolvement of such liability. The quantification of such contingent liabilities are compared to the clients' net worth to determine possible impact.<br>
The Foreign Exchange Risk, is assessed from the aspect of transaction risk and the portfolio risk and is further quantified and analysed with respect to unhedged exposure and its possible impact on net worth.<br>
The Impact of merger / demerger is evaluated on the basis of three key financial ratios:<br>
•	Current Ratio<br>
•	Debt/Equity ratio<br>
•	ROCE<br>
The assessment is in terms of the likely ratios that may emerge at the end of the rating period compared with absolute benchmark values.<br>
On Diversion of Funds, the purpose is only to identify the reason for such diversion, as the quantum of diversion is already evaluated in the absolute comparison parameters. The purpose of the diversion of fund impacts the future risk.<br>
The aggregate weighted score of parameters under peer group assessment and absolute assessment is discounted by the subjective assessment and then further discounted by the trend assessment scores. The score so obtained is aggregated with the score under future risk assessment to arrive at score A on weighted average.<br><br>
BUSINESS<br>
The Business Position Assessment is conducted in terms of the Operating Efficiency and Market Position. Operating Efficiency is evaluated with respect to the peer group (5.1) based on 11 parameters of which the assessor selects the most relevant 5 parameters applicable to the industry in which the client operates. The data for comparison is derived from the peer group data.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
* Only five out of eleven parameters are to be selected, while operating leverage is compulsory, any four other parameters are to be chosen. All parameters carry equal weight.<br>
The Market position of the client is assessed (5.2) on the basis of important / relevant parameters out of the 7 listed below. Each main parameter is derived from sub parameters that are rated individually with the assessor exercising the discretion of selecting the most appropriate sub parameters. The evaluation of each sub-parameter is done from the perspective of the client's position vis-a-vis the peer/industry in which the client operates. The average value / score of all the sub parameters determines the score for the main parameter.<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
Assessor is required to select most important parameters/ factors applicable to the industry segment being evaluated. All the parameters/ factors within the parameters carry equal weight. Assessor can select any number of factors and can add up to two additional factors under each parameter.<br>
The weighted average of the two scores shown above are adjusted for industry score, as per matrix below to determine score-B.<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
The evaluation of Management Performance is based on both objective and subjective analysis.<br>
The objective evaluation is performed (6.1) to determine the capability of management to achieve the budgeted sales &amp; profits. The subjective evaluation (6.2) assesses the willingness of the management and its capability to run the company on the basis of 7 parameters:<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The weighted average of all the parameters determines score-C (6.3)<br>
Figure 7 shows the Preventive Monitroring System (PMS) for measuring the Conduct of Account. The PMS scrutinizes the clients conduct of account database for the previous one year period to identify negative factors under 10 categories.<br>
Each category includes several parameters that are individually measured based on available data. The score against each parameter is aggregated for the past one year period (7.11). the parameter with the maximum aggregate score is selected from each category (7.12) and its score is used to represent the category (7.13). The scores of all the categories are totalled (7.14) to arrive at the PMS Index Score (7.15). which corresponds to a PMS Rank (7.16). The PMS Rank is finally converted to a PMS rating score (7.17).<br>
Score under A to D will be aggregated on the weighted average basis as under:<br>
Parameter<br>
Parameter	weight   <br>
Financial strength	40 %     <br>
Business &amp; industry	30 %     <br>
Management	20 %	<br>
Conduct of account	10%	<br>

['he internal factors within the creditor set up. influencing credit risk are: Deficiencies in loan policies/administration  Absence-of' prudential credit concentration limits<br>
Inadequately defined lending limits for Loan Officers/Credit Committees    Deficiencies in appraisal of borrowers' financial position<br>
   Excessive dependence on collateral without ascertaining its quality/realisability  Lack of risk pricing mechanisms    Absence of loan review mechanism    Ineffective system of monitoring of accounts<br>
While the creditor can influence and control the internal factors to improve quality of the credit portfolio, the risk due to external factors can be minimised by proper diversification across industries and by initiating necessary changes in the loan portfolio in anticipation of adverse developments. Development of effective risk assessment and monitoring systems helps in improving the quality of credit decisions thereby reducing loan losses on an on-going basis and gradually improving the quality of the loan portfolio.<br>
The main advantages of a credit risk-rating model are: 

The rating primarily assists in the taking of credit decisions, besides creating a database of borrowal accounts. The database, so created, facilitates formulation of policies related to loan approvals, necessity and extent of risk mitigants like collaterals, pricing, monitoring frequency, etc.<br><br>
In particular. Credit risk rating is useful in deciding the following matters:<br>
Whether to lend to a borrower or not: The credit risk rating of a borrower "determines the appetite of the creditor and helps in determining exposure level. A creditor would be willing to lend to highly rated borrowers but would not like exposure to borrowers with very poor credit risk rating.<br>
2.	Pricing: The risk premium to be charged to a borrower is best linked to the credit risk<br>
rating so that borrowers with poor credit rating are priced  high.  Credit rating,<br>
however, is just one amongs several inputs to pricing.<br>
3.	Risk Mitigants: The extent of collateral security required and the need to step up<br>
margin requirements are linked to credit risk rating of a borrower.  The higher the risk<br>
category of a borrower, the greater should be the value of collateral and/or margins.<br>
4.	Level of decision-making: Credit risk rating helps in determining the delegation of<br>
loan sanction/approval powers. For low risk borrowers, the power of approval can be<br>
at the branch level to facilitate faster sanctioning of credits thereby ensuring better<br>
customer service. For higher risk borrowers, approval from higher levels may be<br>
required.<br>
5.	Frequency of renewal and monitoring: Renewal of facility in case of high rated<br>
borrowers can be considered at longer intervals as compared to low rated borrowers.<br>
Further, high-risk borrowers could be monitored on a more frequent basis than the<br>
low risk ones.<br>
Credit risk rating is an important input for making credit decisions, besides other factors like collateral provided, period and quality of relationship with the borrower, portfolio concentration etc.<br>
Credit risk ratings eventually help a creditor to assign a probability of default for a.borrower according to risk category This probability of default is determined statistically from past data by observing the behaviour of  various clients over a number of years. The expected losses from a loan can be determined using this probability of default. This quantitative definition of credit risk helps in taking quality credit decision and its linkage to terms and conditions, amount, interest rate, maturity etc. A database of successive risk ratings, assists in the creating a default probability matrix.<br><br>
The accumulation of data based on individual credit risk rating helps in putting in place scentific pricing mechanism.<br>
The aggregation of credit risk in a creditor's portfolio helps in assessing the capital adequacy of the creditor to take appropriate action and in managing <br>
For banking institutions in particular, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued a<br>
Consultative Paper on New Capital Adequacy framework in June 99 which was intended to<br>
replace the 1998 Accord on international convergence of capital measures and capital<br>
standards. The Committee also brought out guidelines for implementing the new framework.<br>
This accord requires every bank across the world will be required to introduce international<br>
credit risk ratin mechanisms to assess the distribution of various risk rating categories in its<br>
credit portfolio. The resultant aggregation of credit risk rating would be linked to Capital<br>
Adequacy requirements of such institutions. The has defined a time frame<br>
of three years for implementing the new Accord.	<br>
The new Accord interalia stipulates two approaches, namely. Standardised and Internal<br>
Ratina Based Approach.   Under both the approaches, the emphasis is laid on risk rating of<br>
  exposures eitherthrough an external credit rating agency or through an internal mechanism.<br>
Credit   rating for loans of commercial banks is a new concept in India. So far only a few     banks have been conducting credit risk rating exercise and there is no established model to carry out credit risk rating for commercial loans in Indian conditions.<br>
US.patent 6,078.903 describes a method for assessing credit risk which requires estimation of<br><br>
olatility in market value of the borrower's assets to arrive at a projected risk of defaulting on payment of the credit amount. This model makes use of the market value of borrowers assets as reflected by its share price to assess the worth of the borrower's assets accurately - a situation that is not necessarily true in all markets. This model is therefore not applicable to   Further, this model is not useable for those borrowers for whom market data is not available.<br><br>

Fig. 7 shows a flow chart of the Preventive Monitoring System for measurement of<br><br>
the conduct of account.<br>
As shown in figure 1, a computing system for credit risk rating assessment using this invention incorporates a central processing unit (1.1), Display unit (1.2), Secondary Storage (1.3), System Bus (1.4) and Memory (1.5) containing Financial Analysis Means (1.6), Business Position Analysis Means (1.7), Management Performance Analysis Means (1.8), and Preventive Monitoring System (1.9). Also a company-wise audited financials database (1.10) provides the data used by the system for measuring the credit risk rating of clients.<br><br>
Figure 2 shows the data sources for each of the operations. Financial performance analysis (2.3). Business Position analysis (2.4) and Management Performance analysis (2.5). utilize the audited financials of the client obtained from the company-wise audited financials database (2.1) as well as subjective data (2.7. 2.8 and 2.9 respectively) supplied by the individual conducting the credit rating assessment. The conduct of account analysis (2.6) however is on the basis of the Preventive Monitoring System database (2.2) relating to the conduct of the account for each client. In addition, subjective data (2.10) is provided by the credit risk rating assessor. The movement of the PMS Index influences the credit risk rating of the client.<br>
The top level flow chart of the operation of the Credit Risk Rating System is shown in Figure 3. The credit risk rating assessor initially identifies a peer group considering all the industry segments in which the client operates (3.1). The system then extracts the peer group data (3.2) from the company-wise audited financials database and generates peer group performance measurement parameter values (3.3). A financial performance analysis is then conducted (3.4) against peer group relative parameters as well as absolute benchmark parameters using the client's audited financials data obtained from the company-wise audited financials database duly adjusted for future risk, trend evaluation &amp; subjective assessment of financials. This analysis yields a score-A value. The business position of the client is then evaluated (3.5) against some peer group relative parameters to provide a business position score, which is adjusted for industry prospects to get Score - B. the Management performance is assessed (3.6) against defined performance parameters to generate score-C. The conduct of the client account is quantitatively measured (3.7) using the Preventive Monitoring System against defined parameters using the data obtained from the operations of the clients' account, to evaluate score-D. Finally, the 4 scores (Score-A. Score-B. score-C and score-D) are aggregated to generate the final rating (3.8).<br>
Figure 4 shows a flow chart defining the operation of the financial analysis system. A peer group comparison is conducted (4.1) with the selected peer group using the identified financial ratios listed below.<br><br>
Parameter<br>
Gross Sales Growth Rate (%)<br>
OPBDIT / Sales (%)<br>
Short term Bank Borrowings / Net Sales (%)<br>
Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt (%)<br>
Net Operating Cash Flow /Total Debt (%)<br>
The Gross Sales growth rate of the company -is based on compounded annual growth rate ever the past three years.<br>
An absolute comparison of financial performance is conducted (4.2) on 6 key financial ratios<br>
against specified benchmark values as shown below:	<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
A Subjective Assessment of the clients  financials is carried out (4.3). The purpose of subjective assessment of financials is to make an analysis of the reliability of financials furnished in the audited balance sheet. The analysis is done on the following four parameters.<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
transparency in Accounting is assessed with relevance to the clients" maintenance of accounts, accounting principles, auditor's qualifying remarks and such other factors, which are quantified and the impact thereof on the company's net worth is evaluated.<br>
The Quality of inventory and Readability of debtors data, assesses the extent of realisable value of inventory &amp; debtors in comparison to the book value. The purpose of such evaluation is to assess the likelihood of deterioration in clients' financials. if any.<br>
The Quality of Investment is assessed on the following three parameters in sequential order<br>
1	Quantum of Investment in comparison to the Net Worth<br>
2	Market value of such investments in comparison to book value, erosion if any and its<br>
impact on net worth<br>
3	Return on such investment in comparison to market return.<br>
The aggregate score obtained is used to discount the previous scores using a discounting matrix as shown below:<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br><br>
The  trends  of the  following  4  parameters  are  evaluated  (4.4)  to  assess  the  client's performance in the last three years.<br>
TREND ADJUSTMENT<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
The above parameters are evaluated in terms of direction, magnitude and variability.<br>
The following factors are evaluated to assess the future risk aspects (4.5) of the client's financials.<br><br>
Future Risk: Parameter<br>
Impact of Contingent Liability<br>
Foreign Exchange Risk<br>
Impact of merger/demerger/expansion on key financials<br>
Cash flow adequacy<br>
Impact of diversion on future financials<br>
Impact of Contingent Liability is assessed with reference to the aggregate contingent liability &amp; the likely devolvement of such liability. The quantification of such contingent liabilities are compared to the clients' net worth to determine possible impact.<br>
The Foreign Exchange Risk, is assessed from the aspect of transaction risk and the portfolio risk and is further quantified and analysed with respect to unhedged exposure and its possible impact on net worth.<br>
The Impact of merger / demerger is evaluated on the basis of three key financial ratios:<br>
•	Current Ratio<br>
•	Debt/Equity ratio<br>
•	ROCE<br>
The assessment is in terms of the likely ratios that may emerge at the end of the rating period compared with absolute benchmark values.<br>
On Diversion of Funds, the purpose is only to identify the reason for such diversion, as the quantum of diversion is already evaluated in the absolute comparison parameters. The purpose of the diversion of fund impacts the future risk.<br>
The aggregate weighted score of parameters under peer group assessment and absolute assessment is discounted by the subjective assessment and then further discounted by the trend assessment scores. The score so obtained is aggregated with the score under future risk assessment to arrive at score A on weighted average.<br><br>
BUSINESS<br>
The Business Position Assessment is conducted in terms of the Operating Efficiency and Market Position. Operating Efficiency is evaluated with respect to the peer group (5.1) based on 11 parameters of which the assessor selects the most relevant 5 parameters applicable to the industry in which the client operates. The data for comparison is derived from the peer group data.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
* Only five out of eleven parameters are to be selected, while operating leverage is compulsory, any four other parameters are to be chosen. All parameters carry equal weight.<br>
The Market position of the client is assessed (5.2) on the basis of important / relevant parameters out of the 7 listed below. Each main parameter is derived from sub parameters that are rated individually with the assessor exercising the discretion of selecting the most appropriate sub parameters. The evaluation of each sub-parameter is done from the perspective of the client's position vis-a-vis the peer/industry in which the client operates. The average value / score of all the sub parameters determines the score for the main parameter.<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
Assessor is required to select most important parameters/ factors applicable to the industry segment being evaluated. All the parameters/ factors within the parameters carry equal weight. Assessor can select any number of factors and can add up to two additional factors under each parameter.<br>
The weighted average of the two scores shown above are adjusted for industry score, as per matrix below to determine score-B.<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
The evaluation of Management Performance is based on both objective and subjective analysis.<br>
The objective evaluation is performed (6.1) to determine the capability of management to achieve the budgeted sales &amp; profits. The subjective evaluation (6.2) assesses the willingness of the management and its capability to run the company on the basis of 7 parameters:<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The weighted average of all the parameters determines score-C (6.3)<br>
Figure 7 shows the Preventive Monitroring System (PMS) for measuring the Conduct of Account. The PMS scrutinizes the clients conduct of account database for the previous one year period to identify negative factors under 10 categories.<br>
Each category includes several parameters that are individually measured based on available data. The score against each parameter is aggregated for the past one year period (7.11). the parameter with the maximum aggregate score is selected from each category (7.12) and its score is used to represent the category (7.13). The scores of all the categories are totalled (7.14) to arrive at the PMS Index Score (7.15). which corresponds to a PMS Rank (7.16). The PMS Rank is finally converted to a PMS rating score (7.17).<br>
Score under A to D will be aggregated on the weighted average basis as under:<br>
Parameter<br>
Parameter	weight   <br>
Financial strength	40 %     <br>
Business &amp; industry	30 %     <br>
Management	20 %	<br>
Conduct of account	10%	<br>
