				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to managing accounting-related data in a computer network.<br>
More specifically, the invention relates to automatically generating processing-optimized<br>
and redundancy-free data for multiple applications.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The volume of accounting-related data that is permanently generated and that has to be<br>
regularly managed and evaluated necessitates even in small-size businesses the implemen-<br>
tation of computer-assisted mechanisms. In larger businesses accounting-related data are<br>
sometimes generated by dozens of individual software applications often running on dif-<br>
ferent technical platforms.<br>
Especially in larger businesses a single data processing (e.g. reporting) mechanism is not<br>
sufficient for efficiently controlling all operations. Hence, different data processing<br>
mechanism delivering different output data including required operational information are<br>
commonly deployed. Although the data processing mechanisms differ with respect to the<br>
generated information, they are usually based on the same or at least similar accounting-<br>
related data received from the individual software applications.<br>
This situation is schematically depicted in Fig. 1. In the scenario of Fig. 1 four software<br>
applications are running in parallel in different computer networks 10,12,14 and 16. Each<br>
computer network 10,12,14,16 comprises a central component (like an application server<br>
or a mainframe computer) and several terminal devices like clients, presentation servers,<br>
automatic teller machines (ATMs), etc. attached to the central component. Data received<br>
from the terminal devices is converted by the applications running on the central compo-<br>
nents into accounting-related data.<br>
As illustrated for computer networks 10,12 and 14 (applications 1, 2 and 3), the account-<br>
ing-related data generated by the individual applications are transferred to central applica-<br>
tion servers 18,20 for being processed further. More specifically, each of the central<br>
application servers 18,20 applies a particular processing mechanism to the accounting-<br>
related data that are received from the computer networks 10,12,14 and produces output<br>
data that may be used for various operational purposes. Processing instructions data to be<br>
used by the different processing mechanisms applied by the central application servers<br>
18,20 are stored in local data bases REF 1 and REF 2 belonging to the central application<br>
servers 18,20, respectively.<br>
The multiplicity of central application servers 18,20 and associated input data streams is<br>
necessitated by the fact that different processing mechanisms (applications) are in charge<br>
of generating the output data. These different processing mechanisms, although processing<br>
very similar accounting-related data, usually require different input data formats or process<br>
different informational contents included in the accounting-related data. As examples for<br>
processing mechanisms that are performed in parallel and on the basis of similar account-<br>
ing-related data the mechanisms of management accounting and financial accounting can<br>
be mentioned. The first central application server 18 may thus for example be in charge of<br>
management accounting applying accounting principles REF 1 to generate data set 1 (e.g.<br>
in a management reporting context) and the second central application server 20 may be in<br>
charge of financial accounting applying accounting principles REF 2 to generate data set 2<br>
(e.g. for the computerized preparation of balance sheets and associated reporting).<br>
As illustrated for computer network 16 (application 4), the accounting-related data may be<br>
pre-processed locally within a particular network according to a processing mechanism<br>
using instruction data stored in a local network data base REF 3 to generate a pre-<br>
processed data set 3. In some cases the accounting-related data or the pre-processed data<br>
set 3 generated within one computer network 16 may additionally (or alternatively) be<br>
transferred to another computer network 14 for further data processing before being trans-<br>
ferred to one or both of central applications servers 18,20.<br>
From Fig. 1 it becomes apparent that the complexity of the data processing system as a<br>
whole is high. Thus, the maintenance of the system is difficult. Moreover, lack of integra-<br>
tion and lack of automation often requires manual interactions, e.g. duplicate data entries,<br>
as well as data conversions and data transfer processes. Also, the data throughput is slow,<br>
especially if sequential data processing as illustrated for computer networks 14 and 16 is<br>
performed. The low data throughput implies that the closing process for reporting, e.g. for<br>
providing specific accumulated information, takes a very long time. Currently, detailed<br>
accounting reports can very often not be provided until 15 days and more after a specified<br>
date like the end of the month. In this context it has to be kept in mind that in larger busi-<br>
nesses hundreds of millions of individual data sets have to be evaluated every month.<br>
Accounting-related data generated by the individual computer networks 10,12,14,16 as<br>
well as output data generated by the central application servers 18,20 have to be stored<br>
simultaneously in two or more memory locations (e.g. locally at the sites of each of the<br>
two central application servers 18,20), leading to a high informational redundancy. This<br>
adds to the hardware requirements and in particular to the storage costs.<br>
A further problem associated with redundant data storage is data authentication. If the<br>
same information is simultaneously stored in two or more memory locations, the provision<br>
of authenticated data for e.g. official reporting purposes becomes a difficult task and re-<br>
quires constant, and often manual, data reconciliation as indicated in Fig. 1 with an arrow<br>
between central application servers 18,20.<br>
One solution to the drawbacks of the scenario depicted in Fig. 1 might be to somehow<br>
integrate the functions of the two central application servers 18,20 and the central compo-<br>
nent of the computer network 16. However, in view of the fact that the different processing<br>
mechanisms usually operate on different data and different data formats, such an approach<br>
would still involve redundant data storage, and thus complex data authentication mecha-<br>
nisms.<br>
There is a need for a network component, a network system, a method, a computer pro-<br>
gram product and a data structure which, in the context outlined above, allow on the one<br>
hand for a redundancy-free provision of data for different processing requirements and<br>
which on the other hand facilitate data authentication. Furthermore, there is a desire to<br>
accelerate the provision of accumulated data when large amounts of data have to be han-<br>
dled.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
This need is satisfied according to the invention by a network component for transforming<br>
accounting-related data sets into multi-dimensional data sets which are used to update a<br>
data base that is jointly used by different processing mechanisms like financial and man-<br>
agement accounting mechanisms to provide report data sets. The network component in-<br>
cludes at least one a master data base for storing master data including static data and a<br>
multi-dimensional generic data template. The data template specifies a plurality of pre-<br>
defined data fields (or contents) relating to elementary information that is to be processed<br>
by the different processing mechanisms. The network component further comprises at least<br>
one interface for receiving the accounting-related data sets from a plurality of individual<br>
sub-systems. Furthermore, the network component comprises processing resources with<br>
access to the master data base. The processing resources are programmable to generate<br>
for each accounting-related data set one or more multi-dimensional data sets by deriving<br>
the elementary information included in the accounting-related data set and in associated<br>
static data and by writing the derived elementary information in the appropriate data fields<br>
specified by the data template. The elementary information included in the multi-<br>
dimensional data sets is used to update an elementary data base that is jointly used by the<br>
different processing mechanisms.<br>
According to the invention, all the information required by the different processing<br>
mechanisms can be generated along a single processing chain. Thus, an output-oriented<br>
topology is realized that strongly reduces redundancies and makes reconciliation efforts<br>
obsolete. The information derived from a specific accounting-related data set (primary data<br>
set) and from associated static data is included on an elementary level in one or more<br>
multi-dimensional data sets (secondary data sets) that form the basis for updating the ele-<br>
mentary data base. In contrast to the variable accounting-related data sets which are con-<br>
tinuously generated for individual transactions, static data are fixed or change only slowly.<br>
The static data may include information that is required for generating the multi-<br>
dimensional data set but that is not or not explicitly included in the accounting-related data<br>
set. Thus, the provision of static data in the master data base helps to reduce network traf-<br>
fic, i.e. the amount of data that has to be transferred from the sub-systems to the network<br>
component because certain generic data common to several accounting-related data sets<br>
need not to be transferred with each accounting-related data set to the network component.<br>
It usually suffices to simply include a short reference to specific static data into the ac-<br>
counting-related data set transferred to the network component and the network compo-<br>
nent itself may then "complete" (enrich) the received accounting-relating data set by the<br>
associated static data for the purpose of deriving the elementary information required for<br>
generating the one or more multi-dimensional data sets.<br>
The static (and reference) data included in the one or more master data bases may be iden-<br>
tical with the static (and reference) data utilized by source applications generating the ac-<br>
counting-related data sets. If required, these source applications may have access to the<br>
one or more master data bases. The latter approach helps to further reduce data redundan-<br>
cies.<br>
The transformation of the accounting-related data sets into multi-dimensional data sets<br>
may be based on technical identifiers that have a 1:1 association with identifiers provided<br>
by the source application. In the case of a plurality of n source application. In the case of a<br>
plurality of n source applications, a 1 :n association would exist. The tables underlying<br>
these associations may thus be considered as lexical ontologies.<br>
Due to the highly granular nature of the multi-dimensional data sets and their complete-<br>
ness as regards the informational content required by the different processing mechanisms<br>
they may form the basis for updating the elementary data base that is jointly used by the<br>
different processing mechanisms. Furthermore, redundant data storage is avoided because<br>
the elementary data base serves as common data base for all processing mechanisms. Ad-<br>
ditionally, data authentication ambiguities do no longer occur since the elementary data<br>
base can be regarded as the single source for providing authenticated data. Thus, recon-<br>
ciliation processes as illustrated between the application servers 18,20 in Fig. 1 can be<br>
dispensed with.<br>
The conventional differentiation between balancing data warehousing on the one hand and<br>
data warehousing for reporting purposes on the other hand becomes obsolete by the inte-<br>
grated solution provided by the elementary data base. The elementary data base thus con-<br>
stitutes an integrated source for different types of reports including search and drill down<br>
mechanisms on e.g. balance sheet data (daily, weekly, etc.), profit center data, etc.<br>
The elementary data base may include elementary data sets that at least partially corre-<br>
spond to the data fields of the data template. The elementary data sets may be created or<br>
changed by the processing resources in context with updating the elementary data base<br>
upon generation of new multi-dimensional data sets. The processing resources may thus be<br>
programmed to update the elementary data base by accumulating elementary information<br>
included for example in one or more particular data fields of the multi-dimensional data<br>
sets onto elementary data sets that are already existing in the elementary data base or that<br>
have to be newly created. Updating of the elementary data base may be performed batch-<br>
wise or in a continuous manner. According to a preferred continuous updating approach,<br>
the elementary data base is updated asynchronously as soon as one or more further multi-<br>
dimensional data sets have been generated.<br>
In order to control the updating process, the processing resources may be programmed to<br>
assign one or more control attributes to the multi-dimensional data sets. Control attribute<br>
types which are to be assigned to a multi-dimensional data set may be specified by the<br>
generic data template and may be inserted or already be included in one or more data<br>
fields of the multi-dimensional data sets.<br>
Based on the one or more control attributes assigned to a particular multi-dimensional data<br>
set, the elementary information included in this multi-dimensional data set can be accumu-<br>
lated onto elementary data sets related to the control attributes. In other words, the control<br>
attributes may indicate the particular elementary data set onto which the elementary infor-<br>
mation included in a multi-dimensional data set is to be accumulated, e.g. appended or<br>
added.<br>
The particular elementary data set onto which particular elementary information is to be<br>
accumulated may be derived based on two or more control attributes. The individual con-<br>
trol attributes may be independent from each other and may thus span a multi-dimensional<br>
space. A single control attribute may often not be sufficient to unambiguously identify the<br>
particular elementary data set onto which the elementary information is to be accumulated.<br>
Also, the control attributes associated with the received accounting-related data sets may<br>
be changing so that the particular elementary data set may be identified only on the basis<br>
of the available control attributes received via the accounting-related data set.<br>
Thus the plurality of control attributes received via an accounting-related data set may be<br>
required to identify the relevant storage portion (elementary data set) onto which the ele-<br>
mentary information included in a multi-dimensional data set is to be accumulated.<br>
The control attributes may relate to various aspects. For example, a control attribute in the<br>
form of an identification code identifying e.g. a customer, a customer position, an organ-<br>
izational entity serving the customer or the like may be assigned. Thus, the elementary<br>
information pertaining to this assignment can be accumulated onto the particular elemen-<br>
tary data set related to this assignment.<br>
Control attributes of the types specified by the generic data template or different therefrom<br>
may also be included in the elementary data sets to assist the tasks of the individual proc-<br>
essing mechanisms generating the reporting data sets. The control attributes associated<br>
with the elementary data sets may for example contain structural information required to<br>
produce report data sets in the form of balance sheets or management accounting reports.<br>
The elementary data sets may be evaluated individually for each of the multiple dimen-<br>
sions reflected therein. Accordingly, report data sets may be generated for an individual<br>
dimension (attribute) of the elementary data sets.<br>
The control attributes associated with the elementary data sets may be included in or ap-<br>
pended to the elementary data sets and may at least in part be identical with or correspond<br>
to control attributes assigned to the multi-dimensional data sets.<br>
In order to enable a tracking of the information flow, one or more of the elementary data<br>
sets stored in the elementary data base may be linked with at least one of related multi-<br>
dimensional data sets and related accounting-related data sets. In the context of the present<br>
invention a related multi-dimensional data set or accounting-related data set is defined as a<br>
data set that includes or is the source of information accumulated onto the elementary data<br>
set. Linking an elementary data set with a related data set may be performed in various<br>
ways like by appending to the elementary data set information about the memory location<br>
of the related data sets or vice-versa.<br>
To cope with authorization problems, the elementary data base may be configured as the<br>
only source for providing information for generating the report data sets. This may imply<br>
that the different processing mechanisms generate the report data sets solely on the basis of<br>
the information included in the elementary data base. To enhance data integrity, the ele-<br>
mentary data base may be configured as a read-only data base with respect to all accesses<br>
different from updating.<br>
Besides the elementary data base and the master data base the network component may<br>
further comprise an entry data base that serves for storing the accounting-related sets re-<br>
ceived via the interface from the individual sub-systems. The accounting related data sets<br>
received from the sub-systems may all have the same format or may have individual for-<br>
mats characteristic of the individual applications that generated the accounting-related data<br>
sets. Especially when the accounting-related data sets are received in different formats, a<br>
data sourcing component may be provided to format the received accounting-related data<br>
sets and to write the formatted accounting-related data sets into the entry data base. Such<br>
an approach allows to provide the individual accounting-relating data sets in a pre-defined<br>
format to the processing resources generating the multi-dimensional data sets.<br>
The data sourcing component may alternatively or additionally be configured to check the<br>
accounting-related data sets received from the sub-systems to determine data inconsisten-<br>
cies. Mechanisms may be provided to handle exceptions in the case of inconsistencies of<br>
one or more of the accounting-related data sets. In the case of inconsistencies, the data<br>
sourcing component may for example re-format a received accounting-related data set or<br>
notify an individual sub-system that a received accounting-related data set is not accepted,<br>
thus triggering a re-transmission of the accounting-related data set or of a complete file<br>
containing the accounting-related data set.<br>
Additionally, the network component may comprise an item data base for storing the<br>
multi-dimensional data sets that were generated by the first processor from the accounting-<br>
related data sets. Thus, the item data base may be regarded as an intermediate data base<br>
arranged between the entry data base that stores the accounting-related data sets and the<br>
elementary data base that stores the elementary data sets. The provision of three individual<br>
data bases (that may physically be located on a single hardware component) is advanta-<br>
geous because it allows at any point in time to trace back the information as it proceeded<br>
in different formats from the individual sub-systems to the various processing mecha-<br>
nisms. In particular, it allows to determine the origin of data inconsistencies that in many<br>
cases can only be detected at the very end of the data stream, i.e. when applying individual<br>
processing mechanisms to the data stored in the elementary data base. In order to further<br>
facilitate the tracking of information, the multi-dimensional data sets stored in the item<br>
data base may be linked with at least one of the associated accounting-related data sets<br>
stored in the entry data base and one or more of the associated elementary data sets stored<br>
in the elementary data base.<br>
As has been mentioned above, the elementary data base, as well as the master data base or<br>
any other system data base or combination thereof, may jointly be used by the different<br>
processing mechanisms. The processing mechanisms may be performed by dedicated or<br>
shared processing resources. The processing mechanisms are configured to generate report<br>
data sets based on the elementary data sets and, optionally, based on the multi-dimensional<br>
data sets. In general, report generation relies on report structure information (report defini-<br>
tion data), that may be contained in the master data base, and on appropriate data extracts<br>
from the elementary data base or, optionally, any other system data base or combination<br>
thereof. Thus, the one or more processing mechanisms may be configured to extract se-<br>
lected elementary data sets stored in the elementary data base for reporting purposes. The<br>
report definition data may specify how information included in the extracted elementary<br>
data sets has to be accumulated or evaluated.<br>
One or more processing mechanisms may also be configured to extract selected elemen-<br>
tary data sets stored in the elementary data base for evaluation purposes. Based on that,<br>
additional processing mechanisms might be in place to provide evaluation results by ap-<br>
plying pre-defined evaluation criteria and to generate at least one of multi-dimensional<br>
data sets and accounting-related data sets, in particular if the actual values of elementary<br>
data sets differ from values originally extracted. The resulting multi-dimensional data sets<br>
may be used by a subsequent processing mechanism to update the elementary data sets.<br>
The processing mechanisms may be based on a set of processing instruction data, e.g. sets<br>
of values and rules which have to be applied on the data to be processed to generate the<br>
multi-dimensional data sets, the elementary data sets or the multi-dimensional data sets.<br>
The processing instruction data may be kept outside of the program code of a particular<br>
processing mechanism (soft coded approach) or could be part of the program code (hard<br>
coded approach). If a soft coded approach is implemented, the processing instruction data<br>
may be included as reference data in the static data stored in the master data base. This has<br>
the advantage that changes to e.g. table entries on reference data are independent from<br>
program code changes.<br>
The processing resources may be programmed to execute at least one processing mecha-<br>
nism to transform an accounting-related data set into one or more multi-dimensional data<br>
sets using static data associated with the accounting-related data set. When performing the<br>
transformation the processing resources derive the elementary information included in the<br>
accounting-related data set and in any static data associated with the accounting-related<br>
data set and write the elementary information thus derived in the corresponding data fields<br>
specified by the data template, thus assembling the one or more multi-dimensional data<br>
sets. The processing mechanism may indicate how the data template is to be applied. The<br>
processing mechanism may for example derive the control attributes to be assigned to a<br>
particular multi-dimensional data set, determine the particular static data associated with<br>
the accounting-related data set, etc. Processing instruction data specific for the processing<br>
mechanisms applied to transform the accounting-related data sets into the multi-<br>
dimensional data sets may be stored as static data in the master data base.<br>
Depending on the requirements, different types of accounting-related data sets may be<br>
defined. An individual type of accounting-related data set may for example be associated<br>
with each individual sub-system or application that generates accounting-related data sets.<br>
For each type of accounting-related data set an associated transformation for generating the<br>
multi-dimensional data sets may be provided. Moreover, the processing resources may be<br>
programmed to identify for a specific type of accounting-related data set the particular<br>
transformation (i.e. processing mechanism and associated processing instruction data)<br>
associated therewith. Additionally or alternatively, the processing resources may be pro-<br>
grammed to identify for a specific accounting-related data set the associated static data. To<br>
that end the accounting-related data sets may be provided with a reference to associated<br>
static data as mentioned above.<br>
The network component may have a first interface to receive the accounting-related data<br>
sets from the individual sub-systems and an additional second interface that enables an<br>
access to the master data base. Such an access may be performed to update the master data<br>
base. Updating the master data base may relate to at least one of the static data, (including<br>
reference data) and the processing instruction data. The one or more interfaces of the net-<br>
work component may be part of or in communication with the data sourcing component.<br>
The network component may be implemented as a system including only a single tier or as<br>
a multi-tiered system. The network component may for example be configured as a three-<br>
tiered system including at least one presentation server, at least one application server and<br>
at least one data base server. The one or more presentation servers may be configured to<br>
present the individual data sets or information derived therefrom, whereas the at least one<br>
application server may include processing resources mentioned above. The one or more<br>
data base servers may comprise the individual data bases. Alternatively, the network com-<br>
ponent may be configured as a two-tiered system including at least one presentation server<br>
and at least one combined application and data base server.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention, a computer network system is provided that<br>
comprises the network component (which in turn may comprise individual sub-<br>
components) described above as well as a plurality of sub-systems attached to the one or<br>
more interfaces of the network component. On each sub-system one or more individual<br>
applications for generating the accounting-related data sets may be running.<br>
The individual applications preferably provide standardized accounting-related data sets.<br>
The provision of standardized accounting-related data sets in a pre-defined format is espe-<br>
cially advantageous. In order to ensure that the network component can deduce from<br>
the received accounting-related data sets information on an elementary level, the individ-<br>
ual applications may be programmed not to perform any pre-processing with respect to the<br>
particular processing mechanisms that are to be applied by the network component.<br>
According to a still further aspect of the invention a method of transforming accounting-<br>
related data sets into multi-dimensional data sets is provided. The method includes<br>
providing master data including static data and a multi-dimensional generic data template<br>
which has pre-defined data fields relating to elementary information determined by the<br>
data input requirements of the different processing mechanisms. The accounting-related<br>
data sets are received from a plurality of individual sub-systems. For each accounting-<br>
related data set one or more associated multi-dimensional data sets are generated by<br>
deriving elementary information included in the accounting-relating data set and in static<br>
data associated with the accounting-related data set and by writing the derived elementary<br>
information in corresponding data fields specified by the data template. Using the multi-<br>
dimensional data sets, an elementary data base is updated on the basis of the elementary<br>
information contained therein. The elementary data base is jointly used by the different<br>
processing mechanisms.<br>
The invention can be implemented as a hardware solution, as a software solution or as a<br>
combination thereof. As regards a software solution, the invention relates to a computer<br>
program product comprising program code portions for performing the above steps when<br>
the computer program product is run on one or more components of a computer network.<br>
The computer program product may be stored on a computer readable recording medium.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention, a multi-dimensional data structure<br>
generated from a plurality of accounting related data sets using the steps outlined above<br>
and jointly used by a plurality of processing mechanisms differing with respect to data<br>
input requirements is provided. The data structure includes a plurality of elementary data<br>
sets that reflect the data fields of a multi-dimensional generic data template. The data<br>
fields reflected by the elementary data sets relate to elementary information determined<br>
by the data input requirements of the different processing mechanisms. The elementary<br>
data sets contain accumulated elementary information derived from multi-dimensional<br>
data sets generated from the accounting-related data sets using the data template.<br>

Description of Preferred Embodiments<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates a simplified block diagram of a computer network system according to the<br>
present invention. The network system comprises four sub-systems 10,12,14,16 as de-<br>
scribed in context with Fig. 1. Where appropriate, the same reference numbers will be used<br>
throughout this detailed description and the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.<br>
The network system depicted in Fig. 2 comprises a single central network component 30<br>
including a master data base 32 and an elementary data base 34. The network component<br>
30 is configured as a network node, receiving different types of accounting-related data<br>
sets from the sub-systems 10,12,14,16 and processing the received accounting-related<br>
data sets using different processing mechanisms to generate various kinds of report data<br>
sets (data set 1, data set 2, ....).<br>
More specifically, the network component 30 accumulates elementary information in-<br>
cluded in or derived from the accounting-related data sets received from the sub-systems<br>
10,12,14,16 onto elementary data sets stored in the elementary data base 34. The proc-<br>
essing instruction data used by the processing mechanisms when deriving the elementary<br>
information from the accounting-related data sets and for accumulating the derived ele-<br>
mentary information onto the elementary data sets are retrieved from the master data base<br>
32. Also retrieved from the master data base 32 are the processing instructions characteris-<br>
tic of the individual processing mechanism for generating the report data sets.<br>
Whereas in the conventional network system depicted in Fig. 1 the report data sets are<br>
generated in a distributed manner by a plurality of network components having local data<br>
bases, in the network system according to the invention shown in Fig. 2 only the central<br>
network component 30 is generating the various report data sets from information that is<br>
stored on an elementary level in the elementary data base 34. Hence, redundant data stor-<br>
age is avoided and data reconciliation becomes obsolete. This not only reduces storage<br>
requirements and manual interactions but also reduces the time required for evaluation<br>
processes like reporting mechanisms. It has been found that in large businesses in which<br>
hundreds of millions of accounting-related data sets are generated each month comprehen-<br>
sive reports can thus already be obtained three to five days after the end of the month.<br>
A comparison of the network systems of Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 further shows that whereas the<br>
conventional network system of Fig. 1 involves extensive pre-processing of the generated<br>
accounting-related data sets within the individual sub-systems (see sub-systems 14 and 16<br>
in Fig. 1), no such pre-processing is performed in the network system according to the<br>
invention shown in Fig. 2. Avoiding any pre-processing or at least drastically reducing pre-<br>
processing insures that no elementary information included in the accounting-related data<br>
sets generated by the sub-systems 10,12,14, 16 gets lost, i.e. can no longer be derived<br>
from the (pre-processed) accounting-related data sets eventually received by the network<br>
component 30. Refraining from or at least drastically reducing pre-processing of the ac-<br>
counting-related data sets by the individual sub-systems 10,12,14, 16 is thus advanta-<br>
geous when implementing the processing approach according to the invention, that is<br>
based on the concept of centrally deriving the elementary information.<br>
As regards possible hardware implementations of the network component 30, reference is<br>
now made to Figs. 3 and 4.<br>
Fig. 3 shows one possible client/server configuration, namely a so-called three-tiered ar-<br>
chitecture in which the present invention can be carried out. According to the three-tiered<br>
architecture, the network component 30 is separated into three functional groups: a plural-<br>
ity of presentation servers 36, a plurality of application servers 38 and a plurality of data<br>
base servers 40 as illustrated in Fig. 3 in a hardware-related view.<br>
With the three-tiered architecture shown in Fig. 3, each hardware group 36,38,40 of the<br>
network component 30 is set up to support demands of its functions. The tasks relating to<br>
the presentation of data are handled by the presentation servers 36, which can typically be<br>
configured as personal computers or work stations, enabling easy access to the system's<br>
functionalities as regards the presentation and processing of enriched data sets generated<br>
by individual applications running on the application servers 38.<br>
The presentation servers 36 are coupled to the application servers 38 by means of a local<br>
area network (LAN) 42 or any other type of wired or wireless network, such as a wide area<br>
network (WAN), a wireless LAN (WLAN), a public switched telephone network (PSTN),<br>
an integrated services digital network (ISDN), a satellite link, and the like. Also connected<br>
to the LAN 42 via a homogeneous or inhomogeneous network 43 are the individual sub-<br>
systems providing the accounting-related data sets. In Fig. 3 only two of the sub-systems<br>
10,12 are exemplarily depicted.<br>
The application servers 38 interfacing the presentation servers 36 include the processing<br>
logic. In the present embodiment separate application servers 38 are provided for the task<br>
of processing the received accounting-related data sets to generate multi-dimensional data<br>
sets including the elementary information, for the task of generating and updating the ele-<br>
mentary data base (not depicted in Fig. 3) and for the task of retrieving information from<br>
the elementary data base in conjunction with generating report data sets. The application<br>
servers 38 additionally provide system services such as spooling, dispatching user re-<br>
quests, and formatting data.<br>
The application servers 38 interface with the data base servers 40. The data base servers 40<br>
host the master data base 32 and the elementary data base 34 that have been described in<br>
conjunction with Fig. 2 as well as further data bases that will be described in more detail<br>
below.<br>
According to an alternative approach, a two-tiered architecture as shown in Fig. 4 can be<br>
used. The two-tiered architecture schematically illustrated in Fig. 4 has similarities with<br>
the architecture of Fig. 3. However, the functions of the application servers and data base<br>
servers have been integrated using combined application and data base servers 41. Like in<br>
the embodiment depicted in Fig. 3, the tasks of processing the received accounting-related<br>
data sets, of generating and updating the elementary data base and of retrieving informa-<br>
tion from the elementary data base in context with generating report data sets are per-<br>
formed by three dedicated servers 41.<br>
The presentation layer depicted in Figs. 3 and 4 includes user interfaces that are based on<br>
WEB and MAP servers as well as on fat clients, e.g. for data presentation or work flow<br>
control software packages.<br>
The hardware approaches shown in Figs. 3 and 4 are advantageous in that inter-<br>
dependencies between the network component 30 and the individual sub-systems 10,12,<br>
... are strongly reduced. Furthermore, there is only a single point-of-entry for the account-<br>
ing-related data sets that are provided by the sub-systems 10,12,... to the network com-<br>
ponent 30. This is an expression of the approach of merging the streams of accounting-<br>
related data sets that are to be subjected to different processing mechanisms. The concept<br>
of a single point-of-entry allows to enhance data quality and enables the consistent applica-<br>
tion of data quality checks. Another advantage of focusing the accounting-related data<br>
streams to a single point-of-entry is the resulting single stream of information which al-<br>
lows to accelarate data processing by applying uniform data processing mechanisms and<br>
by introducing massive parallel processing techniques.<br>
In the following, the basic parts of the servers depicted in Figs. 3 and 4 as well as the co-<br>
operation of these parts in context with the processing of accounting-related data sets re-<br>
ceived from the sub-systems 10,12,... will be described with reference to the integrated<br>
view of Fig. 5.<br>
As becomes apparent from Fig. 5, the network component 30 is considered to receive basi-<br>
cally two data streams. On the one hand, the network component 30 receives application<br>
data in the form of accounting-related data sets generated by individual applications run-<br>
ning on the sub-systems 10,12,.... If, for example, the sub-system 10 is configured as an<br>
ATM or a group of ATMs, an accounting-related data set for an ATM transaction may<br>
include a code identifying the particular sub-system, (i.e. a particular ATM or group of<br>
ATMs), a code identifying a customer, a code identifying a particular customer account,<br>
a transaction value and a code relating to the transaction currency. The data sets may be<br>
provided to the network component 30 in a standardized format or - with respect to legacy<br>
systems - in a format that is not standardized but transformable to the required standard<br>
format.<br>
On the other hand, the network component 30 receives master data and updates for master<br>
data. The master data may for example include static data and processing instruction data.<br>
Static data include objects, rules, hierarchies and reference data like lookup tables or tables<br>
of valid values containing a code and a description. Static data are applied to the different<br>
types of data sets like accounting related data sets, multi-dimensional data sets, elementary<br>
data sets, etc.<br>
All the data received from the outside are received via a central data sourcing component<br>
44. The data sourcing component 44 may perform certain pre-processing and data enrich-<br>
ment tasks that do not diminish the informational content of the data received from the<br>
outside and may take the form of a separate server. As becomes apparent from Fig. 5, the<br>
data sourcing component 44 comprises two individual interfaces 44a, 44b for separately<br>
receiving application data in the form of accounting-related data sets on the one hand and<br>
master data (including static data, processing instruction data and updates) on the other<br>
hand.<br>
The data received from the outside are transferred via the data sourcing component 44 into<br>
dedicated data bases. More specifically, the accounting-related data sets received via the<br>
first interface 44a are stored in an entry data base 46, whereas the master data received via<br>
the second interface 44b are stored in the master data base 32. The network component 30<br>
further comprises an item data base 48 for storing multi-dimensional posting related data<br>
sets as well as an elementary data base 34 for storing elementary data sets, e.g. elementary<br>
balance-related data sets.<br>
Additionally, the network component 30 comprises processing resources that are symboli-<br>
cally illustrated as separate processors 52, 54, 56, 58. The processing resources can be<br>
configured as central processing units (CPUs), micro controller units (MCUs), digital sig-<br>
nal processors (DSPs), or the like. It is possible to integrate the individual processors 52,<br>
54,... into fewer components or into a single component or to distribute the task of an<br>
individual one of the processors 52, 54,... among several processors. The processors 52,<br>
54,... are part of the application servers (reference numeral 38 in Fig. 3 and reference nu-<br>
meral 41 in Fig. 4) and configured to perform individual processing tasks in context with<br>
the present invention.<br>
Now the cooperation of the individual parts of network component 30 depicted in Fig. 5<br>
will exemplarily be described in context with transforming an accounting-related data set<br>
generated by an ATM into several multi-dimensional data sets which are used to update<br>
the elementary data base 34.<br>
The accounting-related data set is received via the first interface 44a of the network com-<br>
ponent 30. The interface 44a serves as single point-of-entry for all accounting-related data<br>
sets regardless of their origin.<br>
The ATM data set received by the first interface 44a may have a standardized or a non-<br>
standardized format. In order to streamline the processing tasks performed within the net-<br>
work component 30 it is advantageous to process the accounting-related data sets within<br>
the network component 30 in a standardized format. Thus, the data sourcing component 44<br>
formats any non-standardized accounting-related data sets and writes the formatted (stan-<br>
dardized) accounting-related data sets into the entry data base 46. The formatting is done<br>
such that no elementary information contained in the received accounting-related data sets<br>
gets lost. The entry data base 46 is thus filled with accounting-related data sets having a<br>
standardized format.<br>
It should be noted that the applications running on the individual sub-systems are config-<br>
ured such that no pre-processing is performed that diminishes the informational content<br>
originally generated. Here, the term informational content relates to all informational as-<br>
pects required by the processing mechanisms performed by the processor 58 to generate<br>
the required information, i.e. in the present embodiment the processing mechanisms of<br>
generating balance sheet data sets for official reporting purposes on the one hand and re-<br>
port data sets for e.g. management accounting purposes on the other hand.<br>
Besides formatting any non-standardized accounting-related data sets the data sourcing<br>
component 44 is configured to check the received accounting-related data sets to ensure a<br>
complete, timely and accurate delivery of the data sets from the individual sub-systems. In<br>
the case of inconsistencies as regards the data set content, format, etc., the data sourcing<br>
component 44 allows to handle exceptions. Handling exceptions may include completing a<br>
received accounting-related data set (if possible), notifying a transmitting sub-system of<br>
the inconsistency, triggering a re-transmission of a file containing the accounting-related<br>
data set, etc.<br>
The second interface 44b enables updates of the static data that are stored in the master<br>
data base 32. In general, changes to table entries on static data occur independent from the<br>
delivery of accounting related data sets, occur at different points of times and are made<br>
available for processing mechanisms at a certain point of time for which data consistency<br>
can be guaranteed. Static data are kept outside of the soft-coded program code for the<br>
processing mechanisms, by which they are applied when processing accounting-related<br>
data sets or multi-dimensional data sets or elementary data sets or the like.<br>
As soon as a new accounting-related data set is stored in the entry data base 46, it is auto-<br>
matically retrieved by the processor 52 that applies a central processing logic (CPL) to the<br>
retrieved accounting-related data set. Thus, the CPL processor 52 operates asynchronously.<br>
It should be noted that any data sets retrieved from the entry data base 46 are not immedi-<br>
ately deleted but remain in the entry data base for tracking the flow of information at a<br>
later point in time if required.<br>
The basic task of the CPL processor 52 is to generate one or more multi-dimensional post-<br>
ing-related data sets from an individual accounting-related data set retrieved from the entry<br>
data base 46 as will now be explained with reference to the flow chart of Fig. 6.<br>
In a first step 610 the CPL processor 52 identifies the type of accounting-related data set<br>
retrieved from the entry data base 46 and the processing mechanism that has to be applied<br>
by the CPL processor 52 to transform the accounting-related data set into the one or more<br>
multi-dimensional posting-related data sets. In the present case the CPL processor 52 thus<br>
determines that an ATM data set has been retrieved from the entry data base 46 and that<br>
accordingly an ATM transformation routine has to be applied to this data set. Other types<br>
of accounting-related data sets that may be identified by the CPL processor 52 could in-<br>
clude data sets relating for example to e-banking transactions like an electronic funds<br>
transfers or the like.<br>
Additionally, the CPL processor 52 identifies for the retrieved ATM data set the associated<br>
static data. The static data associated with the ATM data set can for example be deter-<br>
mined using the customer account identificator included in the ATM data set as a refer-<br>
ence.<br>
Using the customer account identificator as reference, the CPL processor 52 retrieves in<br>
a next step 620 associated static data about a customer involved, the customer's position<br>
involved, the entity serving the customer etc. from a look-up table or any other suitable<br>
data structure stored in the mater data base 32. The CPL processor 52 further retrieves the<br>
appropriate ATM transformation and generation rules from the master data base 32 in or-<br>
der to produce multi-dimensional data sets as required by the multi-dimensional generic<br>
data template.<br>
An exemplary generic data template reflecting multi-dimensional attributes is partially<br>
depicted in Fig. 7. The generic data template basically includes a plurality of predefined<br>
data fields that specify all the elementary information required by the various processing<br>
mechanisms applied by the processor 58 to generate different kinds of report data sets. In<br>
other words, the data fields of the generic data template reflect the combined input re-<br>
quirements of the plurality of different processing mechanisms that are to be performed at<br>
a later point in time. Also, the generic template is configured to be applicable to all types<br>
of accounting-related data sets that may be received via the interface 44a or that may be<br>
generated by processing mechanisms within the network component 30. In the embodi-<br>
ment depicted in Fig. 7 the generic data template is comprised of 30 different data fields.<br>
Depending on the particular report requirements, the number of individual data fields may<br>
be increased or, to a certain degree, decreased.<br>
In a next step 630 the CPL processor 52 processes the ATM data set retrieved from the<br>
entry data base 46 and the associated static (and reference) data retrieved from the master<br>
data base 32 to derive the elementary information included therein. This task is performed<br>
under the control of the applicable ATM transformation rules retrieved from the master<br>
data base 32. The transformation rules specify how and which multi-dimensional posting-<br>
related data sets are to be generated in a further step 640 by the CPL processor 52 from the<br>
ATM data set and the associated static data. In the exemplary case of an ATM data set the<br>
transformation rules specify that two individual multi-dimensional posting-related data<br>
sets have to be generated as illustrated in Fig. 8.<br>
From Fig. 8 it becomes apparent that, applying the ATM transformation rules, the CPL<br>
processor 52 generates a first posting-related data set titled "Debit Customer<br>
Account" and a second posting-related data set titled "Cash Turnover". As can be seen, not<br>
all predefined data fields of the generic data template are applicable to the ATM data set.<br>
Consequently, individual ones of the predefined data fields remain empty or can be omit-<br>
ted (e.g. data fields 6 and 8 titled "Cost Center" and "Complex Contract", respectively, or<br>
data field 15 titled "Bank Position ID" of the first posting-related data set).<br>
The generic data template depicted in Fig. 7 and the data sets shown in Fig. 8 are multi-<br>
dimensional in that they include a comparatively high number of pre-defined data fields.<br>
Depending on the input requirements of the processing mechanisms, the generic data tem-<br>
plate may include more than twenty or even more than forty predefined data fields. Due to<br>
this multi-dimensionality of the generic data template, the individual posting-related data<br>
sets generated by the CPL processor 52 on the basis of this generic data template are also<br>
multi-dimensional in that they include much more information than conventional data sets<br>
used for posting purposes.<br>
Also, the information contained in the individual multi-dimensional posting-related data<br>
sets generated by the CPL processor 52 is in general much more elementary than the in-<br>
formation contained in conventional data sets used for posting purposes (that have only to<br>
satisfy the input requirements of one single processing mechanism). The fact that the<br>
multi-dimensional posting-related data sets generated by the CPL processor 52 on the one<br>
hand have a high informational content as regards the combined input requirement of a<br>
plurality of processing mechanisms and on the other hand include information on a very<br>
elementary level is beneficial as regards reducing data redundancy and increasing data<br>
throughput.<br>
The transformation routine performed by the CPL processor 52 includes a control logic<br>
that assigns control attributes to the posting-related data sets. The control attributes control<br>
the later accumulation of the elementary information in the elementary data base 34 and<br>
the generation of report data sets. The assignment of the control attributes is performed<br>
entirely automated based on the individual transformation routine and the information<br>
contained in the accounting-related data sets as well as in the associated static data. In gen-<br>
eral, the control attributes reflect the level of detail and dimensions of reports that can be<br>
generated as well as the technical flexibility and capabilities of the overall system.<br>
The control attributes assigned by the CPL processor 52 include different predefined codes<br>
required for accumulating the elementary information in the elementary data base and for<br>
generating the report data sets by the different processing mechanisms. Thus, the control<br>
attributes may for example include a General Ledger (G/L) account code and a currency<br>
code (both required for the processing mechanism of generating financial accounting re-<br>
ports) and a profit/cost center code and a customer ID code (both required for the proc-<br>
essing mechanism of generating management accounting reports).<br>
The individual multi-dimensional posting-related data sets generated by the CPL processor<br>
52 (like the two posting-related data sets shown in Fig. 8 generated for an ATM data set)<br>
are stored as separate items in the item data base 48. When storing the multi-dimensional<br>
data sets in the item data base 48 the CPL processor 52 links each data set stored in the<br>
item data base 38 with the corresponding accounting-related ("parent") data set stored in<br>
the entry data base 46. This might be done by appending to each posting-related set a ref-<br>
erence to the memory location of the parent data set in the entry data base 46.<br>
The posting-related data sets stored in the item data base 48 are retrieved by a processing<br>
mechanism running on the posting processor 56. The posting processor 56 has the task of<br>
updating the elementary data base 34 on the basis of the elementary information contained<br>
in the multi-dimensional data sets stored in the item data base 48. The elementary data<br>
base 34 is configured as a relational data base having read-only restrictions with respect to<br>
all accesses different from the updating process performed by the posting processor 56.<br>
This guarantees a high integrity and authenticity of the information stored in the elemen-<br>
tary data base 34.<br>
The posting processor 56 accumulates the elementary information included in the posting-<br>
related data sets onto already existing or newly created elementary data sets stored in the<br>
elementary data base 34. This accumulation is performed taking into account the individ-<br>
ual control attributes assigned by the CPL processor 52 under additional control of (post-<br>
ing) control data stored as processing instruction data in the master data base 32.<br>
In the case of the exemplary ATM transaction resulting in the exemplary multi-<br>
dimensional posting-related ATM data sets shown in Fig. 8, the posting processor 56 ac-<br>
cumulates the transaction amount included as elementary information in data fields 29 and<br>
30 (Debit/Credit) of the posting-related data sets onto those elementary data sets in the<br>
elementary data base 34 that are associated with exactly the same set of individual control<br>
attributes (indicated as data fields 1 to 19ff. in the posting-related data sets of Fig. 8).<br>
Thus, the G/L account code, the customer ID code and all the other codes fulfill their func-<br>
tionality as control attributes. In the exemplary embodiment discussed here the various<br>
combinations of control attributes define more than 800 million different elementary data<br>
sets, each elementary data set being specified by a particular combination of control attrib-<br>
utes. This high number of elementary data sets is a consequence of the highly granular<br>
nature of the multi-dimensional posting-related data sets and a pre-requisite of the multi-<br>
ple reporting mechanisms that are to be performed using the elementary data base 34 as<br>
single source of information.<br>
In Fig. 9 two exemplary elementary balance-related data sets generated by repeatedly ac-<br>
cumulating different multi-dimensional ATM data sets as those depicted in Fig. 8 are<br>
shown. As becomes apparent from Fig. 9, the values included in data fields 29 (Debit) and<br>
30 (Credit) of the multi-dimensional data sets shown in Fig. 8 are accumulated onto the<br>
data fields titled "Live to Period Debit", "Live to Period Credit", "Period Net Debit" and<br>
"Period Net Credit" of the individual balance-related data sets shown in Fig. 9. This accu-<br>
mulation is performed taking into account the temporal information included in data field<br>
28 of the multi-dimensional posting-related data sets.<br>
The individual elementary balance-related data sets stored in the elementary data base 34<br>
reflect balance information generated by repeatedly accumulating particular data included<br>
in individual posing-related data sets. The multi-dimensionality of the posting-related data<br>
sets allows to define a plurality of 20, 30 or more key fields in the relational elementary<br>
data base 34 without the necessity to duplicate individual accumulated amounts. The key<br>
fields of the elementary data base 34 relate to the control attributes included in the posting-<br>
related data sets like a profit or cost center code, a customer ID or the like.<br>
It should be noted that the balance-related data sets are shown in Fig. 9 in their logical<br>
structure. Due to the relational nature of the elementary data base 34 the individual data<br>
fields of a balance-related data set may be dispersed over various individual tables.<br>
The posting processor 56 may operate asynchronously or perform the postings batch-wise.<br>
When the posting processor 56 updates the elementary information contained in elemen-<br>
tary data sets on the basis of elementary information included in a posting-related data set<br>
retrieved from the item data base 48, the posting processor 56 additionally performs a link-<br>
ing operation appending a reference to the retrieved multi-dimensional posting-related data<br>
set to the updated elementary data set and/or vice versa.<br>
Since the elementary data sets stored in the elementary data base 34 are updated on the<br>
basis of the elementary information included in the posting-related data sets, the elemen-<br>
tary data sets correspond to individual data fields of the posting-related data sets (and thus<br>
to data fields of the generic data template as shown in Fig. 7). It is ensured that the infor-<br>
mation is kept in the elementary data base 34 on a very granular and elementary level,<br>
which helps to keep the processing mechanisms operating on the elementary data sets<br>
very generic. This is in contrast to the conventional processing mechanisms which in<br>
general do not operate on elementary information but on pre-processed information.<br>
The elementary data sets stored in the elementary data base 34 are retrieved by the report-<br>
ing processor 58 when performing different processing mechanisms like a financial ac-<br>
counting mechanism or a management accounting mechanism to generate respective report<br>
data sets (data set 1 to data set 4 in Fig. 5). Processing instruction data characteristic of the<br>
different processing mechanisms are stored as master data in the master data base 32. The<br>
processing mechanisms may simply be adapted by updating the respective processing in-<br>
struction data stored in the master data base 32.<br>
The report data sets like a balance sheet data set generated by the report processor 58 may<br>
be transferred via the LAN 42 depicted in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 to the presentation servers 36<br>
for being displayed on a local graphical user interface (GUI) or they may be transferred via<br>
any other data transfer mechanism to other computer systems as well, e.g. for consolida-<br>
tion processes on group level.<br>
The elementary data sets stored in the elementary data base 34 are not only retrieved by the<br>
report processor 58 but also by the evaluation processor 54. The evaluation processor 54<br>
performs processing mechanisms that are based on applying pre-defined evaluation criteria<br>
stored as processing instruction data in the master data base 32 and on determining if indi-<br>
vidual values contained in the extracted elementary data sets differ from actual values.<br>
Should this be the case, the evaluation processor 54 generates compensated multi-<br>
dimensional data sets as well as compensated accounting-related data sets as required. Any<br>
newly created and compensated accounting-related data set stored by the evaluation proc-<br>
essor 54 in the entry data base 46 is then retrieved by the CPL processor 52, which proc-<br>
esses the retrieved data set as explained above to generate one or more compensated multi-<br>
dimensional posting-related data sets that are stored in the item data base 48. The compen-<br>
sated multi-dimensional data sets thus generated may then be used by a subsequent proc-<br>
essing mechanism to update the associated elementary data sets in the elementary data<br>
base 34.<br>
Although preferred embodiments of the present invention have been illustrated in the ac-<br>
companying drawings and described in the a foregoing detailed description, it will be un-<br>
derstood that the invention is not limited to the embodiments disclosed, but is capable of<br>
