				<td>The invention relates to a seal arrangement for gas flow diverter used in industry especially in combined cycle power plants.<br>
In the combined cycle power plant operation the heat in the exhaust of gas turbines is used to generate steam. Whenever the heat recovery system or the steam turbine and generator system needed maintenance, the exhaust gas from the gas turbine system is to be diverted to atmosphere through chimney. It should be ensured that there is no leakage of hot gas into the heat recovery boiler system. Gas flow diverter is used to perform the function of sealing the hot gas from entering into the heat recovery boiler system when required and ensures simultaneous opening of another path to facilitate hot gas to go directly to the chimney. PRIOR ART<br>
The sealing arrangement according to the present system for GFD are represented in the accompanying drawings and descried below.<br>
Fig. 1 Diverter seal arrangements as per prior art Fig.  2 an enlarged sectional view of detail 'A1 of Figure 1.<br>
Each side of the diverter blade frame (1)is provided with two seals, inner seal (2) and outer seal (3) and hence needed two extended plates (4) for seal arrangement<br>
and two seal landing bars  (12),  inner and outer seal landing bars.<br><br>
The diverter blade frame (1) is mounted on a bearing (7), the duct wall (8) at the top is provided with seal air ports (13). Figure 2 shows the ceramic fiber (16) for insulation and the antivibration plate (1).<br>
There are disadvantages associated with the present seal arrangement for gas flow diverter.<br>
The main disadvantage is that due to the need of two extended plates for seal arrangement and two seal landing bars, inner and outer seal landing bars adds upto the weight of the diverter blade and the need to provide two seal landing bars adds up to manufacture cost.<br>
Another disadvantage of the present seal arrangement is that the seal air requirement is higher due to long cantilever arrangement for seals and this needs regular inspection and refixing of seals.<br>
Therefore, the main object of the present invention is to propose a seal arrangement to improve the performance of the gas flow diverter for diverting the flow of hot gas from one path to another path with no leak of hot gas.<br>
Another oject of the present invention is to propose a seal arrangement for gas flow diverter which are highly effective and simple fixing arrangement in arresting the gas leakage.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to propose a seal arrangement for gas flow diverter which is easy to manufacture, simple in operation and<br><br>
low maintenance cost.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a sealing device for gas flow diverter in power plants comprising a diverter body designated as diverter blade frame, a seal plate tightly fixed to a connecting rib which is being rigidly fixed to a extended plate or the seal plate being tightly fixed to<br>
the extended plate of the diverter body, the said seal plate being adopted in<br>
the shape of as herein describedorformfrom two split seal or from a single sheet seal plate<br>
respectively to form a seal resting on a single seal landing bar, the said diverter body being provided with seal air ports uniformly provided with two adjacent ports on both sides of the seal landing bar.<br>
The nature of the invention, its objective and further advantages residing in the same will be apparent from the following description made with reference to non-limiting exemplary embodiments of the invention represented in the accompanying drawings.<br>
Figure 3 - shows the detail of the diverter blade frame with seal arragement according to the present invention.<br>
Figure 4 - diverter seal arrangement according to detail B of Figure 3. Figure 5 - diverter seal arrangement according to detail C of Figure 3.<br>
The embodiment of new V - Type seal arrangement is shown in Figs. 3 and 4 in detail B. The seal plates (9) are arranged on the connecting rib (15) which is welded to the extended plate (4) of diverter body (1) in such a way that they form the shape of V. The bias springs<br><br>
(10) press against the seals and the stiffner plates (11) and anti-vibration plate (11) act to dampen the vibrations. The V-seals rest on a single seal landing bar (12) and the seal air enters through eight seal air ports (13) at the duct wall (8) and uniformly arranged two on each side of<br>
seal landing bar (12). The embodiment of  -Type seal<br>
arrangement is shown in Fig. 5, detail C. A single seal sheet is formed to the shape  seal curved plate (14) and is fixed to the extended plate (4) of the diverter body (1) by bolts along with two bias springs (10) and stiffener plates (11). This seal rests on a single seal landing bar (12) and the seal air enters through eight seal air ports (13) uniformly arranged two on each side of seal landing bar (12). The diverter body (1) is mounted in a bearing (7) at the top and is insulated with ceramic fiber (16).<br>
The performance of the gas flow diverter depends on the efficient function of the seals (2,3). Seals (2,3) are made out of special spring steel sheets to ensure trouble free operation at high temperatures and at high stresses.The diverter body  (1)  is normally rectangular in shape and is made out of sheet steel and sufficiently insulated (16) to ensure safe working of men at the other side. The diverter body (1) is made structurally rigid by proper reinforcements.<br>
Allowing for free thermal expansion the seals ( 2,3) are bolted with reinforcements to the extended rims at two faces of the diverter blade frame (1). The diverter blade (1) is operated by a drive system, which ensures<br><br>
the diverter blade to be rotated by 90  through the bearings (7) at one end of the diverter body (1). When<br>
the diverter blade (1) is in the vertical position the seals ( 2,3) on one face will press against the seal landing bars (12) of the duct. This ensures closing of the duct for hot gas to heat recovery boiler system. The hot gas is now free to leave through the top opening to the chimney. When the diverter ( 12) moves through 90° up, the seals (2,3) on the other side of the diverter blade (1) press against the seal landing bars ( 12) of duct near the chimney at the top. This ensures closing the way to the chimney side and opening the way for hot gas to heat recovery boiler system.<br>
