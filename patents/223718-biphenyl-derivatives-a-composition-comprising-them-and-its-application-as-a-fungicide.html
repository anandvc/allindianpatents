Throughout this description, temperatures arc given in degrees Celsius; "NMR" means nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum; MS stands for mass spectrum; MM or M*+l are signals in the mass spectrum respectively corresponding to the molecular weight minus 1 or the molecular weight plus 1; and "%" is percent by weight, unless corresponding concentrations are indicated in other units*<br><br>
Table 14 shows selected melting point, selected molecular ion and selected NMR data, all with CDCh as the solvent (unless otherwise stated; if a mixture of solvents is present, this is indicated as, for example, (CDCI3 / d$-DMSO)), (no attempt is made to list all characterising data in all cases) for compounds of Tables 1 to 13* Unless otherwise stated, the data relate to a cis/trans mixture of each compound.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The compounds according to the present invention may be prepared according to the* following reaction schemes, in which, unless otherwise stated, the definition of each variable is as defined above for a compound of formula (I).<br>
There are a number of alternative methods for preparing a compound of formula (I).<br>
Method A<br>
A compound of formula (I) may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula (II) with a compound of formula Het-C(=0)OR' [where R' is C1-4alkyl] in the presence of strong base [for example NaH or sodium hexamethyldisilazane], in a dry polar solvent [preferably THF] and at a temperature between -10°C and the boiling point of the solvent [preferably at ambient temperature]. The article by J.Wang et al, Synlett 2001,1485 provides details of analogous preparations.<br>
Method B<br>
A compound of formula (I) may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula (II) with a compound of formula Het-COK^R" [where R" is OH or a leaving group, such as CI, Br, F or 0C(=:O)C1-4alkyl] in an inert organic solvent [such as ethylacetate, dichloromethane, dioxane or DMF] and at a temperature between -10°C and the boiling point of the solvent [preferably at ambient temperature]. If R" is OH, the reaction is carried out in the presence of an activating agent [for example BOP-C1] and two equivalents of a base [such as a tertiary<br><br><br><br><br>
[where FG is a functional group which is convertible to R7 in one or more synthetic steps]. Functional group interconversions are standard procedures for a person skilled in the art. There are many methods described in the literature, which can be used as such or with modifications according to the functionalities present; Table A gives literature references (some of which also cite further appropriate references) which are specifically relevant to the preparation of a compound of formula (I) by the interconversion of FG to R7. It is apparent to the person skilled in the art that the literature examples given in Table A are not necessarily limited to the preparation of the specifically mentioned R7 but can be also applied by analogy to the preparation of other structurally related R7<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
