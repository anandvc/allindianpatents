DESCRIPTION<br>
ARYLAMINE COMPOUND AND ORGANIC ELECTROLUMINESCENCE DEVICE CONTAINING THE SAME<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a novel arylamine compound and an organic electroluminescent device using the same, specifically to an organic electroluminescent device which has a high luminance, a high heat resistance and a long life and which is excellent in a hole transporting property and has a high luminous efficiency and a novel arylamine compound which realizes the same.<br>
RELATED ART<br>
An organic electroluminescent (EL) device using an organic substance is used as a light source for a plane emitter for a wall-mounted television set and a backlight for a display, and it has actively been developed. An electroluminescent phenomenon of organic materials was observed on anthracene single crystal by Pope et al. in 1963 (J. Chem. Phys. 38 (1963) 2042), and Helfinch and Schneider succeeded in observing relatively strong injection type EL by using a solution<br><br>
electrode system having a good injection efficiency (Phys. Rev. Lett. 14 (1965 229). As reported since then, it has been researched to form organic luminous substances from conjugate organic host substances and conjugate organic activators having condensed benzene rings.  Shown as the examples of the organic host substances were naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene, tetracene, pyrene, benzopyrene, chrysene, picene, carbazole, fluorene, biphenyl, terphenyl, triphenylene oxide, dihalobiphenyl, trans-stilbene and 1,4-diphenylbutadiene, and anthracene, tetracene and pentacene were given as the examples of the activators. However, all of the above organic luminous substances were present in the form of a single layer having a thickness exceeding 1 //m, and a high electric field was required for luminescence. Accordingly, research of thin film devices by a vacuum vapor deposition method was promoted (for example, Thin Solid Films 94 (1982) 171).  However, though a reduction in a film thickness was effective for a reduction in a driving voltage, it did not come to obtain a device of a practical use level having a high luminance.  Then, Tang et al. devised an EL device prepared by laminating two very thin films (a hole transporting layer and a luminescent layer) between an anode and a cathode by<br><br>
vacuum vapor deposition to realize a high luminance at a low driving voltage (Appl. Phys. Lett. 51 (1987)913 or U.S. Patent No. 4356429).  Then, developments of organic compounds used for a hole transporting layer and a luminescent layer were promoted for ten and several years, and as a result thereof, an organic EL device was started being put into practical use in display parts of car stereos and portable telephones.<br>
However, durability of the luminance against deterioration with the passage of time in use for long time is not satisfactory in terms of actual use and required to be further improved.  In particular, when considering application thereof to full color displays, it is required to the respective colors of R, G and B to achieve a half life of several thousand hours at a high luminance of 300 cd/m or more.  It is particularly difficult in phosphorescent type luminescence to achieve this.  Energy gap in a luminescent layer is as large as 3.0 eV or more, and large energy barrier is present between a hole transporting layer and a luminescent layer in injecting a hole, so that a field intensity applied to the interface is large, and a hole can not stably be injected in a conventional hole transporting layer. Accordingly, improvement thereof has been required.<br><br>
Further, on the assumption that an organic EL device is mounted on a car, a preserving performance thereof at a high temperature is required, but it is pointed out that it has a problem on a preserving performance at a high temperature of 100°C or higher. Also in this case, it is pointed out that a glass transition temperature is low in a conventional hole transporting layer, and it has been tried to cope therewith only by improving the glass transition temperature to 100°C or higher, but it is unsatisfactory, and the good preserving performance at a high temperature has not yet been realized.<br>
Various inventions have been made in order to solve the problems described above, and a luminescent device in which a compound represented by the following Formula (A) is used as a hole transporting material is disclosed in, for example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 25473/1993:<br><br>
wherein R11 represents an alkyl group or an aralkyl group, and R12 to R15 represent a hydrogen atom, an<br><br>
alkyl group, an alkoxy group or a halogen atom.<br>
However, the above compound had a glass transition temperature of 100°C or lower, and a device prepared by using the same had a short life and was short of a heat resistance, so that it could not be put into practical use.  Further, known is a compound obtained by changing R12 to R15 to aryl groups in order to improve the above matter, but it is scarcely soluble and therefore hard to be highly purified, so that a problem has been involved in using it as a material for a long life device.<br>
Further, a luminescent device in which a compound represented by the following Formula (B) is used as a hole transporting material is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 288783/1999:<br><br>
wherein Ari to Ar3 each represent a substituted or non-substituted aryl group, and Ar2 and Ar3 may form a nitrogen-containing heterocycle together with a nitrogen atom to which they are bonded; Ri and R2 each represent a hydrogen atom, a linear, branched or cyclic<br><br>
alkyl group, a substituted or non-substituted aryl group or a substituted or non-substituted aralkyl group; Zi and Z2 each represent a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, a linear, branched or cyclic alkyl group, a linear, branched or cyclic alkoxy group or a substituted or non-substituted aryl group; and X represents a substituted or non-substituted arylene group.<br>
A fluorene group is introduced into the above compounds, but the glass transition temperatures are still low and have been required to be improved. Further, the fluorene groups present at the ends thereof have a high flatness and therefore cause interactions (exiplex, charge-transfer complex and the like) with compounds in the other layers in constituting a laminate, so that there used to be involved therein the problem that a luminescent efficiency of the devices is reduced.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been made in order to solve the problems described above, and an object thereof is to provide an organic EL device which has a high luminance, a high heat resistance and a long life and which is excellent in a hole transporting property<br><br>
and has a high luminous efficiency and a novel arylamine compound which realizes the same.<br>
Intensive researches repeated by the present inventors in order to achieve the object described above have resulted in finding that use of an arylamine compound of a specific structure having at least one spiro bond provides an organic EL device which has a high heat resistance and a long life because of a high glass transition temperature and which is excellent in a hole transporting property and has a high luminous efficiency because of increased steric hindrance and less liability of association due to a flatness of molecules which is reduced by containing the specific spiro bond, and thus they have come to complete the present invention.<br>

a cyclic structure; Ar5 is a single bond or a divalent group comprising a substituted or non-substituted aromatic hydrocarbon group having 6 to 40 carbon atoms or a substituted or non-substituted heterocyclic group having 5 to 40 carbon atoms; L is a single bond, -0-, -S-, -NR4- or -CR5R6- (R4, R5 and R6 each are independently a substituted or non-substituted alkyl group having 1 to 50 carbon atoms or a substituted or non-substituted aryl group having 6 to 40 carbon atoms); s, q and r each are an integer of 0 to 2; and R1 and R2 may be combined with each other to form a ring.<br>
Further, the present invention provides an organic EL device in which an organic compound layer comprising one layer or plural layers including at least a luminescent layer is interposed between a cathode and an anode, wherein at least one of the above organic compound layers contains the arylamine derivative described above; an organic EL device in which an organic compound layer comprising one layer or plural layers including at least a luminescent layer is interposed between a cathode and an anode, wherein at least one of the above organic compound layers contains the arylamine derivative described above and a luminescent material; and an organic EL device in which<br><br>

The organic EL device is improved in a luminance, a heat resistance, a life and a luminous efficiency by adding the arylamine compound of the present invention to at least one layer of the organic compound layers because the arylamine compound is excellent in a hole transporting property, and a hole can stably be injected; a glass transition temperature is high; a flatness of molecules is reduced due to a spiro bond contained therein, so that steric hindrance is increased; it is less liable to interact with the luminescent material, and non-radiation transition caused by the interaction can be avoided.<br><br>
The organic EL device of the present invention is a device in which an organic compound layer comprising a single layer or plural layers is formed between an anode and a cathode.  In the case of the single layer type, a luminescent layer is provided between an  anode and a cathode.  The luminescent layer contains the luminescent material, and in addition thereto, it may contain a hole injecting material or an electron injecting material in order to transport a hole injected from the anode or an electron injected from the cathode to the luminescent material.

palladium and alloys thereof, metal oxides such as tin oxide and indium oxide which are used for an ITO substrate and an NESA substrate and organic conductive resins such as polythiophene and polypyrrole.<br>
The conductive material used for the cathode in the organic EL device of the present invention is suitably a material having a work function of smaller than 4 eV, and used therefor are magnesium, calcium, tin, lead, titanium, yttrium, lithium, ruthenium, manganese, aluminum and alloys thereof, but it shall not be restricted to them. The representative examples of the alloys include, for example, magnesium/silver, magnesium/indium and lithium/aluminum.

In the organic EL device of the present invention, it is preferred that at least one surface thereof is sufficiently transparent in a luminescent wavelength area of the device in order to efficiently emit light. Further, the substrate is preferably transparent as well. A transparent electrode is set up by a method such as vapor deposition and sputtering using the<br><br>
conductive materials described above so that prescribed transparency is secured. The electrode on the luminescent face is preferably controlled to a light transmittance of 10 % or more.

The film thickness shall not specifically be restricted, and it has to be set to a suited film thickness.  If the film thickness is too large, large voltage has to be applied in order to obtain a constant light output, so  that the efficiency is deteriorated.  If the film thickness is too small, pinholes are formed, and the satisfactory light emitting luminance is not obtained when applying an electric field.  Usually, the film thickness falls in a range of suitably 5 nm to 10 jam,   preferably 10 nm to 0.2 /im.<br>
In the case of the wet film forming method, materials for forming the respective layers are dissolved or dispersed in a suitable solvent such as ethanol, chloroform, tetrahydrofuran and dioxane to form thin films, and the solvent may be any one.

The glass substrate equipped with an ITO transparent electrode line after washing was mounted on a substrate holder of a vacuum depositing apparatus, and a film of the following compound H232 having a film thickness of 60 nm was formed on a face at a side on which the transparent electrode line was formed so that the transparent electrode described above was covered. This H232 film functions as a hole injecting layer. Next, a film of the compound (HT-01) having a film thickness of 20 nm described above was formed on the H232 film.  This film functions as a hole transporting layer.<br>
Further, the following compound EMI was deposited as a host material to form a film having a film thickness of 40 nm.  The following amine compound Dl having a styryl group was deposited as a luminescent dopant at the same time as above so that a weight ratio of EMI to Dl was 40 : 2. This film functions as a<br><br>
luminescent layer.<br>
A film of the following compound Alq having a film thickness of 20 nm was formed on the above film. This film functions as an electron injecting layer. Further, an LiF film (film thickness: 1 nm) was formed as an electron injecting layer (or a cathode).

This device was subjected to a current-carrying test to obtain blue luminescence having a light emitting luminance of 153 nit, a maximum light emitting luminance of 50,000 nit and a luminous efficiency of 4.8 cd/A at a direct current voltage of 6 V.  Further, it was stored in an atmosphere of 105°C for 500 hours to carry out a heat resistance storage test. A direct current voltage of 6 V was applied as was the case with before the test to find that a luminance of 98 % (luminance preserving rate: 98 %) based on the initial<br><br><br><br>
Examples 9 to 13 production and evaluation of organic EL devices<br>
Organic EL devices were produced in the same manner as in Example 8, except that in Example 8, compounds shown in Table 1 were used in place of the compound (HT-01), and the current-carrying test and the heat resistance storage test were carried out in the same manner as in Example 8.  The results thereof are shown in Table 1.<br>
Comparative Example 1 production and evaluation of organic EL device<br>
An organic EL device was produced in the same manner as in Example 8, except that in Example 8, the following compound TPAF (glass transition temperature:  lower than 100°C) was used in place of the compound (HT-01), and the current-carrying test and the heat resistance storage test were carried out in the same manner as in Example 8. The results thereof are shown in Table 1.<br><br><br>
Comparative Example 2 production and evaluation of organic EL device<br>
An organic EL device was produced in the same manner as in Example 8, except that in Example 8, N,N’-di(4-biphenyl)-N,N’-[2-(9,9-dimethylfluorenyl)]-4,4’-diaminobiphenyl (DFDBBZ shown below) (glass transition temperature: lower than 100°C) was used in place of the compound (HT-01), and the current-carrying test and the heat resistance storage test were carried out in the same manner as in Example 8.  The results thereof are shown in Table 1.<br><br><br><br><br>
As shown in Table 1, TPAF used in Comparative Example 1 is poor in a heat resistance because of a low glass transition temperature, and the luminance after stored at 105°C for 500 hours is lowered down to 10 % of the luminance before storing.<br>
DFDBBZ used in Comparative Example 2 has a high glass transition temperature and is satisfactory in a heat resistance.  However, it has a high flatness in an end part having a fluorene skeleton and therefore brings about exciplex with the luminescent material. Accordingly, it is considered that the luminescent color is shifted to a longer wavelength and reduced in efficiency.<br>
On the other hand, the organic EL devices produced in Examples 8 to 13 using the arylamine compounds according to the present invention are improved in a light emitting luminance and a luminous efficiency and excellent in a heat resistance. This is considered to be attributable to the facts that the arylamine compounds according to the present invention have a high glass transition temperature of 100°C or higher due to a fluorene skeleton having a specific structure and that the cyclic structure introduced into the end makes it less liable to bring about exciplex with the luminescent layer.<br><br>
Example 14 production and evaluation of organic EL device<br>
An organic EL device was produced in the same manner as in Example 8, except that in Example 8, Alq and rubrene were deposited in a weight ratio of 30 : 1 in place of the compounds EMI and Dl to form a film having a film thickness of 40 nm.<br>
This device was subjected to a current-carrying test to obtain blue luminescence having a light emitting luminance of 1,300 nit, a maximum light emitting luminance of 98,000 nit and a very high luminous efficiency of 9.5 cd/A at a direct current voltage of 6 V.  Further, it was stored in an atmosphere of 105°C for 500 hours to carry out a heat resistance storage test. A direct current voltage of 6 V was applied as was the case with before the test to find that a luminance of 99 % (luminance preserving rate: 99 %) based on the initial luminance was shown.<br>
Further, the device was operated in an initial luminance of 1,000 nit at a constant current to carry out a life test to find that the half life was as very long as 6,900 hours.  It can be found from the above matters that the arylamine compound of the present invention is very excellent as a hole transporting<br><br>
compound<br>
Comparative Example 3 production and evaluation of organic EL device<br>
An organic EL device was produced in the same manner as in Example 14, except that in Example 14, DFDBBZ was used in place of the compound (HT-01).  This device was operated in an initial luminance of 1,000 nit at a constant current to carry out a life test to find that the half life was as short as 1,850 hours.<br>
Example 15 production and evaluation of organic EL device<br>
An organic EL device was produced in the same manner as in Example 11, except that in Example 11, only Alq was deposited in place of the compounds EMI and Dl used for the luminescent layer to form a film having a film thickness of 40 nm. A luminescent dopant was not used.<br>
The device thus obtained was subjected to the current-carrying test and the heat resistance storage test in the same manner as in Example 8, and the results thereof are shown in Table 2.<br>
Comparative Example 4 production and evaluation of<br><br>
organic EL device<br>
An organic EL device was produced in the same manner as in Example 15, except that in Example 15, the compound DFDBBZ was used in place of the compound HT-04. A luminescent dopant was not used.<br>
The device thus obtained was subjected to the current-carrying test and the heat resistance storage test in the same manner as in Example 8, and the results thereof are shown in Table 2.<br><br><br><br>
As shown in Table 2, the device using the compound DFDBBZ used in Comparative Example 4 has a low initial luminous efficiency as compared with that of the device produced in Example 15 using HT-04.  Further, the preserving rate after stored at high temperature is 90 % or lower.  It is considered that DFDBBZ provides the device with a low efficiency and a low luminance preserving rate due to any interaction.<br>
Example 17<br>
An organic EL device was produced in the same manner as in Example 8, except that in Example 8, used were the following compound CBP in place of the compound EMI used for the luminescent layer and the compound Ir(ppy)3 described above in place of the compound Dl and that the following compound BAlq for forming a film having a film thickness of 10 nm and then the compound Alq for forming a film having a film thickness of 20 nm were deposited in place of depositing the compound Alq in the electron injecting layer to form a film having a film thickness of 20 nm.<br>
The device thus obtained was measured for a luminous efficiency at a direct current voltage of 6 V to find that it was 34 cd/A.<br><br><br>
