				<td>MATRIX TYPE SUSTAINED-RELEASE PREPARATION CONTAINING BASIC DRUG OR SALT THEREOF, AND METHOD FOR MANUFACTURING THE SAME<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a matrix type sustained-release preparation containing a basic drug or a salt thereof, more specifically, relates to the preparation which not only inhibits the initial drug burst (rapid drug release immediately after dissolution) in a dissolution test, but also ensures dissolution with low pH dependence of the basic drug or the salt thereof at the early stage of dissolution, in the dissolution test. The present invention also relates to a matrix type sustained-release preparation containing a basic drug or a salt thereof in which a ratio of a dissolution rate of the basic drug or the salt thereof in an acidic test solution to a dissolution rate of the basic drug or the salt thereof in a neutral test solution (dissolution rate in the acidic test solution / dissolution rate in the neutral test solution) decreases with dissolution time at the late stage of dissolution, as compared to the early stage of dissolution.<br>
Background Art<br>
As compared to ordinary rapid-release preparations, a sustained-release preparation containing a physiologically active drug allows Wood concentrations of the drug to be maintained for a long time at or above the effective therapeutic concentration. Accordingly, by achieving the sustained-release characteristics of a drug it is possible to reduce the number of administrations while providing the same or better therapeutic effects, potentially improving compliance. With the sustained-release characteristics of the drug, it is also possible to avoid a rapid increase in<br>
blood concentration of the drug immediately after administration, thus potentially reducing adverse effects, toxicity and the like due to the drug.<br>
In general, the sustained-release preparation containing the drug which is physiologically active can be classified into two type preparations; (1) a sustained-release coated type preparation, in which release of the drug is controlled by coating a surface of a core particle or a core tablet containing a physiologically active drug with a sustained-release coating: (2) a matrix type preparation, in which the drug and a sustained-release base are distributed uniformly in the preparation.<br>
Because drug release is affected by the uniformity of the coating in the sustained-release coated preparations, the coating conditions of the sustained-release coating have to be strictly controlled, and productivity is often low because of long coating times. Further, when applying the sustained-release coating to granules, the sustained-release coating is generally applied after the drug has been stacked on a core particle generally containing crystalline cellulose or sucrose. Consequently, a size of the preparation tends to be large when multiple layers of the sustained-release coating are applied or when a preparation contains a large amount of the drug, making it harder to administer orally.<br>
On the other hand, the matrix type sustained-release preparations have a structure in which the drug and the sustained-release base are present uniformly in the preparation and do not require the same strict production conditions as the sustained-release coated preparations, and can be produced by manufacturing operations similar to those for the ordinary rapid-release preparations.  Accordingly, high productivity can be expected for the matrix type sustained-release preparations. In addition, it is easy to prepare the matrix type sustained-release preparation even when it contains a large quantity of the drug, and a size of the preparation "does not<br>
need to be large. Thus, the matrix type sustained-release preparations are more useful than the sustained-release coated preparations from the standpoint of productivity and smaller size of the preparations.<br>
However, when the physiologically active drug is a basic drug or a salt thereof, the following problems generally occur when preparing a matrix type sustained-release preparation using a water-insoluble base:<br>
The first problem is that in a dissolution test of a matrix type sustained-release preparation containing a basic drug or a salt thereof, the dissolution rate of the basic drug or the salt thereof with dissolution time is generally much lower in a basic test solution than in an acidic test solution. This is because solubility of the basic drug or the salt thereof in an aqueous solvent is lower in a neutral and an alkaline pH range than in an acidic pH range. Because the sustained-release preparations generally comprises a larger amount of the drug than that of the rapid-release preparations, if a retention time of the sustained-release preparation in stomach is prolonged, there are risks of an unexpected increase in blood concentration of the basic drug or the salt thereof and onset of the adverse effects involved. This risk of the onset of the adverse effects is particularly serious in the case of the basic drug or the salt thereof with strong adverse effects and the basic drug and the salt thereof with a narrow safety range of blood concentration.<br>
The second problem is that the release' rate of the basic drug or the salt thereof from the matrix type sustained-release preparation is lower at the late stage of dissolution than at the early stage of dissolution in the dissolution test.  If the dissolution speed of the basic drug or the salt thereof from the sustained-release preparation in the acidic test solution is controlled with the aim of avoiding the first problem described above (that is, the rapid increase in blood concentration due to<br>
prolonged retention time of the drug or the salt thereof in stomach), in the case of the sustained-release preparation with a short gastric emptying time, this preparation is excreted with most of the drug remaining in the preparation, thus decreasing bioavailability and posing a different risk that pharmacologically effective concentrations will not be achieved.<br>
This is because the water-insoluble matrix does not dissolve in the dissolution test solution, and consequently, the diffusion distance in the matrix that the drug must pass through in order to be released becomes longer with dissolution time. Thus, if the release speed of the basic drug or the salt thereof is inhibited too much at the early stage of dissolution, there may be a higher risk that the matrix type sustained-release preparation is excreted with most of the drug remaining in the preparation outside the body. Moreover, as the matrix type sustained-release preparation moves from the stomach to the small intestine, the drug release speed decreases as a pH surrounding the preparation becomes neutral or weakly alkaline, thus increasing the risk that this preparation is excreted with most of the drug remaining in the preparation outside the body. This is undesirable because it reduces the bioavailability of the drug and gives the uncertainty of the pharmacological effects.<br>
The following related art documents pertain to the matrix type sustained-release preparations containing the basic drug or the salt thereof. U.S. Patent No. 4,792,452 discloses, for example, a matrix preparation which contains a basic drug or a salt thereof, alginic acid or a salt thereof, a pH-independent water-soluble gelatinizing agent and a binder. U.S. Patent No. 4,968,508 discloses, for example, a matrix preparation which contains Cefaclor, an acrylic acid polymer which dissolves at pH 5.0 to 7.4 and a hydrophilic polymer. Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H6-199657 discloses, for example, that a pH-dependent dissolution of a drug<br>
with higher solubility in an acetic add buffer, pH 4.0 than in Istfluid and 2nd fluid of the Japanese Pharmacopoeia can be improved by preparing matrix tablets containing a water-soluble polymer, "a carboxyvinyl polymer or methylvinyl ether-maleic anhydride copolymer" and an enteric base. U.S. Patent No. 6,287,599 discloses, for example, a matrix preparation which contains a basic drug or a salt thereof with pH-dependent solubility, a pH-independent sustained-release base and a pH-dependent additive such as an enteric base, an organic acid and the like (which increases the dissolution rate of the drug from a tablet at a pH in excess of 5.5). However, these related art documents relate to the matrix type sustained-release preparations aimed only at pH-independent release of the drug, and their inventors do not have necessarily studied how to eliminate or inhibit the aforementioned risks of the onset of adverse events (the first problem described above) and reduced bioavailability due to the sustained release characteristics (the second problem described above). That is, there is no disclosure of a preparation which not only inhibits the dissolution of the basic drug or the salt thereof in accordance with the environment in the body so that the initial drug burst (rapid release of the drug immediately after dissolution) is suppressed, but also reliably provides dissolution with low pH-dependence at the early stage of the dissolution test, and wherein a ratio of the dissolution rate of the basic drug or the salt thereof in an acidic test solution to the dissolution rate of the basic drug or the salt thereof in a neutral test solution (dissolution rate in the acidic test solution / dissolution rate in the neutral test solution) decreases with dissolution time at the late stage of dissolution, as compared to the early stage of dissolution.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
Taking a pH environment in the body into consideration, there is a demand for the sustained-release preparations containing a basic drug, which inhibit unexpected increases in blood concentrations associated with the rapid dissolution of the basic drug from the preparations and which offer a decreased risk of reduced bioavailability associated with the sustained-release characteristics, that is, there is a demand for a matrix type sustained-release preparation containing a basic drug or a salt thereof, which not only inhibits the initial drug burst (rapid drug release immediately after dissolution) in a dissolution test, but also ensures dissolution with low pH dependence of the basic drug or the salt thereof at the early stage of dissolution, and wherein as the dissolution test proceeds, a dissolution speed in a neutral test solution is high at the late stage of dissolution. Accordingly, this is a demand for the matrix type sustained-release preparation containing a basic drug or a salt thereof in which a ratio of a dissolution rate of the basic drug or the salt thereof in an acidic test solution to a dissolution rate of the basic drug or the salt thereof in a neutral test solution (dissolution rate in the acidic test solution / dissolution rate in the neutral test solution) decreases with dissolution time at the late stage of dissolution, as compared to the early stage of dissolution. In particular, there is a demand for a matrix type sustained-release preparation which is capable of controlling the dissolution of the basic drug or the salt thereof, so that the solubility of the basic drug or the salt thereof decreases greatly with increased pH from a near-neutral to a weakly alkaline.

Advantageous Effects of the Invention<br>
According to the present invention, in a matrix type sustained-release preparation containing a basic drug or a salt thereof, which has higher solubility in the 0.1 N hydrochloric acid solution and the neutral aqueous solution, pH 6.0 than in the basic aqueous solution, pH 8.0, the pH dependence of dissolution of the drug or the salt thereof at the early stage of dissolution is reduced, and the ratio of the dissolution rate of the drug or the salt thereof in the acidic test solution to the dissolution rate of the drug or the salt thereof in the neutral test solution (dissolution rate in the acidic test solution / dissolution rate in the neutral test solution) decreases with dissolution time as the dissolution test proceeds (the ratio being lower at the late stage than at the early stage of the dissolution test). From these dissolution behaviors, the risk of adverse events due to the sustained release characteristics at the early stage of dissolution can be reduced, and the risk of reduced bioavailability can also be inhibited. Furthermore, since 90% or more of the drug contained in the preparation according to the present invention can be released in the neutral test solution within 8 hours which is the estimated as the upper limit of large intestinal arrival time in humans, there is little risk of decreased bioavailability due to the sustained release characteristics, and it is believed that the preparations according to the present invention are extremely useful.

Either one or two or more of these basic drugs or salts thereof may be contained in the matrix type sustained-release preparation according to the present invention.<br>
Of these basic drugs or salts thereof, the anti-dementia drugs are preferred, and donepezil hydrochloride and / or memantine hydrochloride are particularly preferred. The matrix type sustained-release preparation according to the present invention may be also suitable for the basic drugs or the salts thereof which have a narrow drug safety range or which produce adverse effects dependent on maximum blood concentration of the drug. There are no particular limitations on the anti-dementia drug contained in the matrix type sustained-release preparation according to the present invention, but from the standpoint of controlling release it is effective for the basic drugs or the salts thereof which are less soluble in an alkaline aqueous solution than in an acidic aqueous solutions and the solubility of the basic drugs or the salts thereof for a pH of an aqueous solution changes near the neutral pH. Examples include the basic drugs or the salts thereof with a pKa of 7.0 to 12, preferably 7.5 to 11, more preferably 8.0 to 10.5, still more preferably 8.5 to 10.5. For example, donepezil hydrochloride is a basic drug with a pKa of 8.90 and memantine hydrochloride is a basic drug with a pKa of 10.27.<br>
There are no particular limitations on the solubility of the basic drug or the salt thereof used in the present invention with respect to acidic aqueous solutions, neutral<br>
aqueous solutions or basic aqueous solutions, but the solubility of the basic drug or the salt thereof in the acidic aqueous solution and the neutral aqueous solution is higher than its solubility in the basic aqueous solution.  Herein, for use in preparation of these aqueous solutions, examples for this use includes, but are not limited to, a phosphate buffer (for instance, buffers prepared with 50 mM sodium phosphate solution and hydrochloric acid), buffers such as G. L. Miller's buffer, Atkins-Pantin's buffer, Good's buffer or the like, 0.1 N hydrochloric acid, 0.1 mol/L sodium hydroxide solution or the like.  Note that the solubility used in the present invention refers to solubility wherein a solution temperature is 25 °C.<br>
The term "solubility in an acidic aqueous solution" used in the present invention means that a solubility of the basic drug or the salt thereof in a solution exhibiting an acidic property when dissolving the basic drug or the salt thereof in a buffer or the like. Similarly, the term "solubility in a neutral (basic) aqueous solution used in the present invention means that a solubility of the basic drug or the salt thereof in a solution exhibiting a neutral (basic) property when dissolving the basic drug or the salt thereof in a buffer or the like.<br>

Mixing and compression-molding are accomplished by the ordinary methods commonly used in the field of the p'reparation, without particular limitations. The matrix type sustained-release preparation can be manufactured by the direct method of compression-molding using a tabletting machine after the mixing step. The matrix type sustained-release preparation can also be manufactured by the manufacturing method which comprises the steps of: granulating the mixture after mixing and before compression-molding.   For example, any granulating method can be used including<br>
wet granulation method, dry granulation method, fluidized bed granulation method, wet extrusion method, spray-drying method and the like.<br>

Capsules can be packed with one or more tablets, granules or fine granules based on the matrix type sustained-release preparation according to the present invention.  For example, hard capsules can be packed with multiple small-diameter mini-tablets based on the matrix type sustained-release preparation, or with the aforementioned granules or fine granules based on the matrix type sustained-release preparation, or with both tablets based on the matrix sustained-release preparation and granules or fine granules based on the matrix type sustained-release preparation. The matrix type sustained-release preparation can also be given a film coating as necessary. It should be noted that the presence or absence of a water-soluble film coating on the matrix sustained-release preparation according to the present invention has very little effect on the dissolution profile of the basic drug or the salt thereof from the matrix type sustained-release preparation.<br>
The present invention also provides a method of reducing pH dependence of dissolution of a basic drug or a salt thereof at a dissolution time of 2 to 3 hours corresponding to gastric emptying time (at the early stage of the dissolution test) by mixing the basic drug or the salt thereof, the solubility of which is higher in the 0.1 N hydrochloric solution and the neutral aqueous solution, pH 6.0 than in the basic aqueous solution, pH 8.0 with at least one enteric polymer, and then compression-molding the mixture. The method for manufacturing the matrix type sustained-release preparation according to the present invention may also comprise adding at<br>
least one water-insoluble polymer.  That is, the present invention provides a method of reducing pH dependence of dissolution of the basic drug or the salt thereof at a dissolution time of 2 to 3 hours corresponding to gastric emptying time (at the early stage of the dissolution test) by mixing the basic drug or the salt thereof, the solubility of which is higher in the 0.1 N hydrochloric solution and the neutral aqueous solution, pH 6.0 than in the basic aqueous solution, pH 8.0 with at least one enteric polymer and at least one water insoluble polymer, and then compression-molding the mixture.<br>

The method for manufacturing the matrix type sustained-release preparation according to the present invention may also comprise adding at least one water-insoluble polymer. That is, the present invention provides a method of reducing pH dependence of dissolution of the basic drug or the salt thereof at a dissolution time of 2 to 3 hours corresponding to gastric emptying time (at the early stage of the dissolution test) by mixing the basic drug or the salt thereof, the solubility of which is higher in the 0.1 N hydrochloric solution and the 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.0 than in the 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 8.0 with at least one enteric polymer and at least one water insoluble polymer, and then compression-molding the mixture.<br>

The matrix type sustained-release preparation according to the present invention can be manufactured by, for example, the following methods. 130g of donepezil hydrochloride (Eisai Co. Ltd.), 624 g of Ethocel 10FP (ethylcellulose, Dow Chemical Company), 780 g of Eudragit L100-55 (Rohm GmbH &amp; Co. KG) and 988 g of lactose are mixed in a granulator.

After sizing, 1 g of magnesium stearate (Mallinckrodt Baker, Inc.) based on 99 g of the granule is added and mixed, and a rotary tabletting machine can then be used to obtain tablets with 8 mm in diameter containing 10 mg of donepezil hydrochloride in 200 mg of the tablet.

(Experimental Example 1)<br>
In a matrix type sustained-release preparation according to the present invention, effects of an enteric polymer in the presence of a water-insoluble on dissolution behavior are evaluated in the following.<br>
Matrix type sustained-release preparations were prepared using donepezil hydrochloride according to Comparative Example 1, and Examples 2 and 4 which are given below, and dissolution tests were performed thereon. Note that the matrix type sustained-release preparations were prepared using ethylcellulose as a water-insoluble polymer and Eudragit L100-55 as an enteric polymer. The ratios of ethylceliulose to Eudragit L100-55 in Comparative Example 1, and Examples 2 and 4 were 25%: 0% by weight, 25%: 25% by weight and 25% : 50% by weight, respectively. Further, the dissolution tests were performed in the following two types of test solutions at a paddle frequency of 50 rpm in accordance with the dissolution test methods of the Japanese Pharmacopoeia, Ed. 14. The dissolution tests were<br>
carried out by use of a test solution A as an acidic test solution and a rest solution B as a neutral test solution as set forth below.<br>
Test solution A:       0.1 N hydrochloric acid solution<br>
Test solution B:      50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.8 (buffer of 50 mM sodium phosphate solution with a pH adjusted with hydrochloric acid to be from pH 6.75 to pH 6.84)<br>
Note that dissolution rate was calculated from concentrations of donepezil hydrochloride in sample solutions collected with dissolution time and analyzed by a spectrophotometric method or HPLC analysis method. The spectrophotometric method was performed under measurement conditions of measurement wavelength at 315 nm, reference wavelength at 650 nm. HPLC analysis method was performed under measurement conditions of measurement column: Inertsil ODS-2 (GL Science), mobile phase: water/acetonitrile/70% aqueous perchloric acid solution = 650/350/1 mixture, and detection wavelength at 271 nm. Comparative results of the dissolution tests are shown in Figures 1 and 2, and results for Comparative Example 1 and Examples 2 and 4 in Tables 1 and 2.<br>
[Table 1]<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
 [Table 2]<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
In Comparative Example 1, and Examples 2 and 4, the weight percentage of Eudragit L100-55 in the tablets varied under a constant 25% by weight of<br>
ethylcellulose per 100% by weight of the tablets (0%, 25%, 50% by weight of<br>
Eudragit L100-55 per 100% by weight of the tablets, respectively). As shown in Figures 1 and 2, it was confirmed that in dissolution tests using the same test solutions under the same conditions, the greater the content (content percentage) of the enteric polymer (Eudragit L100-65), the slower the dissolution of donepezll hydrochloride from the matrix sustained-release preparation according to the present invention.<br>
In the matrix sustained-release preparation according to the present invention, when both the enteric polymer and the water-insoluble polymer are mixed in the preparation, the greater the amount of the enteric polymer mixed with the water-insoluble polymer, the more the dissolution speed is reduced, thus allowing a long-acting sustained-release preparation to be prepared.<br>
(Experimental Example 2)<br>
Set out below are the effects of ensuring dissolution with low pH dependence in the matrix type sustained-release preparation, at the same time, of reducing the ratio of dissolution rate of a basic drug or a salt thereof in an acidic test solution to the dissolution rate in a neutral test solution (dissolution rate in the acidic test solution / dissolution rate in the neutral test solution) in a dissolution test, as the dissolution tests proceed.<br>
First, Eudragit L100-55 was used as the enteric polymer and ethylcellulose was used as the water-insoluble polymer in the matrix sustained-release preparation.<br>
Matrix type sustained release preparations were prepared using donepezil hydrochloride according to Comparative Example 1, and Examples 1 through 11 and 14 through 17 below, and dissolution tests were performed thereon. The dissolution tests were performed to evaluate preparations in which the amounts of donepezil<br>
hydrochloride, the enteric polymer and the water-insoluble polymer varied (in Examples 1 to 6), in which the type of diluents varied (in Examples 5 and 7), in which wet granulation was performed using a binder (in Examples 8,11 and 14 to 17, and 20), in which the type of ethylcellulose varied (in Examples 5, 9 and 10) and in which the scale-up production was carried out (in Examples 11, 14 to 17). Note that a preparation containing donepezil hydrochloride and the water-insoluble polymer as its main components without any enteric polymer was used as Comparative Example 1. The results for Comparative Example 1 and Examples 1, 2 to 6, 7 to 11 and 14 to 17 and 20 are shown in Tables 1,2, 3 and 4, respectively. Comparative dissolution test results for Examples 14 to 17 are shown in Figures 3 and 4.<br>
[Table 3]<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
[Table 4]<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
In the case of the matrix type sustained-release preparation of Comparative Example 1, which contained no the enteric polymer, the ratio of dissolution rate in the acidic test solution to dissolution rate in the neutral test solution (dissolution rate in the acidic test solution / dissolution rate in the neutral test solution) increased slightly from a dissolution time of 1 hour to a dissolution time of 2 to 3 hours at the early stage, and the ratio subsequently remained at about 1.5 with little change thereof at the late stage of dissolution. On the other hand, in the preparations of all examples (Examples 1 to 11, Examples 14 to 17) in which the enteric polymer Eudragit L100-55 was contained, the ratio of the dissolution rate decreased from a dissolution time of 1 hour to a dissolution time of 2 to 3 hours, and continued to decrease gradually as the dissolution test proceeded, until completion of the dissolution test or until a dissolution time at which the dissolution rate in the neutral test solution was 90% or more. The ratio of dissolution rates was from 0.6 to 1.3 at a dissolution time of 3 hours in these cases. That is, by mixing the enteric polymer into the preparation, the preparation according to the present invention can provide a preparation in which the dissolution rate in the acidic test solution is inhibited at the early stage of dissolution (corresponding to the gastric retention period), while reducing pH dependence of the basic drug or the salt thereof, and with which a higher dissolution rate in the neutral test solution relative to the dissolution rate in the acidic test solution can be achieved at the late stage of dissolution (which is thought to correspond to the small intestinal retention stage). The both effects at the early and the late stages of dissolution were confirmed with all preparations in which the amounts of donepezil hydrochloride, enteric polymer and water-insoluble polymer varied (in Examples 1 to 6), in which the type of diluents varied (in Examples 5 and 7), in which wet granulation was achieved with a binder (in Examples 8,11,14 to 17, and 20), in which the type of ethylcellulose<br>
varied (in Examples 5, 9,10) and in which the manufacturing scale was altered (in Examples 11,14 to 17, and 20). in Examples 11 and 14 to 16, in particular, because 90% or more of the drug was released in the 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.8 within 8 hours which is the estimated as the upper limit of large intestinal arrival time in humans (Int. J. Pharm. Vol. 53,1989,107 to 117), there is little risk of decreased bioavailability due to the sustained release characteristics and it is believed that these preparations are extremely useful.<br>
(Experimental Example 3)<br>
In this experimental example, types of the enteric and the water-insoluble polymers were evaluated for the matrix type sustained-release preparation. First, set out below are experimental examples of the matrix type sustained-release preparations in which hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate was used as the enteric polymer and ethylcellulose as the water-insoluble polymer. The matrix type sustained-release preparations were prepared using donepezil hydrochloride according to Comparative Example 2, and Examples 12 and 13 which are given below, and dissolution tests were performed thereon. Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate (AQOAT LF or AQOAT MF; Shin-Etsu Chemical) was used as the enteric polymer and ethylcellulose was used as the water insoluble polymer in the matrix type sustained-release preparations. Note that the amount of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate as the enteric polymer in the preparations was 50% based on the total weight of the preparation.<br>
A preparation containing the same amounts of donepezil hydrochloride and the water-insoluble polymer as in Examples 12 and 13 but no enteric polymer was used as Comparative Examples 2. Comparative results of the dissolution tests are<br>
shown in Figures 5 and 6, and results for Comparative Example 2, and Examples 12 and 13 are shown in Tables 5. [Table 5]<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
As shown in Figures 5 and 6, it was confirmed that dissolution speed of donepezil hydrochloride in an acidic solution was dramatically retarded as a result of addition of 50% enteric polymer (AQOAT LF or AQOAT MF; Shin-Etsu Chemical) to the matrix type sustained-release preparation. In the matrix type sustained-release preparation according to the present invention, the greater the amount of the enteric polymer mixed with the water-insoluble polymer in the preparation containing the<br><br>
enteric polymer and the water-insoluble polymer, the more dissolution speed can be retarded, thus allowing an long-acting sustained-release preparation to be prepared. With the matrix type sustained-release preparation of Comparative Example 2, which did not contain the enteric polymer, the dissolution rate in the acidic test solution reached 90% at a dissolution time of 2 hours, and the ratio of dissolution rate in the acidic test solution to dissolution rate in the neutral test solution (dissolution rate in the acidic test solution / dissolution rate in the neutral test solution) remained roughly constant at 1.3 at the early stage of dissolution (1 to 3 hours), while in the preparations (Examples 12 and 13) in which 50.0% of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate (AQOAT LF or AQOAT MF; Shin-Etsu Chemical) as the enteric polymer was mixed in the preparation, the ratio of the dissolution rate indicated 0.38 to 0.55, which was lower than that in Comparative Example 2. That is, the mixture of the enteric polymer had the effect of retarding the dissolution rate of the drug in the . acidic and neutral test solutions at the early stage of dissolution and in particular of dramatically retarding the dissolution rate of the drug in the acidic test solution, thus bringing the dissolution rates in the two solutions closer to each other and reducing pH dependence. Moreover, at the late stage of dissolution it also had the effect of retarding dissolution in the acidic test solution while increasing dissolution in the neutral test solution. This suggests that the risk of adverse events due to the 'sustained release characteristics at the early stage of dissolution can be reduced, and the risk of reduced bioavailability can be inhibited in these preparations. Accordingly, it was confirmed that by setting the added amount of hydroxypropyl cellulose acetate succinate (AQOAT LF or AQOAT MF; ShirvEtsu Chemical) to an appropriate value between 0 and 50%, it is possible to design a preparation in which dissolution behavior with the ratio of dissolution rate in the acidic test solution to<br>
dissolution rate in the neutral test solution (dissolution rate in the acidic test solution / dissolution rate in the neutral test solution) being near 1 at the early stage of dissolution can be ensured and in which this ratio of dissolution rates can be decreased until the dissolution rate in a neutral solution reaches 90% or more at the late stage of dissolution.<br>
Next, Table 6 shows that effects of a combination of ethylcellulose and Eudragit L100 on dissolution behavior of the preparation. As compared to Comparative Example 1 which contains 25 % of ethylcellulose, it was confirmed in the case of Example 21 which contains 25 % of ethylcellulose and 50 % of Eudragit L100 that a ratio of dissolution rate of the drug or the salt thereof in the acidic test solution to dissolution rate of the drug or the salt thereof in the neutral test solution (dissolution rate in the acidic test solution / dissolution rate in the neutral test solution) decreased with dissolution time. [Table 6]<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
Moreover, effects of Eudragit RSPO as the water-insoluble polymer on the dissolution behavior of the preparation were also evaluated in the following: As shown in table 7, Comparative Example 3 which does not contain the enteric polymer but contain Eudragit RSPO exhibited a drug burst behavior and no effect of sustained-release characteristics of the drug. However, it was confirmed in Examples 22 and 23 which contains Eudragit L100 and AQOAT LF, respectively that dissolution time was prolonged in both test solution A and test solution B, and effect of sustained-release characteristics was accomplished by mixing the enteric polymer into the preparation in these Examples. Further, in Examples 22 and 23, a ratio of dissolution rate of the drug or the salt thereof in the acidic test solution to dissolution rate of the drug or the salt thereof in the neutral test solution (dissolution rate in the acidic test solution / dissolution rate in the neutral test solution) exhibited 0.34 and 0.7 at the dissolution time of 3 hour, respectively, and it was confirmed that the above ratio of the dissolution rate of the drug or the salt thereof in the acidic solution to dissolution rate of the drug or the salt thereof in the neutral solution decreased with dissolution time after dissolution time of 3 hour. In particular, Example 23 showed that 90% or more of the drug was released in the 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.8 within 8 hours which is the estimated as the upper limit of large intestinal arrival time in humans and it is believed that the preparation according to Example 23 is extremely useful.<br>
[Table 7]<br>

 (Experimental Example 4)<br>
The dissolution tests were carried out using tablets prepared in Examples 27 to 31. The results of the dissolution tests are shown in Table 8 and in Figures 7 to 9. According to the present invention, it is evident that the matrix type sustained-release preparation has the properties of ensuring dissolution with low pH dependence of the<br>
basic drug or the salt thereof at the early stage of dissolution and of allowing the ratio of dissolution rate of the basic drug or the salt thereof in the acidic test solution to the dissolution rate of the basic drug or the salt thereof in the neutral test solution (dissolution rate in the acidic test solution / dissolution rate in the neutral test solution) to be decreased at the late stage of dissolution, as the dissolution test proceeds. The these preparations exhibited that 90% or more of the drug was released in the 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.8 within 8 hours which is the estimated as the upper limit of large intestinal arrival time in humans and it is believed that these preparations are extremely useful.<br>
[Table 8]<br>

 (Experimental Example 5)<br>
In order to evaluate dissolution behavior of the pharmaceutical composition containing memantine hydrochloride, dissolution tests were carried out using the preparations obtained in the following Examples and Comparative Examples. The dissolution tests were performed in the following two types of test solutions at a paddle frequency of 50 rpm in accordance with the dissolution test methods of the Japanese Pharmacopoeia, Ed. 14. The dissolution tests were carried out by use of a test solution A as an acidic test solution and a test solution B as a neutral test solution as set forth below.<br>
Test solution A:       0.1 N hydrochloric acid solution<br>
Test solution B:      50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.8 (buffer of 50 mM sodium phosphate solution with a pH adjusted with hydrochloric acid to be from pH 6.75 to pH 6.84)<br>
Note that dissolution rate was calculated from concentrations of memantine hydrochloride in sample solutions collected with dissolution time and analyzed by a HPLC analysis method after memantine hydrochloride was fluorescent labeled by Fluorescamine. The conditions for fluorescence labeling and HPLC analysis are typically as follows: After sample solutions (1 mL) collected with dissolution time was mixed with borate buffer, pH 9.0 (USP, 9mL), an acetone solution (5 mL) containing Fluorescamine (1.2 mg/mL) was added and stirred enough. Water (10 mL) was also added into the above solution and mixed to obtain a test sample. The test sample was analyzed by HPLC. HPLC analysis was performed under measurement conditions of measurement column: CAPCELL PAK UG120 C18<br>
(Shiseido) or a similar column, column temperature: 40°C, mobile phase: borate buffer, pH 9.0 (USP)/acetonitrile = 60/40 mixture, and detection conditions: fluorescence detector (excitation wavelength / detection wavelength = 391 nm / 474nm).<br>
The dissolution tests were performed using tablets obtained in Examples 40 to 42 and Comparative Example 4, in order to evaluate effects of an enteric polymer on the preparations containing memantine hydrochloride and ethylcellulose as the water-insoluble polymer.<br>
Comparative Example 4 which does not contain the enteric polymer but contain ethylcellulose showed that a dissolution rate of memantine hydrochloride was inhibited to be from 30 to 40% at the dissolution time of 1 hour, but a ratio of dissolution rate of the drug or the salt thereof in the acidic test solution to dissolution rate of the drug or the salt thereof in the neutral test solution (dissolution rate in the acidic test solution / dissolution rate in the neutral test solution) was constant without change in the dissolution time. On the other hand, Examples 40 to 42 which contain the enteric polymer showed that dissolution rate of memantine hydrochloride at the early stage of the dissolution was much lower than that in Comparative Example 4, and it was confirmed that dissolution rate of memantine hydrochloride could be inhibited at the early stage of dissolution. Moreover, it was also confirmed in these Examples that the ratio of dissolution rate of the drug or the salt thereof in the acidic test solution to dissolution rate of the drug or the salt thereof in the neutral test solution (dissolution rate in the acidic test solution / dissolution rate in the neutral test solution) decreased with the dissolution time.<br>
[Table 9]<br>

Next, dissolution tests were performed using tablets obtained in Example 43 and Comparative Example 5, in order to evaluate effects of an enteric polymer on dissolution behavior of the preparations containing memantine hydrochloride and Eudragit RSPO as the water-insoluble polymer.<br>
Comparative Example 5 which does not contain the enteric polymer but contain Eudragit RSPO showed that a dissolution rate of memantine hydrochloride in the acidic and the neutral test solutions was not less than 90% at 2 hours, a ratio of dissolution rate of the drug or the salt thereof in the acidic test solution to dissolution rate of the drug or the salt thereof in the neutral test solution (dissolution rate in the<br>
acidic test solution / dissolution rate in the neutral test solution) was constant without change in the dissolution time. On the other hand, Example 43 which contains the enteric polymer showed that dissolution rate of memantine hydrochloride at the early stage of the dissolution was much lower than that in Comparative Example 5, and it was confirmed that dissolution rate of memantine hydrochloride could be inhibited at the early stage of dissolution. Moreover, it was also confirmed in Example 43 that the ratio of dissolution rate of the drug or the salt thereof in the acidic test solution to dissolution rate of the drug or the salt thereof in the neutral test solution (dissolution rate in the acidic test solution / dissolution rate in the neutral test solution) decreased with the dissolution time.
