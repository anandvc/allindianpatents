				<td>SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR MOUNTING A PLATE TO AN ADHESIVE MEMBER<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] The present invention relates in one embodiment to the printing industry and more<br>
specifically, relates to a method for mounting a printing plate in a circular manner in near<br>
perfect alignment more easily and inexpensively, thereby providing near perfect alignment<br>
of the resultant printed image.<br>
BACKGROUND INFORMATION<br>
[0002] The printing industry now nearly exclusively utilizes photographic or digitally<br>
imaged printing plates to produce a printed image. Although this invention is primarily<br>
aimed at Flexographic printing, it could be used for letterpress and offset printing, rotary<br>
screen printing as well as in any operation were it is desirable to wrap a flat planar item<br>
around a concave or convex (oval, a round, etc.) cylinder. In some instances, these "printing<br>
plates" are utilized only one time since the printed image will generally change with the<br>
printing job while in other instances, the printing plates will be re-used and are therefore<br>
saved.<br>
[0003] Most printing presses utilize a circular drum (commonly called the "plate cylinder")<br>
on which the printing plate is mounted. By rotating the plate cylinder and printing plate first<br>
in contact with ink and next in contact with the substrate to be printed (paper, plastic, foil,<br><br>
etc.), the image is transferred from the plate to the paper. In the offset lithography process, a<br>
transfer drum called the "blanket" is between the printing plate and the printed substrate.<br>
[0004] When printing a one color product, proper alignment of the printing plate on the<br>
drum is important to maintain proper orientation to the substrate. When printing in multiple<br>
colors, the printing press must have one rotating drum and printing plate assembly for each<br>
color to be printed. In such cases, proper alignment ("registration") of the printing plates on<br>
the drums is essential otherwise, the finished product will have improperly aligned images<br>
and colors in addition to improper alignment to the substrate.<br>
[0005] In flexographic printing, the plate is usually attached to an expensive plate cylinder<br>
using double sided tape called "stickyback". Stickyback has either a solid (usually rubber or<br>
polymer) core or foam core with adhesive applied to both sides. If a plate is to be used in a<br>
subsequent run of the same or similar product, it may be desirable to keep it mounted on the<br>
cylinder.<br>
[0006] Since this would tie up that expensive cylinder making it not available for other jobs,<br>
an alternative has been employed where the plate is mounted on an intermediate shell or<br>
sleeve which slides on and off the plate cylinder. These sleeves are usually metal or some<br>
plastic or composite material. While less costly than plate cylinders, sleeves are still quite<br>
expensive. Many printers have cited the benefits of sleeve mounting, but do not use it<br>
because of the high sleeve cost per unit and because a large inventory of blank sleeves<br>
matched in diameter to the various sizes of plate cylinders in stock must be maintained to<br>
accommodate new jobs as they are scheduled.<br><br>
[0007] The alignment accuracy of the plates is critical to high quality printing and<br>
minimizing waste due to mis-alignment or "mis-register". Substrate and ink waste are<br>
usually large expenses to printing companies and they constantly try to minimize this waste.<br>
Lower waste also means shorter production time and thus reduced labor and overhead costs.<br>
A number of plate mounting systems are commercially available to mount plates directly on<br>
the cylinders or onto the sleeves. These systems generally utilize a method of alignment of<br>
two points on the surface of the plate, making the assumption that if all multiple images are<br>
in registration relative to two points, the entire composite multi color (or multi plate)image<br>
will be in registration. The systems generally use CCD cameras or microscopes to achieve<br>
this alignment. Some systems employ attachment points (holes or protrusions) which can be<br>
mechanically aligned. The same systems are used to mount plates on to plate cylinders or<br>
sleeves, so the current use of sleeves does nothing to improve the registration accuracy.<br>
[0008] These systems have served the industry well, but they have some limitations. First,<br>
not all cylinders are exactly of the same diameter. Diametric differences can be introduced<br>
by the stickyback. Therefore, even if the leading or trailing edges or central region of the<br>
plates are aligned, there is no guarantee that the following and trailing portion are registered<br>
(aligned). Also, there is no way to assure that the individual who mounts the plates uses the<br>
same pressure, which can introduce variability.<br>
[0009] Accordingly, what is needed is a new system and method for forming a printing plate<br>
mounted on a sleeve which is both highly accurate and inexpensive.<br><br>
[0010] The present invention features a novel system and method for forming and adhering<br>
a photographic or digitally generated printing plate or other generally flat, planar object into<br>
a circular member that can then be inserted onto the drum of a printing press or other device.<br>
The invention assumes that the printing plate will have imaged thereon a minimum of one<br>
and preferably two or more alignment marks. These alignment marks ensure that the<br>
printing plate can be mounted in a circular manner with proper alignment between the marks<br>
to prevent image misalignment and image skew.<br>
[0011] The present method provides, in addition to a printing plate, an adhesive member.<br>
The adhesive member, typically made of any combination of metal, polymer foam, solid<br>
polymer, rubber, etc, includes an adhesive layer on at least one side. In some embodiments,<br>
there maybe an adhesive layer on the second side as well. The adhesive member has<br>
approximately the same lateral dimensions as the printing plate, but may be thicker or<br>
thinner. In one embodiment, the piece of member may be provided as a flat, generally<br>
planar member having adhesive on at least one surface. In another preferred embodiment,<br>
the adhesive member may be provided at least somewhat "pre-formed" or bent into a<br>
generally circular form. The adhesive member may be a single or multilayered structure.<br>
[0012] In one embodiment, the present invention begins by exposing at least a portion of the<br>
adhesive on one surface of the adhesive member and proximate a first edge of the adhesive<br>
sheet.  The area immediate to the first edge is covered with a release layer that prevents<br><br>
sticking to the adhesive. Next, the photographic plate or other flat generally planar object is<br>
attached to the adhesive sheet proximate but not at the edge of the adhesive member. This<br>
attachment leaves a region of the adhesive sheet back from the edge to which nothing yet is<br>
attached. This dimension of edge can range from approximately V" inch to 2" inches in<br>
width, although this is not a limitation of the present invention.<br>
[0013] The printing plate is secured to the remainder of the adhesive sheet. This now leaves<br>
a section of printing plate which has not yet been attached to the adhesive sheet because of<br>
the offset in the initial attachment point.<br>
[0014] The partially adhered printing plate and adhesive sheet are next rolled into a circular<br>
form and held in place in a printing plate mounting device. Using either a manual or<br>
automatic alignment process using equipment such as a microscope, camera, clamp,<br>
automated vision system or the like, the registration marks located on each end of the<br>
printing plate are properly aligned, the release sheet removed from proximate the first end,<br>
and finally the second end of the printing plate is adhered to the first end of the adhesive<br>
sheet thus forming a circular "sleeve" which can subsequently be mounted on a printing<br>
press drum. Using this method, each and every printing plate will be arranged in a circular<br>
format ready to be mounted on a printing press drum in perfect alignment thereby essentially<br>
eliminating misalignment or skew caused by improperly aligned printing plates.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0021] The present invention features a novel system and method for forming a<br>
photographically or digitally generated printing plate or other generally flat, planar object<br>
into a circular sleeve that can then be inserted onto the drum of a printing press or other<br>
device.  The invention assumes that the printing plate 10, Fig. 2, will have imaged or<br><br>
otherwise placed thereon one or more and preferably four (4) alignment marks 12 in<br>
addition to the indicia 14 (text and/or images) to be printed. Although the present invention<br>
will be explained in connection with the flexography method of printing, this is not a<br>
limitation of the present invention.<br>
[0022] Flexography is a "relief printing process meaning that the image portion of the plate<br>
is raised above the "floor" of the plate (such as a rubber stamp). The "letterpress" method is<br>
also a relief printing process whereas offset lithography plates are essentially planar and rely<br>
on the chemistry of the printing area. The present invention applies equally well to all the<br>
above referenced printing technologies and to other areas of technology unrelated to<br>
printing.<br>
[0023] The alignment or registration marks may be two-dimensional marks imaged on the<br>
surface of the printing plate or other generally flat, planar object to be aligned. The two-<br>
dimensional marks may include a specific design, such as a dot, cross hair mark or the like,<br>
to aid alignment. The alignment or registration marks 12 may also include three-<br>
dimensional marks protruding from the generally flat planar surface of the object to be<br>
aligned. The tops of these protrusions may also include an alignment aid such as a dot,<br>
crosshair mark or the like. The alignment marks 12 ensure that the printing plate can be<br>
mounted in a circular manner with proper alignment between the marks to prevent image<br>
misalignment and image skew. Although two marks are contemplated as a minimum, there<br>
are preferably provided four alignment marks.  In addition, only one alignment mark or<br><br>
region having one or more alignment features may be provided, all without departing from<br>
the scope of the present invention.<br>
[0024] The present method provides, in addition to a printing plate 10, an adhesive member<br>
16, Fig 1. The adhesive member 16, typically made of any combination of metal, polymer<br>
foam, solid polymer, rubber, etc, includes an adhesive layer 17 on at least one surface, such<br>
as surface 18. In some embodiments, there maybe an adhesive layer on the second surface<br>
as well. The adhesive member 16 has approximately the same lateral dimensions (length<br>
and width) as the printing plate 10 but may be of a different thickness.<br>
[0025] The present invention begins by exposing at least a portion of the adhesive 17 on one<br>
surface 18 of the adhesive member 16. Typically, the one surface 18 will be covered by a<br>
thin silicone paper or similar release sheet 19. Alternatively, the one surface 18 of the<br>
adhesive member may covered by a release sheet in two sections; one larger sheet covering<br>
most of the surface 18 and the other, a smaller release sheet 19 disposed only in the region<br>
24 of the adhesive member 16 that will not have the plate 10 attached to it at this time<br>
(much like the pull tabs used in printed toner cartridges.)<br>
[0026] Next, the plate 10 is attached to the adhesive sheet 16 proximate but not directly at<br>
one edge 20 of the adhesive member 16. This attachment method leaves a region 24 of the<br>
adhesive sheet 16 back from the edge 20 to which nothing yet is attached. The dimension of<br>
the region 24 is preferably 1 inch although this dimension can range from approximately lA<br>
inch to 2 inches in width, however this is not a limitation of the present invention. This pre-<br>
assembly process will preferably be done on a cylinder because the final sleeve is cylindrical<br><br>
and the laminated construction described will resist significant bending although this is not<br>
a limitation on the invention.<br>
[0027] The printing plate 10 is secured to the remainder of the adhesive sheet 16. This now<br>
leaves a section of printing plate 26 which has not yet been attached to the adhesive sheet 16<br>
because of the offset 24 in the initial attachment point. The dimension of region 24 and 26<br>
are generally the same. The partially adhered printing plate 10 and adhesive sheet 16 are<br>
next rolled into a circular form 30, Fig. 3, (typically on a circular form or "mandrel" type of<br>
assembly and/or alignment device, as would be appreciated by those of skill in the art) and<br>
held in place using, for example, a sleeve assembly device 40, Fig. 5 using clamps 42 (or<br>
suction on the cylinder or some other means) and the like. The ends of the structure before<br>
final assembly are allowed to move towards each other in the direction indicated generally<br>
by arrows 15. The printing sleeve assembly device 40 will allow the alignment marks 12 to<br>
be viewed accurately (such as under one or more microscopes 44 or using a machine vision<br>
system utilizing cameras) and moved incrementally in any direction necessary to properly<br>
align the ends of the printing plate 10 before adhering the second end 26 of the plate 10 to<br>
the adhesive member 16 in the region 24.<br>
[0028] Using either a manual or automatic alignment process using, for example,<br>
micrometers 43 and using equipment such as a microscope, camera, automated vision<br>
system or the like, the one or more registration marks 12 located on or near each end of the<br>
printing plate 10 are properly aligned and finally the second end region 26 of the printing<br>
plate is adhered to the first end region 24 of the adhesive member 16 after removing release<br><br>
sheet 19, thus forming a cylindrical "sleeve" 30 which can subsequently be mounted on a<br>
printing press drum.<br>
[0029] In the preferred embodiment, the adhesive member 16 is provided in a circular or at<br>
least partially circular form. This is particularly necessary when the adhesive member 16 is<br>
a multilayered structure including two or more layers.  In that case, the multilayered<br>
adhesive member 16 must be assembled in a generally circular form otherwise the<br>
multilayered structure 16 will be too resistant to bending and will not be able to be formed<br>
in a circular manner once the generally flat planar object is adhered to it as one or more of<br>
the assemblies will "buckle" and not properly form.<br>
[0030] In this and other embodiments, it will be desirable to pre-form the adhesive member<br>
16 into a generally circular form before adhering the generally flat, planar object 10 to its<br>
surface, although the alignment methodology described above will work equally as well<br>
with a circular adhesive member 16. As those of ordinary skill in the art will know, other<br>
adhering methodologies may also be used without departing from the scope of the present<br>
invention.<br>
[0031] Using this system and method, each and every generally flat, planar object with<br>
alignment marks such as printing plates will be arranged in a circular format ready to be<br>
mounted on a printing press drum in perfect alignment thereby essentially eliminating<br>
misalignment and/or skew caused by improperly aligned printing plates.<br>
[0032] It is important to note that the present invention is not intended to be limited to a<br>
system or method which must satisfy one or more of any stated objects or features of the<br><br>
invention. It is also important to note that the present invention is not limited to the<br>
preferred, exemplary, or primary embodiment(s) described herein. Modifications and<br>
substitutions by one of ordinary skill in the art are considered to be within the scope of the<br>
present invention, which is not to be limited except by any allowed claims and their legal<br>
equivalents.<br><br>
