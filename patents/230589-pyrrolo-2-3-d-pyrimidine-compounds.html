				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Background of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine compounds which are inhibitors of protein tyrosine kinases, such as the enzyme Janus Kinase 3 (hereinafter also referred to as JAK3) and as such are useful therapy as immunosuppressive agents for organ transplants, lupus, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, Type I diabetes and complications from diabetes, cancer, asthma, atopic dermatitis, autoimmune thyroid disorders, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Leukemia and other indications where immunosuppression would be desirable.<br>
This invention also relates to a method of using such compounds in the treatment of the above indications in mammals, especially humans, and the phamaceutical compositions useful therefor.<br>
JAK3 is a member of the Janus family of protein tyrosine kinases. Although the other members of this family are expressed by essentially all tissues, JAK3 expression is limited to hematopoetic cells. This is consistent with its essential role in signaling through the receptors for IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9 and IL-15 by non-covalent association of JAK3 with the gamma chain common to these multichain receptors. XSCID patient populations have been identified with severely reduced levels of JAK3 protein or with genetic defects to the common gamma chain, suggesting that immunosuppression should result from blocking signaling through the JAK3 pathway. Animal studies have suggested that JAK3 not only plays a critical role in B and T lymphocyte maturation, but that JAK3 is constitutively required to maintain T cell function. Modulation of immune activity through this novel mechanism can prove useful in the treatment of T cell proliferative disorders such as transplant rejection and autoimmune diseases.<br>

of formula XXVI may be further reacted with an oxidizing agent known to one of ordinary skill in the art, such as hydrogen peroxide, oxone, 3-chloroperoxybenzoic acid or tert-butylperoxide to generate the corresponding 4- R9 sulfinylpyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine or 4- R9 sulfonylpyrrolo compounds.<br>
The compounds of the present invention that are basic in nature are capable of forming a wide variety of different salts with various inorganic and organic acids. Although such salts must be pharmaceutically acceptable for administration to animals, it is often desirable in practice to initially isolate the compound of the present invention from the reaction mixture as a pharmaceutically unacceptable salt and then simply convert the latter back to the free base compound by treatment with an alkaline reagent and subsequently convert the latter free base to a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt. The acid addition salts of the base compounds of this invention are readily prepared by treating the base compound with a substantially equivalent amount of the chosen mineral or organic acid in an aqueous solvent medium or in a suitable organic solvent, such as methanol or ethanol. Upon careful evaporation of the solvent, the desired solid salt is readily obtained. The desired acid salt can also be precipitated from a solution of the free base in an organic solvent by adding to the solution an appropriate mineral or organic acid.<br>
Those compounds of the present invention that are acidic in nature, are capable of forming base salts with various pharmacologically acceptable cations. Examples of such salts include the alkali metal or alkaline-earth metal salts and particularly, the sodium and potassium salts. These salts are all prepared by conventional techniques. The chemical bases which are used as reagents to prepare the pharmaceutically acceptable base salts of this invention are those which form non-toxic base salts with the acidic compounds of the present invention. Such non-toxic base salts include those derived from such pharmacologically acceptable cations as sodium, potassium calcium and magnesium, etc. These salts can easily be prepared by treating the corresponding acidic compounds with an aqueous solution containing the desired pharmacologically acceptable cations, and then evaporating the resulting solution to dryness, preferably under reduced pressure. Alternatively, they may also be prepared by mixing lower alkanolic solutions of the acidic compounds and the desired alkali metal alkoxide together, and then evaporating the resulting solution to dryness in the same manner as before. In either case, stoichiometric quantities of reagents are preferably employed in order to ensure completeness of reaction and maximum yields of the desired final product.<br>

Biological Assay JAK3 (JH1:GST) Enzymatic Assay<br>
The JAK3 kinase assay utilizes a protein expressed in baculovirus-infected SF9 cells (a fusion protein of GST and the catalytic domain of human JAK3) purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepaharose. The substrate for the reaction is poly-Glutamic acid-Tyrosine (PGT (4:1), Sigma catalog # P0275), coated onto Nunc Maxi Sorp plates at 100 µg/ml overnight at 37°C. The morning after coating, the plates are washed three times and JAK3 is added to the wells containing 100 ul of kinase buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.3, 125 mM NaCI, 24 mM MgCI2)+ 0.2 uM ATP + 1 mM Na orthovanadate.) The reaction proceeds for 30 minutes at room temperature and the plates is washed three more times. The level of phosphorylated tyrosine in a given well is quantitated by standard ELISA assay utilizing an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (ICN PY20, cat. #69-151-1).<br>
DND 39/IL-4 Cellular Assay for JAK3 kinase Inhibitors<br>
The DND 39/IL-4 assay is designed to find inhibitors of JAK3 kinase activity which would be prime candidates for immunosupressive and/or allergy. The assay uses a B-cell line called DND39 which has had the luciferase gene driven by the germ line IgE promoter stably integrated into one of the chromosomes. When these cells are stimulated with IL-4, the kinase JAK3, which is associated with the IL-4 receptor, phosphorylates the signal transducer STAT6. STAT6 then blinds to the germline IgE promoter and starts transcription of the luciferase gene. Luciferase is measured in a lysate of these cells using the Promega luciferase assay reagent system.<br>
Note: DND39 cells are grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FCS, 2 mM L-Glutamine, and 100 units/ml Pen./Strep. The cells are maintained from 1x105 to 1x10s cells/ml. Split to 1x10s on Friday, cells will be at about 1x106on Monday. Then split 1:2 during the week keeping 200 ml in a flask as needed.<br>
3x10s DND39 cells are plated in 100 µl of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 1% heat inactivated FCS, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 100 units/ml Pen/Step in a 96 well Vee bottom plate (Nunc). Compounds are diluted serially 1:2 in DMSO starting at 4mM to 1.9µM. In a 96 well polypropylene plate, changing tips after each dilution. Then 5µl of each dilution are added to 500µl of RPMI/1% serum in a 96 tube rack. 125 µL of the compound dilutions are added to the cells and incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 for one hour. After one hour, 25 ul of 25 ng/ml IL-4 is added to the cells and mixed. Final concentration of IL-4 is 2.5 ng/ml and final concentration of compound is from 20 uM to 156 nM. The cells are then incubated overnight 16-18 hours. The plate is then centrifuged at 2500-3000 RPM in a table top centrifuge for 5 minutes. The culture supernatant is carefully removed by aspiration with an 8 well maifold. 100 ul of PBS with calcium and magnesium is added to the pelletted cells. The cells are<br>
Resuspended in the PBS and transferred to a Packard white OptiPlate. 100 µl of Packard's LucLite reagent is added to the wells of the OptiPlate.<br>
