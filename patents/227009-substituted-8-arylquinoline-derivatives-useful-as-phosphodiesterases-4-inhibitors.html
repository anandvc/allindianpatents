FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to compounds that are substituted 8-arylquinolines. In particular, this invention is directed to substituted 8-arylqiiinolines which are phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors wherein the aryl group at the 8-position contains a substituent substituted-alkenyl group.<br>
RELATED BACKGROUND<br>
Hormones are compounds that variously affect cellular activity, lit many respects, hormones act as messengers to trigger specific cellular responses and activities. Many effects produced by hormones, however, are not caused by the singular effect of just the hormone. Instead, the hormone first binds to a receptor, thereby triggering the release of a second compound that goes on to affect the cellular activity. In this scenario, the hormone is known as the first messenger while the second compound is called the second messenger. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate {adenosine 3', 5'-cyclic monophosphate, "cAMP" or "cyclic AMP") is known as a second messenger for hormones including epinephrine, glucagon, calcitonin, corticotrophin, lipotropin, luteinizing hormone, norepinephrine, parathyroid hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and vasopressin. Thus, cAMP mediates cellular responses to hormones. Cyclic AMP also mediates cellular responses to various neurotransmitters.<br>
Phosphodiesterases ("PDE") are a family of enzymes that metabolize 3*, 5' cyclic nucleotides to 5' nucleoside monophosphates, thereby terminating cAMP second messenger activity. A particular phosphodiesterase, phosphodiesterase-4 ("PDE4", also known as "PDE-IV"), which is a high affinity, cAMP specific, type IV PDE, has generated interest as potential targets for the development of novel anti¬asthmatic and anti-inflammatory compounds. PDE4 is known to exist as at lease four<br><br>
isoenzymes, each of which is encoded by a distinct gene. Each of the four known PDE4 gene products is believed to play varying roles in allergic and/or inflammatory responses. Thus, it is believed that inhibition of PDE4, particularly the specific PDE4 isoforms that produce detrimental responses, can beneficially affect allergy and inflammation symptoms. It would be desirable to provide novel compounds and compositions that inhibit PDE4 activity.<br>
A major concern with the use of PDE4 inhibitors is the side effect of emesis which has been observed for several candidate compounds as described in CBumouf et al., ("Bumouf'), Ann. Rep. In Med. Chem., 33:91-109(1998). B.Hughes et al., Br. J.Pharmacol., 118:1183-1191(1996); M.J.Perry et al., CellBiochem. Biophys., 29:113-132(1998); S.B.Chiistensen et al., J.Med. Chem., 41:821-835(1998); and Burnouf describe the wide variation of the severity of the undesirable side effects exhibited by various compounds. As described in M-D.Houslay et al., Adv. In Pharmacol., 44:225-342(1998) and D.Spina et al., Adv. In Pharmacol, 44:3.3-89(1998), there is great interest and research of therapeutic PDE4 inhibitors,<br>
International Patent Publication W09422852 describes quinolines as PDE4 inhibitors.<br>
A.H.Cook, et al., J.Chem. Soc, 413-417(1943) describes gamma-pyridylquinolines. Other quinoline compounds are described in Kei Manabe et al., J.Org. Chem., 58£24): 6692-6700(1993); Kei Manabe et al., J.Am. Chem Soc, H502}:5324-5325(1993); and Kei Manabe et al., J.Am. Chem. Soc. 114Q7V6940-6941(1992).<br>
Compounds that include ringed systems are described by various investigators as effective for a variety of therapies and utilities. For example, International Patent Publication No. WO 98/25883 describes ketobenzamides as calpain inhibitors, European Patent Publication No. EP 811610 and U.S. Patent Nos. 5,679,712, 5,693,672 and 5,747,541 describe substituted benzoylguanidine sodium channel blockers, U.S. Patent No. 5,736,297 describes ring systems useful as a photosensitive composition.<br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 5,491,147,5,608,070,5,622,977, 5,739,144, 5,776,958, 5,780,477, 5,786,354, 5,798,373, 5,849,770, 5,859,034, 5,866,593, 5,89.! ,896, and International Patent Publication WO 95/35233 describe PDE4<br><br>
inhibitors that are tri-substituted aryl or heteroaryl phenyl derivatives. U.S. Patent No. 5,580,883 describes PDE4 inhibitors that are styryl derivatives. U.S. Patent No. 5,550,137 describes PPE4 inhibitors that are phenylaminocarbonyl derivatives. U.S. Patent No. 5,340,827 describes PDE4 inhibitors that are phenylcarboxamide compounds. U.S. Patent No. 5,780,478 describes PDE4 inhibitors that are tetra-substituted phenyl derivatives. International Patent Publication WO 96/00215 describes substituted oxime derivatives useful as PDE4 inhibitors. U.S. Patent No. 5,633,257 describes PDE4 inhibitors that are cycio(aUcyl and a]kenyl)phenyl-alkenyl (aryl and heteroaryl) compounds.<br>
However, there remains a need for novel compounds and compositions that therapeutically inhibit PDE4 with minimal side effects.<br>

For example, inflammation may be effectively treated by the administration of from about O.Olmg to 50mg of the compound per kilogram of body weight per day, or alternatively about 0.5mg to about 2.5g per patient per day. Further, it is understood that the PDE4 inhibiting compounds of this invention can be administered at prophylactically effective dosage levels to prevent the above-recited conditions.<br>
The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. For example, a formulation intended for the oral administration to humans may conveniently contain from about 0.5mg to about 5g of active agent, compounded with an appropriate and convenient amount of carrier material which may vary from about 5 to about 95 percent of the total composition. Unit dosage forms will generally contain between from about O.Olmg to about lOOOmg of the active ingredient, typically O.Olmg, 0.05mg, 0.25mg, lmg, 5mg, 25mg, 50mg, lOOmg, 200mg, 300mg, 400mg, 500mg, 600mg, SOOrng or lOOOmg.<br>
It is understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy.<br>
In practice, the compounds represented by Formula I, or pharmaceuticaliy acceptable salts thereof, of this invention can be combined as the active ingredient in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration, e.g., oral or parenteral (including intravenous). Thus, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be presented J.S discrete units suitable for oral administration<br><br>
such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient. Further, the compositions can be presented as a powder, as granules, as a solution, as a suspension in an aqueous liquid, as a non-aqueous liquid, as an oil-in-water emulsion or as a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. In addition to the common dosage forms set out above, the compound represented by Formula I, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, may also be administered by controlled release means and/or delivery devices. The compositions may be prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy. In general, such methods include a step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier that constitutes one or more necessary ingredients.

ASSAYS DEMONSTRATING BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY<br>
LPS AND FMLP-INDUCED TNF-a AND LTB4 ASSAYS IN HUMAN<br>
WHOLE BLOOD<br>
Whole blood provides a protein and cell-rich milieu appropriate for the study of biochemical efficacy of anti-inflammatory compounds such as PDE4-selective inhibitors. Normal non-stimulated human blood does not contain detectable levels of TNF-a and LTB4. Upon stimulation with LPS, activated monocytes express<br>
and secrete TNF-a up to 8 hours and plasma levels remain stable for 24 hours. Published studies have shown that inhibition of TNF-a by increasing intracellular cAMP via PDE4 inhibition and/or enhanced adenylyl cyclase activity occurs at the transcriptional level. LTB4 synthesis is also sensitive to levels of intracellular cAMP and can be completely inhibited by PDE4-selective inhibitors. As there is little LTB4<br>
produced during a 24 hour LPS stimulation of whole blood, an additional LPS stimulation followed by fMLP challenge of human whole blood is necessary for LTB4<br>
synthesis by activated neutrophils. Thus, by using the same blood sample, it is possible to evaluate the potency of a compound on two surrogate markers of PDE4 activity in the whole blood by the following procedure.<br>
Fresh blood was collected in heparinized tubes by venipuncture from healthy human volunteers (male and female). These subjects had no apparent inflammatory conditions and had not taken any NSATDs for at least 4 days prior to blood collection. SOO^L aliquots of blood were pre-incubated with either 2,uL of vehicle (DMSO) or 2^1, of test compound at varying concentrations for 15 minutes at 37°C. This was followed by the addition of either 10/JX. vehicle (PBS) as blanks or lO^LLPS (1/ig/mL final concentration, #L-2630 (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) from E. coli, serotype 0111:B4; diluted in 0.1% w/v BSA (in PBS)). After 24 hours of ircubation at 3 /°C, another 10<zl of pbs or k lps></zl><br>
final concentration) was added to blood and incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C. The blood was then challenged with either 10/iL of PBS (blank) or 10/iL of fMLP (1/iM final concentration, #F-3506 (Sigma); diluted in 1% w/v BSA (in PBS)) for 15 minutes at 37°C. The blood samples were centrifuged at 1500xg for 10 minutes at 4°C to obtain plasma. A 50/iL aliquot of plasma was mixed with 200 (iL methanol for protein precipitation and centrifuged as above. The supernatant was assayed for LTB4 using an enzyme immunoassay kit (#520111 from Cayman Chemical Co., Ann<br>
Arbor, MI) according to the manufacturer's procedure. TNF-a was assayed in diluted plasma (in PBS) using an ELISA kit (Cistron Biotechnology, Pine Brook, NJ) according to manufacturer's procedure. ThelCso values of Examples 1-42 generally<br>
ranged from 0.04uM to 8.71|JM.<br>
ANTI-ALLERGIC ACTIVITY IN VIVO<br>
Compounds of the invention have been tested for effects on an IgE-mediated allergic pulmonary inflammation induced by inhalation of antigen by sensitized guinea pigs. Guinea pigs were initially sensitized to ovalbumin under mild cyclophosphamide-induced immunosuppression, by intraperitoneal injection of antigen in combinations with aluminum hydroxide and pertussis vaccine. Booster doses of antigen were given two and four weeks later. At six weeks, animals were challenged with aerosolized ovalbumin while under cover of an intraperitoneally administered anti-histarnine agent (mepyramine). After a further 4Sh, bronchial alveolar lavages (BAL) were performed and the numbers of eosinophils and other leukocytes in the BAL fluids were counted. The lungs were also removed for histological examination for inflammatory damage. Administration of compounds of the Examples (0.001-lOmg/kg i.p. or p.o.), up to three times during the 4Sh following antigen challenge, lead to a significant reduction in the eosinophilia and the accumulation of other inflammatory leukocytes. There was also less inflammatory damage in the lungs of animals treated with compounds of the Examples.<br><br>

Alternatively the aldehyde XXVII may be converted to the unsaturated acid XXVTU by heating with XV and a base such as piperidine in a solvent such as toluene. The acid XXVIII may then be converted to the amide I (Example 27, 28 and 29) by treatment with a coupling system such as EDO, HOBt, and an amine in a solvent such as DMF.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Examples 1 and 2 were prepared by the following procedure. To a mixture of benzylphosphonate P2 (330mg, 0.83mmol) and ketone K3 (200rrtg, 0.77mmol) in THF (6mL) at r.t. was added potassium f-butoxide (IM, THF, 0.83mL, 0.83mraol). After lh at r.t., the mixture was diluted with water and extracted with Et20. The organic extracts were washed (H2O), (brine), dried (MgSO,]}, filtered and concentrated. Purification by flash chromatography (HexiEtOAc, 7:3) produced Examples 1 and 2 as white foams with one product being less polar than the other product. Example 1 was the less polar Z-isomer and Example 2 was the more polar E-isomer.<br>

Alternatively, Example 14 can be made by the following procedure:<br><br><br><br>
To methanes ulfonic acid (8-10 equiv) at 20°C was added sodium m-nitrobenzenesulfonate (0.6-0.8 equiv), followed by iron sulfate heptahydrate (0.01-0.05 equiv). To the resulting mixture was added 2-bromo-4-methylaniline (1 equiv).<br>
Glycerol (2-3 equiv) was added and the resulting solution was heated at 120-140°C and aged until the reaction was complete.<br>
The mixture was cooled to 70-90°C and diluted with water. The solution was then cooled to about 20°C, and neutralized with aqueous NaOH and sodium bicarbonate. MTBE (methyl t-butyl ether) was added and the mixture was filtered and the phases were separated (the product was in the MTBE layer).<br><br><br>
The MTBE solution from step 1 was solvent switched to chlorobenzene. After filtered through Silica gel and partially concentrated, N-bromosuccinimide (NBS, 0.6-0.8 equiv) and 2,2'-azobisisobutyliiitriIe (AIBN, 0.01-0.1 equiv) were added.

The degassed mixture was heated at about 55-85°C until xeaction completed. The mixture was cooled at 10-40°C and diluted with cyclohexane and aged. The solid was isolated by filtration.<br><br>
To a solution of bromomethyj-bromoquinoline (product from previous step, 1 equiv) in DMF was added powdered sodium methanesulfinate (1.0-1-5 equiv) at J.0-60 °C. The mixture was heated at about 50-70°C for 30min. The mixture was diluted with water while maintaining temp at about 50-70 °C with vigorous stirring, then cooled to about 10-20°C and aged. The mixture was filtered and the solid washed sequentially with 1:4 DMF/water and then water and dried.<br><br><br>
A solution of the sulfone (product from the previous step, 1 equiv) in DMF was cooled to about —10 to 0°C. Sodium t-butoxide (—1 equiv) was added . A solution of methyl iodide/DMF solution (~1 equiv of Mel) was added slowly while maintaining temperature at about -10 to 0°C.<br>
A second portion of solid sodium t-butoxide (~ 1 equiv) was added, followed by methyl iodide/DMF solution (~1 equiv) was added while maintaining the temperature at -5 to 10 °C (Additional base and Mel may be added if the reaction was not completed). The reaction was quenched by adition of water and the product crystallized, which was isolated and dried.<br><br><br>
To the mixture of hydroxy benzotriazole ("HOBt") hydrate (1-1.5 equiv), 4-methylsulfonylphenylacetic acid (1 equiv) in acetonitrile was added EDC hydrochloride (1-1.5 equiv). The slurry was aged at about 20-30°C for 30min.<br>
Other N-OH compounds, such as N-hydroxyphthalimide, 2-hydroxypyridine N-oxide, N-hydroxysuccinimide, can also.be used to replace HOBt. Other carbodiimides, such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and diisopropylcarbodiimide can be used to replace EDC hydrochloride (ethyl dimethyl armnopropylcarbodurnide hydrochloride).<br>
To the slurry was added acetarnide oxime (1-1.5 equiv). The resulting mixture was then heated at reflux until the reaction was complete. The resulting solution was concentrated and diluted with ethyl acetate. To the resulting mixture was washed with aqueous sodium bicarbonate. The solution was solvent switched to 2-propanol and product crystallized upon cooling, which was isolated and dried.<br><br><br>

As discussed above, pharmaceutically acceptable salts are often desirable. Examples of such salts are described below:<br>
General Method for Salt Preparation<br>
Salts of the compounds of this invention that are basic may be prepared in several ways:<br>
a)        The compound is dissolved in acceptable solvent such as ethyl acetate. An<br>
acceptable acid such as hydrochloric acid in an acceptable solvent such as 1,4-<br><br>
dioxane is then added. The precipitated salt slurry is aged and the salt is then isolated by filtration.<br>
b)        The compound and an acceptable acid such as benzenesulfonic acid are<br>
dissolved in an acceptable solvent such as isopropyl acetate or in a mixture of solvents such as isopropyl acetate and methanol. The salt may then be isolated by concentration or a solvent switch, leading to precipitation, followed by filtration. The more stable crystal form of the salt may be obtained by equilibration of the precipitated salt slurry by heating and aging prior to filtration. Seed crystals from previous batches may also be added prior to equilibration of the salt slurry, to initiate the process of crystallization and equilibration.<br>

FormB<br>
To a slurry of the Example 14 compound (1 equiv) in a mixture of isopropy] acetate (i-PrOAc) and methanol (1:1) was added benzenesulfonic acid (1-1.2 equiv). Other esters may be used in place of i-PrOAc and other alcohols such as ethanol or propanol may be used in place of methanol. The mixture was aged at 20 -50 °C until the solids dissolved. The resulting solution was filtered and distilled while the volume was maintained by addition of a 9:1 (v/v) mixture of i-PrOAc/methanol. The product crystallized during the distillation.<br>
Ths resulting mixture was aged at 20 - 70 °C for 2-10 h to ensure complete formation of Form B. The resulting off-white solid was isolated by filtration and dried.<br><br>
HPLC indicated a 1:1 molar ratio of 6-[ 1-methyl-1-(methyIsulfonyl)ethyl]-8-[3-[(F)-2-[3-methyl-l,2,4-oxad!azol-5-yl]-2-[4-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl}ethenyl]phenyl]quinoline and benzenesulfonic acid.<br>
