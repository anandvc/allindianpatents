				<td>A RECLOSABLE FASTNER<br>
Field of the invention<br>
This invention relates to reclosable fasteners, otherwise known as zippers, for plastics bags<br>
and other containers, and is particularly concerned with zippers intended to be applied to a film or<br>
web using cross-web techniques.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
When a zipper strip is applied to a film or web, heat and pressure are applied to effect the<br>
welding of the zipper to a film or web from which the bag or other container is to be made.<br>
In order to secure the zipper to the film or web, the zipper is conventionally provided with a<br>
plurality of flanges on the two interengageable members which together make up the fastener. The<br>
most common practice is to provide four flanges, two on each member, in order to seal these flanges<br>
to the film or web material on each side of the zipper. However, some zippers are provided with only<br>
three flanges, and some with only two. Sealing at the flanges is effected in order to keep heat and<br>
pressure away from the vulnerable male/female closure elements. However, it is a problem with such<br>
multi flanged zippers that they tend to be bulky and do not easily deflect when used in cross-web<br>
procedures.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to overcome this problem, by providing a zipper which<br>
is less bulky.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides for a reclosable fastener comprising a<br>
male/female closure between a pair of opposed base members, wherein a single flange for attachment<br>
of the closure to a web or film is provided on one only of the two base members and each base<br>
member has means to attach the fastener additionally to the web or film.<br>
The single flange is used to attach the zipper initially<br>
to the web or film for subsequent sealing/welding of the<br>
zipper to the web or film in the region of the base members,<br>
by whatever means is appropriate.<br>
Brief description of the/drawing<br>
In order that the invention may be more fully understood,<br>
one presently preferred embodiment of zipper in accordance<br>
with the invention will now be described by way of example and<br>
with reference to the accompanying drawing which is a<br>
schematic cross-sectional view through the zipper.<br>
Description of the preferred embodiment<br>
Referring to the drawing, there is shown a zipper,<br>
indicated generally at 10, comprising a first element 12 and<br>
a second element 14. The two elements 12 and 14 are generally<br>
the same as each other, apart from the fact that element 12<br>
is provided with a single elongate flange 16. Each element<br>
12, 14 comprises a base member or body portion 18 with two<br>
upstanding legs 20 which terminate in hooks 22 . The<br>
respective hooks 22 of the two elements 12 and 14 are<br>
interengageable to make the reclosable fastener.<br>
Each element 12, 14 also comprises an upstanding support<br>
post 24 at one margin. The support post 24 is slightly longer<br>
than the hooked legs 20, 2 2 so that it extends slightly beyond<br>
the tops of the legs. The upper end surface 26 of each post<br>
24 is tapered to provide an angled contact surface. Facing<br>
each support post 24, on the opposing element, there is<br>
provided a heel portion 28, again at the margin. The surface<br>
of each heel portion 28 facing the respective post 24 is<br>
shaped, i.e. angled, to be complementary to the angled contact<br>
surface 26. As can be seen from the drawing, with this<br>
arrangement, the respective posts and heels nest with one<br>
another to provide a. shape-locking configuration which tends<br>
to resist squashing or outward bending under vertical loads.<br>
The angled contact surfaces are able to absorb the welding<br>
pressure and maintain their linear integrity/ thus preventing<br>
the hooked legs 20, 22 from being squashed or distorted.<br>
In order to reduce the effects of the welding heat, each<br>
of the closure elements 12 and 14 is provided with a pair of<br>
ribs 30 on the outside face remote from the legs 20. The<br>
respective ribs 3 0 are provided again at the margins of the<br>
closure, in alignment with the posts 24 and heel portions 28.<br>
The ribs 3 0 are provided by a thickening of the material of<br>
which each of the two elements is composed. Because of the<br>
additional bulk provided by the ribs 30, they also contribute<br>
to the resistance of the closure to deformation due to<br>
pressure. On each rib 30 there is provided a layer 32 of a<br>
material which is a high-performance sealing/welding material<br>
or blend of materials, such as EVA for example. This<br>
facilitates the welding of the zipper to the adjacent web or<br>
film 34. The layers 32 are co-extruded with the closure<br>
elements 12 and 14.<br>
The single long flange 16 which is part of element 12 is<br>
arranged to face the inside of the bag or container. This<br>
single flange 16 is used for initial attachment to the film<br>
or web 34 as the zipper is applied to the web by a cross-web<br>
technique. The provision of a single long flange provides<br>
increased internal strength to the bag by altering the angle<br>
at which the load in the bag acts against the zipper closure.<br>
The flange 16 is attached to the web or film 34 by the<br>
application of heat and pressure from a sealing jaw or jaws<br>
(not shown). The flange 16 could be provided on its surface<br>
adjacent to the web or film 34 with material to facilitate the<br>
attachment of the flange to the web or film.<br>
Although the invention has been described above in<br>
relation to a particular design of zipper, it is to be<br>
understood that the invention is not to be regarded as limited<br>
to this particular design of zipper, but can be applied to<br>
zippers of other designs and having ether configurations.<br>
WE CLAIM :<br>
1. A rcclosablc fastener comprising a male/female closure between a pair of opposed base<br>
members, wherein a single flange for attachment of the closure to a web or film is provided on one<br>
only of the two base members and each base member has means to attach the fastener additionally to<br>
the w7eb or film.<br>
2. A reclosable fastener as claimed in claim 1, in which the means for additional attachment<br>
comprise ribs on the base members, the ribs being arranged to be attached to the web or film.<br>
3. A reclosable fastener as claimed in claim 2, in which the ribs are positioned at the margins of<br>
the respective base members.<br>
4. A reclosable fastener as claimed in claim 2 or 3, in which a layer of sealant material is co-<br>
extruded on to each rib.<br>
5. A reclosable fastener substantially as hereinbefore described with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>
A reclosable fastener (10) comprising a male/female closure between a pair of opposed base<br>
members (18) has a single flange (16) for attachment of the closure to a web or film (34) on one only<br>
