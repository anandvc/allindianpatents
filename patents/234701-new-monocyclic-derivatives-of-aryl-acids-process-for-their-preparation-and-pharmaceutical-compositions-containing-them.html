Background Of Invention<br>
Atherosclerosis and other peripheral vascular diseases effect the quality of life of millions of people. Therefore, considerable attention has been directed towards understanding the etiology of hypercholesterolemia and hyperlipidemia and the development of effective therapeutic strategies.<br>
Hypercholesterolemia has been defined as plasma cholesterol level that exceeds arbitrarily defined value called "normal" level. Recently, it has been accepted that "ideal" plasma levels of cholesterol are much below the "normal" level of cholesterol in the general population and the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) increases as cholesterol level rises above the "optimum" (or "ideal") value. There is clearly a definite cause and effect-relationship between hypercholesterolemia and CAD, particularly for individuals with multiple risk factors. Most of the cholesterol is present in the esterified forms with various lipoproteins such as low density lipoprotein (LDL), intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), high density lipoprotein (HDL) and partially as very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). Studies clearly indicate that there is an inverse correlationship between CAD and atherosclerosis with serum HDL-cholesterol concentrations. (Stampfer et ai, N. Engl. J. Med., 325 (1991), 373-381) and the risk of CAD increases with increasing levels of LDL and VLDL.<br>
In CAD, generally "fatty streaks" in carotid, coronary and cerebral arteries, are found which are primarily free and esterified cholesterol. Miller et al, {Br. Med. J., 282 (1981), 1741-1744) have shown that increase in HDL-particles may decrease the number of sites of stenosis in coronary arteries of humans, and high level of HDL-cholesterol may protect against the progression of atherosclerosis. Picardo et al, {Arteriosclerosis 6 (1986) 434 - 441) have shown by in vitro experiments that HDL is capable of removing cholesterol from cells. They suggest that HDL may deplete tissues of excess free cholesterol and transfer them to the liver (Macikinnon et al, J. Biol Chem. 261 (1986), 2548-2552). Therefore, agents that increase HDL cholesterol would have therapeutic significance for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and coronary heart diseases (CHD).<br>
Obesity is a disease highly prevalent in affluent societies and in the developing world and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. It is a state of excess body fat accumulation. The causes of obesity are unclear. It is believed to be of genetic origin or promoted by an interaction between the genotype and environment. Irrespective of the cause, the result is fat deposition due to imbalance between the energy intake versus energy<br><br>
expenditure. Dieting, exercise and appetite suppression have been a part of obesity treatment. There is a need for efficient therapy to fight this disease since it may lead to coronary heart disease, diabetes, stroke, hyperlipidemia, gout, osteoarthritis, reduced fertility and many other psychological and social problems.<br>
Diabetes and insulin resistance is yet another disease which severely effects the quality of life of a large population in the world. Insulin resistance is the diminished ability of insulin to exert its biological action across a broad range of concentrations. In insulin resistance, the body secretes abnormally high amounts of insulin to compensate for this defect; failing which, the plasma glucose concentration inevitably rises and develops into diabetes. Among the developed countries, diabetes mellitus is a common problem and is associated with a variety of abnormalities including obesity, hypertension, hyperiipidemia (J. Clin. Invest, (1985) 75:809-817; N. Engl. J. Med. (1987) 317:350-357; J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab., (1988) 66 : 580 - 583; J. Clin. Invest., (1975) 68:957-969) and other renal complications (See Patent Application No. WO 95/21608). It is now increasingly being recognized that insulin resistance and relative hyperinsulinemia have a contributory role in obesity, hypertension, atherosclerosis and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The association of insulin resistance with obesity, hypertension and angina has been described as a syndrome having insulin resistance as the central pathogenic link-Syndrome-X.<br>
Hyperiipidemia is the primary cause of cardiovascular (CVD) and other peripheral vascular diseases. High risk of CVD is related to the higher LDL (Low Density Lipoprotein) and VLDL (Very Low Density Lipoprotein) seen in hyper-lipidemia. Patients having glucose intolerance/insulin resistance in addition to hyperiipidemia have higher risk of CVD. Numerous studies in the past have shown that lowering of plasma triglycerides and total cholesterol, in particular LDL and VLDL and increasing HDL cholesterol help in preventing cardiovascular diseases.<br>
Peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPAR) are members of the nuclear receptor super family. The gamma (y) isoform of PPAR (PPARy) has been implicated in regulating differentiation of adipocytes (Endocrinology, (1994) 135: 798-800) and energy homeostasis (Cell, (1995) 83: 803-812), whereas the alpha (a) isoform of PPAR (PPARa) mediates fatty acid oxidation (Trend. Endocrin. Metab., (1993) 4: 291-296) thereby resulting in reduction of circulating free fatty acid in plasma (Current Biol. (1995) 5:618-621). PPARa agonists have been found usefiil for the treatment of obesity (WO 97/36579). It has been recently disclosed that the hypolipidaemic effect is enhanced when the molecule<br><br>
I<br>
has both PPARa and PPARy agonist activity and suggested to be useful for the treatment of syndrome X (WO 97/25042). Synergism between the insulin sensitizer (PPARy agonist) and HMG CoA reductase inhibitor has been observed which may be useful for the treatment of atherosclerosis and xanthoma. (EP 0 753 298).<br>
It is known that PPARy plays an important role in adipocyte differentiation (Cell, (1996) 87, 377-389). Ligand activation of PPAR is sufficient to cause complete terminal differentiation (Cell, (1994) 79, 1147-1156) including cell cycle withdrawal. PPARy is consistently expressed in certain cells and activation of this nuclear receptor with PPARy agonists would stimulate the terminal differentiation of adipocyte precursors and cause morphological and molecular changes characteristics of a more differentiated, less maUgnant state (Molecular Cell, (1998), 465-470; Carcinogenesis, (1998), 1949-53; Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., (1997) 94, 237-241) and inhibition of expression of prostate cancer tissue (Cancer Research (1998), 58:3344-3352). This would be useful in the treatment of certain types of cancer, which express PPARy and could lead to a quite nontoxic chemotherapy.<br>
Leptin resistance is a condition wherein the target cells are unable to respond to leptin signals. This may give rise to obesity due to excess food intake and reduced energy expenditure and cause impaired glucose tolerance, type 2 diabetes, cardio-vascular diseases and such other interrelated complications. Kallen et al (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., (1996) 93, 5793-5796) have reported that insulin sensitizers which perhaps due to their PPAR agonist expression and lower plasma leptin concentrations. However, it has been recently disclosed that compounds having insulin sensitizing property also possess leptin sensitization activity. They lower die circulating plasma leptin concentrations by improving the target cell response to leptin (WO 98/02159).<br>

The   compounds   of the  present  invention   lower  random  blood   sugar  level, triglyceride, total cholesterol, LDL, VLDL and increased HDL. This was demonstrated by in vitro as well as in vivo animal experiments. Demonstration of Efficacy of Compounds : A)       In vitro:<br>
a)	Determination of hPPARa activity :<br>
Ligand binding domain of hPPARa was fused to DNA binding domain of Yeast transcription factor GAL4 in eucaryotic expression vector. Using superfect (Qiagen, Germany) as transfecting reagent HEK-293 cells were transfected with this plasmid and a reporter plasmid harboring the luciferase gene driven by a GAL4 specific promoter. Compound was added at different concentrations after 42 hrs of transfection and incubated overnight. Luciferase activity as a function of compound binding/activation capacity of PPARa was measured using Packard Luclite kit (Packard, USA) in Top Count (Ivan Sadowski, Brendan Bell, Peter Broag and Melvyn HoUis. Gene. 1992. 118 : 137 -141; Superfect Transfection Reagent Handbook. February 1997. Qiagen, Germany).<br>
b)	Determination of hPPARy activity:<br>
Ligand binding domain of hPPARyl was fused to DNA binding domain of Yeast transcription factor GAL4 in eucaryotic expression vector. Using lipofectamine (Gibco BRL, USA) as transfecting reagent HEK-293 cells were transfected with this plasmid and a reporter plasmid harboring the luciferase gene driven by a GAL4 specific promoter. Compound was added at 1 |j.M concentration after 48 hrs of transfection and incubated overnight. Luciferase activity as a fimction of drug binding/activation capacity of PPARyl was measured using Packard Luclite kit (Packard, USA) in Packard Top Count (Ivan Sadowski, Brendan Bell, Peter Broag and Melvyn Hollis. Gene. 1992. 118 : 137 -141;<br><br><br>
c)        Determination of HMG CoA reductase inhibition activity:<br>
Liver microsome bound reductase was prepared from 2% cholestyramine fed rats at mid-dark cycle. Spectrophotometric assays were carried out in 100 mM KH2PO4, 4 mM DTT, 0.2 mM NADPH, 0.3 mM HMG CoA and 125 |ag of liver microsomal enzyme. Total reaction mixture volume was kept as 1 ml. Reaction was started by addition of HMG CoA. Reaction mixture was incubated at 37 Â°C for 30 min and decrease in absorbance at 340 nm was recorded. Reaction mixture without substrate was used as blank (Goldstein, J. L and Brown, M. S. Progress in understanding the LDL receptor and HMG CoA reductase, two membrane proteins that regulate the plasma cholesterol. J. Lipid Res. 1984, 25: 1450 -1461). The test compounds inhibited the HMG CoA reductase enzyme. B) In vivo Efficacy in genetic models:<br>
Mutation in colonies of laboratory animals and different sensitivities to dietary regimens have made the development of animal models with non-insulin dependent diabetes and hyperlipidemia associated with obesity and insulin resistance possible. Genetic models such as db/db and ob/ob (Diabetes, (1982) 31(1): 1-6) mice and zucker fa/fa rats have been developed by the various laboratories for understanding the pathophysiology of disease and testing the efficacy of new antidiabetic compounds (Diabetes, (1983) 32: 830-838 ; Annu. Rep. Sankyo Res. Lab. (1994). 46 : 1-57). The homozygous animals, C57 BL/KsJ-db/db mice developed by Jackson Laboratory, US, are obese, hyperglycemic, hyperinsulinemic and insulin resistant (J. Clin. Invest., (1990) 85 : 962-967), whereas heterozygous are lean and normoglycemic. In db/db model, mouse progressively develops insulinopenia with age,<br><br>
a feature commonly observed in late stages of human type II diabetes when blood sugar levels are insufficiently controlled.   The state of pancreas and its course vary according to the models.  Since this model resembles that of type II diabetes mellitus, the compounds of the present invention were tested for blood sugar and triglycerides lowering activities. Male C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice of 8 to 14 weeks age, having body weight range of 35 to 60 grams, bred at Dr. Reddy's Research Foundation (DRF) animal house, were used in the experiment.   The mice were provided with standard feed (National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), Hyderabad, India) and acidified water, ad libitum.   The animals having more than 350 mg/dtblood sugar were used for testing. Thenumber of animals in each group was4. Test compounds were suspended on 0.25 % carboxymethyl cellulose and administered to test group at a dose of 0.001 mg to 30 mg / kg through oral gavage daily for 6 days.  The control group received vehicle (dose 10 ml / kg). On 6th day the blood samples were collected one hour after administration of test compounds / vehicle for assessing the biological activity.<br>
The random blood sugar and triglyceride levels were measured by collecting blood (100 1^1) through orbital sinus, using heparinised capillary in tubes containing EDTA which was centrifuged to obtain plasma. The plasma glucose, and triglyceride levels were measured spectrometrically, by glucose oxidase and glycerol-3-P04 oxidase/peroxidase enzyme (Dr. Reddy's Lab. Diagnostic Division Kits, Hyderabad, India) methods respectively.<br>
The blood sugar and triglycerides lowering activities of the test compound was calculated according to the formula. No adverse effects were observed for any of the mentioned compounds of invention in the<br><br>
The ob/ob mice are obtained at 5 weeks of age from Bomholtgard, Denmark and were used at 8 weeks of age. Zucker fa/fa fatty rats are obtained from IffaCredo, France at 10 weeks of age and were used at 13 weeks of age. The animals are maintained under 12<br><br>
hour light and dark cycle at 25 + 1 Â°C. Animals are given standard laboratory chow (NIN, Hyderabad, India) and water, ad libitum (Fujiwara, T.,. Yoshioka. S., Yoshioka, T.. Ushiyama, I and Horikoshi, H. Characterization of new oral antidiabetic agent CS-045. Studies in KK and ob/ob mice and Zucker fatty rats. Diabetes. 1988, 37 : 1549 - 1558). The test compounds are to be administered at 0.1 to 30 mg/kg/day dose for 9 days. The control animals received the vehicle (0.25 % carboxymethylcellulose, dose 10 ml/kg) through oral gavage.<br>
The blood is to be collected in fed state 1 hour after drug administration on 0 and 9 day of treatment. The blood is collected from the retro-orbital sinus through heparinised capillary in EDTA containing tubes. After centrifiigation, plasma sample is separated for triglyceride, glucose, free fatty acid, total cholesterol and insulin estimations. Measurement of plasma triglyceride, glucose, total cholesterol will be done using commercial kits (Dr. Reddy's Laboratory, Diagnostic Division kits, Hyderabad, India). The plasma free fatty acid will be measured using a commercial kit form Boehringer Mannheim, Germany. The plasma insulin will be measured using a RIA kit (BARC, India). The reduction of various parameters examined are calculated according to the formula given below.<br>
In ob/ob mice oral glucose tolerance test is performed after 9 days treatment. Mice are fasted for 5 hrs and challenged with 3 gm/kg of glucose orally. The blood samples are collected at 0, 15, 30, 60 and 120 min for estimation of plasma glucose levels. The experimental results suggest that the compounds of the present invention also possess therapeutic utility as a prophylactic or regular treatment for diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disorders such as hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and other diseases; as it is known from the literature that such diseases are interrelated to each other.<br>
Blood glucose level and triglycerides are also lowered at doses greater than 10 mg/kg.<br>
Normally, the quantum of reduction is dose dependent and plateaus at certain dose.<br>
b)	Cholesterol lowering activity in hypercholesterolemic rat models:<br>
Male Sprague Dawley rats (NIN stock) are bred in DRF animal house. Animals are maintained under 12 hour light and dark cycle at 25 Â± 1 "C. Rats of 180 - 200 gram body weight range are used for the experiment. Animals are made hypercholesterolemic by feeding 2% cholesterol and 1% sodium chelate mixed with standard laboratory chow [National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), Hyderabad, India] for 6 days. Throughout the experimental period the animals were maintained on the same diet (Petit, D., Bonnefis, M.<br><br>
T., Rey, C and Infante, R. Effects of ciprofibrate on liver lipids and lipoprotein synthesis in<br>
normo- and hyperlipidemic rats. Atherosclerosis, 1988. 74 : 215 - 225).<br>
The test compounds are administered orally at a dose 0.1 to 30 mg/kg/day for 3 days.<br>
Control group is treated with vehicle alone (0.25 % Carboxymethylcellulose; dose 10<br>
ml/kg).<br>
The blood samples are collected in fed state 1 hour after drug administration on 0<br>
and 3 day of compound treatment. The blood was collected from the retro-orbital sinus<br>
through heparinised capillary in EDTA containing tubes. After centrifugation, plasma<br>
sample is separated for total cholesterol, HDL and triglyceride estimations. Measurgment of<br>
plasma triglyceride, total cholesterol and HDL is done using commercial kits (Dr. Reddy's<br>
Laboratory, Diagnostic Division, India). LDL and VLDL cholesterol is calculated from the<br>
data obtained for total cholesterol, HDL and triglyceride. The reduction of various<br>
parameters examined is calculated according to the formula given below.<br>
c)	Plasma triglyceride and total cholesterol lowering activity in Swiss albino mice<br>
and Guinea pigs:<br>
Male Swiss albino mice (SAM) and male Guinea pigs were obtained from NIN and housed in DRF animal house. All these animals were rR2aintained under 12 hour light and dark cycle at 25 Â± l^C. Animals were given standard laboratory chow (NIN, Hyderabad, India) and water, ad libitum. SAM of 20 - 25 g body weight range and Guinea pigs of 500 - 700 g body weight range were used (Oliver, P., Plancke, M. O., Marzin, D., Clavey, V., Sauzieres, J and Fruchart, J. C. Effects of fenofibrate, gemfibrozil and nicotinic acid on plasma lipoprotein levels in normal and hyperlipidemic mice. Atherosclerosis, 1988. 70 : 107 - 114).<br>
The test compounds were administered orally to Swiss albino mice at 0.3 to 30 mg/kg/day dose for 6 days. Control mice were treated with vehicle (0.25% Carboxymethylcellulose; dose 10 ml/kg). The test compounds were administered orally to Guinea pigs at 0.3 to 30 mg/kg/day dose for 6 days. Control animals were treated with vehicle (0.25% Carboxymethylcellulose; dose 5 ml/kg).<br>
The blood samples were collected in fed state 1 hour after drug administration on 0 and 6 day of treatment. The blood was collected from the retro-orbital sinus through heparinised capillary in EDTA containing tubes. After centrifugation, plasma sample was separated for triglyceride and total cholesterol (Wieland, O. Methods of Enzymatic analysis. Bergermeyer, H. O., Ed., 1963. 211 - 214; Trinder, P. Ann. Clin. Biochem. 1969. 6 ; 24 -<br><br>
