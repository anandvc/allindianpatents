RELATED -APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No.<br>
60/628.P79, filed November 18, 2004; U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/709,358.<br>
filed August 18, 2005, and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/725,044, filed<br>
October* 6, 2005. The entire teachings of the above applications are incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Although tremendous advances have been made in elucidating the genomic<br>
abnormalities that cause malignant cancer ce'ls, currently available chemotherapy<br>
remains -unsatisfactory, and the prognosis for the majority of patients diagnosed with<br>
cancer remains dismal. Most chemotherapeutic agents act on a specific molecular<br>
target thought to be involved in the development of the malignant phenotype.<br>
However, a complex network of signaling pathways regulate cell proliferation, and<br>
the majqrity of malignant cancers are facilitated by multiple genetic abnormalities in<br>
these pathway. Therefore, it is unlikely that a therapeutic agent that acts on one<br>
molecular target will be fully effective in curing a patient who has cancer.<br>
Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are a class of chaperone proteins that are upregulatecl<br>
in response :o elevated temperature and other environmental stresses, such<br>
as ultraviolet light, nutrient deprivation, and oxygen deprivation. HSPs act as<br>
chaperones to other cellular proteins (called client proteins) and facilitate their<br>
proper folding and repair, and aid in the refolding of misfolded client proteins.<br>
There art several known families of HSPs, each having its own set of client proteins.<br>
The Hsp90 family is one of the most abundant HSP families, accounting for about 1-<br>
2% of proteins in a cell that is not under stress and increasing to about 4-6% in a ceil<br>
under strjess. Inhibition of Hsp90 results in degradation of its client proteins via the<br>
ubiquitin proteasome pathway. Unlike other chaperone proteins, the client proteins<br>
of Hsp9Q are mostly protein kinases or transcription factors involved in signal<br>
transduction, and a number of its client proteins have been shown to be involved in<br>
the progression of cancer. Examples of Hsp90 client proteins that have been<br>
implicated in the progression of cancer are described below.<br>
Her-2 is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase cell surface growth factor receptor<br>
that is expressed in normal epithelial cells. Her2 has an extracellular domain that<br>
interacts with extracellular growth factors and an internal tyrosine kinase portion<br>
that transmits the external growth signal to the nucleus of the cell. Her2 is<br>
overexpressed in a significant proportion of malignancies, such as breast cancer,<br>
ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, and gastric cancers, and is typically associated with<br>
a poor prognosis.<br>
c-Kit is a membrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase which binds Stem Cell<br>
Factor (SCF) to its extraellular domain. c-Kit is involved in the development of<br>
melanocytes, mast, germ and hematopoietic cells, and there is evidence that it plays<br>
a role in several types of cancer including leukemias, mast cell tumors, small cell<br>
lung cancer, testicular cancer, cancers of the gastointesinal tract and cancers of the<br>
central nervous system.<br>
c-Met is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is encoded by the Met protooncogene<br>
and transduces the biological effects of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which is<br>
also referred to as scatter factor (SF). Jiang et al., Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hemtol. 29: 209-<br>
248 (1999), the entire teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference, c-<br>
Met and HGF are expressed in numerous tissues, although their expression is<br>
normally confined predominantly to cells of epithelial and mesenchymal origin,<br>
respectively. c-Met and HGF are required for normal mammalian development and<br>
have been shown to be important in cell migration, cell proliferation and survival,<br>
morphogenic differentiation, and organization of 3-dimensional tubular structures<br>
(e.g., renal tubular cells, gland formation, etc.). The c-Met receptor has been shown<br>
to be expressed in a number of human cancers. c-Met and its ligand, HGF, have also<br>
been shown to be co-expressed at elevated levels in a variety of human cancers<br>
(particularly sarcomas). However, because the receptor and ligand are usually<br>
expressed by different cell types, c-Met signaling is most commonly regulated by<br>
tumor-stroma (tumor-host) interactions. Furthermore, c-Met gene amplification,<br>
mutation, and rearrangement have been observed in a subset of human cancers.<br>
Famiiies with germine mutations that actuate c-Mct kinase are prone to multiple<br>
kidney tumors as \vell as tumors in other tissues. Numerous studies have correlated<br>
the expression of c-Met and/or HGF/SF with the state of disease progression of<br>
different types of cancer (including lung, colon, breast, prostate, liver, pancreas,<br>
brain, kidney, ovaries, stomach, skin, and bone cancers). Furthermore, the<br>
overexpression of c-Met or HGF have been shown to correlate with poor prognosis<br>
and disease outcome in a number of major human cancers including lung, liver.<br>
gastric, and breast.<br>
Akt kinase is a serine/threonine kinase which is a downstream effector<br>
molecule of phosphoinositide 3-kinase and is involved in protecting the cell from<br>
apoptosis. Akt kinase is thought to be involved in the progression of cancer because<br>
it stimulates cell proliferation and suppresses apoptosis.<br>
Cdk4/cyclin D complexes are involved in phosphorylation of retinoblastcma<br>
protein which is an essential step in progression of a cell through the Gl phase of the<br>
cell cycle. Disruption of Hsp90 activity has been shown to decrease the half life of<br>
newly synthesized Cdk4.<br>
Raf-1 is a MAP 3-kinase (MAP3K) which when activated can phosphor- late<br>
and acitivate the serine/threonine specific protein kinases ERK1 and ERK2.<br>
Activated ERKs play an important role in the control of gene expression involved in<br>
the cell division cycle, apoptosis, cell differentiation and cell migration.<br>
The transforming protein of Rous sarcoma virus,v-src, is a prototype of an<br>
oncogene family that induces cellular transformation (i.e., tumorogenesis) by nonregulated<br>
kinase activity. Hsp90 has been shown to complex with v-scr and inhibit<br>
its degradation.<br>
The BCR-ABL fusion protein associated with chronic myelogenous<br>
leukemia and in a subset of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The fusion<br>
protein is a consequence of exchange of genetic material from the long arms of<br>
chromosomes 9 and 22 and results in unregulated tyrosine kinase activity. BCRABL<br>
exists as a complex with Hsp90 and is rapidly degraded when the action of<br>
Hsp90 is inhibited.<br>
Hsp90 is required to maintain steroid hormone receptors in a conformation<br>
capable of binding hormone with high affinity. Inhibition ofthe action of HspPO<br>
therefore is expected to be useful in treating hormone-associated malignancies such<br>
as breast cancer.<br>
:p53 is a tumor suppressor protein that causes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.<br>
Mutation of the p53 gene is found in about half of all human cancers making it one<br>
of the most common genetic alterations found in cancerous cells. In addition. p53<br>
mutation is associated with a poor prognosis. Wild-type p53 has been shown to<br>
interact with Hsp90, but mutated p53 forms a more stable association than wild-type<br>
p53 as a result of its misfolded conformations. A stronger interaction with Hsp90<br>
protects the mutated protein form normal proteolytic degradation and prolongs its<br>
half-life. In a cell that is heterozygous for mutated and wild-type p53, inhibition of<br>
the stabilizing effect of Hsp90 causes mutant p53 to be degraded and restores the<br>
normal rranscriptional activity of wild-type p53.<br>
Hif-la is a hypoxia-inducible transcription factor thai is up-regulated under<br>
low oxygen conditions. Under normal oxygen conditions Hif-la associates with<br>
Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein and is degraded. Low oxygen<br>
conditions inhibits this association and allows Hif-la to accumulate and complex<br>
with Hif-lp to form an active transcription complex that associates with hypo.viarespon$<br>
e elements to activate the transcription of vascular endothelial growth factor<br>
(VEGF). Increased Hif-la is associated with increased metastasis and a poor<br>
prognosis.<br>
Hsp90 has been shown by mutational analysis to be necessary for the<br>
survival of normal eukaryotic cells. However. Hsp90 is over expressed in many<br>
tumor types indicating that it may play a significant role in the survival of cancer<br>
cells and that cancer cells may be more sensitive to inhibition of Hsp90 than normal<br>
cells. For example, cancer cells typically have a large number of mutated and<br>
overexpressed oncoproteins that are dependent on Hsp90 for folding. In addition,<br>
because the environment of a tumor is typically hostile due to hypoxia, nutrient<br>
deprivation, acidosis, etc., tumor cells may be especially dependent on Hsp90 for<br>
survival. Moreover, inhibition of Hsp90 causes simultaneous inhibition of a number<br>
of oncoproteins. as well as hormone receptors and transcription factors making it an<br>
attractive target for an anti-cancer agent. In fact, benzoquinone ansamycins, a<br>
family of natural products that inhibit Hsp90. has shown evidence of therapeutic<br>
activity in clinical trials.<br>
Although promising, bcnzoquinone ansamycins, and their derivatives, suffer<br>
from a number of limitations. For example, they have low oral bioavailabiliry. and<br>
their limited solubility makes them difficult to formula. In addition, they are<br>
metabolized by polymorphic cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 and are a substrate for Pglycoprotein<br>
export pump involved in the development of multidrug resistance.<br>
Therefore, a need exist for new therapeutics that improve the prognosis of cancer<br>
patients and that rccuces or overcomes the limitations of currently used anti-cancer<br>
agents.<br>

Compounds of formula (IX) inhibit the activity of Hsp90 and are particularly<br>

The compounds shown in Table I or compounds of any formula herein, or<br>
tautomers. pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, clathrates, hydrates,<br>
polymorphs or prodrugs thereof, inhibit the activity of Hsp90 and, thereby facilitates<br>
the degradation of Hsp90 client proteins. Hsp90 is necessary for the survival of<br>
normal eukaryotic cells. However, Hsp90 is over expressed in many tumor types<br>
indicating that it may play a significant role in the survival of cancer cells and that<br>
cancer cells may be more sensitive to inhibition of Hsp90 than normal cells. Thus,<br>
the compounds shewn in Table I or compounds of any formula herein, or tautomers,<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, clathrates, hydrates, polymorphs or<br>
prodrugs thereof, are useful Treating proliferative disorders such as cancer.<br>
Although chemotherapeutic agents initially cause tumor regression, most<br>
agents that are currently used to treat cancer target only one pathway to tumor<br>
progression. Therefore, in many instances, after treatment with one or more<br>
chemotherapeutic agents, a tumor develops muhidrug resistance and no longer<br>
responses positively to treatment. One of the advantages of inhibiting Hsp90<br>
activity is that several of its client proteins, which are mostly protein kinases or<br>
transcription factors involved in signal transduction, have been shown to be involved<br>
in the progression of cancer. Thus, inhibition of Hsp90 provides a method of short<br>
circuiting several pathways for tumor progression simultaneously. Therefore,<br>
treatment of tumors with an Hsp90 inhibitor of the invention either alone, or in<br>
combination with other chemotherapeutic agents, is more likely to result in<br>
regression or elimination of the tumor, and less likely to result in the development of<br>
more aggressive multidrug resistant tumors than other currently available therapeis.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The foregoing and other objects, features and advantages of the invention<br>
will be apparent from the following more particular description of preferred<br>
embodiments of the invention, as illustrated in the accompanying drawings in which<br>
like reference characters refer to the same parts throughout the different views. The<br>
drawings are not necessarily to scale, emphasis instead being placed upon<br>
illustrating the principles of the invention.<br>
Figure 1 is a graph showing the ATPase activity of Hsp90 when untreated,<br>
when treated with 40 mM of Geldanamycin, a known Hsp90 inhibitor as a positive<br>
control, and when treated with 40(iM or 4(iM of Compound 108 of the invention;<br>
Figure 2 is gel showing the amount of Her2, an Hsp90 client protein, in cells<br>
that are untreated, in cells that have been treated with O.S^M, 2uM, or 5\iM of<br>
17AAG, a known Hsp90 inhibitor, and in cells that have been treated with 0.5(aM,<br>
2^M, or 5jj.M of Compound 108 or Compound 49;<br>
Figure 3 is a graph showing an FACSCalibur flow cytometer analysis of the<br>
c-kit positive population of HEL92.1.7 cells treated with Hsp90 inhibitors of the<br>
invention or 17AAG (as a positive control). The results indicate that the Hsp90<br>
inhibitors of the invention induce c-kit degradation at a lower concentration than<br>
17AAQ, an Hsp90 inhibitor that is currently in phase II clinical trials.<br>
Figure<br>
4 is a graph showing an FACSOiibur flow cytometer analysis of the<br>
c-kit posirive population of Kasumi-1 cells treated with Hsp90 inhibitors of the<br>
invention or 17AAG (as a positive control). The results indicate that the Hsp90<br>
inhibitors of the invention induce c-kit degradation at a lower concentration than<br>
17AAG, an Hsp90 inhibitor that is currently in phase II clinical trials<br>
Figure 5 is a Western blot analysis of the c-kit from Kasumi-1 cells' treated<br>
with Hsp90 inhibitors of the invention or 17AAG (as a positive control).<br>
Figure 6 is a Western blot analysis of the c-met from NCI-HI 193 cells<br>
treated with Hsp90 inhibitors of the invention or 17AAG (as a positive control).<br>
Figure 7 displays the results of a nude mouse xenograft study to determine<br>
the effect of Compound 49 on the in vivo growth rate of the human tumor cell line<br>
MDA-MB-435S. Tumor bearing animals (8 mice/group) were intraperitoneal (IP)<br>
injected 5 times per week for 3 weeks (hatched bar) and the average tumor volumes<br>
for each group (+/- SEM) were determined every 3-5 days. Treatment with a dose<br>
of 300 mg/kg body weight of Compound 49 decreased the growth rate of MDAMB-<br>
435S cells in nude mice to a greater extent than did a dose of 100 mg/kg body .<br>
weight of the Hsp90 inhibitor 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-<br>
AAG);<br>
Figure 8 demonstrates that treatment with Compound 49 did not cause<br>
toxicity in a nude mouse xenograft model using the human tumor cell line MDAMB-<br>
435S (tumor growth data from the same study is presented in Figure 3). Tumor<br>
bearing animals (8 mice/group) were intraperitoneal (EP) injected 5 times per week<br>
for 3 weeks (hatched bar) and the average percent changes in body weights for each<br>
group relative to the start of dosing were determined every 1-3 days (error bars not<br>
shown for clarity; mean coefficient of variation = 18%). Treatment with a dose of<br>
300 mg/kg body weight of Compound 49 was not toxic, as indicated by its lack of<br>
an effect on the body weights in animals treated with Compound 49 versus vehicle<br>
treated animals:<br>
Figure 9 displays the results of a nude mouse xenograft study to determine<br>
the effect of Compound 188 on the in vivo growth rate of RERF-LC-AIlVP human<br>
lung tymor cells. Tumor bearing animals (8 mice/group) were i.p. injected 5 times<br>
per week for a total of 15 doses (hatched bar) and the average tumor volumes for<br>
each group (error birs represent SEM) were determined every 3-4 days. Treatment<br>
with a dose of 200 mg/kg body weight of Compound 188 inhibited rumor growth, as<br>
did a dose of 75 mg"kg body weight of 17-AAG (both compounds were dosed at<br>
approximately their maximum to'erated doses in nude mice); and<br>
Figure 10 demonstrates that treatment with Compound 188 does not cause<br>
overt toxicity in a nude mouse xenograft model using RERF-LC-AI|VP human lung<br>
tumor cells (data derived from the same study presented in Figure 5). Tumor<br>
bearing animals (8 mice/group) were i.p. injected 5 times per week for a total of 15<br>
doses ('hatched ban and the cumulative average percent changes in body weights for<br>
each group relative to the start of dosing were determined every' 2-3 days.<br>
Treatment with a dose of 200 mg/kg body weight of Compound 188 was not overtly<br>
toxic, as indicated by the minimal effects on the animal body weights in the test<br>
article-treated versus vehicle-treated groups.<br>

invention, the chemical structures depicted herein, including the compounds of this<br>
invention, encompass all of the corresponding compounds' enantiomers,<br>
diastereomers and geometric isomers, that is, both the stereochemically pure form<br>

As used herein, the term "polymorph" means solid crystalline forms of a<br>
compound of the present invention or complex thereof. Different polymorphs of the<br>
same compound can exhibit different physical, chemical and/or spectroscopic<br>
properties. Different physical properties include, but are not limited to stability<br>
(e.g, to heat or light), compressibility and density (important in formulation and<br>
product manufacturing), and dissolution rates (which can affect bioavailability).<br>
Differences in stability can result from changes in chemical reactivity (e.g.,<br>
differential oxidation, such that a dosage form discolors more rapidly when<br>
comprised of one polymorph than when comprised of another polymorph) or<br>
mechanical characteristics (e.g., tablets crumble on storage as a kinetically favored<br>
polymorph converts to thermodynamically more stabie poiymorph) or both (e.g.,<br>
tablets of one polymorph are more susceptible to breakdown at high humidity).<br>
Different physical properties of polymorphs can affect their processing. For<br>
example, one polymorph might be more likely to form solvates or might be more<br>
difficult to filter or wash free of impurities than another due to, for example, the<br>
shape or size distribution of particles of it.<br>
As used herein, the term "hydrate" means a compound of the present<br>
invention or a salt thereof, that further includes a stoichiometric or nonstoichiometric<br>
amount of water bound by non-covalent intermolecular forces.<br>

Other examples of leukemias include acute and/or chronic leukemias, e.g..<br>
lymphocytic leukemia (e.g., as exemplified by the p388 (murine) cell line), large<br>
granular lymphoc&gt;tic leukemia, and lymphoblastic leukemia; T-cell leukemias, e.g.,<br>
T-cell leukemia (e.g., as exemplified by the CEM, Jurkat, and HSB-2 (acute), YAC-<br>
1 (murine) cell lines), T-lymphocytic leukemia, and T-Iymphoblastic leukemia; B<br>

Williams &amp; Williams (1992) and Section 36 of Holland Frie Cancer Medicine 5th<br>
Ed., Bast et al. Eds.. B.C. Decker Inc. (2000). The entire teachings of the preceding<br>
references are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In one embodiment, the disclosed method is believed to be particularly<br>
effective in treating subject with non-solid tumors such as multiple myeloma. In<br>
another embodiment, the disclosed method is believed to be particularly effective<br>
against T-leukemia (e.g., as exemplified by Jurkat and CEM cell lines); B-Ieukemia<br>
(e.g., as exemplified by the SB cell line); promyelocytes (e.g., as exemplified by the<br>
HL-60 cell line); uterine sarcoma (e.g., as exemplified by the MES-SA cell line);<br>
monocytic leukemia (e.g., as exemplified by the THP-1 (acute) cell line); and<br>
lymphoma (e.g., as exemplified by the U937 cell line).<br>
Some of the disclosed methods can be particularly effective at treating<br>
subjects whose cancer has become "multi-drug resistant". A cancer which initially<br>
responded to an anti-cancer drug becomes resistant to the anti-cancer drug when the<br>
anti-cancer drug is no longer effective in treating the subject with the cancer. For<br>
example, many tumors will initially respond to treatment with an anti-cancer drug by<br>
decreasing in size or even going into remission, only to develop resistance to the<br>
drug. Drug resistant rumors are characterized by a resumption of their growth<br>
and/or Reappearance after having seemingly gone into remission, despite the<br>
administration of increased dosages of the anti-cancer drug Cancers that have<br>
developed resistance to two or more anti-cancer drugs are said to be "multi-drug<br>
resistant". For example, it is common for cancers to become resistant to three or<br>
more anti-cancer agents, often five or more anti-cancer agents and at times ten or<br>
more anti-cancer agents.<br>
As used herein, the term "c-kit associated cancer" refers to a cancer which<br>
has aberrant expression and/or activation of c-kit. c-Kit associated cancers include<br>

been implicated in playing a role in carcinogenesis of the female genital tract (Inoue,<br>
et ai, 1994, Cancer Res., 54(\ 1):3049-3053), sarcomas of neuroectodermal origin<br>
(Ricottii et a/., 1998. Blood, 97:2397-2405), and Schwann cell neoplasia associated<br>
with neurofibromatosis (Ryan, et a!., 1994,7. AVuro. Res., 37:415-432).<br>

As used herein, the term "effective amount" refers to an amount of a<br>
compound of this invention which is sufficient to reduce or ameliorate the severity,<br>
duration, progression, or onset of a proliferative disorder, prevent the advancement<br>
of a proiliferative disorder, cause the regression of a proliferative, prevent the<br>
recurrence, development, onset or progression of a symptom associated with a<br>
proliferfrtive disorder, or enhance or improve the prophylactic or therapeutic<br>
effect(sj) of another therapy. The precise amount of compound administered to a<br>
subject (will depend on the mode of administration, the type and severity of the<br>
disease or condition and on the characteristics of the subject, such as general health,<br>
age, sex, body weight and tolerance to drugs. It will also depend on the degree,<br>
severity and type of cell proliferation, and the mode of administration. The skilled<br>
artisan will be able to determine appropriate dosages depending on these and other<br>
factors. When co-administered with other agents, e.g., when co-administered with<br>
an anti-cancer agent, an "effective amount" of the second agent will depend on the<br>
type of drug used. Suitable dosages are known for approved agents and can be<br>
adjusted by the skilled artisan according to the condition of the subject, the type of<br>
condition(s) being treated and the amount of a compound of the invention being<br>
used, in cases where no amount is expressly noted, an effective amount should be<br>
assumed.<br>
Non-limiting examples of an effective amount of a compound of the<br>
invention are provided herein below. In a specific embodiment, the invention<br>
provides a method of preventing, treating, managing, or ameliorating a proliferate<br>
disorder or one or more symptoms thereof, said methods comprising administering<br>
to a subject in need thereof a dose of at least 150 ug/kg, preferably at least 250<br>
ig/kg, it least 500 ug/kg, at least 1 mg/kg, at least 5 mg/kg, at least 10 mg/kg, at<br>

once evfcry 4 days, once every 5 days, once every 6 days, once every 7 days, once<br>
every 8 days, once every 10 days, once every tvvo weeks, once every three weeks, or<br>
once a month.<br>
The dosages of a chemotherapeutic agents other than compounds of the<br>
invention, which have been or are currently being used to prevent, treat, manage, or<br>
ameliorate a proliferative disorder, or one or more symptoms thereof, can be used in<br>
the combination therapies of the invention. Preferably, dosages lower than those<br>
which have been or are currently being used to prevent, treat, manage, or ameliorate<br>
a prolifejrative disorder, or one or more symptoms thereof, are used in the<br>
combination therapies of the invention. The recommended dosages of agents<br>
currently used for the prevention, treatment, management, or amelioration of a<br>
proliferative disorder, or one or more symptoms thereof, can obtained from any<br>
reference in the art including, but not limited to, Hardman et ai, eds., 1996,<br>

reference in its entirety.<br>
As used herein, the terms "treat", "treatment" and "treating" refer to the<br>
reduction or amelioration of the progression, severity and/or duration of a<br>
proliferalive disorder, or the amelioration of one or more symptoms (preferably, one<br>
or more discernible symptoms) of a proliferative disorder resulting from the<br>
administration of one or more therapies (e.g., one or more therapeutic agents such as<br>
a compound of the invention). In specific embodiments, the terms 'Treat",<br>
"treatment" and "treating" refer to the amelioration of at least one measurable<br>
physical parameter of a proliferate disorder, such as growth of a tumor, not<br>
necessarily discernible by the patient. In other embodiments the terms "treat",<br>
"treatment" and "Heating" refer to the inhibition of the progression of a proliferative<br>
disorder, either physically by, e.g., stabilization of a discernible symptom,<br>
physiolpgically by, e.g., stabilization of a physical parameter, or both. In other<br>
embodiments the terms "treat", "treatment" and "treating" refer to the reduction or<br>
stabilization of tumor size or cancerous cell count.<br>
As used herein, the terms "prevent", "prevention" and "preventing" refer to<br>
the redaction in the risk of acquiring or developing a given proliferative disorder, or<br>
the redaction or inhibition of the recurrence or a proliferative disorder. In one<br>
embodiment, a compound crthe invention is administered as a preventative measure<br>
to a patient, preferably a human, having a genetic predisposition to any of the<br>
disorders described herein.<br>
As used herein, the terms "therapeutic agent" and "therapeutic agents" refer<br>
to any agent(s) which can be used in the treatment, management, or amelioration of<br>
a proliferative disorder or one or more symptoms thereof. In certain embodiments,<br>
the term "therapeutic agent" refers to a compound of the invention. In certain other<br>
embodiments, the term "therapeutic agent" refers does not refer to a compound of<br>
the invention. Preferably, a therapeutic agent is an agent which is known to be<br>
useful for, or has been or is currently being used for the treatment, management,<br>
prevention, or amelioration a proliferative disorder or one or more symptoms<br>
thereof.<br>
As used herein, the term "synergistic" refers to a combination of a compound<br>
of the invention and another therapy (e.g., a prophylactic or therapeutic agent),<br>
which is more effective than the additive effects of the therapies. A synergistic<br>
effect of a combination of therapies (e.g., a combination of prophylactic or<br>
therapeutic agents) permits the use of lower dosages of one or more of the therapies<br>
and/or less frequent administration of said therapies to a subject with a proiiferative<br>
disorder. The ability to utilize lower dosages of a therapy (e.g., a prophylactic or<br>
therapeutic agerit! and/or to administer said therapy less frequently reduces the<br>
tnxicity associated with the administration of said therapy to a subject without<br>
reducing the efficacy of said therapy in the prevention, management or treatment of<br>
a prolifbrative disorder. In addition, a synergistic effect can result in improved<br>
efficacy of agents in the prevention, nanagement or treatment of a proliferative<br>
disorder. Finally, a synergistic effect of a combination of therapies (e.g., a<br>
combirption of prophylactic or therapeutic agents) may avoid or reduce adverse or<br>
unwanted side effects associated with the use of either therapy alone.<br>
As used herein, the phrase "side effects" encompasses unwanted and adverse<br>
effects pf a therapy (e.g., a prophylactic or therapeutic agent). Side effects are<br>
always unwanted, but unwanted effects are not necessarily adverse. An adverse<br>
effect from a therapy (e.g., prophylactic or therapeutic agent) might be harmful or<br>
uncomfortable or risky. Side effects include, but are not limited to fever, chills,<br>
lethargy, gastrointestinal toxicities (including gastric and intestinal ulcerations and<br>
erosions), nausea, vomiting, neurotoxicities, nephrotoxicities, renal toxicities<br>
(including such conditions as papillary necrosis and chronic interstitial nephritis),<br>
hepatic toxicities (including elevated serum liver enzyme levels), myelotoxicities<br>
(including leukopenia, myelosuppression, thrombocytopenia and anemia), dry<br>
mouth, metallic taste, prolongation of gestation, weakness, somnolence, pain<br>
(including muscle pain, bone pain and headache), hair loss, asthenia, dizziness,<br>
extra-pyramidal s&gt;mptoms, akathisia, cardiovascular disturbances and sexual<br>
dysfunction.<br>
As used herein, the term "in combination" refers to the use of more than one<br>
therapies (e.g., one or more prophylactic and/or therapeutic agents). The use of the<br>
term "in combination" does not restrict the order in which therapies (e.g.,<br>
prophylactic and/or therapeutic agents) are administered to a subject with a<br>
prolifeflative disorder. A first therapy (e.g., a prophylactic or therapeutic agent such<br>
as a compound of the invention) can be administered prior to (e.g., 5 minutes, 15<br>
minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24<br>
hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 96 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 5 weeks, 6<br>
weeks, 8 weeks, or 12 weeks before), concomitantly with, or subsequent to (e.g.. 5<br>
minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 12<br>
hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 96 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 5<br>
weeks, 6 weeks, 8 weeks, or 12 weeks after) the administration of a second therapy<br>
(e.g., a prophylactic or therapeutic agent such as an anti-cancer agent) to a subject<br>
with a proUferattve disorder, such as cancer.<br>
As used herein, the terms "therapies" and "therapy" can refer to any<br>
protoc©l(s)', method(s), and/or agent(s) that can be used in the prevention, treatment,<br>
management, or amelioration of a proliferative disorder or one or more symptoms<br>
thereof.<br>
A used herein, a "protocol" includes dosing schedules and dosing regimens.<br>
The protocols herein are methods of use and include prophylactic and therapeutic<br>
protocols.<br>
As used herein, the terms "manage," "managing," and "management" refer<br>
to the !j»eneficial effects that a subject derives from a therapy (e.g., a prophylactic or<br>
therapeutic agent), which does not result in a cure of the disease. In certain<br>
embodiments, a subject is administered one or more therapies (e.g., one or more<br>
prophylactic or therapeutic agents) to "manage" a disease so as to prevent the<br>
progression or worsening of the disease.<br>
As used herein, a composition that "substantially" comprises a compound<br>
means that the composition contains more than about 80% by weight, more<br>

C. Methods for Making Compounds of the Invention<br>
Compounds of the invention can be obtained via standard, well-kncwn<br>
synthetic methodology, see e.g., March, J. Advanced Organic Chemistry; Reactions<br>
Mechanisms, and Structure, 4th ed., 1992. In particular, compounds of the invention<br>
can bek&gt;btained by heating a hydrazide (A) with an isocyanate (Xu = 0),<br>
isothiocyanate, (Xu = S) or carbodiimide (Xu = NR?) (B) in an alcohol to form<br>
intermediate (C). Intermediate (C) can be cyclized to form a triazole core (D) by<br>
heating it in an aqueous solution which includes about 2 molar equivalents of NaOH<br>
(see Sqheme I below). Starting materials useful for preparing compounds of the<br>
invention and intermediates therefore, are commercially available or can be prepared<br>
from commercially available materials using known synthetic methods and reagents.<br>
For example, a hydra/ide can be prepared by reacting an ester (such as 2,4-<br>
dihydr0xybenzoic acid methyl ester) or acid chloride with hydrazine. Isocyanates<br>
and isoithiocyanates (X-4 is O or S, respecii- ely) can be formed in a number of ways<br>
from compounds that have a primary amine group. For example, a primary amine<br>
can be reacted with phosgene or thiophosgene to form an isocyanate or an<br>
isothiocyanate, respectively. Alternatively, a cyanate or thiocyanate ion can be<br>
reacted with an alkyl halide to form an alkyl isocyanate or an alkyl isothiocyanate.<br>
In addition, a isothiocyanate can be prepared by reacting a diazonium salt with a<br>
thiocyanate ion. Carbodiimides (Xu is NR?) can be prepared by dehydration of<br>
ureas uging a dehydration agent such as tosyl chloride in pyridine, POCb, PC1.
P:0s-pyridine. and PhsPB^-EtsN. Other methods of preparing isocyanates,<br>
thioisocyanates, and carbodiimides can be found in March, J. Advanced Organic<br>
Chemistry; Reactions Mechanisms, and Structure, 4th ed., 1992, the entire teachings<br>
of which are incorporated by reference.<br>
Compounds represented by formulas (IV) and (V) can be made in an<br>
analogyous fashion as compounds depicted in Scheme I.<br>
Reactive functional groups can be protected during one or more reaction<br>
step, then deprotected to restore the original functionality. Examples of suitable<br>
protecting groups for hydroxy! groups include benzyl, methoxymethyl, allyl,<br>
trimethylsilyl, tert-butyldimethylsilyl, acetate, and the like. Examples of suitable<br>
amine protecting groups include benzyloxycarbonyl, tert-butoxycarbonyl, tert-butyl,<br>
benzyl and fluorer.ylmethylqxy-carbonyl (Fmoc). Examples of suitable thiol<br>
protecting groups include benzyl, tert-butyl, acetyl, methoxymethyl and the like.<br>
Other suitable protecting groups are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art<br>
and include those found in T. W. Greene, Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis,<br>

(Figure Removed)<br>
An alternative method of preparing the compounds of the invention is shown<br>
in Scheme II. In tnis method, an aryl, heteroaryl, cycloalkyl, or alkyl amine<br>
compound (i) is stirred at about room temperature with a thiocarbonyl (ii) which has<br>
two leaving groups. LI and La, such as imidazole-l-yl groups, to form compound<br>
(iii). Typically, the thiocarbonyl compound is present in a slight molar excess of<br>
about 1.05 eq. to ibout 1.3 eq. compared with compound (i). Compound (iii) is then<br>
combined with a h&gt; drazide compound (iv) in a solvent and heated to about 50°C to<br>
about 100°C for about 0.5 to 5 hrs to form compound (v). Typically, compound (iii)<br>
and compound (i% can be present in about equal molar ratio or a slight excess of<br>
compound (iii), such as about 1.01 to about 1.1 molar eq. of compound (iii) compare<br>
to compound (iv). Compound (v) can then be cyclized to form a triazole compound<br>
of the invention (\:\ by suspending it in aqueous solution containing about 2 molar<br>
eq. of NaOH and heating the solution to about 75°C to about 110°C for about 0.5 hr<br>
to about 2 hrs. Typically, the NaOH solut:on containing compound (v) is degassed<br>
before heating by bubbling an inert gas, such as nitrogen or argon, through it.<br>

In one embodiment, ring A of the compounds of the invention is a 2,4-<br>
dihydr0xyphenyl group. In this embodiment, it is sometimes desirable to prepare a<br>
prodrug by protecting the 4-hydroxy group with a moiety that can be hydrolyzed in<br>
vivo. Protection of the 4-hydroxy group is expected to improve the circulating halflife<br>
of Compound compounds of the invention. In addition, it is desirable that a<br>
group added to the 4-hydroxy group increase the water solubility of the compounds<br>
of the invention. In one embodiment, 4-methyl-piperizine-l-carbamoyl group is<br>
used to protect the 4-hydroxy group (see Scheme III). In this embodiment, a<br>
compound of the invention, such as compound (E), is treated with about one moiar<br>
equivalents of 4-methyl-piperizine-l-carbonyl chloride (F) in the presence of a base<br>
to form compound (G) in which the 4-hydroxy group is protected. Alternatively, the<br>
metcapto group can be protected first by reacting compound (E) with about one<br>
molar equivalent of acyl chloride in the presence of a base to form intermediate (H).<br>
Intermediate (H) can them be reacted with about one molar equivalent of 4-meth&gt; 1-<br>
piperiziirie-l-carbonyS chloride (F) in the presence of a base, then the acetyl group<br>
can be removed by treatment with a mild acid to form compound (G).<br>

Another prodrug of compounds of the the invention can be formed by<br>
addition of a phosphate group to the 4-hydroxy group (Scheme IV). In this<br>
embodiment, a compound of the invention, such as compound (E), is treated with<br>
about one molar equivalent of diisopropyl phosphoramidous acid di-t-butyl ester in<br>
the presence of tetrazole to yield compound (J). The phosphorous group is then<br>
oxidized with m-CPBA to form a phosphoric acid di-t-butyl ester group of<br>
compound K. The :-butyl groups are then hydrolyzed with trifluoroacetic acid<br>
(TFA) to &gt; ield a phosphoric acid group or compound L.<br>

1. c-Kit Associated Cancers<br>
SCF binding to the c-kit protects hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells<br>
from apoptosis (Lee. et al., 1997, J. Immunol., 15S&gt;:3211-3219), thereby contributing<br>
to colony formation and hematopoiesis. Expression of c-kit is frequently observed<br>
in acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) and sometimes observed in acute lymphoc&gt;Tic<br>
leukemia (ALL) (for reviews, see Sperling, et a!., 1997, Haemal., 82:611-621;<br>
Escrihano, et u/.. 1998, Leuk. Lymph., 30:459-466). Although c-kit is expressed in<br>
the majority of AML cells, its expression does not appear to be prognostic of disease<br>
progression (Sperling, et a/, 1997, Haemal. 52:617-621). However, SCF protected<br>
AML cells from apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic agents (Hassan, et a/.,<br>
1996, Ada. Hem., 9.5:257-262). Therefore, degradation of c-kit caused by the<br>
inhibition of Hsp90 by the compounds of the invembn will enhance the efficacy of<br>
these agents and may induce apoptosis of AML cells.<br>
The clonal growth of ceils from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome<br>
(Sawada, et al., 1996, Blood, 88:319-327) or chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)<br>
(Sawai, et al., 1996, Exp. Hem., 2:116-122) was found to be significantly enhanced<br>
by SCF in combination with other cytokines. CML is characterized by expansion of<br>
Philadelphia chromosome positive cells of the marrow (Verfaillie, et al., 1998,<br>
Leuk., 12:136-138), which appears to primarily result from inhibition of apoptotic<br>
death (Jones, 1997, Curr. Opin. One., P:3-7). The product of the Philadelphia<br>
chromosome, p210.sup.BCR-ABL, has been reported to mediate inhibition of<br>
apoptosis (Bedi, et al., 1995, Blood, 86:\ 148-1158). Since p210.sup.BCR-ABL and<br>
the c-kit RTK both inhibit apoptosis and p62.sup.dok has been suggested as a<br>
substrate (Carpino, et al., 1997, Cell, 88:197-204), it is possible that clonal<br>
expansion mediated by th?se kirases occurs through a common signaling pathway.<br>
However, c-kit has also been reported to interact directly with p210.sup.BCR-ABL<br>
(Hallek, et al., 1996, Brit. JHaem., 94:5-16), which suggests that c-kit may have a<br>
more causative role in CML pathology. Therefore, degradation of c-kit caused by<br>
the inhibition of Hsp90 by the compounds of the invention will prove useful in the<br>
treatment of CML.<br>
Normal colorectal mucosa does not express c-kit (Bellone, et al., 1997, J.<br>
Cell Physiol., / 72:1 -11). However, c-kit is frequently expressed in colorectal<br>
carcinoma (Bellone. et al., 1997, J. Cell PhysioL, 172: 1-11), and autocrine loops of<br>
SCF and c-kit have been observed in several colon carcinoma cell lines (Toyota, et<br>
al., 1993, Turn. BioL. 14:295-302; Lahm, et al.. 1995, Cell Growth &amp; Differ.,<br>
6:\ 111-1118; Bellone. etal., 1997,J. Cell Physiol., 772:1-11). Furthermore,<br>
disruption of the auiocrine loop by the use of neutralizing antibodies (Lahm, et a/.,<br>
1995, Cell Growth 
significantly inhibits cell proliferation (Lahm, et al, 1995, Cell Growth &amp; Differ!..<br>
6:1111-1118; Bellone, etal., 1997,J. Cell Physiol., 172:1-] 1).<br>
SCF/c-kit autocrine loops have been observed in gastric carcinoma cell lines<br>
(Turner, et al., 1992. Blood, 50:374-381; Hassan, etal., 1998, Digest. Dis. Science,<br>
43:8-14), and constitutive c-kit activation also appears to be important for<br>
gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). GISTs are the most common mesenchyinal<br>
tumor qf the digestive system. More than 90% of GISTs express c-kit,, which is<br>
consistent with the putative origin of these tumor cells from interstitial cells of Cajal<br>
(ICCs)(Hirota, et al, 1998, Ccience, 27P:577-580). The c-kit expressed in GISTs<br>
from several different patients was observed to have mutations in the intracellular<br>
juxtamembrane domain leading to constitutive activation (Hirota, et al., 1998,<br>
Science 279:577-580). Therefore, degradation of c-kit caused by the inhibition of<br>
Hsp90 by the compounds of the invention will be an efficacious means for the<br>
treatment of these cancers.<br>
Male germ cell tumors have been histologically categorized into seminomas,<br>
which retain germ cell characteristics, and nonseminomas which can display<br>
characteristics of embryonal differentiation. Both seminomas and nonseminomas<br>
are thought to initiate from a preinvasive stage designated carcinoma in situ (CIS)<br>
(Murty, et al., 1998, Sem. Oncol., 25:133-144). Both c-kit and SCF have been<br>
reported to be essential for normal gonadal development during embryogenesis<br>
(Loveland, et al., 1997, J. Endocrinol., 753:337-344). Loss of either the receptor or<br>
the ligand resulted in animals devoid of germ cells. In postnatal testes, c-kit has<br>
been found to be expressed in Leydig cells and spermatogonia, while SCF was<br>
expressed in Sertoli cells (Loveland, et al., 1997, J. Endocrinol., 153:337-344).<br>
Testicular tumors develop from Leydig cells with high frequency in transgenic mice<br>
expressing human papilloma virus 16 (HPV16) E6 and E7 oncogenes (Kondoh. et<br>
al.. 1991, J. Virol.. 65:3335-3339; Kondoh, etal., 1994, J. Urol., 752:2151-2154).<br>
These tumors express both c-kit and SCF, and an autocrine loop may contribute to<br>
the turmorigenesis (Kondoh, et al., 1995, Oncogene, 70:341-347) associated with<br>
cellular loss of functional p53 and the retinoblastoma gene product by association<br>
with E6 and E7 (Dyson, et al., 1989, Science, 243:934-937; Werness, et al., 1990,<br>
Science, 248:76-79: Scheffher, et al., 1990, Cell, 63:1129-1136). Defective signaling<br>
mutants of SCF (Kondoh, etal, 1995, Oncogene, 70:341-347) ore-kit (Li, et al..<br>
1996, Cane. Res., 5(5:4343-4346) inhibited formation of testicular tumors in mice<br>
expressing FfPV 16 E6 and E7. Since c-kit kinase activation is pivotal to<br>
tumoriigenesis in these animals, the compounds of the invention which inhibit Hsp90<br>
and thereby cause the degradation of c-kit will be useful for preventing or treating<br>
testicular tumors associated with human papilloma virus.<br>
Expression of c-kit on germ cell tumors shows that the receptor is expressed<br>
by the majority of carcinomas in situ and seminomas, but c-kit is expressed in only a<br>
minority of nonseminomas (Strohmeyer, et al., 1991, Cane. Res., 57:1811-1816;<br>
Rajpertfde Meyts, et al., 1994, Int. J. Androl., 77:85-92; Izquierdo, et al., 1995, J.<br>
Pathol, 777:253-258; Strohmeyer, etal, 1995, J. Urol., 153:511-515; Bokenmeyer,<br>
et al., 1996, J. Cance. Res., Clin. Oncol, 722:301-306; Sandlow, et al., 1996, J.<br>
Androl. 77:403-408). Tnerefore, degradation of c-kit caused by the inhibition of<br>
Hsp90 by the compounds of the invention will be an efficacious means for the<br>
treatment of these cancers.<br>
SCF and c-kit are expressed throughout the central nervous system of<br>
developing rodents, and the pattern of expression suggests a role in growth,<br>
migration and differentiation of neuroectodermal cells. Expression of SCF and c-kit<br>
have also been reported in the adult brain (Hamel, et al., 1997, J. Neuro-Onc.,<br>
15:327-333). Expression of c-kit has also been observed in normal human brain<br>
tissue (Tada, et al. 1994, J. Neuro., 50:1063-1073). Glioblastoma and astrocytoma,<br>
which define the majority of intracrania! tumors, arise from neoplastic<br>
transformation of astrocytes (Levin, et al., 1997, Principles &amp; Practice of Oncology,<br>
2022-2082). Expression of c-kit has been observed in glioblastoma cell lines and<br>
tissues (Berdel, et al., 1992, Cane. Res., 52:3498-3502; Tada, et al., 1994, J. Neuro.,<br>
50:1063-1073; Stamilia, etal, 1995, Act. Neuropath., SP:158-165).<br>
The association of c-kit with astrocytoma pathology is less clear. Reports of<br>
expression of c-kit in normal astrocytes have been made (Natali, et al., 1992, Int. J.<br>
Cane., 12:197-201). (Tada, etal. (994, J. Neuro., 50:1063-1073), while others<br>
report it is not expressed (Kristt, et al., 1993, Neuro., 33:106-115). In the former<br>
case, high levels of c-ki: expression in high grade tumors were observed (Kristt, et<br>
al., 1993, Neuro., 53:106-115), whereas in the laker case researchers were unable to<br>
detect any expression in astrocytomas. In addition, contradictory reports of c-kit and<br>
SCF expression in neuroblastomas also exist. One study found that neuroblastoma<br>
cell lintis often express SCF, but rarely express c-kit. In primary tumors, c-kit was<br>
detected in about 8% of neuroblastomas, while SCF was found in 18% of tumors<br>
 (Beck,, et al., 1995. Blood, 5(5:3132-3138). In contrast, other studies (Cohen, et ;?/..,<br>
1994, Blood, 54:3465-3472) have reported that all 14 neuroblastoma cell lines<br>
examimed contained c-kit/SCF autocrine loops, and expression of both the receptor<br>
and ligand were observed in 45% of tumor samples examined. In two cell lines.<br>
anti-c*k5t antibodies inhibited cell proliferation, suggesting that the SCF/c-kit<br>
autocrine loop contributed to growth (Cohen, et al., 1994, Blood, 54:3465-3472).<br>
Therefore, degradation of c-kit caused by the inhibition of Hsp90 by the compounds<br>
of the invention vv ill be an efficacious means for treating some cancers of the central<br>
nervows system.<br>
2. Combination Therapies and Treatment of Refractory Cancers<br>
The invention also provides methods of preventing, treating, managing, or<br>
ameliorating a proiiferative disorder, such as cancer, or one or more symptoms<br>
thereof, r-iid methods comprising administering to a subject in need thereof one or<br>
more compounds of the invention and one or more other therapies (e.g., one or more<br>
prophylactic or therapeutic agents that are currently being used, have been used, are<br>
known to be useful or in development for use in the prevention, treatment or<br>
amelioration of a proiiferative disorder, such as cancer, or one or more symptoms<br>
associated with said proiiferative disorder).<br>
The proph&gt; lactic or therapeutic agents of the combination therapies of the<br>
invention can be administered sequentially or concurrently. In a specific<br>
embodiment, the combination therapies of the invention comprise one or more<br>
compounds and at least one other therapy (e.g., another prophylactic or therapeutic<br>
agent) which has the same mechanism of action as said compounds. In another<br>
specific embodiment, the combination therapies of the invention comprise one or<br>
more tjompounds of the invention and at least one other therapy (e.g., another<br>
prophylactic or therapeutic agent) which has a different mechanism of action than<br>
said compounds. In certain embodiments, the combination therapies of the present<br>
invention improve the prophylactic or therapeutic effect of one or more compounds<br>
of the invention b&gt; functioning together with the compounds to have an additive or<br>
synergistic effect. In certain embodiments, the combination therapies of the present<br>
invention reduce trie side effects associated with the therapies (e.g., prophylactic or<br>
therapeutic agents). In certain embodiments, the combination therapies of the<br>
present invention reduce the effective dosage of one or more of the therapies.<br>
The prophylactic or therapeutic agents of the combination therapies can be<br>
administered to a subject, preferably a human subject, in the same pharmaceutical<br>
composition. In alternative embodiments, the prophylactic or therape itic agents of<br>
the combination therapies can be administered concurrently to a subject in separate<br>
pharmaceutical compositions. The prophylactic or therapeutic agents may be<br>
administered to a subject by the same or different routes of administration.<br>
In a specific embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition comprising one or<br>
more compounds of the invention is administered to a subject, preferably a human,<br>
to prevent, treat, manage, or ameliorate a proliferative disorder, such as cancer, or<br>
one or more symptom thereof. In accordance with the invention, pharmaceutical<br>
compositions of the invention may also comprise one or more other agents (e.g.,<br>
prophylactic or therapeutic agents which are currently being used, have been used,<br>
or are known to be useful in the prevention, treatment or amelioration of a<br>
proliferative disorder or a symptom thereof)-<br>
The invention provides methods for preventing, managing, treating or<br>
ameliorating a proliferative disorder, such as cancer, or one or more symptoms<br>
thereof in a subject refractory (either completely or partially), to existing agent<br>
therapies for such a proliferative disorder, said methods comprising administering to<br>
said subject a dose of an effective amount of one or more compounds of the<br>
invention and a dose of an effective amount of one or more therapies (e.g., one or<br>
more prophylactic or therapeutic agents useful for the prevention, treatment,<br>
management, or amelioration of a proliferative disorder or a symptom thereof). The<br>
invention also provides methods for preventing, treating, managing, or ameliorating<br>
a proliferative disorder or a symptom thereof by administering one or more<br>
compounds of the invention in combination with any other therapy(ies) to patients<br>
who have proven refractory to other therapies but are no longeron these therapies.<br>
The compounds of the invention and/or other therapies can be administered<br>
to a subject by any route known to one of skill in the art. Examples of routes of<br>
administration include, but are not limited to, parenteral, e.g., intravenous,<br>
intraderrnal, subcutaneous, oral (?.g., inhalation), intranasal, transdermal (topical),<br>
transmucosal, and rectal administration.<br>
3. Agents Useful In Combination With the Compounds of the Invention<br>
Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the compounds of<br>
the invention can be particularly effective at treating subjects whose cancer has<br>
become multi-drug resistant. Although chemotherapeutic agents initially cause<br>
tumor regression, most agents that are currently used to treat cancer target only one<br>
pathway to tumor progression. Therefore, in many instances, after treatment with<br>
one or more chemotherapeutic agents, a tumor develops multidrug resistance and no<br>
longer response positively to treatment. One of the advantages of inhibiting Hsp90<br>
activity is that several of its client proteins, which are mostly protein kinases or<br>
transcription factors involved in signal transduction, have been shown to be involved<br>
in the progression of cancer. Thus, inhibition of Hsp90 provides a method of short<br>
circuiting several pathways for tumor progression simultaneously. Therefore, it is<br>
believed that treatment of cancer with an Hsp90 inhibitor of the invention either<br>
alone, or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents, is more likely to result<br>
in regression or elimination of the tumor, and less likely to result in the development<br>
of more aggressive multidrug resistant tumors than other currently available<br>
therapies.<br>
Anticancer agents that can be co-administered with the compounds of the<br>
invention include Taxol™, also referred to as "paclitaxel", is a well-known anticancer<br>
drug which acts by enhancing and stabilizing microtubule formation, and<br>
analogs of Taxol™, such as Taxotere™. Compounds that have the basic taxane<br>
skeleton as a common structure feature, have also been shown to have the ability' to<br>
arrest cells in the G2-M phases due to stabilization or inhibition of microtubules.<br>

E. Compositions and Methods for Administering Therapies<br>
The present invention provides compositions for the treatment, prophylaxis,<br>
and amelioration of proliferative disorders, such as cancer. In a specific<br>
embodiment, a composition comprises one or more compounds of the invention, or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, clathrate, hydrate or prodrug thereof. In<br>
another embodiment, a composition of the invention comprises one or more<br>
prophylactic or therapeutic agents other than a compound of the invention, or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, clathrate, hydrate, prodrug thereof. In<br>
another embodiment, a composition of the invention comprises one or more<br>
compounds of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, clathrate,<br>
hydrate or prodrug thereof, and one or more other prophylactic or therapeutic agents,<br>
la another embodiment, the composition comprises a compound of the invention, or<br>
a phartnareutiv^lly acceptable salt, solvate, clathrate, hydrate, or prodrug thereof,<br>
and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, a composition of the invention is a<br>
pharmaceutical composition or a single unit dosage form. Pharmaceutical<br>
compositions and dosage forms of the invention comprise one or more active<br>
ingredients in relative amounts and formulated in such a way that a given<br>
pharmaceutical composition or dosage form can be used to treaf or prevent<br>
prolifqrative disorders, such as cancer. Preferred pharmaceutical compositions and<br>
dosage forms comprise a compound of formula (I), (II), (III), (IV), (V), (VI), (VII),<br>
i VIII), (IX), (X), or Table 1, or a pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug, salt, solvate,<br>
clathrate, hydrate, or prodrug thereof, optionally in combination with one or more<br>
additional active agents.<br>
A pharmaceutical composition of the invention is formulated to be<br>
compatible with its intended route of administration. Examples of routes of<br>
administration include, but are not limited to, parenteral, e.g., intravenous,<br>
intradfcrmal. subcutaneous, oral (e.g., inhalation), intranasal, transdermal (topical),<br>
:ransmucosal, and recta! administration. In a specific embodiment, the composition<br>
is formulated in accordance with routine procedures as a pharmaceutical<br>
composition adapted for intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, oral, intranasal<br>
or topical administration to human beings. In a preferred embodinu . a<br>
pharmaceutical composition is formulated in accordance with routine procedures for<br>
subcutaneous administration to human beings.<br>
Single unit dosage forms of the invention are suitable for oral, mucosal (e.g.,<br>
nasal, sublingual, vagina , buccal, or rectal), parenteral (e.g., subcutaneous,<br>
intravenous, bolus injection, intramuscular, or intraarterial), or transdermal<br>
administration to a patient. Examples of dosage forms include, but are not limited<br>
to: tablets; caplets; capsules, such as soft elastic gelatin capsules; cachets; troches;<br>
lozenges; dispersions; suppositories; ointments; cataplasms (poultices); pastes;<br>
powdefs; dressings; creams; plasters; solutions; patches; aerosols (e.g., nasal sprays<br>
or inhalers); gels; liquid dosage forms suitable for oral or mucosal administration to<br>
a patieht, including suspensions (e.g., aqueous or non-aqueous liquid suspensions,<br>
oil-in-water emulsions, or a water-in-oil liquid emulsions), solutions, and elixirs:<br>
liquid dosage forms suitable for parenteral administration to a patient; and sterile<br>
solids (e.g., crystalline or amorphous solids) that can be reconstituted to provide<br>
liquid dosage forms suitable for parenteral administration to a patient.<br>
The composition, shape, and type of dosage forms of the invention will<br>
typically vary depending on their use. For example, a dosage form suitable for<br>
mucosal administration may contain a smaller amount of active ingredient(s) than an<br>
oral dosage form used to treat the same indication. This aspect of the invention will<br>
be realily apparent to those skilled in the art. See, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical<br>
Sciences (1990) 18th ed., Mack Publishing, Easton PA.<br>
Typical pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms comprise one or<br>
more gxcipients. Suitable excipients are well known to those skilled in the art of<br>
pharmacy, and non-limiting examples of suitable excipients art provided herein.<br>
Whether a particular excipient is suitable for incorporation into a pharmaceutical<br>
composition or dosage form depends on a variety of factors well known in the art<br>
including, but not limited to, the way in which the dosage form will be administered<br>
to a patient. For example, oral dosage forms such as tablets may contain excipients<br>
not suited for use in parenteral dosage forms.<br>
The suitability of a particular excipient may also depend on the specific<br>
active ingredients in the dosage form. For example, the decomposition of some<br>
active ingredients can be accelerated by some excipients such as lactose, or when<br>
exposed to water. Active ingredients that comprise primary or secondary amines<br>
(e.g., N-desmethylvenlafaxine and N,N-didesmethy!venlafaxine) are particularly<br>
susceptible to such accelerated decomposition. Consequently, this invention<br>
encompasses pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms that contain little, if<br>
any, lactose. As used herein, the term "lactose-free" means that the amount of<br>
lactose present, if any, is insufficient to substantially increase the degradation rate of<br>
an active ingredient. Lactose-free compositions of the invention can comprise<br>
excipients that are well known in the art and are listed, for example, in the U.S.<br>
Pharmocopia (TJSP) SP (XXJ)/NF (XVI). In general, lactose-free compositions<br>
comprise active ingredients, a binder/filler, and a lubricant in pharmaceutically<br>
compatible and pharmaceutically acceptable amounts. Preferred lactose-free dosage<br>
forms comprise active ingredients, microcrystalline cellulose, pre-gelatinized starch.<br>
and magnesium stearate.<br>
This invention further encompasses anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions<br>
and dosage forms comprising active ingredients, since water can facilitate the<br>
degrad&amp;tion of some compounds. For example, the addition of water (e.g., 5%) is<br>
widely accepted in the pharmaceutical arts as a means of simulating long-term<br>
storage in order to determine characteristics such as shelf-life or the stability of<br>
formulations over time. See, e.g., Jens T. Carstensen (1995) Drug Stability:<br>
Principles &amp; Practice. 2d. Ed., Marcel Dekker, NY, NY, 379-80. In effect, water<br>
and heat accelerate the decomposition of some compounds. Thus, the effect of<br>
water on a formulation can be of great significance since moisture and/or humidity<br>
are commonly encountered during manufacture, handling, packaging, storage,<br>
shipment, and use of formulations.<br>
Anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention<br>
can be prepared using anhydrous or low moisture containing ingredients and low<br>
moisture or low humidity conditions. Pharmaceutical compositions and dosage<br>
forms that comprise lactose and at least one active ingredient that comprises a<br>
primary or secondary amine are preferably anhydrous if substantial contact with<br>
moisture and/or humidity during manufacturing, packaging, and/or storage is<br>
expected.<br>
An anhydrous pharmaceutical composition should be prepared and stored<br>
such that its anhydrous nature is maintained. Accordingly, anhydrous compositions<br>
are preferably packaged using materials known to prevent exposure to water such<br>
that they can be included in suitable formulary kits. Examples of suitable packaging<br>
include, but are not limited to, hermetically sealed foils, plastics, unit dose<br>
containers (e.g., vials), blister packs, and strip packs.<br>
The invention further encompasses pharmaceutical compositions and dosage<br>
forms that comprise one or more compounds that reduce the rate by which an active<br>
ingredient will decompose. Such compounds, which are referred to herein as<br>
"stabilizer"' include, but are not limited to, antioxidants such as ascorbic acid, pH<br>

Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention that are suitable for oral<br>
administration can be presented as discrete dosage forms, such as, but are not limited<br>
to, tablets (e.g., chewable tablets), caplets, capsules, and liquids (e.g., flavored<br>
syrup$). Such dosage forms contain predetermined amounts of active ingredients,<br>
and may be prepared by methods of pharmacy well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
See generally. Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (1990) 18th ed., Mack<br>
Publishing, Easton PA.<br>
Typical oral dosage forms of the invention are prepared by combining the<br>
active ingredients) in an admixture with at least one excipient according to<br>
conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. Excipients can take a wide<br>
variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration.<br>
For example, excipients suitable for use in oral liquid or aerosol dosage forms<br>
include, but are not limited to, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents,<br>
preservatives, and coloring agents. Examples of excipients suitable for use in solid<br>
oral dosage forms (e.g., powders, tablets, capsules,, and caplets) include, but are not<br>
limited to, starches, sugars, micro-crystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents,<br>
lubricants, binders, and disintegrating agents.<br>
Because of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent the<br>
most advantageous oral dosage unit forms, in which case solid excipients are<br>
employed. If desired, tablets can be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous<br>
techniques. Such dosage forms can be prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy.<br>
In general, pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms are prepared by<br>
uniformly and intimately admixing the active ingredients with liquid carriers, finely<br>
dividad solid carriers, or both, and then shaping the prod'ict into the desired<br>
presentation if necessary.<br>
For example, a tablet can be prepared by compression or molding.<br>
Compressed tablets can be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active<br>
ingredients in a free-flowing form such as powder or granules, optionally mixed<br>
with an excipient. Molded tablets can be made by molding in a suitable machine a<br>
mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent.<br>
Examples of excipients that can be used in oral dosage forms of the invention<br>
include, but are not limited to, binders, fillers, d is integrants, and lubricants. Binders<br>
suitable for use in pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms include, but are<br>
not limited to, corn starch, potato starch, or other starches, gelatin, natural and<br>
synthetic gums such as acacia, sodium alginate, alginic acid, other alginates,<br>
powdered tragacanth, guar gum, cellulose and its derivatives (e.g., ethyl cellulose,<br>
cellulose acetate, carboxymethyl cellulose calcium, sodium carboxymethyl<br>
cellulose), polyvinyl pyrrolidone, methyl cellulose, pre-gelatinized starch,<br>
hydroKypropyl methyl cellulose, (e.g., Nos. 22Q8,2906, 2910), microcrystalline<br>
cellulose, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Suitable forms of microcrystalline cellulose include, but are not limited to,<br>
the materials sold as AVICEL-PH-101, AVICEL-PH-103 AVICEL RC-581,<br>
AVIGEL-PH-105 i available from FMC Corporation, American Viscose Division,<br>
Avicel Sales, Marcus Hook, PA), and mixtures thereof. One specific binder is a<br>
mixture of microcrystalline cellulose and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose sold as<br>
AVICEL RC-581, Suitable anhydrous or low moisture excipients or additives<br>
include AVICEL-PH-103J and Starch 1500 LM.<br>
Examples of fillers suitable for use in the pharmaceutical compositions and<br>
dosage forms disclosed herein include, but are not limited to, talc, calcium carbonate<br>
(e.g., granules or powder), microcrystalline cellulose, powdered cellulose, dextrates,<br>
kaolin, mannitol. silicic acid, sorbitol, starch, pre-gelatinized starch, and mixtures<br>
thereof. The binder or filler in pharmaceutical compositions of the invention is<br>
typically present in from about 50 to about 99 weight percent of the pharmaceutical<br>
composition or dosage form.<br>
Disintegrants are used in the compositions of the invention to provide tablets<br>
that disintegrate when exposed to an aqueous environment. Tablets that contain too<br>
much disintegrant may disintegrate in storage, while those that contain too little may<br>
not disintegrate at a desired rate or under the desired conditions. Thus, a sufficient<br>
amourtt of disintegrant that is neither too much nor too little to detrimentally alter<br>
the release of the active ingredients should be used to form solid oral dosage forms<br>
of the invention. The amount of disintegrant used varies based upon the type of<br>
formulation, and is readily discernible to those of ordinary skill in the art. Typical<br>
pharmaceutical compositions comprise from about 0.5 to about 15 weight percen: of.<br>
disintegrant, preferably from about 1 to about 5 weight percent of disintegrant.<br>
Disintegrants that can be used in pharmaceutical compositions and dosage<br>
forms of the invention include, but are not limited to, agar-agar, algiric acid,<br>
calcium carbonate, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, crospovidcne,<br>
polacrjlin potassium, sodium starch glycolate, potato or tapioca starch, other<br>
starches, pre-gelatinized starch; other starches, clays, other algins, other celluloses,<br>
gums, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Lubricants that can be used in pharmaceutical compositions and dosage<br>
forms of the invention include, but are not limited to, calcium stearate. magnesium<br>
stearate, mineral oil. light mineral oil, glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol. polyethylene<br>
glycol, other glycols, stearic acid, sodium lauryl sulfate, talc, hydrogenated<br>
vegetable oil (e.g., peanut oil, cottonseed oil, sunflower oil. sesame oil, olive oil.<br>
corn oil, and soybean oil), zinc stearate, ethyl oleate, ethyl laureate, agar, and<br>
mixtures thereof. Additional lubricants include, for example, a syloid silica gel<br>
(AEROSIL 200, manufactured by W.R. Grace Co. of Baltimore, MD). a coagula:?d<br>
aerosol of synthetic silica (marketed by Degussa Co. of Piano, TX), CAB-O-SIL a<br>
pyroganic silicon dioxide product sold by Cabot Co. of Boston, MA), and mixtures<br>
thereof. If used at all, lubricants are typically used in an amount of less than about 1<br>
weight percent of the pharmaceutical compositions or ddsage forms into which they<br>
are incorporated.<br>
2) Controlled Release Dosage Forms<br>
Active ingredients of the invention can be administered by controlled release<br>
means or by deliver.' devices that are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
Examples include, but are not limited to, those described in U.S. Patent Nos.:<br>
3,845,770; 3,916,899; 3,536,809; 3,598,123; and 4,008,719, 5,674,533, 5,059,595,<br>
5,591,767, 5,120,548, 5,073,543, 5,639,476, 5,354,556, and 5,733,566, each of<br>
which is incorporated herein by reference. Such dosage forms can be used to<br>
provide slow or controlled-release of one or more active ingredients using, for<br>
example, hydropropylmethyl cellulose, other polymer matrices, gels, permeable<br>
membranes, osmotic systems, multilayer coatings, microparticles, liposomes,<br>
microspheras, or a combination thereof to provide the desired release profile in<br>
varying proportions. Suitable controlled-release formulations known to those of<br>
ordinary skill in the art, including those described herein, can be readily selected for<br>
use with the active ingredients of the invention. The invention thus encompasses<br>
single unit dosage farms ruitable for oral administration such as, but not limited to,<br>
tablets capsules, gelcaps, and caplets that are adapted for controlled-release.<br>
All controlled-release pharmaceutical products have a common goal of<br>
improving drug therapy over that achieved by their non-controlled counterparts.<br>
Ideally, the use of an optimally designed controlled-release preparation in medical<br>
treatment is characterized by a minimum of drug substance being employed to cure<br>
or control the condition in a minimum amount of time. Advantages of controlledreleasa<br>
formulations include extended activity of the drug, reduced dosage<br>
frequency, and increased patient compliance.<br>
Most controiled-release formulations are designed to initially release an<br>
amount of drug (active ingredient) that promptly produces the desired therapeutic<br>
effect, and gradually and continually release of other amounts of diug to maintain<br>
this level of therapeutic or prophylactic effect over an extended period of time. In<br>
order to maintain this constant level of drug in the body, the drug must be released<br>
from the dosage form at a rate that will replace the amount of drug being<br>
metabolized and excreted from the body. Controlled-release of an active ingredient<br>
can be stimulated by various conditions including, but not limited to, pH,<br>
temperature, enzymes, water, or other physiological conditions or compounds.<br>
A particular extended release formulation of this invention comprises a<br>
therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of a compound of formula (1),<br>
(II), (JIII), (IV), (V), (VI), (VII), (VIII), (IX), (X), or Table 1, or a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salt, solvate, hydrate, c'athrate, or prodrug thereof, in spheroids which<br>
further comprise microcrystalline cellulose and, optionally, hydroxypropylmethyli<br>
cellulose coated with a mixture of ethyl cellulose and<br>
hydroxypropylmethylcellulose. Such extended release formulations can be prepared<br>
acconding to U.S. Patent No. 6,274,171, the entirely of which is incorporated herein<br>
by reference.<br>
A specific controlled-release formulation of this invention comprises from<br>
about 6% to about 40% a compound of formula (I), (II), (III), (IV), (V), (VI), (VII),<br>
(VIII), (IX), (X), or Table 1, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, hydrate,<br>
clathfate, or prodrug thereof, by weight, about 50% to about 94% microcrystalline<br>
cellulose, NF, by weight, and optionally from about 0.25% to about 1% by weight of<br>
hydroxypropyl-methylceilulose, USP, wherein the spheroids are coated with a film<br>
coatiig composition comprised of ethyl cellulose and<br>
hydroxypropylmethylcellulose.<br>
3) Parenteral Dosage Forms<br>
Parenteral dosage forms can be administered to patients by various routes<br>
including, but not limited to, subcutaneous, intravenous (including bolus injection),<br>
intramuscular, and intraarterial. Because their administration typically bypasses<br>
patients' natural defenses against contaminants, parenteral dosage forms are<br>
preferably sterile or capable of being sterilized prior to administration to a patient.<br>
Examples of parenteral dosage forms include, but are not limited to, solutions ready<br>
for injection, dry products ready to be dissolved or suspended in a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable vehicle for injection, suspensions ready for injection, and emulsions.<br>
Suitable vehicles that can be used to provide parenteral dosage forms of the<br>
invention are well known to those skilled in the art. Examples include, but are not<br>
limited to: Water for Injection USP; aqueous vehicles such as, but not limited to,<br>
Sodium Chloride Injection, Ringer's Injection, Dextrose Injection, Dextrose and<br>
Sodium Chloride Injection, and Lactated Ringer's Injection; water-miscible vehicles<br>
such as, but not limited to, ethyl alcohcl, polyethylene glycol, and polypropylene<br>
glycol; and non-aqueous vehicles such as, but not limited to, corn oil, cottonseed oil,<br>
peanut oil, sesame oil, ethyl oleate, isopropyl myristate, and benzyl benzoate.<br>
Compounds that increase the solubility of one or more of the active<br>
ingredients disclosed herein can also be incorporated into the parenteral dosage<br>
forms of the invention.<br>
4) Transdermal. Topical, and Mucosal Dosage Forms<br>
Transdermal, topical, and mucosal dosage forms of the invention include, but<br>
are not limited to. ophthalmic solutions, sprays, aerosols, creams, lotions, ointments,<br>
gels, solutions, emulsions, suspensions, or other forms known to one of skill in the<br>
art. See, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (1980 &amp; 1990) 16th and 18th<br>
eds., Mack Publishing, Easton PA and Introduction to Pharmaceutical Dosage<br>
Form$ (1985) 4th ed., Lea &amp; Febiger, Philadelphia. Dosage forms suitable for<br>
treating mucosal tissues within the oral cavity can be formulated as mouthwashes or<br>
as oral gels. Further, transdermal dosage forms include "reservoir type" or "matrix<br>
type" patches, which can be applied to the skin and worn for a specific period of<br>
time «o permit the penetration of a desired amount of active ingredients.<br>
Suitable excipients (e.g., carriers and diluents) and other materials that can<br>
be used to provide transdermal, topical, and mucosal dosage forms encompassed by<br>
this invention are well known to those skilled in the pharmaceutical arts, and depend<br>
on the particular tissue to which a given pharmaceutical composition or dosage form<br>
will be applied. \Vith that fact in mind, typical excipients include, but are not<br>
limited to, water, acetone, ethanol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butane-1,3-<br>
diol, isopropyl rmristate, isopropyl palmitate, mineral oil, and mixtures thereof to<br>
form lotions, tinctures, creams, emulsions, gels or ointments, which are non-toxic<br>
and pharmaceutically acceptable. Moisturizers or humectants can also be added to<br>
pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms if desired. Examples of such<br>
additional ingredients are well known in the art. See, e.g., Remington's<br>
Pharmaceutical Sciences (1980 &amp; 1990) 16th and 18th eds., Mack Publishing,<br>
Eastern PA.<br>
Depending on the specific tissue to be treated, additional components may be<br>
used pfior to, in conjunction with, or subsequent to treatment with active ingredients<br>
of the invention. For example, penetration enhancers can be used to assist in<br>
delivering the active ingredients to the tissue. Suitable penetration enhancers<br>
include, but are not limited to: acetone; various alcohols such as ethanol, oleyl, and<br>
tetrahydrofuryl; alkyl sulfoxides such as dimethyl sulfoxide; dimethyl acetamide;<br>
dimethyl formamide; polyethylene glycol; pyrrolidones such as<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone: Kollidon grades (Povidone, Polyvidone); urea; and various<br>
water-soluble or insoluble sugar esters such a Tween 80 (polysorbate 80) and Span<br>
60 (soribitan monostearate).<br>
The pH of a pharmaceutical composition or dosage form, or of the tissue to<br>
which the pharmaceutical composition or dosage form is applied, may also be<br>
adjusted to improve delivery of one or more active ingredients. Similarly, the<br>
polarity of a solvent rarrier, its ionic strength, or tonicity can be adjusted to improve<br>
delivery. Compounds such as stearates can also be added to pharmaceutical<br>
T<br>
compositions or dosage forms to advantageously alter the hydrophilicity or<br>
lipophilicity of one or more active ingredients so as to improve delivery. In this<br>
regard, stearates can serve as a lipid vehicle for the formulation, as an emulsifying<br>
agent or surfactant, and as a delivery-enhancing or penetration-enhancing agent.<br>
Different salts, hydrates or solvates of the active ingredients can be used to further<br>
adjust {he properties of the resulting composition.<br>
5) Dosage &amp; Frequency of Administration<br>
The amount of the compound or composition of the invention which will be<br>
effective in the prevention, treatment, management, or amelioration of a proliferative<br>
disorders, such as cancer, or one or more symptoms thereof, will vary with the<br>
nature and severity of the disease or condition, and the route by which the active<br>
ingredient is administered. The frequency and dosage will also vary according to<br>
factors specific for each patient depending on the specific therapy (e.g., therapeutic<br>
or prophylactic agents) administered, the severity of the disorder, disease, or<br>
condition, the route of administration, as well as age, body, weight, response, and<br>
the past medical history of the patient. Effective doses may be extrapolated from<br>
dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems. Suitable<br>
regiments can be selected by one skilled in the art by considering such factors and<br>
by following, for example, dosages reported in the literature and recommended in<br>
the Physician's Desk Reference (57th ed., 2003).<br>
Exemplary doses of a small molecule include milligram or n icrogram<br>
amounts of the small molecule per kilogram of subject or sample weight (e.g., about<br>
1 miqrogram per kilogram to about 500 milligrams per kilogram, about 100<br>
micrograms per kilogram to about 5 milligrams per kilogram, or about 1 microgram<br>
per kilogram to about 50 micrograms per kilogram).<br>
In general, the recommended daily dose range of a compound of the<br>
invention for the conditions described herein lie within the range of from about 0.01<br>
mg to about 1000 m§ per day, given as a single once-a-day dose preferably as<br>
divided doses throughout a day. In one embodiment, the daily dose is administered<br>
twice daily in equally divided doses. Specifically, a daily dose range should be from<br>
about 5 mg to about 500 mg per day, more specifically, between about 10 mg and<br>
about 200 mg per day. In managing the patient, the therapy should be initiated at a<br>
lower dose, perhaps about 1 mg to about 25 mg, and increased if necessary up to<br>
about 200 mg to about 1000 mg per day as either a single dose or divided doses,<br>
depending on the patient's global response. It may be necessary to use dosages of<br>
the attive ingredient outside the ranges disclosed herein in some cases, as will be<br>
appafent to those of ordinary skill in the art. Furthermore, it is noted that the<br>
clinician or treating physician will know how and when to interrupt, adjust, or<br>
terminate therapy in conjunction with individual patient response.<br>
Different therapeutically effective amounts may be applicable for different<br>
proliferative disorders, as will be readily known by those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
Similarly, amounts sufficient to prevent, manage, treat or ameliorate such<br>
proliferative disorders, but insufficient to cause, or sufficient to reduce, adverse<br>
effects associated with the'compounds of the invention are also encompassed by the<br>
above described dosage amounts and dose frequency schedules. Further, when a<br>
patient is administered multiple dosages of a compound of the invention, not all of<br>
the dosages need be the same. For example, the dosage administered to the patient<br>
may be increased to improve the prophylactic or therapeutic effect of the compound<br>
or it may be decreased to reduce one or more side effects that a particular patient is<br>
experiencing.<br>
In a specific embodiment, the dosage of the composition of the invention or a<br>
compound of the invention administered to prevent, treat, manage, or ameliorate a<br>
proliferative disorders, such as cancer, or one or more symptoms thereof in a patient<br>
is 150 ug/kg, preferably 250 ug/kg, 500 ug/kg, 1 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 25<br>
mg/k§, 50 mg/kg. 75 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg, 125 mg/kg, 150 mg/kg, or 200 mg/kg or<br>
more of a patient's body weight. In another embodiment, the dosage of the<br>
composition of the invention or a compound of the invention administered to<br>
prevent, treat, manage, or ameliorate a proliferative disorders, such as cancer, or one<br>
or mote symptoms thereof in a patient is a unit dose of 0.1 mg to 20 mg, 0.1 mg to<br>
15 mg, 0.1 mgto 12 mg, 0.1 mgto lOmg, 0.1 mg to 8 mg, 0.1 mgto7mg, 0.1 mg<br>
to 5 mg, 0.1 to 2.5 mg, 0.25 mg to 20 mg, 0.25 to 15 mg, 0.25 to 12mg, 0.25 to 10<br>
mg, 0.25 to 8 mg. 0.25 mg to 7m g, 0.25 mg to 5 mg, 0.5 mg to 2.5 mg, 1 mg to 20<br>
mg, 1 mg to 15 mg, 1 mg to 12 mg, 1 mg to 10 mg, 1 mg to 8 mg, 1 mg to 7 mg, 1<br>
mg to 5 mg, or 1 mg to 2.5 mg.<br>
The dosages of prophylactic or therapeutic agents other than compounds of<br>
the invention, which have been or are currently being used to prevent, treat, manage,<br>
or proliferative disorders, such as cancer, or one or more symptoms thereof can be<br>
used ia the combination therapies of the invention. Preferably, dosages lower than<br>
those which have been or are currently being used to prevent, treat, manage, or<br>
ameliorate a proliferative disorders, or one or more symptoms thereof, are used in<br>
the combination therapies of the invention. The recommended dosages of agents<br>
currently used for the prevention, treatment, management, or amelioration of a<br>
proliferative disorders, such as cancer, or one or more symptoms thereof, can<br>
obtained from any reference in the art including, but not limited to, Hardman e: al,<br>

In certain embodiments, one or more compounds of the invention and one or<br>
more other the therapies (e.g., prophylactic or therapcat'c agents) are cyclically<br>
administered. Cycling therapy involves the administration of a first therapy (e.g., a<br>
first prophylactic or therapeutic agents) for a period of time, followed by the<br>
administration of a second therapy (e.g., a second prophylactic or therapeutic agents)<br>
for a period of time, followed by the administration of a third therapy (e.g., a third<br>
prophylactic or therapeutic agents) for a period of time and so forth, and repeating<br>
this sequential administration, i.e., the cycle in order to reduce the development of<br>
resistance to one of the agents, to avoid or reduce the side effects of one of the<br>
agents, and/or to improve the efficacy of the treatment.<br>

Example 168: Inhibition of Hsp90<br>
Hsp90 protein was obtained from Stressgen (Cat#SPP-770). Assay buffer:<br>
100 mM Tris-HCl. Ph7.4, 20 mM KCI, 6 mM MgCl2. Malachite green (0.0812%<br>
w/v) (M9636) and polyviny alcohol USP (2.32% w/v) (PI 097) were obtained from<br>
Sigma. A Malachite Green Assay (see Methods Mol Med, 2003, 85:149 for method<br>
details) was used for examination of ATPase activity of Hsp90 protein. Briefly,<br>
Hsp90 protein in assay buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, Ph7.4, 20 mM KCI, 6 mM MgCI2)<br>
was mixed with ATP alone (negative control) or in the presence of Geldanamycin (a<br>
positive control) or Compound 108 in a 96-well plate. Malachite green reagent was<br>
added to the reaction. The mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 4 hours and sodium<br>
citrate buffer (34% w. v sodium citrate) was added to the reaction. The plate was<br>
read by an ELISA reader With an absorbance at 620 nm.<br>
As can be seen in Figure 1, 40 uM of geldanamycin, a natural product known<br>
to inhibit Hsp90 activity, the ATPase activity of Hsp90 was only slightly higher than<br>
background. 40 ^M Compound 108 showed an even greater inhibition of ATPase<br>
activity of Hsp90 than geldanamycin, and even at 4u.M Compound 108 showed<br>
significant inhibition of ATPase activity of Hsp90 protein.<br>
Example 169: Degradation of Hsp90 Client Proteins via Inhibition of Hsp90<br>
Activity<br>
A. Cells and Cell Culture<br>
Human high-Her2 breast carcinoma BT'474 (HTB-20), SK-BR-3 (HTB-30)<br>
and MCF-7 breast carcinoma (HTB-22) from American Type Culture Collection,<br>
VA, USA were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4 mM Lglutamine<br>
and antibiotics (lOOIU/ml penicillin and 100 ug/ml<br>
strept0mycine;GibcoBRL). To obtain exponential cell growth, cells were<br>
trypsinized, counted and seeded at a cell density of 0.5x106 cells /ml regularly, every<br>
3 days. All experiments were performed on day 1 after cell passage.<br>
B. Degradation of Her2 in Cells after Treatment with a Compound of the<br>
Invention<br>
BT-474 cells were treated with O.SfaM, 2uM, or 5uM of 17AAG (a positive<br>
control) or O.SjiM, 2|xM, or 5uM of Compound 108 or Compound 49 overnight in<br>
DMEM medium. After treatment, each cytoplasmic sample was prepared from<br>
IxlO6 cells by incubation of cell lysis buffer (#9803, cell Signaling Technology) on<br>
ice for 10 minutes. The resulting supernatant used as the cytosol fractions were<br>
%<br>
dissolved with sample buffer for SDS-PAGE and run on a SDS-PAGE gel, blotted<br>
onto a nitrocellulose membrane by using semi-dry transfer. Non-specific binding to<br>
nitrocellulose was blocked with 5% skim milk in TBS with 0.5% Tween at room<br>
temperature for 1 hour, then probed with anti-Her2/ErB2 mAb (rabbit IgG, #2242,<br>
Cell Signaling) and anti-Tubulin(T9026, Sigma) as housekeeping control protein.<br>
HRP-Conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) and HRP-conjugated horse anti-mouse<br>
IgG (H+L) were used as secondary Ab (#7074, #7076, Cell Signaling) and<br>
LumiGLO reagent, 20x Peroxide (#7003, Cell Signaling) was used for visualization.<br>
As can be seen from Figure 2, Her2, an Hsp90 client protein, is almost<br>
completely degraded when cells are treated with 5|aM of Compound 108 and<br>
partially degradated when cells are treated with 2^M and 0.5uM of Compound 108.<br>
Compound 49 which is even,more active than Compound 108 causes complete<br>
degradation of Her2 when cells are treated with 2pM and 5|oM and causes partial<br>
degradated when cells are treated with 0.5uM 17AAG is a known Hsp90 inhibitor<br>
and is used as a positive control.<br>
C. Fluorescent Staining of \isr2 on the Surface of Cells Treated _with a<br>
Compound of the Invention<br>
After treatment with a compound of the invention, cells were washed twice<br>
with IxPBS/r/oFBS, and then stained with anti-Her2- FITC (#340553, BD) for 50<br>
min at 4°C. Cells were then washed three times in FACS buffer before the fixation<br>
in 0,5 ml 1% paraformadehydrede. Data was acquired on a FACSCalibur system.<br>
Isotype-matched controls were used to establish the non-specific staining of samples<br>
and to set the fluorescent markers. A total 10,000 events were recorded from each<br>
sample. Data were analysed by using CellQuest software (BD Biosciances). The<br>

with lxPBS/l°orBS, and then stained in binding buffer with FITC-conjugated<br>
Annexin V and ?ropidium iodide (PI) (all obtained from BD Biosciences) for 30<br>
min at 4°C. Flc'.*. cytometric analyses was performed with FACSCalibur (BD<br>
Biosciences) and a total 10,000 events were recorded from each sample. Data vs ere<br>
analyzed by using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). The relative fluorescence<br>
was calculated after subtraction of the fluorescence of control.<br>
E- Degradation of c-Kit in Cells after Treatment with a Compound_of<br>
the Invention<br>
Two leukemia cell lines, HEL92.1.7 and Kasumi-1, were used for testing ckit<br>
degradation induced by Hsp90 inhibitors of the invention. The cells (3X10s per<br>
well) were treated with 17AAG (0.5 mM), Compound 188 or Compound 221 for<br>
about 18 h (see Figs. 3 and 4 for concentrations). The cells were collected and<br>
centrifuged (SORVALL RT 6000D) at 1200 rpm for 5 min. The supematants were<br>
discarded, and the cells were washed one time with IX PBS. After centrifugation<br>
the cells were stained with FITC conjugated c-kit antibody (MBL International, Cat#<br>
KOI05-4) in 100 ml IX PBS at 4°C for 1 h. The samples were read and analysized<br>
with FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dicknson).<br>
c-Kit, a tyrosine kinase receptor and one of the Hsp90 client proteins, was<br>
selected and used in a FACS-based degradation assay. The results of the assay<br>
showed that Compound 188 and Compound 221, induced c-kit ^gradation at 0.5<br>
and 0.05 nM in a dose-dependent manner. Surprisingly, 17-AAG, which is a potent<br>
Hsp90 inhibitor and is in phase 2 clinical trials, could not induce c-kit degradation at<br>
0.5 pM in two leukemia cell lines, HEL92.1.7 (see Fig. 3) and Kasumi-1 (see Fig.<br>
4). Since the compounds of the invention cause c-kit degradation more efficiently<br>
than other Hsp90 inhibitors, the compounds of the invention are expected to be more<br>
effective in the treatment of c-kit associated tumors, such as leukemias, mast cell<br>
tumors, small cell lung cancer, testicular cancer, some cancers of the gastrointestinal<br>
tract (including GIST), and some central nervous system.<br>
The results of the FACS analysis were confirmed with Western blot analysis<br>
(see Fig. 5). In Kasumi-1 cells (myelogenous leukemia), Compound 221 (100 nM<br>
and 400 nM) induced the degradation of c-Kit. In contrast, 17-AAG had no effect of<br>
c-Kit protein levels.<br>
F. Degradation of c-Met in Cells after Treatment with a Compound of<br>
the Invention<br>
We examined the ability of the Hsp90 inhibitors of the invention to induce<br>
the degradation of c-Met, an Hsp90 client protein that is expressed at high levels in<br>
several types of non-small cell lung cancer. NCI-HI 993 (ATCC, cat# CRL-5909)<br>
were seeded in 6-v-eIl plates at 5 X 105 cells/weil. 'The cells were treated with<br>
17AAG (100 nM or 400 nM) or Compound 221 (100 nM or 400 nM), and cell lysis<br>
was prepared 24 h after treatment. Equal amount of proteins were used for Western<br>
blot analysis. The compounds of the invention potently induced degrade tion of c-<br>
Met in this cell line due to inhibition of Hsp90 (see Fig. 6).<br>
Example 170: Compound 49 Displays Anti-tumor Activity Against the Human<br>
Tumor Cell Line MDA-MB-435S in a nude Mouse Xenograft<br>
Model<br>
The numan rumor cell line, MDA-MB-435S (ATCC #HTB-129; G. Ellison,<br>
et al., Uol Pathol. 55:294-299, 2002), was obtained from the American Type<br>
Culture Collection (Manassus, Virginia, USA). The cell line was cultured in<br>
growth media prepared from 50% Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (high<br>
glucose), 50% RPNfl Media 1640, 10% fetal bovine s ^m (FBS), 1% 100X Lglutarnine,<br>
1% 100X Penicillin-Streptomycin, 1% 100X sodium pyruvate and 1%<br>
100X MEM non-essential arhino acids. FBS was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich<br>
Corp. (St. Louis, Missouri, USA), and all other reagents were obtained from<br>
Invitrqgen Corp. (Carlsbad. California, USA). Approximately 4-5 x 10(6) cells that<br>
had been cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen were rapidly thawed at 37°C and<br>
transferred to a 175 cm2 tissue culture flask containing 50 ml of growth media and<br>
then incubated at 3~°C in a 5% CO: incubator. 'The growth media was replaced<br>
every 2-3 days untii the flask became 90% confluent, typically in 5-7 days. To<br>
passage and expand the cell line, a 90% confluent flask was washed with 10 ml of<br>
room temperature phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and the cells were disassociated<br>
by adding 5 ml IX Trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen) and incubating at 37°C until the<br>
cells detached frorr. the surface of the flask. To inactivate the trypsin, 5 ml of<br>
growth media was added and thep the contents of the flask were centrifuged to<br>
pellet the cells. The supernatant was aspirated and the cell pellet was resuspended<br>
in 10 ml of growth media and the cell number determined using a hemocytovneter.<br>
Approximately 1-5 \ 10(6) cells per flask were seeded into 175 cm2 flasks<br>
containing 50 ml of growth media and incubated at 37°C in a 5% CCn incubator.<br>
When the flasks reached 90% confluence, the above passaging process was<br>
repeated until sufficient cells had been obtained for implantation into mice.<br>
Six to eight week old, female Crl:CD-l-m/BR (nude) mice were obtained<br>
from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, Massachusetts, USA). Animals<br>
were housed 4-5/cage in micro-isolators, with a 12hr/12hr light/dark cycle,<br>
acclimated for at least 1 week prior to use and fed normal laboratory chow ad<br>
libitum. Studies were conducted on animals between 7 and 12 weeks of age at<br>
implantation. To implant tumor cells into nude mice, the cells were trypsinized as<br>
above, washed in PBS and resusupended at a concentration of 50 x 10(6) cells/ml in<br>
PBS. Using a 27 gauge needle and 1 cc syringe, 0.1 ml of the cell suspension was<br>
injected into the corpus adiposum of nude mice. The corpus adiposum is a fat body<br>
located in the ventral abdominal vicera in the right quadrant of the abdomen at the<br>
juncture of the os coxae (pelvic bone) and the os femoris (femur). Tumors were<br>
then permitted to develop in vivo until they reached approximately 150 mm3 in<br>
volume, which typically required 2-3 weeks following implantation. Tumor<br>
volumes (V) were calculated by caliper measurement of the width (W), length (L)<br>
and thickness (T) of tumors using the following formula: V = 0.5326 x (L x W x<br>
T). Animals were randomized into treatment groups so that the average tumor<br>
volumes of each group were similar at the start of dosing.<br>
Sock solutions of test compounds were prepared by dissolving the<br>
appropriate amounts of each compound in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) by<br>
sonication in an ultrasonic water bath. Stock solutions were prepared at the start of<br>
the study, stored at -20°C and diluted fresh each day for dosing. A solution of 20%<br>
Cremophore RH40 (polyoxyl 40 hydrogenated castor oil; BASF Corp.,<br>
Aktiengesellschaft Ludwigshafen, Germany) in 80% D5W (5% dextrose in water;<br>
Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, Illinois, USA) was also prepared by first<br>
heating 100% Cremophore RH40 at 50-60°C until liquefied and clear, diluting 1:5<br>
with 100% D5W, reheating again until clear and then mixing well. This solution<br>
was stored at room temperature for up to 3 months prior to use. To prepare<br>
formulations for daily dosing, DMSO stock solutions were diluted 1:10 with 20%<br>
Cremophore RH40. The final formulation for dosing contained 10% DMSO, 18%<br>
Cremophore RH40, 3.6% dextrose and 68.4% water and the appropriate amount of<br>
test aicicle. Animals were intraperitoneal (IP) injected with this solution at 10 ml<br>
per kg body weight on a schedule of 5 days per week (Monday thru Friday, with no<br>
dosing on Saturday and Sunday) for 3 weeks.<br>
As shown in Figure 7, treatment with 300 mg/kg body weight of Compound<br>
49 decreased the growth rate of MDA-MB-435S cells in nude mice to a greater<br>
extent than did a dose of 100 mg/kg body weight of the Hsp90 inhibitor 17-AAG.<br>
This effect was not associated with significant toxicity, as shown by the lack of an<br>
effect on body weights (Figure 8).<br>
Example 171; Compound 188 Displays Anti-tumor Activity Against Human<br>
Tumor Cells in a nude Mouse Xenograft Model<br>
The human squamous non-small cell lung cancer cell line, RERF-LC-A1<br>
(RCB0444; S. Kyoizumi, et al., Cancer. Res. 45:3274-3281, 1985), was obtained<br>
from the Riken Cell Bank (Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan). The cell line was "ultured in<br>
growth media prepared from 50% Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (high<br>
glucose), 50% RPMI Media 1640, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% 100X Lglutamine,<br>
1% 100X penicillin-streptomycin, 1% 100X sodium pyruvate and 1%<br>
100X MEM non-essential amino acids. FBS was obtained from American Type<br>
Culture Collection (Manassas, Virginia, USA) and all other reagents were obtained<br>
from Invitrogen Corp. (Carlsbad, California, USA). Approximately 4-5 x 10(6)<br>
cells that had been cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen were rapidly thawed at 37°C<br>
and transferred to a 175 cm2 tissue culture flask containing 50 ml of growth media<br>
and then incubated at 37°C in a 5% COz incubator.<br>
The growth media was replaced every 2-3 days until the flask became 90%<br>
confluent, typically in 5-7 days. To passage and expand the cell line, a 90%<br>
confluent flask was washed with 10 ml of room temperature phosphate buffered<br>
saline (PBS) and the cells were disassociated by adding 5 ml IX trypsin-EDTA<br>
(Invitrogen) and incubating at 37°C until the cells detached from the surface of :he<br>
flask. To inactivate the trypsin, 5 ml of growth media was added and then the<br>
contents of the flask were centrifuged to pellet the cells. The supernatant was<br>
aspirated and the cell pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of growth media and the cell<br>
number determined using a hemocytometer. Approximately 1-3 x 10(6) cells per<br>
flask were seeded into 175 cm. 2.flasks containing 50 ml of growth media and<br>
incubated at 37°C in a 5% C02 incubator. When the flasks readied 90%<br>
confluence, the above passaging process was repeated until sufficient cells had<br>
been obtained for implantation into mice.<br>
Seven to eight week old, female Crl:CD-l-m/BR (nude) mice were obtained<br>
from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, Massachusetts, USA). Animals<br>
were housed 4-5/cage in micro-isolators, with a 12hr/12hr light/dark cycle,<br>
acclimated for at least 1 week prior to use and fed normal laboratory chow ad<br>
libitum. Studies were conducted on animals between 8 and 12 weeks of age at<br>
implantation. To implant RERF-LC-AI tumor cells into nude mice, the cells were<br>
trypsinized as above, washed in PBS and resuspended at a concentration of 50 x<br>
10(6) cells/ml in 50% non-supplemented RPM1 Media 1640 and 50% Matrigel<br>
Basement Membrane Matri:: (#354234; BD Biosciences; Bedford, Massachusetts,<br>
USA). Using a 27 gauge needle and 1 cc syringe, 0.1 ml of the cell suspension was<br>
injected subcutaneously into the flank of each nude mouse. Tumor volumes (VI<br>
were calculated by caliper measurement of the width (W), length (L) and thickness<br>
(T) of tumors using the following formula: V = 0.5236 x (L x W x T).<br>
In vivo passaged RERF-LC-AI tumor cells (RERF-LC-AI™") were isolated<br>
to improve the rate of tumor implantation relative to the parental cell line in nude.<br>
mice. RERP-LC-AI tumors were permitted to develop in vivo until they reached<br>
approximately 250 mm3 in volume, which required approximately 3 weeks<br>
following implantation. Mice were euthanized via COi asphyxiation and their<br>
exteriors sterilized %vjth 70% ethanol in a laminar flow hood. Using sterile<br>
technique, tumors -.vere excised and diced in 50 ml PBS using a scalpel blade. A<br>
single cell suspension was prepared using a 55 ml Wheaton Safe-Grind tissue<br>
grinder (catalog £62400-358; VWR International, West Chester, Pennsylvania.<br>
USA) by plunging the pestle up and down 4-5 times without twisting. The<br>
suspension was strained through a 70 uM nylon cell strainer and then centrifugec to<br>
pellet the cells. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 0.1 M NfLtCl to lyse<br>
contaminating red blood cells and then immediately centrifuged to pellet the eel!;.<br>
The cell pellet was resuspended in growth media and seeded into 175 cm2 flasks<br>
containing 50 ml of growth media at 1-3 tumors/flask or approximately 10 x 10(6)<br>
cells/flask. After overnight incubation at 37°C in a 5% CO; incubator, nonadherent<br>
cells were removed by rinsing two times with PBS and then the cultures<br>
were fed with fresh growth media. When the flasks reached 90% confluence, the<br>
above passaging process was repeated u.itil sufficient cells had been obtained for<br>
implantation into mice.<br>
RERF-LC-AI™1" cells were then implanted as above and tumors were<br>
permifted to develop in vivo until the majority reached an average of 100-200 mm"'<br>
in tumor volume, which typically required 2-3 weeks following implantation.<br>
Animals with oblong or very small or large tumors were discarded, and only<br>
animals carrying rumors that displayed consistent growth rates were selected for<br>
studies. Animals were randomized into treatment groups so that the average tumor<br>
volumes of each group were similar at the start of dosing.<br>
TheHSP90 inhibitor, 17-a!lylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-<br>
AAG), was employed as a positive control (Albany Molecular Research, Albany,<br>
New York, USA). Stock solutions of test articles were prepared by dissolving the<br>
appropriate amounts of each compound in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) by<br>
sonication in an ultrasonic water bath. Stock solutions were prepared weekly,<br>
stored at -20°C and diluted fresh each day for dosing. A solution of 20%<br>
Cremophore RH40 (jx&gt;lyoxyl 40 hydrogenated castor oil; BASF Corp.,<br>
Aktiengesellschaft. Ludwigshafen, Germany) in 80% D5W (5% dextrose in water:<br>
Abbott Laboratories. North Chicago, Illinois, USA) was also prepared by first<br>
heating 100% Cremophore RH40 at 50-60°C until liquefied and clear, diluting 1:5<br>
with 100% D5W, reheating again until clear and then mixing well. This solution<br>
was stored at room temperature for up to 3 months prior to use. To prepare<br>
formulations for daily dosing, DMSO stock solutions were diluted 1:10 with 20° c<br>
Cremophore RH40. The final formulation for dosing contained 10% DMSO, 18°o<br>
