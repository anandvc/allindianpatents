				<td>Description:<br>
The invention concerns a leak monitoring unit for a ring spinning machine with<br>
drafting devices, on the top roller bearing and load anus of which pneumatically<br>
loaded top rollers are appointed, with a housing appointed in the compressed-air<br>
supply line of the spinning machine with a suspended solid particle moveable in it<br>
between a compressed-air inlet and compressed-air outlet, which is provided with at<br>
least one air penetration opening.<br>
Such equipment is already known as flow monitors for ring spinning machines with<br>
pneumatically loaded top rollers. However, all the constructions used hitherto have the<br>
drawback that, due to the small surface of cross-section of at least one air penetration<br>
opening of the suspended solid particle, the air supply to the drafting devices is<br>
invariably throttled. This small cross-section to the openings is necessary for leakage<br>
detection in order to be able to detect even the most minor leaks. When filling the<br>
system, for example, after starting the machine, rapid filling, is, however, required with<br>
corresponding large flow volumes. When changing batches, when the top roller<br>
bearing and load arms are opened or closed in sections, rapidly refilling the system is<br>
required with medium flow volumes. In order to be able to meet all these requirements,<br>
the flow monitors known hitherto have a bypass around the housing provided with one<br>
or several valves. To fill or refill the system, the flow monitor proper is bridged over<br>
by the bypass being opened by a corresponding valve control, whereby the large flow<br>
volumes required are retained. However, provision and control of these valves is costly<br>
and expensive.<br>
The present invention is based on the concept of creating a leak monitoring unit that<br>
meets all operational requirements in a constructively simple and inexpensive manner.<br>
The present invention provides a leak monitoring unit for a ring spinning machine<br>
provided with drafting devices having pneumatically loaded top rollers mounted<br>
on top roller bearing and load arms, said leak monitoring unit comprising: a<br>
housing mounted in a compressed air supply line of the ring spinning machine;<br>
a suspended solid particle movable in the housing between a compressed-air<br>
inlet and a first compressed-air outlet of said housing, said suspended solid<br>
particle being provided with at least one air penetration opening, characterized in<br>
that-<br>
said housing is provided in its side wall with a second compressed-air<br>
outlet which opens into said compressed air supply line outside the housing,<br>
said second compressed-air outlet being so mounted that when the pressure is<br>
very strong, the suspended solid particle can be moved past the second<br>
compressed-air outlet to allow compressed-air entering the housing to flow<br>
therethrough directly.<br>
The monitoring unit in accordance with this invention has but one single valve<br>
formed by the suspended solid particle. Bypass lines with further valves are not<br>
necessary here. With high air requirements, for example, when filling or refilling<br>
the system and concomitant increased difference in pressure between the<br>
compressed-air inlet and the two compressed-air outlets, the compressed-air<br>
suspended solid particle is pushed past the second outlet, whereby the<br>
compressed air can flow out through it directly. The suspended solid particle with<br>
its small air penetration openings can therefore no longer develop any throttle<br>
effect. With a low air flow, the suspended solid particle stays underneath the<br>
lateral outlet, so that the air must flow through the suspended solid particle"s air<br>
penetration openings. This enables even the smallest quantities of air leakages<br>
to be recorded. As a matter of expediency, the cross-section surfaces of the two<br>
compressed-air outlets may correspond approximately to the cross section<br>
surface of the compressed-air inlet. The cross-section surface of at least one of<br>
the suspended solid particle"s air penetration openings may be selected to<br>
correspond to the maximum admissible leakage size, whereby the sensitivity of<br>
the flow monitor is adjustable. As a matter of expediency, the suspended solid<br>
particle can be moved by the air flow against the spring force, so that it is always<br>
returned to its original position next to the compressed-air inlet opening, as soon<br>
as the flow pressure is reduced. Here, the suspended solid particle may be a<br>
magnetic one known per se, influencing a Reed contact. The signal triggered by<br>
the Reed contact can, for example, trigger an alarm and/or shut down the<br>
machine.<br>
One preferred example of execution of a leak monitoring unit in accordance with<br>
this invention is gone into greater detail below based on the accompanying<br>
drawing.<br>
The single figure shows monitoring unit 10 with housing 11, which is mounted in<br>
compressed-air supply line 12 of a not further described ring spinning machine.<br>
A magnetic suspended solid particle 13 can be moved inside housing 11. This<br>
magnetic suspended solid particle 13 influences a non-represented Reed<br>
contact, whereby, for example, an alarm or even machine shutdown can be<br>
triggered when a leak occurs. Magnetic suspended solid particle 13 is provided<br>
with a small air penetration opening 14 . Moreover, two compressed-air outlets<br>
15 and 16 are provided on housing 11, both opening into the machine"s<br>
compressed-air supply line 12 outside the housing. The first compressed-air<br>
outlet 15 is provided opposite compressed-air inlet 17. Therefore, when there is<br>
air flow, magnetic suspended solid particle 13 is moved from compressed-air<br>
inlet 17 towards compressed-air outlet 15. Should flow pressure occurring be<br>
very strong, magnetic suspended solid particle 13 is moved past the<br>
second compressed-air outlet 16, so that compressed air entering through inlet 17 can<br>
flow out directly through outlet 16 and not via the small air penetration opening 14 of<br>
magnetic suspended solid particle 13. This is how the high flow volume required is<br>
ensured for rapidly filling or refilling the system. On the other hand, with low flow<br>
pressure, magnetic suspended solid particle 13 stays underneath the lateral<br>
compressed-air outlet 16, so that the throttle effect of opening 14 is maintained and the<br>
Reed contact is triggered as required by the magnetic suspended solid particle. Unit 10<br>
is then in its regular monitoring mode.<br>
