				<td>Description<br>
Method for sampling a current or voltage profile and for<br>
forming sampling values, in particular for use in protection or<br>
control devices for energy transmission systems<br>
The invention relates to a method, in particular for use in<br>
protection or control devices for energy transmission systems,<br>
having the features according to the precharacterizing clause<br>
of claim 1.<br>
Such a method is disclosed in the German laid-open<br>
specification 199 33 684. In this method, a high-voltage or<br>
heavy-current signal is sampled using an internal clock which<br>
is synchronized with the globally available GPS (Global<br>
Positioning System) signal. The GPS signal thus predefines a<br>
system clock to which the sampling values are related. The<br>
sampling values are then evaluated for the purposes of<br>
protection, in particular for the purposes of differential<br>
protection.<br>
The invention is based on the object of specifying a method<br>
which can be used to form sampling values, which have little<br>
jitter and very little noise, with little outlay in terms of<br>
devices or hardware.<br>
On the basis of a method of the type specified at the outset,<br>
this object is achieved according to the invention by the<br>
characterizing features of claim 1. Advantageous refinements of<br>
the method according to the invention are specified in<br>
subclaims.<br>
Accordingly, the invention provides for an auxiliary clock or<br>
auxiliary clock signal which runs freely relative to the system<br>
clock to be used to form auxiliary sampling values, for the<br>
temporal offset of the sampling time of each auxiliary sampling<br>
value to be respectively determined relative to the system<br>
clock and temporal offset values which are specific to the<br>
auxiliary sampling values to be determined, and for the<br>
auxiliary sampling values<br>
to be subjected to resampling, in which the sampling values<br>
which are temporally related to the system clock are formed,<br>
using the temporal offset values which are specific to the<br>
auxiliary sampling values.<br>
A crucial advantage of the method according to the invention<br>
can be seen in the fact that less hardware than in previous<br>
sampling systems is needed overall to generate the sampling<br>
values since the auxiliary clock used for sampling runs freely<br>
and it is thus possible to completely dispense with phase<br>
tracking, for example on the basis of a PLL (Phase Locked Loop)<br>
circuit. Sampling is thus effected using a free-running clock<br>
and resampling is effected "only" arithmetically, for example,<br>
using the temporal offset values which have been determined.<br>
Another crucial advantage of the method according to the<br>
invention can be seen in the fact that the sampling values have<br>
very little jitter and noise. The inventors found that a<br>
sampling clock derived from a predefined system clock and<br>
phase-coupled to the latter may, under certain circumstances,<br>
have a relatively large amount of jitter and may result in a<br>
relatively large amount of noise in the sampling values. The<br>
invention begins at this point by dispensing with such phase<br>
coupling or phase tracking; instead of this, sampling is<br>
carried out independently of the system clock and an auxiliary<br>
clock which runs freely with respect to the system clock and is<br>
of high quality, in particular has little jitter, is used for<br>
upstream auxiliary sampling. The sampling times of the<br>
auxiliary sampling values are thus generally temporally offset<br>
or phase-shifted as desired with respect to the system clock;<br>
in order to nevertheless establish a temporal relationship with<br>
the system clock, the auxiliary sampling values are then<br>
subjected to resampling, to be precise using the temporal<br>
offset values which are specific to the auxiliary sampling<br>
values and have previously been recorded for each auxiliary<br>
sampling value during auxiliary sampling. The result is thus<br>
the formation of sampling values with the correct time base but<br>
with considerably<br>
less jitter and less noise because the system clock is used<br>
only during downstream resampling, which is only carried out<br>
numerically for example, but not for primary "physical"<br>
sampling.<br>
The GPS signal, the Galileo signal, a real-time SNTP signal, a<br>
system clock of an SDH network or a system clock signal derived<br>
using one or more of these signals is preferably used as the<br>
system clock.<br>
The output signal of a local free-running oscillator is<br>
preferably used as the auxiliary clock signal. The auxiliary<br>
clock signal can be generated, for example, using a central<br>
busbar protection device and can be fed into sampling devices<br>
which are connected to said central busbar protection device<br>
using the latter. The sampling devices may be integrated, for<br>
example, in measuring transducers which are connected to one or<br>
more energy transmission lines.<br>
Alternatively, the auxiliary clock signal may be derived from<br>
the signals of a real-time transmission network, in particular<br>
a real-time ETHERNET network.<br>
The temporal offset values are formed, for example, using a<br>
counter which counts the clock pulses of a predefined counting<br>
clock and is respectively reset by pulses of the system clock<br>
and the count, of which is respectively read out as the temporal<br>
offset value if the auxiliary clock is used to record an<br>
auxiliary sampling value. The count is clearly a measurement<br>
variable for the period of time which has passed between the<br>
last respective pulse of the system clock and the recording of<br>
the respective auxiliary sampling value.<br>
The sampling values formed using the method described are<br>
are processed further for the purposes of protection in<br>
protection or control devices.<br>
The invention also relates to an arrangement for sampling a<br>
current or voltage profile and for forming sampling values<br>
which are temporally related to a predefined system clock.<br>
With respect to such an arrangement, the invention is based on<br>
the object of ensuring that the sampling values have little<br>
jitter and have as little noise as possible.<br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved by means of<br>
an arrangement having an auxiliary sampling device and a<br>
resampling device: the system clock and an auxiliary clock,<br>
which runs freely relative to the system clock, are applied to<br>
the auxiliary sampling device and the latter uses the auxiliary<br>
clock to form auxiliary sampling values and temporal offset<br>
values which are specific to the auxiliary sampling values and<br>
each specify the temporal offset relative to the system clock<br>
for each sampling time. The resampling device is arranged<br>
downstream of the auxiliary sampling device and subjects the<br>
auxiliary sampling values of the auxiliary sampling device to<br>
resampling, in which the sampling values which are temporally<br>
related to the system clock are formed, using the temporal<br>
offset values which are specific to the auxiliary sampling<br>
values.<br>
With regard to the advantages of the arrangement according to<br>
the invention, reference is made to the above statements in<br>
connection with the method according to the invention.<br>
The auxiliary sampling device is preferably contained in a<br>
current or voltage converter if the intention is to form<br>
sampling values which relate to an energy transmission system.<br>
The resampling device may, for example, form part of a field<br>
device, in particular a protection device.<br>
The auxiliary sampling device and the resampling device are<br>
preferably connected to one another by means of a data<br>
transmission bus or a data transmission network.<br>
If a central busbar protection device is present in the energy<br>
transmission system, it is considered to be advantageous if the<br>
central busbar protection device forms the auxiliary clock and<br>
transmits it to the auxiliary sampling device.<br>
With a view to the formation of phasor measured values, it is<br>
considered to be advantageous if a phasor formation device<br>
which uses the sampling values to form current or voltage<br>
phasors is connected to the resampling device.<br>
The invention is explained in more detail below using exemplary<br>
embodiments; in this case, by way of example<br>

and<br>
figure 11 shows another exemplary embodiment of an arrangement<br>
according to the invention.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates an arrangement 10 for sampling a current<br>
or voltage profile and for forming a corresponding current or<br>
voltage phasor. In this case, the arrangement is explained, by<br>
way of example, for the situation in which a voltage signal<br>
U(t) is intended to be sampled and a voltage phasor U is<br>
intended to be formed.<br>
The arrangement 10 has an auxiliary sampling device 20, at the<br>
input E20a of which the voltage signal U(t) to be sampled is<br>
fed in. A further input E2 0b of the auxiliary sampling device<br>
20 is connected to an auxiliary clock generator 30 which<br>
generates a free-running auxiliary clock or auxiliary clock<br>
signal H on the output side and feeds it into the auxiliary<br>
sampling device 20.<br>
On the input side, the auxiliary sampling device 20 has an A/D<br>
converter 40 whose analog input is connected to the input E20a<br>
of the auxiliary device 20 and thus has the voltage signal U(t)<br>
applied to it. A measured value forming device 50 which<br>
transmits sampling values U(n) formed by the A/D converter 40<br>
to a downstream measured value memory 60 is arranged downstream<br>
of the A/D converter 40.<br>
The measured value forming device 50 is also connected to a<br>
memory or latch module 70 which has a counter 80 connected<br>
upstream of it on the input side. The reset input R80 of the<br>
counter 80 is connected to a GPS receiving device 90 which<br>
generates a GPS signal as the system clock or system clock<br>
signal G and feeds it into the counter 80. The system<br>
clock G generates a respective short pulse for each second, for<br>
example.<br>
A clock input T80 of the counter 80 is connected to a signal<br>
generator 100 which feeds a clock signal or counting clock T<br>
into the clock input T80 of the counter 80.<br>
An output A20 of the auxiliary sampling device 20 is formed by<br>
an output A60 of the measured value memory 60; the latter is<br>
connected to a resampling device 200 which has a phasor<br>
formation device 210 connected downstream of it.<br>
The resampling device 200 subjects the auxiliary sampling<br>
values U(n) of the analog/digital converter 40 to resampling<br>
and generates, on the output side, resampled voltage values<br>
U'(n) which are then converted into the voltage phasor U by the<br>
phasor formation device 210; the voltage phasor U is thus<br>
related to the system clock G of the GPS receiving device 90<br>
and forms a so-called synchronous phasor. The term synchronous<br>
phasor is used to mean that the phasor U is related to the<br>
system clock.<br>
The arrangement shown in figure 1 is operated, for example, as<br>
follows:<br>
The GPS receiving device 90 is used to generate, on the output<br>
side, the system clock G which is fed into the counter 80. At<br>
the same time, the signal generator 100 is used to feed the<br>
counting clock T into the counter 80 which then begins to<br>
count. The counter 80 is reset whenever the system clock G<br>
generates a pulse.<br>
The count Z of the counter 80 is respectively stored in the<br>
memory module 70 when it is triggered with the free-running<br>
auxiliary clock H. As soon as the auxiliary clock H thus<br>
generates its n-th clock pulse, both the A/D converter 40 is<br>
triggered and a sampling value U(n) is generated<br>
and the respective count Z(n) is simultaneously recorded in the<br>
memory module 70 and is transmitted to the measured value<br>
forming device 50 as a temporal offset value At(n) which is<br>
specific to the auxiliary sampling value. If the counting clock<br>
has a clock rate of fT = 1 GHz, the temporal offset value At(n)<br>
relative to the pulses of the system clock G can be determined<br>
with a temporal accuracy of 1 ns.<br>
The counter 80 and the memory module 70 thus together form a<br>
counting device which forms the temporal offset values At(n) by<br>
counting the clock pulses of the counting clock T, respectively<br>
resetting itself if a pulse of the system clock G is present<br>
and respectively outputting its count Z as a temporal offset<br>
value as soon as the auxiliary clock H is used to record an<br>
auxiliary sampling value U(n).<br>
The measured value forming device 50 transmits the respective<br>
auxiliary sampling value U(n) of the A/D converter 40, together<br>
with the associated temporal offset value At (n) which is<br>
specific to the auxiliary sampling value, to the measured value<br>
memory 60 which stores the auxiliary sampling value U(n), with<br>
the associated temporal offset value ?t(n) which is specific to<br>
the auxiliary sampling value, as a measured value pair (U(n);<br>
At(n)) .<br>
Although the auxiliary sampling value U(n) has not been sampled<br>
with the system clock G, it nevertheless has a known temporal<br>
phase angle with respect to the system clock G because the<br>
respective temporal relationship with the system clock G or<br>
with the respective preceding pulse of the system clock G has<br>
been defined, for each auxiliary sampling value U(n), by the<br>
temporal offset value At (n) which is specific to the auxiliary<br>
sampling value. In addition to the counter value Z, an absolute<br>
time statement TAS which states the time of the last pulse of<br>
the system clock in absolute terms may also be stored in the<br>
temporal offset value ?t(n) or with the temporal offset value<br>
 ?t (n) ; this makes it possible to determine the sampling time<br>
TAH for each auxiliary sampling value in absolute terms<br>
according to:<br>
TAH = TAS + Z * 1/fT.<br>
The resampling device 200 reads the auxiliary sampling values<br>
U(n), together with the associated temporal offset values At (n)<br>
which are specific to the auxiliary sampling values, from the<br>
measured value memory 60 and carries out "arithmetic"<br>
resampling using the system clock G. Resampled sampling values<br>
U'(n) which are related to the system clock G are generated on<br>
the output side during this resampling operation; a resampling<br>
rate which corresponds to an integer multiple of the system<br>
clock G is preferably used for this purpose. The sampling<br>
values U' (n) can then be used in the phasor formation device<br>
210 to form the voltage phasor U which forms a so-called<br>
synchronous phasor. As already explained, the term "synchronous<br>
phasor" should be understood in this context as meaning a<br>
phasor which is synchronized with the predefined system clock<br>
G.<br>
Figure 2 shows, by way of example, the voltage signal U(t)<br>
sampled by the free-running auxiliary clock H at a fixed<br>
sampling rate.<br>
In order to be able to calculate a phasor U which is as exact<br>
as possible for the purpose of characterizing the fundamental<br>
of the voltage signal U(t), the sampling frequency of the<br>
auxiliary clock H is preferably set in such a manner that it is<br>
an integer multiple of the frequency of the fundamental of the<br>
voltage signal U(t). In order to be able to meet this<br>
requirement, the frequency of the fundamental of the voltage<br>
signal U(t) is measured, for example. A multiple of the<br>
fundamental frequency determined in this manner is then used<br>
further as the auxiliary clock H.<br>
As already mentioned, a resampling method is used to adapt the<br>
sampling values U(n) to the system clock G. The resampling<br>
method is based on the theory of the Shannon sampling theorem.<br>
This theorem states that each ideally band-limited signal x can<br>
be interpolated using the si function:<br>
Figure 3 illustrates this situation using part of a sinusoidal<br>
function with the depicted si interpolation functions which<br>
make it possible to reconstruct sampled band-limited signals.<br>
An ideally band-limited function which is given at points 3, 4,<br>
5, ... etc. can thus be calculated at any desired other<br>
location by solving the Shannon equation for these points.<br>
There are now two possible ways of interpreting this function<br>
for resampling use:<br>
The first option is to place the extreme value of the<br>
interpolation function through tne given sampling values, as<br>
shown in figure 3. However, this variant is not particularly<br>
practical for resampling use since an infinite sum of all si<br>
functions would have to be calculated in this case for each<br>
sampling value.<br>
According to a second variant, use is made of the fact that,<br>
apart from at the sampling value to be interpolated, the si<br>
function assumes the value 0 at the location of all other<br>
sampling values. That is to say, if the signal is interpolated<br>
with the si function at the locations of the new sampling<br>
values, only one si function must be considered.<br>
If the si function is now positioned at the location of the new<br>
sampling value with the period duration of the new sampling<br>
interval and is calculated at the locations of the given<br>
sampling values, the new sampling value can be determined.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates this situation using resampling by means<br>
of an interpolation filter.<br>
In practice, of course, this interpolation should not be<br>
carried out directly with the si function since this function<br>
does not only have a value that is not equal to zero in a<br>
finite interval of time. However, simply cropping the function<br>
at the fifth zero crossing on both sides of the extreme value<br>
does not provide a frequency response which differs<br>
considerably from the ideal low-pass in the frequency range. In<br>
this case, it is better to limit the si function to a finite<br>
range with a window function. The Blackman window function is<br>
used for this purpose in the present example. In this case, a<br>
stop-band attenuation ratio of at least 60 dB is achieved.<br>
Although better values could be achieved with the known Kaiser<br>
function, this is at the expense of the window size. Since 60<br>
dB can be considered to be sufficient, a Kaiser window should<br>
preferably not be used.<br>
Figure 5 shows the interpolation function used in more detail.<br>
The curve denoted "xi" represents the Blackman window function<br>
which has been selected by way of example. The curve denoted<br>
"si" shows the si function which is not temporally limited. The<br>
curve denoted "hsi" is the interpolation function which has<br>
been temporally limited using the window function.<br>
Figure 6 shows the amplitude response associated with the<br>
illustrated pulse response using the example of a sampling rate<br>
reduction from 10 kHz to 5 kHz. As can be seen in figure 6, the<br>
interpolated signals are band-limited to the new half sampling<br>
frequency. The ripple in the passband is at most 0.2 10-4 .<br>
Figure 7 shows the characteristic curve in the passband. It can<br>
be seen in figure 7 that the ripple in the entire passband is<br>
on average considerably less than 10-4. This filter can thus be<br>
used to meet all the accuracy requirements even in the<br>
passband. As is not intended to be proven here any further, the<br>
This equation is the solution of a least-squares estimator<br>
which fits the interpolation function into the received<br>
sampling value stream at the desired location t0- The function<br>
w(t) is the Blackman window function.<br>
Figure 8 shows the implementation of resampling for the<br>
selected resampling method: a sampling value in the original<br>
sampling value stream on the basis of the auxiliary clock H is<br>
present at the times denoted with a cross. Resampling is<br>
intended to be carried out at the points denoted with a circle.<br>
A sampling rate which is synchronized with the system clock G<br>
and preferably corresponds to a multiple, for example an<br>
integer multiple, of the pulse rate of the system clock G is<br>
used for resampling. The designation "GPS sync pulse" marks, by<br>
way of example, one of the pulses of the GPS signal, one of<br>
which usually occurs each second.<br>
The ratio of the new sampling frequency to the old sampling<br>
frequency is 3/5 in this example. If the sampling value is<br>
intended to be calculated at the time t=0, an interpolation<br>
filter whose extreme value is precisely at the original<br>
sampling value 0 is used. In this case, the data window extends<br>
precisely w/2 sampling values into the past and w/2 sampling<br>
values into the future. In order to calculate the new sampling<br>
value at the point t=3, an interpolation filter whose extreme<br>
value has been shifted to the right by precisely 3/5 TA of the<br>
original sampling interval TA must be used. In total, five<br>
different sets of filter coefficients are thus needed to<br>
implement resampling in this example.<br>
The formulas in the table shown in figure 9 describe the<br>
proposed algorithm in detail.<br>
Figure 10 summarizes the exemplary method sequence once again<br>
in the form of a flowchart.<br>
The exact determination of the signal fundamental frequency f<br>
of the input signal U(t) is decisive for the accuracy of the<br>
synchronous phasor U determined. For this purpose, the<br>
frequency f is preferably determined from phasors of a<br>
plurality of successive data windows according to the following<br>
formula:<br><br>
The validity of the frequency measured value f can be derived<br>
from the development of the phase angle cp(t). The frequency<br>
measured value f determined is valid when the phase angle<br>
develops in a virtually linear manner. If sudden changes are<br>
determined in the profile of the measured phase angle, the data<br>
window must be repositioned for the frequency measurement.<br>
Resampling is carried out a second time in a second step with a<br>
frequency measured value f which is now valid. The phasor<br>
determined in this manner can then be used as a synchronous<br>
phasor. The method is continued in the recursion steps<br>
described.<br>
The specific technical implementation of the resampling method<br>
in the resampling device 200 can be effected, for example, in a<br>
manner as explained in "A flexible sampling-rate conversion<br>
method" (Smith, J.O. and Gosset, P.; 1984; Proceedings of the<br>
International Conference on Acoustic, Speech, and Signal<br>
Processing, San Diego, Volume 2, pages 19.4.1-19.4.2; New York.<br>
IEEE Press).<br>
Figure 11 illustrates another exemplary embodiment of an<br>
arrangement according to the invention which can also be used<br>
to carry out the method according to the invention.<br>
An energy transmission line 500 to which two measuring<br>
transducer units 510, 520 are connected is seen in figure 11.<br>
The two measuring transducer units 510 and 520 are each<br>
provided with an auxiliary sampling device 20 as has already<br>
been explained in connection with figure 1.<br>
The two measuring transducer units 510 and 520 are connected to<br>
a downstream protection device 530; the connection between the<br>
protection device 530 and the two measuring transducer units<br>
510 and 520 is ensured by a data bus or a data transmission<br>
network (for example an Ethernet network) 540 which can be<br>
provided with a switch 550, for example.<br>
As can also be seen in figure 11, a system clock G which is<br>
predefined, for example, by the GPS signal is applied to the<br>
two measuring transducer units 510 and 520 and the protection<br>
device 530.<br>
The protection device 530 is provided with a resampling device<br>
200 and a phasor formation device 210; the two components may<br>
correspond to the resampling device 200 and the phasor<br>
formation device 210 shown in figure 1.<br>
The arrangement shown in figure 11 can be operated as follows:<br>
Current and voltage measured values Ul(t) and II(t) and U2(t)<br>
and 12 (t) of the energy transmission line 500 are recorded<br>
using the measuring transducer units 510 and 520 and are<br>
subjected to analog/digital conversion. In this case, auxiliary<br>
sampling values II(n), 12(n), Ul(n) and U2(n) are formed on the<br>
output side according to an auxiliary clock H and are<br>
transmitted, together with the respective associated temporal<br>
offset values ?t(n) which are specific to the auxiliary<br>
sampling values, to the protection device 530 via the network<br>
540. The auxiliary clock H can be individually generated in<br>
each of the measuring transducer units 510 and 520<br>
or can be predefined from the outside for both measuring<br>
transducer units 510 and 520; for example, the auxiliary clock<br>
H is formed by a central busbar protection device 600 and is<br>
fed into the measuring transducer units 510 and 520.<br>
Alternatively, the auxiliary clock H can be derived from the<br>
data signals of the network 540 which is preferably a real-time<br>
transmission network, in particular a real-time ETHERNET<br>
network.<br>
The protection device 530 subjects the auxiliary sampling<br>
values Ul(n), U2(n), II(n) and 12(n) to resampling and<br>
generates, on the output side, sampling values Ul' (n) , U2' (n),<br>
I1'(n) and 12'(n) which are synchronized with the system clock<br>
G. The phasor formation device 210 of the protection device 530<br>
uses these sampling values Ul'(n), U2'(n), II'(n) and 12'(n) to<br>
form synchronous phasors Il, I2, U1 and U2.<br>
The synchronous phasors Il, I2, U1 and U2 can be evaluated<br>
inside the protection device 530 or outside the protection<br>
device 530, for example in a downstream control system or the<br>
like, in order to determine whether a fault, in particular a<br>
short circuit, has occurred on the energy transmission line<br>
500. The synchronous phasors Il, I2, Ul and U2 can thus be used<br>
to generate fault signals.<br>
