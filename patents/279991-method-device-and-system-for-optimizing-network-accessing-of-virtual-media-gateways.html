				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the communication technology field, and more<br>
particularly to a method, a device, and a system for optimizing network accessing of virtual<br>
media gateways.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring to FIG 1, in a networking structure of a circuit switched domain based on<br>
separation architecture mobile Softswitch, a Universal Mobile Telecommunications System<br>
(UMTS) Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN) 100 is connected to a media gateway<br>
(MGW) 101 and a mobile-services switching center server (MSC server) 102 through lu<br>
interfaces. A base station subsystem (BSS) 103 is connected to the MGW 101 and the<br>
MSC server 102 through A interfaces. A service control point (SCP) 104 is connected to<br>
the MSC server 102 and a gateway MSC server (GMSC server) 105 through CAP interfaces.<br>
A home location register (HLR) 106 is connected to the MSC server 102 through a D<br>
interface, and is connected to the GMSC server 105 through a C interface.<br>
The MSC server 102 and the GMSC server 105 are connected through an Nc<br>
interface. The Nc interface is based on the Bearer Independent Call Control (BICC)<br>
signaling, which is adapted to establish and release inter-office bearers, and may also be<br>
adapted to control a plurality of bearers including IP and ATM. The MSC server 102 and<br>
the GMSC server 105 control the MGWs 101 through Mc interfaces. The Mc interfaces<br>
usually adopt H.248 signaling. The MGWs 101 are connected with each other through an<br>
Nb interface. In addition, the MGW 101 is also connected to a public switch telephone<br>
network (PSTN) 107.<br>
In consideration of disaster recovery, one physical MGW may be virtualized into a<br>
 <br>
plurality of virtual MGWs (VMGWs). Each virtual MGW is controlled by one MSC<br>
server. Referring to the schematic view of a networking structure shown in FIG 2, a<br>
physical MGW 1 is virtualized into a VMGW 11 and a VMGW 12, and a physical MGW 2<br>
is virtualized into a VMGW 21 and a VMGW 22. The VMGW 11 and VMGW 21 are<br>
controlled by the MSC server 1, and the VMGW 12 and VMGW 22 are controlled by the<br>
MSC server 2.<br>
As the VMGWs are introduced, inter-office calls need to be optimized. In the prior<br>
art, the BICC may indicate a locally selected gateway identifier in the call signaling.<br>
When a peer office receives the call signaling, a gateway identifier used by the local office<br>
may be selected according to the gateway identifier selected by the peer opposite office.<br>
Thus, the same physical gateway may be selected. Referring to FIG. 3, the call process is<br>
as follows.<br>
In Step 300, the MSC server 1 and the VMGW 11 negotiate to establish a bearer<br>
connection with T2 in C1.<br>
In Step 301, the MSC server 1 sends BICC call signaling to the MSC server 2. The<br>
gateway identifier of the VMGW 11 is indicated in the signaling.<br>
In Step 302, after the MSC server 2 receives the signaling, the VMGW 12 is<br>
selected according to the gateway identifier of the VMGW 11 indicated by the signaling to<br>
establish a bearer connection with T3 in C2, thereby establishing the bearers on the same<br>
physical MGW 1.<br>
C and T in the process shown in FIG 3 represent a context and a termination in the<br>
H.248 protocol respectively.<br>
However, the method only realizes the selection of the gateway, but not the<br>
optimization of networking. Taking the 2G scenario for example, the topology of the<br>
bearer between two VMGWs of the same physical MGW is as shown in FIG 4. A<br>
transcoder (TC) mainly implements the transcoding, that is, the voice is transformed from a<br>
 <br>
pulse code modulation (PCM) bit stream (G.711) of time division multiplexing (TDM) into<br>
compressed code (such as AMR and G.729) suitable for transmission in an IP/ATM bearer<br>
network. It can be seen from the above description that, the above method causes waste of<br>
resources of the TC and waste of network resources for transmission, and lowers the voice<br>
quality.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a method, a device, and a system for optimizing<br>
network accessing of VMGWs, which solve problems of resource waste of a TC, resource<br>
waste of network transmission, and voice quality degradation in the prior art.<br>
The present invention provides the following technical solutions.<br>
A method for optimizing network accessing of VMGWs is provided. The method<br>
is as follows:<br>
network entities for controlling the VMGWs instruct the VMGWs in a same<br>
MGW to activate optimization of specific terminations in specific physical contexts<br>
respectively; and<br>
after determining that a connection relation exists between the specific physical<br>
contexts, the MGW directly connects the specific terminations.<br>
According to the method, when the MGW directly connects the specific<br>
terminations, if the specific terminations have already been respectively connected to a TC,<br>
the connections between the specific terminations and the TC are cut off respectively.<br>
The network entities instruct the VMGWs in the MGW respectively according to<br>
service changes to deactivate the optimization of the specific terminations in the specific<br>
physical contexts. The MGW cuts off connections between the specific terminations<br>
according to the instructions of deactivating the optimization, and establishes a bearer<br>
connection through other terminations.<br>
 <br>
When the MGW directly connects the specific terminations, other bypassed<br>
terminations are reserved; when the optimization is deactivated, all original bearer<br>
connections are recovered by the other reserved terminations.<br>
The network entities instruct the MGW through extended protocol messages to<br>
activate or to deactivate the optimization of the specific terminations in the specific<br>
physical contexts.<br>
After the MGW activates or deactivates the optimization of the specific terminations<br>
in the specific physical contexts, events of activating or deactivating the optimization are<br>
reported to the network entities.<br>
When the MGW activates or deactivates the optimization of the specific<br>
terminations in the specific physical contexts, voice channels are switched smoothly.<br>
A gateway device is adapted to perform bearer-related operations and media stream<br>
processing according to instructions of control entities. The gateway device includes at<br>
least two virtual gateway devices. The gateway device includes a receiving unit, a<br>
determining unit, and a processing unit.<br>
The receiving unit is adapted to receive instructions of the control entities. The<br>
instructions are to activate optimization of specific terminations in physical contexts<br>
specified by the control entities.<br>
The determining unit is adapted to determine whether a connection relation exists<br>
between the specific physical contexts or not.<br>
The processing unit is adapted to directly connect the specific terminations when it<br>
is determined that the connection relation exists between the specific physical contexts.<br>
When the instructions are to deactivate the optimization of the specific terminations<br>
in the specific physical contexts, the processing unit is further adapted to cut off<br>
connections between the specific terminations, and establish bearer connections through<br>
 <br>
other teminations.<br>
A network system includes an MGW and network entities connected to the MGW<br>
and controlling VMGWs in the MGW. The network entities are adapted to instruct the<br>
VMGWs in the same MGW to activate optimization of specific terminations in specific<br>
physical contexts respectively. The MGW is adapted to receive the instructions of<br>
activating the optimization from the network entities, and directly connect the specific<br>
terminations after it is determined that a connection relation exists between the specific<br>
physical contexts.<br>
When the MGW directly connects the specific terminations, if the specific<br>
terminations are already connected to a TC respectively, connections between the specific<br>
terminations and the TC are then cut off respectively.<br>
The network entities instruct the VMGWs in the MGW respectively according to<br>
service changes to deactivate the optimization of the specific terminations in the specific<br>
physical contexts. The MGW cuts off the connections between the specific terminations<br>
according to the instructions of deactivating the optimization, and establishes bearer<br>
connections through other terminations.<br>
When the MGW directly connects the specific terminations, other bypassed<br>
terminations are reserved. When the optimization is deactivated, the original bearer<br>
connections are recovered by the other reserved terminations.<br>
According to embodiments of the present invention, by connecting two terminations<br>
specified in physical contexts specified by the MSC servers in the two VMGWs of the same<br>
MGW, network accessing between the physical contexts of the VMGWs is optimized.<br>
Thus, TC resources are not occupied, and network resources such as IP/ATM are not<br>
occupied for transmission, so that voice quality is greatly improved.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS<br>
In this embodiment, a UMTS is taken as an example to illustrate the process that an<br>
MGW activates or deactivates optimization of specific terminations in specific physical<br>
contexts according to the instructions from network entities controllmg VMGWs, The<br>
processes in code division multiple addressing (CDMA) Softswitch or fixed Softswitch are<br>
similar to that in this embodiment.<br>
Referring to FIG 5, in this embodiment, a network system structure includes an<br>
MGW 500, and network entities 501 connected to the MGW 500 and controlling VMGWs<br>
 <br>
in the MGW 500. The network entities 501 are adapted to instruct the VMGWs in the<br>
same MGW respectively to activate optimization of the specific terminations in the specific<br>
physical contexts. The MGW 500 is adapted to receive the instructions of activating<br>
optimization from the network entities, determine whether a connection relation exists<br>
between the specific physical contexts or not according to bearer-related information<br>
(including corresponding IP addresses and port numbers of the terminations), and directly<br>
cormect the specific terminations after determining that the connection relation exists. The<br>
network entities 501 may be MSC servers or MSCe (in a CDMA2000 system). In FIG 5,<br>
the MSC servers are taken for example to illustrate the network system in this embodiment.<br>
In order to clearly illustrate the method of the present invention, an example in<br>
which two MSC servers instruct two VMGWs in the same MGW to activate the<br>
optimization for the specific terminations in the specific physical contexts is taken in the<br>
illustration. The process that more than two VMGWs activate the optimization is similar<br>
to this process.<br>
After the inter-office bearer is established on the MGW 500, the MSC servers 501<br>
first determine whether the inter-office bearer is established on the two VMGWs 5000 and<br>
5001 of the MGW 500 or not. When it is determined that the inter-office bearer is<br>
established on the two VMGWs 5000 and 5001 of the MGW 500, the MSC servers 501<br>
deliver instructions of activating the optimization to the MGW 500, so as to connect the<br>
terminations in the specific physical contexts of the two VMGWs 5000 and 5001. The<br>
terminations are the terminations specified by the MSC servers 501.<br>
After the MGW 500 receives the instructions of activating the optimization from the<br>
MSC servers 501, the MGW 500 first determines whether the conditions for activating the<br>
optimization are satisfied, that is, whether a connection relation exists between the specific<br>
physical contexts, and when it is determined that the connection relation exists between the<br>
specific physical contexts, the MGW 500 connects the two specific terminations in the<br>
specific physical contexts in the two VMGWs 5000 and 5001. Meanwhile, the MGW 500<br>
 <br>
also bypasses the original bearer connections, that is, when the specific terminations have<br>
already been connected to a TC, the connections between the specific terminations and the<br>
TC are cut off respectively to release the resources of the TC.<br>
The MSC servers 501 may deliver the instructions of deactivating the optimization<br>
to the two VMGWs 5000 and 5001 in the MGW 500 according to service changes (such as<br>
switching). The connections between the terminations specified by the MSC server 501<br>
are then cut off, and bearer connections are established with other terminations in the<br>
physical contexts in the two VMGWs 5000 and 5001. The MSC servers 501 deliver<br>
instructions of activating and deactivating the optimization to the two VMGWs 5000 and<br>
5001 through extended protocol messages (for example, H.248 messages).<br>
Preferably, when the MGW 500 activates the optimization, other bypassed<br>
terminations in the physical contexts of the original two VMGWs 5000 and 5001 are<br>
reserved. When the MGW 500 deactivates the optimization, the original bearer<br>
cormection is recovered through the other reserved terminations, thereby deactivating the<br>
optimization rapidly.<br>
After the MGW 500 completes the operation of activating or deactivating the<br>
optimization of the specific terminations in the specific physical contexts, the events of<br>
activating or deactivating the optimization are reported to the MSC servers 501.<br>
Preferably, in order to reduce interferences to the user as much as possible, when the<br>
MGW 500 activates or deactivates the optimization of the specific terminations in the<br>
specific physical contexts, voice channels are also switched smoothly. For example, the<br>
original voice channel is still reserved during the switching process. After the switching is<br>
completed, the original voice channel is then cut off.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, in this embodiment, the MGW 500 includes a receiving unit 600,<br>
a determining unit 601, and a processing unit 602. The receiving unit 600 is adapted to<br>
receive the instructions from the MSC servers. The instructions are to activate<br>
 <br>
optimization of the specific terminations in the physical contexts specified by the two<br>
VMGWs in the same MGW. The determining unit 601 is adapted to determine whether a<br>
connection relation exists between the specific physical contexts or not. The processing<br>
unit 602 is adapted to connect the specific terminations after it is determined that the<br>
connection relation exists between the specific physical contexts. When the instructions<br>
are to deactivate the optimization of the specific terminations, the processing unit 602 is<br>
also adapted to cut off the connections between the specific terminations, and establish<br>
bearer connections through other terminations. In addition, the MGW 500 further includes<br>
a sending unit 603, which is adapted to report the events of activating and deactivating the<br>
optimization to the MSC servers 501.<br>
In order to illustrate the method of the present invention more clearly, a VMGW 1<br>
and a VMGW 2 in a same MGW are taken as an example for illustration. The VMGW 1<br>
and the VMGW 2 are controlled by an MSC server 1 and an MSC server 2 respectively.<br>
The physical context specified by the MSC server in the VMGW 1 is referred to as CI, in<br>
which the specific termination to be optimized is Tl, and the termination of the original<br>
bearer connection is T2. The physical context specified by the MSC server in the VMGW<br>
2 is referred to as C2, in which the specific termination to be optimized is T4, and the<br>
termination of the original bearer connection is T3. FIG. 7 is a topological view of the<br>
bearer between the VMGWs after the optimization.<br>
Referring to FIG 8, in this embodiment, the process that VMGWs activate and<br>
deactivate the optimization is as follows.<br>
In Step 800, the MSC server 1 and the VMGW 1 negotiate to establish a bearer<br>
connection with T2 in CI.<br>
In Step 801, the MSC server 1 sends BICC call signaling to the MSC server 2. A<br>
gateway identifier of the VMGW 1 is indicated in the signaling.<br>
In Step 802, after the MSC server 2 receives the signaling, the VMGW 2 is selected<br>
 <br>
according to the gateway identifier of the VMGW 1 indicated by the signaling to establish<br>
bearer connection with T3 in C2, thereby establishing the bearers on a same physical MGW.<br>
In Step 803, the MSC server 1 controlling the VMGW 1 and the MSC server 2<br>
controlling the VMGW 2 determine whether the VMGW 1 and the VMGW 2 belong to the<br>
same MGW or not.<br>
In Step 804a-804b, after the MSC servers 1 and 2 determine that the VMGWs 1 and<br>
2 belong to the same MGW, the instructions of activating the optimization are delivered to<br>
the VMGWs 1 and 2 to activate the optimization of the specific terminations Tl and T4 in<br>
the specific physical contexts C1 and C2.<br>
In Step 805, after the same MGW receives the instructions of activating the<br>
optimization, it is determined whether the VMGWs 1 and 2 satisfy conditions of the<br>
optimization or not according to the bearer-related information (including corresponding IP<br>
addresses and port numbers of the terminations), that is, whether a connection relation<br>
exists between the physical contexts C1 and C2 or not.<br>
In Step 806, when the same MGW determines that the connection relation exists<br>
between the physical contexts C1 and C2 of the VMGWs 1 and 2, the optimization is<br>
activated, that is, Tl in C1 and T4 in C2 are connected.<br>
In Step 807, after the same MGW completes activating the optimization, the events<br>
of activating the optimization are reported to the MSC servers 1 and 2.<br>
In Step 808a-808b, when services are changed (for example, switched), the MSC<br>
server 1 controlling the VMGW 1 and the MSC server 2 controlling the VMGW 2 deliver<br>
instructions of deactivating the optimization to the VMGW 1 and VMGW 2, that is, to<br>
deactivate the optimization of the specific terminations Tl and T4 in the specific physical<br>
contexts C1 and C2.<br>
In Step 809, after the same MGW receives the instructions of deactivating the<br>
 <br>
optimization, the optimization is deactivated. That is, the resources of the TC are applied<br>
for, connections between T1 in C1 and T4 in C2 are cut off, T1 and T2 are connected<br>
through the TC, T3 and T4 are connected through the TC, and T2 and T3 are connected<br>
through the IP/ATM network.<br>
In Step 810, after the same MOW completes deactivating the optimization, the<br>
events of deactivating the optimization are reported to the MSC servers 1 and 2.<br>
In Step 806, at the same time, as Tl in C1 and T4 in C2 are connected by the same<br>
MOW, if Tl and T4 are already connected to the TC respectively, then the connection<br>
between Tl and the TC, and the connection between T4 and the TC are both cut off to<br>
release the resources of the TC. The same MOW still reserves T2 and T3 originally<br>
connected to the IP/ATM network, so that the operation of deactivating the optimization is<br>
completed rapidly in the following steps.<br>
In Step 809, the same MGW recovers the original bearer connections through T2<br>
and T3. T2 and T3 mentioned here are the two bypassed terminations that are reserved<br>
when the same MGW activates the optimization. Thus, the optimization can be<br>
deactivated rapidly. Here, bearer connections may be established again through other<br>
terminations.<br>
Although this embodiment is illustrated by taking the MGW in the UMTS system as<br>
an example, the present invention is not limited to the embodiment. The method is also<br>
applicable to a network device having similar functions as the MGW in other<br>
communication systems.<br>
It is known from the above embodiment that, in the present invention, by connecting<br>
the two specific terminations in the physical contexts specified by the MSC servers in the<br>
two VMGWs in the same MGW, the network accessing between the physical contexts of<br>
the VMGWs is optimized. The TC resources and network resources such as IP/ATM do<br>
not need to be occupied for transmission, and the voice quality is improved greatly.<br>
 <br>
Further, when the VMGWs activate the optimization, the terminations originally connected<br>
to the IP/ATM network are reserved, so that the VMGWs may deactivate the optimization<br>
rapidly.<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that, various modifications and<br>
variations can be made to the present invention without departing from the scope or spirit of<br>
the invention, hi view of the foregoing, it is intended that the present invention cover<br>

a media gateway, MGW, and a network entity connected to the MGW and controlling<br>
virtual media gateways, VMGWs, in the MGW, the network entity is adapted to instruct the<br>
 <br>
VMGWs in the same MGW to activate optimization of specific terminations in specific<br>
physical contexts respectively; the MGW is adapted to receive the instructions of activating<br>
the optimization from the network entity, and directly connect the specific terminations<br>
after it is determined that a connection relation exists between the specific physical<br>
contexts.<br>
11.	The system according to the claim 10, wherein, when the MGW directly cormects<br>
the specific terminations, if the specific terminations are already cormected to a transcoder<br>
respectively, connections between the specific terminations and the transcoder are then cut<br>
off respectively.<br>
12.	The system according to the claim 10, wherein, the network entity instruct the<br>
VMGWs in the MGW respectively according to service changes to deactivate the<br>
optimization of the specific terminations in the specific physical contexts, the MGW cuts<br>
off the cotmections between the specific terminations according to the instructions of<br>
deactivating the optimization, and establishes bearer connections through other<br>
terminations.<br>
13.	The system according to claim 12, wherein, when the MGW directly connects the<br>
specific terminations, other bypassed terminations are reserved, and when the optimization<br>
is deactivated, the original bearer connections are recovered by the other reserved<br>
