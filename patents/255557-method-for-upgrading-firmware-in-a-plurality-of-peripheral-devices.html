				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates in general to the field of Multi Function Peripherals (MFP) devices. Further, the present invention relates to the MFP devices and associated external network interface card (NIC) with a single image for firmware upgradation process. More particularly the present invention relates to an enhanced method for upgradation of firmware of various peripheral devices.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
The existing technology involves the MFP devices connected to the PSTN network only. In order to make the MFP device network enabled the MFP boards are connected with the NIC cards via the PCI or Shared Memory mechanisms. The data transfer/communication between MFP and NIC are through PCI or through the Shared Memory mechanisms.<br>
In this each board MFP or NIC will have their own set of firmware to be downloaded on to the MFP or NIC cards. So, whenever we need to upgrade with the new firmware then individually the MFP and NIC firmware will be downloaded or upgraded using network, Parallel cable, USB or Serial mechanisms.<br>
The existing mechanisms provide different mechanism to upgrade or download the firmware individually. For the end user it's difficult to know that both the MFP or NIC card firmware are changed and he should also know that different procedures needs to be followed for these firmware's. Currently, either MFP or NIC will be<br><br>
upgraded according to the user's choice. Here user's choice means user knows that he needs to upgrade the MFP firmware or NIC firmware.<br>
Another problem with maintaining different firmware is that the software should always make sure that both MFP and NIC are checked against their current versions for proper functioning. The present invention involves up-gradation of the firmware in the NIC first and then the firmware in the MFP hardware. It requires that certain procedures or steps to be followed in case the firmwares are not upgraded correctly. The problem can be circumvented by incorporating simple upgradation process with a single firmware image. The existing art is explained in the Figures 1 and 2. The upgradation of the MFP firmware is carried out either through parallel port or through network or through PSTN network. The up-gradation of the NIC firmware is done through TFTP server or any other protocol service and also it can be upgraded using PSTN also.<br>
Since the existing art needs two images, one in MFP and the other in NIC, one needs to go through two different upgradation processes, one for the MFP board and the other for the NIC card. The MFP/ printer firmware is upgraded through parallel port cable or through network and the NIC firmware is upgraded through TFTP server. The two images which are downloaded can be of incompatible versions and this can result in improper functioning of the MFP.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of the invention is to invent a method to provide simple solution for upgrading firmware of various peripheral devices.<br>
It is another object of the invention that instead of using two images for the firmware in the MFP and the NIC, a single image will be used which can be embedded in the MFP and can be downloaded to NIC through any of the inter process communication methods, shared memory or PCI.<br>
It is another object of the invention to make the firmware upgradation process simple which can be carried out in less time.<br>
It is another object of the invention to enable upradation of firmware for different boards under different environmental setups where the User or Super user need not be concerned with path in which the files are downloaded.<br>
It is another object of the invention wherein the user just fires the file and watches out the automated up-gradation of Firmware into the respective Flashes.<br>
It is another object of the invention to download only a single image through network and hence one need not search for parallel port or serial port cables for the downloading process.<br><br>
The invention proposes a method of providing a single downloadable file which is a combination of the firmware images of MFP and NIC. This single image contains headers to detect the parts of the image that can be burnt into respective flashes of the MFP and the NIC.<br>
Accordingly, this invention explains a method for upgradation of firmware of various peripheral devices comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	merging the MFP and NIC image into one image;<br>
(b)	downloading the images for the firmware embedded in the MFP and the NIC through any of the inter process communication methods, shared memory or PCI;<br>
(c)	wherein the said downloading of the images is characterized by checking whether the image which is receiving is for the NIC or MFP through the file opcode;<br>
(d)	downloading the split image into MFP flash and remaining part into NIC Flash;<br>
(e)	checking and validating by the MFP whether the beginning of the image belongs to MFP firmware or NIC firmware;<br>
(f)	flashing the image on to MFP board first, if it belongs to MFP;<br>
(g)	transferring the NIC image to NIC card via Shared Memory or via PCI bus; and<br>
(h) upgrading the firmware.<br>
The MFP and NIC images are separated by File Op-code wherein the said<br><br>
separation of the files are done during parsing of the files. When images are merged the image information is stored as Header information. The header information contains the File/Image Op-code which indicates which particular image is in the beginning of the file. A file type field in the said information indicated the type of the executable image. Initial bytes in the said information indicates the executable images for a particular type of image ensuring continues downloading of images on to the Flash. A check sum is added in the said information to avoid any loss or any change in the data during the transmission over internet or using the PSTN or any other communication channel. The images are at the beginning or at the end of the said information. If MFP has an external NIC connected with the said MFP and plugged into the main network, then the complete downloaded image passes through the Network Card, where the image is first recognized and simultaneously checked for the header and splitters.The mode of receiving the image data is through the network where TFTP, FTP or any other Client server protocols application is used to transfer the image to the MFP devices. When the image starts receiving the NIC checks if the image which is receiving is for the NIC or MFP through the file opcode. If MFP is detected first, then the split image is downloaded into MFP FLASH and the remaining part of the file is downloaded into NIC FLASH using a file exchange or data exchange protocols. If MFP has an external NIC which is not used and if the MFP is provided with a PSTN port, then the MFP communicates with an external server and if a valid upgradable image is recognized by MFP, then the file is downloaded into MFP. The MFP checks and validates whether the beginning of the image belongs to MFP firmware or NIC firmware and if the said image belongs to MFP then the image is FLASHEed on to<br><br>
MFP board first and then the NIC image gets transferred to NIC card via Shared Memory or via PCI bus. If MFP has an external Parallel/USB/Serial connection with a Host machine, it receives the downloadable image from the host device directly via USB/Serial or Parallel. If the Parallel/USB/Serial communication happens with the MFP board then MFP always checks for the firmware whether to download/upgrade to MFP upgrade to NIC or MFP boards. If the MFP is having external NIC then the User uses the web browsers to access the MFP device/Printer devices. A user interface provides the user to select the IMAGE which is to be upgraded to the MFP/NIC device. The user interface provides the user the option to select whether to download or upgrade the MFP firmware or only the NIC firmware or both. If the user selects the proper image and the option for downloading the firmware, the image gets transferred to the MFP/Printer device via the IP network where a client/server protocol transfers the image from one end to another. When the image gets transferred to the NIC, the NIC starts validating the image information provided in the Header section of the image. If the header specifies that the image is for NIC board, then the NIC first FLASH the NIC board or else identifies to which board the said image belongs and transfers the image data to the other board via Shared Memory or the PCI. If parallel port and associated driver are not available, the image is downloaded from the network to MFP via NIC. If only PSTN port is available which is connected to an integrated FAX modem, then the file is downloaded through PSTN network using an external server and if the size of the file is large then the normal network is used. If only an RS232 port is available, then the status of MFP/ printer is checked and the file is downloaded through NIC.<br><br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be<br><br>
embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
Figure 1 shows the communication mechanism between MFP main board and the NIC cards. The communication mechanism used is Shared Memory/PCI. It further illustrates the internal architecture of the MFP and the NIC boards. These boards are running on different CPU, Memory and other related resources. These cards are interfaced with the Shared memory or using the PCI architecture. This is used for the communication between the 2 boards. The network card is connected to the LAN or Internet via the LAN chip. The MFP board is connected to the PSTN network through the modem.<br>
Referring to figure 2 it shows the downloading of the multiple images to the target Printers or MFP devices. Using the browser like Netscape or IE we can select one image to configure both MFP and the NIC. In this invention basically 4 ways of communication models are identified,<br>
1.	Web based: Downloading the image using the web browser via internet or Intranet.<br>
2.	Stand alone: Downloading the image using the stand alone machine using the parallel or serial ports.<br><br>
3.	Using TFTP Server: Downloading the image using the TFTP or FTP server mechanism.<br>
4.	Using PSTN Line: Downloading using the PSTN line using the T30 communication Channel.<br>
The figure 3a and 3b shows the File Structure which is used in this invention. The images are separated by the known File Op-code wherein we can separate the files during parsing of the files. Traditionally there will be 2 images one for MFP and another for NIC. But if someone wants to upgrade the software for both the images one has to perform twice burning the images by selecting the different images available locally or in the internet. The figure 3a shows how 2 images are merged into one image so that they can be downloaded on to the MFP and NIC by performing once the download.<br>
Referring to Figure 3b it shows the File Structure which is used in this invention The details of the same are as follows:<br>
1.	Whenever the 2 or more images are merged first the image information will be stored as Header information.<br>
2.	The header information will contains the File/Image Op-code which indicates which particular image has been in the beginning of the file. File type field indicated what the type of the executable image.<br>
3.	Initial bytes will be present to make sure that the executable images for the particular type of ROM images. So that the MFP device can continue downloading the images on to the Flash.<br><br>
4.	Check sum is added in order to make sure that there won't be any loss or any change in the data during the transmission over internet or using the PSTN or any other communication channel.<br>
5.	The rest of the data is the actual image data which has to be programmed on to the FLASH.<br>
6.	The images can be in the beginning or at the end this doesn't make any difference during upgrading of the images on to respective flash memory.<br>
How the NIC or MFP will receive these images:-<br>
Method 1: If MFP is having an External NIC connected with it and plugged into the main network, then the complete Image will pass through the Network Card, wherein the image is first recognized and simultaneously checks for the header and splitters. Here the mode of receiving the image data is through the network. The different applications which are used for this purpose are TFTP, FTP or any other Client server protocols are used to transfer the image from user PC to the MFP devices. Refer to figure 4.<br>
Whenever the image is started receiving the NIC is going to check first whether the image which is receiving is for the NIC or MFP through the file opcode. If MFP is detected first, then the split image is downloaded into MFP FLASH and the remaining part of the file is downloaded into NIC FLASH. This can be achieved using any of the file exchange or data exchange protocols. For ex: using HTTP where in web browser can directly upgrade the image, the HTTP server residing on<br><br>
MFP receives the data and upgrades the NIC and MFP images. Another same example is TFTP or FTP server.<br>
Method 2: If MFP has an external NIC which is not used and if the MFP is provided with a PSTN port, then the MFP communicates with an external Server. If valid up gradable image is recognized by MFP, the file is downloaded into MFP. Here MFP is going to check and validate whether the beginning of the image belongs to MFP firmware or NIC firmware. If it belongs to MFP then the image will be FLASHEed on to MFP board first then the NIC firmware/image will be transferred to NIC card via Shared Memory or via PCI bus.<br>
Method 3: If MFP has an external Parallel/USB/Serial connection with the Host machine, it can receive the downloadable image from the host device directly via USB/Serial or Parallel. In this case if the Parallel/USB/Serial communication is happening with the MFP boards then MFP will always checks for the firmware whether the Firmware to be upgraded is for MFP board or NIC. If it's for NIC then the firmware image will be sent to the NIC card for upgrade. Otherwise the MFP firmware will be upgraded with the image received.<br>
OPERATION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Method 1: When the MFP is equipped with external NIC which is connected across network, then the complete single image is downloaded from the network. The valid image is recognized and as per header and splitters if MFP is recognized first, then part of the image is FLASHed into MFP and the remaining part is FLASHed into NIC.<br><br>
Here the operation from the end point of user is as follows:<br>
1.	The User uses the web browsers to access the MFP device/Printer devices.<br>
2.	The user interface will provide the user to select the IMAGE which is to be upgraded to the MFP/NIC device.<br>
3.	The user interface will also provide the user to select whether to download or upgrade the MFP firmware or only the NIC firmware. User can select both NIC and MFP boards also.<br>
4.	Once user selects the proper image and the option of download the firmware, the image will be transferred to the MFP/Printer device via the IP network. Any client/server protocol mechanisms can be used in order to transfer the image from one end to another.<br>
5.	Once the image has been transferred to the NIC, the NIC will start validating the image information provided in the Header section of the image.<br>
6.	If the header specifies that the image is for NIC board, then the NIC will first FLASH the NIC board otherwise identifies to which board it belongs and transfers the image data to the other board via Shared Memory or the PCI.<br>
Method 2: When MFP is equipped with NIC which is not connected to the network, and is provided with a PSTN port, then the MFP communicates with an external Server. The valid single image is downloaded and if the MFP is recognized first, then the part of the image is FLASHed into MFP and then the remaining part is<br><br>
FLASHed into NIC<br>
As per the scheme explained above, the firmware images can be upgraded through downloading of a single image either through PSTN network or through parallel port. Serial port and network can be used for status checking and then downloading.<br>
1.	In a situation wherein parallel port and associated driver is not available, the image can be downloaded from the network to MFP via NIC.<br>
2.	In a situation wherein only PSTN port is available and which can be connected to an integrated FAX modem, then the file can be downloaded through PSTN network with the help of external server as long as the file size is not very large. If the file size is large, then normal network is used.<br>
3.	In a situation wherein only an RS232 port is available, then the status of MFP/ printer is checked and then the file is downloaded through NIC<br>
4.	Once the image is start receiving on to the MFP device then identifying the image header information and deciding whether to upgrade which board to upgrade with the firmware will be decided, (these are same as explained in above sections)<br>
The above-presented description is of the best mode contemplated for carrying out the present invention. The manner and process of making and using it is in such a full, clear, concise and exact terms as to enable to any person skilled in the art to which it pertains to make and use this invention. New embodiments in particular, which also lie within the scope of the invention can be created, in which different<br><br>
details of the different examples can in a purposeful way be combined with one another.<br>
