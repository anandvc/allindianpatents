The present invention relates to a lock slider for a slide<br>
fastener, and more particularly to a lock slider composed of a pull tab with locking pawls, and a slider body, which are simultaneously molded in an assembled form, 2. Description of the Related Art:<br>
As shown In FIG. 10 of the accompanying drawings, Japanese Utility Model Publication No. Sho 51-4809 discloses a conventional lock slider, for a slide fastener, in which a slider body has centrally in its upper surface a rearwardly opening pull-tab-receiving groove 12' in which a pull tab 2' is to be received in such a manner that the upper surface of the pull tab 2' is flush with the upper surface of the slider body 1'. For assembly, a pair of lateral pivots 22' of the pull tab 2' are received in a pull-tab-holding groove 14 disposed at opposite walls of the pull-tab-receiving groove 12' from a rear end to a center posi¬tion of the slider body 1', whereupon confronting edges 11' at the pull-tab-holding groove 14 is bent down¬wardly to prevent the pivots 22' from removing from<br><br>
the pull-tab-holding groove 14', in such a manner that the pull tab* 2' can be received in the pull-tab-receiving groove 12'.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 11 and 12, U.S. Pat. No. 2, 495,539 discloses a lock slider, for a slide fastener, in which a slider body 1" and a pull tab 2" having a locking pawl are simultaneously molded in an assembled form.<br>
In the slider disclosed in this U.S. Patent, an upper wing 3" of'the slider body 1" has a cutout 15" extending from one side edge to a central pull-tab-attaching lug 11" so that the locking pawl 23" of the pull tab 2" can be inserted. The pull-tab-attaching lug 11" has a pair of lateral projectiona 14 on which a pair of attaching rings 22" of the pull tab 2" are threaded.<br>
According to the lock slider of the firat-named publication, the slider body 1' and the pull lab 2' are molded individually, and then they arc. assembled to complete the slider, which is laborious and time-consuming. Therefore it is impossible to improve the rate of production. Further, if the pull tab 2' is inverted, the pull tab 2' and a locking pawl 23' would project on the slider body 1' to catch and damage a garment or something around.<br><br>
According to the lock slider QE the second-named publication, the cutout of the upper Wing 3" is formed by inserting into the mold a side core having a thickness equal to that of the upper wing 3" during molding. Therefore the cutout 15" of the upper wing 3" is devoid of anything, at a flange side, for guiding the fastener elements, namely, for protecting the corners of the fastener elements. In addition, since the front and rear walls of the cutout 15" of the upper wing 3" have acute edges, the upper surfaces of the fastener elements, especially braids or sewing threads, would tend to be damaged due to the movement of the slider.<br>
Further, partly since one end of the cutout 15" is larger in width than the locking pawl 23", and partly since the front end of the slider body 1*' is larger in width than the rear end as a shape of the Upper wing 3", smooth guiding of the fastener elements Could not be achieved. And since the attaching riags 22 of the pull tab 2" are threaded on the respective lateral projec¬tions 14" of the pull-tab-attaching tug 11", stable attachment of the pull tab 2" could not be  achieved. Still further, since there is only a side flange 6" bridging upper wing portions about the cutout 15", adequate toughness of the slider is difficult to<br><br>
achieve.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Preferred embodiments of the lock slider for slide fastener, according to this invention will now be des¬cribed in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 5 and 6, a lock slider of this invention is to be threaded on a fastener chain of the type having a pair of rows of continuous fastener elements E each in the form of a zigzag-shaped mono¬filament, which is mounted astride a fastener tape T along its inner longitudinal edge by braids B and sew¬ing threads S, or of the type having a pair of rows of discrete fastener elements, which are Itioiuited astride a pair of fastener tapes along their inner longitudinal edges as by molding or clenching.<br>
Alternatively, the lock slider may be used for a fastener chain of the type having a pair of rows of coiled or zigzag-shaped fastener elements each mounted on one surface of a fastener tape.<br><br>
The lock slider according to this invention, as shown in FIGS. 1 through 4, generally comprises a slider body 1 and a pull tab 2. The slider body 1 is composed of upper and lower wings 3, 4 joined at their front ends by a guide post 5 and having upper and lower pairs of opposite side flanges 6, 7, each pair along opposite side edges of the respective wing 3, 4, defining a Y-shaped guide channel 8 having a front end mouth 9 at the guide post side and a rear end mouth 10.<br>
The upper wing 3 has on its upper surface at opposite side edges thereof a pair of lugs 11 project¬ing opposite to and contiguous to the Bide, flanges 6 to define a longitudinal central receas 12  with paral¬lel inner walls. Each lug 11 has a horizontal slot 13 extending between its center to the rear and mouth 10 and having a bottom surface lower than the  bottom surface of the central recess 12. Each lug 11   further has a pivot insertion hole 14 extending upwardly from and communicating with the horizontal slot 13 at a position toward its front end, i.e. toward the front  , end mouth 9, with a height equal to its dlameter. Alter¬natively the pivot insertion hole 14 may be communi¬cated with the horizontal slot 13 by a  reduced-width neck portion.<br><br>
Further, the upper wing 3 has, in the central recess 12 between the lugs 11, a pair of longitudinal locking-pawl insertion holes- 15, a pair of  flat holding portions 16 disposed the outer shies of the two locking-pawl insertion holes 15, and a central bridging plate 17 disposed between the two lacking-pawl Insertion holes 15. The holding portion   16 and the bridging plate 17 jointly serve to hold the fas¬tener elements E on their upper side which the fas¬tener elements E are guided in the guide channel 8. The bridging plate 17 has centrally on lis lower sur¬face an upper longitudinal ridge 18 with a  round peak, and the lower wing 4  has centrally on its upper sur¬face a lower longitudinal ridge 19 with a round peak. The upper and lower longitudinal rldges 18, 19 are disposed in a confronting relationship to guide the braids B attaching the fastener elements E to the fastener tape T.<br>
Further, the bottom surface of the recess 12 of the upper wing 3 is divided, by a transverse border line disposed adjacent to and rearwardly of the lock¬ing-pawl insertion holes 14, into a front section 20 low in level and disposed toward the guide post 5, namely, the front end mouth 9, and a rear section 21 high in level and disposed toward the rear end mouth<br><br>
The pull tab 2 is in the form of a roctangular plate slightly enlarged in width at one end temote from its base, having a pair of triangular locking pawls 23 projecting from one surface of the base for insertion through the respective locking-pawl inser¬tion holes 15. The two triangular locking pawls 23 are laterally spaced parallel to each other with their peaks longitudinally staggered. The pull tab 2 has near the locking pawls 23 a central projection 24 to contact with the bottom surface of the recess 12 at the rear section 21. Further, the pull tab 2 has a pair of lateral pivots 22 projecting in opposite directions from opposite sides of the base at posi¬tions slightly toward the surface on which the lock¬ing pawls 23 stand. The pivots 22 are rotatably received in the respective pivot insertion holes lA so that the pull tab 2 is pivotable about the pivots 22.<br>
Alternatively, the pivots 22 of the pull tab 2 may be disposed toward the surface opposite to the surface on which the locking pawls 23 stand, as shown in FIG. 7. In another alternative form, the pivots 22 may project respective centers of opposite hide sur¬faces of the pull tab 2. Further, each pivot 22 of the<br><br>
pull tab 2 may be freely moved between the correspond¬ing pivot insertion hole lA and the corresponding horizontal slot 13; in this case, the height of the pivot insertion hole lA must be set to be larger than a height of the horizontal slot 13.<br>
During the sliding movement of the slider, as shown in FIG. 6, the braids B and the sewing threads S covering the fastener elements E can be guided by the bridging plate 17, the holding j)ortions 16 and the flanges 6 without being damaged by the locking pawl holes 15.<br>
In operation, assuming that the slider is to be locked in an arbitrary position on the fastener chain as shown in FIG. 5, the pull tab 2 is placed flat on the upper wing 3 to bring the central pro¬jection 2A into contact with the rear section 21 of the bottom surface of the recess 12 and also to bring the locking pawis 23 into the spaces between the fas¬tener elements E. As a result, the slider is prevented from moving along the fastener element rows, For unlco ing the slider, the pull tab 2 is brought upright and pulled toward the front end mouth 9 .SO that the lock¬ing pawls 23 are released from the spaced between the fastener elements E to free the slider for movement along the fastener element rows. When It la placed<br><br>
against on the upper wing 3, the pull tab 2 is in contact with the lower or front section 20 of the bottom surface of the recess 12 to assume a horizontal posture.<br>
In production, as shown In FIGS. 8 at|d 9, the front, rear, upper and lower cores far molding the slider body 1 and the pull tab 2 of the slider are moved into the mold, while the right and left side cores 25 for molding the pivot insertion holes 14 of the slider body 1, the pivots 22 of the pull tab and the horizontal slots 13 are moved into the mold. At that time, the side cores 25 are inset-ted through the upper wing 3 and the lugs 11 so as to come Into con¬tact with the upper surface of the rear core 26 inserted _into the slider body 1 from the rear end mouth 10. The rear core 26 has on its upper surface a pair of projections 27 for molding the locking-pawl insertion holes 15. As the projections 27 are brought in surface-to-surface contact with the opposlte side cores 25, the locking-pawl insertion holes 15, the horizontal slots 13 and the pivot insertion holes 14 are molded so as to communicate with one another on each side. The mold is assembled using these cores, whereupon molding material is poured into the  mold by injection to mold the slider body 1 and the  pull tab :<br><br>
2 simultaneously in an assembled forn<br>
The lock slider of this invention has the following advantageous results:<br>
According to the first aspect of the invention, partly since the locking-pawl insertion holes 15 of the upper wing 3 communicate with the corresponding hori¬zontal slots 13 of the lugs 11, the pivot insertion holes l4 being formed above the respective horizontal slots 13 so as to communicate with them respectively, and the locking pawls 23 being aligned with the locking-pawl insertion holes 15, and partly since the slider body 1 and the pull tab 2 are simultaneously molded in an assembled form in such a manner that the pivots 22 of the pull tab 2 are inset ted in the res¬pective pivot insertion holes, it is possible to manu¬facture, in a simple molding process, a lock slider which is a thin type neat in appearance and can secure an excellent locking feature, thus increasing a rate of the productivity.<br>
According to a second aspect of the Invention, since the upper wing 3 has, for guiding a pair of fastener element rows E of the slide fasteter , a pair of molded holding portions 16 each extnding between the respective flanges 6, 7 and the respective locking-pawl insertion holes 6, and a molded tridging plate<br><br>
17 extending between the locking-pawl inaertion holes 15, the slider has a unique form suitable for molding, enables to protect and guide fastener elements E reliably, and secures an adequate locking feature.<br>
According to a third aspect of the invention, since the upper surface of the upper wing 3 is divided, by a transverse border line disposed adjacent to and rearwardly of the locking-pawl insertion holes 15, into a front section 20 low in level and a rear section 21 high in level, it is possible to reduce the slider in t.hickness and to shorten the locking pawls 23, thus giving no damage to something around.<br>
According to a fourth aspect of the invention, since each of the pivot insertion holes 15 extends perpendicularly to the respective horizontal slot 13 by a uniform width, the pivots 22 of the pull tab 2 can be shifted from the pivot insertion holes l4 to the horizontal slot 13 so that the pull tab 2 can remain a horizontal posture when the slider is locked, giving no damage to something around.<br>
According to a fifth aspect of the invention, since the pull tab 2 has on the one surface, from which the locking pawls 23 project, a central pro¬jection 24 touchable with the upper surfacte of the upper wing 3, it is possible to keep the pull tab 2<br><br>
from intimate contact vith the slider  body  l ,  faci litating handling the pull tab 2.<br>
According to a sixth aspect of the invention, since the pivots 22 of the pull tab 2 are disposed off the one surface thereof, from which the locking pawls 23 project, toward the other surface, it is possible to accommodate the pull tab 2 in a low posi¬tion as retracted in the slider body 1, making the slider smaller in thickness and neat in appearance.<br><br><br>
