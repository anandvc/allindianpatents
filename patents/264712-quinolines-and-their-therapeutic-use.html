				<td>QUINOLINES AND THEIR THERAPEUTIC USE<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a class of quinoline compounds which are ligands of the CRTH2 receptor (Chemoattractant Receptor-homologous molecule expressed on T Helper cells type 2), and their use in the treatment of diseases responsive to modulation of CRTH2 receptor activity, principally diseases having a significant inflammatory component. The invention also relates to novel members of that class of ligands and pharmaceutical compositions containing them.<br>
Background to the Invention<br>
Mast cells are known to play an important role in allergic and immune responses through the release of a number of mediators, such as histamine, leukotrienes, cytokines, prostaglandin D2, etc (Boyce; Allergy Asthma Proa, 2004, 25, 27-30). Prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) is the major metabolite produced by the action of cyclooxygenase on arachadonic acid by mast cells in response to allergen challenge (Lewis et al; J. Immunol., 1982, 129, 1627-1631). It has been shown that PGD2 production is increased in patients with systemic mastocytosis (Roberts; N. Engl. J. Med., 1980, 303, 1400-1404), allergic rhinitis (Naclerio et al; Am. Rev. Respir. Dis., 1983,128, 597-602; Brown et al; Arch. Otolarynol. Head Neck Surg., 1987,113,179-183; Lebel et al; J. Allergy Clin. Immunol., 1988, 82, 869-877), bronchial asthma (Murray et al; N. Engl. J. Med., 1986, 315, 800-804; Liu et al; Am. Rev. Respir. Dis., 1990.142,126-132; Wenzel et al; J. Allergy Clin. Immunol., 1991, 87, 540-548), and urticaria (Heavey et al; J. Allergy Clin. Immunol., 1986, 78, 458-461). PGD2 mediates it effects-through two receptors, the PGD2 (or DP) receptor (Boie et al; J. Biol. Chem., 1995, 270, 18910-18916) and the chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on Th2 (or CRTH2) (Nagata et al; J. Immunol., 1999, 162, 1278-1289; Powell; Prostaglandins Luekot. Essent. Fatty Acids, 2003, 69,179-185). Therefore, it has been postulated that agents that antagonise the effects of PGD2 at its receptors may have beneficial effects in number of disease states.<br>
The CRTH2 receptor has been shown to be expressed on cell types associated with allergic inflammation, such as basophils, eosinophils, and Th2-type immune helper cells (Hirai et al; J. Exp. Med., 2001, 193, 255-261). The CRTH2 receptor has been shown to mediate PGD2-mediated ceil migration in these cell types (Hirai et al; J. Exp. Med., 2001, 193, 255-261), and also to play a major role in neutrophil and eosinophil cell recruitment in a model of contact dermatitis (Takeshita et al; Int. Immunol.,   2004,   16,   947-959).   Ramatroban  {(3R)-3-[(4-fluorophenyl)sulphonyl-<br>
amino]-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-9H-carbazole-9-propanoic acid}, a dual CRTH2 and thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist, has been shown to attenuate these responses (Sugimoto et al; J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 2003, 305, 347-352; Takeshita et al; op. cit.). The potential of PGD2 both to enhance allergic inflammation and induce an inflammatory response has been demonstrated in mice and rats. Transgenic mice over expressing PGD2 synthase exhibit an enhanced pulmonary eosinophilia and increased levels of Th2 cytokines in response to allergen challenge (Fujitani et al; J. Immunol., 2002, 168, 443-449). In addition, exogenously administered CRTH2 agonists enhance the allergic response in sensitised mice (Spik et al; J. Immunol., 2005, 174, 3703-3708). In rats exogenously applied CRTH2 agonists cause a pulmonary eosinophilia but a DP agonist (BW 245C) or a TP agonist (l-BOP) showed no effect (Shirashi et al; J. Pharmacol. Exp Ther., 2005, 312, 954-960). These observations suggest that CRTH2 antagonists may have valuable properties for the treatment of diseases mediated by PGD2.<br>
In addition to Ramatroban a number of other CRTH2 antagonists have been<br>
described. Examples include: indoleacetic acids (WO2007/065684; WO2007/045867;<br>
WO2006/034419; WO2005/094816; WO2005/044260; WO2005/040114;<br>

The quinoline template is a common one in compounds proposed for use as pharmaceuticals. However the compounds with which the present invention is concerned have a substitution pattern on the quinoline template which distinguishes them from specific known quinoline-type pharmaceuticals or known generally proposed classes of quinoline-type pharmaceuticals.<br>

Biological Methods<br>
Compounds of the invention of formula (I) were tested using the following biological test methods to determine their ability to displace PGD2 from the CRTH2 receptor<br><br>
and for their ability to antagonise the functional effects of PGD2 at the CRTH2 receptor in a whole cell system.<br>
Radioligand Binding Assay<br>
The receptor binding assay is performed in a final volume of 200 uL binding buffer [10 mM BES (pH 7.4), 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM manganese chloride, 0.01 % BSA] and 1 nM [3H]-PGD2 (Amersham Biosciences UK Ltd). Ligands are added in assay buffer containing a constant amount of DMSO (1 % by volume). Total binding is determined using 1 % by volume of DMSO in assay buffer and non-specific binding is determined using 10 uM of unlabeled PGD2 (Sigma). Human embryonic kidney (HEK) cell membranes (3.5 ug) expressing the CRTH2 receptor are incubated with 1.5 mg wheatgerm agglutinin SPA beads and 1 nM [3H]-PGD2 (Amersham Biosciences UK Ltd) and the mixture incubated for 3 hours at room temperature. Bound [3H]-PGD2 is detected using a Microbeta TRILUX liquid scintillation counter (Perkin Elmer). Compound IC50 value is determined using a 6-point dose response curve in duplicate with a semi-log compound dilution series. IC50 calculations are performed using Excel and XLfit (Microsoft), and this value is used to determine a Ki value for the test compound using the Cheng-Prusoff equation.<br>
GTPS Assay<br>
The GTPyS Assay is performed in a final volume of 200 mL assay buffer (20mM HEPES pH 7.4, 10mM MgCI2, 100mM NaCI, 10µg/mL saponin). DMSO concentrations are kept constant at 1% by volume. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) cell membranes (3.5 ug) expressing the CRTH2 receptor are incubated with the compounds for 15 min at 30° C prior to addition of PGD2 (30nM final concentration) and GTP (10µM final concentration). The assay solutions are then incubated for 30 minutes at 30° C, followed by addition of [35S]-GTPS (0.1 nM final concentration). The assay plate is than shaken and incubated for 5 minutes at 30°C. Finally, SPA beads (Amersham Biosciences, UK) are added to a final concentration of 1.5mg/well and the plate shaken and incubated for 30 minute at 30° C. The sealed plate is centrifuged at 1000g for 10mins at 30oC and the bound [35S]-GTPS is detected on Microbeta scintillation counter (Perkin Elmer). Compound IC50 value is determined using a 6-point dose response curve in duplicate with a semi-log compound dilution series. IC50 calculations are performed using Excel and XLfit (Microsoft), and this value is used to determine a Ki value for the test compound using the Cheng-Prusoff equation.<br><br>
Biological Results:<br>
Compounds of the Examples above were tested in the CRTH2 radioligand binding and GTPyS functional assays described above; the compounds all have IC50 values of less than 1 µM in both assays. For example, the compound of Example 1 had an IC50 value of 5.4 nM in the CRTH2 radioligand binding assay, and the compound of Example 2 had an IC50 value of 6.3 nM in that assay.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
