CODEWORD PERMUTATION AND REDUCED FEEDBACK FOR GROUPED<br>
ANTENNAS<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]	This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent application<br>
Serial No. 60/842,872 entitled "A METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CODEWORD PERMUTATION AND REDUCED FEEDBACK FOR GROUPED ANTENNAS" which was filed September 6,2006. The entirety of the aforementioned application is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
I.	Field<br>
[0002]	The following description relates generally to wireless communications,<br>
and more particularly to codeword permutation for grouped antennas in a wireless communication system.<br>
II.	Background<br>
[0003]	Wireless communication systems are widely deployed to provide various<br>
types of communication content such as, for example, voice, data, and so on. Typical<br>
wireless communication systems may be multiple-access systems capable of supporting<br>
communication with multiple users by sharing available system resources (e.g.,<br>
bandwidth, transmit power,...). Examples of such multiple-access systems may<br>
include code division multiple access (CDMA) systems, time division multiple access<br>
(TDMA) systems, frequency division multiple access (FDMA) systems, orthogonal<br>
frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems, and the like.<br>
[0004]	Generally, wireless multiple-access communication systems may<br>
simultaneously suppport communication for multiple mobile devices. Each mobile device may communicate with one or more base stations via transmissions on forward and reverse links. The forward link (or downlink) refers to the communication link from base stations to mobile devices, and the reverse link (or uplink) refers to the communication link from mobile devices to base stations. Further, communications between mobile devices and base stations may be established via single-input single-<br><br>
output (SISO) systems, multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, and so forth.<br>
[0005)	MIMO systems commonly employ multiple (NT) transmit antennas and<br>
multiple (NR) receive antennas for data transmission. A MIMO channel formed by the NT transmit and A'^ receive antennas may be decomposed into Ns independent channels, which may be referred to as spatial channels, where   Each of the Ns<br>
independent channels corresponds to a dimension. Moreover, MIMO systems may provide improved performance (e.g., increased spectral efficiency, higher throughput and/or greater reliability) if the additional dimensionalities created by the multiple transmit and received antennas are utilized.<br>
[0006]	MIMO systems may support various depleting techniques to divide<br>
forward and reverse link communications over a common physical medium. For instance, frequency division duplex (FDD) systems may utilize disparate frequency regions for forward and reverse link communications. Further, in time division duplex (TDD) systems, forward and reverse link communications may employ a common frequency region. However, conventional techniques may provide limited or no feedback related to channel information.<br>

feedback in a wireless communication system comprises unfixing permuted codeword<br><br>
blocks according to a permutation scheme employed during transmission, regenerating interference created by a first codeword during transmission, evaluating a channel quality indicator (CQI) related to the first codeword and evaluating a differential CQI related to quality increase resulting from canceling the regenerated interference in decoding a second codeword.<br>

[0033]	Referring now to Fig. 1, a wireless communication system 100 is<br>
illustrated in accordance with various embodiments presented herein. System 100 comprises a base station 102 that may include multiple antenna groups. For example, one antenna group may include antennas 104 and 106, another group may comprise antennas 108 and 110, and an additional group may include antennas 112 and 114. Two antennas are illustrated for each antenna group; however, more or fewer antennas may be utilized for each group. Base station 102 may additionally include a transmitter chain and a receiver chain, each of which can in turn comprise a plurality of components associated with signal transmission and reception (e.g., processors, modulators, multiplexers, demodulators, demultiplexers, antennas, etc.), as will be appreciated by one skilled in the art.<br>
[0034]	Base station 102 may communicate with one or more mobile devices<br>
such as mobile device 116 and mobile device 122; however, it is to be appreciated that base station 102 may communicate with substantially any number of mobile devices similar to mobile devices 116 and 122. Mobile devices 116 and 122 can be, for example, cellular phones, smart phones, laptops, handheld communication devices, handheld computing devices, satellite radios, global positioning systems, PDAs, and/or any other suitable device for communicating over wireless communication system 1 DO. As depicted, mobile device 116 is in communication with antennas 112 and 114, where antennas 112 and 114 transmit information to mobile device 116 over a forward link 118 and receive information from mobile device 116 over a reverse link 120. Moreover, mobile device 122 is in communication with antennas 104 and 106, where antennas 104 and 106 transmit information to mobile device 122 over a forward link 124 and receive information from mobile device 122 over a reverse link 126. In a frequency division duplex (FDD) system, forward link 118 may utilize a different frequency band than that used by reverse link 120, and forward link 124 may employ a different frequency band than that employed by reverse link 126, for example. Further,<br><br>
m a time division duplex (TDD) system, forward link 118 and reverse link 120 may utilize a common frequency band and forward link 124 and reverse link 126 may utilize a common frequency band.<br>
(0035]	The set of antennas and/or the area in which they are designated to<br>
communicate may be referred to as a sector of base station 102. For example, multiple antennas may be designed to communicate to mobile devices in a sector of the areas covered by base station 102. In communication over forward links 118 and 124, the fransmitting antennas of base station 102 may utilize beamforming to improve signal-to-noise ratio of forward Imks 118 and 124 for mobile devices 116 and 122. Also, while base station 102 utilizes beamforming to transmit to mobile devices 116 and 122 scattered randomly through an associated coverage, mobile devices in neighboring cells may be subject to less interference as compared to a base station transmitting through a single antenna to all its mobile devices.<br>
[0036]	According to an example, system 100 may be a multiple-input multiple-<br>
output (MIMO) communication system. Further, system 100 may utilize any type of duplexmg technique to divide communication channels {e.g., forward link, reverse link, ...) such as FDD, TDD, and the like. Moreover, system 100 may employ codeword permutation to reduce amount of feedback required to improve subsequent transmissions and increase spatial diversity for each codeword. Pursuant to an illustration, base station 102 may transmit over forward links 118 and 124 to mobile devices 116 and 122. Base station 102 may mix codewords between antennas groups and/or layers based upon a number of active antennas in the MIMO communication system and the level of correspondence between codewords and layers. Base station 102 transmits codewords over forward links 118and 124 in permuted form so that each codewords transmits in part on all selected antennas in the MIMO communication system. Mobile devices 116 and 122 receive the permuted transmission from base station 102 v/a respective forward links 118 and 124. Mobile devices 116 and 122 are aware of the permutation scheme employed by base station 102. Accordingly, mobile device 116 and 122 can unmix and reconstruct the original codewords after receiving permuted codewords through respective forward links 118 and 124. In addition, mobile devices 116 and 122 may determine feedback to be provided to base station 102 related to the permuted transmission. For example, mobile devices 116 and 122 may utilize a<br><br>
condensed feedback metric as opposed to providing separate values for each individual channel, antenna, codeword or the like. According to an illustration, a single quality value accurately representative of all forward link channels may be transmitted from one of the mobile devices 116 and 122 to base station 102; however, the claimed subject matter is no so limited. The feedback may be transmitted over a reverse link charmel to base station 102.<br>
|0037]	Base station 102 may obtain channel related feedback from mobile<br>
devices 116 and 122. Further, base station 102 may utilize the feedback to adjust subsequent transmissions to mobile devices 116 and 112. According to an example, base station 102 transmits multiple output streams to mobile device 116 in a MIMO environment according to a permutation of the output stteams (i.e., mixing the output streams among the output antennas). The multiple output streams, when permuted, experience substantially similar conditions, on average, during transmission to enable providing simplified feedback relating to all output streams from mobile device 116 to base station 102; likewise, base station 102 and mobile device 122 may employ permutations m a substantially similar manner. Further, mobile devices 116 and 122 may employ interference cancellation techniques. Base station 102 may utilize the simplified feedback (e.g., composed of an average channel quality indicator and one or more incremental charmel quality indicators) to adjust subsequent transmissions for all output streams over the forward link channel.<br>
[0038)	Tuming to Fig. 2, illustrated is a communications apparatus 200 for<br>
employment within a wireless communications environment. Communications apparatus 200 may be a base station or a portion thereof or a mobile device or a portion thereof According to an illustration, communication apparatus 200 can be employed in a MIMO system where multiple antennas are employed to transmit and receive data transmission. The antennas can be physical or virtual antennas. A physical antenna is an antenna employed to radiate a signal and typically has a limited maximum transmit power. A virtual anterma is an antenna through which data can be transmitted but the virtual anterma does not necessarily radiate a signal. According to one example, a virtual antenna can be associated with a beam formed by combining multiple physical antennas through a vector of coefficients. Multiple virtual antennas are possible by<br><br>
associating each vutual antenna to some or all physical antennas through various mapping techniques.<br>
[0039]	Communication apparatus 200 is applicable to multi-codeword MIMO<br>
systems. One multi-codeword MIMO scheme is Per Antenna Rate Control (PARC) or<br>
Selective Per Antenna Rate Control (SPARC). In a (S)PARC scheme, one codeword<br>
corresponds to one layer of a MIMO system. A layer can be a data stream, a physical<br>
antenna, a virtual antenna or the like. Accordingly, m the (S)PARC scheme, each<br>
physical and/or virtual antenna transmits and/or receives a separate data stream<br>
simultaneously. Each data stream can be encoded at varying data rates based upon,<br>
among other things, interference experienced by a channel conveying the data stream.<br>
Higher throughput is achieved by employing multiple transmit antennas and multiple<br>
receiver antennas to create a plurality of channels that can be spatially distinguished.<br>
One difficulty presented by MIMO systems is maximizing throughput for each channel<br>
and minimizing amount of feedback required to achieve maximization. For example, a<br>
channel quality indicator (CQI) is fed back for each channel so that the transmitter can<br>
maximize throughput by adjusting data rates on all channels. It is to be appreciated that<br>
a CQI can include a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), a signal-to-interference plus noise ratio<br>
(SINR), or other such metrics and/or a value computed from such measured quantities.<br>
This feedback based througput maximization approach consumes a large amount of<br>
uplmk or reverse link resources in providing a CQI for each of the multiple channels.<br>
(0040]	Communications apparatus 200 can include a permuter 202 that<br>
permutes data streams over a plurality of antennas. In a (S)PARC scheme, permuter 202 can perform layer permutations such that each data stream is fransmitted in part via all or a selected subset of physical and/or virtual antennas. For example, a MIMO system can have four physical antennas and transmit a separate data stream on each of the four antennas. Permuter 202 permutes frames of the data streams so that portions of any given data stream transmit on all four antennas. Beforehand, the data streams are conventionally encoded, interleaved and mapped to modulation symbols. However, prior to transmission by the transmit antermas, the modulation symbols are mixed according to a cycling or pseudo-random pattern by permuter 202. By way of illustration and not limitation, a first block of each data stream is transmitted via a first combination of MIMO channels. For example, four data streams numbered 1 through 4<br><br>
are to be transmitted over four MIMO channels numbered 1 through 4. The first block of data streams 1 through 4 can be transmitted by MIMO channels 1 through 4 respectively. Then, a second block of the data streams 1 through 4 can be transmitted by MIMO channels 2, 3, 4 and I respectively. The third blocks can be transmitted by channels 3, 4,1 and 2, respectively. The remaining blocks can be transmitted in this manner by cycling through each of the four simple cycling permutations or the fiill 24 possible permutations of MIMO channels 1 through 4. If only two or three streams are transmitted, the cycling or pseudo-random permutations can be applied to only the selected subset of physical and/or virtual antennas. Each block may correspond to each subcarrier or group of subcarriers in the frequency-domain transmission (e.g., OFDMA). In addition, each block may correspond to each time-domain symbol or group of symbols in the time-domain transmission (e.g., single carrier FDMA, CDMA, etc.).<br>
[0041]	Permuting the data streams on a set of MIMO channels according to a<br>
fiill permutation of channel combinations enables a condensed metric to be utilized as<br>
feedback. The blocks of each data stream are transmitted over all MIMO channels.<br>
Accordingly, each of the data streams have experienced the same channel conditions on<br>
average provided that the channel remains nearly static during the transmission of the<br>
blocks of data stream for each period of permutation. The similar channel conditions<br>
results in similar CQIs (e.g., SNR, SINR or other such metric). For example, the<br>
respective SNRs for each of the data streams should be well behaved and only vary<br>
based upon any successive interference cancellation performed on the multiple data<br>
streams. The respective SNRs can be represented with reasonable accuracy by a<br>
condensed form more compact than providing separate SNR measurements for each<br>
MIMO channel. For example, the condensed form can include a reference SNR and a<br>
delta or differential SNR. The reference SNR can correspond to the SNR value of a first<br>
decoded data stream and the delta SNR value corresponds to the difference between<br>
successive data streams resulting from successive interference cancellation.<br>
[0042]	The transmitter of the permuted data streams receives the condensed<br>
SNR via the reverse link or uplink. The transmitter can employ the condensed SNR value to adjust the data rates with which to encode subsequent data streams. For example, the transmitter assumes the reference SNR included in the condensed SNR is<br><br>
equal to the SNR measured by the receiver for one data stream. The transmitter will<br>
utilize this SNR to adjust of the data rate of die matching data stream. For the second<br>
data stream, the transmitter assumes the measured SNR is equal to die sum of the<br>
reference SNR and the delta SNR and adjust the data rate accordingly. For the next data<br>
stream, the transmitter utilizes the sum of the reference SNR and two-times die delta<br>
SNR to adjust the data rate and so on for each date, stream thereafter.<br>
[0043]	On the receiver side, a corresponding communication apparatus shnilar<br>
to apparatus 200 receives the permuted data streams mixed by permuter 204. The receiver side communication apparatus can be a mobile device or portion thereof if communication apparatus 200 is a base station or a portion thereof. Conversely, if communication apparatus 200 is a mobile device or portion thereof, the receiver side apparatus can be a base station or portion thereof The receiver side apparatus includes reconstructor 204 that unmixes the permuted data streams transmitted. The reconstructor 204 is aware of the permutation scheme employed by permuter 202 to mix the data streams across the channels. The reconstructor 204 receives the blocks from each of the MIMO channels and reconstructs the original data streams. The reconstructed data streams are analyzed by a feedback evaluator 206 to determine the SNRs of the data streams or some other CQI values as described above. Alternatively, the MIMO channel estimates obtained via reference signals or pilot signals can be employed in conjunction with the permutation scheme to derive the SNRs or other CQI values.<br>
[0044]	Communication apparatus 200 can be employed in a variety of multi-<br>
codeword MIMO systems in addition to the {S)PARC scheme described above. For example, communication apparatus 200 is applicable to a Per Group Rate Control (PGRC) multi-codeword MIMO scheme.<br>
[0045]	Turning briefly to Fig. 3, illustrated is an exemplary wireless<br>
convmunication system 300 that implements a PGRC scheme. System 300 Includes two data streams (/. e., Data Stream 1 and Data Stream 2) and four transmit antennas 316-322. Thus, system 300 can be described as a 4x4 MIMO system. It is to be appreciated that additional antennas and data streams can be utilized to expand the MIMO system. Data Stream 1 is encoded at a first data rate by an encoder 302. In one example, encoder 302 partitions Data Stream 1 into binary blocks of a specified length and the<br><br>
blocks are mapped into a binary codeword. The codeword associated with Data Stream<br>
1 is interleaved by interleaver 304. Interleaving is a process by which block of a data<br>
stream are rearranged or reordered in a non-contiguous manner so as to improve<br>
performance. Mapper 306 receives the interleaved stream and maps it to modulation<br>
symbols to be transmitted via the antennas. Encoder 308, interleaver 310 and mapper<br>
312 perform a similar operation with respect to Data Stream 2.<br>
[0046]	Following the processing of the data streams, a grouping circuit 314<br>
distributes the encoded data streams between the plur^ity of antennas 316-322. In one<br>
possible distribution, antenna 316 can transmit a first pwrtion of encoded data stream 1<br>
and antenna 318 can transmit a second portion of encoded data stream 1. Accordingly,<br>
antermas 320 and 322 transmit a first and second portion of encoded data stream 2<br>
respectively. It is to be appreciated that a variety of other groupings can be employed.<br>
For example, grouping circuit 314 can allocate antennas 316 and 320 for encoded data<br>
stream 1 and antermas 318 and 322 for encoded data stream 2. In the exemplary system<br>
depicted in Fig. 3 with two data streams and four antermas, grouping circuit 314 can<br>
choose among six possible combinations. Depending on the reported channel rank, only<br>
a part of the antennas are selected and utilized for data transmission. For example, only<br>
the antennas 316, 318, and 320 may be used to transmit two data streams. In this case.<br>
Data Stream 1 may be transmitted through the antenna 316 and Data Stream 2 may be<br>
transmitted throughthe antennas 318 and 320. It is to be appreciated that the antennas<br>
316-322 may be either physical antennas and/or virtual antennas.<br>
[0047]	Referring back to Fig, 2, the permutation and differential feedback<br>
concepts, described above with reference to the (S)PARC scheme, can be applied to the PGRC muhi-codeword scheme. In the (S)PARC scheme, one codeword corresponds to one layer (e.g., data stream, physical antenna, virtual antenna...). In the PGRC scheme described with respect to Fig. 3, one codeword corresponds to one or two layers. In other words, one encoded data stream can be transmitted on one or two antennas. Permuting on the layer level may not achieve the desired performance increases in some cases because a codeword can correspond to two physical or virtual antennas. Many layer combinations result in an effectively identical arrangement as tiie original. The only difference being the codeword portions associated with a particular group of two antennas are swapped. In other words, if a first portion of a codeword is to be<br><br>
transmitted on a first antenna and a second portion a codeword on a second antenna, one<br>
possible layer permutation merely results in the first portion being transmitted on the<br>
second antenna and the second portion on the first antenna. Accordingly, in a PGRC<br>
scheme, permutation should ideally occur on a codeword level.<br>
[0048]	Permuter 202 permutes codewords in accordance with the number of<br>
active physical or virtual antennas and the number of layers coupled to each codeword.<br>
For example, in a 4x4 MIMO system {i.e., 4 input layers and 4 output layers) employing<br>
a PGRC scheme, permuter 202 and communication apparatus 200 perform one of four<br>
operations depending on codeword correspondence and antenna activity. First, if only<br>
one antenna is active, communication apparatus 200 transmits data as one stream<br>
through the sole active antenna. Permuter 202 does not permute the data streams as<br>
there is only one combination in this instance. Second, if two antennas are active and<br>
each codeword corresponds to two layers, communication apparatus 200 transmits the<br>
data stream through the two active antennas as a group. A first portion of the data<br>
stream transmits through one of the two antennas and a second portion transmits<br>
through the other antenna of the group. Permuter 202 can symmetrically permute the<br>
data stream portions transmitted via the two antennas but such action does not attain any<br>
additional benefits. In this situation, the feedback essential for data rate adjustment is a<br>
base CQI reflecting the average effective SINR of the two active antennas.<br>
[0049|	Third, if two antennas are active and each codeword corresponds to a<br>
single layer, then there are two codewords. Communication apparatus 200 transmits the data as two streams encoded at different data rates with each stream transmitting through one of the two active antennas. Permuter 202 symmetrically permutes the two codewords across the two active antennas. In this example, successive blocks of a given codeword are transmitted through different antennas. For example, a first block of a codeword is transmitted through a first antenna, a second block through a second antenna, a third block through the first antenna, and so on. Blocks of a second codeword follow a complimentary permutation pattern. Permufing the codewords m this manner results in each codeword experiencing substantially the same channel conditions. Thus, the feedback comprises a base CQI reflecting the SINR of one of the codewords and a differential CQI reflecting the SINR gain obtained by cancelling interference of one codeword through successive interference cancellation. Moreover,<br><br>
each codeword can experience an increased spatial diversity, which improves the robustness of the system when the reported CQI is inaccurate due to the reporting delay, channel estimation error, and others. Therefore, with two active antennas and each codeword correspondii^ to one layer, permuter 202 performs essentially the same in a PGRC scheme as with a (S)PARC scheme described supra.<br>
[0050]	Fourth, if three antennas are active, a codeword may correspond to a<br>
single layer while the oflier codeword may correspond to two layers. In this case, permuter 202 should symmetrically permute the two codewords across the three active antermas. Accordmgly, permuter 202 can operate in situation where the codeword-to-layer correspondence is not equivalent for all codewords.<br>
[0051J	Finally, if four antennas are active and each codeword corresponds to<br>
two layers, communication apparatus 200 communicates data as two data streams<br>
encoded at different data rates with each data stream transmitting through a group of<br>
two antennas. Permuter 202 symmetrically permutes the two codewords across the two<br>
groups of antennas. The permutation scheme applied depends upon the antenna<br>
grouping utilized. The details of the permutation schemes are described infra,<br>
[0052]	The permuted codewords improve in terms of spatial diversity and<br>
experience substantially similar channel conditions resulting in well-behaved SINR values. The receiver employs successive interference cancellation to improve the SINR of the second data stream. Reconstructor 204 on the receiver side unmixes the two codewords. Reconstructor 204 is aware of the permutation scheme utilized by permuter 202 of the transmitter to mix the codewords. One of the two codewords is reconstructed and decoded. Feedback evaluator 206 measures the SINR viilue of the first decoded codeword or data stream. Feedback evaluator 206 employs the decoded data stream to reconstruct or regenerate the interference that it created during transmission. The regenerated mterference can be cancelled out of the superposition of the data streams. Thus, the second data stream or codeword can be decoded with less interference, resulting in a higher SINR value for the stream. Accordingly, the essential feedback is a base CQI representing the SINR of the first decoded codeword or data stream and a differential CQI representing the SINR gain obtained by cancelling the interference of the first codeword by successive interference cancellation.<br><br>
[0053]	Turning to Fig. 4, illustrated is a wireless communication system 400<br>
that effectuates codeword permutation in a MIMO system employing a PGRC scheme. System 400 includes two data streams (i.e.. Data Stream 1 and Data Stream 2) and four transmit antennas 316-322. Thus, system 400 is a 4x4 MIMO system. Data Stream 1 is encoded at a first data rate by an encoder 302. In one example, encoder 302 partitions Data Stream 1 mto binary blocks of a specified length and the blocks are mapped into a binary codeword. The codeword associated with Data Stream 1 is interleaved by interleaver 304. Interleaving is a process by which block of a data stream are rearranged or reordered in a non-contiguous maimer so as to improve performance. Mapper 306 receives the interleaved stream and maps it to modulation symbols to be transmitted v/a the antennas. Encoder 308, interleaver 310 and mapper 312 perform a similar operation with respect to Data Strean 2.<br>
(0054]	Following the processing of the data streams, a grouping circuit 314<br>
distributes the encoded data streams between the plurality of antennas 316-322. In one possible distribution, antenna 316 can transmit a first portion of encoded data stream 1 and anterma 318 can transmit a second portion of encoded data stream 1. Accordingly, antemias 320 and 322 can transmit a first and second portion of encoded data stream 2 respectively. It is to be appreciated that a variety of other groupings can be employed. For example, grouping circuit 314 can allocate anteimas 316 and 320 for encoded data stream 1 and antermas 318 and 322 for encoded data stream 2. in the exemplary system depicted in Fig. 4 with two data streams and 4 antermas, grouping circuit 314 can choose among six possible combmalions.<br>
[0055]	System 400 fiirther includes a permuter 402 that facilitates codeword<br>
permutation according to one aspect of die subject disclosure. Permuter 402 receives the anterma grouping from group circuit 314 and symmetrically mixes or permutes the two codewords over both anterma groups. Some exemplary permutation schemes are shown infra with respect to Figs. 5a-c. In exemplary system 400, the number of active antennas is assumed to be four, in which case there are six possible antenna groupings that map each codeword to two anteimas and six corresponding inter-codeword permutation schemes. Moreover, for each inter-codeword permutation schemes, there are four different intra-codeword permutation schemes, but different intra-codeword permutation schemes for an inter-codeword permutation do not contribute to further<br><br>
improving the system robustness, spatial diversity, and/or feedback information reduction in this example. Following permutation, each block of a codeword is transmitted throu^ a different antenna group ttian the previous block. For example, if the first block of a codeword is transmitted through an antenna groupmg comprises antennas 316 and 318, the second block of the codeword is transmitted through the second anteima grouping comprising antetmas 320 and 322.<br>
[0056]	Referring now to Figs. 5a-g, exemplary codeword permutation schemes<br>
are depicted. For the purposes of simplicity of explanation, the examples illustrate four<br>
antermas and two codewords. Those skilled in the art should appreciate how the<br>
permutation schemes can be applied to systems including a greater or lesser number of<br>
antermas and codewords. The depicted schemes are exemplary of those utilized in<br>
system 400 of Fig. 4. While six possible antenna groupings are possible in system 400,<br>
three groupings are symmetrical reflections of the other three. Accordingly, Figs. 5a-g<br>
individually illustrate the three overall groupings absent the reflections.<br>
[0057]	Turning to Fig. 5a, a permutation scheme is depicted. In a traditional<br>
PGRC scheme, codeword 1 is transmitted over the anteima group comprising antennas 1 and 2. Codeword 2 is, thus, transmitted over the antenna group of antennas 3 and 4. It is to be appreciated that in the symmetrical reflection, codeword 1 is transmitted over antennas 3 and 4 and codeword 2 over antennas 1 and 2. In the PGRC with codeword permutation, both codeword 1 and codeword 2 are transmitted over both antenna groupings as shown.<br>
[0058]	Referring to Fig. 5b, illustrated is another possible permutation scheme.<br>
Antennas 1 and 3 transmit codeword 1 and antermas 2 and 4 transmit codeword 2 under the original PGRC groupings, in the symmetrical grouping, codeword 1 transmits over anteimas 2 and 4 and codeword 2 transmits over antennas 1 and 3. Following codeword permutation, each codeword transmit over all four antennas. In particular, successive blocks of each codeword transmit over alternate groups. For example, in Fig. 5b, the first blocks of codeword 1 transmit over anteimas 1 and 3 and the next blocks transmit over antennas 2 and 4.<br>
[0059]	Turning now to Fig. 5c, another permutation scheme is illitstrated. In the<br>
original PGRC, codeword 1 is transmitted over antermas 1 and 4 and codeword 2 is<br><br>
transmitted over antennas 2 and 3. Following codeword permutation, codewords I and 2 are transmitted over all four antennas as depicted.<br>
[0060]	Referring now to Fig. 5d, yet another permutation scheme is illustrated,<br>
hi this example, there are three active antennas and two codewords. Codeword 1<br>
corresponds to only one layer while codeword 2 conesponds to two layers. In the<br>
original PGRC, codeword I is transmitted over antenna 1 and codeword 2 is transmitted<br>
over antennas 2 and 3. Following codeword permutation, codewords 1 and 2 are<br>
transmitted over all three active antennas. While Fig. 5d depicts a cycling permutation<br>
pattem, the disclosed subject matter is not so limited. For example, the codewords can<br>
be permuted according to a pseudo-random pattem. Additionally, codeword 2 may<br>
undergo intra-codeword permutation as described infra.<br>
[0061]	Turning now to Fig. 5e, another example permutation scheme is<br>
illustrated depicting inter-codeword permutation and intra-codeword permutation. Inter-codeword permutation is the permutation of codewords across antenna groups. Intra-codeword permutation relates to permuting a codeword within an antenna group. For example. Fig. 5e depicts an inter-codeword permutation scheme similar to that depicted in Fig. 5c with the addition of labels indicating the respective portions of the codewords. In the original PGRC, the portion of codeword 1 labeled A is transmitted over antenna 1 and the portion labeled B is transmitted over antenna 4. Similarly, the portion of codeword 2 labeled X is transmitted over antenna 2 and the portion labeled Y is transmitted over antenna 3. After permutation, the portion labeled A is not only transmitted over antennas 1 and 2 (or antennas 1 and 3) but, rather, transmits over all four antennas. The portions labeled B, X and Y are similarly permuted and transmitted. Thus, according to one aspect of the subject disclosure, intra-codeword permutation can occur along with inter-codeword permutation.<br>
[0062]	Referring now to Fig. 5f, another example permutation scheme is<br>
illustrated depicting codeword permutation without regard for original antenna groupings. In the original PGRC, codeword I and codeword 2 correspond to two layers. Codeword 1 is transmitted on antennas 1 and 2 and codeword 2 is transmitted on antennas 3 and 4. After permutation, codewords I and 2 are both transmitted over all four antennas based upon a cycling of all permutation patterns described supra with regard to Figs, 5a-c. In accordance with an aspect of the subject disclosure, permutation<br><br>
is not limited to original antenna groupings. For example, the group comprising<br>
antennas 1 and 2 can transmit portions of both codewords concurrently as shown.<br>
[0063]	Turning now to Fig. 5g, yet another permutation scheme is illustrated.<br>
Fig. 5g depicts intra-codeword permutation as shown in Fig. 5e and permutation without regard to original antenna groupings as shown in Fig. 5f. In the original PGRC, the portion of codeword 1 labeled A is transmitted over antenna 1 and the portion labeled B is transmitted over antenna 4. Similarly, the portion of codeword 2 labeled X is transmitted over antenna 2 and the portion labeled Y is transmitted over antenna 3. After permutation, the portions labeled A, B, X, and Y are transmitted over all four antennas without regard to the original groupings. For example, if the portion labeled A can be transmitted on antenna 2, the portion labeled B is not restricted to antenna 3 (j.e., the second antenna in the original grouping). Thus, according to one aspect of the subject disclosure, fiill permutation can occur.<br>
[0064]	Referring to Figs. 6-7, methodologies relatmg to permuting codewords in<br>
multi-codeword MIMO systems are illustrated. While, for purposes of simplicity of<br>
explanation, the methodologies are shown and described as a series of acts, it is to be<br>
understood and appreciated that the methodologies are not limited by the order of acts,<br>
as some acts may, in accordance with one or more embodiments, occur in different<br>
orders and/or concurrently with other acts from that shown and described herein. For<br>
example, those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate that a methodology<br>
could alternatively be represented as a series of interrelated states or events, such as in a<br>
state diagram. Moreover, not all illustrated acts may be required to implement a<br>
methodology in accordance with one or more embodiments.<br>
[0065]	Turning to Fig. 6, illustrated is a methodology 600 that facilitates<br>
reducing feedback for MIMO systems by permuted codewords prior to transmission. At 602, antenna groups are determined. An antenna group can include one or more physical or virtual antennas of the MIMO system. Antenna groups are determined based upon the MIMO configuration, the number of active antennas, the number of streams to be transmitted and the manner in which the data streams are encoded. For example, in a MIMO configuration with four active antennas and two streams, two groups of two antennas each can be employed. At 604, codewords are permuted over the antenna groups. Blocks or portions of the codewords are mixed based upon the<br><br>
combinations or permutations of the antenna groups. The number of cominbations depends upon the size of the groups and the MIMO configuration. For example, a 4x4 MIMO configuration with anterma groups comprising two antennt^ each has 2 antenna groups and, accordmgly, two permutations or combinations. At 606, the permuted codewords are transmitted via the antenna groups such that each codeword, in part, is transmitted over all antennas.<br>
[0066]	Now referring to Fig. 7, illustrated is a methodology 700 that provides<br>
feedback based upon peimuted codewords transmitted in a MIMO environment. At<br>
702, pennuted codewords are received via a forward link channel or downlink (e.g., in a<br>
MIMO system) and the codewords blocks are unmixed based upon the scheme<br>
employed to permute them prior to transmission. At 704, the data stream corresponding<br>
to a first codeword is decoded and reconstructed. Further, the interference created by<br>
the first stream during transmission is regenerated. At 706, a next data stream<br>
corresponding to a next codeword is decoded and reconstructed. During decoding, the<br>
regenerated interference from the first decoded stream is cancelled and the SINR value<br>
improves. If there are additional data streams and codewords, the interference created<br>
during transmission of the newly decoded stream is regenerated to be utilized in the<br>
same manner with regard to later decoded streams. Reference numeral 706 is repeated<br>
until all data streams have been decoded and reconstructed. At 708, feedback is<br>
provided on the uplink so that data rate adjustments can be made to improve<br>
performance of subsequent data hmismissions. The feedback comprises a base channel<br>
quality indicator (CQI) reflecting the effective or average SINR value of the first<br>
decoded codeword and a differential CQI reflecting the increase m SINR obtained by<br>
cancelling the interference of the first or previously decoded codewords.<br>
[00671	1^ ™111« appreciated that, in accordance with one or more aspects<br>
described herein, inferences can be made regarding identifying active antennas, determining codeword to layer correspondence, providmg channel related feedback, utilizing channel related feedback, etc. As used herem, the term to "infer" or "inference" refers generally to the process of reasoning about or inferring states of the system, environment, and^or user from a set of observations as captured via events and/or data. Inference can be employed to identify a specific context or action, or can generate a probability distribution over states, for example. The inference can be<br><br>
probabilistic-that is, the computation of a probability distribution over states of interest based on a consideration of data and events. Inference can also refer to techniques employed for composing higher-level events from a set of events and/or data. Such inference results in the construction of new events or actions from a set of observed events and/or stored event data, whether or not the events are correlated in close temporal proximity, and whether the events and data come from one or several event and data sources.<br>
[0068|	According to an example, one or more methods presented above can<br>
include making inferences pertaining to selecting a manner by which to group transmit antennas (e.g., selecting groupings based upon the codeword to layer correspondence and active antennas). By way of fixrther illustration, an inference may be made related to selecting whether to permute codewords in circumstances wherein benefits may or may not be obtained. It will be appreciated that the foregoing examples are illustrative in nature and are not intended to limit the number of inferences that can be made or the manner in which such inferences are made in conjunction with the various embodiments and/or methods described herein.<br>
[0069]	Fig. 8 is an illustration of a mobile device 800 that facilitates reducing<br>
feedback by utilizing codeword permutation in a MIMO system employing a Per Group<br>
Rate Confrol (PGRC) scheme. Mobile device 800 comprises a receiver 802 that<br>
receives a signal from, for instance, a receive antenna (not shown), and performs typical<br>
actions thereon (e.g., fihers, amplifies, downconverts, etc.) the received signal and<br>
digitizes the conditioned signal to obtain samples. Receiver 802 can be, for example, an<br>
MMSE receiver, and can comprise a demodulator 804 that can demodulate received<br>
symbols and provide them to a processor 806 for channel estimation. Processor 806 can<br>
be a processor dedicated to analyzing information received by receiver 802 and/or<br>
generating information for transmission by a transmitter 816, a processor that controls<br>
one or more components of mobile device 800, and/or a processor that both analyzes<br>
information received by receiver 802, generates information for transmission by<br>
transmitter 816, and controls one or more components of mobile device 800.<br>
[0070]	Mobile device 800 can additionally comprise memory 808 that is<br>
operatively coupled to processor 806 and that may store data to be transmitted, received data, information related to available channels, data associated with analyzed signal<br><br>
and/or interference strength, information related to an assigned chaimel, power, rate, or the like, and any other suitable information for estimating a channel and communicating via the channel. Memory 808 can additionally store protocols and/or algorithrns associated with estimating and/or utilizing a channel (e.g., performance based, capacity based, etc.).<br>
[0071J	It will be appreciated that the data store (e.g., memory 808) described<br>
herein can be either volatile memory or nonvolatile memory, or can include both<br>
volatile and nonvolatile memory. By way of illustration, and not limitation, nonvolatile<br>
memory can include read only memory (ROM), programmable ROM (PROM),<br>
electrically programmable ROM (EPROM), electrically erasable PROM (EEPROM), or<br>
flash memory. Volatile memory can include random access memory (RAM), which<br>
acts as external cache memory. By way of illustration and not limitation, RAM is<br>
available in many forms such as synchronous RAM (SRAM), dynamic RAM (DRAM),<br>
synchronous DRAM (SDRAM), double data rate SDRAM (DDR SDRAM), enhanced<br>
SDRAM (ESDRAM), Synchlink DRAM (SLDRAM), and direct Rambus RAM<br>
(DRRAM). The memory 808 of the subject systems and methods is intended to<br>
comprise, without being limited to, these and any other suitable types of memory.<br>
[0072]	Receiver 802 is fiirther operatively coupled to a depermuter 810 that<br>
unmixes the codewords transmitted over the forward link channel or downlink channel by a base station to mobile device 800. The codewords are permuted prior to transmission to increase the spatial diversity of each codeword and reduce the amount of feedback required to adjust the channels for increased performance. Since all the codewords are transmitted over all the antennas of the MIMO system, the codewords experience essentially the same conditions. The SNR or SINR values of the codewords will be well-behaved and closely related. Additionally, a feedback evaluator 812 may utilize the unmixed codewords and decoded data streams retained in memory 808 of mobile device 800 to determine a condensed feedback form to transmit over a reverse link channel or uplink channel to a base station. For example, the feedback evaluator 812 may perform successive interference cancellation on the codewords. Feedback evaluator 812 can regenerate the interference created by a first decoded data stream or codeword and employ the regenerated interference to cancel actual interference while decoding subsequent data stream or codewords. The cancellation increases the SNR or<br><br>
SINR value of the subsequent codeword. The feedback evaluator 812 determines a CQI base value indicated by the effective or average SINR value of the first decoded data stream and a CQI differential suggested by the SINR gain of the second codeword obtained by cancelling the interference of the first codeword. Alternatively, the CQI base value and the CQI differential can be derived by using the MIMO channel estimates obtained via reference signals (e.g., pilot signals), assuming certain cancellation statistics (e.g., no cancellation for the CQI base value and perfect cancellation for the CQI differential). Mobile device 800 still further comprises a modulator 814 and a transmitter 816 that transmits a signal (e.g., base CQI and differential CQI) to, for instance, a base station, another mobile device, etc. Although depicted as being separate from the processor 806, it is to be appreciated that depermuter 810, feedback evaluator 812 and/or modulator 814 may be part of processor 806 or a number of processors (not shown).<br>
(0073]	Fig. 9 is an illustration of a system 900 that facilitates reducing the<br>
amount of feedback required to control forward link transmission in a MIMO system implementing a PGRC scheme. System 900 comprises a base station 902 (e.g., access point,...) with a receiver 910 that receives signal(s) from one or more mobile devices 904 through a plurality of receive antennas 906, and a transmitter 922 that transmits to the one or more mobile devices 904 through a plurality of transmit antennas 908. Receiver 910 can receive information from receive antennas 906 and is operatively associated with a demodulator 912 that demodulates received information. Demodulated symbols are analyzed by a processor 914 that can be suniiar to the processor described above wilh regard to Fig. 8, and which is coupled to a memory 916 that stores information related to estimating a signal (e.g., pilot) strength and/or interference strength, data to be transmitted to or received from mobile device(s) 904 (or a disparate base station (not shown)), and/or any other suitable information related to performing the various actions and functions set forth herein. Processor 914 is further coupled to a grouper 918 that deternunes groupings of transmit antennas 908 to uUlize for data transmission in accordance with a PGRC scheme. Grouper 918 establishes groups based upon a number of active antennas and a layer-to-codeword ratio. For example, grouper 918 may group antennas in sets of two antennas each with one data stream or codeword to be transmitted on each set.<br><br>
[0074]	Grouper 918 may be further coupled to a permuter 920 that mixes<br>
codewords across all anteima groupings based upon the initial group designations. For example, if a first codeword is assigned to a first anterma group and a second codeword is assigned to a second group, permuter 920 mixes codewords blocks of the first and second codewords between both antenna groups. Encoding data streams relative to a group of antennas reduces the complexity of base station 902. Separate MCS systems are not necessary for each antenna included in the MIMO system's transmit aiitermjis 908 as would be required in a (S)PARC scheme. For example, if base station 902 has 4 antennas, it requires 4 MCS systems in a (S)PARC scheme but can eliminate at least 2 MCS systems by employing a PGRC scheme. Further, the amount of feedback required to control subsequent transmission is also reduced. Information utilized to control subsequent transmissions may be provided to a modulator 922. For example, modulator receives the base CQI and differential CQI evaluated by mobile device 802 Irom Fig. 8. Modulator 922 can multiplex the control information for transmission by a transmitter 926 through antenna 908 to mobile device(s) 904. Although depicted as being separate fi-om the processor 914, it is to be appreciated that group circuit 918, permuter 920 and/or modulator 922 may be part of processor 914 or a number of processors (not shown).<br>
[0075]	Fig. 10 shows an example wireless communication system 1000. The<br>
wireless communication system 1000 depicts one base station 1010 and one mobile device 1050 for sake of brevity. However, it is to be appreciated that system lOOO may include more than one base station and/or more than one mobile device, wherein additional base stations and/or mobile devices may be substantially similar or different from example base station 1010 and mobile device 1050 described below. In addition, it is to be appreciated that base station 1010 and/or mobile device 1050 may ernploy the systems (Figs. 1-4 and 8-9) and/or methods (Figs. 6-7) described herein to facilitate wireless communication there between.<br>
10076]	At base station 1010, traffic data for a nimiber of data streams is<br>
provided from a data source 1012to atransmit(TX) data processor 1014. According to an example, each data stream may be transmitted over a respective antenna. TX data processor 1014 formats, codes, and interleaves the traffic data stream based on a particular coding scheme selected for that data stream to provide coded data.<br><br>
[0077]	The coded data for each data stream may be multiplexed with pilot data<br>
using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) techniques. Additionally or alternatively, the pilot symbols can be frequency division multiplexed (FDM), time division multiplexed (TDM), or code division multiplexed (CDM). The pilot data is typically a known data pattern that is processed in a known manner and may be used at mobile device 1050 to estimate channel response. The multiplexed pilot and coded data for each data stream may be modulated (e.g., symbol mapped) based on a particular modulation scheme (e.g., binary phase-shift keying (BPSK), quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK), M-phase-shift keying (M-PSK), M-quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM), etc.) selected for that data stream to provide modulation symbols. The data rate, coding, and modulation for each data stream may be determined by instructions performed or provided by processor 1030.<br>
[0078]	The modulation symbols for the data streams may be provided to a TX<br>
MIMO processor 1020, which may fijrther process the modulation symbols (e.g., for OFDM). TX MIMO processor 1020 then provides iVr modulation symbol streams to Nj transmitters (TMTR) 1022a through 1022t. In various embodiments, TX MIMO processor 1020 applies beamforming weights to the symbols of the data streams and to the antenna from which the symbol is being transmitted.<br>
[0079]	Each transmitter 1022 receives and processes a respective symbol stream<br>
to provide one or more analog signals, and fiirther conditions (e.g.. amplifies, filters, and upconverts) the analog signals to provide a modulated signal suitable for transmission over the MIMO channel. Further, A'r modulated signals from transmitters 1022a through 1022t are transmitted fi-om Nr antennas 1024a through 1024t, respectively.<br>
[0080]	At mobile device 1050, the transmitted modulated signals are received<br>
by iV/f antennas 1052a through 1052r and the received signal from each antenna 1052 is provided to a respective receiver (RCVR) 1054a through 1054r. Each receiver 1054 conditions (e.g., filters, amplifies, and downconverts) a respective signal, digitizes the conditioned signal to provide samples, and further processes the samples to provide a corresponding "received" symbol stream.<br>
[0081]	An RX data processor 1060 may receive and process the NR received<br>
symbol sfreams from NR receivers 1054 based on a particular receiver processing<br><br>
technique to provide NT "detected" symbol streams. RX data processor 1060 may demodulate, deinterleave, and decode each detected symbol stream to recover the traffic data for the data stream. The processing by RX data processor 1060 is complementary to that performed by TX MIMO processor 1020 and TX data processor 1014 at base station 1010.<br>
[0082}	A processor 1070 may periodically determine which preceding matrix to<br>
utilize as discussed above. Further, processor 1070 may formulate a reverse link<br>
message comprising a matrix index portion and a rank value portion.<br>
[0083]	The reverse link message may comprise various types of information<br>
regarding the communication link and/or the received data stream. The reverse link message may be processed by a TX data processor 1038, which also receives traffic data for a number of data streams  from a data source 1036, modulated by a modulator 1080, conditioned by transmitters 1054a through 1054r, and transmitted back to base station 1010.<br>
[0084]	At base station 1010, the modulated signals from mobile device 1050 are<br>
received by antennas 1024, conditioned by receivers 1022, demodulated by a demodulator 1040, and processed by a RX data processor 1042 to extract the reverse link message transmitted by mobile device 1050. Further, processor 1030 may process the extracted message to determine which preceding matrix to use for determining the beamforming weights.<br>
[0085]	Processors 1030 and 1070 may direct (e.g., control, coordinate, manage,<br>
etc.) operation at base station 1010 and mobile device 1050, respectively. Respective processors 1030 and 1070 can be associated with memory 1032 and 1072 that store program codes and data. Processors 1030 and 1070 can also perform computations to derive frequency and impulse response estimates for the uplink and downlink, respectively.<br>
[0086]	It is to be understood that the embodiments described herein may be<br>
implemented in hardware, software, firmware, middleware, microcode, or any combination thereof For a hardware implementation, the processing units may be implemented within one or more application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), digital signal processors (DSPs), digital signal processing devices (DSPDs), programmable logic devices (PLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), processors, controllers.<br><br>

functions described herein, or a combination thereof.<br>
[0087]	When the embodiments are implemented in software, firmware,<br>

A code segment may represent a procedure, a function, a subprogram, a program, a routine, a subroutine, a module, a software package, a class, or any combination of instructions, data structures, or program statements. A code segment may be coupled to another code segment or a hardware circuit by passing and/or receiving information, data, arguments, parameters, or memory contents. Information, arguments, parameters, data, etc. may be passed, forwarded, or transmitted using any suitable means including memory sharing, message passing, token passing, network transmission, etc.<br>
[00S8]	For a software implementation, the techniques described herein may be<br>
implemented with modules (e.g., procedures, functions, and so on) that perform the functions described herein. The software codes may be stored in memory units and executed by processors. The memory unit may be implemented within the processor or external to the processor, in which case it can be communicatively coupled to the processor via various means as is known in the art.<br>
[0089]	With reference to Fig. 11, illustrated is a system 1100 that facilitates<br>
reducing required feedback on a reverse link channel of a MIMO system by transmitting codewords in a PGRC scheme through all active antennas. For example, system 1100 may reside at least partially within a base station. It is to be appreciated that system 1100 is represented as including functional blocks, which may be functional blocks that represent functions implemented by a processor, software, or combination thereof (e.g., firmware). System 1100 includes a logical grouping 1102 of electrical components that can act in conjunction. For instance, logical groupmg 1102 may include an electrical component for identifying a level of codeword to layer correspondence 1104. For example, in a MIMO environment implementing a per group rate control scheme, a codeword can correspond to two layers (e.g., physical antennas, virtual antennas, etc.). It is to be appreciated that a codeword can correspond to any number of layers. Further, logical grouping 1102 may comprise an electrical component for formulating groups of transmit antennas 1106. Groups are determined at least in part on the level of codeword<br><br>
to layer correspondence. For example, when each codeword corresponds to two layers, then groups of two transmit antennas each are formulated. Moreover, logical grouping 1102 may include an electrical component for performing symmetrical permutations of codewords 1108. According to an example wherein a codeword is associated with two layers, groups of two antennas each can be utilized. Traditionally, each group transmits one codeword. After a symmetrical permutation, each codeword is mixed between all antenna groups such that each group transmits, in part, every codeword. Further, transmission of codewords in permuted form enables every codeword to experience substantially similar channel conditions. This results in well behaved channel quality values which vary little codeword to codeword. Additionally, system 1100 may include a memory 1110 that retains mstructions for executing functions associated with electrical components 1104,1106, and 1108. While shown as being external to memory 1110, it is to beunderstood that one or more of electrical components 1104,1106, and 1108 may exist within memory 1110.<br>
[0090]	Turning to Fig. 12, illustrated is a system 1200 that calculates reduced<br>
feedback by employing successive interference operations on permuted codewords. System 1200 may reside within a mobile device, for instance. As depicted, system 1200 includes functional blocks that may represent functions implemented by a processor, software, or combination thereof (e.g., firmware). System 1200 includes a logical grouping 1202 of electrical components that facilitate controlling forward link transmission. Logical grouping 1202 may include an electrical component for receiving permuted codewords 1204. For example, a receiver is included in a MIMO system with multiple receiver antennas and each permuted codeword is received by all receive antennas. Moreover, logical grouping 1202 may include an electrical component for reconstructing received codewords 1206. According to an example, the codewords are received in permuted form. The codewords are unmixed and reconstructed. It is to be appreciated that the permutation scheme employed during transmission is known so that the codewords can be depermuted. Further, logical grouping 1202 may comprise an electrical component for regenerating interference created by a iirst codeword 1208. After, reconstructing the codewords and decoding a first codeword, the interference created by the first decoded codeword is regenerated. Also, logical grouping 1202 may mclude an electrical component for cancelling the regenerated interference in additional<br><br>
codewords 1210. For example, the regenerated interference is subtracted while<br>
decoding a second codeword to improve signal and channel quality. Additionally,<br>
system 1200 may include a memory 1212 that retains instructions for executing<br>
functions associated with electrical components 1204, 1206, 1208, and 1210. While<br>
shown as being external to memory 1212, it is to be understood that electrical<br>
components 1204,1206, 1208, and 1210 may exist within memory 1212.<br>
