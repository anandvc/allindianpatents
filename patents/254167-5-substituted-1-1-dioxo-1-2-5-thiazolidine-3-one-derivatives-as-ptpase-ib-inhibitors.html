In starting compounds and intermediates which are converted to the compounds of the invention in a manner described herein, functional groups present, such as amino, thiol, carboxyl, and hydroxy groups, are optionally protected by conventional protecting groups that are common in preparative organic chemistry. Protected amino, thiol, carboxyl, and hydroxyl groups are those that can be converted under mild conditions into free amino thiol, carboxyl and hydroxyl groups without the molecular framework being destroyed or other undesired side reactions taking place.<br>
The purpose of introducing protecting groups is to protect the functional groups from undesired reactions with reaction components under the conditions used for carrying out a desired chemical transformation. The need and choice of protecting groups for a particular reaction is known to those skilled in the art and depends on the nature of the functional group to be protected (hydroxyl group, amino group, etc.), the structure and stability of the molecule of which the substituent is a part and the reaction conditions.<br>
Well known protecting groups that meet these conditions and their introduction and removal are described, for example, in McOmie, "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry", Plenum Press, London, New York (1973); and Greene and Wuts, "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", John Wiley and Sons, Inc, New York (1999).<br>

Any resulting mixtures of isomers can be separated on the basis of the physico-chemical differences of the constituents, into the pure geometric or optical isomers, diastereoisomers, racemates, for example by chromatography and/or fractional crystallization.<br>
Any resulting racemates of final products or intermediates can be resolved into the optical antipodes by known methods, e.g. by separation of the diastereoisomeric salts thereof, obtained with an optically active acid or base, and liberating the optically active acidic or basic compound. The carboxylic acid intermediates can thus be resolved into their optical antipodes e.g. by fractional crystallization of d- or l-(alpha-methylbenzylamine, cinchonidine, cinchonine, quinine, quinidine, ephedrine, dehydroabietylamine, brucine or strychnine)-salts. Racemic products can also be resolved by chiral chromatography, e.g. high pressure liquid chromatography using a chiral adsorbent.<br>

The activity of a compound according to the invention may be assessed by the following methods or by following methods well described in the art (e.g. Peters G. et al. J. Biol. Chem, 2000, 275, 18201 -09).<br>
For example, the PTP-1B inhibitory activity in vitro may be determined as follows:<br>
Assessment of human PTP-1B (hPTP-1 B) activity in the presence of various agents is determined by measuring the amount of inorganic phosphate released from a phosphopeptide substrate using a 96-well microliter plate format. The assay (100 ^L) is performed in an assay buffer comprised of 50 mM TRIS (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCI, 3 mM DTT at ambient temperature. The assay is typically performed in the presence of 0.4% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). However, concentrations as high as 10% are used with certain poorly soluble compounds. A typical reaction is initiated by the addition of 0.4 pmoles of hPTP-IB (amino acids 1-411) to wells containing assay buffer, 3 nmoles of the synthetic phosphopeptide substrate (GNGDpYMPtVlSPKS), and the test compound. After 10 min, 180 ^L malachite green reagent (0,88 mM malachite green, 8.2 mM ammonium molybdate, aqueous 1 N HCI, and 0.01% Triton X-100) is added to terminate the reaction. Inorganic phosphate, a product of the enzyme reaction, is quantitiated after 15 min as the green color resulting from complexing with the Malichite reagent and is determined as an Asso using a Molecular Devices (Sunnyvale, CA) SpectraMAX Plus spectrophotometer. Test compounds are solubilized in 100 % DMSO (Sigma, D-8779) and diluted in DMSO. Activity is defined as the net change in absorbance resulting from the activity of the uninhibited hPTP-1 B[iwnii minus that of a tube with acid-inactivated hPTP-1B[i.4ii].<br>
ThehPTP-1B[Mii] is cloned by PGR from a human hippocampal cDNA library (Clonetech) and inserted into a pET 19-b vector (Novagen) at the Nco1 restriction site. E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) is transformed with this clone and stored as a stocl<: culture in glycerol at for enzyme production a stocl is inoculated into lb and grown expression of ptp-1 b initiated by induction with mm iptg after the had reached an odsoo="0.6." bacterial pellet collected centrifugation. cells are resuspended lysis buffer tris naci dtt triton x-100 ph7.6 incubated on ice min then sonicated x losec></:><br>
bursts at full power). The lysate is centrifuged at 100,000 x g for 60 min and the supernatant is buffer exchanged and purified on a cation exchange POROS 20SP column followed by an anion exchange Source 30Q (Pharmacia) column, using linear NaCI gradient elutions. Enzyme is pooled, adjusted to 1 mg/mL and frozen at -80° C.<br>
Competitive binding to the active site of the enzyme can be determined as follows:<br>
Ligand binding is detected by acquiring 'H-^^N HSQC spectra on 250 IJLL of 0.15 mM PTP-IBM ■2981 '^ ^'^® presence and absence of added compound (1-2 mM). The binding is determined by the observation of '°N- or M-amide chemical shift changes in two dimensional HSQC spectra upon the addition of a compound to ^^N-label protein. Because of the ^^N spectral editing, no signal from the ligand is observed, only protein signals. Thus, binding can be detected at high compound concentrations. Compounds which caused a pattern of chemical shift changes similar to the changes seen with known active site binders are considered positive.<br>
All proteins are expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) containing plasmids constructed using pET19b vectors (Novagen).  Uniformly ^^N-labeled PTP-IB1.298 is produced by growth of bacteria on minimal media containing ^^N-labeled ammonium chloride. All purification steps are performed at 4°C. Cells (-15 g) are thawed briefly at 37°C and resuspended in 50 mL of lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCI, 150 mM NaCI, 5 mM DTT, pH 8.0 containing one tablet of Complete (EDTA-free) protease cocktail (Boehringer Mannheim), 100 p.M PMSF and 100 i^g/mL DNase I. The cells are lysed by sonication. The pellet is collected at 35,000 x g, resuspended in 25 mL of lysis buffer using a Polytron and collected as before. The two supernatants are combined and centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 x g. Diafiltration using a 10 kD MWCO membrane is used to buffer exchange the protein and reduce the NaCI concentration prior to cation exchange chromatography. Diafiltration buffer contained 50 mM MES, 75 mM NaCI, 5 mM DTT, pH 6.5. Soluble supernatant is then loaded onto a POROS 20 SP (1 X 10 cm) column equilibrated with cation exchange buffer (50 mM MES and 75 mM NaCI, pH 6.5) at a rate of 20 mL/min. Protein is eluted from the column using a linear salt gradient (75-500 mM NaCI in 25 CV). Fractions containing PTP-1 B's are identified and pooled according to SDS-PAGE analyses. PTP-1 B1.298 is further purified by anion exchange chromatography using a POROS 20 HQ column (1x10 cm). The pool from cation exchange chromatography is concentrated and buffer exchanged in 50 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.5 containing 75 mM NaCI and 5 mM DTT. Protein is loaded onto column at 20 mLVmin and eluted using a linear NaCI gradient (75-500 mM in 25 CV). Final purification is<br><br>
performed using Sephacryl S-100 HR (Pharmacia)(50 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCI, 3 mM DTT, pH 7.5 ). The NMR samples are composed of uniformly '^N-labeled PTP-IB1.298 (0.15 mM) and inhibitor (1-2 mM) in a 10%D2O/90%H2O Bis-Tris-dig buffer (50 mM, pH = 6.5) solution containing NaCi (50 mM), DL-1, 4-Dithiothreitol-dio (5mM) and Sodium azide<br>
(0.02%).<br>
The 'H-^^N HSQC NMR spectra are recorded at 20°C, on Bruker DRX500 or DMX600 NMR spectrometers. In all NMR experiments, pulsed field gradients are applied to afford the suppression of solvent signal. Quadrature detection in the indirectly detected dimensions is accomplished by using the States-TPPI method. The data are processed using Bruker software and analyzed using NMRCompass software (MSI) on Silicon Graphics computers.<br>
The glucose and insulin lowering activity in vivo may be evaluated as follows:<br>
Adult male C57BL ob/ob mice (Jackson Lab, Bar Harbor, ME) at the age of 11 weeks are housed six per cage in a reversed light cycle room (light on from 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.) and given access to Purina rodent chow and water ad libitum. On day 1 tail blood samples are taken at 8:00 am and plasma glucose levels are determined. The animals are randomly assigned to the control and compound groups. The means of plasma glucose values of the groups are matched. Animals are then orally dosed with vehicle (0.5% carboxymethyl-cellulose with 0.2% Tween-80) or compounds (at 30 mg/kg) in vehicle. The mice are dosed daily for a total of 3 days. On day 4 basal blood samples are taken. The plasma samples are analyzed for glucose concentrations using a YSI2700 Dual Channel Biochemistry Analyzer (Yellow Springs Instrument Co., Yellow Springs, OH) and insulin concentrations using an ELISA assay.<br>
