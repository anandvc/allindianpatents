				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
5-SUBSTITUTED-2-PHENYLAMINO-BENZAMIDE AS MEK INHIBITOR<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds having MEK inhibitory activity and<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, intermediates for synthesis of the compounds, andpharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds or pharmaceutically acceptable salts<br>
thereof.The compounds of the present invention can be used as MEK inhibitors. The<br>
compounds can be used to treat proliferative diseases, for example, cancers, psoriasis, restenosis,<br>
autoimmune diseases, and atherosclerosis, and other diseases such as sequelae of heart failure,<br>
heterograft rejection, osteoarthritis, chronic rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, cystic fibrosis,<br>
hepatomegalia, cardiac hypertrophy, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, septic shock, and HIV<br>
infection.<br>
Background Art<br>
Cell survival is regulated by various extracellular signals, for example, growth factors,<br>
cytokines, and extracellular matrices (ECM), via cell surface receptors.<br>
Two major signal transduction pathways regulate the process of signal transduction<br>
from the cell surface to the nucleus. One is the Ras signaling pathway, and the other is the<br>
PI3K (Phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase) pathway. The PI3K pathway is either activated via cell<br>
surface receptors or indirectly by Ras. The present invention focuses on the Ras signaling<br>
pathway.<br>
The MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) cascade which comprises three kinases,<br>
namely, Raf, MEK (MAPK or ERK kinase), and ERK (extracellular stimulus regulated kinase),<br>
is a key component of the Ras signaling pathway. The cascade starts with the activation of Ras<br>
and in response to extracellular signals, plays an important role in regulating cell proliferation,<br>
differentiation, and transformation (Person, G, F. Robinson, T. Beers Gibson, B. Xu, M.<br>
Karandikar, K. Berman, and M. H. Cobb. Endocrine Rev., 22,153-183 (2001); Bryan A. Ballif<br>
and John Blenis, Cell Growth &amp; Differentiation, 12, 397-408 (2001); Cobb MH, Prog. Biophys.<br>
Mol. Biol., 71 479-500 (1999); Lewis TS, Shapiro PS and AhnNG. Adv. Cancer Res., 74 49-139<br>
(1998); Kolch W, Biochem. J., 351, 289-305 (2000); Judith S Sebolt-Leopold, Oncogene, 19,<br>
6594-6599 (2000); Roman Herrera and Judith S. Sebolt-Leopold, Treds in Molecular Medicine,<br>
8,827-831(2002)).Ras activation is regulated through the interplay between GTP-exchange factors (GEFs)<br>
and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) (Giorgio Scita, Pierluigi Tenca, Emanuela Frittoli<br>
Arianna Tocchetti, Metello Innocenti, Giuseppina Giardina and Pier Paolo Di Fiore, EMBO<br>
Journal. 19, 2393-2398 (2000)). GEFs activate Ras through the formation of Ras-GTP complex,<br>
and GAPs inactivate Ras through the formation of Ras-GDP complex. Ras activation results<br>
from growth factor-mediated extracellular signals to cell surface receptors or from Ras mutations.<br>
Ras mutations are found in many human cancer cells. It is known that such Ras mutations<br>
result in sustained Ras activation (GTP complex) and play key roles in the proliferation of<br>
human cancer cells.<br>
Activated Ras interacts with Raf-1, a serine/threonine protein kinase, to activate Raf-1<br>
(Daum G, Eisenmann-Tappe I, Fries HW, Troppmair J and Rapp UR, Trends Biochem. Sci., 19,<br>
474-480 (1994); Stokoe D, Macdonald SG, Cadwallader K, Symons M and Hacock JF, Science,<br>
264,1463-1467(1994)).<br>
Activated Raf-1 then phosphorylates and activates MEK1 and MEK2. MEK is<br>
phosphorylated on two serine residues (Ser218 and Ser222) (Dent P, Haser W, Haystead TA,<br>
Vincent LA, Roberts TM and Sturgill TW, Science, 257, 1404-1407 (1992); Crews CM,<br>
Alessandrini A and Erikson RL, Science, 258, 478-480 (1992); Her JH, Lakhani S, Zu K, Vila J,<br>
Dent P, Sturgill TW and Weber MJ, Biochem. J., 296,25-31 (1993); Alessi, D. R., Y. Saito, D. G.<br>
Campgell, P. Cohen, G. Sithanandam, U. Rapp, A. Ashworth, C. J. Marshall, and S. Cowley.<br>
Trends Biochem. Sci. 21 373-372 (1994); Zheng, C. F., and K. L. Guan. J. Biol. Chem. 268,<br>
23933-23939 (1993)).<br>
MEK is a dual-specificity kinase. Activated MEK phosphorylates ERK1 and ERK2 on<br>
tyrosine (185) and threonme (183) residues (Anderson NG, Mailer JL, Tonks NK and Sturgill TW,<br>
Nature, 343, 651-653 (1990); Seger R and Krebs EG, FASEG J, 9 716-735 (1995)).<br>
The MEK-mediated ERK phosphorylation results in not only ERK activation but also<br>
translocation of ERK to the nucleus.<br>
Activated ERK (MAPK) activates various substrates, for example, transcription factors<br>
hi the cytoplasm and nucleus, and the result is that the activation leads to cellular changes<br>
(proliferation, differentiation, and transformation) depending on the extracellular signal.<br>
MEK has a strict substrate specificity. ERK1 and ERK2 are the only substrates of<br>
MEK phosphorylation that have been identified (Seger R, Ahn NG, Posada J, Munar ES, Jensen<br>
AM, Cooper JA, Cobb MH and Kregs EG, J. Biol. Chem., 267, 14373-14381 (1992)).<br>
Strict substrate specificity (limited substrates: ERK1 and 2) and dual specificity<br>
(phosphorylation on both tyrosine and threonine), which are unique properties of MEK bur<br>
rarely found in other kinases, are suggested to play a central role in the MEK integration of<br>
signals in the MAPK pathway.<br>
Constitutive activation of the MEK/MAPK pathway is shown to be associated with the<br>
neoplastic phenotypes of a relatively large number of cancer cell types (Hoshino R, Chatani Y,<br>
Yamori T, Tsuruo T, Oka H, Yoshida O, Shimada Y, Ari-I S, Wada H, Fujimoto J, Kohno M,<br>
oncogene, 18, 813 (1999); Kim SC, Hahn JS, Min YH, Yoo NC, Ko YW, Lee WJ, Blood, 93,<br>
3893 (1999); Morgan MA, Dolp 0, Reuter CW, Blood, 97,1823 (2001)).<br>
In addition, constitutive activation of MEK has been reported to result in cellular<br>
alteration (transformation or canceration) (Cowley S, Paterson H, Kemp P and Marshall CJ, Cell,<br>
77, 841-852 (1994); Mansour SJ, Marten WT, Hermann AS, Candia JM, Rong S, Fukasawa K,<br>
Vande Woude GF and AhnNG, Science, 265, 966-970 (1994)).<br>
Furthermore, studies of MEK inhibitors (PD98059 and others) have revealed that MEK<br>
inhibition not only results in impaired cell proliferation, but also has impact on various cellular<br>
events, including cell differentiation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis (Dudley DT, Pang L, Decker<br>
SJ, Bridges AJ and Saltiel AR, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 92, 7686-7689 (1995); Alessi DR,<br>

USA., 90, 8319-8323 (1993); Pang L, Sawada T, Decker SJ and Saltiel AR., J. Biol. Chem., 270,<br>
13585-13588 (1995); Finalay D, Healy V, Furlong F, O'Connell FC, Keon NK and Martin F, Cell<br>

The above-described findings suggest that MEK, one of the major mediators in the<br>
MAPK cascade, can serves as a potential target for therapeutic agents used in treating diseases<br>
caused by aberrant cell proliferation.<br>
There are many previously reported MEK inhibitors including, for example, compounds<br>
having the backbone structure of a 2-phenylaminobenzoic acid or a derivative thereof, and which<br>
comprise various types of substituents at different positions (US Patent No. 6251943; US Patent<br>
No. 6310060; US Patent No. 6506798; International Publication WO 98/37881; WO 99/01421;<br>

00/41505; WO 00/41994; WO 00/42002; WO 00/42003; WO 00/42022; WO 00/42029; WO<br>
00/64856; WO 01/05390; WO 01/05391; WO 01/05392; WO 01/05393; WO 01/68619; WO<br>

04/056789; and Japanese Patent Application Kokai Publication No. (JP-A) 2001-55376<br>
(unexamined published Japanese patent application)). The previously reported compounds also<br>
include N-alkoxy-2-phenylamino-benzamide derivatives which have an alkoxy residue as the<br>
substituent on the amide nitrogen atom. Furthermore, the reported compounds also include<br>
compounds which comprise as a substituent, a halogen atom, a carbamoyl group, a sulfamoyl<br>
group, or such, at position 5 of the benzamide ring (International Publication WO 98/37881; WO<br>
99/01426; WO 00/42003; WO 01/68619; and WO 02/06213).<br>
Meanwhile, the anti-cancer effect of compounds comprising the feature of an MEK<br>
inhibitor, as reported, has been drawing attention. Such compounds include, for example,<br>
compound CI-1040 described below (in Example 95 of WO 99/01426). The result of a phase I<br>
clinical trial of compound CI-1040 was reported in the American Society of Clinical Oncology<br>
Annual Meeting in 2002 (American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting in 2002<br>
(Abstract Nos. 320 and 321; May, 18-21, 2002)). However, various problems have been<br>
pointed out, for example, rapid hydrolysis and inactivation of the compound in vivo; high lipid<br>
solubility and low water solubility; and a wide interpatient variability in pharmacokinetic<br>
parameters. The clinical trial for CM 040 was thus terminated. At present, PD0325901 (WO<br>
02/06213) is currently at the stage of a phase II clinical trial in U.S.<br>
Meanwhile, there are reports on methods of preventing or treating rheumatoid arthritis<br>
or osteoarthritis using compounds having MEK-inhibiting activity (International Publication WO<br>
00/35436; WO 01/68619; and JP-A2001-55376).<br>

The present inventors synthesized the above-described<br>
N-alkoxy-2-phenylaminobenzamide derivatives for the first time. The inventors found that the<br>
compounds have an unexpectedly strong MEK inhibitory effect regardless of the substituent in<br>
position 5. In addition, the inventors found that the compounds of the present invention have a<br>
superior effect with respect to tumor growth suppression activity, as well as a superior effect<br>
towards inflammation-related joint disorders.<br>
Interestingly, the compounds of the present invention were found to have superior<br>
effects in addition to the MEK inhibitory activity. Specifically, the compounds of the present<br>
invention were found to be highly stable in hepatic micro somes, as compared with other<br>
N-alkoxy-2-phenylamino-benzamide derivatives. Furthermore, the compounds were found to<br>
be more soluble in water in comparison with conventional compounds.<br>
The Cmax and AUC values, and the half-life for the above-described compounds of the<br>
present invention are expected to be higher than those of conventional compounds.<br>
Furthermore, the compounds of the present invention are expected to have good in vivo<br>
absorption, and low interpatient variability in the PK parameters. The active forms can exist at<br>
high concentrations in blood for a long period of time. Thus compared with the conventional<br>
compounds, sufficient levels of the active forms of the compounds of the present invention are<br>
exposed to the target molecule (i.e., MEK) as. The increased efficacy and the less frequent<br>
administration as resulted are expected to reduce the burden of patient.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The present invention is illustrated in more detail below with reference to Examples.<br>
However, the present invention is not to be construed as being limited thereto.<br>
NMR analyses were performed on JNM-EX270 (270 MHz, JEOL) or JNM-GSX400<br>
(400 MHz, JEOL), and the NMR data are expressed as ppm (parts per million, 8) referencing the<br>
deuterium lock signal from the sample solvent.<br>
Mass spectral data were obtained using JMS-DX303 (JEOL) or JMS-SX/SX102A<br>
(JEOL), or a micromass spectrometer (Navigator, Finnigan) equipped with a gradient high<br>
performance liquid chromatography (Agilent 1100, Agilent Technologies).<br>
Specific rotation was measured using sodium D line (589 nm) at room temperature.<br>
Commercially available reagents were used without further purification. Room<br>
temperature represents a range from about 20 to about 25°C. All the non-aqueous reactions<br>
were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere. Concentration or evaporation of the solvent<br>
under reduced pressure was done using a rotary evaporator.<br>
In the preparation of a compound, functional groups were protected with protecting<br>
110<br>
groups as needed, and after having prepared the target molecule, the protecting groups were<br>
removed. The selection of the protecting groups and the procedures for protection and<br>
deprotection were done according to the methods described in, for example, Greene and Wuts,<br>
"Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis" (2nd Ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1991).<br>

Step A<br>
Synthesis of 2-methyl-propane- 1 ,2-diol<br>
HO<br>
2-Methyl-propane-l,2-diol is a known compound (CAS No. 558-43-0), and may be<br>
prepared by one of the method described in the following literatures:<br>
Zh. Obshch. Khim. 7,1319 (1937),<br>
Chem. Zentralbl. 109, 561 (1938),<br>
Meml. Poudres, 28,263 (1938), and<br>
Chem. Zentralbl. 110,2398 (1939).<br>
Practically, the title compound was prepared by the following procedure.<br>
To a suspension of lithium aluminum hydride (321.3 mg, 8.47 mmol) in THF (5 ml) was<br>
added dropwise a solution of 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-propionic acid methyl ester (commercially<br>
available, 1.0 g, 8.47 mmol) in THF (3 ml), and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for<br>
4 hours. Water (0.70 ml) was added to the reaction mixture, which was stirred for additional 10<br>
minutes. The resultant mixture was filtered through a mixed bed of celite powder and sodium<br>
sulfate powder. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the residue was<br>
diluted with THF, dried over sodium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure to give<br>
2-methyl-propane-1,2-diol (659.7 mg, 86%) as an oily crude product.<br>

[Test Example 3]<br>
[Measurement of stability against mouse liver microsome]<br>
A variety of metabolic enzymes exist in the liver, and play a key role in the foreign<br>
substance detoxication. Many enzymes involved in drug metabolism (e.g., cytochrome P450)<br>
are localized in the endoplasmic reticulum in the cells, and are collected in the microsome<br>
fraction during preparation from the cells. The stability in liver microsome is used universally<br>
as a simple measure for evaluation of drug metabolism.<br>
There is a correlation between in vitro intrinsic clearance calculated from the stability in<br>
human liver microsome and human in vivo clearance (Ito K. et al. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.<br>
Toxicol. 1998, 38: 461-99, Naritomi Y. et al. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2001,29:1316-24, Yuichi<br>
Sugiyama et al., Pharmacokinetics - Understanding by exercises, Nanzando).<br>
Clearance is an important parameter that determines a blood concentration. The better<br>
the drug stability in liver microsome is, the smaller the clearance is and the higher the blood<br>
concentration is. A drug having a good stability in liver microsome can achieve a certain blood<br>
212<br>
concentration with a lower dose, compared to a drug having a poor stability.<br>
Compounds B-l, B-2, B-6, B-9, B-12, C-l, C-2, C-6, C-7, C-10, C-24, C-28, C-29,<br>
C-31, C-34, C-35, F-l, F-2, F-5, F-7, G-l, G-2, G-3, G-4, and G-5 obtained in the Examples, and<br>
the known compounds, P, Q, and R shown above were incubated with mouse liver microsome (1<br>
mg protein/mL) in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 5 mM MgCb and 2 mM<br>
NADPH (the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) at 37°C for 1 hour.<br>
After the enzyme reaction was terminated with the addition of a three-fold volume of acetonitrile,<br>
the reaction mixture was centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 minutes, and the resultant supernatant<br>
was used as a test sample to measure the stability in human liver microsome by quantitating the<br>
compound in the sample using FIPLC/MS.<br>
Table 3 shows the stability of the test compounds in mouse liver microsome. When a<br>
test compound has a longer half-life, the compound is metabolically very stable, and can produce<br>
a high blood concentration.<br>
[Test Example 4]<br>
[Measurement of water solubility]<br>
Biopharmaceutical Classification System (BCS) is widely used to scientifically classify<br>
oral formulations in regard to membrane permeability and solubility. Drugs having good<br>
membrane permeability and good solubility are classified into Class 1, and guaranteed that they<br>
are absorbed almost perfectly after oral administration, and that the variability among individuals<br>
is small (Lenneras H. et al. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 2005, 57: 273-85, KasimNAef al. Mol.<br>
Pharmaceutics 2004,1: 85-96).<br>

obtained in the Examples, and the known compounds, P, Q, and R shown above was added to a<br>
glass vessel, to which 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) was added. The vessel was sealed,<br>
sonicated at room temperature (20°C) for 10 minutes, and agitated on an agitator for 2 hours.<br>
After dissolution equilibrium was achieved, the reaction mixture was filtered through a<br>
membrane filter, and the solute concentration in the filtrate was determined by HPLC.<br>

[Measurement of tumor growth suppressive activity]<br>
A mouse model carrying human cancer was used to measure tumor growth suppressive<br>
activity of Compounds B-l, C-l, C-10, C-13, F-l, F-2, F-5, G-l, G-2, G-3, G-4, and H-<br>
obtained in the Examples, and the known compound, Q shown above.<br>
Human colon cancer cell line HT-29 (obtained from American Type Culture Collection)<br>
was inoculated subcutaneously to BALB/c nu/nu mice. The test compound was dissolved in<br>
213<br>
the vehicle (10% Cremophor, 10% ethanol, and 80% distilled water for injection), and orally<br>
given to the mice once a day for 14 consecutive days after the average tumor volume (0.5x long<br>
diameter x short diameter2) reached to about 200 mm3. One day after the last administration,<br>
the tumor volume was measured, and the tumor growth suppression rate, (1 - tumor volume<br>
increase in the group received the test compound/tumor volume increase in the group received<br>
the vehicle) x 100, of each of the test compounds was determined compared to the group<br>
received the vehicle. The higher value (%) indicates the stronger tumor suppressive activity.<br>
Results of the tumor growth suppression rate at maximum tolerance dose (MTD) are<br>
shown in Table 4.<br>
Table 4 shows very high tumor growth suppression rates of the compounds of this<br>
invention, indicating that they have very strong effect of tumor regression, compared to control<br>
compound Q, which has the tumor growth suppression rate of 66 - 82%.<br>
[Test Example 6]<br>
Anti-Type II collagen antibody-induced arthritis in mice]<br>
Suppressive effects of compounds B-l and G-2 obtained in Examples on arthritis<br>
development were determined using anti-Type II collagen antibody (anti-CII)-induced arthritis (J<br>
Immunol. 2002 Aug 1; 169(3):1459-66).<br>
Anti-CII (10 mg/mL of antibody cocktail for arthritis, code No. 62200, Chondrex) was<br>
administered intravenously at 1 mg/body/100 jaL to BALB/c mice (female mice of 5 weeks old<br>
were purchased from Charles River Japan, Inc., and used at 5 animals per group after 1 week<br>
acclimation), and after 3 days, LPS (lipopolysaccharide) solution (0111:B4 250 p-g/mL, code No.<br>
62200, Chondrex) was administered intraperitoneally at 25 j.ig/0.1 mL/body. The test<br>
compounds were dissolved in the vehicle (10% Cremophor, 10% ethanol, and 80% distilled<br>
water for injection), and orally administered 1 hour before, 1, 2,4-8, and 11 days after LPS<br>
administration (once a day, 1 mg/kg).<br>
Arthritis score was evaluated with the full score 4 points per limb, and 16 points per<br>
animal. Score indicates as follows:<br>
0.5: erythema is observed at 1 joint;<br>
1: erythema is observed at 2 joints. Or reddening of the upper surface of the paws is observed,<br>
but swelling is not observed;<br>
2: Slight swelling is observed;<br>
3: Moderate swelling is observed on the upper surface of the paws;<br>
4: Severe swelling is observed on the upper surface of the paws and digits.<br>
In the group received the vehicle, arthritis developed the day after LPS administration.<br>
On the other hand, arthritis development was strongly suppressed in both groups received B-l<br>
and G-2. Results of suppressive effect on arthritis development (arthritis score; mean +/-<br>
214<br>
standard deviation) are shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 shows that the present compounds <br>

[Measurement of stability against mouse liver microsome]<br>
A variety of metabolic enzymes exist in the liver, and play a key role in the foreign<br>
substance detoxication. Many enzymes involved in drug metabolism (e.g., cytochrome P450)<br>
are localized in the endoplasmic reticulum in the cells, and are collected in the microsome<br>
fraction during preparation from the cells. The stability in liver microsome is used universally<br>
as a simple measure for evaluation of drug metabolism.<br>
There is a correlation between in vitro intrinsic clearance calculated from the stability in<br>
human liver microsome and human in vivo clearance (Ito K. et al. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.<br>
Toxicol. 1998, 38: 461-99, Naritomi Y. et al. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2001,29:1316-24, YuichiSugiyama et al., Pharmacokinetics - Understanding by exercises, Nanzando).<br>
Clearance is an important parameter that determines a blood concentration. The better<br>
the drug stability in liver microsome is, the smaller the clearance is and the higher the blood<br>
concentration is. A drug having a good stability in liver microsome can achieve a certain blood<br>
concentration with a lower dose, compared to a drug having a poor stability.<br>
Compounds B-l, B-2, B-6, B-9, B-12, C-l, C-2, C-6, C-7, C-10, C-24, C-28, C-29,<br>

the known compounds, P, Q, and R shown above were incubated with mouse liver microsome (1<br>
mg protein/mL) in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 5 mM MgCb and 2 mM<br>
NADPH (the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) at 37°C for 1 hour.<br>
After the enzyme reaction was terminated with the addition of a three-fold volume of acetonitrile,<br>
the reaction mixture was centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 minutes, and the resultant supernatant<br>
was used as a test sample to measure the stability in human liver microsome by quantitating the<br>
compound in the sample using FIPLC/MS.<br>
Table 3 shows the stability of the test compounds in mouse liver microsome. When a<br>
test compound has a longer half-life, the compound is metabolically very stable, and can produce<br>
a high blood concentration.<br>

[Measurement of water solubility]<br>
Biopharmaceutical Classification System (BCS) is widely used to scientifically classify<br>
oral formulations in regard to membrane permeability and solubility. Drugs having good<br>
membrane permeability and good solubility are classified into Class 1, and guaranteed that they<br>
are absorbed almost perfectly after oral administration, and that the variability among individuals<br>
is small (Lenneras H. et al. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 2005, 57: 273-85, KasimNAef al. Mol.<br>
Pharmaceutics 2004,1: 85-96).<br>

obtained in the Examples, and the known compound, Q shown above.<br>
Human colon cancer cell line HT-29 (obtained from American Type Culture Collection)<br>
was inoculated subcutaneously to BALB/c nu/nu mice. The test compound was dissolved in<br>
the vehicle (10% Cremophor, 10% ethanol, and 80% distilled water for injection), and orally<br>
given to the mice once a day for 14 consecutive days after the average tumor volume (0.5x long<br>
diameter x short diameter2) reached to about 200 mm3. One day after the last administration,<br>
the tumor volume was measured, and the tumor growth suppression rate, (1 - tumor volume<br>
increase in the group received the test compound/tumor volume increase in the group received<br>
the vehicle) x 100, of each of the test compounds was determined compared to the group<br>
received the vehicle. The higher value (%) indicates the stronger tumor suppressive activity.<br>
Results of the tumor growth suppression rate at maximum tolerance dose (MTD) are<br>
shown in Table 4.<br>
Table 4 shows very high tumor growth suppression rates of the compounds of this<br>
invention, indicating that they have very strong effect of tumor regression, compared to control<br>
compound Q, which has the tumor growth suppression rate of 66 - 82%.<br>

Anti-CII (10 mg/mL of antibody cocktail for arthritis, code No. 62200, Chondrex) was<br>
administered intravenously at 1 mg/body/100 jaL to BALB/c mice (female mice of 5 weeks old<br>
were purchased from Charles River Japan, Inc., and used at 5 animals per group after 1 week<br>
acclimation), and after 3 days, LPS (lipopolysaccharide) solution (0111:B4 250 p-g/mL, code No.<br>

compounds were dissolved in the vehicle (10% Cremophor, 10% ethanol, and 80% distilled<br>
water for injection), and orally administered 1 hour before, 1, 2,4-8, and 11 days after LPS<br>
administration (once a day, 1 mg/kg).<br>
Arthritis score was evaluated with the full score 4 points per limb, and 16 points per<br>
animal. Score indicates as follows:<br>
0.5: erythema is observed at 1 joint;<br>
1: erythema is observed at 2 joints. Or reddening of the upper surface of the paws is observed,<br>
but swelling is not observed;<br>
2: Slight swelling is observed;<br>
3: Moderate swelling is observed on the upper surface of the paws;<br>
4: Severe swelling is observed on the upper surface of the paws and digits.<br>
In the group received the vehicle, arthritis developed the day after LPS administration.<br>
