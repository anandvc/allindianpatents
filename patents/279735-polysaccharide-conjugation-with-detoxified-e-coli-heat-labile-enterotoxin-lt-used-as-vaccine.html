				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>A detoxified recombinant E. coli heat-labile enterotoxin mutant  LTS61K  is employed as a carrier protein to conjugate polysaccharide. The LTS61K contains a mutated mature sub-unit A (LTA) that includes lysine at amino acid position 61 and a wild-type mature sub-unit B (LTB). Various types of bacterial capsular polysaccharide antigens were chemically conjugated with the LTS61K protein by a reductive amination reaction. The conjugated polysaccharide-LTS61K products were physically  chemically and biochemically identified as soluble form. Rabbits were immunized intramuscularly to determine the immunogenicity of conjugated vaccines by ELISA to detect anti- polysaccharide antigen IgG titers and serum bactericidal assay thereby determining the functional activity of the antibodies. Study results show that conjugated polysaccharide-LTS61K vaccines induce higher polysaccharide-specific IgG titers and greater bactericidal activity in sera than that of polysaccharide alone or polysaccharide mixed with LTS61K. The presence of anti-LTS61K serum IgG antibody alleviates travel diarrhea caused by E. coli</td>

The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Cross-Reference to Related Applications:<br>
<br>
<br>
[0001] Priority is claimed to U.S. Provisional Patent <br>
<br>
Application Serial No. 61/330 650  filed on May 3  2010  the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
<br>
<br>
Background of the Invention:<br>
<br>
<br>
[0002] Polysaccharide vaccines  when prepared without carrier protein  lack immune memory responses. Currently known conjugated vaccines include bacterial capsular polysaccharides such as Haemophilus influenzae type b  Neisseria meningitidis group C  and Streptococcus pnemoniae serotypes 1  3  4  5  6B  7F  9V  14  19F  23F. These vaccines are covalently conjugated to a carrier protein  such as tetanus toxoid  diphtheria toxoid  CRM197  a mutant nontoxic diphtheria toxin  or Neisseria meningitidis outer membrane protein. These <br>
<br>
polysaccharide conjugate vaccines could induce T-cell dependent response  especially in infants below the age of two years; and they could prime long term immunologic memory  produce high affinity antibody  and could lower the rate of nasopharyngeal colonization and transmission. <br>
<br>
However  the majority of the currently marketed bacterial <br>
<br>
polysaccharide conjugate vaccines applied tetanus toxoid (TT) or diphtheria toxoid (DT) as a carrier protein. TT and DT  these two toxoid proteins  are regular vaccines for infants/children; high frequency vaccination of TT and DT within a short time could have impact on the immunogenicity and safety. (Reduced response to multiple vaccines <br>
<br>
sharing common protein epitopes that are administered simultaneously to infants. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66(5):2093-8; Immunogenicity and safety of a combination pneumococcal-meningococcal vaccine in infants: a randomized controlled trial. JAMA 2005 ;293( 14): 1751-8). Therefore  this invention provides a new type of the carrier protein LTS61K for its use on the conjugate vaccine.<br>
<br>
<br>
Summary of the Invention:<br>
<br>
<br>
[0003] This invention includes polysaccharide conjugation with a detoxified E. coli heat labile enterotoxin (LT) useful as vaccine to protect or immunize against the effects of infectious bacteria such as Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae and alleviate travel diarrhea caused by enterotoxigenic E. coli.<br>
<br>
<br>
[0004] One aspect of this invention relates to covalently conjugated polysaccharide-LTS61K vaccines isolated in purified form. These conjugated products have unexpectedly superior immunogenic and bactericidal properties in mammals. Another aspect relates to a method of administering an effective amount of conjugated polysaccharide-LTS61K vaccine to a mammal in need of protection from Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). The vaccines of the present invention stimulate T-helper cell response  exhibit strong booster response upon re-exposure and have high antibody titers.<br>
<br>
<br>
[0005] Yet another aspect of the invention relates to the method of producing conjugated polysaccharide-LTS61K by reductive amination and isolating purified conjugated product. In accordance with the present invention  it was discovered that the preferred method of conjugating polysaccharide and LTS61K for making the vaccine of the <br>
<br>
present invention is periodate oxidation of native PS followed by reductive amination.<br>
<br>
<br>
[0006] The LTS61K employed in the conjugates of the present invention is described in PCT Application Number <br>

Detailed Description of the Invention:<br>
<br>
<br>
[0030] We have now discovered that conjugated <br>
<br>
polysaccharide-LTS61K vaccines made in accordance with the present invention surprisingly induce higher polysaccharide-specific IgG antibody titers and greater bactericidal activity in sera than that of polysaccharide or polysaccharide mixed with LTS61K.<br>

<br>
[0032] The new carrier protein employed in the conjugates of the present invention is detoxified recombinant E. coli heat-labile enterotoxin mutant  LT  more specifically LTS61K. In the LT mutant  the A and B sub-units form a typical AB5 holotoxin structure. The detoxified LT mutant (LTS61K) contains a mutated mature sub-unit A (LTA) that includes K at amino acid position 61 and a wild-type mature sub-unit B (LTB). LTS61K renders the product significantly less toxic than wild-type LT. The carrier protein is depicted in Figure 1 of the drawings.<br>
<br>
<br>
[00331 The invention of the LTS61K  which was selected as one of the starting materials for the present invention  is based on the unexpected discovery that an LT containing a mutated LTA exhibits reduced toxicity compared to its wild type counterpart while retaining immunogenicity. This mutated LTA has an amino acid substitution at the position corresponding to position 61 of a wild-type LTA  whose amino acid sequence  SEQ ID NO: 5  is shown in the cited patent applications incorporated by reference herein. Accordingly  LTS61K features an isolated polypeptide including a mutated LTA that contains an amino acid residue other than S  T  and F  at the position corresponding to position 61 of SEQ ID NO: 5. The substituting amino acid residue can be D  E  H  I  K  L  N  P  Q  R  Y or W. It can be a naturally occurring amino acid or a non-naturally occurring amino acid  e.g.  a D-amino acid or a ß-amino acid. In one example  the LTA has the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2  4  8 or 10. An LT containing this mutated LTA exhibits reduced toxicity  i.e.  
<br>
<br>
[0034] In accordance with the present invention  <br>
<br>
Haemophilus influenzae type B was cultured and its capsular <br>
<br>
polysaccharide antigen  polyribosylribitol phosphate (PRP)  was purified. The PRP is linear  has a negative charge and is hydrophilic. The Hib PRP saccharide with molecular weight 345 and formula 10C 18H 1 10  IP is depicted as in Figure 2 of the drawings. <br>
<br>
[0035] PRP is conjugated onto LTS61K by a chemical reductive amination reaction employing appropriate molar ratios of polysaccharide PRP to protein (LTS61K) which produce conjugate vaccines. Ranges of molar ratios of PRP:LTS61K are shown in Table 1  below. Preferably  the range of molar ratios of PRP:LTS61K is between about 3 : 1 and about 60:1  and mole /mole I047PRP is between about 0.1 and about 0.4.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
[0036] Further in accordance with the present invention  a variety of different types of the bacterial capsular polysaccharides antigens from Haemophilus influenzae type b and Streptococcus pneumoniae are chemically conjugated with the LTS61K protein by reductive amination reactions. A variety of different molar ratios of NaI04:PRP as shown in Table 1  above  were employed to oxidize polysaccharides to produce short lengths of polysaccharides with different repeating units. Following the proper molar ratio of the polysaccharide reacted with LTS61K  the successfully conjugated and purified polysaccharide-LTS61K conjugate products were obtained. The products were in soluble form and were physically and chemically evaluated by SEC-HPLC  orcinol  SDS-PAGE  western blotting  IEF  GM1 -binding activity  circular dichroism and fluorescent assays to identify the successful chemical conjugation of the polysaccharide antigen and LTS61K carrier protein.<br>
<br>
<br>
Example of the procedure of making polysaccharide conjugated with LTS61K:<br>
<br>
<br>
[0037] A variety of potential conjugation processes are illustrated in Figure 3 of the drawings. A generalized flow diagram of the reductive amination process selected in accordance with the present invention is found at Glyconjugate J. 1989.6:489 and is reproduced as Figure 4 of the drawings.<br>
<br>
<br>
[0038] In accordance with the present invention  a <br>
<br>
polysaccharide is cleaved by periodate oxidation to smaller fragments to produce aldehyde end groups. Thereafter  conjugation of the oxidized polysaccharide to LTS61K protein is carried out by reductive amination. More specifically  an example of the process is as follows:<br>
<br>
<br>
[0039] A. Polysaccharide activation (periodate oxidation): Native polyribosylribitol phosphate (PRP)  which is purified capsular polysaccharide of Haemophilus influenzae type b  in an amount of 5 mg/mL is mixed with periodate (I04") 0.3 or 0.6 or 1.2 mg/mL (molar ratio (m/m) of I04" to PRP = 0.1  0.2  0.4). This mixture was allowed to stand at 4°C in the dark for 24 hours. Then glycerol was added to terminate the reaction. The resulting oxidized PRP underwent dialysis against ddH20 using 3.5 K membrane to remove impurities. The resulting product was sterile filtered with 0.22 um filter. The periodate oxidation procedure provided fragmentation of the polysaccharide PRP into different chain lengths. The range of average number of repeating units of PRP was about 40 to 10.<br>
<br>
<br>
[0040] B. Polysaccharide-LTS61K conjugation: Preparation of PRP and LTS61K conjugate  mixture of oxidized PRP obtained from above  purified LTS61K (which was disclosed in the previous <br>
<br>
obtained/filed patents) and sodium cyanoborohydride (NaBH3CN)  in 10 mg/mL  3 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL  respectively  the reaction was earned for 2 weeks at 4°C in the dark. The reaction was terminated by adding sodium borohydride NaBH4 to quench unreacted aldehydes on PRP  the preparation was then dialyzed against ddH20 with 10 K membrane.<br>
<br>
<br>
[0041] C. Characterization of the polysaccharide conjugated LTS61K products: Following the proper molar ratio of the <br>
<br>
polysaccharide reacted with LTS61K  the successfully conjugated and purified polysaccharide-LTS61K conjugate products were obtained. The products with soluble form were physically  chemically and biologically evaluated by SEC-HPLC  Orcinol  SDS-PAGE  Western blotting  IEF  GM1 -binding activity  circular dichroism and fluorescent assays to confirm the successful chemical conjugation of the polysaccharide antigen and LTS61K earner protein  ratio of polysaccharide to LTS61K protein  and its immunogenicity. Figure 5 of the drawings summarizes reaction conditions and assays employed in accordance with specific exemplification of the present invention. <br>

Mammalian pre-clinical studies showing efficacy of the polysaccharide-LTS61K conjugates:<br>
<br>
<br>
[0053] New Zealand White rabbits were immunized intramuscularly three times  at two week intervals  using the intended human dose of the polysaccharide  polysaccharide mixed with LTS61K  or polysaccharide-LTS6K conjugate to evaluate the potency of the conjugate vaccines. All vaccine preparations contained no A1P04 or other related adjuvant. The immune responses of all vaccines were determined by ELISA to detect anti-polysaccharide antigen specific IgG titers and serum bactericidal assay to detect the functional activity of the antibodies. The study results indicated that only successfully conjugated polysaccharide-LTS61 K vaccines could induce higher poly sac charide-specific IgG antibody titers and greater bactericidal activity in sera than that of polysaccharide alone  or polysaccharide mixed with LTS61K only. The animal immunogenicity studies suggest that detoxified E. coli heat-labile enterotoxin holotoxin including LTS61K protein is useful as carrier protein of polysaccharide to significantly stimulate a specific immune response of polysaccharide antigens.<br>

<br>
<br>
[0060] Additional studies were conducted employing the procedures and observing the results set forth below:<br>
<br>
<br>
[0061] New Zealand White rabbits were immunized intramuscularly three times and four times  at two week intervals  using the intended human dose of the polysaccharide  polysaccharide mixed with LTS61K  and polysaccharide-LTS61K conjugate to evaluate the • potency of the conjugate vaccines. All preparations contained no A1P04 or other related adjuvant. The immune responses of all vaccines were determined by ELISA to detect anti-polysaccharide antigen specific IgG titers and serum bactericidal assay to show the functional activity of the antipolysaccharide antibodies. The responses of sera anti-LTS61K IgG titers were also determined by ELISA  and in vitro Caco-2 cell cAMP induction and Y-l adrenal cell toxicity rounding up study were used to determine the sera anti-LTS61K Ab neutralizing ability with the wild type LT. In vivo rabbit ileal loop challenge studies were conducted to examine the function of the anti-LTS61K antibodies. The animal immunogenicity studies suggest that detoxified E. coli heat-labile enterotoxin holotoxin including LTS61K protein is useful as earner protein of polysaccharide to significantly stimulate a specific response of polysaccharide antigens. LTS61K  itself  can be used as an immunogen  and  effectively produces antibodies against wild type LT.<br>

<br>
[0062] A. Rabbit immunogenicity studies. Rabbit <br>
<br>
immunization intramuscularly using 10 ug dose of PRP  with test articles including: PRP  PRP conjugated with LTS61K and PRP mixed with LTS61K; two and three boosters were given at biweekly intervals. Blood samples were collected at 14 days after each immunization  and collected serum samples were stored at <br>
<br>
-80°C until use.<br>
<br>
<br>
[0063] B. Anti-polysaccharide and anti-LTS61K antibodies determined by ELISA. PRP-BSA conjugate was coated on the 96- well plate in the concentration of PRP at 100 ng/well for anti-PRP antibodies determination  and coated with LTS61K at 250 ng/well for the anti-LTS61K antibodies determination. The coated plates were incubated for 16 hours at 4°C   and following incubated with 5% skim milk as blocking buffer for one hour at 37°C . Animal sera were tested starting from a dilution of 1 :50. Specific antibodies were measured using a horseradish peroxidate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG incubated for 1 hour at 37°C   and revealed the antibodies by adding TMB (tetramethyl benzidine) peroxidase substrate  and after 10 minutes  the reaction was terminated by the addition of 12% H2S04 and the absorbance was read at OD (optical density) 650-450 nm (reference wavelength 650 mn). The ELISA titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the last dilution which gave OD 450 =0.5.<br>
<br>
<br>
[0064] C. Serum bactericidal assay. Antibody dependent complement mediated bactericidal activity was conducted for the serum diluted titers that kill more than 50% of the Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) colonies. Serum samples were pretreated in 56°C for 30 minutes to inactivate the complement of rabbit serum. Two fold serial dilutions of the serum samples with volume of 10 uL in 96-well U-bottom plates were prepared. Following  added 20 uL of the diluted Hib culture which was prepared in 1000 CFU/20 uL. The mixtures were further incubated at 37°C with 5% C02 for 15 minutes  and added 50 uL of the 1 : 1 hank""s buffer diluted baby rabbit complement into each well  and incubated the mixture at 37°C with 5% C02 for 60 minutes. Plated 5 uL of the baby rabbit complement added mixture in the chocolate agar plates  and incubated the plates at 37°C with 5% C02 for 16 hours. Counted the Hib colony forming units and determined the serum dilution titers that killed more than 50% Hib colonies. All the serum samples are compared with the reciprocal number of dilution titers in graphics.<br>
<br>
<br>
[0065] D. Induction of cAMP study in Caco-2 cells by the neutralized wild type LT with rabbit anti-LTS61K serum antibody was performed  using a cyclic AMP (cAMP) EIA kit (Enzo Life Science). Ten nanograms of wild type LT were incubated with 150 uL anti-LTS61K rabbit serum (1 : 100 dilution) at room temperature. After one hour incubation  the mixture was added to the Caco-2 cell plate <br>
<br>
(5xl04cell/well)  and Caco-2 cells were further incubated at 37°C with<br>
<br>
5% C02 for 2 hours. Following  cells were washed with PBS  and lysed with 0.1M HCL (200 uL per well)  and neutralized with 0.1 M NaOH. The cell lysis products were collected by centrifugation at 660 xG for 10 mins at room temperature. The resultant suspensions were assayed for intracellular cAMP levels by utilizing the commercial EIA kit.<br>
<br>
<br>
[0066] E. Neutralization study of wild type LT with serious dilutions of rabbit anti-LTS61K serum was examined on Y-l mouse adrenal tumor cells. For the Y-l cell assay  serial two fold dilutions of rabbit sera 5 OX  100X tol02 400X were premixed with wild type LT 10" 5ug (which is the EC 50  that the toxin concentration of the wild type LT to produce greater than 50% cell rounding up on Y-l adrenal cell)  following the mixture were added to Y-l adrenal cell  5 x 104 cells/well. <br>
<br>
The cells were observed for morphological changes (cell rounding up) after 24 hours incubation.<br>
<br>
<br>
[0067] F. Rabbit ileal loop fluid accumulation study: the neutralization of the rabbit anti-LTS61K serum antibody against the wild type LT was conducted in the rabbit ileal loop assay. Rabbit ileal loops with 5.5 cm segments were made on the rabbits after being immunized with PRP or PRP conjugated with LTS61K or PRP mixed with LTS61K. Wild type LT in the concentration ranges from 0.01 to 1 ug were administrated to each study animal; the amount of fluid accumulated in each segment was measured after 18 hours.<br>
<br>
<br>
Results of the immunogenicity effect of polysaccharide conjugated with LTS61K: mammalian pre-clinical studies showing efficacy of the polysaccharide-LTS61K conjugates<br>
<br>
<br>
[0068] The study results are described below with reference to Figures 20 through 23 of the drawings and Tables 3 through 5.<br>
<br>
<br>
[0069] Antibodies to PRP and to LTS6 IK were determined by ELISA. Results of immunogenicity in rabbits were shown in Figure 20; only rabbits given PRP -LTS6 IK conjugates three injections elicit high anti-PRP IgG antibody titers and were 1000-fold greater than PRP or PRP mixed with LTS61K. The major immunoglobulin induced by PRP-LTS61K conjugates vaccine was IgG. The presence of high titer of anti-LTS61K IgG antibody did not interfere with the immune response of anti-PRP IgG Ab.<br>
<br>
<br>
[0070] In Figure 20  which shows the rabbit immunogenicity ELISA of anti-PRP and anti-LTS61K antibodies response results  all animals received a total of three intramuscular doses each of 10 ug conjugated PRP at 2 week intervals. Sera were collected and assayed at one week post dose 1 (1 WPD1)  one week post dose 2 (1 WPD2) and two weeks post dose 3 (2WPD3) as depicted in Figure 20.<br>
<br>
<br>
[0071 ] The protective potential of the anti-PRP antibodies induced by the conjugates were evaluated by testing the bactericidal activity of the rabbit sera. The bactericidal titers were determined against Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) Eagen strain  data were presented as reciprocal serum dilution that killed more than 50 % of the Hib colonies. Figure 21 shows that rabbits after three times intramuscular immunization  at two week intervals  in PRP 10 ug per dose  the anti-PRP IgG Abs and bactericidal titers were similar in all of the three batches of in-house prepared PRP-LTS61K conjugates  with the conjugated PRP average repeating units in 40 or 10  and the PRP-LTS61K conjugates doses 10 ug/48 ug to 10 ug/30 ug per dose. Meanwhile  PRP and PRP mixed with LTS61K immunized rabbit sera were unable to kill the Hib bacterial  which reciprocal titers 
<br>
<br>
[00721 Figure 21 shows rabbit serum bactericidal assay and anti-PRP IgG antibodies responses after rabbits received three intramuscular doses each of 10 ug conjugated PRP at 2 week intervals. Tested sera were collected at day 43  two weeks post dose 3.<br>
<br>
<br>
[0073] A re-boosted study was conducted on rabbits after they received a primary -three immunization of the PRP-LTS61K <br>
<br>
conjugates. The results are summarized in Figure 22  which <br>
<br>
demonstrated bactericidal titers and anti-PRP IgG antibodies titers <br>
<br>
gradually decreased with time  although 6WPD3 (6 weeks post dose 3) rabbit sera bactericidal titers were lower than the rabbit sera 2WPD3  the rabbit sera anti-PRP IgG antibodies and bactericidal titers could be effectively enhanced after a following dose of PRP-LTS61K conjugates. However  these phenomena could not be observed on the PRP or PRP mixed with LTS61K immunized rabbits.<br>
<br>
<br>
[0074 j Regarding Figure 22  rabbits were immunized with different ratios of PRP-LTS61K conjugates. The sera were obtained at different times  and ELISA anti-PRP IgG Abs and bactericidal assays were performed. The results demonstrate correlations between the serum anti-PRP IgG antibodies and the serum bactericidal activities  and that a 4 immunization on rabbits with PRP-LTS61K conjugates effectively re-boosts the anti-PRP Abs.<br>
<br>
<br>
[0075] Table 3 shows that wild type LT toxin at 10 ng was unable to stimulate an increase of intracellular releasing of the cAMP levels in Caco-2 cells  only when rabbit sera with high anti-LTS61K antibodies; those were PRP-LTS61K conjugates and PRP mixed with LTS61K immunized rabbit sera. In contrast  rabbit sera obtained from PRP immunized rabbits did not prevent wild type LT from increasing cAMP levels in Caco-2 cells. <br>
<br>
Table 3 : Induction of cAMP study in Caco-2 cells by the neutralized wild type LT with rabbit anti-LTS61K serum antibody.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
[0076] A neutralization study of wild type LT with serial dilutions of rabbit anti-LTS61K serum was conducted on Y-1 mouse adrenal tumor cells. The results in Table 4 demonstrate that only those rabbits"" sera present with the anti-LTS61K antibodies effectively neutralize the toxicity of the wild type LT  which occurred on PRP- LT61K conjugates and PRP mixed with LTS61K immunized rabbit sera  but not in sera of rabbits immunized with PRP.<br>
<br>
<br>
Table 4 Neutralization Study<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
[0077] The data in Table 5 shows that at the concentration of 0.01 ug per 5.5 cm segment ileal loop of wild type LT fluid accumulation was induced in the rabbit with no anti-LTS61K antibodies; however  in the rabbit with anti-LTS61K antibodies  there was no fluid accumulation. These results confirm those previously obtained in vitro Caco-2 cAMP induction and Y-l adrenal cell neutralization studies  that serum anti- LTS61K antibodies are able to neutralize the wild type LT. Severe hemorrhagic lesions on ileum mucosa were observed on the rabbit without anti-LTS61K Ab administered with wild type LT in 0.5 and 1.0 ug per segment.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Fluid accumulation is measured in each 5.5 cm segment of rabbit ileal loop. Severe hemorrhagic lesions on ileum mucosa were observed on the rabbit without anti-LTS61K Ab administered wild type LT in 0.5 and 1.0 ug per segment.<br>
<br>
<br>
[0078] The results of an animal immunogenicity study as an example of pneumococcal polysaccharide serotype 14 covalent <br>
<br>
conjugated with LTS61K is shown in Figure 23. Antibody titers to PNPS serotype 14 were determined by ELISA. Samples were PNPS 14-LTS61K conjugates with PS average repeating units of 94 or 40  PNPS 14 alone  PNPS 14 mixed with LTS61K  and PBS. Only the conjugated products were able to induce high anti-PNPS 14 IgG antibodies. The presence of the chemical adjuvant  aluminum hydroxide  during the immunization program did not benefit or significantly enhance the anti-PNPS 14 antibodies.<br>
<br>
<br>
10079] Figure 23 shows the immunogenicity in mice on pneumococcal PS serotype 14-LTS61K conjugates. Only animals given PNPS 14-LTS61K conjugates elicit high anti-PS IgG antibody titers and were 500-fold greater than PNPS 14 or PNPS 14 mixed with LTS61K.<br>
