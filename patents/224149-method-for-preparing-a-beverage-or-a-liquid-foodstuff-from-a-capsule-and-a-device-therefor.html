				<td>METHOD FOR PREPARING A BEVERAGE OR A LIQUID FOODSTUFF FROM A<br>
CAPSULE AND A DEVICE THEREFOR<br>
The present invention relates to a method for preparing a beverage or a liquid foodstuff from a<br>
capsule, a capsule containing a substance to be extracted, and a device for carrying out the method.<br>
It is already known how to prepare a beverage from a capsule containing a product to be extracted,<br>
for example coffee, such as is described in the international patent application WO 92 07775. The<br>
capsule is received inside a capsule carrier or housing of the device, which can be pressed sealingly<br>
against an injection head designed as to inject hot water into the capsule. The bottom of the capsule<br>
carrier or of the housing is provided with means for perforating the bottom of the capsule, in order to<br>
allow coffee or some other extracted beverage to flow out from the capsule.<br>
In the known devices, different systems are available for injecting water into the capsule. Some<br>
systems include a grid provided with multiple orifices for distributing the injected water over an<br>
upper porous membrane of the capsule, such as those described in the European Application EP 0<br>
006 175. The injection heads can also be provided with multiple spikes, such as those described in<br>
the US Patent 3 607 297, for perforating a membrane closing sealingly the capsule. Tn some systems,<br>
the injection head includes one or several injection spikes, which are each provided with a water<br>
injection channel and which perforates the upper membrane of the capsule, in order to inject water<br>
directly inside the capsule, via the injection channels provided in the injection spikes. The injection<br>
heads provided with perforating means offer the advantage that they make it possible to provide the<br>
capsules with an upper sealing membrane, which does not need to be removed before use.<br>
The injection systems with a single spike and in which the water injection orifice is arranged inside<br>
the capsule, have the drawback of not distributing the injected water in a uniform manner through the<br>
product contained in the capsule and this is conducive to the formation of preferential flow channels<br>
through the substance to be extracted. The result is an extraction of the product to be extracted,<br>
which is not complete and a strong decrease of the extraction pressure inside the capsule during the<br>
process, owing to the low resistance offered by the preferential flow channels.<br>
In systems with an injection head with multiple performing spikes, such as those described in US 3<br>
327 614, EP 604 615 or EP 1 203 554, the problem of preferential channels forming is decreased by<br>
comparison with the use of a single injection spike, without however being eliminated.<br>
In all the known systems, during the extraction, the resistance to the flow of the water injected<br>
through the product contained in the capsule tends to decrease, in particular in the last phase of the<br>
extraction.<br>
In view of the drawbacks cited above, one objective of the invention is to provide a method for<br>
preparing a beverage or a liquid foodstuff, from a capsule containing a product with a substance to be<br>
extracted, which is efficient and which makes it possible to optimize the extraction of said substance.<br>
Another objective of the invention is to provide a device and a capsule containing a product with a<br>
substance to be extracted, for the preparation of a beverage or of a liquid foodstuff, which makes it<br>
possible to optimise the extraction of said substance.<br>
It is advantageous to provide a method for preparing a beverage or a liquid foodstuff and a device<br>
with a capsule for carrying out the method, which are capable of improving the taste and the texture<br>
of the beverage or of the liquid foodstuff obtained.<br>
It is advantageous to provide a method and a device with a capsule for carrying out the method, in<br>
particular for the preparation of hot coffee or chocolate, which make it possible to generate a thick<br>
froth.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for preparing a beverage or a liquid foodstuff<br>
from a capsule containing a product with a substance to be extracted, the capsule having a shell<br>
forming a rigid container and a flexible membrane closing the open side of the shell and capable of<br>
significant elastic or permanent deformation, said method comprising the steps of perforating a<br>
plurality of smooth holes distributed over the flexible membrane by means of an injection head<br>
having a perforating surface provided with a plurality of perforating spikes distributed over the<br>
perforating surface, the perforating spikes having a tapered and smooth shape without any sharp<br>
edges; and of injecting water onto the flexible membrane such that the membrane deforms in the<br>
direction of the product contained inside the capsule and the water penetrates into the capsule via the<br>
smooth holes without them tearing.<br>
The invention further provides a device for preparing a beverage or a liquid foodstuff from a capsule<br>
containing a product with a substance to be extracted, the capsule having a shell forming a rigid<br>
container and a flexible member closing the open side of the shell and capable of significant elastic<br>
or permanent deformation; said device having an injection head comprising a perforating surface<br>
having a shape which is substantially curved and convex, when viewed from outside, provided with a<br>
plurality of perforating spikes distributed over the perforating surface and at least one water supply<br>
channel opening upon the perforating surface, the perforating spikes having a smooth tapered shape<br>
without sharp edges and an average cone angle less than 60°.<br>
Advantageously, the method, the device and the capsule according to the invention<br>
make it possible to ensure a good distribution of the injected water in the capsule<br>
and to retain a counter pressure within the capsule, in order to optimise the<br>
extraction of the product to be extracted, inside the capsule.<br>
Furthermore, the method, the device and the capsule according to the invention<br>
make it possible to avoid the formation of preferential flow channels. In the case of<br>
products leaving behind spent material in the capsule, such as ground coffee, the<br>
pressure exerted by the upper membrane of the capsule against the product to be<br>
extracted, makes it possible, on the one hand, to avoid the formation of preferential<br>
flow channels and, on the other hand, to retain a counter pressure to the injection<br>
pressure, so as to ensure that the extraction proceeds during the entire extraction<br>
cycle at a high pressure, which optimises the extraction, and makes it possible to<br>
achieve a richer flavour and a more thorough extraction of the whole of the product<br>
contained in the capsule. Moreover, the high pressure applied during the entire<br>
extraction cycle makes it possible to obtain a very good froth.<br>
The recovery of the froth can be further improved by providing, on the bottom of the<br>
capsule carrier, a collector portion with a wall defining an upwards protruding orifice<br>
provided with partial outflow slots for evacuating the liquid extract, with one portion of<br>
the froth flowing through the upwards protruding orifice of the collector portion.<br>
In the case of products which do not leave behind any spent material, i. e. which are<br>
extracted completely, such as powdered chocolate or powdered milk, the method,<br>
the device and the capsule, according to the invention, enable an extraction which is<br>
complete while allowing for the formation of a good froth.<br>
Other advantageous objects and features will become apparent from the claims,<br>
from the description and from the appended drawings, in which :<br>
Fig. 1 is a cross-sectional view of a part of a device for preparing a beverage or a<br>
liquid foodstuff, showing a portion of an injection head and of a capsule carrier in<br>
which is nested a capsule filled with a product with a substance to be extracted, the<br>
injection head and the capsule carrier being in an initial position, awaiting extraction ;<br>
Fig. 2 is a view similar to Fig. 1, however with the injection head in its "ready for<br>
injection" position, i. e. pressed sealingly against the upper face of the capsule in the<br>
capsule carrier;<br>
Fig. 2a is a detailed partial view illustrating the penetration, by a perforating spike of<br>
the injection head, into a flexible membrane of the capsule ;<br>
Fig. 3 is a view similar to Fig. 2, in an early initial phase of the water injection ;<br>
Fig. 4 is a view similar to Fig. 3, in a more advanced phase of the water injection ;<br>
Fig. 5 is a cross-sectional view of an alternate version of the injection head and of<br>
the capsule; and<br>
Fig. 6 is a cross-sectional view of another alternate version of the injection head and<br>
of the capsule according to the invention.<br>
Referring to the figures, a device for preparing a beverage or a liquid foodstuff from a<br>
capsule 1 containing a product 2 with a substance to be extracted, comprises an<br>
injection head 3 and a capsule carrier 4 which can be tightly pressed against the<br>
injection head, as illustrated in figures 2 to 4, by a bayonet system or some other<br>
system. The capsule carrier 4 has a side wall 5 and an intermediate bottom wall 6,<br>
forming together an upper cavity portion 7a, into which is nested the capsule 1. The<br>
side wall 5 has a slightly conical shape which matches the also substantially conically<br>
shape of a side wall 8 of the capsule. Advantageously, the intermediate bottom wall<br>
6 can also be provided in the form of a filtering wall carrying a plurality of perforating<br>
spikes 9 and having outflow orifices 10 extending through said wall, wherein the<br>
spikes are designed for perforating the bottom wall 11 of the capsule.<br>
Advantageously, the bottom wall 11 of the capsule can have a concave shape (when<br>
viewed from outside), which bulges outwards when a certain pressure is reached in<br>
the capsule during the injection, in such a manner as to make it possible for the<br>
perforating spikes 9 to perforate the bottom wall 11 and for the extracted beverage to<br>
flow out via the outflow orifices 10 of the filtering wall 6. The liquid flows into a lower<br>
cavity portion 7b of the capsule carrier located between the intermediate bottom wall<br>
6 and a bottom wall 12.<br>
The bottom wall 12 of the capsule carrier 4 has an outflow channel 13 which is<br>
surrounded by a lip 14 protruding upwards with respect to the lowest point 15 of the<br>
bottom wall 12, wherein the lip 14 includes one or several slots 16 extending to the<br>
lowest point 15 of the lower cavity portion 7b, in order to allow a full evacuation of the<br>
liquid from the capsule carrier. The upwards protruding lip 14 makes it possible for a<br>
portion of the froth 27 floating on the surface of the liquid 28 in the lower cavity<br>
portion to enter the evacuation channel 13 and be emptied at the same time as the<br>
liquid without froth, via the upwards protruding orifice. This system makes it possible<br>
to retain a larger amount of the froth than a conventional system in which the<br>
evacuation channel has a plain orifice at the position of the lowest point.<br>
The capsule 1 includes a flexible membrane 17 welded or bonded to an annular<br>
flange section 18 extending radially from one end 19 of the side wall 8 of the capsule<br>
1. Both the flange section 18 and the welded portion of the flexible membrane 17 are<br>
held between an annular seal 20 provided on the injection head and the upper flange<br>
section 21 of the capsule carrier 4. The side wall 8 and the bottom wall 11 of the<br>
capsule are preferable provided as a single piece made by the injection moulding of<br>
a polymer, such as polypropylene or any other plastic material capable of being<br>
recycled. The side wall 8 and the bottom wall 11 form a thin shell, which is relatively<br>
rigid by comparison with the flexible membrane 17. The flexible membrane 17 is<br>
preferably also made from one or more polymers selected for their capacity to<br>
undergo significant elastic deformations and / or permanent deformations.<br>
Preferably, the flexible membrane is made of a material related or identical to that of<br>
the shell 8,11, which advantageously facilitates the recycling of the capsule.<br>
Advantageously, the flexible membrane 17 can be formed from a multiple layer<br>
sheet, such as a multiple layer polypropylene sheet, in order to improve its tensile<br>
strength and its deformability (elastic and / or permanent). This is important, in view<br>
of the fact that the membrane, subjected to the high pressure of the water injected<br>
during the extraction, deforms considerably. The multiple layer membrane can<br>
advantageously be formed with more than five layers. It was found that seven layers<br>
make it possible to achieve the elasticity characteristics and the tensile strength<br>
characteristics, which are optimal for specific applications.<br>
During the extraction, the annular flange section 18 functions as a support capable of<br>
withstanding the tensile force exerted by the membrane, non only because the flange<br>
section is highly rigid in the radial direction R, but also because the flange section is<br>
pressed and retained between the capsule carrier and the annular seal 20 of the<br>
injection head.<br>
The injection head 3 comprises a body 22 having a water supply channel 23 opening<br>
on a perforating surface 24 provided with a plurality of perforating spikes 25, which<br>
are spaced apart from one another and distributed over the perforating surface 24. In<br>
this embodiment, the water supply channel opens substantially at the centre of the<br>
perforating surface 24, but it is also possible to provide several supply channels<br>
opening at different locations on the perforating surface. The diameter of the<br>
perforating surface 24 is approximately equal to or smaller than the diameter of the<br>
flexible membrane 17 of the capsule.<br>
The perforating spikes 25 have, preferably, a conical shape, i. e. they have a cross-<br>
section, which is substantially circular. The perforating spikes could also have an<br>
elliptic cross-section or any other smooth shape (i.e. without any sharp edges),<br>
which is tapered and which ends with a perforating spike. The generator 29 of the<br>
shape of the perforating spikes is preferably a straight line, but it could also be a<br>
curved line.<br>
Advantageously, the surface without sharp edges of the perforating spikes makes it<br>
possible to obtain a hole 26 formed through the elastic membrane 17 having an edge<br>
26 (see Fig. 2a) which is smooth, even and devoid of sharply angled portions, in<br>
order to avoid a rupture of the membrane when a tensile force is applied to the<br>
same.<br>
The angle of the cone of the perforating spikes is, preferably, between 30 and 50 °.<br>
The angle of the cone and the depth of penetration of the spike into the membrane<br>
17 determine the diameter of the perforated hole 26. The depth of penetration of the<br>
perforating spikes through the membrane 17 will depend, in particular, on the<br>
resistance offered by the product 2 from within the capsule, when the injection head<br>
is in its "ready for injection" lowered position, as illustrated in Fig. 2.<br>
Accordingly, the elastic and permanent deformation properties of the membrane 17,<br>
in combination with the shape of the perforating spikes (having a smooth surface and<br>
a cone with a certain angle), make it possible to form holes 26 which have a shape<br>
making the membrane resistant to tear and of which the bigger or smaller size is<br>
dependant upon the amount of the product filling the capsule and upon the<br>
compactness thereof. Accordingly, the less the capsule is filled with a product 2, the<br>
smaller will the holes perforating the membrane be. In a situation where the product<br>
offers no counter resistance during the perforation, the diameter of the holes 26 will<br>
depend upon the shape of the perforating surface 24, the elastic and the plastic<br>
properties of the flexible membrane 17 and upon the shape of the perforating spikes.<br>
When water is injected under pressure via the supply channel 23, the flexible<br>
membrane deforms under the pressure, as is illustrated in Fig. 3, and moves away<br>
from the perforating surface 24 of the injection head. The water under pressure flows<br>
through the flexible membrane via the plurality of perforations 26 distributed over the<br>
surface of the membrane and wets the product, which is inside the capsule. The<br>
increase in the pressure in the capsule causes the wall of the bottom 11 to bulge<br>
outwards and said wall is, accordingly, projected rapidly against the perforating<br>
spikes of the filtering wall 6 and perforated, thus enabling the liquid 28 to flow into the<br>
lower cavity portion 7b, as illustrated in Fig. 4.<br>
The pressure exerted by the flexible membrane on the product inside the capsule<br>
during the extraction makes it possible for the product to remain relatively compact<br>
and prevents the formation of preferential flow channels. On the other hand, the<br>
pressure exerted by the membrane makes it also possible to ensure that the counter<br>
resistance to the flow of liquid through the product remains high during the entire<br>
extraction cycle, thus improving the wetting of the product, its extraction and the<br>
generation of froth.<br>
The extent of the deformation of the flexible membrane 17 is determined by the<br>
hydraulic pressure differential AP between the surface 7a thereof onto which the<br>
water is injected and the surface 7b thereof facing the inside of the capsule. The<br>
pressure differential AP is dependent upon the size and the number of the holes 26.<br>
The size of these holes 26 is function, amongst others, of the resistance offered by<br>
the membrane 17 to its perforation by the spikes 25. This resistance will depend, in<br>
particular, on the amount of product 2 contained in the capsule 8. This situation<br>
ensures an automatic adjustment of the compression of the product 2 contained in<br>
the capsule 8. The less product there is in the capsule, the greater will the<br>
deformation of the membrane be and the lower will the flow of water be, which also<br>
restricts the formation of preferential channels.<br>
The preferred shape of the perforating surface 24 is a convex one, as illustrated in<br>
Fig. 6, to engage with a flexible membrane 17 of the capsule, which is substantially<br>
planar. The curvature of the perforating surface 24, 24', 24" can be more or less<br>
pronounced and, in the case of the perforating surface 24" having a strong<br>
curvature, the flexible membrane could even be concave (when viewed from<br>
outside), such as indicated by the reference number 17'. The injection heads with<br>
perforating surfaces 24" with a strong curvature can be very useful, when the<br>
capsule 1 is filled with a small amount of product, as the case may arise with tea.<br>
The perforating surface can also have a shape which is concave (when viewed from<br>
outside) 24'", in the case where the capsules are filled entirely and the flexible<br>
membrane 17" has a convex shape (when viewed from outside). In this case, the<br>
flexible membrane 17" itself can even be semi-rigid and shaped by thermoforming,<br>
owing to the fact that it is not subjected to a tensile deformation in an initial phase of<br>
extraction or exhibit no rigidity at all, if the compressed spent material remaining in<br>
the capsule has a volume greater than the volume defined by the shell of the capsule<br>
and the membrane in the "concave" position (symmetrical with respect to the<br>
"convex" position).<br>

portion (7b) being arranged between the filtering wall (6) and the bottom wall (12), the bottom wall<br>
comprising an outflow channel (13) surrounded by lips (14) which protrude upwards with respect to<br>
the lowest point (15) of the lower cavity portion (7b).<br>
14. A device as claimed in the preceding claim, wherein the upwards protruding lips (14) have<br>
openings (16) in the form of slots or of holes enabling the liquid, at the lowest point, to flow out from<br>
the capsule carrier.<br>
15. A device as claimed in any of claims 9 to 14, wherein the shell (8, 11) of the capsule has an<br>
annular flange section (18) extending substantially in a radial plane R from the side wall (8) of the<br>
shell to which the flexible membrane (17) bonded or welded, the flexible membrane and the shell<br>
being made from one or several polymers and the flexible membrane being made from a multiple<br>
layer sheet.<br>
16. A device as claimed in the preceding claim, wherein the shell and the membrane are made<br>
from polypropylene.<br>
17. A device as claimed in any of the preceding claims, wherein the flexible membrane is made<br>
from a sheet comprised of at least five layers.<br>
18. A device as claimed in any of claims 15 to 17, wherein the flexible membrane (17) has a<br>
shape, which is substantially planar, before the use of the capsule.<br>
19. A device as claimed in any of claims 15 to 18, wherein the side wall (8) of the shell of the<br>
capsule has a shape, which is substantially conical, whereby the diameter of the cone decreases from<br>
the annular flange section (18) in the direction of the bottom wall (11) of the shell.<br>
There is disclosed a method for preparing a beverage or a liquid foodstuff from a capsule<br>
containing a product with a substance to be extracted, the capsule having a shell (8, 11) forming a<br>
rigid container and a flexible membrane (17) closing the open side of the shell and capable of<br>
significant elastic or permanent deformation, involving the steps of perforating a plurality of smooth<br>
holes (26) distributed over the flexible membrane by means of an injection head (3) having a<br>
perforating surface (24) provided with a plurality of perforating spikes (25) distributed over the<br>
perforating surface, the perforating spikes having a tapered and smooth shape without any sharp<br>
edges; and of injecting water onto the flexible membrane such that the membrane deforms in the<br>
direction of the product contained inside the capsule and the water penetrates into the capsule via the<br>
smooth holes without them tearing.</td>
