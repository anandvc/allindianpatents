The present invention relates to oral care compositions, such as dentrifice formulations. Dentrifice formulations typically contain substantial amounts of humectants. Humectants help the formulation retain its moisture, thus, preventing the formulation from hardening when the container cap is left open for extended periods. Typical humectants employed in such formulations are glycerol, sorbitol which are usually the preferred humectants because of their sweet taste. Other humectants which are also used are polyethylene glycols of low molecular weight typically between 200 - 600, Liquid polyethylene glycols constitute an excellent choice as a carrier for formulating a non-aqueous, dentrifice formulation since they come with several advantages such as good hygroscopicity, low viscosity, good compatibility with several dentrifice ingredients, low volatility, low cost, low toxicity, low odor and low pour point. More recently, toothpaste compositions are being formulated without any significant incorporation of water. Examples of such toothpaste compositions are those that cannot tolerate the presence of significant levels of water due to concerns related to decomposition of key ingredients leading to loss of activity, or reactivity of ingredients, for example, baking soda and a peroxygen compound such as, hydrogen peroxide or sodium percarbonate. The formulation and increased stability of such toothpaste compositions is achieved by employing a non-aqueous carrier typically selected from low molecular weight liquid polyethylene glycols. Dentrifice formulations also contain an anionic surfactant,<br>
typically selected from sulfate esters of C10.18 alcohols. An example of such a anionic surfactant is sodium lauryl sulfate. The primary function of the anionic surfactant is to provide efficient foaming action during brushing. However, in many instances the foaming action provided by the anionic surfactant alone is inadequate and often additional ingredients have to be added in combination with the anionic surfactant to achieve the desired foam profile during brushing. A common ingredient that is typically selected to achieve additional foam boosting are the high molecular weight, solid block copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide. Examples of such solid block copolymers are those that have a number average molecular weight over 8000 and also contain at least 50% ethylene oxide. Particularly preferred are those that contain between 70% - 80% ethylene oxide and have a number average molecular weight greater than 9000.<br>
Further, a limitation also exists with the use of the high molecular weight, solid, block copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide in a non-aqueous dentrifice formulation because they are insoluble in the liquid polyalkylene glycol carrier. Dissolution of the solid block copolymer in the liquid polyalkylene glycol carrier is achieved by heating the two components until a single clear phase is achieved. Unfortunately, upon cooling back to ambient temperatures, the solid block copolymer has a tendency to phase separate leading to the formation of a heterogenous mixture. The formation of a heterogenous phase is particularly problematic since it may lead to a preferential partitioning of certain dentrifice components in any one phase and an altering of the homogenity of the formulation. This altering of the homogenity of the formulation is particularly noticeable when the dentrifice formulation undergoes multiple heating and cooling cycles during transportation and storage.<br>
The Applicants have solved these aforementioned problems in the art. Surprisingly, Applicants have discovered that if the solid block copolymers are rendered liquid during their preparation, by addition of small amounts of a C3 or higher alkylene oxide to the crystalline, hydrophilic portion of the solid block copoiymerto produce a liquid<br>
polyoxyalkylene compound of similar hydrophilicity and molecular weight, then a single, clear, homogenous phase is achieved upon adding to the liquid, polyoxyalkylene glycol carrier. An additional advantage with the use of the high molecular weight liquid polyoxyalkylene compound of this invention is that upon addition to the polyalkylene glycol carrier, they are readily miscible and form a clear, homogenous, single phase composition, and do not have to be heated to achieve dissolution.<br>

Description of the Method of Preparation of the Liquid Polyalkylene Glycol Carrier and Liquid Polyoxyalkylene Compound Miscible in Said Liquid Polyalkylene Glycol Carrier of the Present Invention<br>
Preparation Of the Liquid Polyoxyalkylene Compound of the Invention<br>
The liquid polyoxyalkylene compound of the invention was prepared by conventional techniques in 1 or 2 gallon stainless steel autoclaves that were equipped with stirring, pressure gauge, thermocouple and addition tube. For instance, an initiator, in all cases propylene glycol, and catalyst were vacuum stripped in a stainless steel stirred autoclave at 120 °C to remove water. The formation of a alkylene oxide block was achieved by the addition of propylene oxide at 105 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere with addition rates set such that the overall pressure does not exceed 90 psig. To the polyoxypropylene block was added a mixture of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide to form a mixed oxide hydrophilic block. Mixed oxide additions were carried out at 135 °C with the same pressure constraints as above. The final products were neutralized by addition of 85% phosphoric acid and inhibited by addition of 100 ppm t-butylhydroxytoluene.<br>
Preparation of the Liquid Polyalkylene Glycol Carrier of the Invention<br>
A two gallon stainless steel autoclave was charged with 1089 g of propylene glycol, 46.6 g of 45% potassium hydroxide and purged with nitrogen. The contents were heated to 80°C and stripped to remove volatiles for 2 hours. The contents were heated to 130°C and 4412.9 g of Ethylene oxide added over a period of six hours. After the addition was finished the mixture was kept at 130°C for one hour and then volatiles stripped for 1/2 hour.<br>
A five gallon stainless steel autoclave was charged with 3075.6 g of the above material arid purged with nitrogen. The material was heated to 116°C and 11,168 g of a mixture of 76.8% Ethylene Oxide and 23.2% Propylene Oxide added over a period of 9.5 hours. After the addition was complete, the mixture was kept at 116°C for an additional two hours. A final charge of 1762 g of Ethylene Oxide was added over two hours and then kept at 116°C for 2.5 hours. The mixture was stripped for 1/2 hour, cooled to 80°C and 30.1 g of 50% Hypophosphorous acid added. The mixture was agitated for 1/2 hour m the autoclave and then discharged.<br>
The Utility of the Present Invention<br>
In order to illustrate the utility of the present invention, Applicants prepared binary blends comprising a liquid polyalkylene glycol and a high molecular weight, solid block copolymer with a molecular weight greater than 8000. Said binary blends were then compared to blends of the present invention comprising Compound A of Formula II (liquid) and Compound B of Formula I (liquid). See Table-1<br><br>
r<br>
The binary (solid /liquid) blends were prepared by first mixing the solid block copolyme with the liquid polyalkylene glycol and then heating the blend above the melting point of the solid block copolymer to obtain a clear, single phase composition. The resulting clear composition was then gradually allowed to cool to ambient temperatures while being continually stirred at 100 rpm on a LIGHTNIN mixer. The final composition was<br>
then stored at ambient temperatures and physical stability of the composition was<br>
noted.<br>
The binary (liquid/liquid) blends of the present invention were prepared by simply mixing the components (a) liquid polyalkylene glycol carrier, and (b) liquid polyalkylene compound as defined hereinabove.<br>
As the Table 1 indicates, all blends comprising a liquid, polyethylene glycol of molecular weight 400 and the solid, block copolymer were unstable on storage and separated into two phases. This is particularly evident when the samples are stored at 45°C. Clearly, Test 8 and 9 (the present invention) illustrates the utility of the present invention in maintaining the stability and uniformity of dentrifice formulations<br>
However, when the solid block copolymer was replaced with the liquid polyoxyalkyiene compound of Formula II (Compound A), then solubility was instantaneous and the resulting composition was a single phase, clear, stable, homogenous liquid. The table further shows that when the liquid, polyethylene glycol of molecular weight 400 is replaced with the liquid polyalkylene glycol of Formula I (Compound B), a clear, single phase, stable, homogenous composition is achieved upon blending with the liquid polyoxyalkyiene compound of Formula II (Compound A).<br>
(Table  Removed)<br>
In each blend, the weight ratio of the liquid polyalkylene glycol to the solid block copolymer or Component B was 90:10.<br>

Preparation of Dentrifice Compositions Containing the Liquid Polyalkylene Glycol Carrier and Liquid Polyoxyalkylene Compound Miscible in Said Liquid Polyalkylene Glycol Carrier of the Present invention<br>
The liquid polyalkylene glycol carrier and liquid polyoxyalkylene compound miscibie in said liquid polyalkylene glycol carrier of the present invention are present in dentrifice compositions at a preferred level of 1 - 99%, more preferably at a level of 20 - 79%; most preferably at a level of 30 - 50% by weight of the dentrifice composition.<br>
Generally, the level of incorporation depends on the end use of the liquid polyalkylene compound of the invention. If they function as carriers, for example, in a essentially non-aqueous dentrifice formulation, then higher use levels are required in the<br>
formulation.<br>
Dentrifice formulations also contain other ingredients such as surfactants selected from anionic surfactants which include sodium lauryl sulphate; sodium alkyl glyceryl ether sutfonate; alkyl benzene sulfonates. Other anionic surfactants also include oxyalkyiates of C6 - C18 alcohols. It is also known to those skilled in the art to use solid block copolymers of polyoxyethylene and polyoxypropylene to further provide a boost in the foaming performance of the dentrifice composition. Such solid block copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide are excluded from the scope of this invention, Further, small amounts of cationic surfactants, having a quaternary nitrogen, which show compatibility with the nonionic carrier blends of this invention can also be used. Various other materials may also be used in the formulating of personal care products. For example, peroxygen compounds such as hydrogen peroxide, sodium percarbonate, can be used in such dentrifice compositions. Dental abrasives consisting of finely divided silica, or calcium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, calcium pyrophosphate, and h yd rated alumina are added for polishing performance. Additionally, thickening agents such as collodial silica, xanthan gum, gum arabic, hydroxyethyicellulose, poiyvmylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth, carragennan can also be used to provide sufficient thickening consistency to the formulation. Also, flavoring agents such as peppermint, spearmint oils or preservatives, opacifying agents, buffer salts, sweeteners, anti-bacterial agents anti-calculus agents or anti-plaque agents, anti-inflammatory agents, anti-caries agents such as the fluoride salts can also be included in smal! amounts. Polymeric agents which accelerate the transport of active materials can also be included. Additionally, dentifrice compositions may contain small amounts of water.<br>
