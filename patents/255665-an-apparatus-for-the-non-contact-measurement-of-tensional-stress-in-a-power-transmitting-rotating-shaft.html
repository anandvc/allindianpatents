LASER SENSOR APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR DETECTING<br>
TRANSMISSION SHAFT TORQUE<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]	This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application<br>
No. 60/883,244, filed January 3, 2007 entitled "LASER TORQUE SENSOR FOR<br>
TRANSMISSIONS" and which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002]	The present invention is directed to a sensor or apparatus for the non-<br>
contact measurement of torsional stress in a power transmitting rotating shaft, one such<br>
example being the input or output shaft of a transmission, by measuring changes in at<br>
least one property of light transmitted along the shaft to determine the torque transmitted<br>
by the shaft.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]	When torque is applied to a shaft, stress is applied along helical lines of<br>
compression and tension along the surface of the shaft. Various methods are known for<br>
measurement of the torque in a shaft. One method is to bond strain gauges to the exterior<br>
surface of the shaft with the strain gauges positioned in a cross configuration. The strain<br>
gauges function as elements of a resistive bridge circuit measuring compression and<br>
tension in the shaft surface along their length as the shaft torsionally twists. Torque<br>
measurement in a rotating shaft can be a challenge to implement when using strain<br>
gauges as the sensing elements as the strain gauges necessarily need to interface<br>
electrically with other off-shaft electronics. The off-shaft electronics are necessary to<br>
perform the resistance bridge measurements so as to detect and quantify tension and<br>
compression resulting from torsional twisting of the shaft as indicative of transmitted<br>
shaft torque.<br><br>
P000011-PTT-DLT<br>
2<br>
[0004]	Transmitted torque in a shaft may also be determined by measurement of<br>
the angular displacement between two gears mounted to the shaft in a distally spaced<br>
relationship along the axis of rotation of the shaft. Using this method, the angular<br>
displacement between spaced gears is indicative of the twist angle over the length of the<br>
shaft between the gears, the twist angle being indicative of torque transmitted along the<br>
shaft.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005]	The present invention is directed to a non-contact sensor or apparatus for<br>
measuring the instantaneous torque, or torsional stress/strain, transmitted through an<br>
elongated power transmission member such as a rotatable shaft, such as (for example) a<br>
shaft driveably coupling an engine to a vehicle transmission, or within the transmission,<br>
or elsewhere within a vehicle drivetrain. In accordance with the disclosed invention, a<br>
rotatablc shaft is provided with a cavity in a portion of a length of the shaft between a<br>
first portion of the shaft and a second portion of the shaft. A light source is provided<br>
emitting polarized light along a measurement light path in the cavity from the first<br>
portion of the shaft to the second portion of the shaft. A polarizing filter is provided and<br>
secured in the cavity in the second portion of the shaft. The polarizing filter is operable to<br>
change the angular polarization of light in the polarized light beam. A measurement<br>
device is provided to detect the change in the polarization angle in the light path as<br>
introduced by the polarizing filter. When torque is transmitted by the shaft, the<br>
transmitted torque causes elastic twisting in the shaft about the axis of rotation of the<br>
shaft. The torsional twisting of the shaft results in an angular rotation of the polarizing<br>
filter relative to the polarization direction of the polarized light beam and thereby results<br>
in a change in polarization angle of the light passing through the polarizing filter. This<br>
change in polarization angle is detected and is indicative of transmitted torque in the<br>
shaft, providing the basis by which the transmitted torque in the shaft may be calculated,<br>
as will be discussed more fully in later sections herein.<br><br>
P000011-PTT-DLT<br>
(0006]	According to one aspect of the invention, the light source is a laser light<br>
source, the light source includes a light-polarizing filter to provide a coherent single<br>
wavelength polarized light beam to transmit along the measurement light path.<br>
|0007]	According to another aspect of the invention, the torque sensor apparatus<br>
includes a beam splitter configured to split the light beam from the light source into two<br>
light beams, one following the measurement light path and one following a reference<br>
light path. The beam splitter provides a reference light path having an angular<br>
polarization determined by angular polarization of light from the light source. In this<br>
aspect of the invention the measurement device detects the change in polarization angle<br>
as a detected difference in the angular polarization of the reference light path and angular<br>
polarization of the light after the polarizing filter. The detected difference in angular<br>
polarization is indicative of the torsional twisting in the shaft and therefore the torque<br>
transmitted by the shaft.<br>
[0008]	According to another aspect of the invention, the light source in the torque<br>
sensor apparatus is a laser light source that includes a second light-polarizing filter to<br>
polarize light emitted by the light source. The light source is positioned external to the<br>
shaft rather than within the cavity of the shaft. Polarized light from the second polarizing<br>
filter is directed to enter the shaft cavity through an entrance aperture in the first portion<br>
of the shall. The entrance aperture extends through the wall of the shaft between the<br>
cavity and the outside surface of the shaft. The torque sensor apparatus further includes a<br>
first reflectance element secured within the first portion of the shaft cavity and configured<br>
to redirect the polarized light from the entrance aperture in a direction so as to intercept<br>
the polarization filter provided in the cavity in the second portion of the shaft cavity. A<br>
second rellectance element is also secured within the shaft cavity and configured to<br>
redirect polarized light leaving the polarization filter in the cavity to exit the shaft through<br>
an exit aperture in the shaft. The measurement device is positioned outside the shaft and<br>
is aligned to detect polarized light emitted through the exit aperture. The entrance<br>
aperture and the exit aperture are aligned on the shaft to permit light from the light source<br>
mounted external to the shaft to redirect through the cavity and reach the measurement<br>
device when the shaft is in at least one angular position of shaft rotation.<br><br>
P000011-PTT-DLT<br>
4<br>
[0009]	According to another aspect of the invention, the first reflectance element<br>
includes a first metallic tube into which the first reflectance element is mounted.<br>
Similarly, the second reflectance element includes a second metallic tube into which the<br>
second reflectance element is mounted. The first and second metallic tubes arc sized and<br>
fitted to secure to the shaft within the cavity of the shaft.<br>
[0010]	According to another aspect of the invention, the shaft cavity is a portion<br>
of an axial bore through one end of the shaft, the axial bore providing access to the cavity<br>
for installation of the first reflectance element and the second reflectance element through<br>
the end bore of the shaft.<br>
[0011]	According to another aspect of the invention, the first reflectance element<br>
includes a first reflective surface configured to redirect the polarized light from the<br>
entrance aperture by reflection along a length of the shaft cavity to the polarization filter<br>
in the shaft cavity. The second reflectance element includes a second reflective surface<br>
configured to redirect the polarized light from the polarization filter in the cavity to exit<br>
the shaft cavity through an exit aperture in the shaft by reflection.<br>
|0012]	According to another aspect of the invention, the reflective surfaces of the<br>
first and second reflectance elements are substantially planar reflective surfaces.<br>
[0013]	According to another aspect of the invention, the reflective surfaces of<br>
both the first and second reflectance elements are each a conical reflective surface.<br>
[0014]	According to another aspect of the invention, a half wave plate is provided<br>
and positioned after the light source and the second polarizing filter and before the beam<br>
splitter. The effect of the half wave plate yields a doubling in the sensitivity of the<br>
measurement device in detecting shaft torque, as will be explained more fully later.<br>
|0015]	According to another aspect of the invention, the change in polarization<br>
angle of light leaving the polarization filter located in the shaft cavity results in a change<br>
in the intensity of light exiting the exit aperture of the shaft and reaching the<br>
measurement device. In this aspect of the invention, the measurement device is<br>
configured and adapted to detect and utilize this change in light intensity to determine the<br>
change in polarization angle of light reaching the measurement device from the shaft exit<br>
aperture. Additionally, the measurement device is configured to detect changes in the<br><br>
P000011-PTT-DLT<br>
5<br>
intensity of light in the reference light path and correct the measured intensity of light<br>
from the shaft exit aperture according to measured changes in reference light path<br>
intensity to cancel out variations in the intensity of light emitted by the light source.<br>
[0016]	Additionally, a method is disclosed for the measurement of torque<br>
transmitted by a shaft in accordance with the foregoing apparatus of the invention, as will<br>
be explained more fully later herein.<br>
[0017]	The above features and advantages and other features and advantages of<br>
the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the<br>
best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0028]	Figure 1 illustrates a schematic side perspective view of one embodiment<br>
of a laser torque sensor 10 applied to measure instantaneous torque, or torsional<br>
slress/strain transmitted by a rotatable shaft 12. In accordance with the disclosed<br>
invention, the rotatable shaft 12 is provided with a cavity 14 in a portion of a length of<br>
the shaft between a first portion 20 of the shaft 12 and a second portion 22 of the shaft 12.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment, the cavity 14 is a portion of the axial bore 62 in the shaft<br>
12. The laser torque sensor 10 further includes a first reflectance element 38 and second<br>
reflectance element 42 each secured into the cavity 14 in the shaft 12. The reflectance<br>
elements 38, 42 are installable into the cavity 14 of the shaft 12 through the opening of<br>
the bore 62 provided on a first end 66 of the shaft 12. The first reflectance element 38 is<br><br>
P000011-PTT-DLT<br>
7<br>
secured in the cavity 14 at a first portion 20 of the shaft 12 while the second reflectance<br>
element 42 is secured in the cavity 14 in a second portion 22 of the shaft 12 where the<br>
second portion 22 is spaced apart from the first portion 20 by some defined distance. The<br>
shaft 12 includes a light entrance aperture 16 in the first portion 20 of the shaft 12 and a<br>
light exit aperture 18 in the second portion 22 of the shaft 12. Each aperture 16, 18<br>
extends from an outside surface 70 of the shaft 12 into the cavity 14 of the shaft 12. In<br>
the embodiment illustrated in Figure 1, the first reflectance element 38 and second<br>
reflectance element 42 each have a generally 'C' shaped housing. The use of a 'C' shaped<br>
housing is specific to exemplary embodiment of Figure 1 and is not limiting. The<br>
reflectance elements 38, 42 may include any shape of housing or alternately no housing<br>
at all as long as the reflectance elements 38, 42 are securable to the shaft 12 within the<br>
cavity 14. The 'C shaped housing of the first reflectance element 38 is secured into the<br>
cavity 14 with the opening 68 of the 'C aligned with the light entrance aperture 16 of<br>
shaft 12. Similarly, the 'C' shaped housing of the second reflectance element 42 is<br>
secured into the cavity 14 with the opening 72 of the 'C' aligned with the light exit<br>
aperture 18.<br>
[0029]	The laser torque sensor 10 includes a light source 24 emitting light along a<br>
first light path 30. In Figure 1, the light source 24 is secured proximate to and separate<br>
from the shaft 12 such that the shaft 12 is free to rotate about an axis of rotation 48<br>
independent of light source 24. The laser torque sensor includes a polarizing filter 26<br>
positioned proximate to the light source 24. In certain embodiments of the light source<br>
24, the polarizing filter 26 may be included as part of the light source 24. The polarizing<br>
filter 26 is positioned to intercept the first light path 30 emitted by light source 24 and to<br>
polarize the light leaving the polarizing filter 26 along the polarized portion 74 of the' first<br>
light path 30 in an angular direction of a first axis of polarization 28. The laser torque<br>
sensor 10 further includes a beam splitter 32, such as (for one non-limiting example) a<br>
light-transparent planar plate with a partially reflective mirror-like coating. The beam<br>
splitter 32 is adapted to transmit a defined percentage of the light incident upon the beam<br>
splitter 32 into a first measurement light path 34 and to reflect substantially the remaining<br>
percentage of incident light along a reference light path 36. The first measurement light<br><br>
P000011-PTT-DLT<br>
8<br>
path 34 is positioned and directed towards the shaft 12 so as to be alignable with the<br>
entrance aperture 16 by rotation of the shaft 12 about the axis of rotation 48, wherein the<br>
first measurement light path 34 enters the cavity 14 through the light entrance aperture<br>
16. In the first portion 20 of the shaft 12, the first reflectance element 38 includes a first<br>
reflective surface 40 configured to reflect polarized light in the first measurement light<br>
path 34 to a second measurement light path 46 directed along a length of the cavity 14 in<br>
a direction substantially parallel to the axis of rotation 48 of the shaft 12 so as to impinge<br>
upon the second reflective surface 44 of second reflectance element 42 secured in the<br>
second portion 22 of the shaft 12. The laser torque sensor 10 additionally includes a<br>
polarizing filter 52 positioned in the second portion 22 of the shaft 12 and secured to the<br>
'C shaped housing of the second reflectance element 42. Again, the 'C shape of the<br>
housing is specific to the exemplary embodiment illustrated in Figure 1 and is not<br>
limiting, as discussed earlier. The polarizing filter 52 is positioned to intercept polarized<br>
light in the second measurement light path 46 before it reaches the second reflective<br>
surface 44. As the polarizing filter 52 is secured to the second reflectance element 42<br>
which is then secured within the second portion 42 of the shaft 12, the polarizing filter 52<br>
is thereby constrained to rotate in unison with the second portion 22 of shaft 12. The<br>
polarizing filter 52 has a second axis of polarization 54 by which it polarizes light in the<br>
second measurement light path 46 passing through the polarizing filter 52. The second<br>
reflectance surface 44 is configured to reflect light polarized by the polarization filter 52<br>
along a third measurement light path 50 which exits the shaft 12 through the light exit<br>
aperture I 8. The exit aperture 18 is positioned and configured to align the third<br>
measurement light path 50 with a measurement light-sensing portion 76 of a<br>
measurement device 56 by rotation of the shaft 12 about the axis of rotation 48. The exit<br>
aperture 18 and entrance aperture 16 are cooperatively aligned such that when the<br>
entrance aperture 16 is rotatably aligned to permit light in the first measurement light<br>
path 34 to enter the entrance aperture 16, then also the exit aperture 18 is aligned to<br>
permit light in the third measurement light path 50 to reach the measurement light<br>
sensing portion 76 of the measurement device 56 so that light can complete the<br>
measurement circuit from the light source 24 through the shaft cavity 14 to the<br><br>
P000011-PTT-DLT<br>
9<br>
measurement device 56. Similarly, light from the reference light path 36 impinges upon<br>
the reference light-sensing portion 78 of the measurement device 56. The measurement<br>
device 56 is positioned to receive light from the third measurement light path 50 and to<br>
detect a difference in polarization angle of the light between the third measurement path<br>
50 and the reference light path 36. Torque transmitted by the shaft 12 results in angular<br>
twisting of the shaft 12, which results in a change in the polarization angle of light in the<br>
third measurement path 50 induced by to the angular alignment of the axis of polarization<br>
54 of the second polarizing filter 52. Torsional twisting in the shaft 12 is detected as a<br>
difference in polarization angle between the reference light path 36 and the third<br>
measurement light path 50 by the measurement device 56. This change in polarization<br>
angle is directly related to the torque transmitted by the shaft 12, as will be discussed in<br>
detail in a later portion of this application. The measured torque, determined from the<br>
measured difference in polarization angle, is output as an electronic measurement signal<br>
80. The electronic measurement signal 80 may be any of: a digital electronic signal<br>
representing torque, an analog voltage signal representing torque, an analog current<br>
signal representing torque, as well as other signal output types as would be known to one<br>
skilled in the art. The torque signal may be presented in a human readable form by. for<br>
example, an analog or digital torque indicator 82, or provided as an input to an on-board<br>
vehicle engine management or transmission management computer, as well as provided<br>
as an input to other devices or for other uses as would be known to one skilled in the art.<br>
The light source 24 is preferably a laser light source.<br>
[0030]	It is to be understood that the cavity 14 may occupy only a portion of the<br>
length of the shaft 12, the cavity 14 providing space within the shaft 12 to hold<br>
reflectance elements 38, 42. Additionally, the presence in the shaft 12 of the cavity 14 in<br>
the illustrated embodiment as well as in other embodiments necessarily reduces the<br>
material cross section of the shaft 12 around the cavity 14, making the cavity portion of<br>
the shall 14 more susceptible to torsional twisting and thereby improving the accuracy<br>
and sensitivity of shaft torque measurements.<br>
[0031]	Figure 2 illustrates a schematic view of the components of the laser torque<br>
sensor of Figure 1 applied to a tubular shaft wherein the cavity 114 extends completely<br><br>
P000011-PTT-DLT<br>
10<br>
through the length of the shaft 112. As in Figure 1, the laser torque sensor 110 includes<br>
the light source 24, polarizing filter 26, beam splitter 32, light entrance aperture 116, light<br>
exit aperture 118, first reflectance element 38 secured within the first portion 120 of the<br>
shaft 112, second reflectance element 42 secured within the second portion 122 of the<br>
shaft 112, polarizing filter 52, and measurement device 56 configured to provide a<br>
measured torque signal 80 as an output. Figure 2 provides a better illustration of the<br>
preferred mounting of the second polarizing filter 52 secured immediately in front of the<br>
reflective surface 44 of the second reflectance element 42 within the second portion 122<br>
of the shaft. The measurement device 56 is configured to measure torsional twisting of<br>
the shaft 112 substantially over the length L between the first portion 120 and the second<br>
portion 122 of the shaft. This measured angular twist is converted to a shaft torque<br>
measurement, as will be discussed later in this application. Other than noted above, the<br>
operation of laser torque sensor 110 is identical to previous laser torque sensor<br>
discussions presented with Figure 1.<br>
[0032] Figure 3 illustrates a schematic sectional view of yet another embodiment of<br>
a laser torque sensor 210 applied to measure transmitted torque in a shaft 212 in which<br>
the reflectance elements 238, 242 have light reflective surfaces 84, 86 respectively. The<br>
reflectance elements 238, 242 may be made of a plastic or metallic material. In one<br>
embodiment, the light reflective surfaces 84, 86 arc cone shaped surfaces machined,<br>
formed or otherwise disposed onto reflectance elements 238, 242. In another<br>
embodiment the reflective surfaces 84, 86 each consist of two angled planar surfaces<br>
having a triangular profile when viewed from a side as depicted in Figure 3. In yet<br>
another embodiment, the reflective surfaces 84, 86 each consist of four angled planar<br>
surfaces forming a pyramid shape and having a side profile as shown in Figure 3. In all<br>
cases, the reflective surfaces 84, 86 are angled substantially at 45 degrees relative to the<br>
axis of rotation 248 of the shaft 212 such that the angle θ1 between the first<br>
measurement light path 234 and the reflected second measurement light path 246 is<br>
substantially 90 degrees. The same angular relationship also existing between the<br>
second measurement light path 246 and the third measurement light path 250. As<br>
discussed earlier with Figure 2, the measured angular twist of the shaft 212 occurs over<br><br>
P000011-PTT-DLT<br>
11<br>
the length L between the first portion 220 and second portion 222 of the shaft 212. As<br>
discussed with Figures 1 and 2, laser torque sensor 210 includes light source 24,<br>
polarizing filter 26, beam splitter 32, light entrance apertures 216, 217, light exit<br>
apertures 218, 219, polarizing filter 252 and measurement device 56 configured and<br>
adapted to provide a measured torque signal 80 as an output. The use of reflective<br>
surfaces 84, 86 having a triangular profile is particularly useful when the shaft 212 is<br>
provided with one pair of light entrance/exit apertures 216, 218 respectively, or with two<br>
opposing pairs of light entrance/exit apertures (216, 217) and (218, 219) respectively.<br>
Similarly, the use of reflective surfaces 84 having a pyramid shape with four angled<br>
planar surfaces each is particularly useful when the shaft 212 is provided with up to four<br>
pairs of light entrance/exit apertures (not shown) in which neighboring aperture pairs arc<br>
provided at positions located 90 degrees apart radially about the circumference of the<br>
shaft 212. When the reflective surfaces 84, 86 are cone shaped, they are suitable for use<br>
in shafts having any number of entrance apertures (not shown) and exit apertures (not<br>
shown).<br>
[0033]	Figure 4 illustrates a schematic view of the laser torque sensor 110 of<br>
Figure 2 further including a half wave plate 64 positioned between the polarizing filler<br>
26 and the beam splitter 32. The half wave plate 64 effectively doubles the sensitivity<br>
of the measurement device 56 to the detection of angular twisting in the shaft 112 over<br>
the length L. This can be illustrated as follows. In the laser torque sensor 110 of Figure<br>
2, a torsional angular twist in the shaft over the length L of θT degrees (sec Figure 7A)<br>
results in a difference in polarization angle between the reference light path 336 and the<br>
third measurement light path 350 of θT degrees. Providing a the half wave plate 64<br>
between the polarization filter 26 and the beam splitter 32 has the effect that a torsional<br>
angular twist in the shaft 112 over the length L of ΘT degrees now results in a<br>
difference in polarization angle between the reference light path 336 and the third<br>
measurement light path 350 of 2 ΘT degrees, exactly twice the actual angular twist of<br>
the shaft. The half wave plate 64 may be included as discussed above in any laser<br>
torque sensor embodiment of the present invention to improve torque measurement<br><br>
P000011-PTT-DLT<br>
12<br>
sensitivity. Other than noted above, the operation of laser torque sensor 110 of Figure 4<br>
is identical to the previous laser torque sensor discussions presented with Figure 1.<br>
[0034]	While Figure 3 depicts only two entrance apertures 216, 217 and two exit<br>
apertures 218, 219, it is to be understood that it is intended and in certain cases<br>
advantageous to have multiple entrance and exit apertures positioned in a band about the<br>
circumference of the shaft 212. For example, Figure 5 illustrates a schematic section view<br>
cut through the shaft 212 of Figure 3 depicting one exemplary arrangement having lour<br>
apertures 88 distributed about the circumference of the shaft 212, where the illustrated<br>
aperture 88 positions radially about the shaft 212 are indicative of the angular positions of<br>
light entrance and light exit apertures. As noted above, the use of multiple pairs of light<br>
entrance and exit apertures are considered to be advantageous. For example, the use of<br>
four pairs of apertures permits light to be conducted through the shaft 212 when the shaft<br>
212 is at any one of four positions of shaft rotation, thereby permitting four<br>
measurements of shaft twist angle to be performed in each complete rotation of the shaft<br>
212.<br>
|0035]	Figure 6 is a graph illustrating the general relationship between the twist<br>
angle ΘT(See Figure 7A) and the normalized intensity of the light passing through the<br>
polarizing (liter 52 (see Figure 1). It is assumed in Figure 6 that when the twist angle θT<br>
is 0 degrees, then the polarization of light in measurement light paths 34, 46 (see Figure<br>
1) match the axis of polarization 54 (see Figure 1) of the polarizing filter 52 (see Figure<br>
1). Figure 7a illustrates a twist angle range of-90 to 0 degrees, although it is to be<br>
understood that the sign of the twist angle indicates the direction of the torque, which can<br>
be positive or negative. The magnitude of the twist angle is indicative of the unsigned<br>
magnitude of the applied torque according to the equations provided above. It is to be<br>
understood that for positive twist angles, the twist angle vs. normalized intensity curve is<br>
the same general curve as illustrated in Figure 6 mirrored about the twist angle 0 axis.<br>
[0036]	Figures 7A and 7B serve to further illustrate the twist angle induced into<br>
the shaft 412 by an applied torque T, and the relationship between the twist angle θT and<br>
the applied torque T. An understanding of this relationship is important in converting the<br>
measured shaft twist angle so as to arrive at the torque applied to the shaft. The shaft 412<br><br>
P000011-PTT-DLT<br>
13<br>
in Figures 7 A and 7B is provided with at least two spaced apertures 88 such as light<br>
entrance and exit apertures discussed in various embodiments earlier. In Figure 7A either<br>
aperture 88 is operable as either a light entrance or light exit aperture. To facilitate<br>
discussion of the concepts, one end of the shaft 412 is depicted as connected to ground 90<br>
so as to resist rotation while a torque T is applied to the opposing end of the shaft 412.<br>
The torque T produces a torsional twisting in the shaft 412 in the cylindrical section of<br>
the shaft between the spaced apertures 88. Each aperture 88 has an axis depicted as 92, 94<br>
extending through the center of the aperture 88 and intersecting the axis of rotation 448<br>
of the shaft 412. In Figure 7A the axis 94 is also translated or copied to the aperture 88<br>
near the applied torque T as axis 194 for easy angular comparison with the axis 94. In the<br>
embodiment illustrated in Figure 7A, when no torque is applied to the shaft 412, the twist<br>
angle between axes 194 and 94 is zero. As torque T is applied to the shaft 412 in<br>
increasing magnitude, the twist angle θT increases in proportion to the applied torque.<br>
[0037]	The observed twist angle ΘT(shown as 0 in equation 1 below) is related to<br>
the rigidity modulus G, the distance L between the light entrance/exit holes, the moment<br>
of inertia .1 of the cylindrical shaft section and the applied torque T by the following<br>
equation.<br><br>
where re and ri are defined in Figure 7B, ri being the inside radius of the bore or cavity<br>
414, and re being the outside radius of the shaft 412 measured from the outside surface<br>
470 of the shaft to the center of the shaft.<br>
[0039]	Then the torque is related to the shaft twist angle θT by the following<br>
equation:<br><br>
P000011-PTT-DLT<br>
14<br><br>
[0040]	Referring again to Figures 1 and 7a. The polarization of light paths 34, 46,<br>
50 and 36 are all the same when no torque is applied to the shaft (torque as discussed and<br>
illustrated with Figured 7a). After a torque is applied to the shaft 12 in Figure 1, the<br>
torque induces angular twisting in the shaft 12 over the length L (shown in Figure 7A)<br>
inducing a change in polarization angle in the third measurement light path 50. This<br>
change in angular polarization is either ΘT in the torque measurement sensor<br>
configuration of Figure 1 or is equal to 29T when the half wave plate 64 is present as<br>
shown in Figure 4.<br>
[0041]	This information together with the chart of Figure 6 enables an alternate<br>
method of indirectly detecting the change in angular polarization between the third<br>
measurement light path 50 and the reference light path 36 illustrated in Figure 1. Figure 6<br>
illustrates that the normalized intensity of the light passing through the polarizing filter<br>
52 decreases as the twist angle increases in absolute magnitude. In Figure 1, the twist<br>
angle is exactly equivalent to the change in angular polarization between the third<br>
measurement light path 50 and the reference light path 36, as discussed earlier above. The<br>
graph of Figure 6 provides a relationship that indicates how the intensity of the light<br>
reaching the measurement device 56 decreases as the shaft twist angle increases in<br>
absolute magnitude. Using this knowledge, the measurement device 56 may alternately<br>
be configured to indirectly rather than directly measure the shaft twist angle or change in<br>
polarization angle by measuring changes in the intensity of the light reaching the detector<br>
along the third measurement light path 50. In this configuration, the measurement device<br>
56 monitors the intensity of light in the reference light path 36 and compensates the<br>
detected intensity of light in the third measurement light path 50 according to changes in<br>
intensity in the reference light path 36 so as to cancel out variations in the emitted light<br>
intensity of the light source 24.<br>
[0042]	Figure 8 depicts a method of non-contact measurement of torque<br>
transmitted in a shaft consistent with the present invention. The method begins at block<br><br>
P000011 PTT-DLT<br>
15<br>
802 by providing a light source emitting a polarized light beam. The polarized light<br>
source is preferably a laser light source. The method continues at block 804 with splitting<br>
a reference light beam from the polarized light beam emitted by the light source. At block<br>
806 the polarized light beam is directed along a length of the shaft. At block 808 the<br>
angular polarization of the light transmitted along the shaft is changed according to<br>
torsional twisting of the shaft. At block 810 the angular change in polarization due to<br>
torsional twisting of the shaft is measured relative to the reference light beam. At block<br>
812 the torque is then determined from the measured change in polarization.<br>
