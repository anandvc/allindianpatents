AND RECORDING MEDIUM<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a technical<br>
field of an information recording apparatus,	an<br>
information reproducing apparatus, an information<br>
recording method, an information reproducing method,<br>
recording medium, an information recording medium in<br>
which a recording controlling program is recorded and<br>
an information recording medium in which a reproducing<br>
controlling program is recorded. More specifically, the<br>
present invention relates to a technical field of an<br>
information recording apparatus	and method for<br>
recording record information to be protected by<br>
copyright, an information recording medium in which<br>
a recording controlling program is recorded, a recording<br>
medium in which the record information is recorded,<br>
an information reproducing apparatus and method for<br>
reproducing the record information being recorded while<br><br><br>
securing a copyright on the record information and an<br>
information recording medium in which a reproducing<br>
controlling program is recorded.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
In recent years, increasing the recording density of a<br>
recording medium such as an optical disk is studied and<br>
developed actively. As a result, a DVD (read only DVD<br>
(DVD-ROM) ) , in which one movie for a movie theater can be<br>
recorded, has been prevailing.<br>
On the other hand, following studies and developments<br>
of the DVD-ROM, the studies and developments with respect<br>
to DVD-R (DVD-Recordable), DVD-RW (DVD-Re-Recordable), or<br>
DVD-RAM (DVD-Rewritable), which are recordable optical<br>
disks having high recording density, are made. As a<br>
result, progress has been made in standardizing of these<br>
recordable DVDs and bringing an information recording<br>
'apparatus corresponding to the DVDs to market.<br>
Incidentally, recording information such as a movie<br>
recorded in the DVD-ROM is generally protected by<br>
copyright. Specifically, copying the record information<br>
recorded from the DVD-ROM without permission is prohibited<br>
as a general with a few exceptions.<br>
In order to secure the copyright on the record<br>
information, conventionally, a variety of functions to<br>
prevent illegal copy or disable reproduction of record<br>
information which is illegally copied (hereinafter simply<br><br>
referred to illegal copy protection function) has been<br>
developed.<br>
However, in recent years, personal computers and the<br>
Internet has been becoming pervasive, so that there may be<br>
cases where illegal software for illegally canceling the<br>
conventional illegal copy protection function is developed<br>
and provided for general use through the Internet. If this<br>
illegal software is used, there may be cases where the<br>
record information recorded in the DVD-ROM is. illegally<br>
copied to any one of these recordable DVDs by a personal<br>
computer. Further, there may be cases where the recordable<br>
DVD to which the record information illegally copied is<br>
replicated in large 'quantity by using an authorized<br>
information recording apparatus. Therefore, there was a<br>
problem such that the protection by the copyright came to<br>
naught.<br>
Although the above-mentioned illegal copy has to be<br>
prevented, it should not be prevented that a user records<br>
his private record information, which is recorded by his<br>
own camcorder, in the recordable DVD by using the<br>
information recording apparatus for the purpose of editing<br>
it. Because the private recording itself is not illegal.<br><br>
The present invention has been made taking the<br>
problems into consideration, an object of the invention is<br>
to provide an information recording apparatus and an<br><br>
information recording method, an information recording<br>
medium in which recording control program is recorded, a<br>
recording medium in which the record information is<br>
recorded, an information reproducing apparatus and method<br>
for reproducing the record information, and an information<br>
recording medium in which reproducing control program is<br>
recorded, each of which is capable of securing the<br>
copyright on the record information by making a sharp<br>
distinction between a receding medium in which the above-<br>
mentioned private record information is recorded and<br>
anothar recording medium in which the record information i3<br>
illegally copied by a personal computer, etc., and<br>
preventing the reproduction of the record information<br>
recorded in said another recording medium in which the<br>
record information is illegally copied.<br>
The above object of the present invention can be<br>
achieved by nn information recording apparatus of the<br>
present invention for recording record information in a<br>
recording medium in which first type information<br>
indicating a type of the recording medium is recorded.<br>
The apparatus is provided witht a typa information<br>
recording device for recording second type information,<br>
whose correspondence to the first typa information is set<br>
in advance, in tha recording medium in which the first<br>
type information is recorded; and a recording device for<br>
recording the record information in the recording medium.<br><br>
According to tho prosent invention, the second type<br>
information having tho correspondence to the first typo<br>
information, is recorded in a recording medium as well as<br>
the record information is recorded in the recording medium.<br>
Then, the record information is reproduced only when the<br>
first type information has the correspondence to the fir3t<br>
type information, so tha,t it is possible to prohibit the<br>
illegal recording processing such that the second type<br>
information, which is different from the first type<br>
information, is recorded or, to prohibit the reproduction of<br>
the record information, which is recorded by the illegal<br>
recording processing such that the second type Information<br>
is not recorded. Accordingly, by effectively prohibiting<br>
the raproduction of the record information which ia<br>
recorded by the information processing apparatus or the<br>
like under an illegal, recording processing, a sharp<br>
distinction botween a recoding medium in which a private<br>
record information is recorded and another recording medium<br>
in which the record information ia illegally copied is made<br>
as well as the reproduction of the record information<br>
recorded in said another recording medium in which the<br>
record information is illegally copied ia prevented.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will<br>
' be explained with reference to the drawings.<br>
The embodiment to be explained below is applied to an<br>
information recording/reproducing apparatus, which records<br>
the record information inputted from an external source in<br>
a DVD-R which is a DVD capable of recording the record<br>
information only one time while it is incapable of<br>
rewriting the record information. The information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus can also reproduce record<br>
information, which is recorded in a read only DVD (DVD-ROM)<br>
or a DVD-RW which is another recordable DVD, in addition to<br>
the record information recorded in the DVD-R.<br>
■ (I) Embodiment of DVD-R	, _ , ...<br><br>
A DVD-R served as a recording medium, in which the<br>
recording information is recorded and reproduced by the<br>
information recording/reproducing apparatus, will be<br>
described with reference to FIG. 1.<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates a plan external view and a physical<br>
recording format of the DVD-R after recording the record<br>
information is completed, according to the present<br>
embodiment.<br>
The DVD-R according to the present embodiment<br>
comprises an optical disc capable of recording only once<br>
with a recording membrane such as a color membrane. In a<br>
plan external view, 'the DVD-R has 'a center hall CH at a<br>
center thereof to fix the DVD-R in a spindle motor for<br>
rotating the DVD-R in the information recording/reproducing<br>
apparatus. The DVD-R further has a no-redcordable area 110<br>
not capable of recording the record information from the<br>
inside thereof to the inner circumference, a redcordable<br>
area PA capable of recording the recording information ■ and<br>
an end area EA not capable of recording the recording<br>
information in the outer circumference side.<br>
Further, the redcordable area PA after recording is<br>
completed, is composed of: a beam density test area 111 in<br>
which the test information for setting the density of the<br>
optical beam to be used for recording the record<br>
information is recorded;- a managing data area 112 in which<br>
the data of the set optical beam density and the managing<br>
data to be described later in the recording process are<br><br>
recorded; a lead-in area LIA in which the start information<br>
or the like to be read out upon starting the reproduction<br>
of the recorded record information are recorded in the<br>
recording process of the record information; a file system<br>
information area FS in which the file system information is<br>
recorded as the information for indicating a file structure<br>
in the record information; a data area DA in which the<br>
record information is actually recorded; and a lead-out<br>
area LOA in which the termination' information or the like<br>
to be read out upon terminating the reproduction of the<br>
recorded record information are recorded in the recording<br>
process of the record information.<br>
The lead-in area LIA of each area constituting the<br>
redcordable area PA 'is an area in which each information<br>
described later is recorded in its portion in advance upon<br>
manufacturing a DVD-R 1R. Therefore, the portion is<br>
already formed even in a DVD-R 1R which is on the market as<br>
a blank disk, in which no record information to be<br>
reproduced is recorded.<br>
The lead-in area LIA is divided into: an initial zone<br>
113 in which zero data indicating that the lead-in area LIA<br>
starts therefrom is recorded; a reference code zone 114 in<br>
which a management information and the like, which are<br>
referred upon reproducing the record information recorded<br>
in the DVD-R 1R, are recorded; a first buffer zone 115<br>
functioning as a buffer zone between the reference code<br>
zone 114 and a control data zone 116 described later; a<br><br>
control data zone 116 in which management information and<br>
the like, which is to be referred upon starting recoding<br>
the record information and divided into n pieces of blocks<br>
116-x through 116-n, are recorded; and a second buffer zone<br>
117 functioning as a buffer zone between the control data<br>
zone 116 and the file system information area.<br>
Each -of blocks 116-i through 116.n constituting the<br>
control data zone 116 is provided with auxiliary<br>
information 141 and 144, a disk producing information 142<br>
in which producing information relates to producing of the<br>
DVD-R 1R (a producer's name), a physical format information<br>
143 which is information indicating an optical disk type,<br>
etc. of DVD-R 1R.<br>
The physical format information 143 is provided with a<br>
first disk type information 145 which indicates an optical<br>
disk type of the DVD-R 1R, other information 146 which is<br>
information other than the first disk type information.<br>
The first disk type information 145 is comprised of 4-bit<br>
information. In the DVD-R 1R, the value of the first disk<br>
type information 145 is "0010b" (b indicates a binary<br>
number).<br>
It is standardized that the first disk type<br>
information 145 is used in other DVDs, such as a DVD-ROM, .<br>
the recordable DVD-RW and DVD-RAM. Specifically, in the<br>
DVD-ROM, the value of the first disk type information 145<br>
is set as "0000b". In the DVD-RAM, the value of the first<br>
disk type information 145 is set as "0001b".<br><br>
(II) Embodiment of physical format and logical format of<br>
record information<br>
Next, a physical format and a logical format, with<br>
which the record • information recorded in the data area DA<br>
by the information recording/reproducing apparatus of the<br>
present embodiment should be in conformity, will be<br>
schematically explained with reference to FIGs. 2 to 6.<br>
Alternatively, FIGs. 2, 4 and 5 hierarchically<br>
illustrate the physical format. FIG. 3 a constitution of a<br>
GOP (Group Of Picture) in the physical format. FIG. 6<br>
hierarchically illustrates the logical format corresponding<br>
to the physical format.<br>
The physical format explained below is a format with<br>
which not only the record information to be recorded in the<br>
DVD-R 1R but also the record information recorded in the<br>
DVD-ROM and the record information to be recorded in the<br>
DVD-RW and the DVD-RAM should be in conformity.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, image information and audio<br>
information are divided into a plurality of Video Title<br>
Sets (VTS) 3 (VTS # . 1 to VTS #n) having an ID<br>
(identification) number, respectively to be recorded..<br>
The VTS means a set (a pack) packing image information<br>
and titles relevant to the image information, whose<br>
attributions such as the number of sound information and<br>
sub-picture information (i.e., the information of a sub-<br>
picture such as a subtitle of a movie or the like) , a<br>
specification, and a corresponding language are identical.<br><br>
The titles are works such as movies, which producers intend<br>
to present to viewers. More specifically, for example, a<br>
plurality of movies, which correspond to one movie, having<br>
scripts of different languages and the like may be recorded<br>
in different titles respectively.' Further, a movie of a<br>
theater version and the corresponding movie of a special<br>
version may be recorded in different titles respectively.<br>
Alternatively, just before an area in which a VTS#1 in<br>
a VTS 3 is recorded, a video manager 2 is recorded. The<br>
details of the video manager will be explained later.<br>
A piece of VTS 3 is divided into a plurality of VOBs<br>
10 having ID numbers, respectively, to be recorded with<br>
control data 11 as a head. A portion composed of a<br>
plurality of VOBs 10 is referred to as a VOB set (VOBS) .<br>
In order to distinguish the control data 11 as other data<br>
composing the VTS 3 and a plurality of VOBs 10 comprising<br>
an substance of the image information 'and the audio<br>
information, the substantial portion is referred to as a<br>
VOB set.<br>
In the control data 11 to be recorded in a head of the<br>
VTS 3, the information such as PGCI (Program Chain<br>
Information) or the like comprising various information<br>
with regard to a program chain, which is a logical segment<br>
made by combining a plurality of. cells (a cell will be<br>
described later) and the backup information for it are<br>
recorded as VTSI (Video Title Set Information).<br>
Alternatively, in each VOB 10, an substantial portion of<br><br>
the image information and the audio information (i.e., the<br>
image or the audio itself other than the control<br>
information) is recorded in addition to the control<br>
information.<br>
Further, one piece of VOB 10 is composed of a<br>
plurality of cells 20 having an ID number, respectively.<br>
One piece of VOB 10 must be composed of integral multiples<br>
of the cells 20, so that one cell 20 is not shared by two<br>
pieces of VOB 10.<br>
One cell 20 is composed of a plurality of VOB units<br>
(VOBU) 30 having an ID number, respectively. The VOB unit<br>
30 means unit information including each of the image<br>
information, the audio information and the sub picture<br>
information.<br>
Then, one VOB unit 30 is composed of: a navigation<br>
pack 41 (hereinafter, simply referred to as a navi pack) in<br>
which the control information to control the data or the<br>
like included in the VOB unit 30 is stored; video data 42<br>
as the image information; audio data 43 as the audio<br>
information and sub picture data 44 as the sub picture<br>
information. Only the image data is recorded as the video<br>
data 42, and only the audio data is recorded as the audio<br>
data 43. Alternatively, as the sub' picture data 44, only<br>
graphic data such as characters, a graphic as the sub<br>
picture are recorded. It is defined in the standard that<br>
there are eight kinds of audios capable of being recorded<br><br>
in the DVD-R 1R and there are thirty two kinds of the sub<br>
pictures capable of being recorded at the maximum.<br>
Alternatively, the reproduction time (the reproduction<br>
time corresponding to the data recorded between one navi<br>
pack 41 and a navi pack 41 adjacent to this one navi pack<br>
41) in response to one VOB unit 30 is recorded so as to<br>
have a length in the range of not less than 0.4 second and<br>
not more than 1.0 second. Therefore, the navi pack 41 is<br>
definitely detected one time in the range of 0.4 second to<br>
1.0 second upon reproduction.<br>
Additionally,- in one VOB unit 30, the navi pack 41<br>
should be located at a head thereof. However, each of the<br>
video data 42, the audio data 43 and the sub picture data<br>
44 is not needed to be located in the VOB unit 30.<br>
Alternatively, if they are located in the VOB unit 30, the<br>
number and the order thereof may be arbitrarily set.<br>
A segment of each of the video data 42, the audio data<br>
43 and the sub picture data 44 shown in FIG. 1 is generally<br>
referred to as a pack P.<br>
In other words, the video data 42, the audio data 43<br>
and the sub picture data 44 are respectively divided into a<br>
pack P to be recorded in one VOB unit 30. Further, the<br>
pack P in which the video data 42 is recorded i's referred<br>
to as a video pack, the pack P in which the audio data 43<br>
is recorded is referred to as an audio pack, and the pack P<br>
in which the sub picture data 44 is recorded is referred to<br>
as a sub picture pack. Further, read-out starting time<br><br>
information referred to as a SCR (System Clock Reference)<br>
is recorded in a back header to be recorded in the head of<br>
each pack P. The SCR indicates a read-out start time on a<br>
reproduction time axis when the input in respective buffers<br>
should be started by reading out the data included in each<br>
pack P from a track buffer in the information reproducing<br>
apparatus for reproducing the information recorded in the<br>
DVD-R 1R. Alternatively, the video data 42, the audio data<br>
43 or the sub picture data 44 is normally recorded in the<br>
above described each pack P for every packet as a recording<br>
unit obtained by further subsectioning the pack P.<br>
However, according to the DVD-R 1R of the present<br>
embodiment, one pack P is generally composed of one packet.<br>
Finally, the navi pack 41 is composed of DSI data 51<br>
comprising retrieval information for retrieving the image,<br>
the audio or the like to be reproduced and displayed<br>
(specifically, an address or the like on the DVD-R 1R in<br>
which the image, the audio or the like to be reproduced and<br>
displayed), and PCI data 50 comprising the information in<br>
relation to the reproduction displaying control upon<br>
displaying the image or the audio retrieved on the basis of<br>
the DSI data 51. The DSI data 51 and the PCI data 50<br>
compose a DSI packet and a PCI packet as a packet PT,<br>
respectively, then, they are recorded.<br>
Further, all of the video data 42 included in one VOB<br>
unit 30 are composed of one or plural Groups of Picture<br>
(GOP).	- •<br><br>
The DSI data 51 and the PCI data 50 will be described<br>
in detail later.<br>
Alternatively, the PCI data 50 includes highlight<br>
information that defines the indication and the operation<br>
when the viewer selects a certain alternative item.<br>
Depending on the highlight information, for example, the<br>
change of the screen display with respect to the item<br>
selection in an image which displays the items to be<br>
selected by the viewer (menu screen), a display position to<br>
be changed in accordance with the selection, a command for<br>
the selected item (i.e., a command for indicating the<br>
operation to be carried out to the selected item) and the<br>
like are set.<br>
The image information for displaying a frame, a<br>
selection button- and the like, which are necessary for<br>
composing a menu image and displaying it, is recorded- as<br>
the sub picture data 44 as the above described sub image<br>
information.<br>
Additionally, the above described GOP is the minimum<br>
image unit by itself, which is defined in the MPEG (Moving<br>
Picture Expert Group) 2 system as an image compression<br>
system employed upon recording the image information in the<br>
DVD-R 1R of the present invention. In a head of each GOP,<br>
reproduction display time information referred to as a PTS<br>
(Presentation Time Stamp) is recorded to indicate the<br>
reproduction time on the reproduction time axis when the<br>
video data 42 included in the GOP should be displayed.<br><br>
The summary of the MPEG 2 system will be explained<br>
below. Generally, there are many cases such that frame<br>
images located back and forth of one piece of frame image<br>
are similar each other and have a mutual relation in<br>
continuous frame images. The MPEG 2 system has views upon<br>
the point. In the MPEG 2 system, based on a plurality of<br>
frame images to be transferred at interval of some frames,<br>
another frame image existing among the plurality of frame<br>
images is generated by an interpolation calculation on the<br>
basis of a moving vector or the like of an original image.<br>
In the case, when' recording another frame image, only by<br>
recording the information with regard to the difference<br>
among the plurality of frame images and the moving vector,<br>
it becomes possible to predict another frame image with<br>
reference to the recorded information and to reproduce<br>
another frame image upon reproduction. Therefore, it<br>
becomes possible to compress and record the image.<br>
Further, the summary of the above described GOP will<br>
be explained with reference to FIG. 3. FIG. 3 illustrates<br>
an example of a plurality of frame images composing one<br>
GOP. FIG. 3 shows that one GOP 52 is composed of twelve<br>
pieces of frame images (the number of frame images included<br>
in one GOP 52 is not fixed in the MPEG 2 system) . In the<br>
frame images, a frame image indicated by a reference<br>
numeral "I" is referred to as an I picture (Intra-coded<br>
picture) and it means a frame image capable of reproducing<br>
a complete frame image only by its own image.<br><br>
Alternatively, a -frame image indicated by a reference<br>
numeral "P" is referred to as a P picture (Predictive-coded<br>
picture) and it means a predictive image generated by<br>
decrypting the difference among the compensated and<br>
reproduced predictive images or the like on the basis of<br>
the decrypted I picture or another P picture.<br>
Alternatively, a frame image indicated by a reference<br>
numeral "B" is referred to as a B picture (Bidirectionally<br>
predictive-coded picture) and it means a predictive image<br>
reproduced by using not only the decrypted I picture or P<br>
picture but also a future I picture or a future P picture<br>
recorded in an optical disc or the like for prediction. In<br>
FIG. 3, a predictive relation- (interpolation relation)<br>
among respective pictures is represented by an arrow.<br>
Alternatively, a general MPEG 2 system used in DVDs<br>
including the DVD-R 1R according to the present invention<br>
employs a variable rate system in which the data amount<br>
included in each GOP 52 is not fixed. In other words,<br>
respective pictures included in one GOP 52 correspond to a<br>
moving image with rapid movement, so that in the case that<br>
the mutual relation between respective pictures is small,<br>
the data amount for composing respective pictures becomes<br>
large. Accordingly, the data amount included in one GOP 52<br>
also becomes large. On the other hand, respective pictures<br>
included in one GOP 52 correspond to a moving image with<br>
less movement, so that in the case that the mutual relation<br>
between respective pictures is large, the data amount for ._<br><br>
composing respective pictures becomes small and the data<br>
amount included in one GOP 52 also becomes small.<br>
In the physical format having a hierarchical structure<br>
described in the above with reference to FIG. 2, respective<br>
segments are freely set by a manufacture of the record<br>
information in accordance with his or her intention to be<br>
recorded. By reproducing the information on the basis of a<br>
logical structure to be explained later for every segment,<br>
it is possible to carry out various ■ and varied<br>
reproduction.<br>
Next, the detail configuration of the video manager 2<br>
will be explained with reference to FIG. 4.<br>
At first, the video manager 2 is constituted by VMGI<br>
(Video Manager Information) 4 as the main content of the<br>
video manager 2 which serves as the information associated<br>
with a whole of the image information and the sound<br>
information, which are recorded in the DVD-R1R, and other<br>
information 5 as other appendant information 5.<br>
In the next place, the VMGI4 is constituted by an<br>
access table 6 for accessing the above described respective<br>
titles, a menu to indicate the names of the above described<br>
respective titles as the other information and the<br>
information for preventing the illegal copy, and other<br>
information 7 including the back up information or the like<br>
of these information.<br>
Additionally, within the access table 6,<br>
identification information 8, which is the identification<br><br>
information as the above described video manager 2, second<br>
disk type information 9, which is characteristic<br>
information of the invention to indicate an optical disk<br>
type of the DVD-R 1R as same as the above described first<br>
disk type information 145, and other information 12, which<br>
is the information other than these information, are<br>
included. The second disk type information 9 comprises the<br>
information of 2 bits, which is recorded together when the<br>
record information is recorded in the DVD-R1R to be<br>
described later (at this point, the second disk type<br>
information 9 is different from the above described first<br>
disk type information 145, which has been recorded in<br>
advance in the process of manufacturing). In the case that<br>
the second disk type information 9 is recorded in the DVD-R<br>
1R, its value is set to be "10b".<br>
Alternatively, within other information 12, the<br>
version information or the .like to indicate a version<br>
number under a standard of the physical format, which has<br>
been currently explained, is included.<br>
Alternatively, also in the DVD exclusively used for<br>
reproducing as other DVD and the above described DVD-RW and<br>
the DVD-RAM capable of recording the information, the above<br>
described second disk type information 9 and the second<br>
disk type information 88 to be described later are<br>
recorded. Specifically, as same as the above described<br>
first disk type information 145, values of the second 'disk<br>
type information 9 and the second disk type information 88<br><br>
are set in such a manner that, if the DVD exclusively used<br>
for reproducing is used, the values become "00b", if the<br>
DVD-RAM is used, the values become "01b" and if the DVD-RW<br>
is used, the values become "lib", respectively.<br>
A physical data structure of the above described DSI<br>
data 51 and the PCI data 50 will be described with<br>
reference to FIG. 5.<br>
At first, as shown in FIG. 5, the PCI data 50 is<br>
comprised of general information 55 as the PCI data 50<br>
itself and the other information 56 as the rest<br>
information.<br>
Further, the general information 55 is composed of:<br>
navi pack relative position information 70 as relative<br>
recording address information from a head of the VOB 10 of<br>
the above described navi pack 41; VOBU reproduction start<br>
time information 71 for indicating a reproduction start<br>
time on the reproduction time axis of the VOB unit 30 in<br>
which this navi pack 41 is included; VOBU reproduction<br>
termination time information 72 for indicating a<br>
reproduction termination . time on the reproduction time<br>
axis of the VOB unit 30; and other information 73 as the<br>
rest information.<br>
The DSI data 51 is comprised of: general information<br>
75 as the DSI data 51 itself; VOB information 76 as the<br>
information relevant to the VOB 10 to which the navi pack<br>
41 belongs; VOBU search information'-: 7 7 for indicating<br>
recording position on the DVD-R 1R of other VOB units 30 to<br><br>
be reproduced before and after the VOB unit 30 to which the<br>
navi pack 41 belongs is- reproduced, and other information<br>
78 as the rest information.<br>
Then, the general information 75 is comprised of: navi<br>
pack relative position information 85 similar to the above<br>
described navi pack relative position information 70, VOBU<br>
identification number 86 for identifying the VOB unit 30 to<br>
which the navi pack 41 belongs, and other information 87 as<br>
the rest information.<br>
Further, the VOB information 76 is comprised of: VOBU<br>
reproduction start time information 80 for indicating the<br>
reproduction start time on the reproduction time axis of<br>
the VOB 10 to which VOB unit 30 including the navi pack 41<br>
belongs; VOBU reproduction termination time information 81<br>
for indicating the reproduction termination time on the<br>
reproduction time axis of the VOB 10; and other information<br>
82 as the rest information.<br>
Still further, as the VOBU search information 77, as<br>
shown in FIG. 3, the position information is included as a<br>
list to indicate the position information for indicating a<br>
recording position on the DVD-R 1R of the VOB unit 30 next<br>
to the VOB unit 30 to which the navi pack 41 belongs, and a<br>
recording position on the DVD 1 of the VOB unit 30 one<br>
previous to the VOB unit 30 to which the navi pack 41<br>
belongs, and the position information for indicating<br>
recording positions on the DVD-R 1R of other VOB units 30<br>
to be reproduced in the rage of 120 seconds after the start<br><br>
time- of the VOB unit 30 to 120 seconds before the start<br>
time of the VOB unit 30.<br>
Of the above-explained each information, information<br>
for. managing a manner of reproduction of the record<br>
information, such as the video manager 2, the control data<br>
11, the navi pack 41, PTS in each pack header and the like.,<br>
collectively means navigation information.<br>
A logical format (a logical structure) obtained by<br>
combining the record information recorded by the physical<br>
segments shown in FIGs. 2, 4 and 5 will be explained with<br>
reference to FIG. 6. Alternatively, in the logical format<br>
shown in FIG. 6, . the information is not actually recorded<br>
on the DVD-R 1R, but the information (the access<br>
information, the time information or the like) for<br>
combining each data (specifically, the cell 20) shown in<br>
FIGs. 2, 4 and 5 and reproducing it in the logical<br>
structure shown in FIG. 6 is recorded on the DVD-R 1R,<br>
specifically, in the control data 11.<br>
For a clear explanation, the explanation will be given<br>
from a lower hierarchy in FIG. 6. By selecting a plurality<br>
of cells 20 and combining them in the physical format<br>
explained above in FIG. 2, one program 60 is logically<br>
composed on the basis of the manufacture's intention. The<br>
program 60 is also the minimum logical unit capable of<br>
being accessed in such a manner that a system controller in<br>
the above described information recording/reproducing<br>
apparatus identifies the segment and uses a command..<br><br>
Alternatively, the'manufacture may also define the program<br>
60 as the minimum unit such that the viewer can freely<br>
select one cell 20 or packed plural cells 20 and views<br>
them. The unit is referred to as a PTT (Part of Title)' .<br>
Alternatively, since one program 60 is logically<br>
composed by selecting a plurality of cells 20, it is also<br>
possible to use one cell 20 in a plurality of programs 60,<br>
in other words, redundant use of the cell 20 such that one<br>
cell 20 is reproduced in different and plural programs 60<br>
is possible for the manufacturer.<br>
The number of one cell 20 is treated as a cell ID<br>
number (it is represented by a cell ID# in FIG. 2) upon<br>
treating the cell 20 in the physical format shown in FIG.<br>
2. On the other hand, the number of one cell 20 is treated<br>
as a cell number in the order of the description in a PGCI<br>
to be described later upon treating the cell 20 in the<br>
■physical format shown in FIG. 6.<br>
One PGC (Program Chain) 61 is logically composed on<br>
the basis of the manufacture's intention by combining a<br>
plurality of programs 60. In the unit of the .PGC 61, the<br>
above described PGCI is defined. The present PGCI<br>
includes: a reproduction order of the cells 20 for each<br>
program 60 upon reproducing respective programs 60 (a<br>
specific program number is assigned for every program 60 by<br>
this reproduction order); an address as a recording<br>
position on the DVD-R 1R of respective cells 20; the number<br>
of a head cell 20 to be reproduced in one program '60; a<br><br>
reproduction system of respective programs 60; and various<br>
commands (a command capable of being designated by the<br>
manufacture for every PGC 61 or every cell 20).' When<br>
recording the information in the DVD-R 1R according to the<br>
present embodiment, the manufacturer selects any one of<br>
reproduction methods among a normal reproduction, a random<br>
reproduction and a shuffle reproduction for every PGC 60 to<br>
reproduce the program 60 upon reproduction. The random<br>
reproduction is performed by using random numbers, so that<br>
the same program 60 may be possibly reproduced in plural<br>
times. The shuffle reproduction is also a random<br>
reproduction using random numbers similar to the above<br>
random reproduction, however, the program 60 is reproduced<br>
only once so that the same program 60 is not reproduced in<br>
plural times.<br>
Alternatively, the recording position of the PGCI on<br>
the DVD-R 1R is located within the control data 11 • (refer<br>
to FIG. 2) as described above. However, in the case that<br>
the PGCI is related to a menu within the video manager 2,<br>
the recording position of the PGCI is located within the<br>
control data (not shown) included in the video manager 2.<br>
Alternatively, one PGCI 61 may include the data such<br>
as a substantial image, an audio and the like as a<br>
combination of the programs 60- (in other words,, a<br>
combination of the cells 20) in addition to the above<br>
described PGCI.<br><br>
Further, in one PGC 61, it is also possible to<br>
redundantly use the cell 20 as described in the explanation<br>
of the program 60 (namely, the same sell 20 is used by the<br>
different PGC 61) . Alternatively, the manufacturer is<br>
capable of selecting a method (a method for reproducing<br>
uncontinuously arranged cells) for reproducing the cells 20<br>
regardless of the order that the cells 20 (for example,<br>
previously reproducing the cell 20 recorded lately or the<br>
like) are stored in the DVD-R 1R in addition to a method<br>
for reproducing the cells 20 in the order that they are<br>
stored in the DVD-R 1R (a method for reproducing<br>
continuously arranged cells) with respect to the cell 20 to<br>
be used.<br>
One title 62 is logically composed of one or a<br>
plurality of PGC 61. Fo'r example, the title 62 is a unit<br>
corresponding to one piece of movie and the title 62 is<br>
information which the manufacturer wishes to provide to the<br>
viewer of the DVD-R 1R.<br>
Then, one VTS 63 is logically composed of one or<br>
plural titles 62. This .titles 62 included in the VTS 63<br>
have common attribute, respectively. For example, with<br>
respect to one and the same movie, the movies having<br>
different languages correspond to. respective titles 62.<br>
Alternatively, the information corresponding to one VTS 63<br>
shown in FIG. 6 corresponds to the information included in<br>
one VTS 3 shown in FIG. 2. In other words, all information<br>
logically included in the VTS 63 shown in. FIG. 6 are<br><br>
recorded in the DVD-R 1R as one VTS 3.<br>
On the basis of the above described logical format,<br>
the manufacturer designates the record information<br>
segmented in the physical format, so that the title (a<br>
movie or the like) to be viewed by the viewer is formed.<br>
(Ill) Embodiment of information recording/reproducing<br>
apparatus<br>
An information recording/reproducing apparatus for<br>
recording the record information in a DVD-R 1R or a DVD-RW<br>
based on the above described physical format as well as<br>
reproducing the recorded information from the DVD-R 1R or<br>
the DVD-RW according to the present embodiment will be<br>
described with reference to FIGs. 7 to 10 .<br>
Alternatively, FIG. 7 is a block diagram for<br>
illustrating a schematic constitution of an information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus according to the present<br>
embodiment. FIG. 8 is a flow chart for illustrating the<br>
information recording processing according to the present<br>
embodiment. FIG. 9 is a diagram for illustrating a loading<br>
processing executed upon executing the reproducing<br>
processing of the record information (namely, the .loading<br>
processing for loading the DVD-R 1R or the DVD-RW in the<br>
information recording/reproducing apparatus according to<br>
the present embodiment) . FIG. 10 is a flow chart for<br>
illustrating the information reproducing processing<br>
according to FIG. 10.<br>
As shown in FIG. 7, an information<br><br>
recording/reproducing apparatus S according to the present<br>
embodiment is provided with: a pickup 120 as a recording<br>
device, a first detecting device and a second detecting<br>
device; a modulation unit 121'; a formatter 122; a video<br>
encoder 123; an audio encoder.124; a system controller 125<br>
as a type information recording device and a reproducing<br>
device; a memory 127; a demodulation unit 128; a video<br>
decoder 129; an audio decoder 130; a servo IC (Integrated<br>
Circuit) 131; a spindle motor 132; an operating unit 133; a<br>
multiplexer 134 and a demultiplexer 135. Alternatively,<br>
the system controller 125 is provided with a navigation<br>
information generator 126 for generating the above<br>
described navi pack 41 or the like.<br>
The schematic operation of respective units will be<br>
explained.<br>
At first, the spindle motor 132 rotates the loaded<br>
DVD-R 1R or DVD-RW in a' predetermined rotation speed on the<br>
basis of a spindle control signal Sss from the servo IC<br>
131.<br>
On one hand, video^ information Sv as the recording<br>
information to be recorded in a data area DA of the DVD-R<br>
1R or DVD-RW is inputted in the video encoder 123 after it<br>
is inputted from the outside.<br>
Then, the video encoder 123 executes an encoding<br>
processing set in advance with respect to the video<br>
information Sv on the basis of the control signal Scv from<br>
the system controller 125, generates an encoded video<br><br>
signal Sev and outputs it. to the multiplexer- 134.<br>
Specifically, for example, the encoding processing is one<br>
in the above described MPEG 2 system.<br>
On the other hand, audio information Sa as the<br>
recording information to be recorded in the data area DA of<br>
the DVD-R 1R or DVD-RW is inputted in the audio encoder 124<br>
after it is inputted from the outside.<br>
Then, the audio encoder 124 executes an encoding<br>
processing set in advance with respect to the audio<br>
information Sa on the basis of the control signal Sea from<br>
the system controller 125, generates an encoded audio<br>
signal Sea and outputs it to the multiplexer 134.<br>
Specifically, for example, the encoding processing is one<br>
in the above described MPEG 2 system.<br>
Therefore, the multiplexer 134 superposes (or<br>
multiplexes) the image information and the audio<br>
information included in the encoded video signal Sev by a<br>
predetermined processing, generates a superposed signal Smx<br>
and outputs it to the formatter 122.<br>
The multiplexer 134 makes the above described encoded<br>
audio signal Sea pass as it is and makes it into the<br>
superpose signal Smx.<br>
The formatter 122 combines navigation information<br>
signal Snd to be described later from the navigation<br>
information generator 126 and the above described<br>
superposed signal Smx so as to be a system of the physical<br>
format shown in FIGs. 2, 4 and 5 on the basis of a control<br><br>
signal Scf from the system controller 125. Then, the<br>
formatter 122 generates a format signal Smt and outputs it<br>
to the modulation unit 121.<br>
Respective recording information to be inputted in the<br>
formatter 122 as the superposed signal Smx are outputted to<br>
the system controller 125 as recording information signal<br>
Sfm in a preset timing so that they are provided for<br>
generating the above navigation information in the<br>
navigation information generator 126.<br>
Then, the.modulation unit 121 executes a predetermined<br>
modulation processing (specifically, for example, 8-16<br>
modulation processing) to the format signal Smt, generates<br>
a modulation signal Sfe and outputs it to the pickup 120.<br>
Therefore, the pickup 120 generates an(optical beam B,<br>
of which density is modulated by the modulation signal Sfe,<br>
forms a pit corresponding to the above navigation<br>
information included in the modulation signal Sfe, and<br>
respective recording information on the information track<br>
by irradiating the generated optical beam. B on the<br>
information track within the information recording surface<br>
(not shown) of the DVD-R 1R or DVD-RW. Then, the<br>
navigation information and respective recording information<br>
are recorded on the DVD-R 1R or DVD-RW in a system of the<br>
physical format shown in FIG. 1 and FIG. 3.<br>
A deviation in a vertical direction with respect to<br>
the above information recording surface and a horizontal<br>
direction with respect to the above information recording<br><br>
surface between a converge position of the optical beam B<br>
and the above information track is solved by moving an<br>
objective lens (not illustrated) in the pickup 120 (an<br>
objective lens for converging the optical beam B) in the<br>
above horizontal direction and the above vertical direction<br>
on the basis of the pickup servo signal Ssp to be outputted<br>
from the servo IC 131, namely, by performing focus servo<br>
control and tracking servo control.<br>
Therefore, the servo IC 131 generates the above<br>
spindle control signal Sss and the pickup servo signal Ssp<br>
on the basis of a control signal Ssc form the system<br>
controller 125 to output them to the spindle motor 132 and<br>
the pickup 120, respectively.<br>
On one hand, in the case of reproducing the recording<br>
information or the like recorded in the DVD-R 1R or DVD-RW<br>
in advance, the pickup 120 generates an optical beam B with<br>
a predetermined density for reproduction to be irradiated<br>
to the information track on which the above pit is formed.<br>
Then, on the basis of this reflected light, the pickup 120<br>
generates a detection signal Spp corresponding to the<br>
recording information or the like to output it to the<br>
demodulation unit 128.<br>
Therefore, the demodulation unit 128 executes the<br>
demodulation processing in association with the<br>
demodulation processing in the above modulation unit 121 to<br>
the detection signal Spp, generates the demodulation signal<br>
Spd and outputs it to the demultiplexer 135.	'- - ■<br><br>
Then, the demultiplexer 135 separates the image<br>
information and the audio information included in the video<br>
information when the demodulation signal Spd includes the<br>
video information, so that it generates a separated signal<br>
Sdmx to output it to the video decoder 129.<br>
On one hand, in the case that the demodulation signal<br>
Spd includes the' audio information, the demultiplexer 135<br>
makes the demodulation' signal Spd pass as it is and outputs<br>
it to the audio decoder 130.<br>
The video decoder 126 executes the decoding processing<br>
corresponding to the encoding processing in the above video<br>
encoder 123 to the separated signal Sdmx on the basis of a<br>
control signal Scdv from the system controller 125,<br>
generates a decoding video signal Sdv and outputs it to a<br>
monitor (not shown) or the like in the outside.<br>
Further, the audio decoder 130 executes the decoding<br>
processing corresponding to the encoding processing in the<br>
above audio encoder 124 to the modulation signal Spd<br>
including the audio information on the basis of a control<br>
signal Scda from the system controller 125, generates a<br>
decoding video signal' Sda and outputs it to an amplifier<br>
(not shown) or the like in the outside.<br>
On the other hand, the operating unit 133 generates an<br>
operational signal Sin corresponding to the opera'tion and<br>
outputs it to the system controller 125 when the operation<br>
for carrying out the recording processing or the<br>
reproduction processing in the information<br><br>
recording/reproducing apparatus S is carried out by the<br>
user.<br>
Further, the navigation information generator 126<br>
generates the above navigation information signal Snd<br>
including the above respective navigation information to be<br>
recorded in the DVD-R 1R or DVD-RW upon recording<br>
processing to be described later on the basis of the<br>
control of the system controller 125 based on an operation<br>
signal Sin and the recording information signal Sfm and<br>
outputs the generated navigation information signal Snd to<br>
one of inputting terminals of the formatter 122.<br>
Therefore, the above formatter 122 superposes the<br>
recording information in the superpose signal Smx and the<br>
navigation information in the navigation information signal<br>
Snd, so that the above format signal Smt including the<br>
recording information having the physical format shown in<br>
FIGs. 2, 4 and 5 is generated.<br>
In parallel with these operations, the system<br>
controller 125 generates respective control signals Scv,<br>
Sea, Scf, Ssc, Scdv and Scda for controlling the respective<br>
operations to output them to the corresponding composing<br>
members, respectively, while giving and receiving necessary<br>
information to and from the memory 127 as a memory signal<br>
Sm. Further, the system controller 125 executes<br>
centralized control for a recording processing, a<br>
reproducing processing and the like described below,<br>
(i) An embodiment of recording processing<br><br>
In the next place, the recording processing of the<br>
record information according to the embodiment will be<br>
specifically described with reference to the FIG. 8.<br>
Alternatively, the recording processing to be described<br>
below comprises the regular (not illegal) recording<br>
processing which is performed by loading a DVD-R 1R or DVD-<br>
RW (except for a DVD-RAM) serving as a DVD capable of<br>
recording the information in the information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus S.<br>
As shown in FIG. 8, according to the recording<br>
processing of the embodiment, if the above described DVD-R<br>
1R or DVD-RW is loaded and the instruction for starting the<br>
recording processing is executed in an operating unit 133,<br>
at first, the above first class information 145, which has<br>
been recorded in advance in the loaded DVD-R 1R or DVD-RW,<br>
is detected (step SI).<br>
In the next place, if its value is "0010b" to indicate<br>
the DVD-R 1R (step S2; YES) when a content of the detected<br>
first disk type information 145 (step S2) is confirmed, the<br>
above described second disk type information 9 (the second<br>
disk type information included in the VMGI 4) and the<br>
second disk type information 88 (the second .disk type<br>
information included in the DSI data 51) are set in a<br>
navigation information generator 126 as "10b", respectively<br>
(step S3) so as to start the recording of the record<br>
information (step S4). According to the processing of this<br>
step S4, the record information including the above<br><br>
described first disk type information 145 and the second<br>
disk type information 9 and 88 are recorded within the<br>
loaded DVD-R 1R based on the physical format, which is<br>
shown in the above described FIGs. 1 to 5.<br>
Alternatively, it is confirmed whether the operation<br>
to stop the recording processing is performed or not by the<br>
operating unit 133 (step S5) . If the operation is not<br>
performed (step S5; NO) , returning to the step S4, the<br>
recording processing is continued. On one hand, the stop<br>
operation is performed (step S5; YES), the recording<br>
processing is stopped at that point (step S6) to terminate<br>
a series of the recording processing.<br>
On the other hand, in the case that a content of the<br>
detected first class information 145 is not "0010b" (step<br>
S2; NO) in the determination of the step S2, then, it is<br>
confirmed whether a content of the detected first disk type<br>
information 145 is "0011b" to indicate the DVD-RW or not<br>
(step S7) .<br>
Then, if the value of the detected first disk type<br>
information 145 is "0011b", (step S7; YES), the above<br>
described second disk type information 9 and 88 are set<br>
within the navigation information generator 126 as "lib",<br>
respectively (step S8), the recording of the record<br>
information is started (step S4) and the' processing after<br>
the above described step S5 will be effected after that.<br>
In this case, according to the processing in this step S4,<br>
the recording information will be recorded within the<br><br>
loaded DVD-RW by the physical formats shown in the above<br>
described FIGs. 1 to 5.<br>
Alternatively, according to the above described<br>
illegal recording processing, the processing in the steps<br>
S3 and S8 shown in FIG. 8 are not executed. As a result,<br>
in the optical disk, in which the illegal recording<br>
processing is performed, the content of the first disk type<br>
information 145 is different from the contents of the<br>
second disk type information 9. and 88 or the second disk<br>
type information 9 and 88 are definitely not recorded.<br>
More particularly, for example, in the case that the<br>
recording information, which is recorded in the DVD-ROM, is<br>
illegally copied in a bit-by-bit system in the DVD-R 1R,<br>
the second disk type information 9 and 88 are remained to<br>
be "00b" to indicate the DVD-ROM.<br>
In the determination in the step S7, if the value of<br>
the detected first disk type information 145 is not "0011b"<br>
(step S7; NO), the value of the detected first disk type<br>
information 145 is not any one of "0010b" and "0011b". In<br>
this case, it is determined that the DVD currently loaded<br>
is the DVD-ROM, in which the value of the first disk type<br>
information 145 is "0000b", so that the recording<br>
processing is immediately terminated.<br>
(ii) An embodiment of reproducing processing<br>
In the next place, the reproducing processing<br>
according to the embodiment for reproducing the recording<br>
information in the DVD-R 1R or DVD-RW in which the<br><br>
recording information is recorded by the recording<br>
processing shown in FIG. 8 will be specifically explained<br>
with reference to FIGs. 9 and 10.<br>
(A) An embodiment of loading processing<br>
At first, the processing in the case that the DVD-R 1R<br>
or DVD-RW is loaded in the information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus S upon reproducing the<br>
recording information will be described with reference to<br>
FIG. 9 below.<br>
As shown in FIG. 9, in the loading processing<br>
according to the embodiment, at first, the DVD-R 1R or DVD-<br>
RW is inserted from a loading opening (not illustrated)<br>
within the information recording/reproducing apparatus S,<br>
so that the loading processing is started to fix a<br>
rotational axis of a spindle motor 132 by using a loading<br>
mechanism (not illustrated) (step S10).<br>
Then, it is confirmed whether the loading of the DVD-R<br>
1R or DVD-RW is completed or not (step Sll). Then, if it<br>
is not completed (step Sll; NO), the processing is returned<br>
to the step S10 again so that the loading processing is<br>
continued. On one hand, if the processing is completed<br>
(step Sll; YES), then, rotation of the DVD-R 1R or DVD-RW<br>
and condense of an optical beam B is started via the above<br>
described respective servo controlling (step S12).<br>
After that, the starting information or the like<br>
within the above described lead-in-area LIA (including the<br>
above described first class information 145) and the above<br><br>
described VMGI 4 are read out (step S13).<br>
After that, it is confirmed whether the VMGI 4 is<br>
correctly read out or not in the step S13 (step S14) . If<br>
it is not correctly read out (step S14, NO), it is'assumed<br>
that the recording information which is recorded in the<br>
DVD-R 1R does not'conform to the above described physical<br>
format. After notifying the user of this, the processing<br>
is shifted to the next reproducing processing.<br>
On the other hand, if the VMGI 4 is correctly read out<br>
(step S14; YES), then, the initial confirmation such as<br>
confirmation of a version number of the physical format on<br>
the basis of the read out VMGI 4 is excuted (step S15) . In<br>
the next place, the content of the above described first<br>
disk type information 145 that is read out (step S13) is<br>
confirmed. Then, it is confirmed whether its value is<br>
"0000b" ■ to indicate the DVD exclusively used for<br>
reproducing or not (step S16) .<br>
Then, if the content of the first disk type<br>
information 145 is "0000b" (step S16; YES), it is<br>
conseguently determined whether the above described second<br>
disk type information 9 in the VMGI 4 is "00b" or not (step<br>
S17) .<br>
Therefore, if the second disk type information 9 is<br>
"00b" (step S17; YES), it is supposed that the normal DVD<br>
exclusively used for reproducing is currently loaded in the<br>
information recording/reproducing apparatus S and the<br>
processing is shifted to the next reproducing processing. . ..<br><br>
On one hand, if the second disk type information 9 is<br>
not "00b" in the determination of- the step S17 (step S17;<br>
NO) , the type of the optical disk to be indicated by the<br>
first disk type information 145 and the type of the optical<br>
disk to be indicated by the second disk type information 9<br>
are different each other in the optical disk which are<br>
currently loaded in the information recording/reproducing<br>
apparatus S, so that it is highly potential that this<br>
optical disk is formed by illegally copying the record<br>
information and this optical disk is immediately ejected to<br>
the outside of ■ the information recording/reproducing<br>
apparatus S (step S22) . Thus, the reproducing processing<br>
including the loading processing is completed.<br>
On the other hand, if the content of the detected<br>
first disk type information 145 is not "0000b"" in the<br>
determination of the step S16 (step S16; NO), then, it is<br>
confirmed whether its value is "0010b" to indicate the DVD-<br>
R 1R or not (step S18).<br>
Further, if the content of the first disk type<br>
information 145 is "0010b" (step S18; YES), then, it is<br>
determined whether the above described second disk type<br>
information 9 is "10b"' or not (step S19) .<br>
Therefore, when the second disk type information 9 is<br>
"10b" (step S19; YES), it is supposed that the normal DVD-R<br>
1R is currently loaded in the information recording<br>
reproducing apparatus S and the processing is shifted to<br>
the next reproducing processing.<br><br>
On one hand, if the second disk type information 9 is<br>
not "10b" in the determination of the step S19 (step S19;<br>
NO) , the type of the optical disk to be indicated by the<br>
first disk type information 145 and the type of the optical<br>
disk to be indicated by the second disk type information 9<br>
are different each other in the optical disk which are<br>
currently loaded in . the information recording/reproducing<br>
apparatus S, so that it is supposed that this optical disk<br>
is formed by illegally copying the record information and<br>
this optical disk is immediately ejected to the outside of<br>
the information recording/reproducing apparatus S (step<br>
S22) . Thus, the reproducing processing including the<br>
loading processing is completed.<br>
On the other hand, if the content of the detected disk<br>
type information 145 is "0010b" in the determination of the<br>
step S18 (step S18; NO), then, it is confirmed whether its<br>
value is "0011b" to indicate the DVD-RW or not (step S20).<br>
Further, if the content of the first disk type<br>
information 145 is "0011b" (step S20; YES), then, it is<br>
determined whether the above described second disk type<br>
information 9 is "lib" or not (step S21).<br>
Therefore, the second disk type information 9 is "lib"<br>
(step S21; YES), it is supposed that the normal DVD-RW is<br>
currently loaded in the information recording/reproducing<br>
apparatus S and the processing is shifted to the next<br>
reproducing processing.<br>
On one hand, if the second disk type information 9 is ..<br><br>
not "lib" in the determination of the step S21 (step S21;<br>
NO) , the type of the optical disk to be indicated by the<br>
first disk type information 145 and the type of the optical<br>
disk to be indicated by the second disk type information 9<br>
are different each other in the optical disk which are<br>
currently . loaded in the information recording/reproducing<br>
apparatus S, so that it is supposed that this optical disk<br>
is formed by illegally copying the record information and<br>
.this optical disk is immediately ejected to the outside of<br>
the information recording reproducing apparatus S (step<br>
S22) . Thus, the reproducing processing including the<br>
loading processing is completed.<br>
(B) An embodiment of.reproducing processing<br>
In the next place, the reproducing processing<br>
according to the embodiment, which is executed in<br>
succession to the above described loading processing, will<br>
be explained with reference to FIG. 10.<br>
As shown in FIG. 10, according to reproducing<br>
processing of the embodiment, at first, the above described<br>
starting information or the like and the VMGI 4 are read<br>
out from the optical disk, which is currently loaded within<br>
the information'recording/reproducing apparatus S, and the<br>
initial confirmation such as confirmation of the version<br>
number of the physical format on the basis of the read out<br>
VMGI 4 is executed (step S25).<br>
If the initial confirmation is completed, then, the<br>
content of the first disk type information 145 which is<br><br>
currently read out (step-S25) is confirmed, so that it is<br>
confirmed whether its value is "0000b" to indicate the DVD-<br>
ROM or not (step S26).<br>
If the content of the first disk type information 145<br>
is "0000b" (step S26; YES), then, reproduction of the<br>
record information recorded in the DVD-ROM .(detection from<br>
the optical disk) is started (step S27) and further, it is<br>
determined whether the above described second disk type<br>
information 88 within the DSI data 51 is "00b" or not (step<br>
S28) .<br>
Therefore, if the second disk type information 88 is<br>
"00b" (step S28; YES), it is supposed that the normal DVD-<br>
ROM is currently loaded in the information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus S and the reproducing<br>
processing is continued. In the next place, it is<br>
confirmed whether the operation to stop the reproducing<br>
operation is executed or not by the operating unit 133<br>
(step S29).<br>
If the stop operation is not executed (step S29; NO),<br>
the processing is returned to the step S27 so as to<br>
continue the reproducing processing as well as the value of<br>
the second disk type information 88 in respective DSI data<br>
51, which are sequentially obtained in accordance with the<br>
continuation of reproduction, is confirmed. On one hand,<br>
if the stop operation is executed (step S29; YES), the<br>
reproducing processing is stopped at that point (step S30)<br>
to complete a series of the reproducing processing. _<br><br>
On the other hand, if the second disk type information<br>
88 is not "00b" in the' determination of the step S28 (step<br>
S28;..NO), 'the type of the optical disk to be indicated by<br>
the first disk type information 145 and the type of the<br>
optical disk to be indicated by the second disk type<br>
information 88 are different each other in the optical disk<br>
which are currently loaded in the information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus S, so that it is highly<br>
potential that this optical disk is formed by illegally<br>
copying the record information and the reproducing<br>
processing for this optical disk is immediately stopped<br>
(step S31) . Simultaneously, this optical disk is ejected<br>
to the outside of the information recording/reproducing<br>
apparatus S (step S32) . Thus, the reproducing processing<br>
is completed.<br>
Further, if the content of the detected first disk<br>
type information 145 is not "0000b" in the determination of<br>
the step S26 (step S26; NO), then, it is confirmed whether<br>
its value is "0010b" to indicate the DVD-R 1R or not (step<br>
S33) .<br>
If the content of the first disk type information 145<br>
is "0010b" (step S33; YES), then, the reproduction of the<br>
record information which is recorded in the DVD-R 1R<br>
(detection from the optical disk) is started (step S34) .<br>
Further, it is determined whether the above described<br>
second disk type information 88 is "10b" or not (step S35).<br>
Therefore, if the second disk type information 88 is<br><br>
"10b" (step S35; YES), it is supposed that the normal DVD-R<br>
1R is currently loaded in the information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus S and the reproducing<br>
processing is continued. In the next place, it is<br>
confirmed whether the operation to stop the reproducing<br>
processing is executed or not by the operating unit 133<br>
(step S36) .<br>
If the stop operation is not performed (step S36; NO),<br>
the processing is returned to the step S34 so as to<br>
continue the reproducing processing as well as the value of<br>
the second disk type information 88 in respective DSI data<br>
51, which are sequentially obtained in accordance with the<br>
continuation of reproduction, is confirmed. On one hand,<br>
the stop operation is executed (step S36; YES), the<br>
reproducing processing is stopped at that point (step S30)<br>
to complete a series of the reproducing processing.<br>
On the- other hand., if the second disk type information<br>
88 is not "10b" in the determination of the step S35 (step<br>
S28; NO), the type of the optical disk to be indicated by<br>
the first disk type information 145 and the type of the<br>
optical disk to be indicated by the second disk type<br>
information 88 are different each other in the optical disk<br>
which are currently loaded in the information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus S, so that it is highly<br>
potential that this optical disk is formed by illegally<br>
copying the record information and the reproducing<br>
processing for this optical disk is stopped (step S31) .<br><br>
Simultaneously, this optical disk is immediately ejected to<br>
the outside . of the information recording/reproducing<br>
apparatus S (step S32). Thus, the reproducing processing<br>
is completed.<br>
On one hand, if the content of the detected first disk<br>
type information 145 is "0010b" in the determination of the<br>
step S33 (step S33; NO), then, it is confirmed whether its<br>
value is "0011b" to indicate the DVD-RW or not (step S37).<br>
If the content of the first disk type information 145<br>
is "0011b" (step S37; YES), then, the reproduction of the<br>
record information which is recorded in the DVD-R 1R<br>
(detection from the optical disk) is started (step S38) .<br>
Further, it is determined whether the above described<br>
second disk type information 88 is "lib" or not (step S39).<br>
Therefore, if the second disk type information 88 is<br>
"lib" (step S39; YES), it is supposed that the normal DVD-<br>
RW is currently loaded in the information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus S and the reproducing<br>
processing is continued. In the next place, it is<br>
confirmed whether the operation to stop the reproducing<br>
processing is executed or not by the operating unit 133<br>
(step S40).<br>
If the stop operation is not executed (step S40; NO),<br>
the processing is returned to the step S38 so as to<br>
continue the reproducing processing as well as the value of<br>
the second disk type information 88 in respective DSi data<br>
51, which are sequentially obtained in accordance with the<br><br>
continuation of reproduction, is confirmed. On one hand,<br>
the stop operation is executed (step S40; YES), the<br>
reproducing processing is stopped at that point (step S30)<br>
to complete a series of the reproducing processing.<br>
On the other hand, if the second disk type information<br>
88 is not "lib" in the determination of the step S39 (step<br>
S39; NO), the type of the optical disk to be indicated by<br>
the first disk type information 145 and the type of the<br>
optical disk to be indicated by the second disk type<br>
information 88 are different each other in the optical disk<br>
which are currently ■ loaded in the information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus S, so that it is highly<br>
potential that this optical disk is formed by illegally<br>
copying the record information and the reproducing<br>
processing for this optical disk is immediately stopped<br>
(step S31) . Simultaneously, this optical disk is ejected<br>
to the outside of the information recording/reproducing<br>
apparatus S (step S32). Thus, the reproducing processing<br>
is completed.<br>
At the last, if the content of the detected first disk<br>
type information 145 is neither "0011b" in the<br>
determination in. the step S37 (step S37; NO), it is<br>
supposed that the optical disk, which is currently loaded<br>
in the information recording/reproducing apparatus S, is an<br>
optical disk of a type that can not be reproduced in the<br>
information recording/reproducing apparatus S (for example,<br>
the DVD-RAM) and the reproducing processing for this ..<br><br>
optical disk is immediately stopped (step S31)<br>
Simultaneously, this optical disk is ejected to the outside<br>
of the information recording reproducing apparatus S (step<br>
S32) to complete the reproducing processing.<br>
As described above, according to the recording<br>
processing and the reproducing processing in the<br>
information recording/reproducing processing of the<br>
embodiments, the second disk type information 9 and 88<br>
having the same contents as that of the first disk type<br>
information 145, which is recorded in advance, are recorded<br>
in the DVD-R 1R or DVD-RW, in which the first dick type<br>
information 145 is recorded. After that, the recording<br>
information is recorded in the DVD-R 1R or DVD-RW.<br>
Further, when recording information is reproduced, the<br>
record information is reproduced only when the first disk<br>
type information 145 and the second disk type information 9<br>
and 88 are equally related, so that it is possible to<br>
prohibit the illegal recording processing such that the<br>
second disk type information 9 or 88, which is different<br>
from the first disk type information 145, is recorded or to<br>
prohibit the reproduction of the record information, which<br>
is recorded by the illegal recording processing such that<br>
the second disk type information 9 or 88 is not recorded.<br>
Alternatively, since the second disk type information<br>
9 is recorded in the VMGI 4 and further, the second disk<br>
type information 88 is recorded in the DSI data 51, even if<br>
either one of the second disk type information 9 or 88 i_s<br><br>
interpolated, it is possible to certainly prohibit the<br>
reproduction of the recording information, which is<br>
recorded by the above described illegal recording<br>
processing, by using other one of the second disk ■ type<br>
information 9 or 88.<br>
(IV) Modified	embodiment	of	the	information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus<br>
Next, a modified embodiment of the information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus will explained with<br>
reference to FIGs. 11 to 14.<br>
According to the above described embodiments, a case<br>
such that the second disk type information 9 and 88 take<br>
different values for every detailed type of a disk is<br>
explained. However, in addition to this, a value to<br>
classify two types of the optical disk such as the DVD-ROM<br>
and the recordable DVD, for example, a value of the second<br>
disk type information 9 or 88 corresponding to the DVD-ROM<br>
may be ■ set to be "00b" and a value of the second disk type<br>
information 9 or 88 corresponding to the recordable DVD<br>
(namely, any one of the DVD-R, the DVD-RW or the DVD-RAM)<br>
may be set to be "01b".<br>
In this case, if the value of the first disk type<br>
information 145 is "0000b" to indicate the DVD-ROM and the<br>
value of the second disk type information 9 or 88 is "01b"<br>
to indicate the recordable DVD, it is preferable that the<br>
reproduction of this optical disk is stopped and the this<br>
optical disk is ejected to the outside since it is. highly „<br><br>
potential that this optical disk is formed by illegally<br>
copying the record information from the DVD-ROM to the<br>
recordable DVD..<br>
On one hand, if the value ■ of the first disk type<br>
information 145 is "0000b" to indicate the DVD-ROM and the<br>
value of the second disk type information 9 or 88 is also<br>
"00b" to indicate the DVD-ROM, or if the value of the first<br>
disk type information 145 is any one of "0001b", "0010b" or<br>
"0011b" to indicate the recordable DVD and the value of the<br>
second disk type information 9 or 88 is also "01b" to<br>
indicate .the recordable DVD, the record information<br>
recorded in this optical disk is supposed to be normal and<br>
the reproduction thereof is performed.<br>
Next, the operation of the information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus according to the modified<br>
embodiment will be explained in detail.<br>
By using a DVD-R having a different structure from the<br>
DVD-R 1R, which is used in the information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus S according to the above-<br>
mentioned embodiment, the operation of the information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus according to the modified<br>
embodiment will be explained below. Therefore, at first,<br>
the structure of the DVD-R will be explained with reference<br>
to FIG. 11. FIG. 11 illustrates a plan external view and a<br>
physical recording format of the DVD-R after recording the<br>
record information is completed, according to the modified<br>
embodiment.<br><br>
As shown in FIG. 11, a DVD-R 1R' according to the<br>
modified embodiment is provided with a non-recording area<br>
110, a beam strength test area 111, a managing data area<br>
112, a lead-in area LIA, a file system information area FS,<br>
a data area DA, a lead-out area LOA and a terminal area EA<br>
as same as the DVD-R 1R according to the above described<br>
embodiment. Further, the record information recorded in<br>
the data area DA is structured in such a manner that a<br>
plurality of sector information is continued as a unit of<br>
information ST.<br>
Then, one of sector information ST is comprised of:<br>
identification information ID for identifying the present<br>
sector information ST itself within the record information;<br>
error correcting information IED for correcting the<br>
detection error of the present identification information<br>
ID upon reproducing the record information; characteristic<br>
information CP for indicating a characteristic belonged to<br>
the information, which is included in the present sector<br>
information ST; main information MD as the information<br>
included in the present sector information ST itself; and<br>
error detecting information EDC for detecting the detection<br>
error of entirety of the sector information ST upon<br>
reproducing the recording information in sequence from a<br>
head address thereof.<br>
In this case, in the structure of the characteristic<br>
information CP, when the DVD-R 1R' comprises a DVD-R 1R' to<br>
be generally circulated (hereinafter, the DVD-R 1R' is<br><br>
merely referred to'" as a G (General) type DVD-R), as shown<br>
in the symbol (a) of FIG. 11, according to its address<br>
structure, the above described characteristic information<br>
CP is comprised in such a manner that, data type<br>
information ADP, which indicates whether the record<br>
information recorded in the G type DVD-R 1R' comprises the<br>
video information mainly composed of the image information<br>
or not, exists between two preparatory information R<br>
without any significant information (hereinafter, a<br>
structure of the characteristic information CP shown in the<br>
symbol (a) of FIG. 11 is referred to as a second format).<br>
On the contrary, if for example the DVD-R 1R'<br>
comprises a DVD-R 1R' (hereinafter, the DVD-R 1R' is merely<br>
referred to as an A (Authoring) type DVD-R) to be used only<br>
by a producer of the record information for the user of a<br>
test or the like, as shown in symbol (b) of FIG. 11,<br>
according its address structure, the present characteristic<br>
information CP includes the copy right information CCI<br>
(namely, the copy right information to indicate the number<br>
of times that the record information recorded in the A type<br>
DVD-R 1R' is capable of being copied and the reproduction<br>
limitation state or the like of the record information<br>
recorded in the A type DVD-R 1R') at its head. Further,<br>
the interior of the characteristic information CP other<br>
than the copy right information CCI is defined as the<br>
preparatory information R, which does not include any<br>
significant information (hereinafter, a structure of the<br><br>
characteristic information CP shown in symbol (b) of FIG.<br>
11 is referred to as a first format).<br>
Alternatively, with respect to the above described<br>
characteristic information CP, other than the above<br>
described G type DVD-R 1R' , the structure of the<br>
characteristic information CP within the record information<br>
recorded in the DVD-RW and the DVD-RAM is defined as the<br>
above described second format. On the other hand, the<br>
structure of the characteristic information CP in the<br>
record information recorded in the DVD-ROM other than the<br>
above described A type DVD-R is defined as the above<br>
described first format. Alternatively, specifically, a<br>
content of the above described data type information ADP is<br>
defined as "01b" when the record information recorded in<br>
the DVD, in which the data type information ADP is<br>
recorded, is the video information. On the other hand, if<br>
this record information is not the video information (for<br>
example, this record information comprises only the audio<br>
information such as the music information), a content of<br>
the above described data type information ADP is defined as<br>
"00b".<br>
In the next place, by using the DVD-R 1R' having the<br>
above described structure, the operation of an information<br>
recording reproducing apparatus according to the modified<br>
embodiment will be explained.<br>
(i) A modified embodiment for recording processing<br><br>
. In the next place, the recording processing of the<br>
record information in the information recording/reproducing<br>
apparatus according to the modified embodiment will' be<br>
specifically explained with reference to FIG. 12.<br>
Alternatively, the recording .processing to be explained<br>
below comprises normal (not illegal) recording processing<br>
to be executed as. a DVD capable of recording the<br>
information (namely, any DVD capable of recording the<br>
information including the above described DVD-R 1R' and the<br>
DVD-RAM) is loaded in the information recording/reproducing<br>
apparatus according to the modified embodiment.<br>
Alternatively, FIG. 12 is a flow chart for illustrating<br>
the recording processing. With respect to the same<br>
operation as the recording processing in the information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus S according to the above<br>
described embodiment with reference to FIG. 8, the<br>
identical step numerals are given and the detailed<br>
explanations thereof are omitted.<br>
As shown in FIG. 12, in the recording processing<br>
according to the modified embodiment, if the above<br>
described DVD-R 1R' or the like is loaded and the<br>
instruction to start the recording processing is executed<br>
by an operating unit 133, at first, the first disk type<br>
information 145 which has been already recorded in the<br>
present loaded DVD-R 1R' or the like is detected as same as<br>
the above described embodiment (step Si).<br><br>
In the next place, a content of the detected 'first<br>
disk type information 145 is confirmed (step S50) . Then,<br>
if its value is "0011b" to indicate that the loaded DVD is<br>
a DVD-RW or its value is "0001b" to indicate that the<br>
loaded DVD is a DVD-RAM (step S50; YES), the second disk<br>
type information 9 (the second disk type information<br>
included in the VMGI 4) and the second disk type class<br>
information 88 (the second disk type information included<br>
in the DSI data 51) are set as "01b", respectively, in a<br>
navigation information generator 126 (step S54). Further,<br>
a content of the characteristic information CP is set as<br>
the above described second format as well as the data type<br>
information ADP is set as "01b" in the navigation<br>
information generator 126 (step S55) and the recording of<br>
the record information is started in the same way as the<br>
above described embodiment (step S4).<br>
On one hand, under the determination in the above<br>
described step S50, if a content of the first disk type<br>
information 145 is not "0011b" nor "0001b" (step S50; NO),<br>
then, it is confirmed whether a content of the first disk<br>
type information 145 is "0010b" to indicate the loaded DVD<br>
is a DVD-R 1R' or not (step S2). If the content is "0010b"<br>
(step S2; YES), then, it is confirmed whether this DVD-R<br>
1R' is the above described A type DVD-R or not (step S51).<br>
If it is not the A type DVD-R (step S51; NO), the<br>
processing is shifted to the above described step S54 and<br>
S55 as it is.	■. - -<br><br>
On the other Hand, under the determination in the step<br>
S51, if the loaded DVD-R 1R' is the A type DVD-R (step S51;<br>
YES), the second disk type information 9 and 88 are set as<br>
"00b", respectively, in the navigation information<br>
generator 126 (step S52). Further, a content of the<br>
characteristic information CP is set as the above described<br>
first format in the navigation information generator 126<br>
(step S53) and the recording of the record information is<br>
started (step S4).<br>
In step S52 shown in FIG. 12, the second disk type<br>
information 9 and 88' are set as "00b", which originally<br>
indicates the DVD-ROM, even though the DVD loaded in the<br>
information recording/reproducing apparatus of the modified<br>
embodiment is the A type DVD-R. That is because this A<br>
type DVD-R is not sold to a consumer but used only' for a<br>
test upon producing the DVD-ROM, so that it is supposed<br>
that it is enough that A type DVD-R functions only as the<br>
DVD-ROM in terms of the DVD for the test.<br>
Then, it is confirmed whether the operation to stop<br>
the recording processing is performed in the operating unit<br>
133 or not (step S5). If it is not performed (step S5;<br>
NO), the processing returns to the step S4 to continue the<br>
recording processing. On one hand, if the stop operation<br>
is performed (step S5; YES), the recording processing is<br>
stopped (step S6) at this point and a series of recording<br>
processing is terminated.'<br><br>
On the other hand, under the determination of the step<br>
S2, if a content of the detected first disk type<br>
information 145 is not "0010b" (step S2; NO), it turns out<br>
that a content of the first disk type information 145 is<br>
not any one of "0001b", "0010b" and "0011b". In this case,<br>
since a DVD which is loaded at present is the DVD-ROM-<br>
(namely, a DVD to indicate that a content of the first disk<br>
type information 145 is "0000b"), the recording processing<br>
is immediately stopped.<br>
Alternatively, in the above described illegal<br>
recording processing, the processing in the steps S52 and<br>
S54 shown in FIG. 12 are not performed. As a result, in an<br>
optical disk, in which the present illegal recording<br>
processing is performed, as same as the above described<br>
embodiment, a content of the first disk type information<br>
145 is different from a content of the second disk type<br>
information 9 and 88 or the second disk type information 9<br>
and 88 are not recorded at all.<br>
(ii) An embodiment of the reproducing processing<br>
In the next place, the reproducing processing<br>
according to the modified embodiment to reproduce the<br>
recording information in a DVD-R 1R' or DVD-RW, in which<br>
the present record information is recorded by the recording<br>
processing shown in FIG. 12, will be specifically explained<br>
with reference to FIG. 13 and FIG. 14.<br>
(A) A modified embodiment of the loading processing<br><br>
At first, upon reproducing the recording information,<br>
the processing in the case that the DVD-R 1R' or DVD-RW is<br>
loaded in the information recording reproducing apparatus<br>
according to the modified embodiment will be explained with<br>
reference to FIG. 13 below.<br>
Alternatively, FIG. 13 is a flow chart for<br>
illustrating the present loading processing. With respect<br>
to the same operation as the loading processing in the<br>
information recording/reproducing apparatus S according to<br>
the above described embodiment with reference to FIG. 9,<br>
the identical step numerals are given and the detailed<br>
explanations thereof are 'omitted.<br>
As shown in FIG. 13, in the loading processing<br>
according to the modified embodiment, at first, the<br>
processing from the loading processing (step S10) among the<br>
loading processing according to the embodiment, which was<br>
explained with reference to FIG. 9, to the confirming<br>
processing of a content in the first disk type information<br>
145 (step S16) are performed.<br>
In the next place, under the determination of the step<br>
S16, if a content of the first disk type information 145 is<br>
"0000b" (step S16; YES), the present loaded DVD is the DVD-<br>
ROM. Then, the above described characteristic information<br>
CP is extracted from the 'sector information ST in the<br>
recording information recorded in the DVD-ROM and it is<br>
confirmed whether a content of the above described data<br><br>
type information ADP, which is included in the<br>
characteristic information CP, is "01b" or not (step S60).<br>
Further, if a content of the confirmed .data type<br>
information ADP is "01b" (step S60; YES), since the data<br>
type information ADP is originally not defined by the DVD-<br>
ROM and the A type DVD-R (refer to FIG. 11), it is<br>
originally impossible that a content of the first disk type<br>
information 145, which is confirmed in the step S16, is<br>
"0000b" and its data type information ADP is "01b".<br>
Therefore, in this case, it is assumed that an optical<br>
disk, in which any illegal processing is performed, is<br>
probably loaded at present, so that this optical disk is<br>
immediately ejected from the information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus (step S22) and the<br>
reproducing processing including the loading processing is<br>
terminated.<br>
On one hand, under the determination of the step S60,<br>
if a content of the confirmed data type information ADP is<br>
not "01b" (step S60; NO), in this case, it is assumed that<br>
a normal DVD-ROM is loaded at present, and then, it is<br>
determined that the above described second disk type<br>
information 9 in the VMGI 4 is "00b" or not (step S17).<br>
Therefore, if the second disk type information 9 is<br>
"00b" (step S17; YES), it is assumed that the normal DVD-<br>
ROM is loaded in the information recording/reproducing<br>
apparatus S at present, so that the loading processing is<br>
terminated to shift to the next reproducing processing.<br><br>
On one hand, under the determination of the step S17,<br>
if the second disk type information 9 is not "00b" (step<br>
S17; NO), it is assumed that a class of the optical disk<br>
which is indicated" by the first disk type information 145<br>
is different from a type of the optical disk which is<br>
indicated by the second disk type information 9 in the<br>
present loaded optical disk and this optical disk is highly<br>
possibly formed by illegally copying the record information<br>
therein, so that this optical disk is immediately ejected<br>
from the information recording/reproducing apparatus (step<br>
S22) to terminate the reproducing processing including the<br>
loading processing.<br>
On the other hand, under the determination of the step<br>
»<br>
S16, if a content of the detected first disk type<br>
information 145 is not "0000b"(step S16; NO), then, it is<br>
confirmed whether its value is "0011b" to indicate a DVD-RW<br>
or "0001b" to indicate a DVD-RAM or not (step S61).<br>
In the next place, under the determination of the step<br>
S61, if a content of the first disk type information 145 is<br>
not "0001b" or "0011b" (step S61; NO), then, it is<br>
confirmed whether its value is "0010b" to indicate a DVD-R<br>
1R' or not (step S62).<br>
Further, if a • content of the first disk type<br>
information 145 is "0010b" (step S62; YES), then, it is<br>
confirmed whether the present loaded DVD-R 1R' is a G type<br>
DVD-R or not (step S63) .<br><br>
Alternatively, ..if a content of the first disk type<br>
information 145 is neither "0010b" (step S62; NO), the<br>
present loaded DVD is a DVD, which is not belonged to any<br>
normal type, so that, in this case, it is assumed that the<br>
present optical disk is an unauthentic optical disk and<br>
this optical disk is immediately ejected from the<br>
information recording/reproducing apparatus (step S22) to<br>
terminate the reproducing processing including the loading<br>
processing.<br>
In the next place, under the determination of the step<br>
S63, if the present loaded DVD-R 1R' is not the G type DVD-<br>
R (step S63, NO), further, it is confirmed whether the<br>
present DVD-R 1R' is the A type DVD-R or not (step S64).<br>
Further, if the present loaded DVD-R 1R' is neither<br>
the A type DVD-R (step S64; NO), the present loaded DVD-<br>
R1R' is neither the G type DVD-R .nor the A type DVD-R<br>
despite that the present loaded DVD-R 1R' is determined to<br>
be a DVD-R 1R'. Therefore, in this case, assuming that the<br>
present optical disk is highly possibly formed by illegally<br>
copying the record information therein, this optical disk<br>
is immediately ejected from the information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus (step S22) to terminate the<br>
reproducing processing including the-loading processing.<br>
On one hand, if the present loaded DVD is the A type<br>
DVD-R under the determination of the step S64 (step S64;<br>
YES) , then, it is confirmed whether the encryption<br>
processing is provided to the record information recorded<br><br>
in the present loaded A type DVD-R or not (step S65) . If<br>
it is encrypted (step S65; YES), assuming that its record<br>
information is protected by the copyright and this record<br>
information should not be reproduced, the present loaded<br>
DVD-R 1R' is immediately ejected from the information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus (step S22) to terminate the<br>
reproducing processing including the loading processing.<br>
On the other hand, if it is not encrypted (step S65; NO),<br>
then, the above described characteristic information CP is<br>
extracted from the sector information ST in the record<br>
information recorded in the present loaded A type DVD-R and<br>
it is confirmed whether a content of the above described<br>
data type information ADP included in the characteristic<br>
information CP is "01b" or not (step S66).<br>
Further, if the content of the confirmed data type<br>
information ADP ' is "01b" (step S66; YES), as described<br>
above, since the data type information ADP is not defined<br>
by the DVD-ROM and the A type DVD-R (refer to FIG. 11), it<br>
is not originally impossible that the content confirmed in<br>
the step S64 is the A type DVD-R as well as its data type<br>
information ADP is "01b": Therefore, in this case,<br>
assuming that the present loaded DVD-R is probably an<br>
optical disk provided with any illegal processing, this<br>
optical disk is immediately ejected from the information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus (step S22) to terminate the<br>
reproducing, processing including the loading processing.-<br><br>
On one hand, under the determination of the step S66,<br>
if the content of the confirmed data type information ADP<br>
is not "01b" (step S66; NO), assuming that the normal A<br>
type DVD-R.is loaded at.present in this case, then, it is<br>
determined whether the second disk type information 9 in<br>
the VMGI 4 is "00b" or not (step S17).<br>
Therefore, if the second disk type information 9 is<br>
not "00b" (step S17; NO), it is assumed that the normal A<br>
type DVD-R is loaded in the information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus at present to shift to the<br>
next reproducing processing.<br>
On one hand,-under the determination of the step S17,<br>
if the second disk type information 9 is "00b" (step S17;<br>
YES) , in the present loaded optical disk, a type of the<br>
DVD, which is indicated by the first disk type information<br>
145, is different from the type of the DVD, which is<br>
indicated by the second disk type information 9, so that<br>
this DVD is highly possibly an optical disk formed by<br>
illegally copying the record information therein. Then,<br>
this optical disk is immediately ejected from the<br>
information recording/reproducing apparatus (step S22) and<br>
the reproducing processing including the loading processing<br>
is terminated.<br>
In step S17 shown in FIG. 13, the same determination<br>
as that of step S7 in FIG. 9 is performed, even though the<br>
DVD, which is loaded in the information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus of the modified embodiment<br><br>
and is the object of the determination, is the A type DVD-<br>
R. That is because this A type DVD-R is not sold to a<br>
consumer but used only, for a test upon producing the DVD-<br>
ROM, so that it. is supposed that it is enough that A type<br>
DVD-R functions only as the DVD-ROM in terms of the DVD for<br>
the test.<br>
On the other hand, under the determination of the<br>
above described step S61, if a content of the first disk<br>
type information 145 is any of "0001b" or "0011b" (step<br>
S61; YES) or under the determination of the above described<br>
S63, if the present loaded DVD-R 1R' is confirmed to be the<br>
G type DVD-R (step S63; YES), then, it is confirmed whether<br>
the encryption processing is provided to the record<br>
information recorded in respective DVD or not (step S67) .<br>
Further, if it is encrypted (step S67; YES), assuming that<br>
its record information is protected by the copyright and<br>
this record information should not be reproduced, this<br>
optical disk is immediately ejected from the information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus (step S22) to terminate the<br>
reproducing processing including the loading processing.<br>
On one hand, if it is not encrypted (step S67; NO), then,<br>
the above described characteristic information CP is<br>
extracted from the sector information ST in the record<br>
information recorded in the present loaded DVD and it is<br>
confirmed whether a content of the above described data<br>
type information ADP is "01b" or not (step S68).<br><br>
Then, if the -content of the confirmed data type<br>
information ADP is not "01b" (step S68; NO), as described<br>
above, since the data type information ADP is defined only-<br>
in the case that the video information is recorded in the<br>
DVD-RW, the DVD-RAM or the G type DVD-R (refer to FIG. 11),<br>
the content which is confirmed in the step S61 or the step<br>
S63 is not identical with the content which is confirmed in<br>
the step S68. Therefore, in this case, assuming that the<br>
present loaded optical disk is probably an optical disk<br>
provided with any illegal processing, this optical disk is<br>
immediately ejected from the information recording<br>
reproducing apparatus (step S22) to terminate the<br>
reproducing processing including the loading processing.<br>
On one hand, if the content of the confirmed data type<br>
information ADP is "01b" (step S68; YES), it is perceived<br>
that the content, which is confirmed in the step S61 or the<br>
step S63, is appropriate as the normal DVD-RW, DVD-RAM or<br>
DVD-R, so that, in the next place, it is determined whether<br>
the above described second disk type information 9 is "01b"<br>
or not (step S69).<br>
Therefore, if the second disk type information 9 is<br>
"01b" (step S69; YES), it is assumed that any one of the G<br>
type DVD-R, the DVD-RW or the DVD-RAM which are capable of<br>
reproducing the record information normally is loaded in<br>
the information recording/reproducing apparatus at present<br>
to shift to the next reproducing processing.<br><br>
On the other hand, under the determination of the step<br>
S69, if the second disk type information 9 is not "01b"<br>
(step S69; NO), in the present loaded optical disk, a type<br>
of the optical disk, which is indicated by the first disk<br>
type information 145, is different from the type of the<br>
optical disk, which is indicated by the second disk type<br>
information 9, so that this optical disk is highly possibly<br>
a DVD formed- by illegally copying the record information<br>
therein. Then, this optical disk is immediately ejected<br>
from the information recording/reproducing apparatus (step<br>
S22) and the reproducing processing including the loading<br>
processing is terminated.<br>
(B) A modified embodiment of the reproducing processing<br>
At last, the reproducing processing according to the<br>
modified embodiment to be performed in succession to the<br>
above described loading processing will be explained wi.th<br>
reference to FIG. 14.<br>
Alternatively, FIG. 14 is a flow chart for<br>
illustrating the present reproducing processing. With<br>
respect to the same operation as the reproducing processing<br>
in the information recording/reproducing apparatus S<br>
according to the above described embodiment with reference<br>
to FIG. 10, the identical step numerals are given and the<br>
detailed explanations thereof are omitted.<br>
As shown in FIG. 14, in the reproducing processing<br>
according to the modified embodiment, at first, the<br>
processing from the initial confirming processing (step<br><br>
S25) among the reproducing processing according to	the<br>
embodiment, which was explained with reference to FIG.	10,<br>
to the reproduction starting processing (step S27)	are<br>
performed.<br>
Then, if the reproduction is started, the above<br>
described characteristic information CP is extracted from<br>
the sector information ST in the record information<br>
recorded in the DVD-ROM, which is confirmed in the step<br>
S26, and it is confirmed whether a content of the above<br>
described data type information ADP, which is included<br>
therein, is "01b" or not (step S75).<br>
Further, if the content of the confirmed data type<br>
information ADP is "01b" (step S75; YES), as described<br>
above, the data type information ADP is not defined in the<br>
DVD-ROM and the A type DVD-R (refer to FIG. 11), so that it<br>
is originally impossible that a content of the first disk<br>
type information 145 confirmed in the step S26 is "0000b"<br>
and its data type information ADP is "01b". Therefore, in<br>
this case, assuming that there is a possibility that the<br>
optical disk provided with any illegal processing is loaded<br>
at present, the reproducing: processing of this optical disk<br>
is immediately stopped (step S31) as well as this optical<br>
disk is ejected from the information recording/reproducing<br>
apparatus S (step S32) to terminate the reproducing<br>
processing including the loading processing.<br>
On one hand, under the determination of the step S75,<br>
if the content of the confirmed data type information ADP<br><br>
is not "01b" (step S75; NO), assuming that the normal DVD-<br>
ROM is loaded at present in this case, then, it is<br>
determined whether the above described second disk type<br>
information 88 in the DSI data 51 is "00b" or not (step<br>
S28) .<br>
. Therefore, if the second disk type information 88 is<br>
"00b" (step S28; YES), the reproducing processing is<br>
continued as assuming that the normal DVD-ROM is loaded in<br>
the information recording/reproducing apparatus, then, it<br>
is confirmed whether the operation to stop the reproducing<br>
processing is performed in the operating unit 133 or not<br>
(step S29) .<br>
Further, if the stop operation is not performed (step<br>
S29; NO) , the processing is returned to the step S27 to<br>
continue the reproducing processing as well as a value of<br>
the second disk type information 88 in respective DSI data<br>
51, which are sequentially obtained in accordance with the<br>
continuation of the reproduction, is confirmed. On one<br>
hand, if the stop operation is performed (step S29; YES),<br>
the reproducing processing is stopped as it is (step S30)<br>
and a series of the reproducing processing is terminated.<br>
On the other hand, under the determination of the step<br>
S28, if the second disk type information 88 is not "00b"<br>
(step S28; NO), in the present loaded optical disk, the<br>
type of the optical disk, which is indicated by the first<br>
disk type information 145, is. different from the type of<br>
the optical disk, which is indicated by the second -disk -<br><br>
type information 88, so that it is assumed that this DVD is<br>
highly possibly an optical disk formed by illegally copying<br>
the record information therein and the reproducing<br>
processing of this optical disk is immediately stopped<br>
(step S31) as well as this optical disk is ejected from the<br>
information recording/reproducing apparatus S (step S32) to<br>
terminate the reproducing processing.<br>
On one hand, under the determination of the step S26,<br>
if the content of the detected first disk type information<br>
145 is not "0000b" (step S26; NO), then, it is confirmed<br>
whether its value is "0011b" to indicate the DVD-RW or<br>
vv0001b" to indicate the DVD-RAM or not (step S76) .<br>
Further, under the determination of the step S76, if a<br>
content of the first disk type information 145 is not<br>
"0001b" or "0011b" (step S76; NO), then, it is confirmed<br>
whether its value is "0010b" to indicate the DVD-R1R' or<br>
not (step S77) .<br>
Then, if a content of the first disk type information<br>
145 is "0011b" (step S76; YES), then, it is confirmed<br>
whether the present loaded DVD-R 1R' is the G type DVD-R or<br>
not (step S78).<br>
Alternatively, if a content of the first disk type<br>
information 145 is neither "0010b" (step S77; NO), it is<br>
perceived that the present loaded DVD is a DVD which is not<br>
belonged to any one of the normal types. Therefore, in<br>
this case, assuming that the present optical disk is an<br>
unauthentic optical disk, the reproducing processing of<br><br>
- this optical disk is immediately stopped (step S31) as well<br>
as this optical disk is ejected from the information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus S (step S3 2) to terminate<br>
the reproducing processing.<br>
In the next place, under the determination of the step<br>
S78, if the present loaded DVD-R 1R' is not the G type DVD-<br>
R (step S78; NO), further, it is confirmed whether the<br>
present DVD-R 1R' is the A type DVD-R or not (step S79).<br>
Then, if the present loaded DVD-R 1R' is neither the A<br>
type DVD-R (step S79; NO), it is perceived that the present<br>
loaded DVD is neither the G type DVD-R nor the A type DVD-R<br>
despite that the present loaded DVD is determined to be the<br>
DVD-R 1R' according to the first disk type information 145.<br>
Therefore, in this case, assuming that the present optical<br>
disk is highly possibly an optical disk formed by illegally<br>
copying the record information, the reproducing processing<br>
to this optical disk is immediately stopped (step S31) as<br>
well as this optical disk is ejected from the information<br>
recording reproducing apparatus S (step S32) to terminate<br>
the reproducing processing.<br>
On one hand, under the determination of the step S79,<br>
if the present loaded DVD is the A type DVD-R (step S79;<br>
YES) , then, the reproduction of the record information<br>
recorded in the present loaded DVD (detection from the A<br>
type DVD-R) is started (step S34), further, it is confirmed<br>
whether the record information recorded in the present A<br>
type DVD-R is provided with the encrypting processing or<br><br>
not (step S80) . Further, if it is encrypted (step S80;<br>
YES) , assuming that this record, information is protected<br>
by the copyright and this record information should not be<br>
reproduced, the reproducing processing to this DVD-R 1R' is<br>
immediately stopped (step S31) as well as this DVD-R 1R' is<br>
ejected from the information recording/reproducing<br>
apparatus (step S32) to terminate the reproducing<br>
processing. On the other hand, if it is ' not encrypted<br>
(step S80; NO), then, the above described characteristic<br>
information CP is extracted from the sector information ST<br>
in the record information recorded in the present loaded A<br>
type DVD-R and it is confirmed whether a content of the<br>
above described data type information- ADP included in the<br>
characteristic information CP is "01b" or not (step S81).<br>
Then, if the content of the confirmed data type<br>
information ADP is "01b" (step S81; YES), as described<br>
above, since the data type information ADP is not defined<br>
by the DVD-ROM and the A type DVD-R (refer to FIG. 11), it<br>
is originally impossible that the content confirmed in the<br>
step S79 is the A type DVD-R as well as its data type<br>
information ADP is "01b".' Therefore, in this case,<br>
assuming that the present loaded DVD-R is probably an<br>
optical disk provided with any illegal processing, the<br>
reproducing processing to this optical disk is immediately<br>
stopped (step S31) as well as this optical disk is ejected<br>
from the information recording/reproducing apparatus S<br>
(step S32) to terminate the reproducing processing.<br><br>
On one hand, under the determination of the step S81,<br>
if the content of the confirmed data type information ADP<br>
is not "01b" (step S81; NO), assuming that .the normal A<br>
type DVD-R is loaded at present in this case, then, it is<br>
determined whether the second disk type information 88 in<br>
the DSI data 51 is "00b" or not (step S82) .<br>
Therefore, if the second disk type information 88 is<br>
not "00b" (step S82; NO), it is assumed that the normal A<br>
type DVD-R is loaded in the information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus at present to continue the<br>
reproducing processing. Then, it is confirmed whether the<br>
operation to stop the reproducing processing is performed<br>
in the operating unit 133 or not (step S36).<br>
Further, if the stop operation is not performed is not<br>
performed (step S36; NO), the processing is returned to the<br>
step S34 to continue the reproducing processing as well as<br>
a value of the second disk type information 88 in<br>
respective DSI data 51, which are sequentially obtained in<br>
accordance with the continuation of the reproduction, is<br>
confirmed. On one hand, if the stop operation is performed<br>
(step S36; YES), the reproducing processing is stopped as<br>
it is (step S30) and a series of the reproducing processing<br>
is terminated.<br>
On the other hand, under the determination of the step<br>
S82, if the second disk type information 88 is "00b" (step<br>
S82; YES), in the present loaded optical disk, the class of<br>
the optical disk, which is indicated by the first disk type<br><br>
information 145, is different from the type, of the optical<br>
disk, which is indicated by the second disk type<br>
information 88, so that it is assumed that this optical<br>
disk is highly possibly an optical disk formed by illegally<br>
copying the record information therein and the reproducing<br>
processing of this optical disk is immediately stopped<br>
(step S31) as well as this optical disk is ejected from the<br>
information recording reproducing apparatus S (step S32) to<br>
terminate the reproducing processing.<br>
In step S82 shown in FIG. 14, the same determination<br>
as that of step S7 in FIG. 9 is performed, even though the<br>
DVD, which- is loaded in the information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus of the modified embodiment<br>
and is the object of the determination, is the A type DVD-<br>
R. That is because this A type DVD-R is not sold to a<br>
consumer but used only for a test upon producing the DVD-<br>
ROM, so that it is supposed that it is enough that A type<br>
DVD-R functions only as the DVD-ROM in terms of the DVD for<br>
the test.<br>
On one hand, under the determination of the above<br>
described step S76, if a content of the first disk type<br>
information 145 is any one of "0001b" or "0011b" (step S76,<br>
YES) or under the determination of the above described step<br>
S78, the present loaded DVD-R 1R' is the G type DVD-R (step<br>
S78; YES), then, the reproduction of the recording<br>
information recorded in the present loaded DVD (detection<br>
from the DVD) is started (step S34), further, it is<br><br>
confirmed whether the record information recorded in<br>
respective DVD are provided with the encrypting processing<br>
or not (step S83),. Further, if it is encrypted (step S83;<br>
YES), assuming that this record information is protected by<br>
the copyright and this record information should not be<br>
reproduced, the reproducing processing to this DVD is<br>
immediately stopped (step S31) as well as this DVD is<br>
ejected from the information recording/reproducing<br>
apparatus (step S32) to terminate the reproducing<br>
processing. On the other hand, if it is not encrypted<br>
(step S83; NO), then, the above described characteristic<br>
information CP is extracted from the sector information ST<br>
in the record information recorded in the present loaded<br>
DVD and it is confirmed whether a content of the' above<br>
described data type information ADP included in the<br>
characteristic information CP is "01b" or not (step S84).<br>
Then, if the content of the confirmed data type.<br>
information ADP is not "01b" (step S84; NO), as described<br>
above, since the data type information ADP is defined only<br>
in the DVD-RW, the DVD-RAM or the G type DVD-R (refer to<br>
FIG. 11), the content which is confirmed in the step S76 or<br>
the step S78 is not identical with the content which is<br>
confirmed in the step S84. Therefore, in this case,<br>
assuming that the present loaded optical disk is probably<br>
an optical disk provided with any illegal processing, the<br>
reproducing processing to this DVD is immediately stopped<br>
(step S31) as well as this DVD is immediately ejected from<br><br>
the information recording/reproducing apparatus (step S32)<br>
to terminate the reproducing processing including the<br>
loading processing.<br>
On one hand, if the content of the confirmed data type<br>
information ADP is "01b" (step S84; YES), it is perceived<br>
that the content, which is confirmed in the step S76 or the<br>
step S78, is appropriate as the normal DVD-RW, DVD-RAM or<br>
DVD-R, so that, in the next place, it is determined whether<br>
the above described second disk type information 88 is<br>
"01b" or not (step S85).<br>
Therefore, if the second disk type information 88 is<br>
"01b" (step S85; YES), it is assumed that any one of the G<br>
type DVD-R, the DVD-RW or the DVD-RAM which are capable of<br>
reproducing the record information normally is loaded in<br>
the information recording/reproducing apparatus at present<br>
to continue the reproducing processing. Then, it is<br>
confirmed whether the operation to stop the reproducing<br>
processing is performed in the operating unit 133 or not<br>
(step S40) .<br>
Further, if the stop operation is not performed is not<br>
performed (step S40; NO), the processing is returned to the<br>
step S38 to continue the reproducing processing as well as<br>
a value of the second disk type information 88 in<br>
respective DSI data 51, which are sequentially obtained in<br>
accordance with the continuation of the reproduction, is<br>
confirmed. On one hand, if the stop operation is performed<br>
(step S40; YES), the reproducing processing is stopped as<br><br>
it is (step S30) and a series of the reproducing processing •<br>
is terminated.<br>
On the other hand, under the determination of the step<br>
S85, if the second disk type information 88 is not "01b"<br>
(step S85; NO), in the present loaded optical disk, the<br>
type of the optical disk, which is indicated by the first<br>
disk type information 145, is different from the type of<br>
the optical disk, which is indicated by the second disk<br>
type information 88, so that it is assumed that this DVD is<br>
highly possibly a DVD formed by illegally copying the<br>
record information therein and the reproducing processing<br>
of this DVD is immediately stopped (step S31) as well as<br>
this optical disk is ejected from the information recording<br>
reproducing apparatus (step S32) to terminate the<br>
reproducing processing.<br>
As described above, even in the case of performing the<br>
operation of the information recording/reproducing<br>
apparatus according to the modified embodiment, it is<br>
possible to obtain the same effect as that of the<br>
information recording/reproducing apparatus S according to<br>
the above described embodiment.<br>
Alternatively, the above described embodiment and the<br>
modified embodiment are explained on the assumption that<br>
the first disk type information 145 and the second disk<br>
type information 9 and 88 have the same content each other.<br>
However, in addition to this, it is possible to constitute<br>
the embodiment and the modified embodiment in such a manner<br><br>
that the first disk type information 145 and the second<br>
disk type information 9 and 88 are set so as to have a<br>
predetermined corresponding relation, which is capable of<br>
being recognized only by the normal information<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus to record the recording<br>
information.<br>
Alternatively, the above described embodiment and the<br>
modified embodiment are explained on the assumption that<br>
the second disk type information 9 is recorded in the VMGI<br>
4 and the second disk type information 88 is recorded in<br>
the DSI data 51, respectively. However, in order to<br>
further make the interpolation difficult, for- example, it<br>
is possible to constitute the embodiment and the modified<br>
embodiment in such a manner that the present second disk<br>
type information are recorded in a portion of the copy<br>
protection information, which is set in advance.<br>
Further, although the interpolation becomes rather<br>
easy, it is also possible to constitute the embodiment and<br>
the modified embodiment in such a manner that any one of<br>
the second disk type information 9 and 88 is recorded and<br>
the class of the optical' disk which is indicated by the<br>
present one of the second,disk type information 9 and 88 is<br>
compared to the type of the optical disk which is indicated<br>
by the first type information 145 so as to control the<br>
reproducing processing.<br>
Furthermore, according to the above described<br>
embodiment, if the type of the optical disk which is<br><br>
indicated by the first disk type information 145 is<br>
different from the type of the optical disk which is<br>
indicated by the second disk type information 9 in the VMGI<br>
4 upon the loading processing, this optical disk is ejected<br>
to the outside. However, the embodiment may be constituted<br>
so as to perform this determination upon the reproducing<br>
processing.<br>
Alternatively, it is matter of course that a display<br>
panel of the information recording/reproducing apparatus<br>
and an externally connected display or the like may display<br>
the warning in spite of ejecting the optical disk in which<br>
the recording information is illegally copied to the<br>
outside.<br>
Furthermore, the invention may be applied to the<br>
illegal copy protection processing for the CD capable of<br>
recording the information or the like in addition to the<br>
above described DVD capable of recording the information.<br>
Furthermore, recording a program corresponding to a<br>
flow chart shown in FIGs. 8 to 10 and FIGs. 12 to 14 in a<br>
flexible disk or a hard disk or the like as an information<br>
recording medium and reading out it by using a personal<br>
computer or the like to be executed, it is also possible to<br>
operate the personal computer or the like as the above<br>
described system controller 125.<br>
Accordingly, by effectively prohibiting the<br>
reproduction of the recording information, which is<br>
provided with the above illegal recording processing by the<br><br>
information processing apparatus or the like, the recording<br>
medium in which the private recording information is<br>
recorded and the recording medium in which the recording<br>
information is illegally copied are differentiated and the<br>
reproduction of the recording information, which is<br>
recorded in the recording medium in which the recording<br>
information is illegally copied, is prevented, so that it<br>
is possible to effectively protect -a copy right.<br>
