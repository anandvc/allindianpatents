				<td>ELECTRODE FOR GAS EVOLUTION AND METHOD FOR ITS<br>
PRODUCTION<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a multilayer electrode for evolving gas in<br>
electrochemical processes, and to the method for the production thereof<br>
starting from a valve metal substrate. The electrode is employed in an<br>
assortment of electrochemical processes, among which copper<br>
electrometallurgy and the treatment of waste or tap water.<br>
Several types of electrodes are known in the art providing the use of<br>
substrates with a conductive and inert metallic base coated with<br>
electrocatalytic layers constituting the site of electrochemical reactions<br>
involving gas evolution. A very common case is given for instance by<br>
anodes on titanium or other valve metal matrix coated with a layer of noble<br>
metals, in their elemental state or as oxides, employed in electrolysis<br>
processes with chlorine or oxygen evolution; another common case of<br>
oxygen evolving anodes is given by the various electrometallurgic<br>
applications (electrowinning, electrorefining, fast electroplating etc.) in<br>
aqueous electrolyte. Electrodes of such kind are disclosed for example in<br>
patents US 3,428,544, US 3,711,385, and many others. In many cases,<br>
the reaction environment is particularly aggressive, for instance due to the<br>
high acidity of the electrolyte, or to the presence of corrosive species such<br>
as fluoride ions, or again for the high current density at which the process<br>
is carried out. In these cases there is the risk that corrosion or passivation<br>
of the valve metal used as substrate may occur through the porosity or the<br>
possible defects of the catalytic coating. Although some valve metals, such<br>
as tantalum, present enhanced characteristics of resistance to this kind of<br>
phenomena, the use of more vulnerable metals, such as titanium, is<br>
preferred for reasons of workability and cost. To obviate at least in part to<br>
the action of the reaction environment, it is known the possibility of<br>
interposing a thin protective interlayer between substrate and catalytic<br>
coating. The protective interlayer is often of ceramic nature, and almost<br>
always based on transition metal oxides capable of forming compact<br><br>
surfaces across a very limited thickness, as their less than excellent<br>
electric conductivity imposes not exceeding with the thickness to avoid<br>
paying excessive resistive penalties. In the case of titanium, the use of<br>
mixed valve metal oxides, for example titanium and tantalum oxide, in the<br>
formulation of a suitable interlayer, is known from EP 0545869.<br>
Although useful and sometimes necessary, the transition metal oxide-<br>
based thin interiayer may not be sufficient to impart the desired protection<br>
in the case of a few particularly critical applications. Some electrode<br>
embodiments have been therefore proposed in the course of the years,<br>
with or without a protective interiayer, provided with a dual coating,<br>
consisting of a proper catalytic layer, or activation layer, and of an external<br>
protective layer having suitable porosity, so as to allow the species<br>
involved in the electrochemical reactions to reach the catalytic sites of the<br>
underlying activation layer, without however an electrolyte renovation,<br>
effective enough to develop the corrosive action on the substrate to its<br>
maximum extent, taking place on the latter. This technique is not limited to<br>
the use in the field of anodes: US 4,300,992 discloses for instance the use<br>
of a valve metal cathode for the production of chlorates comprising a<br>
coating consisting of an intermediate activation layer based on noble<br>
metals and of an outer protective layer based on catalytically inert metal<br>
oxides; FR 2797646 presents a very similar solution, except for the fact<br>
that the protective layer comprises, besides catalytically inert metal oxides<br>
(in this case, valve metal oxides) also a certain amount of noble metal,<br>
although to a lesser extent with respect to that contained in the<br>
intermediate activation layer. The electrolytic processes for the production<br>
of chlorates are nevertheless not the only field of application wherein the<br>
corrosion phenomena are so pronounced so as to suggest the<br>
employment of outer protective layers. WO 01/00905 discloses for<br>
example the use of an outer protective layer, which for example may<br>
comprise titanium, tin or tantalum oxides, destined to anodes for copper<br>
plating, whose activation layer normally comprises iridium and/or other<br>
platinum group metals. An outer protective layer presents a further<br><br>
important benefit, besides prolonging the lifetime of the anodes for copper<br>
plating and in general of the electrodes subjected to gas evolution: just in<br>
the case of electrometallurgic processes, the electrolytic baths commonly<br>
employed provide the introduction of organic substances, used for instance<br>
as brighteners/levellers or as carriers. The carrier, which regulates the<br>
diffusion of copper ions toward the surface, forms a thin film close to the<br>
surface itself without co-depositing, thereby controlling the growth of the<br>
metal crystals. The brightener/leveller acts instead at a microscopic level,<br>
flooding the areas acquiring a temporarily high potential and that would act<br>
thereby as preferential sites of deposition, forcing the metal to deposit<br>
elsewhere. The continuous migration of this additive while the local<br>
distribution of potential changes favours therefore the uniform metal<br>
deposition. The above described organic additives tend however to be<br>
destroyed when they come in contact with the oxygen evolving catalytic<br>
sites, thus requiring a continuous restoring, entailing a non negligible cost.<br>
The outer protective layer of suitable porosity makes the transportation of<br>
additives to the anodic catalytic sites difficult, thoroughly lessening the<br>
consumption thereof. Nevertheless, it could be verified that the electrode of<br>
WO 01/00905, although acceptable in terms of electrochemical potential<br>
notwithstanding the presence of the outer protective layer that partially<br>
masks the catalytic sites, does not offer at all an adequate solution in<br>
terms of operative lifetime: the protective layer applied externally to the<br>
activation layer according to the teaching of WO 01/00905 tends to be<br>
removed after some time, probably due to the eroding action exerted by<br>
the gas evolving on the underlying catalytic layer. In a short time (two to six<br>
months, for example, in the usual operative conditions of copper plating<br>
cells), large portions of the activation layer result to be uncovered and<br>
vulnerable to the electrolyte corrosive action, moreover going back to<br>
acting as sites of destruction of the organic additives.<br>
Another example of application wherein the use of a multilayer electrode<br>
for gas evolution having an outer protective layer and an activation layer<br>
interposed between the latter and the substrate turns out to be useful is<br><br>
given by the anodes for waste water treatment. In such field, widespread is<br>
the use of ceramic anodes, for instance based on tin dioxide, optionally<br>
doped with other elements capable of imparting the required electric<br>
conductivity and of regulating the electrochemical potential thereof, which<br>
evolve oxygen at high potential in the water under treatment (until 2 V<br>
referred to the Normal Hydrogen Electrode). The species developed by the<br>
anodic reaction such as atomic oxygen and ozone achieve in this case a<br>
good destruction of organic residues, algae, bacteria and other<br>
contaminant and/or scaling biological forms. As the ceramic anodes are so<br>
expensive and, mainly, as they have mechanical characteristics which<br>
strongly limit their geometry and size, alternative electrodes have been<br>
proposed, for instance in US 5,364,509, made of a valve metal substrate<br>
coated with somewhat modified tin oxide, with an intermediate layer of<br>
higher electric conductivity and an outer protective layer also useful to<br>
regulate the working potential. The duration of this type of electrode is<br>
however extremely penalised by the scarce mutual adhesion of the<br>
different layers.<br>
According to the present invention, it is provided a method for the<br>
preparation of a multilayer electrode for gas evolution, comprising a valve<br>
metal substrate, an intermediate activation layer and an outer protection<br>
layer, overcoming the drawbacks of the prior art and presenting largely<br>
extended operating lifetimes.<br>
According to a further aspect, it is provided a method for the preparation of<br>
an anode for oxygen evolution in processes of copper or other metal<br>
plating overcoming the drawbacks of the prior art and presenting largely<br>
extended operating lifetimes and reduced consumption of organic<br>
additives.<br>
According to a further aspect, it is provided a method for the preparation of<br>
an anode for oxygen evolution in waste or tap water treatment presenting<br>
high oxygen evolution potentials at low current density for extended<br>
lifetimes.<br>
The method of the invention comprises the preparation of a first solution<br><br>
containing the precursor of one or more noble metals and/or relative<br>
oxides, the preparation of a second solution containing the precursor of at<br>
least one oxide of a non noble transition metal, the application in two or<br>
more alternate cycles of the two solutions in one or more coats per cycle,<br>
with the execution of an intermediate thermal treatment after each coat for<br>
the conversion of the relative precursors, and lastly the execution of a final<br>
thermal treatment.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the first solution contains also the precursor<br>
of at least one oxide of non noble transition metal, at a substantially lower<br>
concentration than in the second solution.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the second solution contains also the<br>
precursor of one or more noble metals and/or relative oxides, at a<br>
substantially lower concentration than in the first solution.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, both solutions comprise the precursor of<br>
at least one oxide of non noble transition metal and the precursor of one or<br>
more noble metals and/or relative oxides, and the ratio of the<br>
concentrations of the precursors is substantially different in the two<br>
solutions.<br>
The electrode of the invention is obtained starting from a valve metal<br>
substrate; for reasons of cost and workability, titanium is the preferred<br>
valve metal, but others such as tantalum, niobium or zirconium can be<br>
employed depending from the needs. A protective interlayer may be<br>
deposited in direct contact with the substrate, as known in the art. In case<br>
titanium electrodes are used in an acidic environment, for instance, the<br>
preferred interiayer is a mixture of valve metal oxides, typically titanium<br>
and tantalum, as disclosed in EP 0545869. On the substrate, provided or<br>
not with an interiayer, are then formed the activation layer and the<br>
protective layer. Instead of depositing the two complete layers one after<br>
the other, with the associated problems of mutual adhesion evidenced in<br>
the prior art, it has been surprisingly noticed that a much more controlled<br>
way of depositing two distinct layers is that of forming two solutions, one<br>
rich in noble metal, the other rich in transition metals capable of forming<br><br>
protective oxides, and to apply them in alternate cycles, each consisting of<br>
one or more coats, executing a thermal treatment after each coat which<br>
serves to convert the precursors in the two solutions to the final<br>
components.<br>
It has been surprisingly noticed that, although the two solution are applied<br>
in an alternate fashion, even in a high number of cycles, the process leads<br>
to the formation of an inner layer rich in noble metal and relatively poor in<br>
non noble transition metal, of generally constant composition; and of an<br>
outer layer progressively richer in non noble metal, wherein such structure<br>
turns out to be provided with high mechanical stability.<br>
Without wishing the present invention to be bound in any way to a<br>
particular theory, it may be presumed that the noble metal-rich solution,<br>
applied according to the method of the invention, present cracks and<br>
fractures which are filled by the second solution, mechanically reinforcing<br>
it. It may be as well presumed that diffusion/migration phenomena<br>
following the final thermal treatment contribute to form the peculiar<br>
concentration profile detectable by microanalysis. The outer protective<br>
layer results in any case extremely well anchored to the inner activation<br>
layer, as the result of a gradual change in the composition toward the<br>
surface, without steep discontinuities.<br>
In order to improve the compatibility between interlayer and activation<br>
layer, it may be convenient to insert a second protective interiayer, very<br>
rich in noble metal, between the two. For this purpose, the method of the<br>
invention provides the application to the valve metal substrate, in this<br>
sequence:<br>
-	of the thin interiayer precursor, for instance based on titanium and<br>
tantalum oxides<br>
-	of a few coats of the noble metal-rich solution<br>
-	of at least two alternate cycles of the two solutions, one rich in noble<br>
metal, the other rich in non noble transition metal capable of forming<br>
protective oxides, each cycle comprising the deposition of one or more<br>
coats of the corresponding solution.<br><br>
The application of the solution may be effected in different ways, for<br>
instance by rolling, or by spraying optionally assisted by an electrostatic<br>
field. After each coat, it is necessary to carry out a thermal treatment at a<br>
temperature comprised between 300 and 700°C to effect the conversion of<br>
the precursors in the final components.<br>
As the non noble transition metals capable of forming protective oxides,<br>
titanium and tantalum mixtures and tin are preferred; the latter is<br>
particularly preferred in the case of electrodes destined to work in plating<br>
baths containing fluorides, an impurity which is present in many metallurgic<br>
applications (galvanic chromium plating, copper and zinc primary<br>
electrometallurgy) capable of establishing serious corrosion and<br>
deactivation phenomena on the electrodes starting from contamination<br>
levels of a few parts per million. Tin is also the typical element for<br>
protection of anodes destined to work at high potential in the treatment of<br>
waste or tap water; in this case, it is typically mixed with antimony to<br>
increase its conductivity and catalytic properties. A solution of precursors<br>
of transition metals capable of forming protective oxides for anodes<br>
destined to waste water treatment contains, in one preferred embodiment,<br>
tin, antimony and optionally a conductor selected from copper and/or<br>
iridium; in this case tin typically amounts to at least 90% of the overall<br>
metal expressed as weight percentage, whilst the overall content of copper<br>
and/or iridium is comprised between 0.1 and 2%.<br>
As the noble metals, almost all the elements of the platinum group,<br>
especially iridium, platinum itself, and moreover ruthenium, palladium and<br>
rhodium are employed; a typical case of noble metal-rich solution, also<br>
containing non noble transition metal, can contain tantalum and iridium, for<br>
instance as chlorides, preferably in a Ta:lr ratio comprised between 20:80<br>
and 45:55 by weight. The typical noble metal loading in the activation layer<br>
ranges between 4 and 30 g/m2, except in the case of electrodes for waste<br>
or tap water treatment wherein the high potentials required impose a much<br>
lower noble metal content, typically comprised between 0.5 and 3 g/m2.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br><br>
A 1.5 mm thick titanium sheet grade 1 according to ASTM B 265, with a<br>
surface of 35 cm x 35 cm, was subjected to a degreasing treatment with<br>
acetone followed by corundum sandblasting, annealing at 570°C and<br>
etching in sulphuric acid. The sheet was then painted with two coats of a<br>
solution of tantalum and titanium chlorides in a 1:4 weight ratio referred to<br>
the metals, and subjected to a ten minute thermal treatment at 550°C after<br>
each coat, giving rise to an oxide film corresponding to 1 g/m2 expressed<br>
as the sum of tantalum plus titanium.<br>
4 coats were then applied of an acidic solution containing tantalum and<br>
iridium chlorides in a 35:65 weight ratio referred to the metals, so as to<br>
apply about 1 g/m2 of metal per coat. After each coat, a ten minute thermal<br>
treatment at 550°C was carried out.<br>
The same acidic solution of Ta and Ir chlorides previously applied and a<br>
second acidic solution containing 55 g/l of TiCl3 in hydrochloric acid were<br>
then applied in 6 alternate cycles of 2 coats each, with a ten minute<br>
thermal treatment at 550°C after each coat.<br>
A final thermal treatment at 550°C for two hours was carried out. The sheet<br>
was cut in half and subjected to linear scan with an EDAX probe in the<br>
direction of its thickness. The analysis evidenced the formation of an about<br>
4 micrometres thick intermediate layer of generally constant composition,<br>
with a (Ta+Ti):lr weight ratio of about 1:1, and of an outer layer about 2<br>
micrometres thick with a (Ta+Ti):lr weight ratio gradually increasing from<br>
1:1 to 3:1 proceeding towards the surface.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
A 1.5 mm thick titanium sheet grade 1 according to ASTM B 265, with a<br>
surface of 35 cm x 35 cm, was subjected to a degreasing treatment with<br>
acetone followed by corundum sandblasting, annealing at 570°C and<br>
etching in sulphuric acid. The sheet was then painted with two coats of a<br>
solution of tantalum and titanium chlorides in a 1:4 weight ratio referred to<br>
the metals, and subjected to a ten minute thermal treatment at 550°C after<br>
each coat, giving rise to an oxide film corresponding to 1 g/m2 expressed<br>
as the sum of tantalum plus titanium.<br><br>
4 coats were then applied of an acidic solution containing tantalum and<br>
iridium chlorides in a 35:65 weight ratio referred to the metals, so as to<br>
apply about 1 g/m2 of metal per coat. After each coat, a ten minute thermal<br>
treatment at 550°C was carried out.<br>
The same acidic solution of Ta and Ir chlorides previously applied and a<br>
second acidic solution containing 50 g/l of TaCI5 in hydrochloric acid were<br>
then applied in 10 alternate cycles of 2 coats each, with a ten minute<br>
thermal treatment at 550°C after each coat.<br>
A final thermal treatment at 550°C for two hours was carried out. The sheet<br>
was cut in half and subjected to linear scan with an EDAX probe in the<br>
direction of its thickness. The analysis evidenced the formation of an about<br>
6 micrometres thick intermediate layer of generally constant composition,<br>
with a Ta.lr weight ratio of about 1:1. and of an outer layer about 2<br>
micrometres thick with a Ta:lr weight ratio gradually increasing from 1:1 to<br>
2.5:1 proceeding towards the surface.<br>
COUNTEREXAMPLE 1<br>
A 1.5 mm thick titanium sheet grade 1 according to ASTM B 265, with a<br>
surface of 35 cm x 35 cm, was subjected to a degreasing treatment with<br>
acetone followed by corundum sandblasting, annealing at 570°C and<br>
etching in sulphuric acid. The sheet was then painted with two coats of a<br>
solution of tantalum and titanium chlorides in a 1:4 weight ratio referred to<br>
the metals, and subjected to a ten minute thermal treatment at 550°C after<br>
each coat, giving rise to an oxide film corresponding to 1 g/m2 expressed<br>
as the sum of tantalum plus titanium.<br>
14 coats of an acidic solution containing titanium and iridium chlorides in a<br>
35:65 weight ratio referred to the metals were then applied, so as to apply<br>
about 1 g/m2 of overall metal (iridium plus tantalum) per each coat. A ten<br>
minute thermal treatment at 550°C was carried out after each coat.<br>
4 coats of an acidic solution containing 55 g/l of TaCI5 in hydrochloric acid<br>
were finally applied, with a ten minute thermal treatment at 550°C after<br>
each coat. After these applications, the overall amount of deposited metal,<br>
expressed as the sum of tantalum plus iridium, resulted to be about 15<br><br>
g/m2.<br>
A final thermal treatment at 550°C for two hours was carried out. The sheet<br>
was cut in half and subjected to linear scan with an EDAX probe in the<br>
direction of its thickness. The analysis evidenced the formation of an about<br>
5 micrometres thick intermediate layer of variable composition, with a Ta:lr<br>
weight ratio gradually increasing from 1:2 to 2:1 proceeding towards the<br>
surface, and of an iridium-free 2 micrometres thick outer layer.<br>
COUNTEREXAMPLE 2<br>
A 1.5 mm thick titanium sheet grade 1 according to ASTM B 265, with a<br>
surface of 35 cm x 35 cm, was subjected to a degreasing treatment with<br>
acetone followed by corundum sandblasting, annealing at 570°C and<br>
etching in sulphuric acid. The sheet was then painted with two coats of a<br>
solution of tantalum and titanium chlorides in a 1:4 weight ratio referred to<br>
the metals, and subjected to a ten minute thermal treatment at 550°C after<br>
each coat, giving rise to an oxide film corresponding to 1 g/m2 expressed<br>
as the sum of tantalum plus titanium.<br>
24 coats were then applied of an acidic solution containing tantalum and<br>
iridium chlorides in a 1:1 weight ratio referred to the metals, so as to apply<br>
about 1 g/m2 of overall metal per each coat. A ten minute thermal<br>
treatment at 550°C was carried out after each coat. A final thermal<br>
treatment at 550°C for two hours was carried out. The sheet was cut in half<br>
and subjected to linear scan with an EDAX probe in the direction of its<br>
thickness. The analysis evidenced the formation of an about 6 micrometres<br>
thick intermediate layer of generally constant composition, with a Ta:lr<br>
weight ratio of about 1:1, and of an about 2 micrometres thick outer layer<br>
with a Ta:lr ratio gradually increasing from 1:1 to 2.5:1 proceeding towards<br>
the surface.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
The four samples of the previous examples and counterexamples were<br>
subjected to an accelerated life-test consisting in operating them as<br>
oxygen evolving anodes at high current density in an aggressive<br>
electrolyte, measuring the time of deactivation expressed as number of<br><br>
working hours necessary to make the electrode overvoltage rise above a<br>
predetermined value. The duration value obtained in this type of test,<br>
wherein the process conditions are extremely exasperated with respect to<br>
those of the industrial practice, allows extrapolating with some reliability<br>
the duration in the real processes they are destined to, as known to the<br>
experts of the field.<br>
The lifetime test employed consists of using the sample as oxygen<br>
evolving anode in a test cell which effects the electrolysis of a sulphuric<br>
acid aqueous solution with a concentration of 150 g/l at 60°C, at an anodic<br>
current density of 30 kA/m2. As the counterelectrode, a hydrogen evolving<br>
zirconium cathode of large surface is employed, whose potential is<br>
substantially constant in the course of the test. The initial cell voltage in<br>
these conditions is about 4.5 V; the anode is considered as deactivated<br>
when such cell voltage reaches the conventional value of 8 V.<br>
The samples of examples 1 and 2 showed a duration of 2250 and 2400<br>
hours, that of counterexample 1 a duration of 1815 hours; in the case of<br>
counterexample 2, a higher initial cell voltage was detected (4.7 V), with a<br>
duration of 990 hours.<br>
Without wishing the present invention to be bound to any particular theory,<br>
it may be presumed that the latter sample, although almost<br>
indistinguishable from that of example 2 by means of an EDAX analysis,<br>
has in fact an insufficient electronic conductivity, as it consists of a mixture<br>
of scarcely conductive tantalum oxide containing a dispersion of<br>
conductive iridium oxide; with a 1:1 by weight composition, the amount of<br>
iridium oxide particles is insufficient to grant the layer an optimal electric<br>
conduction: the iridium oxide particles are dispersed in a nearly<br>
homogeneous fashion and are therefore separated and not able to form<br>
continuous rows. Conversely, the electrodes of examples 1 and 2 likely<br>
consist of fractured but electrically continuous iridium oxide layers, whose<br>
porosity is filled with tantalum oxide performing its protective function<br>
without altering the local conduction bridges; although the EDAX has not a<br>
sufficient resolution to distinguish the two phases, they are less<br><br>
interpenetrated and the functioning of the electrode is by no means<br>
jeopardised, allowing a cell voltage equivalent to that of the electrode of<br>
counterexample 1 and not much higher than what obtainable with an<br>
electrode not provided with an outer protective layer.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
The samples of examples 1 and 2 and of counterexample 1 were<br>
subjected to a test in industrial operating conditions, in a process of copper<br>
plating. An aqueous electrolyte was used containing 140 g/l CuSO4 and<br>
200 g/l H2S04, with a total of 100 ppm of chlorides and with the addition of<br>
50 cc/l of a leveller commercialised as SBH by the Shipley Company,<br>
L.L.C., Marlborough, MA/ USA. The copper cathode was shaped as a thin<br>
sheet, and the plating process was carried out at a current density of 3<br>
kA/m2. The neutralisation of the acidity due to the anodic evolution of<br>
oxygen and the restoring of the deposited copper were effected by addition<br>
of cuprous oxide. During the first three months of operation, the electrodes<br>
of examples 1 and 2 required a reintegration of 650 cc of levellers per 100<br>
litres of solution, versus 800 cc per 100 litres of the electrode of<br>
counterexample 1. After three months, the reintegration of leveller<br>
required by the electrode of counterexample 1 increased by 100%, while<br>
that necessary with the electrodes of examples 1 and 2 remained<br>
substantially constant.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
Two 1.5 mm thick titanium sheets grade 1 according to ASTM B 265, with<br>
a surface of 35 cm x 35 cm, were subjected to a degreasing treatment with<br>
acetone followed by corundum sandblasting, annealing at 570°C and<br>
etching in sulphuric acid. Both sheets were then painted with two coats of<br>
a solution of tantalum and titanium chlorides in a 1:4 weight ratio referred<br>
to the metals, and subjected to a ten minute thermal treatment at 550°C<br>
after each coat, giving rise to an oxide film corresponding to 1 g/m2<br>
expressed as the sum of tantalum plus titanium.<br>
On the first sheet, 20 coats of an acidic solution containing tantalum and<br>
iridium chlorides in a 35:65 weight ratio referred to the metals were then<br><br>
applied, so as to deposit about 1 g/m2 of metal overall (iridium plus<br>
tantalum) per coat. A ten minute thermal treatment at 530°C was carried<br>
out after each coat, then a final thermal treatment at 550°C for two hours.<br>
On the second sheet were applied, in 10 alternate cycles of 2 coats each<br>
and with a thermal treatment at 530°C after each coat, the same acidic<br>
solution of Ta and Ir chlorides applied on the first sheet, and a second<br>
acidic solution containing 20 g/l of tin oxalate in nitric solution,<br>
corresponding to a final deposit of 14 g/m2 of metal overall. A final thermal<br>
treatment of two hours at 550°C was then carried out. The second sheet<br>
was cut in half and subjected to linear scan with an EDAX probe in the<br>
direction of its thickness. The analysis evidenced the formation of an about<br>
6 micrometres thick intermediate layer of generally constant composition,<br>
with a (Ta+Sn):lr ratio of about 1:1, and of an about 2 micrometres thick<br>
outer layer with a (Ta+lr):lr ratio gradually increasing from 1:1 to 4:1<br>
proceeding towards the surface.<br>
The two electrodes so obtained were subjected to the same life-test of<br>
example 3, the difference being that 5 ppm of fluorides were added to the<br>
sulphuric electrolyte.<br>
The electrode obtained from the first sheet, activated with tantalum and<br>
iridium, showed a duration of 275 hours; the electrode obtained from the<br>
second sheet, containing tin, evidenced a duration of 1320 hours.<br>
COUNTEREXAMPLE 3<br>
A 1.5 mm thick titanium sheet grade 1 according to ASTM B 265, with a<br>
surface of 35 cm x 35 cm, was subjected to a degreasing treatment with<br>
acetone followed by corundum sandblasting, annealing at 570°C and<br>
etching in sulphuric add. The sheet was then painted with two coats of a<br>
solution of tantalum and titanium chlorides in a 1:4 weight ratio referred to<br>
the metals, and subjected to a ten minute thermal treatment at 550°C after<br>
each coat, giving rise to an oxide film corresponding to 1 g/m2 expressed<br>
as the sum of tantalum plus titanium.<br>
10 coats were then applied on the sheet of an acidic solution containing<br>
tantalum and iridium chlorides in a 35:65 weight ratio referred to the<br><br>
metals, so as to deposit about 1 g/m2 overall of metal per each coat. A ten<br>
minute thermal treatment at 530°C was carried out after each coat.<br>
4 coats were subsequently applied, with thermal treatment at 530°C after<br>
each coat, of the same nitric solution of tin oxalate of the previous<br>
example, corresponding to a final deposit of 14 g/m2 of metal overall.<br>
A final thermal treatment at 550°C was then carried out for two hours.<br>
The sheet was cut in half and subjected to linear scan with an EDAX probe<br>
in the direction of its thickness. The analysis evidenced the formation of an<br>
about 6 micrometres thick intermediate layer of variable composition, with<br>
a Ta:lr ratio gradually increasing from 1:2 to 2:1 proceeding towards the<br>
surface, and of a 2 micrometres thick outer layer fundamentally consisting<br>
of tin dioxide.<br>
The electrode was subjected to the same test of example 5, following<br>
which a duration of 400 hours was detected.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
Two 1.5 mm thick titanium sheets grade 1 according to ASTM B 265, with<br>
a surface of 35 cm x 35 cm, were subjected to a degreasing treatment with<br>
acetone followed by corundum sandblasting, annealing at 570°C and<br>
etching in sulphuric acid. Both sheets were then painted with two coats of<br>
a solution of tantalum and titanium chlorides in a 1:4 weight ratio referred<br>
to the metals, and subjected to a ten minute thermal treatment at 550°C<br>
after each coat, giving rise to an oxide film corresponding to 1 g/m2<br>
expressed as the sum of tantalum plus titanium.<br>
On the first sheet were then applied, in 10 alternate cycles of 2 coats each<br>
and with a thermal treatment at 530°C after each coat, a very dilute acidic<br>
solution containing tantalum and iridium chlorides in a 35:65 weight ratio<br>
referred to the metals, so as to deposit about 0.1 g/m2 of metal per each<br>
coat, and a second acidic solution containing 22 g/l overall of tin oxalate,<br>
antimony chloride and iridium (IV) chloride in nitric solution, in a weight<br>
ratio of Sn 93.5%, Sb4.5%, Ir 2%.<br>
The second sheet was painted likewise, except that the second acidic<br>
solution contained tin oxalate, antimony chloride and cupric nitrate<br><br>
hexahydrate in nitric solution, in a weight ratio of Sn 93.5%, Sb 4.5%, Cu<br>
2%. A final thermal treatment for two hours at 550°C was then carried out.<br>
The sheets were cut in half and subjected to linear scan with an EDAX<br>
probe in the direction of their thickness. The analysis evidenced: in the<br>
former case, the formation of an about 5 micrometres thick intermediate<br>
layer of generally constant composition, with an iridium content of 2%<br>
expressed as weight percentage, and of an about 3 micrometres thick<br>
outer layer with progressively decreasing iridium content up to a 0.5%<br>
value in correspondence of the surface; in the latter case, an equivalent<br>
situation, but with an iridium content in the outer layer decreased at trace<br>
level in correspondence of the surface.<br>
The two sheets were characterised as electrodes for the potabilisation of<br>
tap water at ambient temperature, against a zirconium cathode. The<br>
anodic potential, measured in 0.1 N sulphuric acid at ambient temperature<br>
at a current density of 100 A/m2, resulted to be 1.85 V for the electrode<br>
obtained from the former sheet, 2.10 V for the electrode obtained from the<br>
latter<br>
Although those which are believed to be the best embodiments of the<br>
present invention have been described, it will be evident to the experts in<br>
the art that other variations and modifications may be introduced thereto<br>
without departing from the spirit and scope of the same.<br><br><br>
