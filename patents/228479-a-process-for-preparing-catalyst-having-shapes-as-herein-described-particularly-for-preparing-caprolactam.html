				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>as herein described particularly<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing catalyst   having  shapesi<br>
for preparing caprolactatn comprising shaping a catalytically active oxide which has no soluble constituents under the conditions for preparing cyclic lactams by the reaction of aminocarbonitriles with water.<br>
OZ.0050/44458 discloses the use of shaped articles having no soluble consitutents under the reaction conditions as a catalyst for preparing cyclic lactams by reacting aminocarbonitriles with water in the liquid phase in a fixed bed reactor. The catalysts, which can comprise a multiplicity of oxides, selenides, tellurides and phosphates, are obtainable, for example, by extruding powders of the corresponding compounds.<br>
It is true that the shaped articles afford cyclic lactams, but selectivity and yield are not fully satisfactory, especially at short residence times which make a high space-time yield possible and so make it possible to make the reactors smaller.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a method of using shaped articles having no soluble constituents under the reaction conditions as a catalyst for preparing cyclic lactams by reacting aminocarbonitriles with water in the liquid phase in a fixed bed reactor without the above-described disadvantages.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved according to the present invention by a method of using shaped articles essentially comprising a catalytically active oxide as a catalyst which has no soluble constituents under the reaction conditions for preparing cyclic lactams by reacting aminocarbonitriles with water in the liquid phase in a fixed bed reactor, said catalyst consisting of shaped articles obtainable by shaping the oxide into shaped articles and, before or after said shaping, treating the oxide with from 0.1 to 30% by weight, based on the oxide, of an acid in which the oxide is sparingly soluble.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the method of use of the present invention are revealed in the subclaims.<br>
The starting materials used in the process of the present invention are aminocarbonitriles, preferably those of the general formula I<br><br><br>
where n and m are each 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9 and n + m totals at least 3, preferably at least 4.<br>
R1 and R2 can in principle be substituents of any type. It is merely necessary to ensure that the desired cyclization reaction is not affected by the substituents. Preferably, R1 and R2 are independently Ci-C6-alkyl or C5-C7-cycloalkyl or C6-Ci2-aryl.<br>
Particularly preferred starting compounds are aminocarbonitriles of the general formula<br>
H2N— (CH2)m—C=N<br>
where m is 3, 4, 5 or 6, especially 5. When m = 5, the starting compound is 6-aminocapronitrile.<br>
In the process of the present invention, the above-described aminocarbonitriles are reacted with water in the liquid phase using heterogeneous catalysts to form cyclic lactams. Use of aminocarbonitriles of the formula I results in the corresponding cyclic lactams of the formula II<br><br>
where n, m, R1 and R2 are each as defined above. Particularly preferred lactams are those where n is 0 and m is 4, 5 or 6, especially 5 (caprolactam being obtained in the latter case).<br>
The reaction is carried out in the liquid phase at generally from 140 to 320°C, preferably at from 160 to 280°C; the pressure is generally within the range from 1 to 250 bar, preferably from 5 to 150 bar, it being necessary to ensure that the reaction<br><br>
mixture is predominantly liquid under the conditions employed. The residence times are generally within the range from 1 to 120, preferably 1 to 90, and especially 1 to 60, min. In some cases, residence times of from 1 to 10 min have proven to be completely adequate.<br>
The amount of water used per mole of aminocarbonitrile is generally at least 0.01 mol, preferably within the range from 0.1 to 20 mol, especially within the range from 1 to 5 mol.<br>
The aminocarbonitrile is advantageously used in the form of a from 1 to 50% strength by weight, especially from 5 to 50% strength by weight, particularly preferably from 5 to 30% strength by weight, solution in water (in which case the solvent is also reactant) or in water/solvent mixtures. Examples of usable solvents are alkanols such as methanol, ethanol, n- and i-propanol, n-, i- and t-butanol and polyols such as diethylene glycol and tetraethylene glycol, hydrocarbons such as petroleum 5ther, benzene, toluene, xylene, lactams such as pyrrolidone or caprolactam, or alkyl-substituted lactams such as N-methyl-pyrrolidone, N-methylcaprolactam or N-ethylcaprolactam, and also carboxylic esters, preferably of carboxylic acids having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms. Ammonia can also be present in the reaction. Mixtures of organic solvents can also be used. Mixtures of water and alkanols in a water/alkanol weight ratio of 1-75/25-99, preferably 1-50/50-99, have been found to be particularly advantageous in some cases.<br>
It is in principle equally possible to use the aminocarbonitriles as solvent as well as reactant.<br>
The catalytically active oxides used can be, for example, acidic, amphoteric or basic oxides, preferably aluminum oxide, such as alpha- or gamma-alumina, tin oxide, zinc oxide, cerium oxide, especially titanium dioxide, amorphous, as anatase or rutile, and also their mixtures and mixed phases.<br>
The aforementioned compounds can be doped with, or comprise, compounds of main groups 1 to 7, especially 2, 3 or 4, of the periodic table, of transition groups 1 to 7 of the periodic table, of the elements of the iron group or of the lanthanides or actinides and also mixtures thereof.<br>
If desired, these catalysts may comprise up to 50% by weight in each case of copper, tin, zinc, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, ruthenium, palladium, platinum, silver or rhodium.<br><br>
hese catalytically active oxides are preparable in a onventional manner, for example by hydrolysis of the orresponding organics, alkoxides, salts with organic or norganic acids and subsequent heating or calcining and also dvantageously, especially in the case of titanium dioxide, ►yrogenically and are generally commercially available.<br>
iccording to the invention, the oxides are treated with an acid &gt;efore or after shaping. Suitable acids include organic acids such as acetic acid, oxalic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, ftaleic acid or inorganic acids such as isopolyacids, leteropolyacids, sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid* Particularly suitable catalysts are obtainable by treatment with acetic acid, formic acid, nitric acid, especially phosphoric acid or polyphosphoric acid.<br>
It is also possible to use mixtures of acids.<br>
The treatment can be carried out continuously or batchwise in one or more stages. The individual stages can be carried out with the same acid, different acids or identical or different mixtures of acids.<br>
Similarly, the oxides can be treated with an acid in the form mentioned before and after shaping.<br>
Preferably, the oxides are treated with an acid before shaping.<br>
The amount of acid used according to the invention is from 0.1 to 30%, preferably from 0.1 to 10%, especially from 0.1 to 5%, by weight, reckoned as pure acid, based on pyrogenic titanium dioxide. The acid can be mixed with a liquid diluent, such as water.<br>
The catalysts can be prepared from the oxides without additives. It is similarly possible to add additives such as binders, for example titanium dioxide sols, salts of the oxides used, soluble titanium salt compounds, hydrolyzable titanium compounds such as titanium alkoxides or aluminum salts, such as pore-formers, for ) example methylcellulose, carbon fibers, fibers of organic polymers, melamine, starch powder, preferably before shaping.<br>
The shaped articles can be present in various forms, for example as ball, tablet, cylinder, hollow cylinder, pellet, granule or 5 strand. Such shaped articles are preparable in a conventional manner using appropriate shaping machines such as tableting<br><br>
machines, extruders, rotary granulators, pelletizers or combinations thereof.<br>
The shaped material, if desired after an acid treatment, is advantageously dried, especially at from 20 to 120°C, preferably in an inert gas atmosphere or in the air, and then calcined, especially at 400-750°C, preferably in an inert gas atmosphere or in the air.<br>
The heterogeneous catalysts are arranged in a fixed bed. The reaction can take place in a conventional manner, for example in a downflow or preferably upflow mode, especially continuously, by bringing the reaction mixture into contact with the catalyst bed.<br>
The advantage of the process of the present invention is the possibility to operate the cyclization continuously in a simple manner with very high throughputs and high yields and selectivities and short residence times. Since the catalysts used have a long lifetime from observations to date, the result is an extremely low catalyst consumption.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for preparing catalyst having shapes as herein described particularly for preparing caprolactam comprising shaping a catalytically active oxide which has no soluble constituents under the conditions for preparing cyclic lactams by the reaction of aminocarbonitriles with water in the liquid phase in a fixed bed reactor, into shaped articles by known methods, wherein said oxide is treated with from 0.1 to 30% by weight based on said oxide of an acid in which said oxide is sparingly soluble, said treatment being effected either before or after shaping.<br><br>
