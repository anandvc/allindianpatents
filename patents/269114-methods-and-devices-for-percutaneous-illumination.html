				<td>METHODS AND DEVICES FOR PERCUTANEOUS ILLUMINATION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates broadly to devices and methods for illuminating an<br>
internal region of a patient.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Endoscopic and laparoseopie surgical instruments arc often preferred over traditional<br>
open surgical devices since the use of natural orifices (endoscopic) or smaller incisions<br>
(laparoseopie) tends to reduce the post-operative recovery time and complications.<br>
Consequently, a range of endoscopic and laparoseopie surgical instruments that are suitable<br>
for precise placement of a distal end effector at a desired surgical site have been developed.<br>
These distal end effectors engage the tissue in a number of ways to achieve a diagnostic or<br>
therapeutic effect (e.g., grasper, cutter, staplers, clip applier, access device, drug/gene therapy<br>
delivery device, and energy device using ultrasound. RE, laser, etc.).<br>
[0003] Proper operation of endoscopic and laparoseopie surgical instruments is facilitated by<br>
adequate illumination ofa body cavity into which such instruments are inserted. Current<br>
endoscopes and laparoseopes arc not always capable of providing optimal lighting. For<br>
example, when an endoscope is inserted into a patient's stomach, the illumination provided<br>
by the scope can present shadows in the far-Held that can be aggravated by the rough and<br>
wavy features ol the gastric surface. Such shadowed areas can be difficult to eliminate due to<br>
the confining configuration that a scope operates w ithin. Furthermore, endoscopes and<br>
laparoseopes do not always provide sufficient illumination, and the size of such scopes may<br>
limit the ability to provide additional lighting.<br>
[0004] Accordingly, a need exists for devices and methods for improving illumination during<br>
endoscopic and iaparoscopic procedures. Such devices and methods can also potentially<br>
provide improved illumination for other types of surgical procedures.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005] The present invention generally provides percutaneous illumination devices and<br>
methods for illuminating a body cavity. In one embodiment, an illumination device is<br>
provided and can direct light from one or more illumination sources, such as a light emitting<br><br>
Attorney Docket No.: 100873-81 (END5759)<br>
diode disposed on the terminal end of the elongate member, configured to illuminate an area<br>
around an elongate member. The illumination device can include one or more optical libers<br>
coupled to the elongate member for delivering light from the illumination source to an area<br>
surrounding the elongate member. An energy source, optionally coupled to the elongate<br>
member, can be in electrical communication with each illumination source. Two support<br>
members can also be disposed on the elongate member and adapted to be positioned on<br>
opposite sides of a tissue surface to stabilize the elongate member. The support members can<br>
be spaced apart by a distance that accommodates tissue being disposed therebetween. In<br>
certain exemplary embodiments, the support members can be in the form of flanges formed<br>
around the elongate member, or they can be in the form of an expandable structure that can<br>
have a dual configuration: one for insertion into tissue and one for engaging tissue. The<br>
elongate member can also include an adjustable joint, such as a ball and socket joint, which<br>
can be adapted to allow a distal portion of the elongate member to be positioned at an angle<br>
relative to a proximal portion ol the elongate member. In oilier embodiments, the elongate<br>
member can include a penetrating tip configured to penetrate through tissue, and/or an<br>
attachment structure for receiving a suture.<br>
[0006] Another embodiment is directed toward a kit for illuminating an internal region of a<br>
patient's body. The kit can include a set of illuminating devices. Each device can include an<br>
elongate body adapted to be inserted through tissue, and at least one illumination source for<br>
illuminating a region around the device. At least one of the devices can include an adjustable<br>
joint for positioning a distal portion of the device at an angle relative to a proximal portion of<br>
the device. A set of support devices can also be included, with each support device being<br>
adapted to stabilize an illuminating device at a desired angular orientation relative to the<br>
tissue. The kit can also include a set of energy sources configured to be electrically coupled<br>
to the illumination source of at least one of the illuminating devices.<br>
[0007] In another exemplary embodiment, a method of illuminating a body cavity is<br>
provided and includes inserting an illumination device into tissue such that one end of the<br>
device is positioned within a body cavity (e.g., a stomach). Another end of the device can be<br>
positioned on an opposite side of a tissue layer relative to the end positioned within the body<br>
cavity. Insertion can be performed, for example, by delivering the illumination device using<br>
an endoscopic or laparoscopic technique, followed by penetrating the device through a body<br>
cavity wall. Alternatively, the insertion can be performed by penetrating the illumination<br>
- 2 -<br><br>
Attorney Docket No.: 100873-81 (END5759)<br>
device through dermal tissue before penetrating the body cavity wall. Insertion of the<br>
illumination device can also include coupling the device to a needle, and inserting the needle<br>
through tissue to thereby insert the illumination device. One or more tissuc-engaging<br>
members, such as flanges, can be positioned adjacent to the tissue to anchor the device<br>
relative to the tissue. The device can then be activated to illuminate the body cavity. In<br>
addition, the direction of illumination of the device can be adjusted. In an exemplary<br>
embodiment, a plurality of illumination devices can be inserted to provide a desired amount<br>
of illumination in the body cavity.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0015] Certain exemplary embodiments will now be described to provide an overall<br>
understanding of the principles, structure, function, manufacture, and use of the devices and<br>
methods disclosed herein. One or more examples of these embodiments arc illustrated in the<br>
-3 -<br><br>
Attorney Docket No.: 100873-81 (END5759)<br>
accompanying drawings. Those skilled in the art will understand that the devices and<br>
methods specifically described herein and illustrated in the accompanying drawings arc non-<br>
limiting exemplary embodiments and that the scope of the present invention is defined solely<br>
by the claims. The features illustrated or described in connection with one exemplary<br>
embodiment may be combined with features of other embodiments. Such modifications and<br>
variations arc intended to be included within the scope of the present invention.<br>
[0016] The present invention provides methods and devices for illuminating a body cavity,<br>
preferably during laparoscopic and endoscopic procedures. In particular, one or more<br>
illumination devices can be percutaneously inserted through tissue to direct light from one or<br>
more illumination sources within a body cavity. The illumination source(s) arc effective to<br>
illuminate the body cavity, thereby allowing other procedures to be performed within the<br>
body cavity. While any body cavity can be illuminated, in an exemplary embodiment the<br>
body cavity is the stomach. The illumination dcvice(s) can be positioned through the<br>
abdominal and stomach walls to illuminate the stomach, thereby allowing other procedures,<br>
such as gastric bypass and restriction procedures, to be laparoscopically or endoscopically<br>
performed within the stomach under illumination.<br>
[0017] FIG. 1A illustrates one exemplary embodiment of a percutaneous illumination device<br>
100 that can be used to illuminate a body cavity. The device 100 generally includes an<br>
elongate member 120 configured to direct light from an illumination source 1 10 to a region<br>
surrounding the elongate member 120. One or more support members can be coupled to the<br>
elongate member 120 to stabilize the illumination device 100. The embodiment depicted in<br>
FIG. 1A illustrates two support members 130, 140 adapted to be positioned on opposite sides<br>
of a tissue surface to stabilize the device 100 relative to the tissue. The device can also<br>
include other features such as leads 150, 155 for delivering energy to the illumination source<br>
110, one or more suture-retaining members for mating a suture to the devices and other<br>
features to facilitate use of the device.<br>
[0018] The elongate member 120 of The device 100 can have a variety of configurations, and<br>
it can be a rigid or flexible, substantially solid or hollow body. In an exemplary embodiment,<br>
the elongate member 120 is hollow to allow the leads 150, 155 to extend therethrough. The<br>
elongate member 120 can also includes a tissue-penetrating tip formed on one end thereof for<br>
facilitating insertion through tissue. Alternatively, the elongate member 120 can include a<br>
suture-receiving element formed thereof to allow the elongate member 120 to be coupled to a<br>
-A -<br><br>
Attorney Docket No.: 100873-81 (END5759)<br><br>
suture and pulled through tissue using the a needle and the suture. FIG. 2 illustrates one<br>
exemplary embodiment of a percutaneous illumination device 200 having an elongate<br>
member 215 with a suture-receiving element 270 formed thereon. The suture-receiving<br>
element can be in the form of a bore or hole formed at any location along the elongate<br>
member. As shown in FIG. 2. the suture-receiving clement 270 is in the form of an eyelet<br>
that is coupled to the elongate member 200 adjacent to an illumination source 210 on the<br>
terminal end of the elongate member 215.<br>
[0019] Turning back to FIG. 1 A, the elongate member 120 also preferably has a diameter<br>
that is sized to allow the device to be introduced percutancously, and has a length that is<br>
configured to allow the illumination source 110 on the distal end 120b of the elongate<br>
member 120 to be positioned within a body cavity while the proximal end 120a remains<br>
outside of the body cavity. While the particular dimensions can vary depending on the<br>
intended use. in one exemplary embodiment the elongate member has a diameter in the range<br>
of about 1 millimeters to about 5 millimeters, and a length in the range of about 25<br>
millimeters to about 300 millimeters.<br>
[0020] The illumination source associated with the device can also have a variety of<br>
configurations, and it can be coupled to. disposed within, or formed on the elongate member<br>
120 at various locations. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1 A. the illumination source 110<br>
is fixedly coupled to the distal-most end 120b of the elongate member 110, and it is in the<br>
form of a light emitting diode 110. Other potential illumination sources can also be utilized<br>
such as a xenon bulb. In such an instance, the bulb 111 can remotely create light that is piped<br>
via a liber optic 161 to the elongate member 121 and suitably directed, as shown in FIG. 1B.<br>
Though the illumination source 110 for the device 100 shown in FIG. 1A is positioned at a<br>
terminal end of the elongate member 120. the illumination source can be coupled to the<br>
elongate member at a variety of other locations. For example, the illumination source can be<br>
located at some position between the proximal and distal ends 120a. 120b of the elongate<br>
member 120 to allow a tip of the elongate member to be shaped and/or constructed to<br>
penetrate tissue. Alternatively, one end of the elongate member 120 can be configured with<br>
the penetrating tip. while the opposite end has the illumination source attached thereto. In<br>
use, energy can be provided to the illumination source using a variety of techniques. As<br>
depicted in FIG. 1A, first and second leads 150, 155 extend through the elongate member 120<br>
and serve as an electrical connection between the illumination source 110 and an external<br>
-5 -<br><br>
Attorney Docket No.: 100873-81 (END5759)<br>
power source. Alternatively, a small energy unit (e.g.. a battery) can be coupled to the<br>
lighting device to provide power, thereby creating a "self-powered" lighting device. Those<br>
skilled in the art will appreciate that a variety of other known power sources can be coupled<br>
to the percutaneous lighting device.<br>
[0021] As previously explained, the elongate member 120 can also include one or more<br>
support members configured to stabilize the illumination device relative to tissue. As<br>
depicted in FIG. 1 A. the support members 130. 140 arc in the form of flanges that are<br>
disposed around the elongate member 120, and that are spaced a distance apart from one<br>
another for engaging tissue therebetween. One of the flanges, e.g., the proximal flange 140.<br>
is preferably rigid, while the other flange 130 can be configured as an expandable structure.<br>
For example, if the expandable structure is embodied as an inflatable flange 130, the flange<br>
130 can be configured to be deflated, wholly or partially, when the illumination device 100 is<br>
being inserted through tissue. After the illumination device 100 is positioned through the<br>
tissue, the inflatable flange 130 can be expanded such that the structure can engage tissue, to<br>
limit movement of the illumination device 100. In another instance, one or both flanges 130,<br>
140 can be removable to allow the llange 130. 140 to be placed onto the elongate member<br>
120 after positioning the member 120 through desired tissue. For example, FIG. 2 illustrates<br>
another embodiment of a percutaneous illumination device 200 having a removable support<br>
member of flange 240. As shown, the elongate member 215 of the illumination device 200 is<br>
positioned through abdominal and stomach tissue 230. 220 such that the illumination source<br>
210 is disposed within a bod) cavity 280 while the opposite end 205 of the elongate member<br>
215 remains outside of the body cavity, labeled as region 290. The removable flange 240 can<br>
then be fitted around the elongate member 215 to engage abdominal tissue 230 and secure the<br>
device 200. Though various depictions and descriptions of support members herein are<br>
embodied as flanges, many other types of structures can serve as support members, so long as<br>
they are compatible for engaging tissue and securing the illumination device in a desired<br>
orientation. Accordingly, non-limiting examples of support members can include clamps,<br>
annular rings with protruding spoked structures for engaging tissue, and other structures<br>
capable of engaging tissue and a portion of the illumination device to aid in orienting the<br>
device in a desired position.<br>
[0022] In general, the use of support members, along with other portions of the illumination<br>
device (e.g., the elongate member), allow positioning of the illumination source in a desired<br>
-6 -<br><br>
Attorney Docket No.: 100873-81 (EM D5759)<br>
direction to direct illumination. The support members 130. 140, 230, 240 can be spaced<br>
along the elongate member 120, 215, as shown in FIGS. 1A and 2, to sandwich tissue with<br>
enough compression to secure a direction of the illumination source 110, 210, while not being<br>
so compressive as to prevent the illumination source 110, 210 from being pointed in different<br>
directions. This can be achieved by spacing the support members 130. 140. 230, 240 apart by<br>
a distance a bit larger than the thickness of the tissue layer(s) to allow some small amount of<br>
angular displacement of the elongate member 120, 215. Alternatively, or in addition, an<br>
adjustable joint can be coupled to the illumination device to help enhance angular positioning<br>
of the illumination source. For the specific device depicted in FIG. 2. a ball-and-socket joint<br>
260 is formed between the elongate member 215 and the support member 240 to provide an<br>
adjustable joint for directing the illumination source 2 10 in a desired angular direction. In<br>
particular, a ball is coupled on the proximal portion of the elongate member 215, and a socket<br>
is formed within the flange 240 for movably engaging the ball. The joint's friction can be<br>
configured to provide a desired trade-off between adjustability of the joint, and its ability to<br>
retain a particular angular configuration. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that many<br>
other types of adjustable joints can be utilized within the scope of the present application.<br>
[0023] In use. percutaneous illumination devices, such as the exemplary ones depicted and<br>
described with regard to FIGS. 1A and 2. can be used to provide illumination to a body<br>
cavity. FIGS 3A-3C provide various perspective views, at different magnifications, depicting<br>
the percutaneous illumination device 100 of FIG. 1A implanted to illuminate a stomach<br>
cavity 340. As depicted in FIGS. 3A-3C. the elongate structure 120 of the illumination<br>
device 100 pierces the gastric tissue 320 and the abdominal wall 330, with the end 105<br>
remaining outside the body cavity. The opposite end. having the illuminating source 110, is<br>
within the stomach cavity 340. The support members 130. 140 can be spaced apart such as to<br>
sandwich one or more tissue layers therebetween. For example, as depicted in FIG. 3C, one<br>
support member 140 can be disposed on one side of the abdominal and gastric walls 320, 330<br>
and the other support member 130 can be disposed on the opposite side of the abdominal and<br>
gastric walls 320. 330. The elongate member 120 can be positioned such that the<br>
illumination source 1 10 is directed in a desired direction, with the support members 130. 140<br>
acting to substantially fix the elongate member 120 in the desired orientation. Upon fixing<br>
and activating the illumination source, the device can provide directed illumination anywhere<br>
within a body cavity independent of other devices, such as an endoscope or laparoscope.<br>
Though FIGS. 3A-3C depict the use of only one illumination device, any number of the<br>
-7 -<br><br>
Attorney Docket No.: 100873-81 (ENd5759)<br>
devices can be positioned as desired throughout the body cavity and they can be directed to<br>
provide illumination to the areas sought to be viewed by a surgeon or other user. As well,<br>
while FIGS. 3A-3C show the use of the device for illuminating a stomach cavity, the<br>
percutaneous lighting device can also be used to illuminate other internal areas of a body<br>
(e.g., intestinal tract or portions of a chest cavity, etc.).<br>
[0024] While various techniques can be used to insert the device through tissue, in one<br>
exemplary embodiment, the illumination device can be delivered cndoscopically by a trans-<br>
oral route to a stomach cavity. For example, a sutured, or otherwise appropriately threaded,<br>
needle can be led through a working channel of an endoscope. The free end of the suture can<br>
be coupled to the illumination device. The stomach can be inflated, using a gas, such that the<br>
gastric wall 320 is brought into proximity with the abdominal wall 330 as shown in FIG. 3B.<br>
The threaded needle can then be inserted into the gastric wall, through the abdominal wall<br>
and dermal tissue to the exterior of the body. The needle and threading can be subsequently<br>
pulled to pull the device through the endoscope and eventually through the tissue layers until<br>
one end of the elongate member is positioned on the external side of the dermal tissue. When<br>
a separate power source is utilized with the illuminating source, an electrical lead can be<br>
connected to the externally placed end of the elongate member to provide power. The trailing<br>
support member can engage the stomach wall to prevent the device from being pulled<br>
completely through the tissue layers, for example, for the embodiment shown in FIG. 1A,<br>
the support member 130 can be inflated to engage the gastric wall within the stomach cavity,<br>
and support member 140 can be placed on the exposed end of the elongate member after it is<br>
pulled through the tissue to engage the tissue surfaces between the support members 130,<br>
140. For the embodiment shown in FIG. 2, support member 230 can engage the stomach<br>
wall, and the detachable llange 240 or other support member can be mated to the elongate<br>
member after it is pulled through the tissue to engage the tissues between the support<br>
members 230, 240. The elongate member can optionally be directed at a particular angle to<br>
provide a desired direction of illumination upon activating the illuminating source. This<br>
process can provide targeted illumination within a body cavity since penetrating from an<br>
inner cavity to the exterior allows for precise positioning of the illumination source. The<br>
steps of the process can be repeated multiple times for each illuminating device that is desired<br>
to be implanted.<br>

Attorney Docket No.: 100873-81 (END5759)<br>
[0025] The above exemplary embodiment is one example of how a percutaneous<br>
illuminating device can be utilized to provide illumination within a body. Those skilled in<br>
the art will appreciate that variations on these steps can be performed. For example, one<br>
alternative method of utilizing a percutaneous lighting device is to mount the device by<br>
penetrating tissue from an exterior body surface to within the body cavity or internal region<br>
to be illuminated. The stomach can be inflated, as described before, and a needle, threaded<br>
and coupled to the illumination device, can be inserted through the dermal tissue and into a<br>
body cavity. An endoscopic or laparoscopic instrument can be used to grasp the needle and<br>
pull the tethered illumination device into place such that the illumination source can properly<br>
illuminate a desired cavity location after fixation by one or more support members.<br>
Alternatively, where the elongate member includes a tissue-penetrating tip. it can be directly<br>
penetrated through tissue either from a location within the body or from an external location,<br>
without the use of a needle and suture. In such a case, the elongate member preferably<br>
includes an expandable (e.g.. inflatable) support member that can be expanded after the<br>
elongate member is penetrated through tissue to engage the tissue of the body cavity. Other<br>
variations include the use of different types of support members, utilizing the devices in other<br>
than endoscopic or laparoscopic procedures, and providing illumination in other body cavities<br>
and internal regions beyond the stomach. These variations and others are all contemplated<br>
within the scope of the present application.<br>
[0026] Since one or more percutaneous illumination devices can be used to provide adequate<br>
illumination of a body cavity, another exemplary embodiment is directed to a kit for<br>
illuminating an internal region of a body of a patient. The kit includes a set of illuminating<br>
devices. As used herein, the term "set" refers to a group having one or more members. The<br>
illuminating devices can each be embodied as any of the devices described within the present<br>
application, with any number and combination of the features described for any particular<br>
embodiment. In one example, each of the illumination devices includes an elongate body that<br>
is adapted to be inserted into tissue, and at least one illumination source for illuminating a<br>
region around the device. The kit can also include a set of support devices, such as flanges,<br>
that arc each adapted to be coupled to an illuminating device to provide stabilization at a<br>
desired angular orientation. The illumination devices can include additional features such as<br>
an adjustable joint as previously described, or the kit can include one of more additional sets<br>
of items such as a set of energy sources to be electrically coupled to the illumination sources.<br>

Attorney Docket No.: 100873-81 (END5759)<br>
Kits consistent with the exemplary embodiment can provide an appropriate and convenient<br>
grouping of percutaneous illumination devices to be used in a particular surgical procedure.<br>
[0027] Percutaneous illumination devices, including portions thereof, can be designed to be<br>
disposed of after a single use. or they can be designed to be used multiple times. In either<br>
case, however, the device can be reconditioned for reuse after at least one use.<br>
Reconditioning can include any combination of the steps of disassembly of the device,<br>
followed by cleaning or replacement of particular pieces, and subsequent reassembly. By<br>
way of example, the percutaneous illumination devices shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 can be<br>
reconditioned after the device has been used in a medical procedure. The device can be<br>
disassembled, and any number of the particular pieces (e.g.. the illumination source 110. the<br>
elongate body 120. any of the support members 130. 140, the electrical leads 150, 155. etc.)<br>
can be selectively replaced or removed in any combination. For instance, the illumination<br>
source can be replaced by a new illumination source, while the remaining pieces arc sterilized<br>
for reuse. Replacement of pieces can also include replacement of portions of particular<br>
elements, such as the replacement of a ball on an elongate member as a part of a ball-and-<br>
socket joint, Upon cleaning and/or replacement of particular parts, the device can be<br>
reassembled for subsequent use either at a reconditioning facility, or by a surgical team<br>
immediately prior to a surgical procedure. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that<br>
reconditioning of a fastener-extracting device can utilize a variety of techniques for<br>
disassembly, cleaning/replacement, and reassembly. Use of such techniques, and the<br>
resulting reconditioned percutaneous illumination device, are all within the scope of the<br>
present application.<br>
[0028] Persons skilled in the art will understand that the devices and methods specifically<br>
described herein and illustrated in the accompanying drawings are non-limiting exemplary<br>
embodiments. The features illustrated or described in connection with one exemplary<br>
embodiment may be combined with the features of other embodiments. Such modifications<br>
and variations are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention. As well,<br>
one skilled in the art will appreciate further features and advantages of the invention based on<br>
the above-described embodiments. Accordingly, the invention is not to be limited by what<br>
has been particularly shown and described, except as indicated by the appended claims.<br>
