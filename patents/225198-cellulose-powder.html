				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
CELLULOSE POWDER<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a cellulose<br>
powder, a method for preparing the cellulose powder,<br>
and a molded article composition containing the<br>
cellulose powder and one or more active ingredients.<br>
The composition is useful as an excipient for the<br>
molded article containing the active ingredient, which<br>
is used in the field of medicine, food, or other<br>
chemical industries, and particularly as an excipient<br>
for medicine tablets.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
It has been previously and widely carried out<br>
to prepare molded articles containing active<br>
ingredients by using cellulose powder as an excipient.<br>
Cellulose powders that were used are known to<br>
be microcrystalline celluloses and powdered celluloses,<br>
including the following examples.<br>
[0003]<br>
JP-B-40-26274 describes a cellulose powder<br>
having an average polymerization degree of 150 to 375,<br>
an apparent specific volume of 1.84 to 8.92 cm3/g, and a<br>
particle size of 300 µm or less.<br>
JP-B-56-2047 describes a cellulose powder<br>
having an average polymerization degree of 63 to 375<br>
and an apparent specific volume of 1.6 to 3.1 cm3/g and<br>
2 to 80 wt% of a component of 200 meshes or more, and<br>
JP-A-06-316535 deals with cellulose powder having an<br>
average polymerization degree of 100 to 375, an<br>
apparent specific volume of 4.0 to 6.0 cm3/g, and an<br>
average particle size of 30 to 120 µm without the<br>
substantial presence of a particle of 355 µm or more<br>
which is obtained by the acid hydrolysis or alkaline<br>
oxidative decomposition of a cellulosic material.<br>
[0004]<br>
WO02/02643 describes a cellulose powder<br>
having an average polymerization degree of 150 to 450,<br>
an average particle size of 20 to 250 µm, and an<br>
apparent specific volume of 4.0 to 7.0 cm3/g.<br>
JP-A-11-152233 describes those cellulose<br>
powders having an average polymerization degree of 100<br>
to 375 which pass through a sieve with a mesh size of<br>
75 (im and of which 70% or more of the total weight<br>
remains on a sieve with a mesh size of 38 µm without<br>
passing therethrough.<br>
JP-A-50-19917 describes a method for<br>
preparing an additive for tablet molding which includes<br>
pretreating purified pulp to depolymerize until the<br>
pulp has an average polymerization degree of 450 to<br>
650, and then subjecting it to mechanical pulverization<br>
treatment such that 50% or more of the resulting<br>
particles may pass through a 200-mesh sieve.<br>
JP-A-63-267731 describes a cellulose powder<br>
which is pulverized to an average particle size of 30<br>
µm or less. JP-A-63-267731 describes a method of<br>
preparation of a cellulose powder having an average<br>
particle size of 10 µm or less. This reference<br>
describes a powder having a relatively large apparent<br>
specific volume.<br>
[0005]<br>
However, there has been a problem that the<br>
cellulose powder obtained by the method disclosed in<br>
the above described reference has insufficient<br>
compression moldability because the compression<br>
moldability of it is low, and thus a tablet with<br>
practical hardness can not be obtained. Further, there<br>
has also been a problem that when an active ingredient<br>
has liquid or semisolid form, exudation of the<br>
ingredient and tableting disorder occur at the<br>
compression molding of the tablet.<br>
In addition, when a liquid or semisclid<br>
active ingredient is formed into a tablet at ordinary<br>
temperature, a method that has been previously known,<br>
which includes holding the liquid ingredient directly<br>
on an adsorption carrier, or dissolving, emulsifying or<br>
suspending the active ingredient in water, organic<br>
solvent, water-soluble polymer or surfactant before the<br>
holding thereof on the adsorption carrier, and then<br>
passing a drying process, and further subjecting the<br>
resultant dry powder or granule to compression molding,<br>
is described in JP-A-56-7713, JP-A-60-25919, JP-A-61-<br>
207341, JP-A-11-193229, JP-A-11-35487, JP-A-2000-16934,<br>
JP-A-2000-247869, JP-A-2001-181195, JP-A-2001-316248,<br>
National Publication of International Patent<br>
Application No. 2002-534455, JP-A-2003-161, JP-A-2003-<br>
55219. In such a method it has been a problem that<br>
there are many necessary drying steps, and thus the<br>
costs of equipment which is used therein and the energy<br>
used for drying are increased.<br>
[0006]<br>
Also, JP-A-61-151116 describes a method which<br>
involves mixing an active ingredient with a surfactant<br>
or a water-soluble polymer in the presence of a<br>
nonaqueous solvent, and then removing the solvent, and<br>
JP-A-61-225121 describes a method which involves<br>
dissolving the ingredient in liquid polyethylene<br>
glycol, and then obtaining a powder or a granule,<br>
followed by the compression molding. In such a method<br>
it has been a problem that the use of the nonaqueous<br>
solvent requires the step of desolvation under heating,<br>
and thus the costs of equipment which is used therein<br>
and energy used for drying are increased. When only<br>
polyethylene glycol is used without adding a solvent,<br>
no tablet has been substantially obtained. Indeed,<br>
only a powder is described in the Examples of these<br>
references.<br>
[0007]<br>
JP-A-57-165392 discloses a method for<br>
preparing a tablet containing an active ingredient and<br>
10% or more of fat and oil based on the weight of the<br>
active ingredient. However, in such a method the<br>
active ingredient, the fat and oil component and an<br>
excipient must be formed into a dry granule using a<br>
compression roller. The extra step and the extra<br>
equipment therefor increase costs.<br>
[0008]<br>
JP-A-58-194808 describes a chewable tablet<br>
consisting of a mixture of a pretreated active<br>
ingredient composition composed of a fat and oil<br>
absorbing material, which is a typical crystalline<br>
cellulose having an edible fat and oil absorbed<br>
therein, and a binder, an antioxidant, a flavor and/or<br>
a colorant, a pretreated active ingredient composition<br>
composed of an active ingredient particle mixture, an<br>
edible oil, a binder, an emulsifier, a flavor, and a<br>
coloring agent, wherein the active ingredient particles<br>
are coated with other components such as the binder,<br>
and a pretreated auxiliary composition for direct<br>
compression tableting composed of a binder and a<br>
flavor. However, in the method described in the<br>
reference it has been a problem that in order to obtain<br>
the three kinds of compositions, the respective<br>
pretreatment steps are required and such additional<br>
steps make the preparation method complicated, and thus<br>
the cost of equipment which is used therein is<br>
expensive. In addition, such a method does not satisfy<br>
the purpose of obtaining a tablet having high hardness<br>
because it provides only a tablet with low hardness.<br>
[0009]<br>
JP-A-8-268914 discloses a solid<br>
pharmaceutical composition containing an oil or an oily<br>
substance, an active ingredient, and a water-insoluble<br>
non-bridged polymer excipient which has an average<br>
particle size of more than 150 µm and is capable of<br>
binding water, and a method for preparing the same.<br>
However, in such a method it has been a problem that<br>
the oily substance, the active ingredient, water, and<br>
the specific water-insoluble non-bridged polymer need<br>
to be stirred with high shearing force and the<br>
equipment used for this method is necessary.<br>
[0010]<br>
JP-A-2001-335469 describes a method for<br>
producing a solid preparation that is excellent in the<br>
elution of a water-insoluble bioactive ingredient and<br>
further has a proper hardness. The method includes<br>
mixing the bioactive ingredient, a nonionic surfactant<br>
and/or an anionic surfactant and allowing a water-<br>
swelling polymeric compound with a specific surface<br>
area of 5,000 cm2/g or more to support the mixture, to<br>
which a general-purpose cellulose powder is then added,<br>
followed by the compression molding. In such a method,<br>
it has been a problem that the steps of mixing the drug<br>
with the surfactant(s) and allowing the specific water-<br>
swelling polymeric compound to support the mixture are<br>
necessary, and such additional steps make the<br>
production method complicated, and thus the cost of<br>
equipment which is used therein is expensive.<br>
[0011]<br>
As described above, conventional methods have<br>
not been able to solve the problems that complex<br>
preparation processes lead to the increased cost of<br>
equipment and energy and that practical tablet hardness<br>
is not achieved at compression molding, generating<br>
exudation of liquid active ingredient and tableting<br>
disorder.<br>
[0012]<br>
An object of the present invention is to<br>
provide a cellulose powder which is excellent in<br>
compression moldability and liquid retention when used<br>
as an excipient in the preparation of molded articles<br>
containing various active ingredients. Particularly in<br>
the preparation of a medical tablet, the present<br>
invention does not generate exudation of liquid active<br>
ingredient and tableting disorder and can produce a<br>
tablet having sufficient hardness in a simple and easy<br>
production process.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0013]<br>
As the result of intensive studies for<br>
solving the above-described problems, the inventors<br>
discovered that physical properties of cellulose powder<br>
can be controlled within a specific range to provide a<br>
cellulose powder combining compression moldability and<br>
liquid ingredient retentiveness, thereby accomplishing<br>
the invention.<br>
Thus, the present invention is as follows:<br>
(1) A cellulose powder having an average<br>
polymerization degree of 150 to 450, an average<br>
particle size of 30 to 250 µm, an apparent specific<br>
volume of more than 7 cm3/g, and a retention of<br>
polyethylene glycol with a molecular weight of 400 of<br>
190% or more.<br>
(2) A method for preparing the cellulose powder<br>
described in (1) above, which includes drying a<br>
cellulose dispersion liquid containing cellulose<br>
dispersion particles composed of a natural cellulosic<br>
material hydrolyzed to have an average polymerization<br>
degree of 150 to 450 and a medium wherein the cellulose<br>
dispersion particles have an average particle size of<br>
50 µm or more.<br>
(3) A molded article composition including one or<br>
more active ingredients and the cellulose powder<br>
described in (1) above.<br>
[0014]<br>
The cellulose powder of the invention has<br>
advantages such as: the composition has desirable<br>
physical properties of compression moldability and<br>
liquid ingredient retentiveness; the composition can be<br>
produced by a simple method; and a molded article can<br>
be produced from the composition, which has proper<br>
hardness and does not exude a liquid active component<br>
or have tableting problems, particularly in "he case of<br>
the compression molding of a liquid or semisolid active<br>
ingredient as well as a solid active ingredient.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0015]<br>
The present invention is specifically<br>
described below.<br>
The cellulose powder of the invention should<br>
have an average polymerization degree of 150 to 450.<br>
An average polymerization degree of less than 150 is<br>
not preferred because of insufficient compression<br>
moldability. Also, an average polymerization degree of<br>
more than 450 tends to produce impaired moldability.<br>
This is because the hydrolysis of a raw material<br>
cellulose does not sufficiently proceed, and thus the<br>
amorphous portion of cellulose is aboundingly contained<br>
and fibrousness appears strongly to facilitate the<br>
elastic recovery. In addition, an average<br>
polymerization degree of more than 450 is not preferred<br>
because exudation of a liquid component and tableting<br>
disorder occur at compression molding even when the<br>
retention of polyethylene glycol described below is<br>
high.<br>
[0016]<br>
The cellulose powder of the invention should<br>
have an average particle size of 30 to 250 µm An<br>
average particle size of less than 30 µm is not<br>
preferred because when atomizing the particle, the<br>
surface thereof is excessively exposed to impact to<br>
reduce liquid component retentiveness. It is also not<br>
preferred because cellulose particles easily aggregate<br>
and, when mixing them with an active ingredient, the<br>
ingredient is not dispersed uniformly, thereby<br>
increasing the variation of the active ingredients of<br>
the resulting tablets. On the other hand, an average<br>
particle size of more than 250 µm is not preferred<br>
because an active ingredient is sometimes separated and<br>
segregated, during a pneumatic conveying, and this<br>
reduces content uniformity.<br>
[0017]<br>
The cellulose powder of the invention should<br>
have an apparent specific volume of more than 7.0 cm /g.<br>
An apparent specific volume of 7.0 cm3/g or less can not<br>
give sufficient dynamic strength to a lot of molded<br>
articles because of insufficient moldability. A larger<br>
apparent specific volume is preferred; the upper limit<br>
is not particularly restricted, but 13.0 cm3/g is<br>
satisfactory. More than 13.0 cm3/g is not preferred<br>
because the flowability of cellulose powders is<br>
deteriorated, cellulose particles become liable to<br>
aggregate and, when mixing them with an active<br>
ingredient, the ingredient is not dispersed uniformly,<br>
thereby increasing the variation of the active<br>
ingredient contents of the resulting tablets.<br>
[0018]<br>
The cellulose powder of the invention should<br>
have a retention of polyethylene glycol with a<br>
molecular weight of 400 of 190% or more; the rate of<br>
200% or more is preferred particularly the rate of 250%<br>
or more.<br>
For a holding capacity of polyethylene glycol<br>
with a molecular weight of 400 of 190% or more, the<br>
cellulose powder of the invention can, when the molded<br>
article containing liquid and semisolid active<br>
ingredients is subjected to compression molding, hold<br>
the liquid active ingredient and prevent the exudation<br>
thereof. A retention of polyethylene glycol with a<br>
molecular weight of 400 of less than 1.90% is not<br>
preferred because, in compression molding along with a<br>
liquid active ingredient, the liquid ingredient is not<br>
fully held to produce the exudation of the ingredient<br>
into a powder layer and thus the contact between<br>
cellulose particles that serve as a binder becomes<br>
poor, sufficient dynamic strength to the molded article<br>
can not be given, thereby producing tableting disorder.<br>
In order to set the holding capacity of<br>
polyethylene glycol with a molecular weight of 400 at<br>
190% or more, at least the average polymerization<br>
degree and the apparent specific volume need to be<br>
controlled within a predetermined range.<br>
A larger retention of polyethylene glycol is<br>
preferred; the upper limit is not particularly<br>
restricted, but 440% is satisfactory. As large as 440%<br>
will lead to the exhibition of full performance of the<br>
cellulose powder as an excipient.<br>
[0019]<br>
A method for preparing the cellulose powder<br>
of the invention is described below.<br>
The cellulose powder of the invention may be<br>
prepared, for example, by dispersing, in a suitable<br>
medium, a natural cellulosic material subjected to<br>
hydrolysis treatment, followed by drying the cellulose<br>
dispersion liquid. Here, a solid content containing<br>
the cellulosic material is subjected to hydrolysis<br>
treatment that may be isolated from the reaction<br>
solution obtained by the hydrolysis treatment, and<br>
separately dispersed in a suitable medium, followed by<br>
drying the prepared dispersion liquid, or, when the<br>
hydrolyzed solution, as it is, forms a cellulose<br>
dispersion liquid, this dispersion liquid may be<br>
directly dried.<br>
[0020]<br>
Natural cellulosic materials may be of plant<br>
or animal origin, and include, for example, those<br>
fibrous materials derived from natural products<br>
containing celluloses such as a wood, bamboo, cotton,<br>
ramie, hoya, bagasse, kanaf, or bacterial cellulose,<br>
and the natural cellulosic materials preferably have<br>
cellulose I type crystalline structure. The raw<br>
material may use one kind of natural cellulosic<br>
material from the above described materials, or may use<br>
a mixture of two or more such cellulosic materials.<br>
These are preferably used in the form of purified pulps<br>
although a method for purifying pulps is not<br>
particularly restricted; any pulp including dissolving<br>
pulp, kraft pulp, or NBKP pulp may be used.<br>
[0021]<br>
The hydrolysis method may be acid hydrolysis,<br>
alkaline oxidative decomposition, hydrothermal<br>
degradation, steam explosion, or the like, or a<br>
combination of two kinds of such methods.<br>
[0022]<br>
In the above described preparation method,<br>
the suitable medium in which the solid content<br>
containing the cellulosic material subjected to<br>
hydrolysis treatment is dispersed is not particularly<br>
restricted if it is industrially used, and may use<br>
water and/or an organic solvent. Organic solvents<br>
include, for example, alcohols such as methanol,<br>
ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, butyl alcohol, 2-<br>
methylbutyl alcohol, and benzyl alcohol, hydrocarbons<br>
such as pentane, hexane, heptane, and cyclohexane, and<br>
ketones such as acetone, and ethyl methyl ketone.<br>
Preferred organic solvents include those used in<br>
pharmaceutical preparations, for example, and<br>
classified as solvents in "IYAKUHIN TENKAZAI JITEN<br>
2000" (issued by Yakuji Nippo Limited). Water and<br>
organic solvents may be used alone or in a combination<br>
of two or more kinds; the dispersion may be once<br>
performed in one kind of medium, and removed from the<br>
medium, followed by dispersion in a different medium.<br>
[0023]<br>
The average particle size of a cellulose<br>
dispersion particle present in the cellulose dispersion<br>
liquid should be 50 µm or more. When the average<br>
particle size is less than 50 µm, even if the cellulose<br>
dispersion liquid is dried, the specific volume<br>
decreases the compression moldability decreases and the<br>
liquid component retentiveness decreases.<br>
Particularly, although a dispersion liquid of cellulose<br>
with an average particle size of less than 50 µm<br>
contains a relatively large amount of cellulose<br>
dispersion particle component, even if the dispersion<br>
liquid aboundingly contained in the particle component<br>
is dried, a cellulose powder with excellent liquid<br>
component retentiveness can not be provided because the<br>
particle component has been exposed to excessive impact<br>
on the particle surface when atomized, and thus has a<br>
changed surface structure.<br>
[0024]<br>
In order to obtain a cellulose dispersion<br>
particle with an average particle size of 50 µm or more<br>
in the above described cellulose dispersion liquid, for<br>
example, a cellulose dispersion liquid before the<br>
drying may be subjected to a controlled dehydration<br>
purification e.g. by decantation using a decanter so as<br>
to provide a water content of 40% or more.<br>
[0025]<br>
In an alternative method, cellulose<br>
dispersion particles with an average particle size of<br>
50 µm or more selected by sieving, or a dispersion<br>
liquid containing these particles may be separately<br>
dispersed in a suitable medium.<br>
In addition, these methods may be used alone<br>
or in combination.<br>
The drying method is not particularly<br>
restricted, but may be, for example, freeze-drying,<br>
spray drying, drum drying, tray drying, flash drying,<br>
vacuum drying, or drying with an organic solvent.<br>
[0026]<br>
As used herein, "molded article composition"<br>
needs to contain one or more active ingredients and the<br>
cellulose powder of the invention, and their amounts<br>
are not particularly restricted. However, the typical<br>
ranges thereof are 0.001 to 99% in the active<br>
ingredient(s) and 1 to 99% in the cellulose powder.<br>
Further, the composition may be processed by a well-<br>
known method such as mixing, stirring, granulation,<br>
sizing, or tableting.<br>
[0027]<br>
As used herein, "active ingredient" refers to<br>
a medicinal component for a medicine, an agrochemical<br>
component, a fertilizer component, a feed component, a<br>
food constituent, a cosmetic component, a dye, a<br>
perfume, a metal, a ceramic, a catalyst, or a<br>
surfactant, and may have any form including powdery,<br>
crystalline, oily, liquid, or semisolid form. The<br>
ingredient may be subjected to coating for the control<br>
of elution, the reduction of bitterness and so on.<br>
These active ingredients may be used alone or in a<br>
combination of two or more kinds.<br>
[0028]<br>
Medicinal components for medicines include,<br>
for example, antipyretic analgesic anti-inflammatory,<br>
sedative hypnotic, drowsiness preventing, dizziness<br>
suppressing, children's analgesic, stomachic, antacid,<br>
digestive, cardiotonic, antiarrhythmic, hypotensive,<br>
vasodilator, diuretic, antiulcer, intestinal function-<br>
controlling, osteoporotic, antitussive expectorant,<br>
antiasthmatic, antimicrobial, pollakiuria-improving,<br>

As used herein, "tablet" refers to a molded<br>
article obtained by compression molding that includes<br>
the cellulose powder of the invention, one or more<br>
active ingredients, and optionally other additives. A<br>
composition for a tablet, formulated with the cellulose<br>
powder of the invention has practical hardness obtained<br>

without going through a complex process; however, any<br>
preparation method including a dry granule compression<br>
method, a wet granule compression method, wet<br>
granulation compression (extragranular addition of<br>
microcrystalline cellulose), or a method for preparing<br>
a multicore tablet using, as inner core, a tablet<br>
preliminarily subjected to compression molding may be<br>
also used.<br>
[0042]<br>
Methods for preparing tablet compositions<br>
that include mainly one or more active ingredients and<br>
the cellulose powder of the invention are described<br>
below; however, these methods are only illustrative,<br>
and the advantages of the invention are not limited by<br>
these methods.<br>
An active ingredient described below may have<br>
any form of solid, liquid, and semisolid ones, and may<br>
be used alone, or by the dissolution, suspension, or<br>
emulsification thereof in a medium.<br>
[0043]<br>
Preparing methods include:<br>

active ingredient preliminarily dissolved or dispersed<br>
in a water-soluble polymer or a water-soluble polymer<br>
aqueous solution with the cellulose powder of the<br>
invention, and carrying out compression molding;<br>
(v) a method which includes mixing an active<br>
ingredient preliminarily dissolved or dispersed in a<br>
fat and oil with the cellulose powder of the invention,<br>
and carrying out compression molding. In addition, an<br>
active ingredient preliminarily dissolved in a large<br>
amount of organic solvent may be mixed with the<br>
cellulose powder of the invention, followed by<br>
compression molding using a well-known method.<br>
However, the use of this preparation method requires<br>
the drying of the resulting tablet to remove the<br>
organic solvent.<br>
[0044]<br>
Of the above described preparation methods,<br>
the method described in (i) may be adapted to mix the<br>
cellulose powder of the invention with an active<br>

components may be used alone or in a combination of two<br>
or more kinds. The order of addition and mixing of<br>
these components is not restricted; the active<br>
ingredient may be added to and mixed with the cellulose<br>

form by means of the compression molding or a method<br>
which includes preliminarily making the composition<br>
into sheet form by means of the compression molding,<br>
and cutting into a desired form may be used. A<br>
compression molding machine may use, for example, a<br>
roller type press such as a hydrostatic press, a<br>
briquetting roller type press, or a smoothing roller<br>
type press, or a compressor such as a single-punch<br>
tableting machine or a rotary tableting machine.<br>

stirring/mixing method such as a line mixer, a gas-<br>
blowing stirring/mixing method, a mixing method using a<br>
high-shear homogenizer, a high-pressure homogenizer, an<br>
ultrasonic homogenizer, or the like, or a mixing method<br>
of vessel shaking type using a shaker, or the like may<br>

components such as a disintegrator, a binder, a<br>
fluidizing agent, a lubricant, a flavoring agent, a<br>

and compression molding methods are not particularly<br>
restricted; the methods illustrated in the preparation<br>
method of (i) may be used.<br>
[0047]<br>
In the case of the method, described in (iv),<br>
which includes mixing an active ingredient<br>
preliminarily dissolved or dispersed in a water-soluble<br>
polymer or a water-soluble polymer aqueous solution<br>
with the cellulose powder of the invention and carrying<br>
out compression molding, a solubilizing agent may be<br>
optionally added in dissolving or dispersing the active<br>
ingredient in the water-soluble polymer or the water-<br>
soluble polymer aqueous solution as pretreatment. The<br>
order of addition of these components is not<br>
particularly restricted; for example, the active<br>
ingredient may be added to and mixed with the water-<br>

the dispersibility of the active ingredient in water<br>
improved by using methods (i) to (v) involving the<br>
addition of a solubilizing agent or methods (iii),<br>

2000" (issued by Yakuji Nippo Limited.) including<br>
alcohols such as methanol and ethanol and ketones such<br>
as acetone; these may be used alone or in a combination<br>
of two or more kinds.<br>
[0050]<br>

[0053]<br>
In addition to using the form of a tablet<br>
obtained by compression molding as described above, the<br>
composition for a tablet according to the invention may<br>
be used in the form of a granule or a powder<br>
particularly for the purpose of improving flowability,<br>
blocking resistance, and aggregation resistance because<br>
the composition is excellent in liguid component<br>
retentiveness.<br>
In addition, the cellulose powder of the<br>
invention has extremely high moldability compared to<br>
conventional cellulose powders, thus may allow when<br>
blended in a large quantity in a tablet, the tablet to<br>
maintains the shape thereof without disintegrating in a<br>
solvent, enabling the release of an active ingredient<br>
to be controlled. Therefore, it is also useful as a<br>
matrix-type controlled release base.<br>
Further, when a low-melting drug, a fat and<br>
oil, a liquid, and a semisolid drug, supported by an<br>
excipient or the like are subjected to tableting using<br>
a well-known method, the blending of the cellulose<br>
powder of the invention has effect of noticeably<br>
preventing the following disadvantages including<br>
sticking generated by reduced tableting pressure, and<br>
capping or lamination generated by increased tableting<br>
pressure. Particularly, the cellulose powder of the<br>
invention may avoid the above disadvantages of<br>
tableting at a smaller amount than conventionally known<br>
crystalline celluloses or powdered celluloses, and thus<br>
has the advantageous effects of enabling the drug<br>
content to be increased or to decrease the size of the<br>
tablet. When used in an amount enough to inhibit such<br>
the disadvantages of tableting, it has the following<br>
advantages which have not been found in conventional<br>
excipients, in addition to providing the tablet to high<br>
hardness and friability, in terms of having ease of<br>
handling such as the reduction of scattering and<br>
enabling the content uniformity to be ensured because<br>
the present invention does not produce separation or<br>
segregation during pneumatic conveying compared to an<br>
inorganic additive used previously as a sticking<br>
inhibitor (for example, calcium silicate, light<br>
anhydrous silicic acid, magnesium aluminometasilicate,<br>
or the like).<br>
Examples<br>
[0054]<br>
The present invention is described based on<br>
the following Examples. However, the embodiments of<br>
the invention are not intended to be limited to<br>
descriptions of these Examples.<br>
Methods for measuring various physical<br>
properties in Examples and Comparative Examples are as<br>
follows.<br>
[0055]<br>
(1) Average polymerization degree<br>
The degree used a value determined by the<br>
copper ethylenediamine solution viscosity method<br>
described in the Identification Test for Crystalline<br>
Cellulose (3) of The Japanese Parmacopoeia, Fourteenth<br>
Edition.<br>
(2) The average particle size (µm) of a cellulose<br>
particle in dispersion liquid<br>
The particle sizes were determined, by a<br>
predetermined method, using, as samples, cellulose<br>
dispersions obtained during the cellulose powder<br>
production described in Examples and Comparative<br>
Examples, employing a laser diffraction/scattering<br>
particle size distribution meter (LA-910 from Horiba,<br>
Ltd.). The average particle size was calculated in the<br>
form of the number average of volume frequencies.<br>
(3) The average particle size (µm) of a cellulose<br>
powder<br>
The average particle size of a powder sample<br>
was determined by sifting 10 g of the sample for 10<br>
minutes using a Ro-Tap type sieve shaker (Sieve Shaker<br>
A Type from Taira Kosakusho Ltd.) to measure the<br>
particle size distribution, representing as a<br>
cumulative weight 50% particle size. The average<br>
particle size of such dried cellulose powders, and the<br>
average particle size of cellulose dispersion particles<br>
in the dispersion liquid by the laser<br>
diffraction/scattering method in (2) are measured using<br>
totally different principles, and thus values obtained<br>
in the respective measurements do not correlate well<br>
with each other.<br>
(4) Apparent specific volume (cm3/g)<br>
The apparent specific volume is a value<br>
obtained by roughly filling a 100 cm3 glass measuring<br>
cylinder with a powder sample over 2 to 3 minutes using<br>
a metering feeder or the like, horizontally leveling<br>
the top face of the powder layer using a soft brush<br>
like a hair pencil, reading the volume, and dividing<br>
the read value by the weight of the powder sample. The<br>
powder weight was set as appropriate so that the volume<br>
is on the order of 70 to 100 cm3.<br>
(5) The retention (% by weight) of polyethylene glycol<br>
with an average molecular weight of 400<br>
A cellulose sample (2.0 g) was kneaded on a<br>
glass board using a spatula each time while adding<br>
dropwise polyethylene glycol (Polyethylene Glycol 400<br>
from Sanyo Chemical Industries, Ltd.) from a burette to<br>
use, as an end point, the point at which macrogol<br>
bleeds out on the powder surface to calculate a<br>
saturated retention percentage (%) employing the<br>
following calculating formula:<br>
Saturated retention = (the weight of macrogol<br>
absorbed by a cellulose powder)xlOO/(the weight of the<br>
cellulose powder)<br>
(6) Tablet hardness (N)<br>
A columnar molded article 02: a sample tablet<br>
prepared from a powder sample by a predetermined method<br>
was loaded along the diameter of the molded article or<br>
the tablet using Shleuniger hardness tester (Model 6D<br>
from Freund Industrial Co., Ltd.) to determine the load<br>
at breakage. It was represented as the number average<br>
of measurements with three samples.<br>
(7) Exudation of a liquid component<br>
The exudation of a liquid component on the<br>
tablet surface obtained by compression molding was<br>
visually observed.<br>
(8) The occurrence rate (%) of tableting disorder<br>
The occurrence rate percentage (%) of the<br>
tableting disorder was obtained by visually inspecting<br>
the tableting for sticking, chipping, capping, or<br>
lamination. The number of tablets with tableting<br>
disorder are divided by the total number of tablets to<br>
calculate the percentage.<br>

Example 1<br>
Two (2) kg of a chopped commercial pulp<br>
(polymerization degree: 1030) and 30 L of a 4 N<br>
hydrochloric acid aqueous solution for hydrolysis were<br>
placed in a low-speed stirrer (30LGL Reactor, blade<br>
diameter: about 30 cm, from Ikebukuro Horo Kogyo Co.,<br>
Ltd.) at 40°C for 24 hours for stirring ar a stirring<br>
rate of 5 rpm to provide an acid-insoluble residue<br>
having an average polymerization degree of 310. The<br>
resulting acid-insoluble residue was filtered to<br>
provide a solid content of 40% using a nutsche, which<br>
was further washed with purified water, neutralized<br>
with aqueous ammonia, and then placed in a 90-L plastic<br>
bucket, to which purified water was then added,<br>
followed by stirring at a stirring rate of 5 rpm using<br>
Three One Motor (Type 1200G, 8M/M, stirring blade<br>
diameter: 5 cm, from Heidon) to make a cellulose<br>
dispersion liquid with a solid content concentration of<br>
10% (the average particle size of a cellulose particle<br>
in the cellulose dispersion liquid was 67 µm.). This<br>
was subjected to spray drying (dispersion liquid feed<br>
rate: 6L/hr, inlet temperature: 180 to 220°C, outlet<br>
temperature: 50 to 70°C) to provide cellulose powder A.<br>
The physical properties of cellulose powder A are shown<br>
in Table 1.<br>
[0057]<br>
Example 2<br>
A commercial pulp (polymerization degree:<br>
790) was used to carry out the same operation in<br>
Example 1 except for setting hydrolysis time to 48<br>
hours to provide an acid-insoluble residue with an<br>
average polymerization degree of 270. The resulting<br>
acid-insoluble residue was filtered, neutralized, and<br>
stirred using the same operation as that in Example 1<br>
to provide a cellulose dispersion liquid with a solid<br>
content concentration of 22% (the average particle size<br>
of a cellulose particle in the cellulose dispersion<br>
liquid was 54 µm. ). The resulting cellulose dispersion<br>
liquid was also subjected to spray drying using the<br>
same operation in Example 1 to provide cellulose powder<br>
B. The physical properties of cellulose powder B are<br>
shown in Table 1.<br>
[0058]<br>
Example 3<br>
A commercial pulp (polymerization degree:<br>
840) was used to carry out the same operation in<br>
Example 1 except for setting hydrolysis conditions to a<br>
5 N hydrochloric acid aqueous solution, 40°C, and 60<br>
hours to provide an acid-insoluble residue with an<br>
average polymerization degree of 160. The resulting<br>
acid-insoluble residue was washed using purified water<br>
without filtering, and neutralized. And then by means<br>
of a sieve with an opening of 38 µm without stirring,<br>
the passing material was then removed to provide a<br>
cellulose dispersion liquid with a solid content<br>
concentration of 10% (the average particle size of a<br>
cellulose particle in the cellulose dispersion liquid<br>
was 59 µm.). The resulting cellulose dispersion liquid<br>
was subjected to spray drying using the same operation<br>
in Example 1 to provide cellulose powder C. The<br>
physical properties of cellulose powder C are shown in<br>
Table 1.<br>
[0059]<br>
Example 4<br>
A commercial pulp (polymerization degree:<br>
790) was used to carry out the same operation in<br>
Example 1 except for setting hydrolysis conditions to a<br>
5 N hydrochloric acid aqueous solution, 40°C, 4 hours,<br>
and a stirring rate of 30 rpm to provide an acid-<br>
insoluble residue with an average polymerization degree<br>
of 440. The resulting acid-insoluble residue was<br>
filtered and neutralized using the same operation as<br>
that in Example 1, and then stirred at a stirring rate<br>
of 500 rpm to provide a cellulose dispersion liquid<br>
with a solid content concentration of 17% (the average<br>
particle size of a cellulose particle in the cellulose<br>
dispersion liquid was 51 µm.). The resulting cellulose<br>
dispersion liquid was dried using a drum dryer (from<br>
Kusunoki Co., Ltd., Model KDD-1, steam pressure: 0.35<br>
MPa, drum surface temperature: 136°C, drum rotation<br>
number: 2 rpm, temperature of the aqueous dispersion in<br>
a liquid-storing portion of the drum dryer: 100°C) ,<br>
pulverized by a hammer mill, and by means of a sieve<br>
with an opening of 425 µm, coarse particles were then<br>
removed to provide cellulose powder D. The physical<br>
properties of cellulose powder D are shown in Table 1.<br>
[0060]<br>
Example 5<br>
A pulverized commercial pulp (polymerization<br>
degree: 1030) was immersed in a sodium hypochlorite<br>
solution with an available chlorine of 1.6 g/L to set<br>
pH to 10.9, and this was treated at 60°C for 6 hours.<br>
The treated pulp was well washed with water, subjected<br>
to centrifugal dehydration and then to blast drying at<br>
105°C, and pulverized for 10 minutes using a household<br>
mixer. The resulting pulverized pulp (2 kg) was<br>
hydrolyzed, under conditions of 4 N hydrochloric acid<br>
aqueous solution, 40°C, and 15 hours, using the same<br>
method as that in Example 1 to provide an acid-<br>
insoluble residue having an average polymerization<br>
degree of 300. The resulting acid-insoluble residue<br>
was filtered, neutralized, and stirred using the same<br>
operation in Example 1 to provide a cellulose<br>
dispersion liquid with a solid content concentration of<br>
10% (the average particle size of a cellulose particle<br>
in the cellulose dispersion liquid was 65 µm.). The<br>
resulting cellulose dispersion liquid was subjected to<br>
the spray drying using the same operation in Example 1<br>
to provide cellulose powder E. The physical properties<br>
of cellulose powder E are shown in Table 1.<br>
[0061]<br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
The hydrolysis was carried out using the same<br>
operation in Example 1 except for setting hydrolysis<br>
conditions to 3 N hydrochloric acid aqueous solution,<br>
40°C, and 20 hours and a stirring rate of 20 rpm during<br>
reaction to provide an acid-insoluble residue having an<br>
average polymerization degree of 440. The resulting<br>
acid-insoluble residue was filtered to provide a solid<br>
content of 70% using a nutsche. The resulting<br>
filtration residue was further washed with purified<br>
water, neutralized with aqueous ammonia, and then<br>
placed in a 90-L plastic bucket, to which purified<br>
water was then added, followed by stirring at a<br>
stirring rate of 100 rpm using the same operation as<br>
that in Example 1 to make a cellulose dispersion liquid<br>
with a solid content concentration of 6% (the average<br>
particle size of a cellulose particle in the cellulose<br>
dispersion liquid was 41 µm.). The resulting cellulose<br>
dispersion liquid was subjected to the spray drying<br>
using the same operation in Example 1 to provide<br>
cellulose powder F (corresponding to Example 7 in<br>
WO02/02643 above). The physical properties of<br>
cellulose powder F are shown in Table 1.<br>
[0062]<br>
Comparative Example 2<br>
The hydrolysis was carried out using the same<br>
operation in Example 1 except for setting hydrolysis<br>
conditions to 0.14 N hydrochloric acid aqueous<br>
solution, 121°C, and 1 hour and a stirring rate during<br>
reaction of 30 rpm to provide an acid-insoluble residue<br>
having an average polymerization degree of 220. The<br>
resulting acid-insoluble residue was filtered to<br>
provide a solid content of 70% using a nutsche. The<br>
resulting filtration residue was further washed with<br>
purified water, neutralized with aqueous ammonia, and<br>
then placed in a 90-L plastic bucket, to which purified<br>
water was then added, followed by stirring at a<br>
stirring rate of 500 rpm using the same operation in<br>
Example 1 to make a cellulose dispersion liquid with a<br>
solid content concentration of 17% (the average<br>
particle size of a cellulose particle in the cellulose<br>
dispersion liquid was 29 µm.). The resulting cellulose<br>
dispersion liquid was subjected to the spray drying as<br>
described in Example 1, from which, using a sieve with<br>
an opening of 325 mesh, coarse particles were then<br>
removed to provide cellulose powder G (corresponding to<br>
Example 1 in JP-B-40-26274 above). The physical<br>
properties of cellulose powder G are shown in Table 1.<br>
[0063]<br>
Comparative Example 3<br>
A pulp sheet in which acicular and broad leaf<br>
trees were mixed and dissolved (a-cellulose: 90.5%, b-<br>
cellulose: 4.7%, cuprammonium relative viscosity: 4.70,<br>
whiteness degree: 93) was ground and immersed in a<br>
sodium hypochlorite solution with an available chlorine<br>
content of 1.6 g/L to set pH to 10.9, and this was<br>
treated at 60°C for 310 minutes (the average particle<br>
size of a cellulose particle in the cellulose<br>
dispersion liquid was 50 µm.). The treated pulp was<br>
well washed with water, and subjected to centrifugal<br>
dehydration and then to blast drying at 105°C. This<br>
pulp was pulverized for 15 minutes using a household<br>
mixer (Model SM-L56, from Sanyo Electric Co., Ltd.),<br>
and then, by a sieve with an opening of 80 mesh, coarse<br>
particles were then removed to provide cellulose powder<br>
H (corresponding to Example 2 in JP-A-50-19917 above).<br>
The physical properties of cellulose powder H are shown<br>
in Table 1.<br>
[0064]<br>
Comparative Example 4<br>
A commercial pulp (polymerization degree:<br>
1030) (500 g) was pulverized for 30 minutes in a<br>
household mixer (Model SM-L56, from Sanyo Electric Co.,<br>
Ltd.), and then, by a sieve with an opening of 150 µm,<br>
coarse particles were then removed to provide cellulose<br>
powder I (the average particle size cf a cellulose<br>
particle in a cellulose dispersion liquid can not be<br>
described because of bypassing a cellulose dispersion).<br>
The physical properties of cellulose powder I are shown<br>
in Table 1.<br>
[0065]<br>
Comparative Example 5<br>
Cellulose powder G obtained in Comparative<br>
Example 2 was pulverized using a pneumatic pulverizer<br>
(Single Track Jet Mill Model STJ-200 from Seishin<br>
Enterprise Co., Ltd.) to provide cellulose powder J<br>
(corresponding to Example 1 in JP-A-63-267731 above).<br>
The physical properties of cellulose powder J are shown<br>
in Table 1.<br>
[0066]<br>
Comparative Example 6<br>
Cellulose powder F obtained in Comparative<br>
Example 1 was subjected to the removal of coarse<br>
particles using a sieve with an opening of 75 µm on an<br>
air jet sieve (from Alpine Co.), and fine particles<br>
were then removed using a sieve with an opening of 38<br>
µm (a method described in Examples of JP-A-11-152233<br>
above) to provide cellulose powder K. The physical<br>
properties of cellulose powder K are shown in Table 1.<br>
[0067]<br>
Comparative Example 7<br>
The hydrolysis was carried out using the same<br>
operation as that in Example 1 except for setting<br>
hydrolysis conditions to 0.14 N hydrochloric acid<br>
aqueous solution, 121°C, and 1 hour and a stirring rate<br>
of 30 rpm during reaction to provide an acid-insoluble<br>
residue having an average polymerization degree of 220.<br>
The resulting acid-insoluble residue was filtered to<br>
provide a solid content of 70% using a nutsche. The<br>
filtration residue was further washed with purified<br>
water, neutralized with aqueous ammonia, and then<br>
placed in a 90-L plastic bucket, to which purified<br>
water was then added, followed by stirring at a<br>
stirring rate of 500 rpm using the same operation in<br>
Example 1 to make a cellulose dispersion liquid with a<br>
solid content concentration of 4% (the average particle<br>
size of a cellulose particle in the cellulose<br>
dispersion liquid was 29 µm.). The resulting cellulose<br>
dispersion liquid was subjected to spray drying using<br>
the same operation as that in Example 1, from which,<br>
using a sieve with an opening of 400 mesh, coarse<br>
particles were then removed to provide cellulose powder<br>
L (corresponding to a bulk density of 8.92 cm3/g in JP-<br>
B-40-26274 above). The physical properties of<br>
cellulose powder L are shown in Table 1.<br>
[0068]<br>
Examples 6 to 10<br>
To 10 g of a commercial crystalline cellulose<br>
(Avicel PH-101 from Asahi Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.)<br>
was added 6.5 g of macrogol 400 (from Sanyo Chemical<br>
Industries, Ltd.) as one example of a liquid active<br>
ingredient, followed by stirring and mixing for 10<br>
minutes using a spatula in a glass beaker, to which 2.5<br>
g of light anhydrous silicic acid (Aerosil 200 from<br>
Nippon Aerosil Co., Ltd.) was further added, followed<br>
by stirring and mixing for 5 minutes using a spatula.<br>
3.5 g of the resulting mixed powder was mixed with each<br>
1.5 g of celluloses A to E obtained in Examples 1 to 5<br>
in polyethylene bags for 3 minutes (the final<br>
compositional weight ratio in each mixed powder is<br>
cellulose powder/PH-101/Aerosil/macrogol =<br>
30/37.8/9.5/22.7).<br>
In a mortar (using the material SUK2, 3, from<br>
Kikusui Seisakusho Ltd.) was placed 0.2 g of each of<br>
the resulting mixed powder samples which was then<br>
compressed at a compression stress of 100 MPa employing<br>
a circular plane pestle (using the material SUK2, 3,<br>
from Kikusui Seisakusho Ltd.). The compression was<br>
kept for 10 seconds to produce a columnar molded<br>
article (PCM-1A from Aikoh Engineering Co., Ltd. was<br>
used as a compressor). The hardness of the resulting<br>
each columnar molded article is shown in Table 2.<br>
Here, as the result of observing tablet surface<br>
appearance and adhesion to the pestle with eyes, no<br>
tablet showed exudation of a liquid component and also<br>
adhesion of the tablet composition to the pestle.<br>
[0069]<br>
Comparative Examples 8 to 14<br>
Cellulose powders F to L obtained in<br>
Comparative Examples 1 to 7 were used as cellulose<br>
powders to provide columnar molded articles using a<br>
similar operation to that in Examples 6 to 1C. The<br>
hardness of resulting each columnar molded article is<br>
shown in Table 2. As the result the tablet surface<br>
appearance and adhesion to the pestle was observed to<br>
be in a similar way to Examples 6 to 10, all tablets<br>
showed exudation of a liquid component and adhesion of<br>
the tablet composition to the pestle, and the tableting<br>
disorder of sticking had been generated.<br>
In addition, cellulose powders H and I, which<br>
have an average polymerization degree of more than 450,<br>
are considered to have produced exudation of the liquid<br>
component on the tablet surface and tableting disorder<br>
during compression probably because, while they have a<br>
high retention of polyethylene glycol, the liquid<br>
component is retained not in an intraparticular space<br>
but in an interparticular one.<br>
Any of the tablets using cellulose powders A<br>
to E obtained by the operations in Examples 1 to 5<br>
showed a hardness of 40 N or more, and did have a<br>
practical tablet hardness (40 N or more) at which<br>
tablets are generally considered not to be abraded when<br>
they are conveyed in a process or transported in a<br>
state stored within a bottle. In contrast, the tablets<br>
using cellulose powders F to K obtained by the<br>
operations in Comparative Examples 1 to 6 only showed a<br>
hardness of less than 40 N, and did not have a<br>
practical tablet hardness.<br>
[0070]<br>
Example 11<br>
500 g of a commercial crystalline cellulose<br>
(Avicel PH-301 from Asahi Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.)<br>
was added to 150 g of commercial dl-a-tocopherol (from<br>
Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd.) dissolved in<br>
macrogol 400 at a weight ratio of 1:1, with stirring at<br>
a stirring rate of 63 rpm using a planetary mixer (the<br>
universal mixing stirrer 50M-03-R from Sanei Seisakusho<br>
Co., Ltd.), which was then mixed for 10 minutes,<br>
followed by further adding 65.3 g of Aerosil 200 before<br>
mixing for 5 minutes. With 350 g of the resulting<br>
mixed powder was mixed cellulose powder A in a<br>
polyethylene bag for 3 minutes, to which magnesium<br>
stearate (from Taihei Chemical Industrial Co., Ltd.)<br>
was then added in an amount of 0.5 wt% based on the<br>
total weight of the mixed powder, followed by further<br>
mixing for 0.5 minute to provide a mixed powder for<br>
tableting (the final compositional weight ratio in the<br>
mixed powder is cellulose powder/PH-101/Aerosil/the<br>
macrogol solution of drug/magnesium stearate<br>
=30/49/6.3/14.7/0.5).<br>
The mixed powder was subjected to tableting<br>
at a turn table rotation rate of 22 rpm and compressive<br>
forces of 5,000 N, 10,000N, and 15,000 N using a<br>
circular plane pestle 0.8 cm in diameter in a rotary<br>
tableting machine (Cleanpress Correct 12HUK, Stirring<br>
Feeder, from Kikusui Seisakusho Ltd.) to make tablets<br>
each having a weight of 170 mg. The physical<br>
properties of the tablets are shown in Table 3. As the<br>
result of visual observation of the tablet surface<br>
appearance and its adhesion to the pestle no tablet<br>
showed exudation of a liquid component and tableting<br>
disorders such as adhesion of the tablet composition to<br>
the pestle. In addition, each of the tablets showed a<br>
hardness of 40 N or more, and had a practical tablet<br>
hardness (40 N or more) at which tablets are generally<br>
considered not to be abraded when they are conveyed in<br>
a process or transported in a state stored within a<br>
bottle.<br>
[0071]<br>
Comparative Example 15<br>
Tablets were produced using the same<br>
operation in Example 11 except for using cellulose<br>
powder H prepared in Comparative Example 3 in place of<br>
cellulose powder A from Example 11. The physical<br>
properties of the tablets are shown in Table 3. The<br>
tablets had the tableting disorder such as lanination<br>
that generated insufficient hardness probably because<br>
they could not retain a liquid component exuded under<br>
high tableting pressure.<br>
[0072]<br>
Example 12<br>
In a polyethylene bag for 3 minutes, 200 g of<br>
commercial ibuprofen pulverized with a small-size<br>
pulverizer (screen diameter ¢: 1.5 mm, 1,4000 rpm) , 265<br>
g of a commercial granulated lactose "Super-Tab" (from<br>
Lactose New Zealand Ltd.) 25 g of cellulose powder E of<br>
the invention, and 10 g of croscarmellose sodium<br>
(Nichirin Chemical Industries, Ltd.) were mixed, to<br>
which 2.5 g of magnesium stearate (Taihei Chemical<br>
Industrial Co., Ltd.) was then added, followed by<br>
further slowly mixing for 30 seconds to make a mixed<br>
powder. The mixed powder was subjected to tableting at<br>
a turn table rotation rate of 54 rpm and a compressive<br>
force of 6,000 N using a 0.8-cm-diameter R pestle (12R)<br>
having an impression on the top surface in a rotary<br>
tableting machine (Cleanpress Correct 12HUK, Open<br>
Feeder, from Kikusui Seisakusho Ltd.). The results are<br>
shown in Table 4. The sticking rate (the percentage<br>
obtained by dividing the number of tablets that stick<br>
by the total number of tablets was observed usually and<br>
was 0% after tableting for 30 minutes.<br>
[0073]<br>
Comparative Example 16<br>
When 25 g of light anhydrous silicic acid<br>
(from Nippon Aerosil Co., Ltd.) was used in place of<br>
cellulose powder E of the invention, tableting was<br>
carried out using a similar operation to that in<br>
Example 12. The results are shown in Table 4. As for<br>
the tablet obtained by tableting for 30 minutes, the<br>
sticking occurred, and other tableting disorders such<br>
as the generation of crack on the tablet surface were<br>
also induced, and the hardness did not satisfy a<br>
practical hardness (40 N or more). In addition, as the<br>
result of testing 20 tablets under conditions of 25 rpm<br>
and 4 minutes using a friability tester (Pharma Test,<br>
from Japan Machinery Co.), the tablets had high weight<br>
reduction rates (friability) and were not desirable<br>
tablets.<br>
