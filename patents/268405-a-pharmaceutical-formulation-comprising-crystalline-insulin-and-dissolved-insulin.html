INSULIN<br>
INTRODUCTION<br>
The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical formulation of dissolved insulin, an<br>
analogue or derivative thereof and crystalline insulin, or an analogue or derivative thereof. The<br>
preparations have superior chemical characteristics.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the treatment of diabetes mellitus, many varieties of insulin preparations have been<br>
suggested and used, such as regular insulin, Semilente® insulin, isophane insulin, insulin zinc<br>
suspensions, protamine zinc insulin, and Ultralente* insulin. As diabetic patients are treated with<br>
insulin for several decades, there is a major need for safe and life quality improving insulin<br>
preparations. Some of the commercial available insulin preparations are characterized by a fast<br>
onset of action and other preparations have a relatively slow onset but show a more or less<br>
prolonged action. Fast acting insulin preparations are usually solutions of insulin, while retarded<br>
acting insulin preparations can be suspensions containing insulin in crystalline and/or<br>
amorphous form precipitated by addition of zinc salts alone or by addition of protamine or by a<br>
combination of both.<br>
In addition, some patients are using preparations having both a fast onset of action and<br>
a more prolonged action, Such a preparation may be an insulin solution wherein protamine<br>
insulin crystals are suspended. The invention relates to such a suspension in a premixed form.<br>
Acta Pharmaceutica Nordica 4(4), 1992, pp. 149-158 discloses insulin preparations in<br>
which the NaCI concentration has been varied in the range of 0 to 250 mM. The major part of<br>
the preparations, including all preparations which additionally comprise glycerol, contains a<br>
rather high amount of NaCI, i.e. 0.7% corresponding approximately to a concentration of 120<br>
mM. It is stated in this document that whereas NaCI has a stabilizing effect on insulin<br>
preparations, glycerol and glucose leads to increased chemical deterioration.<br>
US 5866538 discloses insulin preparations with glycerol and/or mannitol and low NaCI<br>
concentrations. This reference does not describe suspensions or the presence of protamine.<br>
US 6127334 discloses suspensions of insulin AspB28 containing hydrochloric acid,<br>
ZnCI2 solution, protamine sulphate solution, m-cresol, phenol, glycerol, disodium<br>
monohydrogenphosphate and water. Other examples include the ingredients above including<br>
mannitol and/or NaCI and/or LysB28-ProB29-insulin. The examples thus differs in as well<br>
ingredients as methods of preparing the formulation. The preparations snivs the problem of<br>
providing suspensions which are resistant to physical stress.<br>
US 5547930 describes solutions of AspB28 insulin containing hydrochloric acid, ZnCI2<br>
solution, protamine sulphate solution, m-cresol, phenol, glycerol, di-sodium<br>
monohydrogenphosphate and water. The examples thus differs in as well ingredients as<br>
methods of preparing.<br>
The invention thus provides a novel formulation for insulin suspensions, and a novel<br>
method of preparing the formulation.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
By "insulin analogue" as used herein is meant a polypeptide which has a molecular<br>
structure which formally can be derived from the structure of a naturally occurring insulin, for<br>
example that of human insulin, by deleting and/or substituting at least one amino acid residue<br>
occurring in the natural insulin and/or by adding at least one amino acid residue. The<br>
added and/or substituted amino acid residues can either be codable amino acid residues or<br>
other naturally occurring amino acid residues or purely synthetic amino acid residues. In an<br>
aspect of the invention a maximum of 6 amino acids are amended. In an aspect of the invention<br>
a maximum of 5 amino acids are amended. In an aspect of the invention a maximum of<br>
4 amino acids are amended. In an aspect of the invention a maximum of 3 amino acids are<br>
amended. In an aspect of the invention a maximum of 2 amino acids are amended. In an aspect<br>
of the invention 1 amino acids is amended.<br>
The insulin analogues may be such wherein position 28 of the B chain may be<br>
modified from the natural Pro residue to Asp, Lys, or He. Also, Asn at position A21 may be<br>
modified to Ala, Gin, Glu, Gly, His, lie, Leu, Met, Ser, Thr, Trp, Tyr or Val, in particular to Gly,<br>
Ala, Ser, or Thr and preferably to Gly. Furthermore, Asn at position B3 may be modified to<br>
Lys or Asp. Further examples of insulin analogues are des(B30) human insulin, insulin<br>
analogues wherein one or both of B1 and B2 have been deleted; insulin analogues wherein<br>
the A-chain and/or the B-chain have an N-terminal extension and insulin analogues wherein<br>
the A-chain and/or the B-chain have a C-terminal extension. Further insulin analogues are<br>
such wherein. One or more of B26-B30 have been deleted. If one or more of the amino acid<br>
residues in the positions B26-B30 have been deleted the C-terminal amino acid residue of<br>
the B-chain will Lys. In an aspect of the invention the insulin analogue is AspB28.<br>
By "insulin derivative" as used herein is meant a naturally occurring insulin or an insulin<br>
analogue which has been chemically modified, e.g. by introducing a side chain in one or<br>
more positions of the insulin backbone or by oxidizing or reducing groups of the amino acid<br>
residues in the insulin or by converting a free carboxylic group to an ester group or to an am<br>
ide group. Other derivatives are obtained by acylating a free amino group or a hydroxy<br>
group.<br>

1.17 g sodium chloride in Water for Injection. 1.55 g phenol, 1.77 g metacresol, 16 g glycerol<br>
and 4.32 g sodium hydroxide 2N was added during mixing. The pH of the solution was<br>
measured to approx. 9 and water was added to 900 ml. Solution II was prepared by dissolving<br>
1.17 g sodium chloride, 1.77 g metacresol, 1.55 g phenol and 16 g glycerol in water.<br>
Then 0,45 g protamine sulphate in solution was added to the solution while mixing and 7.5 g<br>
of AspB28 human insulin dissolved in water by adding to it 3.4 g P N hyrirorhiorin arid and 1 04 g<br>
zinc chloride solution (4 mg/ml),"was added to the solution while mixing. Water ad 800 ml<br>

Solution I was prepared, by dissolving 2.50 g disodium phosphate dihydrate and<br>
0,88 g sodium chloride in Water for Injection, 1.24 g phenol, 8 g glycerol and 4.6 g sodium<br>
hydroxide 2N was added during mixing. The pH of the solution was measured to approx. 10<br>
and water was added to 450 ml, Solution II was prepared by dissolving 0.88 g sodium chloride,<br>
1,24 g phenol and 4 g glycerol in water, Then 0.64 g protamine sulphate in solution was<br>
added to the solution while mixing and 7.5 g of AspB28human insulin dissolved in water by<br>
adding to it 3.4 g 2 N hydrochloric acid and 1,04 g zinc chloride solution (4 mg/ml), was added<br>
to the solution while mixing. Water ad 500 ml was added. The solutions were mixed and the<br>
pH of the suspension was, if necessary, readjusted to approx. 7.2 by adding sodium hydroxide<br>
or hydrochloric acid. Water ad 1000 ml was added.<br>
The resulting suspension was now allowed to crystallise. The shape of the crystals<br>
and the amount of amorphous particles were checked by microscopy,<br>
Solution III was prepared, by dissolving 0.62 g phenol, 3.54 g of metacresol and 16<br>
g of glycerol. Water was added to 900 ml. Solution III and the crystallization mixture were<br>
mixed and the pH of the suspension was, if necessary, readjusted to 7.2 by adding sodium<br>
hydroxide or hydrochloric acid. Water ad 2000 ml was added.<br>
In the resulting preparation, the weight ratio of precipitated to dissolved insulin was<br>
70:30.<br><br><br><br>
We claim:<br>
1. A method for preparing a pharmaceutical product comprising Asp^^^human<br>
insulin, protamine, Zn^*, Isotonlclty agent, a phenolic compound and salt In the<br>
amount of 7 to 40 mM, wherein the weight ratio of dissolved to crystalline<br>
Asp^^^human insulin is 30:70, said method comprising the steps of:<br>
a. providing an acidic solution comprising Asp^^^human Insulin, a source of<br>
Zn*^ and a suitable amount of protamine;<br>
b. providing an alkaline solution comprising a substance which acts as a<br>
buffer at physiological pH;<br>
