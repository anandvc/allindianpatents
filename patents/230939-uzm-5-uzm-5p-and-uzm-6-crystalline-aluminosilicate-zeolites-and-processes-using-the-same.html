				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Zeolites    are    crystalline    aluminosiiicate    compositions    which    are mJcroporcus: and which have a three-dimensional oxide framework formed 'from corner sharing A1O2 and SiOa tetrahedra.    Numerous zeolites:, both naturally occurring and synthetically prepared are used in various industrial processes. Zeolites are characterized by having pore openings of uniform dimensions, 'having a significant ion exchange capacity, and being capable of reversibly desorbing an 'adsorbed phase which is dispersed throughout the internal voids of • the- crystal without significantly displacing -any atoms which 'iriiake  up. ythS .permanent zeolite .crystal structure.<br>
The number of synthetic zeolites is well.over a hundred as; evidenced by tne xtlas.. of Zeolite Structure Types published by the Internationa! Zeolite Associa'tiori (IZA).  As is well known, zeolites are.distinguisfie'd .frc|rn;each other on tfhe basis of their composition, crystal .structure -and 'adsorption. properties,-One rnethod commonly used in the art to distinguish zeolites is x-ray diffraction, ..

The value, of "x" which is the mole fraction-of E varies" from ;0 to 0.5, The ' ratio of silicon to (AkE) is represented by "y" which varies from 5;;to. 12, While -.the '• mole; .ratiO;;.pf O: to._(AI+.E) is represented by "'z" and '" has::a;value given;';t)y-"ttle;./. equation:,.. (Equatiion Removed)<br>
VVhen .M Is only one metal, "then the weighted average, 'valence is the: valence of,that one'metal, i.e. +1 -or +2,. However, when more".than, orie lyi metat;- '• :is present; the total,amount of:-' <br>

arid the weighted average valence "p" is given by the equation: .<br>
(Equatiion Removed)These,   aluminosilicate   zeolites,   are . prepared   by   a   hydrothermal: crystallization of a reaction mixture prepared by combining reactive sources of R, aluminum, optionally E and/or M<and silicon in aqueous media. accordingly the aluminum sources include but. are. not limited to .aluminum alkoxides precipitated alumina hydroxide salts and metal. specific examples of are ito ortho-sec-butoxide ortho-isopropqxide. silica include. but tetraethylorthosilicat silicas colloidal silica. m metals but: halide nitrate acetate respective alkali or alkaline earth metals. .e elements .include limited: berates boric acid gallium loxyhydroxide sulfate ferric chloride chromium></and>

hydroxide,      tetraethylammoniurn '   hydroxide,      hexamethonium     bromide,<br>
tetramethylammonium chloride, methyltriethylamrnonium hydroxide, R may also •be neutral amines, diamines, and alkanoiamines, Specific examples are triethanolarnine, trtethyfamine, and N&gt;J,N',N' tetramethyl-I.S-hexanediamine.' -<br>
The reaction mixture containing reactive sources of the desired components can be described in terms of molar ratios of the oxides by thev forrnufa:<br>
where "a" is the mole ratio of the oxide of M and has a value of 0 to 2, "fo" is -the mole ratio of the oxide of R and has a value of 1.5 to 30, "d" is the mole ratio of silica and has a value of 5 to 30, "c" .is the mole ratio of the oxide of E and.-has.a value from, 0 to;'d,-5,;and v"e":;is the mole, ratio of water and has a value of 30 'to1 .6000. The reaction ..mixture is now reacted at reaction conditions Including :a-temperature of 100°C to 175°C and preferably from 140°C to 160°C for a period<br>
'	....	)<br>
-of 12 hours to 14 days and preferably for a time of 2 days to 5 days in a sealed reaction vessel under autogenous pressure. After crystallization is complete, the solid,! product is isolated from the heterogeneous mixture by means such as filtration or centrifugation, and then washed with de-ionized water and dried in air at ambient temperature up to 100°C.<br>
As synthesized, the zeolites will contain some of the exchangeable or<br>
!	'<br>
charge balancing cations in its pores. These exchangeable cations can be exchanged for other cations, or in the case of organic cations, they can be removed by heating under controlled conditions. All of these methods are we!! known: in the art.<br>
The   crystalline   zeolites   are'  characterized   by   a   three-dimensional - framework structure of at least'SiO2 and AlOa tetrahedra! units. These zeolites are further characterized by their unique x-ray diffraction pattern.   The x-ray-diffraction pattern has at least two. peaks: one peak at a c/-spacing of 3,9±Q,12A and one peak at-a-c/-spacing of 8,6±0,20A.   To allow for ready reference,, the different structure types and compositions of crystalline zeolites have been given arbitrary designation of UZM-h, where "h" is an integer starting at one and where for example "1" represents a framework of structure type "1",   That is one .or more zeolitic. composition with different empirical formulas can have the same structure type "h", e.g. <br>
in .this respect,'"the following species can be identified by their.x-ray<br>

: Although the zeolites can be used alone, it is preferable that the zeolite be mixed with a binder for convenient formation of catalyst particles in a proportion of. 5, to 100 mass % zeolite and 0 to 95 mass-% binder, with the zeolite<br>
preferably comprising from 10 to 90 mass-% of the composite.    The binder<br>
should preferably be porous, have a surface area of 5 to 800 m2/g, and relatively ' refractory to the conditions utilized-in the hydrocarbon conversion process, Non-• limiting examples of binders are aluminas, titania, zirconia, .zinc oxide, magnesia, boria, silica-alumina,  siiica-magnesia, chrornia-alumina,  alumina-boria,  silica-. zirconia, silica, silica gel, and clays. Preferred binders are amorphous silica and 1 alumina, including gamma-, .eta-, and theta-alumina,' with gamma- and eta-alumina being especially preferred.<br>
,..;. . The zeolite with, or without a binder can be formed into various shape's "<br>
'such as pills, pellets, extrudates, spheres, etc.  Preferred shapes are extrudates<br>

,..„ ..Spheres:can be prepared by the well known oil-drop method which .is described in.US-A-2,620,314 which is incorporated by reference. The method involves; dropping a mixture of zeolite, and for example, alumina sol, and gelling agent into an oil bath maintained at elevated temperatures. The droplets of the mixture remain in the oil bath until they set and form hydrogel spheres. The spheres are then continuously withdrawn from the oil bath and typically<br>
subjected to specific aging treatments In oil and an amrnoniacai solution to /further improve their physical characteristics. The resulting aged and gelled<br>
particles are then washed and dried at a relatively low temperature of 50-200°G<br>
and subjected to a calcination procedure at a temperature, of 450-700°C for a period of 1 to 20 hours. This treatment effects conversion of the hyciroge! to the corresponding alumina matrix.-<br>

alkylarbmatic-containing streams such as catalytic reformate with or without subsequent aromatics extraction to produce specified xytene isomers and partieuiarly to produce para-xylene. A C8-aromatics feed to the present process<br>
may contain nonarornatic hydrocarbons,'i.e., naphtheries and paraffins, in an amount up to 30 rnass-%.   Preferably the isomerizable hydrocarbons consist<br>
•essentially of arornatics, however, to ensure pure products from dovynstream<br>

the alkylatibn and preferably the mbnoalkylation of aromatic compounds involves  reacting  an  aromatic 'compound  with   ari' olefin   using:;the   above'<br>

of those which cbntaih frorfi 2 up to 20 carbon atoms.'.These"oliefins rhay.be<br>
branched or linear oiefihs and either terminal or internal olefins. •'• Preferred olefihsi<br>
are jethylene, propylene and those olefins which are known as detergent.range ..<br>
oiefins. Detergent range olefins are linear olefins containing from 6 up through 20 :<br>
'carbbn atoms which have either internal or terminal double bonds.  Linear, blefins<br>
containing from 8 to 16 carbon atoms are preferred and those containing from 10 up to 14 carbon atoms are especially preferred!<br>
The alkylatable aromatic compounds may be selected from the group consisting of benzene, naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene, and substituted derivatives thereof, with benzene and its derivatives being the most preferred<br>
i<br>
aromatic compound.  By alkylatable is meant that the aromatic compound can be<br>
I<br>
alkylated by an olefinic compound, The aikylatabie aromatic compounds may-have<br>
i<br>
one or more of the substituents selected from the group consisting-of alkyl groups (having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms), hy.droxy! groups, and alkoxy groups .whose alky! group also contains from, 1 up to 20 carbon atoms. Where tha substituent is . an 'alky! or alkoxy group, a phenyl group can also can be substituted on the alky! chain.    Although ..unsubstituted. and monosubstituted benzenes, naphthalenes,  -<br>
. anthracenes,..,and phenanthrenes are most often. used in the ^practice of this; invention, rpqlys;wbstituted aromatics -also .may be. employed.. - ^camples of suitable^ . al,kylatab!e.aro.matic,cornp'ounds.in .addition to those .cited above include 'bipfteriyj,.<br>

The ••particular: conditions' under ..which  the   monoalkylation ^reaction ^i^'1'<br>
conducted .depends, upon the, aromatic compound and the olefin used. .'One<br>
necessary, condition is that, the .reaction be conducted under- at least partial liquid. ••<br>
phase conditions.. Therefore, the reaction pressure is adjusted to maintain the<br>
	'	.         '<br>
olefin ;at least partially dissolved in the liquid phase. For higher olefins the reaction<br>
may b'e conducted at autogenous pressure.   As a practical matter' the pressure normally is in the range between 1379 and 6985 kPa (200-1000 psig) but usually is in a,range between 2069-4137 kPa (300-600 psig). The alkylation of the alkylatable ' aromatic compounds with the olefins in the C2-C20 range can be carried out at a<br>
.temperature of 60°C to 400°C/and preferably from 90°C to 250°C, for a time<br>
:<br>

;.. considerably, but is usually fronrQ.'i to 3 hrVeight hourly space velocity with<br>
i	•<br>
respect to the oiefin.  In particular, 'the alkylation of benzene with ethylene can be carried out at temperatures of 2QQ°C to 250°C and the aikylation of benzene by "propylene at a temperature of 90°G to 2QO°C, The ratio of alkylatable aromatic •compound;to oiefin used in the instant process will depend upon the degree of .selective, monoalkylation desired as well as the relative; costs of the aromatic and plefinio components of the reaction  mixture.     For alkylation of benzene  by prdpylene, benzene-to-olefin ratios may be as.low as 1 and as high as 10; with a ratio of 2:5-8 being preferred/,;.   Where benzene is':alkyiated with ethylene a ::benzene-toiolefin ratio between;- 1M -and'; 8:1 Js preferred: " For 'detergent ;ra'nge'" olefins of C6-G20; a benzene-to-olefin ratio'of between 5:1-up to--as high as 30;fls: ^generally sufficient, to ensure the: desired monoalkylation selectivity; with; a range1, . between 8:1 and 20:1 even more preferred.,<br>

1        !	-	-<br>
desired selective monoalkylation by reacting the polyafkylates invariably formed<br>
during alkylation with nonalkylated aromatic to form additional monoalkylated precincts. For the purposes of this process, the polyalkylated aromatic compounds<br>
*<br>
are those formed in the alkylation of alkyfatable aromatic compounds with olefins .;as described above,.and the nonalkyiated-aromatic compounds are benzene, .naphthalene,  anthracene,   and  phenanthrene.     The  reaction   conditions  'for i transalkylation are similar to those for alkylation, with temperatures being in the i'ange of 100 to 250°, pressures in the range of 6985 to 3447 kPa (100 to 750 ;psig), and the molar ratio of unalkylated. aromatic to polyalkylated aromatic in the range from 1 to 10.   Examples,of poiyaikylated aromatics which may be reacted with,   e.g.,   benzene .as. the ,nonalkyiated   aromatic   include   diethylbenzene; diisopropylbenzene, dibutylbenzene, triethylbenzene, triisopropylbenzene etc.    v    :; -The .X-ray patterns presented in the following examples (and tables<br>

alculated from the 0 values. This imprecision is general throughout the art and is not sufficient to preclude the differentiation of the present crystalline materials '.from each other and from the compositions of the prior art, In some of the X-ray patterns reported, the relative intensities of the c/-spacings are indicated by the notations vs, s, m and w which represent very strong, strong, medium, and<br>
