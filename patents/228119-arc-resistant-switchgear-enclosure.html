				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to an arc-resistant box for a switching system, in which<br>
there are switching elements, such as a switch, a disconnector, and a plurality of con-<br>
tacts for the switching system, the arc-resistant box comprising a surrounding casing<br>
having a plurality of electrically conductive plate parts and a protective layer for pro-<br>
tecting the arc-resistant box from arcs which occur in the box. Arcs of this type (also<br>
known as sparks or flashovers) may occur as a result of a fault in the switching system,<br>
such as a short circuit. Sparks may develop between voltage-carrying parts of different<br>
potentials or from a voltage-carrying conductor or contact of the switching system to<br>
the conductive box, which is normally at ground potential. These sparks develop a huge<br>
quantity of energy on account of the combination of high voltages and high currents<br>
occurring, and without protective measures, the box of the switching system could be<br>
seriously damaged, possibly with serious consequences for the area surrounding the<br>
box, and in particular people located in its vicinity.<br>
Swiss patent CH 649 872 A5 discloses a protective layer for current- or voltage-carry-<br>
ing parts of electrical installations. The protective layer comprises a material which<br>
comprises synthetic resin, hardener and fillers, the synthetic resin being an endother-<br>
mic, highly reactive, low-viscosity and cold-hardening synthetic resin and the fillers<br>
containing bound water. If a short-circuit arc or spark comes into contact with the layer,<br>
the layer will absorb the heat which has evolved as a result of the material decomposing<br>
and will thereby protect the electrical installation. A layer of this type must be applied<br>
to the inner side of the box and must be completely continuous: even a tiny opening<br>
could be a possible point of attraction for the formation of an arc. Furthermore, a layer<br>
of this type is expensive to apply in a switching system.<br>
Swiss patent CH 598 705 A5 discloses a sandwich panel comprising two layers of con-<br>
ductive material and a fire-retardant layer between them which is used to protect elec-<br>
trical switching installations from the consequences of arcs. If an arc is formed in the<br>
installation and makes contact with the sandwich panel, a hole will be burnt into the<br>
conductive layer. Since there is an insulating layer beneath this conductive layer, the<br><br>
arc is, as it were, pushed away along the conductive plate, with the result that it<br>
is always a new section of the fire-retardant layer which is exposed to the arc<br>
discharge. In this case too, the protective layer has to cover the entire inner side<br>
of the box. Furthermore, a sandwich layer of this type is expensive to produce<br>
and process.<br>
The publication DE-U-72 32 011 discloses a fire protection plate, which protects<br>
against the consequences of an arc inside an enclosure by attracting the art to<br>
the conductive fire protection plate. The composition of the protection plate is<br>
such that the material expands and releases water content to extinguish the arc.<br>
The publication DE-U-89 01 423 describes features of plates inside an enclosure,<br>
which are aimed at protecting against the effects of a fire inside the enclosure,<br>
such as heating of the external surface of the enclosure. Again, a conductive<br>
protection plate is used.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide an arc-resistant box which is<br>
able to withstand the occurrence of arcs caused by faults in a switching system<br>
and protects the area surrounding the box from dangerous situations.<br>
This is achieved by an arc-resistant box of the type described in the preamble in<br>
which at least one of the plurality of plate parts forms a shield toward a region<br>
which is to be protected on the outer side of the box, the protective layer has<br>
insulating properties and the protective layer is only applied to the at least one<br>
plate part.<br><br>
If a protective layer is applied only at a plate part which shields a region which is<br>
to be protected lying outside the box, an arc is not prevented from forming in<br>
the box, but it is ensured that the region which is being shielded is not exposed<br>
to any harmful conditions which may occur should the box be burnt through, for<br>
example a discharge of very hot gases or an explosion.<br>
It has been found that an arc which has formed as a result of a fault in a<br>
switching system generates very large amounts of energy within a very short<br>
time. An arc will generally last for no longer than about one second, after which<br>
external means ensure that the arc is extinguished (for example using external<br>
switches). The pressure inside the box increases exponentially primarily in the<br>
first 0.1 to 0.15 sec (values of 2.5 atm have been measured). Blow-off protection<br>
means which are generally used in boxes for switching systems dissipate the<br>
pressure via a safe route, with the result that in the period which remains the arc<br>
which is present will only cause an excess pressure of approximately 35 mbar.<br>
Nevertheless, on account of the very high temperature (up to 3000°C), this<br>
excess pressure can still lead to serious consequences if the box fails (for<br>
example as a result of a hole being burnt into the conductive plate parts).<br>
In a first embodiment, the protective layer is placed against the outer side of the<br>
box. If<br>
a hole is formed in a plate part which shields a region which is to be protected outside<br>
the box as a result of the action of an arc, a certain time will generally be required for<br>
this hole to form, and this time is usually (depending on the choice and thickness of<br>
material for the box) sufficient to reduce the pressure inside the box to a slight excess<br>
pressure. The protective layer will then retain the hot gases seeking to flow out of the<br>
box as a result of the (slight) excess pressure to a sufficient extent to protect the area.<br>
The protective layer must be electrically insulating in order to prevent the arc from<br>
burning a hole in it. Furthermore, the protective layer is preferably made from a heat-<br>
resistant material, for example a thermosetting material. An example used is a protec-<br>
tive layer made from polyester glass with a thickness of 3 mm which offered sufficient<br>
protection throughout the existence of the arc (one second). If sufficient measures are<br>
taken to prevent softening under the action of moisture, it is even possible for a hard<br>
sheet of cardboard to be used as the protective layer.<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention, the protective layer is applied to the<br>
inner side of the box. If the protective layer bears directly against the at least one plate<br>
part which is shielding the area outside the box which is to be protected, an arc will be<br>
prevented from coming into contact with the plate part in question: it will search for<br>
another conductor or a more conductive part of the box (at ground potential) in order to<br>
find a conductive route. In this case, although a hole may be burnt in another plate part<br>
of the box, this will be directed toward a region where in principle it causes much less<br>
danger or even no danger whatsoever. The material used for the protective layer may be<br>
the same as in the embodiment described above.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the protective layer is designed as a plate which is posi-<br>
tioned a certain distance from the at least one plate part. On the outer side, this still<br>
offers sufficient protection against the discharge of hot gases after the at least one plate<br>
part has been burnt through, since the arc is directed toward areas which do not present<br>
any danger. When positioned on the inner side, it offers the same benefits as the<br>
abovementioned embodiment. However, in this case an additional benefit may arise if<br>
the protective plate is positioned in the box in such a manner (for example virtually<br>
parallel to a side plate of the box, perpendicular to the top side/underside) that separation is effected from air at a different temperature. This results, as it were, in a type of<br><br><br>
stack forming in the box, which has the effect that the air starts to circulate inside the<br>
box. In normal operation, there are a number of what are known as hot spots in the box<br>
with a switching system, where additional heat is generated, for example as a result of<br>
the currents flowing through a conductor or contact. If the air in the box is stationary,<br>
there is poor dissipation of heat to the exterior of the box. In general, it is a requirement<br>
that the components in the box should not become hotter than 65°C or 75°C above the<br>
ambient temperature. Positioning the protective layer in the box at a certain distance<br>
from the at least one plate part, (for example a few centimetres) causes the air inside the<br>
box to circulate, so that the heat is transferred from the hot spots to the circulating air<br>
and, from there, to the box itself, which can then dissipate the heat to the environment.<br>
This results in an additional cooling effect in the box, without having to use a fan or<br>
other moving components, resulting in the temperature being reduced by 5 to 7 degrees.<br>
The present invention will be explained below using a number of exemplary embodi-<br>
ments with reference to the appended drawings, in which:<br>
Fig. 1 shows a simplified cross-sectional view of a switching system according to one<br>
embodiment of the present invention;<br>
Fig. 2 diagrammatically depicts a first embodiment of the present invention;<br>
Fig. 3 diagrammatically depicts a second embodiment of the present invention; and<br>
Fig. 4 diagrammatically depicts a third embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The arc-resistant box according to the present invention can be used in a switching<br>
system as shown in simplified form, in a cross-sectional view in Fig. 1. The switching<br>
system 10 comprises a switch 11, such as a vacuum switch, which is able to connect a<br>
conductor 13 to a further conductor 14. The conductor 13 is operatively connected via a<br>
connection 12 to a power supply line (not shown). The conductor 14 then connects the<br>
switch 11 to one of the connection rails 18 which run perpendicular to the plane of the<br>
drawings. In a standard switching system 10, there is also a disconnector in the con-<br>
ductor 14, but this is of no importance with regard to the explanation of the present<br><br>
invention and has therefore been omitted from the drawing for the sake of clarity. The<br>
switch 11 is actuated by a drive rod 15 with the aid of a drive mechanism 16. The<br>
switching system 10 is also provided with an operating panel 17. The voltage-carrying<br>
parts of the switching system 10 (such as switch 11, conductors 13, 14, connection rails<br>
18) are surrounded by a box which comprises a number of plate parts 19 made from a<br>
conductive material which in normal use is held at ground potential. The drawing<br>
shown in Fig. 1 presents six plate parts 19, but obviously there are also plate parts 19<br>
parallel to the plane of the drawing, so that a completely closed box is formed. In one<br>
or more of the plate parts 19 there may be blow-off holes 21 which, in the event of a<br>
short circuit, discharge any excess pressure by a safe route, in the case illustrated to the<br>
rear side and underside of the switching system 10.<br>
The cross-sectional view shown in Fig. 1 shows one compartment of the switching<br>
system 10. In practice, the switching system 10 comprises a number of compartments<br>
positioned next to one another as shown in Fig. 1, the connection rails 18 running<br>
through each compartment and it being possible for the switching of the conductor 14<br>
to connect any of the connection rails 18 to one of the connection connections 12.<br>
Operation of the switch panel as a whole then takes place at the front of the switching<br>
system 10 via the operating panel 17.<br>
It is possible that a fault may occur in the compartment of the switching system 10 sur-<br>
rounded by plate parts 19, with the result that an arc (electric arc) will be formed<br>
between one of the voltage-carrying parts of the switching system 10 and one of the<br>
plate parts 19 (which is at ground potential). The high voltage difference and the high<br>
current which starts to flow means that this is associated with high levels of energy<br>
being developed inside the box. The arc generally exists for approximately one second,<br>
after which external means switch off the entire switching system 10 and extinguish the<br>
arc. The formation of the arc is associated with a very rapidly rising pressure inside the<br>
box. This pressure is discharged to the outside of the box via a safe route through the<br>
blow off holes 21, with the result that the integrity of the switching system 10 continues<br>
to be ensured. Test measurements have shown that the pressure may rise to as much as<br>
2.5 atm within 0.1 to 0.15 sec. After that, the pressure drops again quickly, but the<br>
presence of the arc means that an excess pressure of approximately 35 mbar will still be<br><br>
present. If the arc exists for long enough, there is a risk of material in the area of the<br>
plate part 19 which the spark meets melting as a result of the very, high temperatures<br>
which are produced, so that ultimately a hole will form in the plate part 19. This will<br>
lead to very hot gases (up to 3000°C) being discharged, which can cause danger to<br>
people in the vicinity of the switching system 10.<br>
The plate part 19 of the box on the right-hand side of the switching system 10 shown in<br>
Fig. 1 shields an area in front of the switching system 10 in which there may be people<br>
and which therefore has to be protected from the possible consequences of a fault<br>
occurring in the switching system 10.<br>
The present invention provides very effective protection of this region by a protective<br>
plate or layer 20 of non-combustible material being arranged on the outer side of the<br>
plate part 19. Obviously, the protective layer 20 must also be electrically insulating, in<br>
order to prevent the possibility of the arc being able to burn a hole at the location where<br>
it is in contact with the protective layer 20.<br>
Since it takes a certain time for the arc to burn a hole through the plate part 19, the<br>
protective layer 20 will only be used as protection when the pressure peak which occurs<br>
as a result of the formation of the arc has dropped again. Therefore, the protective layer<br>
20 only has to be able to retain the hot gases at a slight excess pressure (typically<br>
35 mbar) for the time during which the spark is still existing (less than one second). It<br>
is therefore sufficient to use a heat-resistant insulating material for the protective layer<br>
20. Examples of such materials include thermosetting materials, such as polyester<br>
glass. Tests have shown that a polyester sheet with a thickness of 3 mm offers suffi-<br>
cient protection against possible hot gases which may escape as a result of the arc. If<br>
sufficient protection against softening is provided (dry shielded environment), it is even<br>
possible to use hardboard or hard cardboard sheets as protective layer 20.<br>
Consequently, it is only necessary to fit a protective layer 20 at the locations where the<br>
arc burning through a plate part 19 presents a possible danger (primarily as a result of<br>
the discharge of hot gases). In this way, it is possible to offer sufficient protection<br>
against possible harmful effects of a fault occurring in the switching system 10 in a<br><br>
very inexpensive and simple way.<br>
Figs. 2 to 4 shows a number of alternatives of the present invention. The switching<br>
system 10 is shown in highly simplified form and comprises a box which consists of<br>
conductive plate parts 19, surrounds voltage-carrying parts 5 and is provided with out-<br>
let openings 21. The plate parts 19 are generally held at ground potential. A fault in the<br>
switching system 10, for example a short circuit, may cause an arc 6 to form between<br>
voltage-carrying parts or one of the voltage-carrying parts 5 and one of the plate parts<br>
19.<br>
Fig. 2 shows an embodiment in which a protective layer 20 as described above is<br>
arranged on the outer side of two plate parts 19. This offers protection in the region<br>
outside the box which is shielded by the two plate parts 19 provided with a protective<br>
layer 20.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a further variant in which a protective layer 20 is arranged on the inner<br>
side of a plate part 19. In known solutions the entire inner side of the box is provided<br>
with an insulating layer, so that the voltage-carrying parts 5 in the box do not "see" any<br>
ground potential of the plate parts 19, so that an arc to these plate parts is effectively<br>
prevented from forming. However, this has the drawback that the inner side has to be<br>
very well insulated. Even the smallest hole in the insulating layer will enable an arc to<br>
form. Particularly in the corners of the box, it is very difficult to obtain a continuous<br>
insulating layer. In the embodiment of the invention as shown in Fig. 3, a protective<br>
layer 20 is only arranged on the inner side of a plate part 19 which shields a region out-<br>
side the box where a discharge of hot gases causes danger. In that case, if, following a<br>
fault in the switching system 10, an arc forms, the arc will land on one of the other<br>
plate parts 19. However, the formation of a hole in these plate parts 19 and the subse-<br>
quent discharge of hot gases does not entail any danger in the regions shielded by the<br>
corresponding plate parts 19, since there are no people in these regions.<br>
Yet another alternative of the present invention is shown in Fig. 4. In this case, there<br>
are two protective plates 20 in the box, at a short distance (a few centimetres is enough)<br>
from the plate parts 19 which shield a region outside the box which is to be protected.<br><br>
When a fault occurs in the switching system 10, these protective plates 20 offer suffi-<br>
cient protection to the regions outside the box which shields the associated plate parts<br>
19. In addition, there is a highly advantageous effect during normal operation of the<br>
switching system 10. When the switching system 10 is operating, various parts (in par-<br>
ticular the voltage-carrying parts 5) may be heated very greatly by the high current in-<br>
tensities which occur, resulting in the local formation of what are known as hot spots in<br>
the box. To ensure that all the components (in particular moving components) of the<br>
switching system 10 operate correctly, at the design stage it is assumed that the hot<br>
spots which occur must become no warmer than 65°C or 75°C above the ambient tem-<br>
perature. In a standard switching system 10, this heat is dissipated only by convection<br>
of heat via the stationary air. However, the protective plates 20 in the embodiment<br>
shown in Fig. 4 ensure that a "stack effect" will occur, with the result that the air inside<br>
the box starts to circulate, and the entire outer side of the box (all the plate parts 19) is<br>
effectively used to dissipate heat. To achieve this effect, the protective plates 20 have to<br>
lie substantially parallel to the plate parts 19, as shown, with the result that the hot air is<br>
drawn into the space between the protective layer 20 and plate part 19 of the top side,<br>
since the plate part is cooler at the underside. The protective plates 20 may also be<br>
positioned slightly obliquely with respect to the plate parts 19 in order to make it pos-<br>
sible to achieve the same effect. In a test arrangement, the circulating air was respon-<br>
sible for an additional cooling effect of between 5°C and 7°C. Since no moving ele-<br>
ments are used to circulate the air in the box, the solution shown operates very reliably<br>
and is simple and inexpensive to fit.<br><br>
