2-AMINO-7,8-DIHYDRO-6H-PYRIDO[4,3-D]PYRIMIDIN-5-ONES<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. 119(e) to provisional<br>
applications U.S. Serial No. 60/722,796 filed on September 30, 2005, and U.S. Serial No.<br>
60/836,886 filed on August 9,2006, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its<br>
entirety.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to new 2-amino-7,8-dihydro-6H-pyrido[4,3-.<br>
d]pyrimidin-5-one compounds, their stereoisomers, tautomers, pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salts, and prodrugs thereof; compositions of the new compounds, either alone or in<br>
combination with at least one additional therapeutic agent, with a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier; and uses of the new compounds and compositions, either alone or in<br>
combination with at least one additional therapeutic agent, in the prophylaxis or treatment<br>
of cellular proliferative, viral, autoimmune, cardiovascular, and central nervous system<br>
diseases.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Heat shock or stress dramatically increases cellular production of several classes of<br>
highly conserved chaperone proteins, commonly known as heat-shock proteins (HSPs).<br>
These chaperones, including the members of the HSP60, HSP70, and HSP90 families, are<br>
ATP-dependent molecules that facilitate/ensure proper client protein (e.g. protein that<br>
requires interaction with the chaperones for its activity and stability) folding, prevent non-<br>
specific aggregations, and maintain active protein conformations.<br>
The HSP90 family, comprised of HSP90 α and β, Grp94 and TRAP-1, represents<br>
one of the most abundant cellular proteins, accounting for 1-2% of total protein in a<br>
mammalian cell under normal conditions. HSP90 is unique among cellular chaperones in<br>
that it is not required for general co-translational protein folding but is instead dedicated to a<br>
unique set of cellular proteins, many of which are key signaling molecules critically<br>
-1-<br><br>
WO 2007/041362	PCT/US2006/038181<br>
involved in cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. So far over 100 proteins have been<br>
documented to associate with HSP90 and this list of client proteins is expanding rapidly.<br>
Crystallographic studies have revealed the existence of an unconventional low<br>
affinity ATP binding cleft at their N-terminal domain that is well conserved among the four<br>
HSP90 family members. ATP binding and hydrolysis play an essential role in the<br>
regulation of chaperone functions. The occupancy of the ATP binding site by the<br>
ansamycin antibiotics geldanamycin (GM) and herbimycin A (HA), as well as the<br>
structurally unrelated fungal metabolite radicicol, inhibits the intrinsic ATPase activity of<br>
HSP90 and blocks the ATP/ADP-regulated association-dissociation cycles between HSP90<br>
and client proteins. Consequently, ATP-competitive HSP90 inhibitors induce<br>
destabilization and eventual ubiquitin-dependent degradation of client proteins.<br>
HSP90 has generated tremendous interest as a novel anti-cancer target following the<br>
realization that many of its clients are bona fide oncoproteins that are frequently<br>
overexpressed, mutated, or constitutively active in tumor cells. These include well known<br>
and established cancer drug targets such as receptor tyrosine kinases (HER-2/neu, epidermal<br>
growth factor receptor EGFR, Met and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor IGF-1R),<br>
metastable serine/threonine kinases (Akt and Raf-1), mutated signaling proteins (Flt3, v-<br>
Src), chimeric oncoproteins (Bcr-Abl, NPM-ALK), cell-cycle regulators (CDK4 and<br>
CDK6), transcription factors (estrogen and androgen receptors ER and AR, hypoxia-<br>
inducible factor HIF-icc) and apoptosis regulators (Survivin and Apaf-1). It is notable that<br>
HSP90 client proteins functionally contribute to all of the six "hallmarks of cancer", which<br>
include (with examples of relevant HSP90 client proteins in parenthesis) 1) self-sufficiency<br>
in growth signals (ErbB2, Raf-1), 2) insensitivity to growth suppression signals (Plk, Mytl),<br>
3) evasion of apoptosis (Akt, RIP), 4) acquisition of limitless replicative potential (hTERT),<br>
5) sustained angiogenesis (HIF-lcc, FAK) and 6) invasion and metastasis (Met). The<br>
association with HSP90 ensures that these otherwise unstable oncoproteins function<br>
properly in multiple signaling pathways that are essential in maintaining the unregulated<br>
growth and the malignant phenotypes of tumors.<br>
Inactivation of HSP90 by an ATP-competitive inhibitor will induce simultaneous<br>
depletion of multiple oncoproteins and cause concurrent inhibition of various oncogenic<br>
signaling pathways. Therefore, by disrupting the function of a single molecular entity<br>
-2-<br><br>
WO 2007/041362	PCT/US2006/038181<br>
HSP90, an HSP90 inhibitor may uniquely provide a combinatorial attack on multistep<br>
oncogenesis and block all of the six hallmarks of cancer. Depending on cellular contexts,<br>
HSP90 inhibitors effectively cause growth arrest, differentiation, or apoptosis of tumor cells<br>
both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, HSP90 itself is overexpressed (about 2-20 fold) in<br>
multiple tumor types as a result of oncogenic transformation (e.g. accumulation of mutated<br>
proteins) and cellular stress (e.g. low pH and lack of nutrients). Overexpression of Hsp90<br>
has been shown to correlate with poor prognosis in breast cancer.<br>
Cancer cells are highly adaptive to hostile microenvironments and are capable of<br>
acquiring drag resistance, in part due to their inherent genetic instability and plasticity.<br>
Moreover, most forms of cancer are polygenic and harbor multiple signaling aberrations.<br>
HSP90 may be a key component of the very machinery that allows certain cancer cells to<br>
escape apoptotic death and evoke alternative or overlapping signaling to efficiently develop<br>
resistance to a specific drug treatment. Consequently, inhibition of Hsp90 by concurrently<br>
disrupting a wide range of oncogenic pathways may prove to be a very effective approach to<br>
combat a variety of hard-to-treat tumor.20'23 The cancers include, for example, breast<br>
cancer1, ovarian2, prostate3, chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)4, melanoma5,<br>
gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) , master cell leukemia , testicular tumor , acute<br>
myelogenous leukemia8'9, gastric tumor10, lung11, head and neck12, glioblastoma13, colon14,<br>
thyroid15, stomach, liver, multiple myeloma16, renal17, and lymphoma18'19.<br>
In addition to cancers, Hsp90 inhibitors may also have the potential to treat non-<br>
oncological indications where diseased cells show increased expression and usage of<br>
HSP90. These include, but are not limited to viral diseases mediated by hepatitis B virus<br>
(HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) as well as<br>
autoimmune diseases including those mediated by persistent lymphocyte activation. In all<br>
these cases, elevated Hsp90 activity either facilitates virus assembly and replication or is<br>
required for aberrant signaling transduction in inappropriately activated lymphocyte.<br>
Furthermore, HSP90 inhibitors are also known to induce upregulation of other heat shock<br>
proteins (e.g. HSP70), which may offer neuroprotection and cardioprotection against<br>
ischemic injury as well as damages caused by protein-aggregation. Therefore, HSP90<br>
inhibitors offer therapeutic potential in treatment of central nervous system (CNS) disorders<br>
and cardiovascular diseases.<br>

have a molecular weight between 150 and 750 Daltons, more preferred embodiments have a<br>
molecular weight between 200 and 500 Daltons. Other embodiments of the invention are<br>
compounds with a molecular weight between 300 and 450 Daltons. In another aspect of the<br>
invention compounds of the invention have a molecular weight between 350 and 400<br>
Daltons.<br>
Similarly, it is understood that the above definitions are not intended to include<br>
impermissible substitution patterns (e.g., methyl substituted with 5 fluoro groups). Such<br>
impermissible substitution patterns are well known to the skilled artisan.<br>
"Carboxy-protecting group" refers to a carbonyl group which has been esterified<br>
with one of the commonly used carboxylic acid protecting ester groups employed to block<br>
or protect the carboxylic acid function while reactions involving other functional sites of the<br>
compound are carried out. In addition, a carboxy protecting group can be attached to a solid<br>
support whereby the compound remains connected to the solid support as the carboxylate<br>
until cleaved by hydrolytic methods to release the corresponding free acid. Representative<br>
carboxy-protecting groups include, for example, alkyl esters, secondary amides and the like.<br>
Certain of the compounds of the invention comprise asymmetrically substituted<br>
carbon atoms. Such asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms can result in the compounds<br>
of the invention comprising mixtures of stereoisomers at a particular asymmetrically<br>
substituted carbon atom or a single stereoisomer. As a result, racemic mixtures, mixtures of<br>
enantiomers, as well as enantiomers of the compounds of the invention are included in the<br>
present invention. The terms "S" and "R" configuration, as used herein, are as defined by<br>
the IUPAC 1974 "RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SECTION E, FUNDAMENTAL STEREOCHEMISTRY,"<br>
Pure Appl Chem. 45:13-30,1976. The terms a and P are employed for ring positions of<br>
cyclic compounds. The ct-side of the reference plane is that side on which the preferred<br>
substituent lies at the lower numbered position. Those substituents lying on the opposite<br>
side of the reference plane are assigned p descriptor. It should be noted that this usage<br>
-40-<br><br>
WO 2007/041362	PCT/US2006/038181<br>
differs from that for cyclic stereoparents, in which "a" means "below the plane" and denotes<br>
absolute configuration. The terms a and p configuration, as used herein, are as defined by<br>
the "Chemical Abstracts Index Guide," Appendix IV, paragraph 203,1987.<br>
As used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" refers to the nontoxic<br>
acid or alkaline earth metal salts of the 2-amino-7,8-dihydro-6H-pyrido[4,3-d]pyrimidin-5-<br>
one compounds of the invention. These salts can be prepared in situ during the final<br>
isolation and purification of the 2-amino-7,8-dihydro-6H-pyrido[4,3-d]pyrimidin-5-one<br>
compounds, or by separately reacting the base or acid functions with a suitable organic or<br>
inorganic acid or base, respectively. Representative salts include, but are not limited to, the<br>
following: acetate, adipate, alginate, citrate, aspartate, benzoate, benzenesulfonate,<br>

pivalate, propionate, succinate, sulfate, tartrate, thiocyanate, p-toluenesulfonate, and<br>
undecanoate. Also, tlie basic nitrogen-containing groups can be quaternized with such<br>
agents as alkyl halides, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl chloride, bromides, and<br>
iodides; dialkyl sulfates like dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl, and diamyl sulfates, long chain<br>
halides such as decyl, lauryl, myristyl, and stearyl chlorides, bromides and iodides, aralkyl<br>
halides like benzyl and phenethyl bromides, and others. Water or oil-soluble or dispersible<br>
products are thereby obtained.<br>
Examples of acids that may be employed to form pharmaceutically acceptable acid<br>
addition salts include such inorganic acids as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid and<br>
phosphoric acid and such organic acids as oxalic acid, maleic acid, methanesulfonic acid,<br>
succinic acid and citric acid. Basic addition salts can be prepared in situ during the final<br>
isolation and purification of the 2-amino-7,8-dihydro-6H-pyrido[4,3-d]pyrimidin-5-one<br>
compounds, or separately by reacting carboxylic acid moieties with a suitable base such as<br>
the hydroxide, carbonate or bicarbonate of a pharmaceutically acceptable metal cation or<br>

-42-<br><br>
WO 2007/041362	PCT/US2006/038181<br>
growth of cancer cells. The compounds may be used alone or in compositions together with<br>
a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carriers or excipients include, for example, processing agents and drug delivery modifiers<br>
and enhancers, such as, for example, calcium phosphate, magnesium stearate, talc, .<br>
monosaccharides, disaccharides, starch, gelatin, cellulose, methyl cellulose, sodium<br>
carboxymethyl cellulose, dextrose, hydroxypropyl-p-cyclodextrin, polyvinyl-pyrrolidinone,<br>
low melting waxes, ion exchange resins, and the like, as well as combinations of any two or<br>
more thereof. Other suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients are described in<br>
"Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences," Mack Pub. Co., New Jersey, 1991, incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
Effective amounts of the compounds of the invention generally include any amount<br>
sufficient to detectably inhibit HSP90 activity by any of the assays described herein, by<br>
other HSP90 activity assays known to those having ordinary skill in the art, or by detecting<br>
an inhibition or alleviation of symptoms of cancer.<br>
The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to<br>
produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular<br>
mode of administration. It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any<br>
particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific<br>
compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration,<br>
route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, and the severity of the<br>
particular disease undergoing therapy. The therapeutically effective amount for a given<br>
situation can be readily determined by routine experimentation and is within the skill and<br>
judgment of the ordinary clinician.<br>
For purposes of the present invention, a therapeutically effective dose will generally<br>
be a total daily dose administered to a host in single or divided doses may be in amounts, for<br>
example, of from 0.001 to 1000 mg/kg body weight daily and more preferred from 1.0 to<br>
30 mg/kg body weight daily. Dosage unit compositions may contain such amounts of<br>
submultiples thereof to make up the daily dose.<br>
rhe compounds of the present invention may be administered orally, parenterally,<br>
sublingually, by aerosolization or inhalation spray, rectally, or topically in dosage unit<br>
formulations containing conventional nontoxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers,<br>
-43-<br><br>
WO 2007/041362	PCT/US2006/038181<br>
adjuvants, and vehicles as desired. Topical administration may also involve the use of<br>
transdermal administration such as transdermal patches or ionophoresis devices. The term<br>
parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous injections, intravenous, intramuscular,<br>
intrastemal injection, or infusion techniques.<br>
Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous<br>
suspensions may be formulated according to. the known art using suitable dispersing or<br>
wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a<br>
sterile injectable solution or suspension in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or<br>
solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-propanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and<br>
solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, and isotonic sodium chloride<br>
solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or<br>
suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including<br>
synthetic mono- or di-glycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the<br>
preparation of injectables.<br>
Suppositories for rectal administration of the drug can be prepared by mixing the<br>
drug with a suitable nonirritating excipient such as cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols,<br>
which are solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will<br>
therefore melt in the rectum and release the drug.<br>
Solid dosage forms for oral administration may include capsules, tablets, pills,<br>
powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound may be admixed<br>
with at least one inert diluent such as sucrose lactose or starch. Such dosage forms may also<br>
comprise, as is normal practice, additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g.,<br>
lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate. In the case of capsules, tablets, and pills, the<br>
dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. Tablets and pills can additionally be<br>
prepared with enteric coatings.<br>
Liquid dosage forms for oral administration may include pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups, and elixirs containing inert diluents<br>
commonly used in the art, such as water. Such compositions may also comprise adjuvants,<br>
such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, cyclodextrins, and sweetening,<br>
flavoring, and perfuming agents.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can also be administered in the form of<br>
-44-<br><br>
WO 2007/041362	PCT/US2006/038181<br>
Uposomes. As is known in the art, liposomes are generally derived from phospholipids or<br>
other lipid substances. Liposomes are formed by mono- or multi-lamellar hydrated liquid<br>
crystals that are dispersed in an aqueous medium. Any non-toxic, physiologically<br>
acceptable and metabolizable lipid capable of forming liposomes can be used. The present<br>
compositions in liposome form can contain, in addition to a compound of the present<br>
invention, stabilizers, preservatives, excipients, and the like. The preferred lipids are the<br>
phospholipids and phosphatidyl cholines (lecithins), both natural and synthetic. Methods to<br>
form liposomes are known in the art. See, for example, Prescott (ed.), "Methods in Cell<br>
Biology," Volume XTV, Academic Press, New York, 1976, p. 33 et seq.<br>
While the compounds of the invention can be administered as the sole active<br>
pharmaceutical agent, they can also be used in combination with one or more other agents<br>
used in the treatment of cancer. Representative agents useful in combination with the<br>
compounds of the invention for the treatment of cancer include, for example, irinotecan,<br>
topotecan, gemcitabine, gefitinib, vatalanib, sunitinib, sorafenib, erlotinib, dexrazoxane,<br>
gleevec, herceptin, 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, carboplatin, cisplatin, taxanes, tezacitabine,<br>
cyclophosphamide, vinca alkaloids, imatinib, anthracyclines, rituximab, trastuzumab,<br>
topoisomerase I inhibitors, as well as other cancer chemotherapeutic agents.<br>
The above compounds to be employed in combination with the compounds of the<br>
invention will be used in therapeutic amounts as indicated in the Physicians' Desk Reference<br>
(PDR) 47th Edition (1993), which is incorporated herein by reference, or such<br>
therapeutically useful amounts as would be known to one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
The compounds of the invention and the other anticancer agents can be administered .<br>
at the recommended maximum clinical dosage or at lower doses. Dosage levels of the<br>
active compounds in the compositions of the invention may be varied so as to obtain a<br>
desired therapeutic response depending on the route of administration, severity of the<br>
disease and the response of the patient. The combination can be administered as separate<br>
compositions or as a single dosage form containing both agents. When administered as a<br>
combination, the therapeutic agents can be formulated as separate compositions, which are<br>
given at the same time or different times, or the therapeutic agents, can be given as a single<br>
composition.<br>
Antiestrogens, such as tamoxifen, inhibit breast cancer growth through induction of<br>
-45-<br><br>
WO 2007/041362	PCT/US2006/038181<br>
cell cycle arrest, that requires the action of the cell cycle inhibitor p27Kip. Recently, it has<br>
been shown that activation of the Ras-Raf-MAP Kinase pathway alters the phosphorylation<br>
status of p27Kip such that its inhibitory activity in arresting the cell cycle is attenuated,<br>
thereby contributing to antiestrogen resistance (Donovan, et al, J. Biol. Chem. 276:40888,<br>
2001). As reported by Donovan et al., inhibition of MAPK signaling through treatment<br>
with MEK inhibitor changed the phosphorylation status of p27 in hormone refactory breast<br>
cancer cell lines and in so doing restored hormone sensitivity. Accordingly, in one aspect,<br>
the compounds of formula (I), (la), (II), (Ha), (III), (Ilia), (TV), (IVa), (V), or (Va) may be<br>
used in the treatment of hormone dependent cancers, such as breast and prostate cancers, to<br>
reverse hormone resistance commonly seen in these cancers with conventional anticancer<br>
agents.<br>
In hematological cancers, such as chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML),<br>
chromosomal translocation is responsible for the constitutively activated BCR-ABL<br>
tyrosine kinase. The afflicted patients are responsive to gleevec, a small molecule tyrosine<br>
kinase inhibitor, as a result of inhibition of Abl kinase activity. However, many patients<br>
with advanced stage disease respond to gleevec initially, but then relapse later due to<br>
resistance-conferring mutations in the Abl kinase domain. In vitro studies have<br>
demonstrated that BCR-Avl employs the Raf kinase pathway to elicit its effects. In<br>
addition, inhibiting more than one kinase in the same pathway provides additional<br>
protection against resistance-conferring mutations. Accordingly, in another aspect of the<br>
invention, the compounds of formula (I), (la), (II), (Ila), (III), (Ilia), (IV), (IVa), (V), or<br>
(Va) are used in combination with at least one additional agent, such as gleevec, in the<br>
treatment of hematological cancers, such as chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), to<br>
reverse or prevent resistance to the at least one additional agent.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, kits that include one or more compounds of the<br>
invention are provided. Representative kits include a 2-amino-7,8-dihydro-6H-pyrido[4,3-<br>
d]pyrimidin-5-one compound of the invention (e.g., a compound of formula (I), (la), (II),<br>
(Ila), (III), (Ilia), (IV), (IVa), (V), or (Va)) and a package insert or other labeling including<br>
directions for treating a cellular proliferative disease by administering an HSP90 inhibitory<br>
amount of the compound.<br>

Example 9.<br>
In one aspect, certain compounds of the invention having a substituted 7-phenyl<br>
moiety can be prepared as shown in Scheme 1. Benzyl amine 1-C, prepared from cbiral<br>
amine 1-A by reductive amination, and cinnamate 1-D, prepared from a Wadsworth<br>
Emmons homologation of aldehyde 1-B, are coupled to give the conjugate addition product<br>
1-E (Steven D. Bull, Stephen G. Davies, Santiago Delgado-Ballester, Peter M. Kelly, Luke<br>
J. Kotchie, Massimo Gianotti, Mario Laderas and Andrew D. Smith, J. Chem. Soc, Perkin<br>
Trans. 1,2001, (23), 3112). Removal of the benzyl group is accomplished using 1.1 eq. of<br>
cerric ammonium nitrate in acetonitrile and water. Resulting amine 1-F is acylated with<br>
methyl malonyl chloride 1-G to give compound 1-H. Cyclization is effected via a<br>
Dieckmann condensation upon treatment with base such as sodium ethoxide. The resulting<br>
lactam is then treated with acid such as HC1 to effect decarboxylation and afford compound<br>
1-1. O-acylation with acetyl chloride and treatment with catalytic dunethylaminopyridine in<br>
boiling solvent such as acetonitrile or toluene to effect migration of the acetate group gives<br>
compound I-J. Pyrimidine I-K is formed by treating I-J with guanidine/EtOH and<br>
dimethylamine. The para-methoxybenzyl group can be removed at this stage (or after the<br>
Suzuki coupling) with cerric ammonium nitrate or trifluoroacetic acid. The phenyl ring of<br>
I-K can optionally be functionalized via a Suzuki coupling with a suitable boronic acid to<br>
give the biaryl compound I-L. Subsequent deprotection of thepara-methoxybenzyl group<br>
gives amine I-M.<br>

WO 2007/041362	PCT/US2006/038181<br><br>
In another aspect, certain compounds of the invention can be prepared as shown in<br>
Scheme 2. Condensation of an appropriate amine such as methyl amine with oxalic acid<br>
and a desired aldehyde such as 2-A in refluxing ethanol results in formation of acid 2-B,<br>
that is next converted to the corresponding ester 2-C under esterification conditions such as<br>
with thionyl chloride in an appropriate alcoholic solvent at 0 °C. Formation of acetoamide<br>
2-E is accomplished by treatment of the 2-C ester with diketene 2-D. Subsequent<br>
cyclization of 2-D in the presence of base such as sodium methoxide and with microwave<br>
heating produces lactam 2-F. Aminopyridine formation is accomplished in two steps, the<br>
first being formation of an intermediate enamine by heating the lactam in an ethanolic<br>
solution of pyrrolidine under microwave conditions and secondly, addition of guanidine-<br>
HC1 to this solution followed by additional microwave heating. Isolation of the<br>
aminopyrimidine 2-G by reverse phase HPLC followed by coupling with an appropriate<br>
-48-<br><br>
WO 2007/041362	PCT/US2006/038181<br>
arylboromc acid under Suzuki conditions and microwave heating gives the biaryl compound<br>
2-H.<br><br>
Scheme 3 shows another means for synthesizing certain compounds of the<br>
invention. Reductive amination of p-anisole 3-A with (S)-l-(4-methoxyphenyl)ethanamine<br>
3-B and sodium borohydride over molecular sieves gives amine 3-C. Subsequent formation<br>
of the amine anion such as by reacting 3-C with n-butyl lithium and treatment with the<br>
appropriate cinnamate ester 3-D gives the conjugate addition product 3-E. Deprotection<br>
with trifluoroacetic acid gives amine 3-F that can be converted to 3-1 following the steps<br>
shown in the Scheme 2 and described above.<br>

In another embodiment, provided is a use of compound of formula (VI) or (VII) for<br>
the manufacture of a compound of formula (I).<br>
The present invention will be understood more readily by reference to the following<br>
examples, which are provided by way of illustration and are not intended to be limiting of<br>
the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Referring to the examples that follow, compounds of the present invention were<br>
synthesized using the methods described herein, or other methods, which are well known in<br>
the art.<br>
The compounds and/or intermediates were characterized by high performance liquid<br>
chromatography (HPLC) using a Waters Millenium chromatography system with a<br>
2690 Separation Module (Milford, MA). The analytical columns were Alltima C-18<br>
reversed phase, 4.6 x 250 mm from Alltech (Deerfield, IL). A gradient elution was used,<br>
typically starting with 5% acetonitrile/95% water and progressing to 100% acetonitrile over<br>
a period of 40 minutes. All solvents contained 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA).<br>
Compounds were detected by ultraviolet light (UV) absorption at either 220 or 254 run.<br>
HPLC solvents were from Burdick and Jackson (Muskegan, MI), or Fisher Scientific<br>
-53-<br><br>
WO 2007/041362	PCT/US2006/038181<br>
(Pittsburgh, PA). In some instances, purity was assessed by thin layer chromatography<br>
(TLC) using glass or plastic backed silica gel plates, such as, for example, Baker-Flex Silica<br>
Gel 1B2-F flexible sheets. TLC results were readily detected visually under ultraviolet<br>
light, or by employing well known iodine vapor and other various staining techniques.<br>
Mass spectrometric analysis was performed on one of two LC/MS instruments: a<br>
Waters System (Alliance HT HPLC and a Micromass ZQ mass spectrometer; Column:<br>
Eclipse XDB-C18,2.1 x 50 mm; solvent system: 5-95% (or 35-95%, or 65-95% or 95-95%)<br>
acetonitrile in water with 0.05%TFA; flow rate 0.8 rnL/min; molecular weight range<br>
500-1500; cone Voltage 20 V; column temperature 40°C) or a Hewlett Packard System<br>
(Series 1100 HPLC; Column: Eclipse XDB-C18, 2.1 x 50 mm; solvent system: 1-95%<br>
acetonitrile in water with 0.05%TFA; flow rate 0.4 mL/min; molecular weight range<br>
150-850; cone Voltage 50 V; column temperature 30°C). All masses were reported as those<br>
of the protonated parent ions.<br>
GCMS analysis is performed on a Hewlett Packard instrument (HP6890 Series gas<br>
chromatograph with a Mass Selective Detector 5973; injector volume: 1 yL; initial column<br>
temperature: 50 °C; final column temperature: 250 °C; ramp time: 20 minutes; gas flow<br>
rate: 1 mL/min; column: 5% phenyl methyl siloxane, Model No. HP 190915-443,<br>
dimensions: 30.0 m x 25 m x 0.25 m).<br>
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis was performed on some of the<br>
compounds with a Varian 300 MHz NMR (Palo Alto, CA). The spectral reference was<br>
either TMS or the known chemical shift of the solvent. Some compound samples were run<br>
at elevated temperatures (e.g., 75°C) to promote increased sample solubility.<br>
The purity of some of the invention compounds is assessed by elemental analysis<br>
(Desert Analytics, Tucson, AZ)<br>
Melting points are determined on a Laboratory Devices Mel-Temp apparatus<br>
(Holliston, MA).<br>
Preparative separations were carried out using a Flash 40 chromatography system<br>
and KP-Sil, 60A (Biotage, Charlottesville, VA), or by flash column chromatography using<br>
silica gel (230-400 mesh) packing material, or by HPLC using a C-18 reversed phase<br>
column. Typical solvents employed for the Flash 40 Biotage system and flash column<br>

Using the procedure described in Example 10, certain compounds in Tables 1-5<br>
were shown to have HSP90 inhibitory activity at an IC50 of less than 25 ^M. Some of the<br>
compounds have an IC50 of less than about 10 uM.<br>
EXAMPLE 10<br>
HSP90 INHIBITOR BINDING POTENCY: TRF BINDING ASSAY<br>
In this example, the binding potency of HSP90 inhibitors as measured by a TRF<br>
binding assay is described.<br>
TRF competition binding assays were performed to determine the binding potency<br>
(IC50 values) of HSP90 inhibitors. Purified His-tagged N-terminal ATP binding domain<br>
(amino acid residues 9-236) of HSP90a (HSP90a GenelD: 3320; mRNA Sequence<br>
NM_005348) was incubated for two hours at room temperature in binding buffer (50 mM<br>
HEPES, 6 mM MgCl2, 20 mM KC1 and 0.1% BSA) with biotinylated radicicol and<br>
progressively higher concentrations of the competing compounds. A fraction of the mixture<br>
was transferred to capture plates (coated with streptavidin) and incubated for one hour at<br>
room temperature. After washing with DELFIA wash buffer, europium-labeled anti-his<br>
antibody was added and incubated for two hours at room temperature, followed by washing<br>
with DELFIA buffer. DELFIA enhancement solution was then added. After gentle shaking<br>
for 10 minutes, the plates were read in VICTOR for europium counts.<br>
