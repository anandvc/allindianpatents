				<td>TITLE<br>
Lubricating Composition Containing a Polymer<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention provides a lubricating composition containing an oil of<br>
lubricating viscosity, and an additive containing a polymeric backbone and at<br>
least one amino group.  The invention further provides for the additive to have<br>
dispersant and/or dispersant viscosity modifying properties.   The lubricating<br>
composition is suitable for lubricating an internal combustion engine.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0001] Engine manufacturers have focused on improving engine design in order to minimise emissions of particulate emissions, emissions of other pollutants, cleanliness and also improve fuel economy and efficiency. One of the improvements in engine design is the use of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) engines. Whilst improvements in engine design and operation have contributed, improved formulation of engine oil lubricants may also increase cleanliness and minimise engine deposits which accumulate when the engines are running. However, a number of engine design enhancements have led to increased formation and/or accumulation of soot and sludge. [0002] Increased soot thickening is common in heavy duty diesel engines. Some diesel engines employ EGR. The soot formed in an EGR engine has different structures and causes increased viscosity of engine lubricant at lower soots levels than formation of soot in the engine without an EGR. Attempts to alleviate soot formation are disclosed in the references summarised below. [0003] Traditional dispersant viscosity modifiers (DVMs) made from ethylene-propylene copolymers that have been radically grafted with maleic anhydride and reacted with various amines have shown desirable performance to prevent oil thickening in diesel engines. Aromatic amices axe said to show good performance in this regard. DVMs of this type are disclosed in, for instance, U.S. Patents 4,863,623; 6,107,257; 6,107,258; and 6,117,825.<br>
[0004]      U.S. Patent US 4,863,623 discloses controlling EGR soot by utilising<br>
maleic anhydride grafted ethylene-propylene copolymers capped with aromatic<br>
amines, such as 4-aminodiphenylamine.<br>
[0005]      U.S. Patent 5,409,623 discloses functionalised graft copolymers as<br>
viscosity index improvers, containing an ethylene alpha-monoolefin copolymer<br>
grafted   with   an   ethylenically   unsaturated   carboxylic   acid   material   and<br>
derivatised with an azo-containing aromatic amine compound.<br>
[0006]      U.S.  Patent  5,356,999  discloses  multifunctional  viscosity  index<br>
improvers for lubricating oils containing a polymer onto which has been grafted<br>
an unsaturated reactive monomer and thereafter reacted with amines containing<br>
sulphonamide units. The polymer is either an ethylene-propylene copolymer or<br>
an ethylene-propylene-diene terpolymer.<br>
[0007]      U.S.   Patent   5,264,140   discloses   an   ethylene   alpha-monoolefin<br>
copolymer grafted with an ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid derivatised<br>
with an amide-containing aromatic amine material.<br>
[0008]      International publication WO 06/015130 discloses maleic anhydride<br>
grafted     ethylene-propylene     copolymers     capped    with     sulphonamides,<br>
nitroanilines, diaromatic diazocompounds, anilides or phenoxyanilides.    The<br>
copolymers are useful for controlling EGR soot.<br>
[0009]      Other dispersant viscosity modifying polymers suitable for lubricants<br>
have  been  contemplated  including  polyacrylic   copolymers,   including  the<br>
disclosure of British Patent GB 768 701.<br>
[0010]      US Patent 4,234,435 discloses a composition in which a succinated<br>
polybutene is condensed with either an alkyl polyamine to make a succinimide<br>
dispersant or an alkyl polyol to make a succinic ester dispersant.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0011] The inventors of the present invention have discovered that providing at least one of (i) a lubricating composition capable of reducing viscosity increase (often less than 12 mm /sec (cSt) at 100 °C si a soot loading of 6 weight % or more), and/or (ii) a lubricating oil composition maintain a relatively stable viscosity over a wide range of temperatures could be desirable because viscosity index improvers or DVMs may be employed to control<br>
viscosity over a wide temperature range and to control soot. Accordingly, it may also be desirable if a viscosity index improver were capable of achieving (i) and (ii).<br>
[0012] The inventors of this invention have discovered that the lubricating composition is capable of providing at least one of (i) dispersancy, (ii) cleanliness and (iii) providing a lubricant with acceptable levels of soot thickening and/or sludge formation. Accordingly, it may also be desirable if an additive were capable for providing dispersant properties, and optionally providing a lubricant with acceptable levels of soot thickening and/or sludge formation.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0025]      The present invention provides a lubricating composition and a method for lubricating an engine as disclosed above.<br>
[0026] As used herein, the term "hydrocarbyl substituent" or "hydrocarbyl group" is used in its ordinary sense, which is well-known to those skilled in the art. Specifically, it refers to a group having a carbon atom directly attached to the remainder of the molecule and having predominantly hydrocarbon character. Examples of hydrocarbyl groups include:<br>
(i) hydrocarbon substituents, that is, aliphatic (e.g., alkyl or alkenyl), alicyclic (e.g., cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl) substituents, and aromatic-, aliphatic-, and alicyclic-substituted aromatic substituents, as well as cyclic substituents wherein the ring is completed through another portion of the molecule (e.g., two substituents together form a ring);<br>
(ii) substituted hydrocarbon substituents, that is, substituents containing non-hydrocarbon groups which, in the context of this invention, do not alter the predominantly hydrocarbon nature of the substituent (e.g., halo (especially chloro and fluoro), hydroxy, alkoxy, mercapto, alkylmercapto, nitro, nitroso, and sulphoxy);<br>
(iii) hetero substituents, that is, substituents which, while having a predominantly hydrocarbon character, in the context of this invention, contain other than carbon in a ring or chain otherwise composed of carbon atoms; and<br>
(iv) heteroatoms include sulphur, oxygen, nitrogen, and encompass substituents as pyridyl, furyl, thienyl and imidazolyl. In general, no more than two, preferably no more than one, non-hydrocarbon substituent will be present for every ten carbon atoms in the hydrocarbyl group; typically, there will be no non-hydrocarbon substituents in the hydrocarbyl group. Compound of Formulae (1). (la) and (lb)<br>
[0027] The polymer backbone may be a homopolymer or a copolymer, provided that it contains at least one carboxylic acid functionality or a reactive equivalent of carboxylic acid functionality (e.g., anhydride or ester). The carboxylic acid functionality or a reactive equivalent of carboxylic acid functionality is defined within Formula (1) as Q. The polymer backbone may have the carboxylic acid functionality (or a reactive equivalent of carboxyiic acid functionality) grafted onto the backbone, within the polymer backbone or as a terminal group on the polymer backbone.<br>
[0028] In Formula (1) the BB-Q- unit may be derivable from, for instance, polyisobutylene succinic anhydride, maleic anhydride-styrene copolymers, esters of maleic anhydride-styrene copolymers, (alpha-olefin maleic anhydride) copolymers; maleic anhydride-grafted styrene-ethylene-alpha olefin polymers; polymethacrylates; polyacrylates; polyhydroxycarboxylic acids (including polyhydroxystearic acid); maleic anhydride graft copolymers of (i) hydrogenated alkenyl aryl conjugated diene copolymers (in particular hydrogenated copolymers of styrene-butadiene), (ii) polyolefins grafted with maleic anhydride (in particular ethylene-propylene copolymers), or (iii) hydrogenated isoprene polymers (in particular hydrogenated styrene-isoprene polymers); or mixtures thereof.<br>
[0029] Examples of a suitable polymeric backbone to represent BB of Formula (1) include polymethacrylates or polyacrylates, polyisobutylenes, hydrogenated copolymers of styrene-butadiene, isobutylene-isoprene copolymers, ethylene alpha-monoolefin copolymers such as ethylene-propylene copolymers, polyisobutenes, hydrogenated styrene-isoprene polymers, hydrogenated isoprene polymers, hydrogenated alkenyl aryl conjugated diene copolymers, polyolefins, maleic anhydride-styrene copolymers (or esters of maleic anhydride-styrene copolymers thereof), or (alpha-olefin maleic anhydride) copolymers, or mixtures thereof. In one embodiment BB-Q- is derived from a polyisobutylene succinic anhydride, or mixtures thereof. [0030] For polymethacrylates or polyacrylates, the carboxylic acid group is defined within Q of Formula (1).<br>
[0031] For copolymers containing the maleic anhydride units within the backbone of the polymer (often referred to as interpolymers or alternating copolymers) e.g., maleic anhydride-styrene copolymers, or (alpha-olefin maleic anhydride) copolymers, the maleic anhydride unit is defined within Q of Formula (1).<br>
[0032] The polymer backbones described herein are known in lubricant technology. For example:<br>
(i)       maleic anhydride and styrene-containing polymers are known from U.S. Patent 6,544,935;<br>
(ii)      styrene-ethylene-alpha olefin polymers are taught in International<br>
publication WO 01/30947; (iii)     copolymers derived from isobutylene and isoprene have been used in preparing dispersants and are reported in International publication WO 01/98387; (iv)     styrene-butadiene and styrene-isoprene copolymers are described in a number of references including DE 3,106,959;  and US Patents 5,512,192, and 5,429,758; (v)      polyisobutylene  succinic  anhydrides  have  been  described  in numerous  publications  including  US   Patents  4,234,435;   and 3,172,892; (vi)     ethylene-propylene   copolymers   have   been   described   in   US<br>
Patents 4,632,769; 4,517,104; and 4,780,228; (vii)    (alpha-olefin maleic anhydride) copolymers have been described<br>
in US Patent 5,670,462; (viii)   polymethacrylates and polyacrylates are described in Neudoerfl, P.,  5th International Colloquim,  additives for Lubricants and Operational Fluids, Volume 11, sections 8.2-1 to 8,2-15; and (ix)     polyhydroxycarboxylic acids have been described in European Patent Application 1 752 516. [0033]      Many of the polymer backbones are also described in "Chemistry and Technology of Lubricants, Second Edition, Edited by R.M. Mortier and S. T. Orszulik Published by Blackie Academic &amp; Professional. In particular pages 144-180 discuss many of the polymer backbones (i)-(iv) and (vi)-(ix).   The chemistry of (v) is described in more detail in pages 86 to 90. [0034]      The polymer backbone (other than a polyisobutylene) of the present invention may have a number average molecular weight (by gel permeation chromatography, polystyrene standard), which may be up to 150,000 or higher, e.g., 1,000 or 5,000 to 150,000 or to 120,000 or to 100,000.  An example of a suitable number average molecular weight range includes 10,000 to DU,00\), or 10,000 to 15,000, or 30,000 to 50,000.    In one embodiment, the polymer backbone has a number average molecular weight of greater than 5,000, for<br>
instance, greater than 5000 to 150,000. Other combinations of the above-identified molecular weight limitations are also contemplated. [0035] When the polymer backbone of the invention is a polyisobutylene number average molecular weight (by gel permeation chromatography, polystyrene standard), may be 350 to 5000, or 550 to 3000 or 750 to 2500. Commercially available polyisobutylene polymers have a number average molecular weight of 550, 750, 950-1000, 1650, or 2250.<br>
[0036] In one embodiment A is an aromatic group containing 1 to 6, or 1 to 4, or 1-2, or just 1 six-membered ring. When A is a six-membered ring, the ring is either a substituted phenyl (represented by Formula la) or a phenyl (represented by Formula (lb). In one embodiment A is phenyl. [0037] Formulae (1) and (la) may contain a group represented by E. The definition of E includes a halogen such as chlorine, bromine, iodine or fluorine. Typically, when E is a halogen, E is chlorine. In one embodiment E is not a halogen.<br>
[0038] Other suitable groups within the definition of E include a nitro group, a carboxylic acid or ester, a sulphamide group, an amido group, or a hydrocarbyl group. The hydrocarbyl group typically includes C1-4-alkyl or optionally substituted aromatic groups. The optionally substituted aromatic groups typically include benzyl, phenyl or naphthyl.<br>
[0039] When m is zero, the aromatic ring is unsubstituted, and E is replaced by hydrogen to satisfy the valence of the aromatic carbon atoms. Formula (lb) represents an additive when E is replaced by hydrogen to satisfy the valence of the aromatic carbon atoms.<br>
[0040] The group -Q-G-Z-, may be derivable from an anthranilic anhydride, or a substituted anthranilic anhydride (when m is not zero in formula (1)). An example of a suitable anthranilic anhydride is isatoic anhydride, 8-methyl isatoic anhydride, 8-ethyl isatoic anhydride, 8-propyl isatoic anhydride, 8-butyl isatoic anhydride, naphthylanthranilic anhydride, ox mixtures thereof. In one embodiment Formula (la) and Formula (lb) represent an additive derived from isatoic anhydride.<br>
[0041] The compound of Formula (1) typically has the number of groups within [ ]u is in the range of 1 to 2000, or 1 to 500, or 5 to 250, or 1 to 4. [0042] In one embodiment the number of groups within [ ]u is in the range of 1 to 5, and the polymeric backbone (BB) is a polyisobutylene. [0043] In one embodiment the number of groups within [ ]u is in the range of 5 to 250, and the polymeric backbone includes maleic anhydride-styrene copolymers, esters of maleic anhydride-styrene copolymers, (alpha-olefin maleic anhydride) copolymers; polymethacrylates; polyacrylates; polyhydroxycarboxylic acids; maleic anhydride graft copolymers of (i) hydrogenated alkenyl aryl conjugated diene copolymers, (ii) polyolefins grafted with maleic anhydride, or (iii) hydrogenated isoprene polymers; or mixtures thereof.<br>
[0044] In one embodiment the number of groups within [ ]u is in the range of 5 to 250, and the polymeric backbone includes polyolefins grafted with maleic anhydride, or mixtures thereof. The polyolefin may be an ethylene-propylene copolymer.<br>
[0045] When k is equal to zero the hydrocarbyl group typically contains an aryl group and at least one heteroatom. The heteroatom may be nitrogen, sulphur, oxygen, or mixtures thereof. In one embodiment the heteroatom is nitrogen.<br>
[0046] Z may be derivable from (i) an amine, wherein the amine contains a primary or secondary amino-group, (ii) an alcohol, (iii) an aminoalcohol, and (iv) a thiol, or (v) mixtures thereof. In one embodiment Z is derivable from an amine.<br>
[0047] The amine may be a monoamine or a polyamine. The amine may be an aromatic amine or non-aromatic.<br>
[0048] Examples of suitable polyamines include ethylenediamine, 1,2-diaminopropane, N-methylethylenediamine, N-tallow(C16-C18)-l,3-propylene-diamine, N-oleyl-l,3-propylenediamine, polyethylenepolyamines (such as diethylenetriamine, triethylenetetramine, tetraethylenepentamine ana "polyamine bottoms" (or "alkylenepolyamine bottoms")).  In one embodiment<br>
the polyamine includes polyalkylenepolyamines. An additive of Formula (1) derived from one of the polyamines is believed to have dispersant properties. [0049] In general, alkylenepolyamine bottoms may be characterised as having less than two, usually less than 1% (by weight) material boiling below about 200°C. A typical sample of such ethylene polyamine bottoms obtained from the Dow Chemical Company of Freeport, Texas designated "HPA-X™", or from Huntsman as "E-100™". These alkylenepolyamine bottoms may be prepared using an ethylene dichloride process.<br>
[0050] The aromatic amine may be an amine having two linked aromatic moieties. By the term "aromatic moiety is meant to include both mononuclear and polynuclear groups. The aromatic amine will typically have an N-H group capable of condensing with the pendant carbonyl containing group derivable from Z.<br>
[0051] The polynuclear groups may be of the fused type wherein an aromatic nucleus is fused at two points to another nucleus such as found in naphthyl or anthranyl groups. The polynuclear group may also be of the linked type wherein at least two nuclei (either mononuclear or polynuclear) are linked through bridging linkages to each other. These bridging linkages may be chosen from, among others known to those skilled in the art, alkylene linkages, ether linkages, ester linkages, keto linkages, sulphide linkages, polysulphide linkages of 2 to 6 sulphur atoms, sulphone linkages, sulphonamide linkages, amide linkages, azo linkages, and direct carbon-carbon linkages between the groups without any intervening atoms. Other aromatic groups include those with heteroatoms, such as pyridine, pyrazine, pyrimidine, and thiophene. Examples of the aromatic groups that are useful herein include the aromatic groups derived from benzene, naphthalene, and anthracene, preferably benzene. Each of these various aromatic groups may also be substituted by various substituents, including hydrocarbyl substituents.<br>
[0052] The aromatic amine may, in general, contain one or more reactive (condensable) amino groups. A single reactive amino group is sometimes preferred. Multiple amino groups, as in the case of the above described N,N-dimethylphenylenediamines, may be useful as well, especially if they are<br>
reacted under relatively mild conditions so as to avoid excessive crosslinking or gellation of the additive.<br>
[0053] In one embodiment the aromatic amine is derived from dye intermediates containing multiple aromatic rings linked by, for example, amide structures. Examples include materials of the general structure:<br>
(Structure Removed)<br>
RN and isomeric variations thereof, where R1 and R11 are independently alkyl or<br>
alkoxy groups such as methyl, methoxy, or ethoxy.  In one instance, R1 and R11<br>
are both -OCH3 and the material is known as Fast Blue RR [CAS# 6268-05-9].<br>
The orientation of the linking amido group may be reversed, to -NR-C(O)- .<br>
[0054]      In another instance, R11 is -OCH3 and R1 is -CH3, and the material is<br>
known as Fast Violet B [99-21-8].    When both Ri and Rii are ethoxy, the<br>
material is Fast Blue BB [120-00-3].   U.S. Patent 5,744,429 discloses other<br>
aromatic   amine   compounds,   particularly   aminoalkylphenothiazines.      N-<br>
aromatic substituted acid amide compounds, such as those disclosed in U.S.<br>
Patent Application 2003/0030033 A1, may also be used for the purposes of this<br>
invention.  Suitable aromatic amines include those in which the amine nitrogen<br>
is a substituent on an aromatic carbocyclic compound, that is, the nitrogen is<br>
not sp hybridized within an aromatic ring.<br>
[0055]      In one embodiment the aromatic amine may be an amine having two<br>
aromatic moieties linked by an -O- group.   An example of such an amine is<br>
phenoxyphenylamine, also known as phenoxyaniline or aminophenyl phenyl<br>
ether, which may be represented by:<br>
and its various positional isomers (4-phenoxy, 3-phenoxy, and 2-phenoxy-aniline). Either or both of the aromatic groups may bear substituents, including hydrocarbyl,  amino, halo,  sulphoxy,  hydroxy,  nitro,  carboxy,  and alkoxy<br>
substituents. The amine nitrogen may be a primary amine nitrogen, as shown, or it may be secondary, that is, bearing a further substituent such as hydrocarbyl, preferably short chain alkyl such as methyl. In one embodiment, the aromatic amine is the unsubstituted material shown above. [0056] The aromatic amine may be an amine having two aromatic moieties linked by an -N=N- group, an azo group. Such a material may be represented by the formula:<br>
<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein each X is independently N or CH and the R groups are hydrogen or substituents as described above for the phenoxyphenylamine. Thus, each or Riii and R1V may be independently be H, -NH2, hydrocarbyl or alkyl such as -CH3, halo such as -Cl, sulphoxy such as -SO3H, or -SO3Na; and each of Rv, RV1, and RV1 is independently H, -OH, -NO2, -SO3H, carboxy such as -CO2Na, or alkoxy such as -OC4H9. These materials are described in greater detail in U.S. Patent 5,409,623, see column 4.<br>
[0057] In one embodiment the azo-linked aromatic amine is represented by the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
that is, 4-(4-nitrophenylazo)aniline, as well as positional isomers thereof.  The<br>
material shown is commercially available as a dye known as Disperse Orange<br>

[0058]       In one embodiment aromatic amine may be an amine having two<br>
aromatic moieties linked by a -C(0)0- group.  Each group may be substituted<br>
as described above for the oxygen-linked and the azo-linked amines.   In one<br>
embodiment this amine is represented by the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
HO as well as positional isomers thereof.   The material shown is phenyl-4-amino salicylate   or   4-amino-2-hydroxy   benzoic   acid   phenyl   ester,   which   is commercially available.<br>
[0059]      In one embodiment the aromatic amine may be a diamine represented by the N,N-dialkylphenylenediamine formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R1X and Rx may independently be hydrogen or a hydrocarbyl group<br>
(typically containing 1 to 6 carbon atoms).<br>
[0060]      An example of a particularly useful compound defines both RIX and<br>
Rx as hydrogen (N,N-dimethyl-l,4-phenylenediamine).<br>
[0061]      In one embodiment the aromatic amine may be an amine having two<br>
aromatic moieties linked by an -SO2- group.   Each of the aromatic moieties<br>
may be substituted as described above for the oxygen-linked and the azo-linked<br>
amines.  In one embodiment the linkage, in addition to -SO2-, further contains<br>
an -NR- or specifically an -NH- group, so that the entire linkage is -SO2NR-<br>
or -SO2NH-. In one embodiment, this aromatic amine is represented by the<br>
formula:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
[0062] The structure as shown is that of 4-amino-N-phenyl-benzenesulphonamide. A commercially available variation thereof is sulphamethazine, or N'-(4,6-dimethyl-2-pyrimidinyl)sulphanilamide (CAS Number 57-68-1) which is believed to be represented by the formula:<br>
[0063]      Sulphamethazine is commercially available.<br>
[0064]      The aromatic amine may be a nitro-substituted aniline, which, can,<br>
likewise, bear the substituents as described above for the oxygen-linked and the<br>
azo-linked amines. Included are the ortho-, meta-, and para- substituted isomers<br>
of nitroaniline. In one embodiment the amine is 3-nitro-aniline.<br>
[0065]      Examples   of   other   suitable   aromatic   amines   include   amino-<br>
substituted aromatic compounds and amines in which the amine nitrogen is a<br>
part of an aromatic ring, such as 3-aminoquinoline, 5-aminoquinoline, and<br>
8-aminoquinoline.	Also    included    are    aromatic    amines    such    as<br>
2-aminobenzimidazole, which contains one secondary amino group attached<br>
directly to the aromatic ring and a primary amino group attached to the<br>
imidazole ring.  Other amines include N-(4-anilinophenyl)-3-aminobutanamide<br>
or 3-amino propyl imidazole, or 2,5-dimethoxybenzylamine.<br>
[0066]      The aromatic amine may also be an aminoquinoline.   Commercially<br>
available       materials       include       3-aminoquinoline,       5-aminoquinoline,<br>
6-aminoquinoline,     and     8-aminoquinoline     and     homologues     such     as<br>
4-aminoquinaldine.<br>
[0067]      The aromatic amine may also be an aminobenzimidazole such as 2-<br>
aminobenzimidazole.<br>
[0068]      The aromatic amine may also be a ring-substituted benzylamine,<br>
with various substituents as described above.   One such benzyl amine is 2,5-<br>
dimethyoxybenzylamine.<br>
[0069]      Examples of particularly useful aromatic amines include aniline, N-<br>
alkylanilines    such    as    N-methylaniline    and    N-butylaniline,    di-(para-<br>
methylphenyl)amine, 4-aminodiphenylamine, N,N-dimethylphenylenediamine,<br>
naphthylamine,       4-(4-nitrophenylazo)aniline       (disperse       orange       3),<br>
sulphamethazine, 4-phenoxyaniline, 3-nitroaniline, 4-aminoacetanilide (N-(4-<br>
aminophenyl)acetamide)), 4-amino-2-hydroxy-benzoic acid phenyl ester (phenyl amino salicylate), N-(4-amino-phenyl)-benzamide, various benzyl-amines such as 2,5-dimethoxybenzylamine, 4-phenylazoaniline, and substituted versions of these. Other examples include para-ethoxyaniline, para-dodecyl-aniline, cyclohexyl-substituted naphthylamine, and thienyl-substituted aniline. [0070] Additional aromatic amines and related compounds are disclosed in U.S. Patent 6,107,257 and 6,107,258; some of these include aminocarbazoles, benzoimidazoles, aminoindoles, aminopyrroles, amino-indazolinones, aminoperimidines, mercaptotriazoles, aminophenothiazines, aminopyridines, aminopyrazines, aminopyrimidines, pyridines, pyrazines, pyrimidines, aminothiadiazoles, aminothiothiadiazoles, and aminobenzotriaozles. Other suitable amines include 3-amino-N-(4-anilinophenyl)-N-isopropyl butanamide, and N-(4-anilinophenyl)-3-{(3-aminopropyl)-(cocoalkyl)amino} butanamide. [0071] In one embodiment the aromatic amine may be useful as an antioxidant. Of particular importance in that regard are alkylated diphenylamines such as nonyldiphenylamine and dinonyldiphenylamine. To the extent that these materials will condense with the carboxylic functionality of the polymer chain, they are also suitable for use within the present invention. However, it is believed that the two aromatic groups attached to the amine nitrogen may lead to steric hindrance and reduced reactivity. Thus, suitable amines include those having a primary nitrogen atom (-NH2) or a secondary nitrogen atom in which one of the hydrocarbyl substituents is a relatively short chain alkyl group, e.g., methyl. Among such aromatic amines are 4-phenylazoaniline, 4-aminodiphenylamine, 2-aminobenzimidazole, and N,N-dimethylphenylenediamine. Some of these and other aromatic amines may also impart antioxidant performance to the polymers, in addition to dispersancy and other properties.<br>
[0072] The above-described aromatic amines may be used alone or in combination with each other. They can also be used in combination with additional, aromatic or non-aromatic, e.g., aliphatic, amines, which, in one embodiment, have 1 to 8 carbon atoms. Other aromatic amines can include such amines as aminodiphenylamine. These additional amines may be included<br>
for a variety of reasons. Sometimes it may be desirable to incorporate an<br>
aliphatic amine in order to assure complete reaction of the acid functionality of<br>
the polymer, in the event that some residual acid functionality may tend to react<br>
incompletely with the relatively more bulky aromatic amine. Alternatively, the -<br>
aliphatic amine may replace a portion of a more costly aromatic amine, while<br>
maintaining the majority of the performance of the aromatic amine. Aliphatic<br>
monoamines include methylamine, ethylamine, propylamine and various higher<br>
amines. Diamines or polyamines may be used for this function, provided that,<br>
in general, they have only a single reactive amino group, that is, a primary or<br>
secondary group; and typically a primary group. Suitable examples of diamines<br>
include	dimethylaminopropylamine,	diethylaminopropylamine,<br>
dibutylaminopropylamine, dimethylaminoethylamine, diethylaminoethylamine, dibutylaminoethylamine, 1 -(2-aminoethyl)piperidine, 1 -(2-aminoethyl)-pyrrolidone, aminoethylmorpholine, and aminopropylmorpholine. The amount of such an amine is typically a minor amount compared with the amount of the aromatic amine, that is, less than 50% of the total amine present on a weight or molar basis, although higher amounts may be used, such as 70 to 130% or 90 to 110%. Exemplary amounts include 10 to 70 weight percent, or 15 to 50 weight percent, or 20 to 40 weight percent. Use of certain combinations of 4-phenoxyaniline with dimethylaminopropylamine within these ranges, for instance, provides particularly good performance in terms of soot suspension. In certain embodiments, the polymers may be functionalised with three or more different amines, for instance, with 3-nitroaniline, 4-(4-nitrophenylazo)aniline, and dimethylaminopropylamine.<br>
[0073] In one embodiment the aromatic amine may be selected from the<br>
group consisting of xylylenediamine, aniline, 4-aminodiphenylamine,<br>
benzylamine,        phenethylamine,        3,4-dimethoxyphenethylamine,	1,4-<br>
dimethylphenylenediamine, and mixtures thereof.<br>
[0074] In one embodiment the aromatic amine may be selected from the group consisting of xylylenediamine, aniline, 4-aminodiphenylamine, 1,4-dimethyl-phenylenediamine, and mixtures thereof.<br>
[0075] An additive of Formula (1) derived from one of the aromatic amines and from a polyisobutylene polymer backbone is believed to have dispersant properties. Examples of suitable structures of dispersant additives derived from aniline or 4-aminophenylamine may be represented by the formulae:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 [0076] An additive of Formula (1) derived from one of the aromatic amines and from a non-polyisobutylene polymer backbone is believed to have dispersant viscosity modifying properties, and is particularly useful for soot control. Examples of suitable structures of DVM additives derived from aniline or 4-aminophenylamine may be represented by the formulae:<br>

wherein BB is an ethylene-propylene copolymer and u is defined above. Additives of this type are believed to be derived from ethylene-propylene copolymers grafted with maleic anhydride and functionalised to form the imide group.<br>
[0077] In one embodiment Z may be derivable from an aminoalcohol. The<br>
aminoalcohol may contain one or more hydroxyl groups and one or more amino<br>
groups. The aminoalcohol in different embodiments of this invention may<br>
contain 1 to 6 or 1 to 3 hydroxyl groups, 1 to 8 or 1 to 2 amino groups, and 2 to<br>
50 or 2 to 40 or 2 to 25 or 2 to 15 carbon atoms. The aminoalcohol may be a<br>
monoalkanolamine, a dialkanolamine, a trialkanolamine or mixtures thereof.<br>
Examples of a suitable aminoalcohol may include ethanolamine,<br>
isopropanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, N,N-diethylethanolamine,<br>

propanediol, serinol, 2-amino-2-methyl-l,3-propanediol, tris(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane, diisopropanolamine, N-methyldiethanolamine, 2-(2-aminoethylamino)ethanol, or mixtures thereof.<br>
[0078] In one embodiment Z may be derivable from an alcohol. The alcohol may be a monohydric alcohol, a polyhydric alcohol, or mixtures thereof. [0079] Examples of a suitable monohydric alcohol include methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, n-butanol, n-hexanol, n-octanol, n-decanol, n-dodecanol, n-tetradecanol, n-hexadecanol, n-octadecanol, isopropanol, isobutanol, tert-butanol,  2-ethylbutanol,  2-ethylhexanol,  3-heptanol,  3,5,5-trimethylhexanol,<br>
3,7-dimethyloctanol and the so-called Guerbet alcohols such as those which are commercially available under the trade name Isofol (ex Condea GmbH) including mixtures thereof. Specific examples of Guerbet alcohols are Isofol 12, 14T, 16, 18T, 18E, 20, 24, 28, 32, 32T and 36.<br>
[0080] Examples of a suitable polyhydric alcohol include ethylene glycol,<br>

propanediol (trimethylolpropane), 1,2,4-hexanetriol and mixtures thereof.<br>
[0081] In one embodiment Z may be derivable from a thiol, or mixtures<br>
thereof. Examples of a suitable thiol include thioglycolic acid, thioethanol (2-<br>
mercapto ethanol), C8-io-thiol alcohols, benzyl mercaptan, thiophenols, or<br>
mixtures thereof.<br>
[0082] The process to prepare the additive of the present invention may be either a one pot reaction or a two-pot reaction.<br>
[0083] In one embodiment the invention provides a lubricating composition comprising:<br>
(a)	an oil of lubricating viscosity; and<br>
(b)	an additive obtained/obtainable by a process comprising reacting:<br>
(1)	an anthranilic anhydride;<br>
(2)	a polymer containing either:<br>
(i) an anhydride group;<br>
(ii) a carboxylic acid group; or<br>
(iii) an acyl group; and<br>
(3)	at least one member of the group selected from<br>
(i) an amine, wherein the amine contains a primary or secondary amino-group; (ii) an alcohol;<br>
(iii) an aminoalcohol; and<br>
(iv) a thiol, to form the additive. [0084] The process outlined may react (1), (2) and (3) in any order. When the process reacts (2) and (3) followed by reaction with (1), the product formed may be described as being post-treated with the anthranilic anhydride. Typically, post-treated products comprise a polyisobutylene succinimide that may be derived from a polyamine. A non-limiting reaction scheme for a post-treated product is:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
[0085] The nature of the polyisobutylene (Pib) may be the same as described above. A person skilled in the art will appreciate that although the product shown above shows four moles of isatoic anhydride reacting with the amine other products may be derived from one or two isatoic anhydride pendant groups. It is believed that where one mole of isatoic anhydride reacts with the polyisobutylene succinimide the reaction kinetically reacts with a primary amino group. The reaction scheme may be represented by:<br>
 <br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
[0086]      The reaction scheme above would also equally apply for the other<br>
polyalkylenepolyamines described above.<br>
[0087]      In one embodiment the invention provides a lubricating composition<br>
comprising:<br>
(a)	an oil of lubricating viscosity; and<br>
(b)	an additive obtained/obtainable by a process comprising the steps of:<br>
(1)	reacting an anthranilic anhydride (typically isatoic anhydride)<br>
with either:<br>
(i) an amine, wherein the amine contains a primary or secondary amino-group; (ii) an alcohol; (iii) an aminoalcohol; or (iv) a thiol, to form a product; and<br>
(2)	reacting the product of step (1) with a polymer containing<br>
either:<br>
(i) an anhydride group; (ii) a carboxylic acid group; or (iii) an acyl group, to form the additive. [0088]        The process outlined above, may be considered to be either a one-pot or a two-pot process. A one-pot process typically charges all reactants into a vessel before forming a product. The two-pot process typically reacts (1) and (2) in a vessel before later reaction with (3).    Irrespective of whether the reaction is performed by one-pot or two-pot process it is believed that the<br>
anthranilic anhydride initially reacts with the selected reactant from the amine, aminoalcohol, alcohol or thiol to form a product that reacts with the polymer. [0089] The processes described above may be carried out at a reaction temperature in the range of 40 °C to 180 °C, or 50 °C to 170 °C. [0090] The reaction may or may not be carried out in the presence of a solvent. Examples of a suitable solvent include diluent oil, benzene, t-butyl benzene, toluene, xylene, chlorobenzene, hexane, tetrahydrofuran, or mixtures thereof.<br>
[0091] The reaction may be preformed in either air or an inert atmosphere. Examples of suitable inert atmosphere include nitrogen or argon, typically nitrogen.<br>
Oils of Lubricating Viscosity<br>
[0092] The lubricating composition comprises an oil of lubricating viscosity. Such oils include natural and synthetic oils, oil derived from hydrocracking, hydrogenation, and hydrofinishing, unrefined, refined and re-refined oils and mixtures thereof.<br>
[0093] Unrefined oils are those obtained directly from a natural or synthetic source generally without (or with little) further purification treatment. [0094] Refined oils are similar to the unrefined oils except they have been further treated in one or more purification steps to improve one or more properties. Purification techniques are known in the art and include solvent extraction, secondary distillation, acid or base extraction, filtration, percolation and the like.<br>
[0095] Re-refined oils are also known as reclaimed or reprocessed oils, and are obtained by processes similar to those used to obtain refined oils and often are additionally processed by techniques directed to removal of spent additives and oil breakdown products.<br>
[0096] Natural oils useful in making the inventive lubricants include animal oils, vegetable oils (e.g., castor oil,), mineral lubricating oils such as liquid petroleum oils and solvent-treated or acid-treated mineral lubricating oils of the paraffinic, naphthenic or mixed paraffinic-naphthenic types and oils derived from coal or shale or mixtures thereof.<br>
[0097] Synthetic lubricating oils are useful and include hydrocarbon oils such as polymerised and interpolymerised olefins (e.g., polybutylenes, polypropylenes, propyleneisobutylene copolymers); poly(l-hexenes), poly(l-octenes),- poly(l-decenes), and mixtures thereof; alkyl-benzenes (e:g. dodecylbenzenes, tetradecylbenzenes, dinonylbenzenes, di-(2-ethylhexyl)-benzenes); polyphenyls (e.g., biphenyls, terphenyls, alkylated polyphenyls); diphenyl alkanes, alkylated diphenyl alkanes, alkylated diphenyl ethers and alkylated diphenyl sulphides and the derivatives, analogs and homologs thereof or mixtures thereof.<br>
[0098] Other synthetic lubricating oils include polyol esters (such as Priolube®3970), diesters, liquid esters of phosphorus-containing acids (e.g., tricresyl phosphate, trioctyl phosphate, and the diethyl ester of decane phosphonic acid), or polymeric tetrahydrofurans. Synthetic oils may be produced by Fischer-Tropsch reactions and typically may be hydroisomerised Fischer-Tropsch hydrocarbons or waxes. In one embodiment oils may be prepared by a Fischer-Tropsch gas-to-liquid synthetic procedure as well as other gas-to-liquid oils.<br>
[0099] Oils of lubricating viscosity may also be defined as specified in the American Petroleum Institute (API) Base Oil Interchangeability Guidelines. The five base oil groups are as follows: Group I (sulphur content &gt;0.03 wt %, and/or 90 wt % saturates, viscosity index 80-120); Group III (sulphur content 90 wt % saturates, viscosity index &gt;120); Group IV (all polyalphaolefins (PAOs)); and Group V (all others not included in Groups I, II, III, or IV). The oil of lubricating viscosity comprises an API Group I, Group II, Group III, Group IV, Group V oil or mixtures thereof. Often the oil of lubricating viscosity is an API Group I, Group II, Group III, Group IV oil or mixtures thereof. Alternatively the oil of lubricating viscosity is often an API Group II, Group III or Group IV oil or mixtures thereof. [0100] The amount of the oil of lubricating viscosity present is typically the balance remaining after subtracting from 100 wt % the sum of the amount of the additive as described herein above, and the other performance additives.<br>
[0101]      The lubricating composition may be in the form of a concentrate<br>
and/or a fully formulated lubricant.    If the lubricating composition of the<br>
invention is in the form of a concentrate (which may be combined with<br>
additional oil to form, in whole or in part, a finished lubricant), the ratio of the<br>
of components of the invention to the oil of lubricating viscosity and/or to<br>
diluent oil include the ranges of 1:99 to 99:1 by weight, or 80:20 to 10:90 by<br>
weight.<br>
Other Performance Additives<br>
[0102]      The composition optionally comprises other performance additives.<br>
The other performance additives comprise at least one of metal deactivators,<br>
viscosity modifiers, detergents, friction modifiers, antiwear agents, corrosion<br>
inhibitors, dispersants (other than the additive of Formula (1) as disclosed<br>
herein), dispersant viscosity modifiers  (other than the additive of Formula (1)<br>
as disclosed herein), extreme pressure agents, antioxidants, foam inhibitors,<br>
demulsifiers, pour point depressants, seal swelling agents and mixtures thereof.<br>
Typically, fully-formulated lubricating oil will contain one or more of these<br>
performance additives.<br>
Industrial Application<br>
[0103]       The additive of the invention may be added to a lubricant in a range<br>
of 0.01 wt % to 20 wt %, or 0.05 wt % to 10 wt %, or 0.08 wt % to 5 wt %, or<br>
0.1 wt % to 3 wt % of the lubricating composition.<br>
[0104]      The   lubricating   composition   may   be   utilised   in   an   internal<br>
combustion engine.   The internal combustion engine may or may not have an<br>
EGR.<br>
[0105]      In one embodiment the internal combustion engine may be a diesel<br>
fuelled engine (typically a heavy duty diesel engine), a gasoline fuelled engine,<br>
a natural gas fuelled engine or a mixed gasoline/alcohol fuelled engine.  In one<br>
embodiment the internal combustion engine may be a diesel fuelled engine and<br>
in another embodiment a gasoline fuelled engine.<br>
[0106]      The internal combustion engine may be a 2-stroke or 4-stroke<br>
engine.   Suitable internal combustion engines include marine diesel engines,<br>
aviation piston engines, low-load diesel engines, and automobile and truck<br>
engines.<br>
[0107]      The lubricant composition for an internal combustion engine may be<br>
suitable for any engine lubricant irrespective of the sulphur, phosphorus or<br>
sulphated ash (ASTM D-874) content.   The sulphur content of the engine oil<br>
lubricant may be 1 wt % or less, or 0.8 wt % or less, or 0.5 wt % or less, or 0.3<br>
wt % or less.   In one embodiment the sulphur content may be in the range of<br>
0.001 wt % to 0.5 wt %, or 0.01 wt % to 0.3 wt %.   The phosphorus content<br>
may be 0.2 wt % or less, or 0.1 wt % or less, or 0.085 wt % or less, or even<br>
0.06 wt % or less, 0.055 wt % or less, or 0.05 wt % or less. In one embodiment<br>
the phosphorus content may be 100 ppm to 1000 ppm, or 325 ppm to 700 ppm.<br>
The total sulphated ash content may be 2 wt % or less, or 1.5 wt % or less, or<br>
1.1 wt % or less, or 1 wt % or less, or 0.8 wt % or less, or 0.5 wt % or less. In<br>
one embodiment the sulphated ash content may be 0.05 wt % to 0.9 wt %, or<br>
0.1 wt % to 0.2 wt % to 0.45 wt %.<br>
[0108]      In one embodiment the lubricating composition is an engine oil,<br>
wherein the lubricating composition is characterised as having at least one of<br>
(i) a sulphur content of 0.5 wt % or less, (ii) a phosphorus content of 0.1 wt %<br>
or less, and (iii) a sulphated ash content of 1.5 wt % or less.<br>
[0109]      In one embodiment the lubricating composition is suitable for a 2-<br>
stroke  or  a  4-stroke  marine  diesel  internal  combustion  engine.     In  one<br>
embodiment the marine diesel combustion engine is a 2-stroke engine.   The<br>
ashless antiwear agent of the invention may be added to a marine diesel<br>
lubricating composition at 0.01 to 20 wt %, or 0.05 to 10 wt %, or 0.1 to 5 wt<br>
%.<br>
[0110]       The following examples provide illustrations of the invention. These<br>
examples are non-exhaustive and are not intended to limit the scope of the<br>
invention.<br>

[0136] A series of samples prepared above are evaluated in a drain oil rheology test The samples are based on engine oil lubricants with low sulphur, phosphorous and ash content. The samples contain an amount of product from the preparative examples described above. The samples are analysed using the oscillation rheology test with a TA Instruments AR500™ rheometer in oscillation mode. The test geometry is a 40 mm flat top plate, and the sample is placed directly onto the flat variable temperature peltier plate of the rheometer. The samples are pre-sheared for 30 seconds at a shear stress of 0.080 Pa to ensure that all samples have a similar baseline shear history. The samples are allowed to equilibrate for 5 minutes before the oscillation test is initiated. The samples are equilibrated for a further 1 minute between each temperature step. Sample evaluation is performed with a temperature sweep test at a constant strain of 0.06, covering the temperature range of 40 °C to 150 °C with measurements taken at a total of 30 points. G' is the elastic, or storage modulus, and m defined in more detail in The Rheology Handbook, Thomas G. Mezger (edited by Ulrich Zoll), Published by Vincentz, 2002, ISBN 3-87870-745-2, p. 117. Generally, better results are obtained for samples with a lower G' value. The data obtained is shown in table 1. In table 1, COMP1 is a baseline sooted drain oil, G' ratio is calculated from a ratio of a G'max of each candidate species to<br>
that of the equivalent reference oil to provide a normalised measure of reduction in<br>
structure build-up.<br>
[0137]      In each case, the calculation of G' Ratio is made by comparison to a<br>
representative sooted drain oil.   The sooted drain oil is analysed prior to each<br>
sample to allow G' ratio calculation.<br>
[0138]      The results obtained for the rheology screen test indicate that the<br>
additive of the invention reduces soot structure built-up relative to untreated<br>
drain oil.<br>
