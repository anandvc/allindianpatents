The process of this invention is particularly interesting using<br>
Compounds of formulae I, II and III, wherein<br>

Chloro, bromo, methyl, ethyl, methoxy, ethoxy, methylamino,<br>

O<br>
II<br>
Yis    -OX1  ,and<br>
Z is chloro or bromo.<br>
In formulae I and II, A is preferably a direct bond, Rt and R2 are preferably identical, and R3 is preferably chloro, bromo or C1-C4alkyl.<br>
Alkali metal formate or alkaline earth metal formate can be sodium formate, potassium formate, magnesium formate and calcium formate, preferably calcium formate, in the amounts stated for compounds X'-H of formula III. The formates can also act as bases.<br>
Compounds of formula II are known or can be prepared by known methods such as described in US 4 415 685, 4 579 949 and 4 791 204 mentioned at the outset, in particular in US 4 579 949.<br>
It has been found that the molar ratio of diketopyrrolopyrroles of formula II to formic acid or X'-H may vary in a wide range. To prevent impurities, a lower limit of 1:1 is recommended, or of 1:2, if Y in formula II is -COX. In the case of reactions with X'-H compounds of low molar weight, such as methanol, the molar ratio of diketopyrrolopyrroles of formula II to X'-H can become very small, in particular if it is desired that compound X'-H should also act as solvent.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of this invention, the molar ratio of diketopyrrolopyrroles of formula II to formic acid or X'-H or to alkali metal formate or alkaline earth metal formate is chosen in the range from 1:1 to 1:1000, preferably from 1:1 to 1:20, or, if Y in formula II<br>
O II is -OX , in the range from 1:2 to 1:2000, preferably from 1:4 to 1:40.<br>
It has also been found that the carboxylation can preferably be carried out in an organic solvent.<br>
Suitable solvents are usually all customary, preferably polar, organic solvents, aprotic or protic, more preferred aprotic polar solvents, or mixtures of such solvents with one another or with water, preferably those wherein at least one solvent is polar. It is convenient to use, for example, N-methylpyrrolidone, dimethylformamide or dimethylacetamide, preferably N-methylpyrrolidone.<br>
It is usually possible to carry out the reaction in the presence of those known catalysts which assist a reaction of the inventive kind.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of this invention, the catalysts are palladium catalysts. Suitable catalysts are usually the commonly known mono- or polydentate complexes of palladium, preferably with tertiary phosphines, such as those of formulae<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The palladium catalyst can be, and is preferably, prepared also in situ from a suitable palladium salt, such as palladium chloride and palladium acetate, and a tertiary phosphine, such as triphenylphosphine, tricyclohexylphosphine and bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane.<br>
The use of palladium(ll) chloride and triphenylphosphine is particularly preferred.<br>
The catalyst is preferably used in an amount of 0.01 to 50 mol %, preferably of 0.1 to 30 mol %, based on the diketopyrrolopyrrole of formula II.<br>
It has furthermore been found that, under certain circumstances, the inventive reaction may advantageously be carried out in the presence of a base. The invention therefore also relates to the novel reaction described above which is carried out in the presence of a base.<br>
Suitable bases are, for example, tertiary amines, such as triethylamine, tripropylamine, tributylamine, N-methylpiperidine, N-methylmorpholine or benzyldimethylamine, and also alkali metal salts or alkaline earth metal salts of carboxylic acids containing 1 -4 carbon atoms, such as sodium acetate, potassium acetate, sodium formate, potassium formate and calcium formate, as well as alkali metal salts or alkaline earth metal salts of weak mineral acids, such as potassium phosphate or sodium phosphate.<br>
If the carboxylation is carried out using a primary or secondary amine of formula X'-H (III), wherein X' is -N(R5)(R6), then an excess of this amine can also serve as a base. In this case it is preferred to use 1 to 20 mol, preferably 2 to 10 mol, of an excess, based on the diketopyrrolopyrrole II used, or 1 to 40 mol, preferably 4 to 20 mol, if the diketopyrrolopyrrole II used contains two -COX-groups.<br>
It is preferred to use a tertiary amine, preferably triethylamine.<br>
The base is conveniently added in an amount of 1 to 20, preferably of 1 to 4, molar equivalents, based on the diketopyrrolopyrrole of formula II, if Y is R3, and in an amount of 2 to<br>
40, preferably of 2 to 10, molar equivalents, if Y is — CX .<br>
The novel process is preferably carried out at a pressure in the range from 100 kPa (1 bar) to 10 MPa, preferably from 100 kPa to 5 MPa (50 bar), and at a temperature from 10 to 220, preferably from 50 to 200, more preferred from 100 to 180°C. The reaction is particularly preferably carried out at a carbon monoxide partial pressure in the range from 0.1 to 5 MPa, preferably from 0.5 to 2.5 MPa, if the carboxylation is carried out using compound X'-H of formula III.<br>
As may be found already in US patents 4 415 685, 4 579 949, 4 791 204 and 5 476 886 mentioned at the outset, the diketopyrrolopyrrolecarboxylic acids, diketopyrrolopyrrolecarbo-xylates and diketopyrrolopyrrolecarboxamides have good pigment properties and are therefore very well suited for pigmenting high molecular weight organic material. They are distinguished in particular by having high chroma.<br>
Depending on their application, the compounds prepared according to this invention can be used as pigments directly after synthesis or after a customary and commonly known post-treatment.<br>
