				<td>The present invention relates to a process for preparing a l-methyl-3-propyl-lH-pyrazole-5-carboxamide compound.<br>
The present application is a divisional application of Indian patent number 193327 (Indian Patent Application number 1344/DEL/99)<br>
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of 1-[[3-(6,7-dihydro-1-methyl-7-oxo-3-propyl-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidin-5-yl)-4-ethoxyphenyl]sulfonyl]-4-methylpiperazine(otherwise known as sildenafil or Viagra™), and 1-Ethyl-4-{3-[3-ethyl-6,7-dihydro-7-oxo-2-(2-pyridylmethyl)-2H-pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidin-5-yl]-4-propoxyphenylsulphonyl}piperazine and key intermediates thereof.<br>
1 -[[3-(6,7-dihydro-1 -methyl-7-oxo-3-propyl-1 H-pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidin-5-yl)-4-ethoxyphenyl]sulfonyl]-4-methylpiperazine (otherwise known as sildenafil) has been found to be particularly useful in the treatment of, inter alia, male erectile dysfunction (WO-A-94/28907), and a process for its preparation is disclosed in EP-A-0463756 (example 12) and Drugs of the Future 1997, 22(2): 138-143. An improved process for preparing sildenafil (over that of EP0463756) is disclosed in EP-A-0812845, with the characterising final step involving cyclisation under basic, neutral or acidic conditions to form sildenafil. A process for the preparation of 1-Ethyl-4-{3-[3-ethyl-6,7-dihydro-7-oxo-2-(2-pyridylmethyl)-2H-pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidin-5-yl]-4-propoxyphenylsulphonyljpiperazine is disclosed in WO 98/49166 (example 5B)^:-—<br>
The present inventors have now found a process for preparing sildenafil and 1-Ethyl-4-{3-[3-ethyl-6,7-dihydro-7-oxo-2-(2-pyridylmethyl)-2H-pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidin-5-yl]-4-propoxyphenylsulphonyl}piperazine which has advantages over the aforementioned prior art processes.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a process for preparing a compound of formula (IA) and (IB)<br><br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
comprising reacting a compound of (IIA) and (IIB) respectively in the presence of OR, wherein R in the case of formation of compound (IA) is CH2CH3 and R in the case of formation of compound (IB) is CH2CH2CH3, where X is a leaving group: (Figure Removed)<br>
A particular advantage of the present process over that of the prior art is the elimination of steps by carrying out a substitution reaction and ring closure in 'one pot'<br>
The intermediates of general formula (HA) and (IIB) form a further aspect of the invention,<br>
A key intermediate of the general formula (IMA) and (1MB) (see schemes 1 and 2 hereafter) have been identified in various reactions showing that such reactions at least partially go via a pathway of cyclisation then nucleophilic substitution. Accordingly intermediates of general formula (IIIA) and (1MB) form yet a further aspect of the invention (wherein X is a leaving group).<br>
A further major intermediate of formula IVA and IVB have also been identified, suggesting that there is also nucleophilic substitution before cyclisation (and these intermediates, where novel, form a further aspect of the invention).<br><br>
Thus the proposed reaction pathways for the formation of compounds (IA) and (IB) are as follows<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The relative proportion of intermediates formed is partially dependent on the nature of X (the leaving group).<br>
Preferably X is selected from the group consisting of optionally substituted<br>
arylsulphonyloxy preferably phenylsulphonyloxy, more preferably a para substituted<br>
aryl (phenyl) such as by a CrC4 alkyl group e.g. p-toluenesulphonyloxy;<br>
d-C4 alkylsulphonyloxy e.g. methanesulphonyloxy;<br>
nitro or halo substituted benzenesulphonyloxy preferably para substituted e.g.<br>
p-bromobenzenesulfonyloxy or p-nitrobenzenesulphonyloxy;<br>
CrC4 perfluoroalkylsulphonyloxy e.g. trifluoromethylsulphonyloxy;<br>
optionally substituted aroyloxy such as benzoyloxy;<br>
d-C4 perfluoroalkanoyloxy such as trifluoroacetyloxy;<br>
d-C4 alkanoyloxy such as acetyloxy;<br>
halo; diazonium; CrC4 primary and secondary alkoxy such as methoxy;<br>
oxonium; perchloryloxy;<br>
quatenaryammoniurn CrC4 alkylsulphonyloxy; halosulphonyloxy e.g.<br>
fluorosulphonyloxy and other fluorinated leaving groups; halonium; and<br>
diarylsulphonylamino e.g. ditosyl (NTs2).<br>
Suitably X is a halo (fluoro, chloro, bromo or iodo) or methoxy, and most suitably it is fluoro or chloro. The latter have been found to provide particularly good yields, and inexpensive commercially available starting materials ( chloro and fluoro benzoic acid) can readily be used.<br>
Herein  OCH-CH 
 <br>
OR can be generated in solution from, a salt ZOR (wherein Z is a cation) such as a metal salt. More particularly an alkali (such as sodium or potassium) or alkaline earth metal salt of OR in a suitable solvent would give rise to OR in solution. For example sodium ethoxide (Na+~ OEt) in a suitable solvent with intermediate (IIA) would form sildenafil. In another embodiment,  OR is formed insitu from ROM plus an auxiliary base (i.e. a base other than   OR). However, in another system, ZOR could be used in the reaction system with an auxiliary base.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the invention are:<br>
1.  the synthesis of compound (IA) by reaction of compound (IIA):<br>
a)	with ethanol and auxiliary base, optionally in an inert solvent;<br>
b)	with ZOEt and an auxiliary base in ethanol or an inert solvent or both;<br>
c)	with ZOEt and ethanol or an inert solvent or both.<br>
the synthesis of compound (IB) by reaction of compound (MB):<br>
d)	with propano! arid auxiliary base, optionally in an inert solvent;<br>
e)	with ZOPr and an auxiliary base, in propanol or an inert solvent or both;<br>
f)	with ZOPr, and propanol or an inert solvent or both.<br>
As will be appreciated the solvent in which the reaction takes place can be ROM or an inert solvent (or a mixture of both). By inert solvent we mean a solvent which will not form a nucleophile under the reaction conditions or if a nucleophile is formed it is sufficiently hindered such that it does not substantially compete in the displacement reaction. When ROM is used as a source of "OR, then a separate solvent is not essentially required but an (auxiliary) inert solvent (i.e. a solvent other than ROM) may be used as a co-solvent in the reaction.<br>
Suitable solvents are as follows:<br><br>
ethanol (for IA), propanol (for IB) (n-propanol), a secondary or tertiary C4-Ci2 alkanol, a C3-Ci, cycloalkanol, a tertiary C4-Cia cycloalkanol, a secondary or tertiary (C3-C7 cycloalkyl)C2-C6 alkanol, a Ca-Cg alkanone, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, 1,2-diethoxyethane, diglyme, tetrahydrofuran, 1,4-dioxan, toluene, xylene, &gt;    chlorobenzene, 1,2-dichlorobenzene, acetonitrile, dimethyl sulphoxide, sulpholane, dimethylformarrude, N-methylpyrrolidin-2-one, pyridine, and mixtures thereof.<br>
A wide range of auxiliary bases can be used in the process of the invention. Typically the bases would not compete with OR in the nucleophilic substitution of X )    (i.e.they would be non nucleophilic) by suitably being sterically hindered. Preferred bases in accordance with the invention are selected from the group consisting of metal salts of a sterically hindered alcohol or amine such as a secondary or tertiary C4-Ci2 alkanol, a C;rCi2 cycloalkanol and a secondary or teritary (C3-C8 cycloalkyl)CrC6 alkanol, a N-(secondary or tertiary Ca-Ce alkyl)-N-(primary, secondary or tertiary C3~C6 alkyl)amine, a N-(C3-C8 cycloalkyl)-N-(primary, secondary or tertiary C3-C6 alkyl)amine, a di(C3-C8 cycloalkyl)amine or hexarnethyldisilazane;<br>
metal salts of 1-methyl piperazine (especially for compound IA), 1-ethylpiperazine (especially for compound IB), and rnorpholine;<br>
1,5-diazabicyclo[4,3,0]non-5-ene and 1,8-diazabicyclo[5,4,0]undec-7-ene; tertiary amines such as triethylamine; metal hydride, oxide, carbonate, and bicarbonate.<br>
Preferably the metal of the salt of ZOR and the auxiliary base are independently selected from alkali metals (lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, caesium) or alkaline earth metals (beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium). More preferably the metal is sodium or potassium.<br>
Preferably the auxiliary base is selected from the group consisting of metal salts of a sterically hindered alcohol or amine such as a secondary or tertiary C4-Ci2 alkanol, a<br><br>
Ca-Ci2 cycloalkanol and a secondary or tertiary (C3-C8 cycloalkyl)CrC6 alkanol, a N-<br>
(secondary or tertiary C3-C6 alkyl)-N-(primary, secondary or tertiary C3-C6<br>
alkyl)amine, a N~(C:rC8 cycloalkyl)-N-(primary, secondary or tertiary C3-C6<br>
alkyl)amine, a di(C;rCa cycloalkyl)amine or hexamethyldisilazane;<br>
1,5~diazabicyclo|4,3,0]non-5-ene and 1,8-diazabicyclo[5,4,0]undec-7-ene;<br>
metal hydride, oxide, carbonate and bicarbonate.<br>
More preferably still, the auxiliary base is selected from the sterically hindered bases of the previous paragraph (i.e. all of them except the metal hydride, oxide, carbonate and bicarbonate)<br>
Most preferably the auxiliary base is the metal salt of a tertiary C4-C6 alcohol such as the alkali or alkaline earth metal salts (e.g. Na/K) of t-butanol or t-amyl alcohol.<br>
To maximise yields, it is further preferred that at least one molecular equivalent (suitably one and a half equivalent) of auxiliary base and OR are used in accordance with the invention. If OR also functions as a base then preferably at least two equivalents, (more preferably three equivalents) of "OR are present. Thus for example in preferred embodiments (a) to (f) above, preferably there is at least 2 equivalents of auxiliary base and at least one equivalent of EtOH or PrOH (a and d respectively ), preferably at least 1 equivalent of auxiliary base and at least 1 equivalent of ZOEt or ZOPr (b and e respectively) and preferably at least 2 equivalents of ZOEt or ZOPr ( c and f respectively). These are   equivalents with respect to the molar quantities of MA or MB.<br>
The nature of the leaving group (X) may influence the reaction pathway. For example with reference to scheme 1 for compound (IA), when X = F the reaction mostly proceeds via the intermediate illustrated by (IVA) but when the X = Cl the pathway shifts more towards the intermediate of (IMA), and when X = OCH3 there is more of the formula (IIIA) intermediate formed than the formula (IVA) type intermediate.  However, formation of the final compound of formulae (IA) and (IB) from the intermediate formulae (IIIA) and (IIIB) respectively can be encouraged by using a higher temperature and allowing more time for formation of the final product.<br>
Preferably the general reaction is carried out at from 50°C to 170°C. Thus where X=F, the reaction temperature could be anything from about 50°C, preferably 60°C upward and the rate of formation of the final product would be very good. For X=CI, preferably a temperature of 60 to 170°C, more suitably at least 80°C such as (80°C to 110°C) would increase the rate; and for X=OCH3 , preferably a temperature of at least 80°C, more suitably at least 110°C (such as 110°C to 140°C) would increase the rate to the final product.<br>
The compounds of general formula (IIA) and (IIB) may be obtained from readily available starting materials for example, by the route depicted in the following reaction schemes   Reaction scheme 3 is illustrated for compound (IA) and scheme 4 is illustrated for compound (IB).<br>
With reference to scheme 3, the intermediate of formula (VIA) is formed from a substituted (i.e. group X) benzoic acid derivative by reaction with chlorosulphonic acid. Intermediate (VIA) is then reacted with N-methylpiperazine in the presence of a base, such as a tertiary amine, more particularly triethylamine and a suitable solvent such as acetone or water to form intermediate (VIIA).<br>
(IIA) is formed by reaction of intermediate (VIIA) and 4-amino-1-methyl-3-propyl-1H-pyrazole-S-carboxamide (compound IXA) in the presence of a coupling agent, such as 1 ~(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethyl carbodiimide hydrochloride and where desirable also in the presence of a base and/or an accelerator. In one example of a coupling system the carboxylic acid function of (VIIA) is first of all activitated using about a 5% excess of a reagent such as N,N-carbonyldimidazole (as coupling agent) in a suitable solvent, e.g. ethyl acetate, at from about room temperature to about 80yC, followed by reaction of the intermediate imidazolide with (IXA) at from about 20 to about 60eC, In another example, intermediate (VIIA) could be coupled to the pyrazole (IXA) in the presence of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole, triethylamine and 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethyl-carbodiimide hydrochloride.<br>
Compound (IXA) is formed by reducing 1-methyl-4 nitro-3-propyl-1H-pyrazole-5 carboxamide (VIIA) such as by hydrogenation in the presence of 5% palladium on charcoal.<br>
Compound (IB) (scheme 4) can be formed in an analogous fashion to that of compound (IA). More particularly, intermediate (VIIB) is prepared by reacting (VIA) with N-ethylpiperazine; and intermediate (IIB) is formed by coupling intermediate compounds (VIIBj and (IXB). (Figure Removed)<br>
The intermediates of general formulae (VIIA) and (VIIB) are novel and form a further aspect of the invention (wherein X is as defined hereinbefore)<br>
