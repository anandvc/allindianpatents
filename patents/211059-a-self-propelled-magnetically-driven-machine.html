				<td>1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The field of present invention relates broadly to a novel machine in which the machine runs without receiving continuous power, and specifically to a self-propelled magnetically driven machine. According to this invention, specific power transformation is possible when at least two mechanical capacitors are interconnected by a specific kind of lever thereby producing mechanical momentums by the said capacitors. During start up of the said machine the said capacitors transform greater power than that of the power transmission during the machine-in-motion. The essential feature of the present invention lies in building up a strong magnetic field by which continuous momentums can be transmitted by the said capacitors. This type of machine is very useful when used in conjunction with a prime mover.<br>
2. BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Conventionally in engines, mechanical momentum is produced with the help of flywheels, i.e., mechanical capacitors. Continuous source of power is compulsory to achieve such mechanical momentums of flywheels.<br>
A magnetic wheel drive is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,179,633 (Pat "633) for "Magnetic Wheel Drive" (Inventor: Donald A. Kelly, December 18, 1979). US Pat "633 teaches a wheel having a series of permanent magnets radially disposed along its circumference. These permanent magnets are arranged to interact with a series of pairs of permanent magnets placed on oscillating, toggle bars powered by an external motive force. The "flipping" of the toggle bars alternately place the north and south poles of the magnet couples in close proximity to the permanent magnets on the wheel. By synchronizing the toggling of the fixed magnets, alternate north and south poles attract oncoming, rotating wheel magnets. By controlling the speed of the toggling, the rotational speed of the wheel may be controlled.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,600,191 (Pat "191) for "Driving Assembly for Motor Wheels" (Inventor: Chen-Chi Yang, February 4, 1997) teaches another apparatus for magnetically imparting rotary motion to a wheel. US Pat "191 uses permanent magnets radially arranged at the circumference of a stator (wheel) to interact with external electromagnet coils. A clutch mechanism is provided to selectively couple the rotary motion to an axle.<br>
In U.S. Pat. No. 5,719,458 (US Pat "458) for "Power Generator with Improved Rotor" (Inventor: Teruo Kawal, February 17, 1998) another apparatus for imparting rotary motion to a wheel is described. US Pat "458 utilizes an AC current, preferably three-phase AC, to energize electromagnets to create an alternating magnetic field which interacts with semicircular pole pieces on the perimeter of the wheel. The wheel reported in the US Pat "458 is itself a relatively complex magnetic structure. The system described in the US Pat "458 relies upon an alternating north-south pole arrangement to implement an attraction/repulsion mode of operation. US Pat 6,849,984 (US Pat "984) for "Magnetically driven wheel for use in radial/rotary propulsion system having an energy recovery feature" (Inventor: Raymond Joseph Gallant, February 1, 2005) utilizes a DC, capacitive discharge system to selectively energize the electromagnets which interact with concentric circles of permanent magnets, all having the same polarity within any given magnet ring, the inventive system operating in a repulsion only mode. Also, unlike the US Pat "458 pole pieces, the permanent magnets of the US Pat "984 need have no special physical shape.<br>
While in each one of these prior art inventions, self-propelled magnetically driven machine is described, none of the above prior art, taken either singly or in combination, is seen to describe the instant invention as claimed. These facts are corroborated when one read the following description with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
3. SUMMARY AND OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, there is a need to design a self-propelled magnetically driven machine which will be used as a support to any prime movers for engines.

The other objects, preferred embodiments and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following description when read in conjunction with accompanying drawings which are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>

The objectives and other advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed out in description and claims hereof as well as accompanying drawings.<br>
4. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
A more complete understanding of the present embodiments and advantages thereof may be acquired by referring to the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference numbers indicate like features, and wherein:<br>
Figure 1 depicts one embodiment of the self-propelled magnetically driven machine wherein a mechanical momentum has been illustrated when the machine is in action;<br>
Figure 1 depicts another embodiment of the self-propelled magnetically driven machine wherein another type of mechanical momentum has been illustrated when the machine is in action; and<br>
Figure 3 illustrates a typical placement of the rotors and the stators with permanent magnets of the self-propelled magnetically driven machine.<br>
5. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS WITH REFERENCE TO THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the self-propelled magnetically driven machine is now described with reference to the accompanying drawings. The said machine elements are placed inside a machine housing (1). This house gives a strong support to the whole machine by rigidly fixing the said machine to the base so that the motion does not get any obstruction due to misalignment of the elements while the said machine is in motion. A plurality of nuts and bolts (9, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23) are required to firmly fasten the elements of the said machine. The said machine is having at least two rotors (2, 15). A plurality number of permanent magnets are placed in a pre-determined orientation on the inside periphery of the said rotors (2, 15) to use the magnetic forces during rotation of the mechanical capacitor. At least two stators (3, 10) are placed in parallel direction to that of the said rotors (2, 15). This forms an affection force when a plurality number of permanent magnets (6, 7, 11, 14) are positioned on the said rotors (2, 15). The mechanical energy for future use is stored in a mechanical capacitor (4). The term "future" is relative to the instantaneous movement of the said rotors (2, 15) and shafts (17, 20). A pulley (5) is placed on one of the shafts (17, 20) for receiving the rotational motion from a source positioned outside of the housing (1) of the said machine. At least two shafts (17, 20) are arranged in parallel to transmit the motion during machine-in-action condition. Two bull gears (12, 16) are mounted on the said two shafts (17, 20). These bull gears (12, 16) are of same size. The tooth profile and number of teeth of the said gears (12, 16) are identical. Each of the said bull gear is meshed with each of the pinion of a set of pinion (8, 13) for transmission of the power received through the said shafts (17, 20).<br>
Transmission ratio of the motion transmitted during the machine-in-action is a predetermined value.<br>
A plurality number of permanent magnets (6, 7, 11, 14) (in even numbers) are placed on the internal periphery of the said rotors (2, 15) and stators (3, 10). One may use eight rows of the said magnet for an example. The orientation of at least first pair of the said permanent magnet (6, 11) is made in a fashion such that the said first pair of the magnet (6, 11) is placed in opposite direction to that of the second pair of the magnet (7, 14).<br>
Continuous magnetic forces developed among the set of the arranged magnets placed in a single row should be restricted to achieve the goal of the instant invention. Thus, a plurality number of segmented casings made of non-magnetic materials are placed over the said set of magnets to cover the said rows of permanent magnets (6, 7, 11, 14). On the other hand, the said casings allow the other row in building magnetic forces during pulling or shoving the said rotor in the same direction.<br>
The capacitor (4) achieves rotation selectively at variable angular momentums and speeds solely through repulsive forces of the pairs of permanent magnets (6, 7, 11, 14) and induced inertia of the said mechanical capacitor (4). The pulling and shoving forces drive the said capacitor (4) in the same direction. The said pulling and shoving forces do not act simultaneously on the said capacitor (4), both the forces act on the said capacitor (4) one after another. The said rotors (2, 15) are disconnected from the said stators (3, 10) to stop the said machine.<br>
Many modifications and other embodiments of the inventions set forth herein will come to mind to one skilled-in-the-art to which these inventions pertain having the benefit of teachings presented in the foregoing descriptions and the associated drawings. Therefore, it is to be understood that the inventions are not to be limited to the specific embodiments disclosed and that modifications and other embodiments are intended to be included within the scope of the appended claims. Although specific terms are employed herein, they are used in a generic and descriptive sense only and not for purpose of limitation.<br>
While the principles of this invention have been described in connection with specific embodiment, it should be understood clearly that these descriptions are made only by way of example and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
