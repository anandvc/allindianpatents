				<td>Substituted organopolvsiloxanes and use thereof<br>
The invention relates to new organopolysiloxanes and their use for example as heterogeneous catalysts, catalyst supports, cation and anion exchangers, organic and inorganic compound scavengers, solid phase purification or extraction materials, immobilisation materials for bio-molecules, anti-microbial agents, hydrophilicity modifiers, flameproofing agents, antistatic agents, coatings for biomedical devices, water repellent films and coatings, solid phase synthesis materials and chromatography materials. The invention also relates to precursors of these new products and processes for their production.<br>
The use of functionalised solids is growing rapidly for many different applications such as solution phase synthesis, solid phase synthesis, solid phase extraction, catalysis, catalyst supports, product purification and the immobilisation of bio-molecules. In these applications the advantages of functionalised solids are ease of manipulation, simple separation from the rest of the medium by filtration and regeneration and reuse. Key requirements for these functionalised solids are excellent physical and chemical stability over a wide range of operating conditions, broad solvent applicability, fast kinetics - fast and easy access to the functional groups and functional groups with high intrinsic activity for the desired application. In addition the preparation of these functionalised materials has to be simple from readily available reagents. Finally it is highly advantageous if the functional groups can be readily transformed into different functionalised materials that can be used for other applications.<br>
As a consequence of stricter environmental regulations there is a growing requirement for more effective systems for the removal and recovery of toxic and hazardous chemicals from many sources including a wide spectrum of contaminated products, active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), solvents, potable water and aqueous based wastes and from contaminated waters. For example the electronics industry has a particular need for ultra pure water with very low levels of both cations and anions. Other industries such as the nuclear industry and the electroplating industry generate substantial quantities of water-based effluent that are heavily contaminated with undesirable metal ions. In the pharmaceutical industry metal catalysts are increasing being used in the manufacture of APIs or their intermediates. Given the toxicity of these metals very low residual levels have to be achieved in the API. In the preparation of compound libraries for biological evaluation simple and quick processes are required to purify reaction mixtures in order to screen thousands of compounds to identify leads for optimisation and development programmes.<br>
Substituted polystyrene derivatives are an important class of materials being used for a range of applications. The chemical and physical properties of a variety of such polystyrene based systems are<br><br>
described in the Bio-Rad Life Science Research Products catalogue 1998/99, pages 56-64. However the physical and chemical properties of these polystyrene resins may possess disadvantages, for example poor chemical stability and thermal stability, believed to be due to the organic polymeric backbone. Additional problems for example swelling and shrinking in organic solvents as well as the production of highly coloured unwanted side products may also be encountered. Generally, due to then- poor thermal stability, these polystyrene resins cannot be used for any length of time above 80°C, thus limiting their general applicability. In addition a range of chemical functionality cannot be readily attached to these organic polymers due to the physical limitations of these polymers and the range of chemistry that can be used to attache* functional groups onto the aromatic rings.<br>
Inorganic polymer systems such as silica, aluminium oxide and titanium oxide have also been disclosed as functionalised materials. Active functional groups or metals can be attached by a variety of means to these systems. However a number of problems may be encountered where the functional groups are only physically adsorbed for example low functional group loading along with limitations in the range of solvents that can be used and removal of the functional groups on use or on standing. This is believed to be due to the rather weak attachment between the functional group and the surface atoms on the support. Building the functional group into the framework may provide a more robust material and may also permit higher functional group loadings. However in this approach there is a significant lack of readily available starting materials as well as precursors for preparing such starting materials. In addition there are limited synthetic methodologies for the preparation of suitable starting materials from available precursors. A need exists to provide new synthetic methods as well as starting compounds in order to make such functionalised materials.<br>
Functionalised solid materials are used in solution phase organic synthesis to aid rapid purification<br>
i<br>
and workup. These materials, also known as scavengers, may remove excess reagents and side products. Typically, a scavenger is added to a solution to quench and selectively react with excess or unreacted reagents and reaction side products. The unwanted chemicals now attached to the functionalised materials are removed by simple filtration. This simple process circumvents the standard purification methodologies of liquid-liquid extraction, chromatography and crystallisation. Substituted polystyrene derivatives are known for use as scavengers but have a number of limitations such as lack of thermal stability, swelling and shrinking in organic solvents and a limited range of functional groups.<br>
In solid phase synthesis substituted polystyrene derivatives are the main class of materials being used and likewise these materials suffer the same limitations as described above. The use of functionalised silica materials for this application is limited by the availability of suitable functionalised materials.<br><br>
Due to their toxicity there is a growing requirement for more effective systems for the removal and recovery of cations and anions including a wide spectrum of contaminated products, active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), solvents, potable water and aqueous based wastes and from contaminated waters. Polymers having an organic, partly cross-linked polystyrene backbone with sulfonate groups attached to some of the phenyl rings are known for use as cation exchangers for removing metal ions from solution. The physical and chemical stability and other properties of these materials for example due to the organic nature of the polymeric backbone, may adversely affect their use in cation exchange applications. Organophosphonic acid cation exchangers have also been reported in US 5,281,631 and US 5,449,462. The feedstock in the manufacture of these materials may be expensive and they have limited applicability due to their physical and chemical properties.<br>
Strong acidic cation exchangers based on sulfonic acid groups attached to a organopolysiluxane backbone have been described in US 4,552,700 and US 5,354,831. The reported materials have a general formula of (O^Si—R1—S(V)xMx where R1 is an alkyl or cycloalkyl fragment, M is hydrogen or a mono to tetravalent metal ion and where the free valences of the oxygen atoms being saturated by silicon atoms of other groups of this formula and/or by cross-linking bridge members such as SiO^, R'SiO^ TiO^, AlOa/2. etc. Whilst these materials can act as cation exchangers it is generally recognised that sulfonic acid groups are limited in their effectiveness to complex with a range of metals and in comparison to other functional groups. In addition the sulfonate group is also limited by the fact that it is a mono anion and thus more of these functional groups are needed to bind to di and multivalent metal ions compared to other functional groups. These materials are also expensive to prepare. In our earlier patent application PCT/GB 0200069 we reported on organopolysiloxanes containing phosphonic groups. These materials demonstrate high intrinsic activity for the removal of metal ions. A range of other functionalised materials is needed particularly to separate specific metal ions from various environments. .<br>
Anions such as arsenates, chromates, permanganates, borates and perchlorates pose many significant problems to the environment and health. For example arsenates, chromates and permanganates are highly toxic and so their concentrations in water or other medium has to be very carefully controlled. New materials with very high affinity for such anions are needed in order to achieve very low acceptable limits.<br>
Precious metal mediated reactions enable the organic chemist to conduct a wide range of reactions used in the manufacture of products for a number of industries. Typical reactions include Suzuki, Heck, oxidations and reductions and metals and their complexes such as platinum, palladium and rhodium are extensively used. A major problem encountered with the use of these systems is the significant loss of these expensive and highly toxic metals. Furthermore in the production of active<br><br>
pharmaceutical agents (APIs) using such metal mediated reactions, it is found that the metal invariably complexes to the desired API and residual metal contents in the range of 600-1000 ppm are not uncommon. The current target for palladium, platinum, rhodium and nickel is less than 5 ppm. Various methods have been tried to reduce the residual palladium content, most unsuccessfully. Selective re-crystallisation leads to only a slight lowering of metal content. A lower yield of the API is a significant unwanted side effect of this process. Attempts to reposition the precious metal catalysed reaction from the final to an earlier step leads also to a slight but not significant lowering of metal content. Attempts to pass a solution of the API through a medium containing a metal exchanger such as a functionalised polystyrene resin have also been largely unsuccessful. Alternative and more costly processes have been tried - washing with an aqueous solution of a suitable metal chelator. A number of such reagents have been used with only limited success. Thus there is a need to design new functionalised materials that have very high affinity for precious metals and can readily remove them from tightly bound complexes. Furthermore given the structural diversity of APIs it is necessary to have a range of functionalised materials with different structures and high affinity in order to provide an effective solution.<br>
Catalysts are utilised in the chemical and biochemical industry to conduct a wide range of chemical transformations. A range of homogenous and heterogeneous catalysts are used some of which require high temperatures to be effective and some produce considerable amount of bi-products and waste. These unwanted products and waste have to be treated and destroyed. The drive for more environmentally friendly processes - Green Chemistry - highlights the need for reusable, more effective and selective catalysts. Examples of such reagents currently used extensively across manufacturing industries include mineral acids — sulphuric acid, hydrochloric acid, hydrogen fluoride, phosphoric acid - Lewis acids — aluminium trichloride, boron trifluoride and zinc chloride — and oxidation reagents - permanganate, manganese dioxide and chromium.(VI). This need has led to investigations into the design of new solid phase materials that can catalyse a variety of chemical transformations. Key requirements for such new catalysts are very good thermal stability, high insensitivity to chemical attack, high and tailored functional group loading, fixed and rigid structures, optimum functional groups so as to avoid rearrangements and side products, limited swelling capability, insolubility hi organic solvents, ease of purification and high reusability, high ageing resistance and ease of access to the functional group which conducts the chemical transformation. A particular requirement for acid catalysed reactions is to have suitable functional groups attached to an inert support that possess the right level of acidity to catalyse the desired reaction without producing a range of side products and highly discoloured products. For example, whilst both sulfuric acid and heterogeneous sulfonic acids are effective acid catalysts they also invariable produce a range of highly coloured unwanted side products that have to be removed. Further requirements are for<br><br>
heterogeneous oxidation catalysts as well as for carbon carbon bond formation that do not leach the metal ions into the products or waste streams.<br>
The inventors have discovered a class of compounds which have a desirable combination of characteristics and make them suitable for use in a range of applications including acting as scavengers for inorganic and organic compounds, solid phase purification or extraction materials, ion exchange materials, catalysts, catalyst immobilisation supports, immobilisation materials for bio-molecules, anti-microbial agents, hydrophilicity modifiers, flameproofing agents, antistatic agents, solid phase synthesis materials and chromatography materials, or which are precursors for these.<br>

Advantages of the new scavengers for inorganic and organic compounds, solid phase extraction or purification materials, catalysts, catalyst immobilisation supports, bio-molecule immobilisation supports, anti-microbial agents, hydrophilicity modifiers, flameproofing agents, antistatic agents, solid phase synthesis materials and chromatography materials, and ion exchanger materials based on compounds of Formula 1 include high intrinsic activity of particular functional groups for specific applications and that the functional group or groups can be tuned to have either a high or low level of loading according to the requirements of the user. Other advantages include high thermal stability, fixed and rigid structures, good stability to a wide range of chemical conditions, insolubility in organic solvents, high resistance to ageing, easily purified and high reusability.   In addition the processes for the preparation of compounds of Formula 1 are very flexible, allowing a wide range of functionalised materials to be made from a small number of common intermediates and also the porosity of the materials can be varied from micro to macro porous and the loading of the functional groups as well as the other substituents in the fragment V to be varied as needed.  Compounds of Formula 1 have the added advantage of their respective functional groups being firmly attached to a very stable and inert medium. Furthermore compounds of Formula 1 have the added advantages of a very high affinity for both cations and anions coupled with fast kinetics thus enabling very rapid removal of toxic compounds or impurities to very low levels. In addition compounds of Formula 1 can be used as heterogeneous catalysts to conduct a number of chemical transformations and posses the key advantages of being easily separated from the reaction mixture by filtration and also of being recycled and reused.<br>

Where an end group and/or cross linker and or polymer chain is used, it is preferred that the ratio of end groups or cross linker or polymer chains to a+b+c+d varies from 0 to 99:1, preferably 0.01 to 99:1. Particularly suitable cross linkers or polymer chains are derived from titanium alkoxides, aluminium trialkoxides and alkyl alkoxy silanes. Examples of cross linkers include aluminium triethoxide, aluminium tributoxide and titanium isopropoxide and for polymer chains alkyl alkoxy silanes. The end group, cross linking bridge or polymer chain member is preferably R83M'Oi/2, R82SiO R9Oi/2, (R8)2SiO2/2S TiO^, R^iOaa, (R^TiO^, AlO3/2 or R8AlO2/2. R8 and R9 are preferably Ci-4-alkyl, especially methyl or ethyl.<br>
The preparation of compounds of Formula 1 will now be discussed in greater detail. The general procedure used for the production of the compounds of Formula 1 comprises first forming the compounds (R9O)3SiCH2(CH2)tS(CR1R2)fX and depending on the reagents and reaction conditions (R9O)3SiCH2(CH2)tS(CR1R2){S(CH2)tCH2Si(OR9)3 as well and then combining the former and the latter if present with tetraalkyl orthosilicate and with other compounds such as (R5O&gt;3SiV, titanium alkoxides, aluminium trialkoxides and alkyl alkoxy silanes, in the desired ratios, in solvent with either dilute acid or base. Alternatively the surfaces of materials such as silica, aluminium oxide or carbon can be treated with (R^SiCH^CH^SCCR'R^fX or mixtures of (R9O)3SiCH2(CH2),S(CR1R2)fX and (R9O)3SiCH2(CH2),S(CRIR2){S(CH2)tCH2Si(OR9)3 and if necessary with other compounds such as<br>
(R5O)3SiV, titanium alkoxides, aluminium trialkoxides and alkyl alkoxy silanes to give compounds of Formula 1. These materials can then be subsequently transformed using known chemistry.<br>
There is a lack of simple and effective synthetic methodology for the preparation of functionalised organic or inorganic polymers or materials. For example there is a lack of simple and effective synthetic methodology for the preparation of readily transformed carbonyl, carboxy, thio or hydroxy functionalised organic or inorganic polymers or materials. Given the advantages of inorganic materials such as high thermal stability, fast kinetics and greater solvent compatibility there is a particular need for new simple synthetic methodologies for the preparation of functionalised inorganic materials.<br>
An important desired property of functionalised materials is to be able to transform the functional group, attached to the surface via a stable bond, into different groups using known chemistry. These new functionalised materials can then be used for other applications or to optimise existing applications. A further advantage is that a wide range of different functionalised materials can be made from a limited number of intermediates. However a number of problems are encountered in the chemical transformation of surface attached functional groups. For example very long reaction times are often needed to conduct such chemical transformations of surface attached functional groups. These prolonged reaction conditions often result in the functional group being removed from the surface. In addition those reactions mat do proceed very often do not go to completion leading to a mixture of products that cannot be separated. To circumvent these difficulties the inventors designed these new functionalised materials with specific additional functionality to enhance the chemical reactivity of these materials. In addition the inventors believed that this design would enhance the properties of the materials for a number of desired applications. The design involved the use of a neighbouring group to enhance the reactivity of the second functional group.<br>
It is known that free radical reactions involving alkenes may not proceed in high yield or selectivity as, depending on the particular starting materials unwanted dimers and higher tellomers may undesirably be produced for example as disclosed in Org. Reactions, Vol.13, page 218 - 222 and the references provided therein. In the original 1950's work mono substituted products and not mixtures were the desired target for use as fine chemicals. As a consequence of these side reactions interest in this area of chemistry waned. It has been reported that sulfides can be prepared through the free radical addition of thiols to double bonds. This is described in Org. Reactions. Vol.13, 164 - 196. The majority of this work concerns the addition of thiols to simple alkyl substituted olefins. For silicon containing olefins there are a small number of examples that include the photochemical catalysed reaction of methyl thioglycolate with trimethoxy vinylsilane reported in J. Gen. Chem,, 1976, 46, 1013 to give (RO)3Si(CH2)2SCH2CO2R. These compounds were investigated for<br>
pharmacological activity in a programme on atrane derivatives. Also it has been reported in the Rws. J. Appl. Chem, 1999, 72, 610-612 that the radical catalysed reaction of thioglycolic acid, HSCH2CO2H, to trimethoxy vinylsilane gives a complex-mixture which on either acid or neutral treatment does not lead to a polymeric material. Strong base treatment followed by acidification was reported to give a polymeric material described as [Oi.sSi(CH2)2SCH2CO2H]n. The sodium salts of this polymer are capable of removing both silver and gold ions but are ineffective for other metal ions.<br>
Thus it was decided to explore the free radical addition of substituted thiols to vinyl trialkoxy silane to produce fimctionalised organopolysiloxanes with the desired physical and chemical properties for applications such as scavengers for the removal of unwanted chemical, as materials for solid phase synthesis, as materials for cation and anion recovery and removal, for solid phase purification and extraction, as catalysts and catalyst supports, as chromatography materials and for the immobilisation of bio-molecules.<br>
Compounds such as (R9O)3SiCH2CH2S(CR1R2)fX were synthesised via a free radical promoted addition of a thiol HS(CR!R2)fX to vinyl trialkoxy silane. R9 is a linear or branched Cuo-alky!, C2-4o-alkenyl or C^-alkynyl group, aryl or Cuo-alkylaryl group. A wide range of free radical initiators can be used for this reaction and preferred are the peroxides and in particular the alkyl peroxides. Addition of a very small amount of the initiator every few hours improves the overall yield. Reaction temperatures between 20-170°C can be used, though a reaction temperature of between 20-120°C is preferred. Di-/er/-butyl peroxide is the preferred free radical initiator. Reaction times of between 5 minutes to. 48 hours have been used with 1/2 to 2 hours preferred.<br>
Known sol-gel technology was used to produce the organopolysiloxanes of Formula 1. The state of the arts of sol-gel technology and the hydrolysis of silicon esters are described by M.A.Brook in Silicon in Organic, Organometallic and Polymer Chemistry Chapter 10, page 318, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2000, G.A. Scherer in Sol-gel science: the physics and chemistry of sol-gel processing, Boston: Academic Press, 1990, and J.D. Wright in Sol-gel materials: chemistry and applications, Amsterdam: Gordon &amp; Breach Science Publishers, 200land the references contained within. Acids and bases were used to catalyse the hydrolysis of the silicon esters of (R9O)3SiCH2CH2S(CR1R2)fX or mixtures of (R9O)3SiCH2CH2S(CR1R2)fX and (R9O)3SiCH2CH2S(CRIR2)(SCH2CH2Si(OR9)3 and if necessary with other compounds such as (R9O)3SiV, and tetraalkyl orthosilicate to produce the organopolysiloxanes of Formula 1.<br>
A range of solvents, well known to those skilled in the art of organic chemistry, can be used to conduct this reaction. Alcohols are the preferred solvents particularly methanol and ethanol. After<br>
standing for a period of time the solution can be warmed to speed up the formation of the glass. Ratios, by weight, of the alcohol solvent to the combined weight of the reagents from 100 to 0.01 can be used, with ranges from 2-10 being preferred. A range of acids can be used to aid hydrolysis with hydrochloric acid in concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 4 M being preferred. Hydrochloric acid, 1 molar, was routinely used. Ratios, from 0.000001 to 10, of hydrochloric acid, 1 molar, to the combined weight of the reagents can be used, with ranges from 0.0001 to 1 being preferred. Tn general the reaction mixture was left to stand at temperatures ranging from 0°C-120°C to aid hydrolysis and the formation of the Si-O-Si bonds. Temperatures between 20°C-90°C are preferred and warming is continued until all the solvent has evaporated and a clear glass is obtained.<br>
In addition to the groups A, B, C and D, end groups, cross-linking bridge members or polymer chains such as (R8)3SiOi/2 or R8SiOOT or (R^SiO^ or TiO4a or R^iO^ or (R^TiO^ or AlOs/z or R8AlC&gt;2/2, where R8 is as defined above, but is preferably methyl or ethyl, or other oxo metals can be added in varying ratios to produce the desired compound of Formula 1. These end groups, cross linking bridge or polymer chain precursors are added at the same time as compounds (R'O^SiCHbCH^CR'R^fX, or mixtures of (R'OfcSiCHjCHzSCCR'R^fX and (R9O)3SiCH2CH2S(CR1R2)jSCH2CH2Si(OR9)3 and tetraalkyl orthosilicate and (R9O)3SiV.<br>
Compounds of Formula 1 can also be prepared by treating a preformed material such as silica or aluminium oxide or carbon with (R9O)3SiCH2CH2S(CR1R2)fX or a mixture of (R'OJaSiCHzCHzS^R'R^fX and (R^SiCHzCHzSCCR^^fSCHjCHjSiCOR^.and with (R9O)3SiV if required, and with other end groups, cross linkers or polymers chains if required, in varying ratios in a solvent At the end of the reaction the solid is filtered off and washed extensively with solvents such as water or alcohols to remove any remaining starting materials.<br>
A further advantage of the processes is that based on a small number of intermediates a wide range of compounds of Formula 1 can be prepared. For example the esters (R9O)3SiCH2CH2S(CH2)fC(O)OMe are important intermediates leading via simple processes to a wide range of different structures for different applications. This common intermediate is prepared in a simple process involving a free radical reaction between vinyl trialkoxysilane and readily available thiol esters such as methyl thioglycolate or methyl 3-thiopropionate to give (CH3O)3SiCH2CH2S(CH2)jC(O)OMe. The next step involves either a sol gel process between these esters and tetraethyl orthosilicate or coating the surface of preformed materials such as silica to give compounds of Formula 1 where W is oxygen and R is methoxy. These ester compounds of Formula 1 can be readily transformed into a wide range of derivatives. Acid or base hydrolysis of these ester of Formula 1 affords the corresponding acid [OwSiCH2CH2S(CH2)fC(O)OH]a[O4/2Si]c where the ratio of a to c depends on the relative concentrations of (CH3O)3SiCH2CH2S(CH2)C(O)OMe and tetraethyl orthosilicate in the sol gel step<br>
or silica in the coating process. Metal salts of Formula 1, useful for heterogeneous metal mediated catalysis, can be readily prepared via standard synthetic methodologies from these carboxylic acids. Other derivatives such as amides, hydrazides and other esters can similarly be prepared by treatment of this ester of Formula 1 with the corresponding amines, hydrazines or alcohols in a solvent. At the end of the reaction the new derivative of Formula 1 can be easily purified through simple filtration from the reaction medium. As a consequence of the presence of the second functional group, sulfur, close to the carbonyl group these reactions proceed to completion with short reaction times usually one to two hours. Without this neighbouring group effect these reactions do not go to completion even after prolonged reaction times.<br>
In this way the hydrazide of Formula 1 where W is oxygen and R is NHNHj as well as amides and polyamine derivatives of Formula 1 where W is oxygen and R is NH(CH2)3N(CH3)2 or R NH(CH2)2N(CH2)2NH2 or NH(CH2)2(N(CH2)2NH)iH where lis an integer between 2 and 40, or the esters of Formula 1 where W is oxygen and R is O(CH2)2OH or O(CH2)2O(CH2CHjO)jH where j is an integer between 2 and 20,000 were prepared.<br>
Compounds of Formula 1 where X is CHR3Z or (CR3Z)iCHR3Z where Z is OR6, NR*R7 or SR6 and R3, R*and R7 are each independently hydrogen, a linear or branched Ci^o-alkyl, C2-4o-alkenyl or €2-40-alkynyl group, an aryl or Ci^-alkylaryl group; and i is an integer from 1 to 6 are similarly prepared by a two step process. The first step is a free radical reaction between a thiol and trimethoxy vinyl silane followed either by a sol gel or coating process described above. For example a free radical reaction involving thioglycerol and trimethoxy vinyl silane gives (CH3O)3SiCH2CH2SCH2CHOHCH2OH which on sol gel with tetraethyl orthosilicate gave compounds of Formula 1 where i =1, R3 = H and Z = OR Another example is the free radical reaction . between 2-mercaptoethanol and trimethoxyvinyl silane tq give (CHsO^SiCHbCHbSCI^CHbOH which on sol gel with tetraethyl orthosilicate gave compounds of Formula 1 where i =1, R3 = H and Z = OH. Alternatively a preformed material such as silica or aluminium oxide can be treated with (CfyO^SiCHaCHzSC^CHOHC^OH or (CH3O)3SiCH2CH2SCH2CH2OH in a solvent such as toluene, xylene or other aromatic or water . At the end of the reaction the solid is filtered off and washed extensively with solvents such as water or alcohols to remove any remaining starting materials.<br>
Substituted ether derivatives of Formula 1 where h is zero, R3 = H and X is OR6 can readily be prepared from the corresponding hydroxy compound of Formula 1 where X is OH, an alcohol and a homogeneous acid catalyst. For example treatment of the hydroxy compound of Formula 1 where e, i, h, b, d is zero, R3 =» H; f is 2; X is OH with 1- butanol or octafluoro-pentan-1-ol in the presence of an acid catalyst gave the corresponding ether where R6 is butyl or CsFgHs in quantitative yield.<br>
Compounds of Formula 1 where B is present involve the use of the bisthiol HS(CR'R2)fSH. The<br>
mixture of (R'O^SiCHzCHaSCCRR^fSH and (R9O)3SiCH2CH2S(CRR1),SCH2CH2Si(OR')3 was<br>
synthesised via a free radical promoted addition of a thiol HS(CR'R2)fSH to vinyl trialkoxy silane.<br>
For example compounds (CH3O)3SiCH2CH2S(CH2)3SCH2CH2Si(CKDH3)3	and<br>
(CH3O)3SiCH2CH2S(CH2)3SH were synthesised via a free radical promoted addition of HS(CH2)3SH to vinyl trimethoxy silane. The ratio of the products follows from the ratio of the reactants. *H and 13C nmr spectroscopy was used to identify both compounds in the mixture. In the !H spectrum run in CDC13 signals at 8 0.92, 1.77 and 2.55 correspond to the SiCH2, CCH2C and CH2SCH2 protons of (CH3O)3SiCH2CH2S(CH2)3SH whilst signals at 8 0.93, 1.81 and 2.58 correspond to the SiCH2, CCH2C and CH2SCH2 protons of (CH3O)3SiCH2CH2S(CH2)3SCH2CH2Si(OCH3)3. Sol gel or coating processes described above involving (R'O^SiCKbCHaSCCRR'^H and (R9O)3SiCH2CH2S(CRR1)fSCH2CH2Si(OR9)3 give the corresponding materials of Formula 1 where A, B and C are present, e is 0 and h is 1 and X is H.<br>
Substituted phenyl sulfonic acid catalysts of Formula 1 can be prepared hi a simple three-step process. The first step involves the formation of (R9O)3SiCH2CH2SR via reaction of the corresponding thiol RSH with vinyl trialkoxy silane. Sol gel or coating processes using (R9O)3SiCH2CH2SR men affords compounds of Formula 1 where e and h are zero. Treatment of these products where R is phenyl or benzyl with concentrated sulphuric acid gave the corresponding phenyl sulfonic acid.<br>
Sulfonic acid compounds of Formula 1 where.e is 2 and h is 1 and X is OH can be prepared via oxidation of compounds of Formula 1 where e is 0, h is 1 and X is H.<br>
Templates to aid the preparation of pores with particular sizes and distributions in compounds of Formula 1 can be added at the sol gel stage. On preparation of the solid organopolysiloxane of Formula 1 these templates can be washed out using known methods.<br>
Compounds of Formula 1 may be linked to a metal complex, for example as a ligand. A further aspect of the invention provides a Compound of Formula 1 further comprising a metal complex M(L)j where M is derived from a lanthanide, actinide, main group or transition metal with oxidation states ranging from zero to four and L is one or more optionally substituted ligands selected from halide, nitrate, acetate, carboxylate, cyanide, sulfate, carbonyl, imine, alkoxy, triaryl or trialkylphosphine and phenoxy and j is an integer from 0 to 8 and where the compound of Formula 1 is linked to the said metal complex.<br>
Suitably, M is derived from cobalt, manganese, iron, nickel, palladium, platinum, rhodium, with oxidation states ranging from zero to four and L is one or more optionally substituted Hgands selected from halide, nitrate, acetate, carboxylate, cyanide, sulfate, carbonyl, imine, alkoxy, triaryl or trialkylphosphine and phenoxy and j is an integer from 0 to 4.<br>
Compounds of Formula 1 have a wide range of uses. The present invention provides a process for<br>
treating a feed material comprising contacting a compound of Formula 1 with a feed material:<br>
i) to effect a chemical reaction by catalytic transformation of a component of the feed material to<br>
produce a desired product;<br>
ii) to remove a component of the feed material so as to produce a material depleted in the removed<br>
component; or<br>
iii) to remove an ionic species in the feed material in an ion exchange process.<br>
The feed material may be a continuous stream for example a continuous process reaction feedstock, or may be in the form of a batch of material for discrete treatment. The feed material, for example a waste water or waste process stream, may be treated to selectively remove a components of the feed. The removed component may be an undesirable material in the feed and the process acts to provide a desired composition for the feed material that has been depleted in the selectively removed component after contact with compounds of Formula 1. This process may be used for example in removing unwanted species from a feed material in a pharmaceutical manufacturing or formulation process to improve the purity level of the pharmaceutical product as regards the removed material, for example metal species.<br>
The process may be employed to remove desired species from a feed material for subsequent processing or analysis, for example, a biological molecule such as an enzyme, peptide, protein and nucleic acid may be removed from a feed material to enable further processing or analysis of the removed components.<br>
As a consequence of stricter environmental regulations there is a growing requirement for more effective systems for the removal and recovery of cations and anions from a wide spectrum of contaminated solvents, aqueous based wastes and from contaminated waters and contaminated products and Pharmaceuticals. Compounds of Formula 1 are very effective at abstracting a wide range of cations and anions from various environments. For cations these include the lanthanides, actinides, main group and transition metals. Anions include arsenates, borates, chromates, permanganates and perchlorates.<br>
Compounds of Formula 1 were designed to have very high affinity for ions and thus be able to remove them from various environments. Such high affinity is required when metal ions are tightly bound to particular functional groups for example in highly polar active pharmaceutical ingredients. The design of compounds of Formula 1 for these applications involves the presence of two or more different ligands to bind strongly to the ion. Depending on the ion to be removed the ligands are designed to be either soft or hard or a combination of both in order to optimise the affinity of the functionalised material for the ion. Furthermore the compounds of Formula 1 have been designed with easily modified functional groups in order to simply find the optimum combination of ligands for specific ion impurities.<br>
For example the products from Examples 13,17, 19, 22-26, 30-32, and 43 are very effective for the removal of cupric (II) ions from various solutions. Ferrous and ferric ions present in hydro-processing streams are readily removed using the products from Examples 13 and 43.<br>
Compounds of Formula 1 can also remove precious metals such as palladium, platinum and rhodium ion as well as nickel (0) and nickel (II) from various different solutions and also bound to functional groups commonly found in active pharmaceutical ingredients such as amides, amines and carboxylic acids. For example treatment of a palladium acetate solution in tetrahydrofuran or dichloromethane with any of the products from Examples 13,17,19,22-26,30-32, and 41,45,47, 49 and 51-54 results in the complete removal of the palladium ions from solution. For solutions containing bis(triphenylphosphine) palladium chloride or acetate, the products from Examples 13,17,19,22-26, 30-32, and 41, 45, 47, 49 and 51-54 are equally effective for its removal. The products from Examples 13, 17, 19, 22-26, 30-32, and 41, 45, 47, 49 and 51-54 are effective for the removal of chlorotris(triphenylphosphine) rhodium(I) from various solutions. The products from Examples 13, 17, 19,22-26, 30-32, and 41, 45, 47, 49 and 51-:54 are effective for the removal of platinum chloride from various solutions. Rhodium (HI) is readily removed from various solutions using any of the products from Examples 13, 17, 19, 22-26,30-32, and 41,45,47,49 and 51-54.<br>
Given their respective catalytic cycles the precious metals are often present in waste steams, solutions or bound to products in more than one oxidation state. Compounds of Formula 1, such as the amides formed in Examples 17, 25, 26 and 31-32 and the sulfides formed in Examples 41,45,47, 49 and 51-54 can scavenge these precious metals in their different oxidation states.<br>
Compounds of Formula 1 can be used, as scavengers, to remove excess inorganic or organic reagents and side products from reactions mixtures or from impure chemical products. In these applications impurities are removed by matching functionality contained in these impurities with specific functionalised materials. For example the sulfonic acid or carboxylic acid materials prepared in<br><br>
Example 65 and 12 respectively can readily remove amines and hydrazines as well as other basic reagents including hydrides from reaction mixtures. The hydrazide and amine prepared in Examples 18 and 17 respectively can remove acids, isocyanates, acid chlorides, aldehydes, sulfonyl halides and chloroformates. The diol prepared in Example 8 can scavenge boronic acids as well as aldehydes and ketones. The following examples illustrate the scavenging of unwanted organic and inorganic compounds by compounds of Formula 1 but are not intended to limit the scope of their capability. Treatment of solutions containing amines such as benzylamine, hexylamine and 3-methoxypropylamine with 2 to 4 equivalents of an organopolysiloxane carboxylic acid of Formula 1 at room temperature for 1 hour led to the complete removal of the amine. Excess borohydrides such as sodium borohydride can be removed on treatment with the organopolysiloxane carboxylic acid of Formula 1. Toluene sulfonyl chloride, benzoyl chloride and phenyl isocyanate are readily removed using the amides from Examples 17,25,26 and 31 and 32.<br>
Unlike the polystyrene based scavengers, organopolysiloxane compounds of Formula 1 can work in all solvents and are not limited hi their application to reaction temperatures below 80°C. In addition compounds of Formula 1 do not suffer from swelling and possess the significant advantage of very fast kinetics compared to organic polymers.<br>
Compounds of Formula 1 where i) b, e and h are zero and X is a substituted phenyl sulfonic acid and ii) h is 1 and X is OH are especially beneficial in catalysing a wide range of acid promoted reactions. For examples these compounds readily catalyse the condensation between aldehydes and aldehydes, aldehydes and ketones and ketones with ketones, reactions known as the Aldol condensation and the Claisen-Schmidt reaction. In addition these compounds catalyse esterification, trans-esterification, acylation, alkylation, cyclisation, etherification, dehydration and rearrangement reactions as well as a variety of protection and de-protection reactions. In addition these compounds of Formula 1 possess good thermal and chemical stability and reactions can be catalysed at much higher temperatures than functionalised polystyrene materials. One of the advantages of these catalysts is that on completion of the reaction they can be simply filtered off and reused. No apparent loss of activity was observed. Following filtration and washing with solvents such as acetone, alcohols, water and others well known to those skilled in the art of organic chemistry and drying at temperatures ranging from 20°C-120°C under reduced pressure the compounds of Formula 1 can be used to catalyse other reaction types without apparent loss of activity.<br>
The following examples illustrate the catalytic activity of compounds of Formula 1 but are not intended to limit the scope of their capability to catalyse a wide range of reactions. Compounds of Formula 1, where i) b, e and h are zero and X is a substituted phenyl sulfonic acid and ii) h is 1 and X is OH, catalyse the esterification of carboxylic acids. For example treatment of oleic acid in refluxing<br><br>
ethanol with such compounds of Formula 1 gave the ester, ethyl oleate, in quantitative yield. These compounds also catalyse the trans-esterification of carboxylate esters. For example treatment of ethyl oleate in butanol at temperatures between 60-140°C with these catalysts gives colourless butyl oleate. Utilising known reaction conditions compounds of Formula 1, particularly where i) b, e and h are zero and X is a substituted phenyl sulfonic acid and ii) h is 1 and X is OH, readily catalyse the ketalisation of ketones in very high yields and purity.<br>
Metal salt/complexes of Formula 1 can catalyse a wide range of reactions well known to practitioners of organic and inorganic chemistry. Examples include but not limited to oxidations, (eductions, alkylations, carbon-carbon bond formation, polymerisations, hydroformylations, arylations, acylations, isomerisations, alkylations, carboxylations, carbonylations, esterifications, trans-esterifications and rearrangements. These organopolysiloxane compounds of Formula 1 have many advantages for example they possess good thermal and chemical stability and broad solvent compatibility. One of the advantages of these catalysts is that on completion of the reaction they can be simply filtered off and reused. No apparent loss of activity was observed. Thus an important application of the metal derivatives of Formula 1 is their use as heterogeneous catalysts.<br>
Compounds of Formula 1 where i) X is independently selected from R1, C(=W)R or (CR3Z)jCHR3Z where W is selected from oxygen, sulfur, NR4 or NNR4R5 and Z is selected from OR6, NR*R7 or SR6 and R is R6, OR6, O(M**)Ve&gt; NR6R7, NHNR6R7 or SR6 where R1'7 are as designed above and M is a metal ion derived from a lanthanide, actinide, main group or transition metal, or ii) metal complexes M(L)j of i) are especially beneficial in catalysing a wide range of metal promoted reactions. For example palladium (IT) complexes of compounds of Formula 1 where i) e and h are zero, X. is C(=W)R where R is O" or NR6R7 and W is oxygen or sulfur, or ii) e and h are zero, X is H catalyse a wide range of carbon-carbon bond formation reactions such as Suzuki and. Heck reactions. At the end of these reactions these catalysts can be filtered easily from the reaction mixture and reused.<br>
Compounds of Formula 1 can also be used for solid phase synthesis through first attachment of the starting material to groups such as X or Z. A number of chemical reactions can then be conducted and in each step purification is facile through simple filtration. At the end of the sequence the desired material is released from the solid phase. For example 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde was attached to the diol prepared in Example 8. Alkylation of the free hydroxyl group using standard methodologies gave an aryl, alkyl ether. The product was then released from the material to give pure 4-alkoxybenzaldehyde.<br>
In addition compounds of Formula 1 can be used as materials for solid phase extraction where a desired product is purified through selective retention on the functionalised materials whilst the<br><br>
impurities are removed. The desired material is then subsequently released using a different solvent system. For example amines can be retained on the acids prepared in Example 12 or 65 and the impurities are then washed out. Treatment of the material with a methanol solution containing ammonia releases the amine and after concentration the pure amine is obtained.<br>
Compounds of Formula 1 can also be used for the separation or removal of gases, including the removal of malodorous volatile organic compounds. For example the removal of malodorous amines can be achieved with acids prepared in Examples 65 o!2.<br>
Further applications of compounds of Formula 1 include the use as materials for chromatographic separations. For example the materials of Formula 1 can be used in the separation of amines, including optically active amines. Primary amines can be selectively separated from secondary amines using compounds of Formula 1.<br>
Compounds of Formula 1, containing optically active groups such as in the products formed in Examples 28 and 29, can be used as materials for chiral separation.<br>
Compounds of Formula 1 can be used as materials for gel filtration and high speed size-exclusion chromatography as well as for high pressure liquid chromatography and solid phase extraction.<br>
Compounds of Formula 1 can be used both to immobilise biological molecules such as enzymes, polypeptides, proteins and nucleic acids as well as for their separation and purification. In addition nucleic acids immobilised on compounds of Formula 1 can be used for conducting high volume nucleic acid hybridization assays.<br>
Compounds of Formula 1 can be used as anti-microbial agents. The invention also provides an antimicrobial composition comprising a compound of Formula 1 and a carrier.<br>
Compounds of Formula 1 can be applied as thin films onto a variety of surfaces.<br>
The invention will now be described in detail with reference to illustrative examples of the invention.<br>
