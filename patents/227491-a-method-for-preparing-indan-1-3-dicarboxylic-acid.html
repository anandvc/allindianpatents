A METHOD FOR PREPARING INDAN-1.3-DICARBOXYLIC ACID<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The present invention is directed to a method for preparing indan-1,3-dicarboxylic acid and derivatives thereof which are useful intermediates in the synthesis of aryl fused azapolycyclic compounds. United States Patent Application No. 09/514002 filed February 25, 2000 discloses the synthesis of selected intermediates which are useful in the preparation of aryl fused azapolycyclic compounds.<br>
The synthesis, composition, and methods of use of certain aryl fused azapolycyclic compounds which exhibit activity as agents for the treatment of neurological and psychological disorders is disclosed in United States Patent No. 6,410,550 B1. The foregoing patent application and patent are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides a process for preparing a compound of the formula<br>
(Figure Remove) <br>
wherein R1 and -R2 are independently selected from hydrogen, CrC5 alkyl, CrC5 alkoxy, trifluororhethyl, halogen, sulfonyl alkyl, alkylamino, amide, ester, aryl-alkyl, heteroalkyl, and arylalkoxy. The compounds of formula I are prepared by the acid or base catalyzed hydrolysis of a compound having the formula<br>
(Figure Remove) wherein R1 and R2 are selected independently from hydrogen, CrC5 alkyl, CrC6 alkoxy, trifluoromethyl, halogen, sulfonyl alkyl, alkylamino, amide, ester, aryl-alkyl, heteroalkyl, and arylalkoxy.<br>
Compounds of the formula II may be prepared by the hydrogenation of a compound of formula<br>
(Figure Remove) in the presence of a suitable hydrogenation catalyst, wherein R1 and R2 are as defined above. Compounds of formula III may be prepared by the reaction of a compound of formula<br>
with 3-ethoxyacrylonitrile, of formula<br><br>
  (Figure Remove) <br>
in the presence of palladium II acetate, tricyclohexylphosphine and a base in a water miscible solvent. R1 and R2 are as defined above and X is selected from the group consisting of chlorine, bromine, and iodine.<br>
The hydrolysis of the indan II to the corresponding dicarboxylic acid is conducted in the presence of either an acid catalyst or a base catalyst. The acid catalyst is comprised of either a single acid or a mixture of acids. Suitable acids are glacial acetic acid, concentrated hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid.<br>
Preferably the catalyst is a mixture of glacial acetic acid and concentrated hydrochloric acid. The hydrolysis is carried out at a temperature in the range of about 25°C to about 100°C for a period of about 1 hour to about 20 hours.<br>
Preferably the temperature is about 100°C for a period of about 2 hours.<br>
Under basic hydrolysis, the conditions of time and temperature are about the same as for acid hydrolysis. Suitable base catalysts include Group I metal alkoxides, sodium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, and potassium hydroxide.<br>
Generally, the hydrolysis reaction will include a suitable amount of water as is well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The hydrogenation of compound III may be conducted at a hydrogen pressure of about 14 psi to about 50 psi. Preferably the pressure is about 40 psi. Suitable hydrogenation catalysts include palladium on carbon, platinum on carbon, and Raney nickel. A preferred catalyst is 5% palladium on carbon.<br>
The synthesis of a compound of formula III is carried out by first condensing a compound of formula IV with 3-ethoxyacrylonitrile followed by ring closure, in situ, by the application of heat. The reaction is carried out in the presence of palladium II acetate, tricyclohexyl phosphine, a base, and a water miscible solvent.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the compound of formula I is indan -1,3-dicarboxylic acid. Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides a method for preparing indan-1,3-diacarboxylic acid and its derivatives according to Scheme 1. In the first step of the process, a compound of formula IV is condensed with 3-ethoxyacrylonitrile in the presence of palladium II acetate, tricyclohexylphosphine, and a base in a water miscible solvent. Initially, the intermediate dinitrile of formula IVa is formed, but not isolated. With the application of heat, the dinitrile of formula IVa is cyclized to a compound of formula III. The resulting indene dinitrile (111) is next hydrogenated to the corresponding indan compound II. Hydrolysis of a compound of formula II in the presence of an aqueous acid or base catalyst results in the formation of the dicarboxylic acid of formula I.<br>
(Figure Remove) <br>
wherein R1 and R2 are selected independently from hydrogen, CrC5 alkyl, CM-OS alkoxy, trifluoromethyl, halogen, sulfonyl alkyl, alkylamino, amide, ester, aryl-alkyi, heteroalkyi, and arylalkoxy<br>
The dicarboxylic acids of the present invention are useful intermediates in the synthesis of certain aryl fused azapolycyclic compounds of the formula<br>
wherein R1 and R2 are selected independently from hydrogen, C^-Cg alkyl, CrCs alkoxy, trifluoromethyl, halogen, sulfonyl alkyl, alkylamino, amido, ester, aryl-alkyl, heteroalkyl, and arylalkoxy and wherein R3 is CrCe alkyl. This is disclosed in United States Patent No. 6,410,551 B1, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The indan -1,3-dicarboxylic acids disclosed herein are useful intermediates in the preparation of compounds of formula V, according to the reaction steps outlined in Scheme 2. The proposed process which provides an alternate path to compounds of formula V, is based upon a reaction sequence reported by Mazzocchi, P.H., J. Med. Chem. Vol. 22, no. 4, 455 (1979).<br>
Scheme 2(Figure Remove)<br>
Referring to Scheme 2, the dicarboxylic acid having the formula I is cyclized to the corresponding anhydride by treatment with acetic anhydride at 100°C. The anhydride having formula II is converted to the cyclic imide III in concentrated NH4OH. Next the imide III Is reduced with lithium aluminium hydride to the cyclic amine of formula V.<br>
Examples of specific compounds of the formula V are the following compounds:<br>
4-ethynyl-5-chIoro-10-aza-tricyclo[6.3.0Z|7]dodeca-2(7),3,5-triene;<br>
3-trifluoromethyl-10-aza-tricyclo[6.3.02i7]dodeca-2(7),3,5-triene;<br>
4,5-bistrifluoromethyl-10-aza-tricyclo[6.3.1.02'7]dodeca-2(7),3,5-triene;<br>
4-choro-5-trifluoromethyl-10-aza-tricyclo[6.3.1.02'7]dodeca-2(7),3,5-triene;<br>
4-amino-10-aza-tricycio[6,3.1.02'7]dodeca-2(7),3,5-triene;<br>
4-nitro-10-aza-tricyclo[6.3.02|7]dodeca-2(7),3,5-triene;<br>
4-methyl-10-aza-tricycio[6.3.02'7]dodeca-2(7),3,5-triene;<br>
4-fluoro-10-aza-tricyclo[6.3.02'7]dodeca-2(7),3,5-triene;<br>
4-trifluoromethyl-10-aza-tricyclo[6.3,02'7]dodeca-2(7),3,5-triene;<br>
4,5-difluoro-10-aza-tricyclo[6.3.02'7]dodeca-2(7),3,5-triene;     and     pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.<br>
Compounds of formula V bind to neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine specific receptor sites and are useful in modulating cholinergic function. Such compounds are useful in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (including but not limited to ulcerative colitis, pyoderma gangrenosum and Crohn's disease), irritable bowel syndrome, spastic dystonia, chronic pain, acute pain, celiac sprue, pouchitis, vasoconstriction, anxiety, panic disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, autism, sleep disorders, jet lag, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), cognitive dysfunction, hypertension, bulimia, anorexia, obesity, cardiac arrythmias, gastric acid hypersecretion, ulcers, pheochromocytoma, progressive supranuclear palsy, chemical dependencies and addictions (ag., dependencies on, or addictions to nicotine (and/or tobacco products), alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, opioids or cocaine), headache, migraine, stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), psychosis, Huntington's chorea, tardive dyskinesia, hyperkinesia, dyslexia, schizophrenia, multi-infarct dementia, age-related cognitive decline, epilepsy, including petit mal absence epilepsy, senile dementia of the Alzheimer's type (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Tourette's Syndrome.<br>
The compounds of the formula V and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts (hereafter "the active compounds") can be administered via either the oral, transdermal (e.g.. through the use of a patch), intranasal, sublingual, rectal, parenteral or topical routes. Transdermal and oral administration are preferred. These compounds are, most desirably, administered in dosages ranging from about 0.01 mg up to about 1500 mg per day, preferably from about 0.1 to about 300 mg per day in single or divided doses, although variations will necessarily occur depending upon the weight and condition of the subject being treated and the particular route of administration chosen. However, a dosage level that Is in the range of about 0.001 mg to about 10 mg per kg of body weight per day is most desirably employed. Variations may nevertheless occur depending upon the weight and condition of the persons being treated and their individual responses to said medicament, as well as on the type of pharmaceutical formulation chosen and the time period and interval during which such administration is carried out. In some Instances, dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range may be more than adequate, while in other cases still larger doses may be employed without causing any harmful side effects, provided that such larger doses are first divided into several small doses for administration throughout the day.<br>
The active compounds can be administered alone or in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents by any of the several routes previously indicated.<br>
More particularly, the active compounds can be administered in a wide variety of different dosage forms, e.g., they may be combined with various pharmaceutically acceptable inert carriers in the form of tablets, capsules, transdermal patches, lozenges, troches, hard candies, powders, sprays, creams, salves, suppositories, jellies, gels, pastes, lotions, ointments, aqueous suspensions, injectable solutions, elixirs, syrups, and the like. Such carriers include solid diluents or fillers, sterile aqueous media and various non-toxic organic solvents. In addition, oral pharmaceutical compositions can be suitably sweetened and/or flavored. In general, the active compounds are present in such dosage forms at concentration levels ranging from about 5.0% to about 70% by weight.<br>
For oral administration, tablets may contain a variety of excipients, disintegrants, lubricating agents, and fillers. Aqueous suspensions for oral administration may be combined with flavor, coloring matter, and diluents.<br>
For parental administration, a solution of the active compound may be suitably buffered and may be diluted with a vegetable oil or propylene glycol.<br>
