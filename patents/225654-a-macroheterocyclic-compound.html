or more chiral centers, they may additionally exist as diastereomers. Where the<br><br>
processes for the preparation of the compounds according to the invention give rise to<br>
mixture of stereoisomers, these isomers may be separated by conventional techniques<br>
such as. preparative chromatography. The compounds may be prepared in racemic form<br>
or individual enantiomers may be prepared by standard techniques known to those<br>
skilled in the art, for example, by enantiospecific synthesis or resolution, formation of<br>
diastereomeric pairs by salt formation with an optically active acid, followed by<br>
fractional crystallization and regeneration of the free base. The compounds may also<br>
be resolved by formation of diastereomeric esters or amides, followed by<br>
chromatographic separation and removal of the chiral auxiliary. Alternatively, the<br>
compounds may be resolved using a chiral HPLC column. It is to be understood that<br>
all such isomers and mixtures thereof are encompassed within the scope of the present<br>
invention.<br>

Protein Kinase C Isoforms<br>
Protein kinase C (PKC) is known to play a key role in intracellular signal<br>
transduction (cell-cell signaling), gene expression and in the control of cell<br>
differentiation and growth. The PKC family is composed of twelve isoforms that arc<br>
further classified into 3 subfamilies: the calcium dependent classical PKC isoforms<br>
alpha (a), beta-I (ß-I),beta(ß-II) and gamma (?); the calcium independent PKC<br>
isoforms delta (d), epsilon (e), eta (?), theta (?) and mu (µ); and, the atypical PKC<br><br>
isoforms zeta (?) lambda (?) and iota (?).<br>
Certain disease states tend to be associated with elevation of particular PKC<br>
isoforms. The PKC isoforms exhibit distinct tissue distribution, subcellular localization<br>
and activation-dependent cofactors. For example, the a and ß isoforms of PKC are<br>
selectively induced in vascular cells stimulated with agonists such as vascular<br>
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (P. Xia, et al., J. Clin. Invest., 1996, 98, 2018) and<br>
have been implicated in cellular growth, differentiation, and vascular permeability (H.<br>
Ishii, et al., J. Mol. Med., 1998, 76, 21). The elevated blood glucose levels found in<br>
diabetes leads to an isoform-specific elevation of the P-II isoform in vascular tissues<br>
(Inoguchi, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1992, 89, 11059-11065). A diabetes-<br>
linked elevation of the ß isoform in human platelets has been correlated with the altered<br>
response of the platelets to agonists (Bastyr III, E. J. and Lu, J., Diabetes, 1993, 42,<br>
(Suppl. 1) 97A). The human vitamin D receptor has been shown to be selectively<br>
phosphorylated by PKCp. This phosphorylation has been linked to alterations in the<br>
functioning of the receptor (Hsieh, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1991, 88, 9315-<br>
9319; Hsieh, et al.,J.Biol. Chem., 1993, 268, 15118-15126). In addition, the work has<br>
shown that the P-II isoform is responsible for erythroleukemia cell proliferation while<br>
the a isoform is involved in megakaryocyte differentiation in these same cells<br>
(Murray, et al., J. Biol. Chem., 1993, 268, 15847-15853).<br>
Cardiovascular Diseases<br>
PKC activity plays an important role in cardiovascular diseases. Increased PKC<br>
activity in the vasculature has been shown to cause increased vasoconstriction and<br>
hypertension (Bilder, G. E., et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990, 252, 526-530). PKC<br>
inhibitors block agonist-induced smooth muscle cell proliferation (Matsumoto, H. and<br>
Sasaki, Y.,Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 1989, 158, 105-109). PKC ß triggers<br>
events leading to the induction of Egr-1 (Early Growth Factor-1) and tissue factor<br>
under hypoxic conditions (as part of the oxygen deprivation-mediated pathway for<br>
triggering procoagulant events) (Yan, S-F, et al., J. Biol. Chem., 2000. 275, 16, 11921<br>
11928). PKC ß is suggested as a mediator for production of PAI-1 (Plasminogen<br>
Activator Inhibitor-1) and is implicated in the development of thrombosis and<br><br>
atherosclerosis (Ren, S, et al., Am. J. Physiol., 2000, 278, (4, Pt. 1), E656-E662). PKC<br>
inhibitors are useful in treating cardiovascular ischemia and improving cardiac function<br>
following ischemia (Muid, R. E., et al., FEBS Lett., 1990, 293, 169-172; Sonoki,, H. et<br>
al., Kokyu-To Junkan, 1989, 37, 669-674). Elevated PKC levels have been correlated<br>
with an increase in platelet function in response to agonists (Bastyr III, E. J. and Lu, J.,<br>
Diabetes, 1993, 42, (Suppl. 1) 97A). PKC has been implicated in the biochemical<br>
pathway in the platelet-activating factor (PAF) modulation of microvascular<br>
permeability (Kobayashi, etal., Amer. Phys. Soc, 1994, H1214- HI220). PKC<br>
inhibitors affect agonist-induced aggregation in platelets (Toullec, D., et al., J. Biol.<br>
Chem., 1991, 266, 15771-15781). Accordingly, PKC inhibitors may be indicated for<br>
use in treating cardiovascular disease, ischemia, thrombotic conditions, atherosclerosis<br>
and restenosis.<br>
Diabetes<br>
Excessive activity of PKC has been linked to insulin signaling defects and<br>
therefore to the insulin resistance seen in Type II diabetes (Karasik, A., et al., J. Biol.<br>
Chem., 1990, 265, 10226-10231; Chen, K. S., et al., Trans. Assoc. Am. Physicians,<br>
1991,104, 206-212; Chin, J. E., et al., J. Biol. Chem., 1993, 268, 6338-6347).<br>
Diabetes-Associated Disorders<br>
Studies have demonstrated an increase in PKC activity in tissues known to be<br>
susceptible to diabetic complications when exposed to hyperglycemic conditions (Lee,<br>
T-S., et al., J. Clin. Invest., 1989, 83, 90-94; Lee, T-S., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.<br>
USA, 1989, 86, 5141-5145; Craven, P. A. and DeRubertis, F. R., J. Clin. Invest., 1989,<br>
87, 1667-1675; Wolf, B. A., et al., J. Clin Invest., 1991, 87, 31-38; Tesfamariam, B.,<br>
et al.,.J. Clin. Invest., 1991, 87, 1643-1648). For example, activation of the PKC-ß-II<br>
isoform plays an important role in diabetic vascular complications such as retinopathy<br>
(Ishii, H., et al., Science, 1996, 272, 728 731) and PKCß has been implicated in<br>
development of the cardiac hypertrophy associated with heart failure (X. Gu, et al.,<br>
circ. Res., 1994, 75, 926; R. H. Strasser, et al., circulation, 1996. 94, 1551).<br>
Overexpression of cardiac PKCßII in transgenic mice caused cardiomyopathy<br>
involving hypertrophy, fibrosis and decreased left ventricular function (H. Wakasaki, et<br>
al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1997, 94, 9320).<br><br>
Inflammatory Diseases<br>
PKC inhibitors block inflammatory responses such as the neutrophil oxidative<br>
burst, CD3 down-regulation in T-lymphocytes and phorbol-induced paw edema<br>
(Twoemy, B., et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.. 1990, 171, 1087-1092;<br>
Mulqueen, M. J., et al. Agents Actions, 1992, 37, 85-89). PKC P has an essential role in<br>
the degranulation of bone marrow-derived mast cells, thus affecting cell capacity to<br>
produce IL-6 (Interleukin-6) (Nechushtan, H., et al., Blood, 2000 (March), 95, 5, 1752-<br>
1757). PKC plays a role in enhanced ASM (Airway Smooth Muscle) cell growth in rat<br>
models of two potential risks for asthma: hyperresponsiveness to contractile agonists<br>
and to growth stimuli (Ren, S, et al., Am. J. Physiol., 2000, 278, (4, Pt. 1), E656-E662).<br>
PKC ß-1 overexpression augments an increase in endothelial permeability, suggesting<br>
an important function in the regulation of the endothelial barrier (Nagpala, P.G., et al.,<br>
J. Cell Physiol., 1996, 2, 249-55). PKC ß mediates activation of neutrophil NADPH<br>
oxidase by PMA and by stimulation of Fc? receptors in neutrophils (Dekker, L.V., et<br>
al., Biochem. J., 2000, 347, 285-289). Thus, PKC inhibitors may be indicated for use in<br>
treating inflammation and asthma.<br>
Immunological Disorders<br>
PKC may be useful in treating or ameliorating certain immunological disorders.<br>
While one study suggests that HC1-4V (Human Cytomegalovirus) inhibition is not<br>
correlated with PKC inhibition (Slater, M.J., et al., Biorg. &amp; Med. Chem., 1999, 7,<br>
1067-1074), another study showed that the PKC signal transduction pathway<br>
synergistically interacted with the cAMP-dependent PKA pathway to activate or<br>
increase HIV-1 transcription and viral replication and was abrogated with a PKC<br>
inhibitor (Rabbi, M.F., et al., Virology, 1998 (June 5), 245, 2, 257-69). Therefore, an<br>
immunological disorder may be treated or ameliorated as a function of the affected<br>
underlying pathway's response to up- or down-regulation of PKC.<br>
PKC ß deficiency also results in an immunodeficiency characterized by<br>
impaired humoral immune responses and a reduced B cell response, similar to X-linked<br>
immunodeficiency in mice and plays an important role in antigen receptor-mediated<br>
signal transduction (Leitges, M., et al., Science (Wash., D.C.), 1996, 273, 5276, 788-<br><br>
789). Accordingly, transplant tissue rejection may be ameliorated or prevented by<br>
suppressing the immune response using a PKC (J inhibitor.<br>
Dermatological Disorders<br>
Abnormal activity of PKC has been linked to dermatological disorders<br>
characterized by abnormal proliferation of keratinocytes, such as psoriasis (Horn, F., et<br>
al., J. Invest. Dermatol., 1987, 88, 220-222; Raynaud, F. and Evain-Brion, D., Br. J.<br>
Dermatol., 1991, 124, 542-546). PKC inhibitors have been shown to inhibit<br>
keratinocyte proliferation in a dose-dependent manner (Hegemann, L., et al., Arch.<br>
Dermatol. Res., 1991, 283, 456-460; Bollag, W. B., et al.,J. Invest. Dermatol, 1993,<br>
100, 240-246).<br>
Oncological Disorders<br>
PKC activity has been associated with cell growth, tumor promotion,<br>
uncontrolled cell growth and cancer (Rotenberg, S. A. and Weinstein, I. B., Biochem.<br>
Mol. Aspects Sel. Cancer, 1991, J, 25-73; Ahmad, et al., Molecular Pharmacology,<br>
1993, 43, 858-862); PKC inhibitors are known to be effective in preventing tumor<br>
growth in animals (Meyer, T., et al., Int. J. Cancer, 1989, 43, 851-856; Akinagaka, S.,<br>
et al., Cancer Res., 1991, 51, 4888-4892). PKC ß-1 and ß-2 expression in<br>
differentiated HD3 colon carcinoma cells blocked their differentiation, enabling them<br>
to proliferate in response to basic FGF (Fibroblast Growth Factor) like undifferentiated<br>
cells, increasing their growth rate and activating several MBP (Myelin-Basic Protein)<br>
kinases, including p57 MAP (Mitogen-Activated Protein) kinase (Sauma, S., et al., Cell<br>
Growth Differ., 1996, 7, 5, 587-94). PKC a inhibitors, having an additive therapeutic<br>
effect in combination with other anti-cancer agents, inhibited the growth of<br>
lymphocytic leukemia cells (Konig, A., et al., Blood, 1997, 90, 10, Suppl. 1 Pt. 2).<br>
PKC inhibitors enhanced MMC (Mitomycin-C) induced apoptosis in a time-dependent<br>
fashion in a gastric cancer cell-line, potentially indicating use as agents for<br>
chemotherapy-induced apoptosis (Danso, D., et al., Proc Am. Assoc. Cancer Res.,<br>
1997, 38, 88 Meet., 92). Therefore, PKC inhibitors may be indicated for use in<br>
ameliorating cell and tumor growth, in treating or ameliorating cancers (such as<br>
leukemia or colon cancer) and as adjuncts to chemotherapy.<br><br>
PKC a (by enhancing cell migration) may mediate some proangiogenic effects<br>
of PKC activation while PKC 5 may direct antiangiogenic effects of overall PKC<br>
activation (by inhibiting cell growth and proliferation) in capillary endothelial cells,<br>
thus regulating endothelial proliferation and angiogenesis (Harrington, E.O., et al., J.<br>
Biol. Chem., 1997, 272, 11, 7390-7397). PKC inhibitors inhibit cell growth and induce<br>
apoptosis in human glioblastoma cell lines, inhibit the growth of human astrocytoma<br>
xenografts and act as radiation sensitizers in glioblastoma cell lines (Begemann, M, et<br>
al., Anticancer Res. (Greece), 1998 (Jul-Aug), 18, 4A, 2275-82). PKC inhibitors, in<br>
combination with other anti-cancer agents, are radiation and chemosensitizers useful in<br>
cancer therapy (Teicher, B.A., et al., Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res., 1998, 39, 89 Meet.,<br>
384). PKC ß inhibitors (by blocking the MAP kinase signal transduction pathways for<br>
VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) and bFGF (basic Fibrinogen Growth<br>
Factor) in endothelial cells), in a combination regimen with other anti-cancer agents,<br>
have an anti-angiogenic and antitumor effect in a human T98G glioblastoma<br>
multiforme xenograft model (Teicher, B.A., et al., Clinical Cancer Research, 2001<br>
(March), 7, 634-640). Accordingly, PKC inhibitors may be indicated for use in<br>
ameliorating angiogenesis and in treating or ameliorating cancers (such as breast, brain,<br>
kidney, bladder, ovarian or colon cancers) and as adjuncts to chemotherapy and<br>
radiation therapy.<br>
Central Nervous System Disorders<br>
PKC activity plays a central role in the functioning of the CNS (Huang, K. P.,<br>
Trends Neurosci., 1989,12, 425-432) and PKC is implicated in Alzheimer's disease<br>
(Shimohama, S., et al., Neurology, 1993, 43, 1407-1413) and inhibitors have been<br>
shown to prevent the damage seen in focal and central ischemic brain injury and brain<br>
edema (Hara, H., et al., J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab., 1990, 10, 646-653; Shibata, S., et<br>
al.. Brain Res., 1992, 594, 290-294). Accordingly, PKC inhibitors may be indicated for<br>
use in treating Alzheimers disease and in treating neurotraumatic and ischemia-related<br>
diseases.<br>
The long-term increase in PKC y (as a component of the phosphoinositidc 2nd<br>
messenger system) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor expression in an amygdala-<br><br>
kindled rat model has been associated with epilepsy, serving as a basis for the rat's<br>
permanent state of hyperexcitability (Beldhuis, H.J.A., et al., Neuroscience, 1993, 55,<br>
4, 965-73). Therefore, PKC inhibitors may be indicated for use in treating epilepsy.<br>
The subcellular changes in content of the PKC y and PKC P-II isoenzymes for<br>
animals in an in-vivo thermal hyperalgesia model suggests that peripheral nerve injury<br>
contributes to the development of persistent pain (Miletic, V., et al., Neurosci. Lett.,<br>
2000, 288, 3, 199-202). Mice lacking PKC? display normal responses to acute pain<br>
stimuli, but almost completely fail to develop a neuropathic pain syndrome after partial<br>
sciatic nerve section (Chen, C, et al., Science (Wash., D.C.), 1997, 278, 5336, 279-<br>
283). PKC modulation may thus be indicated for use in treating chronic pain and<br>
neuropathic pain.<br>
PKC has demonstrated a role in the pathology of conditions such as, but not<br>
limited to, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, diabetes-associated disorders,<br>
inflammatory diseases, immunological disorders, dermatological disorders, oncological<br>
disorders and central nervous system disorders.<br>
Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3<br>
Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is a serineJthreonine protein kinase<br>
composed of two isoforms (a and P) which are encoded by distinct genes. GSK-3 is<br>
one of several protein kinases which phosphorylate glycogen synthase (GS) (Embi, et<br>
al., Eur. J. Biochem, 1980, 107, 519-527). The a and ß isoforms have a monomeric<br>
structure of 49 and 47kD respectively and are both found in mammalian cells. Both<br>
isoforms phosphorylate muscle glycogen synthase (Cross, et al., BiochemicalJournal,<br>
1994, 303, 21-26) and these two isoforms show good homology between species<br>
(human and rabbit GSK-3a arc 96% identical).<br>
Diabetes<br>
Type II diabetes (or Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus, NIDDM) is a<br>
multifactorial disease. Hyperglycemia is due to insulin resistance in the liver, muscle<br>
and other tissues coupled with inadequate or defective secretion of insulin from<br>
pancreatic islets. Skeletal muscle is the major site for insulin-stimulated glucose<br><br>
uptake. In this tissue, glucose removed from the circulation is either metabolised<br>
through glycolysis and the TCA (tricarboxylic acid) cycle or stored as glycogen.<br>
Muscle glycogen deposition plays the more important role in glucose homeostasis and<br>
Type II diabetic subjects have defective muscle glycogen storage. The stimulation of<br>
glycogen synthesis by insulin in skeletal muscle results from the dephosphorylation and<br>
activation of glycogen synthase (Villar-palasi C. and Larner J., Biochim. Biophys. Acta,<br>
1960, 39, 171-173, parker p.J., et al., Eur. J. Biochem., 1983,130, 227-234, and Cohen<br>
p., Biochem. Soc. Trans., 1993, 21, 555-567). The phosphorylation and<br>
dephosphorylation of GS are mediated by specific kinases and phosphatases. GSK-3 is<br>
responsible for phosphorylation and deactivation of GS, while glycogen bound protein<br>
phosphatase 1 (pp1G) dephosphorylates and activates GS. Insulin both inactivates<br>
GSK-3 and activates pp1G (Srivastava A.K. and pandey S.K., Mol. and Cellular<br>
Biochem., 1998,182, 135-141).<br>
Studies suggest that an increase in GSK-3 activity might be important in Type II<br>
diabetic muscle (Chen, et al., Diabetes, 1994, 43, 1234-1241). Overexpression of<br>
GSK-3ß and constitutively active GSK-3ß (S9A, S9e) mutants in HEK-293 cells<br>
resulted in suppression of glycogen synthase activity (Eldar-Finkelman, et al., pNAS,<br>
1996, 93, 10228-10233) and overexpression of GSK-3ß in CHO cells, expressing both<br>
insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) resulted in impairment of<br>
insulin action (Eldar-Finkelman and Krebs, pNAS, 1997, 94, 9660-9664). Recent<br>
evidence for the involvement of elevated GSK-3 activity and the development of<br>
insulin resistance and Type II diabetes in adipose tissue has emerged from studies<br>
undertaken in diabetes and obesity prone C57BLJ6J mice (Eldar-Finkelman, et al,<br>
Diabetes, 1999, 48, 1662-1666).<br>
Inflammatory Diseases<br>
Studies on fibroblasts from the GSK-3ß knockout mouse indicate that inhibition<br>
of GSK-3 may be useful in treating inflammatory disorders or diseases through the<br>
negative regulation of NFkB activity (Hoeflich K. p., et al., Nature, 2000, 406, 86-90).<br>
Dermatoloffical Disorders<br>
The finding that transient p-catenin stabilization may play a role in hair<br><br>
development (Gat, et al., Cell, 1998, 95, 605-614) suggests that GSK-3 inhibitors could<br>
also be used in the treatment of baldness.<br>
Central Nervous System Disorders<br>
In addition to modulation of glycogen synthase activity, GSK-3 also plays an<br>
important role in the CNS disorders. GSK-3 inhibitors may be of value as<br>
neuroprotectants in the treatment of acute stroke and other neurotraumatic injuries (pap<br>
and Cooper, J. Biol. Chem., 1998, 273, 19929-19932). Lithium, a low mM inhibitor of<br>
GSK-3, has been shown to protect cerebellar granule neurons from death (D'Mello, et<br>
al., Exp. Cell Res., 1994, 211, 332-338) and chronic lithium treatment has demonstrable<br>
efficacy in the middle cerebral artery occlusion model of stroke in rodents (Nonaka and<br>
Chuang, Neuroreport, 1998, 9(9), 2081-2084).<br>
Tau and p-catenin, two known in vivo substrates of GSK-3, are of direct<br>
relevance in consideration of further aspects of the value of GSK-3 inhibitors in<br>
relation to treatment of chronic neurodegenerative conditions. Tau<br>
hyperphosphorylation is an early event in neurodegenerative conditions such as<br>
Alzheimer's disease and is postulated to promote microtubule disassembly. Lithium<br>
has been reported to reduce the phosphorylation of tau, enhance the binding of tau to<br>
microtubules and promote microtubule assembly through direct and reversible<br>
inhibition of GSK-3 (Hong M. et al J. Biol. Chem., 1997, 272(40), 25326-32). p-<br>
catenin is phosphorylated by GSK-3 as part of a tripartite axin protein complex<br>
resulting in p-catenin degradation (Ikeda, et al., EMBO J., 1998,17, 1371-1384).<br>
Inhibition of GSK-3 activity is involved in the stabilization of catenin and promotes p-<br>
catenin-LEF-1JTCF transcriptional activity (Eastman, Grosschedl, Curr. Opin. Cell<br>
Biol., 1999, J J, 233). Studies have also suggested that GSK-3 inhibitors may also be of<br>
value in the treatment of schizophrenia (Cotter D., et al. Neuroreport, 1998, 9, 1379-<br>
1383; Lijam N., et al., Cell, 1997, 90, 895-905) and manic depression (Manji, et al., J.<br>
Clin. psychiatry, 1999, 60, (Suppl 2) 27-39 for review).<br>
Accordingly, compounds found useful as GSK-3 inhibitors could have further<br>
therapeutic utility in the treatment of diabetes, inflammatory diseases, dermatological<br>
disorders and central nervous system disorders.<br><br>
A preferred method of the present invention is a method for treating or<br>
ameliorating a kinase or dual-kinase mediated disorder in a subject in need thereof<br>
comprising administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of an instant<br>
compound or pharmaceutical composition thereof. The therapeutically effective<br>
amount of the compounds of Formula (I) exemplified in such a method is from about<br>
0.001 mgJkgJday to about 300 mgJkgJday.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention include the use of a compound of<br>
Formula (I) for the preparation of a medicament for treating or ameliorating a kinase or<br>
dual-kinase mediated disorder in a subject in need thereof wherein a preferred method<br>
step comprises administering the kinase to dual-kinase inhibitor to a patient.<br>
In accordance with the methods of the present invention, an individual<br>
compound of the present invention or a pharmaceutical composition thereof can be<br>
administered separately at different times during the course of therapy or concurrently<br>
in divided or single combination forms. The instant invention is therefore to be<br>
understood as embracing all such regimes of simultaneous or alternating treatment and<br>
the term "administering" is to be interpreted accordingly.<br>
Embodiments of the present method include a compound or pharmaceutical<br>
composition thereof advantageously co-administered in combination with other agents<br>
for treating, reducing or ameliorating the effects of a kinase or dual-kinase mediated<br>
disorder. For example, in the treatment of diabetes, especially Type II diabetes, a<br>
compound of Formula (I) or pharmaceutical composition thereof may be used in<br>
combination with other agents, especially insulin or antidiabetic agents including, but<br>
not limited to, insulin secretagogues (such as sulphonylureas), insulin sensitizers<br>
including, but not limited to, glitazone insulin sensitizers (such as thiazolidinediones)<br>
or biguanides or a glucosidase inhibitors.<br>
The combination product is a product that comprises the co-administration of a<br>
compound of Formula (I) or a pharmaceutical composition thereof and an additional<br>
agent for treating or ameliorating a kinase or dual-kinase mediated disorder, and the<br><br>
term combination product further comprises a product that is sequentially administered<br>
where the product comprises a compound of Formula (I) or pharmaceutical<br>
composition thereof and an additional agent for treating or ameliorating a kinase or<br>
dual-kinase mediated disorder, administration of a pharmaceutical composition<br>
containing a compound of Formula (I) or pharmaceutical composition thereof and an<br>
additional agent for treating or ameliorating a kinase or dual-kinase mediated disorder<br>
or the essentially simultaneous administration of a separate pharmaceutical composition<br>
containing a compound of Formula (I) or pharmaceutical composition thereof and a<br>
separate pharmaceutical composition containing an additional agent for treating or<br>
ameliorating a kinase or dual-kinase mediated disorder.<br>
The term "subject" as used herein, refers to an animal, preferably a mammal,<br>
most preferably a human, who has been the object of treatment, observation or<br>
experiment.<br>
The term "therapeutically effective amount" as used herein, means that amount<br>
of active compound or pharmaceutical agent that elicits the biological or medicinal<br>
response in a tissue system, animal or human, that is being sought by a researcher,<br>
veterinarian, medical doctor, or other clinician, which includes alleviation of the<br>
symptoms of the disease or disorder being treated.<br>
The ubiquitous nature of the PKC and GSK isoforms and their important roles<br>
in physiology provide incentive to produce highly selective PKC and GSK inhibitors.<br>
Given the evidence demonstrating linkage of certain isoforms to disease states, it is<br>
reasonable to assume that inhibitory compounds that are selective to one or two PKC<br>
isoforms or to a GSK isoform relative to the other PKC and GSK isoforms and other<br>
protein kinases are superior therapeutic agents. Such compounds should demonstrate<br>
greater efficacy and lower toxicity by virtue of their specificity. Accordingly, it will be<br>
appreciated by one skilled in the art that a particular compound of Formula (I) is<br>
selected where it is therapeutically effective for a particular kinase or dual-kinase<br>
mediated disorder based on the modulation of the disorder through the demonstration<br>
of selective kinase or dual-kinase inhibition in response to that compound.<br>
Experiments exemplifying selective kinase or dual-kinase inhibition are provided in the<br><br>
examples. The usefulness of a compound of Formula (I) as a selective kinase or dual-<br>
kinase inhibitor can be determined according to the methods disclosed herein and based<br>
on the data obtained to date, it is anticipated that a particular compound will be useful<br>
in inhibiting one or more kinase or dual-kinase mediated disorders and therefore is<br>
uesfull in one or more kinase or dual-kinase mediated disorders.<br>
Therefore, the term "kinase or dual-kinase mediated disorders" as used herein,<br>
includes, and is not limited to, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, diabetes-associated<br>
disorders, inflammatory diseases, immunological disorders, dermatological disorders,<br>
oncological disorders and CNS disorders.<br>
Cardiovascular diseases include, and are not limited to, acute stroke, heart<br>
failure, cardiovascular ischemia, thrombosis, atherosclerosis, hypertension, restenosis,<br>
retinopathy of prematurity or age-related macular degeneration. Diabetes includes<br>
insulin dependent diabetes or Type II non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.<br>
Diabetes-associated disorders include, and are not limited to, impaired glucose<br>
tolerance, diabetic retinopathy, proliferative retinopathy, retinal vein occlusion, macular<br>
edema, cardiomyopathy, nephropathy or neuropathy. Inflammatory diseases include,<br>
and are not limited to, vascular permeability, inflammation, asthma, rheumatoid<br>
arthritis or osteoarthritis. Immunological disorders include, and are not limited to,<br>

PKC modulation. Dermatological disorders include, and are not limited to, psoriasis,<br>
hair loss or baldness. Oncological disorders include, and are not limited to, cancer or<br>
tumor growth (such as breast, brain, kidney, bladder, ovarian or colon cancer or<br>
leukemia) and other diseases associated with uncontrolled cell proliferation such as<br>
recurring benign tumors as well as including proliferative angiopathy and angiogenesis;<br>
and, includes use for compounds of Formula (I) as an adjunct to chemotherapy and<br>
radiation therapy. CNS disorders include, and are not limited to, chronic pain,<br>
neuropathic pain, epilepsy, chronic neurodegenerative conditions (such as dementia or<br>
Alzheimer's disease), mood disorders (such as schizophrenia), manic depression or<br>
neurotraumatic, cognitive decline and ischemia-related diseases (as a result of head<br>
trauma (from acute ischemic stroke, injury or surgery) or transient ischemic stroke<br>
(from coronary bypass surgery or other transient ischemic conditions))<br><br>
pharmaceutical compositions contemplated within this invention can be<br>
prepared according to conventional pharmaceutical techniques. A pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier may be used in the composition of the invention. The composition<br>
may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for<br>
administration including, but not limited to, intravenous (both bolus and infusion), oral,<br>
nasal, transdermal, topical with or without occlusion, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous,<br>
intramuscular or parenteral, all using forms well known to those of ordinary skill in the<br>
pharmaceutical arts. In preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, one or more of<br>
the usual pharmaceutical carriers may be employed, such as water, glycols, oils,<br>
alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents, syrup and the like in the case<br>
of oral liquid preparations (for example, suspensions, elixirs and solutions), or carriers<br>
such as starches, sugars, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating<br>
agents and the like in the case of oral solid preparations (for example, powders,<br>
capsules and tablets).<br>
As is also known in the art, the compounds may alternatively be administered<br>
parenterally via injection of a formulation consisting of the active ingredient dissolved<br>
in an inert liquid carrier. The injectable formulation can include the active ingredient<br>
mixed with an appropriate inert liquid carrier. Acceptable liquid carriers include<br>
vegetable oils such as peanut oil, cotton seed oil, sesame oil, and the like, as well as<br>
organic solvents such as solketal, glycerol, formal, and the Like. As an alternative,<br>
aqueous parenteral formulations may also be used. For example, acceptable aqueous<br>
solvents include water, Ringer's solution and an isotonic aqueous saline solution.<br>
Further, a sterile non-volatile oil can usually be employed as solvent or suspending<br>
agent in the aqueous formulation. The formulations are prepared by dissolving or<br>
suspending the active ingredient in the liquid carrier such that the final formulation<br>
contains from 0.005 to 10% by weight of the active ingredient. Other additives<br>
including a preservative, an isotonizer, a solubilizer, a stabilizer and a pain-soothing<br>
agent may adequately be employed.<br>
Furthermore, compounds of the present invention can be administered in<br>
intranasal form via topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles, or via transdermal routes,<br><br>
using those forms of transdermal skin patches well known to those of ordinary skill in<br>
that art. To be administered in the form of a transdermal delivery system, the dosage<br>
administration will, of course, be continuous rather than intermittent throughout the<br>
dosage regimen.<br>
Because of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent an<br>
advantageous oral dosage unit form, wherein solid pharmaceutical carriers are<br>
employed. If desired, tablets may be sugar-coated or enteric-coated by standard<br>
techniques.<br>
For liquid forms the active drug component can be combined in suitably<br>
flavored suspending or dispersing agents such as the synthetic and natural gums,<br>
including for example, tragacanth, acacia, methyl-cellulose and the like. Other<br>
dispersing agents that may be employed include glycerin and the like.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can also be administered in the form of<br>
liposome delivery systems, such as small unilamellar vesicles, large unilamellar<br>
vesicles and multilamellar vesicles. Liposomes containing delivery systems as well<br>
known in the art are formed from a variety of phospholipids, such as cholesterol,<br>
stearylamine or phosphatidylcholines.<br>
The instant pharmaceutical composition will generally contain a per dosage unit<br>
(e.g., tablet, capsule, powder, injection, teaspoonful and the like) from about 0.001 to<br>
about 100 mgJkg. In one embodiment, the instant pharmaceutical composition contains<br>
a per dosage unit of from about 0.01 to about 50 mgJkg of compound, and preferably<br>
from about 0.05 to about 20 mgJkg. Methods are known in the art for determining<br>
therapeutically effective doses for the instant pharmaceutical composition. The<br>
therapeutically effective amount for administering the pharmaceutical composition to a<br>
human, for example, can be determined mathematically from the results of animal<br>
studies.<br>

Biotinylated Peptide Substrate Assay<br>
Assays to test inhibition of a compound for other kinases were preformed using<br>
methods that measure the amount of phosphorylation of a biotinylated peptide<br>
substrate. Biotinylated peptide substrates were selected from the literature as<br>

Flashplate and 1 	µL drug stock in 100% DMSO was added to a 100 µL reaction<br>
volume resulting in a final concentration of 1% DMSO in the reaction. Enzyme was<br>
diluted in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH=8.0, 0.1% BSA and added to each well. The reaction<br>
was incubated for one hour at 30°C in the presence of compound. After one hour the<br>
reaction mix was aspirated from the plate and the plate was washed with PBS<br>
containing 100 mM EDTA. The plate was read on a scintillation counter to determine<br>
33P-?-ATP incorporated into the immobilized peptide. Test compounds were assayed in<br>
duplicate at 8 concentrations (100 uM, K)uM, I uM, 100nM, 10nM, 1 nM, 100pM,<br>
10 pM). A maximum and minimum signal for the assay was determined on each plate.<br>
The IC50 was calculated from the dose response curve of the percent inhibition of the<br><br>
maximum signal in the assay according to the formula:<br>
% Inhibition = ((MS - BS)/(TCS - BS)) X 100%<br>
where MS = Maximum Signal, BS = Background Signal, TCS = Test Compound<br>
Signal. The percent inhibition was graphed against the log concentration of the test<br>
compound. Known inhibitor compounds as appropriate references for the kinase being<br>
assayed were also included on each plate.<br>

Kinase-1 is a protein truncation at amino acid 318 of the C-terminal portion of the rat<br>
CK1 delta isoform produced in E.coli (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA, Cat.<br>
#6030). Insulin Receptor Kinase consists of residues 941-1313 of the cytoplasmic<br>
domain of the beta-subunit of the human insulin receptor (BIOMOL, Plymouth<br>
Meeting, PA, Cat. #SE-195). Calmodulin Kinase (calmodulin-dependent protein<br>
kinase 2) is a truncated version of the alpha subunit of the rat protein produced in insect<br>
cells (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA, Cat. #6060). MAP Kinase is the rat ERK-2<br>
isoform containing a polyhistidine tag at the N-terminus produced in E.coli and<br>
activated by phosphorylation with MEK1 prior to purification (BIOMOL, Plymouth<br>
Meeting, PA, Cat. #SE-137). EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) is purified<br>
from human A431 cell membranes (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, Cat.# E3641).<br>

IC50 data for certain compounds of the invention tested against various kinases are<br>
shown in Table 2. For compounds where a kinase IC50 value is &gt;10, there was no<br>
observed 50% inhibition at the highest dose tested for that kinase nor was an inhibition<br>
maxima observed.<br><br>
Cell-Based GSK 3-/3 Assay<br>
Glycogen content of L6 muscle cells was measured according to the method described<br>
in Bergerand Hayes, Anal. Biochem., 1998, 261, 159-163.<br>
Procedure<br>
Briefly, L6 cells were serum starved overnight in alpha-MEM containing 0.1%.<br>
On the following day, cells were washed three times with 300 µL KRPH buffer (150<br>
mM NaCl. 5 mM KCl, 2.9 mM Na2HPO4, 1.25 mM MgSO4, 1.2 mM CaCl2, 10 mM<br>
HEPES, pH 7.4) and labeled with 200 µL alpha-MEM containing 5.5 mM 14C-Glucose<br>
(0.1 µCi) ;n the presence of vehicle (DMSO) or compounds. After 2 hours, cells were<br>
washed three times with ice-cold PBS and glycogen was precipitated for 2 hours using<br><br>
ice-cold 66% EtOH. Precipitated glycogen was then washed three times with ice-cold<br>
66% EtOH and 14C-glycogen was quantified using a TopCount (Packard).<br>
As shown in Table 3, L6 skeletal muscle cells demonstrated increased glycogen<br>
synthesis upon exposure to Compounds 1, 2 and 5. Compounds were tested in separate<br>
experiments at the dose levels shown. Where shown, the 0.0 µM dose was used as a<br>
control.<br><br><br>
