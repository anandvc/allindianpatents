				<td>1 Process for the production of benzopvran-2-ol derivatives<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the production of intermediates useful in the preparation of tolterodine, fesoterodine and other pharmaceutically useful compounds. The invention also provides improved processes for the production of such pharmaceutically useful compounds using the intermediates.<br>
Tolterodine {2-[(lR)-3-[bis(1 -methylethyl)amino]-1 -phenylpropyl]-4-methylphenol or alternatively (+)-N,N-diisopropyl-3-(2-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl)-3-phenylpropylamine},<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
is a muscarinic receptor antagonist for the treatment of overactive bladder including urinary incontinence. It gained its first marketing approval (as the tartrate salt) in 1997 and was launched in many markets in the following years under the trade marks DETROL and DETRUSITOL. Tolterodine tartrate was disclosed in International Patent Application WO 89/06644 (see in particular Example 22 and claim 7).<br>
WO 98/29402 discloses a process for the production of tolterodine which comprises condensing p-cresol (a) with cirmamic acid (b), followed by reduction of the resulting lactone (c) with a reducing agent, such as diisobutylaluminium hydride (DIBAL), sodium bis(2-methoxyethoxy)aluminium hydride or lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminohydride, to give the corresponding benzopyran-2-ol compound (d). The benzopyran-2-ol compound (d) can then be converted to racemic tolterodine hydrochloride (e) by reductive amination with diisopropylamine, followed by addition of aqueous hydrochloric acid. Finally, tolterodine L-tartrate is formed by neutralisation of the hydrochloride salt (e) with NaOH/NaHCO3 and subsequent resolution using L-tartaric acid. The process is shown in Scheme 1 below.<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
It can be seen that in the process disclosed by WO 98/29402, the benzopyran-2-ol compound (d) is prepared in two steps and involves the use of a relatively expensive reducing agent (DIBAL).<br>
WO 01/49649 describes the reductive amination of the enantiomers of compound (d) above to give tolterodine and its enantiomer. The enantiomers of compound (d) are produced by enantioselective reactions. It also relates to the same processes applied to analogous compounds, in particular the analogue of tolterodine in which the methyl group in the phenolic ring is replaced with a 5-hydroxymethyl group.<br>
US Patent Application 2003/0236438 (MacMillan et at) discloses the use of comparatively complex chiral imidazolidinone catalysts [e.g. (2S,5S)-5-benzyl-2-tert-butyl-3-methylimidazolidin-4-one] for carrying out enantioselective 1,4-addition reactions between aniline nucleophiles and a,p-unsaturated aldehydes (this work is also described in MacMillan et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc, 2002, 124, 7894-7895). Example 2 from US Patent Application 2003/0236438 is typical of the reactions disclosed:<br><br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
It can be seen that the carbon atom of the aromatic ring para to the amine group bonds to the alpha-beta unsaturated aldehyde.<br>
 Jurd (Journal of Heterocylic Chemistry, vol 28 (4), 1991, pp 983-986) describes the reaction of 3,4-methylenedioxyphenol, morpholine and cinnamaldehyde in methanol to produce 2-morpholinyl-4-phenylbenzopyrans.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that the benzopyran-2-ol compound (d) of Scheme 1 I    can be produced in a one-pot reaction starting from p-cresol (a). Analogous compounds can also be produced.  Thus, according to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a process for the production of a compound of formula (I),<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
wherein Y is selected from CH3, CH2OH, CH2CH2OH, CH2Br and Br;<br>
comprising the steps of:<br>
(i)       reacting a compound of formula (II),<br>
wherein <br>
OX is hydroxy or 0"M+, in which M+ is a cation selected from Li+, Na+ and K+, and<br>
Y is as defined above;<br>
with /trans-cinnamaldehyde (III),<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
in the presence of a secondary amine compound; then<br>
(ii)      treating the product of the preceding step with acid to afford the compound of<br>
formula (I).<br>
By "secondary amine compound" we mean an organic compound which contains at least one secondary amine group, i.e. a compound of the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
in which R1 and R2 are not hydrogen. Preferably, Ra and Rb are each linked to the nitrogen atom by a CH2 group, for example they are independently C1-6 alkyl or together form a 4- or 5-membered alkyl chain in which one carbon atom is optionally replaced by OorN.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the first aspect of the invention are those in which:<br>
(a)	OX is hydroxy;<br>
(b)	Y is CHaorCH2OH;<br>
(c)	the secondary amine compound is achiral;<br>
(d)	the secondary amine compound contains two secondary amine groups, for example piperazine (this catalyst produces particularly high yields);<br>
(e)	when the secondary amine compound contains two secondary amine groups, 0.5-1.25 mole equivalents of the secondary amine compound are used in step (i);<br>
(f)	alternatively, the secondary amine compound contains one secondary amine group, and more preferably the secondary amine compound is morpholine, dibutylamine, dibenzylamine, 1,1,3,3-tetramethylguanidine, diethylamine, diisopropylamine, piperidine or an N-(C1-6 alkyl)piperazine. N-methylpiperazine is particularly preferred because it produces good yields, the initial product [see formula (VI) below] is readily hydrolysed to the corresponding lactol compound of formula (I), and the crude compound of formula (I) has an improved purity which facilitates crystallization;<br>
(g)      when the secondary amine compound contains one secondary amine group, 1-5,<br>
more preferably 1-2.5 mole equivalents of the secondary amine compound are used in<br>
step(i);<br>
(h)      the acid used in step (ii) is aqueous hydrochloric acid (preferably no more than<br>
2M concentration), although the following aqueous acids at similar concentrations also<br>
provide good results: citric acid, acetic acid, oxalic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, maleic acid,<br>
fumaric acid, salicyclic acid, /trans-cinnamic acid, benzoic acid, camphor sulfonic acid<br>
and tosic acid;<br>
(i)       the reaction of step (i) is carried out in an organic solvent selected from toluene,<br>
xylene, N-butyl acetate, t-amyl alcohol, dioxane and dibutyl ether, most preferably<br>
toluene (which produces particularly high yields);<br>
(j)       the reaction of step (i) is carried out at a temperalure in the range 80°C to the<br>
reflux temperature of the solvent;<br>
(k)      the reaction of step (i) is carried out under conditions that remove water from the<br>
reaction system (e.g. Dean-Stark conditions, in which' water produced by the reaction is<br>
condensed in a side condenser so that it does not return to the reaction mixture, and can<br>
be drained off if desired); and<br>
(1)       the reaction of step (i) is carried out at or around ambient pressure (e.g. a nitrogen<br>
atmosphere of slightly elevated pressure may be used, particularly on an industrial scale).<br>
It is particularly preferred that when Y is CH2OH, the secondary amine compound is N-methyipiperazine.<br>
Preferably, the secondary amine compound contains two basic nitrogen atoms. Such compounds produce initial products [see formula (VI) below] which hydrolyse readily to compounds of formula (I).<br>
According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a process for the production of a compound of formula (IV),<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
wherein Y is selected from CH3, CH2OH, CH2CH2OH, CH2Br and Br, or a salt thereof, comprising:<br>
(a)	producing a compound of formula (I) as defined above, using the process according to the first aspect of the invention; then<br>
(b)	reductively aminating the compound of formula (I) with diisopropylamine;<br>
(c)	and where desired converting the resulting compound into a salt.<br>
Preferably, in the second aspect of the invention, Y is CH3 or CH2OH. When Y is CH3, the compound of formula (IV) may be treated with L-tartaric acid in step (c), to produce tolterodine L-tartrate [i.e. R-(+)-toIterodine L-tartrate]. When the compound of formula (IV) is to be used as a pharmaceutical, the salt form produced in this second aspect of the invention is preferably pharmaceutically acceptable. However, when the compound will be processed further, this is not essential.<br>
The reductive amination of a compound of formula (I) may comprise treatment with diisopropylamine in a suitable solvent, such as methanol (which is preferred) or tert-amy1 alcohol or mixtures thereof, followed by hydrogenation in the presence of a catalyst, such as Pd/C or Pd(0H)2/C.<br>
In one embodiment, the compound of formula (IV) may be treated with an aqueous acid, such as hydrochloric acid, to afford the corresponding hydrochloride salt. The racemic compound may be converted to the corresponding (R)-enantiomer L-tartrate salt by neutralization of the hydrochloride salt in the presence of base, such as a mixture of sodium hydroxide and sodium carbonate, followed by resolution with L-tartaric acid. In one embodiment, tolterodine L-tartrate [i.e. R-(+)-tolterodine L-tartrate] is prepared.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the (R)-enantiomer L-tart.-ate salt of the compound of formula (FV) may be prepared directly following reductive amination of the compound of formula (I) without formation of the hydrochloride salt. For example, in one embodiment the product of the reductive amination step may be treated with a solvent such as acetone and L-tartaric acid to afford the L-tartrate salt. When Y is CH3, this produces tolterodine L-tartrate [i.e. R-(+)-toIterodine L-tartrate].<br>
According to a third aspect, the invention provides a process for the production of fesoterodine,<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, which comprises:<br>
(a)	producing a compound of formula (IV), as defined above in which Y is CH2OH, using the process described above;<br>
(b)	resolving the product of step (a) to obtain the (R)-enantiomer;<br>
(c)	acylating the phenolic hydroxy group of the product of step (b) to produce the corresponding isobutyric acid ester;<br>
(d)	and where desired or necessary, converting the resulting compound into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt.<br>
Fesoterodine, having chemical name 2-[(lR)-.3-[bis(l-methylethyl)amino]-l-phenylpropyl]-4-hydroxymethylphenyl isobutyrate or alternatively R-(+)-isobutyric acid 2-(3-diisopropylamino-l-phenyIpropyl)-4-hydroxymethylphenyl ester, is disclosed in European Patent 1077912 (see page 32 line 5 and claim 4, 3rd compound). It is indicated in the treatment of overactive bladder.<br><br>
In this third aspect, the resolution is preferably carried out by fractional crystallization with a chiral acid, preferably (R)-(-)-acetoxy(phenyl)acetic acid.<br>
The acylating agent is preferably isobutyryl chloride.<br>
The compound of formula (I) may exist in an open-ring form, although it is believed to exist predominantly in the closed-ring (lactol) form. Furthermore, it is believed that the process according to the first aspect of the invention produces a mixture of diastereoisomers of the lactol:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
(I) The R- and S-enantiomers of the chiral centre marked with an asterisk above are believed to be present in equal amounts. The production of all these tautomeric and stereoisomeric forms is embraced by the present invention.<br>
When piperazine is used in step (i) of the first aspect of the invention, the reaction proceeds via an isolable intermediate compound of formula (V),<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
wherein Y is selected from CH3, CH2OH, CH2CH2OH, CH2Br and Br. These compounds are provided according to a fourth aspect of the present invention. Preferably, Y is CH3.<br>
When N-methylpiperazine is used in step (i) of the first aspect of the invention, the reaction proceeds via an intermediate compound of formula (VI)<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
wherein Y is selected from CH3, CH2OH, CH2CH2OH, CH2Br and Br. These compounds are provided according to a fifth aspect of the present invention. Preferably, Y is CH2OH.<br>
The invention further provides a compound of formula (I),<br>
 (Formula Removed) <br>
wherein Y is selected from CH2CH2OH, CH2Br and Br.<br>
The process according to the invention differs from US Patent Application 2003/0236438 (see above) in that none of the reactants are an aniline compound, and the compound of formula (II) according to the invention does not have an additional strongly activating or strongly electron-donating group present (such as methoxy in Example 2 of US Patent Application 2003/0236438). Furthermore, the amine catalysts used in the present invention are much simpler (e.g. they do not need to be chiral) and hence cheaper.<br>
The process according to the invention differs from the Jurd paper mentioned above (Journal of Heterocylic Chemistry, vol 28 (4), 1991, pp 983-986) in that none of the reactants are an aniline compound, and the compound of formula (II) according to the invention does not have an additional strongly activating or strongly electron-donating group present, such as alkoxy or hydroxy.<br>
The invention has the further advantage that, as part of a process for the production of tolterodine, in comparison with the process disclosed by WO 98/29402, a number of reaction and processing steps are eliminated, leading to a reduction in costs. Furthermore, the process avoids the use of expensive reducing agents such as diisobutylaluminium hydride (DIBAL), sodium bis(2-methoxyethoxy)aluminium hydride or lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminohydride, which are also difficult to dispose of<br>
The invention has the further advantage that, as part of a process for the production of fesoterodine, in comparison with the processes disclosed in the prior art, a number of reaction and processing steps are eliminated, leading to a reduction in costs. Furthermore, the process avoids the use of hazardous and environmentally undesirable reagents, which are diflHcult to dispose of.<br>

Example 1<br>
Synthesis of 3.4-Dihvdro-6-methvl-4-phenvl-2H-benzopvran-2-ol<br>
(Formula Removed)  <br><br>
p-Cresol (150g, 1.387mol) was stirred with piperazine (72g, 0.832mol, 0.6eq) in toluene (1.5L, lOml/g) and then heated at reflux under Dean &amp; Stark conditions for at least 30 minutes to remove water giving a clear pale yellow solution. Trans-Cinnamaldehyde (262ml, 275g, 2.081 mol, 1.5eq) was then added over 2 hours whilst maintaining the reaction mixture at reflux under Dean &amp; Stark conditions. Once the addition was complete, heating of the reaction mixture was continued at reflux under Dean &amp; Stark conditions for a further 4 hours. The black solution was allowed to cool to 80°C and then slowly quenched over 45 minutes with a solution of 0.67M HCl(aq) (750ml, 0.601 mol, 1.3eq). The two-phase solution was then stirred vigorously for at least 12 hours at a temperature of 75-80°C. The stirring was then stopped and the mixture allowed to cool to room temperature and the phases separated. The toluene solution was then washed with IM HCl(,q) (750ml, 5ml/g), then water (3 X 750ml, 5ml/g). The 3,4-dihydro-6-methyl-4-phenyl-2H-benzopyran-2-ol was not isolated but instead the toluene solution was used directly in the reductive amination step (Example 2).<br>
Example 2<br>
Synthesis of Tolterodine L-Tartrate<br><br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
moist solution comprising crude 3,4-dihydro-6-methyl-4-phenyl-2H-benzopyran-2-ol from Example 1 (theoretical = 333.3g in 1.5L of toluene) was diluted with methanol (750ml, 5ml/g), then diisopropylamine (583ml, 42 1g, 4.161 mol, 3eq) was added.  The<br><br>
black solution was then hydrogenated over 20wt% Pd(OH)2/C moist (10wt%, 33g) at 621x103 Nm-2 (90 psi) and 110°C for 48 hours. A sample was removed for analysis.<br>
The reaction mixture was filtered through ArboceFTM (filter aid) to remove catalyst residues and then heated to reflux and all diisopropylamine and methanol removed by distillation and replaced with toluene resulting in a final volume of lOml/g. The black solution was then cooled to 25°C, acetone (750L, 5ml/g) was added, and then the solution heated to 55-60°C. A solution of L-Tartaric acid (312g, 2.081mol, 1.5eq) in methanol (1.05L, 7ml/g) was added over 30 minutes maintaining the temperature at 55-60°C. The resulting suspension was then allowed to cool to room temperature and stirred for 12 hours. The suspension was filtered, washed with acetone (2 X 600ml, 4ml/g), then dried in a vacuum oven at 50°C for 12 hours to give the title compound as an off white solid [159.2g, 48% (24% from p-Cresol)]. Achiral purity was 100% (no impurities detected) and chiral purity was 91.4% e.e.<br>
Example 3<br>
Synthesis of racemic tolterodine hydrochloride<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
To a solution of p-cresol (25 g, 0.i231 mol, 1 equiv), piperazine (11.94 g, 0.139 moi, 0.6 equiv) and toluene (250ml, 10 ml/g) at reflux under Dean &amp; Stark conditions was added cinnamaldehyde (45.83 g, 44 ml, 0.347 mol, 1.5 equiv) over a 2 hour period and reaction mixture monitored by HPLC for the presence of p-cresol.   Upon completion (2 to 3<br>
hours), the mixture was cooled to 80°C and a solution of c.HCl (25 ml, 0.301 mol, 1.3 equiv) in water (100ml, 5 ml/g) was slowly added and heated at 80-90°C for at least 5 hours. The resulting solution was allowed to cool to room temperature and the phases separated. The toluene solution was washed with 1M HCl (125 ml, 5 ml/g), then water (3 X 125 ml). The resulting organic layer was taken into the reductive amination step (Step B) as a crude mixture.<br>
Step B.	Preparation of racemic tolterodine hydrochloride<br>
To the crude solution from Step A was added methanol (125 ml, 5 ml/g cresol) and diisopropylamine (92 ml, 0.693mol, 3 equiv). The mixture was then hydrogenated over 20wt% Pd(OH)2/C wet (5.6 g, I0wt% theory of the benzopyran-2-ol) at 110 °C under 586x103 Nm-2 (85 psi) hydrogen pressure. Reaction progress was monitored by HPLC (completion usually occurs between 16 and 24h). Upon completion, the mixture was cooled, purged with nitrogen, filtered and washed with toluene (2 X 25 ml). The filtrate was then azeotroped with toluene to remove all methanol and diisopropylamine to end at a final volume corresponding to lOml/g cresol. The solution was then stirred at 50-60°C and 37% HCl (19.3 ml, 0.231 mol, 1.0 equiv c.f cresol) was added resulting in the precipitation of racemic tolterodine hydrochloride. The suspension was cooled to 25 °C and stirred for 2h, then filtered and washed with toluene (2 X 50ml). Racemic tolterodine hydrochloride was then dried under vacuum at 50°C. Yield was 52.7 g, 63% from p-cresol with achiral purity of 97%.<br>
The synthesis of tolterodine L-tartrate according to the methods of Examples 1-3 is shown in Scheme 2 below.<br>

Influence of amine catalyst and solvent on yield of 3.4-Dihvdro-6-metbvl-4-phenvl-2H-<br>
benzopvran-2-ol<br>
The reaction of Example 1 was repeated, but varying the amine catalyst and the solvent. The temperature used was approximately lOOX or the reflux temperature of any solvent if lower (unless indicated otherwise). Dean-Stark conditions were not used unless indicated (by *). The yields are shown in the following table. <br>

(Formula Removed) <br>
The preparation of the title compound was carried out using the procedure of Example 1, except for the omission of a quench with aqueous acid. Instead, upon completion of the reaction the mixture was allowed to cool to ambient temperature resulting in a brown suspension. Filtration of this suspension gave a brown solid with 'H and 13C NMR providing confirmation of the structure. Melting point: 241°C.<br>
