				<td>The present invention relates to a method for producing a UV screening composition.<br>
The present invention relates to UV screening compositions suitable for cosmetic and topical pharmaceutical use.<br>
The effects associated with exposure to sunlight are well known. Thus exposure of the skin to UVA and UVB light may result in, for example, sunburn, premature ageing and skin cancer.<br>
Commercial sunscreens generally contain components which are able to reflect and/or absorb UV light. These components include, for example, inorganic oxides such as zinc oxide and titanium dioxide as well as organic sunscreen agents.<br>
The general public are generally more concerned by the obvious effects of sunlight, namely sunburn which causes reddening of the skin than they are with other effects of sunlight which are less self evident. As a consequence of this commercial sunscreen compositions are rated by a Sun Protection Factor (SPF). This is a measure of the time taken for skin to redden under a layer of the composition as compared with untreated skin. Thus an SPF of 20 indicates that skin will take 20 times longer to redden under a layer of the composition applied at 2mg per cm2 compared with untreated skin. This reddening effect is caused principally by UVB light There is no recognised corresponding factor for the effects of UVA light even though the latter may be more damaging in the long term.<br>
Most organic sunscreen agents absorb light over only a part of the UVA-UVB spectrum with the result that if one is to obtain a screening effect covering the whole UVA-UVB spectrum it is generally necessary to use a combination of different organic sunscreen agents. Some organic sunscreen agents and other components of sunscreen compositions are stable to UV light but others are photosensitive and/or may after being excited by UV light degrade, and/or induce degradation of, another  ingredient of the composition.<br>
Titanium dioxide and abac oxide are generally formulated as "micronised" or 'ultrafine" (20-50 nm) particles (so called microreflectors) because particles whose size is less than 10% of the wavelength of the incident light scatter light according to Rayleigh's Law, whereby the intensity of scattered light is inversely proportional to<br><br>
the fourth power of the wavelength. Consequently, they scatter UVB light (with a<br>
wavelength of from 280 or 290 to315/ 320 nm) and UVA light (with a wavelength of<br>
from 315/320 to 400 nm) more than the longer, visible wavelengths, preventing<br>
sunburn whilst remaining invisible on the skin:<br>
However, titanium dioxide and zinc oxide also absorb UV light efficiently,<br>
leading via the initial formation of electron hole pairs to the formation of superoxide<br>
and hydroxyl radicals and which may in turn initiate damage to other components of<br>
the composition. The crystalline forms of TiO2, anatase and rutile, are<br>
semiconductors with band gap energies of about 3.23 and 3.06 eV respectively,<br>
corresponding to light of about 385 nm and 400 nm (1 eV corresponds to 8066 cm'1).<br>
Indeed there is evidence to suggest that TiO2 can enhance the degradation of<br>
organic sunscreen agents, including UVA organic sunscreens, for example<br>
avobenzone. Attempts have been made to reduce the adverse effects of TiO2 and<br>
ZnO by coating but coatings are not invariably effective. â€¢<br>
The reason why most sunscreen agents do not have a substantially perpetual<br>
effect (i.e. an SPF factor which remains substantially constant) is principally because<br>
the organic sunscreen agents are degraded by light and/or are adversely affected by<br>
other components of the sunscreen composition once the latter are subjected to UV<br>
light.<br>
It has now surprisingly been found, according to the present invention, that<br>
the degradation of organic sunscreen agents, and other components which are<br>
susceptible to degradation, can be retarded if the compositions also have present zinc<br>
oxide or titanium dioxide which has been doped with another element and/or<br>
reduced zinc oxide. In other words by using, in a cosmetic or topical pharmaceutical<br>
composition, these doped or reduced materials rather than ordinary titanium dioxide<br>
or zinc oxide it is, for example, possible either to provide a composition which gives<br>
better protection against UV light for the same quantity of organic sunscreen agent or<br>
a composition having the same screening effect against UV light but containing a<br>
smaller quantity of organic sunscreen agent. Indeed it is possible to provide all day<br>
protection sunscreens by incorporating the doped and/or reduced materials.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a cosmetic UV sunscreening composition<br>
suitable for cosmetic or topical pharmaceutical use which comprises an amount of<br>
one or more organic components which are photosensitive and/or which are degraded<br>
and/or in which degradation is induced by another ingredient of the composition and<br>
' an amount of TiO2 and/or ZnO which has been doped with one or more other<br>
elements, typically a second element, and/or reduced zinc oxide, this composition<br>
having a rate of loss of UV absorption at least 5% less than that of a composition<br>
having the same formulation except that it does not contain the said TiO2 and/or<br>
ZnO which has been doped with another element or reduced zinc oxide. Thus if the<br>
rate of loss of UV absorption (during UV exposure) over at least a proportion of the<br>
UVA and/or UVB spectrum is X then the amount of the organic component (s)<br>
which are photosensitive and/or which are degraded by another ingredient of the<br>
composition possesses a said rate of loss of Y where Y is greater than X by at least 5%,<br>
and the amount of doped TiO2 and/or ZnO and/or reduced zinc oxide reduces the<br>
said rate of loss from Y to X.<br>
The present invention also provides the use of a doped TiO2/ZnO or reduced<br>
zinc oxide to reduce the concentration of one or more organic UV sunscreen or other<br>
photosensitive ingredient or ingredient which is degraded by another ingredient of<br>
the composition in a cosmetic UV screening composition as well as to reduce the rate<br>
of loss in UV absorption of a sunscreen composition containing one or more organic<br>
UV sunscreen agents. The present invention further provides a method of increasing<br>
the effectiveness (improve the stability) of an organic sunscreening composition<br>
which comprises one or more components which are photosensitive and/or which are<br>
degraded and/or in which degradation is induced by another ingredient of the<br>
composition which comprises incorporating into the composition a doped TiO2/ZnO<br>
and/or reduced zinc oxide. Sometimes the degradation products (breakdown<br>
chemicals) are toxic. Accordingly, the present invention also provides a method of<br>
reducing the production of toxic compounds in a UV sunscreening composition<br>
which comprises incorporating therein a doped TiO2/ZnO and/or reduced ZnO.<br>
By "UV sunscreening composition suitable for cosmetic or topical<br>
pharmaceutical use" is meant any cosmetic or topical pharmaceutical composition<br>
having UV sunscreening activity Le. it includes compositions whose principal<br>
function may not be sunscreening. The term "topical pharmaceutical" is used since,<br>
in some jurisdictions, the term "cosmetic" does not extend to compositions having a<br>
pharmaceutical effect. It will be appreciated that the doped TiO2/ZnO or reduced<br>
ZnO may be the only ingredient of the composition having UV sunscreening activity<br>
i.e. the composition need riot necessarily contain an organic UV sunscreen agent. It<br>
is to be understood that the composition can also contain TiO2 and/or ZnO which<br>
has not been doped or reduced.<br>
The organic component which is photosensitive or may be degraded by<br>
another ingredient of the composition is generally a.UV sunscreen agent. Although<br>
all organic sunscreen agents which suffer a loss in UV absorption can be used, the<br>
present invention is particularly useful for agents which absorb in the UVA region as<br>
well as in the UVB region.<br>
However, other organic components may also be susceptible to free radical<br>
attack with the degraded component potentially inducing degradation of the UV<br>
sunscreen agent.<br>
As indicated above the UV absorption of an organic sunscreen agent<br>
generally decreases with time. In contrast the UV absorption of TiOz or ZnO does<br>
not decrease with time. Since Ti02 and ZnO absorb in both the UVA and UVB<br>
region whereas an organic sunscreen agent is generally more wavelength specific it<br>
can be seen that the UVA/UVB absorption ratio may increase over time. When a<br>
doped TiO2/ZnO is used rather than the same quantity of undoped Ti02/ZnO the rate<br>
of change is reduced. This is because the doped material will enhance the<br>
performance of the organic sunscreen agent over time. Thus with a UVA sunscreen<br>
the loss of UVA absorption over time is reduced (i.e. the UVA response is more<br>
stable when the doped material is present) so that the ratio of change of the rates is<br>
"Y" , where x<br>
reduced. Thus if the initial ratio of absorption is â€”, it becomes<br>
is smaller when a doped material is used, with the result that the rate of change is<br>
less. With a UVB sunscreen, the rate of change is also reduced as a consequence of a<br>
more stable UVB response.<br>
The rate of loss of absorption can be determined by illuminating a sample of<br>
the composition with and without the doped TiO2 and/or ZnO of defined thickness<br>
with UV light of the appropriate wavelength and determining the absorption of UV<br>
by the composition over a given period, typically 60 minutes, obtaining a plot over<br>
that period for the wavelengths in question and determining the area under the curve<br>
from which the rate of loss can be calculated. Clearly the smaller the area under the<br>
curve the smaller the loss. For UVA absorption wavelengths from 320 to 400, .<br>
.especially from 340 to 390 nm, are considered.<br>
While any reduction in the loss of UV absorption is an advantage, it is<br>
generally desirable that the presence of the doped oxide should reduce the rate of<br>
UV absorption by an amount of at least a 5%, preferably at least 10%, more<br>
preferably at least 15%, especiaEy at least 20% and most preferably at least 40%.<br>
A further feature of the present invention resides in the fact that the doped<br>
TiO2/ZnO is generally coloured. As a result the use of such doped materials causes<br>
the composition to absorb more of the visible light which impinges upon it i.e. less<br>
visible light is transmitted and reaches the skin. Further in certain countries coloured<br>
formulations-are advantageous. In skin lightening compositions in Japan, a pink<br>
colouration is useful in masking uneven colouration of the underlying skin. In<br>
Indonesia a yellow colouration can be seen as attractive. If, though, colour is to be<br>
minimised this can be achieved by coating the particles and/or by controlling the<br>
concentration of doping, both as discussed below.<br>
The optimum amount of the other element in the host lattice may be<br>
determined by routine experimentation and in some embodiments is preferably low<br>
enough so that the particles are not coloured. Amounts as low as 0.1 mole % or less,<br>
for example 0.05 mole %, or as high as 1 mole % or above, for example 5 mole % or<br>
10 mole %, can generally be used. Typical concentrations are from 0.5 to 2 mole %'<br>
by weight.<br>
The dopant for the oxide particles is preferably manganese, which is especially<br>
preferred, e.g. Mn2+ but especially Mn3+,vanadium, for example V3+ or V5+,<br>
chromium and iron but other metals which can be used include nickel, copper, tin,<br>
aluminium, lead, silver, zirconium, zinc, cobalt, gallium, niobium, for example Nb5'1",<br>
antimony, for example Sb3+, tantalum, for example Ta5+, strontium, calcium,<br>
magnesium, barium, molybdenum, for example Mo3+, Mo5+ or Mo6+ as well as silicon.<br>
Manganese is preferably present as Mn3+, cobalt as Co2+, tin as Sn4+ as well as Sn2+.<br>
These metals can be incorporated singly or in combination of 2 or 3 or more. Further<br>
details of these doped oxides can be found in WO99/60994 as well as WOO 1/40114.<br>
These particles can be obtained by any one of the standard processes for<br>
preparing doped oxides and salts. Thus they can be obtained by a baking technique<br>
by combining particles of a host lattice (TiO2/ZnO) with a second component in the<br>
form of a salt such as a chloride or an oxygen-containing anion such as a perchlorate<br>
or a nitrate, in solution or suspension, typically in solution in water, and then baking<br>
it, typically at a temperature of at least 300Â°C. Other routes which may be used to<br>
prepare the doped materials include a precipitation process of the type described in J&gt;<br>
Mat. Sci. (1997) 36, 6001-6008 where solutions of the dopant salt and of an alkoxide<br>
of the host metal (Ti/Zn) are mixed, and the mixed solution is then heated to convert<br>
the alkoxide to the oxide. Heating is continued until a precipitate of the doped<br>
material is obtained. Further details of preparation can be found in the aforesaid<br>
patent specifications.<br>
Doped TiO2 or doped ZnO can also be obtained by flame pyrolysis or by<br>
plasma routes where mixed metal containing precursors at the appropriate level are<br>
exposed to a flame or plasma to obtain the desired product.<br>
The rutile form of titania is known to be more photostable than the anatase<br>
form and is therefore preferred.<br>
Reduced zinc oxide particles (i.e. particles which possess an excess of zinc<br>
ions relative to the oxygen ions) may be readily obtained by heating zinc oxide<br>
particles in a reducing atmosphere to obtain reduced zinc oxide particles which<br>
absorb UV light, especially UV light having a wavelength below 390 nm, and re-emit<br>
in the green, preferably at about 500 nm. It will be understood that the reduced zinc<br>
oxide particles will contain reduced zinc oxide consistent with minimising migration<br>
to the surface of the particles of electrons and/or positively charged holes such that<br>
when said particles are exposed to UV light in an aqueous environment the<br>
production of hydroxyl radicals is substantially reduced as discussed above.<br>
The reducing atmosphere can be air with a reduced oxygen content or an<br>
increased hydrogen content but is preferably a mixture of hydrogen and an inert gas<br>
such as nitrogen or argon. Typically the concentration of hydrogen is from 1 to 20%,<br>
especially 5 to 15%, by volume, with the balance inert gas, especially nitrogen. A<br>
preferred reducing atmosphere is about 10% hydrogen and about 90% nitrogen by<br>
volume. The zinc oxide is heated in this atmosphere at, say, 500 Â° to 1000Â°C,<br>
generally 750 to 850Â°C, for example about 800Â°C, for 5 to 60 minutes, generally 10<br>
to 30 minutes. Typically it is heated to about 800 Â°C for about 20 minutes.<br>
It is believed that the reduced zinc oxide particles possess an excess of Zn2+<br>
ions within the absorbing core. These are localised states and as such may exist<br>
within the band gap. A further discussion of this can be found in WO 99/60994.<br>
The average primary particle size of the particles is generally from about 1 to<br>
200 nm, for example about 1 to 150 nm, preferably from about 1 to 100 nm, more<br>
preferably from about 1 to 50 nrn and most preferably from about 20 to 50 nm. The<br>
particle size is preferably chosen to avoid colouration of the final product. Thus<br>
nanoparticles are frequently used. However, in one embodiment slightly larger<br>
particles for example from 100 to 500 nm, typically 100 to 400 or 450 mm especially<br>
from 150 to 300 nm and particularly 200 to 250 nm, can be employed. These provide<br>
good coverage of, for example, skin imperfections without unacceptable skin<br>
whitening.<br>
Where particles are substantially spherical then particle size will be taken to<br>
represent the diameter. However, the invention also encompasses particles which are<br>
non'Spherical and in such cases the particle size refers to the largest dimension.<br>
The oxide particles used in the present invention may have an inorganic or<br>
organic coating. For example, the particles may be coated with oxides of elements<br>
such as aluminium, zirconium or silicon, especially silica. The particles of metal oxide<br>
may also be coated with one or more organic materials such as polyols, amines,<br>
alkanolamines, polymeric organic silicon compounds, for example,<br>
RSi[{OSi(Me)2}xOR1]3 where Ris CrC10 alkyl, R1 is methyl or ethyl and x is an.<br>
integer of from 4 to 12, hydrophilic polymers such as polyacrylamide, polyacrylic acid,<br>
carboxymethyl cellulose and xanthan gum or surfactants such as, for example,<br>
TOPO. Such coatings can have the effect of masking, at least to some extent, any<br>
colour which the doped particles may have.<br>
The compositions of the present invention are generally for cosmetics use and<br>
may be, for example, lipsticks, skin anti-ageing compositions in the form of, for<br>
example, creams, including anti-wrinkle formulation exfoliating preparations<br>
including scrubs, creams and lotions, skin lightening compositions in the form of, for<br>
example, face powders and creams, preparations for the hands including creams and<br>
lotions, moisturising preparations, compositions for protecting the hair such as<br>
conditioners, shampoos and hair lacquers as well as hair masks and gels, skin<br>
cleansing compositions including wipes, lotions and gels, eye shadow and blushers,<br>
skin toners and serums as well as washing products such as shower gels, bath products<br>
including bubble baths, bath oils, but, preferably, sunscreens. In this connection we<br>
should point out that the expression "cosmetic UV sunscreening composition", as<br>
used herein, includes any composition applied to the skin which may leave a residue<br>
on the skin such.as some washing products. Compositions of the present invention<br>
may be employed as any conventional formulation providing protection from UV<br>
light. The compositions may also be pharmaceutical compositions suitable for topical<br>
application. Such compositions are useful, in particular, for patients suffering from<br>
disorders of the skin which are adversely affected by UV light such those giving rise to<br>
polymorphous light eruptions.<br>
Organic sunscreen agents which can be used in the compositions of the<br>
present invention include any conventional sunscreen agent which gives protection<br>
against UV light while if there is no other photosensitive component the sunscreen<br>
agent is photosensitive and/or is degraded by another ingredient of the composition.<br>

moisturizing agents, and humectants such as glycerol, sorbitol, 2-pyrrolidone-5-<br>
carboxylate, dibutylphthalate, gelatin and polyethylene glycol, perfumes,<br>
preservatives, such as para-hydroxy benzoate esters, surface-active agents, fillers and<br>
diickeners, sequesterants, anionic, cationic, nonionic or amphoteric polymers or<br>
mixtures thereof, propellants, alkalizing or acidifying agents, colorants and powders,<br>
including metal oxide pigments with a particle size of from 100 nm to 20000 nm such<br>
as iron oxides along with conventional (undoped) TiO2 and ZnO.<br>
Other ingredients of cosmetic compositions, for example some surface-active<br>
agents may have the effect of degrading certain sunscreen agents in the presence of<br>
UV light. Also TiO2 and ZnO are known to degrade certain organic sunscreens such<br>
as avobenzone as well as antioxidants such as vitamins e.g. vitamins A, B, C and E<br>
and antiageing factors such as niacinamide, retenoids, coenzyme MEQi0 etc. It will<br>
be appreciated that it is particularly useful to use the doped TiO2 and/or ZnO and/or<br>
reduced ZnO with such sunscreens. This is because TiO2 and ZnO do generally have<br>
a positive UV absorptive effect. Thus by using the doped TiO2 and/or ZnO and/or<br>
reduced ZnO it may be possible to use less antioxidant or make the formulation<br>
longer lasting.<br>

especially hydrogenated palm oil, hydrogenated castor oil, vaseline oil, paraffin oil,<br>
Purcellin oil, silicone oil such as polydimethyl siloxanes and isoparaffin.<br>
The waxes are typically animal, fossil, vegetable, mineral or synthetic waxes.<br>
Such waxes include beeswax, Carnauba, Candelilla, sugar cane or Japan waxes,<br>

may further contain an emulsiner including anionic, nonionic, cationic or amphoteric<br>
surface-active agents; for a water-in-oil emulsion the HLB is typically from 1 to 6<br>
while a larger value i.e &gt;6 is desirable for an oil-in-water emulsion. Generally water<br>
amounts to up to 80%, typically 5 to 80%, by volume; Specific emulsifiers which can<br>
be used include sorbitan trioleate, sorbitan tristearate, glycerol monooleate, glycerol<br>

(20) sorbitol monolaurate, polyoxyethylene (23) lauryl ether, polyoxyethylene (50)<br>
monostearate, and PEG 4000 monostearate. Alternatively the emulsifier can be<br>
. silicone surfactant, especially a dimethyl polysiloxane with polypxyethylene and/or<br>
polyoxypropylene side chains, typically with a molecular weight of 10,000 to 50,000,<br>
especially cyclo-methicone and dimethicone copolyol. They may also be'provided in<br>
the form of vesicular dispersions of ionic or nonionic amphiphilic lipids prepared<br>
according to known processes.<br>
It can be advantageous to use both a water-dispersible and an oil-dispersible<br>
titanium dioxide or zinc oxide, at least one of which is doped or, in the case of zinc<br>
oxide, reduced. It has been found that when an emulsion is spread on the skin it has<br>
a tendency to break down into oily and non-oily areas. When the water evaporates<br>
the oil-dispersible particles will tend to be in the oily areas thus leaving areas<br>
unprotected. This can be avoided by having both hydrophilic and hydrophobic<br>
particles in the emulsion so that some are retained in hydrophilic areas and others in<br>
hydrophobic areas.<br>
Water-dispersible particles can be uncoated or Coated with a material to<br>
impart a hydrophilic surface property to the particles. Examples of such materials<br>
include aluminium oxide.and aluminum silicate. Oil-dispersible particles which<br>
exhibit a hydrophobic surface property, are suitably coated with metal soaps such as<br>
aluminium stearate, aluminium laurate or zinc stearate, or with organosilicone<br>
compounds.<br>
The following Examples further illustrate the present invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
The degradation of sunscreen formulations was assessed as follows:<br>
Methods:<br>
Preparation of sample<br>
Cut two strips of polythene 10mm x 25mm and 12.5 microns thick.<br>
Lay the polythene strips 20mm apart on the centre of a quartz slide.<br>
Pipette a drop of about 30ml of sunscreen preparation onto the centre of the slide.<br>
Carefully lay a second quartz slide on top of the sample and squeeze the slides<br>
together at the polythene strips thus providing a specimen 12.5um thick. Take care<br>
to avoid air bubbles.<br>
Illumination<br>
Use a Xenon lamp filtered with a Schott WG320 filter to carry out illuminations.<br>
Take a base reading of light output using a spectroradiometer calibrated between 290<br>
and 400 nm. .<br>
Measure the light intensity (290-400nm) through a sample of water to use as a blank<br>
(Iq). The intensity over the range 290 - 400 nm is typical of that found in moderate<br>
latitudes in mid-summer.<br>
Measure the light intensity (290-400nm) through the sample (It) at time 0 - as soon<br>
as it is put under the light - and then every 10 minutes for 1 hour.<br>
At the end of the experiment take another base reading of light output to ensure that<br>
the light source has remained steady.<br>
Calculations<br>
Calculate the transmission (K) of the sunscreen film at each individual wavelength:<br>
K = It/Iq<br>
This can be used to plot wavelength vs transmission at each timepoint and shows the<br>
increase in transmission of an individual sunscreen during illumination.<br>
The loss of light absorption (D) by the sunscreen at each individual wavelength is<br>
calculated as the proportion of the absorption of the sunscreen at T=0 still remaining<br>
at T=t:<br>
D= KO/Kt<br>
This can be used plot wavelength vs loss of light absorption. This plot allows<br>
comparisons to be made between different sunscreen preparations.<br>
By measuring the area under this curve at each time point the rate of change of the<br>
total UVA absorption can also be calculated.<br>
Formulations<br>
Commercial sunscreens Factor 5 and Factor 10. These have the following<br>
ingredients.<br>
The ingredients in italics are the active sunscreen agents.<br>
These formulations were modified by the incorporation of doped and undoped<br>
TiO2 and ZnO in various concentrations and compared with unmodified<br>
formulations.<br>

The results are shown in the attached Figures in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows the effect of time on absorption in UVA for a sunscreen<br>
formulation of factor 10 to which titanium dioxide, undoped or doped with 1%<br>
vanadium or manganese has been added.<br>
Figure 2 gives the average percentage loss for several formulations.<br>
Figure 3 shows the loss in absorption of a commercial factor 10 formulation in<br>
the UVA region at time = 0 up to t = 60.<br>
Figure 4 shows the degradation of a factor 5 formulation to which has been<br>
added titanium dioxide doped or undoped.<br>
Figure 5 shows the proportion of protection remaining for a commercial factor<br>
10 formulation to which zinc oxide, undoped or doped with 1% manganese or iron<br>
has been added.<br>
Figure 6 shows the average change in UVA absorption of a commercial factor<br>
10 formulation to which has been added zinc oxide undoped or doped with<br>
manganese or iron.<br>
Figure 7 shows the average change in UVA absorption for the same<br>
composition to which has been added TiO2 which has been doped with manganese or<br>
coated; and<br>
Figure 8 compares absorption as a function of wavelength for the invention<br>
with that for two commercially-available compositions.<br>
It can be seen that the addition of TiO2 and ZnO reduces the rate of degradation,<br>
this being due partly to scattering and partly to additional absorption. TiO2 or ZnO<br>
which is doped with manganese and vanadium, in particular, has a significantly greater<br>
effect in that the rate of loss of UV protection is reduced. Commercial Factor 10 was<br>
modified by the incorporation of ordinary or reduced ZnO of similar physical properties<br>
at 5% and compared. These materials were irradiated as described. The UVA<br>
absorption was recorded as a function of time to a total of 60 minutes. Each formulation'<br>
containing reduced or ordinary zinc oxide showed about 2% transmission at time zero.<br>
The reduced zinc oxide however showed a reduced rate of loss of UVA absorption as a<br>
function of UV light exposure with a rate of loss of about 12% for ordinary zinc oxide<br>
and rate of loss of about 8% for reduced zinc oxide.<br>
Example 2<br>
A comparison .was made between formulations differing solely in the nature of the<br>
TiO2 incorporated; their absorbance was then measured.<br>
The sunscreen formulations were based on a procedure by Stanley Black<br>

particle size 20-30 nm; crystal form 99% rutile; no coating<br>
B. Uvinul from BASF<br>

C. MT1OOAQ from Tayca Corp<br>
Primary particle size - 15nm<br>

Coating - Alumina/silica/algimc acid at up to 30%<br>
The results obtained are shown in Figure 8 which gives the degree of absorbance at<br>
different wavelengths for the 3 compositions. It is noticeable that the doped TiC*2 results<br>
in a significant increase in absorbance at around 360nm, i.e. in the UVA region as<br>
compared with the two commercial undoped materials. In consequence by using such a<br>
doped TiO2 it is possible to reduce the concentration of UVA sunscreen, organic or<br>
inorganic3 in the fonnulation and/or to increase the effectiveness of the formulation<br>
against UVA radiation.<br><br><br><br>
