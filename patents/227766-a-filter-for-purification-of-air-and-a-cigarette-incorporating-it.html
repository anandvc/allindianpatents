				<td>PROCESS FOR PRODUCTION AN OPEK CELLED FOAM<br>
A FILTER FOR PURIFICATION OF AIR AND A CIGARETTE<br>
INCORPORATING IT<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The invention relates to a foam for purifying and filtrating air, particularly<br>
filtrating toxic compounds, such as for instance tar and polycyclic aromatic<br>
hydrocarbons (PAHs) from tcbacco smoke, and to a method to prepare this<br>
foam.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The most important filter material used worldwide for purifying and filtrat-<br>
ing tobacco smoke, is cellulose acetate that may or may not be used in<br>
combination with activated carbon.<br>
. The usual filter materials, such as cellulose acetate and activated carbon,<br>
have the drawback of not removing a considerable part of the toxic<br>
compounds, such as tar and PAHs, present in tobacco smoke.<br>
Furthermore a cigarette filter is described in British patent specification GB<br>
755.057, which filter is formed from a urea formaldehyde foam having a<br>
fine foam structure containing cavities that are connected to each other so<br>
that tobacco smoke can flow through them., a filtration effect arising with<br>
respect to tar and nicotine present in the smoke.<br>
The foam from GB 755.057 is prepared by first foaming a foamable liquid<br>
by injection of into it or by surring it. Subsecuentiy the foamed liquid is<br>
transformed into a durable foam by admixing urea, formaldehyde and a<br>
suitable cetalyst with the liquid. Alter that the prepared foam is treated<br><br>
with an excess of an aqueous urey solution, in oder to thus remove the<br>
smell of formalin,<br>
Subsequently the foam treated with the urea solution is subjected to a<br>
compression process in order to increase the mechanical stability of the<br>
foam and at the same time to ensure that at least some of the hollow<br>
spaces remain intercommunicating. In this way, according to GB 755.057,<br>
a foam material having a skeleton-like fine structure and intricate shape is<br>
produced, comprising a plurality of flow ducts, a relatively low flow<br>
resistance and a substantially improved mechanical stability. Said fine<br>
structure filtrates the aerosol particles that are carried along by the smoke.<br>
A drawback of the method of preparation according to GB 755.057 is that<br>
in the first step, that is to say the foaming of a foamable liquid, mixing<br>
takes place under ill-controllable conditions. As a result it is not possible to<br>
form a foam of a well-defined structure under well-controlled conditions.<br>
Indeed the structure of the foam is of importance to the filtration effect<br>
with regard to tar and nicotine from tobacco smoke. It apoeared to applicant<br>
that the structure of the foam prepared with the method according<br>
to GB 755.057 is not sufficiently effective to filtrate tar and nicotine from<br>
tobacco smoke. For instance the aforementioned structure does indeed<br>
comprise cavities, however including closed cavities which are not accessible<br>
to the aerosol particles curried along by the smoke.<br>
Another drawback of the method of preparation according to GE 755.057<br>
is that after preparation of the urea formaldehyde-based foam, said foam<br>
has yet to be subjected to a compression process in order to obtain a well-<br>
filtrating loam for a cigarette filter, by breaking the walls of the cavities.<br>
Furthermore, in the Italian patent specification IT 574.416 a method for<br>
preparing a urea resin filter mass for the removal of nicotine and tar and<br><br>
other products from tobacco smoke is described, of said method a mixture<br>
of a urea formaldehyde solution, a foaming agent, an acid and finely powdered<br>
SiO2 gel is stirred until a thick foam iorrns, which is then allowed to<br>
solidify and is dried. SiO2 gel is a strong nicotine-bonding agent.<br>
A drawback of the method according to IT 574,416 is that a SiO2 gel has<br>
to be used to obtain a sufficient filtration effect for the final foam product.<br>
Another drawback is that mixing takes place under ill-controllable condi-<br>
tions so that, just like in the method of preparation according to GB<br>
755.057, it is not possible to form a foam of well-defined structure.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a foam for purifying and filtrating<br>
air, particularly filtrating toxic compounds, such as for instance tar and<br>
PAHs, from tobacco smoke, the foam having such a structure that the<br>
poiiutions are filtrated from the air to a considerable degree.<br>
Surprisingly the above-mentioned object is achieved with a foam<br>
comprising cavities and interstitial spaces situated outside of the cavities,<br>
the cavities being defined by walls, the walls of the cavities being composed<br>
of a crosslinked polymer and possible additives, the average largest<br>
dimension of the cavities being in the range of 30-350 μm, a considerable<br>
part of the cavities comprising two or more perforations in their walls, the<br>
perforations having an average diameter in the range of 5-300 μm, a<br>
considerable part of the perforations of adjacent cavities being positioned<br>
with respect to each other such that a continuous, non-linear path is<br>
formed, the foam having a porosity of at least 45 vol.% the porosity being<br>
defined as the volume percentage, based on the total volume of the foam,<br>
of that part of the foam accessible to matter passing through the foam,<br>
and the foam having a specific surface in the range of 0.015 m2/g.<br>
The foam according to the invention has the advantage of having such a<br><br>
structure that the toxic compounds from tobacec smoke can be filtrated to<br>
a high degree. The advantageous use of the foam as filler material for<br>
cigarettes is further elucidated below.<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
Referring to figure 1 the structure of the foam according to the invention is<br>
described. Figure 1 regards a SEM recording with whicn the structure is<br>
shown in a three-dimensional manner.<br>
The structure of the foam according to the invention on the one hand<br>
comprises cavities, surrounded by walls, and on the other hand spaces<br>
situated outside of the cavities, so-called interstitial spaces.<br>
In the art of foaming the aforementioned cavities are also referred to as<br>
'bubbles', 'cells', 'spheres' and the like. The cavities of the foam according<br>
to the invention often do not have the ideal shape of a sphere. They may<br>
for instance also have an ellipsoidal, spheroidal or another rhermodynamically<br>
advantageous shape.<br>
The walls of the cavities; are composed of a crosslinked polymer and<br>
possible additives. In the art a crosslinked polymer is also referred to as<br>
'network polymer'. Preferably the crosslinked polymer is a synthetic<br>
organic copolymer, such as for instance a urea formaldehyde-based<br><br>
copolymer. The crosslinked oolymer may however aiso for instance be a<br>
polyurethane.<br>
A considerable part, preferably more than 90%, of the walls of the cavities<br>
of the foam according to the invention comprise two or more perforations.<br>
In the art such perforated cavities are also referred to as 'open cells', 'open<br>
spheres', 'pores' and the like. Furthermore cavities that do not comprise<br>
any perforation are referred ":o as 'closed cells', 'closed spheres' and the<br>
like. The percentage of closed cavities in the foam according to the<br>
invention is relatively low, preferably lower than 10%. Most preferably the<br>
foam comprises open cavities only. Furthermore, the foam also comprises<br>
a low percentage of cavities which only comprise one perforation, such<br>
cavities limiting the flow of tobacco smoke through a filter comprising the<br>
foam.<br>
The average largest dimension of the cavities in the foam according to the<br>
invention is in the range of 30-350 μm, preferably 50-250 μm. By 'largest<br>
dimension' is here meant the longest wall-to-wall distance within a cavity.<br>
The average diameter of the perforations in the walls of the cavities in the<br>
foam according to the invention is in the range of 5-300 μm, preferably 5-<br>
200 /vm, more preferably 10-200 μm and most preferably 10-100 μm. A<br>
considerable part, preferably more than 40% and particularly more than<br>
80%, of the perforations of adjacent cavities are positioned with respect to<br>
each other or connected to each other such that a continuous, non-linear<br>
path is formed. By 'continuous path' is meant that tobacco smoke can flow<br>
through a filter, comprising the foam according to the invention, from the<br>
beginning to the end cf the filter. By 'non-linear path' is meant that<br>
aforementioned flow path is not a straight duct but a winding path<br>
Without being limited by any theory, it it expected that an aerosol particle<br>
present in tobacco smoke, such as for instance a tar containing aerosol<br><br>
particle, traversing a continuous, non-linear path as defined above, can,<br>
after traversing a first cavity, be slowed down by colliding against the wall<br>
of a next cavity. Tobacco srnoke, that leaves the mouthpiece of a cigarette<br>
in the direction of the bronchial tubes, may contain 1O5-1O10 tar containing<br>
aerosol particles per ml, varying in diameter from 0.1 to 1.0 μm (Baker,<br>
1999). As a result the aerosol particle is able to adhere to the wall in the<br>
next cavity. Because of this the aerosol particle is incorporated in the<br>
cavity. It is not ruled out, however, that aerosol particles can also be<br>
incorporated in the interstitial spaces.<br>
As indicator in the quantitative sense for the filtration effect with regard to<br>
aerosol particles present in tobacco smoke of a foam, such as the foam<br>
according to the invention, the permeability of the foam can be used. Said<br>
permeability is determined by the filtration coefficient K.<br>
The filtration coefficient K according to the Kozeny-Carman relation<br>
depends on the following three parameters:<br><br>
in which k represents a measure of the winding o1 the flow path (or<br>
labyrinth factor), e represents the porosity and A,.., represents the; specific<br>
surface.<br>
As appears from the Kozeny-Carman relation shown above, the filtrating<br>
effect is predominantly determined by the porosity and the specific surface.<br>
The porosity of a foam is defined here as the volume percentage, based on<br>
the total volume of the foam, of that part of the foam accessible to matter<br>
passing through the foam, in a system solely consisting of closed spheres,<br>
the porosity solely regards the interstitial spaces stuated outside of the<br>
spheres. On the other hand in a system solely consisting of open spheres,<br><br>
the porosity regards both the interstitial spaces situated outside of the<br>
spheres and the spaces within the spheres themselves.<br>
The porosity, as defined above, can be measured by saturating a foam<br>
with for instance an organic solvent such as hexanol. It is subsequently<br>
determined how large the weight and volume of the solvent incorporated in<br>
the foam are. The percentual ratio of said determined volume with regard<br>
to the total volume of the foam, represents the porosity as defined above.<br>
The porosity of the foam according to the invention, as defined above and<br>
as determined in the manner described above;, is at least 45 vol.%. A<br>
porosity in the range of 45-99 vol.% is preferred. More preferably the<br>
porosity is at least 60 vol% or in the range of 80-99 vol.%.<br>
The specific surface of the foam according to the invention is 0.1-15 m2/g.<br>
Preferably the specific surface is in the range of 3-15 m2/g. The specific<br>
surface has been determined by means of nitrogen gas adsorption at<br>
-196°C according to the well known BET-method developed by Brunauer,<br>
Emmett and Teller.<br>
The above-mentioned quantitative parameters are no parameters by means<br>
of which the filtrating effect with regard to aerosol particles present in<br>
tobacco smoke of the foam according to the invention can be predicted<br>
with absolute certainty. All properties of the foam, both those that can<br>
only be expressed in qualitative sense and those that can also be<br>
expressed by quantitative parameters, contribute to said filtrating effect.<br>
The actual filtrating effect of the foam according 1c the invention has been<br>
determined by carrying out smoking experiments (see test examples).<br>
Below other properties of the foam according to the invention are discussed.<br><br>
The structure of the foam according to the invention is characterized in<br>
that it lacks orientation in it that means that the distribution of the size of<br>
the cavities over the entire structure is the same. Said distribution is a<br>
random distribution. This means that there is no regularity in the<br>
distribution of the size of the cavities. For instance the cavities do not all<br>
have one and the same value for the largest dimension, as defined above.<br>
On the contrary, said largest dimension varies from 30 to 350 μm.<br>
Therefore an 'average' largest dimension is meant here.<br>
What was discussed above regarding the distribution of the largest<br>
dimension of the cavities, also holds good for the distribution over the<br>
entire structure of the diameter of the perforations present in the wall of<br>
the cavities. Accordingly an 'average' diameter is meant here.<br>
The shape of the aforementioned perforations may in general be characterized<br>
by the length/width ratio. The shape of the perforations in the<br>
cavities of the foam according to the invention may vary from circular<br>
(isodiarnetric) to angular. Furthermore the length/width ratio of said<br>
perforations can be such that there can be question of a 'burst-like' shape<br>
of the perforations.<br>
The specific mass of the foam according to the invention in dry condition<br>
can be in the range of 5-100 Kg/m3. A specific mass in the range of 5-60<br>
or 10-30 kg/m2 is preferred. More preferably the specific mass is in the<br>
range of 10-50 kg/m3.<br>
The structure of the foam according to the invention is also determined by<br>
the method of its preparation, particularly' the method of mixing when<br>
foaming a foaming agent, in said method of mixing, in which air is mixed<br>
with the foaming agent, a plurality of inert mixing bodies having a certain<br>
dimension are used Glass, splerical mixing bodies, such as for instance<br>
glass beads, can be used as inert mixing bodied.<br><br>
When using relatively small beads, according to the invention a foam is<br>
formed of which a SEM recording is shown in figure 4 (bead diameter - 4<br>
mm). From figure 4 it appears that the proportion of the perforations in the<br>
surface of the walls of the cavities is relatively small.<br>
When using relatively large beads, according to the invention a foam is<br>
formed of which a SEM recording is shown in figure 5 (bead diameter =<br>
10 mm). From figure 5 it appears that the proportion of the perforations in<br>
the surface of the walls of the cavities is relatively large.<br>
It appeared to applicant that when using beads having a relatively very<br>
large diameter, for instance larger than 15 mm, the cavities are perforated<br>
to such a strong degree that a very thin foam is formed. A thin foam is a<br>
foam of which the walls of the cavities are not self-carrying. The mechan-<br>
ical stability of such a thin foam is relatively low. Additionally the specific<br>
surface decreases. The porosity remains almost the same. When using<br>
beads of a relatively very small diameter, for instance smaller than 2 mm,<br>
the opposite effect occurs, on the understanding that also the porosity<br>
remains almost the same.<br>
In the following a method is described that can be used for the preparation<br>
of the foam according to the invention.<br>
In the aforementioned method an injection device is used that is<br>
schematically shown in figure 6. In the art such ar injection device is also<br>
referred to a jet pipe.<br>
To a mixing part 7 of the aforementioned injection device under a certain<br>
pressure via an inlet 2. and a venture 4, air is supplied and via an intel 3 and<br>
a venture 6, a foaming agent solution is supplied. The mixing part 7 is tilled<br>
with a plurality of inert mixing bodies having dimensions in the range of 2<br>
to 15 mm (not shown in figure 6'. As mentioned above, glass, spnerical<br><br>
mixing bodies, such as for instance glass beads, can be used as inert,<br>
mixing bodies. Preferably glass beads having a diameter in the range of 4<br>
to 10 mm are used.<br>
In the mixing part 7 the foaming agent solution is foamed so that a non-<br>
cured foam is formed. This foam is led to a reaction part S. Simultaneously<br>
a prepolymer solution is supplied under a certain pressure to the reaction<br>
part 8 via an inlet 1 and a venture 5. A. crosslinking or polymerization<br>
catalyst, such as for instance an acid catalyst, may be supplied, preferably<br>
together with the foaming agent solution to the mixing part 7.<br>
As 'prepolymer' for instance a urea formaldehyde precondensate or for<br>
instance polyurethane forming reagents can be used. When a solution of a<br>
urea formaldehyde precondensate is used, an additional amount of urea is<br>
preferably incorporated in this solution (also see GB 755.057 discussed<br>
above). By varying the amount of additional urea, the density and<br>
brittleness of the foam can be adjusted.<br>
It is preferred to supply the foaming agent solution and the prepolymer<br>
solution to the injection device at an equal throughput speed (debit), resulting<br>
in a volume ratio between both solutions of 1:1. The aforementioned<br>
solutions may optionally comprise additives, such as additives tc improve<br>
the foaming properties of the foaming agent solution and/or improve the<br>
adsorption properties of the foam with regard to substances molecularly<br>
present in the gas phase, such as for instance surfactants. Other possible<br>
additives to for instance improve the adsorption properties are fillers and<br>
pigments, such as for instance silica gel, titanium oxide, activated carbon<br>
and the like.<br>
In the reaction part 8 s copclynerization reaction takes place by which a<br>
crosslinked polymer or network polymer is being termed. The non-cured<br>
foam is converted into a curable foam by this reaction. The specific struc-<br><br>
ture of the foam as formed in the mixing part. 7 and the reaction part 8 is<br>
then fixated.<br>
The curable foam formed in the reaction pari 8 finally leaves the injection,<br>
device via an outlet 9, at which moment the curable foam in the meantime<br>
may have been partially cured. Subsequently this foam is dried to the air<br>
and possibly after-heated at a temperature of approximately 40°C, so that<br>
a completely cured foam is formed and small polyformaldehyde residues<br>
that may still be present are removed.<br>
The foam according to the invention can be ground into a powder.<br>
Preferably such a powder has a particle size in the range of 0.1 to 2 mm.<br>
The powder can be incorporated as filter material in a filter for filtrating or<br>
purifying air in order to remove pollutions such as toxic compounds from<br>
the air. Instead of the powder also the non-ground foam as such can be<br>
incorporated as filter material in the filter.<br>
In addition to the foam or powder according to the invention a filter, as<br>
defined above, may also comprise organic polymer fibres, such as for<br>
instance cellulose acetate.<br>
Furthermore in a cigarette comprising a mouthpiece and a tobacco column<br>
and in which the mouthpiece is filled with a filter material, the foam or the<br>
powder according to the invention can be used as filter material, possibly<br>
in combination with organic polymer fibres, such as for instance cellulose<br>
acetate. Such a cigarette filter is for filtrating tar and nicotine and other<br>
toxic compounds like PAHs from tobacco smoke.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
In order to obtain the foam according to the invention liquids A and B were<br><br>
first prepared separately.<br>
Liquid A was prepared by nixing 25 kg of a water-soluble urea formal-<br>
dehyde precondensate (Basopor® 293 Pulver available from BASF Neder-<br>
land B.V.), 10 kg of urea and 100 liters of water while stirring for 2 hours<br>
at 35°C.<br>
Liquid B was prepared by mixing 5.5 liters of a foaming agent (Basomol®<br>
514 flussig available from BASF Nederland B.V., which is an aqueous<br>
solution comprising 25 % by weight of phosphoric acid and less than 10 %<br>
by weight of resorcino! and having a pH of 1-2), and 100 liters of water<br>
while stirring for approximate,y 30 minutes at 35CC.<br>
In order to prepare the foam according to the invention use was subse-<br>
quently made of an injection device as shown in figure 7, the general<br>
operation of which has been discussed above in connection with figure 6.<br>
The reference numbers mentioned in figure 7 have the same meaning as<br>
those in figure 6. The mixing part 7 from figure 7 was filled with glass<br>
beads having a diameter of approximately 7 mm.<br>
To the mixing part 7 at a temperature of approximately 35°C, liquid B<br>
under a pressure of 11.5 bar and at a throughput speed of 10 liter/minute<br>
via the inlet 3 and air under a pressure of 5.5 bar via the inlet 2 were<br>
supplied. Because of the mixing a non-cured foam was formed that was<br>
subsequently led to the reaction part 8 to which simultaneously via the<br>
inlet 1 liquid A was supplied under a pressure of 1 1.5 bar and at a throughput<br>
speed of 10 liter/minute. In the reaction part 8 a quick<br>
copolymerization reaction took place at a temperature of approximately<br>
35°C, which reaction was catalyzed by the acid catalyst preser.t in liquid<br>
E, so that a curable foam was formed.<br>
The foam that might have been partially cured, was discharged via the<br><br>
outlet 9 under atmospheric pressure, dried to the all and subsequently<br>
after-heated at a temperature of approximately 40°C, so that a completely<br>
cured, light-coloured foam was formed. Subsequently the cured foam was<br>
crumbled into a powder.<br>
A SEM recording was taken both from the powder and from the dried and<br>
after-heated foam. The SEM recordings for the powder and the foam<br>
showed a similar structure. The SEM recording for the foam is shown in<br>
figure 1.<br>
Subsequently a number of quantitative parameters for the foam were<br>
determined, in which the parameters were defined and determined in the<br>
manner described above.<br>
The foam had an average largest dimension of the cavities of approximately<br>
275 μm. The perforations in the walls of the cavities were<br>
essentially circular and had an average diameter of approximately 250 μm.<br>
Furthermore the foam had a porosity of approximately 65 vol.%, a specific<br>
surface of approximately 0.8 m2/g and a specific mass of approximately 20<br>
kg/rrr. The other structure properties of the foam in qualitative sense have<br>
already been discussed above.<br>
Example 2<br>
In this example the method as described in example 1 was used, with the<br>
exception that in the preparation of liquid A 2 kg of urea were used and<br>
that in the preparation of liquid B 115 liters of water were used.<br>
The foam thus obtained had an average largest dimension of the cavities of<br>
approximately 275 μm. The perforations in the walls of the cavities were<br>
essentially circular and had an average diameter of approximately 100 μm.<br>
Furthermore the foam had a porosity of approximately S7 vol.%, a specific<br>
surface of approximately 12 m2/g and a specific mass of approximately 20<br><br>
kg/m3. The other structure properties of the foam in qualitative sense have<br>
already been discussed above ,<br>
Example 3<br>
In this example a polyurethane foam was prepared as a foam according to<br>
the invention while using the method as described in example 1.<br>
Liquid A was an aqueous solution containing 25 kg of polyethylene glycol<br>
(molar mass of about 1000 g/mol), 9 kg of hexamethylene diisocyanate<br>
and 0.1 kg of triethylamine as catalyst. Liquid B was an aqueous solution<br>
containing 2 kg of 1,4-butapediol, 0.4 kg of 1,2,5-hexanetriol and 0.1 kg<br>
of triethylamine &amp;s catalyst. Liquids A and B had an equal volume of 100<br>
litres.<br>
Subsequently a number of quantitative parameters for the foam were<br>
determined, in which the parameters were defined and determined in the<br>
manner described above.<br>
The foam had an average largest dimension of the cavities of approximately<br>
300 μm, in which in additior to a plurality of interstitial spaces having a<br>
diameter of between 200 and 275 μm, large interstitial spaces having a<br>
diameter of approximately 1000 μm were also present. The perforations in<br>
the walls of the cavities essentially had an elongated or 'burst-like' shape<br>
having an average length of approximately 80 μm and an average width of<br>
approximately 20 μm. Said perforations therefore had an average diameter<br>
of 80-20 μm. Furthermore the foam had a porosity of approximately 52<br>
vol.%, a specific surface of approximately 4 m2/g and a specific mass of<br>
approximately 4 8 kg/m3. The relatively low value of the porosity indicates<br>
that this foam contains a considerable number of closed cavities.<br>
Comparative example 1<br>
in this comparative example a urea formaldehyde foam was prepared using<br><br>
the method described in GB 755.057.<br>
A SEM recording was made of the foam thus obtained which is shown in<br>
figure 3,<br>
Subsequently a number of quantitative parameters were determined for the<br>
foam, in which the parameters were defined and determined in the manner<br>
described above.<br>
The foam had an average largest dimension of the cavities of approximate-<br>
ly 35 μm, in which in addition to predominantly spaces having a largest<br>
dimension in the range of 30-50 μm, also very large spaces having a<br>
largest dimension in the range of 600-700 μm were present. Furthermore<br>
the foam had an average perforation diameter of approximately 30 μm, on<br>
the understanding that there were very few perforations in the walls of the<br>
cavities so that there was no question of a spatial continuum. That means<br>
that in the foam prepared in this comparative example none to very few<br>
perforations of adjacent cavities are positioned with respect to each other<br>
or connected to each other such that a continuous,, non-linear path is<br>
formed, which with the foam according to the invention is indeed the case.<br>
Finally the foam had a porosity of approximately 50 vol.%. a specific<br>
surface of approximately 7 m2/g and a specific mass of approximately SO<br>
kg/m3.<br>
Thus the structure of the foam prepared in this comparative example was<br>
considerably different from the structure of the foam according to the<br>
invention, like for instance with regard to the degree of the cavities being<br>
perforated, which has already been discussed above.<br>
Comparative example 2<br>
To compare the structure of the foam according to the invention to the<br>
structure of cellulose acetate, which is used as filler material in commer-<br><br>
cially available cigarette fibers, a SEM recording was made of sain cellulose<br>
acetate which is shown in figure 2.<br>
From figure 2 it appears that the cellulose acetate from the aforementioned<br>
cigarette filters has an irregular fibrous structure which clearly differs from<br>
the structure of the foam according to the invention that comprises<br>
perforated cavities.<br>
Test examples<br>
Test methods<br>
Cigarettes<br>
Experiments with tobacco smoke were carried out with filter cigarettes<br>
generally available in retail shops producing 12 mg of tar and 0.9 mg of<br>
nicotine, specified on the packaging. The mouthpiece arranged by the<br>
manufacturer consisted of a filter of 1 20 mg of cellulose acetate (below<br>
referred to as 'CA') in a paper casing. The CA filter was removed from the<br>
paper casing with a pair of tweezers and partially replaced by a powder of<br>
the foam according to the invention, such as a powder of the foam<br>
prepared in example 1 (below referred to as 'network polymer filter<br>
material' or 'NP material') or a powder of the foam prepared in example 3<br>
(below referred to as 'PU material',1.<br>
To that end the NP or PU material was manually reduced with a grater<br>
(boreholes of the grater 1.6-1.8 mm), subsequently dried for 16-20 hours<br>
at 40°C and placed in the original paper casing between the tobacco<br>
column and a halved (60 mg) CA filter on the mouthside. The filter cigarettes<br>
were provided in the mouthpiece with 15 or 30 mg, respectively, of<br>
network polymer or with 15 me of CU materia!. Said filters from now on<br>
are referred to ss NP-15 or NP-30, respectively, or PU-15. Said filler<br>
cigarettes were compared TO specimens of which the filter part in the<br><br>
mouthpiece (120 mg of CA) were completely left intact, Said filter will<br>
from now on be referred to es 'CA',<br>
Smoking experiments<br>
Filter cigarettes were experimentally smoked under continuous and discon-<br>
tinuous conditions using the "rest arrangements described below.<br>
Continuous smoking<br>
In the research into the effect of continuous smoking, the filter cigarettes<br>
were placed in a test arrangement shown in figure 8 which consisted of<br>
the following parts: water jet pump, flow meter, manometer and absolute<br>
filter.<br>
At the suction side, the water jet pump is connected to an artificial mouth-<br>
piece in the form of a butyl rubber hose having an internal diameter of 8<br>
mm suitable to the filter cigarettes used.<br>
With the flow meter (Sho Rate model 1355, Brooks Instruments BV,<br>
Veenendaal) the air debit was adjusted at 250-330 ml per minute at an<br>
average incineration period of 4.0 to 4.5 minutes and a remaining tobacco<br>
column of 3-5 mm above the filter. (Some experiments were carried out at<br>
500 ml per minute.)<br>
An absolute filter and a manometer are situated between the mouthpiece<br>
and the flow meter. The absolute filter consists of a detachable glass<br>
container with 200 mg of NP in it, which as may be expected is amply<br>
sufficient to remove all particles from tobacco smoke. It is possible with<br>
this absolute filter to determine the quantity of tar that is passed through<br>
the cigarette filter, so that the smoker's exposure to tar can be quantified.<br>
Discontinuous smoking<br>
A standard procedure for the determination of the tar content in discon-<br><br>
tinuous mechanically smoked cigarettes was originally developed in the<br>
nineteen thirties (Bradford, 1936). In 1969 said method was adopted as<br>
60/2/35 directive by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and has since<br>
been used as legal standard regulation (Pillsbury, 1969). In the present<br>
research said FTC method was used. 35 ml of air was sucked in once per<br>
minute for 2 seconds.<br>
The test arrangement used in discontinuous smoking is shown in figure 9.<br>
In these experiments 6 minutes of incineration period was used, resulting<br>
in on average 3-5 mm of remaining tobacco column above the filter. In the<br>
experiments use was mede of a 50 ml injection syringe with which per<br>
cigarette 35 ml of air was sucked in seven times which was discharged by<br>
means of a side opening. The butyl rubber mouthpiece used for the<br>
cigarette, absolute filter and manometer were the same as in the test<br>
arrangement described under 'continuous smoking'.<br>
From the literature (Djordjevic, 1997) it is known that using the FTC<br>
method on light-cigarettes is no longer representative for the smoking<br>
behaviour. Smoking such cigarettes having a nicotine content lower than<br>
0.9 mg (as mentioned on the packaging) may in practice give rise to a<br>
more frequent inhalation behaviour of smokers. The result is that the<br>
degree of exposure of the smoker's bronchial tubes to tar becomes higher<br>
than shown on the packaging. For that reason it is of importance to gain<br>
an understanding of the activity of the NP filter in case of more inhalations<br>
per minute.<br>
In the present research, for that reason the tar reduction when smoking<br>
according to the standard (60/2/35) FTC directive was compared to the<br>
reduction in a double (refenec to as 30/2/35 FTC directive) and a<br>
quadruple (referred to as 1(5/2/35 FTC directive) inhalation frequency<br>
thereof, respectively.<br><br>
Determination pressure drop_over the filter<br>
The average pressure drop over the filter cigarettes was measured during<br>
both continuous and discontinuous smoking tests, by an electronic<br>
manometer (R.S. Components Ltd, Corby, Northans, UK). Use was made<br>
here of a 120 ml buffer barrel connected in series with the smoking arran-<br>
gement without absolute filter. Said barrel was provided with a butyl<br>
rubber stopper and an aluminium shrink cap, so that the manometer could<br>
be connected via an injection needle.<br>
Determination of incineration ash of the particles in the smoke after<br>
passing a cigarette filter<br>
Of the smoke that passed the cigarette filter the particles were filtrated off.<br>
Of said particles the incineration ash was determined. This took place with<br>
filter cigarettes that were discontinuously smoked in 6 minutes according<br>
to the 60/2/35 FTC directive. The determination was carried out for the<br>
three filter systems: standard filter of 120 mg of cellulose acetate (CA<br>
control), 15 and 30 mg of network polymer plus 60 mg of CA.<br>
In the determination of the incineration ash, use was made of a flat filter<br>
(Whatman QM-A cross-section 37 mm) on which the solid phase was<br>
collected. The mass increase of the flat filter was determined by weighing,<br>
after 16-20 hours of drying at 40cC.<br>
Determination of tar<br>
Tar from tobacco smoke was extracted with organic solvents from suc-<br>
cessively cigarette mouth piece, butyl rubber hoses and absolute filter.<br>
The successive extractions of cigarette mouthpiece and absolute filter were<br>
carried out with a mixture of 20 ml of ethanol 96%, 20 ml of hexane and<br>
40 ml volume of acetone. The extraction was carried out in screw cap<br>
bottles (136 ml) provided with a teflon coated silicone insert cap. The butyl<br>
rubber mouthpiece, in which the cigarettes were placed during the ex-<br><br>
periments, was rinsed with triple 1 ml of acetone in the same screw cap<br>
bottle as the absolute filter.<br>
After the screw cap bottles had been placed on a shaking tray (180<br>
strokes a minute, amplitude 5 cm) for 30 minutes, the extracts were<br>
filtrated over a paper folded filter (Schleicher &amp; Schull roodband). The<br>
filtrate was collected in a porcelain tray (0 10 cm), the filter was<br>
subsequently rinsed three times with 20 ml of the same extraction liquid.<br>
After 16-20 hours of evaporation of the extraction liquid at 40°C and<br>
weighing the tar content per cigarette could be determined in which a<br>
correction for nicotine (0.9 mg/cigarette) and blank filter were taken into<br>
account. It was assumed that nicotine is completely or almost completely<br>
removed in the absolute filter.<br>
Determination of PAHs<br>
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were measured in tobacco smoke that<br>
had passed the cigarette filter. Tne filter cigarettes were smoked in 4.0-4.5<br>
minutes under continuous smoking conditions at an air debit of 500<br>
ml/min.<br>
Three filter systems were examined: standard filter of 120 mg of cellulose<br>
acetate (CA control;, 15 and 30 mg of network polymer (NP), each time<br>
with 60 mg of CA. The sucked in tobacco smoke was consecutively led<br>
through a flat filter (Whatman QM-A 37 mm) and a XAD-2 adsorption<br>
pattern after passing through said three filter system;;.<br>
In this way a separation could be made in the Tobacco smoke between<br>
PAHs in the solid {particle-bound) phase and the PAH? in the gaseous<br>
phase (Chuang el a!., 1990).<br>
Flat filter and XAD-2 pattern were extracted with methanol and<br><br>
dichloromethane, respectively. After evaporation under nitrogen the extract<br>
was dissolved in 1 ml of acetonitrile. Analysis of this mixture on PAHs was<br>
carried out by means of HPLC. Use was made here of a standard mixture<br>
having 16 PAHs according to the directive of the Environmental Protection<br>
Agency (EPA) for calibration.<br>
Determination of nicotine<br>
After passing the cigarette filter nicotine was measured in tobacco smoke<br>
of filter cigarettes that were smoked discontinuously in 6 minutes accor-<br>
ding to the 60/2/35 FTC directive.<br>
Three filter systems were examined: standard filter of 120 mg of cellulose<br>
acetate (CA control), 15 and 30 mg of network polymer (NP), each time<br>
with 60 mg of CA.<br>
Nicotine, bound to particles or molecularly present in the gaseous phase,<br>
was concentrated on a flat filter (Whatman QM-A 37 mm) and a XAD-4<br>
adsorption pattern, respectively. In this way a separation could be made in<br>
the tobacco smoke between nicotine bound to particles and nicotine<br>
molecularly present: in the gaseous phase (Chuang et al., 1990). For the<br>
analysis of nicotine by means of the gas chromatograph both the flat filter<br>
and the XAD-4 adsorption pattern were ultrasonically (35 kHz, 1 5 minutes)<br>
extracted with ethylacetate.<br>
The pH of cigarette smoke was determined by using the continuous<br>
smoking arrangement described above equipped with a gas washbottle, but<br>
without flow meter, manometer and absolute filter. After absorption of the<br>
cigarette smoke of three cigarettes in a gas washbottle of 250 ml filled<br>
with 100 m! of demiwater, tr.e pH was directly measured in the liquid. Said<br>
pH is defined as pH of cigarete smoke.<br><br>
Determination of toxicity of cigarette smoke<br>
The general toxicity of the smoke of fillet cigarettes after passing the<br>
mouthpiece was determined by smoking them discontinuously in 6 minutes<br>
according to 60/2/35 FTC directive and collecting the smoke. Said general<br>
toxicity was determined for three filter systems: standard filter of 120 mg<br>
of cellulose acetate (CA control), 15 and 30 mg of network polymer (NP),<br>
each time with 60 mg of CA.<br>
In the determination of the general toxicity use was made of a glass<br>
container with 200 mg of NP, in which the smoke components were<br>
collected after passing the cigarette filter. The content of this filter (200<br>
mg of NP) was extracted with acetone of HPLC quality as described under<br>
'determination of tar'. Said extracts were filtrated over a glasswool filter,<br>
evaporated under nitrogen to 2 ml and subsequently stored in screw cap<br>
bottles at 4°C.<br>
As measure for the general toxicity, the inhibition of the energy metabolism<br>
in cells was determined. This took place with reactivated standard cultures<br>
of Vibrio fischeri; a bacterium which luminesces in a well-functioning citric<br>
acid cycle. The method was carried out in a 96-wel' plate according to a<br>
renovated method (Hamers et al.. 2000).<br>
Determination of toxicity of incineration gases of filter material<br>
The toxicity of tested filter systems themselves (not exposed to tobacco<br>
smoke) was examined in an orientating experiment with complete inciner-<br>
ation of filter material, including paper casing.<br>
The standard filte" of 120 mg of cellulose acetate (CA contrcl) was com-<br>
pared to 30 mg of network polymer fin "his case not in combination with<br>
60 mg of CA). Use was made hero of the butyl rubber mouthpiece<br>
described under 'continuous smoking' and a water jet pump adjusted at 20<br>
liters of air per minute.<br><br>
After having been incinerated manually with 5. lighter, the incineration<br>
gases of both filter materials; were absorbed in a 250 ml gas washbottle<br>
filled with HPLC quality acetone or demineralised water (in both cases 50<br>
ml). Both absorption liquids were filtrated over glasswool and stored in<br>
screw cap bottles at 4°C. Serving as blank in the V. fischeri assay was the<br>
surrounding air heated with a lighter, which air, after passing for 5 minutes<br>
(total of 100 liters of air) was absorbed in both liquids.<br>
DR-CALUX assay<br>
The chemical-activated luciferase expression (CALUX) assay for substances<br>
activating the dioxin receptor (DR) is a new type of in vitro bioassay<br>
with which the PAH and dioxin specific toxicity of a mixture of compounds<br>
can be quickly and sensitively quantified (Murk, 1998). Use is made here<br>
of a liver tumor cell line from the rat in which the gene that encodes for<br>
luciferase originating from fire flies, has been coupled as reporter to the<br>
activate of the dioxin receptor.<br>
The DR-CALUX assay was carried out with smoke originating from filter<br>
cigarettes that were discontinuously incinerated in 6 minutes according to<br>
the 60/2/35 FTC directive.<br>
Three filter systems were examined: standard filler of 120 mg of cellulose<br>
acetate (CA control), 15 and 30 mg of network polymer (NP), each time<br>
with 60 mg of CA. The solid phase of tobacco smoke, after passing the<br>
cigarette filter, was concentrated in a glass container containing 200 mg of<br>
NP. The content of this filter (200 mg of NP) was extended with acetone<br>
of HPLC quality as described under 'determination of tar'.<br>
Said extracts were filtrated over a glasswool filter and subsequently<br>
evaporated under nitrogen to 2 ml and stored in screw cap bottles at 4°C.<br>
Depending on the incubation period mainly the decomposable PAH-like<br><br>
compounds or just the stable dioxin-like compounds were quantified. The<br>
DR-CALUX assay was carried out in a luminometer v\/ith 2,3,7,8-tetrachlor-<br>
odibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) as standard. The CALUX response was converted<br>
into nanomol TEQs (TCDD equivalents) per ml of refined extract.<br>
Results<br>
PU filter<br>
The PU-15 filter worked only 12% better with regard to tar removal than<br>
the CA filter in a discontinuous smoking experiment, as described above<br>
under 'Test methods'. Below the test results for the NP and CA filters are<br>
discussed in detail.<br>
Tar removal<br>
For a series of discontinuous and continuous smoking experiments with a<br>
final absolute filter, a tar balance over the three filter systems is shown in<br>
table 1. The values shown for each filter system are the average of five<br>
series of six smoked cigarettes (standard deviation 
the tar content in milligram per cigarette, measured in three filter systems<br>
CA*, NP-15* and NP-30* after continuous and discontinuous [FTC direc-<br>
tives) smoking.<br><br><br>
CA: filter with 120 mg of cellulose acetate, NP-15: filter with 15 mg of<br>
network polymer plus 60 mg of cellulose acetate, NP-30: filter with 30 mg<br>
of network polymer plus 60 mg of cellulose acetate.<br>
Number on the left-hand side regards tar in 15 or 30 mg of NP, number<br>
on the right-hand side tar in 60 mg of CA.<br>
Table 1 shows that the collecting of tar in the NP filters is better than in<br>
1he CA filter. Continuous smoking increases the total tar content with<br>
respect to the Federal Trade Commission method by a factor of 2.5 to 3.<br>
Under both smoking conditions it holds good that the NP filters with an<br>
increasing NP content work considerably bettel than the standard CA filter.<br>
As a result the exposure of the smoker to tar is lower. The trays with<br>
evaporated CA, NF-15 and NP-30 filtrate obtained with the FTC method,<br>
shown in figure 10, show this qualitatively well. Figure 10 shows a<br><br>
qualitative picture of exposure of the smoker to tar in the four, of evaporated<br>
extract originating from the absolute filter (after passing the mouthpiece).<br>
It regards a series o1 three collection sa nples of six filler cigarettes<br>
smoked according to the FTC method. From left to right: CA control, NP-<br>
15 and NP-30.<br>
The quantity of tar that passes through the filter during smoking according<br>
to the standard FTC directive can also be compared to the quantity of tar<br>
that passes through with the double and quadruple frequency, respectively,<br>
of inhalations according to said directive (see table 2). The average inciner-<br>
ation periods here decrease from 6 to 5.5 and 4.5 minutes, respectively. In<br>
all cases a length of the remaining tobacco column of 3-5 mm above the<br>
filter could be maintained.<br>
The values shown for each filter system are the average of three series of<br>
six smoked cigarettes (standard deviation 
is shown in milligram per cigarette for two filter systems CA* and NP-15<br>
for discontinuous smoking according to the one inhalation per minute FTC<br>
directive, compared to the double and quadruple frequency of said directive.<br><br><br>
CA: filter with 120 mg of cellulose acetate, NP-15: filter with 15 mg of<br>
network polymer plus 60 mg of cellulose acetate.<br>
Number on the left-hand side regards tar in 15 mg of NP, lumber on the<br>
right-hand side tar in 60 mg of CA.<br>
With an increased inhalation frequency (FTCx4) the eifectivity of the<br>
network polymer filter increases by a factor of 5. Moreover, the 21 milligram<br>
of tar per cigarette passed tnrough a CA filter is three quarters higher<br>
than the 12 milligram that is specified on the packaging.<br>
As a result of the occurring pressure changes when increasing the inhalation<br>
frequency to two and lour inhalations per minute, the lar content<br>
in the smoke after the CA filter increases (see table 2).<br>
The NP filter appears to be better residant to the often occuring pressure<br>
changes than the CA filter. The quantity of tar in the smoke after the NP<br>
filter is independent of the inhalation frequency.<br><br>
Pressure drop over the filter<br>
7"o the user it is important to know whether a filter with an improved tar<br>
removal does not involve too high a pressure drop. The pressure drop<br>
measured over the filter for three filter systems in discontinuous smoking<br>
for the three filters CA, NF-15 and NP-30, is 70 mbar, 70 mbar and 90<br>
mbar, respectively. These values are the average of two series of six<br>
smoked cigarettes (standard deviation 
Under continuous smoking conditions the average pressure drops are<br>
considerably lower. For the CA and the NP-15 filter an average of 6 mbar<br>
was found; the pressure drop over the NP-30 filter was 9 mbar<br>
Incineration ash of the particles in the smoke after passing the cigarette<br>
filter<br>
The incineration ash of the organic and inorganic particles present in<br>
tobacco smoke after passing the filter was measured in discontinuous<br>
smoking. F:or the three filter systems CA, NP-1 5 and NP-30 the incineration<br>
ashes after passing the filter are 15, 4 and 1 mg/cigarette, respectively.<br>
The values shown for each filter system are the average of two series of<br>
six smoked cigarettes (standard deviation 
Comparison to the values in table 1 shows tnat the incineration ash<br>
passing the mouthpiece of the CA control is twice as greet as the tar<br>
content (7 mg/cigarette).<br>
In addition to what has already been established for tar reduction, the<br>
efficiency in collecting the incineration ashes (particles) for NP filters is<br>
considerably better than the CA control.<br>
Removal of PAHs<br>
The removal of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from tobacco smoke by<br>
means of the network polymer filter was examined under continuous<br><br>
smoking conditions. The values shown for each filter system are the<br>
average of three cigarettes. Table 3 shows the total of 16 FrPA-PAHs (total-<br>
PAHs) and the sum of 6 carcinogens (c-FAHs) in microgram (μg) per<br>
cigarette, sampled in tobacco smoke under continuous smoking conditions<br>
after passing through CA*, NP-15* and NP-30*.<br><br>
CA: filter with 120 mg of cellulose acetate, NP-15: filter with 15 mg of<br>
network polymer plus 60 mg of cellulose acetate, NP-30: filter with 30 mg<br>
of network polymer plus 60 mg of cellulose acetate.<br>
The total-PAHs have been calculated by the summation of the 16 EPA-<br>
PAHs. Of 6 of these PAHs the carcinogenicity is known among which the<br>
two most carcinogenic PAHs occurring in tobacco smoke, namely ben-<br>
2o(a)pyrene and dibenzo(ah)anthrecene (Hoffmann, 1997). The c-PAHs are<br>
the sum of said 6 PAHs.<br>
Table 3 shows that PAHs in tobacco smoke of the CA fiiter have a<br><br>
substantially (94%) particle-bound character. Such a distribution of non-<br>
volatile PAHs in the particle phase and molecularly present in the gaseous<br>
phase of tobacco smoke corresponds to what is mentioned about that in<br>
the literature (Liang and Pankow, 1996).<br>
Of the total-PAHs in the control two-thirds are fluoranthene and pyrene,<br>
present in the particle pnase with 6.8 and 4.6 μg per cigarette, respectively.<br>
Naphthalene, total of 0.6 μg per cigarette., is the most volatile compound<br>
in the series of measured total-PAHs (see table 3) and is for 80%<br>
molecularly present in the gaseous phase.<br>
Said three polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, as regard both mass<br>
concentration and mutual proportion, are considered characteristic to<br>
tobacco smoke (Baker, 1999).<br>
Benzo(a)pyrene and dibenzo(ah)anthracene are quantitatively the most<br>
important as carcinogenic PAHs in tobacco smoke (Hoffmann, 1997). Both<br>
compounds are dominantiy present in the particle phase of the tobacco<br>
smoke examined, with a total quantity of 0.4 and 1.6 microgram per<br>
cigarette, respectively. When using the NP-3C filter an extensive reduction<br>
(93%) of the content of total-PAHs occurs.<br>
For the NP-1 5 filter the reduction of total-PAHs is 65%.<br>
Said results correspond well to the values for tar removal, lound under<br>
continuous smoking conditions (see table 1).<br>
The tar reduction fo- the NP-30 and NP-1 5 filters are 95 and 86%, respectively.<br>
Based on weight, the quantity of PAHs is in the microgram range, as such,<br>
it is approximately 0.1% of the tar mass formed (in milligram) per cigarette.<br><br>
Comparison one to the other of the values shown in table. 3 makes it dear<br>
that for the tested filter systems the concentration of volatile total-PAHs in<br>
the gaseous phase (after passing the filter) remains the same. Adsorption<br>
of volatile PAHs from the gaseous phase of tobacco smoke to the surface<br>
of the network polymer does not occur or hardly so.<br>
Removal of nicotine<br>
The adsorption of nicotine to network polymer was examined in a discontinuous<br>
smoking experiment. Table 4 shows nicotine measurements that<br>
have been made to NP-15 ar:d NP-30 filters. The values shown for each<br>
filter system are the average of four cigarettes smoked according to the<br>
FTC method. In table 4 nicotine (μg/cigarette), bound to particles in<br>
tobacco smoke and molecularly present after passing through three<br>
different filter systems (CA", NP-15" and NP-30*;, respectively, is shown.<br><br>
CA: filter with 120 mg of cel'ulose acetate, NP-15: filter with 15 mg of<br>
network polymer plus 60 mg of cellulose acetate, NP-30: filter with 30 mg<br>
of network polymer plus 60 mg of cellulose acetate.<br>
Because of the good separation of particles, network polymer unintendedly<br>
also functions effectively as filter material for nicotine in tobacco smoke.<br>
The nicotine concentrations in the particle phase of the tobacco smoke<br>
shown in table 4 strongly drop in case of increasing NP filter mass. The<br><br>
quantity of molecularly present nicotine may be: low but is constant. The<br>
adsorption of molecularly present nicotine to the surface of the network<br>
polymer, analogous to the PAHs, does not play a part or hardly so.<br>
General toxicity of cigarette smoke after passing the filter<br>
Tar in cigarette smoke is a complex matrix of compounds of which the<br>
acute effects to the health of the individual smoker are not easy to determine.<br>
To obtain an indication of the general toxicity of tar originating from<br>
smoking experiments via a quick method,, the V. fischeri assay was used.<br>
To that end the inhibition of the light output of tobacco smoke passing a<br>
filter with network polymer and cellulose acetate, respectively, was<br>
expressed with regard to the light output when exposed to a blank of air<br>
(see table 5). The values shown for each filter system are the average of<br>
two series of six smoked cigarettes. Table 5 shows the general toxicity,<br>
determined with the V. fischeri assay and the DR-CALUX assay for three<br>
filter systems (CA", NP-15" and NP-30*) in discontinuous smoking.<br><br>
CA: filter with 120 mg of cellulose acetate, NP-15: filter with 15 mg of<br>
network polymer plus 60 mg of cellulose acetate, NP-30: filter with 30 mg<br>
of network polymer plus 60 mg of cellulose acelate.<br>
Genera! toxicity as perceniage activity inhibition in bioassay clank.<br>
The general toxicity in tebie a strongly decreases as the mass of NP in the<br><br>
NP filter increases. Said data, due to the experimental arrangement chosen,<br>
only regard the solid particles in tobacco smoke that were collected after<br>
passing the filter.<br>
The contribution of compounds in the gaseous phase is not considered<br>
here, but it is very likely negligible. In table 5 the CALUX-TEQ values of the<br>
incineration gases that have passed the various filters, are also shown. In<br>
the DR-CALUX assay the conditions are adapted to the primary measure-<br>
ment of the effects of PAHs and not of dioxin-like compounds. It can be<br>
seen here that the quantity of PAH-specific toxicity dramatically drops<br>
when the quantity of NP in the filter material increases.<br>
The contribution of network polymer itself to the general and specific<br>
toxicity appears to be negligible in these experiments. Extraction of the<br>
unloaded NP-30 filter (without 60 mg of CA) results in a value of 0.6 nmol<br>
TEQ per ml of extract; a multiple lower than the blank of the entire pro-<br>
cedure without smoking in table 5.<br>
General toxicity of incineration gases of filter material itself<br>
The progressing incineration zone in the cigarette will at a certain moment<br>
be able to let the temperature rise to a value critical to decomposition of<br>
the filter. To obtain a qualitative impression of this, the gases formed in the<br>
incineration of the filters were absorbed in demineralised water or in<br>
acetone.<br>
Blank is the absorption liquid after passing ambieni air. The values shown<br>
in table 6 for each filter system are the average of two series of six<br>
incinerated filters. In this test the general toxicity of 120 mg of cellulose<br>
acetate from a standard filter was compared to 30 mg of network polymer,<br>
in this case without 60 mg of CA.<br>
The incineration process of both materials was without flash point. con<br><br>
trary to the KIP filter the CA filter did not extinguish spontaneously. !n table<br>
6 the toxicity is shown of manually incinerated cigarette filters (CA control<br>
and NP-30) that were not exposed to tobacco smoke.<br><br>
. General toxicity as percentage inhibition in bioassay blank (V. fischeri in<br>
2% NaCI).<br>
.. CALUX-TEQ percentage of CA control has been set at 100%.<br>
The use of the absorption media acetone and demiwater shows no difference<br>
with regard to the incineration gases formed out of the filter<br>
materials. From the data in table 6 it appears that 30 mg of network<br>
polymer is not more harmful than 120 mg of cellulose acetate used in the<br>
CA control. In the DR-CALUX assay the incinerated CA control filter in<br>
both series showed 10 times more signal than the incinerated NP filter.<br>
This means that the NP filter during incineration results in less PAH specific<br>
toxicity. This holds also for ooth NP-15 and NP-30 filters, each containing<br>
60 mg CA in addition to 15 and 30 mg NP, respectively.<br>
