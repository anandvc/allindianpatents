				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a method and an apparatus for data transmission with interleaving and subsequent rate matching owing to puncturing or repetition.<br>
Digital communications systems are designed for transmitting data by representing the data in a form which makes it easier to transmit the data via a communication medium. For example, in the case of radio transmissions, the data is transmitted between transmitters and receivers in the communications system in the form of radio signals. In the case of broadband telecommunications networks, the data can be in the form of light, and can be transmitted, for example, via a fiber-optical network between transmitters and receivers in the system.<br>
During data transmission, bits or symbols in the transmitted data may be corrupted, which means that •these bits or symbols cannot be determined correctly in the receiver. For this reason, the data communications systems frequently contain means for ameliorating the corruption of the data which occurs during transmission. One of these means is to equip transmitters in the system with coders, which use an error control cede to code the data before transmission. The error control code is designed such that it adds redundancy to the data, in a controlled manner. In the receiver, errors which occur during transmission can be corrected by decoding the error control code, as a result of which the original data is reproduced. The decoding is carried out using an error<br>
decoding algorithm,  which  corresponds  to the  error control code, which is known to the receiver.<br>
Once the data has been decoded, it is often necessary, for data rate matching, to puncture or to repeat data bits or symbols from a block of coded data, before such data is transmitted. In this context, the term puncturing means a process of removing or deleting bits from a coded data block, with the effect that the punctured bit is not transmitted with this data block. Puncturing could be required, for example, because a multiple access method which is used for transmitting the data via the data-carrying media requires formatting of the data to form blocks of predetermined, size, which size does not correspond to the size of the coded data frame.<br>
In order to accommodate the coded data frame in a transport data block having a predetermined size, data bits are therefore either punctured from the coded data frame in order to reduce the size of the coded data block in a situation in which the coded data frame is larger than the size of the transport data block, or bits in the coded data frame are repeated, in a situation in which the coded data frame is smaller than the predetermined size of the transport data block.^ This will be explained in more detail in the following text using a mobile radio communications system by way of example:.<br>
Mobile radio communications systems are equipped with multiple access systems which operate,_ for example, on the basis of time division multiple access (TDMA) as is used, for example, in the global mobile radio system (GSM) , a mobile radio communications standard which is standardized by the European Telecommunications Standard Institution. As an alternative, the mobile radio communications system could be equipped v.-ith a multiple access system operating using code division multiple access (CDMA) , such as the UMTS system<br>
proposed   for   the   third-generation   universal   mobile<br>
telecommunications system.<br>
However, as can be seen, any desired data communications system could be used to represent an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, such as a local data network or a broadband telecommunications network operating using the asynchronous transmission mode. These examples of data communications systems are characterized in particular in that data is transmitted as frames, packets or blocks. In the case of a mobile radio communications system, the data is transmitted within radio signals which carry data and represent a predetermined amount of data. Figure 7 shows one example of such a mobile radio communications system.<br>
Figure 7 shows three base stations BS which exchange radio signals with mobile stations MS in a radio coverage area which is formed by cells 1, which are defined by dashed lines 2. The base stations BS are coupled to a network relay system NET. The mobile stations MS and the base stations BS exchange data by using radio signals, in that they transmit radio signals 4 between antennas 6, which are coupled to the mobile stations MS and to the base stations BS. The data is transmitted between the mobile stations MS and the base, stations, BS using a data communications apparatu-s, in which the data is transformed into radio signals 4, which are transmitted to the receiving antenna 6, which identifies the radio signals. The data is reproduced from the radio signals by the receiver. The invention can in this jcase be used both in the uplink direction (MS -&gt; BS) and in the downlink . direction (BS -&gt; MS) .<br>
Figure 8 shows an example of a data communications apparatus which forms a radio communication path between one of the mobile stations MS and one of the base stations BS, with , parts which also appear in Picture "7 haviaa identical numerical designations. In<br>
Figure 8, a data source 10 produces data frames 8 at a irate which is governed by<br>
the type of data produced by the source. The data frames 8 produced by the source 10 are supplied __to_ a<br>
rate converter 12, which converts the data frames 8 to form transport data blocks 14. The transport data blocks 14 are designed such that they are of essentially the same size, with a predetermined size and an amount of data which can be carried by frames in data-carrying radio signals, via which data is transmitted by a radio interface which is formed from a pair comprising a transmitter 18 and a receiver 22.<br>
The transport data block 14 is supplied to a radio access processor 16, which controls the sequence of transmission of the transport data block 14 via the radio access interface. The transport data block 14 is supplied at an appropriate time by the radio access processor 16 to a transmitter 18, which converts the transport data block to the frame of data-carrying radio signals, which are transmitted in a time interval which is allocated to that transmitter, in order to transmit the radio signals. In the receiver 22, a receiver antenna 6' ' identifies the radio signals and carries out downward conversion and reproduction of the data frame, and this is supplied to a radio access sequence control reversing apparatus 24. The radio access sequence control reversing apparatus 24 supplies the received data transport block to a frame conversion reversing apparatus 26 which is controlled by the multiple access sequence control reversing apparatus 24, and is supplied via a conductor 28. The rate conversion reversing apparatus 26 then supplies a representation of the reproduced data frame 8 to a destination or sink for the data frame 8, which is represented bv the block 30.<br>
The rate converter 12 and the rate conversion reversing apparatus 26 are designed such that, as far as possible, they utilize the data-carrying capacity<br>
available in the transport data block 14 optimally. According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, this is done by means of the rate matching converter 12, which is used to code the data frame and then puncture or repeat data bits or symbols which are selected from the coded data frame, with the effect of producing a transport data block which fits into the data blocks 14. The rate converter 12 has a coder and a puncturer. The data frame 8 which is supplied to the coder is coded, in order to produce a coded data frame which is supplied to the puncturer. The coded data frame is then punctured by the puncturer, in order to produce the transport data block 14. Depending on the embodiment variant, puncturing of frames can be used both in the uplink direction and in the downlink direction.<br>
GB 2296165 A  discloses  multiplex communications<br>
system, which has puncturing and interleaving.<br>
Those skilled in the art are familiar with the fact that one effect of puncturing a coded data frame is that the probability of correct reproduction of the original data is reduced. Furthermore, the performance of known error control codes and the known decoders of these error control codes is best when the errors which occur during the transmission of the data are caused by Gaussian noise, since this has the effect that the errors are distributed independently throughout the transport data block. When a coded data frame is intended to be punctured, the positions in the coded - data frame at which bits are punctured should be separated as far as possible from one another. To this extent, trie puncturing positions should be distributed uniformly throughout the data frames. Since errors during transmission frequently occur in bursts, particular!; ' in the case of radio communications<br>
systems which do not use interleaving, and since the<br>
repetitions of bits<br>
are not intended to particularly improve the quality just in a certain region of the data frame but should be as uniform as possible, positions in a coded or uncoded data frame in - which data bits are intended to be repeated should be arranged similarly so that they are uniformly separated from one another throughout the entire data frame.<br>
Known methods for selecting positions of bits or symbols which are intended to be punctured in a coded data frame include the division of the number of bits or symbols in a frame by the number of bits or symbols which are intended to be punctured, and the selection of positions with integer values corresponding to the division. In a situation in which the number of bits to be punctured is not an integer division of the number of bits in the data frame, this does not, however, lead to uniform spacings between the punctured positions, thus resulting in the disadvantage that the distance between certain punctured positions is less than this corresponding integer and, in- some cases, the punctured positions are even located alongside one another.<br>
In order to describe the complex invention, the narrower technical field of the invention and the problems that occur in this case will be briefly explained in the following text with reference to Figures 1 to 6 and 9 but, at least partially, also result from the state of standardization for the 3rd mobile radio generation (UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System)) prior to the invention, which is specified in particular in the following document: SI.12 v0.0.l, 3GP? FDD, Multiplexing, channel coding and interleaving description.<br>
The interleaving within a transport multiplexing method is frequently carried out in two steps. The various<br>
I<br>
solutions for carrying out' the puncturing/repetition have various consequences if the puncturing is carried<br>
out after the first interleaver, as is envisaged from the UMTS<br>
system.A second interleaver is now also used in the UMTS system, and is arranged after the physical channej. segmentation and before the physical channel mapping (see Figure 1) . Although this interleaver re_sults in an improvement in the transmitted bits being distributed as uniformly as possible, it has no influence, however, on the distribution of the punctured/repeated bits, and will therefore not be discussed any further for the purposes of this invention.<br>
Figure I shows the use of an FS-MIL (FS-Multistage Interleaver) as an interleaver in the uplink path<br>
multiplexing	method conjunction with a known rate<br>
matching algorithm proposed for UMTS.,<br>
As an example, let us consider a situation in which layer 2 results in a transport block with 160 bits on a transport channel with a transmission interval of 80 ms. This bit sequence can also be described as a data frame, or as a sequence of data frames. This means that, after the first interleaver, , (first interleaving), the data is interleaved over eight radio frames (often also referred to as "frames" or "columns" in the following text) (see Figure 2) . In this case, the interleaving comprises the bits being read line-byline, and the bits being read . column-by-column with<br>
subsequent	column	randomizing    (columns   being<br>
interchanged).<br>
A first aim of a good puncturing algorithm is to distribute punctured bits as uniformly as possible over the bit positions in their original sequence. This was also the critical principle which was used for the definition of the puncturing algorithm for UMTS, as is described, for example, in the abovementioned Specification SI.12. This is best done by puncturing<br>
every n-th bit or, in some cases, every (n+first) bit<br>
if the puncturing rates are not integral.<br>
A second aim is to puncture the various framesf (in the following text, frames are also often referred to as columns  or  radio  frames)  with equal  frequency,  and hence also to distribute the punctured bits uniformly over  all  the  frames,  and  also  to  achieve  uniform puncturing  in  the  various  frames.  The  expressions puncturing or repetition of a column (for the frame) also mean the puncturing or repetition of an element, in particular of a bit in the column (the frame).<br>
Let us now assume that four bits are intended to be punctured in each frame (radio frame) in order to produce a balance 'for the requirements for the quality of the service of this transport channel together with other channels. The result of the rate matching algorithm - previously intended for the UMTS system -is to puncture the bits 4, 9, 14 and 19 (index starts at 0, counting based on the sequence of the bits after the first interleaving) in each frame (radio frame). In Figure 2, a punctured bit is illustrated in bold text. In consequence, eight adjacent bits are punctured, and this, as explained above, is undesirable. The first aim mentioned above is not achieved to a satisfactory extent.<br>
One procedure to avoid this, problem would be to shift the puncturing pattern in each . frame. Let • us assume that Ni is the number of bits in a frame before rate matching, Nc is the number of bits after rate matching, mi is the index of the punctured/repeated bit, k is the frame number and K is the number of interleaved frames.<br>
Let us then consider the situation where Ni&gt;Nc, that is to say puncturing. In the above example, Ni=20, Nc=16, mi = 4, m2=9, m.3=14, m4 = 19, k=1...7 and K=8 . A shift in the positions ofthe bits to be punctured in order to avoid<br>
the abovementioned problem can then be described by the following formula:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
mod NI, where f ] means round up.<br>
The positions of the bits to be punctured resulting<br>
from  this  formula  are  illustrated,  for  the	above<br>
example, in Figure 3.<br>
As can be seen from. Figure 3, the puncturing of adjacent bits is admittedly avoided to a certain extent, but this results in a cyclic effect or edge effect, that is to say for example, bits 43 and 44 are pu-nc'tured, which, as explained above - is undesirable. The "first aim mentioned above is accordingly once again not achieved to a satisfactory extent.<br>
If the puncturing ratio is low, the probability of puncturing adjacent bits decreases. Figure 4 shows an example with 10% puncturing. As can be seen from Figure 4, some adjacent bits (bit 91 and bit 92) are still punctured, however, which results in a reduction in. performance. Once again, the first aim mentioned above is not achieved to a satisfactory extent.<br>
As an alternative to a described rate matching algorithm, it is proposed that the- first interleaver (first interleaving) be optimizedsuch, that the puncturing no longer requires the described rate matching algorithm. An. optimized first interleaver should reorder the bits such .that adjacent bf*ts are<br>
separated. • The puncturin-g	can accordingly be carried<br>
out  simply  by  removing  successive  bits  after  the interleaving  process.  However,   the  following  two options, which will be explained in more detail with ' reference tc the scenario illustrated in Figure 5.<br>
The four blocks on TrCH A are interleaved together, and<br>
the rate matching is then carried out. When puncturing is carried out, successive bits are removed in each frame. It is therefore highly improbable that punctured bits would be adjacent in a frame, with respect to their position before the interleaving process, that is to say after coding. However, there is no guarantee that punctured bits would not be adjacent in different frames after the coding process. In consequence, a reduction in performance could occur when using this approach.<br>
The method explained in the following text with reference to Figure 6 could be used to solve the problem explained with reference to Figure 4, in which method the puncturing pattern applied to a frame is.<br>
also applied, after shifting,, to other frames,	with,.the<br>
shifted patterns being applied to frames before the interleaving process. Figure 6shows a puncturing pattern for the bit sequence example which has already been explained with reference to Figure 3. The illustration shows that no puncturing of adjacent bits occurs, at least in this example. The reduction in. performance resulting from puncturing should therefore be avoided in this case.<br>
In fact, there is no need to carry out, the above rate .matching before the column randomization (column interchanging). Rate matchingequivalentto this can be carried out after the column randomization by taking account of the column randomization rules, and this can easily be achieved just by replacing the initial column-specific offset value eoffset, which describes this shift in the applicationof the puncturing pattern by a s imple formula. The offset value is not calculated on the basis of the column number after column randomization, but the column number before the column randomization, and this can be calculated using the inverse column interchanging rule. Furthermore, e0ffSet can be used not used just for puncturing, but als'o for<br>
repetition. Repetition bits can thus also be positioned<br>
more uniformly.<br>
The following text once again .shows, in summary form, that ..the previously proposed solutions, that is to say the proposed puncturing/repetition patterns, are still not__always optimurn_.in all cases.<br>
I.n..._.the_ introduction, it was shown with reference to Figure 2 and by analysis by way of example of a situation in which layer 2 provides a transport block with 160 bits on a transport channel with a .transmission interval of 80 ms, and subject to the precondition that four bits should be punctured in each frame, that eight adjacent bits are punctured, which is. opviously undesirable. The first aim mentioned above is not .achieved to a satisfactory extent.<br>
The proposal as shown in Figures 3 and 4 was to shift the puncturing pattern in each frame. Once again, as shown, this led to puncturing of adjacent bits (bits 43<br>
and 44 as well as bits 91 and_...__92) The	first aim<br>
mentioned above is not achieved to a .satisfactory extent.<br>
The proposal as . shown in Figure 6 provides for the use ojf shifted puncturing patterns after the interleaving process, in which case the column-specific shifts were, determined on thebasisof analyses before, column interchanging. In this case, this does not lead to any adjacent punctured bits in this example.<br>
However, in a method as shown in Figure _G, there are always still situations in which adjacent bits are punctured, depending on the puncturing rate. Figure 9 shows, by way of example, the situation Ni=16, Nc=14,<br>
mi=4, m2=14, k=1...7 and K=8. For the sake of simplicity, Figures 9 and 10 show only the area before interleaving, in which, however, those bit positions which are punctured after interleaving are illustrated<br><br>
by marking them ln bold print. As can be seen, the adjacent bits 31 and 32 and 95-96 are punctured, which<br>
IS Obviously Undesirable. Once again, the first aim mentioned above is not achieved to a satisfactory extent.<br>
If, in contrast, only every n-th bit were to be punctured with respect to the original sequence after the interleaver process, then the second aim cannot always be achieved adequately. Let us assume, for example, ,80-ms interleaving (as in Figure 9) and a puncturing rate of 1:6. Puncturing every sixth bit would result in only the columns 0, 2, 4, 6 being punctured, but not the columns 1, 3, 5, 7, which is,... __o.f pourse undesirable and .is not .consistent with ...the second aim. In contrast, the first aim would be achieved to a satisfactory extent,.<br>
Against this background, the invention is based on the object of reducing these disadvantages of the prior art.<br>
This object is achieved by the features of the independent claims. Developments of the invention can be found in the dependent claims.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention will now be described just by way of example with reference to the attached drawings, in which:<br>

Figure 13.shews  puncturing  patterns  for  puncturing with a puncturing ratio of 1 : 8 ;<br>
Figure 14   Shows   puncturing   patterns    for  puncturing<br>
with an odd number of bits to be punctured per frame. As explained above, the second aim<br>
always be achieved adequately if every n-th bit were simply to be punctured after interleaving with respect to the original sequence before interleaving. However, the first .aim would be achieved to an adequate extent.<br>
In order to achieve both the abovementioned aims to a satisfactory extent, one embodiment variant of the invention now provides - in contrast to t the uniform puncturing with respect to the original sequence before interleaving - that the puncturing interval be varied at least once, and if necessary a number of times, ' in order to avoid some columns being preferred for puncturing, while others, on the other hand, are not punctured at all. This is shown in Figure 10. Horizontal arrows (P6) with thin surrounding lines show a puncturing distance of 6, and the horizontal arrow (P5) with thick surrounding lines shows a puncturing' distance of 5, in order to avoid puncturing the first column twice. Once each column has been punctured once, the pattern (as shown by the vertical -arrows) can be shifted six lines downward, in order to define the next bits to be punctured. This obviously corresponds to puncturing of every sixth bit in each column, that is to say it corresponds to the use of a standard rate matching algorithm, and to the shifting of puncturing patterns with respect to one another in different columns .<br>
-This method will now be described using formulae in the following text :<br>
Let us assume that Nx is the number of bits in a frame before rate matching, Nc is the number of bits afzer rate matching, m-j is the index of the punctured •• repeated bits, k the Column or frame number after interleaving<br>
and K the number of interleaved columns or frames.<br>
aim is to consider mainly the situation Nwc,   that is<br>
to say puncturing, but the formulae are also applicable<br>
to repetition.<br>
In the above example, Ni=20, Nc=16, mi=4, m2=9, m3=14, m4=19,  k=1...7, with k denoting the column or frame number  after  interleaving,  and  K=8.  A  comment  is indicated by a prefix "--".. The shifts V(k) = S(k) + T(k)  * Q in the application of the puncturing or repetition  pattern  to  the  frame _k  can  then  be determined using the following method: — Calculation of the mean puncturing distance <br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 — where L J means round down and I | means absolute value. Q:= (LNc/(iNi-Nc|)J) div K if q even -- deal with as a special case:<br>
then q = q - lcd{q, K)/K — where lcd(q, K) means the highest common denominator of q and K<br>
—	It should be remembered that led can easily be<br>
calculated by bit manipulation,  since K is a power<br>
of 2.<br>
—	For the same reason, calculations with q can<br>
easily  be  carried  out  using  binary  fixed-point<br>
arithmetic (or integer arithmetic and a small number of<br>
shift operations).<br>
endif<br>
-- Calculation of S and T; S represents the shift in<br>
the line mod K, and T represents the shift magnitude<br>
div K;<br>
S thus represents the shift in the line with respect to<br>
q (that is to say mod K) and T the magnitude of the<br>
shift with respect to Q (that is to say div K);<br>
for i = 0 to K-l<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 where f 1 means round up.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
reverses the interleaver, end for<br>
In  an actual  implementation,  these  formulae  can be implemented  as  shown in  Figure  11,  as  a  reference<br>
table. The table also includes the already described effect of the remapping of the column randomization<br>
achieved by Rs(k) . S can obviously also be calculated<br>
from T, as a further implementation option.<br>
e0ffset can then be calculated as follows:<br>
e0ffset (k) = ((2*5) + 2*T Q +1)* y + 1) mod 2Nc<br>
Using e0ffSet  W /  e is then preloaded in the rate<br>
matching  method  for  UMTS.  This  choice  of  eoffset<br>
obviously results in a shift in the puncturing patterns<br>
in the columns relative to one another by the amount<br>
S +' T * Q.<br>
The following text describes a simplified representation which simply results from the calculation of q and Q not being carried out separately for the remainder in the division by K and the multiple of K, but being combined for both components. In the same way, S and T cannot be calculated separately for q and Q, but likewise combined. The substitutions q+K*Q —&gt; q and S+Q*T —&gt; S result in the following equivalent representation of the method specified above, with the shift at V(k) in this case being given by: V (k) = S (k) . Depending on the details of the implementation, it may be better to carry out one calculation method or the other calculation method or (further methods which are likewise equivalent to them).<br>

where L J means round down and I I<br>
means absolute value.<br>
if q even -- deal with as a special case:<br>
then q = q - lcd(q, K)/K -- where lcd(q, K) means the highest common denominator of q and K<br>
-- It should be noted that led can easily be calculated by bit manipulation, since K is a power of 2.<br><br>
-- For the same reason, calculations with q can easily<br>
be carried out using binary fixed-point arithmetic (or<br>
integer  arithmetic  and  a  small  number  of  shift<br>
operations).<br>

-- Rk(k) reverses the interleaver end for<br>
offset can then be calculated as follows:<br>

mod 2Nc<br>
Using e0ffset (k) , e is then initialized in advance in<br>
the rate matching method.<br>
If the puncturing rate is an odd-numbered fraction, that is to say 1:5 or 1:9, this method likewise produces a puncturing pattern which, is optimum with regard to the two aims mentioned above and which would be used directly before the interleaving by the puncturing using the rate matching method. In other situations, adjacent bits are never punctured, but the distance between adjacent punctured bits may be greater than the others by up to lcd(q,K)+l. This method can also be applied in a corresponding manner to bit repetitions. Although the repetition of adjacent bits does not have such a severe influence on the performance of the error correction codes as is the case when puncturing adjacent bits", it is nevertheless advantageous to distribute repeated bits as uniformly as possible.<br>
The fundamental objective of this method is to achieve a uniform distance between the punctured bits in the original sequence, but taking account of the constraint that the same number of bits must be punctured in the various frames. This is achieved be reducing the puncturing distance by 1 in certain cases. The described method is optimum to the extent that the distance is never reduced by more than 1, and it is reduced only as often as is<br>
necessary. This results in the best-possible puncturing pattern subject to the constraints mentioned above.<br>
The following example uses Figure 12 to show puncturing with., a puncturing ratio of 1:5. The optimized algorithm obviously not only avoids the puncturing of adjacent bits..but punctured bits are also distributed with the same spacing in the original sequence. In fact, the same characteristics are achieved as if the puncturing were to be carried out directly after the coding and<br>
before the	interleaving. In the specific case of 1:5<br>
puncturing and,  to put this in more general terms,<br>
whenever  the	puncturing  rate can be  written  as  a<br>
fraction lug, where g is an integer and q and K, the number of frames, do not have a common denominator, _ it. can be said that an optimum puncturing pattern is produced despite the useof puncturing after the first interleaver. This puncturing pattern results in the puncturing. of__ every__qth bit, in the same_way as an optimum puncturing jgattern which had been carried _ou_t immediately after _thecoding and before the interleaving.<br>
Puncturing with a puncturing ratio of 1:8 will now__be analyzed with reference to Figure 13. Once again, the puncturing of adjacent bits is avoided. In this case, it is impossible to achieve uniformly spaced puncturing, since all the bits in an individual frame would ther. be punctured, which is completely unacceptable with respect to the second aim. In this case, most of the distances between adjacent bits are 7 (only one less than with an optimum distribution) . In this case, some distances are greater (every eighth;.<br>
If the number N1. of input bits can_be divided by K, the rate matching may vary during the transmission time interval. the last frames then have one bit less than<br>
the first,  and therefore also have a somewhat lower<br>
puncturing rate. For this situation, one embodiment-	<br>
variant of the invention provides fo± the puncturing patterns in the last lines not to be changed_.__, Instead o_f this, the same puncturing algorithm is used as for the first columns, but without carrying, out the last puncturing operation. It can be seen from Figure 14 as an example that 125 input bits are intended to be punctured in such a manner that 104 output bits remain, which are interleaved over eight frames. The last two columns- have r_ one,, _input bit less than the first; all the<br>
Columns  have  13  bits,  since  the  last  puncturing operation in the last two columns is omitted.<br>
With regard to the aimsmentioned above/ the method proposed here allows optimized puncturing patterns to be specified when the rate matching is carried out after the first interleaving. The method is simple, requires little computation power and need be carried out only once per frame, and not once per bit. The method is not restricted to radio transmission systems.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1.   Data rate matching apparatus for bits which are to be transmitted and are distributed by a first interleaver over a set of K frames,<br>
having a rate converter which is designed such that a puncturing or repetition method is carried out after the interleaving process such that<br>
in order to puncture or repeat the same number of bits in each frame, the distance between punctured or repeated bits is varied with respect to the sequence of the bits before the first interleaver.<br>
2.	Data rate matching apparatus as claimed in claim 1, having a rate                       converter which is<br>
designed such that bits in a first frame are punctured or repeated in accordance with a<br>
predetermined puncturing pattern or repetition pattern, and<br><br>
that the puncturing pattern or repetition shifted and is applied to further frames for selection<br>
of further bits to be punctured or to be repeated, with the shift in the application of the<br>
puncturing pattern or repetition pattern to a further frame corresponding to the shift of the selected bit with respect to the bit selected in a previous frame.<br>
3.	Data rate matching apparatus for data which is to be transmitted and is distributed by a first<br>
interleaver over a set of K frames, in the form of bits,<br>
having a rate converter which is designed to carry out puncturing or repetition method for<br>
data rate matching after the interleaving process, in such a way that<br>
the same number of bits are punctured or repeated in each frame, in that<br>
the puncturing or repetition pattern which is used within one frame is also shifted and is<br>
applied to within further frames in the set of frames,<br>
in that the set of K bits  in the K frames which all correspond to this position (possibly<br>
shifted) is determined for each position in the puncturing or repetition pattern such that the<br>
distances between these K bits, with respect to the original sequence before the interleaver,<br>
is selected in accordance with a mean integer puncturing distance or repetition distance,<br>
except in the situation where the selection of this distance would lead to one frame being<br>
punctured or repeated twice, and in this situation a distance changed by one is selected.<br>
4.   Data   rate   matching   apparatus,      substantially   as   hereinbefore   described   with   the accompanying drawings.<br></td>
