				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the synthesis of ivabradine of formula (I):<br>
(formula removed)<br>
or 3-{3-[{[(7S)-3,4-dimethoxybicyclo[4.2.0]octa-l,3,5-trien-7-yl]methyl}(methyl)amino]-propyl}-7,8-dimethoxy-l,3,4,5-tetrahydro-2H-3-benzazepin-2-one,<br>
its addition salts with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid and their hydrates.<br>
Ivabradine, and addition salts thereof with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid, and more especially the hydrochloride thereof, have very valuable pharmacological and therapeutic properties, especially bradycardic properties, which render those compounds useful in the treatment or prevention of various clinical conditions of myocardial ischaemia, such as angina pectoris, myocardial infarction and associated rhythm disorders, as well as in various pathologies involving rhythm disorders, especially supraventricular rhythm disorders, and in heart failure.<br>
The preparation and therapeutic use of ivabradine and addition salts thereof with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid, and more especially the hydrochloride thereof, have been described in European patent specification EP 0 534 859.<br>
That patent specification describes the synthesis of the hydrochloride of ivabradine using as starting material the compound of formula (II) :<br>
(formula removed)<br>
which is resolved to yield the compound of formula (III):<br>
(formula removed)<br>
which is reacted with the compound of formula (IV):<br>
(formula removed)<br>
to yield the compound of formula (V):<br>
(formula removed)<br>
the catalytic hydrogenation of which yields ivabradine, which is then converted into its hydrochloride.<br>
The drawback of that synthesising method is that only a 1 % yield of ivabradine is obtained.<br>
Given the pharmaceutical interest in that compound, it is important to be able to obtain it by an effective synthesising process which results in a good yield of ivabradine.<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the synthesis of a compound of formula (VI) in racemic or optically active form :<br>
(formula removed)<br>
wherein A represents H2C-CH2 or HC=CH,<br>
which is characterised in that the compound of formula (VII) in racemic or optically active<br>
form :<br>
(formula removed)<br>
is subjected to a reductive amination reaction with a compound of formula (VIII):<br>
(formula removed)<br><br>
wherein A is as defined hereinbefore,<br>
in the presence of a reducing agent,<br>
in an organic solvent or a mixture of organic solvents.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the compound of formula (VII) is in optically active form, and more especially has the (S) configuration.<br>
When A represents H2C-CH2, the product of the reductive amination of the compound of formula (VII) having the (S) configuration with a compound of formula (VIII) is ivabradine of formula (I):<br>

When A represents HC=CH, the product of the reductive amination of the compound of formula (VII) having the (S) configuration with a compound of formula (VIII) is the compound of formula (V):<br>
(formula removed)<br>
the catalytic hydrogenation of which yields ivabradine of formula (I):<br>
(formula removed)<br>
which may optionally be converted into its addition salts with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid selected from hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, lactic acid, pyruvic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, glutaric acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, maleic acid, citric acid, ascorbic acid, oxalic acid, methanesulphonic acid, benzenesulphonic acid and camphoric acid, and into their hydrates.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the invention, the compound of formula (VII) is in racemic form. The reductive animation reaction of the racemic compound of formula (VII) with a compound of formula (VIII) is in that case followed by an optical resolution step of the compound of formula (VI) obtained.<br>
When A represents H2C-CH2, the product obtained after the optical resolution step of the compound of formula (VI) is ivabradine of formula (I):<br>
(formula removed)<br>
which may optionally be converted into its addition salts with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid selected from hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, lactic acid, pyruvic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, glutaric acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, maleic acid, citric acid, ascorbic acid, oxalic acid, methanesulphonic acid, benzenesulphonic acid and camphoric acid, and into their hydrates.<br>
When A represents HC=CH, the product obtained after the optical resolution step of the compound of formula (VI) is the compound of formula (V) :<br>
(formula removed)<br>
the catalytic hydrogenation of which yields ivabradine of formula (I):<br>
(formula removed)<br>
which may optionally be converted into its addition salts with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid selected from hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, lactic acid, pyruvic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, glutaric acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, maleic acid, citric acid, ascorbic acid, oxalic acid, methanesulphonic acid, benzenesulphonic acid and camphoric acid, and into their hydrates.<br>

cyanoborohydride and dihydrogen in the presence of a catalyst such as palladium, platinum, nickel, ruthenium, rhodium, and derivatives thereof, especially in supported form or in oxide form.<br>
The reducing agent preferably used to carry out the reductive animation reaction of the compound of formula (VII) with a compound of formula (VIII) is sodium triacetoxyborohydride.<br>

1.4 g of the racemic compound obtained in Example 7 are separated on a 60 cm x 60 mm column packed with 3 kg of Chiralpak ® T101 phase (granulometry 20 urn). The eluant used is an ethanol/acetonitrile/diethylamine mixture (10/90/0.1 by volume) at a flow rate of 100 ml/min. The associated ultra-violet detector is used at a wavelength of 280 nm. 0.56 g of the enantiomer having the (R) configuration is obtained in the form of a colourless oil, then 0.62 g of the enantiomer having the (S) configuration is obtained, likewise in the form of a colourless oil.<br>
The compound having the (5) configuration is then hydrogenated by following the procedure described in patent specification EP 0 534 859 (Example 1, Step D). The hydrochloride of the compound obtained is prepared by following the procedure described in patent specification EP 0 534 859 (Example 2, Step E).<br>
