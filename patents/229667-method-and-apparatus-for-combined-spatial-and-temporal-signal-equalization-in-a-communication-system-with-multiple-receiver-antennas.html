METHOD  AND  APPARATUS   FOR  COMBINED  SPATIAL AND  TEMPORAL  SIGNAL  EQUALIZATION  IB A COMMUNICATION   SYSTEM  WITH MULTIPLE  RECEIVER  ANTENNAS<br>
Field<br>
[1001]The present invention relates generally to the field of communications, and more specifically, to communications over a dispersive channel with multiple receiver antennas.<br>
Background<br>
[10021The communication channel between a transmitter and a receiver may be time varying and dispersive. The dispersion of the channel may result in multipath and inter-symbol interference (ISI) and a receiver may need special processing to counteract these and possibly other time varying effects. Such a receiver may include an equalizer for reducing the effect of multipath interference and ISI.<br>
[1003]To this end as well as others, there is a need for an effective equalizer in a communication system.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[1004]A communication receiver performs signal equalization by minimizing a combined local and global mean square error (MSE). A receiver may include a pluralily of antennas for receiving a plurality of signals transmitted from a common source. The plurality of signals carry a common stream of data symbols.    A pre-processing block processes the received<br><br>
signals to produce a plurality of processed received signals. In local optimization, the temporal coefficients for the signals from different antenna are optimized based solely on minimfzing the MSE between the transmitted symbol and the local estimate of the transmitted symbol. In Global Optimization, the temporal coefficients and spatial combiner weights for signals from all antennas are optimized jointly to minimize the global MSE. A signal equalizer minimizes a combined local and global MSE over the processed received signals to produce a combined signal. A decoder decodes the combined signal to retrieve the stream of data symbols. A processor is configured for combining a local MSE and a global MSE in accordancs with a weighting factor a to produce the combined local and global MSE. The processor is configured for adjusting the weighting factor a' to achieve a corresponding effect of adaptation speed and error magnitude in minimizing the combined local and global the MSE.<br>

Various CDMA communication techniques have been disciosed and descritied in various standards published by the Telecommunication Industry Association (TIA). Such standards include the TIA/EIA-95 standard, TlA/ElA-l3-2000 standard, lMT-2000 standard, and WCDMA standard, all incorporated by reference herein. In addition, the specification defined as 'TIA/EiA/lS-856 cdma2000 High Rate Packet Data Air interface Specification," incorporated by reference herein, also provides for a system wherein one or more aspects of the invention may be incorporated. A copy of the standards may be obtained by accessing the world wide web at the address: http-.//www.cdq.orq. or by writing to TIA, Standards and Technology Department, 2500 Wilson Boulevard, Arlington, VA 22201, United States of America. The specification generally identified as WCDMA standard, may be obtained by contacting 3GPP Support Office, 650 Route des Lucioles-Sophia Antipolis, Valbonne-France.<br>
[lOlOJThis invention relates generally to a novel and improved method and apparatus for signal equalization in a communication system. One or more exemplary embodiments described herein are set forth in the context of a wireless data communication system.   While use within this context is<br><br>
advantageous, different embodiments of the invention may be incorporated in different environments or configurations. In general, the various systems described herein may be formed using software-controlled processors, integrated circuits, or discrete logic. The data, instructions, commands, information, signals, symbols, and chips that may be referenced throughout the application are advantageously represented by voltages, currents, electromagnetic waves, magnetic fields or particles, optical fields or particles, or a combination thereof. In addition, the blocks shown in each block diagram may represent hardware or method steps.<br>
[1011]F1G. 1 illustrates a general block diagram of a communication system 100 capable of operating in accordance with any of the code division multiple access (CDMA) communication system standards. Generally, communication system 100 includes a base station 101 that provides communication links between a number of mobile stations, such as mobile stations 102-104, and between the mobile stations 102-104 and a wireline network 105. Base station 101 may include a number of components, such as a mobile station controller, a base station controller, and a radio frequency transceiver. For simplicity, such components are not shown. Base station 101 may also be in communication with other base stations (not shown). Base station 101 communicates with each mobile station 102-104 via a fonward link. The fonward link may be maintained by a fonward link signal transmitted from base station 101. The fonward link signals targeted for several mobile stations 102-104 may be summed to form a fonward link signal 106. Each of the mobile stations 102-104 receiving fonward link signal 106 decodes the forward link signal 106 to extract the information ttial is targeted<br><br>
for its user. At the receiving end, the receiver may treat as interference the portion of the received fonward link signal 106 targeted for others.<br>
[1012]fi^obile stations 102-104 communicate with base station 101 via a corresponding reverse link. Each reverse link is maintained by a reverse link signal, such as reverse link signals 107-109 for respectively mobile stations 102-104. Base station 101 may also transmit a predefined series of data bits on a pilot channel via the forward link to all mobile stations to assist eacf) mobile sfatJon in decoding the fonvard link signal 106. Each of the mobile stations 102-104 may transmit a pilot channel to base station 101. The pilot channel transmitted from a mobile station may be used for decoding the information carried by the reverse link signal transmitted from the same mobile station. The use and operation of a pilot channel are well known. A transmitter and a receiver for communicating via the fon/vard and reverse links are included in each mobile station 102-104, and base station 101.<br>
[1013]A block diagram of a receiver 400 is shown in FIG. 2. Receiver<br>
400	may have several antennas 292-1 to 292-K for receiving the transmitted signal waveform. The signals received at antennas 292-1 to 292-K may be processed in corresponding pre-processing blocks 299-1 to 299-K to produce corresponding signals 298-1 to 298-K. The pre-processing blocks 299-1 to 299-K may include several operations not shown, such as RF/IF downconvertors, AGC {automatic gain control) compensation, A/D (analog-to-digital) conversion.   The signals 298-1 to 298-K pass through an equalizer<br>
401	to present a signal 499 for the decoder. The signals received at antennas 292-1 to 292-K originate from a common source and carry the same stream of<br><br>
data symbols y[n}, where "n" represents the temporal index of the symbols in the received data stream.<br>
t1014]tn communications system 100, the stream of data symbols yfn} may be transmitted from any of the mobile stations 102-104 through a communication channel to receiver 400 in base station 101, or from a base station 101 to any of the mobile stations 102-104. Receiver 400 may be incorporated in base station 101 for receiving signals from a mobile station over a dispersive channsJ, or in a mobile station 102-104 for receiving signals from base station 101 over a dispersive channel. Equalizer 401 may include a number of finite impulse response (FIR) filters 470-1 to 470-K. Although several filters 470-1 to 470-K are shown in FIG. 2, the implementation of the filters may be different in various embodiments. In one case, one filter may be used repeatedly to process aii the signals 296-1 to 296-K. In another case, a filter may be dedicated to each signal 298-1 to 298-K from the antennas 292-1 to 292-K. The equalizer for the path from the mth antenna may be a tapped delay line FIR filter with temporal coefficients Cmfn}. Use and operation of FIR filters are well known in the art.<br>
[1015]The output of each of the filters 470-1 to 470-K represents an estimate of a transmitted data symbol in the data stream y[n]. The output of<br><br><br>
where the FIR filter 470-1 has 2M+1 taps given by [Cj^fn] : ^=-M, ..., M\, ' denotes complex conjugation, and {Xt[n,k] :k= -M, .... /W} denotes the tapped delay-line contents at time n. The outputs of filters 470-1 to 470-K are scaled by tt&gt;e multipliers 480-1 to 4ao-K each of which has an associated spatial coefficient Sm/n/. After the scaling operation, the resulting signals are summed in a combiner 490 to fomi a combined signal 499 which represents a<br><br>
{Cj'ln]: k=-M. ..., M} and the spatial coefficients Smln], for each m, can be optimized in accordance with an embodiment. The signal 499 would then carry an estimate of the transmitted data symbols that could be decoded with improved reliability. The temporal coefficients Cmlnj and spatial combiner weights Sr^n], for m=:l,...,K, may be optimized using the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) criterion in several possible ways. One method, called Local Optimization, optimizes the temporal coefficients Cmlr&gt;] for the m-th antenna based solely on minimizing the MSE between the transmitted symbol y{n} and the local estimate of the transmitted symbol  y„[n], i.e., the FIR<br>
output signal 470-m for the m-th antenna branch. The temporal coefficients Cn^n]are selected to minimize the Locay WSH defined as:<br><br><br>
After the temporal coefficients Cm[n} for each antenna branch are determined, the spatial combiner weights S^^n} are chosen to minimize the mean square error (MSE) in the combined output signal &gt;[«].<br>
[1017]Another method, called Global Optimization, optimizes the temporal coefficients Ca,[n} and spatial combiner weights Stn[n] for all antennas jointly, using the combined output signal y[n]. For Global Optimization, the temporal coefficients and combiner weights are selected<br><br>
[1019]These respective optimizations may be carried out using adaptive signal processing algorithms that are well known in the art, e.g., the Least Mean Square (LMS) algorithm and its variants. When such an adaptive algorithm is used for optimizing the temporal coefficients Cm/h/and spatial coefficients Sm[n], the number of samples (i.e. the amount of training time) required for the coefficients to converge to their steady-stale {i.e., MMSE-optimal) values is greater for Global Optimization than for Local Optimization. However, the steady-state MSE is generally lower for Global Optimization. The present embodiment, called Combined Global-Local Optimization, improves on both these approaches to achieve a balance between low steady stgte MSE and fast convergence time.<br><br><br>
When a is set equal to zero, minimizing the Combined MSB amounts to Global Optimization, whereas if a is set equal to zero, minimizing the combined MSE amounts to Local Optimization. In the embodiment, the value for a may be any number between zero and one (0 
t1021]Jn accordance with an embodiment, once a particular value of a has been selected, one can choose step-size parameters Ac and a^ and update the temporal coefficients Cm[n] and spatial coefficients Sn^n} in an iterative  fashion.      For  example,   the temporal   and   spatial  coefficients<br><br>
where k indexes the coefficients in the FIR filter of 470-1, Ac is the step-size parameter for the temporal coefficients and Ci[n+i] denotes the updated<br><br>
temporal coefficients at time n+1.       Next, for a fixed  set of temporal<br><br>
wfiers zls Is tfie step-size parameter for the spatial coefficients and St[n] denotes ttie updated spatial coefficients at time n+1. The temporai coefficients CmfnJ and spatial coefflcienis Sn^nJ for the other antenna branches are updated analogously. The step-size parameters Ac and As can be any values which guarantee convergence of the iterative updates. Methods for selecting step-size parameters meeting these requirements are well known in the art. Furthermore, it follows by methods well known in the art that these nested iterations converge to a solution which achieves the CombinedMSE.<br>
[1022]FiG. 3 shows a flow chart 600 depicting one or more steps necessary to perfomn a combined optimization of the temporal coefficients Cm[n] and spatial coefficients Sm[n]. Various steps of the flow chart 600 may be performed by a control system. At step 601, the temporal coefficients Cm[n] and spatial coefficients Sn4n] are initialized and the initial values of the parameters ct, Ac and As are selected.   At step 602, an estimate yjn] of the<br>
transmitted symbol is generated for the m-th antenna branch using Xm[n}, the data stream received on antenna m, and the temporal coefficients Cm[n]. At step 603, the estimates on each of the antenna branches are combined, using the spatial combiner coefficients Sm[n], to generate a combined estimate y[n} of the data symbol. The combined estimatB may be passed at step 604 to a decoder and may be evaluated in step 605 to determine whether<br><br>
additional updates of the temporal and spatial coefficients is required. Additional updates may not be necessary when the MSE error is at an acceptably small level. At step 606, the counter is incremented for the next data symbol and the process proceeds to step 602. At step 607 and 608, the values of the temporal coefficients Cm[n] and spatial coefficients S^n] are updated in accordance with the parameters a, Ac and As- At step 609 the parameters a, Ac and As may be adjusted, if desired, from the initial values set at step 601. For example, by adjusting a, the compromise between Local Optimization and Giobal Optimization can be controlled. When the value for a approaches zero, the updates are effectively those of Global Optimization rather than Local Optimization. Similarly, when the value for a approaches one, the updates are effectively those of Local Optimization rather than Global Optimization. This allows the possibility of trading off faster convergence for increased magnitude of the tJISE error, and vice-versa. Reducing the values for the step-size parameters Ac and As yields lower steady-state MSE at the expense of slower convoTgence of the iterations. Increasing the values for the step-size parameters Ac and As speeds up the convergence of the iterations but results in increased steady-state MSE. At step 610, the counter is incremented for the next pilot symbol. At step 611, the process deterrnines whether the last data symbol in the training-interval has been processed. If additional processing over the same stream of data is desired, the proceeds to step 602.<br>
