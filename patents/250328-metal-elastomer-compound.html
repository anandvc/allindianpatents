				<td>Field of the Invention <br>
The invention relates to a metal elastomer compound, namely,  a  compound  comprising  fibrous  metal  material mixed with an elastomer in the range of approximately 5 0 phr to 150 phr.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Elastomers by nature are flexible materials which are used in many applications such as belts, hoses, tires, etc. Metals on the other hands have much less flexibility, but have a much higher tensile and shear strength. Although metals have been added to elastomers in a limited amount to improve electrical conductivity, the purpose for which elastomers and metals have been combined, the percentage of added metals, and the benefits have been very limited.<br>
Another example of metals combined elastomers is steel belted tires wherein steel . wires of differing shapes are embedded in an elastomer body to improve properties. In the case of tires, the steel wires are relatively thick inserts that are not incorporated into the elastomer material mix. They are distinct cords which are not incorporated into the elastomer.<br>
On the other hand, a composite material is a combination of two or more materials that has characteristics not shown by either of the materials separately. It has long been recognized that two or more materials may be blended together to form a wide variety of structured morphologies to obtain products that potentially     offer     desirable     combinations     of<br>
characteristics.   For example,  fiberglass  is made from fine  glass  fibers  bonded  in most  cases by polyester resin.   The glass fibers are very strong in tension,  and the resin helps to .define the shape,  bonds well to the fibers,  and prevents the fibers from damaging each other by  rubbing  against  adjacent  fibers.  Currently,  many different  types of fibers  are available.    Of course, fiberglass   is  not  known   for  being  particularly conductive .<br>
Representative of the art is Japanese application no. JP 1995000207596 which discloses a dielectric elastomer composition obtained by blending a fibrous material of a metallic salt of titanic acid compounded with an elastomer.<br>
What is needed is a compound comprising an elastomer combined with metal fibers or powders with a sufficiently high metal content to give the compound sufficient strength, heat transfer capabilities, magnetic properties and conductivity while retaining the flexibility of elastomers. The present invention meets this need.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The primary aspect of the invention is to provide a compound comprising an elastomer combined with metal fibers or powders with a sufficiently high metal content to give the compound sufficient strength, heat transfer capabilities, magnetic properties and conductivity while retaining the flexibility of elastomers.<br>
Other aspects of the invention will be pointed out or made obvious by the following description of the invention and the accompanying drawings.<br>
The invention comprises a metal elastomer compound comprising an elastomer having a molecular weight in the range of approximately 100,000 g/mol up to approximately<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment The invention comprises a composite compound having a mixture of an elastomer and a fibrous metal material . A  relatively  high  metal  content  gives  the  compound certain   desirable   attributes   of  metals   including strength, heat transfer capabilities, magnetic properties and  conductivity   of  metals  while   exhibiting   the flexibility of elastomers.  The form of the metal fibers or powder added to the elastomer can be of any physical shape.  The preferred physical shape consists of discrete fibers  each  having  an  aspect  ratio  (Length: Width)  in excess of approximately  1:1 up to approximately  6000:1. Once mixed the compound is cured by heat and pressure using methods known in the art . The cured compound can be used in a number of products.  The specification is based upon the cured compound and to which the test results apply .<br>
In the preferred embodiment an elastomer is mixed solely with metal fibers. In an alternate embodiment the elastomer can be mixed with a combination of metal fiber and metal powder. In the alternate embodiment the ratio of metal powder to metal fiber by weight can be in the range from approximately zero, i.e, no powder, to approximately one, i.e, substantially the same amount of metal powder and metal fiber by weight . The metal powder<br>
particles   have  an  aspect  ratio  in  the  range  of approximately 1 .<br>
One of the preferred metal materials  used for the fiber  or powder  i.s  stainless  steel  due  to  its  high tensile  strength  and  corrosion  resistance.    Another suitable metal is aluminum alloy due to its low weight, high strength and corrosion resistance.   In addition to stainless  steel and aluminum,  other fiber materials may be used such as glass fibers and carbon fibers as well as other metals described herein.<br>
To manufacture the compound, metal fiber (and metal powder for the alternate embodiment) is mixed with the elastomer components using mixing methods known in the art . The strands of metal fiber or metal powder particles are randomly distributed throughout the elastomer compound during the mixing process with no preferred axial orientation. By interlocking, crossing and spreading throughout the matrix of the cured compound the metal fibers improve the mechanical properties of the compound such as tensile strength, compressive strength, and fatigue strength over that of the elastomer by itself. Furthermore, when used for products for which wear occurs on the surface of the part (such as tires and belts) , after some minimal initial wear of the surface of the compound the exposed metal fibers and metal powders create a very good wear resistance.<br>
In yet another alternate embodiment, the metal fibers can be axially oriented by a calendaring step known in the art so that the major axis of a substantial number of the metal fibers are substantially parallel to a machine direction. This will cause the compound to have a dual flexibility dependent upon the direction of orientation of the fibers. Namely, the compound will be more flexible in a direction transverse to the machine<br>
direction, that is, more flexible along an axis that is normal to the predominant direction of the axis of the parallel fibers.<br>
The metal fiber length and cross sectional dimensions are unlimited so long as the size and shape of the metal fibers don't adversely affect performance of the compound. However, the preferred size range is approximately 5 to 30 mm long and 0.005 to 0.5 mm (5 to 500 micron) in diameter. For purposes of illustration only the fiber cross section is considered round, but the cross section may be of any shape. The percentage of metal fiber in the elastomer can be any amount required but approximately 20% to about 80% percent by volume is the preferred range. Since the metal fibers are only 5 to 30 mm in length with a small cross sectional diameter, they allow the compound' to flex like an elastomer, while also exhibiting metal-like properties where desired. Hence, the inventive compound has the characteristics of both a metal and an elastomer.<br>
Furthermore,  the inventive compound and its method of manufacture can be applied to all types of plastics, including thermoset and thermoplastic materials.   It can be used in any product where it is desirable to achieve increased mechanical  strength,  improved wear resistance, enhanced heat transfer,  as well as improved electrical conductivity over the prior art due to the higher metal fiber content.   The type of metal used,  the size and shape of the fibers,  and the percentage  of the added metal  fiber compared  to the  elastomer  amount  can be adjusted to suit a particular application.

Following are example recipes for the inventive compound. Table 1 lists the compound recipe used in this analysis. "X" denotes the phr value of metal fibers in<br>
the      compound .    Table    2    illustrates     the    compound    mixing procedures<br>

Table 4 shows the compound recipe used to evaluate the initial mixing performance of the inventive compound.<br>
Compound  (A)  is a control  compound without metal  fiber. Mixing was performed according to the procedure  shown in Table 3 .  Four different types of stainless steel fibers were  investigated   (see Table  3)  sold by NV Bekaert  SA with headquarters  located in Belgium.  Beki-Shield GR was coated  by  polyester  resin  for  improving  bonding   (or cooperation)  with polymer  (plastics or rubber)  matrix. Beki-Shield  BU is the same metal fibre as "GR" version, just without coating and in bundle form. Bekipor * WB is a composition  of metal  fibers,  uniformly  laid to form a three-dimensional  non-woven  structure.  Its porous medium is  a  non-woven,   highly  porous  fiber matrix  made  of sintered metal fibers. A stainless  steel fiber having a large diameter from Fibre Technology Ltd was evaluated as well, namely M0446/10.<br>
Other suitable metal  fiber metals may also include any type  of stainless  steel,  any type  of steel,  low carbon,  high  carbon,  and  alloy  steels.    Aluminum  and aluminum alloys,  "red" metals  such as copper,  brass and bronze.  Nickle,  chromium,  zinc, tin, magnesium,  vanadium and titanium.   Inconel and other alloys.  Any other metal and metal alloy fiber that is compatible with the chosen elastomer.   The metal materials used for the metal fibers can be used for the metal powder as well .<br>

Compound (A) was mixed without any problems and dropped to 300F in 4 minutes. Table 5 shows a comparison of physical properties. Compound IB) showed less desirable properties than compound (A) .<br>

All   the  above   observations   indicate   that  the compatibility  between  rubber  and  metal  fiber  is very-poor, which caused poor mixing behavior  and poor compound physical properties. Metal Elastomer Compatibility  Improvement .<br>
In order  to improve  the  compatibility  between  the elastomer  and  the  metal  fibers  zinc  dimethylacrylate (ZDMA)   (Sartomer  Company,  Inc. : Tradename  "Saret  634") was  used.    ZDMA  is a well  known  rubber-metal  bonding agent.  It  was  used  in  this  compound  to  improve  the compatibility  between  the  elastomer  matrix  and  metal fibers.     Other  bonding  agents  may  be  used  in  the inventive  compound  as well,  including  maleic  anhydride grafted  polyolefins,   acrylic  acid  grafted  polyolefins, zinc diacrylate,  cobalt  carboxylate,   zirconate  salt  and titanate  salt.   Table  6 shows the recipes used  for each compound  c , D ,  E in this  example.    Only  compound   (E) contains metal fibers, namely,  BEKI -Shield GR.<br>
Table 6. Addition of bonding agent.<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Polyethylene glycol is used as a processing aid in the compound. Calcium oxide (80% weight content) is a desiccant which used to prevent porosity in the compound due to moisture.<br>
The compounds were mixed following the procedure  in Table  3 .  All three  compounds  mixed very well and came together very well . Figure 1 shows the compound tensile property  at extension break  (elongation around or above 300%) . "RT"  in this and other  figures  stands  for room<br>
temperature, approximately 22Â°C. The use of metal fiber in the compound did not give significant improvement at extension break. However, compound extension modulus at 25%, 50% and 100% elongation (Figure 2) obtained a significant increase by using metal fiber (BEKI-Shield GR) .<br>
Figure 3 shows a comparison based on compound tear strength.  It can be seen that tear strength increased by use  of metal  fiber BEKI-Shield  GR.   However,  compound compression  set was not adversely  affected  as compared with  the  compound  with  bonding  agent,  see  Figure  4 . Elastomer  compression  set is a measurement  of the ratio of  elastic  to  viscous  components  of  an  elastomer's response  to a given deformation.   Longer polymer  chains tend  to give  better  "set  resistance"  because  of  the improved  ability  to  store  energy  (elasticity) .   Most elastomer  compression  set measurement  standards  call for a  25%  original  compression   for  a  given  time  and temperature.    The  cross-section  is measured  after  the load  is  removed.    Elastomer  compression  set  is  the percentage  of  the  original  compression   that  is  not recovered.      Compression   set  may  be  conducted   on cylindrical  disks or O-rings.   After a load is released<br>
from an elastomer, the difference between the final dimensions and the original dimensions is considered the "compression set" .<br>
Figure 5 shows stress -strain curves comparing compressive strength tests. It can be seen that compressive strength was improved by use of BEKI -Shield GR, especially at a high strain level.<br>
The wear property  of each compound  was tested at a friction  speed  of 200  rpm with  a  loading  of 20  Ibs. Figure  6 compares  the weight  loss for the each compound. It can be seen that compound with bonding  agent  (D)  has the highest weight  loss.  The inventive  compound with the combination  of metal  fiber and bonding  agent  (E)  showed the lowest weight loss .<br>
Figure  7 shows  a comparison  of the  coefficient  of friction  (COF) . It can 'be seen that compound  (E) has the lowest  COF value,  which  is consistent  with  the  lowest weight  loss.   Compound  (D)  has  the highest  COF,  which could result in the highest weight  loss for a test period of 2000  second.  Figure  8 shows  test results  for a test duration  of 6 hours.  The same trend was observed  in Fig. 8 as in Fig. i .<br>
Based on the foregoing results the amount of metal fibers (BEKI-Shield GR) was increased to 100 phr in compound (F), see Table 7 .<br>
Table 7. Amount of metal fibers.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Figure  9 shows  a comparison   of extension  modulus.   It can  be  seen  that  the  extension   modulus   at  25%  and  50% elongation    are   increased   with   increasing    metal   fiber loading  level.    However,   the  modulus   at  100%  elongation does   not   change   significantly    with   the  metal   fiber loading   increase.     Generally,    the  higher   the  elastomer molecular    weight,    the   higher    loading    of   fillers, including    metal    fibers,    that   can   be-  put   into   the compound.   In other  words,   the  amount  of metal  fiber  that can  be  loaded   to  the  compound   is  dependent   upon  the elastomer  molecular   weight.    For example,   when  using  EPDM having  a molecular   weight   in the  range  of approximately 100,000   g/mol   to  approximately    300,000  g/mol  the  metal fiber  loading  can  range  from  approximately    50 phr  up to approximately    150  phr  while   maintaining    the  desired physical  properties.<br>
Figure   10  shows   a  comparison    of- compression    test curves  for various   compounds    (C) ,  (D) ,  (E) , and  (F)  from Table  7 . It can  be seen  that  an increase   in metal  fiber (BEKI -Shield  GR)  loading   increases   compressive    strength of the compound,   see curves  for  (E)  and  (F) .<br>
Figure  11 shows  a comparison   of the  coefficient   of friction   of  the  various   compounds    in  Figure   10.    An increase   of metal   fiber  loading   reduces   the  COF  of the compound.     Table   8  shows  the  recipe   for  each  compound (E) ,  (G) ,  (H) ,  (I) .  The  difference   between  each  compound is the use  of different   types  of metal  fibers.    All  are used  in the amount  of 50 phr  (pounds  per hundred  rubber) Table a . Evaluation of different metal fibres.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
It was found that different  forms  of Bekaert  metal fiber do not  significantly  change  the  improved  compound physical properties,  compounds  (E) ,  (G)  and  (H) . However / the larger diameter metal fiber  (MO446/10)  (compound  <n lowers some compound physical properties for example the compressive strength is lower than control without metal fiber see figure></n>
Figure  13  shows  the  change  of weight  loss  with friction  time for compound  (E)  and  (i) . The curve  slope (weight loss per unit time)  for compound  (E)  is lower.<br>
The inventive compound provides higher modulus, higher compressive strength, higher tear strength and better wear property than elastomeric materials not containing metal fibers. Increasing the loading level of metal fiber (up to lOOphr) further improves these physical properties.<br>
Hence,  the inventive  compound  comprises  a number of advantages.   These include improved compressive  strength, tensile  strength,   fatigue  strength,   wear  resistance, electrical  conductivity,   magnetic  properties,   and heat transfer  capabilities.    This  is manifest  in part  by a significantly    longer   wear   life   realized   by   the combination   of  the  attributes   of  metals   with  the flexibility of elastomers.<br>
This  invention  can be used  for applications  where the combination  of strength of metals  and flexibility  of elastomers   are   required.   Belt   driven   continuously variable  transmissions   (CVT)  are one  example.  The main component  of a CVT transmission  is a CVT belt  must be<br>
capable of handling heavy side loads applied across the width of the belt by the variable diameter pulleys. A CVT belt also has to have a very high wear resistance on the belt sides where it contacts the pulleys sheaves. The CVT belt must also transfer heat well enough to prevent thermal decomposition of the elastomer. The prior art for high load CVT belts comprises an elastomer band with metallic clips mounted transversely to the elastomer band. Manufacturing belts with transverse clips is a costly operation and the performance of such a CVT belt is limited. The heat generated by the friction between the transverse clips or belt side wall and pulley sheaves can cause thermal decomposition of the elastomer and ultimately premature failure of the belt . The inventive compound makes an improved CVT belt possible having high compressive strength and high wear resistance on the sides, as well as good heat transfer characteristics.<br>
Another  example  were  the  inventive  compound  is applicable is in vehicle tires.  The high wear resistant compound improves the wear resistance of the tires,  i.e., tread wear  rating,  as well  as adding  other  important mechanical   properties   such   as   improved   tensile, compressive, and fatigue strength.<br>
The inventive compound and products made therefrom can  be  used  in  other  automotive  and  non-automotive applications as well including but not limited to power transmission belts,  hoses,  dampers, vibration isolators, and shock absorbers.  Namely,  the inventive compound can be  used  in  any  elastomeric  or  plastic  application requiring   high   strength,   higher   wear   resistance, electrical   conductivity,   magnetic   properties,    and improved heat transfer properties.<br>
Although forms of the invention have been described herein,  it will be obvious to those skilled in the art<br>
that variations may be made in the process and construction and relation of parts without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention described herein.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
