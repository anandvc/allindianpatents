Technical field<br>
The present invention concerns a dynamic mixture obtained by combining, in the<br>
presence of water, at least one hydrazine derivative with at least one active aldehyde or<br>
ketone. The invention's mixture is capable of releasing in a controlled and prolonged<br>
manner said active compound in the surrounding environment.<br>
The present invention concerns also the use of said dynamic mixtures as<br>
perfuming ingredients as well as the perfuming compositions or perfumed articles<br>
comprising the invention's mixtures. A further object of the present invention is the use of<br>
specific hydrazine derivatives as additives to prolong the perfuming effect of particular<br>
aldehydes or ketones.<br>
Prior art<br>
Active compounds, such as fragrances, but also insect attractants or repellents, as<br>
well as some bactericides, are volatile molecules that can only be perceived over a limited<br>
period of time. For instance, the perfume industry has a particular interest for<br>
compositions or additives which are capable of prolonging or enhancing the perfuming<br>
effect of fragrances over a certain period of time, for example in order to overcome the<br>
problems encountered when using perfuming ingredients as such, which are too volatile<br>
or have a poor substantivity or are only deposited in a small amount onto the surface of<br>
the final application. These compositions or additives can be used in various-applications,<br>
as for example in fine or functional perfumery or in cosmetic preparations. The washing<br>
of textiles is a particular field in which there is a constant quest to enable the effect of<br>
active substances, in particular perfumes, to be effective for a certain period of time after<br>
washing and drying. Indeed, many substances having odors which are particularly suitable<br>
for this type of application are known to lack tenacity on laundry, or do not remain on the<br>
laundry when rinsed, with the result that their perfuming effect is experienced only briefly<br>
and not very intensely. Given the importance of this type of application in the perfume<br>
industry, research in this field has been sustained, in particular with the aim of finding<br>
new, and more effective solutions to the aforementioned problems.<br><br>
A variety of chemical delivery systems which release active material by a chemical<br>
reaction during or after application (using O2, light, enzymes, water (pH) or temperature<br>
as the release trigger) have been described as an alternative to encapsulation systems. In<br>
general, due to their inherent instability, the precursors often decompose in the application<br>
base during storage and thus release their fragrance raw material before the desired use.<br>
To the best of our knowledge, none of the compositions of the present invention<br>
are known from the prior art and no hydrazine derivatives have been described for a use as<br>
disclosed further below.<br>
Dynamic libraries using hydrazines and carbonyl derivatives are known from the<br>
pharmaceutical industry. However, in such prior art libraries, the ketones or aldehydes are<br>
pharmaceutically active compounds, and the libraries themselves are either used to<br>
generate a multitude of more or less biologically active compounds or for rapid<br>
identifications of biological receptors or ligands. None of said prior art documents<br>
suggest, or allow to reasonably expect, that the reversibility of the formation of addition<br>
products between carbonyl compounds and hydrazine derivatives may allow to deliver<br>
said carbonyl compounds in a controlled manner or that such libraries can be used<br>
successfully as perfuming ingredients or even that they allow to prolong the fragrancing<br>
effect of a perfuming compound, especially in a consumer product.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
We have now surprisingly found that a dynamic mixture, obtainable by<br>
combining, in the presence of water, at least one hydrazine derivative with at least one<br>
active aldehyde or ketone is a valuable ingredient capable of releasing, in a controlled and<br>
prolonged manner, said active aldehyde or ketone.<br>
As "dynamic mixture" we mean here a composition comprising a solvent, several<br>
starting components as well as several addition products that are the results of reversible<br>
reactions between the various starting components. Said dynamic mixtures take advantage<br>
from reversible chemical reactions, in particular hydrazone formation and dissociation by<br>
reversible hydrazine/carbonyl condensation. The ratio between the various starting and<br>
addition products depends on the equihbrium constant of each possible reaction between<br>
the starting components. The usefulness of said "dynamic mixture" derives by a<br>
synergistic effect between all the components.<br><br>
As the term "active" we mean here that the aldehyde or ketone to which it is<br>
referred is capable of bringing a benefit or effect into its surrounding environment, and in<br>
particular a perfuming, flavoring, insect repellent or attractant, bactericide and/or<br>
fungicide effect. Therefore, for example, said "active aldehyde or ketone" possesses at<br>
least one property which renders it useful as perfuming or flavoring ingredient, as insect<br>
repellent or attractant or as bactericide or fungicide.<br>
According to all the above and below mentioned embodiments of the invention,<br>
the invention's delivery system is particularly useful when the active aldehyde or ketone is<br>
a perfuming ingredient, i.e. a perfuming aldehyde or ketone. A "perfuming aldehyde or<br>
ketone" is a compound, which is of current use in the perfumery industry, i.e. a compound<br>
which is used as active ingredient in perfuming preparations or compositions in order to<br>
impart a hedonic effect. In other words, such an aldehyde or ketone, to be considered as<br>
being a perfuming one, must be recognized by a person skilled in the art of perfumery as<br>
being able to impart or modify in a positive or pleasant way the odor of a composition,<br>
and not just as having an odor. From now on we will refer to said "perfuming aldehyde or<br>
ketone" also as "perfuming compounds".<br>
In general, the invention is carried out exactly in the same manner, independently<br>
of the exact properties of the active aldehyde or ketone. Therefore, it is understood that,<br>
even if the invention will be further illustrated hereinbelow with a specific reference to<br>
"perfuming compounds", the below embodiments are also applicable to other active<br>
aldehydes or ketones (i.e. it is possible to replace the expression "perfuming' with "insect<br>
attractant" or with "insect repellent and bactericide", for instance).<br>
Now, according to a particular embodiment of the invention, the present invention<br>
concerns a delivery system in the form of a dynamic mixture, obtainable by reacting, in a<br>

wherein the underlined compounds represent, in an embodiment of the invention,<br>
particularly useful fragrance aldehydes or ketones.<br>
Furthermore, some of the above-mentioned compounds may also be used as<br>
perfuming, flavoring, insect repellent or attractant, bactericide or fungicide ingredients.<br>
The invention's delivery system can be obtained by admixing together, in the<br>
presence of water, at least one compound of formula (T) and at least one perfuming<br>
compound. Furthermore, as it is very useful in the perfumery art to have compounded<br>
perfumery ingredients, so as to achieve more pleasant and natural scents, a delivery<br>
system obtained by reacting together at least two hydrazine derivatives with at least one<br><br>
perfuming compound is particularly appreciated. Similarly, it is also particularly<br>
appreciated to obtain a delivery system by reacting together at least one or two hydrazine<br>
derivatives with at least two, or even at least three, perfuming compounds.<br>
As mentioned above, the invention's delivery system comprises several starting<br>
components that may react, in a reversible manner, between them to form addition<br>
products.<br>
It is believed that the main components of the dynamic mixture are the free<br>
aldehyde, ketone, hydrazine derivative and the resulting addition products (such as<br>
hydrazones and the intermediate hermaminal derivatives). A specific example of such a<br>
mixture and equilibrium is presented in Scheme (I):<br>
Scheme (I) : Example of an equilibrium and the species present in a dynamic mixture<br>
composed of one specific aldehyde and one specific hydrazine derivative<br><br>
As a consequence of the fact that the reactions are reversible, a dynamic mixture<br>
can also be obtained by adding one or more hydrazone derivatives into water and let the<br>
mixture attain its equilibrium. However, it has to be pointed out that the time required to<br>
reach the equilibrium point can vary significantly depending on the fact that there is used<br>
the hydrazone or the hydrazine derivative as starting material, as said time is believed to<br>
be dependent on various parameters such as solubilities or the basicity of the medium.<br>
The preparation of the invention's dynamic mixture by the simple admixture of the<br>
perfuming compounds in the presence of water avoids the need of additional chemical<br>
steps such as the preparation of the hydrazones.<br><br>
Therefore, due to its nature, the invention's dynamic mixture circumvents the<br>
problem of product instability observed with prior art precursors, by the fact that a<br>
dynamic equilibrium is spontaneously set up between these compounds. The equilibrium<br>
is stable during product storage as long as the consumer product parameters (such as<br>
concentration, temperature, pH or humidity, the presence of surfactant etc.) are kept<br>
constant. At given set of parameters, the time required to reach the equilibrium state<br>
mainly depends on the kinetic rate constant of the slowest step involved in the formation<br>
of the products of the equihbrium.<br>
As mentioned above, the delivery system of the invention comprises various<br>
components. It is believed that, once the delivery system is deposited on a surface, the free<br>
perfuming aldehydes or ketones start to evaporate, diffusing in the surrounding<br>
environment their typical scent. Said evaporation perturbs the chemical equilibrium and<br>
the various addition products start to decompose so as to restore the equilibrium. The<br>
consequence of such re-equilibration is the regeneration of free perfuming aldehydes or<br>
ketones, thus mamtaining their concentration relatively constant over time and avoiding a<br>
too rapid evaporation.<br>
Now, it has been observed that the various physical or thermodynamic properties<br>
of the delivery system, e.g. its deposition on a surface or the amount of addition products<br>
formed, can be influenced by the chemical nature of the perfuming compounds or of the<br>
hydrazine derivatives. Another way to influence the above-mentioned properties is to<br>
modify the molar ratio between said perfuming compounds and the hydrazine compounds.<br>
For instance, the lower the molar ratio between perfuming compounds and hydrazine<br>
derivatives, the longer takes the evaporation of all the perfuming compounds. The<br>
presence of other ingredients (such as surfactants, emulsifiers, gelators or others) typically<br>
used in the final consumer product formulation may also influence the above-mentioned<br>
properties.<br>
Therefore, by varying the chemical structure of the mixture's constituents and their<br>
ratio, it is possible to fine-tune the release properties of the invention's dynamic mixture,<br>
so as to adapt its behavior to the specific requirement of the targeted consumer product.<br>
According to the final application, a broad range for the speed of evaporation of<br>
the perfuming compound may be desirable.<br><br>
The ratio between the total molar amount of perfuming aldehyde and/or ketone<br>
and the total molar amount of the compound of formula (I) can be comprised between 1:2<br>
and 50:1, preferably between 1:1 and 10:1.<br>
As previously mentioned, the invention's delivery system enables a controlled<br>
release of an active aldehyde or ketone, and in particular a perfuming one. Such a<br>
behavior makes the invention's dynamic mixture particularly suitable as active ingredient.<br>
Consequently, the use of an invention's delivery system as active ingredient is another<br>
object of the present invention. In particular it concerns a method to confer, enhance,<br>
improve or modify the odor properties of a perfuming composition or of a perfumed<br>
article, which method comprises adding to said composition or article an effective amount<br>
of an invention's delivery system.<br>
Moreover, another object of the present invention concerns also a composition<br>
comprising the invention's delivery system. This concerns also in particular a perfuming<br>
composition comprising:<br>
i) as perfuming ingredient, a delivery system as defined above;<br>
ii) at least one ingredient selected from the group consisting of a perfumery carrier and a<br>
perfumery base; and<br>
iii) optionally at least one perfumery adjuvant.<br>
Preferably, in said perfuming composition the perfumery carrier, perfumery base<br>
and perfumery adjuvant have a total molar amount of aldehydes or ketones which is equal<br>
or higher than the molar amount of hydrazine derivatives of the delivery system.<br>
By "perfumery carrier" we mean here a material which is practically neutral from a<br>
perfumery point of view, i.e. that does not significantly alter the organoleptic properties of<br>
perfuming ingredients. Said carrier maybe a liquid. As liquid carrier one may cite, as non-<br>
limiting examples, an emulsifying system, i.e. a solvent and a surfactant system, or a<br>
solvent commonly used in perfumery. A detailed description of the nature and type of<br>
solvents commonly used in perfumery cannot be exhaustive. However, one can cite as<br>
non-limiting examples solvents such as dipropyleneglycol, diethyl phthalate, isopropyl<br>
myristate, benzyl benzoate, 2-(2-ethoxyethoxy)-l-ethanol or ethyl citrate, which are the<br>
ones most commonly used.<br>
Generally speaking, by "perfumery base" we mean here a composition comprising<br>
at least one perfuming co-ingredient.<br><br>
Said perfuming co-ingredient is not an aldehyde or ketone as defined above for the<br>
dynamic mixture. Moreover, by "perfirming co-ingredient" it is meant here a compound,<br>
which is used in perfuming preparation or composition to impart an hedonic effect. In<br>
other words such a co-ingredient, to be considered as being a perfuming one, must be<br>
recognized by a person skilled in the art as being able to impart or modify in a positive or<br>
pleasant way the odor of a composition, and not just as having an odor.<br>
The nature and type of the perfuming co-ingredients present in the base do not<br>
warrant a more detailed description here, which in any case would not be exhaustive, the<br>
skilled person being able to select them on the basis of its general knowledge and<br>
according to intended use or application and the desired organoleptic effect. In general<br>
terms, these perfuming co-ingredients belong to chemical classes as varied as alcohols,<br>
esters, ethers, acetates, nitriles, terpene hydrocarbons, nitrogenous or sulphurous<br>
heterocyclic compounds and essential oils, and said perfuming co-ingrediehts can be of<br>
natural or synthetic origin. A further class of perfuming co-ingredient can be the<br>
aldehydes or ketones which do not react with the hydrazine derivative present in the<br>
dynamic mixture.<br>
Many of these co-ingredients are in any case listed in reference texts such as the<br>
book by S. Arctander, Perfume and Flavor Chemicals, 1969, Montclair, New Jersey,<br>
USA, or its more recent versions, or in other works of a similar nature, as well as in the<br>
abundant patent literature in the field of perfumery. It is also understood that said co-<br>
ingredients may also be compounds known to release in a controlled manner various types<br>
of perfuming compounds.<br>
For the compositions which comprise both a perfumery carrier and a perfumery<br>
base, other suitable perfumery carrier, than those previously specified, can be also ethanol,<br>
water/ethanol mixtures, limonene or other terpenes, isoparaffins such as those known<br>
under the trademark Isopar® (origin: Exxon Chemical) or glycol ethers and glycol ether<br>
esters such as those known under the trademark Dowanol® (origin: Dow Chemical<br>
Company).<br>
Generally speaking, by "perfumery adjuvant" we mean here an ingredient capable<br>
of imparting additional added benefit such as a color, a particular light resistance,<br>
chemical stability and others. A detailed description of the nature and type of adjuvant<br><br>
commonly used in perfuming bases cannot be exhaustive, but it has to be mentioned that<br>
said ingredients are well known to a person skilled in the art.<br>
An invention's composition consisting of an invention's delivery system and at<br>
least one perfumery carrier represents a particular embodiment of the invention as well as<br>
a perfuming composition comprising an invention's delivery system, at least one<br>
perfumery carrier, at least one perfumery base, and optionally at least one perfumery<br>
adjuvant.<br>
As anticipated above, the invention's dynamic mixtures or compositions can be<br>
advantageously used for bringing a benefit to consumer products, such as its perfuming.<br>
Indeed, said mixture possesses several other properties that make it particularly suitable<br>
for this purpose. Consequently, a consumer article comprising the invention's delivery<br>
system is also an object of the present invention.<br>
Indeed, and for example, another advantage of invention's mixture is an improved<br>
deposition on a surface of the perfuming aldehydes or ketones compared to those of the<br>
pure ketones or aldehydes as such.<br>
All the above-mentioned properties, i.e. improved substantivity, prolonged time of<br>
evaporation, improved stability over aggressive agents, and improved deposition, are very<br>
important for a perfuming composition. Indeed, when said compositions are intended for<br>
use in fine perfumery, the invention's mixture may allow the creation of new perfuming<br>
effects which are otherwise difficult to be achieved, such as a fresh green note being<br>
present over several hours, fn the case of perfuming compositions intended for the<br>
functional perfumery, the above-mentioned properties are also very important. For<br>
example, perfuming ingredients present as such in washing compositions which have<br>
generally little staying-power on a surface are consequently often eliminated, for example<br>
in the rinsing water or upon drying of said surface. This problem can be solved by using<br>
the invention's dynamic mixture, which possesses an improved stability over storage and<br>
substantivity on surfaces, such as textiles or hair.<br>
Therefore, the mixtures according to the invention, owing to a lower and more<br>
uniform evaporation per unit of time, resulting in a controlled release of odoriferous<br>
molecules, can be incorporated in any application requiring the effect of prolonged<br>
liberation of an odoriferous component as defined hereinabove and furthermore can<br>
impart a fragrance and a freshness to a treated surface which will last well beyond the<br><br>
rinsing and/or drying processes. Suitable surfaces are, in particular, textiles, hard surfaces,<br>
hair and skin.<br>
Consequently, the invention concerns also in particular consumer article in the<br>
form of a perfumed article comprising:<br>
i) as perfuming ingredient, a delivery system as defined above; and<br>
ii) a liquid consumer product b ase;<br>
is also an object of the present invention.<br>
Preferably, in perfumed articles the liquid consumer product base has a total molar<br>
amount of aldehydes and/or ketones which is equal or higher than the molar amount of<br>
hydrazine derivatives of the delivery system.<br>
For the sake of clarity, it has to be mentioned that, by "liquid consumer product<br>
base" we mean here a consumer product which is compatible with a perfume or<br>
perfuming ingredients and which is not a solid, e.g. a more or less viscous solution, a<br>
suspension, an emulsion, a gel or a cream. In other words, a perfumed article according to<br>
the invention comprises the functional formulation, as well as optionally additional<br>
benefit agents, corresponding to a consumer product, e.g. a conditioner, a softener or an<br>
air freshener, and an olfactivly effective amount of an invention's dynamic mixture.<br>
The nature and type of the constituents of the liquid consumer product base do not<br>
warrant a more detailed description here, which in any case would not be exhaustive, the<br>
skilled person being able to select them on the basis of its general knowledge and<br>
according to the nature and the desired effect of said article.<br>
Suitable consumer products comprise liquid detergents and fabric softeners as well<br>
as all the other articles common in perfumery, namely perfumes, colognes or after-shave<br>
lotions, perfumed liquid soaps, shower or bath mousses, oils or gels, hygiene products or<br>
hair care products such as shampoos, body-care products, liquid based deodorants or<br>
antiperspirants, air fresheners comprising a liquid perfuming ingredient and also cosmetic<br>
preparations. As detergents are intended applications such as detergent compositions or<br>
cleaning products for washing up or for cleaning various surfaces, e.g. intended for textile,<br>
dish or hard-surface treatment, whether they are intended for domestic or industrial use.<br>
Other perfumed articles are fabric refreshers, ironing waters, papers, wipes or bleaches.<br>
Preferred consumer products are perfumes, air fresheners, cosmetic preparations,<br>
softener bases or hair care products.<br><br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, it is also possible to have a<br>
perfumed article comprising:<br>
i) a hydrazine derivative of formula (I);<br>
ii) a perfume or perfuming composition containing at least one perfuming aldehyde or<br>
ketone having a molecular weight comprised between 80 and 230 g/mol; and<br>
iii) a solid consumer product base intended to be used in the presence of water.<br>
In such a case, the invention's dynamic mixture will be formed once the consumer<br>
article is used by the consumer, since water will be present. Examples of such solid<br>
consumer product bases intended to be used in presence of water include powder<br>
detergents or "ready to use" powdered air fresheners.<br>
Typical examples of fabric detergents or softener compositions into which the<br>
compounds of the invention can be incorporated are described in Ullman's Encyclopedia<br>
of Industrial Chemistry, vol. A8, pages 315-448 (1987) and vol. A25, pages 747-817<br>
(1994); Flick, Advanced Cleaning Product Formulations, Noye Publication, Park Ridge,<br>
New Jersey (1989); Showell, in Surfactant Science Series, vol. 71: Powdered Detergents,<br>
Marcel Dekker, New York (1988); Proceedings of the World Conference on Detergents<br>
(4th, 1998, Montreux, Switzerland), AOCS print.<br>
Some of the above-mentioned articles may represent an aggressive medium for the<br>
invention's compounds, so that it may be necessary to protect the latter from premature<br>
decomposition, for example by encapsulation.<br>
The proportions in which the delivery system according to the invention can be<br>
incorporated into the various aforementioned articles or compositions vary within a wide<br>
range of values. These values are dependent on the nature of the article or product to be<br>
perfumed and on the desired olfactory effect as well as the nature of the co-ingredients in<br>
a given composition when the dynamic mixtures according to the invention are mixed<br>
with perfuming co-ingredients, solvents or additives commonly used in the art.<br>
For example, typical concentrations are in the order of 0.1 % to 30 % by weight, or<br>
even more, of the invention's delivery system based on the weight of the composition into<br>
which they are incorporated. Concentrations lower than these, such as in the order of<br>
0.01% to 5% by weight, can be used when these delivery systems are applied directly in<br>
the perfuming of the various consumer products mentioned hereinabove.<br><br>
Another object of the present invention relates to a method for the perfuming of a<br>
surface characterized in that said surface is treated in the presence of a dynamic mixture<br>
as defined above. Suitable surfaces are, in particular, textiles, hard surfaces, hair and skin.<br>
Moreover, an additional aspect of the present invention is a method for prolonging<br>
me perfuming effect of a perfuming aldehyde or ketone, as defined above, characterized in<br>
that there is added at least one hydrazine derivative of formula (I), as defined above, to a<br>
perfuming composition containing at least one perfuming aldehyde or ketone, as defined<br>
above, and water. In other words, the use of a hydrazine derivative, as defined above, as<br>
additive to prolong the perfuming effect of a perfuming compositions containing at least<br>
one perforating compound as defined above and water.<br>
The invention will now be described in further detail by way of the following<br>

Use of active aldehydes or ketones<br>
The following examples illustrate the formation of dynamic mixtures using perfuming or<br>
flavoring ingredients as active aldehydes or ketones. However, they are also representative<br>
for the generation of dynamic mixtures according to the present invention in which the<br>
active aldehydes or ketones are useful as insect repellants or attractants, or as bactericides<br>
or fungicides. Some of the compounds described in the following examples, such as<br>
benzaldehyde, decanal, 2,4-drmethyl-3-cyclohexene-l-carbaldehyde, 3,7-dimethyl-6-<br>
octenal (citronellal), 2-furancarbaldehyde (furfural), 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde<br>
(vanillin), menthone, 1-(4-methylphenyl)-1-ethanone (4-methylacetophenone), 3-octanone,<br>
2-pentyl-1-cyclopentanone (Delphone), 3-phenyl-2-propenal (cinnamic aldehyde), or<br>
10-undecenal, are also known to be insect attractants or repellents (see for example: A. M.<br>
El-Sayed, The Pherobase 2005, http://www.pherobase.net) and/or to be active against<br>
bacteria (see for example: WO 01/24769 or EP 1 043 968).<br>
Example 1<br>
Formation of a dynamic mixture using Girard-T reagent as hydrazine derivative and<br>
cinnamic aldehyde as perfuming compound<br>
The formation the dynamic mixture was monitored by 1SIMR spectroscopy in buffered<br>
aqueous solution (D2O/CD3OD 2:1 (v/v)). An acidic deuterated buffer stock solution was<br>
prepared from the following product quantities:<br><br>
Formation by hydrolysis of the hydrazone 3c<br>
The formation of the invention's dynamic mixture by contacting hydrazone 3c and water<br>
was monitored by adding 0.7 ml of the deuterated buffer solution to 9.6 mg of 3c.<br>
1H-NMR spectra were recorded at different time intervals on a Bruker AV 500<br>
spectrometer using sodium 3-trimethylsilyltetradeuteriopropionate (DSP) as lock signal.<br><br>
The appearance of a doublet at 9.58 ppm indicated the formation of cinnamic aldehyde, the<br>
structure of which was confirmed by recording a 13C-NMR spectrum at the end of the<br>
experiment.<br>
Formation by reacting the hydrazine derivative 3a with cinnamic aldehyde<br>
Similarly, formation of the invention's dynamic mixture by contacting 0.7 ml of the<br>
deuterated buffer solution and a mixture of 4.5 mg of cinnamic aldehyde and 5.9 mg of<br>
hydrazine derivative 3 a was monitored by NMR. This resulted in the appearance of two<br>
doublets at 8.07 and 7.84 ppm, corresponding to the N=CH protons of the two isomers of<br>
hydrazone 3c. The identity of compound 3c was confirmed by 13C-NMR analysis of the<br>
reaction mixture at the equilibrium.<br>
In both cases and under the given conditions the equilibrium is reached very rapidly (about<br>
10-15 rnin).<br>
Example 2<br>
Measurement of kinetic rate constants for the formation of dynamic mixtures<br>
The formation of the dynamic mixtures was monitored by UV/Vis spectroscopy and the<br>
kinetic rate constants were measured in buffered aqueous solution (water/ethanol 2:1 (v/v))<br>
at a product concentration of ca 1.7 X 10-5 M.<br>
a) Preparation of a citric acid buffer stock solution used as the reaction medium<br>
The following product quantities were weighed into a volumetric flask:<br><br><br>
10 ml of the buffer stock solution were diluted with 2 ml of ethanol to give a mixture<br>
of water/ethanol 2:1 (v/v) (corresponding to the final reaction solution used for the<br>
kinetic measurements). The pH value of this solution was 4.48 (±0.021), at 25.0°C<br>
(±0.30).<br>
b)	Preparation of a phosphoric acid buffer stock solution used as the reaction medium<br>
The following product quantities were weighed into a volumetric flask:<br><br>
The pH value of the buffer in water/ethanol 2:1 (v/v) (obtained by diluting 10 ml of<br>
the buffer stock solution with 2 ml of ethanol) was 2.47 (±0.045), at 25.0°C (±0.36).<br>
c)	Determination of the equilibria of dynamic mixtures<br>
All reactions were carried out in quartz cuvettes (1 cm) by adding either 0.2 ml of<br>
hydrazine derivative and 0.2 ml of cinnamic aldehyde (CA) or benzaldehyde (BA) (all<br>
at 2.0 x 10-4 M in ethanol) to 2 ml of the buffer stock solution prepared above or,<br>
alternatively, by adding 0.4 ml of the corresponding hydrazone (at 1.0 x 10-4 M in<br>
ethanol) to 2 ml of the buffer stock solution. UV/Vis spectra were recorded at constant<br>
time intervals between 240 and 450 nm. The first spectrum was recorded 2-3 min after<br>
addition of the compounds to the buffer solution, the following spectra were taken at<br>
intervals of 5 or 10 min (pH 2.47) or 30 or 60 min (pH 4.48), respectively.<br>
If complete hydrolysis of the hydrazone takes place, the UV absorption at a given<br>
wavelength should change from that of the pure hydrazone (Ah) to reach the one<br>
corresponding to the mixture of the hydrazine derivative and the aldehyde/ketone<br>
(Aa+ti)- The inverse is expeeted for the formation of the hydrazone from the<br>
corresponding aldehyde/ketone and a hydrazine derivative. If in the course of the<br>
reaction the absorption approaches a constant value lying between these two extrema,<br><br>
an equilibrium state is reached and an "equilibrium value" xeq can be defined, which<br>
indicates to which point the reaction proceeds in either direction at a given wavelength<br>
(X).<br><br>
For a given dynamic mixture xe/ is the equilibrium value for the formation of the<br>
dynamic mixture by contacting a hydrazine derivative with the aldehyde or ketone in<br>
water, xeqA the equilibrium value for the dynamic mixture by contacting the hydrazone<br>
derivative with water, and A^q is the absorption reached at the equihbrium.<br>
Under the conditions described above, the formation of a dynamic mixture either by<br>
hydrolysis of the hydrazone (lc, 2c, 2b or 14b) or by reaction between the hydrazine<br>
derivative (la, 2a or 14a) and benzaldehyde or cinnamic aldehyde, respectively, gave<br>
the following equilibrium values xeq at 1=290 nm (BA) or 1=320 nm (CA):<br><br>
If the values for Xeq are both either 1 or 0, the hydrazone formation or the hydrazone<br>
hydrolysis go to completion, respectively. As can be noticed, the mixtures are the<br>
result of reversible reactions between various starting components, as the measured<br>
"equilibrium values" xeq are larger than 0 and smaller than 1.<br><br>
Within the experimental error of the measurements, of approximately ± 0.1, the same<br>
equilibrium state is reached independently of the stating point (i.e. hydrazine<br>
derivative, aldehyde and water or hydrazone and water).<br>
It may happen, for other active aldehydes/ketones or hydrazine derivatives, that the<br>
equilibration is relatively slow, and that within the timeframe of the experiment such<br>
equilibrium is not fully reached, but this does not imply that the dynamic mixtures<br>
obtained by either contacting the hydrazine derivative and the active compound in<br>
water or by contacting the hydrazone derivative and water are not the same.<br>
The UV/Vis spectra recorded for the formation and hydrolysis of hydrazone derivative<br>
lc are shown in Figure (I).<br>
Determination of the rate constants for the formation of various dynamic mixtures by<br>
contacting the hydrazine derivatives and the active aldehydes/ketones in water<br>
Using the same reaction conditions as described above, see Example 2c), the rate<br>
constants were detennined, from the change of absorption measured at 290 run<br>
(benzaldehyde) or 320 nm (cinnamic aldehyde and vanillin), according to the method<br>
described by Guggenheim (Phil. Mag. [7] 1926, 2, 538-543). With At = 1 or 2 h (pH<br>
2.47) or At = 7.5 or 15 h (pH 4.48), the kinetics were found to be of pseudo first order<br>
(r2 &gt; 0.99) and the following rate constants were obtained for the formation of<br>
hydrazine addition products:<br><br><br><br>
e) Determination of the rate constants for the formation of dynamic mixtures by<br>
contacting hydrazone derivatives and water<br>
The UV/Vis spectra were recorded and the rate constants determined as described<br>
above to give the following values for the hydrolysis of hydrazones:<br><br><br><br><br><br>
The perfuming performance, over time, of the free perfuming aldehydes/ketones and of the<br>
invention's mixtures (i.e. the free perfuming aldehydes/ketones with an hydrazine<br>
derivative as additive) was determined in the following experiments:<br>
a) Fragrance release from a dynamic mixture contaning hydrazine derivative 3a<br>
1.80 g of the above fabric softener base were weighed into four small vials,<br>
respectively. Then 1 ml of a solution containing equimolar amounts (0.41 mmol) of<br>
3-phenylbutanal (Trifernal®, 60.7 mg), 10-undecenal (69.0 mg), (Z)~4-dodecenal<br>
(74.7mg), (R)-3,7-dimethyl-6-octenal (citronellal, 63.3 mg), 4-phenyl-2-butanone<br>
(benzylacetone, 60.6 mg) and 1 -phenyl- 1-ethanone (acetophenone, 48.9 mg) in 10 ml<br>
of ethanol was added to each vial. Then, 1 ml of a solution containing 415.0 mg<br>
(2.48mmol) of hydrazine derivative 3a in 10 ml of water was added to two of the<br>
samples, and 1 ml of water was added to the other two samples serving as the<br>
reference. All four samples were closed and left standing at room temperature to<br>
equilibrate. After 5 days, the samples were dispersed in a beaker with 600 ml of<br>
demineralized cold tap water, respectively. One cotton towel (EMPA cotton test cloth<br>
Nr. 221, origin: Eidgenossische Materialprufanstalt (EMPA), pre-washed with an<br>
unperfumed detergent powder and cut to ca. 12 x 12 cm sheets) was added to each<br>
beaker and agitated manually for 3 min, left standing for 2 min, then wrung out by<br>
hand and weighed to obtain a constant quantity of residual water. Two of the towels<br>
(one with hydrazine derivative and one without) were analyzed immediately after<br>
treatment with the softener, the other two were left drying overnight and analyzed the<br>
next day. Each towel was put into an headspace sampling cell (160 ml) thermostatted<br>
at 25°C and exposed to a constant air flow of 200 ml/min, respectively. The air was<br>
filtered through active charcoal and aspirated through a saturated solution of NaCl (to<br>
ensure a constant humidity of the air of ca. 75%). During 15 min the headspace<br>
system was left equilibrating, then the volatiles' were adsorbed during 5 min (wet<br>
towels) or 15 min (dry towels) on a clean Tenax® cartridge, respectively. The<br>
sampling was repeated 7 times every 50 min (wet towels) or every hour (dry towels).<br>
The cartridges were desorbed on a Perkin Elmer TurboMatrix ATD desorber coupled<br>
to a Carlo Erba MFC 500 gas chromatograph equipped with a J&amp;W Scientific DB1<br><br>
capillary column (30 m, i.d. 0.45 mm, film 0.42 um) and a FID detector. The volatiles<br>
were analyzed using a two step temperature gradient starting from 70°C to 130°C at<br>
3°C/min and then going to 260°C at 25°C/min. The injection temperature was at<br>
240°C, the detector temperature at 260°C. Headspace concentrations (in ng/1) were<br>
obtained by external standard calibrations of the corresponding fragrance aldehydes<br>
and ketones using ethanol solutions of five different concentrations. 0.2 (il of each<br>
calibration solution was injected onto Tenax® cartridges, which were immediately<br>
desorbed under the same conditions as those resulting from the headspace sampling.<br>
The following amounts of aldehydes and ketones were detected from the sample<br>
containing hydrazine derivative 3a as compared to the reference sample without 3a (in<br>
brackets):<br><br>
The data clearly illustrate that the presence of the hydrazine derivative 3 a has a<br>
positive effect on the long-lastingness of the fragrance aldehydes and ketones.<br>
Especially the headspace concentrations measured at the end of the experiment on dry<br>
fabric were found to be between 1.4 ((Z)-4-dodecenal) and 20 (acetophenone) times<br>
higher in the presence of 3 a than in its absence.<br>
The kinetics of the fragrance release measured on dry fabric are illustrated in<br>
Figure (H).<br>
b) Fragrance release from a dynamic mixture contaning hydrazine derivative 14a<br>
The experiment was carried out as described above by adding 1 ml of' a solution<br>
containing equimolar amounts (0.81 mmol) of 2-furancarbaldehyde (furfural,<br><br>
78.2mg), 3-octanone (105.3 mg), 2,4,6-trimemyl-3-cyclohexene4-carbaldehyde<br>
(125.5 mg), l-(4-methylph.enyl)-l-ethanone (4-methylacetophenone, 110.5 mg),<br>
2-pentyl-l-cyclopentanone (Delphone, 126.2 mg) and (±)-exo-<br>
Mcyclo[5.2.1.0(2,6)]decane-8exo-carbaldehyde (Vertral® 135.2 mg) in 20 ml of<br>
ethanol to four vials each containing 1.80 g of the above fabric softener base. Then,<br>
lml of a solution containing 214.4 mg (1.23 mmol) of hydrazine derivative 14a in<br>
10ml of water was added to two of the samples, and 1 ml of water was added to the<br>
other two samples serving as the reference.<br>
The following amounts of aldehydes and ketones were detected from the sample<br>
containing hydrazine derivative 14a as compared to the reference sample without 14a<br>
(in brackets):<br><br>
The data clearly illustrate that the presence of the hydrazine derivative 14a has a<br>
positive effect on the long-lastingness of the fragrance aldehydes and ketones. The<br>
headspace concentrations measured on wet fabric were for some ingredients higher,<br>
and for some a little lower, in the presence of 14a than in its absence. However, the<br>
headspace concentrations measured on dry fabric at the end of the experiment were<br>
generally higher in the presence of 14a than in its absence.<br><br>
c) Fragrance release from a dynamic mixture contaning hydrazine derivative 16a<br>
The experiment was carried out as described above by adding 1 ml of a solution<br>
containing equimolar amounts (0.41 mmol) of (-)-menthone (63.8 mg), (±)-exo-<br>
tricyclo[5.2.1.0(2,6)]decane-8exo-carbaldehyde (Vertral®, 67.8 mg), 3,5,5-<br>
trimethylhexanal (58.0 mg), (+)-(S)-l(6),8-p-menthadien-2-one (carvone, 61.4 mg),<br>
4-(2,6,6-trimethyl-2-cycloliexen-l-yl)-2-butanone (a-dihydroionone, 80.1 mg) and<br>
decanal (63.3 mg) in 10 ml of ethanol to four vials each containing 1.80 g of the<br>
above fabric softener base. Then, 1 ml of a solution containing 218.9 mg (1.23 mmol)<br>
of hydrazine derivative 16a in 10 ml of water was added to two of the samples, and<br>
lml of water was added to the other two samples serving as the reference.<br>
The following amounts of aldehydes and ketones were detected from the sample<br>
containing hydrazine derivative 16a as compared to the reference sample without 16a<br>
(in brackets):<br><br>
The data clearly illustrate that the presence of the hydrazine derivative 16a has a<br>
positive effect on the long-lastingness of the fragrance aldehydes and ketones. The<br>
headspace concentrations measured on wet fabric were for some ingredients higher,<br>
and for some a little lower, in the presence of 16a than in its absence. However, the<br>
headspace concentrations measured on dry fabric at the end of the experiment were<br>
higher in the presence of 16a than in its absence.<br><br>
d) Fragrance release from a dynamic mixture contaning hydrazine derivative 18a<br>
The experiment was carried out as described above by adding 1 ml of a solution<br>
containing equimolar amounts (0.41 rnmol) of 2-furancarbaldehyde (furfural,<br>
39.1mg), 10-undecenal (69.0 mg), benzaldehyde (44.0 mg), (R)-3,7-dimethyl-6-<br>
octenal (citronellal, 63.4 mg), 2-pentyl-l-cyclopentanone (Delphone, 62.7 mg) and<br>
l-(4-methylphenyl)-l-ethanone (4-methylacetophenone, 54.6 mg) in 10 ml of ethanol<br>
to four vials each containing 1.80 g of the above fabric softener base. Then, 1 ml of a<br>
solution containing 192.1 mg (0.82 rnmol) of hydrazine derivative 18a in 10 ml of<br>
water was added to two of the samples, and 1 ml of water was added to the other two<br>
samples serving as the reference.<br>
The following amounts of aldehydes and ketones were detected from the sample<br>
containing hydrazine derivative 18a as compared to the reference sample without 18a<br>
(in brackets):<br><br>
The data clearly illustrate that the presence of the hydrazine derivative 18a has a<br>
positive effect on the lohg-lastingness of the fragrance aldehydes and ketones. As in<br>
the previous example, the positive effect was found for five of the fragrance<br>
molecules on wet and for all six compounds on dry fabric. The headspace<br>
concentrations measured on dry fabric at the end of the experiment were all between<br>
4 (citronellal) and 60 (4-methylacetophenone) times higher in the presence of 18a<br>
than in its absence.<br><br>
The same experiment was carried out with the humidity of the air being ca. 33% (by<br>
aspirating the air through a saturated solution of MgC^). The measured headspace<br>
concentrations on dry fabric were found to be in the same order of magnitude as those<br>
recorded at an air humidity of 75%.<br>
e) Fragrance release from a dynamic mixture contaning hydrazine derivative 19a<br>
The experiment was carried out as described above by adding 1 ml of a solution<br>
containing equimolar amounts (0.41 mmol) of 5-methyl-3-heptanone (52.9 mg), 2,4-<br>
dimethyl-3-cyclohexene-l-carbaldehyde (Triplal®, 56.3 mg), 4-ethylbenzaldehyde<br>
(55.1 mg), 6-methoxy-2,6-dimethylheptanal (methoxymelonal, 70.4 mg), (+)-(S)-<br>
l(6),8-p-menthadien-2-one (carvone, 61.5 mg) and 2-methyldecanal (69.8 mg) in 10<br>
ml of ethanol to four vials each containing 1.80 g of the above fabric softener base.<br>
Then, 1 ml of a solution containing 211.5 mg (2.46 mmol) of hydrazine derivative<br>
19a in 10 ml of water was added to two of the samples, and 1 ml of water was added<br>
to the other two samples serving as the reference.<br>
The following amounts of aldehydes and ketones were detected from the sample<br>
containing hydrazine derivative 19a as compared to the reference sample without 19a<br>
(in brackets):<br><br>
The data clearly illustrate that the presence of the hydrazine derivative 19a has a<br>
positive effect on the long-lastingness of the fragrance aldehydes and ketones. The<br><br>
headspace concentrations measured on wet fabric were for some ingredients higher,<br>
and for some a little lower, in the presence of 19a than in its absence. However, the<br>
headspace concentrations measured on dry fabric at the end of the experiment were<br>
generally higher in the presence of 19a than in its absence.<br>
f) Fragrance release from a dynamic mixture contaning hydrazone derivatives Id, le,<br>
2e, 8d, 9b and 14e<br>
The experiment was carried out as described above by adding 1 ml of a solution<br>
containing hydrazone derivatives Id (112.8 mg), le (118.0 mg), 2e (107.6 mg), 8d<br>
(117.8 mg), 9b (98.3 mg) and 14e (89.2 mg) in 10 ml of ethanol to two vials,<br>
respectively, each containing 1.80 g of the above fabric softener base. Then, 1 ml of a<br>
solution containing equimolar amounts (0.41 mmol) of (R)-3,7-dimethyl-6-octenal<br>
(citronellal, 63.3 mg), 3-phenylbutanal (Trifernal®, 60.9 mg), 10-undecenal (69.5mg),<br>
benzaldehyde (43.6 mg), 4-phenyl-2-butanone (benzylacetone, 60.9 mg) and<br>
1 -phenyl- 1-ethanone (acetophenone, 48.7 mg) in 10 ml ethanol was added to another<br>
two vials, respectively, each containing 1.80 g of the above fabric softener base, and<br>
serving as the reference.<br>
The following amounts of aldehydes and ketones were detected from the sample<br>
containing the mixture of hydrazone derivatives as compared to the reference sample<br>
with the corresponding fragrance molecules (in brackets):<br><br><br>
The data clearly illustrate that the dynamic mixture obtained from the hydrazone<br>
derivatives has a positive effect on the long-lastingness of the fragrance aldehydes<br>
and ketones as compared to the unmodified free fragrance molecules.<br>
The headspace concentrations measured on wet or dry fabric were for all ingredients,<br>
except one, higher in the sample containing the hydrazone derivatives than in the<br>
sample with the fragrances. The only exception was 10-undecenal, nevertheless a<br>
positive effect of the dynamic mixture was obtained on dry fabric.<br>
Example 4<br>
Washing cycle using a softener base comprising an invention's dynamic mixture<br>
The use as perfuming ingredient of the present invention's dynamic mixtures in a softener<br>
base was tested by olfactive evaluation on fabric after a machine-washing cycle.<br>
A fabric softener base with the following composition has been prepared:<br><br>
Fragrance accords containing active aldehydes and ketones together with other perfuming<br>
co-ingredients with the following composition were used:<br><br><br><br>
Dynamic mixtures were prepared by adding either 100 mg of 10-undecenal or,<br>
alternatively, 1 g of either one of the above mentioned accords, respectively, to 100 g of<br>
the fabric softener base described above. Then 0.5 or 1.0 molar equivalent of hydrazine<br>
derivative 4a or 14a with respect to the total amount of active aldehyde or ketone in the<br>
mixture was added. The resulting mixtures were shaken for 5 min, and then left<br>
equilibrating for at least 5 d at room temperature prior to a use in a wash test.<br><br><br>
For the wash test, three large cotton terry towels (45 x 90 cm) and three small cotton terry<br>
towels (28 x 28 cm) were washed in a Miele Novotronic W300-33CH washing machine<br>
with 85 g of an unperfumed detergent powder (Via, origin: Unilever, Stockholm, Sweden),<br>
using a short cycle at 40°C with 900 RPM for the spinning cycle. Once the cycle was<br>
finished 2.5 1 of water were added to the machine through the dispensing tray, and a new<br>
short cycle called "ammidonage" was started. As soon as the machine was drawing water,<br>
a solution of 35 g of the fabric softener bases (containing either one of the above<br>
mentioned dynamic mixtures) diluted into 2.5 1 of water was added via the dispensing tray.<br>
Once the cycle was finished the cotton terry towels were line dried for 24 h and then<br>
evaluated by two experts.<br>
All evaluations were done in comparison to a control sample that did not contain any<br>
hydrazine (or hydrazone) derivative. Accords were compared to the corresponding accord<br>
that did not contain the hydrazine derivative. The following results were obtained:<br>
Entry 1: Just out of the washing machine the odor of 10-undecenal was much weaker<br>
in the' presence of hydrazine derivative 14a when compared to a sample perfumed<br>
with just the aldehyde. However, after 3, 7 and 14 d, the sample containing the<br>
invention's dynamic mixture was clearly stronger than the control sample without the<br>
hydrazine derivative.<br>
Entries 2, 3 and 4: The same effect as in Entry 1 was observed. The perception of the<br>
aldehydic note was prolonged in the presence of the dynamic mixture, whereas the<br>
control sample without hydrazine derivative did not smell anymore after 3 d of drying.<br>
Entry 5: After 3, 7 and 14 d, the sample containing the dynamic mixture was found to<br>
have a clearly stronger and fresher odor with a better volume than the reference<br>
sample without hydrazine derivative 14a.<br>
Entry 6: Again, the odor resulting from the sample containing the dynamic mixture<br>
was perceived as stronger and fresher and had more volume than the reference sample<br>
without hydrazine derivative 14a.<br><br>
The samples containing the dynamic mixtures according to the invention were always<br>
rated stronger and fresher after 3, 7 and 14 d after the wash. The effect resulting from the<br>
presence of the hydrazine derivative is clearly perceived, and the presence of the<br>
invention's dynamic mixture thus helps to retain fresher notes on dry fabric.<br><br>
The perfuming performance, over time, of the free perfuming aldehydes/ketones and of the<br>
invention's mixtures (i.e. the free perfuming aldehydes/ketones with an hydrazine<br>
derivative as additive) has been determined in the following experiments:<br><br>
a) Fragrance release from a dynamic mixture containing hydrazine derivative 20a<br>
2.00 g of the above shampoo base were weighed into four small vials, respectively.<br>
Then 200 pi of a solution containing equhnolar amounts (0.6 mmol) of 3,5,5-<br>
trimethylhexanal (85.3 mg), (R)-3,7-dirnethyl-6-octenal (citronellal, 92.6 mg), decanal<br>
(93.9 mg), 4-phenyl-2-butanone (benzylacetone, 89.0 mg), 10-undecenal (100.9 mg)<br>
and (±)-exo-tricyclo[5.2.1.0(2,6)]decane-8exo-carbaldehyde (Vertral®, 98.8 mg) in<br>
10ml of ethanol were added to each vial. Furthermore, to two of the samples 13.7 mg<br>
(0.072 mmol) of hydrazine derivative 20a were added. The four samples were then<br>
closed and left standing at room temperature to equilibrate for 5 d. Four hair swatches<br>
(ca. 5 g, origin: A. &amp; C. Secher Fesnoux, Industrie du cheveu, Chaville, France) were<br>
wetted with tap water (at ca. 35°C), washed with 1.0 g of the above mentioned<br>
unperfumed shampoo base and rinsed with water, respectively. Two of the hair<br>
swatches were then washed for 1 min with 0.5 g of the shampoo base containing the<br>
perfumery aldehydes and ketones together with hydrazine derivative 20a, the other<br>
two with 0.5 g of the shampoo base containing only the perfumery aldehydes and<br>
ketones. The hair swatches were each rinsed for 30 s. The washing was repeated a<br>
second time with another 0.5 g of the respective shampoo bases. After leaving for<br>
2rnin, the swatches were rinsed with water (at 25°C) for 1 min and pre-dried shortly<br>
with household paper. Two of the swatches (one with hydrazine derivative 20a and<br>
one without) were analyzed immediately after treatment with the shampoo, the other<br>
two were left drying overnight and analyzed the next day. Each hair swatch was put<br>
into a headspace sampling cell (160 ml) thermostatted at 25°C and exposed to a<br>
constant air flow of 200 ml/min, respectively. The air was filtered through active<br>
charcoal and aspirated through a saturated solution of NaCl (to ensure a constant<br>
humidity of the air of ca. 75%). During 55 min the headspace system was left<br>
equilibrating, then the volatiles were adsorbed during 10 min (wet swatches) or 15min<br>
(dry swatches) on a clean Tenax® cartridge. The sampling was repeated 8 times every<br>
30 min. The cartridges were desorbed on a Perkin Elmer ATD-400 desorber coupled<br>
to an Agilent 6890 N gas chromatograph equipped with an Agilent HP 5 HS capillary<br>
column (30 m, i.d. 0.25 mm, film 0.25 urn)'and an Agilent MSD 5973 N mass<br>
sensitive detector. The volatiles were analyzed using a two-step temperature gradient<br>
starting from 70°C to 130°C at 3°C/min and then going to 260°C at 25°C/min. The<br><br>
injection temperature was at 240°C, the detector temperature at 260°C, the inlet<br>
pressure at 62 kPa. Headspace concentrations (in ng/1) were obtained by external<br>
standard calibrations of the corresponding fragrance aldehydes and ketones using<br>
ethanol solutions of five different concentrations. 1 jil of each calibration solution was<br>
injected onto Tenax® cartridges, which were immediately desorbed under the same<br>
conditions as those resulting from the headspace sampling.<br>
The following amounts of aldehydes and ketones were detected from the sample<br>
containing hydrazine derivative 20a as compared to the reference sample without 20a<br>
(in brackets):<br><br>
The data clearly illustrate that the presence of the hydrazine derivative 20a has a<br>
positive effect on the long-lastingness of the fragrance aldehydes and ketones. The<br>
headspace concentrations measured on wet and on dry hair are generally higher (or at<br>
least equal) in the presence of the hydrazine derivative than in its absence. Whereas in<br>
the case of 10-undecenal equal headspace concentrations were measured in both cases,<br>
the presence of the hydrazine derivative 20a increased the headspace concentration of<br>
3,5,5-rrimethylb.exanal by a factor of 3 (dry hair) to 4 (wet hair) as compared to the<br>
reference sample without 20a. It is therefore possible to use a complex perfuming<br>
composition and modify the evaporation behavior of only a part of the ingredients<br>
while mamtaining the others unchanged.<br><br>
b) Fragrance release from a dynamic mixture containing hydrazone derivative 12d<br>
The experiment was carried out as described above by adding 200 µl of a solution<br>
containing 3,5,5-trimethylhexanal (85.4 mg) in 10 ml of ethanol to two of the vials,<br>
and 3.4 mg (0.012 mmol) of hydrazone derivative 12d to the other two vials.<br>
The following amounts of aldehyde was detected from the sample containing<br>
hydrazone derivative 12d as compared to the reference sample with the corresponding<br>
fragrance molecule (in brackets):<br><br>
The data clearly illustrate that the dynamic mixture obtained from hydrazone<br>
derivative 12d has a positive effect on the long-lastingness of the fragrance aldehyde<br>
as compared to the unmodified free fragrance molecules.<br><br>
