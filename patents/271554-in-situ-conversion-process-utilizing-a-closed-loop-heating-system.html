BACKGROUND<br>
1-	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to methods and systems for production of hydrocarbons, hydrogen,<br>
and/or other products from various subsurface formations such as hydrocarbon containing formations. In particular,<br>
certain embodiments relate to using a closed loop circulation system for heating a portion of the formation during an<br>
in situ conversion process.<br>
- 2.	Description of Related Art<br>
Hydrocarbons obtained from subterranean formations are often used as energy resources, as feedstocks, and as consumer products. Concerns over depletion of available hydrocarbon resources and concerns over declining overall quality of produced hydrocarbons have led to development of processes for more efficient recovery, processing and/or use of available hydrocarbon resources. In situ processes may be used to remove hydrocarbon materials from subterranean formations. Chemical and/or physical properties of hydrocarbon material in a subterranean formation may need to be changed to allow hydrocarbon material to be more easily removed from the subterranean formation. The chemical and physical changes may include in situ reactions that produce removable fluids, composition changes, solubility changes, density changes, phase changes, and/or viscosity changes of the hydrocarbon material in the formation. A fluid may be, but is not limited to, a gas, a liquid, an emulsion, a slurry, and/or a stream of solid particles that has flow characteristics similar to liquid flow.<br>
As outlined above, there has been a significant amount of effort to develop methods and systems to economically produce hydrocarbons, hydrogen, and/or other products from hydrocarbon containing formations. At present, however, there are still many hydrocarbon containing formations from which hydrocarbons, hydrogen, and/or other products cannot be economically produced. Thus, there is still a need for improved methods and systems for production of hydrocarbons, hydrogen, and/or other products from various hydrocarbon containing formations.<br>

The following description generally relates to systems and methods for treating hydrocarbons in the formations. Such formations may be treated to yield hydrocarbon products, hydrogen, and other products.<br>
"Hydrocarbons" are generally defined as molecules formed primarily by carbon and hydrogen atoms. Hydrocarbons may also include other elements such as, but not limited to, halogens, metallic elements, nitrogen, oxygen, and/or sulfur. Hydrocarbons may be, but are not limited to, kerogen, bitumen, pyrobitumen, oils, natural mineral waxes, and asphaltites. Hydrocarbons may be located in or adjacent to mineral matrices in the earth. Matrices may include, but are not limited to, sedimentary rock, sands, silicilytes, carbonates, diatomites, and other porous media. "Hydrocarbon fluids" are fluids that include hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbon fluids may include, entrain, or be entrained in non-hydrocarbon fluids such as hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, water, and ammonia.<br>
A "formation" includes one or more hydrocarbon containing layers, one or more non-hydrocarbon layers, an overburden, and/or an underburden. The "overburden" and/or the "underburden" include one or more different types of impermeable materials. For example, overburden and/or underburden may include rock, shale, mudstone,<br><br>
m &amp;tffi^t$lMMt£. ifrOTbS-tf&amp;ments of in situ conversion processes, fee overburden and/or the underbidden may include a hydrocarbon containing layer or hydrocarbon containing layers that are relatively impermeable and are not subjected to temperatures during in situ conversion processing that result in significant characteristic changes of the hydrocarbon containing layers of the overburden and/or the underburden. For example, the underburden may contain shale or mudstone, but the underburden is not allowed to heat to pyrolysis temperatures during the in situ conversion process. In some cases, the overburden and/or fee underburden may be somewhat permeable.<br>
"Formation fluids" refer to fluids present in a formation and may include pyrolyzation fluid, synthesis gas, mobilized hydrocarbon, and water (steam). Formation fluids may include hydrocarbon fluids as well as non-hydrocarbon fluids. The term "mobilized fluid" refers to fluids in a hydrocarbon containing formation that are able to flow as a result of thermal treatment of the formation. "Produced fluids" refer to formation fluids removed from fee formation.<br>
'Thermally conductive fluid" includes fluid that has a higher thermal conductivity than air at standard temperature and pressure (STP) (0 °C and 101325 kPa).<br>
A (Cheat source" is any system for providing heat to at least a portion of a formation substantially by conductive and/or radiative heat transfer. For example, a heat source may include electric heaters such as an insulated conductor, an elongated member, and/or a conductor disposed in a conduit A heat source may also include systems that generate heat by burning a fuel external to or in a formation. The systems may be surface burners, downhole gas burners, flameless distributed combustors, and natural distributed combustors. In some embodiments, heat provided to or generated in one or more heat sources may be supplied by other sources of energy. The other sources of energy may directly heat a formation, or the energy may be applied to a transfer medium that directly or indirectly heats fee formation. It is to be understood that one or more heat sources feat are applying heat to a formation may use different sources of energy. Thus, for example, for a given formation some heat sources may supply heat from electric resistance heaters, some heat sources may provide heat from combustion, and some heat sources may provide heat from one or more other energy sources (for example, chemical reactions, solar energy, wind energy, biomass, or other sources of renewable energy). A chemical reaction may include an exothermic reaction (for example, an oxidation reaction). A heat source may also include a heater feat provides heat to a zone proximate and/or surrounding a heating location such as a heater well.<br>
An "in situ conversion process" refers to a process of heating a hydrocarbon containing formation from heat sources to raise fee temperature of at least a portion of fee formation above a pyrolysis temperature so feat pyrolyzation fluid is produced in the formation.<br>
A t(heater" is any system or heat source for generating heat in a well or a near wellbore region. Heaters may be, but are not limited to, electric heaters, burners, combustors that react wife material in or produced from a formation, and/or combinations thereof.<br>
"Insulated conductor" refers to any elongated material feat is able to conduct electricity and feat is covered, in whole or in part, by an electrically insulating material.<br>
An elongated member may be a bare metal heater or an exposed metal beater. "Bare metal" and "exposed metal" refer to metals that do not include a layer of electrical insulation, such as mineral insulation, that is designed to provide electrical insulation for fee metal throughout an operating temperature range of fee elongated member. Bare metal and exposed metal may encompass a metal that includes a corrosion inhibiter such as a naturally occurring oxidation layer, an applied oxidation layer, and/or a film. Bare metal and exposed metal include metals<br><br>
"■   ~Witto poIi^fiMWtfier^^Mfecfecal insulation that cannot retain electrical insulating properties at typical operating temperature of the elongated member. Such material may be placed on the metal and may be thermally degraded during use of the heater.<br>
'Temperature limited heater" generally refers to a heater feat regulates heat output (for example, reduces heat output) above a specified temperature without fee use of external controls such as temperature controllers, power regulators, rectifiers, or other devices. Temperature limited heaters may be AC (alternating current) or modulated (for example, "chopped**) DC (direct current) powered electrical resistance heaters.<br>
"Curie temperature" is fee temperature above which a ferromagnetic material loses all of its ferromagnetic properties. In addition to losing all of its ferromagnetic properties above the Curie temperature, fee ferromagnetic material begins to lose its ferromagnetic properties when an increasing electrical current is passed through fee ferromagnetic material.<br>
'Time-varying current" refers to electrical current feat produces skin effect electricity flow in a ferromagnetic conductor and has a magnitude feat varies with time. Time-varying current includes both alternating current (AC) and modulated direct current (DC).<br>
"Alternating current (AQ" refers to a time-varying current feat reverses direction substantially sinusoidally. AC produces skin effect electricity flow in a ferromagnetic conductor.<br>
"Modulated direct current (DQ" refers to any substantially non-sinusoidal time-varying current feat produces skin effect electricity flow in a ferromagnetic conductor.<br>
"Turndown ratio" for fee temperature limited heater is fee ratio of fee highest AC or modulated DC resistance below fee Curie temperature to the lowest resistance above fee Curie temperature for a given current<br>
In fee context of reduced heat output heating systems, apparatus, and methods, the term "automatically" means such systems, apparatus, and methods function in a certain way without fee use of external control (for example, external controllers such as a controller wife a temperature sensor and a feedback loop, PID controller, or predictive controller).<br>
The term "wellbore" refers to a hole in a formation made by drilling or insertion of a conduit into fee formation. A wellbore may have a substantially circular cross section, or another cross-sectional shape. As used herein, fee terms "well" and "opening," when referring to an opening in fee formation may be used interchangeably wife the term "wellbore."<br>
A "u-shaped wellbore" refers to a wellbore feat extends from a first opening in fee formation, through at least a portion of fee formation, and out through a second opening in fee formation. In this context, fee wellbore may be only roughly in fee shape of a t!v" or V, wife the understanding that fee "legs" of fee "u" do not need to be parallel to each other, or perpendicular to the "bottom" of fee "u" for the wellbore to be considered "u-shaped".<br>
'Tyrolysis" is fee breaking of chemical bonds due to fee application of heat. For example, pyrolysis may include transforming a compound into one or more other substances by heat alone. Heat may be transferred to a section of fee formation to cause pyrolysis. In some formations, portions of fee formation and/or other materials in fee formation may promote pyrolysis through catalytic activity.<br>
'Tyrolyzation fluids" or '"pyrolysis products" refers to fluid produced substantially during pyrolysis of hydrocarbons. Fluid produced by pyrolysis reactions may mix wife other fluids in a formation. The mixture would be considered pyrolyzation fluid or pyrolyzation product As used herein, "pyrolysis zone" refers to a volume of a formation (for example, a relatively permeable formation such as a tar sands formation) feat is reacted or reacting to form a pyrolyzation fluid.<br><br>

Overview process graph<br>
Hydrocarbons in formations may be treated in various ways to produce many different products. In certain embodiments, hydrocarbons in formations are treated in stages. FIG. 1 depicts an illustration of stages of heating die hydrocarbon containing formation. FKJ. 1 also depicts an example of yield ("Y") in barrels of oil equivalent per ton (y axis) of formation fluids fiom the formation versus temperature ("T") of the heated formation in degrees Celsius (xaxis).<br>
Desorption of methane and vaporization of water occurs during stage 1 heating. Heating of the formation through stage 1 may be performed as quickly as possible. When the hydrocarbon containing formation is initially heated, hydrocarbons in the formation desorb adsorbed methane. The desorbed methane may be produced from the formation. If the hydrocarbon containing formation is heated further, water in the hydrocarbon containing formation is vaporized. Water may occupy, in some hydrocarbon containing formations, between 10% and 50% of the pore volume in the formation. In other formations, water occupies larger or smaller portions of the pore volume. Water typically is vaporized in a formation between 160 °C and 285 °C at pressures of 600 kPa absolute to 7000 kPa absolute. In some embodiments, the vaporized water produces wettability changes in the formation and/or increased formation pressure. The wettability changes and/or increased pressure may affect pyrolysis reactions or other reactions in the formation. In certain embodiments, the vaporized water is produced from the formation. In other embodiments, the vaporized water is used for steam extraction and/or distillation in the formation or outside the formation. Removing the water from and increasing the pore volume in the formation increases the storage space for hydrocarbons in the pore volume.<br>
In certain embodiments, after stage 1 heating, the formation is heated further, such that a temperature in the formation reaches (at least) an initial pyrolyzation temperature (such as a temperature at the lower end of die temperature range shown as stage 2). Hydrocarbons in the formation may be pyrolyzed throughout stage 2. A pyrolysis temperature range varies depending on the types of hydrocarbons in the formation. The pyrolysis temperature range may include temperatures between 250 °C and 900 °C. The pyrolysis temperature range for producing desired products may extend through only a portion of the total pyrolysis temperature range. In some embodiments, the pyrolysis temperature .range for producing desired products may include temperatures between 250 °C and 400 °C or temperatures between 270 °C and 350 °C. If a temperature of hydrocarbons in the formation is slowly raised through the temperature range from 250 °C to 400 °C, production of pyrolysis products may be substantially complete when the temperature approaches 400 °C. Average temperature of the hydrocarbons may be raised at a rate of less than 5 °C per day, less than 2 °C per day, less than 1 °C per day, or less than 0.5 °C per day through the pyrolysis temperature range for producing desired products. Heating the hydrocarbon containing<br><br>
r   ,uTofhfeti
The rate of temperature increase through the pyrolysis temperature range for desired products may affect the quality and quantity of the formation fluids produced from the hydrocarbon containing formation. Raising the temperature slowly through the pyrolysis temperature range for desired products may inhibit mobilization of large    ' chain molecules in the formation. Raising the temperature slowly through the pyrolysis temperature range for desired products may limit reactions between mobilized hydrocarbons that produce undesired products. Slowly raising the temperature of the formation through the pyrolysis temperature range for desired products may allow for the production of high quality, high API gravity hydrocarbons from the formation. Slowly raising the temperature of the formation through the pyrolysis temperature range for desired products may allow for the removal of a large amount of the hydrocarbons present in the formation as hydrocarbon product<br>
In some in situ conversion embodiments, a portion of die formation is heated to a desired temperature instead of slowly heating the temperature through a temperature range. In some embodiments, the desired temperature is 300 °C, 325 °C, or 350 °C. Other temperatures may be selected as the desired temperature. Superposition of heat from heat sources allows the desired temperature to be relatively quickly and efficiently established in the formation. Energy input into the formation from the heat sources may be adjusted to maintain the temperature in the formation substantially at the desired temperature. The heated portion of the formation is maintained substantially at the desired temperature until pyrolysis declines such that production of desired formation fluids from the formation becomes uneconomical. Parts of the formation that are subjected to pyrolysis may include regions brought into a pyrolysis temperature range by heat transfer from only one heat source.<br>
In certain embodiments, formation fluids including pyrolyzation fluids are produced from the formation. As the temperature of the formation increases, the amount of condensable hydrocarbons in the produced formation fluid may decrease. At high temperatures, the formation may produce mostly methane and/or hydrogen. If the hydrocarbon containing formation is heated throughout the entire pyrolysis range, the formation may produce only small amounts of hydrogen towards an upper limit of the pyrolysis range. After all of the available hydrogen is depleted, a minimal amount of fluid production from the formation will typically occur.<br>
After pyrolysis of hydrocarbons, a large amount of carbon and some hydrogen may still be present in the formation. A significant portion of carbon remaining in the formation can be produced from the formation in the form of synthesis gas. Synthesis gas generation may take place during stage 3 heating depicted in FIG. 1. Stage 3 may include heating a hydrocarbon containing formation to a temperature sufficient to allow synthesis gas generation. For example, synthesis gas may be produced in a temperature range from about 400 °C to about 1200 °C, about 500 °C to about 1100 °C, or about 550 °C to about 1000 °C. The temperature of the heated portion of the formation when the synthesis gas generating fluid is introduced to the formation determines the composition of synthesis gas produced in the formation. The generated synthesis gas may be removed from the formation through a production well or production wells.<br>
Total energy content of fluids produced from the hydrocarbon containing formation may stay relatively constant throughout pyrolysis and synthesis gas generatioa During pyrolysis at relatively low formation temperatures, a significant portion of the produced fluid may be condensable hydrocarbons that have a high energy content At higher pyrolysis temperatures, however, less of the formation fluid may include condensable hydrocarbons. More non-condensable formation fluids may be produced from the formation. Energy content per unit volume of the produced fluid may decline slightly during generation of predominantly non-condensable<br><br>
^bfn^tid|flMdSH)firiJ^ s$aA&amp;a£f&amp;* generation, energy content per unit volume of produced synthesis gas declines significantly compared to energy content of pyrolyzation fluid. The volume of the produced synthesis gas, however, will in many instances increase substantially, thereby compensating for the decreased energy content<br>
FIG. 2 depicts a schematic view of an embodiment of a portion of the in situ conversion system for treating a hydrocarbon containing formation. The in situ conversion system may include barrier wells 208. Bairier wells 208 are used to form a barrier around a treatment area. The barrier inhibits fluid flow into and/or out of the treatment area. Barrier wells include, but are not limited to, dewatering wells, vacuum wells, capture wells, injection wells, grout wells, freeze wells, or combinations thereof. In the embodiment depicted in FIG. 2, barrier wells 208 are shown extending only along one side of heat sources 210, but the barrier wells typically encircle all heat sources 210 used, or to be used, to heat a treatment area of the formation.<br>
Heat sources 210 are placed in at least a portion of the formation. Heat sources 210 may include heaters such as insulated conductors, conductor-in-conduit heaters, surface burners, flameless distributed conibustors, and/or natural distributed combustors. Heat sources 210 may also include other types of heaters. Heat sources 210 provide heat to at least a portion of the formation to heat hydrocarbons in the formation. Energy may be supplied to heat sources 210 through supply lines 212. Supply lines 212 may be structurally different depending on the type of heat source or heat sources used to heat the formation. Supply lines 212 for heat sources may transmit electricity for electric heaters, may transport fuel for combustors, or may transport heat exchange fluid that is circulated in the formation.<br>
Production wells 214 are used to remove formation fluid from the formation. In some embodiments, production well 214 may include one or more heat sources. A heat source in the production well may heat one or more portions of the formation at or near the production welL A heat source in a production well may inhibit condensation and reflux of formation fluid being removed from the formation.<br>
Formation fluid produced from production wells 214 may be transported through collection piping 216 to treatment facilities 218. Formation fluids may also be produced fromheat sources 210. For example, fluid may be produced from heat sources 210 to control pressure in the formation adjacent to the heat sources. Fluid produced from heat sources 210 may be transported through tubing or piping to collection piping 216 or the produced fluid may be transported through tubing or piping directly to treatment facilities 218. Treatment facilities 218 may include separation units, reaction units, upgrading units, fuel cells, turbines, storage vessels, and/or other systems and units for processing produced formation fluids. The treatment facilities may form transportation fuel from at least a portion of the hydrocarbons produced from the formation.<br>
In some in situ conversion process embodiments, a circulation system is used to heat the formation. The circulation system may be a closed loop circulation system. FIG. 3 depicts a schematic representation of a system for heating a formation using a circulation system. The system may be used to heat hydrocarbons that are relatively deep in the ground and that are in formations that are relatively large in extent In some embodiments, the hydrocarbons may be 100 m, 200 m, 300 m or more below the surface. The circulation system may also be used to heat hydrocarbons that are not as deep in the ground. The hydrocarbons may be in formations that extend lengthwise up to 500 m, 750 m, 1000 m, or more. The circulation system may become economically viable in formations where the length of the hydrocarbon containing formation to be treated is long compared to the thickness of the overburden. The ratio of the hydrocarbon formation extent to be heated by heaters to the overburden thickness may be at least 3, at least 5, or at least 10. The heaters of the circulation system may be positioned relative to adjacent heaters so that<br><br>
nuf&gt;efpdSltft&amp;WMdi be!hvgfen^tef&amp; of the circulation system allows the temperature of the formation to be raised at least above the boiling point of aqueous formation fluid in the formation.<br>
In some embodiments, heaters 220 may be formed in the formation by drilling a first wellbore and then drilling a second wellbore that connects with the first wellbore. Piping may be positioned in the U-shaped wellbore to form U-shaped heater 220. Heaters 220 are connected to heat transfer fluid circulation system 222 by piping. Gas at high pressure may be used as the heat transfer fluid in the closed loop circulation system. In some embodiments, the.heat transfer fluid is carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is chemically stable at the required temperatures and pressures and has a relatively high molecular weight that results in a high volumetric heat capacity. Other fluids such as steam, air, helium and/or nitrogen may also be used. The pressure of die heat transfer fluid entering the formation may be 3000 kPa or higher. The use of high pressure heat transfer fluid allows the heat transfer fluid to have a greater density, and therefore a greater capacity to transfer heat Also, the pressure drop across the heaters is less for a system where the heat transfer fluid enters die heaters at a first pressure for a given mass flow rate than when the heat transfer fluid enters the heaters at a second pressure at die same mass flow rate when the first pressure is greater than the second pressure.<br>
Heat transfer fluid circulation system 222 may include heat supply 224, first heat exchanger 226, second heat exchanger 228, and compressor 230. Heat supply 224 heats die beat transfer fluid to a high temperature. Heat supply 224 may be a furnace, solar collector, reactor, fuel cell exhaust heat, or other high temperature source able to supply heat to the heat transfer fluid. In the embodiment depicted in FIG. 3, heat supply 224 is a furnace that heats the heat transfer fluid to a temperature in a range from about 700 °C to about 920 °C, from about 770 °C to about 870 °C, or from about 800 °C to about 850 °C. In an embodiment, heat supply 224 heats the heat transfer fluid to a temperature of about 820 °C. The heat transfer fluid flows from heat supply 224 to heaters 220. Heat transfers from heaters 220 to formation 232 adjacent to the heaters. The temperature of the heat transfer fluid exiting formation 232 may be in a range from about 350 °C to about 580 °C, from about 400 °C to about 530 °C, or from about 450 °C to about 500 °C. In an embodiment, the temperature of the heat transfer fluid exiting formation 232 is about 480 °C. The metallurgy of the piping used to form heat transfer fluid circulation system 222 may be varied to significantly reduce costs of the piping. High temperature steel may be used from furnace 224 to a point where the temperature is sufficiently low so that less expensive steel can be used from that point to first heat exchanger 226. Several different steel grades may be used to form the piping of heat transfer fluid circulation system 222.<br>
Heat transfer fluid from heat supply 224 of heat transfer fluid circulation system 222 passes through overburden 234 of formation 232 to hydrocarbon layer 236. Portions of heaters 220 extending through overburden 234 may be insulated. In some embodiments, the insulation or part of the insulation is a polyimide insulating material. Inlet portions of heaters 220 in hydrocarbon layer 236 may have tapering insulation to reduce overheating of the hydrocarbon layer near the inlet of the heater into the hydrocarbon layer.<br>
In some embodiments, the diameter of the pipe in overburden 234 may be smaller than the diameter of pipe through hydrocarbon layer 236. The smaller diameter pipe through overburden 234 may allow for less heat transfer to die overburden. Reducing the amount of heat transfer to overburden 234 reduces the amount of cooling of die heat transfer fluid supplied to pipe adjacent to hydrocarbon layer 236. The increased heat transfer in the smaller diameter pipe due to increased velocity of heat transfer fluid through the small diameter pipe is offset by the smaller surface area of the smaller diameter pipe and the decrease in residence time of the heat transfer fluid in the smaller diameter pipe.<br><br>
m » *   ""Kf&amp;tSMng 10HriiAf£cC fee heat transfer fluid passes through first heat exchanger 226 and second heat exchanger 228 to compressor 230. First heat exchanger 226 transfers heat between heat transfer fluid exiting formation 232 and heat transfer fluid exiting compressor 230 to raise the temperature of the heat transfer fluid that enters heat supply 224 and reduce the temperature of the fluid exiting formation 232. Second heat exchanger 228 further reduces the temperature of fee heat transfer fluid before fee heat transfer fluid enters compressor 230.<br>

Heat transfer fluid entries 238 into formation 232 alternate wife heat transfer fluid exits 240. Alternating heat transfer fluid entries 238 wife heat transfer fluid exits 240 may allow for more uniform heating of die hydrocarbons in formation 232.<br>
The circulation system may be used to heat a portion of fee formation. Production wells in the formation are used to remove produced fluids. After production from the formation has ended, the circulation system may be used to recover heat from fee formation. Heat transfer fluid may be circulated through heaters 220 after heat supply 224 (depicted in FIG. 3) is disconnected from the circulation system. The beat transfer fluid may be a different heat transfer fluid than the heat transfer fluid used to heat the formation. Heat transfers from fee heated formation to the ■ heat transfer fluid. The heat transfer fluid may be used to heat another portion of the formation or fee heat transfer fluid may be used for other purposes. In some embodiments, water is introduced into heaters 220 to produce steam, hi some embodiments, low temperature steam is introduced into heaters 220 so feat the passage of fee steam through fee heaters increases fee temperature of fee steam. Other heat transfer fluids including natural or synthetic oils, such as Syltherm oil (Dow Corning Corporation (Midland, Michigan, U.S.A.), may be used instead of steam or water.<br>
In some embodiments, fee circulation system may be used in conjunction with electrical heating. In some embodiments, at least a portion of fee pipe in the U-shaped wellbores adjacent to portions of the formation feat are to be heated is made of a ferromagnetic material. For example, die piping adjacent to a layer or layers of the formation to be heated is made of a 9% to 13% chromium steel, such as 410 stainless steel. The pipe may be a temperature limited heater when time varying electric current is applied to the piping. The time varying electric current may resistively heat the piping, which heats fee formation. In some embodiments, direct electric current may be used to resistively heat the piping, which heats the formation.<br>
In some embodiments, fee circulation system is used to heat the formation to a first temperature, and electrical energy is used to maintain fee temperature of fee formation and/or heat fee formation to higher temperatures. The first temperature may be sufficient to vaporize aqueous formation fluid in fee formation. The first temperature may be at most about 200 °C, at most about 300 °C, at most about 350 °C, or at most about 400 °C. Using fee circulation system to beat fee formation to the first temperature allows fee formation to be dry when electricity is used to heat the formation. Heating the dry formation may minimize electrical current leakage into the formation.<br>
In some embodiments, the circulation system and electrical heating may be used to heat fee formation to a first temperature. The formation may be maintained, or the temperature of the formation may be increased from the first temperature, using fee circulation system and/or electrical heating. In some embodiments, fee formation may be raised to fee first temperature using electrical heating, and the temperature may be maintained and/or increased using fee circulation system. Economic factors, available electricity, availability of fuel for heating the heat transfer fluid, and other factors may be used to determine when electrical heating and/or circulation system heating are to be used.<br>
In certain embodiments, the portion of heater 220 in hydrocarbon layer 236 is coupled to lead-in conductors. Lead-in conductors may be located in overburden 234. Lead-in conductors may electrically couple the<br><br>
"pofti&amp;n dfhe&amp;M &amp;Qrhtby3fo8aMuftaycr 236 to one or more wellheads at the surface. Electrical isolators may be located at a junction of the portion of heater 220 in hydrocarbon layer 236 with portions of heater 220 in overburden 234 so that the portions of the heater in die overburden are electrically isolated from the portion of the heater in the hydrocarbon layer, hi some embodiments, the lead-in conductors are placed inside of the pipe of the closed loop circulation system. In some embodiments, the lead-in conductors are positioned outside of the pipe of the closed loop circulation system. In some embodiments, the lead-in conductors are insulated conductors with mineral insulation, such as magnesium oxide. The lead-in conductors may include highly electrically conductive materials such as copper or aluminum to reduce heat losses in overburden 234 during electrical heating.<br>
In certain embodiments, the portions of heater 220 in overburden 234 may be used as lead-in conductors. The portions of heater 220 in overburden 234 may be electrically coupled to the portion of heater 220 in hydrocarbon layer 236. In some embodiments, one or more electrically conducting materials (such as copper or aluminum) are coupled (for example, cladded or welded) to the portions of heater 220 in overburden 234 to reduce the electrical resistance of the portions of the heater in the overburden. Reducing the electrical resistance of the portions of heater 220 in overburden 234 reduces heat losses in the overburden during electrical heating.<br>
In some embodiments, the portion of heater 220 in hydrocarbon layer 236 is a temperature limited heater with a self-limiting temperature between about 600 °C and about 1000 °C. The portion of heater 220 in hydrocarbon layer 236 may be a 9% to 13% chromium stainless steel. For example, portion of heater 220 in hydrocarbon layer 236 may be 410 stainless steel. Time-varying current may be applied to the portion of heater 220 in hydrocarbon layer 236 so that the heater operates as a temperature limited heater.<br>
FIG. 5 depicts a side view representation of an embodiment of a system for heating a portion of a formation using a circulated fluid system and/or electrical heating. Wellheads 242 of heaters 220 may be coupled to heat transfer fluid circulation system 222 by piping. Wellheads 242 may also be coupled to electrical power supply system 244. In some embodiments, heat transfer fluid circulation system 222 is disconnected from the heaters when electrical power is used to heat the formation. In some embodiments, electrical power supply system 244 is disconnected from the heaters when heat transfer fluid circulation system 222 is used to heat the formation.<br>
Electrical power supply system 244 may include transformer 246 and cables 248,250. In certain embodiments, cables 248,250 are capable of carrying high currents with low losses. For example, cables 248,250 may be thick copper or aluminum conductors. The cables may also have thick insulation layers. In some embodiments, cable 248 and/or cable 250 may be superconducting cables. The superconducting cables may be cooled by liquid nitrogen. Superconducting cables are available from Superpower, Inc. (Schenectady, New York, U.S.A.). Superconducting cables may minimize power loss and/or reduce the size of the cables needed to couple transformer 246 to the heaters.<br>
Temperature limited heaters may be in configurations and/or may include materials that provide automatic temperature limiting properties for the heater at certain temperatures. In certain embodiments, ferromagnetic materials are used in temperature limited heaters. Ferromagnetic material may self-limit temperature at or near the Curie temperature of the material to provide a reduced amount of heat at or near the Curie temperature when a time-varying current is applied to the material In certain embodiments, the ferromagnetic material self-limits temperature of the temperature limited heater at a selected temperature that is approximately the Curie temperature. In certain embodiments, the selected temperature is within 35 °C, within 25 °C, within 20 °C, or within 10 °C of the Curie temperature. In certain embodiments, ferromagnetic materials are coupled with other materials (for example, highly conductive materials, high strength materials, corrosion resistant materials, or combinations thereof) to provide<br><br>
""Vafidus <bfe some parts of the tenyerature limited heater may have a lower></bfe>
resistance (caused by different geometries and/or by using different ferromagnetic and/or non-ferromagnetic materials) than other parts of the temperature limited heater. Having parts of the temperature limited heater with various materials and/or dimensions allows for tailoring the desired heat output from each part of the heater.<br>
Temperature limited heaters may be more reliable than other heaters. Temperature limited heaters may be less apt to break down or fail due to hot spots in the formation. In some embodiments, temperature limited heaters allow for substantially uniform heating of the formation. In some embodiments, temperature limited heaters are able to heat the formation more efficiently by operating at a higher average heat output along the entire length of the heater. The temperature limited heater operates at the higher average heat output along the entire length of the heater because power to the heater does not have to be reduced to the entire heater, as is the case with typical constant wattage heaters, if a temperature along any point of the heater exceeds, or is to exceed, a maximum operating temperature of the heater. Heat output from portions of a temperature limited heater approaching a Curie temperature of the heater automatically reduces without controlled adjustment of the time-varying current applied to the heater. The heat output automatically reduces due to changes in electrical properties (for example, electrical resistance) of portions of the temperature limited heater. Thus, more power is supplied by the temperature limited heater during a greater portion of a heating process.<br>
In certain embodiments, the system including temperature limited heaters initially provides a first heat output and then provides a reduced (second heat output) heat output, near, at, or above the Curie temperature of an electrically resistive portion of the heater when the temperature limited heater is energized by a time-varying current. The first heat output is the heat output at temperatures below which the temperature limited heater begins to self-limit In some embodiments, the first heat output is the heat output at a temperature 50 °C, 75 °C, 100 °C, or 125 6C below the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic material in the temperature limited heater.<br>
The temperature limited heater may be energized by time-varying current (alternating current or modulated direct current) supplied at the wellhead. The wellhead may include a power source and other components (for example, modulation components, transformers, and/or capacitors) used in supplying power to the temperature limited heater. The temperature limited heater may be one of many heaters used to heat a portion of the formation.<br>
In certain embodiments, the temperature limited heater includes a conductor that operates as a skin effect or proximity effect heater when time-varying current is applied to the conductor. The skin effect limits the depth of current penetration into the interior of the conductor. For ferromagnetic materials, the skin effect is dominated by die magnetic permeability of the conductor. The relative magnetic permeability of ferromagnetic materials is typically between 10 and 1000 (for example, die relative magnetic permeability of ferromagnetic materials is typically at least 10 and may be at least 50, 100, 500,1000 or greater). As the temperature of the ferromagnetic material is raised above the Curie temperature and/or as the applied electrical current is increased, the magnetic permeability of the ferromagnetic material decreases substantially and the skin depth expands rapidly (for example, the skin depth expands as the inverse square root of the magnetic permeability). The reduction in magnetic permeability results in a decrease in the AC or modulated DC resistance of the conductor near, at, or above the Curie temperature and/or as the applied electrical current is increased. When the temperature limited heater is powered by a substantially constant current source, portions of the heater that approach, reach, or are above the Curie temperature may have reduced heat dissipation. Sections of the temperature limited heater that are not at or near the Curie temperature may be dominated by skin effect heating that allows die heater to have high heat dissipation due to a higher resistive load.<br><br>
t<br>
"ASC'WiEkgetKf tSiife te^mperature limited heater to heat hydrocarbons in the formation is that the conductor is chosen to have a Curie temperature in a desired range of temperature operation. Operation within the desired operating temperature range allows substantial heat injection into the formation while maintaining the temperature of the temperature limited heater, and other equipment, below design limit temperatures. Design limit temperatures are temperatures at which properties such as corrosion, creep, and/or deformation are adversely affected. The temperature limiting properties of the temperature limited heater inhibits overheating or burnout of the heater adjacent to low thermal conductivity "hot spots" in the formation. In some embodiments, the temperature limited heater is able to lower or control heat output and/or withstand heat at temperatures above 25 °C, 37 °C, 100 °C, 250 °C, 500 °C, 700 °C, 800 °C, 900 °C, or higher up to 1131 °C, depending on the materials used in die heater.<br>
The temperature limited heater allows for more heat injection into the formation than constant wattage heaters because the energy input into the temperature limited heater does not have to be limited to accommodate low thermal conductivity regions adjacent to the heater. For example, in Green River oil shale there is a difference of at least a factor of 3 in the thermal conductivity of the lowest richness oil shale layers and the highest richness oil shale layers. When heating such a formation, substantially more heat is transferred to the formation with the temperature limited heater than with the conventional heater that is limited by the temperature at low thermal conductivity layers. The heat output along the entire length of the conventional heater needs to accommodate the low thermal conductivity layers so that the heater does not overheat at the low thermal conductivity layers and burn out The heat output adjacent to die low thermal conductivity layers that are at high temperature will reduce for the temperature limited heater, but die remaining portions of the temperature limited heater that are not at high temperature will still provide high heat output Because heaters for heating hydrocarbon formations typically have long lengths (for example, at least 10 m, 100 m, 300 m, at least 500 m, 1 km or more up to 10 km), the majority of the length of the temperature limited heater may be operating below the Curie temperature while only a few portions are at or near the Curie temperature of the temperature limited heater.<br>
The use of temperature limited heaters allows for efficient transfer of heat to the formation. Efficient transfer of heat allows for reduction in time needed to heat the formation to a desired temperature. For the same heater spacing, temperature limited heaters may allow a larger average heat output while maintaining heater equipment temperatures below equipment design limit temperatures. Pyrolysis in the formation may occur at an earlier time with the larger average heat output provided by temperature limited heaters than the lower average heat output provided by constant wattage heaters. Temperature limited heaters counteract hot spots due to inaccurate well spacing or drilling where heater wells come too close together. In certain embodiments, temperature limited heaters allow for increased power output over time for heater wells that have been spaced too far apart, or limit power output for heater wells that are spaced too close together. Temperature limited heaters also supply more power in regions adjacent the overburden and underbidden to compensate for temperature losses in these regions.<br>
Temperature limited heaters may be advantageously used in many types of formations. For example, in tar sands formations or relatively permeable formations containing heavy hydrocarbons, temperature limited heaters may be used to provide a controllable low temperature output for reducing the viscosity of fluids, mobilizing fluids, and/or enhancing the radial flow of fluids at or near the wellbore or in die formation. Temperature limited heaters may be used to inhibit excess coke formation due to overheating of the near wellbore region of the formation.<br>
The use of temperature limited heaters, in some embodiments, eliminates or reduces the need for expensive temperature control circuitry. For example, the use of temperature limited heaters eliminates or reduces the need to<br><br>
perform M^eM©elog|i^l^6^&amp; need to use fixed thermocouples on the heaters to monitor potential overheating at hot spots.<br>
The ferromagnetic alloy or ferromagnetic alloys used in the temperature limited heater determine the Curie temperature of the heater. Ferromagnetic conductors may include one or more of the ferromagnetic elements (iron, cobalt, and nickel) and/or alloys of these elements, hi some embodiments, ferromagnetic conductors include iron-chromium (Fe-Cr) alloys that contain tungsten (W) (for exanyle, HCM12A and SAVE12 (Sumitomo Metals Co., Japan) and/or iron alloys that contain chromium (for example, Fe-Cr alloys, Fe-Cr-W alloys, Fe-Cr-V (vanadium) alloys, Fe-Cr-Nb (Niobium) alloys). Of the three main ferromagnetic elements, iron has a Curie temperature of 770 °C; cobalt (Co) has a Curie temperature of 1131 °C; and nickel has a Curie temperature of approximately 358 °C. An iron-cobalt alloy has a Curie temperature higher than the Curie temperature of iron. For example, iron-cobalt alloy with 2% by weight cobalt has a Curie temperature of 800 °C; iron-cobalt alloy with 12% by weight cobalt has a Curie temperature of 900 °C; and iron-cobalt alloy with 20% by weight cobalt has a Curie temperature of 950 °C. Iron-nickel alloy has a Curie temperature lower than the Curie temperature of iron. For example, iron-nickel alloy with 20% by weight nickel has a Curie temperature of 720 °C, and iron-nickel alloy with 60% by weight nickel has a Curie temperature of 560 °C<br>
Some non-ferromagnetic elements raise the Curie temperature of iron. For example, an iron-vanadium alloy with 5.9% by weight vanadium has a Curie temperature of approximately 815 °C. Other non-ferromagnetic elements (for example, carbon, aluminum, copper, silicon, and/or chromium) may be alloyed with iron or other ferromagnetic materials to lower the Curie temperature. Non-ferromagnetic materials that raise the Curie temperature may be combined with non-ferromagnetic materials that lower the Curie temperature and alloyed with iron or other ferromagnetic materials to produce a material with a desired Curie temperature and other desired physical and/or chemical properties. In some embodiments, the Curie temperature material is a ferrite such as NiFe204. In other embodiments, the Curie temperature material is a binary compound such as FeNi3 or FejAL<br>
Certain embodiments of temperature limited heaters may include more than one ferromagnetic material Such embodiments are within the scope of embodiments described herein if any conditions described herein apply to -at least one of the ferromagnetic materials in the temperature limited heater.<br>
Ferromagnetic properties generally decay as die Curie temperature is approached. The self-limiting temperature may be somewhat below the actual Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor. The skin depth for current flow in 1% carbon steel is 0.132 cm at room temperature and increases to 0.445 cm at 720 °C. From 720 °C to 730 °C, the skin depth sharply increases to over 2.5 cm. Thus, a temperature limited heater embodiment using 1% carbon steel begins to self-limit between 650 °C and 730 °C.<br>
Skin depth generally defines an effective penetration depth of time-varying current into the conductive material. In general, current density decreases exponentially with distance from an outer surface to the center along the radius of the conductor. The depth at which the current density is approximately lie of the surface current density is called the skin depth. For a solid cylindrical rod with a diameter much greater than the penetration depth, or for hollow cylinders with a wall thickness exceeding the penetration depth, the skin depth, 5, is:<br>

Materials used in the temperature limited heater may be selected to provide a desired turndown ratio. Turndown ratios of at least 1.1:1,2:1,3:1,4:1,5:1,10:1,30:1, or 50:1 may be selected for temperature limited heaters. Larger turndown ratios may also be used A selected turndown ratio may depend on a number of factors including, but not limited to, the type of formation in which the temperature limited heater is located (for example, a higher turndown ratio may be used for an oil shale formation with large variations in thermal conductivity between rich and lean oil shale layers) and/or a temperature limit of materials used in the wellbore (for example, temperature limits of heater materials). In some embodiments, the turndown ratio is increased by coupling additional copper or another good electrical conductor to the ferromagnetic material (for example, adding copper to lower the resistance above the Curie temperature).<br>
The temperature limited heater may provide a minimum heat output (power output) below the Curie temperature of the heater. In certain embodiments, the minimum heat output is at least 400 W/m (Watts per meter), 600 W/m, 700 W/m, 800 W/m, or higher up to 2000 W/m. The temperature limited heater reduces the amount of heat output by a section of the heater when the temperature of the section of the heater approaches oris above the Curie temperature. The reduced amount of heat may be substantially less than the heat output below the Curie temperature. In some embodiments, the reduced amount of heat is at most 400 W/m, 200 W/m, 100 W/m or may approach 0 W/m.<br>
In some embodiments, AC frequency is adjusted to change the skin depth of the ferromagnetic material. For example, the skin depth of 1% carbon steel at room temperature is 0.132 cm at 60 Hz, 0.0762 cm at 180 Hz, and 0.046 cm at 440 Hz. Since heater diameter is typically larger than twice the skin depth, using a higher frequency (and thus a heater with a smaller diameter) reduces heater costs. For a fixed geometry, the higher frequency results -in a higher turndown ratio. The turndown ratio at a higher frequency is calculated by multiplying the turndown ratio at a lower frequency by the square root of the higher frequency divided by the lower frequency. In some embodiments, a frequency between 100 Hz and 1000 Hz, between 140 Hz and 200 Hz, or between 400 Hz and 600 Hz is used (for example, 180 Hz, 540 Hz, or 720 Hz). In some embodiments, high frequencies may be used. The frequencies may be greater than 1000 Hz.<br>
In certain embodiments, modulated DC (for example, chopped DC, waveform modulated DC, or cycled DC) may be used for providing electrical power to the temperature limited heater. A DC modulator or DC chopper may be coupled to a DC power supply to provide an output of modulated direct current In some embodiments, the DC power supply may include means for modulating DC. One example of a DC modulator is a DC-to-DC converter system. DC-to-DC converter systems are generally known in the art DC is typically modulated or chopped into a desired waveform. Waveforms for DC modulation include, but are not limited to, square-wave, sinusoidal, deformed sinusoidal, deformed square-wave, triangular, and other regular or irregular waveforms.<br>
The modulated DC waveform generally defines the frequency of the modulated DC. Thus, the modulated<br>
DC waveform may be selected to provide a desired modulated DC frequency. The shape and/or the rate of<br>
■<br>
modulation (such as the rate of chopping) of the modulated DC waveform may be varied to vary the modulated DC frequency. DC may be modulated at frequencies that are higher than generally available AC frequencies. For<br><br>
^a£aplc^M}MMJiCM^'i^frbvSHed at frequencies of at least 1000 Hz. Increasing Hie frequency of supplied<br>
current to higher values advantageously increases the turndown ratio of the temperature limited heater.	/<br>
In certain embodiments, the modulated DC waveform is adjusted or altered to vary the modulated DC frequency. The DC modulator may be able to adjust or alter the modulated DC waveform at any time during use of the temperature limited heater and at high currents or voltages. Thus, modulated DC provided to the temperature limited heater is not limited to a single frequency or even a small set of frequency values. Waveform selection using the DC modulator typically allows for a wide range of modulated DC frequencies and for discrete control of the modulated DC frequency. Thus, the modulated DC frequency is more easily set at a distinct value whereas AC frequency is generally limited to multiples of the line frequency. Discrete control of the modulated DC frequency allows for more selective control over the turndown ratio of the temperature limited heater. Being able to selectively control the turndown ratio of the temperature limited heater allows for a broader range of materials to be used in designing and constructing the temperature limited heater.<br>
In some embodiments, the modulated DC frequency or the AC frequency is adjusted to compensate for changes in properties (for example, subsurface conditions such as temperature or pressure) of the temperature limited heater during use. The modulated DC frequency or the AC frequency provided to the temperature limited heater is varied based on assessed downhole conditions. For example, as the temperature of die temperature limited heater in the wellbore increases, it may be advantageous to increase the frequency of the current provided to die beater; thus increasing the turndown ratio of the heater. In an embodiment, the downhole temperature of the temperature limited heater in the wellbore is assessed<br>
In certain embodiments, the modulated DC frequency, or the AC frequency, is varied to adjust die turndown ratio of the temperature limited heater. The turndown ratio may be adjusted to compensate for hot spots occurring along a length of the temperature limited heater. For example, the turndown ratio is increased because the temperature limited heater is getting too hot in certain locations. In some embodiments, die modulated DC frequency, or the AC frequency, are varied to adjust a turndown ratio without assessing a subsurface condition.<br>
In some embodiments circulation system embodiments, the portion of die piping that is adjacent to portions of the formation that are to be heated is a 9% to 13% chromium stainless steel, such as 410 stainless steel, because of the properties of die material 410 stainless steel piping is relatively inexpensive and readily available. 410 stainless steel is a ferromagnetic material, so the piping will be a temperature limited heater if a time varying current is applied to die piping to resistively heat the piping. Also, the sulfidation rate of 410 stainless steel is relatively low, and the rate decreases with increasing temperature at least in the temperature range from about 530 °C to 6S0 °C. The sulfidation characteristics make 410 stainless steel a good material for use with in situ conversion processes.<br>
FIG, 6 depicts data of electrical resistance (m&amp;) versus temperature (°C) for a solid 2.54 cm diameter, 1.8 m long 410 stainless steel rod at various applied electrical currents. Curves 252,254,256,258, and 260 depict resistance profiles as a function of temperature for die 410 stainless steel rod at 40 amps AC (curve 258), 70 amps AC (curve 260), 140 amps AC (curve 252), 230 amps AC (curve 254), and 10 amps DC (curve 256). For the applied AC currents of 140 amps and 230 amps, the resistance increased gradually with increasing temperature until die Curie temperature was reached. At the Curie temperature, the resistance fell sharply. In contrast, the resistance showed a gradual increase with temperature tiurough the Curie temperature for the applied DC current<br>

where 5 is the skin depth, R1 is the radius of the cylinder, RAC is the AC resistance, and Roc is the DC resistance. In FIG. 7, curves 262-282 show skin depth profiles as a function of temperature for applied AC electrical currents over a range of 50 amps to 500 amps (262: 50 amps; 264:100 amps; 266:150 amps; 268:200 amps; 270:250 amps; 272: 300 amps; 274:350 amps; 278:400 amps; 280:450 amps; 282:500 amps). For each applied AC electrical current, the skin depth gradually increased with increasing temperature up to the Curie temperature. At the Curie temperature, the skin depth increased sharply.<br>
FIG. 8 depicts temperature (°C) versus log time (hrs) data for a 2.5 cm solid 410 stainless steel rod and a 2.5 cm solid 304 stainless steel rod. At a constant applied AC electrical current, die temperature of each rod increased with time. Curve 284 shows data for a thermocouple placed on an outer surface of the 304 stainless steel rod and under a layer of insulation. Curve 286 shows data for a thermocouple placed on an outer surface of the 304 stainless steel rod without a layer of insulation. Curve 288 shows data for a thermocouple placed on an outer surface of the 410 stainless steel rod and under a layer of insulation. Curve 290 shows data for a thermocouple placed on an outer surface of the 410 stainless steel rod without a layer of insulation. A comparison of the curves shows that the temperature of the 304 stainless steel rod (curves 284 and 286) increased more rapidly than the temperature of the 410 stainless steel rod (curves 288 and 290). The temperature of the 304 stainless steel rod (curves 284 and 286) also reached a higher value than the temperature of die 410 stainless steel rod (curves 288 and 290). The temperature difference between the non-insulated section of die 410 stainless steel rod (curve 290) and the insulated section of the 410 stainless steel rod (curve 288) was less than the temperature difference between the non-insulated section of the 304 stainless steel rod (curve 286) and the insulated section of die 304 stainless steel rod (curve 284). The temperature of the 304 stainless steel rod was increasing at the termination of the experiment (curves 284 and 286) while the temperature of the 410 stainless steel rod had leveled out (curves 288 and 290). Thus, the 410 stainless steel rod (the temperature limited heater) provided better temperature control than die 304 stainless steel rod (the non-temperature limited heater) in the presence of varying thermal loads (due to the insulation).<br>
