				<td>I.	FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to fluid delivery systems, and more particularly, to<br>
precision fluid delivery systems for use in cosmetic surgical procedures where rapid and<br>
precise delivery of relatively large volumes of sterile fluid is required.<br>
II. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In general surgical procedures frequently involve the loss of significant quantities<br>
of blood and other bodily fluids, which must be replaced for recovery and healing. Crude<br>
procedures or "rules of thumb" have been developed for estimating fluid loss and the<br>
amount and nature of fluids prescribed for replacement. Generally, these fluids, such as<br>
blood or plasma, are delivered intravenously to the patient during the operation and post<br>
operative care. The fluid is delivered by gravity from an elevated reservoir through a tube<br>
and implanted needle. These "drip" systems are deliberately designed to deliver the fluid<br>
slowly to the patient. Markings indicating volume corresponding to the level of fluid in<br>
the reservoir (e.g., a transparent or translucent, plastic "bag") are used to estimate the<br>
amount of liquid administered to the patient.<br>
Cosmetic surgery often requires the administration of fluids into a patient for other<br>
reasons. As used herein "cosmetic surgery" refers to invasive procedures that are used, at<br>
least in part to directly improve the appearance of a patient. For example, lipoplasty<br>
involves the removal of excess fatty tissue to improve the appearance and often the health<br>
of the patient. During lipoplasty fatty tissue is preferably separated from the remaining<br>
tissue with the assistance of an ultrasonic surgical instrument, and the separated fatty<br>
tissue is periodically removed from the patient by aspiration. A saline "wetting" solution<br>
is injected into the patient's fatty tissues at various times during the procedure both to<br>
assist in flushing the separated tissue from adjacent tissue and to mitigate damage to<br>
adjacent tissue from operation of the ultrasonic device. The wetting solution may contain<br>
drug additives such as epinephrine for vasoconstriction or lidocaine for suppression of<br>
pain.<br><br>
Precision is important; the surgeon needs to know exactly how much fluid was<br>
inserted and exactly how much was taken out to properly perform any lipoplasty<br>
procedure. Precise volume information also helps to ensure symmetry and proportion<br>
where surgery is being conducted on adjacent body parts. To avoid prolonging the<br>
operation and to provide the desired final result, it is also highly desirable that the surgeon<br>
be able to deliver the fluid rapidly and in the precise amount to the body area being<br>
"sculpted."<br>
Similarly, cosmetic surgery frequently involves the insertion of devices, e.g.,<br>
plastic breast implants or temporary sizers, that are filled with sterile fluid to the desired<br>
amount. Again, it is highly desirable that the surgeon be able to insert the fluid rapidly in<br>
the precise volume. Standard procedures currently employed to fill implants and sizers<br>
use a syringe repeatedly to inject and monitor the appropriate amount of fluid. Such a<br>
process is inordinately slow<br>
Currently available fluid delivery systems are inadequate to achieve these<br>
objectives. "Drip" methods typically employed to administer drugs or deliver other fluids<br>
are too slow and imprecise for the foregoing types of surgery. Further, they do not<br>
develop sufficient pressure to infuse the fatty tissues with the wetting solution. Surgical<br>
operations of the type mentioned previously would be unduly prolonged and the patient<br>
subjected to undue trauma if "drip" systems were employed to deliver the fluids. Drip<br>
systems also do not provide precise information about the amount of fluid delivered to the<br>
patient. To provide greater precision, "in-line" systems have been designed in which a<br>
paddle wheel is imposed in the tubing conveying the fluid. An infrared device "counts"<br>
the rotations of the paddle wheel caused by passage of the fluid, and a computer integrates<br>
that information over time to extrapolate the volume of liquid dispensed. These systems<br>
lack the required accuracy. They also place a mechanical measurement device, i.e., the<br>
paddle wheel, in direct contact with the sterile fluid thereby presenting the prospect of<br>
undesirable contamination. Attempts have also been made to use an encoder-based<br>
counter to count revolutions of the motor that drives the heads of a peristaltic pump that<br>
delivers the fluid. A computer integrates the total revolutions and the estimated volume<br>
ejected per revolution in an effort to calculate the total volume of fluid delivered. These<br><br>
systems also do not provide the requisite precision, since there is a significant variation in<br>
accuracy across the speed range of the pump.<br>
Accordingly, there is a need for a fluid delivery system that will provide sterile<br>
fluids rapidly in precise volumes for use in medical procedures, especially those employed<br>
in cosmetic surgery.<br>
In particular it is an object of the present invention to provide a fluid delivery<br>
system for use in a surgical environment that has a precision of+/-1 ml over any volume<br>
from 10 ml to 5000 ml. In addition it is an object of the present invention to provide a<br>
fluid delivery system for use in a surgical environment that can rapidly deliver fluids at<br>
rates from 30 ml/min to 1000 ml/min. Such a system is particularly needed and suited for<br>
delivering wetting solution during lipoplasty and in the process of filling implanted or<br>
implantable breast implants.<br>
III. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has now been found that liquids, such as sterile fluids can be rapidly and<br>
precisely delivered to a patient or for the filling of implantable devices using the direct<br>
measurement of fluid weight and a pump and tubing set. The performance and accuracy<br>
are enhanced by using a positive displacement pump and by using a tubing set of a non-<br>
distensible material.<br>
It has been found that in one embodiment of the invention an acceptable system for<br>
delivering fluid in a surgical environment comprises: (1) a strain gauge sensor;<br>
(2) a container of fluid connected to the strain-gauge sensor so that the strain-gauge sensor<br>
will measure the weight of the container of fluid and generate an electrical output<br>
proportional to the weight of the fluid and container from time-to-time; (3) a pump system<br>
for pumping fluid from the container and having adjustable speed control for delivery of<br>
fluids within the range of 30 ml/min to 1000 ml/min; (4) a sterile tubing set connected to<br>
the fluid source and passing through the pump system and for delivery of the fluid to the<br>
surgical environment (i.e., a patient or implantable device); (5) a processor for processing<br><br>
the electrical output from the strain gauge from time-to-time to determine the amount of<br>
fluid delivered to the surgical environment; and (6) a display for displaying the amount of<br>
fluid delivered by the surgical device. Preferably, the tubing set is designed to eliminate<br>
distension under the pressure generated by the pump system to improve the accuracy of<br>
the system and the information displayed.<br>
Using this system and method, it is possible to obtain readings of+/-1 ml over any<br>
required volume of interest while delivering fluid at a rate of 30 to 1000 ml./min.<br>
IV. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic representation of one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
V. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
AND THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
This invention is directed to the rapid delivery of relatively large volumes of fluid<br>
in a very precise manner in a surgical environment. Volumes of fluid of interest are<br>
generally greater than 10 ml and may range as high as 3000 to 5000 ml depending on the<br>
anatomical site. For precise delivery of wetting solution to tissues of a patient during the<br>
course of liopoplasty, volumes of interest may range from 100 ml to 5000 ml. Infusion<br>
rates may be from 100 ml/min to around 600 ml/min, although faster or slower rates may<br>
be used. For the rapid and accurate filling of saline breast implants and sizers, volumes of<br>
interest are typically from 100 to 500 ml.<br>
It has now been discovered that a fluid delivery system can be provided capable of<br>
delivering fluid rapidly for surgical uses and having a measurement accuracy of<br>
approximately +/-1 ml over required volumes of interest. Such a system uses the precise<br>
measurement of the weight of a fluid source over time, i.e., as fluid is delivered from the<br>
source. This is far superior to methods in which the volume of fluid delivered is implied<br>
from indicia of fluid flow (as previously referenced) and integrated over time to obtain the<br>
total volume of fluid moved. The system of the invention may also employ a fluid<br>
pumping device that positively displaces fluids from the fluid source to the patient.<br><br>
Finally the system of the invention may also employ a tubing set for delivery of the fluid<br>
from the fluid source to the patient that is of sufficient integrity that the tubing does not<br>
distend appreciably under the pressure generated by the fluid pumping device. While the<br>
tubing should be flexible enough that it is connected easily to the equipment, it should not<br>
distend or expand appreciably. Thus, the weight loss measured by the strain gauge reflects<br>
movement of the fluid into the patient or implanted device, rather than an increase in the<br>
volume of fluid in the tubing set due to expansion of the tubing.<br>
In particular, it has been discovered that using a strain gauge to measure the weight<br>
(i.e., mass) of a bag of sterile fluid over time provides sufficient accuracy to measure the<br>
loss of fluid from the bag as required in surgical applications such as the cosmetic surgery<br>
procedures previously noted. Indeed, such a system has been able to obtain +/- 1 ml<br>
readings over any volume from 100 ml to 3000 ml. Strain gauges suitable for use in the<br>
present invention include devices with about a 10 pound limit and 5 volt excitation, such<br>
as the LC703-10, manufactured by Omega Engineering, Stamford, CT. The fluid container<br>
may be suspended from or otherwise connected to or supported by the strain-gauge so that<br>
accurate weight measurements are obtained. A simple hook system for suspending a bag<br>
of fluid is most adequate.<br>
The strain-gauge provides an electronic signal proportional to the weight of the<br>
fluid source, i.e., fluid and container. A simple a strain gauge display may be employed to<br>
process the electronic signal output from the strain-gauge and, after calibration, display the<br>
current weight of the fluid source. A more complex strain gauge processor may be<br>
employed with appropriate memory capacity so that more detailed information can be<br>
displayed showing, for example, the amount of fluid delivered at various times or<br>
sequences as helpful to a surgeon performing a lipoplasty procedure in monitoring the<br>
administration of wetting solution and replacement of withdrawn fluids. In any event,<br>
suitable processing and display capability should be employed to translate the electronic<br>
signal from the strain gauge and display it as an accurate weight or volume. Such a device<br>
is the strain gauge meter model DI50-E-DR-PS1-IS01 manufactured by Texmate Inc.,<br>
Vista, CA.. Preferably, the display has a reset button that will 'zero' the display when<br>
pressed.<br><br>
In addition, it is highly desirable to employ a fluid pumping device that positively<br>
displaces fluids from the fluid source to the patient. For example, it has been found that a<br>
peristaltic pumping system, which is a positive displacement pump design, can be used to<br>
deliver the fluids rapidly and can be adjusted with regard to speed to deliver the fluids at<br>
different rates. In general, it is desirable that the pump be capable of providing fluids at<br>
the one or more rates within the range of about 30 ml/min to 1000 ml/min. For the<br>
convenience of the surgeon it is most desirable that the rate be completely variable within<br>
all or some portion of that range so that the fluid can be provided faster or slower<br>
depending upon the stage of the procedure in which the surgeon is engaged. At the very<br>
least, it is desirable that the surgeon should have at least several options to provide<br>
variability in flow rates. It is important to note that the rate of flow does not affect the<br>
accuracy of fluid flow measurement, since the fluid movement is not inferred from the<br>
activity of the pump, but from the loss of fluid and hence weight from the fluid source.<br>
Positive displacement pumps, preferably peristaltic pumps, are most efficient, result in<br>
accurate displacement of the fluid and are easily adjusted in speed. The use of such a<br>
pump ensures that the weight will be measured by the strain gauge simultaneously with<br>
the removal of fluid from the source and its delivery to the site where needed.<br>
Finally, it is desirable that the system of the invention incorporates a tubing set for<br>
delivery of the fluid from the fluid source to the patient that is of sufficient integrity that<br>
the tubing set does not distend significantly under pump pressure. Tubing sets constructed<br>
of polyvinyl chloride, i.e., "PVC," with appropriate adapters on the ends and wall<br>
thicknesses transfer the fluids from the fluid source to the patient without excessive<br>
distension, thus guaranteeing that fluid pumped from the bag is actually delivered to the<br>
patient or implant. For example, a PVC tube with an inner diameter of 3/16th inches and<br>
an outer diamater of 5/16 inches will work well.<br>
Figure 1 schematically depicts one specific embodiment of the present invention in<br>
which fluid delivery system 10 is used to provide wetting solution to patient 50<br>
undergoing a lipoplasty procedure. A fluid source comprising container 20 and fluid 30 is<br>
suspended from strain gauge 40 which itself is suspended from the usual stand 41,<br><br>
commonly found in hospitals for suspending blood bags and similar fluid sources. In the<br>
same fashion, the container 20 of the present invention may also be a disposable plastic<br>
bag prepackaged to contain a specified amount of sterile wetting solution 30. In the<br>
embodiment depicted the disposable pre-packaged wetting solution is a 1000 ml plastic<br>
bag of sterile saline available from a large number of medical suppliers..<br>
The fluid 30 is transported from container 20 to patient 50 using peristaltic pump<br>
35. In the specific system illustrated this pump is a Watson Marlow pump design, model<br>
313D2 available from Watson Marlow Bredel Inc., Wilmington, MA.. The pump is<br>
connected via a tubing set 31 and 32 to the fluid source and the surgical instrument (not<br>
shown), respectively. The tubing set 32 is made of Tygon® (a registered trademark of the<br>
Norton Company of Worcester, Massachusetts) brand of polyvinyl chloride. Other brands<br>
of PVC tubing will work equally as well.<br>
The pump 35 is connected to controller 36, which permits adjustment of the speed<br>
of the pump system. In this system the pump motor and controller are manufactured by<br>
Oriental Motor USA Corp., Los Angeles, CA, model AXU425. Thus, the surgeon can<br>
control the rate of flow of fluid from the supply 20 to the patient using the controller.<br>
Finally, the strain gauge 20 is electronically connected via wire 42 to processing<br>
unit 43 and display 44.<br>
The novel features of the invention are set forth in the appended claims and in light<br>
of this specification and drawing. It should be apparent to one skilled in the art that other<br>
alternatives are available to those specifically disclosed within this application and can be<br>
employed and within the spirit and scope of the appended claims.<br><br>
