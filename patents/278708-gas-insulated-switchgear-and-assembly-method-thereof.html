				<td>GAS-INSULATED SWITCHGEAR AND ASSEMBLY METHOD THEREOF<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application is based upon and claims the benefit of<br>
priority from the prior Japanese Patent Application No. 2008-034781,<br>
filed on February 15th, 2008; the entire contents of which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[ 0002 ] The present invention relates to a gas-insulated switchgear<br>
used in an electric power station such as a generating station or<br>
a substation, and in particular, relates to a gas-insulated switchgear<br>
in which a three-position disconnector switch/earthing switch having<br>
three positions of ON, OFF and grounding is miniaturized and an<br>
assembly property is improved, and an assembly method thereof.<br>
2.	DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
[0003] In an electric power station such as a substation or a<br>
switching station which is established in a neighborhood of a large<br>
city or in a seaside district, as electric equipment constituting<br>
the substation or the switching station, there is used a gas-insulated<br>
switchgear housing openable/closable electric devices such as a<br>
circuit breaker and a disconnector switch in a container in which<br>
an insulating medium superior in an insulation property and an<br>
extinction property, such as SF6 gas, is filled and sealed, due to<br>
a reason of difficulty of land acquisition and measures against salt<br>
damage.<br>
[0004] In a gas-insulated switchgear, by three-dimensionally<br>
 <br>
disposing a circuit breaker, a disconnector switch or other necessary<br>
devices, intervals between respective devices can be made narrower<br>
and a site area can be reduced. Accordingly, the gas-insulated<br>
switchgear can be constructed substantially smaller compared with<br>
an air-insulated switchgear.<br>
[0005] Further, electric devices are increasingly constructed in<br>
a building or in a basement in large cities, in consideration of<br>
environmental harmony between an electric power station and<br>
surrounding nature or residential zone. In the circumstances,<br>
development is promoted so that respective electric devices are<br>
rationally disposed to further reduce an installation area and volume.<br>
[0006] For example, in JP-A 2000-134733 (KOKAI) and JP-A 10-188746<br>
(KOKAI), there are developed gas-insulated switchgears which are<br>
constructed so that one drive shaft each can drive a movable contactor<br>
common to a disconnector switch and an earthing switch, as examples<br>
to reduce installation areas and volumes.<br>
[0007] In the gas-insulated switchgear described in JP-A<br>
2000-134733 (KOKAI), the common movable contactor which slides on<br>
and fittingly contacts fixed contact portions of the disconnector<br>
switch and the earthing switch that are housed in a gas container<br>
is disposed parallel in relation to a bus-bar conductor, and a portion<br>
of the bus-bar conductor facing the movable contactor is disposed<br>
to be substantially off-centered in relation to a center axis of<br>
the gas container. In other words, a center axis of the portion<br>
of the bus-bar conductor facing the movable contactor is disposed<br>
to be substantially off-centered in relation to the center axis of<br>
the gas container.<br>
[0008] Thus, in the gas-insulated switchgear described in JP-A<br>
 <br>
2000-134733 (KOKAI), an insulation spacer supporting the bus-bar<br>
conductor needs to be mounted in a manner to be substantially<br>
off-centered in relation to the center axis of the gas container.<br>
As a result, an outside diameter of the gas container is required<br>
to be larger compared with an outside diameter of the insulation<br>
spacer.<br>
[0009]  The gas-insulated switchgear described in JP-A 10-188746<br>
(KOKAI) is constructed so that the movable contactor is disposed<br>
with a predetermined angle in relation to an axis direction of the<br>
bus-bar conductor, not parallel to the axis direction of the bus-bar<br>
conductor. In such a construction, since an outer diameter of a<br>
main bus-bar portion of the gas container can be the same as an outer<br>
diameter of an insulation spacer, there is an advantage that the<br>
gas container can be constructed smaller compared with the<br>
gas-insulated switchgear described in JP-A 2000-134733 (KOKAI).<br>
However, the movable contactor and a fixed contactor of the<br>
disconnector switch or the earthing switch are not perpendicular<br>
in relation to a fixed conductor portion of the insulation spacer,<br>
and so an adjustment operation of centering at a time of assembling<br>
is difficult.<br>
[0010] It is also disclosed a gas-insulated switchgear in which<br>
movable contactors are independently provided for a disconnector<br>
switch and an earthing switch instead of a common movable contactor,<br>
and each movable contactor is driven by separate Geneva mechanisms,<br>
for example, in JP-A 11-355926 (KOKAI).<br>
[0011] The gas-insulated switchgear described in JP-A 11-355926<br>
(KOKAI) has a position holding function to allow intermittent actions<br>
and to hold a movable contactor position, so that an assembly property<br>
 <br>
is improved compared with the invention described in JP-A 2000-134733<br>
(KOKAI). However, there is a disadvantage that an outer diameter<br>
of the gas container is larger compared with an outer diameter of<br>
an insulation spacer.<br>
[0012] As described above, in cases of the conventional<br>
gas-insulated switchgears described in JP-A 2000-134733 (KOKAI)<br>
and JP-A 11-355926 (KOKAI), there is a problem that miniaturization<br>
of the device is difficult since the outer diameters of the gas<br>
containers are required to be larger compared with the outer diameters<br>
of the insulation spacers. Meanwhile, in a case of the conventional<br>
gas-insulated switchgear described in JP-A 10-188746 (KOKAI), there<br>
is a problem that the assembly property is deteriorated when a<br>
disposition of devices in the container is altered in order to reduce<br>
the outer diameter of the gas container.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

is to provide a gas-insulated switchgear capable of miniaturizing<br>
a device and also improving an assembly property, and an assembly<br>
method thereof.<br>

(Construction)<br>
[0025] First, a construction will be described with reference to<br>
FIG. 1A, FIG. IB and FIG. 4. A reference numeral "100" indicates<br>
an entire three position disconnector switch/earthing switch for<br>
gas insulated switchgear.<br>
[0026] A reference numeral "1" indicates a gas container housing<br>
a disconnector switch, a switch and other electric components therein<br>
and filling and sealing an insulating medium such as SF6 gas. As<br>
is shown in the drawing, openings la, lb, lc and Id are provided<br>
in upper and lower parts as well as right and left parts of the gas<br>
container respectively. Each of the openings la, lb, lc and Id can<br>
be sealed airtight by an insulation spacer or a cover, as will be<br>
described later.<br>
[0027] Among the openings of the gas container 1, to the opening<br>
la of the upper part, an insulation spacer 2a can be mounted airtight<br>
by a fixing means such as a bolt. One end portion of a main bus-bar<br>
conductor 3 of three-phase construction is fixed to the insulation<br>
 <br>
spacer 2a in advance. Further, the main bus-bar conductor 3 is<br>
accommodated in the gas container 1 in a state that the insulation<br>
spacer 2a is mounted to the gas container 1.<br>
[0028] A fixed contact portion (hereinafter, referred to as a<br>
disconnector switch fixed contact portion) 4 of the disconnector<br>
switch is bored in a position of a center portion in a longitudinal<br>
direction of the main bus-bar contactor 3, the position also being<br>
perpendicular (right-angled) to an axis connecting the right and<br>
left openings 1c, 1d of the gas container 1. Alater-describedmovable<br>
contactor (hereinafter, referred to as a movable contactor) 5 used<br>
commonly by the disconnector switch and the earthing switch is<br>
disposed to be connectable or separatable to/from the disconnector<br>
switch fixed contact portion 4. It should be noted that in the present<br>
embodiment a portion enclosed by a dashed line, the portion being<br>
constituted with the insulation spacer 2a, the main bus-bar contactor<br>
3 and the disconnector switch fixed contact portion 4, is referred<br>
to as a disconnector switch fixed side unit 6 for convenience sake.<br>
[0029 J Further, the other end portion, that is, a lower end portion<br>
3T of the main bus-bar conductor 3 is constructed to be connectable<br>
or separatable to/from an upper end portion 7T of a detachable<br>
conductor 7 having been fixed in advance to an insulation spacer<br>
2b fixed airtight to the opening lb of the lower part of the gas<br>
container 1. It should be noted that the detachable conductor 7<br>
is a component of a detachable unit 8 which will be described later.<br>
[0030] Meanwhile, to the opening lc shown in a right side of the<br>
gas container 1, an insulation spacer 2c can be mounted airtight.<br>
To the insulation spacer 2c, there is fixed in advance a movable<br>
contactor supporting conductor 9 disposed with a predetermined<br>
 <br>
insulation distance apart from the disconnector switch fixed contact<br>
portion 4 bored in the main bus-bar conductor 3.<br>
[0031 ] The movable contactor supporting conductor 9 is constructed<br>
to slidably store and support by a cylindrical portion the movable<br>
contactor 5 to be fitted to the disconnector switch fixed contact<br>
portion 4 and electrically connected thereto. It should be noted<br>
that in the present embodiment a portion enclosed by a dashed line,<br>
the portion being constituted with the insulation spacer 2c, the<br>
movable contactor 5 and the movable contactor supporting conductor<br>
9, is referred to as a movable contactor supporting unit 10 for<br>
convenience sake, A center axis 11 of the insulation spacer 2c is<br>
disposed to be off-centered toward a side of the detachable unit<br>
8 positioned in the lower part of the drawing as seen from a center<br>
axis of the gas container 1.<br>
[0032] In a space portion formed between the movable contactor<br>
supporting conductor 9 and the insulation spacer 2c in the gas<br>
container 1, that is, a space portion formed in a back side of the<br>
movable contactor 5 as seen from the disconnector switch fixed contact<br>
portion 4, there is disposed a fixed contact portion (hereinafter,<br>
referred to as an earthing switch fixed contact portion 13) of the<br>
earthing switch on the same axis as an axis between the disconnector<br>
switch fixed contact portion 4 and the movable contactor 5.<br>
£0033] An external lead-out terminal 14 doubles as a supporting<br>
member of the earthing switch fixed contact portion 13 is mounted<br>
to a mounting surface being a surface flat with the opening la of<br>
the gas container 1. The earthing switch fixed contact portion 13<br>
is to be grounded via the external lead-out terminal 14 doubling<br>
the supporting member. It should be noted that in the present<br>
 <br>
embodiment a portion enclosed by a dashed line, the portion being<br>
constituted with the earthing switch fixed contact portion 13 and<br>
the external lead-out terminal 14, is referred to as an earthing<br>
switch fixed side unit 15 for convenience sake.<br>
[0034] For example, by converting a rotary movement of a driving<br>
shaft 16 to a linear movement with a rack-and-pinion steering, a<br>
linkage lever or the like, the movable contactor 5 is linearly driven<br>
to be connected or separated to/from the disconnector switch fixed<br>
contact portion 4 and the earthing switch fixed contact portion 13.<br>
(0035] A reference numeral "21" shown in FIG. IB indicates an<br>
operational device to rotate-drive the driving shaft 16 via an<br>
insulation rod 22. h reference numeral "17" indicates an inspection<br>
cover to airtightly seal the opening Id of a left side of the gas<br>
container 1.<br>
[0036] Next, the detachable unit 8 will be described with reference<br>
to FIG. 4.The detachable unit 8 is a unit to connect or separate<br>
an upper end portion 7T of the detachable conductor 7 to/from the<br>
lower end portion 3T of the main bus-bar conductor 3. The detachable<br>
unit 8 is constituted with components described below.<br>
[0037] The detachable unit 8 is constituted with an insulation<br>
spacer 2b, the detachable conductor 7 of each phase of three phases<br>
each having been fixed in advance to a predetermined position of<br>
the insulation spacer 2b, and a cylinder 19 which has a flange 19F<br>
fixed by a bolt 18 to a metal mounting ring 2br provided in an outer<br>
periphery portion of the insulation spacer 2b and which is airtightly<br>
and slidably fitted to an inner periphery portion of the opening<br>
lb of the lower part of the gas container 1 via a seal member, and<br>
an attaching/detaching means 20 provided between the flange 19F of<br>
 <br>
the cylinder 19 and a container flange IF formed around the opening<br>
lb of the lower part of the gas container.<br>
[0038] The attaching/detaching means 20 is constituted with a stud<br>
20s having one end portion of which is screwed to a lower surface<br>
of the container flange IF, a nut 20nl fixing the stud 20s in a state<br>
being upright in a forward and backward direction of the cylinder<br>
19, and nuts 20n2, 20n3 disposed on both sides of a through hole<br>
opened in the flange 19F of the cylinder 19 and screwed with the<br>
stud 20s. As for the attaching/detaching means 20, when the nut<br>
20n3 is screwed forward in a state that the nut 20n2 is loosened,<br>
the detachable conductor 7 moves toward the lower end portion 3T<br>
of the main bus-bar conductor 3 together with the cylinder 19 and<br>
the insulation spacer 2b. Then, the detachable conductor 7 is<br>
connected to the lower end portion 3T of the main bus-bar conductor<br>
3	eventually. When the nut 20n2 is fastened in such a state and<br>
pressed hard to the flange 19F, a connected state between the main<br>
bus-bar conductor 3 and the detachable conductor 7 is maintained.<br>
[0039] Next, assembly of the three-position disconnector<br>
switch/earthing switch 100 and an operation of the three-position<br>
disconnector switch/earthing switch will be described with reference<br>
to FIG. 1A to FIG. 4.<br>
(1) Assembling Process<br>
[0040] (i) First, the insulation spacer 2a of the disconnector<br>
switch fixed side unit 6 is mounted airtight to the opening la of<br>
i the upper part of the gas container la, whereby the main bus-bar<br>
conductor 3 in which the disconnector switch fixed contact portion<br>
4	is bored is housed in the gas container 1.<br>
[0041] (ii) Next, the earthing switch fixed side unit 15 is mounted<br>
 <br>
airtight to the mounting surface being the surface flat with the<br>
opening la of upper part of the gas container 1, whereby the earthing<br>
switch fixed contact portion 13 provided in a tip portion of the<br>
earthing switch fixed side unit 15 is housed in the gas container<br>

(ii) can precede the other.<br>
[0042] (iii) Thereafter, the insulation spacer 2c of the movable<br>
contactor supporting unit 10 is mounted to the opening lc of the<br>
right side part of the gas container 1, whereby the movable contactor<br>
5 supported by the movable contactor supporting conductor 9 is<br>
disposed between the disconnector switch fixed contact portion 4<br>
and the earthing switch fixed side unit 15 with predetermined<br>
insulation distances apart each.<br>
[0043] (iv) At a stage that the above-described process (iii) is<br>
finished, the detachable unit 8 is not mounted to the opening lb<br>
of the lower part of the gas container 1 yet. Thus, a state inside<br>
the gas container 1 can be seen from the opening lb of the lower<br>
part and a jig can also be inserted.<br>
[0044] Thus, after the process (iii) is finished, a centering<br>
adjustment operation is performed by the jig or viewing from the<br>
opening lb of the lower part so that axes of the disconnector switch<br>
fixed contact portion 4, the movable contactor 5 and the earthing<br>
switch fixed contact portion 13 are disposed in alignment with one<br>
another.<br>
[0045] (v) After the operation of centering adjustment in the<br>
above-described process (iv), the detachable unit 8 is mounted to<br>
the lower part of the gas container 1 and an upper terminal of the<br>
detachable conductor 7 is connected to a lower terminal of the main<br>
 <br>
bus-bar conductor 3. In the above operation, first, the cylinder<br>
19 is fitted to the opening lb of the lower part of the gas container<br>
1. Then, while the stud 20s fixed to be upright around the opening<br>
lb of the lower part is in a state of being through the through hole<br>
provided in the flange 19F of the cylinder 19, the nut 20n2 is loosen.<br>
Subsequently, the nut 20n3 is turned in a screw forward direction,<br>
whereby the cylinder 19 is pushed up from below and the detachable<br>
conductor 7 fixed to the insulation spacer 2b is pushed forward in<br>
an internal direction of the gas container 1.<br>
[0046] Then, when the upper end portion 7T of the detachable<br>
conductor 7 becomes in a state of being connected to the lower end<br>
portion 3T of the main bus-bar conductor 3 with an adequate pressure,<br>
the nut 20n2 is turned in a reverse direction to strongly press the<br>
stud 20s to the flange 19F, so that a fixed state of the detachable<br>
unit 8 to the gas container lower part is maintained. Hereby, the<br>
assembly of the three-position disconnector switch/earthing switch<br>
100 of the gas-insulated switchgear is completed.<br>
(2) Operation of Three-position Disconnector Switch/Earthing Switch<br>
[0047] FIG. 1A shows a state that the three-position disconnector<br>
switch/earthing switch is in the OFF state. In other words, the<br>
movable contactor 5 is housed in the movable contactor supporting<br>
conductor 9 of the movable contactor supporting unit 10, and in a<br>
state of not being connected to either the disconnector switch fixed<br>
contact portion 4 or the earthing switch fixed contact portion 13,<br>
that is, in a state of "disconnector switch OFF" and "earthing switch<br>
OFF".<br>
[0048] In the above state, when the operational device 21 is<br>
operated for "disconnector switch ON" by a motor action by remote<br>
 <br>
control or a direct handle operation, a rotational force from the<br>
operational device 21 is transmitted to a converting means converting<br>
a rotary movement of a rack-and-pinion steering, a linkage lever<br>
or the like to a linear movement, via the insulation rod 22 and the<br>
driving shaft 16 in the gas container 1. Then, by this converting<br>
means, the rotary movement is converted to the linear movement and<br>
a driving force is transmitted to the three-phase movable contactor<br>
5.<br>
[ 0049] By the above driving force, the movable contactor 5 is moved<br>
from the position in FIG. 1A to a main bus-bar conductor 3 side and<br>
stops at a position in FIG. 2, in which the movable contactor 5 is<br>
connected to the disconnector switch fixed contact portion 4. A<br>
state in FIG. 2 is a state of "disconnector switch ON" and "earthing<br>
switch OFF".<br>
[ 0050 ] On the other hand, when the operational device 21 is operated<br>
for "earthing switch ON", the movable contactor 5 is moved to the<br>
opposite side of the main bus-bar conductor 2, that is, to an earthing<br>
switch fixed contactor 13 side, and stops at a position in FIG. 3,<br>
in which the movable contactor 5 is connected to the earthing switch<br>
l fixed contact portion 13. A state in FIG. 3 is a state of "disconnector<br>
switch OFF" and "earthing switch ON".<br>
(Effect)<br>
[0051] As described above, according to the present embodiment,<br>
effects described below can be attained.<br>
5 [0052] (i) The movable contactor 5 used by both the disconnector<br>
switch and the earthing switch is disposed to be almost orthogonal<br>
to the main bus-bar conductor 3 and the earthing switch fixed contact<br>
portion 13 is disposed behind the movable contactor 5 in a manner<br>
 <br>
that the axes of the movable contactor 5 and the earthing switch<br>
fixed contact portion 13 become aligned as seen from the disconnector<br>
switch fixed contact portion 4, and there is disposed the detachable<br>
unit 8 having the detachable conductor 7 to be connected or separated<br>
to/from the lower end portion 3T of the main bus-bar conductor 3,<br>
and further, the center axis 11 of the insulation spacer 2c of the<br>
movable contactor supporting unit 10 supporting the movable contactor<br>
5 is disposed to be off-centered toward the detachable unit 8 side<br>
as seen from the center axis 12 of the gas container 1. As a result,<br>
miniaturization and the assembly property of the three-position<br>
disconnector switch/earthing switch can be improved.<br>
[0053] (ii) Further, it is constructed so that the movable<br>
contactor supporting unit 10 is inserted to the gas container 1 and<br>
assembled after the disconnector switch fixed side unit 6 and the<br>
earthing switch fixed side unit 15 are assembled in the gas container<br>
1. As a result, it is possible to improve the centering adjustment<br>
operation to dispose the axes of the disconnector switch fixed side<br>
unit 6, the earthing switch fixed side unit 15 and the movable contactor<br>
5 aligned with one another from the opening lb of the lower part<br>
of the gas container 1.<br>
[0054] (iii) Further, it is disposed so that the mounting surface<br>
of the disconnector switch fixed side unit 6 of the gas container<br>
1 and the mounting surface of the earthing switch fixed side unit<br>
15 of the gas container 1 become the same mounting surface. As a<br>
result, it is possible to improve the centering adjustment operation<br>
to dispose the disconnector switch fixed side unit 6, the earthing<br>
switch fixed side unit 15 and the movable contactor 5 aligned with<br>
one another. It should be noted even if there is a level difference<br>
 <br>
between the mounting surface of the disconnector switch fixed side<br>
unit 6 and the mounting surface of the earthing switch fixed side<br>
unit 15, a similar effect can be attained as long as both the mounting<br>
surfaces are almost parallel to each other.<br>
[0055] (iv) Furthermore, since the detachable unit 8 is disposed<br>
in the opposite side of the earthing switch fixed side unit 15, the<br>
earthing switch fixed side unit 15 is not in a neighborhood. As<br>
a result a local assembling space of the detachable unit 8 side can<br>
be secured, improving the assembling property.<br>
[0056] (v) Since the opening lb of the gas container 1, the opening<br>
lb being the mounting surface of the detachable unit 8, is used at<br>
a time of internal assembling, it is not required to provide the<br>
gas container 1 with an unnecessary assembling hole. Therefore,<br>
it becomes possible to construct the gas container 1 without reducing<br>
strength of the container 1. Thereby, reliability of the device<br>
is improved and the centering adjustment operation of the<br>
three-position disconnector switch/earthing switch 100 by a jig or<br>
viewing can be improved.<br>
[0057] Further, a structure is adopted that the detachable<br>
conductor 7 is slidably fit to the gas container 1 via the insulation<br>
spacer 2b and the cylinder 19 to seal the gas. As a result, in<br>
intercircuit unit connection at a local mounting location of the<br>
gas-insulated switchgear, a connection operation to other equipment<br>
can be easily done by extending/retracting the detachable conductor<br>
7 in the longitudinal direction of the main bus-bar conductor 3.<br>
[0058] (vi) Further, since it is constructed so that an operational<br>
ground terminal is drew out per phase, an effect of improved<br>
workability at a time of inspection of the gas-insulated switchgear<br>
 <br>
can be also attained in a three-position disconnector switch/earthing<br>
switch 100 which is constituted small-sized.<br>
