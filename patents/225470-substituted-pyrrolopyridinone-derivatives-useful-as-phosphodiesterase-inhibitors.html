CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This application claims priority from United States provisional application<br>
Serial No 60/204,646 filed May 17,2000, the contents of which are hereby<br>
incorporated by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to novel pyrrolopyridinone derivatives, intermediates<br>
used in, synthesis of and pharmaceutical compositions containing the<br>
compounds and their use for the treatment of sexual dysfunction. The<br>
compounds of the present invention are phosphodiesterase inhibitors usefull for<br>
the treatment of sexual dysfunction, more particularly male erectile dysfunction.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVFNTION<br>
Erectile dysfunction (ED) is defined as the inability to achieve or maintain<br>
an erection sufficiently rigid for satisfactory sexual intercourse. Currently it is<br>
estimated that approximately 7-8% of the male population suffer from some<br>
degree of EO. the equivalent of at least 20 million men in the United States alone<br>
Since the likelihood of ED increases with age, it is projected that the incidence of<br>
this condition will rise in the future as the average age of the population increases.<br>
Male erectile dysfunction may be the consequence of psychogenic<br>
and/or organic factors Although ED is multi-factorial, certain sub-groups within<br>
the male population are more likely to present with The symptoms of the<br>
disorder. In particular, patients with diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and<br>
multiple sclerosis have a particulariy high prevalence of ED. In addition,<br>
patients who take certain classes of drugs such as antihypertensives,<br>
antidepressgnts, sedatives, and anxiolytics are more prone to suffer from ED.<br>
Treatments for ED Include a variety of pharmacologic agents, vacuum<br>
devices, and penile prostheses. Among the pharmacologic agents, papaverine,<br>
phentolamine, and alprostadil are currently used in practice. These agents are<br>
only effective after direct intracavernosal or intraurethral injection, and are<br>
associated with side effects such as priapism, fibrosis, penile pain and hematoma<br>
at the injection site. Vacuum devices are a noninasive alternative treatment for<br>
ED. These devices produce an erection by creating a negative pressure around<br>
the shaft of the penis resulting in an increased blood flow into the corpus<br>
cavernosum via passive arterial dilation. Although this form of therapy is<br>
frequently successful in ED of organic origin, complaints include the lack of<br>
spontaneity and the time involved in using a mechanical device, and difficulty and<br>
discomfort with ejaculation. A variety of semi-rigid or inflatable penile prostheses<br>
have been used with some success, particularly in diabetic men. These devices<br>
are generally considered when other treatment options have failed, and are<br>
associated with an increased risk of infection and ischemia.<br>
Recently, the phosphodiesterase V (PDEV) inhibitor, sildenafil (Viagra®)<br>
was approved by the FDA as an orally effective medication for the treatment of<br>
ED. Sildenafil, 5-[2-ethoxy-5-(4-fnethvlpiperazin-1 -ylsulphonyl)phenyl]-1 -rnethyl-3-<br>
n-propyl-6,7-dihydro-1H-pyrazolo]4oJ4,3-dlpynimidin-7-one and a number of related<br>
analogs and their use as antianginai agents are described in U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
5,250,534 and 5,346,901. The use of sildenafil and related analogs for treating<br>
male erectile dysfunction is described in PCT International Application Publication<br>
No. WO 94/28902. published December 22,1994. In clinical studies, the drug<br>
improved sexual function in about 70% of the men who suffer from ED of<br>
psychogenic or organic etiology. However, the drug showed less dramatic efficacy<br>
in patients who had undergone a radical prostatectomy, with improved erections in<br>
43% of patients who took sildenafil versus 15% on placebo. In addition, the use<br>
of sildenafi! is associated with several undesirable side effects including<br>
headache, flushing and disrupted color vision which result from non-selective<br>
effects on a varietv of tissues. In spite of these shortcomings, the drug is viewed<br>
by patients as preferable to other treatments which involve the introduction of<br>
medication directly into the penis via injection, the use of an external device or a<br>
surgical procedure.<br>
Daugan et.al, in US Patent No. 5.859,009 and EP 0740668 B1 describe the<br>
synthesis of a series of tetracydic derivatives as inhibitors of cyclic guanosine 3',5'<br>
monophosphate specifically phosphodiesterase, and their use in treating<br>
cardiovascular disorders. Daugan et.al., in WO97/03675 teach the use of the<br>
tetracyclic derivatives for the treatment of impotence.<br>
Garinaux, J.-F. et al., in Tetrahedron Letters 38(17), (1997), pp 2997-3000<br>
disclose the synthesis of tricydic quinolone derivatives via oxidation of 1,2,3,4-<br>
tetrahydro-ß-carbolines.<br>
pfenninger, E. in DE 2803541 and US Patent No. 4,235,907 discloses<br>
substituted 9H-pyrrolo-[3,4-b]quinolin-9-ones and their use in the treatment of<br>
allergic asthma.<br>
Sexually stimulated penile erection results from a complex interplay of<br>
physiological processes involving the central nervous system, the peripheral<br>
nervous system, and the smooth muscle. Specifically, release of nitric oxide from<br>
the non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic nerves and endothelium activates guanylyl<br>
cyclase and increases intracellular cGMP levels within the corpus cavemosum.<br>
The increase in intracellular cGMP reduces intracellular calcium levels, resulting in<br>
trabecular smooth muscle relaxation, which, in turn, results in corporal volume<br>
expansion and compression of the sub-tunical venules leading to penile erection.<br>
PDEV has been found in human platelets and vascular smooth muscle,<br>
suggesting a role for this enzyme in the regulation of intracellular concentrations<br>
of cGMP in cardiovascular tissue. In fact, inhibitors of PDEV have been shown to<br>
produce endothelial-dependent vasorelaxation by potentiating the increases in<br>
intracellular cGMP induced by nitric oxide. Moreover, PDEV inhibitors selectively<br>
lower the pulmonary arterial pressure in animal models of congestive heart failure<br>
and pulmonary hypertension. Hence in addition to their utility in ED, PDEV<br>
inhibitors would likely be of therapeutic benefit in conditions like heart failure,<br>
pulmonary hypertension, and angina.<br>
Agents that increase the concentration of cGMP in penile tissue, either<br>
through enhanced release or reduced breakdown of cGMP, are expected to be<br>
effective treatments for ED. The intracellular levels of cGMP are regulated by the<br>
enzymes involved in its formation and degradation, namely the guanyiate cyclases<br>
and the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs). To date, at least nine<br>
families of mammalian PDEs have been described, five of which are capable of<br>
hydrolyzing the active, cGMP, to the inactive, GMP, under physiological conditions<br>
(PDEs I, II, V, VI, and IX). PDE V is the predominant isoform in human corpus<br>
cavernosum. Inhibitors of PDEV, therefore, would be expected to increase the<br>
concentration of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum and enhance the duration and<br>
frequency of penile erection.<br>
Additionally, selective PDE inhibitors are known to be useful in the<br>
treatment of various disorders and conditions including male erectile<br>
dysfunction (ED), female sexual arousal dysfunction, female sexual<br>
dysfunction related to blood flow and nitric oxide production in the tissues of<br>
the vagina and clitoris, premature labor, dysmenorrhea, cardiovascular<br>
disorders, atherosclerosis, arterial occlusive disorders, thrombosis, coronary<br>
rest stenosis, angina pectoris, myocardia! infarction, heart failure, ischemic<br>
heart disorders, hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, asthma, intermittent<br>
claudication and diabetic complications.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to identify compounds which<br>
increase the concentration of cGMP in penile tissue through the inhibition of<br>
phosphodiesterases, specifically PDEV. It is another object of the invention to<br>
identify compounds which are useful for the treatment of sexual dysfunction,<br>
particularly erectile dysfunction and/or impotence in male animals and sexual<br>
dysfunction in female animals. Still another object of the invention is to identify<br>
methods for treating sexual dysfunction, especially erectile dysfunction, using the<br>
compounds of the present invention.<br>
It is another object of the invention to identify compounds which are<br>
useful for the treatment of conditions of disorders mediated by PDEV, such as<br>
male erectile dysfunction, female sexual dysfunction, cardiovascular disorders,<br>
atherosclerosis, arterial occlusive disorders, thrombosis, coronary reststenosis,<br>
angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, heart failure, ischemic heart disorders,<br>
hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, asthma, intermittent claudication or<br>
diabetic complications.<br>
We now describe a series of pyrrolopyrkjinone derivatives with the ability to<br>
inhibit phosphodiesterase type V in enzyme assays.<br>

the compound of formula (XXVIII) by recrystallization or silica gel<br>
chromatography.<br>
The compound of formula (XXVII) (the S-diastereomer) is converted to<br>
the desired R-diastereomer, the compound of formula (XXVIII), by stirring the<br>
compound of formula (XXVII) in an acid such as TFA, HCI, TsOH, and the like,<br>
in the presence of an organic solvent such as CH2CI2, DCM, 1m4-dioxane, and<br>
the like, to yield the desired R-diastereomer, the compound of formula (XXVIII).<br>
The compound of formula (XXVIII) is reacted with an oxidizing agent<br>
such as oxygen gas, singlet oxygen, KO2, NalO4, ozone, and the like,<br>
preferably oxygen gas at about atmospheric pressure, to yield the<br>
corresponding compound of formula (XXIX). When the oxidizing agent is<br>
oxygen gas, the reaction is carried out in the presence of a base such as<br>
sodium hydride, potassium-t-butoxide, and the like, in an organic solvent such<br>
as DMF, DMSO, NMP, and the like.<br>
The compound of formula (XXIX) is reacted with a reducing agent such<br>
as hydrogen gas, in the presence of a catalyst such as palladium on carbon, in<br>
a polar solvent such as methanol, ethanol, and the like, to yield the<br>
corresponding compound of formula (Villa).<br>
The compound of formula (Villa) may then be further reacted to yield the<br>
corresponding compound of formula (I) according to the process outlined in<br>
Scheme 3 above.<br>
For compounds of formula (I), wherein R1 is other than hydrogen, a second<br>
chiral center will exist at the bond of the R1 group to the pyrrolopyridinone. If a<br>
specific orientation of the R1 group is present in the starting reagent, the<br>
compound of formula (XXV) in Scheme 10 above, its orientation will impact the<br>
conversion of diastereomers.<br>
Where the processes for the preparation of the compounds according to<br>
the invention give rise to a mixture of stereoisomers, these isomers mav be<br>
separated by conventional techniques such as preparative chromatography.<br>
The compounds may be prepared in racemic form, or individual enantiomers<br>
may be prepared by enantioselective synthesis, by resolution or from<br>
enantiomerically enriched reagents. The compounds may, for example, be<br>
resolved into their component enantiomers by standard techniques, such as<br>
the formation of diastereomeric pairs by salt formation with an optically active<br>
acid, such as (-)-di-p-toluoyl-d-tartaric acid and/or (+)-di-p-toluoyl-l-tartaric acid<br>
followed by fractional crystallization and regeneration of the free base. The<br>
compounds may also be resolved by formation of diastereomeric esters,<br>
amides or amines, followed by chromatographic separation and removal of the<br>
chiral auxiliary. Alternatively, the compounds may be resolved using a chiral<br>
HPLC column.<br>
During any of the processes for preparation of the compounds of the<br>
present invention, it may be necessary and/or desirable to protect sensitive or<br>
reactive groups on any of the molecules concerned. This may be achieved by<br>
means of conventional protecting groups, such as those described in<br>
Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, ed. J.F.W. McOmie, Plenum Press,<br>
1973; and T.W. Greene &amp; P.G.M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Oraanic<br>
Synthesis. John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1991. The protecting groups may be removed<br>
at a convenient subsequent stage using methods known from the art.<br>
The utility of the compounds to treat sexual dysfunction can be<br>
determined according to the procedures described in Example 95, 96 and 97<br>
herein.<br>
The present invention therefore provides a method of treating sexual<br>
dysfunction, more particularly male erectile dysfunction in a subject in need<br>
thereof which comprises administering any of the compounds as defined<br>
herein in a quantity effective to treat ED. The compound may be administered<br>
to a patient by any conventional route of administration, including, but not<br>
limited to, intravenous, oral, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intradermal and<br>
parenteral. The quantity of the compound which is effective for treating ED is<br>
between 0.01 mg per kg and 20 mg per kg of subject body weight.<br>
The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions<br>
comprising one or more compounds of this invention in association with a<br>
pharmaceuticaliy acceptable carrier. Preferably these compositions are in unit<br>
dosage forms such as tablets, pills, capsules, powders, granules, sterile<br>
parenteral solutions or suspensions, metered aerosol or liquid sprays, drops,<br>
ampoules, autoinjector devices or suppositories; for oral parenteral, intranasal,<br>
sublingual or rectal administration, or for administration by inhalation or<br>
insufflation./ Alternatively, the composition may be presented in a form suitable<br>
for once-weekly or once-monthly administration; for example, an insoluble salt<br>
gf the active compound,such as the decanoate salt, may be adapted to<br>
provide a depot preparation for intramuscular injection, for preparing solid<br>
compositions such as tablets, the principal active ingredient is mixed with a<br>
pharmaceutical carrier, e.g. conventional tableting ingredients such as com<br>
starch, lactose, sucrose, sorbitol, talc, stearic acid, magnesium stearate,<br>
dicalciurn phosphate or gums, and other pharmaceutical diluents, e.g. water, to<br>
form a solid preformulation composition containing a homogeneous mixture of<br>
a compound of the present invention, or a pharmaceuticaliy acceptable salt<br>
thereof. When referring to these preformulation compositions as<br>
homogeneous, it is meant that the active ingredient is dispersed evenly<br>
throughout the composition so that the composition may be readily subdivided<br>
into equally effective dosage forms such as tablets, pills and capsules. This<br>
solid preformulation composition is then subdivided into unit dosage forms of<br>
the type described above containing from 1 to about 1000 mg of the active<br>
ingredient of the present invention. The tablets or pills of the novel<br>
composition can be coated or otherwise compounded to provide a dosage form<br>
affording the advantage of prolonged action. For example, the tablet or pill can<br>
comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component, the latter being in<br>
the form of an envelope over the former. The two components can be<br>
separated by an enteric layer which serves to resist disintegration in the.<br>
stomach and permits the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or<br>
to be delayed in release. A variety of material can be used for such enteric<br>
layers or coatings, such materials including a number of polymeric acids with<br>
such materials as shellac, cetyl alcohol and cellulose acetate.<br>
The liquid forms in which the novel compositions of the present<br>
invention may be incorporated for administration orally or by injection include,<br>
aqueous solutions, suitably flavoured syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions, and<br>
flavoured emulsions with edible oils such as cottonseed oil, sesame oil,<br>
coconut oil or peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles.<br>
Suitable dispersing or suspending agents for aqueous suspensions, include<br>
synthetic and natural gums such as tragacanth, acacia, alginate, dextran,<br>
sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone or<br>
gelatin.<br>
The method of treating sexual dysfunction, more particularly male erectile<br>
dysfunction described in the present invention may also be carried out using a<br>
pharmaceutical composition comprising any of the compounds as defined herein<br>
and a pharmaceuticaliy acceptable carrier. The pharmaceutical composition<br>
may contain between about 1 mg and 1000 mg, preferably about 1 to 200 mg, of<br>
the compound, and may be constituted into any form suitable for the mode of<br>
administration selected. Carriers include necessary and inert pharmaceutical<br>
excipients, including, but not limited to, binders, suspending agents, lubricants,<br>
flavorants, sweeteners, preservatives, dyes, and coatings. Compositions<br>
suitable for oral administration include solid forms, such as pills, tablets, caplets,<br>
capsules (each including immediate release, timed release and sustained<br>
release formulations), granules, and powders, and liquid forms, such as<br>
solutions, syrups, elixers, emulsions, and suspensions. Forms useful for<br>
parenteral administration include sterile solutions, emulsions and suspensions.<br>
Advantageously, compounds of the present invention may be<br>
administered in a single daily dose, or the total daily dosage may be<br>
administered in divided doses of two, three or four times daily. Furthermore,<br>
compounds for the present invention can be administered in rntranasal form via<br>
topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles, or via transdermal skin patches well<br>
known to those of ordinary skill in that art. To be administered in the form of a<br>
transdermal delivery system, the dosage administration will, of course, be<br>
continuous rather than intermittent throughout the dosage regimen.<br>
For instance, for oral administration in the form of a tablet or capsule, the<br>
active drug component can be combined with an oral, non-toxic pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable inert carrier such as ethanol, glycerol, water and the like. Moreover,<br>
when desired or necessary, suitable binders, lubricants, disintegrating agents<br>
and coloring agents can also be incorporated into the mixture. Suitable binders<br>
include, without limitation, starch, gelatin, natural sugars such as glucose or<br>
beta-lactose, com sweeteners, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia,<br>
tragacanth or sodium oleate, sodium stearate, magnesium stearate, sodium<br>
benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium chloride and the like. Disintegrators include,<br>
without limitation, starch, methyl cellulose, agar, bentonite, xanthan gum and the<br>
like.<br>
The liquid forms may include suitably flavored suspending or dispersing<br>
agents such as the synthetic and natural gums, for example, tragacanth, acacia,<br>
methyl-cellulose and the like. For parenteral administration, sterile suspensions<br>
and solutions are desired. Isotonic preparations which generally contain suitable<br>
preservatives are employed when intravenous administration is desired.<br>
The compound of the present invention can also be administered in the<br>
form of liposome delivery systems, such as small unilamellar vesicles, large<br>
unilamellar vesicles, and multilamellar vesicles. Liposomes can be formed from<br>
a variety of phospholipids, such as cholesterol, stearylamine or<br>
phophatidylcholines.<br>
Compounds of the present invention may also be delivered by the use of<br>
monoclonal antibodies as individual earners to which the compound molecules<br>
are coupled. The compounds of the present invention may also be coupled with<br>
soluble polymers as targetable drug carriers. Such polymers can include<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, pyran copolymer, poiyhydroxypropyimethaciylarnidephenol,<br>
polyhydroxyethylaspartamidephenol, or polyethyl-eneoxidepolylysine substituted<br>
with palmitoyl residue. Furthermore, the compounds of the present invention<br>
may be coupled to a class of biodegradable polymers useful in achieving<br>
controlled release of a drug, for example, polylactic acid, polyepsilon<br>
caprolactone, polyhydroxy butyric acid, polyorthoesters, polyacetals,<br>
polydihydropyrans, polycyanoacryiates and cross-linked or amphipathic block<br>
copolymers of hydrogels.<br>
Compounds of this invention may be administered in any of the foregoing<br>
compositions and according to dosage regimens established in the art whenever<br>
treatment of sexual dysfunction, more particularly male erectile dysfunction is<br>
required.<br>
The daily dosage of the products may be varied over a wide range from 1<br>
to 1,000 mg per adult human per day. For oral administration, the compositions<br>
are preferably provided in the form of tablets containing 1.0, 5.0, 10.0,15.0, 25.0,<br>
50.0,100,250 and 500 milligrams of the active ingredient for the symptomatic<br>
adjustment of the dosage to the patient to be treated- An effective amount of the<br>
drug is ordinarily supplied at a dosage level of from about 0,01 mg/kg to about 20<br>
mg/kg of body weight per day. Preferably, the range is from about 0.1 mg/kg to<br>
about 10 mg/kg of body weight per day, and especially from about 0.1 mg/kg to<br>
about 3 mg/kg of body weight per day.<br>
Optimal dosages to be administered may be readily determined by those<br>
skilled in the art, and will vary with the particular compound used, the mode of<br>
administration, the strength of the preparation, the mode of administration, and<br>
the advancement of the disease condition. In addition, factors associated with<br>
the particular patient being treated, including patient age, weight, diet and time of<br>
administration, will result in the need to adjust dosages.<br>

IN VITRO TESTING<br>
Cydic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterase (PDEt Assay<br>
PDEV Isolation<br>
PDEV was isolated from rabbit and human tissues according to the<br>
protocol described by Boolell et al. [Boolell, M., Alien, M. J., Ballard, S. A., Ge[o-<br>
Attee, S., Muirhead, G. J., Naytor, A. M., Osterloh, I. H., and Gingell, C) in<br>
International Journal of Impotence Research 1996 8,47-52 with minor<br>
modifications.<br>
Briefly, rabbit or human tissues were homogenized in an ice-cold buffer<br>
solution containing 20mM HEPES (pH 7.2), 0.25M sucrose, 1mM EDTA, and<br>
1 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF). The homogenates were centrifuged<br>
at 100,000g for 60 minutes at 4*C. The supernatant was filtered through 0.2jiM<br>
filter and loaded bo a Pharmacia Mono Q anion exchange column (1ml bed<br>
volume) that was equilibrated v«th 20mM HEPES, 1mM EDTA and O.SmM PMSF.<br>
After washing out unbound proteins, the enzymes were eluted with a linear<br>
gradient of 100-600 mM NaCI in the same buffer (35 to 50 ml total, depending on<br>
the tissue. Enzymes from the skeletal muscle, corpus cavemosum, retina, heart<br>
and platelet were eluted with 35,40, 45, 50, and 50 ml respectively.) The column<br>
was run at a flow rate of 1ml/min and 1ml fractions were collected. The fractions<br>
comprising various PDE activities were pooled separately and used in teter<br>
studies.<br>
Measurement of Inhibition of PDEV<br>
The PDE assay was carried out as described by Thompson and Appleman<br>
in Biochemistry 1971 10, 311-316 with minor modifications, as noted below.<br>
The assays were adapted to a 96-well format. The enzyme was assayed in<br>
5mM MgCI2,15mM Tris HCl (pH 7.4), 0.5 mglm! bovine serum albumin, 1 µM<br>
cGMP or cAMP, 0.1 µCi [3H]-cGMP or [3H]-cAMP, and 2-10 µl of column elution.<br>
The total volume of the assay was 100 µl. The reaction mixture was incubated at<br>
30*C for 30 minutes. The reaction was stopped by boiling for 1 minute and then<br>
cooled down on ice. The resulting [3H]5'-mononucleotides were further converted<br>
to uncharged [3H3-nucleosides by adding 25 yl 1 mg/ml snake venom<br>
(Ophiophagus hannah) and incubating at 30°C for 10 minute. The reaction was<br>
stopped by the addition of 1 ml Bio-Rad AG1-X2 resin slurry (1:3). All the charged<br>
nucleotides were bound by the resin and only uncharged [3H]-nucleosides<br>
remained in the supernatant after centrifuging. An aliquot of 200 ^l was taken and<br>
counted by liquid scintillation. PDE activity was expressed as pmol cyclic<br>
nucleotide hydrolyzed/min/ml of enzyme preparation.<br>
Inhibitor studies were earned out in assay buffer with a final concentration<br>
of 10% DMSO. Under these conditions, the hydrolysis of product increased with<br>
time and enzyme concentration in a linear fashion<br>
Example 96<br>
In Vitro Determination of Kt fr&gt;r Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors:<br>
The assays were adapted to a 96-well format. Phosphodiesterase was<br>
assayed in 5mM MgCI2,15mM Tris HCI (pH 7.4), 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum<br>
albumin. 30 nM 3H-cGMP and test compound at various concentrations. The<br>
amount of enzyme used for each reaction was such that less than 15% of the<br>
initial substrate was converted during the assay period. For all measurements,<br>
the test compound was dissolved and diluted in 100% DMSO (2%DMSO in<br>
assay). The total volume of the assay was 100 µl. The reaction mixture was<br>
incubated at 30'C for 90 minutes. The reaction was stopped by boiling for 1<br>
minute and then immediately cooled by transfer to an ice bath. To each well was<br>
then added 25 yl 1 mg/ml snake venom (Ophiophagus hannah) and the reaction<br>
mixture incubating at 30"C for 10 minute. The reaction was stopped by the<br>
addition of 1 ml Bio-Rad AG1-X2 resin slurry (1:3). An aliquot of 200 uJ was taken<br>
and counted by liquid scintillation.<br>
The % inhibition of the maximum substrate conversion (by the enzyme<br>
in the absence of inhibitor) was calculated for each test compound<br>
concentration. Using GraphPad Prism's nonlinear regression analysis<br>
(sigmoidal dose response), the % inhibition vs log of the test compound<br>
concentration was plotted to determine the IC50. Under conditions where<br>
substrate concentration « Km of the enzyme (Km = substrate concentration at<br>
which half of the maximal velocity of the enzyme is achieved), K is equivalent<br>
to the IC50 value.<br>
Following procedures as described herein, the compounds as listed in<br>
Tables 1-6 were prepared. PDEV inhibitory activities for these compounds are<br>
presented either as the IC50 (µM), as a percent inhibition at a given concentration<br>
of test compound or as a Ki value in the Tables below. Unless otherwise noted.<br>
PDEV inhibitory activities were measured using human tissue. The abbreviation<br>
"stereo" refers to the stereogenic configuration, the abbreviation "Rac" shall<br>
denote a racemic mixture.<br>
