				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a one-pot chemoenzymatic process for the stereo selective preparation of chiral secondary alcohols from corresponding ketones. In the process, optically pure secondary alcohols have been obtained in good yields and high enantiomeric excess by one-pot reduction of ketones followed by lipase-mediated transesterificaiton. The faster reaction rates with high selectivity in organic media like hexane and environmentally acceptable reaction conditions provides a practical in situ biocatalytic resolution process of the secondary alcohols from their carbonyl precursors-ketones under mild conditions.</td>

				<td>Secondary alcohols having enantiomeric purity are important synthetic<br>
intermediates and are useful chiral auxiliaries in both synthetic and analytical chemistry<br>
applications (J. Chem. Soc., Chem. Commun. 1988, 1459). Because of the wide<br>
applicability of secondary alcohols; there has been an interest and demand to synthesize<br>
them in enantiomerically pure form. Many methods have been reported in the literature<br>
based on enantioselective reduction of the corresponding ketones. (Tetrahedron. Lett.<br>
2000, 41, 4135; Tetrahedron: Asymmetry 2000, 11, 3671). These include the use of<br>
chiral reducing agents, chiral boranes, chiral catalysts, enantioselective homogeneous<br>
hydrogenation, and the reduction employing the whole cells*<br>
On the other hand these chiral secondary alcohols have been synthesized by<br>
enzymatic transesterification of the racemic alcohols or by enzymatic hydrolysis of the<br>
corresponding esters. (Tetrahedron Lett. 2001, 42 1107). The recent studies on the use of<br>
enzymes in low polarity organic solvents initially discovered by Klibanov, has allowed<br>
to extend these reactions for the enzymatic resolution by esterification and<br>
transesterification (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1985, 82, 3192). The resolution based on<br>
enzymatic transesterification overcomes some of the important practical problems<br>
associated with the enzymatic hydrolysis such as, low solubility of many organic<br>
compounds in water, the recovery of the enzyme for recycling and the need for pH<br>
adjustment during the reaction process. A recent study on the alumina-assisted reduction<br>
of carbonyl compounds with sodium borohydride in an aprotic solvent like hexane (Can.<br>
J. Chem. 1998, 76, 1916), and our interest in biotransformations prompted us to explore<br>
the transesterification employing the lipase in the same pot for the enantioselective<br>
preparation of secondary alcohols.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a one-pot<br>
chemoenzymatic process for the stereoselective preparation of secondary alcohols from<br>
corresponding ketones.<br>
In the drawings accompanying this specification Figure-1 is the schematic<br>
representation of this process towards the preparation of both enantiomers of secondary<br>
alcohols in high enantiomeric excess.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a one-pot chemoenzymatic process for the stereo selective preparation of chiral secondary alcohols from corresponding ketones which comprises:<br>
a)	reacting ketone selected from the group consisting of acetophenone, propiophenone, 2-chloropropiophenone, 4-benzyloxy acetophenone, 4-allyloxy acetophenone,4-allyloxy acetophenone and 4-nitro acetophenone with a reducing agent sodium borohydride in a molar ratio in the range of 1:1.5-1:2.5 in an organic solvent as herein described at a temperature in the range of 30-50°C for a period of 2-4 hrs,<br>
b)	adding Lipase selected from the group consisting of Pseudomonas cepacia lipase (Amano PS), immobilized lipase PS-amano C, PS-Amano D, and Pseudomonas fluorescence and an acetylating agent selected from isopropenyl acetate and vinyl acetate to the above said reaction mixture,<br>
c)	stirring the above said reaction mixture for a period of 4-12 hrs, at a temperature of 20-30 C to obtain the corresponding recimic alcohol (2) and recemic acetate (3),<br>
d)	reacting the above said recemic acetate (3) with potassium bicarbonate in an organic solvent as mentioned in step a), at a temperature of 20-30°C for period of 2-4 hrs to obtain the desired recemic alcohol (4)<br>
In yet another embodiment the organic solvent used is selected from the group consisting of hexane, diisopropyl ether, t-butylmethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and toluene.<br>
In yet another embodiment the lipase used is selected from the group consisting of Pseudomonas cepacia lipase (Amano PS), immobilized lipase PS-Amano C, PS-Amano D, and Pseudomonas fluorescence.<br>
In yet another embodiment the acetylating agent used is selected from vinyl acetate and isopropenyl acetate.<br>
In yet another embodiment the enantiomeric excess is &gt;99%.<br>
In yet another embodiment the neutral alumina and lipase used are recyclable for one-pot transesterification.<br>
An enzymatic process for the stereoselective preparation of secondary alcohols<br>
from the corresponding carbonyl compounds, which comprises reduction of ketones<br>
with sodium borohydride and moist neutral alumina in hexane. The reduction products<br>
thus obtained were further subjected for lipase-mediated transesterification process in<br>
the same pot (Table 1).<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the alcohol and the ester<br>
formed in the kinetic resolution were separated by column chromatography. Absolute<br>
configuration was ascertained by the values of optical rotation and the enantiomeric<br>
purity was confirmed by HPLC employing chiral column.<br>
The process of the present invention is illustrated below:<br>
1. Use of sodium borohydride in presence of moist neutral alumina for reduction of<br>
ketones.<br>
2. Reduction of ketones was carried out at 40 °C for 3-5 hours.<br>
3. After the complete reduction, the racemic alcohol thus obtained was subjected<br>
for lipase-mediated transesterification in the same pot.<br>
4. Lipase-mediated transesterification of racemic alcohols were carried out at room<br>
temperature for 4-24 hours.<br>
5. Filtration followed by concentration of filtrate leaves the oily residue, which was<br>
purified by column chromatography to separate the enantiopure alcohol and<br>
acetate.<br>
6. Various solvents like hexane, diisopropyl ether, t-butylmethyl ether,<br>
tetrahydrofuran, and toluene were employed.<br>
7. Acetylating agents such as vinyl acetate and isopropenyl acetate were used for<br>
acetylation.<br>
7. Different Upases like Pseudomonas cepacia lipase (Amano PS), immobilized<br>
lipase PS-Amano C, PS-Amano D, Pseudomonas fluorescence were screened for<br>
the enzymatic resolution.<br>
9. Different substituted acetophenones were studied for this one-pot reaction<br>
process.<br>
10. The neutral alumina and lipase used were recycled for one-pot transesterification.<br>
11. Absolute configuration of chiral alcohol and acetate were ascertained by the<br>
value of optical rotation.<br>
12. The enantiomeric excess was determined by HPLC employing chiral columns.<br>

General procedure for hydrolysis of acetate to alcohol (A): To a solution of acetate 3<br>
(3 mmol) in 30 mL of methanol was added K2CO3 (10 mmol) and stirred at room<br>
temperature for 6 hrs. After complete hydrolysis of ester as indicated by TLC, the<br>
reaction mixture was subjected to filtration. The residue is treated with ethyl acetate<br>
(2x15ml). The organic layers were combined and solvents were evaporated to get the<br>
corresponding alcohol in almost quantitative yields (98%).<br>
Racemic alcohol (2a-i):<br>
The racemic alcohols were prepared by sodium borohydride reduction of the<br>
ketone in methanol, as an authentic sample for comparison on HPLC.<br>
Racemic acetate (3a-i):<br>
The racemic acetates were prepared by treating the racemic alcohol with acetic<br>
anhydride in presence of triethyl amine and catalytic amount of DMAP, as an authentic<br>
sample for comparison on HPLC.<br>
The main advantages of the present invention ?re:<br>
Reduction reaction leading to chirally pure intermediates is most frequently used<br>
transformation in organic synthesis. Enantiopure secondary alcohols are important chiral<br>
auxiliaries in organic synthesis. These types of chiral secondary alcohols are found in<br>
many naturally occurring biologically active compounds. In recent years there has been<br>
demand for the chiral secondary alcohols, which are found in number of biologically<br>
active intermediates.<br>
Optically pure secondary alcohols have been obtained in good yields and high<br>
enantiomeric excess by one-pot reduction of ketones followed by lipase-mediated<br>
transesterification. The faster reaction rates with high selectivity in organic media like<br>
hexane and environmentally acceptable reaction conditions provides a practical in situ<br>
biocatalytic resolution process of the secondary alcohols from their carbonyl precursors<br>
under mild conditions.<br><br><br><br>
