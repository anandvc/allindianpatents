				<td>PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF HETEROAROMATIC NTTRILES, IMPROVED CATALYST THEREFOR AND A PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF SATO IMPROVED CATALYST<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of heteroaromatic nitriles by the selective ammoxidation of the corresponding alkyl substituted pyridine. More particularly, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a heteroaromatic nitrile by reacting the corresponding alkyl substituted pyridine with ammonia and molecular oxygen and/or air in gas phase over an improved catalyst. The present invention also relates to such improved catalyst useful in the preparation of heteroaromatic nitriles and to a process for the preparation thereof. Background of the invention<br>
Heteroaromatic nitriles are valuable Intermediates used in the preparation of a wide range of medicines and agro-chemicals. Several processes are known in the art for the production of heteroaromatic nitrile from the corresponding alkyl substituted pyridine by reacting the alkyl substituted pyridine with ammonia and oxygen and/or air at elevated temperature in the gas phase. The prior art processes differ from each other in respect of the reaction conditions and/or the catalyst used. Generally, only those catalysts, which show good selectivity and high space time yield are suitable for use on an industrial scale.<br>
A significant problem in prior art ammoxidation processes used for the preparation of heteroaromatic nitriles is that they require reaction gases, which are greatly diluted with air. As a result, the space time yield is very low resulting in lower production of the desired nitriles. Another problem faced in processes where excess oxygen is used is the formation of undesirable byproducts rather than the desired nitriles due to the combustion of organic reactant and ammonia. This adds to process cost as more raw materials are required to produce a given amount of nitrile and also larger capital investment is required for a plant for a given capacity.<br>
It is therefore important and essential to develop a catalyst and a process for the ammoxidation of alkyl substituted pyridine to the corresponding heteroaromatic nitrile, which provides an improved selectivity as well as productivity for the desired heteroaromatic nitriles. Description of prior art<br>
Several processes for the preparation of heteroaromatic nitriles by catalytic ammoxidation of corresponding alkyl substituted pyridines with ammonia and oxygen and/or air in gas phase are reported in the art. US Patent No. 2592123 discloses a molybdenum oxide catalyst for the preparation of cyanopyridine at a temperature of over 410°C. The disadvantages<br>
of this process are the high reaction temperature which is not suitable for industrial production and also low yield of cyanopyridine. Another disadvantage of this process is that the catalyst gets deactivated in the course of time during reaction necessitating periodic regeneration resulting in higher production costs. US Patent No. 2839535 discloses a vanadium oxide catalyst applied to pretreated alumina for the preparation of cyanopyridines. In the process of this patent the treatment of Alumina is done at a temperature of 1100° to 1350°C, which makes the process of catalyst preparation unsuitable.<br>
European Patent No. 0037123 uses a catalyst comprised of vanadium, antimony and uranium or chromium oxides mixed with alumina. The required calcination temperature for the catalyst is 1300°C, which is again not suitable for industrial operatioa The process of this patent also requires that the reaction gases be diluted with air, thereby resulting in lower productivity and very high uncondensable gaseous effluent. US Patent No. 3,927,007 discloses a catalyst produced by pre-treating mixtures containing antimony and vanadium and at least one of the elements iron, copper, titanium, cobalt, manganese and nickel and optionally a carrier substance by heating to a temperatures of 600 to 1100°C in the presence of oxygen. While the process of this patent results in high space time yields, the selectivity is unsatisfactory. US Patent No. 3,297,587 discloses in borophosphate catalysts activated with molybdenum, bismuth, vanadium,<br>
iron or cobalt. The catalyst of this process are unsuitable since it is partly split into boric acid and phosphoric acid. US Patent No. 2510605 discloses a catalyst containing vanadium, molybdenum and phosphorous with alumina as a carrier. While the yield is reported to be good at 450°C, the high reaction temperature and high dilution of feed with air makes this process industrially undesirable.<br>
European Patent No. 0253360 discloses vanadium, phosphorous and antimony oxides in combination as catalyst for the ammoxidation at a reaction temperature in the range of 420 -430°C. Again, the high operating temperature is a serious limitation in terms of industrial operation. US Patent No. 5,910,465 discloses the ammoxidation of picolines over a multi-component catalyst comprising of vanadium, phosphorous, titanium or aluminium oxide with or without bismuth oxide. The catalyst is reduced at 450°C before the reactants are passed over the catalyst. US Patent No. 3,970,657 discloses the use of V2O5 + MoO3 + P2O5 + MnSO4 with titanium dioxide. The conversion level of 3-picoline claimed in this disclosure is in the range of 52% and selectivity of upto 83%. The low conversion and selectivity levels render this process unattractive. US Patent No. 5,658,844 discloses the use of vanadium, antimony, silica and titanium dioxide with one or more alkali metals.<br>
US Patent No, 4057552 discloses the use of a fluidlzed bed reactor. In this disclosure, a part of the spent catalyst is withdrawn from the ronetor niul volnillc components are removed from the catalyst by stripping. The spent catalyst is then oxidized by molecular oxygen through regeneration and the regenerated catalyst is re-circulated into the reactor. The reaction protocol of this process is complicated and the selectivity of 3-cyanopyridine is as low as 15%.<br>
Some of the problems associated with the prior art are overcome by the process disclosed in the applicants copending patent application No. 936/DEL/2001. The process of this application discloses the preparation of a heteroaromatic nitrile from the corresponding alkyl pyridine by contacting the alkyl pyridine with ammonia and an oxygen source in the presence of a catalyst comprising an active component consisting of oxides of vanadium and antimony and at least one promoter selected from chromium, molybdenum, cobalt and manganese oxides and any mixture thereof provided on a support. The oxygen source is preferably air. However, this process requires reaction gases to be highly diluted with air which results in lower productivity and high uncondensable gaseous effluents.<br>
As can be seen, prior art processes suffer from several problems such as high reaction temperature, low yield and selectivity for the desired heteroaromatic nitrile, requirement of excess air, catalyst deactivation and other operational difficulties. Another significant problem of vanadium oxide catalysts is their strong catalytic activity resulting in the dealkylation or cleavage of the heteroaromatic ring thereby reducing the yield and selectivity of the desired nitriles. Objects of the invention<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a process for the production of heteroaromatic nitriles by the amnioxidation of the corresponding alkyl substituted pyridines with ammonia and oxygen and/or air which ensures higher selectivity of the desired product at low temperature.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a process for the production of heteroaromatic nitriles by the amnioxidation of the corresponding alkyl substituted pyridines with ammonia and oxygen and/or air in the presence of an improved catalyst, thereby ensuring higher selectivity of the desired product at low temperature.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the production of heteroaromatic nitriles by the amnioxidation of the corresponding alkyl substituted pyridines with ammonia where the amount of oxygen and/or air hi the feed is kept at a minimum in order to improve the productivity at industrial scale.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for making an improved catalyst used in the manufacture of heteroaromatic nitriles whose preparation is comparatively simple and which provides high selectivities of the desired products.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a process for the preparation of an improved catalyst for the ammoxidation of an alkyl substituted pyridine to the corresponding heteroaromatic nitrile, in which catalyst can be used nl lower reaction temperature  and does not require frequent regeneratioa Summary of the invention<br>

Preparation of Catalyst Example 1<br>
320 gm of oxalic acid was charged in 3600 ml DM water in a three neck round bottom flask fitted with thermowell and a mechanical stirrer. The temperature was slowly raised to 70°C with the help of water bath. 134 gm of V2O5 was added while maintaining the mass temperature below SOT. 400 gm SbzOs was then added at a temperature of 75-80°C. The mass was maintained at this temperature for 15-30 minutes. 180 gm of orthophosphoric acid was then added while maintaining the same temperature. This mixture was then held for approximately 1 hr. 710 gm TiO2 (anatase) (S.A.
The extruded caUtlynt wan Initially calcined In air tit IOO"(J lor M hour*. The temperature was then slowly raised at the rate of 50°C/hr till a temperature of 250°C was attained. The temperature was then raised at the rate of 100°C/hr till a temperature of 530°C was attained. The temperature level was maintained for 2 hours, and then raised at the rate of 100°C/hr till a temperature of 710°C temperature was reached. The extrudate was maintained at this temperature for 3 hours. The catalyst was then discharged by cooling below 60°C. The final catalyst has a surface area 3-5 m2/gm.<br>
Experimental Set-up<br>
The above prepared catalyst was mixed with/without inert and packed in a 1 meter/5 meter long, 31 mm ID stainless steel reactor mounted on a tubular electrical furnace. A jacket with cooling arrangement device was provided in the reactor to control the catalyst bed temperature. Measured amount of feeds were separately pre-heated and mixed In a preheating zone before entering into the catalyst bed. Some inert was packed in the preheating zone to ensure the proper mixing of the feed. The temperature of the pre-mixing zone was kept at approximately 250-310°C. The product vapour were scrubbed through a series of water scrubbers connected at the reactor's outlet to avoid any loss of condensable product. The reaction product samples were analyzed periodically. Example 2<br>
A gaseous mixture of 3-methyl pyridine, ammonia, steam and air (Mole ratio = 1:3:8:15) was fed in the reactor following the procedure described above at a space velocity (At NTP) of 1000 hr"1 at 360±10°C temperature. The water scrubbed reaction product was analysed by Gas Chromatography under stabilized process conditions. 72.0% conversion of 3-methyl pyridine with 65.0% yield and 90.28% selectivity of 3-cyano pyridine was achieved. Example 3<br>
A gaseous mixture of 4-methyl pyridine, ammonia, steam and air (Molar ratio 1:3.5:9:14) was fed in the reactor following the procedure described above at a space velocity of 1000 hr"1 at 360+10°C temperature. The water scrubbed reaction product was analyzed by GC under stabilized process conditions. 80.0% conversion of 4-methyl pyridine with 73.0% yield &amp; 91.25% selectivity of 4-cyanopyridine was achieved. Example 4<br>
The same procedure as in Example 3 was carried out. Mix picoline containing (85% beta pic, 9% gnmmn pic mid rout higher pyridine hases) was used ( instend of 1-molhyl pyrlclliip) at 360+10°C. 77.0% average conversion of mix picoline .vith 64% yield and 90.14% combined selectivity of 3-cyano pyridine and 4-cyano pyridine was achieved. Example 5<br>
A gaseous mixture of 2-methyl pyridine, ammonia, steam and air (Molar ratio 1:2.5:5:16) was fed in the reactor following the procedure described as above at space velocity 1500 hr"1 at 360+10°C temperature. The water scrubbed reaction product was analyzed by G.C. under stabilized process conditions. 72.6% conversion of 2-methyl pyridine with 48.2% yield<br>
and 66.39% selectivity of 2-cyanopyridine was achieved,  Yield and selectivity of 2-cyanopyridine was comparatively low because of the formation of pyridine. Example 6<br>
To test the viability of the process on industrial scale, experiments were carried out for longer duration in a reactor 5 times longer than the reactor used in Example 2 with similar ID. Other process conditions were kept same as in Example 2. Reaction was performed upto 800 hrs. Reaction samples were monitored periodically. The conversion of beta picoline at initial hours was 75.0% with 66.0% yield and 88.0% selectivity of 3-cyano pyridine whereas after 800 hrs of reaction, 73.1% conversion with 66.1% yield and 90.42% selectivity of 3-cyanopyridine was achieved.<br>
The experimental results above show there is no deterioration in yield and selectivity of the desired product with time end that after stubilization, performance of the catalyst Improves. Based on the above facts, it is evident that the catalyst of the present invention has a very high life and is suitable for the commercial production of heteroamutle nitrills,<br><br><br>
