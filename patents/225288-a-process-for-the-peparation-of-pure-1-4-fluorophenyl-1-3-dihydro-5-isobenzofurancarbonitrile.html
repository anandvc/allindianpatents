				<td>PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF A CYANOISGBEWZQFURAN<br>
The present invention concerns a process for the preparation, with<br>
a sole series of reactions, of pure 1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-5-<br>
isobenzofurancarbonitrile and for its conversion into the 1-[(3-<br>
(dimethylamino)propyl]-1-(4-fluoropheny!)-1,3-dihydro-5-<br>
isobenzofurancarbonitrile and its pharmaceutical acceptable salt.<br>
Said cyano-isobenzofuran, 1-[(3-(dimethylamino)propy!]-1-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-5-isobenzo furancarbonitrile, represented by the<br>
formula A<br>
(Figure Removed)  known with its International Non-proprietary Name "citalopram" is an active<br>
principle of drugs used, in form of its hydrobromide, for the preparation of<br>
pharmaceuticai compositions for the treatment of depression.<br>
Citalopram was described for the first time in the Belgian patent<br>
850,401 (corresponding to US 4,136,193) and many methods for its<br>
preparation have been patented.<br>
Document US 4,136,193 discloses a family of compounds of<br>
formula A'<br>
N(CH3)2<br>
(A1)<br>
wherein RI and R2 represent each a halogen, a trifluoromethyl group, a<br>
cyano group or a group R-CO- in which R is CrC4 alkyl. According to said<br>
document, the compounds of formula A' may be prepared by reaction of a<br>
compound of formula B'<br>
(Figure Removed) wherein R^ and R2 are as defined above, with a 3-(dimethylamino)propyl<br>
halide in the presence of a base. The same document does not say how<br>
the compounds of formula B' in which RI is cyano and RZ is fluoro are<br>
prepared, but in two examples it provides the preparation of a compound<br>
of formula B1, in which RI is bromo and Ra is fluoro, by reaction of 5-<br>
bromophthalide with 4-fluorophenyl magnesium bromide, reduction of 3-<br>
hydroxymethyl-4-(4-fluorobenzoyl)bromobenzene thus obtained with<br>
lithium aluminium hydride and cyclization of the diol thus obtained of<br>
formula C'<br>
(Figure Removed) wherein R-i is bromo and R2 is fluoro, with 60% phosphoric acid. From this<br>
document an ordinary expert infers that the method for the preparation of<br>
the compounds of formula A1 is of general character and that the reaction<br>
with 4-fluorophenyl magnesium bromide may be performed on the 5-<br>
cyanophthalide too.<br>
In fact, EP 171,943 discloses a method of synthesis which uses two<br>
Grignard reactions starting from 5-cyanophthalide, the first one being with<br>
4-flourophenyl magnesium bromide and the second, on the magnesium<br>
derivative obtained, with 3-(dimethylamino)propyl magnesium chloride to<br>
obtain a diol, precursor of citalopram, of formula D<br>
(Figure Removed) <br><br>
which is cyclized to citalopram.<br>
Analogously, the document WO 98/19511 (corresponding to US<br>
6,291,689) discloses a process wherein the 3-hydroxymethyl-4-(4-<br>
fluorobenzoyl)benzonitrile is reduced with sodium borohydride to obtain<br>
the diol of formula C1, wherein R-i is cyano and Ra is fluoro, which is<br>
cyclized to 1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofuran carbonitrile in<br>
its turn converted to citalopram by reaction with 3-(dimethylamino)propyl<br>
chloride in the presence of a base. According to this document, the<br>
process may be carried out by isolating the intermediates or without<br>
isolating them, but said document does not give any information on how to<br>
carry out the process in a sole operation.<br>
Furthermore, the process described in WO 98/19511, which<br>
substantially overlaps that disclosed in the preceding documents BE<br>
850,401 and US 4,136,193, provides 1 -(4-fluorophenyl)- 1,3-dihydro-5-<br>
isobenzofurancarbonitrile (compound of formula B' in which RI = CN and<br>
R2 = F) in a yield of 29% only.<br>
It has been hypothesized and experimentally demonstrated that the<br>
reaction of 4-fluorophenyl magnesium bromide with 5-cyanophthalide<br>
leads to a mixture in which, beside the desired 3-hydroxymethyl-4-(4~<br>
fluorobenzoyl)benzonitrile, the 3-hydroxymethyl-4-[bis(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)hydrojcymethyl]benzonitrile is present in not negligible<br>
amounts. In the subsequent cycllzation this by-product, which remains<br>
unaltered during the reduction, for example with LiAIH4 or NaBH4l gives<br>
the 1,1-bis(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofurancarbonitrile which,<br>
being difficulty separable from the intermediate 1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-<br>
dihydro-5-isobenzofurancarbonitrile, involves noteworthy problems in the<br>
synthesis of the final citalopram. The confirmation of the formation of the<br>
above-mentioned by-products was possible by treatment of 5-<br>
cyanophthalide with an excess of 4-fluorophenyl magnesium bromide<br>
which, by favouring the formation of the 3-hydroxymethyl-4-[bis(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)hydroxymethyl] benzonitrile, allowed the isolation and the<br>
characterization of this by-product. The same principle has been applied to<br>
the preparation of 1,1-bis(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-5-<br>
isobenzofurancarbonitrile which has thus been isolated and characterized.<br>
Through the study of the solubility of 1,1-bis(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-5-<br>
isobenzofurancarbonitrile and of the 1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-5-<br>
isobenzofurancarbonitrile, it was possible to succeed in the separation of<br>
the two products in the course of the synthesis of citalopram starting from<br>
5-cyanophthalide.<br>
In particular, thanks to the identification of the by-products, it has<br>
been found that, by operating according to Example 3 of BE 850,401 (US<br>
4,036,193), starting from 5-cyanophthalide, after the reaction with 4-<br>
fiuorophenyl magnesium halide, the subsequent reduction to diol (C)<br>
and the cyclization to 1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-5-<br>
isobenzofurancsrbonitrile (B)<br>
it is possible to isolate the mixture containing the 1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-<br>
dihydro-5-isobenzofurancarbonitrile and the 1,1-bis-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-<br>
dihydro-5-isobenzofuran carbonitrile and to treat said mixture with a<br>
solvent capable of dissolving the 1,1-bis-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-5-<br>
isobenzofurancarbonitrile under condition in which 1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-<br>
dihydro-5-isobenzofurancarbonitrile is practically insoluble, for example<br>
with isopropanol or with methyl-f-butylether. Under these conditions, the<br>
pure 1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofurancarbonitrile (B) is<br>
recovered in very high yields while the by-product 1,1-bis-(4-fluorophenyl)-<br>
1,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofurancarbonitrile remains in solution and is thus<br>
eliminated.<br>
The reaction sequence takes place according to Scheme 1 below,<br>
wherein a preferred embodiment is illustrated.<br>
From 1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofurancarbonitrile<br>
thus obtained, by reaction with a 3-(dimethylamin6)propyl halide in the<br>
presence of a condensing agent such as an alkaline metal, for example<br>
sodium amide or potassium amide, butyl lithium, phenyl lithium, sodium<br>
hydride and the like, as described in BE 850,401 (US 4,136,193), it is<br>
possible to obtain the citalopram in a high degree of purity in form of free<br>
base or of one of its non toxic acid addition salts.<br>
The expressions "pure citalopram" and "citalopram at high purity<br>
degree" indicate citalopram or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof,<br>
in particular the hydrobromide, in which the 1,1-bis(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-<br>
dihydro-5-isobenzofurancarbonitrile is not detectable in the NMR spectrum<br>
obtained with a Bruker AMX 400 MHz apparatus.<br>
The terms "soluble" and "insoluble" and the expression "capable of<br>
dissolving" indicate a solubility degree of the above compounds which<br>
allows an average skilled in the art to dissolve a product under normal<br>
conditions, namely at a reasonable concentration and temperature or to<br>
consider that, at said reasonable concentration and temperature said<br>
product does not dissolve, taking into account that in the case of 1-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofurancarbonitrile and of 1,1'-bis(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofurancarbonitrile it is a matter of<br>
evaluating a difference of solubility between the two compounds. In an<br>
indicative but not limiting manner it may be considered that a solvent is<br>
suitable to the separation of the two compounds if, in said solvent, the<br>
1,1 '-bis(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofurancarbonitrile is "very<br>
soluble", "soluble" or "fairly soluble" according to the criteria of the<br>
European Pharmacopea or of the United States Pharmacopea (DSP)<br>
while, in the same solvent, the 1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-5-<br>
isobenzofurancarbonitrile is "very slightly soluble" or "practically insoluble".<br>
Figure 1 illustrates the characteristics of the 3-hydroxymethyl-4-<br>
[bis(4-fluorophenyl)hydroxymethyl]benzonitrile in the 1H-NMR and 13CNMR<br>
spectra obtained with a Bruker AMX 400 MHz apparatus.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates the characteristics of the 1,1-bis(4-fluorophenyl)-<br>
1,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofurancarbonitrile in the 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR<br>
spectra obtained with a Bruker AMX 400 MHz apparatus.<br>
(Figure Removed) Figure 3 illustrates the characteristics of the pure 1-(4-fluorophenyl)-<br>
1,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofurancarbonitrile in the 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR<br>
spectra obtained with a Bruker AMX 400 MHz apparatus.<br>
Thus, it is an object of the present invention to provide a process for<br>
the preparation of 1-(4-fluoropheny!)-1,3-dihydro-5-<br>
isobenzofurancarbonitrile which comprises:<br>
(a) reacting 5-cyanophthalide with a 4-fluorophenyl magnesium<br>
halide;<br>
(b) treating the mixture thus obtained, containing the 3-<br>
hydroxymethyl-4-(4-fluoro- benzoyl)benzonitrile and the 3-hydroxymethyl-<br>
4-[bis-(4-fluorophenyl)hydroxymethyl] benzonitrile; with an agent reducing<br>
ketones to alcohols;<br>
(c) submitting the mixture thus obtained, containing the 3-<br>
hydroxymethyl-4-[(4-fluorophenyl)hydroxymethyl]benzonitrile (C) and the<br>
3-hydroxymethyl-4-[bis-(4-fluoro- phenyl)hydroxymethyl]benzonitrile, to a<br>
cyclization reaction and isolating a. mixture containing the 1-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofurancarbonitrile and the 1-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofurancarbonitrile (B) and the 1,1-<br>
bis(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofurancarbonitrile;<br>
(d) treating the mixture thus obtained with a solvent capable of<br>
dissolving the 1,1-bis(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-5-<br>
isobenzofurancarbonitrile and in which the 1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-<br>
5-isobenzofurancarbonitrile (B) is insoluble and recovering the pure 1-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofurancarbonitrile (B).<br>
Steps (a), (b) and (c) are carried out without isolating the intermediate<br>
compounds according to known literature methods, for example according<br>
to the method cited in US 4,136,193 and specifically described, starting<br>
from 5-bromophthalide, in examples 1 and 3 of said document.<br>
In particular, step (a), consisting of the treatment of 5-cyanophthalide<br>
with a 4-fluorophenyimagnesium halide, occurs according to a classical<br>
Grignard reaction procedure, for example under the conditions described<br>
in Example 1 of US 4,136,193 for the 5-bromophthalide, by treating<br>
1,054-1,35 equivalents of a Grignard solution, titred at 15+20%, said<br>
solution being prepared from p-fiuorobromobenzene and magnesium<br>
turnings in an ether, for example in tetrahydrofuran, with 5-cyanophthalide<br>
and by adding said Grignard reagent in the amount capable of consuming<br>
practically the whole starting 5-cyanophthalide. In practice, the operator<br>
controls the course of the reaction by HPLC [column: Develosil C18 4.6 x<br>
250 mm, 5^; DETECTOR: UV 240nm; FLOW: 1.5 ml/min; GRADIENT: A:<br>
aqueous NH4H2P04 + H3PO4 at pH = 2.85 / B: CH3CN/H2O = 9/1 (v/v)]<br>
and stops it when 2+3% of unreacted 5-cyanophthalide remains. The<br>
product thus obtained is directly submitted to the next step (b) consinsting<br>
of a reduction with an agent reducing ketones to alcohols for example with<br>
NaBH4l or with LiAIH4 as described in Example 3 of US 4,136,193, to<br>
obtain the corresponding 3-hydroxymethyl-4-[(4-fluorophenyl)<br>
hydroxymethyl]benzonitrile.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, which allows the large scale<br>
preparation under conditions of safety, the reduction is carried out with an<br>
aqueous solution of NaBH4 and sodium hydroxide. Said aqueous solution<br>
is added at a temperature not higher than 15°C and the reaction is<br>
complete at the end of the addition. Thus, it is sufficient to eliminate the<br>
aqueous phase, to evaporate the organic solvent and to submit the<br>
residue to the subsequent step (c).<br>
Step (c), consisting of the diol cyclization, is conducted by treating the<br>
material obtained at the end of step (b) with 60% phosphoric acid as<br>
described in Example 1 of US 4,136,193 for the corresponding 3-<br>
hydroxymethyl-4-[(4-fluorophenyl)hydroxymethyl]-bromobenzene.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the method described in US<br>
4,136,193 is rendered easier by dissolving the material obtained at the<br>
end of step (b) in an organic solvent, preferably ethyl acetate or<br>
tetrahydrofuran, and by carrying out the reaction with 60% phosphoric acid<br>
in a biphasic system, thus avoiding the formation of waxy residues which<br>
are difficult to treat. In practice, the residue obtained according to the<br>
preferred mode of conducting step (b) is dissolved in ethyl acetate and,<br>
after the addition of 60% phosphoric acid, the reaction is carried out in a<br>
biphasic, for example water/ethyl acetate, system.<br>
In step (d), the crude material thus obtained, containing the 1-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofurancarbonitrile (B) and the 1,1-<br>
bis(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofurancarbonitrile is treated with<br>
a solvent capable of dissolving the 1,1-bis(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-5-<br>
isobenzofurancarbonitrile under conditions in which the 1-(4-fluorophenyl)-<br>
1,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofurancarbonitrile (B) is practically insoluble, for<br>
example with isopropanol or with methyl-f-butylether.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the process of the present<br>
invention is carried out "one-pot", i.e. without isolating the intermediate<br>
products, until a 1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofurancarbonitrile<br>
practically devoid of 1,1-bis(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-5-<br>
isobenzofurancarbonitrile is obtained, said 1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-<br>
5-isobenzofurancarbonitrile being subsequently converted into citalopram.<br>
In practice, a Grignard solution is prepared by adding a solution of 4-<br>
fluorobromobenzene in tetrahydrofuran to magnesium turnings in the<br>
presence of traces of iodine at a temperature of about 70°C and, after<br>
about 30 minutes, at the same temperature, the solution is added<br>
portionwise to a suspension of 5-cyanophthalide in tetrahydrofuran at -<br>
20-5-0°C, preferably at -10-5-0°C. At the end of the reaction, namely when<br>
less than 5% of the starting 5-cyanophthalide is present, the magnesium<br>
derivative is decomposed with water or, better, with an aqueous solution of<br>
ammonium chloride and the cold tetrahydrofuranic solution, containing the<br>
3-hydroxymethyl-4-(4-fluorobenzoyl)benzonitrile and the 3-hydroxymethyl-<br>
4[bis(4-fluorophenyl)hydroxymethyl]benzonitrile, is treated with an<br>
aqueous solution of NaBH4 and of NaOH.<br>
The obtained mixture, containing the 3-hydroxymethyl-4-[(4-<br>
fiuorophenyl)hydroxy methyljbenzonitrile (C) and the 3-hydroxymethyl-4-<br>
[bis(4-fluorophenyl)hydroxymethyl] benzonitrile, is extracted with ethyl<br>
acetate. The organic phase is concentrated, the residue is taken up with<br>
an organic solvent, preferably with ethyl acetate, and the solution is<br>
treated with 60% phosphoric acid and heated. At the end of the reaction,<br>
after separation of the phases, the organic phase, containing the 1-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofurancarbonitrile and the 1,1-bis-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-5-iso benzofurancarbonitrile, is washed with<br>
water, decolorized with activated charcoal and concentrated under<br>
vacuum. The oily residue is treated with the selected solvent, preferably<br>
with isopropanol or with methyl-f-butylether, then the solvent is evaporated<br>
under vacuum. If needed, the operation of treatment with the solvent and<br>
of subsequent evaporation is repeated several times until, by taking up<br>
with the solvent, a crystalline suspension consisting of pure 1-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofurancarbonitrile (B) is obtained. This<br>
compound is isolated in a 70+75% yield, calculated in respect of the<br>
starting 5-cyanophthalide, by simple filtration. In general, the product thus<br>
obtained, having a purity higher than 98%, contains the 1,1-bis(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofurancarbonitrile in a percent lower<br>
than 0.5%, thus allowing the subsequent preparation of a citalopram with a<br>
high degree of purity, or of pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, by<br>
treatment with a 3-(dimethylamino)propyl halide in the presence of a basic<br>
condensing agent. This mode of operating is illustrated, in a preferred<br>
aspect thereof, in Scheme 2 below.<br>
The 1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofurancarbonitrile<br>
containing the 1,1-bis(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-5-<br>
isobenzofurancarbonitrile in a percent lower than 0.5% is a new product<br>
which represents a further object of the present invention.<br>
The pure 1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofurancarbonitrile<br>
(B) obtained at the end of steps (a)-(d) above may be further made to<br>
react with a 3-(dimethylamino) propyl halide in the presence of a basic<br>
condensing agent to isolate citalopram at a high purity degree, or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in yields which are higher than<br>
those obtained with any other known process using 5-cyanophthalide as<br>
starting material.<br>
Thus, it is another object of the present invention to provide a<br>
process for the preparation of citalopram or of a pharmaceuticaily<br>
acceptable salt thereof, which comprises:<br>
(a) reacting 5-cyanophthalide with a 4-fluorophenyl magnesium<br>
halide;<br>
(b) treating the mixture thus obtained, containing the 3-<br>
hydroxymethyl-4-(4-fluoro benzoyl)benzonitrile and the 3-hydroxymethyl-4-<br>
[bis-(4-fluorophenyl)hydroxymethyl] benzonitrile with a reducing agent of<br>
ketones to alcohols;<br>
(c) submitting the mixture thus obtained, containing the 3-<br>
hydroxymethyl-4-[(4-fluorophenyl)hydroxymethyl]benzonitriIe (C) and the<br>
3-hydroxymethyl-4-[bis-(4-fluoro phenyl)hydroxymethyl]benzonitrile to a<br>
cyclization and isolating a mixture containing the 1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-<br>
dihydro-5-isobenzofurancarbonitrile (B) and the 1,1-bis(4-fluoro phenyl)-<br>
1,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofurancarbonitrile;<br>
(d) treating the mixture thus obtained with a solvent capable of<br>
dissolving the 1,1-bis(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-5-<br>
isobenzofurancarbonitrile and in which the 1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-<br>
5-isobenzofurancarbonitrile (B) is insoluble and recovering the pure 1-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofurancarbonitriIe (B);<br>
(e) treating the pure 1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-5-<br>
isobenzofurancarbonitrile (B) with a 3-(dimetylamino)propyl halide in the.<br>
presence of a basic condensing agent and isolating citalopram as free<br>
base or as a pharmaceuticaily acceptable salt thereof.<br>
Steps (a)-(d) are carried out as described above and the pure 1-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofurancarbonitrile (B) obtained at the<br>
end of step (d) is submitted to the subsequent step (e).<br>
In step (e), the chloride, the bromide or the iodide may indifferently<br>
be used as halide, the chloride being preferred.<br>
As a condensing basic agent, anyone of the bases commonly used<br>
in the alkylation reactions, such as sodium amide, potassium amide, butyl<br>
lithium, phenyl lithium or sodium hydride may be employed.<br>
(Figure Removed) The condensation is carried out in an inert solvent, preferably in<br>
dimethyl sulfoxide.<br>
Advantageously, the 1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-5-<br>
isobenzofurancarbonitrile (B) as obtained at the end of step (d) is<br>
dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, the solution thus obtained is added to a<br>
suspension of sodium hydride in dimethyl sulfoxide, the mixture is then<br>
treated with 3-(dimethylaminopropyl) chloride and the citalopram which<br>
forms is isolated according to the conventional methods, in form of free<br>
base or of a salt thereof.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, at the end of the reaction<br>
water is added, citalopram is extracted with ethyl acetate and, after<br>
suitable washings with water, the organic phase containing citalopram is<br>
concentrated to an oil, essentially consisting of citalopram base, which, by<br>
treatment with HBr in acetone, affords a citalopram hydrobromide wherein<br>
the 1,1-bis(4-fluorophenyi)-1,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofurancarbonitrile is not<br>
detectable in the NMR spectrum obtained with a Bruker AMX 400MHz<br>
apparatus. The product thus obtained may be subsequently purified<br>
according to known methods, for example by repeated washings with cold<br>
water.<br>
Thus, the process of the present invention allows the preparation of<br>
citalopram hydrobromide in yields much higher than those obtained by all<br>
of the methods employing the 5-cyanophthalide as starting material.<br>
Furthermore, by avoiding the use of intermediates containing a prcursor of<br>
the CN group, the process of the invention is easier to be carried out and<br>
affords a citalopram with high purity in very satisfactory yields.<br>
In the preparations given hereinbelow the by-products that form in<br>
the synthesis starting from 5-cyanophthalide are isolated. They represent<br>
the reference standards for the control of the process of the invention.<br>
The following examples illustrate the invention.<br>

= 9/1 (v/v)], the disappearance of 5-cyanophthalide is observed. When the<br>
reaction is over, 200 ml of a 15% aqueous solution of ammonium chloride<br>
are added, maintaining the temperature not higher than 30°C, then the<br>
phases are separated and the organic one is concentrated under vacuum<br>
to obtain 52 g of a yellow oil, the raw 3-hydroxymethyl-4-[bis-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)hydroxymethyl] benzonitrile, with a purity of 92.12%.<br>
(b) Purification<br>
In a 250-ml flask, 20 g of raw 3-hydroxymethyl-4-[bis(4-<br>
fluorophenyl) hydroxymethyljbenzonitrile obtained in the preceding<br>
synthesis and 100 ml of ethyl acetate are charged. The mixture is stirred<br>
until a solution is obtained, wherein 30 ml of silica gel 60 are added, then<br>
the solvent is evaporated under vacuum until a dry powder is obtained.<br>
Separately, a 5-cm diameter column is prepared with 300 ml of silica gel<br>
60 (particles 0 0.063-0.200 mm) for gravimetric column, using a mixture<br>
hexane/ethyl acetate 9/1 (v/v) as eluent. The product previously adsorbed<br>
on silica gel 60 is charged into the column prepared as described and is<br>
eluted with the mixture itself. The fractions containing the product are<br>
collected and concentrated under vacuum at 50°C with Rotavapor® (the<br>
solution is getting foaming, so that during the concentration must be taken<br>
the due precautions). The oily residue obtained is treated with 100 ml<br>
dichloromethane and the solution is concentrated to give 11.6 g of 3-<br>
hydroxymethyl-4-[bis(4-fluorophenyl)hydro)cymethy!]benzonitrile as white<br>
