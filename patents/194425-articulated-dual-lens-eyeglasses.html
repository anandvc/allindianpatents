Background of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to multi-component eyeglass frames. More particularly, the present invention relates to investment cast eyewear orbitals in an articulated eyeglass frame.<br>
A wide variety of improvements have been made in recent years in the eyewear field. For example, the unitary cylindrical lens was popularized by the Blades(r) (Oakley, Inc.) eyewear which incorporated, among others, the technology of United States Patent No. 4,859,048 to Jannard Toroidal unitary lens geometry having a constant horizontal radius throughout was introduced through a variety of products in the M Frame(r) line of eyeglasses, also produced by Oakley, Inc. See, e g., United States Patent No. 4,867,550 to Jannard. Various other improvements in eyewear systems are exemplified in United States Patent Nos. 4,674,851, 4,730,915, 4,824,233, 4,867,550, 5,054,903, 5,137,342, 5,208,614 and 5,249,001, all to Jannard, et al.<br>
The foregoing designs as well as other active sports eyeglasses on the market generally utilize a unitary lens or dual lenses formed from a polymer such as polycarbonate, which is mounted in a polymeric frame Alternatively, the prior art includes eyeglasses in which glass or polymeric lenses have been mounted in frames formed from thin metal sections such as metal wire.<br>
One continuing objective in the field of high quality eyewear, particularly that intended for use in high speed action sports, is minimizing distortion introduced by the eyewear Distortion may be introduced by any of a variety of influences, such as poor construction materials for the optical portion of the lens, and inferior polishing and/or molding techniques for the lens. In addition, optical distortion can result from the interaction of the lens with the frame, such as changes in the shape of the lens orbital<br>
The technology exists for satisfactorily minimizing distortion introduced by characteristics of the lens alone. However, the overall optical precision of active sports eyewear up to this point has been limited by the combination of the polymeric lens in a polymeric or flexible wire frame. Eyeglass systems thus formed are susceptible to bending and flexing due to a variety of environmental causes such as impact, storage induced and other external forces, forces resulting from the assembly process of the eyewear, and exposure to heat. Flexing of the lens or uncontrolled deviation of the orientation of one lens with respect to the other can undesirably change refractive properties of the eyeglasses, whether the lens is corrective (prescription) or non-corrective.<br>
Thus, there remains a need for a dimensionally stable support structure for eyeglass lenses, suitable for use with corrective and non-corrective lenses in rugged, high durability eyewear. Preferably, the eyewear remains aerodynamically suited for active sports such as high speed bicycle racing, skiing and the like, and weighs no more than necessary to accomplish the foregoing objectives.<br><br>

Summary of the Invention<br>
There is provided In accordance with one aspect of the present Invention an investment cast dimenslonally stable eyeglass frame. The frame comprises a first cast orbital, and a second cast orbital. A bridge is provided for connecting the first and second orbttab, and the first and second orbitals are plvotably connected to the bridge.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided an articulated dual lens eyeglass. The eyeglass comprises first and second orbttab, each orbital having a medial and a lateral zone. A medial connector is provided on the medial zone of each orbital, and a bridge is moveably connected to the medial connector on each orbital. Each orbital is moveable throughout a range of motion of no more than about 15° with respect to the bridge.<br>
Preferably, each of the first and second orbttab comprises an annular seat for receiving a lens. A lens retainer for retaining the lens in the annular seat is preferably also provided.<br>
Further features and advantages of the present invention wilI become apparent from the detailed description of preferred embodiments, which follows, when considered together with the accompanying drawings and claims.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
Referring to Figure 1, there Is disclosed one embodiment of an eyeglass prepared in accordance with the present Invention. The eyeglass 10 generally comprises a frame 12, which. In the Illustrated embodiment, supports a pair of lenses 14 and 16. Although the present invention will be described with reference to a dual lens system, it is to be understood that the methods and principles discussed herein are readily applicable to the production of frames for unitary lens eyeglass systems and protective goggle systems as well.<br>
The frame 12 generally comprises a first orbital 18 and a second orbital 20 for supporting the first lens 14 and second lens 16. Although the present invention will be disclosed in the context of a pair of orbitals 18 and 20 which surround the respective lenses, the principles of the present invention also apply to eyeglass systems In<br><br>
-3-<br>
which the frame only partially surrounds the lens or lenses, or contacts only one edge or a portion of one edge of the lens or each lens as well.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment, the orbitals 18 and 20 are connected by a bridge portion 22.<br>
The eyeglass 10 is also provided with a pair of generally rearwardly extending earstems 24 and 26 for retaining the eyeglass on the head of the wearer. In addition, an open region 28 is adapted to receive the nose of the wearer, as is understood in the art. Nose region 28 may optionally be provided with a nose piece, either connected to the lens orbitals 18 and 20, or the bridge 22, or directly to the lens(s) depending upon the particular embodiment. Alternatively, the nose piece may be formed by appropriately sculpting the medial edges of the orbitals and lower edge of the bridge, as in the illustiated embodiment.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, at least the orbitals 18 and 20, and optionally the bridge 22, as well as other components of the eyeglass system, are manufactured from a high structural integrity material and preferably through a casting process to optimize structural stability in at least the optical support portion of the final product The orbitals 18 and 20 can be separately formed and assembled later with a separately manufactured bridge 22, or the orbitals 18, 20 and bridge 22 can be integrally molded or cast as will be appreciated by one of skill in the art in view of the disclosure herein. Casting as disclosed herein desirably eliminates the need to bend metal parts as is done in the prior art methods of making and adjusting metal eyeglass frames.<br>
Earstems 24 and 26 may also be formed through the casting techniques disclosed herein; however, it has been determined by the present inventor that the earstems 24 and 26 are preferably constructed in a manner that permits at least medial and lateral direction flexibility, to enhance the comfort for the wearer and accommodate a variety of head widths Flexibility of the rearwardly extending ends of earstems 24 and 26 in the desired directions can be accomplished either through the use of flexible construction materials for the earstem as is known in the art, or through the use of relatively rigid earstems in combination with a spring, resilient hinge materials, or other techniques which can be devised to impart some flexibility and even a medial bias Preferably, earstems 24 and 26 are connected directly or indirectly to the orbitals 18 and 20 through the use of hinges. However, non-hinged flexible or inflexible connections may also be used as desired.<br>
Referring to Figure 2, there is disclosed a cross-section through the orbital 20 of the embodiment illustrated in Figure 1. In this embodiment, the orbital 20 is provided with an annular seat 30 for receiving the lens 16. The annular seat 30 in one embodiment is formed by the sidewall of a channel extending radially outwardly into the orbital 20 for surrounding the edge and a portion of the front and rear surface of the lens 16. In an embodiment having a radially outwardly extending channel for receiving the lens, access to the channel for installing the lens can be provided by bifurcating each orbital along a horizontal, vertical or other axis. The orbital sections can be recombined following insertion of the lens. Alternatively, the seat 30, as illustrated, is formed by the surface of an annular shelf for receiving the lens from the front or rear side of the glasses.<br>
The lens may be retained in the frame in any of a variety of manners. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, a lens retention structure 32 such as a lens retention ring 34 is provided for retaining the lens 16 in the seat 30. The lens retention ring 34 can be secured in position in any of a variety of ways, such as welding,<br><br>
-4-<br>
brazing, soldering, adhesives, other metallic bonding techniques, snap fit, threaded engagement, screws, or otherwise as will be understood to those of skill in the art.<br>
As an alternate to a lens retention ring 34, the lens retention structure 32 can be one or more projections extending from the orbital 20 in the direction of the optical zone of the lens, projections on the lens for engaging the orbital, or any of a variety of other structures which will be readily apparent to one of skill in the art in view of the disclosure herein. In one embodiment the lens retention structure 32 is permanently installed at the point of manufacture. Alternatively, the lens retention structure is provided with a snap in t erf it or other releasable retention feature to permit removal by the wearer such as to permit the wearer to exchange lenses.<br>
The lens can seat directly against the metal seat 30 and lens retention structure 32 Alternatively, a spacer such as a resilient gasket or substantially nonresilient pad can be positioned in between the lens and the seat 30 and/or retention structure 32, to provide a "floating" lens suspension system.<br>
Preferably the frame and optionally the earstems are manufactured through an investment casting technique. One benefit of investment casting is that a high degree of control can be achieved over the design, both structurally and aesthetically<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the surfaces of the lenses or optical zones lie on the surface of a solid geometric shape having a curve of substantially constant radius along what is the horizontal meridian of the eyeglasses Thus, for example, referring to Figure 3, the front surface of one embodiment of the eyeglass frame conforms generally to a curve 30 such as a base 4 curve The lens slot preferably conforms generally to a curve 32 such as a base 6, and the concave surface of the eyeglasses conforms generally to a curve 34 of base 8. Other base curves can be readily used if desired, such as to accommodate either prescription (corrective) lenses or noncorrective lenses.<br>
In a typical dual lens investment cast dimensionally stable eyeglass in accordance with the present invention, the overall arc length of the eyeglasses roughly from hinge to hinge is within the range of from about 5 1/2 inches to about 8.0 inches The maximum vertical height of the glasses through each of the right and left optical zones is typically within the range of from about 3/4 inch to about 2 1/2 inches. The arc length of each right and left lens in a dual lens system is typically within the range of from about 1 1/2 inches to about 3 inches. The narrowest vertical dimension of the eyeglass at the bridge is generally between about 1/8 inch or 1/4 inch and about 3/4 inch or greater depending upon materials and design variables.<br>
Referring to the fragmentary cross section shown in Figure 4, in a cast titanium embodiment, the cross sectional dimensions through a portion of the orbital are as follows The widest top to bottom dimension d1 is from about 1/16 inch to about 3/4 inch. The widest front to back dimension d2 is from about 1/8 inch to about 1/2 inch. The front to back dimension d3 at seat 30 is from about 1/32 inch to about 1/2 inch. The top to bottom dimension d4 at seat 30 is from about 1/32 inch to about 1/2 inch.<br>
In general, no portion of the orbital will have a cross sectional area that is less than the area achieved by the low end of the dimensions recited above. The bridge 22 generally has an even larger cross sectional area than the top or bottom sections of the orbital Thus, referring to Figure 5, in one embodiment of the invention, the bridge<br><br>
-5-<br>
22 has a height d5 of at least about 1/8 inch and a depth d6 of at least about 1/8 inch. The cross sectional area at the narrowest portion of the bridge is generally no less than approximately 0 002 square inches.<br>
Where the cross section through a segment of the orbital is non-circular, as in Figure 4, the length to diameter ratio can be standardized for comparison by calculating the cross sectional area and then converting that area to a circular configuration. The diameter of the circle having the same area as the orbital segment is then used in determining the length to diameter radio.<br>
Casting in accordance with the present invention permits relatively larger cross sectional areas (smaller length to diameter (Id) ratios) than the prior art wire frame glasses, thereby enhancing stability, l-d ratios may be conveniently reported as an average over a desirable length. This may be useful, for example, where the diameter or cross sectional area changes significantly along the circumferential arc of the orbital.<br>
For example, l.d ratios may conveniently be determined using a diameter based upon a 1/2 inch running average, one inch average or even 1/4 inch average or smaller, indicating that the diameter used in the l:d ratio is the average diameter along the specified length. The I d ratio can then be expressed using any hypothetical standard length, such as one inch to conveniently compare l.d ratios from one product to another.<br>
Alternatively, cast eyewear frames in accordance with the present invention can be characterized by the minimum cross sectional dimension. This may be convenient, for example, where irregular cross sectional configurations are involved. For example, the orbital cross section may have a generally V or "u" configuration, due to the groove for receiving the lens. The minimal cross sectional configuration may be through either of the legs of the u configuration, or through the bottom of the u configuration. In general, the smallest cross sectional dimensions through the orbital will be no less than about 0.020 inches average over a distance of no less than about 1/2 inch Preferably, the minimum 1/2 inch running average will be no less than about 0.030 inches, and, in some embodiments, the minimum cross sectional dimension will be as much as 0.075 inches or greater over a 1/2 inch length Portions of the eyeglass orbital will often be greatly in excess of the foregoing minimum dimensions, particularly in the region of the lateral and medial portions of the orbital. By expressing the minimum cross sectional dimension as an average minimum over a 1/2 inch length, it is contemplated that the cross sectional dimension at any specific point could neck down to a smaller cross sectional dimension than stated, although only for a relatively short distance along the orbital, so that the average cross sectional dimension over a 1(2 inch length will still meet the recited minimums.<br>
Relatively smaller cross sectional dimensions through portions of the eyeglass frame can be utilized with relatively higher rigidity construction materials as will be appreciated in view of the disclosure herein, or with glass lenses In polymeric lens systems, greater reliance will be placed upon the frame for imparting structural stability. That generally means thicker orbital segments will be desirable.<br>
In a dual lens system, the stability of one lens with respect to the other is strongly influenced by the design and material of the bridge portion 22. In an embodiment that is investment cast from a high titanium content material the cross section through the thinnest portion of the bridge will generally be no less than about 1/32 inch.<br><br>
-6-<br>
Frames such as those disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,611,371 to Fujino et al., which purports to disclose cast metal eyeglass parts, would if they could even be made as described, likely exhibit undesirably high flexibility. Those frames appear to use wire having about a 10*1 length to diameter ratio, and a cross sectional area on the order of about 0.8 mm2 In general, in an embodiment of the type illustrated in Figure 1, the portions of the orbitals above and below the lenses will have a length to diameter ratio over any one inch length of no higher than about 5-1.<br>
Any of a variety of materials can be utilized to produce a dimensionally stable eyewear system However, producing an eyeglass having sufficient dimensional stability using certain materials and techniques introduces excessive weight in the finished product, excessive manufacturing costs, or other undesirable circumstance. Thus, the selection of a particular technique or material can be optimized in accordance with the requirements of the product and manufacturer, in view of the disclosure herein.<br>
For example, a variety of steel alloys, such as chrome molybdenum, chromium nickel molybdenum, nickel molybdenum and chrome vanadium steel alloys can be formulated to exhibit good structural properties. Copper, aluminum and silver based alloys can also be used. Preferably, however, lightweight, high strength materials such as titanium a titanium-based alloy or titanium based metal matrix composite such as TI6AL4V, available from Timet Corp, are utilized in constructing the eyeglass orbitals of the present invention.<br>
The preferred alloy or metal exhibits relatively high strength and stiffness and relatively low weight. Certain copper, aluminum and silver alloys, depending upon temper treatment, have mechanical properties of ultimate strength, initial yield point and modulus of elasticity similar to titanium but differ more significantly in the strength to weight ratio<br>
In general, any investment castable metal or metal containing material is a candidate for use in connection with the present invention. Optimizing a particular metal or metal containing material can be done through routine experimentation by one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the disclosure contained herein. In addition to metal choice and dimensional choice, physical properties of the finished cast eyewear can be modified by post investment casting procedures, such as tempering, compaction, or others known in the art.<br>
Depending upon the construction material and the required physical characteristics of the finished product, any of a variety of construction techniques can be utilized to produce dimensionally stable eyewear. For example, modifications of machining techniques, casting and forging methods can be used. With respect to casting techniques, metal framed eyewear can be produced utilizing sand castings, permanent mold castings, dye castings or investment casting techniques.<br>
One preferred method for manufacturing the dimensionally stable eyewear or eyewear components in accordance with the present invention is investment casting. Investment casting of dimensionally stable metal eyewear components can be accomplished utilizing a ceramic mold. The mold is formed by pouring a slurry of a material such as a known mold forming refractory material around an orbital or eyeglass pattern, which is maintained in position within a flask as is understood in the investment casting art.<br><br>
-7-<br>
Following a preliminary drying, the mold is baked in an oven to melt the pattern, thereby leaving an empty mold cavity The investment mold is thereafter fired at a temperature which is appropriate for the metal to be used, and, while still hot, molten metal is poured into the mold and allowed to solidify. The mold is thereafter broken away from the casting to produce the cast orbital or eyeglass The cast component may thereafter be subject to post-casting operations such as sanding, polishing, grinding, or otherwise as desired to produce the finished product.<br>
The present inventor has determined that through the design flexibility available with investment cast metal parts, eyeglass frames can be constructed which maintain a relatively high dimensional stability, yet with the minimal amount of material necessary to achieve that stability. This is due to the opportunity to make complex curves, hollows and other surface contours which allow excess non-structural material to be eliminated. In addition, the eyeglass can be designed in a manner that simultaneously optimizes the aerodynamic properties of the finished eyeglass, and allows considerable aesthetic design flexibility. Sharp angles and other stress points can be minimized or eliminated, and an overall aesthetic appearance can be maintained.<br>
In addition to the conventional metals and metal alloys discussed above, the objectives of the present invention can be achieved through the use of metal matrix composites, metal-polymer blends and potentially purely polymeric compositions which exhibit sufficient structural integrity to accomplish the desired stabilizing results.<br>
Referring to Figures 6 through 9, there is disclosed an articulated eyeglass frame in accordance with the present invention. Although the embodiment discussed herein is a seven-piece system, the inventive concepts can readily be incorporated into eyeglass systems which have fewer or more components as will be apparent to those of skill in the art in view of the disclosure herein. In addition, all of the dimensions discussed in connection with previous embodiments also apply to the articulated embodiments with exceptions that will be apparent to those of skill in the art.<br>
Referring to Figure 6, there is disclosed an eyeglass 40 which comprises a first orbital 42 and a second orbital 44. First orbital 42 and second orbital 44 are connected to each other by way of a bridge 46.<br>
The first orbital 42 supports a first lens 48, and the second orbital 44 supports a second tens 50. First orbital 42 may be characterized as having a medial section 52 and a lateral section 54. Similarly, second orbital 44 may be characterized as having a medial section 56 and a lateral section 58.<br>
A first link 60 is connected to the lateral section 54 of first orbital 42. A second link 62 is connected to the lateral section 58 of second orbital 44. In the illustrated embodiment, the first link 60 and second link 62 extend generally rearwardly from the first and second orbitals 42 and 44<br>
A first earstem 64 is connected to first link 60 and a second earstem 66 is connected to second link 62. As illustrated, first and second earstems 64 and 66 extend generally rearwardly from the first and second links 60 and 62<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, each of the bridge 46, the first and second orbitals 42 and 44, the first and second links 60 and 62, and the first and second earstems 64 and 66 are separately formed. Each of these components is then connected together to produce the eyeglass system illustrated in Figure 6. Alternatively, the bridge 46 can be formed integrally with one or the other or both of orbital 42 and 44. As a further alternative,<br><br>
-8-<br>
the separate bridge 46 can be eliminated, such that first orbital 42 and second orbital 44 are connected directly together.<br>
First link 60 and second link 62 may in an alternate embodiment be deleted, such that first earstem 64 and second earstem 66 connect directly to first orbital 42 and second orbital 44, respectively Additional linkages may also be inserted, and pivotably or rigidly connected into place.<br>
Referring to Figure 7, the individual parts of a seven-component system are illustrated. The bridge 46 is provided with a first bridge connector 68 and a second bridge connector 70. As used herein, connector refers to one or more parts of a complementary two or more component connection system. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, first bridge connector 68 comprises a rearwardly extending flange 72 having an aperture 74 extending therethrough. The flange 72 is adapted to fit within a recess 76 in the medial section 52 of the first orbital 42 An aperture 82 extends through the recess 76 to form a first medial connector 78. The aperture 74 is positioned to coaxtally align with the aperture 82 when flange 72 is positioned within recess 76. A pin, screw, or other structure may then be placed through aperture 74 and aperture 82 to pivotably link the bridge 46 with the first orbital 42<br>
Alternatively, the first and second bridge connectors 68, 70 may be located an the orbitals 42, 44 respectively In this embodiment, the bridge 46 would have complimentary connector structure such as apertures as will be understood by those of skill in the art Similarly, the components of any of the other disclosed connectors may be reversed as will be understood by those of skill in the art.<br>
As will be understood by those of skill in the art in view of the disclosure herein, the foregoing cooperation between first bridge connector 68 and first medial connector 78 is only one example of a wide variety of potential connector structures. For example, two or more generally parallel flanges such as flange 72 may be provided on the bridge 46. Alternatively, a structure similar to flange 72 can be provided on the first orbital 42, to cooperate with complementary surface structures on bridge 46 such as an aperture or one or more complementary flanges such as 72.<br>
Interlocking hinge-type structures, snap-fit structures, screws, thermal bonding, adhesives, and any of a variety of other techniques can be utilized to secure the components together. However, the preferred embodiment of the invention utilizes complementary surfaces structures which can be connected such as by a pin to produce at least some range of pivotal motion between the bridge 46 and the orbital 42. Alt of the connections in the articulated eyeglass frame can be made such that they can be disconnected by the user, such as to permit the user to customize the product with interchangeable component parts<br>
Bridge 46 is provided with a similar second bridge connector 70, for pivotably connecting to a complementary surface structure in the form of second medial connector 80 on the medial section 56 of second orbital 44 Preferably, the complementary surface structures utilized to construct the connector between the bridge 46 and first orbital 42 will be similar to that utilized to connect the bridge 46 to the second orbital 44.<br>
The lateral section 54 of first orbital 42 is provided with a first lateral connector 84. First lateral connector 84 cooperates with a front segment connector 86 on link 60. tn the illustrated embodiment, the front<br><br>
-9-<br>
segment connector 86 comprises a flange 88 having a transverse aperture 90 extending therethrough. The first lateral connector 84 on first orbital 42 comprises an aperture 91 adapted to be coaxiaily aligned with the aperture 90 when the first link 60 is mounted to the first orbital 42. As has been discussed, a pin or other structure (not illustrated) is thereafter positioned through apertures 90 and 91, to connect the first link 60 to the first orbital 42.<br>
The first link 60 is further provided with a rear connector 92 such as an aperture 93 which may intersect a recess (not illustrated) as will be understood by those of skill in the art. The first earstem 64 is provided with an earstem connector 94 which, in the illustrated embodiment, comprises an aperture 95 adapted to be coaxially aligned with the aperture 93 in the installed position. A pin may then be utilized to hold the components together.<br>
The corresponding connections between the second orbital 44, second link 62 and second earstem 66 are preferably mirror images of the description above, and will not be further detailed herein.<br>
Preferably, the first eyeglass orbital 42 and second orbital 44 are constructed from a substantially dimension ally stable material In the preferred embodiment, the first orbital 42 and second orbital 44 comprise a metal, such as titanium or a titanium-containing alloy. The titanium or titanium alloy orbitals 42 and 44 are preferably formed through an investment casting, operation as has been discussed herein.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention each of the bridge 46, first orbital 42, second orbital 44, first link 60, second link 62, and first earstem 64 and second earstem 66 are all investment cast from a titanium or titanium alloy. However any one or more of the foregoing components can optionally be constructed from more conventional materials such as metal wire or plastic.<br>
One advantage of investment cast titanium components is the ability to minimize torsional distortion through the eyeglass system. The eyeglass system of the present invention maintains a substantially constant orientation in the horizontal plane, throughout its various ranges of motion. This feature is facilitated by the relative rigidity of the metal components, and also through the use of the generally planar flange-type connectors, or other connectors which permit pivoting, where desired, but minimize rotation of one component with respect to the other in the horizontal plane<br>
In a titanium embodiment, or other metal embodiment, whether or not investment cast, the components are generally more rigid than prior art polymeric eyeglass frame components. Some degree of flexibility is generally required in an eyeglass frame, to accommodate different heat widths and also to provide retention on the head of the wearer with an optimum comfort level. For this purpose, some or all of the various connectors in the eyeglass system preferably provide some range of motion between adjacent components. For example, each of the first and second orbitals 42 is preferably pivotable through a range of within about ± 15° with respect to the bridge 46 Preferably, the eyeglass orbitals 42 and 44 are ptvotable through a range of no more than about ± 10°. More preferably, each of the eyeglass orbitals 42 and 44 are pivotable through a range of no more than about 5° with respect to the bridge 46.<br><br>
-10-<br>
The range of motion can be limited in any of a variety of ways, such as by the contour on an abutment surface 47 adapted to contact an opposing abutment surface 49 when the first bridge connector 68 is connected to the first medial connector 78. By adjusting the spacing between the first abutment 47 and second abutment 49, alone or as well as the contour of the complementary surfaces, the range of pivotal motion between bridge 46 and orbital 42 can be controlled. Similar structural configurations can be utilized throughout each of the various connections in the eyeglass system<br>
Within a particular range of motion for a particular connection, it may be desirable to dampen the pivotable motion, or to resiliently bias the joint to a particular orientation or in a particular direction. This may be accomplished, for example, by placing a spring or resilient pad in-between the opposing surfaces 47 and 49, or each of the other similarly opposing joint surfaces throughout the eyeglass frame. The resilient pad may extend throughout only a portion or all of the complementary abutment surfaces 47 or 49. In one embodiment, the resilient pad is in the form of an 0 ring which is positioned around the flange 72 such that it lies in the plane which extends through the space between surfaces 47 and 49 in the assembled configuration.<br>
By adjusting the durometer and/or thickness of the damper pad, together with the relative compression in the mounted configuration, any of a wide variety of biasing forces and ranges of motion can be achieved.<br>
The earstem is preferably fold able to a collapsed configuration such as for storage of the eyeglasses 40 as is known in the art In general, the primary folding of the earstem can be accomplished at the earstem connector 94 or at the first lateral connector 84 on orbital 42 In one embodiment of the invention, folding of the earstem can be accomplished through pivoting at both the first lateral connector 84 and earstem connector 94. Preferably, however, the first lateral connector 84 provides only a relatively limited range, of motion, and the primary folding of the earstem 64 is accomplished at the earstem connector 94 Thus, earstem connector 94 preferably permits the earstem 64 to be pivotably rotated with respect to first link 60 throughout a range of at least about 90°. The pivotable connection between the first orbital 42 and first link 62 is preferably limited to no more than about ± 5° More preferably, the range of motion between the first orbital 42 and first link 60 is limited to no more than about ± 2.5°.<br>
A separate nosepiece can additionally be added to the eyeglass 40. Alternatively, the lower surface of the bridge 46 can be configured to cooperate with the medial edges of first orbital 42 and second orbital 44 to rest on the nose of the wearer without the need for additional nosepiece components.<br>
Each of the first and second orbitals 42 and 44 are illustrated as completely surrounding the respective first and second lenses 48 and 50 Alternatively, the first and second orbitals 42 and 44 can be configured to surround only a portion of the first and second lenses 48 and 50 without departing from the spirit of the present invention. The lens 48 may be retained within the orbital 42 in any of a variety of manners that may be appropriate for the construction material of the lens 48 and orbital 42. For example, in an embodiment having a polycarbonate lens and an investment cast titanium orbital, the lens is preferably advanced into an annular seat in the orbital m a manner similar to that described in connection with Figures 2 and 4. One or more retention structures, such as an annular snap fit ring may then be press-fit into the orbital to retain the lens in position. .See Figure 2.<br><br>
-11-<br>
Alternativety, the lens may be sandwiched between a front and a rear component of the eyeglass orbital, which are configured to combine to produce the finished orbital. Gaskets or other padding structures may also be incorporated to provide a spacer between the material of the lens 48 and the material of the orbital 42. Lens retention structures may be held in place by friction fit, screws, welds, adhesives or any of a variety of ways depending upon desired assembly and durability characteristics.<br>
