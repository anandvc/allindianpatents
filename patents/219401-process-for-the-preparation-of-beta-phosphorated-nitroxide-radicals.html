P^-PMOSPHORATBD   NITROX-IPB   RADICALC<br>
A subject-matter of the present invention is a process for the preparation of (3-phosphorated nitroxide radicals of formula:<br>
in which R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 will be defined subsequently. These compounds are used in particular as regulators of radical polymerization.<br>
These compounds can be obtained in particular by the oxidation of N-alkylaminophosphonates of formula:<br>
The  N-alkylaminophosphonates   (II)   can  be obtained in a known way by reacting a carbonyl compound RLR"C(O),  a  primary  amine  R3NH2  and  a  phosphorus compound HP(O)R4R5 having a mobile hydrogen according to a Mannich-type reaction:<br><br>
A process is disclosed in international patent application WO 96/24620 which consists in reacting, in a first stage, a carbonyl compound R1R2C(O) with a primary amine RJNH;. according to a carbonyl compound/primary amine molar ratio substantially equal to I arid then, in a second stage, in adding, to the compound obtained in the first stage, a phosphorus<br>
compound HP(O)R4R' according to a phosphorus compound/ product: obtained in the first stage molar ratio ranging from 1.5 to 2.5, indeed even more. There are several disadvantages to this way of proceeding.<br>
Thus, the water formed in the first stage during the reaction of the carbonyl compound with the primary amirie which results in the formation of an imine according to the scheme:<br>
&gt; C = 0 + -1SIH2 -&gt; &gt; C = N- + H20<br>
is not removed before the addition of the phosphorus compound, which may be of such a nature as to result in a possible? hydrolysis of the said phosphorus compound, in particular when the latter is a phosphite.<br>
In addition, the use of a very large excess of phosphorus compound (150% to 250%, indeed even more) with respect to the compound obtained in the first stage (iruine) is prohibitory for an industrial process.<br>
Furthermore, this excess, in addition to the fact of the difficulties in removing it, is of such a nature as to generate numerous impurities by reaction with, in particular^, the unconverted carbonyl compound to result in hydroxyphosphonates (&gt;C(OH)-P(O)
All these impurities liable to be present in the crude product (II) make the purification of the N-alkylamiriophosphonate (II) difficult and consequently render its subsequent use difficult.<br>
In order to overcome these disadvantages,  the<br>
Applicant Company has synthesized the aminophosphonate<br>
(II) by reaction of a carbonyl compound R1R2C(0) , of a<br>
primary  ainine  R-'NH:&gt;  and  of  a  phosphorous  compound<br>
HP (O) E'1K'.' . the following stages being carried out:<br>
a)   a carbonyl compound R1R'C(O) is reacted with a •primary   amine   R3NH2   according   to   an<br>
R]R':C (O) /R3NH^ molar ratio of between 0.8 and 1.5 and preferably between 0.9 and 1.1 at a temperature of between 0°C and 120°C and a pressure ranging from 1 to 10 bar; then the water formed is removed from the reaction medium;<br>
b)	the compound obtained in a) is reacted with a<br>
phosphorus compound HP(O)R4R5 used according<br>
to an HP (O) R4Rb/compound a)  molar ratio at<br>
most equal to 1.5 and preferably of between 1<br>
and 1.5 at a temperature of between 0°C and<br>
120°C;<br>
c)	an acidic treatment of the reaction medium<br>
obtained in b)  is carried out,  an organic<br>
solvent is subsequently added,  separation by<br>
settling is carried out, the aqueous phase is<br>
recovered arid then a basic treatment of the<br>
said aqueous phase is carried out;<br>
d)	the aminophosphonate is extracted by means of<br>
an organic  solvent identical  to that used<br>
previously in c) ;<br>
e)	the said solvent is then completely removed<br>
and  the  said  aminophosphonate   (II)   is<br>
isolated and  is  oxidized to p-phosphorated<br>
nitroxide according to the stages a1), b1) and<br>
c1) described below.<br>
Although it is possible, by operating in this way, to overcome some disadvantages of the prior art, it is nevertheless a fact that the reaction between the phosphite and the imine - stage b) - is lengthy (several hours) and that the aminophosphonate II, although devoid of heavy impurities, is obtained at the price of a tedious acid/base purification and extraction treatment in a solvent medium which is burdensome to the overall process for obtaining the [j-phosphorated nitroxide (I), which nitroxide is obtained by oxidation of the said aminophosphonate (II) according to a process disclosed in Application<br>
FR 2 '788 270,  incorporated in the present document by reference.<br>
This process consists in oxidizing the amino-phosphonate (II) by carrying out the following stages:<br>
a") the aminophosphonate (II) obtained in e) 153 dissolved in a water-immiscible organic solvent, then;<br>
b1) subsequently, an amount of non-halogenated organic peracid, according to a peracid/aminophosphonate (II) molar ratio ranging from 1.5 to 2.5, and a sufficient amount of a basic aqueous solution of an alkali metal carbonate or hydrogencarbonate or of an alkaline earth metal carbonate or hydrogencarbonate or alternatively of an ammonia solution to produce a pH ranging from 5 to 12 and preferably ranging from 6 to 9 are simultaneously added with vigorous stirring, at a temperature of between -10°C and +40°C and preferably of between -5°C and +30°C, to the medium thus obtained, until the aminophosphonate (II) has been completely converted;<br>
c1) the organic phase is then recovered by simple separation by settling and the (3--phosphorated nitroxide is isolated by evaporation of the organic solvent under reduced pressure.<br>
This oxidation process makes it possible to obtain a (3-phosphorated nitroxide with a purity satisfactory for subsequent use thereof but the overall productive output of the process is lowered because the preparation of the aminophosphonate II is lengthy and requires, in order to 'have a purity which is sufficient to be oxidized, an expensive purification and isolation treat.meni: ..<br>
The Applicant Company has now found that, it can rapidly obtain an aminophosphonate while avoiding the stages o) and d) of the acid/base treatment in a solvent medium and the extraction stage e) , this being achieved while operating with a phosphite/imirie molar ratio substantially equal to 1 and while carrying out stage b) in the presence of a Lewis acid.<br>
A subject-matter of the present invention is thus a process for the manufacture of compounds of general formula:<br>

a)	a carbonyl compound R1R2C(O) is reacted with a<br>
primary   amine   R3NH2   according   to   an<br>
R1R"C(O)/R3NH2 molar ratio of between 0.8 and<br>
1.5 and preferably between 0.9 and 1 . I at a<br>
temperature of between 0°C and 120°C and a<br>
pressure ranging from 1 to 10 bar; then the<br>
water  formed  is  removed  from the  reaction<br>
medium; and<br>
b)	the compound obtained in a) is reacted with a<br>
phosphorus compound HP(O)R4Rb;<br>
the said process being characterized in that stage b) is carried out in the presence of a Lewis acid using an HP (0) R^R'Y compound obtained in stage a) molar ratio substantially equal to 1 at a temperature at most equal to 100°C and in that the medium obtained in b) is subjected directly and without purification to an oxidation reaction carried out according to the conditions mentioned above.<br>
The purity of the p-phosphorated nitroxide obtained can be improved by flash distillation under reduced pressure or by low temperature crystallization.<br>
According to the present invention, the Lewis acid is chosen from BF, and its complex.es with ethers, such as d.l ethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran; lanthanide<br>
tri }• 1 uorat es ,   such  as  ytterbium  trifluoromethane-sulphonai:e (CF,SO3) 3Yb; SriCl,,, SnCl2 or ZnCl2.<br>
Preferably,  boron  trifluoride  diethyl  ether (CHjOHJ . O-BF-, will be used.<br>

Use will preferably be made of tert-butylamine, isopropylamine, diphenylmethylamine, 1-phenylethylamine or cyclohexylamine.<br>
The reaction between the carbonyl compound R'R/JC(O) and the amine R!NH2 (stage a) is carried out with vigorous stirring at a temperature of between 0°C and 120°C and preferably at a temperature of between 0°C and 60°C. The reaction is generally carried out at a pressure of between 1 bar and 10 bar, preferably at atmospheric pressure, and under an inert gas atmosphere, such as nitrogen or argon. The reaction time can vary within wide limits. It depends on the reactivity of the amine employed. The complete conversion of the carbonyl compound R1R'2C(O) can be confirmed by chrornatographic (GC) analysis.<br>
On  completion  of  the  reaction,  stirring  is halted and the reaction medium is allowed to separate<br>
by settling. Separation by settling is generally rapid. The aqueous phase, consisting virtually entirely of the water formed during the reaction between the carbonyl compound and the primary amine which, results in the irnine (TI'I) , according to the scheme:<br>
R1R2C(0)<br>

is subsequently removed.<br>
The removal of the water can be completed by the addition of a dehydrating agent, such as a molecular sieve, to the phase which has been separated by settling or alternatively azeotropic distillation can be carried out.<br>

The phosphorous compound HP(O)R4Rb is added to the imine (III) obtained in stage a) with vigorous stirring at a temperature at most equal to 100 °C and preferably at a temperature of between 40°C and 80°C. As in stage a) , the reaction is carried out under an inert gas atmosphere and preferably at atmospheric pressure. On completion of the addition, the Lewis acid is slowly added.<br><br>
the addition of the Lewis acid is the temperature is allowed to rise to at arid preferably between 40°C and 80°C. On completion of the addition, the reaction medium is kept stirred at most 1 hour at a, temperature reached at the end of the addition of the Lewis acid.<br>
The phosphorous compound HP(0)R'iR5 is used, with respect to the imine obtained in stage a), according to a phosphorous compound/imine (III) molar ratio substantially equal to 1.<br>
The reaction medium obtained in stage b)  is subsequently  subjected  directly  to  an  oxidation reaction according to stages a1) to c1) described above. Mention will be made, by way of illustration of organic solvents which can be used according to the present invention in stages a1)  to c1),  of aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as pentane, heptane or cyclohexane/ chlorinated  solvents,   such  as  CH2C12;  esters  of aliphatic  acids,  such  as  ethyl  acetate  or  ethyl propionate,  or  a  mixture  of  at  least  two  of  the abovement:ioned solvents.<br>

The compounds (II) obtained according to the invention can be identified by proton, 13C and 31P NMR, by IR and by elemental analysis.<br>
The compounds obtained according to the process of the present invention have a sufficient purity to be used as regulators of radical polymerizations.<br>
The process according to the present invention is fast and exhibits the advantage of not using solvent during the synthesis of the aminophosphonate and not having to purify the said aminophosphonate, which reduces the amount of effluents to be treated. This results in reduced handling operations, allowing the productive output of the process to be increased.<br>
'The process according to the present invention also exhibits the advantage of resulting in high yields of |3 -phosphorated nitroxide radicals.<br>
