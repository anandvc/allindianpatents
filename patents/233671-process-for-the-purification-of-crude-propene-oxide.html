				<td>PROCESS FOR THE PURIFICATION OF CRUDE PROPENE OXIDE<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the<br>
purification of crude propeneloxide removing methanol and acetaldehyde<br>
impurities to levels below 100 ppm in a single distillation step and to<br>
a process for the preparation of propene oxide using such a purification<br>
stage.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
From EP-A 100 119 it is known that propene can be converted by hydrogen<br>
peroxide to propene oxide if a titanium silicalite is used as catalyst.<br>
Methanol is the preferred solvent leading to high catalyst activity.<br>
Crude propene oxide obtained by this process usually contains more than<br>
1 X by weight methanol and more than 200 ppm acetaldehyde from side<br>
reactions. Depending on the reaction conditions the crude propene oxide<br>
may also contain methyl formate in amounts exceeding 200 ppm.<br>
Most of the propene oxide is used as a starting material for polyether<br>
polyols which in turn are used to make polyurethane foams. Propene oxide<br>
for this application has to meet stringent purity requirements and the<br>
content of methanol, acetal dehyde and methyl formate has to be below 100<br>
ppm for each component. Therefore propene oxide produced with a titanium<br>
silicalite catalyst has to be further purified and impurities of<br>
methanol, acetaldehyde and, if present, methyl formate have to be<br>
removed.<br>
Methanol, acetaldehyde and methyl formate are difficult to remove from<br>
propene oxide by simple distillation. In mixtures containing more than<br>
98 mol-% propene oxide these compounds show virtually the same relative<br>
volatility than propene oxide. Therefore distillative purification down<br>
to low levels of methanol, acetaldehyde and methyl formate requires<br>
columns with large numbers of separation stages operated at high reflux<br>
ratios. This leads to uneconomical investment and energy costs.<br>
Numerous methods have been suggested to remove methanol, acetaldehyde<br>
and methyl formate from propene oxide. Extractive distillation is an<br>
established method to purify propene oxide and remove oxygenated<br>
impurities.<br>
EP-A 1 009 746 discloses the purification of propene oxide containing<br>
methanol and acetaldehyde by extractive distillation with a polar<br>
extraction solvent having a hydroxy functionality. The process also<br>
removes part of the acetaldehyde contained in the crude propene oxide.<br>
However, as can be seen from the examples, the purified propene oxide<br>
still contains acetaldehyde and methanol in amounts exceeding 100 ppm.<br>
Therefore further purification steps are necessary to achieve the<br>
desired propene oxide purity.<br>
EP-B 004 019 discloses an alternative to extractive distillation for the<br>
removal of carbonyl compounds from propene oxide by subjecting the crude<br>
propene oxide to a simple distillation and feeding a compound containing<br>
an unsubstituted NH2 group to the distillation column at a point above<br>
the feed point of the crude propene oxide. Liquid compounds with an NH2<br>
group, such as hydrazine and hydrazine hydrate are fed as such. Solid<br>
compounds with an NH2 group are fed dissolved in an inert solvent. The<br>
document also describes that a solvent contained in the crude propene<br>
oxide can be separated from propene oxide in the same distillation step.<br>
However, the document contains no information or indication that<br>
methanol can be separated from propene oxide by the disclosed process.<br>
All the solvents disclosed in EP-B 004 019 in column 7 lines 8 to 12 are<br>
of the type that can be easily separated by simple distillation from<br>
propene oxide because of sufficient differences in volatility. From the<br>
fact, that there is only a very small difference between the volatility<br>
of methanol and propene oxide at high propene oxide concentrations, a<br>
skilled person can conclude, that the process disclosed in EP-B 004 019<br>
comprising a simple distillation is not capable to remove methanol down<br>
to the desired level of less than 100 ppm when operated at economically<br>
viable values for the number of separation stages and reflux ratio.<br>
EP-B 004 019 also teaches that aqueous solutions of hydrazine have<br>
certain disadvantages when used for the removal of acetaldehyde:<br>
reaction of aldehyde is slow and reaction with acetaldehyde leads to<br>
insoluble products. In the propene oxide purification process disclosed<br>
in EP-B 004 019 slow reaction of aldehydes will lead to incomplete<br>
removal of acetaldehyde and the formation of insoluble products will<br>
lead to undesired deposits in the distillation column and the bottoms<br>
reboiler.<br>
US-2,622,060 discloses a process for the purification of a crude propene<br>
oxide by extractive distillation using an aqueous solution of an<br>
alkaline compound, such as sodium hydroxide, as the extraction solvent.<br>
Although efficient for the removal of methyl formate by saponification<br>
the process has serious drawbacks. When operated as a batch distillation<br>
it leads to excessive loss of propene oxide by propene oxide<br>
saponification. When operated as a continuous distillation purification<br>
is inefficient with the purified propene oxide containing more than<br>
1000 ppm acetaldehyde and methanol each and having a purity of not more<br>
than 97 %. Therefore further distillation steps are necessary to purify<br>
the propene oxide.<br>
The known methods for the purification of a crude propene oxide all have<br>
a disadvantage in that they need more than one distillation step to<br>
purify a crude propene oxide containing more than 1 % by weight methanol<br>
and more than 200 ppm acetaldehyde to the desired purity of less than<br>
100 ppm methanol and acetal dehyde each.<br>
Therefore it is an object of the present invention to provide a process<br>
for the purification of a crude propene oxide containing more than<br>
1 it by weight methanol and more than 200 ppm acetaldehyde to give a<br>
purified propene oxide containing less than 100 ppm methanol and less<br>
than 100 ppm acetaldehyde using only one distillation step.<br>
Subject-matter of the Invention<br>
This object has been attained by a process for the purification of a<br>
crude propene oxide containing methanol and acetaldehyde by a<br>
continuously operated extractive distillation, wherein<br>
(i) an extraction solvent is fed to the distillation column at a point<br>
above the feeding point of the crude propene oxide in an amount<br>
effective for Towering the volatility of methanol relative to the<br>
volatility of propene oxide,<br>
(ii) a compound containing an unsubstituted NH2 group and capable of<br>
reacting with acetaldehyde at the conditions of distillation to<br>
form compounds with a boiling point higher than that of propene<br>
oxide is fed to the distillation column at a point above the<br>
feeding point of the crude propene oxide or is admixed with the<br>
crude propene oxide feed to the distillation column and<br>
(iii) a purified propene oxide is withdrawn from the distillation column<br>
at a position above the feeding points of the extraction solvent<br>
and the compound containing an unsubstituted NH2 group.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the present invention refers to a process as<br>
defined above wherein the crude propene oxide is mixed with an aqueous<br>
alkaline solution and the mixture is reacted for 1 to 200 min at a<br>
temperature from 20 to 100°C before feeding it to the extractive<br>
distillation.<br>
The object has furthermore been attained by a process for the catalytic<br>
epoxidation of propene in which<br>
a)    in a reaction step the propene is reacted with aqueous hydrogen<br>
peroxide in methanol in the presence of a titanium silicalite<br>
catalyst,<br>
b)    the product stream from the reaction step is optionally passed to<br>
a pressure release step, and<br>
c)    the product stream is then separated in a pre-evaporator having<br>
less than 20 theoretical separation stages into an overhead<br>
product containing propene, propene oxide and methanol, and into a<br>
bottom product containing methanol and water, 20 to 60% of the<br>
total amount of methanol introduced with the product stream being<br>
removed with the overhead product and the residue remaining in the<br>
bottom product,<br>
d)    the overhead product from step c) is at least partially condensed<br>
and optionally propene and any propane present are stripped to<br>
give a condensate containing propene oxide, more than 1 % by<br>
weight methanol and more than 200 wppm acetaldehyde,<br>
e)    the condensate from step d) is subjected to an extractive<br>
distillation step as defined above, whereby a bottom product<br>
containing methanol and the extraction solvent is obtained, and<br>
f)    all or a part of the bottom product from step c) optionally after<br>
partially removing water is recycled to the reaction step a).<br>
Detailed description of the Invention<br>
The purification process according to the invention is particularly<br>
suitable for the purification of crude propene oxide containing more<br>
than 1 X by weight methanol and more than 200 wppm acetaldehyde (wppm =<br>
weight parts per million). The crude propene oxide is preferably<br>
obtained by epoxidation of propene with hydrogen peroxide using a<br>
titanium containing silicalite catalyst and a methanol solvent. The<br>
purified propene oxide usually contains less than 100 wpprn methanol and<br>
less than 100 wpprn acetaldehyde, preferably less than 50 wpprn methanol<br>
and less than 50 wpprn acetaldehyde.<br>
In the purification process the crude propene oxide is subjected to a<br>
continuously operated extractive distillation. In the extractive<br>
distillation an extraction solvent is fed to the distillation column at<br>
a point above the feeding point of the crude propene oxide. Suitable as<br>
extraction solvent are compounds or compound mixtures which lower the<br>
volatility of methanol relative to the volatility of propene oxide in<br>
mixtures comprising propene oxide, methanol and the extraction solvent.<br>
The extraction solvent preferably has a boiling point of more than 50°C<br>
to obtain a purified propene oxide with a low content of the extraction<br>
solvent. Preferably the extraction solvent comprises a polar compound<br>
containing a hydroxy group functionality.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention the extraction solvent<br>
comprises one or a mixture of several components that occur in the<br>
manufacturing process for the crude propene oxide, either as components<br>
of the feed streams or as byproducts formed in the process. Preferably<br>
the extraction solvent is water, propylene glycol, l-methoxy-2-propanol,<br>
2-methoxy-l-propanol, or a mixture of two or more of these compounds.<br>
Water is particularly preferred as the extraction solvent. This<br>
embodiment of the invention has the advantage that the bottom product of<br>
the extractive distillation can be combined with one or more of the<br>
process streams obtained in the process for manufacturing the crude<br>
propene oxide for the recovery of methanol and optionally the recovery<br>
of the extraction solvent. Therefore no extra distillation column is<br>
required for the recovery of methanol and optionally the extraction<br>
solvent from the bottom product of the extractive distillation.<br>
In the purification process of the invention an additional compound<br>
containing an unsubstituted NH2 group is either fed to the distillation<br>
column at a point above the feeding point of the crude propene oxide or<br>
is admixed with the crude propene oxide feed to the distillation column.<br>
Suitable are all compounds containing an unsubstituted NH2 group which<br>
are capable of reacting with acetaldehyde at the conditions of<br>
distillation to form compounds with a boiling point higher than that of<br>
propene oxide. Suitable for the inventive process are also the salts of<br>
these compounds formed with acids wherein the NH2 group is protonated to<br>
an NH3+ group. Preferred are compounds wherein the unsubstituted NH2<br>
group is directly bonded to a nitrogen or oxygen atom. Examples for<br>
these preferred compounds are hydrazine, hydrazine monohydrate,<br>
methyl hydrazine, N.N-dimethyl hydrazine and hydroxylamine as well as<br>
salts thereof, such as hydrazine sulfate, hydrazine hydrochloride or<br>
hydroxylamine sulfate. Hydrazine is particularly preferred.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention a mixture of the extraction<br>
solvent and a compound containing an unsubstituted NH2 group is fed to<br>
the distillation column. Preferably this mixture is an aqueous hydrazine<br>
solution. Particularly preferred are aqueous hydrazine solutions<br>
containing from 0.5 to 5 X by weight hydrazine. Contrary to the<br>
teachings of EP-B 904 019 aqueous hydrazine solutions have been found to<br>
be surprisingly efficient. Reaction with acetaldehyde in the<br>
distillation column is fast, leading to almost complete acetaldehyde<br>
conversion and no deposits of insoluble compounds are formed in the<br>
distillation column or the distillation bottom reboiler.<br>
The amount of the extraction solvent fed to the distillation column is<br>
preferably chosen so that the mass ratio of the extraction solvent feed<br>
relative to the amount of methanol contained in the crude propene oxide<br>
feed is in the range from 0.1 to 10. The amount of the compound<br>
containing an unsubstituted NH2 group fed to the distillation column is<br>
preferably chosen so that the molar ratio of the compound containing an<br>
unsubstituted NH2 group relative to the acetaldehyde contained in the<br>
crude propene oxide feed is in the range from 0.5 to 2. If a mixture of<br>
the extraction solvent and the compound containing an unsubstituted NH2<br>
group is fed to the distillation column the composition of the mixture<br>
and the amounts fed are preferably chosen so that both the preferred<br>
mass ratio of the extraction solvent to methanol as well as the<br>
preferred molar ratio of the compound containing an unsubstituted NH2<br>
group relative to acetaldehyde are met.<br>
In the purification process of the invention the purified propene oxide<br>
is withdrawn from the distillation column at a position above the<br>
feeding points of the extraction solvent and the compound containing an<br>
unsubstituted NH2 group. Preferably the purified propene oxide is<br>
withdrawn at the top of the column. In this case the reflux ratio of<br>
condensate returned to the column relative to condensate withdrawn as<br>
purified propene oxide is preferably chosen in the range from 1 to 5.<br>
The extractive distillation is preferably operated at an absolute<br>
pressure from 1 to 5 bar, more preferably at an absolute pressure from<br>
1.5 to 2.5 bar.<br>
The distillation column used for the extractive distillation comprises a<br>
stripping section between the column bottoms and the feed point of the<br>
crude propene oxide, an extraction section between the feed point of the<br>
crude propene oxide and the feed point of the extraction solvent and a<br>
rectifying section between the feed point of the extraction solvent and<br>
the point where the purified propene oxide is withdrawn. Preferably a<br>
distillation column is used that has a separation efficiency of 10 to 30<br>
theoretical stages in both the stripping section and the extraction<br>
section and a separation efficiency of 20 to 60 theoretical stages in<br>
the rectifying section. The distillation column can be a tray column<br>
containing discrete trays such as sieve trays or bubble cap trays. The<br>
distillation column can also be a packed column and both random packings<br>
as well as structured packings, such as metal gauze packings can be<br>
used. The distillation column may also combine sections with discrete<br>
trays and sections with packings. The extraction section is preferably<br>
designed with discrete trays.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention the crude propene oxide is<br>
mixed with an aqueous alkaline solution and reacted before feeding it to<br>
the extractive distillation. The reaction time between mixing the crude<br>
propene oxide with the aqueous alkaline solution and feeding the mixture<br>
to the extractive distillation is typically in the range from 1 to<br>
200 minutes, preferably from 1 to 30 minutes. Reaction temperature is<br>
typically from 20 to 100°C. The aqueous alkaline solution is preferably<br>
an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, or sodium<br>
carbonate. Most preferred are aqueous sodium hydroxide solutions<br>
containing from 0.1 to 2 X by weight sodium hydroxide. The amount of the<br>
aqueous alkaline solution is preferably chosen so that the molar ratio<br>
of hydroxide ions introduced with the aqueous alkaline solution relative<br>
to the amount of methyl formate contained in the crude propene oxide is<br>
in the range from 1.1 to 4. The mixture of crude propene oxide with the<br>
aqueous alkaline solution is preferably reacted in a tubular reactor<br>
before feeding it to the distillation. Reacting the crude propene oxide<br>
with an aqueous alkaline solution converts methyl formate contained in<br>
the crude propene oxide by hydrolyzing it to methanol and formate. The<br>
purified propene oxide obtained with this embodiment of the invention<br>
has a reduced content of methyl formate. Preferably the amount of<br>
aqueous alkaline solution is chosen to obtain a purified propene oxide<br>
having a content of methanol of less than 50 wppm, a content of<br>
acetaldehyde of less than 50 wppm and a content of methyl formate of<br>
less than 100 wppm.<br>
The invention is also directed towards an improved process for the<br>
catalytic epoxidation of propene with aqueous hydrogen peroxide and a<br>
titanium silicalite catalyst. The improved process integrates the<br>
extractive distillation of the invention into the workup of the reaction<br>
mixture to provide propene oxide of high purity with a minimum of<br>
separation steps and a low energy requirement.<br>
The epoxidation of propene with hydrogen peroxide is carried out in the<br>
presence of a titanium silicalite catalyst and a methanol solvent.<br>
Crystalline titanium silicalites, preferably of the composition<br>
(Ti02)x(Si02)1-x where x is from 0.001 to 0.05 and having a MFI or MEL<br>
crystalline structure, known as titanium silicalite-1 and titanium<br>
silicalite-2, are suitable as catalysts for the epoxidation process<br>
according to the invention. Such catalysts may be produced for example<br>
according to the process described in US-A 4,410,501.<br>
The methanol solvent used in the epoxidation may contain 0 to 20 X by<br>
weight of water due to recycling of substances in the process.<br>
Hydrogen peroxide is preferably used as an aqueous solution containing<br>
10 to 90 X by weight of hydrogen peroxide. A hydrogen peroxide crude<br>
product obtained from the extraction step of the anthraquinone process<br>
and containing 30 to 45 X by weight of hydrogen peroxide is preferably<br>
used. Alternatively, hydrogen peroxide solutions in alcohols, preferably<br>
in methanol caln be used. These alcoholic solutions can be prepared by<br>
reaction of hydrogen and oxygen in presence of a noble metal catalyst<br>
and the alcohol.<br>
Propene may be used mixed with propane in an amount of between 0 and<br>
50 vol.% of propane. Preferably, the propene contains between 5 and<br>
20 vol.% of propane.<br>
 In one embodiment of the invention the titanium silicalite catalyst is<br>
suspended in the reaction mixture during the reaction. The catalyst is<br>
then used in the form of a powder or in the form of a suspendable<br>
granular material that has been produced by forming in a manner known<br>
per se, for example by spray drying or fluidised bed granulation. When<br>
 using a suspended catalyst, flow mixing reactors, for example stirred<br>
tank reactors or recycle reactors, as well as non-flow mixing reactors,<br>
for example tubular flow reactors, may be used for the reaction.<br>
A cascade consisting of one to three flow mixing reactors and a non-flow<br>
mixing reactor connected downstream is preferably used.<br><br>
In another embodiment of the invention the titanium silicalite catalyst<br>
is used as a fixed bed over which a mixture of the feedstock materials<br>
is passed. The catalyst is then used in the form of shaped bodies that<br>
have been produced in a manner known per se, for example by extrusion<br>
 with the addition of binders. For the forming process the catalyst may<br>
contain 1 to 99* of a binder or carrier material, all binders and<br>
carrier materials being suitable that do not react with hydrogen<br>
peroxide or with the epoxide under the reaction conditions employed for<br>
the epoxidation. Extrudates with a diameter of 1 to 5 mm are preferably<br>
 used as fixed bed catalysts.<br>
When using a fixed bed catalyst, reactors with bubble column<br>
characteristics can be used, i.e. the reactor contains a continuous<br>
liquid phase and a dispersed gaseous phase flows through the reactor in<br>
  up-flow mode. Alternatively, reactors with trickle bed characteristics<br>
can be used, i.e. the reactor contains a gas phase and a liquid phase<br>
flows through the reactor in down-flow mode.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention the<br>
process is conducted in a fixed bed reactor and the following flow<br>
conditions are selected to maintain the catalyst bed in a trickle bed<br>
state:<br>
Q/k 
L\|/ 
wherei n<br>
G is the gaseous superficial velocity defined as the gaseous flow rate<br>
in m3/h in the continuous flow reactor divided by the cross-section of<br>
the catalyst bed in m2,<br>
L is the liquid superficial velocity defined as the liquid flow rate in<br>
m3/h in the continuous flow reactor divided by the cross-section of the<br>
catalyst bed in m2,<br>
The epoxidation reaction is preferably carried out at temperatures<br>
between 0 and 80°C, more preferably between 40 and 65°C. According to a<br>
most preferred embodiment of the present invention the epoxidation<br>
reaction is carried out in a fixed bed reactor equipped with cooling<br>
means and the temperature profile within the reactor is maintained such<br>
that the cooling medium temperature of the cooling means is at least<br>
30°C and the maximum temperature within the catalyst bed is 60°C at the<br>
most, preferably 55°C.<br>
The epoxidation reaction is preferably carried out at elevated pressures<br>
of 10 to 40 bar, more preferably 15 to 30 bar. Propene is used in excess<br>
and the residence time in the reactor is chosen so that a hydrogen<br>
peroxide conversion of more than 90#, preferably more than 95#, is<br>
achieved. The amount of solvent used is preferably chosen so as to<br>
achieve a ratio of 1 to 10 parts by weight of solvent to one part by<br>
weight of aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention the conditions for the<br>
epoxidation reaction, that is temperature, pressure and the amounts of<br>
propene, hydrogen peroxide and solvent, are chosen to obtain a<br>
multiphase reaction mixture comprising a liquid aqueous hydrogen<br>
peroxide rich phase containing methanol and a liquid organic olefin rich<br>
phase. To ensure the formation of a second liquid organic olefin rich<br>
phase the amount of propene has to be selected in excess of the amount<br>
soluble in the aqueous phase comprising water, hydrogen peroxide and<br>
methanol at the chosen temperature and pressure. Maintaining two<br>
immiscible liquid phases during the epoxidation reaction leads to<br>
improved propene oxide selectivity.<br>
Before the working up stage the pressure of the epoxidation reaction<br>
mixture is preferably released in a pressure release stage to the<br>
pressure employed in the working up of the propene oxide. Part of the<br>
propene dissolved in the reaction mixture and possibly propane is gassed<br>
out. The resultant gas is recompressed via a compressor to the pressure<br>
prevailing in the reactor and is returned to the reaction.<br>
The reaction mixture is then separated in a pre-evaporator into an<br>
overhead product containing propene, possibly propane, propene oxide and<br>
methanol, and into a bottom product containing methanol, water, higher<br>
boi1i ng poi nt byproducts, such as for exampl e propylene glycol,<br>
unreacted hydrogen peroxide and possibly suspended titanium silicalite<br>
catalyst. The pre-evaporator according to the invention has less than<br>
20, preferably at most 10 theoretical separation steps and is preferably<br>
designed so that the rectification section corresponds to a single<br>
distillation stage and the remaining separation effect is achieved in<br>
the stripping section. The pre-evaporator.is operated at a reflux ratio<br>
of at most 1.5 and if desired may also be operated totally without<br>
reflux. The pressure in the pre-evaporator is preferably chosen in the<br>
range from 1.5 to less than 3 bar in order to avoid decomposition of<br>
hydrogen peroxide . The pre-evaporator is operated so that between 20<br>
and 60* of the amount of solvent fed in with the reaction mixture is<br>
removed with the overhead product and the balance remains in the bottom<br>
product. Preferably, more than 95*, more preferably, more than 98* and<br>
most preferably, more than 99* of the propene oxide fed in is contained<br>
in the overhead product, and preferably, more than 90*. more preferably,<br>
more than 97* of the water fed in is contained in the bottom product.<br>
The product stream fed to the pre-evaporator preferably contains 0.5 to<br>
20 * by weight of propene, 0 to 4 * by weight of propane, 5 to 35 * by<br>
weight of propene oxide, 35 to 80 * by weight of methanol, 5 to 40 * by<br>
weight of water, 0.1 to 8 * by weight of higher boiling point<br>
byproducts, 0.1 to 5 * by weight hydrogen peroxide, 0 to 5 * by weight<br>
of titanium silicalite catalyst and more than 200 wppm acetaldehyde.<br>
This product stream is preferably separated in the pre-evaporator into<br>
an overhead product containing 1 to 40 * by weight of propene, 0 to 10 *<br>
by weight of propane, 15 to 75 * by weight of propene oxide, 20 to 85 *<br>
by weight of methanol, 0 to 5 * by weight of water and more than<br>
200 wppm acetaldehyde, and into a bottom product containing 0 to 2 X by<br>
weight of propene oxide, 30 to 80 X by weight of methanol, 15 to 65 X by<br>
weight of water, 0.1 to 10 X by weight of higher boiling point<br>
byproducts, 0.1 to 5 X by weight of hydrogen peroxide and 0 to 10 X by<br>
weight of titanium silicalite catalyst.<br>
The overhead product from the pre-evaporator is at least partially<br>
condensed to give a condensate containing propene oxide, more than 1 X<br>
by weight methanol and more than 200 wppm acetaldehyde. Preferably the<br>
overhead product is only partially condensed and the uncondensed<br>
propene, possibly mixed with propane, is recompressed via a compressor<br>
to the pressure prevailing in the reaction part and is recycled to the<br>
reaction. The propene still dissolved in the condensate and possibly<br>
propane are preferably stripped out from the condensate in a<br>
C3 stripper. Preferably the stripped-out gas is recycled to the partial<br>
condenser.<br>
In a most preferred embodiment the overhead product from the pre-<br>
evaporator is partially condensed in a first condenser and the gaseous<br>
effluent from the first condenser is condensed in a second condenser<br>
maintained at a temperature below the temperature of the first<br>
condenser. Preferably the temperature within the first condenser is<br>
maintained at 40 to 70°C and the temperature within the second condenser<br>
is maintained at 20 to 35°C. By using a two step condensation the amount<br>
of valuable propene oxide that can not be recovered is considerably<br>
reduced and the energy consumption for cooling is reduced compared to a<br>
one step condensation. When applying the two step condensation the<br>
condensates of both condensers are passed to the C3 stripper to remove<br>
constituents having a boiling point that is lower than that of propene<br>
oxide, whereby the gaseous effluent from the stripper is partially<br>
condensed in the second condenser and the condensate is recycled to the<br>
C3 stripper.<br>
The condensate, obtained by at least partially condensing the overhead<br>
product from the pre-evaporator and optionally stripping it in a<br>
C3 stripper is then subjected to an extractive distillation according to<br>
the invention as described above to give a purified propene oxide<br>
containing less than 100 wppm methanol and less than 100 wppm<br>
acetaldehyde. At the bottom of the extractive distillation column a<br>
bottom product containing methanol and the extraction solvent is<br>
obtained.<br>
The extraction solvent is preferably selected from water, propylene<br>
glycol, l-methoxy-2-propanol, 2-methoxy-l-propanol, or a mixture thereof<br>
Water is particularly preferred as the extraction solvent. The compound<br>
containing an unsubstituted NH2 group is preferably selected from<br>
hydrazine, hydrazine monohydrate, methyl hydrazine, N,N-dimethyl hydrazine<br>
and hydroxylamine as well as salts thereof, such as hydrazine sulfate,<br>
hydrazine hydrochloride or hydroxylamine sulfate. Hydrazine is<br>
particularly preferred.<br>
In a most preferred embodiment the condensate is stripped in a<br>
C3 stripper and the bottom product from the C3 stripper containing 15 to<br>
75 X by weight propene oxide, 25 to 85 X by weight methanol, 0 to 8 X by<br>
weight water, more than 200 wppm acetaldehyde and essentially no propene<br>
or propane is subjected to an extractive distillation according to the<br>
invention using an aqueous hydrazine solution containing from 0.5 to 5 X<br>
by weight hydrazine as the extraction solvent. The purified propene<br>
oxide containing less than 100 wppm methanol and less than 100 wppm<br>
acetaldehyde is withdrawn at the top of the extractive distillation<br>
column.<br>
At least a part and preferably all of the bottom product of the pre-<br>
evaporator comprising methanol and water is recycled to the epoxidation<br>
reaction. Preferably at least a part of the water contained in the<br>
bottom product of the pre-evaporator is removed before the recycle<br>
stream is fed to the epoxidation stage.<br>
Preferably the bottom product of the pre-evaporator is separated by<br>
distillation into a head product comprising methanol and a bottom<br>
product comprising water, high-boiling byproducts and non-reacted<br>
hydrogen peroxide. At least a part, preferably all of the head product<br>
obtained in this distillation step is recycled back to the reaction step<br>
of propene oxidation. This distillation step is preferably conducted<br>
under pressure and the pressure is selected so that the temperature of<br>
the head product comprising methanol is higher than the bottom<br>
temperature in the pre-evaporator and the C3 stripper, respectively. In<br>
this embodiment of the invention the condensation heat of the head<br>
product in said distillation step can be used to heat the pre-evaporator<br>
and the stripper and the energy requirement of the workup procedure is<br>
considerably reduced.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the epoxidation process the bottom product<br>
from the pre-evaporator is combined with the bottom product from the<br>
extractive distillation and the combined streams are subjected to a<br>
catalytic hydrogenation step. At least a part and preferably all of the<br>
resulting product is recycled to the epoxidation stage. Preferably at<br>
least a part of the water contained in the hydrogenated product is<br>
removed before the recycle stream is fed to the epoxidation stage.<br>
In a most preferred embodiment an aqueous hydrazine solution containing<br>
from 0.5 to 5 X by weight hydrazine is used as the extraction solvent,<br>
the bottom product from the pre-evaporator is combined with the bottom<br>
product from the extractive distillation and the combined streams are<br>
subjected to a catalytic hydrogenation step. The hydrogenated stream is<br>
then subjected to distillation into a bottom product comprising water<br>
and high-boiling byproducts and the head product comprising methanol.<br>
The head product is recycled back to the reaction step of propene<br>
epoxidation.<br>
The catalytic hydrogenation is preferably carried out as a heterogeneous<br>
catalytic hydrogenation at a hydrogen partial pressure of 0.5 to 30 MPa.<br>
It is particularly preferred to conduct the hydrogenation step at a<br>
temperature in the range of 80°C and 150°C, preferably 100°C to 180°C<br>
and at a hydrogen partial pressure of 1 to 25 MPa.<br>
Suitable hydrogenation catalysts are selected from supported catalysts<br>
comprising one or more of metals selected from the group consisting of<br>
Ru, Rh. Pd, Pt, Ag, Ir, Fe, Cu, Ni and Co. Alternatively Raney Nickel<br>
and Raney Cobalt both optionally being doped with one or more of the<br>
above mentioned can be used. The catalyst support is preferably selected<br>
from activated carbon and metal oxides selected from Si02, Ti02, Zr02 and<br>
A1203, mixed oxides comprising at least two of Si, Al, Ti and Zr and<br>
mixtures thereof.<br>
The hydrogenation can be carried out continuously or batch-wise e.g., in<br>
a suspension method or a fixed-bed method. It is especially preferred<br>
to use a trickle-bed reactor. The fixed-bed catalysts to be used therein<br>
are preferably pellets with a diameter of 0.5 to 5 mm, especially 1 to<br>
3 mm and with a length of 1 to 10 mm. The noble-metal content is in the<br>
customary range, preferably 0.5 to 5% by weight.<br>
In a further embodiment of the epoxidation process the bottom product<br>
from the C3 stripper is mixed with an aqueous alkaline solution and the<br>
mixture is reacted for 1-200 minutes at a temperature from 20-100°C<br>
before being fed to the extractive distillation column. The aqueous<br>
alkaline solution is preferably an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide<br>
containing 0.1-2 percent by weight sodium hydroxide. Preferably the<br>
amount of sodium hydroxide is chosen to give a molar ratio of sodium<br>
hydroxide relative to the amount of methyl formate contained in the<br>
C3 stripper bottoms in the range from 1.1-4.<br>
