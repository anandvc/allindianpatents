				<td>This invention relates to human medicine, and particularly with a pharmaceutical combination between Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) and a Growth Hormone secretagogue hexapeptide (GHRP); being useful to prevent tissue damages due to blood flow suppression and to enhance tissue repair following ischaemic damages.<br>
All the organs in the animal body are susceptible to lethal irreversible tissue damages following partial or full-arterial blood flow deprivation, or due to venous drainage failure. In these scenarios, cellular death is the aftermath of a progressive cascade of pathophysiological changes, which may eventually threaten appropriate multi-organ functioning and individual's survival. Exaggerated ROS generation is a key pathological consequence of a myriad of processes linked to tissue hypoperfusion, ischemia/reperfusion, and inflammation (peritonitis, pancreatitis, etc). Tissue hypoperfusion and ROS over-production are also associated to major surgery, revascularization surgery, extensive burns and multiple traumas. Membranes lipid peroxidation by ROS attack is responsible for cellular demise in many pathologic conditions (T. D. Lucas and I. L. Szweda. Cardiac reperfusion injury. Aging, lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial dysfunction. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1998, 95 (2): 510-514).<br>
Depletion of cellular ATP stores is the most acute and threatening consequence of ischemia (Burns TA, Davies RD, McLaren JA, Cerundolo L, Morris JP, Fuggle VS. Apoptosis in ischemia/reperfusion injury of human renal allografts. Transplantation. 1998, 66 (7): 872-876). Along the ischaemic process, ATP stores are degraded to hypoxantine and xantine, both acting as substrates for the enzyme xantine oxidase (XO). The large availability of incoming molecular oxygen during the reperfusion period leads to purines oxidation via XO activation, resulting in superoxide anion and hydrogen<br>
peroxide generation (Paller MS, Hoidall JR, Ferris JE. Oxygen free radicals in ischaemic acute renal failure in the rat. J Clin Invest 1994, 74: 1156-1164.). During ischemia/reperfusion periods ROS generation and microvascular failure combine to act as vicious circle, in which activated endothelial cells and circulating leukocytes recruitment/adhesion further increase territorial tissue perfusion and thus cellular hypoxia (Redl H, Gasser H, Hallstrom S, Schlag G. Radical related cell injury. In Pathobiology of shock, sepsis and organ failure. G. Schlag, H. Redl, editors. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg. Germany 1993, 92-110); (Ledebur HC, Parks TP. Transcriptional regulation of the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 gene by inflammatory cytokines in human endothelial cells: essential roles of a variant NF-kB site and p65 homodimers. J Biol Chem 1995,270:933-943).<br>
ROS may activate NF-kB in tissues infiltrated by inflammatory cells (Conner EM, Brand SJ, Davis JM, Kang DY, Grisham MB. Role of reactive metabolites of oxygen and nitrogen in inflammatory bowel disease: toxins, mediators, and modulators of gene expression. Inflamm Bowel Dis 1996, 2: 133-147), whereas the myeloperoxidase (MPO) enzyme system is activated in polymorphonuclear cells infiltrating hypoxic tissues which further amplifies tissue damage cascade (Kurose I, Argenbright LW, Wolf R, Lianxi L, Granger DN. Ischemia/reperfusion-induced microvascular dysfunction: role of oxidants and and lipid mediators. Am J Physiol 1997, 272: H2976-H2982). In this hostile environment local thrombogenic mechanisms are activated which results in capillary plugging and hypoxia territorial expansion. As a consequence of this cascade, cellular death ensues by necrosis and/or apoptosis, which may compromise organ's viability (Tredger MJ. Ischaemia-reperfusion injury of the liver: treatment in theory and practice. Biofactors 1998, 8 (1-2): 161-164). Endothelial / inflammatory cells reactivity renders a large number of chemical soluble mediators such nitric oxide, proinflammatory cytokines, pro-coagulant and vasoactive agents which may trigger the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) if the body is incapable of counteracting its immune dissonance (Kowal-Vern A, McGill V, Gamelli RL. Ischemic necrotic bowel disease in thermal injury. Archives of Surgery 1997, 132 (4): 440-443).<br>
Major burns are medical emergencies demanding intensive and multiple medical efforts to save patient's life. In burned patients, gut hypoperfusion / ischemia seems to play a critical role in orchestrating the SRIS (Wang P, Ba ZF, Cioffi WG, Bland Kl, and Chaudry IH. Is gut the "motor" for producing hepatocellular dysfunction after trauma and hemorrhagic shock? Journal of Surgical Research 1998, 74: 141-148). Intestinal barrier failure is of paramount clinical relevance as gut epithelium acts as a frontier between a septic/toxic lumen and a sterile internal environment (Sheridan RL, Ryan CM, Yin LM, Hurley J, Tompkins RG. Death in the burn unit. Sterile multiple organ failure. Burns 1998, 24 (4): 307-311).<br>
In this regard, both experimental and clinical findings converge to show the importance of an adequate intestinal perfusion during systemic stress as to preserve barrier integrity (Tabata T, de Serres S, Meyer AA. Differences in IgM synthesis to gut bacterial peptidoglycan ploysaccharide after burn injury and gut ischemia. Journal of Burn Care and Rehabilitation 1996, 17 (3): 231-236). Furthermore, recent evidences also indicate that intestinal tissue acts as a pro-inflammatory cytokine-generating source when intestinal-associated lymphoid tissue is activated by ischemia. MOF is a first cause of death in patients admitted under intensive care conditions, and is the most frequent complication for burn victims, involving up to a 70% of patients in highly specialized burn treatment units.<br>
In order to attenuate the consequences of the ischemia/reperfusion process in certain organs, a large number of synthetic or natural compounds have been pre-clinically or clinically examined. For the case of intestinal ischemia, angiotensin II inhibitors were experimentally evaluated (Tadros T, Taber DL, Heggers JP, Herndon DN. Angiotensin II inhibitor DuP753 attenuates burn and endotoxin-induced gut ischemia, lipid peroxidation, mucosal permeability and bacterial translocation. Ann Surg 2000; 231: 566-576). Platelet activating factor inhibitors (Sun Z, Wang X, Deng X, Lasson A, Soltesz V, Borjesson A, Andersson R Beneficial effects of lexipafant, a PAF antagonist on gut barrier dysfunction causewd by intestinal ischemia and reperfusion in rats. Dig Surg 2000; 17: 57-65), and enhancers of the nitric oxide release were also studied (Ward DT, Lawson SA, Gallagher CM, Conner WC, Shea-Donohue DT.<br>
Sustained nitric oxide production via L-arginine administration ameliorates effects of intestinal ischemia-reperfusion. J Surg Res 2000; 89: 13-19). Other approaches include anti-oxidant therapy such as allopurinol alone or in combination with vitamins C and E (Kacmaz M, Otzurk HS, Karaayvaz M, Guven C, Durak I. Enzymatic antioxidant defense mechanism in rat intestinal tissue is changed after ischemia-reperfusion. Effects of allopurinol plus antioxidant combination. Can J Surg 1999; 42: 427-431). Despite this, efforts forwarded to spark cellular natural defensive mechanisms are scarce (Pialli SB, Hinmn CE, Luquette MH, Nowicki PT, Besner GE. Heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor protects rat intestine from ischemia/reperfusion injury. J Surg Res1999; 87: 225-231). Renal demise following ischemia/reperfusion has fueled the search for nephroprotective agents, including the generation of the so-called lazaroids, which have shown to confer global protection to the ischaemic kidney (De Vecchi E, Lubatti L, Beretta C, Ferrero S, Rinaldi P, Galli K M, Trazzi R, Paroni R. Protection from renal ischemia-reperfusion injury by the 2-methylaminochroman U83836. Kidney Int 1998, 54: 857-863). Other studies document the salutary effects of teofilin in renal protection, chiefly as an antagonist to adenosine receptors (Jenik AG, Ceriani JM, Gorenstein A, ramirez JA, vain N, Armadans M, Ferraris JR. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the effect of theophylline on renal function in term neonates with perinatal asphyxia. Pediatrics 2000; 105: E45). Administration of the atrial natriuretic peptide (Auriculin) did not show to reduce mortality in-patients affected by acute renal failure. Neither remote organs complications were reduced (Weisberg LS, Allgren RL, Genter FC, Kurnik BR. Cause of acute tubular necrosis affects its prognosis. The Auriculin Anaritide Acute Renal Failure Study Group. Arch Intern Med 1997; 157: 1833-1839). Nephorprotection has been attributed to the enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) when injected at high dose levels in patients undergoing renal transplantation surgery (Schneeberger H, Schleibner S, Miner WD, Messmer K, land W. The impact of free-radical mediated reperfusion injury on acute and chronic rejection events following cadaveric renal transplantation. Clin Transpl 1993; 219-232).<br>
The benefits of EGF and TGF-alpha in ameliorating toxic and ischaemic acute renal failure are shown in Patent No US 5,360,790. Although the parenteral administration of some growth factors exhibiting nephroprotective effects has proved to be effective in experimental models, clinical results are discouraging so far. A controlled multicenter clinical trial did not show the expected benefits of IGF-I in acute renal failure patients when compared to placebo counterparts (Hirschberg R, Kopple J, Lipsett P, Benjamin E, Minei J, Albertson T, Munger M, Meztler M, Zaloga G, Murray M, Lowry S, et al. Multicenter clinical trial of recombinant human insulin-like growth factor I in patients with acute renal failure. Kidney Int 1999; 55:2423-2432). In a further clinical trial employing IGF-I for acute renal failure, the lack of effect was confirmed (Kopple JD, Hirschberg R, Guler HP, Pike M, and Chiron Study Group: lack of effect of recombinant human insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in patients with acute renal failure (ARF). J Am Soc Nephrol 1996; 7:1375). Scarce progresses in organ preservation technology achieved thus far remains as the most important limitation of new organ availability for transplantation. Furthermore, ex-vivo preservation agents have yielded conflicting effects (Schlumpf-R; Candinas-D; Weber-M; Rothlin-M; Largiader-F. Preservation of kidney transplants with a modified UW solution initial clinical results. Swiss-Surg. 1995(4): 175-80; discussion 180-1); and organ biochemical and functional deterioration following implantation into the recipient, remains to be the first cause of non immune rejection (Barber E, Menendez S, Leon OS, Barber MO, Merino N, Calunga JL, Cruz E, and Bocci V. Prevention of renal injury after induction of ozone tolerance in rats submitted to warm ischemia. Mediators of Inflammation 1999; 8: 37-41). An untoward effect reported for some preservation agents is its interference in platelet aggregation mechanism, thus leading to profuse bleeding (Salat A, Mueller MR, Boehm D, Stangl P, Pulaki S, Laengle F. Influence of UW solution on in vitro platelet aggregability Transpl-lnt. 1996; 9 Suppl 1: S429-431). Vasospasm and thrombosis in the post-reperfused organ are amongst the inconveniences reported (Jeng-LB; Lin-PJ; Yao-PC; Chen-MF; Tsai-KT; Chang-CH. Impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation of human hepatic arteries after preservation with the University of Wisconsin solution. Arch-Surg.<br>
1997 Jan; 132(1): 7-12). The medical community still expects for more efficient and less expensive organ preservation solutions (Rentsch M, Post S, Palma P, Gonzalez AP, Menger MD, Messmer K. Intravital studies on beneficial effects of warm Ringer's lactate rinse in liver transplantation. Transpl Int. 1996; 9(5): 461-7). The failure of IGF-I in affording an efficient nephroprotective effect in the clinical arena has introduced the notion that therapy with a single growth factor is not sufficient to stimulate cellular survival during ischemia/reperfusion, and that growth factors cocktails will be more efficacious (Playford RJ. Peptides and gastrointestinal mucosa integrity. Gut 1995, 37: 595-597).<br>
The salutary effects of Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) in protecting organ damages during ischemia/reperfusion episodes was claimed by European patent EP 0 357 240 B1. However, cerebral protection is only achieved with very high EGF concentrations (1 mg/kg). A lower dose of 0.1 mg/kg only showed a modest protective effect despite the dose is still high for a substance like a growth factor. These facts impose limitations to the invention, the first one is related to the high cost of the treatment as repeated injections (4 to 5) are required to achieve an effect in the animal. As an example, a 70-kg human subject would require 70 mg of EGF in a single injection, which will have to be periodically repeated to ensure a clinical effect. The second limitation is pharmacologic. The examples shown in the patent suggest that there is a very narrow therapeutic window that hinders the possibility of establishing an Effective Dose 50 (ED50) and a dose-response curve. A third limitation is that associated with the high EGF doses. Reports exist demonstrating that in rats and monkeys EGF may depress heart out-put and arterial pressure (Keiser JA, Ryan NJ. Hemodynamic effect of EGF in conscious rats and monkeys. PNAS USA 1996; 93(10): 4957-4961). Normal cell cycle progression may also be perturbed by high concentrations of EGF (Bennett NT, Schultz GS. Growth factors and wound healing: Biochemical properties of growth factors and their receptors. Am J Surg 1993, 165:728-737). The potential benefits of EGF intervention in order to protect the liver and the intestines against ischemia/reperfusion seem to expect of elucidation. Mounting evidences indicate that the parenteral administration of EGF seem<br>
to confer protection to a variety of internal epithelial organs following acute blood flow suppression. In experimental conditions animals exposed to chemical, which block the ATP synthesis or increase the rate for EROs generation, EGF intervention proved to be useful by reducing organs damages. Furthermore, repeated EGF administrations assist in enhancing tissue regeneration, adaptation and functionality. All of these benefits of EGF therapy may only be achieved under repeated administration regimes and high concentrations of the polypeptide. Often, these benefits are modest, which further strengthen the notion that a combined therapy of growth factors is rather preferable.<br>
In the context of ischemia, EGF seems to attenuate tissue damage if ischemia time is less than 60 minutes. For larger ischemia periods EGF therapy is worthless. This is an obvious limitation for EGF therapy as protection for larger ischaemic periods is required in the surgical practice.<br>
Although the need of growth factors combination has been emphatically claimed for a large period of time, there is no combination available in the clinical armamentarium.<br>
The novelty of the present pharmaceutical composition is given by the pharmacological synergy set forth by the combination of Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) and a Growth Hormone secretagogue peptide (six) (GHRP-6). This combination enhances cellular viability in organs or tissues, which have undergone partial of full suppression of blood, supply for a period of minutes to hours. This combination reduces or prevents EROs generation as other toxic metabolites in hypoxic or anoxic organs, which stimulates cell survival during ischaemic periods. The combination of these two peptides exerts a potent synergistic activity in enhancing organ adaptation; i.e., intestinal adaptation following extensive traumas and the repair process.<br>
By mean of a prophylactic pre-conditioning intervention, the combination of the peptides allows for the activation of cellular self-defensive mechanisms, thus increasing cellular tolerance to cytotoxic agents or stressful conditions. Thus, by cellular preconditioning this combination turns into non-lethal what otherwise is lethal under ordinary conditions. This allows for the applicability of this combination to organs or organisms undergoing critical and threatening<br>
conditions as ischemia, low flow states, shock, hemodynamic failure, etc. Beside the protective effects of the combination, it enhances tissue repair, regeneration and functional adaptation following traumas. Subjects exhibiting extensive burn injuries, multiple traumas, shock, are tributary to receive the combination as soon as possible in order to attenuate the ongoing cascade of internal organs damages as to prevent or delay the onset of multiple organ failure. Subjects elected for major or prolonged surgery, extra-corporeal circulatory machine support, etc, must receive the present combination in order to ameliorate the risks for splanchnic and other internal organ damages as to attenuate the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome. The combination is applicable as well to attenuate organ/tissue damages associated to thrombosis and embolism once the appropriate thrombolytic therapy is established.<br>
Due to the synergistic effect of the peptides in relation to trophic/regenerative actions, this combination is useful to accelerate intestinal adaptation in short bowel patients. Regeneration of hepatic mass and of renal tubular system may also be stimulated by the combination.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of this invention, a pharmaceutical composition combines in a single product EGF and GHRP-6, which exert a potent cytoprotective action on tissues and organs exposed to hypoxic or anoxic events. The combination affords cytoprotection by different mechanisms, which are up regulated following a single pre-conditioning dosification. The combination may be associated to any of the standard antioxidant therapeutic modalities.<br>
On the other hand, the therapeutic administration of the combination when oriented to stimulate tissue regeneration requires of repeated administrations. The referred EGF encompasses that of natural, synthetic or recombinant origins. The referred secretagogue peptide is the hexapeptide having the following aminoacid sequence: His-D-Trp-Ala-Trp-D-Phe-Lys-NH2. It is referred as GHRG-6 as abbreviation of growth hormone releasing peptide. The combination also refers to the independent administration of both peptides to a single individual but within a single therapeutic scheme.<br>
When the combination is prophylactically applied to prevent ischaemic tissue damage, the EGF concentration in the pharmaceutical combination is between 0.5 and 50 µg/ml irrespective to its presentation as a lyophilized salt or as a solution. GHRP-6 concentration may range from 2-100 µg/ml in the same vehicle. Dose ranges of 0.5 and 1 µg/kg are recommended for both EGF and GHRP-6 for prophylactic goals.<br>
The combination must be administered as a bolus. Administration routes may involve peripheral or deep veins, intra-arterial and or/intraperitoneal. Vehicles to be used for administrations include: normal saline solution, lactated Ringer solution, human plasma, human albumin solution, 5% dextrose, or mixtures thereof.<br>
In order to ensure the highest efficacy of the therapy, the first administration should be done as soon as possible when ischemia is diagnosed, suspected or when it will be surgically created. For patients bearing extensive burn, multiple traumas, shock, etc, the treatment should be initiated despite the absence of any clinical or complementary indication of splanchnic ischemia as a prophylactic intervention. Patients bearing non-septic pancreatitis are also tributary of the treatment under the above specifications. Prophylactic administration schedule may fluctuate according to the severity of the clinical picture and/or the magnitude of the aggression, which are at discretion of a professional skilled in the art. Bolus administration can be repeated every 6 hours as to complete four administrations per day. It is necessary to maintain a lag period of 6 hours between each application. The combination of peptides can be administered using slow release technology devices. The combination of the products, if lyophilized must be resuspended prior use.<br>
As previously described when the combination is for therapeutic goals, which means that its use is aimed to stimulate regeneration and adaptation, treatments must be preferably administered via slow release systems or through alternative means as to ensure a bi-compartimental equilibrium of phases. Bolus infusions are not effective to stimulate tissue regeneration. If venous lines are used, administration period must be calibrated to last for about 4 hours. More than two administrations in a 24 hours period can be<br>
carried out if a clearance period of at least 8 hours is in between the treatments. Recommended doses of both peptides for regeneration are 0.01 µg/kg/h up to 5 µg/kg/h. These administration and dosing regimes allows to restore tissue damages due to ischemia in which necrosis and or/apoptosis are involved. When tissues are exposed to brief ischemia periods, administering the combination interrupts further complications. The use of the combination is recommended following transplantation surgery as to enhance anastomotic healing, tissue regeneration, and re-adaptation of the implanted organ.<br>
Repeated administrations of the combination are also recommended to treat the short bowel syndrome and the acute intestinal failure following large intestinal surgery.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1. Cytoprotective effect of the GH secretagogue hexapaptide<br>
(GHRP-6) in an animal model of acute gastric stress damage.<br>
Adult, male OF-1 mice (20-23 g) were randomly assigned to receive GHRP-6 (0.1 ug/animal) or normal saline solution 0.9% (both i.p.). Ten to thirty minutes later animals were forced to swim in cold water for 30 minutes and later restrained for another 20 minutes period at 4°C. Animals were thereafter anesthetized and killed for gastric mucosa inspection. Samples were 10 % buffered formalin fixed and H&amp;E, and PAS stained for microscopic study. Erosion, hemorrhage, and ulceration were the gross pathology criteria considered in the experiment (Playford RJ. Peptides and gastrointestinal mucosa integrity. Gut 1995, 37: 595-597). Microscopic ulceration was only considered when involved deeper than the first third of the glandular mucosa. Luminal bleeding was studied by measuring hemoglobin by the cyano metahemoglobin method (Reactivos Spinreact, Barcelona). Data were expressed in g/dL. All the determinations were done in a blind fashion using a sham code.<br>
As shown in table 1, GHRP-6 significantly reduced the intensity of the mucosal damage as the number of ulcer on the oxyntic mucosa.<br>
Table 1. Gastroprotective effect of the systemically administered GHRP-6<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
A total of 20 mice were used for each group. * p
This experiment demonstrates the cytoprotective effect of the GHRP-6, expressed on the gastric mucosa of animals exposed to a severe systemic stress. Gastric mucosa ischemia/reperfusion has been implicated in the pathophysiology of this acute damage model.<br>
Example 2. Protective effect of the prophylactic adminstration of EGF and GHRP-6 in an animal model of renal ischemia/reperfusion.<br>
Experimental Design:<br>
The potential nephroprotective effects of each of the peptides alone or in<br>
combination was studied in a rat model of renal bilateral ischemia/reperfusion.<br>
In a first phase trial and ischemia period of 1 hour followed by a 3 hours<br>
reperfusion period was established.   Female Wistar rats (200-220 g) were<br>
randomly assigned to the following experimental groups (N=10):<br>
Group I: Sham ischaemic.<br>
Group II: Ischaemic and normal saline solution 0.9%.<br>
Group III: Ischaemic and EGF - 20 µg/rata.<br>
Group IV: Ischaemic and GHRP-6 - 50 µg/rata.<br>
Group V: Combination between EGF (5 µg) y GHRP-6 (10 µg).<br>
All the treatments were intraperitoneally administered 30 minutes before<br>
ischemia.<br>
Ischemia Model<br>
Renal arteries were clamped with microvascular clamps (Moria, Fine Science<br>
Tools, USA) for 60 minutes. Completed 3 hours of reperfusion the animals<br>
were monitored for other 30 minutes to establish renal functioning.<br>
Renal functioning<br>
Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and the renal plasmatic flow (RPF) were<br>
studied  using molecular weight markers as  inulin  and  p-amino hypuric.<br>
Clearance coefficient were determined as follows:<br>
C= Uv (m) x [PM]u / [PM]p<br>
Uv(m) maximal urine volume per minute.<br>
[PM]u and [PM]p represents plasma and urine concentrations of each marker<br>
Data are expressed as ml/min/g de peso.<br>
Diuresis volume:<br>
A catheter was fixed in the urinary bladder and the urethra was clamped. The<br>
free end of the catheter was inserted in a graduated tube and the urine volume<br>
was collected during 10 minutes.<br>
Biochemical determinations:<br>
Renal tissue samples were homogenized in KCI/histidine (pH7.3) buffer and<br>
the supernatant used to measure the activity of the enzymes PLA2, catalase,<br>
as the MDA reactive metabolite.<br>
Histological Determinations:<br>
Renal tissue samples were 10 % buffered formalin fixed, paraffin embedded,<br>
H&amp;E stained and studied by independent pathologists using the following<br>
criteria:   number  of  collapsed   glomeruli,   cortical   hemorrhage,   medullar<br>
hemorrhage, severe tubular damage, and severe interstitial damage.<br>
As  shown   in  table  2,   ischemia/reperfusion   event  provoked   a  marked<br>
deterioration   of   the   renal   urine   formation   capacity.   EGF   intervention<br>
attenuated  the  oliguria with  respect to  saline-treated   controls.   GHRP-6<br>
intervention increased urine formation 4 times as compared to saline treated<br>
animals, which argues in favor of renal functional protection. EGF / GHRP-6<br>
combined administration showed to completely prevent renal failure so that<br>
diuresis was similar to a non-ischaemic reference group. These data confirm the synergistic effect of the present peptide combination. Table 2: Urine out put during the reperfusion period.<br>

The microscopic examination showed that ischemia affected the three main structures of the kidney: glomeruli, tubular apparatus, and the interstitial tissue. Damages were severe in animals receiving saline. Both EGF and GHRP-6 showed to confer renal protection to the animals assigned to each independent treatment. In general and qualitative terms GHRP-6 seems to afford larger protection to the renal parenchyma than EGF alone. The combination of both peptides is steadily better in comparison to each agent alone. Data are shown in table 3. Table 3: Percent of animals/group showing renal tissue damage.<br>

From the histopathological point of view, the renal damages were massive and<br>
severe in most of the animals. Protection in qualitative terms was detected as<br>
follows: Peptide Combination / GHRP-6 / EGF. Out of the animals receiving<br>
the peptide combination, protection by EGF and GHRP-6 was negligible when<br>
independently given.  In table 6 are shown the data demonstrating the<br>
protection conferred by the peptide combination.<br>

Renal functional analysis showed again that the peptide combination ensured<br>
appropriate rates of glomerular blood flow and tubular filtration. Even under<br>
the present ischemia conditions these functional markers were within normal<br>
ranges as detected in the sham ischaemic animals. Data are shown in table 7.<br>

This study has confirmed the superiority of the peptide combination  in<br>
preventing renal structural damages and functional demise by prolonged<br>
ischemia/reperfusion periods.<br>
Example 3. Protective effect of the EGF/GHRP-6 combination in an intestinal ischemia / reperfusion model.<br>
Male Sprague Dawley (220-250 g) rats were randomly assigned to the following treatment groups: I: ischemia/normal saline.<br>
II: Ischemia EGF 500 (jg/rat. Ill: lschemia/GHRP-6 100 ug/rat.<br>
IV: Ischemia/ combination -EGF (5 ug) / GHRP-6 (2 µg) / rat. All the treatments were intraperitoneally administered 30 minutes prior to initiate the ischemia period. Experimental Model:<br>
Under methoxyfluorane anesthesia and thermal blanket, a careful laparatomy was practiced to expose the first order branch of the mesenteric superior artery. The artery was clamped for a period of 2 hours, thus provoking a severe ischemia time on the jejunum and ileum portions of the small intestine. Reperfusion was allowed for 3 hours. Rats were terminated and subjected to complete autopsy. Small intestine was resected and the length of hemorrhagic mucosal and/or luminal damage was registered. Luminal content was flushed out with a standard volume of saline to determine the hemoglobin content. Intestinal mucosa was washed with warm normal saline, weighed and fragments used to determine total protein content by Lowry method. Other fragments were used for total DNA content and microscopic analysis. Villi/mucosal damage was microscopically analyzed as described by Chiu. This scale considers Grade 0 as intact mucosa progressing to Grade 5 as full-thickness denudation.<br>
In order to fully elucidate the protective effect of the combination treatment in this model of intestinal ischemia/reperfusion, survival was monitored until 96 hours of reperfusion.<br>
Animals receiving normal saline were seriously affected by the ischemia/reperfusion period used here, exhibiting a transmural ulcer with total denudation and profuse bleeding. As shown in table 8, most of the intestinal segments studied in this group exhibited a grade 5-damage pattern. EGF treatment conferred a minimal protection, which in the clinical practice seems irrelevant. EGF intervention provided a minimal effect. A partial protection was evidenced in animals receiving the GHRP-6 so that mucosal damage was more superficial and more circumscribed. Again, the peptide combination significantly reduced mucosal damages (table 8). All the criteria used in the<br>
study   confirm   that   the   peptide   combination   confers   a   remarkable cytoprotective effect along the ischemia/reperfusion event. Table 8. Intestinal damage parameters.<br>

multiple range test.<br>
Microscopic examination of the main internal organs demonstrated a close<br>
correspondence between the magnitude of the intestinal damage and the<br>
extra intestinal changes found in remote organs. The principal damages found<br>
attenuated in animals treated with the combination were:    (I) neutrophilic<br>
infiltration in lungs parenchyma, (II) prevention of hepatocyte oncosis  y (III)<br>
prevention of glomerular tuft collapse and tubular changes.<br>
A second and independent experiment was conducted in order to learn if the<br>
combination stimulated animals' survival. Experimental methodology is as<br>
described above. All the rats received and intraperitoneal injection of lactated<br>
Ringer following wound closure. Animals were monitored for 96 hours once<br>
reperfusion was initiated. The  100% of the  rats  receiving the peptide combination survived 96 hours and beyond. (Table 9). Table 9: Survival per group.<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
The pathology study of these animals confirmed previous findings in that the peptide combination not only afforded a steady intestinal protection by reducing the onset of necrotic changes. Furthermore, damages in lungs and kidneys as remote target organs affected by neutrophilic recruitment were also attenuated. These findings confirm the systemic and multi-organic protection triggered by the EGF/GHRP-6 combination.<br>
Example 4. Effect of the therapeutic administation of the EGF/GHRP-6 in an experimental model of multiple organ damage by extensive burn.<br>
The dorsal region of Balb/c mice (22-25 g) was depilated and subjected to<br>
hypodermic scalding involving a 25% of body surface area, by immersion in<br>
equilibrated water at 95-97°C for 5 seconds. All the mice received 1.5 ml of<br>
normal saline solution as fluid resuscitation immediately after. This animal<br>
model had been previously established and calibrated in our laboratory, and is<br>
useful to our goals as extensive internal changes are steadily reproduced. On<br>
the next 24 hours the surviving mice were randomly assigned to the following<br>
groups:<br>
Reference. Sham burned mice receiving saline 0.9% (N=5).<br>
Scalded receiving only normal saline 0.9%. (N=7)<br>
Scalded and treated with EGF (N= 10; 0.1 ug EGF /animal).<br>
Scalded and treated with GHRP-6 (N= 9; 0.1 ug GHRP-6/animal).<br>
Scalded, treated with the peptide combination   (N=10). EGF (0.01 ug) and<br>
GHRP-6 (0.01 ug).<br><br>
Administrations were done twice a day and until day 10th post-scalding. Once<br>
the treatments were completed animals were weighed again and terminated<br>
for necropsy and microscopic examination. Six hours prior to death, every<br>
mouse received an injection of vincristine (1   mg/kg) to arrest cells on<br>
metaphase.  Intestines were resected, flushed and weighed. Fragments were<br>
collected for total DNA and protein content. Other fragments were formalin<br>
fixed and used for routine processing or for intestinal microdisection of villi and<br>
crypts. Morphometric procedures on the microscopic slides were derived from<br>
the DIGIPAT image processing system.<br>
The following parameters were considered in this study:<br>
Animals weight.<br>
Intestinal weight, protein and DNA content.<br>
Number of cells in metaphase per crypt.<br>
Number of branching crypts.<br>
Villous height.<br>
Crypts depth.<br>
All the mice receiving EGF, GHRP-6 alone or in combination showed a<br>
significant body weight increase at the end of the experiment. The difference<br>
was even larger in those animals receiving both peptides. These data are<br>
shown in table 10. This finding indicates the trophic effect exerted by the<br>
combination on the intestinal mucosa.<br>

The most relevant evidence of this experiment is the demonstration that the<br>
peptide combination accelerates intestinal growth and adaptation given by the<br>
stimulation of the crypt fission process along the small intestine and the colon.<br>
The crypt is the growth and proliferative unit of the intestinal mucous and is as<br>
well the morphological substantiation of intestinal mass adaptation. Table 12<br>
shows the data referring the morphological reconstitution of the intestines. Villi<br>
and crypts enlargements are in correspondence with tissue regeneration and<br>

The present invention has the following advantages:<br>
1.	The combination may exert prophylactic and/or therapeutic effects, which<br>
may depend on the requisites to be met of the pathologic condition to be<br>
treated. The effects are easily modulated by the administration regime by a<br>
professional skilled in the art.<br>
2.	The method to induce cellular protection is based on the stimulation of self-<br>
defensive mechanism in every cell of the body. The mechanisms to be<br>
activated are different but functionally redundant. Many previous solutions for<br>
cell protection introduce foreign chemical structures (xenobiotic).<br>
3.	Small doses are enough to induce the expected therapeutic response with<br>
no risk of toxicity. Peptides have proved to be safe at very high doses in<br>
different mammals' species. Previous interventions require higher closes for modest effect.<br>
4.	Biological response is quickly activated upon the interaction of both EGF and GHRP-6 to a specific cell receptor. This precludes the need of prolonged exposures to the peptides, reducing toxic risks.<br>
5.	The peptide combination does not have contraindications and may be used in any subject with no risk. No unwanted drug interaction may occur.<br>
6.	The method is to be used for a very wide range of common clinical conditions and comorbidity, many of them with no available therapeutic choice so far.<br>
7.	The method is indicated for a number of pathology conditions including those patients undergoing transplantation surgery<br>
8.	The cytoprotective effects of the present invention have a wide therapeutic window in terms of protection time against ischemia/reperfusion. Protection time meets the current clinical needs for transplantation, re-vascularization, diagnostic maneuvers, management procedures, etc.<br>
9.	From the mechanistic point of view the combination may counteract the<br>
ischemia/reperfusion damage cascade in different critical points, which turns<br>
its pharmacologic mechanisms as polyvalent and thus efficacious.<br>
10.	The use of the present combination is unique as a trophic/regenerative agent for many epithelial organs as the gut, liver, pancreas and kidney.<br>
11.	The present combination has proved to be useful for short bowel syndrome correction / intestinal adaptation. This process does not have any alternative choice in the current clinical practice.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
