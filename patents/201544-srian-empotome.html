				<td>SRIAN    EMPOTOME<br>
SYRIAN BMPOTOMB is the name given to the new invention, which incorporates unique features of scanning/imaging coupled with facilities for expeditious performance of neuro-surgical procedures  embodied as a single unit. This invention is a very unique  and  novel  idea in  the  field  of neurosurgery.<br>
SRIAN EMPOTOMB has a number of newer and useful features, which were hitherto not available in the existing craniotomes. This Empotome is not only an improvement of the existing craniotomes, but also possesses additional novel structures, expeditiously facilitating neuro-surgical procedures. The existing craniotomes, available at present, which are used in neuro¬surgical operations, are able to drill only a single burr-hole [making hole in the skull during opening of a skull J at a time and there is no    facility    to    visualize    the    dura    Afum - the   outermost   layer of the   Brmu]<br>
during drilling in order to prevent injury to the dural structures in  the  brain.<br>
SRIAN EMPOTOMB on the other hand, improvises on this feature. The improvement incorporated in the "Empotome" is that, multiple burr-holes can be drilled on the skull, simultaneously, thus minimizing the time utilised. The dural il\jViry is also prevented by incorporating a endoscopic lens system with a light source in the burr itself, so that drilling may be stopped, as soon as the dura is vizualised or encountered. This is possible, by connecting the burr with a computer assisted system, which displays the surgical procedure on-line, on    a  video monitor / screen.<br><br>
"SRIAN BBIPOTOMB" further, has the facility to perform intra¬operative neurosurgical imaging of the cranio-spinal axis, utilising the CT and MRI facilities, which have been incorporated in the form of a 'cranial helmet' for visualizing the brain and a 'retractable spinal extension of the helmet' for visualizing  the  whole   spinal  cord.<br>
This form of imaging, utilizing CT Scan and MRI simultaneously in the same machine, at the same time, with facilities for super-imposition of both the CT and MRI images, is not only a new’ concept, but also, a very compact version of the existing intra-operative CT and MRI apparatus/es, which are hitherto available  as  separate units.<br>
The existing CT and MRI apparatus/es are very huge, {as huge as a large room} and a patient has to be shifted from the operating table, to the MRI or CT table [ also known as gantry ], in order to get an image of the brain or the spinal cord, as the circumstances may demand. Moreover the CT and MRI images cannot be obtained simultaneously from the same machine and also cannot be super imposed. This handicap has been removed in  the   Empotome.<br>
'SRIAN BMPOTOMB', has obliviated this shifting of the patient from the operating table, to the CT or MRI gantry, by incorporating the features of the CT and MRI on a very compact gadget, which is in the form of a helmet and a spinal extension, as stated earlier. The compactness of these gadgets viz., the helmet  and   the spinal   extension,   is   due   to   the   CT / MRI   plates<br><br>
which captures the image of the brain or the spinal cord and transmits it through the electronic connections, on to the screen, ‘vhich is a simultaneous activity and hence does not require the shifting of the patient, wrhich itself is a new concept, not  available  at  present.<br>
SRIAN BMPOTOMB, hence reduces the operative time and at the same time, performs the surgical procedures, expeditiously , without damaging the brain. The 'Empotome' also provides facilities for operational procedures of the brain and the spinal cord, without disturbing the patient from the operating table, hence facilitating intra-operative super-imposed CT and/or MRl imaging w’hich minimizes the trauma during shifting of the patient. These features provide an edge to the newly invented "Empotome"  over  the other  existing  craniotomes.<br>
SRZAif BBSPOTOMB is, thus, the name given to the apparatus luhich implies :<br>
CT Scanner &amp; Magnetic Resonance Imaging Attachments in Neuro Surgical<br>
apparatus   alongwtth Endoscopic Burrs   Ss    a   Multi Purpose    Cranio TOMES.<br>
Empotome, implies "Empo* + "tome", where "empo" refers to an abbreviated   and     mnemonic   form   of   the   letters   *m' and 'p',   in<br>
the	word	'multipurpose',	and	"tome"     -   aOo   medkaCfy   urmetC   otomy-<br>
suggesting 'cutting' or 'opening' during surgical procedures. Therefore, ISRIAN EMPOTOME" is a multi purpose apparatus comprising facilities for pre and/or intra-operative imaging alongwith features to facilitate early and expeditious surgery for opening  of the skull  and  operating upon the brain.<br><br>
THE    MOST   REVOLUTIONARY   FEATURES   OP   THIS   SRIAN EMPOTOMEARE :<br>
The SRIAN BMPOTOMB can be used in the pre-operative period [Before surgery], per-operative period [during surgery] and in the post¬operative period [after surgery] for imaging studies. The combined facilities of imaging and performance of craniotomies, are exclusive to this new invention viz., 'SRIAN BMPOTOMB', both of which are not available, in the same apparatus, in any of the available craniotomes, being presently used to perform brain surgeries, till date. Hence, the existing craniotomes ceut only be used to perform neurosurgical operations tma cannot be used for imaging studies. This handicap has been removed by this new’ invention, 'SRIAN BMPOTOME', apart from possessing new features,   which makes it  a  novel  invention.<br>
The imaging facilities alluded above include. Computed Tomography Scan [CTscan] 8B Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan [M(1(/ scan] of the cranium and also the imaging of the spinal axis, through which an on-line image of the brain and the spinal cord can be visualised, not only before or after cranio-spinal procedures, but also during the performance of cranio-spinal procedures on-table.<br>
This procedure of a combination of imaging and surgery, is extremely useful to assess the extent of surgery, the completeness of the surgery being performed and the requirement for future course of action during the process of surgery and also pre-emptive remedial measures that are to be taken to prevent injuries to the vital structures of the brain viz.,   the   motor-cortex,   the   sensory-cortex,   the speech   area,   the<br><br>
olfactory, auditory and visual centres, the limbic system, the ventricles, the supra-cranial and infra-cranial vascular structures, the brain stem which includes the mid-brain, pons and medulla, the cranial nerves, the dural-venous sinuses, the cerebellum, the spinal cord including the cervical spine, dorsal spine and the lumbo-sacral spine and also the spinal nerves and  the  coverings  of the  brain  and   spinal cord.<br>
Recognizing the importance of time and the need for a quick and expeditious craniotomy, w’hich are very important and vital factors in neuro-surgery, essential to prevent infection, blood loss, trauma secondary to retraction, cerebral edema etc., the 'SRIAN BMPOTOUS' embodies all the features of performing multiple burr-holes and imaging at that point of time, with precision  and  deftness,   combined  in    a  single  apparatus.<br>
The intra-operative imaging, facilitates the assessment of the completeness of resection of a particular tumor, the amount of residual tumor, the adjacent vital structures which have to be avoided during surgery, the surrounding and adjacent vascular structures which need to be avoided for preventing excessive hemorrhage etc. This prevents a second or subsequent operation, which minimises the risk of infection and trauma to the  brain.<br>
Additional important feature of this "SRIAN E’POTOMB" is that there is no necessity for the patient to be shifted out of the theatre for performing the MRI or CT scan. The image can be seen, as and when  the  operation is being performed.<br><br>
This imaging facility in the " SRIAN EMPOTOME" is highly compact which does not occupy the space of more than the size of a helmet, which can not only be used separately as an imaging machine, but can also be combined with a craniotome. The brain and the spinal cord can be im’ed simultaneously. This combined feature is not available in any of the existing intra-operative machines. This " SRIAN EMPOTOME" does not require additional space, as stated earlier, and the imaging structures are detachable, which facilitates easy maneuvering.<br>
1SRIAN EMPOTOME" has facilities for holding an endoscope, an intra¬operative sonar and a digital camera fis slots to place retractors. Besides being able to be operated upon, utilizing only electrical connections, it can also be connected to a computer for complete automation and three dimensional [ 3D ] visualisation.<br>
As alluded earlier, it not only works on electricity but also has additional connections to the UPS and a battery source. The working is based both on pneumatic &amp;   hydraulic principles.<br>
This new instrument can easily be mounted on any state of the art OT-Table 85 has all the facilities for performing cervical traction and for procedures on the neck, both before surgery and also while performing surgery, through a rotatable   and adjustable    neck-stand.<br>

These multiple diamond shaped structures act as scanners and the images can be procured from any angle viz., axial, saggital 8s coronal axes. It can take images in other axes also like oblique views, or in any particular axis or region of interest that were hither to considered unconventional. It also gives a super-imposed three dimensional image combining the facility of both the CT Scan and the MRI scan. This helps in visualizing both the bony structures  and  the   soft-tissue  structures in   great  detail.<br>
They also help in acquiring intra-operative CT / MRI images along with the helmet [ <r l and fig no. the spinal extension nos. through a remote sensor imager incorporated alongwith it helps in transferring imaging data. simultaneously images are displayed on screen operating room. this obviating strain of taking patient to ct mri room situated elsewhere. also getting acquiring real-time image cranium axis etc. w accurate adequate management. preventing one or more sittings separate days.></r>
HELMET    WITH   A   SPINAL   EiXTBNSION<br>
This again is a revolution in the history of neuro-surgery. A large hemispherical translucent helmet [ Vif 5Vb. l and Fig. No. 3 ] is attached to the head-ring. There is a foldable spinal extension [ 3?g’ 5Vb. 3 and Fig. Nos. 2 &amp; 3 ] along its posterior / inferior border to obtain / acquire images of the spinal area. The helmet and the spinal extension will obtain intra-operative CT / MRI images of the  cranium  emd  the   spinal  axis  respectively.<br><br>

METHOD   OF   PERFORMING   THE    PROCEDURE   UTILIZING THE    INVENTION   VIZ.. "SRIAN EMPOTOME"<br>
"SRlAN  EMPOTOME"   is   an  instrument   used in   Neuro-surgical    imaging<br>
and operations.<br>
Initially,   a   patient  who   requires   imaging / neuro-surgical   operation   is<br>
brought into the Operation Theatre [ OT ].<br>
The patient is made to he down on the OT table.<br>
The   "SRIAN   EMPOTOiyiE"    consisting   of   the     Head   Ring   and   the<br>
Neck  Ring,   is  inserted  from  above  downwards  over  the  head  of  the<br>
patient.<br>
The    Head    ring    mth    the    upper    and    the low’er    case    is    adjusted,<br>
according   to   the   size   of   the   head    of the patient,   using   the   slider<br>
available in   the "Srian Empotome".<br>
The  head   ring  is now fixed   to  the   head  of the patient by  utilizing  the<br>
head  ring fixator,  after giving  local anesthesia at the points  where the<br>
adjustable screw’ of the head-ring fixator penetrates into the skin of the<br>
skull of the patient.<br>
The adjustable screw’   provided in the fixator is moved either forwards /<br>
Jt?i’Jt&gt;vards,    so that    the head-ring    is    anchored    tightly,    allow’ing    no<br>
Mjovement of the head of the patient.<br>
The Neck ring w’ill now lie over the shoulders of the patient.<br>
The    distance    between    the    head    ring    and    neck    ring is    adjusted<br>
according to the need of the patient by the four verticzd rods.<br>
The   patient is   now’ made   to   Ue on the   Operation   Table   either   in   a<br>
supine  position  [Lying on one's 6ac’  so tRat the face is turned towards the roof]<br><br>
or  in  the  prone  position  [Cying on one's stomacfi or addbmen, so tfiat the face is<br>
turned towards the floor] depending upon the surgical needs.<br>
The neck ring is now attached to the neck stand  jind the height of the<br>
table and the patient is accordingly adjusted.<br>
After   this   rigid   immobilization of   the   head   emd   neck   of   the   patient,<br>
the   'helmet'   w’ith   the   'retractable   spinal   extension'   is   anchored   on   to<br>
the head ring.<br>
The   'retractable  spinal  extension' is  adjusted  in  such  a  w’ay  over  the<br>
OT table, so that there is no inconvenience caused when the patient Ues<br>
either in the supine or prone position.<br>
The   CT   and   MRl  plates  are now   fixed  in betw’een the  head and  neck<br>
ring   and    slided    along   the    vertical   grooved    slots   available   in   the<br>
vertical rods.<br>
This   apparatus   is   then connected   to   the   AC/   DC   /   Battery   /   UPS<br>
source as the case may be.<br>
The   apparatus   is now’  connected   to   the   computer   and   then  on   to   a<br>
monitor screen    in    the    OT,     so    that    the    images    are    seen    both<br>
instantaneously and as an   online image.<br>
It now’   requires   to assess   whether the patient needs<br>
(a)	only imaging or<br>
(b)	imaging and surgery<br>
(a) In   case,   the patient   requires   only   CT /   MRl   imaging, without   any immediate surgical intervention :<br>
&gt;	the machine is turned on,<br>
&gt;	the CT   and/or  MRl   images   of  the  head, facial  skeleton  and   the spine are obtained<br>
&gt;■   the   image is   seen   instantaneously   on   the   monitor   screen   and recorded   in   the   computer.   The     three-dimensional   CT + M R 1<br><br>
images   of   the   head,   facial   skeleton   and   the spine,   as   the  case may be, can be accurately visualized, (b) In case the patient requires both imaging and surgery :<br>
&gt;	The same procedure as in (a) above, is followed, initially<br>
&gt;	Thereupon, the marking of the flap, [ demar’ng the area on tfie brain which is to Be operated upon ] which is the most important initied step in neuro-surgery, in order to open the skull, is precisely done after imaging, on the Operating Table itself, after obtaining the three dimensional super-imposed CT + MRI pictures, which gives the bony details and the soft-tissue details of the brain. The 'helmef is now’ detached from the head-ring.<br>
&gt;	Depending on the case, either the brain, the neck or the spinal cord will be operated upon<br>
&gt;	During surgery,<br><br>
•	After marking the flap, the four burrs w’ith the burr-bits are placed in the slots available in the region of the upper case of the head ring.<br>
•	The skin flap is raised and the four burr bits are placed on the’kull to make four burr holes. The burr bits which are expauidable eavA retractable €ure placed and fixed in their respective positions, in order to prevent unnecessary movements.   This fixation is done, utilizing the fixobur.<br>
•	If more than four burr-holes are required, the procedure is repeated again or more number of burr-slots may be provided in the same upper case of the head ring , so that simultaneously more number of biu-rs can be performed.<br><br>
•	The burr bits and the fixobur can be moved in their respective slots provided in the upper case of the head ring.<br>
•	The burrs are turned on and the procedure of making the burr holes is begun. The chambers for air and w’ater provided in the lower case of the head ring facilitates a pneumatic as w’ell as hydraulic power required for the burr to drill the hole in the bone.<br>
•	The lens inside the burr with the endoscopic light source gives an online image of the burring process. As soon as the dura is encountered, it is visualized as a pearly white glistening structure. At this point of time the burring procedure is stopped.<br>
•	Utilizing a separate bone-cutter, the four burr holes are joined together, so that a bone flap is raised.<br>
•	Utilizing the sonzir appeiratus, the tumor cind the blood vessels are visualized through the dural cover.<br>
•	The dura is opened and the operation on the brain is begun.<br>
•	The images are taken during surgery and seen on the monitor, £is an online imaging process, so as to prevent injury to the vital structures as alluded to earlier. The completeness of the resection and the amount of residual tumor available, can all be made out easily.<br>
•	The brain can be retracted, utilizing the self-reteiiiung retractors which are provide in the slots available for the very purpose in the upper case of the head ring.<br><br>
•	Per chance, any power cuts are encountered, the UPS or the battery available in the lower case of the head ring, takes over and facilitates uninterrupted surgery / imaging.<br>
•	A digital camera and an endoscope can also be fixed in the slot provided in the head ring for taking per-operative pictures and visualizing the inner comers of the resected area, by the endoscope, in the brain, which may not be possible by CT or MRI imaging.<br>
•	the extent of resection of the tumor is accurately defined<br>
•	the vascular structures, adjacent to the tumors, can be visualized exactly.<br>
•	the important arteries, veins, vital structures of the brain Uke the motor cortex, sensory cortex, auditory cortex, visual cortex, speech area, ventricles, breiin stem {xvitA tHe mid-6rain, pons and medulla o6Congata) , cerebellum and spinal cord can be spared from being damaged during surgery, due to accurate visueilization.<br><br>
&gt;	The amount of residual tumor can be defined accurately<br>
&gt;	The presence / absence of post-operative compUcations Woe haemotoma in the tumor bed / collection of blood wlack increases t6e pressure inside the Brain ] can be detected early after completion of the surgery before shifting the patient out of the operating table.<br>
&gt;	When the neck or the spine [cervical dorsal lumSar or sacral] is being operated, the foldable spinal extension extending from the base of the 'helmef all along the length of the spinal column gives images, so that the surgical details are precisely localized.<br><br><br>
