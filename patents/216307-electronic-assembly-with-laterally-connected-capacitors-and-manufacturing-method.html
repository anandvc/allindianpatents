				<td>Electronic Assembly With Laterally Connected Capacitors and Manufacturing Method<br>
Technical Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to apparatus for providing capacitance to an electronic circuit, and<br>
more particularly to providing capacitance to an integrated circuit load, and methods of manufacturing an<br>
electronic assembly that includes discrete capacitors electrically attached to a housing.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Electronic circuits, and particularly computer and instrumentation circuits, have in recent years<br>
become increasingly powerful and fast. As circuit frequencies continue to escalate, with their associated<br>
high frequency transients, noise in the power and ground lines increasingly becomes a problem. This noise<br>
can arise due to inductive and capacitive parasitics, for example, as is well known. To reduce such noise,<br>
capacitors known as bypassing capacitors are often used to provide a stable signal or stable supply of power<br>
to the circuitry. Capacitors can also be used to suppress unwanted radiation, to dampen voltage overshoot<br>
when an electronic device (e.g., a processor) is powered down, and to dampen voltage droop when the<br>
device powers up.<br>
Bypassing capacitors are generally placed as close as practical to a die load or "hot spot" in order to<br>
increase the capacitors" effectiveness. Often, the bypassing capacitors are surface mounted to the die side or<br>
land side of the package upon which the die is mounted, or embedded within the package itself. Figure 1<br>
illustrates a cross-section of an integrated circuit package 102 having die side capacitors 106 ("DSC"), land<br>
side capacitors 108 ("LSC"), and embedded chip capacitors 110 ("ECC") in accordance with the prior art.<br>
Die side capacitors 106, as their name implies, are mounted on the same side of the package 102 as the<br>
integrated circuit die 104. In contrast, LSCs 108 are mounted on the opposite side of the package 102 as the<br>
die 104. ECCs 110 are embedded within the package 102.<br>
Typically, multiple bypassing capacitors are used to provide the desired capacitance. Figure 2<br>
illustrates a bottom view of an integrated circuit package 202 having multiple LSCs 204, which are<br>
electrically connected to pads 206 on the bottom of the package 202 in accordance with the prior art The<br>
terminals 208 of each capacitor 204 are connected to a different set of pads 206. The cross-hatching on<br>
terminals 208 is intended to indicate that terminals 208 and pads 206 typically are connected, in an<br>
alternating manner, to power and ground planes (not shown) within the package 202. Analogous figures<br>
could be used to illustrate the connection of DSC terminals to package pads, or the connection of ECC<br>
terminals to vias within the package.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates a cross-sectional view of a portion of the integrated circuit package 202 and<br>
LSCs 204 of Figure 2 along section lines 3-3. When LSCs are multi-layer capacitors, as shown, each<br>
capacitor 204 includes multiple planes 302, 304 of conductive material, separated by layers of dielectric<br>
material. Although only six planes are shown, numerous planes are usually present (e.g., hundreds of<br>
planes).<br>
Typically, conductive planes 302,304 are configured so that alternating planes connect to<br>
alternating terminals 306,308 around the capacitor. This enables terminals 306,308 and planes 302,304 to<br>
be connected, in an alternating manner, to pads 206 on the package body, as described in conjunction with<br>
Figure 2. Pads 206, in turn, connect to either power or ground planes 314,316 within the package body<br>
through plated or filled vias 318. Because the capacitors 204 are interconnected through different sets of<br>
pads 206, vias 318, and power or ground planes 314,316 within the package, some "lateral" inductance<br>
exists between the capacitors. In other words, the lateral current between capacitors 204 is carried over a<br>
conductive loop having a loop area that is bounded by various conductive structures (e.g., pads, vias, and<br>
power/ground planes) of the package 202. According to existing packaging technologies, where the package<br>
has one pair of power and ground planes 314,316, the loop area results in about 30 picohenrys (pH)/square<br>
of lateral inductance. Where the package has two pairs of power and ground planes 314,316 (as illustrated),<br>
the total lateral inductance can be reduced to about 15 pH/square.<br>
The capacitors" terminals 306,308 are also connected to the integrated circuit load (not shown)<br>
through vias 318, thus enabling the capacitors 204 to provide bypassing capacitance to the integrated circuit.<br>
Connection of the capacitors 204 to the load through the vias 318 results in some "vertical" inductance, also<br>
referred to as "loop" inductance, to exist in the supply and return via loop between each capacitor 204 and<br>
the integrated circuit load.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates an electrical circuit that simulates the electrical characteristics of the capacitors<br>
illustrated in Figures 1-3. For simplicity, no parasitic resistances of the capacitors are shown in Figure 4.<br>
The circuit shows a die load 402, which may require bypassing capacitance in order to function properly.<br>
Some of the bypassing capacitance can be supplied by capacitance, modeled by capacitor 404, located on thi<br>
die. Other capacitance, however, must be provided off chip, as modeled by off-chip capacitors 406. The<br>
off-chip capacitors 406 could be, for example, the DSCs 106, LSCs 108, and/or ECCs 110 illustrated in<br>
Figure 1.<br>
As described previously, lateral inductance, modeled by inductors 408, exists between capacitors<br>
406. In addition, vertical loop inductance, partially modeled by inductor 410, exists between capacitors 406<br>
and die load 402. For simplicity, a vertical loop inductance component for each capacitor is not shown.<br>
Because lateral and vertical inductances tend to slow the response time of off-chip capacitors 406, i<br>
is desirable to minimize the magnitudes of these inductances. For LSCs and DSCs, vertical loop inductance<br>
can be reduced by using capacitors with interdigital contacts. In addition, vertical loop inductance issues cai<br>
be addressed by placing off-chip capacitors 406 as electrically close as possible to the die load, such as by<br>
using ECCs that may be closer to the load than surface mounted capacitors. Similarly, lateral inductance<br>
issues can be addressed by placing adjacent capacitors, close to each other. For example, adjacent capacitors<br>
may be attached to adjacent pads on the package.<br>
Although these solutions are sufficient in certain cases, as the frequencies and edge rates of<br>
electronic devices continue to advance, there is an increasing need for higher levels of bypassing<br>
capacitance. In addition, there is a need for capacitance solutions that minimize the lateral inductance<br>
present between LSCs, DSCs, and ECCs. Accordingly, there is a need in the art for alternative capacitance<br>
solutions in the fabrication and design of electronic assemblies, such as integrated circuit packages.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Various embodiments of the present invention provide off-chip capacitance at reduced lateral<br>
inductance levels for bypassing, voltage dampening, and supplying charge. The various embodiments can<br>
be used to reduce the lateral inductance present between LSCs, DSCs, ECCs or other discrete capacitor<br>
configurations. In various embodiments, this is accomplished by using an existing feature inside discrete,<br>
multi-layer capacitors. This feature, which is the extremely low lateral inductance inside these capacitors, is<br>
exploited by electrically connecting the terminals of adjacent, discrete capacitors together, rather than<br>
relying on electrical connections formed from conductive structures within or on the surface of a package.<br>
These direct connections, referred to herein as "lateral connections," result in extremely low lateral<br>
inductances between LSCs, DSCs, and ECCs. Basically, the lateral connections of the various embodiments<br>
provide lateral current paths between the discrete capacitors. By utilizing lateral connections between the<br>
numerous conductive planes within the discrete capacitors, the various embodiments provide a high-<br>
frequency current redistribution network for the power delivery system. The effective redistribution of high-<br>
frequency current results in substantially reduced system noise and a more effective usage of bypassing<br>
capacitors. In addition, by reducing the system noise, the various embodiments can increase manufacturing<br>
yields and decrease the number of bypassing capacitors needed, thus reducing costs.<br>
Although the description of the various embodiments refers primarily to using discrete capacitors in<br>
conjunction with an integrated circuit package, the various embodiments also could be used in conjunction<br>
with other types of packages, ihterposers, printed circuit boards or other electronic circuit housings. In other<br>
words, the various embodiments could be used in conjunction with various types of electronic assemblies,<br>
and is not meant to be limited to use with integrated circuit packages. In addition, the various embodiments<br>
could be used with a number of different types of packages and packaging technologies. For example, the<br>
various embodiments could be used with organic or ceramic packages, and the packaging technologies with<br>
which the embodiments could be used include but are not limited to. land grid array (e.g., organic LGA), pin<br>
grid array (e.g., plastic PGA or flip chip PGA), ball grid array (e.g., _BGA, tape BGA, plastic BGA, flip<br>
chip BGA or flip chip tape BGA), tape automated bonding, wire bonding, and beam lead.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates a top or bottom view of a portion of an integrated circuit package 502 having<br>
multiple surface mounted capacitors 504 (e.g., LSCs or DSCs), which are electrically connected to pads 506<br>
on the surface of the package, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Capacitors 504<br>
could be, for example, ceramic chip capacitors, organic capacitors, integrated circuit capacitors or other<br><br>
types of discrete capacitors.<br>
Capacitors 504 include twelve terminals 508 distributed on all four sides. These terminals 508<br>
provide electrical connections to conductive planes of an internal capacitor structure (not shown) within<br>
capacitor 504. Going clockwise from the upper left terminal of each capacitor 504, the polarities of the<br>
terminals typically alternate between positive and negative, as indicated by the alternating cross-hatched<br>
patterns. In other words, the cross-hatching present on terminals 508 is intended to indicate that terminals<br>
508 are connected either to positive or negative interior planes within the capacitors 504, and also that the<br>
terminals 508 are connected, in an alternating manner, to power and ground planes (not shown) within the<br>
package 502.<br>
As will be exemplified below, capacitors 504 having more or fewer terminals distributed on more<br>
or fewer sides also could be used in conjunction with various embodiments. In addition, the polarities of the<br>
terminals need not strictly alternate between adjacent terminals. Although only four capacitors 504 are<br>
shown in the figure, more or fewer capacitors could be used as well. In some cases, thirty or more capacitors<br>
could be used to supply off-chip capacitance to a die.<br>
As the figure indicates, some of the terminals 510 of each capacitor 504 have direct, lateral<br>
connections 512 to some of the terminals 510 of adjacent capacitors. Each lateral connection 512 is between<br>
adjacent terminals 510 having the same polarity. Accordingly, a positive terminal 510 of a first discrete<br>
capacitor would be laterally connected to a positive terminal 510 of a second, adjacent discrete capacitor.<br>
This represents a significant distinction between the embodiments of the present invention and the prior art,<br>
where no such direct, lateral connections are present.<br>
Terminals of a capacitor 504 could be laterally connected to terminals of one, two or more adjacent<br>
capacitors. Accordingly, a capacitor 504 could be laterally connected to other capacitors on one, two or<br>
more sides. For example, terminals of each capacitor shown in Figure 5 are connected on two sides. In<br>
addition, although it is not shown in Figure 5, the terminals on a single side of a particular capacitor could be<br>
connected to the terminals on one or multiple adjacent capacitors.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates a cross-sectional vjew of a portion of the integrated circuit package 502 and<br>
surface mounted capacitors 504 of Figure 5 along section lines 6-6. When capacitors 504 are multi-layer<br>
capacitors, as shown, each capacitor 504 includes multiple interior planes 602,604 of conductive material,<br>
separated by layers of dielectric material; Although only six planes are shown, numerous planes are usually<br>
present (e.g., tens or hundreds of planes).<br>
Typically, conductive planes 602,604 are configured so that alternating planes connect to<br>
alternating terminals 606,608 substantially located on the sides of the capacitor. This enables terminals 606,<br>
608 and planes 602,604 to be connected, in an alternating manner, to pads 610,612 on the package body<br>
502, as described in conjunction with Figure 5. Pads 610,612, in turn, connect to either power or ground<br>
planes 614,616 within the package body 502 through plated or filled vias 618. For ease of description,<br>
Figures 6, 8 and 13 do not completely illustrate all of the various conducting and non-conducting layers that<br>
a package may have. Layers above and/or below planes 614,616 may also exist.<br>
In one embodiment, at least one terminal 608 of each capacitor 504 has a direct, lateral connection<br>
620 to a terminal 608 of an adjacent capacitor 504, where the lateral connection 620 is between adjacent<br>
terminals 608 having the same polarity. In one embodiment, the lateral connection 620 spans an elongated<br>
pad 610, which covers substantially aiJ of the distance between what would otherwise be two, adjacent<br>
standard sized pads (e.g., standard sized pads 612). This enables capacitors 504 to be placed on the package<br>
with the equivalent of a standard pad pitch of distance between them. Shorter or longer elongated pads<br>
could be used as well.<br>
In one embodiment, the lateral connection 620 is achieved using a conductive material 620 between<br>
the adjacent terminals 608. This conductive material 620 could be, in various embodiments, solder or a<br>
cured, conductive paste or adhesive, for example. The conductive material 620 could also be used to "<br>
connect the capacitors 504 to the package pads 610,612, or separate applications of conductive material<br>
could be used to achieve the capacitor-to-pad and capacitor-to-capacitor connections.<br>
Because the capacitors 504 are interconnected directly through lateral connections 620, and are not<br>
interconnected only through conductive structures within the package (e.g., combinations of pads, vias, and<br>
power or ground planes), the lateral inductance between the capacitors 504 is substantially reduced. In other<br>
words, the lateral current between capacitors 504 is carried substantially over the lateral connection 620,<br>
rather than over a conductive loop having a loop area that is bounded by various conductive structures of the<br>
package. Accordingly, the lateral connections have been shown to reduce the lateral inductance to fractions<br>
of picohenrys (e.g., 0.03 pH/square or less) from the tens of picohenrys that result from using prior art<br>
technologies. By utilizing lateral connections 620 between the conductive planes 602,604 within the<br>
discrete capacitors 504, a high-frequency current redistribution network for the power delivery system is<br>
provided.<br>
Figure 7 illustrates a top or bottom view of a portion of an integrated circuit package 702 having<br>
multiple surface mounted capacitors 704 (e.g., LSCs or DSCs), which are electrically connected to pads 706<br>
on the surface of the package, in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. Essentially,<br>
the embodiment illustrated in Figure 7 is similar to the embodiment illustrated in Figure 5, except that little<br>
or no physical distance exists between adjacent capacitors 704. In this embodiment, adjacent capacitors 704<br>
are in physical contact with each other or have a negligible distance between each other.<br>
Figure 8 illustrates a cross-sectional view of a portion of the integrated circuit package 702 and<br>
surface mounted capacitors 704 of Figure 7 along section lines 8-8. The embodiment illustrated in Figure 8<br>
is similar to the embodiment illustrated in Figure .6, except that little or no distance exists between adjacent<br>
terminals 802 of capacitors 704. Accordingly, the lateral connection between terminals 802 is accomplished<br>
by physical contact, in one embodiment. In the embodiment illustrated, both capacitors 704 can be<br>
connected to a standard sized pad 708 on the package 702.<br>
The lateral connection is further achieved, in one embodiment, using a conductive material 804<br>
between the adjacent terminals 802. This conductive material 804 could be, in various embodiments, solder<br>
or a cured, conductive paste or adhesive, for example. As with the embodiment illustrated in Figure 6, the<br>
conductive material 804 could also be used to connect the capacitors 704 to the package pads 708, or<br>
separate applications of conductive material could be used to achieve the capacitor-to-pad and capacitor-to-<br>
capacitor connections.<br>
Figure 9 illustrates a top or bottom view of a portion of an integrated circuit package 902 having<br>
multiple surface mounted capacitors 904 (e.g., LSCs or DSCs), which are electrically connected to pads 906<br>
on the surface of the package, in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. Capacitors<br>
904 include eight terminals 908 distributed on two sides. Lateral connections 910 are present between<br>
adjacent, same-polarity terminals of adjacent capacitors 904. Because capacitors 904 have terminals 908 on<br>
only two sides, however, these lateral connections 910 are present on only two sides. Figure 9 is intended to<br>
illustrate that lateral connections can be made between capacitors having various numbers of terminals on<br>
various numbers of sides. The embodiment shown in Figure 9 shows the capacitors 904 as being physically<br>
separated from each other. In other embodiments, capacitors 904 could be in physical contact with each<br>
other, or have a negligible distance between each other, as was illustrated in Figures 7 and 8.<br>
As another example, Figure 10 illustrates atop or bottom view of a portion of an integrated circuit<br>
package 1002 having multiple surface mounted capacitors 1004 (e.g., LSCs or DSCs), which are electrically<br>
connected to pads 1006 on the surface of the package, in accordance with another embodiment of the present<br>
invention. In this embodiment, capacitors 1004 are two-terminal, discrete capacitors. Commonly, although<br>
not necessarily, these types of capacitors include terminals 1008 that extend the entire length of the sides of<br>
the capacitor 1004. Because terminals 1008 are longer than many capacitors with more terminals, elongated<br>
lateral connections 1010 are present between same-polarity terminals of adjacent capacitors 1004. The<br>
elongated lateral connections 1010 are made to span enlarged pads (not shown) on the package surface, in<br>
one embodiment. These enlarged pads have a shape that facilitates the formation of lateral connections 1010<br>
out of a conductive material, such as solder or a cured, conductive paste or adhesive, for example. The<br>
embodiment shown in Figure 10 shows the capacitors 1004 as being physically separated from each other.<br>
In other embodiments, capacitors 1004 could be in physical contact with each other, or have a negligible<br>
distance between each other, as was illustrated in Figures 7 and 8.<br>
Figure 11 illustrates a top or bottom view of a portion of an integrated circuit package 1102 having<br>
multiple surface mounted capacitors 1104,1112,1114,1116 (e.g., LSCs or DSCs), which are electrically<br>
connected to pads 1106 on the surface of the package, in accordance with another embodiment of the present<br>
invention. The embodiment illustrated in Figure 11 is similar to the embodiment illustrated in Figure 10,<br>
except that adjacent terminals 1108 on adjacent capacitors not only have lateral connections 1110 in the<br>
vertical direction (e.g., between capacitors 1112 and 1114), but the terminals 1108 also have lateral<br>
connections 1110 in the horizontal direction (e.g., between capacitors 1114 and 1116). The enlarged lateral<br>
connections 1110 are made to span enlarged pads (not shown) on the package surface, in one embodiment.<br>
Figure 11 illustrates that, when a particular terminal contacts more than one side of the capacitor, lateral<br>
connections to the terminal can be made on more than one side of the capacitor, as shown. The embodiment<br>
shown in Figure 11 shows the capacitors 1104, 1112, 1114,1116 as being physically separated from each<br>
other. In other embodiments, capacitors 1104,1112,1114,1116 could be in physical contact with each<br>
other, or have a negligible distance between each other, as was illustrated in Figures 7 and 8.<br>
Figure 12 illustrates an interior, top or bottom view of an integrated circuit package 1202 having<br>
multiple embedded chip capacitors 1204 (ECCs), in accordance with one embodiment of the present<br>
invention. The embodiment illustrated in Figure 12 is similar to the embodiment illustrated in Figure 5,<br>
except that the ECCs are embedded within the package 1202, and the terminals 1206 of the ECCs 1204 are<br>
connected to conductive structures (e.g., traces and/or vias) within the package 1202, rather than to pads on<br>
the surface of the package. The lateral connections 1208 between terminals 1206 of adjacent ECCs 1204 are<br>
made in a similar manner to those discussed in conjunction with Figures 5 and 6.<br>
Figure 13 illustrates a cross-sectional view of a portion of the integrated circuit package 1202 and<br>
ECCs 1204 of Figure 12 along section lines 13-13. Similar to the surface mount capacitors described<br>
previously, when capacitors 1204 are multy fayer capacitor, as shown, each capacitor 1204 includes <br>
multiple interior planes 1302, 1304 of conductive material, separated by layers of dielectric material.<br>
Typically, conductive planes 1302,1304 are configured so that alternating planes connect to<br>
alternating terminals 1306,1308 around the capacitor. This enables terminals 1306,1308 and planes 1302,<br>
1304 to be connected, in an alternating manner, to conductive structures within the package body. These<br>
conductive structures can be vias 1310, such as illustrated in Figure 13, or they can be conductive traces or<br>
planes (not shown) within the package. The conductive structures, in turn, connect to either power or<br>
ground planes 1312,1314 within the package body. In the embodiment shown, vias 1310 make contact with<br>
terminals 1306, 1308 from the top of capacitors 1204. In other embodiments, one or more vias could make<br>
contact with terminals 1306,1308 from the bottom of capacitors 1204.<br>
Figure 13 does not completely illustrate the various conducting and non-conducting layers of<br>
package 1202, for ease of description. In an actual package design, one or more additional conducting<br>
and/or non-conducting layers could exist above, below, or in parallel with capacitors 1204. In order to<br>
minimize the loop inductance between capacitors 1204 and a die load, it may be desirable to embed<br>
capacitors 1204 as close to the top surface of the package 1202 as possible, although this is not essential.<br>
The capacitors could be embedded in one or multiple layers of a single package.<br>
In one embodiment, at least one terminal 1306 of each capacitor 1204 has a direct, lateral<br>
connection 1316 to a terminal 1306 of an adjacent capacitor 1204, where the lateral connection 1316 is<br>
between adjacent terminals 1306 having the same polarity. The lateral connection 1316 spans the distance<br>
between the adjacent terminals 1306. In various other embodiments, the adjacent terminals 1306 can be in<br>
physical contact (e.g., with little or no distance between them), or they can be separated by some non-<br>
negligible distance.<br>
In one embodiment, the lateral connection 1316 is achieved using a conductive material 1316<br>
between the adjacent terminals 1306. This conductive material_1316 could be, in various embodiments,<br>
solder or a cured, conductive paste or adhesive, for example. The conductive material 1316 could also be<br>
used to connect the capacitors 1304 to the package"s internal conductive structures, or separate applications<br>
of conductive material could be used to achieve the capacitor-to-package and capacitor-to-capacitor<br>
connections.<br>
In various embodiments, each capacitor 504, 704, 904,1004, 1104, and 1204, illustrated in Figures<br>
5-13 could be a ceramic capacitor, aluminum oxide capacitor, organic capacitor or a capacitor made with<br>
many other technologies, as would be obvious to one of skill in the art based on the description herein. In<br>
addition, the actual and relative dimensions of capacitors 504,704,904,1004,1104, and 1204 could vary<br>
widely, depending on design and manufacturing constraints or other factors. In addition, capacitors 504,<br>
704,904,1004,1104, and 1204 need not necessarily be rectangular in shape, as they could assume a number<br>
of different shapes (e.g., square or multi-sided).<br>
Figure 14 illustrates a flowchart of a method for manufacturing an electronic assembly having<br>
laterally connected capacitors in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The method<br>
begins, in block 1402, by fabricating one or more layers of an electronic housing. The electronic housing<br>
could be, for example, an integrated circuit package, other type of package, interposer, printed circuit (PC)<br>
board, or other type of electronics cirouit package. The details regarding fabricating the housing layer(s)<br>
depend entirely on the type of packaging technology used, and a discussion of the various packaging<br>
technology fabrication methods are outside of the scope of this invention. Fabrication of the electronic<br>
housing layers results in a rigid structure with conductive pads on its surface and/or other exterior or interior<br>
conductive structures.<br>
In block 1404, two or more discrete capacitors are laterally attached to the electronic housing.<br>
Where the discrete capacitors are LSCs or DSCs, lateral attachment involves attaching the capacitors to pads<br>
on the surface of the electronic housing, so that one or more terminals of one or more adjacent capacitors are<br>
attached together with a lateral connection (e.g., connection 620, Figure 6). Attachment of the capacitors to<br>
the housing and to each other can be done in separate processes, or can be done simultaneously. For<br>
example, the discrete capacitors can first be surface mounted to the housing pads, and then the adjacent<br>
capacitors" terminals can be laterally attached in a separate process. Alternatively, the surface mounting and<br>
lateral attachment can be performed simultaneously, for example, by soldering the pads and adjacent<br>
terminals together at the same time. Alternatively, a cured, conductive paste or adhesive could be used to<br>
provide the capacitor-to-pad and/or lateral connections.<br>
Where the discrete capacitors are ECCs, the capacitors would be placed on the top layer of the<br>
partial housing or within depressions within the housing. The ECCs would then be laterally attached to each<br>
other and/or to conductive structures within the housing using one or several processes.<br>
After laterally attaching the discrete capacitors, the housing fabrication is completed, if necessary,<br>
in block 1406. In the case of ECCs, this may include building up one or more additional layers of patterned<br>
conductive and dielectric materials over the ECCs, including the formation of vias and/or other conductive<br>
structures. The process then ends.<br>
As described previously, laterally connected capacitors, such as those described in the various<br>
embodiments above, can be included on or within an integrated circuit package, interposer, socket, PC <br>
board, and/or other types of electronic circuit housing. Figure 15 illustrates an integrated circuit package<br>
1504, interposer 1506, socket 1508, and PC board 1510 each of which could include two or more laterally<br>
connected capacitors in accordance with various embodiments of the present invention.<br>
Starting from the top of Figure 15, an integrated circuit 1502 is housed by integrated circuit<br>
package 1504. Integrated circuit 1502 contains one or more circuits, which are electrically connected to<br>
integrated circuit package 1504 by connectors (not shown).<br>
Integrated circuit 1502 could be any of a number of types of integrated circuits. In one embodiment<br>
of the present invention, integrated circuit 1502 is a microprocessor. In other embodiments., integrated<br>
circuit 1502 could be a memory device, application specific integrated circuit, digital signal processor, or<br>
another type of divice. In the example shown, integrated circuit 1502 is a "flips chip" type of integrated<br>
circuit, meaning that the input/output terminations on the chip can occur at any point on its surface. After<br>
the chip has been readied for attachment to integrated circuit package 1504, it is flipped over and attached,<br>
via solder bumps or balls to matching pads on the top surface of integrated circuit package 1504.<br>
Alternatively, integrated circuit 1502 could be wire bonded, where input/output terminations are connected<br>
to integrated circuit package 1504 using bond wires to pads on the top surface of integrated circuit package<br>
1504, or otherwise connected to package 1504.<br>
One or more of the circuits within integrated circuit 1502 acts as a load, which may require<br>
bypassing capacitance for noise or radiation suppression, and/or voltage dampening. Some of this<br>
capacitance is provided, in one embodiment of the present invention, by laterally connected DSCs 1512,<br>
LSCs 1514, and/or ECCs 1516, which are surface mounted on and/or embedded within package 1504. In<br>
this manner, one or more levels of additional capacitance are provided to integrated circuit 1502. In other<br>
embodiments, laterally connected capacitors 1518 are surface mounted on and/or embedded within<br>
interposer 1506, socket 1508, and/or PC board 1510.<br>
Integrated circuit package 1504 is coupled to interposer 1506 using solder connections, such as ball<br>
grid array connections, for example. In another embodiment, integrated circuit package 1504 could be<br>
electrically and physically connected to interposer 1506 using a pinned or other type of connection.<br>
Interposer 1506 is coupled to PC board 1510 through a socket 1508 on PC board 1510. In the<br>
example shown, interposer 1506 includes pins, which mate with complementary pin holes in socket 1508.<br>
Alternatively, interposer 1506 could be electrically and physically connected to PC board 1510 using solder<br>
connections, such as ball grid array connections, for example. In still another alternate embodiment,<br>
integrated circuit package 1504 could be connected directly to socket 1508 and/or PC board 1510, without<br>
using an interposer. In such an embodiment, integrated circuit package 1504 and PC board 1510 couJd be<br>
electrically and physically connected using ball grid array or pinned connections. Other ways of connecting<br>
integrated circuit package 1504 and PC board 1510 could also be used in other embodiments.<br>
PC board 1510 could be, for example, a motherboard of a computer or other electronic system. As<br>
such, it acts as a vehicle to supply power, ground, and signals to integrated circuit 1502. These power,<br>
ground, and other signals are supplied through traces or planes (not shown) on or within PC board 1510,<br>
socket 1508, interposer 1506, and integrated circuit package 1504.<br>
The configurations described above in conjunction with various embodiments could form part of an<br>
electronic system. Figure 16 illustrates an electronic system in accordance with one embodiment of the<br>
present invention. The system shown in Figure 16 could be, for example, a computer, a wireless or wired<br>
communication device (e.g., telephone, modem, cell phone, pager, radio, etc.), a television, a monitor, or<br>
virtually any other type of electronic system that could benefit from the use of laterally connected capacitors.<br>
The electronic system includes circuit 1602, housing 1604, PC board 1606, and power supply 1608.<br>
Housing 1604 and/or PC board 1606 include two or more laterally connected capacitors surface mounted on<br>
or embedded within them, in accordance with various embodiments of the present invention.<br>
Conclusion<br>
Various embodiments of an electronic assembly with laterally connected capacitors and methods of<br>
fabricating that assembly have been described, along with a description of the incorporation of the assembly<br>
within an electronic system. The various embodiments can be used to reduce the lateral inductance present<br>
between LSCs, DSCs, ECCs or other discrete capacitor configurations. In various embodiments, the<br>
extremely low lateral inductance inside multi-layer capacitors is exploited by electrically connecting the<br>
terminals of adjacent, discrete capacitors together, rather than relying on electrical connections formed from<br>
conductive structures within or on the surface of the package. These lateral connections result in extremely<br>
low lateral inductances between LSCs, DSCs, and ECCs. By utilizing lateral connections between the<br>
numerous conductive planes within the discrete capacitors, the various embodiments provide a high-<br>
frequency current redistribution network for the power delivery system.<br>
While the foregoing examples of dimensions and ranges are considered typical, the various<br>
embodiments of the invention are not limited to such dimensions or ranges. It is recognized that the trend<br>
within industry is to generally reduce device dimensions for the associated cost and performance benefits.<br>
In the foregoing detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form<br>
a part hereof, and in which are shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the invention<br>
may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to<br>
practice the invention.<br>
It will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that any arrangement, which is calculated<br>
to achieve the same purpose, may be substituted for the specific embodiment shown. For example, although<br>
some of the figures show four discrete capacitors arranged in a square pattern, more or fewer capacitors<br>
could be used, and they could be arranged in other pattern configurations, including linear, ring or irregularly<br>
shaped configurations.<br>
The various embodiments have been described in the context of providing excess, off-chip<br>
capacitance to a die. One of ordinary skill in the art would understand, based on the description herein, that<br>
the method and apparatus of the present invention could also be applied in many other applications where a<br>
capacitor configuration having a low lateral inductance is desired. Therefore, all such applications are<br>
intended to fall within the spirit and scope of the present invention.<br>
This application is intended to cover any adaptations or variations of the present invention. The<br>
foregoing detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and it will be readily<br>
understood by those skilled in the art that various other changes in the details, materials, and arrangements of<br>
