Summary<br>
[5]       In certain exemplary embodiments, a replaceable memory cartridge can be used with a programmable logic controller. The memory cartridge can be adapted to store a data log. The data log can be initialized by writing a head marker code in the record type field of a first record and an invalid code in the record type field of a last record of the data log. The last record can be logically adjacent to the first record regardless of physical location. Fields of data log records can be filled with data sequentially. For example, responsive ' to collecting data to fill the first record, a head marker code can be written to the record type field of a second record, thereby automatically invalidating the second record. Data can be written to at least one field of the first record. The record type field of the first record can be overwritten with a code indicative of valid data.<br>

The head marker can be indicative of a record that will receive the data of a next record to be written to file 2100. The head marker can be indicative of a starting point for uploading data from file 2100 to an information device. In certain exemplary embodiments, record 2300 can be logically adjacent to record 2200 even if record 2200 and record 2300 are not physically adjacent.<br>
[120]   FIG. 3 is a sequence of states of a plurality of records 3000. Plurality of<br>
records 3000 can comprise records in state 3100 at a first point in time. At a later second time, records 3000 can comprise records in state 3200. At a still later third time, records 3000 can comprise records in state 3300. Progressing from state 3100 to state 3200 to state 3300 can be indicative of a process for writing data to at least one field of Record 2. At state 3100, plurality of records 3000 can comprise Record 1, which comprises a record type code indicative that Record 1 comprises valid data. At state 3100, Record 2 comprises a record type code indicative of a head marker - thereby indicating that Record 2 comprises invalid data. At state 3100, Record 3 and records between Record 3 and Record "x-1" can comprise an undefined record type. The undefined record type can be used to initialize the plurality of records. The undefined record type can automatically indicate that Record 3 and records between Record 3 and Record "x-1" do not comprise valid data. At state 3100, Record x can comprise an invalid record type code. Record x can be considered to be logically adjacent to Record 1 in a logically circular data log. If an invalid code is found in the record type field in Record x, records logically between Record x and the first record comprising a head marker code in the record type field - Record 2 in this embodiment - are valid.<br>
[121]   Records 3000 can comprise records in state 3200 at a second point in time. At state 3200, Record 1 can comprise a record type code indicative of the record comprising valid data. At state 3200, Record 2 can comprise a record type code indicative of a head marker - thereby indicating that record 2 comprises<br><br>
invalid data. At state 3200 Record 3, can comprise a record type code indicative of a head marker - thereby indicating that record 3 comprises invalid data. Placing a record type code of head marker in record 3 can be a step to allow record 2 to be overwritten with valid data while providing that at least one record of the plurality of records in this embodiment comprises a head marker code in the record type field. Should power fail with the plurality of records in state 3200, a scan of the records would reveal two head marker codes. The head marker code in record 2 can be considered the valid head marker. The head marker code in record 3 can either be ignored or overwritten with a record type code of invalid. In this way, one record of data might be lost in event of a power failure without affecting valid records, such as Record 1, stored in records 3000. At state 3200, a plurality of records between Record 3 and Record "x-1 can comprise an undefined record type. The undefined record type can be used to initialize the plurality of records. The undefined record type can automatically indicate that records between Record 3 and Record "x-1" do not comprise valid data. At state 3200, Record x can comprise an invalid record type code.<br>
[122]   Records 3000 can comprise records in state 3300 at a third point in time. At state 3300, Record 1 can comprise a record type code indicative of the record comprising valid data. At state 3300, Record 2 can comprise a record type code indicative of valid - thereby indicating that valid data has been written to Record 2 during the time interval between state 3200 and state 3300. At state 3300, Record 3 can comprise a record type code indicative of a head marker -thereby indicating that Record 3 comprises invalid data. At state 3300, a plurality of records following Record 3 and continuing through Record "x-1 can comprise an undefined record type. The undefined record type can be used to initialize the plurality of records. The undefined record type can automatically indicate that records between Record 3 and Record "xrl" do not comprise valid data. At state 3200, Record x can comprise an invalid record type code.<br>
[123]   Overwriting the record type of head marker in Record 2 between state 3200 and state 3300 can provide a degree of fault tolerance to records 3000. If<br><br>
power is lost to the programmable logic controller between state 3200 and state 3300 before the head marker record type code in Record 2 is overwritten, only the data that would have been written to Record 2 will be lost. Remaining records comprising valid data, such as Record 1 can still be read from records 3000.<br>
[124]   A sequence of states such as state 3100, state 3200, and state 3300 can be<br>
iteratively continued until and/or beyond a state wherein all records comprise data except for a record with a record type code of a head marker. If continued beyond the state wherein all records comprise data except for a record with a record type code of a head marker, the plurality of records can be circular in the sense that newest records can progressively overwrite oldest record in the plurality of records - thereby successively advancing the record that comprises a head marker code in the record type field.<br>
[125]   FIG. 4 is a sequence of states of plurality of records 4000. Plurality of records 4000 can be described by a series of non-sequential states such as state 4100, state 4200, state 4300, state 4400, and state 4500. In certain exemplary embodiments, a set of pointers can be used. Using pointers can improve access and write times related to plurality of records 4000. Pointers can provide a programmable logic controller with relatively efficient access to an absolute or relative location of plurality of records 4000 in a particular memory device associated with a programmable logic controller. Pointers can comprise a beginning pointer, ending pointer, head pointer, and/or tail pointer, etc.<br>
[126]   The beginning pointer can indicate a location of a first physical and/or logical record of plurality of records 4000. Once defined, the beginning pointer can remain set so long as plurality of records 4000 remains defined without change in the particular memory device. The end pointer can indicate a location of a last physical and/or logical record of plurality of records 4000. Once defined, the ending pointer can remain set so long as plurality of records 4000 remains defined without change in the particular memory device.<br><br>
[127]   The head pointer of plurality of records 4000 can be used to point to a record comprising a code indicative of a head marker record type. The record pointed to by the head pointer can be a next location wherein data from sensors and/or instruments associated with a process can be stored. The head pointer and/or head marker can be advanced by one logical position, in pointing to a record of plurality of records 4000, each time data is written to fill a next record.<br>
[128]   The tail pointer of plurality of records 4000 can be used to point to a record that is temporally oldest among plurality of records 4000. Alternatively when plurality of records 4000 is first defined, the tail pointer can indicate a<br>
logically first record of plurality of records 4000. The tail pointer can be<br>
i<br>
advanced by one logical position, in pointing to a record of plurality of records 4000, each time data is written to fill a next record once all records comprise data. Certain exemplary embodiments do not move the tail pointer until all records comprise valid data and the programmable logic controller begins to overwrite previous records,.<br>
[129]   At state 4100, plurality of records 4000 can be initially defined and as<br>
illustrated does not comprise process data in any of plurality of records 4000. The beginning pointer, the head pointer, and the tail pointer, if pointers are used, can each be defined to point to a first record of a logically contiguous plurality of records 4000. A record type code of "02" can be stored in the first record, which can be indicative of a head marker in the first record. The end pointer, if used, can be indicative of a last logical record in plurality of records 4000. A record type code of "00" can be stored in the last record, which can be indicative of an invalid record being present in the last logical record. In certain exemplary embodiments a number of valid records of plurality of records 4000 can be determined by a logical number of records between the record comprising the head marker code in the record type field and a nearest logically preceding record comprising an invalid code in the record type field. At state 4100, if the invalid code is in a cell logically immediately preceding the record comprising the head marker code in the record type field, plurality of records 4000 might not comprise any valid records.<br><br>
[130]   At state 4200, plurality of records 4000 can be fully populated with process data. At state 4200 the beginning pointer, if used, can continue to indicate a physically and/or logically first record of plurality of records 4000. The ending pointer, if used, can continue to indicate a physically and/or logically last record of plurality of records 4000. The head pointer, if used, can point at a next location - indicated as the third of the list of six records illustrated in this particular embodiment - wherein process data can be written. The record pointed to by the head pointer comprises a code of "02," which can be indicative of a head marker in the record type field of the record, thereby automatically invalidating the record comprising the head maker code. Since plurality of records 4000 comprises no invalid codes in the record type fields, plurality of records 4000 can be considered as fully populated with data with the exception of the automatically invalid record comprising the head marker code. The tail pointer, if used, can mark a location - indicated as the fourth of the list of six records illustrated in this particular embodiment - wherein an oldest present record is written. In the particular embodiment illustrated in state 4200, all records except for the record associated with the head marker can comprise a code of "01" in the respective record type field, which can be indicative of a valid record.<br>
[131]   As state 4300, plurality of records 4000 can be fully populated with process data. At state 4300 the beginning pointer, if used, can continue to indicate a physically and/or logically first record of plurality of records 4000. The ending pointer, if used, can continue to indicate a physically and/or logically last record of plurality of records 4000. The head pointer can point at a next location (indicated as the sixth of the list of six records illustrated in this particular embodiment) wherein process data can be written. The record pointed to by the head pointer comprises a code of "02," which can be indicative of a head marker in the record type field of the record. The tail marker can mark a location (indicated as the first of the list of six records illustrated in this particular embodiment) wherein an oldest present record is written. In the particular embodiment illustrated in state 4300, all records except for the record associated with the head marker can comprise a code of<br><br>
"01" in the respective record type field, which can be indicative of valid records. In a circular data log, when a request is received to write a next record to the data log, the head marker code can be written to the first logical record of plurality of records 4000, thereby invalidating the first logical record.<br>
[132]   At state 4400, plurality of records 4000 can comprise one or more invalid<br>
records. An invalid record can be determined by locating a value of "00" in a record type field of plurality of records 4000 (such as the value illustrated in the second cell of the plurality of records in the illustrated embodiment). The invalid record code can provide a user with information indicative that a particular record is invalid. For example, data denoted by the record type as invalid can be excluded from statistical and/or graphical analyses of plurality of records 4000.<br>
[133]   At state 4400, plurality of records 4000 can be in a state following an<br>
uploading of plurality of records 4000 with instructions to erase plurality of records 4000 after uploading. In certain exemplary embodiments, state 4400 can occur as a result of a power failure. In certain exemplary embodiments, state 4400 can occur as a result of a memory cartridge of an unknown state being placed in a programmable logic controller. An initial search can be made of the record type field to locate the record comprising a head marker code in the record type field - in this case in the fourth record from the logical beginning of plurality of records 4000. The head pointer, if used, can be assigned to point to this record. A search of the record type fields at state 4400 reveals two invalid record codes. The closest invalid record code preceding the record comprising the head marker code can indicate that no valid records are available and that the data log is effectively empty. Responsive to locating the invalid record code in the third record from the logical beginning of plurality of records 4000, the tail pointer, if used, can be set to point to the same record as pointed to by the head pointer. In certain exemplary embodiments, if a data log is to be erased after an uploading operation has been completed, an invalid record code can be placed in a record immediately preceding the record comprising the head marker. The tail<br><br>
pointer, if used, can then be set to point to the record comprising the head marker.<br>
[134]   At state 4500, plurality of records 4000 can comprise a single invalid code in the second record from the logical beginning of prurality of records 4000. After adding a valid record to the third cell, the tail pointer, if used, can be assigned to point to the valid record as the oldest valid record in plurality of records 4000. The head marker code can be found, in this particular embodiment, in the record type field of the fourth record.<br>
[135]   At state 4600, plurality of records 4000 can be partially filled. The particular embodiment illustrated indicates four valid records, one invalid record, and a head marker in the record type fields of plurality of records 4000. The tail pointer, if used, can be pointed at an oldest record, which happens to be in a logical location immediately following a record comprising a record type code of invalid. A next group of process data to be recorded to a record can be placed in the cell indicated by the head pointer, if used, once the head pointer and head marker have been incremented. Since the head pointer and the tail pointer, if used, do not point to consecutively numbered records, data can be added to a next record without incrementing the tail pointer.<br>
[136]   FIG. 5 is a flowchart of an exemplary embodiment of a method 5000 for using the memory device. In certain exemplary embodiments, at activity 5100, a request and/or definition can be received at a programmable logic controller for creating a data log file. The request can be from a user of the programmable logic controller. The request can be initiated by a user of the programmable logic controller. The user can request data collection from a plant and/or process utilizing the programmable logic controller. Responsive to the user request, a memory device, such as a memory cartridge, can be initialized to obtain and/or collect data requested by the user. The amount of collected data can be user-specified in any of numerous fashions, such as an amount of time over which to collect data, an amount of memory to fill, a number of data records to collect, etc. In certain exemplary embodiments a data log definition can be received at a programmable logic controller to create<br><br>
a data log file. The data log definition can be generated responsive to the user request and/or can be automatically generated by the programmable logic controller.<br>
[137]   At activity 5200, a block of memory of a memory device can be allocated for the data log. The block of memory can be allocated responsive to a user request and/or automatically. Memory can be allocated to comprise a predetermined plurality of records. The memory device can be organized to hold the predetermined plurality of records. Each record can comprise a record type field, which is a field that indicates whether the record is a valid record, an invalid record, and/or a "head" record (indicated by a "head marker" code in the record type field). In certain exemplary embodiments, records can comprise a date stamp, time stamp, identifier, process unit identifier, machine stamp, sensor number, and actuator number, and/or data field, etc. The block of memory can be allocated to comprise one record more than desired for data storage in order to accommodate an automatically invalid record comprising a code indicative of a head maker record type. Searching the block of memory can identify an invalid record and/or a valid record.<br>
[138]   In an exemplary embodiment, the data log file can be written in a logically<br>
circular buffer; The logically circular buffer can be characterized by data log records written to contiguous memory segments, the buffer commencing at a beginning memory segment. The logically circular buffer can be further characterized by the writing of the next data log record at the beginning of the buffer when the buffer is full The next data log record can overwrite an oldest data log record written in the logically circular buffer. For example, if the buffer is full, the next data log record to be written can be written at the beginning of the buffer, thereby overwriting the data log record that was previously at the beginning of the buffer. The logically circular buffer can comprise a circular buffer wherein memory segments are physically contiguous to each other.<br>
[139]   At activity 5300, a the plurality of records can be initialized. For example, the first record can be initialized by placing a code indicative of a head marker in<br><br>
the record type field - thereby automatically invalidating the first record. A last record of the plurality of records can be initialized by placing a code indicative of an invalid record in the record type field- The predetermined plurality of records can be logically circular in that the last record can be logically adjacent to the first record.<br>
[140]   If pointers or used, activity 5300 can comprise defining pointers. Pointers associated with the plurality of records can comprise a beginning pointer, ending pointer, head pointer, and/or tail pointer, etc. Pointers can be used to quickly and efficiently direct an information device to a record to be written to and/or uploaded from. Upon an initial creation of the plurality of records, the beginning record pointer, the head pointer, and/or the tail pointer can be associated with a first record in a logical sequence of the plurality of records. The ending record pointer can be initially associated with a last record in the logical sequence of the plurality of records.<br>
[141]   At activity 5400, an instruction and/or directive can be executed to add plant and/or process data to the plurality of records. The instruction and/or directive can be a part of a plurality of machine readable instructions resident on a programmable logic controller. The instruction can comprise obtaining and or formatting data to fill at least one of the plurality of records. Responsive to an instruction to add data to the first record, the code indicative of the head marker can be written to the record type field of a second record logically incremented from the first record.<br>
[142]   Data can be acquired from the plant and/or process to fill at least one field of the first record. Once filled with data the first record can be considered as a most recently filled record. The first record can be the first record read in an uploading event, should such an event occur before new data is added to another of the plurality of records. If pointers are used, pointers can be incremented responsive to data added to the first record. The head pointer can be incremented to be associated with the second record. If the head pointer and the tail pointer are equal after the head pointer has been advanced to point<br><br>
to the second record, then the tail pointer can be changed to point at a third record that can be the next record logically after the second record.<br>
[143]   To verify that a proper writing of data has occurred, the record types of the<br>
first and/or second record can be read back by the programmable logic<br>
controller. Verifying that the first record comprises a non-head marker record<br>
type and that the second record comprises a head marker record type can<br>
verify that a write operation adding data to the plurality of records has been<br>
successfully completed. In certain exemplary embodiments, the<br>
programmable logic controller can read a plurality of record type fields from<br>
the plurality of records to assure the presence of a single head marker after the<br>
power failure via an error checking technique. The error checking technique<br>
can be an ones complement method, a Fletcher checksum method, a cyclic<br>
redundancy check method, and/or extended-precision checksum method, etc.<br>
The error checking technique, possibly coupled with knowledge of the<br>
position of the records in question and/or the position and/or direction that<br>
records are added to the memory device, can identify which record is the most<br>
■	recent, and thereby which head marker is erroneous if more than one head<br>
marker is detected.<br>
[144]   In an operative embodiment, the PLC can disable and/or eliminate the older, duplicate head marker, or possibly convert the older, duplicate head marker to a non-head marker resulting in the presence of a single head marker in the data log file, that single head marker corresponding to a record which will receive the next data from the plant and/or process. Changing the value of a binary bit can disable the older, duplicate head marker. Alternatively, the PLC can inspect and test a marker, such as a time stamp marker, on each of the data log records, to determine the most recently written record. In certain operative embodiments a time to write a record to a data log can be measured as being between two and three cache writing cycles to a serial eeprom memory device. The time to write the record can be less than 40 ms.<br>
[145]   At activity 5500, instructions can be executed to upload records from the<br>
plurality of records. The instructions can be from a user and/or automatically<br><br>
generated by the programmable logic controller. The instructions can be based upon a scheduled time, scheduled amount of data collected, and/or a specific user request, etc. The instructions can comprise a setting corresponding to an instruction to erase or to not erase the data log from the memory device after the data log is uploaded. The instruction to erase or not erase the data log file subsequent to reading the data log file can allow a user to more effectively manage data storage and retrieval on the memory device. Erasing the data log file can provide an assurance that no data log record on the memory device has been previously read. Data log records can be uploaded beginning with a record logically preceding the record pointed to by the head pointer and comprising the code indicative of the head marker data type. Uploading data can continue on a record by record basis beginning with a newest record until the oldest record is reached, which will be associated with the tail pointer if pointers are used. The tail pointer, if used, can point to an oldest record in the plurality of records once data has been provided to at least one record of the plurality of records.<br>
[146]   In certain operative embodiments, a new record addition can be requested during activity 5500. Responsive to the new record addition, a record type code of invalid can be assigned to an uploaded record that comprises data associated with the new record addition request. The new record can be added by writing a head marker code to a record type field of a second record of the plurality of records responsive to the request to add the new record. Data can be written to at least one field of the first record of the plurality of records. A valid code can be written to the record type field of the first record. The new record can be uploaded as a valid record during a subsequent execution of activity 5500.<br>
[147]   Activity 5500 can comprise, responsive to instructions to remove uploaded<br>
records from the plurality of records, record type fields and/or pointers can be reset. In certain exemplary embodiments, the record immediately preceding the head marker code can be assigned an invalid code as a record type. The tail pointer, if used, can then be set equal to the head pointer, if used, and hence to point to a record logically incremented by one from the closest<br><br>
preceding record comprising and invalid code. Thus, previously stored records from the plurality of records can be effectively erased by only changing a small number, such as one or two, record type fields in the plurality of records.<br>
[148]   FIG. 6 is a flowchart of an exemplary embodiment of a method 6000. At activity 6100, a programmable logic controller can detect a memory device. The programmable logic controller can determine that the organization of the memory device is unknown to the programmable controller. The programmable logic controller can detect the memory device after returning to operation after a power failure. In certain exemplary embodiments, the memory device can be a memory cartridge newly placed and/or replaced in the programmable logic controller by a user. A replaceable memory cartridge can be used to transfer programs and/or recipes between programmable logic controllers. Data cartridges can be changed without losing data comprised and/or stored on the memory cartridge. Data cartridges can be changed to upload data from the data log to a customer information device. Changing a data cartridge to upload data can allow a customer to transfer data from the data log without having the programmable logic controller connected to a same network as the customer information device.<br>
[149]   At activity 6200, a data log can be located on the memory device. The data log can comprise a plurality of records. Each record can comprise a record type field. A code can be placed in the record type field indicative of a head marker, invalid data, undefined data, and/or valid data, etc.<br>
r<br>
[150]   At activity 6300, the data log can be searched for records comprising a head marker code in the record type field. If no record comprises a head marker code, a default record such as a first logical record can be assigned the head marker code. In certain exemplary embodiments if a plurality of records comprise head marker codes, all head marker codes can be changed to invalid codes except a logically first record comprising the head marker code. In certain exemplary embodiments, the logically first record comprising the head marker code can be pointed to as the next record to receive plant and/or<br><br>
process data. The logically first record can be automatically invalidated. In certain exemplary embodiments, the logically first record can be adapted to receive plant and/or process data without changing record type fields of other records comprising head marker codes. In certain exemplary embodiments, a head pointer can be defined that improves access to the logically first record by the programmable logic controller. Activity 6300 can assure that plant and/or process data is stored at a proper location in the data log.<br>
[151]   At activity 6400, the data log can be searched for a record comprising an<br>
invalid code. The search can comprise scanning the record type field of each record. A record that comprises an invalid code can be found as a result of searching the records. If more than one record comprises the invalid code, a closest record logically preceding the record comprising the head marker can be found. If any records exist between the record comprising the invalid code and the record comprising the head marker, those records can be considered to comprise valid data. If an invalid code is found and the data log comprises valid data, an oldest record can be a record logically following the closest record found in activity 6300. In certain exemplary embodiments a tail pointer, if used, can be defined to point to the oldest valid record.<br>
[152]   If no records comprise an invalid code for a record type, all records except the record comprising the head marker can be considered to comprise valid data. The oldest record can be a record immediately following the record comprising the head marker. If pointers are used, the tail pointer can be defined to point to the record immediately following the record comprising the head marker.<br>
[153]   FIG. 7 is a block diagram of an exemplary embodiment of an information device 7000, which in certain operative embodiments can comprise, for example, information device 1700 of FIG-1. Information device 7000 can comprise any of numerous well-known components, such as for example, one or more network interfaces 7100, one or more processors 7200, one or more memories 7300 containing instructions 7400, one or more input/output (I/O)<br><br>
devices 7500, and/or one or more user interfaces 7600 coupled to I/O device 7500, etc.<br>
[154]   In certain exemplary embodiments, via one or more user interfaces 7600, such as a graphical user interface, a user can view a rendering of information related to defining, storing, and/or uploading data from a data log.<br>
