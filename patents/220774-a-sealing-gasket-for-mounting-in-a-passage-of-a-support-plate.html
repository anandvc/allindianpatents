				<td>The present invention relates to a sealing gasket for mounting in a passage of a support plate.<br>
The present invention relates to the technical field<br>
of molecular or particulate separation using filter or<br>
separation elements generally referred to as membranes,<br>
adapted to separate molecules or particles contained in a<br>
fluid medium for processing.<br>
The present invention relates more particularly to<br>
technical means adapted to provide sealing for such<br>
filter or separation elements.<br>
The subject matter of the invention finds a<br>
particularly advantageous application in the field of<br>
filtering, in the broad sense, a fluid medium for<br>
processing, and in particular nanofiltering,<br>
ultrafiltering, microfiltering, etc.<br>
In the state of the art, it is known to use a filter<br>
module constituted by a metal case fitted at each end<br>
with a support plate arranged to present one or more<br>
packages for allowing filter elements of tubular shape to<br>
be positioned relative to one another. The filter<br>
elements thus extend inside the case parallel to one<br>
another arid they are mounted in leaktight manner at each<br>
end to a support plate.<br>
Each filter element has at least one flow channel<br>
for the fluid to be processed, the channel extending from<br>
one terminal portion to the other terminal portion of the<br>
element. Filter elements perform cross-flow filtering of<br>
the fluid in order to obtain, at the peripheral surface<br>
of the filter elements, an outlet filtrate that is<br>
designed to be recovered in a collection volume situated<br>
between the support plates and the case.<br>
In order to ensure sealing between the terminal<br>
portions of the filter elements and the support plates,<br>
sealing gaskets are positioned and clamped by means of a<br>
metal backplate fixed on each support plate. The sealing<br>
gaskets are made of deformable material such as an<br>
elastomer or a rubber so that on being tightened they<br>
provide sealing between the support plates and the filter<br>
elements.<br>
Unfortunately, it sometimes happens that filter<br>
elements are broken at their terminal portions positioned<br>
in the support plates. The Applicant has found that the<br>
main cause, of filter elements breaking at the support<br>
plates comes from friction between the filter element and<br>
the support plate and/or the clamping back plate.<br>
On the basis of that observation, the Applicant has<br>
developed a novel sealing gasket for a filter element<br>
that is designed to avoid the elements becoming eroded by<br>
contact with the support plates and/or the clamping<br>
backplates, without disturbing fluid flow.<br>
The object of the invention is thus to propose a<br>
sealing gasket for mounting in a passage of a support<br>
plate to surround the end of a filter element of tubular<br>
shape that is provided with at least one flow channel for<br>
a fluid, said channel lying within a flow section.<br>
According to the invention, the sealing gasket is<br>
made in the form of a sleeve:<br>
- possessing a height not less than the height of<br>
the passage in the support plate; and<br>
- presenting an overlap bore for the filter element<br>
defined between one end of the sleeve and a shoulder<br>
which co-operates with the other end of the sleeve to<br>
define a channel bore for the fluid, the shoulder<br>
possessing a surface for acting as an abutment for the<br>
terminal portion of the filter element and presenting<br>
dimensions that are adapted to extend outside the flow<br>
section so as to avoid impeding fluid circulation, the<br>
overlap bore being provided with a groove adjacent to the<br>
shoulder in order to allow the gasket to creep.<br>
The sealing gasket of the invention makes it<br>
possible to avoid any contact between the filter elements<br>
and the metal portions constituted by the clamping<br>
backplates and by the support plates. By implementing an<br>
abutment for the filter elements, the filter elements are<br>
prevented from moving under the effect of the pressure<br>
difference that arises between their upstream and<br>
downstream terminal portions, such that a filter element<br>
can no longer move, and consequently can no longer come<br>
into contact with the metal backplate.<br>
Various other characteristics appear from the<br>
description given below with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings which, as non-limiting examples,<br>
show embodiments and implementations of the invention.<br>

invention.<br>

looking substantially along liens IV-IV of Figure 3 and.<br>
showing a characteristic detail of the invention.<br>
Figure 5 is a view on a larger scale showing various<br>
characteristics of an embodiment of a sealing gasket of<br>
the invent Lori.<br>
Figure 6 shows a multiple sealing gasket in<br>
accordance with the invention.<br>
As can be seen more clearly in Figures 1 and 2, the<br>
subject matter of the invention is implemented for a<br>
device or module 1 performing cross-flow filtering for a<br>
fluid to be treated that can be of any kind. In a case<br>
or cylinder 2, the module 1 comprises one, and more<br>
generally a series of tubular-shaped filter elements 3<br>
extending parallel to one another and represented in<br>
Figure 1 solely by their axes. As can be seen more<br>
clearly from Figures 3 and 4, each filter element 3<br>
possesses a right cross-section of outside shape that is<br>
hexagonal, for example, or circular as in the example<br>
shown. Each filter element 3 comprises at least one, and<br>
in the example shown, three channels 3: extending parallel<br>
to the longitudinal axis of the filter element 3 so as to<br>
open out in each of its terminal portions 3a and 3b. The<br>
surface of each channel 3l is covered in at least one<br>
separating layer (not shown) that is designed to come<br>
into contact with the fluid medium for processing that<br>
flows inside the channel. The nature of the or each<br>
separating layer is selected as a function of the<br>
separation or filtering power that is to be obtained.<br>
At each of their terminal portions 3a, 3b, the<br>
filter elements 3 are mounted on a support plate 4 which<br>
is fixed in leaktight manner to each end of the case 2.<br>
In conventional manner, each support plate 4 has a number<br>
of passages 5 equal to the number of filter elements 3<br>
that are mounted inside the case 2 . Each passage 5 is<br>
preferably of tapering shape with its smaller end opening<br>
to the inside of the enclosure defined by the case 2.<br>
Each passage 5 enables a terminal portion of a tubular<br>
filter element 3 to be positioned. Each passage 5 is<br>
designed to be fitted with a sealing gasket 6 in<br>
accordance with the invention so as to ensure that the<br>
filter elements 3 are mounted in leaktight manner on the<br>
support plates 4. Between themselves and the case 2, the<br>
support plates 4 define a collecting enclosure 8 which<br>
communicates through at least one outlet 9 for delivering<br>
the filtrate, i.e. the fluid medium that has passed<br>
through the filter elements 3. In conventional manner,<br>
each support plate 4 is designed to have mounted thereon<br>
by any appropriate means a clamping backplate 11 that<br>
serves to deform the sealing gasket 6 in order to obtain<br>
good sealing.<br>
As can be seen more precisely in Figures 3 to 5,<br>
each sealing gasket 6 is in the form of a sleeve of axial<br>
height h that is not less than the height hps of the<br>
support plate 4. Thus, the sealing gasket 6 is capable<br>
of covering the filter element 3 over a length that is<br>
than the height hps of the support plate 4 .<br>
Under such conditions, the filter element 3 cannot come<br>
into contact with the support plate 4 so the filter<br>
element 3 is not subjected to friction or to erosion that<br>
might lead to breakage thereof.<br>
According to another characteristic of the<br>
invention, the sealing gasket 6 has an overlap bore 15<br>
for the filter element 3 which extends between one end 16<br>
of the sleeve and a shoulder 17 which co-operates with<br>
the other end 18 of the sleeve to define a fluidchanneling<br>
bore 19. As can be seen more clearly in<br>
Figure 3, the shoulder 17 serves as an abutment for the<br>
general portion of the filter element 3. This shoulder<br>
17 presents1; a surface of dimensions that are adapted to<br>
extend outside the free flow section Sc for the fluid.<br>
As can be seen more precisely in Figure 4, each filter<br>
element 3 comprises at least one, and in the example<br>
shown, three flow channels 3X lying within the free flow<br>
section Sc . In other words, this flow section Sc<br>
corresponds to the envelope containing all of the flow<br>
channels 3,, such that a peripheral surface exists around<br>
said section extending to the periphery of the filter<br>
element. Thus, the shoulder 17 presents dimensions that<br>
are adapted to extend outside the flow section Sc of the<br>
filter element so as to avoid impeding the flow of fluid<br>
flowing out from the channels 3:.<br>
According to a characteristic of the invention, the<br>
overlap bore 15 possesses a determined height hp and a<br>
determined diameter dp. Considering that the diameter of<br>
the filter element 3 is equal to dm, the ratio of the<br>
diameter dp of the overlap bore over the diameter dm of<br>
the filter element lies in the range 0.6 to 1, and the<br>
ratio between the height hp of the overlap bore 15 and<br>
the diameter dm of the filter element 3 lies in the range<br>
0 . 2 to 1.5.<br>
According to another characteristic of the<br>
invention, the channel bore 19 has a determined inside<br>
diameter dci and a determined inside height hci. The<br>
inside height hci of the channel bore 19 lies between the<br>
inside diameter dci of the channel bore divided by 2 and<br>
the inside diameter dci of the channel bore divided by<br>
24. Furthermore, the ratio of the inside diameter dci of<br>
the channel bore 19 divided by the diameter dm of the<br>
filter element 3 lies in the range 0.77 to 0.9.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment characteristic,<br>
each sealing gasket 6 possesses a determined outside<br>
diameter dee starting from the end 18 into which the<br>
channel bore 19 opens out, this determined diameter dee<br>
extending over a determined height hce so as to form an<br>
outside collar 21. Over its entire height, this collar<br>
21 thus presents a diameter that is constant. The ratio<br>
of the diameter dee of the collar 21 over the diameter dm<br>
of the filter element lies in the range 1.1 to 2.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment characteristic,<br>
facing each passage 5, each backplate 11 has a<br>
countersink: 23 formed in that one of the main faces of<br>
the backplate 11 that faces the adjacent support plate 4.<br>
Each countersink 23 is in communication with a through<br>
hole 24 formed in the backplate 11 and is adapted to<br>
receive a sealing gasket 6. More precisely, each<br>
countersink 23 is designed to receive the gasket 6<br>
starting from its end 18 so as to receive at least part<br>
of the collar 21 of the sleeve. According to an<br>
embodiment characteristic, the height hce of the outer<br>
collar 21 is such that the ratio of said height hce over<br>
the height hi of the countersink 23 lies in the range 1.5<br>
to 10.<br>
According to another characteristic of the<br>
invention, each sealing gasket 6 possesses on its<br>
outside, starting from the collar 21, a first portion 25<br>
of tapering shape and a second portion 26 of tapering<br>
shape extending to the end 16 into which the overlap bore<br>
15 opens out.<br>
According to an embodiment characteristic, the first<br>
tapering portion 25 possesses a maximum outside diameter<br>
dpclma, a minimum outside diameter dpclmi and an outside<br>
height hpcl. The outside height hpcl of the first<br>
tapering portion 25 lies between the diameter dm of the<br>
filter element divided by 5 and the diameter dm of the<br>
filter element divided by 20.<br>
According to another preferred embodiment<br>
characteristic, the ratio between the maximum outside<br>
diameter dpclma of the first tapering portion 25 over the<br>
diameter dee of the collar lies in the range 0.77 to 1,<br>
while the ratio of the minimum outside diameter dpclmi of<br>
the first tapering portion 25 over the maximum outside<br>
diameter dpclma of the first tapering portion lies in the<br>
range 0.83 to 1.<br>
According to another preferred embodiment<br>
characteristic, the second tapering portion 26 possesses<br>
a maximum outside diameter dpc2ma equal to the minimum<br>
outside diameter dpclmi of the first tapering portion 25.<br>
This second tapering portion 26 also possesses a<br>
determined minimum outside diameter dpc2mi and a<br>
determined outside height hpc2. The ratio of the<br>
diameter dp of the overlap bore 15 over the minimum<br>
outside diameter dpc2mi of the second tapering portion 26<br>
lies in the range 0.8 to 1, while the ratio of the<br>
diameter hpc2 of the second tapering portion 26 over the<br>
diameter dm of the filter element 3 lies in the range 0.2<br>
to 1.5.<br>
According to another characteristic of the<br>
invention, the overlap bore 15 has a groove 28 adjacent<br>
to the shoulder 17 in order to allow the constituent<br>
material of the sealing gasket 6 to creep. Thus, when<br>
the backplate 11 is clamped on the support plate 4, a<br>
portion of the gasket material can creep into the inside<br>
of the groove 28 while not obstructing the flow section<br>
Sc of the filter element.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment characteristic,<br>
the groove 28 presents a determined diameter dg and a<br>
determined height hg such that the ratio of the groove<br>
diameter dg over the diameter dm of the filter element<br>
lies in the range 1 to 1.5, while the ratio of the groove<br>
height hg over the inside diameter hci of the channel<br>
bore 19 lies in the range 0.2 to 1.<br>
In the above example, each support plate 4 has a<br>
series of distinct individual gaskets 6 each mounted in a<br>
respective passage 5. According to another embodiment<br>
characteristic shown more particularly in Figure 6, a<br>
series of sealing gaskets 6 for mounting on a support<br>
plate 4 can be interconnected via connection zones 30 in<br>
such a manner as to constitute a single part. Each<br>
connection zone 30 possesses a determined height hmp such<br>
that the ratio hmp over the height hce of the collar 21<br>
lies in the range 1 to 0.2.<br>
