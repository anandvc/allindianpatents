SUPPORTED CATALYSTS<br>
The present invention relates to supported catalysts suitable for the polymerisation of olefins and in particular to supported catalysts suitable for the preparation of polymers having broad molecular weight distributions and improved melt strengths.<br>
In recent years there have been many advances in the production of polyolefin copolymers due to the introduction of transition metal compounds and in particular metallocene catalysts. Metallocene catalysts offer the advantage of generally higher activity than traditional Ziegler catalysts and are usually described as catalysts which are single-site in nature. Because of their single-site nature the polyolefin copolymers produced by metallocene catalysts often are quite uniform in their molecular structure. For example, in comparison to traditional Ziegler produced materials, they have relatively narrow molecular weight distributions (MWD) and narrow Short Chain Branching Distribution (SCBD). Although certain properties of metallocene products are enhanced by narrow MWD, difficulties are often encountered in the processing of these materials into useful articles and films relative to Ziegler produced materials. In addition, the uniform nature of the SCBD of metallocene produced materials does not readily permit certain structures to be obtained.<br>
The use of these metal complex based olefin polymerisation catalysts is now well established. Typically the metallocene complex comprises a bis(cyclopentadienyl) zirconium complex for example bis(cyclopentadienyl) zirconium dichloride or bis(tetramethylcyclopentadienyl) zirconium dichloride. Examples of such complexes may be found in EP 129368, EP 206794, and EP 260130.<br>
In such catalyst systems the metal complex is used in the presence of a suitable<br><br>
activator. The activators most suitably used with such metallocene complexes are aluminoxanes, most suitably methyl aluminoxane (MAO). Other suitable activators are boron compounds, in particular perfluorinated boron compounds.<br>
More recently complexes having a single or mono cyclopentadienyl ring have been developed. Such complexes have been referred to as 'constrained geometry' complexes and examples of these complexes may be found in EP 416815 or EP 420436. In such complexes the metal atom eg. zirconium or titanium is in the highest oxidation state.<br>
Other complexes however have been more recently developed in which the metal atom may be in a reduced oxidation state. Examples of both the bis (cyclopentadienyl) and mono (cyclopentadienyl) complexes have been described in WO 96/04290 and WO 95/00526 respectively.<br>
The above monocyclopentadienyl metallocene complexes are utilised for polymerisation in the presence of a cocatalyst or activator. Typically activators are aluminoxanes, in particular methyl aluminoxane or compounds based on boron compounds. Examples of the latter are boranes, for example tris(pentafluorophenyl) borane, or borates such as trialkyl-substituted ammonium tetraphenyl- or tetrafluorophenyl-borates. Catalyst systems incorporating such borate activators are described in EP 561479, EP 418044 and EP 551277.<br>
When used for the gas phase polymerisation of olefins, metallocene complexes may typically be supported for example on an inorganic oxide such as silica. Such supports may be typically dehydrated by calcining before use or may be prerreated with an organoaluminium compound to passivate the surface of the silica.<br>
EP 495849 describes a silica supported catalyst system produced by reacting a mixture of triisobutylaluminium and trimethylaluminium with the water contained in an undehydrated support.<br>
US 5834393 describes in general terms the treatment of support materials with organomagnesium, organozinc, organoboron or organoaluminium compounds including mixtures thereof. The reference generally describes the use of both dehydrated and hydrdrated supports.<br>
WO 91/05810 describes the treatment of undehydrated silica with mixtures of trimethylalumimum and trisisobutylaluminium to produce silica-aluminoxane products subsequently treated with Group IVB and/or Group VB metallocenes.<br>
WO 97/43323 describes in example 7 the addition of trietnylaluminium to a calcined silica in the presence of a borate activator. The resultant silica is then further treated with trihexylaluminium.<br>
We have now surprisingly found that when dehydrated supports (ie. substantially free of water) are pretreated with more than one organoaluminium compound prior to contact with any other catalyst or cocatalyst/activator components the resultant supported catalysts may be used to prepare polymers having broad molecular weight distributions and improved melt strengths.<br>
Thus according to the present invention there is provided a supported catalyst system comprising<br>
(a)	a dehydrated support material,<br>
(b)	a transition metal compound, and<br>
(c)	an activator<br>
characterised in that said support material has been pretreated with at least two different organoaluminum compounds prior to contact with either or both the transition metal compound or the activator.<br>
By dehydrated support material is meant support material substantially free of water.<br>
Preferred support materials for use in the present invention are particulated solid support materials.<br>
The support material may be any organic or inorganic inert solid. However particularly porous supports such as talc, inorganic oxides and resinous support materials such as polyolefins, which have well-known advantages in catalysis, are preferred.. Suitable inorganic oxide materials which may be used include Group 2, 13, 14 or 15 metal oxides such as silica, alumina, silica-alumina and mixtures thereof.<br>
Other inorganic oxides that may be employed either alone or in combination with the silica, alumina or silica-alumina are magnesia, titania or zirconia. Other suitable support materials may be employed such as finely divided polyolefins such as polyethylene.<br>
Suitable volume average particle sizes of the support are from 1 to 1000 /am and preferably from 10 to 100 u.m.<br>
The most preferred support material for use with the supported catalysts according to the process of the present invention is silica.<br>
Suitable silicas include Ineos ES70 and Davidson 948 silicas.<br>
The support material may for example be subjected to a heat treatment in order to reduce the water content or the hydroxyl content of the support material. For example prior to its use the support material maybe subjected to treatment at 100°C to 1000°C and preferably at 200 to 850°C in an inert atmosphere under reduced pressure, for example, for 5 hrs.<br>
Most preferably the support material is contacted with the organoaluminium compounds at room temperature in a suitable solvent, for example hexane.<br>
Preferred organoaluminium compounds are trialkyl aluminium compounds containing from 1 to 20 carbons atoms in each alkyl group. Preferred trialkyl aluminium compounds are trimethylaluminium, rriethylaluminium, triisopropylaluminium and triisobutylaluminium.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the present invention the support material is contacted sequentially with the organoaluminium compounds.<br>
The transition metal compound may be a compound of Groups IIIA to HB of the Periodic Table of Elements (TUPAC Version). Examples of such transition metal compounds are traditional Ziegler Natta, vanadium and Phillips-type catalysts well known in the art.<br>
The traditional Ziegler Natta catalysts include transition metal compounds from Groups IVA - VIA, in particular catalysts based on titanium compounds of formula MRx where M is titanium and R is halogen or a hydrocarbyloxy group and x is the oxidation state of the metal. Such conventional type catalysts include TiCl^ TiBr4, Ti(OEt)3Cl, Ti(OEt)2Bra and similar.

Other suitable transition metal compounds are those based on the late transition<br>
metals (LTM) of Group VIII for example compounds containing iron, nickel, manganese, ruthenium, cobalt or palladium metals.

Examples of such Tt-bonded anionic ligand groups are conjugated or non-conjugated, cyclic or non-cyclic dienyl groups, ally] groups, boratabenzene groups, phosphole and arene groups. By the term 7r-bonded is meant that the ligand group is bonded to the metal by a sharing of electrons from a partially delocalised Ti-bond.<br>
Each atom in the delocalized 7t-bonded group may independently be substituted with a radical selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, halogen, hydrocarbyl, halohydrocarbyl, hydrocarbyl, substituted metalloid radicals wherein the metalloid is selected from Group TVB of the Periodic Table. Included in the term "hydrocarbyl" are Cl - C20 straight, branched and cyclic alky! radicals, C6 - C20 aromatic radicals, etc. In addition two or more such radicals may together form a fused ring system or they may form a metallocycle with the metal.<br>

Product characteristics were determined using the following analytical procedures: Melt Flow Rate (2.16 kg)<br>
The melt flow rate (MFR) of the polymers was measured under conditions which conform to ISO 1133 (1991) and BS 2782:PART 720A:1979 procedures. The weight of polymer extruded through a die of 2.095 mm diameter, at a temperature of 190°C, during a 600 second time period and under a standard load of 2.16 kg is recorded. Molecular Structure Characterisation<br>
Various techniques (eg 13C NMR, GPC/LALLS, GPC/intrinsic viscosity, GPC/on-line viscometry and Theological flow activation energy, etc) have been developed to indicate the presence of long chain branching in polymers. Molecular Weight Distribution (Mw/Mn)<br>
Molecular weight distribution and associated averages, were determined by Gel Permeation Chromatography using a Waters GPCV 2000. The Millennium version 3.05.01 software supplied by Waters was used for data treatment. The solvent used was 1,2,4 Trichlorobenzene at 150°C, stabilised with 0.05% BHT. The nominal flow rate was 1 ml/min. Solutions of concentration around 0.1%w/w were prepared at 150°C for 2 hours on a hot plate, and the nominal injection volume was set at 217.5 ml. 2 Shodex AT806M/S and 1 Waters HT2 columns were used with a plate count (at half height) of typically 28,000. The system was calibrated using 12 polystyrene standards supplied by Polymer Laboratories.<br>
Apparent molecular weight distribution and associated averages, uncorrected for long chain branching, were determined using the differential refractometer detector alone. Molecular weight of Ps standards were converted to polyethylene molecular weights<br>
using the Mark Houwink parameters KpS = 1.75 xlO~4 dl/g, DpS= 0.67,<br>
Kpe - 4.1 x 10-4 dl/g, Dpe = 0.706 [Polymer Handbook, J. Bandrup and E.H.<br>
Immergut, 3rd Edition].<br>
This calibration has been checked against the NIST certified polyethylene SRM1475, the values obtained being 54,100 g/mol for Mw and 17,300 g/mol for Mn.<br>
Melt Strength<br>
The melt strength of the polymer is measured at 190°C, using a Gottfert Rheotens extensional rheometer in conjunction with a Rosand RH 7 Capillary Rheometer. This is achieved by extruding the polymer at a constant pressurer(P) through a die of 1.5 mm diameter and 30 mm in length, with a 90° entry angle. Once a given extrusion pressure is selected, the piston of the capillary rheometer will travel through its 15 mm diameter barrel at a speed that is sufficient to maintain that pressure constant. The nominal wall shear rate (7) for a given extrusion pressure can then be<br>
computed for the polymer at the selected pressure using the constant pressure ratio system of the rheometer.<br>
The extrudate is drawn with a pair of gear wheels at an accelerating speed (V).<br>
The acceleration ranges from 0.12 to 1.2 cm/s^ depending on the flow properties of the polymer under test. The drawing force (F) experienced by the extrudate is measured with a transducer and recorded on a chart recorder together with the drawing speed. The maximum force at break is defined as melt strength (MS) at a constant extrusion pressure (P) or at its corresponding extrusion rate (y). Three or four extrusion pressures (6, 8, 12, 16 MPa) are typically selected for each polymer depending on its flow properties. For each extrusion pressure, a minimum of 3 MS measurements is performed and an average MS value is then obtained.<br>
The derivative function of the extrusion pressure dependent melt strength, 8(MS)/5(P) for each polymer is computed from the slope (by a least square line fitting) of the plot of the average MS against pressure. The mean melt strength at an extrusion pressure of 16 MPa, MS (16 MPa), can be computed from the plot.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
