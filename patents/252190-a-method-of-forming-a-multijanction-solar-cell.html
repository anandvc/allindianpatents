				<td>The present invention relates to a method of forming a multijunction solar cell.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention.<br>
[002]   The present invention relates to the field of solar cell semiconductor devices, and particularly to integrated semiconductor structures including a multijunction solar cell including . a metamorphic layer.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art.<br>
[003]   Photovoltaic cells, also called solar cells, are one of the most important new energy sources that have become available in the past several years. Considerable effort has gone into solar cell development. As a result, solar cells are currently being used in a number of commercial and consumer-oriented applications. While significant progress has been made in this area, the requirement for solar cells to meet the needs of more sophisticated applications has not kept pace with demand. Applications such as satellites used in data communications have dramatically increased the demand for solar cells with improved power and energy conversion characteristics.<br>
[004]   In satellite and other space related applications, the size, mass and cost of a satellite power system are dependent on the power and energy conversion efficiency of the solar cells used. Putting it another way, the size of the payload and the availability of on-board services are proportional to the amount of power provided. Thus, as the payloads become more<br>
sophisticated, solar cells, which act as the power conversion devices for the on-board power systems, become increasingly more important.<br>
[005]   Solar cells are often fabricated in vertical, multijunction structures, and disposed in horizontal arrays, with the individual solar cells connected together in a series. The shape and structure of an array, as well as the number of cells it contains, are determined in part by the desired output voltage and current.<br>
[006]   Inverted metamorphic solar cell structures such as described in U.S. Patent No. 6,951,819 and M.W. Wanless et al., Lattice Mismatched Approaches for High Performance, III-V Photovoltaic Energy Converters (Conference Proceedings of the 31st IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference, Jan. 3-7, 2005, IEEE Press, 2005) present an important starting point for the development of future commercial products. The structures described in such prior art present a number of practical difficulties relating to the appropriate choice of materials and fabrication steps, in particular associated with the lattice mis-matched layers between the "lower" subcell (the subcell with the lowest bandgap) and the adjacent subcell.<br>
[007]   Prior to the present invention, the materials and fabrication steps disclosed in the prior art have not been adequate to produce a commercial viable, manufacturable, and energy efficient solar cell.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.         Objects of the Invention<br>
[008]   It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved multijunction solar cell.<br>
[009]   It is an object of the invention to provide an improved inverted metamorphic solar cell.<br>
[0010] It is another object of the invention to provide in a multi-cell structure, an interlayer between a second subcell and a third lattice-mis-matched subcell that maximizes the energy efficiency of the solar cell.<br>
[0011] It is still another object of the invention to provide a method of manufacturing an inverted metamorphic solar cell as a thin, flexible film.<br>
[0012] Additional objects, advantages, and novel features of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this disclosure, including the following detailed description as well as by practice of the invention. While the invention is described below with reference to preferred embodiments, it should be understood that the invention is not limited thereto. Those of ordinary skill in the art having access to the teachings herein will recognize additional applications, modifications and embodiments in other fields, which are within the scope of the invention as disclosed and claimed herein and with respect to which the invention could be of utility.<br>
2.        Features of the Invention<br>
[0013] Briefly, and in general terms, the present invention provides a solar cell including a semiconductor body having an upper surface; a multijunction solar cell disposed on the upper surfaces; a first solar subcell on the substrate having a first band gap; a second solar subcell disposed over the first subcell and having a second band gap smaller than the first band gap; and a grading interlayer disposed over the second subcell interlayer having a third band gap larger than the second band gap, and a third solar subcell over the second solar subcell such that the third solar subcell is lattice mis-matched with respect to the second subcell and the third subcell has a fourth band gap smaller than the third band gap.<br>
[0014] In another aspect, the present invention provides a method of forming a multijunction solar cell comprising an upper subcell, a middle subcell, and a lower subcell by providing a first substrate for the epitaxial growth of semiconductor material; forming a first solar subcell on said substrate having a first band gap; forming a second solar subcell over said first subcell having a second band gap smaller than said first band gap; and forming a grading interlayer over said second subcell having a third band gap larger than said second band gap forming said at least one lower subcell over said middle subcell such that said at least one lower subcell is lattice mismatched with respect to said middle subcell and said third subcell has a fourth band gap smaller than said second band gap.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
[0033] Details of the present invention will now be described including exemplary aspects and embodiments thereof. Referring to the drawings and the following description, like reference numbers are used to identify like or functionally similar elements, and are intended to illustrate major features of exemplary embodiments in a highly simplified diagrammatic manner. Moreover, the drawings are not intended to depict every feature of the actual embodiment nor the relative dimensions of the depicted elements, and are not drawn to scale. [0034] FIG. 1 depicts the multijunction solar cell according to the present invention after formation of the three subcells A, B and C on a substrate. More particularly, there is shown a substrate 101, which may be either gallium arsenide (GaAs), germanium (Ge), or other suitable material. In the case of a Ge substrate, a nucleation layer 102 is deposited on the substrate. On the substrate, or over the nucleation layer 102, a buffer layer 103, and an etch stop layer 104 are further deposited. A contact layer 105 is then deposited on layer 104, and a window layer 106 is deposited on the contact layer. The subcell A, consisting of an n+ emitter layer 107 and a p-type base layer 108, is then deposited on the window layer 106.<br>
[0035] It should be noted that the multijunction solar cell structure could be formed by any suitable combination of group III to V elements listed in the periodic table subject to lattice constant and band gap requirements, wherein the group III includes boron (B), aluminum (Al),<br>
gallium (Ga), indium (In), and thallium (T). The group IV includes carbon (C), silicon (Si),<br>
germanium (Ge), and tin (Sn). The group V includes nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), arsenic<br>
(As), antimony (Sb), and bismuth (Bi).<br>
[0036] In the preferred embodiment, the substrate 101 is gallium arsenide, the emitter layer 107<br>
is composed of InGa(Al)P, and the base layer is composed of InGa(Al)P.<br>
[0037] On top of the base layer 108 is deposited a back surface field ("BSF") layer 109 used to<br>
reduce recombination loss.<br>
[0038] The BSF layer 109 drives minority carriers from the region near the base/BSF interface<br>
surface to minimize the effect of recombination loss, hi other words, a BSF layer 109 reduces<br>
recombination loss at the backside of the solar subcell A and thereby reduces the recombination<br>
in the base.<br>
[0039] On top of the BSF layer 109 is deposited a sequence of heavily doped p-type and n-type<br>
layers 110 which forms a tunnel diode which is a circuit element to connect cell A to cell B.<br>
[0040] On top of the tunnel diode layers 110 a window layer 111 is deposited. The window<br>
layer 111 used in the subcell B also operates to reduce the recombination loss. The window<br>
layer 111 also improves the passivation of the cell surface of the underlying junctions. It should<br>
be apparent to one skilled in the art, that additional layer(s) may be added or deleted in the cell<br>
structure without departing from the scope of the present invention.<br>
[0041] On top of the window layer 111 the layers of cell B are deposited: the emitter layer 112,<br>
and the p-type base layer 113. These layers are preferably composed of InGaP and Ino.oisGaAs<br>
respectively, although any other suitable materials consistent with lattice constant and band gap<br>
requirements may be used as well.<br>
constant to achieve a transition in lattice constant from cell B to subcell C. The bandgap of layer 116 is l.Sev constant with a value slightly greater than the bandgap of the middle cell B. [0043] In one embodiment, as suggested in the Wanless et al. paper, the step grade contains nine compositionally graded steps with each step layer having a thickness of 0.25 micron. In the preferred embodiment, the interlayer is composed of InGaAlAs, with monotonically changing lattice constant.<br>
On top of the metamorphic buffer layer 116 another n+ window layer 117 is deposited. The window layer 117 improves the passivation of the cell surface of the underlying junctions. Additional layers may be provided without departing from the scope of the present invention.<br>
On top of the window layer 117 the layers of subcell C are deposited; the n+ type emitter layer 118 and the p type base layer 119. In the preferred embodiment, the emitter layer is composed of GalnAs and the base layer is composed of GalnAs with about a 1.0 ev bandgap, although any other semiconductor materials with suitable lattice constant and bandgap requirements may be used as well.<br>
On top of the base layer 119 of subcell C a back surface field (BSF) layer 120, preferably composed of GalnAsP, is deposited.<br>
Over or on top of the BSF layer 120 is deposited a p+ contact layer, preferably of p+ type InGaAs. [0044] FIG. 2 is a cross-sectional view of the solar cell of FIG. 1 after the next process step<br>

[0046] FIG. 4 is a cross-sectional view of the solar cell of FIG. 3 after the next process step according to the present invention in which a surrogate substrate, preferably sapphire, is attached. In the preferred embodiment, the surrogate substrate is about 40 mils in thickness, and is perforated with holes about 1mm in diameter, spaced 4 mm apart, to aid in subsequent removal of the substrate.<br><br>
[0047] FIG. 5 A is a cross-sectional view of the solar cell of FIG. 4 after the next process step<br>
according to the present invention in which the original substrate is removed by a sequence of<br>
lapping and/or etching steps in which the substrate 101, the buffer layer 103, and the etch stop<br>
layer 104, are removed. The etchant is growth substrate dependent.<br>
[0048] FIG. 5B is a cross-sectional view of the solar cell of FIG. 5 A from the solar cell of FIG.<br>
5 A from the orientation with the surrogate substrate 124 being at the bottom of the Figure.<br>
