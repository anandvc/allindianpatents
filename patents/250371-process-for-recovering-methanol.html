				<td>Process for recovering methanol<br>
The invention relates to an improved process for recovering<br>
methanol from mixtures containing methanol and water, which<br>
process requires less energy for separation.<br>
Propylene oxide may be produced by reacting propylene with<br>
hydrogen peroxide in the presence of a titanium-containing<br>
zeolite catalyst. Methanol is advantageously used as<br>
solvent in this process. When working up the reaction<br>
mixture resulting from this process, a mixture is obtained<br>
which contains methanol and water. Methanol has to be<br>
recovered from this mixture, in order to be able to return<br>
it to the epoxidation reaction and to be able to operate<br>
the process economically. The water arising from hydrogen<br>
peroxide and any water introduced into the process with<br>
aqueous hydrogen peroxide, has to be removed from the<br>
process. The recovery of methanol from the mixture<br>
containing methanol and water consumes a large proportion<br>
of the thermal energy expended on the process. To perform<br>
the process economically, there is therefore a need for an<br>
improved process for recovering methanol from a mixture<br>
containing methanol and water, wherein the method exhibits<br>
a reduced energy requirement.<br>
WO 02/02544 describes a process for the production of<br>
propylene oxide, in which working up of the reaction<br>
mixture results in a mixture which contains methanol, water<br>
and small quantities of hydrogen peroxide. The document<br>
describes separating off water from this mixture by<br>
distillation performed in two columns, wherein the<br>
pressures are so selected that the bottom of the column<br>
operated at low pressure is heated using the vapors from<br>
the second column, which is operated at high pressure. The<br>
coupling of the columns described in WO 02/02544 makes it<br>
possible to reduce the energy requirement for recovering<br>
methanol from the mixture.<br>
However, the need still remains for processes for<br>
recovering methanol which require less energy than the<br>
prior art. This object is achieved by the process according<br>
to the invention.<br>
The present invention provides a process for recovering<br>
methanol from mixtures containing methanol and water,<br>
wherein the process comprises multistage evaporation and a<br>
downstream series of distillation stages and wherein the<br>
bottoms obtained in the final evaporation stage of the<br>
multistage evaporation are supplied to the first<br>
distillation stage of the series of distillation stages.<br>
The multistage evaporation comprises at least two<br>
evaporation stages, wherein each evaporation stage<br>
comprises an evaporator and, in the multistage evaporation,<br>
the pressure is reduced from each evaporation stage to the<br>
next evaporation stage. The evaporator of the second and<br>
each subsequent evaporation stage is heated with the<br>
vaporous overhead of the in each case previous stage. The<br>
series of distillation stages comprises at least two<br>
distillation stages, wherein each distillation stage<br>
comprises a distillation column and an evaporator and<br>
wherein the bottoms from the in each case previous<br>
distillation stage are supplied to the second and each<br>
subsequent distillation stage. In the series of the<br>
distillation stages, the pressure is increased from each<br>
distillation stage to the next distillation stage and, with<br>
the exception of the final distillation stage, in each<br>
distillation stage the evaporator is heated in each case<br>
with the vaporous overhead of the distillation column of<br>
the subsequent distillation stage.<br>
Preferably, each evaporation stage additionally comprises a<br>
distillation column with a rectifying section, such that an<br>
overhead with a methanol content of more than 90 wt.%,<br>
preferably more than 95 wt.%, is obtained in each<br>
evaporation stage.<br>
The process according to the invention comprises multistage<br>
evaporation with at least two evaporation stages, wherein<br>
the pressure is reduced from each evaporation stage to the<br>
next. Each of the evaporation stages comprises an<br>
evaporator, wherein any evaporator may be used for the<br>
process according to the invention which is suitable for<br>
evaporation of methanol from mixtures containing methanol<br>
and water. Preferably, continuous-flow evaporators are used<br>
in the evaporation stages, which evaporators may be<br>
operated without a circulating pump. In each evaporation<br>
stage, the mixture is supplied in liquid form to the<br>
evaporator and vaporous vapors and liquid bottoms are<br>
obtained as a result of evaporation. The liquid bottoms are<br>
supplied in each case to the evaporator of the next<br>
evaporation stage. Due to the reduction in pressure from<br>
each evaporation stage to the next, no pump is generally<br>
necessary for this purpose.<br>
The evaporator of the first evaporation stage is heated<br>
with a heating medium, preferably with steam. The<br>
evaporator of the second and each subsequent condensation<br>
stage is heated with the vapors, i.e. the vaporous<br>
overhead, of the in each case previous stage.<br>
The number of evaporation stages is selected in accordance<br>
with the composition of the mixture from which methanol is<br>
to be recovered and preferably ranges from 3 to 5<br>
evaporation stages. The pressure gradation between the<br>
evaporation stages is so selected that the boiling point of<br>
the liquid stream supplied to the second evaporation stage<br>
is lower than the condensation temperature of the vapors<br>
from the preceding stage, such that the heat of<br>
condensation of the vapors is used to heat the evaporator<br>
and the vapors are condensed in the evaporator. The same<br>
also applies for the pressure gradation in the subsequent<br>
evaporation stages. The vapors obtained in the final<br>
evaporator of the multistage evaporation process are<br>
condensed in a separate cooler, wherein cooling water is<br>
preferably used for condensation of the vapors.<br>
The pressure in the first evaporation stage is preferably-<br>
selected to be in the range from 3 to 10 bar and<br>
particularly preferably 4 to 7 bar. The pressure is so<br>
selected that a sufficient pressure and temperature<br>
gradient is achieved over the series of evaporation stages<br>
and an economic heating medium, preferably steam at a<br>
pressure of 4 to 8 bar, may be used to heat the first<br>
evaporator. The pressure in the final evaporation stage is<br>
preferably selected to be in the range from 0.5 to 2 bar<br>
and particularly preferably 0.8 to 1.5 bar. The pressure is<br>
so selected that a sufficient pressure and temperature<br>
gradient is achieved over the series of evaporation stages<br>
and the vapors from the final evaporation stage may be<br>
condensed in an economic manner using cooling water.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the process according to the<br>
invention, each evaporation stage additionally comprises a<br>
distillation column with a rectifying section, such that an<br>
overhead with a methanol content of more than 90 wt.%,<br>
preferably more than 95 wt.%, is obtained in each<br>
evaporation stage The vaporous stream produced in the<br>
evaporator is supplied to the lower part of the<br>
distillation column. The liquid bottoms resulting in the<br>
evaporator may optionally also be supplied to the<br>
distillation column together with the vaporous stream. The<br>
distillation column may take the form of an apparatus<br>
separate from the evaporator. Likewise, it is also<br>
possible, however, for the evaporator and the associated<br>
distillation column to be constructed as one apparatus. At<br>
the top of the column, the vapors are removed in vapor form<br>
and supplied to the evaporator of the subsequent<br>
evaporation stage. A liquid stream of condensed vapors is<br>
fed into the upper part of the column, to produce reflux.<br>
The stream of condensed vapors used to produce reflux may<br>
be taken from the liquid stream which is obtained by-<br>
condensation of the vapors in the subsequent evaporation<br>
stage. Likewise, however, the vapors of all the evaporation<br>
stages may also be combined together and the liquid stream<br>
for producing reflux may be taken from the mixture of<br>
combined vapors. The liquid stream obtained by reflux in<br>
the bottom of the column is supplied together with the<br>
bottoms from the evaporator to the next evaporation stage.<br>
For the distillation column used in the evaporation stages<br>
in this preferred embodiment, the plate number and the<br>
reflux ratio are selected in accordance with the<br>
composition of the vaporous stream produced in the<br>
evaporator and the desired purity of the recovered<br>
methanol. The reflux ratio is here defined as the ratio of<br>
the mass of the stream fed in in liquid form as reflux to<br>
the mass of the vaporous vapors removed at the top of the<br>
column. The distillation columns used in the evaporation<br>
stages preferably comprise 2 to 10 and particularly<br>
preferably 3 to 6 theoretical plates. Preferably, columns<br>
are used in the series of evaporation stages which have a<br>
plate number which increases over the series. The<br>
distillation columns used in the evaporation stages may in<br>
principle be of any desired design and may for example take<br>
the form of plate columns or of packed columns having<br>
regular or irregular packing. The distillation columns in<br>
the evaporation stages are preferably operated at a reflux<br>
ratio in the range from 0.1 to 1 and particularly<br>
preferably 0.2 to 0.6. Preferably, the distillation columns<br>
are operated with a reflux ratio which increases over the<br>
series of evaporation stages.<br>
The process according to the invention additionally<br>
comprises a series of at least 2 distillation stages,<br>
wherein in this series the pressure is increased from each<br>
distillation stage to the next. Each of the distillation<br>
stages comprises a distillation column and an evaporator.<br>
The liquid bottoms obtained in the final evaporation stage<br>
of the multistage evaporation are supplied to the first<br>
distillation stage in the middle portion of the<br>
distillation column. The bottoms obtained in the<br>
distillation column of the preceding distillation stage is<br>
in each case supplied to the second distillation stage and<br>
each subsequent distillation stage in a middle portion of<br>
the distillation column. In the final distillation stage,<br>
the evaporator is heated with a heating medium, preferably<br>
with steam. The evaporators of the preceding distillation<br>
stages are in each case heated with the vaporous vapors of<br>
the distillation column of the immediately subsequent<br>
distillation stage. The vapors obtained at the top of the<br>
distillation column of the first distillation stage are<br>
condensed in a separate cooler, wherein cooling water is<br>
preferably used for condensation of the vapors. The number<br>
of distillation stages is selected in accordance with the<br>
composition of the mixture fed into the first distillation<br>
stage and the desired residual methanol content in the<br>
bottoms, obtained in the distillation column of the final<br>
distillation stage, and preferably amounts to two<br>
distillation stages.<br>
The pressure gradation in the series of distillation stages<br>
is so selected that the boiling point at the bottom of the<br>
distillation column of the first distillation stage is<br>
lower than the condensation temperature of the vapors from<br>
the distillation column of the second distillation stage,<br>
such that the heat of condensation of the vapors from the<br>
second distillation stage is used to heat the evaporator of<br>
the first distillation stage and the vapors are condensed<br>
in the evaporator. The same applies to the pressure<br>
gradation between the further distillation stages.<br>
In the first distillation stage, the pressure used is<br>
preferably of 0.5 to 2 bar and particularly preferably 0.8<br>
to 1.5 bar, such that a sufficient pressure and temperature<br>
gradient is achieved over the series of distillation stages<br>
and the vapors arising at the top of the column of the<br>
first distillation stage may be condensed economically with<br>
cooling water. The pressure in the final distillation stage<br>
is preferably selected to be in the range from 3 to 10 bar,<br>
particularly preferably 4 to 7 bar, so that a sufficient<br>
pressure and temperature gradient is achieved over the<br>
series of distillation stages, and an economic heating<br>
medium, preferably steam at a pressure of 4 to 16 bar, may<br>
be used to heat the evaporator of the final distillation<br>
stage.<br>
To produce reflux, a liquid stream of condensed vapors is<br>
fed in at the top of the column in the case of each<br>
distillation column of the distillation stages. The liquid<br>
stream may be taken from the condensed vapors obtained by<br>
condensation from the same column. Likewise, however, the<br>
vapors obtained in the distillation columns of the series<br>
of distillation stages may also be combined together and<br>
the liquid stream used to produce the reflux may be taken<br>
from the mixture of combined condensed vapors.<br>
For the distillation columns used in the series of<br>
distillation stages, the plate number and the reflux ratio<br>
are preferably so selected that an overhead with a methanol<br>
content of more than 90 wt.% and preferably more than 95<br>
wt.% is obtained in each column. The distillation columns<br>
used in the series of distillation stages preferably<br>
exhibit a separation effect of 10 to 40 theoretical plates.<br>
In principle, all types of distillation column construction<br>
are suitable, for example distillation columns with plates<br>
or distillation columns with packing, wherein both regular<br>
and irregular packing may be used. The reflux ratio in the<br>
columns is preferably so selected that it increases over<br>
the series of distillation stages from a reflux ratio in<br>
the range from 0.3 to 1 in the first column to a reflux<br>
ratio in the range from 0.5 to 3 in the final column.<br>
If the mixture containing methanol and water from which<br>
methanol is to be recovered still contains intermediate-<br>
boiling compounds with a boiling point between the boiling<br>
points of methanol and water, the distillation column of<br>
the final distillation stage may be provided with a side<br>
outlet from which a stream is taken which has an enriched<br>
content of the intermediate-boiling compound. For such an<br>
embodiment, the distillation column of the final<br>
distillation stage may also advantageously take the form of<br>
a dividing wall column, in order to obtain a stream with a<br>
high concentration of intermediate-boiling compounds.<br>
The process according to the invention is particularly<br>
suitable for the recovery of methanol from mixtures<br>
containing methanol in a concentration of 70 wt.% and<br>
above. The process according to the invention may<br>
advantageously be used for the recovery of methanol from<br>
mixtures which arise during working up of reaction mixtures<br>
which arise when epoxidizing propylene with hydrogen<br>
peroxide using methanol as solvent. Such mixtures obtained<br>
from working up the reaction mixture from propylene<br>
epoxidation typically contain 70 to 90 wt.% of methanol, up<br>
to 3 wt.% of intermediate-boiling compounds and up to 3<br>
wt.% of high-boiling compounds, the rest being water.<br>
Intermediate-boiling compounds are any compounds whose<br>
boiling point lies between the boiling points of methanol<br>
and water. High-boiling compounds are any compounds whose<br>
boiling point lies above the boiling point of water. To<br>
separate such mixtures, the process according to the<br>
invention is preferably carried out in such a way that,<br>
starting from a mixture with a methanol content of 70 wt.%<br>
or higher, a mixture with a methanol content in the range<br>
from 40 to 60 wt.% is obtained in multistage evaporation<br>
and the mixture is supplied to a series of distillation<br>
stages. The operating conditions of the evaporation stages<br>
and distillation stages are selected in each case such that<br>
overheads with a methanol content of more than 90 wt.% and<br>
preferably more than 95 wt.% are obtained.<br>
Figure 1 shows an embodiment of the method according to the<br>
invention with four-stage evaporation and a subsequent<br>
series of two distillation stages. The evaporation stages<br>
are provided with an in each case separately constructed<br>
distillation stage. Figure 1 shows only the evaporators,<br>
distillation columns and condensers required in the<br>
process. Pumps, intermediate containers and fittings also<br>
required for carrying out the process are not illustrated<br>
for the sake of clarity and may be added by a person<br>
skilled in the art in accordance with his/her specialist<br>
knowledge.<br>
In the most preferred embodiment, the process according to<br>
the invention is carried out in an arrangement<br>
corresponding to Figure 1.<br>
The process comprises four-stage evaporation, wherein each<br>
evaporation stage comprises a continuous flow evaporator<br>
and a distillation column with a rectifying section. The<br>
first evaporation stage with the evaporator (1) and the<br>
distillation column (2), which comprises a rectifying<br>
section with 3 theoretical plates, is operated at a<br>
pressure of 5 bar. The second evaporation stage with the<br>
evaporator (3) and the distillation column (4), which<br>
comprises a rectifying section with 3 theoretical plates,<br>
is operated at a pressure of 2.8 bar. The third evaporation<br>
stage with the evaporator (5) and the distillation column<br>
(6), which comprises a rectifying section with 4<br>
theoretical plates, is operated at a pressure of 1.8 bar.<br>
The fourth and final evaporation stage with the evaporator<br>
(7) and the distillation column (8) with a rectifying<br>
section with 6 theoretical plates is operated at a pressure<br>
of 1.0 bar. The fourth evaporation stage additionally<br>
comprises a vapor condenser (9).<br>
Downstream of the four-stage evaporation is a series of two<br>
distillation stages. The first distillation stage comprises<br>
the distillation column (10) with a separation effect of 18<br>
theoretical plates, an evaporator (11) incorporated into<br>
the column and a vapor condenser (12) and is operated at a<br>
pressure of 1 bar. The second distillation stage comprises<br>
the distillation column (13) with a separation effect of 17<br>
theoretical plates and the evaporator (14) incorporated<br>
into the column and is operated at a pressure of 4 bar.<br>
The stream (15) from which the methanol is to be recovered<br>
and which has a methanol content of 75 to 85 wt.%, an<br>
intermediate-boiling compound content of up to 3 wt.% and a<br>
high-boiling compound content of up to 1 wt.%, the rest<br>
being water, is supplied to the evaporator (1) of the first<br>
evaporation stage. The evaporator (1) is heated via the<br>
stream (16) by steam under a pressure of 4 bar. The<br>
quantity of steam supplied to the evaporator (1) is<br>
selected such that approximately 25 wt.% of the stream (15)<br>
supplied is evaporated and supplied to the distillation<br>
column in vapor form as stream (17). The liquid bottoms<br>
arising in the evaporator at a temperature of approx. 118°C<br>
are supplied as stream (18) to the evaporator of the second<br>
evaporation stage. Vapor condensate in liquid form is fed<br>
in via stream (19) at the top of the distillation column<br>
(2), such that a reflux ratio of 0.2 is obtained. The<br>
vaporous vapors obtained at the top of the distillation<br>
column (2) are supplied as stream (20) to the evaporator<br>
(3) of the second evaporation stage as a heating medium.<br>
The liquid stream (21) arising at the bottom of the<br>
distillation column is supplied, together with the stream<br>
(18), to the evaporator of the second evaporation stage.<br>
In the second evaporation stage, the vaporous vapors of the<br>
first evaporation stage are condensed in the evaporator (3)<br>
and obtained as a liquid vapor condensate (22). The stream<br>
(23) evaporated thereby is supplied to the distillation<br>
column (4). The liquid bottoms (24) obtained in the<br>
evaporator are supplied at a temperature of approximately<br>
100°C to the evaporator (5) of the third evaporation stage.<br>
Liquid vapor condensate is fed in at the top of the<br>
distillation column 4 via stream (25) to produce reflux,<br>
such that a reflux ratio of 0.25 is obtained. The vaporous<br>
vapors obtained at the top of the column 4 are supplied via<br>
stream (2 6) to the evaporator (5) of the third evaporation<br>
stage as a heating medium. The liquid product arising at<br>
the bottom of the column (4) is supplied as stream (27),<br>
together with stream (24), to the evaporator (5) of the<br>
third evaporation stage.<br>
The vaporous vapors obtained in the evaporator of the<br>
second evaporation stage are condensed in the evaporator<br>
(5) of the third evaporation stage and the liquid<br>
condensate is combined with the stream (22). The vaporous<br>
stream (28) produced in the evaporator (5) is supplied to<br>
the distillation column (6). The liquid bottoms of the<br>
evaporator (5) are supplied at a temperature of approx.<br>
87°C to the evaporator (7) of the fourth and final<br>
evaporation stage. Liquid vapor condensate is fed in at the<br>
top of the distillation column (6) via stream (30), such<br>
that a reflux ratio of 0.35 is obtained. The vaporous<br>
vapors arising at the top of the column (6) are supplied<br>
via stream (31) to the evaporator (7) of the fourth<br>
evaporation stage as heating medium. The liquid product<br>
obtained at the bottom of the column (6) is supplied as<br>
stream (32) together with stream (29) to the evaporator of<br>
the fourth evaporation stage.<br>
In the evaporator (7) of the fourth evaporation stage, the<br>
vaporous vapors (31) from the third evaporation stage are<br>
condensed and the condensate is combined with the stream<br>
(22). The product stream (33) evaporated in the evaporator<br>
(7) is supplied to the distillation column (8). Liquid<br>
vapor condensate is fed in as stream (34) at the top of the<br>
distillation column (8), such that a reflux ratio of 0.4 is<br>
obtained. The vaporous vapors obtained at the top of the<br>
column (8) are condensed as stream (35) in the condenser<br>
(9) and the liquid condensate is combined with the stream<br>
(22). The liquid product (36) obtained at the bottom of the<br>
column (8) is combined with the liquid bottoms of the<br>
evaporator (7) and supplied as stream (3 8) to the first<br>
distillation stage.<br>
The liquid stream (38) leaving the multistage evaporation<br>
still contains around 45 to 50 wt.% of methanol and is<br>
supplied to the distillation column (10) of the first<br>
distillation stage. The vaporous vapors (39) obtained at<br>
the top of the distillation column (10) are condensed in<br>
the condenser (12) and a proportion of the resultant vapor<br>
condensate is fed in with stream (40) as reflux at the top<br>
of the column (10), such that a reflux ratio of 0.4 is<br>
obtained. The remaining proportion of the condensed vapors<br>
is combined with stream (22). The liquid bottoms (41)<br>
obtained in the distillation column (10) are supplied to<br>
the distillation column (13) of the second distillation<br>
stage. The evaporator (14) of the second distillation stage<br>
is heated via stream (42) by steam under a pressure of 8<br>
bar, such that a bottoms temperature of approx. 143°C is<br>
established. The vaporous vapors obtained at the top of the<br>
distillation column (13) are supplied as stream (43) to the<br>
evaporator (11) of the first distillation stage as a<br>
heating medium. Some of the vapors condensed in the<br>
evaporator (11) are recycled as stream (44) as reflux to<br>
the top of the column (13), such that a reflux ratio of 1.1<br>
is obtained. The remainder of the condensed vapors is<br>
combined with stream (22). At the bottom of the column (13)<br>
a stream (45) is obtained, which only has a residual<br>
methanol content of less than 0.5 wt.%. The vapor streams<br>
(20), (26), (31), (35), (39) and (43) arising in the<br>
process are combined after condensation and yield a product<br>
stream (46) which contains more than 90 wt.% of methanol<br>
and less than 4 wt.% of water.<br>
In this embodiment, the energy requirement for recovering<br>
methanol is around 157 kWh/t of methanol. In contrast, the<br>
requirement is around 44 7 kWh/t of methanol for the<br>
recovery of methanol in a single column without heat<br>
integration. With the process known from WO 02/02544 using<br>
two columns with heat integration, the energy requirement<br>
is around 246 kWh/t of methanol. The process according to<br>
the invention with heat integration both in the multistage<br>
evaporation and in the subsequent series of distillation<br>
stages thus makes it possible to save approximately 65% of<br>
the heating energy required compared with methanol recovery<br>
without heat integration. An energy saving of approx. 3 6 %<br>
is obtained relative to the method known from WO 02/02544.<br>
WE CLAIM: <br>
1. A process for recovering methanol from mixtures containing methanol and<br>
water, comprising:<br>
a) a multistage evaporation with a series of at least two evaporation stages,<br>
wherein each evaporation stage comprises an evaporator (1,3,5,7) and provides<br>
a vaporous overhead product, in the multistage evaporation the pressure is<br>
reduced along the series of evaporation stages and the evaporator of the second<br>
evaporation stage and each subsequent evaporation stage is heated with the<br>
vaporous overhead product of the preceding stage, and<br>
b) a series of at least two distillation stages, wherein each distillations stage<br>
comprises a distillation column (10, 13) and an evaporator (11, 14) and provides<br>
a bottoms product (41, 45) and a vaporous overhead product (39, 43), the<br>
bottoms product is supplied to the subsequent distillations stage along the series<br>
of distillation stages, the pressure is increased along the series of distillation<br>
stages and wherein, with the exception of a final distillation stage, in each<br>
distillation stage the evaporator is heated by the vaporous overhead product of<br>
the subsequent distillation stage,<br>
wherein the bottoms product obtained in the final evaporation stage of the<br>
multistage evaporation is supplied to the first distillation stage of the series of<br>
distillation stages.<br>
2. A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the multistage evaporation<br>
comprises 3 to 5 evaporation stages.<br>
3. A process as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the pressure in the<br>
first evaporation stage is in the range from 3 to 10 bar, preferably 4 to 7 bar and<br>
the pressure in the final evaporation stage is in the range from 0.5 to 2 bar,<br>
preferably 0.8 to 1.5 bar.<br>
4. A process as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein each<br>
evaporation stage additionally comprises a distillation column (2,4,6,8) with a<br>
rectifying section, such that an overhead with a methanol content of more than<br>
90 wt.%, preferably more than 95 wt.%, is obtained in each evaporation stage.<br>
5. A process as claimed in claim 4, wherein the rectifying section exhibits in<br>
each case a separation effect of 2 to 10 theoretical plates and is operated with a<br>
reflux ratio in the range from 0.1 to 1.<br>
6. A process as claimed in claim 5, wherein in each evaporation stage the<br>
rectifying section exhibits a separation effect of 3 to 6 theoretical plates.<br>
7. A process as claimed in claim 5 or claim 6 wherein in each evaporation<br>
stage the rectifying section is operated with a reflux ratio in the range from 0.2<br>
to 0.6.<br>
8. A process as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein the<br>
series of distillation stages comprises two distillation stages.<br><br><br>
Disclosed is a method for recovering methanol from mixtures containing<br>
methanol and water. Said method comprises multistage evaporation<br>
with the integration of heat, the pressure being decreased from one stage<br>
to the next, followed by a series of distillation stages with the integration<br>
of heat, the pressure being increased from one stage to the next. The<br>
inventive method allows the amount of energy required for recovering<br>
methanol to be reduced.</td>
