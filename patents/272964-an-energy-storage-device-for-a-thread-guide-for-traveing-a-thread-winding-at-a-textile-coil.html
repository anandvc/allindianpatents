				<td>Description:<br>
Energy accumulator (storage) for a finger thread fiber guide of a cross coils producing textile<br>
machine.<br>
The invention pertains to an energy accumulator according to the description of the patent claim no. 1.<br>
It is known, that for production of textile spools (coils) at least two pre-conditions must be fulfilled. On the one hand the textile spool must be displaced (shifted) in rotation and on the other hand the thread fibers increasing on the rotating textile spools must be traversed along the coil axis.<br>
When the thread fiber is traversed there very slowly, then there develops a textile spool with most extensive (far reaching) parallel windings. If such a textile spool possesses a larger volume and possesses essentially flat front-sides (interface) attached right angle to the spool axis, then on both sides of the windings limiting discs are required.<br>
These boundary discs can be avoided, if the thread fiber is traversed so quickly, mat there results a cross winding.<br>
Since modern textile machines operate during the production of the cross coils knowingly with relatively high winding speeds, also in case of the traversing of the increasing (leading) thread fiber a very high rate of traversing is required.<br>
In connection with the traversing of thread fibers during the production of the so-called<br>
cross coils traverse motion arrangements iridizing, in the most different forms of<br>
execution are known.<br>
Besides so-called small belt thread fiber guides, for example, thread fiber guide cylinders or also finger thread fiber guides developed preferably as grooved drums (cylinders) are in action.<br>
Such finger thread fiber guides are there, as a rule, admitted in each case by a separate electro mechanical drive.<br>
In the EP 0 838 422 Al, for example, a finger thread fiber guide is described, which is admitted^mpacted)by such a separate electro-mechanical drive. In the range of the stroke-ends of the finger thread fiber guide, moreover, energy accumulator in form of helical springs are attached, which support the reversal of the guide motion of the thread fiber guide and there both de-load its drive as well as should reduce the duration of the thread fiber guide at the stroke ends. The energy accumulators are mechanically adjustable in their position, so that the stroke (lift) of the thread fiber guide can be adjusted, in order to avoid, for example, bulged edges at the cross coil.<br>
Such energy accumulators display, however, various disadvantages.<br>
By the relatively jerky braking of the thread fiber guide during occurrence on the respective energy accumulator the total transferring system, for example, is stressed to the maximum and must, therefore, display a considerable stability, what the substance and therewith the mass movement of inertia of the shifting system increases significantly.<br>
In case of changing frequencies of 30 Hz and more there plays, however, the mass moment of inertia already a considerable role for the drive. Further, during impact of the thread fiber guide on the energy accumulator a sound is generated, which sums-up itself in case of long textile machines with many such displacing (shifting) systems , accordingly.<br>
When the drive of the thread fiber guide is controlled by a regulator, there results in the sphere of the immersion of the thread fiber guide in the energy accumulator, moreover, load jumps, which impair (hinder) the quality of the regulation of the regulator, considerably.<br>
It has, therefore, already been proposed to insert energy accumulator, whose potential energy increases constantly for the point of inversion of the finger thread fiber guide.<br>
The DE 199 60 024 Al describes such a finger thread fiber guide, which is admitted (impacted) by an electro-mechanical drive and is simultaneously connected with at least one torsion spring fixed rigidly at the drive housing, preferably at a helical spring.<br>
Since the potential energy of such a spiral spring increases constantly there towards the dead centers of the traversing range, there builds a driven finger thread fiber guide, at which such a spiral spring is connected, one essentially harmonically oscillating mechanical system.<br>
As possible weak point of such a changing arrangement functioning smoothly both in the theory as well as in the practice and well controllable was, however, confirmed as the torsion spring, whose longevity can perhaps not be adequate, with certainty for the high requirements, which are placed to such transferring systems.<br>
Proceeding from the earlier mentioned state of the art technique the invention has, therefore, the task as basis, to develop an energy accumulator of the earlier described sort so further, that on the one hand the potential energy of this energy accumulator increases constantly there for the dead centers of the traverse-range and on the other hand a high longevity of the energy accumulator is guaranteed.<br>
This problem is solved, in accordance with the invention, with the help of an energy accumulator, which displays the features described in the distinguishing marks of the patent claim no. 1.<br>
Advantageous developments of the invention are object of the sub-patent claims.<br>
The insertion of a magnetic energy accumulator, which displays at the least two stationary and one permanent magnet traversable with the thread fiber guide, has the advantage, that such an arrangement is not subjected to any mechanical abrasion and therefore possesses an almost unlimited longevity.<br>
Further, such energy accumulators are producible relatively cost conducive and operate under all operating conditions extremely dependably.<br>
In the advantageous form of execution both the stationary permanent magnets, as described in patent claims no. 2 and 3, are integrated in a magnet accepting plate (platter), which from their side is attached on the end-side at the motor housing of the electromechanical drive of the finger thread fiber guide.<br>
The magnet platter displays there a base plate and two bearing brackets projecting backwards to the base plate with bearing bore-wholes for stationary permanent magnets.<br>
A magnet platter developed in such a manner represents during the coiling operation a stable support for the magnetic forces occurring between the permanent magnets.<br>
Besides that, such a magnet platter is producible, for example, in the die cast metal or injection molding method with low cost (cost conducively) and can be attached by propeller bolt or similar things easily and dependably at the motor housing of the thread fiber guide drive (patent claim no. 4).<br>
As is described in patent claim no. 5 the traversable permanent magnet is integrated in a switchgear lug, which from its side is jointed as rotation resistant with the motor shaft of the thread fiber guide drive.<br>
Also the switchgear lug is there advantageously attached with the help of propeller bolt at the motor shaft (patent claim no. 6). The advantages described in connection with the patent claims no. 2 to 4 hold good in addition also for the patent claims no. 5 and 6.<br>
The form of execution described in the patent claim no. 7 is compulsorily necessary, since only in case of such an arrangement of the pole of the permanent magnet the desired effect of a magnetic energy accumulator, which supports the reversion of the guide motion of the finger thread fiber guide, is achievable.<br>
The invention is clarified with further details in the following with the help of an example of execution represented in the drawings.<br>
It shows:<br>
Fig. 1 schematically a coiling position of a cross coil producing textile machine with<br>
a finger thread fiber guide, which displays an energy accumulator in<br>
accordance with the invention,<br>
Fig. 2 a perspective view to an electro magnetic drive of a finger thread fiber guide as well as a magnetic energy accumulator in accordance with the invention.<br>
In figure 1 in lateral view the operating position 2 of a cross coil producing textile machine is represented schematically. It concerns in the present case to a so-called cross coil automatic machine 1. On the operating positions 2 such cross coil automatic machine 1 as is known and, therefore, not clarified in details, the spinning cops 3, which are produced on a ring-spinning machine are rewinded (rewound) for large sized cross coils 5.<br>
The cross coils 5 are surrendered (handed over) after their fabrication with the help of a (not represented here) automatically operating maintenance aggregates, preferably of a cross coil changer, to a machine length cross coil transporting arrangements 7 and is transported to a spool loading station or similar things attached to a machine-end-side.<br>
Such cross coil automatic machines 1 display, as a rule, moreover a logistic arrangement in form of a spool and sleeve transport system 6. In this coil and sleeve transport system 6 there rotate, on transport platters 11, the spinning cops 3 and empty sleeves.<br>
From the sleeve transport system 6 in figure 1 only the cops supply (stretch) track 24, the reversing drivable accumulator stretch 25, one of the transverse transport stretches 26 leading to the spooling position 2 as well as the sleeve restoring stretch 27 are represented.<br>
The individual winding stations possess further, as is known and is, therefore, only indicated, to guarantee by various arrangements, the one orderly operation of this operating position 2.<br>
One of these equipment is, for example, the winding device 4. As is usual, the winding device 4 possesses a coil frame 8, which is supported in a rotary manner (pivoted) around an axis of rotation 12 and which, for example, towards fabrication of conical cross coils can be tiltable around a further, orthogonal to the axis attached to the axis of rotation 12.<br>
In the in figure 1 represented example of execution there lies the cross coil 5 during the spooling operation with its surface on a supporting roll and feed roll 9 and takes along with it this drive less supporting and pressing roll 9 by termination of friction. The drive of the cross coil takes place in this case through a (not represented here) speed (rpm) governable drive arrangement, which is .attached airectly at the coil frame 8 and<br>
is integrated in the spool frame 8.<br>
In alternative form of execution it is also obviously possible to provide a driven feed roll, which then drives the cross coil supported in a freely rotatable manner in the coil frame 8 as friction determined.<br>
Towards changing of the fiber thread 16 during the spooling process a thread changing<br>
arrangement 10 is provided.<br>
i<br>
Such a thread fiber-changing device 10 indicated schematically in the figure 1 is, for example, described in the DE 199 60 024 Al relatively extensively. The fiber thread changing arrangement 10 consists essentially of a finger-like developed thread fiber guide 13, which, admits by an electro-mechanical drive 14, traverses the fiber thread 16 between the front sides of the cross coil 5. As is indicated further in figure 1, the electromechanical drive 14 is moreover equipped with a magnetic energy storage (accumulator) 20, in accordance with the invention.<br>
Each operating position 2 of the cross coil automatic machine 1 displays, moreover, an operating position calculator 28, which is connected through a bus connection 15 to a central control unit 17.<br>
The pneumatic supply of the operating position 2 takes place through a suction air traverse 18, which for example, stands in contact through a vacuum piping 19 with a vacuum source 21.<br>
The electro-mechanical drive 14 only indicated in figure 1 and equipped with a magnetic energy accumulator 20 is represented perspectively in figure 2 for the finger thread fiber guide 13.<br>
As is evident, there displays the drive 14 a motor housing 22 with a back-sided mounting flange 23. Through the oblong hole (slotted hole) 28 in the attachment flange 23 it is possible that the drive 14 is fastened (attached) at the spooling position housing 29.<br>
The magnetic energy accumulator 20 displays, in accordance with the invention, at the least two stationary permanent magnets 30, 31 as well as at the least one permanent magnet 32 reversible with the thread fiber guide 13.<br>
The stationary permanent magnet 30, 31 are there integrated in a magnet platter (accepting plate) 33, whose base plate 41, for example, is attachable with the help of the propeller bolts 34 at the motor housing 22 of the electro-mechanical drive 14. The base plate 41 of the magnet platter (receiving plate) 33 displays for reception of the permanent magnets 30, 31 two single piece tip-stretched bearing brackets 35A and 35B with corresponding bearing bore holes 36A and 36B. In these bearing bore holes 35A and 35B the stationary permanent magnets 30 and 31 are fixed.<br>
Further in the range between the bearing bracket 35A and 35B a moveable switchgear lug 37 is attached, which is preferably rigidly attachable similarly by corresponding propeller bolts 38 as rotation proof on the motor shaft 39 of the drive 14 of the finger thread fiber guide 13. The switchgear lug 37 displays a through bore hole 40 towards acceptance of the traversing permanent magnets 32. The permanent magnets 30, 31, 32 are attached in their corresponding bearing sites in such a manner, that, in each case opposing poles stand opposite to each other.<br>
That means, between the stationary permanent magnets 30, 31 and the permanent magnet 32, supported in a traversable manner 32, there exist permanent magnetic forces, which work in the sense of "knocking off'.<br>
The magnetic forces acting on the traversable permanent magnet 32 lift themselves in the neutral position of the thread fiber guides 13 and thereby also of the switchgear lug 37, mutually. In case of a traversing of the fiber thread guide 13, for example, towards the point of inversion U1 there increases the potential energy of the knocking off magnetic forces between the south pole S of the permanent magnet 30 and of the south pole S of the permanent magnets 32 constantly, whereas simultaneously the potential energy of the magnetic forces between the north poles N of the permanent magnets 32 and 31 decreases.<br>
The maximum potential energy is achieved, in each case, in the points of inversion U1 and U2 and towards renewed acceleration of the thread fiber guide 13 utilized in its opposite direction.<br>
