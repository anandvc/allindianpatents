				<td>Description<br>
In modern communications systems it is known to transmit<br>
payload via packet-oriented networks. Payloads are, for<br>
example, digitized voice data, with the term "Voice over IP",<br>
or VoIP for short, being common for transmission of voice data<br>
via packet-oriented networks. The use of packet-oriented data<br>
transmission methods often results in losses in the quality of<br>
the payload being transmitted and these are often caused by<br>
conversions, delays or loss of payload packets in network<br>
nodes.<br>
Based on the often used, so-called internet protocol, also<br>
abbreviated to IP, reference will be made hereinafter using<br>
the term "IP terminal" to communication terminals that operate<br>
on the basis of a packet-oriented transmission method.<br>
In packet-oriented networks a connection between IP terminals<br>
can conventionally be routed via network nodes, such as what<br>
are known as routers, switches or gateways. In this connection<br>
routers switch data between packet-oriented sub-networks,<br>
while gateways can also provide a junction between different<br>
types of 1 irie-switched and/or packet-oriented networks.<br>
With a connection between two IP terminals the payloads may be<br>
routed in particular via a plurality of gateways, it being<br>
possible for each additional gateway in a transmission path of<br>
the payloads to have an adverse effect on the payload quality<br>
- i.e. for example a voice quality. Furthermore, a distinction<br>
is often made with packet-oriented connections between<br>
signaling connections and payload connections, it being<br>
possible for signaling and payload connections between two IP<br>
terminals to have different connection paths in the network.<br>
To improve the voice quality IP terminals, which endorse the<br>
ITU-T recommendation H.323 (ITU-T: International<br>
Telecommunication Union - Telecommunications Standardizations<br>
Sector) and what is referred to as the Direct Media Connection<br>
(DMC), communication payloads can be transmitted directly<br>
between the IP terminals while avoiding the gateways and<br>
thereby avoiding additional conversions and delays. In some<br>
cases it has continued to prove problematical that, with<br>
conventional DMC methods, when switching through the payload<br>
connection there is a delay before a definitive end-to-end<br>
connection is produced between the IP terminals, so with voice<br>
connections the start of a call is potentially not transmitted<br>
to a conversation partner.<br>
The object of the invention is to disclose a method in which<br>
establishing of communication between two communication<br>
terminals in a packet-oriented communications network is<br>
improved. It is a further object of the invention to disclose<br>
a communications system and a communications terminal for<br>
carrying out the method.<br>
This object is achieved by a method with the features of claim<br>
I and by a communications system according to claim 11 and a<br>
communications terminal according to claim 12.<br>
Advantageous embodiments and developments of the invention are<br>
disclosed in the dependent claims.<br>
In the method ciccording to the invention, to establish<br>
communication, in particular of media such as voice, video,<br>
photos, fax or multimedia, in a packet-oriented communications<br>
network between a calling and a called terminal, before a<br>
call-accepted signal by the called terminal, triggered by a<br>
message within the framework of call set-up signaling, a<br>
direct, first payload connection is established between the<br>
calling and the called terminal. This accordingly established,<br>
first payload connection is maintained. As a direct result of<br>
the call-accepted signal of the called terminal communication<br>
is triggered between the calling and called terminals by means<br>
of the established first payload connection.<br>
In the method according to the invention it is particularly<br>
advantageous that following initiation of a call set-up, the<br>
direct, first payload connection is established even before<br>
the call-accepted signal by the called terminal, so protracted<br>
establishment of a payload connection only when there is a<br>
call-accepted signal between the called and the calling<br>
terminals can be omitted. Since the first payload connection<br>
established for transmission of payload - for example a<br>
djgitized and encoded voice - is on standby it may be ensured<br>
that the payload can be transmitted simultaneous with the<br>
call-accepted signal without there being any connection<br>
delays. In particular the method according to the invention<br>
can ensure that, by way of the called device, the supplied<br>
communication can be processed without delay with the callaccepted<br>
signal and can be transmitted to the calling terminal<br>
via the first: payload connection already established, so the<br>
calling terminal can reach all of the communication incoming<br>
at the called terminal, without loss of an initial<br>
communication portion in an otherwise conventional time slot:<br>
between call-.accepted signal and switching-through of a<br>
payload connection. A gap in transmission of this kind or an<br>
excessive switch-through delay in payload transmission may<br>
therefore be avoided.<br>
When applying the invention to a voice connection via<br>
telephone, immediately after the receiver of a called<br>
telephone, as the called terminal, is picked up therefore, the<br>
sounds arriving at the microphone are processed - i.e. are in<br>
particular encoded - by the called telephone, as communication<br>
according to the invention, and transmitted to a calling<br>
telephone as the calling terminal via the payload connection<br>
already maintained. An otherwise frequently occurring loss of<br>
a voice portion immediately after the receiver has been picked<br>
up is thereby avoided.<br>
The call-accepted signal is in particular taken to mean<br>
actions which bring about acceptance of the signaled call setup<br>
signaling for switching through the payload connection.<br>
With telephones this is in particular the action of taking up<br>
a receiver or pressing of a key. Alternatively acceptance of<br>
the incoming connection can be automatically triggered,<br>
without manual intervention, in other terminals such as fax<br>
machines.<br>
A direct, first payload connection can be taken to mean a<br>
connection between two terminals which consists in particular<br>
in avoiding connection controllers such as gateways and/or<br>
gate keepers, tri an advantageous embodiment of the invention<br>
this is for example a direct media connection, in particular<br>
according to Direct Media Connection (DMC) specifications. A<br>
connection via network elements which only carry out<br>
transportation of data at a low level of the OSI-reference<br>
model (OSI: Open. Systems Interconnection) standardized by the<br>
ISO (International Organization for Standardization) - for<br>
example bridges, switches, routers, are'to be regarded as a<br>
direct connection according to the invention. Depending on the<br>
embodiment it may also be provided, in addition to the direct,<br>
first payload connection, that an additional payload<br>
connection routed via connection controllers is established<br>
between the terminals.<br>
In an advantageous development of the invention a connection<br>
controller, in particular a gatekeeper and/or a gateway, can<br>
be associated with the called and the calling terminals.<br>
Connection controllers of this type are for example provided<br>
to provide allocation of call numbers to IP addresses, with a<br>
respective connection controller only managing the terminals<br>
associated with it. The connection controllers may also be<br>
involved in signaling and in particular in call set-up<br>
signaling according to the invention. Within the framework of<br>
call set-up signaling the connection controllers can be<br>
involved in determining the codec (encoder/decoder) of the<br>
terminals and connection controllers that is to be used, the<br>
signaling path and the payload path in the communications<br>
network, encoding and/or further transmission parameters for<br>
the subsequent; payload connection. A call set-up signaling<br>
path can run via a plurality of connection controllers as a<br>
function of the network structure and grouping of the<br>
terminal.<br>
In a further advantageous development of the invention, before<br>
the call-accepted signal by the called terminal, triggered by<br>
a message within the framework of call set-up signaling, a<br>
second payload connection can be established between the<br>
called terminal and a connection controller - in particular a<br>
connection controller involved in call set-up signaling. The<br>
payload entering the calling terminal via the second payload<br>
connection is preferably processed at the calling terminal if<br>
there has been no call-accepted signal by the called terminal.<br>
With voice connections of the calling terminal this second<br>
payload connection can be used to transmit the ringing tone to<br>
indicate a clear or busy signal as an audible representation<br>
of the call status of the called terminal. The second payload<br>
connection can moreover be used to transmit announcements,<br>
option and/or input menus, generated by the connection<br>
controller or a further network node, to the calling terminal.<br>
In generalized terms and independently of the transmitted<br>
media type for the payload communication the second payload<br>
connection can be provided for transmission of additional<br>
communication between a connection controller and the calling<br>
terminal before the call-accepted signal by the called<br>
terminal, it being possible for the additional communication<br>
to be audio, video and/or multimedia information provided in a<br>
call set-up state, i.e. during call set-up and before the<br>
called terminal is answered, if generated by any desired<br>
network node that is different from the calling device.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment, before the call-accepted signal<br>
between the calling terminal and the called terminal a direct<br>
signaling connection associated with the first payload<br>
connection can be established between the calling terminal and<br>
the called terminal, in particular via the same data path in<br>
the communications network as the first payload connection.<br>
This can be established in addition to further signaling<br>
actions running via connection controllers and can<br>
advantageously be used for signaling for a direct connection<br>
according to DMC (Direct Media Connection), the direct<br>
signaling connection and the direct, first payload connection<br>
representing the DMC connection after the call-accepted<br>
signal.<br>
According to a further advantageous development of the<br>
invention, before the call-accepted signal by the called<br>
terminal, measures for call clearing suppression can be<br>
implemented by the calling terminal and/or the called<br>
terminal. This can therefore advantageously prevent/the first<br>
payload connection from being cleared, even before the callaccepted<br>
signal owing to a conventional time allowance being<br>
exceeded - for example a maximum period -of inactivity at a<br>
connection -, and therefore no longer being available for<br>
transmission of communication. In particular maintenance<br>
messages or packets, triggered by the call set-up signaling<br>
from the calling terminal to the called terminal, can be<br>
transmitted from the called terminal via the first payload<br>
connection to the calling terminal. A trigger time until a<br>
connection is cleared is also called a connection "time out"<br>
or is designated as the attainment of the maximum allowed<br>
"idle" time. The maintenance packets can be called "dummy",<br>
"keep alive" or "idle" packets and are transmitted by the<br>
called and/or the calling terminal. The respective receiving<br>
terminal can advantageously recognize on the basis of the<br>
content of an incoming packet whether it is a maintenance<br>
packet and in this case ignore or reject the contents. In an<br>
advantageous embodiment of the invention the calling terminal,<br>
induced by receipt of a maintenance packet, can transmit an<br>
additional maintenance packet or an acknowledgement conforming<br>
to protocol. The calling device can preferably transmit<br>
maintenance packets to the called terminal via the first<br>
payload connection provided only maintenance packets are<br>
received by the calling terminal via the first payload<br>
connection.<br>
By recognizing a payload packet that differs from the<br>
maintenance packets and/or a payload packet implicitly<br>
indicating a call-accepted signal, owing to the start of a<br>
transmission of communication contents, at the called<br>
terminal, in an advantageous embodiment of the invention the<br>
calling terminal can recognize and/or determine the'callaccepted<br>
signal of the called terminal with the aid of<br>
incoming payload packets via the first payload connection.<br>
This preferably takes place via a signaling connection without<br>
additional signaling, so advantageously only the first payload<br>
connection has to be monitored without additional connections<br>
of the calling terminal having to be observed. Since no<br>
separate signaling of the call-accepted signal is required<br>
existing protocols that are used do not need to be expanded<br>
for the invention. Delays through to transmission of the first<br>
payload packet to the calling terminal are also avoided, in<br>
particular if transmission of.maintenance packets is<br>
terminated by the called terminal when it recognizes the callaccepted<br>
signal, and the pending payloads are transmitted<br>
immediately - in particular without further delay or explicit<br>
signaling - via the first payload connection.<br>
Triggered by reception of a payload packet, indicating the<br>
call-accepted signal, at the calling terminal via the first<br>
payload connection, in an advantageous embodiment of the<br>
invention the call-accepted signal of the called terminal can<br>
be accepted by the calling terminal without acknowledgement by<br>
the payloads received via the first payload connection being<br>
processed in the calling terminal and being output at an<br>
output unit and in response thereto a message that is<br>
conventional in the connected state being transmitted to the<br>
called terminal. The calling terminal can also reject payload<br>
entering via the second payload connection and payload at the<br>
calling terminal can accordingly be transmitted via the first<br>
payload connection and no longer via the second payload<br>
connection. There is thus a changeover at the calling terminal<br>
from the second to the first payload connection without<br>
explicit signaling messages for announcing or triggering this<br>
changeover being sent or received via a signaling connection.<br>
The above advantages, developments and embodiments apply<br>
analogously to the communications system according to the<br>
invention and to the communications terminal according to the<br>
invention in addition to applying to the method according to<br>
the invention.<br>
An exemplary embodiment of the invention will be described in<br>
more detail hereinafter with reference to the drawings, in<br>
which schematically:<br>
Fig. 1 shows a communications system and a message flow and<br>
essential method steps within the framework of establishing<br>
communication in the communications system, and<br>
Fig. 2 shows a flow diagram of a calling and a called terminal<br>
in the communications system for establishing communication.<br>
Fig. 1A to 1C schematically show the components of a packetoriented<br>
communications system. The components are, in<br>
particular, a calling first terminal EG1, a called second<br>
terminal EG2 and three connection controllers GW1, GW2 and<br>
GW3. Said components are coupled via an IP network IPN as a<br>
packet-oriented communications network according to the<br>
invention, the messages and connections mentioned below being<br>
based on IP-based concepts. The terminals EG1 and EG2 are IPbased<br>
voice terminals and are visualized in figures 1A to 1C<br>
as telephones. The connection controllers GW1, GW2, GW3 are<br>
shown as rectangles and in the present exemplary embodiment<br>
fulfill gateway and gatekeeper functionalities. This means in<br>
particular that, owing to the gatekeeper functionality, the<br>
respective terminals EG1, EG2 are allocated to a specific<br>
connection controller and, furthermore, the respective<br>
connection controller, owing to its gateway functionality,<br>
allows a transition between sub-networks of the packetoriented<br>
communications system and a transition to lineoriented<br>
or other packet-oriented communications systems.<br>
The communications system is configured in such a way that the<br>
first terminal EG1 is registered with the first connection<br>
controller GW1 and the second terminal EG2 with the second<br>
connection controller GW2. The first connection controller GW1<br>
can moreover route connections to the third connection<br>
controller GW3 and this, owing to its configuration, can in<br>
turn transmit messages and connections to the second<br>
connection controller GW2 and to the first connection<br>
controller GW1. The second connection controller GW2 is<br>
configured in such a way that it can transmit messages to the<br>
third connection controller GW3. Direct communication between<br>
the first connection controller GW1 and the second connection<br>
controller GW2 should be possible via the IP network IPN,<br>
although it is assumed that the two connection controllers GW1<br>
and GW2 are not reciprocally known, so a connection is in each<br>
case made via an intermediate connection controller - the<br>
third connection controller GW3 in this case.<br>
IP addresses are allocated to all terminals and connection<br>
controllers shown in figures 1A to 1C, with only the first IP<br>
address IP1 associated with the first terminal EG1 and the<br>
second IP address IP2 associated with the second terminal EG2<br>
being shown. Furthermore the two terminals EG1 and EG2 have a<br>
call number for addressing in the voice communications system,<br>
only the call number RUN02 associated with the second terminal<br>
EG2 being shown in Fig. 1.<br>
Directed messages are shown in Fig. 1 as directed arrows with<br>
arrow tip in the transmission direction and non-directed<br>
messages and connections are shown in the figures as double<br>
arrows. Signaling connections are shown in broken lines and<br>
payload connections in solid lines.<br>
Establishment of voice communication between the calling first<br>
terminal EG1 and the called second terminal EG2 will be<br>
described hereinafter with reference to Fig. 1. Initial<br>
triggers in this connection are the lifting of the telephone<br>
receiver and dialing of the call number RUNO2 at the first<br>
terminal EG1. Triggered thereby between the first terminal EG1<br>
and the first connection controller GW1 is a signaling<br>
connection SIG for the purpose of setting up a call, within<br>
the framework of which a signaling message MSIG is transmitted<br>
from the first terminal EG1 to the first connection controller<br>
GW1. In particular the target call number RUNO2 of the second<br>
called terminal EG2 and the transmission IP address IP1 of the<br>
first terminal EG1 are transmitted as the parameters. A<br>
signaling message MSIG of this type could for example be a<br>
setup message according to the ITU-T recommendation H.323<br>
(ITU-T: : International Telecommunication Union -<br>
Telecommunications Standardizations Sector) or an invite<br>
message according to the SIP protocol (SIP: Session Initiation<br>
Protocol) of the IETF workgroup (IETF: Internet Engineering<br>
Task Force).<br>
The first connection controller GW1 then checks whether a<br>
terminal with the second call number RUN02 is registered with<br>
it. It is not in the present embodiment.. The first connection<br>
controller GW1 then routes the call set-up signaling to the<br>
next configured routing node. This is the third connection<br>
controller GW3 in the present embodiment. In turn a signaling<br>
message MSIG is transmitted together with the target call<br>
number RUNO2 and the transmission IP address IP1. In the<br>
present exemplary embodiment the target call number RUN02 is<br>
not registered with the third connection controller GW3<br>
either. The third connection controller.GW3 then transmits a<br>
query to further connection controllers and this includes in<br>
particular a query to the second connection controller GW2<br>
(Fig. 1A shows only the query to the second connection<br>
controller GW2 by a signaling message MSIG) • A signaling<br>
connection is therefore established between the third<br>
connection controller GW3 and the second connection controller<br>
GW2 via which a signaling message MSIG is transmitted with said<br>
parameters.<br>
The second connection controller GW2 checks the terminals<br>
registered with it and recognizes that, associated with call<br>
number RUNG2, the second device EG2 is registered with it. The<br>
second connection controller GW2 determines the second IP<br>
address IP2 of the second terminal EG2 with the aid of call<br>
number RUNO2 arid internal configuration data. A signaling<br>
message MSIG is then sent to this IP address IP2 with the IP<br>
address IP1 of the first terminal EG1 as parameters. Signaling<br>
SIG is therefore continuously established from the first<br>
terminal EG1 via the connection controllers GW1, GW3 and GW2<br>
to the second called terminal EG2. Fig. 1A does not show<br>
acknowledgements within the framework of signaling SIG for<br>
reasons of clarity. Owing to the incoming signaling SIG an<br>
incoming call is visually or acoustically signaled to a user<br>
of terminal EG2 at the second terminal EG2, in particular by<br>
ringing of the phone. Fig. IB indicates -this by a star next to<br>
the telephone receiver of the second terminal EG2.<br>
A first payload connection Nl between the calling first<br>
terminal EG1 and the - from the perspective of the first<br>
terminal EG1 - last, gateway in the chain of signaling SIG,<br>
i.e. the second connection controller GW2, and a payload<br>
connection N2 between the second connection controller GW2 and<br>
the called terminal EG2 will be established hereinafter. Both<br>
payload connections are active, and this is indicated in the<br>
drawings by a subscripted "A". The payload connection Nl as<br>
the second payload connection according to the invention is<br>
used in particular in this connection to generate and transmit<br>
to the first terminal EG1 the ringing tone in the receiver, so<br>
a user at the first terminal EG1 recognizes that the call<br>
request has been signaled through to the second terminal EG2.<br>
The payload connection Ni can, moreover, be used to transmit<br>
automatic announcements, to provide call centre option menus -<br>
for example by IVR systems (IVR: Interactive Voice Response),<br>
voice and/or key actions carried out at the first terminal EG1<br>
being transmitted to the connection controller GW2 via the<br>
payload connection Nl.<br>
Also triggered by the signaling message MSiG entering within<br>
the framework of call set-up signaling at the called second<br>
terminal EG2, even before the call-accepted signal by the<br>
called terminal EG2, is the establishment of a direct<br>
signaling connection SIGD and a direct payload connection ND<br>
as the first payload connection according to the invention, in<br>
each case as a direction connection to the first terminal EG1.<br>
A direct connection in this connection is a connection which<br>
is not routed via the connection controllers GW1, GW2, GW3, it<br>
being possible however to provide known network nodes such as<br>
routers, switches, bridges and firewalls., in the transmission<br>
path of the direct connections SIGD, ND for packet-oriented<br>
transmission if they do not carry out any kind of voice<br>
conversions or other time-consuming processing operations of<br>
data packets of the connections SIGD, ND. The direct<br>
connection is established in this case with the aid of the<br>
first IP address IP1 transferred to the second terminal EG2,<br>
network address conversions between various sub-networks being<br>
ignored in the present exemplary embodiment. The direct<br>
connection may also be established by depending on or using<br>
known DMC method steps for direct media communication.<br>
The established connections SIGD, ND are maintained for<br>
subsequent, rapid switching-through of the communication<br>
between the second terminal EG2 and the first terminal EG1<br>
after the call has been accepted by the second terminal EG2.<br>
Time-consuming connection establishment steps, such as the<br>
exchange of codes and/or certificates for secured, subsequent<br>
communication, are carried out as early as when the signaling<br>
connection SIGD and the direct payload connection ND are<br>
established. The first terminal EG1 is actively involved in<br>
the direct establishment of the signaling connection SIGD and<br>
payload connection ND, data transmission via the connections<br>
SIG and Nl already established not being affected thereby.<br>
Maintenance packets IDLE conforming to protocol will be<br>
transmitted hereinafter between the called second terminal EG2<br>
and the calling terminal EG1 via the direct payload connection<br>
ND, so the direct payload connection ND, despite apparent<br>
inactivity, is not automatically cleared but is maintained.<br>
The calling first: terminal EG1 is accordingly configured in<br>
such a way that, while it manages the payload connection Nl it<br>
analyses incoming data packets via the direct payload<br>
connection ND. The incoming data packets are analyzed in this<br>
connection such that the first terminal EG1, with the aid of<br>
the incoming packets, recognizes whether the incoming data<br>
packets are still maintenance packets IDLE for call clearing<br>
suppression or are already valid payload packets following a<br>
call-accepted signal by the second terminal EG2.<br>
Reception of maintenance packets IDLE in the first terminal<br>
EG1 means that the received maintenance-packets IDLE are<br>
ignored and/or maintenance packets IDLE are also transmitted<br>
via the direct payload connection ND to the called terminal<br>
EG2. A call-accepted signal by the called terminal EG2 would,<br>
moreover, be recognized at the first calling terminal EG1 by a<br>
data packet, which differs from a maintenance message or a<br>
maintenance packet IDLE, arriving via the direct payload<br>
connection ND, This is described in more detail hereinafter<br>
with reference to Fig. 1C.<br>
Lifting of the telephone receiver of the second terminal EG2,<br>
indicated in Fig. 1C, causes acceptance of the call by the<br>
second terminal EG2. As a direct result of this call-accepted<br>
signal at the second terminal EG2 the communication pending at<br>
the microphone of the telephone receiver of the second<br>
terminal EG2 is processed in the second terminal EG2. Without<br>
explicit signaling via one of the signaling connections SIG or<br>
SIGD - wherein explicit signaling of the call-accepted signals<br>
by means of SIG and/or SIGD may also be provided in<br>
alternative embodiments to communicate the call-accepted<br>
signal of the second terminal EG2 even if the microphone of<br>
the first terminal EG1 is muted, or to ensure correct<br>
detection for determining call charges - the incoming<br>
communication is digitized by the second terminal EG2 and<br>
transmitted via the direct payload connection ND to the<br>
calling first terminal EGl, with transmission of maintenance<br>
packets IDLE to the second terminal EG2 being terminated. The<br>
arrival of a payload packet of this type, which differs from<br>
maintenance packets IDLE, at the calling first terminal EGl<br>
means that the call-accepted signal of the second terminal is<br>
recognized by the first. This call-accepted signal Is,<br>
moreover, implicitly accepted, i.e. without transmission of an<br>
acknowledgement or confirmation, by the first terminal EGl in<br>
that the payload incoming via the direct- payload connection ND<br>
is processed immediately - without any further signaling -,<br>
and is output via the associated telephone receiver of the<br>
first terminal EGl. The payload connection Nl between the<br>
calling terminal EGl and the second connection controller GW2<br>
is furthermore switched so as to be inactive in that no<br>
further packets that differ from maintenance packets IDLE are<br>
transmitted by the calling terminal EGl via this connection.<br>
Sounds and/or speech received via the telephone receiver of<br>
the first terminal EGl are no longer transmitted via the<br>
payload connection Nl from this point in time either but via<br>
the direct payload connection ND, without additional signaling<br>
having been carried out. Payload packets entering via the<br>
payload connection Nl are rejected by the first terminal EGl.<br>
Rapid switching-through of a communication is thus possible<br>
via a direct payload connection ND. A loss of payload packets<br>
or a communication at a telephone receiver can thus be<br>
avoided. This is particularly advantageous if the second<br>
terminal EG2 is a device for automatic announcements or is a<br>
fax machine or modem. The latter devices conventionally have<br>
the property of transmitting payloads very quickly after<br>
signaled call acceptance, so logs of these payloads would have<br>
an adverse effect. In particular the loss of fax or modem<br>
payloads could prevent connection establishment or make it<br>
impossible. This may be prevented by the, presented method<br>
because directly after the call-accepted signal the pending<br>
communication is transmitted without losses and without delay<br>
to the calling terminal EG1.<br>
The existing payload connections Nl and N2 and the signaling<br>
connections SIG which run via the connection controllers GW1,<br>
GW2, GW3, can continue to be maintained or alternatively (not<br>
shown) be cleared within the framework -of further signaling<br>
messages. If these connections are not cleared it is provided<br>
in the case of both terminals EG1 and EG2 that packets<br>
entering via these connections are ignored.<br>
The terminals EG1, EG2 shown in Fig. 1 and the illustrated<br>
communications system structure should be regarded merely as<br>
examples in this connection. A generalization compared with<br>
any desired terminals and any desired topology as well as any<br>
desired communications protocol is easily possible without<br>
limiting the disclosure of the invention.<br>
Fig. 2 will hereinafter describe a respective state<br>
transmission diagram for the calling terminal EG1 and the<br>
called terminal EG2 according to the method steps illustrated<br>
with reference to Fig. 1. The state transitions are described,<br>
with reference to their course over time, jointly for the<br>
calling and the called terminal EG1, EG2, respective state<br>
transition diagrams being shown separately from each other for<br>
the calling terminal EG1 in Fig. 2A and for the called<br>
terminal EG2 in Fig. 2B. The starting situation for the<br>
calling terminal EG1 is a rest state 0EG1 and likewise a rest<br>
state 0EG1 for the called terminal EG2.<br>
Triggered by dialing of the call number RUNO2 at the first<br>
terminal EG1, the first terminal EG1 changes into an<br>
initialization state for the connection to be established<br>
(state 1EG1) . Triggered as a result, a signaling message Ml is<br>
transmitted to the called terminal EG2 . The transmission takes<br>
place in particular via a plurality of connection controllers,<br>
with these not being shown in Fig. 2. Receipt of the signaling<br>
message Ml causes the called terminal EG2 to leave its rest<br>
state and to change into the state 1EG2 in which steps are<br>
carried out which are executed in the case of an incoming<br>
connection request. In state 2EG2 the called terminal EG2<br>
transmits a response belonging to message Ml via the same<br>
signaling path with the aid of signaling message M2. The<br>
calling terminal EG1 then changes its state to the state 2EGi<br>
which establishes a payload connection to a connection<br>
controller involved in message traffic. The called terminal<br>
EG2 passes immediately from state 2EG2 to state 3EG2 in that an<br>
additional direct signaling and payload connection is<br>
established. For this purpose a signaling message M3 is<br>
transmitted to the calling terminal EG1 and first packets via<br>
the direct payload connection (hereinafter designated "ND"<br>
according to the designation in Fig. 1).<br>
In a modification of the method the first terminal EG1 could<br>
also initiate the direct payload connection ND. This is<br>
especially possible if an IP address of the second terminal<br>
EG2 is transmitted as a parameter of the signaling message M2.<br>
Triggered by reception of this signaling message M3, the<br>
calling terminal EG1 changes its state (new state 3EG1) and<br>
accepts the incoming direct connections - the direct signaling<br>
connection SIGD and the direct payload connection ND - from<br>
the called terminal EG2. The calling terminal EG1 also<br>
immediately changes to state 4Eca in which incoming packets,<br>
which arrive via the direct payload connection ND at the<br>
calling terminal EG1, are analyzed. The called terminal EG2<br>
changes owing to timer expiry from the state 3EG2 to the state<br>
4EG2 and in this state sends a maintenance packet as a payload<br>
packet PIDLE with only "dummy" content to the calling terminal<br>
EG1 via the direct payload connection ND.<br>
In the still active state 4Eci the calling terminal EG1<br>
analyses this incoming payload packet. If it is a maintenance<br>
packet the calling terminal EG1 changes to state 5EG1 and as a<br>
result causes the direct payload connection ND to continue not<br>
to be activated, and instead maintenance payload packets PIDLE<br>
are transmitted via the direct payload connection ND, starting<br>
from the calling terminal EG1. With renewed timer expiry at<br>
the called terminal EG2 this procedure is repeated again, so a<br>
maintenance payload packet PIDLE is transmitted again to the<br>
calling terminal EG1 and is analyzed therein analogously to<br>
the above-mentioned steps. This process is repeated until<br>
either the calling terminal EG1 terminates its call set-up<br>
request, until there is a call-accepted signal at the called<br>
terminal EG2 - in particular by lifting of a telephone<br>
receiver - or until one of the connection contx'ollers involved<br>
initiates termination of the connection.<br>
Triggered by a call-accepted signal of this type, the called<br>
terminal EG2 changes from the state 4EG2 to state 5EG2 - In this<br>
state pending communication data is converted directly into<br>
payload and transmitted via the direct payload connection ND<br>
to the calling terminal EG1 by means of filled payload packets<br>
PNUTZ • Sending of: filled payload packets PNUTZ is continued until<br>
the call is terminated in a known manner - for example by<br>
replacing the receiver. Before arrival of the first filled<br>
payload packet Ptnnz the calling terminal ,EG1 is still in the<br>
state 4EG1 in which incoming payload packets are analyzed via<br>
the direct payload connection ND. If a filled payload packet<br>
PNUTZ accordingly reaches the calling terminal EG1, this<br>
recognizes the receipt of a valid payload packet PNUTZ that<br>
describes a call-accepted signal and changes to state 6EG1 in<br>
which the connection, and therefore the communication to be<br>
transmitted, is switched through to the input/output device<br>
(i.e. the telephone receiver) of the calling device EG1. In<br>
this state the calling terminal EG1 processes incoming payload<br>
packets PNUTZ which arrive via the direct payload connection ND<br>
and sends its own payload packets to the called terminal EG2<br>
via this direct payload connection ND.<br>
Both terminals EG1, EG2 can therefore change over into a<br>
connected state - states 7EG1 or 6EG2 - in which a payload<br>
stream NDS of payload packets is exchanged via the direct<br>
payload connection ND. Further steps, such as execution of<br>
specific features or, subsequently, call clearing, are<br>
accordingly possible. These steps are not described in more<br>
detail in the illustrated figures 2A and 2B, however.<br>
The states shown in Fig. 2 illustrate a largely simplified<br>
depiction of a connection establishment according to the<br>
invention. For example communication between a connection<br>
controller and the first terminal EG1 has been omitted for<br>
reasons of clarity. Observation of this connection would<br>
therefore have led to payload packets arriving at the first<br>
terminal EG1 being rejected by a connection controller in<br>
state SEGI - In states 2EG1 to 5EG1 on the other hand incoming<br>
payload packets would be processed by a connection controller<br>
via the first terminal EG1.<br>
The method steps shown with reference to figures 1 and 2 are<br>
advantageous insofar as the method allows rapid and loss-free<br>
changeover between an existing payload connection and an<br>
already established, but not yet active payload connection.<br>
This is particularly advantageous if, owing to time-consuming<br>
and complex call set-up methods a connection establishment of<br>
a payload connection is completed comparatively slowly, so<br>
without employing the invention recommended maximum switchthrough<br>
delays - for example 250 ms maximum delay -<br>
recommended by the ITU-T, cannot be observed.<br>
It is also advantageous that integration in existing<br>
implementations of protocols and transmission methods is<br>
easily possible since only minor modifications are necessary.<br>
Known methods may also be used for signaling and the payload<br>
connection. These are, in particular, method steps according<br>
to H.323, SIP, a transmission of payload packets according to<br>
RTF (Real-time Transport Protocol) and/or other standards or<br>
implementations. The method can advantageously be applied to<br>
all IP-based communications systems which are provided for<br>
real-time-critical transmission of flows of media - for<br>
example within the framework of Voice-over-IP or Multimediaover-<br>
IP. Although in the present exemplary embodiment only<br>
packet-based connections are used, individual signaling<br>
portions between the connection controllers for example can<br>
also be carried out by line-based communication segments.<br><br><br><br>
