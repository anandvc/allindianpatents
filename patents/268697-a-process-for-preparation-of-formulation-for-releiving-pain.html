2.	PREMABLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
PROVISIONAL<br><br>
The following specification describes the invention.	þ     COMPLETE<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparation of formulation for relieving pain. In the present invention, a natural medication for relieving pain is prepared by mixing cow’s urine, cow dung, stem, latex, flower, leaves and ksara of Calotropis plant, powder of curcuma longa (turmeric) and edible lime paste. These ingredients are mixed in various proportions and processed at various steps, to form the medication.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A major amount of analgesics are known in the world; viz. opioid analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS). The major examples of analgesics available in the market are NSAIDS i.e. salicylic acid, aspirin, methyl salicylate, acetaminophen, indomethacin, diclofenac, ibuprofen and opioid analgesics i.e. enkephalins, endorphins and dynorphins. These drugs are chemical moieties synthesized artificially and cause many side effects and adverse effects like gastric ulceration, platelet inhibition, impaired renal functions and hypersensitivity reactions.<br>
	There is a serious need for any product which shows less side or adverse reactions. The best way to overcome the problem lies within herbal products. The herbal products are those prepared using plant products and not chemically synthesized. These products have least or no pronounced side effects, as compared to chemical moieties and these are relatively safe.<br>
Chinese application number 200610165708 discloses a medicament for treating rheumatism and rheumatoid arthritis which contains use of turmeric along with a number of other natural herbs and plants. Although the formulation is useful in arthritis; it is very complex to make as it contains lots of ingredients.<br>
Chinese patent application number 200710012234 discloses a traditional chinese medicine for treating rheumatoid arthritis and bone ache which contains use of angelica, chuanxiong rhizome, safflower, anomalous wormwood, turmeric, fructus liquidambaris, Rhizomza Seu Radix Notopterygii, dahurian angelica root, chinese clematis, mulberry twigs, arisaema with bile, sinapis alba, spatholobus stem. The formulation has a complex use of large amount of ingredients which makes the process to prepare the formulation quiet confusing and lengthy.<br>
US patent application number 2004/0037903 discloses a formulation for relief of pain resulting from inflammation using resveratrol and turmeric extract. The formulation may also include stinging nettle, and Boswellia serrata. The formulation is useful only for pain caused due to inflammation. Thus other pains like back ache, body ache, tennis elbow, spondolytis, etc are not treated by this formulation. Thus, there is a need for a formulation providing pain relief.<br>
The present formulation contains Calotropis plant, turmeric powder, edible lime, cow urine (go-mutra) and cow dung. Thus, decreasing the complexity presented by the prior art and providing quite easy and short process to prepare the formulation. Therefore, it satisfies need for a less complicated and effective formulation for pain relief, that works on various forms of pains and body aches.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The main object of the invention is to provide a process for preparation of formulation for relieving pain. <br>
Another object of this invention is to provide an organic, non-toxic and herbal preparation for relieving pain.<br>
 Further object of the present invention is for almost permanent removal of pain with no recurrence.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
	The present invention discloses a process for preparing a medication for the almost permanent cure of pain in humans. A process for producing this medication comprises, mixing cow’s urine and cow dung in fixed proportions and preparing solution; soaking of Calotropis plant species, grinding, preparing solution followed by mixing with previously prepared cow’s urine and cow’s dung solution in a fixed proportion and finally mixing this previously prepared solution mix with the solution prepared from edible lime paste and turmeric powder.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:<br>
	The nature of the invention and the manner in which it is performed is clearly described in the specification. The invention has various components and they are clearly described in the following pages of the complete specification.<br>
	In the present invention cow’s urine; cow dung; stem, latex, flowers, leaves, and ksara of Calotropis plant species; powder of curcuma longa (turmeric) and lime paste are used.<br>
Calotropis is a genus of flowering plants in the family, Apocynaceae, that is native to North Africa, Tropical Africa, Western Asia, South Asia, and Indochina.  The green globes are hollow but the flesh contains a toxic milky sap that is extremely bitter and turns into gluey coating resistant to soap. The root skin, stem, latex, flowers, leaves and the ksara are used for medicinal purpose.<br>
Curcuma longa (turmeric) is a rhizomatous herbaceous perennial plant of the ginger family, Zingiberaceae. It is native to tropical South Asia and needs temperatures between 20°C and 30°C. Its active ingredient is curcumin and it has a distinctly earthy, slightly bitter, slightly hot peppery flavor and a mustardy smell. In Ayurvedic practices, turmeric has many medicinal properties and many in South Asia is used it as a readily available antiseptic for cuts, burns and bruises. It is also used as an antibacterial agent. <br>
Ayurvedic medicine commonly uses the urine and dung of animals as ingredients. Cow's urine is the most generally used and considered a most potent medicine. Cow's urine "gomutra" is prescribed as an ingredient of various plasters and mixtures (sometimes with fermented wine) or alone, as an antidote for obesity, as a purgative; for eliminating vermin from an ulcer; vayu disorders, abdominal dropsy and many other uses. Bitumen and cow's urine is taken internally to cure malignant jaundice. Antimony sulfide and cow's urine taken internally is also used to cure malignant jaundice. For the case of sebaceous cysts (large swellings that exude a fatty liquid on bursting), incision followed by washing with cow's urine is prescribed. Another treatment is the surgical incision and the removal of fat followed by cauterization of the wound.<br>
In the present invention 750-1500 ml cow’s urine, 50-200 gm of cow dung, 750-1000 gm stem, latex, flowers, leaves and ksara of Calotropis plant species, 500-250 gm curcuma longa (turmeric) powder and lime paste in quantity sufficient amount are used. <br>
The process for preparation of the medicine comprises of the following steps:<br>
Step-1: Preparation of Solution A<br>
(a)	Cow’s urine is mixed with cow dung.<br>
(b)	This is filtered using a fine gauze cotton cloth.<br>
(c)	The filtrate is then distilled using the standard distillation process.<br>
Step-2: Preparation of Paste B <br>
(d)	Latex, stem, flowers, leaves and ksara of Calotropis plant species are collected and soaked in solution A and it is ground in a paste using any grinding mechanism.<br>
Step-3: Preparation of Paste C<br>
(e)	Powder of Curcuma longa (turmeric) is mixed with 5-25 gm of edible lime paste, in a glass container and then solution A is added to make it semi liquid paste. <br>
Step-4: Preparation of final product <br>
Lastly paste B is mixed with paste C. The container is then heated slowly on a gas burner till it becomes thick slurry. It is then allowed to cool gradually in a natural environment. It is thoroughly stirred and the medicine is ready.<br>
	The paste prepared by using above stated method is applied on the body area using brush and then it is covered by cotton gauge and then with plastic or polythene and after that warming (using head pad) or fomentation is applied on the outer part of plastic or polythene for 20-25 min.<br>
	The preset formulation is used for treatment of chronic back ache (Lumbar Spondylosis), frozen shoulder, osteoarthritis of knee, cervical Spondylosis, chronic sprain of ankle, chronic tendoachilis and tennis elbow.<br>
	The invention is illustrated more in detail in the following example. The example describes and demonstrates embodiments within the scope of the present invention. This example is given solely for the purpose of illustration and is not to be construed as limitations of the present invention, as many variations thereof are possible without departing from the spirit and scope.<br>
