PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF IRBESARTAN HYDROCHLORIDE"<br>
CIPLA LIMITED, of 289 Bellasis Road, Mumbai Central, Mumbai - 400 008, India.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
WO 2006/046043<br><br>
PCT/GB2005/004151<br><br>
PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF IRBESARTAN<br>
HYDROCHLORIDE<br>
The present invention is concerned with a process for the preparation of   2n-butyl-4-spkocyclopentane-l-[(2'-(tetrazol-5-yl)biphenyl-4-yl)methyl]-2-irnidazolin-5-one hydrochloride,  irbesartan hydrochloride, novel  crystalline forms  thereof,  formulations containing the same, therapeutic uses thereof and methods of treatment employing the same.<br>
Irbesartan, 2n-butyl-4-spirocyclopentane-l-[(2'-(tetrazol-5yl)biphenyl-4-yl)methyl]-2-imidazolin-5 one, can be represented by the following structural formula<br><br>
Irbesartan is a non-peptide angiotensin-II antagonist. Irbesartan inhibits the action of angiotensin - II on its receptor and thus prevents the increase in b100d pressure produced by the hormone - receptor interaction. Irbesartan is, therefore, employed in the treatment of cardiovascular complaints, such as hypertension and heart failure.<br>
US Patent 5,270,317 discloses certain N-substituted heterocyclic derivatives, including 2n-butyl-4-spirocyclopentane-1 -[(2'-(tetrazol-5yl)biphenyl-4-yl)methyl]-2-imidazolin-5 one, and methods of making and using the same.<br><br>
WO 2006/046043<br><br>
PCT/GB2005/004151<br><br>
US Patent 5,629,331 discloses two polymorphic forms, Form A and Form B, of 2n-butyl-4-spirocyclopentane-l-[(2'-(tetrazol-5yl)biphenyl-4-yl)methyl]-2-imidazolin-5 one, a process for the preparation thereof and uses of the same for the treatment of hypertension.<br>
WO 99/67236 discloses a new crystalline habit of Form A of 2n-butyl-4-spirocyclopentane-l-[(2'-(tetrazol-5yl)biphenyl-4-yl)methyl3-2-imidazolin-5 one, a process for the preparation thereof and composition containing the same.<br>
WO 03/050110Ai discloses preparation of amorphous 2n-butyl-4-spirocyclopentane-l-[(2'-(tetrazol-5yl)biphenyl-4-yl)methyl]-2-imidazolin-5 one from Form A and Form B.<br>
WO 04/007482A2 discloses a two phase preparation of irbesartan using a phase transfer catalyst at me trityl irbesartan stage.<br>
WO 04/072064A1 discloses a number of processes for preparing irb-Tr, including reaction of the following starting materials in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst, an inorganic base and a solvent.<br><br><br>
N=N Rs.N-CPh,<br><br>
The   WO2004/072064   process   involves   isolation  of irb-Tr   (by   separation,   column chromatography and, optionally, distillation), before conversion to irbesartan.<br>
There is, however, a need for an improved process for the preparation of irbesartan for the following reasons.<br>
The synthesis of irbesartan as discussed in US Patent 5,270,317, US Patent 5,559,233 and EP 045451 IB involves a pre-penultimate reaction step (excluding workup and purification)<br><br>
WO 2006/046043<br><br>
PCT/GB2005/004151<br><br>
which comprises reaction of a cyano group on the biphenyl ring with an azide, for example, tributyl tin azide. Reaction times as long as 210 hours are required, see line 5, column 20 of US Patent 5,270,317 and it is recognized in the art that there are safety risks associated with the use of azides.<br>
US Patent 5,629,331 also discloses the reaction of an azide with a cyano group as above, the process being carried out in the presence of a dipolar aprotic solvent, for example, methyl pyrrolidone, which is relatively high boiling and can be difficult to remove. US Patent 5,629,331 acknowledges safety risks involved in use of azides at high temperature (see column 4, line 39).<br>
WO Patent 04/007482A2 discloses the preparation of irbesartan using trityl irbesartan in a two phase reaction. Trityl irbesartan is first prepared, isolated in residue form and then detritylated in an acetone - HC1 mixture, further basified, filtered with tritanol and reacidified to isolate irbesartan. The isolation of crude irbesartan involves basification, reacidification, toluene distillation and isolation, making the process tedious and unsuitable for use on an industrial scale.<br>
Furthermore, formulation of irbesartan prepared by the above-described prior art processes has required much care because the resulting irbesartan powder tends to stick to the walls of equipment, for example, to the sides of the punches or to the mixer walls, due to its high electrostaticity. There is, therefore, a need for an improved process for the preparation of irbesartan, in particular a process that can provide irbesartan which is non-static, has free flowing properties, shorter reaction time and workup operations, and involves a simplified finishing operation which will enhance productivity and better intrinsic dissolution. This is now essentially achieved by a one-pot process according to the present invention, which results in irbesartan hydrochloride which has excellent flow properties.<br>
According to the present invention, therefore, there is provided a one-pot process for the preparation of irbesartan hydrochloride of formula (I)<br><br>

which one-pot process comprises reacting intermediate compounds 2n-butyl-l,3-diazaspiro [4,4] non-l-en-4-one of formula (IT), optionally in salt form, preferably hydrochloride, and 5-(4'-bromomethyl-biphenyl-2-yl)-l-trityl l-lH-tetrazole of formula (III)<br><br><br><br><br><br>

where Hal represents bromo, chloro, fluoro or iodo, preferably bromo.    Intermediate compounds of formulae (II) and (III) are known in the art.<br>
Reaction of intermediate compounds of formulae (II) and (III) results in formation of intermediate compound 2n-butyl-3-[2'(triphenyl methyl tetrazol-5yl)-biphenyl-4-yl-methyl]-' 1,3-diazaspiro [4,4] non-l-en-4-one of formula (IV) shown below, optionally in salt form, preferably hydrochloride, which is subsequently detritylated to yield irbesartan hydrochloride of formula (I)<br><br>

A one-pot process for the preparation of irbesartan hydrochloride according to the present invention can thus be represented by the following reaction scheme<br><br>
WO 2006/046043<br><br>
PCT/GB2005/004151<br><br>

where Hal represents bromo, chloro, fluoro or iodo, preferably bromo, and each of intermediate compounds (II) and (IV) can optionally be present in salt form, preferably the hydrochloride.<br><br>
WO 2006/046043<br><br>
PCT/GB2005/004151<br><br>
A one-pot process according to the present invention can provide irbesartan hydrochloride in crystalline hydrated or anhydrous form, or in amorphous form, with high purity and yield, and which is free flowing, non-sticky and non-electrostatic. Preferably a one-pot process according to the present invention provides irbesartan hydrochloride as the sesquihydrate, hemihydrate, anhydrous or amorphous form, and also the process can be used for preparation of irbesartan free base either as Form A or Form B.<br>
Typically an intermediate compound of formula (II) is employed in salt form, preferably the hydrochloride.<br>
A one-pot process according to the present invention is preferably carried out in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst in a reaction system optionally comprising first and second phases, and also in the presence of an inorganic base. Detritylation is preferably achieved by using a mineral acid.<br>
Use of phase transfer catalysts for a similar type of reaction has previously been described for preparation of angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan.   Phase transfer catalysts are of particular utility when at least first and second reactants have such different solubility characteristics that there is no practical common solvent 'therefor and accordingly combining a solvent for one with a solvent for the other results in a two phase system. Several classes of compounds are known to be capable of acting as phase transfer catalysts, for example, quaternary ammonium compounds, quaternary phosphonium compounds, crown ethers or the like.<br>
A process according to the present invention preferably employs an aromatic or aliphatic hydrocarbon as a solvent of the one-pot reaction system, with a preferred solvent being an aromatic hydrocarbon, such as benzene, toluene, o-xylene, m-xylene, or the like. Toluene is a particularly preferred such aromatic hydrocarbon for use in accordance with the present invention. Aliphatic ketones, such as acetone and MIBK, may also be used as the solvent of the reaction system. Other hydrocarbons useful in the practice of the present invention will be apparent to the skilled artisan.<br><br>
WO 2006/046043<br><br>
PCT/GB2005/004151<br><br>
The solvent employed in a one-pot reaction system in a process according to the present invention can consist essentially of a hydrocarbon solvent substantially as described above. Alternatively, it may be preferred that the reaction system comprises first and second solvent phases. Suitably, the first solvent phase comprises a hydrocarbon solvent substantially as described above, and the solvent of the second solvent phase is substantially immiscible therewith. Typically, the solvent of the second solvent phase comprises water, which can be used alone, or more preferably an inorganic base can be combined therewith.<br>
An inorganic base used in a reaction system according to the present invention can be selected from the group consisting of hydroxides, carbonates or alkoxides of alkali metals, such as for example KOH, NaOH, LiOH, K2CO3, Na2C03, CS2CO3, sodium methoxide, sodium t-butoxide, potassium t-butoxide and the like. An inorganic base for use in accordance with the present invention can be combined with water as the solvent of the second phase of the reaction system as described above or can be used as such in powdered form. The preferred base for use in a one-pot reaction according to the present invention is NaOH, potassium-t-butoxide or sodium-t-butoxide.<br>
A synthetic one-pot process as provided by the present invention preferably involves the preparation of 2n-butyl-3-[2'(triphenyl methyl tetrazol-5yl)-biphenyl-4-yl-methyl]-l,3-diazaspiro [4,4] non-l-en-4-one hydrochloride of formula (IV) as shown above by the reaction of 5-(4'-bromomethyl biphenyl-2-yl)-l-tri1yl-lH-tetrazole of formula (III) and 2n-butyl-l,3-diazaspiro [4,4]-nori-l-en-4-one of formula (II) as the HC1 in presence of a base, with a phase transfer catalyst, in the presence of a hydrocarbon solvent, preferably toluene, optionally in presence of water as a second phase of the one-pot reaction system. The condensation of intermediate compounds of formulae (II) and (EI) is preferably carried out at a temperature from about 20°C to about 95°C, preferably at about 85°C. The reaction is allowed to proceed for a time that the skilled artisan will know to adjust according to the reaction temperature. For example, when the reaction temperature is about 90°C, a reaction time of between about 1 and 2 hours is usually sufficient. The reaction can be easily monitored using Thin Layer Chromatography. After reaction completion, the reaction is cooled to about 25°C and the aqueous layer, if present, is separated, the reaction mass is washed with water and the layers are separated. A suitable acid, such as HC1 (4N) is added to<br><br>
WO 2006/046043<br><br>
PCT/GB2005/004151<br><br>
the reaction mass and stirred at about 55°C for 40 minutes to 1 hour. The reaction can again be easily monitored by Thin Layer Chromatography and after reaction completion, the product can be filtered. Upon filtration, the product is washed with water and dried to yield irbesartan hydrochloride m hydrated form.<br>
Optionally, the irbesartan hydrochloride according to the present invention can be purified further by dissolving in a solvent, such as methanol, at elevated temperatures and precipitated with a non-solvent, such as ethyl acetate. Irbesartan hydrochloride according to the present invention may also be purified by suspending in a solvent, such as ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate or ethyl acetate-methanol mixture, at elevated temperatures and filtering the suspension at room temperature. The water of hydration is retained by the irbesartan hydrochloride in the above described processes of purification.<br>
A process according, to the present invention may further optionally comprise converting irbesartan hydrochloride prepared thereby to irbesartan free base, either Form A or Form B. Suitably the process can thus further comprise addition of a base, such as aqueous ammonia, to adjust the pH to about 6 to 7, followed by isolation of irbesartan free base either as Form A or Form B, The present invention further provides irbesartan free base, either Form A or Form B, prepared from a process as described herein.<br>
In a one-pot process according to the present invention, isolation of trityl irbesartan is avoided and tedious work-up procedures such as distillation, basifying the reaction mass, and acidifying, as mentioned in Patent WO 04/007482, are not involved. In accordance with an especially advantageous embodiment of the invention, the two steps of coupling and hydrolysis are done using the same solvent and as such there is no replacing of one solvent with another. The above feature of the present invention eliminates the tedious process of distillation and thus avoids formation of impurities that are a feature of prior art processes. In another embodiment of the present invention, tritanol, which is a by-product of the reaction, is dissolved in toluene after detritylation and hence irbesartan can be directly filtered in a pure hydrochloride form. The present invention thus avoids filtration of tritanol and the whole process is completed in a single pot, without the need to isolate trityl irbesartan.<br><br>
WO 2006/046043<br><br>
PCT/GB2005/004151<br><br>
11<br>
Thus, advantageously, the step of forming the trityl irbesartan and the steps of converting the trityl irbesartan to irbesartan is carried out in the same solvent or solvents. Advantageously, the step of converting the irbesartan to irbesartan hydrochloride is carried out in the same solvent or, solvents as the earlier step(s).<br>
Moreover, in this one-pot reaction the total time required to isolate irbesartan is about 8-10 hours, compared to the prior art processes that require a much longer time thus leading to a huge gain in productivity in accordance with the present invention. Hydrated irbesartan hydrochloride or anhydrous irbesartan hydrochloride obtained by the present invention is free flowing, less electrostatic, non-sticky, non-hygroscopic, has better intrinsic dissolution and is obtained in increased yield and purity.<br>
According to the present invention, there is further provided crystalline hydrated and anhydrous irbesartan hydrochloride, which is substantially non-hygroscopic and has good flow characteristics as referred to above. There is further provided by the present invention crystalline irbesartan hydrochloride in hydrated form or anhydrous form as prepared by a process according to the present invention. Hydrates of irbesartan hydrochloride according to the present invention have a moisture content ranging from 1% to about 10% by weight and the anhydrous form of irbesartan hydrochloride has a moisture content ranging from 0.1 to 1.0% by weight. The present invention further provides irbesartan hydrochloride in amorphous form.<br>
Specifically, therefore, the present invention discloses the amorphous, anhydrous, hemihydrate and sesquihydrate forms of irbesartan hydrochloride.<br>
There is provided by the present invention, therefore, crystalline irbesartan hydrochloride sesquihydrate having an TR pattern, or substantially the same IR pattern, as shown in Figure 2. More particularly, irbesartan hydrochloride sesquihydrate has characteristic IR absorbance at about 3638, 3273, 2451, 1761, 1639, 1514, 1477, 1323 and 1302 cm"1.<br>
Crystalline irbesartan hydrochloride sesquihydrate according to the present invention is further characterised by having a water content from about 5.7% to 7.5%.<br><br>
WO 2006/046043	PCT/GB2005/004151<br>
Crystalline irbesartan hydrochloride sesquihydiate according to the present invention is further characterised as having an X-ray powder diagram, or substantially the same X-ray powder diagram, as shown in Figure 1. Crystalline irbesartan hydrochloride sesquihydrate according to the present invention is further characterised as having characteristic peaks (29): 7.49, 8.24, 11.01, 14.92, 15.32, 16.28, 17.38, 22.52, 22.98, 23.42, 24.68, 26.57, 27.00 and 28.47°.<br>
