				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to disposable absorbent articles such as disposable diapers and other<br>
articles intended for use on incontinent persons.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Disposable absorbent articles are designed to absorb and contain bodily waste in order to<br>
prevent soiling of the body and clothing of the wearer, as well as bedding or other objects with<br>
which the wearer comes into contact<br>
As the usage of disposable absorbent articles has expanded, their complexity has increased<br>
with the incorporation of additional features serving to enhance their performance and<br>
appearance. The costs of the materials and the costs of the manufacturing processes have also<br>
increased in conjunction with the increase in complexity. As a result, the prices at which these<br>
articles are sold have risen to levels that many potential purchasers around the world cannot afford<br>
to pay. Thus, a need exists for a simple disposable absorbent article.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a simple disposable absorbent article including a chassis and<br>
an absorbent assembly. The chassis includes a water-impermeable sheet that may be folded<br>
laterally inward at both of its side edges to form opposing side flaps. Each side flap is attached to<br>
the interior surface of the chassis adjacent to its end edges. Each side flap has a longitudinally<br>
extending elastic gathering member attached adjacent to its proximal edge. The absorbent<br>
assembly is smaller in width and in length than the chassis. The side edges and end edges of the<br>
absorbent assembly may be disposed proximally relative to the respective -side edges and end<br>
edges of the chassis. The absorbent assembly includes an absorbent core. The absorbent core<br>
may contain superabsorbent particles and these particles may be contained inside pockets. The<br>
chassis may include an extensible formed web material. The absorbent assembly may be attached<br>
in a cruciform pattern to the chassis to allow portions of the chassis to extend laterally.<br>

In this description, the following terms have the following meanings:<br>
The term "absorbent article" refers to a device that absorbs and contains liquid, and more<br>
specifically, refers to a device that is placed against or in proximity to the body of the wearer to<br>
absorb and contain the various exudates discharged from the body.<br>
The term "diaper" refers to an absorbent article that is generally worn by infants and<br>
incontinent persons about the lower torso so as to encircle the waist and the legs of the wearer and<br>
that is specifically adapted to receive and contain urinary and fecal waste.<br>
The term "disposable" refers to the nature of absorbent articles that generally are not<br>
intended to be laundered or otherwise restored or reused as an absorbent article, i.e., they are<br>
intended to be discarded after a single use and, preferably, to be recycled, composted or otherwise<br>
disposed of in an environmentally compatible manner.<br>
The term "longitudinal" refers to a direction running from a waist edge to an opposing waist<br>
edge of the article and generally parallel to the rnaxirnum linear dimension of the article.<br>
Directions within ±45° of the longitudinal direction are considered to be "longitudinal".<br>
The term "lateral" refers to a direction running from a side edge to an opposing side edge of<br>
the article and generally at a right angle to the longitudinal direction. Directions wirain ±45° of<br>
the lateral direction are considered to be "lateral".<br>
The term "disposed" refers to an element being attached and positioned in a particular place<br>
or position in a unitary structure with other elements.<br>
The term "attached" refers to elements being connected or united by fastening, adhering,<br>
bonding, etc. by any method suitable for the elements being attached together and uieir<br>
constituent materials. Many suitable methods for attaching elements together are well-known,<br>
including adhesive bonding, pressure bonding, thermal bonding, mechanical fastening, etc. Such<br>
attachment methods may be used to attach elements together over a particular area either<br>
continuously or intermittently.<br>
The term "cohesive" refers to the property of a material that sticks to itself but does not to<br>
any significant degree stick to other materials.<br>
The terms "water-permeafcle" and "water-impermeable" refer to the penetrability of<br>
materials in the context of the intended usage of disposable absorbent articles. Specifically, the<br>
term "water-permeable" refers to a layer or a layered structure having pores, openings, and/or<br>
interconnected void spaces that permit liquid water to pass through its thickness in the absence of<br>
a forcing pressure. Conversely, the term "water-impermeable" refers to a layer or a layered<br>
structure through the thickness of which liquid water cannot pass in the absence of a forcing<br>
pressure. A layer or a layered structure that is water-impermeable according to this definition<br>
may be permeable to water vapor, i.e., may be "vapor-permeable". As is well known in the art, a<br>
common method for measuring the permeability to water of the materials typically used in<br>
absorbent articles is a hydrostatic pressure test, also called a hydrostatic head test or simply a<br>
"hydrohead" test Suitable well known compendia! methods for hydrohead testing are approved<br>
by INDA (formerly the International Nonwovens and Disposables Association, now The<br>
Association of the Nonwoven Fabrics Industry) and EDANA (European Disposables And<br>
Nonwovens Association).<br>
The terms "proximal" and "distal" refer respectively to the location of an element near to or<br>
far from the center of a structure, e.g., the proximal edge of a longitudinally extending element is<br>
located nearer to the longitudinal axis than the distal edge of the same element is located relative<br>
to the same longitudinal axis.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, and Figure 6, one end<br>
portion of the exemplary diaper 20 is configured as a front waist region 36. The longitudinally<br>
opposing end portion of the diaper 20 is configured as a back waist region 38. An intermediate<br>
portion of the diaper 20 extending longitudinally between the front waist region 36 and the back<br>
waist region 38 is configured as a crotch region 37.<br>
The basic structure of the diaper 20 includes a chassis 100. The chassis 100 has a laterally<br>
extending front waist edge 136 in the front waist region 36 and a longitudinally opposing and<br>
laterally extending back waist edge 138 in the back waist region 38. The chassis 100 has a<br>
longitudinally extending left side edge 137a and a laterally opposing and longitudinally extending<br>
right side edge 137b, bom chassis side edges extending longitudinally between the front waist<br>
edge 136 and the back waist edge 138. The chassis 100 has an interior surface 102 and an<br>
exterior surface 104. The chassis 109 also has a longitudinal axis 42 and a lateral axis 44. The<br>
longitudinal axis 42 extends through the midpoint of the front waist edge 136 and through the<br>
midpoint of the back waist edge 138 of the chassis 100. The lateral axis 44 extends through the<br>
midpoint of the left side edge 137a and through the midpoint of the right side edge 137b of the<br>
chassis 100. The exemplary chassis 100 shown in Figure 1 additionally has longitudinally<br>
extending and laterally opposing side flaps 147a and 147b mat are described in more detail<br>
below.<br>
The basic structure of the diaper 20 also includes an absorbent assembly 200 that is attached<br>
to the chassis 100. The absorbent assembly 200 has a laterally extending front edge 236 in the<br>
front waist region 36 and a longitudinally opposing and laterally extending back edge 238 in the<br>
back waist region 38. The absorbent assembly 200 has a longitudinally extending left side edge<br>
237a and a laterally opposing and longitudinally extending right side edge 237b, both absorbent<br>
assembly side edges extending longitudinally between the front edge 236 and the back edge 238.<br>
The absorbent assembly 200 has an interior surface 202 and an exterior surface 204. The<br>
absorbent assembly 200 may be disposed symmetrically with respect to either or both of the<br>
longitudinal axis 42 and the lateral axis 44. Alternatively, the absorbent assembly 200 may be<br>
disposed asymmetrically with respect to either or both of the longitudinal axis 42 and the lateral<br>
axis 44. For example, the absorbent assembly 200 shown in Figure 1 is disposed symmetrically<br>
with respect to the longitudinal axis 42 and asymmetrically with respect to the lateral axis 44. In<br>
particular, the absorbent assembly 200 shown in Figure 1 is disposed asymmetrically toward the<br>
front waist region 36.<br>
The respective front edge 236, back edge 238, left side edge 237a, and right side edge 237b<br>
of the absorbent assembly 200 may lie inward of the respective front waist edge 136, back waist<br>
edge 138, left side edge 137a, and right side edge 137b of the chassis 100, as in the exemplary<br>
diaper 20 shown in Figure 1. Such a configuration in which one or more of the edges of the<br>
absorbent assembly 200 lies inward of the corresponding edges of the chassis 100 may be<br>
desirable, for example, hi order to allow the relatively more flexible layer or layers adjacent to the<br>
edges of the chassis to conform to the body of the wearer and thereby form effective gasket-like<br>
seals against the skin of the wearer without being constrained by a relatively thicker and relatively<br>
less flexible absorbent assembly. Alternatively, one or more of the edges of the absorbent<br>
assembly 200 may coincide with the corresponding edge or edges of the chassis 100.<br>
As shown in Figure 7, Figure 8, and Figure 9, when the diaper 20 is worn on the lower<br>
torso of a wearer, me front waist edge 136 and the back waist edge 138 encircle the waist of me<br>
wearer, while at the same time the chassis side edges 137a and 137b encircle the legs of the<br>
wearer. At the same time, the crotch region 37 is generally positioned between the legs of the<br>
wearer and the absorbent assembly 206 extends from the front waist region 36 through the crotch<br>
region 37 to the bade waist region 38.<br>
Description of the Chassis<br>
In Figure 10, Figure 11, Figure 12, Fignre 13, Figure 14, and Figure 15, the exemplary<br>
chassis 100 is shown laid out flat before the side flaps 147a and 147b are formed by folding<br>
portions of the chassis 100 laterally inward, i.e., toward the longitudinal axis 42, to form both the<br>
respective side flaps 147a and 147b and the side edges 137a and 137b of the chassis 100 as<br>
shown hi Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, and Figure 6. In this condition of<br>
being laid out flat, the chassis 160 has a longitudinally extending left outer side edge 155a and a<br>
laterally opposing and longitudinally extending right outer side edge 155b. Both of these chassis<br>
outer side edges extend longitudinally between the front waist edge 136 and the back waist edge<br>
138. As is described in more detail below, when the side flaps 147a and 147b are formed by<br>
folding portions of the chassis 180 laterally inward, the outer side edges 155a and 155b of the<br>
chassis form the respective proximal edges 157a and 157b of the side flaps.<br>
The chassis 100 includes a water-impermeable backsheet 26, The backsheet 26 forms an<br>
exterior surface that is intended to be placed toward any clothing mat is worn over the diaper <br>
Many suitable materials for use as the backsheet 26 are well-known, including films of<br>
polyethylene and other polyolefins. Multi-layer backsheets, such as laminates of a film and a<br>
nonwoven, are also well-known and may be suitable for use as the backsheet 26. Such a laminate<br>
backsheet may be oriented with the nonwoven disposed exteriorly to provide the feel and<br>
appearance of a more cloth-like outermost layer than would be provided by using the film as the<br>
outermost layer.<br>
The chassis 100 may, but need not, additionally include an inner liner 22 attached to the<br>
backsheet 26. The inner liner 22 may form a portion of the interior surface 102 of the chassis 100<br>
that is intended to be placed against the body of the wearer. The inner liner 22 preferably is<br>
formed of a soft material that will not irritate the skin of the wearer. Such an inner liner 22 may<br>
serve to isolate the skm of the wearer from a portion of the backsheet 26 as may be desirable, for<br>
example, when the diaper 20 is worn under conditions in which contact between the skin and a<br>
backsheet film could be uncomfortable. Many suitable materials for the inner liner 22 are wellknown<br>
in the art, including rayon and synthetic nonwovens such as spunbonded or carded<br>
polypropylene or polyester. The inner liner 22 may extend to the same width and the same length<br>
as the backsheet 26. For example, hi the exemplary chassis 100 shown hi Figure 10 and Figure<br>
11, the edges of the inner liner 22 are not separately identified because the inner liner 22 has the<br>
same extent as the backsheet 26.<br>
Alternatively, one or more of the edges of the inner liner 22 may lie inward of the edges of<br>
the backsheet 26. For example, with reference to the exemplary diaper 26 shown in Figure 1,<br>
only the portions of the inner liner 22 lying in the gaps between the front edge 236 of the<br>
absorbent assembly 200 and me front waist edge 136 of the chassis 100 and between the back<br>
edge 238 of the absorbent assembly 200 and the back waist edge 138 of the chassis 100 are<br>
exposed, while the remainder of the inner liner 22 is covered by the absorbent assembly 200 and<br>
the side flaps 147a and 147b. Therefore, a laterally extending strip of the inner liner 22 disposed<br>
in me gap in the front waist region 36 and a similar laterally extending strip of the inner liner 22<br>
disposed in the gap in fee back waist region 38 may suffice to isolate the skin of the wearer from<br>
(k the backsheet 26 in these two gaps.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, and Figure 6, the exemplary<br>
chassis 100 has longitudinally extending and laterally opposing side flaps 147a and 147b that are<br>
disposed on the interior portion of the diaper 20 that faces inwardly toward the wearer and<br>
contacts the wearer. The side flaps 147a and 147b may be formed by folding portions of the<br>
chassis 100 laterally inward, i.e., toward the longitudinal axis 42, to form both the respective side<br>
flaps 147a and 147b and the side edges 137a and 137b of the chassis 100. Alternatively, the side<br>
flaps 147a and 147b may be formed by attaching an additional layer or layers to the chassis 100 at<br>
or adjacent to each of the respective side edges 137a and 137b of the chassis 100. In<br>
embodiments in which the side flaps are formed by attaching an additional layer or layers to the<br>
chassis, each of the additional layer or layers may be attached at or adjacent to its laterally distal<br>
edge.<br>
Portions of a film backsheet 26 that are folded laterally inward to form the side flaps may<br>
^ contact the skin of a wearer during the use of the diaper 20. However, the alternating ridges and<br>
valleys in such a film backsheet that has been deformed in order to make it extensible may<br>
provide channels through which air can pass to alleviate any concern regarding such contact of the<br>
film backsheet with the skin.<br>
In embodiments hi which portions of me chassis 100 are folded laterally inward to form the<br>
side flaps 147a and 147b, the chassis 100 may simply be folded loosely or may be creased along a<br>
portion of each of its side edges 137a and 137b. For example, it may be desirable to form creases<br>
along portions of me side edges 137a and 137b in the crotch region 37 in order to impart a more<br>
finished appearance to the diaper 20. Alternatively or hi addition to creasing, a portion of each of<br>
the folded side flaps 147a and 147b adjacent to me side edges 137a and 137b may be attached to<br>
the interior surface 102 of the chassis 100 to achieve a similar result<br>
The left side flap 147a has a proximal edge 157a and the right side flap 147b has a proximal<br>
edge 157b. In the exemplary diaper 20 shown in Figure 1, the left side flap 147a and the right<br>
side flap 147b overlap ttie absorbent assembly 200, i.e., the proximal edge 157a and the proximal<br>
edge 157b lie laterally inward of the respective left side edge 237a and right side edge 237b of me<br>
absorbent assembly 208. Such an overlapped configuration may be desirable in order to impart a<br>
more finished appearance to the diaper 20 than that imparted by a non-overlapped configuration.<br>
Alternatively, the left side flap 147a and the right side flap 147b may not overlap the absorbent<br>
assembly 290, i.e., the proximal edge 157a and the proximal edge 157b may lie laterally outward<br>
of the respective left side edge 237a and right side edge 237b of the absorbent assembly 200.<br>
In tbe exemplary chassis 100 shown in Figure 1, the left side flap 147a and the right side<br>
flap 147b extend me Ml length of the chassis 100 between the frost waist edge 136 and the back<br>
waist edge 138. Such a full length configuration may be desirable in order to minimize the<br>
amount of waste material and the difficulty associated with the manufacture of the diaper 20,<br>
especially when the method used to manufacture the diaper 20 requires the introduction of the<br>
material or materials for the chassis 100 hi the form of a continuous web or multiple continuous<br>
webs. Alternatively, the side flaps may be shorter and extend less man the full distance between<br>
the front waist edge 136 and the back waist edge 138. Such a shorter configuration may be<br>
desirable in order to minimize the total amount of material used in the manufacture of the diaper<br>
Each of the side flaps 147a and 147b is attached to the interior surface 102 of the chassis<br>
100 in attachment zones located in the front waist region 36 and in the back waist region 38. For<br>
example, in the chassis 100 shown in Figure 1, the side flaps 147a and 147b are attached to the<br>
Ulterior surface 102 of the chassis 100 hi the adhesive attachment zones that are shown there and<br>
that are more clearly visible hi Figure 10, where the chassis 100 is shown laid out flat before the<br>
side flaps 147a and 1471} are formed, hi particular, the left side flap 147a is attached to the<br>
interior surface 102 of the chassis 100 in a longitudinally oriented adhesive attachment zone 151a<br>
adjacent to its proximal edge 157a near the front waist edge 136 and in a longitudinally opposing<br>
longitudinally oriented adhesive attachment zone 152a adjacent to its proximal edge 157a near the<br>
back waist edge 138. Similarly, the right side flap 147b is attached to the ulterior surface 102 of<br>
the chassis 100 in a longitudinally oriented adhesive attachment zone ISlb adjacent to its<br>
proximal edge 157b near the front waist edge 136 and in a longitudinally opposing longitudinally<br>
oriented adhesive attachment zone 152b adjacent to its proximal edge 157b near the back waist<br>
edge 138. The adhesive attachment zones may have equal areas or may be unequal in area. For<br>
example, the front longitudinally oriented adhesive attachment zones 151a and ISlb may be of<br>
one size and the back longitudinally oriented adhesive attachment zones 152a and 152b may be of<br>
another size.<br>
In the exemplary chassis 100 shown in Figure 1, the left side flap 147a is also attached to<br>
the interior surface 102 of the chassis 100 in a laterally oriented adhesive attachment zone 153a<br>
adjacent to the front waist edge 136 and in a longitudinally opposfeg laterally oriented adhesive<br>
attachment zone 154a adjacent to the back waist edge 138. Similarly, the right side flap 147b is<br>
attached to the interior surface 162 of the chassis 100 in a laterally oriented adhesive attachment<br>
zone 153b adjacent to the front waist edge 136 and in a longitudinally opposing laterally oriented<br>
adhesive attachment zone 154b adjacent to the back waist edge 138. The adhesive attachment<br>
zones may have equal areas or may be unequal in area. For example, the front laterally oriented<br>
adhesive attachment zones 153a and 153b may be of one size and the back laterally oriented<br>
adhesive attachment zones 154a and 154b may be of another size.<br>
Alternatively, each attachment zone may extend laterally across the full width of the<br>
respective side flap. For example, a laterally oriented adhesive attachment zone may extend<br>
laterally from the chassis left side edge 137a to the left side flap edge 157a and thereby attach the<br>
entire width of the left side flap 147a adjacent to the front waist edge 136 to the interior surface<br>
102 of the chassis 100. In embodiments in which the front edge 236 or the back edge 238 of the<br>
absorbent assembly 200 coincides with the respective front waist edge 136 or back waist edge of the chassis 100 and the side flaps 147 a and 147b overlap the absorbent assembly 200, the side<br>
flaps 147a and 147b may be attached to the absorbent assembly 200 instead of, or in addition to,<br>
being attached to the interior surface 102 of the chassis 100.<br>
Between the attachment zones, the proximal edges 157a and 157b of the side flaps 147a and<br>
147b remain free, i.e., are not attached to the interior surface 102 of the chassis 100 or to the<br>
absorbent assembly 200. Also between the attachment zones, each side flap preferably includes a<br>
longitudinally extensible flap elastic member that is attached adjacent to the proximal edge of the<br>
side flap by any of many well-known means. Each such flap elastic member may be attached<br>
over its entire length or over only a portion of its length. For example, such a flap elastic member<br>
may be attached only at or near its longitudinally opposing ends and may be unattached at the<br>
middle of its length. Such a flap elastic member may be disposed in the crotch region 37 and may<br>
extend into one or both of the front waist region 36 and the back waist region 38. For example, in<br>
the exemplary chassis 100 shown in Figure 1, an elastic strand 167a is attached adjacent to the<br>
proximal edge 157a of the left side flap 147a and extends into both the front waist region 36 and<br>
the back waist region 38. Similarly, an elastic strand 167b is attached adjacent to the proximal<br>
edge 157b of the right side flap 147b and extends into both the front waist region 36 and the back<br>
waist region 38.<br>
Each flap elastic member may be enclosed inside a folded hem. For example, in the<br>
exemplary chassis 100 shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5, the elastic strand 167a is enclosed inside<br>
a hem 170a formed adfaeeat to the proximal edge 157a of the left side flap 147a and the elastic<br>
strand 167b is enclosed inside a hem 170b formed adjacent to me proximal edge 157b of me right<br>
side flap 147b. Alternatively, th« flap elastic member may be sandwiched between two layers of<br>
the chassis, e.g., between the layers of a laminate backsheet or between a backsheet and an inner<br>
liner. As another alternative, the flap elastic member may be attached on a surface of the chassis<br>
100 and remain exposed.<br>
\yhen stretched, the flap elastic member adjacent to each side flap edge allows the side flap<br>
edge to extend to the flat uncontracted length of the chassis, eg., the length of the chassis 100, as<br>
shown in Figure 1. When allowed to relax, the flap elastic member contracts to gamer the portion<br>
of the side flap edge along which the flap elastic member is attached and thereby make the relaxed<br>
length of the side flap edge less than the flat uncontracted length of the chassis. For example,<br>
when the exemplary diaper 20 is in a relaxed condition as shown in Figure 16, the elastic strand<br>
167a contracts to gamer the proximal edge 157a of the left side flap 147a and the elastic strand<br>
167b contracts to gamer the proximal edge 157b of the right side flap 147b. The contractive<br>
forces of the elastic strands 167a and 167b are transmitted at the respective front attachment<br>
zones ISla and 151b to the ulterior surface 102 of the chassis 100 at the front waist region 36.<br>
Similarly, the contractive forces of the elastic strands 167a and 167b are transmitted at the<br>
respective back attachment zones 152a and 152b to the interior surface 102 of the chassis 100 at<br>
the back waist region 38. These contractive forces pull the front waist region 36 and the back<br>
waist region 38 toward each other and thereby bend the diaper 20 into a "U" shape hi which the<br>
interior of the "U" shape is formed by the portions of the diaper 20 mat are intended to be placed<br>
toward the body of the wearer. Because the proximal edge 157a remains free between the<br>
attachment zones ISla and 152a, the contractive force of the elastic strand 167a lifts the proximal<br>
edge 157a away from the interior surface 102 of the chassis 100. Similarly, because the proximal<br>
edge 157b remains free between the attachment zones 151b and 152b, the contractive force of the<br>
elastic strand 167b lifts the proximal edge 157b away from the interior surface 102 of the chassis<br>
100. As shown hi Figure 16, this lifting of the proximal edges 157a and 157b when the diaper is in the relaxed condition lifts the side flaps 147a and 147b into position to serve as side barriers<br>
adjacent to the side edges 237a and 237b of the absorbent assembly 200.<br>
When the diaper 20 is worn, the relaxed "U" shape generally conforms to the body of the<br>
wearer such that the front waist region 36 and the back waist region 38 can be fastened together to<br>
encircle the waist and the legs of the wearer. When the diaper 2© is worn in this manner, the<br>
elastic strands 167a and 167b tend to hold the lifted proximal edges 157a and 157b of the side<br>
flaps 147a and 147b in contact with the body of the wearer and thereby form seals to help prevent<br>
the leakage of deposited bodily waste out of the diaper 20. The lateral spacing of the lifted<br>
proximal edges 157a and 157b is selected to allow the deposit of bodily wastes from the lower<br>
torso of the wearer into the space between the lifted side flaps 147a and 147b and thereby directly<br>
onto the absorbent assembly 200. The width of each of the side flaps 147a and 147b in effect<br>
becomes its height when the free portion of its proximal edge is Hied and the side flap serves as a<br>
side barrier to leakage. This height preferably is selected to allow fee lilted proximal edges 157a<br>
and 157b to fit into the leg creases of the body of the wearer at fee same time as me absorbent<br>
assembly 200 is held in contact with the body.<br>
In the finished diaper, the chassis may have a generally rectangular shape, as in the<br>
exemplary diaper 20 shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. Such a generally rectangular configuration<br>
may be desirable in order to minimize the amount of waste material and the difficulty associated<br>
with the manufacture of the diaper 20. Alternatively, the chassis may have side edges 137a and<br>
137b that are not straight, but instead are curved and/or notched, thereby giving an overall shape<br>
in plan view of an hourglass or of an "I" to the diaper 20. Such a non-rectangular configuration<br>
may be desirable in order to impart a tailored appearance to the diaper 20 when it is worn. Such a<br>
non-rectangular configuration may also be desirable in order to impart an impression that the<br>
diaper 20 will fit comfortably between the legs of a wearer. Any one of many well-known ways<br>
may be used to form a non-rectangular configuration of the chassis. For example, laterally distal<br>
portions may be removed from the chassis to make its lateral dimension at and adjacent to the<br>
lateral axis 44 smaller man its lateral dimension at and adjacent to the front waist edge 136 and<br>
smaller than its lateral dimension at and adjacent to the back waist edge 138, i.e., to make the<br>
chassis narrower in me crotch region 37 than at the waist edges 136 and 138. Alternatively, a<br>
portion of each of me side edges 137a and 137b may be folded laterally inward in order to<br>
achieve the same result Such folded portions of the side edges 137a and 137b may be creased or<br>
attached, or both creased and attached, in order to prevent their unfbldment.<br>
An exemplary form of a non-rectangular configuration of fee chassis is shown in Figure 17.<br>
As shown in this figure, portions of fee chassis extending laterally between fee outer side edges<br>
and fee respective side edges in one or both of fee waist regions may be left laid out flat, i.e., may<br>
remain unfolded, when other portions are folded laterally inward to form fee side flaps. For<br>
example, as shown in Figure 17, fee portions 106a and 106b extending longitudinally from fee<br>
front waist edge 136 toward fee lateral axis 44 in fee front waist region 36 and extending laterally<br>
between each of fee outer side edges 155a and 155b and fee respective side edges 137a and 137b<br>
may be left laid out flat, i.e., may remain unfolded. Similarly, fee portions 108a and 108b<br>
extending longitudinally from fee back waist edge 138 toward fee lateral axis 44 hi fee back waist<br>
region 38 and extending laterally between each of fee outer side edges ISSa and ISSb and the<br>
respective side edges 137a and 137b may be left laid out flat, i.e., may remain unfolded. Other<br>
portions exteadiag loagitediBally between the portions that remain unfolded and through the<br>
crotch region 37 may be folded laterally inward to form the side flaps 147a and 147b. The<br>
portions 106a and 106b and me portions 108a and 108b form "eais" mat project laterally outward<br>
from each of the waist regions of me diaper. These ears project laterally outward beyond the<br>
inward-folded portions and impart an T' shape to the diaper, as shown in Figure 17. It is not<br>
necessary mat portions remain unfolded at both ends as shown in Figure 17. For example, the<br>
portions 186a and 106fe in me float waist region 36 may remain unfolded and only me portions<br>
108a and 108b in me back waist region 38 may be folded laterally inward, or vice versa, in some<br>
embodiments.<br>
An alternative way to form an T'-shaped non-rectangular configuration of the chassis as<br>
shown in Figure 17 is to form me chassis in the "I" shape and attach an additional layer or layers<br>
to the interior surface of the 'T'-shaped chassis at or adjacent to each of the side edges 137a and<br>
137b of the chassis 100 to form the respective side flaps 147a and 147b. In embodiments hi<br>
which the side flaps are formed by attaching an additional layer or layers to the chassis, each of<br>
the additional layer or layers may be attached at or adjacent to its laterally distal edge.<br>
Another exemplary way to form a non-rectangular configuration of the chassis is shown in<br>
Figure 18 and Figure 19. As shown in these figures, laterally opposing portions 107a and 107b<br>
of the chassis between each of the side edges 137a and 137b and the respective proximal edges<br>
157a and 157b of the side flaps 147a and 147b may be folded laterally inward in the crotch<br>
region 37 along respective diagonal fold lines 105a, lOSb, lOSc, and 105d such that each of the<br>
folded portions 107a and 107b of the chassis overlaps the absorbent assembly 200 in me crotch<br>
region 37. The interior surface 102 of each of the folded portions 107a and 107b may be attached<br>
to the ulterior surface 202 of the absorbent assembly hi the crotch region 37 at attachment zones<br>
109a and 109b. This folding and attachment forms "W" shaped folds 112a and 112b in the<br>
chassis in the crotch region 37 as shown in Figure 19, while retaining the configuration of the<br>
waist regions 36 and 38 as shown in Figure 3 and Figure 6. The overall effect on the shape of<br>
the chassis is to form an hourglass-shaped configuration as shown in Figure 18. The attachment<br>
zones 109a and 109i&gt; may be disposed symmetrically with respect to either or both of the<br>
longitudinal axis 42 and the lateral axis 44. Alternatively, the attachment zones 109a and 109b<br>
may be disposed asymmetrically with respect to either or both of me longitudinal axis 42 and the<br>
lateral axis 44. For example, the attachment zones 109a and 109b shown in Figure 18 are<br>
disposed symmetrically with respect to the longitudinal axis 42 and asymmetrically with respect<br>
to the lateral axis 44. In particular, the attachment zones 109a and 109b shown in Figure 1 are<br>
disposed asymmetrically toward the front waist region 36.<br>
Alternatively, the laterally opposing portions 107a and 107b of the chassis may be folded<br>
laterally inward in one or bom of the waist regions in addition to being folded laterally inward in<br>
the crotch region. For example, in order to simplify the manufecture of the diaper, the laterally<br>
opposing portions 107a and 107b of the chassis may be folded laterally inward over their entire<br>
longitudinal lengths. The ulterior surface 102 of each of the folded portions 107a and 107b may<br>
be attached to the interior surface 202 of the absorbent assembly hi the crotch region at<br>
attachment zones 109a and 109b. This folding and attachment forms "W" shaped folds 112a and<br>
112b in the chassis as shown in Figure 19 over the entire longitudinal lengths of the laterally<br>
opposing portions 107a and 107b of the chassis. An hourglass shape may subsequently be<br>
. imparted to the chassis when the laterally opposing portions are laterally extended by unfolding at<br>
m<br>
their longitudinally distal ends to prepare the disposable diaper for use in the configuration shown<br>
A portion or the whole of the chassis 100 may be made extensible to a degree greater than<br>
the inherent extensibility of the material or materials from which the chassis is made, e.g, the<br>
backsheet 26, the inner liner 22, or both. The additional extensibility may be desirable hi order to<br>
allow the chassis 100 to conform to the body of a wearer during movement by the wearer. The<br>
additional extensibility may also be desirable, for example, in order to allow the user of a diaper<br>
20 including a chassis 100 having a particular size before extension to extend the front waist<br>
region 36, the back waist region 38, or both waist regions of the chassis 100 to encircle the waist<br>
of an individual wearer whose waist circumference falls within a predefined range, i.e., to tailor<br>
the diaper to the individual wearer. Such extension of the waist region or regions may give the<br>
diaper a generally hourglass shape, so long as the crotch region 37 is extended to a relatively<br>
lesser degree man the waist region or regions, and may impart a tailored appearance to the diaper<br>
20 when it is worn. In addition, the additional extensibility may be desirable in order to minimize<br>
the cost of the diaper. For example, an amount of material that would otherwise be sufficient only<br>
to make a relatively smaller diaper lacking this extensibility can be used to make a diaper capable<br>
of being extended to fit a wearer larger than the smaller diaper would fit In other words, a lesser<br>
amount of material is needed in order to make a diaper capable of being properly fit onto a given<br>
size of a wearer when the material is made extensible as described.<br>
Additional extensibility in the chassis 100 in the lateral direction is relatively more useful<br>
man additional extensibility in the longitudinal direction. The abdomen of the wearer is likely to<br>
expand when the wearer changes posture from standing to sitting and the corresponding<br>
abdominal expansion increases the circumference that is encircled by the waist edges of the<br>
chassis 100, necessitating the lateral extension of the waist region or regions.<br>
Additional lateral extensibility in the chassis 1§0 may be provided in a variety of ways. For<br>
example, a material or materials from which the chassis 100 is made may be pleated by any of<br>
many known methods. Alternatively, all or a portion of the chassis may be made of a formed web<br>
material or a formed laminate of web materials like those descrifeed hi U.S. Patent No. 5,518,801<br>
issued on 21 May 1996 in me name of Chappell et al. An ex-emplary fragment 300 of such a<br>
formed web material 3«S is shown in Figure 20. This formed web material 305 includes distinct<br>
laterally extending regions 310 hi which the original material has been altered by embossing or<br>
another method of deformation to create a pattern of generally longitudinally oriented alternating<br>
ridges 312 and valleys 314. The formed web material 305 also includes laterally extending<br>
unaltered regions 316 located between the laterally extending altered regions 310.<br>
Such a formed web material 305 can be laterally extended beyond its original dimension<br>
with me application of relatively less force man that required to extend the same material to the<br>
same extent when undeformed. In particular, the effects of an application of opposing divergent<br>
forces directed generally perpendicular to the ridges 312 and valleys 314 include an extension of<br>
such a formed web material along an axis between the opposing forces and the generation of a<br>
resistive contractive force, primarily hi the unaltered regions 316. This resistive force is relatively<br>
smaller than the resistive force that is generated by the same material hi its unaltered form when<br>
extended to the same extent, at least up to an extension at which the ridges and valleys hi the<br>
altered regions flatten and begin to contribute to the resistive force. Thus, such formed web<br>
materials exhibit an extensible behavior resembling that of traditional elastic materials in the<br>
range of extensibility that is useful for the type of lateral extension desired for use in absorbent<br>
articles. However, such formed web materials may be made of relatively less expensive materials<br>
that are not inherently elastic and, thus, their use may provide an advantage in terms of the cost of<br>
manufacturing the absorbent articles.<br>
The range of extensibility of a web material or a laminate mat is formed as described hi the<br>
Chappell et al. '801 patent can be controlled by the degree of deformation of the altered regions<br>
and can be varied from near zero to a maximum that is dependent upon the original material. For<br>
example, the materials used in the chassis 100 of the exemplary diaper 20 may typically be<br>
formed to provide any range of extensibility from near zero to a maximum of more than 100<br>
percent of the original dimension. In some embodiments of the present invention, a portion of the<br>
chassis 100 may have a maximum extensibility of approximately 20 percent of its original<br>
dimension. However, any particular value for the maximum extensibility in the range from<br>
approximately one percent to approximately 100 percent may be selected to suit a particular<br>
choice of the original size of the diaper 20 and the range of sizes of the intended wearers. In<br>
particular, a diaper having a specific unextended waist opening circumference may be suitable for<br>
use on wearers aavag waist cfecraiferences ranging from equal to Ms unextended waist opening<br>
circumference up to fee maximum extensibility.<br>
The front laterally central portion 117 and the back IsteiaHy central portion 118 of the<br>
chassis 100 between the attachment zones 151,152,153, and 1S4 where the side flaps 147a and<br>
147b are attached to the interior surface 102 of the chassis adjacent to the respective waist edges<br>
137 and 138 may have a different range of extensibility from &amp;e portions of the chassis in the<br>
attachment zones. Additionalfy or alternatively, the laterally ceatral portions 117 and 118 may be<br>
extensible to a greater or lesser degree when subjected to a given level of opposing tensile forces,<br>
i.e., may be more easily or less easily extensible, than the portions of the chassis in the attachment<br>
zones. For example, if the chassis is made uniformly extensible across its entire width prior to the<br>
formation of the side flaps, the double layering hi the areas of the attachment zones after the<br>
formation of the side flaps may have an effect of decreasing the degree of lateral extensibility of<br>
those areas under a given level of opposing tensile forces, such as by the side flaps acting as<br>
parallel "springs" that must be extended in order to extend the underlying attached portion of the<br>
chassis. As another example, the altered regions hi the laterally central portions of the chassis<br>
may be deformed to a greater or a lesser degree than the altered regions in the attachment zones to<br>
render the laterally central portions more easily or less easily extensible than the respective<br>
portions hi the attachment zones.<br>
Such differential range of extensibility and/or differential relationship of tensile force to<br>
extensibility may be desirable. For example, when the waist regions are laterally extended by a<br>
user when applying a diaper to the body of a wearer, each waist region is typically subjected to a<br>
generally uniform level of opposing tensile forces across its entire width, so long as the user<br>
grasps the diaper at or adjacent to the laterally opposing side edges. If the laterally central portion<br>
of the chassis is less easily extensible than the portions in the attachment zones, the lateral spacing<br>
between the proximal edges 157a and 157b of the side flaps will increase less under a given level<br>
of applied tensile forces man if the laterally central portion were equally easily extensible or more<br>
easily extensible man the portions in the attachment zones. This effect of minimizing the change<br>
hi the lateral spacing between the side flaps may help to ensure that the diaper fits as intended on<br>
the body of the wearer by, for example, making it more likely that the proximal edges 157a and<br>
157b of me side flaps will fit into the teg creases of the body while the diaper is being worn.<br>
Any of a variety of materials may be formed as described in the Chappell et al. '801 patent.<br>
For example, a film, a nonwoven, or a laminate of either or bolfa of these materials may be formed<br>
to provide the desired extensibility. It is also possible to modify such a material in more man one<br>
way while forming it to provide extensibility. For example, a film that is originally formed to<br>
resist the permeation of vapor through its thickness and to contain, fine particles of a granular filler<br>
material such as calcium carbonate may be treated as described in the Chappell et al. '801 patent<br>
to simultaneously provide extensibility and create small holes that allow water vapor to pass<br>
through its thickness. Thus, Hie film can simultaneously be rendered extensible and breathable.<br>
The front waist region 36 and the back waist region 38 can be fastened together to encircle<br>
the waist and the legs of the wearer in many well-known ways. For example, separate fastening<br>
devices such as safety pins, separate tapes, a separate tie strap or straps, and/or a separate belt can<br>
be used for this purpose. Alternatively or in addition, fastening elements can be incorporated into<br>
the chassis 100 to enable a user to apply the diaper 20 to the body of the wearer without, or in<br>
conjunction with, any separate fastening devices. Many suitable types of such incorporated<br>
||r fastening elements are well-known, including, for example, tapes, adhesives, adhesive tape tabs,<br>
ties, buttons, hooks, loops, snap fasteners, other forms of mechanical fasteners, cohesive patches,<br>
etc. These incorporated fastening elements may project laterally outward, i.e., away from the<br>
longitudinal axis 42 beyond one or both of the side edges 137a and 137b and/or may project<br>
longitudinally outward, i.e., away from the lateral axis 44 beyond one or both of the waist edges<br>
136 and 138 or they may lie entirely inside the edges of the diaper 20. When a laminate<br>
backsheet is used and is oriented with the nonwoven disposed exteriorly, some forms of<br>
mechanical fasteners that typically require specific mating fastener elements, such as hooks that<br>
mate with loops, may be configured to engage with the nonwoven and thereby make the inclusion<br>
of the specific mating fastener element unnecessary.<br>
For example, as shown hi Figure 21 and Figure 22, laterally opposing adhesive tape tabs<br>
114a and 114b may be attached to the chassis 100 at or adjacent to the side edges 137a and 137b<br>
. of the diaper 20. The adhesive tape tabs 114a and 114b shown in Figure 21 and Figure 22<br>
•k^ project laterally outward from the respective side edges 137a and 137b in the back waist region<br>
38. In use, the adhesive tape tabs 114a and 114b shown hi Figure 21 and Figure 22 may be<br>
adhered to the exterior surface 104 of the chassis 100 hi the front waist region 36 to fasten the<br>
back waist region 38 to the front waist region 36 in a back-over-front manner. Alternatively,<br>
similar adhesive tape tabs may be attached to the chassis 100 in the front waist region 36 and used<br>
to fasten the front waist region 36 to the back waist region 38 hi a front-over-back manner.<br>
Suitable adhesive tapes are available from the 3M Corporation of St. Paul, Minnesota, U.S.A.,<br>
under the designation of XMF99121.<br>
Each of the adhesive tape tabs may be formed of two or more layers and different ones of<br>
these layers may be attached to different surfaces of the chassis. For example, as shown hi Figure<br>
21 and Figure 22, an ulterior layer 114c of the left adhesive tape tab 114a is attached onto the left<br>
side flap 147a, while an exterior layer 114d of the left adhesive tape tab 114a is attached onto the<br>
exterior surface 104 of the chassis 100. Similarly, an Ulterior layer 114e of the right adhesive tape<br>
tab 1Mb is attached omto me right side flap 147b, while aa exterior layer 114f of me right<br>
adhesive tape tab 1Mb is attached onto the exterior surface 104 of the chassis 100. This form of<br>
attachment of adhesive tape tabs to the chassis provides the advantage mat each of the interior<br>
layer and the exterior layer of each adhesive tape tab is subjected essentially to only a shear force<br>
at its attachment to the chassis, rather than being subjected to bath shear and peel forces. For<br>
example, any tendency of the interior layer 114c to peel off of the left side flap M7a is<br>
counteracted by the exterior layer 114d acting in tension to prevent the ulterior layer 114c from<br>
peeling off. Conversely, any tendency of the exterior layer 114d to peel off of the exterior surface<br>
104 of the chassis 160 is counteracted by the interior layer 114c acting in tension to prevent me<br>
exterior layer 114d from peeling off. The exterior layers of the adhesive tape tabs shown in<br>
Figure 21 and Figure 22 extend farmer toward the longitudinal axis man do the interior layers of<br>
the adhesive tape tabs. Alternatively, the interior layers may extend farther toward the<br>
longitudinal axis than the exterior layers, or both layers may extend equally far toward the<br>
longitudinal axis. If the materials onto which the layers of the ad&amp;esive tape tab differ in tensile<br>
strength or if the attachment of the adhesive tape tab is relatively more secure on one of the<br>
surfaces, it may be desirable that the layer that is attached to tie stronger material or mat is more<br>
securely attached to the surface extend farther toward the longitudinal axis in order to distribute<br>
the force carried by the adhesive tape tab disproportionately onto me stronger material or the more<br>
secure attachment.<br>
Optionally, a fastening sheet 116 may be attached onto the exterior surface 104 of the<br>
chassis 100 in the front waist region 36 as shown in Figure 21 and Figure 22. The fastening<br>
sheet 116 shown in Figure 21 and Figure 22 lies entirely inside the edges of the diaper 20.<br>
Alternatively, two or more discrete fastening sheets may be attached onto the exterior surface of<br>
the chassis, instead of a single fastening sheet. For example, two laterally opposing fastening<br>
sheets may be attached in locations approximately corresponding to the left and right portions of<br>
the single fastening sheet 116. When a fastening sheet is provided, the adhesive tape tabs may be<br>
adhered to the fastening sheet to fasten the back waist region 38 and the front waist region 36<br>
together. The fastening sheet may be formed of a material used elsewhere hi the diaper, such as a<br>
film or a nonwoven. In embodiments hi which the chassis is extensible, it is preferred that any<br>
fastening sheet also be extensible such that the fastening sheet will not restrict the extensibility of<br>
the portion of the chassis onto which it is attached. For example, an extensible nonwoven may be<br>
used for the fastening sheet The fastening sheet serves to distribute the tensile force transmitted<br>
by each of the adhesive tape tabs over an area of the backsheet 26 mat is larger than the adhered<br>
area of the adhesive tape tab. In addition, when a single fastening sheet such as fastening sheet<br>
116 in Figure 21 and Figure 22 is used, the fastening sheet may, itself, bear a portion of the<br>
tensile force between the laterally opposing adhesive tape tabs aad thereby relieve a portion of the<br>
force exerted on the backsheet Thus, the incorporation of such a fastening sheet may be<br>
desirable, for example, in order to make it possible to use a relatively inexpensive and relatively<br>
weak material for the backsheet 26. The fastening sheet may be formed of a material having<br>
greater strength than the backsheet Such a stronger material may be more expensive per unit area<br>
than me backsheet, but the fastening sheet may be relatively smaller than the backsheet<br>
Therefore, the total cost of a diaper having a fastening sheet may be less man the total cost of a<br>
diaper having a backsheet having sufficient strength for adhesive tape tabs to be adhered directly<br>
to the exterior surface of the backsheet<br>
Exemplary fastening elements in the form of cohesive fastening patches are described hi this<br>
application and the description of their disposition, configuration, and use is intended to apply to<br>
any other type of incorporated fastening element insofar as is practical for each such type of<br>
fastening element.<br>
Exemplary fastening elements in the form of cohesive fastening patches may be formed of<br>
an inherently crystalline water-based synthetic elastomer to which a tackifying agent has been<br>
added to disrupt the polycrystalline structure and thereby reader me elastomer cohesive. Such<br>
synthetic cohesive products are available from Andover Coated Products, Incorporated, of<br>
Salisbury, Massachusetts, U.S.A. and are described in U.S. Patent No. 6,156,424 issued on 5<br>
December 2000 in the name of Taylor. A cohesive elastomeric fastening element preferably<br>
remains extensible in use. Thus, when applied onto an extensible chassis, such a cohesive<br>
elastomeric fastening element may be capable of extending as the extensible chassis extends. As<br>
a result, when subjected to the tensile hoop forces typically found at the waist opening of a diaper<br>
when the diaper is worn, the area of attachment of two cohesive elastomeric fastening elements to<br>
each other may be subject only to a shearing force, rather than being subjected to a peeling force.<br>
This behavior may enable the fastening elements to remain cohered even when they are extended<br>
because cohesive fastening elements typically exhibit relatively higher resistance to shearing<br>
forces man to peeling forces.<br>
Cohesive fastening patches may be formed by the application of a cohesive material directly<br>
onto the chassis or onto a separate substrate that is in turn attached to the chassis. For example, a<br>
"hot melt" cohesive material may be applied in its molten state onto a surface and allowed to cool<br>
and solidify to form such a patch. The cohesive material may be applied hi any of a variety of<br>
patterns, such as a continuous film, discrete dots, stripes, polygons, etc., and/or spaced and<br>
interconnected geometric elements describing a grid.<br>
Exemplary cohesive fastening patches are shown incorporated into the chassis in Figure 1,<br>
Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 6, Figure 10, Figure 11, Figure 12, Figure 15, Figure 23, and<br>
Figure 24. In these exemplary embodiments, a cohesive fastening patch HOa is disposed on the<br>
exterior of the chassis 16® in the front waist region 36 adjacent to the left side edge 137a and a<br>
laterally opposing cohesive fastening patch HOb is disposed on the exterior of the chassis 100 in<br>
the front waist region 36 adjacent to the right side edge 137b. A cohesive fastening patch 120a is<br>
disposed on the interior of the chassis 100 in the back waist region 36 adjacent to the left side<br>
edge 137a and a laterally opposing cohesive fastening patch 120b is disposed on the interior of<br>
the chassis 100 in the back waist region 38 adjacent to the right side edge 137b. When the diaper<br>
20 is worn as shown in Figure 23 and Figure 24, the back left cohesive fastening patch 120a<br>
overlaps the front left cohesive fastening patch HOa and the cohesion of these two cohesive<br>
fastening patches fastens the front waist region 36 and the back waist region 38 together at the side of the diaper 20. Similarly, the back right cohesive fastening patch 120b overlaps the front<br>
right cohesive fastening patch HOb and the cohesion of these two cohesive fastening patches<br>
fastens the front waist region 36 and the back waist region 38 together at the right side of the<br>
diaper 20. Thus, the configuration of the cohesive fastening patches shown in these figures is<br>
adapted for back-over-front fastening. Alternatively, the front cohesive fastening patches may be<br>
disposed on the ulterior of the chassis hi the front waist region and the back cohesive fastening<br>
patches may be disposed on the exterior of the chassis in order to adapt the configuration of the<br>
cohesive fastening patches for front-over-back fastening. In Figure 23 and Figure 24, the<br>
cohesive fastening patches are shown overlapped but not exactly aligned along any of thenrespective<br>
edges only for clarity of illustration and can actually be aligned as desired, e.g., to<br>
maximize their areas of overlap.<br>
Alternatively, the cohesive fastening patches may be disposed in a reversible configuration<br>
that is adapted to provide the user of the diaper 20 with both options for fastening, i.e., either<br>
back-over-front or front-over-back, according to personal preference. When the cohesive<br>
fastening patches are disposed on both the exterior and the interior of the chassis 100, a back<br>
cohesive fastening patch may overlap a front cohesive fastening patch or the front cohesive<br>
fastening patch may overlap the back cohesive fastening patch and, in either arrangement, the<br>
cohesive fastening patches fasten the front waist region 36 and the back waist region 38 together<br>
at the side of me diaper 20. Thus, with this configuration of the cohesive fastening patches, the<br>
fastening of the diaper 20 at the sides is reversible so mat each side can be fastened in a backover-<br>
front manner or, alternatively, in a front-over-back manner.<br>
Two such reversible configurations of cohesive fastening patches are shown in Figure 25,<br>
Figure 26, Figure 27, and Figure 28. In the first of these exemplary configurations, a cohesive<br>
fastening patch llOa wraps around the left side edge 137a and is disposed on both me exterior<br>
and me intenor of the chassis 100 in the front waist region 36 adjacent to the left side edge 137a.<br>
A laterally opposing cohesive fastening patch llOb wraps around the right side edge 137b and is<br>
disposed on bom the exterior aad the interior of the chassis Itt in the front waist region 36<br>
adjacent to the right side edge 137b. Such a continuous configaration may be desirable, for<br>
example, in order to allow the cohesive polymer for each cohesive fastening patch to be applied in<br>
a single area mat is men folded over when the corresponding folded side flap is formed in a<br>
manufacturing process.<br>
hi the second exemplary reversible configuration of the cohesive fastening patches, a pair of<br>
back cohesive fastening patches 120a and 120b do not extend around the side edges 137a and<br>
137b and thus are not continuous from the exterior to the interior of the chassis 100. Instead, a<br>
back left interior cohesive fastening patch 120a and a back left exterior cohesive fastening patch<br>
120c are disposed on the respective interior and exterior of the chassis 100 adjacent to the left side<br>
edge 137a in the back waist region 38. Similarly, a back right interior cohesive fastening patch<br>
120b and a back right exterior cohesive fastening patch 120d are disposed on the respective<br>
interior and exterior of the chassis 100 adjacent to the right side edge 137b in the back waist<br>
region 38. Such a discontinuous configuration may be desirable, for example, in order to allow<br>
the cohesive polymer to be applied after the side flaps are formed in a manufacturing process. In<br>
general, any or all of the cohesive fastening patches may extend around the side edges 137a and<br>
137b or may be discontinuous from the exterior to the interior of the chassis 100.<br>
As an alternative to overlapping cohesive fastening patches to fasten the front waist region<br>
36 and the back waist region 38 together to encircle the waist and the legs of the wearer, the<br>
fastening patches may be disposed on the interior surface of the chassis and may be abutted in a<br>
face-to-face arrangement to form a flanged connection in which, for example, a portion of the side<br>
edge 137a in the back waist region and a portion of the same side edge 137a in the front waist<br>
region are superposed, i.e., unlike an overlapped connection, both of the portions of the side edge<br>
are exposed in such a flanged connection.<br>
The exemplary diapers shown in Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 6, Figure 10, Figure<br>
11, Figure 12, Figure 15, Figure 23, and Figure 24 include discrete laterally opposing cohesive<br>
fastening patches. Alternatively, a single laterally extending cohesive fastening patch may be<br>
attached at each of the longitudinally opposing waist regions of the diaper. For example, each<br>
such single cohesive fastening patch may extend laterally jo approximately the lateral extent mat<br>
is defined by the laterally distal edges of the discrete cohesive fastening patches shown in these<br>
figures. Thus, such a single cohesive fastening patch may have approximately the same extent<br>
and be located in approximately the same location as the fastening sheet 116 shown in Figure 21<br>
and Figure 22.<br>
Description of the Absorbent Assembly<br>
As shown in Figure 29, Figure 36, and Figure 31, the absorbent assembly 260 includes an<br>
absorbent core 250. The absorbent core 250 has a laterally extending front edge 256 in the front<br>
waist region 36 and a longitudinally opposing and laterally extending back edge 258 in the back.<br>
waist region 38. The absorbent core 250 also has a longitudniaily extending left side edge 257a<br>
and a laterally opposing and longitudinally extending right side edge 257b, both absorbent core<br>
side edges extending longitudinally between the front edge 256 and the back edge 258. Any or all<br>
of the respective front edge 256, back edge 258, left side edge 257a, and right side edge 257b of<br>
the absorbent core 256 may lie inward of the respective front edge 236, back edge 238, left side<br>
edge 237a, and right side edge 237b of the absorbent assembly 200. For example, in me<br>
exemplary absorbent assembly 200 shown in Figure 29, the absorbent core 250 has its left side<br>
edge 257a and right side edge 257b located laterally inward of, respectively, the left side edge<br>
237a and right side edge 237b of the absorbent assembly 266. Alternatively, one or more of the<br>
edges of the absorbent core 256 may coincide with the corresponding edge of the absorbent<br>
assembly 200. For example, hi the exemplary absorbent assembly 206 shown in Figure 29, the<br>
front edge 256 and back edge 258 of the absorbent core 250 coincide with the respective front<br>
edge 236 and back edge 238 of the absorbent assembly 200.<br>
The absorbent assembly 266 may be attached to the chassis 160 over any part or the whole<br>
of the area of the absorbent assembly 260. Preferably, the absorbent assembly 206 is attached on<br>
its exterior surface 264 to the chassis 166 in a cruciform attachment pattern, i.e., in an attachment<br>
pattern mat forms or is arranged in a cross or "+" shape. The cruciform attachment pattern may<br>
be contiguous, i.e., all of its portions may be touching or connected throughout the pattern in an<br>
unbroken sequence. Alternatively, the cruciform attachment pattern may include detached<br>
portions and thereby lack contiguity but still be arranged such that the shape of the overall pattern<br>
is a cruciform. For example, a discontiguous cruciform attachment pattern may include a<br>
longitudinally extending portion disposed along the longitudinal axis and separate left and right<br>
laterally distal portions disposed along or adjacent to the lateral axis and thereby form a cruciform<br>
as the shape of the overall pattern.<br>
An exemplary contiguous cruciform attachment pattern 21® is shown in Figure 26, Figure<br>
29, Figure 30, and Figure 31. Hie portions of the chassis 100 feat lie outside such a cruciform<br>
attachment pattern are not restrained by attachment to the absorbent assembly 200 and therefore<br>
remain extensible. In-particular, a relatively narrow longitudinally extending portion 212 of a<br>
cruciform attachment pattern 210 like that shown in Figure 29 aad Figure 31 leaves the majority<br>
of the width of the chassis 100 in the front waist region 36 and m the back waist region 38 freely<br>
extensible and thereby allows extension of the chassis 100 hi the lateral direction in these regions.<br>
A relatively wide laterally extending portion 214 of a cruciform attachment pattern 210 like that<br>
shown in Figure 29 and Figure 30 prevents the portion of the chassis 100 in the crotch region to which the absorbent assembly 200-is attached from shifting relative to the absorbent assembly<br>
200 hi that region. A relatively wide laterally extending portion 214 of a cruciform attachment<br>
pattern 210 may also contribute to the effectiveness of the side Saps 147a and 147b when the<br>
elastic strands 167a and 167b lift the proximal edges 157a and 157b into contact with the body of<br>
the wearer. For example, if the chassis 100 in the crotch region 37 were free to shift laterally<br>
inward, i.e., toward tie longitudinal axis 42 such that the left side edge 137a and/or the right side<br>
edge 137b moved toward the longitudinal axis 42, the side flaps 147a and 147b might easily<br>
distort and fail to maintain contact with the body. However, because the relatively wide laterally<br>
extending portion 214 of the cruciform attachment pattern 210 restrains the chassis 100 over a<br>
relatively wide portion of the width of the crotch region 37, fee side flaps 147a and 147b are<br>
better supported at their bases while being lifted by the elastic strands 167a and 167b.<br>
The cruciform attachment pattern 210 in Figure 29, Figure SO, and Figure 31 extends<br>
laterally from near the left side edge 237a to near the right side edge 237b of the absorbent<br>
assembly 200 at and adjacent to the lateral axis 44, but does not extend laterally to this extent over<br>
the full length of the absorbent assembly 200. Similarly, the cruciform attachment pattern 210 in<br>
Figure 29, Figure 30, and Figure 31 extends longitudinally from near the front edge 236 to near<br>
the back edge 238 of the absorbent assembly 200 at and adjacent to the longitudinal axis 42, but<br>
does not extend longitudinally to this extent over the full width of the absorbent assembly 200.<br>
Alternatively, the cruciform attachment pattern 210 may extend to any or all of the side edges<br>
237a and 237b and the front edge 236 and the back edge 238 of me absorbent assembly 200. For<br>
example, the cruciform attachment pattern 210 may extend laterally from the left side edge 237a<br>
to the right side edge 237b of the absorbent assembly 200, but may extend longitudinally only a<br>
part of the distance from the front edge 236 to the back edge 238 of the absorbent assembly 200.<br>
Within the extent of the cruciform attachment pattern 210, the absorbent assembly 200 may be<br>
attached to the chassis 100 continuously or intermittently. For example, a film of an adhesive<br>
may be applied continuously over the entire area of the cruciform attachment pattern and men<br>
used to continuously attach the absorbent assembly to the chassis. As an alternative example, an<br>
adhesive may be applied discontinuously at and inside the boundaries of the cruciform attachment<br>
pattern, such as in the form of dots, stripes, beads, spirals, etc., and then used to attach the<br>
absorbent assembly to the chassis.<br>
The cruciform attachment pattern 210 may be disposed symmetrically with respect to either<br>
or bom of the longitudinal axis 42 and the lateral axis 44 of tie chassis 100. Alternatively, the<br>
cruciform attachment pattern 210 may be disposed asymmetrically with respect to either or both<br>
of the longitudinal axis 42 and the lateral axis 44. For example, the cruciform attachment pattern<br>
210 shown in Figure 29 is disposed symmetrically wim respect to the longitudinal axis 42 and<br>
asymmetrically with respect to the lateral axis 44. In particular, the cruciform attachment pattern<br>
210 shown in Figure 29 is disposed asymmetrically toward the front waist region 36. Also, the<br>
laterally extending portion 214 of the cruciform attachment pattern 210 may be located distant<br>
from the lateral axis 44 and the longitudinally extending portion 212 of the cruciform attachment<br>
pattern 210 may similarly be located distant from the longitodinal axis 42. In addition, the<br>
cruciform attachment pattern 210 may be disposed symmetrically with respect to either or both of<br>
the side edges 237a and 237b and the front edge 236 and me back edge 238 of me absorbent<br>
assembly 200. For example, the cruciform attachment pattern 210 shown in Figure 29 is<br>
disposed symmetrically with respect to both the side edges 237a and 237b and the front edge 236<br>
and tie back edge 238, i.e., the cruciform attachment pattern 210 shown in Figure 29 is centered<br>
on the absorbent assembly 2410. Alternatively, the cruciform attachment pattern 210 may be<br>
disposed asymmetrically with respect to either or both of the side edges 237a and 237b and front<br>
edge 236 and back edge 238 of the absorbent assembly 200, i.e., tie cruciform attachment pattern<br>
210 may be disposed off-center on the absorbent assembly 200.<br>
The absorbent core 250 may be disposed between a lower covering sheet mat is disposed on<br>
the exterior face of the absorbent core 250 in a face-to-face arrangement with the interior surface<br>
102 of the chassis and an upper covering sheet mat is disposed on the interior face of the<br>
absorbent core 250. Such an upper covering sheet and lower covering sheet may be attached<br>
together to contain the absorbent core 250 between mem and thereby form the absorbent assembly<br>
* 200. For example, in the exemplary absorbent assembly 200 shown in Figure 29, Figure 30, and<br>
Figure 31, an upper covering sheet 24 and a lower covering sbeet 25 are attached together at or<br>
adjaceat to the side edges 237a and 237b of the absorbent assembly 200 in longitudinally<br>
extending adhesive attachment zones 29a and 29b. Alternatively, the upper covering sbeet 24 and<br>
the lower covering sheet 25 may be attached together in places other man the side edges 237a and<br>
237b of the absorbent assembly 200, e.g., at or adjacent to the end edges 236 and 238 of the<br>
absorbent assembly 2f», or at or adjacent to both the end edges 236 and 238 and the side edges<br>
237a and 237b.<br>
The upper covering sheet 24 is water-permeable and allows liquid waste to pass through to<br>
me absorbent core 2S0, where the liquid waste is absorbed. The tower covering sheet 25 may be<br>
water-impermeable. However, the lower covering sheet 25 preferably is water-permeable. In<br>
embodiments in which bom the upper covering sheet 24 and the lower covering sheet 25 are<br>
water-permeable, any liquid waste that is deposited onto the upper covering sheet 24 but does not<br>
pass through the upper covering sheet 24 to the absorbent core 259 can flow around an edge of the<br>
absorbent assembly 20€ to reach the lower covering sheet 25 and then pass through the lower<br>
covering sheet 25 to the absorbent core 250.<br>
The upper covering sheet 24 may form the interior surface 202 of the absorbent assembly<br>
200 that is intended to be placed against the body of the wearer. The upper covering sheet 24<br>
preferably is formed of a soft material that will not irritate the skin of the wearer. Many materials<br>
mat are suitable for a water-permeable covering sheet are well-known in the art, including<br>
synthetic nonwovens such as spunbonded or carded polypropylene, polyester, or rayon. Likewise,<br>
many materials mat are suitable for a covering sheet that is water-impermeable are well-known in<br>
the art, including the materials that are suitable for the backsheet 26.<br>
The upper covering sheet 24 and the lower covering sheet 25 may extend to the same width<br>
and me same leagth. Alternatively, one or more of the edges of one of the covering sheets may lie<br>
distalfy relative to me respective edge or edges of the other covering sheet. For example, the<br>
upper covering sheet may extend longitudinally only to an extent sufficient to cover the absorbent<br>
core and the lower covering sheet may extend longitudinally beyond the upper covering sheet<br>
toward or to the adjacent waist edge. Such an extended covering sheet may serve to isolate the<br>
skin of the wearer from a portion of the backsheet 26 as may be desirable, for example, when the<br>
diaper 20 is worn under conditions in which contact between the skin and a backsheet film could<br>
be uncomfortable.<br>
Suitable absorbent materials for the absorbent core are well-known, including cellulose<br>
fibers in the form of comminuted wood pulp, which is commonly known as "airfelt", layers or<br>
sheets of natural or synthetic fibrous material, superabsorbent polymer, etc. These absorbent<br>
materials may be used separately or in combination. Many known absorbent materials may be<br>
used in a discrete form, i.e., in the form of fibers, granules, particles, and the like. Such a discrete<br>
form of an absorbent material may be immobilized by an adhesive mat attaches the discrete pieces<br>
together to form a coherent layer or that attaches the discrete pieces to a substrate layer, such as a<br>
covering sheet, or that attaches the discrete pieces both to each other and to the substrate layer.<br>
Alternatively, the discrete form of an absorbent material may be immobilized in pockets<br>
formed by a layer of a thermoplastic material, such as a hot raek adhesive, mat intermittently<br>
contacts and adheres to a substrate, such as a covering sheet, while diverging away from the<br>
substrate at the pockets. Absorbent assemblies having such sfructures are described in European<br>
Patent Applications Nos. 03 002 678.5 and 03 002 677.7, both Sted oa 12 February 2003 in the<br>
name of Ehmsperger et al, and in co-pending and commonly assigned U.S. Patent Applications<br>
Nos. 10/776,839 and 10/776,851, bom filed on 11 February 20S4 in the name of Ehmsperger et<br>
al. with respective priority claims to the aforementioned European Applications. An exemplary<br>
absorbent assembly 290 having such a structure is shown in Figure 32. In this absorbent<br>
A assembly 208, the absorbent core 250 includes particles of superabsorbent polymer 270 mat are<br>
contained inside pockets 280 formed by a layer 275 of a thermoplastic material. This absorbent<br>
core 250 contains no cellulose fibers. Alternatively, the absoibent core 250 may include bom<br>
particles of superabsorbent polymer and airfelt and both materials may be contained inside the<br>
pockets formed by the layer of the thennoplastic material. As shown in Figure 32, the layer 275<br>
of the thennoplastic material intermittently contacts and adheres to the lower covering sheet 25 at<br>
the areas of attachment 282. Between the areas of attachment 282, the layer 275 diverges away<br>
from the lower covering sheet 25 to form the pockets 280. The layer 275 may have the form of a<br>
sheet of fibers of the thermoplastic material through which the liquid waste may pass to the<br>
particles of superabsorbent polymer 270 to be absorbed.<br>
In Figure 32, a separate upper covering sheet 24 is shown overlying the layer 275 of the<br>
thermoplastic material. Alternatively, the separate upper covering sheet 24 may be omitted and<br>
the layer 275 in the form of a fibrous sheet may serve as the upper covering sheet 24. As another<br>
W alternative, two absorbent assemblies each like that shown in Figure 32 except for the omission<br>
of the upper covering sheet 24 may be superposed with one absoibent assembly inverted such mat<br>
its pockets nest into the recesses at the areas of attachment 282 of the other absorbent assembly<br>
and the respective single covering sheets distally oppose each other. In such a combined<br>
absorbent assembly 200, the distally opposing single covering sheets may serve respectively as<br>
the upper covering sheet 24 and the lower covering sheet 25.<br>
In the exemplary absorbent assembly 200 shown in Figure 29, Figure 30, and Figure 31,<br>
the upper covering sheet 24 and the lower covering sheet 25 are of the same size, i.e., both the<br>
upper covering sheet 24 and the lower covering sheet 25 extend to the front edge 236 and back<br>
edge 238, as well as to the left side edge 237a and right side edge 237b of the absorbent assembly<br>
200. Alternatively, the upper covering sheet 24 and the lower covering sheet 25 may differ in<br>
size. For example, the lower covering sheet 25 may be larger ton the upper covering sheet 24<br>
and may be wrapped over fee side edges 257a and 257b of the absoibent core 250 onto the<br>
interior surface of the absorbent core 250, where the upper covering sheet 24 and the lower<br>
covering sheet 25 may be attached together. Alternatively, in place of a separate upper covering<br>
sheet 24 and a separate lower covering sheet 25, a single covering sheet may be wrapped around<br>
the absorbent core 250 asd attached to itself to contain the absorbent core 250. Such a single<br>
covering sheet forms an upper layer and a lower layer when wrapped around the absorbent core<br>
250 and, in general, the description of the separate upper covering sheet 24 and lower covering<br>
sheet 25 are intended to apply to such upper and lower layers of a wrapped single covering sheet<br>
At a minimum, the absorbent core 250 is contained laterally by the covering sheet or sheets<br>
being wrapped around the absorbent core 250 or attached togefeer at or adjacent to the left side<br>
edge 237a and right side edge 237b of the absorbent assembly 200. For example, in the<br>
exemplary absorbent assembly 200 shown hi Figure 29, Figure 30, and Figure 31, the upper<br>
covering sheet 24 and the lower covering sheet 25 are attached together only in left adhesive<br>
attachment zone 29a and right adhesive attachment zone 29b at or adjacent to the respective left<br>
side edge 237a and right side edge 237b of the absorbent assembly 200. In this embodiment, the<br>
upper covering sheet 24 and the lower covering sheet 25 cannot be attached directly together at or<br>
adjacent to the front edge 236 and back edge 238 because the absorbent core 250 extends die full<br>
length of the absorbent assembly 200, i.e. the front edge 256 and back edge 258 of the absorbent<br>
core 250 coincide with the respective front edge 236 and back edge 238 of the absorbent assembly<br>
200. In such an embodiment, the upper and lower layers of me covering sheet or sheets may each<br>
be attached to the absorbent core 250 at or adjacent to the front edge 256 and back edge 258 of the<br>
absorbent core 250 to form a sandwich. In addition, a sealing agent may be apph'ed at or adjacent<br>
to the front edge 256 and back edge 258 of the absorbent core 250 to contain any fibers or<br>
particles that might otherwise escape the absorbent core 250. Alternatively, instead of being<br>
contained only laterally by the covering sheet or sheets, the absorbent core 250 may additionally<br>
be contained longitudinally by the upper and lower layers of the covering sheet or sheets being<br>
attached together at or adjacent to the front edge 236 and back edge 238 of the absorbent<br>
assembly 200.<br>
