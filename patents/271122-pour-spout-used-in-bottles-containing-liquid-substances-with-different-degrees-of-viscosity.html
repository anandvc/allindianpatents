Pour spout used in bottles containing liquid<br>
substances with different degrees of viscosity<br>
This invention relates to a pour spout used in bottles containing<br>
liquid substances with different degrees of viscosity, such as oils or vinegars.<br>
Preferably, the present invention relates to a pour spout to be used in<br>
containers such as bottles for oil pouring.<br>
It is known the use of additives in different foods in order to<br>
prepare the most varied and delicious dishes. Among these additives, the most<br>
 known and widely used is vegetal oil in all of its commercially available<br>
variations. As it is publicly known, oil has a high degree of viscosity, turning it<br>
 into a substance' very difficult to cleanse, and which also allows particles to<br>
adhere to any surface whereon such a substance- is placed. For instance, in<br>
cases where the oil is bottled in tin containers, it is very common to see that<br>
the top of said container is normally impregnated with dust particles, and<br>
debris. The particle and debris must be removed and the top surface cleaned<br>
before and after its use, since the residue of drops after serving the product.<br>
makes said particles to easily adhere to the surface. It should be clarified that<br>
this task of cleansing the top surface of the container is really cumbersome and<br>
that task should be carried out carefully enough.to completely remove the<br>
substance.<br><br>
2<br>
Alternatively, plastic bottles are widely used as oil containers.<br>
These containers have a pour spout which generally has a cap that allows the<br>
container to be closed once it was opened. On the other hand, such pour<br>
spouts prevents, according to their special design, the dripping of droplets<br>
remaining at the edge of the spout. However, the main problem of these types<br>
of containers is that said pour spout does not offer a way to regulate the liquid<br>
flow coming through once the bottle is tilted in order to serve their content in<br>
the food. Therefore the flow had to be carefully regulated by the cook or person-<br>
preparing such a dish, and in most of the cases it happens that the amount of<br>
oil poured into the dish is always greater than the necessary or required.<br>
Thus, the present invention is aimed to provide a pour spout used<br>
in bottles containing liquid substances with different degrees of viscosity in<br>
order provide the possibility of pouring the necessary amount of liquid to be<br>
served.<br>
This invention is also aimed to provide a pour spout used in<br>
bottles containing liquid substances with different degrees of viscosity that<br>
gives the possibility of using a single spout to alternatively serve at least two<br>
different flows.<br>
Thus, this invention is aimed to provide a pour spout used in<br>
bottles containing liquid substances with different degrees of viscosity, where<br>
the pour spout consists of an outlet opening which is defined by at least a first<br><br>
3<br>
and a second pouring orifice for the liquid substances, being the pouring area of<br>
the first orifice bigger than or equal to the pouring area of the second orifice.<br>
Other objects, features and advantages of the invention will<br>
become apparent from a consideration of the following detailed description and<br>
the accompanying drawings.<br>
FIG. 1 is a top perspective view of the pour spout of this<br>
invention;<br>
FIG. 2 is a top plant view of the cap in FIG.   1.<br>
FIG. 3 is a top perspective view of the spout in FIG. 1; and<br>
FIG. 4 is a bottom perspective view of the cap in FIG.   1.<br>
Referring to the figures, it is shown the pour spout 1 of this<br>
invention, which comprises an outlet opening 2 which is defined by at least a<br>
first orifice 3 and a second orifice 4. These orifices 3 and 4 define the pouring,<br>
of the liquid substances held in the container (not illustrated) whereto this pour<br>
spout 1 is applied. In this particular embodiment, said orifices are arranged<br>
symmetrically facing each other for a better use of the features that the pour<br>
spout provides. However this arrangement of the orifices 3 and 4 should not be<br>
taken as a limitation of the scope of this invention. It should neither be taken as<br>
a limitation to the geometrical shaping of said orifices 3 and 4, since those<br>
illustrated by FIGS 1 to 4 are shown only for illustration purposes.<br>
As it can be observed in FIGS. 1 and 2, the pouring area 5 of the<br><br>
4<br>
first orifice 3 is, in this particular embodiment, bigger than the pouring area 6 of<br>
the second orifice 4. It is important to point out that even though it has been<br>
described that the pouring area 5 is bigger than the pouring area 6, it may not<br>
be so since it is possible that there couid be no difference between said pouring<br>
areas 5 and 6, or even that the pouring area 6 is bigger than the pouring area<br>
5; being these alternatives comprised in the scope and spirit of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Alternatively, it is observed that from the pouring opening 2 a rim<br>
neck projects defining a sort of pour spout that comprises two grooves 10<br>
which define anti-dripping zones. As observed, each of said grooves 10 is<br>
strictly related to its corresponding orifice, allowing the liquid held in the<br>
container to be easily served and preventing the dripping of the remaining<br>
liquid in the pouring opening 2, once the content is already served.<br>
Making reference to FIG. 3, it is possible to observe that the<br>
pouring opening is closed by lids 7 and 8. These lids 7 and 8 restrain the exit<br>
of the liquid through orifices 3 and 4. These lids are joined by a hinge 11 that<br>
allows them to pivot from an opened position to a closed position. On the other<br>
hand, each lid 7 and 8 presents a pulling portion 12 allowing the easy opening<br>
and dosing of said lids 7 and 8. Furthermore, said portions 12 project<br>
perpendicularly from their respective lids. The end of said portions 12 comprises<br>
an DLD shaped flange. The portion of the L-shaped flange 13 allows that when<br><br>
5<br>
at least one of the lids are opened, this flange 13 is retained by the rim of<br>
groove 10 preventing the iid to accidentally close again.  The closing may only<br>
be made when a minor force is inflicted from portion 12 to unlock the<br>
corresponding lid. As anyone skilled in the art shall be able to note, the lids<br>
locking are effected only when one of them is opened and the other is<br>
completely closed.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, it can be observed the difference in the areas<br>
between orifices 3 and 4 mentioned before. Principally, the difference is given<br>
in order to obtain at least two different flows of the liquid to be served<br>
according to the needs, as it will be explained hereinbelow. However, said<br>
difference between the pouring areas also allows that at the time of using any<br>
of the orifices to serve the liquid contained, the remaining orifice may be used<br>
as a air inlet path, thus allowing the liquid flow pouring through the chosen<br>
orifice to be constant and without interruptions or unwanted gurgling.<br>
Finally, it will be summarized an alternative use of the pour spout<br>
1, object of this invention, by making reference to all of the figures mentioned ;<br>
above. Accordingly, the pour spout 1 is arranged on a container holding the<br>
liquid as a part of it and not as a mere accessory, that is, said spout replaces<br>
the spouts commonly found in the art. As it is shown in FIG. 3, the spout 1 is in<br>
its original state, where lids 7 and 8 are closed. When a person wishes to use<br>
the liquid contained (which can be any liquid with different degrees of viscosity,<br><br>
6<br>
but preferably it is used for different types of oils), he/she shall choose the<br>
necessary liquid amount and the flow speed in which it must be served. That is,<br>
if the contained liquid is edible oil and the person needs a certain amount for<br>
the filling of a pot or saucepan to make a cooking -of any sort, then the person<br>
shall choose the orifice 3 in order to obtain a larger flow and thus filling the pot<br>
faster. As it was previously mentioned, if the contained liquid, at the time of<br>
being served, starts gurgling, the user may open the second and smaller lid to<br>
allow air to flow through the orifice 4 into the interior of the container and to<br>
allow a continued and constant flow of the liquid.<br>
On the other hand, if the person wishes to use a smaller liquid<br>
flow, it will only require to choose to open lid 12 corresponding to orifice 4, thus<br>
obtaining a reduced flow compared to the flow obtained by using orifice 3. As in<br>
the case of the previous paragraph, if the liquid flow starts gurgling or is slowly<br>
interrupted, the person shall only have to open lid 12 corresponding to orifice 3<br>
in order to allow the air to enter into of the container. Additionally, it is .<br>
important to note" that it is not necessary to open each lid 7 or 8 to choose the<br>
desired flow, since lids 7 or 8 dimensions are proportional to the size of orifices<br>
4 and 3 respectively.<br><br>
