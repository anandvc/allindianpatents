				<td>Electrical Switchgear<br>
Description<br>
The invention pertains to an electrical switchgear according to the introductory part of<br>
claim 1.<br>
We know of switchgears in which, for example, three heavy duty switch bars are fixed on<br>
a single supporting frame. An earthing switch is allocated to each of the heavy duty<br>
switch bars. The respective allocated heavy duty switch bar can be earthed with the help<br>
of the earthing switch. For this purpose the earthing switches have swivel contact arms<br>
that are in electrical contact with a terminal of the respective heavy duty switch bar in a<br>
switch-on position. In a switch-off position the contact arms are swivelled by about 90<br>
degrees around a swivel axis arranged in the region of the supporting frame. In the<br>
switch-off position one or more of the contact arms stand away towards the outside of the<br>
supporting frame.<br>
This has the disadvantage that the structural volume of the electrical switchgear is<br>
relatively large.<br>
It is the task of this invention to create an electrical switchgear with a reduced structural<br>
volume.<br>
The invention solves this task with an electrical switchgear according to claim 1.<br>
In the electrical switchgear as per the invention two heavy duty switch bars are foreseen,<br>
arranged beside one another on a supporting frame. Besides, there are also two earthing<br>
switches driven by a lever, which are allocated to both the heavy duty switch bars and<br>
meant for their electrical earthing. Each of the earthing switches has a swivel contact arm<br>
whose swivel axis is aligned almost vertical to the main stretching direction of the<br>
supporting frame. Both the contact arms fixed to the ends of the supporting frame can be<br>
swivelled by the lever in directions opposite to one another.<br><br>
On account of the swivel-ability of both the outer contact arms against one another it can<br>
be achieved that at no point of time the contact arms protrude outwards from the<br>
supporting frame. Even in the switch-off position of the contact arms, both the contact<br>
arms fixed at the ends of the supporting frame are swung inwards towards the supporting<br>
frame and hence do not significantly protrude outwards over the supporting frame.<br>
Hence, the required structural volume of the switchgear as per the invention is<br>
significantly lesser as compared to the stat-of-the-art technology.<br>
In an advantageous extension of the invention, the swivel axes of the contact arms are<br>
aligned almost horizontal. Thus the contact arms are arranged vertical in switch-on<br>
position and horizontal in switch-off position.<br>
In another advantageous extension of the invention the contact arms in switch-off<br>
position are arranged mainly in front of the supporting frame. Through this measure the<br>
required structural volume of the switchgear as per the invention gets further reduced.<br>
Each of the heavy duty switch bars has two terminals. In further advantageous extensions<br>
of the invention it can be foreseen that to each of the terminals a separate contact arm is<br>
allocated for earthing, without the same contact arm for earthing being allotted to both<br>
terminals.<br>
Further features, application possibilities and advantages of the invention can be obtained<br>
from the following description of design examples of the invention that are shown in the<br>
figures/diagrams. All described or depicted features by themselves or in any combination<br>
form the object of this invention, independent of their summarization in the patent claims<br>
or their reference, as well as independent of their formulation or depiction in the<br>
description or in the figures/diagrams.<br>
Figure 1 shows a schematic front view of a design example of the electrical switchgear as<br>
per the invention from the direction V of figure 2; figure 2 shows a schematic side view<br><br>
of the switchgear shown in figure 1 from the direction S of figure 1; figure 3 shows a<br>
schematic top view of the switchgear shown in figure 1 from the direction D of figure 1;<br>
and figure 4 shows a schematic perspective depiction of a design example of the lever of<br>
the switchgear shown in figure 1.<br>
Figures 1, 2 and 3 show a 3-phase electrical switchgear 10 that has a heavy duty switch<br>
bar 11 and an earthing switch 12 for each of the phases. The three heavy duty switch bars<br>
11 and the three earthing switches 12 are supported beside one another against a<br>
supporting frame 13 that can be erected on a floor with the help of two support bases 14.<br>
Each of the three heavy duty switch bars 11 is preferably designed of the same type. It<br>
could either be a known high voltage heavy duty switch or a known high voltage heavy<br>
duty switch with circuit breaker function particularly according to IEC 62271-108 or a<br>
known high voltage circuit breaker. Each of the three heavy duty switch bars 11 is mainly<br>
designed cylindrical and stands away from supporting frame 13 in almost vertical<br>
direction.<br>
Each of the three heavy duty switch bars 11 is provided with a first terminal 16 that is<br>
arranged somewhat at the centre of the heavy duty switch bar 11 and hence has a distance<br>
to the supporting frame 13, as well as with a second terminal 17 that is fixed to the free<br>
end of the heavy duty switch bar 11 and hence has a distance to the first terminal 16. In<br>
the region of the above mentioned distances there are insulators 18, in whose inner spaces<br>
further structural components of the heavy duty switch bar 11 are accommodated.<br>
One of the earthing switches 12 is allocated to each of the three heavy duty switch bars<br>
11. All three earthing switches 12 are electrically connected to the earth through the<br>
supporting frame 13 and the support bases 14. It is thereby possible that movable<br>
structural parts of the earthing switches 12 are electrically connected to the supporting<br>
frame 13 and /or the support bases 14 with the help of flexible earthing ropes or with the<br>
help of slide contacts. The three earthing switches 12 are similarly structured, which is<br>
why only one of the three earthing switches 12 is described in details further below.<br><br>
The earthing switch 12 has to do with a swivel contact arm 21 or 22 that can be swung to<br>
and fro between a switch-on position and a switch-off position by about 90 degrees. In<br>
the switch-on position, the terminal 16 of the heavy duty switch bar 11 is earthed through<br>
the corresponding earthing switch 12, whereas this is not the case in the switch-off<br>
position of the contact arm 21 or 22.<br>
The swivel axis of the contact arm 21 or 22 is arranged at the lower end of the<br>
corresponding heavy duty switch bar 11 in the region of the supporting frame. The<br>
supporting frame 13 has a longitudinal direction in which it mainly stretches. This<br>
represents the main extension direction of the supporting frame 13. The swivel axis of the<br>
three contact arms 21, 22 is aligned on the one hand vertical to this longitudinal direction<br>
or main extension direction. On the other hand, the swivel axis of the three contact arms<br>
21, 22 is aligned mainly vertical to the cylindrical axis of the respective corresponding<br>
heavy duty switch bar 11. If the heavy duty switch bars 11, as described, are mainly<br>
vertically aligned, then the swivel axes of the contact arms 21, 22 are mainly arranged<br>
horizontally. In figure 3 the swivel axis of one of the three contact arms 21 has been<br>
shown as dashed line and identified with the reference sign 20.<br>
In the switch-on position that is depicted in figure 1 with dashed line, the contact arm 21<br>
or 22 is aligned in vertical direction. The free end of the contact arm 21 or 22 is in<br>
electrical contact with the first terminal 16 of the corresponding heavy duty switch bar<br>
11. In the switch-off position that is depicted as continuous lines in figure 1, the contact<br>
arm 21 or 22 is arranged almost vertical. The free end of the contact arm 21 or 22 is not<br>
in electrical contact with any other structural part.<br>
The contact arm 21 arranged in figure 1 on the left side against the supporting frame 13<br>
swivels in the depiction in figure 1 from the switch-on position towards the right in<br>
clockwise direction to the switch-off position. This is indicated in figure 1 by a dashed<br>
quadrant 24. The same applies for the contact arm 21 arranged at the centre at the centre<br><br>
The drive 28 has a rotate-able drive shaft 31 that is aligned almost in vertical direction.<br>
At the free end of the shaft 31 there is a connecting lever 32 that can be swivelled on a<br>
horizontal plane. This connecting lever 32 is coupled through a connecting rod 33 to a<br>
lever 34 that is allocated to the central contact arm 21 and that can be swivelled on a<br>
vertical plane. This lever 34 is coupled through two rods 35, 36 with further levers 37, 38<br>
that are allocated to both the outer contact arms 21, 22 and that can similarly be swivelled<br>
on a vertical plane. The three already mentioned levers 34, 37, 38 are joined through<br>
respective corresponding shafts 39 to the contact arms 21, 22. The shafts 39 are supported<br>
within the supporting frame 13 and aligned horizontally.<br>
A rotation movement 41 of the drive shaft 31 in clockwise direction leads to a thrust<br>
movement 42 of the connecting rod 33 in the direction shown in figure 4. The resulting<br>
swivel movement of the connecting lever 32 on the horizontal plane is thereby converted<br>
into a swivel movement 43 of the lever 34 on a vertical plane. Through the rods 35, 36<br>
this swivel movement 43 is transmitted to the lever 37, 38. Both rods 37, 38 then execute<br>
thrust movements 44, 45 that are opposite to one another, as shown in figure 4. This<br>
results in the shafts 39 allocated to both outer contact arms 21, 22 executing swivel<br>
movements opposite to one another. In figure 4, the shaft 39 arranged on the left side<br>
executed the same swivel movement 43 as the central shaft in anticlockwise direction;<br>
however, the shaft 39 on the right side executes an opposite swivel movement 46 in<br>
clockwise direction. Through the shafts 39 the swivel movements 43, 46 are transmitted<br>
to the respective contact arms 21, 22. This results in both the outer contact arms 21, 22<br>
swivelling in directions opposite to one another.<br>
If the drive shaft 31 is rotated in anticlockwise direction, then this results in<br>
corresponding opposite movements of the described structural parts.<br>
The earthing switches 12 in figures 1 to 4 can also be designed as so called swivel-thrust-<br>
earthing switch. This means that the earthing switches are first swivelled as described in a<br>
vertical direction in order to execute a thrust movement in this vertical direction. With<br><br>
this thrust movement the contact arms 21, 22 of the earthing switch dip into ring-shaped<br>
or similarly designed contact pieces that stand away from the terminals 16. In this way a<br>
safe electrical contact is established between the contact arms 21, 22 and the terminals 16<br>
that stays intact even at forces occurring at higher currents.<br>
It is further possible to even earth the second terminals 17 of the heavy duty switch bars<br>
11. For this, a further lever can be provided on the rear side of the supporting frame 13,<br>
which is coupled with additional contact arms. These contact arms can then be swung<br>
into a switch-on position, in which the second terminals 17 are earthed separately and<br>
independent of the first terminals 16. Similarly, the contact arms 21, 22 explained on the<br>
basis of figures 1 to 4 can be designed longer than depicted, so that they can earth not<br>
only the first terminals 16 but also simultaneously the second terminals 17. In both cases,<br>
by appropriately selecting the horizontal distance and the vertical height of the heavy<br>
duty switch bar, it can be achieved that the central contact arm 21 is arranged<br>
significantly in front of the supporting frame 13 even in switch-off position and hence<br>
largely in the region of the switchgear 10.<br>
It is also possible that a mechanical locking is foreseen between the heavy duty switch<br>
bars 11 and the earthing switches 12. This locking could, for example, be designed in<br>
such a way that the earthing switch 12 can be moved into the switch-on position only<br>
when the heavy duty switch bars 11 are electrically open, and/or that the heavy duty<br>
switch bars 11 can be electrically closed only when the earthing switches 12 are in their<br>
switch-off position.<br>
Alternatively it is possible that the common drive 28 shown in figures 1 to 4 is replaced<br>
for all three earthing switches 12 by three separate drives that are allocated to the<br>
respective earthing switches 12. It is further pointed out that the heavy duty switch bars<br>
11 are coupled with a drive that is allocated to the supporting frame 13. One could either<br>
have a common drive for all three heavy duty switch bars 12 or individual drives for the<br>
respective heavy duty switch bars 12.<br><br>
