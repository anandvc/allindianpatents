SPECIFICATION NONAQUEOUS ELECTROLYTE SOLUTION AND LITHIUM SECONDARY<br>
BATTERY USING SAME<br><br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a nonaqueous electrolytic solution that can produce a lithium secondary battery exhibiting excellent battery characteristics, such as electrical capacity, cycle property and storage property, and to a lithium secondary battery using the nonaqueous electrolytic solution.<br>
Background Art [0002]<br>
In recent years, lithium secondary batteries have been widely used as driving power supplies for small electronic devices and the like.  Such lithium secondary batteries are mainly constituted of a positive electrode comprised of a lithium compound oxide, a negative electrode comprised of a carbon material or a lithium metal, and a nonaqueous electrolytic solution. As the nonaqueous electrolytic solution, carbonates such as ethylene carbonate (EC) and propylene carbonate (PC) are used.<br>
A lithium secondary battery using, for example, LiCo02, LiMn204 or LiNi02 as a positive electrode material brings about a reduction of the battery performance, when part of the solvent of the nonaqueous electrolytic solution locally undergoes an oxidative decomposition during the charging,<br><br>
because the decomposition products inhibit the desired electrochemical reaction of the battery.  Such a reduction is considered to be attributed to an electrochemical oxidation of the solvent at the interface between the positive electrode<br><br>
Also, a lithium secondary battery using, for example, a highly crystallized carbon material, such as natural graphite or artificial graphite, as a negative electrode material brings about a reduction of the battery performance, when the solvent of the nonaqueous electrolytic solution undergoes a reductive decomposition on the surface of the negative electrode during the charging. Even in the case of EC, which is widely used as a solvent for the nonaqueous electrolytic solution, it partly undergoes reductive decomposition during repeated charging and discharging cycles, resulting in reduction of the battery performance.<br>
Particularly, decomposition of the nonaqueous electrolytic solution on the positive electrode and the negative electrode causes gas generation, which leads to expansion of the battery and impairs mobility of lithium ions as a result of trapping of the gas between the electrodes, thereby reducing the battery performance. [0003]<br>
Techniques for improving the battery characteristics of such lithium secondary batteries are known, for example, in Patent Documents 1 to 5.  Patent Document 1 discloses a nonaqueous electrolytic solution containing 0.05% to 10% by volume of glycol sulfite (also referred to as ethylene sulfite) as a cyclic sulfite.  However, this document<br><br>
does not describe the retention of capacity at high temperatures.<br>
Patent Document 2 discloses a nonaqueous electrolytic solution containing erythritan sulfite as a<br><br>
merely 3 cycles are tested, and cycle property, for example, after 100 cycles is not evaluated.  This document also does not describe cycle property in a high-temperature environment.<br>
Patent Document 3 discloses a nonaqueous electrolytic solution containing ethylene sulfite, erythritan sulfite and the like to improve cycle property. However, this nonaqueous electrolytic solution exhibits a low charging and discharging efficiency and insufficient characteristics in a high-temperature environment.<br>
Patent Document 4 discloses a nonaqueous electrolytic solution containing ethylene sulfite and vinylene carbonate.  In an optimum Example, this document describes that the retention of capacity after 100 cycles at 45Â°C is 90.0%.  However, a nonaqueous electrolytic solution having a higher retention of capacity is still desired.<br>
Patent Document 5 discloses a nonaqueous electrolytic solution containing l,3,2-dioxathiolane-2,2-dioxide and the like as a sulfate compound for lithium secondary batteries and describes excellent storage property of the battery which is left to stand at high temperatures in a charged state.  In this nonaqueous electrolytic solution, the battery characteristics are<br><br>
improved to some extent but are still far from satisfaction. Nonaqueous electrolytic solutions and lithium secondary batteries having further improved characteristics are needed.<br><br>

Furthermore, the upper limit of the content of the compound is preferably 10% by volume or less, more preferably 5% by volume or less, and most preferably 3% by volume or less.<br>
A content of 1,3-propane suitone of less than 0.1% by volume on the basis of the volume of the nonaqueous electrolytic solution reduces the effect of addition.

The proportion of cyclic carbonates and linear carbonates is preferably determined such that the volume ratio of cyclic carbonates to linear carbonates ranges from 10:90 to 40:60, more preferably from 20:80 to 40:60, and most preferably from 25:75 to 35:65. [0043] [Electrolyte Salts]<br>
Examples of electrolyte salts used in the present invention include lithium salts such as LiPF6/ LiBF4, and LiClCu; alkyl-containing lithium salts such as LiN(S02CF3) 2,<br><br>

preferred are LiPF6, LiBF4, and LiN (S02CF3) 2.  The most preferred electrolyte salt is LiPF6.  These electrolyte salts may be used alone or in combination. [0044]<br>
Examples of preferred combinations of these electrolyte salts include a combination of LiPF6 and LiBF4, a combination of LiPF6 and LiN (S02CF3) 2, and a combination of LiBF4 and LiN (S02CF3) 2.  Particularly preferred is a combination of LiPF6 and LiBF4. A proportion of LiPF6 below the level of the molar ratio of LiPF6 to LiBF4 of 80:20 or at a proportion of LiPF6 above the level of the molar ratio of LiPF6 to LiBF4 of 99:1 may impair cycle property. Therefore, the molar ratio of LiPF6 to LiBF4 preferably ranges from 80:20 to 99:1 and more preferably from 90:10 to 98:2.<br>
The electrolyte salts can be mixed at any ratio.  In the case of a combined use of any other electrolyte salt with LiPF6, a proportion (molar ratio) of the other electrolyte salt of less than 0.01 % on the basis of the total amount of the electrolyte salts may not significantly improve storage property at high temperatures. A proportion of the salt of more than 45 % may impair storage property at high temperatures.  Therefore, the proportion (molar ratio) of the compounds desirably ranges from 0.01% to 45%, preferably from 0.03% to 20%, more preferably from 0.05% to 10%, and most<br><br>
preferably from 0.05% to 5%.<br>

causing decreased productivity. [0046]<br>
Incorporation of, for example, air or carbon dioxide in the nonaqueous electrolytic solution of the present invention<br><br>
electrolytic solution and can improve battery characteristics such as long-term cycle property and charging and storage property.<br>
Methods for incorporating (dissolving) air or carbon dioxide in the nonaqueous electrolytic solution include (1) bringing the nonaqueous electrolytic solution into contact with air or carbon dioxide-containing gas before the solution is fed into a battery; or (2) feeding the solution into a battery and then incorporating air or carbon dioxide-containing gas in the solution before or after the battery is sealed.  It is preferred that the air or carbon dioxide-containing gas contain moisture as little as possible and have a dew point of -40CC or below, and more preferably -50Â°C or below.<br>
In the present invention, use of a nonaqueous electrolytic solution containing dissolved carbon dioxide is<br>
particularly preferred in order to improve charging and discharging characteristics at high temperatures. The amount of dissolved carbon dioxide is desirably 0.001% by weight or more, preferably 0.05% by weight or more, and more preferably 0.2% by weight or more. A nonaqueous electrolytic solution containing saturated carbon dioxide is most preferred. [0047]<br>
The nonaqueous electrolytic solution of the present<br><br>
invention may further contain an aromatic compound to enhance the safety of overcharged batteries.<br>
Examples of such aromatic compounds include the following groups (a) to (c) :<br><br>

A total content of the aromatic compound of less than 0.1% by weight on the basis of the weight of the nonaqueous electrolytic solution may not effectively prevent overcharging. A total content of the compound of more than 5% by weight may impair cycle property. Therefore, the total content of the compound preferably ranges from 0.1% to 5% by weight. [0048]<br><br>
[Lithium Secondary Battery]<br>
The lithium secondary battery of the present invention comprises a positive electrode, a negative electrode, and a nonaqueous electrolytic solution in which an electrolyte salt<br><br>
as a positive electrode and a negative electrode, other than the nonaqueous electrolytic solution can be used without limitation.<br>
For example, usable positive electrode active materials include complex metal oxides of lithium with cobalt, manganese, or nickel.  Such positive electrode active materials may be used alone or in combination.<br>
Examples of such lithium-containing complex metal oxides include LiCo02, LiMn204, LiNi02, LiCoi-xNix02 (0.01<x licoi linii and licoo.9emgo.02o2. these oxides may be used in a combination of for example lico02 limn204 lini02 or lini02.></x>
An element of the lithium-containing complex oxides may be partly substituted by any other element to improve safety or cycle property of overcharged batteries and to enable the batteries to be used at a charging potential of 4.3 V or more. For example, part of cobalt, manganese, or nickel may preferably be substituted by at least one element selected from the group consisting of Sn,. Mg, Fe, Ti, Al, Zr, Cr, V, Ga, Zn, Cu, Bi, Mo, and La.  Part of 0 may preferably be substituted by S or F. Alternatively, the lithium-containing complex oxides are preferably coated with a compound containing these substituent elements.<br><br>
Among these, preferably used are lithium-containing complex metal oxides, such as LiCo02, LiMn204, and LiNi02, which can be used at a charging potential of the positive electrode 4.3 V or higher with reference to Li in a fully<br><br>
as LiCoi-xMx02 (where M represents at least one element selected from the group consisting of Sn, Mg, Fe, Ti, Al, Zr, Cr, V, Ga,<br>

As a positive electrode active material, lithium-containing olivine phosphates may be also used. Specific examples of such phosphates include LiFeP04/ LiCoP04, LiNiP04, LiMnP04, and LiFei-xMxP04 (where M represents at least one element selected from the group consisting of Co, Ni, Mn, Cu, Zn, and Cd and x is 0<x among these lifep04 or licop04 is particularly preferred as a positive electrode active material for high-voltage use.></x>
The lithium-containing olivine phosphate may be used in the form of a mixture with any other positive electrode active material. [0051]<br>
The conductive material for the positive electrode may be any electron conductive material which does not undergo a chemical change. Examples of such conductive materials include graphites, for example, natural graphite (flake graphite) and artificial graphite, and carbon blacks, for example, acetylene black, ketjen black, channel black, furnace<br><br>
black, lamp black, and thermal black.  The graphites and the carbon blacks may be used as an appropriate mixture.  The amount of the conductive material added to a positive electrode mixture preferably ranges from 1% to 10% by weight<br><br>
[0052]<br>
The positive electrode may be prepared by mixing a positive electrode active material, a conductive material such as acetylene black or carbon black, and a binder such as polytetrafluoroethylene, polyvinylidene fluoride, a styrene-butadiene copolymer, an acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer, carboxymethyl cellulose, and an ethylene-propylene-diene terpolymer, kneading the mixture with a high-boiling point solvent such as l-methyl-2-pyrrolidone to prepare a positive electrode mixture, then rolling the resulting positive electrode material on a collector such as an aluminum foil or a lath board made of stainless steel, and then heating the resulting assembly at a temperature in the range of 50Â°C to 250Â°C for about 2 hours under vacuum. [0053]<br>
Usable materials for the negative electrode (negative electrode active materials) include lithium metal, lithium alloys, carbon materials that can intercalate and deintercalate lithium (thermally decomposed carbon materials, cokes, graphites (such as artificial graphite and natural graphite), fired organic polymer compounds, and carbon fibers), tin, a tin compound, silicon, and a silicon compound. These materials may be used singly or in combination of two or more thereof.<br><br>
Among these, carbon materials are preferred. More preferred are carbon materials which have a graphite crystal structure having a lattice spacing (doo2) of the lattice face (002) of 0.340 nm or less and particularly in the range of<br><br>
that have lower crystallinity than the carbon material described above can enhance the effect of addition of 1,2-cyclohexanediol cyclic sulfite, 1,2-cyclohexanediol cyclic carbonate, hexahydro-1,3,2-benzodioxathiol-2,2-dioxide, and 1,2-cyclohexanediol derivatives represented by the general formula (X), it is particularly preferred that the surface of the carbon material having a graphite crystal structure is partly or completely coated with this low-crystallinity carbon material.  The state of the surface coating with the low-crystallinity carbon material can be detected by the observation of a cross section of the carbon material with a transmission electron microscope.<br>
Tin, tin compounds, silicon, and silicon compounds are also preferred because these compounds can enhance the battery capacity.<br>
The negative electrode may be prepared using the same binder and the same high-boiling-point solvent as in the method of preparing the positive electrode. [0054]<br>
In the present invention, it is preferable to increase the density of the electrode mixture for the battery in order to enhance the effect of addition of at least one compound selected from the group consisting of 1,2-cyclohexanediol cyclic sulfite, 1,2-cyclohexanediol<br><br>
cyclic carbonate, hexahydro-l,3,2-benzodioxathiol-2,2-dioxide, and 1,2-cyclohexanediol derivatives represented by the general formula (X) .  In particular, the density of the positive electrode (positive electrode mixture layer)<br><br>
more preferably 3.3 g/cm3 or more, and most preferably 3.4 g/cm3 or more. The upper limit of the density of the positive electrode exceeding 4.0 g/cm3 may not readily prepare the positive electrode mixture layer in some cases. Therefore, the density of the positive electrode is preferably 4.0 g/cm3 or lower, more preferably 3.9 g/cm3 or lower, and most preferably 3.8 g/cm3 or lower.<br>
The density of the negative electrode (negative electrode mixture layer) formed on a copper foil is preferably 1.3 g/cm3 or more, more preferably 1.4 g/cm3 or more, and most preferably 1.5 g/cm3 or more. The upper limit of the density of the negative electrode exceeding 2.0 g/cm3 may not readily prepare the negative electrode mixture layer in some cases. Therefore, the density of the negative electrode is preferably 2.0 g/cm3 or lower, more preferably 1.9 g/cm3 or lower, and most preferably 1.8 g/cm3 or lower. [0055]<br>
A significantly small thickness of the electrode layer of the positive electrode (for one side of the collector) may lead to a reduction in the amount of the active material in the electrode material layer and thus a reduction in the battery capacity. Thus, the thickness of the electrode layer of the positive electrode is preferably 30 jam or more and more preferably 50 \na  or more.  A significantly large<br><br>
thickness of the electrode material layer may lead to undesirable deterioration of cycle property of charge and discharge and rate characteristics. Therefore, the thickness of the electrode layer of the positive electrode is preferably<br><br>
A significantly small thickness of the electrode layer of the negative electrode (for one side of the collector) may lead to a reduction in the amount of the active material in the electrode material layer and thus a reduction in the battery capacity. Thus, the thickness of the electrode layer of the negative electrode is preferably 1 |o,m or more and more preferably 3 |im or more.  A significantly large thickness of the electrode layer of the negative electrode may lead to undesirable reductions in cycle property of charge and discharge and rate characteristics. Therefore, the thickness of the electrode layer of the negative electrode is<br>
preferably 100 p,m or lower and more preferably 70 \xm  or lower. [0056]<br>
The lithium secondary battery can have any structure without restriction. The secondary battery may be a coin-shaped battery, a cylindrical battery, a square-shaped battery, or a laminate-type battery, each having a single layered or multi-layered separator.<br>
The battery separator may be composed of a single layered or laminated porous film, woven fabric, or non-woven fabric of a polyolefin such as polypropylene or polyethylene.<br>
A separator having a significantly high Gurley value (air permeability) may lead to a reduction in lithium ion conductivity and thus does not sufficiently function as a<br><br>
battery separator, although it depends on fabrication conditions.  Therefore, the Gurley value is preferably 1000 seconds/100 cc or lower, more preferably 800 seconds/100 cc  or lower, and most preferably 500 seconds/100 cc  or lower. A<br><br>
lead to low mechanical strength. Therefore, the Gurley value is preferably 50 seconds/100 cc or more, more preferably 100 seconds/100 cc  or more, and most preferably 300 seconds/100 cc   or more.  The porosity of the separator preferably ranges from 30% to 60%, more preferably from 35% to 55%, and most preferably from 40% to 50%, from the viewpoint of improvements in capacity characteristics of the battery.<br>
Furthermore, a higher energy density is achieved by a smaller thickness of the separator. Thus, the thickness of the battery separator is preferably 50 Jim or less, more<br>
preferably 40 jam or less, and most preferably 25 (am or less. Also, in order to ensure sufficient mechanical strength, the<br>
thickness of the battery separator is preferably 5 jam or more, more preferably 10 (im or more, and most preferably 15 \im  or more . [0057]<br>
The lithium secondary battery of the present invention exhibits excellent long-term cycle property even when the final charging voltage is 4.2 V or higher and particularly 4.3 V or higher. Furthermore, the cycle property are favorable even when the final charging voltage is 4.4 V.  The final discharging voltage can be set to 2.5 V or more and preferably 2.8 V or more. Although the current value is not restricted, a constant current discharge of 0.1C to 3C is<br><br>
generally employed.  The lithium secondary battery of the present invention may be charged and discharged at -40Â°C to 100Â°C and preferably 0Â°C to 80Â°C.<br>
[0058]<br><br>
provided with a relief valve, as a countermeasure against an increase in internal pressure of the lithium secondary battery. Alternatively, a cutout may be provided in a battery component such as a battery can or a gasket.<br>
In the lithium secondary battery of the present invention, a plurality of lithium secondary batteries may be accommodated in a battery pack in series and/or in parallel, as necessary.  The battery pack can be provided with an overcurrent circuit breaker, such as a PTC element, a thermal fuse, or a bimetal, as well as a safety circuit (a circuit that can monitor the voltage, the temperature, and the current of each battery and/or the entire battery pack, and can shut off the current, as necessary).<br>

It should be noted, however, that the present invention is not limited to these Examples and includes various combinations easily deduced from the gist of the invention.  In particular, the combinations of solvents in the following Examples should not be limited to these examples.<br><br>

This mixture was mixed with l-methyl-2-pyrrolidone as a solvent.  The resulting mixture was applied onto an aluminum foil, was dried, was compression-molded, and was heated to prepare a positive electrode. Aside from this, 95% by weight of artificial graphite (negative electrode active material) which had a graphite crystal structure having a lattice spacing (d002) of the lattice face (002) of 0.335 run was mixed with 5% by weight of polyvinylidene fluoride<br>

The resulting mixture was applied onto a copper foil, was dried, was compression-molded, and was heated to prepare a negative electrode. A cylindrical battery of 18650 size (diameter: 18 mm, height: 65 mm) was then fabricated with a microporous polypropylene film separator. The nonaqueous electrolytic solution was poured, and then carbon dioxide having a dew point of -60Â°C was incorporated before the battery was sealed.

The charging was further continued for 3 hours in total at a constant final voltage of 4.3 V. Next, the battery was discharged at a constant electric current of 2.2 A (1 C) down to a final voltage of 2.8 V. This charge-discharge cycle was repeated. The initial charge-discharge capacity was nearly equal to that of a case (Comparative Example 1) where 1% of ethylene sulfite was added instead of the sulfite compound of the present invention and 1M LiPF6 having a proportion (volume basis) of EC:VC:MEC of 30:2:68 was used as a nonaqueous electrolytic solution. The battery characteristics after 200 cycles were measured. The discharge capacity retention was 81%, of the initial discharge capacity (100%).

The nonaqueous solvent, the electrolyte salts, and the sulfate compound used had been preliminarily purified. [0074] [Preparation of Lithium Secondary Battery]<br>
LiCoi/3Nii/3Mni/302 (90% by weight) as a positive electrode active material, acetylene black (5% by weight) as a conductive material, and polyvinylidene fluoride (5% by weight) as a binder were mixed. This mixture was mixed with l-methyl-2-pyrrolidone as a solvent. The resulting mixture was applied onto an aluminum foil, was dried, was compression-molded, and was heated to prepare a positive electrode.  Aside from this, 95% by weight of artificial graphite (negative electrode active material) which had a graphite crystal structure having a lattice spacing (doo2) of the lattice, face (002) of 0.335 nm were mixed with 5% by weight of polyvinylidene fluoride (binder).  The mixture was mixed with l-methyl-2-pyrrolidone as a solvent. The resulting mixture was applied onto a copper foil, was dried, was compression-<br><br>
