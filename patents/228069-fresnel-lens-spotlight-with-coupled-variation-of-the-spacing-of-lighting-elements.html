				<td>Fresnel lens spotlight with coupled variation of the spacing<br>
of lighting elements<br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to a Fresnel lens spotlight with an<br>
adjustable aperture angle of the emergent light bundle,<br>
having a reflector, a lamp and at least one Fresnel lens.<br>
In the case of conventional Fresnel lens spotlights, the part<br>
of relevance to the lighting generally comprise a lamp, a<br>
Fresnel lens and a spherical auxiliary reflector. The lamp<br>
filament is conventionally located substantially invariably<br>
at the center of the spherical reflector. Consequently, a<br>
portion of the light emitted by the lamp is retroreflected<br>
into the latter and supports the emission of light into the<br>
front half space. This light directed forwards is focused by<br>
the Fresnel lens. The degree of optical focusing is, however,<br>
a function of the spacing between the Fresnel lens and the<br>
lamp. The narrowest optical focusing occurs when the lamp<br>
filament is located at the focal point of the Fresnel lens.<br>
This results in a quasi-parallel beam path, also termed spot.<br>
By shortening the spacing between the Fresnel lens and the<br>
lamp, the aperture angle of the emergent light beam is<br>
continuously enlarged. This results in a diverging beam path<br>
which is also termed flood. However, a disadvantage of such<br>
spotlights is the poor light yield, particularly at their<br>
spot position, since here the Fresnel lens covers only a<br>
comparatively small solid angle range of the lamp. Moreover,<br>
it is disadvantageous that a large proportion of the light<br><br>
reflected by the spherical reflector strikes the lamp<br>
filament itself again, is absorbed there and additionally<br>
heats up the lamp filament.<br>
DE 39 19 643 A1 discloses a spotlight having a reflector, a<br>
diaphragm and a Fresnel lens. The illumination of the<br>
spotlight is varied by adjusting the light source. A change<br>
in brightness of the light is effected thereby. The<br>
brightness is controlled by controlling the distance between<br>
the vertex point and reflector and between the diaphragm and<br>
the reflector.<br>
DE 34 13 310 Al discloses a spotlight having a lamp and a<br>
reflector or a lamp and a composite lens. The spotlight<br>
further has a diffusing screen or a mirror that are both<br>
positioned at an angle of 45°. The mirror deflects the light,<br>
and the diffusing screen scatters the light. Different<br>
emission angles of the light bundle are produced by<br>
displacing the diffusing screen.<br>
DE 101 13 385 C1 describes a Fresnel lens spotlight lens in<br>
which the Fresnel lens is a composite lens whose focal point<br>
on the light source side is located at the spot position<br>
approximately at the focal point of the ellipsoid reflector<br>
that is remote from the reflector. In this way, the lamp is<br>
not unnecessarily heated by retroreflected light. However,<br>
with increasing miniaturization of the light source, for<br>
example in the case of high-power high-pressure discharge<br>
lamps, it is possible for there to occur in the illuminated<br>
light field a middle dark area that is ever more strongly<br>
pronounced and cannot be compensated for, or can be<br>
compensated for only with large light losses, by means of<br>
diffusing devices. Even the conventional diffusing devices<br>
used to avoid imaging of the emission center of the light<br>
source provide only a partial remedy here, if at all, since<br><br>
at least the dark middle acceptance cone must also be<br>
homogeneously illuminated in this case in each position of<br>
the Fresnel lens spotlight. However, it is precisely thereby<br>
that large light losses come about at the spot position, in<br>
particular, since here only a dark area with a very small<br>
aperture angle is present, whereas in the case of the<br>
conventional Fresnel lenses with diffusing devices the entire<br>
area of the Fresnel lens is used nevertheless to diffuse the<br>
light field.<br>
The aim of the invention is to provide a Fresnel lens<br>
spotlight that provides a homogeneously illuminated light<br>
field in conjunction with a high efficiency.<br>
This object is achieved in a surprisingly simple way with the<br>
aid of a Fresnel spotlight in accordance with claim 1, and of<br>
an illumination set in accordance with claim 19.<br>
The inventors have discovered that these high light losses<br>
can be avoided in a surprisingly simple way with the aid of a<br>
diffusing screen. It is particularly advantageous in this<br>
case if the Fresnel lens has a diffusing screen that, in a<br>
particularly preferred way, is of circular design and<br>
arranged only in the center of the Fresnel lens.<br>
In this embodiment, the dark areas in the middle of the<br>
illumination field can be very effectively avoided in any<br>
position of the Fresnel lens spotlight, but the high light<br>
losses in the spot position of the reflector no longer occur.<br>
It emerges in a surprising way that, in terms of geometrical<br>
optics, the beam path of the light emerging from the<br>
reflector illuminates a smaller area at the location of the<br>
Fresnel lens precisely when the required fraction of<br>
scattered light is increased.<br><br>
This effect has been exploited by the inventors in order to<br>
provide by means of the invention an automatic or adaptive<br>
light mixing system that, in addition to the light imaged by<br>
geometrical optics mixes synchronously with the adjustment o<br>
the Fresnel lens spotlight only that fraction of scattered<br>
light that is required for this position.<br>
This light mixing ratio, which can be adapted virtually<br>
optimally to the light distributions respectively required,<br>
will be denoted below for short only as the mixing ratio.<br>
For essentially every position of the reflector, this<br>
automatic light mixing system produces the correct mixing<br>
ratio and thus always a very homogeneously illuminated light<br>
field, but without unnecessary scattering losses occurring<br>
thereby.<br>
The selection of the diameter of the diffusing screen in<br>
relation to the remaining area of the Fresnel lens can in<br>
this case be used to define the mixing ratio of the Fresnel<br>
lens illuminated over its entire area, and the aperture angl<br>
of the scattered light can be defined by the scattering<br>
properties of the Fresnel lens.<br>
Furthermore, the scattering action on the integrated<br>
diffusing screen itself can vary such that, for example, more<br>
strongly scattering areas are arranged in the middle of the<br>
diffusing screen, and less strongly scattering regions are<br>
arranged at the edge thereof. This has the effect of<br>
additionally further expanding a strongly focused beam<br>
bundle, and extremely wide illumination angles can then be<br>
implemented.<br><br>
Alternatively, the edge of the diffusing screen can not only<br>
also be configured to end abruptly, but it can be fashioned<br>
to have a continuously decreasing scattering effect, and also<br>
to extend under or over the Fresnel lens. Further adaptations<br>
to the mixing ratios, which are a function of position, can<br>
be undertaken thereby.<br>
In the case of the preferred embodiments, the diffusing<br>
screen can be arranged both on the light entrance side and on<br>
the light exit side. Furthermore, there is the advantageous<br>
possibility of arranging diffusing screens on the light<br>
entrance side and on the light exit side. In the case of this<br>
last-named embodiment, it is also possible to use diffusing<br>
screens that scatter differently, for example spatially<br>
differently.<br>
Reference may be made to the application, filed on the same<br>
day, of the same applicant under the title of „Optische<br>
Anordnung mit Stufenlinse" [„Optical arrangement with a<br>
Fresnel lens"] , the disclosure content of which is also fully<br>
incorporated in the disclosure content of the present<br>
application by reference.<br>
At the same time, the uniformity of the illumination level in<br>
the entire light field is maintained, as illustrated by way<br>
of example in figure 6 both for the spot position and for the<br>
flood position.<br>
According to the invention, an ellipsoidal reflector with a<br>
large aperture is provided. The spot position is adjusted by<br>
virtue of the fact that the lamp filament of a black body<br>
radiator, in particular a halogen lamp, or the discharge arc<br>
of a discharge lamp is located at the focal point of the<br>
ellipsoid on the reflector side, and the second focal point<br>
of the ellipsoid, remote from the reflector, is arranged<br><br>
approximately at the real focal point, near the reflector, of<br>
the Fresnel lens.<br>
The light reflected by the reflector is focused virtually<br>
completely onto the focal point of the ellipsoid remote from<br>
the reflector before entering the Fresnel lens. The lamp<br>
filament, or the discharge arc, located at the focal point of<br>
the Fresnel lens on the reflector side is imaged at infinity<br>
after passing through the Fresnel lens, and its light is<br>
thereby converted into a virtually parallel beam.<br>
Given an expedient selection of the aperture angle of the<br>
reflector and Fresnel lens, the light reflected by the<br>
reflector is virtually completely picked up by the Fresnel<br>
lens and radiated forwards as a narrow spotlight bundle.<br>
The aperture angle of the light bundle emerging from the<br>
Fresnel lens can be virtually arbitrarily enlarged in the<br>
case of a first embodiment by suitably varying the lamp<br>
position with reference to the reflector, on the one hand,<br>
and the spacing of the Fresnel lens from the reflector, on<br>
the other hand.<br>
It is thereby possible to retain the good properties of<br>
conventional Fresnel lens spotlights with reference to the<br>
uniformity of the illumination level, should these variations<br>
in the spacing result from an expediently selected positive<br>
coupling.<br>
One embodiment of the invention consists in that the<br>
ellipsoidal reflector consists of a metallic or a transparert<br>
dielectric material. It is preferred to use as dielectric<br>
materials glass and polymer materials or plastics that can be<br>
coated with metal, for example aluminum.<br><br>
Alternatively, or in addition, in one embodiment with a<br>
transparent dielectric material one of the two or both<br>
surfaces of the reflector is/are provided with a system of<br>
optically thin layers in order to produce a reflecting<br>
surface. The coating of the Fresnel lens advantageously<br>
comprises a dielectric interference layer system that varies<br>
the spectrum of the light passing through. It is thereby<br>
advantageously possible for visible radiation components to<br>
be reflected, and for the invisible components, in particular<br>
thermal radiation components, to be passed.<br>
In general, both the reflector, the Fresnel lens and/or the<br>
diffusing screen can be coated on at least one side, for<br>
example they can be coated in the case of plastic with a<br>
nonscratch and/or nonreflecting layer.<br>
A further preferred embodiment of the invention comprises a<br>
metallic coating on one or both principal surfaces of the<br>
reflector.<br>
In a further alternative refinement, the reflector can also<br>
be a metallic reflector that can both be uncoated and be<br>
coated with dielectric or metal, in order to provide the<br>
desired spectral and corrosion properties.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the invention comprises a Fresnel<br>
lens spotlight in the case of which the light-reflecting<br>
surface of the reflector, preferably having partial areas or<br>
facets, is patterned to scatter light, and no, or one or two<br>
surface of the Fresnel lens are structure in a light-<br>
scattering fashion. This produces a fixed fraction of the<br>
superimposition of scattered light relative to light imaged<br>
by geometrical optics, which can reduce dark rings in the<br>
light field.<br><br>
The Fresnel lens is advantageously toughened, preferably<br>
thermally toughened, at its surface in order in such a way to<br>
exhibit a higher level of strength and resistance to thermal<br>
loading.<br>
The invention provides for the use of the spotlight for<br>
architecture, medicine, film, stage, studio and photography,<br>
as well as in a pocket lamp.<br>
In the preferred embodiments, the diffusing screen can be<br>
arranged both on the light entrance side and on the light<br>
exit side. Furthermore, there is the advantageous possibility<br>
of arranging diffusing screens on the light entrance side and<br>
on the light exit side. It is also possible in the case of<br>
the lastmentioned embodiment to use differently scattering<br>
diffusing screens, for example ones that scatter differently<br>
spatially.<br>
The invention will be described in more detail with the aid<br>
of preferred embodiments and with reference to the attached<br>
drawings, in which:<br>

Detailed description of preferred embodiments<br>
It is assumed in the following detailed description that<br>
identical reference symbols denote identical or identically<br>
acting elements in the various respective embodiments.<br>
Reference is made below to figure 1, which shows an<br>
embodiment of the Fresnel lens spotlight in spot position.<br>
The Fresnel lens spotlight essentially includes an<br>
ellipsoidal reflector 1, a lamp 2 that can be an incandescent<br>
lamp, particularly a halogen lamp, a light-emitting diode, a<br>
light-emitting diode array or a gas discharge lamp, and a<br>
Fresnel lens 3 that is a positive lens, preferably a<br>
planoconvex Fresnel lens.<br><br>
In figure 1, the focal point F2 of the ellipsoidal reflector<br>
1 remote from the reflector is superimposed somewhat by the<br>
left-hand side real or positive focal point F3 of the Fresnel<br>
lens 3.<br>
The light bundle 4 emerging from the spotlight is indicated<br>
in the figures only schematically by the outer edge beams<br>
thereof.<br>
The spacings a between the Fresnel lens 3 and front edge of<br>
the reflector 1, and b between the lamp 2 and vertex point of<br>
the reflector 1 are likewise illustrated in figure 1.<br>
The spot position is set by virtue of the fact that the lamp<br>
filament or the discharge arc of the lamp 2 is arranged<br>
essentially at the focal point F1 of the reflector ellipsoid<br>
1 on the reflector side.<br>
The light reflected by the reflector 1 is directed in this<br>
position virtually completely onto the focal point F2 of the<br>
ellipsoid 1 remote from the reflector. The left-hand side<br>
positive or real focal point F3 of the Fresnel lens 3 then<br>
coincides approximately with the focal length F2 of the<br>
reflector ellipsoid.<br>
It is also to be seen in the near field in figure 1 how the<br>
aperture 5 within the reflector 2 acts as a dark area 6 in<br>
the parallel beam path of the light field 4.<br>
Provided within the Fresnel lens 3 is a circular, centrally<br>
arranged diffusing screen 7 that produces a defined scattered<br>
light ratio and a defined aperture angle of the scattered<br>
light. The result of this is to provide a defined mixing<br>
ratio of the scattered light relative to the light imaged by<br><br>
geometric optics by the Fresnel lens 3.<br>
As an alternative to this embodiment of the diffusing screen<br>
7, in a further embodiment the scattering action changes<br>
along the radius of the diffusing screen 7 steadily in such a<br>
way that more strongly scattering areas are arranged in the<br>
middle of the diffusing screen 7, and less strongly<br>
scattering areas are arranged at the abruptly ending edge<br>
thereof.<br>
In yet a further alternative refinement, the edge of the<br>
diffusing screen 7 not only ends abruptly, but it is<br>
constructed such that its scattering action decreases<br>
steadily, and it can also extend below or above the Fresnel<br>
lens .<br>
Further adaptations to the mixing ratios, which depend on<br>
position, are thereby taken as a function of the system such<br>
that the person skilled in the art can always provide an<br>
optimum mixing ratio for a homogeneously illuminated light<br>
field, or also for light fields with locally higher<br>
intensities produced in a defined fashion.<br>
It may also be seen from figure 1 that in the spot position<br>
only a small portion of the total light passes through the<br>
diffusing screen 7.<br>
A very homogeneous illumination results from the diffusing<br>
screen 7, as reproduced for the spot position with the line 8<br>
in figure 6, which shows a logarithmic representation,<br>
dependent on aperture angle, of the light intensity of the<br>
Fresnel lens spotlight.<br>
Figure 2 shows the embodiment, illustrated in figure 1, of<br>
the Fresnel lens spotlight in a first flood position, in<br><br>
which the focal point F2 of the reflector 1 remote from the<br>
reflector is arranged approximately in a surface of the<br>
Fresnel lens 3 near the reflector.<br>
The value of the displacement a relative to the spot position<br>
is in this case varied in a defined fashion by a mechanical<br>
guide.<br>
The design corresponds in principle to the design of the<br>
Fresnel lens spotlight illustrated in figure 1. However, it<br>
is clearly to be seen from figure 2 that both the aperture<br>
angle of the emergent light bundle 4 has increased, together<br>
with the dark area 6.<br>
However, since in this position a very high fraction of the<br>
light strikes only a very small area in the middle of the<br>
diffusing screen 7, this area especially can be configured<br>
such that the forward-scattering lobe thereof approximately<br>
compensates for the dark area 6 in the far field or far<br>
region in the desired way. Reference may also be made to<br>
figure 6, which reproduces the lighting conditions with the<br>
line 9, for example for a flood position.<br>
Reference is made below to figure 3, which shows the<br>
embodiment, illustrated in figure 1, of the Fresnel lens<br>
spotlight in a second flood position with an even greater<br>
aperture angle than in figure 2, the focal point F2 of the<br>
reflector 1 remote from the reflector being imaged by the<br>
Fresnel lens 7 in front of the surface of the Fresnel lens 7<br>
remote from the reflector.<br>
In this case, a greater area of	the diffusing screen 7 is<br>
transilluminated than in figure	2, and the entire scattering<br>
behavior thereof can be adapted	to the conditions of this<br>
flood position.<br><br>
As illustrated in figure 3, a turtner expansion of one lamp<br>
is obtained as an alternative or in addition to the flood<br>
position from figure 2 by changing the spacing b of the lamp<br>
2 from the reflector 1. As the lamp 2 is displaced toward the<br>
reflector 1, the light bundle leaving the reflector is yet<br>
more strongly focused, the result being increased exit angles<br>
after the Fresnel lens 3 is exited.<br>
In order for the uniformity of the illumination level to be<br>
maintained, in a particularly preferred embodiment the<br>
variations in spacing are performed by an expediently<br>
selected positive coupling that sets the variation of a and b<br>
to a defined ratio which is, however, not illustrated in the<br>
figures.<br>
The variation in the spacing a and also in the spacing b can<br>
be performed by hand in one embodiment, it being possible for<br>
this purpose to use axial, guidance of the optical components.<br>
A further preferred embodiment is shown in figure 4. In this<br>
embodiment, which essentially corresponds, except for an<br>
additional auxiliary reflector 18, to the embodiments<br>
described above, light from the lamp 2 that would propagate<br>
to the right in figure 4 and no longer reach the reflector 1<br>
is directed by the auxiliary reflector 18 into the reflector<br>
1 by reflection. Consequently, not only is it possible to<br>
make use of the light that is illustrated only by way of<br>
example by the beam path 19 and would not contribute to the<br>
illumination without the auxiliary reflector, but it is also<br>
possible to make better use for the desired light<br>
distribution of that fraction of the light which otherwise<br>
enters the Fresnel lens 3 directly.<br><br>
The shape of the auxiliary reflector 18 is advantageously<br>
selected such that light reflected thereat does not re-enter,<br>
and additionally unnecessarily heat up, the luminous means of<br>
the lamp 2, for example a filament or discharge zone.<br>
Alternatively, the auxiliary reflector 18 can be mounted on<br>
the inside and/or outside of the glass body of the lamp 2.<br>
The glass of the lamp body can be appropriately shaped for<br>
this purpose, in order to achieve the desired directional<br>
action for the reflected light. Figure 5 shows by way of<br>
example a Fresnel lens 3 with a diffusing screen 7, such as<br>
used by the invention. The Fresnel lens 3 has a transparent<br>
basic body 10 and a Fresnel lens ring system 11 with annular<br>
lens portions 11, 12, 13 within which the circular diffusing<br>
screen 7 is arranged.<br>
The diffusing screen 7 is structured in a defined fashion or<br>
has facets 15, 16, 17 with a scattering behavior that can be<br>
exactly defined over large areas and are described by the<br>
title „diffusing screen" in the German patent application<br>
from the same applicant DE 103 43 630.8, which was filed on<br>
September 19 at the German Patent and Trademark Office. The<br>
disclosure content of this application is also incorporated<br>
in full in the disclosure content of this application by<br>
reference.<br>
The invention is not, however, restricted to these previously<br>
described embodiments of diffusing screens.<br>
The Fresnel lens spotlight described above is used with<br>
particular advantage in an illumination set together with an<br>
electric power supply unit that is substantially reduced in<br>
size by comparison to the prior art. In conjunction with a<br>
useful light power equal to that of the prior art, this power<br>
supply unit can be configured to be smaller both electrically<br><br>
and mechanically, since the Fresnel lens spotlight according<br>
to the invention has a substantially higher light yield. A<br>
lower weight is therefore required, and less storage space is<br>
taken up during transportation and storage.<br>
Particularly when use is made of cold light reflectors,<br>
however, this also has the result of reducing the entire<br>
thermal loading of the persons and objects being illuminated.<br>
Furthermore, the Fresnel lens spotlight according to the<br>
invention can also advantageously be used to increase the<br>
light yield in pocket lamps.<br>
List of reference numerals<br><br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	A Fresnel lens spotlight with an adjustable aperture angle of the<br>
emergent light bundle, having a preferably ellipsoidal reflector, a lamp<br>
and at least one Fresnel lens, wherein the Fresnel lens has a diffusing<br>
screen which is of circular design and which is arranged at the center of<br>
the Fresnel lens.<br>
2.	The Fresnel lens spotlight as claimed in claim 1, wherein the Fresnel<br>
lens defines with the diffusing screen a light mixing system that varies<br>
the fraction of the scattered light relative to the fraction of the light<br>
imaged by geometrical optics, and thereby the light mixing ratio, as a<br>
function of the position of the Fresnel lens spotlight.<br>
3.	The Fresnel lens spotlight as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the<br>
Fresnel lens has a real focal point on which it is possible to superimpose<br>
a focal point of the reflector that is remote from the reflector, in<br>
particular at the spot position of the Fresnel lens spotlight.<br>
4.	The Fresnel lens spotlight as claimed in one of the preceding claims,<br>
wherein the Fresnel lens is a preferably planoconvex positive lens<br>
designed as a Fresnel lens.<br><br>

wherein the Fresnel lens comprises a double lens with chromatically<br>
corrected imaging properties.<br>
6.	The Fresnel lens spotlight, ion particular as claimed in one of the<br>
preceding claims, wherein the spacing between the Fresnel lens and<br>
reflector can be varied as a defined geometric function in relation to the<br>
spacing between the lamp and reflector in accordance with the aperture<br>
angle to be adjusted for the light bundle emerging from the spotlight.<br>
7.	The Fresnel lens spotlight as claimed in claim 6, wherein the spacing<br>
(b) can be adjusted by virtue of the fact that the lamp is arranged<br>
displacably with reference to the vertex point of the reflector.<br>
8.	The Fresnel lens spotlight as claimed in one of the preceding claims,<br>
wherein the reflector consists of a metallic or transparent, preferably<br>
dielectric material, glass and/or plastic.<br>
9.	The Fresnel lens spotlight as claimed in one of the preceding claims, in<br>
which at least one of the two principal surfaces of the reflector is<br>
provided with a system of optically thin layers.<br><br>

wherein at least one of the two principal surfaces of the reflector is<br>
coated with metal, preferably aluminium.<br>
11.	The Fresnel lens spotlight as claimed in one of the preceding claims,<br>
in which the light-reflecting surface of the reflector, which preferably has<br>
partial surfaces or facets, is structured in a light-scattering fashion, and<br>
no, one or two surfaces of the Fresnel lens are, in addition to the<br>
diffusing screen, patterned to scatter light.<br>
12.	The Fresnel lens spotlight as claimed in one of the preceding claims,<br>
wherein the reflector, the Fresnel lens and/or the diffusing screen are<br>
coated on at least one side.<br>
13.	The Fresnel lens spotlight as claimed in claim 12, wherein the<br>
coating of the Fresnel lens comprises a dielectric interference layer<br>
system that varies the spectrum of the light passing through.<br>
14.	The Fresnel lens spotlight as claimed in one of the preceding claims,<br>
wherein the lamp is an incandescent lamp, in particular a halogen lamp,<br>
a light-emitting diode, a light-emitting diode array or a gas discharge<br>
lamp.<br><br>
15.	The Fresnel lens spotlight as claimed in one of the preceding claims,<br>
wherein the auxiliary reflector is arranged between the Fresnel lens and<br>
the reflector.<br>
16.	The Fresnel lens spotlight as claimed in one of the preceding claims,<br>
wherein the surface of the Fresnel lens is toughened, preferably<br>
thermally toughened.<br>
17.	An illumination set comprising a Fresnel lens spotlight as claimed in<br>
one of the preceding claims 1 to 16 and an assigned electrical power<br>
supply unit or ballast.<br>
18.	A Fresnel lens spotlight as claimed in claims 1 to 16 and an<br>
illumination set as claimed in claimed in claim 17 for medicine,<br>
architecture, film, stage, studio and photography.<br>
19.	A pocket lamp comprising a Fresnel lens spotlight as claimed in one<br>
of the preceding claims.<br><br>
In order, in the case of a Fresnel lens spotlight with an<br>
adjustable aperture angle of the emergent light bundle and<br>
having a preferably ellipsoidal reflector, a lamp and at<br>
least one Fresnel lens, to provide a homogeneously<br>
illuminated light field in conjunction with a high<br>
efficiency, in particular including in the flood position, it<br>
is provided that the Fresnel lens has a diffusing screen.</td>
