DESCRIPTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This application relates to a disposable electrochemical glucose sensor of the<br>
type used by diabetics to monitor blood glucose levels.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Disposable strip electrochemical glucose sensors have been commercially<br>
available for over 10 years, and are described in various patents including US Patents<br>
Nos. 4,711,245, 5,708,247 and 5,802,551. These sensors utilize redox mediators to<br>
facilitate charge exchange between enzyme and electrode. These devices offer<br>
significant advantages over the older optical technology, such as the fact that the<br>
blood does not go into the meter and the meters themselves tend to be much lighter<br>
and less cumbersome; but they also suffer some disadvantages. The electrochemical<br>
tests results are typically affected by other electroactive species present in the sample<br>
and also by the oxygen content and haematocrit of the sample.<br>
The reason for the interference by electro-active species is very straight-<br>
forward. Species which are readily oxidizable result in an increased current which<br>
leads to an elevated reading. The increased current may be due to direct oxidation at<br>
the electrode surface or arise via redox catalysis. Some manufacturers have tried to<br>
address this problem by using an auxiliary electrode to make a background<br>
subtraction. While this approach is useful, it adds an extra manufacturing step; adding<br>
cost and an extra measurement with its associated errors, thereby degrading precision.<br>
Background subtraction can also lead to an overcorrection since the efficiencies of<br>
interferant redox catalysis can be different on the two electrodes depending on the<br>
analyte concentration.<br>
The oxygen and haematocrit effects are linked. Oxygen is the natural cofactor <br>
for glucose oxidase, so in the presence of oxygen there will be strong competition<br>
between oxygen and redox mediator resulting in a depressed signal. Similarly, since<br>
hemoglobin is a highly efficient oxygen delivery medium, high sample haematocrits<br>
will also result in depressed signals. Exclusion membranes which keep blood cells<br>
away from the electrode surface have been proposed to reduce the haematocrit effect<br>
(US Pat. No. 5,658,444). This approach adds additional manufacturing steps, and is<br>
in any event only effective for a part of the oxygen-based effect.<br>
Thus, there remains a need for a disposable electrochemical devices<br>
which provide readings for blood analyte levels, particularly glucose, that are at most<br>
minimally impacted by the presence of interferants.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
In accordance with the invention, a disposable electrochemical sensor for the<br>
detection of an analyte such as glucose in a liquid sample is provided. The sensor<br>
comprises a working electrode and a reference electrode disposed within a sample-<br>
receiving cavity, a reagent layer disposed within the sample-receiving cavity and over<br>
the working electrode, said reagent layer comprising at least an enzyme for producing<br>
an electrochemical signal in the presence of the analyte, wherein the sample-receiving<br>
cavity has a volume of less than 1.5 µl, and wherein the sensor provides a<br>
measurement that correlates sufficiently well (for example R2&gt;0.95) with the amount<br>
of analyte in a period of 10 seconds or less to allow use the measurement in the<br>
precise and accurate detection and quantitation of the analyte.<br>
The sensor is used in combination with a meter for detection of the analyte in a<br>
liquid sample. A suitable meter comprises a timing circuit for controlling the<br>
measurement of current indicative of analyte in the sample following detection of<br>
sample application to a test strip inserted in the meter, wherein the timing circuit<br>
causes the measurement of current to occur at a time 15 seconds or less after the<br>
detection of sample application.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The key to improving electrochemical strip performance lies in designing the<br>
strip such that the mediated reaction is favoured over the interfering reactions. In the<br>
case of glucose detection, the analyte specific reaction is a mediated reaction<br>
involving enzymatic generation of reduced mediator followed by oxidation of the<br>
mediator at the electrode surface. We therefore concluded that the test should be<br>
constructed such that these reactions take place in close proximity with the electrode<br>
surface in order to provide the maximum collection efficiency.<br>
It is worth considering the diffusion processes taking place during a test.<br>
Consider the application of a sample to the test strip as shown in Fig. 1. The test strip,<br>
in it's dry state, includes an electrode coated with a reagent layer containing enzyme,<br>
E, and mediator, M. The test sample contains glucose, G, electrochemical interferants,<br>
I, and oxygen, O2, which may be bound to hemoglobin, Hb. On application of the<br>
sample there is a net diffusional flux of E and M away from the electrode towards the<br>
test sample and a net diffusional flux of G and I towards the electrode. Hence at very<br>
short times after sample application most of the enzyme is still close to the electrode<br>
and reaction with glucose has a high probability of resulting in generation of a<br>
reduced mediator molecule close enough to the electrode to be captured. At longer<br>
times, much of the enzyme has diffused "deeper" into the sample and can react with<br>
glucose here. This has two effects. Firstly, there is a high probability of the reduced<br>
enzyme being oxidized by O2 rather than M, since the concentration of M will<br>
diminish further from the electrode and the concentration of O2 will increase further<br>
from the electrode (because of this same reaction). Even if the reduced enzyme does<br>
react with M, the probability of the reduced M diffusing back to the electrode to be<br>
reoxidized with the concomitant production of a detectable signal is low. Secondly,<br>
the sequence of reactions just described has the effect of depleting the inwardly<br>
diffusing G, so that the amount of G that actually arrives in the vicinity of the<br>
electrode where it can be detected with some efficiency is reduced. Clearly both of<br>
these factors contribute to a reduced signal in the presence of oxygen in the sample.<br>
Similarly, common interferants are easily oxidized materials such as ascorbate,<br>
acetaminophen and uric acid which upon reaching the electrode surface are oxidized<br>
along with reduced mediator that may be present. Since this effect can only occur<br>
when I is present near the electrode surface, it will be at its minimum at short times<br>
before diffusion of I to the electrode has occurred.<br>
As is apparent from this mechanistic explanation, one solution to both of the<br>
problems of interferants and hematocrit/oxygen levels is to make the measurement at<br>
very short times. An alternative solution is to restrict the sample volume so that the<br>
surface area of the electrode is very large compared to the sample volume. A good<br>
configuration is one that ensures that the sample layer over the electrode is very thin<br>
(e.g. 
hydrodynamics settle down more rapidly. With a large sample volume convective<br>
effects in the sample lead to noise in the measurement. By maintaining a low sample<br>
volume in the form of a thin film convective effects are minimized. This means that<br>
with a low sample volume it is possible to make measurements earlier.<br>
In practice, these solutions are related and are both implemented in the<br>
biosensors of the present invention. Thus, the present invention provides disposable<br>
electrochemical sensors and associated meters which are adapted for taking<br>
electrochemical measurements of the amount of an analyte in a sample, for example<br>
for quantification of blood glucose levels, in a shorter time than previously known<br>
systems. The sensors of the invention take advantage of the synergistic relationship<br>
between short measurement times and small sample volumes to achieve superior<br>
performance. Low sample volume allows earlier measurement because of early<br>
settling of hydrodynamic effects, and thus facilitates measurements at short times.<br>
Low sample volume also necessitates short time measurements because the small<br>
signal diminishes at longer times and therefore cannot provide a reliable reading. By<br>
choosing this kind of configuration we ensure that the mediator concentration is kept<br>
high so that the mediator competes more effectively with oxygen for the reduced<br>
enzyme.<br>
Achieving a device which utilizes a small sample volume is highly desirable<br>
from the patient point of view. The challenge is creating a device which utilizes a<br>
small sample volume to produce reliable measurements of the analyte concentration.<br>
The first part of this process is the definition of a small volume sample-receiving<br>
cavity. The volume of this cavity is defined by the area of the electrodes and the<br>
thickness of the gap between the electrodes. There is a lower limit to the area of<br>
electrodes which can be achieved by any given printing process, determined by edge<br>
definition and print tolerances. One way to improve this precision when using known<br>
electrode printing inks is with the printing methodology described in commonly<br>
assigned International Patent Publication No. WO00/42422 which is incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
Once the "area" of the electrodes has been minimized, the sample volume is<br>
further defined by the gap between the electrode surfaces. The primary goal is a thin,<br>
but consistent gap. It should be remembered, however, that if a low sample volume is<br>
achieved by using a very thin gap (i.e. 
infinite diffusion are not met. Because of this, the diffusion layer can extend across<br>
the entire gap, and significantly deplete the sample. Under these circumstances, the<br>
precision of the devices becomes influenced by the additional factor of the precision<br>
of the assembly process that determines the gap size. There is a relationship between<br>
the measurement time and the size at which precision in the gap size becomes<br>
important, which can be understood from consideration of the formula<br>
where L is the diffusion length, D is the diffusion coefficient and t is time. When the<br>
test time is reduced from 15 seconds to 5 seconds, the diffusion length is reduced by a<br>
factor of 3. What this means in practical terms is that by shortening the measurement<br>
time, one can reduce the size of the gap further, without running into the limiting<br>
condition where precision in the gap becomes a substantial factor in the precision of<br>
the device. Thus, for example, assuming a diffusion coefficient of 10-5 cm2sec-1 a 5<br>
second test would require a gap greater than 70 µm, compared to 125 urn which<br>
would be required for a 15 second test. Considering these factors, a suitable<br>
configuration for a sensor in accordance with the invention has a sample receiving<br>
cavity with a volume of less than 1.5 ul. Combined with considerations about the gap<br>
size, this means that the working electrode is desirably sized such that the ratio of the<br>
surface area of the working electrode to the gap size is about 0.5 to 100mm. In a<br>
specific preferred configuration, the area of each electrode is 0.8 mm2 and the gap is<br>
100-150 um, to define a sample-receiving compartment with a volume of 0.5 to 0.8<br>
µl.<br>
Fig. 2 shows an electrochemical sensor 10 in accordance with a first<br>
embodiment of the invention. Electrodes 11 and 12 are formed on a base substrate 13.<br>
The base substrate 13 in combination with spacers 14, 15 and top cover 16 define a<br>
cavity 17 in which the electrochemical reactions occur. In an exemplary embodiment,<br>
the electrodes have a surface area of 5 mm2 and the volume of the cavity is suitably<br>
less than 1.5 ul, preferably less than 1 ul and most preferably less than 0.5 ul.<br>
A device of the type shown in Fig. 2 can be manufactured as follows.<br>
Electrodes 11 and 12 are deposited onto substrate 13. The specific manner of<br>
depositing will be determined by the nature of electrodes, although screen printing is a<br>
preferred technique for many materials. The area of the electrode which will be<br>
exposed to sample in the chamber is defined by depositing an insulating mask over<br>
the electrodes. (See commonly assigned International Patent Publication No.<br>
WO00/42422). Next, the reagent layer is deposited. This layer may cover both<br>
electrodes, or it may be confined to the area over the working electrode. Spacers 14<br>
and 15 are then formed in a pattern around the electrodes. In a preferred embodiment,<br>
these spacers are formed by printing a layer of adhesive having a dry height of about<br>
150 µm. This spacer defines the capillary gap without the need to utilize a preformed<br>
solid material and thus substantially facilitates the production of the devices of the<br>
invention. The final step is the application of a cover 16 to complete the chamber 17.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, the cover 16 is affixed to the device via the adhesive<br>
spacers 14,15.<br>
Figs. 9 A-C illustrate a specific embodiment of a manufacturing technique for<br>
the production of a sensor in accordance with the invention. The figure shows a<br>
single sensor, but it will be appreciated that more than one sensor will generally be<br>
prepared. Fig. 9 A shows the structure of the device before lamination of the cover.<br>
The sensor at this stage has two electrodes 11,12 deposited on a substrate (not shown<br>
for clarity). Electrical connections to these electrodes are not shown. A reagent pad<br>
100, for example containing an appropriate enzyme for the analyte, is deposited over<br>
both electrodes. Adhesive pads 101, 102 and 103 are deposited on three sides of the<br>
reagent pad. Two pieces 104,105 of a hydrophilic film (such as 3M 9962, a 100<br>
micron thick surfactant-treated optically clear polyester film) are then placed in two<br>
locations, one spanning the adhesive pads 101 and 102 and covering the electrodes<br>
and reagent pad, and one covering a portion of the adhesive pad 103 to provide a<br>
support of consistent height for receiving the cover 116. (Fig. 9B) The positions of<br>
these pieces of hydrophobic film creates a capillary chamber over the two electrodes.<br>
The hydrophilic coating of the film encourages the movement, by capillary action, of<br>
the test liquid into the sample chamber created. The gap 106, formed in the area<br>
where there is no spacer or film allows air to escape from the back of the chamber as<br>
the test liquid moves into the sample chamber created. A pressure sensitive tape is<br>
applied as a top cover 116 over the hydrophilic films. The top cover 116 is suitably<br>
formed of a polyester film and can be ocated with either a heat-activated adhesive or a<br>
pressure sensitive adhesive. The final step is cutting the device to create the<br>
appropriate opening sample chamber, for example by cutting along the dashed line C-<br>
C in Fig. 9B. Fig. 9C shows an end view of the device after being cut along this line<br>
C-C. As shown, the capillary entrance 110 to the sample chamber is defined by the<br>
substrate 13, the adhesive pads 101,102 and the hydrophilic film 104 and the top<br>
cover 116. The films 104 and 105 are supported by the adhesive pads 101 and 102.<br>
Fig. 3 shows an electrochemical sensor 20 in accordance with a second<br>
embodiment of the invention. Electrodes 21 and 22 are formed respectively on a base<br>
substrate 23 and a top cover 26. The base substrate 23 in combination with spacers<br>
24, 25 and top cover 26 define a cavity 27 in which the electrochemical reactions<br>
occur. The sensor is constructed with a low volume and thin gap between the base<br>
substrate 23 and the top cover 26, for example from 50 to 200 um. It should be noted<br>
that the surface area of the electrodes can double for the same size device, because of<br>
the folded, face-to-face configuration.<br>
A device with this structure can be made using web printing technology as<br>
described in commonly assigned US Patent Application 09/537,599, filed March 28,<br>
2000, which is incorporated herein by reference. This technology utilizes an<br>
apparatus of the type shown schematically in Fig. 4. A running web of substrate 31 is "<br>
provided on a feed roll 32 and is transported over a plurality of print stations 33, 34,<br>
and 35, each of which prints a different layer onto the substrate. The number of print<br>
stations can be any number and will depend on the number of layers required for the<br>
particular device being manufactured. Between successive print stations, the web is<br>
preferably transported through a dryer 36, 37, and 38, to dry each layer before<br>
proceeding to the deposition of the next. After, the final dryer 38, the printed web is<br>
collected on a take up roll or introduced directly into a post-processing apparatus 39.<br>
To make a device with the structure shown in Fig. 3 in this apparatus, parallel<br>
conductive tracks 71 and 72; reagent layer(s) 73 and an insulation layer 74 are deposit<br>
on a substrate 70 as shown in Fig. 5. The substrate is then folded along a fold line<br>
disposed between the two conductive tracks to produce a sensor in which two face-to-<br>
face electrodes are separated by a reagent layer. An electrode geometry with the<br>
electrodes disposed on opposing surfaces within the cavity is beneficial because the<br>
voltage drop due to solution resistance is low as a result of the thin layer of solution<br>
separating the electrodes.<br>
In each of the embodiments of the invention described above, the cavity is<br>
defined by insulative materials. Suitable insulative materials for this purpose include<br>
nylon, polyester, polycarbonate and polyvinylchloride. Suitable materials for use as<br>
the substrate include polyester films, for example a 300 micron polyester fim, and<br>
other insulating substrate materials such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and<br>
polycarbonate. A specific polyester-based printable dielectric material from which<br>
the insulating mask ca be formed is ERCON R488-B(HV)-B2 Blue. Within the<br>
cavity, a working and a reference electrode are formed from a conductive material.<br>
Suitable conductive materials include conductive carbon, gold, platinum, aluminum or<br>
doped semiconductor materials such as n-type SnO2. Preferred conductive carbon<br>
materials are ERCON ERC1, ERCON ERC2 and Acheson Carbon Electrodag 423.<br>
Carbon with these specification is available from Ercon, Inc. (Waltham,<br>
Massachusetts, USA), or Acheson Colloids (Princes Rock, Plymouth, England).<br>
Semiconductor electrodes offer an attractive option because they can be<br>
functionalized to permit the surface attachment of enzymes or other components of<br>
the reagent layer. This provides the benefits associated with immobilization, and also<br>
permits direct electron transfer between the reagent and the electrode.<br>
The electrodes may be made from different materials or may be of the same<br>
material. Embodiments in which the electrodes are of the same composition, for<br>
example a carbon-electrode, can offer advantages. Specifically, the use of a single<br>
electrode material allows the working and the reference electrodes to be deposited in a<br>
single step, thus eliminating an electrode print from the production process. The two<br>
electrodes can be printed very close together since the separation between is<br>
determined solely by the artwork on one screen (tolerance about 200 µm) and not on<br>
the alignment which can be achieved between separate print runs (tolerance over 0.5<br>
mm) This allows the reaction area to be more compact and thus leads to a reduction in<br>
the volume of blood required to cover the electrodes.<br>
The working electrode has one or more reagent layers disposed over the<br>
electrode which contain the enzyme and mediator used in the detection of the target<br>
analyte. Thus, for example, in a glucose sensor, the reagent layer(s) would include an<br>
enzyme such as glucose oxidase and a mediator such as ferricyanide, metallocene<br>
compounds, quinones, phenazinium salts, redox indicator DCPIP, and imidazole-<br>
substituted osmium compounds. The reagent layer may be a single layer including<br>
both enzyme and mediator, or may be constituted from a plurality of sub layers, some<br>
containing enzyme or enzyme and mediator and some containing only mediator.<br>
Because the devices of the invention are intended to be used at short time<br>
intervals, an important characteristic of the electrodes is the ability to rapidly hydrate.<br>
Hydration rate is determined by the reagent layer composition. An electrode system<br>
which utilizes a silica-based reagent layer of the type described in US Patent No.<br>
5,708,247, which is incorporated herein by reference, and International Patent<br>
Publication No. WO00/42422 permits rapid wetting and hydration and it therefore<br>
suitable for use in the sensors of the invention. The optimal material for the reagent<br>
layers of the electrodes of the sensors of the invention is one which hydrates rapidly to<br>
form a gel which remains in contact with the electrode surface and retains reagents in<br>
the vicinity of the electrode. If the reagent layer disperses rapidly following<br>
hydration, the reagents (and in particular the enzyme reagent) are rapidly lost from the<br>
vicinity of the electrode surface where they are most beneficial for the development of<br>
a signal reflecting analyte concentration in a sample.<br>
The reagent layer must also comprise a mediator in a form available for<br>
immediate participation in the generation of signal reflecting analyte concentration.<br>
In the case of an analyte such as glucose which is oxidized by the enzyme, this means<br>
that mediator must be rapidly soluble and present in the oxidized form. In a<br>
commercial glucose strip sold by Medisense under the tradenames QID™ and<br>
EXACTECH™, the mediator is actually present in the reduced form and must be<br>
oxidized in situ before is can be can participate in a glucose monitoring reaction. This<br>
limits the response time of the strip, and precludes its use at short test times.<br>
In the case of the reference electrode, the electrode needs to be rapidly<br>
hydrating, and also able to stabilize quickly enough to source the current demanded<br>
by the working electrode instantaneously, i.e, within 200 msec of hydration. A<br>
conventional silver/silver chloride reference electrode does not stabilize quickly<br>
enough. A ferri-ferrocyanide reference on the other hand can be made to equilibrate<br>
very rapidly. In this design, a mediator-containing layer is used that solubilizes or<br>
disperses rapidly. In a specific embodiment of the invention, carbon ink electrodes<br>
are used with a reagent layer containing potassium ferricyanide as the mediator.<br>
Glucose oxidase is used as the enzyme in a hydroxy ethylcellulose-silica base with<br>
polymers added to increase the hydrophilic nature of the formulation. This system<br>
has a very high surface area and wets very rapidly.<br>
In addition to the working electrode and the reference electrode, the device of<br>
the invention may be constructed to include a third electrode. The third electrode may<br>
be a dummy electrode, intended to compensate for background reactions, or a counter<br>
electrode of a conventional three electrode system. The third electrode might also be<br>
an identical working electrode.<br>
In the embodiments of the invention discussed above, all of the layers are<br>
rapidly solubilized or hydrated. While rapid solubilization or at least hydration of the<br>
oxidized mediator is not a problem for interferant consumption, and possibly helps<br>
achieve this requirement, it is not entirely a good characteristic for an enzyme-<br>
containing layer, as described earlier, since this facilitates the enzyme diffusing away<br>
from the area close to the electrode where it is most beneficial. A useful configuration<br>
that combines both aspects, therefore, is shown in Fig 6. In this embodiment of the<br>
invention, the sensor 60 has a cavity 67 formed from a bottom substrate 63, spacers<br>
64, 65 and a top cover 66. Two carbon electrodes 61, 62 are disposed on the bottom<br>
substrate 63 within the cavity 67. Electrode 62 is coated with a relatively thin (e.g. 5<br>
µm) viscous gel layer 68 containing enzyme and mediator. Both electrodes 61,62 are<br>
then covered with a relatively thick (e.g. 25 µm) dispersion layer 69 containing<br>
mediator, but no enzyme.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, two separate layers are configured to<br>
further reduce the effects of interferants. One way to capitalize on the chemical<br>
consumption of interferants is to provide a reagent layer with an excess of oxidized<br>
mediator on the outside. In a particularly attractive configuration an electrode is<br>
coated with a thin reagent layer containing enzyme and mediator and then a thick<br>
layer containing only mediator. Both layers are deposited in a matrix which limits<br>
diffusion but which is rapidly hydrated so that it can carry a current. By confining the<br>
enzyme to a thin layer the enzyme is largely held in close proximity with the electrode<br>
so that the parasitic reactions described above are unimportant. The thick outer<br>
mediator layer provides a barrier to inward diffusing interferants and remains in the<br>
desired position because of the diffusion-limiting matrix. An optional third layer may<br>
be included outside the first and second layers containing mediator in a rapidly<br>
hydrated dispersable matrix. Once again, by ensuring that the sample volume is small,<br>
the total amount of interferant in the sample is kept to a minimum, and the<br>
concentration of oxidized mediator on re-constitution is high so that the mediator<br>
effectively removes interferant. Obviously, at longer times the local concentration of<br>
mediator will fall as it diffuses out into the sample and interference will become more<br>
significant. In our experience a sample volume of less than 1 µl, preferably 0.5 µl, is<br>
ideal.<br>
Sensors made in accordance with the invention allow the taking of test<br>
measurements in much shorter times than achieved using known sensors. By<br>
shortening the test time, haematocrit effects can be reduced. If the sensor comprises<br>
an electrode covered with a reagent layer which has a retarding effect on certain blood<br>
components such as white cells and erythrocytes, then at short times the fluid arriving<br>
at the electrode will contain significantly fewer of these components than at long<br>
times.<br>
Fig.7 shows a plot of correlation coefficient versus test time. At extremely<br>
short test times correlation is poor because the system has not yet stabilized. At very<br>
long test times the correlation also starts to degrade. Given the objective of limiting<br>
interferences by shortening the test time, the test will suitably be conducted in the<br>
regime indicated by the dashed lines, which for the sensors described below will be<br>
less than 10 seconds and preferably around 5 seconds. The disposable sensors of the<br>
invention work in combination with a test meter to provide accurate measurements of<br>
glucose within this time regime. Thus, the sensor is configured to provide signals<br>
which provide accurate and reliable information at short times, and the meter into<br>
which the sensor is inserted is adapted to collect information during this time.<br>
Fig. 8 shows an exterior view of an exemplary hand-held meter in<br>
accordance with the invention. Like conventional meters, the meter of the invention<br>
has a housing 81 with a display 82 for displaying the results, and a slot 83 for<br>
insertion of the disposable sensor. Buttons 85 and/or switches may be included for<br>
operation of the meter, including recall of stored results, calibration checks and the<br>
like. Where the meter of the invention differs from the conventional meter is the in<br>
electronics within the housing. In the conventional meter, the addition of a liquid<br>
sample, such as a drop of blood, to a disposable sensor in the housing starts a<br>
measurement cycle during which reagents are dissolved and a reading taken. The start<br>
of the cycle may also be triggered by the depression of a button by the user, although<br>
this is not preferred. The microprocessor in a meter is typically in a "sleep" mode<br>
and "wakes up" periodically (for example every 1/2 second) to check interrupts. If the<br>
program detects that an interrupt flag is set, indicating that a strip has been inserted in<br>
the meter or the start button has been pressed, the program enters RUN mode. In this<br>
mode, typically a potential is applied to the strip and the microprocessor monitors the<br>
output (duty cycle) of a pulse-width monitor which indicates the level of any current<br>
drawn by the strip. As soon as the sample is applied to the strip, a current flows since<br>
the strip is already subject ed to a polarization potential. Detection of this start current<br>
initiates a timing sequence. Timing is controlled by the microprocessor. There are<br>
two crystals: a 4 MHz clock for operational function (i.e., performing measurements)<br>
and a 32 mHz clock which keeps time in the Off mode. On initiation of the timing<br>
process, the applied potential may either (1) be maintained at a constant level or (2) be<br>
varied following a predetermined profile. In either case, the current is measured after<br>
a predetermined time to assess the amount of analyte in the sample. By way of<br>
example, the data shown in Fig. 7 was collected in a system in which the sample<br>
application was detected at t=0, the applied potential was removed for 2 sec, during<br>
which time the strip is an open circuit, and then the same potential reapplied. The<br>
current was measured at numerous time points and the correlation of current with<br>
analyte concentration determined at each time point.<br>
In commercially available meters known in the art, the measurement cycle is<br>
established to make the current measurement at 20 to 60 seconds after the detection of<br>
sample. In the meters of the invention, which are particularly adapted for use with<br>
rapid-response strips of the invention, the measurement cycle is established to make<br>
current measurements at a time 15 seconds or less after the detection of sample, and<br>
preferably at a time from 5 to 10 seconds after the detection of sample.<br>
The invention will now be further described with reference to the following<br>
non-limiting examples.<br>
Example 1<br>
Rapid response glucose sensors in accordance with the invention were<br>
prepared using the procedures outlined in Figs 9A-C and the following materials:<br>
substrate: polyester film<br>
carbon ink formulation: Ercon conductive carbon<br>
reagent layer composition: as described below<br>
adhesive: water-based acrylic copolymer adhesive (Apollo Adhesives)<br>
hydrophilic film: 3M 100 micron hydrophilic film 9962<br>
top cover: pressure sensitive adhesive coated polyester strip (Tape Specialities)<br>
The reagent layer was formulated as follows. 100 ml of 100 mM aqueous<br>
trisodium citrate was adjusted to pH 5 by the addition of 1 M citric acid. To this 5 g<br>
of hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC), 1 gpolyvinyl alcohol, 1 g PVP-VA S-630 poly(vinyl<br>
pyrrolidone vinyl acetate), and 0.5 ml of DC 1500 Dow Corning anti-foram were<br>
added and mixed by homogenization. The mixture was allowed to stand overnight to<br>
allow air bubbles to disperse and then used as a stock solution for the formulation of<br>
the coating composition. 7.5 g of Cab-o-Sil TS610 were gradually added by hand to<br>
the HEC solution until about 4/5 of the total amount was added. The remainder was<br>
added with mixing by homogenization. The mixture was then rolled for 12 hours. 11<br>
g of potassium ferricyanide was then added and mixed by homogenization until<br>
completely dissolved. Finally, 2.8 g of glucose oxidase enzyme prepartion (250<br>
Units/mg) was added and then thoroughly mixed into the solution. The resulting<br>
formulation was ready for printing, or could be stored with refrigeration.<br>
The sensors were used to test standard glucose solutions and the current<br>
measured at different times following addition of the glucose to the sensor. The<br>
correlation coefficient between the actual glucose concentration and the measured<br>
glucose concentration was determined for each time interval. Fig. 7 shows a plot of<br>
the results. As shown, the correlation coefficient has achieved a maximum and high<br>
value by 5 seconds after the addition of glucose to the sensor.<br>
Example 2<br>
Rapid response glucose sensors in accordance with the invention were<br>
prepared as in Example 1. These sensors were utilized to determine the amount of<br>
current at five seconds after exposure to different concentrations of glucose. For<br>
comparison, a Medisense QED glucose sensor was tested under the same conditions.<br>
Fig. 10 shows the results of this experiment graphically. As shown, the linearity of<br>
the response of the rapid response sensor in accordance with the invention is very<br>
good (R2=0.999). The linearity of the OID sensor at five seconds was not as good<br>
(R2=0.863).<br>
