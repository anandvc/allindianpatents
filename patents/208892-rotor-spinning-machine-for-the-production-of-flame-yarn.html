Rotor Spinning Machine for the Production of Flame Yarn Technology Field<br>
The invention relates to the rotor spinning machine for the production of flame yarn, the machine contains a number of workstations arranged at least in a single row, which contains one feeder device for the sliver and a delivery roller of the spun yarn, wherein the feeder device of the sliver contains a feeding roller fixed on the feeder shaft, the drive of which is coupled with the feed converter, and the yarn delivery device contains a delivery roller fixed on the delivery shaft, the drive of which is coupled with the delivery converter, wherein the feed converter and the delivery converter are located in the drive cabinet and are connected with the control device of the machine.<br>
Present State of Technology<br>
The production of flame yarn on the rotor spinning machines with the help of additional devices is known, which considerably increase the price and the complexity of the machine.<br>
The purpose of the invention is the formation of the new arrangement of the rotor machine, which would enable the user to produce the normal yarn with the constant thickness as well as the flame yarn, i.e. the yarn on which the points with larger or smaller thicknesses are formed intentionally as compared with the basic thickness of the yarn.<br>
Presentation of the Matter of Invention:<br>
The purpose of invention is achieved with the rotor spinning machine for the production of flame yarn, the matter of invention is that the input of the feed converter of sliver is coupled with the output of the control unit of coloring, whose input is coupled with the information source for the current doffing speed of the yarn, wherein the control unit of coloring contains the memory for storing the information about at least one method of coloring and the means for controlling the<br><br><br>
coloring at least based on the information about the current doffing speed of the yarn and the information about the method of coloring.<br>
The rotor spinning machine according to the invention allows to produce the flame yarn as well as normal yarn, thus for the user this equipment represents a universal equipment, which allows for a minimum increase in the procurement costs yarn with special effect which have a good demand these days, and allows at the same time rotor yarns, which can be brought to the market by user at any time. Here the equipment allows production of the flame yarn based on minimum input initial information of the control unit of coloring.<br>
The first design variant of control device for coloring is described and represents the most simple design of the control unit of coloring, when the control device for coloring contain the device for formation of control signal of coloring, which contains the information about the thickness of the yarn in conjunction with time, which is built up in the control device of coloring based on the information about the current doffing speed of the yarn and information about the coloring method.<br>
This design requires between the control unit of coloring and the feed converter of the sliver the device for generation of information about the sliver feed speed based on the information about the basic feeding speed of the sliver and the control signal of the coloring containing the information about the necessary thickness of the yarn in conjunction with time.<br>
According to the different kind of alternative design the feed converter of the sliver contains the device for generation of information about the feed speed of the sliver based on information about the basic feed speed of the sliver and the information about the thickness of the yarn in conjunction with the time.<br>
Both these designs have the devices for the generation of information of the feed speed of the sliver besides the control unit of coloring, which can be beneficial in<br><br><br>
certain cases of application, for example while customizing the older rotor spinning machines for the production of flame yarn.<br>
For newly manufactured rotor machines for the production of the flame yarn the machine arrangement shows to be beneficial. In this design, control signal of coloring, which is formed by the devices for the control of coloring and the information about the basic feed speed of the sliver are feed in the devices for the generation of feed speed of the sliver.<br>
The higher degree of integration of control unit of coloring is achieved, at which the means for controlling the coloring contains the means for generation of feed speed of the sliver based on the information about the coloring method, information about the basic feed speed and the information about the current doffing speed.<br>
In the arrangement of the rotor spinning machine the control unit of coloring is inserted between the feed converter of sliver and the doffing converter of yarn and at the input of the control unit the output of the feed converter of sliver is connected for feeding information about the basic feed speed of sliver and the output of doffing converter of yarn is connected for feeding information about the current doffing speed of yarn and the output of the control unit is coupled with the input of feed converter of sliver. The advantage of this arrangement is in its simple overview and the full utilization of means of the rotor spinning machine for producing the flame yarn and, if necessary, for producing the standard yarn. For the purpose of producing the flame yarn no additional devices require to be fitted to the rotor spinning machine.<br>
It is advantageous, if the control unit of coloring is coupled in both the directions with the control device of the machine. This design is important especially in such cases, when a larger volume of coloring programs is stored in the memory of the control unit, when this coupling serves the purpose of selection of respective coloring program. The next advantage of this arrangement is in the production<br><br><br>
facility for producing flame yarn in various ways at each work station or in the group of work stations.<br>
For the purpose of ensuring optimum stability of thickness of produced yarn the feed converter of sliver and the doffing converter of yarn are coupled mutually with back coupling on both sides.<br>
It is advantageous, if the rotor spinning machine is a rotor spinning machine for the production of component yarn. So that one can achieve the combination of component yarn with the flame yarn and on both sides the possibilities of interspersing the yarn produced on the rotor spinning machine according to the invention are increased.<br>
Overview of the illustrations on the drawing<br>
The design example of the arrangement of rotor spinning machine is shown according to the invention in the schematic manner in the enclosed drawing, where Fig. 1 to 6 show different variants of the arrangement of control unit of coloring inserted in the rotor spinning machine, Fig. 7a shows the speed pattern of sliver feed without coloring in conjunction with time and Fig. 7b shows the speed pattern of sliver feed during the course of coloring in conjunction with time.<br>
Design examples of the invention<br>
The rotor spinning machine contains a number of workstations, which are arranged<br>
next to each other in one row or in two rows. Each workstation contains device and<br>
fitting for the production of yarn and its winding, of which only those will be<br>
described, which have relevance for the development and/ or function of the<br>
invention.<br>
The two-sided rotor spinning machine contains two rows of workstations arranged near each other, each of which contains the feeding device of sliver, which contains the feed roller, which is fitted on the respective side of the feeding shaft running<br><br><br>
through the machine. The feeding shafts on both sides of the machine are coupled with the drive, which is coupled with the feed converter 1 of the sliver, which serves for changing the feed speed of the sliver in the spinning unit. Each workstation contains also the doffing device of yarn, which is spun on it. The doffing device of yarn contains doffing roller and pressure roller. The doffing roller is permanently fitted on one of the doffing shafts, each of which runs through one side of the machine and both are coupled with the common drive, which is coupled with the doffing converter 2 of the yarn, which serves for changing the doffing speed of the yarn. The doffing converter 2 of the yarn and the feed converter 1 of the sliver are fitted in the known manner in the drive cabinet and are coupled with control device<br>
3	of the machine for the purpose of mutual communication, especially for the<br>
purpose of setting the parameters of both the converters 1 and 2.<br>
In the design example according to Fig. 1 the control unit 4 of coloring is inserted between the control device 3 of the machine and both the converters 1,2, control unit<br>
4	is coupled with the control device 3 of the machine in both the directions for the<br>
purpose of transmission of information in both the directions. As can be seen from<br>
the Fig.l the output 21 of doffing converter 2 of the yarn is coupled with the input 41<br>
of the control unit of coloring and the output 42 of the control unit 4 of coloring is<br>
coupled with the input 11 of the feed converter 1 of the sliver. The control unit 4 of<br>
coloring contains the memory 43 and the device 44 for controlling the coloring based<br>
on the information IFOA about the current doffing speed of the yarn and the<br>
information IF about the method of coloring. The coupling of the output of doffing<br>
converter 2 of the yarn with the input 41 of the control unit 4 of coloring serves the<br>
purpose of feeding of information IVoa about current doffing speed of the yarn in the<br>
control unit 4 of coloring. The information about the current doffing speed of the<br>
yarn can be gained in any known method from one of the equipment for tracking the<br>
doffing speed of the yarn.<br>
In the memory 43 the information about at least one method of coloring is saved, i.e. information about the necessary thickness and length of the flame, about the length<br><br><br>
of the following gap, i.e. the basic thickness of the yarn, information about the necessary thickness and length of the next flame, the length of the next gap etc. The thickness and the length of flames can be variable or all flames and gaps between these can be identical.<br>
Flame is that part of the yarn length, which has a different thickness than the basic thickness, which is set by the control device 3 of the machine with the help of parameter settings of feed converter 1 of the sliver and the doffing converter 2 of the yarn, wherein the thickness of flame is usually greater than the basic thickness of the yarn, however, it can be smaller.<br>
In case, in the memory of the control unit 4 of coloring several methods/ programs of coloring are stored, then one of the programs is selected from the control device 3 of the machine with the help of communication common bar 31 (in two directions) and then the control unit 4 of coloring proceeds accordingly while spinning. In case control unit 4 of coloring contains the information merely about the method of coloring, then it works automatically without the intervention of the control device of the machine and, if change of coloring method is necessary, then the new coloring method is recorded in the memory of the control unit 4 of coloring either via the control device 4 of the machine or directly, whereby in the last design example the communication common bar 31 between the control device 3 of the machine and the control unit 4 of the coloring can be omitted.<br>
In the design example as per Fig. 2 the means 44 for controlling of coloring contains means for formation of control signal RSF of the coloring, which contains the information about the thickness of yarn in relation to time. In the means 44 for controlling the coloring the information IVoa about current doffing speed of the yarn is fed from the doffing converter 2 of the yarn and information IF about the method of coloring is fed from the memory 43 to the control unit 4 of coloring.<br><br><br>
This design requires to place before the performing means of feed converter 1 of sliver the means 50 for generating the information IVp about the feed speed of the sliver based on the information IVpz about the basic feed speed of the sliver and the control signal RSF of the coloring.<br>
In the design example as per Fig. 3, therefore, between the control unit 4 of coloring and the feed converter 1 of the sliver the means 50 is inserted for generating the information IVp about the feed speed of the sliver, whose first input 51 is coupled with the output 42 of the control unit 4 of coloring for feeding the control signal RSF of coloring and whose second input 52 is coupled with the output of the feed converter 1 of the sliver for feeding of information IVpz about the basic feed speed of the sliver. The output 53 of the means 50 is coupled with the input 11 of the feed converter 1 of the sliver, wherein this coupling serves the purpose of transmitting the information IVp about the feed speed of the sliver from the means 50 in the feed converter 1 of the sliver.<br>
In the design example as per Fig. 4 the means 50 forms the part of the feed converter 1 of the sliver, in which the control signal RSF of coloring is fed, wherein the information IVpz about the basic feed speed of the sliver forms the part of the total information of feed converter 1 of the sliver as well as the information iVp about the feed speed of the sliver, which is generated by means 50.<br>
The designs mentioned above represent simpler forms of the invention, which are applicable especially for applications of the invention on the older machines or for lower customer requirements with respect to lower grade control electronics of the machine.<br>
For newly designed machines with high requirements at the control level the designs according to Fig. 5 and 6 are advantageous, in which the control unit 4 of coloring is equipped with two inputs, of which the first input 411 is coupled with the output 21 of the doffing converter 2 of the yarn for feeding the information IVoa about current<br><br><br>
doffing speed of the yarn and the second input 412 is coupled with the output 11 of the feed converter 1 of the sliver for feeding of information IVpz about the basic feed speed, i.e. the feed speed of the sliver without coloring.<br>
According to Fig. 5 the control unit 4 of coloring contains - among others - the memory 43, which is coupled with the control device 3 of the machine with the aim of selecting the coloring method. The memory 43 is further coupled with the means 44 for controlling the coloring, whose second input is coupled with the information feed IVoa about the current doffing speed, which is developed in the represented design through the coupling with the output 21 of the feed converter 2 of the sliver. The output 441 of the means 44 for controlling of coloring is coupled with the first input 51 of the generator 50 of information IVp about the feed speed of the sliver based on the information IVpz about the basic feed speed of the sliver and control signal RSF of coloring. The control signal RSF of coloring is developed in the means 44 for controlling the coloring, from where it is fed in the generator 50 of information IVp about the feed speed of the sliver. The second input 52 of the generator 50 is coupled with the output 12 of the feed converter 1 of the sliver and through this coupling the information IVpz about basic feed speed of the sliver is fed in the generator, which serves along with the control signal RSF of coloring the purpose of developing information IVp about the feed speed of the sliver, which is fed to the output 42 of the control unit 4 of coloring and from here in the feed converter 1 of the sliver.<br>
In the design according to Fig.6 the generator 50 of information IVp about feed speed of sliver is integrated in the means 44 for controlling of coloring, as a result of which, these are provided with the nearest input, which is coupled with the output 12 of the feed converter 1 of the sliver for feeding of information IVpz about the basic feed speed of the sliver in the means 44 for controlling the coloring, in which the information IVp about the feed speed of the sliver is developed, which is fed to the output 42 of the control unit 4 of coloring and from here in the feed converter 1 of sliver via its input 11.<br><br><br>
In the control unit 4 of coloriiig from the feed converter 1 of sliver the information IVpz about the basic feed speed of the sliver is fed and at the same time from the doffing converter 2 of the yarn the formation IVoa about the current doffing speed of the yarn is fed. The information IVpz about the basic feed speed of the sliver - while doffing speed remaining practically constant - represents the information about the yarn thickness. The control unit 4 of coloring selects from its memory 43 one after the other the following parameters of coloring and sorts and changes according to these the information IVF about fifie feed speed of the stiver, wherein with the demand for increased coloring the feed speed of sliver is increased, and this occurs through the feed of signal from the output of the control unit 4 of coloring to the input of the feed converter 1 for the duration, for which, at the current doffing speed, such length of yarn is produced, which corresponds the required length of the flame. The increase in doffing speed corresponds the required thickness of the flame. After producing the required thickness of the flame the feed speed returns to its original size or in case of change of doffing speed it returns to such a level, which corresponds the basic thickness of the yarn $t the changed doffing speed, with which the basic thickness of the yarn is produced for such a duration, which is equal to the required length of the gap between the flames, thereafter, the next flame is produced. In case of need for weakened flame the feed speed of the sliver reduces and it returns to the basic value after the end of coloring.<br>
For the purpose of ensuring optimum stability of the thickness of the produced yarn the feed converter 1 and the doffing converter 2 are coupled with each other with dual side back coupling, like it is shown in Fig. 1. Especially for the lower requirements with respect to quality of the produced yarn, however, this linkage can be done away with.<br>
In Fig. 7 the pattern of changes of feed speed of sliver during the course of coloring is represented, wherein the basic feed speed the sliver is shown as shaded line.<br><br>
Further, it is advantageous, if the rotor spinning machine is the rotor spinning machine for the production of the component yarn. Thereby, one reaches the combination of component yarn with the flame yarn and the possibility of implementation of yarn produced according to the invention on the rotor spinning machine is increased considerably.<br><br><br>
