				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates in general to surgical instruments that are suitable<br>
for endoscopically inserting an end effector (e.g., endocutter, grasper, cutter,<br>
staplers, clip applier, access device, drug/gene therapy delivery device, and a<br>
energy device using ultrasound, RF, laser, etc.) to a surgical site, and more<br>
particularly to such surgical instruments with an articulating shaft.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Endoscopic surgical instruments are often preferred over traditional open surgical<br>
devices since a smaller incision tends to reduce the post-operative recovery time<br>
and complications. Consequently, significant development has gone into a range<br>
of endoscopic surgical instruments that are suitable for precise placement of a<br>
distal end effector at a desired surgical site through a cannula of a trocar. These<br>
distal end effectors engage the tissue engage tissue in a number of ways to<br>
achieve a diagnostic or therapeutic effect (e.g., endocutter, grasper, cutter,<br>
staplers, clip applier, access device, drug/gene therapy delivery device, and<br>
energy device using ultrasound, RF, laser, etc.).<br>
Positioning the end effector is constrained by the trocar. Generally these<br>
endoscopic surgical instruments include a long shaft between the end effector<br>
and a handle portion manipulated by the clinician. This long shaft enables<br>
insertion to a desired depth and rotation about the longitudinal axis of the shaft,<br>
thereby positioning the end effector to a degree. With judicious placement of the<br>
trocar and use of graspers, for instance, through another trocar, often this<br>
amount of positioning is sufficient. Surgical stapling and severing instruments,<br>
such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,465,895, are an example of an endoscopic<br>
surgical instrument that successfully positions an end effector by insertion and<br>
rotation.<br>
More recently, U.S. Pat. Ser. No. 10/443,617, "SURGICAL STAPLING<br>
INSTRUMENT INCORPORATING AN E-BEAM FIRING MECHANISM" to Shelton et<br>
al., filed on 20 May 2003, describes an improved "E-beam" firing bar for severing<br>
tissue and actuating staples. Some of the additional advantages include<br>
affirmatively spacing the jaws of the end effector, even if slightly too much or<br>
too little tissue is clamped for optimal staple formation. Moreover, the E-beam<br>
firing bar engages the end effector and staple cartridge in a way that enables<br>
several beneficial lockouts to be incorporated.<br>
Depending upon the nature of the operation, it may be desirable to further<br>
adjust the positioning of the end effector of an endoscopic surgical instrument.<br>
In particular, it is often desirable to orient the end effector at an axis transverse<br>
to the longitudinal axis of the shaft of the instrument. The transverse movement<br>
of the end effector relative to the instrument shaft is conventionally referred to<br>
as "articulation". This articulated positioning permits the clinician to more easily<br>
engage tissue is some instances, such as behind an organ. In addition,<br>
articulated positioning advantageously allows an endoscope to be positioned<br>
behind the end effector without being blocked by the instrument shaft.<br>
Approaches to articulating a surgical stapling and severing instrument tend to be<br>
complicated by integrating control of the articulation along with the control of<br>
closing the end effector to clamp tissue and fire the end effector (i.e., stapling<br>
and severing) within the small diameter constraints of an endoscopic instrument.<br>
Generally, the three control motions are all transferred through the shaft as<br>
longitudinal translations. For instance, U.S. Pat. No. 5,673,840 discloses an<br>
accordion-like articulation mechanism ("flex-neck") that is articulated by<br>
selectively drawing back one of two connecting rods through the implement<br>
shaft, each rod offset respectively on opposite sides of the shaft centerline. The<br>
connecting rods ratchet through a series of discrete positions.<br>
Another example of longitudinal control of an articulation mechanism is U.S. Pat.<br>
No. 5,865,361 that includes an articulation link offset from a camming pivot such<br>
that pushing or pulling longitudinal translation of the articulation link effects<br>
articulation to a respective side. Similarly, U.S. Pat. No. 5,797,537 discloses a<br>
similar rod passing through the shaft to effect articulation.<br>
While these longitudinally controlled articulation mechanisms have provided<br>
certain advantages to surgical instruments such as for endoscopic stapling and<br>
severing, it is believed that an alternative articulation motion would provide<br>
additional design flexibility.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,405,344 teaches an endoscopic surgical instrument that, in the<br>
embodiment (shown in FIGS. 7 13), uses rotary motion about the longitudinal<br>
axis to articulate the end effector of the instrument in a conical motion. As<br>
taught, the articulating end effector uses a ball (convex member 174) attached<br>
to the end effector and a socket in a distal end of the hollow support tube 162. A<br>
hollow shaft 188 is bent into a "Z" shape and has a distal portion 198 that is bent<br>
to form at an angle to the longitudinal axis. Distal portion 198 is rotatably<br>
mounted within a passageway 178 extending into the ball or convex member<br>
174 of the end effector. When the distal portion 198 is bent to the same angle as<br>
the passageway 178, the end effector and hollow shaft 188 can be assembled (in<br>
one position) aligning the longitudinal axis of the end effector with the hollow<br>
shaft 188. Rotation of the hollow shaft 188 from this alignment position<br>
articulates the end effector in a conical motion. As shown in FIGS. 10 13, the end<br>
effector both translates and rotates relative to the longitudinal axis. While<br>
providing articulation, the conical motion is not intuitive and requires<br>
rotation and repositioning of the surgical instrument to align the end effector<br>
with the tissue at a surgical site. What is needed is an articulation mechanism<br>
that can use rotation to articulate the end effector from side to side within a<br>
single plane relative to the longitudinal axis of the surgical instrument.<br>
Consequently, a significant need exists for an articulating surgical instrument<br>
that incorporates an articulation mechanism that responds to a control motion<br>
other than a longitudinal translation.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention overcomes the above-noted and other deficiencies of the prior art<br>
by providing a surgical instrument particularly suited to use through a trocar<br>
cannula passageway for endoscopic and laparoscopic clinical procedures.<br>
In one aspect of the invention, a surgical instrument has a handle portion that<br>
produces an actuating motion and a rotational motion that are transferred<br>
through a shaft to an end effector that is responsive to the actuating motion and<br>
to an articulation mechanism that is responsive in a geared fashion to the<br>
rotational motion. The articulation mechanism articulates the end effector from<br>
the longitudinal axis of the shaft so that the end effector may more effectively<br>
reach a surgical site and perform a diagnostic or therapeutic treatment by being<br>
actuated.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, a surgical instrument has a handle portion<br>
that produces a rotational motion that is transferred down a shaft. In particular,<br>
the shaft includes an articulation drive tube that is rotated by the rotational<br>
motion and that encompasses a frame. A gear section distally projecting about at<br>
least a portion of a circumference of a distal end of the articulation drive tube<br>
engages a spur gear on a pivot axis between the shaft and an end effector,<br>
converting the rotational motion of the articulation drive tube to an articulation<br>
motion pivoting the end effector from a longitudinal axis of the shaft. The hollow<br>
articulation drive tube creates an interior space suitable for incorporating various<br>
structures to communicate between the handle portion and the end effector,<br>
providing additional design options for various types of surgical instruments.<br>
In yet another aspect of the invention, a surgical instrument has a handle portion<br>
that produces a rotational motion. A shaft with a longitudinal axis includes an<br>
elongate frame attached to the handle portion and an articulation drive tube<br>
offset from the longitudinal axis of the shaft. The articulation drive tube is<br>
responsive to the rotational motion and includes a distal, exterior threaded<br>
portion. An end effector is distally and pivotally coupled to the frame at a pivot<br>
axis. A gear connection offset from the pivot axis and the longitudinal axis of the<br>
shaft engages the distal, exterior threaded portion of the articulation drive tube<br>
to convert the rotational motion of the articulation drive tube to an articulation<br>
motion pivoting the end effector from the longitudinal axis of the shaft.<br>
These and other objects and advantages of the present invention shall be made<br>
apparent from the accompanying drawings and the description thereof.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Turning to the Drawings, wherein like numerals denote like components<br>
throughout the several views, FIGS. 1 3 depict a surgical instrument, which in<br>
the illustrative embodiment is more particularly a surgical stapling and severing<br>
instrument 10, that is capable of practicing the unique benefits of the present<br>
invention. In particular, the surgical stapling and severing instrument 10 is sized<br>
for insertion, in a nonarticulated state as depicted in FIG. 1, through a trocar<br>
cannula passageway to a surgical site in a patient for performing a surgical<br>
procedure. Once an articulation mechanism 11 and a distally attached end<br>
effector 12 are inserted through the cannula passageway, the articulation<br>
mechanism 11 may be remotely articulated, as depicted in FIG. 2, by an<br>
articulation control 13. Thereby, the end effector 12 may reach behind an organ<br>
or approach tissue from a desired angle or for other reasons. For instance, a<br>
firing mechanism, advantageously depicted as an E-beam firing bar 14 (depicted<br>
in FIG. 3), that severs clamped tissue, engages an elongate channel 16 and a<br>
pivotally attached anvil 18.<br>
The surgical and stapling and severing instrument 10 includes a handle portion<br>
20 connected to an implement portion 22, the latter further comprising a shaft<br>
23 distally terminating in the articulating mechanism 11 and the end effector 12.<br>
The handle portion 20 includes a pistol grip 24 toward which a closure trigger 26<br>
is pivotally drawn by the clinician to cause clamping, or closing, of the anvil 18<br>
toward the elongate channel 16 of the end effector 12. A firing trigger 28 is<br>
farther outboard of the closure trigger 26 and is pivotally drawn by the clinician<br>
to cause the stapling and severing of clamped tissue in the end effector 12.<br>
Thereafter, a release button 30 is depressed to release the clamped tissue.<br>
An outmost closure sleeve 32 of the shaft 23 longitudinally translates in response<br>
to the closure trigger 26 to pivotally close the anvil 18. Specifically, a distal<br>
portion, or closure ring 33, of the closure sleeve 32 with respect to the<br>
articulation mechanism 11 is indirectly supported by a frame 34 of the implement<br>
portion 22 (partially visible at the articulation mechanism 11). At the articulation<br>
mechanism 11, a proximal portion, or closure tube 35, of the closure sleeve 32<br>
communicates with the distal portion (closure ring) 33. The frame 34 is flexibly<br>
attached to the elongate channel 16 via the articulation mechanism 11, enabling<br>
articulation in a single plane. The frame 34 also longitudinally slidingly supports a<br>
firing drive member 36 that communicates a firing motion from the firing trigger<br>
28 to the firing bar 14. Only the firing bar 14 of the firing drive member 36 is<br>
depicted FIG. 3, but the firing drive member 36 is described below further detail<br>
with regard to various versions of a rotationally controlled articulation<br>
mechanism 11.<br>
It will be appreciated that the terms "proximal" and "distal" are used herein with<br>
reference to a clinician gripping a handle of an instrument. Thus, the end<br>
effector 12 is distal with respect to the more proximal handle portion 20. It will<br>
be further appreciated that for convenience and clarity, spatial terms such as<br>
"vertical" and "horizontal" are used herein with respect to the drawings.<br>
However, surgical instruments are used in many orientations and positions, and<br>
these terms are not intended to be limiting and absolute.<br>
E-beam Firing Bar<br>
FIGS. 3 5 depict the end effector 12 employing the E-beam firing bar 14 to<br>
perform a number of functions. In FIG. 3, the firing bar 14 is proximally<br>
positioned, allowing an unspent staple cartridge 37 to be installed into the<br>
elongate channel 16. In particular, an upper pin 38 of the firing bar 14 resides<br>
within a recess, depicted as an anvil pocket 40 allowing the anvil 18 to be<br>
repeatedly opened and closed. With the end effector closed as depicted in FIG.<br>
4, the firing bar 14 is advanced in engagement with the anvil 18 by having the<br>
upper pin 38 enter a longitudinal anvil slot 42. A lower most pin, or firing bar cap<br>
44, engaged a lower surface of the elongate channel 16 by having the firing bar<br>
14 extend through a channel slot 45. A middle pin 46 slidingly engages a top<br>
surface of the elongate channel 16, cooperating with the firing bar cap 44.<br>
Thereby, the firing bar 14 affirmatively spaces the end effector 12 during firing,<br>
overcoming pinching that may occur with a minimal amount of clamped tissue<br>
and overcoming staple malformation with an excessive amount of clamped<br>
tissue.<br>
During firing, a distally presented cutting edge 48 between the upper pin 38 and<br>
middle pin 46 of the firing bar enters a proximally presented vertical slot 49 of<br>
the staple cartridge 37, severing tissue clamped between the staple cartridge 37<br>
and the anvil 18. As shown in FIG. 4, the middle pin 46 actuates the staple<br>
cartridge 37 by entering into a firing slot within the staple cartridge 37, driving a<br>
wedge sled 41 into upward camming contact with staple drivers 43 that in turn<br>
drive a plurality of staples 47 out of staple apertures 51 in the staple cartridge 37<br>
into forming contact with staple pockets 53 on an inner surface of the anvil 18.<br>
FIG. 5 depicts the firing bar 14 fully distally translated after completing severing<br>
and stapling tissue.<br>
Two-axis Handle<br>
With reference to FIGS. 6 7, the handle portion 20 is comprised of first and<br>
second base sections 50 and 52, which are molded from a polymeric material<br>
such as a glass-filled polycarbonate. The first base section 50 is provided with a<br>
plurality of cylindrical-shaped pins 54. The second base section 52 includes a<br>
plurality of extending members 56, each having a hexagonal-shaped opening 58.<br>
The cylindrical-shaped pins 54 are received within the hexagonal-shaped<br>
openings 58 and are frictionally held therein for maintaining the first and second<br>
base sections 50 and 52 in assembly.<br>
A housing cap 60 has a bore 62 extending completely through it for engaging<br>
and rotating the implement portion 22 about its longitudinal axis. The housing<br>
cap 60 includes an inwardly protruding boss 64 extending along at least a<br>
portion of the bore 62. The protruding boss 64 is received within a longitudinal<br>
slot 66 formed at a proximal portion of the closure sleeve 32 such that rotation<br>
of the housing cap 60 effects rotation of the closure sleeve 32. It will be<br>
appreciated that the boss 64 further extends through frame 34 and into contact<br>
with a portion of the firing drive member 36 to effect their rotation as well. Thus,<br>
the end effector 12 (not shown in FIGS. 3 4) rotates with the housing cap 60.<br>
A proximal end 68 of the frame 34 passes proximally through the housing cap 60<br>
and is provided with a circumferential notch 70 that is engaged by opposing<br>
channel securement members 72 extending respectively from the base sections<br>
50 and 52. Only the channel securement member 72 of the second base section<br>
52 is shown. The channel securement members 72 extending from the base<br>
sections 50, 52 serve to secure the frame 34 to the handle portion 20 such that<br>
the frame 34 does not move longitudinally relative to the handle portion 20.<br>
The closure trigger 26 has a handle section 74, a gear segment section 76, and<br>
an intermediate section 78. A bore 80 extends through the intermediate section<br>
78. A cylindrical support member 82 extending from the second base section 52<br>
passes through the bore 80 for pivotally mounting the closure trigger 26 on the<br>
handle portion 20. A second cylindrical support member 83 extending from the<br>
second base section 52 passes through a bore 81 of firing trigger 28 for pivotally<br>
mounting on the handle portion 20. A hexagonal opening 84 is provided in the<br>
cylindrical support member 83 for receiving a securement pin (not shown)<br>
extending from the first base section 50.<br>
A closure yoke 86 is housed within the handle portion 20 for reciprocating<br>
movement therein and serves to transfer motion from the closure trigger 26 to<br>
the closure sleeve 32. Support members 88 extending from the second base<br>
section 52 and securement member 72, which extends through a recess 89 in<br>
the yoke 86, support the yoke 86 within the handle portion 20.<br>
A proximal end 90 of the closure sleeve 32 is provided with a flange 92 that is<br>
snap-fitted into a receiving recess 94 formed in a distal end 96 of the yoke 86. A<br>
proximal end 98 of the yoke 86 has a gear rack 100 that is engaged by the gear<br>
segment section 76 of the closure trigger 26. When the closure trigger 26 is<br>
moved toward the pistol grip 24 of the handle portion 20, the yoke 86 and,<br>
hence, the closure sleeve 32 move distally, compressing a spring 102 that biases<br>
the yoke 86 proximally. Distal movement of the closure sleeve 32 effects pivotal<br>
translation movement of the anvil 18 distally and toward the elongate channel 16<br>
of the end effector 12 and proximal movement effects closing, as discussed<br>
below.<br>
The closure trigger 26 is forward biased to an open position by a front surface<br>
130 interacting with an engaging surface 128 of the firing trigger 28. Clamp first<br>
hook 104 that pivots top to rear in the handle portion 20 about a pin 106<br>
restrains movement of the firing trigger 28 toward the pistol grip 24 until the<br>
closure trigger 26 is clamped to its closed position. Hook 104 restrains firing<br>
trigger 28 motion by engaging a lockout pin 107 in firing trigger 28. The hook<br>
104 is also in contact with the closure trigger 26. In particular, a forward<br>
projection 108 of the hook 104 engages a member 110 on the intermediate<br>
section 78 of the closure trigger 26, the member 110 being outward of the bore<br>
80 toward the handle section 74. Hook 104 is biased toward contact with<br>
member 110 of the closure trigger 26 and engagement with lockout pin 107 in<br>
firing trigger 28 by a release spring 112. As the closure trigger 26 is depressed,<br>
the hook 104 is moved top to rear, compressing the release spring 112 that is<br>
captured between a rearward projection 114 on the hook 104 and a forward<br>
projection 116 on the release button 30.<br>
As the yoke 86 moves distally in response to proximal movement of the closure<br>
trigger 26, an upper latch arm 118 of the release button 30 moves along an<br>
upper surface 120 on the yoke 86 until dropping into an upwardly presented<br>
recess 122 in a proximal, lower portion of the yoke 86. The release spring 112<br>
urges the release button 30 outward, which pivots the upper latch arm 118<br>
downwardly into engagement with the upwardly presented recess 122, thereby<br>
locking the closure trigger 26 in a tissue clamping position.<br>
The latch arm 118 can be moved out of the recess 122 to release the anvil 18 by<br>
pushing the release button 30 inward. Specifically, the upper latch arm 118<br>
pivots upward about pin 123 of the second base section 52. The yoke 86 is then<br>
permitted to move proximally in response to return movement of the closure<br>
trigger 26.<br>
A firing trigger return spring 124 is located within the handle portion 20 with one<br>
end attached to pin 106 of the second base section 52 and the other end<br>
attached to a pin 126 on the firing trigger 28. The firing return spring 124 applies<br>
a return force to the pin 126 for biasing the firing trigger 28 in a direction away<br>
from the pistol grip 24 of the handle portion 20. The closure trigger 26 is also<br>
biased away from pistol grip 24 by engaging surface 128 of firing trigger 28<br>
biasing front surface 130 of closure trigger 26.<br>
As the closure trigger 26 is moved toward the pistol grip 24, its front surface 130<br>
engages with the engaging surface 128 on the firing trigger 28 causing the firing<br>
trigger 28 to move to its "firing" position. When in its firing position, the firing<br>
trigger 28 is located at an angle of approximately 45° to the pistol grip 24. After<br>
staple firing, the spring 124 causes the firing trigger 28 to return to its initial<br>
position. During the return movement of the firing trigger 28, its engaging<br>
surface 128 pushes against the front surface 130 of the closure trigger 26<br>
causing the closure trigger 26 to return to its initial position. A stop member 132<br>
extends from the second base section 52 to prevent the closure trigger 26 from<br>
rotating beyond its initial position.<br>
The surgical stapling and severing instrument 10 additionally includes a<br>
reciprocating section 134, a multiplier 136 and a drive member 138. The<br>
reciprocating section 134 comprises a wedge sled, or wedge sled, in the<br>
implement portion 22 (not shown in FIG. 6 7) and a metal drive rod 140.<br>
The drive member 138 includes first and second gear racks 141 and 142. A first<br>
notch 144 is provided on the drive member 138 intermediate the first and second<br>
gear racks 141, 142. During return movement of the firing trigger 28, a tooth<br>
146 on the firing trigger 28 engages with the first notch 144 for returning the<br>
drive member 138 to its initial position after staple firing. A second notch 148 is<br>
located at a proximal end of the metal drive rod 140 for locking the metal drive<br>
rod 140 to the upper latch arm 118 of the release button 30 in its unfired<br>
position.<br>
The multiplier 136 comprises first and second integral pinion gears 150 and 152.<br>
The first integral pinion gear 150 is engaged with a first gear rack 154 provided<br>
on the metal drive rod 140. The second integral pinion gear 152 is engaged with<br>
the first gear rack 141 on the drive member 138. The first integral pinion gear<br>
150 has a first diameter and the second integral pinion gear 152 has a second<br>
diameter that is smaller than the first diameter.<br>
Rotational Articulation Control<br>
With reference to FIGS. 6 9, the handle portion 20 advantageously incorporates<br>
the articulation control 13 that both rotates the implement portion 22 about the<br>
longitudinal axis of the surgical instrument 10 and articulates the end effector 12<br>
to an angle with the longitudinal axis. A hollow articulation drive tube 200 is<br>
concentrically located within the closure sleeve 32 and is operably coupled to an<br>
actuation lever 202 such that rotation of actuation lever 202 rotates tube 200<br>
about the longitudinal axis and causes perpendicular rotation or articulation of<br>
the closure ring 250 and end effector 12. This articulation of the closure ring 250<br>
corresponds to the degree and direction of rotation of actuator lever 202 viewed<br>
and manipulated by the clinician. In the illustrative version, the relationship is<br>
one to one, with the degree of rotation of the actuator lever 202 corresponding<br>
to the degree of articulation from the longitudinal axis of the shaft 23, thus<br>
providing an intuitive indication to the clinician. It will be appreciated that other<br>
angular relationships may be selected.<br>
The articulation control 13 includes a pair of mirrored articulation transmission<br>
housings 204 that are attached to the housing cap 60. Moreover, the articulation<br>
transmission housing 204 includes longitudinally aligned external tabs 206 that a<br>
clinician twists to effect rotation of the articulation transmission housing 204, and<br>
thus of the end effector 12, about the longitudinal axis of the implement portion<br>
22. The actuator lever 202 is attached to a cylindrical articulation body 208 that<br>
resides within a cylindrical recess 210 opening generally upward and<br>
perpendicular to the shaft 23. The lowermost portion of the articulation body 208<br>
includes prongs 212 that snap fit into an opening 214 in the articulation<br>
transmission housing 208 near to the shaft 23, the prongs 212 preventing the<br>
articulation body 208 from being withdrawn from the cylindrical recess 210.<br>
Annularly presented gear teeth 216 are located about the lower portion of the<br>
articulation body 208 and mesh with teeth 218 on an articulation yoke 220. The<br>
articulation yoke 220 straddles an articulation rectangular window 222 formed in<br>
the closure sleeve 32. Closure sleeve 32 is slidably moveable within the<br>
articulation control 13 (in the longitudinal direction) to close and open the end<br>
effector 12. The articulation drive tube 200 moves longitudinally with the closure<br>
sleeve 32 relative to the fixed articulation control 13. Window 222 provides<br>
clearance for a boss 224 inwardly presented from the articulation yoke 220 that<br>
passes through the rectangular window 222 to engage a slot 226 in the<br>
articulation drive tube 200, longitudinally positioning the articulation drive tube<br>
200 for rotational motion. The hollow articulation drive tube 200 extends<br>
longitudinally within the closure sleeve 32 from the articulation mechanism 11<br>
and terminates distally before the locking tabs 227 of the closure sleeve 32. The<br>
tabs 227 are inwardly bent behind the proximal face of the articulation drive tube<br>
200 and thereby retaining the articulation drive tube 200 in the shaft 23.<br>
It should be appreciated that the articulation transmission housing 204 is<br>
operatively associated to the closure tube 35 of the shaft 23. The housing cap 60<br>
retains the articulation yoke 220 in the articulation transmission housing 204 and<br>
retains the articulation control 13 within the handle portion 20 by presenting<br>
proximally an outer diameter circular groove 228 that engages a circular inward<br>
lip 230 at the distal opening of the assembled base sections 50, 52.<br>
FIGS. 10 and 11 depict the gear articulation mechanism 11 of FIGS. 1 2 in the<br>
form of a spur gear articulation mechanism 240, which is generally the same as<br>
described above but with additional articulation driving components on the other<br>
side of the articulation mechanism 240 to thereby increase performance.<br>
Articulation mechanism 240 has a rotatable hollow articulation drive tube 242<br>
that is concentrically located within closure sleeve 32 and has a distally<br>
projecting gear section 244 about a first circumference portion 246. Gear section<br>
244 meshes with a spur gear 248 attached to and proximally projecting from<br>
closure ring 250 which pivots about pins 253 extending through first and second<br>
pivot points 252, 260 projecting distally from the closure sleeve 32. Thus, an<br>
articulation pivot axis passes through both the first and second pivot points 252,<br>
260 and pins 253 rotatably couple closure ring 250 to the closure sleeve 32.<br>
Rotation of drive 242 engages the gears 242 and 248 and articulates closure ring<br>
250 about first and second pivot points 252, 260.<br>
To increase the effective surface area of gear contact between the hollow<br>
articulation drive tube 242 and the closure ring 250, a second circumference<br>
portion 254 of the hollow articulation drive tube 242 has a recessed distally<br>
projecting gear section 256 extending therefrom. Gear section 256 is operably<br>
coupled to a second spur gear 258 attached to and proximally projecting from an<br>
opposite lateral side of the closure ring 250 by a reversing gear 262 pivotally<br>
supported by the frame 34. Reversing gear 262 engages both the recessed<br>
distally projecting gear section 256 on one side and the second spur gear 258 of<br>
the closure ring 250 on the other.<br>
When the closure trigger 26 is actuated, both the hollow articulation drive tube<br>
242 and pivotally attached closure tube 250 of the closure sleeve 32 are moved<br>
distally to close the anvil 18. The closure tube 35 of the closure sleeve 32 is<br>
spaced away from the closure ring 33 by pivot points 252, 260 pinned to pivot<br>
holes 264 and 266 centered in spur gears 248, 258, and a frame opening 268<br>
that extends therethrough. The frame opening 268 provides clearance so that<br>
the proximal edges of the closure ring 33 and the distal edges of the closure<br>
tube 35 of the closure sleeve 32 do not collide during articulation.<br>
FIG. 11 depicts in disassembled form an implement portion 270 that includes the<br>
spur gear articulation mechanism 240. A frame 272 is longitudinally attachable to<br>
the handle portion 20 (depicted in FIGS. 1 and 2) with a bushing 274 on its<br>
proximal end for rotatingly engagement thereto. A frame trough 276 formed by<br>
an opening 278 longitudinally aligned with the center of the frame 272 is longer<br>
than a firing connector 280 that slides longitudinally within the frame trough 276.<br>
The proximal end of the firing connector 280 rotatingly engages the distal end of<br>
the metal drive bar 140 (depicted in FIG. 6). The distal end of the firing<br>
connector 280 includes a slot 282 that receives a proximal end of the firing bar<br>
14, attached therein by pins 284. A more distal portion of the firing bar 14 is<br>
positioned within a lower groove 286 in a firing bar slotted guide 288 that is<br>
distally engaged with an articulating frame member 290 and the frame 272.<br>
Articulating frame member 290 has a channel-anchoring member 292 that<br>
distally attaches to an attachment collar 294 of a proximal portion in the<br>
elongate channel 16. The firing bar 14 passes through a lower slot 295 in the<br>
articulating frame member 290. The articulating frame member 290 is spaced<br>
away from the distal end of the frame 272 by the firing bar slotted guide 288<br>
and flexibly attached thereto for articulation by a resilient connector 296. A<br>
widened proximal end 298 of the resilient connector 296 engages a distally<br>
communicating top recess 300 in the distal end of the frame 272 and a widened<br>
distal end 302 of the resilient connector 296 engages a proximally<br>
communicating top recess 304 in the articulating frame member 290. Thereby,<br>
the elongate channel 16 is attached to the handle portion 20, albeit with a<br>
flexible portion therebetween.<br>
The elongate channel 16 also has an anvil cam slot 306 that pivotally receives an<br>
anvil pivot 308 of the anvil 18. The closure ring 250 that encompasses the<br>
articulating frame member 290 includes a distally presented tab 310 that<br>
engages an anvil feature 312 proximate but distal to the anvil pivot 308 on the<br>
anvil 18 to thereby effect opening. When the closure ring 250 is moved forward,<br>
its distally presented closing face 314 contacts a ramped cylindrical closing face<br>
316, which is distal to tab 312 of the anvil 18. This camming action closes the<br>
anvil 18 downward until the closing face 314 of the closure ring 250 contacts a<br>
flat cylindrical face 318 of the anvil 18.<br>
Snaggle Tooth Articulation Mechanism<br>
FIGS. 12 13 depict an alternative articulation mechanism 350 for the surgical<br>
stapling and severing instrument 10 of FIG. 1. A snaggle gear connection 352 is<br>
formed therein by positioning a single spur gear 354 of a closure ring 250 (not<br>
depicted in FIGS. 12 13) to the longitudinal axis of the closure ring 250. The<br>
snaggle gear connection 352 is completed by slanted teeth 356 formed at a<br>
distal end 358 of a closure tube 360. Pairs of slanted teeth 356 slope toward<br>
each other registered to one side of the spur gear 354 with other pairs of slanted<br>
teeth 356 sloping toward the other side of the spur gear 354. This snaggle gear<br>
connection 352 achieves a high gear ratio with a relatively large degree of<br>
articulation for a given amount of rotation motion about the longitudinal axis by<br>
the closure tube 360. It should be appreciated that a various types of<br>
interconnections between a shaft and an end effector may be positioned around<br>
the articulation mechanism 350 or about each face of the spur gear 354.<br>
Worm Gear Articulation Mechanism<br>
FIG. 14 depicts a worm gear articulation mechanism 370 for the surgical stapling<br>
and severing instrument 10 of FIG. 1. A closure ring 372 is depicted partially<br>
cutaway to expose two articulation 374, 376, each offset laterally from the<br>
longitudinal axis of a closure tube 378. The closure ring 372 is pivotally<br>
connected at pivot points 380, 382 extending from the closure tube 378, the<br>
pivot points 380, 382 defining a pivot axis. A concave face spur gear 384 of<br>
hourglass shape is aligned with the pivot axis and attached to the closure ring<br>
372. Concave face spur gear 384 is pivoting about an internal pivot point 386<br>
distally projecting from the closure tube 378. Each articulation drive tube 374,<br>
376 includes worm gear teeth 388 encompassing at least their distal portions<br>
that enmesh with opposite sides of the concave face spur gear 384. Thus, by<br>
counter-rotating the two articulation drive tubes 374, 376, about the longitudinal<br>
axis, the closure ring 372, and thus the end effector 12 (not shown in FIG. 14) is<br>
articulated about the pivot axis.<br>
It will be appreciated that only one articulating drive tube 374, 376 may be used.<br>
In addition, in application wherein a cavity 390 for a firing bar 14 is not required,<br>
it will be appreciated that the concave face spur gear 384 may be centered on<br>
the pivot axis rather than offset as depicted. Moreover, although a concave face<br>
of hourglass shaped spur gear 384 achieves a large contact area with the<br>
articulation drive tubes 374, 376, straight or other shaped faces may be used.<br>
Furthermore, the articulation drive tubes 274, 376 may be solid or hollow.<br>
Bevel Gear Articulation Mechanism<br>
FIGS. 15 17 depict a bevel gear articulation mechanism 400 for the surgical<br>
stapling and severing instrument 10 of FIG. 1 that also produces articulation<br>
from rotation of a member about the longitudinal axis. Instead of achieving<br>
greater strength in the gear connection by inclusion of a reversing gear, snaggle<br>
tooth gear, or a worm gear type of connection, a bevel gear section 402 is<br>
provided that is coupled to an articulation drive tube 404. In FIG. 15, drive tube<br>
404 is shown sectioned to show elements within. Bevel gear section 402 of tube<br>
404 meshes with a bevel spur gear 406 formed from a closure ring 408.<br>
With particular reference to FIG. 16, an implement portion 410 is depicted<br>
having additional advantages, such as the bevel gear articulation mechanism 400<br>
including attachable portions, specifically a pivot connection 414 and the bevel<br>
gear section 402, that are not formed respectively into a closure tube 416 or the<br>
articulation drive tube 404, thereby simplifying manufacturing processes when<br>
facilitating a shaft 418 of selectable lengths. In addition, the assembly of the<br>
bevel gear section 402 to a separate articulation drive tube 404 allows for a<br>
constriction 420 inside the bevel gear section 402 to be confined to only that<br>
portion of the shaft 418 adjacent to bevel gear section 402.<br>
A resilient support section 422 couples a frame 424 distally to the end effector 12<br>
through this constriction 420. A proximal end 426 of the frame 424 is<br>
longitudinally positioned to the handle portion 20 (not depicted in FIGS. 15 17)<br>
for rotatingly engagement thereto. A frame trough 428 formed by an opening<br>
430 longitudinally aligned along the longitudinal axis of the frame 424 is longer<br>
than a firing connector 432 that slides longitudinally within the frame trough 428.<br>
A proximal end 434 of the firing connector 432 rotatingly engages the distal end<br>
of the metal drive bar 140 (FIG. 6). The distal end of the firing connector 432<br>
includes a slot 436 that receives a proximal end 438 of the firing bar 14,<br>
attached therein by pins (not shown).<br>
The more distal portions of the firing bar 14 extend through the frame 424 out<br>
through a widened slot 440, guided on each lateral side by the resilient support<br>
section 422. In particular, flexible right half and left halves 442, 444 each include<br>
a proximal tab 446 that are insertable into the widened slot 440 of the frame<br>
424. Defined into the opposing faces of the two flexible halves 442,444 of the<br>
resilient support section 422 is a firing bar guide 448 and a cylindrical rod recess<br>
450 that receives a flexible rod 452. A rigid guide member 454, which is engaged<br>
with a distal recess 456 formed into the distal faces of both flexible halves 442,<br>
444, includes a vertical slot 458 capped by a cylindrical hole 460 longitudinally<br>
aligned to receive respectively the firing bar 14 and the flexible rod 452.<br>
An articulating frame member 462 has channel anchoring features 464 that<br>
engage an attachment collar 466 of a proximal portion in the elongate channel<br>
16. The firing bar 14 passes through a lower slot 468 in the articulating frame<br>
member 462. The articulating frame member 462 is spaced away from the distal<br>
end of the resilient support section 422 by being attached to a distal end 470 of<br>
the flexible rod 452. Thereby, the elongate channel 16 is attached to the handle<br>
portion 20, albeit with a flexible portion for articulation motion therebetween.<br>
The elongate channel 16 also has an anvil cam slot 472 that pivotally receives an<br>
anvil pivot 474 of the anvil 18. The closure ring 408 that encompasses the frame<br>
424 includes a distally presented tab 476 that engages an anvil feature 478<br>
proximate but distal to the anvil pivot 474 on the anvil 18 to thereby effect<br>
opening and closing of the anvil 18.<br>
The articulation drive tube 404 encompasses the frame 424 and is distally<br>
attached to the bevel gear section 402, which in turn encompasses the proximal<br>
tabs 446 of the flexible right half and left halves 442,444. The bevel gear section<br>
402 enmeshes with the bevel spur gear 406 of the closure ring 408, as depicted<br>
in FIG. 17. The closure tube 416 is distally attached to the pivot connection 414,<br>
which in turn presents distally projecting and laterally opposing tabs 480, 482<br>
that pivotally attach respectively to pivot points 484, 486 of the closure ring 408.<br>
Flex-neck Articulation Mechanism<br>
FIGS. 18 19 depict a flex-neck articulation mechanism 500 for the surgical<br>
instrument 10 of FIG. 1 that also employs a rotational articulation motion about<br>
the longitudinal axis to effect the articulation of an end effector 12 (not depicted<br>
in FIGS. 18 19). Unlike known flex-neck articulation mechanism, the rotation<br>
articulation motion provides a smooth and continuous positioning capability.<br>
In particular, a resilient flex-neck body 502 includes a firing bar slot 504 through<br>
its longitudinal axis to receive the firing bar 14 (not depicted in FIGS. 18 19). A<br>
series of parallel right-hand and left-hand slots 506, 508 projecting inward in<br>
opposite direction into the flex-neck body 502 enable articulation to the left and<br>
right, perpendicular to the firing bar slot 504. Right-hand and left-hand<br>
cylindrical passages 510, 512 are offset from the longitudinal axis of the flex-<br>
neck body 502 and are formed respectively into the resulting right-hand and left-<br>
hand fins 514, 516 formed by the right-hand and left-hand slots 506, 508.<br>
A distal face 518 of the flex-neck body 502 is located at the most distal of the<br>
right-hand and left-hand fins 510, 512. Distal face 518 includes gear connection<br>
capabilities to convert the rotational articulation motion of right-hand and left-<br>
hand articulation tubes, depicted as threaded rods 520, 522, into an articulation<br>
motion. Specifically, threaded nuts 524, 526 are attached to each side<br>
respectively on the distal face 518. In the illustrative version, each threaded nut<br>
524, 526 includes a pair of laterally projecting pins 528 that snap respectively<br>
into gripping fingers 530 to prevent rotation of threaded nuts 524,526. When the<br>
threaded nuts 524,526 are threaded in the same direction, such as left hand or<br>
right hand threads, the threaded rods 520 and 522 must be rotated in opposite<br>
directions to articulate the flex neck body 502. As threaded rods 520, 522 are<br>
rotated in opposite directions, one nut 524, 526 moves proximally and one nut<br>
524,526 moves distally. The proximally moving nut 524 or 526 shortens the<br>
portion of the threaded rod 516, 518 proximal to the threaded nut 524, 526, thus<br>
compressing the corresponding right-hand or left-hand slots 506, 508.<br>
Operation<br>
A closed end effector 12 and shaft 23 of an implement portion 22 of a surgical<br>
stapling and severing instrument 10 are inserted through a cannula passageway<br>
of a trocar to a surgical site for an endoscopic or laparoscopic procedure. The<br>
articulation control 13 is rotated as desired about the longitudinal axis of the<br>
shaft 23 to effect a corresponding rotation of the end effector 12.<br>
Advantageously, the actuator lever 202 of the articulation control 13 is pivoted to<br>
create a rotation articulation motion about the longitudinal axis of surgical<br>
instrument 10 in an articulation drive tube 200, 242, 374, 520 that is converted<br>
into an articulation motion at a geared connection in an articulation mechanism<br>
11, 240, 370, 400, 500, thereby positioning the end effector 12 in a desired<br>
position.<br>
While the present invention has been illustrated by description of several<br>
embodiments and while the illustrative embodiments have been described in<br>
considerable detail, it is not the intention of the applicant to restrict or in any<br>
way limit the scope of the appended claims to such detail. Additional advantages<br>
and modifications may readily appear to those skilled in the art.<br>
For example, the present invention has been discussed in terms of endoscopic<br>
procedures and apparatus. However, use herein of terms such as "endoscopic",<br>
should not be construed to limit the present invention to a surgical stapling and<br>
severing instrument for use only in conjunction with an endoscopic tube (i.e.,<br>
trocar). On the contrary, it is believed that the present invention may find use in<br>
any procedure where access is limited to a small incision, including but not<br>
limited to laparoscopic procedures, as well as open procedures.<br>
For another example, although the E-beam firing beam 14 has advantages for an<br>
endoscopically employed surgical severing and stapling instrument 10, a similar<br>
E-beam may be used in other clinical procedures. It is generally accepted that<br>
endoscopic procedures are more common than laparoscopic procedures.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention has been discussed in terms of endoscopic<br>
procedures and apparatus. However, use herein of terms such as "endoscopic",<br>
should not be construed to limit the present invention to a surgical stapling and<br>
severing instrument for use only in conjunction with an endoscopic tube (i.e.,<br>
trocar). On the contrary, it is believed that the present invention may find use in<br>
any procedure where access is limited to a small incision, including but not<br>
limited to laparoscopic procedures, as well as open procedures.<br>
For yet another example, although an illustrative handle portion 20 described<br>
herein is manually operated by a clinician, it is consistent with aspects of the<br>
invention for some or all of the functions of a handle portion to be powered<br>
(e.g., pneumatic, hydraulic, electromechanical, ultrasonic, etc.). Furthermore,<br>
controls of each of these functions may be manually presented on a handle<br>
portion or be remotely controlled (e.g., wireless remote, automated remote<br>
console, etc.).<br>
As yet an additional example, although a simultaneous stapling and severing<br>
instrument is advantageously illustrated herein, it would be consistent with<br>
aspects of the invention rotationally controlled articulation with other types of<br>
end effectors, such as grasper, cutter, staplers, clip applier, access device,<br>
drug/gene therapy delivery device, and a energy device using ultrasound, RF,<br>
laser, etc.<br>

member (14) and configured to transfer a rotational motion about a<br>
longitudinal axis thereof;<br>
