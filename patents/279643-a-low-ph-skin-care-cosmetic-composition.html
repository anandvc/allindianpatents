				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a skin care composition, and more specifically, relates to a stable low pH cosmetic skin care composition comprising of cationic salt of amido amine, high molecular weight fatty acid and optionally involving non-ionic emulsifiers with improved sensory properties such as the sensory properties of vanishing creams and the like. most advantageously, the Incorporation of the higher molecular weight fatty acids and cationic salts of amido amine favours in attaining the desired sensory profile of the said skin care composition of the present invention and beneficially aid In incorporating higher levels of skin benefiting actives including acidic skin care actives in association with cosmetically acceptable vehicle in skin care formulations and yet be stable.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
There is an increasing demand nowadays for skin compatible cosmetic preparations with lower irritancy and sensorial properties equivalent to vanishing cream. The traditionally used vanishing cream is dominated with high levels of fatty acid and alkali metal soap as an emulsifier which is important for physical stability of the product. However the presence of soap Increases the pH value of the product and the cosmetic composition becomes alkaline. Such a product is stable only under alkaline condition.<br>
The surfaces of human skin are normally having pH of 4.0- 6.0, Upon contact with an alkaline substance, the skin secretes acidic substances to restore the normal pH lvalue. This process results in disturbance to the skin physiology and causes secretions such as sebum, sweat etc. resulting in skin irritation. Accordingly, it is desired that cosmetics such as creams, lotions etc. when applied to the skin are conditioned to be weakly acidic or to be of neutral pH while maintaining the characteristics of the traditional vanishing cream. On incorporation of acidic skin benefiting agent such as the alpha and beta hydroxy acids, the said anionic fatty soap emulsifier gets dissociated to its corresponding fatty acid and alkali metal salt of acidic skin benefiting agents. This in turn results in drop in pH and thereby causes physical instability. The lack of physical stability of the fatty acid soap emulsified vanishing creams at low pH is a disadvantage that restricts the use of valuable acidic beneficial actives, such as alpha-beta hydroxy carboxylic acids, because the said beneficial acidic actives dissociate tlie fatty acid soap emulsifier and adds to the Instability of the composition.<br>
A wide variety of acidic skin benefiting compounds such as hydroxy acids are used In i the formulations of vanishing cream, stabilized with anionic and non Ionic emulsifier.<br>
US Patent 6979452 B2 (Yan Zhou, et al) discloses low pH, high skin friction cosmetic cream containing solid asymmetric particles, an anionic emulsifier and a cosmetically<br>
I acceptable vehicle. It describes the extensive use of ethoxyiated non-ionic surfactants such as ethoxyiated aikyi ether, ethoxyiated sorbitan esters, ethoxyiated<br>
; fatty alcohols and ethoxyiated fatty acid esters. The anionic emuisifiers are selected from sulphates, sulphonates, succinates, isothionates, sarcosinates and taurates.<br>
I Sodium cetostearyl sulphate has been used as an exemplary anionic emulsifier in the said prior art and the acidic skin benefit agents encompasses alpha &amp; beta hydroxy acids namely glycollc, lactic and salicylic acid. Although these compositions are described to be stable at low pH giving desired sensory properties, the irritancy level of emuisifiers have not been realized.<br>
It is known that sulphates and sulphonates based anionic emuisifiers exhibit a high irritancy potential as also mentioned in US patent 4,536,519 by Suzuki et al., wherein an emulsified system prepared with a higher levels of alcohol sulphate has a drawback of imparting excessively high Irritations to the skin along with the instability that is imparted to such systems due to gradual hydrolysis of the said alcohol sulphate with time. Uses of Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) derived nonionic emuisifiers also increase the risk of skin irritation. The cumulative irritancy of the<br>
I said emuisifiers present along with other skin benefiting agents are thus often<br>
 discouraged from usage in such skin care compositions and particularly discouraged for those having sensitive skin. Therefore it is a long felt need to provide for a composition pertaining to skin care that is not only stable at low pH but has desired sensory characteristics along with a reduced risk of skin Irritations due to the presence of the emuisifiers in such skin care compositions.<br>
US  patent  6,153,177   (Bartolone et al.)  discloses vanishing  creams which  are<br>
formulated to Include alkali or alkaline earth metal salts of alpha-hydroxy carboxylic<br>
 acids In order to achieve skin lightening properties having pH of above 5. The salts of<br>
alpha- hydroxy carboxylic acids and not the direct acids were incorporated In the said<br>
 <br>
I prior art to avoid instability in emulsions. The said salt of the acidic skin benefiting agents thus reduces the efficacy of the acidic sl(in benefiting agents.<br>
U.S Patent 4, 536,519 (Suzuki et al.) uses a neutralized phosphoric ester as an emulsifler, a nonionic surfactant with HLB less than six and fatty components at neutral or weakly acidic pH. These compositions lack the sensory characteristics that are due to the lack of proper emulsifler systems.<br>
WO 01/70188 (Dwiwahyu et al.) disclose a low pH (1-6.5) non-acid soap vanishing ' cream with enhanced stability and skin benefit properties. A C8-C22 fatty acid substituted saccharide is used to stabilize the low pH stearic acid based vanishing cream. These compositions again lack the sensory characteristics due to the lack of proper emulsifler systems.<br>
As apparent, the above discussed prior art describes the extensive use of anionic and non-ionic emulsifler to maintain the stability of the skin care compositions containing high molecular weight fatty acid to give vanishing cream like feel . Anionic emulsifler carries a negative charge; tend to raise the skin pH above its normal value 4.0 to 6.0. Anionic emulsiflers have been demonstrated to cause damage to the stratum corneum barrier wherein SLS (sodium lauryl sulphate) in being an anionic surfactant is used as positive control In skin irritancy tests.<br>
Skin care compositions containing cationic emulsiflers are well known due to the unique sensory profile that these emulsiflers provide at lower pH. They carry positive charge and are thus advantageous in light of the negatively charged characteristic of the skin. Cationic emulsiflers provide a smooth powdery feel and allow incorporating high level of active ingredients in the composition and increased active ingredient delivery to the skin because of its cationic nature (Klus Jenny &amp; Anna Howe, Soaps Perfumery 8i Cosmetics April 2008).<br>
Chang et al. in US patent application 2008/0020005A1 discloses a composition containing a nonionic, cationic emulsifler combination and polar emollient system to reduce the irritancy of Alpha Hydroxy acid ( AHA) and also to enable the sustained release of AHA. The disadvantage of the composition rests with the polar emollient system selected for this composition that does not impart vanishing cream iii<e characteristics to the said sicin care composition.></e>
Epstein et al. in US Patent 5759558 is directed to a cationic emulsifier in oil-in-water emulsion incorporated in the composition that is well accepted and popular in marlcet for its excellent tactile properties of the said composition, marketed under the brand CUREL by Bausch and Lomb. The said patent also describes composition containing an AHA (Alpha Hydroxy Acid), cationic emulsifier, mineral oil and petrolatum used for moisturizing and giving conditioning benefits to the skin. The disadvantage of the composition lies in the absence of vanishing cream like characteristics due to selection of mineral oil base which gives the shiny and oily look to the skin.<br>
Struewing in US patent 5654341 discloses a low pH skin treatment composition ; containing cationic surfactant, fatty acid and hydrocarbon component in oil-in-water ] emulsion. It further describes addition of fatty acid to the cationic surfactant to form a complex which prevents the cationic surfactant from irritating the skin, and at the same time reduces the pH of the composition but does not provide any vanishing cream like sensory characteristics due to the complete reaction of fatty acid with cationic surfactant.<br>
It would be clearly apparent from the above existing state of the art and related discussions that although several efficacious skin care compositions are known, it is difficult to provide for compositions which could strike the baldbetween the vanishing characteristics of the said skin care composition in association to the reduced level of skin irritancy, unique sensory profile at lower pH and increased active ingredient delivery to the skin.<br>
Thus as is evident, there is a strong need in the art to provide for a balanced cosmetic skin care composition that would Include important skin care actives such as alpha &amp; beta hydroxy acids and in spite of such inclusion of the said actives would possess compatible pH, would further possess compatible pH in spite of the use of bther acidic ingredients, and would yet further possess required sensory properties like those of vanishing creams with low skin irritancy potential.<br>
 <br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is thus the basic object of the present invention to provide a iow pH skin care composition comprising catlonic salt of amido amine, high molecular weight fatty acid and optionally one or more of non-ionic emulsifier, that would enable incorporation of other skin benefiting acid ingredients in skin care cosmetic compositions to impart improved sensory properties such as the sensory properties of vanishing cream to the said skin care composition.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide for a balanced skin care ; cosmetic composition with skin compatible pH even on the inclusion of high level of free fatty acids along with skin care actives such as alpha &amp; beta hydroxy acids with required sensory properties like those of vanishing creams, and with low skin irritancy potential.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is directed to provide low pH skin care cosmetic composition that would facilitate the restriction of the skin pH within the beneficial range unlike the skin care compositions comprising anionic surfactants whereby the skin pH rises above its normal value due to the incorporation of such said anionic surfactants.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide said skin care cosmetic compositions with low pH comprising catlonic salt of amido amine to thereby replace the anionic emulsifiers in the said composition along with its associated disadvantages further comprising additional high molecular weight fatty acid ingredient such as free fatty acids attributing vanishing cream like sensory properties.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to provide such said skin care cosmetic compositions with low pH, comprising catlonic salt of amido amine, high molecular weight fatty acid ingredients further in combination with acidic skin benefiting actives such as alpha and beta hydroxy acids.<br>
Still another object of the invention is to provide for stable skin care cosmetic compositions with low pH comprising emulsifier such as catlonic salt of amido amine which is formed insitu and optionaily one or more non-ionic emulsifier, in addition to the above said ingredients to attain the desired sensory profile of the said skin care composition that further aids in incorporating higher levels of skin benefiting actives and yet be stable with low skin irritancy.<br>

Except where otherwise explicitly indicated, all numbers in this description indicating amounts of materials or conditions of reaction, physical properties of materials ; and/or use are to be understood as modified by the word "about".   All amounts are by weight of the compositions, unless otherwise specified.<br>
The term "skin" as used herein Includes the skin on the face, neck, chest, back, arms, hands, legs and scalp.<br>
Preferred cosmetic compositions are those suitable for the application to skin, which optionally, but preferably, include a skin benefiting agent.<br>
As discussed herein before, the present Invention is directed to provide for a stable lower irritancy skin care cosmetic compositions having skin friendly pH of below 6.0 involving skin compatible emulsifiers. An emulsifier system accomplished by way of the present invention have effectively overcome the stated prior art problems in rendering such a stable, low pH, low Irritancy, vanishing cream like skin care cosmetic composition insplte of high level incorporation of high molecular weight fatty acid Ingredients with vanishing attributes and acidic skin benefiting actives.<br>
Thus according to an important aspect of the invention, the same provides for an emulsifier system comprising salt of cationic amido amine selected from amido amine group R -C(0)-NH(CH2)n - R wherein R = C7 - C23 Aliphatic hydrocarbon radical, R = dialkyiamino or a heterocyclic amino group and n = 2, 3 preferably C16-C22 alkyl amidopropyl dimethyl amine and optionally   one or more non-ionic emulsifier for incorporations of highier ieveis of liigli moiecuiar weiglit fatty acid ingredients in sl<in care cosmetic compositions of preferably ph below with improved stability and sensory properties such as the vanishing cream.></in>
In accordance with another aspect of the invention there is provided a process for the preparation of the skin care composition with improved sensory properties as that of vanishing cream of pH preferably below 6 comprising (I) providing a separate mix of oil soluble ingredients including emollients, sunscreens, preservatives, antioxidants, high molecular weight fatty acids, waxes and any other oil soluble dispersible ingredients and heating the mixture up to 78(II) providing a separate mix of water soluble/ dispersible ingredients along with an an emulsifier system in water phase comprising a) taking amido amine (s) and neutralizing the said amido amine(s) in-situ at 70°C to 80*»C with at least one low molecular weight inorganic or organic acidic neutralizer to form the respective cationic salt and b) optionally adding at least one non-ionic emulsifier (s) at the same temperature and obtaining the said emulsifier system and then incorporate other water soluble/ dispersible ingredients such as moisturizer, chelating agents, fillers or inorganic pigments, (III) preparing the emulsion between 70  to 80 , preferably about 70  to 75 by mixing the mix of step I into mix of step II under high speed mixing followed by homogenization; (IV) cooling the mixture to preferably below  to add alpha /beta hydroxyl acids and /or other sicin benefiting agents followed by addition of perfume at 40 and obtaining the said vanishing cream composition thereof.<br>
The said sidn care composition of the invention thus incorporates the below mentioned skin care ingredients discussed hereunder:<br>
Amido amine:<br>
Human skin has a normal pH generally in range of 4.0- 6.0. Any soap based health and beauty cream tend to raise sicin plH above its normal range. The skin acts as a general buffer zone protecting against outside agents and a change in plH may hamper or limit the ability of the skin to provide its protective functions. Cationic ; emulsifier exhibit acidic pH values and are suitable for preserving the natural pH of I the human skin. The pH of the system has high influence on the properties of the cationic emulsifiers and at low plH values; cations are more strongly adsorbed than at higher pH value.<br>
 <br>
When an emulsifier containing the hydrophobic long chain group has a positive<br>
charge then the compounds are Icnown as cationic emulsifier.<br>
Cationic emulsifiers when used as primary emulsifiers add to the versatility of<br>
secondary emulsifiers in complex formulations. Even at low levels, consumers notice<br>
the sensory profile of cationic moieties.<br>
Cationic surface active chemicals are able to aid the adsorption of the active<br>
ingredients from the emulsified products because of their surface adsorption.<br>
Unique properties of the cationic emulsifiers enables the development of highly<br>
lipophilic system that offer enhanced consumer benefits like smooth powdery skin<br>
feel which non ionic and anionic emulsifiers do not.<br>
Development of formulations with cationic emulsifiers is straightforward and similar to the techniques employed with the traditional non-ionic emulsifiers. They can either be added to the water or oil phase. Similar to other hydrophilic 0/W emulsifiers, additional stabilization of the formulations is achieved by incorporating consistency enhancers such as stearyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol or glyceryl stearate.<br>
The skin care composition of the present invention includes at least one or more of salt of amido amine made in situ by reacting amido amines represented by the general formula hereunder with low molecular weight inorganic or organic acids<br>

R^ = C7 - C23 Aliphatic Hydrocarbon Radical<br>
R^ = Dialkylamino or Heterocyclic amino group<br>
n = 2, 3<br>
The component of the amido amine employed in the said skin care composition is of<br>
the general formula R* - C(0) - NH(CH2)n - R* - Examples of suitable amido<br>
amines include but are not limited to stearamidopropyl dimethylamine,<br>

 <br>
: the compounds based upon the alkanoic acid from which the amide is derived, e.g., stearamido is derived from the reaction of stearic acid and an organic amine)<br>
Preferred amines are allcyl amidopropyl dimethyl amines, which are commercially available under the trade names Mackine 301, Incromine SB, Lexamine S13, Tegamine S13, Mackine 501V, Mackine 1001, Mackine 1201, Mackine 601, Schercodine™ S etc. with Behenamidopropyl dimethyl amine {N-[3-(Dimethylamino) Propyl] docosanamide} being the most preferred one .<br>
The proportion of said higher alkyiamldo lower alkyl di-lower alkyl amine in the final composition is about 0.1% to 2%, preferably 0.50% to 1.5%, by weight.<br>
Low molecular weight acidic neutraliser:<br>
I The skin care composition of the present invention further includes the said R* C(0)-NH(CH2)n - R wherein R = C7 - C23 Aliphatic hydrocarbon radical, R = diaikyiamino or a heterocyclic amino group and n = 2, 3 alkyl amine compound in the form of an acid salt. Such salt is formed when the amine base is neutralized with a low molecular weight aliphatic and aromatic organic acid or inorganic acid and preferably selected from acids having groups such as -OH, -CI, -NH2, ~C=C- and having molecular wt. ranging from 36.4 to 200 to form the acidic cationic salt.
