is an engine unit including in flat view an engine and a belt<br>
type continuously variable transmission (a continuously<br>
variable transmission will be referred to as a "CVT",<br>
hereinafter).<br>
An engine unit is wide in width since a belt type CVT<br>
is located on the outer side of a piston of an engine in the<br>
vehicle width direction. This causes a footstep to greatly<br>
project in the vehicle width direction in a motorcycle to which<br>
the engine unit including the belt type CVT is mounted.<br>
Accordingly, there is a problem that a vehicle body is difficult<br>
to be downsized in width.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

downsize a vehicle body in width in a motorcycle to which an<br><br>
engine unit including a belt type CVT is mounted.<br>
A motorcycle in accordance with the invention includes:<br>
an engine unit; and a pair of right and left footsteps. The<br>
engine unit includes: an engine; a belt type continuously<br>
variable transmission; a clutch; and a rotation motor. The<br>
engine includes a crank shaft. The belt type continuously<br>
variable transmission includes a primary sheave, a secondary<br>
sheave shaft and a secondary sheave. The primary sheave is<br>
provided on one side of the crank shaft in a vehicle width<br>
direction. The secondary sheave shaft is provided behind the<br>
crank shaft. The secondary sheave is provided on the secondary<br>
sheave shaft. The clutch is provided on another side in the<br>
vehicle width direction with respect to the secondary sheave<br>
on the secondary sheave shaft. The rotation motor is provided<br>

a lower end of a secondary sheave 37, as shown in Fig. 4. This<br>
allows the pair of right and left footsteps 30 to be provided<br>
on a further inner side in the vehicle width direction.<br><br>
Reduction in vehicle width is thus achieved.<br>
The off-road type motorcycle 1 in accordance with the<br>
embodiment will be described in detail hereinafter, made<br>
reference to Fig. 1 and such. The motorcycle in accordance<br>
with the invention, however, is not limited to the above. In<br>
the invention, a motorcycle means a so-called motorcycle in<br>
the broad sense. That is to say, in the invention, a motorcycle<br>
not only means a so-called motorcycle in the narrow sense but<br>
also includes a motor scooter and a so-called moped, for<br>
example.<br>
Fig. 1 is a side view of a motorcycle 1 in accordance<br>
with the embodiment. Fig. 2 is a sectional view of a part<br>
of a center portion of the motorcycle 1 in right side view.<br>
First, described will be a schematic structure of the<br>
motorcycle 1, made reference to Figs . 1 and 2 . In the following<br>
description, a back-and-forth direction and a lateral<br>
direction mean directions in the view from a driver sitting<br>
on a seat 11.<br>
The motorcycle 1 has a body frame 2. The body frame 2<br>
includes a steering head pipe 3, down tube 4 and a seat pillar<br>
5. The down tube 4 extends downward from the steering head<br>
pipe 3. The seat pillar 5 extends to the rear side from the<br>
steering head pipe 3 above the down tube 4 . A supporting member<br>
31 is mounted to a top end of the seat pillar 5. The supporting<br><br>
member 31 extends to the front side from the top end of the<br>
seat pillar 5 . To a top end of the supporting member 31, mounted<br>
is a pair of right and left footsteps 30 on which feet 60 of<br>
a driver are put (refer to Fig. 5, too).<br>
Above the footstep 30, provided is a kick shaft 70, as<br>
shown in Fig. 2.<br>
A lower end of the steering head pipe 3 is connected to<br>
a front wheel 7 through a front fork 6 or the like. In the<br>
vicinity of a lower end of the seat pillar 5, pivotably<br>
supported is a rear arm 8 extending to the rear side. In detail,<br>
a base end of the rear arm 8 is pivotably supported on a pivot<br>
shaft 5a connected to the seat pillar 5. A top end (a rear<br>
end) of the rear ram 8 is connected to a rear wheel 9. Over<br>
the body frame 2, provided is a cover 10 for covering the body<br>
frame 2. A seat 11 is fitted on a somewhat rear side of the<br>
center of the cover 10.<br>
Between the down tube 4 and the seat pillar 5, provided<br>
is an engine unit 12 mounted to (suspended on) the down tube<br>
4 and the seat pillar 5. The engine unit 12 is formed from<br>
an engine 13, a CVT (a belt type continuously variable<br>
transmission) 14, a centrifugal clutch 15, a generator 29 and<br>
a reduction mechanism 16, which are integrated into one body.<br>
The driving force generated in the engine unit 12 is arranged<br>
to be transmitted to the rear wheel 9 through a power<br>
transmitting means (not shown) such as a chain belt.<br><br>
-Structure of Engine Unit 12-<br>
Now, a structure of the engine unit 12 will be described<br>
mainly with reference to Fig. 3. The engine unit 12 includes<br>
the engine 13, the belt type CVT 14, the centrifugal clutch<br>
15, the reduction mechanism 16 and the generator 29. For the<br>
sake of convenience, a partial structure of the reduction<br>
mechanism 16 is omitted from drawing in Fig. 3.<br>
(Unit Case 50)<br>
The engine unit 12 is housed in a unit case 50. The unit<br>
case 50 includes a crank case 51, a generator case 54 and a<br>
transmission case 55.<br>
In the crank case 51, housed is a crank shaft 20. The<br>
crank case 51 is formed from a first case block 52 and a second<br>
case block 53, which are faced to each other in the vehicle<br>
width direction. The first case block 52 is located on the<br>
left side of the piston 23. The second case block.53 is located<br>
on the right side of the piston 23.<br>
The transmission case 55 is mounted on the right side<br>
of the crank case 51 (concretely, the second case block 53).<br>
The transmission case 55 is formed from an inner case 56 and<br>
an outer case 57. The inner case 56 is mounted on the right<br>
side of the crank case 51 (concretely, the second case block<br>
53) . The outer case 57 is mounted on the right side of the<br>
inner case 56. A belt chamber 34 is formed into a section by<br>
means of the outer case 57 and the inner case 56.<br><br>
The generator case 54 is detachably mounted on the left<br>
side of a front half part of the first case block 52. The<br>
generator case 54 divides a space to form a generator chamber<br>
for housing the generator 29 together with the first case block<br>
52. The generator case 54 is provided at a position opposite<br>
to the primary sheave 36 in the vehicle width direction to form<br>
an expanded part of the unit case 50.<br>
The length L1 in the vehicle width direction from a center<br>
line of the engine 13 extending in the back-and-forth direction<br>
(namely, a center line of the engine 13 extending in the<br>
back-and-forth direction) C2 to an outer end 54a of the<br>
generator case 54 in the vehicle width direction is longer than<br>
the length L2 from the center line C2 of the engine 13 to an<br>
outer end 55a of a part of the transmission case 55 in the<br>
vehicle width direction, the part being for housing the primary<br>
sheave 36. That is to say, the generator case 54., which forms<br>
the expanded part, largely expands in the vehicle width<br>
direction more than the part of the transmission case 55 for<br>
housing the primary sheave 36.<br>
(Engine 13)<br>
The engine 13 includes a crank shaft 20 extending<br>
horizontally in the vehicle width direction, a substantially<br>
cylindrical cylinder 18 and a cylinder head 19. The crank<br>
shaft 20 is housed in the crank case 51. The crank shaft 20<br>
is supported on the first case block 52 and the second case<br><br>
block 53 through bearings 21 and 22.<br>
The cylinder 18 is connected obliquely upward in front<br>
of the crank case 51 (refer to Fig. 1, too) . The cylinder head<br>
19 is connected to a top end of the cylinder 18. The piston<br>
23 is slidably inserted into the cylinder 18. The piston 23<br>
is connected on a crank shaft 20 side thereof to one end of<br>
a connection rod 24. The other end of the connection rod 24<br>
is connected to a crank pin 17 provided between a left crank<br>
arm 20a and a right crank arm 20b of the crank shaft 20.<br>
Accordingly, the piston 23 reciprocates in the cylinder 18 in<br>
accordance with rotation of the crank shaft 20.<br>
In the cylinder head 19, formed are a concave part 19a<br>
connected to an inner space of the cylinder 18 and an intake<br>
port and an exhaust port (not shown) , which communicate to the<br>
concave part 19a. An ignition plug 25 is fixedly inserted in<br>
the cylinder head 19 so that an ignition part at a top end of<br>
the ignition plug 25 would be exposed in the concave part 19a.<br>
A cam chain chamber 2 6 for connecting an inner part of<br>
the crank case 51 and an inner part of the cylinder head 19<br>
is formed in a part on the left side of the cylinder 18. The<br>
cam chain chamber 26 is provided in its inside with a cam chain<br>
27. The cam chain 27 is wound around the crank shaft 20 and<br>
the cam shaft 28. This allows the cam shaft 28 to rotate in<br>
accordance with rotation of the crank shaft 20, so that an<br>
intake valve and an exhaust valve, which are not shown, are<br><br>
opened and closed.<br>
On the right side of a rear half part of the second case<br>
block 53, formed is an opening. The opening is closed by means<br>
of a clutch cover 32. The clutch cover 32 is detachably fixed<br>
to the second case block 53 by means of a bolt 33.<br>
(Generator 29)<br>
A left end of the crank shaft 20 passes through the first<br>
case block 52 to reach the inside of the generator case 54.<br>
The generator 29 is mounted to the left end of the crank shaft<br>
20. Concretely, the generator 29 includes a rotor 29a and a<br>
stator 29b. The rotor 29a is formed into the shape of a cylinder.<br>
The stator 29b is provided in the rotor 29a.<br>
The stator 29b is fixed to the generator case 54 so as<br>
not to rotate and not to be displaced. On the other hand, the<br>
rotor 29a is fixed to a sleeve 35 rotating together with the<br>
crank shaft 20. This allows the rotor 29a to rotate relatively<br>
to the stator 29b in accordance with rotation of the crank shaft<br>
20, so that the generation of electricity is carried out.<br>
In the belt chamber 34, housed is a belt type CVT 14.<br>
The belt type CVT 14 includes the primary sheave 3 6 and the<br>
secondary sheave 37. The secondary sheave 37 is provided<br>
behind the primary sheave 36.<br>
(Belt Type CVT 14)<br>
The crank shaft 20 passes through the second case block<br>
53 and the inner case 56 to extend to the belt chamber 34. A<br><br>
right side part of the crank shaft 20 having reached the belt<br>
chamber 34 (strictly, a part on the right side of the bearing<br>
22) forms a primary sheave shaft 20c. The primary sheave 36<br>
is mounted to the primary sheave shaft 20c. Accordingly, the<br>
primary sheave 36 rotates together with the crank shaft 20.<br>
Concretely, the primary sheave 36 includes a primary<br>
fixing sheave body 36a, a primary movable sheave body 36b, a<br>
roller weight 44 and a cam plate 43. The primary fixing sheave<br>
body 36a is fixed to a right top end of the primary sheave shaft<br>
20c. The primary movable sheave body 36b is mounted to the<br>
primary sheave shaft 20c on the left side of the primary fixing<br>
sheave body 36a. The primary movable sheave body 36b is<br>
movable in an axial direction with respect to the primary sheave<br>
shaft 20c. The primary fixing sheave body 36a and the primary<br>
movable sheave body 36b form a belt groove 36c capable of<br>
varying its width.<br>
On the further left side of the primary movable sheave<br>
body 36, provided is a cam plate 43. The cam plate 43 is fixed<br>
to the primary sheave shaft 20c. A space between the primary<br>
movable sheave body 36b and the cam plate 43 is narrowed toward<br>
the outer side in the diameter direction. The roller weight<br>
44 is provided between the primary movable sheave body 36b and<br>
the cam plate 43. The roller weight 44 is provided so that<br>
it can be displaced inward or outward in the diameter direction.<br>
On the other hand, a rear half of the transmission case<br><br>
55 is provided with a secondary sheave shaft 38. The secondary<br>
sheave shaft 38 is provided substantially parallel to the<br>
primary sheave shaft 20c. The secondary sheave shaft 38 passes<br>
through the inner case 56 and the crutch cover 32 to extend<br>
to the inside of the crank case 51. The secondary sheave shaft<br>
38 is mounted to the clutch cover 32 through a bearing 39. The<br>
secondary sheave 37 is mounted to the secondary sheave shaft<br>
38 in the belt chamber 34.<br>
Concretely, the secondary sheave 37 includes a secondary<br>
fixing sheave body 37a and a secondary movable sheave body 37b.<br>
The secondary fixing sheave body 37a is fixed to the secondary<br>
sheave shaft 38 in the belt chamber 34. The secondary movable<br>
sheave body 37b is mounted to the secondary sheave shaft 38<br>
on the right side of the secondary fixing sheave body 37a. The<br>
secondary movable sheave body 37b is movable in an axial<br>
direction with respect to the secondary sheave shaft 38. The<br>
secondary fixing sheave body 37a and the secondary movable<br>
sheave body 37b form a belt groove 37c capable of varying its<br>
width.<br>
To a right top end of the secondary sheave shaft 38, fixed<br>
is a spring stopper 47. A compression coil spring 45 is<br>
provided between the spring stopper 47 and the secondary<br>
movable sheave body 37b. Urging force of the compression coil<br>
spring 45 causes the secondary movable sheave body 37b to be<br>
urged leftward, that is, toward the secondary fixing sheave<br><br>
body 37a.<br>
A V belt (a resin block V belt, for example) 41 is wound<br>
around the belt groove 37c of the secondary sheave 37 and the<br>
belt groove 36c of the primary sheave 36. Accordingly, when<br>
the primary sheave 36 rotates together with the crank shaft<br>
20, torque thereof is transmitted to the secondary sheave 37<br>
through the V belt 41. This results in rotation of the<br>
secondary sheave shaft 38 together with the secondary sheave<br>
37.<br>
A centrifugal clutch 15 is mounted to a part of the<br>
secondary sheave shaft 38 on the left side of the clutch cover<br>
32. The centrifugal clutch 15 is further connected to the<br>
reduction mechanism 16. The centrifugal clutch 15 connects<br>
and disconnects the secondary sheave shaft 38 and the reduction<br>
mechanism 16 in accordance with the rotation speed of the<br>
secondary sheave shaft 38.<br>
(Centrifugal Clutch 15)<br>
The centrifugal clutch 15 includes a clutch boss 15a<br>
connected to the reduction mechanism 16, a substantially<br>
cylindrical clutch housing 15b and a roller weight 15c. The<br>
roller weight 15c is provided so that it can be displaced inward<br>
and outward in the diameter direction. The clutch housing 15b<br>
is fixed to the secondary sheave shaft 38. Accordingly, the<br>
clutch housing 15b rotates together with the secondary sheave<br>
shaft 38 . The clutch housing 15b includes plural clutch plates<br><br>
15d provided at substantially even intervals therebetween. An<br>
interval of the clutch plates 15d adjacent to each other is<br>
arranged to be variable.<br>
The clutch boss 15a is provided in the clutch housing<br>
15b. The clutch boss 15a is rotatable with respect to the<br>
secondary sheave shaft 38 . The clutch boss 15a includes plural<br>
friction plates 15e provided at substantially even intervals<br>
therebetween. An interval of the friction plates 15e adjacent<br>
to each other is arranged to be variable.<br>
The clutch plate 15d and the friction plate 15e are<br>
separated from each other and the clutch housing 15b is not<br>
connected to the clutch boss 15a when the secondary sheave shaft<br>
38 is slow in its rotational speed. Accordingly, torque of<br>
the secondary sheave shaft 38 is not transmitted to the<br>
reduction mechanism 16.<br>
On the other hand, when the rotational speed of the<br>
secondary sheave shaft 38 is fast, the roller weight 15c is<br>
displaced outward in the diameter direction. This narrows a<br>
distance between the adjacent friction plates 15e. The clutch<br>
plates 15d and the friction plates 15e are then respectively<br>
contacted by pressure. As a result, the clutch housing 15b<br>
is connected to the clutch boss 15a, so that the torque of the<br>
secondary sheave shaft 38 is transmitted to the reduction<br>
mechanism 16.<br>
The torque transmitted to the reduction mechanism 16 is<br><br><br>
outputted from an output shaft 16a (not shown in Fig. 3; refer<br>
to Fig. 5) of the reduction mechanism 16 to be transmitted to<br>
the rear wheel 9. The output shaft 16a is provided behind the<br>
expanded generator case 54, as shown in Fig. 5. The output<br>
shaft 16a is provided in the crank case 51. A left part of<br>
the output shaft 16a passes through the crank case 51 to extend<br>
to the outside of the crank case 51. A power transmission means<br>
such as a chain is wound around the left side part of the output<br>
shaft 16a.<br>
-Arrangement of Respective Structural Members of Motorcycle<br>
1-<br>
Now, described will be arrangement of respective<br>
structural members of the motorcycle 1, made reference to Figs.<br>
1 to 5.<br>
(Arrangement of Engine Unit)<br>
In-the embodiment, the engine unit 12 is provided so that<br>
the center line C2 of the piston 23 extending in the<br>
back-and-forth direction would be located on the left side of<br>
a center line C1 of the steering head pipe 3 extending in the<br>
back-and-forth direction in the vehicle width direction in<br>
flat view, as shown in Fig. 5. In other words, the engine unit<br>
12 is provided so that the center line C2 of the engine 13 would<br>
be located on the left side of the center line C1 of the body<br>
frame 2 extending in the back-and-forth direction in the<br>
vehicle width direction in flat view. That is to say, the<br><br>
engine unit 12 is offset to the left side opposite to a side<br>
on which the belt type CVT 14 is provided.<br>
(Arrangement of Primary Sheave 36 and Secondary Sheave 37)<br>
On the other hand, in flat view, the belt type CVT 14<br>
is provided so as to extend upward to the rear side, as shown<br>
in Fig. 4 and such. Concretely, the center axis of rotation<br>
A1 of the secondary sheave shaft 38 is located at a position<br>
higher than the center axis of rotation A2 of the crank shaft<br>
20.<br>
(Arrangement of Footstep 30)<br>
As shown in Fig. 5, the footstep 30 is provided so that<br>
at least a part thereof would be located behind a rear end 29c<br>
of the generator 29. Further, at least a part of the footstep<br>
30 is located in front of the rear end 37e of the secondary<br>
sheave 37 and behind the front end 37f of the same. Concretely,<br>
at least a part- of the. footstep 30 is located in a part where<br>
a left side behind the generator case 54 is concave. The output<br>
shaft 16a is similarly provided in the part where a left side<br>
behind the generator case 54 is concave.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, at least a part of the footstep 30<br>
is located under a lower end 37d of the secondary sheave 37<br>
in a perpendicular direction. The footstep 30 is provided so<br>
that an upper end 30a thereof would be located above a lower<br>
end 12a of the engine unit 12.<br>
(Arrangement of Pivot Shaft 5a)<br><br>
The pivot shaft 5a is provided above at least a part of<br>
the footstep 30 and under the center axis of rotation A1 of<br>
the secondary sheave shaft 38. Concretely, the pivot shaft<br>
5a is provided at a height substantially equal to that of the<br>
center axis of rotation A2 of the crank shaft 20.<br>&gt;<br>
Taking account of a fact that the engine unit 12 vibrates<br>
in running of the motorcycle 1, a comparatively large clearance<br>
should be provided between the engine unit 12 and the footstep<br>
30 for the purpose of preventing a collision between the engine<br>
unit 12 and the footstep 30. Accordingly, the footstep 30<br>
should be provided on a side more outer in the vehicle width<br>
direction in order to separate the footstep 30 from an expanded<br>
part 55b expanding outward in the vehicle width direction<br>
(refer to Figs. 1 and 2) in the case that the expanded part<br>
55b is overlapped with the footstep 30 in the vehicle width<br>
direction, for example.<br>
In the embodiment, however, the center axis of rotation<br>
Al of the secondary sheave shaft 38 is provided at a position<br>
higher than the center axis of rotation A2 of the crank shaft<br>
20 while at least a part of the footstep 30 is arranged to be<br>
located behind the rear end 29c of the generator 29 and under<br>
the lower end 37d of the secondary sheave 37, as described above.<br>
Accordingly, overlap in the vehicle width direction between<br>
the expanded part 55b expanded outward in the vehicle width<br><br>
direction and the footstep 30 is prevented, as shown in Fig.<br>
4. This allows the footstep 30 to be located on a side more<br>
inner in the vehicle width direction. As a result, the vehicle<br>
width of the motorcycle 1 can be reduced.<br>
The footstep 30, as a whole, is preferably arranged to<br>
be provided behind the rear end 29c of the generator 29 and<br>
under the lower end 37d of the secondary sheave 37. This allows<br>
the vehicle width of the motorcycle 1 to be reduced.<br>
The above effect is large when at least a part of the<br>
footstep 30 is located in front of the rear end 37e of the<br>
secondary sheave 37 and behind the front end 37f of the<br>
secondary sheave 37 like the embodiment. Further, the effect<br>
is particularly large when the whole footstep 30 is provided<br>
in front of the rear end 37e of the secondary sheave 37 and<br>
behind the front end 37f of the secondary sheave 37.<br>
Moreover, as in- the embodiment, it may be. possible to<br>
provide the center axis of rotation A1 of the secondary sheave<br>
shaft 38 at a position higher than the center axis of rotation<br>
A2 of the crank shaft 20 to provide the engine unit 12 so that<br>
the rear side thereof would be higher than the front side<br>
thereof in order to shorten the length of the engine unit 12<br>
in the back-and-forth direction. This allows the seat pillar<br>
5 to be provided on the further front side. As a result, the<br>
pivot shaft 5a can be also provided on the further front side,<br>
so that the rear arm 8 can be made long. Accordingly,<br><br>
performance of motion of the motorcycle 1 can be improved.<br>
Furthermore, the pivot shaft 5a is located above at least<br>
a part of the footstep 30 and under the center axis of rotation<br>
A1 of the secondary sheave shaft 38 in the embodiment.<br>
Accordingly, the footstep 30 is separated more from the center<br>
axis of rotation Al of the secondary sheave shaft 38. This<br>
allows interference of the footstep 30 with the engine unit<br>
12 in the vehicle width direction to be reduced more.<br>
Accordingly, the footstep 30 can be provided on a side more<br>
inner of the vehicle width direction. This results in<br>
effective reduction in vehicle width of the motorcycle 1.<br>
The pivot shaft 5a is preferably provided above an upper<br>
end of the footstep 30 and under the center axis of rotation<br>
Al of the secondary sheave shaft 38. This allows the vehicle<br>
width of the motorcycle 1 to be especially effectively reduced.<br>
Further, providing the center axis of rotation Al of the<br>
secondary sheave shaft 38 comparatively upward as described<br>
above allows interference of an ankle of a foot 60, which is<br>
comparatively projecting, with the expanded part 55b to be<br>
prevented. Accordingly, the footstep 30 can be provided in<br>
a side more inner in the vehicle width direction, so that the<br>
vehicle width of the motorcycle 1 can be further effectively<br>
reduced.<br>
In addition, interference of the unit case 50 with the<br>
pivot shaft 5a can be prevented since the pivot shaft 5a is<br><br>
provided above at least a part of the footstep 30 and under<br>
the center axis of rotation A1 of the secondary sheave shaft<br>
38 . This allows the pivot shaft 5a to be provided on the further<br>
front side. Accordingly, performance of motion of the<br>
motorcycle 1 can be more improved. Even from this point of<br>
view, the pivot shaft 5a is particularly preferable to be<br>
provided above the upper end of the footstep 30 and under the<br>
center axis of rotation Al of the secondary sheave shaft 38.<br>
In the embodiment, the footstep 30 is provided so that<br>
the upper end 30a thereof would be located above the lower end<br>
12a of the engine unit 12, as shown in Fig. 4. Accordingly,<br>
the footstep 30 does not project downward largely from the lower<br>
end 12a of the engine unit 12 . This allows the vehicle height<br>
of the motorcycle 1 to be comparatively low.<br>
In the embodiment, an expanded part (the generator case<br>
54 in the embodiment) is provided in the front half of the unit<br>
case 50 on a side (the left side) opposite to a side (the right<br>
side) on which the belt type CVT 14 is provided in the vehicle<br>
width direction (refer to Fig. 5). Furthermore, the engine<br>
unit 12 is offset toward the left. Moreover, the footstep 30<br>
is provided behind the expanded part. Accordingly, the<br>
vehicle width of the motorcycle 1 can be further reduced.<br>
Providing the expanded part in the front half of the unit<br>
case 50 on a side (the left side) opposite to a side on which<br>
the belt type CVT 14 is provided in the vehicle width direction<br><br>
causes a space to be made in a rear half of the unit case 50<br>
on the left side. This allows the width of the rear half of<br>
the unit case 50 to be narrowed.<br>
Both of the front and rear halves of the engine unit 12<br>
on the right side, however, largely project from the center<br>
line C2 of the engine 13. Accordingly, the footstep 30 should<br>
be provided so as to be separated from the center line C1 of<br>
 the vehicle body in the case that the engine unit 12 is provided<br>
so that the center line C2 of the engine 13 would be accorded<br>
with the center line C1 of the vehicle body as before. The<br>
vehicle width of the motorcycle 1 thus cannot be sufficiently<br>
narrowed.<br>
Narrowing the width of the rear half of the unit case<br>
50 on the left side and offsetting the engine unit 12 leftward<br>
allow the left and right parts of the engine unit 12 to be<br>
prevented from expanding. As a result, the footstep. .30<br>
provided behind the expanded part can be located more closely<br>
to the center line C1 of the vehicle body. This allows the<br>
vehicle width of the motorcycle 1 to be prevented form<br>
increasing.<br>
In front of the footstep 30, provided is the generator<br>
case 54 projecting in the vehicle width direction. Further,<br>
in front of the footstep 30, located is a comparatively expanded<br>
part for housing the primary sheave 36 of the transmission case<br>
55. A driver, however, puts his foot 60 on the footstep 30<br><br>
so that a toe side would widen, as shown in Fig. 5 . Accordingly,<br>
it is not a major matter to have an expanded part in front of<br>
the footstep 30. Therefore, the footstep 30 may be arranged<br>
so that the inner end of the footstep 30 would be provided on<br>
the inner side of the outer end 54a of the generator case 54<br>
in the vehicle width direction. The footstep 30 may be<br>
arranged so that the inner end of the footstep 30 would be<br>
provided on the inner side of the outer end 55a of the<br>
transmission case 55 in the vehicle width direction.<br>
That is to say, providing a comparatively large<br>
structural member in a somewhat front side part of the unit<br>
case 50 and narrowing the width of a rear side on which the<br>
footstep 30 is provided in the back-and-forth direction of the<br>
unit case 50 as in the embodiment allow effectively the footstep<br>
30 to be provided more closely to the center line C1 of the<br>
vehicle body. This results in a narrower vehicle width of the<br>
motorcycle 1. Moreover, from this point of view, the cam chain<br>
27 is preferably wound on the left side of the crank shaft 20.<br>
«0ther Modifications»<br>
In the embodiment, described is an example that the<br>
generator 29 is provided on the left side of the crank shaft<br>
20 in the vehicle width direction. The invention, however,<br>
is not limited to the structure. An electric motor may be<br>
provided instead of the generator 29, for example. That is<br>
to say, it may be possible to provide a rotation motor having<br><br>
both of a function as a generator and a function as an electric<br>
motor.<br>
In the embodiment, described is an example in which a<br>
bar-shaped body extending in the vehicle width direction forms<br>
the footstep 30. The footstep 30, however, may be in the shape<br>
of a plate, for example. That is to say, the footstep 30 may<br>
be in the shape having a flat surface part on which the foot<br>
60 is put.<br>
The invention is useful for a motorcycle, particularly,<br>
an off-road type motorcycle.<br><br>
