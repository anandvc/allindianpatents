[0016]<br>
Fig. 2 is side view explaining structure of periphery of the housing box according to the present invention, and shows a state in which the housing box 14, the fuel tank 15 and the rear fender 17 have been mounted onto the vehicle body frame 11.<br>
The vehicle body frame 11 is composed of: a front inclined portion 35 extending obliquely below backward from the head pipe 21; a horizontal portion 36 extending substantially horizontally further afterward from this front inclined portion 35; a rising portion 37 rising upwardly afterward from this horizontal portion 36; and a rear horizontal portion 38 extending substantially horizontally afterward from this rising portion 37, and is constructed with one main pipe 41 for part of the way to the front inclined portion 35 from the head pipe 21 and with a pair of rear pipes 42 up to the rear horizontal portion 38 from halfway of the front inclined portion 35. [0017]<br>
The horizontal portion 36 is in the lower part provided<br><br>
with a pivot plate 43 for supporting the engine 12 (See Fig. 1) and the rear folk 32 (See Fig. 1) . In this respect, a reference numeral 43a designates a rear folk pivot shaft installation hole bored in the pivot plate 43 in order to mount the pivot shaft 33 (See Fig. 1) for swingably supporting the rear folk 32. [0018]<br>
Also, in the vehicle body frame 11, in order to mount the housing box 14, a front bracket 44 is fixed to the front inclined portion 35, and a mounting plate 45 is fixed to the horizontal portion 36; in order to mount the housing box 14 and the fuel tank 15, a rear bracket 46 is fixed to the upper part of the rising portion 37; in order to mount the fuel tank 15, a rear mounting portion 47 is provided. In this respect, a reference numeral 48 designates a flange of the fuel tank 15, and this flange 48 is mounted to the vehicle body frame 11. [0019]<br>
The housing box 14 is arranged above the horizontal portion 36 and the rising portion 37 of the vehicle body frame 11, and the fuel tank 15 is arranged behind the housing box 14 and above the rear horizontal portion 38. [0020]<br>

[0021]<br>
In this manner, an interval Bl between the front inclined portion 35 and the horizontal portion 36 has been made narrower, and an interval B2 between the rear horizontal portions 38 has been made broader. This is because by making the interval Bl narrower, a feeling of slimness of the vehicle body is acquired and the ease of egress and ingress is improved, and by making the interval B2 broader, it is made possible to mount a broad fuel tank 15 with stability. [0022]<br>
A rising portion 37 for connecting between the above described intervals Bl and B2 has rear pipes 42, 42 rising three-dimensionally and space between the rising portions 37 becomes an unstable shape, and therefore, it has been effectively utilized by exerting ingenuity as described later. [0023]<br>
The housing box 14 has, in the rear part thereof, a battery housing portion 52 for housing the battery 51, and the battery housing portion 52 is space obtained by completely isolating the battery 51 from a small article housing portion 54 for housing a helmet and other small articles by forming a partition<br><br>

Next, the description will be made of an operation of the housing box structure described above.<br>
In Fig. 4, for example, in the case where rainwater splashed from the rear wheel side has flown above the rear fender 17 as indicated by an arrow 2, such rainwater flown can be interrupted by the shield wall 65 below the battery housing portion 52 to prevent rainwater from scattering as indicated by an arrow 3. Thereby, it is possible to prevent rainwater from entering the housing box 14 through the lid supporting holes 96, 96 shown in Fig. 5.<br>
Also, in Fig. 4, with the provision of the stand-up wall 67 of the rear fender 17, it is possible to more effectively prevent rainwater from splashing over the lid supporting holes 96, 96 (See Fig. 5) by means of the labyrinth structure formed by this stand-up wall 67 and the shield wall 65. [0045]<br><br>
As explained in Figs. 4 and 5 described above, the present invention is fifthly characterized in that in the rear part of the housing box 14, there is provided a rear fender 17 for covering the upper part of a rear wheel 16 (See Fig. 1), the rear fender 17 is provided with a stand-up wall 67, and the stand-up wall 67 and the shield wall 65 form labyrinth structure.<br>
Rainwater or the like splashed from the rear wheel 16 side can be more reliably prevented from scattering over the lid supporting hole 96 by means of the labyrinth structure, and there is no fear of entry of rainwater or the like into the housing box 14. [0046]<br>
In this respect, the shield wall and the stand-up wall according to the present invention can be formed in plurality respectively and be alternately arranged to form the labyrinth structure. [0047] [Effect of the Invention]<br>
The present invention exhibits the following effect because of the above described structure.<br>
According to the structure of a housing box for a motorcycle of the Claim 1, in the case of such a motorcycle as a business bike having larger tire diameter than the scooter type, with the provision of the battery housing portion for housing the battery in the rear part of the housing box, space around the fuel tank in the rear part of the vehicle body is not occupied by the battery, but the fuel tank can be extended<br><br>
in front and in rear, and left and right to secure the tank capacity. Also, since the battery is housed in the rear part of the housing box, the battery can be easily maintained, for example, by opening the seat, which serves as a lid of the housing box so that maintainability of the battery can be improved. [0048]<br>
According to the structure of a housing box for a motorcycle of the Claim 2, the vehicle body frame is constructed such that a left-right interval of the horizontal portion is made narrower and a left-right interval of a rising portion continuing to this horizontal portion is gradually made broader, whereby a left-right interval of the rear inclined portion is made broader than the interval of the horizontal portion, and between the left and right rising portions, there is provided the battery housing portion. Therefore, space between the rising portions, which rise backward from the horizontal portion, and the left-right interval of which varies, can be effectively utilized. [0049]<br>
According to the structure of a housing box for a motorcycle of the Claim 3, at a side position of the battery housing portion, the housing box is provided with an installation seat, and this installation seat is coupled to the vehicle body frame, and therefore, in space between the rising portions of the vehicle body frame, there can be provided a mounting portion for mounting the housing box, and the above described space can be utilized more effectively.<br><br>
[0050]<br>
According to the structure of a housing box for a motorcycle of the Claim 4, a lid for covering a battery housed in the battery housing portion is mounted onto the housing box so as to be able to.be opened and closed, a hole portion, which serves as a fulcrum of opening and closing of this lid, is provided on a wall around the battery housing portion, and a shield wall for preventing rainwater or the like from scattering over this hole portion is caused to project from the housing box, and therefore, it is possible to prevent rainwater or the like from scattering over the hole portion, and to make it difficult to cause rainwater or the like to enter the housing box. [0051]<br>
According to the structure of a housing box for a motorcycle of the Claim 5, in the rear part of the housing box, there is provided a rear fender for covering the upper part of a rear wheel, the rear fender is provided with a stand-up wall, and the stand-up wall and the shield wall form labyrinth structure. Therefore, rainwater or the like splashed from the rear wheel side can be more reliably prevented from scattering over the hole portion by means of the labyrinth structure, and there is no fear of entry of rainwater or the like into the housing box.<br><br><br>
