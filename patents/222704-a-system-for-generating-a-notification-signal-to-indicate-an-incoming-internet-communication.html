				<td>The invention relates to a system for generating a notification signal to indicate an incoming Internet communication.<br>
Real-time communication using voice, video and data between two or more parties using the Internet are becoming more and more popular due to the reduced cost of connection compared with conventional telephone communication.<br>
However, real-time communication over the Internet is only possible between two parties when both parties are connected to the Internet, This is because the web site which establishes the communication link requires the called party as well as the calling party to be the connected to the internet in order to alert the called party of an incoming communication through the called party's terminal, which will normally be some form of computer. It Is not possible for the web site to alert the called party, and therefore, establish the communication link, if the called party is not connected to the Internet.<br>
Hence, this is a limitation of using the Internet for real-time communication.<br>
In order to try and mitigate this problem some Internet service providers (ISPs) offer a service whereby an incoming real-time Internet voice communication is diverted to the telephone of the called party. The called party then uses their telephone to communicate with the calling party as is the communication is a conventional telephone call. This has the disadvantage of limiting the communication to voice communication.<br>
Alternatively, the calling party can make a telephone call to the called party to verbally request the called party to log on to the Internet to enable the communication link to be established. However, this has the disadvantage of still requiring the calling party to make a conventional telephone call.<br><br>
In accordance with a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a system for generating a notification signal to indicate an incoming Internet communication,  the system comprising a central communication processing device, a number of local    communication processing devices, and a communication notification device located with the called party and coupled to a telephone line associated with a called party, the central communication processing device, in response to a communication request from a calling party, determining the local communication processing device closest to the called party and instructing the closest local communication device to send a signal on the telephone line associated with the called party, the communication notification device, in response to the signal, confirming the identity of the called party with the local communication processing device, and subsequently generating a notification signal.<br>
In accordance with a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of establishing an Internet communication link, the method comprising a calling party establishing an Internet connection with a central communication processing device, providing identification information of a called party to the central<br>
, communication processing device, the central communication processing device sending the identification information of the called party to a local communication processing device in the vicinity of the called party, the local communication processing device sending a signal on a telephone line associated with the called party, the signal being detected by a communication notification device coupled to the telephone line, and in response to the signal, the communication notification device<br>
  confirming the identity of the called party with the local communication processing device and generating a notification signal, the called party establishing an Internet connection with the central communication processing device to establish an Internet communication link with the calling party.<br>
  An advantage of the invention is that it enables a called party to be notified of an incoming internet communication without requiring the called party to be connected to the internet in order to effect the notification, in addition the invention has the<br><br>
advantage of not requiring the called party to be contacted directly be the calling part^ in advance of the communication.<br>
Preferabiy, the closest local communication processing device is in a geographical location having the same telephone area code as the telephone line associated with the called party. This has the advantage of enabling the closest local communication processing device to send the signal on the telephone line associated with the called party while minimising the cost of sending the signal.<br>
Typically, when the communication notification device receives the signal, the communication notification device then establishes a communication link with the local communication processing device to confirm the identity of the called party. Preferably, the confirmation of identity is performed using a unique identity code which is associated with the called party and which is stored in the communication notification device. The unique identity code may be transmitted to the local communication processing device in an unencrypted format or an encrypted format.<br>
Preferably, the signal sent by the closest local communication processing device to<br>
the communication notification device is a telephone ring signal which may be<br>
 generated by the closest local communication processing device calling the telephone<br>
line associated with the called party. Typically, the signal comprises a limited number<br>
of telephone rings and is preferably, one ring. The signal type may comprise a<br>
ringing current signal, a dual the multiple frequency (DTMF) signal, a voltage line<br>
reversal signal or a frequency shift keying (FSK) signal.	<br><br>
Preferably, the communication link is established by the communication notification device calling the local communication processing device using the telephone line after the signal has been received.<br>
Typically, the communication notification device may comprises a visual and/or audio signaling device that generates the notification signal. Hence, the notification signal may be an audio signal, visual signal or a combination of audio and visual signals.<br><br>
Preferably, the central communication processing device comprises an Internet server and a calling party imerfaces with the server by means of a web page hosted on the server.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a system for generating a notification signal to indicate an incoming Internet communication, the system comprising a central communication processing device, a number of local communication processing devices, and a communication notification device coupled to a telephone line associated with a called party, the central communication processing device, in response to a communication request from a calling party, determining the local communication processing device closest to the called party and instructing the closest local communication device to send a signal on the telephone line associated with the called party, the communication notification device, in response to the signal, confirming the identity of the called party with the local communication processing device, and subsequently generating a notification signal.<br>

Figure 9 is a flow chart showing the internal operation of the call notification<br>
apparatus.<br><br>
Figure 1 is a schematic diagram illustrating a system for generating a notification signal of an incoming internet communication.   The system comprises a number of users 1, 2, 3, 4. Each user 1, 2, 3, 4 has a personal computer (PC) 51, 52, 53. 54 which is coupled to a telephone line 21, 22. 23, 24 via a modem {not shown). Also coupled to each telephone line 21.22, 23. 24 is a call notification apparatus 80, 660, 670, 680 and a telephone 31. 32, 33, 34. However, if the user 1, 2. 3, 4 has two or more telephone lines the call notification apparatus 80, 660, 670, 680 and the telephone 31, 32, 33, 34 may be coupled to a separate telephone line from the PC 51, 52, 53, 54.  Forth© purposes of this example, users 1 and 4 are located in country B and users 2 and 3 are located in country A. User 1 is located in telephone area code B2 of country B, user 4 is located in telephone area code B1 of country B. user 2 is located in telephone area code A2 of country A and user 3 is located in telephone area code A1 of country A.<br>
The operation of the apparatus 80 is based on the fact that normal telephone calls will ring a number of times before they are answered or the calling party terminates the call but calls initiated by the local call manager will only ring once. This permits the apparatus 80 to distinguish normal telephone calls from calls initiated by the local call manager. In addition, each apparatus 80, 660, 670, 680 is pre-programmed with the ) telephone number of the respective local call manager 60, 600, 30, 640, and has a pre-programmed serial number which is unique to each apparatus 30, 660, 670, 680.<br>
Figure 3 is a block diagram of the call notification apparatus 80 showing the important components. The other call notification apparatus 660. 670, 680 are identical except that the unique serial number is different. The apparatus 80 is connected to the telephone line 21 at connection point 61. For example, this may be a RJ-11 modular telephone jack common to most telephone sets. An additional RJ-11 connection at point 62 is made available for connection to the telephone 31. The apparatus 80 includes a microcontroller 88 with embedded firmware stored in its ROM location. The microcontroller 88 is connected to a ring detector 81, a FSK decoder 82, a DTMF decoder 83, a voltage line reversal detector 98, a DTMF transmitter 85, a de-activate<br><br>
button 86, light control circuitry 87, sound control circuitry 89, a voltage regulator circuitry 91 and a memory 92.<br>
The control circuits 87, 89 are standard control circuits and typically comprise a combination of transistors and resistors.<br>
The de-activate button 86, which is connected directly to the microcontroller 88. is provided to enable the user to physically de-activate the buzzer 93 and light 96. The apparatus can be powered by batteries and/or an external DC power adapter regulated by an internal voltage regulator IC. A low drop out voltage regulator IC is desirable for this purpose, such as a Holtel
Preferably, the microcontroller 88 Is provided a Novatek NT93422 integrated microcontroller. This has the advantage of integrating the FSK decoder 82 and the DTMF decoder 83 into the microcontroller 88.<br>
The DTMF transmitter 85 transmits DTMF signals onto the TIP and RING leads at point 61 which are connected to the local telephone exchanges. The DTMF signals transmitted from the analog output of transmitter 85 is controlled by the microcontroller 88, and is used for interacting with the telephone exchange system protocols. The microcontroller 88 also controls the transmission of the serial number through the DTMF transmitter 85. The local call manager's telephone number and the serial number unique to the apparatus 80 are stored in the memory 92. Alternatively, these numbers can also be pre-programmed into the firmware of the microcontroller 88.<br>
Four possible types of triggering signal can be used to trigger the apparatus 80. The four types of signal are: a ringing current signal; a voltage line reversal signal; a DTMF signal; and a FSK signal.<br>
Figures 5,6, 7 and 8 illustrate the four different types of triggering signal. However, only a triggering signal involving the ringing current generated via the PSTN initiated<br><br>
by the calling party as illustrated in Figure 5 does not required the collaboration of the local telephone operators. Other triggering signals, such as implementing a voltage line reversal signal by the local telephone operator as illustrated in Figure 6; sending a DTMF signal by the local telephone operator as illustrated in Figure 7; and sending a FSK signal by the local telephone operator as illustrated in Figure 8, require the collaboration of the local telephone operators.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates triggering the apparatus 80 by ringing current. The local call manager 60 initiates a telephone call to the telephone line 21 via the PSTN 10 as in process 112. The local call manager 60 uses a tone progress detector to check for the first ringing tone. If the first ringing tone is detected as in process 116, the call is terminated in process 118. At the same moment, the apparatus 80 detects the ringing signal on the line 21 as in process 117. The apparatus 80 continues to monitor subsequent ringing signals. In process 119, the apparatus 80 determines that there are no subsequent ringing signals and that the ringing signal is from the local call manager 60. It then initiates a telephone call to the local call manager 60 by using the telephone number residing in its memory 92 as in process 121. In process 122, the local call manager 60 accepted the incoming call. In process 125, the called party's apparatus 80 sends the serial number residing In its memory 92 to the local call manager 60. The local call manager 60 authenticates the received serial number in process 128. In process 132. the local call manager 60 sends the alert signal to the called party's apparatus 80. Upon receiving the alert signal, the called party's apparatus 80 terminates the call.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates the notification by voltage line reversal signal initiated by the local telephone exchange office 10. For this form of triggering, collaborations with the local telephone operators are essential. The local telephone exchange office 10 initiates voltage line reversal to the called party telephone line 21 via the PSTN as in process 170. At the same moment, the called party's apparatus 80 detected the voltage line reversal in process 172. The called party's apparatus 80 continues to monitor subsequent ringing signals. In process 119, the called party's apparatus 80 decided that there are no subsequent ringing signals and determined that the trigger signal is<br><br>
from the local call manager 60, (t then initiates a telephone call to the local call manager 60 by using the telephone number residing in its memory 92 as in process 121. In process 122, the local call manager 60 accepted the incoming call. In process 125, the called party's apparatus 80 sends the serial number residing in its memory 92 to the local call manager 60. The local call manager 60 authenticates the received serial number in process 128. In process 132, the local call manager 60 sends the alert signal to the called party's apparatus 80. Upon receiving the alert signal, the called party's apparatus 80 terminates the call.<br>
Figure 7 illustrates the notification by a DTMF signal initiated by the local telephone exchange office 10. For this form of triggering, collaborations with the local telephone operators are essential. The local telephone exchange office 10 initiates a DTMF signal to the called party telephone line 21 via the PSTN as in process 180. At the same moment, the called party's apparatus 80 detected the DTMF signal in process 182. The apparatus 80 continues to monitor subsequent ringing signals. In process 119, the apparatus 80 decided that there are no subsequent ringing signals and determined that the trigger signal is from the local call manager 60. It then initiates a telephone call to the local call manager 60 by using the telephone number residing in its memory 92 as in process 121. In process 122. the focal call manager 60 accepted the incoming call. In process 125, the apparatus 80 sends the serial number residing in its memory 92 to the local call manager 60. The local call manager 60 authenticates the received serial number in process 128. In process 132, the local call manager 60 sends the alert signal to the apparatus 80. Upon receiving the alert signal, the apparatus 80 terminates the call.<br>
Figure 8 illustrates the notification by a FSK signal initiated by the local telephone exchange office 10, For this form of triggering, collaborations with the local telephone operators are essential. The local telephone exchange office 10 sends the FSK signal to the telephone line 21 via the PSTN as in process 190. At the same moment, the apparatus 80 detected the FSK signal in process 192. The apparatus 80 continues to monitor subsequent ringing signals. In process 119, the apparatus 80 decided that there are no subsequent ringing signals and determined that the trigger signal is from<br><br>
the local call manager 60. It then initiates a telephone call to the local call manager 60 by using the telephone number residing in its memory 92 as in process 121. In process 122, the local call manager 60 accepted the incoming call. In process 125, the apparatus 80 sends the serial number residing in its memory 92 to the local call manager 60. The local call manager 60 authenticates the received serial number in process 128. In process 132, the local call manager 60 sends the alert signal to the apparatus 80. Upon receiving the alert signal, the apparatus 80 terminates the call.<br>
Of the four types of triggering signal that can be used to trigger the apparatus 80, only one type needs to be used to ensure proper detection by the apparatus 80. All these types of triggering are discussed in the following paragraphs.<br>
The local telephone central office alerts the apparatus 80 to an incoming call by applying ring current to the TIP and RING leads at point 61. The ring detector 81 detects the ringing current and coupled to the microcontroller 88 via capacitors and diodes. Once interrupted by the ringing signal, the microcontroller 88 goes into the state to check for more ringing current.<br>
The local telephone central office can also alert the apparatus 80 of an incoming call by applying a voltage line reversal signal to the TIP and RING leads at point 61. The voltage line reversal detector 98 can be implemented to detect the voltage line reversal and couple it to the microcontroller 88 via capacitors and diodes. Once interrupted by the voltage line reversal, the microcontroller 88 goes into the state to check for ringing signals.<br>
The local telephone central office can also alert the apparatus of an incoming call by sending a DTMF signal to the TIP and RING leads at point 61. The DTMF decoder 83 detects the DTMF signal and coupled it to the microcontroller 88. Once the DTMF signal Is decoded, the microcontroller 88 goes into the state to check lor ringing signals.<br><br>
The DTMF decoder 83 also has the function to receive and decode the DTMF<br>
formatted alert signals that carry the information of activating the sight and sound<br>
devices transmitted from the local call manager 60. For example, a Holtek HT9170<br>
may be used for this purpose, <br>
The local telephone central office can also alert the apparatus of an incoming call by sending a FSK signal to the TIP and RING leads at point 61. The FSK decoder 82 detects the FSK signal and couples it to the microcontroller 88. Once the FSK signal is decoded, the microcontroller 88 goes into the state to checlkfor ringing signals. For example, a Realtek RT8512 may be used for this purpose.<br>
If the alert signals are FSK formatted, the FSK decoder 82 also has the function to receive and decode the FSK signals that carry the information of activating the sight    and sound devices transmitted from the local call manager 60. For example, a Holtek's HT917D may be used for this purpose.<br>
Users 1, 4 can establish an internet connection through an Internet sen/ice provider (ISP) 5 located in country B via country B's public sw/itching telephone network (PSTN) 10, 11, 650. Users 2, 3 can establish an Internet connection through an ISP<br><br>
 6 in country A via country A's PSTN 610, 620, 630. A local call manager 60, 600, 30, 640 is associated with each area code PSTN 10, 610, 630,650 respectively.<br>
At the request of any of the users 1,2,3,4 the respective ISP 5, 6 can connect the user to a central call manager 50 via the Internet using the respective PSTN 11, 620. The central call manager 50 may be located in country A, country B or a different country and is a server which provides a web page style interface to permit any of the users 1, 2, 3. 4 to request and establish an internet communication link with any of the other users of the system.<br>
Telephone calls made within the same telephone area code are nonnally classified as local connections and are usually less expensive than other telephone calls made between different area codes or different countries. Therefore, the local call<br><br>
managers 60, 600, 30, 640 are located one in each respective telephone area code B2, A2, A1, B1. For example, in the United States of America, there would be at least one local call managers for each telephone area code. Examples of US telephone area codes are: Chicago312, Denver 303, Houston 713. Los Angeles 213, Miami 305, New York 212, Oakland 510, Philadelphia 215, San Francisco 415, and Washington DC 202. The number of local call managers located in any one country would therefore be dependent on the number of telephone area codes within that country. For example, for a small country such as Singapore, with only one telephone area code, only one local call manager may be provided.<br>
Figure 2 is a schematic diagram showing an example of typical information flow when a call is made from user 3 (calling party) of Figure 1 to user 1 (called party) of Figure 1. Initially, user 3 establishes an Internet connection with the central call manager 50. User 3 then makes a request to the central call manager 50 for an internet communication link with user 1. The information of the calling party and called party are routed by the central call manager 50 to the local call manager 60 for user 1 via the PSTN 11 for country B and the local PSTN 10 for user 1. The local call manager 60 upon receiving the information will dial the telephone number of the telephone line 21. This will cause the line 21 to ring and this is detected by the call notification apparatus 80, which is coupled to the telephone line 21.<br>
Typically, the local call manager 60 will permit the line 21 to ring only once and will then terminate the call. This permits the call notification apparatus 80 to distinguish between a call made by the local call manager 60 and a normal telephone call, as with normal telephone calls the line will normally ring more than once. Therefore, the call notification apparatus 80 is activated when it detects that the telephone line has rung only once.<br>
When the call notification apparatus 80 detects a call from the local call manager 60 it automatically initiates a call confirmation procedure with the local call manager 60. This is involves the call notifEcation apparatus 80 calling back the local call manager 60 and passing an identity code to the local call manager. If the identity code<br><br>
corresponds to the identity code of the calJed party with whom the user 3 is trying to establish the communication link, the local call manager issues a call accept signal to the apparatus 80. The apparatus 80 then tenninates the call with the local call manager and generates a notification signal to the user 1 to advise the user 1 of an incoming Internet communication. The user 1 can then establish an internet connection through ISP 5 and connect to the central call manager 50 to establish the Internet communication link with the user 3.<br>
Figures 4a, 4b and 4c and 9 are flow diagrams that show the establishing of the communication link shown in Figure 2 in more detail. Process 102 is a routine where the user 3 (the calling party) logs on to the web site hosted by the central call manager 50. Process 103 is a routine where the calling party provides a password for access to the web site and user 1's (the called party's) telephone number. Process 106 is a routine where the web site authenticates the information entered by the calling party. If the information provided is incorrect, the calling party is required to re-enter the information. After checking that the information is correct 107, process 108 instructs the web site to send the calling party and called party's telephone numbers to the local call manager 60 located within the same telephone area code as the called party. Process 110 allows the local call manager 60 at the called party   location to receive the called party telephone number sent from the web site. Process 112 is a routine where the local call manager 60 initiates a triggering signal to the called party apparatus 80 via the PSTN 10.<br>
Process 113 is a routine that sets the local call manager 60 to monitor the call progress tone. Upon confirmation in process 116 that the first ringing tone has been sent to the apparatus 80. the triggering signal is terminated in process 118. In process 120, the local call manager 60 waits for the apparatus 80 to call back. The apparatus 80 then goes off-hook and dials the local call manager 60 using a pre¬programmed telephone number. The procedure followed by the apparatus 80 is shown in Figure 9.<br><br>
Figure 9 is a flow diagram shov/ing operation of the apparatus 80. Once the power<br>
has been switched on, the apparatus 80 goes into idle mode to save on power<br>
consumption as in process 802. This is critical for maintaining long battery life span if<br>
the apparatus 80 is powered by batteries. An incoming triggering signal activates the<br>
microcontroller 88 to detect the very first triggering signal as in process 803. In<br>
process 805 and 807, the microcontroller 88 waits for subsequent ringing signals. If<br>
the incremental timer has not reached the preset value as decided in process 807,<br>
the microcontroller 88 is made to wait in the Idle state. If the subsequent ringing<br>
signals are detected as in process 809 and 811, the microcontroller 88 determines that the incoming call is a normal telephone call and returns to step 802 to wait for<br>
another interrupt signal.<br>
If the timer exceeds the preset value as determined in process 807, the microcontroller 88 determines that the trigger signal is initiated by the local call manager 60 in process 813. The apparatus 80 goes off-hook in process 815. In process 817, the microcontroller 88 dials the local call manager 60 telephone number via the DTMF transmitter 85. It then checks whether a connection is made with the local call manager 60, as in process 819. If not, the microcontroller 88 re-dials the number as in process 821.<br>
Upon detecting the call back from the apparatus 80 as decided in process 139, the local call manager 60 goes off hook in process 122 and accepts the call from the apparatus 80. When the connection is made between the local call manager 60 and the apparatus 80, process 125 instructs the apparatus 80 to send a pre-programmed   serial number resided in its memory 92 to the locai call manager 60. If the connection is made, the apparatus 80 sends the serial number residing in its memory 92 to the local call manager 60 as in process 823. In response, the local call manager 60 will send an alert signal to the apparatus 80. In process 128, the local call manager 60 upon receiving the serial number authenticates it with the database information. If the serial number sent is valid as checked in process 130, the local call manager 60 sends an alert signal to the called party apparatus 80 as in process 132. It then terminates the call in process 136.<br><br>
The apparatus 80 decides whether the alert signal is received In process 825, it waits for the alert signals until the timer expired as in process 827. If the alert signal is received, the apparatus 80 terminates the connection as indicated in process 831. The apparatus 80 decodes the alert signal sent by the local call manager 60. If the alert signal is affirmative, the microcontroller 88 activates 833 the control circuitry 89 of the sound device to sound the buzzer 93 and also activates 835 the control circuitry 87 to turn on the light 96 for visual purpose.<br>
.  The microcontroller 88 waits for the de-activation action by the called party as indicated in process 837. The buzzer 93 and light 96 remain audible and visible respectively until the timer expired as in process 839. Once expired, the buzzer 93 will stop as control by process 852. The called party can also physically de-activate the apparatus SO as indicated in process 850 and 852.<br>
If the apparatus 80 did not call back as decided in process 138, a counter is set in process 150. The counter tracks the number of attempts made by the local call manager 60 to contact the called party apparatus 80 when an Internet communication is available. If the local call manager 60 has not made the second attempt, the ' process will be routed back to process 112 to initiate the second attempt as decided in process 153. If the local call manager 60 has made the second attempt, the local call manager 60 will inform the web site of the failed notification as in process 157. Subsequently, the web site will inform the calling party via the personal computer 53 that the connection is unsuccessful as in process 160.<br>
There is no best or most effective approach to the number of attempts by the local call manager. The actual number of attempts should be fine tuned during the system implementation and may depend on the telephone exchanges.<br><br><br>
