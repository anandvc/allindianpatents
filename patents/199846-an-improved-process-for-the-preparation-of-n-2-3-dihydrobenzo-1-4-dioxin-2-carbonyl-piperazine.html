				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of N-(2,3-Dihydrobenzo[l ,4]dioxin-2-carbonyl) piperazine.<br>
N-(2,3-Dihydrobenzo[l,4]dioxin-2-carbonyl) piperazine is an important intermediate for the preparation of an anti-hypertensive drug viz., doxazocin. Doxazocin is prepared by reaction of N-(2,3-Dihydrobenzo[l,4]dioxin-2-carbonyl)piperazine with 4-amino-2-chloro-6,7-dimethoxy quinazoline[J. Med. Chem. 1987, 30(1), 49]. However, it was observed that the product obtained by this condensation contained bis-amide as impurity. It makes the product unsuitable for pharmaceutical use as doxazocin base prepared by basification, on analysis showed purity of 91-94% only. Further purification of the base was very difficult due to its polymorphic nature. Large number of references are available mostly of patents (US patents 6,140,334; 6,133,269; 6,130,218) in which doxazocin base has been subjected to tedious purification procedures consisting of four to five steps in order to obtain pure doxazocin of pharmaceutical grade.<br>
Pharmaceutical industry requires pure doxazocin (99.99%) for processing into solid dosage form. In our attempts to prepare pure doxazocin , we found that the purity and crystalline nature of doxazocin were dependent on the purity of N-(2,3-Dihydrobenzo[l,4]dioxin-2-carbonyl) piperazine that was used for the condensation. While it was easy to prepare 4-amino-2-chloro-6,7-dimethoxy quinazoline in high yield and purity, the preparation of N-(2,3-Dihydrobenzo[l,4]dioxin-2-carbonyl)piperazine posed several problems due to its contamination with the bis-amide impurity. It is glassy and difficult to work with. It is essential to evolve a method for the preparation of pure amide not contaminated with bis-amide.<br>
N-(2,3-Dihydrobenzo[l,4]dioxin-2-carbonyl)piperazine is a condensation product of ethyl 2,3-Dihydrobenzo[l,4]dioxin-2-carboxylate and piperazine[eq-l]. N-Acyl alkylenediamines were earlier prepared by the monoamidation of alkylenediamines with acid chlorides. The reaction requires the masking of diamines as monoacetates or hydrogen halides [J. Med. Chem.,1997, 20, 146]. The procedure is tedious and requires i) saponification of ester ii) treatment of the resulting acid with thionyl chloride to give the acid chloride and iii) amidation with piperazine hydrobromide in methanol. There is also one report of the synthesis of N-Acyl alkylenediamines(94% yield) by direct monoamidation of esters[J. Org. Chem., 1998, 63, 10015]. In this procedure, ethyl 2,3-dihydrobenzo[l,4]dioxin-2-<br><br>
carboxylatt and piperazine were heated under reflux for 3h. The reaction mixture was partitioned between CHCl3 and saturated aq, NaHCO3. The organic layer was washed, dried and concentrated. However, N-(2,3-Dlhydrobenzc{1.4]dioxin-2-oarbonyl)piperazine prepared by the above method when coupled with 4-amino-2-chloro'6,7-dimethoxy quinezoline gave a product, which on subsequent basification, gave doxazocin base with 92-95% purity. In view of the above, it is necessary to develop an improved process for the preparation of high purity N-(2,3-Dihydrobenzo[1,4]dioxin-2-carbonyl)piperazine without contamination with bid-amide.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of high purity N-(2,3-Dlhydrobenzo[1,4]dloxln-2-carbonyl)piperazine of . Formula-1.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide N-(2,3-Dlhydrobenzo[l,4]dioxin-2-carbonyl)p9lperazlne free from bis-amide and other impurities by simple acid base work-up procedure.<br>
Accord ngly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of N-(2,3-Dihydrobenzo[1,4]dioxin-2-carbonyl) pelperazlne which comprises heating a reaction mixture of 2,3-dihydrobenzo[1,4]dioxin-2-carboxylate and piperazine with a molar ratio of carboxylate to piperazine in the range of 1:2 to 2:1, under nitrogen atmosphere, at a temperature in the range of 70-90oC for a period of 3-15 hours, cooling the above said reaction mixture to a temperature of 25-30째C and dissolving it in chloroform followed by washing with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution and water respectively, acidifying the organic layer by 10% HCI to a pH ranging between 1 to 4, separating the organic layer and washing the aqueous layer with chloroform, baslfying the aqueous layer with sodium bl-carbonate to a pH ranging between 7 to 9 followed by extracting with chloroform and evaporating the chloroform to obtain the final desired product in amorphous solid form.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the reaction mixture is heated for a period preferably in the range of 5-12 hours.<br>
In yet another embodiment the temperature used In heating reaction mixture is preferably in the range of 75-80째C.<br>
In still another embodiment the purity of the compound N-(2,3-Dihydrobenzo[1,4]dioxln-2-carbonyl) piperazine obtain is in the range of 99.3-99.9%.<br>
In the improved process for the preparation of N-(2,3-dihydrobenzo[1,4]dioxin-2-carbonyl) piperazine heating a reaction mixture of 2,3-dlhydrobenzo[1,4]dioxin-2-carboxylate and piperazine with a molar ratio of carboxyiate to piperazine in the range of 1:2 to 2:1, under nitrogen atmosphere, at a temperature in the range of 70-90째C for a period of 3-15 hours, cooling the above said reaction mixture to a temperature of 25-30"C and dissolving it in chloroform followed by washing with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution and water respectively, acidifying the organic layer by 10% HCI to a pH ranging between 1 to 4, separating the organic layer and washing the aqueous layer with chloroform, basifying the aqueous layer with sodium bi-carbonate to a pH ranging between 7 to 9 followed by extracting with chloroform and evaporating the chloroform to obtain the final desired product In amorphous solid form.<br>
