Custom-built medium-voltage switchplant<br>
The invention relates to a metal-enclosed, air-insulated medium-voltage switchplant having one or more function sections for holding switching devices and/or cable connections and/or busbars.<br>
The known medium-voltage switchplants, which can be designed; for example, as an incoming-feeder panel and outgoing-feeder panel, as a bus-tie circuit-breaker panel, as an outgoing transformer feeder panel, and as a metering panel or spur panel, have previously been arranged in switchpanels having grid dimensions which are as similar as possible. However, this means that the individual components are accommodated inside the medium-volt age switchplants in function spaces which are of relatively different configuration. Thus, for example, the busbars, possibly with their busbar interior components such as transformers, disconnecting switch devices and earthing switch devices, are positioned relative to one another in a close spatial assignment. The structural dimensions of the switchpanels are therefore switched very variably overall.<br>
The object of which the invention is) based consists in specifying for the metal-enclosed, air-insulated medium-voltage switchplants defined at the beginning a concept by means of which the most varied plant configurations can be implemented with a minimum number of modules of different type and, moreover, a substantial reduction in the overall volume is achieved by comparison with the currently known medium-voltage switchplants without limiting the safety requirements which are customary in this technology.<br>
According to the invention, this is achieved by the features that<br>
1.1 the medium-voltage switchplant is implemented as a switchpanel of modular structure,<br><br>
GR 97 P 4099 DE	- 2 -<br>
1.2 the switchpanel of modular structure includes a number of compartments dictated) by the plant,<br>
1.3 the compartments are interconnected by a number of bushing devices dictated by function, and<br>
1.4 the compartments each have at least one pressure relief device.<br>
The metal-enclosed, air-insulated medium-voltage switchplants having switchpanels of modular structure which, in accordance with the most varied plant types, have a corresponding number of mutually isolated compartments, can be assembled in a substantially more compact design than the known plants of this category. The different individual components of the medium-voltage switchplants- are prefabricated in so-called function modules and assembled on site as required. The bushing devices which interconnect the individual compartments render it possible, inter alia, to dispense with the customary expensive insulating measures when extending plants. The dedicated pressure relief device assigned to each of the individual compartments additionally increases the safety of these switchpanels of modular structure.<br>
An advantageous embodiment of the invention provides the features that<br>
2.1 the compartments are formed from at least one module space and/or at least one busbar space and/or at least one wiring space,<br>
2.2 the bushing devices are implemented as busbar bushings and/or as bushing insulators and/or as bushing-type transformers,<br>
2.3 the module space serves alternately, to hold a withdrawable device or a truck-type withdrawable device, and<br>
2.4 the withdrawable device or the truck-type withdrawable device is implemented as a circuit-breaker module or as an isolating module or as an outgoing transformer module or as a measurement module.<br>
2.4 <br>
GR 97 P 4099 DE	- 3 -<br>
The various plant configurations can be implemented in a simple way by means of this strictly functional subdivision into module space, busbar space and wiring space which are interconnected via the bushing devices in the form of bushing insulators, bushing-type transformers and busbar bushings. In this case, the module space is configured such that, on the one hand, a complete truck-type withdrawable device is accommodated and, on the other hand, only one withdrawable device alone can be accommodated in the module space. Like the previously mentioned truck-type withdrawable device, said withdrawable device can then be moved directly out of or into the module space with the aid of a movable truck frame. There is no need in this connection for any structural changes inside and outside the medium-voltage switchplant.<br>
A further advantageous embodiment of the invention provides the features that<br>
3.1	the medium-voltage switchplant has a low-voltage<br>
switchroom arranged in the upper front region of<br>
the module space, and<br>
3.2	the low-voltage switchroom is thermally decoupled<br>
with respect to the module space<br>
Arranging the low-voltage switchroom in the upper front region of the module space likewise results in a user-friendliness which is favourable to the operating staff and is also achieved in a simple way in conjunction with a very compact design for the switchpanels of modular structure. It is to be seen as particularly-advantageous in this regard that the low-voltage switchroom is virtually decoupled thermally from the module space owing to an appropriate spacing. This measure further increases the safety with regard to the thermal impairment, which is only very slight or even non-existent, of the relays and other switching devices inside the low-voltage switchroom.<br>
A further advantageous embodiment of the invention provides the features that<br><br>
GR 97 P 4099 DE	- 4 -<br>
4.1 adjoining behind the module space are the busbar space in the middle region, a busbar interior components space in the upper region, and the wiring space in the lower region,<br>
4.2 the busbar space and the busbar interior components space are arranged approximately one upon another<br>
4.3 the pressure relief devices of the module space, of the busbar interior components space and of the wiring- space are preferably arranged in the upper space-delimiting region.<br>
As a result of the strict isolation of busbar space and busbar interior component space, in the event of a malfunction in the busbar interior component space, for example, the busbars in the busbar space are not impaired or, vice versa, in the event of a malfunction in the busbar space the busbar interior components remain undamaged. This purpose is also served to a considerable extent by the pressure relief devices, which are provided in practice for every compartment.<br>
A further advantageous embodiment of the invention provides the features that<br>
5.1 the wiring space is extendable in the lower region by an additional wiring space,<br>
5.2 the additional wiring space is connected to the wiring space via a bushing device, and<br>
5.3 the additional wiring space is connected by means of a pressure relief device to a pressure relief space provided behind the wiring space.<br>
Using the additional wiring space which adjoins<br>
the wiring space and in which it is possible, for<br>
example, for a cable to be fed from below the medium-<br>
voltage switchplant and connected directly to a busbar<br>
in the wiring space via the bushing device, it is<br>
possible to carry out a change of cable without the<br>
need to perform corresponding insulating measures in<br>
the wiring space itself.	<br><br>
GR 97 P 4099 DE	- 5 -<br>
The invention is explained in more detail by means of two exemplary embodiments represented in figures, Figure 1 showing a possible basic configuration, of modular structure, of a switchpanel of the metal-enclosed, air-insulated medium-voltage switch-plant, and Figure 2 illustrating the different plant configurations of said medium-voltage switchplants.<br>
Figure 1 represents a possible basic configuration of a modular switchpanel MSF of the metal-enclosed, air-insulated medium-voltage switchplant. As may be seen, a number, dictated by the plant, of compartments SCR1, SCR2, SCR3, SCR3', which are interconnected by means of a number, dictated by function, of bushing devices DFE12, DFE13, DFE33', are provided in the switchpanel MSF. It is also to be seen that the individual compartments SCRl, SCR2 SCR3, SCR3' are fitted in each case with a separate pressure relief device DEE.... The pressure relief devices DEE... of the compartments SCRl, SCR2 and SCR3' are preferably situated in the upper space-delimiting region thereof, with the result that in the event of a fault the heat generated in said [compartments SCRl, SCR2 and SCR3 can be dissipated directly to the outside, that is to say from the medium-voltage switchplant. By Contrast, in the event of a fault the pressure discharge device DEE assigned to the compartment SCR3 dissipates the heat via the adjacent compartment SCR2, and its pressure relief device DEE . . . Consequently, the compartments SCR3 and SCR3' are thermally decoupled in practice, with the result that cases of faults occurring in one of the compartments SCR3, SCR3' in no way have any negative effects on the respective other compartment SCR3, SCR3'.<br>
Figure 2 shows further details of possible embodiments of the switchpanel MSF of modular structure, by means of which the known medium-voltage switchplants which, as mentioned at the beginning, can be designed, for example, as an incoming-feeder panel and outgoing-feeder panel, as a bus-tie circuit-breaker<br><br>
GR 97 P 4099 DE	- 6 -<br>
panel, as an outgoing transformer feeder panel, and as a metering panel or spur panel, can be assembled in a simple way as metal-enclosed, air-insulated medium-voltage switchplants.<br>
It is to be seen, in particular that the first compartment SCR1 serves the so-called module space MDR for the purpose of optionally holding a withdrawable device ESE or a truck-type withdrawable device WEE, while the second compartment SCR2 holds the so-called wiring space ASR with a bushing-type transformer DFW and bushing device DFE. . . , which is possibly designed as a busbar bushing SSD.<br>
The third sub-compartment SCR3 forms the so-called busbar space SSR, which serves the exclusive purpose of holding the busbars of the switchpahel MSF of modular structure, in which the bushing insulator DFS and, possibly, a further bushing-type transformer DFW' are located, while the busbar interior components space SER is arranged in the further third sub-compartment SCR3' situated thereabove. The busbar space SSR and the busbar interior components space SER are thus arranged to enhance the plant safety independently of one another in terms of pressure and heat<br>
Figure 2 also shows that the withdrawable device ESE or the truck-type withdrawable device WEE can be designed, for the purpose of implementing the different plant configurations, as a circuit-breaker module LSM, or as an isolating module TRM, or as an outgoing transformer module TAM or as a measurement module MSM. The differing thickness of the lines inside the truck-type withdrawable device WEE for the truck frame (not designated) and for the withdrawable device ESE indicate that the withdrawable device ESE can be moved in and out of the module space MDR by means of a truck frame (not designated in detail) after the corresponding coupling operations have been instituted.<br>
A further variant configuration of the metal-enclosed, air-insulated medium-voltage switchplant is indicated by the broken lines below and behind the<br><br>
GR 97 P 4099 DE	- 7 -<br>
switchpanel MSF of modular structure. Thus, for the case in which cables are fed from below, the wiring space ASR can be extended by the additional wiring space ZAR which, for its part, is connected to the wiring space ASR situated thereabove by means of a bushing device DFE..., with the result that the connecting- cable can be connected directly to the busbar connection {not represented) situated in the wiring space ASR. A change of connecting cable can be performed in this case without impairing the compartment SCR2, the wiring space ASR, situated thereabove.<br>
Furthermore, the additional wiring space ZAR is also provided with a pressure relief device DEE..., the pressure equalization being performed here via the pressure relief space DER which is arranged behind the switchpanel MSF of modular structure and is likewise fitted with a corresponding pressure relief device DEE... in its upper space-delimiting region.<br><br>
