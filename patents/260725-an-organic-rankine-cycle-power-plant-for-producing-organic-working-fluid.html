				<td>ORGANIC WORKING FLUIDS<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to organic fluids, and more particularly to organic fluids for use as the working fluid in high-temperature Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) applications and as the heat transfer fluid in heat transfer cycles for a range of low and high temperatures.<br>
Background<br>
High-temperature organic working fluids have been introduced as the working fluids in power plants and as working and heat transfer intermediates in order to overcome the shortcomings of the use of the water steam medium used for heat transfer or for waste heat recovery and power generation. Heat-energy converters, based on the thermodynamic Organic Rankine Cycle, or similar heat-energy transfer systems, are useful in heat recovery and power generation in particular in remote locations, where the heat is derived from various sources, such as gas turbine exhaust gases, combustion of conventional fuels, combustion of biomass fuels.geothermal sources, solar heat collectors and waste heat in power plants and other industrial processes, for the purpose of producing electrical power in the range of from a hundred or more Watts (W) and up to a few of tens Megawatts (MW). Organic fluids sustainable at<br><br>
temperatures as high as about 350°C are advantageous over water steam, and can be successfully utilized in power generation cycles even at low condensing temperatures and high turbine expansion ratios where the use of steam may be limited due to formation of liquid droplets at the turbine outlet due to the expansion of the steam which may cause erosion to the turbine blades. Because of the nature of the organic fluids they become superheated (or dry) in the expansion process a characteristic which prevents the formation of liquid droplets as is the case with steam. Organic fluids and their derivatives operable under a range of relatively low temperatures normally up to about 200°C are CFCs, Freon, butane including n-butane and iso-butane, and pentane, also including the n-pentane and iso-pentane isomers. For applications where higher operating temperatures are required a transition was required to aromatic hydrocarbons, alkylated aromatic hydrocarbons, fluorinated hydrocarbons such as F75 and F43 and silicone based oils. Examples for alkylated aromatic hydrocarbons are commercial Dowtherm J, which is a mixture of isomers of alkylated aromatic hydrocarbon manufactured by the Dow Chemical Company and Therminol LT, an alkyl substituted aromatic hydrocarbon, manufactured by the Solutia Inc.<br>
The use of the above-mentioned working fluids does have, however, several drawbacks. First, fluids such as F75 or F43 are expensive. Second, such working fluids require periodic treatment and recycling. Third, they limit operating temperatures resulting in lower efficiency.<br><br>
There is, therefore, a need for a stable, commercially available organic compound, which can be operated in its liquid and vapor states in a wide range of temperatures, thus successfully exhibiting improved performance as a working fluid or thermal fluid for either power or electricity generating cycles, or heat transfer cycles.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a highly thermally stable fluid useful as a working fluid for power or electricity generating cycles or as a heat transfer fluid for heat transfer cycles, or both.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a working fluid that has a high critical temperature and relatively low pressures at elevated temperatures.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a working fluid that has a high auto-ignition temperature.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a working fluid that has a low freezing or solidification temperature.<br>
It is still another object of the present invention to provide a working fluid that is benign to humans and to the environment.<br>
It is still another object of the present invention to provide a working fluid that can be easily obtainable by those in the art.<br>
It is still another object of the present invention to provide a working fluid that is operable in a wide range of temperatures.<br><br>
It is still another object of the present invention to provide a working fluid for use in an organic Rankine cycle for electricity or power production in heat recovery applications or other heat-energy conversion cycles, and/or as a heat transfer fluid in heat transfer cycles.<br>
It is still another object of the present invention to provide a use of such a working fluid for heat and waste heat recovery from various heat sources for electricity or power generation and/or other usage of the heat.<br>
These and other objects of the present invention will become clear as the description proceeds.<br>

For this purpose the present invention presents a working fluid comprising at least one highly branched, heavy iso-paraffin hydrocarbon, or a mixture of two or more of such hydrocarbons. Preferably at least one highly branched iso-parafin hydrocarbon is present as the major component (i.e. at least 50% by volume) in the working fluid.

Such highly branched heavy iso-paraffin hydrocarbons or organic fluids have high boiling point temperatures as well as high auto-ignition temperatures, and low freezing point temperatures. They exhibit high thermal stability, and in addition are benign to the environment, and safe for human use. Another advantage is their commercial availability, enabling, through their use, cost effective electricity or power production from various heat sources, or heat transfer in power plants or in other uses.<br>

Non-limitative examples of energy recovering or heat transfer systems and methods of producing power therefrom, that may employ the organic iso-paraffm fluids of the present invention, are referred to below:<br>
As an example of an embodiment of a system in which the present invention can be used reference is now made to Fig. 1, and reference numeral 10 designates an embodiment of apparatus for producing power in accordance with the present invention. As can be seen from the drawing, the apparatus comprises intermediate fluid heater/vaporizer 12 by which vaporized intermediate fluid is produced using heat from heat source 13 e.g. using heat contained in hot gases, etc. The vaporized intermediate fluid is supplied to organic working fluid vaporizer 22 where it is condensed by transferring heat to organic fluid present in the vaporizer so that vaporized organic fluid is produced. Intermediate fluid condensate produced is returned to intermediate fluid heater/vaporizer 12 using pump 19. The vaporized organic fluid is supplied to organic vapor turbine 24 wherein it expands and produces power. Preferably, generator 26 is driven by organic vapor turbine 24 and produces electricity. Expanded vaporized organic fluid exiting organic vapor turbine 24 is supplied to organic fluid condenser 28 and organic fluid condensate is produced. Pump 30 supplies organic fluid condensate exiting organic fluid condenser 28 to organic working fluid vaporizer 22. In accordance with the<br>
present invention, prior to supplying vaporized intermediate fluid exiting intermediate fluid vaporizer 12 to organic working fluid vaporizer 22, the vaporized intermediate fluid is supplied to intermediate fluid turbine 16 wherein the vaporized intermediate fluid expands and produces power. Also here, preferably, intermediate fluid turbine 16 drives generator 18 that produces electricity.<br>
In operation, intermediate fluid present in intermediate fluid vaporizer 12 extracts heat from heat source 13 e.g. hot gases and intermediate fluid vapor is produced. The intermediate fluid vapor is supplied preferably to intermediate fluid turbine 16 and expands therein producing power and expanded intermediate fluid vapor exits intermediate fluid turbine 16. Since preferably, generator 18 is coupled to intermediate fluid turbine 16 electricity is produced. Expanded intermediate fluid vapor exiting intermediate fluid turbine 16 is supplied via line or conduit 20 to organic working fluid vaporizer 22. Organic working fluid present in organic working fluid vaporizer 22 extracts heat from the expanded intermediate fluid vapor and intermediate fluid condensate as well as vaporized organic working fluid is produced. Intermediate fluid condensate is supplied using pump 19 to intermediate fluid vaporizer 12. Vaporized organic working fluid is supplied to organic working fluid turbine 24 wherein it expands and power is produced. Expanded organic working fluid vapor exits organic working fluid turbine 24. Preferably, organic working fluid turbine 24 is coupled to generator 26<br>
and electricity is produced. The expanded organic working fluid vapor is supplied to organic working fluid condenser 28 that is preferably air-cooled and organic working fluid condensate is produced. Pump 30 supplies organic working fluid condensate to organic working fluid vaporizer 22.<br>
The intermediate fluid mentioned in the embodiment described above can be the organic working fluids of the present invention disclosed herein. The preferred intermediate fluid is advantageous since their use avoids problems of freezing, operates without being at vacuum conditions and there is no need for chemical treatment and blow down as is usually the case with water when used as an intermediate fluid. Preferably, the intermediate fluid is useful in a relative high temperature range: vaporizing temperature between about 250°C and about 315°C. At these temperatures, the pressure of the intermediate fluid is between about 9kPa and 2600kPa. The relatively low pressures mentioned above make this type of fluid particularly suitable for use in the present invention. Often, the condensing temperature of the intermediate fluid on the intermediate fluid side of organic working fluid vaporizer 22 will preferably be in the range of about 200°C to about 120°C but can be much lower if need be. Furthermore, the use of this type of intermediate fluid as a heat transfer medium for transferring heat from the heat source to the organic working fluid and as well as producing power from the intermediate fluid increases the efficiency of the power producing system<br>
on a whole. Preferably, the organic working fluid comprises pentane, either n-pentane or iso-pentane, n-butane, iso-butane as well as additional fluids such as hydrocarbons, for example aliphatic paraffins in their normal and isomeric form.<br>
Furthermore, if preferred organic fluid power cycle I can include a pre-heater, superheater and recuperator. In addition, if preferred, generators 18 and 26 can be replaced by a single common generator driven by turbines 16 and 24 either using dual shaft ends in the single common generator or through a gear drive. Most preferred, the common generator is interposed between turbines 16 and 24.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 2, numeral 10A refers to a further embodiment of an example of a system or cycle in which the organic working fluid of the present invention is used and which includes, as shown, a recuperator in the intermediate fluid. As can be seen from the figure, intermediate fluid vapor produced by intermediate vaporizer present in heat recovery vapor generator 40A is supplied to vapor turbine 16A for producing power or electricity using generator ISA. Numeral 21A designates an intermediate fluid recuperator in which heat is transferred from expanded intermediate fluid vapor exiting intermediate fluid turbine 16A to intermediate fluid condensate supplied by pump 19A from the intermediate fluid side of organic working fluid vaporizer 22A. In this embodiment, portion of the intermediate fluid condensate exiting the intermediate fluid side of organic working fluid vaporizer 22A is supplied<br>
to organic fluid pre-heater 23A for pre-heating the organic working fluid prior to supplying it to organic working fluid vaporizer 22A. A further portion of the intermediate fluid condensate exiting the intermediate fluid side of organic working fluid vaporizer 22A is supplied to intermediate fluid recuperator 21 A. In the present embodiment, heat from heat source ISA is added to the intermediate fluid condensate exiting organic pre-heater 23A. In addition, in this embodiment organic working fluid recuperator 27A is included and is used for transferring heat from expanded organic working fluid vapor exiting organic working fluid turbine 24A to organic working fluid condensate supplied by pump 30A from organic working fluid condenser 28A. Heated organic working fluid condensate exiting organic working fluid recuperator 27A is supplied to organic working fluid pre-heater 23A. Apart from these items previously mentioned with reference to the present embodiment described with relation to Fig. 2, this embodiment is similar to the embodiment described with relation to Fig. 1 and also operates in a similar manner.<br>
In certain circumstances, all of the intermediate fluid exiting the intermediate fluid side of the organic working fluid vaporizer 22A can be supplied to organic working fluid pre-heater 23A. Thereafter, the cooled intermediate fluid exiting to organic working fluid pre-heater 23A can be supplied to heat source ISA, the heated intermediate fluid exiting heat source ISA being supplied to intermediate fluid recuperator 21 A.<br>
In Fig. 2, generator ISA is preferably shared by the output of intermediate turbine 16A and organic working fluid turbine 24A. This is because intermediate turbine 16A can operate efficiently at relatively low rotational speeds (1500-1800 RPM), permitting it to be directly coupled to generator ISA whose rotational speed also is relatively low (1500-1800 RPM). Similarly, the rotational speed of organic working fluid turbine 24A can also be relatively low (1500-1800 RPM), permitting it also to be directly coupled to generator 18E. Thus generator ISA is interposed between intermediate turbine 16A and organic working fluid turbine 24A. However, if preferred, separate generators can be provided.<br>
Furthermore, preferably, the embodiment described with reference to Fig. 2 comprises two separate entities, heat source unit or heat recovery vapor generator 40A and power cycle unit 50A.<br>
As mentioned above, the intermediate fluid of the embodiment shown in Fig. 2 can be the organic working of the present invention.<br>
It is to be pointed out that the intermediate fluid specified above can be used for all the embodiments mentioned herein.<br>
Examples of heat sources from which the present invention can extract heat from are waste heat from gas turbines, waste heat from other industrial processes, waste heat produced in cement manufacture and in the cement manufacturing industry, heat produced by the combustion of conventional fuels, heat produced by the combustion of biomass fuel, geothermal resources including geothermal steam and geothermal liquid,<br>
solar energy, etc. In addition, the present invention can be used e.g. for producing electrical power in the range of from about a hundred or more Watts (W) up to a few tens of Megawatts (MW).<br>
Furthermore, while this specification refers to the heat transfer cycle as using an intermediate fluid, it is possible to consider, in accordance with the present invention, the cycle using the intermediate fluid, when referring to power production, as a topping cycle with the organic working fluid cycle as a bottoming cycle.<br>
Moreover, while the embodiments of the present invention describe the use of generators 18 and 26 or the use of a common generator for producing electricity, in accordance with the present invention, the power produced by turbines 16 and 24 or either of them can be used as mechanical power. Thus, for example, they can run a compressor, other loads, etc.<br>
Also in this embodiment, the intermediate fluid can be the organic working fluids of the present invention disclosed herein.<br>
Furthermore, it is to be pointed out that while the intermediate fluid specified above is described as operating in a cycle wherein the intermediate fluid transfers heat from the heat source to a further organic working fluid, the organic working fluid of the present invention can be used in accordance with the present invention in such a power cycle wherein the intermediate fluid is used in a power cycle without transferring heat to a further organic working fluid.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the present invention, the organic working fluids of the present invention may be used for producing power or electricity from a heat source such as solar energy wherein the organic fluids disclosed in the present invention may be used in a power plant operating according to the organic Rankine cycle (see Fig. 3). In such a case, these organic working fluids are heated preferably in solar collector 40B such as a solar trough collector 42B and then supplied to a flash chamber, tank or vaporizer 44B for producing organic vapor which is supplied to a vapor turbine of an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) power plant for producing power or electricity.
