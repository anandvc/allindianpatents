				<td>SINGLE PHASE MOTOR PARTICULARLY FOR SUBMERSED PUMPS<br>
Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to a single-phase motor particularly for<br>
submersed pumps.<br>
Background art<br>
The motor that is normally used is a single-phase asynchronous motor<br>
which requires two stator windings in quadrature for starting.<br>
One of the methods used in order to achieve the phase shifting of the two<br>
windings is to interpose a permanently-connected capacitor at the power<br>
supply of one of the windings.<br>
This kind of motor is constituted by a substantially cylindrical body<br>
which contains the pack of stator windings which actuate the rotation of a<br>
rotor whose head portion protrudes at the pump coupling head.<br>
The combined motor-pump device is used in wells which can be up to a<br>
few hundred meters deep.<br>
If the capacitor is integrated in the motor control panel, it is necessary to<br>
carry its electrical connections to the motor, using a cable with three leads<br>
plus the ground wire.<br>
In order to solve this problem, one possible solution is to provide the<br>
motors with an internal capacitor, providing the connections inside said<br>
motor and leading out of the motor with a cable having two leads plus the<br>
ground wire.<br>
This solution allows to connect the motor directly to the mains power<br>
supply.<br>
In some existing solutions, the cylindrical container of the motor is<br>
provided with a compartment for accommodating the capacitor at the lower<br>
part, i.e., opposite the pump coupling head.<br>
Although the integration of the capacitor in the motor body allows to<br>
eliminate the electrical panel, this solution has drawbacks.<br>
As mentioned, the capacitor is in fact arranged at the lower part of the<br>
motor, i.e., at the opposite end with respect to the pack of the stator<br>
windings and to the electrical connections which normally exit from the<br>
pump coupling head.<br>
The power supply cables of the capacitor must therefore be appropriately<br>
insulated and pass through the entire motor, adjacent to the stator winding<br>
pack, increasing the complexity of the geometry of the motor, or it is<br>
necessary to provide an appropriate winding with the power supply<br>
connections on one side and the capacitor connections on the opposite side,<br>
but this makes it complicated, if not impossible, to produce the winding<br>
automatically.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The aim of the present invention is to solve or substantially reduce the<br>
problems of conventional single-phase motors for submersed pumps.<br>
An important object is to provide a motor which allows direct connection<br>
to the line without interposing a panel which contains a capacitor, reducing<br>
the number of leads.<br>
Another object is to eliminate the electrical connections that pass at the<br>
stator windings or the need to provide a special winding.<br>
This aim and these and other objects which will become better apparent<br>
hereinafter are achieved by a single-phase motor particularly for submersed<br>
pumps, characterized in that it comprises an annular capacitor which is<br>
interposed between the pump coupling head and the stator winding pack.<br>
Brief description of the drawings<br>
Further characteristics and advantages of the invention will become<br>
better apparent from the description of a preferred but not exclusive<br>
embodiment thereof, illustrated only by way of non-limitative example in<br>
the accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>
Figure 1 is a longitudinal sectional view of a motor according to the<br>
invention;<br>
Figure 2 is a perspective view of a capacitor used in the motor of Figure<br>
Figure 3 is a cross sectional view of the capacitor of Figure 2.<br>
Wavs of carrying out the Invention<br>
With reference to the figures, a motor particularly for submersed pumps<br>
according to the invention is generally designated by the reference numeral<br>
10.<br>
The motor 10 is a single-phase asynchronous motor contained in a<br>
substantially cylindrical box-like body 11.<br>
The body 11 contains a pack 12 of stator windings, among which a rotor<br>
13 is included.<br>
The pack of stator windings 12 is constituted by two separate stator<br>
windings, one of which is connected to the power supply and the other one<br>
is connected to a capacitor generally designated by the reference numeral<br>
14.<br>
The capacitor 14 is an annular capacitor interposed between the pack of<br>
stator windings 12 and the pump coupling head 15.<br>
In practice, the head 15 is provided with threaded elements 16 for fixing<br>
the pump, which is not shown in the figure but is in any case of a per se<br>
known type, and the head portion 17 of the rotor 13 protrudes from it.<br>
The head portion 17 couples to the pump shaft.<br>
The capacitor 14, advantageously a film capacitor, is constituted by<br>
longitudinally elongated plates 18 which are wound around a tubular<br>
support 19 and are contained in a tubular box-like element 20 which is<br>
resin-filled at the head for the insertion of the plates 18.<br>
The box-like element 20 is provided with internal and external<br>
longitudinal slots 21 at the inner tubular wall 22.<br>
In particular, the internal longitudinal slot 21a is used for the passage of<br>
the connecting wires 23 of the plates 18, while the external longitudinal<br>
slots 21b are used for the passage of the power supply wires of the stator<br>
winding pack 12.<br>
Finally, the tubular box-like element 20 is filled with resin 24 so as to<br>
insulate the plates 18.<br>
In practice it has been found that the invention has achieved the intended<br>
aim and objects.<br>
In particular, it is evident that the particular shape of the capacitor allows<br>
said capacitor be placed in an advantageous position.<br>
