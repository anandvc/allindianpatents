				<td>Field of the Invention The invention is directed to an aryl aniline 02 adrenergic receptor agonist compound. The invention is also directed to pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds, methods of using such compounds to treat diseases associated with 02 adrenergic receptor activity, and processes and intermediates useful for preparing such compounds.<br>
Background of the Invention P2 adrenergic receptor agonists are recognized as effective drugs for the treatment of pulmonary diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (including chronic bronchitis and emphysema). Pa adrenergic receptor agonists are also useful for treating pre-term labor, and are potentially useful for treating neurological disorders and cardiac disorders. In spite of the success that has been achieved with certain 02 adrenergic receptor agonists, current agents possess less than desirable potency, selectivity, speed of onset, and/or duration of action. Thus, there is a need for additional 02 adrenergic receptor agonists having improved properties. Preferred agents may possess, among other properties, improved duration of action, potency, selectivity, and/or onset.<br>

The compounds of (he invention contain one or more chiral centers Accordingly, the invention includes racemic mixtures, pure stereoisomers (i.e. individual enarttiomers or diasrereomers), and stcrcoisomer-enriched mixtures of such isomer.-;, unless otherwise indicated. When a particular stereoisomer is shown, it will be understood by those skilled in the art, that minor amounts of other stereoisomers may be present in the compositions of this invention unless otherwise indicated, provided that the utility of the composition as a whole is not eliminated by the presence of such other isomers. In particular, compounds of the invention contain a chiral center at the alkylene carbon in formulas (I) and (II) to which the hydroxy group is attached. When a mixture of stereoisomers is employed, it is advantageous for the amount of the stereoisomer with the (R) orientation at the chiral center bearing the hydroxy group to be greater than the amount of the corresponding (S) stereoisomer. When comparing stereoisomers of the same compound, the (R) stereoisomer is preferred over the (S) stereoisomer.<br>
General Synthetic Procedures<br>
The compounds of the invention can be prepared using the methods and procedures described herein, or using similar methods and procedures. It will be<br><br>
appreciated that where typical or preferred process conditions (i.e., reaction temperatures, times, mole ratios of reactants, solvents, pressures, etc.) are given, other process conditions can also be used unless otherwise stated. Optimum reaction conditions may vary with the particular reactants or solvent used, but such conditions can be determined by one skilled in the art by routine optimization procedures.<br>
Additionally, as will be apparent to those skilled in"the art, conventional protecting groups may be used to prevent certain functional groups from undergoing undesired reactions. The choice of a suitable protecting group for a particular functional group, as well as suitable conditions for protection and deprotection, are well known in the art. Representative examples of amino-protecting groups and hydroxy-protecting groups are given above. Typical procedures for their removal include the following. An acyl amino-protecting group or hydroxy-protecting group may conveniently be removed, for example, by treatment with an acid, such as trifluoroacetic acid. An arylraethyl group may conveniently be removed by hydrogenolysis over a suitable metal catalyst such as palladium on carbon. A silyl hydroxy-protecting group may conveniently be removed by treatment with a fluoride ion source, such as tetrabutylammonium fluoride, or by treatment with an acid, such as hydrochloric acid.<br>
In addition, numerous protecting groups (including amino-protecting groups and hydroxy-protecting groups), and their introduction and removal, are described in Greene and Wuts, Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2nd Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, NY, 1991, and in McOmie, Protecting Groups in Organic Chemistry, Plenum Press, NY, 1973.<br>
Processes for preparing compounds of the invention are provided as further embodiments of the invention and are illustrated by the procedures below.<br><br>
wherein R15 is an amino-protecting group. Accordingly, the invention provides a method for preparing a compound of formula (I), comprising deprotecting a corresponding<br><br>
compound of formula (HI), wherein R,s is an amino-protecting group (e.g. l,l-(4-methoxyphenyl)methyl or benzyl).<br>
A compound of formula (I) wherein R is hydroxy can be prepared by deprotecting a corresponding compound of formula (I) wherein R3 is -OPg" and Pg" is a hydroxy-protecting group. Accordingly, the invention provides a method for preparing a compound of formula (I) wherein R3 is hydroxy, comprising deprotecting a corresponding compound of formula (I) wherein R3 is -OPg" and Pg1 is a hydroxy-protecting group (e.g. benzyl).<br>
A compound of formula (I) wherein R3 is hydroxy can also be prepared by deprotecting a corresponding compound of formula (IH) wherein R13 is an amino-protecting group and wherein R3 is -OPg1 wherein Pg1 is a hydroxy-protecting group. Accordingly, the invention provides a method for preparing a compound of formula (I), comprising deprotecting a corresponding compound of formula (Iff) wherein R   is an amino-protecting group (e.g. benzyl) and R3 is -OPg1 wherein Pg" is a hydroxy-protecting group (e.g. benzyl).<br>
The invention also provides an intermediate compound of formula (10) wherein R1S is an amino-protecting group (e.g. l,l-di-(4"-methoxypbenyl)metbyl or benzyl); as well as an intermediate compound of formula (I) wherein R3 is -OPg1 and Pg is a hydroxy-protecting group; and an intermediate compound of formula (UT) wherein R15 is an amino-protecting group (e.g. benzyl), R3 is -OPg1, and Pg1 is a hydroxy-protecting group (e.g. benzyl).<br>
An intermediate compound of formula (HI) can be prepared by reacting an amine of formula (V) with a compound of formula (IV), wherein R16 is hydrogen or a hydroxy-protecting group (e.g. /ert-butyldimethylsilyi) and X is a suitable leaving group (e.g. bromo).<br><br><br>
Accordingly, the invention provides a method for preparing a compound of formula (EI), comprising reacting a corresponding aniline of formula (V) with a corresponding compound of formula (IV), wherein X is a suitable leaving group (e.g. bromo) and R   is an amino-protecting group, in the presence of a transition metal catalyst. When R16 is a hydroxy-protecting group, the intermediate formed by the reaction of a compound of formula (V) with a compound of formula (W) is subsequently deprotected to form the intermediate of formula (HI). Suitable conditions for this reaction as well as suitable leaving groups are illustrated in the Examples and are also known in<br><br>
Accordingly, the invention provides a method for preparing a compound of formula (HI), comprising reacting a corresponding amine of formula (VH), wherein RM is hydrogen and R   is an amino-protecting group, with a corresponding compound of formula (VI), (VIH), or (IX), wherein R16 is hydrogen or a hydroxy-protecting group and Z is a suitable leaving group (e.g. bromo). When Rlfi is a hydroxy-protecting group, the intermediate formed by the reaction of a compound of formula (VIT) with a compound of formula (VI) is subsequently deprotected to form the intermediate of formula (III).<br><br>
The invention also provides a method for preparing a compound of formula (I), wherein R3 is -OPg1 and Pg1 is a hydroxy-protecting group, comprising reacting a corresponding compound of formula (VD) wherein RH and RIS are each hydrogen with a corresponding compound of formula (VI), wherein R3 is -OPg! and Pg1 is a hydroxy-protecting group and R1  is a hydroxy-protecting group.<br>
Depending on the specific values of the substituents, variations on the synthetic schemes described above can be employed, particularly in the order of coupling and deprotection reactions, to produce a compound of the invention. For example, a compound of formula (I) wherein R3 is hydroxy and R12 and R13 are hydrogen can be prepared by reacting an intermediate of formula (I) wherein R is -OPg , where Pg is a hydroxy-protecting group, and R   is a suitable leaving group (e.g. bromo) with an appropriately substituted boronic acid to form an intermediate, which is subsequently deptotected, as illustrated in Examples 65-102,<br>
Additionally, a useful intermediate for preparing a compound of formula (VH), wherein RM is hydrogen and R   is an ammo-protecting group, is a corresponding compound of formula (VD*) wherein RH is an amino-protecting group that can be removed in the presence of R15. A compound of formula (VII) wherein RM is hydrogen and R15 is an amino-protecting group is itself also a useful intermediate for the preparation of a compound of formula (VH) where both RH and R15 are hydrogen. Thus, the invention also provides novel intermediates of formula (VU), wherein R 4 is hydrogen or an amino-protecting group, R15 is hydrogen or an amino-protecting group, and wherein R7-R13 and w have any of the values defined herein, or a salt thereof.<br>
A preferred compound of formula (VU) is a compound wherein R 4 and R   are both hydrogen. Another preferred compound of formula (VU) is a compound wherein RH is an alkoxycarbonyl protecting group (e.g. /ert-butoxy carbonyl), and R,s is an arylmethyl protecting group (e.g. benzyl). Another preferred compound of formula (VU) is a compound wherein R14 is hydrogen, and RIS is an alkoxycarbonyl protecting group (e.g. terl-butoxy carbonyl).<br><br>
Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
The invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of the invention. Accordingly, the compound, preferably in the form of a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt, can be formulated for any suitable form of administration, such as oral or parenteral administration, or administration by inhalation.<br>
By way of illustration, the compound can be admixed with conventional pharmaceutical carriers and excipients and used in the form of powders, tablets, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and the like. Such pharmaceutical compositions will contain from about 0.05 to about 90% by weight of the active compound, and more generally from about 0.1 to about 30%. The pharmaceutical compositions may contain common carriers and excipients, such as cornstarch or gelatin, lactose, magnesium sulfate, magnesium stearate, sucrose, microcrystalline cellulose, kaolin, mannitol, dicalcium phosphate, sodium chloride, and alginic acid. Disintegrators commonly used in the formulations of this invention include croscarmellose, microcrystalline cellulose, cornstarch, sodium starch glycolate and alginic acid.<br>
A liquid composition will generally consist of a suspension or solution of the compound or pharmaceutical!y-acceptable salt in a suitable liquid carrier(s), for example ethanol, glycerine, sorbitol, non-aqueous solvent such as polyethylene glycol, oils or water, optionally with a suspending agent, a solubilizing agent (such as a cyclodextrin), preservative, surfactant, wetting agent, flavoring or coloring agent. Alternatively, a liquid formulation can be prepared from a reconstitutable powder.<br>
For example a powder containing active compound, suspending agent, sucrose and-a sweetener can be reconstituted with water to form a suspension; a syrup can be prepared from a powder containing active ingredient, sucrose and a sweetener.<br>
A composition in the form of a tablet can be prepared using any suitable pharmaceutical carrier(s) routinely used for preparing solid compositions. Examples of such carriers include magnesium stearate, starch, lactose, sucrose, microcrystalline cellulose and binders, for example polyvinylpyrrolidone. The tablet can also be provided with a color film coating, or color included as partiof the carrier(s). In addition, active compound can be formulated in a controlled release dosage form as a tablet comprising a hydrophilic or hydrophobic matrix.<br>
A composition in the form of a capsule can be prepared using routine encapsulation procedures, for example by incorporation of active compound and<br><br>
excipients into a hard gelatin capsule. Alternatively, a semi-solid matrix of active compound and high molecular weight polyethylene glycol can be prepared and filled into a hard gelatin capsule; or a solution of active compound in polyethylene glycol or a suspension in edible oil, for example liquid paraffin or fractionated coconut oil can be prepared and filled into a soft gelatin capsule.<br>
Tablet binders that can be included are acacia, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, poly-vinylpyrrolidone (Povidone), hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, sucrose, starch and ethylcellulose. Lubricants that can be used include magnesium stearate or other metallic stearates, stearic acid, silicone fluid, talc, waxes, oils and colloidal silica.<br>
Flavoring agents such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, cherry flavoring or the like can also be used. Additionally, it may be desirable to add a coloring agent to make the dosage form more attractive in appearance or to help identify the product.<br>
The compounds of the invention and their pharmaceutically-acceptable salts that are active when given parenterally can be formulated for intramuscular, intrathecal, or intravenous administration.<br>
A typical composition for intra-muscular or intrathecal administration will consist of a suspension or solution of active ingredient in an oil, for example arachis oi! or sesame oil. A typical composition for intravenous or intrathecal administration will consist of a sterile isotonic aqueous solution containing, for example active ingredient and dextrose or sodium chloride, or a mixture of dextrose and sodium chloride. Other examples are lactated Ringer"s injection, lactated Ringer"s plus dextrose injection, Normosol-M and dextrose, Isolyte E, acylated Ringer"s injection, and the like. Optionally, a co-solvent, for example, polyethylene glycol; a chelating agent, for example, ethylenediamine tetracetic acid; a solubilizing agent, for example, a cyclodextrin; and an anti-oxidant, for example, sodium meiabisulphite, may be included in the formulation. Alternatively, the solution can be freeze dried and then reconstituted with a suitable solvent just prior to administration.<br>
The compounds of this invention and their pharmaceutically-acceptable salts which are active on topical administration can be formulated as transdermal compositions or transdermal delivery devices ("patches"). Such compositions include, for example, a backing, active compound reservoir, a control membrane, liner and contact adhesive. Such transdermal patches may be used to provide continuous or discontinuous infusion of<br><br>
the compounds of the present invention in controlled amounts. The construction and use of transdermal patches for the delivery of pharmaceutical agents is well known in the art. See, for example, U.S. Patent No. 5,023,252. Such patches may be constructed for continuous, pulsatile, or on demand delivery of pharmaceutical agents.<br>
One preferred manner for administering a compound of the invention is inhalation. Inhalation is an effective means for delivering an agent directly to the respiratory tract. There are three general types of pharmaceutical inhalation devices: nebulizer inhalers, dry powder inhalers (DPI), and metered-dose inhalers (MDI)&gt; Nebulizer devices produce a stream of high velocity air that causes a therapeutic agent to spray as a mist which is carried into the patient"s respiratory tract.   The therapeutic agent is formulated in a liquid form such as a solution or a suspension of microoized particles of respirable size, where micronized is typically defined as having about 90 % or more of the particles with a diameter of less than about 10 u,m. A typical formulation for use in a conventional nebulizer device is an isotonic aqueous solution of a pharmaceutical salt of the active agent at a concentration of the active agent of between about 0.05 Jlg/mL and about 10 mg/mL.<br>
DPI"s typically administer a therapeutic agent in the form of a free flowing powder that can be dispersed in a patient"s air-stream during inspiration. In order to achieve a free flowing powder, the therapeutic agent can be formuialed with a suitable excipient, such as lactose or starch. A dry powder formulation can be made, for example, by combining dry lactose having a particle size between about I u.m and about 100 (im with micronized particles of a pharmaceutical salt of the active agent and dry blending. Alternative, the agent can be formulated without excipients. The formulation is loaded into a dry powder dispenser, or into inhalation cartridges or capsules for use with a dry powder delivery device.<br>
Examples of DPI delivery devices provided commercially include Diskhaler (GlaxoSmithKJine, Research Triangle Park, NC) (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,035,237); Diskus (GlaxoSmithKJine) (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 6,378,519; Turbubaler (AstraZencca, Wilmington, DF.) (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,524,769); and Rotahaler    : (GlaxoSmithKJine) (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,353,365). Further examples of suitable DPI devices are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,415,162, 5,239,993, and 5,715,810 and references therein.<br><br>
MDI"s typically discharge a measured amount of therapeutic agent using compressed propellant gas. Formulations for MDI administration include a solution or suspension of active ingredient in a liquefied propellant. While chlorofluorocarbons, such as CCI3F, conventionally have been used as propellants, due to concerns regarding adverse affects of such agents on the ozone layer, formulations using hydrofluoroalklanes (HFA), such as 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFA 134a) and 1,1,1,2,3,3,3,-heptafluoro-n-propane, (HFA 227) have been developed. Additional components of HFA formulations for MDI administration include co-solvents, such as ethanol or pentane, and surfactants, such as sorbitan trioleate, oleic acid, lecithin, and glycerin. (See, for example, U.S. Patent No. 5,225,183, EP 0717987 A2, and WO 92/22286.)<br>
Thus, a suitable formulation for MDI administration can include from about 0.01 % to about 5 % by weight of a pharmaceutical salt of active ingredient, from about 0 % to about 20 % by weight ethanol, and from about 0 % to about 5 % by weight surfactant, with the remainder being the HFA propellant. In one approach, to prepare the formulation, chilled or pressurized hydrofluoroalkane is added to a vial containing the pharmaceutical salt of active compound, ethanol (if present) and the surfactant (if present). To prepare a suspension, the pharmaceutical salt is provided as micronized particles. The formulation is loaded into an aerosol canister, which forms a portion of an MDI device. Examples of MDI devices developed specifically for use with HFA propellants are provided in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,006,745 and 6,143,277.<br>
In an alternative preparation, a suspension formulation is prepared by spray drying a coating of surfactant on micronized particles of a pharmaceutical salt of active compound. (See, for example, WO 99/53901 and WO 00/61108.)   For additional     " examples of processes of preparing respirable particles, and formulations and devices suitable for inhalation dosing see U.S. Patent Nos. 6,268,533, 5,983,956, 5,874,063, and 6,221.398, and WO 99/55319 and WO 00/30614.<br>
It will be understood that any form of ihe compounds of the invention, (i.e. free base, pharmaceutical salt, or solvate) that is suitable for the particular mode of administration, can be used in the pharmaceutical compositions discussed above.<br>
The active compound is effective over a wide dosage range and is generally administered in a therapeutically effective amount. It will be understood, however, that the amount of the compound actually administered will be determined by a physician, in the light of the relevant circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the chosen<br><br>
route of administration, the actual compound administered and its relative activity, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, the severity of the patient"s symptoms, and the like.<br>
Suitable doses of the therapeutic agent for inhalation administration are in the general range of from about 0.05 u:g/day to about 1000 [tg/day, preferably from about 0.5 Hg/day to about 500 jig/day.

Assay Of Bronchoprotection Against Acetylcholine-Induced Bronchospasm In A Guinea Pig Model<br>
Groups of 6 male guinea pigs (Duncan-Hartley (HsdPoc:DH) Harlan, Madison, WI) weighing between 250 and 350 g were individually identified by cage cards. Throughout the study animals were allowed access to food and water ad libitum.<br>
Test compounds were administered via inhalation over 10 minutes in a whole-body exposure dosing chamber (R&amp;S Molds, San Carlos, CA). The dosing chambers were arranged so (hat an aerosol wag simultaneously delivered to 6 individual chambers from a central manifold. Following a 60 minute acclimation period and a 10 minute exposure to nebulized waier for injection (WFI), guinea pigs were exposed to an aerosol of test compound or vehicle (WFI). These aerosols were generated from<br><br>
aqueous solutions using an LC Star Nebulizer Set (Model 22F51, PARI Respiratory Equipment, Inc. Midlothian, VA) driven by a mixture of gases<br>
(C02 = 5%, 02= 21% and N2 = 74%) at a pressure of 22 psi. The gas flow through the nebulizer at this operating pressure was approximately 3 L/minute. The generated aerosols were driven into the chambers by positive pressure. No dilution air was used during the delivery of aerosolized solutions. During the 10 minute nebulization, approximately 1.8 mL of solution was nebulized. This was measured gravimetrically by comparing pre-and post-nebulization weights of the filled nebulizer.<br>
The bronchoprotective effects of compounds administered via inhalation were evaluated using whole body plethysmography at 1.5, 24,48 and 72 hours post-dose. Forty-five minutes prior to the start of the pulmonary evaluation, each guinea pig was anesthetized with an intramuscular injection of ketamine {43.75 mg/kg), xylazine (3.50 mg/kg) and acepromazine (1.05 mg/kg). After the surgical site was shaved and cleaned with 70% alcohol, a 2-5 cm midline incision of the ventral aspect of the neck was made. Then, the jugular vein was isolated and cannulated with a saline-filled polyethylene catheter (PE-50, Becton Dickinson, Sp^ks, MD) to allow for intravenous infusioos of a 0.1 mg/mL solution of acetylcholine (Ach), (Sigma-Aldrich, St, Louis, MO) in saline. The trachea was then dissected free and cannulated with a 14G teflon tube (#NE- 014, Small Parts, Miami Lakes, FL). If required, anesthesia was maintained by additional intramuscular injections of the aforementioned anesthetic cocktail. The depth of anesthesia was monitored and adjusted if the animal responded to pinching of its paw or if the respiration rate was greater man 100 breaths/minute.<br>
Once the cannuiations were complete, the animal was placed into a plethysmograph (#PLY3114, Buxco Electronics, Inc., Sharon, CT) and an esophageal pressure cannula was inserted to measure pulmonary driving pressure (pressure). The teflon tracheal tube was attached to the opening of the plethysmograph to allow the guinea pig to breathe room air from outside the chamber. The chamber was then sealed. A heating lamp was used to maintain body temperature and the guinea pig"s lungs were inflated 3 times with 4 mL of air using a 10 mL calibration syringe (#5520 Series, Hans Rudolph, Kansas City, MO) to ensure that the lower airways had not collapsed and that the animal did not suffer from hyperventilation.<br>
Once it was determined that baseline values were within the range 0.3 - 0.9 mL/cm H?0 for compliance and within the range<br><br>
0.1 - 0.199 cm H20/mL per second for resistance, the pulmonary evaluation was initiated. A Buxco pulmonary measurement computer progam enabled the collection and derivation of pulmonary values. Starting this program initiated the experimental protocol and data collection. The changes in volume over time that occured within the plethysmograph with each breath were measured via a Buxco pressure transducer. By integrating this gna] over time, a measurement of flow was calculated for each breath. This signal, &gt;gether with the pulmonary driving pressure changes, which were collected using a ensym pressure transducer (#TRD4100), was connected via a Buxco (MAX 2270) reamplifier to a data collection interface (#"s SFT3400 and SFT3813). All other pulmonary parameters were derived from these two inputs.<br>
Baseline values were collected for 5 minutes, after which time the guinea pigs were challenged with Ach. Ach was infused intravenously for 1 minute from a syringe pump (sp210iw, World Precision Instruments, Inc., Sarasota, FL) at the following doses and prescribed times from the start of the experiment: 1.9 ng/minute at 5 minutes, 3.8 |ig/minute at 10 minutes, 7.5 jig/minute at 15 minutes, 15.0 ug/minute at 20 minutes, 30 (ig/minute at 25 minutes and 60 jig/minute at 30 minutes. If resistance or compliance had not returned to baseline values at 3 minutes following each Ach dose, the guinea pig"s lungs were inflated 3 times with 4 mL of air from a 10 mL calibration syringe. Recorded pulmonary parameters included respiration frequency (breaths/minute), compliance (mlVcmHiO) and pulmonary resistance (cm H20/mL per second) (Giles et al, 1971). Once the pulmonary function measurements were completed at minute 35 of this protocol, the guinea pig was removed from the plethysmograph and euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation.<br>
The quantity PD2, which is defined as the amount of Ach needed to cause a doubling of the baseline pulmonary resistance, was calculated using the pulmonary resistance values derived from the/few and the pressure over a range of Ach challenges using the following equation. This was derived from the equation used to calculate PC20 values in the clinic (Am. Thoracic Soc, 2000).<br><br><br><br>
C1-4 = Final concentration of Ach (concentration resulting in a 2-fold increase in pulmonary resistance (RJ)<br>
R„ = Baseline RL value<br>
R, = RL value after C,<br>
Rj = RL value after C2<br>
Statistical analysis of the data was performed using a One-Way Analysis of Variance followed by post-hoc analysis using a Bonferroni / Dunn test. A P-value 
Dose-response curves were fitted with a four parameter logistic equation using GraphPad Prism, version 3.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California)<br>
Y = Min + (Max-Min)/(1 + 10*((log ED50-X)* Hillslope)),<br>
where X is the logarithm of dose, Y is the response (PD2), and Y starts at Min and approaches asymptotically to Max with a sigmoidal shape.<br>
Representative compounds of the invention were found to have significant bronchoprotective activity at time points beyond 24 hours post-dose.<br>
