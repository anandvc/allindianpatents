Furniture hinge<br>
The present invention relates to a furniture hinge having a furniture plate, on which a first hinge part is fixed, and a second hinge part situated so it is pivotable in relation to the first hinge part, which is linked to a support lever and a guide lever like a parallel connecting rod, the guide lever being coupled to a damper having a piston rod, and the piston rod being movable along its longitudinal axis in a direction which runs between an axis of the support lever and an axis of the guide lever on the first hinge part.<br>
A furniture hinge is known from DE 37 41 712, in which a support lever and a guide lever, which each predefine the opening movement of a door, are provided between a furniture pot and a hinge part pivotable in relation thereto. A damper element is provided on the guide lever, which is fixed on a projection of the hinge housing. The piston rod of the damper moves in the direction of the projection, the damping path being dimensioned relatively short, to implement a compact construction. In addition, the hinge housing is   , tailored especially to the damper and may not be used for other hinges. Moreover, due to the fixing of the damper on the hinge housing, lateral forces may occur which may influence the functional capability of the damper.<br>
A damping direction [sic; unit] for hinges is known from DE 201 15 250, in which a hinge is fixed on furniture parts, a damper element being mounted on the hinge. The damper element has a separate housing and a piston rod movable in relation to the housing. The overall size of the hinge having the damper is thus relatively large and the mounting is additionally complex.<br>
WO 03/093616 discloses a multi-joint hinge, in which a plurality of pivotable joint links are provided between two hinge parts, a damping device being situated on one hinge part. Because of the open construction, there is a danger of injury here during movement of the components and the overall size of the hinge is not suitable for all applications.<br>
 <br>
EP 1 555 372 discloses a hinge in which the damper extends over the entire length of the hinge arm. The adjustment of the vertical and lateral position of the hinge is performed using adjustment screws which work together with a part introduced into the hinge arm, which correspondingly has a taller construction to provide the damper volume. In the event of a modification of the hinge for another installation situation, with an otherwise identical configuration of the damper in relation to the hinge arm, at least one additional deflection lever having corresponding joint is installed to then allow a corresponding right-angle bend, This requires additional components and increases the complexity of the hinge. The great height of the hinge arm, in which the voluminous damper is located in addition to the required adjustment mechanism, is also a disadvantage.<br>
It is therefore the object of the present invention to provide a furniture hinge having a damping function which is compactly constructed and allows easy mounting.<br>
This object is achieved by a furniture hinge having the features of Claim 1.<br>
In the hinge according to the invention, the damper is situated in a direction along the piston rod between the adapter and the guide lever, so that a more compact construction of the hinge is provided without the functionality being impaired. The damper may thus be integrated easily in a housing of a hinge, the piston of the damper running parallel to a longitudinal extension of the housing and being situated between the two axes of the support lever and the guide lever. Due lo the linking of the second hinge part via a parallel connecting rod made of support lever and guide lever, the axes of the support lever and the guide lever must be situated at a certain distance from one another in any case, so that the piston rod of the damper may be active in this intermediate space for a compact construction, so that it does not enlarge the housing construction of the hinge. For an especially compact construction, a tip of the piston rod may engage in a closed position between the two axes of the guide lever and the support lever, in addition, existing hinge forms may be used per se to integrate the damper.<br>
 <br>
According to a preferred embodimenl of the invention, setting means are provided on the adapter and the first hinge part, which are situated adjacent to the damper.<br>
The first hinge part is preferably implemented as the housing in which the damper and the adapter are received. The damper and other movable components are thus situated protected and the risk of injury is also reduced.<br>
A boom may be implemented on the guide lever, on which the piston rod of the damper is fixed. The furniture hinge may thus be implemented using relatively few components and the piston rod may be linked to the boom so it is rotatable, in addition, the damper maybe retained so it is pivotable on the first hinge part, so that no lateral forces act on the piston rod and the surrounding damper housing. The rotational axis of the damper on the hinge part may be situated in extension of the piston rod, so that only forces in the direction of the piston rod are transmitted in the damper.<br>
The damper preferably has a cylindrical housing on which laterally projecting pins are implemented, which engage in openings on the first hinge part. The damper may thus be mounted easily on the hinge part, in that the pins are inserted in the corresponding openings. The pins may simultaneously also form the rotational axis of the housing of the damper.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention, the damper has a lower resistance in an opening direction than in the closing direction. This is because particularly for furniture doors it is desirable if the opening movement occurs smoothly, but damping occurs shortly before the closed position during closing, so that it suffices if the damper is essentially active in one direction. The furniture hinge may be pre-tensioned in the closed position via a spring, so that upon closing both the damper and also the spring are active, which then holds a furniture door in the closed position.<br>
The invention is explained in greater detail hereafter on the basis of multiple exemplary embodiments with reference to the appended drawings. In the figures:<br>
 <br>
Figure 1	shows a perspective view of an exemplary embodiment of a<br>
furniture hinge according to the invention;<br>
Figure 2	shows a sectional side view of the furniture hinge of Figure 1 in<br>
the open position;<br>
Figure 3	shows a sectional side view of the furniture hinge of Figure ! in<br>
the closed position;<br>
Figures 4 through 6    show multiple views of a furniture hinge according to a second embodiment;<br>
Figures 7 through 9    show multiple views of a furniture hinge according to a third embodiment; and<br>
Figures 10 through 12 show multiple views of a furniture hinge according to a fourth embodiment.<br>
A furniture hinge 1 comprises a mounting plate 2, which may be fixed on a furniture body by screws, for example. An adapter 3, which is situated in a first hinge part 16 implemented as a housing, is situated on the mounting plate 2. The first hinge part 16 is connected in an articulated way to a second hinge part 4, on which a pot 5 is implemented, which is insertable into a corresponding receptacle on a furniture door, for example. The second hinge part 4 has a plate around the pot 5, on which openings 6 are implemented for the screw connections.<br>
The second hinge part 4 is connected in an articulated way via a support lever 7 and a guide lever 9 to the first hinge part 16, the support lever 7 being rotalabie on the second hinge part 4 via an axis 17 and the guide lever 9 being situated so it is rotatabje on the second hinge part 4 via an axis 18, Furthermore, a rotational axis 8 for linking the support<br>
 <br>
lever 7 and a rotational axis 10 for linking the guide lever 9 are implemented on the first hinge part 16. The first hinge part 16 is thus pivotabie in relation to the second hinge part 4, the support lever 7 and the guide lever 9 predefining the pivot movement like a parallel connecting rod,<br>
A boom 11 is implemented on the guide lever 9, to which a damper 12 is coupled. The damper 12 has a linearly movable piston rod 20, which is connected to the boom 11 so it is rotatable. A plate 23 is fixed on the piston rod 20, against which the body 21 presses, plate 23 and body 21 being movable in a cylindrical housing section of the damper 12. A seal element 22 is situated on the body 21 on the circumference. The damper 12 is implemented as a traction damper, i.e., the damping force occurs when the piston rod 20 is pulled on via the boom 11, while only a reduced damping force acts in the opposing direction. Only a slight damping force is thus detectable during opening of a furniture door, while a higher damping force is provided during closing of the furniture door. The damper 12 may be implemented as a hydraulic or pneumatic damper, for example.<br>
The damper 12 is mounted so it is rotatable around an axis 24, which is situated in the elongation of the piston rod 20. A longitudinal axis of the piston rod 20 intersects with the rotational axis 24, so that only forces in the direction of the piston rod 20, and no lateral forces, may be absorbed via the damper 12. The axis 24 is elongated outwards by pins 13, which are fixed on the housing 12. The pins 13 engage in openings on the first hinge part 16, so that the damper 12 is received so it is pivotabie in the first hinge part i 6.<br>
The damper 12 comprises a cylindrical inner chamber 25, in which the piston body 21 is displaceable. Upon movement of the piston body 21 with the piston rod 20, a volume compensation must be performed, because the volume of the piston rod 20 within the damper increases or decreases. For this purpose, an oblong extension 26 is implemented adjacent to the axis 24, which has a smaller cross-section, preferably less than 50%, than the cylindrical inner chamber 25 and extends parallel to the piston rod 20. The extension 26 is situated laterally offset to the axis of the piston rod 20. An elastic element such as foam rubber is contained in the extension 26, which allows a volume compensation. The<br>
 <br>
installation space within the hinge housing may be optimaiiy used by the tubular design of the extension 26, Instead of an elastic material, a mechanical compensation element, such as a compensation piston, may also be received in the extension 26.<br>
Furthermore, setting mechanisms are also provided on the first hinge part 16, a screw 14 being provided for contact adjustment and a screw 15 being provided for depth adjustment. It is also possible to situate still further adjustment mechanisms on the first hinge part 16.<br>
The furniture hinge is shown in the open positiotion Figure 2. The pot 5 of the second hinge part 4 is situated essentially parallel to the piston rod 20 and a longitudinal extension of the first hinge part 16. For closing, the second hinge part 4 is pivoted, because of which the piston rod 20 is moved to the left in the damper 12 until the final position shown in Figure 3 is reached. In this closed position, "a tip of the piston rod 20 is nearly located between the rotational axis 8 of the support lever 7 and the rotational axis 10 of the guide lever 9. An elongation of the piston rod 20 extends at least between the two rotational axes 8 and 10. Furthermore, a spring 19 is situated around a rotational axis 8, which pre-tensions the furniture hinge in the closed position, the spring 19 only being active at the end of the closing movement.<br>
A second embodiment of a furniture hinge 1' according to the invention is shown in Figures 4 through 6, which is implemented similarly to the furniture hinge 1, identical components being provided with identical reference numerals. In this exemplary embodiment, the first hinge part 16' is implemented as bent somewhat more strongly and the damper 12 is mounted spaced apart somewhat further from the mounting plate 2, This allows another opening movement to be implemented, the second hinge part 4 again being linked via a support lever 7 and a guide lever 9 on the first hinge part 16'. The damper 12 is retained on the first hinge part 16' so it is pivotable around a rotational axis 24 and comprises a cylindrical inner chamber 25' and two segmented chambers 26' adjacent to the continuous axis 24 for the volume compensation, which are each filled<br>
 <br>
with an elastic materia!. An elongation of the piston rod 20 also extends between the two rotational axes 8 and 10 in this embodiment, as shown in Figures 5 and 6.<br>
A third embodiment of a furniture hinge 1" according to the invention is shown in Figures 7 through 9, in which a first hinge part 16" is connected in an articulated way to a hinge part 4, a parallel connecting rod again being provided, which is formed by the support lever 7 and the guide lever 9. The first hinge part 16" has a receptacle for the hinge 12, which projects upward from the mounting plate 2 and has a stronger bend than in the preceding exemplary embodiments to allow a different pivot movement. The function of the support lever 7 and the guide lever 9 and of the damper 12 is as in the preceding exemplary embodiments, however, the configuration of the damper 12 being selected in such a way that it is fixed on the first hinge part 16" so it is pivotable around the rotational axis 24 and a piston rod 20 is situated in such a way that a longitudinal axis of the piston rod 20 engages on the first hinge part 16" between the rotational axes 8 and 10 of the support lever 7 and the guide lever 9.<br>
A fourth embodiment of a furniture hinge 1'" is shown in Figures 10 through 12, in which identical components are again provided with identical reference numerals. In this embodiment, the first hinge part 16'" is implemented as even more strongly bent and has a receptacle for the damper 12 situated inclined in relation to the mounting plate 2. A second hinge part 4 having a pot 5 is again fixed on the first hinge part 16'" via a support lever 7 and a guide lever 9, the relative movement between the second hinge part 4 and the first hinge part 16'" being predefined like a parallel connecting rod. The damper 12 is received protected in a receptacle of the first hinge part 16'", a piston rod 20 having a longitudinal axis which runs between the rotational axis 8 and the rotational axis 10 of the support lever 7 and the guide lever 9. The damper 12 is again situated on the first hinge part 16'" so it is rotatable around an axis 24.<br>
The same damper 12 may thus be used for the different furniture hinges 1, 1', 1", and 1'". Other components may also be used having identical constructions in the various designs.<br>
 <br>
An essential advantage in the design of the hinge according to the invention is that the geometry in the area hinge arm/adapter/contact and depth adjustment and mounting plate on one hand and in the area furniture pot/support and guide levers and damper on the other hand remains unchanged when the hinge components are altered for the purpose of adaptation to specific furniture requirements, for example, bending with/without additional incline.<br>
