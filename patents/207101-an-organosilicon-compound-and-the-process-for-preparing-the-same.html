Description<br>
The present invention provides an organosilicon compound, a process for its preparation and its use.<br>
It is known that sulfur-containing organosilicon compounds such as 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane, 3-mercapto-propyltriethoxysilane, 3-thiocyanatopropyltriethoxysilane or bis-(3-[triethoxysilyl]-propyl)tetrasulfane are used as silane bonding agents or reinforcing additives in oxidically filled rubber mixtures. The rubber mixtures are used, inter alia, for industrial rubber items and for parts of rubber types, in particular for treads (IN 140550,<br>
IN 140550, IN 140550).<br>
It is also known that the alkoxysilyl function, generally a trimethoxysilyl or triethoxysilyl group, reacts with silanol groups on the fillers, generally silica, during mixing-preparation and thus the silane becomes fixed onto the surface of the filler. Production of the filler/rubber bond then takes place during the vulcanisation process, via the sulfur groupings on the fixed silane. Accordingly, the resulting properties of this type of vulcanisate, for a given constant amount of silane, depends critically on how high the coupling yield of the silane is and what network structure is produced. Furthermore, it is known that silanes with polysulfane functions such as, for example, bis-(3-[triethoxysilyl]-propyl)tetrasulfane, tend to participate in disadvantageous premature cross-linking during the mixing process, at appropriately high temperatures. Therefore, it is important that a maximum batch temperature of about 155°C is not exceeded when using these silanes.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide organosilicon compounds which have higher coupling yields.<br><br>
2<br>
improved rubber properties and higher process reliability than the silanes known hitherto, when used as a bonding agent or reinforcing additive in rubber mixtures.<br>
The invention provides an organosilicon compound of the general formula I<br>
R1R2R3Si-R4-S-Zn-S-R4-SiR1R2R3      (I)<br>
wherein R1, R2, R3, independently, represent H, a halogen, a straight-chain or branched alkyl group or a straight-chain or branched alkoxy group and R4 represents a straight-chain or branched alkylidene group.<br>
The straight-chain alkyl groups may be methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, n-butyl-, n-pentyl- or n-hexyl groups. The branched alkyl groups may be iso-propyl, iso-butyl or tert-butyl groups. The halogen may be fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine. The alkoxy groups may be methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, butoxy, isopropoxy, isobutoxy or pentoxy groups.<br>
In the organosilicon compound in accordance with formula I, R1, R2, R3 preferably represent ethoxy and R4 preferably represents CH2CH2CH2 or isobutylidene.<br>
The invention also provides a process for preparing the organosilicon compound of the general formula I, characterised in that a mercaptan compound of the general formula II<br>
R1R2R3Si-R4-S-H        (II)<br>
wherein R1, R2, R3, independently, represent H, a halogen, a straight-chain or branched alkyl group or a straight-chain or branched alkoxy group and R4 represents a straight-chain or branched alkylidene group.<br><br>
3<br>
is reacted with a zinc alcoholate. The reaction may be performed in alcoholic solution. The reaction may be performed in a temperature range of 20° to 200°C, preferably 50° to 80°C.<br>
Zinc ethanolate may be used as the zinc alcoholate. Ethanol may be used to prepare the alcoholic solution. The zinc alcoholate may be prepared by reacting zinc chloride with sodium ethanolate in alcoholic solution. The zinc alcoholate may be reacted with double the molar amount of mercaptan compound II in alcoholic solution.<br>
3-mercaptopropyltriethoxysilane may be used as a mercaptan compound. In one embodiment, a compound of the formula II with R1, R2, R3 = ethoxy and R4 = CH2CH2CH2, may be reacted with zinc ethanolate in ethanolic solution.<br>
The organosilicon compound according to the invention is highly reactive and may be used in rubber mixtures.<br>
Rubber mixtures which contain the organosilicon compound according to the invention as a bonding agent or as a reinforcing additive and the moulded items which are produced after a vulcanisation step, in particular pneumatic tyres or tyre treads, have a low rolling resistance with a simultaneously good wet adhesion and a high resistance to abrasion.<br>
The invention also provides rubber mixtures, characterised in that they contain rubber, fillers, preferably precipitated silica, at least one organosilicon compound of the formula (I) and optionally other rubber auxiliary substances.<br>
The organosilicon compound of the formula I may be used in amounts of 0.1 to 15 wt.%, preferably 5-10 wt.%, with respect to the amount of filler used.<br>
Natural rubber and/or synthetic rubber may be used as the rubber. Preferred synthetic rubbers are described, for<br><br>
4<br>
example, in W. Hofmann, Kautschuktechnologie, Center Verlag, Stuttgart 1980. The rubbers may be used individually or else in combination. Anionic polymerised S-SBR rubbers with a glass transition temperature above -50°C and its mixtures with high-cis diene rubbers are used in particular for preparing motor vehicle tyres.<br>
The following may be used as fillers:<br>
carbon blacks, which are prepared by the lamp, furnace or channel process and have a BET surface area of 20 to 200 m2/g,<br>
highly disperse silicas prepared, for example, by precipitation from silicate solutions or by flame hydrolysis from silicon halides, with specific surface areas of 5 to 1000 mVg, preferably 20 to 400 m2/g (BET surface area) and with primary particle sizes of 10 to 4 00 nm, optionally also as mixed oxides with other metal oxides such as Al, Mg, Ca, Ba, Zn and titanium oxides,<br>
synthetic silicates such as aluminium silicate, alkaline earth silicates such as, for example, magnesium silicate or calcium silicate, with BET surface areas of 20 to 400 m2/g and primary particle diameters of 10 to 400 nm,<br>
natural silicates such as kaolin and other naturally occurring silicas,<br>
glass fibres and glass fibre products (mats, ropes) or glass microbeads.<br>
The rubber mixtures may contain synthetic rubber and silica as a filler. Highly disperse silicas, prepared by precipitation from silicate solutions, with BET surface areas of 20 to 400 m2/g are preferably used, in amounts of 10 to 150 parts by weight, with respect to 100 parts by weight of rubber.<br><br>
5<br>
The fillers mentioned may be used individually or as a mixture.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the rubber mixture, 10 to 150 parts by weight of a pale filler, optionally together with 0 to 100 parts by weight of carbon black, with respect to 100 parts by weight of rubber, and 0.1 to 15 parts by weight, preferably 5 to 10 parts by weight of a compound of the formula (I), with respect to 100 parts by weight of the filler used, may be used to prepare the mixtures.<br>
The organosilicon compounds according to the invention may be used either in the pure form or attached to an inert organic or inorganic support. Preferred support materials may be silica, natural or synthetic silicates, aluminium oxide or carbon black. The organosilicon compound according to the invention may be used on its own or combined with other organosilicon compounds, in particular monofunctional alkylalkoxysilanes.<br>
Rubber auxiliary products which may be used are reaction accelerators, reaction delayers, antioxidants, stabilisers, processing aids, plasticisers, waxes, metal oxides and activators such as triethanolamine, polyethylene glycol or hexanetriol which are well-known in the rubber industry.<br>
The rubber auxiliary substances may be used in conventional amounts which are governed, inter alia, by the ultimate application. Conventional amounts may be 0.1 to 50 wt.%, with respect to rubber. The organosilicon compounds may be activated by adding sulfur and accelerators before the actual cross-linking reaction. This activation may take place during the vulcanisation step. Suitable vulcanisation accelerators may be mercaptobenzthiazoles, sulfenamides, guanidines, thiurams, dithiocarbamates, thioureas and thiocarbonates. The vulcanisation accelerator and sulfur or peroxides may be<br><br>
6<br>
used in amounts of 0.1 to 10 wt.%, preferably 0.1 to 5 wt.%, with respect to rubber.<br>
Use of organosilicon compounds according to the invention in rubber mixtures results in advantages in the static and dynamic vulcanisate data as compared with mixtures according to the prior art. This is shown in particular by a higher tensile strength, a higher 300% stress modulus, and an improved 300% / 100% stress modulus reinforcing ratio. In addition, mixtures according to the invention exhibit a decreased build-up of heat (Goodrich flexometer test), which indicates a positive hysteresis behaviour, and an advantageously low loss factor tan d (60°C), which correlates with the rolling resistance value.<br>
The invention also provides a process for preparing rubber mixtures, characterised in that rubber is mixed with fillers, at least one organosilicon compound of the formula I and optionally other rubber auxiliary substances.<br>
The organosilicon compounds according to the invention and the fillers may preferably be incorporated at bulk temperatures of 100 to 200°C, but may also be incorporated later at lower temperatures (40 to 100°C), for example together with other rubber auxiliary substances. Mixing the constituents may be performed in conventional mixing equipment such as rollers, internal mixers and mixer extruders.<br>
Vulcanisation of rubber mixtures according to the invention may take place at temperatures of 100 to 200°C, preferably 130 to 180°C,   and optionally under a pressure of 10 to 200 bar. Rubber vulcanisates according to the invention may be moulded items, for example pneumatic tyres, tyre treads, cable sheathing, hoses, drive belts, conveyer belts, roller coverings, tyres, soles of shoes, sealing rings and damping elements.<br><br>
7<br>
The use of organosilicon compounds according to the invention as bonding agents or reinforcing additives in rubber mixtures leads to much higher coupling yields, and a correspondingly improved set of rubber properties, than known silanes. Organosilicon compounds according to the invention do not exhibit the known tendency to premature cross-linking of the unaccelerated mixture at high mixing temperatures. Thus, much higher processing temperatures can  be tolerated with greater process reliability. Activation of the sulfur-functional group can take place only during vulcanisation with the addition of sulfur and accelerator.<br><br>

Examples<br>
Example 1: Preparing the zinc organosilicon compound<br>
Example 1 describes preparation pf an organosilicon compound in accordance with the invention.<br>
To prepare a sodium ethanolate solution, 750 ml of ethanol is initially introduced into a11 flask under an atmosphere of argon and then pieces of sodium (46 g, 2 mol) are added in portions.<br>
To prepare the zinc organosilicon compound, 7 50 ml of ethanol and 136.3 g (1 mol) of zinc chloride are initially introduced into a 4 1 four-necked flask with a stirrer, condenser, thermometer and dropping funnel. The freshly prepared sodium ethanolate solution is then transferred to the dropping funnel and added dropwise over a period of<br>
1	hour with stirring and heating to 78°C. The mixture is allowed to stand overnight in order to complete post-reaction and then 446.8 g (2 mol) of 3-mercaptopropyl-triethoxysilane are added dropwise over the course of<br>
2	hours with heating. Stirring is continued for a further 4 hours at 78°C and the mixture is then cooled to room temperature, the suspension is filtered and washed 3 times with 100 ml of ethanol. The filtrate is evaporated down to dryness and the remaining solid is dried under vacuum at 120°C and then milled.<br>
514.8 g of solid product are obtained, which corresponds to 95.5% of theoretical.<br>

compared with the reference mixtures, a very good set of static properties. In particular, the 300%/100% modulus reinforcement factor is significantly higher than the reference mixtures, which indicates a high yield of filler-rubber bonds. In addition, the loss factor tan 5 (60°C), which correlates with the rolling resistance, is advantageously low. Furthermore, the build-up of heat by the mixture in the Goodrich Flexometer test is lowest for the mixture from example 5.<br>
In addition, the advantageous, high, thermal stability of the silane according to the invention is very obvious. Thus, there is hardly any increase in torque detected in the unaccelerated mixture at 165°C (Figure 1). This shows that the unaccelerated mixture with the silane according to the invention is much less sensitive to scorching during the mixing process than, for example, Si 69.<br><br>
