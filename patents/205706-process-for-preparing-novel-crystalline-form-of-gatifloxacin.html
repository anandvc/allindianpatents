Gatifloxacin belongs to the class of fluoroquinolones, has potent antibacterial activity, has higher selectivity against bacteria from mammalian cells which results in excellent selective toxicity and is marketed under brand name "Tequin". Gatifloxacin is preferably administered orally or intravenously and the usual dose is 400 mg once daily.<br>

The Form-0 contains the water content equivalent to trihydrate (11.8%), prepared by crystallization from mixed solvent of ethanol - acetonitrile and is the wet compound. The Form-V having the water content about 1% to 3% is prepared by crystallization and treating the isolated solid with moist gas.<br>
PCT Publication No WO 04/12739 discloses the several crystalline forms of Gatifloxacin, Form-L, Form-M, Form-P, Form-Q, Form-S and Form-Tl along with their preparation methods as follows. The Form-L by recrystallization from methanol: water (90: 10), Form-M by slurrying in absolute ethanol, Form-P by recrystallization from ethanol: water (99:1), Form-Q by recrystallization from acetonitrile: water (98:2), Form-S by recrystallization of wet Gatifloxacin from acetonitrile followed by slurrying in ethanol resulted the wet compound. After drying this Form-S becomes the Form- T2RP.  The dry Gatifloxacin on<br><br>
recrystallization from acetonitrile, followed by slurrying in ethanol and drying under vacuum gives the Form-Tl.<br>
