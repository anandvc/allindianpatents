TREATING MYOCARDIAL OR SKELETAL ANGIOGENIC DISORDERS OR<br>
DEFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA OR DIABETES<br>
Field of the Invention and Introduction<br>
The present invention relates to the use of a plasmid encoding a fibroblast growth<br>
factor as therapeutic agent for the prevention and treatment of hypercholesterolemia or<br>
diabetes associated myocardial or skeletal angiogenic defects. The present invention also<br>
relates to a method for enhancing formation of both collateral blood vessels and artcrioles<br>
in myocardial or skeletal ischemic tissues in a mammalian subject suffering from<br>
hypercholesterolemia or diabetes. The present invention further relates to a method of<br>
promoting collateral blood vessels in ischemic myocardial or skeletal tissues without<br>
inducing VEGF-A factor (Vascular Endothelinl Growth Fnctor A) expression and<br>
causing edema in the treated muscles.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The blood vessels form a closed blood delivery system that begins and ends at the<br>
heart, which comprises three major types of blood vessels, ie., arteries, capillaries, and<br>
veins. As the heart beats, blood is forced into the large arteries from the ventricles. The<br>
large-arteries branch into medium-sized arleries. which branch into smallers arteries that<br>
deliver blood to various parts of the body. The arteries divide again and again until they<br>
reach their smallest branches, the artcrioles. As arterioles enter tissue, they branch into<br>
the microscopic vessels called capillaries, which lie ciose to tissue cells. The capillaries<br>
have very thin walls. Oxygen and nutrients leave the blood in the capillaries and enter the<br>
tissue cells, and carbon dioxide and other wastes leave the cells and enter the blood<br>
within the capillaries. Before the capillaries leave the tissue, they merge to form small<br>
veins called ver.ules. The venules merge to form progressively larger veins that<br>
ultimately empty into the great veins that return blood to the heart.<br>
Tnc walls of all blood vessels, except capillaries, arc composed of 3 distinct<br>
layers, surrounding the lumen. The innermost layer that lines the vessel lumen is called<br>
the tunica interma, and consists primarily of endothelium cells. The middle layer, the<br>
tunica media, consists mostly of circularly arranged smooth muscle cells. The outermost<br>
layer of the blood vessel wall, the tunica exterma is composed mostly of elastic fibers and<br>
collagen fibers that protect the blood vessel and anchor it to surrounding structures. The<br>
tunica extema is infiltrated with nerve fibers and, in the larger arteries and veins, a<br>
system of tiny blood vessels.<br>
Arterioles are the smallest arteries and have a lumen diameter smaller than 5Dum.<br>
Wall of the arteriole consists of the tunica intema surrounded by scattered smooth muscle<br>
fibers in the tunica media. Axterioles regulate blood flow from arteries into capillaries.<br>
During vasoconstriction of arteriole walls, blood flow into capillaries is restricted and the<br>
tissues served by the arteriole may be momentarily bypassed During vasodilatation of<br>
arteriole walls, blood flow into the capillaries increases significantly.<br>
In contrast, capillaries have extremely thin walls which only consist of one line of<br>
endothelial cells, just the tunica intema. They form extensive networks that permeate<br>
nearly all body tissues and almost near almost every cell of the body. The average lumen<br>
diameter of a capillary is 0.01 mm (10µm), just large enough for red blood cells to slip<br>
through b single file. The extremely thin walls make the capillaries perfectly suited for<br>
their purpose, which is the exchange of nutrients, oxygen and waste products with the<br>
cells of the body.<br>
Collateral blood vessels play a significant role in supplying oxygen to an organ,<br>
particularly when oxygen delivery is limited by disease in the normal vasculature.<br>
Collateral vessels can be pre-existing vessels that normally have little or no blood flow.<br>
Acute occlusion of normal vessels (e.g., thrombosis of a large artery) can cause a<br>
redistribution of pressures within the vascular bed thereby causing blood Dow to occur in<br>
collateral vessels. Collateral blood vessels are particularly important in the coronary and<br>
skeletal muscle (e.g., human leg) circulations. In the heart, collateral vessels can help to<br>
supply blood flow to ischemic regions due to stenosis or occlusion of epicardial arteries.<br>
Collateral blood flow may be an important mechanism in limiting infarct size. Formation<br>
of collateral blood vessels is triggered in the therapeutic angiogenesis.<br>
Angiogenesis is a complex process which involves proliferation of endotheUal<br>
cells, the degradation of the basement membrane, the migration through the surrounding<br>
matrix, as well as the alignment, and differentiation into tube-like structures to form the<br>
wails of blood vessels thus resulting in a newly formed capillary network.<br>
Arteriogenesis, which refers to the outgrowth of collateral arterioles, is also<br>
believed to be the most efficient process for restoration of blood perfusion because of the<br>
high capacity of these vessels compared with the capillary network (Canneliet et al., Nat<br>
Med, 2000; 6389-395; Van Royen et al., Cardiovasc. Res., 2001;49:543-553). In effect,<br>
arterioles are considered as mature robust and functional vessels due to the presence of<br>
both tunica intema and media, i.e., a layer of endothelial cells supported by a layer of<br>
smooth muscle cells. Formation of arterioles is a preferred type for long term and<br>
effective neovascularization.<br>
Among the pathological conditions associated with a vascular endothelial<br>
dysfunction is hypercholesterolemia, a disease characterized by abnormal vessel<br>
formation, an impaired regulation of tissue perfusion, abnormal spatial distribution of<br>
blood flow, as well as abnormal microvascular function. Also, kinetics of vessel growth<br>
as well as the nature of resultant vessels are different from healthy tissues. These changes<br>
can be the result of impaired vascular cndothelium which shows a reduced signal<br>
transduction, a reduced availability of L arginine, a reduced expression of eNOS, NO<br>
inactivation increased by superoxyde anion derived from macrophages other<br>
inflammatory cells, release of several vasoconstricting factors, such as endothelin, and<br>
smooth muscle vascular response. In subjects with hvpercbolesterolemia, capillary<br>
density and distribution in the arterial wall change dramatically. Ultimately, they show<br>
dense plexi of adventitial microvessels with marked disorieatation. It is believed that this<br>
may result from different stimuli that may cause stronger or weaker angiogenic response.<br>
Hypercholesterolemia in humans causes a vascular endothelial dysfunction and<br>
ultimately a progressive narrowing of the main arteries. The unbalance in the coronary<br>
blood flow at rest and during stress creates a furtive malfunction of the muscle that leads<br>
to pain and hypocontractility. Usually the supplies are appropriate at rest, but when stress<br>
occurs, the needs increase while the supplies cannot due to the arterial obstructive<br>
lesions. This is the reason why the purpose of mimicking this human pathology, leads to<br>
both the setup of a stenosis for example, on a major coronary artery and the use of a<br>
stress test to reveal the unbalance created at stress by this stenosis. It is also known that<br>
vascular function in patients with types I and II diabetes mellhus is characterized by<br>
impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation. Diabetes mellitus is characterized by<br>
premature development of microvascular and macrovascular disease (Kannel et al.,<br>
Diabetes Care, 1979, 241:2035-2038). It is thus questionable whether such severe<br>
endothelium impairment and abnormalities due to hypercholesterolemia, diabetes,<br>
hypertension and hyperlipidemia in patients suffering from peripheral arterial disease<br>
(PAD), peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD), or cardiac artery disease (CAD)<br>
might be rescued by using therapeutic angiogenesis.<br>
Administration of several angiogenic factors such as for example VEGF, aFGF<br>
and bFGF, HIF-la/VP16 and TGF-b to promote collateral blood vessels, also known as<br>
therapeutic angiogenesis, has been proposed for the treatment of ischemic cardiovascular<br>
and peripheral ischemia. However, the potent pleiotropic effects on various cell types<br>
may limit the therapeutic applicability of some of these compounds. For example, VEGF-<br>
A was one of the most potent candidate angiogenic factors. However, VEGF-A was<br>
shown to generate edema, as well as disorganized, tortuous and leaky vessels, resembling<br>
to those found in tumors (Lee et al., Circulation 2000,102:898-901; Springer et al., Mol<br>
Cell, 1998,2:549-559).<br>
Two distinct strategies for the therapeutic angiogenesis exist. Protein therapy<br>
which involves delivery of the growth factor directly into the isehemic tissue is a possible<br>
option. Angiogenic gene therapy is an alternative possible option aimed at improving<br>
collateral development and overcoming perfusion defects and related ischemia through<br>
the transfer of nucleic acids to somatic cells (8-10).<br>
Animal studies have demonstrated the local angiogenic potential of many growth<br>
factors including, for example, recombinant human VEGF, recombinant PDGF, ox<br>
recombmant bFGF. However, delivery of recombinant proteins, and the systemic<br>
administration of high doses of recombinant proteins was shown to lead to a multitude of<br>
other negative side-effects. Furthermore, the quantity of the recombinant protein required<br>
is important. If too little protein is delivered, angiogenesis will not be achieved. If too<br>
much protein is delivered, the formation of disorganized vasculature beds and<br>
promiscuous angiogenesis can result<br>
Therapeutic angiogenesis via the administration of nucleic acids capable of<br>
expressing an angiogenic protein either in a naked form or via liposomes or viral vectors<br>
have been investigated. Viral vector delivery of angiogenic coding sequence allows for<br>
high efficiency of delivery, but suffers from numerous disadvantages related to viral<br>
vectors uses, such as the occurrence of an immune reaction as well as the possibility of<br>
integration and dissemination. For example, adenovirus gene therapy methods have been<br>
questioned following the death of Jesse Gelsinger in September 1999 at the University of<br>
Pennsylvania after receiving, through intrahepatic artery infusion, El- and E4- deleted<br>
recombinant adenovirus which expressed a correct form of the human ornithine<br>
transcarbamylase. Pathological analyses have indicated that the official cause of death<br>
was a multi-organ failure secondary to adult respiratory distress syndrome induced by a<br>
systemic inflammatory response to recombinant adenovirus administered systematically.<br>
More recently, two cases of leukemia have been reported in a trial aimed at treating<br>
children with severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) which were attributed<br>
to the use of retro virus as a vector.<br>
Both liposomes and naked DNA comprising a DNA encoding an angiogenic<br>
peptide also suffer from a major disadvantage which is a lesser efficiency of delivery<br>
when compared to virus and the level of the protein needed to achieve a therapeutic effect<br>
may be difficult to reach.<br>
Relating to naked DNA strategy, it was surprisingly demonstrated that<br>
intramuscular injection of the NV1FGF a plasmid encoding an acidic Fibroblast Growth<br>
Factor or Fibroblast Growth Factor type 1 (FGF-1), for patients with end-stage peripheral<br>
arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) or with peripheral arterial disease (PAD), meets safety<br>
requirements. Camerota et al. (J Vasc. Surg., 2002, 35, 5:930-936) describes that 51<br>
patients with unreconstructible end-stage PAD, with pain at rest or tissue necrosis, have<br>
been intramuscularly injected with increasing single or repeated doses of NV1FGF into<br>
ischemic thigh and calf. Various parameters such as transcutaneous oxygen pressure,<br>
ankle and toe brachial indexes, pains assessment, and ulcer healing have been<br>
subsequently assessed. A significant increase of brachial indexes, reduction of pain,<br>
resolution of ulcer size, and an improved perfusion after NV1FGF administration were<br>
observed.<br>
Induction of angiogenesis by VEGF gene transfer in patients with hindlimb<br>
ischemia has also been demonstrated Naked plasmid DNA encoding VEGF-165 isoform<br>
was administered in ischemic muscles of patients with non-healing ischemic ulcers<br>
and/or pain at rest due to peripheral arterial disease. Newly developed collateral blood<br>
vessels and improved perfusion could be seen angtographically at 8 weeks post-treatment<br>
as well as capillaries. However, a significant elevation of the serum levels of VEGF at 5<br>
to 6 weeks after treatment was also observed (Isner et al., Lancet, 1996; 348:370-4). Such<br>
elevation of the serum VEGF level may cause promiscuous unwanted angiogenesis, and<br>
serious negative side effects such as edema (26).<br>
Vincent et al., (Circulation, 2000; 102(18) :2225-61) report that administration of<br>
naked DNA plasmid encoding for the Hypoxia Induced Factor la (HIF-1a) transcription<br>
factor was associated with significant improvements in calf blood pressure ratio,<br>
angiogenic score, regional blood flow and capillary density. However, it is also reported<br>
that HIF-1a activates expression of endogenous VEFG gene suggesting the enhancement<br>
of VEGF-Dathway dependant angiogenesis as well as several targets in vivo.<br>
Taniyama et ah, (Gene Therapy, 2001, 8: 181-189) have further reported<br>
therapeutic angiogenesis using intramuscular injection of naked DNA plasmid coding for<br>
a human Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) in rat and rabbit ischemic hindlimb models.<br>
An increase of the collateral blood vessels was identified by angiography and capillary<br>
density as demonstrated by alkaline phosphatase as a marker of endothelial cells, HGF<br>
which was first identified as a mitogen for hepatocytes, has also been shown to be a<br>
mitogen for certain cell types including melanocytes, renal tubular cells, keratinocytes,<br>
and certain endothelial cells and cells of epithelial origin (Matsumoto et al., BBRC, 1991,<br>
176:45-51). HGF was also shown to stimulate growth of endothelial cells without<br>
replication of vascular smooth muscle cells (Nakamura et al., Hypertension, 1996;<br>
28:409-413; Hayashi et al., BBRC, 1996; 220:539-545). Finally, it was shown that HGF<br>
can also act as a "scatter factor", an activity that promotes the dissociation of epithelial<br>
and vascular endothelial cells (Giordano et al., PNAS, 1993, 90:649-653). Therefore,<br>
HGF has been postulated to be involved in tumor formation.<br>
In contrast, administration of a plasmid encoding acidic fibroblast growth factor<br>
(aFGF or FGF-1) was proved not to increase the FGF-1 serum level thereby showing mat<br>
the use of such human FGF-1 expression plasmid is particularly advantageous in terras of<br>
safety as promiscuous angiogenesis or negative side effects are absent The absence of<br>
circulating FGF-l provides a significant safety advantage over other angiogenic factors<br>
such as for example, VEGF or FGF-2 which have been described to leak into the<br>
circulation and lead to distant edema (Baumgartner et al., Circulation, 1998,97:1114-23),<br>
The fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family is comprised of at least 23 structurally<br>
related proteins (FGF 1-23) whose best known members are FGF-1, FGF-2, FGF-4, FGF-<br>
7 and FGF-9. Members of this family stimulates late mitogenesis in most cells derived<br>
from mesoderm and neuroectoderm and influence other biological processes, including<br>
angiogenesis, neurite extension, osteoblast growth, neuronal survival, and myoblast<br>
differentiation. In general, FGFs have a high affinity for heparin. Prior to resolution of<br>
their nomenclature, some FGFs were referred to as heparin-binding growth factors -1,-2,<br>
etc.), and many, but not all, are mitogens for fibroblasts. The members of the FGF family<br>
possess roughly 25-55% iamino acid sequence identity within a core sequence and some<br>
FGFs possess significant extensions, either C-terminal, N-terminal, or both, outside of<br>
this core sequence. This structural homology suggests that the different genes encoding<br>
known FGFs may be derived from a common, ancestral gene.<br>
In addition to the 23 known members of the FGF family, additional complexity<br>
results from the generation of several molecular forms of FGF from a single gene. For<br>
example, the primary translation product of aFGF (FGF-1) consists of 155 residues.<br>
However, the longest form of FGF-1 found in a natural source (e.g., bovine brain)<br>
consists of 154 residues. This 154 residue form of FGF-1 lacks the NH2-terminal<br>
methionine of the 155 residue form and has an acetylated amino terminus. Proteolytic<br>
processing in vivo or during purification generates smaller active forms of FGF-1 in<br>
which either the amino-terminal 15 (des 1-15) or 21 (des 1-21) amino acids are deleted.<br>
As defined herein, FGF-1 refers to the 154 residue form of FGF-1 and shorter,<br>
biologically active forms thereof such as the above described forms deleted of the<br>
amino-terminal 15 (des 1-15) or 21 (des 1-21) amino acids. Historically, the 154 residue<br>
form of FGF-1 was termed ß-endothelial cell growth factor (ß-ECGF), the des 1-15 form<br>
was termed aFGF or FGF-1, and the des 1-21 form was termed alpha.-ECGF. Prior to<br>
standardization of the terminology for this group of growth factors, several additional<br>
terms were also applied to the same protein, including eye derived growth factor and<br>
heparin binding growth factor 1. Similar forms of bFGF (FGF-2) have also been<br>
described. In addition to cleaved forms, extended forms of bFGF have also been<br>
described, resulting from initiation of translation at several different GTO codons located<br>
upstream of the ATG translation initiation codon which generates the 155 residue form of<br>
bFGF. All of these alternative forms of the FGFs contain the core region of structural<br>
homology which defines the FGF family. Many of the various FGF molecules have been<br>
isolated and administered to various animal models of myocardial ischemia with varying<br>
and often times opposite results.<br>
An angiogenic role for FGF-1 was suggested based on in vivo studies (Comerota<br>
et al., J.Vasc.Surg., 2002, 35, 5:930-936). Intramuscular injections of FGF-1 expression<br>
plasrnid demonstrated an unproved perfusion based on an increased in ankle brachial<br>
index, reduction in pain, and an increased transcutanoous oxygen.<br>
The Applicant has now been surprisingly discovered that intramuscular injection<br>
of a FGF-1 expression plasrnid does not cause induction of VEGF in vascular eadothelial<br>
cells, and thus constitues a very safe angiogenesis therapy in contrast with other of the<br>
angiogenic factors, including other FGF factors, VEGF, HIF-1a VP16 and HGF.<br>
Most therapeutic angiogenesis studies have been validated in animal models of<br>
limb ischemia and performed in normal healthy animals, but few have been tested for<br>
their capacity to reverse angiogenesis defects in a hypercholesterolemia or diabetes<br>
setting, wherein endothelium function is greatly unpaired.<br>
In this regard, known therapeutic angiogeoesis have not proved to be convincing<br>
when tested in hypercholesterolemic rabbits model subjected to femoral artery excision,<br>
as an impaired collateral vessel formation and capillary density that could be only<br>
partially reversed by administration of VEGF was observed (26). In addition, therapeutic<br>
angiogenesis were not proved to be convincing when tested in diabetes models, as<br>
Roguin A. et al. (Cardiovascular Diabetology 2003, 2:18) showed that use of VEGF<br>
expression plasmid failed to improve blood flow and to promote collateralization in a<br>
diabetic iscbemic mouse.<br>
In contrast, the Applicant has surprisingly found that a plasmid expressing the<br>
human FGF-1 when administered intramuscularly in ischemk myocardial or skeletal<br>
muscles was capable of efficiently reversing the hypercholesterolemla or diabetes<br>
associated defects in collateral vessels and promoting the formation of mature vessels<br>
such arterioles in a mammalian subject suffering from hypercholesterolemia or<br>
diabetes.<br>
In addition, the applicant has discovered that in contrast with similar angiogenic<br>
factors, the FOF-1 expression plasmid intramuscular injection did not cause edema in the<br>
treated skeletal or cardiac muscle and thus couid be used in an amount sufficient to<br>
rescue angiogenesis defects of ischemic muscles in aggravated conditions such as<br>
hypercholesterolemia or diabetes setting.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>

Detailed Description of the invention<br>
The present invention provides a method for treating or repairing myocardial or<br>
skeletal angiogenic defects associated with hypercholesterolemia or diabetes setting in<br>
which endothelial functions are unpaired or inadequate.<br>
The present method and composition are particularly useful in reversing<br>
endothelium dysfunction associated with hypercholesterolemia or diabetes, following<br>
direct intramuscular administration to promote a net increase of blood vessel formation in<br>
the myocardial or skeletal muscle. The invention encompasses the use of a plasmid<br>
encoding a biologically active fibroblast growth factor and pharmaceuticaUy acceptable<br>
salts and derivatives thereof.<br>
The present invention also provides a method of promoting the formation of<br>
mature collateral vessels in ischemic cardiac or skeletal muscle tissues in a mammalian<br>
subject in need of such treatment comprising injecting said tissues of said subject with an<br>
effective amount of a plasmid encoding a fibroblast growth factor, wherein VEGF-A<br>
factor expression is not induced in said subject Particularly, administration of PGF<br>
expressing plasmid induces the formation of both collateral blood vessels and arterioles<br>
in ischemic myocardial or skeletal muscle tissues, without inducing expression of the<br>
VEGF-A factor. The FGF expression plasmid according to the present invention may not<br>
cause side effect such as edema.<br>
The present invention further provides a method of reversing defects in<br>
angiogenesis elicited by hypercholesterolemia or diabetes, without inducing VEGF-A<br>
factor expression, and/or causing the formation of edema, comprising injecting<br>
myocardial or skeletal tissues of said patient with an effective amount of a plasmid<br>
expressing a fibroblast growth factor to promote the formation of both collateral blood<br>
vessels and arterioles.<br>
The present invention further provides a method for enhancing revascularization<br>
by promoting both collateral blood vessels and arterioles in ischemic tissues of a<br>
mammalian subject in a hypercholesterolemic or diabetes setting, which comprises<br>
injecting said tissues of said subject with an effective amount of a FGF expression<br>
plasmid to reverse angiogeoesis defects. The delivery and expression of said plasmid<br>
unexpectedly results in a significant improvement of the blood perfusion throughout the<br>
ischemic muscles.<br>
The term "subject" includes, but is not limited to, mammals, such as dogs, cats,<br>
horses, cows, pigs, rats, mice, simians, and humans.<br>
The term biologically active sequence means a nucleotide sequence encoding a<br>
naturally occurring peptide or any biologically active analogues or fragments thereof.<br>
Different forms exist in nature with variations in the sequence of the structural gene<br>
coding for peptides of identical biological function. These biologically active sequence<br>
analogues include naturally and non-naturally occurring analogues having single or<br>
multiple amino acid substitutions, deletions, additions, or replacements. All such allelic<br>
variations modifications and analogues resulting in derivatives which retain one or more<br>
of the native biologically active properties are included in the scope of this invention.<br>
The FGF encoding plasmid thus comprises a nucleotide sequence that encodes the<br>
desired FGF protein. These molecules may be cDNA, genomic DNA, synthesized DNA<br>
or a hybrid thereof or an RNA molecule such as mRNA. Preferably, the plasmid<br>
comprises a nucleotide sequence encoding the FGF-1 and thus encompasses a nucleotide<br>
sequence encoding the 154 residue form of FGF-1 acidic growth factor as described in<br>
US patent 4,686,113.<br>
The regulatory elements necessary for gene expression of a DNA molecule may<br>
comprise a promoter, an initiation codon, a stop codon, and a polyadenylation signal. In<br>
addition, enhancers are often required for gene expression. It is necessary that these<br>
elements be operable linked to the sequence that encodes the desired proteins and that the<br>
regulatory elements are operable in the myocardium of the subject to whom they are<br>
administered-<br>
Initiation and stop codons are generally considered to be part of a nucleotide<br>
sequence that encodes the desired protein. However, it is necessary that these elements<br>
are functional in the subject to whom the gene construct is administered. The initiation<br>
and termination codons must be in frame with the coding sequence.<br>
Promoters and polyadenylation signals used must be functional within the<br>
myocardial cells of the subject<br>
Examples of promoters useful to practice the present invention include but are not<br>
limited to promoters from Simian Virus 40 (SV40), Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus<br>
(MMTV) promoter, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) such as the HIV Long<br>
Terminal Repeat (LTR) promoter, Moloney virus, ALV, Cytomegalovirus (CMV) such<br>
as the CMV immediate early promoter, Epstein Barr Virus (EBV), Rous Sarcoma Virus<br>
(RSV) as well as promoters from human genes such as human alpha actin, human<br>
Myosin, human Hemoglobin, human muscle creatine and human metalothionein.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the expression of tbe FGF genes is driven by<br>
muscle specific promoter, such as the murine or human upstream sequence of the CARP<br>
gene which is described in the US publication 2003/0039984, or the cardiac alpha actin<br>
promoter sequence as described in the international publication WO01/11064.<br>
Examples of polyadenylation signals useful to practice the present invention,<br>
especially in the production of a genetic vaccine for humans, include but arc not limited<br>
to SV40 polyadenylation signals, bovine or human Growth hormone polyadenyiaticn<br>
signals, and LTR polyadenylation signals. In particular, the SV40 polyadenylation signal<br>
which is in pCEP4 plasmid (Invitrogen, San Diego Calif.), referred to as the SV40<br>
polyadenylation signal is used.<br>
In addition to the regulatory elements required for DNA expression, other<br>
elements may also be included in the DNA molecule. Such additional elements include<br>
enhancers. The enhancer may be selected from the group including but not limited to:<br>
human Actin, human Myosin, human Hemoglobin, human muscle creatine and viral<br>
enhancers such as those from CMV, RSV and EBV.<br>
Genetic constructs can be provided with mammalian origin of replication in order<br>
to maintain the construct extrachromosomally and produce multiple copies of the<br>
construct in the cell. Plasmids pCEP4 and pREP4 from Invitrogen (San Diego, Calif.)<br>
contain the Epstein Barr virus origin of replication and nuclear antigen EBNA-1 coding<br>
region which produces high copy episomal replication without integration. Other suitable<br>
plasmids are well known to those skilled in the art, for example, plasmid pBR322, with<br>
replicator pMBl, or plasmid pMKl6, with replicator ColEl (Ausubel, Current Protocols<br>
in Molecular Biology, John Wiley and Sons, New York (1988) §II:1.52.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the FGF encoding plasmid present a conditional origin<br>
of replication pCOR as described in the International application WO 97/10343 and<br>
Soubrier et al. (Gene Ther. 1999;6:1482-1488). The pCOR plasmid harbors an optimized<br>
expression cassette encoding a secreted form of human FGF-1 (sphFGF-l) inserted into<br>
an original backbone. The resulting plasmid is advantageously of small size of 2.4 kb.<br>
The sequence encoding sphFGF-1 is a fusion between the sequences encoding the<br>
secretion signal peptide (sp) from human fibroblast interferon and the naturally occurring<br>
truncated form of human FGF-1 from amino acids 21 to 154 (US 4,686,113; US<br>
5,849,538). Expression of sphFGF-1 was driven by the human cytomegalovirus (CMV)<br>
immediate early enhancer/promoter (from nucleolide -522 to +72). The late<br>
polyadenylation signal from simian virus 40 (nucleotides 2538 to 2759 from SV40<br>
genome, GenBank locus SV4CG; US 5,168,062) was inserted downstream of the<br>
sphFGF-l fusion to ensure proper and efficient transcription termination and subsequent<br>
polyadeaylation of the sphFGF-1 transcript This prefemed plasmid is designated<br>
NV1FGF and is devoid of any antibiotic resistancegene. plasmid selectiion relies on a<br>
suppressor transfer RNA gene in the autotrophic recipient strain. Maintenance of high<br>
copy number and strictly limited host range of the plasmid were obtained with the R6K ? <br>
origin of plication. The sequence coding for this protein is not usually found in bactena<br>
but was artificially inserted into the genome of the selected host strain. Thus, plasmid<br>
potential dissemination was greatly limited.<br>
plasmids according to the present invention can be administered to the vertebrate<br>
by any method that delivers injectable materials to cells of the myocardium. Preferably,<br>
the plasmid are administered as naked DNA plasmid in the sense that they are free from<br>
any delivery vehicle that can act to facilitate entry into the cell, for example, the<br>
polynuclcotide sequences are free of viral sequences, particularly any viral particles<br>
which may carry genetic information. They are similarly free from, or naked with respect<br>
to, any material which promotes transfection, such as liposomal formulations, charged<br>
lipids such as Lipofectin™, or precipitating agents such as CaPO4. Plasmid may<br>
otherwise be delivered to the animal with a pharmaceuticaily acceptable liquid carrier. In<br>
preferred applications, the liquid carrier is aqueous or partly aqueous, comprising sterile,<br>
pyrogen-free water. The pH of the preparation is suitably adjusted and buffered<br>
Alternatively, the plasmid may be injected with the use of liposomes, such as cationic or<br>
positively charged liposomes.<br>
The following Examples clearly demonstrate that the plasmid NV1FGF allows a<br>
slow release of the encoded FGF-1 protein at a concentration sufficient to promote a<br>
sustained angiogenic response via the formation of capillary vessels as well as mature<br>
vessels such as arterioles. In addition NV1FGF was shown to be particularly potent, as it<br>
was demonstrated to efficiently promote angiogenesis at a non-detectable concentration<br>
in treated muscles. NV1FGF may thus be used at concentrations which are within a<br>
therapeutic window, thereby avoiding negative side effects due to dissemination to<br>
surrounding tissues or organs or promiscuous angiogenesis.<br>
In addition, it was demonstrated that due to such superior characteristics in terms<br>
of safety and potency, NV1FGF was particularly useful for therapeutic angiogenesis in<br>
aggravated conditions caused by hypercholesterolemia or diabetes.<br>
The reversal of angiogenesis defects caused by attenuated blood supply regardless<br>
of its origin which is aggravated in conditions such as hypercholesterolemia or diabetes<br>
is thus contemplated by the present invention.<br>
Within the context of the present invention, the target tissue thus comprises<br>
muscle tissues suffering from or being at risk of suffering from ischemic damage which<br>
results when the tissue is deprived of an adequate supply of oxygenated blood, further<br>
aggravated in a hypercholesterolemia or diabetes setting. As demonstrated in the<br>
Examples, the intramuscular injection of a plasmid NV1FGF may be efficiently used in a<br>
therapeutic window which is compatible with required standard of safety in gene therapy<br>
and is capable of inducing angiogenesis in an ischemic tissue further presenting an<br>
impaired endothelial function.<br>
According to one embodiment of the present invention, the NV1FGF plasmid is<br>
administered in a localized manner to the target muscle tissue. While, any suitable means<br>
of administering the NV1FGF plasmid to the target tissue can be used within the context<br>
of the present invention, preferably, such a localized injection to the target muscle tissue<br>
is accomplished by directly injecting the NV1FQF to the muscle using a needle.<br>
By the term "injecting" it is meant that the NV1FGF is forcefully introduced into<br>
the target tissue. Any suitable injection device can be used according to the present<br>
invention.<br>
While administration of a dose of the NV1FGF plasmid can be accomplished<br>
through a single injection to the target tissue, preferably administration of the dose is via<br>
multiple injection of NV1FGF. The multiple injections can be 2,3,4, 5, or more repeated<br>
injections, and preferably 5 or more injections into the ischemic muscle of a mammalian<br>
subject suffering from hypercholesterolemia or diabetes. Multiple injections present an<br>
advantage over single injections in that they can be manipulated by such parameters as a<br>
specific geometry defined by the location on the target tissue where each injection is<br>
made. The injection of a single dose of the NV1FGF via multiple injections can be better<br>
controlled, and the effectiveness with which any given dose is administered may be<br>
maximized.<br>
The specific geometry of the multiple injections may be defined either in two-<br>
dimensional space, where the each application of the NV1FGF is administered The<br>
multiple injections may be performed in or around the ischemic tissue, preferably are<br>
spaced such that the points of injection are separated by 2 or 3 cm.<br>
According to another embodiment of the present invention, each of the multiple<br>
injections is performed within about 5 to 10 minutes of each other.<br>
When administering the NV1FGF to the target tissue which is affected by<br>
angiogenesis defects and wherein the endothelium function is severely impaired, it is<br>
desirable that the administration is such that the NV1FGF is able to contact a region<br>
reasonably adjacent to the source and the terminus for the collateral blood vessel<br>
formation, as well as the area therebetween.<br>
Administration of the composition according to the present invention to effect the<br>
therapeutic objectives may be by local, intramuscular, parenteral, intravenous,<br>
mtramyocardial, pericardial, epicardial or via intracoronary administration to the target<br>
cardiac muscle tissue. Preferably, intramyocardial, epicardial, pericardial or<br>
intracoronary administration is conducted using a needle or a catheter.<br>
Preferably, intramuscular injection of NY 1FGF may~be performed into the distal<br>
thigh and distal leg muscles, and in the region close and surrounding the ischemic she.<br>
Also, when administration is performed by direct intramyocardial injection, those<br>
may be performed during an open chest surgery or with the help of a catheter. Catheters<br>
for heart delivery are well known in the art and include for example needle catheter as<br>
described in US patents 5*045,565 or 4,661,133, with position sensor system as described<br>
in US patents 6,254,573 and 6,309,370. Alternative catheters having a helix needle are<br>
described in US patents 6,346,099 and 6,358,247.<br>
In one advantageous aspect of the present invention, a therapeutiLcally effective<br>
dose of NV1FGF is administered to reverse the defects in angiogenesis in a<br>
hypercholesterolemic or diabetes setting. While the effective dose will vary depending on<br>
the weight and condition of a given subject suffering from angiogenesis defects in<br>
addition to hypercholesterolemia or diabetic subject, it is considered within the skill in<br>
the art to determine the appropriate dosage for a given subject and conditions<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of this aspect, treatment is performed with<br>
dose of about 8000ug to about 16000ug of plasmid that is administered by multiple<br>
injections of preferably 2 to 4 repeated intramuscular injections of KV1FGF with an<br>
interval of time of around 1 to 2 weeks or more, in severe conditions of angiogenesis<br>
defects, in order to promote a sustained formation of both collateral vessels and<br>
arterioles, thereby allowing to reverse angiogenesis defects due to ischemia in a<br>
mammalian subject suffering from hypercholesterolemia or diabetes.<br>
The NV1FGF desirably is administered to the target ischemic muscle in a<br>
pharmaceutical composition, which comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable earner and<br>
the NVlFGFplasmid.<br>
Any suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carrier can be used within the context<br>
of the present invention, and such carriers are well known in the art. The choice of carrier<br>
will be determined, in part, by the particular site to which the composition is to be<br>
administered and the particular method used to administer the composition. Formulations<br>
suitable for injection include aqueous and non-aqueous solutions, isotonic sterile<br>
injection solutions, which can contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, and solutes<br>
that render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient, and aqueous<br>
and non-aqueous sterile suspensions that can include suspending agents, solubilizers,<br>
thickening agents, stabilizers, and preservatives. The formulations can be presented in<br>
unit-dose or multi-dose sealed containers, such as ampoules and vials, and can be stored<br>
in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid<br>
carrier, for example, water, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions<br>
and suspensions can be prepared from sterile powders, granules, and tablets of the kind<br>
previously described. Preferably, the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is a buffered<br>
saline solution. Most preferably, the pharmaceutical composition comprises a solution of<br>
sodium chloride (0.9%).<br>
In a preferred embodiment the composition of the present invention is<br>
administered in association with a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). LMWH<br>
molecules and method of preparation are well-known in the art and are described inter<br>
alia in US 5,389,618; US 4,692,435, and US 4,303,651, European patent EP 0040 144,<br>
and by Nenci GG (Vasc.Med, 2000; 5:251-258), which are herein incorporated by<br>
reference.<br>
In a second embodiment, the FGF expression plasmid is injected in the skeletal<br>
muscle of a hypercholesterolemic or diabetic patient prior or after the administration of<br>
an electrical stimulation to the treated skeletal muscle. The electrical stimulation used<br>
according to this embodiment is as described in US2002/0031827, and is applied at a<br>
voltage and a frequency that do not cause contraction of the skeletal muscle as well as no<br>
pain to the patient, as it is below the threshold for muscle contraction. For example, the<br>
frequency applied is around 50 Hfc, and the voltage is around O.lVolt "When used in<br>
combination with the FGF expression plasmid, the electrical stimulation results in a<br>
synergistic superior effect in terms of increase of blood flow.<br>
In a third embodiment, the FGF-1 expression plasmid is BB is delivered in<br>
combination with one or more angiogenesis-promoting factors. Without any limitation,<br>
angiogenic fector may include PDGF-AA, M-CSF, GMCSF, VEGF-A, VEGFr-B, VEGF-<br>
C. VEGF-D,. VEGF-E,. neuropilin, FGF2(bFGF), FGF-3, FGF-4, FGF-5, FGF-6,<br>
Angiopoietin 1, Angiopoietin 2,1 5 erytbropoietin, BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-7, TGF-beta,<br>
IGF-I, Osteopontin, Pleiotropin, Activin, Endothelin-1 and combinations thereof.<br>
Preferably, the NV1FGF is injected in skeletal or cardiac muscle with a PDGFBB<br>
expression plasmid and results in a superior formation of collateral blood vessels and<br>
arterioles in hypercholesterolemia or diabetes setting. This embodiment thus relates to a<br>
method of promoting collateral blood vessels and arterioles comprising delivering<br>
NV1FGF and a plasmid expressing PDGF-BB to a localized area of tissue in an amount<br>
effective to induce angiogenesis within the area of tissue. The angiogenesfe-promoting<br>
fector(s) is delivered by expression from isolated DNA encoding the factor following<br>
delivery of the DNA to the localized area of tissue<br>
The present invention also relates to a method of treating PAD and PAOD, CAD<br>
or CHF pathologies in patients further suffering from hypercholesterolemia and diabetes.<br>
Impaired perfusion in the hindlimb due to single or multiple large vessel<br>
occlusions is the cause of PAD. At an early stage this results in discomfort in the muscles<br>
of the leg with ambulation, leading at later stages to ulceration and gangrene (1). Chronic<br>
cardiovascular disorders are aggravating factors is patients who are already suffering of<br>
ischemic conditions, such as PAD, through mechanisms involving endothelium<br>
dysfunction (2, 3). Pathologies such as hypercholestierolemia, hypertension and diabetes<br>
have been investigated as possible targets for developing experimental models of PAD<br>
(4-7). Nevertheless, in such models of hindlimb ischemia, a critical point is to negate a<br>
spontaneous angiogenic response to allow efficacy of any revascularization treatment in<br>
an attempt to mimic the clinical situation of hindlimb ischemia.<br>
Genetic models of hypercholesterolemia have also been used to assess angiogenic<br>
properties in hypercholesterolemia or diabetes conditions, however in such genetic<br>
models a single alteration of a single receptor (deficit in the LDL receptor in Watanabe<br>
heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits) or protein (deficit in the glycoprotein ApoE resulting in<br>
inceased levels of VLDLs and IDLs in ApoE mice) is generated and do not actually<br>
reproduce the conditions of the pathology.<br>
 In contrast, NV1FGF plasmid was demonstrated to be particularly potent in<br>
reversing hypercholesterolemia-elicited defect in animal models which are very<br>
comparable to the pathological conditions found in patients. Indeed, the pathology results<br>
from a global lipid overload due to cholesterol-rich thet mimicking the situation<br>
encountered in PAD patients suffering from hypercholesterolemia.<br>
According to the present invention, the NV1FGF has been demonstrated to be<br>
particularly potent for rescuing cholesterol-induced impairment of angiogenesis in<br>
patients suffering from PAD, by promoting the growth of both collateral vessels and<br>
arterioles.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a method for promoting<br>
both collateral blood vessels and arterioles in ischemic tissues, wherein endothelial<br>
function is impaired.<br>
As shown in the following examples, the KV1FGF is capable to effectively<br>
induce the formation of mature large conductance vessels (&gt;150µm collateral vessels)<br>
and small resistance arteries (
posterior part of the thigh, which are required to convey and to deliver blood to tissues.<br>
Induction of such mature vessels represent a particularly efficient treatment in most<br>
severe cases where adverse angiogenesis defects are elicited by hypercholesterolemia or<br>
diabetes.<br>
Outgrowth of both collaterals and arterioles is of particular interest in therapeutic<br>
angiogenesis. Indeed, collaterals are vessels forming bridges between arterial networks<br>
while arterioles are mature vessels formed of a layer of endothelial cells stabilized by<br>
mural cells (pericytes or smooth muscle cells) providing bulk flow to the tissue. Capillary<br>
networks are therefore dependent on their presence for ensuring distribution of the flow.<br>
(Carmeliet et si., Nat. Med., 2000; 6:389-395; Van Royen et aL, Cardiovasc. Res.,<br>
2001;49;543-553).<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a method of promoting<br>
angiogenesis with the provisio that VEGF is not upregulated in the treated cells.<br>
The following examples demonstrate that intramuscular administration of<br>
injection of NV1FGF does not lead to local murine VEGF-A induction in injected<br>
muscles and does not lead to murine VEGF-A secretion in the circulating blood of the<br>
injected mice. This is an important aspect of the present invention, which is related to a<br>
new method for promoting collateral blood vessels and arterioles, without inducing the<br>
VEGF-A fector, in a VEGF-independent pathway, In effect, it is well known that VEGF-<br>
A cause serious negative side effects such as promiscuous unwanted angiogenesis,<br>
edema, and potential of tumorigenicity.<br>

least 7 days before initiation of the study protocol. All animals had free access to water<br>
for the entire duration of the experiments. All animal procedures were approved by the<br>
Animal Use Committee of Aventis Pharma and conducted in accordance with guidelines<br>
published by the National Institute of Health (NIH publication No. 85-23, revised 1985).<br>
In experiment 1, hamsters (n=37) were randomly divided into three groups<br>
(Figure 1). Hamsters in the low cholesterol (LC) group (n=13) were fed ad libitum with<br>
standard chow (ref. A04-C, UAR, Epinay-sur-Orge, France). Hamsters in both high<br>
cholesterol (HC) groups during 21 days (HC/21) and 28 days (HC/28) post-treatment<br>
(HC/21: n=12; HC/28: n=12) were given 20g per animal of cholesterol-enriched thet<br>
daily, made of standard chow supplemented with 3% cholesterol and 15% cocoa butter<br>
(ref. 1414C, UAR, Epinay-sur-Orge, France). In experiment 2, hamsters (n=13) were<br>
randomly allocated to two groups (Figure 1). Hamsters in the saline group (n=5) and in<br>
the NV1FGF group (n=8) were fed with cholesterol-enriched diet, as described in<br>
experiment 1.<br>
Example 2: Induction of hindlimb ischemia<br>
After 35 days of LC or HC diet, animals Were subjected to hindlimb ischemia,<br>
according to the following surgical procedure. Hindlimb ischemia was induced under gas<br>
anesthesia with N2O (0.8 Limn-1), O2 (0.4 Lmin-1) and isofluorane (2%) according to a<br>
procedure described in other animal species (19,20). Under sterile surgical conditions, a<br>
longitudinal incision was performed on the medial thigh of the right hindlimb from the<br>
inguinal ligament to a point proximal to the patella. Through this incision, using surgical<br>
loops, the femoral artery was dissected free and its major branches were coagulated. The<br>
femoral artery was completely excised from its proximal origin as a branch of the<br>
external iliac artery to the point distal where it bifurcates into the saphenous and popliteal<br>
branches (20). The incision was closed in one layer with a 4.0 silk wire.<br>
Example 3; Gene transfer in hindlimb skeletal muscles<br>
In experiment 2, saline (n=5) or plasmid encoding NV1FGF (180µg DNA, n=8)<br>
was given blind 14 days after induction of ischemia, through three 50-µL injections each<br>
in Tibialis cramalis, Adductores and Quadriceps muscles of the ischemic limb.<br>
Example 4: Measurements of total cholesterol and triglyceride levels in sernm<br>
On days -35, -7, and +21 or +28 related to the day of surgery, blood was obtained<br>
from hamsters of HC/21, HC/28, saline and NV1FGF groups by retro-orbital puncture<br>
under gas anesthesia with N20 (0.8 Lmin-1), O2 (0.4 Link-1) and isofluorane (2%). Total<br>
cholesterol and triglyceride levels in serum were determined enzymatieally with<br>
commercially available kits (Olympus Diagnostica GmbH, Hamburg, Germany).<br>
Example 5: Quantification of collateral vessel formation by angiography<br>
On day 21 (HC/21 group) or day 28 (LC, HC/28, saline and NV1FGF groups)<br>
after induction of ischemia, an angiographic procedure was performed as follows.<br>
Immediately after injection of ~300 µl of contrast medium (0.5 g.ml-1 sulfate<br>
barium solution in water) through a catheter inserted into abdominal aorta, hamsters were<br>
sacrificed with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital. Hamsters were placed in dorsal<br>
decubitus into a radiography apparatus (model MX-20, Faxitron X-ray Corp., Wheeling,<br>
IL, USA) and. post-mortem pictures of the vasculature from both limbs were collected and<br>
digitalized (software Specimen, DALSA MedOptics, Tucson, AZ, USA). This<br>
radiographic system allows visualization of vessels with diameters higher than 150 µm.<br>
Pictures were analysed off-line by an investigator blinded to me treatment, with dedicated<br>
software as previously described (22),<br>
Briefly, for both ischemic and non-ischemic limbs, the extent of collateral vessels<br>
in the posterior side of the thigh was determined as a percentage of the area analysed.<br>
Angiographic score was calculated as the ratio ischemic/non-ischemic percentages. In<br>
order to check the validity of the method, angiographic score was assessed in six separate<br>
age-matched hamsters not subjected to hindlimb ischemia. As expected, angiographic<br>
score calculated as the ratio right limb/left limb percentages was 1.04 ± 0.18, reflecting<br>
similar vascularization in both limbs.<br>
Example 6: Quantification of arteriolar formation by immunohistochemistry and<br>
typical muscle lesions induced by hindlimb ischemia through excision of the femoral<br>
artery of hypercholesterolemic hamsters<br>
On day 21 (HC/21 group) or day 28 (LC, HC/28, saline and NV1FGF groups)<br>
after induction of ischemia, skeletal muscles from the ischemic hindlimb were harvested<br>
and fixed in a solution of PBS-3.7 % formaline, Muscles from the non-Ischemic hindlimb<br>
were sampled similarly and served as control muscles. Two transverse slices composed<br>
of different muscles (Gracilis, Semimembranosus, Adductores, Semitendinosus, Biceps<br>
femoris), were processed from the back part of each thigh. Slices were dehydrated,<br>
embedded in paraffin and 5-um thick sections were prepared for immunohistochemistry.<br>
A mouse monoclonal antibody directed against smooth muscle a-actin (SMA; clone 1A4,<br>
dilution 1:200, Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA) was used as a marker for vascular smooth<br>
muscle cells (VSMCs) since it is constitutively expressed in mature vessels. The SMA<br>
antibody was detected with a commercially available kit (EnvisionTM+ System/Horse<br>
Radish Peroxidase, Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA) through an avidin-biotin-peroxidase<br>
method. SMA-positive (SMA+) vessels were ranked by size (outer diameter) and<br>
arterioles with diameter 
These muscles have been chosen for their susceptibility to histopathological<br>
lesions in our hindlimb ischemia hamster model, conversely to other muscles from the<br>
posterior side of the thigh (Semitendinosus, Semimembranosus and Biceps femoris).<br>
Typical lesions induced by excision of femoral artery are shown in Figure 2,<br>
Muscles from the back part of the thigh, i.e., Gracilis and Adductores were harvested 28<br>
days after induction of ischemia, and 5µm thick sections of the muscles after HES<br>
staining were observed. Figures 2B and 2C show the presence of mild necrosis (dashed<br>
line) and centronucleation (arrows) in ischemic muscles, respectively. Figure 2A shows a<br>
cross-section at magnification X100 of the non-ischemic controlateral muscles having no<br>
lesions, as a control. Total area of Adductores and Gracilis muscles was determined to<br>
investigate the impact of ischemia on muscle volume. Number of SMA+ arterioles was<br>
determined for the total muscle area. For both parameters, the ratio ischemic/non-<br>
ischemic values was then calculated. All procedures were performed by an investigator<br>
blinded to the treatment<br>
Example 7: Expression of FGF-1 after NV1FGF gene transfer in ischemic muscles<br>
In experiment 2, 14 days after saline injection or NV1FGF gene transfer (ie., 28<br>
days after induction of ischemia), muscles from the back part of the thigh (Gracilis and<br>
Adductores) from non-ischemic and ischemic limbs were processed as follows. FGF-1<br>
immunohistochemistry was performed using a classical streptavidin-biotin assay used to<br>
detect FGF1 expression. The incubation with a primary polyclonal anti-FGF-1 rabbit<br>
antibody (reference AB-32-NA, 1:30 dilution, R&amp;D Systems, Abingdon, UK) was<br>
followed by incubation with a biotinilated donkey anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (1:200<br>
dilution, Amcrsham, Buckinghamshire, UK). The immune complexes were localized<br>
using a chromogenic diaminobenzidine substrate, after adding peroxidase coupled to<br>
streptavidine. The 5-um thick sections were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated<br>
and mounted with permanent mounting media, lmmunoreactive fibers were identified<br>
(brown staining) under a microscope (Axioplan 2, Zeiss, Hallbergmoos, Germany).<br>
Statistical analysis<br>
Results are expressed as mean SD. Statistical significance was assumed at<br>
p
In experiment 1, serum lipid levels in groups HC/21 and HC/28 were compared at<br>
the various timepoints by ANOVA followed by Tukey-Kramer post-test for comparison<br>
between any 2 values. Angiograpbic scores calculated in groups LC, HC/21 and HC/28<br>
were compared by ANOVA followed by Tukey-Kramer post-test Non-ischemic and<br>
ischemic values of muscle area and number of SMA positive anterioles, as well as<br>
corresponding ratios, were compared by unpaired t-test in groups HC/21 and HC/28.<br>
In experiment 2, serum lipid levels in saline and NV1FGF groups were compared<br>
at the various timepoints by ANOVA followed by Tukey-Kramer post-test for<br>
comparison between any 2 values. Angiographic scores, non-ischemic and ischemic<br>
values of muscle area and number of SMA positive arterioles, as well as corresponding<br>
ratios, were compared by unpaired t-test in saline and NV1FGF groups.<br>
Example 8: Measure of serum lipids in low cholesterol and cholesterol-rich thet<br>
Tables 1 and 2 summarize serum lipid levels in experiment J and experiment 2,<br>
respectively, before cholesterol-rich thet was given (day -35) and at the various<br>
timepoints following thet modification (days -7 and +21 or +28). Cholesterol-rich diet<br>
led to a time-dependent increase both in total cholesterol and triglyceride serum levels.<br>
Example 9: Effect of cholesterol-rich thet on collateral development and arteriolar<br>
density after hindlimb ischemia (Experiment 1)<br>
As illustrated in Figures 3, collateral formation 28 days after hindlimb ischemia<br>
was high in LC group (Fig. 3 A), leading to angiographic score of 0.93 ± 0.45 (Fig. 3D).<br>
Conversely, in both HC groups formation of collaterals was dramatically impaired<br>
21 or 28 days after hindlimb ischemia with angiographic scores decreased to 0.35 ± 0.38<br>
and 0.37 ±021, respectively (see Figures 3B and 3C&gt;. Decrease in angiographic score<br>
was significant in both HC groups compared to LC group (PO.01). Nevertheless,<br>
angiographic scores were not different between HC/21 and HC/28 groups (P&gt;0.05) as<br>
illustrated in Figure 3D.<br>
Figures 4A-4D display representative cross-section at magnification X100,<br>

Graeilis ) harvested at day 21 or day 28 after induction of ischemia and quantification of<br>

significance in the intermediate steps of calculation of arteriolar density, density itself<br>
was not different 21 and 28 days after initiation of thet modification. Muscle area, SMA+<br>
arterioles and arteriolar density expressed as ratios ischemic/non-ischemic limb were not<br>
different on days 21 and 28.<br>
These results clearly demonstrate that hypercholesterolemia induces an inhibition<br>
of the development of collateral vessels, and a chronic angiogenic disorder both at the<br>
macro- and microvascular levels, as quantified by angiography, and of 
quantified by histological methods to the same extend, 21 and 28 days after hindlimb<br>
ischemia (Figures 2B and 2C),<br>
In addition, hypercholesterolemic hamsters used in this Study provide a<br>
particularly severe model, as the lipid overload applied to our model is elevated and<br>
clearly results in endothelial dysfunction and defect in angiogenesis response after<br>
hindlimb ischemia. In addition histopathological analysis of arteries harvested from<br>
hamsters 4 weeks after initiation of the cholesterol-rich thet revealed me presence of<br>
foam cells. Furthermore, there is a continuous increase in the total cholesterol and<br>
triglycerides levels lasting during the period of recovery from hindlimb ischemia,<br>
thereby placing the model is the worst case scenario in terms of severity of the<br>
endothelial impairment and angiogenesis defects.<br>
Example 10: Effect of NV1FGF gene transfer on collateral development and<br>
arteriolar density 14 days after intramuscular administration (i.e., 28 days after<br>
hindlimb ischemia) in hypercholesterolemic hamsters (Experiment 2)<br>
As indicated in Figure 5B, intramuscular NVlFGF gene transfer 14 days after<br>
induction of hindlimb ischemia greatly improved collateral formation in the ischemic<br>
limb, when compared with saline-treated hamsters (Figure 5A), Also, angiographic score<br>
after NV1FGF geae transfer (0.75 ± 0.47) was indeed significantly higher (P
that of saline-treated hamsters (022 ± 0.05).<br>

depicting mature vessels labeled by smooth muscle a-actin (SMA)<br>
immunohistochemistry from ischcmic muscles of hamsters treated with saline and<br>
NV1FGF and quantification of muscle area and 
A decreased area of Adductores and Gracilis muscles in the ischemic limb was<br>
observed in both saline and NV1FGP groups (P=0.2404 and P=0.0846, respectively). As<br>
indicated in Figures 6C and 6D, muscle area expressed as ratio ischemic/non-ischemic<br>
limb was similar in saline and NV1FGF groups (p=.4584). The number of 
arterioles decreased significantly in the ischemic limb compared to the non-ischemic limb<br>
(P=0.0333) in saline-treated animals, whereas the difference was not significant in<br>
NV1FGF group (P=0.1347). Calculation of the ratio ischemic/non-ischemic limb<br>
revealed a statistically higher value in NVlFGF-treatcd muscles compared to saline<br>
(P=0.0187). Nevertheless, arteriolar density was not different in muscles from non-<br>
ischemic and ischemic limbs of either treatment group (P=0.9320 and P=0.1586 for<br>
saline and NV1FGF, respectively). Axteriolar density expressed as the ratio<br>
ischemic/non-ischemic limb was not different between saline and NV1FGF groups (P=<br>
02724).<br>
Example 11: Expression of FGF-1 in ischemic muscles after NV1FGF gene transfer<br>
In contrast with gene therapy involving other angiogenic fectors, such as VEGF<br>
or FGF-2, the inventors have evidenced that the expression of FGF-1 was advantageously<br>
restricted to the ischemic muscles of animals treated with NV1FGF.<br>
Also, as shown by representative pictures (magnification X100) of<br>
immunohistochemical staining with an anti-FGF-1 polydonal antibody in muscles from<br>
the back part of the thigh (Gracilis and Adductores) from non-ischemic (controlateral)<br>
non injected limbs (Figure 7A) and ischemic limbs injected with saline (Figure 7B) or<br>
with NV1FGF (in Figure 7C), the expression of FGF-1 could surprisingly be detected<br>
neither in the ischemic muscles of saline-treated animals, nor in non-ischemic<br>
(controlateral) muscles of saline and NV1FGF-treated animals. This clearly shows the<br>
superior properties of the plasmid NV1FGF which allows a slow release of the encoded<br>
FGF-1 protein within a therapeutic window sufficient to effect a sustained angiogenic<br>
response via the formation of mature blood vessels, but at a concentration which does not<br>
permit dissemination and promiscuous angiogenesis or negative side effects. NV1FGF<br>
was thus proved to be particularly potent, as being capable of efficiently promoting<br>
angiogenesis at a non-detectable concentration in treated muscles, thus allowing use of<br>
concentrations of NV1FGF comprised within a therapeutic window and in conditions<br>
characterized by aggravated endothelial dysfunctions. Due to such superior<br>
characteristics in terms of safety and potency, the NV1FGF may advantageously be used<br>
as angiogeaesis therapy in aggravated conditions caused by hypercholesterolemia or<br>
diabetes.<br>
These results clearly demonstrate that NV1FGF gene therapy is capable of<br>
rescuing impaired by an increase of collateral vessels and arterioles. In effect, the growth<br>
of &gt;150µm collateral vessels has been evidenced angiographically and the growth of<br>
thigh, which comprises Biceps femoris, Adductores, Gradlis, Semimembranosus, and<br>
Semtiendtnosus muscles. Unexpectedly, the Applicant has demonstrated that formation of<br>
collateral vessels was significantly stimulated into this region, 14 days after NV1FGF<br>
gene transfer, as emphasized by angiographic score (Fig. 5C).<br>
Though no in situ measurements of tissue oxygenation have been performed to<br>
assert that ischemia occurred in that region after femoral artery excision, the presence of<br>
bistological lesions such as centronucleation, dystrophy, necrosis and inflammation was<br>
revealed (Fig. 2). More precisely, these lesions were restricted to Adductores and Gradlis<br>
muscles whereas Biceps femoris, Semimembranosus, and Semitendinosus muscles were<br>
not prone to lesions. Quantification of 
exclusively in Adductores and Gradlis muscles, just above the adductor canal. As<br>
demonstrated in Fig. 6D, NV1FGF gene transfer increased the absolute number of<br>
arterioles into these muscles of the ischemic limb.<br>
These data thus unambiguously demonstrate the ability of NV1FGF to induce the<br>
formation of mature large conductance vessels (&gt;150µm collateral vessels) and small<br>
resistance arteries (
the thigh, which are required to convey and to deliver blood to tissues.<br>
Example 12: Absence of VEGF-A induction in NV1FGF treated muscles<br>
The purpose of this experiment was to assess in vivo VEGF-A induction<br>
following intramuscular (IM) administration of naked DNA encoding rat FGF-1 in mice.<br>
Both murine VEGF-A (mVEGF-A) circulating levels and local gene expression were<br>
investigated. The circulating levels were measured by ELIS A 3 and 7 days following IM<br>
dosing, and local mVEGF-A gene expression was investigated by day 7 using two<br>
assays: immunohistochemistry (IHC) against the protein and detection of mKNA by<br>
Real-Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR).<br>
Fourty female mice were used in this study. The groups 1 to 3 (n = 8 per group)<br>
received IM administrations of pCOR-CMV.rat-spFGF-1, pC0R-CMVJ3mpry (without<br>
FGF-1 gene) or NaCl 0.9% respectively, in both right and left Tibialis Cranialis muscles.<br>
The pCOR-CMVl.rat-spFGF-1 corresponds to the NV1FGF plasmid -wherein the human<br>
FGF-1 was replaced by the corresponding rat-originated coding sequence. The injected<br>
muscles were harvested on day 7 following dosing and were processed for mVEGF-A<br>
and FGF-1 immunohistochemistry (right muscles) or mVEGF-A Real-Time RT-PCR<br>
(left muscles). In groups 1 to 3, blood was collected on day 3 (D3) and day 7 (D7) post-<br>
dosing for ELISA detection of mVEGF-A in freshly prepared serum samples.<br>
As shown in Figure 8, no FGF-1 positive myofibers were detected in pCOR-<br>
CMVEmpty I(Figure 8B) nor NaCl injected muscles (Figure 8C). A mean of 25 FGF-1<br>
expressing myofibers/section was established for pCOR-CMV.sp-ratFGF-1 injected<br>
muscles (Fig 8E).<br>
Using immunohistochemistry, a similar and faint labeling of mVEGF-A was<br>
observed in both groups of control muscles (NaCl and pCOR-CMV.Empty), radicating<br>
endogenous expression of mVEGF-A. The immunostaining, localized within the<br>
myofibers, displayed a mosaic pattern, as some fibers were more intensely labeled than<br>
others. In muscles injected with pCOR-CMV.rat-spFGF-1, no increase of mVEGF-A<br>
immunolabeling was observed by D7 post-dosing (Fig 8D) when compared to pCOR-<br>
CMV2mpty or NaCl injected muscles. The same mosaic pattern of immunostaining was<br>
observed.<br>
Using Real-Time RT-PCR technology, similar levels of mVEGF-A mRNA<br>
expression were evidenced in pCOR-CMV.Empty and NaCl treated muscles (6.84x103<br>
and 4.31X103 cDNA copies per 2 ng of total RNA), indicating endogenous mVEGF-A<br>
expression. In pCOR-CMV,sp-ratFGF-l injected muscles, no increase in mVEGF-A<br>
mRNA level (6.51 103 cDNA copies per 2 ng of total RNA) was observed by D7 post-<br>
dosing, when compared to pCOR-CMV. Empty or NaCl injected muscles.<br>
' These results clearly indicate that intramuscular administration of pCOR-<br>
CMV.tat-spFGF-1 did not lead to local mVEGF-A induction in injected muscles and did<br>
not lead to mVEGF-A secretion in the circulating blood of the injected mice.<br>
Example 13: Hypercholesterolemic Watanabe rabbit coronary artery disease<br>
animal model<br>
The validation of a gene therapy product as a potential treatment partly stands on<br>
its biological activity. In order to assess it, the animal model of choice should be as close<br>
as possible to the human disease it mimics as far as anatomy and function are concerned.<br>
The anatomical relevance was biased on the species used, which should be as close<br>
as possible to the human heart, as far as the coronary network is concerned. Moreover,<br>
the bigger species the better, as it eased the various technical steps. On the other hand,<br>
factors like the cost, handling facility, animal status contingency, and animal facility<br>
compliance was addressed. The best compromise found in the present study is the rabbit,<br>
small enough to be easily handled and stabulated, and big enough to allow a good<br>
spotting of a particular artery, a precise coronarography, and a human-like comparison of<br>
various anatomical and functional issues.<br>
Indeed, me functional relevance was here based on the ability of the animal to<br>
develop pathology as close as possible to its human counterpart, ie. angiogenic defects<br>
associated with hypercholesterolemia.<br>
Hypercholesterolemia in humans causes a vascular endothelial dysfunction and<br>
ultimately a progressive narrowing of the main coronary arteries. The unbalance in the<br>
coronary blood flow at rest and during stress creates a furtive malfunction of the<br>
myocardium that leads to pain and hypocontractility. Usually the supplies are appropriate<br>
at rest, but when stress occurs; the needs increase while the supplies cannot, due to the<br>
coronary obstructive lesions. This is the reason why the purpose of mimicking this<br>
human pathology, leads to both the setup of a stenosis ona major coronary artery and the<br>
use of a stress test to reveal the unbalance created at stress by this stenosis.<br>
Watanabe Heritable Hyperlipidemic Rabbits (WHHR) which lack of LDL<br>
receptor, therefore developing a spontaneous atherosclerosis that leads to coronary<br>
atheroma were thus used to assess ischemia and evaluate the effect on their ischemic<br>
status of intramyocardial injections of NV1FGF during open chest surgery.<br>
All experiments were conducted in accordance with a protocol approved by the<br>
Animal Care and Use Committee and conform to the NIH Guidelines for the Use and<br>
Care of Laboratory Animals.<br>
WHH one-year-old rabbits weighing 3000 to 3500g were obtained from Covance<br>
(PO Box 7200, Denver, PA, 17517, USA).<br>
All the animals were kept in our animal quarters according to good animal care<br>
practices for at least eight days preceding their utilization. Throughout this period, they<br>
were housed one per cage, had free access to food (112C type from UAR) and<br>
appropriately filtered drinking water. The animal house was maintained on a 12-h<br>
light/dark cycle (lights on at 6 a.m.) with an ambient temperature of 20-24 °C and<br>
humidity set at 35-75%.<br>
Watanabe rabbits had cholesterol levels 7 to 10 times higher than the wild type<br>
animals, while their triglycerides levels were 4 to 5 times higher than normal.<br>
After sacrifice, four of them underwent an Oil Red O staining which evidences the<br>
presence of lipid plaques in the aorta, the coronary ostia and the mitral valves.<br>
Furthermore, one of those was submitted to histological analysis. Microscopic<br>
examination of HES stained sections of the circumflex coronary artery identified an<br>
atherosclerotic plaque covering about of 15 % of the lumen in one of the two stuthed<br>
rabbit (Rabbit #CAD98R2, see Figure 9B).<br>
The Watanabe Heritable Hyperlipidemic Rabbit possessed two interesting<br>
properties: the size of its heart was well adapted to multiple intramyocardial injections,<br>
and its coronary network was studded with atherosclerotic plaques. The latest explained<br>
why the coronary blood flow is normal at rest (as assessed by a normal ECG and a<br>
normal contractility), while a dobutamin stress test under anesthesia lead to a marked<br>
pattern of ischemia.<br>
In fact, both analysis, e.g., electrocardiography and echocardiography, evidences<br>
at stress signs that can be compared to their human counterparts, for example ST<br>
depression or hypokinesis.<br>
Exanple 14: Surgery<br>
Surgery was used to deliver the gene therapy product into the myocardium by<br>
direct injection. The surgical procedure was performed under sterile conditions. The<br>
animals were anesthetized with an intramuscular injection (1 ml/Kg) of a mixture of<br>
ketamine (70mg/Kg) + Xylazine (7mg/Kg). After the animals were shaved, they were<br>
vaporized with Lidocaine 5% spray in the throat to make easier the endotracheal<br>
intubation, and the anesthesia was maintained throughout the experiment with a<br>
mechanical ventilator (Siemens, Servo Ventilator 900D) with the following conditions:<br>
&gt; Insufflation volume: l,4L/min<br>
&gt; Breathing frequency: 40/min<br>
&gt; Halothane:0.4 to 0.6%<br>
&gt; Oxygen: 30-35%<br>
A cannulation of the marginal car vein was done so that the animal is<br>
continuously perfused with 5% of glucose. A monitoring by ECG was used to ensure a<br>
stable rhythm throughout the surgical act. A left thoracotomy was performed on the<br>
fourth intercostal space. After the opening of the pericardium, the heart was exposed for<br>
plasmid injection.<br>
The injections were made on 13 different locations on the free wall of the left<br>
ventricle with a homemade needle: 250ul Hamilton syringe connected to a Steriflex G19<br>
catheter (ref: 167.10) fixed with a short bevel needle BD (26G3/8). We injected 25ul per<br>
location of a 1mg/ml solution of plasmid. Figure 1A show the location of each injection.<br>
After the injections, a drainage tube was placed in the thoracic cavity and the ribs<br>
were put side by side with two Mersurtures® (1.0) threads. The Halothane was stopped<br>
and oxygen was maintained until the wakening of the animal. The drainage was set<br>
around 200-400 mbar throughout the closing of the thorax. Two layers of muscles were<br>
closed with a Vicryl® (4.0) thread. The skin was then stitched with a Suturamide (2/0)<br>
thread. When the last stitch was done and before removal of the draining tube, the end<br>
expiration positive pressure (PEEP) was increased in the lungs with the help of the<br>
mechanical ventilator so that the lungs were well inflated throughout the thorax just<br>
before the draining tube was pulled out,<br>
A betadine gel was applied and a bandage was dressed on the wound. When the<br>
animal woke up the mechanical ventilator was stopped.<br>
Example 15: Post-surgery treatment<br>
As soon as the animal was awake, the following compounds have been injected;<br>
- an anti-aggregate and an anti-coagulate to avoid potential thrombosis of the<br>
coronary artery during and after the surgery:<br>
0.375 ml of Vetalgine (one day before surgery and then during 5 days):<br>
intramuscular<br>
0.1 ml heparin (for 4 days from next day of surgery): subcutaneous<br>
an antibiotic with a large spectrum to prevent any infections:<br>
0.2 ml of Baytril 2% (for 5 days): subcutaneous<br>
- a strong analgesic so that the animal withstands the heavy surgical act:<br>
0.5 ml of morphine (for 2 days): subcutaneous<br>
Example 16: Electrocardiography<br>
Electrocardiography was set up as close as possible to its human counterpart. Four<br>
electrodes were set on the four limbs, and six (V1 to V6) were set on the precordium. A<br>
classical 12 lead ECG was recorded on a HP Pagewriter It 4565A. The use of the ECG<br>
follows enabled to monitor (1) the cardiac rhythm during the surgery, (2) the cardiac<br>
rhythm during dobutamin stress test, (3) the detection of myocardial infarction, and (4)<br>
the detection of the signs of ischemia.<br>
4.1 Monitoring of cardiac rhythm during the surgery<br>
An open chest surgery with total anesthesia could potentially lead to various per-<br>
operatory problems that can be detected by ECG monitoring. Bradycardia was treated by<br>
atropin injection, arythmia by Lidocaine 0,5% injection (0.5 to 1ml), and cardiac arrest<br>
by energic cardiopulmonary resuscitation including Isoprenaline.<br>
4.2 Monitoring of the cardiac rhythm during the dobutamin stress test<br>
Even if the main pharmacological effect of dobutamin was its action on inotropy,<br>
this product also seemed chronotropic, and the increase in cardiac rhythm thus appeared<br>
the easiest way to monitor the stress test<br>
4.3 Detection of myocardial infarction<br>
Cardiac electric activity was recorded as a series of beats, each of them being a<br>
succession of waves: p, q, r,s and t, for the most important part The p wave was used as a<br>
witness of the atrial activity, the qrs complex the ventricular activity, and the t wave was<br>
used as a marker of repolarization.<br>
The most classical ECG sign of myocardial infarction in humans is a deep and<br>
large q wave. The parallel could be done with rabbits, as the analysis of an exploratory<br>
series of rabbits showed the presence of such a q wave in most of them when they<br>
underwent a mechanical closure of a coronary artery.<br>
4.4 Detection of signs of ischemia<br>
This furtive phenomenon was usually not seen at rest During a stress test various<br>
modifications were described. We took the assumption that a rabbit heart showed the<br>
same electrical pattern when it undergoes the same mechanical / chemical stress. In fact,<br>
a real ischemia in humans leads to an ST-segment elevation or depression, or / and<br>
inversion of the T wave (Figure 10). The two main signs are the ST-segment depression<br>
and the negative deep T wave, as shown in Figure 10 during a human stress test An<br>
example of its rabbit counterpart was showed in Figures 11.<br>
The method of scoring signs of ischemia was shown in Figure 12. A score from 0<br>
(normal ECG) to 3 points (significant ischemia) for each lead as shown in Figure 12 was<br>
given and recorded. The presence of a significant deviation in any lead was as important<br>
as the number of leads where the deviation was found. Therefore, at first the sum of all<br>
scores was recorded, then only the highest score found on a particular ECG was kept and<br>
used for the inclusion of ischemic animals. The only exclusion criteria was the presence<br>
of a q wave (larger than 1 square and deeper than 3 squares) indicating a transmural<br>
necrosis.<br>
A typical normal 12 lead ECG at rest was displayed in Figure 13A, while the<br>
same animal at maximum stress (see Figure 13B) showed a significant downsloping<br>
depression in lead I, II, aVF, V1, V2, V3, V4, and a non significant depression in lead HI,<br>
V5 and V6. This particular ECG showed a very strong ischemia.<br>
In conclusion, the ECG was the best first line method to detect either an exclusion<br>
criteria (i.e. necrosis), or an inclusion criteria (ischemic response to dobutamin).<br>
Example 17: Echocardiography<br>
An Acuson Sequoia 256 and a linear 8L5 8MHz probe was used to assess the<br>
myocardium contractility, as the small size of the rabbit thoracic area allowed using this<br>
superficial probe in this particular analysis.<br>
For each animal, once before the surgery, then every week before and during the<br>
stress test, an echocardiography was performed. In each case, the overall kinetic behavior<br>
of the heart was examined, as many segments as possible one after the other, in both long<br>
axis and short axis. Then in long axis the largest diameter was spotted, and the apparatus<br>
was switched in M mode to ensure a normal behavior of the left ventricle.<br>
A similar 2D analysis was performed at each step of the stress test. Any detected<br>
abnormality was recorded and further evaluated: the location was noted by using the<br>
nomenclature below (Figure 14), and the type of defect was rated: 1 for normal, 2 for<br>
hypokinesy, 3 for akinesy, 4 for dyskinesy. When there was a doubt on the presence of a<br>
defect, the thickening fraction was rated using M mode. A sequence was thereafter scored<br>
as 1 if all the segments have a normal thickening fraction (above 30%), 2 if hypokinetic<br>
(one or more segments under 30%), 3 if akinetic (at least one segment with no<br>
thickening), or 4 if dyskmetic (one segment with negative thickening fraction, ie. the<br>
myocardium expends during the systole).<br>
Only the highest defect score was kept for the final analysis.<br>
Example 18: Dobutamin stress test<br>
This test used dobutamin for its inotropic and chronotropic properties in order to<br>
mimic the cardiac response to stress conditions. As ischemia Is a furtive phenomenon that<br>
usually occurs during a stress, its unveiling was detected by an electric signature on the<br>
ECG and its consequences on myocardial contractility, as evidenced by<br>
echocardiogcaphy. The technical steps of the test are as follows.<br>
- Anesthesia : Isoflurane was discarded as it leads to high heart rate at rest<br>
Halothane was discarded as the addition of atropin lead to the appearance of ventricular<br>
ectopies. Xylazinc-Ketamine was therefore chosen, as the kinetics of the heart rate<br>
increase was good.<br>
- Atropin: 0.5 mg/Kg of atropin methyl nitrate were injected in the ear catheter as<br>
a preliminary step. Atropin sulfate was discarded at it lead to some degree of heart rate<br>
increase.<br>
- Scale up of the doses: The first dose was 2 µg/Kg/min. Every three minutes the<br>
dose was increased to 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 ug/kg/min. If the maximal heart was not<br>
reached, a final dose of 80 µg/Kg/min was used.<br>
ECO and echocardiography were recorded at every step. The heart rate of an<br>
anesthetized rabbit at rest was 203 ± 22 (n=61 tests), 280 ± 31 (n=59) at 40 ug/kg/min,<br>
and 299 ± 19 (n=29) at 80 µg/kg/min. The decision to go from 40 to 80 was taken only if<br>
the heart rate was below 300 bpm at 40 µg/kg/min.<br>
In conclusion, this test was used to enlighten the behavior of the myocardium<br>
during a chemical stress, therefore unveiling an ischemic section of the heart<br>
Example 19: Histological analysis - Detection of the atherosclerotic plaques,<br>
tolerance and FGF-1 expression<br>
The circonflex coronary artery of two rabbits was examined for the presence of<br>
atherosclerotic plaques at the end of the experiment The hearts were removed and a<br>
sample of the left ventricle containing the upper part of the circumflex coronary artery<br>
was dissected and dipped in PBS buffered 3.7% formalin for further analysis. Each<br>
sample was embedded in paraffin. 5 µm sections were performed each 300 µm and<br>
stained with Hematoxilin-Eosin-Saffron (HES) for microscopic examination.<br>
Two others rabbits were used to assess the efficiency and safety of a FGF-1<br>
coding plasmid injection in the left ventricular wall. The latest were euthanized at day 3,<br>
the heart was removed and washed, and the anterior wall was observed and kept in<br>
formalin for one hour. Then it was divided in five samples, each of them fixed overnight<br>
in 3.7% PBS-buffered formalin before to be embedded in paraffin.<br>
For each heart, 5 samples presenting macroscopic lesions or supposed to contain<br>
injection sites were collected and fixed overnight in 3.7% PBS-buffered formalin before<br>
to be embedded in paraffin.<br>
A standardized procedure was used for slide preparation. Two 5-µm serial<br>
sections were performed from each block. One section was stained with Hematoxylin-<br>
Eosin-Saffron (HES) for histopathological examination; the other section was processed<br>
for FGF-1 immunohistochemistry (IHC). Injection sites were identified on HES stained<br>
sections by the presence of histological changes related to needle and vector injection.<br>
The IHC procedure was done using a classical streptavidin-biotin assay. The incubation<br>
with a primary polyclonal anti-FGF-1 rabbit antibody (R&amp;D Systems; # AB-32-NA, 1:30<br>
dilution) was followed by incubation with a biotinilated donkey anti-rabbit<br>
immunoglobulin (Amersham, 1:200 dilution). The immune complexes were localized<br>
using a chromogenic diaminobenzidine substrate, after adding peroxydase coupled to<br>
streptavidine. The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated and<br>
mounted with permanent mounting media. With this method, immunoreactive fibers<br>
appeared brown and the nuclei blue. Previous validation of FGF-1 IHC assay in rabbit<br>
muscle demonstrated the ability to detect FGF-1 transgene in myofibers, even when using<br>
anti-rabbit secondary antibothes on rabbit tissue samples. Negative control (omitting the<br>
primary antibody, but using the secondary antibody) was used to discriminate non-<br>
specific staining (mainly extracellular) to specific immunoreactrvity. Moreover, the<br>
performances of FGF-1 IHC were controlled throughout the assay by using a positive<br>
section from a rat muscle having previously demonstrated a high level of FGF-1<br>
expression (slide P1056GNR2, study PAD31.2001). The immunoreactive fibers were<br>
identified and counted under a microscope (Zeiss, Axioplan 2). The number of<br>
immunoreactive cells given was the number of immunoreactive cardiomyofibers<br>
observed around each injection site.<br>
Example 20: Demonstration of therapeutic angiogenesis in hypercholesterolemic<br>
settings<br>
A total of 16 Watanabe one-year-old male rabbits were used to assess the efficacy<br>
of NV1FGF on reversing myocardial ischemia associated with hypercholesterolemia. In<br>
addition, two New Zealand rabbits underwent the same surgical procedure and they were<br>
sacrificed at day 3 for the expression analysis.<br>
20.1/ FGF-1 expression assessment and histopathological pattern<br>
Two healthy New Zealand rabbits were sacrificed three days after the surgical<br>
procedure and the injection of NV1FGF. The evaluation of histopathological changes<br>
relative to the vector injection was successfully achieved, as 5 and 7 injection sites were<br>
localized within the 5 samples analyzed from each heart Some samples evidenced up to<br>
3 distinct injection sites, separated by 6 to 10 mm, corresponding to the distance between<br>
2 injections. The myocardial lesions were more or less linear and consisted in<br>
degeneration and necrosis with active chronic inflammatory response (see Figure 15A).<br>
Some samples displayed diffuse infiltration of lymphocytes below the pericardium,<br>
suggesting a limited pericarditis. Individual results are shown in table 3.<br>
Three days after an intramyocardial injection of NV1FGF, FGF-1<br>
hnmunoreactive myofibers were detected in all the samples displaying injection sites.<br>
The expression, restricted to the periphery of the histological lesions, varied from 3 to 36<br>
positive cardiomyofibers per injection site (see Figure 15B). Individual results were<br>
indicated in the table 3.<br>
Table 3: Histological observations and FGF-1 expression in healthy rabbit myocardium,<br>
3 days after intramyocardial injections of NV1FGF<br>
In conclusion, three days after direct injections of NV1FGF within healthy rabbit<br>
myocardium, myofibers degeneration and subsequent inflammatory reaction were<br>
observed. At such carry time points, histological damages were considered as non<br>
5 specific of NV1FGF, as the severity and the type of the lesions were similar to the one<br>
observed in pig myocardium following injection of naked DNA plasmid not encoding for<br>
any transgene.<br>
The efficiency of transgene expression in rabbit heart was established for<br>
intramyocardial injections of NV1FGF as FGF-1 expression was found in all the samples<br>
10 displaying an injection site. Taking into account the number of immunoreactive<br>
myofibers per injection site, the level of expression was similar to the one observed after<br>
intramyocardial injection of a same amount of NVlFGF in rat heart, assuming that one<br>
injection site in rabbit equals a single injection in rat heart<br>
15 20.2/ Electrocardiographic pattern of the injected Watanabe rabbits<br>
16 rabbits were included in this study. Every animal underwent the stress test<br>
before the surgery and then every week for four weeks. The highest score observed was<br>
plotted for both groups (blue for empty plasmid injected animals, pink for NVlFGF<br>
injected animals). As soon as day seven, most of the animals of the NV1FGF group got a<br>
20 lower score, indicating that the ischemia tends to disappear under treatment. On the other<br>
hand, most of the animals in the empty treated group remained deeply ischemic<br>
(maximum ischemic score of 3).<br>
The results as presented in Figure 16 showed the evolution of the maximum ECG<br>
score during the stress test on rabbits treated with empty plasmid (blue dots for<br>
25 individuals, blue column for the mean) or NV1 -FGF plasmids (red dots for individuals,<br>
pink column for the mean). Treatment of NVlFGF plasmid clearly showed a significant<br>
efficacious decrease of the ischemic size.<br>
Starting with day 7, a statistical analysis (unpaired t-test) showed a significant<br>
difference between both groups (p
30 presence of FGF-1 in the regression of the ischemic electrocardiographic pattern at stress.<br>
203/Echocardiographic pattern of the injected Watanabe rabbits<br>
A first step was to validate the accuracy of the correspondence between a<br>
qualitative evaluation (classification normal, hypokinesis, akinesis) and the quantitative<br>
analysis (fractional wall thickening). 30 segments were analysed, 16 as seen as normal<br>
and 14 as abnormal. Their fractional wall thickening was thereafter calculated, and the<br>
correspondence was shown in Figure 17.<br>
As can be seen, the overlap between the two series is very narrow, indicating that<br>
the visual evaluation was quite adequate. The abnormal segments included one dyskinetic<br>
segment (good thickening fraction but abnormal move) and three akinetic segments, of<br>
which one even got thinner during the systole. Subsequently our qualification were<br>
considered valid as normal and hypokinetic / akinetic, thus enabling a second and wider<br>
evaluation of the myocardial kinetic.<br>
A second step was to correlate the ECG result with the echocardiographic<br>
evaluation in each stress test The result was plotted on Figure 18. The regression curve<br>
was shown in red, indicating that an abnormal ECG was roughly correlated with an<br>
abnormal echo. The two shaded areas represented the two main sets of data: the first is<br>
the normokinesis echo and normal / slightly ischemic ECG, and the second was the<br>
abnormal echo (hypokinesis and akinesis) and the very ischemic ECG (score 3).<br>
The six points where an ischemic ECG corresponded to a normal echo were due<br>
to the technical difficulty of getting a good clip for every test, indicating probably that<br>
defects on echo were missed. On the other hand, only three tests showed a slightly<br>
ischemic ECG with an echo defect No normal ECG was correlated with an abnormal<br>
echo, indicating a good sensitivity for the ECG.<br>
In a third step, evolution of echocardiography in two groups of four treated<br>
animals was followed. The score was rated as 1 (normal), 2 (hypokinetic) or 3 (akinetic).<br>
No dyskinetic segment was observed in this set of animals. The raw data were plotted in<br>
Table 4 As can be seen in this annexe, the baseline values were different (mean of 2.25<br>
versus 1.5). Therefore, the whole set was normalized by using each baseline value as<br>
100%. Then, the following points for each animal were expressed as a percentage of this<br>
baseline. The final figure was displayed in Figure 19.<br>
5 The NV1FGF treated animals score was significantly lower than the empty<br>
plasmid treated animals score (analysis performed by unpaired t-test), indicating an effect<br>
of the presence of FGF-1 on the myocardium contractility, while the empty plasmid<br>
treated animals score increases.<br>
Of note, as the final sacrifice step included other technical analysis was not<br>
10 detailed here, no echo recording was available for these annuals at day 28.<br>
The results as presented in Figure 19 clearly showed that treated animals with<br>
multiple NV1FGF injections in the myocardium lead to a regression of the ischemia<br>
pattern at stress both in ECG and echocardiography, while the empty plasmid injection<br>
did not These results also clearly showed that NV1FGF effects helped the heart to adapt<br>
15 to stress conditions in hypercholesteromic settings.<br>
Example 21: Demonstration of the induction of arterioles in NV1FGF treated<br>
cardiac muscle<br>
20 21.1/ Animals<br>
Mult male mini-swine (30kg) were used for the study. A total of 34 animals (n=8<br>
final expected in each treated and control groups, 4 group total) were used. Animals were<br>
housed under standard conditions and fed a regular thet. The Animal Care and Use<br>
Committee of Duke University approved all procedures and protocols. Animals received<br>
humane care in compliance with the "Principles of Laboratory Animal Care" formulated<br>
by the National Society for Medical Research and the "Guide for the Care and Use of<br>
Laboratory Animals" prepared by the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources and<br>
published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH publication 85-23, revised 1985).<br>
Animals underwent anesthesia and orotracheal intubation. Continuous<br>
dectrocardiographic and pulse-oximetric monitoring were used throughout the procedure<br>
to ensure a stable cardiac rhythm and oxygenation. Under sterile conditions, a left<br>
anterolateral thoracotomy was performed through the fourth intercostal space. The<br>
pericardium was isolated longitudinally, and the left atrial appendage retracted to allow<br>
exposure of the left circumflex (LCx) artery. The proximal LCx was dissected free to<br>
allow placement of a hydraulic occluder and 2 mm ultrasonic flow probe (Transonic<br>
Systems, Inc., Ithaca, NY) around the vessel. The flow probe was placed distal to the<br>
occluder to record downstream flow through the LCx. The occluder and flow probe was<br>
then exteriorized through a separate stab incision. A 20 French chest tube was placed and<br>
the wound was closed in layers. The chest tube was removed at the conclusion of the<br>
procedure. Three days postoperantively, the occluder was inflated to reduce resting blood<br>
flow in the LCx to approximately 10% of baseline as assessed using the implanted flow<br>
probe. The animals were kept in this low-flow state for two weeks with blood flow<br>
recordings being performed three times per week to assure to same degree of vascular<br>
occlusion prior to physiologic assessment<br>
21.2/ Positron emission tomography, Dobutamine stress echocardiography<br>
and Colored Microspheres<br>
After 32 ± 11 days in the low-flow state, the animals underwent positron emission<br>
tomography (PET) and dobutamine stress echocardiograpby (DSE) to characterize the<br>
blood flow, metabolic, and functional status of the heart, and document the presence of<br>
iscbemic, viable myocardium in the LCx distribution. PET scans were interpreted as<br>
showing hibernating myocardium if a flow deficit is noted in the lateral and<br>
posteroinferior walls of the left ventricle supplied by the LCx accompanied by normal or<br>
increased glucose utilization in these same regions (both as compared to the non-ischcmic<br>
septum). Using DSE, viability in the lateral and posteroinferior walls of the left ventricle<br>
was defined as an improvement in systolic wall thickening with low dose dobutamine in<br>
myocardial regions with severe hypocontractility at rest Viable segments were<br>
considered ischemic if systolic wall motion was deteriorated with stress (biphasic<br>
response).<br>
Dosing was performed after PET and DSE confirm the presence of ischemic<br>
myocardium, by direct intramyocardial injection of the FGF expression plasmid such as<br>
NV1FGF, with an open chest approach (52 ± 16 days post LCx occlusion). The vectors<br>
were administered in 10 sites (100 µg/ 100 µl/ injection site for plasmidic vectors)<br>
distributed into the free left ventricular wall. 10 injections of 100 ul of saline were<br>
performed for the control group. The treatments were performed by operators and<br>
investigators which were blinded to the treatment All efficacy parameters were assigned<br>
in a bunded manner, and the code was opened at the end of the study.<br>
109 ± 13 days after the treatment, the hearts were excised for bistologic analysis<br>
and perfusion assay. A standardized procedure was used for samples preparation as<br>
shown in Figure 20. More precisely, the hearts were sectioned in 3 short axis slices<br>
(apical, mid and basal segments). Each of these segments was subdivided in 6 (mid and<br>
basal segments) or 4 orientated sectors (apical segment) giving a total of 16 sectors per<br>
heart Each sector was then divided in 3 transmural samples; one sample was stored for<br>
microsphere perfusion analysis, another was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen-cooled<br>
isopentane while the latter sample was fixed in 3.7% formalin. A sample from the right<br>
ventricle was collected as control.<br>
21.4/ Histological analysis<br>
A standardized procedure was used for slide preparation. Each formalin-fixed<br>
sample was embedded in paraffin wax and three 5-µm serial sections were performed<br>
from each block. One section was stained with Hematorylin-Eosin-Saffron (HES) for<br>
evaluation of post-necrotic fibrosis by histopathological examination; the serial section<br>
was stained with anti-a Smooth Muscle Actin (SMA) antibody to identify arteries and<br>
arterioles. a-SMA is indeed expressed in both pericytes and smooth muscle cells<br>
associated with endothelial cells in mature blood vessels (Benjamin et al., Development,<br>
125, 1591-1598. 1998). Of note, some large veins can be stained with this antibody, but<br>
are easily identified on morphological criteria.<br>
21.4.1/a-SMA staining<br>
All sectors from all the pigs were processed with a-SMA imrnunohistochemistry.<br>
The procedure was done using the Dako EnVisionTM+HRP (Horse Radish Peroxidase)<br>
detection system (Dako, Sabattini et al., J.Clin Patbol, 51:506-511, 1998). The sections<br>
were incubated with an anti a-SMA monoclonal antibody (Dako, clone 1A4, 1:100<br>
dilution). The second step consisted in incubation with goat anti-rabbit antibody<br>
conjugated to an HRP labeled polymer. The immune complexes were localized using the<br>
chromogenic diaminobenzidine substrate. The sections were counterstained with<br>
hematoxylin, dehydrated and mounted with permanent mounting media. With this<br>
method immunoreactive cells appeared brown and the nuclei blue.<br>
21.4.2/ Morphometric analysis<br>
The measurements were performed by a single observer blinded to the treatment<br>
regimen. For each sector, the HES-stained section was first analyzed in order to<br>
determine the scar area (post necrotic fibrosis). The amount of fibrosis in the sample was<br>
scored at low magnification (x25) using the following scale:<br>
+ : minimal (lees man 5% of the surface of the sample affected by fibrosis)<br>
++: mild (~5-15% of the surface of the sample)<br>
Evaluation of vascular density was performed on the serial a-SMA-stained<br>
section. The number of a-SMA stained vessels was counted in 9 high-power microscopic<br>
fields (037 mm2 each) located in l) the center of the scar (3 fields), ii) the border of the<br>
scar (3 fields) and iii) distant from the scar, i.e.in viable myocardium (3 fields). For each<br>
field, 3 categories of vessels were recorded: small unilayered vessels, multilayered<br>
vessels with a diameter  100 µm (see<br>
figure 2). Large veins with a a-SMA staining were excluded from the analysis, based on<br>
their morphological features. Of note, the numerous myofibroblasts containing a-SMA<br>
filaments were excluded from the morphometric analysis.<br>
The vascular density (i.e. the number of each category of vessels per mm3) was<br>
then calculated for each zone (scar, border zone, viable myocardium) by pooling data<br>
from the 5 sectors supposed to be injected (BA, BAL, MA, MAL and AA sectors). To<br>
serve as an additional control, vascular density in the non-injected zone (BIL, BI, BIS,<br>
BAS, MIL, Ml, MIS, MAS, AL, AI, AS sectors) was also calculated.<br>
21.4.3/ Transgene expression<br>
BA, BAL, MA, MAL and AA sectors from the NVlFGF-treated pigs were processed<br>
for FGF-1 immunohistochemistry. FGF-1 expression was assessed using a classical<br>
streptavidin-biotin assay. The incubation with the primary polyclonal anti-FGF-1 rabbit<br>
antibody (R&amp;D Systems; # AB-32-NA, 1:30 dilution) was followed by incubation with a<br>
biotinilated donkey anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Amersham, 1:200 dilution). The<br>
immune complexes were localized using a chromogenic diaminobenzidine substrate, after<br>
adding peroxydase coupled to streptsvidine. The sections were counterstained with<br>
hematoxylm, dehydrated and mounted with permanent mounting media. With this<br>
method, immunoreactive fibers appeared brown and the nuclei blue. The performances of<br>
the FGF-1 IHC were controlled throughout the assay by using a positive section from a<br>
rat muscle having demonstrated a high level of pCOR-CMV.ratFGF-1 plasmid gene<br>
transfer.<br>
21.4.4/ Statistical analysis<br>
Quantitative variations in vasculature were evidenced in the different zones (scar,<br>
border, viable myocardium) between saline and plasmid-treated groups, arithmetical<br>
means and standard deviation (Sd) were calculated for each category of vessels.<br>
Intergroup data were compared using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA,<br>
SigmaStat®, Jandel Scientific). When a significant difference was found, multiple<br>
comparisons versus control group were performed using the Dunnett's method. All<br>
differences were considered to be significant at a level of p=0.05.<br>
21.5/ Evaluation of the vascular density<br>
Comparisons of the means were made between the injected zone in the treated<br>
animals with NV1FGF and NaCl injected zone in the controls animals (Figure 21).<br>
Analysis was performed separately for each class of vessels (small, median, large)<br>
in the viable myocardium. Whatever the treatment group, numerous arterial structures<br>
with a diameter 
criteria only, these vessels were indistinguishable from native myocardial vessels. Most<br>
of them were small, demonstrating a single layer of smooth muscle cells.<br>
When compared to saline injected areas, the administration of NV1FGF to the<br>
heart induced, in the viable part of myocardium located within the injected zone, a 22%<br>
and 20% increase in the density of small unilayered vessels (p=0.017). This effect was<br>
not demonstrated for larger vessels.<br>
These results clearly showed that direct intramyocardial injection of a pCOR<br>
plasmid encoding either the spFGF-1 transgene induced, in ischemic pig hearts, a<br>
significant increase in the density of unilayered arteries, i.e. arterioles with a single layer<br>
of smooth muscle cells. Also, these results demonstrated a long-lasting FGF-1 expression<br>
following direct intramyocardial injection a NV1FGF. Indeed, some cardiomyofibers,<br>
always located around the injection site, expressed detectable amount of FGF-1 104 to<br>
132 days after the dosing. This long lasting expression is likely in fevor of the<br>
recruitment and division of precursor cells needed for arteriogenesis and for the<br>
maintenance of the induced new vessels. At the time of harvesting, these vessels are<br>
believed to be at an early stage of arteriogenesis.<br><br><br>
