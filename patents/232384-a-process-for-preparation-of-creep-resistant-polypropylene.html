				<td>New piping-grade polypropylene composition<br>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of rigid polypropylene for e.g. pipe, fiber, profile and moulding applications, containing from 1.0 to 10.0% by weight of ethylene repeating units and having a MFR2 value of between 0.05 and 0.40 g/10 min, by polymerizing propylene and ethylene or a C4-CiQ-a-olefin in the presence of a catalyst system, the procatalyst component of which is a reaction product of at least a tetravalent titanium compound and a magnesium halide compound and the cocatalyst component of which comprises an organoaluminium compound, and hydrogen as a molecular weight regulating agent, to give said polypropylene.<br>
The invention also relates to a process for the preparation of elastomer modified polypropylene for e.g. pipe, fiber, profile and moulding applications, containing from 1.0 to 30% by weight of ethylene or a C4-C10-α-olefin repeating units and having a MFR2 value of between 0,05 and 50 g/10 min, by polymerizing propylene and ethylene or a C4-C10-α-olefin in the presence of a catalyst system, the procatalyst component of which is a reaction product of at least a tetravalent titanium compound and a magnesium halide compound and the cocatalyst com¬ponent of which comprises an organoaluminium compound, and hydrogen as a molecular weight regulating agent, as well as providing an elastomer component, to give said elastomer modified polypropylene.<br>
Finally, the invention also relates to a creep-resistant polypropylene made by the above processes and its use-By Melt Flow Rate (MFR) is meant the weight of a polymer extruded through a standard cylindrical die at a standard temperature in a laboratory rheometer carrying a standard piston and load. Thus MFR is a measure of the melt viscosity of a polymer and hence also of its molecular weight. The smaller the MFR, the larger is the molecular weight. It is frequently used for characterizing a polyolefins, e.g. polypropylene, where the standard conditions MFRmi are: temperature 230°C; die dimensions 9.00 mm in length and 2.095 mm in diameter; load of the piston, 2,16 kg (mi=2), 5.0 kg (mi=5), 10.0 kg (mi=10), 21.6 kg (mi-21). See Alger, M.S.M., Polymer Science Dictionary, Elsevier 1990, p. 257. The standard generally used are ISO 1133 C4, ASTM D 1238 and DIN 53735.By Flow Rate Ratio (FRR) is meant the ratio between the Melt Flow Rate (MFR) measured at a standard temperature and with standard die dimensions using a heavy load and the melt flow rate measured at the same temperature with the same die dimensions using a light load. Usually, for propylene polymers are used nominal loads 10.0 kg and 2.16 kg (ISO 1133 C4). The larger the value of the FRR, the broader the molecular weight distribution.<br>
Polypropylene copolymer has many characteristics which makes it desirable for applications like pipes, fittings, moulded articles, foams etc. Polypropylene as piping material is mainly used in non-pressure applications (pipe and fittings) and profiles. There is a small volume used for pressure pipe, mainly hot water and industrial pipes. The good thermal resistance of polypropylene compared to other polyolefins is utilized for the pipe applications. All three main types of propylene polymer, i.e. homopolymers, random copolymers and block copolymers are used. Homopolymevs give the pipe good rigidity but the impact and creep properties are not very good. The block copolymers give good impact properties but the creep properties are like homopolymers due to the homoporymer matrix. Propylene ethylene random copolymers are used for pressure pipe applications for hot water and industrial pipes.<br>
The propylene-ethylene random copolymers for pressure pipes are today produced with high yield Ziegler-Natta catalysts in processes (bulk or gas phase) giving a material having a relatively narrow molecular weight distribution (MWD * Mv/Mn) of about 5, corresponding to a FRR (MFRio/MFRa) of 13-17. The molecular weight (Mw) of the pipe material with melt flow rate (MFR2) of 0.1-0.4 is about 600 000 - 1 000 000. This high molecular weight and the narrow MWD cause problems in compounding and extrusion of pipes. The proccssability of such materials is difficult due to the low shear sensitivity causing unwanted degradation of the material and melt fracture, which is seen as uneven surface and thickness variations of the pipes. In addition the conventional propylene random copolymer pipe materials produced in one phase have not strength enough for the short and long term properties (notch resistance and creep) needed for good pressure pipes.<br>
The processability of the conventional propylene random copolymers can be improved by broadening the MWD using multi-stage polymerization processes. In multi-stage polymerization the MWD of the polymer can be broadened by pro¬ducing different molecular weight polymers in each stage. The MWD of polymer becomes broader when lower molecular weight polymer is reactor-blended into the higher molecular weight polymer adjusting the final MFR by choosing the right<br>
molecular weight and the reactor split in each stage. The molecular weight of the polymer in each step can be controlled by hydrogen which acts as a chain transfer agent. Reactor temperature may be also used for controlling the molecular weight of polymer in each step. Multi-stage polymerization is disclosed e.g. in patent application JP-91048, but the process concerns film grade polypropylene with a final MFR2 of about 1.5.<br>
When the processability is improved by producing broader MWD propylene random copolymer, also the amount of low molecular fraction is increased if the comonomer feeds are the same in each stage. The taste and odour are adversely affected.<br>
By using a concept invented with high yield TiCl4 catalyst it is possible to produce pipe material having improved mechanical and pipe properties and also a good extrudability. The improved strength properties of the material come from a very high molecular weight fraction of Mw k 2000000 g/moi and totally novel comonomer distribution together with a broad molecular weight distribution, hi another embodiment of the invention, an elastomer is provided within this propylene product for increased impact strength.<br>
The embodiment of the invention relating to a non-elastomeric polypropylene product is essentially characterized by what is said in the characterizing part of claim 1. Thus the invented concept is based on the idea of producing a broad MWD and a high molecular weight propylene random copolymer and improved comonomer distribution using high yield catalysts in two or several reactors at different reaction conditions. The comonomers incorporated in long chains as described in this invention destroy the regularity of the chains leading to the more homogenous distribution of the essential tie-chains and entanglements needed for creep properties and toughness in pipe materials.<br>
The low molecular weight fraction contains no or minimal portion of ethylene repeating units in the polymer. Together with the high molecular weight random copolymer fraction this fraction is improving the processability. The no or low ethylene content fraction gives the total polymer the stiffness needed for rigid materials e.g. pipes, profiles and moulding applications.<br>
A homopolymer or a minirandom copolymer (ethylene  2% has a stiffness of 
The problem with the uneven comonomer distribution with high yield TiCl4 catalysts is solved in a way that the amount of comonomer is split between the reactors. To the reactor where the high molecular weight propylene polymer is pro¬duced is fed more essentially all, comonomer compared to the reactor where the low molecular PP i produced. Higher amounts of comonomer can be fed because the solubility of the high molecular weight polymer is lower. The final comonomer content is adjusted by controlling the comonomer feed into the reactor. The intervals given in this publication always include both limits thereof.<br>
Thus one embodiment of the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of polypropylene for e.g. pipe, fiber, profile and moulding applications. Such a grade of polypropylene has from 1.0 to 10.0% by weight of etbylene or a C4-C10-α-otefra repeating units and has a MFR2 value of between 0.10 and 0.40 g/10 min. The preparation takes place by polymerizing propylene and ethylene or a C4-C10-α-olefin in the presence of a catalyst system, the procatalyst component of which is a reaction product of at least a tetravalent titanium compound and a magnesium halide compound, and a cocatalyst component of which comprises an organoaluminium compound, optionally an external electron donor and hydrogen as a molecular weight regulating agent<br>
It has been found that extremely creep-resistant polypropylene can be prepared by applying the following steps in any mutual order:<br>
(a)	copolymerizrag propylene and ethylene or aC4-C10-α-olefin into a random<br>
copolymer at 40 to 110°C using: a catalyst system of the above-mentioned type; a<br>
portion of ethylene or C4-C10-α-olefin leading to 1,0 to 10.0% by weight of<br>
ethylene or C4-C10-α-otefin repeating units in said random copolymer; and no or a<br>
minimal amount of hydrogen leading to a MFR10 value of between 0.01 and 5.0<br>
g/10 min for said random copolymer, if this step is performed first, or to a MFR2<br>
value for said polypropylene of between 0.05 and 0.40 g/10 rain, if this step is<br>
performed after step (b); the proportion of random copolymer of this step being<br>
from 20 to 80% by weight of said polypropylene,<br>
(b)	polymerizing propylene at 40 to 110°C using: a catalyst system of the above-<br>
mentioned type; no or a minimal portion of ethylene leading to 0,0 to 1.0% by<br>
weight of ethylene repeating units in the polymer resulting from this step; and an<br>
amount of hydrogen leading U&gt; a MTR2 value of between 20 and 1000 g/10 mio fnr<br>
said polymer, if this step is performed first, or to a MFR2 value for said poly¬<br>
propylene of between 0.05 and 0.40 g/10 min, if this step is performed after step (a);<br>
the proportion of polymer of this step being from 80 to 20% by weight of said polypropylene.<br>
In step (a) a very high molecular weight random copoiymer of propylene and ethylene is prepared, which gives the polypropylene its extremely high shape-resistance, fai step (b), essentially homopolymeric low molecular weight poly¬propylene is prepared, which gives the product good melt-processing properties and improved stiffness.<br>
In the process of me invention the order of steps (a) and (b) can freely be chosen. It is, however, preferable to perform step (a) before step (b). Although, different catalyst systems of the above mentioned type can be used in steps (a) and (b), it is preferable to use the same catalyst system for both steps. According to a preferable embodiment, the catalyst system is added to step (a) and the same catalyst system is then used both in step (a) and (b).<br>
Steps (a) and (b) can be performed in reactors, which may be of any type con¬ventionally used for propylene polymerization and copolymerization, preferentially a loop (CSTR) or gas phase reactor, but it is most preferable to perform one of steps (a) and (b) in a loop (CSTR) reactor and the other step in a gas phase reactor, whereby any reaction medium used and unreactive reagents are removed at least partly between step (a) and step (b). In such a case the procatalyst (also called catalyst in the art), cocatalyst and external donor are fed to the loop reactor. The reaction medium and unreacted reagents such as H2 or comonomer can be removed by known methods between the steps.<br>
It is also preferable to adjust the proportion of copoiymer resulting from step (a) and the MFR values of step (a) and step (b) so that the FRR value (MFRio/MFR2), which is also a measure of the molecular weight distribution, of said polypropylene is between 10 and 100, most preferably between 20 and 50.<br>
The catalyst used hi the present process for the preparation of polypropylene can be any suitable catalyst, which consists of a procatalyst, which is a reaction product of at least tetravalent titanium compound and a magnesium halide compound, and a cocatalyst, which comprises an organoaluminium compound, an optionally external electron donor compound.<br>
Preferentially, said catalyst system has been prepared by:<br>
(i) providing a procatalyst by reacting a magnesium halide compound, chosen from magnesium chloride, its complex with ethanol and other derivatives of magnesium chloride, with titanium tetrachloride and optionally with an internal donor, exemplified by the dialkyl phthalates,<br>
(ii) providing as cocatalyst an organoaluminium compound chosen from trialkyl aluminium exemplified by triethyl aluminium, dialkyl aluminium chloride, alkyl aluminium sesquichloride, optionally<br>
(iii) providing as at least one external donor an ester of an aromatic acid exempli¬fied by methyl p-methyl benzoate, or an organosilicon compound exemplified by alkoxy silanes or blends thereof, and, optionally<br>
(iv) prepolymerizing a small amount of olefin by contacting the olefin with said procatalyst, cocatalyst and, optionally, the external donor.<br>
hi step (a) of the present process, a portion of ethylene is preferably used, which leads to 1.0 to 7.0% by weight of ethylene units in the random copolymer resulting from this step. Further in step (a) preferably no or a minimal amount of hydrogen is used, which leads to a MFRio value of between 0.05 and 2.0 g/min for the random copolymer resulting from mis step, if the step is performed first. Also, the proportion of random copolymer resulting from step (a) is preferably from 40 to 80% by weight of said polypropylene. Thus it can be said, that the polypropylene prepared by the process of the invention contains preferably more random copolymer than low molecular weight homopolymer or minirandom copolymer.<br>
In step (b), low molecular weight essentially homopolymeric propylene is produced. The molecular weight is adjusted by means of hydrogen. If the hydrogen amount is too high, the molecular weight will be too low and the product will be useless as pipe, profile or moulding material. In step (b) an amount of hydrogen is preferably used, which leads to a MFR2 value of between 30 and 500 g/10 min for the polymer resulting from this step, if it performed first.<br>
As it was said before, too much ethylene units in the low molecular weight component leads to difficulties in retaining good stiffness properties of the product. Thus, in step (b) no or a minimal amount of ethylene is used, which preferably leads to 0.0 to 0.5% by weight of ethylene repeating units in the polymer resulting from this step. Prefel'ably, the low molecular weight homopolymer fraction is smaller that the high molecular weight random copolymer fraction, i.e. the proportion nf polymer resulting from step (b) is from 60 to 20% by weight of said polypropylene.<br>
According to another embodiment of the present invention, the invention relates to a process for the preparation of elastomer modified polypropylene for e.g. pipe, fiber, film, foam, profile and moulding applications. Such a grade of polypropylene has from 1.0 to 30% by weight of ethylene or a C4-C10-α-olefin repeating units and has a MFR2 value of between 0.05 and 50 g/10 min. The preparation takes place by polymerizing propylene and ethylene or a C4-C10-α-olefin in the presence of a catalyst system, the procatalyst component of which is a reaction product of at least a tetravalent titanium compound and a magnesium halide compound, and a cocatalyst component of which comprises an organoaluminium compound, and hydrogen as a molecular weight regulating agent, as well as providing an elastomer component.<br>
It has been found that extremely creep-resistant polypropylene can be prepared by applying the following steps:<br>
(a)	copolymerizing propylene and ethylene into a random copolymer at 40 to<br>
110'C using: a catalyst system of the above-mentioned type; a portion of ethylene<br>
or C4-C10-α-olefin leading to 1.0 to 10.0% by weight of ethylene or C4-C10-α-<br>
olefin repeating units in said random copolymer; and no or a minimal amount of<br>
hydrogen leading to a MFR10 value of between 0.01 and 5.0 g/10 min for said<br>
random copolymer, if this step is performed first, or to a MFR2 value for said poly¬<br>
propylene of between 0.05 and 50 g/10 min, if this step is performed after step (b);<br>
the proportion of random copolymer of this step being from 20 to 80% by weight of<br>
said polypropylene,<br>
(b)	polymerizing propylene at 40 to 110°C using: a catalyst system of the above-<br>
mentioned type; no or a minimal portion of ethylene leading to 0.0 to 1.0% by<br>
weight of ethylene repeating units in the polymer resulting from this step; and an<br>
amount of hydrogen leading to a MFR2 value of between 20 and 1000 g/10 min for<br>
said polymer, if this step is performed first, or to a MFR2 value for said poly¬<br>
propylene of between 0.05 and 50 g/10 min, if this step is performed after step (a);<br>
the proportion of polymer of this step being from 80 to 20% by weight of said<br>
polypropylene, and<br>
(c)	providing a rubbery copolymer (elastomer) the proportion of which is from 5<br>
to 40% by weight of said polypropylene.<br>
In step (a) a very high molecular weight random copolymer of propylene and ethylene is prepared, which gives the polypropylene its extremely high shape-resistance. In step (b), essentially homopolymeric low molecular weight poly¬propylene is prepared, which gives the product good melt-processing properties and<br>
improved stiffness. In step (c), the provided rubbeiy copolymet gives better impact resistance,<br>
In the process of the invention the order of steps (a) and (b) can freely be chosen. It isr however, preferable to perform step (a) before step (b). Although different catalyst systems of the above mentioned type can be used in steps (a) and (b), it is preferable to use the same catalyst system for both steps. According to a preferable embodiment, the catalyst system is added to step (a) and the same catalyst system is then used both in step (a) and (b).<br>
Steps (a) and (b) can be performed in reactors, which may be of any type con¬ventionally used for propylene polymerization and copolymerization preferentially a loop (CSTR) or gas phase reactor, but it is most preferable to perform one of steps (a) and (b) in a loop (CSTR) reactor and the other step in a gas phase reactor, whereby any reaction medium used and unreactive reagents are removed at least partly between step (a) and step (b). In such a case the procatalyst (also called catalyst in the art), cocatalyst and external donor is fed to the loop reactor. The reaction medium and uweacted reagents such as H2 or comonomer can be removed by known methods between the steps.<br>
Preferably, steps (a) and (b) are performed so that said polypropylene has a MFR2 value of between 0.1 and 12 g/10 min.<br>
It is also preferable to adjust the proportion of copolyraer resulting from step (a) and the MFR values of step (a) and step (b) so that the FRR value (MFRio/MFR2)7 which is also a measure of the molecular weight distribution, of said polypropylene is between 10 and 100, most preferably between 20 and 50.<br>
The catalyst used in the present process for the preparation of polypropylene can be any suitable catalyst, which consists of a procatalyst, which is a reaction product of at least tetravalent titanium compound and a magnesium halide compound, and a cocatalyst, which comprises an organoaluminium compound, an optionally external electron donor compound.<br>
Preferentially, said catalyst system has been prepared by:<br>
(i)    providing a procatalyst by reacting a magnesium halide compound, chosen<br>
from magnesium chloride, its complex with ethanol and other derivatives of<br>
magnesium chloride, with titanium tetrachloride and optionally with an internal donor, exemplified by the dialkyl phthalates,<br>
(ii) providing as cocatalyst an organoaluminium compound chosen from trialkyl aluminium exemplified by triethyl aluminium, dialkyl aluminium chloride, alkyl aluminium sesquichlonde, optionally<br>
(iii) providing as at least one external donor an ester of an aromatic acid exempli¬fied by methyl p-methyl benzoate, or an organosilicon compound exemplified by alkoxy silanes or blends thereof, and, optionally<br>
(iv) prepolymerizing a small amount of olefin by contacting the olefin with said procatalyst, cocatalyst and, optionally, the external donor.<br>
In step (a) of the present process, a portion of ethylene or a C4-Cio-a-olefin is preferably used, which leads to 1.0 to 7.0% by weight of ethylene or a C4-Cjo-a-olefin units in the random copolymer resulting from this step. Further in step (a) preferably no or a minimal amount of hydrogen is used, which leads to a MFRjQ value of between 0.05 and 2.0 g/min for the random copolymer resulting from this step, if the step is performed first. Also, the proportion of random copolymer resulting from step (a) is preferably from 40 to 80% by weight of said poly¬propylene. Thus it can be said, that the polypropylene prepared by the process of the invention contains preferably more random copolymer than low molecular weight homopolymer or minirandora copolymer.<br>
In step (b), low molecular weight essentially homopolymeric or minirandom (having little comonomer) propylene is produced. The molecular weight is adjusted by means of hydrogen. If the hydrogen amount is too high, the molecular weight will be too low and the product will be useless as pipe, profile or moulding material. In step (b) an amount of hydrogen is preferably used, which leads to a MFR 2 value of between 30 and 500 g/10 min for the polymer resulting from this step, if it performed first.<br>
As it was said before, too much ethylene units in the low molecular weight component leads to difficulties in retaining the stiffness properties of the product. Thus, in step (b) no or a minimal amount of ethylene is used, which preferably leads to 0.0 to 0.5% by weight of ethylene repeating units in the polymer resulting from this step. Preferably, the low molecular weight homopolymer fraction is smaller that the high molecular weight random copolymer fraction, Le. the proportion of polymer resulting from step (b) ia from 60 to 20?4 by weight of said polypropylene.<br>
The step (c) of providing an elastomer preferably follows steps (a) and (b) and, most preferentially, the order of steps is (a) =&gt; (b) =&gt; (c).<br>
The step (c) of providing an elastomer can be performed in two ways. According to the first and more preferable way, said elastomer is provided by copolymerizing at least propylene and ethylene into an elastomer. The conditions for the copolymerizatkm are within the limits of conventional EPM production conditions such as they are disclosed e.g. in Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Engineering, Second Edition, Vol. 6, p. 545-558. A rubbery product is formed if the ethylene repeating unit content in the polymer is within a certain interval. Thus, preferentially, in step (c), ethylene and propylene are copolymerized into an elastomer in such a ratio that the copolymer step (c) contains from 10 to 70% by weight of ethylene units. Most preferably, the ethylene unit content is from 30 to 50% by weight of the copolymeric propylene/ethylene elastomer.<br>
According to preferable embodiments of the invention, the following conditions are independently chosen for the three step process:<br>
a temperature in step (c) of between 40 and 90°C,<br>
said catalyst system is added to step (a) and used in both steps (a), (b) and (c),<br>
step (a) is performed in a loop (CSTR) reactor and steps (b) and (c) are performed in two separate gas phase reactors,<br>
the added comonomer portion is adjusted so that the proportion of ethylene repeating units after steps (a) and (b) is from 1 to 4% by weight and the proportion of ethylene repeating units after steps (a), (b) and (c) is from 5 to 15% by weight,<br>
in step (c), ethylene and propylene are copolymerized into an elastomer in a molar ratio ethylene/propylene of between 30/70-50/50.<br>
According to another embodiment of the claimed process, the elastomer in step (c) is provided by adding a ready-made or natural elastomer to the reaction product of steps (a) and (b), most preferably an impact modified heterophasic polypropylene having from 15 to 50% by weight of a propylene-ethylene elastomeric copolymer.<br>
As polypropylene for pipe, profile and moulding applications has not before been prepared with such a good shape preservance, the invention also relates to an extremely creep-resistant polypropylene for said applications. The creep resistance can be measured by registering the deflection of the material during 500-1000 h using 7.3 ar 6.5 MP&amp; load at 60°C. This new material ehows a creep level of I/*? to 1/2 of regular PP (pipe grade) material comparable to e.g. the PP material of<br>
comparative example 9, This is a sensational result and can open new application in e.g. piping.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, the creep-resistant polypropylene has been made according to the above described process for its preparation. According to another embodiment of the invention, the use of the above mentioned polypropylene is claimed, which use is directed to pipes, profiles, moulded articles and foams, fibres and films.<br>
In addition to ethylene and propylene, the process and the polypropylene according to the invention can contain from 0.0 to 10.0% by weight of any other olefin such as butene-1, 4-raethyl-pentene-l, hexene-1, octene-1 and decene-1 or combinations of them.<br>
The stiffness of this material is higher than that for materials produced with about the same comonomer content in several reactors or in only one reactor without loosing the impact. That is seen best when comparing the embodiment examples I to 10 with comparative examples 1 to 3 which are produced in the same conditions but with different ethylene feed splits. The entanglements and tie-chains of the high molecular fraction in the material give the material better pipe properties especially higher tensile strength tensile modulus charpy impact strength, and lower creep under load. The invented copolymers give also longer time to failure at same hoop stress levels in standard pipe pressure tests than the conventionally produced random pipe material.<br>
The invention is in the following illuminated by the following examples and comparative examples.<br>
Examples<br>
The following tests and preparations were made:<br>
Mechanical tests from 4 mm compression moulded plaques. The specimens were<br>
according to ISO 527.<br>
Tensile strength according to ISO 527 (cross head speed - 50 mm/min).<br>
Tensile modules according to ISO 527 (cross head speed = 1 mm/rain).<br>
Charpy, notched impact according to ISO 179/leA.<br>
Creep test is a Borealis tensile-creep-method for ranking of pipe materials. In the<br>
method a constant stress is applied to a specimen (a modified ISO dumb bell =120<br>
mm long, thickness = 2 mm). The test temperature = 60°C (oven) and the stress =<br>
7.3 mPa (for PP materials).<br>
The increase of strain with time is recorded 500 to 1000 h.<br>
The creep is defined as the elongation at 100 h in mm units corresponding to<br>
stiffness and the slope between 100 h and 400 h in angle units.<br>
This creep resistance test method is comparable to e.g. ISO 899-1, DIN 53444 and<br>
ASTM2990.<br>
