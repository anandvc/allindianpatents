				<td>NEW COMPOUNDS FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a new class of compounds, to pharmaceutical formulations containing said compounds and to the use of said compounds in therapy. The present invention further relates to the process for the preparation of said compounds and to new intermediates prepared therein.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). Glutarnate produces its effects on central neurons by binding to and thereby activating cell surface receptors. These receptors have been divided into two major classes, the ionotropic and metabotropic gmtamate receptors, based on the structural features of the receptor proteins, the means by which the receptors transduce signals into the cell, and pharmacological profiles.<br>
The metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are G protein-coupled receptors that activate a variety of intracellular second messenger systems following the binding of glutamate. Activation of mGluRs in intact mammalian neurons elicits one or more of the following responses: activation of phospholipase C; increases in phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis; intracellular calcium release; activation of phospholipase D; activation or inhibition of adenyl cyclase; increases or decreases in the formation of cyclic adenosine nionophosphate (cAMP); activation of guanylyl cyclase; increases in the formation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP); activation of phospholipase Aa; increases in arachidonic acid release; and increases or decreases in the activity of voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels. Schoepp et al, Trends Pharmacol Sci. J4:13 (1993), Schoepp, tfeurochem. Int. 24:439 (1994), Pin et al., Neuropharmacology 34:1 (1995), Bordi and Ugolini, Prog. Neurobiol. 59:55 (1999).<br>
Molecular cloning has identified eight distinct mGluR subtypes, termed mGluRl through mGluRS. Nakanishi, Neuron 75:1031 (1994), Pin et al., Neuropharmacology 34:1 (1995),<br><br>
Knopfel et al, J. Med. Ghent. 38:1417 (1995). Further receptor diversity occurs via expression of alternatively spliced forms of certain mGluR subtypes. Pin et al., PNAS 89:10331 (1992), Minakami et al., BBRC 199:1136 (1994), Joly et al., J. Neurosci. 15:3910 (1995).<br>
Metabotropic glutamate receptor subtypes may be subdivided into three groups, Group I, Group n, and Group IE mGluRs, based on amino acid sequence homology, the second messenger systems utilized by the receptors, and by their pharmacological characteristics. Group I mGluR comprises mGluRl, mGluRS and their alternatively spliced variants. The binding of agonists to these receptors results in the activation of phospholipase C and the subsequent mobilization of intracellular calcium.<br>
Attempts at elucidating the physiological roles of Group I mGluRs suggest that activation of these receptors elicits neuronal excitation. Various studies have demonstrated that Group I mGluRs agonists can produce postsynaptic excitation upon application to neurons in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and thalamus, as well as other CNS regions. Evidence indicates that this excitation is due to direct activation of postsynaptic mGluRs, but it also has been suggested that activation of presynaptic mGluRs occurs, resulting in increased neurotransmirter release. Baskys, Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 15:92 (1992), Schoepp, Neurochem. Int. 24:439 (1994), Pin et al., Neuropharmacology 34:1 (1995), Watkins et al., Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 15:33 (1994).<br>
Metabotropic glutamate receptors have been implicated in a number of normal processes in the mammalian CNS. Activation of mGluRs has been shown to be required for induction of hippocampal long-term potentiation and cerebellar long-term depression. Bashir et al., Nature 363:347 (1993), Bortolotto etal., Nature 368:740 (1994), Aiba et al, Cell 79:365 (1994), Aiba et al., Cell 79:377 (1994). A role for mGluR activation in nociception and analgesia also has been demonstrated, Meller et al., Neuroreport 4: 879 (1993), Bordi and Ugolini, Brain Res. 871:223 (1999). In addition, mGluR activation has been suggested to play a modulatory role in a variety of other normal processes including synaptic transmission, neuronal development, apoptotic neuronal death, synaptic plasticity, spatial learning, olfactory memory, central control of cardiac activity, waking, motor control and control of the vestibulo-ocular reflex. Nakanishi, Neuron 13: 1031 (1994), Pin et al., Neuropharmacology 34:1, Knopfel et al., J. Med. Chem. 35:1417 (1995).<br><br>
Further, Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors and mGluR5 in particular, have been suggested to play roles in a variety of pathophysiological processes and disorders affecting the CNS. These include stroke, head trauma, anoxic and ischemic injuries, hypoglycemia, epilepsy, neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and pain. Schoepp et al., Trends Pharmacol Sci. 14:13 (1993), Cunningham et al., Life Sci. 54:135 (1994), Hollman etal.,Ann. Rev. Neurosci. 77:31 (1994), Pin et al, Neuropharmacology 34:1 (1995), Knopfel etal, J. Med. Chem. 55:1417 (1995), Spooren et al., Trends Pharmacol Sci. 22:331 (2001), Gasparini et al. Cwr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2:43 (2002), Neugebauer Pain 98:1 (2002). Much of the pathology in these conditions is thought to be due to excessive glutamate-induced excitation of CNS neurons. Because Group I mGluRs appear to increase glutamate-mediated neuronal excitation via postsynaptic mechanisms and enhanced presynaptic glutamate release, their activation probably contributes to the pathology. Accordingly, selective antagonists of Group I mGluR receptors could be therapeutically Deneficial, specifically as neuroprotective agents, analgesics or anticonvulsants.<br>
decent advances in the elucidation of the neurophysiological roles of metabotropic glutamate receptors generally and Group I in particular, have established these receptors as promising drug targets in the therapy of acute and chronic neurological and psychiatric disorders and chronic and acute pain disorders. Because of their physiological and pathophysiological significance, there is a need for new potent mGluR agonists and antagonists that display a high selectivity for mGluR subtypes, particularly the Group I receptor subtype, most particularly the mGluR5 subtype.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide compounds exhibiting an activity at metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), especially at the mGluRS receptor.<br>

Pharmacology<br>
The pharmacological properties of the compounds of the invention can be analyzed using standard assays for functional activity. Examples of glutamate receptor assays are well known in the art as described in for example Aramori et al, Neuron 8:757 (1992), Tanabe et al., Neuron 8:169 (1992), Miller et al, J. Neuroscience 15: 6103 (1995), Balazs, et al., J. Neurochemistjy 69:151 (1997). The methodology described in these publications is incorporated herein by reference. Conveniently, the compounds of the invention can be studied by means of an assay that measures the mobilization of intracellular calcium, [Ca2+]j in cells expressing mGluR5.<br>
Intracellular calcium mobilization was measured by detecting changes in fluorescence of cells loaded with the fluorescent indicator fluo-3. Fluorescent signals were measured using the FTJPR system (Molecular Devices). A two addition experiment was used that could detect compounds that either activate or antagonize the receptor. For FLIPR analysis, cells expressing human mGluR5d were seeded on collagen coated clear bottom 96-well plates with black sides and analysis of [Ca2+]j mobilization was done 24 hours after seeding.<br>
FLIPR experiments were done using a laser setting of 0.800 W and a 0.4 second CCD camera shutter speed. Each FLIPR experiment was initiated with 160 pL of buffer-present in each well of the cell plate. After each addition of the compound, the fluorescence signal was sampled 50 times at 1 second intervals followed by 3 samples at 5 second intervals. Responses were measured as the peak height of the response within the sample period. ECso and ICso determinations were made from data obtained from S-point concentration response curves (CRC) performed in duplicate. Agonist CRC were generated by scaling all responses to the maximal response observed for the plate. Antagonist block of the agonist challenge was normalized to the average response of the agonist challenge in 14 control wells on the same plate.<br><br>
We have validated a secondary functional assay for raGluRSd based on Inositol Phosphate (IPs) turnover. IPs accumulation is measured as an index of receptor mediated phospholipase C turnover. GHEK cells stably expressing the human mGluRSd receptors were incubated with [3H] myo-inositol overnight, washed three times in HEPES buffered saline and pre-incubated for 10 minutes with 10 mM LiCl. Compounds (agonists) were added and incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C. Antagonist activity was determined by pre-incubating test compounds for 15 minutes, then incubating in the presence of glutamate (80uM) or DHPG (30 uM) for 30 minutes. Reactions were terminated by the addition of perchloric acid (5%). Samples were collected and neutralized, and inositol phosphates were separated using Gravity-Fed Ion-Exchange Columns.<br>

General syntheses of compounds of formula V.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
 compound of formula V, wherein R7 is independently selected from a group consisting of M'-CRVHR1)*!, M^Vx'-CMRXz, and M2-(R3)n-G wherein G is a leaving group or a group which may subsequently be transformed into a leaving group, may be prepared through cyclization of a compound of formula IV formed from a suitably activated compound of formula III, wherein LG is a leaving group, with a compound of formula II. The compound of formula II may be prepared from a suitable nitrile by addition of hydroxylamine in a suitable solvent such as, methanol, ethanol, water or mixture thereof, using an appropriate base such as hydroxide, carbonate or acetate. The compound of formula III may be activated as follows; i) as the acid chloride formed from the acid using a suitable reagent such as oxalyl chloride or thionyl chloride; ii) as an anhydride or mixed anhydride formed from treatment with a reagent such as alkyl chloroformate; iii) using traditional methods to activate acids in amide coupling reactions such as EDCI with HOBt or uronium salts like HBTU; iv) as an alkyl ester when the hydroxyamidine is deprotonated using a strong base like tert-butoxide; v) by any other suitable method of activation for the desired substrate.<br>
The ester formation may be accomplished using an appropriate aprotic solvent such as dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran, 7V,jV-diniethylformamide or toluene, with optionally an appropriate organic base such as triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine and the like or an inorganic base such sodium bicarbonate or potassium carbonate.<br><br>
The cyclization of the ester to form an oxadiazole may be carried out on the crude ester, with evaporation and replacement of the solvent with a higher boiling solvent such as DMF, or with aqueous extraction to provide a semi-purified material or with material purified by standard chromatographic methods. The cyclization may be accomplished by heating conventionally or by microwave irradiation (100-180°C), in a suitable solvent such as pyridine or N,JV-dimethylformamide or using a lower temperature method employing reagents like tetrabutylammonium fluoride in tetrahydrofuran or by any other suitable known literature method.<br>
Other compatible non-reacting functional groups suitably protected may also be present in the substrates.<br>
Further examples of the above described reactions can be found hi Poulain et al., Tetrahedron Lett., (2001), 42,1495-98, Ganglott et al.. Tetrahedron Lett., (2001), 42, 1441-43, which are hereby included as references.<br>
Synthesis of Nitrites and Acids for use in preparation of compounds of formula II and III<br>
Aryl nitriles are available by a variety of methods including cyanation of an aryl halide or triflate under palladium or nickel catalysis using an appropriate cyanide source such as zinc cyanide in an appropriate solvent such as A^A^-dimethylformamide. The corresponding acid is available from the nitrile by hydrolysis under either acidic or basic conditions in an appropriate solvent such as aqueous alcohols. Aryl acids are also available from a variety of other sources, including iodo- or bromo- lithium exchange followed by trapping with CO2 to give directly the acid.<br>
The acid may be converted to the primary amide using any compatible method to activate the acid, including via the acid chloride or mixed anhydride, followed by trapping with any source of ammonia, including ammonium chloride in the presence of a suitable base, ammonium hydroxide, methanolic ammonia or ammonia in an aprotic solvent such as dioxane. This amide intermediate may be converted to the nitrile using a variety of dehydration reagents such as oxalyl chloride or thionyl chloride. This reaction sequence to convert an acid into a nitrile may also be applied to non-aromatic acids, including suitably protected amino acid derivatives. A suitable protecting group for an amine, in an amino<br><br>
acid or in a remote position of any other acid starting material, may be any group which removes the basicity and nucleophilicity of the amine functionality, including such carbamate protecting group as Boc.<br>
Some acids are more easily prepared taking advantage of commercially available analogs. For example, 6-methylpyridine-4-carboxylic acid is prepared by dechlorination of 2-chloro-6-methylpyridine-4-carboxylic acid. Certain types of substituted fluoro-benzonitriles and benzoic acids are available from bromo-difluoro-benzene via displacement of one fluoro group with a suitable nucleophile such as imidazole in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate in a compatible solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide at elevated temperatures (80-120°C) for extended periods of time. The bromo group may subsequently be elaborated into the acid or nirrile as above. 1,3-Disubsituted and 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzoic acids and benzonitriles maybe prepared by taking advantage of readily available substituted isophthalic acid derivatives. Monohydrolysis of the diester allows selective reaction of the acid with a variety of reagents, most typically activating agents such as thionyl chloride, oxalyl chloride or isobutyl chlorofbrmate and the like. From the activated acid, a number of products are available. In addition to the primary amide used to form the nitrile by dehydration as mentioned above, reduction to the hydroxymethyl analog may be carried out on the mixed anhydride or acid chloride using a variety of reducing agents such as sodium borohydride in a compatible solvent such as tetrahydrofuran. The hydroxymethyl derivative may be further reduced to the methyl analog using catalytic hydrogenation with an appropriate source of catalyst such as palladium on carbon in an appropriate solvent such as ethanol. The hydroxymethyl group may also be used in any reaction suitable for benzylic alcohols such as acylation, alkylation, transformation to halogen and the like. Halomethylbenzoic acids of this type may also be obtained from bromination of the methyl derivative when not commercially available.

When other substituents are present, these may also be employed in standard transformation reactions. Treatment of an aniline with acid and sodium nitrite may yield a diazonium salt, which may be transformed into a halide such as fluoride using terrafluoroboric acid.<br><br>

A compound of formula XX, may be used to displace the leaving group LG in compounds of formula XIX (R7 is MI-(R2)n-P-(R1)ml). When X4 is represented by a heteroatom such as N and S, the reaction is carried out in the presence of an appropriate base such as potassium carbonate, cesium carbonate, sodium hydride, triethylamine or the like, which may facilitate the reaction by deprotonation of the X residue and prevent the formation of any excess acid that would be generated by the reaction in the absence of a base.

means of synthesizing a compound of formula Ic or Id, wherein X4 = O and wherein R7 is M'-(R2)n-P-(R!)mi&gt; may be by the O-alkylation of compounds of type XL with compounds of type XLI wherein the leaving group may consist of a tosyl-, mesyl-, halo- or any other appropriate group, in the a suitable base such as cesium or potassium carbonate, sodium hydride in solvents such as for example DMF or DMSO. Compounds of type XLI may be synthesized as exemplified with triazole XXVI by alkylation or arylation of the sulfur group using an apropriate alkylating or arylating<br>
reagent followed by double oxidation of the thiogroup to the corresponding suuouc using, oxidants such as MCPB A, hydrogen peroxide in acetic acid or potassium permanganate. Such a sequence has previously been described for example by Akerblom et al. J. Med. CJiem. 16,312 (1973).

The alcohols may be prepared either directly upon synthesis of the oxadiazole or isoxazole part as described above under general synthesis of compounds of formula V. Alternatively they may be prepared from an oxadiazole or isoxazole unit with an appropriate leaving group such as a halide, e.g. chloride, using a three step sequence as described by Palazzo et al.

Alternatively XLa may be obtained if hydroxybenzotriazole is present during cyclization to the oxadiazole, either as a co-activator with EDCI or as a result of a byproduct from a coupling reagent such as HBTU as described above under the reaction of compounds of formula II - V. XLa may be converted to the alcohol by the addition of samarium diiode, preferably over an elongated period of time (5-360 minutes) in a suitable solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, methanol, water or mixtures thereof, with THF being a preferred solvent, at an appropriate temperature (-75°C - +75°C). The cleavage of the N-O bond can alternatively be done using commonly used hydrogenation methods in the presence of a suitable catalyst such as raney-nickel as known by the one skilled in the art. hi compounds of formula XLa the oxobenzotriazole functionality may also serve as a leaving group.

Introduction of substitution in the Q ring:<br>
If substitution on the Q ring is desired, one may choose an appropriately substituted aryl or heteroaryl thiol to use for the displacement reaction. The same is valid for other nucleophilic reagents other than substituted or non-substituted aryl or heteroaryl thiols serving to substitute the same in the final compounds. If the aryl or heteroaryl residue has an amenable reactive moiety, either directly introduced or as a result of a deprotection reaction, including but not limited to a free NH site as in aniline, imidazole, benzimidazole, indole and the like, a compound of formula If (R7 is M1-(R2)n-P-(R1)mi) may be substituted with R4 using a suitable base such as an alkyllithium or alkali-metal hydride or hydroxide to deprotonate the NH residue, followed by the addition of a suitable electrophilic reagent such as an alkyl halides, acid chlorides or anhydrides, chloroformates, carbamoyl chlorides, sulfonyl chlorides, isocyanates, isothiocyanates and the like to provide the substituted product of Formula la. R<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
Introduction of the M2 substituent(s) and of the X4 substituent(s):<br>
When the most acidic protons are positioned on the atom adjacent to X4, or on X4 itself, substitution may be achieved by deprotonation of compound of Formual la with a strong base such as an alkyllithium or an alkali-metal hydride in a suitable aprotic non-acidic solvent like THF or diethylether followed by trapping of the resulting anion with a suitable electrophile such as alkyl halides, acid chlorides or anhydrides, chloroformates, carbamoyl chlorides, sulfonyl chlorides, isocyanates, isothiocyanates and the like. When an excess of base and electrophile are employed and the reaction is left for sufficient time, two hydrogens may be replaced by the electrophile as illustrated below for the introduction of two R3-substituents (M2 exemplified as carbon). Two or more, different or same substituents, might also be introduced accordingly by subsequent deprotonations and reactions with appropriate electrophiles to yield compounds of Formula Ig.<br>
(Figure Remove)Oxidation of S atom of chain (when X4 is S) or N atoms on substituents:<br>
Oxidation of the sulfur atom to give sulfones (Y=O) and sulfoxides (Y= ":", i.e. a lone pair) may be achieved by direct oxidation using any suitable oxidizing agent including peroxyacids such as MCPBA. In the case of MCPBA oxidation, it is possible to obtain a mixture of products from a single reaction and separate them by standard column chromatography or to obtain selectively the sulfoxide or sulfone by controlling the stoichiometry and temperature of the reaction.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
If one of the subsitutents, e.g. R4 contains one or more nitrogen atoms as for example a pyridine moiety or any other susbtituent as defined above, then oxidation of this nitrogen may occur in the above reaction of la with an oxidant such as MCPBA to give the<br>
corresponding N-oxide. It is understood to the one skilled in the art that such products may be obtained by separation via standard column chromatography or any other standard purifcation protocol even in the case of mixtures containing for example Ih and N-oxide. It is also understood to the skilled hi the art that the formation of N-oxides may be reduced by choice of suitable reaction conditions such as using acidic media to protect the nasic amine.<br>
Other miscellaneous reactions:<br>
When the intermediate compounds contain a suitable reactive functionality such as an aryl halide or triflate, the functionality may be employed to further elaborate the product. For example, when 3-halo-phenyl is present in P-(Rl)mi, it is possible to use standard Suzuki conditions to couple an aryl boronic acid to yield a diaryl coupling product. Miyaura, N., Yanagi, T., Suzuki, A., Synth.Commun., (1981),! 1; 7, 513-520.<br>
Other functionalities such as an aliphatic alcohol may for example be converted to a fluoro group by the use of a fluorinating agent such as DAST, or other halide groups by the use of for example triphenylphosphine and either iodine, N-bromosuccinimide or N-chlorosuccinimide These halides may serve as leaving groups for further elaboration or may remain as substituent in active compounds of formula la.<br>
In a similar fashion alcohols may be transformed to leaving grous such as the non-limiting examples mesyl or tosyl by employing the appropriate sulfonyl halide or sulfonyl anhydride in the presence of a non-nucleophilic base together with the alcohol to obtain the sulfonic ester derivative.<br>
Examples<br>
Other funtionalities which may be further elaborated are depicted in the following, non-limiting example (R7 is M1-(R2)n-P-(R1)mi ), where halogenation may be undergone on a carbon-atom of an oxazole unit employing a chlorinating agent such as sulfuryl chloride.<br>

FLIPR Assay of Group I receptor antagonist activity<br>
For FLIPR analysis, cells were seeded on collagen coated clear bottom 96-well plates with black sides and analysis of [Ca2+]j mobilization was performed 24 hours following seeding.<br>
Cell cultures in the 96-well plates were loaded with a 4 ^M solution of acetoxymethyl ester form of the fluorescent calcium indicator fluor-3 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oregon) in 0.01% pluronic. All assays were performed in a buffer containing 127 mM NaCl, 5 mM KC1,2 mM MgCl2, 0.7 mM NaH2PO4,2 mM CaCl2,0.422 rag/ml NaHCOs, 2.4 mg/rnl HEPES, 1.8 mg/ml glucose and 1 mg/ml BSA Fraction IV (pH 7.4). FLIPR experiments were done using a laser setting of 0.800 W and a 0.4 second CCD camera shutter speed with excitation and emission wavelengths of 488 nm and 562 nm, respectively. Each FLEPR experiment was initiated with 160 p.L of buffer present in each well of the cell plate. A 40 ^L addition from the antagonist plate was followed by a 50 ^L addition from the agonist plate. After each addition the fluorescence signal was sampled 50 times at 1 second intervals followed by 3 samples at 5 second intervals. Responses were measured as the peak height of the response within the sample period. ECsoflCso determinations wore made from data obtained from 8 point concentration response curves (CRC) performed in duplicate. Agonist CRC were generated by scaling all responses to the maximal response observed for the plate. Antagonist block of the agonist challenge was normalized to the average response of the agonist challenge in 14 control wells on the same plate.<br>
