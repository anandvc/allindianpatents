				<td>A POWER SYSTEM<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to fuel cell electric power systems, and particularly<br>
to power systems and methods for operating the same, and more particularly for<br>
improving the performance of fuel cell stacks in such fuel cell electric power systems.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
Fuel cells electrochemically react a fuel stream comprising hydrogen and an<br>
oxidant stream comprising oxygen to generate an electric current. Fuel cell electric<br>
power systems employing stakes of fuel cells are used in a variety of transportation,<br>
portable and stationary power applications.<br>
Performance losses have been observed in fuel cells employing catalysts<br>
comprising platinum (Pt.). For example, under constant current conditions the voltage<br>
of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells typically is initially as high as 0.9 V, but<br>
begins to fall fairly quickly. Similarly, under constant voltage conditions, particularly at<br>
higher voltages, the initial current drops from its original output value. This performance<br>
loss has been attributed to various sources, including carbon monoxide poisoning of the<br>
catalyst and loss of cathode catalyst activity due to adsorption of oxides from water.<br>
Several approaches have been employed for reversing this performance<br>
degradation. For example, US 5,601,936 discloses applying a reverse DC potential to<br>
the anode and cathode of a fuel cell. CA 2,284,589 discloses pulsing the anode<br>
potential by temporarily shorting the anode and cathode or by producing a positive<br>
voltage pulse with an external DC voltage source. Conversely, US 2001/0044040 A1<br>
discloses switching the cathode to an output load to reduce the cell voltage at a pulse<br>
width effective to reverse performance degradation. US 6,096,448 discloses fuel<br>
starving a fuel cell stack<br><br>
by connecting a transient load to the stack. Both US 6,096,449 and US<br>
6,451,470 B1 disclose periodically shorting fuel cells.<br>
US 6,096,449 also discloses a shunt controller coupled to<br>
numerous shunt control circuits corresponding to each fuel cell in the system.<br>
The shunt controller also comprises a pair of voltage sensors, a bypass circuit<br>
coupling the anode and cathode together, and a current sensor associated with<br>
each fuel cell. The shunt controller further controls a fuel gas shut-off control<br>
valve for terminating supply of fuel gas to a fuel cell.<br>
These approaches have one or more disadvantages. First, they<br>
may result in power fluctuations to the external load when the fuel cell stack is<br>
shorted or its current or voltage is pulsed. This is problematic in applications<br>
where the external load is intolerant of the magnitude and/or frequency of such<br>
power fluctuations. Alternatively, the external load may be disconnected from<br>
the fuel cell stack during pulsing, undesirably interrupting power supply to the<br>
load.<br>
Second, the control systems involved in implementing such<br>
approaches tend to be overly complex. The complexity of the shunt controller<br>
in US 6,096,449, for example, may undesirably increase the cost and decrease<br>
operational reliability of the overall system.<br>
It is desirable to have a method and apparatus for operating a fuel<br>
cell electric power system that not only increases the performance of the fuel<br>
cell stack, but is also relatively inexpensive, reliable and electrically efficient.<br>
The present invention addresses the disadvantages of conventional fuel cell<br>
power systems and provides further related advantages.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the following description, certain specific details are set forth in<br>
order to provide a thorough understanding of the various embodiments of the<br>
invention. However, one skilled in the art will understand that the invention may<br>
be practiced without these details. In other instances, well-known structures<br><br>
associated with fuel cells, fuel cell stacks, batteries and fuel cell systems have<br>
not been shown or described in detail to avoid unnecessarily obscuring<br>
descriptions of the embodiments of the invention.<br>
Unless the context requires otherwise, throughout the<br>
specification and claims which follow, the word "comprise" and variations<br>
thereof, such as, "comprises" and "comprising" are to be construed in an open,<br>
inclusive sense, that is as "including, but not limited to."<br>
The headings provided herein are for convenience only and do<br>
not interpret the scope or meaning of the claimed invention.<br>
Current pulsing involves shorting or connecting a load across a<br>
fuel cell or fuel cell stack in order to drop the voltage of the fuel cell(s)<br>
sufficiently to restore catalyst activity.<br>
As discussed, performance losses have been observed in fuel<br>
cells employing catalysts comprising Pt, presumably due to loss of cathode<br>
catalyst activity over time. Immediately after current pulsing the fuel cell stack,<br>
the voltage of the fuel cell stack increases substantially. In typical PEM fuel<br>
cells, for example, the cell voltage will jump to about 0.76 V at full rated current<br>
immediately after a short is released. Cell voltage then decays over time back<br>
to some equilibrium value. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that<br>
this effect is due to stripping of oxygen species (and possibly other adsorbed<br>
species) from the cathode catalyst during pulsing, which restores catalyst<br>
activity; subsequent re-oxidation of the catalyst over time reduces its activity<br>
again.<br>
Figure 1 shows a graph 1 of net stack voltage 2 of a NEXA™ fuel<br>
cell stack over time demonstrating this above described effect. The operating<br>
conditions were as follows: the reactants were hydrogen and humidified air,<br>
supplied at a pressure of 5 psig (35 kPa); reactant inlet temperature of 65 °C;<br>
15 A output current; and, a 500 ms short was applied every minute. Each<br>
vertical line in Figure 1 corresponds to an electrical shorting of the fuel cell<br>
stack; the voltage 2 slowly decays over time until the next short.<br><br>
The applicant has determined that, at least in some applications,<br>
shorting the stack can cause the fuel cell voltage to rise to an unacceptable<br>
level. Figure 2 shows a 3-D graph 3 of the voltage decay curve 4 for each<br>
pulse shown in Figure 1. Note the region of unstable voltage in the roughly 7 -<br>
8 seconds following each short of the fuel cell stack.<br>
Again, without being bound by theory, the applicant believes that<br>
the voltages on the fuel cells immediately following the short are high enough<br>
that corrosion of the cathode catalyst carbon support (and possibly of other<br>
carbon materials on the cathode side of the fuel cell) may occur.<br>
Figure 3 shows a graphical illustration of generalized current and<br>
voltage curves 5, 6, respectively, for a representative fuel cell that has been<br>
shorted for a brief time. Immediately after the short is released, the voltage of<br>
the fuel cell reaches a peak A and begins to fall off before reaching an<br>
equilibrium level. In region A, carbon corrosion can occur that may damage the<br>
cathode catalyst support and/or other cathode structures. Repeated exposure<br>
to such high voltages at higher current densities may result in significant carbon<br>
corrosion, which is reflected in the voltage instability observed in Figure 2.<br>
Figure 4 shows a power system 10 according to one illustrated<br>
embodiment, providing power to an external load 12. Details of the power<br>
system 10 not directly relevant to the present discussion, such as reactant<br>
supply systems and cooling systems, are not shown.<br>
The power system 10 comprises a fuel cell stack 14 electrically<br>
coupled between rails of a power bus 16, a pulsing switch S1 electrically<br>
coupled across the fuel cell stack, and a controller 18 coupled to control the<br>
pulsing switch S1. The controller 18 may take the form of an oscillator 20,<br>
providing a simple, inexpensive and reliable circuit for current pulsing.<br>
In the embodiment illustrated in Figure 4, the pulsing switch S1 is<br>
operable to selectively short the fuel cell stack 14, for example, in response to<br>
pulsed signals 21 generated by the oscillator 20. In other embodiments, the<br>
pulsing switch S1 is operable to selectively place a pulsing load 22 (Figure 5)<br>
across the fuel cell stack 14. In such embodiments, the pulsing load 22 placed<br><br>
across the fuel ceil stack 14 should be small to ensure a sufficiently fast<br>
removal of charge from the anodes of the fuel cells. Shorting the fuel cell stack<br>
14 is preferred over placing the pulsing load 22 across the fuel cell stack 14, to<br>
achieve the fastest possible recovery of the fuel cell stack 14.<br>
The power system 10 may include one or more internal loads 24,<br>
which represent the various active components, for example, processors,<br>
sensors, indicators, valves, heaters, compressors, fans, and/or actuators such<br>
as solenoids. With respect to fuel cell systems, these internal loads 24 are<br>
typically referred to as the "balance of plant" ...The internal load 24 is electrically<br>
coupled to the power bus 16 in parallel with the fuel cell stack 14 to receive<br>
power therefrom.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 4, in some embodiments the power system<br>
10 may further comprise an electrical storage device 26 electrically coupled in<br>
    parallel with the fuel cell stack 14 to form of a hybrid power system 10. In such<br>
embodiments, the electrical storage device 26 provides current to the load(s)<br>
12, 24 during the time when the stack current is pulsed. In such embodiments,<br>
the power system 10 may employ a diode D1 to protect the electrical storage<br>
device 26 from transients, such as those resulting from the short circuiting of<br>
the fuel cell stack 14.<br>
The electrical storage device 26 may take a variety of forms<br>
suitable for storing and releasing stored energy, for example, one or more<br>
batteries such as one or more valve regulated lead acid ("VRLA") batteries 28<br>
(Figure 6), and/or one or more super-capacitors 30 (Figure 7). In embodiments<br>
where the electrical storage device 26 is a VRLA battery 28, for example,<br>
voltage variation to the loads 12, 24 may occur during stack current pulsing. In<br>
embodiments where the electrical storage device 26 is a super-capacitor band<br>
30, such voltage variations may be easily filtered out.<br>
Where the power system 10 includes an electrical storage device   <br>
26, the fuel cell stack 14 begins providing charging current to the electrical<br>
storage device 26 after the current pulse. Thus, the electrical storage device 26<br>
may sink excess current generated by the fuel cell stack 14 after each current<br><br>
pulse to clamp the voltage of the fuel cell stack 14 below a maximum stack<br>
voltage limit Vz. For example, if the power system 10 has an equilibrium stack<br>
voltage that is less than a "float" voltage of the electrical storage device 26, the<br>
electrical storage device 26 continues to sink a portion of the current from the<br>
fuel cell stack 14 for as long as the stack voltage exceeds the "float" voltage of<br>
the electrical storage device 26.<br>
The diode D1 may be selected so that the fuel cell stack 14<br>
provides current to the loads 12, 24 only when the stack voltage is at or above<br>
a preset voltage limit. For example, where the electrical storage device 26 is a<br>
VRLA battery 28 the preset voltage limit may be the float voltage of the battery,<br>
about 27.4 V. When the stack voltage falls below the diode voltage limit, the<br>
energy storage device 26 supplies power to the load 12, 24 and the oscillator<br>
20 implements a short circuit of the fuel cell stack 14 by closing pulsing switch<br>
S1. Opening pulsing switch S1 releases the short: and the fuel cell stack 14<br>
resumes supplying power to the loads 12, 24 and supplies current to recharge<br>
the electrical storage device 26. At high loads, this arrangement maintains the<br>
stack voltage below the maximum stack voltage limit Vz.<br>
The use of an electrical storage device 26 to clamp voltage is one<br>
approach to addressing the undesirable voltage spike identified in Figures 2<br>
and 3. Figure 8 shows a graphical illustration of generalized current and<br>
voltage curves, 32, 34, respectively, for a fuel cell stack 14 in a representative<br>
hybrid power system (e.g., including fuel cell stack 14 and battery 28) that has<br>
been shorted for a brief time. The amount of current in region B of Figure 8<br>
includes the load current and battery charging current supplied by the fuel cell<br>
stack 14. The additional charging current supplied by the fuel cell stack 14 is<br>
sufficient to clamp the stack voltage at a determined maximum stack voltage<br>
limit Vz.<br>
The timing or frequency of the current pulsing may be set or<br>
varied. For example, the current pulsing may be set to a defined periodic<br>
interval Tw, for example, occurring once a minute during operation (i.e., 60 Hz).<br>
' Alternatively, the controller 18 can short the fuel cell stack 14 whenever the<br><br>
stack voltage falls below a preset voltage limit, such as the "float" voltage of the<br>
electrical storage device 26. The preset voltage limit may be chosen by<br>
employing a number of fuel cells in the fuel cell stack 14 that is equal to the<br>
number of fuel cells necessary to produce the desired "float" voltage. For<br>
example, if a minimum operating fuel cell voltage of at least 0.67 V is desired,<br>
and the float voltage of the electrical storage device 26 is 27.4 V, then the fuel<br>
cell stack 14 would require at least 41 cells. Thus, the power system 10 may<br>
employ the frequency of the current pulsing to control the rate of charge<br>
transfer to the battery 28 or super-capacitor 30. When employing such an<br>
approach, the current pulsing frequency at a given load can be used to<br>
determine the amount of pollutants in the air being supplied to the stack; the<br>
higher the frequency of pulsing, the greater the concentration of pollutants, thus<br>
providing an additional advantage.<br>
A duration Tp of the current pulse may also be set or varied. For<br>
example, the duration of each current pulse may be predefined. For example, a<br>
pulse duration of approximately 500 milliseconds has been found to be<br>
particularly suitable with a current pulse frequency of 60 Hz. Alternatively, the<br>
duration may be adjusted based on a number of operating parameters and/or<br>
conditions of the power system 10, load 12 and/or fuel cell stack 14.<br>
The above described method and apparatus can produce very<br>
high performance efficiencies from the fuel cells. For example, in a power<br>
system 10 employing a NEXA™ fuel cell stack 14 and VRLA battery 28, by<br>
current pulsing the fuel cell stack 14 when the stack voltage falls below the 27.4<br>
V battery float voltage, the fuel cells may operate at an average voltage of<br>
about 0.69 V. This corresponds to a 57% efficiency, with the control system<br>
generating very low parasitic cooling loss and no power conversion losses at<br>
any load current. Furthermore, because the electrical storage device 26<br>
supplies current when the fuel cell current is pulsed, there is no interruption of<br>
current to the external load 12 or internal load 24.<br>
In other embodiments, the current drawn from the fuel cell stack<br>
14 is increased for a short time immediately following the current pulse.<br><br>
Figures 9 and 10 are graphical illustrations of generalized current curves 36 38,<br>
respectively, and voltage curves 40, 42, respectively, for a representative fuel<br>
cell that has been shorted for a brief time according to these embodiments. In<br>
Figure 9, the current 36 drawn from the fuel cell stack 14 after the current pulse<br>
is increased, as indicated in region B. The corresponding voltage curve 40 is<br>
flattened, avoiding the possible carbon corrosion associated with the voltage<br>
spike indicated by region A in Figure 3. In Figure 9 the current increase is just<br>
sufficient to clamp the fuel cell stack voltage at a desired maximum stack<br>
voltage limit Vz.<br>
In practice, it may be difficult to control the current increase after<br>
pulsing in order to clamp the stack voltage with this degree of accuracy. In<br>
other embodiments, the magnitude of current increase after pulsing is at least<br>
occasionally greater than required to clamp the stack voltage at a desired<br>
maximum stack voltage limit Vz. This situation is illustrated in Figure 10, where<br>
the current 38 drawn from the cell in region B is greater than in Figure 9, with<br>
the result that the stack voltage 42 in region C is correspondingly lower. The<br>
additional heat generated in the fuel cell stack 14 by the larger current increase<br>
after pulsing is more than offset by preventing carbon corrosion at the cathode.<br>
The current required to recharge the electrical storage device 26<br>
after pulsing the stack current depends on the size of the load 12, 24 that is<br>
carried by electrical storage device 26 and the duration of the current pulse. In<br>
some applications, partial or low load conditions may be experienced. At low<br>
loads it is possible that the recharge current will not be high enough to clamp<br>
the fuel cell voltage after current pulsing. In certain embodiments, therefore,<br>
current pulsing may be discontinued under low load conditions. This approach<br>
is particularly suited for applications where is anticipated that the power system<br>
will not be under low load conditions often or for significant periods.<br>
Figures 11-13 illustrate other embodiments of the power system<br>
10, which include additional circuitry to clamp the stack voltage in response to<br>
current pulsing, particularly suitable under partial or low load conditions. These<br>
other embodiments, and those other embodiments and other alternatives<br><br>
WO 2004/100298<br><br>
PCT/CA2004/000653<br><br>
described herein, are substantially similar to previously described<br>
embodiments, and thus common acts and structures are identified by the same<br>
reference numbers. Only significant differences in operation and structure are<br>
described below. Further, as discussed above, the various embodiments of the<br>
power systems may rely on the fuel cell stack 14 as the sole source of power;<br>
hence, the electrical storage devices 26 in Figures 11 - 13 are optional.<br>
Figure 11 shows a zener diode D2 electrically coupled across the<br>
power bus 16 in parallel with the fuel cell stack 14. The breakdown voltage of<br>
the zener diode D2 is selected such that the zener diode D2 clamps the stack<br>
    voltage below the desired maximum stack voltage limit Vz when operating<br>
under low load conditions, as illustrated by accompanying the voltage curve 44,<br>
and as compared to operation under high load conditions as illustrated by<br>
accompanying voltage curve 46.<br>
Figure 12 shows a shunt regulator 48 electrically coupled across<br>
the power bus 16 in parallel with the fuel cell stack 14. The shunt regulator 48<br>
is formed by a zener diode D2, gate resistor R and a transistor 50. The zener<br>
diode D2 and gate resistor R are electrically coupled to a gate of the transistor<br>
50, to selectively activate the transistor 50 to clamp the stack voltage below the<br>
desired maximum stack voltage limit Vz when operating under low load<br>
conditions, as illustrated by the accompanying voltage curve 44, and as<br>
compared to operation under high load conditions as illustrated by<br>
accompanying voltage curve 46.<br>
Figure 13 shows the controller 18, including the oscillator 20 and<br>
shunt regulator logic 52. The shunt regulator logic 52 may be implemented in<br>
software, firmware and/or hardware, and is executed by the controller 18. The<br>
controller 18 receives signals representative of a voltage sensed by a voltage<br>
sensor 54. The controller 18 provides control signals 21, 53 to operate a<br>
switch, such as a field effect transistor Q1, via diodes D3, D4 and a resistor R<br>
to clamp the stack voltage below the desired maximum stack voltage limit Vz<br>
when operating under low load conditions, as illustrated by accompanying the<br><br>
voltage curve 44, and as compared to operation under high load conditions as<br>
illustrated by accompanying voltage curve 46.<br>
In further embodiments, the electrical storage device 26 carries<br>
the load 12, 24 for a time before the stack current is pulsed and the fuel cell<br>
stack 14 provides recharge current afterwards. The time the electrical storage<br>
device 26 carries the load 12, 24 may be selected to compensate for the low<br>
load conditions, so that the recharge current is increased sufficiently to clamp<br>
the stack voltage at a predetermined maximum stack voltage limit Vz.<br>
Figure 14 shows another embodiment of the power system 10,<br>
comprising a fuel cell stack isolation switch S2 operable to electrically couple<br>
and uncouple the loads 12,24 from the fuel cell stack 14. The controller 18<br>
receives signals 56 representing the stack current from a stack current sensor<br>
58, and operates the fuel cell stack isolation switch S2 as discussed<br>
immediately below, to clamp the stack voltage below the desired maximum<br>
stack voltage limit Vz when operating under low load conditions, as illustrated<br>
by accompanying voltage curve 60, and when operating under high load<br>
conditions as illustrated by accompanying voltage curve 62.<br>
Figure 15 is a flow chart for a control algorithm 100 for current<br>
pulsing the power system 10 of Figure 14 according to one illustrated<br>
embodiment.<br>
In step 102, the current sensor 58 measures the stack current. In<br>
step 104, the controller 18 determines the amount of energy which will be<br>
required to support the loads 12, 24 during the duration of the short circuit<br>
condition. In step 106, the controller 18 determines the amount of energy that<br>
will need to be clipped off after the short circuit condition ends in order to avoid<br>
exceeding the maximum stack voltage limit Vz. The steps 104 and 106 can<br>
occur in any order, and can even occur simultaneously.<br>
In step 108, the controller 18 determines the energy to be pre-<br>
removed (i.e., prior to current pulse) from the energy storage device 26, which<br>
places the electrical storage device 26 in condition to sink the required amount<br>
of stack current in order to avoid exceeding the maximum stack voltage limit Vz.<br><br>
after current pulsing. In step 110, the controller 18 determines the period of<br>
time required to remove the energy given the present load.<br>
In step 112, the controller 18 causes the fuel cell stack isolation! ?<br>
switch S2 to open, isolating the loads 12, 24 from the fuel cell stack 14,and <br>
thereby causing the electrical storage device 26 to discharge to a suitable level<br>
by supplying the loads 12, 24 in place of the fuel cell stack 14. In step 114, the<br>
controller 18 waits the period determined in step 110. At the end of the<br>
determined period, the controller 18 closes the pulsing switch S1, current<br>
pulsing the fuel cell stack 14 by providing a short circuit path, or by placing a<br>
load 22 (Figure 22), across the fuel cell stack 14.<br>
In step 118, the controller 18 waits a pulse duration, for example,<br>
500 milliseconds, after the closing of the pulsing switch S1. In step 120 the<br>
controller 18 causes the fuel cell stack isolation switch S2 to close, coupling the<br>
loads 12, 24 to the fuel cell stack 14. The steps 118 and 120 can occur in any<br>
order, and can even occur simultaneously. At the end of the pulse duration Tp,<br>
the controller 18 opens the pulsing switch S1, terminating the current pulse by<br>
removing the short circuit path or load 22 across the fuel cell stack 14. Various<br>
approaches to determining the time period TP were discussed above.<br>
In step 124, the controller 18 waits a time period Tw, for example<br>
a time period sufficient for the stack voltage to drop to the point that another<br>
current pulse is required, before returning control to step 102. Various<br>
approaches to determining the time period Tw were discussed above.<br>
When executing the control algorithm 100, the controller 18 may<br>
compare the present stack voltage and current using a polarization look-up<br>
table to determine where the fuel cell stack 14 is operating on its polarization<br>
curve. Other means of determining where the fuel cell stack 14 is on its<br>
polarization curve may also be used.<br>
Figure 16 shows another embodiment of the power system 10,<br>
similar to that shown in Figure 14, above. The embodiment of Figure 16<br>
includes a number of MOSFETS electrically coupled in parallel to form the<br>
pulsing switch S1 particularly suited to high current loads. The embodiment of<br><br>
Figure 16 also shows a number of MOSFETS and associated diodes<br>
electrically coupled in parallel to form fuel stack isolation switch S2 particularly<br>
suited to high current loads.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
A hybrid electric power system 10 comprising a NEXA™ fuel cell<br>
stack 14 and a 24 V VRLA battery bank 28 was operated with and without<br>
pulsing the stack current. The power system 10 in each case was supplied<br>
hydrogen and humidified air at 5 psig (35 kPa) and operated at a reactant inlet<br>
temperature of 65 °C.<br>
For the first run, the air was supplied to the fuel cell stack 14 at a<br>
stoichiometry of about 2.6. Operating without current pulsing, the power<br>
system maintained a voltage of 26.9 V at 34 A, which corresponds to about 915<br>
W net output. The NEXA™ fuel cell stack 14 is rated for 1000 W net output, so<br>
this unit was underperforming.<br>
The power system 10 was then configured as illustrated in Figure<br>
13. The shorting circuit (i.e., pulsing switch S1) consists of three MOSFETs in<br>
parallel. A 500 ms short is triggered by a manual pushbutton (not shown). The<br>
linear regulator FET, consisting of two IRFP2907 MOSFETs, limits the amount<br>
of current that can be drawn from the stack and maintains an output voltage to<br>
hold the batteries at a float voltage of 27.3 V. The Schottky diodes prevent<br>
shorting of the batteries. 500 ms shorting pulses were applied about once per<br>
minute during operation. The air stoichiometry was also increased to about 2.7,<br>
based on preliminary results that indicated a corresponding increase in stack<br>
voltage of about 1 V. The run time was 40 minutes. The power system 10<br>
maintained a voltage of 27.3 V at 56.5 A, corresponding to about 1540 W net<br>
output. This represents a 68% increase in net power output, an additional 625<br>
W.<br>
Although specific embodiments of, and examples for, the power<br>
system and associated methods are described herein for illustrative purposes,<br>
various equivalent modifications can be made without departing from the spirit<br><br>
and scope of the invention, as will be recognized by those skilled in the relevant<br>
art. The teachings provided herein of the invention can be applied to other<br>
power systems, not necessarily the exemplary hybrid power system generally<br>
described above.<br>
For example, the present method and apparatus may be<br>
employed in electric power systems 10 having fuel cell stacks 14 as the sole<br>
source of power. While such embodiments are less costly, it should be noted<br>
that the omission of the electrical storage device 24 will typically result in an<br>
interruption of current supply to the external load(s) 12 during current pulsing.<br>
Also for example, the power system may employ electrical storage devices.<br>
The various embodiments described above can be combined to<br>
provide further embodiments. All of the above U.S. patents, U.S. patent<br>
application publications, U.S. patent applications, foreign patents, foreign patent<br>
applications and non-patent publications referred to in the this specification<br>

reference in their entirety. Aspects of the invention can be modified, if<br>
necessary, to employ systems, circuits and concepts of the various patents,<br>
applications and publications to provide yet further embodiments of the<br>
invention.<br>

the above-detailed description. In general, in the following claims, the terms<br>
