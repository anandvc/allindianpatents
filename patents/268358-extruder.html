				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Extruder<br>
[0001]	 This invention relates to an extruder according to the preamble of claim 1.<br>
[0002]	 Extruders are often used for conveying and processing substances. To<br>
separate gases during processing of plastics in an extruder, a gas outlet opening is<br>
provided in the housing of the process section of the extruder in which the solid or<br>
viscous plastic is processed. To prevent plastic from being discharged from the process<br>
section through said opening, the material retaining device is provided, also known as<br>
the "stuffer". It has one or two screw shafts whose screw has a direction of thread over<br>
the total length by which it forces plastic entering said opening back into the process<br>
section, while gas passing through the screw can be drawn off.<br>
[0003]	 As has turned out, however, plastic extruded with an extruder having such a<br>
retaining device shows a great number of black specks, which are extremely disturbing<br>
in particular in products made of transparent plastic, such as PET.<br>
[0004]	 The problem of the invention is to provide an extruder having such a<br>
retaining device at the gas outlet opening which largely eliminates the formation of<br>
black specks.<br>
[0005]	 This is obtained according to the invention by the extruder characterized in<br>
claim 1. Advantageous embodiments of the invention are rendered in the subclaims.<br>
[0006]	 As has turned out, the formation of black specks is due to the fact that the<br>
screw shaft and the inside wall of the retaining device have the same high temperature<br>
as the process section. In the known extruder, plastic residues adhering to the hot<br>
screw shaft or inside wall of the retaining device can thus decompose. Since the<br>
decomposition depends on the duration at which a plastic residue adheres to the hot<br>
metal surface of the screw or the inside wall of the retaining device, a plastic residue<br>
transported by the screw over its total length as far as the gas outlet opening in the<br>
intermediate housing of the material retaining device will naturally undergo<br>
particularly great decomposition. The solid products of decomposition are then, in the<br>
known extruder, conveyed by the material retaining device screw backfeeding over its<br><br>
-2-<br>
fuil length back to the process section and mixed with the plastic in the process section<br>
to form the black specks in the extruded plastic product.<br>
[0007]	 Starting out from this finding, the invention is based on giving only the<br>
portion of the material retaining device screw adjacent the process section a<br>
backfeeding design. The plastic is in contact with said portion only a short time.<br>
Moreover, in said portion the material is continually replaced on the hot screw surface<br>
and inside wall as in the process section. This prevents decomposition of the plastic<br>
and thus a formation of black specks in said portion.<br>
[0008]	 In contrast, plastic residues passing through said portion of the material<br>
retaining device reach the screw portion with the opposite pitch according to the<br>
invention, i.e. they are no longer conveyed back to the process section but away<br>
therefrom and are thus separated from the process section. In this area they are thus<br>
exposed to the hot temperature of the screw and the inside wall of the intermediate<br>
housing for some time and are decomposed. The solid black decomposition specks can<br>
be drawn off together with the separated gas through the gas outlet opening in the<br>
intermediate housing, or an additional opening on the underside of the intermediate<br>
housing can be provided for the residues to drop through.<br>
[0009]	 The process section of the inventive extruder can have only one screw shaft.<br>
However, there can also be provided two or more, in particular eight or more, axially<br>
parallel screw elements which can closely intermesh, the screw shafts being received<br>
and guided by axially parallel concave circular segments on the inside wall of the<br>
extruder housing. A plurality of said screw shafts can be disposed in a plane or form a<br>
ring, as described in EP 0 788 867 B1.<br>
[0010]	 The material retaining device can likewise have only one screw shaft.<br>
However, it is preferable to provide two or more axially parallel screw shafts whose<br>
screws closely intermesh and which are in each case received and guided by axially<br>
parallel concave circular segments in the inside wall of the extruder housing.<br>
[0011]	 It is possible to use corotating or counterrotating screws in the material<br>
retaining device. Since counterrotating screw shafts form an axially closed system<br><br>
-3-<br>
unlike the axially open system of corotating screw shafts, i.e. counterrotating screw<br>
shafts cause forced conveyance, counterrotating screw shafts are generally preferred in<br>
the material retaining device since they prevent the occurrence of black specks even<br>
more rigorously.<br>
[0012]	 Moreover, the self-cleaning of counterrotating screws is fundamentally<br>
better than of corotaling screws, since with counterrotating screws their crests touch<br>
each other and lie against the inside wall of the intermediate housing, while corotating<br>
screws have a clearance between the crests of the screws and the inside wall. Wear can<br>
be combated by hardening the screws and the intermediate housing.<br>
[0013]	 With counterrotating screw shafts it is furthermore possible to completely<br>
omit drive gears on the screw shafts if need be, since only one shaft needs to be driven<br>
which drives the other shaft by form-fitting engagement of the screws. This<br>
substantially simplifies the installation, assembly and maintenance of the screw shafts.<br>
[0014]	 The screw shafts of the material retaining device are preferably formed in<br>
one piece with their drive, for example a drive gear. There is thus no coupling between<br>
screw shaft and drive gear as provided according to the prior art. The split gear box<br>
driving the screw shafts can thus be built small, light and economically.<br>
[0015]	 So that no toxic gases can escape from the extruder unchecked, but also to<br>
prevent air from passing into the extruder, the intermediate housing with the material<br>
retaining device must be connected vacuumtight to the extruder housing and to the<br>
split gear box, whereby the split gear box must in turn be of vacuumtight form.<br>
|0016]	 Since the split gear box contains bearings, seals and similar parts that can be<br>
damaged at the high temperature of the process section of for example approx. 250°C,<br>
it is advantageous to dispose heat insulating means, for example an insulating plate,<br>
between the intermediate housing with the material retaining device and the split gear<br>
box.<br>
[0017]	 The inventive extruder is particularly suitable for processing plastics, such as<br>
PVC, PE and others. Since the formation of black specks is largely prevented, it is<br><br>
-4-<br>
particularly suitable for producing transparent plastic products, in particular water-<br>
clear products, for example made of PET.<br>
[0018]	 Embodiments of the inventive extruder will hereinafter be explained more<br>
closely with reference to the enclosed drawing. The figures are described as follows,<br>
each showing a perspective view:<br>
Figure 1 a segment of the process section of the extruder with the material retaining<br>
device connected thereto;<br>
Figure 2 a material retaining device with two counterrotating screw shafts, the<br>
housing of the material retaining device being whole and a part of the<br>
housing of the split gear box being omitted;<br>
Figure 3 a view corresponding to Figure 2, but of a material retaining device having<br>
two corotating screw shafts;<br>
Figure 4 a view corresponding to Figure 2, but of screw shafts without drive gears;<br>
and<br>
Figure 5 the material retaining device removed from the process section.<br>
[0019]	 According to Figure 1, only a housing segment 1 of the process section of<br>
the extruder is shown. The process section consists of a plurality of such juxtaposed<br>
housing segments which can be clamped together by pull rods (not shown) guided<br>
through the bores 2 in the housing segment 1.<br>
[0020]	 The conveying direction of the process section is shown by the arrow 3. On<br>
the upstream conveying side of the segment 1 the housing segment (not shown) with<br>
the material inlet opening of the extruder is disposed, and on the downstream<br>
conveying side the housing segment (not shown) with the material outlet opening<br>
thereof.<br>
[0021]	 The process section is formed as a ring extruder, as described e.g. in EP 0<br>
788 867 B1. That is, extending axially through the housing segment 1 and the other<br>
housing segments (not shown) of the process section is an inside core (not shown).<br><br>
-5-<br>
Between the inside core and the housing segments there is an annular space with<br>
axially parallel rotatable shafts extending therein, disposed along a circle at equal<br>
central-angle distance, each of which carries a number of tandem-arranged screw and<br>
other processing elements with which adjacent shafts closely intermesh, the inside core<br>
on the interior side of said space and, as shown in Figure 1, the inside wall of the<br>
housing segments 1 being provided with channel-shaped axially parallel depressions 4<br>
in which the particular shaft with its processing elements is received and guided.<br>
[0022]	 The housing segment 1 shown in Figure 1, disposed between the material<br>
inlet opening and the material outlet opening of the process section, is provided with<br>
an intermediate opening 5 for removing gases from the plastic being processed in the<br>
process section.<br>
[0023]	 For this purpose, the segment 1 has connected thereto an intermediate<br>
housing 6 having two axially parallel screw shafts 7, 8 disposed therein, which are<br>
shown in Figure 2 and extend perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the process<br>
section. Each screw shaft 7, 8 has a short screw element 9, 10 facing the process<br>
section, and a long screw element 11,12 facing away from the process section. The<br>
screw elements 9, 11 and 10, 12 of the two shafts 7, 8 intermesh closely, the<br>
intermediate housing 6 being provided on the inside wall with axially parallel channel-<br>
shaped depressions (not shown) which receive the screw elements 9 to 12 and thus<br>
guide the screw shafts 7, 8. The screw elements 9 to 12 are disposed rotationally fast<br>
on the screw shafts, e.g. by a splining.<br>
[0024]	 The screw shafts 7, 8 extend with their screw elements 9 to 12 from the<br>
intermediate opening 5 in the housing segment 1 of the process section as far as the<br>
gas outlet opening 13 in the intermediate housing 6 through which gases separated<br>
from the plastic in the process section are drawn off.<br>
[0025]	 The screw elements 9, 10 have a direction of thread so as to convey plastic<br>
material penetrating from the process section into the intermediate housing 6 back to<br>
the process section in the direction of the arrow 14. This device is accordingly called<br>
the material retaining device. In contrast, the screws 11,12 have the opposite direction<br>
of thread, thereby causing plastic material reaching the screw elements 11, 12 via the<br><br>
-6-<br>
screw elements 9, 10 to be conveyed away from the process section according to the<br>
arrow 15. Due to the high temperature of the surface of the screw elements 9 to 12 and<br>
the inside wall of the intermediate housing 6, plastic material adhering to these<br>
surfaces for some time is decomposed. While plastic is continually replaced in the area<br>
of the backfeeding screw elements 9,10 and thus decomposition is prevented, plastic<br>
residues reaching the feeding elements 11, 12 are decomposed. The decomposed<br>
plastic residues can either be drawn off through the gas outlet opening 13, or a further<br>
opening (not shown) can be provided on the underside of the intermediate housing 6 in<br>
the area facing away from the process section, through which the plastic residues can<br>
be removed.<br>
[0026]	 In the embodiment according to Figure 2, the screw element 9 on the screw<br>
shaft 7 is of right-hand form and the screw element 11 of left-hand form, while on the<br>
screw shaft 8 the screw element 10 is of left-hand form and the screw element 12 of<br>
right-hand form.<br>
[0027]	 While Figure 2 shows counterrotating screw shafts 7, 8, the screw shafts 7, 8<br>
in Figure 3 are driven in corotating fashion.<br>
[0028]	 Both the screw shafts 7, 8 according to Figure 2 and the screw shafts 7, 8<br>
according to Figure 3 can be formed in one piece with their drive gears 18,19; 20, 21.<br>
[0029]	 As shown in Figure 4, if there are two counterrotating screw shafts 7, 8 a<br>
gear drive can be completely omitted, since the driven screw shaft 8 drives the shaft 7<br>
by the screw elements 10, 12 of the former engaging the screw elements 9,11 of the<br>
latter. This means that in the embodiment according to Figure 4 it is only necessary to<br>
mount the shafts 7, 8 in the split gear box 22.<br>
[0030]	 To seal the process section vacuumtight, the intermediate housing 6 is<br>
flange-mounted vacuumtight laterally on the housing segment 1 according to Figures 1<br>
and 5. Further, the intermediate housing 6 is connected vacuumtight to the split gear<br>
box 22. To reduce heat transfer from the hot intermediate housing 6 to the split gear<br>
box 22, a plate 23 made of thermal insulating material is disposed between opposing<br>
faces of the intermediate housing 6 and the split gear box 22.<br><br>
-7-<br>
[0031]	 The screw shafts 7, 8 of the material retaining device are driven by the<br>
electromotor 24 via a reduction gear 25. The housing 26 connecting the reduction gear<br>
25 to the split gear box is, as apparent from Figures 2 to 4, penetrated only by a shaft<br>
27,28 which can be sealed vacuumtight with a magnetic clutch. While the shaft 27 is<br>
disposed coaxially to the shaft 8 in the embodiment according to Figures 2 and 4 with<br>
counterrotating shafts 7, 8, the shaft 28 in the embodiment according to Figure 3 with<br>
corotating shafts 7, 8 is provided with a gear wheel 29 which meshes with the gear<br>
wheels 20,21 on the shafts 7, 8.<br><br>
