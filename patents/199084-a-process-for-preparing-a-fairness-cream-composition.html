				<td>BACKGROUHD OF THIS I1TVENTIOK:<br>
This invention relates to a composition for preparation of Fairness Cream based on Herbal extract. Herbal origin is preferred to the synthetic ones due to their law toxicity.<br>
The invention in general relates to composition Fairness Cream and more specifically to enhanced whitening of Skin. Melanin the natural pigment of the skin is produced in the melanocytes dendiic cells of the Epidermis within specialised organelles called melanosomes. In addition to its spectral properties [filtration of U.V. radiation], melanin plays a more complex role, it participates in the immune response and defence against free radicals.<br>
According to the current knowledge the colour of the human races are mostly due to the Quantity of "Melanin" present in the melanocytes and in the assemblies called epidermal unit of Melanisation. The biochemical pathways of melanogenesis do not differ from, one ethnic group to another.<br>
Melanin synthesis- is essentially conversion of tyrosine- Amino acid present in the skin to Dihydroxy Phenylanine [DOPAJ, then going through Dopaquinone to Dopachrome and finally to Melanin. Tyrosinase is the key enzyme in these transformations and determines the rate of melanogenesis and therefore the colour of the skin. Any skin whitening substance is therefore conceived as an inhibitor of Tyrosinase. The Melanin synthesis is a key enzyme, tyrosinase, determines the rate of melanogenesis; this enzyme transforms tyrosine, the aromatic amino acid, into dihydroxyphenylalaine (POPA), then, going, through dopaquinone and leucodopchrome, into dopachrome, a slightly red colored molecule and its structural formula is illustrated in Annexure I.<br><br>

It is another objects of the invention to prepare a composition which exhibits additionally a retardation to skin aging.<br>
It is another object of the invention to prepare a composition which additionally prevents skin blemishes.<br>
It is another object of the invention to prepare a composition which additionally improves the skin smoothness and elasticity by working as an effective moisturizer.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE ZHVEHTIOH<br>
The present invention relates to a skin cosmetic composition and more specifically to skin cosmetic composition having the effect of skin whitening.<br>
Accordingly, the invention relates to a cosmetic composition which :-<br>
a.	has tyrosinase inhibitors derived from herbal extracts and alkali metal<br>
derivatives of Ascorbic acid.<br>
b.	Melanocyte pathway regulating agent like Milk Protein Lactokine.<br><br>
*-.<br>
c.	Antioxidant agent like Vitamin E acetale.<br>
d.	U.V. Screen agents - Octylmethoxy Cinnamate for protection from UVB<br>
rays; Butylmethoxy Dibenzoyl Methane (BMDM) for protection from UVA<br>
rays, alongwith Titanium dioxide.<br>
e.	EmcoUiency agent like Silicones.<br>
DE8CRIPTIOH OF THE IHVEJTIOH<br>
According to the present invention, the enhanced quality of the composition is directly based to the herbal extraction and the composition which has been developed.<br>
The composition is now described herein below in its broadest scopes and aspects and the possible variant features and characteristics of the invention are described elongwith equivalent feature and characteristics in the preferred embodiment.<br>
The skin whitening uses two different principles. Said use of the two principles together is a novel development.<br>
1)	Tyrosinase Inhibition and<br>
2)	Regulating melanocyte pathway.<br>
i,     TYROSINASE iraramoH<br>
The skin whitening in the present invention is achieved by using tyrosinase inhibitors derived from herbal Extracts and alkali metal derivative of Ascorbic acid.<br><br>
The composition of the invention includes from 0.01 to 0.1% preferably from 0.02 to 0.05% by weight.<br>
a)	The herbal extracts described herein is the depigmentation complex<br>
composed of four Botanical Extracts selected for their efficacy end the synergy<br>
of their effect, making it a powerful tyrosinase inhibitor. It is slightly cytotoxic<br>
which means depigmentation does not result from the destruction of<br>
melanocytes. The four extracts are as follows :-<br>
1)	SAXIFRAGE EXTRACT (satifmga sttfoniferd}<br>
2)	GRAPE EXTRACT       [iritis vtoLfera}<br>
3)	MULBERRY ROOT EXTRACT {moms nigrti)<br>
4)	SCUTELLARIA ROOT EXTRACT {scuteUaria baiccdensis)<br>
b)	The alkali metal derivative of Ascorbic acid is "Sodium Ascorbyl<br>
Phosphate*. This is converted to free Ascorbic acid or Vitamin C in the skin.<br>
Vitamin C gives skin whiterung by suppressing the formation of melanin<br>
through Tyrosinase inhibition.<br>
Activity of Vitamin C in the skin<br>
•	Antioxidant<br>
Scavenges of aggressive oxidizing agents and free radicals in the skin, cell protection in the skin<br>
•	Increased collagen formation by the cells<br>
•	Skin Whitening<br>
Suppresses the formation of melanin<br>
prevents the formation of freckles and birthmarks,<br>
whitens    dark    skin    or     areas of dark skin<br><br>
Application - skin care<br>
•	Sun screen product<br>
•	Vitamin formulations for daily skin care/Anii-ageing products<br>
•	Skin wiritetmig formulation<br>
Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate is converted to free Vitamin C in the skin<br>
•	Sodium Ascorbyl phosphate penetrates the skin<br>
•	Enzymes (Phosphatases) in the horny layer cleave Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate<br>
•	Vitamin C is released in the skin<br>
The invention is further illustrated in Annexure - n end the structure formula of a sodium ascorbyl phosphate is a stable vitamin C derivative. It also acts as an Antioxidant and scavenges free radicles which cause aging and skin blemishes. Therefore indirectly preventing blemishes and aging of the skin.<br>
Anneiaire VI (A-C) shows the anti-tyrosinase activity of 1% lactokine fluid, 0.01% of Lascorbic acid and .01% of Biowhite.<br>
c) Measurement of anti-tyro*inase activity.<br>
The action of tyrosinase on its substrate Tyrosine leads* to the formation of DOPA, then to Dopachrome. The generation of which can be followed at 475nm with the help of a Spectrophotometer. The inhibitory effect can appear at two different levels- the initiation of enzymatic activity may be delayed^ag time]. The initial rate is thus slowed, or the global activity -quantity of Dopachrome generated may also be affected.<br><br>
The amino acid Tyrosine is transformed into Dihydroxy phenyl alanine [DOPA], into Dopaquinone into Dop a chrome by the Tyrosinase activity. This conversion is recorded with a Spectrophotometer.<br>
Percentage of Inhibition of Tyrosinase by the following :-<br><br>
XL       REGULATIHQ MELAMOCYTIC PATHWAY<br>
MILK PROTEIN-IACTOKINE also causes skin whitening by regulating luelanocytic Patliway and not by inhibiting Tyrosinase.<br>
(see Annexure 111(A).*4 Lactofchie fluid reduces Melanin Synthesis") show that a concentration of 32 mg/ml causes a reduction of the amount of melanin to about 57%. At the same time the activity of arbutin (concentration 10 and 70 JIM) was investigated. The obtained results confirm that this cell culture test system produces results comparable to those cited in literature.<br>
(see Annexure ni(B),* Lactokine fluid lightens the skin") Moreover &gt; the in vivo study revealed that after 4 weeks' application of a formulation containing 5%<br><br>
Lactokine Fluid a significant lightening of the treated areas was observed. This whitening effect was quantified using chroinametric methods. The average value of brightness (L*) of the volunteers from the Philippines was around 54. After 4 weeks the areas treated with Lactokine Fluid showed an L* value of 57 (111(B). ^Lactokine Fluid lightens the Skin"). As Europeans have average L* values between 60 and 65, this increased L* value can be interpreted as skin lightening - produced by Lactokine Fluid.<br>
In vitro investigations using purified tyrosinase showed that - in contrast to arbutin and hydrochinone - the lightening effect was not caused by inhibition of tyrosinase (see 111(C). * Lactokine Fluid does not influence Tyrosinase Activity"). Therefore, it is likely that Lactokine Fluid acts via influencing regulatory uielaiiocytic pathways, By delivering signals for the reduction of melanin synthesis, Lactokine Fluid supports an even skin complexion. For this action the active ingredient needs neither to enter the cell nor to pass the melanosomal membraxice within the cell. Because of the absence of such obstacles Lactokine Fluid can act very efficiently - compared to tyrosinase inhibitors.<br>
Lactokine Fluid is recommended for regenerative care of stressed and agiog skinv for prevention of skin damage and at the same time for providing an even pigmentation of the skin.<br>
Lactokine Fluid - the vitalizing skin balancer.<br>
Lactokine Fluid<br>
Characteristic<br>
Lactokine Fluid contains a network of activated and stabilized signal molecules<br><br>
derived from milk which promote vitalization of the akin protection system and reduction of melanin synthesis,<br>
Bioactivity of Lactokhie Fluid is standardized by cell culture assays.<br>
INCI Name : Milk Protein	CAS No.:    91082-88-1<br>
EU Name : Lactia Protekram	EINECS No. : 293-803-2<br><br>
Biological activity of Lactokhie Fluid is determined by measuring cell vitality in a skin cell line using the MTT as say (MTT « 3-[4,5-dimetJiyltMa2»l-2-yl]-2&gt;5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide). By measuring OD values (OD - optical density) at 590 nmt cell vitality is determined in the presence of 8 nig/ml Lactakine Fluid and 10 % PCS (Petal Calf Serum) respectively.  Biological activity is defined as the quotient of OD<br><br>
values determined in, the presence of Lactokine Fluid and 10 % FCS, respectively.<br>
Physiological toleration<br>
Note : Test protocols refer to the code name *LMP" which is identical with the product Lactokine Fluid<br>
Acute oral toxicity<br>
LDaoin rats : &gt; 2000 mg/kg bodyweight<br>
No significant toxtcological effects could be observed.<br>
Toleration by the mucous membrane of the eye<br>
Lactokine Fluid, undiluted, was tested in accordance with the OECD Guideline No. 405. The classification "minimal irritant" (class 3 out of a score system ranging from 1 to 8) suggests that no symbols or risk phrases are required on the packing.<br>
Acute dermal irritation<br>
Lactokine Fluid, undiluted, was tested in accordance with the OECD Guideline No. 404 where it produced a primary irritation index of 0.0 and hence could be classified as "non-irritantw.<br>
Patch test on humans<br>
A gel containing 5 % Lactokine Fluid, tested on 30 volunteers, produced no<br><br>
erythema, scaling or Assuring. Therefore, with regard to possible skin irritating properties, Lactokine Fluid can be classified as "harmless*.<br>
SenstUsation<br>
Lactokine Fluid, undiluted, was tested in accordance with the "Magnnsson and Kligman Maximisation Study* (OECD Guideline No. 406) where it produced a sensitization rate of 10 % (1/ 10) and hence was classified as "mild sensitiser* for guinea-pig skin. No symbols or risk phrases are required on product packing because Lactokine Fluid did not meet the criteria for a classification as a sensitiser.<br>
Mode of action<br>
Lactokine Fluid minimizes reactions caused by skin irritation, such as release of inflammatory mediators or reduced cell vitality, thereby shortening the time of inflammation and accelerating recovery of the physiological skin condition. As a consequence of this powerful antiinflammatory activity Lactokine Fluid efficiently protects the skin.<br>
Lactokine Fluid was shown to reduce the melanin production of melanocytes ia vitro and in vitro and in vivo. This effect is not produced by inhibition of tyrosinase, but is thought to be due to influences on regulatory melanocyte pathways. By delivering signals for the reduction of melanin synthesis, Lactokine Fluid supports an even skin pigmentation.<br>
Lactokine Fluid rebalances and revitalises stressed skin and furthermore provides for even pigmentation.<br><br>
Application<br>
Lactoktne Fluid is recommencbed for the regenerative caie of stressed and aging skin, for prevention of damage causing premature skin aging, and at the time for enhancing an even pigmentation.<br>
Use<br>
Aqueous and emulsified skin care preparations.<br>
Dosage 2.0-5.0%<br>
Nature<br>
Slightly yellow, opaque solution.<br>
Characteristic odour.<br>
LACTOKIHE FLUID<br>
Several factors can influence the vitality of the skin. Both exogenous and endogenous signals modify epidermal as well as dermal cell activities. On the one hand intrinsic reduction of cellular processes occurs in the course of aging and on the other environmentally induced alterations take place. lACTOKINE FLUID contains a network of activated and stabilized sdgnal molecules derived from milk. Consequently, cells can react on changes very fast and efficiently, thus promoting vitalization of the skin protection system. Therefore, lACTOKINE FLUID helps prevent and ameliorate skin deficiencies.<br>
Skin irritations induce alterations of the bio-balance of the skin causing several changes on the cellular level, such as release of inflammatory mediators or<br><br>
decrease in cell vitality as illustrated in Annexure m |D) and Annexure m (E). IACTOKINE FLUID minimizes these effects. Therefore, it shortens the time of inflammation and accelerates recovering processes in the skin. As a consequence of this powerfiil ani-irritant activity IACTOKINE FLUID efficiently protects the skin.<br>
Another sign of imbalances within the skin is the appearance of an uneven pigmentation. Skin aging, for instance, is often accompanied by the formation of senile spots. These hyperpigmented areas appear due to local increase in melanin synthesis.<br>
IACTOKINE FLUID was shown to reduce the melanin production and was illustrated in annexure 111(B). On the one hand this effect was demonstrated in vitro in cell culture and on the other in vivo on the coloured skin of volunteers from the Philippines. After 4 weeks application of a formulation containing 5% IACTOKINE FLUID a significant lightening of the treated areas was observed. This whitening effect was quantified using chromametric methods.<br>
As in vitro investigations in annexure 111(B) showed that this effect was not caused by inhibitioii of tyrosinase, it is likely that IACTOKINE FLUID acts via influencing regulatory melanocytic pathways. By delivering signals for the reduction of melanin synthesis, IACTOKINE FLUID supports an even skin complexion. For this action the active ingredient needs neither to enter the cell nor to pass the melanosomal membrane within the cell. Because of the absence of such obstacles IACTOKINE FLUID can act very efficiently -compared to tyrosinase inhibitors.<br>
IACTOKINE FLUID is recommended for regenerative care of stressed and aging skin, for prevention of skin damage and at the same time for providing an even<br><br>
pigmentation of the skin.<br>
LACTOKINE FLUID - the vitalising skin balancer.<br>
The invention is further illustrated in Annexure - HE{A) to m(S). The annexure - 111(A) illustrate the decrease of melanin synthesis by lactokine fluid wherein the melanin in (%) related to melanin amounts produced by cells grown in complete medium containing 10% PCS ("100%), The annexure III (C) illustrate the decrease of tyrosinase activity without the influence of lactokine fluid wherein tyrosinase activity related to DOPA amounts synthesized by tyrosinase without inhibitors (=100%). The annexure HI (D) illustrate the lactokine fluid in protecting the skin against a-hydroxy acid induced inflammations wherein the concentration of prostaglandin E2 (ng/pg DNA) (%) after 1 hour related to 100% treated skin. The annexure III (E) illustrate the lactokine fluid in protecting the skin against a-hydroxy acid induced decrease in cell viability wherein the concentration of formazan (\ig/pg DNA) related to 100% treated skin.<br>

Vitamin E<br>
Vitamin E is known for its protector function. The central role of Vitamin E is that of an "in vivo" antioxidant. Just as it is used in edible oils and fats to prevent rancidity, it is incorporated into cosmetic products to protect the skin lipids from decomposition.<br>
Topically applied Vitamin E acetate ( 1% in ethanol) reduce UV-induced lipid peroxidation in the epidermis, UV dose 1 MED. Record 1991 as illustrated in Annexure IV A.<br>
These lipids, important components of the cell membranes are under constant<br><br>
attack from free radicals formed both in the course of normal biological reactions and also from various external factors, such as oxygen, UV light from the sun or the environmental pollutant ozone. A successful attack by these radicals means damage to the skin lipids by peroxidation. Such impairment leads to changes in the structure of the skin. It becomes wrinkled and appears older.<br>
Current research indicates that the extent of peroxidation damage is controlled by antioxidant such as Vitamin E. That Vitamin £ protects the skin lipids from UV damage has been shown by, amongst others, Record (1991). Topical administration of a 1% solution of Vitamin E 1 and 24 hours before irradiation reduced the degree of lipid peroxidation (Annexure IV). Pathak (1998) reported that repeated application of Vitamin E to the skin reduces the number of sunburn cells formed as a consequence of UVB radiation. In 1990 Bisset published the results of a study on the photoprotective effect to topically applied antioxidants. Both Vitamin E and Vitamin C reduced the severity of UV - induced skin wrinkling in hairless mice.<br>
Bioconversion of Vitamin E acetate into tocopherol in the skin. Vitamin E daily applied to hairless mice. Results after 10 days. Norkus 1993. is illustrated in Annemre IV B<br>
In a topically applied product containing sun filters and Vitamin E, the filters absorb or scatter the UV rays on the surface of the skin. Vitamin E, however, acts on the inner surface of the skin. It prevents the formation of free radicals in both epidermis and dermis.<br>
The invention is further illustrated in Annexure - IV A &amp; IV B.<br><br>
)<br>
SUIT SCREENS :<br>
Solar radiation's ranging from 200nm-780nm wave lengths, apart from having beneficial effects also they have harmful effect on the skin leading sometimes to cancer. Therefore it is important to protect the skin and minimise the solar radiations reaching the skin. This is effected by Sunscreens. Ultra Violet radiations that affect the skin have the following wave lengths:<br>
1.	UVA- Long Wave UV radiations ranging from 320nm-400nm with a broad peak. At 340nm,it is this radiation that causes redness and extensive skin damage.<br>
2.	UVB- Shorter Wave UV radiation ranging from 290nm-320nm with a broad peak. At 31 lnm these radiations cause Erythma Sun burn and irritation.<br>
3.	UVC- Is a very short Wave UV radiation ranging from 200nm-290nm.This is largely filtered by the Ozone of the atmosphere and therefore does not show much skin damage.<br>
Two types of Sunscreens are in vogue today :-<br>
1)	Chemical Sunscreens that absorb the sun's radiations e.g. Octylmethoxy Cinnamate, Octocrylene, Benzophenone3t Ben2»phenone43utyl-Methoxy-dibenzoyl-methane.<br>
2)	Physical Sunscreens that scatter the Solar Radiations from. 290nm-77Gnm wave length e.g. Titanium dioxide and Zinc Oxide.<br>
Skin that is lightened by controlling melanin formation is prone to darkening by Solar Radiations and hence must be protected by sunscreens.<br>
The Sunscreens that have been chosen for protection are Chemical and<br><br>
Physical Sunscreens Octylmethoxy Cinnamate for protection from UVB rays. Butylmethoxy dibenzoyl methane(BMDM) for protection from UVA rays.<br>
Both these Chemical Sunscreens are unstable to radiations. We have stabilised both these Sunscreens with a Physical Sunscreen- Titanium dioxide , which apart from Scattering Sun's Radiation's from 290nm- 770nm,thus giving protection to the Skin also reduces degradation of Octylmethoxy Cinnamate and Butylmethoxy dibenzoyl methane and makes them relatively safe by reducing the degradation products formed from Photooxidation.<br>
Vitamin E acetate lias also been added to the Sunscreens to improve the protector function. By virtue of its antioxidant properties thus reducing the risk of damage that could be caused by radiations passing through the Sunscreen barrier. The invention is further illustrated by the preferred embodiment in Annexure - VIZ. It describes the effect of TL02 on photostability of Octylmethoxycinnainate, based on in-vitro absorbance measurements at 310 nm and the effect of Ti02 on photostability of Butylmethoxydibenzoyl methane, based on in-vitro absorbance measurements at 355 nm. The Annexure - VII explains the<br>
role of -  Octylmethoxy cinnamate with Titanium dioxide and Vitamin E role of-  Butylmethoxy  dibenzoyl  methane  with  Titanium   dioxide   and Vitamin E And the stabilised sunscreen is achieved in the invention<br>
EMOLLIEHCY<br>

As per the present invention, a cosmetic composition* which has better skin whitening effect, and which is relatively safe is obtained. The typical composition is :-<br>
Herbal Extract with depigmentation complex	0.01 - 0.1%<br>
Milk Protein with Peptides	0.10 - 5.0%<br>
Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate	0.02 - 3.0%<br>
A typical example of Herbal extract, with depigmentation complex is Biowhite. The invention is further illustrated in Annexure - VA &amp; V B. It Illustrates a comparative evaluation by visible spectrum UV spectrophotometry of aiiti-tyrosinase activity of Bio white on the formation of dopachrome from L-dopa. At a concentration of 0.02 % a depigmentation complex such as Biowhite can<br><br>
give 46 % inhibition. At a concentration of 1 % it can enable 97 % inhibition of tyrosinase activity. Assessment on human skin explants treated with L-DOPA to induce the appearance of black pre-melanic pigments where in the basal mexnbrane(a) the melanocytes is filled with (black) melanic pigment. At 0.1%, Biowhite (b) totally inhibits the histo-chemical reaction.<br>
BIOWHTTE<br>
Description<br>
Depigmentation complex composed of 5 botanical extracts selected for their efficacy and the synergy of their effects. Powerful tyrosinase inhibitor, extremely stable if variations in pH and temperature occur, BIOWHITE is very slightly cytotoxic(this means that depigmentation does not result from the destruction of the melanocytes.<br>
