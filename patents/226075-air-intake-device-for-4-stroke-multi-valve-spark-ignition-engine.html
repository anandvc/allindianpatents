				<td>AIR   INTAKE   DEVICE   FOR   4-STROKE   MULTI   VALVE   SPARK IGNITION ENGINE<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to an air intake system for a multi-intake valve 4-stroke spark ignition engine. More particularly, the present invention relates to a secondary throttle intake for a 4-stroke multi valve single or multi cylinder spark ignition engine used for two-wheeled vehicle applications. Background of the invention<br>
It is known in the art that engine performance of four stroke engines are influenced by the number of valves per cylinder, the valve opening area, the valve timings and the geometry of the intake and exhaust ports. The present trend in use four stroke engines to obtain more power form a given swept volume of an engine is to introduce multivalves for the intake and exhaust system. Variable speed automobile engines work over a wide speed range. Conventional engine systems are tuned around the speed corresponding to maximum torque or power in the system. In such systems, the part load fuel econorny, emission and throttle response are compromised. For example, when the engine is tuned for, good part load fuel economy, by compromising on the peak torque, the drivabilitiy of the vehicle is compromised. Work is underway to improve variable valve timing systems in order to achieve optimum engine performance in the engine operating range. However, such systems that have been developed in the art are complicated and not commercially available.<br><br>
Work has also been done on intake induction device to improve the torque over a wide speed range. US Patent 4,232,640 discloses an induction system for an internal combustion engine with variable induction volume chambers where the auxiliary induction passage is comparatively smaller in cross section than the main induction passage.

Figure    5    is    a    graph    showing    the    fuel    consumption characteristics at road load. Detailed Description of the invention<br>
In the present invention, the airflow to the engine is through two different independent intake ports/ ducts and valves per cylinder in a four-stroke multi valve engine. Towards upstream side, both these<br>
passages are connected to the air box through main passage and where the main throttle valve is fitted. At the low throttle opening of the main throttle valve, the secondary throttle valve is closed and partially opens at mid-load range and allows air to be inducted inside the combustion chamber through one valve, relatively at a higher velocity and swirl. This permits the establishment of high turbulence in the chamber at the time of combustion to improve the flame propagation and combustion, thus improving fuel consumption and lowering the emission. This is accomplished without the sacrifice of power output and volumetric efficiency due to the use of two inlet valves for air induction.<br>
In the present invention, the intake air amount is increased over a wider operating range. At low load, the inlet duct is closed since the secondary throttle does not operate. At part load, where the air intake required is small, this is achieved due to the higher intake velocity/inertia supercharging due to the closing of one inlet valve duct in the multi intake valve engine. This also increases the tumble/swirl thereby improving the combustion. At full load, all the inlet valves are open thereby achieving higher combustion and higher intake of air.<br>
The engine operates with one intake valve closed at low fuel loads and partially open at mid-loads thereby ensuring better thermal efficiency, smoother combustion, and low emissions. At higher loads and speeds, all the intake valve ducts are open thereby ensuring better drivability and pick up of the engine.<br>
The invention will now be explained with reference to the drawings accompanying the specification where Figure 1 is an exploded view of the secondary throttle valve of the rotary type. Figure 2 shows the use of a butterfly type valve for the secondary throttle valve in place of a rotary valve.<br>
The air intake device comprises of a primary throttle (12) and a secondary throttle (1). The secondary throttle (1) is provided in an intake port or in the intake port extension body of the engine (not shown) after the main throttle (12). The main throttle can be the carburetor throttle. The secondary throttle is constructed such that when fully open, the air flow is not obstructed thereby enabling smooth air passage. A bracket (6) is provided connected to the body (3) by means of an 'O' ring (2). A stopper pin (4) is screwed on to the secondary throttle (1) through a slit in the bracket (6). The secondary throttle (1) is retained in the closed position at very low loads of fuel by means of a helical spring (5). At mid-loads or high loads, the secondary throttle (1) is rotated by means of the stopper pin (4) which is pushed by a disc (7) provided on the bracket (6). The position of the secondary throttle is adjusted in operation by means of a secondary throttle adjusting screw (8) provided on the disc (7). The secondary throttle (1) is actuated by an actuation means (11) which comprises inter alia a cable (10) which passes through the disc (7) and is connected to the main throttle (12). The inner cable (10) passing through the disc (7) is provided with a clamp (9) at a predefined distance. When the inner cable (10) is actuated through the throttle<br>
actuation means (11), the clamp (9) moves freely inside the slot provided on the disc (7). The free travel of the clamp (9) inside the disc corresponds to the movement of the throttle (1) under part fuel load condition. The clamp (9) rotates the disc (7) thereby rotating the secondary throttle (1) corresponding to predetermined position of the main throttle (12). Thus the amount of air intake during part fuel load conditions is regulated. At the throttle wide open position, the main throttle and the secondary throttle are both fully open.<br>
The secondary throttle is operated through either mechanical connection with the main throttle or through pneumatic pressure actuated by the vacuum in the intake manifold. The exact position of the secondary throttle is displayed on the instrument panel through conventional indication means such as light emitting diodes or electrical bulbs.<br>
Figures 3 and 4 show schematic representations of the air intake device with a rotary type valve and a butterfly type valve respectively as the secondary throttle valve, and the interconnections between the air intake device of the invention and the engine. The internal combustion engine includes a cylinder block (16) with a plurality of cylinder bores (17). The piston (15) slides between the bores (17) and delivers power to the crankshaft (not shown) through general arrangements of connecting rod. The cylinder head (18) is fixed to cylinder bore (17) with a plurality of combustion chambers (19). The piston (15), cylinder bore (17) and combustion chamber (19) provide a variable volume in the combustion chamber where the<br>
combustion occurs. The spark plug (21) is positioned inside the combustion chamber to ignite the combustible mixture in a known manner. When the exhaust valve (14) opens, exhaust gases are expelled in to the atmosphere through the exhaust passage (20).<br>
The multi intake passage (22) and (23) per cylinder are connected to the combustion chamber through inlet valves (13) of the respective cylinder in a known manner for delivering the air fuel charge to respective combustion chambers (19).<br>
Referring now specifically to figure 3, the secondary throttle valve (1- of the rotary type, la - butterfly type) is provided in one of the intake ports or intake port extension body (3) downstream of the main throttle valve (12). The main throttle valve may be a carburetor throttle (12). The secondary throttle valve (1, la) is constructed such that when it is fully open it does not obstruct the airflow and provides a smooth air passage.<br>
The secondary throttle valve (la) can be of a butterfly type as shown in figure 4 and is connected to the main throttle valve with a suitable mechanism fulfilling the criterion that at low load secondary throttle valve (la) remains closed and partially open at pre-defined position, as explained above<br>
The secondary throttle valve (1) can be operated through the pneumatic mechanism actuated by the vacuum in the intake manifold.<br>
At idling and low loads, when the secondary throttle valve (1) (la) is closed, the air or air fuel mixture is inducted into the<br>
combustion chamber through one valve instead of two or more intake valves in to the combustion chamber, relatively at a higher velocity and swirl. This permits the establishment of high turbulence in the chamber at the time of combustion to improve the flame propagation and combustion, thus improving the fuel consumption and lowering the emission. This is accomplished without the sacrifice of power output and volumetric efficiency due to the use of two inlet valves for air induction.<br>
In Figure 5 curve 'A' shows the brake specific fuel consumption without the air intake device of the invention and curve 13' with the air intake device of the invention device in operation. With the said device, lower specific fuel consumption at low loads/road load condition has been achieved.<br>
Position of the secondary throttle valve (1) can be displayed on the instrument panel through light emitting diodes or electrical bulbs.<br><br><br><br><br>
