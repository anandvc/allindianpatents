WO 02/085869 describes substituted arylsulfonamides as antiviral agents, especially against cytomegaloviruses.<br>
One object of the present invention is to provide new compounds with equal or improved antiviral activity, improved pharmacokinetics, especially a longer half-life and/or improved oral bioavailability, whose metabolic degradation pathways do not differ significantly between human and usual tox-species, such as rat and dog, for the treatment of viral infectious diseases in humans and animals.<br>
Surprisingly it has been found that the substituted arylsulfonamides described in the present invention have antiviral activity, show improved pharmacokinetical properties and that their metabolic degradation pathways do not differ significantly in humans, rats and dogs.<br>
The invention relates to compounds of formula<br><br><br><br>
in which<br>
A        represents a group of formula<br><br>
whereby<br>
*	is the linkage site to the carbon atom of the pyridinyl ring,<br>
and<br>

The invention accordingly relates to the enantiomers or diastereomers and their respective mixtures. From such mixtures of enantiomers and/or diastereomers it is possible to isolate the stereoisomerically uniform constituents, in a known way.<br>
Where the compounds of the invention can occur in tautomeric forms, the present invention includes all of the tautomeric forms.<br>

Administration forms suitable for parenteral administration are, inter alia, preparations for injection and infusion in the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsions, lyophilisates or sterile powders.<br>
Examples suitable for the other administration routes include pharmaceutical forms for inhalation (inter alia powder inhalers, nebulizers), nasal drops, solutions, sprays; tablets, films/wafers or capsules, which can be administered lingually, sublingually or buccally, suppositories, preparations for ears or eyes, vaginal capsules, aqueous suspensions (lotions, shaking mixtures), lipophilic suspensions, ointments, creams, transdermal therapeutic systems, milk, pastes, foams, dusting powders, implants or stents.<br>
The compounds of the invention can be converted into the stated administration forms. This can take place in a manner known per se by mixing with inert, non-toxic, pharmaceu-tically acceptable excipients. These excipients include, inter alia, carriers (for example microcrystalline cellulose, lactose, mannitol), solvents (e.g. liquid polyethylene glycols), emulsifiers and dispersants or wetting agents (for example sodium dodecyl sulfate, poly-oxysorbitan oleate), binders (for example polyvinylpyrrolidone), synthetic and natural polymers (e.g. albumin), stabilizers (e.g. antioxidants such as ascorbic acid), colors (for example inorganic pigments such as iron oxides) or taste- and/or odor-corrigents.<br>
The present invention further relates to medicaments which comprise at least one compound of the invention, usually together with one or more inert, non-toxic, pharmaceuti-cally acceptable excipients, as well as to their use for the afore-mentioned purposes.<br>
It has generally proved advantageous to administer on intravenous administration amounts of about 0.001 to 10 mg/kg, preferably about 0.01 to 5 mg/kg, of body weight to achieve effective results, and the dosage on oral administration is about 0.01 to 25 mg/kg, preferably 0.1 to 10 mg/kg, of body weight.<br>
It may nevertheless be necessary where appropriate to deviate from the amounts mentioned, specifically as a function of body weight, administration route, individual response to the active ingredient, type of preparation and time or interval over which administration takes place. Thus it may be sufficient in some cases to make do with less than the aforementioned minimum amount, whereas in other cases the upper limit mentioned must be exceeded. In the event of an administration of larger amounts it may be advisable to divide these into a plurality of individual doses over the day.<br><br>

B.        Assessment of the physiological activity<br>
The in vitro activity of the compounds of the invention can be shown in the following assays:<br>
Anti-HCMV (anti-human cvtomegalovirus) cytopathogenicitv tests<br>
The test compounds are employed as 50 millimolar (mM) solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Ganciclovir® serves as reference compound. After the addition of 2 ul of the 50, 5, 0.5 and 0.05 mM DMSO stock solutions respectively to 98 ul portions of cell culture medium in row 2 A-H for duplicate determinations, 1:2 dilutions are carried out with 50 ul portions of medium up to row 11 of the 96-well plate. The wells in rows 1 and 12 each contain 50 ul of medium. 150 ul of a suspension of 1 x 104 cells (human prepuce fibroblasts [NHDF]) are then pipetted into each of the wells (row 1 = cell control) and, in rows 2-12, a mixture of HCMV-infected and uninfected NHDF cells (M.O.I. - 0.001 -0.003), i.e. 1-3 infected cells per 1000 uninfected cells. Row 12 (without substance) serves as virus control. The final test concentrations are 250 - 0.0005 µM. The plates are incubated at 37°C/5% CO2 for 6 days, i.e. until all the cells in the virus controls are infected (100% cytopathogenic effect [CPE]). The wells are then fixed and stained by the addition of a mixture of formalin and Giemsa's dye (30 min), washed with bidistilled water and dried in a drying oven at 50°C. The plates are then assessed visually using an overhead microscope (plaque multiplier from Technomara).<br>
The following data can be obtained from the test plates:<br>
CC50 (NHDF) = substance concentration in uM at which no visible cytostatic effects on the cells are evident in comparison with the untreated cell control;<br>
EC50 (HCMV) = substance concentration in uM which inhibits the CPE (cytopathic effect) by 50% in comparison with the untreated virus control;<br>
SI (selectivity index) = CC50 (NHDF) / EC50 (HCMV).<br>
Representative in vitro activity data for the compounds of the invention are shown in Table A:<br>
Table A<br><br><br>
The suitability of the compounds of the invention for the treatment of HCMV infections can be shown in the following animal model:<br>
HCMV Xenograft Gelfoam® model<br>
Animals:<br>
5-6-week-old immunodeficient mice (16-20 g), Fox Chase SCID.NOD or NOD.CB17-Prkdc/J, are obtained from commercial breeders (Taconic M&amp;B, Denmark; Jackson, USA). The animals are kept under sterile conditions (including bedding and feed) in isolators.<br>
Virus growing:<br>
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), Davis or AD 169 strain, is grown in vitro on human embryonic prepuce fibroblasts (NHDF cells). After the NHDF cells have been infected with a multiplicity of infection (M.O.I.) of 0.01-0.03, the virus-infected cells are harvested 5-10 days later and stored in the presence of minimal essential medium (MEM), 20% foetal calf serum (FCS) (v/v), 1% glutamine (v/v), 1% Pen/Strep (v/v) with 10% DMSO at -80°C. After serial ten-fold dilution of the virus-infected cells, the titre is determined on 24-well plates of confluent NHDF cells after fixing and staining with a Giemsa formaldehyde solution.<br>
Preparation of the sponges, transplantation, treatment and evaluation:<br>
Collagen sponges lxlxl cm in size (Gelfoam®; Peasel &amp; Lorey, order no. 407534; K. T. Chong et al., Abstracts of 39th Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, 1999, p. 439) are initially wetted with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the trapped air bubbles are removed by degassing, and then stored in MEM, 10% FCS (v/v),<br><br>
For the work-up the samples are thawed. The plasma proteins are subsequently precipitated by the addition of acetonitrile which comprises an internal standard. As internal standard a substance from the same structural class is selected which is structurally as similar as possible to the active compound. For the preparation of calibration samples different concentrations of the active substance are added to aliquots of empty plasma and these are worked up together with the unknown samples. Additionally quality control samples with three different concentrations are prepared which serve to validate the analytical procedure.<br>
The determination of the active substance in the samples takes place by high performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometrical detection (LC/MS-MS). The active substance concentrations in the unknown samples are determined based on their relative peak heights or areas compared to the calibration curve using the program Concalc for Windows (CCW, Integrierte Labordatensysteme, version 2.5 or later, Bayer AG). Subsequently, the pharmacokinetical parameters are calculated from the plasma concentration development over time individualized to an animal using non-compartimental analysis with the aid of the program KINCALC, version 2.50.02 (Bayer AG, 2001).<br>
Compounds which show the desired improved pharmacokinetical profile in the rat are subsequently subjected to a pharmacokinetical investigation after administration to mice and dogs. Based on all this data, a first estimate of the human pharmacokinetics is performed by an interspecies upscaling according to Boxenbaum.<br><br>
The following data can be acquired from these tests:<br>
Vss = distribution volume;<br>
CL = speed of elimination;<br>
t1/2 = half-life;<br>
AUC = total area under the drug-concentration over time curve;<br>
Cmax = maximum concentration;<br>
F = bioavailability;<br>
Pharmacokinetical data for the compound of example 1 after a single intravenous and oral administration to male Wistar rats (n = 3 per time point or n = 3, resp.) are displayed in table B. The compounds of the invention show an improved pharmacokinetical behaviour.<br><br>

Identification of metabolites<br>
Species differences in the metabolism of an active compound can have a large influence on its developability. It is an aim to find substances which do not differ significantly in the metabolic degradation pathways between humans and usual tox species such as for example rat and dog. For this new active substances are first incubated in vitro with liver microsomes of rat, dog and human in order to compare the phase I metabolism. Subsequently, the still interesting compounds are additionally incubated in hepatocytes of rat and<br><br>
human in order to obtain a complete hepatic phase I and phase II metabolism and to compare it.<br>
All new active compounds are incubated in a concentration of 20 uM. For this stock solutions with a concentration of 2 mM in acetonitrile are prepared which are then pipetted into the incubation batch with a 1:100 dilution in order to have a maximum 1% of acetonitrile in the batch. The liver microsomes are incubated at 37°C in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 with and without NADPH-generating system, consisting of 1 mM NADP+, 10 mM glucose-6-phosphate and 1 unit of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Primary hepatocytes are also incubated at 37°C in suspension in Williams E medium. After an incubation time of 0-4 h the incubation batches are stopped with acetonitrile (final concentration about 30%) and the protein is centrifuged off at about 15000 x g. The samples stopped this way are either analyzed directly or stored at -20°C until the analysis.<br>
Analysis takes place using high performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet and mass spectrometrical detection (HPLC-UV-MS). For this, the supernatants of the incubation samples are chromatographed using suitable C18 reversed phase columns and variable mixtures of acetonitrile and 10 mM ammonium formate. The UV-chromatograms in connection with the mass spectrometrical data serve to identify the metabolites. The metabolite profiles of the respective investigated species generated this way are compared and serve to identify species differences.<br><br>
