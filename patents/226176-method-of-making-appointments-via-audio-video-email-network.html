computers. For-example, a word processor is specially designed for word<br>
processing, a calendar for making appointments and a short message for<br>
communications, etc.<br>
As to the calendar, the calendar function provided by current computers is no<br>
longer a bare-bones model, but is a multifunctional scheduling system that can<br>
store several appointments or events. For example, the scheduling system can<br>
automatically remind users about the time of a particular appointment without<br>
requiring any checking from the user side. Further, the scheduling system can<br>
work, together with a directory to remind users about the birthdays of their<br>
families and friends in advance without requiring any special input by users.<br>
In the prior an R.O.C. (Republic of China) Pat. No. 536675 entitled "Calendar<br>
scheduling system and method" discloses a method and a system for making<br>
appointments that allow users to input, a plurality of appointment elements for<br>
analysis and sorting, and provide users a sorted result for their reference.<br><br>
Further R.O.C. (Republic of China) Pat. No. 563046 entitled "Method of<br>
displaying schedules and actions-to-do on a main screen of an operating system<br>
of an electronic device" discloses a method of displaying appointments and<br>
actions-to-do on a main screen of an operating system of an electronic device,<br>
and the electronic device installs an appointment control system connected to<br>
an operating system, such that after the electronic device is turned on, a central<br>
processing; unit of the electronic device can read the appointments and<br>
actions-to-do set by the appointment control system through the operating a<br>
system, and can use the main screen of the operating system to display the item<br>
or number of the appointments and actions-to-do on a liquid crystal display of<br>
the electronic device. Therefore, users can use the main screen of the operating<br>
system to know about the item or number of the appointments and actions-to-do<br>
easily and carry out the appointments and actions-to-do in a timely manner.<br>

Referring to Figs. 1A and 1B, for flow charts of a method of making<br>
appointments via audio/video email network from the sender' s viewpoint<br>
according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, and Figs. 1C to<br>
1H. for flow charts of a method of making appointments via audio/video email<br>
network from the receiver s viewpoint, according to a preferred embodiment<br>
of the present invention, a sender sends an audio/video email having at least<br>
one appointment to at least one receiver. The method is described as having<br>
the following steps.<br>
A sender starts an audio/video email network scheduling software the<br>
audio/video email comprises at least one instant image. data and at least one<br>
instant sound data, and the instant image refers to the sender's image or<br>
handwritten image (S100). The sender prepares an audio/video email for an<br>
appointment within a selected time, and the preparation is achieved by an<br>
image acquisition device and a voice access device (S102). Referring to a<br>
schematic view of a screen as shown in Fig. 1C. a sender selects a plurality of<br><br>
desired receivers from a user name list; the user name list includes a plurality<br>
of user names, a plurality of user phone numbers, a plurality of user mailing<br>
addresses and a plurality of user email addresses. Referring to a schematic<br>
view of a screen as shown in Fig. 1D, the sender presses the confirm key after<br>
selecting the desired receivers (S104).<br>
The audio/video email of the network appointment is sent, and the selected<br>
receivers are notified (S106); the sending object can be a member's email<br>
address or a non-member's email address, and the sending process is via a<br>
cable or a wireless Internet. By that time, the receivers receive the<br>
audio/video email of the network appointment.<br>
Referring to Fig. 2A for the procedure performed at the receiving ends, the<br>
sender receives the receiver's reply message (S108). In the meantime, the<br>
sending end also displays a list of available appointments as shown in Fig. II.<br>
so that the sender can have a better control of the reply situation. The list of<br>
available appointments is displayed upon an inquiry at the receiving end. If the<br>
reply message is in the form of a default standard text (S110), then the<br>
receiver's scheduling of an appointment is displayed (S112), or the receiver's<br>
refusal to schedule an appointment is displayed (S114). If the receiver's<br>
scheduling of the appointment is displayed as described in step (S112), then the<br>
appointment will be added automatically into the audio/video email network<br>
scheduling software at the sending ends and the receiving ends (S116).<br>
Referring to Fig. 1E for the schematic view of the screen, the message for<br>
the appointment made is displayed at the sending ends and the receiving ends<br>
(S118). In Fig. 1F, the schematic view of the screen shows that the<br><br>
appointment is accepted and the wording is put into the audio/video email<br>
scheduling program. If the received reply message is in the form of an<br>
audio/video email (S120). then the receiver's scheduling of an appointment is<br>
displayed and the audio/video description is added (S122) or the receiver's<br>
scheduling of an appointment is displayed and the appointment time is changed<br>
(S124), or the receiver's refusal to schedule an appointment and an audio/video<br>
description is added (S126), and the schematic view of the audio/video<br>
description screen is shown in Fig. 1H. If the receiver's scheduling of an<br>
appointment is displayed and the audio/video description is added (S122), then<br>
the appointment will be added automatically into the audio/video email<br>
network scheduling software at the sending ends and the receiving ends (S128).<br>
Referring to Fig. 1E for the schematic view of the screen, the message of<br>
making the appointment for the senders and receivers is displayed (S130).<br>
Referring to Fig. 1F for the schematic view of the screen, the message, "Your<br>
appointment is accepted and input into the audio/video email network<br>
scheduling software", is displayed<br>
If the receivers schedule an appointment but change the appointment time<br>
(S124), the following steps are also included. The sender agrees to the<br>
appointment (S132), the sender agrees to the appointment and adds an<br>
audio/video description (S134), the sender agrees to the appointment but needs<br>
to change to the appointment time (S136), the sender refuses the appointment<br>
(S138), or the sender refuses the appointment and adds an audio/video<br>
description (S140). If the sender agrees to the appointment (S132) or the<br>
sender agrees to the appointment and adds an audio/video description (S134) in<br><br>
reply to the receiving ends, then the appointment will be added automatically<br>
into the audio/video email network scheduling software at the sending ends and<br>
receiving ends (S128). Referring to Fig. 1E for the schematic view of the<br>
screen, the message of making the appointment for the senders and receivers is<br>
displayed (S130). Referring to Fig. 1F for the schematic view of the screen,<br>
the message, "Your appointment is accepted and input into the audio/video<br>
email network scheduling software", is displayed. In the step of adding the<br>
appointment, a reminder symbol corresponding to the appointment is produced<br>
in the audio/video email network scheduling software at the sending ends and<br>
the receiving ends.<br>
If the sender agrees to the appointment bur needs to change the<br>
appointment time (S136), then the procedure returns to step (S100) as shown in<br>
Fig. 1A and carries out the subsequent steps.<br>
If the sender refuses the appointment (S138). then the sender wil! send out<br>
a standard text for the refusal (S142). As shown in Fig. 1G, the schematic<br>
view of the screen shows the message, "Please be advised that your<br>
appointment is not accepted."<br>
If the sender refuses the appointment and adds an audio/video description<br>
(S140), the audio/video description will be sent to the receivers (S168).<br>
Referring to Figs. 2A and 2B for the flow charts of a method of making<br>
appointments via audio/video email network from the receiver's view point<br>
according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a receiver<br>
receives at least one audio/video email message from at least one sender, and<br>
the procedure includes a step of receiving an audio/video email and<br><br>
appointment screen message (S100). The screen message is shown in Fig.<br>
1H. Receipt of the email is achieved by a cable or a wireless Internet, and<br>
the audio/video email includes at least one instant image data, at least one<br>
instant sound data, and an appointment screen. The instant image is an image<br>
from the sender. The receiver opens and reviews the content of the<br>
audio/video email (S102). and then the receiver determines whether or not to<br>
accept the appointment contained in the sender's audio/video email (S104).<br>
In step (S104) for the receiver to determine whether or not to accept the<br>
appointment contained in the sender's audio/video email, if the determination<br>
result is affirmative, then the confirmation for the content of the audio/video<br>
email is selected. (S106). If the confirmation is in the form of a standard text,<br>
then a default standard text for the acceptance is sent to the senders (S108).<br>
Referring to Fig. IF for the schematic view of the screen, the message, "Your<br>
appointment is accepted and input into the audio/video email network<br>
scheduling software", is displayed, and then an appointment is added to the<br>
audio/video email network scheduling software at the sending ends and<br>
receiving ends (S116). Referring to Fig. 1E for the schematic view of the<br>
screen, the step of inputting the appointment also includes a step of producing a<br>
reminder symbol corresponding to the appointment in the audio/video email<br>
network scheduling software at the sending end or the receiving ends.<br>
If the determination result is negative, then a refusal of the audio/video<br>
email is selected (S120). If the refusal is in the form of a standard text for the<br>
refusal, then the default standard text for the refusal is displayed and sent to the<br>
sender (S122). Referring to Fig. 1G for the schematic view of the screen, the<br><br>
message, "Please be advised that your appointment is refused", is displayed.<br>
If the refusal is in the form of an audio/video message for refusal, then the<br>
content of the audio/video message for refusal is prepared and sent to the<br>
sender (S124). and the results of Step (S122) and (S124) are sent to the senders<br>
(S126).<br>
In step (S106) of selecting the confirmation for the content of the<br>
audio/video email, if the confirmation is in the form of an audio/video message,<br>
then the receiver will execute the change to another appointment (S112). or the<br>
receiver agrees to the appointment and adds an audio/video description (S114).<br>
If step (S112) for changing an appointment is executed, then the receiver<br>
will reply. Referring to Fig. 2B for the reply procedure and the following<br>
procedure, the receiver runs an audio/video email network scheduling software<br>
(S128); the audio/video email includes at least one instant image data, at least<br>
one set of sound data, and an appointment screen, and the instant image is the<br>
receiver image. In the process of a receiver preparing an audio/video email by<br>
selecting an appointment time for a network appointment (S130), the<br>
preparation process is achieved by an image acquisition device and a voice<br>
access device and an appointment screen is integrated into a transmitted<br>
audio/video appointment message. Referring to Fig. 1C for the schematic<br>
view of the screen, the receiver selects a plurality of senders from a user name<br>
list (S132); the user name list includes a plurality of user names, a plurality of<br>
user phone numbers, a plurality of user mailing addresses, and a plurality of<br>
email add addresses. Referring to Fig. 1D for the schematic view of a screen,<br>
the receiver just presses the confirm key after selecting the desired senders, so<br><br>
as to send an audio/video email notifying the selected senders of the network<br>
appointment (S134); the step of sending email is achieved by a cable or a<br>
wireless Internet.<br>
In step (S134) of sending an audio/video email notifying the selected<br>
senders of the network appointment, a reply procedure is simultaneously<br>
carried out at the sending ends. Referring to Fig. 1B and the procedure, the<br>
sender determines whether or not to accept the receiver's change of<br>
appointment included in the audio/video email (S144). If yes, then a<br>
confirmation for the content of the audio/video email is displayed (S1 46); if the<br>
confirmation is in the form of a standard text message, then a default standard<br>
text message for acceptance is sent to the receivers (S148). Referring to Fig.<br>
1F for the schematic view of the screen, the message. "Your appointment is<br>
accepted and input into the audio'video email network scheduling software", is<br>
displayed, the appointment is input into the audio'video email network<br>
scheduling software at the sending ends and receiving ends (S156), and the<br>
messages about inputting the appointment at the sending ends and the receiving<br>
ends are displayed (S1 58). Referring to Fig. 1E for the schematic view of the<br>
screen, the step of inputting the appointment further includes a step of<br>
producing an appointment symbol corresponding to the appointment in the<br>
audio/video email network scheduling software at the sending ends or the<br>
receiving ends.<br>
In step (S1 46) of selecting a confirmation for the content of the audio/video<br>
email, if the confirmation is in the form of an audio/video message, then the<br>
appointment date is changed (S152), or the sender agrees to the appointment<br><br><br>
and adds an audio/video description (S1 54). If the confirmation is in the form<br>
of an audio/video message and another appointment is scheduled (S1 52), then<br>
the procedure returns to Step (S100) as shown in Fig. 1A and the subsequent<br>
procedures are carried out. The sender prepares the audio/video description<br>
and the graphic description message for the selected appointment, and sends<br>
the descriptions to the receivers. Referring to Fig. 1C, if the sender agrees to<br>
the appointment and adds an audio/video description (S154), then the<br>
appointment will be added automatically into the audio/video email network<br>
scheduling software at the sending ends and receiving ends (S156). Referring<br>
to Fig. 1E for the schematic view of the screen, the messages of inputting the<br>
appointment into the sending ends and the receiving ends are displayed.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1F for the schematic view of the screen, the message, "Your<br>
appointment is accepted and input into the audio/video email network<br>
scheduling software", is displayed.<br>
In the process for the sender to determine whether or not to accept another<br>
appointment according to the content of the receiver's audio/video email<br>
(S144), if the result is no, then a refusal for the transmitted audio/video email is<br>
selected (S160). If the refusal is a default standard text message for the<br>
refusal, then the default standard text message for the refusal is displayed and<br>
sent to the receivers (S162). Referring to Fig. 1G for the schematic view of a<br>
screen, the message, "Please be advised that your appointment is refused", is<br>
displayed. If the refusal is in the form of an audio/video message for the<br>

are sent to the receivers (S166).<br>
The receiver receives the sender's replay message (S136). In the<br>
meantime, a list of available appointments is displayed at the receiving ends as<br>
shown in the schematic view of the screen of Fig. 11 Therefore, the receiver<br>
can control the reply situation much more easily. Further, the list of available<br>
appointments is provided upon the request made at the receiving ends. If the<br>
received reply message is in the form of a default standard text for acceptance<br>
(S138), then the sender's scheduling of an appointment is displayed (S140). or<br>
the sender's refusal to schedule an appointment is displayed (S142). If the<br>
sender's scheduling of an appointment is displayed (S140), then the<br>
appointment will be added automatically into the audio/video email network<br>
scheduling software at the receiving ends and the sending ends (S144).<br>
Referring to Fig. 1E for the schematic view of a screen, the messages of the<br>
appointment input at the receiving ends and sending ends (S146) are displayed.<br>

input into the audio/video email network scheduling software", is displayed.<br>
During the step of inputting the appointment, a reminder symbol corresponding<br><br><br>
to the appointment is produced in the audio/video email network scheduling<br>
software at the receiving ends and the sending ends. If the receiver agrees to<br>
the appointment and needs to change to another appointment time (S164). then<br>
an appointment change procedure will be executed, and the procedure will<br>
return to step (S128) as shown in Fig 2B and will carry out the subsequent<br>
procedures.<br>
If the receiver refuses the appointment (S166), the receiver will send a<br>
standard text for the refusal (S170). Referring to Fig. 1G for the schematic<br>
view of a screen, a message. "Please be advised that your appointment is<br>
refused", will be displayed.<br>
If the receiver refuses the appointment and adds an audio/video description<br>
(S168). then the audio/video description and the appomtment screen will be<br>
sent to the senders. (S172).<br>
With the application of a method of making appointments via audicvideo<br>
email network in accordance with the present invention, the senders or<br>
receivers can schedule appointments via network in any situation (different<br>
times or places), so as to overcome the deficiency of the prior arts and perceive,<br>
in a timely manner, the facial expressions or tones of the senders regarding the<br>
appointment, to help them to successfully make the appointment.<br>
While the invention has been described in terms of what is presently<br>
considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiments, it is to be<br>
understood that the invention needs not be limited to the disclosed<br>
embodiment. On the contrary, it is intended to cover various modifications<br>
and similar arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the appended<br>
claims which are to be accorded with the broadest interpretation so as to<br><br><br>
encompass all such modifications and similar structures.<br><br><br>
