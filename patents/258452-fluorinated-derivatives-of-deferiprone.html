TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
FLUORINATED DERIVATIVES OF DEFERIPRONE<br>
REFERENCE TO PRIOR PROVISIONAL APPLICATION<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/907,290 filed March 28, 2007.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel derivatives of deferiprone.  In particular, the present invention relates to fluorinated derivatives of deferiprone or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, pharmaceutical compositions comprising same, processes for the manufacture thereof and their use in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases caused by the presence of free iron or iron accumulation in neural tissues and in diseases wherein excess iron must be removed or redistributed.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The crucial role of metal ions in neurodegeneration and the use of chelators as a promising therapeutic strategy have been reviewed by Gaeta and Hider (Gaeta, A. and Hider, R.C., British Journal of Pharmacology, 2005, 146, 1041-1059).  In patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD), the selective degeneration of the dopamine-containing region of the brain occurs.  The iron levels in the substantia nigra (SN) are elevated.  Fe(II) can react with hydrogen peroxide to generate hydroxyl radical, which in turn leads to cellular degeneration via the destruction of proteins, nucleic acids and phospholipids.  It is proposed that reducing the free iron level with chelators can inhibit the onset of the disease, i.e., neural degeneration.  The latter results in reducing dopaminergic cell loss.  Examples of small molecule chelators for this utility are deferiprone, clioquinol, and desferrioxamine.  These chelators have been claimed to reduce free iron levels in neural tissues as a means to reduce neural degeneration (US 2004/0101521).  The reduction of iron-induced oxidative stress is protective to the neuron.  Iron chelation appears to be one of the new approaches to combat neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and PD.  An effective chelator can, in principle, prevent generation of hydroxyl radical induced by iron-hydrogen peroxide, and mobilize free chelatable iron from the brain, thus exerting its neuroprotective function.<br>
Current drugs used for PD therapy include L-dopa, dopamine (DA) agonists, catechol O-methyl transferase inhibitors such as talcapone, and monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitors such as rasagiline and selegiline.  However, these drugs cannot mitigate the progression of the disease process.  A research group from Israel reported the use of novel bifunctional iron chelators as potential agents in AD, PD and other neurodegenerative diseases (US 6,855,711).  The rationale is based on the observation that increased level of iron, and MAO-B activity in the brain are the major pathogenic factors in PD and other neurodegenerative diseases.  Since iron chelators and MAO-B inhibitors have been shown to possess neuroprotective activity in animals, it is logical to connect the MAO-B inhibitor onto an iron chelator and apply such agents for the treatment and/or prevention of neurodegenerative diseases.  One of the lead compounds is M30, an 8-hydroxyquinoline derivative (iron chelator) attached to a MAO-B inhibitor (Avramovich-Tirosh, Y., et al., Journal of Neurochemistry, 2007, 100, 490–502).<br>
Amyloids are insoluble fibrous protein aggregations (usually polymeric).  From a chemical perspective, amyloids form insoluble beta-pleated sheet structures and cannot be destroyed by proteases.  Amyloid ß (Aß or Abeta) is a small peptide of 39-43 amino acids that is the main constituent of amyloid plaques in the brains of AD patients.  AD is a dementia that results in the irreversible deterioration of mental function and eventually leads to the death of the patient.  Aß is also found in the brains of patients with Down’s syndrome.  Due to its more hydrophobic nature, the Aß42 fragment is the most amyloidogenic form of the peptide allowing them to build up with other fragments to form AD plaque.<br>
New therapeutic approaches to the treatment or prevention of AD involve slowing, or reversing Aß accumulation.  The mechanism of toxicity and the neurochemical events that cause Aß deposition are still unclear, but transition metals such as copper, zinc (II) and iron (III) are found concentrated in and around amyloid plaques (Lovell, M. A., et al., J. Neurol. Sci. 1998, 158: 47-52).  Aß is known to exhibit a high affinity for transition metal ions.  The binding of metal, in particular Zn++, and to a lesser extent Cu++ and Fe3+, to Aß markedly increases its aggregation and the formation of amyloid deposits (Bush, A. I., et al., Science, 1994, 265: 1464-1467).  Cherny et al. demonstrated that both processes (aggregation and deposition) can be reversed in the presence of metal-chelating agents (Cherny, R. A., et al., J. Biol. Chem. 1999, 274: 23223-23228).  The binding of redox active transition metals (i.e., Cu2+ and Fe3+) to Aß also leads to the generation of reactive oxygen species (Sayre, L. M., et al., J. Neurochem. 2000, 74: 270-279), which are known to have deleterious effects on a wide variety of biomolecules.  Biometal- and amyloid-mediated production of reactive oxygen species are believed to be responsible, at least in part, for the oxidative stress observed in the brains of AD patients (Gabbita, S. P., et al., J. Neurochem. 1998, 71: 2034-2040).<br>
Barnham et al. reported the use of chelators as metal-protein attenuating compounds (MPAC) for the treatment of AD (Barnham, K. J., et al., Drug Design Reviews - Online, 2004, 1, 75-82).  The chelator is proposed to chelate the metal at the accumulation site in the brain and redistribute to other tissues inside the brain.  The chelator clioquinol, 5-chloro-8-hydroxy-7-iodo-quinoline has been used as an oral drug in a phase II clinical trial (Ritchie, C. W., et al., Arch Neurol, 2003, 60, 1685-1691).  Due to manufacturing problems with clioquinol and the presence of the 5,7-diiodo analogue, a replacement analogue to clioquinol is being developed by Prana Biotechnology Ltd. (Melbourne, Australia) for the treatment of AD.<br>
The design and development of deferiprone, a low molecular weight iron chelator has been reviewed (Kontoghiorghes, G. J., et al., Current Medicinal Chemistry, 2004, 11 2161-83).  In addition to its use in the treatment of the above neurogenerative diseases, deferiprone may also be used to redistribute iron in conditions such as Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome and Friedreich’s ataxia.<br>
The bidentate chelator deferiprone, 3-hydroxy-1,2-dimethyl-1H-pyridin-4-one is a drug used in the treatment of iron overload disease.  The same drug can be used in non-iron overloaded conditions and towards the treatment of neurogenerative diseases (US 2004/0101521).  In order to use a chelator to mobilize free chelatable iron from the brain and exert its neuroprotective function, the chelator must penetrate the blood brain barrier (BBB) to reach the neural tissues.  Deferiprone is chosen because of its low molecular weight (139) and its ability to penetrate the BBB.  For example, deferiprone has a distribution coefficient of 0.17 at pH 7.4 and its ability to penetrate the BBB can be estimated by an experimentally determined physico-chemical parameter kBMC wherein BMC is known as biopartitioning micellar chromatography.  Escuder-Gilabert et al. reported the potential of BMC as an in vitro technique for predicting drug penetration across the BBB (Escuder-Gilabert, L., et al., Journal of Chromatrography B, 2004, 807, 193-201) and demonstrated the usefulness of BMC for correlating experimentally determined BBB penetration of drugs and determined the kBMC of more than 30 known central nervous system (CNS) drug substances.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide fluorinated analogues of deferiprone and the composition of such compounds, which analogues are active as iron chelators and hence useful in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases caused by the presence of free iron or accumulation of iron in neural tissues.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide fluorinated analogues of deferiprone and the composition of such compounds, which analogues are useful as chelators in the removal of iron in diseases wherein excess iron must be removed or redistributed.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide processes for the synthesis of fluorinated analogues of deferiprone compounds.<br>
If one increases the lipophilicity of the 3-hydroxy-1,2-dimethyl-1H-pyridin-4-one chelator pharmacophore by attaching properly designed substituents, one would expect to significantly improve the kBMC value of the new analogues.  This approach predicts that new compounds will penetrate the BBB and a reasonable amount of drug substance will be available in the brain to exert its pharmacological action.  We attached fluoroalkyl substituents at the 2 or 6 position of the 3-hydroxy-4-pyridinone skeleton, and evaluated the kBMC values of fluoro derivatives of deferiprone using the above methods.  The chemical stability of these novel fluoro analogues of deferiprone was also evaluated.  Employing BMC as an in vitro technique for predicting drug penetration across the BBB, we invented a series of stable fluorinated deferiprone analogues with improved kBMC values over deferiprone.  These compounds have advantages over deferiprone in the penetration of the BBB.  Availability of the drug in the brain ensures that the compound can chelate free iron in neural tissues, thus enabling the removal or redistribution of free iron ion.  Since the chelator may be used to redistribute iron, chelators with the 3-hydroxy-4-pyranone skeleton may also be used if the fluoroalkyl substituent attachment to the pyranone ring improves its BBB penetration properties.<br>
There is very limited information on the synthesis of fluorinated derivatives of 3-hydroxy-pyridin-4-one and their use in medicinal chemistry.  EP 0 336 369 A1 reported compound (A) as a crude material and the conversion of the CHF2 functionality to CHO with trifluoroacetic acid<br>
      (A).<br>
EP 0 120 670 B1 generally discloses an iron complex of a 3-hydroxypyridone of the chemical structure (B)<br>
      (B)<br>
in which each R’ separately is a C1-6 aliphatic hydrocarbon group or a C1-3 alkyl group substituted by a C1-4 alkoxy, halogen or hydroxy group, R” is a C1-6 aliphatic hydrocarbon group, a formyl or (C1-4 alkyl)-carbonyl group, or a C1-8 aliphatic hydrocarbon group substituted by one or more substituents selected from formyl, (C1-4 alkyl)-carbonyl, C1-4 alkoxy, carbamoyl, sulphamoyl, mono- and di- C1-6 aliphatic hydrocarbyl N-substituted carbamoyl and N-substituted sulphamoyl, formylamino, ((C1-6 aliphatic hydrocarbyl) – carbonylamino, (C1-6 aliphatic hydrocarbyl) – sulphonylamino, mono-C1-6 aliphatic hydrocarbyl N-substituted formylamino, N-substituted (C1-6 aliphatic hydrocarbyl) – carbonylamino and N-substituted (C1-6 aliphatic hydrocarbyl) – sulphonylamino, formyloxy, (C1-6 aliphatic hydrocarbyl) – carbonyloxy, (C1-6 aliphatic hydrocarbyl) – oxycarbonyl, (C1-6 aliphatic hydrocarbyl) – sulphonyloxy, (C1-6 aliphatic hydrocarbyl) – oxysulphonyl, halogen and hydroxy groups, and n is 0, 1, 2 or 3.  However, EP 0 120 670 B1 does not specifically disclose mono halo compounds of formula (B) wherein R’ is a C1-3 aliphatic hydrocarbon group substituted by a halogen and R” is a C1-6 aliphatic hydrocarbon group, their characterization or methods for their synthesis.<br>
In our search for a new analogue of deferiprone with better partition coefficient and BBB penetration properties, we first investigated the synthesis of a compound with the chemical structure (C)<br>
      (C).<br>
We have determined that compound (C) is an unstable compound in aqueous solution.  We then investigated the synthesis of a compound with the chemical structure (D)<br>
      (D).<br>
We determined that this compound can be prepared, but it is also unstable in aqueous solution.  These results led to further structural refinement and design of 3-hydroxy-4-pyridinones that are more lipophilic than deferiprone, and with better BBB penetration properties than deferiprone in a biopartitioning micellar high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) system.  The novel F-analogues of deferiprone of the present invention can be used to replace deferiprone and other less effective chelators in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.<br>
The present invention is based upon the preparation of a class of 3-hydroxy-4-pyridinone derivatives and selected 3-hydroxy-4-pyranone derivatives that are chemically stable with higher BBB permeability than deferiprone.  The ability of a chelator to remove iron in a biological system is governed by the pFe(III).  pFe(III) is a chemical parameter and is defined as –log [Fe(III)], the free unbound iron concentration in a system with 1 x 10-5 M chelator and 1 x 10-6 M Fe(III).  Compounds of the present invention have pFe(III) values above 19 and are extremely useful in extracting excess iron from the body.  Examples of compounds in the prior art that have pFe(III) values above 19 and that are useful in extracting excess iron from the body include deferiprone (L1), deferasirox (ICL670), desferral (desferrioxamine, DFO).<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
As used herein:<br>
The term “alkyl” refers to an aliphatic hydrocarbon chain with the formula CnH2n+1.  C1 C6 alkyl refers to the alkyl group with 1 to 6 carbon atoms, i.e., n=1 to 6.  C1 C4 alkyl refers to the alkyl group with 1 to 4 carbon atoms, i.e., n=1 to 4.  C1 C3 alkyl refers to the alkyl group with 1 to 3 carbon atoms, i.e., n=1 to 3.  The aliphatic carbon chain can be linear or branched.  Examples of an alkyl group include, but are not limited to, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, 2-butyl, isobutyl and tert-butyl.<br>
The distribution coefficient of a solute between two phases is calculated as the ratio of the concentration of the solute in one phase to the concentration of the solute in the other phase under equilibrium conditions.  The solute is the compound of interest.  One phase is octanol, while the other phase is normally phosphate buffer at a pH of 7.4.  The term “D7.4” refers to the distribution coefficient at pH 7.4.  D7.4 reflects the true behavior of an ionizable compound in a solution at pH 7.4.  This property is exceptionally useful in evaluating pH-dependent pharmacokinetic properties, drug absorption, bioavailability, metabolism and toxicity.<br>
The term “log BB” refers to the logarithm value of brain to plasma concentration ratio of the solute wherein the solute is the drug substance under study (Usansky, H. H. and Sinko, P. J., Pharmaceutical Research, 2003, 20, 390-396).<br>
The term “pFe3+” refers to –log [Fe3+]. [Fe3+] is the concentration of free, unchelated Fe3+ in a mixture containing 1 x 10-5 M chelator and 1 x 10-6 M Fe3+.  The pFe3+ is a measure of the effectiveness of a compound in the chelation of Fe3+.  The higher the pFe value, the less available is the presence of unchelated Fe(III).  Free iron ion can result in redox reactions in biological systems.<br>
The term “log kBMC” refers to the logarithm of the chromatographic capacity factor (reference retention time) in BMC, a special type of HPLC (Escuder-Gilabert, L., et al., Journal of Chromatography B, 2004, 807, 193-201).  This analytical technique was used to correlate the log kBMC of 31 reference drug substances with known experimentally determined log BB values.  A linear regression mathematical equation log BB = a(log kBMC) + b was obtained from these reference drug substances wherein a and b are constants.  The log kBMC of the compounds of the present invention was measured by BMC.  The experimental log kBMC of the compounds of the present invention was fit into the log BB = a(log kBMC) + b equation to obtain a calculated log BB value.  The calculated log BB is an indicator of the BBB penetration property of the compounds of the present invention.<br>

The preferred compounds according to the present invention are chemically stable with log kBMC values higher than that of deferiprone, and are stable in pH 7.4 phosphate buffer and 0.01 M sodium hydroxide solution.<br>
Figure 1 provides a table illustrating the physical properties of selected compounds of formula (I) according to the present invention.  D7.4 is the distribution coefficient of the compound in octanol and pH 7.4 phosphate buffer and is a measure of the lipophilicity of the compound in a chemical system.  This parameter can be used to predict the ability of the compounds to penetrate the cell.  The technique of Escuder-Gilabert et al. (Escudar-Gilabert, L., et al., Journal of Chromatography B, 2004, 807, 193-201) is used to predict the drug penetration across the BBB.  Log kBMC is the logarithm of the chromatographic capacity factor (reference retention time) in BMC, a special type of HPLC.  The chromatographic capacity factor kBMC of 31 reference drug substances with known experimentally determined log BB values were recorded (Figures 2 and 3).  BB is known as the blood brain partition coefficient and is defined as the parts of the drug in the brain versus the parts of the drug in the blood.  We found that the log BB values of the 31 reference drug substances are proportional to the log kBMC values and follow the mathematical equation:  log BB = -0.98 + log kBMC with r2 = 0.72.  r2 is the linear coefficient and reflects the quality of the data fit of log BB against log kBMC.  We used the above equation to compute a calculated log BB value of the compounds of the present invention as an estimate of the BBB penetration properties of the compounds.  Deferiprone is known to penetrate the BBB and has a calculated log BB value of  1.05.  All compounds of the present invention with a calculated log BB value &gt;  1.05 will have BBB penetration properties.  Although not bound by theory, a log BB value of  0.5 means that approximately 25% of the drug penetrates the BBB and gets into the brain (log BB =  0.5 implies a BB = 0.32 [inverse log BB] and thus 1 part of the drug in the brain versus 3 parts of the drug in the blood).<br>
Figure 4 provides a table illustrating the chemical properties of a series of compounds of formula (I) according to the present invention.  The definition of pKa1 and pKa2 is shown below:<br><br>
We have determined the pKa values of the compounds of formula (I) according to the present invention and have further determined the ferric complexation constant of the compounds.  The metal complexation constant is defined below:<br>
K1, K2, K3, and log ß3 = log K1 + log K2 + log K3<br><br>
Compounds of the present invention are bidentate ligands and chelate Fe(III) in the ratio of 3:1.  Therefore there are three complexation constants K1, K2 and K3. ß3 is the overall complexation constant with Fe(III).  With these parameters, one can compute the pFe3+ of each chelator.  pFe3+ is –log [Fe3+] (free unchelated ferric ion concentration) in a mixture of 1 x 10-6 Fe3+ and 1 x 10-5 M chelator.  For example, the drug deferiprone has a pFe3+ of 20.2, and the published compound CP502 has a pFe3+ of 21.  Both chemicals are known to be extremely efficient in the removal of Fe3+ from the body.  Although not bound by theory, a compound with a pFe3+ of about 19 and above is efficient in the removal of iron by the formation of FeL3 wherein L is chelator.  Computation shows that 100% of the ferric ion is chelated at a pH of about 7 to about 7.4 and there is no free available ferric ion to undergo redox cycle reactions to produce free radicals.  Figure 5 shows the speciation plot of Apo6719, a compound of formula (I) according to the present invention.  A pFe3+ of 19.7 assures that the compound is effective as an iron chelator in the removal of iron.  The x axis is the pH.  The y axis shows the molar fraction of the different components of the bidentate chelator.  FeL3 refers to one Fe3+ is bound by three molecules of the ligand L, which is Apo6719 in this figure.  As shown in Figure 5, at a pH of about 7 to about 9, all of the free iron is bound by the chelator as FeL3.<br>
The chemical stability of fluorinated derivatives of deferiprone was evaluated.  For example, the mono fluoro derivative of the formula (V) is unstable in pH 7.4 phosphate buffer and 0.01M sodium hydroxide.  The products of decomposition are compounds (VA) and (VB).<br><br>
We deteremined that the difluoro derivative Apo6719 is stable under similar conditions.<br>
The C2-difluoro derivatives of the formulas (VI) and (VII) according to the present invention are also unstable in pH 7.4 phosphate buffer and in 0.01 M sodium hydroxide.  Compound (VI) decomposes to give compound (VIA), which is a stable chemical compound that exists as the hydrated aldehyde.  Therefore, the compounds (VI) and (VII) are prodrugs to the hydrated aldehyde (VIA) and (VIIA) respectively.  Their usefulness is in the role as a prodrug and not as an intact fluorinated 3-hydroxy-4-pyridinone derivative.<br><br>
Hydrolysis of the difluoro group of a 2-difluoromethyl-3-hydroxy-4-pyridinone derivative, wherein hydrogen is attached to the ring nitrogen, to an aldehyde with trifluoroacetic acid can be found in Example 75 of EP 0 336 369 A1.<br>
We have also prepared the compound of formula (VIII) wherein R4 is methyl.  The compound (VIIIA) could be prepared, but catalytic hydrogenation resulted in the loss of the fluoride group at the C2 substituent of the 3-hydroxy-4-pyridinone to give compound (VIIIB).  Reaction of compound (VIIIA) with 4M hydrochloric acid gives compound (VIIIC).<br><br>
Thus it is not obvious to a person skilled in the art to design fluorinated analogues of deferiprone with the required parameters such as chemical stability, an acceptable pFe3+, and better BBB penetration properties than deferiprone.<br>
We determined that compounds of formula (I) according to the present invention wherein R4 is CHF2 are stable in pH 7.4 buffer, sodium hydroxide, deionized water and methanol.  Other compounds of formula (I) according to the present invention wherein R2 is selected from the group consisting of CF3CHOH and CH2CH3 are stable under similar conditions.  With the exception of compounds (VI) and (VII) that are prodrugs, the compounds of formula (I) according to the present invention are stable fluorinated derivatives in a chemical system with high pFe3+ values above about 19 and high predicted log BB values.  The latter assures that the compounds of formula (I) according to the present invention will penetrate the BBB upon dosing to mammals.<br>
Preferred compounds of formula (II) according to the present invention are those in which R1 is selected from the group consisting of methyl, ethyl, allyl, cyclopropyl and cyclopropylmethyl; R2 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, methyl, ethyl,  CH2OH and CH3CH(OH) ; and R3 is hydrogen.  Particularly preferred compounds of formula (II) according to the present invention are those in which R1 is selected from the group consisting of methyl and cyclopropyl; R2 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, methyl and ethyl; and R3 is hydrogen.<br>
Preferred compounds of formula (III) according to the present invention are those in which R3 is hydrogen, R4 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and methyl, R1 is as defined above, and R2 is selected from the group consisting of CF3CH2 and CF3CH(OH) .<br>
Particularly preferred compounds of formula (III) according to the present invention are those in which R2 is selected from the group consisting of CF3CH2 and CF3CH(OH) , R3 is hydrogen, R4 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and methyl, and R1 is methyl.<br>
Preferred compounds of formula (IV) according to the present invention are those in which R2 is CF3CH(OH)  and R3 and R4 are each hydrogen.<br>

Salts of two types may be formed from the compounds of the present invention:  (1) salts of inorganic and organic bases from compounds of formulas (I), (II), (III), (IIIC) and (IV) which have a 3-hydroxy functional group in the 3-hydroxy-4-pyridinone skeleton; and (2) acid addition salts may be formed at the N1-amine functional group of compounds of formulas (II), (III) and (IIIC) of the present invention.<br>

wherein the method comprises the following processes:<br>

(c)	reacting compound (3) with an amine of the formula R1NH2 wherein R1 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, C1 C6 alkyl (preferably C1 C4 alkyl), allyl, cyclopropyl and cyclopropylmethyl to give compound (4) wherein R1 is defined as in R1NH2; and<br>
(d)	hydrogenation of compound (4) with palladium on charcoal to give a compound of formula (IIA) (a compound of formula (II) when R2 and R3 are each hydrogen), with the proviso that when R1 in compound (4) is allyl, boron tribromide is used instead of catalytic hydrogenation;<br>
or<br>

(g)	reacting compound (6) with benzyl bromide and sodium hydroxide to give compound (7) wherein R5 is as defined above;<br>
(h)	reacting compound (7) with an amine of the formula R1NH2, wherein R1 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, C1 C6 alkyl (preferably C1 C4 alkyl), allyl, cyclopropyl and cyclopropylmethyl, to give compound (8) wherein R1 is as defined in R1NH2; and<br>
(i)	hydrogenation of compound (8) with palladium on charcoal to give a compound of formula (IIB) (a compound of formula (II) when R2 is R5CHOH), with the proviso that R1 is not allyl;<br>
or<br>
Process (C) which comprises the following steps:<br><br>
(j)	reacting compound (7) from Process (B), step (g), with thionyl chloride to give the chloride (9) wherein R5 is defined as above;<br>
(k)	reduction of compound (9), prepared from step (j) in situ, without isolation, with zinc in hydrochloric acid to give compound (10);<br>
(l)	reacting compound (10) from step (k) with an amine of the formula R1NH2 wherein R1 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, C1 C6 alkyl (preferably C1 C4 alkyl), allyl, cyclopropyl and cyclopropylmethyl to give compound (11) wherein R1 is as defined in R1NH2; and<br>
(m)	hydrogenation of compound (11) from step (l) with palladium on charcoal to give a compound of formula (IIC) (a compound of formula (II) when R2 is CH2R5), with the proviso that R1 is not allyl;<br>
or<br>
Process (D) which comprises the following steps:<br><br>
(n)	reacting compound (8) from Process (B), step (h), wherein R5 is hydrogen with triethylamine and methanesulfonyl chloride to give compound (8A); and<br>
(o)	hydrogenation of compound (8A) with palladium on charcoal to give a compound of formula (IIC) (a compound of formula (II) when R2 is CH2R5), wherein R5 is hydrogen and with the proviso that R1 is not allyl;<br>
or<br>
Process (E) which comprises the following steps:<br><br>
reacting a compound of formula (IIA) with CF3CH(O-C1-C4 linear alkyl)OH, preferably CF3CH(OCH3)OH or CF3CH(OCH2CH3)OH, and most preferably CF3CH(OCH3)OH, in the presence of potassium carbonate at a temperature of about 100°C to about 130°C to give a compound of formula (IIB) wherein R3 is hydrogen, and R2 is R5CHOH wherein R5 is trifluoromethyl.<br>
In Process (A), step (a), compound (1) is oxidized with TEMPO and sodium hypochlorite to give the aldehyde (2).  Although other oxidizing agents such as the Swern oxidation can be used, the preferred method of oxidation is the TEMPO oxidation because there are no sulphur by-products and sodium hypochlorite is easily available.  Reaction of (2) with DAST (Et2NSF3) converts the aldehyde (2) to the C2-difluoromethyl derivative (3), which then undergoes amine insertion of R1NH2 to give the protected 3-hydroxy-4-pyridinone (4) in an inert solvent such as dimethylformamide or ethanol.  Compound (4) is hydrogenated in ethanol or methanol with palladium on charcoal to give the compound of formula (IIA).  When R1 = allyl in compound (4), the O- benzyl group is removed by treatment with boron tribromide instead of catalytic hydrogenation to avoid the reduction of the double bond at the allyl group.<br>
In Process (B), compound (3) is used as the starting material. Catalytic hydrogenation affords the 3-hydroxy derivative (5) which reacts with an aliphatic aldehyde R5CHO to give compound (6).  The direct conversion of compound (6) to a compound of formula (IIB) is not possible via amine insertion of R1NH2.  Rather, compound (6) is again protected in step (g) with sodium hydroxide and benzyl bromide to give compound (7). Compound (7) undergoes amine insertion to give compound (8), which can be converted to a compound of formula (IIB) by catalytic hydrogenation with palladium on charcoal.<br>
In Process (C), compound (7) is treated with thionyl chloride to give compound (9) in situ.  Without isolation, zinc metal reduction with hydrochloric acid produces compound (10).  Amine insertion with R1NH2 gives compound (11), and catalytic hydrogenation produces a compound of formula (IIC).<br>
In Process (D), compound (8) is reacted with triethylamine and methanesulfonyl chloride to give compound (8A).  Without isolation, compound (8A) is hydrogenated over palladium on charcoal in the presence of acetic acid to give a compound of formula (IIC).<br>
In Process (E), a compound of formula (IIA) is reacted with CF3CH(O-C1-C4 linear alkyl)OH, preferably CF3CH(OCH3)OH or CF3CH(OCH2CH3)OH, and most preferably CF3CH(OCH3)OH, in the presence of potassium carbonate at a temperature of about 100°C to about 130°C in a sealed tube to give a compound of formula (IIB) wherein R3 is hydrogen and R2 is R5CHOH wherein R5 is trifluoromethyl.<br>
In Process (B), step (i) hydrogenation will convert a compound (8) wherein R1 is allyl to a compound of formula (IIB) wherein R1 is propyl.  In Process (C), step (m) hydrogenation will convert a compound (11) wherein R1 is allyl to a compound of formula (IIC) wherein R1 is propyl.  In Process (D), step (o) hydrogenation will convert a compound (8A) wherein R1 is allyl to a compound of formula (IIC) wherein R1 is propyl.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for the preparation of a compound of formula (III)<br>
      (III)<br>
wherein:<br>
R1 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, C1-C4 alkyl, allyl, cyclopropyl and cyclopropylmethyl;<br>
R4 is selected from the group consisting of methyl and hydrogen;<br>
R3 is selected from the group consisting of methyl and hydrogen;<br>
R2 is selected from the group consisting of CF2, CF3CHOH and CF3CH2; and<br>
wherein the method comprises the following steps:<br><br>
(a)	reaction of compound (12) with CF3CH(O-C1-C4 linear alkyl)OH, preferably CF3CH(OCH3)OH or CF3CH(OCH2CH3)OH, and most preferably CF3CH(OCH3)OH, to give a compound of formula (IIIA) (a compound of formula (III) wherein R2 is CF3CH(OH));<br>
(b)	reacting the product of formula (IIIA) from step (a) with benzyl bromide and sodium hydroxide to give compound (13) wherein R3, R4 and R1 are defined as above;<br>
(c)	converting compound (13) into the methanesulfonate (14) with methanesulfonyl chloride and triethylamine, wherein R1, R3 and R4 are as defined as above; and<br>
(d)	hydogenation of compound (14) in the presence of palladium on charcoal to give a compound of formula (IIIB) (a compound of formula (III) wherein R1 is selected from the group consisting of C1-C4 alkyl, cyclopropyl and cyclopropylmethyl; R4 is selected from the group consisting of methyl and hydrogen; R3 is hydrogen; and R2 is CF3CH2), with the proviso that R1 is not allyl.<br>
The 3-hydroxy-4-pyridinone (12) reacts with CF3CH(O-C1-C4 linear alkyl)OH, preferably CF3CH(OCH3)OH or CF3CH(OCH2CH3)OH, and most preferably CF3CH(OCH3)OH, and potassium carbonate to give a compound of formula (IIIA).  It should be noted that the reaction of compound (12) with an aliphatic aldehyde to give a compound of formula (IIIA) directly is unknown in the literature. In the traditional approach, the aldehyde reaction is carried out with the 3-hydroxy-4-pyranone (15) to give compound (16), followed by O-benyzlation of compound (16) to give compound (17).  The amine insertion of compound (17) with R1NH2 normally gives the protected derivative (13), which is then hydrogenated to give the compound of formula (IIIA).  We have determined that compound (17) does not readily undergo amine insertion to give compound (13) in good yield.  Therefore, the present invention provides a novel and direct synthesis of compound (IIIA) using a one step reaction from compound (12).  Compound IIIA is protected in step (b) with benzyl bromide and sodium hydroxide to give compound (14).  Compound (14) is converted into the methanesulfonate (15) with methanesulfonyl chloride and triethylamine.  Catalytic hydrogenation with palladium on charcoal produces the compound of formula (IIIB).  In step (b) above, hydrogenation will convert compound (14) wherein R1 is allyl to a compound of formula (IIIB) wherein R1 is propyl.<br><br>

Catalytic hydrogenation with palladium on charcoal produces the compound of formula (IIIC).<br>
The synthesis of a compound of formula (IIIC) wherein R2 is methyl and R4 is hydrogen is illustrated in Example 19 below.<br>
Certain compounds of the present invention may be converted to their corresponding pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts by virtue of the presence of a basic amine nitrogen.  These compounds may be converted from the free base form to various acid addition salts by treating with a stoichiometric excess of the appropriate organic or inorganic acid, such as, for example, phosphoric, pyruvic, hydrochloric or sulfuric acid and the like.  Typically, the free base is dissolved in a polar organic solvent such as p-dioxane or dimethoxyethane, and the acid added thereto.  The temperature is maintained from about 0ºC to about 50ºC.  The resulting acid addition salt precipitates spontaneously or may be precipitated out of solution with a less polar solvent.  These acid addition salts may be decomposed to the corresponding free base by treating with a stoichiometric amount of a suitable base, such as potassium carbonate or sodium hydroxide, typically in the presence of aqueous solvent, and at a temperature of from about 0ºC to about 50ºC.  The free base form is isolated by conventional means, such as extraction with an organic solvent. Acid addition salts of the compounds of the present invention may be interchanged by taking advantage of differential solubilities of the salts, volatilities or acidities of the acids, or by treating with an appropriately loaded ion exchange resin.  For example, the interchange is effected by the reaction of a salt of the compounds of formula (I) with a slight stoichiometric excess of an acid of a lower pKa than the acid component of the starting salt.  This is carried out at a temperature of from about 0ºC to about the boiling point of the solvent being used.<br>

Example 1<br>
Preparation of 5-benzyloxy-2-hydroxymethyl-pyran-4-one<br>
A 10M NaOH solution (110 mL, 1.10 mol) was added to a suspension of kojic acid (142.1 g, 1.00 mol) in methanol (1 L) with mechanical stirring at room temperature. Benzyl bromide (137.0 mL, 1.15 mol) was added, and the resulting clear yellow solution was refluxed using a heating mantle for 3 h.  The progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC using a mixture of CH2Cl2 and MeOH (9/1, v/v) as eluant, and by HPLC (method 1).  Most of the MeOH was removed under vacuum using a rotary evaporator, and a dense solid separated.  The solid was collected by suction filtration, and the filtrate was set aside for further extraction.<br>
The solid was slurried in a mixture of water (2L) and acetone (200 mL), then collected by suction filtration and dried to constant weight under vacuum in an oven at 40oC for overnight.  The weight of this first crop of white solid product was 150.0 g.<br>
The filtrate set aside above was diluted with water (300 mL).  It was extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 x 500 mL).  The combined organic fractions were dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated in vacuo to give a solid.  The solid was slurried in water (200 mL) and acetone (20 mL), then collected and dried as described above for the first crop.  The weight of this second crop of white solid product was 22.0 g.  The two crops were combined to give a total yield of 74%.  The purity (peak area percent: &gt;95%) of this material was analysed by HPLC Method 1:  Column: XTerra MS C18; 5 µm, 4.6×250mm; Mobile phase: A = the aqueous phase: 8 mM Tris, 4 mM EDTA, pH 7.4; B = the organic phase: CH3CN; gradient: %B: 0 min – 5%, 15 min - 55%, 15 to 25 min – 55%, 25 to 30 min - 5%; Flow rate:  1 mL/min; ?: 254, 280, 320, 450 nm; RT = retention time, given in the experimental wherever appropriate.  1H NMR (400MHz, DMSO-D6) ? (ppm): 8.18 (s, 1H), 7.35-7.43 (m, 5H), 6.33 (s, 1H), 5.70 (t, J = 6.0 Hz, 1H, OH), 4.95 (s, 2H, CH2Ph), 4.30 (d, J = 5.6 Hz, 2H, CH2OH).<br>
Example 2<br>
Preparation of 5-benzyloxy-4-oxo-4H-pyran-2-carbaldehyde<br>
Method 1 – TEMPO oxidation:  Solid NaHCO3 (96.0 g, 1.21 mol) and deionized water (125 mL) were added to a mixture of 5-benzyloxy-2-hydroxymethyl-pyran-4-one (40.0 g, 0.17 mol) in CH2Cl2 (550 mL) and deionized water (200 mL).  The mixture was cooled in an ice-salt bath to about 0oC.  Then, KBrO3 (4.00 g, 24.1 mmol), n-Bu4N+Br- (2.20 g, 6.90 mmol) and TEMPO (0.54 g, 3.44 mmol) were successively added.  To the resulting heterogeneous mixture at 0oC was added a solution of 1.59 M NaOCl (140 mL, 1.3 equiv) within 5-7 min.  The reaction mixture turned to orange then to bright yellow during the NaOCl addition.  The mixture was stirred for an additional 1-2 min, and then the solid was filtered off by suction filtration.  The filtrate was placed in a separatory funnel, and the organic fraction was collected and dried over sodium sulfate.  Analysis of the crude mixture by HPLC Method 1 (? = 280 nm), as described above, indicated the presence of the over-oxidized product (5-benzyloxy-4-oxo-4H-pyran-2-carboxylic acid, peak percent area: 6%, RT = 9.42 min), the desired product (5-benzyloxy-4-oxo-4H-pyran-2-carbaldehyde, peak percent area is 85%, and its RT is 11.34 min) and the starting material (5-benzyloxy-2-hydroxymethyl-pyran-4-one, peak percent area is 8%, and its RT is 12.18 min).<br>
The organic fraction was filtered and the volume was reduced to about 60 mL using the rotary evaporator.  The mixture was placed on top of a wet-packed silica gel column, and eluted with ethyl acetate.  The fractions containing the product were combined.  Upon concentration on the rotary evaporator (volume reduction), the product separated out as a solid.  The solid was collected by suction filtration to provide a first crop (10 g after drying under vacuum).  The filtrate was collected and the volume of solvent reduced under vacuum. The precipitated solid was collected by filtration to give a second crop (5 g after drying under vacuum).  The crops were combined to provide a 38% yield of the titled compound.  The purity (peak area percent is 97.4%) of this material was analysed by HPLC Method 1 as described above.  1H NMR (400MHz, DMSO-D6) ? (ppm): 9.64 (s, 1H), 8.41 (s, 1H), 7.32-7.43 (m, 5H), 7.13 (s, 1H), 5.01 (s, 2H, CH2Ph).<br>
Method 2: sulfur trioxide pyridine complex oxidation:  A suspension of 5-benzyloxy-2-hydroxymethyl-pyran-4-one (30.0 g, 0.129 mol) in CHCl3 (500 mL) and CH2Cl2 (100 mL) was cooled in an ice-salt bath to about 0oC. DMSO (150 mL) and Et3N (105 mL, 0.752 mol) were added, and a clear yellow solution was obtained.  The mixture was stirred for about 30 min as the temperature reached to below 0oC.  Then, sulfur trioxide pyridine crushed powder (105 g, 0.660 mol) was added portionwise over 30 min.  No significant exotherm was observed as the reaction temperature read below 0oC.  The progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC using a mixture of hexanes and ethyl acetate (1/1, v/v) as eluant.  After 1 h, the cooling bath was removed, and the reaction mixture was allowed to stir at room temperature for overnight.  The reaction mixture was diluted with CH2Cl2 (200 mL), then quenched with a 5% citric acid solution (150 mL).  The organic fraction was washed again with 100 mL of the citric acid solution.  Each of the aqueous acidic fractions were back-extracted with CH2Cl2 (2 x 100 mL), and all of the organic fractions were combined, dried over sodium sulfate, and purified as described in method 1 above.  Thus, 13.4 g (45%) of the desired compound was obtained, and its 1H NMR was similar to the one described in method 1 above.<br>
Example 3<br>
Preparation of 5-benzyloxy-2-difluoromethyl-pyran-4-one<br>
To a clear solution of 5-benzyloxy-4-oxo-4H-pyran-2-carbaldehyde (10.0 g, 43.4 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (125 mL) was added DAST (8.40 g, 52.1 mmol) dropwise at room temperature.  Soon after addition, TLC analysis of the reaction mixture using a mixture of hexanes and ethyl acetate (4/1, v/v) as eluant indicated consumption of the starting material.  The reaction mixture was diluted with CH2Cl2 (80 mL), and quenched by the slow addition of a 10% NaHCO3 solution (80 mL).  Another portion of CH2Cl2 (125 mL) was added, and the mixture was left stirring for about 20 min.  The organic fraction was collected, and the aqueous layer was extracted with CH2Cl2 (80 mL).  The combined organic fractions were dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and the volume was reduced using the rotary evaporator to about 30 mL.  Purification of the residue by column chromatography on silica gel using a mixture of hexanes and ethyl acetate (4/1, v/v) as eluant afforded the title compound (5.02 g, 46% yield).  1H NMR (400MHz, DMSO-D6) ?

After 10 min, TLC analysis of the reaction mixture using a mixture of CH2Cl2 and MeOH (20/1, v/v) as eluant indicated consumption of the starting material.  The reaction mixture was quenched with MeOH (5 mL), and evaporated to dryness.  The residual oil was taken up in ethyl acetate (30 mL), and the organic layer was washed with brine (2 x 10 mL), dried over sodium sulfate.  The mixture was filtered, and the filtrate was concentrated in vacuo to give a solid.  The solid was triturated with ether, and was then collected by suction filtration.  The title compound was obtained as an off-white solid (80 mg, 50% yield).  The purity (peak area percent is 97.3%) of this material was analysed by HPLC Method 1 as described above. 1H NMR (400MHz, DMSO-D6) ? (ppm): 9.59 (s, 1H), 8.22 (s, 1H), 6.93 (t, J = 52.8 Hz, 1H, CF2H), 6.76 (s, 1H).<br>

The reaction mixture slowly turned into a clear yellow solution.  The progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC using a mixture of methanol and dichloromethane (1/20, v/v) as eluant, and HPLC method 1 as described above.  After 70 minutes, the reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo to obtain an oil.  The oil was diluted with ether and allowed to stir overnight at room temperature.  A precipitate had formed and it was collected by filtration.  The solid was washed with ether, and the title compound was obtained as an off white solid (2.50 g, 75% yield).  The purity of this material was analysed by HPLC Method 1 (peak area percent is 98.8% at l = 288 nm) as described above.  1H NMR (400MHz, DMSO-D6) ?

Step 2:  To an ice-cooled suspension of the benzylated derivative, (1.51 g, 5.10 mmol) obtained in step 1 above, in CH2Cl2 (50 mL) was added a solution of Et3N (1.20 mL, 8.63 mmol) in 2 mL CH2Cl2, followed by methanesulfonyl chloride (0.65 mL, 8.40 mmol).  After 5 min, TLC analysis indicated consumption of starting material. The reaction mixture was diluted with CH2Cl2 (50 mL).

Step 1:  To an ice bath cooled suspension of 2-difluoromethyl-5-hydroxy-pyran-4-one (1.00 g, 6.17 mmol), obtained as described in Example 4, in deionized water was added a 6.0M NaOH solution (1.23 mL, 7.40 mmol).  A clear dark brown red solution was obtained, and CH3CHO (6.0 mL, 107 mmol) was added dropwise.  After 2 hrs, the reaction mixture was cooled in ice and another 3 mL of CH3CHO (54 mmol) was added.  The cooling bath was removed and the reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature overnight.  The progress of the reaction was monitored by HPLC Method 1 as described above.  Thus, after 24 hrs, the composition (% as peak percent area) of the reaction mixture was as follows: desired product (72%), starting material (7%), side products (15%, 2 major less polar components).  The reaction mixture was cooled in ice and the pH was adjusted to 6 with the addition of a 6.0M HCl solution (1 mL).  The mixture was concentrated in vacuo, and the residue was taken up in EtOAc.  The organic layer was washed with brine (2 x 15 mL).  The combined brine layers were back-extracted with EtOAc (2 x).  The organic fractions were combined, dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and evaporated to dryness.  The residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel using a mixture of CH2Cl2 and MeOH (25/1, v/v) as eluant.  Fractions rich in product were combined together, and concentrated to give 6-difluoromethyl-3-hydroxy-2-(1-hydroxy-ethyl)-pyran-4-one as an oil.

A 6.0 M NaOH solution (4 mL, 24 mmol) and BnBr (2.85 mL, 24 mL) were successively added at room temperature.  The progress of the reaction was monitored by HPLC Method 1 as described above.  After 1.5 hrs, HPLC analysis of the reaction mixture indicated presence of about 15% of unreacted starting material.  Thus, another 1 mL of a 6.0 M NaOH solution and 1 mL of BnBr were added, and the mixture was refluxed for 1 hr.  The mixture was cooled to room temperature, and evaporated to dryness.  The residue was taken up in CH2Cl2, and the organic layer was washed with brine (40 mL).  The aqueous brine layer was back washed with CH2Cl2 (40 mL).  The organic fractions were combined, dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and evaporated to dryness.  The residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel using a mixture of CH2Cl2 and MeOH (100/3, v/v) as eluant.  Fractions rich in product were combined together, and concentrated to give 3-benzyloxy-6-difluoromethyl-2-(1-hydroxy-ethyl)-pyran-4-one (4.00 g) as a bright yellow oil.

The mixture was evaporated in vacuo to dryness, and the dark red oily residue was dissolved in CH2Cl2 (30 mL).  The mixture was purified by column chromatography on silica gel using a mixture of CH2Cl2 and MeOH (25/1, v/v) as eluant.  Fractions rich in product were pooled together, and concentrated to give 3-benzyloxy-6-difluoromethyl-2-(1-hydroxy-ethyl)-1-methyl-1H-pyridin-4-one as an oil (0.75 g).  HPLC purity (peak area percent) of this material is 96.5% at ? = 280 nm using HPLC Method 1 as described above.<br>
Step 4:  A mixture of the benzylated pyridin-4-one derivative (0.75 g) obtained as described in step 3 above and 97 mg of a wet 10% Pd-C in methanol (25 mL) was hydrogenated under a 15 psi hydrogen pressure in a Parr apparatus for 25 min.  The mixture was diluted with MeOH (40 mL), sonicated, and filtered over a bed of acid pre-treated CELITE™.  The volume of the filtrate was reduced by rotary evaporation under reduced pressure, as a solid precipitated out.  The solid was collected by suction filtration, dried overnight in a vacuum oven.  Thus, this first crop provided 260 mg of the compound as a white solid.<br>
The filtrate was collected and the volume of solution was reduced.  The flask was then cooled in ice.  The precipitated solid was collected and vacuum-dried.  This second crop afforded another 100 mg of the product.<br>
