Surprisingly, a new bacterial poultry disease has been observed by the present inventors, which occurs primarily in layers and less frequent in broilers. The disease was seen in chicken that had been vaccinated against the bacterium Haemophilus paragallinarum (causative agent of avian Coryza), and Pasteurella multocida (causative agent of fowl cholera). The symptoms of this new disease differ from the specific symptoms of Coryza. Given the fact that the newly discovered disease clearly shows the clinical signs of a upper respiratory tract infection as described below, H. paragallinarum could be ruled out as the causative agent.<br>

No isolations of virus or any other bacteria were made.<br>
Biotyping:<br>
Bacterial isolates were purified and biotyped according to the method described by Jaworski et al.(1). Three different biotypes (4, 2,1) were identified. Briefly, from the purified isolates, a single colony was inoculated into tubes containing 3 ml of Tryptose Broth and incubated at 37°C for 8 hours. A loop of inoculum (20 jal) from the tube was then transferred into another tube containing 3 ml of 1% sugar to be tested and incubated for 7 days at 37°C before results were recorded<br>
Challenge Model:<br>
Following purification of the bacteria, isolates were grown in tryptose media to obtain large quantities of pure pathogens. In order to validate Koch postulates, 3 different groups (20 birds per group) of specific pathogen free (SPF) chicken 13 weeks of age were infected with each biotype (0.2 ml / bird; 3x1 Ofl CPU / ml) by intravenous route. The birds were observed daily for 3 days for morbidity and mortality. At the end of the<br>
3rd day, all birds were sacrificed, post-mortem lesions recorded and organ samples (liver and gonads) were collected for re-isolation. Post-mortem lesions of birds that died were also recorded.<br>
