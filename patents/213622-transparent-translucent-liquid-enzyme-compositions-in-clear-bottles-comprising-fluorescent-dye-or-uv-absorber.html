The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
TRANSPARENT/TRANSLUCENT LIQUID ENZYME<br>
COMPOSITIONS IN CLEAR BOTTLES COMPRISING<br>
FLUORESCENT DYE OR UV ABSORBER<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to enzyme-containing aqueous, transparent or translucent heavy duty liquid laundry detergents in transparent or translucent bottles comprising fluorescer dyes {f-dyes) and/or UV absorbers. The f-dyes and/or UV absorbers are enzymes present in the HDL composition to protect enzymes from damage by harmful UV radiation thereby preserving the enzyme activity.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Liquid detergents have traditionally been sold in opaque bottles. However, use of clear bottles can be aesthetically appealing to consumers as they can see the consistency of product, and suspended particles if they are present. However, the use of clear bottles can lead to the undesirable loss of enzyme activity (i.e., enzymes present in the liquid compositions) by UV light. By UV light is meant light having wavelength of about 250 to about 460 nanometers (nm). Specifically, UVA generally is in range 320-400 nm, UVB about 290 to 320 nm and UVC below 290 nm, down to about 250 nm.<br>
It has been known in the art that UV absorbers can be added to the bottle material during manufacture of clear bottles to protect them from becoming brittle and to protect the ingredients inside the bottle. For instance, in GB 2228940 the use of a dicarboxylate in polyester bottles to protect contents -mainlyfood- frorn-320-360 nm is described.<br><br><br>
In EL) 0461537A2 the use of film formers for blocking UV radiation from passing-through glass bottles is described. While use of such ingredients can block the transmission of UV light through clear bottles, UV absorbers for inclusion in bottle material are expensive, and must be added when bottle material is hot and molten and there is the risk of burning the operator.<br>
WO 97/26315 (to Colgate) discloses transparent containers with specific chromaticity defined by x and y values. Specific dyes are used in the liquid to maintain the container. The reference neither teaches nor suggests transparent liquids with the specific combination of f-dyes and enzyme.<br>
GB 1,303,810 discloses clear liquid medium and visually distinct components suspended in the medium. Detergent compositions containing f-dyes and enzyme capsule are not disclosed.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 3,812,042 to Verdier discloses clear packages containing liquids with a viscosity and clarity control system comprising urea, lower aliphatic alcohol and optional hydrotrope.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has now surprisingly been found that a relatively small amount of f-dye and/or UV absorber, when added to a liquid containing enzymes, has the ability to dramatically reduce the loss of activity by UV light This is unexpected in that the level of additive is small (0.001 to about 3%) and is dispersed throughout    the liquid matrix. The use of f-dye has the advantage that it is an ingredient already frequently used in HDL"s and thus adds little or no additional cost, and it can be added at lower temperatures for safety than found with molten bottle materials. UV absorber added to the HDL has the advantage that it can be<br><br><br>
added at lower and safer temperatures than adding UV absorber to molten bottle material.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to enzyme containing transparent/translucent liquid duty liquids in clear bottles comprising relatively small amounts of f-dye or UV absorber to protect against loss of enzyme activity (e.g., caused by the light hitting enzyme through the clear bottle).<br>
U/V Absorbers<br>
Preferred families of UV absorbers which may be used are benzophenones, salicyclates, benzotriazoles, hindered amines and alkoxy(e.g., methoxy) cinnamates and mixtures thereof. Recitation of these classes is not meant to be a limitation on other classes of UV absorbers which may be used.<br>
Water soluble UV absorbers particularly useful for this application include, but are not limited to: phenyl benzimidazole sulfonic acid (sold as Neo Heliopan, Type Hydro by Haarmann and Reimer Corp.), 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone-5-sulfonic acid (sold as Syntase 230 by Rhone-Poulenc and Uvinul MS-40 by BASF Corp.), sodium 2,2"-dihydroxy-4,4"-dimethoxy-5-sulfobenzophenone(sold as Uvinul DS-49 by BASF Corp.), and PEG-25 paraaminobenzoic acid (sold as Uvinui P-25 by Basf Corp.).<br>
Other UV absorbers Which may be used are defined in McCutcheon"s Volume 2, Functional Materials, North American Edition, published by the Manufacturing Confectioner Publishing Company (1997).<br><br><br>
UV absorber may be present in the formulation with or without F-dye. UV absorber is used in the formulation from 0.001% to 3%, preferably between 0.001 to 1%, more preferably between 0.05% and 1%.<br>
Fluorescent Dyes<br>
Preferred classes of fluorescent dyes which may be used include stilbenes; coumarin and carbostyril compounds; 1,3-diphenyl-2-pyrazolines; naphthalimides; benzadyl substitution products of ethylene, phenylethylene, stilbene, thiophene; and combined heteroaromatics and mixtures thereof.<br>
Especially preferred fluorescent dyes which may be used are also the sulfonic acid salts of diamino stilbene derivatives such as taught in U.S. Patent No. 2,784,220 to Spiegler or U.S. Patent No. 2612,510 to Wilson et al. Polymeric fluorescent whitening agent as taught in U.S. Patent No. 5,082,578 are also contemplated by this invention.<br>
Finally, other dyes which may be used are defined in McCutcheon"s Volume 2, Functional Materials, North American Edition as noted above in connection with UV absorbers.<br>
Fluorescent dyes particularly useful for this application include, but are not I limited to: the distyrylbiphenyl types such as Tinopal CBS-X from Ciba Geigy Corp. and the cyanuric chloride/diaminostilbene types such as Tinopal AMS, DMS, 5BM, and UNPA from Ciba Geigy Corp. and Blankophor DML from Mobay. Fluorescent dye may be present in the formulation with or without a UV  absorber. F-dye is used in the formulation from 0.001% to 3%, preferably  between 0.001 to 1%, more preferably between 0.05% and 0.5%.<br><br><br>
Detergent Compositions<br>
Detergent Active<br>
The compositions of the invention contains one or more surface active agents (surfactants) selected from the group consisting of anionic, nonionic, cationic, ampholytic and zwftterionic surfactants or mixtures thereof. The preferred surfactant detergents for use in the present invention are mixtures of anionic and nonionic surfactants although it is to be understood that any surfactant may be used alone or in combination with any other surfactant or surfactants. The surfactant should comprise at least 10% by wt of the-composition, e.g., 11% to 75%, preferably 15% to 70% of the total composition, more preferably 16% to 65%; even more preferably 20% to 65%.<br>
Nonionic Surfactant<br>
Nonionic synthetic organic detergents which can be used with the invention,<br>
alone or in combination with other surfactants, are described below.<br>
As is well known, the nonionic detergents are characterized by the presence of an organic hydrophobic group and an organic hydrophilic group and are typically produced by the condensation of an organic aliphatic or alkyl aromatic hydrophobic compound with ethylene oxide (hydrophilic in nature). Typical suitable nonionic surfactants are those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,316,812 and 3,630,929.<br>
Usually, the nonionic detergents are polyalkoxylated lipophiles wherein the desired hydrophile-lipophile balance is obtained from addition of a hydrophilic poly-lower alkoxy group to a lipophilic moiety. A preferred class of nonionic detergent is the alkoxylated alkanols wherein the alkanol is of 9 to 18 carbon atoms and wherein the number of moles of alkylene oxide (of 2 or 3 carbon<br><br><br><br>
atoms) is from 3 to 12. Of such materials it is preferred to employ those wherein the alkanol is a fatty alcohol of 9 to 11 or 12 to 15 carbon atoms and which contain from 5 to 8 or 5 to 9 alkoxy groups per mole.<br>
5 Exemplary of such compounds are those wherein the alkanol is of 12 to 15 carbon atoms and which contain about 7 ethylene oxide groups per mole, e.g. Neodol 25-7 and Neodol 23-6.5, which products are made by Shell Chemical Company, Inc. The former is a condensation product of a mixture of higher fatty alcohols averaging about 12 to 15 carbon atoms, with about 7 moles of ethylene 10 oxide and the latter is a corresponding mixture wherein the carbon atoms content ofihe "higher fatty alcohol is 12 to 13 and the number of ethylene oxide groups present averages about 6.5. The higher alcohols are primary alkanols.<br>
Other useful nonionsos are represented by the commercially well-known class of 15 nonionics sole under the trademark Plurafac. The Plurafacs are the reaction products of a higher linear alcohol and a mixture of ethylene and propylene oxides, containing a mixed chain of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, terminated by a hydroxyl group. Examples include C13-C15 fatty alcohol condensed with 6 moles ethylene oxide and 3 moles propylene oxide, C13-C15 20 fatty alcohol condensed with 7 moles propylene oxide and 4 moles ethylene oxide, C13-C15 fatty alcohol condensed with 5 moles propylene oxide and 10 moles ethylene oxide, or mixtures of any of the above.<br>
Another group of liquid nonionics are commercially available from Shell 25 Chemical Company, Inc. under the Dobanol trademark: Dobanol 91-5 is an ethoxylated C9-C11 fatty alcohol with an average of 5 moles ethylene oxide and Dobanol 23-7 is an ethoxylated C12-C15 fatty alcohol with an average of 7 moles ethylene oxide per mole of fatty alcohol.<br>
30 In the compositions of this invention, preferred nonionic surfactants include the<br><br><br>
C12-C15 primary fatty alcohols with relatively narrow contents of ethylene oxide in the range of from about 7 to 9 moles, and the C9 to C11 fatty alcohols ethoxylated with 5-6 moles ethylene oxide.<br>
Another class of nonionic surfactants which can be used in accordance with this invention are glycoside surfactants. Glycoside surfactants suitable for use in accordance with the present invention include those of the formula:<br>
RO-R"O-y{Z)x<br>
wherein R is a monovalent organic radical containing from about 6 to about 30 (preferably from about 8 to about 18) carbon atoms; R" is a divalent hydrocarbon radical containing from about 2 to 4 carbons atoms; O is an oxygen atom; y is a number which can have an average value of from 0 to about 12 but which is most preferably zero; Z is a moiety derived from a reducing saccharide containing 5 or 6 carbon atoms; and x is a number having an average value of from 1 to 10 (preferably from about 1.5 to 10).<br>
A particularly preferred group of glycoside surfactants for use in the practice of this invention includes those of the formula above in which R is a monovalent  organic radical (linear or branched) containing from 6 to 18 (especially from 8 to 18) carbon atoms; y is zero; z is glucose or a moiety derived therefrom; x is a number having an average value of from 1 to 4.<br>
Nonionic surfactants particularly useful for this application include, but are not limited to: alcohol ethoxylates (e.g. Neodol 25-9 from Shell Chemical Co.), alkyl phenol ethoxylates (e.g. Tergitol NP-9 from Union Carbide Corp.), alkylpolyglucosides (e.g. Glucapon 600CS from Henkel Corp.), polyoxyethylenated polyoxypropylene glycols (e.g. Pluronic L-65 from BASF<br><br><br><br>
Corp.), sorbitol esters (e.g. Emsorb 2515 from Henkel Corp.), polyoxyethylenated sorbitol esters (e.g.; Emsorb 6900 from Henkel Corp.), alkanolamides (e.g. Alkamide DC212/SE from Rhone-Poulenc Co.), and N-alkylpyrrolidones (e.g. Surfadone LP-100 from ISP Technologies Inc.).<br>
Nonionic surfactant is used in the formulation from 0% to 70%, preferably between 5% and 50%, more preferably 10-40% by weight<br>
Mixtures of two or more of the nonionic surfactants can be used.<br>
Anionic Surfactant Detergents<br>
Anionic surface active agents which may be used in the present invention are those surface active compounds which contain a long chain hydrocarbon hydrophobic group in their molecular structure and a hydrophilic group, i.e.; water solubilizing group such as sulfonate or sulfate group. The anionic surface active agents include the alkali metal (e.g. sodium and potassium) water soluble higher alkyl benzene sulfonates, alkyl sulfonates, alkyl sulfates and the alkyl polyether sulfates. They may also include fatty acid or fatty acid soaps. The preferred anionic surface active agents are the alkali metal, ammonium or alkanolamide salts of higher alkyl benzene sulfonates and alkali metal, ammonium or alkanolamide salts of higher alkyl sulfonates. Preferred higher alkyl sulfonates are those in which the alkyl groups contain 8 to 26 carbon atoms, preferably 12 to 22 carbon atoms and more preferably 14 to 18 carbon atoms. The alkyl group in the alkyl benzene sulfonate preferably contains 8 to 16 carbon atoms and more preferably 10 to 15 carbon atoms. A particularly preferred alkyl benzene sulfonate is the sodium or potassium dodecyi benzene sulfonate, e.g. sodium linear dodecyi benzene sulfonate. The primary and secondary alkyl sulfonates can be made by reacting long chain alpha-olefins with sulfites or bisulfites, e.g. sodium bisulfite. The alkyl sulfonates can also be<br><br><br>
made by reacting long chain normal paraffin hydrocarbons with sulfur dioxide<br>
and oxygen as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,503,280, 2,507,088, 3,372,188<br>
and 3,260,741 to obtain normal or secondary higher alkyl sulfonates suitable for<br>
use as surfactant detergents.<br>
5	<br>
The alkyl substituent is preferably linear, i.e. normal alkyl however, branched chain alkyl sulfonates can be employed, although they are not as good with respect to biodegradability. The alkane, i.e. alkyl, substituent may be terminally sulfonated or may be joined, for example, to the carbon atom of the chain, i.e.<br>
10 may be a secondary sulfonate. It is understood in the art that the substituent may be joined to any carbon on the alkyl chain. The higher alky! sulfonates can be used as the alkali metal salts, such as sodium and potassium. The preferred salts are the sodium salts. The preferred alkyl sulfonates are the C10 to C18 primary normal alkyl sodiurn and potassium sulfonates, with the C10 to C15<br>
15 primary normal alkyl sulfonate salt being more preferred.<br>
Mixtures of higher alkyl benzene sulfonates and higher alkyl sulfonates can be used as well as mixtures of higher alkyl benzene sulfonates and higher alkyl polyether sulfates. 20<br>
The alkali metal alkyl benzene sulfonate can be used in an amount of 0 to 70%, preferably 10 to 50% and more preferably 10 to 20% by weight.<br>
The alkali metal sulfonate can be used in admixture with the alkylbenzene 2 5 sulfonate in an amount of 0 to 70%, preferably 10 to 50% by weight.<br>
Also normal alkyl and branched chain alkyl sulfates (e.g., primary alkyl sulfates) may be used as the anionic component).<br>
30 The higher alkyl polyether sulfates used in accordance with the present<br><br><br>
invention can be normal or branched chain alkyl and contain lower alkoxy groups which can contain two or three carbon atoms. The normal higher alkyl polyether sulfates are preferred in that they have a higher degree of biodegradability than the branched chain alkyl and the lower poly alkoxy groups 5 are preferably ethoxy groups.<br>
The preferred higher alkyl poly ethoxy sulfates used in accordance with the present invention are represented by the formula:<br>
10	R,-O(CH2CH2O)p-SO3M,<br>
where R" is C8 to C20 alkyl, preferably C10 to C18 and more preferably C12 to C15; P is 2 to 8, preferably 2 to 6, and more preferably 2 to 4; and M is an alkali metal, such as sodium and potassium, or an ammonium cation. The sodium 15 and potassium salts are preferred.<br>
A preferred higher alkyl poly ethoxylated sulfate is the sodium salt of a triethoxy C12 to C15 alcohol sulfate having the formula:<br>
20	C12.15-O-(CH2CH2O)3-SO3Na<br>
Examples of suitable alkyl ethoxy sulfates that can be used in accordance with the present invention are C12-15 normal or primary alkyl triethoxy sulfate, sodium salt; n-decyl diethoxy sulfate, sodium salt; C12 primary alkyl diethoxy sulfate, 25 ammonium salt; C12 primary alkyl triethoxy sulfate, sodium salt: C15 primary alkyl tetraethoxy sulfate, sodium salt, mixed C14-15 normal primary alkyl mixed tri- and tetraethoxy sulfate, sodium salt; stearyl pentaethoxy sulfate, sodium salt; and mixed C10-18 normal primary alkyl triethoxy sulfate, potassium salt.<br>
30 The normal alkyl ethoxy sulfates are readily biodegradable and are preferred.<br><br><br>
The alkyl poly-lower alkoxy sulfates can be used in mixtures with each other and/or in mixtures with the above discussed higher alkyl benzene, alkyl sulfonates, or alkyl sulfates.<br>
The alkali metal higher alkyl poly ethoxy sulfate can be used with the alkylbenzene sulfonate and/or with an alkyl sulfonate or sulfonate, in an amount of 0 to 70%, preferably 10 to 50% and more preferably 10 to 20% by weight of entire composition.<br>
Anionic surfactants particularly useful for this application include, but are not limited to: linear alkyl benzene sulfonates (e.g. Vista C-500 from Vista Chemical Co.), alkyl sulfates (e.g. Polystep B-5 from Stepan Co.), polyoxyethylenated alkyl sulfates (e.g. Standapol ES-3 from Stepan Co.), alpha olefin sulfonates (e.g. Witconate AOS from WItco Corp.), alpha sulfo methyl esters (e.g. Alpha-Step MC-48 from Stepan Co.) and isethionates (e.g. Jordapon CI from PPG Industries Inc.).<br>
Anionic surfactant is used in the formulation from 0% to 60%, preferably between 5% and 40%, more preferably 8 to 25% by weight.<br>
Cationic Surfactants<br>
Many cationic surfactants are known in the art, and almost any cationic surfactant having at least one tong chain alkyl group of 10 to 24 carbon atoms is suitable in the present invention. Such compounds are described in "Cationic<br>
I	.   ., ;<br>
Surfactants", Jungermann, 1970, incorporated by reference.<br>
Specific cationic surfactants which can be used as surfactants in the subject invention are described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 4,497,718.<br><br><br>
As with the nonionic and anionic surfactants, the compositions of the invention may use cationic surfactants alone or in combination with any of the other surfactants known in the art. Of course, the compositions may contain no cationic surfactants at all.<br>
Amphoteric Surfactants<br>
Ampholytic synthetic detergents can be broadly described as derivatives of aliphatic or aliphatic derivatives of heterocyclic secondary and tertiary amines in which the aliphatic radical may be a straight chain or a branched and wherein one of the aliphatic substituents contains from 8 to 18 carbon atoms and at least one contains an anionic water-solubilizing group, e.g. carboxy, sulfonate, sulfate. Examples of compounds falling within this definition are sodium 3(dodecylamino)propionate, sodium 3-(dodecylamino)propane-1 -sulfonate, sodium 2-(dodecylamino)ethy! sulfate, sodium 2-<br>
i<br>
 (dimethylamino)octadecanoate, disodium 3-{N-carboxymethyldodecyJamino)propane 1-sulfonate, disodium octadecyl-imminodiacetate, sodium l-carboxymethyl-2-undecylimidazole, and sodium N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-sulfato-3-dodecoxypropylamine. Sodium 3-<br>
 {dodecyiamino)propane-1 -sulfonate is preferred.<br>
Zwitterionic surfactants can be broadly described as derivatives of secondary and tertiary amines, derivatives of heterocyclic secondary and tertiary amines, or derivatives of quaternary ammonium, quaternary phosphonium or tertiary sulfonium compounds. The cationic atom in the quaternary compound can be part of a heterocyclic ring. In all of these compounds there is at least one aliphatic group, straight chain or branched, containing from 3 to 18 carbon atoms and at least one aliphatic substituent containing an anionic water solubilizing group, e.g., carboxy, sulfonate, sulfate, phosphate, or phosphonate.<br>
Specific examples of zwitterionic surfactants which may be used are set forth in<br><br><br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,062,647.<br>
The amount of amphoteric used may vary from 0 to 50% by weight, preferably 1 to 30% by weight<br>
It should be noted that the compositions of the invention are preferably isotropic (by which is generally understood to be a homogenous phase when viewed macroscopically) and either transparent or translucent.<br>
Total surfactant used must be at least 10%, preferably at least 15%, more preferably at least 20% by wt<br>
Builders/Electrolyte<br>
Builders which can be used according to this invention include conventional alkaline detergency builders, inorganic or organic, which can be used at levels from 0% to 50% by weight of the composition, preferably from 3% to 35% by weight.<br>
As used herein, the term electrolyte means any water-soluble salt.<br>
Preferably the composition comprises at least 1.0% by weight; more preferably<br>
at least 5.0% by weight, most preferably at least 10,0% by weight of electrolyte.<br>
The electrolyte may also be a detergency builder, such as the inorganic builder  sodium tripolyphosphate, or it may be a non-functional electrolyte such as<br>
sodium sulfate or chloride. Preferably the inorganic builder comprises all or part  of the electrolyte.<br>
The composition may comprise at least 1%, preferably at least 3%, preferably  3% to as much as 50% by weight electrolyte.<br><br><br>
The compositions of the invention are capable of suspending particulate solids, although particularly preferred are those systems where such solids are actually in suspension. The solids may be undissolved electrolyte, the same as or different from the electrolyte in solution, the latter being saturated electrolyte. Additionally, or alternatively, they may be materials which are substantially insoluble in water alone. Examples of such substantially insoluble materials are aluminosilicate builders and particles of calcite abrasive.<br>
Examples of suitable inorganic alkaline detergency builders which may be used are water-soluble alkali metal phosphates, polyphosphates, borates, silicates and also carbonates. Specific examples of such salts are sodium and potassium triphosphates, pyrophosphates, orthophosphates, hexametaphosphates, tetraborates, silicates, and carbonates.<br>
Examples of suitable organic alkaline detergency builder salts are: (1) water-soluble amino polycarboxylates, e.g., sodium and potassium ethylenediaminetetraacetates, nitrilotriacetates and N-(2 hydroxyethyl)-nitrilodiacetates; (2) water-soluble salts of phytic acid, e.g., sodium and potassium phytates<see u.s. pat no. water-soluble polyphosphonates including specifically sodium potassium and lithium salts of ethane-1-hydroxy-1 acid methylene diphosphonic ethylene ethane-1 acid. other examples include the alkali metal ethane-2-carboxy-1 hydroxymethanediphosphonic carboxyldiphosphonic etnane-1-hydroxy-1 ethane-2-hydroxy-1 propane-1 polycarboxylates polymers copolymers as described in patent></see><br><br>

These synthetic aluminosilicates are more fully described in British Patent No. 1,429,143.<br>
Enzymes<br>
Enzymes which may be used in the subject invention are described in greater detail below.<br>
If a lipase is used, the lipolytic enzyme may be either a fungal lipase producible<br><br><br>
by Humicola lanuginosa and Thermomyces lanuginosus, or a bacterial lipase which show a positive immunological cross-reaction with the antibody of the lipase produced by the microorganism Chromobacter viscosum var. lipolyticum NRRL B-3673. This rnicroorganism has been described in Dutch patent 5 specification 154,269 of Toyo Jozo Kabushiki Kaisha and has been deposited with the Fermentation Research institute, Agency of Industrial Science and Technology, Ministry of International Trade and Industry, Tokyo, Japan, and added to the permanent collection under nr. KO Hatsu Ken Kin Ki 137 and is available to the public at the United States Department of Agriculture,<br>
10 Agricultural Research Service, Northern Utilization and Development Division al Peoria, III., USA, under the nr. NRRL B-3673. The lipase produced by this microorganism is commercially available from Toyo Jozo Co., Tagata, Japan, hereafter referred to as "TJ lipase". These bacterial lipases should show a positive immunological cross-reaction with the TJ lipase antibody, using the<br>
15 standard and well-known immune diffusion procedure according to Ouchterloiiy (Acta. Med. Scan., 133. pages 76-79 (1930).<br>
The preparation of the antiserum is carried out as follows:<br>
20 Equal volumes of 0.1 mg/ml antigen and of Freund"s adjuvant (complete or incomplete) are mixed until an emulsion is obtained. Two female rabbits are injected 45 with 2 ml samples of the emulsion according to the following scheme:<br>
day 0: antigen in complete Freund"s adjuvant<br>
25	day 4: antigen in complete Freund"s adjuvant<br>
day 32: antigen in incomplete Freund"s adjuvant<br>
day 64: booster of antigen in incomplete Freund"s adjuvant<br>
The serum containing the required antibody is prepared by centrifugation of 30 clotted blood, taken on day 67.<br><br><br>
The titre of the anti-TJ-lipase antiserum is determined by the inspection of precipitation of serial dilutions of antigen and antiserum according to the Ouchteriony procedure. A dilution of antiserum was the dilution that still gave a 5 visible precipitation with an antigen concentration of 0.1 mg/ml.<br>
All bacterial lipases showing a positive immunological cross reaction with the TJ-lipase antibody as hereabove described are lipases suitable in this embodiment of the invention. Typical examples thereof are the lipase ex<br>
10 Pseudomonas fluorescens 1AM 1057 (available from Amano Pharmaceutical Co., Nagoya, Japan, under the trade-name Amano-P lipase), the lipase ex Pseudomonas fragi PERM P 1339 (available under the trade-name Amano B), the lipase ex Pseudomonas nitroreducens var. lipolyticum FERM PI 338, the lipase ex Pseudomonas sp. (available under the trade-name Amano CES), the<br>
15 lipase ex Pseudomonas cepacia, lipases ex Chromobacter viscosum, e.g. Chromobacter viscosum var. lipolyticum NRRL B-3673, commercially available from Toyo Jozo Co., Tagata, Japan; and further Chromobacter viscosum lipases from U.S. Biochemical Corp.

Set the wavelength.<br>
type in the desired wavelength on the keypad (i.e., 590, 640, etc.)<br>
press the [second function] key<br>
press the "go to 8" [yes] key<br>
machine is then ready to read at the chosen wavelength.<br>

press the [second function] key<br>
press the "zero A" [% T/A/C]<br>
instrumentshould then read "XXX NM 0.000 A T"<br>
4.	Open the cover, place sample vertically and in front of the sonsor.<br>
5.	Close the lid and record reading (ex. 640 NM 0.123 A T)<br>

Synthetic Sunlight Box<br>
(apparatus used for examples; used only for UVA and UVB range)<br>
Box dimensions and appearance: Length 1.2m (4 ft.) Width 0.61m (2 ft.) Height 0.61m (2 ft.)<br>
Constructed of 19.5mm (3/4") plywood. Box sits approximately 50.8mm (2 inches) off ground for air circulation. A small fan is located in the cover of the box. Four lamps are mounted on the long side of the box; two on each side set approximately 6 inches apart.<br>
Fan is included so as to maintain the internal temperature throughout the duration of an experiment. This ensures that any effects seen are the result of ultraviolet light alone and not heat.<br>
Samples are placed in open containers and put in box. Open containers are used so as to limit interference of the container material on the light rays. An open container of water is added to the box as well. This water keeps atmosphere at a constant humidity and slows evaporation from the open samples. After a given period of time, samples are removed from the box, reconsidered for the evaporation of water and tested for UV effects.<br>
Accelerated Weathering:<br>
From "sunlight, UV and Accelerated Weathering" Technical Bulletin LU-0822<br>
and QUV Accelerated Weathering Testers form Q-panel Lab Products.<br>
Sunlight is an important cause of damage to plastics, textiles, paints and other organic materials. Although UV light makes up only about 5% of sunlight, it is<br><br><br><br>
responsible for most of the photochemical damage. This is because the photochemical effectiveness of light increases with decreasing wavelength. Short wavelength ultraviolet light has long been recognized as responsible for most of this damage. Accelerated weathering testers are widely used for 5 research and development, quality control, and material certification. They employ a variety of light sources to simulate sunlight and the damage cause by sunlight.<br>
To simulate the damage cause by sunlight it is not necessary to reproduce the entire spectrum of sunlight. For most materials, it is only necessary to simulate the short wavelength UV. For our specific purposes, the UVA-340 lamp was chosen. Most of this lamp"s emission in the UV-A region, with a small amount in the UV-B. This lamp is an excellent simulation of sunlight from about 370 nm, down to the solar cut-off of 295 nm.<br>
EXAMPLE t<br>
The samples of liquid detergents (set forth in Table 1 below) containing protease and lipase were added to 5" diameter glass dishes with the top off and<br>
20 exposed to UV light of 254 nm and 110 microwatt/cm2 (at 28" from the light source for 5 days). After each 24 hour period, the samples were weighed and topped off to replace evaporated water. Enzyme activity in the samples exposed to UV light was measured using proper substrates (e.g., casein as a protease substrate and p-nitrophenolvalerate as a lipase substrate).   Percent<br>
25 remaining activity was calculated based on the initial activity in the sample prior to UV exposure.   The formulation was as below.<br><br>
