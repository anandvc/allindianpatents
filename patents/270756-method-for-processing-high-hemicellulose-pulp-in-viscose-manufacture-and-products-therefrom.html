				<td>METHOD FOR PROCESSING HIGH HEMICELLULOSE PULP IN VISCOSE MANUFACTURE AND PRODUCTS THEREFROM<br>
FIELD<br>
The present application relates to a method for using high hemicellulose pulps in viscose manufacture and the resulting fibers therefrom.<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
Pulp used for rayon manufacture has a high alpha cellulose content generally in the range of 88 to 98 percent where alpha cellulose represents the insoluble fraction of pulp that is not dissolved when pulp is treated with 17.5% sodium hydroxide. Such pulps are termed dissolving pulps. To achieve this degree of purity, manufacturers must remove a substantial amount of the hemicellulose by, for example, steam prehydrolysis prior to cooking a Kraft pulp, or by cold caustic extraction in the bleaching process, thereby adding substantially to the cost of manufacture. A high percent of pentosans and other hemicelluloses are objectionable in rayon grade pulps due to problems they cause in filtration, spinning, fiber properties and also because they are an indication that the morphological structure of the pulp has not been altered sufficiently to obtain the desired reactivity.<br>
Briefly, the viscose process is as follows. Steeping, or mercerization, requires 18% sodium hydroxide and is carried out either in sheet steeping in hydraulic presses with perforated steel plates in batches of cellulose sheets vertically inserted , or as slurry steeping where a slurry of fibers in approximately 18 percent caustic is prepared. The former operation is batchwise and the excess caustic is removed by draining the caustic and then pressing the alkali cellulose to a fixed press weight ratio. The slurry steeping operation is continuous or batch and is followed by pressing of the slurry by, for example, perforated roll presses or vacuum filters with press rolls. At this point the alkali cellulose contains about 30 percent cellulose and 15 percent sodium hydroxide. It is then shredded, either batchwise in cooled sigma blade shredders, or continuously in disc shredders to alkali cellulose crumb. The alkali cellulose crumb is then aged in a controlled manner at 15 -40°C for a fixed time depending on the end product use to reduce the degree of polymerization in the range of 400 to 600. Xanthation is then conducted in churns or barettes whereby carbon disulfide is charged into the vessel. Approximately three hours are required at 20 - 35°C to give a degree of substitution of the xanthate group of about 0.4 - 0.5. The xanthate crumb is then dissolved in caustic to give viscose which contains cellulose in the form of cellulose xanthate.<br>
Dissolution is performed in vessels equipped with paddle stirrers. The viscose is ripened, filtered and deaerated prior to regeneration. Cellulose is regenerated by extrusion of the viscose into coagulation baths, one or two in series, containing sulfuric acid and such salts as sodium sulfate, bisulfate, and bisulfite, magnesium sulfate, ammonium sulfate and zinc sulfate. The composition of the baths varies with the effects desired. A typical bath contains about 130 g/1 H2SO4, 280 g/1 Na2SO4, 15 g/1 Zn SO4 and 60 g/1 glucose. If two baths are used in series the second one is acidic to complete the regeneration, whereas the first can be either acidic or a mainly salt bath. The temperature of the coagulation baths is kept at around 50°C, spinning speed is around 100 m/min and the bath travel is normally around 25 cm or longer. The spinneret holes vary in diameter from 0.05 to 0.30 mm. The number of filaments per thread varies from 10 to 1,000 and in the case of rayon staple fiber, up to 50,000. The emerging yarn is stretched by godet wheels at different speed differentials and subsequently wound on a rotating bobbin or collected as a as a centrifugal cake in a rotating bucket or fed to a cutter. The bobbins, cakes or cut staple fibers are then washed, desulfurized, bleached, and finishing treatment applied.<br>
Cellophane manufacture follows the same pattern as textile yarns up to the stage of coagulation, with small changes in the caustic handling system. The viscose is extruded through a slit into one or two coagulation baths the first of which may only contain salts. The cellophane web passes through finishing baths, one of which contains glycerol or other plasticizers and finally into a dryer section and then further modified in the converting industry such as laminating, printing and combination with plastic films, metal foils, paper or board.<br>
It has now been shown that an experimental non dissolving grade pulp with high hemicellulose levels, (hereinafter called pulp with high hemicellulose levels), and consequently lower cost, can be used in the viscose process to achieve fiber properties which are comparable to those of dissolving pulps. In the process, the high hemicellulose pulp is blended with a dissolving grade pulp in either the sheet steeping process or the slurry process.<br>
The term hemicellulose refers to a heterogeneous group of low molecular weight carbohydrate polymers that are associated with cellulose in wood. Hemicelluloses are amorphous, branched polymers, in contrast to cellulose which is a linear polymer. The principal, simple sugars that combine to form hemicelluloses are D-glucose, D-xylose, D-mannose, L-arabinose, D-galactose, D-glucuronic acid and D-galacturonic acid. As used herein, hemicellulose refers to the weight percent of xylan and mannan in oven dry pulp. In one embodiment a high hemicelluose pulp contains at least about 12 percent by weight<br>
hemicellulose, In another embodiment the pulp contains at least about 10 percent by weight hemicellulose. The term high hemicellulose means at least 10 percent by weight hemicellulose, in pulp based on oven dry weight of pulp. Oven dry weight means the pulp was dried at 105°C for at least one hour.<br>
In one embodiment a high hemicellulose pulp is blended with a dissolving pulp in the sheet steeping process. The two different pulps can be placed in sheet form in separate compartments in the steeping press or they can be placed in separate steeping presses. In either case, after steeping and pressing the sheets to a fixed press weight ratio, (PWR), the pulp is shredded to yield alkali cellulose crumb. The alkali cellulose crumb from the separate steeping presses can be mixed to yield a blended alkali cellulose crumb. Blending can be accomplished either after shredding the alkali cellulose sheets and then aging or after aging the alkali cellulose from each of the two different pulps to a given D.P. of the cellulose. D.P. refers to the degree of polymerization and represents the number of D-glucose monomers in a cellulose molecule. In one embodiment the pulp with high hemicellulose levels is blended with the dissolving grade pulp at a 50 percent level, or less, by total dry weight of pulp; in another embodiment pulp with high hemicellulose levels is blended with the dissolving grade pulp at a level of 35 percent, or less, by total dry weight of pulp; in another embodiment the pulp with high hemicellulose levels is blended with the dissolving grade pulp at a 20 percent level, or less, by total dry weight of pulp; in yet another embodiment the pulp with high hemicellulose levels is blended with the dissolving pulp at a level of 10 percent, or less, by total dry weight of pulp. Typical properties of two pulps with high hemicellulose levels are presented in Table 1; Table 2, 2A, 3 and 3A represent pulp and viscose processing properties of various pulp blends.<br>

Fiber properties of viscose preparations made from blends of pulp are at least equal to those of the dissolving pulp, Table 2A and 3 A. In one embodiment the tensile strength of the fibers prepared from a viscose containing high hemicellulose pulp are at least equal to those prepared from a dissolving grade pulp. In another embodiment the tensile strength of the fibers prepared from a viscose containing blends of the pulp with high hemicellulose levels and a dissolving grade pulp are at least equal to those prepared from a dissolving grade pulp alone. Elongation and modulus of fibers prepared only from the pulps with high hemicellulose, designated as EK and EF, are at least equal to the dissolving grade pulps. In one embodiment the elongation of the fibers prepared from a viscose containing pulp with high hemicellulose levels are at least equal to those prepared from a dissolving grade pulp alone. In another embodiment the modulus of the fibers prepared from a viscose containing pulp with high hemicellulose levels and a dissolving grade pulp are at least equal to those prepared from a dissolving grade pulp alone.<br>
The chemical composition of the viscose fibers is given in Table 4.<br><br>

In another embodiment the pulps are blended in a slurry process. In this case the pulp with high hemicellulose levels and the dissolving grade pulps can be added separately in sheet form to the alkaline medium and then mixed thoroughly to obtain a homogeneous fibrous slurry. Alternatively, each pulp can be added to separate steeping vessels, in sheet form, followed by disintegration in the steeping vessel, steeping the pulp, pressing the alkali cellulose (AC) after removal of the alkaline medium, and subsequently shredding the alkali cellulose for conversion to an alkali cellulose crumb. At this point the shredded alkali cellulose crumb can either be blended subsequent to shredding and aged as a uniform alkali cellulose blend or can be aged separately to a given D.P. and then blended. Alkali cellulose and viscose properties are shown in Table 5.<br>

In one embodiment in the slurry process, the pulp with high hemicellulose levels is blended with the dissolving grade pulp at a 50 percent level, or less, by total dry weight of pulp; in another embodiment the pulp with high hemicellulose levels is blended with the dissolving grade pulp at a level of 35 percent, or less, by total dry weight of pulp; in another embodiment the pulp with high hemicellulose levels is blended with the dissolving grade pulp at a 20 percent level, or less, by total dry weight of pulp; in yet another embodiment the pulp with high hemicellulose levels is blended with the dissolving grade pulp at a level of 10 percent, or less, by total dry weight of pulp.<br>
The dissolving pulps used for blending with the non dissolving grade pulp with high hemicellulose pulps can be either Kraft, sulfite, or cotton linters. Kraft and sulfite pulps can be made from southern or northern softwoods. Commercially available pulp used in this work included the following, a sulfite pulp from Saiccor with an S18 of 6.01%, an S10 of 9.94% and a hemicellulose level of ~ 2.3 %; a Beech sulfite pulp from Lenzing with an S18 of 7.45%, an S10 of 11.72% and a hemicellulose level of 3.59 %; a prehydrolyzed kraft pulp from Buckeye with an S18 of 5.43 %, an S10 of 8.18% and a hemicellulose level of 3.19%; an experimental modified Kraft pulp made from sawdust with an S18 of 15.23%, an Sioof 16.81% and a hemicellulose level of -12.5 %, designated as EK; and an experimental modified Kraft pulp for viscose made from southern pine chips with an Sig of 13.78% an S10 of 16.01% and a hemicellulose level of -12.5 designated as EF pulp. Analytical properties of all pulps used are shown in Tables 2 and 3.<br>
S18 as defined herein is 100- % R18 where R18 refers to the residual amount of undissolved material left after attempting to dissolve the pulp in an 18% caustic solution and is expressed as a percent. S10 as defined herein is 100- % R10 where R10 refers to the residual amount of undissolved material left after attempting to dissolve the pulp in 10% caustic solution and is expressed as a percent. Generally, in a 10% caustic solution, hemicellulose and chemically degraded short chain cellulose are dissolved and removed in solution. In contrast, generally only hemicellulose is dissolved and removed in an 18% caustic solution. Thus, the difference between the R10 value and the R18 value represents the amount of chemically degraded short chained cellulose that is present in the pulp sample. R10 value and the Revalues were determined by TAPPI 235. The percent hemicellulose was determined by  the method described in this application and represents the sum of the percent mannan and xylan in the pulp or fiber.<br>
The modified Kraft pulp with high hemicellulose, designated as EF, can be made in a commercial continuous extended delignification process in the laboratory utilizing a specially built reactor vessel with associated auxiliary equipment, including circulating pumps, accumulators, and direct heat exchangers, etc. Reactor temperatures can be controlled by indirect heating and continuous circulation of cooking liquor. In the process, the reactor vessel is charged with a standard quantity of equivalent moisture free wood. An optional atmospheric pre-steaming step may be carried out prior to cooking. A quantity of cooking liquor, ranging from about 50% to 80% of the total, is then charged to the digester along with dilution water to achieve the target liquor to wood ratio. The reactor is then brought to impregnation temperature and pressure and allowed to remain for the target time. Following the impregnation period, an additional portion of the total cooking liquor is added to the reactor vessel, ranging from about 5% to 15% of the total. The reactor is then brought to cooking temperature and allowed to remain there for the target time period to simulate the co-current portion of the cook.<br>
Following the co-current portion of the cook, the remainder of the cooking liquor can be added to the reactor vessel at a fixed rate. The rate is dependent on the target time period and proportion of cooking liquor used for this step of the cook. The reactor can be controlled at a target cooking temperature and allowed to remain there during the simulation of the counter-current portion of the cook. Spent cooking liquor can then be withdrawn from the reactor into an external collection container at the same fixed rate. At the end of the cook, the reactor vessel is slowly depressurized and allowed to cool below the flash point. The reactor vessel is then opened and the cooked wood chips collected, drained of liquor, washed, screened and made ready for testing. Typical conditions which can be used to make a modified Kraft pulp from southern pine chips that have high hemicellulose levels and designated as EK pulp in this application are given in Table 6.<br>

In another example, low specific gravity wood having a specific gravity of 0.410 was pulped using the Kraft process and subsequently bleached and treated with varying amounts of oxygen to reduce its viscosity. Components in the pulps made using low specific gravity wood chips are 7.2% xylans and 5.5% mannans for a total hemicellulose level of 12.7% by weight hemicellulose.<br>

PULP PREPARATION FOR USE IN SHEET STEEPING Pulp sheets, blended in the ratios shown in Tables 2, 2A, 3, and 3A were prepared with the modified Kraft pulps designated as EF pulp, prepared from southern pine chips and the modified Kraft pulp designated as EK pulp, prepared from northern softwood sawdust as follows. The appropriate amounts of dissolving pulp and high hemicellulose pulp, based on oven dry weight, and the ratios indicated in Tables 2, 2A, 3 and 3A were dispersed in water at a 3% consistency with a Lightning mixer. The resulting fibrous slurry was dewatered through a 30.5 cm x 30.5 cm. screen, the dewatered mat pressed twice in a TAPPI press, and steam dried to make a 750 g/m2, 0.55 g/cm3 sheet. As an example, an 85 % PHK 15 % EK means that the pulp sheet contained 85 % by total oven dry weight PHK pulp and 15 % by total oven dry weight of the non dissolving grade pulp with high hemicellulose.<br>
PULP PREPARATION FOR USE IN SLURRY STEEPING<br>
A fibrous mixture of a dissolving pulp and the non dissolving grade pulp with the high hemicellulose, designated as EF pulp, prepared from southern pine chips and a fibrous mixture of a dissolving grade pulp and the pulp with the high hemicellulose levels, designated as EK pulp, were prepared from northern softwood sawdust follows. The appropriate amounts of dissolving pulp and high hemicellulose pulp, based on oven dry weight, and the ratios indicted in Table 5 were dispersed in water at a 3 % consistency with a Lightning mixer. The resulting fibrous slurry was dewatered, centrifuged, fluffed with a pin mill and air dried. The resulting fluffed pulp fibers were used for slurry steeping.<br>
Sheet Steeping<br>
Steeping was conducted in a steeping press using 12-14 sheets of the blended pulp, shown in Tables 2, and 3 and 18 % caustic at ambient temperature for 40 minutes. The sheets were pressed out in a Blashke press to a press weight ratio (PWR) in 60 seconds at a pressure of 30 bar. Press weight ratio (PWR) is defined as the final weight of the alkali cellulose divided by the initial oven dry weight of cellulose. Oven dry weight is the weight of a sample after drying at 105°C for at least one hour.<br>
Shredding / Aging<br>
The alkali cellulose sheets were shredded through a laboratory refiner and the shredded alkali cellulose crumb was aged at 28°C to reach a target D.P. (CED, cupriethylenediamine solution) of 580. D.P. was determined by SCAN-CM-15:88. In the test, commercial cupriethylenediamene (cuene) solution, 1 mol/1 was used at a concentration of 0.2% in a 50/50 mixture cuene (1 mol/1) /water at 25 °C. The formula for the D.P. were as<br>
follows, D.P. 950: η = 2.28 x D.P.076. Alkali and cellulose in AC were determined as follows. Five g of AC and 25 ml. of IN H2SO4 were mixed in a flask and diluted with water after 15 minutes. After an additional 5 minutes the mixture was titrated with 1 N NaOH using methyl orange as indicator. The percent alkali was calculated<br>
(25-c)x4 as_where c is the concentration of NaOH, and W is the sample weight. Cellulose<br>
      W<br>
in AC was determined by thoroughly washing the precipitated cellulose of the AC analysis on a fritted funnel and drying the cellulose at 105°C. The percent cellulose was calculated as<br>
w x 100     where w is the weight of the dried sample and W is the weight of the AC.<br>
W<br>
Xanthation / Dissolution/ Filtration<br>
The AC (alkali cellulose) crumb was dry xanthated in a rotating bottle. AC crumb was introduced into the bottle and the bottle evacuated. CS2, 28 weight percent on dry cellulose was introduced into the bottle, and xanthation allowed to proceed for 1.5 hr. at 28°C.<br>
Dissolution of the cellulose xanthate was conducted by mixing the xanthate crumb with caustic containing 0.1% hemicellulose for 2 hours at 2-12°C to make an 8.5% cellulose, 6% caustic 28 % CS2 viscose solution. The viscose solution for spinning was filtered using Southwest Screens and Filters (Belgium) with three filter screens with openings of 20, 10, and 5 μm respectively. For filterability, a 400 ml tube is filled with viscose and a pressure of 2 bar is applied over a surface area of 4 cm2 using a filter paper with an air permeability of 15 + /- 2 1/min. In the test, the quantity of viscose filtered in the first 20 minutes is measured in grams (a), and then in the next 20 to 60 minutes the viscose is measured in grams (b). Based on these values, the filterability is calculated as KW =100000 x (2-b/a) / (a+b). KR is the viscosity corrected filterability according to the following equation, KR=F x KW/η°4 where η is the ball fall time of a 3.18 mm ball in seconds and F is the filter surface area of 4 cm2. A good filterability range for KW and KR is 500 and less. The viscose was ripened at 20 to 25°C to the 8°H range. H is the Hottenroth degree or number and represents the number of milliliters of 10% ammonium chloride that is necessary to add to a diluted viscose to induce incipient coagulation under standard conditions. In the test, 20 g of viscose was diluted with 30 ml water and titrated with 10% ammonium chloride solution to coagulation. The Degree of Substitution (D.S.) of the xanthate group was determined on viscose immediately after completion of mixing. Ball fall viscosity, filtration value and particle count were determined after 20 hours of ripening. Ball fall viscosity is the time required in seconds for a 3.18 mm steel ball to fall 20 cm in viscose in a 20 cm. diameter cylinder at 20 °C. Particle count was<br>
determined with PAMAS particle counter. The D.S. (degree of substitution) of the xanthate group was determined as follows. One gram of viscose is dissolved in 100 ml cold water and then, under cooling, CO2 is fed into the solution to the point where hydrogen sulfide is not detected with lead acetate (2) paper in the CO2 stream. The solution is then titrated with 0.02% Iodine - solution using starch as indicator. The gamma value is calculated as (a x 32.4)/W x b, where a is the volume of 0.02 percent iodine - solution, b is the cellulose in viscose and W is the sample weight. The alkali and cellulose in viscose were determined as follows. Two to three grams of viscose were accurately weighed and dissolved in 100 ml. water. Twenty ml. of 0.5 N H2SO4 was added and the mixture shaken. The mixture was titrated after 30 minutes with 0.5 N NaOH using methyl red as indicator and the alkali<br>
(20 - a) x 2<br>
content calculated as follows % alkali = _________ where a is the volume of 0.5 N NaOH<br>
W<br>
consumed and W is the weight of the viscose sample. The cellulose content in viscose was determined by accurately weighing 3 grams of viscose onto a slide and the viscose pressed to a thin film with a second slide. The two slides are separated and each slide dried for 15 min. at 50°C, then immersed in a bath containing 10 % H2SO4 The films are then washed thoroughly and dried at 105°C and the cellulose content in the viscose calculated.<br>
Spinning<br>
The viscose was spun through a 40 hole spinnerette with 70 μm holes into a coagulation bath of 80 g/1 sulfuric acid, 240 g/1 sodium sulfate and 30 g/1 zinc sulfate at 48°C. A decomposition bath containing 50 g/1 sulfuric acid and 20 g/1 sodium sulfate was used. The single fiber titer was 2.8 dtex. Washing was conducted on the first mating roll at ambient temperature and on mating rolls two and three at 60°C. The filaments were finished with Stocko MW 5866. Two rolls were dried at once at a temperature of 100°C to 70°C. Shrinkage was 1.5%, draw ratio 1.2 and a spinning speed of 40 m/min.<br>
Slurry Steeping<br>
In cases where Saiccor pulp was blended with EF pulp, each pulp was first dispersed in water, the two fibrous mixtures then blended into a single mixture, stirred, dewatered, and made into sheets. The resulting sheets were air dried and then a fixed weight of pulp introduced into the slurry steeping vessel containing 17.8 percent sodium hydroxide, stirred to disintegrate the sheets, and steeped for 30 minutes at 45°C. In the case where PHK pulp was used, the pulp was first cut into 1.25 x 1.25 crn. squares and then disintegrated together with the EF pulp, in sheet form, in the slurry medium. The resulting slurry was then processed as previously described. In both cases, the resulting slurry was drained to recover<br>
the alkali cellulose and then pressed to a PWR of 2.95. The pressed alkali cellulose was then shredded in a high speed shredder to yield alkali cellulose crumb. The AC crumb was aged at 46.5°C and viscosity determined by TAPPI T25. Xanthation was conducted with 28% by weight carbon disulfide on dry weight of cellulose basis for 60 minutes at 31°C. The resulting xanthate crumb was dissolved in caustic to make a 9.0/5.5/28 composition viscose. The resulting viscose solution was ripened at 18°C and filterability determined on the ripened viscose using a filter pack containing one piece of muslin cloth, one piece of Whatman 54 filter paper and two pieces of canton flannel. The muslin and flannel were obtained from Celanese Corp. of America. In the method the volume of filtrate is recorded every ten minutes and a graph of time vs. time/volume is plotted to obtain a slope.<br>

PROCEDURE<br>
Sample Preparation<br>
Grind 0.2 ±05 g sample with Wiley Mill 40 Mesh screen size. Transfer -200 mg of sample<br>
into 40-mL Teflon container and cap. Dry overnight in the vacuum oven at 50°C.<br>
Add 1.0 mL 72% H2SO4 to test tube with the Brinkman dispenser. Stir and crush with the<br>
rounded end of a glass or Teflon stirring rod for one minute. Turn on heat for Gyrotory<br>
Water-Bath Shaker. The settings are as follows:<br>
Heat: High<br>
Control Thermostat: 7°C<br>
Safety thermostat: 25°C<br>
Speed: Off<br>
Shaker: Off<br>
Place the test tube rack in gyrotory water-bath shaker. Stir each sample 3 times, once between<br>
20-40 min, again between 40-60 min, and again between 60-80 min. Remove the sample after<br>
90 min. Dispense 1.00 mL of internal standard (Fucose) into Kraft samples.<br>
Tightly cover samples and standard flasks with aluminum foil to be sure that the foil does not<br>
come off in the autoclave.<br>
Place a Comply SteriGage Steam Chemical Integrator on the rack in the autoclave. Autoclave<br>
for 60 minutes at a pressure of 14-16 psi (95-105 kPa) and temperature &gt;260°F (127°C).<br>
Remove the samples from the autoclave. Cool the samples. Transfer samples to the 200-mL<br>
volumetric flasks. Add 2-deoxy-D-glucose to wood samples. Bring the flask to final volume<br>
with water.<br>
For Kraft and Dissolving pulp samples:<br>
Filter an aliquot of the sample through GHP 0.45 μ filter into a 16-mL amber vial.<br>
For Wood pulp samples:<br>
Allow particulates to settle. Draw off approximately 10 mL of sample from the top, trying not<br>
to disturb particles and filter the aliquot of the sample through GHP 0.45 μ filter into a 16-mL<br>
amber vial. Transfer the label from the volumetric flask to the vial. Add 1.00 mL aliquot of<br>
the filtered sample with to 8.0 mL of water in the Dionex vial.<br>
Samples are run on the Dionex AS/500 system. See Chromatography procedure below.<br>
CHROMATOGRAPHY PROCEDURE<br>
Solvent preparation<br>
Solvent A is distilled and deionized water (18 meg-ohm), sparged with helium while stirring<br>
for a minimum of 20 minutes, before installing under a blanket of helium, which is to be<br>
maintained regardless of whether the system is on or off.<br>
Solvent B is 400 mM NaOH. Fill Solvent B bottle to mark with water and sparge with helium<br>
while stirring for 20 minutes. Add appropriate amount of 50% NaOH.<br>
(50.0g NaOH/100 g solution) * (1 mol NaOH/40.0g NaOH) * (1.53g solution/1 mL solution)<br>
* (1000 mL solution/1 L solution) = 19.1 M NaOH in the container of 50/50 w/w NaOH.<br>
0.400 M NaOH * (1000mL H2O /19.1 M NaOH) = 20.8 mL NaOH<br>
Round 20.8 mL down for convenience:<br>
19.1 M * (20.0 mL x mL) = 0.400 M NaOH<br>
x mL = 956 mL<br>
Solvent D is 200 mM sodium acetate. Using 18 meg-ohm water, add approximately 450 mL<br>
deionized water to the Dionex sodium acetate container. Replace the top and shake until the<br>
contents are completely dissolved. Transfer the sodium acetate solution to a 1-L volumetric<br>
flask. Rinse the 500-mL sodium acetate container with approximately 100 mL water,<br>
transferring the rinse water into the volumetric flask. Repeat rinse twice. After the rinse, fill<br>
the contents of the volumetric flask to the 1-L mark with water. Thoroughly mix the eluent<br>
solution. Measure 360 ±10 mL into a 2-L graduated cylinder. Bring to 1800 ±10 mL. Filter<br>
this into a 2000-mL sidearm flask using the Millipore filtration apparatus with a 0.45pm,<br>
Type HA membrane. Add this to the solvent D bottle and sparge with helium while stirring<br>
for 20 minutes.<br>
The post-column addition solvent is 300 mM NaOH. This is added post-column to enable the<br>
detection of sugars as anions at pH &gt;12.3. Transfer 15 ±0.5 mL of 50% NaOH to a graduated<br>
cylinder and bring to 960 ±10 mL in water.<br>
(500g NaOH/100g Solution) * (1 mol NaOH/40.0g NaOH) * (1.53g Solution/1 mL Solution)<br>
(1000 mL Solution/ 1 L solution) = 19.1 M NaOH in the container of 50/50 w/w NaOH.<br>
0.300 M NaOH * (1000ml H2O /19.1 M NaOH) = 15.7 mL NaOH<br>
Round 15.7 mL down:<br>
19.1M * (15.0 mL/x mL) = 0.300 M NaOH<br>
x mL = 956 mL<br>
(Round 956 mL to 960 mL. As the pH value in the area of 0.300 M NaOH is steady, an exact<br>
956 mL of water is not necessary.)<br>
Set up the AS 50 schedule.<br>
Injection volume is 5 uL for all samples, injection type is "Full", cut volume is 10 uL, syringe<br>
speed is 3, all samples and standards are of Sample Type "Sample". Weight and Int. Std.<br>
values are all set equal to 1.<br>
Run the five standards at the beginning of the run in the following order:<br>
STANDARD Al DATE<br>
STANDARD Bl DATE<br>
STANDARD Cl DATE<br>
STANDARD Dl DATE<br>
STANDARD El DATE<br>
After the last sample is run, run the mid-level standard again as a continuing calibration<br>
verification<br>
Run the control sample at any sample spot between the beginning and ending standard runs.<br>
Run the samples.<br>
CALCULATIONS<br>
Calculations for Weight Percent of the Pulp Sugars<br>
(Area sugar) * (μg/mL fucose)<br>
Normalized area for sugar =	<br>
(Area Fucose)<br>
((Normalized area for sugar) - (intercept))<br>
IS Corrected sugar amount (μg/mL =	<br>
(slope)<br>
IS - Corrected sugar amt (μg/mL)<br>
Monomer Sugar Weight % =	-—	-	 * 20<br>
Sample wt. (mg)<br>
Example for arabinose:<br>
0.15 μg/mL arabinose<br>
Monomer Sugar Weight % =	—	* 20 = 0.043%<br>
70.71 mg arabinose<br>
Polymer Weight % = (Weight % of Sample sugar) * (0.88)<br>
Example for arabinan:<br>
Polymer Sugar Weight % = (0.043 wt %) *(0.88) = 0.038 Weight<br>
Note: Xylose and arabinose amounts are corrected by 88% and fucose, galactose, rhamnose,<br>
glucose, and mannose are corrected by 90%.<br>
Report results as percent sugars on an oven-dried basis.<br>
