				<td>NOVEL INHIBITORS OF CHYMASE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to certain novel compounds, methods for preparing<br>
compounds, compositions, intermediates and derivatives thereof and methods for treating<br>
inflammatory and serine protease mediated disorders. More particularly, the compounds of<br>
the present invention are serine protease inhibitors useful for treating inflammatory and<br>
serine protease mediated disorders.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Serine proteases represent a broad class of proteolytic enzymes that are involved<br>
in physiological processes such as blood coagulation, complement activation, phagocytosis<br>
and turnover of damaged cell tissue. Human chymase (EC.3.4.21.39) is a glycosylated<br>
monomeric chymotrypsin-like serine protease (MW = 30 kDa) localized mainly in mast cell<br>
secretory granules. Chymase is thought to have a variety of functions, including<br>
degradation of extracellular matrix proteins, cleavage of angiotensin I to angiotensin II.<br>
(except in the rat), and activation of matrix proteases and cytokines. Endogenously,<br>
chymase is regulated by the serpins ccl-antichymotrypsin and a 1-proteinase.<br>
Although the precise patho-physiological roles of chymase have yet to be<br>
determined, chymase has been implicated in microvascular leakage, neutrophil<br>
accumulation, the stimulation of mucus secretion, and the modulation of cytokines. A<br>
potent, chymase-selective inhibitor may be indicated in mast cell-mediated diseases such<br>
as asthma, pulmonary inflammation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD).<br>
Because chymase can play a role in the generation of cardiac and vascular wall<br>
angiotensin II, an inhibitor may have potential use as an antihypertensive treatment for<br>
vascular wall injury and inflammation (atherosclerosis/restenosis), as well as cardiac<br>
hypertrophy. Thus, small molecule inhibitors of chymase are likely to represent useful<br>
therapeutic agents.<br>
US Patent 5,508,273 to Beers, et al. and Bioorganic &amp; Med. Chem. Lett, 1995, 5<br>
(16), 1801-1806 describe phosphonic acid compounds useful in treating bone wasting<br>
diseases. In particular, 1-napthylmethylphosphonic acid derivatives have been described<br>
as osteoclastic acid phosphatase inhibitors of the formula:<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide phosphonic acid and<br>
phosphinic acid compounds that are serine protease inhibitors, in particular, inhibitors of<br>
chymase, useful for treating inflammatory and serine protease mediated disorders. It is<br>
another object of the invention to provide a process for preparing phosphonic or phosphinic<br>
acid compounds, compositions, intermediates and derivatives thereof. It is a further object<br>
of the invention to provide methods for treating inflammatory and serine protease mediated<br>
disorders.<br>

The present invention includes within its scope prodrugs of the compounds of this<br>
invention. In general, such prodrugs will be functional derivatives of the compounds, which<br>
are readily convertible in vivo into an active compound. Thus, in the methods of treatment<br>
of the present invention, the term "administering" shall encompass the treatment of the<br>
various disorders described with the compound specifically disclosed or a prodrug<br>
compound which would be obviously included within the scope of the invention although<br>
not specifically disclosed. Conventional procedures for the selection and preparation of<br>
suitable prodrug derivatives are described, for example, in "Design of Prodrugs", ed. H.<br>

The compounds according to this invention may have at least one chiral center and<br>
thus may exist as enantiomers. In addition, the compounds of the present invention may<br>
also possess two or more chiral centers and thus may also exist as diastereomers. Where.<br>
the processes for the preparation of the present compounds give rise to a mixture of<br>
stereoisomers, these isomers may be separated by conventional technique's such as<br>
preparative chromatography. Accordingly, the compounds may be prepared as a racemic<br>
mixture or, by either enantiospecific synthesis or resolution, as individual enantiomers. The<br>
compounds may, for example, be resolved from a racemic mixture into their component<br>
racemates by standard techniques, such as the formation of diastereomeric pairs by salt<br>
formation with an optically active base, followed by fractional crystallization and<br>
regeneration of the compounds of this invention. The racemic mixture may also be<br>
resolved by formation of diastereomeric esters or amides, followed by chromatographic<br>
separation and removal of the chiral auxiliary. Alternatively, the compounds may be<br>
resolved using a chiral HPLC column. It is to be understood that all such isomers and<br>
mixtures thereof are encompassed within the scope of the present invention.<br>
During any of the processes for preparation of the compounds of the present<br>
invention, it may be necessary and/or desirable to protect sensitive or reactive.groups on<br>
any of the molecules concerned. This may be achieved by means of conventional<br>
protecting groups, such as those described in Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, ed.<br>
J.F.W. McOmie, Plenum Press, 1973; and T.W. Greene &amp; P.G.M. Wuts, Protective Groups<br>
in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1991. The protecting groups may be removed at<br>
a convenient subsequent stage using methods known in the art.<br>
Furthermore, some of the crystalline forms for the compounds may exist as<br>
polymorphs and as such are intended to be included in the present invention. In addition,<br>
some of the compounds may form solvates with water (i.e., hydrates) or common organic<br>
solvents, and such solvates are also intended to be encompassed within the scope of this<br>
invention.<br>
As used herein, unless otherwise noted, "alkyl" whether used alone or as part of a<br>
substituent group refers to straight and branched carbon chains having 1 to 8 carbon<br>
atoms or any number within this range. The term "alkoxy" refers to an -Oalkyl substituent<br>
group, wherein alkyl is as defined supra. Similarly, the terms "alkenyl" and "alkynyl" refer to<br>
straight and branched carbon chains having 2 to 8 carbon atoms or any number within this<br>
range, wherein an alkenyl chain has at least one double bond in the chain and an alkynyl<br>
chain has at least one triple bond in the chain. An alkyl and alkoxy chain may be<br>
substituted on a terminal carbon atom or, when acting as a linking group, within the carbon<br>
chain.<br>
The term "cycloalkyl" refers to saturated or partially unsaturated, moncyclic or<br>
polycyclic hydrocarbon rings of from 3 to 20 carbon atom members (preferably from 3 to 14<br>
carbon atom members). Further, a cycloalkyl ring may optionally be fused to one or more<br>
cycloalkyl rings. Examples of such rings include, and are not limited to, cyclopropyl,<br>
cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, and adamantyl.<br>
The term "heterocyclyl" refers to a nonaromatic cyclic ring of 5 to 10 members in which<br>
1 to 4 members are nitrogen or a nonaromatic cyclic ring of 5 to 10 members in which zero,<br>
one or two members are nitrogen and up to two members is oxygen or sulfur; wherein,<br>
optionally, the ring contains zero, one or two unsaturated bonds. Alternatively, the<br>
heterocyclyl ring may be fused to a benzene ring (benzo fused heterocyclyl), a 5 or 6<br>
membered heteroaryl ring (containing one of O, S or N and, optionally, one additional<br>
nitrogen), a 5 to 7 membered cycloalkyl or cycloalkenyl ring, a 5 to 7 membered heterocyclyl<br>
ring (of the same definition as above but absent the option of a further fused ring) or fused<br>
with the carbon of attachment of a cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl or neterocyclyl ring to form a spiro<br>
moiety. For instant compounds of the invention, the carbon atom ring members that form the<br>
heterocyclyl ring are fully saturated. Other compounds of the invention may have a partially<br>
saturated heterocyclyl ring. Additionally, the heterocyclyl can be bridged to form bicyclic rings.<br>
Preferred partially saturated heterocyclyl rings may have from one to two double bonds. Such<br>
compounds are not considered to be fully aromatic and are not referred to as heteroaryl<br>
compounds. Examples of heterocyclyl groups include, and are not limited to, pyrrolinyl<br>
(including 2H-pyrrole, 2-pyrroJinyl or 3-pyrrolinyl), pyrrolidinyl, 2-imidazolinyl, imidazolidinyl,<br>
2-pyrazolinyl, pyrazolidinyl, piperidinyl, morpholinyl, thiomorpholinyl, and piperazinyl.<br>
The term "aryl" refers to an unsaturated, aromatic monocyclic ring of 6 carbon<br>
members or to an unsaturated, aromatic polycyclic ring of from 10 to 20 carbon members.<br>
Examples of such aryl rings include, and are not limited to, phenyl, naphthalenyl and<br>
anthracenyl. Preferred aryl groups for the practice of this invention are phenyl and<br>
naphthalenyl.<br>
The term "benzo fused cycloalkyl" refers to a bicyclic or tricyclic ring structure wherein<br>
at least one of the ring substituents is phenyl or naphthalenyl and at least one of the other<br>
substituents is a cycloalkyl ring (as cycloalkyl was previously defined). For the purpose of<br>
these definitions, the cycloalkyl rings may be fused to an additional benzene ring (to provide<br>
fused multiple ring systems such as fluorene). Example of such benzo fused cycloalkyls<br>
include, but are not limited to, indanyl, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalenyl and fluorenyl.<br>
The term "heteroaryl" refers to an aromatic ring of 5 or 6 members wherein the ring<br>
consists of carbon atoms and has at least one heteroatom member. Suitable heteroatoms<br>
include nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur. In the case of 5 membered rings, the heteroaryl ring<br>
contains one member of nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur and, in addition, may contain up to three<br>
additional nitrogens. In the case of 6 membered rings, the heteroaryl ring may contain<br>
from one to three nitrogen atoms. For the case wherein the 6 membered ring has three<br>
nitrogens, at most two nitrogen atoms are adjacent. Optionally, the heteroaryl ring is fused to<br>
a benzene ring (benzo fused heteroaryl), a 5 or 6 membered heteroaryl ring (containing, one of<br>
O, S or N and, optionally, one additional nitrogen), a 5 to 7 membered cycloalkyl ring or a 5 to<br>
7 membered heterocyclo ring (as defined supra but absent the option of a further fused ring).<br>
Examples of heteroaryl groups include, and are not limited to, furyl, thienyl, pyrrolyl, oxazolyl,<br>
thiazolyl, imidazolyl, pyrazolyl, isoxazolyl, isothiazolyl, oxadiazolyl, triazolyl, thiadiazolyl,<br>
pyridinyl, pyridazinyl, pyrimidinyl or pyrazinyl; fused heteroaryl groups include indolyl,<br>
isoindolyl, indolinyl, benzofuryl, benzothienyl, indazolyl, benzimidazolyl, benzthiazolyl,<br>
benzoxazolyl, benzisoxazolyl, benzothiadiazolyl, benzotriazolyl, quinolizinyl, quinolinyl,<br>
isoquinolinyl,a nd quinazolinyl.<br>
The term "arylalkyl" means an alkyl group substituted with an aryl group (e.g., benzyl<br>
and phenethyl). Similarly, the term "arylalkoxy" indicates an alkoxy group substituted with an<br>
aryl group (e.g., benzyloxy).<br>
The term "halogen" refers to fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine. Substituents that<br>
are substituted with multiple halogens are substituted in a manner that provides compounds<br>
which are stable.<br>
Whenever the term "alkyl" or "aryl" or either of their prefix roots appear in a name of a<br>
substituent (e.g., arylalkyl and alkylamino), it shall be interpreted as including those limitations<br>
given above for "alkyl" and "aryl." Designated numbers of carbon atoms (e.g., Ci-C6) shall<br>
refer independently to the number of carbon atoms in an alkyl moiety or to the alkyl portion of<br>
a larger substituent in which alkyl appears as its prefix root. For alkyl, and alkoxy substituents<br>
the designated number of carbon atoms includes all of the independent member included in<br>
the range specified individually and all the combination of ranges within in the range specified.<br>
For example C^ alkyl would include methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl and hexyl individually<br>
as well as sub-combinations thereof (e.g., C^.2, C^3, Cm, Ci-5,C2.6, C3.6, C^, C5^, C2.5,etc.).<br>
However, for clarity in the terms "C9-C14 benzo fused cycloalkyl", "C9-C14 benzo fused<br>
cycloalkenyl", "C9-Cu benzo fused aryl"; Cg-Cu refers to the number of carbon atoms both in<br>
the benzene ring (6) and the number of atoms in the ring fused to the benzene ring, but does<br>
not include carbon atoms that may be pendent from these multiple ring systems. The amount<br>
of substituents attached to a moiety "optionally substituted with one to five substituents" is<br>
limited to that amount of open valences on the moiety available for substitution.<br>
In general, under standard nomenclature rules used throughout this disclosure, the<br>
terminal portion of the designated side chain is described first followed by the adjacent<br>
functionality toward the point of attachment. Thus, for example, a "phenylCrC6 alkylamidoCr<br>
C6alkyl" substituent refers to a group of the formula:<br><br>
It is intended that the definition of any substituent or variable at a particular location<br>
in a molecule be independent of its definitions elsewhere in that molecule. It is understood<br>
that substituents and substitution patterns on the compounds of this invention can be<br>
selected by one of ordinary skill in the art to provide compounds that are chemically stable '<br>
and that can be readily synthesized by techniques known in the art as well as those<br>
methods set forth herein.<br>
Illustrative of the invention is a composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carrier and any of the compounds described above. Also illustrative of the invention is a<br>
composition made by mixing any of the compounds described above and a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier. A further illustration of the invention is a process for making a composition<br>
comprising mixing any of the compounds described above anfcl a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carrier. The present invention also provides compositions comprising one or more<br>
compounds of this invention in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are useful serine protease inhibitors (in<br>
particular, inhibitors of chymase) useful for treating inflammatory, and serine protease<br>
mediated disorders. Serine proteases such as chymase produced by mast cells have been<br>
recognized to be involved in a variety of inflammatory and wound healing events (e.g.,<br>
angiogenesis, collagen deposition and cell proliferation). Chymase plays these roles by<br>
activating a variety of pre-existing factors present in the microenvironment surrounding the<br>
mast cells. For examplejust to name a few of these interactions chymase activates SCF,<br>
angiotensin I to angiotensin II, endothelin 1, type 1 procollagen, metalloprotienases, IL-1B,<br>
TGF-p, as well as, degrades the extracellular matrix (de Paulis etal. Int Arch Allerg<br>
Immunol 118 (1999) 422-425; Longley etal. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 94 (1997) 9017-<br>
9021). Consequently, the release of chymase plays significant role in a variety of<br>
pathological conditions associated with vascular proliferation, fibrosis, tissue remodeling,<br>
inflammation, and the like.<br>
Some of these, inflammatory and serine protease mediated disorders include, and are<br>
not limited to, allergic rhinitis, viral rhinitis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases,<br>
bronchitis, pulmonary emphysema, acute lung injury (e.g. adult (acute) respiratory distress<br>
syndrome) psoriasis, arthritis, reperfusion injury, ischemia, hypertension, hypercardia<br>
myocardial infarction, heart failure damage associated with myocardial infarction, cardiac<br>
hypertrophy, arteriosclerosis, saroidosis, vascular stenosis or restenosis (e.g., associated with<br>
vascular injury, angioplasty, vascular stents or vascular grafts), pulmonary fibrosis, kidney<br>
fibrosis (e.g., associated with glomerulonephritis), liver fibrosis, post surgical adhesion<br>
formation, systemic sclerosis, keloid scars rheumatoid arthritis, bullous pemphigiod and<br>
atherosclerosis. Additionally, these compounds can be used for modulating wound healing<br>
and remodeling (e.g., cardiac hypertrophy) as well as immune modulation. The utility of the<br>
compounds to treat inflammatory and serine protease mediated disorders is illustrated by the .<br>
following non-limiting discussions of the proposed mechanisms of actions of chymase. Other<br>
disorders that can be treated with chymase inhibitors can be determined according to the<br>
procedures described herein and the use of animal knock-out models and the like.<br>
As mentioned above, chymase coverts angiotensin I into angiotensin II, and this<br>
activity has been associated with vascular proliferation. In human vascular extracts only<br>
about 8% of angiotensin II activity is inhibited with an angiotensin converting enzyme<br>
inhibitor (lisinopril) while 95% is inhibited by a chymase inhibitor. In vein grafts, vascular<br>
injury associated with catheter or balloon injury, chymase induces vascular hyperplasia and<br>
restenosis in dogs (Takai and Miyazaki, 21 (2003) 185-189). This same mechanism of<br>
action would also be expected to apply to restenosis associated with the use of vascular<br>
stents. Pathological serine protease mediated disorders associated with angiotensin II,<br>
including but not limited to hypertension, hypercardia myocardial infarction, arteriosclerosis,<br>
saroidosis, vascular stenosis or restenosis (e.g., associated with vascular injury,<br>
angioplasty, vascular stents or vascular grafts), and the like.<br>
Pathological fibrosis can be associated with the degeneration of organs (e.g., skin,<br>
heart, kidneys or liver) or as an undesirable outcome of surgery. Preventing the formation<br>
of pathological fibrosis would be beneficial in a variety of diseases. For example mast cell<br>
chymase has been implicated in pulmonary fibrosis, kidney fibrosis, liver fibrosis, post<br>
surgical adhesion formation, systemic sclerosis, keloid scars, and the like.<br>
In the heart mast cells have been implicated in cardiac hypertrophy, which involves<br>
both fibrosis and remodeling. Cardiac hypertrophy develops to preserve its function by<br>
normalizing chamber wall stress. Mast cells have been implicated as being involved in the<br>
development of myocardial fibrosis and systolic pressure over load induced hypertrophy<br>
(Hara era/., J. Exp. Med. 195 (2002) 375-381). The remodeling of the heart associated<br>
under these conditions is believed to involve mast cell chymase, which activates endothelin<br>
1, matrix metalloproteinases and TGF-(3. Chymase inhibitors have been shown to exert<br>
favorable cardioprotective action in a dog model of hypertrophy (Matsumoto etal.,<br>
Circulation 107 (2003) 2555-2558). '<br>
In the kidneys mast cell chymase has also been implicated in pathological firbrosis.<br>
For example, glomerulonephritis has also been reported to involve mast cells (Ehara and<br>
Shigematsu, Kidney Inter. 54 (1998) 1675-1683). The results of this found that mast cells<br>
were one of the constitutive cell types in the interstitium of IgA nephritis patients and<br>
contributed to interstitial fibrosis resulting in deterioration of renal function. Similarly, liver<br>
fibrosis has been associated with mast cells (Yamashiro etal., Virchows Arch. 433 (1998)<br>
471-479). Although, the mechanisms for fibrosis in the kidney and liver have not been as<br>
well defined as for coronary fibrosis, it is very likely that chymase is operating through<br>
similar signaling pathways to cause fibrosis (especially in liver fibrosis where fibrosis seem<br>
to be occurring more frequently where mast cells stained positive for chymase).<br>
Chymase is also involved in the formation of fibrous adhesions associated with<br>
surgery. Chymase inhibitors have been tested in two different animals models and found<br>
to reduce the number of adhesions (Okamoto etal., J. Surg. Res. 107 (2002) 219-222 and<br>
Lucas et al., J. Surg. Res. 65 (1999) 135). It has been suggested that the prevention of<br>
adhesions is associated with blocking the activation of latent TGF-B by chymase (Yoa.ef<br>
al., J. Surg. Res. 92 (2000) 40-44). " ••<br>
Collagen induced arthritic mice show increased numbers of mast cells and<br>
expression of chymase in fibroproliferative inflammation (Kakizoe etal., Inflamm. Res. 48<br>
(1999) 318-324). In human rheumatoid arthritis increased mast cell density in the<br>
superficial synovium is associated with the severity of the disease (Grotis-Graham and<br>
McNeil, Arthritis &amp; Rheumatism 40 (1997) 479-489). It was theorized by these authors that<br>
chymase and its ability to activate metalloprotinases plays a significant role in the rapid<br>
functional deterioration observed in rheumatoid arthritis.<br>
Mast ceil chymase has been implicated in artherosclerosis via its ability to cleave<br>
apolipoprotein B-100 of LDL which facilitates lipoprotein aggregation and uptake by<br>
macrophages (Paananen et al., J. Biol. Chem. 269 (1994) 2023-2031). Chymase also<br>
degrades apolipoprotein A of HDL, which would reduce cholesterol efflux and increases<br>
lipid deposition (Lindstedt etal., J. Clin. Invest. 97 (1996) 2174-2182). Thus chymase is<br>
involved in two different pathways to atherosclerosis.<br>
An embodiment of the invention is a method for treating inflammatory and serine<br>
protease mediated disorders in a subject in need thereof which comprises administering to<br>
the subject a therapeutically effective amount of any of the compounds or compositions<br>
described above. Also included in the invention is the use of a compound of Formula (I) for<br>
the preparation of a medicament for treating an inflammatory or serine protease mediated<br>
disorder in a subject in need thereof. The term "treating" as used herein refers to a method<br>
for improving, halting, retarding or palliating an inflammatory or serine protease mediated<br>
disorder in the subject in need thereof. All such methods of treatment are intended to be<br>
within the scope of the present invention.<br>
In accordance with the methods of the present invention, the individual components<br>
of the compositions described herein can also be administered separately at different times<br>
during the course of therapy or concurrently in divided or single combination forms. The<br>
instant invention is therefore to be understood as embracing all such regimes of<br>
simultaneous or alternating treatment and the term "administering" is to be interpreted<br>
accordingly.<br>
The term "subject" as used herein, refers to an animal (preferably, a mammal; most<br>
preferably, a human) who has been the object of treatment, observation, or experiment.<br>
The term "therapeutically effective amount" as used herein, means that amount of<br>
active compound or pharmaceutical agent that elicits the biological or medicinal response in a<br>
tissue system, animal or human, that is being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical<br>
doctor, or other clinician, which includes alleviation of the symptoms of the disease or disorder<br>
being treated.<br>
As used herein, the term "composition" is intended to encompass a product<br>
comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well as any product which<br>
results, directly or indirectly, from combinations of the specified ingredients in the specified<br>
amounts.<br>
To prepare the compositions of this invention, one or more compounds of Formula<br>
(I) or salt thereof as the active ingredient, is intimately admixed with a pharmaceutical<br>
carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques, which carrier<br>
may take a wide variety of forms depending of the form of preparation desired for<br>
administration (e.g. oral or parenteral). Suitable pharmaceutical^ acceptable carriers are<br>
well known in the art. Descriptions of some of these pharmaceutical^ acceptable carriers<br>
may be found in The Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients. published by the American<br>
Pharmaceutical Association and the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain.<br>
Methods of formulating compositions have been described in numerous<br>
publications such as Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Tablets, Second Edition. Revised and<br>
Expanded. Volumes 1 -3, edited by Lieberman et al; Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms:<br>
Parenteral Medications, Volumes 1-2, edited by Avis et al; and Pharmaceutical Dosage<br>
Forms: Disperse Systems. Volumes 1-2, edited by Lieberman et al; published by Marcel<br>
Dekker, Inc.<br>
In preparing a composition of the present invention in liquid dosage form for oral,<br>
topical, inhalation/insufflation and parenteral administration, any of the usual<br>
pharmaceutical media or excipients may be employed. Thus, for liquid dosage forms, such<br>
as suspensions-(i.e., colloids, emulsions and dispersions) and solutions, suitable carriers<br>
and additives include but are not limited to pharmaceutical^ acceptable wetting agents,<br>
dispersants, flocculation agents, thickeners, pH control agents (i.e., buffers), osmotic<br>
agents, coloring agents, flavors, fragrances, preservatives (i.e., to control microbial growth,<br>
etc.) and a liquid vehicle may be employed. Not all of the components listed above will be<br>
required for each liquid dosage form.<br>
In solid oral preparations such as, for example, powders, granules, capsules,<br>
caplets, gelcaps, pills and tablets (each including immediate release, timed release<br>
and sustained release formulations), suitable carriers and additives include but are<br>
not limited to diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, glidants,<br>
disintegrating agents, and the like. Because of their ease of administration, tablets<br>
and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which<br>
case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. If desired, tablets may<br>
be sugar coated, gelatin coated, film coated or enteric coated by standard<br>
techniques.<br>
Preferably these compositions are in unit dosage forms from such as tablets,<br>
pills, capsules, powders, granules, lozenges, sterile parenteral solutions or<br>
suspensions, metered aerosol or liquid sprays, drops, ampoules, autoinjector<br>
devices or suppositories for administration by oral, intranasal, sublingual,<br>
intraocular, transdermal, parenteral, rectal, vaginal* inhalation or insufflation means.<br>
Alternatively, the composition may be presented in a form suitable for once-weekly<br>
or once-monthly administration; for example, an insoluble salt of the active<br>
compound, such as the decanoate salt, may be adapted to provide a depot<br>
preparation for intramuscular injection.<br>
For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the principal active ingredient is<br>
mixed with, a pharmaceutical carrier, e.g., conventional tabletting ingredients such as<br>
diluents, binders, adhesives, disintegrants, lubricants, antiadherents, and glidants.<br>
Suitable diluents include, but are not limited to, starch (i.e., corn, wheat, or potato starch,<br>
which may be hydrolized), lactose (granulated, spray dried or anhydrous), sucrose,<br>
sucrose-based diluents (confectioner's sugar; sucrose plus about 7 to 10 weight percent<br>
invert sugar; sucrose plus about 3 weight percent modified dextrins; sucrose plus invert<br>
sugar, about 4 weight percent invert sugar, about 0.1 to 0.2 weight percent cornstarch and<br>
magnesium stearate), dextrose, inositol, mannitol, sorbitol, microcrystalline cellulose (i.e.,<br>
AVICEL ™ microcrystalline cellulose available from FMC Corp.), dicalcium phosphate,<br>
calcium sulfate dihydrate, calcium lactate trihydrate, and the like. Suitable binders and<br>
adhesives include, but are not limited to accacia gum, guar gum, tragacanth gum, sucrose,<br>
gelatin, glucose, starch, and cellulosics (i.e. methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethy-<br>
cellulose, ethylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, and the<br>
like), water soluble or dispersible binders (i.e., alginic acid and salts thereof, magnesium<br>
aluminum silicate, hydroxyethylcellulose (i.e. TYLOSE ™ available from Hoechst<br>
Celanese), polyethylene glycol, polysaccharide acids, bentonites, polyvinylpyrrolidone,<br>
polymethacrylates and pregelatinized starch), and the like. Suitable disintegrants include,<br>
but are not limited to, starches (corn, potato, etc.), sodium starch glycolates, pregelatinized<br>
starches, clays (magnesium aluminum silicate), celluloses (such as crosslinked sodium<br>
carboxymethylcellulose and microcrystalline cellulose), alginates, pregelatinized starches<br>
(i.e., corn starch, etc.), gums (i.e., agar, guar, locust bean, karaya, pectin, and tragacanth<br>
gum), cross-linked polyvinylpyrrolidone, and the like. Suitable lubricants and antiadherents<br>
include, but are not limited to, stearates (magnesium, calcium and sodium), stearic acid,<br>
talc waxes, stearowet, boric acid, sodium chloride, DL-leucine, carbowax 4000, carbowax<br>
6000, sodium oleate, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium lauryl sulfate, magnesium<br>
lauryl sulfate, and the like. Suitable gildants include, but are not limited to, talc, cornstarch,<br>
silica (i.e., CAB-O-SIL ™ silica available from Cabot, SYLOID ™ silica available from W.R.<br>
Grace/Davison, and AEROSIL ™ silica available from Degussa), and the like. Sweeteners<br>
and flavorants may be added to chewable solid dosage forms to improve the palatability of<br>
the oral dosage form. Additionally, colorants and coatings may be added or applied to the<br>
solid dosage form for ease of identification of the drug or for aesthetic purposes. These<br>
carriers are formulated with the pharmaceutical active to provide an accurate, appropriate<br>
dose of the pharmaceutical active with a therapeutic release profile.<br>
Generally these carriers are mixed with the pharmaceutical active to form a solid<br>
preformulation composition containing a homogeneous mixture of the pharmaceutical<br>
active of the present invention, or a pharmaceutical^ acceptable salt thereof. Generally<br>
the preformulation will be formed by one of three common methods: (a) wet granulation, (b)<br>
dry granulation, and (c) dry blending. When referring to these preformulation compositions<br>
as homogeneous, it is meant that the active ingredient is dispersed evenly throughout the<br>
composition so that the composition may be readily subdivided into equally effective<br>
dosage forms such as tablets, pills and capsules. This solid preformufation composition is<br>
then subdivided into unit dosage forms of the type described above containing from about<br>
0.01 mg to about 500 mg of the active ingredient of the present invention. The tablets or<br>
pills containing the novel compositions may also be formulated in multilayer tablets or pills<br>
to provide a sustained or provide dual-release products. For example, a dual release tablet<br>
or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component, the latter being in<br>
the form of an envelope over the former. The two components can be separated by an<br>
enteric layer, which serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permits the inner<br>
component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of<br>
materials can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials including a<br>
number of polymeric materials such as shellac, cellulose acetate, cellulose acetate<br>
phthalate, polyvinyl acetate phthalate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate, hydroxy-<br>
propyl methylcellulose acetate succinate, methacrylate and ethylacrylate copolymers, and<br>
the like. Sustained release tablets may also be made by film coating or wet granulation<br>
using slightly soluble or insoluble substances in solution (which for a wet granulation acts<br>
as the binding agents) or low melting solids a molten form (which in a wet granulation may<br>
incorporate the active ingredient). These materials include natural and synthetic polymers<br>
waxes, hydrogenated oils, fatty acids and alcohols (i.e., beeswax, carnauba wax, cetyl<br>
alcohol, cetylstearyl alcohol, and the like), esters of fatty acids metallic soaps, and other<br>
acceptable materials that can be used to granulate, coat, entrap or otherwise limit the<br>
solubility of an active ingredient to achieve a prolonged or sustained release product.<br>
The liquid forms in which the novel compositions of the present invention may be<br>
incorporated for administration orally or by injection include, but are not limited to aqueous<br>
solutions, suitably flavored syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions, and flavored emulsions<br>
with edible oils such as cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut oil or peanut oil, as well as<br>
elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles. Suitable suspending agents for aqueous<br>
suspensions, include synthetic and natural gums such as, acacia, agar, alginate (i.e.,<br>
propylene alginate, sodium alginate, and the like), guar, karaya, locust bean, pectin,<br>
tragacanth, and xanthan gum, cellulosics such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose,<br>
methylcellulose, hydroxymethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose<br>
and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, and combinations thereof, synthetic polymers such as<br>
polyvinyl, pyrrolidone, carbomer (i.e., carboxypolymethylene), and polyethylene glycol;<br>
clays such as bentonite, hectorite, attapulgite or sepiolite; and other pharmaceutical^<br>
acceptable suspending agents such as lecithin, gelatin, or the like. Suitable surfactants<br>
include but are not limited to sodium docusate, sodium lauryl sulfate, polysorbate,<br>
octoxynol-9, nonoxynol-10, polysorbate 20, polysorbate 40, polysorbate 60, polysorbate<br>
80, polyoxamer 188, polyoxamer 235, and combinations thereof. Suitable deflocculating or<br>
dispersing agent include pharmaceutical grade lecithins. Suitable flocculating agent<br>
include but are not limited to simple neutral electrolytes (i.e., sodium chloride, potassium,<br>
chloride, and the like), highly charged insoluble polymers and polyelectrolyte species,<br>
water soluble divalent or trivalent ions (i.e., calcium salts, alums or sulfates, citrates and<br>
phosphates (which can be used jointly in formulations as pH buffers and flocculating<br>
n-propyl and n-butyl), sorbic acid, thimerosal, quaternary ammonium salts, benzyl alcohol,<br>
benzoic acid, chlorhexidine gluconate, phenylethanol, and the like. There are many liquid<br>
vehicles that may be used in liquid pharmaceutical dosage forms, however, the liquid<br>
vehicle that is used in a particular dosage form must be compatible with the suspending<br>
agent(s). For example, nonpolar liquid vehicles such as fatty esters and oils liquid vehicles<br>
are best used with suspending agents such as low HLB (Hydrophile-Lipophile Balance)<br>
surfactants, stearalkonium hectorite, water insoluble resins, water insoluble film forming<br>
polymers, and the like. Conversely, polar liquids such as water, alcohols, polyols and<br>
glycols are best.used with suspending agents such as higher HLB surfactants, clays<br>
silicates, gums, water soluble cellulosics, water soluble polymers, and the like. For<br>
parenteral administration, sterile suspensions and solutions are desired. Liquid forms useful<br>
for parenteral administration include sterile solutions, emulsions and suspensions. Isotonic<br>
preparations which generally contain suitable preservatives are employed when intravenous<br>
administration is desired.<br>
Furthermore, compounds of the present invention can be administered in an intranasal<br>
dosage form via topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles or via transdermal skin patches, the<br>
composition of which are well known to those of ordinary skill in that art. To be administered<br>
in the form of a transdermal delivery system, the administration of a therapeutic dose will, of<br>
course, be continuous rather than intermittent throughout the dosage regimen. .<br>
Compounds of the present invention can also be administered in a form suitable for<br>
intranasal or inhalation therapy. For such therapy, compounds of the present invention are<br>
conveniently delivered in the form of a solution or suspension from a pump spray container<br>
that is squeezed or pumped or as an aerosol spray from a pressurized container or a<br>
nebulizer (such as, a metered dose inhaler, a dry powder inhaler or other conventional or<br>
non-conventional modes or devices for inhalation delivery) using a suitable propellant<br>
(such as, dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane,<br>
carbon dioxide or other suitable gas). In the case of a pressurized aerosol, the dosage unit<br>
may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. The pressurized<br>
container or nebulizer may contain a solution or suspension of the active compound.<br>
Capsules and cartridges (such as, those made from gelatin) for use in an inhaler or<br>
insufflator may be formulated containing a powder mix of a compound of the invention and<br>
a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.<br>
Compounds of the present invention can also be administered in the form of liposome<br>
delivery systems, such as small unilamellar vesicles, large unilamellar vesicles, multilamellar<br>
vesicles and the like. Liposomes can be formed from a variety of phospholipids, such as<br>
cholesterol, stearylamine, phosphatidylcholines, and the like.<br>
Compounds of the present invention may also be delivered by the use of monoclonal<br>
antibodies as individual carriers to which the compound molecules are coupled. The<br>
compounds of the present invention may also be coupled with soluble polymers as targetable<br>
drug carriers. Such polymers can include, but are not limited to polyvinylpyrrolidone, pyran<br>
copolymer, polyhydroxypropylmeth'acrylamidephenol, polyhydroxy-ethylaspartamidephenol,<br>
and polyethyl eneoxidepolylysine substituted with palmitoyl residue^ Furthermore, the<br>
compounds of the present invention may be coupled to a class of biodegradable polymers<br>
useful in achieving controlled release of a drug, for example, to homopolymers and<br>
copolymers (which means polymers containing two or more chemically distinguishable<br>
repeating units) of lactide (which includes lactic acid d-, I- and meso lactide), glycolide<br>
(including glycolic acid), e-caprolactone, p-dioxanone (1,4-dioxan-2-one), trimethylene<br>
carbonate (1,3-dioxan-2-one), alkyl derivatives of trimethylene carbonate, 8-valerolactone,<br>
p-butyrolactone, y-butyrolactone, e-decalactone, hydroxybutyrate, hydroxyvalerate, 1,4-<br>
dioxepan-2-one (including its dimer 1,5,8,12-tetraoxacyclotetradecane-7,14-dione), 1,5-<br>
dioxepan-2-one, 6,6-dimethyl-1,4-dioxan-2-one, polyorthoesters, polyacetals,.<br>
polydihydropyrans, polycyanoacrylat.es, and cross-linked or amphipathic block copolymers of<br>
hydrogels and blends thereof.<br>
The therapeutically effective amount of a compound or composition thereof may be<br>
from about 0.001 mg/kg/dose to about 300 mg/kg/dose. Preferably, the therapeutically<br>
effective amount may be from about 0.001 mg/kg/dose to about 100 mg/kg/close. More<br>
preferably, the therapeutically effective amount may be from about 0.001 mg/kg/dose to<br>
about 50 mg/kg/dose. Most preferably, the therapeutically effective amount may be from<br>
about 0.001 mg/kg/dose to about 30 mg/kg/dose. Therefore, the therapeutically effective<br>
amount of the active ingredient contained per dosage unit (e.g., tablet, capsule, powder,<br>
injection, suppository, teaspoonful, and the like) as described herein will be in the range of<br>
from about 1 mg/day to about 21,000 mg/day for a subject, for example, having an average<br>
weight of 70 kg. For oral administration, the compositions are preferably provided in the form<br>
of tablets containing, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0,15.0, 25.0, 50.0, 100,150, 200,<br>
250 and 500 milligrams of the active ingredient for the symptomatic adjustment of the dosage<br>
to the subject to be treated.<br>
Optimal dosages to be administered may be readily determined by those skilled in<br>
the art, and will vary with the particular compound used, the mode of administration, the<br>
strength of the preparation, and the advancement of the disease condition. In addition,<br>
factors associated with the particular subject being treated, including subject age, weight,<br>
diet and time of administration, will result in the need to adjust the dose to an appropriate<br>
therapeutic level. Advantageously, compounds of the present invention may be<br>
administered in a single daily dose or the total daily dosage may be administered in divided<br>
doses of two, three or four times daily.<br>

GENERAL SYNTHETIC METHODS<br>
Representative compounds of the present invention can be synthesized in<br>
accordance with the general synthetic methods described below and are illustrated more<br>
particularly in the schemes that follow. Since the schemes are an illustration, the invention<br>
should not be construed as being limited by the chemical reactions and conditions<br>
expressed. The preparation of the various starting materials used in the schemes is well<br>
within the skill of persons versed in the art.<br>
The following schemes describe general synthetic methods whereby intermediate<br>
and target compounds of the present invention may be prepared. Additional representative<br>
compounds and stereoisomers, racemic mixtures, diasteromers and enantiomers thereof<br>
can be synthesized using the intermediates prepared in accordance to the general<br>
schemes and other materials, compounds and reagents known to those skilled in the art.<br>
All such compounds, stereoisomers, racemic mixtures, diasteromers and enantiomers<br>
thereof are intended to be encompassed within the scope of the present invention. Since<br>
the scheme is an illustration, the invention should not be construed as being limited by the<br>
chemical reactions and conditions expressed. The preparation of the various starting<br>
materials used in the scheme is well within the skill of persons versed in the art.<br>
Scheme A illustrates the general method for the preparation of compounds of the<br>
present invention by the reaction of a phosphonate or phosphinate anion (prepared from its<br>
corresponding phosphonate or phosphinate Compound A2 and an organometallic base<br>
such as n-butyllithium) to isocyanate A1 in a solvent such as THF to afford an<br>
amidophosphonate or amidophosphinate compound A3. One versed in the art will<br>
recognize that conventional chemical transformations may be utilized to prepare certain R2<br>
and R3 substituents of the present invention. For example, for the preparation of a<br>
compound wherein R3 is amino, a nitro group may be reduced with hydrazine hydrate in the<br>
presence of a palladium catalyst; or, for the preparation of a compound wherein R3is<br>
ureido, a compound in which R3 is an amino group may be reacted with a cyanate salt or<br>
the like.<br>
Compound A2, wherein R5 and R6 are as previously defined, may be made<br>
according to known methods (Katritsky et. al. Org. Prep. Proced. Int., 1990, 22(2), 209-213;<br>
J. Am. Chem. Soc, 2002, 124, 9386-9387; and Chem. Ber., 1963, 96, 3184-3194).<br>
Fluorinated R6 compounds can be made following methods known in the art such as the<br>
methods similar those set forth in Garabadzhia et al., Journal General Chemistry USSR,<br>
English translation, 1981, pages 1905-1910. Compound A3 may be dealkylated with<br>
bromotrimethyisilane in a solvent such as pyridine, followed by treatment with dilute HCI to<br>
afford Compound A4.<br>
Scheme A<br><br>
Compound A2, wherein Z is a heteroaryl or aryl ring, may be prepared from a<br>
commercially available or known haloalkyl substituted heteroaryl ring. Another method for<br>
preparing Compound A2 uses a quaternary ammonium salt rather than an alky! halide:<br>
Scheme B shows a method for preparing Compound A2 wherein R6 is an alkyl or<br>
alkehyl substituent using methods described in the literature (J. Organomei. Chem. 2002,<br>
643-644,154-163; J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 2002, 124, 9386-9387). An alternate method for<br>
preparing such compounds is described in the literature (Med. Chem. 1995, 3S(17), 3297-<br>
3312; Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1999, 7,2697-2704).<br>

Formula (I) is equal to 1. Reaction of an a/p-unsaturated carboxylic acid, Compound C3,<br>
with phosphorazidic acid dialkyl ester Compound C4 provides Compound C5. Compound<br>
C5 may subsequently undergo a Curtius rearrangement to afford an isocyanate<br>
intermediate, Compound C6. Compound C6 may be treated with a phosphonate or<br>
phosphinate anion (as previously described in Scheme A) in an aprotic solvent such as<br>
THF to yield amidophosphonate or amidophosphinate Compound C7. Compound C7 may<br>
be dealkylated with bromotrimethylsilane, followed by treatment with dilute HCI to afford<br>
Compound C8.<br>
Scheme D<br>
Scheme D further illustrates the preparation of compounds of the present invention<br>
wherein Y of Formula (I) is a heteroaryl substituent. Compound D1 may be dissolved in an<br>
aprotic solvent, treated with an organometallic base such as n-BuLi, and subsequently<br>
reacted with isocyanate Compound A1 to afford Compound D2. Compound' D2 may<br>
undergo a cycloaddition reaction with sodium azide to provide Compound D3.<br>
Scheme E<br><br>
Scheme E shows the preparation of compounds of the present invention wherein Y<br>
of Formula (I) is a sulfonic acid. Compound B2 may be treated with sodium sulfite to afford<br>
i - •<br>
Compound E2. Compound E2 may then be treated with an organometallic base such as<br>
isopropylmagnesium bromide and reacted with isocyanate Compound A1 to yield<br>
Compound E3.<br>
Scheme F <br>
Scheme F illustrates the preparation of compounds of the present invention wherein<br>
Y of Formula (I) is a carboxylic acid. Compound F1 may be reacted with isobutylene under<br>
acidic conditions to provide ester Compound F3. Compound F3 may then be treated with a<br>

Enzyme-Catalyzed Hydrolysis Assays<br>
Enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis rates were measured spectro-photometrically using<br>
human skin chymase (Cortex Biochem), a chromogenic substrate (Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-<br>
pNa) (Bachem) in aqueous buffer (450 mM Tris, 1800 mM NaCI, pH 8.0), and a microplate<br>
reader (Molecular Devices). IC50 experiments were conducted by fixing the enzyme and<br>
substrate concentrations (10 nM enzyme, 0.7 mM substrate) and varying the inhibitor<br>
concentration. Changes in absorbance at 405 nM were monitored using the software<br>
program Softmax (Molecular Devices), upon addition of enzyme, with and without inhibitor<br>
present at 37QC for 30 minutes. Percent inhibition was calculated by comparing the initial<br>
reaction slopes of the samples without inhibitor to those with inhibitor. ICS0 vafues were<br>
determined using a four parameter fit logistics model. The term "NT' indicates a compounc<br>

Anti-Asthmatic Effects in a Sheep Model of Asthma<br>
The efficacy of Compound 17 for the treatment of asthma was evaluated in a<br>
validated model of Ascaris suum antigen-induced asthmatic response in conscious sheep<br>
(Abraham, W.M., Pharmacology of allergen-induced early and late airway responses and<br>
antigen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness in allergic sheep, Pulmonary Pharmacology,<br>
1989, 2, 33-40)..<br>
Experimental Protocol<br>
Baseline (BSL) dose response curves to aerosol carbachol were obtained from<br>
historical control responses prior to antigen challenge. Baseline values of specific lung<br>
resistance (SRL) were obtained and the sheep were then given a specified amount (mg) of<br>
the test compound as an inhaled aerosol or as a oral dose at a specified time before<br>
antigen challenge. Post-drug measurements of SRL were obtained and the sheep were<br>
then challenged with Ascaris suum antigen. Measurements of SRL were obtained<br>
immediately after challenge, hourly from 1-6 h after challenge and on the half-hour from<br>
61/2-8 h after challenge. Measurements of SRL were obtained 24 h after challenge followed<br>
by a 24 h post-challenge with carbachol to measure airway hyperreactivity.<br>
Compound 17 was administered as an aerosol at 4.5 mg/dose (ca. 0.1 mg/Kg/dose,<br>
based on a 45 Kg sheep), twice-a-day {BID) for three consecutive days, followed by a dose<br>
on day 4, 0.5 h prior to antigen challenge. Ascaris suum antigen challenge was given at<br>
the zero time point.<br>
Compound 17 was administered as an oral solution at 15 mg/Kg/dose, twice-a-day<br>
{BID) for three consecutive days, followed by a dose on day 4,2 h prior to antigen<br>
challenge. Ascaris suum antigen challenge was given at the zero time point.<br>
Figure 1 shows that after aerosol administration the early airway response (0-2 h<br>

Procedural Overview<br>
Male Sprague Dawley rats, weighing 250-300 g, were fasted overnight then dosed<br>
by oral gavage at a level of 15 mg/kg with a compound. Compounds were formulated in<br>
20% hydroxy-beta-cyclo dextran.<br>
Blood samples (0.5 mL) were collected into lithium heparinized tubes at 0.5,1.0 and<br>
2.0 h post dose via orbital sinus puncture. Blood samples were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for<br>
~3 min for cell removal, approximately 200 uL of plasma supernatant was then transferred<br>
to a clean vial, frozen then placed on dry ice and delivered to SFBC Analytical Labs, Inc. for<br>
analysis.<br>
Plasma samples were prepared as follows. Two hundred microliters of acetonitrile<br>
containing 1 (iM internal standard was added to 100 uL of plasma to precipitate proteins.<br>
Samples were centrifuged at 5000 g for 5 min and supernatant removed for'analysis by<br>
LC-MS. Two hundred microliters of water was added to adjust sample solvent strength<br>
and prevent peak splitting. Calibration standards were prepared by adding appropriate<br>
volumes of stock solution directly into plasma and treated identically to collected plasma<br>
samples. Calibration standards were prepared in the range of 0.1 to 10 m-M for<br>
quantitation. LC-MS analysis was performed using MRM (Multiple Reaction Monitoring)<br>
detection of characteristic ions for each drug candidate and internal standard.<br>
