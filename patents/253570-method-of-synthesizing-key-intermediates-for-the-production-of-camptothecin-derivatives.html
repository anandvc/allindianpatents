Technical field:<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparation of 2-amino-5-hydroxypropiophenone, a key intermediate for the synthesis of camptothecin analogs including 7-Ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin and novel intermediates thereof.<br>
Background and prior art<br>
Camptothecin, (herein referred as CPT) a natural alkaloid isolated from the bark of Camptotheca acuminata is known to possess antitumor activity by inhibition of nucleic acid synthesis. Due to some severe side effects of this natural compound, various camptothecin derivatives have been synthesized with reduced toxicity and enhanced antitumor activity. One such compound is 7-ethyl-10-[4-(l-piperidino)-l-piperidino] carbonyloxycamptothecin hydrochloride trihydrate (Generic name: irinotecan; herein referred to as CPT-11).<br>
Camptothecin analogs such as CPT-11 and others are derived by a chemical synthesis from CPT, which is obtained from plant sources. However, the amount of CPT obtained from natural plant source is extremely low and the purity of the final CPT-11 is also low (-97%) due to the contamination of related natural products. Further, the demand for CPT-11 is increasing and the supply of CPT is gradually reducing. Several reports have appeared on the total synthesis of CPT and CPT-11, but till recently no synthetic method has been exploited for commercial production.<br>
Various methods for the synthesis of camptothecin and camptothecin analogs are known in the art. These synthetic methods include (i) methods in which naturally occurring camptothecin is synthetically modified to produce a number of analogs and (ii) totally synthetic methods.<br>
U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,604,463; 4,545,880; and 4,473,692 and European patent application No. 0074256 are examples of the former type of synthetic strategy. All these methods require naturally occurring camptothecin, which is difficult to isolate and hence these methods are not suitable for large scale production of camptothecin or analogs.<br><br>
Examples of total synthetic routes to camptothecin and camptothecin analogs can be found in the following references: J. Org. Chem., 40 (14), 2140-1 (1975); J. Chem. Soc, Perkin Trans 1, (5), 1563-8 (1981); J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 94 (10), 3631-2 (1972); J. Chem. Soc. D, (7), 404 (1970), U.S. Pat. No. 4031098, Chem. Pharm. Bull, 39, 1446-54 (1991); J. Org. Chem., 62, 6588-97, (1997).<br>
The best method known till now is to synthesize the two key intermediates (1 and 4) or (3 and 4) and condense by Friedlander reaction to give either CPT or 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (herein referred to as SN-38) via its methyl ether and then converting SN-38 to CPT-11 (Scheme -1)<br><br>
Patent Application no. US2004/0106830 Al discloses the preparation of AB ring (2-amino-5-hydroxycamptothecin) for CPT-11 synthesis starting from either 5-hydroxy-2-nitrobenzaldehyde or from 5-benzyloxy-2-nitrobenzaldehyde as shown in the scheme 2<br><br><br>
There are several disadvantages in making 2-amino-5-hydroxyprpiophenone from 5-hydroxy-2-nitrobenzaldehyde, which itself is more expensive and involves several steps for its synthesis. In the first step, the Grignard reaction results in substantial formation of byproducts and the isolation of pure compound (9) is tedious. Further, in the final reduction of compound 10, it is difficult to avoid small amounts of 2-amino-5-hydroxypropylbenzene as byproduct, due to the reduction of the carbonyl group.<br>
Objectives of the invention<br>
The objective of the present invention is to provide a suitable method of producing 2-amino-5-hydroxypropiophenone (herein referred to as compound 11) corresponding to AB ring (part of camptothecin from readily available 3-halobenzaldehyde. The reactions are simple to perform and have practical utility.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention discloses a process for efficient production of 2-amino-5-hydroxypropiophenone corresponding to the AB ring part of camptothecin (CPT) skeleton, which is a key intermediate useful for the total synthesis of camptothecin analogs such as SN-38 and CPT-11.<br>
In one aspect, the present invention discloses a process for preparation of 2-amino-5-hydroxypropiophenone (11) which comprises;<br>
i) reaction of 3-halobenzaldehyde (12), with Grignard reagent under<br>
inert atmosphere to give compound (13);<br><br><br><br>
vi) reduction of the nitro group of compound (17) to obtain compound (11).<br>
2-amino-5-hydroxypropiophenone (11) is used to prepare SN-38 (6) by condensing with (S)-trione (4) under Friedlander condition using acidic medium, which is further converted to Irinotecan (CPT-11). Irinotecan is deesterified in vivo to the active metabolite, 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38).<br>
Detailed description of invention<br>
According to the present invention, there is a process provided for efficient synthesis of AB ring part of camptothecin or analogs. Thus 2-amino-5-hydroxypropiophenone<br><br>
is made starting from 3-halobenzaldehyde by a simple and commercially feasible approach. The method can be adopted to synthesize 2-amino-5-hydroxy phenyl alkyl ketones. The alkyl group can be 1 to 6 carbons, and if required, can be extended either linear or branched alkyl chain.<br>
As a typical synthetic route, the following scheme describes the present invention.<br><br>
In step 1 compound (13) is obtained by reacting a 3-halobenzaldehyde (12) preferably 3-Fluorobenzaldehyde with a Grignard reagent in an inert atmosphere. Ethyl magnesium bromide is preferred. Ethyl magnesium chloride, ethyl magnesium iodide and the like can be equally useful in carrying out this operation. As an inert gas, nitrogen is preferred in view of its cost but any of the noble gasses such as argon, helium etc can be used. The Grignard reagent is prepared by reacting ethyl halide with magnesium in tetrahydrofuran (referred as THF) or solvent ether. The temperature of the reaction is preferably between 0 to 10°C during the addition and then left at ambient temperature few hours, for completion of reaction. After the reaction, the reaction solution is quenched with saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution and extracted with a solvent. The solvent is removed to give sufficiently pure alcohol (13) to carry forward for the next reaction.<br>
Compound (13) is oxidized to give 3-halopropiophenone (14). The preferred oxidizing agent is Jones reagent (C^Os/FhSC^). Other reagents can also conveniently be used. For example, manganese dioxide; Dess-Martin periodinane; PCC; PDC; DMSO/Oxalylchloride/triethyl       amine(Swern       oxidation);       TEMPO-sodium<br><br>
hypochlorite and the like. Oxidation of (13) is carried out in solvent, preferably acetone. During the oxidation, the temperature of the reaction is maintained between 0 to 10°C and the Jones reagent in aqueous sulfuric acid is added in acetone to the compound (13) Acetone is removed after the oxidation of (13) completes and the reaction mass is extracted with an organic solvent. The organic layer is washed with water, dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated. As solvent, chloroform, methylene chloride (DCM), ethyl acetate, toluene etc can be used and in particular DCM is preferable. The oxidation reaction takes 2 to 4 hrs to complete.<br>
5-halo-2-nitropropiophenone (15) can be obtained by nitrating 3-halopropiophenone (14) using a nitrating agent. Nitrating agent is selected from nitrating mixture of nitric acid and sulfuric acid or fuming nitric acid. Fuming nitric acid is preferred for nitration. The nitration is carried out with or without solvent. During the nitration, the temperature is controlled by external cooling. The preferred temperature to carry out the nitration reaction is -5° to 5°C. The nitration is completed within 6 to 10 hrs depending upon the batch size. At the end of nitration, the reaction solution is poured over ice or ice/water mixture and stirred to give solid. The nitro compound (15) is extracted with a solvent such as DCM or chloroform and washed with water. The solvent is removed to give the desired nitro compound (15). The compound (15) obtained in the above step is pure enough to carry forward to the next step.<br>
Compound (15) is then converted to a 5-protected or 5-unprotected propiophenone derivative. The protected derivative wherein R is methyl is obtained by treating compound (14) with a suitable alkoxide. Wherein R is methyl, the methanolic solution of a hydroxide is used. Methanolic sodium hydroxide is preferred. Other hydroxides in alcohol can also be used. The above reaction is carried at 0 - 10°C for 2 to 5 hrs. After the completion of the reaction, the alkaline medium is acidified to adjust the pH~2-4 with mineral acid and the solvent is removed. The extraction is carried out with a solvent, preferably DCM and organic layer, washed with water. The solvent is removed to give 5-methoxy-2-nitropropiophenone, which is sufficiently pure to take to the next step.<br>
The protected derivative wherein R is ethyl is obtained by treating compound (14) with sodium hydroxide in ethyl alcohol to give 5-ethoxy-2-nitropropiophenone, using similar procedures mentioned above.<br><br>
Optionally, 5-halo-2-nitropropiophenone (15) can directly be converted to 5-hydroxy-2-nitropropiophenone (17) by heating with inorganic base in aqueous medium.<br>
The 5-alkoxy compound can be smoothly converted to the corresponding phenolic compounds by deprotection on reacting with HBr, HI, Lewis acids, mercaptans, and the like by known procedures and also by heating with metal salts in suitable polar solvent. The said polar solvents are selected from DMF, DSMO, DMA or N-methyl pyrrolidine.<br>
The preferred method of demethylating 5-methoxy-2-nitropropiophenone to give 5-hydroxy-2-nitropropiophenone (17) is by heating with lithium chloride in DMF at reflux temp for 2 to 10 hrs. Deprotection can also be effected with Lewis acids. Thus, the 5-ethoxy compound is deprotected using Z11CI2 in cone. HC1.<br>
Compound (17) is purified by diluting the crude mixture with water and extracting into ethyl acetate and removal of solvent. Isolation of pure 5-hydroxy-2-nitropropiophenone may require use of silica gel column chromatography.<br>
The compound (17) is then converted to 2-amino-5-hydroxypropiophenone (11) by reduction of the nitro group using reducing agent. The compound (17) can be reduced using various reducing agents including hydrogenation in presence of any suitable catalyst such as Raney nickel or Pd/C. The preferred method of reducing compound (17) is by sodium dithionite in alkaline medium. Thus compound (17) is taken in methanol and added to a suspension of sodium dithionate and sodium carbonate in water and the reaction is best carried out at 0 to 30° C for 2 to 5 hrs to obtain 2-amino-5-hydroxypropiophenone.<br>
The 2-amino-5-hydroxypropiophenone thus obtained is purified by crystallization from suitable organic solvent. Toluene is the preferred solvent for the crystallization of compound. The compound thus obtained is more than 98% pure, by HPLC.<br>
The 2«amino-5-hydroxypropiophenone (11), thus obtained is condensed with cyclic triketone (4) by Friedlander reaction, known in the art, in toluene in presence of acetic acid and p-toluene sulfonic acid to give SN-38. The said reaction is carried out at 100°<br><br>
C for 15-20 hrs. The solvent is removed, reaction mass taken in acetic acid and diluted with ethanol to provide SN-38 as a colourless compound, having purity greater than 99.5%.<br>
