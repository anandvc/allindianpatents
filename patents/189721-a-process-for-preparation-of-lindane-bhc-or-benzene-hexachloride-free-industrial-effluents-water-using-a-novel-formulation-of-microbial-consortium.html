				<td>This invention relates to a process for preparation of lindane (BHC or benzene hexachloride ) free industrial effluents /water using a novel formulation of microbial consortium.<br>
This invention particularly relates to the development of a formulation for elimination of lindane residues from industry effluents and water bodies through biodegradation.<br>
Lindane is the insecticidal component of the most extensively used organochlorine pesticide which is commonly known as benzene hexachloride (BHC) or gammaxane. This is the gamma-isomer of hexachlorocyclohexane (gamma-HCH). Due to extensive and indiscriminate use of this powerful insecticide this has emerged as one of the major environmental pollutants in India and other third world countries. This compound is recalcitrant and persists in the environment for several years. Partial degradation of lindane to various intermediary metabolites in soil, particularly in flooded fields, has been reported. Refernce may<br>
be made to Deo, P.G., Karanth,N.G and Karanth,N.G.K., 1994, Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 20: 57-78 and Kumar,S., Mukerji,K.G. and Lal.R., 1996, Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 22: 1-26.  The drawbacks are that! toxic intermediates are generated which accumulate, thus not resulting in complete detoxification.  However, reports on complete mineralization of gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane by microorganisms under aerobic conditions are very few.   Reference may be made to Kunhi, A.A.M. 1995. In R.Sankaran and K.S. Manja (eds) Microbes for Better Living. MICON-94 and 34th Ann.Conf.AMI (Nov. 1994), DFRL, Mysore for a review of this. Pseudomorzas pauciflioJbilis SS88 (Senoo,K. and Wada, H. 1989, Soil Sci. Plant Nutr. 35: 79-87), Pseudomonas sp.  (Sahu,S.K., Patnaik, K.K., Sharmila, M and Sethunathan, N. 1990, Appl .Environ.Microbiol. 56: 3620-3622) and Sphingomonas paucimobilis (Bhuyan, S. Sreedharan,<br>
3., Adhya, T.K. and Sethunathan, N. 1993, Pestic.Sci. 38: 49-55)<br>
have been,shown to degrade lindane.  The drawbacks are that all<br>
these organisms degrade lindane at very low concentrations (8-11 ug/ml). Hence, it is imperative to develop a process by which high concentrations of lindane can be degraded. Mixed microbial cultures can be acclimated to higher and higher concentrations of lindane in the laboratory and a consortium that can degrade lindane residues from industry effluents and contaminated water bodies can be developed.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of a formulation useful  for the degradation of benzenehexachloride (BHC).<br>
Another object of the present invention is to prepare a formulation for the treatment of HCH-industry effluents for elimination of lindane and other pesticide residues.<br>
In the drawings accompanying this specification Figure-1 represents Degradation of 25 ug/ml lindane by the defined mixed microbial culture CFR2002 -0- growth (total biomass protein) , -0-residual lindane and -X- inorganic chloride released. Figure 2 represents Mineralization of 50 ug/ml of lindane by the defined mixed microbial culture CFR2002. All symbols are as in Fig. 1. Figure 3 represents Degradation of 100 ug/ml of lindane by the defined mixed microbial culture CFR2002. All symbols are as in Fig.l. Figure 4 represents Effect of pH of the medium on degradation of 10 ug/ml of lindane by the defined mixed microbial culture CFR2002. And Figure 5 represents Effect of incubation temperature on the degradation of 10 ug/ml of lindane by the defined mixed microbial culture CFR2002. The cultures were incubated at different temperature for 20 h without shakinq.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for preparation of lindane (BHC or benzene hexachloride ) free industrial effluents /water , characterized in using a novel formulation of microbial consortium in powder form comprising equal proportions for organisms consisting of novel mutated strains of pseudomonas and fusarium<br>
having characteristics as herein described , the said process comprises treating lindane industry effluents water bodies and other contaminated material having lindane residue with powder of said formulation of microbial consortium in treatment plant, under agitation at 150 rpm for a time period ranging 3 - 24 h to get lindane free effluents or water.<br>
The  enzymatic   formulation obtained  is   intracellular  in nature .<br>
In an embodiment  of  the present  invention benzenehexachloride (BHC)   used  may  be   alpha-,   beta-,   gamma-,   delta-   and  epsilon-isomers  or mixture   thereof   and employed  in  the   range  of   10-100 ppm.<br>
In   another   embodiment   of   the   present   invention      the cultivation   is   effected   at   room   temperature   under   shaking conditions  for at  least  48  h.<br>
In  yet   another  enboditnent   of   the  present   invention,   the cultivation  is  effected  in  standard -culture  media  at   a wide  pH range of  5.0-8.0.<br>
A mixed microbial culture (consortium CFR2002) was prepared by incorporating nine bacterial strains (different species of Pseudojnonas) and a fungal strain (Fusarium sp.) (Table 1) and was mutated to degrade increasing concentrations of gamma-HCH in the medium. This defined mixed culture could completely mineralize 100 ug/ml lindane within 48 h in shake flasks. The mixed culture could degrade lindane at a fairly wide range of pH (4.0-8.5) and temperature (5-60°C). This microbial mixed culture can be effectively deployed for treatment cf lindane industry effluents, water bodies, soil and other materials contaminated with lindane residues.<br>
A novel  process was developed for elimination of  lindane<br>
residues   from industrial  effluents  and other  contaminated<br>
materials using a mixed microbial culture. A microbial consortium<br>
was developed by enrichment of a mixture of BHC-contaminated soil<br>
(collected  from sugarcane fields) and  sewage  (collected  from<br>
Mysore  Municipal Corporation Sewage Treatment Plant)  in  shake<br>
flasks  containing  gamma-HCH as the sole source of  carbon and<br>
energy.  The  microbial consortium that got  established  in  the<br>
medium containing  10  ug/ml of  gamma-HCH was  resolved  into<br>
several  bacterial  and fungal strains. Individual  strains  were<br>
tested for their ability to degrade lindane. All  the bacterial<br>
strains  and a fungal strain were able to degrade  10  ug/ml  of<br>
gamma-HCH and failed to degrade  higher  concentrations.  Nine<br>
bacterial strains identified as different species of  Pseudomonas<br>
and the fungal strain belonging to Fusarium were mixed and  the<br>
mixed culture could degrade higher concentrations of gamma-HCH.<br>

The mutants of the above cultures have been developed by subjecting them to increasing concentrations of lindane used as a sole source of carbon and energy, by conventional enrichment techniques.<br>
Gamma-HCH used was 99% pure and was obtained from Sigma Chemical Company, U.S.A., Other chemicals used in the media and reagents were of analytical grade and were obtained from standard Indian Companies.<br>
The  basal mineral medium used for enrichment and for growth of  the  individual  cultures  as  well  as  the  mixed   culture (Consortium CFR2002)  contained (per litre of  distilled water) 0.675  g  KH2P04; 5.455 g.Na2HPO4; 0.25 g NH4NO3;  0.2  g  MgSO4. 7H2O;  0.1  g  Ca  (NO3)2 and 1  ml  of  trace  mineral  solution containing  (mg/ml) FeSO4.7H20, 1.0; MnS04.H2O, 1.0;  CuCl2.2H2O, 0.25;  Na2MoO4.2H2O, 0.25; and H3BO3  0.10. The pH of the  medium was 7.5. Required amount of  gamma-HCH was added to the medium as described  later.  For studying the effect of  pH on  gamma-HCH degradation, the required pH was adjusted by altering the buffer salt concentrations or by the additions of acid (HNO3) or  alkali (NaOH) solutions.<br>
Nutrient agar plates were used for resolving the different bacterial strains from the consortium as well as for the study of their taxonomy. Nutrient agar medium contained 3.0 g beef extract, 5 g peptone, 5 g NaCl and 20 g agar agar per litre of distilled water (pH 7.0). Fungal strains were isolated and grown on potato-dextrose agar (infusion of 200 g potato, 20 g dextrose and 20 g agar-per litre, pH 5.5) .<br>
The cultivation of individual strains as well as the consortium in shake flasks was carried out in 50 ml of mineral medium containing required amount of growth substrate (gamma-<br>
HCH), taken in 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks and incubating at 30|C on a rotary shaker (150 rpm), For maintaining the individual strains as well as the mixed culture, mineral agar plates/slopes containing gamma-HCH (25 ug/rnl) were used. The culture was incubated for 4-5 days at 30|C and then preserved at 4|C. The mixed culture was maintained in liquid culture also, after growing it in mineral salts medium with 25 ug/ml gamma-HCH for 24 h and storing it at 4JC.<br>
The growth of the mixed culture was determined by estimating the total protein in the biomass by a modified method of Lowry (Lowry, O.H., Rosebrough, N.J., Farr, A.L. and Randall, R.J. 1951. J.Biol.Chem 193: 265-285) as follows. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with distilled water and suspended in 3.4 ml of distilled water 0.6 ml of 20% NaOH was added, mixed and digested in a boiling water bath for 5 min. Total protein in cooled sample was determined by Lowry's method using Folin-Ciocalteau reagent.<br>
Quantitative estimation of chloride was done by mercury  (II) thiocyanate  method  (Bergmann,  J.G.  and  Sanik Jr.J.   1957. Anal.Chem.  29:  241-243).  To 2 ml of  aliquot  of  the  culture supernatant  0.2  ml  of  0.25M ammonium  iron  (III)   sulphate [NH4Fe(SO4)2.12H2O] in 9 M nitric acid was added followed by the addition of  0.2  ml of a saturated solution of  mercury  (II) thiocyanate  in ethanol. Absorbance of the sample  solution was measured at  460 nm by a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-160 A, Japan).  The amount of chloride was computed from a standard a curve prepared for NaCl.<br>
Quantitative determination of the substrate residue (lindane) was done either by thin layer chromatography (TLC) or by gas chromatography with 63Ni electron capture detector (BCD). The culture broth was extracted thrice with equal volume of a mixture<br>
of hexane: acetone (8:1) by mixing thoroughly each time. The solvent layer was pooled, evaporated and redissolved in convenient volume of hexane. Known volume was loaded on to silica gel G coated plate (0.3 mm) and developed in cyclohexane. The plate was air dried and gamma-HCH was detected by spraying the plate with 2% solution of o-tolidin in acetone. The spots were delineated by marking with a needle and the area was measured. The concentration was computed from a standard plot of log concentrations vs. square root of the area, prepared for pure gamma-HCH.<br>
For gas chromatographic determination of the gamma-HCH residues, the hexane extract was passed through a florisil column to remove impurities. Shimadzu ISA (Japan) gas chromatograph with 63Ni detector was used. The conditions used were as follows: Column; 2 mm l.D. and 200 mm length packed with 1.5% OV-17+1.95 QF1 on 80-100 mesh chromosorb W,; carrier gas, nitrogen; flow at 40 ml/min,, column temperature 210|C, injector temperature 230|C and detector temperature 300|C.<br>
The enrichment of a mixture of BHC-contaminated sugar cane field soil (collected from the outskirts of Mysore City) and sewage (collected from the Mysore City Municipal Corporation sewage treatment plant) was done in shake flasks using a mineral salts medium containing (per litre) 0.675 g KH2P04; 5.455 g Na2HPO4; 0.25 g NH4N03; 0.2 g MgS04.7H20; 0.1 g Ca(N03)2 and 1 ml of trace minerals solution containing (in mg/ml) FeSO4. 7H2O, 1.0; MnS04.H20, 1.0; NaMoO4, 0.25; H3BO3, 0.1 and CuCl2.2H20, 0.25). Gamma-HCH (lindane) was used as the sole source of carbon and energy at 10 ug/ml concentration. A cloth-filtered aqueous suspension of soil and sewage was added as inoculum (5 ml) to 50 ml medium taken in 250 ml conical flasks. The culture was incubated at 30|C on a rotary shaker (150 rpm). After one week 5 ml of the culture broth was inoculated to fresh 50 ml medium<br>
having the same composition and 10 ug/ml of gamma-HCH. After 5 such  transfers  the  broth was analysed  for  chloride  release. Stoichiometric   amount  of  Cl~  was  detected  in  the  medium indicating  complete  mineralization  of  the  added  gamma-HCH. Appropriately diluted culture broth was plated on nutrient  agar and potato-dextrose agar. Nine different bacterial  strains  and one  fungal  strain was isolated. These individual  strains  were screened  for  their ability  to degrade  gamma-HCH.  All  the bacterial strains and the fungal strain degraded upto 10 ug/ml of gamma-HCH when inoculated individually. However, they failed  to degrade  higher  concentrations of the substrate.  When all  the bacterial   strains  and the  fungal  strain  were   inoculated degradation of 25 ug/ml of  gamma-HCH was observed.<br>
The individual bacterial strains were identified according to Bergey's Manual of Determinative Bacteriology and all of them were found to belong to the genus Pseudomonas (Table 1). All these strains were distinctly different in their morphological and biochemical characteristics. The fungus was identified as a species of Fusarium (Table 1).<br>
Table 1:  The list of microorganisms present in the gamma-HCH degrading mixed culture CFR2002<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
The cultures are deposited	in CFTRI Culture Collection Centre.<br>
The mixed microbial culture, consortium CFR2002 was acclimatized to higher and higher concentration of gamma-HCH (from 25 ug/ml to 100 ug/ml). With acclimation the rate of degradation of gamma-HCH improved significantly. The time taken for complete mineralization of 100 ug/ml of gamma-HCH by the unacclimated mixed culture was 14 days. The acclimated culture took only 48 h for complete degradation of 100 ug/ml of gamma-HCH with concomitant release of stoichiometric amount of chloride.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE-1<br>
To  test  the  efficiency of the  defined mixed culture  to completely degrade  gamma-HCH (lindane) the following experiments were  done: 25 ml mineral medium was taken in 250 ml flasks.  The mineral medium contained 0.675 g KH2PO4, 5.455 g Na2HPO4, 0.25  g NH4NO3,  0.2  g MgSO4.7H2O, 0.1 g.Ca(NO3)2 and  1  ml  of  trace mineral  solution per litre of distilled water.  The  substrate, gamma-HCH was added at 25 ppm (25 ug/ml). The required amount  of the substrate was dissolved in 50 ul of acetone and was added at the bottom of dry, sterile flask inside a laminar hood and kept open till  the  acetone was completely evaporated.  Then  25  ml mineral  medium was added and inoculated with the cells  of  the mixed culture. The inoculum added was cells equivalent to 64  ug protein per ml. The flasks were incubated on a rotary shaker  at 150  rpm at 30|C. Samples were drawn at regular intervals of 3  h and  analysed  for  growth  (total  biomass  protein),  inorganic chloride (Cl~) and residual substrate. The results are  presented in   Fig.l  (Sheet  No.l)  of  the  drawing   accompanying   this specification.  Complete  disappearenc'e  of  the  substrate   and<br>
release of 100% Cl was observed after 24 h incubation. Biomass almost doubled during this period. These observations clearly indicate that gamma-HCH (25 ug/ml) was completely mineralized.<br>
The  microbial mass was separated by centrifugation  at  8000 rpm for 10 min and lyophilised by freeze drying.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Degradation of   50  ug/ml gamma-HCH by  the  mixed culture, consortium CFR2002 was studied in shake flasks as follows: 25 ml mineral 'medium was taken in 250 ml flasks. The  mineral  medium contained  0.675 g KH2PO4, 5.455 g Na2HPO4, 0.25 g NH4NO3, 0.2  g MgSO4.7H2O, 0.1 g Ca(NO3)2 and 1 ml of trace mineral solution per litre of distilled water. The substrate,  gamma-HCH was added at 25 ppm  (25 ug/ml). The required amount of  the  substrate was dissolved in 50 ul of acetone and was added at the bottom of dry, sterile  flask  inside  a laminar hood and kept  open  till  the acetone was completely evaporated. Then 25 ml mineral medium was added and  inoculated with the cells of the mixed  culture.  The inoculum added was cells equivalent to 64 ug protein per ml.  The flasks  were  incubated on a. rotary shaker at 150  rpm at  30 |C. Samples were drawn at regular intervals of 3 h and analysed  for growth  (total  biomass protein), inorganic  chloride  (Cl~)  and residual  substrate. Inoculum used was the cells  collected  from the  previous  experiment   (Example   I).   The  cells  were pelleted,washed thoroughly amd added as inoculum.<br>
About 98% of the substrate (50 ug/ml gamma-HCH) disappeared and more than 80% Cl" was released withing 24 h of incubation. Complete disapperence of the substrate and 100% Cl~ release occured after 48 h (Fig 2., Sheet No.2) of the drawing accompanying this specification.<br>
The  microbial mass was separated by centrifugation  at  8000 rpm for 10 min and lyophilised by freeze drying.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
The  degradative  ability  of the mixed  culture  CFR2002  to mineralize  100  ug/ml of  gamma-HCH was tested. 25  ml  mineral medium was taken in 250 ml flasks. The mineral medium contained 0.675 g KH2PO4, 5.455 g Na2HP04, 0.25 g NH4NO3, 0.2 g MgS04.7H2O, 0.1 g Ca(NO3)2 and 1 ml of trace mineral solution per litre of distilled water. The substrate,  gamma-HCH was added at  25  ppm (25 ug/ml). The required amount of the substrate was dissolved in 50  ul  of acetone and was added at the bottom of  dry,  sterile flask  inside a laminar hood and kept open till the  acetone  was completely evaporated. Then 25 ml mineral medium was  added and inoculated with the cells of the mixed culture. The inoculum was added and the flasks were incubated on a rotary shaker at 150 rpm at  30|C.  Samples  were drawn at regular intervals of  3  h and analysed  for growth (total biomass protein), inorganic  chloride (Cl~)  and residual substrate. Substrate concentrations were  100 ug/ml  and the inoculum size was 25 ug protein/ml  equivalent  of cells.  The  cells collected from the  previous  experiment  were washed and used as inoculum.<br>
Almost  complete disappearence of the substrate  (100  ug/ml) and release of stoichiometric amounts of Cl~ was observed within an incubation period of 48 h. The biomass increased from 25 ug to about 150 ug protein per ml during this period.<br>
The microbial mass was separated by centrifugation at  8000 rpm for 10 min and lyophilised by freeze drying.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
The  effect of pH on the degradation of lindane by the  mixed culture CFR-2002 was studied by varying the pH of the medium from 3.0 to 11.0. The pH was altered by changing the concentrations of the buffering salts KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4 or by adjusting with  HN03 or NaOH solution at the two extremities, 2B ml mineral medium wens taken in 250 ml flasks. The mineral medium contained required amounts of KH2PO4, and Na2HP04 to obtain the required pH, 0.25  g NH4NO3,  0.2  g MgSO4.7H2O, 0.1 g Ca(NO3)2 and  1  ml  of  trace mineral  solution per litre of distilled water.  The  substrate, gamma-HCH was added at 25 ppm (25 ug/ml). The required amount  of the substrate was dissolved in 50 ul of acetone and was added  at the  bottom of dry, sterile flask inside a laminar hood and  kept open  till  the  acetone was completely evaporated.  Then  25  ml mineral  medium was added arid inoculated with the cells  of  the mixed  culture. The inoculum added was cells equivalent to 64  ug protein  per ml. The flasks were incubated on a rotary shaker  at 150  rpm at 30|c. Samples were drawn at regular intervals of 3  h and analysed  for growth  (total  biomass  protein),  inorganic chloride (Cl~) and residual substrate. 10 ug/ml of gamma-HCH was added as  substrate. The cultures were incubated for 20 h on a rotory shaker at 30|C.<br>
The mixed culture wat) able t,o degrade gamma-HCH at a wide pil range from 3.0-9.0 (Fig 4. sheet No.4). However, the best activity was observed at pH ranging from 6.5 to 7.5.<br>
The microbial mass was separated by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 10 min and lyophilised by freeze drying.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
The effect of temperature on degradation of gamma-HCH by the microbial mixed culture CFR2002 was studied by growing the cultures at 5,8,20,25,30,35,40,50 and 60°C under stationary conditions. 10 ml mineral medium containing 10 ug/ml substrate was taken in 100 ml conical flasks and were inoculated with cells grown previously with 100 ug/ml substrate, after a thorough wash. They were incubated at different temperatures without shaking, for 20 h.<br>
Degradation of the added substrate, as indicated by Cl~ release, was observed at a wide range of temperature (from 5° to 60°C), the optimum degradation being afe 35°C (Fig.5; Sheet No.5).<br>
The microbial mass was separated by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 10 min and lyophilised by freeze drying.<br>
