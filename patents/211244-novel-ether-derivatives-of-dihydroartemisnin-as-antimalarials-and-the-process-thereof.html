				<td>This invention relates to a novel ether derivatives of dihydroartemisinin and the process thereof.<br>
This invention relates to a novel ether derivatives of dihydroartemisinin useful as antimalarials.<br>
This invention also relates to a process for the preparation of novel ether derivatives of dihydroartemisinin.<br>
This invention particularly relates to a process for the preparation of w-succinoyloxyalkyl ethers of dihydroartemisinin of formula 7 as a new series of water-soluble antimalarial agents.<br>
The present invention provides a process for the preparation of w-succinoyloxy ethers of dihydroartemisinin of formula 7. Dihydroartemisinin (2) is an antimalarial, easily available by NaBH4 reduction of naturally occurring antimalarial artemisinin (1). Both artemisinin and dihydroartemisinin are insoluble in water and cannot be administered as aqueous solutions. Artesunic acid (3) and artelinic acid (4) are known water-soluble derivatives of dihydroartemisinin and both have antimalarial activity. While artesunic acid has poor stability in aqueous solutions, synthesis of artelinic acid requires methyl p-hydroxymethyl benzoate, a costly chemical [For recent reviews on artmisinin and its derivatives, including water soluble derivatives see : (a) Meshnick S.R.; Tayler, T.E.; Kamchonwonpaisan, S. Microbial Rev, 1996, 60, 301. (b) Gumming, J.N.; Ploypradith, P.; Posner, G.H. Adv. Pharmacol, 1997, 37,2253. (c) Haynes, R.K.; Vonwiller, S.C. Ace. Chem. Res. 1997, 30, 73. (d) Ziffer, H., Highet, R.J.; Klayman, D.L. Prog. Chem. Org. Nat. Prod. 1997, 72, 123 ].<br>
The main objective of this invention is to provide novel water-soluble ether derivatives of dihydroartemisinin. The objective of this invention is also to provide novel ether derivatives of dihydroartemisinin.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a process for the preparation of novel ether derivatives of dihydroartemisinin which are water soluble and are useful as antimalarials.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides novel ether derivatives of dihydroartemisinin of formula 7 given below wherein n is 2 to 12 useful as antimalarials prepared by the process described herein:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The process of preparation of novel ether derivatives of dihydroartemisinin has been disclosed and claimed in our copending application no.:211 Del 2000<br>
Compounds of formula 7 are hemisuccinate derivatives, and are soluble in aqueous bicarbonate solutions. These compounds have been tested against multi-drug resistant P. yoelii in mice and   have shown promising antimalarial activity. Thus  the invention relates to pharmaceutical industry.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the preparation of novel ether derivatives of dihydroartemisinin of formula 7 where in n is 2 to 12 which comprises reacting dihydroartemisinin of formula 2 with alkane diols of formula 5, wherein n = 2 to 12, under acidic conditions in an organic solvent under known reaction conditions to furnish ω-hydroxyalkyl ethers of formula 6, wherein n has the same meaning as above, reacting co-hydroxyalkyl ethers of formula 6 with succinic anyhdride in presence of organic base in an organic solvent in the temperature range of 0°C to   room temperature neutralizing the above reaction mixture with mineral acids isolating and purifying the ether derivatives of formula 7 wherein n has the same meaning as above by conventional methods.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the reaction of dihydroartemisinin with alkane diols may be effected under acidic conditions using acidic catalysts such as BF3.OEt2, p-toluenesulfonic acid, HCI, cation exchanger such as Amberlyst-15.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention the organic solvent used may be such as CH2Cl2, benzene, CH3CN, toluene.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the organic base used may be such as pyridine, triethylamine, 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP).<br>
In an embodiment of the invention mineral acid used for neutralization may be such as HCI, H2SO4, H3PO4-<br>
Purification of compounds of formula 7 may be carried out by column chromatography using hexane - ethylacetate, CH2CI2 - ethylacetate, CHCI3 -MeOH, benzene - ether. All these combinations have been used for purification of compound 7h. If fact any combination consisting of a non-polar solvent such as hexane, CH2CI2, CHCI3, benzene with a polar solvent such as ethylacetate, ether, methanol can be used for chromatography.<br>
In the process, dihydroartemisinin of formula 2 is reacted with alkane diols of formula 5 in presence of an acid catalyst such as BF3.OEt2, p-toluene sulfonic acid, HCI, cation exchanger such as Amberlyst-15, in an aprotic solvent such as CH2CI2, benzene, to furnish co-hydroxyalkyl ethers of formulae. Compounds of formula 6 are mixture of a and ß-isomers, they<br>
can be separated into pure a and p-isomers by known methods such as column chromatography or can be used as mixture in the next step.<br>
Compounds 6d, 6f, 6g, 6i [formula 6 ; n = 5, 8, 9, 12] are new compounds while compounds 6a, 6b, 6c, 6e, 6h [formula 6, n = 2, 3, 4, 6, 10] have been prepared earlier [Chandan Singh and Rani Kanchan, Indian Patent Application no. 5600, Date 5.9.1997].<br>
In the process w-hydroxyalkyl ethers of formula 6 are reacted with succinic anhydride in presence of a base such as Et3N, pyridine, 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP), in an organic solvent such as CH2CI2, CH3CN, toluene, to give ω-succinoyloxyalkyl ethers of formula 7. Compounds of formula 7 are hemisuccinate derivatives of compounds of formula 6. These hemisucinate derivatives of formula 7 are new compounds and have not been prepared earlier. Compounds of formula 7 have a free carboxyl group and are soluble in aqueous bicarbonate solutions.<br>
These compounds of formula 7 can be used as antimalarials either as pure isomers or as mixture of a and p-isomers. Compounds of formula 7 can be isolated and purified using standard laboratory conditions such as column chromatography on silica gel using a hydrocarbon solvent in conjuction with a polar organic solvent as eluant.<br>

Antimalarial activity<br>
The blood schizontocidal activity of the test compounds was evaluated in rodent model using multidrug resistant strain of Plasmodium yoelii Nigeriensis in swiss mice.<br>
General Procedure : Random bred swiss mice of either sex (20 ± 2 gm) were inoculated intraperitoneally with 1 x 105 P. yoelii (MDR) parasites in day O. The treatment with test compounds were administered to groups of 6<br>
mice each at different dose levels ranging between 12-96 mg/kg/day. The compounds were administered as solutions in 5% aqueous NaHCO3 solution<br>
via intramuscular route for 4 consecutive days (day 0-3). Artesunic acid was used as positive control.<br>
Blood smears from experimental mice were observed on day 4 and 7, day 10 and thereafter at regular interval till day 28 or death of the animal. The<br>
parasitaemia level on day 4 was compared with the vehicle control group and the percent suppression of parasitaemia in treated groups was calculated. The compounds which showed more than 90% suppression were identified for further screening.<br>
For determing the curative dose of a compound the treated mice were observed till day 28. The dose at which no parasitaemia develops during the observation period has been recorded as the curative dose. The results are shown in table 2.<br>
