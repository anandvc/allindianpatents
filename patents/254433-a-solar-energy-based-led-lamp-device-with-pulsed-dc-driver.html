FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This Invention relates to a solar energy based LED lamp device<br>
operated through a pulsed DC driver suitable for a table lamp and<br>
home lighting in smaller range.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Solar cell industry is not competitive due to higher cost and inefficient<br>
applications for lighting purposes. However, with the advent of Jght<br>
Emitting Diodes (LEDs), host of applications at a lesser cost with<br>
longer life and lower power consumption are possible. Hitherto, LED<br>
lights are being used either for signaling or decorative lights and not<br>
yet becoming prevalent for home lighting applications. However, the<br>
output of LED is directional, which is desirable in the case of a table<br>
lamp and house lighting in smaller range. LED lamps consuming less<br>
power as compared to Compact Fluorescent Lamp (CFL), which are<br>
regarded as power saving lighting source at present.<br>
The illuminating bulb for table lamp generally constitutes fluorescent<br>
tubes or recently introduced compact fluorescent lamps (CFL).<br><br>
However, even a smallest CFL lamp consumes not less than 5 to 10<br>
watt power in table lamps. Thus, a table lamp if operated by solar<br>
power, requires higher wattage solar module. This also increases the<br>
cost of the system. Further, solar cells deliver power In DC voltage.<br>
This is inverted to get higher voltage of operation in case of<br>
fluorescence lights. Some of the energy is lost during this inversion<br>
process also. On the other hand, light emitting diode (LED) lights are<br>
operated at DC voltage only and are quite compatible to solar<br>
modules. Therefore, applications of LEDs for home lighting systems<br>
such as table lamp are more desirable.<br>

Description of the Invention<br>
The main objective of the invention is to propose a solar-energy based LED lamp<br>
device, which provides adequate light for example (~100-200 lux) on a study table.<br><br>
According to another objective of the invention a pulsed DC driver at<br>
low voltage is applied with the LED Lamp Device to get better<br>
Illumination with low average power consumption.<br>
A further objective of the invention is to use lesser number of LEDs<br>
than the direct DC driven LED lamps to reduce the cost of the lamp.<br>
A still further objective of the invention is to propose a solar-energy-<br>
based portable LED almp device in which the LEDs are protected<br>
from over voltage damage through a control circuit.<br>
An yet another objective of the invention is to propose a solar-<br>
energy-based LED lamp device, with supply of a low power and<br>
employing a low wattage solar module to charge its batteries.<br>
As proposed In the invention the LED lights being directional Is<br>
configured to form a lighting system for illuminating a small area<br>
such as a study table for reading purpose, A LED lamp requires very<br>
less power to provide adequate light (~ 100 to 200 Lux) on the table.<br>
The power consumption of a lamp is very less ~ 0.5 to 2 Watt and its<br>
batteries can be charged using a small wattage solar module (~ 2-10<br>
Watt).<br><br>
A solar LED lamp of the present invention is constituted of a housing<br>
with a stand, a solar module, LEDs connected in series/parallel<br>
combination, with pulsed DC and voltage regulator circuit and a<br>
battery/les.<br>
According to the invention there is provided a solar energy based<br>
LED Lamp Device with pulse DC driver comprising of battery/ies<br>
charged through a crystalline silicon or other film like solar module, a<br>
pulsed DC driver circuit, a voltage regulator circuit and arrays of LEDs<br>
wherein Input DC voltage is regulated by a voltage regulator<br>
controller LM 317 through capacitor, and resistances to produce<br>
higher voltage than the input voltage via a capacitor, the said input<br>
voltage being fed to a IC controller for controlling current<br>
consumption of the output, the regulated voltage with controlled<br>
current being fed to DC Driver circuit via IC 555 controller which<br>
generates DC pulse frequencies of 50 to 200 Hz with variable duty<br>
cycles via feeding to MOSFET IRFZ 44N driver which provide power<br>
to illuminate arrays of LEDs directionally with less current within the<br>
range of 15-25 MA.<br>
The present invention will be better understood from the description<br>
with references to the accompanying drawings in which<br>
Figure 1 represents a schematic of a lamp showing various<br>
components arrangement accommodated within the lamp device.<br><br>
Figure 2 represents a schematic circuit arrangement showing pulsed<br>
DC driver circuit and voltage regulator circuit connected with the<br>
LEDs.<br>
Figure 3 represents the circuit diagram of the pulsed DC: driver<br>
interconnected with a regulator and LEDs.<br>
Figure 4 represents (a) Normal DC powering of a Three LED System<br>
and (b) Pulsed DC powering system of a Three LED system.<br>
In figure 1 LEDs pulse generator and LM 317 IC regulator are<br>
accommodated in a LED Fixture (F). Lamp support (S) provides<br>
charge controller and battery. The lamp stand (LS) provides passages<br>
for detachable leads to be interconnected with the charge controller,<br>
pulse generator, voltage regulator and LEDs to emit light. The<br>
support provides connectors for connecting solar charger.<br>
Figure 2 shows the schematic arrangement of the interconnected<br>
component of the device in which a DC supply (17) is regulated to<br>
generate a Pulsed DC through a pulsed DC driver circuit (14). The<br>
said pulsed DC generated is regulated through a voltage regulator<br>
(15) and the regulated voltage is fed to the Light Emitting Dlodes<br>
(LEDs) (16).<br><br>
Human eyes cannot detect a change quicker than 25 frames / second<br>
and if LEDs are made to operate at a frequency higher than 50 Hz, it<br>
is possible to reduce the power consumption of LEDs without<br>
affecting the visibility provided by them to a great extent This is<br>
achieved through a pulsed DC driver circuit and a voltage regulator.<br>
This way, pulsed DC driven LED tamp requires much lesser<br>
current than a direct DC driven LED lamp. The average power<br>
consumption in pulsed DC case comes out to be lesser than the<br>
direct DC driven lamp, even though the Illumination (as In one of the<br>
embodiment, It is about 150 LUX) In both the cases is equivalent<br>
The LEDs are ultra bright white with source luminance 6000 to 10000<br>
mcd disposed in the fixture at an angle between 15 degree to 70<br>
degree and maintained with size within 5 mm to 10 mm. Damages of<br>
LED's due to high voltage and overcharging of the batteries are<br>
secured by incorporating zener diode in the regulator.<br>
In Figure 3 pulse DC driver circuit consists of voltage regulator LM<br>
317 IC which control the LED current consumption by adjusting solar<br>
battery voltage supply through capacitors C1 C2 and resistances R1 &amp;<br>
R2 through 3 way connections for adjustment out and in to provide a<br>
constant voltage to the controller 7805IC. After much Iteration, a<br>
voltage between 10-11.1 volts for a set of 3 LEDs in series was found<br><br>
suitable and LEDs were found to have best output to power<br>
consumption ratio. The illumination was about 150 Lux average for a<br>
12 LED lamp covering an area of A4 size paper 7805IC has also 3<br>
way connectors to control current consumption for LEDs.<br>
The circuit in figure 3 is used to pulse LEDs at a frequency higher<br>
than 50 Hz with variable duty cycle. The circuit is based on the<br>
standard IC 555, which provides pulse with desired duty cycle to<br>
MOSFET IRFZ44N, which In turn derives the LEDs. The MOSFET<br>
allows battery voltage to pulse at a duty cycle of 50% or less lor LED<br>
lamp. The frequency and duty cycle can be adjusted by resistances<br>
Rf and Rd and capacitance Cf. The difference in the continuous DC<br>
operation and pulsed DC operation is shown in figure 4. However, for<br>
a smaller pulse width, the LEDs can be made to operate at a higher<br>
voltage with brighter glow without damage to the LED. Also,<br>
increasing the operating voltage increases the solid angle of the LED.<br>
This way same area can be covered with less number of LCDs. In<br>
figure 3 a set of three LEDs, which normally would operate at 9.9.V<br>
DC with 20mA nominal DC current, are made to operate on 50-<br>
200Hz, 10- 13V and 10-90% wide pulse DC supply without damage to<br>
the LEDs.<br>
The Solar Charger and the components of a LED lamp In one<br>
embodiment are described below:<br><br>
Solar Chargers<br>
-	Solar Module	iCrystalline sillicon or other thin film<br>
 like amorphous sillicon<br>

In the pulse driver circuit for a single LED, the window for current is<br>
15-25 mA. The LED can be operated at a little higher voltage and<br>
current (average current comes out to be lesser than the rated<br>
current) with pulsed DC voltage at different duty cycles without<br>
affecting the intensity and no damage to LED. The LEDs can be<br>
connected in series and parallel combination to provide required<br>
illumination. In a single table lamp, 12 LEDs are required to provide<br>
about 150 LUX on an A4 size paper for studying purpose. These LEDs<br>
are mounted on acrylic base as per the circuit shown in fig. 2.<br><br>
The invention as herein described is for a stand alone model of LED<br>
lamp, which has been described with reference to a table lamp as an<br>
illustration but the invention can be applied also to small home<br>
lighting purpose.<br>
The LEDs lamp housing is made of plastic or metal and is connected<br>
to the base with a flexible stem, which can be adjusted for getting<br>
the Illumination on a desired place. The LEDs are covered with<br>
transparent corrugated Acrylic for dispersion of light<br>
The table lamp is provided with detachable lead with connectors for<br>
connecting to solar charger for ease of connection.<br>
Example<br>

of 12 V, 7 AH sealed maintenance free lead acid battery. Two table<br>
lamps and one home light were connected to the battery. A table<br>
lamp is found to consume about 0.5-1 watt and provides 100-200<br>
LUX at the study table surface under the lamp, which to found to be<br>
adequate for study purpose. The system has been monitored for<br>
three months ensuring any trouble free use of the device.<br>
The invention as herein described and illustrated should not be read<br>
