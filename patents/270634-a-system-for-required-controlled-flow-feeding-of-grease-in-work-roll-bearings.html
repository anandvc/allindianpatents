				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a device for feeding of grease, in work roll bearings and,<br>
in particular, to a system for required controlled flow feeding of grease in work roll<br>
bearings, importantly, the system for feeding of grease in work roll bearings is adapted<br>
to ensure feeding of exact amount of grease in the bearings. The system can be<br>
advantageously used to feed grease in roll choke bearings and in other roiling mill areas<br>
such as finishing strands in Hot Strip Mill, Skelp Mill and the like.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
It is well known that work rolls are interchanged in Taddem Cold MilI (TCM), Double Cold<br>
Reduction (DCR) and Skin Pass Mill (SPM) in Cold Rolliog Mill complexes in steel plants.<br>
Usually, the work rolls are changed on a schedule basis, after proccssing a fixed no, of<br>
colls and subsequently are brought bo Roll Grinding and Bearing Shop (RGBS) for<br>
inspection and maintenance. Two numbers of four row taper roller grease lubricated<br>
bearings are mounted on the roll necks. Usually, such bearings are required to be dosed<br>
with specific amount of grease before they are again mounted in the mills for rolling.<br>
The amount of grease to be fed into individual bearings is pre-calculated. Feeding more<br>
amount of grease into bearings than the required amount lead to causing flooding which<br>
restrict the movement of taper rollers in the raceways. Inadequate greasing on the other<br>
hand lead to starvation in the bearing and the lubricating, film thickness between the<br>
races and rollers are not available which lead to metal-to-metal contact in the raceways,<br>
which in turn finally fead to failure of the bearings.<br>
It is apparent from the above that the lifee of a bearing depends largely on the amount of<br>
grease it contains. In roll grinding and bearing shops, feeding of grease to the bearings<br>
take place with the help of centralized grease pumps. Usually, about two numbers of<br>
gear pumps are put into service to feed the grease into the bearings. The roll choke<br>
housing by not dismended from work rolls but ports are provided to feed grease in the<br>
bearings by inserting a flexible high pressure hose. Usually low pressure high discharge<br>
gear pumps are employed to carry out the greasing of the bearings.<br>
As would be apparent from the above state of the art on feeding of grease in work roll<br>
bearings, while it is important to ensure that the amount of grease is fed to the desired<br>
level and also to take care the bearings do not suffer from low levels of grease, the<br>
system of feeding grease in bearings as presently followed in the art do not serve<br>
effectively to take care of the above requirements of gneasing of bearing. Thus, it is<br>
usually difficult to monitor the grease feed into the bearing and also to continuously<br>
2<br><br>
ensure that the bearings include effective level of grease for proper functioning. Apart<br>
from the above, problem or limitation of monitoring and controlled exact amount of<br>
feeding of grease in bearing is also experience. Moreover, since the grease fed can get<br>
contaminated, it ts also found that grease contamination also lead to bearing problems<br>
such as bearing failures. Tnere is thus also a need to check the contamination of grease<br>
being fed into the bearings to ensure effective working life of bearings.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is thus the basic object of the present invention to provide for a system for required<br>
controlled flow feeding of grease in work roll bearing which would take care of the<br>
disadvantages / limitations of the conventional devices or methods of feeding of grease<br>
in work roll bearings.<br>
Another object of the present invention is directed to a system of feeding of grease in<br>
work roll bearings which would favour monitoring the feeding of the grease In the<br>
bearings and in the process favour controlled feeding of required exact amount of grease<br>
in the bearing thereby avoiding complexities of bearing future due to unwanted high<br>
level of grease or low / nil grease in roll bearings.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is directed to a system for required high<br>
pressure flow feeding of grease in work roll bearings, which would ensure uniform<br>
distribution of grease inside the bearing to thereby achieve proper greasing of the<br>
bearing for effective performance.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is direct to a system for required flow feeding<br>
of grease in work roll bearings, which would be cost effective, user friendly and<br>
importantly require less work load for the maintenance personal in the shop floor.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is directed to an automatised system for flow<br>
feeding of grease in work roll bearings which would have alarm system for facilitating the<br>
grease transfer from the source to the bearing through the grease pump and thereby<br>
ensure effective utilization of the grease for optimum greasing of bearings of work rolls<br>
and the like.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is directed to an automatised system of flow<br>
feeding of grease in bearing and the like involving mechanical counter with digital display<br>
to favour continuous monitoring and identification of the amount of grease dosed into<br>
bearings and thereby ensure optimum and required levels of grease in the bearings for<br>
effective life, functioning / performance.<br>
3<br><br>
A farther object of the present Invention is directed to a system for required flow feeding<br>
of grease in roll bearing and the like which would an one hand ensure exact feeding of<br>
required amourt of grease in the bearing and on the other hand take care that there is<br>
less contamination carried into the bearing while introduction of grease in the bearings<br>
to thereby further ensure effective life and performance of the work roll bearings.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Thus according to the basic aspect of the present invention there is provided a system<br>
for required controlled flow feeding of grease in work roll bearings comprising:<br>
	a dose feeder means adapted to feed said desired selective amounts of grease in<br>
	bearings;<br>
	means to operate the dose feeder means at high pressure to ensure uniform<br>
	distribution of grease inside the bearing; and<br>
	monitoring device adapted to monitor the exact amount of grease feeding through<br>
	the said dose feeders.<br>
	Preferably, in the above system of the invention the said dose feeder means<br>
	comprise plurality of dose feeders adapted to discharge a measured amount of<br>
	grease by every selective operation of the plunger means in the respective dose<br>
	feeders.<br>
	In accordance with a preferred aspect the system comprises plurality of dose feeders<br>
	preferably five dose feeders operable in tandern to plunge grease into the bearings<br>
	preferably through filter means to filter the grease fed into the bearings. Switching<br>
	means are adapted to control on and off of the respective dose feeders preferably<br>
	with equal amount of grease supplied form each of said dose feeders. A mechanical<br>
	counter with digital display means is adapted to record and display the dose amount<br>
	of grease through the dose feeder means. The system is adapted such that the<br>
	feeding operation cycle can be selectively completed in a desired time frame.<br>
	A system as claimed in anyone of claims 2 to 5 comprising flexible hose/pipe means<br>
	operatively connecting the dose feeders to the bearing.<br>
	A grease transfer pump is provided to transfer grease from a grease drum/source to<br>
	a pumping station with dose feeders provided downstream of the pumping station.<br>
	Preferably, a double acting reciprocating grease pump.<br>
4<br><br>
	In accordance with another aspect of the invention the system for required controlled<br>
	feeding of grease in bearings comprise selectively of automatic timer to switch off the<br>
	pump motor after feeding the desired amount of grease into the work roll bearings<br>
	and sound alarm means /hooter with limit switch to indicate low and high levels of<br>
	grease stored in the container mounted on a grease pump to facilitate grease<br>
	transfer.<br>
The above system of the invention would favour a simple yet effective manner of<br>
controlled feeding of exact amount of grease in roll bearings.<br>
It is thus possible by way of the above disclosed system for feedrng grease in work roll<br>
bearings to ensure exact amount of required flow feeding of grease in the work roll<br>
bearing. In particular, the monitoring device ensures continuous meter feeding of the<br>
grease into the bearing which in turn is directed to increase the life of the anti-friction<br>
bearing.<br>
Importantly, in accordance with an aspect of the invention the system for feeding exact<br>
amount of grease in the bearing includes means for pumping grease at high pressure<br>
such that uniform distribution of grease inside the bearing takes place. The system is<br>
therefore user friendly and requires less workload for the maintenance personnel in the<br>
shop floor.<br>
The system of the invention preferably involves a double acting reciprocating grease<br>
pump in place of low pressure high discharge gear pump to feed the desired amount of<br>
grease in the work roll bearing.<br>
The system selectively includes the dose feeding means/dose feeders which are<br>
introduced downstream of the pumping station to feed exact amount of grease in the<br>
bearings mounted on the roll choke assembly. A measured amount of grease is<br>
discharged every time through the plunger of dose feeder. The flow of grease into the<br>
bearing can be further controlled through switching on or off any of the dose feeder.<br>
Equal amount of grease is supplied from each of the feeders. Pipe lines are adapted to<br>
take care of flow of grease into the bearing through the double acting grease flow pump.<br>
In accordance with the further aspect of the invention the system for required controlled<br>
flow feeding of grease in work roll bearing further indudes automatised flow<br>
controlmetering of the grease white feeding to the bearings. Preferably, the system<br>
involves automatic timer to switch off the pump motor after feeding of the desired<br>
amount of grease in the bearing. Importantly also the system is further adapted to<br>
Include sound alarm system (hooter) with limit switches to indicate low and high level of<br><br>
5<br><br>
grease stored in the container mounted on the grease pump to facilitate the grease<br>
transfer. The grease transfer pump is thus adapted to achieve controlled transfer grease<br>
from the grease drum to the pumping station. A mechanical counter with digital display<br>
unit further facilitates the system to calculate the amount of grease being dosed into the<br>
bearing.<br>
The pipeline provided in the system can preferably be a metallic pipeline to deliver<br>
grease in place of flexible high -pressured hose so that the pressure loss is minimum.<br>
Such mettalic pipeline will lead to reduce working pressure generation at the grease<br>
station and consequently lead to a longer life of grease pumps and pipelines.<br>
The details of the invention, its object and advantageous are explained hereunder in<br>
greater detail in relation to non-limiting exemplary illustration of the system for grease<br>
flow feeding of bearings of the invention as per the following accompanying figures.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING FIGURE<br>
Figure 1: is a schematic diagram illustrating the system of grease flow feeding of bearing<br>
in accordance with the invention ; and<br>
Figure 2: is a schematic diagram of the grease pump of the level control<br>
As dearty illustrated in figure 1 the system basically involves plurality of dose feeder<br>
means (DS) which are operatively connected to a grease supply source via a pumping<br>
station (PS) and electronic control (EC) which is operatively connected again to the<br>
grease pump with low level control at one end and to pipe / flexible hose (FH)<br>
connecting to the bearing entry (BE) at the other end,<br>
As also illustrated in the figure, the dosed feeders are provided with operative ball valve<br>
conection (BV) metering maniofolds (MM), flexible hose (FH) cnnecting the metering<br>
manifold to the anchor blocks (AB) and the operatively connected barrel nipples (BN),<br>
The pipeline connecting the dose feeder to the pumping station is preferably obtained<br>
from carbon steel pipe as shown in the figure.<br>
The dosed feedere (OF) as shown are introduced in the downstream of the pumping<br>
station (PS) to feed exact amount of grease in the bearings mounted on the roll-chocked<br>
assembly. The pipelines are thus adapted to take care of the flow of grease into the<br>
bearing through the double acting grease flow pump. A mechanical counter (MC) with<br>
digital display unit is provided to calculate the amount of grease being dosed into<br>
bearing.<br>
6<br><br>
Preferably, a measured amount of grease (90cc) is discharged every time through the<br>
plunger of dose feeder. As in the illustrative embodiment, five sets of dose feeders are<br>
put in tandem to plunge grease into the bearings The flow of grease into the bearing<br>
can be controlled through switching on or off any of the dose feeder with equal amount<br>
of grease being supplied from each feeder, Pneferably, the amount of grease dosed is<br>
displayed in a digrtal display such that any human error could be completely eliminated.<br>
In accordance with the further aspect of the invention, the grease led into the bearing<br>
prior to its entry into the bearing is passed through a filter so that the contamination of<br>
the grease can be controlled and favour avoiding bearing failure.<br>
Reference is now invited to accompanying figure 2 which illustrates the provision of the<br>
grease pump (GP) with level controlled means. As shown in the figure the system is<br>
provided with the grease pump with level controlled indicator which is operatively<br>
connected to reverse valve (RV) to ensure proper indication in case of low level of grease<br>
avalable for feeding. An electronic controlled panel (ECP) can advantageously favour<br>
monitoring the grease pump operation in relation to the lavel controlled by the system.<br>
It is thus possible by way of the system for required controlled feeding of grease in<br>
bearing to reduce bearing failures and in turn also increase the productivity of the plant.<br>
The grease feeding system of the invention would thus enable feeding exact amount of<br>
the grease into the bearings involving the dose feeder with metering manifolds and the<br>
operation at high pressure which ensure that a particular amount of grease is uniformly<br>
fed through the opening of the feeder. The feeding operation cycle using the system can<br>
thus completed in a time frame. The system also enables the operator to know the<br>
amount of grease being fed in individual bearings.<br>
It is tims possible by way of the present system of feeding grease in work roll bearings<br>
before mounting rolls in the mills with required amount of grease in its bearings.<br>
importantly, the system would favour wide state and effective high productivity<br>
operation of work roll bearings and can be advantageously utitized to feed grease in roll<br>
choke bearings in other rolling mill areas, such as, finishing strands in hot strip milt,<br>
skelp untill and the like.<br>
