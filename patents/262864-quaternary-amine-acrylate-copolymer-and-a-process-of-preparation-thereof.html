				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to quaternary amine acrylate based contact killing antimicrobial copolymers with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity without releasing any bioactive agents and can be used for wide number of applications<br>
Background and prior art<br>
Disinfection of drinking water continues to be a challenging problem and more so in a developing and over-populated country like India, where majority of population resides m rural and slum areas and do not have access to safe potable drinking water The efficacy of many of the disinfection systems is still based on actual release of bioactive agents like iodine, chlorine, silver etc in drinking water Physiological effects due to long-term ingestion of bioactive agents, even though at ppm levels, could be an issue Hence, feasibility of incorporating the bioactive agents permanently in the system for killing bacteria on contact without releasing bioactive agents in water will be the best approach There is a keen interest m materials capable of killing harmful microorganisms Such materials could be used to coat the surfaces of common objects touched by people in everyday life (eg door knobs, children's toys, computer keyboards) to render them antiseptic and unable to transmit bacterial infections Hence materials can be impregnated with antimicrobial agents such as antibiotics, quaternary ammonium compounds, silver ions or lodme that are released gradually into the surrounding solution over time and kill microorganisms therem Although these strategies have verified in aqueous solution containing bacteria, they would not expected to be effective against airborne bacteria in the absence of a liquid medium, this situation is especially true for release - based materials which are also liable to become impotent when the leaching antibacterial is exhausted<br>
Quaternary amine acrylate (QAA) have a large variety of usage areas from cosmetics to clothes softeners but especially they are known to be good disinfectants Quaternary amine acrylate's antibacterial ability is resulted from their amphillic structure and surfactant property, which was first reported by Dogmak The antimicrobial action of the<br>
AA is based on theu damaging surfactant like interaction with the membrane (cytoplasmic) of bacteria resulting the loss of the membrane permeability At convenient concentrations, they can cause cell leakage and the death of the cell Quaternary structures are effective on both gram positive and gram-negative bacteria, but they have a stronger antibacterial effect on positive once, since gram negatives have an extra protective membrane Quaternary compounds are widely used because of their non-toxic and non-lrritant property QAA are not affected from the protein concentration of the environment and don't loose their affectivity on bacteria over the course of tune The effectiveness of the agent against microorganisms is directly related to its area of contact with the microorganism's medium<br>
A new concept of contact type of disinfection by iodine based resm formed by adsorption of iodine on a strong alkaline amon-exchange resin has been patented by Liwang He claimed that lodme resin could remove and kill more than 99 9% of E coh, S aureus and C albicans in water at 25°C and pH 6 5 Another Quaternary ammonium exchange resm binding tri-iodide or penta iodide was reported for their ability to disinfect water containing L pneumophile Results mdicated that the lodmated resms are stable demand release disinfectants There was no residual iodine detected by amperometric titration When an aqueous suspension containing 2 7xl09 cfu of L pneumophile per ml was passed through tn-iodinated resins less than 0 004% were recovered No viable cells were detected by direct platmg from a suspension of 2 3 X109 cfu per ml eluted through penta-lodmated resins (&gt;99 999% reduction m viability) but, bactericidal active agents concentration decreases with time Another researcher Ranuci et al synthesized new polymeric disulphides containing t-amino groups m their main chain They were prepared by polyoxidauon of 3,6-dimethyl-3,6-diazoctane-l,8 dithiol and 3,10-dimethyl 3,10-diazadodecane-l,12-dinol respectively They were then quaterrused with methyl iodide and benzyl bromide and the resulting quaternary ammonium polymers were preliminary tested for antimicrobial activity against E coh, P aeruginosa and S aureus Groups like thiocyanates have also been tried to covalently immobilized on a biomaterial surface by Nirmala etal in presence of a phase transfer catalyst in aqueous media leadmg<br>
to the nucleophilic substitution of chlorine by thiocyanates on the PVC surface It was found that the thiocyanate groups have bactericidal properties and remains effective against S aureus and S epidermis even after immobilization on PVC surface Similarly Tiller etal synthesized poly(4-vinyl-N-alkylpyridiruum bromide) which was covalently attached to glass slides to create a surface that kills airborne bacteria on contact The antibacterial properties were assessed by spraying aqueous suspension of bacterial cells on the surface followed by air drying and counting the number of cells remaining viable cells Recently Lee etal reported a permanent, non-leaching antibacterial surface which they have grown directly on the surfaces of glass and paper using atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP)<br>
But above mentioned modified surface were found to loose properties with time because of less extent of quatermsation and also due to surface erosion<br>
The prior arts WO9940791, US6264936, US6126931, US5575917, WO03064412, US2004062744, WO0185813, US6039940, US6448305 and WO0228927 describe contact killing polymer, but there polymers have the limitation of surface modification and they require higher contact time to kill bacteria completely and the surface loose its activity because of erosion of surface active polymeric layer<br>
Object of the invention<br>
The primary objective of the present invention is to develop a polymer with a antimicrobial property<br>
Another object of the invention is to develop quaternary amine acrylate based non-brittle hydrophilic and flexible copolymeric systems with broad spectrum of antimicrobial activities by contact killing in few minutes without releasing any bioactive agents<br>

Yet another object of the present invention is to provide material, which gets easily integrated into conventional equipments and devices<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to obtain the product, which imparts no residual odor and undesirable taste when used for water disinfection application<br>
Further object of the present invention is to develop a system where no sophisticated instrumentation or control is required while handling it<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
