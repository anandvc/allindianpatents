				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates to a process for the continuous synthesis of porous nano-<br>
structured alumina powder.<br>
This invention further relates to a process for the continuous synthesis of hollow,<br>
porous nano-structured alumina powder, by wet chemical processing techniques,<br>
following a spray pyrolysls reaction using defined liquid precursors.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The alumina powders have applications In areas covering ceramics, metallurgy,<br>
polymers, composites, paints, precision polishing, additives, fillers etc. and in<br>
allied area.<br>
Aluminum oxide (alumina) is a ceramic material that finds diverse applications<br>
due to its extraordinary physical, chemical, mechanical properties. There are<br>
more than fifteen distinct crystallographic modifications of alumina. The alpha<br>
modification is its stable form and is widely used as a chief raw material for most<br>
engineering applications. The superior properties of alpha alumina and Its<br>
numerous compositions that can be achieved are high mechanical strength, wear<br>
resistance, corrosion resistance, capability to withstand high temperature and<br>
thermal stresses, high electrical insulation and improved dielectric properties. On<br>
the other hand, thermodynamic unstable forms of alumina are called<br>
transition alumina and are largely used as catalyst carriers (support), bi<br>
functional carriers (serves as support and also contribute to the catalytic<br>
performance), various kinds of fillers, modifiers (for modifying Theological<br><br>
properties), adsorbents, porous filters (membranes for separation) etc. either in<br>
monolith form or Its pelleted form. The physical properties like, particle size (both<br>
primary particle and agglomerate size), morphology, tap density, specific surface<br>
area etc of either form of alumina powders, whether stable or unstable, could be<br>
tailor-made besides maintaining the Tevet of chemical purity in the powder.<br>
Conventionally, thermal dehydration of aluminum hydroxides (depending on<br>
hydroxide modification i.e., bayrlte, gibbsite or boehmtte) produce different low<br>
temperature modifications e.g., chi, eta, rho, gamma (250°C - 900°C) and delta,<br>
kappa, theta alumina in the high temperature range (900°C - 1150°C). These<br>
Intermediate phases of alumina In the above two temperature ranges are many<br>
times collectively called as 'transition alumina' and industrial production of<br>
transition alumina by thermal dehydration of aluminum hydroxides is well known.<br>
As the free energy separations of those low temperature forms of alumina are<br>
close and thus synthesis conditions plays crucial role when a particular phase In<br>
purer form (free from other phases) is attempted to synthesize. As the alpha<br>
modification is the thermodynamic phase in the alumina system, ail the transition<br>
phases of alumina ultimately stabilize to alpha phase at higher temperatures.<br>
There are numerous examples of producing transition alumina using different wet<br>
chemical methods. Among the precipitation routes, precipitation of aluminum<br>
hydroxides as bohemlte using common sources of aluminum salts like nitrates<br>
and sulfates as the mother liquors and liquor ammonia as the precipitating agent<br>
is well evident. In this process, after the precipitation reaction is over, the<br>
precipitates are thoroughly washed in order to remove the adsorbed anionic or<br>
molecular species from the precipitates and then the precipitates are calcined in<br>
air at a given temperature for promoting first dehydration and then crystallization<br>
Into gamma alumina phase or other transition alumina phase/s.<br><br>
Among numerous wet chemical methods, MacKenzle, K.J.D., et at, investigated<br>
preparation of transition alumina by thermal dehydration of mechanically<br>
activated gibbsite, Gibbsite is also used by Mista, W, et al, for the preparation of<br>
transition alumina by flash calcination method, in a sol-gel process, attempts<br>
have been made by Varma H.K., et al, to spray dry the bohemite sols so as to<br>
avoid the agglomeration during the gelation step, The spray dried sols were then<br>
calcined for the preparation of gamma alumina powder, interestingly, spray<br>
pyrorysis of aluminum salts like aluminum sulfate is also evident for synthesizing<br>
gamma alumina powder. Suh, D.J. et al, investigated a fast sol-gel route to<br>
prepare high surface area gamma alumina powders via a precursor so-called<br>
alumina aerogels. Another technique for the preparation of gamma alumina<br>
powders by the hydrolysis of aluminum (rlisoproxide under (he of power<br>
ultrasound (100 W/cm2) in presence of formic acid or oxalic acid as peptizers,<br>
investigated by Ramesh S , et al, Synthesis of nanophase gamma alumina<br>
powder using electron beam heating to vaporize materials in inert or reactive<br>
environments has also been tried by Eastman J.A., et al. and named as electron<br>
beam evaporation method. The relationship between the imperfection structure<br>
of gamma alumina that is formed by dehydration of boehmlte and the<br>
dehydration temperatures is established by Jlan-MIn H , by analyzing the integral<br>
width of X-ray reflections.<br>
Korean patent publication number 2000040938, in July 2000, describes a<br>
production process of gamma alumina powder that comprises several steps,<br>
starting from kaolinite, which is reacted with sulphuric acid prior heating it in the<br>
temperature range 800°C - 900°C and then the resultant solution Is filtered to<br>
remove impurities which is subsequently purified as hydrous aluminum sulphate<br>
by crystallization process and finally the crystals were heat treated m the<br><br>
temperature range 900°C - 1000°C to produce gamma alumina. Chiense patent<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Thus according to this invention is provided a process for the continuous<br>
synthesis of nanostructured alumina powder comprising mixing a solution of an<br>
aluminium salt and amino acid to form a precursor solution, spraying the<br>
precursor solution as fine droplets into a hot chamber to generate precursor<br>
dropfets and simultaneously with hot air, foliowed .by dehydration and<br>
decomposition of the precursor droplets to yield a-powder and calcination of the<br>
powder to yield nano-structured alumina powder.<br>
In accordance with this invention is disclosed a method for the production of<br>
porous, nanostructured alumina powders with hollow and nearly spherical<br>
morphology following a spray pyrorysis reaction technique using defined<br>
aqueous-based liquid precursor. Fig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of a spray<br>
pyrorysis machine which in.-house fabricated. The technical features and design<br>
of such a machine could vary from case to case.. The precursor solution is fed<br>
through the feed inlet (1) provided with valve Vi and the compressed air through<br><br>
air inlet (2) provided with valve V provided with valve of a two fluid nozzle gun<br>
(3) attached with the spray pyrolysis machine and furnished with a deblocking pin<br>
(4). Hydrated aluminum nitrate (solid) and aminoacetic acid (solid, glycine) are<br>
dissolved together in de-ionized/distilied water by maintaining the solution<br>
concentration in the range of 0.1 - 1 kg/liter and 'glycine - nitrate' molar ratio in<br>
the range 0.08 - 0.15. The resultant solution/s is then termed as 'liquid<br>
precursor'. In general, the production process starts with spraying off the liquid<br>
precursor along with air/compressed air using a two-fluid nozzle gun (3)<br>
(diameter of the nozzle orifice and also number of cavities of the spray gun may<br>
vary) attached with the spray pyrolysis machine, thereby generating Tine<br>
droplets' of the liquid precursor. Other gases like pure oxygen, enriched oxygen<br>
etc can also be used as the counter fluid here. The process of generating fine<br>
droplets from its liquid precursor is often popularly called as atomization process,<br>
though there is no actual atomization, The fineness of the precursor droplets<br>
depends both on the diameter of the orifice of the nozzle through which it is<br>
sprayed and also on the pressure level of the compressed air used in the two-<br>
fluid gun (3). The resultant fine droplets are then allowed to pass in the pre-<br>
heated reaction chamber (5) of the spray pyrolysis machine wherein the<br>
precursor droplets come in contact with hot air (H), which was made to blow in<br>
from outside by a blower (7) and passes through electricalry heated coils or gas<br>
heating system (6), attached with the spray pyrolysis machine.<br>
The temperature of the reaction chamber is maintained by controlling the<br>
temperature of the hot air and also the blower speed The design of the reaction<br>
chamber (5) as well as the temperature profile in various reaction zone/s therein<br>
may vary from case to case. In principle, the dehydration reaction of the<br>
precursor droplets occurs in the dehydration zone (8) of the reaction chamber<br>
and this step requires maximum energy (endothermic reaction) as compared to<br>
the resi of the steps in the course of synthesis. So, the hottest zone (or<br>
maximum heat flow region) in a given temperature profile of 100° - 480°C in the<br>
reactor need to kept for dehydration step for the yield of dehydrated precursors<br><br>
under a given feed rate efficiently. When the feed rate is increased, a counter<br>
amount of heat supply is to be maintained so as to maintain the minimum<br>
temperature required dehydrating the increased flow of precursor droplets<br>
effectively and efficiently in this zone (8), On the other hand, if the heat flow is not<br>
counter balanced with the increased flow of the precursor in the dehydrating<br>
zone (8), liquid precursor will escape in the succeeding reaction zone i,e, the<br>
decomposition zone (9) resulting in incomplete dehydration. The next step of<br>
chemical reaction is the decomposition reaction of the freshly-formed dehydrated<br>
precursors, which takes place in the decomposition zone (9). Although this is an<br>
exothermic reaction, it requires a minimum temperature of 250°C so as to carry<br>
out the decomposition reaction completely under a given feed rate of precursor<br>
droplets. As in the previous zone, in this zone too, when the feed rate is<br>
increased, a counter amount of heat supply is to be maintained so as to maintain<br>
the minimum temperature in this zone (9) as well. The last step is the formation<br>
of said alumina powders from the decomposed precursors In the powder<br>
formation zone (10). This powder needs to be made free from the decomposed<br>
gases and moisture prior to segregating them by a cyclone separator (11)<br>
attached with the spray pyrolysls machine with respect to Its coarse to finer<br>
fraction In this zone, maintenance of a minimum temperature of 100°C is<br>
essential, since the powders are susceptible to absorb moisture and other gases<br>
due to Its hollow and porous morphology. A low temperature (
zone could result in accumulation of moisture and other gases with the said<br>
alumina powders resulting the powders heavier. So, as the chemical reaction<br>
proceeds starting dehydration, to decomposition and finally the generation of the<br>
moisture-free dry powders at the end, there is a fall in temperature in the reaction<br>
chamber in the above sequence of reaction. This gives the technical guideline to<br>
design the reactor suitably along with the direction of the heat flow and thus the<br>
maintenance of temperature In different reaction zones therein. The temperature<br>
profile in each reaction zone in the chamber was measured by inserting<br>
appropriate thermocouples (12a-d) that was built-in in the spray pyrohysis<br><br>
machine during its fabrication. The coarse powders (13) produced in the reaction<br>
chamber (5) are collected by gravity container (14) which may be made of<br>
borosiiicate glass. The finer fraction of the powders (15) are segregated by a<br>
cyclone separator (11) attached with the spray pyrolysis machine and collected<br>
separately in container/s (16) outside the reaction chamber (5) and the<br>
decomposed gases are sent out through gas outlet (17) water-immersed<br>
porcelain beads (18) in the water injection cum exhaust chamber (19), Water<br>
circulation in the exhaust chamber (19) is maintained by water entering in<br>
through the inlet (20) and exiting through outlet (21). The yield of finer fraction is<br>
always more than its counter coarse fraction irrespective of feed rate and<br>
concentration of the precursor and hence the finer fraction Is considered for al!<br>
analysis and further applications. However, when the diameter of the nozzle<br>
orifice of the spray gun is relatively big coupled with low air pressure level in the<br>
counter fluid, the size of precursor droplet increases for which the yield of coarse<br>
fraction will be higher.<br>
The resultant powders (finer fraction) are caiied porous, nanostructured alumina<br>
powders that showed a tap density in the range of 0.04 - 0.08 g/cc, amorphous<br>
structure in the XRD and hollow and nearly spherical morphology In the SEM<br>
respectively. The size of these hollow-sphere particles depends on the.droplet<br>
size of the precursor feed (with a given precursor concentration) that has been,<br>
generated by a two-fluid spray gun In the spray pyrolysis machine using<br>
air/compressed air as the counter fluid. Thus, the droplet size of the precursor is<br>
depended both on the i) diameter of the orifice and if) air pressure in the two-fluid<br>
spray gun in spray pyrolysis machine. Lower diameter of the orifice coupled with<br>
higher air pressure increases the fineness of the droplet see and vice versa,<br>
The as-derived powders when heat-treated (calcination) In presence of air at<br>
different temperature/s in the range of 300o - 10000C with a definite period of<br><br>
soaking time at the calcination temperature, the specific surface area and the<br>
crystalinity into gamma alumina phase of the powders increases as a function of<br>
calcination temperature. The specific surface area of the derived powders<br>
however decreases beyond a calcination temperature of 1000°C by converting<br>
the powder into alpha alumina phase.<br>
The feed concentration of the precursor (under a given feed rate) has an<br>
Influence on the yield of the powder. As a thumb rule, higher the concentration of<br>
the precursor, higher is the yield, though the powders derived using higher<br>
concentration of the precursor shows higher tap density and relatively low<br>
specific surface area. Higher concentration of the precursor also tends to<br>
increase the coarse fraction of the powders. Morphology of the powders in the<br>
SEM as well as the amorphous nature in the XRD does not however change with<br>
the change in concentration of the precursor.<br>
As mentioned before, feed concentration is fixed \n the range of 0.1 - 1.0 kg/liter.<br>
Any higher concentration of 1.0 kg/liter makes the dissolution of the two reactants<br>
i.e., aluminum nitrate and glycine difficult at ambient temperature in the range of<br>
20° - 35°C. On the other hand, any concentration lower than 0.1 kg/liter of the<br>
precursor reduces the yield of the powder. Hence, an optimum range of<br>
precursor concentration as mentioned in the above was preferred.<br>
Yield of the powders under a given concentration of the precursor is also<br>
dependant on the feed rate. As a thumb rule, higher the feed rate, higher would<br>
be the yield. However, as the feed rate increases, enough heat supply into the<br>
reaction chamber need to be maintained in order to ensure a counter water<br>
evaporation rate from the precursor. This is to avoid the generation of<br><br>
uivdecomposed precursor mass in the reaction chamber, which would otherwise<br>
result in hard solid or semi-solid lumps in stead of yielding the said powder. It is<br>
for this that it i$ important to maintain proper heat supply in the reaction chamber<br>
with the maintenance of reaction temperature/s in different stages, which is good<br>
enough for conducting complete reaction. Any higher temperature than its<br>
specified levels in the reaction zones in the chamber improves the production<br>
rate and the yield<br>
The anionic ratio of the precursor i.e., 'glycine - nitrate' molar ratio is one of the<br>
important aspect of the process which is normally kept in the range of 0.08 -<br>
0.15. A ratio below 0.08 would not be able to convert the precursor into<br>
decomposed product effectively and efficiently at the minimum specified<br>
temperature of decomposition. Whereas, a ratio above 0.15 will cause carbon<br>
or carbonaceous product impurities in the decomposed product i.e., alumina.<br>
The scientific principle involved In the decomposition reaction here is a kind of<br>
thermally-induced redox reaction between the anions present in the precursors<br>
i.e., glycine and nitrate in this case, in which nitrate acts as an oxidant and<br>
glycine as a reductant. The anionic molar ratio in the precursor beyond 0.15, the<br>
resultant decomposed product needs to be calcined separately at a higher<br>
temperature in order to make the powder free from un-decomposed carbon or<br>
carbonaceous matters.<br>
The invention will now be explained in greater details with the help of the<br>
following non-limiting examples.<br><br>
Example 1:<br><br>
Aluminum nitrate nano hydrate (solid) and aminoacetic acid (glycine, solid) were<br>
dissolved together in de-ionized water by maintaining a concentration of 1 kg/liter<br>
and 'glycine-nltrate' molar ratio of 0 1 and thus an aqueous solution was<br>
prepared, which is termed as liquid precursor', The liquid precursor (feed rate of<br>
4.0 liters/hour) was sprayed off along with compressed air (pressure level of 3.5<br>
kg/cm2) using a two-fluid nozzle (nozzle orifice diameter 0.5 mm) gun attached<br>
with the spray pyrolysis machine, thereby generated fine 'precursor droplets'. A<br>
schematic diagram of the spray pyrolysis machine is furnished in the Diagram 1,<br>
though the technical features and design of such a machine could vary from case<br>
to case. The resultant precursor dropiets were then aiiowed io get mixed with<br>
hot air in a pre-heated reaction chamber of the spray pyrolysis machine in which<br>
the temperature of dehydration zone, decomposition zone and the bottom zone<br>
were kept at around 450°C, 250°C and tfO°C respectively with a variation of<br>
temperature in each zone within +/- 10°C, The precursor dropiets when came in<br>
contact with hot air that was blown in from outside the reaction chamber slowly<br>
moves from one reaction zone (higher temperature) to another (lower<br>
temperature) vertically down in the reaction chamber following dehydration to<br>
decomposition reaction and finally the formation of moisture-free porous alumina<br>
powders at the end. The coarse powder was collected through gravity in a<br>
borosiilcate glass outside the reaction chamber. A cyclone separator that Is<br>
attached with the spray pyrolysis machine fractionated the finer fraction of the<br>
powders and were collected separately in glass containers outside the reaction<br>
chamber.<br><br>
Finer fraction of the derived powder showed a tap density of ~ 0.04 g/cc and also<br>
showed amorphous structure in the XRD Figure 2 shows the general<br>
morphology of the derived powders in the SEWT, whereas Figure 3 shows the<br>
same in a magnified view. Figure 4 shows the morphology of an identified single<br>
particle that has net-shaped spherical morphology, whereas Figure 5 shows the<br>
morphology of a nearly spherical hollow particle, Figure 6 shows the nano-<br>
structure of the shell wall of the particles in the SEM. Figure 7 and Figure 8 show<br>
how the crystallinity into gamma alumina phase and specific surface area of the<br>
powders of the powders changes a function of temperature<br>
Example 2.<br><br>
Aluminum nitrate nano hydrate (solid) and glycine (solid) were dissolved together<br>
in de-ionized water at a concentration of 0.7 kg/liter and by maintaining 'glycine-<br>
nitrate* molar ratio at 0.15 and thus an aqueous solution was prepared, which Is<br>
termed as 'liquid precursor'. The liquid precursor was sprayed off (feed rate of<br>
5.0 liters/hour) along with compressed air (pressure level of 4.0 kg/cm2) using a<br>
two-fluid nozzle (nozzle orifice diameter 0.5 mm) gun attached with the spray<br>
pyrofysis machine, thereby generated fine 'precursor droplets'. The resultant<br>
precursor droplets were then allowed to get mixed with hot air in a pre-heated<br>
reaction chamber of the spray pyrolysis machine in which the temperature of<br>
dehydration zone, decomposition zone and the bottom zone were kept at around<br>
470°C, 280UC and 120°C respectively with a variation of temperature in each<br>
zone within +/- 10°C. The precursor droplets when came in contact with hot air<br>
that was blown In from outside the reaction chamber slowly moves from one<br>
reaction zone (higher temperature) to another (lower temperature zone) vertically<br>
down to the reaction chamber following dehydration, decomposition reaction and<br><br>
finally, the formation of moisture-free alumina powders at the end. The coarse<br>
powder was collected through gravity in a borosllicaie glass outside the reaction<br>
chamber, A cyclone separator that is attached with the spray pyrolysis machine<br>
fractionated the finer fraction of the powders and were collected separately in<br>
glass containers outside the reaction chamber.<br>
Finer fraction of the derived powder showed a tap density of 0.45 g/cc and also<br>
showed amorphous structure in the XRD. The morphology of the finer fraction of<br>
the derived powders showed similar to that in the example 1. The specific<br>
surface area and crystallinity into gamma alumina phase of the powders also<br>
showed similar trends to that of the Example 1.<br>
Example 3:<br><br>
Aluminum nitrate nano hydrate (solid) and glycine (solid) were dissolved together<br>
in de-ionized water at a concentration of 0,3 kg/liter and by maintaining 'glyeine-<br>
nitrafe' moiar ratio at 0,12 and thus an aqueous solution was prepared, which is<br>
termed as 'liquid precursor'. The liquid precursor was sprayed off (feed rate of<br>
6.0 liter/hour) along with compressed air (pressure ievei of 4 kg/cm2) using a two-<br>
fluid nozzle (nozzle orifice diameter 0.7 mm) gun attached with the spray<br>
pyrolysis machine, thereby generated fine 'precursor droplets'. The resultant<br>
precursor droplets were then allowed to get mixed with hot air In a pre-heated<br>
reaction chamber of the spray pyrolysis machine in which the temperature of<br>
dehydration zone, decomposition zone and the bottom zone were kept at around<br>
480°C, 260°C and 120°C respectively with a variation of temperature in each<br>
zone within +/- 10°C. The precursor droplets when came in contact with hot air<br>
that was blown in from outside the reaction chamber slowly moves from one<br><br>
temperature to another temperature zone vertically in the reaction chamber<br>
following dehydration, decomposition reaction and finally, the formation of the<br>
powders at the end. The coarse powder was collected through gravity in a<br>
borosilicate glass outside the reaction chamber. A cyclone separator that is<br>
attached with the spray pyrorysis machine fractionated the finer fraction of the<br>
powders and were collected separately in glass containers outside the reaction<br>
chamber.<br>
Finer fraction of the derived powder showed a tap density of 0.05 g/cc and also<br>
showed amorphous structure in the XRD. SEM micrographs of the powders<br>
showed marginally bigger size of the hollow spheres. The specific surface area<br>
and crystaiiinity into gamma aiumma phase of the powders showed similar trend<br>
to that of the example 1.<br>
Example 4:<br>
The porous alumina powders derived in the 'Example 1' were subjected to heat<br>
treatment at different set temperatures In the range of 300° - 1000°C In air with a<br>
fixed soaking time of one hour at the calcination temperature The heating rate<br>
was fixed at 1°/min to that of the set temperature. The crysfalinrty and specific<br>
surface area of resultant calcined powders were examined by X-ray powder<br>
diffraction (Cu-Ka radiation) and BET (liquid nitrogen as absorbing media)<br>
methods. Figure 7 shows how the gamma alumina phase develops as a function<br>
calcination temperature of the powders Figure 8 explains the increase in<br>
specific surface area as a function of calcination temperature. Morphology of the<br>
powders however remains similar as a function of calcination temperature,<br><br>
though some particles strated to become flaky-type towards the higher<br>
calcination temperatures (beyond 800°C). The increase in specific surface area<br>
as a function of temperature is believed to be because of phase transition into<br>
gamma alumina phase. The powder when calcined beyond a temperature of<br>
10000C was converted into alpha alumina phase and specific surface area of the<br>
powder decreased as well<br><br>
