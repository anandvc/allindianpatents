				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a simplified door for automobiles of the type which are based on an assembly formed by an external reinforcing panel, a frame and an internal panel of the door casing, connected to rein¬forcing and sealing units, that in general terms create one unit.<br>
In known units of this type, the internal panel of the door casing traditionally receives the majority of the parts incorporated into the door on both sides of the vehicle, left and right, so that depending on the side in question, one panel is made for one side and another panel for the other side.<br>
This method of proceeding has the disadvantage of a considerable cost in both storage and transport of the different components, as well as in other stages in the life of the assembly, such as during manufacture or in repair.<br>
In the same way, the assembly of the components presents additional disadvantages, since it is necessa¬ry to fit each of them into its corresponding panel.<br>
One object of this invention is to provide a sim¬plified door for automobiles that avoids all these di¬sadvantages .<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a simplified door for automobiles that allows the same parts to be used in both doors.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a simplified door for automobiles that can be used in frameless doors, in which all the parts are applicable<br>
on both sides.<br>
Accordingly the present invention relates to a Simplified door for automobiles, with a door casing and with the corresponding sealing and reinforcing items, which is characterised in that it is formed starting from an external panel and an internal panel of the door casing between which a frame is situated, in that the internal panel of the door casing is made symmetrically in relation to a symmetry axis, with the majority of the parts that are incorporated into the door being assembled on its sides, where on the right hand side or on the left hand side, with the internal panel usually being an part with an elongated shape and provided at its longitudinal ends with a set of prolongations with specific shapes and in order to receive the hinges and lock of the door, respectively, as well as another two supplementary parts, a hinge reinforcement and a lock reinforcement that close off these ends, all of which are symmetrical in relation to the previously mentioned symmetry axis.In order to put these objectives into practice, the door in accordance with the invention claims the existence of an external panel with its corresponding reinforcement and a lower seal, all on one side of the door frame, with an internal panel of the door frame with its hinge and lock side reinforcements, an exter¬nal upper reinforcement of the door frame and an inter¬nal upper seal.<br>
The internal panel of the door frame has the par¬ticular characteristic that it is a completely symme¬trical part with regard to its horizontal X-X' axis, above and below it, and its longitudinal ends are sui¬tably shaped so as to receive the hinges on one side and the lock on the other side, with these ends inclu¬ding some formally corresponding reinforcing parts.<br>
One variant of the invention consists of simpli¬fying the internal panel of the door so that a central unit is produced, contained in a single plane, which is symmetrical with regard to a horizontal X-X' axis, abo¬ve and below the said axis, while the two support parts, both for the hinges and for the lock, are fitted to the two longitudinal ends of the said central unit, with the corresponding reinforcements being situated beside the latter.<br>
Both support parts and both reinforcements have the same kind of symmetry as the central part, so that<br>
with this simplification, manufacturing is much easier.<br>
In the same way, the invention claims a door pro¬vided with an external panel with its corresponding<br>
reinforcement, on one side of the frame and a door ca-sing, with its end reinforcement for the hinges and lock and another upper reinforcement.  The longitudinal ends of the door casing are provided with the corresponding shapes in order to receive the hinges and the lock, on which the said reinforcement are arranged.<br>
The characteristic particularity lies in the fact that the door casing is a completely symmetrical part in relation to a central Y-Y' axis, so that the por¬tions situated to the right and to the left of this axis are identical, and are also provided with components in¬corporated into them which are equal.<br>
This characteristic logically extends to the end reinforcements and to the ends of the door casing them¬selves for the fitting of the hinges and lock.<br>
In this kind of door formation, the upper part of the door casing is normally used to hold the upper wea¬ther seals for the window, while this arrangement admits the variant of introducing a holding or support bar into the structure of the door frame for the said upper wea¬ther seals .<br>
Another variant of the invention establishes a noticeable simplification of the assembly, by making the door panel separately from its longitudinal ends that receive the hinges and lock, which are connected later by any means available.<br>
On the accopmanying sheets of drawings, it is possible to appreciate the object of the invention in detail.  In these drawings, which are not restrictive in nature, the following are represented:<br>
-	Figure 1 is a perspective of a door solution in<br>
accordance with the invention.<br>
-	Figure 2 is a perspective of the simplifies va¬<br>
riant, in accordance with the invention.<br>
-	Figure 3 represents the elevation view of the<br>
items that configure the panel, supports, and reinforce¬<br>
ments in Figure 2.<br>
-	Figure 4, is a perspective of the development<br>
of another door, in accordance with the invention.<br>
-	Figure 5 is another variant of the invention.<br>
-	Figure 6 is an enlarged representation of the<br>
internal wall of the casing shown in Figure 4.<br>
-	Figure 7 is a perspective in development of ano¬<br>
ther variant of the invention.<br>
-	Figure 8 is also a perspective of the develop¬<br>
ment of another variant covered by the invention.<br>
With regard to Figure 1, we can appreciate the door assembly made up of the external panel (1) with its- reinforcement (2) and the internal reinforcement (3), all of which are on one side of the frame (9).  On the internal side of the frame, we can observe the in¬ternal panel of the door casing (8) with an upper exter¬nal reinforcement (6) and internal upper seal (7).<br>
The longitudinal ends of this internal panel (8) are suitably shaped in order to receive the hinges at one end (41) and the lock at the other (51), while also<br>
in turn being reinforced by the items (4,5).<br>
This subassembly is perfectly symmetrical in re-lation to the horizontal X-X' axis, so that the two hal-ves situated above and below this axis are established with the different items (12) in the same position and equally separated from this axis.<br>
As regards Figure 2, in this variant we can ob-serve the internal panel of the door casing (11) made in one single continent plane, with the support parts (4',5') for the hinges and locks, respectively, which in turn can later receive the reinforcement, not illus-trated in this perspective.<br>
Like in the case of Figure 1, this subassembly is symmetrical in relation to the horizontal X-X' axis, as are all the items (12) on board it, which are equally separated by the same distance above and below the said axis .<br>
The different components can be joined together by welding, riveting, bolts, adhesives or any other uni¬ting system available, in such a way that, as mentioned previously, the same parts can be used for both right hand and left hand doors.<br>
The different items can be made of different ma¬terials and be of different thicknesses, thus achieving improvements as regards energy absorption (damping) in case of side impacts and a greater control of the rigi¬dity of the structure.<br>
Looking now at Figure 3, we can subassembly shown in Figure 2, with the flat central part (11), the two<br>
end supports (4',5') and their two reinforcements (4,5).<br>
With regard to Figure 4, we can appreciate the ex¬ternal panel (13) with its corresponding reinforcement (14), both parts being on one side of the door frame (19).<br>
On the internal side, we can observe the internal panel of the door casing (18) with its ends (15',16') suitably shaped in order to receive the hinges and lock, respectively, then later receiving the corresponding side reinforcements (15,16) on these ends and also the upper reinforcement of the casing (17).<br>
It can be seen that the panel (18) of the casing is perfectly symmetrical in its geometry in relation to the vertical Y-Y' axis, with this symmetry extending to the side reinforcements (15,16), all of which is carried out in such a way that the halves on both sides of the said axis are, as can be appreciated, suitably symmetri¬cal, as anticipated by the invention.<br>
According to Figure 5, we can appreciate the va¬riant that consists of the placing of the holding bar (20) in the structure of the door frame (13), on which the upper weather seals for the window are fixed, ins¬tead of using the upper part of the casing for this purpose.<br>
This basic characteristic of the invention can be appreciated more clearly in Figure 6, where it is possible to observe the internal panel with the diffe¬rent items (24) to be arranged on it, the ends (15V, 16') and the reinforcements (15,16) for the areas of the hinges and the locks.<br>
In this Figure 6, like in the previous Figures, at least partially, the internal panel (18) of the door ca¬sing has some upper and lower reinforcing areas (23), whose added use will be described later.<br>
In accordance with Figure 7, we emphasise the sim¬plest variant for the door, consisting of situating a more elementary central part (21) than in the previous cases, and connecting the end parts (15", 16") to it in order to receive the hinges and lock and, later, the reinforcements, which are not shown here.<br>
In this case, the panel (21) is provided with a lower horizontal reinforcement (23) which could be eli¬minated if so required, thus making the unit even sim¬pler .<br>
Another variant, shown in Figure 8, has a lower reinforcement (23) of the panel that extends towards the sides of the said panel in the form of prolongations (23A, 23B), capable of later receiving the end parts (15", 16").<br>
Obviously, other types and shapes of variations are possible within the context of the invention, while conserving its basic characteristic.<br>
The different items used in the door can be joined together by welding, rivets, bolts, screws, adhesives or any other means of system of connection available.<br>
The door configuration, exactly as it has been described, can be used in frameless doors, in which all the parts are applicable for both sides.<br><br><br>
