FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a pull through and related methods of manufacture, use and dispensing. In one form such a pull through is a pull through for an endoscopic and a method for manufacturing such apparatus.<br>
Endoscopes require frequent cleaning. It is found that endoscopes (such as those lined with, for example, a polyurethane sleeve) are perhaps best sterilised between uses by a cleaning regime that involves the pushing and/or pulling through of a brush the effect of which is to smooth the inwardly directed surface and surface deposits of the polyurethane sleeve or its equivalent. Apparently this better enables chemical cleaning and sterilisation to ensue. See for example the post Mar. 2, 2000 published content of PCT/AU99/00669 (WO 00/10476) of Novapharm Research (Australia) Pty Limited the full content of which is here included by way of reference.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to any such pull through apparatus, all uses of such apparatus and methods for manufacturing such apparatus.<br>
As used herein the term "pull through" also includes (where the circumstance allows) a "push through" device. Frequently, by way of example, where a short length conduit is to be dealt with, it is sometimes just as convenient to push the head of a pull through type device through the device rather than thread and then pull the pull through device through the short length conduit. Accordingly the term "pull through" in the present specification and in the appended claims includes within its ambit any variant capable in some circumstances of being used as a push through.<br><br>
In a first aspect the invention is a pull through comprising or including a filament having at least a thermoplastics surface, and a moulded thermoplastic mass about said filament defining a pull through profile adapted for the purpose of the pull through, wherein the filament is a monofilament (whether of the one material or otherwise) sufficiently stiff to enable its threading through the member (e.g. endoscope, fuel line, conduit, barrel, etc.) for which it is adapted or intended for use, and wherein said moulded thermoplastic mass is of a material of lower melting point than at least part of said filament.<br>
Preferably said monofilament is of a single plastics material.<br>
Preferably said single plastics material is polypropylene.<br>
Preferably the moulded thermoplastics mass is of polyethylene (e.g.; LLDPE) and a polyolefin elastomer. Examples include SANTOPRENE™, DOWLEX™ and ENGAGE™. Preferably said filament is round in section.<br>

In still a further aspect the present invention consists in use of apparatus in accordance with the present invention to clean an endoscope or endoscopes.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Preferred form of the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which;<br>
FIG. 1 is a reduced view of a preferred form of the present invention having an injection moulded form of said second plastics material at the end of a pull through type filament of said first plastics material, said pull through elongate member being preferably flexible and being able to pull the brush like form of the injection moulded form to achieve a cleaning effect in an appropriately dimensioned endoscope,<br>
FIG. 2 is a cross section along the longitudinal axis of the injection moulded form end of the cleaning apparatus of FIG. 1,<br>
FIG. 3 A, 3B and C show some alternatives to the embodiment of FIG. 2, and<br>
FIG. 4 shows a preferred manufacturing sequence.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
In the preferred form of the present invention the pull through is a cut to length straight and threadable monofilament of a suitable polypropylene. Preferably a tempered extruded<br><br>
polypropylene (e.g.; homopolymer P.P. supplied by Fina Chemicals, Europe or Honam Petrochemical, Korea) that has a CO2 blown section (as a result of there having been foaming agents included with the polypropylene at the extrusion stage thereof) provides the monofilament, such monofilament assuming a substantially round cross section. Whilst coaxially different materials may be used that is not a preferred option and nor is blended material owing to delamination. Delamination problems may be overcome by better compounding prior to extrusion.<br>
PP monofilament produced on single screw extruder 5 zones reverse temperature profile.<br>
Polymer Base—Polypropylene homopolyer MFI3.5<br>
Additives-Hydrocerol foaming agent let down into LDPE base.<br>
Colour fiuoro red let down into LLDPE base/Food contact safe.<br>
Processing Data<br>
Polymer and additives are pre-mixed. Additive percentages are precise.<br>
Processing through the extruder using the correct temperature allows a controlled Carbon Dioxide release in the centre of the extrudate when extruded through the nozzle and exposed to the pressure drop in the atmosphere for a short time before being quenched, extrudate is drawn away fi-om the die nozzle at a precise constant speed before being reheated in hot air.<br>
Once the extrudate has been reheated it is then pulled down many times faster than the extrusion speed thus forming molecular chains which results in the extrudate becoming strong in the longitudinal direction. In doing this, lateral strength is extensively reduced and the extrudate remains stressed. The surface of the extrudate is then heat treated under tension to biaxially orientate the surface molecules of the extrudate before being precision cross wound to a diameter of 130 mm approx on a PVC core. The product is shrink wrapped for transportation and hygiene purposes.<br><br>
The most preferred plastics material is a homopolymer polypropylene supplied by Finapro Chemicals or Honan.<br>
That product with an inclusion of hydrocerol CO2 is extruded to provide a monofilament of density about 0.97. Extruded PP filament tempered at about 130o C is 0.9 mm (±5%) in diameter.<br>
Conditioning<br>
Because the extrudate is packaged hot and stressed, it takes on a very acute memory. Annealing or reheating the extrudate below a temperature less than the softening point of the polymer under light tension allows the molecules in the extrudate to relax thus eliminating the memory.<br>
A consequence of such conditioning is that the product will shrink. The pre-conditioning tunnel is a simple heat tunnel during which the monofilament is drawn under some degree of tension (preferably from 91 to 95o C. (most preferably 93 to 95o C.) for about 12 seconds) so as to achieve an axial extension of no greater than 5% but preferably more than 1% during such conditioning).<br>
The monofilament itself has a pull through head profile of a suitable material injection moulded there around at a temperature not sufficient to melt the monofilament (at least in total) at that point (or those points) and preferably not at all.<br>
Whilst ideally the surface of the polypropylene monofilament has been pre-conditioned at an elevated temperature in order to take away the memory of its spool or coil supply, such preconditioning temperature is sufficient only to soften the outer surface to ensure better keying with the material and not to detract from the prior higher temperature tempering of the monofilament to prevent "fluffiness".<br>
hi the preferred form of the present invention the arrangement is as shown in FIG. 4<br><br>
where the injection moulding is performed using any appropriate injection moulding machine (for example, a BOY™ 22AW) and a cassette or other off take of the output product bundles.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention (much less preferred as less easily threaded and more prone to delamination) the elongate injection molded form 2 may be of a suitable plastics material (such as 50% HOPE and 50% P.E.). Such a HDPE/PP blend has when formed and stretched a uniaxial orientation and at that end of the filament material 1 onto which the injection molded form 2 is injection molded there is a material melting point greater than that of the injection molded form material.<br>
The injection moulded form 2 however is of a thermoplastic capable of being injection moulded. Such materials include a combination of an elastomer and LLDPE and preferably have a melting point below that of the material 1 so as to not destroy the structure of the filament 1 and thus the integrity of the composite device.<br>
In the preferred form of the present invention therefore preferably the monofilament is either a polypropylene or a polypropylene/high density polyethylene mix. The head is preferably a linear low density polyethylene/elastomer mix but alternative could be of elastomer alone, high density polyethylene alone or TPR.<br>
The pull throughs thus made can have the pull through profile of any appropriate form but preferably one that is symmetric about the monofilament into which it is keyed.<br>
To assist such moulded symmetry of the pull through head preferably the waisted region of the filament (see FIG. 2) is support on a pin or the like member in the mould cavity.<br>
Whilst annular flutes or the like can be provided these need not necessarily be present. Moreover for purposes other than endoscope cleaning or smoothing purposes other forms (brush-like or not) can be prepared,<br>
A person skilled in the art will appreciate how (as shown) injection moulded form 2 can<br><br>
be brush like in character (whether having continuous or discontinuous annular ridges or the like being provided to exert a cleaning or smoothing effect).<br>
The dimensions will be as varied as are the dimensions (diameter and length) of, for example, endoscopes.<br>
For usual endoscope purposes an ideal length of a pull through is from 30 to 220 cm with the pull through profile being of a circular cross-section at its maximum dimension with such diameter being in the range of from 0.95 to 4.5 mm.<br>
Other uses to which such pull throughs can be put include the cleaning of fuel lines, the cleaning of firearms, etc.<br>
In use the pull through filament 1 would be inserted into the conduit to be pulled through (e.g. an endoscope, a fuel line, etc.) and thereafter the injection molded form 2 would be pulled through using the filament material 1.<br><br><br>
