				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR REPORTING RECEPTION RATIO<br>
OF STREAMING SERVICE BY TERMINAL IN A MOBILE<br>
BROADCASTING SYSTEM, AND SYSTEM THEREOF<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a method and apparatusfor providing<br>
broadcast services in a broadcasting system and system thereof, and in<br>
particular, to a method and apparatus for reporting a reception ratio of a<br>
streaming service in a broadcasting system and system thereof.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
The broadcasting system, as used herein, refers to a mobile broadcasting<br>
system that provides broadcast services to terminals. The mobile communication<br>
market constantly faces the need for production of new services through<br>
recombination or integration of the existing technologies. Today, due to the<br>
development of communication and broadcast technologies, the conventional<br>
broadcasting system has reached the phase of providing broadcast services<br>
through mobile terminals (hereinafter terminals) such as mobile phones and<br>
Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs). Convergence of mobile communication<br>
service and Internet Protocol (IP) technology is now the mainstream of the next<br>
generation mobile communication technology in harmony with the latent market<br>
needs, the increasing user demand for multimedia services, the strategy of the<br>
service providers for providing new services like the broadcast service in<br>
addition to the existing voice service, and the interests of the Information<br>
Technology (IT) companies that are reinforcing their mobile communication<br>
business to meet the user demands.<br>
Open Mobile Alliance (OMA), which is a group assembled to study the<br>
standard for the inter-working between individual mobile solutions, mainly<br>
handles establishing various application standards for mobile games, Internet<br>
service, and the like. In particular, OMA Browser and Content (BAC) Mobile<br>
Broadcast (BCAST) Sub Working Group, one of the OMA working groups, is<br>
studying the technology that provides broadcast services to mobile terminals.<br><br>
In a mobile broadcasting system being discussed in the OMA BCAST<br>
Working Group, a terminal for receiving a broadcast service should receive<br>
service guide information in which service description information, service<br>
charging information and service reception method information are included,<br>
and the terminal receives a corresponding service using the service guide<br>
information.<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates architecture of a conventional mobile broadcasting<br>
system, and particularly, a logical architecture of each working group in the<br>
BCAST system that establishes standard technologies of an application layer and<br>
its lower transport layer to provide mobile broadcast service.<br>
A detailed description will first be made of logical entities shown in FIG.<br>
1. A Content Creation entity (CC) 101 provides contents, which are the basis of a<br>
BCAST service, and the contents can include a file for a normal broadcast<br>
service, for example, data for movie, audio and video. In addition, the Content<br>
Creation entity 101 provides, to a BCAST Service Application entity 102,<br>
attributes for the contents, provided for generating a service guide and<br>
determining a transport bearer over which the service will be delivered.<br>
The BCAST Service Application entity 102 receives the data for the<br>
BCAST service from the Content Creation entity 101 and processes the received<br>
data in the format suitable for media encoding, content protection and interactive<br>
service. In addition, the BCAST Service Application entity 102 provides the<br>
attributes for the contents provided from the Content Creation entity 101 to a<br>
BCAST Service Distribution/Adaptation entity 103 and a BCAST Subscription<br>
Management entity 104. The BCAST Service Distribution/Adaptation entity 103<br>
performs file/streaming delivery, service collection, service protection, service<br>
guide generation/delivery and service notification operations using the BCAST<br>
service data provided from the BCAST Service Application entity 102. In<br>
addition, the BCAST Service Distribution/Adaptation entity 103 adapts the<br>
service to be suitable for a Broadcast Distribution System (BDS) 112.<br>
The BCAST Subscription Management Entity 104 manages service<br>
provisioning such as a subscription/charging-related function of a BCAST<br>
service user, provisioning of information used for the BCAST service, and a<br><br>
terminal receiving the BCAST service, in a hardware/software manner. A<br>
Terminal 105 receives contents and program support information such as service<br>
guide and content protection, and provides a broadcast service to the user. A<br>
BDS Service Distribution entity 111 delivers a mobile broadcast service to<br>
multiple terminals through communication with the Broadcast Distribution<br>
System 112 and an Interaction Network 113.<br>
The Broadcast Distribution System 112 delivers a mobile broadcast<br>
service over a broadcast channel, and the mobile broadcast service can include,<br>
for example, Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (MBMS) of 3rd Generation<br>
Project Partnership (3GPP), Broadcast Multicast Service (BCMCS) of 3rd<br>
Generation Project Partnership 2 (3GPP2), and DVB-Handheld (DVB-H) of<br>
Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB). The Broadcast Distribution System 112 can<br>
be an IP-based broadcast/communication network. The Interaction Network 113<br>
provides an interaction channel, and can be, for example, a cellular network.<br>
A description will now be made of reference points, which are<br>
connection paths between the logical entities. The reference points have multiple<br>
interfaces according to their purposes. The interfaces are used for<br>
communication between more than two logical entities, and the message format<br>
and protocol for them are applied to a particular purpose.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, BCAST-1 121 is a transmission path for contents<br>
and content attributes, and BCAST-2 122 is a transmission path for a content-<br>
protected/content-unprotected BCAST service, and attributes and content<br>
attributes of the BCAST service. BCAST-3 123 is a transmission path for<br>
attributes of a BCAST service, content attributes, user preference/subscription<br>
information, user request, and response to the request. BCAST-4 124 is a<br>

and key used for content protection and service protection.<br>
BCAST-5 125 is a transmission path for service-protected BCAST<br>
service, service-unprotected BCAST service, content-protected BCAST service,<br>
content-unprotected BCAST service, BCAST service attributes, content<br>
attributes, notification, service guide, security material such as Digital Right<br>
Management (DRM) Right Object (RO) and key value used for BCAST service<br><br>
protection, and all data and signals transmitted over a broadcast channel.<br>
BCAST-6 126 is a transmission path for service-protected BCAST<br>
service, service-unprotected BCAST service, content-protected BCAST service,<br>
content-unprotected BCAST service, BCAST service attributes, content<br>
attributes, notification, service guide, security material such as DRM RO and<br>
key value used for BCAST service protection, and all data and signals<br>
transmitted over an interaction channel.<br>
BCAST-7 127 is a transmission path for service provisioning,<br>
subscription information, device management, and user preference information<br>
transmitted over an interaction channel of control information related to<br>
reception of security material such as DRM RO and key value used for BCAST<br>
service protection. BCAST-8 128 is a transmission path with which user data for<br>
a BCAST service interacts. BDS-1 129 is a transmission path for service-<br>
protected BCAST service, service-unprotected BCAST service, BCAST service<br>
attributes, content attributes, notification, service guide, and security material<br>
such as DRM RO and key value used for BCAST service protection.<br>
BDS-2 130 is a transmission path for service provisioning, subscription<br>
information, device management, and security material such as DRM RO and<br>
key value used for BCAST service protection. X-l 131 is a reference point<br>
between the BDS Service Distribution Entity 111 and the Broadcast Distribution<br>
System 112. X-2 132 is a reference point between the BDS Service Distribution<br>
Entity 111 and the Interaction Network 113. X-3 133 is a reference point<br>
between the Broadcast Distribution System 112 and the Terminal 105. X-4 134<br>
is a reference point between the BDS Service Distribution Entity 111 and the<br>
Terminal 105 over a broadcast channel. X-5 135 is a reference point between the<br>
BDS Service Distribution Entity 111 and the Terminal 105 over an interaction<br>
channel. X-6 136 is a reference point between the Interaction Network 113 and<br>
the Terminal 105.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates a structure of a service guide used for receiving a<br>
broadcast service in a conventional mobile broadcasting system. This structure is<br>
for providing a broadcast service to a terminal in the BCAST system. One<br><br>
service guide is composed of fragments having their own purposes, and the<br>
fragments are divided into 4 groups according to usage.<br>
In FIG. 2, the service guide is composed of an Administrative group 200,<br>
a Provisioning group 210, a Core group 220 and an Access group 230. A solid<br>
line connecting the fragments indicates a cross-reference between the fragments.<br>
The Administrative group 200 is for providing basic information used by<br>
the terminal to receive the service guide, and includes a Service Guide Delivery<br>
Descriptor fragment 201. The Service Guide Delivery Descriptor fragment 201<br>
provides service guide IDentifier (ID), identification information of the service<br>
provider that has generated and delivered the service guide, and entire<br>
information of the service guide. In addition, the Service Guide Delivery<br>
Descriptor fragment 201 provides, to the terminal, scheduling information,<br>
update information, and information on a channel over which it can receive<br>
multiple service guide fragments, so that the terminal can receive only the<br>
necessary service guide at an appropriate time.<br>
The Provisioning group 210 is for providing charging information for<br>
service reception. The Provisioning group 210 includes a Purchase Item<br>
fragment 211, a Purchase Data fragment 212 and a Purchase Channel fragment<br>
213. The Purchase Item fragment 211 provides charging information for service<br>
or service bundle. The Purchase Data fragment 212 indicates actual price<br>
information for the purchased item. The Purchase Channel fragment 213<br>
provides information on the system and payment method by which the service<br>
user can actually purchase the service.<br>
The Core group 220 is for providing information on the service itself,<br>
and includes a Service fragment 221, a Schedule fragment 222 and a Content<br>
fragment 223. The Service fragment 221 provides a description of the service<br>
itself that the user will receive, and information on the contents, of which the<br>
service can be composed. The Schedule fragment 222 provides information on<br>
the time for which the service can be provided and used. The Content fragment<br>
223 provides information on each of multiple contents constituting the service.<br><br>
The Access group 230 includes an Access fragment 231 and a Session<br>
Description fragment 232. The Access group 230 provides service access<br>
information for receiving the services provided through the Core group 220, and<br>
detailed information on the session for which the contents constituting the<br>
corresponding service are delivered, thereby allowing the terminal to access the<br>
corresponding service.<br>
The Access fragment 231 provides multiple access methods to the<br>
terminal for one service, thereby providing a method in which the terminal can<br>
access various supplementary services based on one service. The Session<br>
Description fragment 232 provides session information for a service defined in<br>
one Access fragment. In addition to the four groups described above, the service<br>
guide information, as shown in FIG. 2, can further include a Preview Data<br>
fragment 224 for providing the preview and icon for the service and contents,<br>
and an Interactivity Data fragment 225 for supporting an interactivity service.<br>
Generally, the broadcasting system, as it is a unidirectional system, does<br>
not monitor whether the broadcast service has normally been delivered to the<br>
recipients. However, if it is possible to adjust a coding rate and/or a data rate of a<br>
broadcast service, the broadcasting system can receive a reception ratio fed back<br>
from the terminal and analyze the reception ratio, thereby providing the<br>
broadcast service with higher quality. Particularly, in an environment such as the<br>
mobile broadcasting system, where terminals frequently move and their<br>
reception ratios frequently change, the system can provide higher-quality<br>
broadcast service to the users by appropriately handling the frequent movement<br>
and the frequent change in the reception ratio depending on the report on the<br>
reception ratio. In addition, for the high-price mobile broadcast service, the<br>
quality of the reception ratio should be taken into full consideration.<br>
Based on the reception ratio report, the broadcasting system can adjust<br>
the broadcast quality to be suitable for the reception environment during<br>
transmission. However, in the broadcast standards proposed up to now, there is<br>
no definition of the detailed operation of the terminal and broadcasting system<br>
for the reception ratio report, and the message for the reception ratio report.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described in<br>
detail with reference to the annexed drawings. In the drawings, the same or<br>
similar elemenls are denoted by the same reference numerals even though they<br>
are depicted in different drawings, in the following description, a detailed<br>
description of known functions and configurations incorporated herein has been<br><br>
omitted for the sake of clarity and conciseness.<br>
Although embodiments of the present invention will be described herein<br>
with reference to the BCAST system, one of the mobile broadcast technology<br>
standards, it is not intended to limit of the scope of the present invention to the<br>
BCAST system. That is, it should be noted herein that the broadcasting system<br>
includes various communication systems supporting a broadcast service, such as<br>
the BCAST system and the Digital Video Broadcasting- Handheld (DVB-H)<br>
system. In addition, although the names of the entities defined in 3GPP, the<br>
asynchronous mobile communication standard, and/or in OMA BCAST, the<br>
standard group for application of terminal, will be used for a description of the<br>
present invention, it is not intended to limit the scope of the present invention to<br>
the standards and the names of the entities. Further, although a receiver of the<br>
BCAST system supporting the mobile broadcast service will be referred to<br>
herein as a mobile terminal, for convenience, the technical spirit of the present<br>
invention can also be applied to the wired communication system.<br>
In the BCAST system, the terminal according to the present invention is<br>
constructed to measure a loss ratio and a reception ratio of a Real-time Transport<br>
Protocol (RTP) packet in which a streaming service is delivered, and reports the<br>
measured ratios to the BCAST Service Distribution/Adaptation (BSDA). The<br>
term 'packet loss ratio' as used herein indicates a ratio of the total number of<br>
packets that should have been received for a measurement interval, to the<br>
number of lost packets, and the term 'reception ratio' indicates a ratio of the total<br>
number of packets that should have been received for a measurement interval, to<br>
the number of actually received packets. For the details related to delivery of a<br>
streaming service in the BCAST system, reference can be made to<br>
http://www.openmobilealliance.org/ftp/Public_documents/BAC/BCAST/Perman<br>
ent_documentS/()MA-TS-BCAST-Distribution-Vl 0_0-20060313-D.zip.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates a reception ratio report procedure for a streaming<br>
service in a mobile broadcasting system to which the present invention is<br>
applicable. Shown is the reception ratio report procedure defined in the BCAST<br>
system.<br><br>
Referring to FIG. 3, Stream Distribution (SD) in BSDA 300, a service<br>
entity included in the BCAST Service Distribution/Adaptation Entity 103 shown<br>
in FIG. 1, performs a function of broadcasting a streaming service. BDS Service<br>
Distribution 301 is identical to the BDS Service Distribution entity 111<br>
described in FIG. 1, and Interaction Network 302 is identical to the Interaction<br>
Network 113 described in FIG. 1. Stream Distribution-Client (SD-C) in Terminal<br>
303, an entity included in the Terminal 105 of FIG. 1, controls streaming service<br>
reception. For convenience, the SD in BSDA 300 and the SD-C in Terminal 303<br>
will be referred to as BSDA 300 and Terminal 303, respectively.<br>
If the Terminal 303 reports a reception ratio of a broadcast service to the<br>
BSDA 300 in step 310, the BSDA 300, a network entity, sends a message for<br>
acknowledging the reception ratio report (reception report) to the Terminal 303<br>
in step 311. In step 312, the BSDA 300 can report the reception ratio of the<br>
Terminal 303 to the BDS Service Distribution 301 to request quality<br>
improvement of the reception ratio. The operations of steps 311 and 312 are<br>
optional. In step 313, the BDS Service Distribution 301 sends a response for<br>
requesting quality improvement of the reception ratio to the BSDA 300. The<br>
present invention defines a process in which the terminal reports a reception<br>
ratio to the BSDA and the BSDA sends a response to the terminal as performed<br>
in steps 310 and 3 11 of FIG. 3. and also defines a detailed operation performed<br>
before the process. However, the present invention will omit discussion on an<br>
operation in which reception ratio report/response between the BSDA and the<br>
BDS Service Distribution is performed in steps 312 and 313 of FIG. 3.<br>
Before a description of a reception ratio report method for a streaming<br>
service in the BCAST system according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention is given, a description of items to be used in the existing BCAST<br>
service guide will be made for a better understanding of the present invention.<br>
Tables 1 and 2 show only the parts necessary for a description of the<br>
present invention, in the Access fragment 231 of the service guide described in<br>
FIG. 2. For a description of all fragments and a description of the service guide,<br>
reference	can	be	made	to<br>

Referring to Table 1 and Table 2, 'Name' indicates names of elements<br>
and attributes constituting a corresponding message. 'Type' indicates whether a<br>
type of the corresponding name is element or attribute. The elements have values<br>
El, E2, E3 and E4, wherein El indicates an upper element for the entire message,<br>
E2 indicates a sub-element of El, E3 indicates a sub-element of E2, and E4<br>
indicates a sub-element of E3. The attribute is denoted as 'A', and 'A' indicates<br>
an attribute of the corresponding element. For example, 'A' under El indicates<br>
an attribute of El 'Category' is used for indicating whether the corresponding<br>
element/attribute is mandatory. The corresponding element/attribute has a value<br>
M (Mandatory), when it is mandatory, and the corresponding element/attribute<br>
has a value 0 (Optional), when it is optional. 'Cardinality' indicates the<br>
relationship between the element, and has values 0, 0..1, 1, 0..n, l..n, wherein '0'<br>
indicates an optional relationship, ' 1' indicates a mandatory relationship, and 'n'<br>
indicates possibility of having multiple values. For example, '0..n! indicates that<br>
there can be no corresponding element, or the corresponding element can have n<br>
values. 'Description' indicates meaning of the corresponding element/attribute.<br>
In Table 1, the "SessionDescriptionReference" element, an element for<br>
providing information on session setup necessary for reception of a broadcast<br>
service, has as a sub-attribute an attribute called Uniform Resource Identifier<br>
(URI) indicating the place where the session information is located. This<br>
attribute, although it generally indicates the position where session information<br>
for reception of a broadcast service is acquired, can be defined to be used to<br>
indicate other session information related to the service, and can also indicate the<br><br>
position where the reception ratio report information presented by the present<br>
invention can be acquired. In process of accessing an access fragment to receive<br>
a service after receiving a service guide, if there is the URJ, the terminal receives<br>
and processes information having the corresponding URL If the information<br>
received using the URI has reception ratio report information, the terminal<br>
measures a reception ratio for the broadcast service that it is receiving after<br>
decrypting the corresponding reception ratio report information, and reports the<br>
measured reception ratio to the BSDA of the broadcasting system.<br>
Though not shown in FIG. 3, with reference to Tables 3 to 5, a definition<br>
will be given of a reception ratio report indication message with which the<br>
BSDA 300 instructs the Terminal 303 to report a reception ratio of a streaming<br>
service according to the present invention. The reception ratio report indication<br>
message, a message for the reception ratio report procedure, is composed of the<br>
elements and attributes described in Table 3 to Table 5, and can be expressed in a<br>
language such as Extensible Markup Language (XML).<br><br><br><br>
As shown in Table 3, the uppermost element of the reception ratio report<br>
indication message for the streaming service that BSDA 300 delivers to the<br>
Terminal 303, is "StreamingAssociatedProcedure", and it indicates of which<br>
basic elements/attributes the indication message is composed, and finally<br>
indicates a type of the indication message. Among the elements included in the<br>
"StreamingAssociatedProcedure", "measurementType" is an element designating<br>
a reception ratio report type of the streaming service, and the terminal measures<br>
reception ratio and loss ratio of the streaming service in the method designated<br>
in the "measurementType", and reports the corresponding reception ratio if a<br>
condition is satisfied. The "measurementType" includes its sub-elements of<br>
SessionMeasurement, FixedDurationMeasurement, IntervalMeasurement,<br>
ThresholdMeasurement and EventTriggredMeasurement.<br>
In Table 3, the "SessionMeasurement" element serves to instruct the<br>
Terminal 303 to report the reception ratio of the entire session for the service that<br>
it is now receiving or expects to receive. The Terminal 303 performs reception<br>
ratio measurement starting from the moment that it receives a first Real Time<br>
Transport Protocol (RTP) packet of its desired reception session, until the time<br>
the session ends, and reports the measurement result to the BSDA 300. If the<br>
Terminal 303 receives the service from the middle of the session, it measures the<br>
reception ratio from the time that it has started receiving the service, and reports<br>
the measurement result, and if the Terminal 303 ends the session in the middle<br>
thereof, it reports the reception ratio measurement result up to the time that it<br>
ends the session. In addition, if the Terminal 303 receives the service from the<br>
middle of the session and ends the session in the middle thereof, it measures<br>
reception ratios for the corresponding possible parts, and reports the measured<br>
reception ratios. A detailed description of the report method of the Terminal 303<br>
will be made herein below.<br>
Table 4<br><br><br>
In Tabic 4, the "FixedDurationMeasurement" element is an element by<br>
which the BSDA 300 designates and indicates, for the Terminal 303, a<br>
measurement interval for reception ratio report for the service that the<br>
corresponding terminal is now receiving or expects to receive. An RTP<br>
timestamp indicative of an RTP data sampling time is used herein as the<br>
measurement interval, and it designates startRTPTimestamp indicating a start<br>
timestamp, which is an attribute indicating a start point of the measurement<br>
interval, at which the reception ratio report is started, and an endRTPTimestamp<br>
indicating an end timestamp, which is an end point at which the measurement is<br><br>
ended. For the details of RTP, reference can be made to<br>
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc 1889.txt. Upon receipt of the indication for the<br>
measurement interval from the BSDA 300, the Terminal 303 performs<br>
measurement starting from the value in the startRTPTimestamp up to the value<br>
of the endRTPTimestamp, and reports the measurement result to the BSDA 300.<br>
If the Terminal 303 receives the service after the startRTPTimestamp, it<br>
performs measurement from its participation time and reports the measurement<br>
result. If the Terminal 303 ends the session before the endRTPTimestamp, it<br>
reports the measurement result up to the end time. In addition, if the Terminal<br>
303 receives the service after the startRTPTimestamp and ends the session<br>
before the endRTPTimestamp, it performs measurement for the corresponding<br>
possible parts and reports the measurement results.<br>
In Table 4, the "IntervalMeasurement" element is one by which the<br>
BSDA 300 instructs the Terminal 303 to report a reception ratio every period<br>
designated for the service that the corresponding terminal is now receiving or<br>
expects to receive. To this end, an interval value is designated in the<br>
"IntervalMeasurement" element, and the Terminal 303 measures a reception<br>
ratio by calculating an interval on the basis of timestamps of received RTP<br>
packets. The calculation of the interval starts from the moment that the Terminal<br>
303 receives a first RTP packet, and the result is reported when the service<br>
received through the corresponding session ends or the Terminal 303 ends the<br>
service.<br><br><br><br>
In Tabic 5, the "ThresholdMeasurement" element is for instructing the<br>
Terminal 303 to report a measured reception ratio when a loss ratio measured for<br>
the service that die Terminal 303 is now receiving or expects to receive, is higher<br>
than a threshold designated by the BSDA 300. That is, when the<br>
"ThresholdMeasurement" element of Table 5 is set, the Terminal 303 reports the<br>
reception ratio measured when the measured loss ratio is greater than the<br>
"ThresholdMeasurement" element of Table 5.<br>
The threshold can be a threshold not only for a packet loss ratio but also<br>
for the number of lost packets. The Terminal 303 continuously measures a<br>
reception ratio and a loss ratio from the time that it receives the service. If the<br>
measured loss ratio becomes less than the threshold over time, the Terminal 303<br>
collects information for the reception ratio report, and if the loss ratio becomes<br>
greater than the threshold again, the Terminal 303 reports the reception ratio to<br>
the BSDA 300. That is, if the packet loss ratio is greater than the threshold, the<br>
Terminal 303 sends a reception ratio report message with the measured reception<br><br>
ratio to the BSDA 300. If the loss ratio becomes less than the threshold gain, the<br>
Terminal 303 re-performs information collection for the reception ratio report.<br>
The 'information collection for the reception ratio report' as used herein refers to<br>
an action of collecting the information necessary for measuring the reception<br>
ratio and loss ratio, such as startRTPTimestamp, endRTPTimestamp, interval,<br>
packet loss ratio, expectedTotalPackets, receivedTotalPackets and<br>
lostTotalPackets. The foregoing process continues until the Terminal 303 ends<br>
the corresponding service.<br>
In Table 5, the "EventTriggeredMeasurement" element is for instructing<br>
the Terminal 303 to report the reception ratio when the loss ratio of the service<br>
that the Terminal 303 is now receiving or expects to receive, is greater than a<br>
trigger value designated by the BSDA 300. The Terminal 303 continuously<br>
measures a reception ratio and a loss ratio from the time that it receives the<br>
service. If the loss ratio becomes less than the trigger value over time, the<br>
Terminal 303 collects information for the reception ratio report, and if the loss<br>
ratio becomes greater the trigger value, the Terminal 303 includes the reception<br>
ratio collected up to the end time of the corresponding service in a reception<br>
ratio report message and sends the reception ratio report message to the BSDA<br>
300.<br>
Tables 6 to 8 show a format of a reception ratio report message with<br>
which the Terminal 303 reports a reception ratio of the streaming service<br>
according to a first embodiment of the present invention. The reception ratio<br>
report message is composed of the elements and attributes described in Table 6<br>
to Table 8, and can be expressed in a language such as XML.<br>
Unlike the reception ratio report indication message for the streaming<br>
service, defined in Table 3 to Table 5, the reception ratio report message for the<br>
streaming service, described in Table 6 to Table 8, is given in one format, and it<br>
is associated with all of the following 5 reception ratio measurement types.<br><br><br><br>
In Table 6, the "StreamingReceptionReport" element, the uppermost<br>
element of the reception ratio report message for the streaming service, has the<br>
following elements and attributes. The "reportType" element is used to report the<br>
BSDA 300 which reception ratio measurement type was used in the Terminal<br>
303. Based on the "reportType", the BSDA 300 can determine the manner in<br>
which the reception ratio information received from the Terminal 303 was<br>
measured, and il can be used for classilying and analyzing the reception ratio.<br><br><br>
In Table 7, the "measurementStartRTPTimestamp" element and the<br>
"measurementEndRTPTimestamp" element indicate the start and end periods<br>
where the measurement was made for the reception ratio report, respectively.<br>
The two values indicate timestamp values of the first RTP packet and the last<br>
RTP packet that the Terminal 303 actually receives for the reception ratio<br>
measurement by receiving the service.<br>
The	"expectedTotalPackets",	"receivedTotalPackets"	and<br>
"lostTotalPackets" indicate the total number of expected packets (or the total<br>
number of packets that the Terminal 303 expects to receive, or the total number<br>
of packets that the Terminal 303 should have received for the measurement<br><br>
interval), the total number of packets that the Terminal 303 has actually received,<br>
and the total number of lost packets (or the total number of packets that<br>
underwent loss or error), respectively. The "expectedTotalPackets" is the total<br>
number of packets that the Terminal 303 expects to receive for the period from<br>
the time the Terminal 303 started the measurement until the end time of the<br>
measurement, and it can be obtained by calculating a difference between a<br>
timestamp of the start time and a timestamp of the end time. The<br>
"receivedTotalPackets" is the total number of packets that the Terminal 303 has<br>
actually received for the period in which it receives the "expectedTotalPackets".<br>
The "lostTotalPackets" is the total number of packets that the Terminal 303 has<br>
failed to receive for the period in which it receives the "expectedTotalPackets",<br>
or that the Terminal 303 has received but the received packets have undergone<br>
error. The foregoing three attributes are optional attributes, and can be reference<br>
information for reception ratio classification and analysis.<br>
The "receptionRatio" attribute can be calculated depending on<br>
"expectedTotalPackets" and "receivedTotalPackets" or "lostTotalPackets", and<br>
indicates the total reception ratio occurred during the measurement interval. For<br>
example, the reception ratio receptionRatio can be calculated depending on a<br>
ratio of expectedTotalPackets to receivedTotalPackets. Therefore, as for the<br>
reception ratio, the BSDA 300 can comprehend the reception ratio of the<br>
Terminal 303 depending on the values in the foregoing attributes. Upon receipt<br>
of a report on the reception ratio from multiple terminals through the attribute<br>
values, the BSDA 300 can analyze the reception ratio and take an appropriate<br>
action for quality improvement necessary for the corresponding service, thereby<br>
improving the service quality. Based on the reception ratio information received<br>
from the Terminal 303, the BSDA 300 can later control the service delivery<br>
efficiency. For example, when the reception ratio is high, the BSDA 300 can<br>
reduce the error coding rate to allocate the remaining bandwidth to additional<br>
services.<br>
The "globalContent ID" is an identifier of the contents of the service that<br>
underwent reception ratio measurement, and is reported for use later for<br>
reception ratio classification and analysis in the BSDA 300. The "sessionID" is a<br>
session identifier of the service that underwent the reception ratio measurement,<br><br>
and is reported for use later for reception ratio classification and analysis in the<br>
BSDA300.<br><br>
In Table 8, the "globalServicelD" is an identifier of the service that<br>
underwent the reception ratio measurement, and is reported for use later for<br>
reception ratio classification and analysis in the BSDA 300. The "serverURI"<br>
indicates an address of the BSDA 300 that should receive a reception ratio report.<br>
The "serviceArea" indicates the position where the Terminal 303 has measured<br>
the reception ratio, can be used for selecting the low-reception ratio area and is<br>
optional. The "celllD" indicates the cell where the Terminal 303 has measured a<br>
reception ratio when the Terminal 303 is connected to a 3GPP/3GPP2 network,<br><br>
can be used for selecting the low-reception ratio area and is optional. The<br>
"DevicelD" is an identifier of the Terminal 303 that makes a reception ratio<br>
report, and it has, as its sub-attribute, a Type attribute indicating a type of the<br>
identifier. As the mobile broadcasting system such as BCAST can be used in<br>
various types of broadcast networks, there are various types of available<br>
terminals. Because not all of the terminals are compatible with each other, it is<br>
possible to notify the incompatibility using the Type attribute.<br>
Tables 9 to 11 show a format of a reception ratio report message with<br>
which the Terminal 303 reports a reception ratio of the streaming service<br>
according to a second embodiment of the present invention. This embodiment is<br>
provided by considering a service model that can be composed of multiple<br>
sessions and/or multiple contents in one access fragment. In addition, the<br>
reception ratio report message according to the second embodiment is composed<br>
of the elements and attributes described in Tables 9 to 11, and can be expressed<br>
in a language such as XML.<br>
Unlike the reception ratio report message for the streaming service,<br>
described in Tables 6 to 8, the reception ratio report message for the streaming<br>
service, described in Tables 9 to 11, is a reception ratio report message to be<br>
associated with a transport session composed of multiple contents and/or<br>
multiple sessions, and it is associated with all of the 5 reception ratio<br>
measurement types defined in Tables 6 to 8.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
In Table 9, the "StreamingReceptionReport" element, the uppermost<br>
element of the reception ratio report message for the streaming service, has the<br>
following elements and attributes. The "serverURI" indicates an address of the<br>
BSDA 300 that should receive a reception ratio report, and the<br>
"globalServicelD" is an identifier of the broadcast streaming service that<br>
underwent the reception ratio measurement, and is reported for use later for<br>
reception ratio classification and analysis in the BSDA 300.<br>
The "DevicelD" is an identifier of the Terminal 303 that makes a<br>
reception ratio report, and it has, as its sub-attribute, a Type attribute indicating a<br>
type of the identifier. As the mobile broadcasting system such as BCAST can be<br>
used in various types of broadcast networks, there are various types of available<br>
terminals. Because not all of the terminals are compatible with each other, it is<br>
possible to notify the incompatibility using the Type attribute.<br>
The "session!!)" is a session identifier of the service that underwent the<br>
reception ratio measurement, and is reported for use later for reception ratio<br>
classification and analysis in the BSDA 300. Because one service can be<br>
composed of several sessions, a plurality of the "sessionID" can be recorded, and<br>
it has a sub-element called "globalContentID" of Table 10. The<br>
"globalContentID" is an identifier of the contents of the service that underwent<br>
reception ratio measurement, and is reported for use later for reception ratio<br>
classification and analysis in the BSDA 300. Because one session can be<br>
composed of several contents, a plurality of the "globalContentID" can be<br>
recorded. The "globalContentID" has the following 9 attributes.<br>
In Table 10, the "reportType" element is used to report the BSDA 300<br>
which reception ratio measurement type was used in the Terminal 303. Based on<br>
the "reportType", the BSDA 300 can determine the manner in which the<br>
reception ratio information received from the Terminal 303 was measured, and it<br>
can be used for classifying and analyzing the reception ratio. The<br>
"measurementStartRTPTimestamp"	element	and	the<br>
"measurementEndRTPTimestamp" element indicate the start and end periods<br>
where the measurement was made for the reception ratio report, respectively.<br>
The two values indicate timestamp values of the first RTP packet and the last<br><br>
RTP packet that the Terminal 303 actually receives for the reception ratio<br>
measurement by receiving the service.<br>
In Table 11, the "expectedTotalPackets", "receivedTotalPackets" and<br>
"lostTotalPackets" indicate the total number of packets that the Terminal 303<br>
should have received for the measurement interval, the total number of packets<br>
that the Terminal 303 has actually received, and the total number of packets that<br>
underwent loss or error, respectively. The "expectedTotalPackets" is the total<br>
number of packets that the Terminal 303 should have received for the period<br>
from the time the Terminal 303 started the measurement until the end time of the<br>
measurement, and can be obtained by calculating a difference between a<br>
timestamp of the start time and a timestamp of the end time. The<br>
"receivedTotalPackets" is the total number of packets that the Terminal 303 has<br>
actually received for the period in which it receives the "expectedTotalPackets".<br>
The "lostTotalPackets" is the total number of packets that the Terminal 303 has<br>
failed to receive for the period in which it receives the "expectedTotalPackets",<br>
or that the Terminal 303 has received but the received packets have undergone<br>
error. The foregoing "expectedTotalPackets", "receivedTotalPackets" and<br>
"lostTotalPackets" are optional attributes, and can be reference information for<br>
reception ratio classification and analysis and can be used for calculating the loss<br>
ratio.<br>
The "receptionRatio" attribute can be calculated depending on the<br>
"expectedTotalPackets" and the "receivedTotalPackets" or the "lostTotalPackets",<br>
and indicates the total reception ratio occurred during the measurement interval.<br>
For example, the "receptionRatio" can be determined as a ratio of the<br>
"expectedTotalPackets" indicating the total number of expected packets, to the<br>
"receivedTotalPackets" indicating the total number of actually received packets.<br>
In addition, the packet loss ratio can be determined as a ratio of the<br>
"expectedTotalPackets" indicating the total number of expected packets, to the<br>
"lostTotalPackets" indicating the total number of lost packets. Based on the<br>
value in the "receptionRatio" attribute, the BSDA 300 can comprehend the<br>
reception ratio of the Terminal 303. Upon receipt of a report on the reception<br>
ratio from multiple terminals through the attribute values, the BSDA 300 can<br>
analyze the reception ratio and take an appropriate action for quality<br><br>
improvement necessary for the corresponding service, thereby improving the<br>
service quality. Based on the reception ratio information received from the<br>
Terminal 303, the BSDA 300 can later control the service delivery efficiency.<br>
For example, when the reception ratio is high, the BSDA 300 can reduce the<br>
error coding rate to allocate the remaining bandwidth to additional services.<br>
Finally, "serviceArea" indicates the position where the Terminal 303 has<br>
measured the reception ratio, can be used for selecting the low-reception ratio<br>
area and is optional. The "celHD" indicates the cell where the Terminal 303 has<br>
measured a reception ratio when the Terminal 303 is connected to the<br>
3GPP/3GPP2 network, can be used for selecting the low-reception ratio area and<br>
is optional.<br>
FIG. 4 illustrates a terminal's operation of reporting a reception ratio of a<br>
streaming service in a broadcasting system according to the present invention.<br>
In step 400, a Terminal 303 receives an access fragment, which is a part<br>
of a service guide. Upon receiving the access fragment having the format of<br>
Tables 1 and 2 in step 400, the Terminal 303 determines presence/absence of a<br>
reception ratio report indication message according to presence of URI. In step<br>
401, the Terminal 303 acquires a reception ratio report indication message via an<br>
Interaction Network 302 using the URI of step 400. In step 402, the Terminal<br>
303 decrypts and analyzes the reception ratio report indication message acquired<br>
in step 401. Based on the reception ratio report indication message analyzed in<br>
step 402, the Terminal 303 performs, in step 403, reception ratio measurement<br>
according to the determined reception ratio measurement type, and particularly<br>
performs the reception ratio measurement according to the designated<br>
measurement type among the five measurement types 404 to 408 described<br>
below with reference to FIGs. 5 to 9. A detailed description of each measurement<br>
type will be made with reference to the corresponding diagram.<br>
A brief description will first be made of the five reception ratio<br>
measurement types. Step 404 is a procedure performed when the measurement<br>
type in the reception ratio report indication message is designated as a<br>
SessionMeasurement element indicating the session measurement type. The<br>
'session', which is defined by the service provider, indicates the start-to-end<br><br>
period in which the Terminal 303 receives contents. In step 404, the Terminal<br>
303 measures a reception ratio for the entire service received over the session<br>
that it desires/expects to receive, and reports the measurement result to the<br>
BSDA 300. For the reception ratio measurement, the Terminal 303 performs<br>
measurement from the time it receives a first RTP packet of the service until the<br>
time it receives the last RTP packet. If the Terminal 303 accesses the<br>
broadcasting system after the time the session starts, or if the Terminal 303<br>
releases the access for the corresponding service before the time the session ends,<br>
the Terminal 303 performs measurement for the time it receives the service.<br>
Step 405 is a procedure performed when a measurement type in<br>
reception ratio report indication message is designated as a<br>
FixedDurationMeasurement element indicating the fixed duration measurement<br>
type. In step 405, the Terminal 303 performs reception ratio measurement for the<br>
service that it desires/expects to receive, for the duration designated in the<br>
reception ratio report indication message, and reports the measurement result to<br>
the BSDA 300. For the reception ratio measurement, the Terminal 303 receives<br>
and checks a timestamp of an RTP packet of the service on which it desires to<br>
perform the measurement, and performs the measurement, if the packet<br>
corresponds to a packet in the designated measurement interval. If the timestamp<br>
of the RTP packet deviates from the designated measurement interval, the<br>
Terminal 303 stops the measurement. If the Terminal 303 accesses the<br>
broadcasting system after the start time of the designated session, or releases the<br>
session access before the end time of the session, the Terminal 303 performs the<br>
measurement for the time it has received the service.<br>
Step 406 is a procedure performed when the measurement type in the<br>
reception ratio report indication message is designated as an<br>
IntervalMeasurement element indicating the interval measurement type. In step<br>
406, the Terminal 303 measures the reception ratio for the service that it<br>
desires/expects to receive over the session, every interval designated in the<br>
reception ratio report indication message, and reports the measured reception<br>
ratio to the BSDA 300. For the reception ratio measurement, the Terminal 303<br>
continuously performs reception ratio measurement from the time it receives a<br>
first RTP packet of the service on which it desires to perform the measurement,<br><br>
and makes a reception ratio report every interval designated on the basis of a<br>
timestamp of the first RTP packet.<br>
Step 407 is a procedure performed when the measurement type in the<br>
reception ratio report indication message is designated as a<br>
ThresholdMeasurement element indicating the threshold measurement type. In<br>
step 407, the Terminal 303 continuously measures the loss ratio from the time it<br>
receives a first RTP packet for the service that it desires/expects to receive over<br>
the session. In the meantime, if the loss ratio becomes less than a threshold set in<br>
the reception ratio report indication message, the Terminal 303 collects data for a<br>
reception ratio report, and if the loss ratio becomes greater than the threshold,<br>
the Terminal 303 reports the reception ratio to the BSDA 300. In step 407, the<br>
Terminal 303 continuously repeatedly calculates the reception ratio on the basis<br>
of the threshold while receiving the corresponding service, thereby continuously<br>
making the report.<br>
Step 408 is a procedure performed when the measurement type in the<br>
reception ratio report indication message is designated as an<br>
EventTriggered Measurement element indicating the event triggered<br>
measurement type. In step 408, the Terminal 303 continuously measures the<br>
reception ratio and loss ratio from the time it receives a first RTP packet for the<br>
service that it desires/expects to receive. In the meantime, if the loss ratio<br>
becomes less than a trigger value in the reception ratio report indication message,<br>
the Terminal 303 collects data for the reception ratio report procedure for the<br>
reception ratio report, and if the loss ratio becomes greater than the trigger value,<br>
the Terminal 303 reports to the BSDA 300 the reception ratio measured and<br>
collected up to the time the corresponding service ends.<br>
After measuring the reception ratio with one of the measurement types<br>
designated in steps 404 to 408, the Terminal 303 generates in step 409 a<br>
reception ratio report message shown in fables 9 to 11 using the measured<br>
reception ratio information, and sends the reception ratio report message to the<br>
BSDA 300. Thereafter, if the BSDA 300, a network entity, receiving the<br>
reception ratio report message sent by the Terminal 303, sends an ACK message<br>
acknowledging the reception ratio report message, the Terminal 303 receives the<br><br>
ACK message in step 410. The operation of step 410 is optional.<br>
In step 403, if the Terminal 303 has failed to check the determined<br>
reception ratio measurement type due to message reception failure, the Terminal<br>
303 can end the reception ratio measurement operation as shown in FIG. 4, or<br>
can measure a reception ratio according to a preset default measurement type<br>
among the foregoing five measurement types. Although the disclosed<br>
embodiment prepares multiple measurement types and measures the reception<br>
ratio according to a designated one of them, when a single measurement type is<br>
predefined between the BSDA 300 and the Terminal 303, it is also possible to<br>
measure the reception ratio according to the predefined measurement type.<br>
The terminal for reporting the reception ratio of the streaming service<br>
shown in FIG. 4 can include a message receiver for receiving a reception ratio<br>
report indication message having the format of Tables 1 to 5, a message<br>
transmitter for transmitting a reception ratio report message having the format of<br>
Tables 6 to 8 or the format of Tables 9 to 11, and a reception ratio measurer for<br>
measuring the reception ratio according to a measurement type designated in the<br>
reception ratio report indication message, and transmitting the measurement<br>
result to the broadcasting system using the reception ratio report message.<br>
FIG. 5 illustrates a reception ratio measurement method for a streaming<br>
service according to a first embodiment of the present invention, and this method<br>
indicates the detailed "SessionMeasurement" process of step 404 in the<br>
terminal's operation of FIG. 4.<br>
In step 500, a Terminal 303 receives an RTP packet of a desired service<br>
from a BSDA 300. After receiving the RTP packet in step 500, the Terminal 303<br>
determines in step 501 whether the received packet is a first packet of the desired<br>
session, or its following packet. If the desired session has not started yet, the<br>
Terminal 303 continues to receive the RTP packet and check each packet.<br>
However, if the received packet is a packet of the desired session, the Terminal<br>
303 checks in step 502 whether reception ratio recording is started. In step 502,<br>
the Terminal 303 checks whether it has recorded a start session RTP timestamp<br>
value in a measurementStartRTPTimestamp, to determine whether the reception<br><br>
ratio recording is started. If there is no recorded value, the Terminal 303<br>
proceeds to step 503, because it means that the reception ratio recording is first<br>
started. If the reception ratio recording is first started, the Terminal 303 records<br>
in a measurementStartRTPTimestamp an RTPtimestamp of a first packet<br>
received after accessing the session, and separately records a sequence number<br>
as well in step 503, to later notify the record time. Thereafter, the Terminal 303<br>
proceeds to step 504. After the reception ratio recording is started in step 502,<br>
the Terminal 303 records a receivedTotalPackets in step 504, and the<br>
receivedTotalPackets value is a counter that sequentially increases one by one<br>
each time the packet is received. Thereafter, in step 505, the Terminal 303<br>
records in a lostTotalPackets the packets that it has received but which<br>
underwent error or loss. The Terminal 303 can detect the packet loss by<br>
comparing a sequence number of the received RTP packet with a sequence<br>
number of a previously received packet. In step 506, the Terminal 303 checks<br>
whether the received packet is the last packet of the desired session. If the<br>
received packet is not the last packet, the Terminal 303 returns to step 500 and<br>
repeats its succeeding steps. However, if the received packet is the last packet of<br>
the session, the Terminal 303 records in a measurementEndRTPTimestamp a<br>
timestamp of the last packet, and separately records a sequence number as well<br>
in step 507. In step 508, the Terminal 303 calculates the total number of packets<br>
that it should have received, and stores it in an expectedTotalPackets. This value<br>
is can be calculated depending on an RTP sequence number at the measurement<br>
start time and the last RTP sequence number. Finally, in step 509, the Terminal<br>
303 calculates a reception ratio based on the receivedTotalPackets and the<br>
expectedTotalPackets, and then proceeds to step 409 of FIG. 4. For example, the<br>
Terminal 303 calculates the reception ratio depending on a ratio of the<br>
expectedTotalPackets to the receivedTotalPackets, and generates a reception<br>
ratio report message including the calculated reception ratio.<br>
FIG. 6 illustrates a reception ratio measurement method for a streaming<br>
service according to a second embodiment of the present invention, and this<br>
method indicates the detailed "FixedDurationMeasurement" process of step 405<br>
in the terminal's operation of FIG. 4.<br>
In steps 600 and 601, a Terminal 303 receives and sets<br><br>
startRTPTimestamp(sRT) and endRTPTimestamp(eRT) values of the reception<br>
ratio report indication message described in Table 4. In the following process,<br>
the Terminal 303 measures a reception ratio for a RTP packet in the two<br>
timestamp values. After the setting of steps 600 and 601 is completed, the<br>
Terminal 303 receives an RTP packet of a desired service from a BSDA 300 in<br>
step 602, and compares a timestamp of the received RTP packet with the<br>
startRTPTimestamp in step 603 to determine whether the RTP packet received in<br>
step 602 corresponds to a timestamp value for starting reception ratio<br>
measurement. As a result of the comparison of step 603, if the Timestamp of the<br>
RTP packet received in step 602 is equal to or greater than the<br>
startRTPTimestamp, the Terminal 303 proceeds to step 604, starting the<br>
reception ratio measurement. Otherwise, the Terminal 303 returns to step 602. In<br>
step 604, the Terminal 303 checks whether reception ratio recording is started.<br>
The Terminal 303 can determine whether the reception ratio recording is started,<br>
by checking whether it has recorded a start session RTP timestamp value in a<br>
measurementStartRTPTimestamp. If there is no recorded value, the Terminal 303<br>
proceeds to step 605, because it means that the reception ratio recording is first<br>
started. When the reception ratio recording is started, the Terminal 303 records<br>
in a measurementStartRTPTimestamp an RTPtimestamp of the packet received<br>
in step 602, and separately records a sequence number as well in step 605, to<br>
later notify the record time. If the reception ratio recording hasbeen started, the<br>
Terminal 303 records a receivedTotalPackets in step 606. The value recorded in<br>
the receivedTotalPackets herein is a counter value that sequentially increases one<br>
by one each time the packet is received. Thereafter, in step 607, the Terminal 303<br>
records in a lostTotalPackets the packets that it has received but which<br>
underwent error or loss. As for the lost packet, the Terminal 303 can determine<br>
whether the packet is lost by comparing a sequence number of the received RTP<br>
packet with a sequence number of a previously received packet. In step 608, the<br>
Terminal 303 compares an RTP timestamp of the received packet with the<br>
endRTPTimestamp set in step 601 to determine whether the received packet is<br>
the last packet that it has desired to measure. If the received packet in the step<br>
602 is not the last packet, the Terminal 303 returns to step 602 and repeats its<br>
succeeding steps. In the step 608, if the RTPtimestamp of the received packet in<br>
the step 602 is equal to or less than the set endRTPTimestamp, it indicates that<br>
the received packet is not the last packet. If it is determined in step 608 that the<br><br>
.received packet is the last packet, the Terminal 303 records in a<br>
measurementEndRTPTimestamp a timestamp of the last packet and separately<br>
records a sequence number as well in step 609. Thereafter, in step 610, the<br>
Terminal 303 calculates the total number of packets that it should have received,<br>
and stores it in an expectedTotalPackets. The expectedTotalPackets value can be<br>
calculated depending on the RTP sequence number of the packet received at the<br>
measurement start time and the sequence number of the last received packet.<br>
Finally, in step 611, the Terminal 303 calculates a reception ratio based on the<br>
receivedTotalPackets and the expectedTotalPackets, and then proceeds to step<br>
409 of FIG. 4. For example, the Terminal 303 calculates the reception ratio<br>
depending on a ratio of the expectedTotalPackets to the receivedTotalPackets,<br>
and generates a reception ratio report message including the calculated reception<br>
ratio.<br>
FIG. 7 illustrates a reception ratio measurement method for a streaming<br>
service according to a third embodiment of the present invention, and this<br>
method indicates the detailed "IntervalMeasurement" process of step 406 in the<br>
terminal's operation of FIG. 4.<br>
In step 700, the Terminal 303 receives and sets an interval value set in<br>
the reception ratio report indication message described in Table 4. In this<br>
embodiment, the reception ratio report is periodically made on the basis of the<br>
set interval value. After setting the interval value in step 700, the Terminal 303<br>
receives in step 701 an RTP packet of the desired service from a BSDA 300, and<br>
checks in step 702 whether reception ratio recording is started. In step 702, the<br>
Terminal 303 can determine whether the reception ratio recording is started, by<br>
checking whether it has recorded a start session RTP timestamp value in a<br>
measurementStartRTPTimestamp. If there is no recorded value, the Terminal 303<br>
proceeds to step 703, because it means that the reception ratio recording is first<br>
started. When the reception ratio recording is first started, the Terminal 303<br>
records in a measureinentStartRTPTimestamp an RTPtimestamp of a packet first<br>
received after accessing the session, and separately records a sequence number<br>
as well in step 703, to later notify the record time. If the reception ratio recording<br>
has been started, the Terminal 303 records a receivedTotalPackets in step 704.<br>
The recorded receivedTotalPackets value herein is a counter value that<br><br>
sequentially increases one by one each time the packet is received. Thereafter, in<br>
step 705, the Terminal 303 records in a lostTotalPackets the packets that it has<br>
received but which underwent error or loss. The Terminal 303 can detect the lost<br>
packet by comparing a sequence number of the received RTP packet with a<br>
sequence number of a previously received packet. In step 706, the Terminal 303<br>
calculates counter value on the basis of a timestamp of the received RTP packet.<br>
That is, the Terminal 303 prepares an interval counter and increases the counter<br>
value every time it receives a packet. Also, the interval counter is reset every<br>
time the reception ratio report message is transmitted. In step 707, the Terminal<br>
303 compares the counter value calculated in step 706 with the interval value set<br>
in step 700. If the counter value calculated in step 706 is less than the interval<br>
value set in step 700, the Terminal 303 returns to step 701, and if the interval<br>
values are equal to each other, the Terminal 303 proceeds to step 708. In step<br>
708, the Terminal 303 records in a measurementEndRTPTimestamp a timestamp<br>
of the received RTP packet, and separately records a sequence number as well.<br>
In step 709, the Terminal 303 calculates the total number of packets that it<br>
should have received, and records it in an expectedTotalPackets. The recorded<br>
expectedTotalPackets value can be calculated depending on the RTP sequence<br>
number of the packet received at a start time of the reception ratio measurement<br>
and the RTP sequence number of the last received packet.<br>
In step 710, the Terminal 303 calculates a reception ratio depending on<br>
the receivedTotalPackets and the expectedTotalPackets. For example, the<br>
Terminal 303 calculates the reception ratio depending on a ratio of the<br>
expectedTotalPackets to the receivedTotalPackets, and generates a reception<br>
ratio report message including the calculated reception ratio. In step 711, the<br>
Terminal 303 determines whether the currently received packet is the last packet<br>
of its current service. If the current session is still in progress, the Terminal 303<br>
proceeds to step 712 where it generates a reception ratio report message and<br>
sends it to the BSDA 300. In step 712, for the reception ratio report, the Terminal<br>
303 generates the reception ratio report message by setting the elements and<br>
attributes defined in Tables 6 to 8. or Tables 9 to 11. After sending the generated<br>
reception ratio report message, the Terminal 303 can optionally receive a<br>
reception ratio report ACKnowledgement (ACK) from the BSDA 300, or a<br>
network entity, in step 713. Also, in the step 714, the terminal 303 initiates the<br><br>
counter value and performs reception ratio report. Thereafter, However, if it is<br>
determined in step 711 that the session has ended, the following operation<br>
proceeds to step 409 of FIG. 4. If the Terminal 303 ends the session before the<br>
session expires, the Terminal 303 generates a reception ratio report message<br>
based on the information up to the end time, and sends the generated reception<br>
ratio report message. Referring to FIG. 7, it can be noted that before the session<br>
ends, the Terminal 303 measures the reception ratio at every predetermined<br>
interval and reports the measurement result, and after the session ends, the<br>
Terminal 303 measures the reception ratio for the entire session and reports the<br>
measurement result.<br>
FIG. 8 illustrates a reception ratio measurement method for a streaming<br>
service according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention, and this<br>
method indicates the detailed "ThresholdMeasurement" process of step 407 in<br>
the terminal's operation of FIG. 4.<br>
In step 800, the Terminal 303 sets a threshold to be compared with a loss<br>
ratio, as a threshold included in the reception ratio report indication message<br>
described in Table 5. In this embodiment, if a loss ratio calculated based on the<br>
set threshold becomes less than the threshold, the Terminal 303 collects<br>
information for the reception ratio report, and if the loss ratio becomes greater<br>
than threshold again, the Terminal 303 makes a reception ratio report. This<br>
reception ratio report operation is repeatedly performed until the session ends as<br>
a check result of step 810. After the setting in step 800 is completed, the<br>
Terminal 303 receives an RTP packet of the desired service from a BSDA 300 in<br>
step 801, and checks in step 802 whether reception ratio recording is started. In<br>
step 802, the Terminal 303 can determine whether the reception ratio recording<br>
is started, by checking whether it has recorded a start session RTP timestamp<br>
value in a measurementStartRTPTimestamp. If there is no recorded value, the<br>
Terminal 303 proceeds to step 803, because it means that the reception ratio<br>
recording is first started. When the reception ratio recording is first started, the<br>
Terminal 303 records in a measurementStartRTPTimestamp an RTPtimestamp of<br>
a packet first received after accessing the session, and separately records a<br>
sequence number as well in step 803, to later notify the record time. If the<br>
reception ratio recording has been started, the Terminal 303 records a<br><br>
receivedTotalPackets in step 804. The value recorded in the<br>
receivedTotalPaekets herein is a counter value that sequentially increases one by<br>
one each time the packet is received. Thereafter, in step 805, the Terminal 303<br>
records in a lostTotalPackets the packets that it has received but which<br>
underwent error or loss. The Terminal 303 can detect the lost packet by<br>
comparing a sequence number of the received RTP packet with a sequence<br>
number of a previously received packet. In step 806, the Terminal 303 records in<br>
a measurementEndRTPTimestamp a timestamp of the packet received in step<br>
801, and separately records a sequence number as well. In step 807, the Terminal<br>
303 calculates the total number of packets that it should have received, and<br>
records it in an expectedTotalPackets. The value recorded in the<br>
expectedTotalPackets can be calculated depending on the RTP sequence number<br>
of the packet received at a measurement start time of the terminal and the RTP<br>
sequence number of the last packet. In step 808, the Terminal 303 calculates the<br>
reception ratio and loss ratio depending on the receivedTotalPackets and the<br>
expectedTotalPackets. For example, the Terminal 303 calculates the reception<br>
ratio depending on a ratio of the expectedTotalPackets to the<br>
receivedTotalPackets, and calculates the loss ratio depending on a ratio of the<br>
expectedTotalPackets to the lostTotalPackets. In step 809, the Terminal 303<br>
compares the loss ratio calculated in step 808 with the threshold. As a result of<br>
the comparison, if the loss ratio is less than the threshold, the Terminal 303<br>
returns to step 801 because there is no need to make a report. However, if the<br>
loss ratio is greater than the threshold, the Terminal 303 proceeds to step 810<br>
because there is a need for a reception ratio report. In step 810, the Terminal 303<br>
determines whether the currently received packet is the last packet of the service<br>
that it is receiving over the session. If the session is still in progress, the<br>
Terminal 303 proceeds to step 811 where it generates a reception ratio report<br>
message for a reception ratio report and sends it to the BSDA300. Instep 811,<br>
for the reception ratio report, the Terminal 303 generates the reception ratio<br>
report message by setting the values calculated in steps 804 to 808 as the<br>
elements and attributes defined in fables 6 to 8, or Tables 9 to 11. After sending<br>
the generated reception ratio report message, the Terminal 303 can optionally<br>
receive a reception ratio report ACK message from the BSDA 300 in step 812.<br>
However, if it is determined in step 810 that the session has ended, the Terminal<br>
303 proceeds to step 409 of FIG. 4. Before the session ends as a check result of<br><br>
step 810, the Terminal 303 sends a reception ratio report message including the<br>
reception ratio measured each time the loss ratio is greater than the threshold.<br>
After the session ends as a check result of step 810, the Terminal 303 sends a<br>
reception ratio report message including the reception ratio measured during the<br>
entire session. If the Terminal 303 ends the session before the session expires,<br>
the Terminal 303 generates and sends a reception ratio report message based on<br>
the information up to the end time.<br>
FIG. 9 illustrates a reception ratio measurement method for a streaming<br>
service according to a fifth embodiment of the present invention, and this<br>
method indicates the detailed "EventTriggeredMeasurement" process of step 408<br>
in the terminal's operation of FIG. 4.<br>
In step 900, a Terminal 303 sets a trigger value for generating a<br>
reception ratio report message according to a trigger value included in the<br>
reception ratio report indication message described in Table 5. In the fifth<br>
embodiment shown in FIG. 9, if a loss ratio measured on the basis of the set<br>
trigger value becomes less than the trigger value, information for a report is<br>
collected and the report is made at an end time of the session. The trigger value<br>
can be either a loss ratio or a reception ratio. In the present invention, the trigger<br>
value will be assumed to be a particular value compared by the terminal to make<br>
a reception ratio report. After setting the trigger value in step 900, the Terminal<br>
303 receives an RTP packet of a desired service from a BSDA 300 in step 901,<br>
and checks in step 902 whether reception ratio recording is started. In step 902,<br>
the Terminal 303 can determine whether the reception ratio recording is started,<br>
by checking whether it has recorded a start session RTP timestamp value in a<br>
measurementStartRTPTimestamp. If there is no recorded value, the Terminal 303<br>
proceeds to step 903, because it means that the reception ratio recording is first<br>
started.. When the reception ratio recording is first started, the Terminal 303<br>
records in a measurementStartRTPTimestamp a timestamp of a first packet<br>
received after accessing the session, and separately records a sequence number<br>
as well in step 903, to later notify the record time. If it is determined in step 902<br>
that the reception ratio recording has already been started, the Terminal 303<br>
records a receivedTotalPackets in step 904. The value recorded in the<br>
receivedTotalPackets herein is a counter value that sequentially increases one by<br>
one each time the packet is received. Thereafter, in step 905, the Terminal 303<br><br>
records in a lostTotalPackets the packets that it has received but which<br>
underwent error or loss. The Terminal 303 can detect the lost packet by<br>
comparing a sequence number of the received RTP packet with a sequence<br>
number of a previously received packet. In step 906, the Terminal 303 records in<br>
a measurementEndRTPTimestamp a timestamp of the packet received in step<br>
901, and separately records a sequence number as well. In step 907, the Terminal<br>
303 calculates the total number of packets that it should have received for the<br>
entire session, and records it in an expectedTotalPackets. The value recorded in<br>
the expectedTotalPackets can be calculated depending on the RTP sequence<br>
number of the packet received at a measurement start time and the RTP sequence<br>
number of the last packet. Thereafter, in step 908, the Terminal 303 calculates a<br>
reception ratio depending on a ratio of the expectedTotalPackets to the<br>
receivedTotalPackets, and calculates a loss ratio depending on a ratio of the<br>
expectedTotalPackets to the lostTotalPackets. In step 909, the Terminal 303<br>
compares the loss ratio calculated in step 908 with the trigger value set in step<br>
900. If the loss ratio is less than the trigger value, the Terminal 303 returns to<br>
step 901 because there is no need to make a report. However, if it is determined<br>
in step 909 that the loss ratio is greater than the trigger value, the Terminal 303,<br>
because there is a need for the reception ratio report, proceeds to step 409 where<br>
it sends a reception ratio report message including the reception ratio. If the<br>
Terminal 303 ends the session before the session expires, the Terminal 303<br>
generates and sends a reception ratio report message based on the information up<br>
to the end time. When the Terminal 303 sets both the trigger value and the<br>
threshold of FIGs. 8 and 9 as the loss ratio, the procedure of FIG. 8 repeatedly<br>
measures and sends the reception ratio if the measured loss ratio is greater than<br>
the threshold, whereas the procedure of FIG. 9 measures and sends the reception<br>
ratio only once when the loss ratio is greater than the trigger value. Although the<br>
trigger value is set as a predetermined loss ratio, to be compared with the loss<br>
ratio, other values can be set according to such variables as system operator,<br>
reception ratio, reception quality and base station characteristics.<br>
FIGs. 10A and 10B illustrate a BSDA's operation of sending a reception<br>
ratio report indication message for a streaming service to a terminal and<br>
receiving a response message thereto in a broadcasting system according to a the<br>
present invention.<br><br>
In step 1000 of FIG. 10A, a BSDA 300 determines that there is a need<br>
for a reception ratio report on a particular service. In step 1001, the BSDA 300<br>
determines detailed reception ratio measurement types for the reception ratio<br>
report. As described above, there are a total of five reception ratio measurement<br>
types, each of which being described in FIGs. 4 to 9. In steps 1010 to 1050, the<br>
BSDA 300, when the reception ratio measurement type is determined in step<br>
1001, designates major items to be included in each reception ratio report<br>
indication message.<br>
In step 1010, the BSDA 300 designates SessionMeasurement in a<br>
reception ratio report indication message so as to measure a reception ratio in<br>
units of sessions designated in step 1001. In step 1020, the BSDA 300 designates<br>
FixedDurationMeasurement in the reception ratio report indication message so<br>
as to measure a reception ratio for the duration designated in step 1001. In step<br>
1001, if the BSDA 300 has failed to designate the reception ratio measurement<br>
type, it can perform end processing due to operation error as shown in FIG. 10B,<br>
or can designate a reception ratio measurement type according to a<br>
predetermined default measurement type among the foregoing five measurement<br>
types. Although this embodiment prepares multiple measurement types and<br>
designates one of the measurement types, the operation of step 1001 can be<br>
omitted when there is a single measurement type predefined between the BSDA<br>
300 and the Terminal 303.<br>
In steps 1021 and 1022. the BSDA 300 designates a measurement<br>
interval for measuring a packet reception ratio so as to support the measurement<br>
of step 1020. That is, BSDA 300 designates a measurement start time in step<br>
1021, and designates a measurement end time in step 1022. The measurement<br>
start time and the measurement end time are designated in the same form so that<br>
they can be compared with an RTP timestamp. In step 1030, the BSDA 300<br>
designates IntervalMeasurement in the reception ratio report indication message<br>
so as to measure a reception ratio every interval designated in step 1001. In step<br>
1031, the BSDA 300 designates an interval for the reception ratio report so as to<br>
support the measurement of step 1030. The interval herein is designated on the<br>
basis of the number of RTP packets.<br><br>
In step 1040, the BSDA 300 designates ThresholdMeasurement in the<br>
reception ratio report indication message so as to measure and report a reception<br>
ratio when a loss ratio is greater than a particular threshold designated in step<br>
1001.	In step 1041, the BSDA 300 designates a threshold so as to support the<br>
measurement of step 1040. The threshold herein is designated in percentage as it<br>
indicates a desired loss ratio to be compared with the loss ratio measured by the<br>
Terminal 303. In step 1050, if the loss ratio is greater than the trigger value in<br>
step 1001, the BSDA 300 designates EventTriggeredMeasurement in the<br>
reception ratio report indication message so as to continuously measure and<br>
report the reception ratio until the end time of the service the Terminal 303<br>
receives. In step 1051, the BSDA 300 designates a trigger value so as to support<br>
the measurement of step 1050. The trigger value herein is designated in<br>
percentage as it indicates a desired loss ratio to be compared with the loss ratio.<br>
If one of the five reception ratio measureme'nt types is determined and<br>
values of the measurement support items are also determined in the foregoing<br>
process, the Terminal 303 generates a reception ratio report indication message<br>
in step 1002. If the reception ratio report indication message is generated in step<br>
1002,	the BSDA 300 allows the generated message to interact with an Access<br>
fragment 231 of a service guide in step 1003 of FIG. 10B so that the terminals<br>
can acquire the message. In step 1003, the interaction with the Access fragment<br>
231 is achieved by registering in a URI attribute an address with which the<br>
terminals can receive the generated message. In step 1004, the BSDA 300<br>
broadcasts the access fragment interacted in step 1003, along with the service<br>
guide. In step 1005, the BSDA 300 receives the service guide and the Access<br>
fragment 231, accesses the BSDA 300 using an address in the URI, and sends a<br>
reception ratio report indication message to the Terminal 303 that has requested<br>
the reception ratio report indication message. In step 1006, the BSDA 300<br>
receives reception ratio report messages from the terminals that have performed<br>
the reception ratio measurement. In step 1007, the BSDA 300 sends an ACK for<br>
the reception ratio report message to the terminals. The operation of step 1007 is<br>
optional. Finally, in step 1008, the BSDA 300 classifies and analyzes the<br>
reception ratio report messages received from the Terminal 303.<br>
Fig. 11 is a block diagram illustrating a structure of a terminal according<br>
to the present invention.<br>
A receiver (303a) according to an embodiment of the present invention<br><br>
receives a reception ratio report indication message indicating at least one<br>
measurement type of a reception ratio for a broadcast streaming service.<br>
A controller (303c) analyzes the reception ratio report indication<br>
message received by the receiver (303a) and measures a reception ratio<br>
indicative of a ratio of an expectedTotalPackets indicating a total number of<br>
packets that the terminal expects to receive for a reception ratio measurement<br>
interval according to a reception ratio measurement type indicated by the<br>
reception ratio report indication message, to a receivedTotalPackets indicating a<br>
total number of packets that the terminal has received for the reception ratio<br>
measurement interval. In this case, the reception ratio measurement type<br>
