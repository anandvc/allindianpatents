				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
CYCLIC AMINE COMPOUND <br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to novel cyclic amine compounds and pest control agents<br>
' containing the compounds as active ingredients.<br>
The present invention claims priority on Japanese Patent Application No.<br>
2004-106668 filed on March 31, 2004 and on Japanese Patent Application No.<br>
2004-374007 filed on December 24,2004, the content of which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Although many insecticides and acaricides have been conventionally used, it<br>
was difficult to view them as satisfactory control agents in view of their inadequate effects,<br>
resistance problems limiting their use, possibilities of causing chemical injuries or<br>
pollution on plants, or high toxicity on humans, beasts, fishes, and the like, which are<br>
considerable. Therefore, it is required to develop agents having few such problems and<br>
being safely useable.<br>
Although a chemical compound having a backbone similar to that of the<br>
compound of the present invention is described as an antivirus agent in European Patent<br>

8-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octanoic ring (hereinafter referred to as tropane ring),<br>
3-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octanoic ring (hereinafter referred to as isotropane ring),<br>
3-azabicyclo[3.3.]nonane, and the like.<br>
Moreover, chemical compounds produced by oxidization of nitrogen atoms of<br>
the pyridine rings, or nitrogen atoms of cyclic amine portions of the piperidine rings,<br>
tropane rings, isotropane rings, or the like, of the present chemical compounds [I], exist,<br><br><br>
and all of these N-oxides are also included within the scope of this invention.<br>
When both R3 and R4 or both R5 and R6 of the chemical compound [1] of the<br>
present invention are together to form a saturated ring, two kinds of isomers such as<br>
shown in the following examples respectively exist. These isomers are unexceptionally<br>
intended to be within the scope of the present invention.<br><br>
Next, methods of producing the chemical compounds of the present invention<br><br>
will be explained. In the first place, a method of producing an intermediate (3) will be<br>
explained.<br><br>
(in the formula, R1 to R7, R31, R41, R51, R61, m and n represent the same meanings as those<br>
in the formula [I], X1 and X2 each independently represents a hydroxyl group or a thiol, X3<br>
represents an eliminated group such as a halogen atom or the like, X4 represents an<br>
oxygen atom or a sulfur atom, and R represents any one of a 2-pyridyl group, a methyl<br>
group, and a benzyl group, which are substituted by R2k).<br>
As shown in the reaction formula (III), the intermediate (3) can be produced by<br>
a conventional dehydration reaction, such as, for example, Mitsunobu reaction (which is<br>
described in, for example, Tetrahedron Lett., 1978, 2243, J. Org. Chem., 50, 3095, 1985,<br>
or the like), between the chemical compound (1) and the chemical compound (2). The<br>
chemical compound (1) can be produced according to a known method (which is<br>
described in, for example, "The Chemistry of Phenols," Eds. Z. Rappoport, J.Wiley (2003),<br>
Part 1, pp 395, or the like).<br>
Alternatively, the intermediate (3) can also be produced by coupling between an<br><br><br>
arylhalide (4) and the chemical compound (2), as shown in the reaction formula (IV).<br>
Specifically, it can be produced according to a known method (which is described in, for<br>
example, Synth. Cornmun., 1984,14, 621; J.Org. Chem., 48, 3771 (1983); J. Med. Chem.,<br>
17, 1000 (1974), or the like).<br>
Examples of bases which can be used in this case may include alkali metal<br>
hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, and the like, carbonates such<br>
as sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, and the like, metal alkoxides such as sodium<br>
methoxide, potassium t-butoxide, magnesium ethoxide, and the like, organic metals such<br>
as n-butylithium, LDA, and the like, metal hydrides such as sodium hydride, potassium<br>
hydride, and the like, organic bases such as triethylamine, diisopropylamine, pyridine, and<br>
the like. This reaction can be carried out in the presence of solvents or in the absence of<br>
solvents. The solvents which can be used are not particularly limited, provided that they<br>
are chemically stable solvents, and examples thereof may include hydrocarbon base<br>
solvents such as pentane, hexane, heptane, benzene, toluene, xylene, and the like, halogen<br>
base solvents such as dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, chloroform, carbon<br>
tetrachloride, and the like, nitrile base solvents such as acetonitrile, propionitrile, and the<br>
like, ether base solvents such as diethylether, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, and the like,<br>
aprotic polar solvents such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylsulfoxide<br>
(DMSO), and the like, and mixed solvents containing two or more kinds of these solvents.<br>
The reaction can be carried out at an optional temperature within a range from -78 °C to<br>
the boiling point of the used solvent.<br>
When R of the chemical compound (2) is a 2-pyridyl group substituted by R2<br>
(Chemical compound (7)), the chemical compound [I] can be directly produced according<br>
to the reaction formula (III) or the reaction formula (IV).<br>
As shown in the reaction formula (V), the chemical compound (7) can be<br>
synthesized by coupling between amine (5) and 2-halopyridine (6). Specifically, it can<br>
be produced according to a known method (which is described in, for example, Synthesis,<br>
1981, 606; J. Chem. Soc, C, 3693 (1971), or the like).<br><br><br>
(In the formula, R2 to R7, R31, R41, R51, R61, n, X2, and X3 represents the same meanings as<br>
those described above.)<br>
By way of contrast, when R of the chemical compound (2) is a methyl group or<br>
a benzyl group, the intermediate (3) produced by the reaction formula (III) or the reaction<br>
formula (IV) should be demethylated or debenzylated. The demethylation can be carried<br>
out according to a known method (which is described in, for example, Tetrahedron Lett.,<br>
1974, 1325; ibid., 1977,1565; ibid., 1995, 8867, or the like). Moreover, the<br>
debenzylation may be carried out by using a known hydrogenation. As shown in the<br>
reaction formula (VI), the chemical compound [I'] of the present invention can be<br>
produced by producing an intermediate (8) from the intermediate (3), followed by<br>
coupling it with 2-halopyridine (6). The specific method of this coupling is the same as<br>
that of the reaction formula (V).<br><br><br>
As the chemical compound (2) (in which R is a methyl group or a benzyl group),<br>
commercial products may be directly used. The intermediate (8) may exist alone as an<br>
amine, or may form a salt together with hydrochloric acid, acetic acid, or the like.<br>
After an end of the abovementioned condensation reaction, purification of the<br>
obtained product may be carried out, if needed, according to a known conventional<br>
method such as distillation, recrystallization, column chromatography, or the like.<br>
The chemical compounds of the present invention (the chemical compounds<br>
represented by the formula [I], the salts, or the N-oxides thereof) may be used for<br>
controlling agricultural pests, sanitary pest insects, stored grain pest insects, cloth pest<br>
insects, house pest insects and the like, and have activities of killing adults, nymphs,<br>
larvae and eggs. Their representative examples are shown in the following.<br>

In the recent time, various pest insects, such as diamond-back moths,<br>
planthoppers, leafhoppers, aphids, and the like, have developed resistance against<br>
organophosphorous insecticides, carbamate insecticides, acaricides, or the like.<br>
Therefore, the foresaid insecticides and acaricides have lost their efficacies against the<br>
pest insects and mites those which have developed resistance against them. Accordingly,<br>
there has been a desire for chemicals effective on pest insects and mites of the resistance<br>
strains. The compounds of the present invention are chemicals having excellent<br>
insecticidal and acaricidal effects on pest insects resistant to organophosphorous pesticides,<br>
carbamate insecticides or pyrethroid pesticides and mites resistant to acaricides, as well as<br>
those of sensitive strains.<br>
The compounds of the present invention induce very slight phytotoxicity on<br>
plants, have low toxicity on fishes and warm-blood animals, and are highly safe.<br>
Further, the compounds of the present invention can be used also as an<br>
anti-fouling agent that prevents aqueous adhesive organisms from adhering to structures<br>
placed in water such as the outer bottom of a vessel and fishing nets.<br>
The chemical compounds of the present invention may have germicidal<br>
activities, weeding activities, or plant controlling effects. Moreover, the intermediate<br>
chemical compounds of the chemical compounds of the present invention may have<br>
activities of killing insects or mites.<br>
Insecticides and acaricides of the present invention include at least one kind of<br>
the chemical compounds of the present invention as their active ingredients. Although<br>
the chemical compounds of the present invention may be directly used without adding<br>
other constituents, they are generally used by mixing them with solid carriers, liquid<br><br><br>
carriers, or gaseous carriers, or by immersing them in substrates such as porousceramic<br>
plates, nonwoven fabrics, or the like, followed by adding surfactants or other adjuvants, if<br>
needed, to formulate them, for using as agrichemicals, in forms of conventional<br>
agrichemicals, that is, water dispersible powders, granules, dusting powders, emulsions,<br>
water soluble powders, suspensions, granular water dispersible powders, floables, aerosols,<br>
aerosols, heat-transpiration agents, fumigants, poison baits, microcapsules, or the like.<br>

as soy bean grains, wheats, or the like, mineral impalpable powders such as diatomites,<br>
apatites, gypsums, talcs, bentonites, pyrophyllites, clays, or the like, organic or inorganic<br>
chemical compounds such as benzoates of soda, ureas, mirabilites, or the like, can be used<br>
as the additives or the carriers. When the chemical compounds are used as liquid agents,<br>
petroleum fractions such as kerosenes, xylenes, and solvent naphthas, or the like,<br>
cyclohexanes, cyclohexanons, dimethylformamides, dimethylsulfoxides, alcohols,<br>
acetones, methyl isobutylketons, mineral oils, vegetable oils, water, or the like, can be<br>
used as solvents. As the gaseous carriers used for propellants, butane gases, LPG,<br>
dimethyl ethers, or carbonic acid gases can be use.<br>
As substrates for the poison baits, bait constituents such as, for example, cereal<br>
powders, vegitable oils, sugars, crystalline celluloses, or the like, antioxidants such as<br>
dibutylhydroxytoluene, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, or the like, preservatives such as<br>
dehydroacetic acid, or the like, agents for preventing children or pets from eating them by<br>
mistake, such as powdered capsicums or the like, or flavors for attracting pest insects,<br>
such as cheese flavors, onion flavors, or the like, can be used.<br>
If needed, surfactants may be added to these formulations so as to form their<br>
uniform and stable conformations. Although there is no limitations on the surfactants,<br>
their examples include nonionic surfactants such as alkyl ethers added with<br>
polyoxyethylenes, higher fatty acid esters added with polyoxyethylenes, sorbitan higher<br>
fatty acid esters added with polyoxyethylenes, tristyrylphenyl ethers added with<br>
polyoxyethylenes, and the like, sulfuric ester salts of alkylphenylethers added with<br>
