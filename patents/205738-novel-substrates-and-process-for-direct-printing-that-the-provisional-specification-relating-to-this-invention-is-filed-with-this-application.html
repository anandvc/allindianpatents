FIELD OF   INVENTION<br>
 This invention relates to a substrate for ink jet printing with hydrophobic<br>
solvent based ink.<br>
This invention also relates to a process for ink jet printing with hydrophobic solvent based ink on a substrate.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Ink jet printing is carried out with aqueous or solvent based inks. If textile substrates such as woven or non-woven fabrics or cloths or jute or blends thereof which are meshed or perforated by the very nature thereof or non-textile substrates such as plastics sheets which are meshed or perforated, are directly ink jet printed, the ink seeps through the substrates due to the perforations or gaps in such substrates resulting in poor quality printed images besides other disadvantages such as wastage of inks.<br>
US Patent No 4,725,849 describes a process for ink jet printing cloth using aqueous inks, wherein prior to printing, the cloth is coated with a layer of water soluble or hydrophilic resin containing solution which is moist and has<br>
a viscosity of 1000 - 1500 cp at 25°C. The ink receiving layer absorbs the<br><br>
ink quickly and prevents feathering and seepage of the ink through the perforations or gaps of the substrate. The ink is fixed on the substrate by ironing followed by removing the ink receiving layer with a neutral detergent and drying the printed substrate.<br>
The ink receiving layer is formed by dissolving or dispersing one or more polymers in a solvent such as water. The polymers include compounds such as water soluble or hydrophilic resins which may be natural or synthetic, such as albumin, gelatin, casein, starch, cationic starch, gum arabic or sodium alignate or water soluble polyamide, polyacrylamide, polyvinylpyrrolidone, quaternary salts of polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyethyleneimine, polyvinylpyridinium halides, melamine resin, polyurethane, corboxymethylcellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, cation-modified polyvinyl alcohol, water soluble polyester or poly(sodium acrylate). For the purpose of reinforcing the ink receiving material and/or enhancing its adhesion to the substrate there may optionally be used jointly a resin such as latex, polyvinyl formal, polymethylmethacrylate, polyvinyl-butyral, polyacrylonitrile, polyvinyl-chloride, polyvinyl-acetate, phenolic resin, or alkyd resin.<br><br>
Good quality images are reported to have been printed with the above process. Besides, porosity and breathability of the printed substrate is restored due to removal of the ink receiving layer. Because of the ironing step, the process is, however, time consuming and tedious to carry out and it is also energy consuming.<br>
US Patent No 6291023 teaches the use of a coating composition on textile substrates so as to improve the quality of printing thereon generally by employing ink jet printing with aqueous inks. The coating composition consisits of a mixture of  azetiddinium and guanidine polymers, a copolymer of azetidiniurn and guanidine monomers and a poly ( amino amide) -epichlorohydrin resin. The coating composition continues to remain on the substrates after the printing thereby rendering the substrate non-porous and non-breathable. Besides the coating composition is expensive.<br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
An object of the invention is to provide a substrate for ink jet printing with hydrophbic_Solvent based ink which gives good printed images with breathability to the substrate.<br><br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a process of ink jet printing with hydrophobic solvent based ink on a substrate, which gives good printed images with breathability to the substrate.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a process of ink jet printing with hydrophobic solvent based ink on a substrate, which is simple, convenient and less time consuming to carry out.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a process of ink jet printing with hydrophobic solvent based ink on a substrate, which is less energy consuming and is economical.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the invention there is provided a substrate for ink jet printing with hydrophobic solvent based inks comprising a meshed member laminated on one side thereof with a water soluble film having a thickness in the range of 5 to 100 microns, the ink jet printing with hydrophobic solvent based ink being carried out on the opposite unlaminated side of the meshed  member.<br><br>
The meshed member may be textile materials such as woven or non-woven fabrics or cloths or polyester or jute or hessian or blends thereof. Alternatively, the meshed member may be non - textile materials such as meshed or perforated plastic sheets. <br>
The water soluble film may have any thickness that is sufficient to prevent seepage of inks. Preferably, the water soluble film is of 10 to 75 microns in thickness and still preferably between 15 to 50 microns in thickness.<br>
According to the invention there is also provided a process for ink jet printing with hydrophobic solvent based ink on a substrate comprising first laminating a meshed member on one side thereof with a water soluble film having a thickness in the range of 5 to 100 microns so as to form the substrate followed by ink jet printing the substrate with hydrophobic  solvent based ink on the opposite unlaminated side thereof and washing and drying the printed substrate.<br>
•The meshed substrate is laminated with the water soluble film on one side thereof by  any known method such as heat or wet sealing or using water<br><br><br>
soluble adhesives such as poly vinyl acetate derivatives, acrylic derivatives, guar gum or carboxymethylcellulose or gelatin glues.<br>
The water soluble film may be cold or hot water soluble and may be made of acrylic acid polymers, acrylic ester polymers, acrylic acid copolymers, acrylic ester copolymers, polymers of acrylic acids and esters, cross linked polyvinyl alcohols, cross linked cellulose derivatives, ethyl cellulose, nitrocellulose, cellulose butyrate, cellulose acetate butyrate, ethylene vinyl polyalcohol, ethylene vinyl acetate, acrylic emulsion, polyvinylchloride emulsion, polyvinylidene dichloride emulsion, polyvinyl butyral, natural or synthetic waxes, polyurethanes, modified polyvinyl alcohols or silicone based polymers.<br>
According to the invention there is also provided printed substrate obtained by the process described above.<br>
During printing due to lamination of the meshed member the perforations or gaps in the meshed member are plugged by the water soluble film. Therefore the ink does not flow through the perforations or gaps and result in wastage.<br>
At the same time due to the hydrophobic nature of the solvent based ink, it<br><br><br>
does not get absorbed by the water soluble film thereby facilitating absorption of the entire ink by the meshed member thereby ensuring high quality printed images on the meshed member.<br>
Ink jet printing may be carried out on the substrate immediately after lamination or after a storage period.<br>
The following experimental examples are illustrative of the invention but not   limitative of the scope thereof.<br>
Example 1 100% Cotton cloth (10 M x 1 M) was laminated on one side thereof with a water soluble film of 20 microns thickness ( being sold by us under the brand name EC 200 WSF) by heat sealing to from the substrate which was printed on the opposite unlaminated side thereof using an ink jet printer Vutek -USA using a hydrophobic solvent based ink (Vutek of Vutek- USA). The printed substrate was washed with water and dried with a hot air drier.<br><br><br>
Example 2 100% Cotton cloth (10 M x 1 M) was laminated on one side thereof with a water soluble film of 25 microns thickness ( being sold by us under the brand name EC 250 WSF) by wet sealing to form the substrate which was printed on the opposite unlaminated side thereof using an ink jet printer Vutek -USA using a hydrophobic solvent based ink (Vutek of Vutek -USA). The printed substrate was washed with water and dried with a hot air drier.<br>
Example 3 Perforated polyvinyl chloride sheet (5 M x 1M) was laminated on one side thereof with a water soluble film of 15 microns thickness (being sold by us under the brand name EC 150 WSF) using water soluble adhesive (Fevicol of Parekh Industries, Mumbai) to form the substrate which was printed on the opposite unlaminated side thereof using an ink jet printer Vutek -USA using a hydrophobic solvent based ink (Vutek of Vutek- USA). The printed substrate was washed with an aqueous solution of Surf Excel (detergent) of Hindustan Lever Ltd, Mumbai followed by drying with a hot air drier.<br><br><br>
The density of colours of the printed substrates remained the same before and after the substrates were washed thereby giving fast and high quality printed images. Besides the porosity and breathability of the substrates were restored after the film was washed off. Porosity of the substrates gives transparency to them and adds to the brightness and clarity of the printed images. Breathability of the substrates also gives comfort to the users, say in the forms of printed garments, bedspreads, towels, pillow covers or the like. The process of the invention is simple, easy and convenient to carry out in that the method of fixing the film to the meshed member is easy, simple and convenient to carry out and the process also eliminates the ironing step. Due to elimination of the ironing step the process consumes less energy and is economical.<br><br><br>
