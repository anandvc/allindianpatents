				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to an aluminium alloy for producing<br>
lithographic printing plate supports as well as an aluminium<br>
strip produced from the aluminium alloy, a method for<br>
producing the aluminium strip and use thereof to produce<br>
lithographic printing plate supports.<br>
Aluminium strips for the production of lithographic printing<br>
plate supports must be of very high quality and are therefore<br>
subject to constant development. The aluminium strip must<br>
satisfy a complex profile of properties. The aluminium strip<br>
is thus subjected to electrochemical roughening during the<br>
production of the lithographic printing plate support, which<br>
roughening process has to ensure an unstructured appearance<br>
without streaking effects at maximum processing speed. The<br>
purpose of the roughened structure of the aluminium strip is<br>
to enable photosensitive layers, which are then illuminated,<br>
to be permanently applied to the printing plate support. The<br>
photolayers are burned in at temperatures of 220 °C to 300 °C<br>
over a period of 3 to 10 min. Typical combinations of<br>
burning-in times and temperatures are, for example, 240 °C<br>
for 10 min or 280 °C for 4 min. It must then also be possible<br>
to easily handle the printing plate support so as to enable a<br>
clamping of the printing plate support in the printing<br>
device. The softening of the printing plate support after the<br>
burning-in process may therefore not be too pronounced. A<br>
maximum tensile strength before the burning-in process may<br>
ensure that the tensile strength after the burning-in process<br>
is sufficiently high. However, a high tensile strength before<br>
the burning-in process hinders the alignment of the aluminium<br>
strip, that is to say the elimination of a "coil-set" of the<br>
aluminium strip before the processing to form the printing<br>
plate support. In addition, printing machines with maximum<br>
printing areas are increasingly used, and therefore printing<br>
plate supports no longer have to be clamped lengthwise to the<br>
 <br>
rolling direction, but transverse to the rolling direction so<br>
as to provide extra-large printing widths. This means that<br>
the flexural fatigue strength of the printing plate support<br>
is increasingly important transverse to the rolling<br>
direction. In order to optimise the properties of the<br>
aluminium strip in terms of its capacity for roughening, its<br>
heat resistance, mechanical properties before and after the<br>
burning-in process as well as its flexural fatigue strength<br>
lengthwise to the rolling direction, a strip for producing<br>
lithographic printing plate supports which is characterised<br>
by a good capacity for roughening combined with a high<br>
flexural fatigue strength lengthwise to the rolling direction<br>
and sufficient thermal stability is known from European<br>
patent EP 1.065 071 B1, which originates from the applicant.<br>
Owing to the increasing size of the printing machines and the<br>
resultant enlargement of the printing plate supports<br>
required, however, it has become necessary to improve the<br>
properties of the aluminium alloys and the printing plate<br>
supports produced therefrom in terms of softening transverse<br>
to the rolling direction without negatively influencing the<br>
capacity for roughening of the aluminium strip.<br>
It is also known from international patent application WO<br>
2007/045676, which also originates from the applicant, to<br>
combine high iron contents 0.4 % by weight to 1 % by weight<br>
with a relatively high manganese content and with magnesium<br>
contents of up to 0.3 % by weight at most. Heat resistance<br>
and flexural fatigue strength lengthwise to the rolling<br>
direction after a burning-in process could be improved using<br>
this aluminium alloy. However, it was previously assumed that<br>
in particular manganese and magnesium contents of more than<br>
0.3 % by weight are problematic in terms of the capacity of<br>
the aluminium alloy for roughening.<br>
Based on this, the object underlying the present invention is<br>
to provide an aluminium alloy and an aluminium strip which<br>
 <br>
enable the production of printing plate supports having<br>
improved flexural fatigue strength transverse to the rolling<br>
direction and having improved heat resistance, without<br>
impairing the roughening properties. At the same time, the<br>
present invention is based on the problem of providing a<br>
production method for an aluminium strip which is well<br>
adapted in particular for the production of lithographic<br>
printing plate supports which are to be clamped transversely.<br>
In accordance with a first teaching of the present invention<br>
the above-described object of an aluminium alloy for<br>
producing lithographic printing plate supports is achieved in<br>
that the aluminium allow contains the following alloy<br>
components, in % by weight:<br>
0.2% ≤ Fe	≤	0.5%,<br>
0.11 % ≤ Mg	≤	0.7 %,<br>
0.05 % ≤ Si	≤	0.25 %,<br>
0.31 % ≤ Mn	≤	0.6 %,<br>
Cu	≤	0.04 %,<br>
Ti	≤	0.1 %,<br>
Zn	≤	0.1 %,<br>
Cr	≤	0.1 %,<br>
the rest being Al and unavoidable impurities, each in an<br>
amount of 0.05 % at most to give a total of 0.15 % at most.<br>
In contrast to the previously used aluminium alloys for<br>
production of lithographic printing plate supports, which<br>
contain very low proportions of manganese and magnesium on<br>
the whole, the present aluminium alloy according to the<br>
invention combines high manganese contents of at least 0.31 %<br>
by weight with relatively high magnesium contents of 0.1 to<br>
0.7 % by weight. As a result, it has been found that the<br>
aluminium alloy according to the invention not only exhibits<br>
very good flexural fatigue strength transverse to the rolling<br>
 <br>
direction owing to the combination of high manganese and<br>
magnesium contents. Owing to excellent heat resistance, the<br>
printing plate supports produced from the aluminium alloy<br>
according to the invention can be easily handled, and process<br>
reliability during the production process to ensure the<br>
mechanical properties before and after the burning-in process<br>
is particularly high. In spite of the permissible high<br>
manganese and magnesium values, experts have not encountered<br>
any problem in terms of capacity for roughening, contrary to<br>
expectations.<br>
Good roughening behaviour is also produced by silicon, which<br>
is contained in the aluminium alloy according to the<br>
invention in an amount of 0.05 % by weight to 0.25 % by<br>
weight. During electrochemical roughening or etching, the Si<br>
content according to the invention ensures that a high number<br>
of sufficiently deep recesses are produced so as to guarantee<br>
optimal absorption of the photosensitive varnish.<br>
Copper should be limited to a maximum of 0.04 % by weight so<br>
as to avoid inhomogeneous structures during the roughening<br>
process. Titanium, which is introduced into the aluminium<br>
alloy for grain refinement of the melt, leads to problems<br>
during roughening at higher contents of more than 0.1 % by<br>
weight. The contents of zinc and chromium have a negative<br>
effect on the roughening result and should therefore be<br>
present in an amount of 0.1 % by weight at most.<br>
In accordance with a first embodiment of the aluminium alloy<br>
according to the invention, the heat resistance of the<br>
aluminium alloy can be further increased since the aluminium<br>
alloy contains the following Mn content in % by weight:<br>
0.5 % ≤ Mn ≤ 0.6 %.<br>
 <br>
It has also been found that higher manganese contents do not<br>
only lead to further improvement of heat resistance, that is<br>
to say to lesser softening after a burning-in process, but<br>
simultaneously stabilise the flexural fatigue strength<br>
transverse to the rolling direction with regard to the<br>
selected production method. This effect is particularly<br>
pronounced with a manganese content of 0.5 % to 0.6 % by<br>
weight.<br>
In accordance with a next embodiment of the aluminium alloy<br>
according to the invention, said alloy has an Mg content in %<br>
by weight of:<br>
0.5 % ≤ Mg ≤ 0.7 %,<br>
and the flexural fatigue strength transverse to the rolling<br>
direction can thus be increased once again. No problems in<br>
terms of the capacity for electrochemical roughening of the<br>
aluminium strips produced from a corresponding aluminium<br>
alloy have been observed either with higher manganese<br>
contents, for example of at least 0.5 % by weight, or in<br>
combination with magnesium contents of at least 0.5 % by<br>
weight.<br>
As already mentioned, Ti, Zn and Cr may negatively affect the<br>
roughening result and in principle may lead to streaking<br>
effects on the aluminium strips. The aluminium alloy<br>
according to the invention may thus be improved further in<br>
terms of process reliability during roughening, and therefore<br>
with regard to the use thereof for printing plate supports<br>
since the aluminium alloy contains the following alloy<br>
components in % by weight:<br>
Ti ≤ 0.05 %,<br>
Zn ≤ 0.05 %,<br>
Cr ≤ 0.01 %.<br>
 <br>
In accordance with a second teaching of the present<br>
invention, the above-mentioned object is achieved by an<br>
aluminium strip for producing lithographic printing plate<br>
supports consisting of an aluminium alloy according to the<br>
invention having a thickness of 0.15 mm to 0.5 mm. The<br>
aluminium strip according to the invention is characterised<br>
not only by its excellent capacity for roughening, but<br>
guarantees optimised handling ability with regard to the use<br>
of extra-large printing devices with transversely clamped<br>
printing plate supports owing to the very good heat<br>
resistance with moderate tensile strength values. Above all,<br>
the excellent flexural fatigue strength transverse to the<br>
rolling direction of the aluminium strip according to the<br>
invention adds to this.<br>
In accordance with a further embodiment of the aluminium<br>
strip according to the invention, after a burning-in process<br>
at a temperature of 280 oC and for a period of 4 min, said<br>
strip has a tensile strength Rm of more than 150 MPa, a proof<br>
stress Rp 0.2 of more than 140 MPa and a flexural fatigue<br>
strength transverse to the rolling direction of at least 1950<br>
cycles in a flexural fatigue test. Since the aluminium strip<br>
according to the invention exhibits very good heat<br>
resistance, it is possible to adjust the tensile strength<br>
values before the burning-in process in an ideal processing<br>
range using conventional method parameters, for example so as<br>
to correct a "coil set" and at the same time to enable<br>
excellent handling ability and stability during use in extra-<br>
large printing devices.<br>
Owing to the above-described property profile of the<br>
aluminium alloy and the aluminium strips produced therefrom,<br>
in accordance with a third teaching of the present invention<br>
the above-mentioned object is also achieved by the use of the<br>
 <br>
aluminium strip according to the invention to produce<br>
lithographic printing plate supports.<br>
Lastly, in accordance with a fourth teaching of the present<br>
invention, the above-mentioned object is achieved by a method<br>
for producing an aluminium strip for lithographic printing<br>
plate supports consisting of an aluminium alloy according to<br>
the invention in that a rolled ingot is cast, the rolled<br>
ingot is optionally homogenised at a temperature of 450 °C to<br>
610 °C, the rolled ingot is hot-rolled to a thickness of 2 to<br>
9 mm and the hot-rolled strip is cold-rolled, either with or<br>
without intermediate annealing, to a final thickness of 0.15<br>
mm to 0.5 mm. The intermediate annealing process, if<br>
intermediate annealing is carried out, is conducted in such a<br>
way that a desired final strength of the aluminium strip in<br>
the final rolled state is set by the subsequent cold-rolling<br>
process carried out to a final thickness.<br>
An intermediate annealing is preferably carried out at an<br>
intermediate thickness of 0.5 to 2.8 mm, wherein the<br>
intermediate annealing is carried out in the coil or in a<br>
continuous furnace at a temperature of 230 °C to 470 °C. As a<br>
result of this intermediate annealing, the final strength of<br>
the aluminium strip in the final rolled state can be adjusted<br>
depending on the thickness of the strip at which the<br>
intermediate annealing is carried out. A concluding annealing<br>
process can preferably be omitted so as to keep production<br>
costs as low as possible.<br>
Owing to the aluminium alloy according to the invention, in<br>
conjunction with the parameters just described, the flexural<br>
fatigue strength transverse to the rolling direction is very<br>
high, and at the same time a softening of the aluminium strip<br>
caused by the compulsory burning-in process is reduced. As a<br>
result, printing plate supports can be provided by the method<br>
according to the invention which, in addition to excellent<br>
 <br>
capacity for roughening, also combine excellent heat<br>
resistance with a high flexural fatigue strength transverse<br>
to the rolling direction.<br>
There are now a large number of possibilities for providing<br>
and developing the aluminium alloy according to the<br>
invention, the aluminium strip according to the invention,<br>
the use thereof and the method for producing the aluminium<br>
strip. For this purpose reference is made to the claims<br>
subordinate to claims 1, 6 and 9 and to the description of<br>
embodiments in conjunction with the drawings.<br>
The single figure of the drawing shows a schematic sectional<br>
view of the device used to determine the flexural fatigue<br>
strength.<br>
Table 1 now shows the alloy composition of a reference<br>
aluminium alloy Ref and aluminium alloys according to the<br>
invention 15, 16 and 17, which were also examined. The<br>
composition values in Table 1 are given in percent by weight.<br>
 <br>
The alloys 15, 16 and 17 according to the invention contain a<br>
much higher manganese content of 0.5 % by weight compared to<br>
the reference aluminium alloy. The Mg content was varied from<br>
0.2 % by weight to 0.6 % by weight. Rolled ingots were cast<br>
from the aluminium alloys having the compositions just<br>
mentioned. The rolled ingot was then homogenised at a<br>
 <br>
temperature of 450 °C to 610 °C and hot-rolled to a hot strip<br>
thickness of 4 mm. The col-rolling to a final thickness of<br>
0.3 mm was carried out both without and with intermediate<br>
annealing, wherein the intermediate annealing was carried out<br>
at a strip thickness of 0.9 to 1.2 mm, preferably at 1.1 mm.<br>
Two different temperature ranges were used during the<br>
intermediate annealing, specifically 300 °C to 350 °C and 400<br>
°C to 450 °C.<br>
The aluminium strips produced in accordance with the method<br>
just described were subjected to an electrochemical<br>
roughening in order to examine suitability for the production<br>
of printing plate supports. Surprisingly and contrary to the<br>
expectations of experts, no negative indications with regard<br>
to any streaking effects were observed after the roughening<br>
process, even with the relatively high magnesium and<br>
manganese contents of the aluminium alloys according to the<br>
invention. The aluminium alloys according to the invention<br>
are therefore all characterised by very good or good<br>
roughening behaviour. The results of the roughening tests are<br>
shown in Table 2.<br>
 <br>
Table 3 shows the results of the flexural fatigue test as<br>
well as the associated values for intermediate annealing<br>
thickness and the intermediate annealing temperature ranges.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
As Table 3 shows clearly, the number of possible bending<br>
cycles both in the final rolled state and in the burned-in<br>
state could be increased considerably compared to the<br>
reference alloy. At 2300 cycles, the minimal number of<br>
bending cycles transverse to the rolling direction in the<br>
burned-in state is 1.8 times higher than with the reference<br>
alloy. The aluminium alloy according to the invention is thus<br>
particularly well adapted for the production of extra-large<br>
printing plate supports which are clamped in printing devices<br>
transverse to the rolling direction.<br>
 <br>
An improved heat resistance was also produced with the high<br>
manganese contents, which was particularly noticeable in the<br>
form of higher values for tensile strength and proof stress.<br>
The mechanical properties of the alloy examples are given in<br>
Table 4. They were measured in accordance with the EN<br>
standard.<br>
 <br>
The influence of the intermediate annealing on the values Rm<br>
and Rp 0.2 is evident. The highest values for tensile<br>
strength Rm and proof stress Rp 0.2 can be found in tests<br>
5.1, 6.1 and 7.1. This is to be attributed to the production<br>
of the strips without intermediate annealing. The<br>
intermediate annealing at 0.9 mm to 1.2 mm, preferably at 1.1<br>
mm gave moderate values for tensile strength and proof stress<br>
after the burning-in process, wherein the values were reduced<br>
once again with increasing intermediate annealing<br>
 <br>
temperature, as demonstrated by practical examples 5.3, 6.3<br>
and 7.3.<br>
All measured values for tensile strength Rm and proof stress<br>
RP 0.2 of the aluminium strips according to the invention are<br>
considerably above the previously obtained values of the<br>
reference alloy in the test R, although a smaller thickness<br>
for the intermediate annealing was selected in the aluminium<br>
strips according to the invention at the same intermediate<br>
annealing temperature.<br>
Fig. la now shows a schematic view of the flexural fatigue<br>
device 1, which was used to determine the number of possible<br>
flexural fatigue cycles. The flexural fatigue device 1<br>
consists of a movable segment 3 which is arranged on a fixed<br>
segment 4 in such a way that the segment 3 is moved back and<br>
forth during the flexural fatigue test by a rolling movement<br>
over the fixed segment 4 so that the fixed sample 2 is<br>
subjected to bending at right angles to the extension of the<br>
sample, Fig. lb. In order to examine the flexural fatigue<br>
strength transverse to the rolling direction, a sample must<br>
be cut out from the aluminium strip according to the<br>
invention merely transverse to the rolling direction and<br>
clamped in the flexural fatigue device 1. The radius of the<br>
segments 3, 4 is 30 mm. The number of bending cycles was<br>
measured, wherein the bending cycle was terminated upon<br>
reaching the starting position of the segment 3.<br>
The measurements of the flexural fatigue strength of the<br>
alloys according to the invention clearly showed that the<br>
number of bending cycles can generally be increased with<br>
increased manganese and magnesium contents, wherein a high<br>
number of bending cycles was also achieved without<br>
intermediate annealing processes, until the sample cracked.<br>
In particular, the number of bending cycles achieved when<br>
 <br>
carrying out intermediate annealing in the final rolled state<br>
significantly approximated that achieved in the burned-in<br>
state with higher manganese and magnesium contents. In this<br>
regard a positive effect of the manganese and magnesium<br>
contents on the mechanical properties of the aluminium strips<br>
according to the invention could be observed.<br>

8. The method according to claim 7, characterised in that<br>
intermediate annealing is carried out at an intermediate<br>
thickness of 0.5 mm to 2.8 mm, preferably between 0.9 mm<br>
and 1.2 mm, and the intermediate annealing takes place in<br>
the coil or in a continuous furnace at a temperature of<br>
230 °C to 470 °C.<br>

The invention relates to an aluminium alloy for producing<br>
lithographic printing plate supports. The object of providing<br>
an aluminium alloy and an aluminium strip made of an aluminium<br>
alloy which make it possible to produce printing plate<br>
supports having improved flexural fatigue strength transverse<br>
to the rolling direction and having improved heat resistance,<br>
without impairing roughening properties, is achieved for an<br>
aluminium alloy in that the aluminium alloy contains the<br>
following alloy components in percent by weight:<br>
0.2% ≤ Fe ≤ 0.5%,<br>
0.41 % ≤ Mg ≤ 0.7 %,<br>
0.05 % ≤ Si ≤ 0.25 %,<br>
0.31 % ≤ Mn ≤ 0.6 %,<br>
Cu ≤ 0.04 %,<br>
Ti ≤ 0.1 %,<br>
Zn ≤ 0.1 %,<br>
Cr ≤ 0.1 %,<br>
the rest being Al and unavoidable impurities, each in an<br>
amount of 0.05 % at most to give a total of 0.15 % at most.</td>
