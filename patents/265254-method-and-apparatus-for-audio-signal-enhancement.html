5 	DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
		[0021] Disclosed herein is a method and apparatus for audio signal<br>
	enhancement. The method and apparatus utilize a microphone array comprising<br>
	angularly separated physical microphone elements that can be integrated into small<br>
	portable electronic devices such as portable communication devices. The method and<br>
10	 apparatus further utilize a mixture of linear and non-linear processing of audio signals<br>
	obtained from the microphone array to generate a directional audio signal with a<br>
	distortion that is low enough for the method and apparatus to be efficiently used in<br>
	intelligible speech communication.<br>
		[0022] One embodiment is a method for audio signal enhancement that<br>
	obtains a first audio signal from a first physical microphone element and obtains a<br>
	second audio signal from a second physical microphone element. The audio signals<br>
	are array processed to generate a virtual linear first order element and a virtual non-<br>
	linear even order element. The array processing includes combining the virtual linear<br>
	first order element and the virtual non-linear even order element to generate a<br>
	directional audio signal having a primary audio beam.<br>
		[0023] Another embodiment is an apparatus for audio signal enhancement.<br>
	The apparatus includes a first physical microphone element and a second physical<br>
	microphone element. A first divider scales an audio signal from the first physical<br>
	microphone element by a scaling factor and a second divider scales an audio signal<br>
	from the second physical microphone element by the scaling factor. A processor array<br>
	processes the scaled audio signals to generate a virtual linear first order element and a<br>
	virtual non-linear even order element, and combines the virtual linear first order<br>
	element and the virtual non-linear even order element to generate a directional audio<br>
	signal comprising a primary audio beam. A multiplier multiplies the directional audio<br>
	signal by the scaling factor to maintain an output level consistent with the input level<br>
	to the system.<br>

WO 2006/071405	PCT/US2005/042165<br>
		[0024] FIG. 1 is a block diagram of an apparatus 100 for audio signal<br>
	enhancement, in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. The apparatus<br>
	100 includes a first physical microphone element 102 and a second physical<br>
	microphone element 104. As described in further detail herein, more than two<br>
	microphone elements may be used. The output signals from the microphone elements<br>
	102 and 104 are provided to amplifiers 112 and 114, respectively, to calibrate the gain<br>
	of the microphone elements 102 and 104. The outputs of amplifiers 112 and 114 are<br>
	divided into time windows, and then provided to maximum signal detectors 122 and<br>
	124. The maximum signal detectors detect and hold the maximum signal output from<br>
	the amplifiers 112 and 114 for a given time window. The maximum signal detector<br>
	having the larger amplitude is selected at maximum signal selector 130. This signal is<br>
	then used as a scaling factor at dividers 132 and 134 to scale the output signals from<br>
	amplifiers 112 and 114. This processing normalizes the outputs of the amplifiers 112<br>
	and 114. The normalized microphone signals are then array processed by array<br>
	processor 140. The array processing is described in further detail herein. The<br>
	resultant of the array processing is then scaled through a multiplier 150 using the<br>
	same scaling factor employed at dividers 132 and 134. An audio signal enhancement<br>
	block 190, indicates the processing components that operate using time windows.<br>
		[0025] In embodiments of the invention, the distance separating the physical<br>
	microphone elements 102 and 104 is less than one-half of the wavelength of the<br>
	shortest wavelength of interest. For example, if the frequency is full-range audio (20-<br>
20	,000 Hz), then the shortest wavelength of interest is 17.3 millimeters. If the<br>
	frequency is telephone audio (300 - 3400 Hz) then the shortest wavelength is 100<br>
	millimeters.<br>
		[0026] Referring to FIG. 2, a flow diagram depicting a method for audio<br>
	signal enhancement within each time window or frame is illustrated. The first step, as<br>
	indicated by step 222, obtains audio signals from a microphone array, the microphone<br>
	array comprising two or more physical microphone elements 102 and 104. The audio<br>
	signals are then scaled at step 224 (e.g., by dividers 132 and 134). At step 226, the<br>
	audio signals are array processed to generate a virtual linear first order element and a<br>
	virtual non-linear even order element. The virtual linear first order element and the<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2006/071405	PCT/US2005/042165<br>
	virtual non-linear even order element are combined. The array processing is described<br>
	in further detail herein. Step 228 comprises scaling the audio signal, again, this time<br>
	performing the inverse operation as that performed in step 224, namely multiplying<br>
	the audio signal by the scaling factor (e.g., at multiplier 150). As indicated at step 230,<br>
	the resultant is a directional audio signal comprising a primary beam.<br>
		[0027] The processing of steps 222-230 may be performed by a processor<br>
	such as a general-purpose microprocessor executing code, a digital signal processor<br>
	(DSP), an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a combination of software,<br>
	hardware and/or firmware, etc. Thus, the term processor as used herein is intended to<br>
	have a broad meaning encompassing a variety of components for implementing the<br>
	described method.<br>
		[0028] The microphone array comprises first order directional elements or a<br>
	combination comprising first order directional elements and omnidirectional<br>
	elements. The first order directional elements are "non-dimentional." As used herein,<br>
	the term "non-dimentional" refers to physical microphone elements, which have a size<br>
	that is small compared to the wavelength of sound. This is typically achieved in a<br>
	single microphone capsule by introducing an acoustic delay element (e.g., a felt or<br>
	screen) in the rear path to the microphone's diaphragm. An angular response of a first<br>
	order directional element can be represented as P(ø) and is expressed as in equation<br>
	(1) where 0
	P(ø) = α+ (1- α) * Cosine(ø).<br>
		[0029] FIG. 3 illustrates an angular response 322 of a first order directional<br>
	element. As used herein, the first order directional elements include first order<br>
	cardioid elements, first order non-cardioid elements, as well as combinations<br>
	comprising at least one of the foregoing elements.<br>
		[0030] FIG. 4 illustrates an angular response 432 of a first order bi-directional<br>
	element. The virtual first order bi-directional element is generated when alpha has a<br>
	value of 0 in equation (1). The angular response 432 is a response that has equal<br>
	maximum angular response in both front and the rear directions.<br>
5<br><br>
WO 2006/071405	PCT/US2005/042165<br>
		[0031] FIG. 5 illustrates an angular response 542 of a omnidirectional<br>
	element. The virtual omnidirectional element is generated when alpha has a value of 1<br>
	in equation (1). The angular response 542 is a response that has equal angular<br>
	response in all the directions.<br>
		[0032] First order directional elements may be used to generate virtual first<br>
	order bi-directional elements and virtual omnidirectional elements. FIG. 6 illustrates a<br>
	mathematical addition of opposing angular responses 652 and 654 of first order<br>
	directional physical microphone elements to generate an angular response 656 of a<br>
	virtual omnidirectional element. FIG. 7 illustrates a mathematical subtraction of<br>
	opposing angular responses 752 and 754 of first order directional physical<br>
	microphone elements to generate an angular response 756 of a virtual first order bi-<br>
	directional element. For non-cardioid elements, weighted addition and subtraction has<br>
	to be used for generating the virtual first order bi-directional and virtual first order<br>
	omnidirectional elements.<br>
		[0033] A virtual linear first order element is generated by linearly mixing a<br>
	real or virtual first order bi-directional element with a real or virtual omnidirectional<br>
	element. A virtual non-linear even order element is generated by raising a real or<br>
	virtual first order bi-directional element to an even power (n).<br>
		[0034] Referring to FIG. 8, in one embodiment, an angular response 862 of a<br>
	linear first order element is mathematically added to an angular response 864 of a<br>
	virtual non-linear even order element (the value of n is 2) to generate a hybrid<br>
	resultant array signal comprising the directional audio signal represented by an<br>
	angular response 866. The directional audio signal may have a primary beam with a<br>
	very low distortion.<br>
		[0035] A hybrid resultant array (X) for dipole order n with 2 minor lobes is<br>
	expressed in Equation (2):<br>
6<br><br><br>
WO 2006/071405	PCT/US2005/042165<br>
		[0036] In Equation (2) M1 represents a first audio signal obtained from a first<br>
	physical directional microphone element and M2 represents a second audio signal<br>
	obtained form a second physical directional microphone element. FIG. 9 illustrates a<br>
	sample angular response 966 for the hybrid resultant array (X) for dipole order n with<br>
	2 minor lobes.<br>
		[0037] A hybrid resultant array (X) for dipole order n with 3 minor lobes is<br>
	expressed in Equation (3):<br><br>
		[0038] In Equation (3) M1 represents a first audio signal obtained form a first<br>
	physical directional microphone element and M2 represents a second audio signal<br>
	obtained form a second physical directional microphone element. FIG. 10 illustrates a<br>
	sample angular response 1066 for the hybrid resultant array (X) for dipole order n<br>
	with 3 minor lobes.<br>
		[0039] Equations 2 and 3 assume the first order directional elements are of the<br>
	cardioid form. If a non-cardioid physical element is used, the equations would have to<br>
	be modified accordingly. In this case, M1 would be the sum of a real or virtual<br>
	omnidirectional element with a real or virtual bidirectional element, the sum of which<br>
	is then divided by two. M2 would be the difference of a real or virtual omnidirectional<br>
	element and a real or virtual bidirectional element, the sum of which is then divided<br>
	by two.<br>
		[0040] As illustrated in FIG. 11, in one embodiment, the microphone array<br>
	1100 comprises two physical microphone elements: a first physical microphone<br>
	element 1110 that is a first order directional element having an angular response 1112<br>
	for a first audio signal obtained from the first physical microphone element 1110; and<br>
	a second physical microphone element 1120 that is a first order directional element<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2006/071405	PCT/US2005/042165<br>
	having an angular response 1122 for a second audio signal obtained from the second<br>
	physical microphone element 1120. The first physical microphone element 1110 and<br>
	the second physical microphone element 1120 are at an angular separation of 180<br>
	degrees to each other parallel to a beam axis 1192. In this embodiment, the first<br>
	physical microphone element 1110 and the second physical microphone element 1120<br>
	are actually on the beam axis 1192. A primary audio beam is oriented along the beam<br>
	axis 1192.<br>
		[0041] As illustrated in FIG. 12, in one embodiment, the microphone array<br>
	1200 comprises: a first physical microphone element 1210 that is an omnidirectional<br>
	element having an angular response 1212 for a first audio signal obtained from the<br>
	first physical microphone element 1210; and a second physical microphone element<br>
5	 1220 that is a first order directional element having an angular response 1222 for a<br>
	second audio signal obtained from the second physical microphone element 1220. The<br>
	second physical microphone element 1220 is oriented parallel to the beam axis 1292.<br>
	In this embodiment, the first physical microphone element 1210 and the second<br>
	physical microphone element 1220 are actually on the axis 1292. A primary audio<br>
10	 beam is oriented along a beam axis 1292.<br>
		[0042] As illustrated in FIG. 13, in one embodiment, the microphone array<br>
	1300 comprises four physical microphone elements: a first physical microphone<br>
	element 1310 that is a first order directional element having an angular response 1312<br>
	for a first audio signal obtained from the first physical microphone element 1310; a<br>
15	 second physical microphone element 1320 that is a first order directional element<br>
	having an angular response 1322 for a second audio signal obtained from the second<br>
	physical microphone element 1320; a third physical microphone element 1370 that is<br>
	a first order directional element having an angular response 1372 for a third audio<br>
	signal obtained from the third physical microphone element 1370; and a fourth<br>
20	 physical microphone element 1380 that is a first order directional element having an<br>
	angular response 1382 for a fourth audio signal obtained from the fourth physical<br>
	microphone element 1380.<br>
		[0043] The first physical microphone element 1310 and the second physical<br>
	microphone element 1320 are at an angular separation of 180 degrees to each other<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2006/071405	PCT/US2005/042165<br>
	and oriented along (or parallel to) a first axis 1392. The third physical microphone<br>
	element 1370 and the fourth physical microphone element 1380 are at an angular<br>
	separation of 180 degrees to each other and oriented along (or parallel to) a second<br>
	axis 1394. The axes 1392 and 1394 may be orthogonal to each other, and in such a<br>
	case, the microphone elements oriented along the first axis 1392 (i.e., the first<br>
	physical microphone element and the second physical microphone element) are at an<br>
	angular separation of 90 degrees from the physical microphone elements oriented<br>
	along the second axis 1394 (i.e., the third physical microphone element and the fourth<br>
	physical microphone element). In this embodiment, a primary audio beam is oriented<br>
	along a vector originating at an intersection 1396 of the first axis 1392 and the second<br>
	axis 1394, the vector having a tip that can be steered through 360 degrees in a plane<br>
	formed by the first axis 1392 and the second axis 1394.<br>
		[0044] As illustrated in FIG. 14, in one embodiment, the microphone array<br>
	1400 comprises three physical microphone elements: a first physical microphone<br>
	element 1420 that is a first order directional element having an angular response 1422<br>
	for a first audio signal obtained from the first physical microphone element 1420; a<br>
	second physical microphone element 1480 that is an omnidirectional element having<br>
	an angular response 1482 for a second audio signal obtained from the second physical<br>
	microphone element 1480; and a third physical microphone element 1430 that is a<br>
	first order directional element having an angular response 1432 for a third audio<br>
	signal obtained from the third physical microphone element 1430.<br>

	axis 1492. The third physical microphone element 1430 is oriented along a second<br>
	axis 1494. The axes 1492 and 1494 may be orthogonal to each other, and in such a<br>

	microphone element) is at an angular separation of 90 degrees from the physical<br>
	microphone element oriented along the second axis 1494 (i.e., the third physical<br>
	microphone element). In this embodiment, a primary audio beam is oriented along a<br>
	vector originating at an intersection 1496 of the first axis 1492 and the second axis<br>
	1494, the vector having a tip that can be steered completely through 360 degrees in a<br>
	plane formed by the first axis 1492 and the second axis 1494.<br>
