HIGH CONCENTRATION TOPICAL INSECTICIDE CONTAINING INSECT GROWTH REGULATOR<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATTONS<br>
[001 ]	The present application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No,<br>
60/795,674, filed April 28,2006, Priority is claimed to the application listed above, which is incorporated herein by reference,<br>
BACKGROuND OF INVENTION<br>
[002]	The invention relates generally to insecticides and more particularly to a topical<br>
insecticide, such as one suitable to use on house pets such as cats and dogs.<br>
[003]	The infestation of animals with fleas is highly undesirable. Accordingly, it has<br>
become common to administer both topical and internal insecticides to livestock and pets. Topical applications can be desirable, in that many insecticides are acceptably safe when used topically, but not when used internally.<br>
[004]	Various topical insecticides have drawbacks. Some require a large volume to be -<br>
applied to the animal. This can cause considerable mess and can lead to an unpleasant smell. Also, when the animal is a house pet there is a further complication in that the insecticide should be safe for human contact It should  carpeting and the like-Finally, even if safe, topical insecticides for house pets should not be irritating or lead to rashes, hair loss or exhibit other unpleasant side effects.<br>
[005]	Accordingly, it is desirable to provide an improved topical insecticide, which<br>
overcomes drawbacks of the prior art.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE TNVENTTON<br>
[006]	Generally speaking, in accordance with the invention, a topical insecticide is<br>
provided which includes an insecticide in combination with an insect growth regulator. These<br>
 <br>
ingredients are advantageously dissolved to a high concentration in a solution containing a quaternary ammonium salt, such as cetyltrimethylammonium chloride,<br>
tallowalkyltrimethylaramonium chloride, or oleyldimethylammonium chloride. The insecticide formulation of the invention can be safe to use and avoids many common deleterious side effects of conventional topical insecticides. Accordingly, provided is an improved topical insecticide that overcomes drawbacks of the prior art, a method of preparing an insecticide and a method of controlling infestation with an insecticide.<br>
[007]	The invention provides a topical insecticide that contains an insecticide and an<br>
insect growth regulator, which is advantageously effective to kill fleas, flea eggs, and flea larvae.<br>
The insecticide component preferably contains an insecticidal (tetrahydro-3-furanyl)<br>
methylamine derivative or a chloronicotinyl insecticide. It advantageously also includes an<br>
insect growth regulator (IGR) in a solvent component. Advantageous solvent solutions include<br>
those that contain water, ethyl lactate and/'or a quaternary ammonium salt. The quaternary<br>
ammonium salt is preferably a hydrophobic ammonium salt such as oleyldimethylammonium<br>
chloride, tallowalkyltrimethylammonium chloride, and oleyldimethylammonium chloride.<br>
[008]	It has been determined that an ammonium chloride with large numbers of carbon<br>
atoms, preferably about 16 or more, results in a more favorable solvent system. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the solvent component advantageously contains a sufFicient amount of the salt to increase the solvency of the IGR compared to the solvency of the IGR in the solvent without the salt. The selection of components in the solvent system allows for increased solubility of the insecticide and insect growth regulator thereby providing an insecticide having high insecticidal activity.<br>
 <br>
[009]	Active ingredients and insecticides in accordance with preferred embodiments of<br>
the invention are generally available as crystals and other solids. It has been determined that it is<br>
advantageous to dissolve or otherwise put these actives into a liquid form (e.g., mixture,<br>
emulsion, slurry, etc.) for use as topical spot products on animals. Topical spot products are<br>
more advantageous if the amount of liquid applied can be minimized. This should be balanced<br>
with the need for appropriate dosage to achieve the desired insecticidal effect. Therefore, it is<br>
desirable to use a solvent that will allow the solubilization of a high concentration of insecticide.<br>
[0010]	In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the insecticide contains 1-<br>
{(tetrahydro-3-furanyl)methyl}-2-nitro-3-methylguanidine (dinotefuran) and the IGR comprises<br>
pyriproxyfen and/or methoprene. In another preferred embodiment of the invention, the<br>
insecticide comprises a chloronicotinyl insecticide, preferably acetamiprid, imidacloprid,<br>
nitenpyram or clothianidin, and the IGR comprises pyriproxfen and/or methoprene.<br>
[0011 ]	Dinotefuran is an insecticide that kills adult fleas, and pyriproxyfen and<br>
methoprene are insect growth regulators that kill flea larvae and prevent flea eggs from hatching. Accordingly, the combmation of an insecticide, such as acetamiprid or dinotefuran and an IGR, such as pyriproxyfen or methoprene, provides fpr an effective flea control system since only about 5% of the existing fleas on an animal are adults and the other 95% are in a juvenile state (eggs and larvae).<br>
[0012]	Dinotefuran and pyriproxyfen are hydrophilic and lipophilic, respectively. A<br>
solvent system that provides for solubilization of a high concentration of dinotefiiran will typically not allow pyriproxyfen to solubilize. However, it has been determined that the addition of a quaternary ammonium salt such as cetyltrimethylammonium chloride, tallowalkyltrimethyl ammonium chloride, and oleyldimethylammonium chloride allows for an effective amount of<br>
 <br>
pyriproxyfen to solubilize. Moreover, the salt can help prevent emulsification of the<br>
formulation. This advantageously produces an insecticide with high insecticidal activity.<br>
[0013]	Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide an improved topical<br>
insecticide.<br>
[0014]	Another object of the invention is to provide a method for controlling insect<br>
infestation.<br>
[GO 15]	Another object of the invention is to provide a topical insecticide that works more<br>
rapidly and/or more permanently than other insecticides and/or can include a lower total volume<br>
of insecticide applied.<br>
[0016]	Another object of the invention is to provide an improved method of making an<br>
insecticide.<br>
[0017]	Other objects and features will be in part apparent and in part pointed out.<br>

[0049]	In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the (tetraliydro-3-<br>
furanyl)methylamine derivative dissolved in the solvent component is dinotefuran. Dinotefttran<br>
is an insecticide that will kill adult fleas. Preferably, dinoteftjran is dissolved in the formulation<br>
to a concentration range of about 5 to 20%, more preferably about 10 to 15%, and most<br>
preferably about 12 to 15%. All percentages, unless otherwise evident, are on a weight basis.<br>
[0050]	In another preferred embodiment of the invention, the insecticide is formulated by<br>
dissolving an insecticidally effective amount of a chloronicotinyl insecticide and an insect<br>
growth regulator (IGR) in a solvent component. The solvent component contains a sufficient<br>
amount of quaternary ammonium salt to increase the solvency of the IGR compared to the<br>
solvency of the IGR in the solvent without the quaternary ammonium salt and to increase the<br>
effectiveness of the insecticide compared to its effectiveness without the quaternary ammonium<br>
salt. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the solvent component comprises ethanol and a<br>
quatemarj- ammonium salt. In another preferred embodiment of the invention, the solvent<br>
component comprises water, ethyl lactate and a quaternary ammoniimi salt.<br>
[0051]	In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the chloronicotinyl insecticide in the<br>
formulation is N-((6-chloro-3-pyridinyl)methyI)-N'-cyano-N-methyl-ethanim idamide (acetamiprid) and the insect growth regulator is pyriproxfen or methoprene. Acetamiprid is an insecticide that primarily kills adult fleas. Acetamiprid is disclosed in international applications PCT/JP90/01282 and PCT/EP93/01286, the contents of which are disclosed herein by reference.<br>
 <br>
[0052]	In another preferred embodiment of the invention, the insect grovth regulator is   <br>
pyriproxyfen. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, pyriproxyfen is dissolved in the formulation to a concentration range of about 0.1 to 3%, more preferably about 0.5 to 3% and most preferably about 0.9 to 1.1%. In another preferred embodiment of the invention, the formulation comprises a dosage of at least about 10 rag of pyriproxyfen to an animal. Therefore, if the formulation contains 1% pyriproxyfen, an acceptable dosage would be about 10 mg or more in a 1 mi application.<br>
[0053]	In yet another preferred embodiment of the invention, the insect growth regulator<br>
is methoprene. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, methoprene is dissolved in the<br>
formulation to a concentration range of about 0.1 to 5%, more preferably about 0.5 to 5%, and<br>
most preferably about 3.0 to 5.0%. In another preferred embodiment of the invention, the dosage<br>
comprises at least about 30 mg of methoprene administered to the animal.<br>
[0054]	In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the insecticide is formulated by<br>
dissolving dinotefuran and pyriproxyfen in a solvent comprising water, ethyl lactate and a quaternary ammonium salt, preferably oleyldimethylammonium chloride. In ancther preferred embodiment of the invention, the insecticide is formulated by dissolving dtnotefiiran and pyriproxyfen in a solvent comprising ethanol and a quatemar% ammonium salt, preferably oleyldimethylammonium chloride. Dinotefuran is an insecticide which kills adult fleas, acetamiprid is an insecticide that primarily kills adult fleas, and pyriproxyfen is an insecticide which kills flea larvae and flea eggs. By killing fleas in the adult and juvenile stages, the insecticide formulation of the invention is useful to improve the speed of result and decrease the reoccurrence of flea infestation compared to other insecticide formulations.<br>
 <br>
[0055]	In another preferred embodiment of the invention, the insecticide is formulated by<br>
dissolving acetaraiprid and pyriproxyfen in a solvent preferably comprising water, ethyl lactate and a quaternary ammonium salt, preferably oleyldimethylammonium chloride. In yet another preferred embodiment of the invention, the insecticide is fonnulated by dissolving acetamiprid and pyriproxyfen in a solvent preferably comprising ethanol and a quaternary ammonium salt, preferably oleyldimethylammonium chloride. Acetamiprid is an insecticide that primarily kills adult fleas, and pyriproxyfen is an insecticide which kills flea larvae and flea eggs. By killing fleas in the adult and juvenile stages, the insecticide formulation of the invention is useful to improve the speed of result and decrease the reoccurrence of flea infestation compared to other insecticide formulations.<br>
[0056]	High concentrations of dinotefuran and acetamiprid can be solubilized in a<br>
combination of water and ethyl lactate or ethanol. However, because dinotefiirari is hydrophilic<br>
and pyriproxyfen is lipophilic, a solvent system which provides for solubilizatior; of a high<br>
concentration of dinotefuran will not allow pyriproxyfen to solubilize properly, it has been<br>
determined that the addition of a quaternary ammonium salt such as an ammonium chloride,<br>
preferably with one or more carbon atoms, fcs" example, cetyhrimethylammoniun chloride,<br>
tallowalkyltrimethyl ammonium chloride and oleyldimethylammomum chloride, to the solvent<br>
component allows for an effective amount of pyriproxyfen to solubilize into the formulation<br>
without emulsification, thereby allowing for the delivery of high concentrations of hydrophilic<br>
and lipophilic insecticides in a single highly effective insecticidal topical solution.<br>
[0057]	Because pyriproxyfen is hydrophobic, it may be preferable to select a quaternary<br>

 <br>
[0079]	In the preparation of a formulation in accordance with the invention for use on<br>
companion animals, there are several parameters that should be considered. These are:<br>
(a)	Concentration high enough to minimize the volume of the topical applied to the animal (one would not want to put 20 ml, e.g., onto a small cat).<br>
(b)	The formulation should be stable for one month at 130°F, 110°F, 40° F, room temperature and 0° F. This helps ensure that the formulation remains stable imder the conditions that it could meet in commerce.<br>
(c)	Safe to use on the animal - particularly non-irritating since the product is applied to the skin. Also safe if ingested by the animal; ingestion can occur when cats groom themselves.<br>
(d)	Safe to use by the consumer.<br>
(e)	Efficacious in use - should kill greater than 80% or even 90% of the fleas up to 28 days.<br>
(f)	EfScacy would be reduced if crystallization occured  in the package.<br>
(g)	Needs to be aesthetically pleasing - "no oily drop" on the animal when applied.<br>
(h) Fast drying to reduce the chance of the animal shaking off the liquid thereby reducing efficacy.<br>
(i) Microbiologically stable.<br>
 <br>
[0080]	Other additives to the insecticidal formulation can include, but are not limited to,<br>
fragrances to improve odor and surfactants such as isopropyl myristate and sorbitan derivatives such as polysorbate 20 and spreading agents to increase performance. Polymers may also be used to provide enrobing of the insecticide to improve safety and adhesion to skin and hair. Examples of polymers that may be used include cationic cellulose, cationic guar, cationic acrylate polymers, agar, gelatin and alginate.<br>
[0081 ]	In practice, an effective anaount of the insecticidal formulation as described herein<br>
may be applied to a companion animal, preferably a dog or cat, as a foaming shampoo, dip, aerosol spray, pump spray, lotion, emulsifiable concentrate, aqueous or liquid flowable, suspension concentrate and by any other methods suitable for administering topical compositions to animals.<br>
[0082]	In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the insecticidal formulation can be<br>
applied as a topical drop about once a month, preferably in the area between the lihoulder blades<br>
and the base of the skull to kill fleas, flea larvae and flea eggs over a one-month period.<br>
[0083]	The following examples are given for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>
intended to be construed in a limiting maimer. [0084]<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1: Preparation of l-(("tetrahvdro-3-furanynmethvl}-2-nitro-3-methylguanidine<br>
(dinotefuran")<br>
[0085]	A mixture comprising 10.0 g of (tetrahydro-3-fiiranyl)methanol, 29. 5 g of<br>
trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride, 10.0 g of pyridine and 200 ml of dichloromethane was stirred for an hour at room temperature. Water was poured into the reaction solution to separate the organic layer, which was washed with 1 N hydrochloric acid, water and a saturated saline<br>
 <br>
solution, dried, and concentrated to obtain 20 g of 3-tetraliydro-furanylmethyl triflate. 3.25 g of<br>
60% sodium hydride were added to 12.5 g of l,5-dimethyl-2-mtroiminohexahydro-l,3,5-triazine<br>
and 60 ml of DMF at room temperature, followed by stirring for an hour. 20.0 g of the 3-<br>
tetrahydrofuranylmethyl triflate were added thereto, and the mixture was stirred at 50° C for 2<br>
hours. After cooling the mixture to room temperature, 50 ml of 2N hydrochloric acid were added<br>
thereto, followed by stirring at 50°C for 2 hours. The resultant mixture was neutralized with<br>
sodium bicarbonate and extracted with dichlororaethane, and the extract was dried and<br>
concentrated. The residue thus obtained was purified by silica gel column chromatography<br>
(eluent: ethyl acetate/hexane=l/l) to obtain 7.8 g of l-{(tetrahydro-3- furanyl)methyl}- 2-nitro-<br>
3-methylguanidine (dinotefuran).<br>
Example 2: Preparation of Insecticide Formulation Containing Dinotefuran. Pyriproxyfen, and<br>
Olevldimethvlammonium Chloride<br>
[0086]	0.5 g of oleyldimethylammonium chloride was added to 0.5 g of pyriproxyfen<br>
with heat (50 degrees C) and dissolved. 20.75 g of water followed by 20.75 g of ethyl lactate was<br>
then added. 2.1 g of t-octylphenoxzypolyethoxyethanol containing 9 moles of ethlyene oxide<br>
(OP 9) was added. 7.8 g of dinotefuran was dissolved in the solution by stirring to produce a<br>
clear homogeneous solution followed by COOLING THE PH Was adjusted<br>
with sodium carbonate solution to between 5.5 and 7.<br>
Example 3: Stability of Dinotefuran/Pyriproxvfen Formulations<br>
[0087]	Few solvent systems allow for dinotefuran to remain in solution for one month at<br>
low temperatures. Further, solvent systems which allow for high concentrations of dinotefuran<br>
to be dissolved do not typically allow for the solubilization of pyriproxyfen. As shown in Table<br>
1, it has been determined that including a quaternary ammonium salt in the solvent allows for an<br>
effective amount of pyriproxyfen to become and remain solubilized, thereby producing a stable<br>
 <br>
formulation. The stability of the formulation is based on the criterion of no crystal formation at 0° F during a 1 month period.<br>
 <br>
dinotefuran can be increased by adding a quaternary amine such as an ammonium chloride salt, for example, cetyltrimethylammonium chloride, tallowalkyltrimethyl ammonium chloride and oleyldimethylammonium chloride compared to a similar formulation without the quaternary ammonium salt The inclusion of a quaternary about 20% results in a formulation which is stable.<br>
Example 4<br>
[0089]	Formulations containing varying ratios of solvent components were prepared<br>
using the procedure discussed in Example 2.<br>
[0090]	Table 2 contains the composition of the various formulations and demonstrates<br>
that the inclusion of a quaternary ammonium salt produces a stable solution containing<br>
 <br>
dinotefixran and pyriproxfen. Stability of the fonnulation is based on the criterion of no crystal formation at 0° F during a 1 month period.<br>
