COMPLETE SPECIFICATION [See Section 10, rule 13]<br>
"ENGINE SUPPORTING STRUCTURE FOR MOTORCYCLE"<br>
HONDA MOTOR CO., LTD., a corporation of Japan having a place of business at 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan,<br>
The   following   specification   particularly   describes   the   nature   of  the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br><br><br>
[Detailed Description of the Invention] [0001]<br>
[Field of the Invention]<br>
The present invention relates to engine supporting structure for a motorcycle. [0002]<br>
[Prior Art]<br>
There has been known engine supporting structure for a motorcycle provided wi th rubber bushing on a bearing of an engine supporting portion (See, for example, Patent Literature 1). [0003]<br>
[Patent Literature 1]<br>
Japanese Utility Model Publication No. 4-26319 (page 5, Fig. 2) [0004]<br>
The engine supporting structure for a motorcycle shown in Fig. 9 of the Patent Literature 1 is structure in.which right rubber bushing 06 integrally baked through inner and outer cylinders O11, 012 (for the symbols, symbols of the Publication<br>
2<br><br>
are applied) is mounted to a right through-hole of a power unit 03, and this power unit 03 is mounted to a second link 02 with bolts in such a manner as to be freely swingable, and even on the right side of the drawing omitted, there are also provided the similar left through-hole of power unit 03 and left rubber busing 06 to the left side of the drawing.<br>
Therefore, in the above-described engine supporting structure for a motorcycle, since the left and right through-holes are independent to each other during maintenance, it is possible to easily replace the left and right rubber bushing 06. [0005]<br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
In the case of a power unit case made of casting, however, the above-described left and right through-holes may be integrally formed, and because of the characteristic of the casting, the integrally-formed through-hole is formed to taper off inwardly. Therefore, in the structure in which rubber bushing are mounted to the integrally-formed left and right through-holes, when rubber bushing, which are expendable supplies, are replaced during maintenance, it is necessary to draw the left rubber bushing on the left side out, and to draw the right rubber bushing on the right side out, and it is extremely difficult to draw out.<br>
Also, since it takes great cost to replace the power unit,<br>
it is not desirable.<br>
In other words, in the engine supporting structure for a motorcycle of a type of mounting rubber bushing to the left<br><br>
and right integrally-formed through-holes, it is preferable to simply remove the rubber bushing during maintenance. [0006]<br>
Thus, it is an object of the present invention to provide engine supporting structure for a motorcycle capable of simply removing the rubber bushing during maintenance. [0007]<br>
[Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
In order to achieve the above-described object, there is provided a motorcycle provided with rubber bushing on a bearing of an engine supporting portion of a swing type power unit in which an engine and a rear wheel swing integrally, according to Claim 1, characterized in that the engine supporting portion is made into wide width structure for extending in the widthwise direction of the vehicle body, the rubber bushing is pressed in from both left and right sides thereof, and on the inside of the rubber busing, there is provided a drawing-out member such as a   drawing-out nut or washer.<br>
[0008]<br>
When the swing type power uni t has been removed, the rubber busing provided on the bearing of the engine supporting portion are expendable supplies, and therefore, it is necessary to replace. Since, however, the rubber bushing are in a state in which they have been brought into tight contact with the bearing, it is next to impossible to remove them simply. If it is made possible to simply remove them, the workability during maintenance will be able to be improved, and it is preferable. [0009]<br><br>
Thus, the engine supporting portion is made into wide width structure for extending in the widthwise direction of the vehicle body, the rubber bushing are pressed in from both left and right sides thereof, and on the inside of the rubber busing, there is provided a drawing-out member such as a drawing-out nut or washer.<br>
In other words, on the inside of the rubber busing, there is provided a drawing-out member such as a drawing-out nut or washer, whereby the rubber bushing canbe removed from thebearing by pulling or pressing this drawing-out member. As a result, the workability during maintenance can be improved. [00103<br>
Claim 2 is characterized in that the engine is a wheel side type engine.<br>
When the engine is a wheel side type engine, the engine supporting portion is often made into wide width structure for extending in the widthwise direction of the vehicle body. Therefore, on the inside of the rubber busing, it is effective to provide a drawing-out member such as a drawing-out nut or washer, and it is possible to enhance the replacement property of the rubber bushing.<br>
[0011]<br>
Claim 3 is characterized in that the engine supporting portion has been integrally formed with a bearing by casting, the bearing is formed with left and right straight portions straightening draft angles for enlarging in their diameter toward both left and right sides, and rubber bushing are pressed into these left and right straight portions respectively.<br><br>
[0012]<br>
When the engine supporting portion is integrally formed with the bearing by casting, the bearing requires draft angles for enlarging in their diameters toward both left and right sides. Therefore, the bearing is formed with left and right straight portions for straightening draft angles, and rubber bushing are pressed into these left and right straight portions respectively.<br>
The bearing is formed with left and right straight portions for straightening the draft angles, and rubber bushing are pressed into these left and right straight portions respectively, whereby it is possible to improve adherence of the rubber bushing to the bearing. [0013]<br>
Claim 4 is characterized in that the rubber bushing is constituted by: an outer pipe to be pressed into the straight portion; an inner pipe which a supporting shaft for supporting the engine supporting portion on the vehicle body side is caused to penetrate; and a rubber bushing body portion interposed between these outer pipe and inner pipe, and that this rubber busing body portion is fixed between the outer pipe and the inner pipe. [0014]<br>
The rubber bushing is constituted by: an outer pipe to be pressed into the straight portion; an inner pipe which the supporting shaft for supporting the engine supporting portion on the vehicle body side is caused to penetrate; and the rubber bushing body portion interposed between these outer pipe and<br><br>
inner pipe, whereby these three parts can be assembled on the left and right straight portions at the same time. As a result, it is possible to improve the assembly property of the engine supporting portion.<br>
Also, the rubber busing body portion is formed by fixing it between the outer pipe and the inner pipe, whereby these outer pipe, inner pipe and the rubber bushing body portion can be integrally formed to reduce the cost of the rubber bushing. [0015]<br>

Fig. 4 is a perspective view showing frame structure in which the engine supporting structure for the motorcycle according to the present invention has been adopted.<br>
The frame structure 210 for the scooter type vehicle is composed of: a main pipe 71 for extending downward toward the<br><br>
rear from a head pipe 211 and extending substantially horizontally from the intermediate part; left and right rear frames 73, 73 for rising upward toward the rear from the rear part of this main pipe 71; a first cross pipe 76 coupled to the rear end of the main pipe 71; engine hanger brackets 77, 77 welded to left and right end surfaces of this first cross pipe 76; a second cross pipe 74 for connecting the front parts of left and right rear frames 73, 73 together; longitudinal coupling members 213, 213 for laying between this second cross pipe 74 and the first cross pipe 76; a front floor supporting member 215 mounted in front of the lower part of the main pipe 71 in order to support a floor panel 222 (See Fig. 14) to be described later; an intermediate floor supporting member 216 mounted in the intermediate part of the lower part of the main pipe 71 in order to support the floor panel 222; left and right floor supporting frames 217, 217 welded to  the left and right engine hanger brackets 77, 77 and within a cross-sectional area range of the first cross pipe 76 respectively in order to support the floor panel 222; and left and right side frames 218, 218 for being laid between end portions of these front floor supporting member 215, the intermediate floor supporting member 216 and the left and right floor supporting frames 217, 217.<br>
[0024]<br>
In this respect, the floor supporting frame 217 is a pipe<br>
or a member formed in a pipe shape.<br>
Also, reference numeral 219 designates an installation area of the floor supporting frame 217 to be installed to the engine hanger bracket 77; 221, a shaft hole (bolt hole) for<br><br>

Fig. 5 is a plan view showing frame structure in which the engine supporting structure for the motorcycle according to the present invention has been adopted, adding the contour line of the scooter type vehicle 10.  In other words, Fig. 5 shows that the left and right floor panels 222 have been supported by the front floor supporting member 215  mounted in front of the lower part of the main pipe 71; the intermediate floor supporting member 216 mounted in the intermediate part of the lower part of the main pipe 71; the left and tight floor supporting frames 217, 217 welded to the left and right engine hanger brackets 77, 77; and left and right side frames 218, 218 for being laid between end portions of these front floor supporting member 215, intermediate floor supporting member 216 and left and right floor supporting frames 217, 217. [0026]<br>
Also, the frame structure 210 for the scooter type vehicle is frame structure for suspending the Swing type power unit 16 which integrally swings the engine 3 3. (See Fig. 2) and the rear wheel 17 through the suspension link 61 at the rear end of the main pipe 71 in such a manner as tc&gt; be freely swingable.<br>
[0027]<br>
Fig. 6 is a plan view showing a scooter type vehicle in<br><br><br>
which the engine supporting structure for the motorcycle according  to the present invention has been adopted, and frame structure 210 of the scooter type vehicle can be said to be a scooter type vehicle 10 {See Fig. 5) having: a main pipe 71 for extending downward toward the rear from a head pipe 211 (See Fig. 4) and extending substantially horizontally from the intermediate part; left and right rear frames 73, 73 for rising upward toward the rear from the rear part of this main pipe 71; and a swing type power unit 16 for suspending in the rear part of the main pipe 71, characterized in that the first cross pipe 76 is coupled to the rear end of the main pipe 71, the eng-ine hanger bracket 77 is welded to  the end  surface of this first cross pipe 76, and the floor supporting frame 217 is welded to this engine hanger bracket 77 and within a range of the cross-sectional area of the first cross pipe 76.<br>
In this respect, the swing type power unit 16 is a unit for integrally swinging the engine 31 and the rear wheel 17. [0028]<br>
If frame structure for a scooter type vehicle capable of increasing the rigidity of surroundings of the engine hanger bracket, for example, without increasing the vehicle body weight could be   implemented,   it  would be  preferable. [0029]<br>
Thus, to the rear end of the main pipe 71, there is coupled the first cross pipe 76; to the end surface of this first cross pipe 76, there is welded the engine hangar bracket 77; to this engine hanger bracket 77, and within the range of the cross-sectional area of the first cross pipe 76, there is welded<br><br><br>
the floor supporting frame 217.<br>
In other words, the first cross pipe 76 is coupled to<br>
the rear end of the main pipe 71 and the engine hanger bracket<br>
77 is welded to the end surface of this first cross pipe 76, whereby the end surface of the first cross pipe 76 is capable of performing a function as a reinforcement rib of the engine hanger bracket 77. As a result, the weight of the engine hanger bracket 77 can be reduced.<br>
[0030]<br>
Fig. 7 is a plan view of principal part showing frame structure in which the engine supporting structure for the motorcycle according to the preset invention has been adopted, and shows that when an outer diameter of the first cross pipe 76 is assumed to be D, and the outer diameter of the floor supporting frame 217 is assumed to be d, the frame structure 210 of the scooter type vehicle is obtained by welding the floor supporting frame 217 within a range of the outer diameter D of the first cross pipe 76.<br>
[0031]<br>
In other words, in the frame structure 210 of the scooter type vehicle, the floor supporting frame 217 is welded to the engine hanger bracket 77 and within the range of the cross-sectional area of the first cross pipe 76, whereby a force to be applied from the floor supporting frame 217 can be received within the range of the cross-sectional area of the first cross pipe. As a result, even if a force from the floor panel 222<br>
(See Fig. 5) may be exerted on the engine hanger bracket 77, an influence to be given to a portion (neighborhood of the shaft<br><br>
hole 221) to be supported by the swing type engine unit 16 (See<br>
Fig. 6) can be minimized.<br>
[0032]<br>
Fig. 8 is a side view of principal part showing frame structure in which the engine supporting structure for the motorcycle according to the present invention has been adopted, and the frame structure 210 for the scooter type vehicle shows that the front parts of the left and right rear frames 73, 73 (73 on the right side is not shown) are connected together with the second cross pipe 74, and that the longitudinal coupling members 213, 213 have been laid between this second cross pipe<br>
74 and the first cross pipe 76.<br><br>
[0033]<br>
The front parts of the left and right rear frames 73, 73 are connected together with the second cross pipe 74, and the longitudinal coupling members 213, Q13 are laid between this second cross pipe 74 and the first cross pipe 76, whereby efficient reinforcement of surroundings of the engine hanger bracket 77 can be performed. As a result, an increase in the vehicle body weight can be minimized.<br>
[0034]<br>
The floor supporting frame 217 is a pipe or a member formed in a pipe shape, and therefore, the installation area 219 of the floor supporting frame 217 to be installed to the engine hanger bracket 77 is also a pipe or a mender formed in a pipe<br>
shape.<br>
In other words, in the frame structure 210 for the scooter type vehicle, the installation area 219 of the floor supporting    <br><br>
frame 217 to be installed to the engine hanger bracket 77 can be said to be a pipe or a member formed in a pipe shape. [0035]<br>
Generally, a closed loop shape in a sectional shape is<br>
known to have high f lexural rigidity or torsional rigidity and<br>
the pipe or the member formed in a pipe shape is a member on<br>
the market for general purpose use.<br>
Thus, the installation area 219 of the floor supporting<br>
frame 217 to be installed to the engine hanger bracket 77 is made into a pipe or a member formed in a pipe shape, whereby<br>
it is possible to improve the rigidity of the floor supporting frame 217 and to reduce the cost of the floor supporting frame 217.<br>

Next, as engine supporting structure 240 for the motorcycle, the description will be made of another example of structure (engine supporting structure for the motorcycle) for supporting the swing type power unit 16 on a suspension link 61 shown in Fig . 2 in such a manner as to be freely swingable.<br>
[0037]<br>
Fig. 9 is a plan sectional view showing the engine supporting structure for the motorcycle according to another example of the present invention, and the engine supporting structure 240 for the motorcycle is integrally formed to the crankcase 64 by casting, and is constituted by: an engine supporting portion 241 extending in the widthwise direction of the vehicle body; a bearing 242 provided on this engine supporting portion 241; straight portions 243, 243 obtained<br><br>
by machining an inlet portion of this bearing 242 straight; nuts 247 as drawing-out members, provided at respective bottoms 246, 246 of these straight portions 243, 243; and rubber bushing 248, 248 pressed into the straight portions 243, 243. [0038]<br>
The rubber bushing 248 is composed of: an outer pipe 251 to be pressed into the straight portion 243; an inner pipe 252 which a supporting shaft for supporting the engine supporting portion 241 on the vehicle body (body frame) 11 side is caused to penetrate; and a rubber bushing body portion 253 interposed between these outer pipe 251 and inner pipe 252, and is obtained by fixing this rubber busing body portion 253 between the outer pipe 251 and the inner pipe 252. [0039]<br>
The rubber bushing 248 is constituted by: an outer pipe<br>
251	to be pressed into the straight portion 243; an inner pipe<br>
252	which a bolt 249 as the supporting shaft for supporting the engine supporting portion 241 on the vehicle body side is caused to penetrate; and the rubber bushing body portion 253 interposed between these outer pipe 251 and inner pipe 252, whereby these three parts can be individually assembled, for example, on the left and right straight portions 243, 243. As a result, it is possible to improve the assembly property of the engine supporting portion 241.<br>
[0040]<br>
Also, the rubber busing body portion 253 is formed by fixing it between the outer pipe 251 and the inner pipe 252, whereby these outer pipe 251, inner pipe 252 and the rubber<br><br>
bushing body portion 253 can be integrally formed to reduce<br>
the cost of the rubber bushing 248.<br>
[0041]<br>
Also, there are provided straight portions 243, 243 obtained by machining inlet portions of the bearing 24 2 straight, whereby there is no need to make bearing 242 portions of the engine supporting portion 241 have the same diameter throughout both the left and right sides and the intermediate portion. Therefore, it is easy to machine the bearing 242 portions. [0042]<br>
In other words, the engine supporting structure 240 for the motorcycle can be said to be a motorcycle in which the bearing 242 of the engine supporting portion 241 of a swing type power unit 16 in which an engine 31 (See Fig. 15) and the rear wheel 17 swing integrally is provided with rubber bushing 248, characterized in that that the engine supporting portion 241 is made into the wide width structure extending in the widthwise direction of the vehicle body, the rubber bushing 248 is pressed in from both left and right sides thereof, and on the inside of the rubber bushing 248, there is provided a drawing-out nut (drawing-out member) 247. [0043]<br>
For example, since when the swing type power unit has been removed, rubber busing provided on the bearing of the engine supporting portion are consumable supplies, it is necessary to replace. Since, however, the outer piping of the rubber bushing is in a state in which it has been brought into tight contact with the bearing, it is next to impossible to remove simply.<br><br>
If it is made possible to remove simply, it will be able to enhance the replacement property of the rubber bushing which are consumable supplies during maintenance, which is preferable. [0044]<br>
Thus, the engine supporting portion 241 is made into the wide width structure extending in the widthwise direction of the vehicle body, the rubber bushing 248, 248 are pressed in from both left and right sides thereof, and on the inside of the rubber bushing 248, 248, there are provided drawing-out members 247, 247 such as drawing-out nuts. [0045]<br>
In other words, on the inside of the rubber bushing 248, 248, there are provided drawing-out members 247, 247 such as drawing-out nuts, whereby the rubber bushing 248, 248 can be removed from the bearing 242 (straight portions 243, 243) by pulling or pushing these drawing-out members 247, 247. As a result, the workability during maintenance can be improved. [0046]<br>
The engine supporting structure 240 for the motorcycle can be also said to be the structure adopted for a vehicle 10 (See Fig. 14) which is a wheel side type engine in which the engine 31 is arranged on one side of the vehicle body (body frame) 11 as shown in Fig. 15.<br>
When the engine 31 is the wheel side type engine, the engine supporting portion 241 is often made into the wide width structure extending in the widthwise direction of the vehicle body. Therefore, it is effective to provide a drawing-out member<br><br>
247 such as a drawing-out nut or a washer on the inside of the rubber bushing 248, and the replacement property of the rubber bushing 248 can be enhanced.<br>
[0047]<br>
The engine supporting structure 240 for the motorcycle can be said to be the structure obtained by integrally forming the bearing 24 2 with the engine supporting portion 241 by casting, in which the bearing 242 is formed with left and right straight portions 243, 243 for straightening draft angles for enlarging in their diameter toward both left and right sides, and in which rubber bushing 248, 248 are pressed into these left and right straight portions 243, 243 respectively.<br>
[0048]<br>
When the bearing 242 is integrally formed with the engine supporting portion 241 by casting, the bearing 242 requires draft angles for enlarging in their diameters toward both left and right sides . Therefore, the bearing 242 is formed with left and right straight portions 243 , 243 for straightening the draft angles, and rubber bushing 248, 248 are pressed into these left and right straight portions 243, 243 respectively.<br>
[0049]<br>
In other words, the bearing 242 is formed with left and right straight portions 243, 243 for straightening the draft angles, and rubber bushing 248, 248 are pressed into these left and right straight portions 243, 243 respectively, whereby it is possible to improve adherence of the rubber bushing to the bearing 242. [0050]<br><br><br>
Fig. 10 is a perspective view showing a nut in the engine supporting structure of the motorcycle according to another example of the present invention.<br>
The nut 247 is a cylindrical nut, and is a member equipped with a fitting portion 255 for fitting in the straight portion 243 (See Fig. 18) and a female thread portion 256 for screwing in the drawing-out bolt 267 (See Fig. 21) to be described later. [0051]<br>
