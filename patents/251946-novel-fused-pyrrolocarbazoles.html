As used herein, the terms "enhance" or "enhancing" when used to modify the<br>
terms "function" or "survival" means that the presence of a compound of the present<br>
invention has a positive effect on the function and/or survival of a trophic factor<br>
responsive cell compared with a cell in the absence of the compound. For example, and<br>
not by way of limitation, with respect to the survival of, e.g., a cholinergic neuron, a<br>
compound of the present invention would evidence enhancement of survival of a<br>
cholinergic neuronal population at risk of dying (due to, e.g., injury, a disease condition, a<br>
degenerative condition or natural progression) when compared to a cholinergic neuronal<br>
population not presented with such a compound, if the treated population has a<br><br>
comparatively greater period of functionality than the non-treated population. As a further<br>
example, and again not by way of limitation, with respect to the function of, e.g., a sensory<br>
neuron, a compound of the present invention would evidence enhancement of the function<br>
(e.g. neurite extension) of a sensory neuronal population when compared to a sensory<br>
neuronal population not presented with such a compound, if the neurite extension of the<br>
treated population is comparatively greater than the neurite extension of the non-treated<br>
population.<br>
As used herein, the terms "inhibit" or "inhibition" refer to a specified response of a<br>
designated material (e.g., enzymatic activity) is comparatively decreased in the presence<br>
of a compound of the present invention.<br>
As used herein, the terms "cancer" or "cancerous" refer to any malignant<br>
proliferation of cells in a mammal. Examples include prostate, benign prostate<br>
hyperplasia, ovarian, breast, brain, lung, pancreatic, colorectal, gastric, stomach, solid<br>
tumors, head and neck, neuroblastoma, renal cell carcinoma, lymphoma, leukemia, other<br>
recognized malignancies of the hematopoietic systems, and other recognized cancers.<br>
As used herein the terms "neuron", "cell of neuronal lineage" and "neuronal cell"<br>
refer to a heterogeneous population of neuronal types having singular or multiple<br>
transmitters and/or singular or multiple functions; preferably, these are cholinergic and<br>
sensory neurons. As used herein, the phrase "cholinergic neuron" means neurons of the<br>
Central Nervous System (CNS) and Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) whose<br>
neurotransmitter is acetylcholine; exemplary are basal forebrain and spinal cord neurons.<br>
As used herein, the phrase "sensory neuron" includes neurons responsive to environmental<br>
cues (e.g., temperature, movement) from, e.g., skin, muscle and joints; exemplary is a<br>
neuron from the DRG.<br>
As used herein the term "trophic factor" refers to a molecule that directly or<br>
indirectly affects the survival or function of a trophic factor responsive cell. Exemplary<br>
trophic factors include Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor (CNTF), basic Fibroblast Growth<br>
Factor (bFGF), insulin and insulin-like growth factors (e.g., IGF-I, IGF-H, IGF-III),<br>
interferons, interleukins, cytokines, and the neurotrophins, including Nerve Growth Factor<br>
(NGF), Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), Neurotrophin-4/5 (NT-4/5) and Brain Derived<br>
Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF).<br><br>

includes a receptor to which a trophic factor can specifically bind; examples include<br>
neurons (e.g., cholinergic and sensory neurons) and non-neuronal cells (e.g., monocytes<br>
and neoplastic cells).<br>
As used herein the terms "trophic factor activity" and "trophic factor-induced<br>
activity", refer to both endogenous and exogenous trophic factors, where "endogenous"<br>
refers to a trophic factor normally present and "exogenous" refers to a trophic factor added<br>
to a system. As defined, "trophic factor induced activity" includes activity induced by (1)<br>
endogenous trophic factors; (2) exogenous trophic factors; and (3) a combination of<br>
endogenous and exogenous trophic factors.<br>
As used herein, the term "at risk of dying" in conjunction with a biological<br>
material, e.g., a cell such as a neuron, refers to a state or condition which negatively<br>
impacts the biological material such that the material has an increased likelihood of dying<br>
due to such state or condition. For example, compounds disclosed herein can "rescue" or<br>
enhance the survival of motoneurons which are naturally at risk of dying in an in ovo<br>
model of programmed cell death. Similarly, for example, a neuron may be at risk of dying<br>
due to the natural aging process which occasions the death of a neuron, or due to an injury,<br>
such as a trauma to the head, which may be such that neurons and/or glia, for example,<br>
impacted by such trauma may be at risk of dying. Further, for example, a neuron may be<br>
at risk of dying due to a disease state or condition, as in the case of neurons at risk of<br>
dying as occasioned by the disease ALS. Thus, by enhancing the survival of a cell at risk<br>
of dying by use of a compound of the claimed invention is meant that such compound<br>
decreases or prevents the risk of the death of the cell.<br>
As used herein the term "contacting" refers to directly or indirectly causing<br>
placement together of moieties, such that the moieties directly or indirectly come into<br>
physical association with each other, whereby a desired outcome is achieved. Thus, as<br>
used herein, one can "contact" a target cell with a compound as disclosed herein even<br>
though the compound and cell do not necessarily physically join together (as, for example,<br>
is the case where a ligand and a receptor physically join together), as long as the desired<br>
outcome is achieved (e.g., enhancement of the survival of the cell). Contacting thus<br>
includes acts such as placing moieties together in a container (e.g., adding a compound as<br><br>
disclosed herein to a container comprising cells for in vitro studies) as well as<br>
administration of the compound to a target entity (e.g., injecting a compound as disclosed<br>
herein into a laboratory animal for in vivo testing, or into a human for therapy or treatment<br>
purposes).<br>
As used herein, a "therapeutically effective amount" refers to an amount of a<br>
compound of the present invention effective to prevent or treat the symptoms of a<br>
particular disorder.<br>
As used herein, the term "subject" refers to a warm blooded animal such as a<br>
mammal, preferably a human, or a human child, which is afflicted with, or has the<br>
potential to be afflicted with one or more diseases and conditions described herein.<br>
As used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable" refers to those compounds,<br>
materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound<br>
medical judgment, suitable for contact with the tissues of human beings and animals<br>
without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem complications<br>
commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.<br>
As used herein, "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" refer to derivatives of the<br>
disclosed compounds wherein the parent compound is modified by making acid or base<br>
salts thereof. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited<br>
to, mineral or organic acid salts of basic residues such as amines; alkali or organic salts of<br>
acidic residues such as carboxylic acids; and the like. The pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salts include the conventional non-toxic salts or the quaternary ammonium salts of the<br>
parent compound formed, for example, from non-toxic inorganic or organic acids. For<br>
example, such conventional non-toxic salts include those derived from inorganic acids<br>
such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, sulfamic, phosphoric, nitric and the like; and<br>
the salts prepared from organic acids such as acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, stearic,<br>
lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, pamoic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, phenylacetic,<br>
glutamic, benzoic, salicylic, sulfanilic, 2-acetoxybenzoic, fumaric, toluenesulfonic,<br>
methanesulfonic, ethane disulfonic, oxalic, isethionic, and the like.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present invention can be prepared<br>
from the parent compound which contains a basic or acidic moiety by conventional<br>
chemical methods. Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting the free acid or base<br><br>
forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base or acid in<br>
water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two. Generally, nonaqueous media<br>
like ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol, or acetonitrile are preferred. Lists of<br>
suitable salts are found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17th ed., Mack<br>
Publishing Company, Easton, PA, 1985, p. 1418, the disclosure of which is hereby<br>
incorporated by reference.<br>
As used herein, the term "unit dose" refers to a single dose which is capable of<br>
being administered to a patient, and which can be readily handled and packaged,<br>
remaining as a physically and chemically stable unit dose comprising either the active<br>
compound itself, or as a pharmaceutically acceptable composition, as described<br>
hereinafter.<br>
As used herein, "prodrug" is intended to include any covalently bonded carriers<br>
which release the active parent compound as defined in the present invention in vivo when<br>
such prodrug is administered to a mammalian subject. Since prodrugs are known to<br>
enhance numerous desirable qualities of pharmaceuticals (e.g., solubility, bioavailability,<br>
manufacturing, etc.) the compounds of the present invention may be delivered in prodrug<br>
form. Thus, the present invention contemplates prodrugs of the claimed compounds,<br>
compositions containing the same, and methods of delivering the same. Prodrugs of a<br>
compound of the present invention may be prepared by modifying functional groups<br>
present in the compound in such a way that the modifications are cleaved, either in routine<br>
manipulation or in vivo, to the parent compound. Accordingly, prodrugs include, for<br>
example, compounds of the present invention wherein a hydroxy, amino, or carboxy group<br>
is bonded to any group that, when the prodrug is administered to a mammalian subject,<br>
cleaves to form a free hydroxyl, free amino, or carboxylic acid, respectively. Examples<br>
include, but are not limited to, acetate, formate and benzoate derivatives of alcohol and<br>
amine functional groups; and alkyl, carbocyclic, aryl, and alkylaryl esters such as methyl,<br>
ethyl, propyl, iso-propyl, butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, cyclopropyl, phenyl, benzyl,<br>
and phenethyl esters,.and the like.<br>
It is recognized that compounds of the present invention may exist in various<br>
stereoisomeric forms. As such, the compounds of the present invention include their<br>
respective diastereomers or enantiomers. The compounds are normally prepared as<br><br>
racemates and can conveniently be used as such, but individual diastereomers or<br>
enantiomers can be isolated or synthesized by conventional techniques if so desired. Such<br>
racemates and individual diastereomers or enantiomers and mixtures thereof form part of<br>
the present invention.<br>
It is well known in the art how to prepare and isolate such optically active forms.<br>
Specific stereoisomers can be prepared by stereospecific synthesis using enantiomerically<br>
pure or enantiomerically enriched starting materials. The specific stereoisomers of either<br>
starting materials or products can be resolved and recovered by techniques known in the<br>
art, such as resolution of racemic forms, normal, reverse-phase, and chiral<br>
chromatography, recrystallization, enzymatic resolution, or fractional recrystallization of<br>
addition salts formed by reagents used for that purpose. Useful methods of resolving and<br>
recovering specific stereoisomers described in Eliel, E. L.; Wilen, S.H. Stereochemistry of<br>
Organic Compounds; Wiley: New York, 1994, and Jacques, J, et al. Enantiomers,<br>
Racemates, and Resolutions; Wiley: New York, 1981, each incorporated by reference<br>
herein in their entireties.<br>
It is further recognized that functional groups present on the compounds of the<br>
present invention may contain protecting groups. For example, the amino acid side chain<br>
substituents of the compounds of the present invention can be substituted with protecting<br>
groups such as benzyloxycarbonyl or t-butoxycarbonyl groups. Protecting groups are<br>
known per se as chemical functional groups that can be selectively appended to and<br>
removed from functionalities, such as hydroxyl groups and carboxyl groups. These<br>
groups are present in a chemical compound to render such functionality inert to chemical<br>
reaction conditions to which the compound is exposed. Any of a variety of protecting<br>
groups may be employed with the present invention. Preferred groups for protecting<br>
lactams include silyl groups such as t-butyldimethylsilyl ("TBDMS"),<br>
dimethoxybenzhydryl ("DMB"), acyl, benzyl, and methoxybenzyl groups. Preferred<br>
groups for protecting hydroxy groups include TBS, acyl, benzyl ("Bn"),<br>
benzyloxycarbonyl ("CBZ"), t-butyloxycarbonyl ("Boc"), and methoxymethyl. Many<br>
other standard protecting groups employed by one skilled in the art can be found in<br>

invention are shown in the Schemes 1-4. The intermediates used to prepare the examples<br>
and their mass spectral data are shown in the Table B. The reagents and starting materials<br>
are commercially available, or readily synthesized by well-known techniques by one of<br>
ordinary skill in the arts. All processes disclosed in association with the present invention<br>
are contemplated to be practiced on any scale, including milligram, gram, multigram,<br>
kilogram, multikilogram or commercial industrial scale. All substituents in the synthetic<br>
schemes, unless otherwise indicated, are as previously defined.<br><br><br><br>
The general procedures to prepare the pyrrolocarbazoles of the present invention<br>
are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,705,511 ("the '511 patent") and 6,630,500, PCT Publ.<br>
No. WO 00/47583, J. Heterocyclic Chemistry, 2001, 38, 591, and J..Heterocyclic<br>
Chemistry, 2003,40, 135. In general, the lactam nitrogen or intermediate alcohol groups<br>
of the intermediates outlined in Table B may be protected with such groups as acetyl,<br>
substituted silyl, benzyl, Boc, or dimethoxybenzhydrol.<br>
Intermediate 1-23 (wherein R is hydrogen) used to prepare examples in Table 2,<br>
was prepared from the β-ketone, 2-methyl-l,4,6,7-tetrahydro-5H-indazol-5-one (Peet, N.<br>
P.; LeTourneau, M. E.; Heterocycles, 1991, 32, 41) using methods described in the '511<br>
patent and in /. Heterocyclic Chemistry, 2003, 40, 135.<br><br><br>
As shown in Scheme 1, the N1-methyl pyrazole derivatives in Table 3 were<br>
prepared from the 1-methyl α-ketone (7. Chem. Res., 1986,1401). The N2-methyl<br>
pyrazole intermediates were prepared according to procedures in J. Heterocyclic Chem.<br>
1992, 19, 1355.<br><br><br>
Scheme 2 outlines the route to prepare carbamate-type derivatives, such as<br>
Examples 1-2, and 70-72. An alternate method to preparing N, N-di-substituted<br>
carbamates utilized a nitrophenyl carbonate intermediate which may be treated with<br>
various primary or secondary amines. Similarly urea, O-carbamate, and N-carbamate<br>
derivatives may be prepared from reaction of the appropriate amine or phenol intermediate<br>
with an isocyanate or chloroformate or from the appropriate nitrophenyl carbonate,<br>
nitrophenyl carbamate, or trichloromethylcarbonyl (see J. Org. Chem. 2003, 68,3733-<br>
3735).<br><br>
Scheme 3 outlines a route to prepare heteroaryl ethers from the corresponding<br>
phenol using a base such as sodium hydride and a heteroaryl bromide or chloride.<br><br><br>
Scheme 4 shows a route for the preparation of N-carbamates (examples 50-69) or<br>
amides (examples 74-82) from the corresponding aniline intermediates 1-29. Amino<br>
intermediates 1-29 were prepared by alkylation of the appropriate cyano-esters with the<br>
appropriate alkyl iodide or bromide followed by nitration, and subsequent RaNi reduction<br>
to provide the amino-lactam. The desired compounds were readily prepared from the<br>
amine.<br>
Heteroaryl ketones may be prepared using standard Friedel-Crafts type acylation<br>
reactions.<br>

General Procedure B Examples 141-144.<br>
In a sealed reaction tube, a suspension of the diol intermediate I (1 equivalent) in either the<br>
appropriate alcohol or methylene chloride or chloroform containing the appropriate<br>
alcohol, at room temperature was added trifluoroacetic anhydride (1-2 equiv.) slowly. The<br>
tube was flushed with nitrogen and sealed tightly. The mixture was stirred at room<br>
temperature for 1-2 hours then heated to 80 °C for 2-60 h and monitored for disappearance<br>
of starting material by HPLC. Upon completion the reaction was allowed to cool to room<br>
temperature, concentrated and worked up by both triturating the residue with ether and<br>
collecting the resulting precipitate by filtration, or extraction of the product from the<br>
reaction mixture with a suitable organic solvent. The solid product was purified by<br>
triturating with ether or flash chromatography on silica gel using ethyl acetate or a mixture<br>
of ethyl acetate and hexane. The following Examples were prepared.<br>

General procedure C for Examples 145-156:<br>
To a well-stirred suspension of the CH2OH intermediates I, II, or III in 7 mL of methylene<br>
chloride were added sequentially trifluoroacetic anhydride (5 equivalents) and N-methyl<br>
morpholine (5 eq) at 5 °C and under argon atmosphere. The resulted suspension was<br>
stirred at room temperature for 3 hours and the low boiling solvents were removed under<br>
vacuum. A stirred solution of this tritrifluoroacetate intermediate in an appropriate alcohol<br>
was heated to 80 °C for 6-48 hours in an oil bath. Gradually, the heterogeneous reaction<br>
mixture became homogeneous. When no starting material was observed by HPLC the<br>
reaction mixture was worked up by removing the solvent in vacuo. The residues was<br>
purified by either triturating with water or ether or alternatively, flash chromatography or<br>
preparative plate chromatography on silica gel using ethyl acetate or an ethyl<br>
acetate/hexane mixture.<br>

Utility<br>
The compounds of the present invention are useful, inter alia, as therapeutic agents.<br>
Particularly, the compounds are useful for kinase inhibition, such as, for example, trk,<br>
VEGFR, PDGFR, PKC, MLK, DLK, Tie-2, FLT-3, and CDK1-6. Various compounds of<br>
the present invention show enhanced pharmaceutical properties over those disclosed in the<br>
art and improved pharmacokinetic properties in mammals. The compounds of the present<br>
invention show enhanced pharmaceutical properties over those disclosed in the art,<br>
including increased MLK and DLK dual inhibition activity, or increased VEGFR and Tie-<br>
2 dual inhibition activity, along with improved pharmacokinetic properties in mammals.<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method for treating or<br>
preventing diseases and disorders, such as those disclosed herein, which comprises<br>
administering to a subject in need of such treatment or prevention a therapeutically<br>
effective amount of a compound of the present invention.<br>
In an additional embodiment, the present invention provides a method for<br>
inhibiting trk kinase activity comprising providing a compound of the present invention in<br>
an amount sufficient to result in effective inhibition. Particularly, inhibition of trk implies<br><br>
utility in, for example, diseases of the prostate such as prostate cancer arid benign prostate<br>
hyperplasia, as well as for the treatment of inflammation, such as neurological<br>
inflammation and chronic arthritis inflammation. In a preferred embodiment, the trk<br>
kinase receptor is trk A.<br>
The majority of cancers have an absolute requirement for angiogenesis, the<br>
process by which new blood vessels are formed. The most potent angiogenic cytokine is<br>
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and there has been substantial research into the<br>
development of VEGF/VEGF receptor (VEGFR) antagonists. Receptor tyrosine kinase<br>
(RTK) inhibitors could have broad spectrum antitumor activity in patients with advanced<br>
pre-treated breast and colorectal carcinoma and Kaposi's sarcoma. Potentially these agents<br>
may play a role in the treatment of both early (adjuvant) and advanced cancer. The<br>
importance of angiogenesis for the progressive growth and viability of solid tumors is well<br>
established. Emerging data suggest an involvement of angiogenesis in the<br>
pathophysiology of hematologic malignancies as well. Recently, authors have reported<br>
increased angiogenesis in the bone marrow of patients with acute myeloid leukemia<br>
(AML) and normalization of bone marrow microvessel density when patients achieved a<br>
complete remission (CR) after induction chemotherapy. Tumor angiogenesis depends on<br>
the expression of specific mediators that initiate a cascade of events leading to the<br>
formation of new microvessels. Among these, VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor),<br>
FGF (fibroblast growth factor) play a pivotal role in the induction of neovascularization in<br>
solid tumors. These cytokines stimulate migration and proliferation of endothelial cells<br>
and induce angiogenesis in vivo. Recent data suggest an important role for these<br>
mediators in hematologic malignancies as well. Isolated AML blasts overexpress VEGF<br>
and VEGF receptor 2. Thus, the VEGF/VEGFR-2 pathway can promote the growth of<br>
leukemic blasts in an autocrine and paracrine manner. Therefore, neovascularization and<br>
angiogenic mediators/receptors may be promising targets for anti-angiogenic and anti-<br>
leukemic treatment strategies. Thus, in other embodiments, the present invention provides<br>
a method for treating or preventing angiogenic disorders where VEGFR kinase activity<br>
contributes to pathological conditions, the method comprising providing a compound of<br>
the present invention in an amount sufficient to result in the vascular endothelial growth<br>
factor receptor being contacted with an effective inhibitory amount of the compound.<br><br>
Inhibition of VEGFR implies utility in, for example, angiogenic disorders such as cancer<br>
of solid tumors, endometriosis, macular degeneration, retinopathy, diabetic retinopathy,<br>
psoriasis, hemangioblastoma, as well as other ocular diseases and cancers.<br>
FLT3, a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) class III, is preferentially<br>
expressed on the surface of a high proportion of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and B-<br>
lineage acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) cells in addition to hematopoietic stem cells,<br>
brain, placenta and liver. An interaction of FLT3 and its ligand has been shown to play an<br>
important role in the survival, proliferation and differentiation of not only normal<br>
hematopoetic cells but also leukemia cells. Mutations of the FLT3 gene was first reported<br>
as an internal tandem duplication (ITD) of the juxtamembrane (JM) domain-coding<br>
sequence, subsequently as a missense mutation of D835 within a kinase domain. ITD- and<br>
D835-mutations are essentially found in AML and their frequencies are approximately 20<br>
and 6% of adults with AML, respectively. Thus, mutation of the FLT3 gene is so far the<br>
most frequent genetic alteration reported to be involved in AML. Several large-scale<br>
studies in well-documented patients published to date have demonstrated that ITD-<br>
mutation is strongly associated with leukocytosis and a poor prognosis. An inhibitor<br>
compound of FLT3 tyrosine kinase have an application in treatment of leukemia. The<br>
present invention provides a method for treating disorders characterized by responsiveness<br>
to FLT3 inhibition, the method comprising providing a compound of the present invention<br>
in an amount sufficient to result in the inhibition of FLT3.<br>
Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) was one of the first polypeptide growth<br>
factors identified that signals through a cell surface tyrosine kinase receptor (PDGF-R) to<br>
stimulate various cellular functions including growth, proliferation, and differentiation.<br>
Since then, several related genes have been identified constituting a family of ligands<br>
(primarily PDGF A and B) and their cognate receptors (PDGF-R alpha and beta). To date,<br>
PDGF expression has been shown in a number of different solid tumors, from<br>
glioblastomas to prostate carcinomas. In these various tumor types, the biologic role of<br>
PDGF signaling can vary from autocrine stimulation of cancer cell growth to more subtle<br>
paracrine interactions involving adjacent stroma and even angiogenesis. Thus, in<br>
additional embodiments, the present invention provides a method for treating or<br>
preventing disorders where PDGFR activity contributes to pathological conditions, the<br><br>
method comprising providing a compound of the present invention in an amount sufficient<br>
to result in the platelet derived growth factor receptor being contacted with an effective<br>
inhibitory amount of the compound. Inhibition of PDGFR implies utility in, for example,<br>
various forms of neoplasia, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic arthritis, pulmonary fibrosis,<br>
myelofibrosis, abnormal wound healing, diseases with cardiovascular end points, such as<br>
atherosclerosis, restenosis, post-angioplasty restenosis, and the like.<br>
In further embodiments, the present invention provides a method for treating or<br>
preventing disorders where MLK activity contributes to pathological conditions, such as<br>
those listed above, wherein the method comprises providing a compound of the present<br>
invention in an amount sufficient to result in the MLK receptor being contacted with an<br>
effective inhibitory amount of the compound. Inhibition of MLK implies utility in, for<br>
example, forms of cancer where MLKs play a pathological role as well as in neurological<br>
disorders.<br>
In still other embodiments, the present invention provides a method for treating<br>
disorders characterized by the aberrant activity of trophic factor responsive cells, the<br>
method comprising providing a compound of the present invention in an amount sufficient<br>
to result in the trophic factor cell receptor being contacted with an effective activity<br>
inducing amount of the compound. In certain preferred embodiments, the activity of the<br>
trophic factor responsive cells is ChAT activity.<br>
Fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR) are members of a family of<br>
polypeptides synthesized by a variety of cell types during the processes of embryonic<br>
development and in adult tissues. FGFR have been detected in normal and malignant cells<br>
and are involved in biological events that include mitogenic and angiogenic activity with a<br>
consequent crucial role in cell differentiation and development. To activate signal<br>
transduction pathways, FGFR are coupled to fibroblast growth factors (FGF) and heparan<br>
sulfate (HS) proteoglycans to form a biologically fundamental ternary complex. Based on<br>
these considerations, inhibitors able to block the signaling cascade through a direct<br>
interaction with FGFR could have antiangiogenesis and subsequent antitumor activity.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for treating disorders characterized<br>
by the aberrant activity of FGF responsive cells, the method comprising providing a<br><br>
compound of the present invention in an amount sufficient to result in the FGFR being<br>
contacted with an effective activity inducing amount of the compound.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can also have positive effects on the<br>
function and survival of trophic factor responsive cells by promoting the survival of<br>
neurons. With respect to the survival of a cholinergic neuron, for example, the compound<br>
may preserve the survival of a cholinergic neuronal population at risk of dying (due to,<br>
e.g., injury, a disease condition, a degenerative condition or natural progression) when<br>
compared to a cholinergic neuronal population not presented with such compound, if the<br>
treated population has a comparatively greater period of functionality than the non-treated<br>
population.<br>
A variety of neurological disorders are characterized by neuronal cells which are<br>
dying, injured, functionally compromised, undergoing axonal degeneration, at risk of<br>
dying, etc. These neurodegenerative diseases and disorders include, but are not limited to,<br>
Alzheimer's disease; motor neuron disorders (e.g. amyotrophic lateral sclerosis);<br>
Parkinson's disease; cerebrovascular disorders (e.g., stroke, ischemia); Huntington's<br>
disease; AIDS dementia; epilepsy; multiple sclerosis; peripheral neuropathies including<br>
diabetic neuropathy and chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy, AID related<br>
peripheral neuropathy; disorders induced by excitatory amino acids; and disorders<br>
associated with concussive or penetrating injuries of the brain or spinal cord.<br>
In other preferred embodiments, the compounds of the present invention are useful<br>
for treating or preventing multiple myeloma and leukemias including, but not limited to,<br>
acute myelogenous leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphocytic<br>
leukemia, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia.<br>
In additional embodiments, the present compounds are also useful in the treatment<br>
of disorders associated with decreased ChAT activity or the death, injury to spinal cord<br>
motoneurons, and also have utility in, for example, diseases associated with apoptotic cell<br>
death of the central and peripheral nervous system, immune system and in inflammatory<br>
diseases. ChAT catalyzes the synthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, and it is<br>
considered an enzymatic marker for a functional cholinergic neuron. A functional neuron<br>
is also capable of survival. Neuron survival is assayed by quantification of the specific<br>
uptake and enzymatic conversion of a dye (e.g., calcein AM) by living neurons. The<br><br>
compounds described herein may also find utility in the treatment of disease states<br>
involving malignant cell proliferation, such as many cancers.<br>
Additional embodiments of the invention are directed to the use of any compound<br>
described herein, and stereoisomers or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, in the<br>
treatment and/or prevention of any of the conditions, diseases and disorders described<br>
above. Further embodiments are directed to the use of the compounds described herein,<br>
and stereoisomers or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, in the manufacture of a<br>
medicament for treating and/or preventing said conditions, disorders and diseases.<br>
The compounds of the present invention have important functional<br>
pharmacological activities which find utility in a variety of settings, including both<br>
research and therapeutic arenas. For ease of presentation, and in order not to limit the<br>
range of utilities for which these compounds can be characterized, the activities of the<br>
compounds of the present invention can be generally described as follows:<br>
A.	Inhibition of enzymatic activity<br>
B.	Effect on the function and/or survival of trophic factor responsive cells<br>
C.	Inhibition of inflammation-associated responses<br>
D.	Inhibition of cell growth associated with hyperproliferative states<br>
E.	Inhibition of developmentally programmed motoneuron death<br>
Inhibition of enzymatic activity can be determined using, for example, VEGFR<br>
inhibition (e.g., VEGFR2 inhibition), MLK inhibition (e.g., MLK1, MLK2 or MLK3<br>
inhibition), PDGFR kinase inhibition, NGF-stimulated trk phosphorylation, PKC<br>
inhibition, or trk tyrosine kinase inhibition assays. Effect on the function and/or survival of<br>
trophic factor responsive cells, e.g., cells of a neuronal lineage, can be established using<br>
any of the following assays: (1) cultured spinal cord choline acetyltransferase ("ChAT")<br>
assay; (2) cultured dorsal root ganglion ("DRG") neurite extension assay; (3) cultured<br><br>
basal forebrain neuron ("BFN") ChAT activity assay. Inhibition of inflammation-<br>
associated response can be established using an indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase ("EDO")<br>
mRNA assay. Inhibition of cell growth associated with hyperproliferative states can be<br>
determined by measuring the growth of cell lines of interest, such as an AT2 line in the<br>
case of prostate cancer. Inhibition of developmentally programmed motoneuron death can<br>
be assessed in ovo using embryonic chick somatic motoneurons, which cells undergo<br>
naturally occurring death between embryonic days 6 and 10, and analyzing inhibition of<br>
such naturally occurring cell death as mediated by the compounds disclosed herein.<br>
The inhibition of enzymatic activity by the compounds of the present invention can<br>
be determined using, for example, the following assays:<br>
VEGFR Inhibition Assay<br>
MLK Inhibition Assay<br>
PKC Activity Inhibition Assay<br>
trkA Tyrosine Kinase Activity Inhibition Assay<br>
Tie-2 Inhibition Assay<br>
CDK1-6 Inhibition Assay<br>

A description of assays that may be used in connection with the present invention<br>
are set forth below. They are not intended, nor are they to be construed, as limiting the<br>
scope of the disclosure.<br>
Inhibition of trkA Tyrosine Kinase Activity<br>
Selected compounds of the present invention were tested for their ability to inhibit<br>
the kinase activity of baculovirus-expressed human trkA cytoplasmic domain using an<br>
ELISA-based assay as previously described (Angeles et al., Anal. Biochem. 236: 49-55,<br>
1996). Briefly, the 96-well microtiter plate was coated with substrate solution<br>
(recombinant human phospholipase C- γl/glutathione S-transferase fusion protein (Rotin<br>
et al., EMBO J., 11: 559-567, 1992). Inhibition studies were performed in 100 µl assay<br>
mixtures containing 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4,40µM ATP, 10 mM MnCl2, 0.1% BSA, 2%<br>
DMSO, and various concentrations of inhibitor. The reaction was initiated by addition of<br><br>
trkA kinase and allowed to proceed for 15 minutes at 37°C. An antibody to<br>
phosphotyrosine (UBI) was then added, followed by a secondary enzyme-conjugated<br>
antibody, alkaline phosphatase-labelled goat anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad). The activity of<br>
the bound enzyme was measured via an amplified detection system (Gibco-BRL).<br>
Inhibition data were analyzed using the sigmoidal dose-response (variable slope) equation<br>
in GraphPad Prism. The concentration that resulted in 50% inhibition of kinase activity is<br>
referred to as "IC50".<br><br>
Inhibition of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor Kinase Activity<br>
Selected compounds of the present invention were examined for their inhibitory<br>
effects on the kinase activity of baculovirus-expressed VEGF receptor (human flk-1,<br>
KDR, VEGFR2) kinase domain using the procedure described for the trkA kinase ELISA<br>
assay described above. The kinase reaction mixture, consisting of 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4,<br>
40 µM ATP, 10 mM MnCl2, 0.1% BSA, 2% DMSO, and various concentrations of<br>
inhibitor, was transferred to PLC-γ/GST-coated plates. VEGFR kinase was added and the<br>
reaction was allowed to proceed for 15 min. at 37 °C. Detection of phosphorylated<br>
product was accomplished by addition of anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (UBI). A<br>
secondary enzyme-conjugated antibody was delivered to capture the antibody-<br>
phosphorylated PLC- γ/GST complex. The activity of the bound enzyme was measured via<br>
an amplified detection system (Gibco-BRL). Inhibition data were analyzed using the<br>
sigmoidal dose-response (variable slope) equation in GraphPad Prism.<br>
Inhibition of Mixed Lineage Kinase-1 Activity<br>
The kinase activity of MLK1 was assessed using the Millipore Multiscreen TCA<br>
"in-plate" format as described for protein kinase C (Pitt &amp; Lee, J. Biomol. Screening, 1:<br>
47-51,1996). Briefly, each 50-µl assay mixture contained 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.0,1 mM<br>
EGTA, 10 mM MgCl2,1 mM DTT, 25 mM β-glycerophosphate, 60 uM ATP, 0.25 µCi [γ-<br>
32P]ATP, 0.1% BSA, 500 µg/ml myelin basic protein (UBI #13-104), 2% DMSO, 1 uM of<br>
test compound, and 1 µg/ml of baculoviral GST-MLK1KD. Samples were incubated for 15<br>
min at 37°C. The reaction was stopped by adding ice cold 50% TCA and the proteins<br>
were allowed to precipitate for 30 min at 4°C. The plates were then washed with ice cold<br>
25% TCA. Supermix scintillation cocktail was added, and the plates were allowed to<br>
equilibrate for 1-2 hours prior to counting using the Wallace MicroBeta 1450 PLUS<br>
scintillation counter.<br>
Dual Leucine Zipper Bearing Kinase Assay<br>
Compounds were tested for their ability to inhibit the kinase activity of<br>
recombinant baculoviral human DLK, containing the kinase domain and leucine zipper.<br><br>
Activity was measured in 384-well FluoroNunc plates (Cat#460372) using a time-resolved<br>
fluorescence readout (PerkinElmer Application Note 1234-968). Plates were coated with<br>
30 µl of the protein substrate MKK7 (Merritt et al. 1999) at a concentration of 20 µg/ml in<br>
Tris buffered saline (TBS). Each 30 jxl assay contained 20 mM MOPS (pH 7.2), 15 mM<br>
MgCl2,0.1 mM Na3VO4,1 mM DTT, 5 mM EGTA, 25 mM β-glycerophosphate, 0.1%<br>
BSA, 100 uM ATP, and 2.5% DMSO. Reactions were started by the addition of 10 ng/ml<br>
GST-hDLKKD/LZ. For IC50 determinations, a 10-point dose response curve was generated<br>
for each compound. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes, and the reactions<br>
stopped by the addition of 100 mM EDTA. Product was detected using Europium-labeled<br>
anti-phosphothreonine (Wallac#AD0093; diluted 1:10000 in 3%BSA/T-TBS). Following<br>
overnight capture at 4°C, 50 µl enhancement solution (Wallac #1244-105) was added and<br>
the plate gently agitated for 5 min. The fluorescence of the resulting solution was then<br>
measured using the time-resolved fluorescence (TRF) mode in the MultilabelReader<br>
(Victor2 Model # 1420-018 or Envision Model # 2100). Inhibition data was analyzed<br>
using GraphPad PRISM. See also Merritt, S.E., Mata, M., Nihalani, D., Zhu, C, Hu, X.,<br>
and Holzman, L.B. (1999) The Mixed Lineage Kinase DLK utilizes MKK7 and not<br>
MKK4 as Substrate. J. Biol. Chem. 274,10195-10202.<br>
Tie-2 Tyrosine Kinase Assay<br>
Compounds were tested for their ability to inhibit the kinase activity of<br>
recombinant baculoviral human His6-Tie2 cytoplasmic domain using a modification of the<br>
ELISA described for trkA (Angeles et al, 1996). A 384-well plate format was used for<br>
single-point screening while IC50S were performed on 96-well plates. For single-point<br>
screening, each barcoded 384-well Costar High Binding plate (Cat # 3703) was coated<br>
with 50 µl/well of 10 µg/ml substrate solution (recombinant human GST- PLC-γ; Rotin et<br>
al., 1992) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS). The Tie2 activity was measured in 50-µl assay<br>
mixtures containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.2), 40 µM ATP, 10 mM MnCl2, 2.5% DMSO,<br>
0.05% BSA, and 200 ng/ml His6-Tie2CD. For IC50 determinations, the assays were run as<br>
described above but in 96-well Costar High Binding plates (Cat # 3703) and with the<br>
volumes doubled. A 10-point dose response curve was generated for each compound. The<br>
kinase reaction was allowed to proceed at 37°C for 20 minutes. The detection antibody,<br><br>
N1-Eu anti-phosphotyrosine (PT66) antibody (Wallac #AD0041), was added at 1:2000<br>
diluted in block buffer [3% BSA in TBS with 0.05% Tween-20 (TBST)]. After one-hour<br>
incubation at 37°C, 50 µl of enhancement solution (Wallac #1244-105) was added and the<br>
plate was gently agitated. The fluorescence of the resulting solution was then measured<br>
using the time-resolved fluorescence (TRF) mode in the Multilabel Reader (Victor2 Model<br>
# 1420-018 or Envision Model # 2100). Inhibition data were analyzed using ActivityBase<br>
and IC50 curves were generated using XLFit. The cited references are as follows:<br>
