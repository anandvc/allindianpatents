				<td>DESCRIPTION INDUCTION HEATING DEVICE FOR A METAL PLATE<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]	This nonprovisional application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. § 119(a)<br>
on Patent Applications Nos. 2005-41944 and 2005-256334, filed in Japan on February 18, 2005 and September 5, 2005 respectively. The entirety of each of the above documents is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention:<br>
[0002]	The present invention relates to an induction heating apparatus for a<br>
metal plate such as a steel plate or an aluminum plate. The present invention particularly relates to an induction heating apparatus that heats a metal plate by generating an induced current therein using an induction coil surrounding the metal plate. The present invention also relates to an induction heating apparatus, which is capable of heating a metal plate with high efficiency irrespective of the thickness of the metal plate and irrespective of whether the metal plate is magnetic or non-magnetic. The present invention is further capable of restraining overheating at an edge area of the metal plate.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art:<br><br>
 [0003]	An indirect heating apparatus using a gas or electricity, or a direct<br>
heating apparatus using induction heating has been used for heating a metal plate to control the quality of the metal material in the heat-treatment process. Since a direct heating apparatus has no thermal inertia, unlike an indirect heating apparatus, a direct heating apparatus can save the time which is required by an indirect heating apparatus to reach a stable furnace temperature, and can easily control the heating rate, for example, when a thickness of plate is changed. Therefore, a direct heating apparatus does not require changing of the metal plate transportation speed, which prevents productivity from being lowered.<br>
[0004]	There are two types of induction heating apparatus for a metal plate. One<br>
type is an LF type (Longitudinal Flux type), in which a metal plate is heated by generating a circular induced current therein in the cross-section using an induction coil, where an alternate current with a frequency ranging normally from 1 KHz to 500 KHz is applied, surrounding the metal plate. Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram of an LF type induction heating apparatus. Figure 2 illustrates a circular induced current generated in the cross-section using an LF type induction heating apparatus. In Figure 1, an induction coil 2 connected to an AC power supply 3 surrounds a metal plate 1. When a primary current 5 is passed through the induction coil 2, a flux 4 penetrates the metal plate 1 to generate an induced current around the flux 4. In Figure 2, an induced current 6 generated in the cross-section of the metal plate 1 flows in an opposite direction to the primary current 5 running through the induction coils 2 which are located above and under the metal plate 1, respectively. The other type is a TF type (Transverse Flux type), in which induction coils with a core are located above and under the metal plate respectively. When an AC power supply to the coils is turned on, a flux penetrates the metal plate<br><br>
between the cores in the plate thickness direction to generate an induced current, which leads to heating of the metal plate.<br>
[0005]	In TF type heating, the induced current concentrates on a lateral end area<br>
of the metal plate and at the same time the current density in the vicinity of the end area is lowered, which easily causes a non-uniform temperature distribution in a lateral direction after heating. In particular, it becomes more difficult to provide a uniform heating when the positional relationship between the core of the induction coil and the metal plate is changed by shifting a width of the metal plate or by a snaking of the metal plate. In the background art, a technology that uses a rhombus-shaped coil was proposed so that the flux can always penetrate over an entire width of the plate by tilting the rhombus-shaped coil when the width of the metal plate is changed. However, this technology uses by leakage flux from the induction coil, which requires the metal plate and the induction coil to be close to each other. In addition, installation of a rotation mechanism on the induction heating apparatus where a large amount of current is supplied increases the difficulty in carrying out the technology on industrial scale.<br>
[0006]	In TF type heating, the induced current concentrates on a lateral end area<br>
of the metal plate and at the same time the current density in the vicinity of the end area is lowered, which easily causes a non-uniform temperature distribution in a lateral direction after heating. In particular, it becomes more difficult to provide a uniform heating when the positional relationship between the core of the induction coil and the metal plate is changed by shifting a width of the metal plate or by a snaking of the metal plate. In the background art, a technology that uses a rhombus-shaped coil was proposed so that the flux can always penetrate over an entire width of the plate by tilting the rhombus-shaped coil when the width of the metal plate is changed. However, this technology uses by leakage flux from the induction coil, which requires the metal plate and the induction coil<br><br>
to be close to each other. In addition, installation of a rotation mechanism on the induction heating apparatus where a large amount of current is supplied increases the difficulty in carrying out the technology on industrial scale.<br>
[0007]	The LF type heating is a method for heating a metal plate surrounded by<br>
an induction coil, which can make sure that a circular induced current is generated in the metal plate so as to heat the plate. An induced current that is generated in the cross-section of the metal plate in an LF type is concentrated at the depth "d" expressed in the following expression:<br>
[0008]	(Equation Removed)                                                               (1)<br>
[0009]	where d is the induced current penetration depth [mm], p is the specific<br>
resistance [&amp;m], ur is the relative magnetic permeability, and f is the frequency [Hz] for heating.<br>
[0010]	An induced current penetration depth increases as a temperature of the<br>
metal increases because the specific resistance increases when the temperature of the metal increases. The relative magnetic permeability of ferromagnetic material or paramagnetic material decreases as the temperature becomes closer to the Curie point, and finally becomes 1 at a temperature above the Curie point. This means that the induced current penetration depth increases as the temperature increases. Since the relative magnetic permeability of a non-magnetic material is 1, its induced current penetration depth is larger compared to that of a magnetic material.<br>
[0011]	In LF type induction heating, if the induced current penetration depth is<br>
large and yet a thickness of the metal plate is thin, the induced current generated in an upper portion of the metal and the induced current generated in a lower portion of the metal cancel each other. This leads to heating that has a low efficiency.<br><br>
 [0012]	For example, if a heating frequency of 10 KHz is used, the induced<br>
current penetration depth at room temperature is about 1 mm with aluminum of non-magnetic material, about 4.4 mm with stainless steel 304 (SUS304) and about 0.2 mm with steel of magnetic material. The current penetration depth of steel at temperature above the Curie point (at about 750°C) is about 5 mm. Most steel plates for automobiles and home electric appliances, which are major commercial products that use metal plates, have a thickness of not more than 2 mm. Therefore, it is usually difficult to heat such metal plate with high efficiency without the induced currents in the upper and lower portions of the metal plate being canceled as mentioned above. It could be thought to increase the frequency of the AC current supplied to the LF type induction heating apparatus to several hundred KHz in order to make the depth of the induced current penetration shallower, so that canceling the induced currents can be avoided; however, it is not very practical to use a large current power source with such a high frequency on an industrial scale.<br>
[0013]	It has been proposed to use an induction heating apparatus that uses an<br>
induction coil surrounding a metal plate, which is capable of heating a metal plate with high efficiency even if the metal plate is at a high temperature and/or is a thin metal plate. In such induction heating apparatus, an induction coil located above the metal plate (upper induction coil) and another induction coil located below the metal plate (lower induction coil) are arranged parallel to each other, so as to be set respectively in different positions in a longitudinal direction of the metal plate. In other words, two projected images of the upper induction coil and the lower induction coil, which are respectively formed by vertically projecting the two induction coils onto the metal plate, are parallel to each other and in a different position in the longitudinal direction of the metal plate.<br><br>
 [0014]	Figure 3 is a schematic diagram of the above-mentioned induction<br>
heating apparatus where an induction coil 2a located above the metal plate 1 (upper<br>
induction coil) and another induction coil 2b located below the metal plate 1 (lower<br>
induction coil) are arranged parallel to each other and in a different position in the<br>
longitudinal direction of the metal plate. Reference numerals 7 and 8 represent a<br>
conductive member and an AC power supply 8, respectively. Figures 4A and 4B show<br>
the flow of the induced current in the metal plate 1 when the upper induction coil and the<br>
lower induction coil are arranged in a different position in the longitudinal direction of the<br>
metal plate. Figure 4 A is a schematic diagram illustrating the state of the induced current<br>
viewed from above the metal plate. Figure 4B is a cross-sectional view taken on the line<br>
4B-4B of Figure 4A. Reference numeral 10 in Figure 4A represents the flow of the<br>
induced current. When the upper induction coil and the lower induction coil are arranged<br>
so as to be set hi a different position in the longitudinal direction of the metal plate, the<br>
upper path and the lower path of the circular induced current generated in the metal plate<br>
are also arranged to be set respectively in different positions in the longitudinal direction<br>
of the metal plate. Therefore, it makes it possible to heat the metal plate with high<br>
efficiency without cancellation of the induced currents in the upper and lower portions in<br>
the metal plate while the induced current penetration depth is large, even where the<br>
temperature of the metal plate is high and/or the metal plate is thin.<br>
[0015]	However, in the use of such an induction heating apparatus where the<br>
upper and lower induction coils are set in different positions in the longitudinal direction of the metal plate, an edge area of the metal plate in the width direction can become overheated compared to a central area of the metal plate in the width direction. This can result in a non-uniform temperature distribution as a finishing temperature in the transverse direction of the metal plate.<br><br>
[0016]	This phenomenon is experienced because a width of the induced current<br>
path in the edge area of the metal plate (corresponding to "d2" in Figure 4a), where the<br>
current flows from an upper portion to a lower portion in the metal plate, is narrower than<br>
the induced current path in the upper and lower portions of the metal plate (corresponding<br>
to "dl" in Figure 4A). Therefore, a current density in the edge area of the metal plate is<br>
higher than a current density in the central area. One reason for narrowing the current<br>
path in the edge area is that the current flowing in the edge area is to be shifted toward<br>
edge, so that the inductance between the induced current flowing in the edge area in the<br>
metal plate thickness direction and the primary current flowing through the induction coil<br>
arranged near the edge of the metal plate in the metal plate thickness direction can be<br>
lowered. Another reason for the overheating at the edge area is that the heating time at the<br>
edge area of the metal plate (defined as d3/(the traveling speed of the metal plate), where<br>
d3 is defined as in Figure 4A) is longer than the heating time at the central area (defined as<br>
dl/(the traveling speed of the metal plate), where dl is defined as in Figure 4a).<br>
[0017]	Since a heat divergence by an induction heating apparatus is proportional<br>
to a square of the current density and the heating time, an edge area of the metal plate in the transverse direction is overheated compared to a central area of the metal plate in the use of such an induction heating apparatus where an upper induction coil and lower induction coil are respectively set in different positions so as to be away from each other in longitudinal direction of the metal plate.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0018]	An object of the present invention is to solve the problems of the<br>
background art induction heating apparatus mentioned above. An embodiment of the present invention is capable of heating a metal plate with high efficiency, even where the<br><br>
temperature of metal plate is high above the Curie point, the metal plate is thin and/or the metal plate is made of a non-magnetic, non-ferrous metal with a low specific resistance such as aluminum or copper. In addition, an embodiment of the present invention is capable of providing a metal plate with a more uniform temperature in the transverse direction of the metal plate, in particular preventing overheating at an edge area of the metal plate. An embodiment of the present invention can make it easier to realize a desired temperature distribution, even when the width of metal plate to be heated is changed, without preparing a plurality of induction coils to cope with the change in the width of the metal plate. An embodiment of the present invention can also improve a non-uniform temperature distribution caused by snaking of the metal plate. Another embodiment of the present invention provides a technology that has a great flexibility in the distance between the upper and lower induction coils, the width of the induction coils and the amount of heat divergence.<br>

[0021]	In the present invention, 'a traveling metal plate is not limited to a metal<br>
plate traveling in one way, but includes reciprocating movement of the metal plate. In addition, in the present invention, an induction coil is a collective term that includes a coil formed by a tube, a wire, a plate or the like of an electric conductive material surrounding a metal plate by a single turn or more. In addition, surrounding the metal plate is not limited to a specific form such as circular or square. With regard to the materials for the electric conductor, low resistance materials such as copper, copper alloy or aluminum are preferable.<br>
[0022]	With regard to the metal plate of the present invention, a magnetic<br>
material such as steel, non-magnetic materials such as aluminum or copper and steel in a<br>
non-magnetic state at a high temperature above the Curie point are included.<br>
[0023]	In the present invention, the traverse direction of the metal plate means a<br>
direction perpendicular to a traveling direction of the metal plate.    A longitudinal<br>
direction of the metal plate means the traveling direction of the metal plate.<br>
[0024]	In the present invention, an edge of the metal plate is an end of the metal<br>

Reference numeral 1 represents a cross-sectional view of a metal plate that extends in a longitudinal direction, reference numeral 2a represents a cross-sectional view of an induction coil located above the metal plate, reference numeral 2b represents a cross-sectional view of an induction coil located below the metal plate, reference numeral 30a represents a vertically projected image of the induction coil located above the metal plate, and reference numeral 3 Ob represents a vertically projected image of the induction coil located below the metal plate.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
[0042]	The present invention will now be described with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings. All of the drawings illustrate a single turn of the Induction coil surrounding a metal plate. However, the number of turns of the induction coil in the present invention is not limited to a specific number.<br>
[0043]	Figure 6 is a plan view schematic diagram of an example of an induction<br>
heating apparatus of the present invention. In the present invention, an induction coil 2a located above the metal plate and another induction coil 2b located below the metal plate are located so as to be away from each other in the longitudinal direction of the metal plate and parallel to each other. A distance between the upper induction coil and the lower<br>
induction coil is defined as a distance between the two projected images of the upper induction coil and the lower induction coil, which are respectively formed by vertically projecting each induction coil onto the metal plate. A distance L, the above-defined distance, in the longitudinal direction between the upper and lower induction coils is kept constant in the traverse direction. Furthermore, the upper induction coil 2a and the lower induction coil 2b stretch obliquely across the metal plate at an edge area of the metal plate relative to the transverse direction. In other words, each of the upper induction coil 2a and the lower induction coil 2b is arranged obliquely at the edge area so as to have an oblique angle between each of the induction coils and the transverse direction of the metal plate. Reference numeral 7 represents a conductive member, 8 represents an AC power supply and 9 represents an induction coil located close to an edge (end) of the metal plate. Symbol 6 represents an oblique angle defined as an angle between the induction coil at the edge area and the transverse direction of the metal plate. Symbol x represents a width of the induction coil in the longitudinal direction of metal plate.<br>
[0044]	When the upper induction coil and the lower induction coil are located so<br>
as to be away from each other in the longitudinal direction of the metal plate, an upper path and a lower path of the circular induced current generated in the metal plate are also arranged to be away from each other in the longitudinal direction of the metal plate. Therefore, it makes it possible to heat the plate with high efficiency without cancellation of the induced currents in the upper and lower portions in the metal plate while the induced current penetration depth is large, even where the temperature of the metal plate is high and/or the metal plate is thin.<br>
[0045]	The distance between the upper and lower induction coils can be<br>
determined based on the material of metal plate, the temperature of the metal plate and a gap between the induction coil and the metal plate to be heated. In order to effectively<br>
heat a steel sheet in a non-magnetic region at a temperature above the Curie point, it is<br>
preferable to set the distance between the upper and lower induction coils to be 0.2 to 6<br>
times the width of the induction coil, and more preferably to set the distance to be 0.6 to 4<br>
times the width of the induction coil, considering the width of the metal plate, the width of<br>
the induction coil and a traveling speed of the metal plate.   If the distance is less than 0.2<br>
times the width of induction coil, cancellation of the induced currents in upper portion and<br>
lower portions of the metal plate occurs, which fails to heat effectively.   If the distance is<br>
more than 6 times the width of the induction coil, it becomes difficult to reduce a current<br>
density at the edge area of the metal plate and the heating time increases, which leads to a<br>
temperature increase at the edge area.    In addition, the reactance increases, which<br>
requires a high voltage power supply, which is difficult to carry out on an industrial scale.<br>
Hereinafter, when a width of the upper induction coil and a width of the lower induction<br>
coil are different, a width (in the longitudinal direction of the metal plate), unless<br>
otherwise defined, represents the width of the wider induction coil.<br>
[0046]	When the upper and the lower induction coils are respectively oblique to<br>
the transverse direction in the edge area, overheating at the edge area can be effectively<br>
restrained relative to induction coils that are not oblique.    This will be explained with<br>
reference to Figure 7.   Figure 7 is a schematic diagram illustrating the state of the<br>
induced current flow in the left edge area of the metal plate in Figure 6 viewed from above<br>
the metal plate.   An induced current 10 on the upper side and lower side of the metal<br>
plate flows in the opposite direction to a primary current passing through the induction<br>
coil where a width of the induced current is almost the same as a width of a projected<br>
image of the corresponding induction coil 30a or 30b.   The induced current passing near<br>
the edge of the metal plate tends to take the flow path closer to the central area of the<br>
metal plate, so that the inductance between the induced current and the primary current<br>
running through the induction coil located at the edge of the metal plate can be reduced. In other words, an upper induced current induced by the upper induction coil and a lower induced current induced by the lower induction coil try to connect to each other along the shortest path, although some part of the current flows at the edge. This provides a relatively wider passage of induced current flow near the edge of the metal plate to restrain the increase of current density near the edge. Thus, when the upper and lower induction coils have an oblique portion to the transverse direction at the edge area, overheating at the area can be effectively restrained relative to an induction coil that does not have such an oblique portion.<br>
[0047]	The inventors of the present invention further investigated the proper<br>
oblique angle (0 in Figure 6). A relationship between a degree of overheating in the<br>
edge area, i.e., (the temperature at the edge area)-(the temperature in the central area), and<br>
an oblique angle G was experimentally investigated using the induction heating apparatus<br>
shown hi Figure 6. The metal plate that was used was a non-magnetic SUS304 stainless<br>
steel plate (thickness: 0.2 mm, width: 600 mm). A traveling speed of the metal plate was<br>
2 m/min. The AC power supply (not shown) was 25KHz and a capacitor had a<br>
capacitance of 100KW that was adjusted to match the induction coil that was used.<br>
[0048]	The induction coil that was used was a single turn (surrounding the steel<br>
plate to be heated) of a water-cooled copper plate that was constructed of a copper plate (thickness: 5 mm, width: 100 mm) and a water-cooling copper tube (outer diameter: 10 mm, inner diameter: 8 mm) attached to the copper plate on the side (outer side ) opposite to the steel plate by brazing. In this experiment, "induction coil" included both the copper plate and the water-cooling copper tube, since the electric current also runs through the copper tube. A gap between the surface of the metal plate (SUS304 plate) and the<br>
induction coil (copper plate) was 50mm. The distance L between the upper and lower induction coils was 200mm.<br>
[0049]	The temperature of the steel plate at both the central area and edge area<br>
was measured at the exit of the induction heating apparatus using a two-dimensional infrared thermometer. In order to change the oblique angle Q between the induction coil and the transverse direction of the metal plate, the induction coils are placed on a movable wooden base and the upper and lower induction coils are connected to an induction coil 9 arranged near the edge of the metal plate by selecting appropriate bolt holes from a plurality of holes formed in the water-cooled copper plate. TABLE 1 shows the results of a relationship between a degree of overheating in the edge area, i.e., (the temperature in the edge area)-(the temperature in the central area), and an oblique angle 0.<br>
Table 1<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
[0050]	From the results, it was concluded considering a practical temperature<br>
distribution tolerance that the oblique angle ranging from 10 degrees to 60 degrees is<br>
preferable.   If the oblique angle 0 is 5 degrees or less, the prevention of overheating in<br>
the edge area of the metal plate is not sufficient, and if exceeding 60 degrees, the<br>
temperature in the edge area is also increased, since the heating time is increased even if<br>
the current density is lowered.   A preferable specific oblique angle between 10 degrees<br>
and 60 degrees should be determined hi advance based on the preexisting initial<br>
temperature difference between the temperatures at the edge area and in the central area of<br>
the metal plate to be heated.     With regard to any preexisting initial temperature<br>
distribution, there could be three representative patterns, i.e., a metal plate having a flat<br>
temperature distribution (the same temperature at the central area and the edge area), a<br>
metal plate having a temperature distribution that is slightly lower at the edge area relative<br>
to the temperature in the central area, or a metal plate having a temperature distribution<br>
that is slightly higher at the edge area relative to the temperature in the central area.<br>
[0051]	As described above, it has been found that setting the induction coil<br>
oblique to the transverse direction of the metal plate can prevent overheating at the edge<br>
area.   The inventors of the present invention further investigated what length of oblique<br>
portion the induction coil should have in the edge area to be effective in preventing<br>
overheating.   Specifically, with respect to an induction heating apparatus as shown in<br>
Figure 8 of one embodiment of the present invention, how many millimeters of the oblique<br>
portion (represented by "y" in Figure 8) should extend toward the inside (toward the<br>
central area) from the edge of the metal plate 1 in an area within 100 mm from the edge of<br>
the metal plate 1 where the temperature deviation tends to be prominent because of<br>
overheating.<br><br>
 [0052]	Figure 8 is a plan schematic view showing one example of an induction<br>
heating apparatus of the present invention. In Figure 8, an induction coil 2a located above the metal plate and another induction coil 2b located below the metal plate are located so as to be away from each other in the longitudinal direction of the metal plate. The induction coils 2a and 2b are also parallel to each other. The distance L in the longitudinal direction between the upper and lower induction coils in terms of the projected images is kept constant in the traverse direction. The upper induction coil 2a and the lower induction coil 2b in Figure 8 are parallel to the transverse direction only in the central area and have an oblique (bent) portion respectively at the edge area where each of the induction coils stretches obliquely across the metal plate relative to the transverse direction. Reference numeral 7 represents a conductive member, 8 represents an AC power supply and 9 represents an induction coil located close to an edge (end) of the metal plate.<br>
[0053]	As a result of an investigation of the induction heating apparatus of<br>
Figure 8, it was found that overheating in the edge area can be effectively restrained if the oblique portions of the induction coils extend 50 mm or more toward the inside from the edge of the metal plate. In other words, if the oblique portions of the induction coils that have an oblique angle ranging from 10 degrees to 60 degrees are located so as to cover the area within 50 mm from the edge of the metal plate, overheating at the edge area can be effectively restrained.<br>
[0054]	In the present invention, the distance in the longitudinal direction<br>
between the upper and lower induction coils is kept constant in the traverse direction. Furthermore, the upper induction coil 2a and the lower induction coil 2b each have a portion that is oblique to the transverse direction at an edge area of the metal plate. It should be noted; however, that the shape of the induction coil of the present invention is<br><br>
not limited to the shapes shown in Figures 6 and 8. The induction coils of the present<br>
invention could also be angle shaped (dogleg shaped) as shown in Figure 9 and are shaped<br>
as shown in Figure 10. In Figures 9 and 10, reference numeral 2a represents an upper<br>
induction coil located above the metal plate 1, reference numeral 2b represents a lower<br>
induction coil located below the metal plate 1, reference numeral 7 represents a conductive<br>
member, reference numeral 8 represents an AC power supply and reference numeral 9<br>
represents an induction coil located close to an edge (end) of the metal plate. The upper<br>
and lower induction coils are parallel to each other; however, the induction coils do not<br>
have to be bilaterally symmetrical with respect to the center line of the metal plate.<br>
[0055]	In a practical operation, a width of the metal plate is changed and/or the<br>
metal plate snakes. The present invention can make it possible to improve a non-uniform temperature distribution in the transverse direction of the metal plate even when the metal plate to be heated is changed in width and/or snakes while traveling. As shown in Figure 6, the oblique angle at the edge area does not change when a width of the metal plate changes from "I-F" to "II-II" and/or snakes, i.e., the position of the edge I of the metal plate fluctuates in the transverse direction.<br>
[0056]	In another embodiment of the present invention, the distance between the<br>
upper induction coil and the lower induction coil and/or a width of the induction coil is<br>
changeable.   This embodiment will be described below with reference to the drawings.<br>
[0057]	Since the heat divergence  by  an induction heating apparatus  is<br>
proportional to a square of the current density and to the heating time, adjusting the distance between the upper and lower induction coils and/or a width of the induction coil can control an amount of heat divergence. In order to obtain a necessary heat divergence in a practical operation, it is possible to determine the distance and/or the width of the induction coil in advance through electromagnetic field analysis. However, because of<br><br>
fluctuations in a previous process, a metal plate to be fed into the induction heating apparatus of the present invention may have an initial temperature variation. Therefore, the necessary heat divergence may not be obtained, even if the predetermined amount of distance and/or width of the induction coil are adopted. An induction heating apparatus of the present invention can make it possible to obtain a desired temperature independently of the preexisting temperature state given by a previous process by adjusting the distance to the temperature variation of the metal to be fed in,<br>
[0058]	Figure 11 shows an upper induction coil 2a and a lower induction coil 2b<br>
each of which is slidably mounted on a pair of guide rails 11 fixed on a pair of bases 12 that extend in the longitudinal direction of a metal plate 1. Figure 12 is a cross-sectional view of Figure 11. Well known means for moving the induction coil (not shown in Figure 11) such as an air cylinder, a hydraulic cylinder or a motor-driven cylinder can be used. Although Figure 11 shows both upper and lower induction coils'being movably mounted, it is also acceptable that either the upper coil or the lower coil is movable. Insulation materials such as ceramics and/or resins are preferable as materials for the base 12 and/or the rail 11, since they are placed in a strong magnetic field in the vicinity of the induction coil. When a metal is used in some applications, it is required that a non-magnetic metal such as stainless steel, brass or aluminum be used. In addition, the base and the rail should be located distant as far as possible from the induction coil and should be water-cooled to prevent from being heated by the induced current. In view of this, the upper and lower induction coils 2a, 2b are connected to a water-cooled connector 9 via a movable conductive member 13 such as a water-cooled cable. Reference numeral 18 represents a connecting terminal of the copper plate.<br>
[0059]	In Figure 11, an upper induction coil 2a located above the metal plate 1<br>
and a lower induction coil 2b located below the metal plate 1 are located so as to be away<br><br>
from each other in the longitudinal direction of the metal plate and are parallel to each other. The distance L in the longitudinal direction between the upper and lower induction coils is kept constant in the traverse direction.<br>
[0060]	The upper induction coil 2a and the lower induction coil 2b are parallel<br>
to the transverse direction only in the central area and have an oblique (bent) portion respectively at the edge area where each of the induction coils stretches obliquely across the metal plate relative to the transverse direction. A necessary amount of heat divergence from the induction heating can be obtained by adjusting the distance between the upper and lower induction coils, since the heat divergence becomes larger as the distance becomes larger. The distance can be changed according to the temperature of the metal plate, which is measured by a thermometer located upstream of the induction heating apparatus.<br>
[0061]	Figure 13 shows another embodiment of the present invention for<br>
making the distance between the upper and lower induction coils changeable. In Figure<br>
13, an upper induction coil includes a plurality of edge area conductors a-a' and b-b' each<br>
of which is insulated and independent from each other. Each of the edge area conductors<br>
a-a' and b-b' is selectably connected to a central area connecting conductor 9b. The<br>
selectable connection can be performed using any well-known contact controller (not<br>
shown in Figure 13) such as an electromagnetic contactor, an air cylinder or a<br>
motor-driven cylinder.	j<br>
[0062]	The lower induction coil includes a plurality of edge area conductors<br>
A-A' and B-B' each of which is insulated and independent from each other. Each of the edge area conductors A-A' and B-B' is selectably connected to a central area connecting conductor 9c. A contact controller is not shown in Figure 13.<br><br>
 [0063]	In Figure 13, an upper induction coil located above the metal plate 1 and<br>
a lower induction coil located below the metal plate 1 are located so as to be away from each other in the longitudinal direction of the metal plate and are parallel to each other. The distance L in the longitudinal direction between the upper and lower induction coils is kept constant in the traverse direction. The upper induction coil and the lower induction coil have an oblique (bent) portion respectively at the edge area where each of the induction coils stretches obliquely across the metal plate at an oblique angle 9 relative to the transverse direction.<br>
[0064]	In  the  embodiment of Figure   13,  the  induction coil  is normally<br>
constructed by connecting conductors 9c, B-B', 9a, b-b' and 9b together. When a larger amount of heat divergence is needed, the induction coil is reconstructed by connecting conductors 9c, B-B', 9a, a-a' and 9b together so as to increase the distance between the upper and lower induction coils.<br>
[0065]	In the embodiment of Figure  13, to control the amount of heat<br>
divergence, a cross-sectional area of the conductor can be increased/decreased and/or a width of either the upper induction coil or the lower induction coil can be changed in addition to changing an amount of the distance between the upper and lower induction coils. For example, both of the conductors a-a' and b-b' can be selected together as the conductors to be energized.<br>
[0066]	The distance can be changed according to the temperature of the metal<br>
plate measured by a thermometer located upstream of the induction heating apparatus. A temperature deviation in the metal plate {(the temperature at the edge area)-(the temperature at the central area)} was examined using an induction coil constructed as shown in Figure 8. The metal plates that were examined were non-magnetic SUS304 steel plates (thickness: 0.2 mm, width: 600 mm and 800mm). The traveling speed of the<br>
 steel plate was 2 m/min. The AC power supply (not shown) of 25KHs and a capacitor having a capacitance of 100K.W was used. The capacitance of the capacitor was adjusted to match the induction coil to be used. An induction coil used was a single turn (surrounding the steel plate to be heated) of a water-cooled copper plate that was constructed of a copper plate (thickness: 5 mm, width: 100 mm) and a water-cooling copper tube (outer diameter: 10 mm, inner diameter: 8 mm) attached to the copper plate on the side (outer side) opposite to the steel plate by brazing. In this example, "induction coil" includes both the copper plate and the water-cooling copper tube, since the electric current also runs through the copper tube. A gap between the steel plate to be heated and the induction coil was 50 mm. The distance L between the upper induction coil and the lower induction coil was 200 mm. An oblique angle between the induction coil and transverse direction of the steel plate was 30 degrees. The central area of the induction coil was 200 mm long and parallel to the transverse direction of the steel plate. The temperature of the steel plate in the edge area was measured at a position 50 mm away from the edge of the steel plate using an infrared thermometer. TABLE 2 shows the temperature deviation with respect to both the 600 mm width plate and the 800 mm width plate.<br>
TABLE 2<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br><br>
 [0067]	The results show that overheating at the edge area of the steel plate is<br>
sufficiently restrained and the temperature deviation remains unchanged when the width of the steel plate changes.<br>
[0068]	The present invention is capable of heating a metal plate with high<br>
efficiency, even where the temperature of the metal plate is high above the Curie point, the<br>
metal plate is thin and/or the metal plate is made of a non-magnetic, non-ferrous metal<br>
with a low specific resistance such as aluminum or copper. The present invention is<br>
further capable of improving a non-uniform temperature distribution in the transverse<br>
direction of the metal plate, in particular overheating at an edge area of the metal plate.<br>
The present invention can make it easier to realize a desired temperature distribution even<br>
when the width of metal plate to be heated is changed without preparing a plurality of<br>
induction coils to cope with the width change. In addition, the present invention can<br>
improve a non-uniform temperature distribution caused by snaking of metal plate.<br>
[0069]	The invention being thus described, it will be obvious that the same may<br>
be varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and all such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of the following claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
