				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
 The present invention relates to personal care compositions with good lather and<br>
conditioning performance which comprise select synthetic copolymers.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Conditioning personal care compositions comprising various combinations of detersive surfactant and hair conditioning agents are known, 	These personal care compositions typically comprise an anionic detersive surfactant in combination with a conditioning agent such as silicone, hydrocarbon oil, fatty esters, or combinations thereof. These personal care compositions have become more popular among consumers as a means of conveniently obtaining hair conditioning and hair cleansing performance all from a single hair care product.<br>
Many conditioning personal care compositions, however, do not provide sufficient deposition of conditioning agents onto hair or skin during the application process; if deposition is possible, it is only possible in formulations with relatively low levels of anionic surfactant. Without such deposition, large proportions of conditioning agent are rinsed away during the application process and therefore provide little or no conditioning benefit. Without sufficient deposition of the conditioning agent on the hair or skin, relatively high levels of conditioning agents may be needed in the personal care composition to provide adequate hair or skin conditioning performance. Such high levels of a conditioning agent, however, can increase raw material costs, reduce lathering, and present product stability concerns. Additionally, limitations on total anionic surfactant in order to form coacervate can limit the lather potential for a formula, or result in the need for higher levels of more expensive amphoteric surfactants to achieve good lather.<br>
One known method for improving deposition of a hair conditioning agent onto hair involves the use of certain cationic deposition polymers. These polymers may be synthetic, but are most commonly natural cellulosic or guar polymers that have been modified with cationic substituents.<br>
The formation of coacervate upon dilution of the personal care composition with water is important to improving deposition of various conditioning actives, especially those that have small droplet sizes (ie. 
 <br>
the product is automatically diluted with water. In order to form coacervate, a personal care composition containing typical canonic polymers, such as natural cellulosic or guar polymers that have been modified with cationic substituents, tend to be significantly limited in total anion concentrations in order to achieve adequate levels of coacervate upon dilution. For example, limiting the total level of sulfate in a sulfated anionic surfactant will encourage coacervate formation but will limit the volume of lather that can be achieved with a particular personal care cleansing composition. Thus, for low cost, high lathering, coacervate forming compositions, it is desirable to use a cationic polymer that can form coacervate with higher levels of anionic surfactants.<br>
Therefore, a need still exists for personal care compositions which provide significant conditioning and lather performance.<br>
It has now been found that select synthetic cationic polymers enhance conditioning performance, especially wet hair conditioning, and improved deposition of dispersed hair conditioning agents onto hair or skin. These select polymers are especially effective at improving deposition of dispersed hair conditioning agents onto hair and skin, through coacervate formation upon dilution. In one embodiment, coacervate formation is optimized when formulated in combination with certain levels of anionic detersive surfactant in a personal care composition.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

a)        a synthetic random copolymer having a net positive charge comprising, based on the total number of monomelic units of the copolymer; i.)        a nonionic monomer unit of the following formula: R<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
where R is H or C1-4 alkyl; and R1 and R2 are independently selected from the group consisting of H, C1-4 alkyl, CH2OCH3, CH2OCH2CH(CH3)2, and phenyl, or together are C3-6 cycloalkyl; and<br>
ii.)       a cationic monomer unit with 2 or more positive charges of the following formula:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
to 6, w is zero or an integer of from 1 to 10, and X" is an anion, and;<br>
b)	a detersive surfactant; and<br>
c)	an aqueous carrier.<br>
One embodiment comprises an anionic surfactant system having an optimized ethoxylate level and anion level.<br>
These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the present invention will become evident to those skilled in the art from a reading of the present disclosure.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION While the specification concludes with claims that particularly point out and distinctly<br>
claim the invention, it is believed the present invention will be better understood from the<br>
following description.<br>
The personal care compositions of the present invention comprise a synthetic random copolymer, a detersive surfactant, and an aqueous carrier. Each of these essential components, as well as preferred or optional components, is described in detail hereinafter.<br>
All percentages, parts and ratios are based upon the total weight of the compositions of the present invention, unless otherwise specified. All such weights as they pertain to listed ingredients are based on the active level and, therefore, do not include solvents or by-products<br>
that may be included in commercially available materials, unless otherwise specified, The term "weight percent" may be denoted as "wt.%" herein.<br>
All molecular weights as used herein are weight average molecular weights expressed as grams/mole, unless otherwise specified.<br>
The term "charge density" as used herein, means the ratio of the number of positive charges on a monomeric unit of which a polymer is comprised to the molecular weight of said monomeric unit. The charge density multiplied by the polymer molecular weight determines the number of positively charged sites on a given polymer chain.<br>
The term "coacervate" as used herein, means the complex which forms between surfactant and polymer that may either be soluble or insoluble in the neat personal care composition, and which may become less soluble upon dilution and thus yielding an increase in its level of phase separation or precipitate in solution.<br>
The term "comprising" means that unrecited steps, elements or other ingredients are not necessarily excluded. This term encompasses the terms "consisting of and "consisting essentially of." The compositions and methods/processes can comprise, consist of, and consist essentially of the essential elements and limitations of the invention described herein, as well as any of the additional or optional ingredients, components, steps, or limitations described herein.<br>
The term "linear charge density" as used herein, means the ratio of the number of positive charges on a monomeric unit of which the polymer is comprised to the length in Angstroms of said monomeric unit. The length of the monomeric unit is calculated by multiplying the ratio of the nonionic monomer by the length, in Angstroms, of the nonionic monomer plus the ratio of cationic monomer multiplied by the length, in Angstroms, of the cationic monomer.<br>
The term "mass charge density" as used herein, means the ratio of the number of positive charges on a monomeric unit of which a polymer is comprised to the molecular weight of said monomeric unit. A molecular weight of the monomeric unit is calculated by multiplying the ratio of the nonionic monomer by the molecular weight of the nonionic monomer plus the product of the ratio of cationic monomer multiplied by the molecular weight of die cationic monomer.<br>
The term "neat" as used herein, means the unadulterated form of the personal care composition (i.e. the altering of the present composition through dilution with water).<br>
The term "polymer" as used herein shall comprise materials whemer made by polymerization of one type of monomer or made by two (i.e., copolymers) or more (i.e, terpolymers) types of monomers.<br>
The term "water insoluble" as used herein, means that the polymer is not soluble in water in the personal care composition. Thus, the polymer is not miscible with water. In general, solubility is determined at about 25°C.<br>
The term "water soluble" as used herein, means that the polymer is soluble in water in the personal care composition. In general, the polymer should be soluble at about 25° C at a concentration of at least about 0.1% by weight of the water solvent, preferably at least about 1%, more preferably at least about 5%, most preferably at least about 15%.<br>
One embodiment is directed to the surprising discovery that compositions combining certain specific levels and ratios of surfactant as described by the overall anion and ethoxylate values (described herein) maximize the conditioning benefit via maximization of coacervate formation. It has been discovered that the optimum surfactant composition can be described by two parameters. These parameters include anion and ethoxylate values that, when expressed as a function of the polymer's charge density and molecular weight, maximize the formation of coacervate.<br>
Coacervates, without being limited to a particular meory, provide improved hair and skin conditioning without any additional conditioning actives. Further, when dispersed conditioning agent droplets are added to the matrix, the coacervate provides an improved mechanism for conditioning agent deposition, yielding conditioning agent deposition that results in even more of a conditioning benefit. Synthetic Copolymer<br>
The personal care compositions comprise synthetic copolymers that, in combination with the detersive surfactant component, an aqueous carrier and other optional components herein, form coacervate upon dilution. The polymers are formulated in a personal care composition that provides suitable conditioning performance when formulated, even without additional conditioning actives, and also acts as a deposition aid for conditioning agent (described herein) onto the hair or skin. The monomer units of the synthetic copolymer may be arranged to form random copolymers and grafted copolymers. Random copolymers are preferred.<br>
The concentration of the synthetic copolymer in the shampoo composition ranges about 0.01% to about 5%, preferably from about 0.05% to about 3%, more preferably from about 0.075% to about 1%, by weight of the composition.<br>
Another embodiment comprises personal care compositions comprising a synthetic copolymer of sufficiently high molecular weight to effectively enhance the deposition of the conditioning active components of the personal care composition described herein. The average<br>
molecular weight of the synthetic copolymers is generally between about 10,000 and about 10 million, preferably between about 100,000 and about 3 million, still more preferably between about 200,000 and about 2 million.<br>
In a further embodiment, the synthetic copolymers have mass charge densities of from about 0.1 meq/gm to about 6.0 meq/gm and more preferably from about 0.5 meq/gm to about 3.0 meq/gm, at the pH of intended use of the personal care composition. The pH will generally range from about pH 3 to about pH 9, and more preferably between about pH 4 and about pH 8.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the synthetic copolymers have linear charge densities from at least about 2 meq/A to about 500 meq/A, and more preferably from about 20 meq/A to about 200 meq/ A, and most preferably from about 25 meq/A to about 100 meq/A.<br>
Nonionic Monomer Unit<br>
The synthetic copolymers comprise the nonionic monomer unit represented by the following Formula I: I.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where R is H or C1-4 alkyl; and R1 and R2 are independently selected from the group consisting of H, C1-4 alkyl, CH2OCH3, CH2OCH2CH(CH3)2, and phenyl, or together are C3-6cycloalkyl.<br>
In one embodiment, nonionic monomer unit is acrylamide (AM), i.e., where R, R1, and R2 are all H as shown below:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
Another preferred nonionic monomer unit is methacrylamide (MethAM), i.e., where R is C1alkyl, and R1 and R2 are each H respectively:<br>
in However, the other acrylamide derivatives within the scope of the formula set out above<br>
are also contemplated to be part of the present invention where polyacrylamide and copolymers<br>
using acrylamide monomers are useful.<br>
The nonionic monomer portion of the synthetic copolymers is present in an amount from<br>
about 50% to about 99.5% by weight of the total copolymer.  Preferably, this amount is from<br>
about, 70% to about 99%, still more preferably from about 80% to about 99% by weight of the<br>
synthetic copolymer.<br>
Cationic Monomer Unit<br>
The synthetic copolymers also comprise the cationic monomer unit represented by Formula II: 11.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where k = 1, each of v, v', and v"is independently an integer of from 1 to 6, w is zero or an integer of from 1 to 10, and X" is an anion.<br>
In one embodiment, a structure is present where k = 1, v = 3 and w = 0, z, = 1 and X" is C1" according to Formula II, above, to form the following structure:<br><br>
(Formula Removed) <br><br>
The above structure may be referred to as diquat.<br>

(Formula Removed) <br><br>
The above structure is may be referred to as triquat.<br>
Suitable cationic monomers can be made by, for example, the methods described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004/0010106 Al.<br>
In one embodiment, the cationic monomer portion of the synthetic copolymers is present in an amount from about 0.5% to about 50% by weight of the total copolymer. Preferably, this amount is from about, 1% to about 30% and most preferably from about 1% to about 20% by weight of the synthetic copolymer.<br>
Method of Making the Triquat Monomer<br>
Non limiting examples of polymerization techniques are described in U.S. Patent 4,387,017, RP 156,646 and U.S. Patent Publication 2004/0010106 Al.<br>
In one embodiment, the triquat monomer is formed by executing a three-step reaction in a jacketed reactor flask equipped with mechanical stirrer, gas inlet, condenser and thermometer. The mechanical stirring and air purging is maintained throughout the reactions. First, 340.52 g of dimethylaminopropyl methacrylamide (DMAPMA), 238.75 g of methyl chloroacetate, 0.34 g<br><br>
of 4-methoxyphenol (MEHQ) and 425 g of methanol are added to the reactor and heated at about 65-70°C for approximately 5 hours to yield (methacrylamidopropyl)(methoxy-carbonylmethyl)dimethylammonium chloride (MMDMAC). Samples are taken every 2 hours and analyzed by HPLC analysis and C1 titrated with AgNO3to ensure 100% conversion. Second, 0.365 g of MHHQ, and 224.5 g of dimethylaminopropylamine (DMAPA) is slowly added to MMDMAC solution after it is cooled to room temperature (about 25°C). An exothermic reaction is observed, and the mixture appears light yellow in color. Heat is continued at about 65-70°C for about 2 hours, then methanol is distilled out under vacuum After confirming that all ester is converted into amide by HPLC in the second step, 637 g of 65% (3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl)trimethylammonium chloride (Quat-188) is added. Third, the temperature is maintained at about 65-70°C for about 2 hours. The reaction is continued in water for another hour to yield the triquat monomer. The triquat so synthesized is expected to contain a small amount of multiple quats as an impurity due to the slight excess use of chloroacetate and DMAPA. The multiple quats are not a concern for polymerization and for the uses of the triquat. If a highly pure triquat or multiple quats is required, the excess amount of chloroacetate and DMAPA can be removed under vacuum.<br>
Detersive Surfactant<br>
The personal care compositions comprise a detersive surfactant system. The detersive surfactant system is included to provide cleaning performance to the composition. The detersive surfactant system comprises at least one anionic surfactant, and optionally an amphoteric surfactant, a zwitterionic surfactant, a cationic surfactant, a nonionic surfactant, or a combination thereof. Such surfactants should be physically and chemically compatible with the essential components described herein, or should not otherwise unduly impair product stability, aesthetics, or performance.<br>
Suitable anionic surfactant components for use in the personal care composition herein include those that are known for use in hair care or other personal care compositions. The concentration of the anionic surfactant system in the personal care composition should be sufficient to provide the desired cleaning and lather performance, and generally ranges from about 5% to about 50%, preferably from about 8% to about 30%, more preferably from about 10% to about 25%, by weight, of the composition.<br>
In considering the performance characteristics of a personal care composition, such as coacervate formation,  wet conditioning  performance,  dry  conditioning performance,  and<br><br>
conditioning agent deposition on hair, it is desirable to optimize the levels and types of surfactants in order to maximize the performance potential of polymer systems. In one embodiment, the anionic surfactant system for use in the personal care compositions have an ethoxylate level and an anion level, wherein the ethoxylate level is from about 1 to about 10, and wherein the anion level is from about 1 to about 10. The combination of such an anionic surfactant system with the synthetic copolymer provides enhanced deposition of conditioning agents to hair and/or skin without reducing cleansing or lathering performance.<br>
An optimal ethoxylate level is calculated based on the stoichiometry of the surfactant structure, which in turn is based on a particular molecular weight of the surfactant where the number of moles of ethoxylation is known. Likewise, given a specific molecular weight of a surfactant and an anionization reaction completion measurement, the anion level can be calculated. Analytical techniques have been developed to measure ethoxylation or anionization within surfactant systems. The Level of Ethoxylate and the Level of Anion representative of a particular surfactant system are calculated from the percent ethoxylation and percent anion of individual surfactants in the following manner:<br>
Level of Ethoxylate in a composition = percent ethoxylation multiplied by<br>
percent active ethoxylated surfactant  (based upon the total weight of the<br>
composition).<br>
Level of Anion in a composition = percent anion in ethoxylated surfactant<br>
multiplied by percent active ethoxylated surfactant (based upon the total weight<br>
of the composition) plus percent anion in non-ethoxylated surfactant multiplied<br>
by percent active non-ethoxylated surfactant (based upon the total weight of the<br>
composition).<br>
If a composition comprises two or more surfactants having different respective anions {e.g., surfactant A has a sulfate group and surfactant B has a sulfonate group), the Level of Anion in the composition is the sum of the molar levels of each respective anion as calculated above.<br>
Sample Calculation:<br>
Example I shows an ethoxylated surfactant that contains 0.294321%<br>
ethoxylate and 0.188307% sulfate as the anion and a non-ethoxylated surfactant<br>
that contains 0.266845% sulfate as an anion.<br><br>
Level of Ethoxylate in Example 1 = 0.294321 multiplied by 6 (% active ethoxylated surfactant). Thus, the Level of Ethoxylate in the composition of Example I is approximately 1.77.<br>
Level of Anion in Example I = 0.188307 multiplied by 6 (% active<br>
ethoxylated   surfactant)   plus   0.266845   multiplied   by   10   (%   active   non-<br>
ethoxylated surfactant). Thus, the Level of Anion in the composition of Example<br>
I is approximately 3.80.<br>
In one embodiment, the detersive surfactant system comprises at least one anionic surfactant comprising an anion selected from the group consisting of sulfates, sulfonates, sulfosuccinates, isethionates, carboxylates, phosphates, and phosphonates. Preferably, the anion is a sulfate.<br>
Examples of anionic surfactants for use in the personal care compositions include ammonium lauryl sulfate, ammonium laureth sulfate, triethylamine lauryl sulfate, triethylamine laureth sulfate, triethanolamine lauryl sulfate, triethanolamine laureth sulfate, monoethanolamine lauryl sulfate, monoethanolamine laureth sulfate, diethanolamine lauryl sulfate, diethanolamine laureth sulfate, lauric monoglyceride sodium sulfate, sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate, potassium lauryl sulfate, potassium laureth sulfate, sodium lauryl sarcosinate, sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, lauryl sarcosine, cocoyl sarcosine, ammonium cocoyl sulfate, ammonium lauroyl sulfate, sodium cocoyl sulfate, sodium lauroyl sulfate, potassium cocoyl sulfate, potassium lauryl sulfate, triethanolamine lauryl sulfate, triethanolamine lauryl sulfate, monoethanolamine cocoyl sulfate, monoethanolamine lauryl sulfate, and combinations thereof.<br>
In addition to the sulfates, isethionates, sulfonates, sulfosuccinates described above, other potential anions for the anionic surfactant include phosphonates, phosphates, and carboxylates.<br>
The personal care compositions may also comprise one or more additional surfactants selected from the group consisting of amphoteric surfactants, zwitterionic surfactants, cationic surfactants, and nonionic surfactants. Suitable amphoteric, zwitterionic, cationic, or nonionic surfactants for use in die personal care compositions herein include those which are known for use in hair care or other personal care compositions. The concentration of such surfactants preferably ranges from about 0.5% to about 20%, preferably from about 1% to about 10%, by weight of the composition. Non-limiting examples of suitable surfactants are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,104,646 and 5,106,609, both to Bolich, Jr. et al.<br><br>

Generally, such cellulose or guar cationic deposition polymers may be present at a concentration from about 0.05% to about 5%, by weight of the composition. Suitable cellulose or guar cationic deposition polymers have a molecular weight of greater than about 5,000. Additionally, such cellulose or guar deposition polymers have a charge density from about 0.5 meq/g to about 4.0 meq/g at the pH of intended use of the personal care composition, which pH will generally range from about pH 3 to about pH 9, preferably between about pH 4 and about pH 8. The pH of the compositions are measured neat.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the cellulose or guar cationic polymers are salts of hydroxyethyl cellulose reacted with trimethyl ammonium substituted epoxide, referred to in the industry (CTFA) as Polyquatcrnium 10 and available from Amcrchol Corp. (Edison, N.J., USA). Cationic Deposition Polymers<br>
In addition to the synthetic cationic copolymers of the present invention, the personal care compositions herein may also comprise additional synthetic cationic deposition polymers. Generally, such synthetic cationic deposition polymers may be present at a concentration from about 0.025% to about 5%, by weight of the composition. Such syndietic cationic deposition polymers have a molecular weight from about 1,000 to about 5,000,000. Additionally, such synthetic cationic deposition polymers have a charge density from about 0.5 meq/g to about 10 meq/g.<br><br>

Cationically Modified Starch Polymer<br>
In addition to the synthetic cationic copolymers of the present invention, the personal care compositions herein may also comprise additional water-soluble cationically modified starch polymers. As used herein, the term "cationically modified starch" refers to a starch to which a cationic group is added prior to degradation of die starch to a smaller molecular weight, or to a starch to which a cationic group is added after modification of the starch to a desired molecular weight. The definition of the term "cationically modified starch" also includes amphoterically modified starch. The term "amphoterically modified starch" refers to a starch hydrolysate to which a cationic group and an anionic group are added.<br>
In one embodiment, the personal care compositions comprise cationically modified starch polymers at a range of about 0.01% to about 10%, and more preferably from about 0.05% to about 5%, by weight of the composition.<br>
In one embodiment, the personal care compositions include cationically modified starch polymers which have a charge density from about 0.7 meq/g to about 7 meq/g. The chemical modification to obtain such a charge density includes, but is not limited to, the addition of amino and/or ammonium groups into the starch molecules.<br>
Non-limiting examples of suitable cationically modified starch polymers are described in United States Patent Application Publication US 10/758656 to Peffly et al. Oily Conditioning Agent<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the personal care compositions comprise one or more oily conditioning agents. Oily conditioning agents include materials which are used to give a particular conditioning benefit to hair and/or skin. In hair treatment compositions, suitable conditioning agents are those which deliver one or more benefits relating to shine, softness, combability, antistatic properties, wet-handling, damage, manageability, body, and grcasincss.<br><br>
The oily conditioning agents useful in the personal care compositions typically comprise a water-insoluble, water-dispersible, non-volatile, liquid that forms emulsified, liquid particles. Suitable oily conditioning agents for use in die composition are those conditioning agents characterized generally as silicones (e.g., silicone oils, cationic silicones, silicone gums, high refractive silicones, and silicone resins), organic conditioning oils {e.g., hydrocarbon oils, polyolefins, and fatty esters) or combinations thereof, or those conditioning agents which otherwise form liquid, dispersed particles in the aqueous surfactant matrix herein.<br>
One or more oily conditioning agents are typically present at a concentration from about 0.01% to about 10%, preferably from about 0.1% to about 8%, more preferably from about 0.2% to about 4%, by weight of the composition.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the ratio of oily conditioning agent to synthetic cationic polymer is at least about 2:1<br>
Non-limiting examples of suitable silicone conditioning agents, and optional suspending agents for the silicone, are described in U.S. Reissue Pat. No. 34,584, U.S. Pat. No. 5,104,646, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,106,609. The silicone conditioning agents for use in the personal care compositions preferably have a viscosity, as measured at 25°C, from about 20 to about 2,000,000 centistokes ("csk"), more preferably from about 1,000 to about 1,800,000 csk, even more preferably from about 5,000 to about 1,500,000 csk, more preferably from about 10,000 to about 1,000,000 csk.<br>
In one embodiment, the personal care composition is opaque. The personal care composition comprises a non-volatile silicone oil having a particle size as measured in the personal care composition from about 1 um to about 50 um. In an embodiment for small particle silicone application to the hair, the personal care composition comprises a non-volatile silicone oil having a particle size as measured in the personal care composition from about 100 nm to about 1 um. A substantially clear composition embodiment comprises a non-volatile silicone oil having a particle size as measured in the personal care composition of less than about 100 nm.<br>
The transparency of the composition is measured using Ultra-Violet/Visible (UV/VTS) Spectrophotometry, which determines the absorption or transmission of UV/VTS light by a sample. A light wavelength of 600 nm is adequate for characterizing the degree of clarity of cosmetic compositions. Typically, it is best to follow the specific instructions relating the specific spectrophotometer being used.    In general, the procedure for measuring percent<br><br>
transmittance starts by setting the spectrophotometer to the 600 nm. lhen a calibration "blank" is run to calibrate the readout to 100 percent transmittance. The test sample is then placed in a cuvette designed to fit die specific spectrophotomer and the percent transmittance is measured by the spectrophotomer at 600nm.<br>
Non-volatile silicone oils suitable for use in compositions may be selected from organo-modified silicones and fluoro-modified silicones. In one embodiment, the non-volatile silicone oil is an organo-modified silicone which comprises an organo group selected from the group consisting of alkyl groups, alkenyl groups, hydroxyl groups, amine groups, quaternary groups, carboxyl groups, fatty acid groups, ether groups, ester groups, mercapto groups, sulfate groups, sulfonate groups, phosphate groups, propylene oxide groups, and ethylene oxide groups.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the non-volatile silicone oil is dimethicone.<br>
Background material on silicones including sections discussing silicone fluids, gums, and resins, as well as manufacture of silicones, are found in Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Engineering, vol. 15, 2d ed., pp 204-308, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. (1989).<br>
Silicone fluids suitable for use in the personal care compositions are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 2,826,551, U.S. Pat. No. 3,964,500, U.S. Pat. No. 4,364,837, British Pat. No. 849,433, and Silicon Compounds, Petrarch Systems, Inc. (1984). Additional Components<br>
The personal care compositions may further comprise one or more additional components known for use in hair care or personal care products, provided that the additional components are physically and chemically compatible with the essential components described herein, or do not otherwise unduly impair product stability, aesthetics or performance. Individual concentrations of such additional components may range from about 0.001% to about 10% by weight of the personal care compositions.<br>
Non-limiting examples of additional components for use in the composition include natural cationic deposition polymers, synthetic cationic deposition polymers, anti-dandruff agents, particles, suspending agents, paraffinic hydrocarbons, propellants, viscosity modifiers, dyes, non-volatile solvents or diluents (water-soluble and water-insoluble), pearlescent aids, foam boosters, additional surfactants or nonionic cosurfactants, pediculocides, pH adjusting agents, perfumes, preservatives, chelants, proteins, skin active agents, sunscreens, UV absorbers, and vitamins.<br><br>
Mono or Divalent Salt<br>
The personal care compositions may further comprise a mono or divalent salt, which acts as a source of entropy to assist in coacervate formation. Salt allows more contacts to be made between the polymer and surfactant, which increases the formation of coacervate. By the term "coacervate initiator," as used herein, means salt capable of inducing the formation of coacervates when combined with compositions comprising an anionic detersive surfactant component surfactant system and the synthetic cationic polymer.<br>
Surfactant salts themselves are not included in the present salt definition but other salts are. Suitable salts comprise chlorides, phosphates, sulfates, nitrates, citrates and halides. The counter ions of such salts can be, but are not limited to, sodium, potassium, ammonium, magnesium, zinc or other mono and divalent cation. Salts most preferred for use in the compositions of the present invention include sodium chloride, ammonium chloride, sodium citrate, magnesium chloride, and magnesium sulfate. It is recognized that these salts may serve as thickening aids or buffering aids in addition to their role as a coacervate initiator. The amount of coacervate initiator comprising the salt and/or the optional surfactant will vary with the type of surfactant and polymer, but is preferably present at a level of from about 0.01% to about 5%, more preferably from about 0.05% to about 3.5%, and still more preferably from about 0.1% to about 2%.<br>
Method for Measuring Lather Volume<br>
The potential for the personal care compositions disclosed herein to generate lather is measured via the SITA Foam Tester (model: R-2000) made by SITA Messtechnik GmbH (Germany). The SITA Foam Tester R-2000 utilizes a patented rotor of defined geometry for foam generation. The rotor mechanically inserts air bubbles into the liquid. The foam volume is measured by an array of sensor needles, which scans Lhe foam surface. Using an array of sensor needles permits exact measurement of the foam volume even with uneven foam surfaces. The output is given as average millimeters of foam height per measure. Foam height measurements are taken every 10 seconds. The stir count and stir time refer to the input in the SITA program. The SITA program stirs for 10 sec then a measure is taken, then slirs again for 10 seconds a measure is taken - this occurs 12 times in total (stirred for 12 separate 10 sec. intervals). The Stir Count, as used herein, means the total number of stirring intervals in one test. It has been found that the 40 second measurement, the fourth total measurement, is particularly relevant to the consumer usage experience.  At the 40 second measurement, foam heights of at least about 50<br><br>
millimeters are particularly desirable, even more preferred are foam heights of at least about 100 millimeters.    To measure these values, standard manufacturer's mettiods are followed for operation of me equipment with the following requirements: Instrument Settings/Measurement Parameters:<br>

Water/Product/Soil load: 300 gm of 7 grain hardness water at 100 F 0.5 ml test product (cleansing composition) 0.05 ml Extra Virgin, first cold pressed Olive Oil (simulates sebum)<br>
The above materials may either be premixed prior to being fed into the SITA unit or the water may be metered in and the test product and soil may be injected into the SITA vessel either at the top of the vessel or through the injection port. Method of Making<br>
The personal care compositions may be made by mixing the ingredients together at either room temperature or at elevated temperature, e.g., about 72°C. Heat only needs to be used if solid ingredients are to be incorporated into the composition. The ingredients are mixed at the batch processing temperature. Additional ingredients, including electrolytes, polymers, fragrance, and particles, may be added to the product at room temperature.<br>

FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
 The present invention relates to personal care compositions with good lather and<br>
conditioning performance which comprise select synthetic copolymers.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Conditioning personal care compositions comprising various combinations of detersive surfactant and hair conditioning agents are known, 	These personal care compositions typically comprise an anionic detersive surfactant in combination with a conditioning agent such as silicone, hydrocarbon oil, fatty esters, or combinations thereof. These personal care compositions have become more popular among consumers as a means of conveniently obtaining hair conditioning and hair cleansing performance all from a single hair care product.<br>
Many conditioning personal care compositions, however, do not provide sufficient deposition of conditioning agents onto hair or skin during the application process; if deposition is possible, it is only possible in formulations with relatively low levels of anionic surfactant. Without such deposition, large proportions of conditioning agent are rinsed away during the application process and therefore provide little or no conditioning benefit. Without sufficient deposition of the conditioning agent on the hair or skin, relatively high levels of conditioning agents may be needed in the personal care composition to provide adequate hair or skin conditioning performance. Such high levels of a conditioning agent, however, can increase raw material costs, reduce lathering, and present product stability concerns. Additionally, limitations on total anionic surfactant in order to form coacervate can limit the lather potential for a formula, or result in the need for higher levels of more expensive amphoteric surfactants to achieve good lather.<br>
One known method for improving deposition of a hair conditioning agent onto hair involves the use of certain cationic deposition polymers. These polymers may be synthetic, but are most commonly natural cellulosic or guar polymers that have been modified with cationic substituents.<br>
The formation of coacervate upon dilution of the personal care composition with water is important to improving deposition of various conditioning actives, especially those that have small droplet sizes (ie. 
 <br>
the product is automatically diluted with water. In order to form coacervate, a personal care composition containing typical canonic polymers, such as natural cellulosic or guar polymers that have been modified with cationic substituents, tend to be significantly limited in total anion concentrations in order to achieve adequate levels of coacervate upon dilution. For example, limiting the total level of sulfate in a sulfated anionic surfactant will encourage coacervate formation but will limit the volume of lather that can be achieved with a particular personal care cleansing composition. Thus, for low cost, high lathering, coacervate forming compositions, it is desirable to use a cationic polymer that can form coacervate with higher levels of anionic surfactants.<br>
Therefore, a need still exists for personal care compositions which provide significant conditioning and lather performance.<br>
It has now been found that select synthetic cationic polymers enhance conditioning performance, especially wet hair conditioning, and improved deposition of dispersed hair conditioning agents onto hair or skin. These select polymers are especially effective at improving deposition of dispersed hair conditioning agents onto hair and skin, through coacervate formation upon dilution. In one embodiment, coacervate formation is optimized when formulated in combination with certain levels of anionic detersive surfactant in a personal care composition.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION While the specification concludes with claims that particularly point out and distinctly<br>
claim the invention, it is believed the present invention will be better understood from the<br>
following description.<br>
The personal care compositions of the present invention comprise a synthetic random copolymer, a detersive surfactant, and an aqueous carrier. Each of these essential components, as well as preferred or optional components, is described in detail hereinafter.<br>
All percentages, parts and ratios are based upon the total weight of the compositions of the present invention, unless otherwise specified. All such weights as they pertain to listed ingredients are based on the active level and, therefore, do not include solvents or by-products<br>
that may be included in commercially available materials, unless otherwise specified, The term "weight percent" may be denoted as "wt.%" herein.<br>
All molecular weights as used herein are weight average molecular weights expressed as grams/mole, unless otherwise specified.<br>
The term "charge density" as used herein, means the ratio of the number of positive charges on a monomeric unit of which a polymer is comprised to the molecular weight of said monomeric unit. The charge density multiplied by the polymer molecular weight determines the number of positively charged sites on a given polymer chain.<br>
The term "coacervate" as used herein, means the complex which forms between surfactant and polymer that may either be soluble or insoluble in the neat personal care composition, and which may become less soluble upon dilution and thus yielding an increase in its level of phase separation or precipitate in solution.<br>
The term "comprising" means that unrecited steps, elements or other ingredients are not necessarily excluded. This term encompasses the terms "consisting of and "consisting essentially of." The compositions and methods/processes can comprise, consist of, and consist essentially of the essential elements and limitations of the invention described herein, as well as any of the additional or optional ingredients, components, steps, or limitations described herein.<br>
The term "linear charge density" as used herein, means the ratio of the number of positive charges on a monomeric unit of which the polymer is comprised to the length in Angstroms of said monomeric unit. The length of the monomeric unit is calculated by multiplying the ratio of the nonionic monomer by the length, in Angstroms, of the nonionic monomer plus the ratio of cationic monomer multiplied by the length, in Angstroms, of the cationic monomer.<br>
The term "mass charge density" as used herein, means the ratio of the number of positive charges on a monomeric unit of which a polymer is comprised to the molecular weight of said monomeric unit. A molecular weight of the monomeric unit is calculated by multiplying the ratio of the nonionic monomer by the molecular weight of the nonionic monomer plus the product of the ratio of cationic monomer multiplied by the molecular weight of die cationic monomer.<br>
The term "neat" as used herein, means the unadulterated form of the personal care composition (i.e. the altering of the present composition through dilution with water).<br>
The term "polymer" as used herein shall comprise materials whemer made by polymerization of one type of monomer or made by two (i.e., copolymers) or more (i.e, terpolymers) types of monomers.<br>
The term "water insoluble" as used herein, means that the polymer is not soluble in water in the personal care composition. Thus, the polymer is not miscible with water. In general, solubility is determined at about 25°C.<br>
The term "water soluble" as used herein, means that the polymer is soluble in water in the personal care composition. In general, the polymer should be soluble at about 25° C at a concentration of at least about 0.1% by weight of the water solvent, preferably at least about 1%, more preferably at least about 5%, most preferably at least about 15%.<br>
One embodiment is directed to the surprising discovery that compositions combining certain specific levels and ratios of surfactant as described by the overall anion and ethoxylate values (described herein) maximize the conditioning benefit via maximization of coacervate formation. It has been discovered that the optimum surfactant composition can be described by two parameters. These parameters include anion and ethoxylate values that, when expressed as a function of the polymer's charge density and molecular weight, maximize the formation of coacervate.<br>
Coacervates, without being limited to a particular meory, provide improved hair and skin conditioning without any additional conditioning actives. Further, when dispersed conditioning agent droplets are added to the matrix, the coacervate provides an improved mechanism for conditioning agent deposition, yielding conditioning agent deposition that results in even more of a conditioning benefit. Synthetic Copolymer<br>
The personal care compositions comprise synthetic copolymers that, in combination with the detersive surfactant component, an aqueous carrier and other optional components herein, form coacervate upon dilution. The polymers are formulated in a personal care composition that provides suitable conditioning performance when formulated, even without additional conditioning actives, and also acts as a deposition aid for conditioning agent (described herein) onto the hair or skin. The monomer units of the synthetic copolymer may be arranged to form random copolymers and grafted copolymers. Random copolymers are preferred.<br>
The concentration of the synthetic copolymer in the shampoo composition ranges about 0.01% to about 5%, preferably from about 0.05% to about 3%, more preferably from about 0.075% to about 1%, by weight of the composition.<br>
Another embodiment comprises personal care compositions comprising a synthetic copolymer of sufficiently high molecular weight to effectively enhance the deposition of the conditioning active components of the personal care composition described herein. The average<br>
molecular weight of the synthetic copolymers is generally between about 10,000 and about 10 million, preferably between about 100,000 and about 3 million, still more preferably between about 200,000 and about 2 million.<br>
In a further embodiment, the synthetic copolymers have mass charge densities of from about 0.1 meq/gm to about 6.0 meq/gm and more preferably from about 0.5 meq/gm to about 3.0 meq/gm, at the pH of intended use of the personal care composition. The pH will generally range from about pH 3 to about pH 9, and more preferably between about pH 4 and about pH 8.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the synthetic copolymers have linear charge densities from at least about 2 meq/A to about 500 meq/A, and more preferably from about 20 meq/A to about 200 meq/ A, and most preferably from about 25 meq/A to about 100 meq/A.<br>

In one embodiment, nonionic monomer unit is acrylamide (AM), i.e., where R, R1, and R2 are all H as shown below:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
Another preferred nonionic monomer unit is methacrylamide (MethAM), i.e., where R is C1alkyl, and R1 and R2 are each H respectively:<br>
in However, the other acrylamide derivatives within the scope of the formula set out above<br>
are also contemplated to be part of the present invention where polyacrylamide and copolymers<br>
using acrylamide monomers are useful.<br>
The nonionic monomer portion of the synthetic copolymers is present in an amount from<br>
about 50% to about 99.5% by weight of the total copolymer.  Preferably, this amount is from<br>
about, 70% to about 99%, still more preferably from about 80% to about 99% by weight of the<br>
synthetic copolymer.<br>
Cationic Monomer Unit<br>

The above structure is may be referred to as triquat.<br>
Suitable cationic monomers can be made by, for example, the methods described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004/0010106 Al.<br>
In one embodiment, the cationic monomer portion of the synthetic copolymers is present in an amount from about 0.5% to about 50% by weight of the total copolymer. Preferably, this amount is from about, 1% to about 30% and most preferably from about 1% to about 20% by weight of the synthetic copolymer.<br>
Method of Making the Triquat Monomer<br>
Non limiting examples of polymerization techniques are described in U.S. Patent 4,387,017, RP 156,646 and U.S. Patent Publication 2004/0010106 Al.<br>
In one embodiment, the triquat monomer is formed by executing a three-step reaction in a jacketed reactor flask equipped with mechanical stirrer, gas inlet, condenser and thermometer. The mechanical stirring and air purging is maintained throughout the reactions. First, 340.52 g of dimethylaminopropyl methacrylamide (DMAPMA), 238.75 g of methyl chloroacetate, 0.34 g<br><br>
of 4-methoxyphenol (MEHQ) and 425 g of methanol are added to the reactor and heated at about 65-70°C for approximately 5 hours to yield (methacrylamidopropyl)(methoxy-carbonylmethyl)dimethylammonium chloride (MMDMAC). Samples are taken every 2 hours and analyzed by HPLC analysis and C1 titrated with AgNO3to ensure 100% conversion. Second, 0.365 g of MHHQ, and 224.5 g of dimethylaminopropylamine (DMAPA) is slowly added to MMDMAC solution after it is cooled to room temperature (about 25°C). An exothermic reaction is observed, and the mixture appears light yellow in color. Heat is continued at about 65-70°C for about 2 hours, then methanol is distilled out under vacuum After confirming that all ester is converted into amide by HPLC in the second step, 637 g of 65% (3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl)trimethylammonium chloride (Quat-188) is added. Third, the temperature is maintained at about 65-70°C for about 2 hours. The reaction is continued in water for another hour to yield the triquat monomer. The triquat so synthesized is expected to contain a small amount of multiple quats as an impurity due to the slight excess use of chloroacetate and DMAPA. The multiple quats are not a concern for polymerization and for the uses of the triquat. If a highly pure triquat or multiple quats is required, the excess amount of chloroacetate and DMAPA can be removed under vacuum.<br>
Detersive Surfactant<br>
The personal care compositions comprise a detersive surfactant system. The detersive surfactant system is included to provide cleaning performance to the composition. The detersive surfactant system comprises at least one anionic surfactant, and optionally an amphoteric surfactant, a zwitterionic surfactant, a cationic surfactant, a nonionic surfactant, or a combination thereof. Such surfactants should be physically and chemically compatible with the essential components described herein, or should not otherwise unduly impair product stability, aesthetics, or performance.<br>
Suitable anionic surfactant components for use in the personal care composition herein include those that are known for use in hair care or other personal care compositions. The concentration of the anionic surfactant system in the personal care composition should be sufficient to provide the desired cleaning and lather performance, and generally ranges from about 5% to about 50%, preferably from about 8% to about 30%, more preferably from about 10% to about 25%, by weight, of the composition.<br>
In considering the performance characteristics of a personal care composition, such as coacervate formation,  wet conditioning  performance,  dry  conditioning performance,  and<br><br>
conditioning agent deposition on hair, it is desirable to optimize the levels and types of surfactants in order to maximize the performance potential of polymer systems. In one embodiment, the anionic surfactant system for use in the personal care compositions have an ethoxylate level and an anion level, wherein the ethoxylate level is from about 1 to about 10, and wherein the anion level is from about 1 to about 10. The combination of such an anionic surfactant system with the synthetic copolymer provides enhanced deposition of conditioning agents to hair and/or skin without reducing cleansing or lathering performance.<br>
An optimal ethoxylate level is calculated based on the stoichiometry of the surfactant structure, which in turn is based on a particular molecular weight of the surfactant where the number of moles of ethoxylation is known. Likewise, given a specific molecular weight of a surfactant and an anionization reaction completion measurement, the anion level can be calculated. Analytical techniques have been developed to measure ethoxylation or anionization within surfactant systems. The Level of Ethoxylate and the Level of Anion representative of a particular surfactant system are calculated from the percent ethoxylation and percent anion of individual surfactants in the following manner:<br>
Level of Ethoxylate in a composition = percent ethoxylation multiplied by<br>
percent active ethoxylated surfactant  (based upon the total weight of the<br>
composition).<br>
Level of Anion in a composition = percent anion in ethoxylated surfactant<br>
multiplied by percent active ethoxylated surfactant (based upon the total weight<br>
of the composition) plus percent anion in non-ethoxylated surfactant multiplied<br>
by percent active non-ethoxylated surfactant (based upon the total weight of the<br>
composition).<br>
If a composition comprises two or more surfactants having different respective anions {e.g., surfactant A has a sulfate group and surfactant B has a sulfonate group), the Level of Anion in the composition is the sum of the molar levels of each respective anion as calculated above.<br>
Sample Calculation:<br>
Example I shows an ethoxylated surfactant that contains 0.294321%<br>
ethoxylate and 0.188307% sulfate as the anion and a non-ethoxylated surfactant<br>
that contains 0.266845% sulfate as an anion.<br><br>
Level of Ethoxylate in Example 1 = 0.294321 multiplied by 6 (% active ethoxylated surfactant). Thus, the Level of Ethoxylate in the composition of Example I is approximately 1.77.<br>
Level of Anion in Example I = 0.188307 multiplied by 6 (% active<br>
ethoxylated   surfactant)   plus   0.266845   multiplied   by   10   (%   active   non-<br>
ethoxylated surfactant). Thus, the Level of Anion in the composition of Example<br>
I is approximately 3.80.<br>
In one embodiment, the detersive surfactant system comprises at least one anionic surfactant comprising an anion selected from the group consisting of sulfates, sulfonates, sulfosuccinates, isethionates, carboxylates, phosphates, and phosphonates. Preferably, the anion is a sulfate.<br>

Non-limiting examples of suitable synthetic cationic deposition polymers are described in United States Patent Application Publication US 2003/0223951 Al to Geary et al.<br>
Cationically Modified Starch Polymer<br>
In addition to the synthetic cationic copolymers of the present invention, the personal care compositions herein may also comprise additional water-soluble cationically modified starch polymers. As used herein, the term "cationically modified starch" refers to a starch to which a cationic group is added prior to degradation of die starch to a smaller molecular weight, or to a starch to which a cationic group is added after modification of the starch to a desired molecular weight. The definition of the term "cationically modified starch" also includes amphoterically modified starch. The term "amphoterically modified starch" refers to a starch hydrolysate to which a cationic group and an anionic group are added.<br>
In one embodiment, the personal care compositions comprise cationically modified starch polymers at a range of about 0.01% to about 10%, and more preferably from about 0.05% to about 5%, by weight of the composition.<br>
In one embodiment, the personal care compositions include cationically modified starch polymers which have a charge density from about 0.7 meq/g to about 7 meq/g. The chemical modification to obtain such a charge density includes, but is not limited to, the addition of amino and/or ammonium groups into the starch molecules.<br>
Non-limiting examples of suitable cationically modified starch polymers are described in United States Patent Application Publication US 10/758656 to Peffly et al. Oily Conditioning Agent<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the personal care compositions comprise one or more oily conditioning agents. Oily conditioning agents include materials which are used to give a particular conditioning benefit to hair and/or skin. In hair treatment compositions, suitable conditioning agents are those which deliver one or more benefits relating to shine, softness, combability, antistatic properties, wet-handling, damage, manageability, body, and grcasincss.<br><br>
The oily conditioning agents useful in the personal care compositions typically comprise a water-insoluble, water-dispersible, non-volatile, liquid that forms emulsified, liquid particles. Suitable oily conditioning agents for use in die composition are those conditioning agents characterized generally as silicones (e.g., silicone oils, cationic silicones, silicone gums, high refractive silicones, and silicone resins), organic conditioning oils {e.g., hydrocarbon oils, polyolefins, and fatty esters) or combinations thereof, or those conditioning agents which otherwise form liquid, dispersed particles in the aqueous surfactant matrix herein.<br>
One or more oily conditioning agents are typically present at a concentration from about 0.01% to about 10%, preferably from about 0.1% to about 8%, more preferably from about 0.2% to about 4%, by weight of the composition.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the ratio of oily conditioning agent to synthetic cationic polymer is at least about 2:1<br>
Non-limiting examples of suitable silicone conditioning agents, and optional suspending agents for the silicone, are described in U.S. Reissue Pat. No. 34,584, U.S. Pat. No. 5,104,646, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,106,609. The silicone conditioning agents for use in the personal care compositions preferably have a viscosity, as measured at 25°C, from about 20 to about 2,000,000 centistokes ("csk"), more preferably from about 1,000 to about 1,800,000 csk, even more preferably from about 5,000 to about 1,500,000 csk, more preferably from about 10,000 to about 1,000,000 csk.<br>
In one embodiment, the personal care composition is opaque. The personal care composition comprises a non-volatile silicone oil having a particle size as measured in the personal care composition from about 1 um to about 50 um. In an embodiment for small particle silicone application to the hair, the personal care composition comprises a non-volatile silicone oil having a particle size as measured in the personal care composition from about 100 nm to about 1 um. A substantially clear composition embodiment comprises a non-volatile silicone oil having a particle size as measured in the personal care composition of less than about 100 nm.<br>
The transparency of the composition is measured using Ultra-Violet/Visible (UV/VTS) Spectrophotometry, which determines the absorption or transmission of UV/VTS light by a sample. A light wavelength of 600 nm is adequate for characterizing the degree of clarity of cosmetic compositions. Typically, it is best to follow the specific instructions relating the specific spectrophotometer being used.    In general, the procedure for measuring percent<br><br>
transmittance starts by setting the spectrophotometer to the 600 nm. lhen a calibration "blank" is run to calibrate the readout to 100 percent transmittance. The test sample is then placed in a cuvette designed to fit die specific spectrophotomer and the percent transmittance is measured by the spectrophotomer at 600nm.<br>
Non-volatile silicone oils suitable for use in compositions may be selected from organo-modified silicones and fluoro-modified silicones. In one embodiment, the non-volatile silicone oil is an organo-modified silicone which comprises an organo group selected from the group consisting of alkyl groups, alkenyl groups, hydroxyl groups, amine groups, quaternary groups, carboxyl groups, fatty acid groups, ether groups, ester groups, mercapto groups, sulfate groups, sulfonate groups, phosphate groups, propylene oxide groups, and ethylene oxide groups.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the non-volatile silicone oil is dimethicone.<br>
Background material on silicones including sections discussing silicone fluids, gums, and resins, as well as manufacture of silicones, are found in Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Engineering, vol. 15, 2d ed., pp 204-308, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. (1989).<br>
Silicone fluids suitable for use in the personal care compositions are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 2,826,551, U.S. Pat. No. 3,964,500, U.S. Pat. No. 4,364,837, British Pat. No. 849,433, and Silicon Compounds, Petrarch Systems, Inc. (1984). Additional Components<br>
The personal care compositions may further comprise one or more additional components known for use in hair care or personal care products, provided that the additional components are physically and chemically compatible with the essential components described herein, or do not otherwise unduly impair product stability, aesthetics or performance. Individual concentrations of such additional components may range from about 0.001% to about 10% by weight of the personal care compositions.<br>
Non-limiting examples of additional components for use in the composition include natural cationic deposition polymers, synthetic cationic deposition polymers, anti-dandruff agents, particles, suspending agents, paraffinic hydrocarbons, propellants, viscosity modifiers, dyes, non-volatile solvents or diluents (water-soluble and water-insoluble), pearlescent aids, foam boosters, additional surfactants or nonionic cosurfactants, pediculocides, pH adjusting agents, perfumes, preservatives, chelants, proteins, skin active agents, sunscreens, UV absorbers, and vitamins.<br><br>
Mono or Divalent Salt<br>
The personal care compositions may further comprise a mono or divalent salt, which acts as a source of entropy to assist in coacervate formation. Salt allows more contacts to be made between the polymer and surfactant, which increases the formation of coacervate. By the term "coacervate initiator," as used herein, means salt capable of inducing the formation of coacervates when combined with compositions comprising an anionic detersive surfactant component surfactant system and the synthetic cationic polymer.<br>
Surfactant salts themselves are not included in the present salt definition but other salts are. Suitable salts comprise chlorides, phosphates, sulfates, nitrates, citrates and halides. The counter ions of such salts can be, but are not limited to, sodium, potassium, ammonium, magnesium, zinc or other mono and divalent cation. Salts most preferred for use in the compositions of the present invention include sodium chloride, ammonium chloride, sodium citrate, magnesium chloride, and magnesium sulfate. It is recognized that these salts may serve as thickening aids or buffering aids in addition to their role as a coacervate initiator. The amount of coacervate initiator comprising the salt and/or the optional surfactant will vary with the type of surfactant and polymer, but is preferably present at a level of from about 0.01% to about 5%, more preferably from about 0.05% to about 3.5%, and still more preferably from about 0.1% to about 2%.<br>
Method for Measuring Lather Volume<br>
The potential for the personal care compositions disclosed herein to generate lather is measured via the SITA Foam Tester (model: R-2000) made by SITA Messtechnik GmbH (Germany). The SITA Foam Tester R-2000 utilizes a patented rotor of defined geometry for foam generation. The rotor mechanically inserts air bubbles into the liquid. The foam volume is measured by an array of sensor needles, which scans Lhe foam surface. Using an array of sensor needles permits exact measurement of the foam volume even with uneven foam surfaces. The output is given as average millimeters of foam height per measure. Foam height measurements are taken every 10 seconds. The stir count and stir time refer to the input in the SITA program. The SITA program stirs for 10 sec then a measure is taken, then slirs again for 10 seconds a measure is taken - this occurs 12 times in total (stirred for 12 separate 10 sec. intervals). The Stir Count, as used herein, means the total number of stirring intervals in one test. It has been found that the 40 second measurement, the fourth total measurement, is particularly relevant to the consumer usage experience.  At the 40 second measurement, foam heights of at least about 50<br><br>
millimeters are particularly desirable, even more preferred are foam heights of at least about 100 millimeters.    To measure these values, standard manufacturer's mettiods are followed for operation of me equipment with the following requirements: Instrument Settings/Measurement Parameters:<br>

Water/Product/Soil load: 300 gm of 7 grain hardness water at 100 F 0.5 ml test product (cleansing composition) 0.05 ml Extra Virgin, first cold pressed Olive Oil (simulates sebum)<br>
The above materials may either be premixed prior to being fed into the SITA unit or the water may be metered in and the test product and soil may be injected into the SITA vessel either at the top of the vessel or through the injection port. Method of Making<br>
The personal care compositions may be made by mixing the ingredients together at either room temperature or at elevated temperature, e.g., about 72°C. Heat only needs to be used if solid ingredients are to be incorporated into the composition. The ingredients are mixed at the batch processing temperature. Additional ingredients, including electrolytes, polymers, fragrance, and particles, may be added to the product at room temperature.<br>
