				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a method for charging<br>
material into a blast furnace, in particular, a method for<br>
charging iron ore and coke into a blast furnace by use of a<br>
bell-less charging device.<br>
In general, in a blast furnace that manufactures-molten<br>
iron, from a furnace top, iron ores and coke are alternately<br>
charged, and thereby in an upper furnace part (hereinafter,<br>
referred to as shaft) a charged layer having a layer structure<br>
thereof is formed. Amounts of one layer of iron ores and one<br>
layer of coke are called one charge of iron ores and one charge<br>
of coke, respectively. Each of the one charge of iron ores<br>
and one charge of coke is not necessarily charged at one time<br>
into the furnace and, in some cases, is charged into the<br>
furnace divided into a plurality of times. The divided ores<br>
and divided coke are respectively called as one batch of ores<br>
and one batch of coke. Furthermore, from a furnace bottom<br>
part of the blast furnace, air or oxygen-enriched air is blown<br>
into the furnace to burn the coke in the furnace, and, with<br>
a high temperature reducing gas generated by this burning,<br>
the iron ores in the shaft (hereinafter, simply referred to<br>
as ore) are reduced and molten. Accordingly, in order to<br>
improve the productivity of the blast furnace, it is very<br>
important to reduce the permeability resistance of the<br>
charged layer of ore and coke in the shaft.<br>
As one means effective in reducing the permeability<br>
resistance in the shaft, so far, it is known to mix ore and<br>
coke and pile it in the furnace. For instance, Japanese Patent<br>
No.2820478 discloses a method in which by devising<br>
discharging timings and amounts of ore and coke from an ore<br>
hopper and a coke hopper, in a bell-less blast furnace, the<br>
coke is uniformly mixed in the ore.<br>
Furthermore, as one means for inhibiting the<br>
permeability resistance in the blast furnace from increasing<br>
and thereby stably maintaining a gas flow in the blast furnace,<br>
it is known effective to charge coke in a center part of the<br>
blast furnace so that a flow rate distribution of a gas going<br>
up in the blast furnace may become large in the center part<br>
(this is called center flow tendency). For instance, JP-A<br>
No.60-56003 discloses a technology in which from 1.5 to 8%<br>
by weight of coke that is charged in one charge is intensively<br>
charged in the center part of a furnace. The center charge<br>
of coke has not only an effect of reducing the permeability<br>
resistance in the furnace but also an effect of avoiding or<br>
reducing the deterioration of coke due to so-called solution<br>
loss reaction in which, since ore is not so much present in<br>
the center part of the furnace, carbon dioxide generated by<br>
the reduction of ore oxidizes coke. Furthermore, a strength<br>
control value of the coke itself can be lowered and thereby<br>
enabling to use cheap and low quality coal; accordingly,<br>
material coal for the manufacture of coke can be reduced in<br>
cost. Still furthermore, since a particle diameter of coke<br>
of a so-called furnace core (it is also called a dead-man)<br>
that is formed on a furnace bed can be inhibited from being<br>
unnecessarily reduced, it is helpful in improving the liquid<br>
permeability of the molten iron at the furnace hearth.<br>
Accordingly, when the above-mentioned mix charge<br>
(hereinafter, simply referred to as mix charge) of ore and<br>
coke and the center charge of coke are combined, a synergy<br>
effect that the permeability resistance of the shaft part can<br>
be more than ever reduced and the productivity can be improved<br>
can be expected.<br>
However, in order to combine the mix charge and the<br>
center charge of coke in the same charge, specifically, the<br>
discharge from a material hopper has to be carried out divided<br>
in three batches of a batch for normal charge of coke, a batch<br>
for center charge of coke and a batch for mix charge. This<br>
means that when the coke for one charge is charged into the<br>
furnace, the cokes have to be transported to a furnace top<br>
three times. That is, a time necessary for charging the coke<br>
for one charge becomes longer. Accordingly, even when the<br>
productivity of the blast furnace is necessary to increase,<br>
since the furnace top transporting capacity of material<br>
becomes deficient to a charge amount of the material, a<br>
situation that the material cannot be charged in time occurs.<br>
In such a case, since the simultaneous implementation of the<br>
center charge and the mix charge of coke has to be abandoned,<br>
advantages due to the use of cheap material coal due to the<br>
implementation of both cannot be enjoyed.<br>
In addition to the above, it is difficult to maintain<br>
various properties and states such as a particle size<br>
distribution and a content of moisture of ores and coke used<br>
in a blast furnace or blending ratios of ore kinds always at<br>
constant levels. For instance, when a blending ratio of a<br>
sticky ore in the ores varies, according to the technology<br>
disclosed in Japanese Patent No. 2820478, a behavior of a pile<br>
charged in a furnace top bunker varies, and a blending ratio<br>
of ore and coke in a material discharged from an outlet at<br>
a lower portion of the furnace top bunker varies.<br>
As one means for making a particle diameter of the<br>
furnace core coke in the furnace bed larger and thereby<br>
improving the liquid permeability at the furnace bed, other<br>
than the center charge of the coke, it is considered to make<br>
a particle diameter of coke that is charged in the center part<br>
larger. That is, instead of inhibiting the ore from piling<br>
in the furnace center part in the coke center charge and<br>
thereby inhibiting the coke from being consumed owing to the<br>
solution loss reaction in the furnace center part, when a<br>
particle diameter of coke is made larger in the furnace center<br>
part than in a furnace periphery part, even when the solution<br>
loss reaction occurs, the particle diameter of coke can be<br>
inhibited from being reduced in the furnace core of the<br>
furnace bed. When a coke charging device dedicated to the<br>
center charge of coke is used, by previously making larger<br>
the particle diameter of coke being charged through the<br>
charging device, the particle diameter of coke in such a<br>
furnace center part can be enlarged. However, installation<br>
of a charging device that is exclusively used for the center<br>
charge of coke and different from an ordinary material<br>
charging device requires large equipment expenses.<br>
Furthermore, even in the case of the coke large in the particle<br>
diameter being charged in the furnace center part through a<br>
bell-less charging device, at present, the coke large in the<br>
particle diameter is previously prepared in a batch different<br>
from a batch of coke having a normal particle diameter<br>
followed by transporting to a bunker disposed at the furnace<br>
top further followed by charging in the furnace. Accordingly,<br>
the number of batches of coke and ore that are charged in one<br>
charge increases. An increase in the number of batches by<br>
which material for one charge is charged in the furnace<br>
determines a rate when the productivity is improved;<br>
accordingly, it is a very large problem.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

EMBODIMENTS FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The inventors studied hard to achieve the above<br>
respective objects and embodied fruits thereof in the present<br>
invention.<br>
That is, the invention is a method of charging material<br>
in a bell-less blast furnace (embodiment 1) , the method being<br>
characterized in that when a chute of a bell-less charging<br>
device of a blast furnace is rotated with a inclination angle<br>
thereof varying and thereby coke or ore stored in a plurality<br>
of furnace top bunkers is charged from a furnace center part<br>
toward a furnace wall part in a radius direction in the furnace,<br>
from a predetermined time point where a discharge amount of<br>
coke stored in one of the furnace top bunkers is between 5<br>
to 50% by mass of a coke charge amount for one batch, ore stored<br>
in another furnace top bunker is started to discharge, and<br>
thereby the coke and ore are simultaneously charged.<br>
In the embodiment 1, the chute of the bell-less charging<br>
device of a blast furnace is rotated with a inclination angle<br>
thereof increasing sequentially and stepwise from zero that<br>
is a vertical state; when a discharge amount of coke stored<br>
in one of furnace top bunkers becomes in the range of 5 to<br>
50% by mass of a coke charge amount for one batch, discharge<br>
of ore stored in another furnace top bunker is begun; and<br>
thereby the coke and ore are simultaneously charged.<br>
Accordingly, in the neighborhood of the furnace center part<br>
only the coke is filled; and on a furnace wall side in the<br>
surroundings thereof, a mixture of the coke and ore is filled.<br>
As a result, the mix charge of the coke and ore, without<br>
interrupting owing to the transporting capacity of material<br>
of the furnace top, can be always smoothly carried out.<br>
The present invention is a method of charging material<br>
in a bell-less blast furnace (hereinafter referred to as<br>
embodiment 2) , the method, in a material charging method of<br>
a bell-less blast furnace where by use of a bell-less charging<br>
device ore and coke as material are charged in a blast furnace,<br>
being characterized in that a mixed material obtained by<br>
mixing ore and coke is stored in one of furnace top bunkers;<br>
and, by rotating a charging chute about a blast furnace<br>
neutral axis and sequentially varying a inclination angle of<br>
the charging chute, during at least one reciprocation of the<br>
charging chute in a radius direction in the blast furnace,<br>
the whole amount of the mixed material stored in the furnace<br>
top bunker is charged in the blast furnace.<br>
As a preferable mode in the embodiment 2, the charging<br>
chute preferably starts charging the mixed material either<br>
from a furnace wall side of the blast furnace or from a blast<br>
furnace center side.<br>
The invention is a material charging method of a<br>
bell-less blast furnace (hereinafter referred to as<br>
embodiment 3) , the method, in a material charging method of<br>
a bell-less blast furnace in which ore and/or coke is charged<br>
in a blast furnace as material by use of a bell-less charging<br>
device, being characterized in that when coke is charged in<br>
the center part of the bell-less blast furnace by use of a<br>
charging chute, with respect to a dimensionless radius where<br>
a furnace center part of the bell-less blast furnace is<br>
assigned to zero and a furnace wall part to 1, from a radius<br>
position corresponding to 0.1 to 0.4, the coke is begun<br>
charging followed by continuing charging while sequentially<br>
moving an inclination angle of the charging chute toward a<br>
furnace center side for each rotation thereof.<br>
The invention is a material charging method of a<br>
bell-less blast furnace (hereinafter referred to as<br>
embodiment 4), the method being characterized in that when<br>
coke stored in a plurality of coke bins is discharged and<br>
sifted with a screen disposed at a lower part of each of the<br>
bins and coke above the screen is charged sequentially through<br>
a weighing hopper, a bunker disposed at the furnace top and<br>
a chute of a bell-less charging device into a blast furnace<br>
with the chute rotating from a furnace center part toward a<br>
furnace wall side, when screen mesh of screens disposed at<br>
lower parts of some of the coke bins is made larger than that<br>
of the other coke bins and the coke is transferred from these<br>
coke bins to the weighing hopper, after, firstly, a<br>
predetermined amount of the coke from the coke bins large in<br>
the screen mesh is transferred to the weighing hopper,<br>
subsequently the coke from the other coke bins is transferred<br>
followed by weighing the coke for one batch further followed<br>
by charging through the bunker into a blast furnace.<br>
In this case, an amount of coke from the coke bins large<br>
in the screen mesh is preferably in the range of 5 to 50% by<br>
mass relative to the whole amount of coke of the batch<br>
(hereinafter referred to as embodiment 5).<br>
According to embodiments 4 and 5, without separately<br>
disposing a charging device exclusive for coke but with an<br>
existing bell-less charging device, without increasing the<br>
number of batches of material, coke large in the particle<br>
diameter than one that is charged in the periphery part can<br>
be selectively charged in the center part of the blast<br>
furnace.<br>
Preferably, in embodiments 1 through 5, in a material<br>
charging method of a bell-less blast furnace (hereinafter<br>
referred to as embodiment 6), at least three of the furnace<br>
top bunkers are disposed in parallel.<br>
Embodiment 1<br>
In what follows, embodiment 1 according to the present<br>
invention will be explained with reference to the drawings.<br>
Firstly, a longitudinal sectional view of a furnace top<br>
part of a blast furnace provided with a bell-less charging<br>
device is shown in Fig.1. Material 2 (ore or coke) stored<br>
in a furnace top bunker 1 falls through a gate that is called<br>
a flow rate control gate 3 and controls a discharge amount<br>
with an opening thereof and is supplied through a vertical<br>
chute 4 into a chute that can freely rotate (usually called<br>
a charging chute 5). The charging chute 5 can rotate in a<br>
horizontal direction about a neutral axis 7 of a blast furnace<br>
6 and can alter a inclination angle (0) thereof relative to<br>
the neutral axis 7. When with the charging chute 5 rotating<br>
during charge of the material, the inclination angle 9 is<br>
sequentially and stepwise varied, the material can be charged<br>
in the furnace with a wide pile surface formed. Usually, as<br>
the inclination angle 9, a large number of angles are<br>
previously set and notch numbers are assigned to the<br>
respective angles. Thereby, in charging the material 2 with<br>
the charging chute 5 rotating, when from the charge start the<br>
notches in the respective rotations are determined, the same<br>
kind of material can be always charged at a constant position.<br>
Furthermore, as to the furnace top bunker 1, two of la and<br>
1b are shown in Fig.1; however, there are cases of three or<br>
more, and in each thereof material 2 for one batch can be<br>
transported and stored.<br>
Embodiment 1 is a blast furnace material charging method<br>
that uses such bell-less charging device, in the method, coke<br>
is charged with a inclination angle sequentially varying from<br>
a furnace center side toward a furnace wall side, and, during<br>
the charge of the coke, also ore is simultaneously charged.<br>
Specifically, charge periods of ore and coke are as that shown<br>
in a conceptual diagram shown in Fig.2A. That is, coke is<br>
discharged from a furnace top bunker (for instance, la) where<br>
the coke is stored, and when a discharge amount of the coke<br>
from the furnace top bunker becomes 5 to 50% by mass of a coke<br>
charge amount for one batch stored in the furnace top bunker,<br>
from another furnace top bunker (for instance, 1b) where ore<br>
is stored the ore is begun discharging. Thereby, at the<br>
beginning, the center charge of coke, and, halfway on, the<br>
mix charge of coke and ore can be performed.<br>
In Fig.3, an example of a burden distribution formed<br>
when such charge is carried out in the furnace is shown. Here,<br>
reference signs C and 0 in Fig.3, respectively, denote coke<br>
and ore, and subscripts denote a batch number. Fig.3 shows<br>
a case where after firstly three rotations are carried out<br>
to charge coke, the mix charge of coke and ore is carried out.<br>
In this case, immediately after the coke charge, only the coke<br>
is charged on a furnace center side; accordingly, a deposit<br>
layer C2 made only of coke is formed in the furnace center part.<br>
Thereafter, ore is charged together with the coke;<br>
accordingly, a mixed layer C2 + O1 of the coke and ore is formed.<br>
In this case, the coke charged in advance piles up in heap<br>
in the furnace center part, and thereafter a mixture of the<br>
coke and ore is charged to a more furnace wall side than that;<br>
accordingly, the mixture later charged does not flow on the<br>
heap of the coke in the furnace center part. Thereby, in the<br>
furnace center part, a center coke layer where only coke piles<br>
up is formed. Furthermore, the ore later charged piles up<br>
outside (on furnace wall side) of the center coke layer<br>
simultaneously with the coke; accordingly, in a predetermined<br>
position in a radius direction in the furnace, a mixed layer<br>
C2 + O1 having a predetermined thickness is formed.<br>
In embodiment 1, the opening of the flow rate control<br>
gate 3 is preferably controlled so that the respective<br>
discharges of coke and ore may come to completion<br>
simultaneously. However, since the discharge times of the<br>
coke and ore from the furnace top bunker 1 vary depending on<br>
the respective particle diameters and moisture contents, the<br>
opening control of the flow rate control gate 3 may be<br>
appropriately carried out.<br>
In an example shown in Fig.3, coke and ore are<br>
respectively divided into two batches, a second batch of the<br>
coke and a first batch of the ore are partially simultaneously<br>
discharged, and thereby the center coke and the mixed layer<br>
are formed. However, in the invention, without restricting<br>
to the above, when the respective one charges of coke and ore<br>
are charged into the furnace without dividing into batches,<br>
a charging method in which a layer of coke alone is formed<br>
in the furnace center part and in the surroundings thereof<br>
a mixed layer is formed may be adopted. Furthermore, a<br>
charging method where coke is divided into two batches, one<br>
batch of coke alone C1 is charged over an entirety in the<br>
furnace, and thereafter from halfway of the second batch of<br>
the coke, ore for one charge is mixed and charged can be<br>
adopted.<br>
Furthermore, in Embodiment 1, a timing of starting<br>
discharging ore that is mixed with coke from the furnace top<br>
bunker is set at during a period from a time when the discharge<br>
of coke alone from another furnace top bunker is started to<br>
a time when coke corresponding to 5 to 50% by mass of an amount<br>
of coke that is charged in the batch is discharged. The reason<br>
for this is as follows.<br>
When an amount of discharge of coke alone is less than<br>
5% by mass, since an amount of coke that is piled up in the<br>
furnace center part is excessively slight, the mixture of coke<br>
and ore that is charged later is mingled with a coke layer<br>
in the furnace center part; accordingly, an effect of the coke<br>
center charge cannot be obtained. Furthermore, when after<br>
coke alone is charged exceeding 50% by mass, the mixture of<br>
coke and ore is started charging, since an amount of coke in<br>
the mixture cannot be sufficiently increased, an effect of<br>
the mix charge is difficult to obtain. Still furthermore,<br>
in this case, in a wide range in the furnace center part, a<br>
portion where ore is not present is generated, that is, the<br>
inside of the furnace cannot be effectively used, on the<br>
contrary, the productivity cannot be improved.<br>
Embodiment 2<br>
Fig.4 is a sectional view schematically showing a<br>
furnace top part of a blast furnace (hereinafter, referred<br>
to as bell-less blast furnace) provided with a bell-less<br>
charging device. In Fig.4, an angle that a blast furnace<br>
neutral axis and a rotation chute form (hereinafter referred<br>
to as inclination angle) is expressed with 9.<br>
A bell-less blast furnace is provided with two or more<br>
furnace top bunkers 1, and in one of the furnace top bunkers<br>
1 a mixed material 20 obtained by mixing coke and ore is stored.<br>
The mixed material 20 is discharged from a lower part of the<br>
furnace top bunker 1, controlled to a predetermined flow rate<br>
when passing through a flow rate control gate 3, and<br>
thereafter supplied through a vertical chute 4 to a charging<br>
chute 5.<br>
With the charging chute 5 rotating about a blast furnace<br>
neutral axis and a inclination angle 9 varying, the mixed<br>
material 20 is charged into the blast furnace 6. An arrow<br>
mark a in Fig.4 denotes the rotation of the charging chute<br>
5 and an arrow mark b denotes a fall of the mixed material<br>
20.<br>
When the mixed material 20 is thus charged into the blast<br>
furnace 6, by rotating the charging chute 5 and sequentially<br>
varying the inclination angle 9, over a wide range on a<br>
material pile surface 8 at a furnace top part of a blast<br>
furnace 7, the mixed material 20 can be charged.<br>
In Fig.4, a bell-less blast furnace provided with two<br>
furnace top bunkers 1 is shown; however, embodiment 2 can be<br>
applied also to a bell-less blast furnace provided with three<br>
or more furnace top bunkers 1.<br>
In the present invention 2, a method of storing the mixed<br>
material 20 of ore and coke in the furnace top bunker 1 is<br>
not restricted to a particular method. For instance, a so<br>
far known method in which from a weighing hopper of ore (not<br>
shown in the drawing) and a weighing hopper of coke (not shown<br>
in the drawing) , respectively, ore and coke are<br>
simultaneously discharged at a predetermined ratio and<br>
transferred through charge conveyers (not shown in the<br>
drawing) to the furnace top bunker 1 can be used.<br>
However, owing to the difference of the characteristics<br>
of ore and coke, the mixed material 20 in the furnace top<br>
bunker 1 cannot be avoided from locally varying in the mixing<br>
ratio. That is, while an average particle diameter of ore<br>
is such small as substantially 15 mm, an average particle<br>
diameter of coke is such large as substantially 50 mm;<br>
accordingly, when the mixed material 20 is thrown into the<br>
furnace top bunker 1, coke relatively large in the particle<br>
diameter rolls toward a wall side of the furnace top bunker<br>
1 and ore relatively small in the particle diameter tends to<br>
pile up at a position where it is thrown in.<br>
Furthermore, when the mixed material 20 is discharged<br>
from a lower part of the furnace top bunker 1, of the mixed<br>
material 20 stored in the furnace top bunker 1, the mixed<br>
material 20 distributed in a vertical direction from a lower<br>
layer part positioned immediately above a discharge outlet<br>
to a surface part is predominantly discharged, on a portion<br>
immediately above the discharge outlet where a pile level is<br>
lowered, the mixed material 20 flows in from the surroundings<br>
thereof (so-called funnel flow), and thereby the discharge<br>
proceeds.<br>
As a result, although, when the mixed material 20 is put<br>
in the furnace top bunker 1, ore and coke are previously mixed<br>
at a predetermined ratio, when the mixed material 20 is<br>
discharged from the furnace top bunker 1, the mixing ratio<br>
of the ore and coke varies. That is, at an initial stage of<br>
the discharge, the ratio of the ore increases and at the later<br>
stage of the discharge, the ratio of the coke increases. Thus,<br>
the mixing ratio cannot be avoided from varying when the mixed<br>
material 20 is thus discharged from the furnace top bunker<br>
1.<br>
Since the mixing ratio varies thus while the mixed<br>
material 20 is discharged from the furnace top bunker 1, when<br>
the mixed material 20 is charged through the charging chute<br>
5 into the blast furnace 6, the ore and coke in the mixed<br>
material 20 cannot be uniformly distributed on a material pile<br>
surface 6, resulting in causing segregation in a particular<br>
region.<br>
In this connection, in the present invention 2, in order<br>
to inhibit the segregation on the material pile surface 8 from<br>
occurring, during from the start of the charge of the mixed<br>
material 20 stored in one furnace top bunker 1 to the<br>
completion of the charge of the whole amount thereof, the<br>
charging chute 5 is rotated about the blast furnace neutral<br>
axis and the inclination angle 9 is sequentially varied, and<br>
thereby the charging chute 5 is reciprocated at least once<br>
in a radius direction in the furnace. When the inclination<br>
angle 9 is varied, at each of the inclination angles the<br>
charging chute 5 is rotated once.<br>
That is, at a predetermined inclination angle 9, the<br>
charging chute 5 is rotated once about the blast furnace<br>
neutral axis to charge the mixed material 20, thereafter the<br>
inclination angle 9 is varied and the mixed material 20 is<br>
charged. This is repeated until the charge of the whole amount<br>
of the mixed material 20 in the furnace top bunker 1 comes<br>
to completion, and, during this period, the charging chute<br>
5 is reciprocated at least once in a radius direction in the<br>
blast furnace. Accordingly, during the charge of the whole<br>
amount of the mixed material 20 stored in one furnace top<br>
bunker 1, on an arbitrary position on the material pile<br>
surface 8, the mixed material 20 is charged twice or more.<br>
In the operation of the bell-less blast furnace, usually,<br>
the inclination angle 9 of the charging chute 5 is set at<br>
several steps and each of the steps is assigned to a number<br>
(hereinafter referred to as notch number). Accordingly,<br>
after the charging chute 5 is rotated once at a predetermined<br>
notch number and the mixed material 20 is charged, the notch<br>
number is changed to the subsequent notch number followed by<br>
continuing the charge of the mixed material 20, and thereby<br>
the embodiment 2 can be applied to an existing bell-less blast<br>
furnace.<br>
Fig.5 is a sectional view schematically showing an<br>
example where the embodiment 2 is applied to charge a mixed<br>
material. In Fig.5, an example in which the charge of the<br>
mixed material 20 is begun from a furnace wall side, the mixed<br>
material 20 is continued charging with the inclination angle<br>
9 sequentially reducing, and, after the mixed material 20 is<br>
charged in the center part of the blast furnace, the mixed<br>
material 20 is charged with the inclination angle 9<br>
sequentially increasing is shown. Accordingly, in Fig.5, a<br>
mixed material 20a that was charged at the first rotation<br>
(hereinafter referred to as the first rotation) of the<br>
charging chute 5 that began charging the mixed material 20<br>
stored in the furnace top bunker 1 locates on a blast furnace<br>
wall side on a material pile surface 6, and a mixed material<br>
20b charged at the twelfth rotation (hereinafter referred to<br>
as the twelfth rotation) of the charging chute 5 locates on<br>
the mixed material 20a charged at the first rotation.<br>
Fig.5 shows a state when the charge of the whole amount<br>
of the mixed material 20 came to completion at the twelfth<br>
rotation. The charging chute 5 rotates once at a<br>
predetermined inclination angle 9 about the blast furnace<br>
neutral axis; accordingly, in Fig.5, the mixed material 20<br>
is charged on both sides of the blast furnace neutral axis.<br>
However, in Fig.5, only one side is shown.<br>
In Fig. 5, an example in which while the whole amount of<br>
the mixed material 20 stored in the furnace top bunker 1 is<br>
charged, the charging chute 5 is rotated twelve times is<br>
shown; however, in the embodiment 2, the number of rotation<br>
of the charging chute 5 is not restricted to a particular<br>
numerical value.<br>
Furthermore, in Fig.5, an example in which while the<br>
whole amount of the mixed material 20 stored in the furnace<br>
top bunker 1 is charged, the charging chute 5 reciprocates<br>
once in a radius direction in the blast furnace is shown; in<br>
the embodiment 2, the charging chute 5 need only reciprocate<br>
at least once in a radius direction of the blast furnace.<br>
Accordingly, while the whole amount of the mixed material 20<br>
stored in the furnace top bunker 1 is charged, the charging<br>
chute 5, after one reciprocation in a radius direction of the<br>
blast furnace, may rotate further several times, or may<br>
reciprocate tow or more times.<br>
That is, during the whole amount of the mixed material<br>
20 stored in the furnace top bunker 1 being charged, the number<br>
of times of rotations of the charging chute 5 about a blast<br>
furnace neutral axis and the number of times of reciprocations<br>
of the charging chute 5 in a radius direction of the blast<br>
furnace may be appropriately set. The flow rate of the mixed<br>
material 20 discharged from the furnace top bunker 1 is<br>
controlled with the flow rate control gate 3.<br>
In Fig. 5, an example where the charge of the mixed<br>
material 20 is started from a blast furnace wall side is shown.<br>
However, the charge of the mixed material 20 may be started<br>
from the blast furnace center side and continued with the<br>
inclination angle 6 sequentially increasing, and, after the<br>
mixed material 20 is charged on the blast furnace wall part,<br>
the mixed material 20 may be charged with the inclination<br>
angle 8 sequentially diminishing.<br>
When, during the whole amount of the mixed material 20<br>
stored in the furnace top bunker 1 being thus charged, the<br>
mixed material 20 is charged twice or more on an arbitrary<br>
position on the material pile surface 6, even when the mixing<br>
ratio of the mixed material 20 at the first charge varies (an<br>
increase in the ratio of, for instance, ore), in the charge<br>
at second time and after, the mixing ratio exhibits a reverse<br>
behavior (an increase in the ratio of, for instance, coke).<br>
Accordingly, the ore and coke can be distributed on the<br>
material pile surface 8 with a definite mixing ratio. As a<br>
result, the gas permeability of a cohesive zone can be<br>
improved, a temperature fluctuation of the hot pig iron can<br>
be inhibited from occurring, and thereby the hot pig iron<br>
having uniform quality can be obtained.<br>
In actuality, when the charge at a predetermined notch<br>
number is carried out once, the mixed material 20 piles up<br>
on the material pile surface 8 spreading in a radius<br>
direction; accordingly, when the charging chute 5 is<br>
reciprocated in a radius direction, there is no need of<br>
reciprocating at the same notch number. At a predetermined<br>
width in a radius direction, the charging chute 5 need only<br>
reciprocate at least once.<br>
Embodiment 3<br>
As shown in Fig.6, in a bell-less blast furnace 6 that<br>
has a charging chute 5, material such as ore and coke is<br>
charged from a furnace top through a charging chute 5, and<br>
thereby a burden distribution in the furnace 14 is formed.<br>
The charging chute 5 is controlled so as to be 9 in the<br>
inclination angle with respect to the furnace neutral axis<br>
in a furnace center part 6a and charges the material while<br>
rotating about the furnace neutral axis. Thereby, a material<br>
deposit surface having the point symmetry with the furnace<br>
center part 6a as a center is formed. Furthermore, the<br>
material being charged, when an angle of the charging chute<br>
is varied, can be put on an arbitrary position on a furnace<br>
top surface.<br>
A charge position in a radius direction in the furnace<br>
can be controlled by controlling the inclination angle 9 of<br>
the charging chute 5. Usually, in advance, corresponding<br>
notch numbers are assigned to predetermined inclination<br>
angles. When the material is charged while rotating about<br>
the furnace neutral axis, the notch number is previously<br>
determined for each rotation of the charging chute from the<br>
charge start of the material. When a pattern of the notch<br>
numbers is controlled, the charge control by which a pattern<br>
of the material charge into the furnace can be controlled is<br>
performed.<br>
Falling positions of the material corresponding to the<br>
inclination angles of the charging chute are previously<br>
investigated when prior to the start of operation of a blast<br>
furnace material filling in the furnace is investigated.<br>
Alternatively, by mechanically calculating a dropping<br>
trajectory of the material by taking the centrifugal force<br>
and the gravity when the material flows down above the<br>
rotating charging chute, and an ascending flow of gas in the<br>
furnace into consideration, a charging position of the<br>
material can be obtained.<br>
When the charge of the center coke is considered, when<br>
the coke is charged by diminishing the inclination angle for<br>
each rotation from the beginning of charge, as shown in Fig. 7 ,<br>
a charge position of coke at the second rotation comes more<br>
toward the furnace center part than that of the first rotation.<br>
When the center coke is charged like this, the coke at the<br>
second rotation, after falling on the furnace center side more<br>
than the coke at the first rotation, flows into the furnace<br>
center side. At this time, among the coke at the second<br>
rotation, relatively coarser particles flow toward the<br>
furnace center side.<br>
That is, when, as the rotation proceeds, the falling<br>
position of the coke is moved toward the furnace center side,<br>
the fallen coke flows from the falling position along an<br>
inclined plane toward the furnace center side; accordingly,<br>
the coarsest particles of the charged coke pile up at the<br>
furnace center part.<br>
At this time, when the falling positions at the first<br>
and second rotations are the same, the coke at the second<br>
rotation flows divided in the furnace center side and the<br>
furnace wall side; accordingly, coarse particles of coke<br>
partially at the second rotation flow toward the furnace wall<br>
side and cause a problem. However, as in the embodiment 3,<br>
when, as the rotation proceeds, the falling position of the<br>
coke is moved toward the furnace center side, all of the coarse<br>
particles flow into the furnace center side. It is effective<br>
in view of the intensification of the segregation of the<br>
coarse coke at the furnace center part.<br>
Furthermore, in the Embodiment 3, the charge start<br>
position of the center coke is preferably set at a radius<br>
position corresponding to 0.1 to 0.4 relative to a<br>
dimensionless radius with the furnace center part of the blast<br>
furnace assigned to 0 and the furnace wall part assigned to<br>
1. When the charge start position is larger than 0.4, since<br>
when the charge of the center coke is begun, an amount of coke<br>
charged by one rotation becomes slight, the coke does not flow<br>
in the neighborhood of the furnace center part, resulting in<br>
less effective in the effect of charging coarser particles<br>
in the furnace center part. Still furthermore, when the<br>
charge start position is less than 0.1, since a distance<br>
through which the charged coke flows in becomes short, the<br>
effect of causing the particle segregation becomes less.<br>
In order to examine a preferable range of the charge<br>
start position of the center coke, one-fifth scale model<br>
experiment of a furnace top charging device of a blast furnace<br>
having a furnace capacity of 5000 m3 was conducted and<br>
relationship between the ratio of coarse coke in a radius<br>
direction and the charge start position of the center coke<br>
was investigated. Results are shown in Fig.9. Here, the<br>
coarse coke particle ratio is defined as follows. That is,<br>
after the charge experiment was over, at each of the<br>
respective dimensionless radius positions, a predetermined<br>
amount was sampled and a particle size distribution of the<br>
coke was measured, and, with particles having particle<br>
diameter larger than a median diameter of the charged coke<br>
as coarse particles, a ratio of the coarse particles in each<br>
of the samples is obtained as the coarse coke particle ratio.<br>
In each of the experiments, the coke was charged by 5<br>
rotations. Here, in the case of the charge start positions<br>
being 0.05 and 0.1, after one rotation, the charge position<br>
was moved toward the furnace center side by 0.01 in terms of<br>
dimensionless radius to charge. Furthermore, in the case of<br>
the charge start position being 0.4 and 0.45, after one<br>
rotation, the charge position was moved toward the furnace<br>
center side by 0.05 in terms of the dimensionless radius to<br>
charge.<br>
In the case of the charge start position being 0.05 in<br>
terms of dimensionless radius, since the coke after the second<br>
rotation overflowed on the contrary from the furnace center<br>
part toward the furnace wall part and piled up, in essence,<br>
there is no large difference from the case of direct charge<br>
to the furnace center part. Also in the particle size<br>
measurement, the coarse particle ratio results in increasing<br>
toward the furnace wall side rather than toward the furnace<br>
center side.<br>
Furthermore, in the case of the charge start position<br>
being 0.45 in terms of the dimensionless radius, in the range<br>
of 0 to 0.3 in terms of the dimensionless radius, the coarse<br>
coke particle ratio does not so much vary, resulting in there<br>
being no large segregation. On the other hand, in the case<br>
of the charge start position being in the range of 0.1 to 0.4,<br>
in the range of 0 to 0.2 in terms of the dimensionless radius,<br>
70% or more of the coke becomes coarse particles; that is,<br>
it is found that the segregation of the coarse particles in<br>
the neighborhood of the center part is intensified.<br>
Subsequently, embodiments 4 and 5 will be explained.<br>
The present inventors found that when material is charged in<br>
a blast furnace by use of a bell-less charging device, as shown<br>
in Fig.1, material discharged from a furnace top bunker 1,<br>
when a charging chute 5 is rotated about a furnace neutral<br>
axis and an angle (6) between the charging chute and the<br>
furnace neutral axis is altered for each rotation, can be<br>
charged uniformly in a furnace periphery direction and at an<br>
arbitrary position in a radius direction in the furnace. That<br>
is, when the charge of coke is started from a state where a<br>
inclination angle (9) is almost zero, that is, the charging<br>
chute is almost vertical and 9 is increased stepwise for each<br>
rotation, coke being piled up in the furnace can be piled up<br>
in the furnace center part at the charge start time and, with<br>
time, toward the furnace wall side. When this charge method<br>
is applied, when, of the coke for one batch that is discharged<br>
from the furnace top bunker into the furnace, the coke large<br>
in the particle diameter can be selectively discharged at the<br>
start of the discharge, the coke large in the particle<br>
diameter can be selectively charged in the center part in the<br>
blast furnace.<br>
In order to make the particle diameter of the coke that<br>
is charged at the beginning of one batch larger than that of<br>
the coke that is subsequently charged, it need only do as<br>
follows.<br>
Usually, to each of lower parts of a plurality of coke<br>
bins where blast furnace coke is stored, a screen 21 is<br>
disposed, and a screen mesh thereof is set at 35 mm. Here,<br>
the screen mesh of part of the coke bins is set at for instance<br>
55 mm that is larger than that of the other coke bins. When<br>
thus disposed, as shown in Fig. 10, when coke is transferred<br>
from these coke bins 22 to the weighing hopper 23, when,<br>
firstly, only a definite amount of coke 24a from the coke bin<br>
22a that has the larger screen mesh is transferred to the<br>
weighing hopper 23, and subsequently, coke 24b from the other<br>
coke bin is transferred, in the weighing hopper 23, on a lower<br>
side, the coke 24a having a particle diameter of 55 mm or more,<br>
thereon the coke 24b having a particle diameter of 35 mm or<br>
more, in total for one batch of coke, can be piled.<br>
Subsequently, after weighing the coke for this one batch, the<br>
coke is discharged from a lower part of the hopper 3 and<br>
transferred to a bunker 1 at the furnace top. Even at this<br>
time, in the bunker 1, similarly to the above, on a lower side,<br>
the coke 24a having a particle diameter of 55 mm or more.<br>
thereon the coke 24b having a particle diameter of 35 ram or<br>
more, in total for one batch of coke, are piled. Here, as<br>
shown in Fig.1, when these cokes are charged from a furnace<br>
center part toward a furnace wall part, while reversely<br>
tilting, from the bunker 1 through the chute 5, the particle<br>
diameter of the coke piled up in the blast furnace becomes<br>
larger in average in the center part than in the periphery<br>
part.<br>
In the Embodiments 4 and 5, an amount of the coke 24a<br>
that has a particle diameter of 55 mm or more is empirically<br>
inferred from a pile height in the weighing hopper 23.<br>
Furthermore, an amount thereof in one batch is preferably in<br>
the range of 5 to 50% by mass. When it is less than 5% by<br>
mass, since an amount of the coke that has a larger particle<br>
diameter is less in the furnace center part, it is<br>
insufficient for coke having an ordinary particle diameter<br>
to flow in the furnace center part to form a strong center<br>
flow. On the other hand, when it is more than 50% by mass,<br>
although it is sufficient to form a strong center flow, an<br>
amount of coke of minus screen that cannot be used increases,<br>
resulting in causing inconvenience.<br>
The present invention exhibits effects in each of the<br>
above-explained embodiments 1 through 5. However, when these<br>
are combined, the distribution of the charge in the blast<br>
furnace can be more effectively optimized. For instance, in<br>
Fig. 3, the embodiment 4 can be applied to the C1 layer; the<br>
embodiment 3 to the C2 layer; the embodiment 1 to the C2 + O1<br>
layer; and the embodiment 2 to the O2 layer.<br>
Examples<br>
(Example 1}<br>
With a blast furnace that has a furnace capacity of 5000<br>
m3 and is equipped with a bell-less charging device,<br>
experimental operations were carried out to improve the<br>
productivity thereof. In the blast furnace, the inclination<br>
angles of the charging chute, as shown in Table 3, correspond<br>
to the notch numbers. The larger the notch number is, the<br>
smaller is set the inclination angle. Accordingly,<br>
immediately after the start of the charge, the charging chute<br>
is at 20th notch and in an almost vertical state, thereafter,<br>
with the inclination angle gradually increasing, the charge<br>
is carried out.<br>
Furthermore, in the experimental operations, by setting<br>
the productivity, a target in such blast furnace, of molten<br>
iron at three levels of 1.8, 2.0 and 2.1 (cases 1 through 3) ,<br>
an amount of production was sequentially increased. In the<br>
operations of the productivity of 1.8 and 2.0, a conventional<br>
charging method of material was adopted; and in the operation<br>
of the productivity of 2.1, a charging method according to<br>
the invention of material was adopted. Here, the productivity<br>
of molten iron denotes a numerical value obtained by dividing<br>
a tapping amount a day of the blast furnace (t/d) with a<br>
furnace capacity (m3). The larger productivity means an<br>
operation that intends a larger amount of production. Charge<br>
conditions of coke and ore in the experimental operations<br>
(kind of batch, charge amount of batch, the notch numbers of<br>
the charging chute and furnace top bunker used) are<br>
collectively shown in Table 1.<br>
Firstly, in case 1, an operation with the productivity<br>
of 1.8, only coke was charged as C1, thereafter coke for center<br>
charge was charged as C2, and further thereafter coke of C3<br>
and ore of O1 that were previously mixed and stored in a mixed<br>
state in. a furnace top bunker were simultaneously charged to<br>
form a mixed layer. Thereafter, only ore was charged as O2<br>
on a furnace wall side and thereby a layer made of ore alone<br>
was formed. As the ore of O2, one having smaller particle<br>
diameter of the ores was charged particularly on the furnace<br>
wall side. With the sequence of operations as one charge,<br>
the charges were repeated. This operation is a conventional<br>
technology and corresponds to one in which the center charge<br>
of coke and the mix charge are separately carried out.<br>
In order to increase the amount of production of the hot<br>
pig iron in the case 1, with an intension of increasing the<br>
productivity up to 2.0, an operation in which a blast volume<br>
to the blast furnace is increased to increase a reduced amount<br>
of ore per unit time was carried out. However, in the<br>
operation, since it took a long time to divide coke and ore<br>
for one charge into 5 batches each and to transport to the<br>
furnace top bunkers, material supply for keeping a pile<br>
surface in the furnace at a substantially constant level<br>
became difficult, resulting in necessity of shortening the<br>
transporting time.<br>
As a result, the formation of the mixed layer due to the<br>
simultaneous charge of the coke and ore that are mixed in<br>
advance was abandoned; as case 2, an operation in which 4<br>
batches are transported for one charge was adopted.<br>
Furthermore, at this time, as a countermeasure for improving<br>
the productivity, it was necessary to raise an agglomerated<br>
ore ratio (a ratio of sintered ore in ore) to 82% by mass to<br>
improve the reduction in the furnace.<br>
An operation situation of case 2 is shown in Table 2.<br>
Although, in order to improve the productivity, the mix charge<br>
of case 1 was given up and the agglomerated ore ratio was<br>
raised, the permeability resistance index in the furnace rose<br>
from 1.05 to 1.17, that is, the gas permeability was more<br>
deteriorated than the case 1.<br>
There, by applying the material charging method<br>
according to the invention, coke was charged as C2 from the<br>
furnace center part to a furnace middle part during 13<br>
rotations of the charging chute and from 6th rotations of 13<br>
rotations and on ore was simultaneously charged. This means<br>
that at a time point when substantially 40% by mass of a total<br>
amount of charged coke of C2 is charged, the mix charge of the<br>
coke and ore was begun. Operation results of the case 3 are<br>
shown in the Table 2 together with the case 1 and case 2.<br>
In Table 2, the coke ratio and pulverized coal ratio,<br>
respectively, denote amounts (kg) of coke and pulverized coal<br>
used to produce 1 ton of molten iron. The agglomerated ore<br>
ratio is a numeral value that shows a mass ratio of sintered<br>
ore in ore and so on that are charged from the furnace top<br>
in terms of percentage. The coke strength TI is a tumbler<br>
index. The permeability resistance index can be expressed<br>
with the following equation.<br>
[{(BP/98.0665 + 1.033) X 10000}2 - {(TP/98.0665 + 1.033) X<br>
10000}2]/(1.033 X 10000 X LSLOT)/(BGV/SAVE)1.7 X 273/{(SGT +<br>
273)/2 + 273}<br>
In the above equation,<br>
BP: blast pressure [kPa]<br>
TP: furnace top pressure [kPa]<br>
LSLOT: distance between stockline and tuyere [m]<br>
BGV: bosh gas volume [Nm3/min]<br>
SAVE: average sectional area in blast furnace [m2]<br>
SGT: gas temperature typical in shaft part: 1000 degree<br>
centigrade.<br>
From Table 2, it is obvious that according to the<br>
invention, the productivity could be raised to 2.1. In this<br>
case, without interrupting the mix charge halfway, the coke<br>
center charge and the mix charge could be simultaneously<br>
carried out, and the permeability resistance index was also<br>
reduced to the level the same as case 1.<br>
(Example 2)<br>
In an operation where an ore layer and a coke layer are<br>
alternately formed in a bell-less blast furnace (furnace<br>
capacity of 5000 m3) , in forming an ore layer, as shown in Fig. 5,<br>
a mixed material 20 in which coke is mixed in ore in advance<br>
was stored in one of furnace top bunkers 1. An amount of coke<br>
in the mixed material 20 was set at 16% by mass with respect<br>
to an amount of total coke for one cycle of the ore layer and<br>
coke layer.<br>
In charging the mixed material 20 through a charging<br>
chute 5, in order that the whole amount of the mixed material<br>
20 in the furnace top bunker 1 may be charged during twelve<br>
rotations of the charging chute 5, a flow rate of the mixed<br>
material 20 that is discharged from the furnace top bunker<br>
1 was adjusted with a flow rate control gate 3. That is, as<br>
shown in Fig. 5, the charge was begun from a blast furnace wall<br>
side (that is, the mixed material 20a charged at the first<br>
rotation) , the mixed material 2 was charged with a inclination<br>
angle 9 sequentially diminishing, after the mixed material 20<br>
was charged up to a predetermined inclination angle in a blast<br>
furnace center direction, with the inclination angle 9<br>
sequentially increasing the mixed material 20 was charged.<br>
Thus, the charge was begun from the blast furnace wall side,<br>
the charging chute 5 reciprocated once in the radius direction<br>
in the blast furnace followed by charging again on the blast<br>
furnace wall side (that is, the mixed material 20b charged<br>
at the twelfth rotation) , and thereby the charge of the whole<br>
amount of the mixed material 20 in the furnace top bunker 1<br>
came to completion. This is an inventive example.<br>
On the other hand, as a comparative example, in charging<br>
the mixed material 20 similarly to the inventive example, a<br>
flow rate control gate 3 was controlled so that the whole<br>
amount of the mixed material 20 in the furnace top bunker 1<br>
may be charged during twelve rotations of the charging chute<br>
5. The charge was begun from a blast furnace wall side, the<br>
mixed material 20 was charged with a inclination angle 9<br>
sequentially diminishing, and the charge of the whole amount<br>
of the mixed material 20 in the furnace top bunker 1 came to<br>
completion on the furnace center side.<br>
The bell-less blast furnace used here is operated with<br>
the inclination angle 9 of the charging chute 5 set with the<br>
notch number. The correspondence between the notch numbers<br>
and the inclination angles 8's is the same as that shown in<br>
Table 3.<br>
Furthermore, the setting of the notch numbers when the<br>
mixed material 20 was charged is shown in Table 5. The setting<br>
of the notch numbers in Table 5 denotes that the charging chute<br>
5 made one rotation at each of the notch numbers. For instance,<br>
in the comparative example, the notch number [5] is written<br>
consecutively twice. This means that after the charging chute<br>
5 was rotated twice at the notch number [5] , the charging chute<br>
5 was rotated at the subsequent notch number [6].<br>
When the coke layer is formed, in both the inventive<br>
example and the comparative example, an amount corresponding<br>
to 10% by mass relative to the whole amount of coke for one<br>
cycle was charged to the blast furnace center part (so-called<br>
center coke) , and remaining coke is evenly charged in a radius<br>
direction in the blast furnace. That is, the charge sequence<br>
was three-batch charge of coke-coke-ore (mixed material 20) .<br>
The inventive example and the comparative example,<br>
respectively, were operated for 5 days, and the coke ratio,<br>
pulverized coal ratio, blast temperature, hot metal<br>
temperature, and tap Si concentration were measured. Results<br>
thereof are shown together in Table 2. The coke ratio and<br>
the pulverized coal ratio in Table 4 , respectively, are ratios<br>
of a total amount of used coke and a total amount of used<br>
pulverized coal to a total tapping amount of molten iron for<br>
5 days. Furthermore, the blast temperature, hot metal<br>
temperature and Si concentration in the molten iron are<br>
average values of measurements obtained by periodically<br>
measuring (6 to 7 times a day) . For the hot metal temperature<br>
and Si concentration in the molten iron, the dispersions of<br>
the measurements are also shown.<br>
As obvious from Table 4, according to the inventive<br>
example, the dispersions of the hot metal temperatures and<br>
Si concentrations in the molten iron were reduced in<br>
comparison with that of the comparative examples.<br>
Accordingly, in the inventive example, even when the blast<br>
temperature was lowered by 30 degree centigrade in comparison<br>
with the comparative example, the stable operation was<br>
performed with the equivalent hot metal temperature<br>
maintained.<br>
(Example 3)<br>
In a large blast furnace having a furnace capacity of<br>
5000 m3, an operation was carried out under the operation<br>
conditions shown in Table 5. Here, in the comparative example,<br>
in charging the center coke, the charging chute was set at<br>
the inclination angle of 0° and thereby concentrated charge<br>
to the furnace center was performed. On the other hand, in<br>
the inventive example, the charge start position was set at<br>
0.3 in terms of the dimensionless radius, and the charge<br>
position was moved toward the furnace center side by 0.03 in<br>
terms of the dimensionless radius for each rotation to charge<br>
the center coke.<br>
During the respective operations, with a sonde disposed<br>
at a level 5 m below from a furnace top pile surface of a blast<br>
furnace shaft part feeding in a radius direction in the<br>
furnace, a gas in the furnace at each of the respective<br>
positions from the furnace wall to the furnace center part<br>
was sampled. These sampled gases were analyzed of CO gas and<br>
CO2 gas. From their volume percents, the gas utilization<br>
efficiency was calculated.<br>
The gas utilization efficiency is a value calculated<br>
from the following equation.<br>
Gas utilization efficiency (%) = {CO2 (volume %)}/{C0<br>
(volume %) + CO2 (volume %) } x 100<br>
In the blast furnace, it is considered that at a portion<br>
where the gas utilization efficiency is large, a ratio of ore<br>
becomes relatively high.<br>
Calculation results of the gas utilization efficiency<br>
are shown in Fig.8.<br>
As shown in Fig. 8, in the comparative example, the gas<br>
utilization efficiency at the furnace center part is higher<br>
than that in the periphery thereof (up to a position of<br>
substantially 0.2 in terms of dimensionless radius). This<br>
is considered that as a result of the center coke being charged<br>
concentrated at the furnace center part, coarser particles<br>
in the coke flowed in the periphery part of the furnace center,<br>
thereby the gas flow in the furnace in this part was<br>
intensified and ore charged in this part was blown up, and<br>
thereby an ore layer was collapsed and flowed in the furnace<br>
center part.<br>
As a result thereof, in the operation of comparative<br>
example, the gas flow in the furnace center part became<br>
unstable, resulting in the fuel ratio of substantially 507<br>
kg/t (molten iron).<br>
On the other hand, in the inventive example, it is found<br>
that since the gas utilization efficiency at the furnace<br>
center part is such low as substantially 15%, a strong gas<br>
flow is formed in the furnace center part. Owing to the charge<br>
in the furnace being stably distributed, even when the fuel<br>
ratio is lowered to substantially 498 kg/t (molten iron) , the<br>
production the same as that of comparative example or more<br>
can be achieved.<br>
Furthermore, as obvious also from Table 5, in the<br>
inventive example, since pulverized coal less expensive in<br>
the cost in comparison with comparative example could be used<br>
much, and furthermore the total fuel ratio also could be<br>
reduced.<br>
(Example 4)<br>
With a test blast furnace that has a furnace capacity<br>
of substantially 10 m3 and is provided with a bell-less<br>
charging device, a charge test of material was conducted. As<br>
materials being charged, sintered ore was used as iron ore<br>
(sign 0) and blast furnace coke that is usually used was used<br>
as coke (sign C) . At this time, a mass ratio of ore to coke<br>
(0/C) was 3.2, 1 charge of ore was charged by one batch, and<br>
1 charge of coke was charged by one batch. The charge of coke<br>
was carried out in two ways; that is, one is due to a material<br>
charging method involving the aforementioned present<br>
invention and the other one is due to a conventional material<br>
charging method (all screen mesh of coke bins was set at 35<br>
mm) .<br>
The coke falling from the chute when the coke was charged<br>
was captured with a sampler at a definite time interval<br>
followed by measuring a particle diameter of the obtained<br>
sample. In Fig. 11, a horizontal axis shows an amount of coke<br>
discharged from a bunker in terms of % (a total amount is<br>
assigned to 100 %) and a vertical axis shows a ratio (%) of<br>
55 or more in a sampled coke. From Fig. 11, it is obvious that<br>
according to the present invention, a particle diameter of<br>
coke that piles up in the early stage of the charge, that is,<br>
in the furnace center part becomes larger in comparison with<br>
that of the conventional charging method.<br><br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
According to the embodiment 1, in carrying out an<br>
operation of high production amount with a bell-less blast<br>
furnace, the mix charge of coke and ore and the center charge<br>
of coke can be simultaneously carried out. Thereby, an<br>
increase in the pressure loss in the furnace that is likely<br>
to occur when the operation of high production amount is<br>
carried out can be effectively inhibited from occurring, and<br>
thereby without increasing an amount used of high quality<br>
materials such as sintered ore and reduced iron, the molten<br>
iron can be increased in amount of production.<br>
According to the embodiment 2, even when properties and<br>
states such as the particle size distribution, moisture<br>
content and so on of various kinds of materials used in the<br>
blast furnace vary, on the material pile surface at the blast<br>
furnace top the ore and coke can be distributed with a constant<br>
mixing ratio, and thereby the hot metal temperature and the<br>
quality of molten iron can be inhibited from fluctuating.<br>
According to the application of the embodiment 3, in the<br>
center charge of coke in the bell-less blast furnace with a<br>
charging chute, a particle diameter of coke could be made the<br>
largest at the furnace center part, and thereby a stable<br>
operation could be realized. Furthermore, at lower fuel<br>
ratios the production the same as ever or more could be<br>
achieved, that is, more favorable blast furnace operation<br>
could be realized.<br>
According to the embodiments 4 and 5, even when an<br>
existing bell-less charging device is used without separately<br>
disposing a charging device exclusive for coke, without<br>
increasing the number of batches of materials, coke larger<br>
in the particle diameter than that charged in the periphery<br>
part can be selectively charged to the furnace center part.<br>
This suggests that when the invention is adopted in an actual<br>
blast furnace, a center flow of gas in the furnace can be<br>
stably secured, and thereby highly productive and economical<br>
smelting of the molten iron can be realized.<br>
