The present invention relates to methods for producing 2',3'-dideoxyinosine<br>
useful as an antiviral agent, represented by the following formula (7), (which is<br>
called didanosine (DDI) and herein after referred to as "DDI"), intermediate<br>
compounds that are essential in producing the DDI, and methods for producing<br>
the intermediate compounds.<br><br>
DDI is useful as an antiviral agent and has already been approved as an<br>
anti-AIDS drug in many countries including the U.S.A., Japan and European<br>
countries.<br>
To obtain a dideoxy (DD) derivative from nucleoside, there is<br>
conventionally known, for example, a method where hydroxyl groups at the 2'-<br>
and 3'-positions of nucleoside and subjected to thiocarbonylation, followed by<br>
radical reduction to form a didehydrodideoxy (D4) derivative, and the D4<br>
derivative is subjected to hydrogenation or the like, thereby obtaining a dideoxy<br>
(DD) derivative. Some sunthesis methods for various antiviral agents based on<br>
the above mentioned   technique   are   reported,   which   include   a  method<br><br>
described in: Chu, C. K. et. al. J. Org. Chem. 1989, 54, 2217-2225. However, the<br>
method described in the aforementioned literature needs a step of protecting a<br>
hydroxyl group at the 5'-position of nucleoside in advance. For example, when<br>
adenosine is used as a raw material for the production of the DD derivative,<br>
tert-butyldimethylsilyl group (e.g., refer to Chu, C. K. et. al. J. Org. Chem. 1989,<br>
54, 2217-2225) and trityl group (e.g., refer to Yurkevich, A. M, et al. Tetrahedron,<br>
1969, 25, 477-484) are adopted as the protective groups. However, when the DDI<br>
is produced using inosine as a raw material, the aforementioned protective<br>
groups    cause    the    problems    shown    below.	Namely,     as    for    the<br>
tert-butyldimethylsilyl group, it is expensive and a fluorine-based reagent<br>
becomes necessary in the process of deprotection. The use of trityl group<br>
prevents the progress of the reaction with satisfactory yields (e.g., refer to<br>
Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication (JP Kokai) Hei 07-109290). In light<br>
of the above, there is an increasing demand for development of methods for<br>
producing DDI (7) and 2',3,-didehydro-2,,3'- dideoxyinosine (4) (which is called D4<br>
inosine and hereinafter referred to as "D4I") inexpensively so as to obtain<br><br>
There is known a compound where amino group and hydroxyl group<br>
respectively at the 1-position and the 5'-position of inosine are protected by benzyl<br>
(e.g., Luzzio, F A. et al. J. Org. Chem., 1994, 59, 7267-7272). However, nothing<br>
has   been   known    about   a   production   method   for   the   DDI   from   the<br><br>
above-mentioned compound as a raw material by subjecting two hydroxyl groups<br>
at the 2'- and 3'-positions to deoxylation.<br>

(i) In the present invention, the inosine derivative of general formula (3) is<br>
first subjected to dithiocarbonylation to obtain the thiocarbonylated inosine<br>
derivative represented by general formula (5). To achieve the step of<br>
dithiocarbonylation, the processes for thiocarbonylation, such as alkylthio-<br>
thiocarbonylation, alkoxy-thiocarbonylation, aliylarnino-thiocarbonylation and<br>
the like can be employed.<br>
The process of atkylthio-thiocarbonylation can be carried out by allowing the<br>
inosine derivative of general formula (3) to react with carbon disulfide and an<br>
alkyl halide in the presence of a base in an appropriate solvent. Examples of the<br>
solvent include dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSQ), dimethylformamide (DMF),<br>
N-methylpyrrolidone, tetrahydrofuran and the like. In particular, DMSO is<br>
preferable. The amount of solvent may be preferably in the range of 0.5 to 5 L,<br>
more preferably 1 to 2 L, with respect to 1 mol of the inosine derivative of general<br>
formula (3). It is preferable that the amount of carbon disulfide be 2 to 4<br>
equivalent weights, more preferably 2 to 2.5 equivalent weights, with respect to<br>
the inosine derivative of general formula (3). The base includes sodium<br>
hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium<br>
hydride and the like, and sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide are<br>
preferably used. The amount of base may be preferably 2 to 4 equivalent<br>
weights, more preferably 2 to 2.5 equivalent weights, with respect to the inosine<br>
derivative of general formula (3). Examples of the alkyl halide to be used<br>
include methyl iodide, ethyl iodide, 2-cyanoethyl bromide and the like.    In<br><br>
particular, methyl iodide and 2-cyanoethyl bromide are preferable. The amount<br>
of alkyl halide is preferably 2 to 5 equivalent weights, more preferably 2 to 3<br>
equivalent weights, with respect to the inosine derivative of general formula (3).<br>
The reaction temperature, which varies depending upon the kind of solvent, is<br>
generally in the range of -20 to 50Â°C, preferably 0 to 30Â°C. It is preferable to<br>
carry out the reaction within the above-mentioned temperature range from the<br>
viewpoint of yield. The reaction time is generally in the range of 0.1 to 10 hours,<br>
preferably 1 to 3 hours. To cause the reaction within the above-mentioned time<br>
range produces good results in terms of yield.<br>
The process of alkoxy-thiocarbonylation can be carried out, for example, as<br>
described in WO017309aVJ?y allowing the inosine derivative of general formula<br>
(3) to react with an alkoxy-thiocarbonyl halide in the presence of a base in an<br>
appropriate solvent. Examples of the solvent include organic solvents such as<br>
acetonitrile, dimethylformamide (DMF\ pyridine, ethyl acetate, toluene and the<br>
like. Acetonitrile is preferable. The amount of solvent may be preferably in the<br>
range of 0.5 to 5 L, more preferably 1 to 2 L, with respect to 1 mol of the inosine<br>
derivative of general formula (3). The base includes organic tertiary amines<br>
such as pyridine, triethylamine, N-ethylpiperidine, N-ethylrnorpholine and the<br>
like, and triethylamine and pyridine are preferably used. The amount of base is<br>
preferably 2 to 4 equivalent weights, more preferably 2 to 2.5 equivalent weights,<br>
with respect to the inosine derivative of general formula (3). The reaction<br>
temperature, which varies depending upon the kind of solvent, is generally in the<br>
range of -50 to 50Â°C, preferably -20 to 20Â°C. It is preferable to carry out the<br>
reaction within the above-mentioned temperature range from the viewpoint of<br>
yield. The reaction time is generally in the range of 0.1 to 5 hours, preferably 0.5<br>
to 2 hours. To cause the reaction within the above-mentioned time range<br>
produces good results in terms of yield.<br>
The process of alkylamino-thiocarbonylation can be carried out by a method<br>
as described in, for example, Nishiyama, K. et al. Tetrahedron Lett., 2003, 44,<br><br>
4027-4029, Izawa, K. et al. Tetrahedron Lett, 2001, 42, 7605-7608, or the like.<br>
More specifically, the inosine derivative of general formula (3) may be allowed to<br>
react with phenyl isothiocyanate or l,l'-thiocarbonyl diimidazole in an<br>
appropriate solvent, in the presence of a base when necessary. Examples of the<br>
solvent include organic solvents such as dimethylformamide (DMF),<br>
tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile and the like. In particular, dimethylformamide<br>
and tetrahydrofuran are preferable. The amount of solvent may be preferably in<br>
the range of 0.5 to 5 L, more preferably 1 to 2 L, with respect to 1 mol of the<br>
inosine derivative of general formula (3). The base includes sodium hydride,<br>
sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and the like, and sodium hydride is<br>
preferably used. The amount of base is preferably 2 to 4 equivalent weights,<br>
more preferably 2 to 2.5 equivalent weights, with respect to the inosine derivative<br>
of general formula (3). The reaction may proceed in the absence of a base, and<br>
therefore the base is not always necessary. The reaction temperature, which<br>
varies depending upon the kind of solvent, is generally in the range of -20 to<br>
100Â°C, preferably 0 to 80CC. It is preferable to carry out the reaction within the<br>
above-mentioned temperature range from the viewpoint of yield. The reaction<br>
time is generally in the range of 0.1 to 5 hours, preferably 0.5 to 2 hours. To<br>
cause the reaction within the above-mentioned time range produces good results<br>
in terms of yield.<br>
(ii) According to the present invention, the compound of general formula (l)<br>
can be obtained by subjecting the compound represented by general formula (5) to<br>
radical reduction.<br>
Examples of the solvent that can be used in this step include<br>

temperature. It is preferable to carry out the reaction within the<br>
above-mentioned temperature range from the viewpoint of yield. In this step,<br>
