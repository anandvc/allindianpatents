DESCRIPTION<br>
POWER DETERMINING METHOD, SINGLE-SIDED MULTILAYER<br>
OPTICAL DISK, RECORDING METHOD, COMPUTER PROGRAM PRODUCT,<br>
COMPUTER-READABLE MEDIUM, AND OPTICAL DISK APPARATUS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a power<br>
determining method for determining the light emitting power of<br>
a laser beam for recording information on an optical disk<br>
having plural rewritable recording layers, a single-sided<br>
multilayer optical disk to which the power determining method<br>
may be applied, a recording method and an optical disk<br>
apparatus for recording information on an optical disk using<br>
the light emitting power determined by the power determining<br>
method, a power determining program used in the optical disk<br>
apparatus, a computer-readable medium that stores such a<br>
program, and a computer program product including such a<br>
computer-readable medium.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In recent years and continuing, with the<br>
development of digital technology and data compression<br>
technology, optical disks such as the CD (compact disk) and<br>
the DVD (digital versatile disk) are commonly being applied as<br>
 <br>
-2-<br>
media for recording information such as music, photographs,<br>
and computer software, for example (referred to as 'contents').<br>
Also, with the decrease in price of such optical disks,<br>
optical disk apparatuses configured to record information on<br>
such optical disks are becoming increasingly popular.<br>
An optical disk apparatus may be configured to<br>
record/erase information on/from an optical disk having a<br>
spiral track or concentric tracks formed thereon by<br>
irradiating a laser beam emitted from a light source and<br>
forming microscopic spots on a recording layer of the optical<br>
disk. The optical disk apparatus may also be configured to<br>
reproduce information based on light reflected from the<br>
recording layer. The optical disk apparatus may include an<br>
objective lens, an optical system for guiding a light flux<br>
irradiated from the light source to the recording layer and<br>
guiding a reflected light flux that is reflected from the<br>
recording layer to a predetermined light receiving position,<br>
and an optical pickup device including an optical detector<br>
that is disposed at the light receiving position, for example.<br>
Information may be recorded on an optical disk<br>
based on the lengths of mark/space areas having differing<br>
reflection rates and combinations thereof. Upon recording<br>
information on an optical disk using an optical disk apparatus,<br>
the light emitting power of the light source of the optical<br>
disk apparatus is controlled to enable a mark area and a space<br>
 <br>
-3-<br>
area to be formed at predetermined positions on a recording<br>
layer of the optical disk.<br>
For example, in the case of recording information<br>
on a rewritable optical disk such as the CD-RW (CD-rewritable),<br>
the DVD-RW (DVD-rewritable), or the DVD+RW (DVD+rewritable)<br>
that includes special alloy in the recording layer as<br>
recording material, a mark area is formed by creating an<br>
amorphous state through heating the special alloy to a first<br>
temperature and rapidly cooling the special alloy thereafter.<br>
On the other hand, a space area is formed by creating a<br>
crystallized state through heating the special alloy to a<br>
second temperature (
the special alloy thereafter. In this way, the mark area is<br>
arranged to have a reflectance rate that is lower than that of<br>
the space area. The temperature control of the special alloy<br>
as is described above may be realized by controlling the light<br>
emitting power of the light source. Upon creating the mark<br>
area, the light emitting power may be arranged into plural<br>
pulses in order to hinder influences from heat accumulation.<br>
Such a method of controlling the light emitting power is<br>
referred to as the multi-pulse recording method. Also, the<br>
maximum value of the multi-pulse light emitting power is<br>
referred to as the recording power, and the minimum value of<br>
the multi-pulse light emitting power is referred to as the<br>
bias power. Also, the light emitting power for creating the<br>
 <br>
-4-<br>
space area is referred to as the erasing power (recording<br>
power &gt; erasing power &gt; bias power).<br>
In the optical disk apparatus, before recording<br>
information on an optical disk, test writing is performed on a<br>
predetermined test writing area, referred to as PCA (Power<br>
Calibration Area), to obtain the optimum recording power so<br>
that a mark and a space may be formed on the optical disk at<br>
desired positions with desired lengths (e.g., see Japanese<br>
Patent No. 3259642, Japanese Patent No. 3124721, and Japanese<br>
Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2005-190643). Such a process<br>
is referred to as an OPC (Optimum Power Control) process.<br>
It is noted that in recent years and continuing,<br>
the amount of contents being recorded on an optical disk is<br>
increasing, and in turn, there is a growing demand for an<br>
optical disk with increased recording capacity. In this<br>
respect, an optical disk that is arranged to have light<br>
irradiated thereon from one side and includes plural recording<br>
layers is being developed (referred to as 'single-sided<br>
multilayer optical disk' hereinafter) as one way of increasing<br>
the recording capacity of the optical disk, and an optical<br>
disk apparatus configured to perform processes on such a<br>
single-sided multilayer optical disk is also being developed.<br>
It is noted that in the single-sided multilayer<br>
optical disk, the light emitting power has to be controlled<br>
with greater accuracy. With the growing demand for higher<br>
 <br>
-5-<br>
recording speed, it is expected that a recording operation<br>
capable of stably recording information on a single-sided<br>
multilayer optical disk with good recording quality may not be<br>
realized based on the optimum recording power obtained through<br>
conventional power determining methods such as those disclosed<br>
in Japanese Patent No. 3259642, Japanese Patent No. 3124721,<br>
or Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2005-190643, for<br>
example.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
In the following, preferred embodiments of the<br>
present invention are described with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram showing a configuration<br>
of an optical disk 20 according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention.<br>
The optical disk apparatus 20 as is shown in FIG. 1<br>
includes a spindle motor 22 for rotating an optical disk 15 as<br>
a single-sided multilayer optical disk according to one<br>
embodiment of the present invention, an optical pickup device<br>
23, a seek motor 21 for driving the optical pickup device 23<br>
in a sledge direction, a laser control circuit 24, an encoder<br>
25, a drive control circuit 26, a reproducing signal<br>
processing circuit 28, a buffer RAM 34, a buffer manager 37,<br>
an interface 38, a flash memory 39, a CPU 40, and a RAM 41,<br>
for example. It is noted that arrows shown in FIG. 1<br>
illustrate representative flow directions of signals and<br>
 <br>
-15-<br>
information; however, connections between the block components<br>
shown in FIG. 1 are not limited to those represented by the<br>
arrows being shown. Also, it is assumed that the optical disk<br>
apparatus 20 of the present embodiment is adapted for a<br>
single-sided multilayer optical disk.<br>
The optical disk 15 shown in FIG. 1 is a rewritable<br>
single-sided two-layer optical disk (referred to as 'two-layer<br>
phase change type optical disk' hereinafter). In one example,<br>
the optical disk 15 may include a first substrate 15a, a first<br>
information layer 15b, an intermediate layer 15c, a second<br>
information layer 15d, and a second substrate 15e as is shown<br>
in FIG. 2. In the following descriptions, it is assumed that<br>
the optical disk 15 is a DVD type information recording<br>
medium; however the present invention by no means limited to<br>
such type of optical disk.<br>
As is shown in FIG. 2, the first information layer<br>
15b includes a first lower protective layer bl, a first<br>
recording layer b2, a first upper protective layer b3, a first<br>
reflective layer b4, and a heat diffusion layer b5 that are<br>
arranged in this order from the first substrate 15a side to<br>
the intermediate layer 15c side. The second information layer<br>
15d includes a second lower protective layer dl, a second<br>
recording layer d2, a second upper protective layer d3, and a<br>
second reflective layer d4 that are arranged in this order<br>
from the intermediate layer 15c side to the second substrate<br>
 <br>
-16-<br>
15e side.<br>
It is noted that in the single-sided multilayer<br>
optical disk, an information layer other than that disposed<br>
furthest from the laser beam irradiating side is preferably<br>
arranged to have high permeability, and measures are being<br>
taken to reduce the absorption of light at the metal layer and<br>
to reduce the thickness of the recording layer. As a result,<br>
heat dissipation may not be adequately realized at the<br>
information layer other than that disposed furthest from the .<br>
laser beam irradiating side. In turn, when the<br>
crystallization speed of the recording material is fast, it<br>
may be difficult to form a mark by creating an amorphous state<br>
at the recording material. In view of such a problem, a<br>
eu tectic composition of Sb (antimony) and Te (tellurium)<br>
containing Sb at approximately 70% is preferably used as the<br>
recording material of the information layer other than the<br>
furthermost layer. For example, Ge-Sb-Te, In-Sb-Te, Ag-In-Sb-<br>
Te, Ge-In-Sb-Te, Ge-Sn-Sb-Te, or Ag-In-Ge-Sb-Te may be used as<br>
the recording material. Also, Ge-Te, In-Sb, Ga-Sb, or Ge-Sb<br>
may be used, for example.<br>
The first recording layer b2 preferably has a<br>
thickness of 4-12 nm. When the thickness of the first<br>
recording layer b2 is less than 4 nm, too much light may<br>
penetrate therethrough so that the recording sensitivity of<br>
the first recording layer b2 may be degraded and its<br>
 <br>
-17-<br>
resistance with respect to repeated recording may be degraded.<br>
On the other hand, when the thickness of the first recording<br>
layer b2 is greater than 12 nm, the light permeability of the<br>
first information layer 15b may be too low, and in turn, the<br>
recording sensitivity of the second information layer 15d may<br>
be degraded.<br>
The second recording layer d2 preferably has a<br>
thickness of 10-20 nm.<br>
The first reflective layer b4 preferably has a<br>
thickness of 5-12 nm. When the thickness of the first<br>
reflection layer is less than 5 nm, the reflectance of the<br>
first reflective layer b4 may be degraded, and it may become<br>
difficult to secure a predetermined signal amplitude. When<br>
the thickness of the first reflective layer b4 is greater than<br>
12 nm, the light permeability of the first information layer<br>
15b may be too low, and in turn, the recording sensitivity of<br>
the second information layer 15d may be degraded. It is noted<br>
that the first reflective layer b4 is preferably made of Cu<br>
and Ag in order to obtain good recording characteristics at<br>
the first recording layer b2. In one example, the Cu and Ag<br>
may be used in an alloy. In another example, Cu having a<br>
small amount of impurity element incorporated therein at 0.2-<br>
5.0 weight % may be used, the impurity element being at least<br>
one metal element selected from a group of Mo, Ta, Nb, Zr, Ni,<br>
Cr, Ge, and Au, for example, so that reproducing stability and<br>
 <br>
-18-<br>
reliability of the first information layer 15b may be improved.<br>
The second reflective layer d4 does not necessarily<br>
have to be semi-transparent like the first reflective layer b4,<br>
and may be made of any suitable metal reflective film. The<br>
thickness of the second reflective film d4 may be<br>
approximately equal to the thickness of the reflective layer<br>
of a conventional single layer phase change type optical disk,<br>
preferably within a range of 100-200 nm. When the thickness<br>
of the second reflective layer d4 is less than 100 nm, heat<br>
dissipation effects may not be obtained, and jitter may be<br>
degraded. When the thickness of the second reflective layer<br>
d4 is greater than 200 nm, substantial warping of the<br>
substrate may occur upon forming the second reflective film d4,<br>
and the mechanical characteristics of the optical disk may be<br>
degraded.<br>
The upper protective layer is configured to prevent<br>
degradation and alteration of the recording layer, reinforce<br>
the bond with the recording layer, and improve recording<br>
characteristics, for example. The material used for the upper<br>
protective layer is preferably a transparent material that has<br>
good light permeability and a melting point that is higher<br>
than that of the recording layer. It is noted that in a<br>
conventional single layer phase change type optical disk, ZnS-<br>
SiO2 is commonly used for the upper protective layer, and in<br>
such a case, the mixture ratio is preferably Zns : SiO2 = 80 :<br>
 <br>
-18-<br>
reliability of the first information layer 15b may be improved.<br>
The second reflective layer d4 does not necessarily<br>
have to be semi-transparent like the first reflective layer b4,<br>
and may be made of any suitable metal reflective film. The<br>
thickness of the second reflective film d4 may be<br>
approximately equal to the thickness of the reflective layer<br>
of a conventional single layer phase change type optical disk,<br>
preferably within a range of 100-200 nm. When the thickness<br>
of the second reflective layer d4 is less than 100 nm, heat<br>

degraded. When the thickness of the second reflective layer<br>
d4 is greater than 200 nm, substantial warping of the<br>
substrate may occur upon forming the second reflective film d4,<br>
and the mechanical characteristics of the optical disk may be<br>
degraded.<br>
The upper protective layer is configured to prevent<br>
degradation and alteration of the recording layer, reinforce<br>
the bond with the recording layer, and improve recording<br>
characteristics, for example. The material used for the upper<br>
protective layer is preferably a transparent material that has<br>
good light permeability and a melting point that is higher<br>
than that of the recording layer. It is noted that in a<br>
conventional single layer phase change type optical disk, ZnS-<br>
SiO2 is commonly used for the upper protective layer, and in<br>
such a case, the mixture ratio is preferably Zns : SiO2 =80 :<br>
 <br>
-19-<br>
20. However, in a two-layer phase change type optical disk,<br>
since the first reflective layer is arranged to be thin, heat<br>
dissipation may not be adequately realized and information<br>
recording on the first recording layer may be difficult.<br>
Thereby, a material having good heat conductivity is<br>
preferably used as the first upper protective layer; that is,<br>
a material that has better heat conductivity than ZnS-SiO2 is<br>
preferably used. Specifically, metal oxides such as ZnO, SnO2,<br>
A12O3, TiO2, In2O3, MgO, ZrO2, TaO, and Ta2O5; nitrides such as<br>
Si3N4, A1N, TiN, BN, and ZrN; sulfides such ZnS, In2S3, and<br>
TaS4; carbides such as SiC, TaC, B4C, WC, TiC, ZrC; diamond<br>
like carbon; and combinations thereof may be used, for example.<br>
However, it is noted that in a case where Ag is used as the<br>
first reflective layer, deposition of a sulfide thereon is<br>
preferably avoided since the Ag and S may react with one<br>
another to cause inconveniences.<br>
The first upper protective layer b3 preferably has<br>
a thickness within the range of 3-30 nm. When the thickness<br>
of the first upper protective layer b3 is less than 3 nm, the<br>
light reflectance of the first information layer 15b may be<br>
too high so that it may be difficult to secure a predetermined<br>
modulation level. When the thickness of the first upper<br>
protective layer b3 is greater than 30 nm, the light<br>
reflectance of the first information layer 15b may be too low<br>
so that it may be difficult to secure a predetermined signal<br>
 <br>
-20-<br>
amplitude.<br>
As for the material of the second upper protective<br>
layer d3, ZnS-SiO2 may be used as in the single layer phase<br>
change type optical disk, or other oxides, nitrides, and<br>
sulfides may be used as well. Since the second reflective<br>
layer d4 is arranged to have a sufficient thickness, heat<br>
dissipation may be adequately realized upon recording<br>
information on the second recording layer d2 regardless of the<br>
material of the second upper protective layer d4. However, it<br>
is noted that in a case where Ag is used as the second<br>
reflective layer d4, deposition of a sulfide as the second<br>
upper protective film d3 is preferably avoided since the Ag<br>
and S may react with one another to create inconveniences. In<br>
one preferred embodiment, when Ag is used as the second<br>
reflective layer d4, an interfacial layer made of TiOC (e.g.,<br>
with a thickness of 4 nm) may be arranged between the second<br>
upper protective layer d3 and the second reflective layer d4.<br>
The second upper protective layer d3 preferably has<br>
a thickness within the range of 3-30 nm. When the thickness<br>
of the second upper protective layer is less than 3 nm,<br>
recording sensitivity may be degraded. On the other hand,<br>
when the thickness of the second upper protective layer d3 is<br>
greater than 30 nm, heat may be trapped leading to jitter<br>
degradation, for example.<br>
The lower protective layer is configured to prevent<br>
 <br>
-21-<br>
degradation and alteration of the recording layer, reinforce<br>
the bond with the recording layer, and improve recording<br>
characteristics, for example. The material used for the lower<br>
protective layer is preferably a transparent material that has<br>
good light permeability and a melting point that is higher<br>
than that of the recording layer. It is noted that metal<br>
oxides, nitrides, sulfides, and carbides are often used. For<br>
example, metal oxides such as ZnO, SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2, In2O3, MgO,<br>
ZrO2, TaO, and Ta2O5; nitrides such as Si3N4, A1N, TiN, BN, and<br>
ZrN; sulfides such ZnS, In2S3, and TaS4; carbides such as SiC,<br>
TaC, B4C, WC, TiC, ZrC; diamond like carbon; and combinations<br>
thereof may be used, for example. It is noted that these<br>
materials may be used alone, or a mixture thereof may be used.<br>
Also, an impurity may be included in these materials as is<br>
necessary or desired. It is noted that ZnS-SiO2, which is a<br>
mixture of ZnS and SiO2, is commonly used as the material of<br>
the lower protective layer, and in such a case, the mixture<br>
ratio is preferably Zns : SiO2 =80 : 20. ZnS-SiO2 has a high<br>
refraction index n and an extinction coefficient that is<br>
substantially equal to zero so that the absorption efficiency<br>
of the recording layer may be improved. Also, the coefficient<br>
of heat conductivity of ZnS-SiO2 is a small value so that<br>
dispersion of heat generated from light absorption may be<br>
suitably controlled. In this way, the temperature of the<br>
recording layer may be raised to its melting temperature.<br>
 <br>
-22-<br>
The first lower protective layer bl preferably has<br>
a thickness within the range of 40-80 nm. When the thickness<br>
of the first lower protective layer bl is less than 40 nm,<br>
light permeability of the first information layer 15b may<br>
decrease, and its resistance with respect to repeated<br>
recording may be degraded. On the other hand, when the<br>
thickness of the first lower protective layer bl is greater<br>
than 80 nm, although good resistance with respect to repeated<br>
recording may be obtained, light permeability of the<br>
information layer 15b may be degraded and substantial warping<br>
of the substrate may occur upon depositing the first lower<br>
protective layer bl so that mechanical characteristics of the<br>
optical disk may be degraded.<br>
The second lower protective layer dl preferably has<br>
a thickness within the range of 110-160 nm. When the<br>
thickness of the second lower protective film is less than 110<br>
nm, the reflectance of the second information layer 15d may<br>
decrease and the predetermined signal amplitude may not be<br>
obtained upon reproduction. On the other hand, when the<br>
thickness of the second lower protective layer dl is greater<br>
than 160 nm, light permeability of the second information<br>
layer 15d may decrease and substantial warping may occur at<br>
the substrate upon deposition of the second lower protective<br>
film dl so that the mechanical characteristics of the optical<br>
disk may be degraded.<br>
 <br>
-23-<br>
The heat diffusion layer b5 preferably has a large<br>
coefficient of heat conductivity in order to rapidly cool the<br>
first recording layer b2 when light is irradiated thereon.<br>
Also, the heat diffusion layer b5 preferably has a low<br>
absorption rate with respect to the wavelength of the<br>
irradiated light; that is, the heat diffusion layer b5 is<br>
preferably arranged to be transparent with respect to the<br>
irradiated light so that recording and reproduction may be<br>
performed on the second information layer d2. In this respect,<br>
the heat diffusion layer b5 preferably includes at least one<br>
of a nitride, an oxide, a sulfide, a carbide, or a fluoride.<br>
For example, the heat diffusion layer b5 may include A1N, Al2,<br>
SiC, SiN, IZO, ITO (IN2O3-SnO2) , DLC (diamond like carbon), or<br>
BN. It is noted that IZO or ITO is particularly preferred,<br>
and in the case of using ITO, tin oxide is preferably included<br>
in the ITO at 1-10 weight %. When the proportion of the tin<br>
oxide is greater or less than the above range, heat<br>
conductivity and permeability of the heat diffusion layer b5<br>
may be degraded. Also, in order to improve reliability,<br>
another element may be added at a range of 0.1-5.0 weight %.<br>
When the proportion of the added element is less than the<br>
above range, improvement in reliability may not be obtained.<br>
When the proportion of the added element is greater than the<br>
above range, the light absorption rate may increase and the<br>
light permeability may decrease.<br>
 <br>
-24-<br>
Also, in the case where IZO is used in place of ITO,<br>
internal stress within the optical disk may be reduced so that<br>
change in film thickness over time may be substantially<br>
prevented. In one preferred embodiment, IN2O3 is included in<br>
the IZO and ITO preferably at around 90 molar %.<br>
The heat diffusion layer b5 preferably has a<br>
thickness within a range of 40-80 nm. When the thickness of<br>
the heat diffusion layer b5 is less than 40 nm, light<br>
permeability of the first information layer 15b may decrease<br>
and heat dissipation may not be adequately realized. When the<br>
thickness of the heat diffusion layer b5 is greater than 80 nm,<br>
light permeability of the first information layer 15b may<br>
decrease.<br>
The first substrate 15a is preferably arranged to<br>
allow adequate permeation of irradiated light that is used for<br>
recording and reproducing information. The first substrate<br>
15a may be a made of a material that is conventionally used<br>
such as glass, ceramics, or resin. It is noted that resin is<br>
particularly preferred in view of its moldability and cost.<br>
As specific examples of resin, polycarbonate resin, acryl<br>
resin, epoxy resin, polystyrene resin, acrylic nitrile-styrene<br>
copolymer resin, polyethylene resin, polypropylene resin,<br>
silicon resin, fluorine resin, ABS resin, or urethane resin<br>
may be used. It is noted that acrylic resin such as<br>
polycarbonate resin and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) is<br>
 <br>
-25-<br>
particularly preferred in view of its moldability, optical<br>
characteristics, and cost. The surface of the first substrate<br>
15a on which the first information layer 15b is deposited has<br>
a concavo-convex pattern such as a spiral groove or concentric<br>
grooves formed thereon. This concavo-convex pattern may be<br>
formed through injection molding or a photopolymer process,<br>
for example. The thickness of the first substrate is<br>
preferably arranged to be within the range of 10-600 m.<br>
It is noted that the same material of the first<br>
substrate 15a may be used for the second substrate 15e.<br>
Alternatively, a material that is opaque with respect to the<br>
irradiated light for recording or reproducing information may<br>
be used; that is, the first substrate 15a and the second<br>
substrate 15e may be made of different materials and have<br>
differing groove patterns, for example. The thickness of the<br>
second substrate 15e is not particularly restricted to a<br>
certain range; however, the thickness of the second substrate<br>
15e is preferably arranged such that the total thickness of<br>
the first substrate 15a and the second substrate 15e may be<br>
approximately 1.2 mm.<br>
The intermediate layer 15c is preferably arranged<br>
to have a low light absorption rate with respect to the<br>
wavelength of the irradiated light for recording and<br>
reproducing information, and resin is preferably used as the<br>
material of the intermediate layer 15c in view of its<br>
 <br>
-26-<br>
moldability and cost. For example, UV curable resin, delayed<br>
resin, or heat reversible resin may be used. The second<br>
substrate 15e and the intermediate layer 15c may have a<br>
concavo-convex pattern such as a spiral groove or concentric<br>
grooves formed thereon through injection molding or a<br>
photopolymer process, for example. The intermediate layer 15c<br>
is for realizing optical isolation between the first<br>
information layer 15b and the second information layer 15d,<br>
and its thickness is preferably arranged to be within the<br>
range of 10-70 Mm. When the thickness of the intermediate<br>
layer 15c is less than 10 m, crosstalk is likely to occur<br>
between the information layers. On the other hand, when the<br>
thickness of the intermediate layer 15c is greater than 70 Mm,<br>
spherical aberration may occur upon recording/reproducing<br>
information on/from the second recording layer d2 so that the<br>
recording operation or the reproducing operation may be<br>
hindered.<br>
According to the present embodiment, the groove of<br>
the optical disk 15 is arranged to wobble at predetermined<br>
periods in a manner similar to the groove of the DVD+RW, and<br>
information may be recorded on the optical disk 15 as ADIP<br>
information through phase modulation. In the present<br>
embodiment, it is assumed that the ADIP information includes<br>
various types of information used in recording processes<br>
described below. In other words, setting value information<br>
 <br>
-27-<br>
used for obtaining an optimum recording power and an optimum<br>
erasing power is preformatted in at least one of a lead-in<br>
area or a lead-out area of the optical disk 15.<br>
In the following, a method of fabricating the<br>
optical disk 15 is described. The method for fabricating the<br>
optical disk 15 includes a film deposition process, an<br>
initialization process, and an adhesion process. In the<br>
exemplary fabrication process flow described below, it is<br>
assumed that the above processes (i.e., film deposition,<br>
initialization, and adhesion) are performed in the above order.<br>
In the film deposition process, the first lower<br>
protective layer bl, the first recording layer b2, the first<br>
upper protective layer b3, the first reflective layer b4, and<br>
the heat diffusion layer b5 are deposited in this order on the<br>
surface of the first substrate 15a on which the concavo-convex<br>
pattern is formed. The structure realized by arranging the<br>
first information layer 15b on the first substrate 15a is<br>
referred to as 'first recording member' hereinafter. Also,<br>
the second reflective layer d4, the second upper protective<br>
layer d3, the second recording layer d2, and the second lower<br>
protective layer dl are deposited in this order on the surface<br>
of the second substrate 15e on which the concavo-convex<br>
pattern is formed. The structure realized by arranging the<br>
second information layer 15d on the second substrate 15e is<br>
referred to as 'second recording member' hereinafter. It is<br>
 <br>
-28-<br>
noted that the layers may be deposited through various vapor-<br>
phase growth processes (e.g., vacuum vaporization process,<br>
sputtering process, plasma CVD process, ion plating process,<br>
electron beam vaporization process). Of these exemplary<br>
processes, the sputtering process is particularly preferred<br>
since it can realize good productivity and good film quality,<br>
for example. Generally, in the sputtering process, an<br>
inactive gas such as argon is introduced while performing the<br>
film deposition. In one embodiment, oxygen or nitrogen may be<br>
mixed into such inactive gas to realize the so-called reaction<br>
sputtering process, for example.<br>
In the initialization process, energy light such as<br>
a laser beam is irradiated on the first recording member and<br>
the second recording member, and initialization, namely,<br>
crystallization of the surfaces of the recording layers is<br>
realized. In a case where one of the layers may peel off<br>
(exfoliate) in this initialization process due to the energy<br>
of the laser beam, an over-coating process may be performed in<br>
which UV resin is spin coated on the heat diffusion layer b5<br>
and the second lower protective layer dl, respectively, after<br>
which ultraviolet rays are irradiated on the UV resin, for<br>
example.<br>
In the adhesion process, the first recording member,<br>
the second recording member, and the intermediate layer 15c<br>
are adhered to each other. For example, UV resin may be<br>
 <br>
-29-<br>
applied to either one of the surface of the heat diffusion<br>
layer b5 or the surface of the second lower protective layer<br>
dl, and the heat diffusion layer b5 and the second lower<br>
protective layer dl may be arranged to face against each other<br>
to adhere the first recording member and the second recording<br>
member together. Then, ultraviolet rays may be irradiated to<br>
cure the UV resin. In this way, the first recording member<br>
and the second recording member may be adhered together via<br>
the intermediate layer 15c to form the optical disk 15.<br>
It is noted that in one alternative embodiment, the<br>
adhesion process may be performed before the initialization<br>
process. In this case, the first recording member and the<br>
second recording member are adhered together via the<br>
intermediate layer 15c after which the initialization process<br>
is performed on the recording layers starting from the first<br>
substrate 15a side.<br>
Referring back to FIG. 1, the optical pickup device<br>
23 is configured to irradiate a laser beam on the recording<br>
layer to be accessed out of the two recording layers b2 and d2<br>
of the optical disk 15 (referred to as 'accessing recording<br>
layer' hereinafter), and receive light reflected from the<br>
optical disk 15. As shown in FIG. 3, the optical pickup<br>
device 23 includes a light source unit 51, a coupling lens 52,<br>
a beam splitter 54, an objective lens 60, a condensing lens 58,<br>
a light receiver PD, and a drive system including a focusing<br>
 <br>
-30-<br>
actuator and a tracking actuator, for example, (not shown) for<br>
driving the objective lens 60.<br>
As is shown in FIG. 3, the light source unit 51<br>
includes a semiconductor laser LD as a light source that emits<br>
a laser beam with a wavelength of 660 nm, for example. In the<br>
present embodiment, it is assumed that the maximum intensity<br>
emitting direction for the laser beam emitted from the light<br>
source unit 51 is in the +X direction shown in FIG. 3. The<br>
collimator lens 52 is arranged at the +X side of the light<br>
source unit 51, and is configured to arrange the light emitted<br>
from the light source unit 51 to be substantially parallel.<br>
The beam splitter 54 is arranged at the +X side of<br>
the collimator lens 52. The beam splitter 54 is configured to<br>
allow light from the collimator lens 52 to pass through and<br>
diverge light reflected from the optical disk 15 in the -Z<br>
direction. The objective lens with NA=0.65 is arranged at the<br>
+X side of the beam splitter 54, and this objective lens 60 is<br>
configured to condense light passing through the beam splitter<br>
54 onto the accessed recording layer of the optical disk 15.<br>
The detection lens 58 is arranged at the -Z side of<br>
the beam splitter 54, and is configured to condense the<br>
reflected light that is divert in the -Z direction at the beam<br>
splitter 54 onto the light receiving surface of the light<br>
receiver PD. The light receiver PD includes plural light<br>
receiving elements that output signals including wobble signal<br>
 <br>
-31-<br>
information, reproducing data information, focus error<br>
information, and track error information, for example. The<br>
light receiving elements of the light receiver PD are<br>
configured to generate signals according to the amount of<br>
light received through photoelectric transfer and output the<br>
generated signals to the reproducing signal processing circuit<br>
28.<br>
The focusing actuator (not shown) is configured to<br>
drive the objective lens 60 in minute detail with respect to<br>
the focusing direction corresponding to the optical axis<br>
direction of the objective lens 60. In the present embodiment,<br>
the optimum position for the objective lens 60 with respect to<br>
the focusing direction when the first recording layer b2<br>
corresponds to the accessing recording layer is referred to as<br>
'first lens position', and the optimum position of the<br>
objective lens 60 with respect to the focusing direction when<br>
the second recording layer d2 corresponds to the accessing<br>
recording layer is referred to as "second lens position'.<br>
The tracking actuator (not shown) is configured to<br>
drive the objective lens 60 in minute detail with respect to<br>
the tracking direction corresponding to the direction that is<br>
orthogonal to the track tangential line.<br>
In the following, the light reflected from the<br>
optical disk 15 is described.<br>
When the first recording layer b2 corresponds to<br>
 <br>
-32-<br>
the accessing recording layer, the objective lens 60 is<br>
positioned at the first lens position. In this way, light<br>
emitted from the light source unit 51 may be condensed at the<br>
first recording layer b2 by the objective lens 60. Then,<br>
light reflected from the first reflective layer b4 is incident<br>
on the objective lens 60 as signal light.<br>
When the second recording layer d2 corresponds to<br>
the accessing recording layer, the objective lens 60 is<br>
positioned at the second lens position. In this way, light<br>
emitted from the light source unit 51 may be condensed at the<br>
second recording layer d2 by the objective lens 60. Then, the<br>
light flux reflected from the second reflective layer d4 is<br>
incident on the objective lens 60 as signal light.<br>
Referring back to FIG.l, the reproducing signal<br>
processing circuit 28 acquires servo signals (e.g., focus<br>
error signals, track error signals), address information,<br>
synchronizing information, RF signals, modulation information,<br>
gamma value information, asymmetry information, and amplitude<br>
information of a sum signal, for example, based on the output<br>
signals of the light receiver PD (e.g., plural photoelectric<br>
transfer signals).<br>
The servo signals acquired at the reproducing<br>
signal processing circuit 28 are output to the drive control<br>
circuit 26, the address information is output to the CPU 40,<br>
and the synchronizing signal is output to the encoder 25 and<br>
 <br>
-33-<br>
the drive control circuit 26, for example. Also, the<br>
reproducing signal processing circuit 28 is configured to<br>
perform processes such as a decoding process and an error<br>
detection process on the RF signal. Further, upon detecting<br>
an error, the reproducing signal processing circuit 28<br>
performs an error correction process on the RF signal. Then,<br>
the reproducing signal processing circuit 28 stores the<br>
processed signal as reproducing data in the buffer RAM 34 via<br>
the buffer manager 37. Also, the address information included<br>
in the reproducing data is output to the CPU 40.<br>
The reproducing signal processing circuit 28<br>
transmits the modulation information, the gamma information,<br>
the asymmetry information, and the sum signal amplitude<br>
information to the CPU 40.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, given that the reflectance of<br>
14T crystalline space is denoted as I14H, and the reflectance<br>
of 14T amorphous mark is denoted as I14L, modulation level M<br>
is defined by the following formula (1):<br>
Modulation Level M = (I14H - I14L)/I14H	••• (1)<br>
Also, given that the reflectance of 3T crystalline<br>
spaces is denoted as 13H, and the reflectance of 3T amorphous<br>
marks is denoted as 13L, asymmetry A is defined by the<br>
following formula (2):<br>
 <br>
-34-<br>
Asymmetry A = (I14H + I14L - I3H-I3L)/2(I14H-I14L)<br>
…(2)<br>
Referring back to FIG. 1, the drive control circuit<br>
26 generates a drive signal for the drive system based on the<br>
servo signal from the reproducing signal processing circuit 28,<br>
and outputs the generated signal to the optical pickup device<br>
23. In this way, the tracking control and focus control<br>
operations may be realized. Also, the drive control circuit<br>
26 generates a drive signal for driving the seek motor 21, and<br>
a drive signal for driving the spindle motor 22 based on<br>
commands from the CPU 40. The motor drive signals generated<br>
by the drive control circuit 26 are output to the seek motor<br>
21 and the spindle motor 22, respectively.<br>
The buffer RAM 34 temporarily stores data such as<br>
data to be recorded on the optical disk 15 (recording data)<br>
and data reproduced from the optical disk 15 (reproducing<br>
data). The input/output of data in the buffer RAM 34 is<br>
managed by the buffer manager 37.<br>
The encoder 25 retrieves the recording data stored<br>
in the buffer RAM 34 via the buffer manager 37 based on a<br>
command from the CPU 40, and performs processes such as<br>
modulating the retrieved signal and attaching error correction<br>
codes to the signal to generate a write signal for the optical<br>
 <br>
-35-<br>
disk 15. In the present embodiment, the generated write<br>
signal is output to the laser control circuit 24.<br>
The laser control circuit 24 controls the light<br>
emitting power of the semiconductor laser LD. For example, in<br>
a recording operation, the laser control circuit 24 generates<br>
a drive signal for the semiconductor laser LD based on the<br>
write signal, recording conditions, and the light emitting<br>
characteristics of the semiconductor laser LD.<br>
The interface 38 is a bidirectional communication<br>
interface realizing an interface with a superordinate<br>
apparatus 90 (e.g., personal computer), and may conform to<br>
standard interface schemes such as the ATAPI (AT Attachment<br>
Packet Interface), the SCSO (Small Computer System Interface),<br>
or the USB (Universal Serial Bus).<br>
The flash memory 39 stores programs described by<br>
code readable by the CPU 40 and light emitting characteristics<br>
of the semiconductor laser LD, for example.<br>
The CPU 40 controls operations of the respective<br>
units of the optical disk apparatus 20 according to the<br>
programs stored in the flash memory 39, and stores data for<br>
realizing such control in the RAM 41 and the buffer RAM 34.<br>
(Recording Process)<br>
In the following, a recording process that is<br>
performed at the optical disk apparatus 20 when the recording<br>
request is issued by the superordinate apparatus 90 is<br>
 <br>
-36-<br>
described with reference to FIGS.5 and 6. It is noted that<br>
FIGS.5 and 6 are flowcharts illustrating a sequence of process<br>
algorithms that are executed by the CPU 40.<br>
In response to receiving a recording request signal<br>
from the superordinate apparatus 90, the start address of the<br>
program corresponding to the flowchart of FIGS.5 and 6 stored<br>
in the flash memory 39 is set to the program counter of the<br>
CPU 40, and the recording process is started.<br>
First, in step 401, a command is sent to the drive<br>
control circuit 26 to rotate the optical disk 15 at a<br>
predetermined linear speed (or angular speed), and a signal is<br>
sent to the reproducing signal processing circuit reporting<br>
that a recording request signal has been received from the<br>
superordinate apparatus 90.<br>
Next, in step 403, a designated address is<br>
extracted from the recording request signal, and a<br>
determination is made as to whether the accessing recording<br>
layer is the first recording layer b2 or the second recording<br>
layer d2.<br>
Next, in step 405, ADIP information is retrieved<br>
from the optical disk 15, and the ratio  between the erasing<br>
power Pe and the recording power Pp, the target modulation<br>
le0vel Mtarget, the multiplying coefficient p for obtaining the<br>
optimum recording power Ppo, and the target asymmetry Atarget<br>
are obtained and stored in the RAM 41.<br>
 <br>
-37-<br>
Next, in step 407, an initial value of the<br>
recording power Pp is set, and the laser control circuit 24 is<br>
informed of the set value.<br>
Next, in step 409, the erasing power Pe is<br>
calculated so that the ratio between the erasing power Pe and<br>
the recording power Pp may be equal to  , and the laser<br>
control circuit 24 is informed of the calculated erasing power<br>
Pe.<br>
Next, in step 411, a command signal is issued<br>
instructing the recording of test data on a test writing area<br>
prearranged at the accessing recording layer. In turn, the<br>
test data are recorded on the test writing area via the laser<br>
control circuit 24 and the optical pickup device 23.<br>
Next, in step 413, a determination is made as to<br>
whether the test writing has been completed. If the test<br>
writing has not been completed, a negative determination is<br>
made and the process moves on to step 415.<br>
In step 415, a predetermined variation A p is added<br>
to the recording power Pp after which the process goes back to<br>
step 409.<br>
It is noted that the steps 409, 411, 413, and 415<br>
are repeated until a positive determination is obtained in<br>
step 413.<br>
When test writing of data using plural<br>
predetermined recording powers Pp is completed, a positive<br>
 <br>
-38-<br>
determination is made in step 413, and the process moves on to<br>
step 417.<br>
In step 417, the test writing area on which the<br>
test data are recorded is reproduced via the reproducing<br>
signal processing circuit 28 to acquire the modulation<br>
information.<br>
Next, in step 419, a corresponding relationship<br>
between the recording power Pp and the modulation level M such<br>
as that illustrated in FIG.7 is determined.<br>
Next, in step 421, the target modulation level<br>
Mtarget corresponding to the recording power value (Ptarget)<br>
is obtained based on the corresponding relationship between<br>
the recording power Pp and the modulation level M as is shown<br>
in FIG.7.<br>
Next, in step 423, the recording power optimum<br>
value (Ppo) is calculated based on the formula (3) indicated<br>
below:<br>
Ppo = p X ptarget ... (3)<br>
Next, in step 431, the recording power is set to<br>
the optimum value Ppo, and the laser control circuit 24 is<br>
informed of the set recording power optimum value Ppo.<br>
Next, in step 433, an initial value for the ratio <br>
is set.<br>
 <br>
-39-<br>
Next, in step 435, ε X ppo is calculated, and the<br>
laser control circuit 24 is informed of the calculated value<br>
as the erasing power Pe.<br>
Next, in step 437, a command signal is issued<br>
instructing the recording of test data on the test writing<br>
area prearranged at the accessing recording layer. In turn,<br>
the test data are recorded on the test writing area via the<br>
laser control circuit 24 and the optical pickup device 23.<br>
Next, in step 439, a determination is made as to<br>
whether the test writing has been completed. If the test<br>
writing has not been completed, a negative determination is<br>
made and the process moves on to step 441.<br>
In step 441, the predetermined variation A e is<br>
added to the ratio ε after which the process goes back to step<br>
435.<br>
It is noted that the steps 435, 437, 439, and 441<br>
are repeated until a positive determination is obtained in<br>
step 439.<br>
When test writing of data is completed using plural<br>
predetermined values of E differing from each other, a<br>
positive determination is made in step 439, and the process<br>
moves on to step 443.<br>
In step 443, the test writing area on which the<br>
test data have been recorded is reproduced via the reproducing<br>
signal processing circuit 28 to acquire the asymmetry<br>
 <br>
-40-<br>
information.<br>
Next, in step 445, a corresponding relationship<br>
between the erasing power Pe and the asymmetry A is determined<br>
based on the asymmetry information, an example of such<br>
relationship being illustrated in FIG.8.<br>
Next, in step 447, the erasing power Peo<br>
corresponding to the target asymmetry Atraget is obtained<br>
based on the corresponding relationship between the erasing<br>
power Pe and the asymmetry A as is shown in FIG.8, for example.<br>
This erasing power Peo is set as the optimum value of the<br>
erasing power.<br>
Next, in step 501, a command signal is sent to the<br>
drive control circuit 26 so that a beam spot may be formed in<br>
the vicinity of a target position corresponding to the<br>
designated address. In turn, a seek operation is performed.<br>
It is noted that in a case where the seek operation is not<br>
necessary, this step may be skipped.<br>
Next, in step 503, the recording conditions are set.<br>
For example, the recording power is set to the optimum value<br>
recording power Ppo, and the erasing power is set to the<br>
optimum value erasing power Peo.<br>
Next, in step 505, recording is allowed, and thus,<br>
data may be recorded on a designated address with optimum<br>
recording conditions via the encoder 25, the laser control<br>
circuit 24, and the optical pickup device 23.<br>
 <br>
-41-<br>
Next, in step 507, a determination is made as to<br>
whether the recording has been completed. If the recording<br>
has not been completed, a negative determination result is<br>
obtained, and the determination is made once again after a<br>
predetermined time period. If the recording has been<br>
completed, a positive determination result is obtained, and<br>
the recording process is hereby ended.<br>
It is noted that in the above-described recording<br>
process, the modulation level M is used to obtain the optimum<br>
value of the recording power Pp. However, the present<br>
invention is not limited to such an embodiment, and for<br>
example, in another embodiment, the optimum value of the<br>
recording power Pp may be obtained using the gamma valueg<br>
instead of the modulation level M as is shown in FIGS.9 and 10.<br>
It is noted that in the flowcharts of FIGS.9 and 10, process<br>
steps that are identical to those described with reference to<br>
FIGS.5 and 6 are given the same reference numerals and their<br>
descriptions are omitted. In the following, features of the<br>
recording process of the present embodiment that are different<br>
from those of the previously described embodiment are<br>
described.<br>
In the present embodiment, in step 405A, ADIP<br>
information is retrieved from the optical disk 15, and the<br>
ratio  between the erasing power Pe and the recording power<br>
Pp, the target gamma value 7 target, the multiplying<br>
 <br>
-42-<br>
coefficient p , and the target asymmetry Atarget are obtained.<br>
It is noted that the target gamma value y target is<br>
Preformatted in the optical disk 15 as part of the ADIP<br>
information.<br>
In step 417A, the test writing area on which test<br>
data are recorded is reproduced via the reproducing signal<br>
processing circuit 28 to acquire the gamma value information.<br>
Next, in step 419A, a corresponding relationship<br>
between the recording power Pp and the gamma value g is<br>
determined based on the gamma value information, an example of<br>
such relationship being shown in FIG.11.<br>
Next, in step 421A, the target recording power<br>
Ptarget corresponding to the target gamma value g target is<br>
obtained based on the corresponding relationship between the<br>
recording power Pp and the gamma value g as is shown in FIG.11,<br>
Also, it is noted that in recording processes<br>
according to the above-described embodiments, the optimum<br>
value of the erasing power Pe is obtained using the asymmetry<br>
A. However, the present invention is not limited to such<br>
embodiments, and for example, in another embodiment, the<br>
optimum value of the erasing power Pe may be obtained using<br>
the amplitude of a sum signal obtained from the output signal<br>
of the light receiver PD as is illustrated in the flowcharts<br>
of FIGS.12 and 13. It is noted that the process steps of the<br>
recording process illustrated in FIGS.12 and 13 that are<br>
 <br>
-43-<br>
identical to those described in relationship to the previously-<br>
described embodiments are given the same reference numerals<br>
and their descriptions are omitted. In the following,<br>
features of the recording process according to the present<br>
embodiment that are different from those of the previously-<br>
described embodiments are described.<br>
In the present embodiment, in step 405B, ADIP<br>
information is retrieved from the optical disk 15, and the<br>
ratio E between the erasing power Pe and the recording power<br>
Pp, the target modulation level Mtarget, the multiplying<br>
coefficient P , and coefficients such as  and  are obtained.<br>
It is noted that the coefficients ε and  are preformatted in<br>
the optical disk 15 as part of the ADIP information.<br>
In step 451, the optimum value recording power Ppo<br>
is set as the recording power Pp, and the laser control<br>
circuit 24 is informed of the set recording power Ppo.<br>
Next, in step 453, a command signal is issued<br>
instructing the recording of test data on the test writing<br>
area prearranged at the accessing recording layer. In this<br>
way, test data may be recorded with the optimum recording<br>
power Ppo.<br>
Next, in step 455, an initial value of  is<br>
determined.<br>
Next, in step 457, ε X ppo is calculated, and the<br>
laser control circuit 24 is informed of the calculated value<br>
 <br>
-44-<br>
as the erasing power Pe.<br>
Next, in step 459, a command signal is issued<br>
instructing erasure of a portion of the test writing area on<br>
which the test data have been recorded. In this step, the so-<br>
called DC erasure is performed using the erasing power Pe.<br>
Next, in step 461, a determination is made as to<br>
whether the erasure operation has been completed. If the<br>
erasure operation has not been completed, a negative<br>
determination is made, and the process moves on to step 463.<br>
In step 463, a predetermined variation A  is added<br>
to the value ε , and the process goes back to step 457.<br>
It is noted that the steps 457, 459, 461, and 463<br>
are repeated until a positive determination is obtained in<br>
step 461.<br>
When the erasure operation using plural<br>
predetermined values of ε that differ from one another is<br>
completed, a positive determination is made in step 461, and<br>
the process moves on to step 465.<br>
In step 465, the test writing area on which the<br>
erasure operation has been performed is reproduced, and the<br>
amplitude information of the sum signal is acquired.<br>
Next, in step 467, a corresponding relationship<br>
between the amplitude Wdc of the sum signal and the erasing<br>
power is determined.<br>
Next, in step 469, the amplitude Wo of a sum signal<br>
 <br>
-45-<br>
from an unrecorded area is obtained via the reproducing signal<br>
processing circuit 28.<br>
Next, in step 471, the erasing power Pedc<br>
corresponding to ε X Wo is obtained based on the<br>
corresponding relationship between the amplitude Wdc of the<br>
sum signal and the erasing power Pe.<br>
Next, in step 473, ε X Pedc is calculated, and the<br>
calculation result is set as the optimum erasing power value<br>
Peo. Then, the process moves on to step 501.<br>
It is noted that the coefficients  and  may be<br>
set at the optical disk apparatus 20 side based on the type of<br>
the optical disk or the test data erasure operation result.<br>
(Exemplary Applications)<br>
In the following, exemplary applications of the<br>
present invention are described; however, it is noted that the<br>
present invention is by no way limited to these examples. In<br>
the following descriptions, it is assumed that the so-called<br>
IT strategy (see FIG.14) is used, and the recording linear<br>
speed is 9.2 m/s, the reproducing linear speed is 3.83 m/s,<br>
and the reproducing power is 1.4 mW. Also, it is assumed that<br>
the DVD sprinter (sheet-fed sputtering apparatus) by Balzers<br>
is used as the sputtering apparatus.<br>
1. First Application<br>
On a polycarbonate resin layer as the first<br>
substrate 15a with a diameter of 12 cm, a thickness of 0.565<br>
 <br>
-46-<br>
mm, and one side having a continuous wobble groove formed<br>
thereon at a track pitch of 0.74 ε m, ZnS (80 mol %)-SiO2 (20<br>
mol %) with a thickness of 60 nm as the first lower protective<br>
layer bl, Ago.5ln4.sSb69Te24Ge2 with a thickness of 8 nm as the<br>
first recording layer b2, SnO2 (90 mol %)-Ta2O5 (10 mol %) with<br>
a thickness of 7.5 nm as the first upper protective layer b3,<br>
Cu (98.9 weight %)-Mo (1.1 weight %) with a thickness of 10 nm<br>
as the first reflective layer b4, and In2O3 (90 mol %)-ZnO (10<br>
mol %) with a thickness of 60 nm as the heat diffusion layer<br>
b5 are deposited in this order in an Ar gas atmosphere through<br>
magnetron sputtering.<br>
On a polycarbonate resin layer as the second<br>
substrate with a diameter of 12 cm, a thickness of 0.6 mm, and<br>
one side having a continuous wobble groove formed thereon at a<br>
track pitch of 0.74 m, Ag with a thickness of 140 nm as the<br>
second reflective layer, SnO2 (90 mol %)-Ta2Os (10 mol %) with a<br>
thickness of 15 nm as the second upper protective layer d3,<br>
Ago.5ln4.5Sb69Te24Ge2 with a thickness of 15 nm as the second<br>
recording layer d2, and ZnS (80 mol %)-SiO2 (20 mol %) with a<br>
thickness of 140 nm as the second lower protective layer dl<br>
are deposited in this order in an Ar gas atmosphere through<br>
magnetron sputtering.<br>
UV curable resin (e.g., KAYARAD DVD-576M by Nippon<br>
Kayaku Co., Ltd.) is applied to the surface of the heat<br>
diffusion layer b5, and the second lower protective layer dl<br>
 <br>
-47-<br>
is adhered to the heat diffusion layer b5. Then, ultraviolet<br>
rays are irradiated from the first substrate 15a side to cure<br>
the UV curable resin and arrange the UV curable resin layer<br>
into the intermediate layer 15c. In this way, a two-layer<br>
phase change type optical disk is created. In the present<br>
example, the thickness of the intermediate layer 15c is<br>
arranged to be 55 m.<br>
Then, using a dedicated apparatus for performing an<br>
initialization process, a laser beam is irradiated from the<br>
first substrate side 15a, and initialization processes are<br>
performed on the second recording layer d2 and the first<br>
recording layer b2 in this order. In the present example, the<br>
initialization process involves condensing a laser beam<br>
irradiated from a semiconductor laser (oscillation wavelength:<br>
810±10 ran) with an objective lens of NA=0.55 on the respective<br>
recording layers. The initialization conditions for the<br>
second recording layer d2 is set such that the optical disk is<br>
rotated in CLV (constant linear speed) mode with a linear<br>
speed of 3 m/s, a feed amount of 36 m/rotation, at a radial<br>
position (distance from the rotational center) of 23-58 mm,<br>
and an initialization power of 1050 mW. The initialization<br>
conditions for the first recording layer b2 are set such that<br>
the optical disk is rotated in CLV mode with a linear speed of<br>
3 m/s, a feed amount of 50 m/rotation, at a radial position<br>
of 23-58 mm, and an initialization power of 700 mW. It is<br>
 <br>
-48-<br>
noted that the light permeability of the first information<br>
layer after the initialization process is performed thereon is<br>
37.4 %.<br>
In the present example, when Ttop = Tmp = 0.188T,<br>
dTtop = 0.6T, dTera = 0.3T, and the 1T strategy is used to<br>
perform test writing on the first information layer 15b, a<br>
corresponding relationship between the modulation level and<br>
the recording power Pp as is illustrated in FIG.15 is obtained.<br>
When the target modulation level and the multiplying<br>
coefficient are determined to be Mtarget = 0.47 and P = 1.36,<br>
then Ptarget = 22 mW and Ppo = 29.2 mW. When the recording<br>
power is fixed to the above optimum value recording power Ppo<br>
and  is assigned to measure the asymmetry, data represented<br>
by FIG.16 are obtained. When the target asymmetry is<br>
determined to be Atarget = 0.05, a suitable jitter value of<br>
7.6 % may be obtained at the corresponding erasing power value.<br>
It is noted that jitter represents the temporal variation of<br>
the boundary of a binary signal with respect to a clock when<br>
the reflectances of a mark and a space are binarized into the<br>
binary signal using the slice level.<br>
2. Second Application<br>
The two layer phase change type optical disk as is<br>
described in the first example is used, and test writing is<br>
performed on the first information layer 15b in a manner<br>
similar to that described in the first example. In this way,<br>
 <br>
-49-<br>
a corresponding relationship between the gamma value and the<br>
recording power Pp as is shown in FIG.15 is obtained. When<br>
the target gamma value and the multiplying coefficient are<br>
determined to be g target =1.9 and p = 1.36, Ptarget = 22 mW,<br>
Ppo = 29.2 mW, and a suitable jitter value of 7.6 % are<br>
obtained as in the first example.<br>
3. Third Application<br>
In the present example, the thickness of the first<br>
lower protective layer bl is arranged to be 75 nm, the<br>
thickness of the first recording layer b2 is arranged to be<br>
7.5 nm, the thickness of the first upper protective layer b3<br>
is arranged to be 3 nm, and the thickness of the first<br>
reflective layer b4 is arranged to be 7 nm. It is noted that<br>
other structural features of the two-layer phase change type<br>
optical disk used in the present example are identical to<br>
those of the optical disk used in the previously described<br>
examples. It is noted that the reflectance of the first<br>
information layer 15b after the initialization process is<br>
performed thereon is 43.7 %.<br>
In the present example, when Ttop = Tmp = 0.2T,<br>
dTtop = 0T, dTera = 0.3T, and the 1T strategy is used to<br>
perform test writing on the first information layer 15b, a<br>
corresponding relationship between the modulation level and<br>
the recording power Pp as is illustrated in FIG.17 is obtained.<br>
When the target modulation level and the multiplying<br>
 <br>
-50-<br>
coefficient are determined to be Mtarget =0.46 and p = 1.29,<br>
then Ptarget = 24 mW and Ppo = 31.0 mW. When the recording<br>
power is fixed to the above optimum value recording power Ppo<br>
and  is assigned to measure the asymmetry, data represented<br>
by FIG.18 are obtained. When the target asymmetry is<br>
determined to be Atarget = -0.07, a suitable j itter value of<br>
8.1 % may be obtained at the corresponding erasing power value.<br>
4.	Fourth Application<br>
The two-layer phase change type optical disk<br>
identical to that used in the third example is used in the<br>
present example, and test writing is performed on the first<br>
information layer 15b in a manner similar to that of the third<br>
example. In this way, a corresponding relationship between<br>
the gamma value and the recording power Pp as is illustrated<br>
in FIG.17 is obtained. When the target gamma value and the<br>
multiplying coefficient are determined to be g target = 1.7 and<br>
p = 1.29, then Ptarget = 24 mW, Ppo =31.0 mW, and a suitable<br>
jitter value of 8.1 % may be obtained.<br>
5.	Fifth Application<br>
In the present example, the thickness of the first<br>
lower protective layer bl is arranged to be 75 nm, the<br>
thickness of the first recording layer b2 is arranged to be<br>
7.5 nm, the thickness of the first upper protective layer b3<br>
is arranged to be 5 nm, and the thickness of the first<br>
reflective layer b4 is arranged to be 7 nm. It is noted that<br>
 <br>
-51-<br>
other structural features of the two-layer phase change type<br>
optical disk used in the present example are identical to<br>
those of the optical disk used in the first example. It is<br>
noted that the light permeability of the first information<br>
layer 15b after the initialization process is performed<br>
thereon is 43.4 %.<br>
In the present example, when Ttop = Tmp = 0.2T,<br>
dTtop = 0T, dTera = 0.3T, and the 1T strategy is used to<br>
perform test writing on the first information layer 15b, a<br>
corresponding relationship between the modulation level and<br>
the recording power Pp as is illustrated in FIG.19 is obtained.<br>
When the target modulation level and the multiplying<br>
coefficient are determined to be Mtarget =0.48 and p = 1.26,<br>
then Ptarget = 23 mW and Ppo = 29.0 mW. When the recording<br>
power is fixed to the above optimum value recording power Ppo<br>
and  is assigned to measure the asymmetry, data represented<br>
by FIG.20 are obtained. When the target asymmetry is<br>
determined to be Atarget = -0.05, a suitable jitter value of<br>
8.6 % may be obtained at the corresponding erasing power value.<br>
6. Sixth Application<br>
In the present example, the two-layer phase change<br>
type optical disk identical to that used in the fifth example<br>
is used, and test writing is performed on the first<br>
information layer 15b in a manner similar to the fifth example.<br>
In this way, a corresponding relationship between the gamma<br>
 <br>
-52-<br>
value and the recording power Pp as is illustrated in FIG.19<br>
is obtained. When the target gamma value and the multiplying<br>
coefficient are determined to be 7 target = 1.7 and P = 1.26,<br>
then Ptarget = 23 mW, Ppo =29.0 mW, and a suitable jitter<br>
value of 8.6 % may be obtained as in the fifth example.<br>
7. Seventh Application<br>
In the present example, on a polycarbonate resin<br>
layer as the first substrate 15a with a diameter of 12 cm, a<br>
thickness of 0.6 mm, and one side having a continuous groove<br>
formed thereon at a track pitch of 0.74 m, ZnS (80 mol %)-<br>
SiO2 (20 mol %) with a thickness of 60 nm as the first lower<br>
protective layer bl, Ag2In4Sb69Te23Ge2 with a thickness of 8 nm<br>
as the first recording layer b2, In2O3 with a thickness of 5 nm<br>
as the first upper protective layer b3, Cu95Ag5 with a thickness<br>
of 8 nm as the first reflective layer b4, and In2O3 (90 mol %)-<br>
ZnO (10 mol %) with a thickness of 60 nm as the heat diffusion<br>
layer b5 are deposited in this order in an Ar gas atmosphere<br>
through magnetron sputtering.<br>
On a polycarbonate resin layer as the second<br>
substrate 15e with a diameter of 12 cm, a thickness of 0.6 mm,<br>
and one side having a continuous wobble groove formed thereon<br>
at a track pitch of 0.74 m, Ag with a thickness of 120 nm as<br>
the second reflective layer d4, TiOC with a thickness of 4 nm<br>
as an interfacial layer, ZnS (80 mol %)-SiCO2 (20 mol %) with a<br>
thickness of 15 nm as the second upper protective layer d3,<br>
 <br>
-53-<br>
Ag2In4Sb69Te23Ge2 with a thickness of 17 nm as the second<br>
recording layer d2, and ZnS (80 mol %)-SiO2 (20 mol %) with a<br>
thickness of 140 nm as the second lower protective layer dl<br>
are deposited in this order in an Ar gas atmosphere through<br>
magnetron sputtering. It is noted that adhesion and<br>
initialization processes are performed in a manner similar to<br>
that of the first example.<br>
In the present example, when Ttop = Tmp = 0.22T,<br>
dTtop = 0T, dTera = 0.3T, and the 1T strategy is used to<br>
perform test writing on the first information layer 15b, Ppo =<br>
28 mW. In turn, test writing is performed by setting the<br>
recording power to Ppo (=28 mW), and DC erasure is performed<br>
on the test writing area while changing the erasing power Pe<br>
determined by  = 0.196 within a predetermined range ±10 % of<br>
the determined erasing power Pe. Then, the amplitude Wdc of<br>
the sum signal of the output signal from the light receiver PD<br>
obtained from the light reflected from the test writing area<br>
is measured. In this way, data represented by FIGS.21 and 22<br>
may be obtained. It is noted that the amplitude Wo of the sum<br>
signal corresponding to the unrecorded portion of the writing<br>
area is 8 mV. In the present example, given that the<br>
corresponding erasing power for  (= 0.186) in a case where<br>
the signal amplitude Wdc is equal to 2 X Wo (a =2) is<br>
denoted as Pedc (= 5.22 mW), the value obtained by multiplying<br>
the erasing power Pedc by 1.1 (ε =1.1) is set as the optimum<br>
 <br>
-54-<br>
erasing power Peo (= 5.7 mW ( = 0.204)) . Upon repeatedly<br>
performing ten recording operations on plural tracks under<br>
these conditions, a suitable jitter value of 8 % may be<br>
obtained as is shown in FIGS.23 and 24.<br>
FIG.25 illustrates the respective recording power<br>
margins in a case where Pe is constant (i.e., Pe= 5.7),<br>
referred to as condition A, and in a case where Pe is equal to<br>
Pp X ε (i.e., ε =0.2), referred to as condition B. As can be<br>
appreciated from this drawing, jitter is exacerbated when the<br>
recording power is deviated from the optimum value recording<br>
power Ppo (=28 mW) in both conditions A and B.<br>
8. Eighth Application<br>
In the present example, a two-layer phase change<br>
type optical disk identical to that used in the first example<br>
is used. When Ttop = Tmp = 0.188T, dTtop = 0.6T, dTera = 0.3T,<br>
and the 1T strategy is used to perform test writing on the<br>
first information layer 15b, Ppo = 29.2 mW. In turn, test<br>
writing is performed by setting the recording power to Ppo (=<br>
29.2 mW), and DC erasure is performed on the test writing area<br>
while changing the erasing power Pe determined by  = 0.226<br>
within a predetermined range ±10 % of the determined erasing<br>
power Pe. Then, the amplitude Wdc is measured to obtain data<br>
represented by FIG.26. It is noted that the amplitude Wo of<br>
the sum signal corresponding to the unrecorded portion of the<br>
writing area is 8 mV. In the present example, given that the<br>
 <br>
-55-<br>
corresponding erasing power for ε (= 0.212) in a case where<br>
the signal amplitude Wdc is equal to 2 X Wo (a =2) is<br>
denoted as Pedc (= 5.22 mW), the value obtained by multiplying<br>
the erasing power Pedc by 1.1 ( =1.1) is set as the optimum<br>
erasing power Peo (=5.7 mW ( = 0.204)). Upon repeatedly<br>
performing ten recording operations on plural tracks under<br>
these conditions, a suitable jitter value of 7.8 % may be<br>
obtained as is shown in FIG.27.<br>
9. Ninth Application<br>
In the present example, a two-layer phase change<br>
type optical disk is used in which the first recording layer<br>
b2 is made of Ago.2In3.5Sb69.8Te22Ge4.5 with a thickness of 7.5 ran,<br>
the first upper protective layer has a thickness of 3 ran, and<br>
the first reflective layer b4 has a thickness of 7.5 nm. It<br>
is noted that other structural features of the two-layer phase<br>
change type optical disk used in the present example are<br>
identical to those of the optical disk used in the first<br>
example. Test writing is performed on the first information<br>
layer 15b under the conditions Ttop = Tmp = 0.188T, dTtop =<br>
0.375T, dTlast = -0.438T, dTera = 0.375T, and using the 1T<br>
strategy. It is noted that the negative sign "-" in front of<br>
the value dTlast signifies that the signal is temporally<br>
delayed with respect to the standard clock (see FIG.35) .<br>
A recording operation is performed once on three<br>
tracks within the test writing area (PCA) using the optimum<br>
 <br>
-56-<br>
recording power Ppo (=38 mW) after which an erase operation<br>
is performed on the recorded area using an erasing power Pe<br>
calculated based on a value  (=0.182) formatted (recorded) on<br>
a predetermined area of the disk beforehand. Then, recording<br>
may be performed on the tracks once, ten times, or one hundred<br>
times, for example, while sequentially changing the erasing<br>
power Pe to measure the resulting asymmetry in the recording<br>
operation. FIG.36 is a graph showing the measurement results<br>
obtained by performing recordings on the testing area once,<br>
ten times, and one hundred times, respectively, in the<br>
recording operation. As can be appreciated from FIG.36,<br>
differences in asymmetry are created depending on the number<br>
of recordings performed on the test writing area in the<br>
recording operation. FIG.37 is a graph indicating the<br>
respective j itters resulting from performing a recording<br>
operation on an area other than the testing area using a<br>
corresponding ε value for a case in which the asymmetry is<br>
substantially equal to 0 (zero) . As can be appreciated from<br>
FIG.37, desirable jitter values may be obtained when Ppo = 38<br>
rnW and ε = 0.172 and 0.182 (Peo = 6.5 mW and 6.9 mW)<br>
regardless of the number of recordings performed on the<br>
testing area in the recording operation for obtaining a<br>
suitable  value.<br>
In the above-described exemplary applications, a<br>
desirable jitter value may be obtained, and high quality<br>
 <br>
-57-<br>
recording may be stably performed on the optical disk.<br>
FIG.28 is a graph indicating respective recording<br>
power margins for cases A and B when recording is successively<br>
performed on the first information layer 15b ten times using<br>
5 the 1T strategy, case A corresponding to a case in which Pe is<br>
constant (= 6 mW), and case B corresponding to a case in which<br>
Pe equals PpX  ( = 0.214). FIG.29 is a graph indicating the<br>
respective asymmetries obtained in cases A and B. As can be<br>
appreciated from these drawings, when the recording power Pp<br>
10 deviates from the optimum recording power Ppo (= 28 mW) jitter<br>
is degraded to a greater extent in case B compared to case A.<br>
Also, when the recording power Pp is greater than the optimum<br>
recording power Ppo (=28 mW), asymmetry is degraded at a<br>
greater extent in case B compared to case A.<br>
15	FIG.30 is a graph indicating respective recording<br>
power margins for cases A and B when recording is successively<br>
performed on the first information layer 15b ten times using<br>
the 2T strategy, case A corresponding to a case in which Pe is<br>
constant (= 6 mW), and case B corresponding to a case in which<br>
20 Pe equals PpX ε ( = 0.214). FIG.31 is a graph indicating the<br>
respective asymmetries obtained in cases A and B. As can be<br>
appreciated from these drawings, the asymmetry and jitter are<br>
degraded to a greater extent in case B compared to case A when<br>
the recording power Pp is deviated from the optimum recording<br>
25 power Ppo as in the example using the 1T strategy described<br>
 <br>
-58-<br>
above.<br>
As is described above, regardless of whether the 1T<br>
or the 2T strategy is used, a wider recording power margin may<br>
be secured and desirable recording quality may be obtained in<br>
a case where recording is performed with a constant erasing<br>
power Pe compared to a case where the recording is performed<br>
under the condition Pe = Pp X  . In other words, when a<br>
fixed optimum erasing power Peo is determined, stable<br>
information recording may be performed even in a case where<br>
there is a slight deviation in the optimum recording power Ppo,<br>
for example (see FIGS.28 and 30).<br>
FIG.32 is a graph indicating a corresponding<br>
relationship between the recording power Pp, the erasing power<br>
Pe, and jitter. As is shown in this drawing, the points at<br>
which Pe equals Pp X ε and the points at which minimum j itter<br>
is realized do not correspond. FIG.33 is a graph indicating a<br>
corresponding relationship between the recording power Pp, the<br>
erasing power Pe, and the modulation level. FIG.34 is a graph<br>
indicating a corresponding relationship between the recording<br>
power Pp, the erasing power Pe, and asymmetry.<br>
As can be appreciated from the above descriptions,<br>
in the optical disk apparatus 20 according to one embodiment<br>
of the present invention, the CPU 40 and the programs executed<br>
by the CPU 40 realize an optimum power obtaining unit<br>
according to one embodiment of the present invention. However,<br>
 <br>
-59-<br>
in other embodiments, at least a part of the processes<br>
realized by the programs executed by the CPU 40 may be<br>
realized by hardware, or all the processes may be realized by<br>
hardware, for example.<br>
Also, in the above-illustrated embodiment, the<br>
encoder 25, the laser control circuit 24, and the optical<br>
pickup device 23 realize a recording unit according to one<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Also, in the above-illustrated embodiment, the<br>
flash memory 39 realizes a computer-readable medium according<br>
to one embodiment of the present invention that stores various<br>
programs including a program for executing the process steps<br>
illustrated in FIGS.5 and 6, FIGS.9 and 10, or FIGS.12 and 13<br>
(power determining program), for example. It is noted that<br>
such a program may be embodied as a computer program product<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Also, the recording process steps described above<br>
may realize a power determining method and a recording method<br>
according to embodiments of the present invention.<br>
According to one embodiment, in the above-described<br>
optical disk apparatus 20, first, test writing is performed on<br>
the optical disk 15 by changing the recording power and the<br>
erasing power while recording test data in a manner such that<br>
the ratio  between the recording power and the erasing power<br>
equals a predetermined value. Then, based on the test writing<br>
 <br>
-60-<br>
result, a recording power corresponding to a target modulation<br>
level Mtarget (predetermined modulation level) or a target<br>
gamma value g target (predetermined gamma value) is obtained<br>
after which the obtained recording power is multiplied by a<br>
multiplying coefficient P (predetermined coefficient) to<br>
obtain an optimum recording power Ppo.<br>
Then, the optimum recording power Ppo is set as the<br>
recording power to be used, and test writing is preformed by<br>
changing the erasing power Pe while recording the test data.<br>
Then, based on the test writing result, an erasing power Peo<br>
corresponding to a target asymmetry (predetermined asymmetry)<br>
is obtained, and the obtained erasing power Peo is set as the<br>
optimum erasing power.<br>
Alternatively, after test data are recorded on the<br>
test writing area of the optical disk 15 using the optimum<br>
recording power Ppo, the recorded test data are erased from<br>
the test writing area using differing erasing powers. Then,<br>
based on a sum signal amplitude Wdc obtained from the test<br>
writing area, an erasing power Pedc corresponding to  X(sum<br>
signal amplitude Wo obtained from unrecorded area) is obtained,<br>
and  Xpedc is set as the optimum erasing power Peo.<br>
Then, the obtained optimum recording power Ppo and<br>
optimum erasing power Peo are used to record user data on the<br>
optical disk 15. In this way, high quality recording may be<br>
stably performed on an optical disk having plural rewritable<br>
 <br>
-61-<br>
recording layers. It is noted that by applying the present<br>
embodiment, advantageous effects may be obtained particularly<br>
in a case where the accessing recording layer corresponds to<br>
the first recording layer b2 that is positioned closer to the<br>
plane of incidence of the laser beam emitted from the light<br>
source unit 51.<br>
It is noted that in the above descriptions, a two-<br>
layered phase change type optical recording medium is used as<br>
a single-sided multilayer optical disk that has light<br>
irradiated thereon from one side. The two-layered phase<br>
change type optical recording medium may be created by<br>
layering two information layers each including at least a<br>
recording layer and a metal reflective layer, and bonding the<br>
two information layers together with UV curable resin, for<br>
example. The bonding portion for realizing the bond between<br>
the information layers may correspond to an isolation layer<br>
(referred to as "intermediate layer" in the above<br>
descriptions) that optically isolates the two information<br>
layers. The information layer at a near side with respect to<br>
the light irradiating side of the optical disk (e.g., first<br>
information layer) is preferably arranged to be made of a<br>
suitable material with a suitable thickness to enable<br>
sufficient light (laser beam used for recording/reproducing<br>
information) to penetrate therethrough to reach the<br>
information layer positioned at a further side with respect to<br>
 <br>
-62-<br>
the light irradiating side (e.g., second information layer).<br>
It is noted that in the two-layer phase change type<br>
optical recording medium, information may not be adequately<br>
recorded/reproduced on/from the recording layer of the<br>
information layer at the further side (second information<br>
layer) unless a sufficient portion of the irradiated laser<br>
beam can penetrate through the information layer at the near<br>
side (first information layer). In this respect, in the first<br>
information layer, a thin semi-transparent reflective layer is<br>
preferably used as the reflective layer, and a transparent<br>
material having high heat conductivity is preferably arranged<br>
thereon. On the other hand, the second information layer does<br>
not necessarily have to have high light permeability, and<br>
thereby, a relatively thick metal reflective layer may be used<br>
as the reflective layer of the second information layer as in<br>
a conventional single layer optical recording medium, for<br>
example.<br>
It is noted that a recording operation is realized<br>
on a recording layer of a phase change type optical recording<br>
medium by irradiating a laser beam on a phase change recording<br>
material, rapidly cooling the recording material, and changing<br>
the phase of the recording material from a crystalline state<br>
to an amorphous state to create a mark. An erasing operation<br>
is realized by irradiating continuous light on the recording<br>
material and slowly cooling the recording material to realize<br>
 <br>
-63-<br>
a crystalline state.<br>
In a two-layered phase change type optical<br>
recording medium, the second information layer is arranged to<br>
include a metal layer with high heat conductivity such as an<br>
Ag layer so that a layer with good heat dissipation<br>
characteristics may be realized and formation/erasure of an<br>
amorphous mark may be accurately performed. The first<br>
information layer of a two-layer phase change type optical<br>
recording medium preferably includes a relatively thin<br>
semitransparent metal layer (e.g., approximately 10 nm) in<br>
order to realize good light permeability. Also, the first<br>
information layer preferably includes a transparent heat<br>
dispersion layer arranged on the semitransparent metal layer<br>
in order to improve heat dissipation characteristics. In this<br>
way, recording and erasure may be facilitated. However, the<br>
heat dissipation characteristics of the first information<br>
layer is still inferior to that of the second information<br>
layer having a metal reflective layer with an adequate<br>
thickness. Specifically, waste heat may not be easily<br>
dissipated so that recording or erasure may not be smoothly<br>
performed (e.g., see FIG.38).<br>
FIG.38 is a graph indicating jitters at the near<br>
side information layer and the further side information layer<br>
in a case where the multi-pulse recording method is applied to<br>
a rewritable optical recording medium, wherein a mark is<br>
 <br>
-64-<br>
formed by a multi-pulse alternating between the recording<br>
power Pp and the bias power Pb through intensity modulation of<br>
the light emitting power, the mark is erased (a space is<br>
formed) by irradiating a continuous light with the erasing<br>
power Pe, and the ratio between the recording power Pp and the<br>
erasing power Pe (Pe/Pp =  ) is arranged to be constant. In<br>
the present example, it is assumed that  = 0.18 at the near<br>
side information layer (first information layer), and  =<br>
0.409 at the further side information layer (second<br>
information layer).<br>
As can be appreciated from the example of FIG.38,<br>
the power range (power margin) at which good jitter<br>
characteristics may be obtained differ between the first<br>
information layer and the second information layer owing to<br>
differences in their layer structures, particularly, the<br>
difference in the thicknesses of their metal layers.<br>
Specifically, in FIG.38, a wider power margin is obtained in<br>
the second information layer compared to that of the first<br>
information layer. In this case, in the second information<br>
layer, once the optimum recording power Ppo is determined, the<br>
optimum erasing power Peo may be simultaneously determined by<br>
the formula Peo =  X ppo. However, as for the first<br>
information layer with a narrower power margin, good recording<br>
characteristics may not be achieved by merely determining the<br>
optimum recording power Ppo. Accordingly, in an embodiment of<br>
 <br>
-65-<br>
the present invention, the ratio £ is changed to obtain the<br>
optimum erasing power Peo.<br>
It is noted that the optical disk 15 according to<br>
an embodiment of the present invention has setting information<br>
for obtaining the optimum recording power and the optimum<br>
erasing power preformatted therein so that the optimum<br>
recording power and the optimum erasing power may be speedily<br>
and accurately obtained.<br>
Also, it is noted that in the above descriptions,<br>
the optical disk 15 of the present embodiment has been<br>
described as a DVD type optical disk. However, the present<br>
invention is not limited to such an embodiment, and may<br>
equally be applied as other types of optical disks such as a<br>
next generation optical disk utilizing light at 405 nm<br>
wavelength, for example.<br>
Also, it is noted that in the above-described<br>
embodiments of the present invention, the optical disk 15 is<br>
described as having two recording layers (information layers).<br>
However, the present invention is not limited to such an<br>
embodiment, and three or more recording layers (information<br>
layers) may be included in an optical disk applied in the<br>
present invention. In this case, advantageous effects may be<br>
obtained particularly when the accessing recording layer<br>
corresponds to a recording layer other than that positioned<br>
furthest from the plane of incidence of the laser beam emitted<br>
 <br>
-66-<br>
from the light source unit 51.<br>
Also, it is noted that in the above descriptions, a<br>
power determining program according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention is stored in the flash memory 39; however,<br>
such a program may be stored in other types of storage media<br>
such as a CD, a magneto-optical disk, a DVD, a memory card, a<br>
USB memory, or a flexible disk. In this case, the program<br>
according to the present embodiment may be loaded in the flash<br>
memory 39 via a reproducing apparatus (or a dedicated<br>
interface) adapted for the corresponding storage medium. In<br>
another example, the program of the present embodiment may be<br>
transferred to the flash memory 39 via a network such as a LAN,<br>
an Intranet, or the Internet. In other words, the program of<br>
the present embodiment may be stored or carried in any medium<br>
to be loaded in the flash memory 39.<br>
Also, it is noted that in the above-described<br>
embodiments, the optical pickup device 23 includes one<br>
semiconductor laser; however, the present invention is not<br>
limited to such an embodiment, and for example, plural<br>
semiconductor lasers that emit light fluxes with differing<br>
wavelengths may be included in the optical pickup device. In<br>
this case, at least one of a semiconductor laser that emits a<br>
light flux at a wavelength of approximately 405 nrn, a<br>
semiconductor laser that emits a light flux at a wavelength of<br>
approximately 660 nm, and a semiconductor laser that emits a<br>
 <br>
-67-<br>
light flux at a wavelength of approximately 780 ran may be<br>
included in the optical pickup device, for example. In other<br>
words, an optical disk apparatus according to one embodiment<br>
of the present invention may be an optical disk apparatus<br>
adapted for plural types of optical disks conforming to<br>
differing standards. In this case, the optical disk apparatus<br>
may be adapted for at least a single-sided multilayer optical<br>
disk having plural rewritable recording layers.<br>
As can be appreciated from the above descriptions,<br>
embodiments within the scope of the present invention include<br>
a power determining method, a recording method, an optical<br>
disk apparatus, a single-sided multilayer optical disk, and a<br>
power determining program. The power determining method<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention may be<br>
suitably applied to determine an appropriate light emitting<br>
power upon recording information on an optical disk having<br>
plural rewritable recording layers. The recording method and<br>
the optical disk apparatus according to embodiments of the<br>
present invention may enable high quality recording to be<br>
stably performed on an optical disk having plural rewritable<br>
recording layers. The single-sided multilayer optical disk<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention may be a<br>
suitable medium to which the power determining method of the<br>
present embodiment may be applied. The power determining<br>
program according to an embodiment of the present invention<br>
 <br>
-68-<br>
may enable an optical disk apparatus to stably perform high<br>
quality recording on an optical disk having plural rewritable<br>
recording layers. The power determining program may be<br>
embodied in any computer-readable medium for carrying or<br>
having computer-executable instructions or data structures<br>
stored therein. The power determining program may also be<br>
embodied in a computer program product including such a<br>
computer-readable medium. The computer-readable medium can be<br>
any available medium which can be accessed by a general<br>
purpose or a special purpose computer. By way of example, and<br>
not limitation, such a computer-readable medium can comprise a<br>
physical storage medium such as a RAM, a ROM, an EEPROM, a CD-<br>
ROM, other optical disk storage devices, other magnetic<br>
storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to<br>
carry or store desired program code means in the form of<br>
computer-executable instructions or data structures and which<br>
can be accessed by a general purpose or special purpose<br>
computer. Such a medium may include a wireless carrier signal,<br>
for example. When information is transferred or provided over<br>
a network or other communications connection (either hardwired,<br>
wireless, or combinations thereof) to a computer, the computer<br>
properly views the connection as a computer-readable medium.<br>
Thus, any such connection is properly termed a computer-<br>
readable medium. Combinations of the above should also be<br>
included within the scope of the computer-readable medium.<br>
 <br>
-69-<br>
Computer-executable instructions comprise, for example,<br>
instructions and data which cause a general purpose computer,<br>
a special purpose computer, or a processing device to perform<br>
a certain function or a group of functions.<br>
Although the present invention is shown and<br>
described with respect to certain preferred embodiments, it is<br>
obvious that equivalents and modifications will occur to<br>
others skilled in the art upon reading and understanding the<br>
specification. The present invention includes all such<br>
equivalents and modifications, and is limited only by the<br>
scope of the claims.<br>
