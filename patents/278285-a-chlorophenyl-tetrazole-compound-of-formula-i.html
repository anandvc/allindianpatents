				<td>ARYLPROPIONAMIDE, ARYLACRYLAMIDE, ARYLPROPYNAMIDE, OR ARYLMETHYLUREA ANALOGS AS FACTOR XIA INHIBITORS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates generally to novel arylpropionamide,<br>
arylacrylamide, arylpropynamide, or arylmethylurea compounds, and analogues thereof, which inhibit factor XIa and/or plasma kallikrein, compositions containing them, and methods of using them, for example, for the treatment or prophylaxis of thromboembolic disorders.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Thromboembolic diseases remain the leading cause of death in<br>
developed countries despite the availability of anticoagulants such as warfarin<br>
(Coumadin®), heparin, low molecular weight heparins (LMWH), and synthetic<br>
pentasaccharides and antiplatelet agents such as aspirin and clopidogrel (Plavix®).<br>
The oral anticoagulant warfarin, inhibits the post-translational maturation of<br>
coagulation factors VII, IX, X and prothrombin, and has proven effective in both<br>
venous and arterial thrombosis. However, its usage is limited due to its narrow<br>
therapeutic index, slow onset of therapeutic effect, numerous dietary and drug<br>
interactions, and a need for monitoring and dose adjustment. Thus discovering and<br>
developing safe and efficacious oral anticoagulants for the prevention and treatment<br>
of a wide range of thromboembolic disorders has become increasingly important.<br>
[0003]	One approach is to inhibit thrombin generation by targeting the<br>
inhibition of coagulation factor XIa (FXIa).   Factor XIa is a plasma serine protease involved in the regulation of blood coagulation, which is initiated in vivo by the binding of tissue factor (TF) to factor VII (FVII) to generate factor VIIa (FVIIa). The resulting TFrFVIIa complex activates factor LX (FIX) and factor X (FX) that leads to the production of factor Xa (FXa). The generated FXa catalyzes the transformation of prothrombin into small amounts of thrombin before this pathway is shut down by tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPi). The process of coagulation is then further propagated via the feedback activation of Factors V, VIII and XI by catalytic amounts of thrombin. (Walsh, P. N. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999, 82,234-242.) The resulting<br>
burst of thrombin converts fibrinogen to fibrin that polymerizes to form the structural framework of a blood clot, and activates platelets, which are a key cellular component of coagulation (Hoffman, M. Blood Reviews 2003,17, S1-S5). Therefore, factor XIa plays a key role in propagating this amplification loop and is thus an attractive target for anti-thrombotic therapy.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0004]	The present invention provides novel arylpropionamide,<br>
arylacrylamide, arylpropynamide, or arylmethylurea compounds, and analogues<br>
thereof, which are useful as selective inhibitors of serine protease enzymes, especially<br>
factor XIa and/or plasma kallikrein, or stereoisomers, tautomers, pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts, solvates, or prodrugs thereof.<br>
[0005]	The present invention also provides processes and intermediates for<br>
making the compounds of the present invention or stereoisomers, tautomers,<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, or prodrugs thereof.<br>
[0006]	The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions<br>
comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and at least one of the compounds of<br>
the present invention or stereoisomers, tautomers, pharmaceutically acceptable salts,<br>
solvates, or prodrugs thereof.<br>
[0007]	The present invention also provides a method for the treatment or<br>
prophylaxis of thromboembolic disorders comprising administering to a patient in<br>
need of such treatment or prophylaxis a therapeutically effective amount of at least<br>
one of the compounds of the present invention or stereoisomers, tautomers,<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, or prodrugs thereof.<br>
[0008]	The present invention also provides the compounds of the present<br>
invention or stereoisomers, tautomers, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, or<br>
prodrugs thereof, for use in therapy.<br>
[0009]	The present invention also provides the use of the compounds of the<br>
present invention or stereoisomers, tautomers, pharmaceutically acceptable salts,<br>
solvates, or prodrugs thereof, for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment<br>
or prophylaxis of a thromboembolic disorder.<br>
[0010]	These and other features of the invention will be set forth in expanded<br>
form as the disclosure continues.<br>

III.      CHEMISTRY<br>
[0049]	Compounds of this invention may have one or more asymmetric<br>
centers. Unless otherwise indicated, all chiral (enantiomeric and diastereomeric) and racemic forms of compounds of the present invention are included in the present invention. Many geometric isomers of olefins, C=N double bonds, and the like can also be present in the compounds, and all such stable isomers are contemplated in the present invention. Cis and trans geometric isomers of the compounds of the present invention are described and may be isolated as a mixture of isomers or as separated isomeric forms. The present compounds can be isolated in optically active or racemic forms. It is well known in the art how to prepare optically active forms, such as by resolution of racemic forms or by synthesis from optically active starting materials.<br>
All chiral, (enantiomeric and diastereomeric) and racemic forms and all geometric isomeric forms of a structure are intended, unless the specific stereochemistry or isomer form is specifically indicated. When no specific mention is made of the configuration (cis, trans or R or S) of a compound (or of an asymmetric carbon), then any one of the isomers or a mixture of more than one isomer is intended. The processes for preparation can use racemates, enantiomers, or diastereomers as starting materials. All processes used to prepare compounds of the present invention and intermediates made therein are considered to be part of the present invention. When enantiomeric or diastereomeric products are prepared, they can be separated by conventional methods, for example, by chromatography or fractional crystallization. Compounds of the present invention, and salts thereof, may exist in multiple tautomeric forms, in which hydrogen atoms are transposed to other parts of the molecules and the chemical bonds between the atoms of the molecules are consequently rearranged. It should be understood that all tautomeric forms, insofar as they may exist, are included within the invention.<br>
[0050]	The molecular weight of compounds of the present invention is<br>
preferably less than about 800 grams per mole.<br>
[0051]	As used herein, the term "alkyl" or "alkylene" is intended to include<br>
both branched and straight-chain saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon groups having the<br>
specified number of carbon atoms. For example, "C1-10 alkyl" (or alkylene), is<br>
intended to include C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6,, C7, C8, C9, and C10 alkyl groups.<br>
Additionally, for example, "C4-C6 alkyl" denotes alkyl having 1 to 6 carbon atoms.<br>
Alkyl group can be unsubstituted or substituted with at least one hydrogen being<br>
replaced by another chemical group. Example alkyl groups include, but are not<br>
limited to, methyl (Me), ethyl (Et), propyl (e.g., n-propyl and isopropyl), butyl (e.g.,<br>
n-butyl, isobutyl, t-butyl), and pentyl (e.g., n-pentyl, isopentyl, neopentyl).<br>
[0052]	Alkenyl" or "alkenylene" is intended to include hydrocarbon chains of<br>
either straight or branched configuration having the specified number of carbon atoms and one or more carbon-carbon double bonds that may occur in any stable point along the chain. For example, "C2-6 alkenyl" (or alkenylene), is intended to include C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6 alkenyl groups. Examples of alkenyl include, but are not limited to, ethenyl, 1-propenyl, 2-propenyl, 2-butenyl, 3-butenyl, 2-pentenyl, 3, pentenyl,<br>
4-pentenyl, 2-hexenyl, 3-hexenyl, 4-hexenyl, 5-hexenyl, 2-methyl-2-propenyl, and 4-methyl-3-pentenyl.<br>
[0053]	"Alkynyl" or "alkynylene" is intended to include hydrocarbon chains<br>

[0056]	"Haloalkoxy" or "haloalkyloxy" represents a haloalkyl group as<br>
defined above with the indicated number of carbon atoms attached through an oxygen<br>
bridge. For example, "C1-6 haloalkoxy", is intended to include C1, C2, C3, C4, C5,<br>
and C6 haloalkoxy groups. Examples of haloalkoxy include, but are not limited to,<br>

Preferred carbocycles, unless otherwise specified, are cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, phenyl, and indanyl. When the term "carbocycle" is used, it is intended to include "aryl". A bridged ring occurs when one or more carbon atoms link two non-adjacent carbon atoms. Preferred bridges are one or two carbon atoms. It is noted that a bridge always converts a monocyclic ring into a tricyclic ring. When a ring is bridged, the substituents recited for the ring may also be present on the bridge.<br>
[0059]	As used herein, the term "bicyclic carbocycle" or "bicyclic carbocyclic<br>
group" is intended to mean a stable 9 or 10-membered carbocyclic ring system that contains two fused rings and consists of carbon atoms. Of the two fused rings, one ring is a benzo ring fused to a second ring; and the second ring is a 5 or 6 membered carbon ring which is saturated, partially unsaturated, or unsaturated. The bicyclic carbocyclic group may be attached to its pendant group at any carbon atom which results in a stable structure.

Examples of a bicyclic carbocyclic group are, but not limited to, naphthyl, 1,2-dihydronaphthyl, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthyl, and indanyl.<br>
 [0060]	"Aryl" groups refer to monocyclic or polycyclic aromatic<br>
hydrocarbons, including, for example, phenyl, naphthyl, and phenanthranyl. Aryl moieties are well known and described, for example, in Hawley's Condensed Chemical Dictionary (13 ed.), RJ. Lewis, ed., J. Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York (1997). "C6-10 aryl" refers to phenyl and naphthyl. Unless otherwise specified, "aryl", "C6-10 aryl" or "aromatic residue" may be unsubstituted or substituted with 1 to 3 groups selected from OH, OCH3, Cl, F, Br, I, CN, NO2, NH2, N(CH3)H, N(CH3)2, CF3, OCF3, C(=O)CH3, SCH3, S(=O)CH3, S(=O)2CH3, CH3, CH2CH3, CO2H, and CO2CH3.<br>
[0061]	As used herein, the term "heterocycle" or "heterocyclic group" is<br>
intended to mean a stable 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, or 7- membered monocyclic or bicyclic or 7-,<br>
8-, 9-, 10-, 11-, 12-, 13-, or 14-membered polycyclic heterocyclic ring that is<br>
saturated, partially unsaturated, or fully unsaturated, and that contains carbon atoms<br>
and 1, 2, 3 or 4 heteroatoms independently selected from the group consisting of N, O<br>
and S; and including any polycyclic group in which any of the above-defined<br>
heterocyclic rings is fused to a benzene ring. The nitrogen and sulfur heteroatoms<br>
may optionally be oxidized (i.e., N—&gt;0 and S(O)p, wherein p is 0, 1 or 2). The<br>
nitrogen atom may be substituted or unsubstituted (i.e., N or NR wherein R is H or<br>
another substituent, if defined). The heterocyclic ring may be attached to its pendant<br>
group at any heteroatom or carbon atom that results in a stable structure. The<br>
heterocyclic rings described herein may be substituted on carbon or on a nitrogen<br>
atom if the resulting compound is stable. A nitrogen in the heterocycle may<br>
optionally be quaternized. It is preferred that when the total number of S and O atoms<br>
in the heterocycle exceeds 1, then these heteroatoms are not adjacent to one another.<br>
It is preferred that the total number of S and O atoms in the heterocycle is not more<br>
than 1. When the term "heterocycle" is used, it is intended to include heteroaryl.<br>

Also included are fused ring and spiro compounds containing, for example, the above heterocycles.<br>
[0065]	As used herein, the term "bicyclic heterocycle" or "bicyclic<br>
heterocyclic group" is intended to mean a stable 9 or 10-membered heterocyclic ring system which contains two fused rings and consists of carbon atoms and 1, 2, 3, or 4 heteroatoms independently selected from the group consisting of N, O and S. Of the two fused rings, one ring is a 5 or 6-membered monocyclic aromatic ring comprising a 5 membered heteroaryl ring, a 6-membered heteroaryl ring or a benzo ring, each fused to a second ring. The second ring is a 5 or 6 membered monocyclic ring which is saturated, partially unsaturated, or unsaturated, and comprises a 5 membered heterocycle, a 6 membered heterocycle or a carbocycle (provided the first ring is not benzo when the second ring is a carbocycle).<br>
[0066]	The bicyclic heterocyclic group may be attached to its pendant group<br>
at any heteroatom or carbon atom which results in a stable structure. The bicyclic heterocyclic group described herein may be substituted on carbon or on a nitrogen atom if the resulting compound is stable. It is preferred that when the total number of S and O atoms in the heterocycle exceeds 1, then these heteroatoms are not adjacent to one another. It is preferred that the total number of S and O atoms in the heterocycle is not more than 1.<br>
[0067]	Examples of a bicyclic heterocyclic group are, but not limited to,<br>
quinolinyl, isoquinolinyl, phthalazinyl, quinazolinyl, indolyl, isoindolyl, indolinyl, lH-indazolyl, benzimidazolyl, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolinyl, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolinyl, 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-quinolinyl, 2,3-dihydro-benzofuranyl, chromanyl, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-quinoxalinyl, and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-quinazolinyl.<br>
[0068]	As used herein, the term "aromatic heterocyclic group" or "heteroaryl"<br>
is intended to mean stable monocyclic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that include at least one heteroatom ring member such as sulfur, oxygen, or nitrogen. Heteroaryl groups include, without limitation, pyridyl, pyrimidinyl, pyrazinyl, pyridazinyl, triazinyl, furyl, quinolyl, isoquinolyl, thienyl, imidazolyl, thiazolyl,<br>
indolyl, pyrroyl, oxazolyl, benzofuryl, benzothienyl, benzthiazolyl, isoxazolyl, pyrazolyl, triazolyl, tetrazolyl, indazolyl, 1,2,4-thiadiazolyl, isothiazolyl, purinyl, carbazolyl, benzimidazolyl, indolinyl, benzodioxolanyl, and benzodioxane. Heteroaryl groups are substituted or unsubstituted. The nitrogen atom is substituted or unsubstituted (i.e., N or NR wherein R is H or another substituent, if defined). The nitrogen and sulfur heteroatoms may optionally be oxidized (i.e., N→O and S(O)p, wherein p is 0,1 or 2).<br>
[0069]	Bridged rings are also included in the definition of heterocycle. A<br>
bridged ring occurs when one or more atoms (i.e., C, O, N, or S) link two non-adjacent carbon or nitrogen atoms. Examples of bridged rings include, but are not limited to, one carbon atom, two carbon atoms, one nitrogen atom, two nitrogen atoms, and a carbon-nitrogen group. It is noted that a bridge always converts a monocyclic ring into a tricyclic ring. When a ring is bridged, the substituents recited for the ring may also be present on the bridge.<br>
[0070]	The term "counterion" is used to represent a negatively charged species<br>
such as chloride, bromide, hydroxide, acetate, and sulfate.<br>
[0071]	When a dotted ring is used within a ring structure, this indicates that<br>
the ring structure may be saturated, partially saturated or unsaturated.<br>
[0072]	As referred to herein, the term "substituted" means that at least one<br>
hydrogen atom is replaced with a non-hydrogen group, provided that normal valencies are maintained and that the substitution results in a stable compound. When a substituent is keto (i.e., =O), then 2 hydrogens on the atom are replaced. Keto substituents are not present on aromatic moieties. When a ring system (e.g., carbocyclic or heterocyclic) is said to be substituted with a carbonyl group or a double bond, it is intended that the carbonyl group or double bond be part (i.e., within) of the ring. Ring double bonds, as used herein, are double bonds that are formed between two adjacent ring atoms (e.g., C=C, C=N, or N=N).<br>
[0073]	In cases wherein there are nitrogen atoms (e.g., amines) on compounds<br>
of the present invention, these may be converted to N-oxides by treatment with an oxidizing agent (e.g., mCPBA and/or hydrogen peroxides) to afford other compounds of this invention. Thus, shown and claimed nitrogen atoms are considered to cover both the shown nitrogen and its N-oxide (N→O) derivative. In cases in which there<br>
are quarternary carbon atoms in compounds of the present invention, these can be<br>
replaced by silicon atoms, provided they do not form Si-N or Si-0 bond.<br>
[0074]	When any variable occurs more than one time in any constituent or<br>
formula for a compound, its definition at each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other occurrence. Thus, for example, if a group is shown to be substituted with 0-3 R3a, then said group may optionally be substituted with up to three R3a groups, and at each occurrence R3a is selected independently from the definition of R3a. Also, combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds.<br>
[0075]	When a bond to a substituent is shown to cross a bond connecting two<br>
atoms in a ring, then such substituent may be bonded to any atom on the ring. When a<br>
substituent is listed without indicating the atom in which such substituent is bonded to<br>
the rest of the compound of a given formula, then such substituent may be bonded via<br>
any atom in such substituent. Combinations of substituents and/or variables are<br>
permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds.<br>
[0076]	The phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable" is employed herein to refer<br>
to those compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms that are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and/or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.<br>
[0077]	As used herein, "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" refer to derivatives<br>
of the disclosed compounds wherein the parent compound is modified by making acid „ or base salts thereof. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, mineral or organic acid salts of basic groups such as amines; and alkali or organic salts of acidic groups such as carboxylic acids. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the conventional non-toxic salts or the quaternary ammonium salts of the parent compound formed, for example, from non-toxic inorganic or organic acids. For example, such conventional non-toxic salts include those derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, sulfamic, phosphoric, and nitric; and the salts prepared from organic acids such as acetic,<br>
propionic, succinic, glycolic, stearic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, pamoic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, phenylacetic, glutamic, benzoic, salicylic, sulfanilic, 2-acetoxybenzoic, fumaric, toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, ethane disulfonic, oxalic, and isethionic.<br>
[0078]	The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present invention can be<br>
synthesized from the parent compound that contains a basic or acidic moiety by<br>
conventional chemical methods. Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting the<br>
free acid or base forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the<br>
appropriate base or acid in water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two;<br>
generally, nonaqueous media like ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol, or<br>
acetonitrile are preferred. Lists of suitable salts are found in Remington's<br>
Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Edition, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, PA, 1990,<br>
the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
[0079]	In addition, compounds of formula I may have prodrug forms. Any<br>
compound that will be converted in vivo to provide the bioactive agent (i.e., a compound of formula I) is a prodrug within the scope and spirit of the invention. Various forms of prodrugs are well known in the art. For examples of such prodrug derivatives, see:<br>

[0080]	Compounds containing a carboxy group can form physiologically<br>
hydrolyzable esters that serve as prodrugs by being hydrolyzed in the body to yield formula I compounds per se. Such prodrugs are preferably administered orally since hydrolysis in many instances occurs principally under the influence of the digestive<br>
enzymes. Parenteral administration may be used where the ester per se is active, or in those instances where hydrolysis occurs in the blood. Examples of physiologically hydrolyzable esters of compounds of formula I include C1-6alkyl, C1-6alkylbenzyl, 4-methoxybenzyl, indanyl, phthalyl, methoxymethyl, C1-6 alkanoyloxy-C1-6alkyl {e.g. acetoxymethyl, pivaloyloxymethyl or propionyloxymethyl), C1-6alkoxycarbonyloxy-C1-6alkyl(e.g. methoxycarbonyl-oxymethyl or<br>
ethoxycarbonyloxymethyl, glycyloxymethyl, phenylglycyloxymethyl,<br>
(5-methyl-2-oxo-l,3-dioxolen-4-yl)-methyl), and other well known physiologically<br>
hydrolyzable esters used, for example, in the penicillin and cephalosporin arts. Such<br>
esters may be prepared by conventional techniques known in the art.<br>
[0081]	Preparation of prodrugs is well known in the art and described in, for<br>
example, Medicinal Chemistry: Principles and Practice, ed. F. D. King, The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK, 1994.<br>
[0082]	Isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention, i.e., wherein<br>
one or more of the atoms described are replaced by an isotope of that atom {e.g., 12C<br>
replaced by 13C or by 14C; and isotopes of hydrogen include tritium and deuterium),<br>
are also provided herein. Such compounds have a variety of potential uses, e.g., as<br>
standards and reagents in determining the ability of a potential pharmaceutical<br>
compound to bind to target proteins or receptors, or for imaging compounds of this<br>
invention bound to biological receptors in vivo or in vitro.<br>
[0083]	Compounds of the present invention are, subsequent to their<br>
preparation, preferably isolated and purified to obtain a composition containing an amount by weight equal to or greater than 98%, preferably 99%, compound of the present invention ("substantially pure"), which is then used or formulated as described herein. Such "substantially pure" compounds are also contemplated herein as part of the present invention.<br>
[0084]	"Stable compound" and "stable structure" are meant to indicate a<br>
compound that is sufficiently robust to survive isolation to a useful degree of purity from a reaction mixture, and formulation into an efficacious therapeutic agent. It is preferred that compounds of the present invention do not contain a N-halo, S(O)2H,<br>
or S(O)H group.<br>
 [0085]	The term "solvate" means a physical association of a compound of this<br>
invention with one or more solvent molecules, whether organic or inorganic. This physical association includes hydrogen bonding. In certain instances the solvate will be capable of isolation, for example when one or more solvent molecules are incorporated in the crystal lattice of the crystalline solid. "Solvate" encompasses both solution-phase and isolable solvates. Exemplary solvates include, but are not limited to, hydrates, ethanolates, methanolates, and isopropanolates. Methods of solvation are generally known in the art.<br>

 [0087]	The compounds of the present invention can be prepared in a number<br>
of ways known to one skilled in the art of organic synthesis. The compounds of the<br>
present invention can be synthesized using the methods described below, together<br>
with synthetic methods known in the art of synthetic organic chemistry, or by<br>
variations thereon as appreciated by those skilled in the art. Preferred methods<br>
include, but are not limited to, those described below. The reactions are performed in<br>
a solvent or solvent mixture appropriate to the reagents and materials employed and<br>
suitable for the transformations being effected. It will be understood by those skilled<br>
in the art of organic synthesis that the functionality present on the molecule should be<br>
consistent with the transformations proposed. This will sometimes require a judgment<br>
to modify the order of the synthetic steps or to select one particular process scheme<br>

[0088]	It will also be recognized that another major consideration in the<br>

Condensation of an appropriately functionalized amine intermediate la with a suitably substituted benzylisocyanate lb in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or methylene chloride in the presence of a base such as triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine or potassium carbonate provides ureas of formula lc. Alternatively, ureas of formula lc of this invention can be prepared by condensation of an amine intermediate la with carbonyl diimidazole in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or N,N-dimethylformamide followed by treatment in situ with an suitably substituted benzyl amine Id. Urea linked compounds of this invention of formula lc can also be prepared by condensation of amine intermediate la withp-nitrophenylchloroformate in the presence of a suitable base such as triethylamine, followed by treatment of the resulting /?-nitrophenylcarbamate with an appropriate substituted amine Id<br>

 [0093]	Imidazole compounds of this invention wherein Li is -(CH2)2-,<br>

Reagent combinations which may be employed for the coupling of amines of formula la with suitably substituted carboxylic acids include, but are not limited to: BOP-reagent and triethylamine, EDCI, HOBt, and N-methylmorpholine, or HATU and Hunig's base (DIPEA). Solvents suitable for this transformation include, but are not limited to tetrahydrofuran and dimethylformamide. Coupling of amines of formula la with suitably substituted carboxylic acid chlorides or mixed anhydrides derived from carboxylic acids of formula 5a as shown in Scheme 5 can be carried out in solvents such as methylene chloride or tetrahydrofuran in the presence of a base such as triethylamine, N,N-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) or potassium carbonate. It should be recognized by one skilled in the art that the choice of amide bond forming method may be influenced by the nature of the substiuents on the group A in 5a, or and that it may be necessary to introduce the final R1 and/or R2 groups on to ring A at a later stage in the synthesis if these groups are not compatible with the coupling method to be used for the formation of the amide bond shown in Scheme 5.<br>

[0097]	Imidazole compounds useful for the synthesis of the compounds of this<br>
invention may be synthesized according to a modification of the method described by Contour-Galcera et al. (Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2001, 77(5), 741-745) as outlined in Scheme 7. An appropriately N-protected glycine derivative 7a is reacted with an alpha-bromoketone 7b in a suitable inert solvent, such as dimethylformamide or tetrahydrofuran in the presence of a base, such as cesium carbonate or potassium bicarbonate to form a ketoester 7c, which when heated in the presence of excess ammonium acetate in a suitable solvent, such as xylene at reflux, with removal of water, provides imidazoles of formula 7d. Imidazole formation can also be carried out by combining the keto ester 7c and ammonium acetate in a suitable solvent, such as xylene or a mixture of xylene and ethanol in a sealed tube using microwave heating. Deprotection then provides aminomethylimidazole compounds 7e. Alternately, treatment of imidazole 7d with a brominating or chlorinating agent, such as N-bromosuccinimide or N-chlorosuccinimide, in a suitable solvent such as acetonitrile or chloroform at a temperature from room temperature to reflux, followed by removal of the amine protecting group provides bromo or chloroimidazoles of formula 7f.<br>
Scheme 7<br>
(Scheme Removed) <br>
 [0098]	An alternate synthesis of imidazoles compounds useful the preparing<br>
of compounds of this invention is shown in Scheme 8. A mixture of a suitably<br>
protected amino acetaldehyde 8a, glyoxal trimeric dihydrate and ammonia are<br>
combined in a suitable solvent such as methanol and allowed to react with stirring at<br>
room temperature. The resulting imidazole 8b is dissolved in a suitable solvent such<br>
as chloroform and brominated using, for example, N-bromosuccinimide. Other<br>
brominating reagents may be employed, such as bromine, and other solvents suitable<br>
for bromination conditions, such as methylene chloride or carbon tetrachloride, may<br>
be used. The resulting 4,5-dibromo imidazole 8c is treated with a reducing agent such<br>
as sodium hydrogen sulfite utilizing a biphasic solvent system consisting of, for<br>
example, 1,4-dioxane and water, and a phase transfer catalyst such as<br>
tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate to provide mono-bromoimidazoles 8d.<br>
Reaction of this bromo intermediate under Suzuki coupling conditions with a suitably<br>
functionalized aryl boronic acid or ester or heteroaryl boronic acid or ester in a<br>
suitable solvent such as 1,4-dioxane, dimethoxyethane or toluene, at elevated<br>
temperature in the presence of a catalyst, such as palladium (I) tri-tert-butylphosphine<br>
bromide dimer and a base such as anhydrous tribasic potassium phosphate according<br>
to a modified procedure of Zhong et al. {Org. Lett. 2004, 6, 929) and Bellini et al.<br>
(Synthesis 2004, 75, 2419) provides compounds of formula 8e. Other reagent<br>
combinations that may be utilized for the Suzuki coupling procedure are palladium tris-(dibenzylidene-acetone) palladium (O), tri-(tert-butyl)-phosphonium tetra-fluoroborate, and tribasic potassium phosphate. Deprotection of 8e provides aminomethylimidazoles of formula 8f. Alternatively imidazoles 8e can be chlorinated or brominated if desired using the procedures described in Scheme 7 prior to removal of the amine protecting group to give compounds 8g.<br>

 [0099]	Alternatively, imidazole compounds of this invention can be prepared<br>
by introduction of R3 groups via palladium-mediated coupling to an intermediate 4-bromo-5-chloroimidazole intermediate prepared as shown in Scheme 9.<br>
Scheme 9<br>
(Scheme Removed) <br>
 [00100]	Alternate boronic acid or boronic ester coupling partners that are<br>
commercially available or readily synthesized by methods known to one skilled in the art may be employed in this palladium-mediated step to afford additional compounds of this invention. In cases where suitably substituted boronic acids are not commercially available, a modification to this approach may be adopted wherein an aryl halide is subjected to a palladium mediated coupling with a diboron species such as bis(pinacolato) diboron to provide the corresponding 4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-[l,3,2]dioxaborolane intermediate using the method of Ishiyama, T. et al. (J. Org. Chem. 1995, 60(23), 7508-7510). Alternately, this same intermediate can be prepared by reaction of the intermediate halide with the corresponding dialkoxyhydroborane as described by Murata et al. (J. Org. Chem. 1997, 52(19), 6458-6459). The boron pinacolate intermediates can be used in place of boronic acids for coupling to the aryl/heteroaryl halides or triflates or the boron pinacolate intermediate can be converted to the boronic acids. Alternately, the corresponding boronic acids can be prepared by metal-halogen exchange of the aryl/heteroaryl halide, quenching with a trialkoxyborate reagent, and aqueous workup to provide the boronic acids (Miyaura, N.; Suzuki, A. Chem. Review, 1995, 95, 2457).<br>
[00101]	It is also realized that the scope of intermediate synthesis can be further<br>
extended outside the use of Suzuki methodology since the precursor aryl halides or triflates described above are also precursors for Stille, Negishi, Hiyama, and Kumada-type cross coupling methodologies (Tsuji, J. Transition Metal Reagents and Catalysts: Innovations in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2000; Tsuji, J.<br>

[00102]	As used in Schemes 7, 8 and 9 above, R3 denotes a group as previously<br>
defined above, or a suitably functionalized precursor to an R3 group as defined in the detailed description of the invention above. It should be recognized by one skilled in the art that certain functional groups present in the compounds of this invention must, by virtue of incompatibility with the formation of the imidazole shown in Schemes 7-<br>
9,	be incorporated into the final compounds after the imidazole ring has been formed.<br>
Examples of such functional groups include, but are not limited to, carbamoyl,<br>
aminoindazolyl, aminobenzisoxazolyl, and 4-hydroxyquinolinyl. An example of<br>
modification of the R3 group to introduce a carbamoyl group is illustrated in Scheme<br>
10,	wherein hydrolysis of a nitrile precursor 10a using, for example, potassium<br>
carbonate, hydrogen peroxide, in DMSO as solvent, according to the method of<br>
Katritzky et al. (Synthesis 1989, 12, 949-50) provides the corresponding carboxamide<br>

 [00103]	Compounds of this invention where R3 is an 4-aminoquinazoIine, 3-<br>
aminoindazole or 3-aminobenzisoxazole group can be prepared from a common imidazole precursor 11a bearing an ortho fluorobenzonitrile substituent as shown in Scheme 11.     Amino-indazole compounds lib are obtained by heating 11a with hydrazine or hydrazine monohydrate in a suitable solvent, such as n-butanol or ethanol either conventially or via microwave irradiation at a temperature between 80 and 160°C. The aminoquinazoline lie may be prepared by combining 11a with formamidine acetate, or other suitable salt forms, in a suitable solvent such as dimethyl acetamide or dimethyl formamide, and heating to approximately 140 °C. Similarly the aminobenzisoxazoles lid may be prepared from fluoro nitrile precursor 11a by treatment with acetoxyhydroxamic acid in the presence of a base such as<br>
potassium carbonate in a suitable solvent such as wet DMF. It is also understood that in some instances it will be advantageous to protect the imidazole NH prior to manipulation of the functionality on R3 in order to avoid potential side reactions or to improve the yields of such transformations. Suitable protecting groups for the imidazole NH include, but are not limited to, 4-methoxybenzyl, methoxymethyl, of trimethylsilylethyoxymethyl groups.<br>

For example, a synthesis of 4-(2-bromoacetyl)-2-fluoro-benzonitrile is illustrated in Scheme 12. Palladium catalyzed cyanation of 4-bromo-3-fluoro-benzoic acid 12a provides nitrile 12b. The nitrile 12b thus produced is treated sequentially with oxalyl chloride in a suitable solvent, such as dichloromethane, containing a few drops of DMF, then treated with trimethylsilyldiazomethane in a suitable solvent or solvent combination, such as acetonitrile and hexane. The intermediate diazoketone is isolated and treated with hydrobromic acid in acetic acid to provide the alpha bromoketone 12c. Various other methods for displacement of aryl bromides with cyanide reagents and for the<br>
conversion of carboxylic acids into the homologated alpha bromoketones are known in the literature and can be applied to prepare additional starting materials useful for the synthesis of compounds of this invention.<br>

The resulting methyl ketone 13b is combined with bromine or another suitable brominating reagent in a suitable solvent, such as chloroform or methylene chloride, to produce the bromoketone 13c.<br>

Removal of the amine protecting group provides substituted aminomethylpyridine intermediates of formula 15b, 15c or 15d, respectively, which can be used for the synthesis of amides, ureas, carbamates and hydrazides of this invention using the methods described above.<br>

Substitution of aminomethylpyridine intermediates of formulae 15b, 15c or 15d for aminomethylimidazole compounds la in Schemes 1, 3 and 5 above will then provide pyridine compounds of this invention. These pyridine compounds of this invention can be oxidized with meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, in a solvent such as methylene chloride or chloroform, to give the corresponding pyridine N-oxide compounds of this invention.<br>
[00110]	Representative aminomethyl pyridone compounds of this invention can<br>
be prepared as shown in Scheme 16. Compound 16d can be prepared in two steps according to a modified procedure described by Resmini (Resmini, M. et at, Tetrahedron Asymmetry, 2004,15, 1847).   A suitably protected amino ester 16a can be converted to the corresponding P-ketophosphonate 16b by treatment with lithium dimethylmethylphosphonate. Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction of 16b and a suitably substituted aldehyde 16c in the presence of base such as potassium carbonate<br>
in a solvent such as ethanol or tetrahydrofuran gives the a,P-unsaturated ketone 16d. Condensation of 16d with l-(ethoxycarbonylmethyl)-pyrdinium chloride or l-(carbamoylmethyl)-pyridinium chloride in the presence of ammonium acetate in a solvent such as ethanol or glacial acetic acid generates the pyridone 16e.

hemostasis, it is also involved in many pathological conditions. In thrombosis, a blood clot, or thrombus, may form and obstruct circulation locally, causing ischemia and organ damage. Alternatively, in a process known as embolism, the clot may dislodge and subsequently become trapped in a distal vessel, where it again causes ischemia and organ damage. Diseases arising from pathological thrombus formation are collectively referred to as thromboembolic disorders and include acute coronary syndrome, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, thrombosis in the cavity of the heart, ischemic stroke, deep vein thrombosis, peripheral occlusive arterial disease, transient ischemic attack, and pulmonary embolism. In addition, thrombosis occurs on artificial surfaces in contact with blood, including catheters, stents, and artificial heart valves.<br>
[00120]	Some conditions contribute to the risk of developing thrombosis. For<br>
example, alterations of the vessel wall, changes in the flow of blood, and alterations in the composition of the vascular compartment. These risk factors are collectively known as Virchow's triad. (Hemostasis and Thrombosis, Basic Principles and Clinical practice, page 853, 5th Edition, 2006, edited by Colman, R.W. et al. Published by Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins)<br>
[00121]	Antithrombotic agents are frequently given to patients at risk of<br>
developing thromboembolic disease because of the presence of one or more<br>
predisposing risk factors from Virchow's triad to prevent formation of an occlusive thrombus (primary prevention). For example, in an orthopedic surgery setting (e.g., hip and knee replacement), an antithrombotic agent is frequently administered prior to a surgical procedure. The antithrombotic agent counterbalances the prothrombotic stimulus exerted by vascular flow alterations (stasis), potential surgical vessel wall injury, as well as changes in the composition of the blood due to the acute phase response related to surgery. Another example of the use of an antithrombotic agent for primary prevention is dosing with aspirin, a platelet activation inhibitor, in patients at risk for developing thrombotic cardiovascular disease. Well recognized risk factors in this setting include age, male gender, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, lipid alterations, and obesity.<br>
[00122]	Antithrombotic agents are also indicated for secondary prevention,<br>
following an initial thrombotic episode. For example, patients with mutations in factor V (also known as factor V Leiden) and additional risk factors (e.g., pregnancy), are dosed with anticoagulants to prevent the reoccurrence of venous thrombosis. Another example entails secondary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with a history of acute myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome. In a clinical setting, a combination of aspirin and clopidogrel (or other thienopyridines) may be used to prevent a second thrombotic event.<br>
[00123]	Antithrombotic agents are also given to treat the disease state (i.e., by<br>
arresting its development) after it has already started. For example, patients presenting with deep vein thrombosis are treated with anticoagulants (i.e. heparin, warfarin, or LMWH) to prevent further growth of the venous occlusion. Over time, these agents also cause a regression of the disease state because the balance between prothrombotic factors and anticoagulantprofibrinolytic pathways is changed in favor of the latter. Examples on the arterial vascular bed include the treatment of patients with acute myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome with aspirin and clopidogrel to prevent further growth of vascular occlusions and eventually leading to a regression of thrombotic occlusions.<br>
[00124]	Thus, antithrombotic agents are used widely for primary and secondary<br>
prevention (i.e., prophylaxis or risk reduction) of thromboembolic disorders, as well as treatment of an already existing thrombotic process. Drugs that inhibit blood<br>
coagulation, or anticoagulants, are "pivotal agents for prevention and treatment of<br>
thromboembolic disorders" (Hirsh, J. et al. Blood 2005,105,453-463).<br>
[00125]	An alternative way of initiation of coagulation is operative when blood<br>
is exposed to artificial surfaces (e.g., during hemodialysis, 'on-pump' cardiovascular surgery, vessel grafts, bacterial sepsis), on cell surfaces, cellular receptors, cell debris, DNA, RNA, and extracellular matrices. This process is also termed contact activation. Surface absorption of factor XII leads to a conformational change in the factor XII molecule, thereby facilitating activation to proteolytic active factor XII molecules (factor XIIa and factor XIIf). Factor XIIa (or XIIf) has a number of target proteins, including plasma prekallikrein and factor XI. Active plasma kallikrein further activates factor XII, leading to an amplification of contact activation. Alternatively, the serine protease prolylcarboxylpeptidase can activate plasma kallikrein complexed with high molecular weight kininogen in a multiprotein complex formed on the surface of cells and matrices (Shariat-Madar et al. Blood 2006, 108, 192-199). Contact activation is a surface mediated process responsible in part for the regulation of thrombosis and inflammation, and is mediated, at least in part, by fibrinolytic-, complement-, kininogen/kinin-, and other humoral and cellular pathways (for review, Coleman, R. Contact Activation Pathway, pages 103-122 in Hemostasis and Thrombosis, Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins 2001; Schmaier A.H. Contact Activation, pages 105-128 in Thrombosis and Hemorrhage, 1998). The biological relevance of the contact activation system for thromboembolic diseases is supported by the phenotype of factor XII deficient mice. More specifically, factor XII deficient mice were protected from thrombotic vascular occlusion in several thrombosis models as well as stroke models and the phenotype of the XII deficient mice was identical to XI deficient mice (Renne et ah J. Exp. Medicine 2005, 202, 271-281; Kleinschmitz et al. J. Exp. I Medicine, 2006, 203, 513-518). The fact that factor XI is down-stream from factor XIIa, combined with the identical phenotype of the XII and XI deficient mice suggest that the contact activation system could play a major role in factor XI activation in vivo.<br>
[00126]	Factor XI is a zymogen of a trypsin-like serine protease and is present<br>
in plasma at a relatively low concentration. Proteolytic activation at an internal R369-1370 bond yields a heavy chain (369 amino acids) and a light chain (238 amino acids).<br>
The latter contains a typical trypsin-like catalytic triad (H413, D464, and S557).<br>
Activation of factor XI by thrombin is believed to occur on negatively charged<br>
surfaces, most likely on the surface of activated platelets. Platelets contain high<br>
affinity (0.8 nM) specific sites (130-500/platelet) for activated factor XI. After<br>
activation, factor XIa remains surface bound and recognizes factor IX as its normal<br>
macromolecular substrate. (Galiani, D. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000, 10, 198-204.)<br>
[00127]	In addition to the feedback activation mechanisms described above,<br>
thrombin activates thrombin activated fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI), a plasma carboxypeptidase that cleaves C-terminal lysine and arginine residues on fibrin, reducing the ability of fibrin to enhance tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) dependent plasminogen activation. In the presence of antibodies to FXIa, clot lysis can occur more rapidly independent of plasma TAFI concentration. (Bouma, B. N. et al Thromb. Res. 2001,101, 329-354.) Thus, inhibitors of factor XIa are expected to be anticoagulant and profibrinolytic.<br>
[00128]	Further evidence for the anti-thromboembolic effects of targeting<br>
factor XI is derived from mice deficient in factor XL It has been demonstrated that complete fXI deficiency protected mice from ferric chloride (FeC^-induced carotid artery thrombosis (Rosen et al. Thromb Haemost 2002, 87,114-11; Wang et al, J Thromb Haemost 2005, 3, 695-702). Also, factor XI deficiency rescues the perinatal lethal phenotype of complete protein C deficiency (Chan et al., Amer. J. Pathology 2001, 158, 469-479). Furthermore, baboon cross-reactive, function blocking antibodies to human factor XI protect against baboon arterial - venous shunt thrombosis (Gruber et al., Blood 2003,102, 953-955). Evidence for an antithrombotic effect of small molecule inhibitors of factor XIa is also disclosed in published U.S. Patent Application US20040180855A1. Taken together, these studies suggest that targeting factor XI will reduce the propensity for thrombotic and thromboembolic diseases.<br>
[00129]	Genetic evidence indicates that factor XI is not required for normal<br>
homeostasis, implying a superior safety profile of the factor XI mechanism compared to competing antithrombotic mechanisms. In contrast to hemophilia A (factor VIE deficiency) or hemophilia B (factor LX deficiency), mutations of the factor XI gene causing factor XI deficiency (hemophilia C) result in only a mild to moderate<br>
bleeding diathesis characterized primarily by postoperative or posttraumatic, but rarely spontaneous hemorrhage. Postoperative bleeding occurs mostly in tissue with high concentrations of endogenous fibrinolytic activity (e.g., oral cavity, and urogenital system). The majority of the cases are fortuitously identified by preoperative prolongation of aPTT (intrinsic system) without any prior bleeding history.<br>
[00130]	The increased safety of inhibition of XIa as an anticoagulation therapy<br>
is further supported by the fact that Factor XI knock-out mice, which have no detectable factor XI protein, undergo normal development, and have a normal life span. No evidence for spontaneous bleeding has been noted. The aPTT (intrinsic system) is prolonged in a gene dose-dependent fashion. Interestingly, even after severe stimulation of the coagulation system (tail transection), the bleeding time is not significantly prolonged compared to wild-type and heterozygous litter mates. (Gailani, D. Frontiers in Bioscience 2001, 6, 201-207; Gailani, D. et al. Blood Coagulation and Fibrinolysis 1997, 8, 134-144.) Taken together, these observations suggest that high levels of inhibition of factor XIa should be well tolerated. This is in contrast to gene targeting experiments with other coagulation factors, excluding factor XII.<br>
[00131]	In vivo activation of factor XI can be determined by complex<br>
formation with either CI inhibitor or alpha 1 antitrypsin. In a study of 50 patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), approximately 25% of the patients had values above the upper normal range of the complex ELISA. This study can be viewed as evidence that at least in a subpopulation of patients with AMI, factor XI activation contributes to thrombin formation (Minnema, M.C. et al. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vase. Biol. 2000,20, 2489-2493). A second study establishes a positive correlation between the extent of coronary arteriosclerosis and factor XIa in complex with alpha 1 antitrypsin (Murakami, T. et al. Arterioscler Thromb Vase Biol 1995,15, 1107-1113.). In another study, Factor XI levels above the 90th percentile in patients were associated with a 2.2-fold increased risk for venous thrombosis (Meijers, J. C. M. et al. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000, 342, 696-701.)<br>
[00132]	Plasma kallikrein is a zymogen of a trypsin-like serine protease and is<br>
present in plasma at 35 to 50 ng/mL. The gene structure is similar to that of factor<br>
XI. Overall, the amino acid sequence of plasma kallikrein has 58% homology to factor XI. Proteolytic activation by factor XIIa at an internal I 389- R390 bond yields a heavy chain (371 amino acids) and a light chain (248 amino acids). The active site of plasma kallikrein is contained in the light chain. The light chain of plasma kallikrein reacts with protease inhibitors, including alpha 2 macroglobulin and Cl-inhibitor. Interestingly, heparin significantly accelerates the inhibition of plasma kallikrein by antithrombin HI in the presence of high molecular weight kininogen (HMWK). In blood, the majority of plasma kallikrein circulates in complex with HMWK. Plasma kallikrein cleaves HMWK to liberate bradykinin. Bradykinin release results in increase of vascular permeability and vasodilation (for review, Coleman, R. Contact Activation Pathway, pages 103-122 in Hemostasis and Thrombosis, Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins 2001; Schmaier A.H. Contact Activation, pages 105-128 in Thrombosis and Hemorrhage, 1998).<br>
[00133]	Also, it is preferred to find new compounds with improved activity in<br>
in vitro clotting assays, compared with known serine protease inhibitors, such as the<br>
activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) or prothrombin time (PT) assay, (for a<br>
description of the aPTT and PT assays see, Goodnight, S. H.; Hathaway, W. E.<br>
Screening Tests of Hemostasis. Disorders of Thrombosis and Hemostasis: a clinical<br>
guide, 2nd edition, McGraw-Hill: New York, 2001 pp. 41-51).<br>
[00134]	It is also desirable and preferable to find compounds with<br>
advantageous and improved characteristics compared with known serine protease inhibitors, in one or more of the following categories that are given as examples, and are not intended to be limiting: (a) pharmacokinetic properties, including oral bioavailability, half life, and clearance; (b) pharmaceutical properties; (c) dosage requirements; (d) factors that decrease blood concentration peak-to-trough characteristics; (e) factors that increase the concentration of active drug at the receptor; (f) factors that decrease the liability for clinical drug-drug interactions; (g) factors that decrease the potential for adverse side-effects, including selectivity versus other biological targets; and (h) factors that improve manufacturing costs or feasibility.<br>
[00135]	Pre-clinical studies demonstrated significant antithrombotic effects of<br>
small molecule factor XIa inhibitors in rabbit and rat model of arterial thrombosis, at<br>
doses that preserved hemostasis. (Wong P. C. et al. American Heart Association<br>
Scientific Sessions, November 12-15, 2006, Abstract 6118; Schumacher, W. et al.<br>
Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis 2005; Volume 3, Supplement 1: P1228;<br>
Schumacher, W. A. et al. European Journal of Pharmacology, in press).<br>
Furthermore, it was observed that in vitro prolongation of the aPTT by specific XIa<br>
inhibitors is a good predictor of efficacy in our thrombosis models. Thus, the in vitro<br>
aPTT test can be used as a surrogate for efficacy in vivo.<br>

[00147]	It is noted that thrombosis includes vessel occlusion (e.g., after a<br>
bypass) and reocclusion (e.g., during or after percutaneous transluminal coronary<br>
angioplasty). The thromboembolic disorders may result from conditions including<br>
but not limited to atherosclerosis, surgery or surgical complications, prolonged<br>
immobilization, arterial fibrillation, congenital thrombophilia, cancer, diabetes, effects<br>
of medications or hormones, and complications of pregnancy.<br>
[00148]	Thromboembolic disorders are frequently associated with patients with<br>
atherosclerosis. Risk factors for atherosclerosis include but are not limited to male<br>
gender, age, hypertension, lipid disorders, and diabetes mellitus. Risk factors for<br>
atherosclerosis are at the same time risk factors for complications of atherosclerosis,<br>
i.e., thromboembolic disorders.<br>
[00149]	Similarly, arterial fibrillation is frequently associated with<br>
thromboembolic disorders. Risk factors for arterial fibrillation and subsequent<br>
thromboembolic disorders include cardiovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease,<br>
nonrheumatic mitral valve disease, hypertensive cardiovascular disease, chronic lung<br>
disease, and a variety of miscellaneous cardiac abnormalities as well as<br>
thyrotoxicosis.<br>
[00150]	Diabetes mellitus is frequently associated with atherosclerosis and<br>
thromboembolic disorders. Risk factors for the more common type 2 include but are<br>
not limited to are family history, obesity, physical inactivity, race / ethnicity,<br>
previously impaired fasting glucose or glucose tolerance test, history of gestational<br>
diabetes mellitus or delivery of a 'big baby', hypertension, low HDL cholesterol, and<br>
polycystic ovary syndrome.<br>
[00151]	Risk factor for congenital thrombophilia include gain of function<br>
mutations in coagulation factors or loss of function mutations in the anticoagulant- or<br>
fibrinolytic pathways.<br>
 [00152]	Thrombosis has been associated with a variety of tumor types, e.g.,<br>
pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, brain tumors, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, gastrointestinal malignancies, and Hodgkins or non-Hodgkins lymphoma. Recent studies suggest that the frequency of cancer in patients with thrombosis reflects the frequency of a particular cancer type in the general population. (Levitan, N. etal. Medicine (Baltimore) 1999, 78(5):285-291; Levine M. et al. NEngl JMed 1996, 334(11):677-681; Blom, J. W. etal. JAMA: 2005, 293(6):715-722.) Hence, the most common cancers associated with thrombosis in men are prostate, colorectal, brain, and lung cancer, and in women are breast, ovary, and lung cancer. The observed rate of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in cancer patients is significant. The varying rates of VTE between different tumor types are most likely related to the selection of the patient population. Cancer patients at risk for thrombosis may possess any or all of the following risk factors: (i) the stage of the cancer (i.e. presence of metastases), (ii) the presence of central vein catheters, (iii) surgery and anticancer therapies including chemotherapy, and (iv) hormones and antiangiogenic drugs. Thus, it is common clinical practice to dose patients having advanced tumors with heparin or low molecular heparin to prevent thromboembolic disorders. A number of low molecular heparin preparations have been approved by the FDA for these indications.<br>
[00153]	There are three main clinical situations when considering the<br>
prevention of VTE in a medical cancer patient: (i) the patient is bedridden for prolonged periods of time; (ii) the ambulatory patient is receiving chemotherapy or radiation; and (iii) the patient is with indwelling central vein catheters. Unfractionated heparin (UFH) and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) are effective antithrombotic agents in cancer patients undergoing surgery. (Mismetti, P. et al. British Journal of Surgery 2001, 88:913-930.)<br>
A. In Vitro Assays<br>
[00154]	The effectiveness of compounds of the present invention as inhibitors<br>
of the coagulation factors XIa, Vila, EXa, Xa, Xlla, plasma kallikrein or thrombin, can be determined using a relevant purified serine protease, respectively, and an appropriate synthetic substrate. The rate of hydrolysis of the chromogenic or<br>
fluorogenic substrate by the relevant serine protease was measured both in the absence and presence of compounds of the present invention. Hydrolysis of the substrate resulted in the release of pNA (para nitroaniline), which was monitored spectrophotometrically by measuring the increase in absorbance at 405 nm, or the release of AMC (amino methylcoumarin), which was monitored spectrofluorometrically by measuring the increase in emission at 460 nm with excitation at 380 nm. A decrease in the rate of absorbance or fluorescence change in the presence of inhibitor is indicative of enzyme inhibition. Such methods are known to one skilled in the art. The results of this assay are expressed as the inhibitory constant, Kj.<br>

[00159]	Factor XIIa determinations were made in 50 mM HEPES buffer at pH<br>
7.4 containing 145 mM NaCl, 5 mM KC1, and 0.1% PEG 8000. Determinations were<br>
made using purified human Factor XIIa at a final concentration of 4 nM (American<br>
Diagnostica) and the synthetic substrate Spectrozyme H312 (pyroGlu-Pro-Arg-pNA;<br>
American Diagnostica) at a concentration of 0.00015 M.<br>
[00160]	Plasma kallikrein determinations were made in 0.1 M sodium<br>
phosphate buffer at a pH of 7.5 containing 0.1-0.2 M sodium chloride and 0.5% PEG<br>
8000. Determinations were made using purified human kallikrein (Enzyme Research<br>
Laboratories) at a final assay concentration of 200 pM and the synthetic substrate S-<br>

[00162]	The Michaelis constant, Km, for substrate hydrolysis by each protease,<br>
was determined at 25 °C using the method of Lineweaver and Burk. Values of Kj were determined by allowing the protease to react with the substrate in the presence of the inhibitor. Reactions were allowed to go for periods of 20-180 minutes (depending on the protease) and the velocities (rate of absorbance or fluorescence change versus time) were measured. The following relationships were used to calculate Kf values: (v0-vs)/vs = I/(Kj(l + S/Km)) for a competitive inhibitor with one binding site; or<br>
vs/v0 = A + ((B-A)/l + ((IC50/(I)n))) and<br>
Ki = IC5o/(l + S/Km) for a competitive inhibitor<br>
where:<br>
v0 is the velocity of the control in the absence of inhibitor;<br>
vs is the velocity in the presence of inhibitor;<br>
I is the concentration of inhibitor;<br>
A is the minimum activity remaining (usually locked at zero);<br>
B is the maximum activity remaining (usually locked at 1.0);<br>
n is the Hill coefficient, a measure of the number and cooperativity of potential<br>
inhibitor binding sites; IC50 is the concentration of inhibitor that produces 50% inhibition under the assay<br>
conditions; Ki is the dissociation constant of the enzyme: inhibitor complex; S is the concentration of substrate; and Km is the Michaelis constant for the substrate.<br>
[00163]	The selectivity of a compound may be evaluated by taking the ratio of<br>
the Ki value for a given protease with the Ki value for the protease of interest (i.e., selectivity for FXIa versus protease P = Ki for protease P/ Ki for FXIa). Compounds with selectivity ratios &gt;20 are considered selective. Compounds with selectivity ratios &gt;100 are preferred, and compounds with selectivity ratios &gt; 500 are more preferred.<br>
[00164]	The effectiveness of compounds of the present invention as inhibitors<br>
of coagulation can be determined using a standard or modified clotting assay. An<br>
increase in the plasma clotting time in the presence of inhibitor is indicative of<br>
anticoagulation. Relative clotting time is the clotting time in the presence of an<br>
inhibitor divided by the clotting time in the absence of an inhibitor. The results of this<br>
assay may be expressed as IC1.5x or IC2x, the inhibitor concentration required to<br>
increase the clotting time by 50 or 100 percent, respectively. The IC1.5x or IC2x is<br>
found by linear interpolation from relative clotting time versus inhibitor concentration<br>
plots using inhibitor concentration that spans the IC1.5x or IC2x.<br>
[00165]	Clotting times are determined using citrated normal human plasma as<br>
well as plasma obtained from a number of laboratory animal species (e.g., rat, or<br>
rabbit). A compound is diluted into plasma beginning with a 10 mM DMSO stock solution. The final concentration of DMSO is less than 2%. Plasma clotting assays are performed in an automated coagulation analyzer (Sysmex:, Dade-Behring, Illinois). Similarly, clotting times can be determined from laboratory animal species or humans dosed with compounds of the invention.<br>
[00166]	Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) is determined using<br>
Alexin (Trinity Biotech, Ireland) following the directions in the package insert.<br>
Plasma (0.05 mL) is warmed to 37°C for 1 minute. Alexin (0.05 mL) is added to the<br>
plasma and incubated for an additional 2 to 5 minutes. Calcium chloride (25 mM,<br>
0.05 mL) is added to the reaction to initiate coagulation. The clotting time is the time<br>
in seconds from the moment calcium chloride is added until a clot is detected.<br>
[00167]	Prothrombin Time (PT) is determined using thromboplastin<br>
(Thromboplastin C Plus, Dade-Behring, Illinois) following the directions in the package insert. Plasma (0.05 mL) is warmed to 37°C for 1 minute. Thromboplastin (0.1 mL) is added to the plasma to initiate coagulation. The clotting time is the time in seconds from the moment thromboplastin is added until a clot is detected.<br>
B. In Vivo Assays<br>
[00168]	The effectiveness of compounds of the present invention as<br>
antithrombotic agents can be determined using relevant in vivo thrombosis models, including In Vivo Electrically-induced Carotid Artery Thrombosis Models and In Vivo Rabbit Arterio-venous Shunt Thrombosis Models.<br>
a. In Vivo Electrically-induced Carotid Artery Thrombosis (ECAT) Model<br>
[00169]	The rabbit ECAT model, described by Wong et al. [J Pharmacol Exp<br>
Ther 2000,295, 212-218), can be used in this study. Male New Zealand White rabbits are anesthetized with ketamine (50 mg/kg + 50 mg/kg/h IM) and xylazine (10 mg/kg +10 mg/kg/h M). These anesthetics are supplemented as needed. An electromagnetic flow probe is placed on a segment of an isolated carotid artery to monitor blood flow. Test agents or vehicle will be given (i.v., i.p., s.c, or orally) prior to or after the initiation of thrombosis. Drug treatment prior to initiation of thrombosis is used to model the ability of test agents to prevent and reduce the risk of<br>
thrombus formation, whereas dosing after initiation is used to model the ability to treat existing thrombotic disease. Thrombus formation is induced by electrical stimulation of the carotid artery for 3 min at 4 mA using an external stainless-steel bipolar electrode. Carotid blood flow is measured continuously over a 90-min period to monitor thrombus-induced occlusion. Total carotid blood flow over 90 min is calculated by the trapezoidal rule. Average carotid flow over 90 min is then determined by converting total carotid blood flow over 90 min to percent of total control carotid blood flow, which would result if control blood flow had been maintained continuously for 90 min. The ED50 (dose that increased average carotid blood flow over 90 min to 50% of the control) of compounds are estimated by a nonlinear least square regression program using the Hill sigmoid Emax equation (DeltaGraph; SPSS Inc., Chicago, EL).<br>
b. In Vivo Rabbit Arterio-venous (AV) Shunt Thrombosis Model<br>
[00170]	The rabbit AV shunt model, described by Wong et al. (Wong, P. C. et<br>
al. J Pharmacol Exp Ther 2000,292, 351-357), can be used in this study. Male New Zealand White rabbits are anesthetized with ketamine (50 mg/kg + 50 mg/kg/h IM) and xylazine (10 mg/kg + 10 mg/kg/h IM). These anesthetics are supplemented as needed. The femoral artery, jugular vein and femoral vein are isolated and catheterized. A saline-filled AV shunt device is connected between the femoral arterial and the femoral venous cannulae. The AV shunt device consists of an outer piece of tygon tubing (length = 8 cm; internal diameter = 7.9 mm) and an inner piece of tubing (length = 2.5 cm; internal diameter = 4.8 mm). The AV shunt also contains an 8-cm-long 2-0 silk thread (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ). Blood flows from the femoral artery via the AV-shunt into the femoral vein. The exposure of flowing blood to a silk thread induces the formation of a significant thrombus. Forty minutes later, the shunt is disconnected and the silk thread covered with thrombus is weighed. Test agents or vehicle will be given (i.v., i.p., s.c, or orally) prior to the opening of the AV shunt. The percentage inhibition of thrombus formation is determined for each treatment group. The ID50 values (dose that produces 50% inhibition of thrombus formation) are estimated by a nonlinear least square regression program using the Hill sigmoid Emax equation (DeltaGraph; SPSS Inc., Chicago, EL).<br>
 [00171]	The anti-inflammatory effect of these compounds can be demonstrated<br>
in an Evans Blue dye extravasation assay using C1-esterase inhibitor deficient mice. In this model, mice are dosed with a compound of the present invention, Evans Blue dye is injected via the tail vein, and extravasation of the blue dye is determined by spectrophotometric means from tissue extracts.<br>
[00172]	The ability of the compounds of the current invention to reduce or<br>
prevent the systemic inflammatory response syndrome, for example, as observed during on-pump cardiovascular procedures, can be tested in in vitro perfusion systems, or by on-pump surgical procedures in larger mammals, including dogs and baboons. Read-outs to assess the benefit of the compounds of the present invention include for example reduced platelet loss, reduced platelet / white blood cell complexes, reduced neutrophil elastase levels in plasma, reduced activation of complement factors, and reduced activation and/or consumption of contact activation proteins (plasma kallikrein, factor XII, factor XI, high molecular weight kininogen, C1-esterase inhibitors).<br>
[00173]	The compounds of the present invention may also be useful as<br>
inhibitors of additional serine proteases, notably human thrombin, human plasma kallikrein and human plasmin. Because of their inhibitory action, these compounds are indicated for use in the prevention or treatment of physiological reactions, including blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, blood pressure regulation and inflammation, and wound healing catalyzed by the aforesaid class of enzymes. Specifically, the compounds have utility as drugs for the treatment of diseases arising from elevated thrombin activity of the aforementioned serine proteases, such as myocardial infarction, and as reagents used as anticoagulants in the processing of blood to plasma for diagnostic and other commercial purposes.<br>
V. PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS, FORMULATIONS AND<br>
COMBINATIONS<br>
[00174]	The compounds of this invention can be administered in such oral<br>
dosage forms as tablets, capsules (each of which includes sustained release or timed<br>
release formulations), pills, powders, granules, elixirs, tinctures, suspensions, syrups,<br>
and emulsions. They may also be administered in intravenous (bolus or infusion),<br>
intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, or intramuscular form, all using dosage forms well<br>
known to those of ordinary skill in the pharmaceutical arts. They can be administered<br>
alone, but generally will be administered with a pharmaceutical carrier selected on the<br>
basis of the chosen route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice.<br>
[00175]	The term "pharmaceutical composition" means a composition<br>
comprising a compound of the invention in combination with at least one additional pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. A "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" refers to media generally accepted in the art for the delivery of biologically active agents to animals, in particular, mammals, including, i.e., adjuvant, excipient or vehicle, such as diluents, preserving agents, fillers, flow regulating agents, disintegrating agents, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, suspending agents, sweetening agents, flavoring agents, perfuming agents, antibacterial agents, antifungal agents, lubricating agents and dispensing agents, depending on the nature of the mode of administration and dosage forms. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are formulated according to a number of factors well within the purview of those of ordinary skill in the art. These include, without limitation: the type and nature of the active agent being formulated; the subject to which the agent-containing composition is to be administered; the intended route of administration of the composition; and the therapeutic indication being targeted. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include both aqueous and nonaqueous liquid media, as well as a variety of solid and semi-solid dosage forms. Such carriers can include a number of different ingredients and additives in addition to the active agent, such additional ingredients being included in the formulation for a variety of reasons, e.g., stabilization of the active agent, binders, etc., well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Descriptions of suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, and factors involved in their selection, are found in a variety of readily available sources such as, for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18 Edition, 1990.<br>
[00176]	The dosage regimen for the compounds of the present invention will,<br>
of course, vary depending upon known factors, such as the pharmacodynamic characteristics of the particular agent and its mode and route of administration; the species, age, sex, health, medical condition, and weight of the recipient; the nature<br>
and extent of the symptoms; the kind of concurrent treatment; the frequency of treatment; the route of administration, the renal and hepatic function of the patient, and the effect desired. A physician or veterinarian can determine and prescribe the effective amount of the drug required to prevent, counter, or arrest the progress of the thromboembolic disorder.<br>
[00177]	By way of general guidance, the daily oral dosage of each active<br>
ingredient, when used for the indicated effects, will range between about 0.001 to<br>
about 1000 mg/kg of body weight, preferably between about 0.01 to about 100 mg/kg<br>
of body weight per day, and most preferably between about 0.1 to about 20<br>
mg/kg/day. Intravenously, the most preferred doses will range from about 0.001 to<br>
about 10 mg/kg/minute during a constant rate infusion. Compounds of this invention<br>
may be administered in a single daily dose, or the total daily dosage may be<br>
administered in divided doses of two, three, or four times daily.<br>
[00178]	Compounds of this invention can also be administered by parenteral<br>
administration (e.g., intra-venous, intra-arterial, intra-musculary, or sub-cutaneously. When administered intra-venous or intra-arterial, the dose can be given continuously or intermittend. Furthermore, formulation can be developed for intramusculary and subcutaneous delivery that ensure a gradual release of the active pharmaceutical ingredient.<br>
[00179]	Compounds of this invention can be administered in intranasal form<br>
via topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles, or via transdermal routes, using transdermal skin patches. When administered in the form of a transdermal delivery system, the dosage administration will, of course, be continuous rather than intermittent throughout the dosage regimen.<br>
[00180]	The compounds are typically administered in admixture with suitable<br>
pharmaceutical diluents, excipients, or carriers (collectively referred to herein as pharmaceutical carriers) suitably selected with respect to the intended form of administration, e.g., oral tablets, capsules, elixirs, and syrups, and consistent with conventional pharmaceutical practices.<br>
[00181]	For instance, for oral administration in the form of a tablet or capsule,<br>
the active drug component can be combined with an oral, non-toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable, inert carrier such as lactose, starch, sucrose, glucose,<br>
methyl callulose, magnesium stearate, dicalcium phosphate, calcium sulfate,<br>
mannitol, sorbitol and the like; for oral administration in liquid form, the oral drug<br>
components can be combined with any oral, non-toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
inert carrier such as ethanol, glycerol, water, and the like. Moreover, when desired<br>
or necessary, suitable binders, lubricants, disintegrating agents, and coloring agents<br>
can also be incorporated into the mixture. Suitable binders include starch, gelatin,<br>
natural sugars such as glucose or beta-lactose, corn sweeteners, natural and synthetic<br>
gums such as acacia, tragacanth, or sodium alginate, carboxymethylcellulose,<br>
polyethylene glycol, waxes, and the like. Lubricants used in these dosage forms<br>
include sodium oleate, sodium stearate, magnesium stearate, sodium benzoate,<br>
sodium acetate, sodium chloride, and the like. Disintegrators include, without<br>
limitation, starch, methyl cellulose, agar, bentonite, xanthan gum, and the like.<br>
[00182]	The compounds of the present invention can also be administered in<br>
the form of liposome delivery systems, such as small unilamellar vesicles, large<br>
unilamellar vesicles, and multilamellar vesicles. Liposomes can be formed from a<br>
variety of phospholipids, such as cholesterol, stearylamine, or phosphatidylcholines.<br>
[00183]	Compounds of the present invention may also be coupled with soluble<br>
polymers as targetable drug carriers. Such polymers can include polyvinylpyrrolidone, pyran copolymer, polyhydroxypropylmethacrylamide-phenol, polyhydroxyethylaspartamidephenol, or polyethyleneoxide-polylysine substituted with palmitoyl residues. Furthermore, the compounds of the present invention may be coupled to a class of biodegradable polymers useful in achieving controlled release of a drug, for example, poly lactic acid, poly gly colic acid, copolymers of polylactic and polyglycolic acid, polyepsilon caprolactone, polyhydroxy butyric acid, polyorthoesters, polyacetals, polydihydropyrans, polycyanoacylates, and crosslinked or amphipathic block copolymers of hydrogels.<br>
[00184]	Dosage forms (pharmaceutical compositions) suitable for<br>
administration may contain from about 1 milligram to about 1000 milligrams of active ingredient per dosage unit. In these pharmaceutical compositions the active ingredient will ordinarily be present in an amount of about 0.1-95% by weight based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
 [00185]	Gelatin capsules may contain the active ingredient and powdered<br>
carriers, such as lactose, starch, cellulose derivatives, magnesium stearate, stearic acid, and the like. Similar diluents can be used to make compressed tablets. Both tablets and capsules can be manufactured as sustained release products to provide for continuous release of medication over a period of hours. Compressed tablets can be sugar coated or film coated to mask any unpleasant taste and protect the tablet from the atmosphere, or enteric coated for selective disintegration in the gastrointestinal tract.<br>
[00186]	Liquid dosage forms for oral administration can contain coloring and<br>
flavoring to increase patient acceptance.<br>
[00187]	In general, water, a suitable oil, saline, aqueous dextrose (glucose), and<br>
related sugar solutions and glycols such as propylene glycol or polyethylene glycols<br>
are suitable carriers for parenteral solutions. Solutions for parenteral administration<br>
preferably contain a water soluble salt of the active ingredient, suitable stabilizing<br>
agents, and if necessary, buffer substances. Antioxidizing agents such as sodium<br>
bisulfite, sodium sulfite, or ascorbic acid, either alone or combined, are suitable<br>
stabilizing agents. Also used are citric acid and its salts and sodium EDTA. In<br>
addition, parenteral solutions can contain preservatives, such as benzalkonium<br>
chloride, methyl-or propyl-paraben, and chlorobutanol.<br>
[00188]	Suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in Remington's<br>
Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, a standard reference text in this field.<br>
[00189]	Where the compounds of this invention are combined with other<br>
anticoagulant agents, for example, a daily dosage may be about 0.1 to about 100 milligrams of the compound of the present invention and about 0.1 to about 100 milligrams per kilogram of patient body weight. For a tablet dosage form, the compounds of this invention generally may be present in an amount of about 5 to about 100 milligrams per dosage unit, and the second anti-coagulant in an amount of about 1 to about 50 milligrams per dosage unit.<br>
[00190]	Where the compounds of the present invention are administered in<br>
combination with an anti-platelet agent, by way of general guidance, typically a daily dosage may be about 0.01 to about 25 milligrams of the compound of the present<br>
invention and about 50 to about 150 milligrams of the anti-platelet agent, preferably<br>
about 0.1 to about 1 milligrams of the compound of the present invention and about 1<br>
to about 3 milligrams of antiplatelet agents, per kilogram of patient body weight.<br>
[00191]	Where the compounds of the present invention are administered in<br>
combination with thrombolytic agent, typically a daily dosage may be about 0.1 to about 1 milligrams of the compound of the present invention, per kilogram of patient body weight and, in the case of the thrombolytic agents, the usual dosage of the thrombolyic agent when administered alone may be reduced by about 50-80% when administered with a compound of the present invention.<br>
[00192]	Particularly when provided as a single dosage unit, the potential exists<br>
for a chemical interaction between the combined active ingredients. For this reason,<br>
when the compound of the present invention and a second therapeutic agent are<br>
combined in a single dosage unit they are formulated such that although the active<br>
ingredients are combined in a single dosage unit, the physical contact between the<br>
active ingredients is minimized (that is, reduced). For example, one active ingredient<br>
may be enteric coated. By enteric coating one of the active ingredients, it is possible<br>
not only to minimize the contact between the combined active ingredients, but also, it<br>
is possible to control the release of one of these components in the gastrointestinal<br>
tract such that one of these components is not released in the stomach but rather is<br>
released in the intestines. One of the active ingredients may also be coated with a<br>
material that affects a sustained-release throughout the gastrointestinal tract and also<br>
serves to minimize physical contact between the combined active ingredients.<br>
Furthermore, the sustained-released component can be additionally enteric coated<br>
such that the release of this component occurs only in the intestine. Still another<br>
approach would involve the formulation of a combination product in which the one<br>
component is coated with a sustained and/or enteric release polymer, and the other<br>
component is also coated with a polymer such as a low viscosity grade of<br>
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) or other appropriate materials as known in<br>
the art, in order to further separate the active components. The polymer coating<br>
serves to form an additional barrier to interaction with the other component.<br>
[00193]	These as well as other ways of minimizing contact between the<br>
components of combination products of the present invention, whether administered<br>
in a single dosage form or administered in separate forms but at the same time by the same manner, will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, once armed with the present disclosure.<br>

[00199]	In another embodiment, the present invention provides a<br>
pharmaceutical composition, wherein the additional therapeutic agent is the antiplatelet agent clopidogrel.<br>
[00200]	The compounds of the present invention can be administered alone or<br>
in combination with one or more additional therapeutic agents. By "administered in combination" or "combination therapy" it is meant that the compound of the present invention and one or more additional therapeutic agents are administered concurrently to the mammal being treated. When administered in combination, each component may be administered at the same time or sequentially in any order at different points in time. Thus, each component may be administered separately but sufficiently closely in time so as to provide the desired therapeutic effect.<br>
 [00201]	Compounds that can be administered in combination with the<br>
compounds of the present invention include, but are not limited to, anticoagulants, anti-thrombin agents, anti-platelet agents, fibrinolytics, hypolipidemic agents, antihypertensive agents, and anti-ischemic agents.<br>
[00202]	Other anticoagulant agents (or coagulation inhibitory agents) that may<br>
be used in combination with the compounds of this invention include warfarin, heparin (either unfractionated heparin or any commercially available low molecular weight heparin, for example LOVENOX™), synthetic pentasaccharide, direct acting thrombin inhibitors including hirudin and argatroban, as well as other factor VIIa inhibitors, factor IXa inhibitors, factor Xa inhibitors (e.g., Arixtra™, apixaban, rivaroxaban, LY-517717, DU-176b, DX-9065a, and those disclosed in WO 98/57951, WO 03/026652, WO 01/047919, and WO 00/076970), factor XIa inhibitors, and inhibitors of activated TAFI and PAI-1 known in the art.<br>
[00203]	The term anti-platelet agents (or platelet inhibitory agents), as used<br>
herein, denotes agents that inhibit platelet function, for example, by inhibiting the<br>
aggregation, adhesion or granule-content secretion of platelets. Such agents include,<br>
but are not limited to, the various known non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs<br>
(NSAIDS) such as acetaminophen, aspirin, codeine, diclofenac, droxicam, fentaynl,<br>

piroxicam, sufentanyl, sulfinpyrazone, sulindac, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts<br>
or prodrugs thereof. Of the NSAIDS, aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid or ASA) and<br>
piroxicam are preferred. Other suitable platelet inhibitory agents include glycoprotein<br>
IIb/IIIa antagonists (e.g., tirofiban, eptifibatide, abciximab, and integrelin),<br>
thromboxane-A2-receptor antagonists (e.g., ifetroban), thromboxane-A-synthetase<br>

receptor antagonists include clopidogrel, ticlopidine, prasugrel, and AZD-6140, cangrelor, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts or prodrugs thereof. Ticlopidine and clopidogrel are also preferred compounds since they are known to be more gentle than aspirin on the gastro-intestinal tract in use. Clopidogrel is an even more preferred agent.<br>
[00205]	A preferred example is a triple combination of a compound of the<br>
present invention, aspirin, and another anti-platelet agent.   Preferably, the anti<br>
platelet agent is clopidogrel or prasugrel, more preferably clopidogrel.<br>
[00206]	The term thrombin inhibitors (or anti-thrombin agents), as used herein,<br>
denotes inhibitors of the serine protease thrombin. By inhibiting thrombin, various thrombin-mediated processes, such as thrombin-mediated platelet activation (that is, for example, the aggregation of platelets, and/or the secretion of platelet granule contents including serotonin) and/or fibrin formation are disrupted. A number of thrombin inhibitors are known to one of skill in the art and these inhibitors are contemplated to be used in combination with the present compounds. Such inhibitors include, but are not limited to, boroarginine derivatives, boropeptides, heparins, hirudin, argatroban, dabigatran, AZD-0837, and those disclosed in WO 98/37075 and WO 02/044145, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and prodrugs thereof.

[00207]	The term thrombolytic (or fibrinolytic) agents (or thrombolytics or<br>
fibrinolytics), as used herein, denotes agents that lyse blood clots (thrombi). Such agents include tissue plasminogen activator (TPA, natural or recombinant) and modified forms thereof, anistreplase, urokinase, streptokinase, tenecteplase (TNK), lanoteplase (nPA), factor VIIa inhibitors, thrombin inhibitors, inhibitors of factors IXa, Xa, and XIa, PAI-I inhibitors (i.e., inactivators of tissue plasminogen activator inhibitors), inhibitors of activated TAFI, alpha-2-antiplasmin inhibitors, and anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex, including pharmaceutically acceptable salts or prodrugs thereof. The term anistreplase, as used herein, refers to<br>
anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex, as described, for example, in European Patent Application No. 028,489, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference herein. The term urokinase, as used herein, is intended to denote both dual and single chain urokinase, the latter also being referred to herein as prourokinase.<br>
