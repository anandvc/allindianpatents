Related Application<br>
The present application is a Continuation-In-Part ofD.S. Patent Application Serial No.<br>
10/885,810, filed July 7,2004, the complete disclosure ofwhich is hereby expressly incorporated<br>
by reference.<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to piston designs for internal combustion engines. More<br>
specifically, the present invention is directed to one-piece steel piston designs and methods of<br>
making the same.<br>
Background Art<br>
Internal combustion engine pistons are exposed to extremely tough working<br>
environments. They are subjected to high temperatures, explosive firing pressures, side forces<br>
and inertial forces. As an engine's output is increased more and more, temperatures, cylinder<br>
pressures and engine speed can become so high that traditional materials from which pistons are<br>
made, including aluminum alloys, reach their fatigue strengths.<br>
Articulated pistons are two-piece pistons that have a crown made of steel and a skirt<br>
made from aluminum. The crown and skirt are joined together by means of a piston pin. In<br>
articulated pistons, the crown and skirt are able to articulate so as to move independently of each<br>
other.<br>
Articulated pistons provide several advantages over one-piece cast aluminum pistons.<br>
For example, the steel crown in articulated pistons has a thermal expansion rate that is more<br>
similar to the thermal expansion rate of iron piston liners than aluminum. In addition, heat from<br>
the steel crowns of articulated pistons is not as easily transferred to the aluminum skirt so the<br>
skirt retains its shape better. Further, piston secondary motion in articulated pistons can be better<br>
than in one-piece pistons.<br>
Although articulated pistons can withstand relatively higher pressures and temperatures,<br>
there are some practical design limitations associated with articulated pistons. For example,<br>
articulated pistons require longer piston pins, making the total piston assembly (piston plus<br>
piston pin) generally heavier than one-piece aluminum piston assemblies. In addition, since the<br>
piston crown and skirt move independently of each other, the skirt cannot effectively function to<br>
guide movement of the piston crown. Accordingly, the piston land has to guide movement of the<br>
piston crown. This results in land-to-cylinder liner contact which can cause cavitation problems.<br>
Another design limitation associated with articulated pistons is that there is no connection<br>
between the ring belt and skirt. This allows stresses to be very high in the cooling gallery and on<br>
the bowl edge which can cause cracks to occur. Moreover, the lack of connection between the<br>
ring belt and skirt and resulting stresses allow for ring groove deformations to be very high<br>
which can cause oil consumption, blow-by, and emission problems.<br>
Piston designers have been trying very hard to come up with new technologies to<br>
overcome the problems associated with articulated pistons. A number of proposed solutions<br>
have focused on one-piece steel pistons. Unlike articulated pistons, the skirt and crown of onepiece<br>
steel pistons fonn an integrated unit with the piston crown having a cooling gallery.<br>
Examples of patented one-piece steel pistons are found in DE 44 46 726 Al to Kemnitz, U.S.<br>
Patent No. 6,223,701 to Kruse, EP 0 992 670 Al to Gaiser et aI., and International Application<br>
Publication No. WO 01150042 to Gaiser et a1.<br>
One of the most challenging aspects of one-piece piston designs is creating a cooling<br>
gallery in the piston crown while ~t the same time ensuring sufficient margins for fatigue<br>
strength and minimizing ring groove deformations subject to loads. In DE 44 46 726 Al the<br>
piston is not connected between ring belt and skirt. Therefore, the overall structure of the piston<br>
is not stable and high stress can cause defonnation to occur in the piston crown. In addition,<br>
because the skirt ofthe piston is short in DE 44 46 726 AI, high contact pressures will be created<br>
between the skirt and cylinder liner. Moreover, the shortness of the skirt used in DE 44 46 726<br>
A1 limits the ability ofthe skirt to guide the movement of the piston so that cavitation can occur<br>
with respect to the cylinder liner. Overall, the process of manufacturing the one-piece piston of<br>
DE 44 46 726 A1 is very intensive.<br>
In WOOl/50042 Al upper and lower crown sections are joined by a friction weld. The<br>
friction welding used in this piston design changes the original material properties. Moreover,<br>
cracks can occur in the welding area either during welding or during subsequent heat treatment<br>
or operational heating. In addition, because welding flashes in a cooling gallery cannot be<br>
removed they will reduce the effective cooling gallery volume and could, in a worst case<br>
scenario, block the cooling gallery completely. Further, as a result of friction welding, metal<br>
particles remaining in the cooling gallery could damage an engine if they are released from the<br>
cooling gallery while the engine is running.<br>
The present invention is directed to one-piece steel pistons that are made from piston<br>
blanks that are provided with at least one portion that is configured and designed to be displaced<br>
to form a cooling gallery and ring belt.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention<br>
The present invention is directed to one-piece steel pistons for internal combustion<br>
engines. The one-piece steel pistons of the present invention are formed from single unitary steel<br>
forged or cast parts which are subsequently subjected to machining and metal working processes.<br>
The one-piece steel pistons include cooling galleries which may be partially fonned during the<br>
forging or casting process and which are otherwise completely fonned after the subsequent<br>
machining and metal working. The pre-machined, pre-metal-worked forged or cast parts are<br>
referred to herein as "piston blanks." According to the present invention the piston blanks each<br>
include at least one portion that is configured to be displaced during metal working so as to<br>
define the final structure of the one-piece pistons. The forged or cast parts from which the onepiece<br>
steel pistons are produced can also be provided with and/or machined to have abutment<br>
portions which assist in properly positioning the displaced portions as they are displaced. The<br>
displaced portions can be welded to, or configured to mechanically interlock with, an adjacent<br>
portion of the piston.<br>
The process ofmanufacturing the one-piece steel pistons of the present invention<br>
involves forging or casting a pre-machined and pre-metal worked piston or piston blank that<br>
includes a top portion, a skirt, a pair of opposed pin bosses, and one or more flanges that extend<br>
radially outward from the top and/or a side portion of the piston blank. Optionally, the premachined<br>
and pre-metal-worked piston blank can be forged or cast with a rough (pre-finished)<br>
crown bowl and/or a rough (pre-finished) cooling gallery and/or rough (pre-finished) pin bores.<br>
In the next step the cooling gallery is provided or finished by a machining step and an annular<br>
abutment (when used) is fonned at an appropriate location to assist in properly positioning the<br>
displaced portions as they are displaced. Next, the flange(s) is/are bent or folded downward<br>
-7-<br>
and/or upward so that the peripheral edge of the flange(s) abutments an adjacent portion of the<br>
piston. Prior to bending or folding the flange(s), the flange(s) is/are machined so that the<br>
peripheral edge ofthe flange(s) is/are dimensioned and configured to cooperate with an adjacent<br>
portion of the piston to either mechanically engage or to be welded to the adjacent portion ofthe<br>
piston. After the flange(s) is/are bent or folded into position, grooves for compression rings and<br>
an oil ring are formed in a portion ofthe flange(s) that defines the ring belt in the finished piston.<br>
At any convenient time during the above steps, the pin bores may be provided and/or finished<br>
and the under crown area can be machined out as desired to reduce overall weight.<br>
The one-piece steel pistons of the present invention can be made from any suitable steel<br>
material that can be worked as described herein and that is capable of withstanding the high<br>
combustion pressures, high piston speeds, high temperatures and mechanical stresses that are<br>
common in the environment of internal combustion engines. Various known types ofcarbon<br>
steel materials are suitable for purposes of the present invention. The piston blank can be made<br>
by a forging or casting process.<br>
Reference will hereafter be made to the attached drawings in which common reference<br>
numbers are used throughout the various figures to identify similar elements when possible.<br>
Figure 1 is a compound cross-sectional view through the pin bore (right hand side) and<br>
along the thrust axis (left hand side) of a piston according to one embodiment of the present<br>
invention shown in half section before the T-form flange is worked into its final position. The<br>
piston depicted in Fig. 1 is a steel piston blank that includes a piston skirt 1 opposed pin bosses 2<br>
and a piston head 3. A flange 4 extends radially outward from the central portion ofthe piston<br>
head 3 near the top. As indicted in Fig. 1, the diameter, DT, of flange 4 is greater than the<br>
diameter, OK, of the skirt 1. The diameter, DT, of the flange 4 is greater than the diameter, DK,<br>
of the skirt 1 by an amount that is equal to or greater than the difference in height between the<br>
top ofthe piston and the top 5 ofthe skirt 1. The flange 4 is referred to herein as a T-fold flange<br>
due to its cross-sectional shape in relationship to the piston head 3 and the manner in which the<br>
flange 4 is folded or bent by machining as discussed in detail below to fonn the final one-piece<br>
steel piston.<br>
As indicated in broken lines, the piston head 3 can be forged or cast with a crown shape 7<br>
or otherwise fanned to have a flat top 8. In addition, as indicated in broken lines, a cooling<br>
gallery 9 can be partially or completely formed in the forged or cast piston blank. It is also<br>
possible to form rough pin holesiO during the forging or casting of the piston as indicated in<br>
broken lines in Fig. 1. Although the design of the one-piece steel piston of the present invention<br>
is novel, the steel forged or cast piston blank depicted in Fig. 1 can be made using conventional<br>
forging or casting techniques that are well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
An alternative to forming a crown shape 7 in the forged or cast piston blank and/or<br>
forming a cooling gallery 9 in the forged or cast piston blank and/or forming a pin bore 10 in the<br>
forged or cast piston blank would be to machine one or more of these features in the forged or<br>
cast piston blank. However, forming these features in the forged or cast piston blank would<br>
reduce machining and material costs.<br>
Figure 2 is a compound cross-sectional view of a piston according to Fig. 1 shown in half<br>
section with the cooling gallery machined to include a stop-log on the top of the piston skirt. In<br>
the embodiment ofthe piston depicted in Fig. 2 the cooling gallery 9 has been machined to a<br>
finished state in the piston. In addition, an abutment II has been formed on the top 5 of the skirt<br>
1. The abutment 11 also referred to as a stop-log has an annular shape that extends<br>
circumferentially within the cooling gallery 9 along the top 5 of the skirt 1.<br>
necessary gap between the peripheral edge 12 of the flange 4 and the top 5 ofthe skirt 1 and,<br>
after welding, finishing the weld bead so that the seam 15 is smooth. It is noted that the weld<br>
seam 15 can be configured so that it does not extend into the cooling gallery 9. Accordingly,<br>
there is no apprehension that flashing from the welding process will obstruct the cooling gallery<br>
9 or that the welding process will deposit metal particles in the cooling gallery 9 which could be<br>
released during operating of an engine containing the piston.<br>
Figure 5 is a sectional view depicting one manner in which the flange can be<br>
mechanically coupled to the top of the piston skirt according to one embodiment of the present<br>
invention. In the embodiment of the invention depicted in Fig. 5, the top 5 ofthe skirt 1 is<br>
provided with an annular recess 16 and the peripheral edge 12 ofthe flange 4 is provided with an<br>
annular projection 17 that is configured to be received in the recess 16. The recess 16 and<br>
projection 17 on the flange 4 are depicted as having circular cross-sectional shapes wherein the<br>
narrowest portion of the opening ofthe recess 16 is less than the diameter of the recess 16 so that<br>
the projection 17 can be press-fit into the recess and secured therein. In alternative embodiments<br>
ofthe present invention the mechanical coupling of the flange 4 to the top 5 of the skirt 1 can be<br>
achieved using any cooperating, engaging structures which prevent the flange 4 from separating<br>
from the top 5 ofthe skirt 1, including one or more recesses/projections having various<br>
configurations.<br>
Figure 6 is a sectional view depicting one manner in which the flange can be<br>
mechanically coupled to the top of the piston skirt according to another embodiment of the<br>
present invention. In the embodiment ofthe invention depicted in Fig. 6 the peripheral edge 12<br>
ofthe flange 4 is provided with alterative projections 18 and recesses 19 that engage and<br>
interlock with complementarily shaped recesses 20 and projections 21 fonned on the top 5 of the<br>
Figure 3 is a compound cross-sectional view of a piston according to Fig 1 shown in half<br>
section with the T-fonn flange positioned into its final position. In Fig. 3 the flange 4 has been<br>
bent or folded from its position depicted in Figs. I and 2 to a position in which the flange 4<br>
closes cooling gallery 9. As shown in Fig. 3, the outer peripheral edge 12 of the flange 4 shown<br>
in Figs. 1 and 2 has been displaced by bending or folding the flange 4 so that the peripheral edge<br>
12 contacts abutment 11 and rests on top 5 of the skirt 1.<br>
From Fig. 3 it can be seen that the flange 4 is configured, e.g. forged or cast and/or<br>
machined, so that when the peripheral edge 12 0 f the flange 4 contacts abutment 11, the annular<br>
side surface 13 of the flange 4 (fonnerly top surface) is substantially in alignment with the<br>
annular side surface 14 ofthe skirt 1 so that the overall outer annular surface of the final piston is<br>
substantially continuous. The peripheral edge 12 of the flange 4 has also been machined in Fig.<br>
3 so as to conform to the configuration of the abutment I I .<br>
The flange 4 can be bent or folded from its forged position depicted in Fig. 1 to its<br>
position depicted in Fig. 3 by bending the flange 4 downwards towards the skirt 1 while spinning<br>
the piston about its central axis. During the bending process the flange 4 can be heated. In<br>
addition, the bending of the flange 4 can be perfonned in one or more steps. It is also possible to<br>
bend the flange 4 toward the skirt 1 using one or more bending forms or any other conventional<br>
metal fonning processes/apparatus.<br>
Figure 4 is a sectional view depicting one manner in which the flange is welded to the top<br>
of the piston skirt according to one embodiment of the present invention. In Fig. 4 the peripheral<br>
edge 12 ofthe flange 4 is welded to the top 5 of the skirt 1 using a conventional welding<br>
technique. Figure 4 depicts the weld seam 15 as being substantially flush with the outer annular<br>
surfaces ofthe flange 4 and the skirt 1. Such a configuration can be achieved by providing any<br>
skirt 1. From Figs 5 and 6 it can be understood that the mechahical coupling ofthe flange 4 to<br>
the top 5 of the skirt 1 can be achieved using any cooperating, engaging structures which prevent<br>
the flange 4 from separating from the top 5 ofthe skirt 1 and that the invention is not limited to<br>
the mechanical coupling structures depicted in Figs. 5 and 6.<br>
Figure 7 is a compound cross-sectional view ofa piston according to one embodiment of<br>
the present invention shown in half section with ring grooves formed in the flange. Figure 7<br>
depicts a finished piston that includes a bowl shaped crown 7 and a pair of opposed pin bosses 2<br>
with finished pin bores 10 therein (one shown) and snap ring grooves 23 (one shown). Figure 7<br>
also depicts an oil injection port 24 provided in the bottom ofcooling gallery 9 into which oil can<br>
be injected for cooling the cooling gallery 9 according to known methods. In the piston shown<br>
in Fig. 7 the under crown area 25 has been machined away to reduce overall weight of the piston.<br>
In one of the final manufacturing steps, the ring belt 26 (defined by the flange 4) of the<br>
piston will be provided with grooves 27 for receiving piston rings including one or more<br>
compression rings and an oil ring in a known manner.<br>
As can be appreciated, the final piston (shown in Fig. 7) is a one-piece steel piston having<br>
an internal cooling gallery and a crown and skirt that are formed as an integrated unit. The onepiece<br>
steel piston of the present invention is made without the use offriction welding and<br>
therefore avoids problems and concerns associated with friction welding.<br>
The process of manufacturing the one-piece steel pistons ofthe present invention<br>
involves forging or casting a pre-machined and pre-metal worked piston or piston blank as<br>
shown in Fig.! that includes a top, a skirt 1, a pair of opposed pin bosses 2 and a flange 4 that<br>
extends radially outward from the top. Optionally, the pre-machined and pre-metal worked<br>
forged or cast piston or piston blank can be forged or cast with a rough (pre-machined) crown<br>
bowl 7 and/or a rough (pre-machined) cooling gallery 9.<br>
In the next step the cooling gallery 9 is provided or otherwise finished by a machining<br>
step and an annular abutment 11 is formed at the top 5 ofthe skirt 1 as shown in Fig. 2.<br>
Next, the flange 4 is bent or folded downward so that the peripheral edge 12 of the flange<br>
4 contacts abutment 11 and rests on the top 5 of the skirt 1 as shown in Fig. 3. Prior to bending<br>
or folding the flange 4 the flange 4 is machined so that the peripheral edge 12 cooperates with<br>
the abutment l1and is either welded to the top 5 ofthe skirt 1 or mechanically engages the top 5<br>
portion of the skirt 1. In addition, the flange 5 is machined so as to have an outer annular surface<br>
after bending or folding that is substantially flush with the annular outer surface ofthe skirt 1<br>
which has also been machined to a finished state. The machining of the annular surfaces of the<br>
skirt 1 and flange 4 can be conducted after the flange 4 is bent or folded.<br>
After the flange 4 is bent or folded grooves 27 for compression rings and an oil ring are<br>
formed in a portion of the flange 4 that defines the ring belt 26.<br>
At any convenient time during the above steps, the pin bore can be provided and/or<br>
finished and the under crown area can be machined out as desired to reduce overall weight.<br>
Figures 1-3 and 7 are directed to embodiments of the present invention in which a flange<br>
4 is provided near the top of the piston blank and subsequently bent or folded downward to close<br>
cooling gallery 9.<br>
In further embodiments of the present invention the piston blank can be provided with a<br>
flange that is bent or folded upward to close a cooling gallery or flanges that are bent or folded<br>
downwards and upwards together to close a cooling gallery. In addition to closing the cooling<br>
galleries, the flanges could be configured to, after being bent or folded and machined, define<br>
portions ofthe sides or tops ofthe pistons.<br>
Figure 8 is a compound cross-sectional view through the pin bore (right hand side) and<br>
along the thrust axis (left hand side) of a piston according to another embodiment ofthe present<br>
invention shown in half section before a flange formed on the piston is worked into its final<br>
position.<br>
The piston depicted in Fig. 8 is a steel piston blank that includes a piston skirt I opposed<br>
pin bosses 2 and a piston head 3. A flange 4' extends radially outward from the central portion<br>
of the piston head 3 from a location that is midway between the top ofthe piston and the top of<br>
the piston skirt 1. The diameter of flange 4' is greater than the diameter of the skirt 1 by an<br>
amount that is sufficient to, after any necessary machining, close the cooling gallery as shown in<br>
Fig. 10. In the embodiment of the invention depicted in Figs. 8-10, the flange 4' is configured to<br>
be bent or folded under an edge 28 of the top of the piston which is depicted in Fig. 9.<br>
As indicated in broken lines, the piston head 3 can be forged or cast with a recessed shape<br>
7' or otherwise formed to have a flat top 8. In addition, as indicated in broken lines, a cooling<br>
gallery 9 can be partially or completely formed in the forged or cast piston. It is also possible to<br>
form rough pin holes 10 during the forging or casting of the piston as indicated in broken lines in<br>
Fig. 8. The steel forged or cast piston blank depicted in Fig. 8 can be made using conventional<br>
forging or casting techniques that are well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
An alternative to forming a crown shape 7' in the forged or cast piston blank and/or<br>
forming a cooling gallery 9 in the forged or cast piston blank and/or forming a pin bore lOin the<br>
forged or cast piston blank would be to machine one or more of these features in the forged or<br>
cast piston blank. However, fonning these features in the forged or cast piston blank would<br>
reduce machining and material costs.<br>
Figure 9 is a compound cross-sectional view of a piston according to Fig. 8 shown in half<br>
section with a cooling gallery machined into the piston. In the embodiment ofthe piston<br>
depicted in Fig. 9, the cooling gallery 9 has been machined to a finished state in the piston. In<br>
addition, an abutment similar to that shown in Fig. 2 can be fonned on under edge 28 near the<br>
top of the piston if desired. If an abutment is used in this embodiment ofthe present invention it<br>
should have an annular shape that extends circumferentially within the cooling gallery 9 beneath<br>
the edge 28 as depicted. It is to be understood that while the abutment structures discussed<br>
herein are useful in assisting in the proper positioning and alignment of the flanges when they are<br>
displaced, it is possible to eliminate the abutments as long as more care is taken to bend of fold<br>
the flanges into their correct portions.<br>
Figure lOis a compound cross-sectional view ofa piston according to Fig. 9 shown in<br>
half section with the flange positioned into its final position. In Fig. 10 the flange 4 has been<br>
bent or folded from its position depicted in Figs. 8 and 9 to a position in which the flange 4'<br>
closes cooling gallery 9. As shown in Fig. 10, the outer peripheral edge 12' ofthe flange 4'<br>
shown in Figs. 8 and 9 has been displaced by bending or folding the flange 4' so that the<br>
peripheral edge 12' is beneath edge 28.<br>
From Fig. 10 it can be seen that the flange 4' is configured, e.g. forged or cast and/or<br>
machined, so that when the peripheral edge 12' of the flange 4' contacts abutment 11, the<br>
annular side surface 13' of the flange 4 (fonnerly bottom surface) is substantially in alignment<br>
with the annular side surface 14 of the skirt 1 so that the overall outer annular surface of the final<br>
piston is substantially continuous. The peripheral edge 12' ofthe flange 4' has also been<br>
machined in Fig. 10 so as to conform to the configuration of the abutment 11.<br>
The flange 4' can be bent or folded from its forged position depicted in Fig. 8 to its<br>
position depicted in Fig. 10 by bending the flange 4' upwards while spinning the piston about its<br>
central axis. During the bending process the flange 4' can be heated. In addition, the bending of<br>
the flange 4' can be performed in one or more steps. It is also possible to bend the flange 4'<br>
upward using one or more bending forms or any other conventional metal forming<br>
process/apparatus.<br>
The peripheral edge 12' of the flange 4' can be welded to the lower surface of edge 28<br>
according to one embodiment of the present invention using conventional welding techniques.<br>
In such a case the resulting weld seam should be substantially flush with the outer annular<br>
surfaces of the flange 4' and the edge 28. Such a configuration can be achieved by providing<br>
any necessary gap between the peripheral edge 12' of the flange 4' and the lower surface of edge<br>
and, after welding, finishing the weld bead so that the seam is smooth. It is noted that the weld<br>
seam can be configured so that it does not extend into the cooling gallery 9. Accordingly, there<br>
is no apprehension that flashing from the welding process will obstruct the cooling gallery 9 or<br>
that the welding process will deposit metal particles in the cooling gallery 9 which could be<br>
released during operating of an engine containing the piston.<br>
As an alternative to welding peripheral edge 12' of the flange 4' flange to the lower<br>
surface of edge 28 the opposing structures can be configured to mechanically interlock using<br>
structural configurations similar to those exemplified and discussed in reference to Figs. 5 and 6<br>
above. It is understood that the invention is not limited to the mechanical coupling structures<br>
depicted in Figs. 5 and 6.<br>
The concept of providing a piston blank with a displaceable flange is not limited to the<br>
embodiments of the invention depicted in Figs. 1-3, 7 and 8-10. In other embodiments the<br>
flanges could be positioned and configured to be bent or folded upward or downward and close<br>
off different areas of the cooling galleries. In other embodiments more than one flange can be<br>
used.<br>
Figures 11-14 exemplify other embodiments ofthe present invention which include<br>
different flange configurations. Each of Figs. 11-14 depicts pistons in which the respective<br>
flanges have been machined and bent or folded into their final positions. However, it is readily<br>
understood that before being machined and bent or folded the flanges extended radially outward<br>
from the sides ofpiston blanks that included features which are generally discussed above.<br>
Figure 11 is a compound cross-sectional view of a piston according to an alternative<br>
embodiment of the present invention. In Fig. 11, the flange 4' was originally configured in the<br>
piston blank so that when it was bent or folded upward (after being machined to size), a top<br>
peripheral edge 29 ofthe flange 4' abutted a peripheral edge 30 provided or formed adjacent to<br>
the top of the piston.<br>
Figure 12 is a compound cross-sectional view of a piston according to another alternative<br>
embodiment of the present invention. In Fig. 12, the flange 4' was originally configured in the<br>
piston blank so that when it was bent or folded upward (after being machined to size) the<br>
abutting surfaces between the peripheral edge 29 ofthe flange 4'and the peripheral edge 30 of<br>
the top ofthe piston met along an angle as shown.<br>
Figure 13 is a compound cross-sectional view of a piston according to another alternative<br>
embodiment ofthe present invention. In Fig. 13, two flanges 4' and 4" were originally provided<br>
and configured in the piston blank so that when the upper flange was bent or folded downward<br>
and the lower flange was bent or folded upward (after being machined to size) the respective<br>
peripheral edges 12' and 12" of the flanges 4' and 4"abutted one another as depicted.<br>
Figure 14 is a compound cross-sectional view of a piston according to another alternative<br>
embodiment ofthe present invention. In Fig. 14, the flange 4' was originally configured in the<br>
piston blank so that when it was bent or folded upward (after being machined to size) the<br>
abutting surfaces between the peripheral edge 12' of the flange 4' and the peripheral edge 30 of<br>
the top ofthe piston met over a portion ofthe cooling gallery 9 as shown.<br>
It is noted that the shape ofthe cooling gallery can be changed to accommodate the use of<br>
different flange configurations.<br>
In each ofthe embodiments depicted in Figs. 11-14 and in other further embodiments of<br>
the present invention that are based upon the general concepts exemplified, the opposing<br>
structures can welded together or otherwise be configured to mechanically interlock using<br>
structural configurations similar to those exemplified and discussed in reference to Figs. 5 and 6<br>
above or similar configurations.<br>
Although the present invention has been described with reference to particular means,<br>
materials and embodiments, from the foregoing description one skilled in the art can easily<br>
