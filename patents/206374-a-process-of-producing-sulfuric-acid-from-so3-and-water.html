				<td>This   invention   relates   to   a   process   of  producing   sulfuric   acid from   SO3   and   water.<br>
Description<br>
This invention relates to a catalyst for reacting SO2 with molecular oxygen to form SO3, and also to a process of producing sulfuric acid from S03 and water, where the SO3 is produced catalytically by reacting SO2 with molecular oxygen<br>
The production of sulfuric acid from S02, which first of all is catalytically oxidized to form S03, is described in detail in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry Sth edi-tion, vol. A25, pages 644 to 664. The known catalysts for the oxidation of S02, which contain for instance V205 as active component, preferably operate at a temperature in the range from 380 to 620°C. Higher temperatures will damage the catalyst. This leads to the fact that the gas supplied to the catalysis should have an S02 content of not more than about 12 vol-%, so that the exothermicity of the oxidation reaction can easily be controlled. The DE-C-27 10 350 describes a catalyst for the conversion of. S02 into S03, which operates at a temperature in the range from 600 to 800°C. The catalyst has a<br>
-1A-<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
silicon oxide carrier with a tridymite structure and an active component containing iron, copper and an alkali metal.<br>
It is the object underlying the invention to create a catalyst suitable for continuous operation, whose activity and stability are also ensured at temperatures of 700°C and above. Furthermore, the catalyst should form the basis for a process of producing sulfuric acid, where gases with a high concentration of SO2 are used.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the catalyst comprises a porous carrier and an active component connected with the carrier, where the active component consists of 10 to 80 wt-% iron, the carrier has a BET surface of 100 to 2000 m2/g and an SiO2 content of at least 90 wt-%, and the weight ratio carrier:active component lies in the range from 1:1 to 100:1. As carrier materials there may be used silicates, in particular zeolites (e.g. zeolites of the beta type), mesoporous silica gels (e.g. synthesized in accordance with U.S. patent  3,556, 725 or MCM-41 of Mobil Oil as pure Si02 material), also those mesoporous silica gels with up to 10 wt-% foreign elements (e.g. boron), diatomaceous earth, amorphous Si02 or mesoporous alumosilicate (e.g. aluminum-containing MCM-41 of Mobil Oil). Advantageous carriers comprise for instance 90 to 100 wt-% of a zeolite or mesoporous Si02. Details concerning the mesoporous Si02 can also be found in WO-A-91/11390 and in "Microporous Materials" 10 (1997), pages 283-286.<br>
The iron-containing active component of the catalyst may in particular consist of at least 80 wt-% iron oxides. The active component may in addition contain sodium, potassium and/or cesium. The content of these alkali metals may be up to 10 wt-%, based on the total weight of the catalyst.<br>
The active component of the catalyst may furthermore include vanadium and/or sulfur compounds (e.g. pyrosulfate). In the<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
active component, the weight ratio V:Fe may lie in the range from 1:1 to 1.3:1. For the sulfate content in the catalyst, l to 7 wt-% are recommended, based on the total weight of the catalyst. When the active component of the catalyst also contains copper, the Cu content will be up to 1 wt-% of the Fe content.<br>
In the laboratory, the following catalysts were prepared:<br>
First catalyst:<br>
As starting material, there was used a mesoporous Si02 with<br>
an ordered pore structure, with amorphous walls and a pore<br>
system with a regular hexagonal array with pore sizes between<br>
2 and 8 nm (synthesized in accordance with WO-A-91/11390). It<br>
has a good thermal stability up to 1000°C and a BET surface<br>
of about 1000 m2/g. To 10 g of an aqueous 25% C16H33N(CH3)3Cl<br>
solution a mixture of 1.8 g soda waterglass (composition:<br>
27.5 wt-% Si02, 8.3 wt-% Na20, plus water), 1.3 g Si02 and 10<br>
g water was added within 15 minutes. After stirring for 30<br>
minutes, the suspension was heated for 48 hours in a screwed<br>
polypropylene vessel to a temperature of 90°C. Then, it was<br>
filtrated, washed and dried for 8 hours at 90°C. The dried<br>
mixture was heated to 550°C with a heating rate of 1°C per<br>
minute and maintained at this temperature for 5 hours. 1 g of<br>
this product were thoroughly mixed with 3.5 ml of a 0.95 mol<br>
Fe(N03) solution and subsequently dried for 2.5 hours at<br>
90°C. The product was stirred for one hour in 25 g distilled<br>
water, filtrated, dried at 90°C and then thermally treated as<br>
follows: heating to 400°C with a rise of 5°C per minute, maintaining at<br>
400°C for 3 hours, then heating to 700°C with a  rise of 5°C per minute,<br>
and subsequently maintaining at this temperature for 3 hours.<br>
The product had a BET surface of 478 m2 /g, the weight ratio<br>
Si:Fe was 5:1.<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
Second catalyst:<br>
3 g commercial Si02 (BASF Dll-10) were added to a solution of 0.18 g NH4VO3 in 20 ml water. Then, 0.62 g Fe(N03)3 9H20, dissolved in 1 g water, were added dropwise by stirring quickly. The product was filtrated, washed, dried, heated to 800°C and maintained at 800°C for 24 hours. The weight ratio Si:Fe:V is 33:1:1.3. In the same way, iron vanadate can be applied onto carriers with a large surface.<br>
Third catalyst:<br>
Here, a zeolite-like iron silicate (structural type beta-zeolite) is used as carrier material; the iron silicate has a<br>
three-dimensional system of micropores and has a large BET<br>
surface of 600 m2 /g. A first aqueous solution was prepared as<br>
follows: 78.5 g 40 % tetraethylammonium hydroxide and 10.7 g 40 % hydrogen fluoride were added to 260.4 g tetraethyl or-thosilicate in a polyproplyene vessel. 70 % of this solution were separated, and to the remaining 30 % of the first solution 3.6 g FeCl3, dissolved in 9 g water, were added by stirring. Finally, there were added 22.2 g NH4F and the previously separated solution. The preparation was heated for 24 hours at 70°C in the open vessel, and the dry gel was subsequently dissolved in 10 g water. Upon inoculation with nuclei (beta-zeolite, 5 wt-%) the product crystallized in the course of 15 days in the polytetrafluoroethylene vessel at 170°C. The product was heated to 200°C with 2°C per minute, maintained at this temperature for 3 hours, then heated to 550°C with 5°C per minute, and maintained at this temperature for 10 hours. The elemental analysis of the product revealed an atomic composition of H:Si:Fe:0:F = 104:60:4.3:178:0.4.<br>
Samples of the three catalysts described above were tested in the laboratory, so as to determine their activity with respect to the oxidation of SO2 to form SO3. Of each catalyst, 0.5 ml of a fraction with particle sizes between 500 and 1000 µm were maintained in the nitrogen stream for three hours at<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
324°C for activation purposes. For measuring the activity, 24.7 ml/min of a gas consisting of 20 vol-% S02, 22 vol-% 02, and 58 vol-% N2 were passed over the activated catalyst samples, where a dwell time of 1.2 s in the catalyst bed was obtained. The activity (percentage of the converted S02) in dependence on the temperature is indicated in the following Table:<br><br>
The catalysts in accordance with the invention are particularly suited as precontact, so as to partly convert a gas with a high content of S02 into SO3 and produce sulfuric acid, before the residual gas with a reduced content of S02 can be passed for instance into a conventional production of sulfuric acid. The gas containing S02 and 02 with an S02 content of 13 to 50 vol-% and an oxygen content corresponding to an 02/S02 volume ratio of at least 1:2 is supplied to a precontact stage, in the precontact stage the gas and the oxygen are passed through at least one bed (precontact bed) of a granular catalyst (precontact), where the precontact has the features described above, and the maximum temperature at the precontact is maintained in the range from 580 to 800°C. In the precontact stage 20 to 80 % of the supplied S02 are converted to S03, and from the precontact stage a first gas mixture containing SO3 is withdrawn, which is cooled to temperatures of 50 to 300°C and is passed into at least one absorber, where in the absorber the first gas mixture is brought in direct contact with circulating sulfuric acid containing water, and a partial stream of sulfuric acid is withdrawn. From the absorber, a second gas mixture containing S02<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
is withdrawn, is heated to a temperature of 380 to 600°C and with an S02 concentration of 10 to 30 vol-% is introduced into a subsequent oxidation stage, in which S02 is catalyti-cally reacted with oxygen at temperatures of 480 to 770°C to form S03. In further process steps, the S03 produced in the oxidation stage is processed to obtain sulfuric acid. In the subsequent oxidation stage, usual catalysts are used. These catalysts may have active components, which for instance consist of at least 5 wt-% V205.<br>
The precontact stage may for instance have at least two pre-contact beds, through which the gas flows one after the other. Expediently, the gas containing SO2, 02 and SO3 is cooled between the precontact beds to temperatures of not more than 550°C. From the last precontact bed a gas is withdrawn after an intermediate absorption with preferably not more than 13 vol-% S02 and is introduced into a subsequent oxidation stage.<br>
A flow diagram of the process will now be explained with reference to the drawing.<br>
A gas rich in S02, to which 02-containing gas (e.g. air) has been admixed through line 3, is supplied to the precontact stage 1 through line 2. The S02 content of the gas in line 2 lies in the range from 13 to 50 vol-% and mostly at least 15 vol-%, and the gas has preferably been preheated to temperatures of 350 to 500°C. In the process variant represented in the drawing, the precontact stage 1 consists of the fixed bed 4 of the temperature-resistant catalyst, which here is referred to as precontact; the bed is referred to as precontact bed 4. It may be expedient to provide at the entrance of the bed 4 a conventional catalyst (e.g. vanadium contact) in a thin layer as a so-called ignition layer, in order to sufficiently increase the temperature in the gas, so that the oxi-<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
dation reaction in the bed of the precontact will fully start immediately.<br>
At the entrance of the precontact bed 4 an 02/S02 volume ratio of at least 0.5:1 is ensured. At the precontact, a rise in temperature is effected by the oxidation reactions during the formation of S03. A first S03-containing gas mixture leaves the precontact stage 1 via line 6 with temperatures in the range from 580 to 800°C and preferably 600 to 700°C. This first gas mixture is cooled in the waste heat boiler 7 to temperatures of 50 to 300°C, where valuable high-pressure steam may be recovered from water. The gas mixture then enters a first absorber 9, which is designed like a Venturi scrubber. Sulfuric acid coming from line 10 is sprayed into the gas, where the concentration of the sulfuric acid is increased by the absorption of S03. The sulfuric acid formed in the first absorber 9 flows through line 11 to a collecting tank 12, excess sulfuric acid, whose concentration usually lies in the range from 95 to 100 wt-%, is withdrawn via line 13.<br>
From the collecting tank 12, through the circulating pump 15 and line 16, sulfuric acid is supplied to the first absorber 9 and also to a second absorber 14, which is connected with the first absorber by the passage 17. S03-containing gas flows through the passage 17 to the second absorber 14 and there upwards through a layer 19 of contact elements, which is sprayed with sulfuric acid from line 10a. Water is supplied via line 20, and the sulfuric acid discharged via line 21 likewise flows into the collecting tank 12. In practice, the absorbers 9 and 14 may also be designed differently than represented in the drawing.<br>
The gas flowing upwards in the second absorber 14 releases sulfuric acid droplets in the droplet separator 24, and then flows through line 25 to a heater 26, which raises the tern-<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
perature of the gas to 380 to 500°C. The gas in line 27, here also referred to as second gas mixture, has an S02 concentration of 10 to 30 vol-%. Due to this relatively low S02 concentration, it may be supplied to a conventional sulfuric acid plant 28, which employs the usual catalysts for oxidizing S02 to form S03. The mode of operation and the structure of such a conventional plant is known and described for instance in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, as mentioned above.<br>
Example:<br>
In the laboratory, the above-described first catalyst is used for partly converting a gas mixture with the components indicated in column A of the subsequent Table to form S03:<br><br>
The data of the example have been calculated in part. The catalyst (precontact) has been formed into cylindrical extru-dates of about 8 mm in height and 6 mm in diameter. The catalyst is distributed over two trays (precontact beds) through which flows the gas mixture one after the other, each tray contains 40 g catalyst with a bed height of 8 cm, the tray diameter is 4.7 cm. On the gas inlet side, each tray has a commercial vanadium catalyst for increasing the temperature ("ignition layer"), so that the desired oxidation takes place at the precontact. The height of the ignition layer is 1 cm.<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
100 1/h of the gas mixture of column A of the above Table enter the ignition layer of the first tray with a temperature of 420°C and the precontact bed with a temperature of 550°C. A gas mixture with the composition indicated in column B of the above Table leaves the first tray with a temperature of 670°C and is cooled to 420°C by an indirect heat exchange. The cooled gas mixture is passed through the second tray, which like the first tray contains an ignition layer and a bed of the precontact. At the outlet of the second tray, the gas mixture has a temperature of 670°C and the composition indicated in column C of the above Table. When this gas mixture is cooled and the S03 is removed through absorption by means of sulfuric acid, as described in conjunction with the drawing, there is obtained a gas mixture with the composition indicated in column D of the above Table. In accordance with the modern prior art (e.g. Lurgi, Frankfurt), this gas mixture with an SO2 content of 14.3 vol-% may be processed in a main converter, where S03 and sulfuric acid are formed and a tail gas with an SO2 content of less than 200 ppm is left.<br><br>
