AN IMPELLER FITTED ON THE PUMP SHAFT<br>
i<br>
 <br>
KIRLOSKAR BROTHERS LIMITED<br>
an Indian Company<br>
of Udyog Bhavan, Tilak Road, Pune 411 002,<br>
Maharashtra, India<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPEC IFICATION DESCRIBES THE INVENTION.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION: This invention relates to a pump.<br>
Particularly, this invention relates to an impeller fitted on the pump shaft.<br>
INTRODUCTION:<br>
A pump is a device used to move liquids from any source location to another location for storage or consumption. Pumps work by using' mechanical forces to push the fluid material, by physically lifting, by the force of compression or by centrifugal force.<br>
Pumps fall into two major groups called roto-dynamic pumps and positive displacement pumps. Roto-dynamic pumps are based on bladed impellers which rotate within the fluid to impart a tangential acceleration to the fluid and a consequent increase in the energy of the fluid. The purpose of the pump is to convert this energy into pressure energy of the fluid to be used in the associated piping system.<br>
A positive displacement pump causes a liquid or gas to move by trapping a fixed amount of fluid or gas and then forcing (displacing) that trapped volume into the discharge pipe. In a roto-dynamic pump the impeller is located on the pump shaft and rotates at high speed.<br>
Some of the roto-dynamic pumps are designed to handle solids along with<br>
the fluid being pumped. Such pumps are widely used in sugar and paper<br>
i industries. These pumps can handle solid particles of maximum size up to<br>
2<br>
 <br>
100mm. These pumps are also used to handle slurry, baggass, animal waste and industrial waste.<br>
The impeller of these pumps has to be removed from the pump shaft for certain maintenance activities like replacement of bearings and to clear excessive buildup of deposit in the pump casing. Removal of the impeller is very difficult as it tends to get jammed on the pump shaft during pumping process of handling solid particles. Typical removal procedure of this type of impeller involves use of wedges and hammering. Excessive use of force will damage the impeller and would require replacement of the same. Also skilled labour will be required to dismantle the impeller from the pump shaft. In viÂ£w of the above there is a need to develop an impeller and a device to facilitate removal of the impeller from the pump shaft.<br>
OBJECTS OF THIS INVENTION:<br>
One of the objects of this invention is to provide an impeller assembly for a solid handling pump that can be dismantled quickly.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide an impeller assembly for a solid handling pump that can be dismantled and reassembled even by unskilled personnel.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide an impeller assembly for a solid handling pump that can be dismantled and reassembled without affecting the rated hydraulic performance of the pump.<br>
3<br>
 <br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide an impeller assembly for a solid handling pump that can be dismantled without the use of wedges and hammering of the impeller.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to provide an impeller assembly for a solid handling pump that is inexpensive to manufacture.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS:<br>
The invention will now be described with respect to the accompanying drawings in which:<br>
j<br>
Figure 1 is a perspective view of the impeller for a solid handling pump as per this invention; and<br>
Figure 2 is the perspective view of the puller unit for the impeller for a solid handling pump of Figure 1.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS:<br>
Referring to Figure 1 an impeller for a solid handling pump as per this invention is indicated generally by the reference numeral 100. The impeller 12 is located on the pump shaft (not specifically shown). The impeller 12 is provided with internal threading 14 on the central portion.<br>
Figure 2 is the impeller puller unit as per this invention generally by the reference numeral 110. The puller unit 110 consists of a central member 16<br>
4<br>
 <br>
provided with external threading 18 complimentary to the threading 14 provided on the central portion of the impeller 12. The central member 16 of the puller unit 110 is also provided with internal threading (not specially shown). A pusher element 22 provided with complimentary external threads 20, is adapted to engage the internal threading (not specially shown) of the central member 16. The pusher element 22 is also provided with handles 24 adapted to operatively move the pusher element 22 with reference to the central member 16.<br>
To dismantle the impeller 12 from a pump shaft (not specifically shown) the puller unit is fitted on the impeller 12  by engaging threads 18 provided on<br>
i<br>
the central member 16 with the threads 14 provided on the impeller 12. At this stage of initial fitting of the central member 16, the pusher element is in a fully retracted position with reference to the central member 16. Once the puller unit: 110 is fitted on the impeller 12, the pusher element 22 is operatively moved forward by turning the handles 24, to abut against the pump shaft (not specifically shown). Further turning of the handle 24 of the pusher element 22 produces the required force to operatively move the impeller 12 away from the pump shaft (not specifically shown) to easily dismantle the impeller 12 from the pump shaft.<br>
This invention provides the following advantages:<br>
â¢	Maintenance cost is reduced.<br>
â¢	Portable puller unit is provided with pump-sets.<br>
â¢	Low skilled manpower can be used.<br>
â¢	Less time and efforts are required.<br>
5<br>
 <br>
While considerable emphasis has been placed herein on the various components of the preferred embodiment, it will be appreciated that many alterations can be made and that many modifications can be made in the preferred embodiment without departing from the principles of the invention. These and other changes in the preferred embodiment as well as other embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the disclosure herein, whereby it is to be distinctly understood that the foregoing descriptive matter is to be interpreted merely as illustrative of the invention and not as a limitation.<br>
