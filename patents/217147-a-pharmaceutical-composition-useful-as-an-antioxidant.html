Tinospora crispa Mier. (Synonyms Tinospora tuberculata Beumee and Tinospora<br>
rumphii Boerl. (Family Minispermaceae). It is found in Assam, Burma, cultivated in<br>
Malaya Peninsula and Ceylon [Chadha, Y. R., The Wealth of India, Raw materials,<br>
Publication and Information Directorate, CSIR, New Delhi, Vol. X, Page 252, 1976]. The<br>
whole plant is exceedingly bitter, and is employed by Malays in the cure of intermittent<br>
fever, in India and China the stem is considered a febrifuge of great importance,<br>
widespread opinion that it is an excellent tonic during convalescence from exhausting<br>
diseases. In the Philippine Islands it is considered to be panacea to be applied to all<br>
bodily afflictions. It is given in general debility in chronic rheumatism, in malarial fevers<br>
[Kiritikar, K. R., Basu, B. D. and An I. C. S., Indian Medicinal Plants, Second Edition,<br>
International Book Distributors, Dehradun, India, Vol. I, Page 76, 1987].<br>
So far very little chemistry have been done on Tinospora crispa. Tinocrisposide, a<br>
bitter furanoditerpene glycoside has been isolated from Tinospora crispa stem [Pachaly,<br>
P. and Adnan, A. Z., Arch. Pharm. (Weinheim) 325, 705-708 (1992). NFormylannonaine,<br>
N-formylnornuciferine and N-acetylnomuciferin have been reported to<br>
be present in stems.<br>
Many furano diterpenoid glycosides borapetoside A-G have been isolated from<br>
Tinospora tuberculata [Fukuda, N., Yonemitsu, M., and Kimura, T., Liebig. Ann. Chem.,<br>
491-494 (1993)]. Furano diterpenes tinotufolin A and B were isolated from Tinospora<br>
tuberculata [Fukuda, N., Nakamura, M., Yonemitsu, M., Kimura, T., Isobe, R. and<br>
Komori, Tetsuya [Liebig. Ann. Chem. 325-327 (1993)].<br>
Several furano diterpene glucosides have been isolated from Tinospora rumphii<br>
stems [Martin, T. S., Ohtani, K., Kasai, R. and Yamasaki, K., Phytochemistry, 40, 1729-<br>
1736 (1995) and Martin, T. S., Ohtani, K., Kasai, R. and Yamasaki, K., Phytochemistry,<br>
42,153-158(1996)].<br>
Till today there is no report of the isolation of bergenin from Tinospora<br>
crispa. However, it has been isolated earlier from Bergenia crassifolia roots [Hay, J. E.<br>
and Haynes L. J., Journal of Chemical Society, 2231-2238(1958)] and from Bergenia<br>
ligulata roots [Jain, M. K. and Gupta, R., Journal of Indian Chemical Society, 39, 559-560 (1962). The isolation procedure described by Hay et al was as follow: The roots and<br>
rhizomes of Bergenia crassifolia (1 kg. wet weight) were thoroughly dried in vacuumoven<br>
at 60° and ground to powder (446 g) which was poured into acetone (1 1) contained<br>
in a glass column (24 x 2.5 in.). After 16 hr. the column was eluted with acetone (total<br>
volume, 2.5 1) and three fractions were removed. Paper chromatography of each fraction<br>
in butanol-acetic acid-water (4:1:5) and butanol-ethanol-water (4:1:5) showed the same<br>
phenolic component to be present in each fraction, detected as an orange spot on spraying<br>
of the air-dried paper with diazotised sulphanilic acid in 10% aqueous sodium carbonate;<br>
no other phenolic products were detected. The fractions were concentrated to brown<br>
syrups, dissolved in acetone, and set aside. Crystalline bergenin separated from each<br>
fraction, in a total yield of 15 g. Recrystallisation from water yielded the hydrate, m.p.<br>
133°. Several recrystallisation from methanol followed by thorough drying (6 hr. at 150°)<br>
gave anhydrous bergenin, m.p. 238°.<br>
However, there has been no report on the isolation of bergenin, which is<br>
useful as a free radical scavenging agent from Tinospora crispa.<br>
Word "antioxidants" and "oxidative stress" are widely used but surprisingly<br>
difficult to define precisely. For example, the term antioxidant as used in the literature is<br>
often implicitly restricted to chain-breaking antioxidant inhibtors of lipid peroxidation.<br>
In particular, food scientists frequently equate antioxidants to inhibitors of lipid<br>
peroxidation because they use antioxidants largely to prevent rancidity. However, free<br>
radicals generated in vivo damage proteins, lipids, DNA and other molecules in addition<br>
to lipids. For that reason an antioxidant is any substance, when present at low<br>
concentrations compared to these of an oxidizable substance, significantly delays or<br>
prevents oxidation of that substance [Halliwell, B. and Gutteridge, J. M. C, Mehods<br>
Enzymol., 186, 1-85 (1990)]. The term oxidizable substrate includes almost everything<br>
found in living cells, including proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and DNA.<br>
Oxidative stress, denoting a disturbance in prooxidant/antioxidant balance in<br>
favour of prooxidants, leading to potential damage. However, the novel role of oxidants<br>
and antioxidants as part of signalling cascade, as mediators of adaptive responses has<br>
opened new area of active research. Although it is too early to speak of "free radical<br>
diseases", but evidences are there for the crucial roles of oxidants and antioxidants in<br>
disease states. As most diseases ultimately lead to cell injury or cell death. It is<br>
postulated that several of the stress-induced diseases may be due to oxidative stress<br>
brought about by either increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) or<br>
decreased free radical scavenging activity.[ Richard, R. T. and Sharma, M. M., Ind. J.<br>
Clin. Pract., 2, 15-18 (1991)]. It has been proposed that neutrophils could contribute to<br>
the ulceration process through the release of tissue damaging proteases and reactive<br>
oxygen metabolites.<br>
Role of oxygen radical have been implicated in causation of several diseases such<br>
as liver cirrhosis, athlerosclerosis, cancer, diabetes, ageing etc. and the drugs that can<br>
scavenge oxygen radical have great potential in ameliorating these disease processes.<br>
Although the body has several mechanisms to protect the action of oxygen radicals at<br>
times these protective mechanisms are not sufficient when compared to the insult<br>
produced to the body. Supplementation of non-toxic antioxidants may have<br>
achemoprotective role in the body in these conditions [Joy, K. L., Kuttan, G. and Kuttan,<br>
R., Ind. J. Expt. Biol., 37, 1177-1181 (1999)]. The superoxide anion (O2"), H202 and<br>
hydroxyl radical ('OH) are the major ROS which induce cell degeneration by increasing<br>
lipid peroxidation of cell membrane lipids. The toxic end products of the structural and<br>
functional integrity of cell membranes, break DNA stand and denaturate cellular proteins<br>
[Bhattacharya, A. and Ghosal, S., Ind. J. Expt. Biol., 38, 877-880 (2000)].<br>
The natural cellular antioxidant enzymes include superoxide dismutase (SOD),<br>
which scavenges superoxide radicals by speeding up their dismutation, Catalase (CAT) a<br>
haeme enzyme which removes H2O2 and glutathione peroxidase (GPX), a seleniumcontaining<br>
enzyme which scavenges H2O2 and other peroxidases [Halliwell, B. and<br>
Gutteridge, J. M. C., "Free radicals in Biology and Medicine", 2nd Ed. Clarendon, Press,<br>
Oxford, 1989]. Detoxification of the superoxide anion is not a terminating step in free<br>
radical scavenging, since the enzyme catalysed dismutation results in the production of<br>
H2O2 which accumulates in the mitochondria and cytosol. Unless the peroxide is<br>
scavenged by CAT and GPX, it in the presence of iron, may also lead to production of<br>
HO'. These ROS together with singlet molecular oxygen, may attack lipid, protein and<br>
DNA of cells following increased lipid peroxidation chain reaction resulting in wide<br>
spread cellular injury and ultimately pathophysiological conditions.<br>
In the recent years, ROS and lipid peroxides have been implicated in the<br>
pathogenesis of a large number of diseases and environmental toxicities, these include<br>
rheumatoid, arthritis, dermatitis, hepatitis, ahterosclerotic cardiovascular disease, diabetes<br>
melitus, chronic bronchitis, crohn's disease, ulceration, side-effects of radiation and<br>
carcinogenesis [Niwa, Y., Ind. J. Clin. Prac., 1(8), 23-27 (1991)].<br>
Agents that degenerate ROS and/or lipid peroxidation might therefore, be<br>
beneficial in the treatment of many of these disorders by removal of O2, scavenging<br>
reactive oxygen/nitrogen species or their precursors, inhibiting ROS/RNS formation,<br>
binding metal ions needed for catalysis of ROS generation and upregulation of<br>
endogenous antioxidant defences.<br>
Thus the main objective of the present invention is to provide berginin as an<br>
antioxident with free radical scavenging activity obtained from a new source namely<br>
Tinospora cripsa<br>
Another object is to provide a process for the isolation of bioactive bergenin from<br>

Another object of this invention is to provide antioxidant and free radical<br>

Accordingly,the presently invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition useful<br>

.hi still another embodiment of the invention a method for the treatment of<br>
radical scavenging and antioxidant comprising the steps of administration of an<br>

In our copending patent application no nf 260/01, we have claimed and disclosed a<br>
process for the isolation of bioactive bergenin from Tinospora crispa.<br>
Characterisation of bergenin (1).<br>
Bergenin (1) obtained as crystalline compound, m.p. 237°C, [a]o20 -36.9° (c<br>
1.85, methanol), FABMS m/z 351 [M+Na]+, Molecular formula Ci4H16O9. UV spectrum<br>
recorded in methanol showed absorption maxima at 224, 273, 310 nm. IR (KBr)<br>
spectrum showed absorption's at 3300, 1710, 1620, 1600, and 1470 cm'1. 1H NMR<br>
(200.13 MHz, Pyridine-ds) showed signals at δ 7.67 (1H, s), 5.16 (1H, d, J=10.2Hz),<br>
4.00-4.70 (6H, m, sugar protons) and 3.94 (3H, s, Ar-OCHO. The I3C NMR spectrum<br>
also showed signals at δ 165.7, 152.0, 149.0, 142.0, 119.0, 117.1, 110.5, 82.0, 80.5, 75.0,<br>
73.5,71.1,62.0,60.1.<br>
Further the structure of bergenin (1) was confirmed by converting it to<br>
pentacetate. 1 (100 mg) was dissolved in pyridine (2ml), to this was added acetic<br>
anhydride (2ml); the reaction mixture was kept at room temperature over night. The<br>
solvents were removed under high vacuum. The residue obtained was crystallised with<br>
mixture of hexane-ethyl acetate, MP. 201°C, !H NMR (200.13 MHz, CDC13) showed<br>
signals at δ 7.80 (IH, s), 5.52 (IH, t, J=9.3Hz), 5.16 (IH, t, J=9.4Hz), 4.84 (IH, d,<br>
J=10.6Hz), 4.39 (IH, t, J=10.4Hz), 4.35 (IH, m), 4.18 (IH, dd, J=12.6, 3.7Hz), 3.95 (3H,<br>
s), 3.85 (IH, m), 2.38 (6H, s), 2.14 (6H, s), 2.10 (3H, s). This is the first reported<br>
isolation of bergenin from genus Tinospora.<br>
Thus the location of collection of the raw material (Tinospora crispd), extraction<br>
and process of isolation of 1 has been standardised for maximum yield of the compound.<br>
The process being simple and novel is particularly useful for quick isolation of the<br>
compound from the plant for all purposes.<br>
Bergenin is a potent antioxidant and free radical scavenging molecule. On testing it<br>
against sodium nitroprusside induced nitric oxide production (for direct free radical<br>
scavenging) and DPPH interaction (a stable free radical) showed highly significant<br>
and dose related inhibition of free radical production and scavenging.<br>
The invention is described in detail by the examples given below which should<br>
not be construed to the limit of scope of the present invention.<br>
Example 1:<br>
The shade dried, powdered Tinospora crispa stems (0.5 kg) were extracted with<br>
rectified spirit (2.0 1) by hot continuous extraction in a Soxhlet apparatus for 32 hours.<br>
The rectified spirit was evaporated under reduced pressure to obtain a brown mass, and<br>
this extract was triturated successively with hexane (200 ml x 4), chloroform (200 ml x<br>
4), and ethyl acetate (200 ml x 4). The residue left was dissolved in methanol (35 ml)<br>
and left in refrigerator overnight, filtered the solid separated, crystallised with methanol,<br>
furnished bergenin (1.5 g).<br>
Example 2:<br>
The shade dried, powdered Tinospora crispa stems (0.5 kg) were extracted with<br>
methanol by hot continuous extraction in a Soxhlet apparatus for 32 hours. The methanol<br>
(2.0 1) was evaporated under reduced pressure to obtain a brown mass, and this extract<br>
was triturated successively with hexane (200 ml x 4), chloroform (200 ml x 4), and ethyl<br>
acetate (200 ml x 4). The residue left was dissolved in methanol (35 ml) and left in<br>
refrigerator overnight, filtered the solid separated, crystallised with methanol, furnished<br>
bergenin (1.4 g).<br>
Example 3:<br>
The shade dried, powdered Tinospora crispa stems (0.5 kg) were percolated with<br>
rectified spirit (4x1.5 1) for a period 64 hours. The rectified spirit was evaporated under<br>
reduced pressure to obtain a dark green mass, and this extract was triturated successively<br>
with hexane (200 ml x 4), chloroform (200 ml x 4), and ethyl acetate (200 ml x 4). The<br>
residue left was dissolved in methanol (35 ml) and left in refrigerator overnight, filtered,<br>
the solid separated, crystallised with methanol, furnished bergenin (1.0 g).<br>
Example 4:<br>
The shade dried, powdered Tinospora crispa stems (0.5 kg) was percolated with<br>
methanol (4x 1.5 1) for a period 64 hours. The solvent was evaporated under reduced<br>
pressure to obtain a dark green mass, and this extract was triturated successively with<br>
hexane (200 ml x 4), chloroform (200 ml x 4), and ethyl acetate (200 ml x 4). The<br>
residue left was dissolved in methanol (35 ml) and left in refrigerator overnight, filtered,<br>
the solid separated, crystallised with methanol, furnished bergenin (0.9g).<br>
The activity testing illustrated in the following examples, which should not be<br>
construed to the scope of invention:<br>
Example 5:<br>
Nitric oxide was generated from sodium nitroprusside and measured by Griess<br>
reaction. Sodium nitroprusside in aqueous solution at physiological pH spontaneously<br>
generates nitric oxide, which interacts with oxygen to produce nitrite ions, which can be<br>
estimated by use of Griess reagent. 0.5 ml of sodium nitroprusside (5mM) in phosphatebuffered<br>
saline was mixed with compound 1 at different concentrations dissolved in 30%<br>
DMSO and incubated at 25°C for 150 min. A similar control was also run in which an<br>
equal amount of DMSO was added in place of test drug. After 150 minutes of incubation<br>
the samples were diluted with 0.5 ml of Griess reagent. The absorbency of the<br>
chromophore formed during diazotization of sulphanilamide with nitrite and subsequent<br>
coupling with napthylethylenediamine was read at 546nm.<br>
Example 6:<br>
0.5 ml of sodium nitroprusside (5mM) in phosphate-buffered saline was mixed<br>
with compound 1 at different concentrations dissolved in 30% DMSO and incubated at<br>
25°C. Samples were taken after every 30 minute, starting from 0 to 210 minutes and<br>
diluted with 0.5 ml of Griess reagent. The absorbance of the chromophore formed during<br>
diazotization of sulphanilamide with nitrite and subsequent coupling with<br>
napthylethylenediamine was read at 546nm. The time dependent oxygen scavenging was<br>
calculated as compared to the control group.<br>
Example 7:<br>
Interaction of compound 1 with DPPH.<br>
To a solution of DPPH (final concentration 100 umol/L) in absolute ethanol, an<br>
equal volume of the compound dissolved in ethanol was added at various concentrations<br>
(25-200 µg/ml). A similar control was also run where only ethanol was added in place of<br>
test drug. After 20 min. at room temperature, absorbance was recorded at 517 nm. Each<br>
experiment was performed in triplicate and the standard deviation in absorbance values<br>
was less than ±5%. The percent inhibition of DPPH interaction was calculated as<br>
compared to the ethanol treated control as shown in table 1.<br>
Antioxidant and free radical scavenging activity.<br>
It is postulated that several of the stress induced diseases may be due to oxidative<br>
stress brought about by either increased generation of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) or<br>
decreased free radical scavenging activity [Richard, R. T. and Sharma, M. M, Ind. J.<br>
Clin. Pract., 2, 15-18 (1991)]. It has been proposed that neutrophils could contribute to<br>
the ulceration process through the release of tissue damaging proteases and reactive<br>
oxygen metabolites.<br>
The superoxide anion (CV), H2O2 and hydroxyl radical (HO) are the major ROS<br>
which induce cell degeneration by increasing lipid peroxidation of cell membrane lipids.<br>
The toxic end products of peroxidation induce damage of the structural and functional<br>
integrity of cell membranes, break DNA strands and denaturate cellular proteins<br>
[Bhattacharya, A. and Ghosal, S., Ind. J. Expt. Biol., 38, 877-880 (2000)].<br>
Our study with bergenin demonstrates it to be a potent antioxidant and free radical<br>
scavenging molecule. On testing it against sodium nitroprusside induced nitric oxide<br>
production (for direct free radical scavenging) and DPPH interaction (a stable free<br>
radical) showed highly significant and dose related inhibition of free radical production<br>
and scavenging.<br>
Bergenin when tested against nitric oxide production, a free radical generation<br>
from sodium nitroprusside, it showed a dose related and significant inhibition, at higher<br>
doses, of NO production. Sodium nitroprusside in aqueous solution at physiological pH<br>
spontaneously generates nitric oxide [Green, L. C., Wishnok, J. and Tannenbaum, S. R.,<br>
Anal. Biochem. 126, 131-136 (1982) and Marcocli, L., Maguire, J. J., Droy-Lefaiz, M. T.<br>
and Packer, L., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 201, 748-755 (1994] which interacts<br>
with oxygen to produce nitrite ions and can be estimated by use of Griess reagent<br>
[Marcocli, L., Packer, L., Droy-Lefaiz, M. T., Sekaki, A. and Gardes-Albrt, M., Methods<br>
Enzymol., 234, 462-475 (1994)]. Scavengers of nitric oxide compete with oxygen<br>
leading to reduced production of NO.<br>
NO generated from sodium nitroprusside reacts with oxygen to form nitrite.<br>
Bergenin inhibits nitric oxide formation by competing with oxygen to react with nitric<br>
oxide. The inhibition in the NO formation might be a result of direct scavenging of<br>
presence of free radicals. It produced an inhibition of 10 to 57% at a dose level of 25 to<br>
200 µg/ml where as the standard drug used silymarin showed 68% inhibition at a dose of<br>
50 µg/ml (Table 1).<br>
The results of bergenin against the interaction with the nitrogen-centred stable<br>
free radical 1, l-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) showed slightly less inhibition as<br>
compared to the sodium nitroprusside induced NO production. The effect was significant<br>
at higher dose level (200 µg/ml) Table-1. The interaction of the compounds against<br>
DPPH expresses the reducing activity of the compound and indicates the ability of<br>
scavenging free radicals [Ratly, A. K., Sunammoto, J. and Das, N. P., Biochem.<br>
Pharmacol. 37, 989-991 (1988)]. The interaction of bergenin with DPPH attributes its<br>
free radical scavenging activity where as the nitric oxide scavenging ability speaks its<br>
role as potent antioxidant [Sreejayan and Rao, M. N. A., J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 46, 1013-<br>
1016(1994).<br>
Table-1: Effect of bergenin on direct oxygen scavenging by NO produced from sodium<br>
nitroprusside and interaction with DPPH.<br>
Treatment<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
Bergenin has shown a significant antioxidant and free radical scavenging activity<br>
against sodium nitroprusside induced nitric oxide production for direct free radical<br>
scavenging and DPPH interaction (a stable nitrogen centred free radical). Since the<br>
molecule has shown free radical scavenging and antioxidant activity, it can be a useful<br>
remedy from natural source for the reduction of reactive oxygen species mediated<br>
damage to the cells and ultimately for the amelioration of diseases caused by imbalance<br>
between oxidative stress and antioxidant defence.<br><br><br><br>
We claim:<br>
1 . A pharmaceutical composition useful as antioxidant with free radical scavenging<br>
activity comprising an effective amount of bergenin along with a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable additives.<br>
2. A composition as claimed in claim 1 wherein, the additive is selected from<br>
nutrients, which are pharmaceutically acceptable carriers.<br>
3. A composition as claimed in claim 1 wherein, the composition is in the form of<br>
tablet, syrup, powder, capsule..<br>
4. A composition as claimed in claim 1 wherein bergenin is used as an oxident at a<br>
dose level of at least 200 µg / ml<br>
5. A method for the treatment of radical scavenging and antioxidant comprising the<br>
steps of administration of an effective amount of bergenin to a subject in need<br>
thereof.<br>
6. .A method as claimed in claim 5 wherein percent inhibition achieved interaction<br>
with DPPH is 38.54.<br>
7. A method as claimed in claimed in claim 5 wherein percent inhibition of NO<br>
production is 57. 03 at a dose level of at least of 200 µg/ ml.<br>
8. A pharmaceutical composition useful as an antioxidant with free radical<br>
scavenging activity, substantially as herein described with reference to the<br>
examples . <br></td>
