				<td>Tool Coupler<br>
The invention relates to a tool coupler for connecting a replaceable tool head to a<br>
machine tool comprising an at least partly or fully conical or cylindrical hollow shaft and a<br>
ring-shaped collar interacting with a correspondingly configured receiving bore hole and<br>
a ring-shaped opposite surface of a basic holder on a machine tool, where the basic<br>
holder and the tool coupler can be locked by means of clamping elements actuated via a<br>
clamping device in such a way that the collar of the tool coupler abuts on the opposite<br>
surface of the basic holder, and the tool coupler is provided with a continuous gripper<br>
groove for a gripping device used in automatic tool replacement.<br>
Couplers of this type are known, for example, from EP 0 343 190 B1 where the latter<br>
coupler works with balls as clamping elements, which are driven via a tension rod<br>
radially outward when the tool is mounted and radially inward when the tool is removed<br>
into existing openings. Another comparable tool coupler with wedge-shaped clamping<br>
elements is shown and described in DE 38 07 140 C2. The combination of a hollow cone<br>
shaft, which, compared to the respective receiving bore hole is slightly overdimensioned<br>
in the range of elastic deformation, with the mutual flat abutment achieves high axial<br>
rigidity under static and dynamic load forming a tool coupler for connecting a tool holder<br>
and a basic holder, possibly in the form of a machine tool spindle seat, which is useable<br>
in tool machines for turning, drilling and milling. As a result, the machine tool can be<br>
used as a machining center for many different cutting operations. In fully automated<br>
production, the so-called tool replacement systems are becoming increasingly important<br>
where, instead of manually replacing the tool, a gripper groove is provided on the tool<br>
head or on the tool coupler for replacing the tool head.<br>
However, in order to precisely adjust the tool head and tool coupler, which may also be separate<br>
intermediate piece for seating and mounting a tool head, in a machine tool spindle or a basic holder<br>
on the one hand and a tool magazine, such as a revolving disk, on the other hand, with regard to<br>
the angle of rotation, further positioning elements are required. According to prior art, catches or<br>
other switching areas and locating faces disposed on the outside surface of the tool coupler are<br>
used in connection with positioning elements, such as pins in the basic holder or a machine<br>
spindle. In order to orient the tool coupler in the magazine on the one hand and in the tool coupler<br>
seat on the other hand and for preventing 180° misalignments, such switching areas and locating<br>
faces are provided on diametrically opposite surface areas of the tool coupler.<br>
For the tool carrier according to EP 1 007 265 Bl, diametrically opposite recesses are used, which<br>
have to be configured with varying geometry for the above mentioned reasons. The unbalance<br>
resulting from said configuration manifests itself especially in tools rotating at high speed. In order<br>
to compensate said source of unbalance and other unbalances resulting from asymmetrical tool<br>
coupler configurations, it is proposed for the tool carrier according to EP 1 007 256 Bl to provide<br>
one or more bore holes on the inside of the tool carrier. However, the tool carrier of EP 1 007 256<br>
B1 is disadvantageous in that it matches only one certain machine tool type.<br>
Further, reference may be made to DE 3916315 and EP 1339014.<br>
DE 3916315 is directed to a tool shank for milling cutters, end mills, boring tools, tool holders,<br>
etc. This is produced with a regular curviliear polygonal collar which engages positively with a<br>
matching bore in the spindle nose and permits high rotational speeds in the range 10,000 to<br>
100,000 rpm without slipping. Alternatively, the drive may be transmitted by a collar having<br>
backwards pointing gear formed teeth which engage with corresponding teeth on the end face of<br>
the spindle nose. The groove has diametrically opposed holes which can be engaged by Hie gripper<br>
mechanism of an automatic tool changer. The small gap (a) between the flange and spindle nose is<br>
witness that the taper shank is properly seated.<br>
EP 1339014 relates to an information-holding unit which can minimize increase in cost and which<br>
can increase storage capacity as a whole without changing information transferring time. The<br>
information-holding unit comprises a plurality of RFID tags with desired specific information<br>
stored therein, and a tool holder as a mounting body for mounting these plural RFID tags.<br>
Yet further, reference may be made to XP 241534 and DE 3326615 relating to tool couplings<br>
comprising of a microchip arranged in the gripping groove and having a readable memory.<br>
However, a diametrically opposite hole is neither disclosed nor suggested in order to avoid<br>
unbalance.<br>
The objective of the present invention is to improve the tool coupler so as to provide an alternative<br>
that is universally useable for multiple types of machines and allowing maximum position<br>
accuracy for the angle of rotation with maximum weight compensation so as to prevent unbalanced<br>
when the tool is replaced automatically.<br>
According to this invention there is provided a tool coupler for connecting a replaceable tool head<br>
to a machine tool comprising an at least partly or fully conical or cylindrical hollow shaft and a<br>
ring-shaped collar interacting with a correspondingly configured receiving bore hole and a ring-<br>
shaped opposite surface of a basic holder on the machine tool, where the basic holder and the tool<br>
coupler can be locked by means of clamping elements actuated via a clamping device in such a<br>
way that the collar of the tool coupler abuts on the opposite surface of the basic holder, and the<br>
tool coupler is provided with a continuous gripper groove for a gripping device used in automatic<br>
tool replacement, characterized in that the gripper groove is provided with two diametrically<br>
opposite blind bore holes with varying bore hole contours, and additionally, two more<br>
diametrically opposite blind bore holes are provided wherein one of the additional blind bore holes<br>
is provided with a microchip comprising a readable memory with information for tool<br>
identification or coding.<br>
The problem is solved by means of the tool coupler, where, in accordance with the invention, the<br>
gripper groove is provided with two diametrically opposite blind bore holes with varying bore hole<br>
contours. In contrast with the solutions of the prior art, the diametrically opposite arrangement of<br>
the bore holes in the groove largely counteracts the unbalance. Additional bore holes for<br>
compensation of unbalance weakening the body of the coupler otherwise are not required, which<br>
advantageously simplifies the manufacture of such tool couplers. The advantageously conical<br>
configuration of the hollow shaft in connection with the flat abutment and the radially outward<br>
moving clamping elements for clamping the tool coupler, especially clamping balls, which are<br>
subjected to centrifugal forces when the tool rotates, achieves dynamic rigidity in addition to static<br>
rigidity and prevents unbalance up to high speeds. Furthermore, the varying contours of the<br>
diametrically opposite blind bore holes can be made such that, both statically and dynamically<br>
(under rotation), the "mass removed" via the recesses is fully or at least substantially compensated.<br>
The blind bore holes are further advantageous in that they, in connection with positioning pins,<br>
allow an accurate tool coupler adjustment, both axially and with regard to the angle of rotation, so<br>
that tool misalignments are virtually impossible.<br>
Refinements of the invention are described in the sub-claims. For example, the blind bore holes are<br>
advantageously disposed centrically relative to the gripper groove, and as a further advantage, their<br>
diameter is greater, at least in the top area, than the width of the groove.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, in cross section, the blind bore holes can have<br>
to top area, which is wider in diameter and an additional area with a smaller diameter joining the<br>
bore hole bottom, advantageously, the diameter in the upper area are identical.<br>
The bottom area of the step-like configured blind bore hole uniformly has a smaller, but<br>
possibly different diameter on opposite sides. Accordingly, one of the blind bore holes<br>
may have a smaller diameter in the bottom area and a greater depth, and vice versa, on<br>
the other side, it may have a comparatively greater diameter, but a lesser depth. The<br>
varying geometry can also be realized by means of a partly conical bore hole bottom or<br>
a flat bore hole bottom, thereby effectively preventing 180° errors in the angle of rotation<br>
for the tool coupler of the invention.<br>
Furthermore, for automated tool replacement, it is desirable that the respective tool or<br>
tool head can be automatically identified. According to prior art, readable microchips<br>
integrated on or in the tool coupler are available for tool identification. Maximum<br>
readability is ensured when the microchips are provided on the outside surface of the<br>
body of the respective carrier. If, according to a further embodiment of the invention, a<br>
tool coupler is used with two additional diametrically opposite blind bore holes disposed<br>
so as to be offset by 90° relative to the above described blind bore holes (with varying<br>
contours), the microchip can be mounted in one of said bore holes. The resulting radial<br>
inward move adequately protects the microchip against external mechanical effects.<br>
Such additional diametrically opposite bore holes have an identical or substantially<br>
identical contour. While one of the additional bore holes serves to receive the microchip,<br>
the opposite bore hole eliminates the static dynamic unbalance. Advantageously, said<br>
two bore holes are configured flat, which means they have a greater diameter than the<br>
measure of their depth. The diameter of the bore holes can be identical to the diameter<br>
of the top areas of the two blind bore holes with varying contours.<br>
If required, however, each of said additional bore holes can be used in the manner<br>
described above with respect to the blind bore holes, so that in principle, four bore holes,<br>
offset by 90° can be used for positioning or adjusting the tool head.<br>
According to another embodiment, the whole of the four existing blind bore holes in the<br>
form of two diametrically opposite bore hole pairs is configured such that the tool coupler<br>
is fully balanced.<br>
Depending on the intended use, the tool couplers can vary in size matching the size of<br>
the spindle or other adapters and intermediate pieces that are used. The standard<br>
system sizes range between 32 mm and 160 mm, preferably between 40 mm and 100<br>
mm. The standard diameters are between 40 mm and 80 mm. Depending on the<br>
diameter of said tool couplers, a greater or smaller diameter is used for the blind bore<br>
holes. Advantageously, the diameters range between 10 mm and 20 mm, especially<br>
between 10 mm and 16 mm.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, based on a frontal view of the tool<br>
coupler, the blind bore holes with varying contours are disposed on a vertical plane<br>
relative to the connecting line of the openings in the hollow shaft for locking the clamping<br>
elements. Accordingly, the additional blind bore holes, one of which carries the<br>
microchip, are offset by 90°.<br>
An exemplary embodiment of the invention is illustrated in the drawings, as follows:<br>
Fig. 1 is a perspective view of a tool coupler of the invention;<br>
Figs. 2 and 3 are side views of said tool coupler, offset by 90°;<br>
Fig. 4 is a sectional view of said tool coupler in the area of the blind bore holes, and<br>
Figs. 5 to 7 are the cross-sections of the respective blind bore holes.<br>
The tool coupler illustrated in Fig. 1 has a hollow shaft 10 with a conical outside surface<br>
provided with opposite openings 11 by means of which the tool coupler can be mounted<br>
in a machine spindle in connection with ball-shaped clamping elements (not shown).<br>
Furthermore, the tool coupler has a ring-shaped collar interacting with a correspondingly<br>
configured ring-shaped opposite surface of a basic holder on the machine tool. Tool<br>
couplers of this kind have been described in detail in EP 0 343 190 B1, for example. In<br>
addition, the tool coupler is provided with a substantially V-shaped continuous gripper<br>
groove 13 in which a gripping device (not shown) engages when the tool is replaced. On<br>
the side opposite the hollow shaft 10, the actual tool head is mounted for carrying the<br>
tool (not shown).<br>
According to the invention, the tool coupler is provided with two first diametrically<br>
opposite blind bore holes 14 and 15 whose varying cross-sections are illustrated in Figs.<br>
5 and 6. Said bore holes or their connecting line is vertical relative to the connecting line<br>
of the two above described openings 11 in the hollow shaft 10. Flat bore holes 16 with<br>
the same contours are offset by 90° and diametrically opposite. Their connecting line is<br>
disposed parallel to the connecting line of the two openings 11. The bore hole 16 shown<br>
in Fig. 1 serves as a compensating bore hole for eliminating the unbalance which would<br>
be generated if the opposite bore hole 16, in which the microchip is disposed, were the<br>
only one. Said microchip comprises a data memory containing the identification codes<br>
for the respective tool. The bore holes 14, 15 and 16 are disposed centrically relative to<br>
the gripper groove, as illustrated by Figs. 2 and 3. In this case, the bore hole 16 has a<br>
substantially uniform diameter a of 10 mm with a lesser bore hole depth b of 5.4 mm.<br>
As shown in Fig. 7, however, the bore hole may deviate slightly from a cylindrical form<br>
and taper conically toward the open side. 'A microchip is disposed in one of the bore<br>
holes 16 and comprises a memory with readable information for tool identification. Said<br>
microchip arrangement in the bore hole 16 protects the microchip against external<br>
mechanical damage.<br>
The bore holes 14 and 15, on the other hand, have varying contours. According to a<br>
special exemplary embodiment, the top area 17 of said bore holes 14 and 15 has the<br>
same contour as bore hole 16. It is joined by a bottom area 18 or 19. The bore hole 14<br>
shown in Fig. 5 has a bottom area 18 with a cylindrical area joined by a conically<br>
configured bore hole bottom 20. Said bore hole 14 is used for the controlled positioning<br>
of the tool coupler in the seat provided in the machine (spindle or basic holder), where it<br>
can be determined, for example by means of spring-loaded pins with a conical end in the<br>
basic holder, when the tool coupler and thus the tool head have reached the position<br>
with the desired angle of rotation. The opposite bore hole 15 instead has a cylindrical<br>
bottom area 19 with a smaller diameter than the top area 17, but the bore hole is<br>
considerably flatter, i.e. it has a lesser depth. The bore hole 15, in connection with<br>
respective positioning pins, serves to orient the tool coupler in a magazine.<br>
