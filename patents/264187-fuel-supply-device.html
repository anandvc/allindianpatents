				<td>FUEL SUPPLY DEVICE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a fuel supply device, according to which a pump module is arranged in a fuel tank so as to supply fuel from the fuel tank to an internal combustion engine, which is separated from the fuel tank.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A fuel supply device is known in the art, for example, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No.2006-144596 {also referred to as Prior Art No.l), according to which a pump module (having a fuel pump necessary for fuel supply) is assembled to a cover member for covering an opening of a fuel tank. According to the fuel supply device of Japanese Patent Publication No.2006-144596, multiple functional parts for the pump module to be supported by the cover member are arranged in such a space, which is virtually formed by a trajectory drawn by the cover member when the cover member is assembled to the opening of the fuel tank. As a result, the pump module can be inserted into the fuel tank through the opening thereof and arranged in the fuel tank, even in the case that the opening is formed as small as possible.<br>
Another fuel supply device is also known in the art, for example, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication NO.2004-28S930 (also referred to as Prior Art No. 2) , according to which a pressure regulating device for regulating pressure of fuel discharged from the fuel supply device at an appropriate value is provided as one of the functional parts other than the fuel pump.<br>
A further fuel supply device is known in the art, for example, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No.2006-161599 (also referred to as Prior Art No.3), according to which a brush-less type motor is incorporated in the fuel pump, and a driving circuit for controlling an operation of the brush-less type motor and an external<br><br>
terminal for electrically connecting the driving circuit with an external power supply device are integrally formed as one unit, for the purpose of making the fuel supply device smaller in its structure.<br>
However, in the case that the pressure regulating device (such as disclosed in Prior Art No.2) is provided as one of the functional parts for the pump module, an electric circuit (such as disclosed in Prior Art No.3) is used, and the arrangement for the multiple functional parts and the electric circuit are modified so as to make a size of the opening for the fuel tank smaller, it may happen depending on a certain arrangement of the functional parts that the fuel containing vapor gas is maintained in a fuel discharge passage during a non-operation of the internal combustion engine-<br>
In the case that the vapor gas is contained in the fuel discharge passage, the vapor gas may be pushed by discharged fuel from the fuel pump when re-starting the engine, so that such fuel containing the vapor gas may be supplied to the engine. As a result, the fuel of appropriate amount can not be supplied to the engine, to thereby decrease start-up performance.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is made in view of the above problem. It is an object of the present invention to provide a fuel supply device, which is smaller in size and which can improve fuel supply performance during a start-up operation of the engine.<br>
According to one of features of the present invention, a fuel supply device (10) is provided in a fuel tank (20} for supplying fuel from the fuel tank to an internal combustion engine. The fuel supply device (10) has:<br>
a bottom cover member (30) attached to an opening (22) of the fuel tank (20);<br>
a pump module (80) supported by the bottom cover member (30) and having a fuel pump (40) for pressurizing and pumping out the fuel, a pressure regulator (50) communicated with an outlet oort<br><br>
{42) of the fuel pump (40) for discharging excessive fuel from the fuel pump (40) back into the fuel tank {20) so as to regulate pressure of the fuel discharged from the fuel pump (40), and a first fuel discharge passage (33) for supplying the fuel from the fuel pump (40) to the internal combustion engine; and<br>
an electric circuit module (90) supported by the bottom cover member (30} and having a driving circuit portion (95) electrically connected to the fuel pump (40) for controlling an operation of the fuel pump (40), and outer terminals (96) for electrically connecting the driving circuit portion (95) with an outside electric power source.<br>
In the above fuel supply device, the electric circuit module (90) passes through the bottom cover member (30), such that the outer terminals (96) are arranged at an outer side of the fuel tank (20),<br>
the electric circuit module (90) is of f set from the pump module (80) in a plane of the bottom cover member (30),<br>
a longitudinal direction of the pump module (80) is arranged to be parallel to an arrangement line of the pump module (80) and the electric circuit module (90),<br>
the fuel pump (40) and the pressure regulator (50) are arranged in series in a normal line to the bottom cover member (30), and<br>
the pressure regulator (50) is arranged at a position above the first fuel discharge passage (33) in a direction of gravity.<br>
According to the above feature, the pump module (80) and the electric circuit module (90) are arranged at the bottom cover member (30) in such a manner that the electric circuit module (90) is of fset from the pump module (80) in the plane of the bottom cover member (30) . Each of the pump module (80) and the electric circuit module (90) extends from the bottom cover member (30} into the inside of the fuel tank (20), but they do not interfere with each other. As a result, a length of the fuel supply device (10) in its normal line can be reduced.<br>
In addition, the longitudinal direction of the pump module (80) is arranged to be parallel to the arrangement line of the pump<br><br>
module (80) and the electric circuit module (90) . And the fuel pump (40) and the pressure regulator (50) are arranged in series in the normal line of the bottom cover member (30) . As a result, a length of the fuel supply device (10) is reduced in a direction perpendicular to the normal line of the bottom cover member (30).<br>
Furthermore, the pressure regulator (50) is arranged at a position above the first fuel discharge passage (33), which extends from the outlet port of the fuel pump (40) to the bottom cover member (30), in a direction of gravity. Accordingly, vapors contained in the fuel of the first fuel discharge passage (33) can move toward the pressure regulator (50), after stop of the engine operation. As a result, the vapor contained in the fuel is suppressed from flowing together with the fuel discharged from the fuel pump (40) toward the engine, when the engine is re-started. Fuel supply performance at the engine starting operation is thereby improved.<br>
According to another feature of the present invention, an axial direction of the fuel pump (40) as well as an axial direction of the pressure regulator (50) is arranged in the same direction to the longitudinal direction of the pump module (80).<br>
According to the above feature, a width of the pump module (80) can be further reduced, because the axial direction of the fuel pump (40) is in the same direction to the axial direction of the pressure regulator (50). In particular, this feature is advantageous in the case that only a longitudinal opening can be formed in the fuel tank.<br>
According to a further feature of the present invention, the opening (22) is formed at a bottom wall (21) of the fuel tank (20) , the pump module (80) has a suction filter (70) for removing foreign material contained in the fuel to be sucked into the fuel pump (40) , one longitudinal end of the suction filter (70) is connected to an inlet port (41) of the fuel pump (40), and the fuel pump (40) is arranged at such a position closer to the bottom cover member (30) than the pressure regulator (50).<br>
According to the above feature, the fuel pump (40) is arranged<br><br>
at a'position closer to the bottom wall of the fuel tank. As a result, even in the case that fuel level is lowered, the fuel can be sufficiently sucked into the fuel pump 40.<br>
According to a still further feature of the present invention, the pump module (80) has a vapor outlet port (62) for discharging vapor generated at the fuel pump (40) , and an excessive fuel outlet port (63) for discharging excessive fuel from the pressure regulator (50), and each of the vapor outlet port (62) and the excessive fuel outlet port (63) is formed in such a manner that fuel flow to be discharged therefrom is directed toward such a direction other than the direction toward the suction filter (70).<br>
Vapors are likely to be included in the fuel discharged from the fuel pump (40) or in the excessive fuel discharged from the pressure regulator (50).  Therefore, pump efficiency may be reduced, if the fuel discharged from the vapor discharge port or the excessive fuel discharge port is sucked into the fuel pump.<br>
However, since each of the vapor outlet port (62) and the excessive fuel outlet port (63) is so formed that the fuel flow to be discharged therefrom is directed toward such a direction other than the direction toward the suction filter (70), there is no fear that the fuel containing the vapors is not sucked into the fuel pump through the suction filter. The fuel pump efficiency is thereby suppressed from being decreased.<br>
According to a still further feature of the present invention, the pump module (80) has a second fuel discharge passage (34) , which is arranged at a position above the first fuel discharge passage (33) in the direction of gravity, one end of the second fuel discharge passage (34) is communicated with the first fuel discharge passage (33), and the other end thereof is communicated to the pressure regulator (50), and the first and second fuel discharge passages (33 and 34} are formed in a straight shape and coaxially arranged.<br>
According to the above feature, a structure of the pump module (80} can be made simpler, because the first and second fuel discharge passages (33 and 34) are formed in a straight shape and coaxially<br><br>
arranged.<br>
According to a still further feature of the present invention, the first and second fuel discharge passages (33 and 34) are formed in the normal line to the bottom cover member (30).<br>
According to such feature, the vapors contained in the fuel may easily move toward the second fuel discharge passage (34), because the first and second fuel discharge passages (33 and 34) are formed in the normal line of the bottom cover member (30).<br>
According to a still further feature of the present invention, the fuel supply device (10) is provided at the bottom wall (21) of the fuel tank (20) for a motor cycle.<br>
The fuel tank for the motor cycle is generally smaller than that for a passenger car. Accordingly, a place for forming the opening (22) is limited.  In addition, a size of the opening (22) has a limit.<br>
However, the fuel supply device of the present invention can be mounted in the fuel tank (at the bottom wall thereof) for the motor cycle, for which there are various limitations for forming the opening (22), In particular, the present invention can be preferably applied to such a fuel tank, which has a smaller bottom wall, for example, a saddle type fuel tank for the motor cycle.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present Invention will be explained with reference to an embodiment of the invention. A fuel supply device according to the embodiment of the invention is shown in Figs. 1 to 3. Fig. 1 is a cross-sectional view showing the fuel supply device, whereas Fig.<br>
2	is a view when viewed in a direction II shown in Fig. 1, and Fig.<br>
3	is a view when viewed in a direction III shown in Fig. 1.  Fig. 1 shows the cross-sectional view taken along a line I-I of Fig. 2.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, a fuel supply device 10 is fixed to a bottom wall 21 of a fuel tank 20 for a motor cycle. According to the embodiment of the invention, the fuel tank 20 is of a saddle type.<br>
The fuel supply device 10 is composed of a bottom cover member 30, a fuel discharge pipe 31, a fuel passage member 32, a supporting ineraber 35, claws 38, a fuel pump 40, a pressure regulator 50, an electric circuit module 90, and so on.<br>
The bottom cover member 30 is made of resin material such as polyacetal (POM) and formed into an elliptical shape so as to cover an opening 22 formed at the bottom wall 21 of the fuel tank 20. The fuel discharge pipe 31, the fuel passage member 32, the supporting member 35 and the claws 38 are made of resin and integrally formed with the bottom cover member 30.<br>
The fuel discharge pipe 31 supplies the fuel discharged by the fuel pump 40 to a fuel injection device (not shown) of a fuel injection system, which is provided out of the fuel tank 20.<br>
The fuel passage member 32 is integrally formed with the bottom cover member 30, in such a manner that the fuel passage member 32 projects from the bottom cover member 30 in a direction to an inside of the fuel tank 20. The fuel passage member 32 introduces the fuel discharged by the fuel pump 40 not only into the fuel discharge pipe 31 but into the pressure regulator 50. The fuel passage member 32 is supported by the bottom cover member 30, so that one end of the fuel passage member 32 is communicated to a first fuel discharge passage 33 formed in the fuel discharge pipe 31. The other end of the fuel passage member 32 is communicated to the pressure reaulator<br><br>
50 -through another (second) fuel discharge passage 34.<br>
The first and second fuel discharge passages 33 and 34 are coaxially formed in a straight line, as shovm in Fig, 1. The second fuel discharge passage 34 is arranged at a position, which is above the first fuel discharge passage 33 in a direction of gravity, when the bottom cover member 30 is assembled to the opening 22 of the fuel tank 20, as shown in Fig. 1.<br>
The supporting member 35 is integrally formed with a side wall of the fuel passage member 32 for supporting the fuel pump 40 and the pressure regulator 50. The supporting member 35 has a pump supporting portion 36 for supporting the fuel pump 40 and a regulator supporting portion 37 for supporting the pressure regulator 50.<br>
The pump supporting portion 36 is formed into a cup shape, and a bottom portion of the cup-shaped pump supporting portion 36 is communicated with the first and second fuel discharge passages 33 and 34. The regulator supporting portion 37 is also formed into a cup shape in a similar manner to the pump supporting portion 36. A bottom portion of the cup-shaped regulator supporting portion 37 is communicated with the second fuel discharge passage 34 . As shown in Figs. 1 and 3, the pump supporting portion 36 and the regulator supporting portion 37 are integrally formed with the fuel passage member 32 in such a manner that each axial direction thereof is in parallel to a longitudinal direction of the bottom cover member 30.<br>
As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, a through-hole 39 is formed in the bottom cover member 30 at such a position, which is an opposite side of the pump supporting portion 36 in the longitudinal direction of the bottom cover member 30. More exactly, the pump supporting portion 36 as well as the regulator supporting portion 37 is formed on a left-hand side (in Fig. 1) of the fuel passage member 32, whereas the through-hole 39 is formed on a right-hand side (in Fig. 1) of the fuel passage member 32. The electric circuit module 90 is inserted into the through-hole 39.<br>
Multiple claws 38 are formed around a periphery of the through-hole 39, on a side of the inside of the fuel tank 20, for<br><br>
supporting the electric circuit module 90.<br>
An outer shape of the fuel pump 40 is formed into a cylindrical form and its cylindrical outer side wall is supported py the pump supporting portion 36. When the fuel pump 40 is inserted into and supported by the pump supporting portion 36, the axial direction of the fuel pump 40 is almost in parallel to the longitudinal direction of the bottom cover member 30. The fuel pump 40 is composed of a motor portion and a pump portion driven by the motor portion. According to the embodiment, a brushless motor is used as the motor portion and Wesco-type pump is used as the pump portion.<br>
An inlet port 41 as well as a vapor discharge port (not shown) for discharging vapor generated when the pump portion is operated is formed at one axial end of the fuel pump 40 (left-hand end in Fig. 1) . An outlet port 42 is formed at the other axial end of the fuel pump 4 0 (right-hand end in Fig. 1) for pumping out fuel pressurized by the pump portion. The outlet port 42 is arranged at the bottom portion of the pump supporting portion 36, so that the outlet port 42 is communicated with the first and second fuel discharge passages 33 and 34. The fuel pumped out from the outlet port 42 is supplied to the first and second fuel discharge passages 33 and 34.<br>
The pressure regulator 50 discharges an excessive amount of the fuel pumped out from the fuel pump 4 0 to adjust the fuel pressure in the first fuel discharge passage 33. An outer shape of the pressure regulator 50 is also formed into a cylindrical form and its cylindrical outer side wall (right-hand side in Fig. 1) is supported by the regulator supporting portion 37 . As in the similar manner to the fuel pump 40, when the pressure regulator 50 is inserted into and supported by the regulator supporting portion 37, the axial direction of the pressure regulator 50 is almost in parallel to the longitudinal direction of the bottom cover member 30.<br>
An inlet port 51 and a discharge port 52 are respectively formed at axial ends of the pressure regulator 50. The inlet port 51 is arranged at the bottom portion of the regulator supporting<br><br>
portion 37 so that the inlet port 51 is coimnunicated with the second fuel discharge passage 34 . The fuel pumped out from the outlet port 42 of the fuel pump 40 flows to the inlet port 51 through the second fuel discharge passage 34.<br>
The pressure regulator 50 has such a structure for connecting the inlet port 51 with the discharge port 52, when the fuel pressure in the second fuel discharge passage 34 becomes higher than a predetermined value.<br>
The excessive amount of the fuel is discharged as a result that the inlet port 51 is communicated with the discharge port 52, when the fuel pressure in the second fuel discharge passage 34 becomes higher than the predetermined value. Accordingly, the fuel pressure in the first fuel discharge passage 33 is regulated at a predetermined value.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, a cap member 60 is provided at an open side of the supporting member 35 (that is, a left-hand side in Fig. 1) for covering the axial end of the fuel pump 40 (a side of the inlet port 41) as well as the axial end of the pressure regulator 50 (a side of the discharge port 52) . The cap member 60 is made of the polyacetal (POM) as in the same manner to the bottom cover member 30. The cap member 60 is fixed to the pump supporting portion 3 6 and the regulator supporting portion 37 by means of a fixing means, which is made of engaging claws and engaging holes.<br>
A fuel passage 61 is formed in the cap member 60 for communicating the inlet port 41 of the fuel pump 40 with a space outside of the cap member 60. A suction filter 70 is attached to the fuel passage 61 for removing foreign material contained in the fuel to be sucked into the fuel pump 40. A longitudinal direction of the suction filter 70 is substantially aligned with the axial direction of the fuel pump 40.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 3, the suction filter 70 extends from the fuel pump 40 in the longitudinal direction of the pump module 80 opposite to the electric circuit module 90, so that the suction filter 70 does not interfere with the electric circuit module 90.<br><br>
The suction filter 70 has a frame portion 71 and a filter element 72 covering the frame portion 71. The filter element 72 is made of non-woven material. The filter element 72 covers the frame portion 71, so that a room is formed in an inside of the filter element 72.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, a vapor outlet port 62 is formed at the cap member 60 for discharging the fuel containing the vapor (which is discharged from the vapor discharge port of the fuel pump 40) to the outside of the cap member 60 . As shown in Fig. 1, an excessive fuel outlet port 63 is formed at the cap member 60 for discharging the excessive fuel (which is discharged from the discharge port 52 of the pressure regulator 50) to the outside of the cap member 60.<br>
Each of the outlet ports 62 and 63 is formed at the cap member 60 in such a manner that fuel flow to be discharged from the outlet port 62 (or 63) is directed toward such a direction other than the direction toward the suction filter 70. More exactly, the vapor outlet port 62 is directed to the bottom of Fig. 3, whereas the excessive fuel outlet port 63 is directed to the top of Fig. 1.<br>
According to the above structure, the fuel discharged from the outlet ports 62 and 63 and containing the"vapor is suppressed from being sucked again into the suction filter 70, so that a decrease of fuel pump efficiency can be suppressed.<br>
According to the embodiment, a pump module 80 is composed of the fuel passage member 32, the supporting member 35, the fuel pump 40 and the pressure regulator 50.<br>
The electric circuit module 90 is composed of a casing 91, a driving circuit portion 95, outer terminals 96, inner terminals 97, lead wires 98 and so on.<br>
The casing 91 is made of PPS resin (polyphenylene-sulphite resin) and formed into a cylindrical shape.  The casing 91 accommodates the driving circuit portion 95. A portion of the casing 91 is inserted into the through-hole 39 formed in the bottom cover member 30. Multiple projections 92 are formed at one end of the casing 91 (on a side to the inner space of the fuel tank 20),<br><br>
so that the projections 92 are engaged with the claws 38 when the casing 91 is inserted into the through-hole 39 in order to prevent the casing 91 from dropping out from the through-hole 39. An 0-ring is provided between the casing 91 and the through-hole 39 to seal a gap between them.<br>
The PPS resin is more resistive than the POM resin against the fuel, so that the fuel is prevented from flowing into the inside of the casing 91 even in the case that the casing is exposed to the fuel. As a result, an adverse affect by the fuel to the driving circuit portion 95, which is less resistive against the fuel, can be suppressed.<br>
The casing 91 has an accommodating portion 93 and a connector portion 94 on an outer side of the fuel tank 20, when the casing 91 is fixed to the bottom cover member 30, wherein the accommodating portion 93 accommodates the driving circuit portion 95 and the connector portion 94 electrically connects the driving circuit portion 95 with an outside electrical power source (not shown).<br>
The accommodating portion 93 is formed into a recessed shape and accommodates the driving circuit portion 95 at its bottom portion. The accommodating portion 93 is filled with resin after the driving circuit portion 95 is accommodated in the accommodating portion 93. The driving circuit portion 95 has an electric circuit for supplying electrical power to the brushless motor of the fuel pump 40.  The driving circuit portion 95 is composed of IC chips.<br>
The connector portion 94 is formed at a side portion of the casing 91 and adjacent to the accommodating portion 93. A pair of outer terminals 96, which is electrically connected to the driving circuit portion 95, is provided in the connector portion 94 by means of an insert-molding method. The outer terminals 96 connect the driving circuit portion 95 with the outside electrical power source.<br>
The inner terminals 97 are electrically connected to the driving circuit portion 95 for supplying driving current generated at the driving circuit portion 95 to the fuel pump 40 via the lead wires 98.  The inner terminals 97 are provided in the casing 91 on<br><br>
the inner side of the fuel tank 20 by the insert-molding method, such that portions of the inner terminals 97 are exposed to the outside of the casing 91.<br>
The above components for driving the fuel pump 40, such as the driving circuit portion 95, the outer terminals 96, the inner terminals 97 are formed as one module, so that the electric circuit module 90 can be made smaller in size.<br>
An operation of the fuel supply device 10 according to the embodiment of the present invention will be explained. When the electric power is supplied to the driving circuit portion 95 from the outside electrical power source (not shown) via the outer terminals 96, the driving circuit portion 95 generates the driving current to be supplied to the fuel pump 40.<br>
The driving current generated by the driving circuit portion 95 is supplied to the fuel pump 40 through the inner terminals 97 and the lead wires 98. The motor portion of the fuel pump 40 is thereby driven to rotate so that the pump portion is operated. When the pump portion is operated, suction force is generated at the pump portion, so that the fuel in the fuel tank 20 is sucked into the pump portion through the suction filter 70 and the inlet port 41. The sucked fuel is pressurized by the pump portion and pumped out from the outlet port 42. At the same time, vapor generated at the pump portion is discharged from the vapor outlet port 62 through the vapor discharge port (not shown).<br>
The fuel discharged from the outlet port 42 flows through the first fuel discharge passage 33 and discharged from the fuel discharge pipe 31 to an internal combustion engine (not shown) . The fuel pressure in the first fuel discharge passage 33 is controlled at the predetermined value by the pressure regulator 50, which is connected to the first fuel discharge passage 33 through the second fuel discharge passage 34.<br>
When the operation of the internal combustion engine is stopped, the operation of the fuel pump 40 is also stopped. When the operation of the fuel pump 40 is stopped, the fuel pressure in<br><br>
the first fuel discharge passage 33 (which has been controlled at the predetermined value) is decreased. When the fuel pressure in the first fuel discharge passage 33 is decreased, the vapor contained in the fuel is expanded- Furthermore, as a result that multiple vapors are combined together, the vapors become further larger. The vapors generated in the first fuel discharge passage 33 move up in the first fuel discharge passage 33 and flow into the second fuel discharge passage 34. Then, the vapors are accumulated in the second fuel discharge passage 34 and the pressure regulator 50.<br>
When the fuel pump 40 is operated again to start up the internal combustion engine, the vapors do not flow together with the fuel discharged from the fuel pump 40 toward the engine, because the vapors are kept in the second fuel discharge passage 34 and the pressure regulator 50, The vapors are discharged from the second fuel discharge passage 34 to the fuel tank 20 via the pressure regulator 50 (through the excessive fuel outlet port 63).<br>
Advantages of the embodiment will be explained. According to the embodiment, the pump module 80 (which is composed of the fuel passage member 32, the supporting member 35, the fuel pump 40, and the pressure regulator 50) and the electric circuit module 90 are arranged at the bottom cover member 30 in series on a plane of the bottom cover member 30. Namely, the electric circuit module 90 is off set from the pump module 80 in the longitudinal direction of pump module 80 on the plane of the bottom cover member 30. In other words, the electric circuit module 90 is separated from the pump module 80 on the plane of the bottom cover member 30. Accordingly, even when each of the pump module 80 and the electric circuit module 90 extends from the bottom cover member 30 into the inside of the fuel tank 20, they do not interfere with each other. As a result, a length of the fuel supply device 10 in a normal line to the bottom cover member 30 can be reduced.<br>
According to the embodiment, the longitudinal direction of the pump module 80 (that is, the axial direction of the fuel pump 40 as well as the axial direction of the pressure regulator 50) is<br><br>
arranged to be parallel to an arrangement line of the pump module 80 and the electric circuit module 90. And the fuel pump 40 and the pressure regulator 50 are arranged in series in the normal line to the bottom cover member 30. As a result, a length of the fuel supply device 10 is reduced in a direction perpendicular to the normal line to the bottom cover member 30. In other words, a length of the fuel supply device 10 between the pump module 80 and the electric circuit module 90 in the horizontal line can be reduced.<br>
The pressure regulator 50 is arranged at a position above the fuel pump 40 (that is, above the first fuel discharge passage 33} in a direction of gravity (i.e. in a vertical direction). Accordingly, vapors contained in the fuel of the first fuel discharge passage 33 can move toward the second fuel discharge passage 34 and the pressure regulator 50, after stop of the engine operation. As a result, the vapor contained in the fuel is suppressed from flowing together with the fuel discharged from the fuel pump 40 toward the engine, when the engine is re-started. Fuel supply performance at the engine starting operation is thereby improved.<br>
The first and second fuel discharge passages 33 and 34 are formed in a straight shape and coaxially arranged, so that the fuel supply device 10 can be made in a simpler structure. In addition, in the case that the bottom cover member 30 is made of resin-molding, a structure of dies for the resin-molding can be likewise made simpler, to thereby suppress an increase of manufacturing cost.<br>
Furthermore, the first and second fuel discharge passages 33 and 34 are formed in the normal line to the bottom cover member 30. This structure easily moves the vapors contained in the fuel toward the second fuel discharge passage 34.<br>
According to the embodiment, the fuel pump 40 is arranged at such a position closer to the bottom cover member 30 than the pressure regulator 50. Accordingly, the fuel pump 40 can be arranged in the fuel tank 20 at a position close to the bottom wall 21 of the fuel tank 20. As a result, even in the case that fuel level is decreased, the fuel can be sufficiently sucked into the fuel pump 40.<br><br><br>
