Examples<br>
Example 1: Preparation of octyl-^'-octylaminomethyl-biphenyM-vlmethyn-amine<br>
(compound of formula (3V)<br>
4.20 g (20 mmol) of 4/4'-biphenyl dicarboxaldehyde are dissolved in 50 ml of absolute THF<br>
under nitrogen. 4.80 g (80 mmol) of acetic acid and 5.69 g (44 mmol) of octylamine are<br>
added dropwise thereto and the mixture is heated for 1 hour at 60°C. After cooling with an<br>
ice-bath, 10.17 g (48 mmol) of sodium triacetoxyborohydride are added in portions. The<br>
reaction mixture is stirred overnight at room temperature. 100 ml of water are placed in a<br>
container and the reaction mixture is added using a pipette. The pH is adjusted to 1 with 6N<br>
hydrochloric acid. The THF is distilled off, and the product is filtered off and washed with<br>
900 ml of water.<br>
The product is then suspended in ethyl acetate, adjusted to pH 13 with sodium hydroxide<br>
solution and then filtered off again.<br>
The product is washed with 300 ml of water. Excess octylamine is distilled off under a high<br>
vacuum.<br>
Yield:   84 % (GC purity: 88 %)<br>
NMR (methanol):       0.8 ppm (6H); 1.2 ppm (20H); 1.45 ppm (4H); 2.5 ppm (4H);<br>
3.7 ppm (4H); 7.3 ppm (4H); 7.5 ppm (4H)<br>
Example 2: Preparation of octyl-^'-octylaminomethyl-biphenyl^-ylmethylVamine (compound of formula (3V)<br>
A suspension of BCMD (1.00 mol) in toluene (2600 ml) is treated while cold with an excess of n-octylamine (5.00 mol). After reaction for one hour at 80°C, the conversion is complete. The reaction suspension is washed out with water (1000 ml) and 50 % NaOH (200 g). The solvents (toluene/n-octylamine) are distilled off in vacuo (60-120°C/20 mbar).<br><br>
The oily residue is taken up in warm ethyl acetate (1200 ml), clarified on a suction-filter<br>
(BCMD polymer), cooled to 35°C and seeded.<br>
After further cooling to 0°C, the crystalline product is filtered off, washed with solvent and<br>

dilution of 1:2.<br>
Bacteria and yeast are cultured overnight in CASO bouillon.<br>
All test organism suspensions are adjusted to an organism count of 1 - 5 x 106 CFU/ml with 0.85 % sodium chloride solution.<br>
