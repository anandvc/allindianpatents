				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the field of personal care compositions comprising essential oils. More specifically, the present invention provides personal care compositions comprising a mixture of essential oil components having improved hyposensitivity whilst maintaining well-rounded fragrance characteristics and aromatherapeutic application.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Many personal care compositions on the market today contain essential oils as fragrances, and more recently as active ingredients useful for the treatment of a variety of ailments. Such uses have been generated out of the interest associated with aromatherapy, in which various essential oils are vaporized and inhaled by the user. This practice has led to the use of rosemary and lavender oils for relaxation, eucalyptus and citrus oils for the treatment of respiratory infections, and a variety of other novel oils used as analgesics, muscle relaxants and the like.<br>
Essential oils are a mixture of chemical entities, the majority of which are terpene-like materials. Each essential oil comprises a unique mixture of terpenes and other similar materials that provide the individual fragrance and activity of the essential oil. The composition of an essential oil is dependent not only upon the source of the oil, but also upon the method of extraction. Different extraction methods can generate essential oils having differing levels and ratios of important components, and this in turn can result in essential oils having different fragrance and activity profiles, despite being isolated from the same source.<br>
A problem associated with essential oils is the fact that they can contain auxiliary fragrance materials some of which are recognized as potential allergens and/or irritating agents. These materials, in a proportion of the population, can cause hypersensitivity-type reactions, or skin irritation, manifested as skin redness, burning, itching, and in severe cases, edema and skin peeling. Unfortunately, these same auxiliary fragrance materials such as limonene, linalool, benzyl alcohol and geraniol in combination with terpenes such as a- and P-pinene and α-phellandrene are typically fundamental to the fragrance of the essential oil and, in some instances, required for the purported aromatherapeutic activity of the oil in question.  By simply eliminating these auxiliary<br>
fragrance materials in the essential oil, the oil typically does not meet the user's expectation in both fragrance impact and roundness and aromatherapeutic activity. Therefore, a need exists for personal care compositions comprising essential oils or materials thereof, which have improved allergen profiles. More precisely, a need exists for personal care compositions comprising essential oils that have reduced levels of auxiliary fragrance materials, but also a select level and ratio of these materials in combination with a base fragrance and specific terpene materials in order to deliver the fragrance and activity of the essential oil without associated sensitivity problems.<br>
US 5,298,238 to Hussein et al. discloses liquid oral compositions comprising deterpenated and fractionated peppermint oil. The compositions therein comprise very low levels of 1,8-cineole, a- and p-pinenes and linalool and limonene. US Application 2003/0012830 Al discloses a topical composition comprising eucalyptol, a-pinene and acetone. EP 1048293 A discloses head-lice treatment compositions comprising eucalyptol and limonene in water. WO 98/17749 discloses an essential oil extracted from the shrub Kunzea Ambigua which contains high levels of a- and p-pinenes. WO 98/17229 discloses medicaments comprising at least 25% eucalyptol, and at least 25% limonene. US Application 2003/0113277 Al discloses oral care compositions comprising eucalyptol and limonene for masking the taste of phenolics such as triclosan present in the compositions. The above compositions either do not deliver the required reduced level of auxiliary fragrance materials to avoid sensitivity reactions and therefore are not hyposensitive formulae, or do not contain enough auxiliary fragrance materials to generate a well-rounded fragrance or associated aromatherapeutic activity.<br>
It has been found that personal care compositions can be formulated with essential oil component materials that reconstitute the essential oil in the composition to maximize the fragrance and activity associated with the essential oils therein, whilst improving the hyposensitivity of the compositions by selectively blending the constituent fragrance materials. It has further been found that removing the auxiliary fragrance materials entirely lessens the impact of the essential oil, and that by incorporating these materials at low levels and in select ratios with other terpene materials, a mixture is generated having fragrance and activity similar to the pure extracted essential oil that is gentle to skin.<br>

a carrier.<br>
The compositions herein are gentle to skin and have a fragrance and aromatherapeutic activity almost as if the composition were made using the pure extracted essential oil.<br>
The personal care compositions of the present invention comprise a base fragrance material. The base fragrance material of the present invention comprises eucalyptol. Kucalyptol is also known as 1,8-cineole, and is a terpene-like material isolated from and named for eucalyptus essential oil. Eucalyptol is widely found in essential oils and used in synthetic fragrances in varying amounts. It is thought to be an important component of eucalyptus oil and other essential oils, and responsible for a wide variety of activities and fragrances associated therewith. Eucalyptol generally has a chemical structure as set out below:<br>
hk; personal care compositions of the present invention comprise from about 0.01% to about 15% eucalyptol. Preferably the personal care compositions herein comprise from about 0.1% to about 10%, more preferably from about 0.2% to about 8%, more preferably still from about 0.5% to about 5% eucalyptol by weight.<br>
Eucalyptol is commercially available extracted from natural sources such as eucalyptus oil. Suitable examples of commercially available sources include eucalyptol available from Symrise (UK), Frey and Lau (UK) or FDL (UK).<br>
Flie personal care compositions of the present invention further comprise a terpene material. Said teipene material comprises ct-pinene, p-pinene, a-phellandrene, para-cymene or mixtures thereof. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the terpene material is useful herein, in combination with the allergenic fragrance material, for generating the characteristic fragrance notes, and providing effects such as relaxation, calming, muscle relaxation and analgesia associated with essential oils such as eucalyptus, rosemary and lavender.<br>
The compositions of the present invention comprise from about 0.01% to about 10% terpene material, preferably from about 0.1% to about 6%, more preferably from about 0.5% to about 5% terpene material by weight, more preferably still from 0.5% to<br>
The terpene materials according to the present invention correspond to the chemicals having the structure as set out in the table below.<br>
The personal care compositions of the present invention comprise from about 0.0001% to about 0,01% auxiliary fragrance material. The auxiliary fragrance material of the present invention comprises amyl cinnamal, benzyl alcohol, cinnamyl alcohol, citral, eugcnol, hydroxy-citronellal, isoeugenol, amylcin-namyl alcohol, benzyl-salicylate, cinnamal, coumarin, geraniol, hydroxy-methylpentylcyclohexanecarboxaldehyde, anisyl alcohol, benzyl cinnamate, farnesol, 2(4-tert-butylbenzylpropionaldehyde), linalool, benzyl benzoate, citronellol, hexyl cinnam-aldehyde, limonene, methyl heptin carbonate, 3-methyl-4-(2,6,6-tri-methyl-2-cyclohexen-l-yl)-3-buten-2-one, or mixtures thereof. Preferably said auxiliary fragrance material comprising limonene, linalool, benzyl alcohol, geraniol or mixtures thereof. Auxiliary fragrance materials are materials that are recognized as potentially potent allergens and/or irritating agents. These materials, in a proportion of the population, can cause hypersensitivity-type reactions, or skin irritation, manifested as skin redness, burning, itching, and in severe cases, edema and skin peeling. Unfortunately, these same materials are typically fundamental to the fragrance of the essential oil and, in some instances, required for the purported aromatherapeutic activity. However, simply removing these materials reduces the fragrance and effectives of the personal care composition. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the compositions herein, by using these auxiliary fragrance materials at levels that typically do not generate sensitivity reactions, but whilst still being present in the composition, generates a subliminal fragrance change to the user, and is capable of providing the aromatherapeutic activities associated with pure essential oils.<br>
The personal care compositions of the present invention preferably comprise from about 0.0001 % to about 0.005% auxiliary fragrance materials, more preferably from about 0.0001% to about 0.001%. Preferably, the terpene material and the auxiliary fragrance material are formulated in the personal care compositions herein in ratios that<br>
enable the materials to act synergistically to provide fragrance and active benefits, whilst not generating a sensitivity-type response. Without being limited by theory, it is believed thai both the auxiliary fragrance materials and terpene materials are essential to elicit the consumer response to essential oils, however, the combination herein allows the amount of auxiliary fragrance material present to be limited whilst still providing fragrance and active benefits. Preferably the ratio of terpene material to auxiliary fragrance material is from about 1:1 to about 1:10000, more preferably from about l:10to about 1:1000.<br>
The personal care compositions of the present invention further comprise a earner. The carrier may be any material capable of carrying and delivering the fragrance materials herein in a stable and consumer-aesthetic form. Such carriers must also be suitable for application to the skin, hair, oral mucosa, preferably the skin (i.e. topical application), more preferably sensitive skin such as that of a baby. Suitable carriers include water, (.:, to Q, monohydric alcohols, petrolatum, fluid silicone materials such as dirnethicones, or mixtures thereof. Preferred carriers herein include water, petrolatum, or mixtures thereof. Preferably, the compositions of the present invention comprise from about 1% to about 99.9799% carrier, more preferably from about 40% to about 95%, more preferably still from about 50% to about 93% carrier.<br>
The personal care compositions of the present invention may be in any form suitable for consumer use. The compositions may be formulated as a leave-on composition or a rinse-off composition. As used herein, "leave-on compositions" includes products that are intended to be applied to a bodily surface of a consumer such as the skin or hair and maintained on the surface for a prolonged time, preferably at least 5 minutes, more preferably at least 30 minutes, without being actively removed by washing, rinsing, wiping, rubbing or other forms of mechanical removal. As used herein, "rinse-off compositions" includes compositions that are intended to be applied to a bodily surface of a consumer, such as the skin or hair, and subsequently removed by washing, rinsing, wiping, rubbing or other forms of mechanical removal within less than 5 minutes of application. Preferably, the composition is a leave-on composition.<br>
The personal care composition of the present invention may be formulated as a lotion, an aerosol, a cream, a gel, a, liquid, a viscous liquid, or a paste. Alternatively, the compositions herein may comprise a patch that can be applied to the user's body or clothing. Preferably, such patches comprise an adhesive layer that enables attachment to the user's body or clothing. In a further alternative embodiment, the compositions herein need not be applied directly to the user's body or clothing, but rather be applied to an<br>
object thai is positioned near to the user. This type of delivery method comprises dispensing the cumposition either as a series of droplets or via atomization (i.e. aerosol) onto a substrate such as the cloth of a pillow case, or a handkerchief. As used herein, "liquid" includes compositions having a viscosity of less than 10 mPa.s at 25°C. As used herein, "viscous liquid" means a liquid composition that has a viscosity of from about 10 mPa.s to about 300000 mPa.s when measured at 25°C, more prefereably from 50 mPa.s to 150 000 rnPa.s. Viscosity herein is measured on neat composition using a Brookfield RVI 'I -C Spindle at 5 rpms and Heliopath Stand. Viscous liquid compositions have a viscosity thai is greater than that of water, and typically provide improved application characteristics when compared with products having a viscosity similar to that of water when applied directly by the user using manual (i.e. hand) application. Liquid compositions are preferable when dispensed as an aerosol or droplets. Preferably the personal care compositions of the present invention are a liquid, viscous liquid or gel.<br>
