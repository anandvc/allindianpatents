FABRIC CONDITIONING COMPOSITION?<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
5  The present invention relates to fabric conditioning<br>
 compositions.  More specifically, the invention relates tc stable fabric-softening compositions comprising an ester-linked quaternary ammonium compound, a long chain fatty comnound and an inoraanic electrolvte.<br>
i r<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
It is well known to provide liquid fabric conditioning compositions, which soften in the rinse cycle.<br>
■x t<br>
Such compositions comprise less-than 7.5% by weight of softening active, in which case the composition is defined as "dilute", from 7.5% to about 30% by weight of active in which case the compositions are defined as "concentrated" or 20  more than about 30% by weight of active, in which case the composition is "defined." as "Super-conc en tratred**<br>
Concentrated and super-concentrated compositions are . desirable since these require less packaging and are 25  therefore environmentally more compatible than dilute or semi-dilute compositions.<br>
A problem known to affect concentrated and super-concentrated- fabric softening compositions is that the 30  initial viscositv of a fullv formulated .composition can be<br><br>
WO 03/022973<br><br>
PCT/EP02/09868<br><br>
-   2   -<br>
vary high-, up-to a point- that the composition forms a--gel or solid which is not dispersible or dispensable.<br>
A further problem is that, upon storage, the product is not 5  stable, especially when stored at high temperatures.<br>
Storage instability can manifest itself as a thickening of the product upon storage, again to the point that the product is no longer pourable.<br>
10  The problem of thickening upon storage is particularly apparent in concentrated and superconcentrated fabric softening compositions comprising an ester-linked quaternary ammonium fabric softening material having one or more fully saturated alkyl chains.<br>
15<br>
It is believed that compositions comprising fully saturated quaternary ammonium fabric softeners form a lamellar gel structure. This structure is characterised by stacks of alternate bilayers of the quaternary ammonium material and<br>
20  water. In compositions comprising fully saturated softeners the bilayers are'"in"a solid Lp state.<br>
When the concentration of quaternary ammonium material increases, the liquid can become very thick or can even gel. 25  It is believed that this high viscosity is due to the presence of the solid bilayers because the solid chains produce rigid droplets which occupy a larger volume hence trapping a larger amount of the external agueous phase, and because the rigid particles deform less in flow.<br><br>
WO 03/022973<br><br>
PCT/EP02/09868<br><br>
-   3   -<br>
This-problem is -typically.. not observed in compositions comprising unsaturated or partially saturated quaternary ammonium materials since the chains of the unsaturated softening materials are present in a more mobile state, 5  known as the La-state.  That is, the particles are less<br>
rigid occupying a smaller volume. As a consequence, fabric-conditioning compositions produced by using partially saturated or unsaturated actives show a lower viscosity for the same level of active as fully saturated ones.  Another 10  consequence of La-state softeners is the tendency for the compositions to be more stable in terms of long term viscosity than fully saturated softeners because the La-state particles have less tendency to aggregate.<br>
15  Thus, the problems encountered with fully saturated<br>
sofeners as identified above are not addressed in any way by compositions comprising partially saturated or fully unsaturated softening compounds.<br>
20  Nevertheless, it is desirable to use ester-linked compounds due to their inherent biodegradability and to use substantially fully saturated quaternary ammonium fabric softening compounds due to their excellent softening capabilities and because they are more stable to oxidative<br>
25  degradation (which can lead to malodour generation) than<br>
partially saturated or fully unsaturated quaternary ammonium softening compounds.<br>
Of the  types of ester-linked' quaternary ammonium materials 30  known, it is desirable to use those based on triethanolamine which produce at least some mono-ester linked component and<br><br>
WO 03/022973<br><br>
PCT/EP02/09868<br><br>
-   4   -<br>
at least some tri-ester linked component since the raw material has a low melting temperature which enables the manufacturing process of the composition to occur at low temperatures.  This reduces difficulties associated with 5  high temperature handling, transport and processing of the raw material and compositions produced therefrom.<br>
The problem of high initial viscosity and visco-stability upon storage has previously been addressed in various ways.<br>
10<br>
For instance, a first approach involves the reduction in the swelling of water layers (reduction in inter-lamellar spacing) of particles; a second approach involves the reduction in the size {number of layers) of each particle;<br>
15  and a third approach involves the combination of de-swelling and size reduction.<br>
The first approach can be delivered by using electrolytes, polyelectrolytes and solvents.  However, such compositions 20  can suffer from colloidal stability problems since it is<br>
believed that the" electrostatic charges which keep liposomes stable are shielded by the electrolyte.<br>
The second approach can be achieved by attrition of the 25  particles to smaller sizes by an input of energy such as milling or shearing. If the mechanical energy input (power/unit volume) is intense, bilayer 'pieces' or fragments may result. Fragments obtained mechanically may not be colloidally stable and can flocculate causing loss of 30  fluidity.  Also, milling or shearing products in a<br><br>
WO 03/022973<br><br>
PCT/EP02/09868<br><br>
-   5   -<br>
manufacturing process on an industrial scale is time consuming and expensive.<br>
The third approach can be delivered by using micelle-forming 5  surfactants to alter the intrinsic curvature of the<br>
quaternary ammonium fabric softening material and force it to form smaller particles - this acts as chemical energy input. The surfactants can simultaneously reduce the phase volume too.  For instance, it is known to incorporate 10  ethoxylated nonionic surfactants into fabric conditioning<br>
compositions for the purpose of stability.  However, at high temperature it is often found that thickening of the composition is not prevented.<br>
15  EP-A2-0415698 (Unilever) discloses the use of electrolytes, polyelectrolytes, or decoupling polymers to reduce the initial viscosity of fabric softening compositions.<br>
DE 2503026 (Hoechst) discloses formulations comprising 3-12% 20  of a softener (a mixture of non-ester quaternary ammonium<br>
compounds imidazoline group containing compounds), 1-6% of a cationic disinfectant, 0.1-5% of a lower alcohol, 0.5-5% of a fatty alcohol and 0-5% of a nonionic emulsifier.<br>
25  WO 99/5 0378 (Unilever) relates to compositions comprising from 1 to 8% of a quaternary ammonium compound, a stabilising agent and a fatty alcohol.  The fatty alcohol is present in order to thicken the dilute composition.  The disclosure only relates to dilute compositions and so is not<br>

10  quaternary ammonium compounds.  The compositions optionally comprise salt and ethoxylated amines.  The salt is suggested for further reduction in the initial viscosity and the ethoxylated amine for further storage stability.  None of the examples comprises electrolyte.  The viscosities are<br>
15  controlled by high-pressure homogenisation rather than by electrolyte.   Indeed the prior art review in this document teaches that the use of electrolytes is unsatisfactory in concentrated fabric conditioning compositions because they offer the initial low viscosity but cause gellation or<br>
20  severe changes in viscosity on storage (over the temperature range of from 18 to 60°C; the extremes at which fabric conditioners may be handled).<br>

The present invention seeks to address one or more of the above-mentioned problems, and, to give one or more of the above-mentioned benefits desired by consumers.<br>
15<br>
Surprisingly, the inventors have now found that, in the combined presence of an inorganic electrolyte and a fatty complexing agent, undesirably high viscosity of certain fabric conditioning compositions can not only be reduced but<br>
20  also long term storage stability can be achieved.<br>
In particular, it has been found that by incorporating a fatty component which comprises a long alkyl chain, such as fatty alcohols or fatty acids (hereinafter referred to as<br>
25  "fatty complexing agents") together with an inorganic electrolyte into softening compositions comprising a quaternary ammonium softening material having substantially fully saturated alkyl chains, at least some mono-ester linked component and at least some tri-ester linked<br>
30  component, the stability and initial viscosity of the composition can be dramatically improved.<br><br>

The iodine value of the parent fatty acyl compound or acid from which the quaternary ammonium fabric softening material is formed is from 0 to 4, preferably from 0 to 3, more preferably from 0 to 2.  Most preferably the iodine value of 5  the parent fatty acid or acyl group from which the<br>
quaternary ammonium fabric softening material is formed is from 0 to 1.  That is, it is preferred that the alkyl or alkenyl chains are substantially fully saturated.<br>
10  If there is any unsaturated quaternary ammonium fabric<br>
softening material present in the composition, the iodine value, referred to above, represents the mean iodine value of the parent fatty acyl compounds or fatty acids of all of the quaternary ammonium materials present.<br>
15<br>
In the context of the present invention, iodine value of the parent fatty acyl compound or acid from which the fabric softening material formed, is defined as the number of grams of iodine which react with 100 grams of the compound.<br>
20<br>
In the context of'the present invention, the method for calculating the iodine value of a parent fatty acyl compound/acid comprises dissolving a prescribed amount (from 0.1-3g) into about 15ml chloroform.  The dissolved parent<br>
25  fatty acyl compound/fatty acid is then reacted with 25 ml of iodine monochloride in acetic acid solution (0.1M).  To this, 20ml of 10% potassium iodide solution and about 150-ml deionised water is added. After addition of the halogen has taken place, the excess of iodine monochloride is determined<br>
30  by titration with sodium thiosulphate solution (0.1M) in the presence of a blue starch indicator powder.  At the same<br><br>

Fatty complexing agent<br>
The compositions of the present invention comprise a fatty 5  complexing agent.<br>
Without being bound by theory it is believed that the fatty complexing material improves the viscosity profile of the composition by complexing with mono-ester component of the<br>
10  fabric softening material thereby providing a composition which has relatively higher, levels of di-ester linked and tri-ester linked components.  The di-ester and tri-ester linked components are more stable and do not affect initial viscosity as detrimentally as the mono-ester component.<br>
15  Therefore, compositions already free of the mono- and tri-ester linked components do not fall within the scope of the invention.<br>
The applicants also believe that that the complexing of the 20  mono-ester linked component (which does not contribute to softening) with the* fatty complexing material thereby provides a material which does contribute to softening.<br>
Especially suitable fatty complexing agents include fatty 25  alcohols and fatty acids.  Of these, fatty alcohols are most preferred.<br>
Preferred fatty acids include hardened tallow fatty acid (available under the tradename"Pristerene, ex Uniqema) .<br><br>
WO 03/022973<br><br>
PCT/EP02/09868<br><br>
-   18   -<br>
Preferred fatty alcohols include hardened tallow alcohol (available under the tradenames Stenol and Hydrenol, ex Cognis and Laurex CS, ex Albright and Wilson) and behenyl alcohol, a C22 chain alcohol, available as Lanette 22 (ex 5     He.nke.if.<br>
The fatty complexing agent is present in an amount from 0.01% to 15% by weight based on the total weight of the composition. More preferably, the fatty component is 10  present in an amount of from 0.5 to 10%, most preferably from greater than 1.5% to 5%, e.g. 1.6 to 4% by weight, based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
The weight ratio of the mono-ester component of the 15  quaternary ammonium fabric softening material to the fatty complexing agent is preferably from 5:1 to 1:5, more preferably 4:1 to 1:4, most preferably 3:1 to 1:3, e.g. 2:1 to 1:2.<br>
2 0  Without wishing to be bound by theory, the inventors believe 'that the stabilisation of viscosity of fabric conditioners even in the presence of the electrolyte, which is known to destabilise fabric conditioning compositions, is due to the fatty complexing agent increasing the level of counter-ion<br>
25  dissociation and hence increasing electrostatic repulsion<br>
between liposomal particles such that partial shielding with an electrolyte is not detrimental to stability.<br>
30  Calculation of Mono-ester Linked Component of the Quaternary Ammonium Material<br><br>
WO 03/022973<br><br>
PCT/EP02/09868<br><br>
19   -<br>
The quantitative analysis of mono-ester linked component of the quaternary ammonium material is carried out through the use of Quantitative 13C NMR spectroscopy with inverse gated 5  XH decoupling scheme.<br>
The sample of known mass of the quaternary ammonium raw material is first dissolved in a known volume of CDC13 along with a known amount of an assay material such as<br>
10  naphthalene. A 13C NMR spectrum of this solution is then<br>
recorded using both an inverse gated decoupling scheme and a relaxation agent. The inverse gated decoupling scheme is \ used to ensure that any Overhauser effects are suppressed whilst the relaxation agent is used to ensure that the<br>
15  negative consequences of the long t1. relaxation times are<br>
overcome (i.e. adequate signal-to-noise can be achieved in a reasonable timescale).<br>
The signal intensities of characteristic peaks of both the 20  carbon atoms in the quaternary ammonium material and the naphthalene are'used to calculate the concentration of the mono-ester linked component of the quaternary ammonium material.  In the quaternary ammonium material, the signal represents the carbon of the nitrogen-methyl group on the 25  quaternary ammonium head group.  The chemical shift of the nitrogen-methyl group varies slightly due to the different degree of esterification; characteristic chemical shifts for the mono-, di- and tri-ester links are 48.28, 47.97 and 47-.76 ppm respectively. Any of the peaks due to the 3 0  napthalene carbons that are free' of interference from other<br><br>

components can then be used to calculate the mass of mono-ester linked component present in the sample as follows:-<br>
MassMQ(mg/ml) = (massNaph x IMQ X NNaph x Mm   Q)/(INaph x NMQ x MNAph)<br>
where MassMQ = mass mono-ester linked quaternary ammonium material in mg/ml, massNaph = mass naphthalene in mg/ml, I = peak intensity, N = number of contributing nuclei and M = relative molecular mass.  The relative molecular mass of naphthalene used is 12 8.17 and the relative molecular mass of the mono-ester linked component of the quaternary ammonium material is taken as 526.<br>
The weight percentage of mono-ester linked quaternary ammonium material in the raw material can thus be calculated:<br>
% of mono-ester linked quaternary ammonium material in the raw material = (massMQ / mass HT-TEA) X 100<br>
where mass HT-TEA = mass of the quaternary ammonium material and both mass MQ and mass HT-TEA are expressed as mg/ml.<br>
