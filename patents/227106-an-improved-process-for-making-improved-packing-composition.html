				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a process for making improved packing materials. This invention particularly relates to a composition of hybrid composite material for making packing rings for suspension systems. This material will be used in Railway bogies, heavy engineering industries, transport industries and automobiles as load bearing and damping material pads, blocks, and rings.<br>
Wood and natural fibre reinforced thermosetting polymer are being used as packing rings in suspension system of locomotives. Due to the poor dimensional stability under variable atmospheric conditions and the shortage of wood, it is being replaced from such applications. Dimension of wood under different climatic conditions change significantly. Wood absorbs moisture in the range of 30 -35% and shrinkage is very high in the dry conditions. It changes upto O|4% in tangential direction and upto 0.2% in the radial direction for each 1% change in moisture. Reference can be made to "Wood and Cellulose Science" by A. J. Stamm, published by Ronald Press Company, New York, 1964, and "Principles of Wood Science and Technology, vol.1, Springer - Verlag, New York Inc. New York 1968 and also in Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, vol 24, pages 579 - 610, John Willey and Sons, New York, 1984. Natural fibre reinforced composites have a problem of moisture absorption and therefore mechanical properties detonate with time. Natural fibres absorb moisture, change their dimensions, which causes internal stresses, and reduce the mechanical properties of composites. Andrei<br><br>
Hododi has claimed such composite containing 35 - 60% lignocellulosic fibre, 5 -35% lime stone, 5 - 30% resin binder such as Malamine formaldehyde, Polyvinyl alcohol etc. and 5-15% fire proofing material to make composites (US patent 05502088). Till Grether claims a process for wood substitute by using two natural fibres of 2 -150 mm length and binded with polymers and filled with fine powder (US patent 5415736). These along with some other developments in the related field such as US patent 5518802,5656008 etc. are not able to provide a composition with good dimensional stability under different climatic conditions. Another material is ultra high molecular weight polyethylene powder (UHMWPE) which is used for such applications. However, the processing of this thermoplastic is very difficult. This is moulded by using sintering process. Powder of UHMWPE is weighed, pressed and heated at 150°C for 30 minutes. This process consumes a lot of time and high pressure and therefore is very costly. Reference can be made to "Wear" vol. 153, (1992) 331 - 350 wherein T. S. Barrett, G. W. Stachowiak, A. W. Batehelor mentioned the viscosity of molten UHMWPE is so high that it is effectively solid and does not flow.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a process for making<br>
improved packing material and packing material made therefrom.<br>
The another objective of this invention is to provide a composition of<br>
lignocelloulosic fibre, a fraction of fibre reinforced plastic (FRP) waste, a particulate filler and polymer for making hybrid composite which obviate the drawbacks as detailed above.<br><br>
Another objective of present invention is to provide a process for making packing pads and rings by using above composition.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for making improved packing material which comprises mixing lignocellulosic fibre 10 to 60 wt%, thermosetting resin 8 to 60wt%, fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) waste 5 to 50wt%, paniculate filler 0 - 40%, additive 0.5 to 3wt% in a mixer having blades rotating at a speed of 8 - 200 rpm, for the time ranging from 15 minutes to 100 minutes to obtain a homogeneous dough, transferring the dough to a preheated metallic moulds maintained at a temperature in the range of 100 to 140°C, subjecting the said mould to a pressure in the range of 10 - 1000 kgf/cm2 for a period in the range of 5 minutes to 50 minutes, post cured the article so obtained in an oven at a temperature in the range of 80 to 120°C for a period in the range of 1 hour to 24 hours, and thereafter allowing the moulded item to cool at room temperature .<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the lignocellulosic fibre may be selected from sisal, jute, sun hemp and banana or a mixture of two fibres in the ratio of 0.1-10.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the thermosetting polymer used may be selected from phenol formaldehyde, unsaturated polyester, epoxy resin, poly amides, melamine formaldehyde and polyurethane resin systems.<br>
In still another embodiment of the invention, the fraction of FRP waste useful in this composition may be obtained from the waste generated during<br>
machining, polishing, cutting, and fabrication of FRP items such as insulation boxes, printed circuit board, sheets, blocks, insulators, covers, frames etc. and may be preferably used in the size ranging from powder to fibres up to 25 mm length and/or the pieces of FRP upto 1 cm3 volume which can be separated from the bulk waste by screening, hand sorting, gravity separation method.<br>
In another embodiment the particulate filler may be selected from red mud, fly ash, saw dust, silica, Calcium carbonate and talc or a mixture of two fillers in a ratio of 0.1 to 10.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention the additive used may be selected from benzoyl peroxide, methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) peroxide, and preferably used in the range of 0.5 to 3% of resin with or without accelerator selected from cobalt naphthanate or alkyl mercaptans in the range 0 to 1.5% of resin.<br>
The detailed process steps of present invention are:<br>
a)	The ingredients lignocellulosic fibres, FRP waste, particulate filler are dried<br>
at a temperature in the range of 50 - 80°C for a period of 45 to 120 minutes.<br>
b)	The dried ingredients obtained in step a) are mixed in a mixer with<br>
thennosetting resin and additive in the composition range to obtain dough<br>
like consistency.<br>
c)	This dough like material obtain in step b) is transferred to the mould<br>
preheated to a temperature in the range of 100 to 140°C, maintaining the<br><br>
said mould temperature and subjecting the pressure in the range of 10 to 1000 kg f/cm2 for 5 to 50 minutes.<br>
d)	Post curing of the article obtains in step c) at a temperature in the range of 80 to<br>
120°C for a period in the range of 1 hour to 24 hours.<br>
e)	Allowing the article cool at room temperature.<br>
The novelty and inventive steps of composition useful for making packing material resides in the material selection consisting lignocellulsic fibre, a component from FRP waste, filler and polymer.<br>
The following examples are given by the way of illustration and therefore should not construed to limit the scope of present invention.<br>

Lignocellulosic jute fibre was cut to the size (approximately 5mm long) in a fibre cutting machine. The jute fibre obtained after cutting is then mixed with the FRP machining waste in the above proportion. Then approximately half of this mixture is taken in a mechanical mixer and unsaturated polyester resin containing 2% hardener (MEK peroxide) is added to the above mixture and mixed thoroughly in a sigma mixer. The remaining mix of jute fibre and FRP waste is then added in a small quantity in many steps until it is totally consumed in the above resin mixture. The mixture finally prepared is called "Dough".<br>
The dough prepared by above process is then weighed and spread uniformly in a mould. The dough is then pressed with punch in the mould with 15 kg/sq. cm pressure. The temperature of mould is kept 120°C. The heating is carried out for 12 minutes at the same temperature and pressure mentioned above. After 12 minutes, the sample is taken out of the mould. Post curing of rings are carried out at 120°C for 2 hours. Machining and grinding of sample is done to get the desired size. This is a known compression moulding process.<br>
Packing rings for suspension system were made by using the same dough. The die/mould for the packing ring was made by using stainless steel with a mirror finish surface. 13-mm thick packing rings having 254-mm outer diameter and 120 mm inner diameter were fabricated as mentioned above.<br><br>

Then approximately half of this mixture is taken in a mechanical mixer and unsaturated polyester resin containing 2% hardener is added to the above mixture and mixed thoroughly in a mechanical/sigma mixer. The remaining mix of jute fibre, redmud, calcium carbonte and FRP waste is then added in a small quantity in few steps until it is totally consumed in the above resin mixture. The mixture finally prepared is called "Dough".<br>

These examples clearly indicate that the material produced by this composition is superior to the wood as well as fibre reinforced thermosetting materials. The water retention is very low as compared to 30% of wood. Consequently, the dimensional stability at different conditions would be superior.<br>
The composition prepared is not a mere admixture resulting in mere aggregation but is a synergistic mixture resulting in improved mechanical properties as can be seen above explained.<br>
