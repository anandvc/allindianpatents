				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of ultrathin nanofilms of metals. The thickness of the films prepared by the process of the present invention is in the range of 30-500 A0. The films formed co.uld have various applications such as corrosion resistance coating, antireflection coating, surface passivation coating, non linear optics (NLO), catalysis, solar energy utilization etc.<br>
The conventional methods employed for the formation of ultra-thin films of metals are :<br>
(1)	Vacuum Evaporation Technique (VE)<br>
(2)	Glow Dishcarge Technologies (Sputtering)<br>
(3)	Plasma processes<br>
(4)	Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD)<br>
(5)	Electro plating<br>
(6)	Modified Langmuir Blodgett method<br>
The above mentioned methods and their drawbacks are discussed below.<br>
1. Vacuum Evaporative Technologies :- The substance of which a nanofilm is to be deposited is generated in vapour state by boiling, sublimating or vapourizing by giving sufficient energy by heating, electron beam bombardment, lasers or any other energy source. In the second step vapour is transported to substrate without any chemical change occuring in the<br>
substance and in the last step, the substance is allowed to condense / dcpositc on substrate surface such as glass/ quartz plate, silicon wafer etc. This is a common technology for metal thin film deposition. Drawbacks - High vacuum is required. Some chemical changes in substance composition is quite common such as nonstoichiometry or contamination from source container. For the uniform and adherent films to be obtained, the number of parameters are large and therefore process monitoring and control is needed. It is difficult to achieve nanoparticles in the resulting films prepared by this method.<br>
Molecular beam epitaxy :- It is an improved technology over vacuum evaporation mainly used for growing single crystalline films (very ordered films) on single crystal substrates.<br>
Drawback    :-        The cost and number of parameters are increased many folds. The operation is complex and throughput is very low.<br>

b)	Thin film phenomenon<br>

McGraw - Hill Book Co. New York USA (1969).<br>
2.	Glow discharge technologies (Sputtering):- The ejection of surface atoms<br>
from an electrode surface by momentum tumsfer from bombarding ion is<br>
called sputtering. In other words, during sputtering process,'source of<br>
electrode material in vapour form is made available, which is used for thin<br>
film formation as in vacuum evaporation.<br>
There are various ways in which basic process is modified. AC sputtering, bias sputtering, magnetron sputtering are often used modifications.<br>
Drawback :- The main drawback is contamination problem. Also, the equipment is sophisticated and very costly. The films obtained by this method do not consist of nanosized particles.<br>

(1988) b) Thin film phenomenon<br>
K. L. Chopra.<br>
McGraw - Hill Book Co. New York USA (1969).<br>
3.	Plasma processes :- Some chemical reactions are accelerated in presence<br>
of bombarding reactive ions. Therefore, the electrode material (metal) in<br>
presence of gases like O2, N2+H2, CH4 forming a glow discharge forms a<br>
film of metal oxide, carbide, nitride on the substrate surface which on further processing can give metal films. The plasma can be generated by means of discharge in vacuum, electron bumbardment, cyclotron -resonance etc.<br>
Drawback:- The drawbacks of this process is again high cost equipment. Also limited number of reactions can be carried out and thin films of compounds formed by this method need further processing to get metal films. Films with nano sized particle cannot be obtained.<br>

b)	Thin film phenomenon<br>
K. L. Chopra.<br>

4. Chemical vapour deposition :- In this method the constituents of vapour phase are made to react near or on the substrate surface where the solid product is obtained in thin film form. Since large number of reactions are available, CVD is versatile and flexible technique in producing variety of products in thin film form including metals, semiconductors, insulators.<br>
Metal organics, inorganic compounds of metals having high vapour pressure like metal carbonyls are very convenient for CVD application as relatively low temperatures, can transform them in vapour phase. This, therefore has become a main modification of CVD called MOCVD.<br>
As a modification of CVD, other energy sources' assistance is taken to carry out reactions by increasing the reaction rates. The lasers, photons (light) are utilized for this purpose.<br>
Drawback :- Although the chemistry part of CVD appears to be simple, the monitoring of many parameters is needed to achieve films of good quality. The process, therefore, becomes technically complicated and critical. Also, thickness and material particle size control in the film is difficult.<br>

(1988) b) Thin film phenomenon K. L. Chopra. McGraw - Hill Book Co. New York USA (1969).<br>
5. Electroplating :- When a current is passed through a conducting solution (electrolyte) and suitable reactions are taking place at either cathode i.e.<br>
negative electrode or anode i.e. positive electrode, it is possible to employ this method in depositing thin films on conducting substrates. By controlling the pH, current density (current / area of electrode ), temperature, composition of electrolyte, it is possible to get uniform films of metals,some metal oxides, chalcogenides etc.<br>
Drawbacks :- Films are obtained only on the conducting substrates. Also, the contamination is a common problem as many reactions can take place simultaneously. Films are not constitutaed with nanosized particles.<br>

6. Modified Langmuir Bloduett (LB) method<br>
In a modification of LB method, ultra fine particles of a substance of which thin film is to be obtained, are given special chemical treatment so that particles get imcoagulative character. These particles are spread using suitable organic solvent on aqueous subphase as in the conventional LB<br>
technique. The film formed at the interface is subsequently collected on the substrate.<br>
In another modification the particles of the substance of which film is to be formed are obtained in a colloidal state. This colloidal solution is used as subphase over which fatty acid/ amine is spread using conventional LB technique. The particles in the colloidal state are bonded to the fatty acid/amine film formed at the interface which is collected on the substrate.<br>
Drawbacks :A special chemical treatement is necessary to use conventional LB procedure for metal film formation. This increases the number of steps in film formation procedure.<br>
