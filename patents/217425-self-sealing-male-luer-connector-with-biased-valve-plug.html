The present invention generally relates to medical connectors used in<br>
conducting fluids and more specifically to self-sealing male Luer connectors.<br>
The self-sealing Luer connectors presently known and used in the art are<br>
generally designed to be connected to a patient's intravenous ("IV") or gas<br>
sampling line, drug or solution source, or other medical device such that the<br>
connector's seal operates to trap all Quid on the side of the connector toward the<br>
patient in the case of an TV line or other device such, as a fluid bag in the case of a<br>
fluid source. In the case of some connectors, the connector has an unsealed male<br>
Luer connector on one end that retrains connected to the patient's IV line, fluid<br>
source or other device and a self-sealing female connector on the opposite free end<br>
of the connector through which a syringe or other such device may be engaged. In<br>
the case of other connectors, the connector does not have a separate male connector<br>
end but is instead a permanent part of the line or source.<br>
In use, tbe syringe or other device having a male connector is connected to<br>
the female end of the connector to push or pull fluids through the connector, as<br>
when medications are dispensed within a patient's IV line. The syringe or ather<br>
device is configured with a male Luer connector so as to engage the self-sealing<br>
female connector and cause the male Luer's central boss to contact the female<br>
Luer's seal memhrane, opening the slit formed in the membrane and creating a fluid<br>
path through the connector. After the necessary fluids have been dispensed or<br>
withdrawn, the syringe is removed and the slit in the needle-free connector's seal<br>
membrane closes to reseal the female connector and trap all bodily fluids, including<br>
any just-dispensed medications, on the patient side of the connector.<br>
Therefore, the bodily fluids are sealed off within the self-sealing Luer<br>
connector toward the patient and away from the care giver, preventing any escape<br>
of the fluids and protecting bath the patient and the care giver from possible<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2004/060474	PCT/US2003/040966<br>
dangerous contamination. However, the free end of the syringe and any residual<br>
fluids remaining therein are unsealed and exposed. Rattier than the self-sealing,<br>
needle-free connectors known in the art remaining attached to the syringe to trap<br>
any and all residual fluids within the syringe, they remain on the destination or<br>
source connector to trap all residual fluids there instead.<br>
While these prior art self-sealing, needle-free Luer connectors generally<br>
adequately serve their Intended purpose of providing a. sealed, needle-free<br>
connection that remains on a patient interface or the like and allows for the<br>
connection of a sitings or other such device to dispense or extract fluids, it is clear<br>
that these connectors are not designed to remain on and seal off the syringe itself<br>
before and after use and are not used for such a purpose. Moreover, while this<br>
function is not necessarily required in the typical drug dispensing application, there<br>
arc other application in which the fluid being dispensed from or drawn into the<br>
syringe must itself be at all times sealed off and exposure to such fluid by a care<br>
giver or patient prevented or at least minimized. For this purpose, a different self-<br>
sealing, needle-free Luer connector design is necessary.<br>
Specifically, in the area of nuclear medicine where radioactive isotopes are<br>
administered to patients, it is critical that exposure to the isotopes be minimized for<br>
the safety of both the care giver and the patient. Yet, with the existing connectors<br>
known and used in the art, the isotope may be sealed off while still in its vial or<br>
other container prior to administration and may be sealed off on the patient side by<br>
the typical self-scaling, needle-free connector after administration, as discussed<br>
above, but the syringe or other device used to transfer the isotope from its container<br>
to the patient during administration is unsealed and allows exposure to the isotope.<br>
Similarly, in collecting blood from a patient, the typical blood collection<br>
device known and used in the art has on one end an unsealed male Luer connector<br>
for attaching to the conventional female Luer connector on a patient's IV line. On<br>
the device's opposite end there is configured a needle having a resilient sleeve and<br>
surrounded by an elongate tubular shield. In use, the blood collection device's male<br>
 Luer connector is connected to the TV life's female Luer connector, which starts the<br>
flow of blood through the connectors and into the needle. The sleeve covering the<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2004/060474	PCT/US2003/040966<br>
needle prevents the unwanted escape of any blood until a vacuum blood collection<br>
tube is inserted into the blood collection device's tubular shield. The collection<br>
tube is formed at its free end with a rubber stopper or septum that, upon insertion<br>
into the shield, pushes back the resilient sleeve covering the needle while the needle<br>
itself penetrates the septum and enters the tube, allowing the flow of blood through<br>
the blood collection device and into the vacuum collection tube. When the desired<br>
quantity of blood has been collected, the collection tube is removed from the<br>
device, allowing the resilient sleeve to expand back over the needle in covering<br>
relationship and to, again, prevent tbe further flow of blood from the patient<br>
through the connectors. As such, the blood collection device remains connected to<br>
the IV line and thereby seals off any residual blood remaining therein.<br>
	However, it is likely that at some point it will be desirable to remove the<br>
blood collection device from the TV line female connector, as when medicines are<br>
to be administered through the connector as discussed above, In this case, because<br>
the male Luer connector end of the conventional blood collection device is not seif-<br>
sealing, the residual biood within the device will then be exposed to the care giver<br>
and others at the male Luer end when the device is disconnected. Moreover, there<br>
are other blood collection applications known in the art in which it is desirable to be<br>
able to leave the vacuum collection tube connected to the blood collection device,<br>
or even have the collection tube permanently mounted in the device, in which case,<br>
after the required quantity of blood has been collected, the male LUCE connector end<br>
of the blood collection device must be disconnected from the female Luer connector<br>
of the patient's IV line. Again, with the typical blood collection device, this<br>
presents a hazard to the cane giver, as tbe collection device's male Luer is unsealed<br>
and disconnection may expose the care giver to blood remaining within the device.<br>
	Yet a further example is in the oncology area where certain drugs have great<br>
beneficial effect when confined to the circulatory system of a patient, yet are<br>
harmful to the skin or other tissue of a patient Such drugs must be carefully<br>
controlled so that they do not reach tissues that may be harmed Transferring such<br>
drugs fiom one container to another or to the patient's fluid line can be hazardous if<br>
seals are not present<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2004/060474	PCT/US2003/040966<br>
Hence, those skilled in the art have recognized a need for a self-sealing male<br>
connector that may be connected to a. syringe or other such device or formed on a<br>
blood collection device to seal residual fluids therein before and after<br>
connection to a female connector. The present invention fulfills this need and<br>
others.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Briefly and in general terms, the present invention is directed in a connecter<br>
comprising a male connector body having a proximal end and a distal end with a<br>
How path opening at the distal end and an internal flow passage connected with the<br>
flow path openings a valve element disposed within the mate connector body in the<br>
internal flow passage and movable between a flow stop position at which the valve<br>
element seals the flow path opening against fluid flow and a flow position at which<br>
the valve element is removed from the flow path opening thereby allowing flow<br>
through the opening, and a valve element control device disposed external to the<br>
male connector body adjacent the proximal end of the male connector body and<br>
being movable towards the proximal end to control movement of the valve element<br>
to the flow position and being movable toward the distal end to control movement<br>
of the valve element to the flow stop position.<br>
In more detailed aspects, the valve element seals the flow path opening from<br>
the internal flow passage inside the male connector body. The connector further<br>
comprises a base external to the male connector body and protruding outwards at<br>
the proximal end of the male connector body, the valve element control device<br>
extending through the bass toward the distal end. The connector further comprises<br>
a biasing device disposed at the base so as to bias the valve element control device<br>
to control the valve element to the flow stop position. Further the biasing device<br>
comprises a spring disposed so as to provide a biasing force to the valve element<br>
control device to control the valve element to move to the flow stop position. In<br>
more detail, the biasing device comprises an elastomeric material connected both to<br>
the base and to the valve element control device. The elastomeric material of the<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2004/060474	PCT/US2003/040966<br>
biasing device also seals the base where the valve element control device extends<br>
through the base against fluid flow through the base.<br>
In other aspects, the connector further comprises a biasing device disposed<br>
so as to bias the valve element to the flow stop position. The connector further<br>
comprises a cuff located about the male connector body, the cuff having internal<br>
threads, whereby by means of the threads a female connector may be threaded Into<br>
engagement with the male connector body and thereby held in engagement<br>
In yet further detailed aspects, the connector further comprises a second<br>
connector disposed at the proximal end of the of the male connector body, the<br>
second connector having a second connector internal flow passage connected with<br>
the male connector body internal flow passage such that fluid may flow between the<br>
male connector body and the second connector. The second connector comprises a<br>
female connector disposed at the proximal end of the of the male connector body,<br>
the female connector having a female connector internal flow passage connected<br>
with the male connector body internal flow passage such that fluid may flow<br>
between the male connector body and the female connector.<br>
In more detail, the male connector body has an external male Luer tapered<br>
shape. The female connector has an internal female Luer tapered shape.<br>
In yet other aspects, the invention is directed to a self-sealing male Luer<br>
connector for needle-free connection to the female Luer connector of a patient's IV<br>
line or other such medical device. The male Luer connector includes a housing<br>
having a central distally-projecting tubular male body and an outer cuff<br>
interconnected along a proximal housing wall so as to form a distally-opening<br>
cavity configured for receipt of the female Luer connector. The male body is<br>
formed with an internal bore or flow passage within which a vaive plug is slidably<br>
installed. The valve plug is generally formed with a central lengthwise stem having<br>
a distal head configured to sealingly engage the distal end of the flow passage so as<br>
to selectively prevent fluid flow through the connector At the opposite, proximal<br>
end of the valve plug, at least one upwardly-turned activation arm is configured so<br>
as to project distaily into the cavity through an activation opening formed in the<br>
housing wall. An elastomeric sealing device is configured within the activation<br>
5<br><br>
WO 2004/060474	PCT/US2003/040966<br>
opening around the activation arm in order to hold the valve plug in place within<br>
the bousing and. bias the valve plug distally into sealing engagement with the male<br>
body's internal flow passage.<br>
In a detailed aspect of the present invention, the internal flow passage<br>
through the tubular mate body is formed with an annular inside surface that<br>
terminates distally in aproximally-facing nesting shoulder defining a central<br>
annular flow passage opening. The valve plug's distal head is formed with a<br>
distally-facing surface configured to engage the shoulder in surface-to-surface<br>
sealing contact.<br>
In a more detailed aspect, the nesting shoulder is configured as a radially-<br>
inwardly-angled frusto-conical surface and the distally-racing surface of the head is<br>
configured as a corresponding frosto-conical surface.<br>
In another more detailed aspect, the annular inside surface of the flow<br>
passage is distally-tapered. As such, the distal head of the valve plug is fanned<br>
will a generally straight-walled side surface configured to provide clearance<br>
between the head and the flow passage inside surface when the valve plug is shifted<br>
proximally to unseat the distal head from the distal end of the flow passage.<br>
In a related more detailed aspect, the annular inside surface of the flow<br>
passage is substantially straight-walled, and the distal head is formed with<br>
lengthwise, spaced-apart ribs to space the head from the flow passage' s inside<br>
surface and provide a flow path therebetween.<br>
In another detailed aspect of the present invention, the valve plug is formed<br>
at its proximal end with a base interconnecting the stem and the activation arm, the<br>
plug being configured such that the activation arm then protrudes disially through<br>
the activation opening substantially parallel to the stem when the plug is slidably<br>
received within the housing.<br>
In a more detailed aspect, the valve plug stem is configured having a<br>
sufficient length to space the base from the proximal housing wall so as to provide<br>
for fluid flow through the flow passage around the base. Further, the stem's outside<br>
diameter is less than the annular inside surface of the flow passage so as to allow<br>
flow thereabout.<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2004/060474	PCT/US2003/040966<br>
In another more detailed aspect, the male Luer connector is configured with<br>
two substantially opposite activation openings in the homing base and the valve<br>
plug is configured with two corresponding activation aims. In this way, the base<br>
formed at the proximal end. of the valve plug is configured as an elongate bar<br>
positioned so as to extend symmetrically in opposite directions from the proximal<br>
end of the stem so as to form to opposite bar ends from which the respective<br>
activation arms project distally through the activation openings and into the cavity.<br>
In yet another more detailed aspect, the valve plug way be formed as a<br>
single, unitary structure from a rigid thermoplastic material.<br>
In a related more detailed aspect, the valve plug may be formed from a stem<br>
made of a rigid thermoplastic and a head made of a resilient material and<br>
configured to be mounted on the distal end of the stem.<br>
In another detailed aspect of the male Luer connector of the present<br>
invention, the elastomeric device is an elastomeric sealing material bonded within<br>
the activation opening about the activation arm,<br>
In a more detailed aspect, the elastomeric material is an ultraviolet cured<br>
acrylic.<br>
In a further more detailed aspect, the activation opening In the housing's<br>
proximal wall is formed with a radially-inwardly projecting annular flange such that<br>
the elastomeric device encapsulates the flange when configured within the<br>
activation opening so as to anchor the device therein, thereby allowing the<br>
elastomeric device to seaiingly and flexibly engage the activation arm and operably<br>
allow the activation arm to shift proximally with the proximal movement of a<br>
female Luer connector being inserted onto the male Luer connector of the present<br>
invention to, in turn, cause the valve plug to shift proximally to open the flow<br>
passage.<br>
In another detailed aspect of the present invention, the housing cuff<br>
surrounding the male body is configured with internal threads to threadably engage<br>
the external thread portions formed on the female Luer connector so as to secure the<br>
 connection and prevent inadvertent disengagement<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2004/060474	PCT/US2003/040966<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, a conventional female Luer<br>
connector is configured at the male Luer connector's proximal end so that the self-<br>
sealing male Luer connector may be mounted on a syringe in the typical fashion by<br>
threadably connecting the proximal female Luer connector to the distal end of the<br>
syringe. In another aspect, a blood collection device is formed on the proximal end<br>
of the male Luer connector so as to accommodate the typical vacuumized blood<br>
collection vial with pierceable septum, With the male Luer connector so<br>
configured, the distally-biased internal valve plug remains in its al-rest, distal<br>
position sealing off the flow passage and preventing the unwanted escape of any<br>
fluids from the connector and the device to which it is connected proximal]y. Then,<br>
when the distal male Luer connector is connected to the female Luer connector of<br>
Lhe patient's IV interface, the valve plug's activation arm is engaged by the<br>
proximal end of the female Luer connector to shift the valve plug proximally,<br>
thereby unseating the valve plug from the distal end of the flow passage and<br>
allowing fluid flow through the connector.<br>
In a more detailed aspect, the male body and the valve plug are configured<br>
such that the exterior cross-section of the male body sealingly engages the interior<br>
cross-section of the female Luer connector's tubular barrel as the barrel contacts the<br>
valve plug's activation arm to shift the valve plug proximally, tons causing the<br>
female Luer connector to be effectively sealingly connected to the male Luer<br>
connector before the flow passage is opened.<br>
In a related more detailed aspect, if the female Luer connector is configured<br>
with a self-sealing internal piston, the male body and valve plug cooperate to<br>
activate the piston and allow flow through the female Liter connector after the male<br>
and female connectors have sealingly engaged along their respective tapered<br>
surfaces but before the valve plug is shifted proximally with further proximal<br>
movement of the female connector to open the flow passage through the male<br>
connector.<br>
These and other features and advantages of the present invention will<br>
 become apparent from the following detailed description of the preferred<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
As shown in the drawings for purposes of illustration wherein lite reference<br>
numerals designate corresponding or like elements among the several views, and in<br>
the simplified pictorial illustmtion of FIG-1, there is shown a connector 19 having a<br>
self-sealing male connector or fitting 20 mounted on the distal end of a syringe 22<br>
and operably connected to the proximal end of a female connector 26 configured on<br>
a patient IV interface 24 for the administration or withdrawal of fluids through the<br>
IV line 25. It should be noted that here, and throughout, "distal" refers to the<br>
direction toward the patient and "proximal" refers to the direction away from the<br>
patient, or toward the syringe or other collection or dispensing device.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, there is shown a perspective view, partially in section,<br>
of an exemplary embodiment of the connector 19 of FIG. 1 having a self-sealing<br>
male connector 20 which in this case is a male Luer connector. The male Luer<br>
connector includes a housing 40 having a centraJ distally-projecting tubular male<br>
body 42 and an outer cuff 52 interconnected with the male body by a base 56 at the<br>
proximal end 27 of the male body 42 so as to form a distally-opening cavity 61<br>
configured for receiving a female Luer connector, such as the connector 26 shown<br>
in FIG-3.<br>
10<br><br>
WO 2004/060474	PCT/US2003/040966<br>
The male body is formed with an internal flow passage or bore 46 Within<br>
which, a valve element, which in this embodiment comprises a valve plug 70, is<br>
slidably installed. The valve plug is generally formed with a central lengthwise<br>
stem 72 having a distal head 75 configured to sealingly engage the distal end of the<br>
flow passage that forms a flow passage opening 21 located at the distal end of the<br>
male body so as to selectively prevent fluid flow through the connector. At the<br>
opposite, proximal end of the valve plug 70, at least one upwardly-turned activation<br>
arm 78 is configured so as to project distally into the cavity 61 through an<br>
activation opening 58 (shown in FIG. 3.) formed in the base 56. An elastomeric<br>
sealing device 90 is configured within the activation opening around the activation<br>
arm in order to hold the valve plug in place within the housing and bias the valve<br>
plug distally into sealing engagement with the male body's internal flow passage.<br>
In the case of the connector 19 embodiment of FIG. 2, a conventional female<br>
Luer connector 94 is formed at the proximal end 27 of the male body 42. The<br>
female Luer connector includes thread elements 100. It should be appreciated<br>
however that a variety of other connectors and devices, such as a shielded blood<br>
collection, cannula device 95 (shown in FIG. 10), may be employed. As discussed<br>
more fully below, when the connector 19 having the self-sealing male Luer<br>
connector 20 of the present embodiment is mounted on a syringe 22 in the typical<br>
fashion by threadably connecting the proximal female Luer connector 94 to the<br>
male distal end of the syringe, so long as the distal male Luer connector is not<br>
connected to a female Luer connector, fee valve plug 70 remains in its at-rest, flow<br>
stop, distal position at which it seals off the flow passage and prevents the<br>
unwanted escape of any fluids within the connector 19 and the syringe to which it is<br>
mounted (FIG. 1).<br>
Referring further to FIG. 2, the activation arm 78 projecting distally from the<br>
proximal end of the valve plug 70 is shown as extending into the female Luer<br>
connector-receiving cavity 61 beyond the elastomeric sealing device 90 so that the<br>
distal end 79 of the arm is exposed. It will be appreciated that as a female Luer<br>
connector 26 (for example, that shown in FIG. 3) is inserted onto the male body 42<br>
and advanced proximally (in the proximal direction), the proximal end of the<br>
11<br><br>
WO 2004/060474	PCT/US2003/040966<br>
female connector will come into contact with. the distal cad 79 of the arm. Then,<br>
further proximal movement of the female connector onto the male connector to<br>
fully seat will, in turn, proximally shift the valve phig through engagement of the<br>
activation arm with the female connector. As explained in detail below, proximal<br>
movement of the valve plug against the biasing force of the elastomeric device<br>
serves to unseat the valve plug's distal head from the distal end or flow passage<br>
opening 21 of the flow passage 46. Because, as shown, the valve plug stem 72 is<br>
narrow relative to the flow passage bore, once the male and female connectors are<br>
connected and the valve plug has shifted proximally to unseat the head and open the<br>
flow passage opening, fluid can flow around the stem and through the connectors.<br>
In this way, the self-sealing male Luer connector 20 closes and prevents flow<br>
therethrough when disconnected from a. female connector, or the like, while it opens<br>
to a How positron and allows How during connection. It will be appreciated by<br>
those skilled in the art that the male Luer connector is thus configured to be both<br>
self-sealing and to allow needleless connection to a female Luer connector, thereby<br>
protecting both the care giver and the patient from dangerous cross-contamination<br>
before, during and after use.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 3, there is shown a partial cross-sectional view of the<br>
exemplary embodiment of the self-sealing male Luer connector 20 of the connector<br>
19 of FIG. 2. As best shown in this view, the central lengthwise stem 72 of the<br>
valve plug 70 is positioned substantially coaxially within the flow passage 46 and<br>
terminates proximally in a linkage 82 defining a horizontal bar S3 on which are<br>
mounted one or more activation arms 73 at the respective opposite bar ends 534.<br>
Thus, the cross-section of the valve plug is generally an upside-down capital "T".<br>
The valve plug may then be fonned with two substantially opposite activation arms<br>
configured to extend parallel to the stem from opposite ends of the linkage and to<br>
be aligned with and project distally through two corresponding activation holes 58<br>
formed in the base 56. In this way, when a female Luer connector 26 is inserted<br>
onto the male Luer connector, as explained more fully below, the forces serving to<br>
1 shift the valve plug proximally are substantially symmetrical and balanced so as to<br>
12<br><br>
WO 2004/060474	PCT/US2003/040966<br>
obtain smooth, linear translation of the valve plug and, specifically, of each<br>
activation arm within its respective activation opening.<br>
Each activation opening 58 may be defined by a radially-inwardly projecting<br>
annular flange 59 on which the elastomeric device 90 seats. In the exemplary<br>
embodiment, the flange is essentially formed by configuring the activation opening<br>
inside diameter to be smaller man the transverse dimension of the closed end of the<br>
distally-facing cavity 61 (FIG- 2) defined as the difference between the nominal<br>
inside diameter of me housing cuff 52 and the outside diameter of the proximal end<br>
of the male body 42, By providing such a flange about each activation opening, it<br>
will be appreciated that the elastomeric sealing device can be configured to<br>
completely encapsulate the flange as it seals around the activation arm so as to<br>
effectively anchor the device within the activation spacing. In so doing, the<br>
elastomeric device serves to bond the valve plug 70 to the housing 40, to seal the<br>
activation, openings in the housing wall about the activation aims, and to provide a<br>
biasing spring force to keep the valve plug seated distally within the flow passage.<br>
To achieve this function, the etastomeric device may consist of an elastomeric<br>
sealing material 91 such as Loctite® 3103 ultraviolet cured acrylic deposited within<br>
each activation opening while the respective activation arm is in position- Once<br>
cured, the elastomeric material has a high bond strength but allows substantial<br>
elongation so as to accommodate temporary proximal displacement of the valve<br>
plug during use of the maleLuer connector. It also acts as a spring to bias the valve<br>
plug back to the flow stop position shown, in FIG. 3.<br>
With continued reference to FIG. 3, the flow passage 46 formed through the<br>
tubular male body 42 is shown in the exemplary embodiment male Luer connector<br>
20 as having a distallytapered annular inside surface 47 terminating distally in a<br>
radially-inward, proxhtially-facing nesting shoulder 49 so as to define a central flow<br>
passage opening 48 and act as a valve seat As such, the distal head 75 of the valve<br>
plug 70 is configured to seat against the shoulder so as to achieve a surface-to-<br>
surface seal when the valve plug is forced mto contact with the shoulder by a<br>
 biasing device such as elastomeric device 90. As clearly shown in the view of FIG.<br>
3, the valve plug's stem is configured with an outside diameter that is smaller than<br>
13<br><br>
WO 2004/060474	PCT/US2003/040966<br>
the nominal inside diameter of the flow passage so as to provide an annular space<br>
through which fluid can flow around the stem when the valve is opened. The stem<br>
is further formed having a sufficient length 10 space the valve plug's base 82 away<br>
from the proximally-facing surface of the housing wall 56 to provide clearance for<br>
the elastomeric device to fully seat about the annular flange 59 of the activation<br>
opening and to allow fluid flow around the base through the flow passage.<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the configuration of the<br>
housing 40 shown in FIGS- 2 and 3 is well-saited for the injection molding<br>
manufacturing process, whereby the housing may be made in a relatively simple<br>
two-half mold cavity with a single core pull. Because the design of the housing is<br>
particularly suited to injection molding, then, it may be formed from a variety of<br>
plastic materials such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polycarbonate, PVC, ABS,<br>
acrylic and K-resin. Similarly, the valve plug 70 is also conveniently fabricated<br>
using a conventional injection molding process as is known and practiced in the art<br>
and thus may also be formed from a wide variety of plastics. As such, the male<br>
Luer connector is readily manufacturable with few moving parts. While a<br>
particular configuration of the housing and the valve plug having a pair of opposite<br>
respective activation openings 58 and arms 78 has been shown and described, it will<br>
be appreciated that various other configurations, such as an increased number of<br>
activation openings and arms spaced about the housing or various cross-sectional<br>
configurations for the openings and arms, may be employed without departing from<br>
the scope of the present invention.<br>
Still referring to FIG. 3, the conventional female Luer connector 94 that is<br>
disposed at the proximal end of the male connector body and which extends<br>
proximally from the male Luer connector's housing 40 is shown in the exemplary<br>
embodiment as a separate component having its distal end press-fit within the<br>
housing's proximal end It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the<br>
female Luer connector, like the housing and the valve plug 70, may be formed<br>
through an injection molding process and subsequently installed on the housing<br>
using a variety of assembly techniques now known or later developed in the art,<br>
including a press- or interference-fit, solvent bonding, or ultrasonic welding. As<br>
14<br><br>
WO 2004/060474	PCT/US2003/040966<br>
shown, the housing is of sufficient length proximal of the housing wall 56 such that<br>
the female Luer connector or other medical device can be installed proximally<br>
while leaving enough space between the distal end of the female Luer connector<br>
and the base 82 of the valve plug bo allow the valve plug to translate proximally<br>
when the male Luer connector is connected to a patients IV interface female<br>
connector 26 during use for example. Relatedly, it will be appreciated that the<br>
distal end 36 of the female Luer connector 94 may be configured to support a<br>
compression spring or the like which, when instated within the housing between<br>
the female Luer connector 94 and the base of the valve plug 32, may cooperate width<br>
the elastomeric device 90 to bias the valve plug distally so as to maintain a bias<br>
tending to maintain a seal between the valve plug head 75 and the flow passage<br>
distal shoulder 49.<br>
The female Luer connector 26 of a patient's IV interface 24 (FIG. 1) shown<br>
adjacent the distal end of the male Luer connector 20 is generally configured with a.<br>
tubular barrel 28 having a distally-tapered interior surface 30 formed according to<br>
ANS1/AAMI/ISO standard 594.1 for medical connectors. The inner surface tapers<br>
inward in the distal direction from a larger diameter to a smaller diameter, A self-<br>
sealing piston 34 may be installed within the bairel having a selectively openable<br>
opening 35 responsive to compression of the piston upon insertion of a male Luer<br>
connector to open the opening and allow fluid flow through the female Luer<br>
connector. As will be discussed more fully below regarding FIGS. 4 and 5, the<br>
male body 42 of the self-sealing male Liter connector 20 is formed with a distally-<br>
tapensd exterior surface 44 that tapers in the distal direction from a larger diameter<br>
to a smaller diameter, configured to sealiagiy engage the tapered inside surface of<br>
the female Luer connector when the two connectors are mated.<br>
Turning, then, to FIG. 4, there is shown, a. partial cross-sectlonal view of the<br>
self-sealing male Luer connector 20 with the female Luer connector 26 partially<br>
inserted thereon. The valve element 75 of the connector 19 remains in the flow stop<br>
position. Specifically, the female Luer connector's tubular barrel 28 has been<br>
advanced proximally within the cavity 61 onto the male body 42 until the<br>
proximally-facing barrel abutment surface 29 has just come into contact with the<br>
15<br><br>
WO 2004/060474	PCT/US2003/040966<br>
distal ends 79 of the respective activation arms 78. In this position, the female Luer<br>
connector has not yet shifted the valve plug 70 proximally, so the distal head 75<br>
remains in sealing engagement within the flow passage 46 due to the biasing force<br>
of the elastomeric device 90 mounted within the activation openings 58 about the<br>
valve plug's activation arms. However, the tubular male body has passed a<br>
sufficient distance within the female Luer coonector's barrel to begin to form a<br>
taper-to-taper surface seal between the male body's outside surface 44 and the<br>
barrel's inside surface 30, Moreover, in this position, the passage of the distal end<br>
of the male body into the barrel has served to compress the self-sealing piston 34<br>
and thereby open the opening 35. Therefore, it will be appreciated by those skilled<br>
in the art that the male Luer connector is so configured that upon partial connection<br>
with a self-sealing female Luer connector, the two connectors begin to seal along<br>
their corresponding distally-tapered surfaces and the self-sealing piston is activated<br>
before any fluid flow through the male Luer connector is allowed. Hence, the male<br>
Luer connector in accordance with the present invention provides for safe and<br>
effective needleless connection to a self-sealing female Luer connector with<br>
minimized risk of fluid escape by essentially causing the female Luer connector to<br>
be activated before the male Luer connector is activated through further proximal<br>
movement of the female Luer connector.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 5, there is shown a partial cross-sectional view of the<br>
female Luer connector 26 fully inserted onto the self-sealing male Luer connector<br>
20, As such, through the engagement of theproximally-facing barrel abutment<br>
surface 29 with the distally-facing ends 79 of the activation arms 78, the valve plug<br>
70 has shifted proximally with the further proximal movement of the female Luer<br>
connector against the biasing force of the elastomeric sealing device 90 to unseat<br>
the distal head 75 from the shoulder 49 and allow flow through the flow passage 46,<br>
thereby now activating the male Luer connector. The valve element is thus in the<br>
flow position. As shown, the elastomeric material 91 comprising the sealing device<br>
remains bonded to both the activation arms and the activation openings 58 as it<br>
stretches proximally with the proximal movement of the entire valve plug. It will<br>
be appreciated by thase skilled in the art that while the bond strength, of an<br>
16<br><br>
WO 2004/060474	PCT/US2003/040966<br>
ultraviolet cured acrylic or the like as the elastomeric material may alone be<br>
sufficient to resist the forces applied by the proximal movement of the female Luer<br>
connector, the radially-inward flanges 59 formed about each activation opening<br>
provide a seat on which the elastomeric device can anchor, thereby improving the<br>
device's strength and its ability to remain installed within the activation openings<br>
about the activation amis even under load<br>
With continued reference to FIG- 5, with both the female Luer connector<br>
26's self-sealing piston 34 and the male Luer connector 20's valve plug 70<br>
activated, a fluid flow path is now formed through both connectors. Thus, as shown<br>
by flow arrows 88, in an exemplary embodiment in which the male Luer connector<br>
is mounted on a syringe 22 (FIG. 1) and then connected to a patient's IV interface<br>
24 (FIG. 1) so as to withdraw fluids, the fluid will flow through the female Luer<br>
connector's piston 34, its opening 35, the central flow passage opening 48 at the<br>
distal end of the flow passage 46, through the flow passage itself by passing around<br>
the distal head 75 and stem 72 of the valve plug, out the proximal end of the flow<br>
passage opening and through the flow openings 86 created by the space between the<br>
base 82 of the valve plug and the proximal housing wall 56, and through the<br>
proximal female Luer connector 94 into the syringe 22 (FIG. 1). The same flow<br>
path would be followed in reverse if medicines or other fluids are being dispensed<br>
from the syringe into the patient's IV line 25 (FIG. 1). In either case, once the<br>
desired quantity of fluids has been withdrawn into or dispensed from the syringe,<br>
the female Luer connector may then simply be disconnected from the male Luer<br>
connector, whereby the respective self-sealing devices would then reseal in the<br>
reverse order. That is, as the female Luer connector is withdrawn distally from the<br>
male Luer connector, the valve plug will reseal first under the biasing force exerted<br>
by the elastomeric device 90 when the female Luer connector reaches the position<br>
shown in FIG. 4. Further distal movement of the female Luer connector will<br>
completely disengage the proximally-facing barrel abutment surface 29 from the<br>
distal ends 79 of the activation arms 78 and will allow the self-sealing piston 34 to<br>
continue to expand until it reaches its at-rest position shown in FIG. 3 with the<br>
opening 35 again effectively closed. It will be appreciated that by having the valve<br>
17<br><br>
WO 2004/060474	PCT/US2003/040966<br>
plug reseal the male Luer connector before the taper-to-taper engagement between<br>
the outside and inside surfaces of the respective connectors is lost, any residual<br>
fluid in the syringe is effectively trapped on the syringe side by the valve plug,<br>
thereby preventing unwanted fluid escape and unnecessary risks of exposure and<br>
cross-contamination to the care giver and the patient. It will be further appreciated<br>
that the male Luer connector is easy to wipe and keep sanitary, as all engagement<br>
surfaces are exposed and easily accessible upon disconnection of the device from<br>
the female connector. The activation aims 78, and their linkage 82 and 83 thus<br>
fonn a valve element control device, with the arms disposed external to the male<br>
connector body adjacent the proximal end of the male connector body and being<br>
movable towards the proximal end, to control movement of the valve element to the<br>
flow position and being movable toward the distal end to control movement of the<br>
valve element to the flow stop position.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 3-5, it can be seen that the female Luer connector 26 may<br>
be formed on the proximal end of its tubular barrel 28 with external thread elements<br>
or portions 32 as is known in the art Accordingly, the inside surface 53 of the male<br>
Luer connector bousing 40's cuff 52 rosy be formed with internal threads 54<br>
configured to threadably engage the female Luer connector's external thread<br>
portions and thereby pull and secure the female connector in sealing engagement<br>
widi the male connectot. While it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that,<br>
the interference surface-to-surface fit between the respective distaily-tapered<br>
surfaces of the male and female connectors may be sufficient to maintain<br>
connection between mem during use, this means alone of securing the connection is<br>
not widely practiced, and the precautionary measure of the threadable engagement<br>
between me connectors as described and shown is preferred, It is to be understood,<br>
however, that numerous other connection means now known and later developed in<br>
the art for releasbly securing mate and female Luer connection in scaling<br>
engagement may be employed without departing from the scope of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Turning now to FIG. 6, there is seen a top view of the male Luer connector<br>
20 of FIG, 2, As shown from the perspective, then, of essentially looking down<br>
18<br><br>
WO 2004/060474	PCT/US2003/040966<br>
into the diatally-facing cavity 61 (FIG. 3) formed between the housing 40's outer<br>
cuff 52 and its inner distally-tapered tubular male body 42, there can be seen the<br>
orientation of the respective opposite activation aims 78 spaced about the male<br>
body and extending into the cavity from the housing's proximal wall 56, Again, the<br>
use of two activation arms essentially 180 degrees apart is only one of various<br>
arrangements possible in accordance with aspects of the present invention.<br>
In FIG. 7 there is shown a bottom view of the male Luer connector of FIG,<br>
2, with the proximally-projecting female Luer connector 94 (FIG- 2) removed for<br>
clarity in illustrating the relevant elements. As best seen in this view, the linkage<br>
82 of the valve plug 70 (FIG. 3) is configured as a substantially linear bar 83<br>
extending symmetrically in opposite directions away from the proximal end of the<br>
stem 72 so as to position the respective bar ends 84 substantially beneath the<br>
activation openings 58 (FIG. 3) so that the activation arms 78 (FIG. 3) extending<br>
distally away from the bar ends can freely translate within the activation openings.<br>
As also seen in this bottom view, the flow passage 46 is unhindered proximally by<br>
the base, allowing flow around the base with the valve plug in any position within<br>
the male body 42 (FIGS. 2-6), while the far, distal end of the flow passage is sealed<br>
off by the distal head 15 with the valve plug in the distally-biased position shown.<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that during; assembly of the valve<br>
plug within the housing, the plug will be inserted from the bottom as in FIG. 7 and<br>
then the activation arms will be bonded in place within the activation operaings by<br>
inserting the elastomeric device 90 in and about the openings so as to essentially pot<br>
the valve plug in position within the valve with the distal head sealingly seated in<br>
the distal end of the flow passage. Again, though an elastomeric material has been<br>
shown and described as the means for sealingly securing the valve plug in place, it<br>
is to be understood that this variation is merely one embodiment. It will be<br>
appreciated by those skilled in the art that other devices for sealing moving parts<br>
that move relative to one another, such as gaskets, o-rings and the like, that are now<br>
known or later developed may be employed without departing from the scope of the<br>
present invention.<br>
19<br><br>
WO 2004/060474	PCT/US2003/040966<br>
Referring now to FIGS, 8a-8e, there are shown enlarged partial cross-<br>
sectional views of various exemplary embodiments of the configuration of the distal<br>
end of the male body 42's flow passage 46 and the corresponding configuration of<br>
the valve plug 70's stem 72 and distal bead 75 so as to selectively seal within the<br>
flow passage as discussed above. It is to be understood that these embodiments are<br>
exemplary only and that a variety of sealing arrangements are possible. First, with<br>
reference to FIG. 8 a, there is seen the exemplary configuration of the male Luer<br>
connector 20 shown in FIGS. 2-7 wherein the flow passage has a distally-tapered<br>
interior surface 47 that terminates distally in a in a radially-inward, proximally-<br>
facing nesting shoulder 49. More specifically, as shown, the shoulder may be<br>
configured as a proximally-facing first frusto-conical surface 50. Accordingly, to<br>
provide far a surface-to-surface seal between the distal head and the shoulder, the<br>
distal head is configured with a distally-facing second frusto-conical surface 76 so<br>
as to correspond to the first frusto-conical surface. As also shown, the valve plug is<br>
formed as a unitary structure from a single material. As such, the stem and head<br>
may both be injection molded from a semirigid thermoplastic such that the stem has<br>
the necessary mechanical integrity to transmit the force exerted by the elastomeric<br>
device 90 (FIGS. 2 and 3) to the sealing surfaces of the distal head and flow<br>
passage so that they may engage to form a seal much like the tapered surfaces of 1he<br>
conventional rnale and female Luer connectors. Proximal of the second frusto-<br>
conical surface, the head transitions to a substantially straight-walled annular<br>
surface 77. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that as the valve plug is<br>
shifted proximally during use, as best seen in FIG. 5, these straight-wall surfaces<br>
provide for greater clearance between the head and the interior surface 47 of the<br>
flow passage, thereby improving the fluid flow around the head when the self-<br>
sealing male Luer connector is activated.<br>
Turning to FIG. 8b, there is shown a male body 42 and valve plug 70a quite<br>
similar to that of FIG. 8a, with the exception that the stem 72a and head 75a are not<br>
formed of one material in a unitary construction. Rather, the stem is formed again<br>
of a rigid or Semi-rigid material but is configured at its distal end with a distal<br>
flange 73. The head is then ovennolded onto the distal end of the stein about the<br>
20<br><br>
WO 2004/060474	PCT/US2003/040966<br>
distal flange. In this way, it will be appreciated that the head may be made of a<br>
resilient, flexible material so as to seal within the distal end of the flow passage 46.<br>
For this purpose, the material of the head may be selected from a number of<br>
medical grade silicon rubbers, thermoplastic elastomers, and thermoplastic<br>
vulcanites. With the use of such a conforming material for the valve plug's distal<br>
head, it will be further appreciated that the bead may be slightly oversized relative<br>
to the distal end of the flow passage so as to slightly compress the head when the<br>
valve plug is biased distally by the elastomeric sealing device 90 (FIGS. 2 and 3)<br>
and thereby Insure a positive seal when the male Luer connector is disconnected or<br>
is otherwise not in use. Further, other than over-molding, it will be appreciated that<br>
a resilient head could be molded in a separate operation and mounted onto the valve<br>
stem using other assembly techniques now know or later developed in the art, such<br>
as solvent bonding or snap- or press-fit.<br>
Turning now to FIGS. 8c and 8d, an alternative configuration for the<br>
radially-inwardly extending nesting shoulder 49a of the tubular male body 42a is<br>
shown wherein the shoulder is generally an annular flange that is perpendicular to<br>
the body's axis so as to form a squared proximally-facing sealing surface 50a. As<br>
previously; the annular flange defines a. central flow passage opening 48a through<br>
which fluids can selectively pass from a female Luer connector 26 (FIG. 5) into the<br>
male Luer connector's flow passage 46a. In FIG- 8c, the valve plug 70b is shown<br>
as having a generally "T"-shaped cross-section formed by a vertical stem 72b and a<br>
horizontal distal head 75b. With the valve plug in its distaliy-biased position as<br>
showm, the distally-facing head sealing surface 76b is brought into surface-to-<br>
surface contact with the shoulder's proximalliy-facing sealing surface so as to create<br>
a face seal and prevent fluid flow through the connector. Then when the valve as<br>
activated upon connection to a female Luer connector as described above and the<br>
distal head is shifted proximallyj it will be appreciated that the straight-walled side<br>
surface 77b again allows fluid flow between the head and the distally-tapered<br>
interior surface 47a of the flow passage.<br>
Similarly, as shown in the alternative exemplary embodiment of FIG. 8d, the<br>
distal head 75c may be configured with a substantially planar, distally-facing<br>
21<br><br>
WO 2004/060474	PCT/US2003/040966<br>
sealing surface 76c configured to create a face seal against the nesting shoulder<br>
49a's proximally-facing sealing surface 50a when the valve plug 70c is biased<br>
distally within the flow passage 46a. In addition, a distally-projecting head piug 98<br>
may be configured on the head's distally-facing surface so as to effectively plug<br>
and seal within the central flow passage opening 48a. In this way, more surface-to-<br>
surface engagement is provided to further effectuate a positive seal between the<br>
valve plug head and the distal end of the flow passage. The distal end of the head<br>
plug may be rounded to facilitate centering and seating the head plug within the<br>
flow passage opening. As also shown in FIG. 8d, the side surface 77c of the bead<br>
may be proximally-tapered or radiused inwardly to provide further clearance<br>
between the head and the interior surface 47a of the flow passage when the valve is<br>
activated.<br>
In FIG, 8e there is shown an alternative configuration of the tubular male<br>
body 42b in which the flow passage 46b is formed having a substantially straight-<br>
walled interior surface 47b parallel with the flow passage's central axis. The flow<br>
passage again terminates distally in a radially-inwardly-projecting, distally-tapered<br>
nesting shoulder 49b defining a central flow passage opening 48b and a proximally-<br>
facing first frusto-conical surface 50b. Due to the non-tapered interior surface of<br>
the flow passage, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the previous<br>
exemplary valve plug and head configurations will not effectively open the flow<br>
passage when the valve plug is shifted proximally upon connection to a female Luer<br>
connector 26 (FIG- 5), As such, the distal head 75d of the exemplary embodiment<br>
of FIG. 8e is configured with a central solid portion having lengthwise ribs 99<br>
spaced thereabout to allow for fluid communication around the head once the distal<br>
end of the head has unseated from the distal end of the flow passage. Specifically,<br>
the central portion of the head is formed distaily with a distally-facing second<br>
frusto-conical surface configured to sealingly engage the shoulder's first frusto-<br>
conical surface when the valve plug is biased distaily within the flow passage, much<br>
like the sealing engagement of the exemplary embodiments of FIGS. 8a and 8b.<br>
Then, when the valve plug is shifted proximally during connection with a female<br>
22<br><br>
WO 2004/060474	PCT/US2003/040966<br>
Luer connector, the first and second frusto-conical surfaces are disengaged to allow<br>
flow through the central flow passage opening into the flow passage.<br>
As best seen in FIG, 9, fluid flow can continue through the flow passage 46b<br>
around the valve plug's distal head 75d bypassing about the head's solid portion<br>
between the circumferentially spaced-apart ribs 99 and then around the narrower<br>
stem 72d and on through the connector as described previously. Thus, the ribs<br>
serve as spacers to space the solid central portion of the distal head away from the<br>
interior surface 47b of the flow passage, thereby allowing fluid flow around the<br>
bead. The ribs further serve to keep the stem and head centered within the flow<br>
passage as the valve plug 70d translates axially therein during use of the male Luer<br>
connector. It is noted that the taper-to-taper engagement between the distal head<br>
and the shoulder 49b (FIG, 8e) can alone serve to center the head as it seats in the<br>
distal end of the flow passage so as to effectively close the flow passage opening<br>
and that this function in combination with the stiffness of the stem may allow for<br>
the activation of the valve within a straight-walled flow passage without the use of<br>
the ribbed spacers, Hence, it will be appreciated that various other valve plug<br>
configurations with or without the ribbed spacers may be employed without<br>
departing from the scope of the invention.<br>
Furthermore, it will again be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the<br>
exemplary distal head and flow passage configurations shown and described in<br>
FIGS. 8a-8e are merely illustrative of selectively scalable arrangements for the<br>
respective engaging components final are possible and are in no way limiting of the<br>
scope of the present invention. By way of example, just as with the embodiment of<br>
FIG. 8a as illustrated in FIG. 8b, it will be appreciated that the exemplary<br>
embodiment male Luer connectors of FIGS. 8c-8e may also be configured with the<br>
valve plug having a, single, unitary construction or with the stem of a rigid or semi-<br>
rigid plastic and a resilient head overmolded or otherwise mounted onto the stein's<br>
distal end<br>
Referring now to FIG. 10, there is shown an alternative embodiment of a<br>
connector 19a having a male Luer connector 20a having a blood collection device<br>
95 mounted opposite the houstog 40. The blood collection device, which is known<br>
23<br><br>
WO 2004/060474	PCT/US2003/040966<br>
and used in the an, includes a proximally-extending needle cannula97 and a shield<br>
96 mounted about the needle so as to protect care givers and patients from<br>
accidental needle punctures. So configured, the connectors male body 42 may be<br>
connected to the female Luer connector 26 of a patient's IV interface 24 (FIG. 1),<br>
as discussed above, to activate the internal valve plug 70 (FIG. 2) and create a<br>
needle free flow path between the patient's IV line 25 (RG. I) and the needle<br>
through the male Luer connector. As is known in the art, a resilient boot (not<br>
shown) over the needle prevents the flow of fluid through the needle until a<br>
vacuumized blood collection vial with septum (not shown) is inserted within the<br>
blood collection device shield to push the boot up the needle while the needle then<br>
penetrates the septum to allow fluid to flow therethrough into the vial. When the<br>
vial is full, it may be removed from the blood collection device and another<br>
installed therein, until the desired quantity of blood has been withdrawn. Then, the<br>
male connector may simply be disconnected from the female connector on the<br>
patient's IV line and discarded. From the foregoing, it will be appreciated that upon<br>
disconnection, the valve plug is shifted proximally by the elastomeric device 90<br>
(FIG. 2) installed within the housing, thereby causing the distal bead 75 (FIG. 3) to<br>
reseal within the flow passage 46 (FIG- 3) to trap all blood and other fluids within<br>
the male Luer connector fox safe disposal Thus, in this embodiment, as with the<br>
exemplary embodiment including a conventional female connector, the self-sealing<br>
internal valve plug operably installed within the male connector serves to safely and<br>
easily connect to and disconnect from the female Luer connector of a patient's TV<br>
line for the effective and controlled administration and/or withdrawal of fluids,<br>
Therefore, the male Luer connector is well-suited for connection to a syringe<br>
or other device used to transfer fluids to and from a patient without compromising<br>
the patient's or the care giver's safety. While particular forms of the invention have<br>
been ilunstrated and described, it will also be apparent to those skilled in the art that<br>
various modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of<br>
the invention. Accordingly, it is not intended that the invention be limited except<br>
by the appended claims.<br>
