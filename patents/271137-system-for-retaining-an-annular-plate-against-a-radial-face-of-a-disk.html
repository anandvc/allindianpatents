				<td>SYSTEM FOR RETAINING AN ANNULAR PLATE AGAINST A RADIAL<br>
FACE OF A DISK<br>
The invention relates to a system for retaining an<br>
annular plate against a radial face of a disk.<br>
More particularly, the present invention relates to<br>
a system for retaining an annular plate against a radial<br>
face of a disk, the disk presenting in said radial face<br>
an annular recess defined by a plurality of walls, one of<br>
which is formed by a face of a flange which extends<br>
radially outwards, said plate presenting in its radially<br>
inner portion an annular base pressing against the<br>
radially outer wall of the recess and a root extending<br>
radially towards the inside of the recess from the<br>
axially inner end of the base, said system including a<br>
split annular retaining ring disposed in the recess.<br>
At present, amongst the various solutions that are<br>
available, there is the solution set out in FR 2 812 906:<br>
that solution uses a retaining ring provided with a<br>
rabbet on its radially outer face in order to receive a<br>
portion of the root. During disassembly, in order to<br>
allow the root to be removed from the recess, radial<br>
compression is applied to the ring by means of a tool<br>
which is inserted in a notch at the radially inner end of<br>
the root and which bears against the radially outer face<br>
of the ring so as to lower it until the tool comes to<br>
bear against the top end of the annular flange adjacent<br>
to the annular recess of the disk.<br>
Nevertheless, that solution can lead to the radially<br>
inner end of the root of the annular plate being damaged.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
system for retaining an annular plate against a radial<br>
face of a disk, enabling assembly and also disassembly to<br>
be simple without any risk of damaging the plate, and<br>
also without requiring recourse to special tooling.<br>
To this end, in the present invention, in<br>
characteristic manner, said flange presents a top end of<br>
crenellated outline provided with at least one notch,<br>
said root is provided in its radially inner portion with<br>
a front rim which presents a crenellated outline of shape<br>
complementary to the top end of the flange, and a rear<br>
rim, said front and rear rims extending radially inwards<br>
and defining between them an annular groove, said front<br>
rim being provided with at least one mortice, said<br>
retaining ring presents on its axially outer face at<br>
least one tenon extending in an axial direction and<br>
suitable for penetrating in said notch and in said<br>
mortice, the rear rim of the root of the plate and said<br>
tenon of the retaining ring carry facing annular chamfers<br>
for enabling the ring previously disposed in the recess<br>
to be compressed radially during axial sliding of the<br>
base into the recess during an initial step of mounting<br>
the plate on the disk, at the end of which step the ring<br>
is retained axially in said groove, and the tenons<br>
present respective free ends of transverse width greater<br>
than the transverse width of the notches so as to retain<br>
the plate axially against the flange when the root of the<br>
plate is turned in the recess during a second step of<br>
mounting the plate on the disk.<br>
It will thus be understood that it is possible to<br>
lock the plate reliably relative to the disk in the axial<br>
direction and in rotation.<br>
Also, such an arrangement is easy to implement<br>
because of the way the retaining ring is used which is<br>
the only part to be subjected to compression (radial<br>
compression) during disassembly, the plate being<br>
subjected to rotation only, where rotation does not run<br>
the risk of damaging the radially inner end of the root<br>
of the plate.<br>
Overall, because of the arrangement of the present<br>
invention, and in particular because of the presence of<br>
the tenon of the retaining ring which is received in the<br>
notch of the annular crenellated flange of the disk, it<br>
is possible to disassemble and to reassemble the system<br>
without special tooling.<br>
Preferably, the section of the ring in the axial<br>
direction is of width substantially equal to the width of<br>
the groove in the axial direction.<br>
This means that the axial distance between the rear<br>
face and the front face of the groove is designed to<br>
enable the width in the axial direction of the section of<br>
the ring to be inserted therein with practically no<br>
clearance.<br>
Preferably, the length of the tenon in the axial<br>
direction is greater than the sum of the thickness in the<br>
axial direction of the front rim of the root of the plate<br>
plus the thickness in the axial direction of the annular<br>
flange of the disk.<br>
This gives easy access to the free end of the tenon<br>
which projects beyond the flange in the axial direction,<br>
thereby facilitating disassembly merely by pressing<br>
against said free end of the tenon.<br>
In a preferred disposition, said tenon presents a<br>
width that is substantially equal to the width of the<br>
mortise of the front rim.<br>
Such an arrangement makes it possible to avoid any<br>
clearance between the sides of the tenon and the side<br>
walls of the mortice, thus avoiding any shocks between<br>
those parts while the disk is in rotation, and thus<br>
avoiding premature wear of the retaining ring and the<br>
plate.<br>
In another preferred disposition, said tenon<br>
presents a width substantially equal to the width of the<br>
notch of the flange.<br>
This disposition makes it possible to avoid<br>
clearance between the sides of the tenon and the side<br>
walls of the notch, thus avoiding any shocks between<br>
these parts while the disk is rotating, and thus avoiding<br>
any premature wear of the retaining ring and the disk.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, said front rim extends<br>
radially over a height that is greater than or equal to<br>
the radial thickness of the ring.<br>
In this way, axial thrust (support or bearing) is<br>
achieved between the entire surface of the axially outer<br>
face of the retaining ring and the front face of the<br>
groove, this thrust over a maximum area enabling the<br>
stress exerted in the axial direction on the retaining<br>
ring to be minimized.<br>
Other advantages and characteristics of the<br>
invention appear on reading the following description<br>
made by way of example and with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
• Figure 1A is a fragmentary projection view of a<br>
rotor disk which, prior to assembly, includes a system of<br>
the present invention;<br>
• Figure IB is a section view of Figure 1A on line<br>
IB-IB;<br>
• Figure 1C is a section view on a larger scale<br>
showing a portion of Figure IB in greater detail;<br>
• Figure ID is a plan view in a radial direction of<br>
the retaining ring;<br>
• Figures 2A and 2B are views similar to Figures 1A<br>
and IB during a first step of mounting the annular plate<br>
on the disk;<br>
• Figures 3A and 3B are views similar to those of<br>
Figures 1A and IB during a second step of mounting the<br>
annular plate on the disk; and<br>
• Figures 4A, 4B, and 4C are views similar to those<br>
of Figures 1A, IB, and 1C once mounting has been<br>
completed.<br>
In the figures, and in particular in Figure 1C,<br>
there can be seen a rotor disk 10 of a gas turbine engine<br>
having an axis of rotation 12.<br>
On its radial face 14, this disk 10 presents a<br>
recess 16 defined by a radially outer wall 18, an axially<br>
inner wall 20, a radially inner wall 22, and the inside<br>
face 24 of an annular flange 26 which extends radially<br>
outwards from the radially inner wall 22.<br>
The top end 28 of the annular flange 26 is radially<br>
distant from the radially outer wall 18 so as to leave a<br>
circular opening 30 giving access to the recess 16.<br>
Notches 29 of U-shaped outline that are open to the<br>
top end 28 of the annular flange 26 are formed through<br>
the entire thickness of the annular flange 26 and are<br>
disposed at regular intervals all around the flange 26.<br>
These notches 29 extend radially from the top end 28 of<br>
the annular flange 26 to a distance enabling an annular<br>
plate 36 to be inserted in a manner explained below.<br>
At its periphery, the disk 10 includes indentations<br>
such as axial notches for receiving blade roots 32 as can<br>
be seen in Figures IB, 2B, 3B, and 4B. These blade roots<br>
are prevented from moving axially by the radially outer<br>
portion 34 of the annular plate 36 whose radially inner<br>
portion 38 has an annular base 40 which extends axially<br>
into the outer region of the recess 16 and a root 42<br>
which extends radially towards the axis of rotation 12<br>
and axially towards the outside of the recess 16 from the<br>
inside end of the annular base 40.<br>
The outside diameter of the annular base 40 is<br>
substantially equal to the diameter of the radially outer<br>
wall 18 of the recess 16 and the annular base 40 bears in<br>
sliding manner against said outer wall 18.<br>
The top end 28 of the annular flange 26 presents a<br>
crenellated or festooned outline formed, in the radial<br>
direction, by a regular alternation of indentations and<br>
projections forming a series of undulations, as can be<br>
seen in Figures 1A, 2A, 3A, and 4A.<br>
It should be observed that the notches 29 are<br>
situated in the projecting zones of the crenellated<br>
outline of the annular flange 26.<br>
In order to enable the annular base 40 of the root<br>
42 to be inserted through the annular opening 30 into the<br>
recess 16, the distance between the outside diameter of<br>
the annular base 40 of an indentation (or a projection)<br>
of the end face 68 of the front rim 62 is firstly greater<br>
than the distance between the radially outer wall 18 of a<br>
projection (or an indentation) of the top end 28 of the<br>
flange 26, and secondly smaller than the distance between<br>
the radially outer walls 18 of the bottoms of the notches<br>
29 in the flange 26.<br>
When the radially inner portion 38 of the annular<br>
plate 36 is inserted into the recess 16, the plate 36 is<br>
prevented from moving radially relative to the disk 10<br>
because its annular base 40 bears in sliding manner<br>
against the radially outer wall 18.<br>
The plate 36 is held axially on the disk 10 by a<br>
split annular retaining ring 44.<br>
As can be seen in Figure 1C, the split annular<br>
retaining ring 44 presents an axially outer face 46, an<br>
axially inner face 48, a radially outer face 50 connected<br>
to the axially outer face 46 and to the axially inner<br>
face 48, and a radially inner face 52.<br>
The diameter of the radially inner face 52 is<br>
greater than the diameter of the radially inner wall 22<br>
of the recess 16, and less than the diameter of a<br>
projection at the top end 28 of the flange 26, by a<br>
distance that enables the retaining ring 44 to be<br>
retracted behind the annular flange 26 by being<br>
compressed while the plate 36 is being put into place.<br>
The split annular retaining ring 44 also presents<br>
tenons 54 extending axially outwards from the axially<br>
outer face 46 in line with the radially outer face 50 and<br>
the radially inner face 52, each having a free end 56<br>
that is enlarged transversely relative to the axis of<br>
rotation 12.<br>
The width in the transverse direction of these<br>
tenons 54 enables them to be inserted into respective<br>
corresponding notches 29, with the enlarged end 56 of<br>
each tenon being retained axially by the annular flange<br>
26 because said enlarged end 56 is of a length in the<br>
transverse direction that is greater than the width of<br>
the notches 29.<br>
The notches 29 are regularly distributed at an<br>
angular spacing equal to the angular spacing between two<br>
consecutive tenons 54 of the retaining ring 44.<br>
The front face 58 of the enlarged end 56 of a tenon<br>
54 is connected to the radially outer face 50 by a<br>
chamfer 60.<br>
As can be seen more clearly in Figure 1C, the root<br>
42 of the annular plate 36 presents a radially inner end<br>
provided with a front annular rim 62 and a rear annular<br>
rim 64 with an annular groove 66 being defined between<br>
them and having an axis of symmetry of revolution that is<br>
parallel to the axis of rotation 12.<br>
In cross-section, the annular groove 66 presents a<br>
U-shape with its open side facing towards the axis of<br>
rotation 12.<br>
The front annular rim 62 is defined by an end face<br>
68, a front face 70 of the annular groove 66, and a front<br>
face 72. The end face 68 facing towards the axis of<br>
rotation 12 connects the front face 70 of the annular<br>
groove 66 to the front face 72 of the front annular rim<br>
62.<br>
The rear annular rim 64 is defined by an end face<br>
74, a rear face 76 of the annular groove 66, and a<br>
chamfer 78. The end face 74 facing towards the axis of<br>
rotation 12 connects the rear face 76 of the annular<br>
groove 66 to the chamfer 78 of the rear annular rim 64.<br>
The chamfers 60 of the tenons 54 and the chamfer 78<br>
of the rear annular rim 64 of the root 42 of the annular<br>
plate 36 are at identical angles relative to the axis of<br>
rotation 12 of the disk 10, lying in the range 10° to<br>
45°.<br>
The annular groove 66 is thus defined by the front<br>
face 70, the rear face 76, and by an annular bottom wall<br>
80 facing towards the axis of rotation 12.<br>
In addition, it should be observed that the axially<br>
outer face 46 of the retaining ring 44 is designed to<br>
bear against the front face 70 of the annular groove 66.<br>
Also, the axially inner face 48 of the split<br>
retaining ring 44 is designed to bear against the rear<br>
face 76 of the annular groove 66.<br>
In addition, the radially outer face 50 of the split<br>
retaining ring 44 is designed to bear against the annular<br>
bottom 80 of the annular groove 66.<br>
In its radially inner portion of the front annular<br>
rim 62, the root 42 of the plate 36 presents a<br>
crenellated outline that is complementary in shape to the<br>
top end 28 of the flange 26.<br>
As can be seen in Figures 1A, 2A, 3A, and 4A, the<br>
end face 68 of the front rim 62 is formed in the radial<br>
direction by a regular alternation of indentations and<br>
projections forming a series of undulations that can be<br>
seen from outside the disk 10 (from the right-hand side<br>
of Figures IB, 2B, 3B, 4B, 1C, and 4C).<br>
Mortises (slots) 82 are formed in the front annular<br>
rim 62 that are regularly spaced apart at an angular<br>
interval equal to the interval between two consecutive<br>
tenons 54 of the retaining ring 44.<br>
These mortises 82 are directed parallel to the axis<br>
of rotation 12 and they are U-shaped in cross-section<br>
with the open side of the U-shape turned towards the axis<br>
of rotation 12.<br>
These mortises 82 are also situated at the locations<br>
of the projections of the crenellated outline of the end<br>
face 68 of the front rim 62.<br>
For reasons of ease of fabrication during machining,<br>
these mortises 82 made in the front annular rim 62 are in<br>
alignment with corresponding mortises (slots) 82' in the<br>
rear annular rim 64.<br>
It can be seen that the width in the axial direction<br>
parallel to the axis of rotation 12 of the cross-section<br>
of the annular ring 44 is substantially equal or slightly<br>
less than the width in the axial direction of the annular<br>
groove 66. This disposition makes it possible to house<br>
the annular ring 44 in the annular groove 66 with no<br>
clearance or practically no clearance.<br>
It should also be observed that the length in the<br>
axial direction of the tenon 54, i.e. the distance<br>
between the axially outer face 46 of the retaining ring<br>
44 and the front face 58 of the enlarged end 56, is<br>
greater than the sum of the thickness in the axial<br>
direction of the front rim 62 of the root of the plate<br>
plus the thickness in the axial direction of the annular<br>
flange 26 of the disk 10. In this way, in addition to<br>
the above-described disposition, it will be understood<br>
that the retaining ring 44 enables the annular plate 36<br>
to be retained axially on the flange 26 of the disk 10.<br>
According to an essential characteristic, in order<br>
to retain the annular plate axially against the disk 10<br>
in the recess 16, the free end 56 of each tenon 54 is<br>
enlarged so as to reach a width in a transverse direction<br>
(perpendicular to the longitudinal direction 12 and to<br>
the radial direction) that is greater than the width of<br>
each notch 29 in the transverse direction.<br>
In this manner, after assembly, the rear face of the<br>
free end 56 of each tenon 54 comes to bear against the<br>
outer face 25 of the annular flange 26.<br>
It should also be observed that each tenon 54 is of<br>
a width in a transverse direction perpendicular to the<br>
axis of rotation 12 that is substantially equal to or<br>
slightly less than the width in the transverse direction<br>
of a mortise 82 in the front rim 62. In addition, each<br>
tenon 54 is of a width in a transverse direction that is<br>
substantially equal to or slightly less than the width in<br>
the transverse direction of a notch 29 in the flange 26.<br>
In this way, each tenon 54 which is received both in<br>
a notch 29 of the annular flange 26 and in a mortise 82<br>
of the front annular rim 62 of the root 42 of the plate<br>
36 serves to prevent the plate 36 and the disk 10 from<br>
turning relative to each other, and does so with little<br>
or no clearance.<br>
Furthermore, the front rim 62 extends radially over<br>
a height which is greater than or equal to the radial<br>
thickness of the retaining ring 44: this guarantees<br>
maximum contact area and thus minimum axial stress<br>
between the axially outer face 46 of the retaining ring<br>
44 and the front rim of the plate 36, and more precisely<br>
the front face 70 of the groove 66.<br>
Various stages in mounting the plate 36 on the disk<br>
10 are described below with reference to Figures 1A to<br>
4C.<br>
The annular retaining ring 44 is enlarged and then<br>
received in the recess 16, with the tenons 54 being<br>
placed in respective corresponding notches 29 of the<br>
flange 26. The annular retaining ring 44 automatically<br>
takes up a rest position as shown in Figures 1A to 1C<br>
once the radial force holding it split open ceases to be<br>
exerted.<br>
In this position, the diameter of the radially outer<br>
face 50 of the split annular retaining ring 44 is greater<br>
than the diameter of the projections in the crenellated<br>
outline forming the top end 28 of the annular flange 26.<br>
Likewise, in the situation that can be seen in<br>
Figures 1A to 1C, the annular flange 26 thus retains the<br>
retaining ring 44 in the axial direction since when the<br>
retaining ring 44 moves axially to the right in Figure IB<br>
or Figure 1C, the inside face 24 of the flange 26 comes<br>
to bear against the axially outer face 46 of the<br>
retaining ring 44, and when the retaining ring 44 is<br>
moved axially to the left in Figure IB or Figure 1C, then<br>
it is the outside face 25 of the flange 26 that comes to<br>
bear against the rear faces of the enlarged ends 56 of<br>
the tenons 54 .<br>
Naturally, this situation is due to the fact that<br>
the width in the transverse direction of the free end 56<br>
of each tenon 54 is greater than the width in the<br>
transverse direction of the notches 29.<br>
The plate 36 is then positioned so that its root 42<br>
is situated facing the annular opening 30 of the recess<br>
16. The chamfer 78 of the rear rim 64 of the root 42<br>
then comes to bear against the chamfer 60 on each tenon<br>
52 of the retaining ring 44. In this position, as can be<br>
seen in Figures 1A to 1C, the retaining ring 44 is<br>
centered relative to the axis of rotation 12 of the disk<br>
10.<br>
In the following step, shown in Figures 2A and 2B,<br>
an axial force F is applied to the annular plate, e.g. to<br>
the top portion thereof, thus leading to the retaining<br>
ring 44 being compressed radially and to the annular base<br>
40 of the plate 36 moving axially towards the recess 16,<br>
and in particular towards the axially inner wall 20 and<br>
the radially outer wall 18 of the recess 16.<br>
It will be understood that the radial compression of<br>
the retaining ring 44 is due to the chamfers 60 and 78<br>
sliding over each other.<br>
During this approach, the annular base 40 of the<br>
plate 36 slides against the radially outer wall 18 of the<br>
recess until it comes close enough to the axially inner<br>
wall 20 to reach the position shown in Figures 3A and 3B,<br>
where the top portion of the plate 36 comes to bear<br>
against the radial face 14 of the disk 10 and the roots<br>
32 of the blades.<br>
In this position shown in Figures 3A and 3B, since<br>
the rear rim 64 and then the front rim 62 have moved<br>
successively past the flange 26 by penetrating into the<br>
recess 16, the situation is reached in which the<br>
retaining ring 44 is received in the annular groove 66<br>
and the front annular rim 62 becomes interposed between<br>
the retaining ring 44 and the annular flange 26.<br>
Thereafter, the retaining ring 44 relaxes, expanding<br>
radially until it comes to bear against the bottom wall<br>
80 of the annular groove 66 (Figures 4A, 4B, and 4C).<br>
The plate 36 is preferably mounted on the disk 10<br>
with axial prestress.<br>
As can be seen in Figures 3A and 3B, the plate 36 is<br>
also turned (arrow R) relative to the disk so that after<br>
mounting it reaches the situation that is shown in<br>
Figures 4A, 4B, and 4C. The mortises 82 in the front rim<br>
62 then overlie the tenons 54, thus enabling the<br>
retaining ring 44 to relax, expanding radially until it<br>
comes to bear against the bottom wall 80 of the annular<br>
groove 66.<br>
In this situation, the tenons 54 of the retaining<br>
ring 44 serve as keys between the plate 36 and the flange<br>
26 of the disk 10 which are then connected to each other<br>
with a system that is similar to a bayonet fastening, by<br>
a combination of axial engagement and turning.<br>
The plate 36 is prevented from moving relative to<br>
the disk 10 firstly in an axial direction by the front<br>
face 72 of the front rim 62 bearing against the inside<br>
face 24 of the crenellated annular flange 26, with this<br>
happening only after the second mounting step in which<br>
the plate 36 is turned relative to the disk 10 through an<br>
angle such as the angle forming the angular interval<br>
between the indentations (or projections) of the top ends<br>
28 of the annular flange 26 or the end face 68 of the<br>
front rim 62.<br>
Furthermore, the plate 36 is prevented from turning<br>
relative to the disk 10 because of the tenons 54 received<br>
in the notches 29 of the flange 26 and in the mortises 82<br>
of the front rim 62.<br>
In order to disassemble the plate 36 easily from the<br>
disk 10, it is necessary to perform the above-described<br>
operations in the reverse order. Thus, disassembly is<br>
performed by a first operation consisting in turning the<br>
plate 36 (in the direction opposite to that of the arrow<br>
R in Figures 3A and 3B) and by a second operation<br>
consisting in pressing on the chamfer 60 so as to<br>
compress the ring 44 axially and allow the plate 36 to be<br>
disengaged.<br>
In this way, it will be understood that it is<br>
possible to make do without special tooling when mounting<br>
and removing the plate, and in addition the disk is not<br>
stressed during mounting and removal steps so it is not<br>
subjected to stress outside its periods of operation,<br>
there by increasing its lifetime.<br><br><br>
