				<td>Description<br>
The present invention relates to a weathering apparatus.<br>
In a weathering apparatus, the weather-dependent ageing behaviour of a sample, in<br>
particular of a flat material sample, is assessed, with the sample being subjected to<br>
artificial weathering. The weathering apparatus for this purpose normally has a<br>
weathering chamber, in which holding means are arranged for holding samples to be<br>
weathered, and in which; orie or more radiation' sources are arranged in order to<br>
apply radiation, in particular UV radiation, to the samples.<br>
Apparatuses for artificial weathering of material samples are generally used to<br>
estimate the life of materials which are continuously subjected to natural weather<br>
conditions during their use, and which thus deteriorate under climatic influences<br>
such as sunlight, solar heat, humidity and the like. In order to obtain a good<br>
simulation of the natural weathering characteristics, it is advantageous for the<br>
spectral energy distribution of the light produced in the apparatus to correspond as<br>
far as possible to that of the natural solar radiation, for which reason appliances<br>
such as these use xenon emitters as their radiation source. In addition, an<br>
accelerated ageing test of the materials is achieved essentially by illuminating the<br>
samples more intensively than the natural conditions, thus speeding up the ageing<br>
of the samples. A statement about the long-term ageing behaviour of a material<br>
sample can thus be made after a relatively short time.<br>
The majority of the material samples which are investigated in artificial weathering<br>
appliances are composed of polymer materials. The weather-dependent<br>
deterioration of polymer materials is caused substantially by the UV component of<br>
the solar radiation. The primary photochemical processes which take place in this<br>
case, that is to say the absorption of photons and the production of stimulated states<br>
or free radicals, are not dependent on the temperature. In contrast, the subsequent<br>
reaction steps with the polymers or additives may be dependent on the temperature,<br>
so that the observed ageing of the materials is likewise dependent on the<br>
temperature.<br><br>
One or more UV radiation sources, such as xenon radiation sources, is or are<br>
optionally used in the previously known weathering apparatuses. As is known, these<br>
allow the entire solar spectrum to be simulated quite well, in which case the relatively<br>
high spectral component in the infrared spectral range can be attenuated by suitable<br>
IR filters.<br>
The radiation power emitted from the UV radiation sources is measured by UV<br>
sensors, in which case it is-possible to provide for each UV radiation source to have<br>
its own associated UV sensor. The output signal from the UV sensors is supplied to<br>
a control and recording device in which the UV radiation powers can be recorded<br>
during a weathering process. Furthermore, the output signals from the UV sensors<br>
can be supplied to a control device, by means of which the electrical power to be<br>
supplied to the power supply devices for the UV radiation sources can be regulated<br>
at constant UV radiation power levels.<br>
It is known for broadband UV sensors to be used in weathering apparatuses, which<br>
have a sensitivity range in the range from 300 nm to 400 nm, in accordance with the<br>
IS Standard. However, there is also frequently a requirement for weathering<br>
processes to be carried out with the UV radiation power being measured using the<br>
NB Standard. In this Standard, the radiation power is optionally measured in the two<br>
narrowband ranges of 340 nm ± 10 nm or 420 ±10 nm, with the latter range being<br>
outside the UV range, in the visible, blue spectral range. However, in the prior art,<br>
there are only sensors which are calibrated for in each case one of the already<br>
mentioned three sensitivity ranges. Accordingly, if there is a wish to use a different<br>
standard for the radiation power measurement from one weathering process to the<br>
next, in particular based on a different sensitivity range, then it is either necessary to<br>
replace the sensors or, if this is not possible, a different weathering apparatus must<br>
be used.<br>
A change in the Standard for the measurement of the radiation power is accordingly<br>
associated with considerable effort and additional costs in the prior art.<br><br>
One object of the present invention is accordingly to specify a weathering apparatus<br>
which allows weathering processes to be carried out using different power<br>
measurement standards, with relatively little effort.<br>
This object is achieved by the weathering apparatus according to the present<br>
invention. The present invention provides a weathering apparatus comprising an UV<br>
radiation source and a first sensor, which is calibrated for a first spectral sensitivity<br>
range in the UV and which producers an output signal such as described herein <br>
representative of the radiation power received in the first sensitivity range, wherein<br>
the first sensor is additionally calibrated in such a way that the radiation power of a<br>
second spectral sensitivity range which is located within the first spectral sensitivity<br>
range can be determined from said output signal in the manner such as described<br>
herein.<br>
A second sensor is preferably provided, which is calibrated for a third spectral<br>
sensitivity range. The first sensitivity range may extends from 300 nm to 400 nm, the<br>
second spectral sensitivity range may extend from 330 nm to 350 nm and the third<br>
spectral sensitivity range may extend from 410 nm to 430 nm. Preferably, at least<br>
two UV radiation sources are provided, one of which is in each case associated with<br>
one of the first sensors and detects essentially the UV radiation from the<br>
respectively associated UV radiation source. The second sensor is preferably<br>
associated with a UV radiation source that is used as a reference radiation source,<br>
and detects essentially the radiation from the reference radiation source. The<br>
radiation power from a UV radiation source in the third spectral sensitivity range can<br>
be derived from the output signal from its associated first sensor and the output<br>
signals from the first sensor and from the second sensor for the reference radiation<br>
source.<br>
The present invention also provides a weathering apparatus comprising one or more<br>
UV radiation sources; and one or more first sensors, which are calibrated for a first<br>
spectral sensitivity range in the UV and each produce an output signal which is<br>
representative of the radiation power received in the first sensitivity range, wherein<br><br>

accommodated, the UV radiation sources are arranged along a first wall of the<br>
weathering chamber, the samples to be weathered are arranged along a second<br>
wall, which is opposite the first wall, and the UV sensors are fitted to a third wall,<br>
which connects the first wall and the second wall, and in particular-are inserted into<br>
openings in the third wall.<br>
The samples to be weathered are held by the second wall or by a holding plate. At<br>
least two UV radiation sources are provided, one of which is in each case associated<br>
with one of the first sensors and detects essentially the UV radiation from the<br>
respectively associated UV radiation source. The second sensor is preferably<br>

and detects essentially the radiation from the reference radiation source.<br>

The present invention still further provides a weathering apparatus comprising one<br>
or more UV radiation sources, and one or more first sensors, which are calibrated for<br>
a first spectral sensitivity range in the UV and each produce an output signal which<br>
is representative of the radiation power received in the first sensitivity range, wherein<br>

which is calibrated for a second spectral sensitivity range, wherein the second<br>

the UV radiation sources and the UV sensors are accommodated, the UV radiation<br>
sources are arranged along a first wall of the weathering chamber, the samples to<br>
be weathered are arranged along a second wall, which is opposite the first wall, and<br>
the UV sensors are fitted to a third wall, and, which connects the first wall and the<br>
second wall, and in particular are inserted into openings in the third wall.<br>
A weathering apparatus in accordance with the present invention has one or more<br>
UV radiation sources and one or more first sensors, which are calibrated for a first<br><br>
spectral sensitivity range in the UV and each produce<br>
an output signal which is representative of the<br>
radiation power received in the first sensitivity<br>
range. The first sensitivity range may be a broadband<br>
range from 300 nm to 400 nm.<br>
One major idea according to a first aspect of the<br>
present invention relates to the first sensor or one of<br>
the first sensors additionally being calibrated in such<br>
a way that the radiation power of a spectral range<br>
which is located within the first sensitivity range can<br>
be determined from its output signal.<br>
This spectral range may in this case extend from 330 nm<br>
to 350 nm, and thus corresponds to the measurement<br>
range of 340 nm ± 10 nm, as specified in the NB<br>
Standard.<br>
One major idea according to a second aspect of the<br>
present invention relates to a second sensor being<br>
provided in addition to the first sensor or sensors,<br>
and being calibrated for a second spectral sensitivity<br>
range.<br>
This second spectral sensitivity range may extend from<br>
410 nm to 4 30 nm, and thus corresponds to the<br>
measurement range of 420 nm ± 10 nm, as likewise<br>
specified in the NB Standard. This range is outside the<br>
UV, in the visible blue spectral range. A measurement<br>
in this range thus makes use of the fact that certain<br>
UV radiation sources also emit in the adjacent visible<br>
spectral range, and the radiation power in this<br>
measurement range has a constant ratio to the radiation<br>
power in the UV range.<br>
The two aspects of the present invention can be<br>
combined with one another in a particularly<br>
advantageous manner, thus making it possible to record<br><br>
all three spectral ranges,	as mentioned further above,<br>
for measurement purposes	in one weathering process<br>
using a small number of	sensors in one weathering<br>
apparatus.<br>
This becomes more significant, the greater the number<br>
of UV radiation sources in the weathering apparatus.<br>
One advantageous refinement of the invention is for the<br>
weathering apparatus to have a number of UV radiation<br>
sources, one of which is in each case associated with<br>
one of the first sensors and detects essentially only<br>
the UV radiation from the respectively associated UV<br>
radiation source. By way of example, the weathering<br>
apparatus may have two, three or even more than three<br>
UV radiation sources and may have a corresponding<br>
number of first sensors, which are each arranged in<br>
such a way that they detect only the radiation from the<br>
respectively associated radiation source.<br>
In the case of three UV radiation sources in the<br>
weathering apparatus, it is sufficient - as will be<br>
seen later - to use four sensors in order to record the<br>
three sensitivity ranges (as mentioned further above)<br>
for measurement purposes, while a total of nine sensors<br>
would be necessary for this purpose in conventional<br>
appliances.<br>
However, according to the invention, it is also<br>
possible to provide for the weathering apparatus to<br>
have only a single UV radiation source. It is then<br>
possible to arrange one and only one first sensor in<br>
the weathering apparatus, and to additionally calibrate<br>
this first sensor for the spectral range within the<br>
first sensitivity range. Additionally or as an<br>
alternative to this, a second sensor can then be<br>
provided so that a total of two sensors would be<br>
provided in a case such as this.<br><br>
In the second aspect of the present invention, the second sensor is preferably<br>
associated with one specific UV radiation source (reference radiation source) of a<br>
number of UV radiation sources, and it detects essentially only the radiation emitted<br>
by this associated UV radiation source in the second sensitivity range. This second<br>
sensor can then also be used to derive the radiation powers from the other UV<br>
radiation sources in the second spectral sensitivity range from the output signal from<br>
its associated first sensor and the output signals: from the first and the second<br>
sensor for the reference radiation source.<br>
According to a further advantageous embodiment, the weathering apparatus<br>
according to the invention has a weathering chamber in which the UV radiation<br>
sources and the sensors are accommodated, wherein the UV radiation sources are<br>
arranged along a first wall of the weathering chamber, and the samples to be<br>
weathered are arranged along a second wall, which is opposite the first wall, and the<br>
sensors are fitted to a third wall, which connects the first wall and the second wall,<br>
and in particular are inserted into openings in the third wall.<br>
In this case, the sensors are preferably used in such a way that they are aligned at<br>
an inclined angle to the respective UV radiation sources associated with them.<br>
One exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be explained in more detail<br>
in the following text with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows one embodiment of a weathering apparatus according to the<br>
invention;<br>
Figure 2 shows the spectral position of the three<br><br>
measurement ranges specified in the IS and NB<br>
Standards.<br>
Figure 1 shows a longitudinal section through a<br>
weathering chamber 1 in a weathering apparatus.<br>
Openings in which UV radiation sources 2 are inserted<br>
are provided in one longitudinal wall of the weathering<br>
chamber 1. In the present case, the UV radiation<br>
sources 2 are formed by xenon radiation sources. The<br>
discharge tubes, which are filled with xenon, are<br>
surrounded by metallic reflectors in a known manner in<br>
each radiation source 2, so that virtually all of the<br>
radiation emitted from the radiation source 2 enters<br>
the interior of the weathering chamber 1. Infrared<br>
filters may be placed in front of the radiation sources<br>
2 to remove the relatively high infrared component from<br>
the spectrum emitted by xenon lamps. The inner walls of<br>
the weathering chamber 1 are advantageously coated with<br>
aluminium in order to increase the degree of reflection<br>
in the UV range and thus likewise to use the UV<br>
radiation reflected on the inner walls for application<br>
to the samples.<br>
Halogen lamps, in particular metal-halogen lamps,<br>
fluorescent lamps or UV light-emitting diodes may also<br>
be used as UV radiation sources, instead of xenon<br>
lamps.<br>
A holding plate 5, which is mounted in the weathering<br>
chamber 1, is located opposite the UV radiation sources<br>
2 in order to accommodate and hold material samples 6<br>
to be weathered and temperature sensors such as a<br>
blackboard or black standard sensor 7. The beam path of<br>
the radiation emitted from the UV radiation sources 2<br>
is illustrated by means of arrows. This results in a<br>
three-dimensionally virtually constant radiation power<br>
on the plane of the material samples 5.<br><br>
Sensors 3 and 4 are provided for the measurement of the<br>
UV radiation power, and are inserted into openings in a<br>
wall of the weathering chamber 1, with this wall being<br>
located at right angles to that wall of the weathering<br>
chamber 1 to which the UV radiation sources 2 are<br>
fitted. The sensors 3 and 4 are thus inclined at an<br>
angle to the UV radiation sources 2.<br>
In the present exemplary embodiment, the weathering<br>
apparatus has three UV radiation sources 2. Each of the<br>
three UV radiation sources 2 has a respectively<br>
associated broadband UV sensor 3, which has a<br>
sensitivity range from 300 nm to 400 nm and whose<br>
output signal is thus a measure of the radiation power<br>
emitted by the respectively associated UV radiation<br>
source 2 in this spectral range.<br>
The weathering apparatus can thus carry out weathering<br>
processes with the UV radiation power being measured<br>
progressively using the IS Standard, that is to say for<br>
the UV bandwidth from 300 nm to 400 nm. However,<br>
according to the invention, the weathering apparatus is<br>
intended to be able to additionally record the<br>
weathering process for measurement purposes using<br>
different radiation power data in other bandwidths. For<br>
this purpose, one of the UV sensors 3 is calibrated not<br>
only for the range from 300 nm to 400 nm but<br>
additionally for the spectral range from 330 nm to<br>
350 nm, which is within this spectral range. In<br>
Figure 2, the sensitivity range of the UV sensors 3 and<br>
the spectral range of 340 nm ± 10 nm, which is<br>
contained in this range, are represented by the curves<br>
IS and NB1. By way of example, the relevant UV sensor 3<br>
will have been calibrated in advance by means of a UV<br>
radiation source and a narrowband UV sensor for the<br>
range from 330 nm to 350 nm, in such a way that a<br>
conversion factor for the radiation power in the<br>
narrowband range is determined from its output signal<br><br>
for the broadband range. This conversion factor may<br>
turn out to be a constant parameter from this<br>
calibration; however, it is also possible for the<br>
conversion factor to be a variable parameter, so that a<br>
different conversion factor must be used for<br>
calculation of the radiation power in the narrowband<br>
range for each output signal from the UV sensor 3 for<br>
the broadband range.<br>
The relevant UV sensor 3 may in this case likewise be<br>
calibrated by means of one of the UV radiation sources<br>
2 within the weathering chamber 1 in the weathering<br>
apparatus, in which case the UV sensor 3 and a<br>
narrowband UV sensor for the range from 330 nm to<br>
350 nm are subjected to the UV radiation from one of<br>
the UV radiation sources, and the output signals from<br>
the UV sensors are compared with one another, while the<br>
radiation power from the UV radiation source is being<br>
varied, with the conversion factor being determined in<br>
this way.<br>
This calibration, which is carried out in advance using<br>
one of the UV sensors 3, in the range 340 nm ± 10 nm<br>
can then also be used for the other UV sensors 3 during<br>
a weathering process, with their output signal for the<br>
broadband range being converted by means of the<br>
conversion factor to a radiation power in the<br>
narrowband range. The three existing UV sensors 3 can<br>
thus be used to carry out a weathering process, with<br>
the UV radiation power of the three UV sensors 3 in<br>
this case being recorded in the broadband range or in<br>
the narrowband range.<br>
Additionally or as an alternative to this, it is<br>
possible to provide the capability to record the UV<br>
radiation power in a narrowband range at 420 nm ± 10 nm<br>
according to the NB Standard. This range is outside the<br>
UV, and the broadband sensitivity range from 300 nm to<br><br>
400 nm of the UV sensors 3, as can be seen from the<br>
curve NB2 in Figure 2. An additional sensor 4, which<br>
has a sensitivity range from 410 nm to 430 nm, is thus<br>
arranged within the weathering chamber 1 and is<br>
positioned in such a way that it records only the<br>
radiation from one specific UV radiation source 2. As<br>
illustrated, it can be placed, in an opening in the side<br>
wall, in such a way that it is positioned above the UV<br>
sensor 3 associated with this UV radiation source 2<br>
and, like this, is aligned at an inclined angle with<br>
respect to the UV radiation source 2. During a<br>
weathering process, these two sensors 3 and 4 thus<br>
measure the radiation power emitted from the UV<br>
radiation source 2 associated with them in the<br>
broadband range and in the narrowband range. This UV<br>
radiation source is used, so to speak, as a reference<br>
radiation source. Only the broadband UV sensors 3 are<br>
associated with the other UV radiation sources 2, so<br>
that, initially, they directly measure only the<br>
radiation power in the broadband range. However, the<br>
broadband radiation power measured by them can be used<br>
to deduce the radiation power in the narrowband range<br>
by relating the radiation powers UV300-400 and VIS420<br>
measured by the first sensor 3 and the second sensor 4<br>
of the reference radiation source, and by applying them<br>
to the broadband radiation power, in particular<br>
multiplying them by this. Within certain tolerances,<br>
there is a fixed ratio between VIS420/UV300-400. This<br>
value determined for the reference radiation source can<br>
be multiplied by the UV300-400 values of the other<br>
radiation sources in order to calculate their VIS420<br>
values.<br>
It is thus possible to record the radiation powers of<br>
the UV radiation sources 2 by the use of only one<br>
additional sensor 4 during a weathering process in<br>
accordance with the NB Standard, for the narrowband UV<br>
range 420 nm ± 10 nm, as well.<br><br>
Thus, when using both aspects of the invention in the<br>
described exemplary embodiment, just four sensors are<br>
sufficient instead of nine sensors as in the prior art.<br>
In general terms, where 3N sensors are required in the<br>
prior art for the N radiation sources, 2N-1 sensors can<br>
be saved according to the invention, since only N+l<br>
sensors are required.<br><br>
