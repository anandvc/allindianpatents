				<td>MUSCARINIC M1 RECEPTOR AGONISTS FOR PAIN MANAGEMENT<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to neuropathic pain. More specifically, the<br>
present invention relates to the treatment of neuropathic pain by selectively interacting with<br>
muscarinic receptor subtyjpes.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
[0002] In many patients, damage to sensory nerves is accompanied by varying degrees<br>
of pain. The experience can range from mild increased sensitivity to touch or temperature to<br>
excruciating pain. This kind of pain is termed neuropathic pain because it is thought to involve an<br>
alteration in nervous system function or a reorganization of nervous system structure. Neuropathic<br>
pain is extremely difficult to manage clinically, is usually chronic, and fails to respond to standard<br>
analgesic interventions.<br>
[0003] Approximately 1.5% of the US population may suffer from neuropathic pain of<br>
one kind or another. This population is larger if one includes the many forms of back pain that are<br>
neurogenic in origin. Thus, neuropathic pain can be associated with nerve damage caused by<br>
trauma, by diseases such as diabetes, herpes zoster (shingles), irritable bowel syndrome, late-stage<br>
cancer, or by chemical injury (for example, as an untoward consequence of drug therapies including<br>
the antiviral drugs).<br>
[0004] Importantly, drugs that are effective in treating inflammatory and acute pain<br>
usually are not effective in treating neuropathic pain (such as opiates and nonsteroidal anti-<br>
inflammatory agents). Conversely, compounds that alleviate neuropathic pain may not be effective<br>
in treating acute pain (for example, gapapentin, tricylic antidepressants). The currently available<br>
treatments for neuropathic pain are not expressly designed to treat these kinds of pain and therefore,<br>
not surprisingly these drugs are not highly efficacious nor do these drugs work in all patients. Thus,<br>
there is pressing need for more effective and more tolerated treatments for neuropathic pain.<br>
[0005] One class of molecules that shows promise in managing neuropathic pain are<br>
those molecules that interact directly or indirectly with muscannic receptors. For example, blockade<br>
of acetylcholinesterase (ACHE-I) activity elevates acetylcholinc levels by preventing its<br>
degradation and secondarily leads to the simultaneous activation of all cholinergic receptors.<br>
[0006] In humans, drugs that inhibit cholinesterase activity are effective analgesic<br>
agents. For example, the ACHE-1 physostigmine causes a short acting analgesia in surgical patients<br>
when administered postoperatively. Inirathecal administration of another chemically-related<br>
ACHE-I/ neostigmine, relieves acute postoperative pain, chronic neuropathic pain and potentiates<br>
the analgesic activity of intrathecally administered opiates. Of the different cholinergic receptors,<br><br>
both muscarinic and nicotinic receptors have been suggested to mediate the antinociceptive and<br>
allodynic response of cholinesterase inhibitors. However, the antialiodynic effects of<br>
physostigmine were blocked by muscarinic receptor antagonists but not by nicotinic receptor<br>
antagonists, suggesting that the effects of cholinesterase inhibition on this form of pain are<br>
mediated through muscarinic and not nicotinic receptor activation.<br>
[0007] Direct acting muscarinic receptor agonists also are antinociceptive in a variety<br>
of animal models of acute pain (Bartolini et al., 1992; Brodie and Proudfit, 1984; Capone et al.,<br>
1999; Hartvig et al., 1989; Pedigo et al, 1975; Przewlocka et al., 1999; Shannon et al., 1997;<br>
Sheardown et al., 1997). These effects can be blocked by muscarinic antagonists (Bartolini et al.,<br>
1992; Hwang et al., 1999; Naguib and Yaksh, 1997; Sheardown et al. 1997). These data further<br>
support the role for muscarinic receptor activation in the control of acute pain states.<br>
[0008] Few studies have examined the role of muscarinic receptor activation in<br>
chronic or neuropathic pain states. In these studies, the direct and indirect elevation of cholinergic<br>
tone was shown to ameliorate tactile allodynia after intrathecal administration in a spinal ligation<br>
model of neuropathic pain in rats and these effects again were reversed by muscarinic antagonists<br>
(Hwang et al., 1999; Lee et al, 2002). Thus, direct or indirect activation of muscarinic receptors has<br>
been shown to elicit both acute analgesic activity and to ameliorate neuropathic pain. Muscarinic<br>
agonists and ACHE-ls are not widely used clinically owing to their propensity to induced a plethora<br>
of adverse events when administered to humans. The undesirable side-effects include excessive<br>
salivation and sweating, enhanced gastrointestinal motility, and bradycardia among other adverse<br>
events. These side-effects are associated with the ubiquitous expression of the muscarinic family of<br>
receptors throughout the body.	'	'y<br>
[0009] With the discovery of 5 genetically unique muscarinic receptors, M(l)-M(5),<br>
with differential distributions in the body in the mid-1980s, it became possible to conceive of<br>
designing molecules that selectively interact with one of these receptor subtypes and not the others.<br>
It was thought that the design of selective molecules would permit modulation, for example, of<br>
muscarinic receptors controlling central nervous function without also activating muscarinic<br>
receptors controlling cardiac, gastrointestinal or glandular functions. Despite enormous effort, no<br>
drugs with this desired selectivity have been developed resulting principally from the structural<br>
similarity of important activation regions of these 5 receptor subtypes.<br>
[0010] Also, it is not known which of the 5 muscarinic receptor subtypes mediate the<br>
effects of muscarinic compounds on various pain states. Indeed, it is possible that activation of<br>
more than one muscarinic receptor subtype may be involved in pain control or that activation of<br>
different muscarinic receptor subtypes may mediate different forms of pain. For example, the M(2)<br>
receptor is highly expressed in the dorsal root ganglion in the small-medium type neurons, in the<br>
dorsal horn of the spinal cord and the thalamus, suggesting that actuation of M(2) receptors may<br>
participate in the modulation of the transduction of noxious stimuli from the periphery through the<br><br>
spinal cord to the brain. This hypothesis was confirmed by the finding that deletion of the M(2)<br>
receptors in mice reduces the acute antinociceptive activity of mucarinic agonists. Additionally,<br>
based on deletions of other muscarinic receptor subtypes in mice, only the M(2), and perhaps to a<br>
lesser extent M(4), receptors appear to contribute the acute analgesic activity of muscarinic<br>
agonists. Others have reached a similar conclusion: "These data provide unambiguous evidence<br>
that muscarinic analgesia is exclusively mediated by a combination of M(2) and M(4) muscarinic<br>
receptors at both spinal and supraspinal sites" (Duttaroy A, et al, 2002). Further, still others have<br>
noted: "However, activity at the M(l) receptor subtype is not a requirement for antinociceptive<br>
activity" (Sheardown, et al, 1997).<br>
[0011] Notwithstanding these data, the therapeutic utility of a compound acting<br>
directly at M(2) receptors is limited. This is because the M(2) receptor also is highly expressed in<br>
the heart and the GI tract, suggesting that this receptor also mediates the gastrointestinal distress<br>
and cardiovascular side effects of muscarinic receptors. Again, this suggestion was confirmed in<br>
mice with deletions of the M(2) receptor. Thus, agents that directly or indirectly activate M(2)<br>
muscarinic receptors might not be useful in even treating acute pain due to unwanted and<br>
potentially dangerous side-effects.<br>
[0012] A similar scientific compendium is not available for neuropathic pain. The<br>
precise muscarinic receptor subtype mediating the activity of direct and indirect muscarinic agonists<br>
in neuropathic pain states clearly is not known. There is a strong medical need to determine the<br>
muscarinic receptor subtype(s) that are involved in ameliorating neuropathic pain and to develop<br>
drugs that selectively activate these receptors.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
[0019] Compounds have been developed with unprecedented selectivity for the M(l)<br>
receptor relative to other n-.uscarinic receptor subtypes (Spalding TA, Trotter C, Skjaerbaek N,<br>
Messier TL, Currier EA, Burstein ES, Li D, Hacksell U, Brann MR. Discovery of an ectopic<br>
activation site on the M(l) muscarinic receptor. Mol. Pharmacol, 61(6): 1297-302, 2002; U.S. Appl<br><br>
No. 10/262,517 (publication number 20030100545), entitled, "Benzimidazolidinone Derivatives as<br>
Muscarinic Agents"; U.S. Patent No. 6,627,645, entitled, "Muscarinic Agonists"; U.S. Patent No.<br>

Receptors"; U.S. Appl. No. 10/329,455 (publication number 20030176418), entitled,<br>
"Tetrahydroisoquinoiine Analogues as Muscarinic Agonists"; and U.S. Provisional No. 60/432,692,<br>
entitled, "Piperidinyl Dimers as Muscarinic Agents".<br>
[0020] Compounds with relative selectivity for the M(l) muscarinic receptor have<br>
been discovered to be very effective in ameliorating thermal hyperalgesia and tactile allodynia in<br>
rodent models of neuropathic pain when administered systemically. Because these compounds also<br>
do not activate other muscarinic receptor subtypes, these M(l) agonists do not elicit the undesirable<br>
and life-threatening actions of previous nonselective muscarinic agonists. M(l) selective agonists,<br>
therefore, are particularly attractive as therapies for treating chronic neuropathic pain. Conversely,<br>
unlike nonselective muscarinic agonists that interact with M(2) and all other muscarinic receptor<br>
subtypes, these M(l) selective agonist are not effective in reducing acute pain. Thus, selective<br>
M(l) agonists have a particularly attractive profile in rodents. They block neuropathic pain but do<br>
not alter response to other forms of pain. In chronic use, these agents should allow patients to<br>
respond normally to acute pain while at the same time blocking chronic neuropathic pain.<br>
[0021] As used herein, the term "selective" is defined as a property of a compound<br>
whereby an amount of the compound sufficient to effect a desired response from a particular<br>
receptor type, subtype, class or subclass with significantly less or substantially little or no effect<br>
upon the activity of other receptor types. For example, a selective compound may have at least a<br>
10-fold greater effect on activity of the desired receptor than on other receptor types. In some<br>
cases, a selective compound may have at least a 20-fold greater effect on activity of the desired<br>
receptor than on other receptor types, or at least a 50-fold greater effect, or at least a 100-fold<br>
greater effect, or at least a 1000-fold greater effect, or at least a 10,000-fold greater effect, or at least<br>
a 100,000-fold greater effect, or more than a 100,000-fold greater effect.<br>
[0022] The site of action of M(l) agonist effects on neuropathic pain remain to be<br>
elucidated. Yet, the neuropathic pain relieving effects of M(l) selective agonists have been shown<br>
to be blocked by the central nervous system penetrating muscarinic antagonist scopolaminc<br>
hydrochloride but not by the mainly peripheral-acting muscarinic antagonist methylscopolamine<br>
hydrochlonde. This suggests that the neuropathic pain relieving effects of M(l) selective<br>
muscarinic agonists are mediated through action in the central nervous system Further, these M(l)<br>
selective agonists are not effective in alleviating neuropathic pain when administered intrathecaily<br>
into the spinal cord but are effective alleviating this form of pain when administered<br>
intracerebroventricularly. This suggests that the neuropathic pain relieving effects of M(l) receptor<br>
activation are mediated by supraspinal and not necessarily spinal sites of action.<br><br>
[0023] Compounds that interact with the M(l) receptor subtype possess heretofore<br>
unappreciated analgesic activity and are effective treatments for neuropathic pain. These<br>
observations have practical applications that support the use of M(l) agonists in the treatment of<br>
neuropathic pain caused by trauma, by diseases such as diabetes, herpes zoster (shingles), irritable<br>
bowel syndrome or late-stage cancer, or by chemical injury (for example, as an untoward<br>
consequence of drug therapies including the antiviral drugs).<br>
[0024] Thus, in some embodiments of the present invention, neuropathic pain in an<br>
organism is treated by contacting a subject with a pharmacologically active dose of a compound<br>
that interacts with the M(l) receptor subtype for the purpose of controlling pain without also<br>
causing unwanted and utility limiting side-effects.<br>

selectively interacts with the M(l) receptor subtype.<br>

and the compounds of Formulas VIII and IX, which are disclosed in U.S. Appl. No. 10/329,455<br>
(publication number 20030176418).<br>
[0058] In some embodiments, the compounds for use in the present invention include<br>
the compound of Formula VII, which is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,627,645,<br><br><br><br>
[0059] Certain of the compounds of the present invention may exist as stereoisomers<br>
including optical isomers. The invention includes all stereoisomers and both the racemic mixtures<br>
of such stereoisomers as well as the individual enantiomers that may be separated according to<br>
methods that are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
[0060] Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts include inorganic and<br>
organic acid addition salts such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, phosphate, sulphate, acetate,<br>
citrate, lactate, tartrate, maleate, fumarate, mandelate and oxalate; and inorganic and organic base<br>
addition salts with bases such as sodium hydroxy and Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (TRiS,<br>
tromethane).<br>
[0061] in addition to administering a compound as a raw chemical, the compounds of<br>
the invention may be administered as part of a pharmaceutical preparation containing suitable<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers comprising excipients and auxiliaries which facilitate<br>
processing of the compounds into preparations which can be used pharmaceutically. Preferably, the<br>
preparations, particularly those preparations which can be administered orally or topically and<br>
which can be used for the preferred type of administration, such as tablets, dragees, slow release<br>
lozenges and capsules, mouth rinses and mouth washes, gels, liquid suspensions, hair rinses, hair<br>
gels, shampoos and also preparations which can be administered rectally, such as suppositories, as<br>
well as suitable solutions for administration by injection, topically or orally, contain from about<br>
0.01 to 99 percent, preferably from about 0.25 to 75 percent of active compound(s), together with<br>
the excipient.<br>
|0062] Also included within the scope of the present invention are the non-toxic<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of the present invention. Acid addition salts<br>
are formed by mixing a solution of the Ml receptor agonists described herein with a solution of a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic acid such as hydrochloric acid, fumanc acid, maleic acid,<br>
succinic acid, acetic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, carbonic acid, phosphoric acid, oxalic acid, and<br>
the like. Basic salts are formed by mixing a solution of the particular Ml receptor described herein<br>
with a solution of a pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic base such as sodium hydroxide,<br>
potassium hydroxide, chohne hydroxide, sodium carbonate Tns and the like.<br>
|0063| The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be administered to any<br>
animal which may experience the beneficial effects of the compounds of the invention. Foremost<br><br>
among such animals are mammals, for example, humans, although the invention is not intended to<br>
be so limited.<br>
[0064] The Ml receptor agonists and pharmaceutical compositions thereof may be<br>
administered by any means that achieve their intended purpose. For example, administration may<br>
be by parenteral, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, transdermal, buccal,<br>
intrathecal, intracranial, intranasal or topical routes. Alternatively, or concurrently, administration<br>
may be by the oral route. The dosage administered will be dependent upon the age, health, and<br>
weight of the recipient, kind of concurrent treatment, if any, frequency of treatment, and the nature<br>
of the effect desired.<br>
[0065] The pharmaceutical preparations of the Ivt 1 receptor agonists described herein<br>
are manufactured vn a manner which is itself known, for example, by means of conventional<br>
mixing, granulating, dragee-making, dissolving, or lyophilizing processes. Thus, pharmaceutical<br>
preparations for oral use can be obtained by combining the active compounds with solid excipients,<br>
optionally grinding the resulting mixture and processing the mixture of granules, after adding<br>
suitable auxiliaries, if desired or necessary, to obtain tablets or dragee cores.<br>
[0066] Suitable excipients are, in particular, fillers such as saccharides, for example<br>
lactose or sucrose, mannitol or sorbitol, cellulose preparations and/or calcium phosphates, for<br>
example tricalcium phosphate or calcium hydrogen phosphate, as well as binders such as starch<br>
paste, using, for example, maize starch, wheat starch, rice starch, potato starch, gelatin, tragacanth,<br>
methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and/or polyvinyl<br>
pyrrolidone. If desired, disintegrating agents may be added such as the above-mentioned starches<br>
and also carboxymethyl-starch, cross-linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, agar, or alginic acid or a salt<br>
thereof, such as sodium alginate. Auxiliaries are, above all, flow-regulating agents and lubricants,<br>
for example, silica, talc, stearic acid or salts thereof, such as magnesium slearate or calcium<br>
stearate, and/or polyethylene glycol. Dragee cores are provided with suitable coatings which, if<br>
desired, are resistant to gastric juices. For this purpose, concentrated saccharide solutions may be<br>
used, which may optionally contain gum arabic, talc, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyethylene glycol<br>
and/or titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions and suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures. In<br>
order to produce coatings resistant to gastric juices, solutions of suitable cellulose preparations such<br>
as acetylcellulose phthalate or hydroxypropymethyl-cellulose phthalate, are used. Dye stuffs or<br>
pigments may be added to the tablets or dragee coatings, for example, for identification or in order<br>
to characterize combinations of active compound doses.<br>
[0067] Other pharmaceutical preparations which can be used orally include push- fit<br>
capsules made of gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a plasticizer such as<br>
glycerol or sorbitol. The push-fit capsules can contain the active compounds in the form of<br>
granules which may be mixed with fillers such as lactose, binders such as starches, and/or<br>
lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate and, optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the<br><br>
active compounds are preferably dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, or<br>
liquid paraffin. In addition, stabilizers may be added.<br>
[0068] Possible pharmaceutical preparations which can be used rectally include, for<br>
example, enemas or suppositories, which consist of a combination of one or more of the active<br>
compounds with a suppository base. Suitable suppository bases are, for example, natural or<br>
synthetic triglycerides, or paraffin hydrocarbons. In addition, it is also possible to use gelatin rectal<br>
capsules that consist of a combination of the active compounds with a base. Possible base materials<br>
include, for example, liquid triglycerides, polyethylene glycols, or paraffin hydrocarbons.<br>
[0069] Suitable formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions<br>
of the active compounds in water-soluble form, for example, water-soluble salts and alkaline<br>
solutions. In addition, suspensions of the active compounds as appropriate oily injection<br>
suspensions may be administered. Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils, for<br>
example, sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, for example, ethyl oleate or triglycendes or<br>
polyethylene glycol-400 (the compounds are soluble in PEG-400). Aqueous injection suspensions<br>
may contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension include, for example, sodium<br>
carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, and/or dextran. Optionally, the suspension may also contain<br>
stabilizers.<br>
[0070] Compositions within the scope of this invention include all compositions<br>
wherein the compounds described herein are contained in an amount effective to achieve its<br>
intended purpose. While individual needs vary, determination of optimal ranges of effective<br>
amounts of each component is within the skill of the art. Typically, the compounds may be<br>
administered to mammals, for example, humans, orally at a dose of 0.0025 to 50 mg/kg, or an<br>
equivalent amount of the pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, per day of the body weight of the<br>
mammal being treated. Preferably, about 0.01 to about 10 mg/kg is orally administered. Foi<br>
intramuscular injection, the dose is generally about one-half of the oral dose.<br>
[0071] The unit oral dose may comprise from about 0.01 to about 50 mg, preferably<br>
about 0.1 to about 10 mg of the compound. The unit dose may be administered one or more times<br>
daily as one or more tablets each containing from about 0.1 to about 10, conveniently about 0.25 to<br>
50 mg of the compound or its solvates.<br>
[0072] In a topical formulation, the compound may be present at a concentration of<br>
about 0.01 to 100 mg per gram of carrier. In a preferred embodiment, the compound is present at a<br>
concentration of about 0.07-1.0 mg/ml, more preferably, about 0.1-0.5 mg/ml, most preferably,<br>
about 0.4 mg/ml.<br>
[0073] The following examples are set forth so as to provide those of ordinary skill in<br>
the art with a complete disclosure and description of how to make and use the present invention,<br>
and are not intended to limit the scope of what the inventors regard as their invention nor are they<br>
intended to represent that the experiments below are all or the only experiments performed.<br><br>
Example 1<br>
[0074] The functional receptor assay, Receptor Selection and Amplification<br>
Technology (R-SAT), essentially as disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,707,798, 5,912,132, and<br>
5,955,281, was used to investigate the pharmacological properties of known and novel muscarinic<br>
agonists. Accordingly, xanomeline, oxotremorine, milameline, and the compounds of formulas<br>
VII, VIII, and IX were tested.<br>
[0075] These experiments have provided a molecular profile, or fingerprint, for each<br>
of these agents across the most meaningful receptors, the M(l) and M(2) muscarinic receptor<br>
subtypes. As can be seen in Table 1, the three reference agents, xanomeline, oxotremorine and<br>
milameline, are potent and efficacious full agonists at both the M(l) and M(2) receptor subtypes. In<br>
contrast, the compounds of Formulas VII, VIII, and IX are potent and efficacious M(l) agonist but<br>
only weak partial agonists at M(2) receptors.<br>

CC I/Thermal Hvperalgesia<br>
[0076] Rats were anesthetized under aseptic and heated conditions using a<br>
combination of 1.6 ml ketamine (lOOmg/ml) and 1.6 ml xylazine (lOOmg/ml) in 6.8 ml 0.9% saline<br>
at a volume of O.lml/lOOg. The left quadriceps was shaved and scrubbed thoroughly with an iodine<br>
solution. The sciatic nerve was exposed at the level of the sciatic notch distally to the sciatic<br>
trifurcation. The nerve was very carefully freed from the underlying muscle and connective tissue<br>
without causing trauma to the nerve itself. Using 4-0 chromic catgut sutuic niaterial, four semi-<br>
loose ligatures were tied around the sciatic nerve starting at the most proximal level, next to the<br>
sciatic notch, spaced roughly 1 mm apart and ending proximal to the sciatic trifurcation. Under<br><br>
magnification the ligatures were tightened until a slight twitch was observed in the animals left paw<br>
or musculature surrounding the nerve. The muscular incision was closed with 4-0 silk suture<br>
material and the skin was stapled with wound clips. The animals were closely observed until they<br>
recovered completely from the anesthetic. The surgery was the same for the hyperalgesia and<br>
allodynia experiments.<br>
[0077] For hyperalgesia testing, rats were placed in a tinted plastic box on top of a<br>
clear glass, temperature-regulated floor maintained at 31 ±1 °C. The floor contained a focal radiant<br>
heat source (halogen projection lamp CXL/CXP, 50 W, 8v, USHIO, Tokyo). The heat source was<br>
moveable beneath the glass and had a radiant beam of approximately 3 mm in diameter, that could<br>
be positioned under the plantar surface of the rat hind paw.<br>
[0078] To initiate the test, rats were placed in the tinted boxes and allowed 10-20<br>
minutes to acclimate to the new environment. The radiant heat source was then positioned under<br>
the plantar surface of the hind paw. Upon activation of the heat source, a timer was simultaneously<br>
triggered. Upon reflex movement of the hind paw, a motion sensor was activated stopping the<br>
timer and inactivating the heat source. The thermal source was adjusted so that the average response<br>
latency for an uninjured animal was no greater than 20 seconds. Each rat had two days of pre-<br>
operative baseline latency measurements in which the left rear hind paw plantar surface was<br>
measured three to four times. Two to three left postoperative baseline latency measurements were<br>
taken before and after the treatment was given. Postoperative day 2 and 4 measurements yielded<br>
the greatest degree of hyperalgesia and thus were utilized in this assay. Each animal was tested<br>
twice with at least 48 hours separating each test.<br>
[0079] Thermal hyperalgesia developed in the surgical-treated left paw as evidenced<br>
by a decrease in paw withdrawal latencies to a thermal stimulus. The maximal hyperalgesia<br>
occurred on post-operative days 2 through 4. Paw withdrawal latencies on the surgically-treated<br>
left side gradually returned to baseline levels over the course of 5 to 12 days post-surgery. The<br>
surgically untreated right paw was not significantly affected by surgery as evidenced by similar paw<br>
withdrawal latencies throughout the 12 days of testing.<br>
[0080] Vehicle administration in each group did not alter the thermal hyperalgesia. In<br>
contrast, the reference muscarinic agonists dose dependently reversed thermal hyperalgesia (Table<br>
1). Xanomeline reversed the thermal hyperalgesia [F (2,15) = 57.43, p 
comparison revealed that xanomeline reversed thermal hyperalgesia at 10 mg/kg (p
3 mg/kg (p &gt; 0.05) relative to vehicle. Oxotremorine also reversed thermal hyperalgesia [F (2,11)<br>
= 13.74, p = 0.0018]. Post-hoc comparison demonstrated that paw withdrawal latencies after<br>
oxotremorine administration at 1 mg/kg (18.468 ± 1.532 s; p-" 0001) and 0.3 mg/kg (13.683 s l<br>

Formula VIII, F(2,23) = 6.066, p = 0.0041; Formula IX, [F (4,24) = 14.51, p 
post-hoc comparison revealed that the compounds of Formulas VII, VIII, and IX reversed thermal<br>
hyperalgesia at 10 mg/kg (p
CCI / Tactile AUodvnia<br>
[0082] The onset and duration of significant mechanical allodynia post CCI surgery is<br>
approximately 10-14 days and lasts for roughly two months. Within this allodynic time frame, and<br>
for each specific allodynia experiment, pre and post drug administration measurements were taken<br>
with seven von Frey hairs which are designated by log (10* force required to bend hair, mg) and<br>
ranged from 2-26 grams (#'s 4.31 - 5.46). Each hair was pressed perpendicularly against the left<br>
injured plantar mid -hind paw surface with sufficient force to cause a slight bending, and was held<br>
for 6-8 seconds starting with the thinnest gauged hair and working up to the thickest. A positive<br>
response was recorded when the injured paw was sharply withdrawn, and this response was<br>
confirmed as positive by testing the next thickest gauged hair for the same response. Only when a<br>
response was seen twice was the score accepted. If the maximum gram force of 26 was reached<br>
without a response, this was considered the peak threshold cutoff for allodynic behavior and the<br>
score was recorded. Animals were considered allodynic when the post surgery baseline<br>
measurements were 6 grams and below. Two baseline days of measurements were taken with one<br>
round of testing occurring per day. On the day of drug testing, one round of baseline measurements<br>
were taken, the appropriate pretreatment was administered i.p. and a second round of<br>
measurements were recorded. Each animal was utilized in multiple experiments, with one<br>
treatment per experiment, and an appropriate washout period in between experiments.<br>
[0083] Significant tactile allodynia was seen starting on day 8 and continuing through<br>
day 35-post surgery. Assessment of tactile responsiviry after these muscarinic agonists was<br>
performed within these post surgical time points. In the vehicle treated group post injury pre-<br>
treatment scores were not statistically significant from base line, [F (2,95) = i .275, p &gt; 0.05]. The<br>
three reference muscarinic agonist also dose dependently reversed tactile allodynia. Xanomeline<br>
reversed tactile allodynia, [F (3,22) = 12.58, p 
Oxotremorine also reversed tactile allodynia [F (3,19) = 32.49, p

[0084] Again, like the reference muscarinic agonists, the compounds of Formulas VII,<br>
VIII, and IX dose dependently reversed tactile allodynia: Formula VII, F(3,20) = 29.11, p 
Formula VIII, F(3,23) = 11.764, p 
post-hoc comparison revealed that Formula VII reversed tactile allodynia at 10 mg/kg (p
Formula VIII reversed tactile allodynia at 30 mg/kg (p = 0.08) and Formula IX reversed tactile<br>
allodynia at 17.8 mg/kg (p 
Acute Thermal Analgesia<br>
[85]	Water was heated and maintained at 55°C ± 1°C with a probe regulated hot<br>
plate. Female rats weighing approximately 200 g - 250 g were acclimated days in advance by<br>
placing them into and removing them from a plastic rat restrainer. On the day of the experiment<br>
each rat was placed in the restrainer 1 minute before the test was performed. Roughly one inch of<br>
the tail was submerged into the water as a timer was initiated. Once the tail was completely<br>
removed from the water, the timer was stopped and the time was recorded. If the animal did not<br>
respond within 10 seconds, the experimenter removed the tail from the heated water and recorded<br>
this as the maximum score. One round of baseline measurements were collected. The test<br>
compound was administered and after the appropriate pretreatment interval, the procedure was<br>
repeated. Each animal was utilized in multiple experiments, with one treatment per experiment,<br>
and an appropriate washout period of at least 48 hours between experiments. The effects of test<br>
compounds on acute nociception are shown in Table 1. The pre-treatment baseline tail withdrawal<br>
latency average was 2.281 s ± 0.25. Vehicle administration did not alter tail withdrawal latencies<br>
with an average latency of 3.16 s ± 0.21. Xanomeline [F (2,16) = 4.952, p

antinociception. Xanomeline only was active at the 10.0 mg/kg dose, oxotremorine at the 0.3<br>
mg/kg and 1.0 mg/kg doses and milameline at the 1.0 mg/kg dose. At a dose of 10 mg/kg, morphine<br>
[F(3,23) = 5.903, p 
[86]	Surprisingly, the compounds of Formulas VII, VIII, and IX were found to be<br>
not active in alleviating acute thermal pain (Table 1). Thus, the compounds of Formulas VII, VIII,<br>
and DC reverse chronic neuropathic pain but are not acutely antinociceptive.<br>
Example 2<br>
Muscannic Side Effects<br>
[0087] All of the reference muscarinic receptor agonists tested produced cholinergic<br>
side effects as shown in Table 2. The number of animals exhibiting each side effect at each dose is<br>
shown compared to the number of animals tested (N). Xanomeline at a dose of 30 mg/kg produced<br>
diarrhea, salivation, and lethargy in all animals tested at this dose, whereas the lower dose of 10<br>
mg/kg only produced diarrhea in 2 of 11 animals tested. Oxotremorine at a dose of I mg/kg<br>
produced all five of the measured muscarinic side effects in the majority of the rats, where as 0.3<br>
mg/kg produced only diarrhea, salivation and lethargy. Milameline at I mg/kg, like oxotTemonne,<br><br>
produced four of the measured side effects but not tremors, where as the lower dose of 0.3 mg/kg<br>
produced predominately diarrhea. In contrast, none of the compounds of Formulas VII, VIII, or IX<br>
produced any of these side-effects at doses between 3.0 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg. Thus, the reference<br>
muscarinic agonists produce severe muscarinic mediated side-effects at doses similar to those<br>
required to produce efficacy in these pain models whereas the compounds of Formulas VII, VIII,<br>
and IX do not produce these side-effects at doses that efficacious in the neuropathic pain models.<br><br>
Example 3<br>
Partial Sciatic Ligation (PSD Surgery/ Tactile AUodynia<br>
[0088] Male mice (C57B1/6) were anesthetized using 1% Isoflurane (1 Lpm)<br>
inhalation anesthetic under aseptic and heated conditions. The left quadriceps was shaved and<br>
scrubbed thoroughly with an iodine solution. The sciatic notch was palpated and an incision made<br>
from the notch to mid quadriceps. The sciatic nerve was exposed at the level of the sciatic notch<br>
distally to the sciatic trifurcation. The nerve was carefully freed from the underlying muscle and<br>
connective tissue without causing trauma to the nerve itself. When necessary sterile saline was<br>
applied to the exposed tissue to prevent it from drying out. Using 10-0 polypropelene blue<br>
monofilament suture, the sciatic nerve was perforated immediately distal to the sciatic notch and<br>
ligation tied to occlude 1/3 to 1/2 of the sciatic nerve. Under magnification the ligature was<br>
tightened until a slight twitch was observed in the animals left paw. The muscular incision was<br>
closed, when necessary, with 7-0 polypropelene suture and the skin was stapled with wound clips.<br>
Post-opertative buprenex was administered at 0.075mg/kg SC. The animals were closely observed<br>
until they recovered completely from the anesthetic.<br>
[0089] The onset for significant tactile allodynia post PSI. surgery is approximately 4-<br>
6 days and lasts for roughly one month. Within this allodynic time frame, and for each specific<br>
allodynia experiment, pre and post drug administration measurements were taken with eight von<br><br>
Frey hairs which are designated by log (10* force required to bend hair) and ranged from 0-07 - 4<br>
grams. Each hair was pressed perpendicularly against the left injured plantar mid hind paw surface<br>
with sufficient force to cause a slight bend in the hair, and was held for 6-8 seconds starting with<br>
the thinnest gauged hair and working up to the thickest. A positive response was recorded when the<br>
injured paw was sharply withdrawn, and this response was confirmed positive by testing the next<br>
thickest gauged hair for the same response. Only when this response was seen twice was the score<br>
accepted from the hair that produced the initial behavioral response. If the maximum gram force of<br>
10 was reached without a response, this was considered the peak threshold cutoff for allodynic<br>
behavior and the score was recorded. Animals were considered allodynic when the post surgery<br>
baseline measurements were ~60% of presurgical baseline measurements. Two baseline days of<br>
measurements were taken with one round of testing occurring per day. On the day of drug testing,<br>
one round of baseline measurements were taken, the appropriate pretreatment was administered i.p.<br>
or sc, and a second round of measurements were recorded. Each animal was utilized in multiple<br>
experiments, with one treatment per experiment, and an appropriate washout period in between<br>
experiments.<br>
[0090] Muscarinic M(l) receptor knockout (KO) mice did not differ from wild type<br>
(WT) with respect to pre-surgery tactile sensitivity (t = 1.094, df = 15, p = 0.2913) nor with respect<br>
to post-surgery allodynia (t = 0.2338, df = 15, p = 0.8183). Both M(l) KO (t = 5.765, df = 7, p =<br>
0.0007) and WT (t = 3.551, df = 8, p = 0.0075) mice developed robust tactile allodynia following<br>
PSL surgery. However, the compound of Formula IX at 30 mg/kg significantly alleviated the<br>
tactile allodynia in WT mice, but the effects of the compound of Formula IX was completely<br>
abolished in M(l) KO mice, confirming the role for M(l) receptors in neuropathic pain in vivo<br>
Control tactile sensitivity before surgery (Pre-PSL) and after surgery (PSL) are shown in Figure 2<br>
for comparison to sensitivity after treatment with the compound of Formula IX in wild type (+/+)<br>
and M(l) receptor knockout (-/-) mice.<br>
[0091] Further, as depicted in Figure 3, the compound of Formula IX significantly<br>
reversed tactile allodynia in mice with PSL neuropathic injury after intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.)<br>
administration, suggesting a supraspinal mechanism of action consistent with M(l) receptor<br>
distribution.<br>
