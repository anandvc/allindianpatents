				<td>LIQUID PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATIONS OF FSH AND LH TOGETHER WITH A NON-IONIC SURFACTANT Field of Invention The invention relates to the field of pharmaceutical formulations of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), formulations of luteinising hormone (LH), and mixtures of FSH and luteinising hormone (LH) ; as well as to methods of producing such formulations. <br>
Background of the invention Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinising hormone (LH) and chorionic gonadotrophin (CG) are injectable proteins falling into the class of gonadotrophins. <br>
FSH, LH and hCG are used alone and in combination in the treatment of infertility and reproductive disorders in both female and male patients. <br>
In nature, FSH and LH are produced by the pituitary gland. For pharmaceutical use, FSH and LH and their variants may be produced recombinantly (rFSH and rLH), or they may be produced from the urine of postmenopausal women (uFSH and uLH). <br>
FSH is used in female patients in ovulation induction (Oi) and in controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) for assisted reproductive technologies (ART). In a typical treatment regimen for ovulation induction, a patient is administered daily injections of FSH or a variant (about 75 to 300 IU FSH/day) for a period of from about 6 to about 12 days. In a typical treatment regimen for controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, a patient is administered daily injections of FSH or a variant (about 150-600 IU FSHlday) for a period of from about 6 to about 12 days. <br>
FSH is also used to induce spermatogenesis in men suffering from oligospermia. A regimen using 150 IU FSH 3 times weekly in combination with 2'500 IU hCG twice weekly has been successful in achieving an improvement in sperm count in men suffering from hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism. <br>
LH is used in female patients in combination with FSH in Ol and in COH, particularly in those patients having very low endogenous LH levels or resistance to LH, such as women suffering from hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism (HH, WHO group 1) or older patients (i. e. 35 years or older), and patients in which embryo implantation or early miscarriage is a problem. LH in combination with FSH has traditionally been available in a preparation called human menopausal gonadotrophins (hMG) extracted from the urine of postmenopausal women. hMG has a 1: 1 ratio of FSH: LH activity. <br>
CG acts at the same receptor as LH and elicits the same responses. CG has a longer circulation half-life than LH and is therefore commonly used as a long-acting source of LH-activity. CG is used in Ol and COH regimens to mimic the natural LH peak and trigger ovulation. An injection of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) is used to trigger ovulation at the end of stimulation with FSH or a mixture of FSH and LH. CG may also be used together with FSH during stimulation for Ol and COH, in order to provide LH-activity during stimulation in patients in which LH-activity is desirable, such as those mentioned above. <br>
FSH, LH and CG are members of the heterodimer, glycoprotein hormone family that also includes thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). The members of this family are heterodimers, comprising an a-and a ß-subunit. The subunits are held together by noncovalent interactions. The human FSH (hFSH) heterodimer consists of (i) a mature 92 amino acid glycoprotein alpha subunit, which also is common to the other human family members (i. e. , chorionic gonadotrophin ("CG"), luteinising hormone ("LH") and thyroid stimulating hormone ("TSH") ; and (ii) a mature 111 amino acid beta subunit that is unique to FSH2. The human LH heterodimer consists of (i) the mature 92 amino acid glycoprotein alpha subunit; and (ii) a mature 112 beta subunit that is unique to LH3. The alpha and beta subunits of the glycoproteins may be prone to dissociate in formulations, due to interaction with a preservative, surfactant and other excipients. Dissociation of the subunits leads to loss of biological potency4. <br>
FSH is formulated for intramuscular (IM) or subcutaneous (SC) injection. FSH is supplied in lyophilised (solid) form in vials or ampoules of 75 IU/vial and 150 IU/vial with a shelf life of one and a half to two years when stored at 2-25°C. A solution for injection is formed by reconstituting the lyophilised product with water for injection (WFi). For ovulation induction or controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, daily injections with starting doses of 75 lU to 600 IU are recommended for up to about ten days. <br>
Depending on the patient's response, up to three cycles of treatment with Increasing doses of FSH can be used. With lyophilised formulations, the patient is required to reconstitute a new vial of lyophilised material with diluent and administer it immediately after reconstitution on a daily basis [Package insert N1700101A, published in February 1996, for Fertinex (urofollitropin for injection, purified) for subcutaneous injection, by Serono Laboratories, Inc., Randolph, MA]. <br>
FSH has also been formulated in both single-dose and multi-dose liquid formats, in vials, or ampoules. Single dose formats must remain stable and potent in storage prior to use. Multi-dose formats must not only remain stable and potent in storage prior to use, but must also remain stable, potent and relatively free of bacteria over the multiple-dose use regimen administration period, after the seal of the ampoule has been compromised. For this reason, multi-dose formats often contain a bacteriostatic agent. <br>
LH is formulated for intramuscular (IM) or subcutaneous (SC) injection. LH is supplied in lyophilised (solid) form in vials or ampoules of 75 IU/vial with a shelf life of one and a half to two years when stored at 2-25°C. A solution for injection is formed by reconstituting the lyophilised product with water for injection (WFI). For ovulation induction or controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, in conjunction with FSH, daily injections with starting doses of 75 IU to 600 U LH are recommended for up to about ten days. <br>

Follicle stimulating hormone, or FSH, as used herein refers to the FSH produced as a full-length mature protein which includes, but is not limited to human FSH or"hFSH", whether produced recombinantiy or isolated from human sources, such as the urine of postmenopausal women. The protein sequence of the human glycoprotein alpha subunit is provided in SEQ ID NO : 1, and the protein sequence of the human FSH beta subunit is given in SEQ D NO : 2. <br>
The expression"FSH variant"is meantto encompass those molecules differing in amino acid sequence, glycosylation pattern or in inter-subunit linkage from human FSH but exhibiting FSH-activity. Examples include CTP-FSH, a long-acting modified recombinant FSH, consisting of the wild type a-subunit and a hybrid 8-subunit in which the carboxy terminal peptide of hCG has been fused to the C-terminal of the P-subunit of FSH, as described in LaPolt et al. ; Endocrinology; 1992, 131, 2514- 2520 ; or Klein et al. ; Development and characterization of a long-acting recombinant hFSH agonist ; Human Reprod. 2003,18, 50-56]. Also included is single chain CTP- FSH, a single chain molecule, consisting of the following sequences (from N-terminal to C-terminal) : pFSH (phCG-CTP (113-145) I aFSH wherein ßFSH signifies the p-subunit of FSH, ßhCG CTP (113-145) signifies the carboxy terminal peptide of hCG and aFSH signifies the a-subunit of FSH, as described by Klein et a/. 5 Other examples of FSH variants include FSH molecules having additional glycosylation sites incorporated in the a-and/or ß-subunit, as disclosed in WO 01/58493 (Maxygen), particularly as disclosed in claims 10 and 11 of WO 01/58493, and FSH molecules with intersubunit S-S bonds, as disclosed in WO 98/58957. <br>
The FSH variants referred to herein also include the carboxy termina I deletions of the beta subunit that are shorter than the full length mature protein of SEQ ID NO : 2. <br>
Carboxy terminal deletions of the human beta subunit are provided in SEQ IDS NOS: 3,4, and 5. It is understood that the carboxy terminal variants of the beta chain form dimers with a known alpha subunit to form an FSH variant heterodimer. <br>
FSH heterodimers or FSH variant heterodimers can be produced by any suitable method, such as recombinantly, by isolation or purification from natural sources as may be the case, or by chemical synthesis, or any combination thereof. <br>
The use of the term"recombinant"refers to preparations of FSH, LH or FSH and LH variants that are produced through the use of recombinant DNA technology (see for example WO 85/01958). The sequences for genomic and cDNA clones of FSH are known for the alpha and beta subunits of several species 6 One example of a method of expressing FSH or LH using recombinant technology is by transfection of eukaryotic cells with the DNA sequences encoding an alpha and beta subunit of FSH or LH, whether provided on one vector or on two vectors with each subunit having a separate promoter, as described in European patent nos. EP 0 211 894 and EP 0 487 512. Another example of the use of recombinant technology to produce FSH or LH is by the use of homologous recombination to insert a heterologous regulatory segment in operative connection to endogenous sequences encoding the subunits of FSH or LH, as described in European patent no. EP 0 505 500 (Applied Research Systems ARS Holding NV). <br>
The FSH or FSH variant used in accordance with the present invention may be produced not only by recombinant means, including from mammalian cells, but also may be purified from other biological sources, such as from urinary sources. <br>
Acceptable methodologies include those described in Hakola, K. Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology, 127: 59-69,1997 ; Keene, et al., J. Biol. Chem. , 264: 4769- 4775,1989 ; Cerpa-Poijak, et al., Endocrinology, 132: 351-356,1993 ; Dias, et al., J. <br>

Luteinising hormone, or LH, as used herein refers to the LH produced as a full-length mature protein, which includes, but is not limited to human LH or"hLH", whether produced recombinantly or isolated from human sources, such as the urine of postmenopausal women. The protein sequence of the human glycoprotein alpha subunit is provided in SEQ ID NO: 1, and the protein sequence of the human LH beta subunit7 is given in SEQ D NO: 6. In a preferred embodiment the LH is recombinant. <br>
The expression"LH variant"is meant to encompass those molecules differing in amino acid sequence, glycosylation pattern or in nter-subunit linkage from human LH but exhibiting LH-activity. <br>
LH heterodimers or LH variant heterodimers can be produced by any suitable method, such as recombinantly, by isolation or purification from natural sources as may be the case, or by chemical synthesis, or any combination thereof. <br>
The term"administer"or"administering"means to introduce a formulation of the present invention into the body of a patient in need thereof to treat a disease or condition. <br>
The term"patient"means a mammal that is treated for a disease or condition. <br>
Patients are of, but not limited to, the following origin, human, ovine, porcine, equine, bovine, rabbit and the like. <br>
The term"potency"in relation to FSH activity, refers to the ability of an FSH formulation or a mixed formulation, to elicit biological responses associated with FSH, such as ovarian weight gain in the Steelman-Pohley assay8, or follicular growth in a female patient. Follicular growth in a female patient can be evaluated by ultrasound, for example, in terms of the number of follicles having a mean diameter of at or about 16 mm on day 8 of stimulation. Biological activity is evaluated with respect to an accepted standard for FSH. <br>
The term"potency"in relation to LH activity, refers to the ability of an LH formulation or a mixed formulation, to elicit biological responses associated with LH, such as seminal vesicle weight gain method. ° Biological activity of LH is evaluated with respect to an accepted standard for LH. <br>
The term"aqueous diluent"refers to a liquid solvent that contains water. Aqueous solvent systems may be consist solely of water, or may consist of water plus one or more miscible solvents, and may contain dissolved solutes such as sugars, buffers, salts or other excipients. The more commonly used non-aqueous solvents are the short-chain organic alcohols, such as, methanol, ethanol, propanol, short-chain ketones, such as acetone, and poly alcohols, such as glycerol. <br>
An"isotonicity agent"is a compound that is physiologically tolerated and imparts a suitable tonicity to a formulation to prevent the net flow of water across cell membranes that are in contact with the formulation. Compounds such as glycerin, are commonly used for such purposes at known concentrations. Other suitable isotonicity agents include, but are not limited to, amino acids or proteins (e. g., glycine or albumin), salts (e. g. , sodium chloride), and sugars (e. g. , dextrose, sucrose and lactose). <br>
The term"bacteriostatic"or"bacteriostatic agent"refers to a compound or compositions added to a formulation to act as an anti-bacterial agent. A preserved FSH or FSH variant or FSH and LH containing formulation of the present invention preferably meets statutory or regulatory guidelines for preservative effectiveness to be a commercially viable multi-use product, preferably in humans. Examples of bacteriostatics include phenol, m-cresol, p-cresol, o-cresol, chlorocresol. benzyl alcohol, alkylparaben (methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl and the like), benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, sodium dehydroacetate and thimerosal. <br>
The term"buffer"or"physiologicaily-acceptable buffer'refers to solutions of compounds that are known to be safe for pharmaceutical or veterinary use in formulations and that have the effect of maintaining or controlling the pH of the formulation in the pH range desired for the formulation. Acceptable buffers for controlling pH at a moderately acidic pH to a moderately basic pH include, but are not limited to, such compounds as phosphate, acetate, citrate, arginine, TRIS, and histidine."TRIS"refers to 2-amino-2-hydroxymethyl-1, 3,-propanediol, and to any pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof. Preferable buffers are phosphate buffers with saline or an acceptable salt. <br>
The term"phosphate buffer"refers to solutions containing phosphoric acid or salts thereof, adjusted to a desired pH. Generally phosphate buffers are prepared from phosphoric acid, or a salt of phosphoric acid, including but not limited to sodium and potassium salts. Several salts of phosphoric acid are known in the art, such as sodium and potassium monobasic, dibasic, and tribasic salts of the acid. Salts of phosphoric acid are also known to occur as hydrates of the occurring salt. Phosphate buffers may cover a range of pHs, such as from about pH 4 to about pH 10, and preferred ranges from about pH 5 to about pH 9, and a most preferred range of at or about 6.0 to at or about 8.0, most preferably at or about pH 7.0. <br>
The term"vial"refers broadly to a reservoir suitable for retaining FSH in solid or liquid form in a contained sterile state. Examples of a vial as used herein include ampoules, cartridges, blister packages, or other such reservoir suitable for delivery of the FSH to the patient via syringe, pump (including osmotic), catheter, transdermal patch, pulmonary or transmucosal spray. Vials suitable for packaging products for parenteral, pulmonary, transmucosal, or transdermal administration are well known and recognized in the art. <br>
The term"stability"refers to the physical, chemical, and conformational stability of FSH and LH in the formulations of the present invention (including maintenance of biological potency). Instability of a protein formulation may be caused by chemical degradation or aggregation of the protein molecules to form higher order polymers, by dissociation of the heterodimers into monomers, deglycosylation, modification of glycosylation, oxidation (particularly of the a-subunit) or any other structural modification that reduces at least one biological activity of an FSH polypeptide included in the present invention. <br>
A"stable"solution or formulation, is one wherein the degree of degradation, modification, aggregation, loss of biological activity and the like, of proteins therein is acceptably controlled, and does not increase unacceptably with time. Preferably the formulation retains at least at or about 80% of the labeled FSH activity and at least at or about 80% of the labelled LH activity over a period of 6 months at a temperature of at or about 2-8°C, more preferably at or about 2-8°C, more preferably at or about 4- 5°C. FSH activity can be measured using the Steelman-Pohley ovarian weight gain bioassay5. LH activity can be measured using the seminal vesicle weight gain bioassay'°. <br>
The term"treating"refers to the administration, follow up, management and/or care of a patient for which FSH and/or LH administration is desirable for th e purpose of follicle or testicular stimulation or any other physiological response regulated by FSH and/or LH. Treating can thus include, but is not limited to, the administration of FSH and/or LH for the induction or improvement of sperm quality, stimulation of testosterone release in the male, or foliicular development or for ovulation induction in the female. <br>
The expression'multi-dose use"is intended to include the use of a single vial, ampoule or cartridge of an FSH formulation or a formulation of FSH and LH for more than one injection, for example 2,3, 4,5, 6 or more injections. The injections are preferably made over a period of at least at or about 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, etc. , preferably up to a period of at or about 12 days. The injections may be spaced in time, for example, by a period of 6,12, 24,48 or 72 hours. <br>
A"salt"of a protein is an acid or base addition salt. Such salts are preferably formed between any one or more of the charged groups in the protein and any one or more physiologically acceptable, non-toxic cations or anions. Organic and inorganic salts include, for example, those prepared from acids such as hydrochloric, sulphuric, sulfonic, tartaric, fumaric, hydrobromic, glycolic, citric, maleic, phosphoric, succinic, acetic, nitric, benzoic, ascorbic, p-toluenesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, naphthalenesulfonic, propionic, carbonic, and the like, or for example, ammonium, sodium, potassium, calcium, or magnesium. <br>

The inventors have further found that by formulating FSH and mixtures of FSH and LH with a surfactant selected from block copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, preferably Pluronic F77, Pluronic F87, Pluronic F88 and Pluronic F68, particularly preferably Pluronic F68 (BASF, Pluronic F68 is also known as Poloxamer 188) they obtain a stable formulation that avoids the problem of precipitation in the presence of a bacteriostatic agent, such as m-cresol and phenol. Precipitation, resulting in the formation of turbid or milky solutions occurs when TWEEN 20 is used with m-cresol or phenol. <br>
The Pluronic surfactants are block copolymers of ethylene oxide (EO) and propylene oxide (PO). The propylene oxide block (PO) is sandwiched between two ethylene oxide (EO) blocks. <br>
Pluronic surfactants are synthesised in a two-step process: 1. A hydrophobe of the desired molecular weight is created by the controlled addition of propylene oxide to the two hydroxyl groups of propylene glycol ; and 2. Ethylene oxide is added to sandwich the hydrophobe between hydrophilic groups. <br>

The follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) within the freeze-dried formulation is preferably present at a concentration (w/w) of at or about 0.1 to 10 pg/mg of the total formulation.

Due to greater batch-to-batch consistency and purity of recombinant FSH and LH, the hormones can be readily identified and quantified using techniques such as isoelectric focussing (IEF). The ease with which recombinant FSH and LH can be identified and quantified permits the filling of vials by mass of hormone (fill-by-mass) rather than filling by bioassay. <br>

Example 1 Comparative formulations Materials <br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
 The following study evaluated the following parameters for a large number of formulations: # Compatibility of surfactant and bacteriostatic # Oxidation of alpha-subunit The formulations were multi-dose formulations and contained either TWEEN 20 or Pluronic F68 as well as a bacteriostati c agent. The following three bacteriostatic agents were evaluated: # Benzyl alcohol 0.9% m-Cresol 0. 3% Phenol 0. 5% TWEEN 20 and Pluronic F68 were used at the following range of concentrations: # TWEEN 20: range from 10 to 100 pg/g Pluronic F68 : range from 10 to 100 pg/g Solutions prepared are listed in Table 1. <br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
FSH was added to the formulations on the basis of its biopotency instead of protein content. <br>
From visual examination of the formulations, it was determined that TWEEN 20 cannot be used with m-cresol and phenol because FSH formulations containing TWEEN 20 and m-cresol or TWEEN 20 and phenol presented a white opalescent suspension. In contrast, FSH formulations containing Pluronic F68 did not exhibit this problem with m-creso) and phenol. The use of Pluronic F68 permits the use of phenol and m-cresol. <br>
Combination of FSH and Pluronic F68 with antioxidants The following antioxidants were evaluated for their ability to inhi bit oxidation of the a-subunit in the presence of Pluronic F68: Methionine: range from 10 to 100 pg/g Ascorbic Acid: range from 10 to 100 pg/g Sucrose and Mannitol were used as tonicity agents and TWEEN 20 or Pluronic were added at the concentration of 100 pg/g. <br>
The formulations prepared are listed in Table 2. <br>

FSH was added to the formulations on the basis of its biopotency instead of protein content. <br>
20 g of each formulation was prepared into Falcon polypropylene tubes and filtered through a 3cm2 0.22 lm Millex-GV Syringe Driven filter unit Durapore, then analysed for a value at t=0. The solutions were then stored at 40°C and tested according the following scheme: <br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Test performed Reverse phase HPLC reveals that in formulations containing FSH, Pluronic F68, m- cresol and methionine (at 10 and 100 pg/ml), oxidation of the a-subunit of FSH when the formulation is stored at 40°C, is greatly reduced, versus a formulation containing no methionine, as can be seen in Figure 1. Based on the average of two experiments, In the Formulation containing no methionine, the percent of oxidised a-subunit is 2.3 at T=O, 4.0 at T= 1 week, and 7.1 at T= 2 weeks. In the formulation containing 10 ug/ml methionine, the percent of oxidised α-subunit is 2.0 at T=0, 3.2 at T= 1 week, and 3.8 at T= 2 weeks. In the formulation containing 100 pg/ml methionine, the percent of oxidised a-subunit is 1.8 at T=0, 1. 7 at T= 1 week, and 1.3 at T= 2 weeks. <br>
