				<td>TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROCESS AND APPARATUS FOR RECOVERING COMPONENTS OF SEALED TYPE BATTERY<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process and apparatus for recovering the constituent components of a sealed type battery. More particularly, the present invention relates to a process and apparatus for safely and efficiently opening a sealed type battery to recover the constituent components thereof. Related Background Art<br>
In recent years, global warming from the so-called greenhouse effect has been predicted due to increased level of atmospheric CO^. To prevent this warming phenomenon from further developing, there is a tendency to prohibit the construction of new steam-power generation plants which exhaust a large quantity of CO^.<br>
Under these circumstances, proposals have been made to institute load leveling in order to effectively utilize power. Load leveling involves the installation of rechargeable batteries at general locations to serve a storage for surplus power unused in the night, known as<br><br>
dump power. The power thus stored is available in the day time when the power demand is increased, leveling the load requirements in terms of power generation.<br>
Separately, there is an increased societal demand for developing a high performance rechargeable battery with a high energy density for an electric vehicle which would not exhaust air polluting substances. There is further increased societal demand for developing a miniature, lightweight, high performance rechargeable battery usable as a power source for potable instruments such as small personal computers, word processors, video cameras, and pocket telephones.<br>
For the batteries including rechargeable batteries for such uses as above mentioned, there have been developed various storage batteries including rechargeable batteries having an enclosed (or sealed) configuration. Specific examples of such storage battery are lead-acid battery, nickel-cadmium battery, nickel-metal hydide battery having a high energy density, nickel-zinc battery, rechargeable lithium battery and like others. In order for these storage batteries to have a long battery lifetime or/and to be ensured in terms of safety, there is usually employed a sealing manner with the use of a battery housing. In addition, in order to ensure further safety, these batteries are mostly provided with a safety vent. This<br><br>
safety vent serves to ensure the safety when the inside pressure of the battery housing is incidentally increased, by communicating the inside of the battery housing to the atmosphere outside the battery housing to thereby reduce the increased inside pressure of the battery housing.<br>
Now, the nickel-metal hydide battery is a rechargeable battery in which electrochemical oxidation-reduction reaction of hydrogen ion is used. The nickel-metal hydride battery typically comprises an anode comprising an anode active material layer comprised of a hydrogen storage (absorbing) alloy, a cathode comprising a cathode active material layer comprised of nickel hydroxide (specifically, nickelous hydroxide), and an electrolyte solution. In this battery, when charging is operated, the hydrogen ion of the electrolyte solution at the side of the anode is reduced into hydrogen, followed by entering into the anode active material layer of the anode where the hydrogen is retained therein, and when discharging is operated, the hydrogen retained in the anode active material layer is oxidized into hydrogen ion, followed by incorporating into the electrolyte solution. For the cathode active material layer of the cathode, the constituent nickel oxyhydroxide is oxidized into a nickel oxide when charging is operated, and when discharging is operated, the nickel oxyhydroxide is reduced into the<br><br>
original nickel hydroxide. For the nickel-metal hydride battery, in order for the hydrogen storage alloy of the anode to efficiently retain hydrogen upon operating the charging and also in order to attain a high battery capacity, the components of the battery are usually sealed in a battery housing.<br>
There are known various lithium batteries in which electrochemical oxidation-reduction reaction of lithium ion is used. In these lithium batteries, because lithium is readily reacted with moisture in the atmosphere to cause a decrease in the battery capacity, there are used an electrolyte solution in which a nonaqueous organic or inorganic solvent which is substantially free of moisture is used, and a battery housing capable of sufficiently sealing their components. And the fabrication of these batteries is conducted in an atmosphere which is sufficiently free of moisture.<br>
Specific examples of these lithium batteries, there can be illustrated commercially available primary lithium batteries, commercially available so-called lithium ion batteries, and rechargeable lithium metal batteries (which have been put into the research or which are under development). In the primary lithium battery and rechargeable lithium metal batteries, their anodes have an anode active material layer comprising a lithium metal.<br><br>
In the lithium ion battery, as the anode active material layer, there is used a carbonous material such as graphite capable of intercalating lithium ion into the network planes of the carbonous material when charging is operated, and as the cathode, there is used a transition metal compound capable of intercalating lithium ion into the transition metal compound when discharging is operated.<br>
Incidentally, the foregoing storage batteries including rechargeable batteries enclosed by such battery housing as above described have been currently using in various potable instruments. For these sealed type batteries, to recover them and to recycle their components will be essential not only in terms of development of new potable instruments but also in viewpoints that they are expected to be further developed in the future so that they can be used in electric vehicles, load conditioners, power storage, or the like, and also in a viewpoint that the consumption of the batteries is expected to greatly increase in the future.<br>
However, in order to recover the components of these sealed type batteries, it is necessary to firstly open their battery housings. In this case, problems are liable to entail in that upon the opening, the cathode is often contacted with the anode to cause internal shorts between the two electrodes, where the residual electric capacity is<br><br>
suddenly consumed within a short period of time to cause heat generation, resulting in deteriorating the battery components such that they cannot be recycled. Because of this, there cannot be attained a desirable recovery for the battery components.<br>
In this respect, for the sealed type batteries, there is an increased demand for developing a recovering process including a opening process which enables to efficiently recover their components without being damaged or deteriorated even in the case where their cathode and anode are contacted with each other upon the opening.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been accomplished in view of the foregoing situation in the prior art.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a recovering process which enables to safely and efficiently recover the components of a sealed type battery without the components being damaged or deteriorated.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION AND PREFERRED<br>
EMBODIMENTS<br>
As previously described, the present invention includes a recovering process for recovering the components of a sealed type battery sealed, comprising at least a step of decreasing the ionic conductivity between the cathode and anode and a step of opening the battery housing; and a recovering apparatus for recovering the components of a sealed type battery, comprising at least a means for decreasing the ionic conductivity between the cathode and anode and a means for opening the battery housing.<br>
A principal feature of the recovering process is that prior to opening the sealed type battery, to decrease the ionic conductivity between the cathode and anode is conducted. Similarly, a principal feature of the recovering apparatus according to the present invention is to have a specific means for decreasing the ionic conductivity between the cathode and anode prior to opening the enclosed type battery.<br>
In the present invention, by extracting the electrolyte solution or the solvent of the electrolyte solution outside the sealed type battery to decrease the ionic conductivity between the cathode and anode prior to opening the battery housing of the sealed type battery.<br><br>
even in the case where internal shorts should be occurred between the cathode and anode when the battery housing is opened or the battery components are taken out from the inside of the battery housing as will be described later, the occurrence of sudden energy release and combustion due to the internal shorts is effectively prevented. As a result, it is possible to safely recover the battery components without being deteriorated or destroyed. By this, there can be realized safe recovery of the components of the sealed type battery at a high recovery rate.<br>
The recovering process and apparatus according to the present invention are effective in recovering the components of any sealed type batteries including sealed type primary and secondary (rechargeable) batteries, notwithstanding the kind of a battery enclosed therein.<br>
Specific examples of such sealed type battery for which the recovering process and the recovering apparatus according to the present invention are particularly effective in recovering the battery components are lithium batteries including lithium ion rechargeable batteries (in which an anode comprising a carbonous material capable of intercalating lithium ion is used) in which electrochemical oxidation-reduction reaction of lithium ion is used; nickel-metal hydride rechargeable batteries having an anode comprising a hydrogen storage alloy and in which<br><br>
electrochemical oxidation-reduction reaction of hydrogen ion is used; and nickel-cadmium batteries.<br>
Herein, for the lithium batteries, a variety of enclosed type primary lithium batteries having an anode comprising a lithium metal have been frequently using in potable instruments such as cameras, wristwatches and the like. And the consumption of these primary lithium batteries are expected to further increase in the future. In addition, the consumption of rechargeable lithium batteries is expected to increase in the future. Under this circumstance, the waste disposal of these lithium batteries will be possibly a serious problem in the future as well as in the case of other batteries. In this respect, it is an urgent necessity of recovering and recycling their components such as anodes, cathodes, electrolytes, separators, and housings.<br>
Now, in order to separately recover the components of an used sealed type lithium battery, the battery housing is required to be opened while preventing external moisture invasion, which will be a cause of damaging or deteriorating the battery characteristics.<br>
As a most simple manner for unsealing the battery housing of an enclosed type battery, there is considered a mechanically cutting manner. However, when this manner is employed particularly in the case of an enclosed type<br><br>
lithium battery, problems are liable to entail in that as the energy per unit volume and unit weight is extremely high and a combustible material such as organic solvent is contained, a spark is generated or internal shorts are occurred between the anode and cathode upon mechanically cutting the battery housing, where the components are damaged or deteriorated. Besides, other problems are liable to entail such that will be described in the following. When the battery components situated inside the battery housing are taken out after the battery housing has been unsealed, as the anode and cathode are closed to each other, they tend to readily suffer from internal shorts where the internal shorts should be occurred between them, the residual battery energy is released at a stroke to cause sudden heat generation.<br>
Therefore, particularly for a sealed type lithium battery, there is demand for developing a desirable recovering process and a desirable recovering apparatus capable of recovering the battery components without being damaged or deteriorated for dealing with an increase in the consumption thereof.<br>
The present invention desirably meets this demand.<br>
In the recovering process for recovering the components of a sealed type battery which comprises an electrolyte solution as the electrolyte, the step of<br><br>
decreasing the ionic conductivity between the cathode and anode is desired to be conducted by a manner of extracting the electrolyte solution or the solvent thereof present within the battery housing outside the battery housing. In the case where the enclosed battery provided with a safety vent, to extract the electrolyte solution or the solvent thereof outside the battery housing is desired to be conducted while taking advantage of the safety vent in view of working efficiency, for instance, in a manner wherein through the safety vent, the pressure of the atmosphere outside the battery housing is decreased to increase the inside pressure of the battery housing whereby causing a differential pressure between the outside and the inside of the battery housing, and by this, the safety vent is actuated to extract the electrolyte solution or the solvent thereof outside the battery housing. The electrolyte solution or the solvent thereof thus extracted outside the battery housing can be recycled.<br>
In the recovering process for recovering the components of a sealed type battery, the step of decreasing the ionic conductivity between the cathode and anode is desired to be conducted at least through a manner of cooling the enclosed type battery. In the case where this manner is employed, when a solvent is used in the electrolyte solution of the sealed type battery, it is<br><br>
desired to cool the sealed type battery to a temperature which is lower than the freezing point of the solvent. In the case where a solid polymer electrolyte solidified by using a polymer is used in the sealed type battery, it is desired to cool the sealed type battery to a temperature which is lower than the glass transition temperature of the constituent polymer of the solid polymer electrolyte.<br>
The above manner of cooling the sealed battery can be conducted by a cooling manner of cooling an object using an incombustible compressed gas comprising one or more gases selected from the group consisting of N2 gas, Ar gas. He gas, CO^ gas and fluorocarbon gas.<br>
Besides this, it is possible for the above manner of cooling the sealed type battery to be conducted by a manner of cooling the sealed type battery by immersing it in a cooling agent or a liquefied gas. The cooling agent can include, for example, a mixture comprising dryice and methanol and a mixture comprising dryice and ethanol. The liquefied gas can include, for example, liquid nitrogen and the like.<br>
Alternatively, it is possible for the above manner of cooling the sealed type battery to be conducted by a manner of immersing the sealed type battery in water, followed by freezing the enclosed type battery together with the water. In this case, the sealed type battery is desired to be<br><br>
opened in a state in that the sealed type battery is sealed in the ice.<br>
In the recovering process for recovering the components of a sealed type battery, it is desired for the step of opening the battery housing after the ionic conductivity between the cathode and anode has been decreased to be conducted in an incombustible atmosphere. In this case, there are provided advantages in that the battery components are prevented from being oxidized or combusted and they can be safely recovered while desirably preventing them from being damaged or deteriorated at a high recovery. The above incombustible atmosphere may be an atmosphere composed of one or more gases selected from the group consisting of N2 gas, Ar gas. He gas, CO2 gas, fluorocarbon gas, and steam. In the case where the foregoing cooling manner using the incombustible compressed gas is employed in the step of decreasing the ionic conductivity between the cathode and anode, the gas used to constitute the atmosphere for opening the battery housing is desired to the same as the gas used as the compressed gas.<br>
As the manner of opening the battery housing, there can be illustrated a cutting process using a high pressure water, a cutting process using a energy beam, a mechanically cutting process, and a cutting process by way<br><br>
of spraying a high pressure water containing an abrasive mixed therein to an object through a jet nozzle.<br>
In the present invention, by subjecting the battery to discharging prior to opening the housing of the sealed type battery, preferably at a stage before decreasing the ionic conductivity between the cathode and anode, to open the sealed type battery can be more safely conducted. In this case, the chemical composition of the constituent material for each of the cathode and anode active material layers becomes uniform without depending upon the residual battery capacity before the discharging, where the cathode material and the anode material each having a satisfactory uniformity in terms of the chemical composition can be recovered. Further in this case, by means of the discharging, it is possible to withdraw the energy remained in the enclosed battery.<br>
Further in the present invention, by sorting the sealed batteries depending on the shape or the type before their housings are unsealed, their components can be efficiently recovered.<br>
As previously described, the recovering apparatus according to the present invention for recovering the components of a sealed type battery sealed by a battery housing, comprises at least a means for decreasing the ionic conductivity between the cathode and anode and a<br><br>
means for opening the battery housing.<br>
The means for decreasing the ionic conductivity between the cathode and anode is desired to comprise at least a means for extracting the electrolyte solution or the solvent thereof present inside the battery housing outside the battery housing. In the case where the sealed type battery is provided with a safety vent, this means is desired to have a function of actuating the safety vent, for instance, by decreasing the pressure of the atmosphere outside battery housing to increase the inside pressure of the battery housing across the safety vent whereby causing a differential pressure between the outside and the inside of the battery housing and a means for extracting the electrolyte solution or the solvent thereof present inside the battery housing outside the battery housing through the safety vent. The means for extracting the electrolyte solution or the solvent thereof present inside the battery housing outside the battery housing is desired to comprise a vessel provided with at least an exhaust means. It is desired for the vessel in this case to be provided with a member which can be close-contacted with or joined to the battery housing"s exterior wall face including a portion of the battery capping in the neighborhood of the safety vent and an opening (or a passage) for transferring the electrolyte solution or the solvent thereof (which is<br><br>
extracted from the battery) into the vessel.<br>
In the above described vessel, a port capable of introducing air, nitrogen gas (N2) or inert gas thereinto may be provided through a valve.<br>
In the recovering apparatus according to the present invention, for instance, by establishing a closed or sealed space by a part of the battery housing"s exterior face including the battery capping or the entire thereof (including the portion through which the electrolyte solution or the solvent thereof is extracted) and the above described vessel and decreasing the inner pressure of the sealed space than the inner pressure of the enclosed battery while maintaining the safety vent portion in the sealed space, the electrolyte solution or the solvent present inside the battery housing can be desirably recovered into the vessel through the safety vent.<br>
In the recovering apparatus according to the present invention, the above closed (sealed) space is desired to be established by connecting the above vessel provided with the exhaust means to a region including a portion (e.g., the safety vent) through which the electrolyte solution or the solvent thereof present inside the battery housing is extracted after the inner pressure of the above vessel has been decreased than the atmospheric pressure by means of the exhaust means provided at the vessel.<br><br>
In the recovering apparatus according to the present Invention, it is possible that the above closed space is first established by the above and thereafter, the inner pressure of the sealed space is lowered than the inner pressure of the sealed battery by means of the above exhaust means provided at the vessel.<br>
In the recovering apparatus according to the present invention, the foregoing means for decreasing the ionic conductivity between the cathode and anode is desired to comprise a cooling means for cooling the sealed type battery.<br>
To cool the sealed type battery by means of the cooling means is desired to be conducted by using an incombustible compressed gas comprising one or more gases selected from the group consisting of N^  gas, Ar gas. He gas, CO^ gas and fluorocarbon gas in the cooling means.<br>
Alternatively, to cool the enclosed battery by means of the cooling means may be conducted by using a cooling agent or a liquefied gas in the cooling means. The cooling agent can include, for example, a mixture comprising dryice and methanol and a mixture comprising dryice and ethanol. The liquefied gas can include, for example, liquid nitrogen and the like.<br>
Further, it is possible that the sealed type battery is immersed in water, followed by freezing the sealed type<br><br>
battery together with the water. In this case, the sealed type battery is desired to be opened in a state in that the enclosed battery is sealed in the ice.<br>
In the recovering apparatus according to the present invention, as the means for unsealing the battery housing, there can be illustrated a cutting means using a high pressure water, a cutting means using a energy beam, a mechanically cutting means, and a cutting means using a high pressure water containing an abrasive mixed therein.<br>
To open the battery housing by any of these cutting means is desired to be conducted in an incombustible atmosphere. The incombustible atmosphere may be an atmosphere composed of one or more gases selected from the group consisting of N2 gas, Ar gas. He gas, CO^ gas, fluorocarbon gas, and steam.<br>
In the following, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described while referring to the drawings.<br>
FIG. 1 is a schematic flow diagram illustrating an example of the recovering process for recovering the components of a sealed type battery according to the present invention.<br>
Description will be made of an embodiment of the recovering process according to the present invention with reference to FIG. 1.<br><br>
In order to efficiently recover the components of a sealed type battery, used sealed type batteries (FIG. l(a-1)) collected for recovering their components are first sorted depending on the shape or the type (see, FIG. l(a-2)).<br>
Then, the sealed type battery thus sorted is subjected to decrease the ionic conductivity between the anode and cathode (see, FIG. l(a-3)). In this case, to decrease the ionic conductivity between the cathode and anode may be conducted by the foregoing manner of extracting the electrolyte solution or the solvent thereof present between the cathode and anode (in the case of using the electrolyte solution as the electrolyte in the battery) outside the battery housing through the safety bent or the like annexed to the battery housing. Alternatively, it may be conducted by the foregoing manner of cooling the battery to decrease the ionic conductivity between the cathode and anode.<br>
Thereafter, the battery housing is opened (see, FIG. l(a-4)), followed by taking out a body comprising the battery components present inside the battery housing (see, FIG. l(a-5)).<br>
The body thus taken out is washed (see, FIG. l(a-6). Then, the body is dissociated (separated) into individual battery components and the battery components thus<br><br>
dissociated are recovered (see, FIG. l(a-7)).<br>
FIG. 2 is a schematic flow diagram illustrating another example of the recovering process for recovering the components of a sealed type battery according to the present invention.<br>
Description will be made of another embodiment of the recovering process according to the present invention with reference to FIG. 2.<br>
In order to efficiently recover the components of each used sealed type battery, used sealed type batteries (FIG. 2(b-l)) collected for recovering their components are first sorted depending on the shape or the type (see, FIG. 2(b-2)).<br>
Then, the sealed type battery thus sorted is cooled to decrease the ionic conductivity between the anode and cathode whereby increasing the internal resistance (see, FIG. 2(b-3)).<br>
Thereafter, the battery housing of the sealed type battery thus cooled in the above step is opened in an incombustible atmosphere (see, FIG. 2(b-4)).<br>
Then, in the case where the battery in the sealed type battery is based on a lithium battery, an appropriate reacting agent is reacted with the active lithium present inside the battery housing to decrease the reactivity of the lithium (see, FIG. 2(b-5)).<br><br>
Successively, a body comprising the battery components present inside the battery housing is taken out (see, FIG. 2(b-6)).<br>
In the case where the electrolyte is in the liquid state, the body (comprising the battery components) thus taken out is washed with an appropriate organic solvent (see, FIG. 2(b-7)).<br>
Then, the body thus washed is dissociated into individual battery components and the battery components thus dissociated are recovered (see, FIG. 2(b-8)).<br>
If necessary, the residual electric capacity in the used sealed battery may be discharged after sorting the battery, where the steps of opening the battery housing, dissociating the battery into individual components and recovering the components may be conducted more safely. Specific examples of the manner for doing this, there can be mentioned a manner wherein the anode and cathode terminals of the battery are electrically connected to a capacitor to conduct discharging, and a manner wherein charging is conducted by connecting a resistance between the anode and cathode terminals of the battery. In any case, the charging is conducted until the electric capacity of the battery decreases suddenly.<br><br>

By this, the safety vent 102 is actuated (opened in other words), where the electrolyte solution or the solvent thereof contained in the battery 100 is extracted into the extraction pipe 103, followed by flowing into the storage tank 104. As a result, there is provided a<br><br>
situation in that no electrolyte solution is present between the cathode and anode (not shown) in the battery 100 and the ionic conductivity between the two electrodes is decreased.<br>

For the electrolyte solution or the solvent thereof extracted into the storage tank 104, a predetermined amount thereof is periodically drained by opening the drain valve 110 to the outside, followed by recovering. The electrolyte solution or the solvent thereof thus recovered may be recycled.<br>
For the sealed type battery from which the electrolyte solution or the solvent thereof has been extracted in the system shown in FIG. 3 or 4 as above described, its housing is opened by an appropriate unsealing manner in a state in that the ionic conductivity between the cathode and anode has been decreased, and the battery components are recovered.<br>
In the following, description will be made of an embodiment of the step of increasing the internal resistance of a sealed type battery by cooling the battery and an embodiment of the step of opening the housing of<br><br>
said cooled battery in the process for recovering the components of a sealed type battery by decreasing the ionic conductivity between the cathode and anode in the sealed type battery, while referring to an apparatus shown in FIG. 5 having a system capable of conducting these steps.<br>
FIG. 5 is a schematic conceptional view illustrating an example of an apparatus for cooling a sealed type battery and opening its battery housing as a part of the recovering apparatus according to the present invention for recovering the components of a sealed type battery.<br>
In the apparatus shown in FIG. 5, there is shown a case wherein a cooling apparatus capable of cooling a sealed type battery by using a compressed gas of an incombustible gas is used, and the same incombustible gas is used as an atmosphere under which to unseal the battery housing is conducted. The apparatus shown in FIG. 5 is provided with a means for recovering the gas having used for cooling the enclosed type battery, purifying the recovered gas and recycling the purified gas. In the apparatus shown in FIG. 5, in order to open the battery housing, a high pressure water or energy beam is used.<br>
The apparatus shown in FIG. 5 and its operation will be detailed.<br>
In FIG. 5, reference numeral 200 indicates an enclosed type battery, reference numeral 201 a cooling<br><br>
apparatus (a low temperature gas-blowing apparatus), reference numeral 202 a low temperature gas, reference numeral 203 an incombustible atmosphere, reference numeral 204 an unsealing apparatus for a battery housing, reference numeral 205 a high pressure water or energy beam, reference numeral 206 a partition wall, reference numeral 207 a fixing table for an enclosed type battery, reference numeral 208 a transportation mechanism for an enclosed type battery, reference numeral 209 a gas feed pipe for a compressed gas, reference numeral 210 a compressor, reference numeral 211 a removing device for removing impurities such as water, reference numeral 212 an incombustible gas-recovering device, reference numeral 213 a gas pipe for recovering an incombustible gas, reference numeral 214 a generation device for generating a high pressure water or energy beam, and reference numeral 215 a transfer pipe for a high pressure water or a transmission pipe for an energy beam.<br>
In the apparatus shown in FIG. 5, a used, sealed type battery 200 is fixed onto the fixing table 207 arranged on transportation mechanism 208 provided in the chamber demarcated by the partition wall 206, followed by sequentially transporting to the cooling step zone having the cooling apparatus 201 then to the unsealing step zone having the unsealing apparatus 204. The chamber space<br><br>
demarcated by the partition wall 206 including the zone of the cooling apparatus 201 and the zone of the unsealing apparatus is filled with an incombustible gas (the incombustible atmosphere 203).<br>
At the cooling apparatus 201, a low temperature gas 202 comprising a cooled incombustible gas is supplied to the enclosed type battery 200 to cool the electrolyte contained in the enclosed battery whereby decrease its ionic conductivity. As the low temperature gas 202 used herein, it is desired that the incombustible gas inside the partition wall 206 is recycled to use. Particularly in this respect, said incombustible gas is recovered by the incombustible gas-recovering device 212 through the gas conduit 213 connected to the chamber demarcated by the partition wall 206, purified by the impurities-removing device 211, compressed by the compressor 210, supplied to the cooling apparatus 201, followed by supplying to the enclosed type battery 200 as the low temperature gas 202 (the compressed gas).<br>
In the above cooling step for cooling the enclosed type battery, it is possible to cool the sealed type battery, for example, by using a cooling agent or liquefied gas. Alternatively, to cool the sealed type battery may be conducted by a manner wherein the sealed type battery is immersed in water, followed by freezing the water together<br><br>
with the battery such that the battery is sealed in the ice.<br>
Then, at the unsealing apparatus 204, for example, a high pressure water or energy beam 205 is effected to the sealed type battery 200 having been cooled in the above cooling step to open the battery housing. The high pressure water or energy beam used herein is produced by the generation device 214, followed by supplying to the unsealing apparatus 204 through the transfer pipe or transmission pipe 215.<br>
In the following, description will be made of detailed conditions in the cooling step for cooling an enclosed type battery, said cooling step including the foregoing cooling step using the apparatus shown in FIG. 5.<br>
Cooling Temperature<br>
Description will be made of the cooling temperature to which an enclosed type battery is cooled in order to decrease the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte.<br>
For instance, when the sealed type battery is a sealed type lithium battery in which an electrolyte solution comprising an electrolyte and an organic solvent is used as the electrolyte, in order to decrease the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte, the lithium battery is desired to be cooled to a temperature which is lower than the freesing temperature of the organic solvent of the<br><br>
electrolyte solution.<br>
When the electrolyte of the lithium battery comprises a polymer solid electrolyte solidified by using a polymer, in order to decrease the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte, the lithium battery is desired to be cooled to a temperature which is lower than the glass transition temperature of the polymer of the polymer solid electrolyte.<br>
Specifically, the range of the cooling temperature is preferably 0 °C or less, more preferably -20 °C or less.<br>
In the case where the sealed type battery is other sealed type battery such as sealed type metal hydride battery, sealed type nickel-cadmium battery, sealed type lead-acid battery, or the like, the cooling temperature for these batteries is desired to be in the above described temperature range.<br>
Cooling Means<br>
Description will be made of the cooling means for cooling a sealed type batter in order to decrease the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte.<br>
To cool a sealed type battery in order to decrease the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte may be conducted by a cooling manner with the use of a compressed gas comprising an incombustible gas (by using an appropriate cooling apparatus such as the cooling apparatus 201 shown<br><br>
in FIG. 5), or other cooling manner with the use of a liquefied gas or a cooling agent.<br>
The cooling manner with the use of a compressed gas comprising an incombustible gas may be conducted also by-using a cooling apparatus as shown in FIG. 6. The cooling apparatus shown in FIG. 6 is a tube-like shaped cooling apparatus comprising a compressed gas supply port 705 through which a compressed gas 704 is supplied, a hot gas exhaust port 708 including a pressure regulator 706, a cooling gas outlet 702, and a vortex generator zone 703 to generate a vortex flow 709. Reference numeral 701 indicates a direction for a cooling gas to be spouted, and reference numeral 707 a hot gas to be exhausted.<br>
In the cooling apparatus shown in FIG. 6, by flowing a compressed gas 704 into the inside of the apparatus through the gas supply port 705, a cooling gas is spouted in the direction 701 through the cooling gas outlet 702. In<br>
the case where a gas having a temperature of about 16 "C is<br>
2<br>
supplied at a gas pressure of 3 to 7 Kg/cm through the gas<br>
supply port 705, there is obtained a cold gas having a temperature of about -10 to about -50 °C. The compressed gas used in this apparatus may comprise an incombustible gas comprising one or more gases selected from the group consisting of N- gas, Ar gas. He gas, CO2 gas, and fluorocarbon gas.<br><br>
By this, particularly in the case where the cooling step and the opening step for the sealed type battery in an continuous atmosphere (which will be described later), even when internal shorts should be incidentally occurred between the node and cathode upon opening the battery housing by way of a cutting manner, the generation of a spark can be desirably prevented. Further, in the case of an enclosed type battery having a battery housing capable of being opened by way of disassembling without conducting cutting operation or the like, the generation of a spark due to internal shorts between the anode and cathode can be desirably prevented at the time when the components including the electrodes are taken out. Because of this, the recovery operation of the battery components can be safely conducted.<br>
In the case where the cooling step is conducted using a liquefied gas, there can be employed a cooling manner wherein the entire of an sealed type battery to be opened is directly immersed in an appropriate liquefied gas such as liquid nitrogen, liquid helium or the like or a cooling manner wherein a gasified low temperature gas of a liquefied gas is sprayed onto the battery housing of the sealed type battery to be unsealed.<br>
In the case where the cooling step is conducted using a cooling agent, the cooling agent can include dryice-<br><br>
methanol, dryice-ethanol, and ice.<br>
As previously described, it is possible that a sealed type battery is immersed in water, the water is frozen together with the battery, followed by opening the battery housing in a state in the battery is sealed in the ice.<br>
Battery Opening<br>
Description will be made of particulars in the opening step for opening the housing of a sealed type battery in which the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte has been decreased by means of the apparatus shown in FIG. 3 or 4 and in the opening step in the apparatus shown in FIG. 5.<br>
The atmosphere in which to open the housing of a sealed type battery is conducted is desired to be comprised of an incombustible gas comprising one or more gases selected from the group consisting of N2 gas, Ar gas. He gas, C0« gas, steam, and fluorocarbon gas. In this case, even when internal shorts should be incidentally occurred between the anode and cathode upon opening the battery housing, the generation of a spark is desirably prevented and in addition, the battery components are desirably prevented from being damaged due to oxidation.<br>
In the case where the cooling step is conducted by spraying a low temperature gas to the sealed type battery as previously described, by using a gas of the same kind as<br><br>
the low temperature gas as the constituent of the atmosphere in which the unsealing step is conducted, there are provided advantages such that the operation including recovery and recycling of the gas can be readily conducted and the running cost is reasonable.<br>
Specific examples of the above fluorocarbon gas are tetrafluoromethane, hexafluoroethane, perfluoropropane, trifluoromethane, monobromotri fluoromethane, dichlorodifluoromethane, and chlorotrifluoromethane.<br>
Battery Unsealing Means<br>
As previously described, to open the battery housing of a sealed type batter may conducted an appropriate unsealing manner by way of cutting with the use of a high pressure water or an energy beam (for instance, the unsealing manner using the unsealing apparatus 204 shown in FIG. 5) or a mechanically cutting manner.<br>
The cutting with the use of a high pressure water may<br>
be conducted, for example, by a manner of spraying an<br>
2 extra-high pressure water of preferably 1000 Kg/cm or more<br>
2 or more preferably, 3000 Kg/cm or more onto the battery<br>
housing of an enclosed type battery in a jet-like state<br>
through a nozzle. In this case, the extra-high pressure<br>
water to be sprayed may contain an appropriate abrasive<br>
depending upon the kind of the constituent of the battery<br>
housing.<br><br>
The above energy beam can include laser beam, electron beam and the like.<br>
The above mechanically cutting manner may be conducted by using a cutting apparatus of cutting an object by rotating a disc-like shaped blade (having a hard and sharp edge) at a high speed or by way of shearing.<br>
Incidentally, in the case where the sealed type battery is cooled such that the battery is sealed in the ice as previously described, to open the housing of the battery is desired to be conducted while maintaining said sealed state.<br>
For the sealed type battery in which the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte has been decreased and whose housing has been opened as previously described, the inside of the resultant battery is subjected washing or the like, followed by subjecting to classification and separation, and at a final stage, the constituent components thereof are recovered.<br>
Decrease of Reactivity of Active Lithium and Recovery of Lithium Element<br>
In the case where the sealed type battery to be subjected to recover is a sealed type lithium battery, after the battery housing has been opened, by decreasing the reactivity of an active lithium contained in the lithium battery, the successive step for recovering the<br><br>
battery components can be safely conducted. To decrease the reactivity of the active lithium having a high reactivity may be conducted by a manner of reacting an appropriate reacting agent with the active lithium. From the reaction product comprising the reacting agent and lithium obtained in this case, the recovery of lithium element can be easily conducted.<br>
Specific examples of the reacting agent are water, alcohols, acids, carbon dioxide, and mixtures of two or more of these.<br>
Recovery of Electrolyte Solution<br>
In the case where the electrolyte solution of a sealed type battery is extracted by increasing the internal pressure of the enclosed type battery, for instance, in the manner previously described with reference to FIGs. 3 and 4, followed by opening the battery housing, the recovery of the electrolyte solution can be easily conducted.<br>
Now, to recover the electrolyte solution in the case where a sealed type battery is cooled and the battery housing is opened may be conducted, for example, in the following manner.<br>
In the case of a sealed type battery in which an aqueous electrolyte solution is used, after the battery housing is opened, the resultant unsealed battery is subjected to washing with deionized water, the resultant<br><br>
washed solution is filtrated, followed by vaporizing water, whereby the electrolyte can be recovered.<br>
In the case of a sealed type battery in which an electrolyte solution comprising an electrolyte dissolved in an organic solvent is used, after the battery housing is unsealed, the resultant unsealed battery is subjected to washing with an appropriate organic solvent, followed by subjecting to fractional distillation, whereby the electrolyte solution can be recovered. As the organic solvent in this case, when an organic solvent incapable of forming an azeotrope with water is used, there are provided advantages such that a cutting manner using a high pressure water can be employed in cutting the battery housing, and as the reacting agent in order to decrease the reactivity of the active lithium, readily obtainable water with a reasonable production cost can be used.<br>
Description will be made of the above organic solvent incapable of forming an azeotrope with water.<br>
As above described, in the case of an enclosed type lithium, by using an organic solvent incapable of forming an azeotrope with water in washing an unsealed lithium battery obtained as a result of having unsealed the sealed type lithium battery, even when inexpensive deionized water is used as the reacting agent to decrease the reactivity of the active lithium contained in the lithium battery, the<br><br>
washing organic solvent can be readily separated from the water by way of fractional distillation.<br>
Specific examples of the foregoing organic solvent incapable of forming an azeotrope with water are methanol, acetone, 1,2-propanediol, dimethyl sulfoxide, butyrolactone, ethylene carbonate, and propylene carbonate.<br>
In the following, description will be made of an enclosed type battery whose constituent components are recovered according to the present invention, while referring to the drawings.<br>

For the battery structure, it includes a single-layered type, a multi-layered type and a spiral-wound type. In the case of a spiral-wound cylindrical battery comprising a stacked body (comprising a separator interposed between an anode and a cathode) wounded in multiple about a predetermined axis, it has advantages in that the battery area can be increased as desired and a high electric current can be flown upon operating charging and discharging. In the case of a battery in either a prismatic form or sheet-like form, it has an advantage in that the space of an instrument for housing the battery can be effectively utilized.<br>

In FIG. 9, reference numeral 500 indicates an anode collector, reference numeral 504 indicates a cathode collector, reference numeral 511 an insulating plate, and reference numeral 514 a safety vent.<br>
Particularly, in the single-layer structure type flat battery shown in FIG. 8, a stacked body comprising the cathode 403 comprising the cathode active material and the the anode 401 comprising the anode active material layer<br><br>
stacked through at least the separator 407 having an electrolyte solution retained therein is housed in the cathode can 406 on the cathode side. The anode side of the stacked body in the cathode can 406 is sealed by the anode cap 405 as the anode terminal and the residual inside space of the cathode can 406 is packed by the gasket 410 (comprising an insulating material).<br>
In the spiral-wound cylindrical battery shown in FIG. 9, a stacked body wounded in multiple about a predetermined axis is housed in the cathode can 506  as the cathode terminal such that the side face and a given bottom face side of the stacked body are covered by the cathode can 506, said stacked body comprising at least the separator 507 having an electrolyte solution retained therein interposed between the cathode 508 containing the cathode active material layer 503 formed on the cathode collector 504 and the anode 502 containing the anode active material layer 501 formed on the anode collector 500. In the uncovered side of the cathode can 506, the anode cap as the anode terminal is installed. The residual inside space of the cathode can 506 is packed by the gasket 510 (comprising an insulating material). The stacked electrode body having the cylindrical structure is electrically isolated from the<br>
anode cap side through the insulating plate 511. The anode<br>
*<br>
502 is electrically connected to the anode cap 505 by means<br><br>
of the anode lead 512. Similarly, the cathode 508 is electrically connected to the cathode can 505 by means of the cathode lead 513. On the anode cap side, there is provided the safety vent 514 for adjusting the internal pressure of the battery. This safety vent can be utilized for extracting the electrolyte solution to the outside as previously described.<br>
The prismatic battery shown in FIG. 10 comprises a plurality of unit cells integrated in parallel connection through a collector in a battery housing 609 having a capping, wherein each unit cell comprises a separator 607 having an electrolyte solution retained therein interposed between an anode 601 comprising an anode active material and a cathode 603 comprising a cathode active material. The anode 601 is electrically connected to an anode terminal 605, and the cathode 603 is electrically connected to a cathode terminal 606.

In the case of the configuration shown in FIG. 9, the cathode can 506 and the anode cap 505 serve respectively as a battery housing which functions also as a terminal. The constituent of such battery housing functioning also as the terminal may be stainless steel, titanium clad stainless steel, copper clad stainless steel, or nickel-plated steel.<br>
In the configurations shown in FIGs. 8 and 9, since the cathode can (406, 506) and the anode cap (405, 505) function respectively also as a battery housing, they are<br><br>
desired to be constituted by stainless steel.<br>
As in the case of such configuration as shown in FIG. 10, when neither the cathode can nor the anode can functions also as a battery housing, the constituent of the battery housing can include metals such as zinc, plastics such as polypropylene, and composites of a metal or glass fiber with plastic.<br>
For the enclosed type battery whose constituent components are recovered in the present invention, it is desired to be provided with an appropriate safety vent as in the case of the configuration shown in FIG. 9 (wherein the safety vent 514 is provided) or FIG. 10 (wherein the safety vents 614 are provided) in order to ensure the safety when the internal pressure of the battery is incidentally increased, by communicating the inside of the battery with the outside to thereby reduce the increased internal pressure of the battery.

The enclosed type battery in which an aqueous electrolyte solution is used and whose constituent components are recovered in the present invention includes lead-acid battery, nickel-cadmium battery, nickel-metal hydride battery, and nickel-zinc battery.<br>
The anode in these batteries comprises an anode active material comprising lead, cadmium, hydrogen-absorbing alloy or zinc, and an anode collector.<br>
The enclosed type battery whose constituent components are recovered in the present invention also includes various lithium batteries. The anode in these lithium batteries comprises a principal constituent which retains lithium therein at a stage before operating discharging, and an anode collector.<br>
Specific examples of such principal constituent are lithium metals, carbonous materials in which lithium is intercalated, transition metal oxides, and lithium alloys.<br>
The anode collector serves to supply an electric current so that it can be efficiently consumed for the electrode reaction upon operating charging and discharging or to collect an electric current generated.<br>
The anode collector may be constituted by an appropriate material which is highly electrically conductive and inactive to the battery reaction.<br><br>
Specific examples of such material are metals such as Ni, Ti, Cu, Al, Pt, Pd, Au, and Zn, alloys of these metals such as stainless steel, and composite metals of tow or more said metals.<br>
The anode collector may be shaped in a plate-like form, foil-like form, mesh form, porous form-like sponge, punching metal form, or expanded metal form.<br>
CATHOODE<br>
The cathode in the enclosed type battery whose constituent components are recovered in the present invention generally comprises a cathode collector, a cathode active material, an electrically conductive auxiliary, and a binding agent.<br>
The cathode is usually formed by disposing a mixture of a cathode active material, an electrically conductive auxiliary and a binding agent on a member capable of serving as a cathode collector.<br>
The electrically conductive auxiliary can include graphite, carbon blacks such as ketjen black and acetylene black, and metal fine powders of nickel or the like.<br>
As the binding agent in the case of using a nonaqueous series electrolyte solution, there can be illustrated polyolefines such as polyethylene, polypropylene, and the like; and fluororesins such as polyvinylidene fluoride, tetrafluoroethylene polymer, and<br><br>
the like.<br>
As the binding agent in the case of using an aqueous series electrolyte solution, there can be illustrated celluloses, polivinyl alcohol, and polyvinyl chloride, in addition those illustrate in the case of using the nonaqueous series electrolyte solution.<br>
As the cathode active material in the enclosed type battery in which an aqueous series electrolyte solution is used and whose constituent components are recovered in the present invention such as lead-acid battery, nickel-cadmium battery, nickel-metal hydride battery, or nickel-zinc battery, there is used lead oxide, nickel (III) oxyhydroxide or nickel hydroxide.<br>
The enclosed type battery whose constituent components are recovered in the present invention includes also various lithium batteries. As the cathode active material in these lithium batteries, there is usually used a compound selected from transition metal oxides, transition metal sulfides, lithium-transition metal oxides, and lithium-transition metal sulfides. The metals of these transition metal oxides and transition metal sulfides can include metals partially having a d-shell or f-shell. Specific examples of such metal are Sc, Y, lanthanoids, actinoids, Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Mn, Tc, Re, Fe, Ru, Os, Co, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag and Au. Of<br><br>
these, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni and Cu are particularly appropriate.<br>
The cathode collector in the enclosed type battery whose constituent components are recovered in the present invention serves to supply an electric current so that it can be efficiently consumed for the electrode reaction upon conducting the charging and discharging or to collect an electric current generated. The cathode collector is therefore desired to be constituted by a material which has a high electrical conductivity and is inactive to the battery reaction.<br>
The material by which the cathode collector is constituted can include Ni, Ti, Cu, Al, Pt, Pb, Au, Zn, alloys of these metals such as stainless steel, and composite metals of two or more of said metals.<br>
The cathode collector may be shaped in a plate-like form, foil-like form, mesh form, porous form-like sponge, punching metal form, or expanded metal form.<br>
Herein, the term "active material" in the foregoing anode or cathode active material means a material which is involved in the repetition of electrochemical reversible reaction of charging and discharging in the battery. Said active material can include, in addition to said material which is involved in the above reaction by itself, other material capable of being involved in the above reaction.<br><br>
SEPARATOR<br>
The separator in the enclosed type battery whose constituent components are recovered in the present invention is disposed between the anode and the canthode, and it serves to prevent the anode and the cathode from suffering from internal-shorts. In addition, the separator also serves to retain the electrolyte solution.<br>
The separator is required to have a porous structure capable of allowing ions involved in the charge and discharge reaction in the battery to pass therethrough and it is also required to be insoluble into and stable to the electrolyte solution.<br>
The separator is usually constituted by a nonwoven fabric or a memberane having a micropore structure made of glass, polyolefin such as polypropylene or polyethylene, fluororesin, or polyamide. Alternatively, the separator may be constituted by a metal oxide film or a resin film combined with a metal oxide respectively having a number of micropores.<br>
ELECTROLYTE<br>
For the electrolyte used in the enclosed type battery whose constituent components are recovered in the present invention, there can be used an appropriate electrolyte as it is, a solution of said electrolyte dissolved in a<br><br>
solvent, or a material of said solution having immobilized using a geling agent.<br>
However, an electrolyte solution obtained by dissolving an appropriate electrolyte in an solvent is usually used in a way that said electrolyte solution is retained on the separator.<br>
The higher the electrical conductivity of the electrolyte, the better. Particularly, it is desired to use<br>
such an electrolyte that the electrical conductivity at 25<br>
_3 "C is preferably 1 x 10  S/cm or more or more preferably,<br>
-3 5 X 10  S/cm or more.<br>
In the case of a lead-acid battery, there is used an aqueous solution of sulfuric acid as the electrolyte.<br>
As the electrolyte in the case of a nickel-cadmium battery, nickel-metal hydride battery, or nickel-zinc battery, there is used an aqueous solution of an alkali. Particularly, there is usually used an aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide added with lithium hydroxided.<br>
As the electrolyte in the case of a lithium battery, there is usually used a given electrolyte dissolved in a given solvent.<br>
The electrolyte can include inorganic acids such as<br><br><br>
said salts.<br>
Besides these, salts of the above described Lewis acids ions with cations such as sodium ion, potassium ion, tetraalkylammonium ion, or the like are also usable.<br>
In any case, it is desired that the above salts are used after they are subjected to dehydration or deoxygenation, for example, by way of heat treatment under reduced pressure.<br>
The solvent in which the electrolyte is dissolved can include acetonitrile, benzonitrile, propylene carbonate, ethylene carbonate, dimethyl carbonate, diethyl carbonate, dimethylformamide, tetrahydrofuran, nitrobenzene, dichloroethane, diethoxyethane, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, chlorobenzene, Y-butyrolactone, dioxolan, sulfolan, nitrometane, dimethyl sulfide, dimethyl sulfoxide, methyl formate, 3-methyl-2-oxdazolydinone,<br>
2-methyltetrahydrofuran, 3-propylsydonone, sulfur dioxide, phosphonyl chloride, thionyl chloride, sulfuly chloride, and mixtures of two or more of these.<br>
As for these solvents, it is desired for them to be subjected to dehydration using activated alumina, molecular sieve, phosphorous pentaoxide, or calcium chloride, prior to their use. Alternatively, it is possible for them to be subjected to distillation in an atmosphere composed of inert gas in the presence of an alkali metal, wherein<br><br>
moisture and foreign matters are removed.<br>
In order to prevent leakage of the electrolyte solution, it is desired for the electrolyte solution to be gelated using an appropriate gelating agent.<br>
The gelating agent usable in this case can include polymers having a property such that it absorbs the solvent of the electrolyte solution to swell. Specific examples of such polymer are polyethylene oxide, polyvinyl alcohol, and polyacrylamide.<br>
In the following, the present invention will be described in more detail with reference to examples, which are only for illustrative purposes but not intended to restrict the scope of the present invention to these examples.<br>
Example 1<br>
In this example, for a prismatic nickel-metal hydride battery having the configuration shown in FIG. 10, based on the flow diagram shown in FIG. 1 and using the apparatus shown in FIG. 3 as a part of the previously described recovery system, the battery housing thereof was unsealed, followed by subjecting to washing, the resultant was dissociated into individual battery components, and these battery components were separately recovered.<br>
As the above battery, there was used a used prismatic nickel-metal hydride battery which comprises a cathode<br><br>
comprising a porous nickel material whose porous structure is filled by nickel hydroxide and nickel fine particles, an anode comprising a porous nickel material whose porous structure is filled by a powdery hydrogen storage alloy and a binder, an electrolyte solution comprising an aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide added with lithium hydroxide, and a battery housing made of polyopropylene. In the following, the step of decreasing the ionic conductivity in the battery, the unsealing step, and the recovering step will be sequentially explained with reference to FIGs. 1 and 3.<br>
1.	A capacitor was electrically connected to the terminal of the prismatic nickel-metal hydride battery, followed by subjecting the battery to discharging, whereby the residual electric capacity in the battery was transferred into the capacitor.<br>
2.	The battery thus discharged was set to the apparatus shown in FIG. 3 such that the safety vent-bearing face thereof was downward faced as shown in FIG. 3.<br>
3.	By actuating the vacuum pump of the vacuuming means 105 and opening the exhaust valve 109, the inside of the storage tank 104 was depressurized, followed by closing the exhaust valve 109. Then, the switching valve 108 was opened to actuate the safety vents of the battery. By this, the internal pressure of the battery was increased and as a<br><br>
result, the electrolyte solution in the battery was extracted into the extraction pipe 103, followed by flowing into the storage tank 104. Thereafter, the leak valve 113 was opened to introduce nitrogen gas into the apparatus, whereby the inside of the storage tank 104 was returned to atmospheric pressure. Then, the battery whose electrolyte solution having been extracted was detached from the apparatus.<br>
The electrolyte solution of the battery was recovered in the storage tank 104. The electrolyte solution thus recovered can be recycled by filtrating and refining it.<br>
4.	The battery whose electrolyte solution having been<br>
extracted obtained in the step 3 was set to a high pressure<br>
water cutting apparatus, wherein a high pressure water<br>

onto the battery to cut and unseal the battery housing of<br>
the battery.<br>
5.	From the unsealed battery obtained in the step 4,<br>
the cathode, anode and separator were taken out, washed,<br>
and dried, then followed by classification and recovery.<br>
In this case, because the electrolyte solution had been extracted from the battery in the step 3, even when the anode should have been contacted with the cathode upon taking out them, they could be safely recovered with no energy release.<br><br>
In the above, for the used prismatic nickel-metal hydride battery before the extraction of the electrolyte solution was conducted, the impedance between the positive and negative terminals was measured by means of an impedance meter. As a result, it was found to be 2 mi|2. And for the used prismatic battery whose electrolyte solution having been extracted, the impedance between the terminals was measured in the same manner. As a result, it was found to be more than 5 Mfi. This indicates that by the above cooling, the internal resistance of the battery seemingly has been desirably increased.<br>
