Pet food composition<br>
The present invention relates to pet food compositions which are useful for preventing or treating calculus, plaque, gingivitis and periodontal disease in pets, and for enhancing the antioxidative capacity in the whole organism of the animal.<br>
More particularly the present invention, in a first aspect, relates to pet food compositions, comprising trisodium acid-2-monophosphate or sodium-calcium L-ascorbic acid-2-monophosphate, or mixtures thereof.<br>
In a further aspect, the present invention relates to pet food compositions, comprising trisodium L-ascorbic acid-2-monophosphate or sodium-calcium L-ascorbic acid-2-monophosphate, or mixtures thereof and a polymer for improving the uptake and retention of trisodium L-ascorbic acid-2-monophosphate or sodium-calcium L-ascorbic acid-2-monophosphate in the oral cavity and on the teeth surface.<br>
In a particular aspect of the present invention, the L-ascorbic acid-2-monophosphate is trisodium L-ascorbic acid-2-monophosphate.<br>
The present invention further relates to any of the aforementioned compositions for use in the manufacture of a pet food, particularly for preventing or treating calculus, plaque, gingivitis and periodontal disease in pets, and for enhancing the antioxidative capacity in the whole organism.<br>
The term "pet" as used herein includes dogs, cats and rodents, e.g., chinchillas, guinea pigs, degus, mice, gerbils, hamsters, rats, ferrets and lagomorphes, e.g., rabbits. Animals of all ages are included, e.g. adults, animals of medium age and seniors. Of primary interest with respect to the present invention are dogs and cats.<br>
Plaque is a soft, gelatinous material composed of bacteria and their metabolic byproducts, oral debris, and salivary components. Mature plaque is not removed by normal actions of the tongue or by rising of the mouth. Rather, mechanical abrasion from chewing or tooth brushing is necessary for plaque removal.<br><br>
Left undisturbed, aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria proliferate as the plaque thickens and matures. Over time, salivary calcium salts are deposited on the plaque, producing calculus. Calculus is a hard deposit that provides a rough surface, promoting accumulation of more plaque and also contributing to tissue damage as it extends into the gingival sulcus. Gingivitis occurs when plaque and calculus form at the neck of the tooth, leading to inflammation and tissue damage. As the gingival sulcus enlarges into a periodontal pocket, the area provides an oxygen-depleted environment that allows proliferation of anaerobic bacteria. Periodontal disease becomes established when the periodontal ligament is exposed to plaque, bacteria, and bacterial byproducts.<br>
In some animals gingivitis persists without progressing into periodontitis. However, in most, untreated gingivitis eventually progresses to periodontal disease. Clinical signs of gingivitis and periodontal disease include oral malodor, gingival sensitivity and bleeding, tooth loss, and difficulty in eating.<br>
The presence and proliferation of certain species of anaerobic bacteria and the inflammatory responses of the host contribute to the progressive destruction of the periodontium. As the supporting connective tissues and adjacent bone are weakened, teeth become loose and may be lost. Periodontal disease itself causes discomfort and pain and, if left untreated, can lead to bacteremia.<br>
Odontoclasts resorptive lesions in cats also have been associated with gingival inflammation and, possibly, periodontal disease.<br>
Since the majority of periodontal pathogens are gram-negative bacteria which release endotoxins (lipopolysaccharides - LPS) dental diseases are a potential risk factor for systemic disease in pets resulting in a systemic bacteremia or LPS challenge.<br>
The importance of maintaining healthy periodontal tissues is of greater significance when considered that chronic periodontal disease my have a systemic as well as local effects. The most important factor that influences the development of gingivitis and periodontal disease in the dog and cat is the presence and persistence of undisturbed plaque on tooth surface. Once plaque has been deposited on the surface of the tooth, it may be reduced mechanically through abrasion provided by diet, chewing on supplemental chew toys or foods. The use of antimicrobial agents like chlorhexidine digluconate in conjunction with brushing, and the use of a chemical mouthwash is not effective in removing the hardened calculus that forms when plaque is allowed to accumulate.<br><br>
Antioxidative capacity in the whole organism is a means to reflect the organism's capability to withstand oxidative stress and protect cell membrane and cytosolic components against free radical damage. The higher the antioxidative capacity the higher its ability to neutralize free radicals and arrest the chain effect of free radical damage thereby playing a vital role in maintaining the health and integrity of individual cells.<br>
Trisodium L-ascorbic acid-2-monophosphate and sodium-calcium L-ascorbic acid-2-monophosphate are commercially available, e.g. from Roche Vitamins AG, Switzerland, under the tradename STAY-C®50 and STAY-C®35, respectively. Suitably, these salts are present in the pet food compositions of this invention in a concentration of from about 0.001 % by weight to about 5 % by weight, preferably in a concentration of from about 0.01 % by weight to about 3 % by weight, more preferably in a concentration of from about 0.1 % by weight to about 1 % by weight<br>
The polymer that may additionally be present in the per food compositions of this invention may be a homopolymer or a copolymer or mixtures thereof. Polymers capable of improving the uptake and retention of an ascorbic acid derivative in the oral cavity for use in the compositions of the present invention are natural or synthetic polymers which can be non-ionic, anionic, cationic or amphoteric. Natural polymers are preferred. Examples of natural polymers for use in the present invention are polysaccharides such as carrageenan, guar gum, galactoarabinan and pectin, and derivatives thereof, especially cellullose derivatives such as hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, quaternized hydroxyethylcellulose (Polymer JR 400, Polyquaternium 10), guar derivatives which are known as Jaguar types, and cellulose-based anionic polysaccharides such as celluloseacetatphthalat. Examples of synthetic polymers are non-ionic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone and copolymers thereof with vinyl acetate; polyvinylalcohol, polyethyleneglycol und block copolymers of the ABA-type from polyethyleneglycol-polypropyleneglycol-polyethyleneglycol. Examples of anionic synthetic polymers are especially polyacrylic acid, polymethacrylic acid and their copolymers as well as copolymers of itaconic acid and styrene sulfonic acid.<br>
Examples of cationic (or basic) polymers are copolymers, based on vinyl imidazol or dimethylaminoethyl methacrylamide (quaternized or non-quaternized). An amphoteric polymers is, e.g., Amphomer (National Starch).<br>
More specifically, examples of polymers for use in the present invention are Guar gum;<br><br>
-	pectin;<br>
-	carboxymethylcdlulose;<br>
-	quaternized hydroxyethyicellulose, e.g., Polyquaternium 10;<br>

-	polyvinyl pyrrolidone homopolymers as commercially available as PVP types;<br>
-	N-vinylpyrrolidone/acrylic acid copolymers as disclosed in EP 0 691 124 as AVP.<br>
The polymer is suitably be used in an amount of from about to about 0.01 % by weight to about 5% by weight, preferably about 0.01 % by weight to about 3% by weight, based on the total weight of the pet food composition<br>
The pet food according to the present invention may be based on any conventional pet food. There is a wide range of pet foods available which may be grouped into (a) complete diets, (b) complementary diets, and (c) snacks and treats. Complete diets may be fed in addition to water for an extended period as the sole source of nutrients and will provide for all the energetic and nutrient needs of the animal and the physiological state for which it is intended. Complementary diets normally are not sufficient to ensure that all nutrient and energy requirements are met unless fed in combination with another foodstuff or diet. Snacks and treats are appetizers or for occasional feeding and are considered as complementary products. There are, however, a number of products available intended to form part of the daily diet or playing a role in animal well-being, e.g. dental chews. In the present invention dental chews are especially suitable.<br>

A preferred pet food composition of the present invention is in the form of a treat.<br>
Inventive Ingredients may be incorporated into conventional pet food e.g., into dry pet food by spraying an aqueous solution containing one or more Inventive Ingredients on the food composition while thoroughly mixing the composition, or by adding one or more Inventive Ingredients to the dough. Inventive Ingredients may be added simultaneously, e.g. at the same time and even as a premix, or consecutively as single Inventive Ingredient at a time or as a premix. Premixes may also include one or more of the other components of the final composition.<br>
Dry food may be prepared, e.g., by screw extrusion including cooking, shaping and cutting of raw ingredients into a specific kibble shape and size in a very short period of time, while simultaneously destroying detrimental micro-organisms. The ingredients may be mixed into homogenous expandable dough and cooked in an extruder (steam/pressure) and forced through a plate under pressure and high heat After cooking, the kibbles are then allowed to cool, before optionally being sprayed with a coating which may include liquid fat or digest including liquid or powdered hydrolyzed forms of an animal tissue such as fiver or intestine from, e.g., chicken or rabbit. Hot air drying then reduces the total moisture content to 10 % or less.<br>
Canned (wet) food may be prepared, e.g., by blending the raw ingredients including meats and vegetables, fatty acids, gelling agents, gravies, vitamins, minerals and water.<br><br>
The mix is then fed into cans on a production line, the lids are sealed on and the filled cans are sterilized at a temperature of about 130°C for about 50 to 100 min.<br>
The pet foods of the present invention are useful in preventing or treating calculus, plaque, gingivitis and periodontal disease in pets, and for enhancing the antioxidative capacity in the whole organism of the animal.<br>
The present invention provides the use of the composition of the invention in preventing or treating calculus, plaque, gingivitis and periodontal disease in pets, and for enhancing the antioxidative capacity in the whole organism.<br>
The effect of the composition of the invention maybe determined by various assays. The amount of plaque forming bacteria may be determined by counting the bacteria commonly considered responsible for the pathogenesis of periodontitis, e.g. Streptococcus mutans, Eikenella corrodens and Porphyromonas gingivalis, and further Prevotella ssp, Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedins, AcHnobadllus and Actinobacillus. For example, subgingival plaque may be taken from the maxillary premolars of dogs with a scalar. Saliva, tongue dorsum and bucal mucosa may be obtained as cotton swabs. Each specimen may be placed immediately, e.g., in sterile oxygen free tubes containing, e.g. 10 ml GAM broth and stored in an anaerobic glove box with 70 % N2&gt; 15% C02, and 15% H2. The diluted suspension of each sample may, e.g., be placed on Brain Heart Infusion agar with 7% horse blood for total counts, and Brucella HK agar with 7% horse blood for counts of genus Porphyromonas as black-pigmented bacteria. Identification and bacterial count of representative colonies may be carried out using Rapid ANA II system, AIP 20A and API-ZYM systems. For Streptococcus mutans a Brain Heart Infusion would be used, too. The conditions used would be aerobic. After incubation at 37°C for 48 hours, MICs would be estimated using the systems mentioned above.<br>
Gingivitis (oral inflammation) maybe determined by measuring the gingival index, a method for estimating severity of inflammation of the gums.<br>
To determine changes in, especially, white blood cells, a total blood count may be carried out.<br>
- Red blood cell count: Hemoglobin, hematocrit, number of erythrocytes, erythrocyte indices MCHC, MCH, MCV.<br><br>
- White blood cell count: Total number of leukocytes, differential blood count (Basophiles, neutrophils, eosinophiles, monocytes, thrombocytes, B - and T-lymphocytes) relative and absolute.<br>
The cellular profile may be used to determine changes in the humoral immune system. Therefore IgA and IgG concentration may be estimated.<br>
Parameters for the determination of the antioxidant capacity include TEAC (Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity) which may be measured, e.g. after a 1:1 dilution with a spctrophotometer, on which absorbance values were recorded over 3 minutes , according to the method of Armstrong and Browne, Adv Exp Med Biol 366:43-58 (1994), Total Antioxidant Capacity (TAC), Erythrocyte Superoxid Dismutase (SOD) which may, e.g., be determined based on the method developed by McCord and Fridovich, J Biol Chem 244:6056-63 (1969) coupling 02-generators (xanthine and xanthine oxidase (XOD)) with an Or-detector [2-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenol)-5-phenyltetrazolium chloride] and monitoring absorbance in a spectrophotometer; Ferritin which may be determined by an enzyme-linked immunoassay, Ceruloplasmin which may be determined by a colorimetric method to determine ceruloplasmin oxidase activity; Vitamin E and C; CK; GOT which may be determined by using a fluorescence detector at a wavelength of 334 nm.<br>
The effect of STAY-C®50 will now be illustrated in more detail by the following experimental results. These results are described with reference to the drawing. In the drawing,<br>

Experiments:<br>
18 domestic shorthair (DSH) breed cats (mean age 3.83+1.85 years, mean body weight 4.2+1.1 kg) were divided by age and gender into two equal groups (n=9) to be fed for 28 days with a<br>
-	control diet or<br>
-	treatment diet (2.3 g STAY-C* 50/kg cat food)<br>
As the "dean tooth" model was used, all cats received a dental cleaning consisting of ultrasonic scaling and, where necessary, using an abrasor after Gracey, before the beginning of the study. The animals were then treated with the diets for 28 days. The analysis of the different indices were carried out according known methods.<br>

Pet food composition<br>
The present invention relates to pet food compositions which are useful for preventing or treating calculus, plaque, gingivitis and periodontal disease in pets, and for enhancing the antioxidative capacity in the whole organism of the animal.<br>
More particularly the present invention, in a first aspect, relates to pet food compositions, comprising trisodium acid-2-monophosphate or sodium-calcium L-ascorbic acid-2-monophosphate, or mixtures thereof.<br>
In a further aspect, the present invention relates to pet food compositions, comprising trisodium L-ascorbic acid-2-monophosphate or sodium-calcium L-ascorbic acid-2-monophosphate, or mixtures thereof and a polymer for improving the uptake and retention of trisodium L-ascorbic acid-2-monophosphate or sodium-calcium L-ascorbic acid-2-monophosphate in the oral cavity and on the teeth surface.<br>
In a particular aspect of the present invention, the L-ascorbic acid-2-monophosphate is trisodium L-ascorbic acid-2-monophosphate.<br>
The present invention further relates to any of the aforementioned compositions for use in the manufacture of a pet food, particularly for preventing or treating calculus, plaque, gingivitis and periodontal disease in pets, and for enhancing the antioxidative capacity in the whole organism.<br>
The term "pet" as used herein includes dogs, cats and rodents, e.g., chinchillas, guinea pigs, degus, mice, gerbils, hamsters, rats, ferrets and lagomorphes, e.g., rabbits. Animals of all ages are included, e.g. adults, animals of medium age and seniors. Of primary interest with respect to the present invention are dogs and cats.<br>
Plaque is a soft, gelatinous material composed of bacteria and their metabolic byproducts, oral debris, and salivary components. Mature plaque is not removed by normal actions of the tongue or by rising of the mouth. Rather, mechanical abrasion from chewing or tooth brushing is necessary for plaque removal.<br><br>
Left undisturbed, aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria proliferate as the plaque thickens and matures. Over time, salivary calcium salts are deposited on the plaque, producing calculus. Calculus is a hard deposit that provides a rough surface, promoting accumulation of more plaque and also contributing to tissue damage as it extends into the gingival sulcus. Gingivitis occurs when plaque and calculus form at the neck of the tooth, leading to inflammation and tissue damage. As the gingival sulcus enlarges into a periodontal pocket, the area provides an oxygen-depleted environment that allows proliferation of anaerobic bacteria. Periodontal disease becomes established when the periodontal ligament is exposed to plaque, bacteria, and bacterial byproducts.<br>
In some animals gingivitis persists without progressing into periodontitis. However, in most, untreated gingivitis eventually progresses to periodontal disease. Clinical signs of gingivitis and periodontal disease include oral malodor, gingival sensitivity and bleeding, tooth loss, and difficulty in eating.<br>
The presence and proliferation of certain species of anaerobic bacteria and the inflammatory responses of the host contribute to the progressive destruction of the periodontium. As the supporting connective tissues and adjacent bone are weakened, teeth become loose and may be lost. Periodontal disease itself causes discomfort and pain and, if left untreated, can lead to bacteremia.<br>
Odontoclasts resorptive lesions in cats also have been associated with gingival inflammation and, possibly, periodontal disease.<br>
Since the majority of periodontal pathogens are gram-negative bacteria which release endotoxins (lipopolysaccharides - LPS) dental diseases are a potential risk factor for systemic disease in pets resulting in a systemic bacteremia or LPS challenge.<br>
The importance of maintaining healthy periodontal tissues is of greater significance when considered that chronic periodontal disease my have a systemic as well as local effects. The most important factor that influences the development of gingivitis and periodontal disease in the dog and cat is the presence and persistence of undisturbed plaque on tooth surface. Once plaque has been deposited on the surface of the tooth, it may be reduced mechanically through abrasion provided by diet, chewing on supplemental chew toys or foods. The use of antimicrobial agents like chlorhexidine digluconate in conjunction with brushing, and the use of a chemical mouthwash is not effective in removing the hardened calculus that forms when plaque is allowed to accumulate.<br><br>
Antioxidative capacity in the whole organism is a means to reflect the organism's capability to withstand oxidative stress and protect cell membrane and cytosolic components against free radical damage. The higher the antioxidative capacity the higher its ability to neutralize free radicals and arrest the chain effect of free radical damage thereby playing a vital role in maintaining the health and integrity of individual cells.<br>
Trisodium L-ascorbic acid-2-monophosphate and sodium-calcium L-ascorbic acid-2-monophosphate are commercially available, e.g. from Roche Vitamins AG, Switzerland, under the tradename STAY-C®50 and STAY-C®35, respectively. Suitably, these salts are present in the pet food compositions of this invention in a concentration of from about 0.001 % by weight to about 5 % by weight, preferably in a concentration of from about 0.01 % by weight to about 3 % by weight, more preferably in a concentration of from about 0.1 % by weight to about 1 % by weight<br>
The polymer that may additionally be present in the per food compositions of this invention may be a homopolymer or a copolymer or mixtures thereof. Polymers capable of improving the uptake and retention of an ascorbic acid derivative in the oral cavity for use in the compositions of the present invention are natural or synthetic polymers which can be non-ionic, anionic, cationic or amphoteric. Natural polymers are preferred. Examples of natural polymers for use in the present invention are polysaccharides such as carrageenan, guar gum, galactoarabinan and pectin, and derivatives thereof, especially cellullose derivatives such as hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, quaternized hydroxyethylcellulose (Polymer JR 400, Polyquaternium 10), guar derivatives which are known as Jaguar types, and cellulose-based anionic polysaccharides such as celluloseacetatphthalat. Examples of synthetic polymers are non-ionic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone and copolymers thereof with vinyl acetate; polyvinylalcohol, polyethyleneglycol und block copolymers of the ABA-type from polyethyleneglycol-polypropyleneglycol-polyethyleneglycol. Examples of anionic synthetic polymers are especially polyacrylic acid, polymethacrylic acid and their copolymers as well as copolymers of itaconic acid and styrene sulfonic acid.<br>
Examples of cationic (or basic) polymers are copolymers, based on vinyl imidazol or dimethylaminoethyl methacrylamide (quaternized or non-quaternized). An amphoteric polymers is, e.g., Amphomer (National Starch).<br>
More specifically, examples of polymers for use in the present invention are Guar gum;<br><br>

The polymer is suitably be used in an amount of from about to about 0.01 % by weight to about 5% by weight, preferably about 0.01 % by weight to about 3% by weight, based on the total weight of the pet food composition<br>
The pet food according to the present invention may be based on any conventional pet food. There is a wide range of pet foods available which may be grouped into (a) complete diets, (b) complementary diets, and (c) snacks and treats. Complete diets may be fed in addition to water for an extended period as the sole source of nutrients and will provide for all the energetic and nutrient needs of the animal and the physiological state for which it is intended. Complementary diets normally are not sufficient to ensure that all nutrient and energy requirements are met unless fed in combination with another foodstuff or diet. Snacks and treats are appetizers or for occasional feeding and are considered as complementary products. There are, however, a number of products available intended to form part of the daily diet or playing a role in animal well-being, e.g. dental chews. In the present invention dental chews are especially suitable.<br>

A preferred pet food composition of the present invention is in the form of a treat.<br>
Inventive Ingredients may be incorporated into conventional pet food e.g., into dry pet food by spraying an aqueous solution containing one or more Inventive Ingredients on the food composition while thoroughly mixing the composition, or by adding one or more Inventive Ingredients to the dough. Inventive Ingredients may be added simultaneously, e.g. at the same time and even as a premix, or consecutively as single Inventive Ingredient at a time or as a premix. Premixes may also include one or more of the other components of the final composition.<br>
Dry food may be prepared, e.g., by screw extrusion including cooking, shaping and cutting of raw ingredients into a specific kibble shape and size in a very short period of time, while simultaneously destroying detrimental micro-organisms. The ingredients may be mixed into homogenous expandable dough and cooked in an extruder (steam/pressure) and forced through a plate under pressure and high heat After cooking, the kibbles are then allowed to cool, before optionally being sprayed with a coating which may include liquid fat or digest including liquid or powdered hydrolyzed forms of an animal tissue such as fiver or intestine from, e.g., chicken or rabbit. Hot air drying then reduces the total moisture content to 10 % or less.<br>
Canned (wet) food may be prepared, e.g., by blending the raw ingredients including meats and vegetables, fatty acids, gelling agents, gravies, vitamins, minerals and water.<br><br>
The mix is then fed into cans on a production line, the lids are sealed on and the filled cans are sterilized at a temperature of about 130°C for about 50 to 100 min.<br>
The pet foods of the present invention are useful in preventing or treating calculus, plaque, gingivitis and periodontal disease in pets, and for enhancing the antioxidative capacity in the whole organism of the animal.<br>
The present invention provides the use of the composition of the invention in preventing or treating calculus, plaque, gingivitis and periodontal disease in pets, and for enhancing the antioxidative capacity in the whole organism.<br>
The effect of the composition of the invention maybe determined by various assays. The amount of plaque forming bacteria may be determined by counting the bacteria commonly considered responsible for the pathogenesis of periodontitis, e.g. Streptococcus mutans, Eikenella corrodens and Porphyromonas gingivalis, and further Prevotella ssp, Bacteroides gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedins, AcHnobadllus and Actinobacillus. For example, subgingival plaque may be taken from the maxillary premolars of dogs with a scalar. Saliva, tongue dorsum and bucal mucosa may be obtained as cotton swabs. Each specimen may be placed immediately, e.g., in sterile oxygen free tubes containing, e.g. 10 ml GAM broth and stored in an anaerobic glove box with 70 % N2&gt; 15% C02, and 15% H2. The diluted suspension of each sample may, e.g., be placed on Brain Heart Infusion agar with 7% horse blood for total counts, and Brucella HK agar with 7% horse blood for counts of genus Porphyromonas as black-pigmented bacteria. Identification and bacterial count of representative colonies may be carried out using Rapid ANA II system, AIP 20A and API-ZYM systems. For Streptococcus mutans a Brain Heart Infusion would be used, too. The conditions used would be aerobic. After incubation at 37°C for 48 hours, MICs would be estimated using the systems mentioned above.<br>
Gingivitis (oral inflammation) maybe determined by measuring the gingival index, a method for estimating severity of inflammation of the gums.<br>
To determine changes in, especially, white blood cells, a total blood count may be carried out.<br>
- Red blood cell count: Hemoglobin, hematocrit, number of erythrocytes, erythrocyte indices MCHC, MCH, MCV.<br><br>
- White blood cell count: Total number of leukocytes, differential blood count (Basophiles, neutrophils, eosinophiles, monocytes, thrombocytes, B - and T-lymphocytes) relative and absolute.<br>
The cellular profile may be used to determine changes in the humoral immune system. Therefore IgA and IgG concentration may be estimated.<br>
Parameters for the determination of the antioxidant capacity include TEAC (Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity) which may be measured, e.g. after a 1:1 dilution with a spctrophotometer, on which absorbance values were recorded over 3 minutes , according to the method of Armstrong and Browne, Adv Exp Med Biol 366:43-58 (1994), Total Antioxidant Capacity (TAC), Erythrocyte Superoxid Dismutase (SOD) which may, e.g., be determined based on the method developed by McCord and Fridovich, J Biol Chem 244:6056-63 (1969) coupling 02-generators (xanthine and xanthine oxidase (XOD)) with an Or-detector [2-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenol)-5-phenyltetrazolium chloride] and monitoring absorbance in a spectrophotometer; Ferritin which may be determined by an enzyme-linked immunoassay, Ceruloplasmin which may be determined by a colorimetric method to determine ceruloplasmin oxidase activity; Vitamin E and C; CK; GOT which may be determined by using a fluorescence detector at a wavelength of 334 nm.<br>
The effect of STAY-C®50 will now be illustrated in more detail by the following experimental results. These results are described with reference to the drawing. In the drawing,<br>

Experiments:<br>
18 domestic shorthair (DSH) breed cats (mean age 3.83+1.85 years, mean body weight 4.2+1.1 kg) were divided by age and gender into two equal groups (n=9) to be fed for 28 days with a<br>
-	control diet or<br>
-	treatment diet (2.3 g STAY-C* 50/kg cat food)<br>
As the "dean tooth" model was used, all cats received a dental cleaning consisting of ultrasonic scaling and, where necessary, using an abrasor after Gracey, before the beginning of the study. The animals were then treated with the diets for 28 days. The analysis of the different indices were carried out according known methods.<br>
The results, which are partially shown in the figures 1 to 4 are as follows:<br>
-	No changes in systemic health, body weight, blood counts or serum biochemistry where observed in any of the two groups.<br>
-	Gingivitis indices in the treatment group where not increased compared to a 28% increase in control group.<br>
-	Plaque indices were reduced significantly in the treatment group.<br>
