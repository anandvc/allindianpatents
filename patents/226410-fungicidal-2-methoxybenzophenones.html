process for their preparation, compositions containing such compounds, a<br>
method for combating a fungus at a locus comprising treating the locus<br>
with such compounds and their use as fungicides.<br>
Food production relies upon a variety of agricultural technologies to<br>
ensure the growing population's dietary needs remain affordable,<br>
nutritious and readily available on grocery store shelves. Fungicides are<br>
one of these agricultural technologies which are available to the world<br>
community. Fungicides are agrochemical compounds which protect crops<br>
and foods from fungus and fungal diseases. Crops and food are<br>
constantly threatened by a variety of fungat organisms, which, if left<br>
uncontrolled, can cause ruined crops and devastated harvests.<br>
In particular, ascomycetes, the causative agent for powdery mildew<br>
diseases are an ever-present threat especially to cereal and fruit crops.<br>
However, applications of fungicidal agents at disease control rates can<br>
cause phytotoxic damage to the target plants.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are disclosed in a general<br>
formula of European patent ("EP") application EP 0 727 141, which<br>
published on August 21, 1996, The EP application discloses compounds<br>
having activity against phytopathoc enic fungi, but relatively low<br>
systemicity.<br>
There is no disclosure in the EP application of substituted<br>
benzophenones, wherein the first phenyl group is substituted by a<br>

wherein R4 represents an optionally substituted alkyl group, being different<br>
Trorn methyl, and met aenotes an alkayl metal atom preferably sodium,<br>
The compounds of formula III, wherein R2 represents a halogen<br>

of<br>
(a)	reacting a compound of formula VI,<br><br>
wherein R1 and n have the meaning given for claim 1 and R" represents a<br>
hydrogen atom or an alky! group, with a halogenating agent,<br>
(b)	optionally hydrolyzing the resulting halogenated alkyl<br>
benzoate (R" = alkyl), and<br>
(c)	optionally treating the resulting halogenated benzoic acid<br>
with thionyl chloride.<br>
The compounds of formula I, wherein R2 represents a<br>
trifluoromethyl group are preferably obtained by treating a compound of<br>
formula I, wherein R2 represents a halogen atom, with trtfluoroacetate in<br>
the presence of a copper salt at elevated temperatures<br>
The starting materials of formulae II, IV, V and VI are known<br>
products, the starting materials of formula III are partly known and partly<br>
novel products.<br>
Accordingly, the invention provides novel intermediate of formula<br>
IIIA<br><br><br>
wherein R1 represents an alkyl group, in particular a methyl group and R2<br>
represents a bromo atom or a trifluoromethyl group.<br>
The starting materials of formulae II, IV, V and VI may be prepared<br>
according to established methods or routine adaptations thereof.<br>
Substituents which are not compatible with the selected reaction<br>
conditions may be introduced after formation of the benzophenone. They<br>
may be generated by known methods such as subsequent derivatization<br>
or substitution of a suitable group or by cleaving off a suitable protecting<br>
group.<br>
The reaction between the 2-halobenzophenone of formula II and<br>
the alkali metal methylate is preferably carried out in the oresence of a<br>
solvent, such as ethers like tetrahydrofuran, diethylether, tert-butyl-<br>
methylether or dimethoxyethane or methanol or in mixtures of these<br>
solvents. The molar ratio between formula II and the alkali metal methylate<br>
is preferably in the range of 0.3 to 1.9 at a temperature between 25 and<br>
120 ºC.<br>
The Friedel Crafts reaction between formula III and IV is effected in<br>
the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst according to well-established<br>
procedures (Y = CI). Suitable catalysts include FeCI3, AICI3) SnCl4, ZnCI2,<br>
TiCI4, SbCI5 and BF3, which may be in a molar equivalent amount (based<br>
on the benzoyl chloride of formula III). However, it is also possible to use<br>
lesser amounts of catalyst at elevated temperatures, suitably under reflux<br>
temperatures, preferred catalysts under these conditions being FeCI3, l2,<br>
ZnCI2, iron, copper, strong sulphonic acids such as F3CSO3H, and acidic<br>
ion exchange resins such as Amberlyst® 15 and Nafion®. The preferred<br>
catalyst is FeCI3 in a 0.001 to 0.2 molar ratio at a temperature of about 50<br>
to 180°C. The reaction can be carried out in a solvent inert under the<br><br>
reaction conditions, for example ethylene or methylene chloride, benzene,<br>
octane, decane or solvent mixtures, or in the absence of solvent,<br>
conveniently by employing one of the reactants in excess, e. g. in the<br>
range of 1:5 to 5:1. If AlCI3 is being used, the motor ratio is preferably in<br>
the range of 0.5 to 2 and the suitable solvents are e.g. dichloromethane or<br>
ethylenechloride at a temperature usually between -10 and 70°C.<br>
In another preferred process according to the invention the benzoic<br>
acid of formula III (Y = OH) is reacted with a compound of formula IV in<br>
the presence of phosphorous pentoxide at temperatures of about 0 to 50<br>
°C, preferably at room temperature or in the presence of POCI3 at<br>
temperatures of about 50 to 150°C preferably under reflux.<br>
The halogenation of the benzoate of formula VI is preferably carried<br>
out in the presence of an inert solvent. Preferred halogenating agents are<br>
for example sulfuryl chloride, bromine and N-halo-succinimide. If R1<br>
represents a halogen atom highly polar solvents such as alcohols or<br>
carboxylic acids, in particular acetic acid are preferred. If R1 represents an<br>
alkyl group, in particular a methyl group, apolar solvents such as<br>
tetrachloromethane are preferred. If the reaction is carried out with<br>
bromine at a temperature between 0 and 40 °C, preferably at room<br>
temperature, the halogenation takes place predominately in the ortho-<br>
position with respect to radical R1<br>
In a preferred embodiment the compounds of formula III, in which<br>
R2 represents a bromo atom are prepared by reacting a compound of<br>
formula VI, wherein R1 represents an alkyl group, n is 0, and R" represents<br>
a hydrogen atom, with bromine. This bromination step is preferably carried<br>
out in the presence of a polar, protic solvent, such as an aliphatic alcohol<br>
or an aliphatic carboxylic acid in particular acetic acid. The bromination<br>
may be carried out advantageously in the presence of a weak base or a<br>
buffer system, such as sodium acetate or sodium carbonate.<br>
One embodiment of the process of the instant invention is a<br>
process wherein bromine is employed in an amount selected from a value<br><br>
in the range between 1.0 to 1.5, in particular 1.05 to 1.2 molar equivalents<br>
with respect to starting compound of formula VI.<br>
The reaction between the compound of formula VI and bromine is<br>
as a rule carried out at a temperature sufficient to optimally convert the<br>
compound of formula VI to the compound of formula III. This term<br>
represents a temperature sufficiently high to maintain the conversion, but<br>
also sufficiently low to avoid decomposition of the starting material and the<br>
product. The reaction is carried out preferably at temperatures between 0<br>
°C and 40 °C, in particular at ambient temperature.<br>
The reaction between the compound of formula VI and bromine is<br>
as a rule carried out at a length of time sufficient to optimally convert the<br>
compound of formula VI to the compound of formula II). This term<br>
represents a period of time sufficiently long to convert the maximum<br>
amount of the starting material to the compound of formula III. The<br>
reaction is carried out preferably at reaction time between 1 and 40 hours,<br>
in particular between 5 and 24 hours.<br>
The transformation of a compound ot formula I, wherein R2<br>
represents a halogen atom, into a compound of formula I, wherein one of<br>
R2 represents a trifluoromethyl group, is carried out analogously to J.<br>
Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. PT1 (1988) N4, page 924 Preferably sodium<br>
trifluoroacetate is reacted with the halogen compound in the presence of a<br>
copper salt, preferably copper-(j) hatides, in particular copper-(l) iodide. As<br>
a rule the reaction is carried out in a high-boiling polar aprotic solvent such<br>
as 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone. The reaction is carried out preferably at<br>
temperatures between 120 °C and 200 ºC, in particular between 150 °C<br>
and 170 °C.<br>
The reaction between tne compound formula I, R1 represents a<br>
halogen atom, and sodium trifluoroacetate is as a rule carried out at a<br>
length of time sufficient to optimally to transform the halogen compound<br>
into a trifluoromethyl compound. This term represents a period of time<br>
sufficiently long to convert the maximum amount of the starting material to<br>
the compound of formula I, wherein R2 represents a trifluoromethyl group.<br><br>
The reaction is carried out preferably at a reaction time between 40 and<br>
140 hours, in particular between 60 and 100 hours.<br>
The kprocesses described above and below can analogously be<br>
applied to other staring compounds, if desired.<br>
Due to excellent plant toleration, the compounds of formula I may<br>
be used in cultivation of all plants where infection by the controlled fungi is<br>
not desired, e.g. cereals, vegetables, legumes, apples, vine. The absence<br>
of target crop phototoxicity at fungus control rates is a feature of the<br>
present invention.<br>
Accordingly the invention further provides a tungicida! composition<br>
which comprises a carrier and, as active ingredient, at least one<br>
compound of formula I as defined above. A method of making such a<br>
composition is also provided which comprises bringing a compound of<br>
formula i as delned above into association with at least one carrier. Such<br>
a composition may contain a single compound or a mixture of several<br>
compounds of the present invention. It is also envisaged that different<br>
isomers or mixtures of isomers may have different levels or spectra of<br>
activity and thus compositions may comprise individual isomers or<br>
mixtures of isomers.<br>
A composition according to the invention preferably contains from<br>
0.5% to 95% by weight (w/w) of active ingredient.<br>
A carrier in a composition according to the invention is any material<br>
with which the active ingredient is formulated to facilitate application to the<br>
locus to be treated, which may for example be a plant, seed or soil, or to<br>
facilitate storage, transport or handling, A carrier may be a solid or a liquid,<br>
including material which is normallya gas butwhich has been<br>
compressed to form a liquid.<br>
The compositions may be manufactured into e.g. emulsion<br>
concentrates, solutions, oil in water emulsions, wettable powders, soluble<br>
powders, suspension concentrates, dusts, granules, water dispersible<br>
granules, micro-capsules, gels and other formulation types by well-<br>
established procedures. These procedures include intensive mixing<br><br>
and/or milling of the active ingredients with other substances, such as<br>
filters, solvents, solid carriers, surface active compounds (surfactants), and<br>
optionally solid and/or liquid auxilaries and/or adjuvants. The form of<br>
application such as spraying, atomizing, dispersing or pouring may be<br>
chosen like the compositions according to the desired objectives and the<br>
given circumstances.<br>
Solvents may be aromatic hydrocarbons, e.g. Solvesso® 200,<br>
substituted naphthalenes, phthalic acid esters, such as dibutyl or dioctyl<br>
phthalate, aliphatic hydrocarbons, e.g. cyclohexaneor paraffins, alcohols<br>
and glycols as well as their ethers and esters, e.g. ethanol, ethyleneglycol<br>
mono-and dimethyl ether, ketones such as cyclohexanone, strongly polar<br>
solvents such as N-methyl-2-pyrro!idone, or γ-butyrolactone, higher alkyl<br>
pyrrolidones, e.g. n-octylpyrrolidone or cyclohexylpyrrolidone, epoxidized<br>
plantoil esters, e.g. methylated coconut or soybean oil ester and water.<br>
Mixtures of different liquids are often suitable<br>
Solid carriers, which maybe used for dusts, wettable powders,<br>
water dispersible granules, or granules, may be mineral fillers, such as<br>
calcite, talc, kaolin, montmorillonite or attapulgile. The physical properties<br>
may be improved by addition of highly dispersed silica gel or polymers.<br>
Carriers for granules may be porous material, e.g. pumice, kaolin,<br>
sepiolite, bentonite; non-sorptive carriers may be calcite or sand.<br>
Additionally, a multitude of pre-granulated inorganic or organic materials<br>
may be used, such as dolomite or crushed plantrestdues.<br>
Pesticidal compositions are often formulated and transported in a<br>
concentrated form which is subsequently diluted by the user before<br>
application. The presence of small amounts of a carrier which is a<br>
surfactant facilitates this process of dilution. Thus, preferably at least one<br>
carrier in a composition according to the invention is a surfactant. For<br>
example, the composition may contain at two or more carriers, at least one<br>
of which is a surfactant.<br>
Surfactants may be nonionic, anionic, cationic or zwitterionic<br>
substances with good dispersing, emulsifying and wetting properties<br><br>
depending on the nature ofthe compound according to general formula I<br>
to be formulated. Surfactants may also mean mixtures of individual<br>
surfactants.<br>
The compositions of the invention may for example be formulated as<br>
wettable powders, water dispersible granules,dusts, granules, solutions,<br>
emulsifiable concentrates, emulsions, suspension concentrates and<br>
aerosols. Wettable powders usually contain 5 to 90% w/w of active<br>
ingredient and usually contain in addition to solid inert carrier, 3 to10%<br>
w/w of dispersing and wetting agents and, where necessary, 0 to 10% w/w<br>
of stabilizer(s) and/or other additives such as penetrants or stickers. Dusts<br>
are usually formulated as a dust concentrate having a similar composition<br>
to that of a wettable powder but without a dispersant, and may be diluted<br>
in the field with further solid carrier to give a composition usually<br>
containing 0.5to 10% w/w of active ingredient Water dispersible granules<br>
and granules are usually prepared to have a size between 0.15 mm and<br>
2.0 mm and may be manufactured by a variety of techniques. Generally,<br>
these types of granules will contain 0.5 to 90% w/w active ingredient and 0<br>
to 20% w/w of additives such as stabilizer, surfactants, slow release<br>
modifiers and binding agents. The so-called "dry flowables" consist of<br>
relatively small granules having a relatively high concentration of active<br>
ingredient. Emulsifiable ooncentrates usually contain, in addition to a<br>
solvent or a mixture of solvents, 1 to 80% w/v active ingredient, 2 to 20%<br>
w/v emulsifiers and 0 to 20% w/v of other additives such as stabilizers,<br>
penetrants and corrosion inhibitors. Suspension concentrates are usually<br>
milled so as to obtain a stable, non-sedimenting flowable product:and<br>
usually contain 5 to 75% w/v active ingredient 0.5 to 15% w/v of<br>
dispersing agents, 0.1 to 10% w/v of suspending agents such asprotective<br>
colloids and thixotropic agents, 0 to 10% w/v of other additives such as<br>
defoamers, oorrosion inhibitors, stabilizers, penetrants and stickers, and<br>
water or an organic liquid in which the active ingredient is substantially<br>
insoluble; certain organic solids or inorganic salts may be present<br><br>
dissolved in the formulation to assist in preventing sedimentation and<br>
crystalization or as antifreeze agents for water.<br>
Aqueous dispersions and emulsions, for example compositions<br>
obtained by diluting the formulated product according to the invention with<br>
water, also lie within the scope of the invention<br>
Of particular interest in enhancing the duration of the protective<br>
activity of the compounds of this invention is the use of a carrier which will<br>
provide slow release of the pesticidal compounds into the environment of<br>
a plant which is to be protected,<br>
The biological activity of the active ingredient can also be increased<br>
by including an adjuvant in the spray dilution. An adjuvant is defined here<br>
as a substance which can increase the biological activity of an active<br>
ingredient but is not itself significantly biologically active. The adjuvant can<br>
either be included in the formulation as a coformulant a carrier, or can be<br>
added to the spray tank together with the formulation containing the active<br>
ingredient.<br>
As a commodity the compositions may preferably be in a<br>
concentrated form whereas the end user generally employs diluted<br>
compositions, The compositions may be diluted to a concentration down to<br>
0.001% of active ingredient. The doses usuaify are m the range torn 0.01<br>
to 10 kg a.i./ha.<br>

and ornamental plants against fungal attack. Typical crops which may be<br>
protected include vines, grain crops such as wheat and barley, rice, sugar<br>
beet, top fruit, peanuts, potatoes, vegetables and tomatoes. The duration<br>
of the protection is normally dependent on the individual compound<br>
selected, and also a variety of external factors, such as climate, whose<br>
impact is normally mitigated by the use of a sutable formulation.<br>

Biological Investigations<br>
A Foliar Systemicity<br>
Wheat Powdery Mildew (WPM):<br>
HOST:	Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) variety Kanzler<br>
PATHOGEN: Blumeria (Ervsiphe) graminis DC, f.sp. tritioi E. Marchal<br>
TEST PROCEDURE:<br>
1.	Wheat seed (8/pot) is planted in 8 cm diameter plastic pots in the<br>
greenhouse.<br>
2.	When the primary leaf is fully expanded, the plants are cut back to<br>
four in each pot of which two are marked with a permanent marker 5<br>
cm below the leaf tip on the upper leaf surface. Thus there are two<br>
band-treated and two untreated plants in each pot.<br>
3.	A pipette is used to apply 5 μl of the formulated compound in a band<br>
on the lower leaf surface opposite the mark The application band<br>
should cover the whole leaf width. After application, the plants are not<br>
moved until the bands are dry (half an hour or so later).<br>
4.	After treated plants have dried, they are moved to the greenhouse<br>
and kept there for 2 days to allow for movement of the compounds.<br>
The plants are maintained with bottom watering.<br>
5.	Two days after application, the plants are inoculated by dusting them<br>
with powdery mildew conidia in the greenhouse. Evaluations are<br>
typically made 7 - 8 days after inoculation.<br>
Evaluation<br>
Three types of compound movement are assessed by evaluating disease<br>
in three areas of each band-treated leaf.<br>
Translaminar movement: The percent disease area is assessed for the<br>
translaminar band area (marked area of the upper leaf surface directly<br>
opposite where band was applied on the lower leaf surface; width of band<br>
approximately 5 mm). Translaminar disease control is then calculated<br>
using the following formula:<br><br><br>
Distal movement and proximal movement: The distal and proximal<br>
disease-free zones on the upper leaf surface are measured in mm. The<br>
distal direction is from the band toward the leaf apex sand the proximal<br>
direction is from the band toward the leaf base. The percent of the<br>
disease-free zone relative to the entire distance between the band and<br>
leaf apex or base is calculated. If disease is noticeably lighter in the distal<br>
or proximal area this is also noted.<br>
FORMULATION AND CONTROLS:<br>
