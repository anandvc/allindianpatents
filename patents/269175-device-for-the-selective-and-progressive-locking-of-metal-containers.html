Title:	"Device for the selective and progressive locking of metal<br>
containers"<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention relates to a device for the selective and progressive<br>
locking of metal containers.<br>
More particularly, the present invention relates to a device apt to lock in a<br>
selective and progressive manner metal containers to be submitted to<br>
mechanical deformation operations along extended part of their side surface.<br>
The above mentioned metal containers are the same of the known art and<br>
typically, even though non critically, those destined to realizing bottles for the<br>
aerosol market or bottles for the beverage and food market, or for technical<br>
use. Said containers, obtained from aluminum, its alloys, steel or others<br>
suitable materials, consist in raw bodies extruded or dished and drawn, which<br>
present originally a substantially cylindrical shape and which are thereafter<br>
tapered at the upper end to realize a mouthpiece or seat for a dispensing valve<br>
or to form the insert of a threaded collar. The raw bodies are fed into a known<br>
tapering machine comprising at least an intermittent motion rotating table,<br>
with a plurality of stations provided with drive organs for the themselves raw<br>
bodies temporary locking , and at least an opposed alternate traverse motion<br>
plate carrying multiple tools and chucks destined to carry out the different and<br>
sequential workings. Said workings consist in tapering the bodies top part, as<br>
well as, for instance, in cutting in size, in rimming and in possible dimensional<br>
checking of the top end of the bodies themselves. The bodies fed into the<br>
machine in a known way may be already painted externally and offset printed<br><br>
WO 2006/069609	PCT/EP2005/006673<br>
2<br>
on the external side surface, to realize over them writings or decoration<br>
elements in various colors, such as for instance the product trademark, the<br>
content type, identification codes, instructions for final consumer and the like.<br>
During the above-mentioned operations or preliminary to them, the bodies are<br>
often subjected to local deformations which concern one or more limited areas<br>
of their side surface, at the bottom of their upper part to be tapered and near<br>
the same. Such deformations, named embossing/debossing, are realized with<br>
specific tools, that create upon prearranged areas of the bodies side surface<br>
shaped imprints, grooves and other configurations of various shape defined by<br>
notched and/or projecting sectors.<br>
The correct localization of the bodies portion(s) onto which to realize said<br>
imprints depends from their angular position detecting specific working means:<br>
to this end, the above-mentioned bodies are suitably provided along the top<br>
edge by one or more optical reading signals, that are highlighted during a<br>
rotational phase to which they are subjected for suitable orientation.<br>
This type of deformations in embossing/debossing shape is primarily realized<br>
to give aesthetic valences to the bodies, but it also shows partly functional<br>
characteristics as far as the final user is concerned, given the relieves shaped<br>
on the originally planar surface, of having a more comfortable and safe grip on<br>
the bodies themselves. Both to realize the tapering, and to obtain<br>
embossing/debossing localized prints, the bodies require to be gripped and<br>
stabilized during the deformation interventions carried out by the various tools.<br>
To this purpose, said bodies fed on tapering machines are inserted starting<br>
from the bottom in suitable grip members, so called pliers, that circumscribe<br><br>
WO 2006/069609	PCT/EP2005/006673<br>
3<br>
an extended side surface part, between around 40 and 60 mm. Thanks to such<br>
gripping sizeable extension, the bodies are stabilized in an effective way, and<br>
also precisely axially aligned, and are not influenced by radial and/or axial<br>
loads to which they are subjected during these conventional deformation<br>
determining phases. On the contrary, to day a need is felt to realize aerosol,<br>
beverage, food and other purpose metal containers, in aluminum, its alloys or<br>
other suitable materials, provided with extended shaping of their side surface,<br>
non-circumscribed or not only circumscribed to a limited area upon or near the<br>
top one to be tapered. Such a need is felt primarily because said containers<br>
show intrinsically features that make them apt to various uses, for instance for<br>
food products packaging and distribution, with total hygiene guarantee, and<br>
that further allow to substantially limit the unit package weight, also for<br>
disposal and recycling, compared to other conventional packages made by for<br>
instance glass. The glass containers, however, are easily subjected to break.<br>
Further it is easily noticeable that to-day some types of glass containers have<br>
aesthetic valences superior compared to the so far known metal ones and<br>
these characteristics are some times such to orient the final consumer in a<br>
direction, to the detriment of more advantageous others.<br>
The extended deformation of the metal containers side surface nevertheless<br>
provides considerable problems, that cannot be solved using conventional<br>
techniques through which one obtains the top surface tapering and the<br>
localized prints in embossing/debossing shape. Said extended deformation,<br>
whose purpose is to shape according to the most various configurations the<br>
side surface of the above-mentioned containers, shows in fact a substantial<br><br>
WO 2006/069609	PCT/EP2005/006673<br>
4<br>
limitation concerning their stabilizing and maintaining constantly in a precise<br>
position. Conventional grip pliers, as above-mentioned, grip containers starting<br>
from the bottom and extend themselves along their side surface for a sizeable<br>
portion, that allows to achieve such precise fixing during working; the<br>
tapering operations concern the containers top part and the<br>
embossing/debossing ones of the adjacent area, so that the pliers can freely<br>
surround a side surface wide area.<br>
Since, one has to operate on the side surface in a wider manner, with<br>
deformations that develop from the underlying to the tapering area up to near<br>
the containers base, the pliers gripping area reduces itself mandatorily starting<br>
from the bottom, with the consequence that the containers themselves correct<br>
stabilization and constant alignment would not be assured. Even the locking<br>
force, circumscribed to a limited area of the containers side surface starting<br>
from their bottom, may show critical aspects and, for this reason, said<br>
containers undergo preferably a mechanical deformation preliminary operation<br>
that interests specifically the bottom surface, that is suitably stiffened by<br>
molding or partial dishing carried out on the operating machine or near it.<br>
It should be noted that a deformation intervention widely extended of the side<br>
surface submits the containers to much higher loads as compared to those<br>
that can be found in the known deformation proceedings, due to the robust<br>
efforts of the working tools that are used on an area with a greater<br>
longitudinal development. It is therefore necessary providing specific and<br>
effective initial locking means and subsequent said containers stable<br>
maintenance, remarkably embossed starting from the gripping area of their<br><br>
WO 2006/069609	PCT/EP2005/006673<br>
5<br>
bottom, means which take into account the presence of a top (ever arm<br>
compared to that which is found in known deformation proceedings, such that<br>
it leads to amplification of the maladjustment at the containers themselves<br>
opposite free end. Thanks only to such means one can avoid the<br>
inconveniences following the incorrect integration between the tools which are<br>
used on the bodies in working.<br>
Scope of the present invention is to provide such specific means.<br>
More particularly, the scope of the present invention is to provide a metal<br>
containers selective and progressive locking device, specifically destined to the<br>
realization of aerosol market bottles or bottles for beverage, food or other<br>
purposes, adapted to initially stabilize in an effective manner and to keep<br>
thereafter equally locked the containers themselves, even if said last are<br>
gripped along a limited area of the side surface starting from the bottom.<br>
Further scope of the invention is to provide a locking device as described<br>
above adapted to keep said containers in constant axial alignment position<br>
during the deformation operations, notwithstanding the high loads which<br>
undergo the containers themselves by the tools that are used along an<br>
extended area of their side surface.<br>
Further scope of the invention is to provide users with a metal containers<br>
selective and progressive locking device adapted to guarantee a high strength<br>
level in time, further such as to be easily and low priced realized.<br>
According to the present invention, this and also other scopes are achieved by<br>
the metal containers selective and progressive locking device that are subject<br><br><br>
WO 2006/069609	PCT/EP2005/006673<br>
6<br>
to mechanical deformation operations along a wide area of side surface and<br>
provided on the bottom of a notch, said device comprising:<br>
-	a circular plan support with an end forming a seat mouthpiece of a<br>
containment body;<br>
-	a shaped and movable ring eventually cooperating with a seal or annular<br>
membrane placed at the mouthpiece in which containers are inserted<br>
starting from their bottom;<br>
-	a centering collar that defines the mouthpiece in which containers are<br>
inserted and that circumscribes the seal;<br>
-	a centering ring whose anterior front towards the containers shows<br>
complementary conformation to the containers themselves bottom<br>
periphery and is provided with a plurality of through holes;<br>
-	a pusher tensioned by a helical spring, placed along the device longitudinal<br>
axis;<br>
-	means adapted to realize perfect adherence with the bottom of container<br>
provided with notch.<br>
The construction and functional characteristics of the locking device of the<br>
present invention may be better understood from the following description,<br>
that refers to the accompanying drawings tables which represent a preferred<br>
and non limitative embodiment and in which:<br>
figure 1 shows schematically a longitudinal section of the locking device of the<br>
present invention<br>
figure 2 shows schematically, in side view, an example of metal container<br>
provided with extended shaping of the side surface;<br><br>
WO 2006/069609	PCT/EP2005/006673<br>
7<br>
figure 3 shows a partial enlargement of figure 1, particularly of the locking<br>
device of the present invention front part;<br>
figure 4 and 5 show further enlarged details of figure 3.<br>
Referring to the above-mentioned figures, the present invention metal<br>
containers selective and progressive locking device, indicated in the ensemble<br>
as 10 at figure 1, comprises a circular plan support 12 defining at one end a<br>
seat mouthpiece 14 for a containment body 16, projecting from the support<br>
itself on the anterior front towards the container to submit to extensive<br>
forming interventions in the side surface.<br>
Said container is indicated at 18 in figure 1 and is also represented in a side<br>
view at figure 2; in this last one, container 18 is shown by exemplification<br>
according to two configurations corresponding to different working phases,<br>
that is top half-part WS1" provided with said large forming and with bottom<br>
half-part "S2" upon which is also carried out the following tapering operation in<br>
the area next to the mouthpiece. The container 18 forming, as shown from<br>
figure 2 extends for a considerable part of the side surface, preferably<br>
involving the full area comprised between the bottom, from which is spaced<br>
for a limited stroke, indicated as "A" and exemplary comprised between 10 and<br>
30 mm, and the opposite top portion, indicated as "B", destined to the<br>
following deformation operation. The container 18 side surface part interested<br>
to forming is therefore quite extended, indicated as "C", and limits therefore '<br>
the gripping area starting from container 18 bottom.<br>
Last, as above-mentioned, is provided earlier on said bottom with a<br>
mechanical deformation, obtained by known devices, that creates a recess or<br><br>
WO 2006/069609	PCT/EP2005/006673<br>
8<br>
partial dishing 20 conformed, for instance, at spherical dome, adapted from<br>
one side to stiffen the container itself along the bottom and, on the other, to<br>
create a precise coupling seat with stabilization means as will be explained<br>
next.<br>
To the containment body 16, seated in the support 12 mouthpiece, is coupled<br>
a shaped ring 22 preferably cooperating with a sea! or annular membrane 24,<br>
placed at the mouthpiece on which the containers 18 are placed starting from<br>
their bottom and held there by a centering collar 26. The shaped ring 22 may<br>
be realized in metal or other suitable material and comprise two or more<br>
complementary sectors, radially movable with any means suitable for locking<br>
circumferentially containers 18. Correspondingly or next to said mouthpiece<br>
housing containers 18 a radial conduit 28 is realized, through which is blown<br>
pressurized fluid, typically air. The fluid blown in by the conduit 28 determines<br>
the backward movement of the shaped ring 22, serving as a piston or pusher<br>
with respect to seal 24, that expands radially towards the inside embracing<br>
and restricting the container 18. It may be noted, from figure 1, that the<br>
container 18 area upon which said seal acts, with or in combination with collar<br>
26 front exposed end . is very limited dimensionally, given that it is needed to<br>
let free the whole container 18 part that develops from such proximity<br>
towards the opposed end to allow extensive deformation in the container itself<br>
along its side surface area "C". A so limited container 18 gripping and<br>
stabilizing point does not result therefore sufficient to its stable locking, nor to<br>
its axial alignment during operations, so that, according to the present<br>
invention, it is necessary to provide other holding means for this. To the<br><br>
WO 2006/069609	PCT/EP2005/006673<br>
9<br>
purpose, in an advantageous way, device 10 comprises a centering ring 30,<br>
coaxial to the shaped ring 22, whose anterior front, towards the mouthpiece in<br>
which containers 18 are placed, is shaped in a corresponding way as the<br>
containers themselves bottom periphery, specifically in their annular zone<br>
external to such mouthpiece or partial dishing 20. Further, device 10 comprises<br>
a pusher 32, tensioned for instance by one or more helical springs 34, that<br>
develops along the device 10 longitudinal axis and carries at its front end a<br>
dish 36 having a precisely complimentary configuration to notch 20 realized on<br>
container 18 bottom. The centering ring 30 and dish 36 are provided with a<br>
plurality of through holes, through which a forced air suction is carried out, for<br>
instance starting from one or more conduits 31 realized on support 12.<br>
The air void determines container 18 stabilization or pre-stabilization starting<br>
from its bottom surface, to which dish 36 is coupled precisely, and also<br>
centering ring 30 that houses the periphery of container 18 above-mentioned<br>
bottom, realizing a perfect adherence between complimentary parts. In the<br>
basis of the combined air void and seal or annular membrane 24 effect, that is<br>
deformed by the axial sliding of the shaped ring 22 and consequently locks<br>
container 18 perimeterly in the next to bottom area, said container results<br>
stabilized in an optimal way in device 10, even if it is gripped along a minor<br>
area of its side surface.<br>
This way also the precise axial alignment of container 18 is guaranteed duririg<br>
the various operational phases that lead to the shaping of "C" area of its side<br>
surface.<br><br>
WO 2006/069609	PCT/EP2005/006673<br>
10<br>
During or after such operations, may be carried out on containers 18 even one<br>
or more embossing/debossing interventions which lead to the creation of as<br>
many projecting or recessed prints along their shaped side surface, for<br>
instance in the area next to "B" portion that is tapered next. As an example, a<br>
similar print is sketched with 40 at figure 2.<br>
As will be detailed, the embossing/debossing realization supposes angular<br>
containers 18 orientation and therefore it is necessary they have the possibility<br>
to rotate around themselves once inserted in device 10.<br>
To the purpose, this last comprises elastic means 42, for instance in shape of<br>
cup or helical springs, placed between holding body 16 and support 12 or,<br>
preferably, between a sleeve 44 coaxial with shaped ring 22 and centering ring<br>
30, as shown at figure 3. Said elastic means 42 match, at the front end<br>
towards the centering ring 30, a bearing comprising a rear fixed part 46 and a<br>
rotating front part 48, this latter in contact with centering ring 30 itself.<br>
Bearing fixed part 46 and rotating part 48, together with elastic means 42, is<br>
sketched in detail at figure 5. The above-mentioned bearing is peripherically<br>
delimited by an annular member 50, coaxial to shaped ring 22. Perimetrally to<br>
centering ring 30 a solid annular collar 52 is realized, that matches a shoulder<br>
54 realized on the shaped ring 22, along its front part next to the mouthpiece<br>
on which container 18 is inserted. In device 10 non-operational conditions,<br>
that is in the absence of a container 18 placed in said mouthpiece and axially<br>
pushed therein by known feeding means, springs 42 are extended and keep<br>
collar 52 of centering ring 30 in beat against shaped ring 22 shoulder 54,<br>
avoiding its rotation. At the time the container (18) is inserted starting from<br><br>
WO 2006/069609	PCT/EP2005/006673<br>
11<br>
the bottom in device (10) mouthpiece, perfect adherence takes place between<br>
said bottom on the one side and the dish 36 with the centering ring (30)<br>
adjacent shaped part. Such perfect adherence is kept by activation of the air<br>
vacuum starting from conduit/s 31. The conventional container (18) feeding<br>
means in device (10) push the container itself against plate 36 and centering<br>
ring 30; the latter, on its part, pushes on the bearing rotating part 48 and<br>
upper fixed part 46. Elastic means 42, accordingly, compress and allow<br>
centering ring 30 backward movement, for a limited stroke; this latter annular<br>
collar 52, therefore, disengages from shaped ring 22 shoulder 54 and said<br>
centering ring 30 is free to rotate. Together with centering ring 30 rotate<br>
container 18, dish 36 and the bearing front part. Between dish 36 and pusher<br>
32 is advantageously interposed a further roll bearing 37 or the like, adapted<br>
to avoid that the dish rotation involves also said support 32. Obtained<br>
container 18 suitable angular orientation, following its rotation dictated by for<br>
themselves known means, the push effect on the container itself ends; elastic<br>
means 42 extend and centering ring 30 annular collar 52 return in contact with<br>
shoulder 54. At this time container 18 may undergo operational deformation<br>
phases along its side surface extended area "C"; to the purpose, said container<br>
is locked also at seal or expandable membrane 24, that is driven to expande<br>
radially to circumferentially block container 18 itself in its limited extension<br>
area "A", comprised between the bottom provided with the notch 20 and<br>
above-mentioned area "C". The seal 24 expansion is determined by the shaped<br>
ring 22 axial sliding, which moves near and presses the seal itself under inlet<br>
of pressurized air in device 10 effect starting from conduit 28. The container<br><br>
WO 2006/069609	PCT7EP2005/006673<br>
12<br>
18 under these conditions is blocked, first starting from bottom whereupon<br>
acts the air vacuum that leads to a perfect adherence and a perfect coupling of<br>
bottom itself with dish 36 with centering ring 30; second, container 18 is<br>
locked also circumferentially, along near to bottom area "A", by seal 24 radially<br>
expanded due to the compression exerted on shaped ring 22. Under such safe<br>
and constant locking condition, container 18 is also perfectly axially aligned<br>
and is able to support the deformation tools high loads even though it is<br>
considerably projected from the grip zone. Of course, if containers do not<br>
require being through rotation angularly oriented, because it is unnecessary to<br>
create thereupon embossing/debossing shaped prints, centering ring 30<br>
backward movement does not take place; device 10, in such case, may be<br>
without at least elastic means 42 and eventually of bearing front 48 and/or<br>
back 46 part. Even though the solution to lock by air vacuum containers 18<br>
starting from the bottom, other equivalent means may be used alternatively to<br>
this purpose; such locking may take place, for instance, through magnets if<br>
containers 18 are in ferromagnetic material or through suction cups or the like.<br>
As may be noted from the above, the advantages which the invention achieves<br>
are evident.<br>
The locking device of the present invention allows to lock, keep stabilized and<br>
axially aligned containers 18 during working phases that deform side surface<br>
extended part "C" even in the presence of an area next to bottom limited grip<br>
point, given the effects of the air vacuum, that exerts itself substantially on the<br>
whole bottom surface, and of seal 24, thus realizing the perfect adherence<br><br>
WO 2006/069609	PCT/EP2005/006673<br>
13<br>
between the bottom itself on the one side and dish 36 and centering 30 on the<br>
other.<br>
Further advantageous is the possibility to orient if on occurrence containers 18<br>
to create upon them embossing/debossing shaped prints, thanks to centering<br>
ring 30 temporary backward displacement while it is preferably being activated<br>
the air vacuum that assures sufficient treatment of containers themselves.<br>
Even though the invention has been described above referring particularly to<br>
one its preferred and not limitative embodiment, various modifications and<br>
variations will be apparent to an expert in the art in view of the above-<br>
described description. Thus, the present invention, tends to encompass all<br>
modifications and variation? within the protective spirit and scope of the<br>
appended claims.<br><br>
