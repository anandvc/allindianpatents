The present invention relates to a cosmetic composition containing a neuropeptide Y receptor antagon¬ist. Neuropeptide Y, referred to hereinbelow as "NFY" for short, is a neuromediator which is involved in a certain number of physiological processes and for which an involvement in regulating lipolysis has been demonstrated (P. Valet and M. J. Clin. Invest. 1990, 85, 291-295). NPY receptor antagonists, hereinafter referred to as "NPY antagonists", have been described as medicines, but their efficacy in the treatment of any disease has not been proven to date.<br>
It has now been found that NPY antagonists can be used for the preparation of cosmetic compositions.<br>
More particularly, it has been found that cos¬metic compositions containing an NPY-antagonist component can be used as lypolysis/lypogenesis regulators in the skin without, however, interferring with the skin's natural functions.<br>
It has also been found, that cosmetic compositions containing an NPY-antagonist component and an ^-antagon¬ist component are particularly advantageous.<br>
Thus, according to one of its aspects, the present invention relates to a cosmetic composition containing at least one NPY-antagonist component mixed with a cosmetic excipient. The NPY antagonist contained in the cosmetic composition may be a non-pep tide com¬pound, a peptide, a cell or tissue extract of animal or plant origin or a product obtained by fermentation of a microorganism, for example a bacterium or a fungus.<br>
NPY antagonists which are advantageous in the cosmetic compositions of the present invention are those of groups A, B and C below.<br>
A. Synthetic products selected from groups (I) to (VIII) below are advantageous NPY-antagonist components. t. Compounds of formula (I)<br><br><br>

C. NPY-antagonist products, in particular extracts with NFY-antagonist activity, which can be obtained by extrac¬tion of cells or tissues of animal or plant origin or by fermentation of microorganisms, in particular bacteria and fungi, for example yeasts, are advantageous NPY-antagonist components in the cosmetic compositions of the present invention.<br>
Particularly advantageous and even preferred products of this class are the products of groups XV, XVI and XVII illustrated below.<br><br>

extraction of a sponge, Orina. sp. Gray (or Gelliua sp.),<br>

name BMS-192548, which can be prepared by extraction of<br>

described in J. Antibiotics, 1995, 48, 10, 1055-1059,<br>
having the formula (XV)<br><br>
XVII	- Products, in particular extracts obtained by<br>
fermentation of Actinomycetaceae strains, having NPY-<br>
antagonist activity. More particularly, extracts obtained<br>
from a novel strain of actinomycetes having a parti¬<br>
cularly advantageous activity as NPY-receptor antagonists<br>
are particularly preferred NPY-antagonist components.<br>
Fractions with NPY receptor antagonist activity are obtained from the fermentation broths of this strain, by filtration of the supernatant, optionally followed by steps of concentration, purification and/or lyophilization, these fractions being devoid of genotoxi¬city and having a stability which is sufficient to allow them to be formulated in the cosmetic compositions of the present invention.<br>
The supernatant of the fermentation broth can also be used as it is.<br><br>
These novel extracts constitute a subsequent and particularly advantageous aspect of the present inven¬tion.<br>
The organism producing the extracts with NPY receptor antagonist activity according to this specific aspect of the present invention is an actinomycetes strain which has been isolated from a sample of grassland taken from the Haute Garonne (France) , which has been assigned the in-house number SEBR 2794. A sample of this microorganism was deposited on 13 July 1993 at the CNCM of the Pasteur Institute where it was registered under the reference I 1332.<br>
The biochemical characteristics of this micro¬organism were determined on API 50 CH (specific for sugars) , API 50 AO (specific for organic acids) and API 50 AA (specific for amino acids) kits, (marketed by BioMerieux for API 50 CH and by the API Research Labora¬tory for the others) . It was thus determined that this microorganism belongs to the family of Sfcreptomycefcaceae, genua Streptomycaa.<br>
This  is  a  polymorphous,  filamentous  micro¬organism. It grows well at 28°C on an ISP2 culture medium (agar yeast malt extract), the colour of its vegetative mycelium being pinkish-grey.<br>
This organism, which has properties that did not allow it to be identified as a species already described, must be considered as a novel species and it has been designated as Stxaptomycea  ap  SEBR 2794.<br>
The strain Streptomyces ap SEBR 2794, deposited at the CNCM of the Pasteur Institute under the number I 1332, and productive mutants thereof, also constitute a subject of the present invention.<br>
This noval strain was isolated according to the usual method, which consists in placing a small amount of soil in suspension in distilled water, in diluting the suspension to different concentrations and in plating out a small volume of each dilution on the surface of a Petri dish containing » nutrient agar medium. After incubating for a few days at 28°C, which allows the microorganisms<br><br>
to grow, the various colonies are taken separately and subcultured on nutrient agar so as to obtain more abundant cultures therefrom. After culturing on nutrient agar medium and subculturing several times successively, which makes it possible to obtain an abundant and pure culture of the strain of interest, a batch 0 for storage of the parent strain is manufactured, followed by primary and secondary inoculation batches.<br>
For this, a suspension of spores is prepared from a culture on nutrient agar medium in a Petri dish and from maintenance medium; this medium contains a cryo-protective agent making it possible to ensure good viability of the spores during conservation by freezing.<br>
The suspension of spores obtained is divided into cryotubes which will be stored at - 80 °C; these tubes constitute the batch 0.<br>
Following the same procedure, but starting with a tube from batch 0, a primary inoculation batch is prepared.<br>
Next, still according to the same procedure, a secondary inoculation batch is prepared from a cryotube of the primary inoculation batch.<br>
The manufacture of the inoculation batches 0, 1 and 2 ensures long-lasting accessibility of the strain and thus of the desired activity.<br>
The process for preparing the extracts with NPY receptor antagonist activity consists essentially in cultivating the novel strain SEBR 2794, or productive mutants thereof, on a suitable medium and under suitable culture conditions and in then extracting from the fermentation broth the active fraction produced during the culturing; this active fraction is found in the supernatant.<br>
Streptomycma ap SEBR 2794 can be cultured by any aerobic culture method. For this purpose, the various types of apparatus which are in common use in the fermen¬tation industry are used. It is possible, in particular, to adopt the following approach for carrying out the operations.<br><br>
Starting with a tube of the secondary inoculation batch, Petri dishes are seeded and, after incubating for five days, these provided a suspension of spores.<br>
This suspension of spores is used to seed stirred conical flasks containing a suitable medium. The stirred flask can also be seeded directly with a tube of the inoculation batch. The culturing in stirred flasks can last for two to seven days but a duration of three to five days is preferred.<br>
The production of activity is observed in the supernatant, from the first stage and onwards of cultur¬ing in flasks, but it may be advantageous to perform two successive culturing stages: a first stage for propagat¬ing the biomass, a second for production. In the latter case, a duration of one or two days is sufficient for the first stage.<br>
The antagonist activity contained in the flask culture supernatants is expressed as ID50 (50% inhibitory dilution, namely the dilution which inhibits binding of the ligand to its receptors by 50%); the ID50 is generally between 1/200 and 1/1000.<br>
The NPY receptor antagonist activity is obtained in the supernatant of the flask cultures, but it appears to be advantageous, in order to obtain a higher activity, to perform culturing in a fermenter and then to extract the supernatant therefrom. The fermenter is seeded with a one- or two-day-old stirred flask culture. In the fermenter, depending on the culture medium used, the antagonist activity may be observed in the supernatant from the first day onwards, but it is advantageous to prolong the culturing beyond three days in order to obtain an optimal production.<br>
Culturing SEBR 2794 in a fermenter makes it possible to control better the culture conditions which are described below, such as, for example, the pH or the aeration.<br>
The antagonist activity obtained in the fermenter supernatants, before concentrating, may vary, according to the culture conditions applied, between an ID50 of<br><br>
1/500 and an ID50 of 1/10000.<br>
The culture medium used in the fermentation process must contain at least one assimilable carbon source, an assimilable nitrogen source and mineral elements. Assimilable carbon sources which may be used are carbohydrates such as glucose, mannose, maltose, dextrine, glycerol, amino acids and proteins. Assimilable carbon sources which may also be used are acetic? acid, suberic acid, citric acid, propionic acid, succinic acid and 2-ketoglutaric acid or certain animal or plant oils.<br>
Proteins, peptones and amino acids are among the best sources of assimilable nitrogen. These sources comprise, for example, casein, lactalbumin, gluten and hydrolysates thereof, fish meal, yeast extracts and peptones.<br>
The production of biomass may be increased by the addition, during culturing, of one and/or the other of these two main substrates.<br>
Potassium, sodium, iron, magnesium, calcium and manganese salts are among the mineral elements added to the culture medium to ensure growth of the microorganism and to optimize the assimilation of the carbon and nitrogen sources by the cells of the microorganism, as well as phosphorus compounds such as phosphates and trace elements.<br>
To grow the SEBR 2794 source on a medium contain¬ing these components, the process of culturing under aeration and with stirring, in which a liquid medium is used, is advantageous, although culturing on an agar medium can also be used.<br>
The temperature, the duration of incubation, the aeration and the pH of the medium must be such that they give rise to maximum growth of the microorganism used and a maximum yield of extracts with NPY receptor antagonist activity; a culture stirred for about 2 to 7 days is usually advantageous.<br>
The pH of the culture medium is preferably maintained at a more or less neutral or very weakly basic value and the optimum incubation temperature is between<br><br>
about 23°C and 35°C, the preferred range being 25°C to 33°C.<br>
The culture conditions, such as the composition and pH of the medium/ the incubation temperature, the stirring speed and the aeration of the fermentation may vary within a wide range and should obviously be chosen so as to obtain the best possible results.<br>
In order to obtain extracts of the NPY receptor antagonists produced during the culturing, the supernatant is separated from the mycelium after the fermentation broth has or has not been frozen. For this separation, centrifugation, filter-press filtration or clarifying filtration, that is to say filtration in the presence of a filtering adjuvant, or any other technique usually used to extract an extracellular product from a fermentation broth can be used.<br>
The active extract for cosmetic use is prepared from the culture supernatant obtained.<br>
The supernatant may be concentrated by a membrane technique or by any other concentration method so as to facilitate the packaging or the use of the active solution.<br>
It is thus possible to obtain activities with ID50 values ranging from 1/250 to 1/50000.<br>
Whether it has been concentrated or not, the supernatant may be diluted in various solvents which are compatible with cosmetological use.<br>
The extract thus obtained according to this specific aspect of the present invention is filtered through a 0.2 pm filter in order to remove all trace of residual biomass and to ensure microbiological cleanliness: it is then packaged asaptically in sterile bottles and the active solution which can be used in cosmetology is obtained.<br>
Fluids containing the NFY-antagonist extracts of the present invention in a glycol, preferably in propylene glycol, constitute another very advantageous aspect of the present invention. If it is desired to obtain a powder instead of an active solution,  the<br><br>
filtrate can simply be lyophilized.<br>
An assay of NPY receptor antagonist activity carried out on an aliquot makes it possible to evaluate the activity of the active solution and to check the reproducibility of the process.<br>
On the supernatant or the lyophilizate, the extract of the invention may be purified in a more or less thorough manner according to the conventional techniques for purifying "biomolecules", polymers, protein substances or the like, such as, for example, gel permeation chromatography, ultrafiltration, adsorption chromatography, countercurrent chromatography or electro-focalization.<br>
The extracts obtained from this novel strain have a very advantageous NPY receptor antagonist activity. Their strong affinity for these receptors, both for the Yl and Y2 subtypes, has been demonstrated in dog adipo¬cytes, this model displaying great homology with human adipocyte. More particularly, the adipocyte membranes were obtained from omental adipose tissue taken from dogs, essentially used in the technique described by Taouis et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther {1987), 242, 1041-1049. The binding studies were performed according to the known conventional techniques. In particular, the adipocyte membranes (200 jj.g/ml) are incubated for 60 minutes at 30°C in a buffered binding medium (20 mM Krebs-Ringer Hepes solution, pH-7.4, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.25 mg/ml bacitracin) with 0.08 nM of [125I] -NPY labelled with the Bolton-Hunter reagent (Amersham IM 170.2000 Ci/mmol) in the presence or absence of 0.3 /iM pig NPY. The incubation is stopped by filtration using Whatman GF/C filters and the radioactivity retained by the filter is evaluated with a gamma counter.<br>
The non-specific binding, measured in the presence of 0.3 /xH unlabel led NPY, represents 25% of the total binding. The dog adipocyte membrane preparation carries Y1 and Y2 receptors which may be distinguished on the basis of the selective affinity of the NPY fragment (13-36) for the Y2 receptors.<br><br>
The extracts according to the present invention demonstrated good affinity for the NPY receptors of this tissue, by displacing the [125I] -NPY bound to the adipocyte membranes in a dose-dependent manner with IC50 values (that is to say concentrations which inhibit the specific binding of [125I] -NPY by 50%) which depend on the degree of purification of the extracts and which, in the case of the crude extracts obtained directly from the fermentation supernatanta by lyophilization, are at least about 10"2 mg/ml.<br>
The NPY-antagonist nature of the extracts accord¬ing to this specific aspect of the present invention was demonstrated by studies on isolated organs and more particularly in the model of rat "vas deferens", The . extracts showed antagonist properties towards the effects of NPY in Y2 models of rat vas deferens and were studied according to the procedure described in Regulatory Peptides 1986, 13, 307-318.<br>
This activity was confirmed on human adipocytes isolated from subcutaneous adipose tissue, by assaying the release of fatty acids into the culture medium and comparing it with the control (incubation without product).<br>
50% (w/w) solutions of these extracts in propylene glycol are particularly preferred.<br>
The aseptic preparation of these solutions makes It possible to avoid the addition of preserving agent.<br>
In the preparation of the compositions according to the present invention, the extracts with NPY receptor antagonist activity are mixed with aqueous or non-aqueous solvents and with conventional diluents which are compatible with topical use, as well as with the active components of the composition itself. Suitable solvents and/or diluents will be chosen according to their capac¬ity to transport the active component from the extfact of the invention into the subcutaneous adipose layer.<br>
These compositions generally contain excipients or additives chosen from the ingredients usually used in compositions intended for local application according to<br><br>
the need for the specific formulations envisaged.<br>
They may contain, for example, thickeners, softeners, emollients, stabilizers, preserving agents, anti-foaming agents, surfactants, antioxidants, dyes and/or pigments, and fragrances.<br>
They may also contain other active components having either an effect of the same type, for example products which contribute towards controlling lipolysis/ lipogenesis or products which are useful in this type of composition, such as collagen synthesis stimulators, collagenase or elastase inhibitors, and vasoprotectors.<br>
The preferred cosmetic compositions according to the present invention contain, besides the NPY antagonist, an ct2-antagonist which may itself also be a . non-peptide synthetic compound, a peptide or a product obtained by fermentation of a microorganism, for example a bacterium or a fungus, or by extraction of cells or tissues of plant or animal origin.<br>

E. e*2 -Antagonist products obtained by extraction of cells or tissues of animal or plant origin or by fermentation of microorganisms, in particular bacteria and fungi, for example yeasts. Examples of products of this class, also including semisynthetic products, are the products of . groups XXVI and XXVII below.<br>
XXVI	- Extracts of ergot, components and semisynthetic<br>
compounds thereof, having an c*2-antagonist action, in<br>

XXVII	- Products, in particular extracts obtained from<br>
the fermentation of strains of Bacillus lichenifonnis,<br>
with antagonist activity towards the a2 receptor, in<br>
particular from the strain SEBR 2464.<br>
These products, in particular the extracts belonging to this group, represent another specific aspect of the present invention.<br>
The productive organism according to this speci¬fic aspect of the present invention is a strain of Bacillus lichenlformla which has been isolated and has been given the code number SEBR 2464. A sample of this microorganism was deposited on 22 October 1996 at the CNCM of the Pasteur Institute, where it was registered under the reference 1-1778.<br>
The characteristics of this microorganism were determined on API 20B, API 50 CHB, 50 CH, 50 AA, 50AO and 20E API kits.<br>
This is a bacterium in uniformly shaped mobile rod form, from 2 to 10 (no.  in length and from 0.5 to 1 /JM<br><br>
in width, individually or in short chains.<br>
As with most Bacilli, this bacterium is gram+, facultative anaerobic, catalase positive, oxidase nega¬tive and has the characteristic of sporulating under certain conditions.<br>
It grows well at pH 5 to 7, at temperatures between 15 and 55°C and for salinities (MaCl) of up to 7%.<br>
This strain was isolated as a contaminant, during experiments using columns of sand, according to the conventional microbiological techniques known to those skilled in the art.<br>
This particular strain, along with productive mutants thereof, therefore constitutes a further subject of the present invention.<br>
After culturing on nutrient agar medium and subculturing several times successively, which make it possible to obtain an abundant and pure culture of the strain of interest, a batch 0 is manufactured for storage of the parent strain, followed by primary and secondary inoculation batches.<br>
For this, a suspension of spores is prepared from a culture on nutrient agar medium in a Petri dish and from a maintenance medium; this medium contains a cryo-protective agent making it possible to ensure good viability of the spores during storage by freezing.<br>
The suspension of spores obtained is divided into cryotubes which will be stored at -80°C: these tubes constitute batch 0.<br>
Following the same procedure, but starting with a tube from batch 0, a primary inoculation batch is prepared.<br>
Next, still according to the same procedure, a secondary inoculation batch is prepared from a cryotube of the primary inoculation batch.<br>
The manufacture of the inoculation batches 0, 1 and 2 ensures long-lasting accessibility of the strain and thus of the desired activity.<br>
The process for preparing the extracts with<br><br>
or2-receptor antagonist activity consists essentially in growing the novel strain SEBR 2464, or productive mutants thereof, on a suitable medium and under suitable culture conditions and in then extracting the active fraction from in the culture supernatant.<br>
This supernatant may be concentrated until a dry extract is obtained.<br>
The Bacillus lichenlformiB SEBR 2464 can be cultured by any aerobic culture method and in various types of apparatus usually used in the fermentation industry. It is possible, in particular, to adopt the following approach for carrying out the operations.<br>
Starting with a tube of the secondary inoculation batch, Petri dishes are seeded and, after incubating for . two days, these allow stirred conical flasks containing a suitable medium to be inoculated.<br>
A stirred flask can also be seeded directly with a tube of the inoculation batch. In this case, the duration of culturing will be longer for the same medium.<br>
The antagonist activity is obtained in the flask cultures within 10 hours to 48 hours depending on the culture conditions used.<br>
The a2-receptor antagonist activity is extracted from the culture supernatants. The activity of the extracts is expressed as ID50 (50% inhibitory dilution); one litre of culture makes it possible to obtain 10 ml of extract having an ID50 value of between 1/2500 and 1/10,000.<br>
The a2-receptor antagonist activity may be obtained by extracting the supernatant of the flask cultures, but it appears to be advantageous, in order to obtain a higher activity, to perform culturing in a fermenter and then to extract the supernatant therefrom.<br>
The fermenter is seeded with a 1- to 2-day-old culture in a stirred flask; it is preferable for the culture not to have begun to sporulate.<br>
In the fermenter, according to the culture conditions used, the antagonist activity may be observed from the first hours of culturing and onwards, but it is<br><br>
advantageous to wait until the stationary growth phase has been reached before extracting.<br>
Culturing SEBR 2464 in a fermenter allows better control of the culture conditions which are described below, for example the pH and the aeration.<br>
The a2-receptor antagonist activity obtained in the fermenter may vary, depending on the culuture condi¬tions applied.<br>
One litre of culture makes it possible to obtain from the supernatant, after extraction, 10 ml of extract having an ID50 of between 1/3000 and 1/15,000.<br>
The characteristics of the medium are identical to those described above for the strain SEBR 2794.<br>
In order to grow the strain SEBR 2464 on a medium containing these components, the process of culturing under aeration and with stirring, in which a liquid medium is used, is advantageous, although culturing on an agar medium can also be used.<br>
The temperature, the duration of incubation, the aeration and the pH of the medium must be such that they give rise to a maximum growth of the microorganism used and a maximum yield of extract with a2-receptor antagon¬ist activity.<br>
A culture stirred and aerated for about 10 hours to 48 hours is usually advantageous.<br>
The pH of the culture medium is preferably maintained at a more or less neutral or very weakly acidic value and the optimum incubation temperature is between 25°C and 50°C.<br>
The culture conditions, such as the composition and pH of the medium, the incubation temperature, the stirring speed and the aeration of the fermentation, may vary within a wide range and should obviously be chosen so as to obtain the best possible results.<br>
The production of an extract having a high a2-receptor antagonist activity requires several extraction steps.<br>
A first step consists in eliminating the biomass. For this,  centrifugation,  tangential microfiltration,<br><br>
clarifying filtration, that is to say a filtration in the presence of a filtering adjuvant, or any other method usually used to extract an extracellular product from a fermentation broth may be used. The supernatant is then placed in contact overnight with a hydrophobic resin preferably made of polystyrene-divinylbenzene, for example such as Amberlite XAD2 resin (Rohm &amp; Haas) or CHP20P resin (Mitsubishi).<br>
The loaded resin is then separated by frontal filtration and the filtrate is removed.<br>
The resin undergoes several successive extrac¬tions with different solvents, allowing molecules of a hydrophobic nature to be extracted. After each extrac¬tion, the resin is separated from the organic phase by filtration.<br>
The various organic phases are then evaporated under vacuum, together or separately, until one or more dry extracts are obtained.<br>
An assay of ot2-receptor antagonist activity performed on an aliquot of each of the extracts makes it possible to evaluate their activity and to check the reproducibility of the process.<br>
The dry extract thus obtained may be taken up in various solvents usually used in cosmetology.<br>
The uptake concentration is chosen to allow complete dissolution of the extract and to be compatible with the subsequent use. In order to eliminate all trace of residual bioxnass and to ensure its microbiological stability, the extract is filtered on a 0.2 p filter and divided aseptically into sterile flasks.<br>
The a2-antagonist activity of the extracts was evaluated using the technique described by Chapleo CB et al., J. Med. Chem., 1983, 26, 823-831, on the in vitro displacement, in rat cortex, of the o2-receptor antagon¬ist reference ligandt tritiated idazoxan.<br>
The a2 -antagonist extract, containing 30% dry extract, is introduced into a 50/50 propylene glycol/water mixture and makes a preferred dilution according to the invention.<br><br>
Dilutions for aseptic preparation of these solutions, which makes it possible to avoid the addition of preserving agent, may also be used.<br>
In the preparation of the compositions according to the present invention, the extracts thus made up with Qf2-receptor antagonist activity are mixed with aqueous or non-aqueous solvents and with conventional diluents which are compatible with a topical use, as well as with the active components of the composition itself. Suitable solvents and/or diluents will be chosen according to their capacity to transport the active component from the extract of the invention into the subcutaneous adipose layer.<br>
These compositions generally contain excipients or additives chosen from the ingredients usually used in compositions intended for a local application, according to the need for the specific formulations envisaged.<br>
They may contain, for example, thickeners, softeners, emollients, stabilizers, preserving agents, anti-foaming agents, surfactants, antioxidants, dyes and/or pigments, and fragrances.<br>
They may also contain other active components having either an effect of the same type, for example products which contribute towards regulating lipolysis/lipogenesis, or products which are useful in this standard type of composition, such as collagen synthesis stimulators, collagenase or elastase inhibitors, or vasoprotectors.<br>
The a2-antagonist extracts of the invention moreover proved to be completely devoid of genotoxicity in the Ames test and the test of PNA repair. Their stability is compatible with their use in cosmetic compositions.<br>
The cosmetic compositions of the present inven¬tion contain the NPY antagonist in percentages of between 0.00001% to 5% relative to the total weight of the composition, mixed with the excipients commonly used to prepare cosmetic formulations to be applied to the skin.<br>
The said percentages may vary within the range<br><br>
indicated above as a function, of the intrinsic activity of the NPY-antagoniet component included in the composi¬tion. Preferably, the said NPY-antagonist component is present in percentages of from 0.0001% to 2%.<br>
The NPY-antagonist component is advantageously chosen from the products included in classes A, B and C above, those of class C being particularly advantageous. The components belonging to groups XV, XVI and XVII are preferred.<br>
In the preparation of the compositions according to the present invention, the NPY-antagonist component is mixed with aqueous or non-aqueous solvents and with conventional diluents which are compatible with use on the skin, as well as with other components of the compo¬sition itself. Suitable solvents and/or diluents will be chosen according to their capacity to deposit the NPY-antagonist active component of the invention onto the skin.<br>
These compositions generally contain excipients or additives selectedfrom the ingredients usually used in compositions intended for a local application according to the need for the specific formulations envisaged.<br>
They may contain, for example, thickeners, softeners, emollients, stabilizers, preserving agents, anti-foaming agents, surfactants, antioxidants, dyes and/or pigments, and fragrances.<br>
When the NPY-antagonist component is an extract of cells or tissues of animal or plant origin or a product, in particular an extract, obtained by fermenta¬tion of a microorganism, for example a bacterium or a fungus, the amount of NPY-antagonist component is always from 0.00001% to 5%, preferably from 0.0001 to 2%, relative to the total weight of the composition, the said amount being calculated relative to the weight of the dry extract.<br>
The compositions according to the present inven¬tion comprise, according to a preferred aspect, an extract obtained by fermentation of the novel strain SEBR 2794 in proportions, on a weight/weight percentage basis,<br><br>
which depend on the degree of NPY receptor antagonist activity of the extract used and therefore on the concen¬tration of dry substance and on the specific activity of this substance.<br>
The higher the antagonist activity of the extract used towards the NPY receptors, the lower is the weight amount required to obtain the desired lipolytic effect, and vice versa.<br>
In order to obtain the cosmetic compositions according to the invention, the crude extracts (supernat-ants filtered through a 0.2 p filter) obtained directly from the fermentation may conveniently be used without any purification step, in proportions of between 0.00001 and 5%, advantageously from 0.0001 to 2%, better still from 0.01 to 2% by weight and preferably from 0.1 to 2% by weight. These weight percentages are, naturally, calculated on the basis of the weight of extract pre¬pared.<br>
When the compositions of the present invention also contain, in addition to the NPY-antagonist component, an a2-antagonist component, the latter is present in a percentage of from 0.00001 to 5%, advantage¬ously from 0.0001 to 2%, better still from 0.001 to 1% and preferably from 0.01 to 0.5%, relative to the total weight of the composition.<br>
The said percentages may vary within the ranges indicated above as a function of the intrinsic activity of the «2-antagonist component included in the composi¬tion.<br>
The a2-antagonist component is advantageously chosen from the products included in classes D and E above, those of class E being particularly advantageous. The compounds belonging to group XXVII are preferred.<br>
When the t*2 -antagonist component is an extract of cells or tissues of animal or plant origin or a product obtained by fermentation of a microorganism, for example a bacterium or a fungus, the amount of a2-antagonist component is that indicated above, the said amount being calculated on the basis of the weight of the dry extract.<br><br>
jiccgroing co an advantageous aspect of the present invention, the cosmetic composition contains both an NPY-antagonist component and an c*2 -antagonist compo¬nent, the NPY-antagonist component being selected from those of classes A, B and C above and the a2-antagonist component being selected from those of classes D and E above.<br>
According to a particularly advantageous aspect, the cosmetic composition of the present invention, con¬tains an NPY-antagonist component selected from those belonging to class C, in particular to groups XV, XVI and XVII and an a2-antagonist component selected from those belonging to class E, in particular to group XXVII.<br>
According to a preferred aspect, the present invention relates to a cosmetic composition containing an NPY-antagonist component consisting of an extract selected from those of group XVII above and an a2-antagonist component consisting of an extract selected from those of group XXVII above.<br>
More particularly, the composition according to this preferred aspect of the present invention contains an NPY-antagonist component which may be obtained by fermentation of the strain Streptomyces sp. SEBR 2794 deposited at the CNCM of the Pasteur Institute under the number I 1132, or productive mutants thereof, and an a2-antagonist component which can be obtained by fermentation of the strain Bacillus licheniformis SEBR 2464 filed at the CNCM of the Pasteur Institute under the number 1-1778, with excipients normally used for formulations of this type, such as those mentioned above.<br>
The form of the compositions according to the present invention may be an emulsion in which the consti¬tuent or the mixture of constituents, with an optional stabilizer, is combined with excipients which are com¬monly used in cosmetic compositions and which are compat¬ible with the said constituents, such as lanolin or plant/ mineral or synthetic oils.<br>
The compositions of the invention may also be in the form of a gel in suitable excipients,  such as<br><br>
cellulose esters or other gelling agenta such aa acrylic derivatives and may contain the active principle in dissolved form or suspended as microgranulea.<br>
The compositions according to the invention may also take the form of a lotion or a solution in which the mixture of constituents is dissolved or microdispersed.<br>
The form of the compositions according to the invention may thus be a microdispersion in a liquid containing water as well as one or more compatible surfactants. The disparsions have microemulsion prop¬erties and have virtually the appearance of true solutions. They may also be prepared at the time of use.<br>
An advantageous form of the compositions accord¬ing to the invention is a fluid applied topically via an adhesive support, referred to hereinbelow as a "patch", this patch allowing controlled diffusion of the active components, this diffusion possibly being activated by physical phenomena such as electrical microcurrents.<br>
The cosmetic compositions of the present inven¬tion may also contain other active components having either an effect of the same type as that of the NPY antagonists, for example products which contribute towards controlling lipolysis/lipogenesis, or collagen synthesis stimulators, collagenase or elastase inhibitors, or vasoprotectors.<br>
The compositions of the present invention are of good stability and may be stored for the time required for use at temperatures of between 0*C and 60°C without any sedimentation of the constituents or separation of the phases talcing place, and also without their being any decrease in activity which might compromise the use of these compositions.<br>
These compositions are very well tolerated, they have no phototoxicity and their application to the skin for prolonged periods involves no side effects.<br>
The compositions of the present invention, in their various forms of presentation, may be used as lipolysis/lipogenesis regulators in the skin. More particularly, they can be used as cosmetic products for<br><br>
slimming or seborrhoeia-regulating use or as adjuvants in the treatment of acne.<br>
The cosmetic compositions of the present inven¬tion may be placed in contact with the epidermis or the ,  hair or pilous system so as to modify the appearance thereof and afford protection thereto.<br>
For example, when these compositions are placed in contact with the epidermis, the latter takes on a "healthy" appearance as if it had been exposed to the air and/or the sun, without, however, tanning, if this is not desired. More particularly, the cosmetic compositions of the present invention make the skin lose its "fatty*1 appearance with the result of slimming that part of the body with which the said composition is placed in contact and of keeping it in good condition. Prom the first applications and onwards, the skin relief is smooth and the skin becomes firmer with better tonus. After applica¬tion for one month, the slimming effect appears, the "orange peel" appearance is visibly attenuated and the figure becomes shaplier.<br>
when the compositions of the present invention are placed in contact with the hair or pilous system, for example after a specific anti-seborrhoeia treatment, the said system is maintained in good condition.<br>
Similarly, the compositions of the present invention kaep the facial skin is good condition, also making the formation of comedones more difficult.<br>
A slimming fluid obtained according to Example 12 below was tested on 50 female volunteers who used the said fluid applied twice a day onto the thighs, with very good results.<br>
The slimming fluid described in Example 13 below was tested in a study including 150 female volunteers, carried out under double-blind conditions against placebo. The analysis and comparison of the results obtained with this slimming fluid and with its placebo under the experimental conditions adopted, which are similar to the normal conditions of use for repeated applications over 60 consecutive days on both thighs and<br><br>
the abdomen from the waist to the knees, made it possible to demonstrate a clear and statistically significant slimming effect in favour of the slimming fluid according to the invention relative to the placebo.<br>
The efficacy and tolerance of a slimming fluid as described in Example 14 was tested on more than 1000 women. These tests showed a decrease in the thickness of the adipose tissue, a tonifying and firming action and a slimming effect demonstrated by centimetric echographic measurement and by biphotonic absorptiometry.<br>
One object of the invention is also a cosmetic<br>
treatment method,      wherein	an amount of an<br>
NPY antagonist with a cosmetic effect and optionally an amount of an a2-antagonist with a cosmetic effect in a vehicle for cosmetic use is applied to the epidermis and/or the hair or pilous system.<br>
Lastly, the subject of the present invention is the use of an NPY antagonist for the preparation of cosmetic compositions intended to control lipolysis/lipogenesis in the skin, in particular for slimming and seborrhoeia-regulating purposes and as an adjuvant in or after the treatment of acne.<br>
More particularly, the invention relates to the use of an NPY antagonist for the manufacture of cosmetic compositions intended to maintain the facial skin in good condition by making the formation of comedones difficult.<br>
The invention also relates to the use of an NPY antagonist for the manufacture of cosmetic compositions intended for placing in contact with the hair or pilous system. In particular, the invention relates to the use of an NPY antagonist for the manufacture of cosmetic compositions intended to control lipolysis/lipogenesis of the skin, the said compositions also containing an a.2-antagonist component.<br>
The examples which follow illustrate the inven¬tion without, however, limiting it.<br>

€<br>
strain Streptomyces  sp  SEBR 2794 <cf. xvii above></cf.>
1.1 Fermentation<br>
The strain Streptomyces sp   SEBR 2794 was fer¬mented in six different culture media.<br><br><br><br>
1.1.2.<br>
(a)	A suspension of spores from the strain SEBR 2794 is<br>
prepared according to the method indicated in 1.1.1. (a)<br>
and<br>

The fermentation broth is centrifuged at 13,000 revolutions/minute (27,500 g) for 20 minutes and is filtered in the presence of 15 g of filtering adjuvant on a filter press. The filtrate obtained is lyophilised<br><br>
directly and the dry residue thus obtained (16.3 g) is redissolved in 80 ml of water (final pH = 8.4).<br>
The 50% inhibitory dilution of this fraction (ID50) is 1/4500.<br>
1.2.2.	The extraction is performed on 10 1 of culture<br>
broth obtained by working according to Example 1.1.5. and<br>
are frozen beforehand.<br>
The broth is centrifuged in 500 ml buckets at 8000 rpm (11,000 g) for 20 min. 9 1 of completely clear supernatant are obtained.<br>

The process is performed by ultrafiltration of the solution of Example 1.2.1. using an Ami con 5000 membrane in a stirring cell in 25 mH phosphate buffer pH = 7.5 containing 150 mM NaCl and an active retentate and a totally inactive permeate are obtained.<br>
1.3.2.	Concentration on a 10 kD membrane<br>
A 10 kD Ami con membrane is used to concentrate the 9 litres of supernatant obtained in Example 2.2. By<br><br>
concentrating by a factor of 5, 1.8 1 of concentrate five times more active (ID5fl ■ 1/10,000) and a totally inac¬tive permeate are obtained.<br>
1.3.3. Concentration on a 30 kD membrane<br>
A 30 kD Ami con membrane is used to concentrate the 8.5 1 of filtrate obtained in Example 2.3. By concen¬trating by a factor of 5, 1.7 1 of concentrate which is up to five times more active (ID50 &gt; 1/10,000} and a permeate containing very weak activity {20% inhibition at 1/250) are obtained.<br>
1.4. Purification<br>
1.4.1.	Gel permeation chromatography<br>
The samples of the solution from 1.2.1. are subjected to gel permeation chromatographies using various gels: Sephadex G 25, G 50, G 75 and G 100 and the results indicated below are obtained:<br>
the activity is eluted at the exclusion volume on Sephadex G 25 and G 50 and very close to the exclusion volume of G 75.<br>
On Sephadex G 100 gel, the activity may be separated from the products of higher molecular weight (&gt; 100 KD).<br>
On a Superose 12 analytical column (1 KD to 100 KD fractionation domain), the active molecule showed a retention time of between that of ovalbumin (44 KD) and that of cytochrome (14.4 KD).<br>
1.4.2.	Ultrafiltration on a membrane with a cut-off<br>
threshold of 5000 daltons<br>
100 ml of a culture supernatant (ID50 - 1/3600) are dialysed in 5 volumes of 20 mH phosphate buffer pH 7.4,  150 mH HaCl,  in a magnetically-stirred cell equipped with an Amicon 5000 membrane, and pressurized with compressed air to a pressure of 1 x 10s Pa (1 bar).<br>
100 ml of retentate (ID50 1/2500) freed of mol¬ecules of low molecular weight and 500 ml of an ultra-<br><br>
filtrate of negligible activity are recovered.<br>
1.4.3.	Ultrafiltration on a membrane with a cut-off<br>
threshold of 10,000 daltons<br>
100 ml of a culture supernatant (ID50 1/3600) are dialysed in 7 volumes of 20 mH phosphate buffer pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl in a magnetically-stirred cell pressurized to<br>
1	x 10s Pa (1 bar) with compressed air and fitted with a<br>
Filtron 10K membrane.<br>
100 ml of retentate having an ID50 activity * 1/1500 in terms of inhibition of binding to the NPY receptor are recovered*<br>
The ultrafiltrate (700 ml) is reconcentrated in a cell of the same type fitted with an Ami con 1000 . membrane.<br>
100 ml of solution having an ID50 value of 1/500 are obtained.<br>
1.4.4.	Removal of the hydrophobic impurities<br>
1500 ml of a culture supernatant are treated for<br>
2	hours, with stirring, with 180 g of polystyrene-<br>
divinylbenzene resin (XAD2). The resin is then filtered<br>
and washed with twice 300 ml of methanol and then with<br>
300 ml of acetone. The combined methanol and acetone<br>
solutions are evaporated under vacuum. The residue taken<br>
up in 40 ml of methanol gives a solution which has no<br>
activity.<br>
The aqueous solution freed of the hydrophobic products is lyophilized.<br>
The residue taken up in 80 ml of water gives a solution having an ID50 value of 1/4500 in terms of inhibition of binding to the NFY receptor.<br>
1.4.5.	Extraction of the active molecule by cation<br>
exchange.<br>
1500 ml of a culture supernatant are adjusted to pH 5 with 1 N acetic acid and are then treated with 120 g of cation exchange resin (Dowex 50 WX-4, ACO form).<br>
After stirring  for one hour,  the  resin  is<br><br>
filtered and then de a orbed with 300 ml of IN aqueous ammonia for half an hour. This solution is then lyophilized. The residue obtained taken up in 40 ml of water gives a solution which, when measured in terms of inhibition of binding to the NPY receptor, has an ID50 value of 1/3S00.<br>
Solutions with NPY receptor antagonist activity may also be obtained by extracting the culture broths of Examples 1.1.2, 1.1.3, 1.1.4 and 1.1.6 according to the extraction examples described in 1.2.1 to 1.2.3.<br>

2.2. Extraction<br>
2.2.1. Tha extraction is performed on 12 1 of culture broth of 2.1.1.<br>
The broth is centrifuged at 13,000 revolu¬tions/minute (27,500 g) for 10 min and 11 1 of supernatant are obtained. 2.1 kg of Amberlite XAD2 resin preconditioned with methanol and acetone are added to these 11 1 of supernatant.<br>
The supernatant/resin mixture is placed together overnight at room temperature.<br>
The resin is then filtered off and the products<br><br>
bound thereto are successively eluted with twice 5 litres of methanol and with 5 litres of acetone.<br>
The organic phases are combined after filtration and evaporated to dryness under vacuum.<br>
The evaporation residue (46 g) constitutes the dry extract; it is redissolved in 100 ml of propylene glycol/water mixture (50/50).<br>
