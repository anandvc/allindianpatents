				<td>TITLE: A TECHNOLOGY FOR ETHANOL FROM BANANA PSEUDOSTEM<br>
WASTE <br>
<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
<br>
The present application claims priority to Indian Provisional Patent Application<br>
No. 387/CHE/2010, filed Feb. 15, 2010, which is incorporated by reference<br>
herein.<br>
<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
<br>
The invention relates ethanol  production,  more specifically method for the<br>
production of ethanol from wasted banana pseudostem which is the finest source<br>
of cellulose and hemicellulose using yeast under anaerobic condition.<br>
<br>
BACKROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
<br>
Ethanol has been known for a long time, perhaps the oldest product obtained<br>
through traditional biotechnology. Conventionally, ethanol containing beverages<br>
are used for human consumption. It is also used as the main ingredient in<br>
medical wipes as antibacterial and antiseptics, antifreeze agent, an antidote for<br>
methanol   poisoning,   disinfectants,   extractant,   hand   sanitizer  gels,   in  the<br>
manufacture of varnishes and perfumes, preservative for biological specimens,<br>
sketch art markers, flavorings and medicines. The demand for ethanol has been<br>
increasing day by day because of its multiple uses. Currently, commercial<br>
ethanol production relies on the fermentation of sucrose from cane sugar and<br>
molasses or glucose derived from starch based crops such as corn, wheat and<br>
cassava. There is a growing need for the industry to improve technology and<br>
 enhance production due to high oil prices, environmental pressures and national security concerns.<br>
<br>
The global production of plant biomass, of which over 90% is lignocellulose, amounts to about 200X109 tonnes per year, whereas 8-20X109 tonnes of the primary biomass remains potentially inaccessible. Lignocellulose is the major structural component of woody plants and non-woody plants such as grass and represents a major source of the renewable organic matter. Plants consisting of lignocellulose can be divided into three categories according to plant taxonomy: softwood (gymnosperms), hardwood (woody angiosperms) and annual plants (herbaceous angiosperms). Lignocellulosic materials are the most appealing in this respect, due to their abundance and low cost.<br>
<br>
Banana is the most widely grown fruit crop in more than 132 countries including India, covering almost 10 million hectares of cropped area. Uma et al., Banana Fibre, (2003), Niseema printers, Cochin and Sharma et al., Ind. J. Microbiol, 47, (2007), 310-316 disclosed that India on an average produces 1.533*107 MT banana / year with 24% of world's bananas production. Zuluaga and co-workers disclosed the cultivation of banana generates a considerable amount of residues, where the fruit constitutes 12 wt% of the plant, and the remaining parts become agricultural waste. Tamil Nadu Government disclosed that banana is cultivated in and around 94 thousand hectares in 14 districts of Tamil Nadu, India (2008) and the estimated production of banana is 4.488* 106 tonnes in the year 2007-2008. Baig er al., African Journal of Biotechnology, 3, (2004), 447-450 and Khalil et al., Bioresources, 1, (2006), 220-232 disclosed that the remaining part of the plant includes leaves, stem and rhizome and after harvesting the fruit left in the field takes several months for degradation. Apart from its multifaceted uses like therapeutics, dye, starch extraction and other innumerable uses, it forms the finest source of cellulose.<br>
<br>
Very few reports have been accounted on alcohol production form banana pseudostem. Baig and oo workers, African Journal of Biotechnology, 3, (2004), 447-450 disclosed the sugar production from dried leaves and psuedostem using cellulase produced by Trichoderma lignorum. They disclosed 1.34 mg/ml of reducing sugars from steam treated the agro-waste after 24 h. They also disclosed the size of substrates, pH and temperature to impact the yield. Saeed and Qazi, Mycopath, 3, (2005), 73-78 disclosed the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation of banana by using Issatchenkia orientalis and reported 4.14 % ethanol yield in a single step process. In another report, Shafique and co-worker International Journal of Agriculture and Biology, 6, (2004), 488-491 disclosed the exoglucanase production using Bacillus subtilis on solid-state fermentation (SSF) from banana stalk. They also disclosed maximum exoglucanase activity (3.48 lU/mL/min) from the medium fermented with 70% moisture content, 5 mL inoculum, 0.1% peptone, 0.4% yeast extract and 0.2% Tween-80 at pH 7 and temperature 35 Â°C. A strong need exists for efficient ethanol production with cost effective raw material and energy consumption.<br>
 <br>
Therefore it is an embodiment of the present invention is to provide a technology<br>
for producing ethanol from lignocellulosic waste, particularly banana pseudostem<br>
waste.<br>
<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is to offer a technology for<br>
producing ethanol from banana pseudostem waste using dilute oxalic acid to<br>
convert lignocellulose into fermentable sugars, which is then fermented with<br>
reference strain and ethanol tolerant yeast to produce ethanol.<br>
<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is to identify the effect of nitrogen<br>
source like urea in the fermentation process and ethanol production.<br>
<br>
Yet another embodiment of the present invention is to offer an industrially viable,<br>
less energy utilizing and inexpensive technology for producing ethanol from<br>
banana pseudostem waste.<br>
<br>
Still another embodiment of the present invention is to provide a method for<br>
producing ethanol from banana pseudostem wherein the said method consumes<br>
very less energy during conversion of sugars.<br>
<br>

<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
<br>
Acid hydrolysis of banana pseudostem waste<br>
Incubation at varying conditions<br>
<br>
The lignocellulosic feedstock optionally milled was used for further studies. One<br>
part of lignocellulosic waste treated with 5-10 parts of mild mineral acid at<br>
different  concentrations  (1   -  25)  under  pressurized  (15  lb)  at  different<br>
temperature (80 - 130 degree C) for 5-150 minutes of residence time. The<br>
hydrolysate optionally separated by used centrifugation force at 10,000 rpm for 5<br>
- 20 min. The hydrolysate was neutralized with alkali and determined for sugars.<br>
<br>
The most important results of the hydrolysis were summarized in Figure 1.<br>
<br>
The results indicate that the sugar production was regularly increased from initial<br>
residence time and above but initiation of maximum sugar release occurred in 8<br>
concentration   mild   mineral   acid   and   it   reduced   dramatically   in   all   other concentrations of C2H2O4. Since maximum initiation of sugar release has occurred in even mild mineral acid at diluted concentrations of C2H2O4, and it was also recommended that use of dilute acid for pretreatment would not have any post production problems in the form of acid disposal.<br>
<br>
The hydrolysate product was collected by centrifugation force, neutralized with alkali and estimated for total and reducing sugars. The resulting hydrolyzed fractions from dry milled lignocellulosic waste are then subjected to fermentation as described below. The hydrolyzed product was found to be maximum 53.5 percentages. The hydrolyzed aqueous material was fermented by both reference strain and isolated yeast under anaerobic condition.<br>

 <br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
<br>
Seed culture and inoculum preparation<br>
<br>
Yeast     strains     Saccharomyces     cerevisiae     (MTCC     170)     and Issatchenkia orientalis (MTCC 10641) were used for the present invention. Seed cultures were prepared by inoculating a large single colony into liquid glucose yeast extract malt medium under agitation (125 rpm) at 30 Â± 2 degree C for 18 h. Preparation of acid hydrolysates 100 parts of lignocellulosic feedstock was used for the preparation of hydrolysates. 8 concentrations of oxalic acid and banana pseudostem were mixed and the substrate mixtures were hydrolysed under pressurized temperature at 80-130 degree C and 15 lb pressure with a residence time of 5-150 min. The hydrolysates were filtered using a nylon filter and neutralized to pH 5.0-5.5 with sodium hydroxide. The amount of fermentable sugars produced during hydrolyses of substrates were estimated.<br>
<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
<br>
Ethanol Production from hydrolyzed lignocellulosic feedstocks of banana<br>
pseudostem waste<br>
<br>
The resulted hydrolysate was taken in a pre-sterilized container. 10 parts of the mother culture was inoculated and fermented, at 25 - 32 degree C 240 hrs. The sample was taken to analyze the production of ethanol.<br>
<br>
In the technology, the ethanol production was preceded by treating the samples with optimized concentrations of mild mineral acid. Two different reference and isolate yeast strains were used as fermenting microorganisms for conversion of lignocellulosic feedstock hydrolyzed product to ethanol. The final ethanol yield from separate hydrolysis and fermentation 18.65g / 100g (w/w) of lignocellulosic feedstock at solid basis and with urea supplementation 22.77g / 100g (w/w) of lignocellulosic feedstock at solid basis. <br>
<br>
Ethanol fermentation efficiencies were between 69.72 percentage and 84.67 percentage.<br>
<br>
In this present invention, lignocellulosic based ethanol production was invented to decide the various parameters essential for maximum ethanol recovery. The time for maximum ethanol production was also reduced in urea supplementation from 168 hrs to 72 hrs in banana pseudostem hydrolysate in SHF. EXAMPLE 3<br>
<br>
In the present invention, the pH of the urea supplement fermented aqueous material was found to regularly reduce from 5.0 to 4.5 in both the hydrolysates with and without urea supplementation. The yeast growth also regularly increased initially and decreased in the later part of the process. The yeast cell number was high (42 log 5) in urea supplemented fermented broth (Figure. 2). From the results, it can be concluded that urea supplemented broth supports the growth of yeast cells and their fermentation ability.<br>
<br>
In the present invention the dry milled banana pseudostem samples were used for ethanol production. The first step was the hydrolysis of the banana pseudostem to release maximum amount of sugars. This was done using physical, chemical and thermal reactions in the occurrence of dilute oxalic acid.<br>
 <br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
<br>
To evaluate the competence of the isolate used in this invention, the aqueous material after hydrolysis were concurrently fermented using Saccharomyces cerevisiae (MTCC 170) a reference strain procured from Microbial Type Culture Collection, Institute of Microbial Technology, Chandigarh, India. The ethanol yield from banana pseudostem hydrolysate was 22.65g / 100g (Figure. 3). Maximum ethanol production was noticed on day 2 in banana pseudostem hydrolysate. The ethanol yield was comparably equal in the native isolate, /. orientalis (MTCC 10641) based fermentation of S. cerevisiae (MTCC 170) based fermentation. The pH was found to regularly reduce from 5.1 to 4.65 in the fermented broth. Though there was no drastic reduction in the pH of the fermented aqueous material, a gradual drop in the same was observed over a period of incubation. The yeast cell number was maximum (14.9 log 5) in the same (Figure. 3A).<br>
