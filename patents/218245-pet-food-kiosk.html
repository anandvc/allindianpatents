				<td>PET FOOD KIOSK<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] This invention relates generally to methods for marketing pet foods, and more particularly, to an apparatus configured to the manufacture of a pet food customized to the health and nutrition requirements of an individual pet<br>
[0002] Retail pet food manufacturers typically manufacture their pet foods in large quantities and in only a limited number of formulations. Most manufacturers offer, for example, dog food in several flavors, and in a puppy formula, an adult dog formula, and a mature or inactive dog formula. Some manufacturers offer breed-specific or size-specific formulas, In addition, some manufacturers offer more specialized formulas for dogs having specific food allergies or nutrient responsive diseases. Similarly, retail cat food is typically offered m a limited variety of formulas having different flavors or for different stages of development However, all of the above described food selections are for a totally pre-made product and hence the range of pet food choices is not necessarily compatible with the highly variable preferences and dietary requirements of individual pets. Thus, making a selection to suit a particular pet's dietary needs is sometimes difficult and sub-optimal. For example, an individual pet may have specific dietary requirements because of an existing illness or disease; or because of a genetic predisposition towards a particular ' disease. Further, the existing variety of pet food choices typically available at, for example, retail outlets, makes it difficult for pet owners to choose the food which most closely meets their own pet's nutrient needs. In addition, once a food is chosen, knowing how to feed the food correctly can be difficult<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In one aspect, a kiosk is provided which is configured for selling and manufacturing a customized food for a pet The kiosk comprises a customer interface area, a biological sample analysis and handling area, a base product display area, a<br>
product additive storage area, and an ingredient mixing and customer observation area.<br>
In another aspect, a method is provided for marketing a customized food product for a pet using a kiosk, where the kiosk includes at least one of a consumer interaction station, an analysis station, and a workstation. The method comprises providing a questionnaire at the consumer interaction station to profile the pets, performing an analysis of a biological sample for a pet at the analysis workstation, determining a customized pet food product based on the questionnaire answers and the biological sample, and preparing a sample of the customized product for the consumer at the workstation.<br>

[0009] m one embodiment, consumer interaction station 22 includes a computer 42 for storing custom pet product groupings for one or more pets analyzed, where the consumer can return to kiosk 10 to quickly purchase additional supplies of the pet product in either a completed form, or alternatively, the consumer purchases the product additives, dry or liquid, for adding to a base product which can be purchased elsewhere,<br>
[0010] Figure 2 is a diagram of one embodiment of workstation 26. Components of workstation 26, identical to those components shown in Figure 1, are identified in Figure 2 using the same reference numerate as used in Figure 1. Referring specifically to Figure 2, workstation 26 includes wire shelving 28 for storage, a steel shelf 32 used as a work surface, and drawers 52 for storage of supplies used by the kiosk operator (not shown). Stocked on wire shelves 28 are bags of base formula food (kibble) 54 and other dry ingredients 56. hi one embodinient,fhere are multiple varieties of base formula foods 54, and the variety used in developing a customized food for a particular pet is based upon the pet's needs, as further described in an example below. Further stocked on shelves 28 are empty bottles 58 used to provide additives to customers, measuring spoons 60 and measuring cups 62 which are provided to customers as part of the customized pet food purchase or sold separately.<br>
[0011]   As the kiosk operator prepares customized food for a pet, which is placed in bottle 58 for presentment to a customer, the operator prepares a<br>
customized additive for the particular pet using at least (me of packets 64 of dry additive or one of a variety of liquid additives stored in dispensers 66. Other dry ingredients 56 include at least one of base formula foods 54, extra bottles 58, packets 64, spoons 60 and cups 62 stored in bulk. As described in further detail below, the kiosk operator prepares a custom additive, using at least one of packets 64 and liquids in dispensers 66 to be stored in bottle 58 and presented to the customer, fa one embodiment, the dry ingredients in packets 64 and the liquids in dispensers 66 include multiple, different varieties for preparing unique customized additives to be added to<br>
One of base formula kilosk<br>
[0012]   Figure 3 illustrates a method 100 of obtaining a customized pet food product utilizing kiosk 10 (shown in Figure 1).    m m exemplary<br>
embodiment, a pet  owner (cunsumer) that is first-time purchase of a customized pet<br>
food product approaches 102 pet food, product kiosk 10, or boom, located in a retail • location, including but not limited to, a mall, a store, a veterinarian office, a clinic, an airport, and an outdoor event In other embodiments, customer interest is solicited through any one of direct mail, electronic mail, brochures and telephone. The consumer supplies 104 a biological sample (i.e., stool sample) and completes a questionnaire, typically at customer interaction station 22 (shown in Figure 1) of kiosk 10. The questionnaire is provided in advance of the visit on the Internet, in the mail, or personally picked up and answered at kiosk 10. The questionnaire profiles the pet. m an alternative embodiment, customer interest is solicited by supplying a customer with a bag to contain a biological sample for analysis at kiosk 10 using a direct mail campaign.<br>
[0013] m one embodiment, analytical data is obtained from the biological sample by a veterinarian/technician located on site, for example at biological sample and analysis and handling area 14 (shown in Figure 1). m an alternative embodiment, the sample is sent to a central lab for analysis. The analysis is performed on (he biological sample with respect to examining several health and digestive indicators. Data from the biological sample analysis is combined 106 with the pet profile information and entered into a system, for example, computer 42<br>
(shown in Figure 1), including a pet food product customization model. Alternatively, the biological sample analysis is forwarded by the pet's veterinarian to the kiosk operator and the results are incorporated into the pet profile.<br>
[0014] The system processes 108 the data utilizing at leait one algorithm and generates a pet profile. Each profile has a unique identifying code and contains the specific customized food product and feeding instructions recommended for the specific pet The recommended food product includes a pre-manufactured kibble, typically stored at base product display area 16 (shown in Figure 1), the kibble being sometimes referred to as base fonnula food 54, and a customized additive, sometimes referred to herein as a sauce. Ja one embodiment, the pre-manufactured kibble is selected from a variety of pre-manufactured base formula foods 54 (shown in Figure 2) and the additive is a liquid additive that is made on site, typically in the presence of the consumer, and typically at mixing and observation area 20 (shown in • Figure 1). The system directs 110 the kiosk operator to the pre-manufactured kibble best suited for the pet and supplies 112 the operator with a customized additive formula that has been created based upon the individual pet's profile. Arternativery, the system indicates a recommendation for the pet to see a veterinarian prior to baying a customized food, if certain "warning" signs are present in the profile. This warning provides the consumer with added health information about me pet between regular vet visits.<br>
[0015] The kiosk operator men obtains 114 a bag of the recommended kibble and prepares 116 a food additive in bottle 58 (shown in Figure 2) using an additive fonnula at workstation 26, including, but not limited to, a sauce, a gravy, a topping, a thickener, a powder, and a coating, utilizing me customized additive formula. In the exemplary embodiment, a sauce is made, fa addition, customized feeding instructions and package labels are printed 118. The consumer is provided 120 a package containing a bag of dry base formula food 54, such as kibbies, a bottle 58 of customized sauce, printed information, a customized measuring cup 62 (shown in Figure 2) for the dry kibbles, a custom-selected spoon 60 (shown in Figure 2) for measuring the sauce into the food bowl, and any other accessories associated<br>
with the custom food purchase. Additionally, the consumer receives information about the recommended frequency and conditions of future biological sample analyses and/or profile updates for their pet.<br>
[0016] In an alternative embodiment, the pet profile is utilized by the system to direct the kiosk operator to a pre-manufactured kibble (base formula food 54) best suited for the pet and a pre-manufactured sauce best suited for the pet The kiosk operator provides the consumer with the appropriate pre-manufactured kibble and pre-manufactured sauce and the consumer mixes the appropriate amounts of each for the pet.<br>
[0017] For a repeat purchase, a consumer returns to kiosk 10 and provides their pet's unique code, generated during a previous visit, to access their pet's profile. They may update/change the profile information and/or provide a new biological sample, either of which could result in a difference in die recommended food, either the base formula food 54 or the product additive or both. Alternatively, the consumer leaves the profile as is and replenishes their pet's current food supply.<br>
[0018] The process described above is further illustrated by an example.<br>
[0019]   Example<br>
[0020] A pet questionnaire is administered regarding a pet named "Bruno" at a remote manufacturing location, such as a retail store. The questionnaire is completed by Bruno's owner and the following information, among other information, is obtained about Bruno, and provided to the operator of kiosk 10.<br>
Name of pet:	Bruno<br>
Breed of Pet:	Golden Retriever<br>
Weight:	65 Ibs<br>
Age:	4 Years<br>
Gender:	Male<br>
Spayed/Neutered:	Yes<br>
Activity Level:	Moderate<br>
Season:	Summer<br>
Feeding Method:	Measured<br>
Snack Schedule: Flavor Preference: Body Condition:     <br>
Once a day<br>
Chicken for Base and Beef Stew for Sauce<br>
Ideal/Fit<br>
[0021] In addition or in a subsequent visit, Bruno's owner delivers a typical stool sample of Bruno to the kiosk operator where the feeding and care program is being administered. The following stool sample analyses of Bruno is performed.<br>
Moisture:            Normal                <br>
Texture:<br>
Discomfort:          High-Above Normal  <br>
Particulates:            Yes<br>
Color:                     None  <br>
Mucin:                    Normal <br>
Parasites                None to Normal              <br>
                                 None                <br>
 [0022] Based on the above information, a pre-manufactured kibble (Base B2) is selected that is appropriate for adult, medium sized dogs with a moderate level of activity, good body condition score, the desired flavor preference and no other special health condition. Based on the kibble selected, a pre-manufactured sauce is selected (S4) which is appropriate for dogs with hard stool and/or fecal straining issues. The sauce is formulated to be distributed in a 10 oz. bottle and to complement      <br>
(Table Removed)<br>
[0023] Next, an appropriate daily feeding amount is calculated based on the nutrient profile and "sauce" selected, the weight of the dog, body condition, season of the year and snacking habit Both the pre-manufactured kibble and the pre-manufactured sauce are given to the owner with feeding instructions and a copy of the above report. A copy of the individual pet profile and sample stool test is sent to Bruno's veterinarian.<br>
[0024] The methods for customizing pet foods and pet products provide a way for pet food manufacturers to address the individualized health and nutrition requirements, and preferences, of individual pets and their owners. For example, the customized pet food and pet products can be tailored to provide a desired nutritional balance for a pet of a specific age, gender and weight, at a particular time of year, and having a specific health problem, such as, for example, a food allergy. Kiosk 10 provides means and a way for engaging consumers in the marketplace, to introduce the consumers to customized pet foods and further leaves an impression with the consumers of high quality pet and pet food products.<br>
