FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a travelator, moving ramp or escalator.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In prior art, a travelator, moving ramp or escalator is known which comprises a<br>
power means and a conveyor having an end driven by the power means and a non-<br>
driven end. The conveyor comprises a first drive element and a second drive ele-<br>
ment, which are disposed at a distance from each other and parallel to each other,<br>
each being implemented as an endless loop. The drive elements are usually link<br>
chains or toothed belts.<br>
A number of conveyor platforms, such as pallets, are arranged one after the other<br>
and secured to the first and the second drive elements. At the driven end of the con-<br>
veyor, the first drive element is passed over a first driving pulley rotated by the<br>
power means and at the non-driven end over a first diverting pulley. The second<br>
drive element is passed at the driven end of the conveyor over a second driving pul-<br>
ley rotated by the power means and over a second diverting pulley at the non-driven<br>
end. Arranged at the driven end are synchronizing means for mutual synchroniza-<br>
tion of the first driving pulley and the second driving pulley.<br>
The elongations of the drive elements at the non-driven end of the conveyor may be<br>
different.<br>
In conventional prior-art travelators, moving ramps and escalators, the transport<br>
length of the conveyor is reasonably short and the link chains usually employed as<br>
drive elements are of a very heavy design. For example, the effective diameter of the<br>
driving pulley may be of the order of 60 cm and the chain pitch 130 - 150 mm. The<br>
difference of elongation of the link chains on opposite sides does not become very<br>
large and no problem arises.<br><br>
Today, however, there is a need for travelators, moving ramps and/or escalators in<br>
which the transport distances are very long and in which the distance between the<br>
driving and diverting pulleys of the drive elements are consequently also very long.<br>
For example, in very long travelators, the distance between the driving and diverting<br>
pulleys is long, e.g. of the order of 100 meters.<br>
Further, there has arisen a need for low-construction travelators, moving ramps and<br>
escalators designed to be mounted directly on a fixed base, such as a floor, without<br>
any special pits formed in the fixed structure, such as the floor of a building, for<br>
embedded mounting of the frame and machinery of the travelator. In the frame<br>
structure of a travelator, moving ramp or escalator mounted on a fixed base there is<br>
very little space for the drive machine of the conveyor, and therefore the diameter of<br>
the driving and diverting pulleys can not be very large and correspondingly the<br>
drive elements used, such as link chains or belts, are also quite thin, so their elonga-<br>
tions and accordingly the difference of elongation may become large enough to<br>
cause problems. For example, if the drive elements used in a 100 m long conveyor<br>
are link chains with a pitch of 5/8", then the elongation of the link chain may be as<br>
much as about 30 cm. The difference of elongation of the link chains used as first<br>
and second drive elements may be e.g. about 10 cm. The difference of elongation<br>
becomes the more pronounced the longer and thinner the chains are.<br>
The difference of elongation may be due to different tolerances of the chains and/or<br>
different wear resulting from uneven loading of the conveyor. Uneven loading again<br>
may be due to the fact that passengers usually stand on the right-hand side of the<br>
conveyor. Therefore, the drive element on the right-hand side undergoes greater<br>
elongation than does the drive element on the left-hand side.<br>
In prior art, as the diverting pulleys at the non-driven end of the conveyor are in no<br>
way synchronized with each other and because the transport platforms are fastened<br>
to both drive elements, the difference of elongation accumulating at the non-driven<br><br>
end of the conveyor leads to a problematic situation where the transport platforms<br>
especially near the non-driven end of the conveyor tend to move in a position differ-<br>
ing from the mutually parallel position at the driven end, that is to say, in an oblique<br>
position relative to the transport direction, which may result in the transport plat-<br>
forms being stuck on their guide rails, thus stopping the conveyor.<br>
US 2003/0132087 discloses a travelator having pallets connected to two drive<br>
chains which are running between a drive sprocket and a tension sprocket, respec-<br>
tively,<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the present invention is to overcome the above-mentioned drawbacks.<br>
A specific object of the invention is to disclose a travelator, moving ramp or escala-<br>
tor in which it is possible to use longer and thinner cheap drive elements requiring a<br>
lower tolerance accuracy than before.<br>
A further object of the invention is to disclose a travelator, moving ramp or escala-<br>
tor in which unequal wear of the drive elements causes less problems than before.<br>
A further object of the invention is to disclose a travelator, moving ramp or escala-<br>
tor in which the load is better distributed between the drive elements.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to disclose a travelator, moving ramp or esca-<br>
lator in which the transport platforms are prevented from getting into an oblique<br>
position relative to the transport direction at the non-driven end of the conveyor.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

comprising: a power means, and a conveyor having a driven end, which is driven by<br><br>
the power means, and a non-driven end, which has no power means, said conveyor<br>
comprising a first drive element and a second drive element which are at a distance<br>

pulley.<br>

BRIEF DECSRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
In the following, the invention will be described in detail with reference to embodi-<br>
ment examples and the attached drawings, wherein:<br>
Fig. 1 presents a diagrammatic side view of an embodiment of the drive arrange-<br>
ment of the conveyor of the travelator, moving ramp or escalator of the invention,<br>
and<br>
Fig. 2 presents a top view of the drive arrangement shown in Fig. 1.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Fig. 1 and 2 are diagrams representing a low-construction horizontal travelator<br>
mounted on a fixed base, such as a floor or other support, which means that no pit<br>
needs to be made in the fixed base for the travelator machinery. In the following<br>
description of an example, the invention is described in connection with a travelator,<br>
but it is obvious that corresponding principles of the invention can be applied to<br>
moving ramps and escalators as well.<br>
The travelator comprises a conveyor 2, which in this case is a pallet conveyor. The<br>
conveyor 2 is mounted on a conveyor frame 28. The conveyor frame 28 lies on a<br><br>
floor base throughout its length. Secured to the conveyor frame 28 are usually two<br>
balustrades 29 extending alongside the conveyor 2 throughout its length on either<br>
side of it.<br>
In this description, that end of the conveyor 2 which in Fig. 1 and 2 is the right-hand<br>
end and by which the conveyor is driven by a power means 1 is referred to as the<br>
driven end 3. The other end of the conveyor 2, which is not provided with a power<br>
means, is referred to as the non-driven end 4.<br>
The conveyor 2 comprises a first drive element 5 and second drive element 6, which<br>
are at a distance from each other and parallel to each other, each being formed as an<br>
endless loop. A number of transport platforms 7, which in the example are pallets,<br>
have been arranged one after the other and each one of them is fastened from one<br>
side oriented in the transport direction to the first drive element 5 and from the other<br>
side oriented in the transport direction to the second drive element 6. The first and<br>
the second drive elements 5 and 6 may be link chains or alternatively toothed belts.<br>
Placed on one side of the conveyor 2 at the driven end 3 of the conveyor 2 is a first<br>
driving pulley 8 rotated by a power means 1, and a first diverting pulley 9 is pro-<br>
vided at the non-driven end. The first drive element 5 is passed over the first driving<br>
pulley 8 and me first diverting pulley 9.<br>
Correspondingly, on the other side of the conveyor 2 at the driven end 3 of the con-<br>
veyor 2 is a second driving pulley 10 rotated by the power means 1, and a second<br>
diverting pulley 11 is provided at the non-driven end. The second drive element 6 is<br>
passed over the second driving pulley 10 and the second diverting pulley 11.<br>
At the driven end 3, the first driving pulley 8 and the second driving pulley 10 are<br>
mutually synchronized by first synchronizing means 12. The first synchronizing<br>
means 12 comprise as an essential functional part a first synchronizing shaft 14, to<br>
which the power means 1 is connected to rotate it. Mounted on the first synchroniz-<br><br>
ing shaft 14 is a third driving pulley 15. A third diverting pulley 16 is mounted on<br>
the same shaft with the first driving pulley 8. A third drive element 17 is passed as<br>
an endless loop over the third driving pulley 15 and the third diverting pulley 16. A<br>
fourth driving pulley 18 is mounted on the first synchronizing shaft 14 at a distance<br>
from the third driving pulley 15. A fourth diverting pulley 19 is mounted on the<br>
same shaft with the second driving pulley 10. A fourth drive element 20 is passed as<br>
an endless loop over the fourth driving pulley 18 and the fourth diverting pulley 19.<br>
Thus, the driving power is transmitted to both drive elements 5 and 6 via the same<br>
synchronizing shaft 14.<br>
A similar synchronization arrangement is also provided at the non-driven end 4 of<br>
the conveyor 2, where the conveyor 2 comprises second synchronizing means 13 for<br>
mutual synchronization of the first diverting pulley 9 and the second diverting pul-<br>
ley 11. The second synchronizing means 13 at the non-driven end 4 comprise as an<br>
essential functional part a second synchronizing shaft 21. A fifth diverting pulley 22<br>
is mounted on the second synchronizing shaft 21. A sixth diverting pulley 23 is<br>
mounted on the same shaft with the first diverting pulley 9. A fifth drive element 24<br>
is passed as an endless loop over the fifth diverting pulley 22 and the sixth diverting<br>
pulley 23. A seventh diverting pulley 25 is mounted on the second synchronizing<br>
shaft 21 at a distance from the fifth diverting pulley 22. An eighth diverting pulley<br>
26 is mounted on the same shaft with the second diverting pulley 10. A sixth drive<br>
element 27 is passed as an endless loop over the seventh diverting pulley 25 and the<br>
eighth diverting pulley 26. Thus, at the non-driven end 4 the load is equalized be-<br>
tween the two drive elements 5 and 6 via the second synchronizing shaft 21.<br>
As can be seen from Fig. 1 and 2, the conveyor 2 is a pallet conveyor of a flat shape.<br>
The pallets move from the entry end 4 of the conveyor 2 to its exit end 3 and vice<br>
versa along a transport track consisting of upper supporting guide rails provided in<br>
the conveyor frame 28. At the exit end 3 of the conveyor, maintaining their position<br>
and orientation, the pallets move onto a lower return track consisting of lower sup-<br>
porting guide rails provided in the conveyor frame, where the pallets 7 return in the<br><br>
opposite direction relative to the transport direction of the conveyor to the entry end<br>
4 of the conveyor.<br>
From Fig. 2 it can be seen that, as the axis of rotation of the first diverting pulley 9<br>
is on the same axis line L1 with the axis of rotation of the second diverting pulley<br>
11, the second synchronizing shaft 21 is at a distance from the said first axis line L1<br>
outside the track of motion of the transport platforms 7. Similarly, at the other end<br>
of the conveyor 2, the axis of rotation of the first driving pulley 8 is on the same axis<br>
line L2 with the axis of rotation of the second driving pulley 10 and the first syn-<br>
chronizing shaft 14 is at a distance from the said second axis line L2 outside the<br>
track of motion of the transport platforms 7. This arrangement permits the pallets 7<br>
to move at the entry and exit ends of the conveyor from the lower return track to the<br>
upper transport track and vice versa past the synchronizing shafts 14 and 21.<br>
The invention is not limited to the embodiment examples described above; instead,<br>
many variations are possible within the scope of the inventive concept defined in the<br>
claims.<br>

ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
A TRAVELATOR, MOVING RAMP OR ESCALATOR<br>
A travelator, moving ramp or escalator is disclosed. It comprises a power<br>
means (1) and a conveyor (2) having a driven end (3) driven by the power means (1)<br>
and a non-driven end (4). The conveyor comprises a first drive element (5) and a<br>
second drive element (6), which are at a distance from each other and parallel to<br>
each other, each being formed as an endless loop. A number of transport platforms<br>
(7), such as pallets or stairs, are arranged one after the other and secured to the first<br>
(5) and the second (6) drive elements. The first drive element (5) is passed at the<br>
driven end (3) over a first driving pulley (8), which is rotated by the power means<br>
(1), and at the non-driven end (4) over a first diverting pulley (9). The second drive<br>
element (6) is passed at the driven end (3) over a second driving pulley (10), which<br>
is rotated by the power means (1), and over a second diverting pulley (12) at the<br>
non-driven end (4). Placed at the driven end (3) are first synchronizing means (12)<br>
for mutual synchronization of the first driving pulley (8) and the second driving pul-<br>
ley (10). The conveyor (2) additionally comprises second synchronizing means (13),<br>
which have been arranged at the non-driven end (4) for mutual synchronization of<br>
the first diverting pulley (9) and the second diverting pulley (11).</td>
