This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/466,674, filed April 30,2003.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds and their use in controlling insects and acarids. In particular, it pertains to phenyl substituted substituted cyclic derivatives and agriculturally acceptable salts thereof, compositions containing them and methods for their use in controlling insects and acarids.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is well known that insects in general can cause significant damage, not only to crops grown in agriculture, but also, for example, to structures and turf where the damage is caused by soil-borne insects, such as termites and white grubs. Such damage may result in the loss of millions of dollars of value associated with a<br>
given crop, turf or structures. Insecticides and acaricides are useful for controlling insects and acarids which may otherwise cause significant damage to crops such as wheat, corn, soybeans, potatoes, and cotton to name a few. For crop protection, insecticides and acaricides are desired which can control the insects and acarids without damaging the crops, and which have no deleterious effects to mammals and other living organisms.<br>
A number of patents and publications disclose a variety of dihalopropene compounds that are reported to be insecticidally and acaricidally active. For example, U.S. 5,922,880 discloses certain dihalopropene compounds for use as insecticides and acaricides of the general formula:<br>

As depicted in Scheme 5, an appropriately substituted halopyridine (E), for example 2-chloro-5-trifluoromethylpyridine was coupled with an ester such as ethyl isonipecotate, affording the corresponding intermediate (El). Intermediate (El), for example ethyl 2- {l-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-pyridyl]-4-piperidyl} acetate, was reduced with lithium aluminum hydride in an appropriate solvent, affording the corresponding methanol (E2), for example {l-[5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-pyridyl]-4-<br>
piperidyl}methan-l-ol. Intermediate (E2) was then coupled with a phenol, such as the known compound 2,6-dichloro-4-(phenylmethoxy)phenol, affording the corresponding intermediate (E3), for example l,3-dichloro-5-(phenylmethoxy)-2-({1 -[5-(trifluoromethyl)(2-pyridyl)](4-piperidyl)} methoxy)benzene. Intermediate (E3) was in turn treated with hydrogen gas under catalytic conditions in the manner set forth above, which converted the phenylmethoxy moiety of (E3) to a hydroxy' moiety, thereby making the hydroxy moiety available for further reaction. The so-prepared hydroxy derivative (E4) was then reacted with an appropriate haloalkane,<br>
^<br>
for   example,    1,1,1,3-tetrachloropropane,   as   described   above,   yielding   the corresponding dihaloalkene derivative, a compound of formula I, for example 5-(3,3-dichloroprop-2-enyloxy)-l,3-dichloro-2-({l-(trifluoromethyl)(2-pyridyl)](4-piperidyl)}methoxy)benzene.     Example  6,   set  forth below,  provides  detailed methods to how compounds of formula I shown in Scheme 5 were prepared.<br>
One skilled in the art will, of course, recognize that the formulation and mode of application of a toxicant may affect the activity of the material in a given application. Thus, for agricultural use the present insecticidal compounds may be formulated as a granular of relatively large particle size (for example, 8/16 or 4/8 US Mesh), as water-soluble or water-dispersible granules, as powdery dusts, as wettable powders, as emulsifiable concentrates, as aqueous emulsions, as solutions, or as any of other known types of agriculturally-useful formulations, depending on the desired mode of application. It is to be understood that the amounts specified in this specification are intended to be approximate only, as if the word "about" were placed in front of the amounts specified.<br>
These insecticidal compositions may be applied either as water-diluted sprays, or dusts, or granules to the areas in which suppression of insects is desired. These formulations may contain as little as 0.1%, 0.2% or 0.5% to as much as 95% or more by weight of active ingredient.<br>
Dusts are free flowing admixtures of the active ingredient with finely divided solids such as talc, natural clays, kieselguhr, flours such as walnut shell and cottonseed flours, and other organic and inorganic solids which act as dispersants and carriers for the toxicant; these finely divided solids have an average particle size of less than about 50 microns. A typical dust formulation useful herein is one containing 1.0 part or less of the insecticidal compound and 99.0 parts of talc.<br>
Wettable powoers, also useful formulations for insecticides, are in the form of finely divided particles that disperse readily in water or other dispersant. The wettable powder is ultimately applied to the locus where insect control is needed either as a dry dust or as an emulsion in water or other liquid. Typical earners for wettable powders include Fuller's earth, kaolin clays, silicas, and other highly absorbent, readily wet inorganic diluents. Wettable powders normally are prepared to contain about 5-80% of active ingredient, depending on the absorbency of the carrier, and usually also contain a small amount of a wetting, dispersing or emulsifying agent to facilitate dispersion. For example, a useful wettable powder formulation contains 80.0 parts of the insecticidal compound, 17.9 parts of Palmetto clay, and 1.0 part of sodium lignosulfonate and 0.3 part of sulfonated aliphatic polyester as wetting agents. Additional wetting agent and/or oil will frequently be added to a tank mix for to facilitate dispersion on the foliage of the plant.<br>
Other useful formulations for insecticidal applications are emulsifiable concentrates (ECs) which are homogeneous liquid compositions dispersible in water or other dispersant, and may consist entirely of the insecticidal compound and a liquid or solid emulsifying agent, or may also contain a liquid carrier, such as xylene, heavy aromatic naphthas, isphorone, or other non-volatile organic solvents. For insecticidal application these concentrates are dispersed in water or other liquid carrier and normally applied as a spray to the area to be treated. The percentage by weight of the essential active ingredient may vary according to the manner in which the composition is to be applied, but in general comprises 0.5 to 95% of active ingredient by weight of the insecticidal composition.<br>
Flowable formulations are similar to ECs, except that the active ingredient is suspended in a liquid carrier, generally water. Flowables, like ECs, may include a small amount of a surfactant, and will typically contain active ingredients in the range of 0.5 to 95%, frequently from 10 to 50%, by weight of the composition. For application, flowables may be diluted in water or other liquid vehicle, and are normally applied as a spray to the area to be treated.<br>
Typical wetting, dispersing or emulsifying agents used in agricultural formulations include, but are not limited to, the alkyl and alkylaryl sulfonates and sulfates and their sodium salts; alkylaryl polyether alcohols; sulfated higher alcohols; polyethylene oxides; sulfonated animal and vegetable oils; sulfonated<br>
petroleum oils; fatty acid esters of polyhydric alcohols and the ethylene oxide addition products of such esters; and the addition product of long-chain mercaptans and ethylene oxide. Many other types of useful surface-active agents are available in commerce. Surface-active agents, when used, normally comprise 1 to 15% by weight of the composition.<br>
Other useful formulations include suspensions of the active ingredient in a relatively non-volatile solvent such as water, corn oil, kerosene, propylene glycol, or other suitable solvents.<br>
Still other useful formulations for insecticidal applications include simple solutions of the active ingredient in a solvent in which it is completely soluble at the desired concentration, such as acetone, alkylated naphthalenes, xylene, or other organic solvents. Granular formulations, wherein the toxicant is carried on relative coarse particles, are of particular utility for aerial distribution or for penetration of cover crop canopy. Pressurized sprays, typically aerosols wherein the active ingredient is dispersed in finely divided form as a result of vaporization of a low-boiling dispersant solvent carrier may also be used. Water-soluble or water-dispersible granules are free flowing, non-dusty, and readily water-soluble or water-miscible. In use by the farmer on the field, the granular formulations, emulsifiable concentrates, flowable concentrates, aqueous emulsions, solutions, etc., may be diluted with water to give a concentration of active ingredient in the range of say 0.1% or 0.2% to 1.5% or 2%.<br>
The active insecticidal compounds of this invention may be formulated and/or applied with one or more second compounds. Such combinations may provide certain advantages, such as, without limitation, exhibiting synergistic effects for greater control of insect pests, reducing rates of application of insecticide thereby minimizing any impact to the environment and to worker safety, controlling a broader spectrum of insect pests, safening of crop plants to phytotoxicity, and improving tolerance by non-pest species, such as mammals and fish.<br>
Second compounds include, without limitation, other pesticides, plant growth regulators, fertilizers, soil conditioners, or other agricultural chemicals. In applying an active compound of this invention, whether formulated alone or with other agricultural chemicals, an effective amount and concentration of the active compound is of course employed; the amount may vary in the range of, e.g. about<br>
0.001 to about 3 kg/ha, preferably about 0.03 to about 1 kg/ha. For field use, where there are losses of insecticide, higher application rates (e.g., four times the rates mentioned above) may be employed.<br>

Insecticidal Phenyl Substituted Cyclic Derivatives Compound Characterization<br>
(Table 2 Removed)<br><br>
Candidate insecticides were evaluated for activity against the tobacco budworm (Heliothis yirescens [Fabricius]) in a surface-treated diet test.<br>
In this test one mL of molten (65-70°C) wheat germ-based artificial diet was pipetted into each well of a four by six (24 well) multi-well plate (E)# 430345-15.5 mm dia. x 17.6 mm deep; Corning Costar Corp., One Alewife Center, Cambridge, MA 02140). The diet was allowed to cool to ambient temperature before treatment with candidate insecticide.<br>
For a determination of insecticidal activity, solutions of the candidate<br>
® insecticides were prepared for testing using a Packard 204DT Multiprobe   Robotic<br>
System (Packard Instrument Company, 800 Research Parkway, Meriden, CT 06450), in which the robot first diluted a standard 50 milh'molar DMSO solution of candidate insecticide with a 1:1 water/acetone solution (V/V) in a ratio of 1:7 stock solution to water/acetone. The robot subsequently pipetted 40 microliters of the so-prepared solution onto the surface of the diet in each of three wells in the 24 multi-well plate. The process was repeated with solutions of seven other candidate<br>
insecticides. Once treated, the contents of the multi-well plate were allowed to dry, leaving 0.25 millimoles of candidate insecticide on the surface of the diet, or a concentration of 0.25 millimolar. Appropriate untreated controls containing only DMSO on the diet surface were also included in this test.<br>
For evaluations of the insecticidal activity of a candidate insecticide at varying rates of application, the test was established as described above using sub-multiples of the standard 50 millimolar DMSO solution of candidate insecticide. For example, the standard 50 millimolar solution was diluted by the robot with DMSO to give 5, 0.5, 0.05, 0.005, 0.0005 milimolar, or more dilute solutions of the candidate insecticide. In these evaluations there were six replicates of each rate of application placed on the surface of the diet in the 24 multi-well plate, for a total of four rates of application of candidate insecticide in each plate.<br>
In each well of the test plate was placed one second instar tobacco budworm larvea, each weighing approximately five milligrams. After the larvae were placed in each well, the plate was sealed with clear polyfilm adhesive tape. The tape over each well was perforated to ensure an adequate air supply.. The plates were then held in a growth chamber at 25 °C and 60% relative humidity for five days (light 14 hours/day).<br>
After the five-day exposure period insecticidal activity for each rate of application of candidate insecticide was assessed as percent inhibition of insect weight relative to the weight of insects from untreated controls, and percent mortality when compared to the total number of insects infested.<br>
Insecticidal activity data at selected rates of application from this test are provided in Table 3. The test compounds of formula I are identified by numbers that correspond to those in Table 1.<br>
