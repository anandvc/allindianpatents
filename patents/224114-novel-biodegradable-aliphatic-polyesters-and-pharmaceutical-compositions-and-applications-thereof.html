The following specification describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br><br><br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to novel biodegradable aliphatic polyesters derived from fatty diacids and fatty diols with even number of carbon atoms, pharmaceutical compositions and applications thereof. More particularly pharmaceutical composition comprises at least one pharmaceutically active ingredient and the said biodegradable aliphatic polyester in the form of various drug delivery systems.<br>
Background and Prior Art<br>
With the increasing demand for biodegradable/biocompatible polymers, aliphatic polymers like poly-lactic acid, poly-glycolide, copolymers of lactide-glycolide are gaining importance. These polymers are synthesized mostly by either ring opening polymerization or by direct polycondensation technique. These polyesters are very expensive as compared to the other polymers, which are widely used. Because of its very high cost, these polyesters find very less commercial usage but because of the GRAS status, these polymers are in great demand.<br>
In the pharmaceutical field, the trend in drug delivery has been towards biodegradable polymer excipients for controlled release formulation and for implants as it would not require follow-up surgical removal once the drug supply is depleted. The most widely investigated and advanced polymer with regard to available toxicological and clinical data, are the aliphatic polyesters based on glycolide/lactide, which include poly-lactic acid, poly-glycolide, copolymers of lactide-glycolide.<br>
Various applications of these polymers are reported in literature, for example<br>
US Patent 5,478,564 and US Patent 5,609,886 describe a preparation method for the microparticles of copolymers of lactic acid and glycolic acid for controlled release of water soluble pharmaceutically active agents.<br>
US Patent 5,705, 197 describes methods for preparation of microparticles of vaccine and biologically active substances using poly- (D, L) lactide co-glycolide.<br>
2<br><br>

US Patent 6,159,502 discusses microparticles of poly (lactic acid) and its copolymers coupled with a carrier for oral delivery of substances to the circulation or lymphatic drainage of the host. The carriers are mucosal binding proteins, bacterial adhesions, viral adhesions, toxic binding subunits, lectins, Vitamin B.sub.12 and analogues or derivatives of Vitamin B.sub.12 possessing binding activity to Castle's intrinsic factor.<br>
US Patent 6,296,667 uses poly-lactic acid as a bone substitute and US Patent 6,338,859 uses poly-lactic acid, poly-glycolic acid, poly- (D-lactic acid), poly- (D, L-lactic acid), lactide/glycolide copolymers for micelle formation along with poly-vinyl pyrrolidone for the delivery of and cancer drugs.<br>
US Patent 6,511,748 mentions the use of PLA and PGA as core material in bioabsorbable fibers, which are used, for fracture fixation and spinal fusion<br>
Poly-(lactide/glycolide) has been used to make films containing antibiotics for the insertion into the periodontal pocket as described in Journal of Controlled Release 3(1993), 137-146.<br>
Various methods are described in literature for the synthesis of biodegradable polymers other than PLA, PLGA.<br>
US Patent 6,515,054 and related patents use filler along with the biodegradable polymer to lower the cost of the polymer and to accelerate biodegradation<br>
US Patent 6,303,677 describes a method for preparing a method biodegradable polymer by using adipic acid or ester forming derivatives or terphthalic acid and C-2 to C-6 substituted alkanediols or C-10 cycloalkanediols. These polymers have been used for making moldings or are blended with starch to obtain moulds.<br>
3<br><br><br>
US Patent 6,201,072 highlights a biodegradable ABA or BAB type of triblock polymer of poly- (Jactide-co-glycolide) and polyethylene glycol which possesses reverse thermal gelation properties. This polymer has been used for pharmaceutical applications.<br>
US Patent 6,133,404 describes a biodegradable polymer containing at least one aliphatic dicarboxylic acid containing 2-14 carbon atoms and at least one aromatic or alicyclic carboxylic acid and one glycol. This polymer exhibits good mechanical strength and can replace pre-existing expensive aliphatic polyesters. No pharmaceutical use of this polymer is reported<br>
Patent Application WO 0055236 describes a method for synthesizing aliphatic polyesters using aliphatic dicarboxylic acids and aliphatic glycols. This polymer finds applications in various fields like food packing material, films, semi-expanded and expanded products, fibers, fabrics, composites with mineral and vegetable filler, bottles for food, cosmetics and pharmaceutical field<br>
US Patent 5,919,835 describes polymer blends of two or more polyanhydrides and polyester or their mixtures as a carrier for pharmaceutically active agent<br>
US Patent 5,585, 460 highlights a method for synthesis of high molecular weight aliphatic polyester of lactic acid and glycolic acid to obtain microparticles of the polyester containing the medicament for pharmaceutical application.<br>
As described above PLA, PLGA polyesters have a wide range of pharmaceutical applications. However this class of polyester has two main disadvantages, limited hydrolytic stability because of high concentration of ester linkages on the backbone, which leads to their hydrolysis in the presence of atmospheric moisture and high cost which is a limiting factor on its commercial usage.<br>
Hence it is essential to have polyesters, which are less expensive, hydrolytically stable, have good mechanical properties, are easy to synthesize, biodegradable, biocompatible and safe for use in living organisms.<br>
4<br><br>
It is known that fats undergo metabolism in the liver by beta- oxidation where two carbon atoms in the fatty acid chain are removed in each cycle and hence fatty diacids with even number of carbon atoms are easily metabolized. Fatty diacids having odd number of carbon atoms are toxic due to formation of formic acid as a degradation product.<br>
Polyesters of diols containing even number of carbon atoms and diacids with even number of carbon atoms could be synthesized by conventional condensation polymerization technique, direct polymerization technique.<br>
Other patents describe the use of diacids and diols for aliphatic polyester synthesis for engineering applications. However the toxicity and in-vitro biodegradation of these polymers is not extensively studied. Also the use of these polymers for pharmaceutical applications is not completely described.<br>
In the present invention, synthesis of polyesters of diols and diacids which contain even number of carbon atoms, which are biodegradable and non-toxic to living animals and could be used for a wide pharmaceutical application at a much lower cost are described.<br>
Objective<br>
An object of the present invention is to develop a pharmaceutical composition using aliphatic polyester which has good stability, excellent mechanical properties, is easy to synthesize, less expensive, biodegradable, biocompatible and safe for use in living animals in the form of different drug delivery system.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
Novel biodegradable aliphatic polyesters derived from fatty diacids and fatty diols with even number of carbon atoms, pharmaceutical compositions and applications thereof wherein the said pharmaceutical compositions comprises at least one pharmaceutically active ingredient and the said biodegradable aliphatic polyester and<br>
5<br><br>
the said pharmaceutical compositions are in the form of different drug delivery systems such as drug loaded microparticles, molded implants, coated granules, injectable sustained release particles, stents, films, matrix tablet, coated tablets, dry syrup, mouth dissolving tablets, microparticles dispersed in gels, taste masked formulation, inserts (ophthalmic), fibers, ligatures and sutures.<br>
A biodegradable aliphatic polymer is synthesized by conventional condensation polymerization method from a diol and diacid as the starting material, both of which contain even number of carbon atoms in the presence of a catalyst. Para-toluene sulphonic acid is used as the catalyst. Solid-state condensation is carried out to increase the molecular weight.<br>
The polymer thus formed can be used for making various pharmaceutical formulations which include drug loaded microparticles by suitable process, molded implants, coated granules, injectable sustained release particles, stents, films, matrix tablets, coated tablets, dry syrup, mouth dissolving tablets, microparticles dispersed in gels, taste masked formulation, inserts, fibers, ligatures and sutures.<br>
Detailed Description<br>
The present invention is related to development of various pharmaceutical compositions using biodegradable aliphatic polyesters synthesized by conventional condensation polymerization technique from diols containing 2-50 carbon atoms and dicarboxylic acid containing 1-50 carbon atoms. The number of carbon atoms for diols and carboxylic acid is not a limiting factor but both containing even number of carbon atoms and terminal carboxy groups is essential. The synthesis is carried out in two steps by using two different catalyst which are, para-toluene sulphonic acid in esterification step and Zinc acetate in condensation step. Carbon-dioxide is treated as a dicarboxylic acid as a special case and can be incorporated by transesterification using dimethylcarbonate or ethylene carbonate.<br>
Aliphatic polyesters of various molecular weights could be obtained by this method by varying conditions in the condensation step.<br>
6<br><br>
Aliphatic polyester synthesized by this method has good thermal stability and excellent mechanical properties. The in-vitro degradation of the polymer occurs in the presence of lipase to low molecular weight compounds. The synthesized class of polyester would undergo same degradation pattern in living animals.<br>
On determination as per OECD guidelines, the LD50 of the synthesized polymer is observed to be more than 2000 mg /kg of body weight when tested in male albino mice. When said polymer is administered for a prolonged period of time, no tissue accumulation is seen in mice indicating its biodegradability in living animals. Hence this polymer could be used safely in all living animals.<br>
The biodegradability and safe toxic limits of these aliphatic polyesters makes them useful in pharmaceutical applications.<br>
The biodegradable aliphatic polyester obtained by this invention is used as the base for microcapsules. The sustained release microcapsules containing a water insoluble drug can be produced by preparing an oil/water suspension system, in which the medicament is embedded within the polymer particles, which forms the oil phase, and the aqueous phase contains stabilizing agents for the microparticles. The stabilizing agent forms a thin protective layer around the droplets and hence reduces the extent of droplet coalescence and coagulation. The stabilizing agents, which could be used, are polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, alginate, gelatin, methyl cellulose, polyoxyethylene derivatives of sorbitan fatty esters [Tweens] and polyoxyethylene fatty ethers [Brij].<br>
The micro/ nano particles are prepared by either solvent -evaporation technique or solvent extraction technique. The micro/ nano particles thus formed by this method are made into various dosage forms for administration by the living animals. The dosage forms are tablets, sustained release granules filled in capsules, microparticulate implants for periodontitis, microparticulate implants for synovial joint and other such formulations. The polymer is used for coating the granules in order to get sustained action and for preparation of biodegradable stents.<br>
7<br><br>
The particle size of the nano / micro particles derived from the novel biodegradable aliphatic polyesters is in the range of 10 nm to 1000 microns depending on the type and concentration of stabilizer and drug to polymer ratio used in the formulation.<br>
The drug to polymer ratio in pharmaceutical compositions is selected from 95:5 to 1:99.<br>
In addition to the microparticles, the polymer could be molded into different shapes by melting the polymer and dispersing the medicament to obtain implants for the sustained release of the medicament for prolonged period of time. The polymer implant could be in circular, cylindrical or any other molded form.<br>
