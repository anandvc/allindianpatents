				<td>CARBOXAMIDINE DERIVATIVES AND THEIR USE, IN THE TREATMENT OF VASCULAR DISEASES<br>
Pharmaeuutically effective compounds<br>
The invention relates to pharmaceutically effective hydroxylamine<br>
derivatives, which are useful h the treatment of vascular diseases.<br>
The invention relates to the use of compounds of general formulae (I),<br>
(I!) and (IK) ~<br>
R1 and R2 independently represent a hydrogen atom or a straight or<br>
branched C1-6 alkyl group optionally substituted with a phenyl group, or<br>
R1 and R2 together with the nitrogen atom attached thereto form a 5-7<br>
membered saturated heterocyclic ring optionally containing further nitrogen<br>
and/or oxygen heteroatoms, which heterocyclic ring is optionally substituted<br>
with one or more hydroxy, oxo or benzyl groups,<br>
A represents a phenyl group optionally substituted with one or more C1-4<br>
alkyl, C1-4 haloalkyl or nitro groups or halogen atoms, or a 5-6 membered<br>
heteroaromatic ring containing one or more nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur<br>
heteroatoms, optionally having N-oxide structure on the nitrogen heteroatom,<br>
n is zero, 1 or 2,<br>
z is zero or 1,<br>
in compounds of general formulae (I), X represents a halogen atom or -<br>
NR4R5 group, where R4 and R5 independently represent a hydrogen atom or<br>
a straight or branched C1-6 alkyl group,<br>
in compounds of general formulae (II), X refers to oxygen atom,<br>
R3 represents a hydrogen atom or a straight or branched C1-6 alkyl group,<br>
Y represents a hydrogen atom or hydroxy group, halogen atom or C1-22<br>
acyloxy group, with the restriction that if R4 and R5 are simultaneously<br>
hydrogen atoms, Y is other than hydroxy group,<br>
with the proviso that in compounds of general formulaee (I) and (II) where Y<br>
is other than halogen,<br><br>
a)	R1 and R2 together with the nitrogen atom attached thereto form a<br>
5-7 membered, saturated haterocyclic ring optionally containing further<br>
nitrogen and/or oxygen heteroatom, which heterocyclic ring is substituted<br>
with one or more hydroxy, oxo or benzyl groups and/or<br>
b)	A is a N-containing heteroaromatic ring, which has N-oxide<br>
structure on the nitrogen heteroatom, and/or<br>
c)	z is 1,<br>
with the further proviso that if X is halo and Y is hydroxy or acyloxy in<br>
compounds of general formulse (I),<br>
R1 and R2 together with the nitrogen atom attached thereto form a 5-7<br>
membered, saturated heterocyclic ring optionally containing further nitrogen<br>
and/or oxygen heteroatom, which heterocyclic ring is substituted with one or<br>
more hydroxy, oxo or benzyl croups and<br>
with the proviso for compounds of general formulae (III) that<br>
if R1 and R2 independently represent a hydrogen atom or a straight or<br>
branched Ci.6 alkyl group optionally substituted with a phenyl group,<br>
or together with the nitrogen atom attached thereto form a 5-7 membered<br>
saturated heterocyclic ring optionally containing further nitrogen and/or<br>
oxygen heteroatoms, then A is a heteroaromatic ring containing oxygen or<br>
sulfur heteroatom or an N-containing heteroaromatic ring having N-oxide<br>
structure on the nitrogen heteroatom and<br>
if A is a phenyl group optionally substituted with one or more C1-4 alkyl, C1-4<br>
haloalkyl or nitro groups or halogen atoms, or a 5-6 membered N-containing<br>
heteroaromatic ring, then R1 and R2 together with the nitrogen atom attached<br>
thereto form a 5-7 membered, saturated heterocyclic ring optionally<br>
containing further nitrogen ard/or oxygen heteroatom, which heterocyclic ring<br>
is substituted with one or mote hydroxy, oxo or benzyl groups,<br>
and of the salts and optically active forms of the above compounds for the<br>
production of pharmaceutical products used in the treatment and/or<br>
prevention of vascular diseases or diseases related to vascular disorders.<br><br>
Compounds of similar structure are known from WO 97/16439. These<br>
compounds increase molecuar chaperon expression, or molecular chaperon<br>
activity in cell exposed to a physiological stress. Due to this characteristic,<br>
they are useful for the treatment of diseases connected with the functioning<br>
of the chaperon system.<br>
The protective and regenerating effect that compounds of similar<br>
structures have for vascular 3ndothelial cells is known from WO 98/06400.<br>
These compounds are primarily useful for the prevention of damage caused<br>
by ischemia and for the treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular<br>
diseases.<br>
We have found that when the hydroxylamine derivatives described in<br>
the cited literature are chemically modified, preferably in such a way that,<br>
according to general formulaee (I), (II) and (III) above,<br>
1)	a halogen atom is introduced into the propylene group of the<br>
aminopropyl group connected, the hydroxylamine part as substituent and/or<br>
2)	N-oxide is formed on the nitrogen atoms in the terminal groups of<br>
the molecule, namely on the nitrogen atom connected to the propylene group<br>
of the above mentioned aminopropyl group and/or on the nitrogen atom<br>
located in the heteroaromatic ring of the molecule,<br>
then the resulting products are hydroxylamine derivatives which possess<br>
much more favorable pharmacological properties against vascular illnesses<br>
than known compounds which have been found to be useful for this purpose.<br>
Namely, the effect of these compounds is more intensive than that of the<br>
known prior art compounds used for similar purposes. Therefore they are<br>
especially useful as active ingredients in the treatment or prevention of<br>
vascular diseases or diseases associated with vascular disorders.<br>
Based on this observation, this invention relates to the use of<br>
compounds of general formulate (I), (II) and (III) -where R1, R2, R3, A, X, Y,<br>
n and z are as above -, and to the use of the salts and optically active forms<br>
of the above compounds for the production of pharmaceutical products for<br><br>
the treatment and/or prevention of vascular diseases or diseases associated<br>
with vascular disorders.<br>

(III) are novel compounds.<br>

The biological effects of the compounds of the invention were tested by<br>
the following experiments:<br>
Wounding migration assay in endothelial cell culture<br>
The effect of the compounds of the invention on the wounded monolayers<br>
of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were studied in a cell<br>
culture system (in vitro). After reaching confluence, the HUVEC cells were<br>
wounded according to the method of Yamamura et al (J. Surgical Res. 63,<br>
349-354, 1996). The number of migrated cells were registered using<br>
computerized image analysis 24 hours after wounding in the absence and<br>
presence of the active agents under testing in a concentration of 10-6 M. The<br>
active ingredient described in publication no. WO 98/06400, namely 5,6-<br>
dihydro-5-(1-piperidinyl)-methyl-3-(3-pyridyl)-4H-1,2,4-oxadiazine was used<br>
as reference compound. The obtained results are given in Table 1.<br><br>
In the following, we give the results of the test of blood vessel relaxing effect,<br>
performed in vitro on rat vessels, and also the morpholocial results of the<br>
thoracic aorta.<br><br>
Three-month-old, genelially hypertonic (SH) Wistar Okamoto rats<br>
were treated for one month with various test compounds. Thereafter the<br>
functional and morphological tests were performed.<br>
The vaso-relaxing effect of the compounds of the invention on the<br>
thoracic aorta of SH rats (in vitro testing)<br>
The test was performed by the method known from the literature<br>
[Japan J. Pharmacol., 59, 339-347 (1992)]. The SH rats were anesthetized<br>
with Nembutal (40 mg/kg, i. p.), then the thoracic aorta was removed and<br>
placed in oxygenized (95 % O2 + 5% CO2) Krebs-Henseleit solution. The<br>
composition of the solution (mM): NaCI 118, KCI 4,7, CaCI2 2,52, MgSO4<br>
1,64, NaHCO3 24,88, KH2PO4 1,18, glucose 5,5. The 3-mm-long aorta rings<br>
were suspended in a 20 ml organ bath of 37°C. The resting tension was 1g,<br>
which was maintained throughout the equilibration. During the 1 hour<br>
equilibration, the medium was changed in every 20 minutes. The vessels<br>
were contracted with 10"6 M methoxamine (approx. 80% of maximal<br>
contraction). After reaching the maximal contraction, we tested the<br>
vasodilation resulting as the effect of the acetylcholine (Ach) (10-6 - 10-4 M),<br>
which informed us about the condition of the endothelium of the vessel wall.<br>
The contraction force was measured by an isometric strain gauge (SG-01D,<br>
Experimentia Ltd), and was registered on an OH-850 polygraph (Radelkis).<br>
At this time again, 5,6-dihydro-5-(1-piperidinyl)-methyl-3-(3-pyridyl)-4H-1,2,4-<br>
oxadiazine as described in WO 98/06400 was used as a reference<br>
compound. The results of these tests are summarized in Table 2.<br>

As the table shows, we registered a 30% relaxation decrease in the<br>
case of untreated hypertonic animals, which is the result of hypertonia-<br>
induced endothelial damage. The test compounds improved the relaxation<br>
properties of the vessels sigr ificantly, which is the result of the improved<br>
functioning of the endothelium, due to the relative increase of the<br>
endothelium-related relaxation factors.<br>
Morphological testing of the thoracic aortas with electron microscopy<br>
The test was performed according to the procedure known from the<br>
literature (Br. J. of Pharmacol., 1995; 115, 415-420). 1 mm2 pieces of the<br>
aorta wall was cut out of the thoracic aorta of the rats, and were then fixed<br>
with 2.5% glutaraldehyde at room temperature for 2 hours. This was followed<br>
by a post-fixation with 1% osmum tetroxide for 1 hour. Afterwards, the tissue<br>
pieces were dehydrated with etianol, and embedded in Durcupan ACM. The<br>
samples were evaluated qualitatively based on the images recorded on a<br>
Hitachi 7100 electron microscope. The results of the test are given in Table<br>
3.<br>

The results of the morphological test are expressed on a scale of 1 to<br>
5, depending upon the degree to which the treatment with various test<br>
compounds restored the hyportonia-induced endothelium damage, that is,<br>
upon the degree of regeneration activity observed. On the scale, 1 was used<br>
to refer to cases where no regeneration was observable, 2 refers to weak, 3<br>
to average, 4 to good, and 5 to strong regeneration.<br>
When comparing it to the untreated control, significant protective and<br>
regenerative effect was observed after treatment with the compounds of the<br>
invention. Due to the treatment, a thin, freshly formed layer covered the<br>
wounded sub-endothelium, which contained cells with active nuclei and rich<br>
cytoplasm. Regeneration was shown to be very effective in the case of the<br>
majority of the tested molecules.<br>
Compounds of general formulae (I) where Y is a halogen atom are prepared<br>
by halogenating the suitable compound containing a hydroxyl group as Y<br>
substituent. The other compounds of the invention are prepared by the<br>
known method, according to the procedures given in WO 97/16439 and WO<br>
98/06400. Methods for the preparation of certain compounds are<br>
demonstrated in the examples.<br>
The compositions of the invention can be made in solid or liquid forms<br>
generally used in human and veterinary therapy. For oral administration<br>
tablets, coated tablets, dragees, granules, capsules, solutions or syrups, for<br>
rectal administration suppositories, and for parenteral administration<br>
lyophylised or not lyophylised injections or infusion solutions can be prepared<br>
by known preparation methods. The oral compositions may contain fillers<br>
such as microcrystalline cellulose, starch, lactose, lubricants, such as stearic<br>
acid and magnesium stearate coating materials such as sugar, film materials<br><br>
such as hydroxymethyl cellulose, flavors or sweeteners such as methyl<br>
paraben or saccharine, and colorants. Auxiliaries in the suppositories may be<br>
for example cocoa butter and polyethylene glycol. The compositions for<br>
parenteral use may contain saline or optional dispersing and wetting agents<br>
such as propylene glycol along with the active ingredient.<br>
The dose of the compounds of the invention depends on the illness of<br>
the patient and the disease and varies from 0.1 to 200 mg/kg/day, preferably<br>
