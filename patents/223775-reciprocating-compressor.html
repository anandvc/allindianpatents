				<td>RECIPROCATING COMPRESSOR<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a reciprocating compressor, and<br>
particularly to a reciprocating compressor capable of improving its<br>
productivity by simplifying a fabrication process.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In general, a reciprocating compressor is an apparatus for sucking,<br>
compressing and discharging gas while a piston reciprocates in a cylinder.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, a conventional reciprocating compressor includes<br>
a casing 110 having a gas suction pipe 112 and a gas discharging pipe114; a<br>
reciprocating motor 130 disposed in the casing 110 for generating a driving<br>
force; a compression unit 140 for sucking, compressing and discharging gas<br>
by the driving force of the reciprocating motor 130; a resonant spring unit 150<br>
for providing a reciprocating movement of the reciprocating motor with a<br>
resonant movement; and a frame unit 120 for supporting the reciprocating<br>
motor 130, the compression unit 140 and the resonant spring unit 150<br>
respectively.<br>
The reciprocating motor 130 includes an outer stator 131; an inner<br>
stator 132 disposed at a certain air gap between itself and an inner<br>
circumference of the outer stator 131; and a magnet paddle 133 formed with<br>
a magnet 134 disposed between the outer stator 131 and the inner stator 132,<br>
thus to be linearly reciprocated by electromagnetic interaction of the outer<br>
and inner stators 131 and 132, and the magnet 134.<br>
The compression unit 140 includes a cylinder 141 having an inner<br>
space; a piston 142 disposed in the inner space of the cylinder 141,<br>
connected with the magnet paddle 133 of the reciprocating motor 130 to be<br>
linearly reciprocated, and, with this reciprocating movement, varying a<br>
volume of a compression space (P) in the cylinder 141; a suction valve 143<br>
mounted at a front side of the piston 142 (hereinafter, a side where gas is<br>
sucked will be referred to a rear, and a side where compressed gas is<br>
discharged to a front), and operated according to pressure in the<br>
compression space (P) for opening or closing a suction flow (F) of gas; and a<br>
discharging valve 144 installed at a front of the cylinder 141 for opening or<br>
closing a discharge of the compressed gas.<br>
The frame unit 120 includes a first frame 121 mounted at a front side<br>
of the reciprocating motor 130 and the cylinder 141; a second frame 122<br>
connected with the first frame 121 for supporting the outer stator 131 of the<br>
reciprocating motor 130 with the first frame 121; and a third frame 123<br>
connected with the second frame 122 for receiving and supporting the<br>
resonant spring unit 150 with the second frame 122.<br>
The resonant spring unit 150 includes a spring seat panel 151<br>
disposed between the second frame 122 and the third frame 123, connected<br>
with the piston 142 to be linearly reciprocated; a first spring 152 disposed<br>
between the second frame 122 and the spring seat panel 151, and shrunk<br>
when the piston 142 moves frontward and elongated when the piston moves<br>
rearward; a second spring 153 disposed between the third frame 123 and the<br>
spring seat panel 151, and elongated when the piston 142 moves frontward<br>
and shrunk when the piston 142 moves rearward.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, the second frame 122 is formed as a disc shape,<br>
and supports the first spring 152. The third frame 123 is formed as a<br>
cylindrical shape, and includes a cylindrical portion 123b receiving the first<br>
and second springs 152 and 153 and the spring seat panel 151 therein; a<br>
spring supporting portion 123c extended from the rear side of the cylindrical<br>
portion 123b in an inner circumferential direction thereof, and supporting the<br>
second spring 153; and a flange portion 123a extended from a front side of<br>
the cylindrical portion 123b in an outer circumferential direction of the<br>
cylindrical portion 123b, and fixed at a surface of the second frame 122.<br>
Herein, a spacer 160 is interposed between the second frame 122<br>
and the flange portion 123a of the third frame 123. The spacer 160 is to set<br>
an initial location of the piston 142, and, according to a thickness of the<br>
spacer 160, a location of the piston 142 in the cylinder 141 is varied.<br>
Operations of the conventional reciprocating compressor configured<br>
as above will now be described. When an electric power is applied to the<br>
reciprocating motor 130, the magnet paddle 133 is linearly reciprocated by<br>
electromagnetic interaction of the outer stator 131, the inner stator 132 and<br>
the magnet 134. According to this, the piston 142 connected with the magnet<br>
paddle 133 is linearly reciprocated in the cylinder 141, and thus varies a<br>
volume of the compression space (P). Accordingly, by change of the volume<br>
of the compression space (P), gas is sucked into the compression space (P),<br>
compressed, and discharged, and a series of these processes is repeated. At<br>
this time, since the first and second springs 152 and 153 supported between<br>
the second frame 122 and the third frame 123 provide the reciprocal<br>
movement of the piston 142 with a resonant movement, effect of the linear<br>
and reciprocal movement of the piston 142 becomes greater.<br>
In the fabrication process of the conventional reciprocating<br>
compressor, an additive spacer 160 is inserted between the second frame<br>
122 and the third frame 123 so that an initial location of the piston 142 can be<br>
adjusted in consideration of a stroke of the piston 142. According to the<br>
thickness of the spacer 160, the location of the piston 142 is adjusted from a<br>
dotted line to a solid line of FIG. 2.<br>
However, in the structure for adjusting an initial location of a piston of<br>
the conventional reciprocating compressor as above, after determining a<br>
thickness of the spacer 160 and assembling the second and third frames 122<br>
and 123, it can be determined whether the initial location of the piston 142<br>
has been properly set or not. So, in case that the thickness of the spacer 160<br>
has been determined inadequately, or a planning location of the piston is<br>
changed by production tolerance of the reciprocating compressor, the<br>
reciprocating compressor has to be disassembled, and reassembled with<br>
repeating the fabrication process.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a<br>
reciprocating compressor capable of simplifying its fabrication process and<br>
thus improving productivity by readily adjusting an initial portion of a piston in<br>
fabricating a reciprocating compressor.<br>
To achieve the above object, there is provided a reciprocating compressor comprising: a<br>
reciprocating motor disposed in a casing, and generating a driving force; a compression unit for<br>
sucking, compressing, and discharging gas by the driving force of the reciprocating motor; a resonant<br>
spring unit for providing a reciprocating movement of the reciprocating motor with a resonant<br>
movement; and at least two spring supporting frames by which the resonant spring unit is supported,<br>
characterized in that one of the spring supporting frames is inserted into another spring supporting<br>
frame for being coupled with each other.<br>

space (P) in the cylinder 41; a suction valve 43 mounted at a front side of the<br>
piston 42 (hereinafter, a side where gas is sucked will be referred to a rear,<br>
and a side where compressed gas is discharged to a front), and operated<br>
according to pressure in the compression space (P) for opening or closing a<br>
suction flow (F) of gas; and a discharging valve 44 installed at a front of the<br>
cylinder 41 for opening or closing a discharge of the compressed gas.<br>
The frame unit 20 includes a first frame 21 mounted at front sides of<br>
the reciprocating motor 30 and the cylinder 41; a second frame connected<br>
with the first frame 21 for supporting the outer stator 31 of the reciprocating<br>

the piston 22 with the second frame 22.<br>
The resonant spring unit 50 includes a spring seat panel 51 disposed<br>
between the second frame 22 and the third frame 23, connected with the<br>
piston 42 to be linearly reciprocated; a first spring 52 disposed between the<br>

supported; and a first cylindrical portion 22b extended from an outer<br>
circumference of the first spring supporting portion 22a toward the third frame<br>
23.<br>
The third frame 23 includes a second cylindrical portion 23b receiving<br>

and a second spring supporting portion 23a extended from the rear side of<br>
the second cylindrical portion 23b inwardly so that an end of the second<br>
spring 53 is supported thereon.<br>
The second cylindrical portion 23b of the third frame 23 is fixed at the<br>
first cylindrical portion 22b of the second frame 22, so that an inner<br>
circumferential surface of the first cylindrical portion 22b and an outer<br>
circumferential surface of the second cylindrical portion 23b of the third frame<br>
23 are contacted to each other. An end of the first cylindrical portion 22b and<br>
the outer circumferential surface of the second cylindrical portion 23b are<br>
engaged to each other by welding (W) so that the second frame 22 and the<br>
third frame 23 can be coupled with each other. Herein, the second frame 22<br>
and the third frame 23 may be coupled with each other not by welding but by<br>
using a coupling means such as a volt or the like.<br>
On the other hand, the third frame 23 may not be fixed at the inside of<br>
the second frame, but the second frame 22 may be fixed at the inside of the<br>
third frame 23 by a press-fit, and, in this case, an end of the second<br>
cylindrical portion 23b of the third frame 23 and the outer circumferential<br>
surface of the first cylindrical portion 22b of the second frame 22 are<br>
engaged to each other by welding so that the second frame 22 and the third<br>
frame 23 can be coupled with each other.<br>
Assembling processes of the reciprocating compressor according to<br>
the present invention constructed as above, will now be described.<br>
First, the cylinder 41 is inserted and fixed at the first frame 21, and an<br>
inner stator 32 of the reciprocating motor 30 is fixed at an outer<br>
circumference of the cylinder 41.<br>
In a state that one side surface of the outer stator 31 disposed at a<br>
certain air gap between itself and an outer circumference of the inner stator<br>
32, the second frame 22 is adhered to another side surface of the outer<br>
stator 31, and the first and second frames 21 and 22 are fixed using a<br>
coupling means. In this manner, the reciprocating motor 30 is fixed between<br>
the first and second frames 21 and 22.<br>
And, the magnet paddle 33 coupled with the piston 42 and the spring<br>
seat panel 51 is inserted between the outer stator 31 and the inner stator 32<br>
so as to be linearly movable.<br>
At the spring seat panel 51, the first spring 52 and the second spring<br>
53 are mounted. The first spring 52 is adhered to a rear surface of the first<br>
spring supporting portion 22a of the second frame 22, and the second spring<br>
53 is adhered to a front surface of the second spring supporting portion 23a<br>
of the third frame 23.<br>
Then, an end of the second cylindrical portion 23b of the third frame<br>
23 is slidably inserted at the inner circumferential surface of the first<br>
cylindrical portion 22b of the second frame 22. Then, while the third frame 23<br>
is being moved in an axial direction of the piston 42, the first and second<br>
springs 52 and 53 are fittingly compressed, and an initial location of the<br>
piston 42 is fittingly adjusted. That is, as shown in FIG. 4, according to a<br>
location of the third frame 23, which has been moved, a location (L1, L2) is<br>
fittingly adjusted.<br>
Also, if the location of the piston 42 is optimized, the end of the first<br>
cylindrical portion 22b of the second frame 22 and the outer circumferential<br>
surface of the second cylindrical portion 23b of the third frame 23 are welded,<br>
thus to terminate assembling of the reciprocating compressor.<br>
In the reciprocating compressor, one of two frames, by which the<br>
resonant spring is supported, is movably inserted at the inside of another<br>
frame. With this movement of the frame, a location of the piston connected<br>
with the resonant spring is adjusted. Since an initial location of the piston can<br>
be readily adjusted in this manner, a fabrication process of the reciprocating<br>
compressor, and thus its productivity can be improved.<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications<br>
and variations can be made in the present invention without departing from<br>
the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present<br>
invention cover modifications and variations of this invention provided they<br>
come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.<br>
