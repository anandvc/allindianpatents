				<td>This invention relates to a novel catalytic process of preparation of unsaturated organic halides. Particularly, this invention relates to an improved catalytic process for the preparation of unsaturated halides of formula RX, where R represents alkenyl, alkynyl and aromatic groups using a hitherto unknown modification of classical Hunsdiecker reaction.<br>
Vinyl halides, acetylenic halides and aromatic halides are key building blocks of various drug intermediates and biologically important natural products. In 1861 Borodin and in 1942 Hunsdiecker demonstrated that silver carboxylates, when reacted with bromine at elevated temperature, undergoes facile bromodecarboxylation to afford the corresponding alkyl bromides (Borodin, B.; Liebigs Ann. 1861, 119, 121; Hunsdiecker, H.C. Chem. Ber. 1942, 75, 291). In the intervening years the reaction has been further modified to include carboxylates of Hg(ll), Pb(IV) and Tl(l) and molecular halogen or halide (Chrich, D. Comprehensive Organic Synthesis; Trost, B. M.; Steven, V.L.; Pergamon: Oxford, 1991, 7, 723-734). This halodecarboxylation reaction, recently renamed as Hunsdiecker-Borodin-Cristol-Firth reaction (Hassner, A.; Stumer, C.; Organic Syntheses based on Name and Unnamed Reactions; Pergamon: Oxford, 1994, 183) is of proven utility for the synthesis of various organic halides notably alkyl (1°,2°,30) and aryl halides.<br>
The major limitations in the above processes include: (a) necessity to use high temperature; (b) the toxicity/hazard related to molecular bromine and salts of Hg, Tl, Pb, Ag, (c) very poor yields in cases of substrates such as a,p-unsaturated carboxylic acids and (d) stringent ex-situ protocol of isolating and purifying carboxylates in certain cases.<br>
Furthermore, the art has not, heretofore, suggested or taught a reagent system that is capable of mediating the Hunsdiecker reaction in a catalytic fashion.<br>
The principal object of the present invention is to provide a catalytic process for the preparation of unsaturated haiides from the reaction of corresponding carboxylic acids with N-halosuccinimides in the presence of various catalysts in organic or organic-aqueous solvent systems. This novel protocol thereby utilizes a catalytic metal-salt or phase transfer reagent in mediating an one-pot Hunsdiecker reaction.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a novel catalytic process for the preparation of unsaturated organic haiides of formula RX where R represents alkenyl, alkynyl and aromatic groups, which comprises of reacting an organic unsaturated carboxylic acid of formula RCOOH wherein R is as stated above with N- haloacidimides in presence of a catalyst selected from group 1 metal salt or tetraalkyl ammonium salt of the kind such as herein described in halogenated solvent at ambient temperature for a period in the range of 25 wn to 24 h, recovering the unsaturated haiides of Formula RX by known methods wherein R is as stated above.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, unsaturated carboxylic acids used may be selected from alkyl or aryl substituted acrylic acid, alkyl or aryl substituted propiolic acid, alkyl or aryl substituted aromatic carboxylic acid.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, haloacidimides used may be selected from as N-bromosuccinimide, N-iodosuccinimide, N-chlorosuccinimide, N-bromophthalimide, N-iodophthalimide, N-Chlorophthalimide.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention the catalyst used may be group 1 metal salts or tetraalkylammonium salts.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the tetraalkylammonium salts used may be selected from tetrabutylammonium hydroxide, acetate, halide, trifluoroacetate. wherein<br>
tetraalkyl   group   may   be   such   as   tetramethyl,   tetraethyl,   tetrabutyl,   tetrabenzyl, trimethylbenzyl, triethylbenzyl, cetyltriethyl.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the group 1 metal salts used may be such as lithium acetate, sodium acetate, potassium acetate, cesium acetate.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the solvent used may be such as dichloromethane, dichloroethane, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, tetrachloroethane, acetonitrile-water.<br>
More specifically, the present reaction describes a process for the preparation of unsaturated chlorides, bromides or iodides by reacting unsaturated carboxylic acids with N-chloro, N-bromo or N-iodosuccinimides respectively in the presence of Groupl metal salts or tetraalkylammonium salts in various organic or organic-aqueous solvent systems. Among all the catalysts screened, lithium acetate and tetrabutylammonium trifluoroacetate provides the best result. This is exemplified for the reaction of cinnamic acid with N-bromosuccinimide in presence of various catalysts (Table 1 and Table 2).<br>

(Table Removed) <br>
Table 2:  Conversion of cinnamic acid to bromostyrene in presence of various solvent and tetraalkylammonium salts as catalysts<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
According to the present invention, the reaction of cinnamic acid (8 equiv.) with N-bromosuccinimide (11.5 equiv.) and tetrabutylammonium trifluoroacetate (1 equiv.) in dichloroethane (16 ml_) at ambient temperature for 6 h furnished after work-up p-bromostyrene in 73% isolated yield.. In contrast, uncatalysed reaction showed only 7-11%<br>
conversion. The methodology was extended to bromo, chloro and iododecarboxylation of various substituted cinnamic acids, propiolic acids and aromatic carboxylic acids as shown in Table 3, giving rise to good to excellent yields of corresponding halides. <br><br>

 (Table Removed) <br>
Unsaturated organic halides are of potential importance in the synthesis of commercially significant organic intermediates. As an example, this invention also presents a short synthesis of the natural product piperine, a chief component of pepper. The strategy comprises of coupling the catalytic Hunsdiecker reaction with conventional Heck reaction. Reaction of piperonyl acrylic acid with N-iodosuccinimide under the invented protocol afforded 2-piperonyl-1-iodo-ethene in 73% isolated yield, the latter was coupled with 1-acryloxy piperidine under Heck condition to afford piperine in 51% isolated yield. Tsuboi and coworkers (Tetrahedron Letters 1979, 1043) described the synthesis of piperine using steps comprising of (i) reaction of piperonal with acetylene/KOH to generate 3-piperonyl-prop-1-yne-3-ol (ii) reaction of the latter with (2,2'-diethoxy)-N-ethylpyrrolidine in refluxing benzene.<br>

The good to excellent yields of the products are noteworthy. The process also does not use toxic halogens such as molecular bromine or iodine.
