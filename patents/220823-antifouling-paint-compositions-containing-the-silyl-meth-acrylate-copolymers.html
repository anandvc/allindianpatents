ANTIFOULING PAINT COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THE SILYL (METH)<br>
ACRYLATE COPOLYMERS,<br>
CHUGOKU MARINE PAINTS, LTD., of 1-7, Meijishinkai, Ohtake-shi, Hiroshima 739-0652, Japan,<br>
The  following  specification  particularly  describes  the  nature  of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
1<br>
TITLE<br>
SILYL (METH)ACRYLATE COPOLYMERS, PROCESSES FOR PREPARING<br>
THE SAME, ANTIFOULING PAINT COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THE<br>
SILYL (METH)ACRYLATE COPOLYMERS, ANTIFOULING COATING<br>
5    FILMS FORMED FROM THE ANTIFOULING PAINT COMPOSITIONS,<br>
ANTIFOULING METHODS USING THE ANTIFOULING PAINT<br>
COMPOSITIONS, AND HULLS OR UNDERWATER STRUCTURES COATED<br>
WITH THE ANTIFOULING COATING FILMS<br>
10	TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to silyl (meth)acrylate copolymers, processes for preparing the same, antifouling paint compositions containing the silyl (meth)acrylate copolymers, antifouling coating films 15  formed from the antifouling paint compositions, antifouling methods using the antifouling paint compositions, and hulls or underwater structures coated with the coating films.<br>
More particularly, the invention relates to silyl 20  (meth)acrylate copolymers which can produce antifouling paints capable of forming antifouling coating films which hardly suffer from occurrence of cracks, have excellent adhesive strength and thereby hardly suffer from peeling, can be favorably controlled in the hydrolysis rate, and 25  are excellent in antifouling performance (antifouling activities), antifouling properties, particularly antifouling properties in a highly fouling environment,<br><br>
2<br>
and long-term antifouling properties. The invention also relates to processes for preparing such copolymers, antifouling paint compositions capable of forming antifouling coating films having the above properties, 5  antifouling coating films formed from the antifouling paint compositions, antifouling methods using the antifouling paint compositions, and hulls or underwater structures coated with the coating films.<br>
10	BACKGROUND ART<br>
Ships" bottoms, underwater structures, fishing nets, etc. sometimes have bad appearances and lose their functions, when they are exposed to water for a long time and various aquatic organisms, for example, animals such<br>
15  as oysters, hard-shell mussels and barnacles, plants such as laver, and aquatic bacteria adhere and propagate thereon.<br>
Especially when such aquatic organisms adhere and propagate on a ship"s bottom, the surface roughness of<br>
20  the whole ship may be increased to induce decrease of velocity of the ship or increase of fuel consumption. Further, removal of such aquatic organisms from the ship"s bottom needs much labor and a long period of working time.  In addition, if bacteria adhere and<br>
25  propagate on an underwater structure and slime (sludge¬like substance) further adheres thereto to bring about decomposition of the bacteria, or if large-sized<br><br>
3<br>
organisms adhere and propagate on an underwater structure such as a steel structure to damage anticorrosive coating films of the underwater structure, the strength or the function of the underwater structure may be lowered to 5  thereby extremely shorten the lifetime of the underwater structure.      <br>
In order to prevent such problems, ships" bottoms have been hitherto coated with antifouling paints of excellent antifouling properties, for example, a paint<br>
10  containing a copolymer of tributyltin methacrylate and methyl methacrylate or the like and cuprous oxide (CU2O). The copolymer contained in this antifouling paint is hydrolyzed in seawater to release an organotin compound such as bistributyltin oxide (tributyltin ether, Bu3Sn-0-<br>
15  SnBu3 (Bu: butyl group)) or tributyltin halide (Bu3SnX (X: halogen atom)) and exerts an antifouling effect, and besides the hydrolyzed copolymer itself becomes water-soluble and is dissolved in seawater. That is, this antifouling paint is a "hydrolyzable self-polishing<br>
20  paint", so that no resin residue remains on the coated surface of the ship"s bottom, and the surface can be always kept active.<br>
Such organotin compounds, however, are strongly toxic, and there are fears of marine pollution,<br>
25 occurrence of malformed fish or malformed shellfish and evil influences on the biosystem due to the food chain. For this reason, development of tin-free antifouling<br><br>
4<br>
paints substitutable for the conventional paints has been desired.<br>
The tin-free antifouling paints are, for example, silyl ester antifouling paints described in (1) Japanese 5  Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 264170/1992, (2)<br>
Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 264169/1992 and (3) Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 264168/1992. These antifouling paints, however, have problems of poor antifouling properties and occurrence of cracking or<br>
10  peeling, as taught by (4) Japanese Patent Laid-Open<br>
Publication No. 157941/1994 and (5) Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 157940/1994.<br>
In (6) Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 196869/1990, an antifouling paint containing a chemically<br>
15  modified acid functional copolymer (A), which is obtained by copolymerizing trimethylsilyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate and methoxyethyl acrylate in the presence of an azo polymerization initiator and contains a carboxylic acid group blocked by a trimethylsilyl group, and a<br>
20  compound (B) of a polyvalent cation is taught.  This<br>
antifouling paint, however, has a problem that a coating film obtained from the antifouling paint is not satisfactory in the crack resistance.<br>
In (7) National Publication No. 500452/1985 of<br>
25  International Patent Application and Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 215780/1988, a resin for an antifouling paint, which is obtained by copolymerizing a<br><br>
5<br>
vinyl monomer having an organosilyl group such as a trialkylsilyl ester of (meth)acrylic acid with another vinyl monomer and has a number-average molecular weight of 3,000 to 40,000, is described.  It is also described 5  that an organic water binder such as trimethyl<br>
orthoformate, an antifouling agent such as cuprous oxide and a pigment such as red iron oxide can be further added. This resin for an antifouling paint, however, has problems that the resin is liable to be gelatinized when<br>
10  stored and a coating film formed from the antifouling paint has poor crack resistance and peel resistance, as described in (5) Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 157940/1994.<br>
In Japanese patent Publication No. 32433/1993<br>
15  corresponding to the above-mentioned publication (7)<br>
(National Publication No. 500452/1985 of International Patent Application), an antifouling paint comprising (a) a toxic substance and (b) a polymer binder which has a recurring unit represented by  the formula (-CH2-CXCOOR)-<br>
20  (B)- (X is H or CH3, R is SiR"3 or Si(OR")3, R" is an<br>
alkyl group or the like, and B is a residual group of an ethylenically unsaturated monomer) and has a specific hydrolysis rate is disclosed.  It is also described that a solvent, a water-sensitive pigment component, an inert<br>
25  pigment, a fillet and a retarder can be further introduced. The coating film obtained from the<br><br>
6<br>
antifouling paint described in this publication, however, has a problem of poor crack resistance.<br>
In (8) Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 18216/1995, there is disclosed a paint composition which 5  contains, as its major components, (A) a polymer of an organosilicon-containing monomer A having an organosilicon triester group represented by the formula (I) -COO-SiR1R2R3 (R1 to R3 are each an alkyl group of 1 to 18 carbon atoms or the like) in a molecule and (B) 10  copper or a copper compound and further contains, as an<br>
essential component other than the components (A) and (B), an alkoxy group-containing silicon compound represented by the following formula (C):<br><br>
15<br>
wherein R4 to R6 are each a hydrogen atom, an alkoxy group of 1 to 18 carbon atoms, a cycloalkoxy group or the like, R7 is an alkyl group of 1 to 18 carbon atoms or the like, and n is an integer of 1 to 3. 20      In the above publication, it is also described that a copolymer AB of the monomer A having a group represented by the formula (I) and a vinyl monomer B copolymerizable with the monomer A may be contained. Further, (meth)acrylic esters such as methyl<br><br>
7<br>
(meth)acrylate, ethyl (meth)acrylate and dimethylaminoethyl (meth)acrylate are given as examples of the monomer B.<br>
The coating film obtained from the paint composition 5  described in the above publication, however, has a problem that a coa-ting film obtained from the paint composition is poor in the crack resistance and the antifouling properties, particularly antifouling properties in a highly fouling environment. The term<br>
10  "highly fouling environment" indicates, for example, a sea area rich in nutritive such as inland sea or a state where a ship or structure is allowed to stand in such a sea area or a ship frequently repeats running and stopping or runs at a low rate, e.g., about 10 knots or<br>
15  lower.<br>
In (9) Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 102193/1995, there is disclosed a paint composition containing, as its essential components, a copolymer of a monomer mixture consisting of a monomer A represented by<br>
20  the formula X-SiR1R2R3 (R1 to R3 are each a group selected from an alkyl group and an aryl group and may be the same or different, and X is an acryloyloxy group, a methacryloyloxy group, a malenoyloxy group or a fumaroyloxy group) and a monomer B represented by the<br>
25  formula Y-(CH2CH20)n-R4 (R4 is an alkyl group or an aryl group, Y is an acryloyloxy group or a methacryloyloxy group, and n is an integer of 1 to 25), and an<br><br>

antifouling agent.  Further, inorganic compounds such as copper compounds (specifically, cuprous oxide and copper powder), zinc sulfate and zinc oxide, and metal-containing organic compounds such as organocopper 5  compounds (specifically, oxine copper), organonickel compounds and organozinc compounds (specifically, zinc pyrithione) are given as examples of the antifouling agents.  In this publication, however, neither an organosilyl ester group-containing polymer using 2-<br>
10  hydroxyethyl acrylate or the like nor an organosilyl<br>
ester group-containing polymer having both of a straight-chain alkyl group-containing silyl (meth)acrylate constituent unit and a branched alkyl group-containing silyl (meth)acrylate constituent unit is mentioned.  In<br>
15  addition, the paint described in this publication is poor in the antifouling properties or the antifouling properties in a highly fouling environment.<br>

25  alkyl group, R5 is an alkyl group or a cycloalkyl group, and Y is an acryloyloxy group, a methacryloyloxy group, a maleinoyloxy group or a fumaroyloxy group), and if<br><br>
9<br>
necessary, a vinyl monomer C copolymerizable with the monomers A and B, and an antifouling agent. Further, acrylic esters, methacrylic esters, styrene and vinyl acetate are described as examples of the vinyl monomers 5  C; and inorganic compounds such as copper compounds (specifically, cupcous oxide and copper powder), zinc sulfate and zinc oxide, and metal-containing organic compounds such as organocopper compounds (specifically, oxine copper), organonickel compounds and organozinc<br>
10  compounds (specifically, zinc pyrithione) are given as examples of the antifouling agents.<br>
In (11) Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 269388/1996, there is disclosed a paint composition containing, as its essential components, a copolymer of a<br>
15  monomer mixture consisting of a monomer A represented by the formula (1) X-SiR1R2R3 (R1 to R3 are each a hydrocarbon group of 1 to 20 carbon atoms and may be the same or different, and X is an acryloyloxy group, a methacryloyloxy group, a malenoyloxy group, a fumaroyloxy<br>
20  group or an itaconoyloxy group) and a monomer B<br>
represented by the formula (2) Y-(CH2CH20) n-R4 (R4 is an alkyl group or an aryl group, Y is an acryloyloxy group, a methacryloyloxy group, a maleinoyloxy group, a fumaroyloxy group or an itaconoyloxy group, and n is an<br>

59<br>
invention is described below. The copper and/or the copper compound used herein has a molecular weight of usually 63.5 to 2,000, preferably 63.5 to 1,000.<br>
The copper compound (B-l) may be any of organic type and inorganic type. Examples of inorganic copper compounds (B-3) include cuprous oxide, copper thiocyanate (cuprous thiocyanate, copper rhodanide), basic copper sulfate, copper chloride and copper oxide. Examples of organic copper compounds include basic copper acetate, oxine copper, copper nonylphenolsulfonate, copper bis(ethylenediamine)-bis(dodecylbenzenesulfonate), copper naphthenate, copper rosinate and copper bis(pentachlorophenolate).

Such copper compounds can be used singly or in combination of two or more kinds, with or without copper.<br>
The copper and/or the copper compound is desirably contained in the antifouling paint composition (P), (Q) or (R) of the invention in the total amount of usually 1 to 70 % by weight, preferably 3 to 65 % by weight. Further, based on 100 parts by weight of the silyl (meth)acrylate copolymer (A-l) or (A-2) contained in the antifouling paint composition, the copper and/or the copper compound   (B-l)   is desirably contained in  the  total amount of usually 3 to 1,400 parts by weight, preferably 10 to 1,300 parts by weight.<br><br>
60<br>
When the copper and/or the copper compound is contained in the antifouling paint composition (P), (Q) or (R) in the amount mentioned above, the paint composition tends to have excellent antifouling 5  properties.<br>
In the present invention, an organic antifouling agent (B-4) is preferably used together with the copper and/or the copper compound (B-l) (particularly copper and/or inorganic copper compound (B-3) in the antifouling 10  paint composition (R)) or in place of the copper and/or the copper compound. The organic antifouling agent is, for example, a pyrithione compound (B-2) represented by the following formula (VI) (i.e., metal pyrithione).<br><br>
15	...(VI)<br>
wherein R21 to R24 are each independently hydrogen, an alkyl group, an alkoxy group, a halogenated alkyl group, M is a metal such as Zn, Cu, Na, Mg, Ca, Ba, Pb, Fe or Al, 20  and n is a valence of the metal.<br>
The pyrithione compound(s) (B-2) are desirably contained in the antifouling paint composition (P), (Q)<br><br>
61<br>
or (R) in the (total) amount of usually 0.1 to 15 % by weight, preferably 0.5 to 10 % by weight.  Further, based on 100 parts by weight of the silyl (meth)acrylate copolymer (A-l) or (A-2) contained in the antifouling 5  paint composition (P), (Q) or (R), the pyrithione<br>
compound(s) (B-2) ,&amp;re desirably contained in the (total) amount of usually 0.3 to 300 parts by weight, preferably 2 to 200 parts by weight.<br>
In the present invention, the following antifouling<br>
10  agents (other antifouling agents) may be contained<br>
together with the pyrithione compound (B-2) or in place of the pyrithione compound. As the other antifouling agents, those hitherto known can be widely used, and examples thereof include tetramethylthiuram disulfide,<br>
15  carbamate type compounds such as zinc<br>
dimethyldithiocarbamate and manganese 2-ethylenebis-dithiocarbamate, 2,4,5,6-tetrachloroisophthalonitrile, N,N-dimethyldichlorophenylurea, 2-methylthio-4-tert-butylamino-6-cyclopropylamino-s-triazine, 4,5-dichloro-2-<br>

trichlorophenylmaleimide, pyridine-triphenylborane and amine-triphenylborane.<br>
In the present invention, such antifouling agents can be used singly or in combination of two or more kinds,<br>
25  together with the pyrithione compound (metal pyrithione) such as zinc pyrithione (corresponding to a compound of the above formula (VI) wherein R21 to R24 are each H, M is<br><br>
62<br>
Zn, and N is 2) or copper pyrithione (corresponding to a compound of the above formula (VI) wherein R21 to R24 are each H, M is Cu, and N is 2). For example, copper pyrithione and/or zinc pyrithione can be used in 5  combination with 4,5-dichloro-2-n-octyl-4-isothiazoline-3-one.<br>
The amounts of various antifouling agents such as the copper and/or the copper compound (B-l) and the pyrithione compound (B-2) contained in the antifouling<br>
10  paint composition (P), (Q) or (R) depend upon the types of the antifouling agents and the film-forming copolymer used in the preparation of the antifouling paint composition and the types of hulls (e.g., for ocean or coastal area, for various sea areas, made of wood or<br>
15  steel) to be coated with the antifouling paint<br>
composition, and cannot be determined discriminatingly. However, the total amount thereof is desired to be in the range of usually 10 to 1,400 parts by weight, preferably 20 to 1,300 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight<br>
20  of the silyl (meth)acrylate copolymer (A-l) or (A-2). If the total amount of the antifouling agents is less than 10 parts by weight, the antifouling paint composition sometimes has poor antifouling properties. Even if the total amount thereof exceeds 1,400 parts by<br>
25  weight, antifouling properties higher than a certain extent cannot be expected, and besides the crack resistance may become poor.<br><br>
63<br>
When zinc pyrithione and cuprous oxide (CU2O) are used in combination as the antifouling agents of the antifouling paint composition (P), zinc pyrithione may be contained in an amount of 2 to 200 parts by weight based 5  on 100 parts by weight of the silyl (meth)acrylate copolymer, and cuprous oxide may be contained in an amount of usually about 10 to 1,300 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the silyl (meth)acrylate copolymer. Even if zinc pyrithione and cuprous oxide are<br>
10  contained in combination as described above, the<br>
antifouling paint composition has excellent storage stability and is neither thickened nor gelatinized when stored, differently from the aforesaid conventional antifouling paints.<br>
15      When copper pyrithione and cuprous oxide (CU2O) are used in combination as the antifouling agents of the antifouling paint composition (Q) or (R), copper pyrithione may be contained in an amount of 2 to 200 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the silyl<br>
20  (meth)acrylate copolymer (A-l) or (A-2), and cuprous<br>
oxide may be contained in an amount of usually about 10 to 1,300 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the silyl (meth)acrylate copolymer (A-l) or (A-2).<br>
Zinc oxide (zinc white)	LCI<br>
25       In the antifouling paint composition (P), (Q) or (R) of the invention, zinc oxide (zinc white) (C) may be contained. By the use of the antifouling paint<br><br>
64<br>
composition containing zinc oxide, the strength of the resulting coating film can be enhanced and the polishing-cleaning properties thereof can be effectively controlled. The zinc oxide is desirably contained in the 5  antifouling paint composition in an amount of usually 0.5 to 35 % by weight, .preferably 1 to 25 % by weight, from the viewpoints of adjustments of degree of consumption and hardness of the coating film.<br>
Dehydrating agent 10      In the antifouling paint composition (P), (Q) or (R) of the invention, a dehydrating agent of inorganic type or organic type, preferably a dehydrating agent of inorganic type (inorganic dehydrating agent (D)), may be contained.  By introducing the dehydrating agent into the 15  antifouling paint composition, the storage stability of the paint composition can be much more enhanced.<br>
Examples of the dehydrating agents include anhydrous gypsum (CaS04) , synthetic zeolite type adsorbents (e.g.,<br>
trade name: Molecular Sieves), orthoesters such as methyl 20  orthoformate and methyl orthoacetate, orthoboric esters,<br>
silicates and isocyanates (e.g., trade name: Additive Tl).<br>
Particularly, anhydrous gypsum or Molecular Sieves is<br>
preferably used as the inorganic dehydrating agent (D).<br>
Such inorganic dehydrating agents can be used singly or 25  in combination of two or more kinds.<br>
The dehydrating agent, particularly inorganic<br>
dehydrating agent, is desirably added in an amount of<br><br>
65<br>
usually 0.02 to 100 parts by weight, preferably 0.2 to 50 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the silyl(meth)acrylate copolymer (A-l) or (A-2).<br>
The inorganic dehydrating agent(s) are desirably 5  contained in the antifouling paint composition (P), (Q) or (R) in the (total) amount of usually 0.01 to 10 % by weight, preferably 0.1 to 5 % by weight.  If the inorganic dehydrating agent is contained in the antifouling paint composition in this amount, the storage 10  stability of the paint composition tends to be enhanced.<br>
Vinyl ether (co)polymer (El The vinyl ether (co)polymer (E) for use in the invention is a (co)polymer containing constituent units derived from a vinyl ether represented by the following 15  formula (V):<br>
H2C=CHO-R	(V)<br>

20  is, for example, an aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon group usually having 1 to 25 carbon atoms, and the hydrocarbon group may be straight-chain or branched or may have an alicyclic structure such as a cyclohexyl ring. The carbon atom C1 for constituting the hydrocarbon group<br>
25  (having 2 carbon atoms or more) may form, together with the carbon atom C2 contained in the alkyl group and adjacent to the carbon atom C1, an ether linkage (C1-0-C2)<br><br>
66<br>
through an oxygen atom. The hydrogen atoms for constituting the hydrocarbon group may be replaced with other functional groups (e.g., -OH, -NH2) .<br>
More specifically, R in the formula (V) is a 5  monovalent hydrocarbon group, and examples of the<br>
monovalent hydrocarbon groups include an alkyl group and a phenyl group which may have a substituent group.<br>
The vinyl ether (co)polymer (E) desirably is a homopolymer of a vinyl ether represented by the formula 10  (V) or a vinyl ether copolymer containing as its major component the vinyl ether (V) in an amount of not less than 50 % by weight (both polymers are sometimes generically referred to as "vinyl ether (co)polymer").<br>
Examples of the vinyl ether (co)polymers include 15  polyvinyl methyl ether, polyvinyl ethyl ether, polyvinyl isopropyl ether and polyvinyl isobutyl ether.<br>
In the antifouling paint composition, the vinyl ether (co)polymer(s) are desirably contained in the (total) amount of usually 0.1 to 10 % by weight, 20  preferably 0.2 to 5 % by weight.  Further, based on 100 parts by weight of the silyl (meth)acrylate copolymer contained in the antifouling paint composition, the vinyl ether (co)polymer(s) are desirably contained in the (total) amount of usually 0.3 to 60 parts by weight, 25  preferably 0.6 to 40 parts by weight.<br>
When the vinyl ether (co)polymer is contained in the antifouling paint composition in the amount mentioned<br><br>
67<br>
above, antifouling properties, crack resistance, peel resistance and elution rate stability of the resulting coating film tend to become excellent.<br>
Elution accelerating component (F) 5      The elution accelerating component (F) for use in the invention has  a function of accelerating self polishing of the coating film in seawater. Examples of the elution accelerating components include rosin (e.g., trade name: Rosin WW), derivatives thereof,<br>
10  monocarboxylic acids and salts thereof.<br>
Examples of rosin include gum rosin, wood rosin and tall oil rosin, and any of them is employable in the invention. Examples of the rosin derivatives include disproportinated rosin, low-melting disproportionated<br>
15  rosin, hydrogenated rosin, polymerized rosin, maleic acid-modified rosin, aldehyde-modified rosin, polyoxyalkylene ester of rosin, reduced rosin (rosin alcohol), metallic salts of rosin and rosin derivatives (e.g., copper salt, zinc salt and magnesium salt of rosin<br>
20 and rosin derivatives), and rosin amine. These rosin and rosin derivatives can be used singly or in combination of two or more kinds.<br>
Examples of the monocarboxylic acids include fatty acids having about 5 to 30 carbon atoms, synthetic fatty<br>
25  acids and naphthenic acid. Examples of the salts of<br>
monocarboxylic acids include Cu salt, Zn salt, Mg salt and Ca salt of monocarboxylic acids. Of these elution<br><br>
68<br>
accelerating components, rosin, rosin derivatives and metallic salts of naphthenic acid are preferable. Such elution accelerating components can be used singly or in combination of two or more kinds. In the antifouling 5  paint composition, the elution accelerating component(s) are desirably contained in the (total) amount of 0.1 to 30 % by weight, preferably 0.1 to 20 % by weight, more preferably 0.5 to 15 % by weight, in terms of solid content. The proportion of the elution accelerating<br>
10  component(s) is desired to be in this range from the viewpoints of antifouling performance and water resistance of the coating film.<br>
Further, based on 100 parts by weight of the silyl (meth)acrylate copolymer contained in the antifouling<br>
15 paint composition, the elution accelerating component(s) are desirably contained in the (total) amount of usually 0.3 to 600 parts by weight, preferably 2 to 300 parts by weight.<br>
When the amount of the elution accelerating<br>
20  component contained in the antifouling paint composition is in the above range, antifouling properties and degree of consumption of the resulting coating film tend to become excellent.<br>
Anti-saaaina anti-settlina aaent<br>

By the use of a pigment in needle, flat or scaly form, the crack resistance of the coating film can be 20  much more enhanced.<br>
As the solvent, any of various solvents which are<br>
generally added to antifouling paints, such as those of<br>
aliphatic type, aromatic type (e.g., xylene, toluene),<br>

Polymer Preparation Example Preparation of silyl fmethlacrylate copolymer (A-11 5      A reactor equipped with a stirrer, a condenser, a thermometer, a dropping device, a nitrogen feed pipe and a heating/cooling jacket was charged with 100 parts of xylene, and the xylene was stirred under heating at a temperature of 85°C in a stream of nitrogen. With<br>
10  maintaining the same temperature, a mixture of 50 parts of triisopropylsilyl acrylate, 45 parts of methyl methacrylate, 5 parts of 2-hydroxypropyl acrylate and 1 part of 2,2"-azobisisobutyronitrile (polymerization initiator) was dropwise added to the reactor over a<br>
15  period of 2 hours by means of the dropping device. After the reaction solution was stirred for 4 hours at the same temperature, 0.4 part of 2,2"-azobisisobutyronitrile was added, and the mixture was further stirred for 4 hours at the same temperature to obtain a colorless transparent<br>
20  solution of a silyl (meth)acrylate copolymer (Al-1).<br>
The thus obtained solution of the copolymer (Al-1) had a heating residue (after drying for 3 hours in a constant temperature vessel at 105°C) of 50.9 %, a viscosity at 25°C of 353 cps, a number-average molecular<br>

To prepare antifouling paint compositions having 20  formulations shown in Tables 8 to 11 (Examples Pi to P29), Tables 12 to 18 (Examples Ql to Q52, Comparative Examples PQ1 to PQ5) and Tables 19 to 21 (Examples Rl to R23, Comparative Examples Rl to R5), the ingredients were shaken all together for 2 hours in a paint shaker 25  containing glass beads and then filtered through a 100-mesh filter.  Thus, the desired antifouling paint compositions were obtained.<br><br>
79<br>
The antifouling paint compositions were stored for 2 months at ordinary temperature to evaluate storage stability. The results are set forth in Tables 8 to 21.<br>
In the evaluation of storage stability, a viscosity 5  (Ku value measured at 25°C by a Stormer"s viscometer) of each antifouling paint composition was measured immediately after the preparation and after storage at ordinary temperature for 2 months, and the storage viscosity was evaluated by the increase in viscosity. 10  Evaluation r-ritpria<br>
5: An increase in viscosity is less than 10.<br>
4: An increase in viscosity is less than 20.<br>
3: An increase in viscosity is less than 30.<br>
2: An increase in viscosity is not less than 30. 15      1: A Ku value is unmeasurable because of no flowability.<br>
Antifouling properties and degree of consumption of a coating film formed from each antifouling paint, composition were evaluated in the manner described below. 20      The results are set forth in Tables 8 to 21, in which the examples and the comparative examples to prepare antifouling paint compositions are referred to as• "Ex." and "Comp Ex." for short). Evaluation of antifouling properties 25      A sandblasted steel plate of 70 x 200 x 3 mm was<br>
bent so as to be fitted onto the side of a rotating drum placed in seawater in Hiroshima Bay.<br><br>
80<br>
The sandblasted steel plate was coated with an epoxy type zinc-rich primer, further with an epoxy type anticorrosive paint next day, and furthermore a vinyl type binder coat two days after, to form coating films 5  superposed in this order and having dry film thicknesses of 20 um, 15 urn an«l 50 um, respectively. Thereafter, the antifouling paint composition under test was applied in such an amount that the film thickness after dried would be 200 um, to obtain a test plate. The test plate was<br>
10  fitted onto the rotating drum, and a test was carried out at a peripheral speed of 5 knots under 50 % working conditions (alternation of 12-hour working at night and 12-hour rest in the day time) for 12 months in a highly fouling environment, to evaluate antifouling properties.<br>
15       In the evaluation of antifouling properties, the<br>
surface of the coating film was visually observed and the antifouling properties were evaluated based on the following criteria. Evaluation criteria<br>
20      5: Any substance sticking to the surface of the coating film is not observed.<br>
4: Slime(biofilm) thinly sticking to the surface of the coating film is observed.<br>
3: Slime thickly sticking to the surface of the<br>
25  coating film is observed.<br><br>
81<br>
2: Slime sticking to the surface of the coating film and plants such as ectocarpales sticking partly to the surface thereof are observed.<br>
1: The whole surface of the coating film is covered 5  with plants such as ectocarpales.<br>
The degree of*consumption was evaluated under the following conditions. Evaluation of degree of consumption<br>
A disc-shaped sandblasted steel plate having a<br>
10  diameter of 300 mm and a thickness of 3 mm was coated with an epoxy type zinc-rich primer, further with an epoxy type anticorrosive paint next day, and furthermore a vinyl type binder coat two days after, in such amounts that thicknesses of the coating films superposed in this<br>
15  order would become 20 um, 15 um and 50 um, respectively, followed by drying indoors for 7 days. Thereafter, the antifouling paint composition under test was applied radially from the disc center using an applicator having a gap of 500 um, to obtain a test plate.<br>
20      The test plate was fitted onto a motor and placed in a constant temperature bath containing seawater at 25°C. The motor was rotated at a peripheral speed of 15 knots for 1 month in Examples P1 to P29, Examples Ql to Q52 and Comparative Examples PQ1 to PQ5 (Tables 8 to 18) and at a<br>
25  peripheral speed of 15 knots for 2 months in Examples Rl to R23 and Comparative Examples Rl to R5 (Tables 19 to<br><br>
82<br>
21), to evaluate degree of consumption (decrease in film thickness) near the periphery.<br>
The results of the evaluation are set forth in Tables 8 to 21, 5      Further, the condition of the coating film was<br>
visually observed in the measurement of decrease in film thickness and evaluated based on the following criteria. Evaluation criteria<br>
5: The coating film has nothing unusual. 10      4: Fine cracks are observed on a part of the surface of the coating film.<br>
3: Fine cracks are observed on the whole surface of the coating film.<br>
