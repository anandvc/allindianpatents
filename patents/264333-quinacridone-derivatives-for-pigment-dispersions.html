				<td>Description<br>
QUINACRIDONE DERIVATIVES FOR PIGMENT DISPERSIONS<br>
Technical field<br>
[0001]   The present invention relates to a quinacridone derivative and stable pigment dispersions, especially Inkjet inks, using the quinacridone derivative.<br>
Background art<br>
[0002]   Pigment dispersions are made using a dispersant. A dispersant is a<br>
substance for promoting the formation and stabilization of a dispersion of pigment particles in a dispersion medium. Dispersants are generally surface-active materials having an anionic, cationic or non-ionic structure. The presence of a dispersant substantially reduces the dispersing energy required. Dispersed pigment particles may have a tendency to re-agglomerate after the dispersing operation, due to mutual attraction forces. The use of dispersants also counteracts this re-agglomeration tendency of the pigment particles.<br>
[0003]   The dispersant has to meet particularly high requirements when used for Inkjet inks. Inadequate dispersing manifests itself as increased viscosity in liquid systems, loss of brilliance and/or hue shifts. Moreover, particularly • good dispersion of the pigment particles is required to ensure unimpeded passage of the pigment particles through the nozzles of the print head in an Inkjet printer, which are usually only a few micrometers in diameter. In addition, pigment particle agglomeration and the associated blockage of the printer nozzles has to be avoided in the standby periods of the printer.<br>
[0004]   Many polymeric dispersants contain in one part of the molecule so-called anchor groups, which adsorb onto the pigments to be dispersed. In a spatially separate part of the molecule, polymeric dispersants have polymer chains sticking out whereby pigment particles are made compatible with the dispersion medium, i.e. stabilized.<br>
[0005]   In aqueous Inkjet inks, the polymeric dispersants generally contain hydrophobic anchor groups exhibiting a high affinity for the pigment surface and hydrophliic polymer chains for stabilizing the pigments in the aqueous dispersion medium.<br><br>
[0006]  The preparation of good thermally stable dispersions with submicron particles is more difficult for non-aqueous Inkjet inks, such as solvent based, oil based and radiation curable Inkjet inks. The pigments are especially difficult to disperse when they have a non-polar surface.<br>
[0007]   These problems have lead to the design of very specific polymeric dispersants wherein the anchor groups are pigment derivatives. For example, EP 0763378 A (TOYO INK) discloses a pigment composition comprising a non-aqueous type pigment dispersing agent having a portion which has a high affinity with a pigment and which has at least one type selected from the group consisting of an organic dye, anthraqulnone and acridone only at a terminal end or at both terminal ends of at least one polymer selected from a linear urethane polymer and a linear acrylic polymer, and a pigment.<br>
[0008]   Another approach for dispersing pigments with non-polar surfaces in non¬aqueous dispersion media is changing the surface to a more polar surface by addition of compounds known as dispersion synergists. A dispersion synergist is a compound that promotes the adsorption of the polymeric dispersant on the surface of the pigment. It is suggested that the synergist should possess the pigment structure substituted by one or more sulphonic acid groups or ammonium salts thereof.<br>
[0009]    US 4461647 (ICI) discloses a dispersion of a pigment in an organic liquid containing a water-insoluble asymmetric disavow compound comprising a central divalent group free from acidic and other ionic substituents linked through ago groups to two monovalent end groups characterized in that one end group, the first, is free from acidic and other ionic substituents and the other end group, the second, carries a single substituted ammonium-acid salt group.<br>
[0010]    US 4057436 (ICI) discloses pigment dispersions in organic liquids using polymeric or resinous dispersing agents in the presence of a substituted ammonium salt of a colored acid wherein there are between 15 and 60 carbon atoms contained in at least 3 chains attached to the N-atom of the substituted ammonium ion.<br><br>
[0011]    US 6641655 (AVECIA) discloses the use of a diquaternary ammonium salt of a coloured acid as fluidising agent wherein the diquaternary ammonium cation contains two or more nitrogen atoms.<br>
[0012]   Although these dispersion synergists work fine for some pigments, many other pigments can not be dispersed to an acceptable quality in a non¬aqueous medium. This is the case for quinacridone pigments, for which it is difficult to obtain stable non-aqueous pigment dispersions, especially stable non-aqueous Inkjet inks.<br>
[0013]   Sulfonated quinacridone derivatives have been disclosed, for example, by US 6152968 (BASF) . However, US 6152968 (BASF) is silent on their use in non-aqueous media.<br>
[0014]    US 6827775 (CIBA SPECIALTY CHEMICALS) discloses the use of a pigment and its sulfonation product in a solid solution, water and organic solvents such as xylene. However, US 6827775 (CIBA SPECIALTY CHEMICALS) is silent on the stability of non-aqueous dispersions of quinacridone type pigments and their sulfonation products.<br>
[0015]    US 4844742 (CiBA GEfGY) discloses the surface modification of<br>
quinacridone pigments, wherein the pigment is treated with a solvent-free, basic, nitrogen-containing copolymer of the polyurethane series and with a dispersion-improving quinacridone derivative resulting in compositions exhibiting enhanced performance in automotive and other finish systems. The derivatives used are phthalimidomethyl or sulfonic acid derivatives of quinacridone. Again no details are given on the stability of non-aqueous dispersions of quinacridone type pigments.<br>
[0016]    WO 02/064680 (CLARIANT) discloses quinachdone derivatives<br>
comprising sulfonic acid and carboxylic acid groups used as pigment dispersants in aqueous and non-aqueous Inkjet inks and in hotmelt Inkjet inks. Radiation curable Inkjet inks are not disclosed<br>
[0017]    DE 1619618 (DU PONT) discloses quinacridone pigments comprising upto 25 wt% of quinacridone derivatives comprising carboxylic acid groups. Pigment dispersions using the quinacridone derivatives are not disclosed.<br><br>
[0018]    US 20050196697 (KONICA MINOLTA) discloses actinic ray curable compositions containing a quinacridone pigment; a dispersant; a cationically potymerizable monomer; a photo acid generator; and a quinacridone derivative. The exemplified quinacridone derivatives comprise sulfonamido groups.<br>
[0019]    US 6451103 (TOYO INK) discloses self-dispersible aqueous pigment dispersions of quinacridone pigments with water-soluble pigment derivatives comprising one or more groups having a carboxylic acid or sulfonic acid or salts thereof. Non-aqueous pigment dispersions are not disclosed.<br>
[0020]   For consistent image quality, Inkjet inks require a dispersion stability<br>
capable of dealing with high temperatures (above 60°C) during transport Of the ink to a customer, jetting at elevated temperatures and changes in the dispersion medium of the Inkjet ink during use, for example, evaporation of solvent and increasing concentrations of humectants, penetrants and other additives.<br>
[0021] Therefore, it is highly desirable to be able to manufacture pigment Inkjet inks using quinacridone pigments in a non-aqueous medium exhibiting a high dispersion quality and stability.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
[0022]   It is an object of the present invention to provide a novel quinacridone derivative.<br>
[0023]   It is a further object of the present invention to provide non-aqueous quinacridone dispersions with high dispersion quality and stability.<br>
[0024]   Further objects of the invention will become apparent from the descnption hereinafter.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
[0025]   It has been surprisingly found that non-aqueous pigment dispersions of high dispersion quality and stability were obtained by using a specific dichloro substituted quinacridone derivative containing two carboxylic acid groups as dispersion synergist, whereas quinacridone derivatives containing only one carboxylic acid group or sulfonic acid groups failed.<br><br>
[0026]   Objects of the present invention have been realized with a quinacridone derivative according to Formula (I):<br><br>
wherein R^ and R2 are each Independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, afkyi and halogen. [0027]   Objects of the present invention have also been realized with a method for forming a pigment dispersion comprising the steps of:<br>

(b)	transforming at least one carboxylic acid group of the quinacridone derivative into a salt group; and<br><br>
(c) mixing the quinacridone derivative with a pigment in a dispersion<br>
medium. [0051]   In case that the dispersion synergist contains a salt of a carboxyiic acid<br>
group, the charge of the carboxylate anion is compensated by a cation. [0052]   The cation may be an inorganic cation selected from the group consisting<br>
of the la and lla metals in the table of Mendeleyev. In a preferred<br>
embodiment the cation is Li*. [0053]   The cation may also be an organic cation. A preferred cation is an<br>
ammonium and a substituted ammonium group. [0054]   In a preferred embodiment the cation is selected from the substituted<br>
ammonium cations disclosed in US 4461647 (ICI), US 4057436 (ICI) and<br>
US 6641655 (AVECIA) incorporated herein by reference. [0055]   Particularly preferred cations include the substituted-ammonium groups<br>
selected from the group consisting of ■'N(CH3)2(Ci8H37)2,<br>
*NH(CH3)2(Cl8H37), *N(CH3)2(C12H25)2, *NH(CH3)2(Cl2H25), *N(CH3)2(CloH2l)2, "NH(CH3)2(CloH2l), *N(CH3)2(C8Hl7)2.<br>
*NH(CH3)2(C8Hi7). "NH(C8Hi7)3,"NH(CioH2i)3,*NH(Ci2H25)3and<br>
*NH(Cl8H35)3.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
[0057]   The substituted ammonium group is cinemically represented in Table 1 as an amine with the hydrogen attached to the carboxylate anion. The cation can be used in any desired molar ratio to the quinacridinone derivative, but preferably the molar ratio of cation to quinacridone derivative is between<br>
1:1 to 2:1.<br>
[0058]   The quinacridone derivative is preferably added in an amount between 0.1 and 20 wt% based upon the weight of the pigment.<br>
[0059]   The synergist should be additional to the amount of polymeric<br>
dispersant(s). The ratio of polymeric dispersant/dispersion synergist depends upon the pigment and should be determined experimentally. Typically the ratio wt% polymeric dispersant/wt% dispersion synergist is selected between 2:1 to 1000:1, preferably between 2:1 and 100:1.<br>
Pigment dispersions and Inkjet inks<br>
[0060] A non-aqueous pigment dispersion preferably contains at least four components: (i) a colour pigment, (ii) a polymeric dispersant, (iii) a dispersion synergist and (iv) a dispersion medium.<br>
[0061]   The non-aqueous pigment dispersion may further also contain at least one surfactant.<br>
[0052]   The non-aqueous pigment dispersion is preferably an inkjet ink selected from the group consisting of organic solvent based, oil based and curable pigment inkjet inks. The curable pigment inkjet ink is preferably radiation curable. The viscosity of the pigment inkjet ink is preferably lower than 100 mPa.s at SO^C. The viscosity of the pigment inkjet ink is preferably lower<br><br>
than 30 mPa.s, more preferably lower than 15 mPa.s, and most preferably between 2 and 10 mPa.s at a shear rate of 100 s-' and a jetting temperature between 10 and 70°C.<br>
[0063]   The non-aqueous pigment Inkjet ink may contain at least one humectant to prevent the clogging of the nozzle, due to its ability to slow down the evaporation rate of ink.<br>
[0064]  The curable pigment dispersion may contain as dispersion medium<br>
monomers, oligomers and/or prepolymers possessing different degrees of functionality. A mixture including combinations of mono-, di-, tri- and/or higher functionality monomers, oligomers or prepolymers may be used. A catalyst called an initiator for initiating the polymerization reaction may be included in the curable pigment Inkjet ink. The initiator can be a thermal initiator, but is preferably a photo-initiator. The photo-initiator requires less energy to activate than the monomers, oligomers and/or prepolymers to form the polymer. The photo-initiator suitable for use in the curable pigment dispersion may be a Nornsh type i initiator, a Norrish type 11 initiator or a photo-acid generator.<br>
Pigments<br>
[0065]   The pigment is preferabiy a quinacridone pigment. The quinacridone<br>
pigment may be chosen from those disclosed by HERBST, Willy, et al. Industrial Organic Pigments, Production, Properties, Applications. 3rd edition. Wiley - VCH , 2004. ISBN 3527305769.<br>
[0066]   Suitable pigments include C.I. Pigment Red 122, 192, 202, 207, 209 and 282.<br>
[0057]   Particular preferred quinacridone pigments are C.I. Pigment Violet 19 and C.I. Pigment Red 122.<br>
[0068]   Suitable pigments include mixed crystals of the above particular preferred pigments. A commercially available example is Cinquasia Magenta RT-355-D from Ciba Specialty Chemicals. Preferably the quinacridone pigment is selected from the group consisting of C.I. Pigment Violet 19, C.I. Pigment Red 122, C.I. Pigment Red 202 and mixed crv'stals of quinacridone pigments.<br><br>
[0069]   Mixed crystals are also referred to as solid solutions. Under certain conditions different quinacridones mix with each other to form solid solutions, which are quite different from both physical mixtures of the compounds and from the compounds themselves. In a solid solution, the molecules of the components enter Into the same crystal lattice, usually, but not always, that of one of the components. The x-ray diffraction pattern of the resulting crystalline solid is characteristic of that solid and can be clearly differentiated from the pattern of a physical mixture of the same components in the same proportion. In such physical mixtures, the x-ray pattern of each of the components can be distinguished, and the disappearance of many of these lines is one of the criteria of the formation of solid solutions. Mixed crystals of quinacridone pigments include solid solutions of quinacridone and diketopyrrolo-pyrrole.<br>
[0070]   It was surprisingly found that not only solid solutions of quinacridone and diketopyrrolo-pyrrole could be dispersed by the quinacridone derivative according to the present invention, but also diketopyrrolo-pyrrole pigments and mixed crystals thereof.<br>
[0071]   The diketopyrrolo-pyrrole pigments are preferably selected from the group consisting of C.i. Pigment Orange 71, C.l. Pigment Orange 73, C.I. Pigment Orange 81, C.l. Pigment Red 254, CI. Pigment Red 255, C.l. Pigment Red 2S4, C.l. Pigment Red 270, C.l. Pigment Red 272 and mixed crystals of diketopyrrolo-pyrrole pigments.<br>
[0072]   Pigment particles in Inkjet ink should be sufficiently small to permit free flow of the ink through the inkjet-printing device, especially at the ejecting nozzles. It is also desirable to use small particles for maximum colour strength and to slow down sedimentation.<br>
[0073]   The average particle size of the pigment in an Inkjet ink should be<br>
between 0.005 and 15 pm. The numeric average pigment particle size is preferably between 0.005 and 5 pm, more preferably between 0.005 and 1 pm, particulariy preferably between 0.005 and 0.3 Mm and most preferably between 0.040 and 0.150 pm.<br>
[0074]   The quinacridone pigment is preferably used in a non-aqueous pigment Inkjet ink in an amount of 0.1 to 20 wt%, preferably 1 to 10 vi^% based on<br><br>
the total weight of the non-aqueous inkjet ink. In multi-density inkjet ink-sets, a light inkjet ink preferably comprises the quinacridone pigment in an amount between 0.1 to 3 wt% and a dark inkjet ink preferably comprises the quinacridone pigment in an amount betweeni to 10 wt% of pigment.<br>
[0075]   The non-aqueous inkjet ink comprising a quinacridone pigment and the quinacridone derivative is preferably used in combination with other inkjet inks to form an inkjet ink set. These other inkjet inks may be black, cyan, magenta, yellow, red, orange, violet, blue, green, brown, mixtures thereof, and the like.<br>
[0076]   In a preferred embodiment the inkjet ink set comprises at least a cyan ink, a magenta ink, a yellow ink and a black ink. The CMYK ink set may also be extended with extra inks such as red, green, blue, and/or orange to enlarge the colour gamut of the ink set. The CMYK ink set may also be extended by the combination of full density and light density inks of both color inks and/or black inks to improve the image quality by lowered graininess.<br>
[0077]   The pigment is preferably used in the non-aqueous pigment inkjet ink in an amount of 0.1 to 20 wt%, preferably 1 to 10 wt% based on the total weight of the non-aqueous Inkjet ink. In multi-density inkjet ink sets, a light density inkjet ink preferably comprises the pigment in an amount between 0.1 to 3 wt% and a full density inkjet ink preferably comprises the pigment in an amount betweeni to 10 wt% of pigment.<br>
[0078]   The colour pigment for the other inkjet inks may be chosen from those disclosed by HERBST, Willy, et al. Industrial Organic Pigments, Production, Properties, Applications. 3rd edition. Wiley - VCH , 2004. ISBN 3527305769.<br>
[0079] Particular preferred pigments are C.l. Pigment Yellow 1, 3, 10, 12, 13, 14, 17, 55, 65, 73, 74, 75, 83, 93, 97, 109, 111, 120, 128, 138, 139, 150, 151, 154, 155, 180,185 and 213.<br>
[0080] Particular preferred pigments are C.l. Pigment Yellow 120, 151, 154, 175, 180, 181 and 194.<br>
[0081] Particular preferred pigments are C.l. Pigment Blue 15:1, 15:2, 15:3, 15:4, 15:6, 16, 56, 61 and (bridged) aluminium phthalocyanine pigments.<br><br>

[0083]   Particular preferred pigments are C.I. Pigment Green 7 and 35.<br>
[0084]   Particular preferred pigments are C.I. Pigment Brown 6 and 7.<br>
[0085]   Carbon black is preferred as a pigment for the non-aqueous black Inkjet ink. Suitable black pigment materials include carbon blacks such as Pigment Black 7 (e.g. Carbon Black MAS™ from MITSUBISHI CHEMICAL), RegaFM 400R, Mogul™ L, Elftex™ 320 from CABOT Co., or Carbon Black FW18, Special Black 250, Special Black 350, Special Black 550, Printex™ 25, Printex™ 35, Printex™ 55, Printex™ 90, Printex™ 150T from DEGUSSA. Additional examples of suitable pigments are disclosed in US 5389133 (XEROX) .<br>
[0086]   It is also possible to make mixtures of pigments in a non-aqueous inkjet ink. For example, carbon black generally exhibits a warm brownish black tone, while a neutral black tone is generally preferred. A neutral black inkjet ink can be obtained, for example, by mixing carbon black with a cyan, a magenta or a cyan and magenta pigment into the ink, as for example described in pending European patent application EP 1593718 A (AGFA) . The inkjet application may also require one or more spot colours, for example for packaging inkjet printing or textile inkjet printing. Silver and gold are often desired colours for inkjet poster printing and point-of-sales displays. Particular preferred pigments are C.I. Pigment Metal 1, 2 and 3. Illustrative examples of the inorganic pigments include titanium oxide, barium sulfate, calcium carbonate, zinc oxide, lead sulfate, yellow lead, zinc yellow, red iron oxide (IK), cadmium red, ultramiarine blue, prussian blue, chromium oxide green, cobalt green, amber, titanium black and synthetic iron black.<br>
Dispersants<br>
[0087]   The dispersant used in the non-aqueous pigment dispersion is preferably a polymeric dispersant.<br>
[0088]   Typical polymeric dispersants are copolymers of two monomers but may contain three, four, five or even more monomers. The properties of polymeric dispersants depend on both the nature of the monomers and<br><br>
their distribution in the polymer. Suitable copolymeric dispersants have the following polymer compositions:<br>
statistically polymerized monomers (e.g. monomers A and B<br>
polymerized into ABBAABAB);<br>
alternating polymerized monomers (e.g. monomers A and B<br>
polymerized into ABABABAB);<br>
gradient (tapered) polymerized monomers (e.g. monomers A and B<br>
polymerized into AAABAABBABBB);<br>
block copolymers (e.g. monomers A and B polymerized into<br>
AAAAABBBBBB) wherein the block length of each of the blocks (2, 3,<br>
4, 5 or even more) is important for the dispersion capability of the<br>
polymeric dispersant; * ■   graft copolymers (graft copolymers consist of a polymeric backbone<br>
with side chains attached to the backbone); and<br>
mixed forms of these polymers, e.g. blocky gradient copolymers. [0089]   Polymeric dispersants may have different polymer architecture including linear, comb/branched, star, dendritic (including dendrimers and hyperbranched polymers). A general review on the architecture of polymers is given by ODIAN, George, Principles Of Polymerization, 4th edition, Wiley-lnterscience, 2004, p. 1-18. [0090]   Comb/branched polymers have side branches of linked monomer<br>
molecules protruding from various central branch points along the main polymer chain (at least 3 branch points). [0091]   Star polymers are branched polymers in which three or more either similar or different linear homopolymers or copolymers are linked together to a single core. [0092]   Dendritic polymers comprise the classes of dendrimers and<br>
hyperbranched polymers. In dendrimers, with well-defined mono-disperse structures, all branch points are used (multi-step synthesis), while hyperbranched polymers have a plurality of branch points and multifunctional branches that lead to further branching with polymer growth (one-step polymerization process).<br><br>
[0093]   Suitable polymeric dispersants may be prepared via addition or<br>
condensation type polymerizations. Polymerization methods include those described by ODIAN, George, Principles Of Polymerization, 4th edition, Wiley-lnterscience, 2004, p. 39-606. [0094]   Addition polymerization methods include free radical polymerization (FRP) and controlled polymerization techniques. Suitable controlled radical polymerization methods include:<br>
RAFT; reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer; ATRP: atom transfer radical polymerization<br>
MADIX: reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer process, using a transfer active xanthate;<br>
Catalytic chain transfer (e.g. using cobalt complexes); Nitroxide (e.g. TEMPO) mediated polymerizations; [0095]   Other suitable controlled polymerization methods include: GTP: group transfer polymerization; Living cationic (ring-opening) polymerizations; Anionic co-ordination insertion ring-opening polymerization; and Living anionic (ring-opening) polymerization. [0096]   Reversible addition-fragmentation transfer (RAFT): controlled<br>
polymerization occurs via rapid chain transfer between growing polymer radicals and dormant polymer chains. A review article on RAFT synthesis of dispersants with different polymeric geometry is given in QUINN J.F. et al., Facile Synthesis of comb, star, and graft polymers via reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization, Journal of Polymer Science, Part A: Polymer Chemistry, Vol.40, 2956-2966, 2002.

Living anionic ring-opening polymerization is e.g. used for the ""    synthesis- of poiyethylene oxide macromonomers.-<br>
[0100]   Free radical Polymerization (FRP) proceeds via a chain mechanism, which basically consists of four different types of reactions involving free radicals; (1) radical generation from non-radical species (initiation), (2) radical addition to a substituted aikene (propagation), (3) atom transfer and atom abstraction reactions (chain transfer and termination by disproportionation), and (4) radical-radical recombination reactions (termination by combination).<br>

[0165]   If the non-aqueous pigment dispersion is a curable pigment dispersion, the dispersion medium comprises one or more monomers and/or oligomers to obtain a liquid dispersion medium. Sometimes, it can be advantageous to add a small amount of an organic solvent to improve the dissolution of the dispersant. The content of organic solvent should be lower than 20 wt%<br><br>
based on the total weight of the Inkjet ink. In other cases, it can be advantageous to add a small amount of water, for example, to improve the spreading of the Inkjet ink on a hydrophijic surface, but preferably the Inkjet ink contains no water.<br>
[0166]   Preferred organic solvents include alcohols, aromatic hydrocarbons, ketones, esters, aliphatic hydrocarbons, higher fatty acids, carbitols, cellosolves, higher fatty acid esters. Suitable alcohols include methanol, ethanol, propanol and 1-butanol, 1-pentanol, 2-butano!, t.-butanol. Suitable aromatic hydrocarbons include toluene, and xylene. Suitable ketones include methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, 2,4-pentanedione and hexafluoroacetone. Also glycol, glycolethers, N-methylpyrrolidone, N,N-dimethylacetamid, N, N-dimethylformamid may be used.<br>
[0167]   In the case of a curable inkjet ink, the dispersion medium preferably consists of monomers and/or oligomers.<br>
Monomers and oligomers<br>
[0168]   Any monomer or oligomer may be used as curable compound for the curable inkjet ink. A combination of monomers, oligomers and/or prepolymers may also be used. The monomers, oligomers and/or prepolymers may possess different degrees of functionality, and a mixture including combinations of mono-, di-, tri-and higher functionality monomers, oligomers and/or prepolymers may be used. The viscosity of the inkjet ink can be adjusted by varying the ratio between the monomers and oligomers.<br>
[0169]   Any method of conventional radical polymerization, photo-cuhng system using photo acid or photo base generator, or photo induction alternating copolymerization may be employed. In general, radical polymerization and cationic polymerization are preferred, and photo induction alternating copolymerization needing no initiator may also be employed. Furthermore, a hybrid system of combinations of these systems is also effective.<br>
[0170]   Cationic polymerization is superior in effectiveness due to lack of inhibition of the polymerization by oxygen, however it is expensive and slow, especially under conditions of high relative humidity. If cationic polymerization is used, it is preferred to use an epoxy compound together<br><br>
with an oxetane compound to increase the rate of polymerization. Radical polymerization is the preferred polymerization process. [0171]  Any polymerizable compound commonly known in the art may be<br>
employed. Particularly preferred for use as a radiation curable compound in the radiation curable Inkjet ink are monofunctiona! and/or polyfunctional acrylate monomers, oligomers or prepolymers, such as isoamyl acryiate, stearyl acrylate, lauryl acrylate, octyl acrylate, decyl acrylate, isoamylstyl acrylate, isostearyl acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl-diglycol acrylate, 2-hydroxybutyl acrylate, 2-acryloyloxyethylhexahydrophthalic acid, butoxyethyl acrylate, ethoxydiethylene glycol acrylate, methoxydiethylene glycol acryiate, methoxypolyethylene glycol acrylate, methoxypropylene glycol acrylate, phenoxyethyl acrylate, tetrahydrofurfuryl acrylate, isobornyl acrylate, 2-'   hydroxyethyracrylate, 2-hydroxyprbpyl acryiate, 2-hydroxy-3-phenoxypropyl acrylate, vinyl ether acrylate, vinyl ether ethoxy (meth)acryiate, 2-acryioyloxyethylsuccinic acid, 2-acryloyxyethylphthalic acid, 2-acryloxyethyl-2-hydroxyethyl-phthalic acid, lactone modified flexible acrylate, and t-butylcydohexyl acrylate, triethylene glycol diacrylate, tetraethylene glycol diacrylate, polyethylene glycol diacrylate, dipropylene glycol diacrylate, tripropylene glycol diacrylate, polypropylene glycol diacrylate, 1,4-butanediol diacrylate, 1,6-hexanediol diacrylate, 1,9-nonanediol diacrylate, neopentyl glycol diacrylate, dimethylol-tricyciodecane diacrylate, bisphenol A EO (ethylene oxide) adduct diacrylate, bisphenol A PO (propylene oxide) adduct diacrylate, hydroxypivalate neopentyl glycol diacrylate, propoxylated neopentyl glycol diacrylate, alkoxylated dimethyloltricyclodecane diacrylate and pofytetramethylene glycol diacrylate, trimethylolpropane triacrylate, EO modified trimethylolpropane triacrylate, tri (propylene glycol) triacrylate, caprolactone modified trimethylolpropane triacrylate, pentaerythritol triacrylate, pentaerithritol tetraacrylate, pentaerythritoiethoxy tetraa cry late, dipentaerythritol hexaacrylate, ditrimethylolpropane tetraacrylate, giycerinpropoxy triacrylate, and caprolactam modified dipentaerythritol hexaacrylate, or an N-vinylamide such as, N-vinylcaprolactam or N-<br><br>

Initiators<br>
[0193]  The curable inkjet ink preferably also contains an initiator. The initiator<br>
typically initiates the polymerization reaction. The initiator can be a thermal initiator, but is preferably a photo-initiator. The photo-initiator requires less energy to activate than the monomers, oligomers and/or prepolymers to form the polymer. The photo-initiator suitable for use in the curable inkjet ■■' inks maybe a Norrish type I inrtiator, a Norrish type I! initiator or a photo- -acid generator.<br>
[0194]   Thermal initiator(s) suitable for use in the curable inkjet ink include tert-amyl peroxybenzoate, 4,4-azobis(4-cyanovaleric acid), 1,1'-azobis(cydohexanecarbonitrile), 2,2'-azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN), benzoyl peroxide, 2,2-bis( tert-butylperoxy)butane, 1,1-bis( tert-butylperoxy)cyclohexane,1,1-bis( tert-butylperoxy)cyclohexane, 2,5-bis( tert-butylperoxy)-2,5-dimethylhexane, 2,5-bis( tert-butylperoxy)-2,5-dimethy!-3-hexyne, bls(1-( tert-butylperoxy)-1-methylethyI)benzene, 1,1-bis( tert-butylperoxy)-3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane, tert-butyl hydroperoxide, tert-butyl peracetate, tert-butyl peroxide, tert-butyl peroxybenzoate, tert-butylperoxy isopropyl carbonate, cumene hydroperoxide, cyclohexanone peroxide, dicumyl peroxide, iauroyi peroxide, 2,4- pentanedione peroxide, peracetic acid and potassium persulfate.<br>
[0195]  The photo-initiator or photo-initiator system absorbs light and is<br>
responsible for the production of initiating species, such as free radicals and cations. Free radicals and cations are high-energy species that induce polymerization of monomers, oligomers and polymers and with polyfunctional monomers and oligomers thereby also inducing cross-linking.<br><br>
[0196]   Irradiation with actinic radiation may be realized in two steps by changing wavelength or intensity. In such cases it is preferred to use 2 types of photo-initiator together.<br>

[0203]   Suitable cationic photo-initiators include compounds, which form aprotic acids or Bronstead acids upon exposure to ultraviolet and/or visible light sufftcient to initiate polymerization. The photo-initiator used may be a single compound, a mixture of two or more active compounds, or a combination of two or more different compounds, i.e. co-initiators. Non-limiting examples of suitable cationic photo-initiators are aryldiazonium salts, diaryliodonium salts, triarylsulphonium salts, triarylselenonium salts and the like.<br>
[0204]  The curable Inkjet ink may contain a photo-initiator system containing one or more photo-initiators and one or more sensitizers that transfer energy to the photo-inittator(s).

The amount of the sensitizer is in general from 0.01 to 15 wt%, preferably from 0.05 to 5 w\.%, based in each case on the total weight of the curable Inkjet ink.<br>
[0205]   In order to increase the photosensitivity further, the curable Inkjet ink may additionally contain co-initiators. For example, the combination of titanocenes and trichloromethyl-s-triazines, of titanocenes and ketoxime ethers and of achdines and trichloromethyl-s-triazines is known. A further increase in sensitivity can be achieved by adding dibenzalacetone or amino acid derivatives. The amount of co-initiator or co-initiators is in general from 0.01 to 20 wt%, preferably from 0.05 to 10 wt%, based in each case on the total weight of the curable Inkjet ink.<br>
[0206]  A preferred initiator system is 2,2'-bis(o-chlorophenyl)-4,4',5,5'-tetraphenyl-(7CI,8C1) 4,4'-Bi-41-i-imidazole corresponding to the chemical formula:<br><br><br>
[0208]   A preferred amount of initiator is 0.3 - 50 wt% of tlie total weigiit of the curable liquid, and more preferably 1-15 wt% of the total weight of the curable Inkjet ink.<br>
[0209]   Irradiation with actinic radiation may be realized in two steps by changing wavelength or intensity. In such cases it is preferred to use 2 types of photo-initiator together.<br>
Inhibitors<br>
[0210]   The radiation curable Inkjet ink may contain a polymerization inhibitor. Suitable polymerization inhibitors include phenol type antioxidants, hindered amine light stabilizers, phosphor type antioxidants, hydroquinone monomethyl ether commonly used in (meth)acrylate monomers, and hydroquinone, t-butylcatechoi, pyrogallol may also be used.<br>

[0212]   Since excessive addition of these polymerization inhibitors will lower the ink sensitivity to curing, it is preferred that the amount capable of preventing polymerization is determined prior to blending. The amount of a polymerization inhibitor is preferably lower than 2 wt% of the total ink.<br>
Binders<br>
[0213]   Non-aqueous inkjet ink compositions preferably comprise a binder resin. The binder functions as a viscosity controlling agent and also provides fixability relative to the polymeric resin substrate, e.g. a polyvinyl chloride substrate, also called vinyl substrate. The binder must be selected to have a good solubility in the solvent(s).<br>
[0214]   Suitable examples of binder resins include acrylic resins, modified acrylic resins, styrene acrylic resins, acrylic copolymers, acrylate resins, aldehyde resins, rosins, rosin esters, modified rosins and modified rosin resins, acetyl polymers, acetal resins such as polyvinyl butyral, ketone resins, phenolic resins and modified phenolic resins, maleic resins and modified maleic resins, terpene resins, polyester resins, poiyamide resins, polyurethane resins, epoxy resins, vinyl resins, vinyl chloride-vinyl acetate copolymer resins, cellulose type resins such as nitro cellulose, cellulose acetopropionate and cellulose acetate butyrate, and vinyl toiuene-a-methylstyiene copolymer resin.

anionic, cationic, non-ionic, or zwitter-ionic and are usually added in a total<br>
quantity less than 20 wt% based on the total weight of the Inkjet ink and<br>
partlculariy in a total less than 10 wt% based on the total weight of the<br>
Inkjet ink.	'<br>
[0219]   Suitable surfactants include fluorinated surfactants, fatty acid salts, ester salts of a higher alcohol, alkylbenzene sulphonate salts, sulphosucclnate ester salts and phosphate ester salts of a higher alcohol (for example, sodium dodecyibenzenesulphonate and sodium dioctylsulphosuccinate), ethylene oxide adducts of a higher alcohol, ethylene oxide adducts of an alkylphenol, ethylene oxide adducts of a polyhydric alcohol fatty acid ester, and acetylene glycol and ethylene oxide adducts thereof (for example, polyoxyethylene nonylpheny! ether, and SURFYNOL™ 104, 104H, 440, 465 and TG available from AIR PRODUCTS &amp; CHEMICALS INC.).<br>
[0220]   For non-aqueous Inkjet inks preferred surfactants are selected from fluoro surfactants (such as fluorinated hydrocarbons) and silicone surfactants. The silicones are typically siloxanes and can be alkoxylated, potyether modified, polyether modified hydroxy functional, amine modified, epoxy modified and other modifications or combinations thereof. Preferred siloxanes are polymeric, for example poiydimethyislloxanes.<br>
[0221]   In a curable Inkjet ink a fluorinated or silicone compound may be used as a surfactant, preferably a cross-linkable surfactant is used. Polymerizable monomers having surface-active effects include silicone modified acrylates, silicone modified methacrylates, acrylated siloxanes, polyether modified acrylic modified siloxanes, fluorinated acrylates, and fluorinated<br><br>
methacrylates. Polymerizable monomers having surface-active effects can be mono-, di-, tri- or higher functional (meth)acrylates or mixtures thereof.<br>

The humectant is preferably added to the Inkjet ink formulation in an amount of 0.1 to 40 wt% of the formulation, more preferably 0.1 to 10 wt% of the formulation, and most preferably approximately 4.0 to 6.0 wt%.<br>
Preparation of a pigment Inkjet inks<br>
[0223]   The Inkjet ink may be prepared by precipitating or milling the pigment in the dispersion medium in the presence of the dispersant.<br>
[0224]   Mixing apparatuses may include a pressure kneader, an open kneader, a planetary mixer, a dissolver, and a Dalton Universal Mixer. Suitable milling and dispersion apparatuses are a ball mill, a pearl mill, a colloid mill, a high-speed disperser, double rollers, a bead mill, a paint conditioner, and triple rollers. The dispersions may also be prepared using ultrasonic energy.<br>
[0225]   Many different types of materials may be used as milling media, such as glasses, ceramics, metals, and plastics. In a preferred embodiment, the grinding media can comprise particles, preferably substantially spherical in shape, e.g. beads consisting essentially of a polymehc resin or yttrium stabilized zirconium oxide beads.<br>
[0225]   In the process of mixing, milling and dispersion, each process is performed with cooling to prevent build up of heat, and for radiation curable Inkjet inks as much as possible under light conditions in which actinic radiation has been substantially excluded.<br><br>
[0227]   The Inkjet ink according to the present invention may contain more than<br>
one pigment, the Inkjet ink may be prepared using separate dispersions for each pigment, or alternatively several pigments may be mixed and co-milled in preparing the dispersion.<br>
[0228]   The dispersion process can be carried out in a continuous, batch or semi-batch mode.<br>
[0229]   The preferred amounts and ratios of the ingredients of the mill grind will vary widely depending upon the specific materials and the intended applications. The contents of the milling mixture comprise the mill ghnd and the milling media. The mill grind comprises pigment, polymeric dispersant and a liquid carrier. For Inkjet inks, the pigment is usually present in the mill grind at 1 to 50 wt%, excluding the milling media. The weight ratio of pigment over polymeric dispersant is 20:1 to 1:2.<br>
[0230]   The milling time can vary widely and depends upon the pigment,<br>
mechanical means and residence conditions selected, the initial and desired final particle size, etc. In the present invention pigment dispersions with an average particle size of less than 100 nm may be prepared.<br>
[0231]   After milling is completed, the milling media is separated from the milled particulate product (in either a dn&gt;/ or liquid dispersion form) using conventional separation techniques, such as by filtration, sieving through a mesh screen, and the like. Often the sieve is built into the mill, e.g. for a bead mill. The milled pigment concentrate is preferably separated from the milling media by filtration.<br>
[0232]   In general it is desirable to make the Inkjet inks in the form of a<br>
concentrated mill grind, which is subsequently diluted to the appropriate concentration for use in the Inkjet printing system. This technique permits preparation of a greater quantity of pigment ink from the equipment. By dilution, the Inkjet ink is adjusted to the desired viscosity, surface tension, colour, hue, saturation density, and print area coverage for the particular application.<br>
Spectral Separation Factor<br>
[0233]   The spectral separation factor SSF was found to be an excellent measure to characterize a pigment Inkjet ink, as it takes into account properties<br><br>
related to light-absorption (e.g. wavelength of maximum absorbance Amax, shape of the absorption spectrum and absorbance-value at Amax) as well as properties related to the dispersion quality and stability.<br>
[0234]   A measurement of the absorbance at a higher wavelength gives an<br>
indication on the shape of the absorption spectrum. The dispersion quality can be evaluated based on the phenomenon of light scattering induced by solid particles in solutions. When measured in transmission, light scattering in pigment inks may be detected as an increased absorbance at higher wavelengths than the absorbance peak of the actual pigment. The dispersion stability can be evaluated by comparing the SSF before and after a heat treatment of e.g. a week at 80°C.<br>
[0235]   The spectral separation factor SSF of the ink is calculated by using the data of the recorded spectrum of an ink solution or a jetted image on a substrate and comparing the maximum absorbance to the absorbance at a higher reference wavelength Aref The spectral separation factor is calculated as the ratio of the maximum absorbance Amax over the absorbance Aref at a reference wavelength.<br>

[0236]   The SSF is an excellent tool to design Inkjet ink sets with large colour<br>
gamut. Often Inkjet ink sets are now commercialized, wherein the different inks are not sufficiently matched with each other. For example, the combined absorption of all inks does not give a complete absorption over the whole visible spectrum, e.g. "gaps" exist between the absorption spectra of the colorants. Another problem is that one ink might be absorbing in the range of another ink. The resulting colour gamut of these Inkjet ink sets is low or mediocre.<br>

Measurement methods<br>
1. Measurement of SSF<br>
[0239]   The spectral separation factor SSF of the ink was calculated by using the data of the recorded spectrum of an ink solution and comparing the maximum absorbance to the absorbance at a reference wavelength. The reference wavelength chosen for a magenta Inkjet ink was 650 nm.<br>
[0240]   The absorbance was determined in transmission with a Shimadzu<br>
UV-2101 PC double beam-spsctrophotometer. The ink was diluted with ethyl acetate to have a pigment concentration of 0.005%. A spectrophotometric measurement of the UV-VIS-NIR absorption spectrum<br><br>
of the diluted ink was performed in transmission-mode with a double beam-spectrophotometer using the settings of Table 3. Quartz cells with a path length of 10 mm were used and ethyl acetate was chosen as a blank.<br><br>
[0241]   Efficient pigment Inkjet inks exhibiting a narrow absorption spectrum and a high maximum absorbance have a value for SSF of at least 30.<br>
2.	Dispersion stability<br>
[0242]   The dispersion stability was evaluated by comparing the SSF before and after a heat treatment of one week at 80°C. Pigmented Inkjet inks exhibiting good dispersion stability have a SSF after heat treatment still larger than 30 and a loss in SSF of less than 35%.<br>
3.	Average particle size<br>
[0243] The average particle size of pigment particles in Inkjet ink Vi/as determined with a Brookhaven Instruments Particle Sizar BI90plus based upon the principle of dynamic light scattering. The ink or dispersion was diluted with ethyl acetate to a pigment concentration of 0.002 wt%. The measurement settings of the B!90plus were: 5 runs at 23°C, angle of 90°, wavelength of 635 nm and graphics = correction function.<br>
[0244]   For good ink jet characteristics Getting characteristics and print quality) the average particle size of the dispersed particles is below 200 nm, preferably about 100 nm. The Inkjet ink is considered to be a stable pigment dispersion if the particle size remains below 200 nm after heat treatment of 7 days at 80°C.<br>
4.	Viscosity<br>
[0245]   The viscosity of the Inkjet inks was measured using a Brookfieid DV-I1+<br>
viscometer at 25°C and shear rate of 15 RPM. EXAMPLE 1<br><br>
