				<td>OPHTHALMIC DEVICES COMPRISING PHOTOCHROMIC MATERIALS<br>
WITH REACTIVE SUBSTITUENTS<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[001] Various non-limiting embodiments of the present disclosure relate to<br>
ophthalmic devices comprising photochromic materials comprising a reactive<br>
substituent. Other non-limiting embodiments of the present disclosure relate to<br>
photochromic ophthalmic devices, and methods of making the photochromic<br>
ophthalmic devices, wherein the photochromic ophthalmic devices comprise the<br>
photochromic materials described herein.<br>
[002] Many conventional photochromic materials, such as, for example,<br>
photochromic naphthopyrans, can undergo a transformation from one state to<br>
another in response to the absorption of electromagnetic radiation. For example,<br>
many conventional photochromic materials are capable of transforming between a<br>
first "clear" or "bleached" ground state and a second "colored" activated state in<br>
response to the absorption of certain wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation (or<br>
"actinic radiation"). As used herein the term "actinic radiation" refers to<br>
electromagnetic radiation that is capable of causing a photochromic material to<br>
transform from one form or state to another. The photochromic material may then<br>
revert back to the clear ground state in response to thermal energy in the absence of<br>
actinic radiation. Photochromic articles and compositions that contain one or more<br>
photochromic materials, for example photochromic lenses for eyewear applications,<br>
generally display clear and colored states that correspond to the photochromic<br>
material(s) that they contain. Thus, for example, eyewear lenses that contain<br>
photochromic materials can transform from a clear state to a colored state upon<br>
exposure to actinic radiation, such as certain wavelengths found in sunlight, and can<br>
revert back to the clear state in the absence of such radiation.<br>
[003] When utilized in photochromic articles and compositions, conventional<br>
photochromic materials are typically incorporated into a host polymer matrix by one<br>
of imbibing, blending and/or bonding. For example, one or more photochromic<br>
materials may be intermixed with a polymeric material or precursor thereof, and<br>
VTN5080<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
thereafter the photochromic composition may be formed into the photochromic<br>
article or, alternatively, the photochromic composition may be coated on a surface of<br>
an optical element as a thin film or layer. As used herein, the term "photochromic<br>
composition" refers to a photochromic material in combination with one or more<br>
other material, which may or may not be a photochromic material. Alternatively,<br>
the photochromic material may be imbibed into a pre-formed article or coating.<br>
[004] In certain circumstances it may be desirable to modify the compatibility of<br>
the photochromic material with the host polymer into which it is incorporated. For<br>
example, by making the photochromic material more compatible with the host<br>
polymer, it is less likely that the combination will demonstrate cloudiness or haze<br>
due to phase separation or migration of the photochromic material in the host<br>
polymer. In addition, compatibilized photochromic materials may be more soluble<br>
in the host polymer and/or more uniformly distributed throughout the polymer<br>
matrix. Further, by modifying the compatibility of a photochromic material with a<br>
host polymer, other properties of the photochromic composition, such as, but not<br>
limited to, fade and/or activation rate, saturated optical density, molar absorptivity or<br>
molar extinction coefficient, and activated color, may also be effected.<br>
Modifications to such properties may be done, for example, to match the same<br>
properties of complementary photochromic materials or to enable the use of such<br>
compounds in hydrophilic or hydrophobic coating compositions, thin films or in<br>
rigid to flexible plastic matrices.<br>
[005] One approach to modifying the compatibility of a photochromic material<br>
with a host polymer is to attach a polymerizable moiety to the photochromic<br>
material via a polyalkoxylated linking group, for example, a polyethylene glycol, a<br>
polypropylene glycol, and/or a polybutylene glycol linking group. One potential<br>
limitation of utilizing polyalkoxylated linking groups is the degree of purity of the<br>
resultant photochromic material that can be readily achieved. For example,<br>
commercially available polyglycols that may be incorporated into the linking groups<br>
of these photochromic materials may comprise mixtures of glycol chains possessing<br>
VTN5080<br><br>
-3-<br>
differing numbers of glycol units within each chain. Incorporation of these<br>
commercially available polyglycols into the photochromic material may lead to<br>
mixtures of compounds differing in chain lengths and molecular weights. This may<br>
lead to difficulty in purification, since one cannot readily separate out the desired<br>
photochromic materials in these mixtures.<br>
[006] Further, polyalkoxylated linking groups may comprise long chains<br>
containing multiple ether oxygen functionalities, which are inherently hydrophilic.<br>
While this may present certain desirable traits with regard to compatibility with the<br>
host polymer, linking groups with differing hydrophilicities, including linking<br>
groups that may be hydrophobic or, alternatively, linking groups of shorter length,<br>
may provide for different interactions with the host polymer and the resultant<br>
photochromic article.<br>
[007] Accordingly, for some applications it may be desirable to develop<br>
photochromic materials that may be incorporated into a variety of host polymers and<br>
which may comprise one or more reactive substituents having polarities (i.e.<br>
hydrophilicities or lipophilicities) that may more closely match the polarities of the<br>
host polymer. In other applications, it may be desirable to develop photochromic<br>
materials comprising one or more reactive substituent having polarities that do not<br>
match the polarities of the host polymers. In addition, it may be advantageous to<br>
develop photochromic materials comprising reactive substituents of uniform<br>
composition/molecular weight that can be readily purified, such as, by<br>
crystallization, chromatography, or other methods of purification known to one<br>
skilled in the art.<br>

-21 -<br>
[030] According to various non-limiting embodiments disclosed herein, the groups<br>
B and B' (shown above) are part of the photochromic naphthopyran core<br>
substructure. Without intending to be limited by any particular theory, it is believed<br>
that the B and B' groups may help stabilize the open form of the core naphthopyran<br>
substructure by being in conjugation with the pi-system of the open form of the core<br>
naphthopyran substructure. Suitable structures for B and/or B' are any structures<br>
that have at least one pi-bond that is in conjugation with the pi-system of the open<br>
form of the core naphthopyran substructure, for example, but not limited to, a<br>
substituted or unsubstituted aryl ring (e.g., a substituted or unsubstituted phenyl ring<br>
or naphthyl ring), and substituted or unsubstituted heteroaromatic ring structures.<br>
Various non-limiting examples for structure B and/or B' are discussed in detail<br>
hereinbelow.<br>
[031] Photochromic naphthopyrans that are suitable for use in conjunction with<br>
various non-limiting embodiments disclosed herein, include, but are not limited to,<br>

naphthopyrans having these structures are shown below in structures 1 through 4,<br>
respectively.<br>
VTN5080<br><br>
-22-<br><br>
[032] As discussed above, the photochromic materials according to various non-<br>
limiting embodiments disclosed herein, such as photochromic naphthopyrans,<br>
comprise a reactive substituent. As used herein, the term "reactive substituent"<br>
means an arrangement of atoms, wherein a portion of the arrangement comprises a<br>
reactive moiety or residue thereof. According to various non-limiting embodiments<br>
disclosed herein, the reactive substituent further comprises a linking group<br>
connecting the reactive moiety to the photochromic naphthopyran. As used herein,<br>
the term "moiety" means a part or portion of an organic molecule that has a<br>
characteristic chemical property. As used herein, the term "reactive moiety" means<br>
a part or portion of an organic molecule that may react to form one or more covalent<br>
bonds with an intermediate in a polymerization reaction, or with a polymer into<br>
which it has been incorporated. As used herein, the phrase "intermediate in the<br>
polymerization reaction" means any combination of two or more host monomer<br>
VTN5080<br><br>
-23-<br>
units that are capable of reacting to form one or more bonds to additional host<br>
monomer unit(s) to continue a polymerization reaction or, alternatively, reacting<br>
with a reactive moiety of the reactive substituent on the photochromic material. For<br>
example, in one non-limiting embodiment the reactive moiety may react as a co-<br>
monomer in the polymerization reaction. Alternatively, but not limiting herein, the<br>
reactive moiety may react with the intermediate as a nucleophile or electrophile. As<br>
used herein, the term "host monomer or oligomer" means the monomeric or<br>
oligomeric material(s) into which the photochromic materials of the present<br>
disclosure may be incorporated. As used herein, the terms "oligomer" or<br>
"oligomeric material" refer to a combination of two or more monomer units that are<br>
capable of reacting with an additional monomer unit(s). As used herein, the term<br>
"linking group" means one or more group(s) or chain(s) of atoms that connect the<br>
reactive moiety to the photochromic naphthopyran. As used herein, the term<br>
"residue of a reactive moiety" means that which remains after a reactive moiety has<br>
been reacted with either a protecting group or an intermediate in a polymerization<br>
reaction. As used herein, the term "protecting group" means a group of atoms<br>
removably bonded to the reactive moiety that prevents the reactive moiety from<br>
participating in a reaction until the group is removed.<br>
[033] In one non-limiting embodiment, the reactive moiety comprises a<br>
polymerizable moiety. As used herein, the term "polymerizable moiety" means a<br>
part or portion of an organic molecule that can participate as a co-monomer in a<br>
polymerization reaction of a host monomer or oligomer. In another non-limiting<br>
embodiment, the reactive moiety comprises a nucleophilic moiety that reacts to form<br>
a bond with an electrophilic moiety on either the intermediate in the polymerization<br>
reaction or the host polymer. Alternatively, in another non-limiting embodiment,<br>
the reactive moiety comprises an electrophilic moiety that reacts to form a bond with<br>
a nucleophilic moiety on either the intermediate in the polymerization reaction or the<br>
host polymer. As used herein, the term "nucleophilic moiety" means an atom or<br>
grouping of atoms that is electron rich. As used herein, the term "electrophilic<br>
VTN5080<br><br>
-24-<br>
moiety" means an atom or grouping of atoms that is electron poor. It is appreciated<br>
by one skilled in the art that nucleophilic moieties can react with electrophilic<br>
moieties, for example to form a covalent bond therebetween.<br>
[034] As discussed above, in one non-limiting embodiment, the ophthalmic<br>
devices of the present invention compromise a photochromic naphthopyran and a<br>
reactive substituent bonded to the photochromic naphthopyran. The reactive<br>
substituent may be bonded to the photochromic naphthopyran at a variety of<br>
positions on the photochromic naphthopyran. Referring to the numbering scheme<br>
associated with structures 1, 2, 3, and 4 above, according to certain non-limiting<br>
embodiments, a reactive substituent(s) may be attached to the naphthopyran as<br>
follows. For structures 1 or 2, a reactive substituent may be bonded to the<br>
naphthopyran at any of the positions numbered 5 through 10. For structures 3 or 4, a<br>
reactive substituent may be bonded to the indeno-fused naphthopyran at any of the<br>
positions numbered 5 through 13. In addition, for structures 1, 2, 3, and 4, a reactive<br>
substituent may additionally or alternatively be bonded to group B and/or group B'.<br>
[035] For example, according to various non-limiting embodiments disclosed<br>
herein wherein the photochromic naphthopyran comprises a 2H-naphtho[l,2-<br>
b]pyran or a 3H-naphtho[2,l-b]pyran, structures 1 or 2 respectively, a reactive<br>
substituent may be bonded to the photochromic naphthopyran by replacing a<br>
hydrogen on the rings of the naphtho-portion of the photochromic naphthopyran<br>
with a reactive substituent. Alternatively or in addition, a reactive substituent may<br>
be bonded to photochromic naphthopyran 1 or 2 by replacing a hydrogen on the B<br>
and/or B' groups of the photochromic naphthopyran with a reactive substituent.<br>
According to other non-limiting embodiments, wherein the photochromic<br>
naphthopyran comprises an indeno[2',3':3,4] naphtho[l,2-b]pyran or an<br>
indeno[l',2':4,3 ]naphtho [2,l-b]pyran, structures 3 or 4 respectively, a reactive<br>
substituent may be bonded to the photochromic naphthopyran by replacing a<br>
hydrogen on the rings of the indeno-fused naphtho-portion of the photochromic<br>
naphthopyran with a reactive substituent. Alternatively or in addition, a reactive<br>
VTN5080<br><br>
-25-<br>
substituent may be bonded to photochromic naphthopyran 3 or 4 by replacing a<br>
hydrogen on the B and/or B' groups of the photochromic naphthopyran with a<br>
reactive substituent.<br>
[036] As discussed above, according to various non-limiting embodiments<br>
disclosed herein, the reactive substituent may be represented by one of the following<br>
groupings of structures:<br>
-A-D-E-G-J;<br>
-G-E-G-J;<br>
-D-E-G-J;<br>
-A-D-J;<br>
-D-G-J; and<br>
-D-J;<br>
wherein the groups -A-, -D-, -E-, and -G- are as set forth above, and -J is a group<br>
comprising a reactive moiety or residue of a reactive moiety; or -J is hydrogen,<br>
provided that if -J is hydrogen, -J is bonded to an oxygen of group -D- or -G-,<br>
forming a reactive moiety. The -J group may comprise any moiety capable of<br>
reacting with an intermediate in the polymerization reaction or the host monomer.<br>
For example, in one non-limiting embodiment, the -J group comprises a<br>
polymerizable moiety that can react as a co-monomer in an addition-type<br>
polymerization reaction or a condensation-type polymerization reaction of the host<br>
monomer, resulting in a co-polymer of the photochromic material and the host<br>
polymer. As used herein, the term "addition-type polymerization reaction" means a<br>
polymerization reaction in which the resultant polymer contains all of the atoms<br>
originally present in the monomer units. As used herein, the term "condensation-<br>
type polymerization reaction" means a polymerization reaction in which the<br>
resultant polymer does not contain all of the atoms originally present in the<br>
monomer units. As used herein, the term "host polymer" means the polymer that<br>
results from polymerization of the host monomer. For example, in certain non-<br>
limiting embodiments, the host polymer may include polymers that may contain a<br>
VTN5080<br><br>
-26-<br>
functionality that can react to form a bond with a reactive substituent on the<br>
photochromic material. In other non-limiting embodiments, the host polymer may<br>
be the polymer in which the photochromic material is incorporated within or<br>
otherwise co-polymerized with or bonded to. In another non-limiting embodiment,<br>
the -J group comprises a nucleophilic or electrophilic moiety that can react with an<br>
electrophilic or nucleophilic moiety, respectively, on an intermediate in the<br>
polymerization reaction or on the host polymer. In another non-limiting<br>
embodiment, -J comprises a hydrogen, provided that when -J is hydrogen, -J is<br>
bonded to an oxygen of group -D- or -G-, forming a reactive moiety, i.e., a hydroxyl<br>
group.<br>
[037] When -J is bonded to an oxygen or a nitrogen, reactive moieties suitable for<br>
use in various non-limiting embodiments of the present disclosure include, but are<br>
not limited to, acryl, methacryl, crotyl, 2-(methacryloxy)ethylcarbamyl, 2-<br>
(methacryloxy) ethoxycarbonyl, 4-vinylphenyl, vinyl, 1 -chlorovinyl, and epoxy.<br>
Structures corresponding to such reactive moieties are shown below:<br><br>
[038] Alternatively, -J may be hydrogen, provided that if -J is hydrogen, -J is<br>
bonded to an oxygen, such that the linkage is terminated by a reactive hydroxyl<br>
group, wherein the hydroxyl group comprises the reactive moiety.<br>
VTN5080<br><br>
-27-<br>
[039] As indicated above, the reactive substituent according to various non-<br>
limiting embodiments disclosed herein may comprise one or more groups -A-, -D-, -<br>
E-, and -G- which connect the group -J to the photochromic naphthopyran. As used<br>
herein, linking groups, as defined above, may comprise one or more of the groups<br>
-A-, -D-, -E-, and -G-. That is, various combinations of groups -A-, -D-, -E-, and -<br>
G- can form the linking group portion of the reactive substituent. As defined herein,<br>
the term "group" or "groups" means an arrangement of one or more atoms.<br>
[040] The structure of the linking groups of the various non-limiting embodiments<br>
will now be discussed in detail. As discussed above, the linking group portion of the<br>
reactive substituent comprises various combinations of the groups -A-, -D-, -E-, and<br>
-G-. For example, in certain non-limiting embodiments, the linking group portion of<br>
the reactive substituent comprises: -A-D-E-G-, -G-E-G-, -D-E-G-, -A-D-, -D-G-, or<br>
-D-, wherein a first group of the linking group is bonded to the photochromic<br>
naphthopyran at a position as set forth above and a second group of the linking<br>
group is bonded to the -J group as discussed in detail below. It will be understood<br>
by one having skill in the art that linking groups comprising various combinations of<br>
the groups -A-, -D-, -E-, and -G- can be synthesized by a variety of methods and the<br>
bond connections discussed below are for illustration purposes only and are in no<br>
way intended to imply a particular required or preferred synthetic approach to<br>
making the reactive substituent.<br>
[041] The connections between the various groups, i.e., -A-, -D-, -E-, and -G-,<br>
according to various non-limiting embodiments will now be discussed. In one non-<br>
limiting embodiment, the -A- group forms a bond with the photochromic<br>
naphthopyran and a bond with the -D- group. According to this non-limiting<br>
embodiment, the A-D bond may be a covalent bond between the carbonyl or<br>
methylene carbon of the -A- group and a nitrogen or oxygen of the diamine residue<br>
or amino alcohol residue of the -D- group. For example, according to various non-<br>
limiting embodiments, when -A- comprises a carbonyl carbon, the A-D bond may be<br>
an amide or an ester bond. In another non-limiting embodiment, when -A-<br>
VTN5080<br><br>
-28-<br>
comprises a methylene carbon, the A-D bond may be an amine or ether bond. As<br>
used herein, the term "methylene" means an organic group having the structure<br>
-CH2-.<br>
[042] In other non-limiting embodiments, the -D- group forms a bond with an -A-<br>
group (as described above) or the photochromic naphthopyran and a bond with an -<br>
E- or -G- group. According to one non-limiting embodiment, the D-E bond may be<br>
a covalent bond between a nitrogen or oxygen of the diamine residue or amino<br>
alcohol residue of the -D- group and the carbonyl carbon of one of the carboxylic<br>
acid residues of the -E- group, forming an amide or ester bond therebetween.<br>
According to another non-limiting embodiment, the D-G bond may be a covalent<br>
bond wherein the nitrogen or oxygen of the diamine residue or amino alcohol<br>
residue of the -D- group replaces a terminal oxygen residue on the polyol residue or<br>
polyalkyleneglycol residue of the -G- group, thereby forming an amine or ether<br>
bond.<br>
[043] In other non-limiting embodiments, the -E- group forms a bond with a -D-<br>
group (as described above) or a first -G- group and a bond with a second -G- group.<br>
According to these non-limiting embodiments, the E-G bond may be a covalent<br>
bond between a terminal oxygen residue on the polyol residue or polyalkyleneglycol<br>
residue of the -G- group and the carbonyl carbon of one of the carboxylic acid<br>
residues of the -E- group, forming an ester bond therebetween.<br>
[044] As previously discussed, the physical and chemical nature of linking groups<br>
may have an effect on the overall properties of the photochromic material. For<br>
example, in one non-limiting embodiment, the linking groups of the reactive<br>
substituent may have a hydrophilic nature such that the photochromic material may<br>
be more readily soluble in hydrophilic or polar host monomers. In another non-<br>
limiting embodiment, the linking groups of the reactive substituent may have a<br>
lipophilic nature such that the photochromic material may be more readily soluble in<br>
lipophilic or nonpolar host monomers.<br>
VTN5080<br><br>
-29-<br>
[045] The linking groups according to certain non-limiting embodiments of the<br>
present disclosure may also be of a uniform length and/or composition such that the<br>
resultant photochromic material may be more readily purified, when compared to a<br>
photochromic material having linking groups of non-uniform length. For example,<br>
in certain non-limiting embodiments where the linking group is of a uniform length<br>
and/or composition, the resultant photochromic material may be crystalline and<br>
therefore may be purified by recrystallization. In other non-limiting embodiments,<br>
where the linking group is of a uniform length and/or composition, the resultant<br>
photochromic material may be readily purified by chromatographic methods or other<br>
methods of purification known to one skilled in the art. For example, in one non-<br>
limiting embodiment set forth in Example 3, the photochromic material (i.e., 3-<br>
phenyl-3-(4-morpholinophenyl)-6-methoxy-7-(4-(2-<br>
methacryloxyethyl)carbamylpiperizin-1 -yl)-13,13-dimethyl-3H, 13H-<br>
indeno[2',3':3,4]naphtho[l,2-b]pyran) comprises a photochromic naphthopyran with<br>
a reactive substituent corresponding to -D-J. According to this non-limiting<br>
embodiment, the photochromic material may be purified by crystallization with an<br>
ethyl acetate/hexanes mixture to yield purple-tinted crystals. In another non-limiting<br>
embodiment set forth in Example 5, the photochromic material (i.e., 3-phenyl-3-(4-<br>
(4-(2-methacryloxyethyl)carbamylpiperazin-1 -yl)phenyl)-6,11 -dimethoxy-13,13-<br>
dimethyl-3H,13H-indeno[2',3':3,4]naphtho[l,2-b]pyran) comprises a photochromic<br>
naphthopyran with a reactive substituent corresponding to -D-J. According to this<br>
non-limiting embodiment, the photochromic material may be purified by silica gel<br>
chromatography to yield a green expanded foam solid. In other non-limiting<br>
embodiments, an intermediate in the synthesis of the photochromic material may be<br>
readily purified by recrystallization methods, chromatographic methods or other<br>
methods of purification know to one skilled in the art.<br>
[046] Bonding between the various linking group(s) and the group -J will now be<br>
discussed. According to various non-limiting embodiments disclosed herein, the<br>
group -J may be bonded to the linking group by a G-J bond or a D-J bond. In certain<br>
VTN5080<br><br>
-30-<br>
non-limiting embodiments where the reactive moiety -J is bonded to the linking<br>
group by a G-J bond, the G-J bond may have many possible structures. For<br>
example, when -J is acryl, methacryl, or crotyl, the G-J bond may be an ester bond,<br>
that is, a terminal oxygen residue of the -G- group bonds with the carbonyl of the -J<br>
group. Alternatively, when -J is 2-(methacryloxy)ethylcarbamyl or 2-<br>
(methacryloxy)ethoxycarbonyl, the G-J bond may be a carbamate and carbonate<br>
bond, respectively, where a terminal oxygen residue of the -G- group bonds with the<br>
carbonyl of the ethyl carbamyl or ethoxycarbonyl portion of the -J group. Further,<br>
when -J is 4-vinylphenyl, vinyl, 1-chlorovinyl or epoxy, the G-J bond may be an<br>
ether bond between a terminal oxygen residue of the -G- group and the carbon of the<br>
-J group. In certain non-limiting embodiments, the -J group may be a hydrogen,<br>
such that the G-J bond is an oxygen-hydrogen bond resulting in a reactive moiety,<br>
i.e., a hydroxyl group, on the linking group.<br>
[047] In other non-limiting embodiments where the reactive moiety -J is bonded to<br>
the linking group by a D-J bond, the D-J bond may have many possible structures.<br>
For example, when -J is acryl, methacryl, or crotyl, the D-J bond may be an ester or<br>
amide bond, that is, an alcohol oxygen or an amine nitrogen on the amino alcohol<br>
residue or diamine residue of the -D- group bonds with the carbonyl of the -J group.<br>
Alternatively, when -J is 2-(methacryloxy)ethylcarbamyl or 2-<br>
(methacryloxy)ethoxycarbonyl, the D-J bond may be a urea, carbamate, or carbonate<br>
bond, where an amine nitrogen on the diamine residue or amino alcohol residue, or<br>
an alcohol oxygen on the amino alcohol residue of the -D- group bonds with the<br>
carbonyl of the ethylcarbamyl or ethoxycarbonyl portion of the -J- group. Further,<br>
when -J is 4-vinylphenyl, vinyl, 1-chlorovinyl or epoxy, the D-J may be an amine or<br>
ether bond between an amine nitrogen or the alcohol oxygen, respectively, of the -D-<br>
group and the carbon of the -J group. In certain non-limiting embodiments, when -<br>
D- is an amino alcohol, the - J group may be a hydrogen bonded to the oxygen of the<br>
amino alcohol residue, such that the D-J bond is an oxygen-hydrogen bond, resulting<br>
in a reactive moiety, i.e., a hydroxyl group, on the linking group.<br>
VTN5080<br><br>
-31-<br>
[048] According to various non-limiting embodiments disclosed herein, wherein -J<br>
is acryl, methacryl, 2-(methacryloxy)ethylcarbamyl or epoxy, -J may be attached to<br>
the -D- or -G- group of the linking group by condensation of-D- or -G- with<br>
acryloyl chloride, methacryloyl chloride, 2-isocyanatoethyl methacrylate or<br>
epichlorohydrin, respectively.<br>

moiety. Non-limiting examples of -J, according to certain non-limiting<br>
embodiments include acryl, crotyl, methacryl, 2-(methacryloxy)ethylcarbamyl, 2-<br>
(methacryloxy)ethoxycarbonyl, 4-vinylphenyl, vinyl, 1-chlorovinyl, and epoxy.<br>
[051] As discussed with respect to the various non-limiting embodiments set forth<br>
above, the reactive substituent R according to this non-limiting embodiment may be<br>
bonded to the photochromic naphthopyran PC in a variety of positions. For<br>
example, when PC is a 2H-naphtho[l,2-b]pyran or a 3H-naphtho[2,l-b]pyran, a<br>
VTN5080<br><br>
-32-<br>
reactive substituent R may be bonded at any of the positions numbered 5 through 10<br>
according to structures 1 or 2 above. When PC is an indeno[2',3':3,4]naphtho[l,2-<br>

bonded at any of the positions numbered 5 through 13 according to structures 3 or 4<br>
above. In addition or alternatively, when PC is a 2H-naphtho[l,2-b]pyran, a 3H-<br>
naphtho[2,l-b]pyran naphthopyran, an indeno[2',3':3,4]naphtho [l,2-b]pyran or an<br>
indeno[l',2':4,3]riaphtho[2,l-b]pyran, a reactive substituent R may be bonded to<br>
group B and/or group B'.<br>
[052] Further, as indicated above, the photochromic materials according to various<br>
non-limiting embodiments disclosed herein may comprises one reactive substituent<br>

or different. For example, according to one non-limiting embodiment wherein r is 2,<br>
the photochromic materials comprise two reactive substituents R, which may be the<br>
same or different, and which may be bonded to the photochromic naphthopyran PC<br>
at two of the numbered positions set forth above, at one of the numbered positions<br>
and on one of the B or B' groups, or both R substituents may be bonded to the<br>
photochromic naphthopyran PC at the B and/or B' group.<br>

polymerized with" means that the photochromic material is linked to a portion of the<br>
polymeric material by reacting as a co-monomer in the polymerization reaction of<br>
the host monomers that result in the polymeric material. For example, photochromic<br>
materials according to various non-limiting embodiments herein have a reactive<br>
substituent that comprises a polymerizable moiety that may react as a co-monomer<br>
during the polymerization of the host monomers.<br>
[082] Polymeric materials suitable for the various non-limiting embodiments of the<br>
present disclosure include those suitable for the production of ophthalmic devices.<br>
[083] Further, according to various non-limiting embodiments at least a portion of<br>
the ophthalmic device is transparent. For example, according to various non-<br>
limiting embodiments, the ophthalmic device may be formed from an optically clear<br>
polymeric material. According to one specific non-limiting embodiment, the<br>
polymeric material is formed from a mixture comprising polymerizable and<br>
optionally non-polymerizable ophthalmic device forming components which are<br>
known in the art to be useful for forming ophthalmic devices, such as contact lenses.<br>
More specifically, suitable components include polymerizable monomers,<br>
prepolymers and macromers, wetting agents, UV absorbing compounds,<br>

[084] According to one specific non-limiting embodiment, the ophthalmic device<br>
forming components preferably form a hydrogel upon polymerization and hydration.<br>
A hydrogel is a hydrated, crosslinked polymeric system that contains water in an<br>
equilibrium state. Hydrogels typically are oxygen permeable and biocompatible,<br>
making them preferred materials for producing ophthalmic devices and in particular<br>
contact and intraocular lenses.<br>
[085] Ophthalmic device forming components are known in the art and include<br>
polymerizable monomers, prepolymers and macromers which contain polymerizable<br>
group(s) and performance groups which provide the resulting polymeric material<br>
with desirable properties. Suitable performance groups include but are not limited to<br>
hydrophilic groups, oxygen permeability enhancing groups, UV or visible light<br>
absorbing groups, combinations thereof and the like.<br>
[086] The term "monomer" used herein refers to low molecular weight compounds<br>
(i.e. typically having number average molecular weights less than about 700).<br>
Prepolymers are medium to high molecular weight compounds or polymers (having<br>
repeating structural units and a number average molecular weight greater than about<br>
700) containing functional groups capable of further polymerization. Macromers are<br>
uncrosslinked polymers which are capable of cross-linking or further<br>
polymerization.<br>
[087] One suitable class of ophthalmic device forming components includes<br>
hydrophilic components, which are capable of providing at least about 20% and<br>
preferably at least about 25% water content to the resulting lens when combined<br>
with the remaining components. The hydrophilic components that may be used to<br>
make the polymers of this invention are monomers having at least one<br>
polymerizable double bond and at least one hydrophilic functional group. Examples<br>
of polymerizable double bonds include acrylic, methacrylic, acrylamido,<br>
methacrylamido, fumaric, maleic, styryl, isopropenylphenyl, O-vinylcarbonate, O-<br>
vinylcarbamate, allylic, O-vinylacetyl and N-vinyllactam and N-vinylamido double<br>
bonds. Non-limiting examples of hydrophilic monomers having acrylic and<br>

[088] Non-limiting examples of hydrophilic monomers having N-vinyl lactam and<br>
N-vinylamide polymerizable double bonds include N-vinyl pyrrolidone (NVP), N-<br>
vinyl-N-methyl acetamide, N-vinyl-N-ethyl acetamide, N-vinyl-N-ethyl formamide,<br>
N-vinyl formamide, N-2-hydroxyethyl vinyl carbamate, N-carboxy-B-alanine N-<br>
vinyl ester, with NVP and N-vinyl-N-methyl acetamide being preferred. Polymers<br>
formed from these monomers may also be included.<br>
[089] Other hydrophilic monomers that can be employed in the invention include<br>
polyoxyethylene polyols having one or more of the terminal hydroxyl groups<br>
replaced with a functional group containing a polymerizable double bond.<br>
[090] Still further examples are the hydrophilic vinyl carbonate or vinyl carbamate<br>
monomers disclosed in U.S. Pat. No.5,070,215, and the hydrophilic oxazolone<br>
monomers disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,190,277. Other suitable hydrophilic<br>
monomers will be apparent to one skilled in the art.<br>
[091] Preferred hydrophilic monomers which may be incorporated into the<br>
polymerizable mixture of the present invention include hydrophilic monomers such<br>
as N,N-dimethyl acrylamide (DMA), 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl<br>
methacrylate (HEMA), glycerol methacrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylamide, N-<br>

monomethacrylate and mixtures thereof.<br>
[092] Most preferred hydrophilic monomers include HEMA, DMA, NVP, N-vinyl-<br>

[093] The above references hydrophilic monomers are suitable for the production<br>
of conventional contact lenses such as those made from to etafilcon, polymacon,<br>
vifilcon, genfilcon A and lenefilcon A and the like. For a conventional contact lens<br>
the amount of hydrophilic monomer incorporated into the polymerizable mixture is<br>
VTN5080<br><br>
-51-<br>
at least about 70 weight % and preferably at least about 80 weight %, based upon the<br>
weight of all the components in the polymerizable mixture.<br>
[094] In another non-limiting embodiment, suitable contact lenses may be made<br>
from polymeric materials having increased permeability to oxygen, such as<br>
galyfilcon A, senofilcon A, balafilcon, lotrafilcon A and B and the like. The<br>
polymerization mixtures used to form these and other materials having increased<br>
permeability to oxygen, generally include one or more of the hydrophilic monomers<br>
listed above, with at least one silicone containing component.<br>
[095] A silicone-containing component is one that contains at least one [—Si—<br>
O—Si] group, in a monomer, macromer or prepolymer. Preferably, the Si and<br>
attached O are present in the silicone-containing component in an amount greater<br>
than 20 weight percent, and more preferably greater than 30 weight percent of the<br>
total molecular weight of the silicone-containing component. Useful silicone-<br>
containing components preferably comprise polymerizable functional groups such as<br>
acrylate, methacrylate, acrylamide, methacrylamide, N-vinyl lactam, N-vinylamide,<br>
and styryl functional groups. Examples of silicone-containing components which<br>

[107] Various non-limiting embodiments disclosed herein provide photochromic<br>
ophthalmic devices comprising a photochromic material according to any of the<br>
non-limiting embodiments discussed above connected to a portion of the ophthalmic<br>
device. As used herein, the term "connected to" means associated with, either<br>
directly or indirectly through another material or structure.<br>
[108] For example and without limitation, the photochromic materials disclosed<br>
herein may be connected to at least a portion of the ophthalmic device, such as by<br>
bonding the photochromic materials to at least a portion of the material from which<br>
the ophthalmic device is made, for example by co-polymerizing or otherwise<br>
bonding the photochromic materials with the ophthalmic device material; blending<br>
the photochromic materials with the ophthalmic device material; or coating the<br>
photochromic materials on at least a portion of a surface of the ophthalmic device.<br>
VTN5080<br><br>
-57-<br>
Alternatively, the photochromic material may be connected to at least a portion of<br>
the ophthalmic device such as through an intermediate coating, film or layer.<br>
[109] According to various non-limiting embodiments disclosed herein, the<br>
photochromic material may be connected to at least a portion of the ophthalmic<br>
device by incorporating the photochromic material into at least a portion of the<br>
polymeric material of the ophthalmic device, or at least a portion of the oligomeric<br>
or monomeric material from which the ophthalmic device is formed. For example,<br>
according to one non-limiting embodiment, the photochromic material may be<br>
incorporated into the polymeric material of the ophthalmic device by the cast-in-<br>
place method. Additionally or alternatively, the photochromic material may be<br>
connected with at least a portion of the polymeric material of the ophthalmic device<br>
by imbibition. Imbibition and the cast-in-place method are discussed below.<br>
[110] For example, according to one non-limiting embodiment, the ophthalmic<br>
device comprises a polymeric material and a photochromic material is bonded to at<br>
least a portion of the polymeric material. According to another non-limiting<br>
embodiment, the ophthalmic device comprises a polymeric material and a<br>

that are useful in forming the substrates according to various non-limiting<br>
embodiments disclosed herein are set forth above in detail.<br>
[Ill] According to other non-limiting embodiments, the photochromic material<br>
may be connected to at least a portion of the ophthalmic device of the photochromic<br>
article as part of an at least partial coating that is connected to at least a portion of<br>
the ophthalmic device. Further, the photochromic material may be incorporated into<br>
at least a portion of the coating composition prior to application of the coating<br>
composition to the ophthalmic device, or alternatively, a coating composition may<br>
be applied to the substrate, at least partially set, and thereafter the photochromic<br>
VTN5080<br><br>
-58-<br>
material may be imbibed into at least a portion of the coating. As used herein, the<br>
terms "set" and "setting" include, without limitation, curing, polymerizing, cross-<br>
linking, cooling, and drying.<br>
[112] For example, in one non-limiting embodiment of the present disclosure, the<br>
ophthalmic device may comprise an at least partial coating of a polymeric material<br>
connected to at least a portion of a surface thereof. According to this non-limiting<br>
embodiment, the photochromic material may be blended with at least a portion of<br>
the polymeric material of the at least partial coating, or the photochromic material<br>
may be bonded to at least a portion of the polymeric material of the at least partial<br>
coating. ,According to one specific no-limiting embodiment, the photochromic<br>
material may be co-polymerized with at least a portion of the polymeric material of<br>
the at least partial coating.<br>
[113] The at least partial coating comprising a photochromic material may be<br>
directly connected to the ophthalmic device, for example, by directly applying a<br>
coating composition comprising a photochromic material to at least a portion of a<br>
surface of the ophthalmic device, and at least partially setting the coating<br>
composition. Additionally or alternatively, the at least partial coating comprising a<br>
photochromic material may be connected to the ophthalmic device, for example,<br>
through one or more additional coatings. For example, while not limiting herein,<br>
according to various non-limiting embodiments, an additional coating composition<br>
may be applied to at least a portion of the surface of the ophthalmic device, at least<br>
partially set, and thereafter the coating composition comprising a photochromic<br>
material may be applied over the additional coating and at least partially set.<br>
[114] Non-limiting examples of additional coatings and films that may be used in<br>
conjunction with the ophthalmic device disclosed herein include conventional<br>
photochromic coating and films; ophthalmically compatible coatings including clear<br>
coats, hydrophilic coatings, combinations thereof; and the like.<br>
VTN5080<br><br>
-59-<br>
[115] Non-limiting examples of conventional photochromic coatings and films<br>
include, but are not limited to, coatings and films comprising conventional<br>
photochromic materials.<br>
[116] The present disclosure also contemplates various methods of making<br>
ophthalmic devices comprising connecting a photochromic material, according to<br>
the various non-limiting embodiments disclosed herein, to at least a portion of an<br>
ophthalmic device. For example, in one non-limiting embodiment, connecting the<br>
photochromic material to at least a portion of the ophthalmic device may comprise<br>
blending the photochromic material with at least a portion of the polymeric material<br>
used to form the ophthalmic device. In another non-limiting embodiment,<br>
connecting the photochromic material to at least a portion of the ophthalmic device<br>
may comprise bonding the photochromic material to at least a portion of the<br>
polymeric material of the ophthalmic device. For example in one non-limiting<br>
embodiment, connecting the photochromic material to at least a portion of the<br>
ophthalmic device may comprise co-polymerizing the photochromic material with at<br>
least a portion of the polymeric material used to form the ophthalmic device. Non-<br>
limiting methods of connecting photochromic materials to a polymeric material<br>
include, for example, mixing the photochromic material into a solution or melt of a<br>
polymeric, oligomeric, or monomeric material, and subsequently at least partially<br>
setting the polymeric, oligomeric, or monomeric material. It will be appreciated by<br>
those skilled in the art that, according to this non-limiting embodiment, in the<br>
resultant photochromic composition, the photochromic materials may be blended<br>
with the polymeric material (i.e., intermixed with but not bonded to) or bonded to<br>
the polymeric material. For example, if the photochromic material contains a<br>
polymerizable group that is compatible with the polymeric, oligomeric, or monomer<br>
material, during setting of the organic material the photochromic material can be<br>
reacted with at least a portion thereof to bond the photochromic material thereto.<br>
[117] In another non-limiting embodiment, connecting the photochromic material<br>
to at least a portion of the ophthalmic device may comprise imbibing the<br>
VTN5080<br><br>
-60-<br>
photochromic material with at least a portion of the polymeric material of the<br>
ophthalmic device. According to this non-limiting embodiment, the photochromic<br>
material may be caused to diffuse into the polymeric material, for example, by<br>
immersing an ophthalmic device comprising a polymeric material in a solution<br>
containing the photochromic material, with or with out heating. In another non-<br>
limiting embodiment, the connecting the photochromic material to at least a portion<br>
of the ophthalmic device may comprise a combination of two or more of blending,<br>
bonding (for example co-polymerizing), and imbibing the photochromic material<br>
to/with at least a portion of the polymeric material of the ophthalmic device.<br>
[118] According to one non-limiting embodiment of the methods, wherein the<br>
substrate comprises a polymeric material, incorporating the photochromic material<br>
with at least a portion of a substrate comprises a cast-in-place method. According to<br>
this non-limiting embodiment, the photochromic material may be mixed with a<br>
polymeric solution or melt, or other oligomeric and/or monomeric solution or<br>
mixture, which is subsequently cast into a molding having a desired shape and at<br>
least partially set to form the ophthalmic device. Further, although not required<br>
according to this non-limiting embodiment, a photochromic material can be bonded<br>
to the polymeric material.<br>
[119] According to another non-limiting embodiment of the methods, wherein the<br>
ophthalmic device comprises a polymeric material, connecting the photochromic<br>
material to at least a portion of an ophthalmic device comprises in-mold casting.<br>
According to this non-limiting embodiment, a coating composition comprising the<br>
photochromic material, which may be a liquid coating composition, is applied to the<br>
surface of a mold and at least partially set. Thereafter, a polymer solution or melt, or<br>
oligomer or monomeric solution or mixture is cast over the coating and at least<br>
partially set. After setting, the ophthalmic device with the coating is removed from<br>
the mold.<br>
[120] According to still another non-limiting embodiment of the methods,<br>
connecting the photochromic material to at least a portion of a ophthalmic device<br>
VTN5080<br><br>
-61-<br>
comprises applying an at least partial coating comprising the photochromic material<br>
to at least a portion of the ophthalmic device. Non-limiting examples of suitable<br>
coating methods include dip coating, spin coating, spray coating (e.g., using a liquid<br>
coating), curtain coating, roll coating, spin and spray coating, over-molding, and the<br>
like. For example, according to one non-limiting embodiment, the photochromic<br>
material may be connected to the ophthalmic device by over-molding. According to<br>
this non-limiting embodiment, a coating composition comprising the photochromic<br>
material (which may be a liquid coating composition as previously discussed) is<br>
applied to a mold and the ophthalmic device is then placed into the mold such that<br>
the ophthalmic device contacts the coating causing it to spread over at least a portion<br>
of the surface of the ophthalmic device. Thereafter, the coating composition is at<br>
least partially set and the coated ophthalmic device is removed from the mold.<br>
Alternatively, over-molding may be done by placing the ophthalmic device into a<br>
mold such that an open region is defined between the ophthalmic device and the<br>
mold, and thereafter injecting a coating composition comprising the photochromic<br>
material into the open region. Thereafter, the coating composition can be at least<br>
partially set and the coated ophthalmic device is removed from the mold.<br>
[121] Further, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the<br>
photochromic compositions, photochromic ophthalmic devices, and photochromic<br>
coating compositions according to various non-limiting embodiments disclosed<br>
herein may further comprise other additives that aid in the processing and/or<br>
performance of the composition. For example, and without limitation, such<br>
additives may include complementary photochromic materials, photoinitiators,<br>
thermal initiators, polymerization inhibitors, solvents, light stabilizers (such as, but<br>
not limited to, ultraviolet light absorbers and light stabilizers, such as hindered<br>
amine light stabilizers (HALS)), heat stabilizers, mold release agents, rheology<br>
control agents, leveling agents (such as, but not limited to, surfactants), free radical<br>
scavengers, or adhesion promoters (such as hexanediol diacrylate and coupling<br>
agents).<br>
VTN5080<br><br>
-62-<br>
[122] Each of the photochromic materials described herein may be used in amounts<br>
(or in a ratio) such that a ophthalmic device or a polymeric material to which the<br>
photochromic material is associated, i.e., blended, co-polymerized, or otherwise<br>
bonded, coated and/or imbibed, exhibits a desired resultant color, e.g., substantially<br>
clear and colorless when the photochromic material is in the closed form and<br>
substantially colored when activated by actinic radiation and the photochromic<br>
material is in the open form.<br>
[123] The amount of the photochromic naphthopyrans of the present disclosure to<br>
be connected to or incorporated into a coating composition, polymeric material,<br>
ophthalmic device, and/or photochromic composition, is not critical provided that a<br>
sufficient amount is used to produce the desired optical effect. Generally, such<br>
amount may be described as a "photochromic amount". The particular amount of<br>
photochromic material used may depend on a variety of factors such as, the<br>
absorption characteristics of the photochromic material used, the intensity of color<br>
desired upon irradiation thereof, and the method used to incorporate or apply the<br>
photochromic material.<br>
[124] The relative amounts of the aforesaid photochromic materials used in the<br>
various methods of the non-limiting embodiments of the present disclosure will vary<br>
and depend, in part, upon the relative intensities of the color of the activated species<br>
of such materials, the ultimate color desired, the molar absorption coefficient (of<br>
"extinction coefficient") for actinic radiation, and the method of application to the<br>
polymeric material or substrate. Generally, the amount of total photochromic<br>
material incorporated into or connected to a polymeric material or ophthalmic device<br>
may range from about 0.05 to about 5.0 milligrams per square centimeter of the<br>
surface to which the photochromic material is incorporated into or connected to.<br>
The amount of photochromic material incorporated into or connected to a coating<br>
composition may range from 0.1 to 40 weight percent based on the weight of the<br>
liquid coating composition. The amount of photochromic material incorporated<br>
into, i.e., blended with, co-polymerized with, or bonded to, a host polymer<br>

photochromic composition or photochromic ophthalmic device, such as by a in cast-<br>
in-place type method, may range from 0.01 to 40 weight percent based on the weight<br>
of the polymeric composition or photochromic ophthalmic device.<br>

Example 10: Synthesis of Photochromic Polymer Test Square and Photochromic<br>
Performance Testing<br>
Photochromic Performance Testing<br>
[155] The photochromic performance of the photochromic materials of Examples<br>
1-9 was tested as follows.<br>
[156] A quantity of the photochromic material to be tested calculated to yield a 1.5<br>
x 10-3 molal solution was added to a flask containing 50 grams of a monomer blend<br>
of 4 parts ethoxylated bisphenol A dimethacrylate (BPA 2EO DMA), 1 part<br>
poly(ethylene glycol) 600 dimethacrylate, and 0.033 weight percent 2,2'-azobis(2-<br>
methyl propionitrile) (AIBN). The photochromic material was dissolved into the<br>
VTN5080<br><br>
-73-<br>
monomer blend by stirring and gentle heating. After a clear solution was obtained,<br>
it was poured into a flat sheet mold having the interior dimensions of 2.2 mm x 6<br>
inches (15.24 cm) x 6 inches (15.24 cm). The mold was sealed and placed in a<br>
horizontal airflow, programmable oven programmed to increase the temperature<br>
from 40°C to 95°C over a 5 hour interval, hold the temperature at 95°C for 3 hours<br>
and then lower it to 60°C for at least 2 hours. The methacrylate terminated<br>
photochromic dyes were copolymerized into the sheet after this period of time.<br>
After the mold was opened, the polymer sheet was cut using a diamond blade saw<br>
into 2 inch (5.1 cm) test squares.<br>
[157] The photochromic test squares prepared as described above were tested for<br>
photochromic response on an optical bench. Prior to testing on the optical bench,<br>
the photochromic test squares were exposed to 365 nm ultraviolet light for about 15<br>
minutes to cause the photochromic material to transform from the unactivated (or<br>
bleached) state to an activated (or colored) state, and then placed in a 76°C oven for<br>
about 15 minutes to allow the photochromic material to revert back to the bleached<br>
state. The test squares were then cooled to room temperature, exposed to fluorescent<br>
room lighting for at least 2 hours, and then kept covered (that is, in a dark<br>
environment) for at least 2 hours prior to testing on an optical bench maintained at<br>
24°C. The bench was fitted with a 300-watt xenon arc lamp, a remote controlled<br>
shutter, a KG-2 filter acting as a heat sink for the arc lamp, and neutral density<br>
filter(s). The sample holder in which the square to be tested was situated in a water<br>
bath which was kept at 23 °C. A collimated beam of light from a tungsten lamp was<br>
passed through the square at a small angle (approximately 30°) normal to the square.<br>
After passing through the square, the light from the tungsten lamp was directed to a<br>
collection sphere, avoiding collecting scattered light and reblend light beam. From<br>
the collection sphere the light travels via a fiber optic cable to an Ocean Optics<br>
S2000 spectrophotometer where the resulting spectrum was measured at the visible<br>
lambda max ("λmax-ViS") of the photochromic material being tested. The X,max-vis is the<br>
wavelength in the visible spectrum at which the maximum absorption of the<br>
VTN5080<br><br>
-74-<br>
activated (colored) form of the photochromic compound in a test square occurs. The<br>
λmax-vis wavelength was determined by testing the photochromic test squares in a<br>
Varian Cary 4000 UV-Visible spectrophotometer. The output signals from the<br>
detector were processed by a radiometer.<br>
[158] The saturated optical density ("Sat'd OD") for each test square was<br>
determined by opening the shutter from the xenon lamp and measuring the<br>
transmittance after exposing the test chip to UV radiation for 30 minutes. The xenon<br>
beam is set to 1 W/m2 for measurements of this class of dyes, however, in some<br>
instances, a power setting of 3 W/m2 was used. Irradiance was adjusted by varying<br>
the neutral density filter at the light source and by adjusting lamp output. The First<br>
Fade Half Life ("T1/2") is the time interval in seconds for the absorbance of the<br>
activated form of the photochromic material in the test squares to reach one half the<br>
Sat'd OD absorbance value at room temperature (24°C), after removal of the source<br>
of activating light. Results for the photochromic materials tested are listed below in<br>

.omega.-hydroxy-, ether with methyl D-glucopyranoside, Ave. MW 1074 g/mole in<br>
a ratio of 50 weight parts, commercially available from Chemron Corporation) to 50<br>
weight parts reactive monomers, and placed into each front curve mold. Back curve<br>
molds were placed onto the front curve molds and lenses were formed by curing the<br>
mixture under visible light from fluorescent bulbs (Philips TLK03/40W) for about<br>
20 minutes at about 50°C. The molds were removed from the light and placed in an<br>
oven that was heated to 70°C for about 3 hours. The molds were removed from the<br>
oven and promptly pried open while still hot. The lenses were released from the<br>
molds by immersing them in an aqueous solution of 0.16 weight % disodium EDTA<br>
and 0.02 weight % Tween® 80 (polyoxyethylene(20) sorbitan monooleate,<br>
commercially available from Aldrich Chemicals) at about 70°C for about 30<br>
minutes. The lenses were rinsed in borate-buffered saline solution. The final lenses<br>
were uniform in shape.<br>
