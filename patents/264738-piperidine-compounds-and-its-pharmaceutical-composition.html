				<td>The present invention relates to Piperidine and Azet dine Derivatives as GLYT1 Inhibitors and directed to heterocyclic sulfonyl azetidines and piperidines as GlyTl inhibitors, particularly for use in the treatment of schizophrenia.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Schizophrenia    is     a     debilitating    psychiatric     disorder<br>
characterized by a combination of negative (blunted affect, withdrawal, anhedonia) and positive (paranoia, hallucinations, delusions) symptoms as well as marked cognitive deficits. While the etiology of schizophrenia is currently unknown, the disease appears to be produced by a complex interaction of biological, environmental, and genetic factors. Over 40 years ago it was found that phencyclidine (PCP) induces a psychotic state in humans that is very similar to that observed in schizophrenic patients. The finding that the main mode of action of PCP is that of a non-competitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptor stimulated a series of studies that have led to the development of the NMDA receptor hypofunction model of schizophrenia (Jentsch JD and Roth RH, 1999 Neuropsychopharmacology, 20:201). In contrast, 4 genes have been cloned for the NR2 subunit (NR2A, NR2B, NR2C, and NR2D), some of which exhibit alternative splicing (Hollmann M and Heinemann S, 1994, Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 17:31). Interestingly, the binding sites for these two co-agonists exist on separate subunits as determined by site-directed mutagenesis studies (Laube B, Hirai H, Sturgess M, Betz H and Kuhse J, 1997, Neuron 18:493). On the NR2A and NR2B subunits, a binding pocket for glutamate is formed by interactions between the N-terminus of the receptor and the extracellular loops. In addition, the pore of the NMDA receptor is impermeable to magnesium. Under normal resting conditions, extracellular magnesium can bind to a site within the pore and produce a magnesium block of the channel. This magnesium block imparts a strong voltage dependence to the channel which allows the NMDA receptor to act as a coincidence detector requiring the binding of glutamate, glycine, and the occurrence of postsynaptic depolarization before conducting current. Of particular interest is the finding that the psychotomimetic drugs MK-801, PCP, and ketamine all act as open channel blockers of the NMDA receptor-channel by binding to a site that overlaps with the magnesium binding site. It is apparent that the rich diversity of NMDA receptor subunits and regulatory sites provides for a complex assortment of physiologically and pharmacologically distinct heteromeric receptors making the NMDA<br>
receptor an ideal target for the design of novel the apeutic compounds.<br>
The NMDA receptor plays a critical role in a variety of neurophysiological phenomena, including but not limited to synaptic plasticity, cognition, attention and memory (Bliss T and Collingridge W, 1993, Nature 361:31; Morris RGM et al., 1986, Nature 319:774). Psychotomimetic drugs constitute a wide class of drugs including psychomotor stimulants (cocaine, amphetamine), hallucinogens (LSD), and NMDA receptor antagonists (PCP, ketamine). Of these, only the NMDA receptor antagonists appear to elicit a robust induction of the positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. Controlled studies of ketamine-induced psychosis in human subjects, as well as observations of symptoms from patients abusing PCP as a recreational drug, have produced a convincing list of similarities between NMDA receptor antagonist-induced psychosis and schizophrenia (Jentsch JD and Roth RH, 1999 Neuropsychopharmacology, 20:201)DFQUOTE "" implicates NMDA receptor hypofunction in this disorder, and indicate that increasing NMDA receptor activation may provide a therapeutic benefit (Leiderman E et al., 1996, Biol. Psychiatry 39:213, Javitt DC et al., 1994, Am. J. Psychiatry 151:1234, Heresco-Levy U, 2000, Int. J. Neuropsychopharmacol. 3:243, Tsai G et al., 1998, Biol. Psychiatry 44:1081). A large number of studies in animal models lend support to the NMDA hypofunction hypothesis of schizophrenia. Recent generation of a mutant mouse expressing only 5% of normal levels of the NMDA NR1 subunit have shown that this decrease in functional NMDA receptors induces a state very similar to that observed in other animal models of schizophrenia (Mohn AR et al., 1999, Cell 98:427). Besides schizophrenia, dysfunction of glutamatergic pathways has been implicated in a number of disease states in the human central nervous system (CNS) including but not limited to cognitive deficits, dementia, Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease and bipolar disorder.<br>
NMDA receptor function can be modulated by altering the availability of the co-agonist glycine. This approach has the critical advantage of maintaining activity-dependent activation of the NMDA receptor because an increase in the synaptic concentration of glycine will not produce an activation of NMDA receptors in the absence of glutamate. Since synaptic glutamate levels are tightly maintained by high affinity transport mechanisms, an increased activation of the glycine site will only enhance the NMDA component of activated synapses. Clinical trials in which high doses of glycine were administered orally as an add-on to standard neuroleptic therapy showed an<br>
improvement of the symptoms of schizophrenia patients (Javitt et al. Int. J. Neuropsychopharmacol. (2001) 4: 385-391). One way to increase synaptic glycine levels without administering exogenous glycine is to inhibit its removal from the synapse. Evidence that this approach would be useful in treating schizophrenia comes from a double-blind placebo controlled study in which sarcosine was administered to patients suffering from schizophrenia, but who were poorly responsive to antipsychotic drugs. A beneficial effect was observed on positive, negative and cognitive symptoms, indicating that inhibition of glycine re-uptake is a reasonable approach to the treatment of schizophrenia.<br>
Two specific glycine transporters, GlyTl and GlyT2 have been identified and shown to belong to the Na+/C-  dependent family of neurotransmitter transporters which includes taurine, '-aminobutyric acid (GABA), proline, monoamines and orphan transporters (Smith KE et al., 1992, Neuron 8:927; Borowsky B et al., 1993, Neuron 10:851; Liu QR et al., 1993, J. Biol. Chem. 268:22802; Kim KM et al., 1994, Mol. Pharmacol. 45:608; Morrow JA et al., 1998, FEBS Lett. 439:334; Nelson N, 1998, J. Neurochem. 71:1785). GlyTl and GlyT2 have been isolated from different species and shown to have only 50% identity at the amino acid level. They also have a different pattern of expression in mammalian central nervous system with GlyT2 being expressed in spinal cord, brainstem and cerebellum and GlyTl present in these regions as well as forebrain areas such as cortex, hippocampus, septum and thalamus (Smith KE et al., 1992, Neuron 8:927; Borowsky B et al., 1993, Neuron 10:851; Liu QR et al., 1993, J. Biol. Chem. 268:22802). At the cellular level, GlyT2 has been reported to be expressed by glycinergic nerve endings in rat spinal cord whereas GlyTl appears to be preferentially expressed by glial cells (Zafra F et al., 1995, J. Neurosci. 15:3952). These expression studies have led to the conclusion that GlyT2 is predominantly responsible for glycine uptake at glycinergic synapses whereas GlyTl is involved in monitoring glycine concentration in the vicinity of NMDA receptor expressing synapses. Recent functional studies in rat have shown that blockade of GlyTl with the potent inhibitor (N-[3-(4'-fluorophenyl)-3-(4'-phenylphenoxy)propyl])sarcosine (NFPS) potentiates NMDA receptor activity and NMDA receptor-dependent long-term potentiation in rat (Bergeron R et al., 1998, PNAS USA 95:15730; Kinney G et al., 2003, J. Neurosci. 23:7586). Furthermore, NFPS has been reported to enhance pre-pulse inhibition in mice, a measure of sensory gating that is known to be deficient in schizophrenia patients (Kinney G et al.,<br>
2003, J, Neurosci. 23:7586). These physiological effects of GlyTl in forebrain regions together with clinical reports showing the beneficial effects of GlyTl inhibitor sarcosine in improving symptoms in schizophrenia patients (Tsai and Coyle WO99/52519) indicate that selective GlyTl uptake inhibitors represent a new class of antipsychotic drugs.<br>

The compounds of the present invention may contain one or more chiral centers and can thus occur as racemates and racemic mixtures, single enantiomers, diastereomeric mixtures and individual diastereomers. Additional asymmetric centers may be present depending upon the nature of the various substituents on the molecule. Each such asymmetric center will independently produce two optical isomers and it is intended that all of the possible optical isomers and diastereomers in mixtures and as pure or partially purified compounds are included within the ambit of this invention. The present invention is meant to comprehend all such isomeric forms of these compounds. Formula I shows the structure of the class of compounds without preferred stereochemistry.<br>
The independent syntheses of these diastereomers or their chromatographic separations may be achieved as known in the art by appropriate modification of the methodology disclosed herein. Their absolute stereochemistry may be determined by the x-ray crystallography of crystalline products or crystalline intermediates which are derivatized, if necessary, with a reagent containing an asymmetric center of known absolute configuration.<br><br>
If desired, racemic mixtures of the compounds may be separated so that the individual enantiomers are isolated. The separation can be carried out by methods well known in the art, such as the coupling of a racemic mixture of compounds to an enantiomerically pure compound to form a diastereomeric mixture, followed by separation of the individual diastereomers by standard methods, such as fractional crystallization or chromatography. The coupling reaction is often the formation of salts using an enantiomerically pure acid or base. The diasteromeric derivatives may then be converted to the pure enantiomers by cleavage of the added chiral residue. The racemic mixture of the compounds can also be separated directly by chromatographic methods utilizing chiral stationary phases, which methods are well known in the art.<br>
Alternatively, any enantiomer of a compound may be obtained by stereoselective synthesis using optically pure starting materials or reagents of known configuration by methods well known in the art.<br>

The utility of the compounds in accordance with the present invention as inhibiting the glycine transporter activity, in particular GlyTl activity, may be demonstrated by methodology known in the art. Human placental choriocarcinoma cells (JAR cells (ATCC No. HTB-144)) endogenously expressing GlyTl were cultured in 96-well Cytostar scintillating microplates (Amersham Biosciences) in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum in the presence of penicillin (100 micrograms/milliliter) and streptomycin (100 micrograms/ milliliter). Cells were grown at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 40-48 hours before the assay. Culture medium was removed from the Cytostar plate, and JAR cells were incubated with 30 microliters of TB1A buffer (120 mM NaCl, 2 mM KC1,1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2,10 mM HEPES, 5 mM L-alanine, pH 7.5 adjusted with Tris base) with or without the compounds of the present invention for 1 minute. Then 30 microliters of [l4C]-glycine diluted with TB1A was added to each well to give a final concentration of 10 micromolar. After incubation at room temperature for 3 hours, the Cytostar scintillating microplates were sealed and counted on a Top Count scintillation counter (Packard). Non-specific uptake of [14C]-glycine was determined in the presence of 10 mM unlabeled glycine. [' Cjtaurine uptake experiments were performed according to the same protocol except that 10 mM unlabeled taurine was used to determine non-specific uptake. To determine potencies, a range of concentrations of the compounds of the present invention was added to the cells, followed by the fixed concentration of [14C]glycine. The concentration of the present compound that inhibited half of the specific uptake of [14C]glycine (IC50 value) was determined from the assay data by non-linear curve fitting.<br>
In particular, the compounds of the following examples had activity in inhibiting specific uptake of [ 4C]glycine in the aforementioned assay, generally with an ICso value of less than about 10 micromolar. Preferred compounds within the present invention had activity in inhibiting specific uptake of [14C]glycine in the aforementioned assay with an IC^ value of less than about 1 micromolar. These compounds were selective for [I4C]glycine uptake (by GlyTl in the JAR cells) compared to [14C]taurine uptake (by the taurine transporter TauT in the JAR cells). Such a result is indicative of the<br>
intrinsic activity of the compounds in use as inhibitors of GlyTl transporter activity.<br>
The NMD A receptor is central to a wide range of CNS processes, and plays a role in a variety of disease states in humans or other species. The action of GlyTl transporters affects the local concentration of glycine around NMDA receptors. Selective GlyTl inhibitors slow the removal of glycine from the synapse, causing the level of synaptic glycine to rise. This in turn increases the occupancy of the glycine binding site on the NMDA receptor, which increases activation of the NMDA receptor following glutamate release from the presynaptic terminal. Because a certain amount of glycine is needed for the efficient functioning of NMDA receptors, any change to that local concentration can affect NMDA-mediated neurotransmission.

Several methods for preparing the compounds of this invention are<br>
illustrated in the following Schemes and Examples. Starting materials and the requisite intermediates are in some cases commercially available, or can be prepared according to literature procedures or as illustrated herein.<br>
The compounds of this invention may be prepared by employing reactions as shown in the following schemes, in addition to other standard manipulations that are known in the literature or exemplified in the experimental procedures. Substituent numbering as shown in the schemes does not necessarily correlate to that used in the claims and often, for clarity, a single substituent is shown attached to the compound where multiple substituents are allowed under the definitions hereinabove. Reactions used to generate the compounds of this invention are prepared by employing reactions as shown in the schemes and examples herein, in addition to other standard manipulations such as ester hydrolysis, cleavage of protecting groups, etc., as may be known in the literature or exemplified in the experimental procedures.<br>
In some cases the final product may be further modified, for example, by manipulation of substituents. These manipulations may include, but are not limited to, reduction, oxidation, alkylation, acylation, and hydrolysis reactions which are commonly known to those skilled in the art. In some cases the order of carrying out the foregoing reaction schemes may be varied to facilitate the reaction or to avoid unwanted reaction products. The following examples are provided so that the invention might be more fully understood. These examples are illustrative only and should not be construed as limiting the invention in any way.<br>
The present invention also provides a process for the preparation of a compound of the formula (I) which comprises the acylation of a compound of the formula (II) or (III):<br>

with an acylating agent X SO2R3 or Y CO(Am) R2 respectively, wherein p, R1 to R5, A and m are as hereinbefore defined and X and Y are displacable groups, and, thereafter, optionally converting one group R1 to R5 to another group R1 to R5 by methods known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Thus the compounds of formula III can be reacted with R2N=C=O, where R2 is as defined above, in the presence of a base such as Et.iN and a solvent such as DCM, or with R2COaH, again where R2 is as defined above, in the presence of HOBt, DCM and a base such as EtsN, or with R2OH or R2NH2, where R2 is as defined above, in the presence of a catalyst such as CDI.<br>
X and Y are conveniently halogen atoms such as chlorine. The acylation reaction is normally carried out in a non-polar solvent, for example a halogenated hydrocarbon such as dichloromethane in the presence of a base.<br>

As illustrated in general Reaction Scheme IV for the compounds of the<br>
present invention wherein R.4 is hydrogen and R.5 is hydrogen, a suitably substituted 4-cyanopiperidine is deprotonated employing base, such as KHMDS, followed by a nucleophilic substitution reaction, for example with 2-fluoropyridme, to provide 1-2. Exposure of this material to HC1 removes the Boc protecting goup to afford the free amine which is treated with a sulfonyl chloride under standard reaction conditions to provide the corresponding sulfonamide. Hydrogenation employing Ra-Ni under a hydrogen atmosphere provides the corresponding amine, which is acylated under standard reactions conditions to deliver the final material. In this instance, all of the sulfonyl chlorides, acid chlorides and carboxylic acids employed were commercially available or prepared by literature methods, as were the starting 4-cyanopiperidines. Reaction Scheme V<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
As illustrated in general Reaction Scheme V for the compounds wherein R4 is C1-6alkyl and R5 is hydrogen or C1-6 alkyl, a suitably substituted 4-cyanopiperidine is reacted with a sulfonyl chloride under standard reaction conditions to provide the corresponding sulfonamide. Nucleophilic addition to the nitrile using a Grignard reagent<br>
or double nucleophilic addition to the nitile using an alkyl cerium reagent furnishes the corresponding amine. After chromatographic resolution of the racemate, this material is acylated under standard conditions to deliver the final material. In this instance, all of the sulfonyl chlorides, acid chlorides, Grignard reagents, and alkyl lithium reagents, acid chlorides, and carboxylic acids were commercially available. The starting 4-cyanopiperidine is commercially available. Example 1<br>

2,4-dichIoro-N-{[3-(cyclopropylmethyl)-l-(lH-l,23-triazol-4-ylsulfonyl)azetidin-3-yl]methyl}benzamide: rert-butyI3-cyano-3-(cyclopropylmethyl)azetidine-l-carboxylate:<br>
To a solution of diisopropylamine (3.33g 4.64ml; 32.92mmol) in THF (60 ml) at 0°C was added n-butyllithium (2.5M in hexanes ; 13.17ml; 32.92 mmol). The solution was stirred for 30 minutes then cooled to -78°C. A solution of 3-cyanoazetidine-l-carboxylic acid terf-butyl ester (5g ; 27.43 mmol) in THF (40 ml) was added and the solution stirred for 1 hour. (Bromomethyl)cyclopropane (4.81 g 3.42 ml ; 35.67 mmol) was then added dropwise with stirring and the solution stirred for 30 minutes at -78°C, then allowed to warm to ambient temperature, and stirred for 3 hours. The reaction was cooled in an ice bath and quenched with saturated aqueous ammonium chloride. The solvent was evaporated and the residue was partitioned between EtOAc (300 ml) and water (100 ml). The organic phase was separated, dried over MgSO4, filtered and evaporated to give an orange oil. The crude product was passed through a silica gel plug eluted with 15% EtOAc DCM to give the product as a pale yellow oil. (5.25 g)<br>

Tert-butyl 3-(aminomethyl)-3-(cyclopropylmethyl)azetidine-l-carboxylate: To a solution of the previous product (2.2g ; 9.31 mmol) in ammonia in methanol (2.0M ; 20 ml) was added Raney Nickel (approx. 1 ml of 50% aqueous slurry) and the mixture agitated under an atmosphere of hydrogen (50 psi) on a Parr apparatus for 12 hours.<br><br>
LC/MS indicates consumption of starting material to give a new product peak of intended mass ion (m/e= 240). The catalyst was removed by filtration under nitrogen and washed with methanol (6x20 ml). The filtrate was evaporated to give a colourless oil which was used in the next step without further purification.<br>
tert-butyl 3-{2,4-dichlorobenzoyl}aminomethyl-3-(cyclopropylmethyl)-3-fluoropyridin-2-yl)azetidine-l-carboxylate:<br>
To a solution of the previous product (2.12g ; 8.82 mmol) and N-ethyldiisopropylamine (1.71 g 2.3 ml ; 13.23 mmol) in DCM (30 ml) at 0°C was added 2,4-dichlorobenzoyl chloride (2.21 g 1.48 ml ; 10.58 mmol) dropwise and the solution stirred for 4 hours, warming to ambient temperature. The reaction was quenched by the addition of water (5 ml) and volatile material evaporated. The residue was partitioned between EtOAc (100 ml) and water (50 ml). The aqueous phase was extracted with EtOAc (50 ml) and the combined organics dried over MgSO4, filtered and evaporated to give an orange oil. The crude product was chromatographed on silica gel eluted with 20% EtOAc in DCM to give the product as a colourless oil. (2.58g)<br>

LC/MS indicates consumption of starting material to give product of intended mass ion (m/e= 313:315 [3:2]). The solvent was evaporated and the residue partitioned between EtOAc (50 ml) and saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate (50 ml). The aqueous phase was extracted with EtOAc (2 x 50 ml) and the combined organics dried over MgSO4, filtered and evaporated to give a foamy white solid which was used without further purification. (1.95 g)<br>
2,4-dichloro-N-{[3-(cycIopropylmethyl)-l-(lH-l,2,3-triazol-4-yIsulfonyl)azetidin-3-yl]methyl}benzamide:<br>
To a stirred solution of the previous product (0.5g ; 1.59 mmol) in DCM (8 ml) at 0°C was added N-ethyldiisopropylamine (0.52 g ; 0.69ml; 3.99 mmol) followed by 1,2,3-triazole-4- sulfonyl chloride (0.45 g ; 2.23 mmol), and the solution allowed to stir at ambient temperature for 18 hours. LC/MS indicates a single product m/e= 444:446 (3:2). The<br>
reaction was diluted with DCM (10 ml) and water (2 ml) and  stirred vigorously for 10<br>
minutes. The mixture was poured through a 5µ. PTFE separation frit, the DCM layer was<br>
collected and the solvent evaporated under vacuum to give an oil. The crude product was<br>
chromatographed on silica gel eluted with 5% methanol in DCM to give the title<br>
compound as a foamy white solid which was recrystallised from methanol to give a white<br>
solid. (350 mg)<br>
