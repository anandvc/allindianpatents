(See Section 10 and Rule 13)<br>
COPOLYMERS AND DETERGENT COMPOSITIONS<br>
HINDUSTAN UNILEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under<br>
the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office<br>
at 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br>
COPOLYMERS AND DETERGENT COMPOSITIONS<br>
The present invention relates to copolymers which are used in laundry cleaning. The invention provides copolymers comprising  the monomers glycerol (meth)acrylate and poly(alkylene oxide) alkyl ether (meth)acrylate, a method for production and use of the copolymers, and detergent compositions comprising these copolymers.<br>
 Polymers are widely used in detergent compositions in order to improve the efficacy of the composition on the cleaning process. Their functionalities range from the use as surfactants, as builders, and to promote soil release and to prevent redeposition of the soil. Soil release polymers in general adhere to the fabric, thereby making subsequent staining easier to remove. Typically a fabric is washed in a solution containing a soil release polymer and then rinsed and dried as normal. If the fabric is then stained, the stain is more easily removed than if the fabric had not been pre washed in wash liquor containing the soil release polymer. Another common problem encountered when laundering fabrics is the deposition of particulates from the wash liquor (resultant either from particulate stains or present in the source water) onto unstained areas of fabric. This results in a general dulling of coloured fabrics or greying of white fabrics. The addition of anti-redeposition polymers alleviates this problem: anti-redeposition polymers keep soil in suspension during the wash, thereby stopping redeposition of the soil onto the fabric during the washing process.<br>
Sodium carboxy methyl cellulose (SCMC) is a typical example of an anti-redeposition polymer, and has been extensively used for decades already (see for example GB 1 354 498). A typical<br><br>
example of a soil release polymer is Sokalan EP22 ex BASF, which is a copolymer having a poly(ethylene oxide) backbone grafted with poly (vinyl acetate)  side croups, as for  example used in WO 97/34984. Another example of such a polymer is Repel-o-Tex SF2 (ex Rhodia).<br>
Also new polymers are being developed, in order; to improve stain removal during the washing process for example by improving the primary detergency effect, as well as to improve soil release and to prevent redeposition of the soil.<br>
EP 1 611 87 7 Al discloses a method for the impregnation of a drug into ophthalmic articles ir. order to prepare drug sustained release systems for the treatment of eye related disorders. The ophthalmic articles are preferably made from linear,, crosslinked, or branched polymers that axe selected from for example poly(acrylates), poly(glycerol methacrylates), poly(ethyleneglycol methacrylates), cellulose, and a long list of other polymers, none of them especially preferred-US 7,238,753 Bl discloses a stainproofing agent for carpet, wherein a stainproofing agent is exemplified that comprises polyethyleneglycolmethacrylate / glycerol methacrylate = 7 0/30 by weight ratio copolymer. This polymer is used in combination with other polymers.<br>
EP 040 8917A1 discloses a copolymer comprising an acrylate or methacrylate having a fluoroalkyl group and other groups that can impart durable water and oil repellency and soil releasability to fabrics.<br><br>
GB 12 83813 discloses hydrophilic polymers that are swellable hydrogels comprising at least two ethylenically 'unsaturated polymerisable momomers.<br>
A problem that still exists is to improve the detergency effect, especially the primary detergency effect of laundry detergent compositions on textile stains. This is especially required for, but not limited to particulate stains like gravel, clay and mud, and plant based stains like grass stains.<br><br>
Accordingly it is an object of the present invention to provide improved, detergent compositions that can improve the removal of soils and  stains during the cleaning process by enhancing- the primary detergency of the detergent composition. Additionally it is another object of the present invention to provide detergent compositions that improve soil release, and/or promote anti-redeposition of the soil,<br>
We have now found that one or more of these objects can be achieved by a water-soluble non-crosalinked copolymer comprising the monomers glycerol (meth.) aery late and poly{alkylene oxide) alkyl ether (meth)acrylate and less than 20wt% of another type of monomer. The incorporation of the polymers in laundry detergent compositions provides advantages like improved detergency of the surfactant system, especially in relation to primary detergency, and improved detergency with respect to different types of stains, for example particulate soil stains such as clay, gravel and mud. Moreover, the composition of the invention is particularly useful for removal of plant based stains like grass stains. The inclusion of the copolymer shows an improvement to the primary detergsney of a detersive surfactant system. In addition the copolymer of the invention may also exhibit soil release and/or anti-redeposition benefits in addition to this primary detergency benefit; however it is not required to exhibit these as such.<br>
Accordingly in a first aspect the present invention provides a water-soluble non-crosslinked copolymer comprising the monomers glycerol (meth)acrylate and poly(alkylene oxide)'alkyl ether [meth)acrylate, and Less than 20 wt% of'another type of monomer<br><br>
wherein the copolymer ha3 a number average molecular weight between 2,000 and 100,000 Dalton.<br>
In a second aspect the invention provides a method for production of the copolymer according to the first aspect of<br><br>
the invention by an addition polymerisation process, comprising the steps of;<br>
a)	forming an admixture of or comprising the monomers glycerol<br>
(meth)acrylate and poly(alkylene oxide) alkyl ether<br>
(meth)acrylate, and an initiator; and<br>
b)	reacting the mixture from a) to form a copolymer.<br>
In a third aspect the invention provides a laundry detergent composition comprising:<br>
a)	a detersive surfactant at a concentration between 3 and 85% by weight of the total composition;<br>
b)	a copolymer according to the first aspect of the invention at a concentration between 0.5 and 25% by weight of the total composition;<br>
c)	optionally other detergent ingredients up to 100% by  weight of the total composition.<br>
In a fourth aspect the invention	provides the use of a<br>
copolymer according to the first	aspect of the invention to<br>
provide improved detergency to a	laundry detergent composition<br>
comprising a surfactant.<br>
In a fifth aspect the invention provides the use of a copolymer according to the first aspect of the invention to provide improved soil release to a laundry detergent composition.<br>
In a sixth aspect the invention provides the use of a copolymer according to the first aspect of the invention to provide improved anti-redeposition to a laundry detergent composition.<br>
In a seventh aspect the invention provides a method for improving the stain removal from a textile substrate, comprising the following steps:<br><br>
a)	provision of a wash liquor comprising the laundry detergent composition according to the third aspect of the invention; and,<br>
b)	contacting one or more stained textile substrates with said wash liquor during one or more steps of a laundry process.<br>
Detailed description<br>
All percentages mentioned herein are by weight calculated on the total composition, unless specified otherwise. The abbreviation 'wt%' is to be understood as % by weight of the total composition.<br>
Primary detergency is herein described as the detergency effect on a stain in the primary or first wash. The fabric is stained and subsequently treated with the laundry detergent composition of the invention. The detergency effect (measured as stain removal) of the laundry composition on the stain is termed as primary detergency. This is a separate process to so-called soil release using a polymer, which is treatment of fabric with a polymer (through a wash or other such treatment), with subsequent staining of the fabric, the soil release polymer having the effect of the easier removal of the stain.<br>
The term '(meth)acrylate' embraces acrylate and methacrylate.<br>
In the context of the present invention, molecular weights of monomers and polymers are expressed as number average molecular weights (Mn), except where otherwise specified. The molecular weight of a polymer is typically a distribution of molecular weights, and is normally quoted as an average. Polymers are typically polydisperse and molecular weight averages can be defined in several ways. Determination of the number average molar mass Mn involves counting the total number of molecules,<br><br>
regardless of their shape or size, present in a unit mass of the polymer. Determination of the weight average molar mass Mw involves counting the weight fractions of molecules. A measure i of how polydisperse a polymer sample is quantitified by the ratio of Mw/Mn, which is the polydispersity index, PDi.<br>
The textile/fabric substrates used in the context of the present invention can be any typical textile/fabric substrate, such as cotton (woven, knitted &amp;  denim), polyester (woven, knitted &amp; microfibre), nylon, silk, polycotton<br>
(polyester/cotton blends), polyester elastine, cotton elastine, viscose rayon, acrylic or wool. Particularly suitable textile/fabric substrates are  cotton, polycotton and polyester substrates.<br>
The copolymer and monomers<br>
The copolymers according to the invention comprise the monomers glycerol (meth)aerylate and poly(alkylene oxide) alkyl ether (meth)acrylate. The copolymers consist or consist essentially of these two types of monomers, which means that the copolymer comprises less than 20 wt%, preferably less than 10 wt%, more preferably less than 5 wt% of another type of monomer.<br>
They are soluble, non-crosslinked addition polymers and include statistical, graft, gradient and alternating copolymers. Mostly preferred the copolymers comprise a backbone chain which is a linear backbone, meaning that the backbone is not branched or crosslinked- The copolymers could be regarded to be comb polymers, wherein the poly(alkylene oxide) alkyl ether side groups form the teeth of the comb, In another embodiment the copolymers according to the invention may also comprise block copolymers where for example the monomers are incorporated into<br><br>
the polymer as blocks of a single monomer, wherein a block may suitably consist of 4, or 5 or more single monomer molecules. In that case the copolymer will comprise discrete regions of the monomer glycerol (meth)acrylate or of the monomer poly (alkylene oxide) alkyl ether (meth)acrylate or discrete regions of both monomers.<br>
Glycerol' (meth)acrylate may exist in the form of the isomers 1-glycerol (meth)acrylate (also known as 2,3  dihydroxy propyl (meth)acrylate) or 2-glycerol (meth)acrylate (also known as 1,3 dihydroxy propyl (meth)acrylate). Glycerol (meth)acrylate is also known as glycerol mono(meth)acrylate. In the context of the present invention the use of the term 'glycerol (meth)acrylate' encompasses a mixture of the isomers 1-glycerol (meth)acrylate or 2-glycerol (meth)acrylate, unless indicated otherwise.<br>
The molecular structures of 1-glycerol methacrylate and 2-glycerol methacrylate are the following:<br><br>
1-glycerol   2-glycerol methacrylate methacrylate<br>
Glycerol (meth)acrylate is supplied for example by Evonik Industries (Essen, Germany).<br>
The other class of monomers incorporated in the copolymer according to the invention is poly(alkylene oxide) alkyl ether<br><br>
{meth)acrylate. This class of monomers is a hydrophilic monomer that is often used to introduce hydrophilic side chains into a (co)polymer.<br>
 The number average molecular weight of the copolymer according to the invention is between 2,000 and 100,000 Dalton. Preferred copolymers have a number average molecular weight of between 2,000 and 50,000 Dalton, more preferred between 5,000 and 50,000 Dalton, mostly preferred between 5,000 and 20,000<br>
  Dalton.<br>
The copolymer according to the invention comprises the monomer poly(alkylene oxide) alkyl ether (meth)acrylate. The alkylene oxide moiety may suitably be selected from the group consisting of ethylene oxide (EO), propylene oxide (PO), ethylene oxide -propylene oxide (both EO and PO moieties are incorporated), isopropylene oxide, butylene oxide, isobutylene oxide, and mixtures thereof. The alkyl group may suitably be a methyl or ethyl group.<br>
Preferably the copolymer according to the invention comprises the monomer poly(alkylene oxide) alkyl ether (meth)acrylate, wherein this monomer is selected from the group consisting of poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether (meth)acrylate, poly (ethylene glycol) ethyl ether (meth)acrylate, poly(propylene glycol) methyl ether (meth)acrylate, poly(propylene glycol) ethyl ether (meth)acrylate, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Mostly preferred the copolymer according to the invention comprises poly(alkylene oxide) alkyl ether (meth)acrylate monomer, wherein this monomer comprises poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether (meth)acrylate.<br><br>
The preferred average number of alkylene oxide groups in the poly(alkylene oxide) alkyl ether (meth)acrylate monomer ranges from 5 to  100, more preferred from 5 to  50,   mostly  preferred from 10 to 50. Preferably the copolymer according to the invention comprises a poly(alkylene oxide) alkyl ether (meth)acrylate monomer, wherein the number average molecular weight is between 300 and 5,000. Dalton. More preferably the number average molecular weight of the poly(alkylene oxide) alkyl ether (meth)acrylate monomer is between 300 and 3,000 Dalton, even more preferred between 1,000 and 3,000 Dalton, mostly preferred about 2,000 Dalton.<br>
As an example the molecular structure of the preferred monomer poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate is given here:<br><br>
Poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate, comprising n EO groups.<br>
When the number average molecular weight of this preferred monomer poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether (meth)acrylate is about 2,000 Dalton, the average number of EO groups in the ethylene oxide moiety is about 45.<br>
Preferably the molar ratio of the monomers poly(alkylene oxide) alkyl ether (meth)acrylate to glycerol (meth)acrylate that are comprised in the copolymer according to the invention ranges from 10:1 to l:10. More preferably the molar ratio between poly (alkylene cxiide) alkyl ether (meth) acrylate to glycerol (meth)acrylate ranges from 1:1 to 1:10, and even more<br><br>
preferably from 1:4 to 1:10, so that preferably on average more glycerol (meth)acrylate monomers than poly(alkylene oxide) alkyl ether (meth)acrylate monomers are comprised by the copolymer.<br>
Branched copolymers<br>
Although the copolymers according to the invention are preferably polymers that comprise a backbone chain which is a linear backbone, in another preferred embodiment are branched copolymers. Hence preferably the copolymer according to the invention is a branched copolymer comprising' at least two chains of monomers,<br>
wherein said chains comprise the monomer glycerol (meth)acrylate, or the monomer poly(alkylene oxide) alkyl ether (meth)acrylate, or  both monomers, and<br>
wherein the chains are covalently linked other than at their ends by a bridge formed by an ethyleneically polyunsaturated monomer.<br>
Branched polymers are polymer molecules of a finite size which are branched. Branched polymers differ from crosslinked polymer networks which tend towards an infinite size having interconnected molecules and which are generally not soluble but often swellable. These preferred copolymers according to the invention that are branched copolymers are soluble, branched, non-crosslinked addition polymers and include statistical, graft, gradient and alternating branched copolymers. The preferred copolymer  according  to  the invention that is a branched copolymer, is to be understood as a copolymer wherein a sample of said copolymer comprises on average at least two chains which are covalently linked by a bridge other than at their ends, and wherein said chains comprise the monomer glycerol (meth)acrylate, or the monomer<br><br>
poly(alkylene oxide) alkyl ether (meth)acrylate, or both monomers. When a sample of the polymer is made there might be accidentally some polymer molecules which are unbranched.<br>
The ethyleneically polyunsaturated monomer is also referred to as 'multifunctional monomer' or 'brancher'. Preferred multifunctional monomers include but are not limited to divinyl aryl monomers such as divinyl benzene; (meth) acrylate diesteirs such as ethylene glycol di(meth)acrylate, propyleneglycol di(meth)acrylate and 1,3-butylenedi(meth)acrylate;<br>
polyalkylene oxide di(meth)acrylates such as tetraethyleneglycol di(meth)acrylate, poly(ethyleneglycol) di(meth)acrylate and poly(propyleneglycol) di(meth)acrylate; divinyl (meth)acrylamides such as methylene bisacrylamide; silicone-containing divinyl esters or amides such as (meth)acryloxypropyl-terminated poly(dimethylsiloxane); divinyl ethers such as poly(ethyleneglycol)divinyl ether; and tetra- or tri-(meth)acrylate esters such as pentaerythritol tetra(meth)acrylate, trimethylolpropane tri(meth)acrylate or glucose di- to penta(meth)acrylate.<br>
Further examples include vinyl or allyl esters, amides or ethers of pre-formed oligomers or polymers formed via ring-opening polymerisation such as oligo (caprolactam), oligo(caprolactone), poly(caprolactam) or poly(caprolactone), or oligomers or polymers formed via a living polymerisation technigue such as oligo- or poly(1,4-butadiene).<br>
In case of the use of a preferred brancher divinyl benzene, a rather 'tight' branched polymer molecule can be obtained. When using a preferred brancher ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) a more stretched branched polymer can be obtained,<br><br>
depending on the length of the ethylene glycol moiety of the brancher monomer.<br>
As indicated in the paragraph before, macrocrosslinkers or   macrobranchers (multifunctional monomers having a molecular weight of at least 1000 Daltons) might also be used, and are generally formed by linking a polymerisable moiety, such as a vinyl or aryl group, to a pre-formed multifunctional polymer via a suitable linking unit such as an ester, an amide or an ether. Examples of suitable polymers are indicated above, but are not limited to these.<br>
Branchers include methylene bisacrylamide, glycerol di(meth)acrylate, glucose di- and tri(meth)acrylate, oligo(caprolactam) and oligo(caprolactone). Multi end-functionalised hydrophilic polymers may also be functionalised using a suitable polymerisable moiety such as a (meth)acrylate, (meth)acrylamide or styrenic group.<br>
Method for production of copolymers<br>
The present invention also provides a method for production of the copolymer according to the invention by an addition polymerisation process, comprising the steps of:<br>
a)	forming an admixture of or comprising the monomers glycerol<br>
(meth)acrylate and poly(alkylene oxide) alkyl ether<br>
(meth)acrylate, and an initiator; and<br>
b)	reacting the mixture from a) to form a copolymer.<br>
The polymers of the invention can be produced by any addition polymerisation process, preferably a free-radical chain polymerisation process. An addition polymerisation process is nowadays also called a radical chain addition polymerisation process.<br><br>
Polymers of the present invention can be prepared by any standard addition polymerisation process method utilized for the preparation of copolymers, which will result in a normal   polydispersity or molecular weight distribution, yielding statistical copolymers. However, it is preferred that the polymers of the invention are synthesized using a method that gives targeted, molecular weights of the polymer. An example of such a process is the controlled polymerisation technique atom transfer radical polymerisation (ATRP), so that polymers with targeted molecular weights and compositions can be obtained.<br>
Other methods that can be used for the production of the polymers according to the invention include anionic polymerisation, RAFT or Madix polymerisation (which may proceed via a macroinitiatox like the ATRP process) and Ce4+ redox initiated polymerisation.<br>
Atom  transfer radical polymerisation   technique When the ATRP technique would be used in the method for production of the polymer according to the invention, two reaction steps are involved:<br>
First  reaction   step<br>
In the first reaction step an initiator is produced and isolated, for example a macroinitiator. It will be apparent to the skilled person that other initiators may also be suitable for use in the ATRP process. A macroinitiator which would be suitable in the ATRP process for production of the copolymers of the present invention is a poly(alkylene glycol) macroinitiator, preferably a poly(ehtylene glycol) macroinitiator. This macroinitiator is produced by grafting a radical initiator onto a poly(alkylene glycol) via a<br><br>
nucleophilic displacement reaction between groups on the poly(alkylene glycol) and on the radical initiator, respectively. Typically the poly (alkylerte glycol) macroinitiator is formed by a nucleophilic displacement   reaction between:<br>
(i) a poly(alkylene glycol) which is end-capped with at least one group capable of nucleophilic attack via its 0, N or S atom, and<br>
(ii) a radical initiator comprising: at least one -C(0)X group, in which X is a leaving group capable of substitution by the nucleophilic 0, N or s atom of the end-capped poly(alkylene glycol) (i);<br>
and at least one organic halide group capable of generating a radical, preferably in the presence of a transition metal catalyst. The term halide means fluoride, chloride, bromide or iodide.<br>
The poly(alkylene glycol) (i) used to make the macroinitiator may be linear, branched or hyperbranched, provided it is end-capped with at least one group as described above. By 'end-capped' is meant that the capping group is at or near a terminal position of the poly(alkylene glycol). The poly(alkylene glycol) may be end-capped with suitable groups (e.g., hydroxyl) as a result of its synthesis or an additional reaction step may be required to end-cap the polymer chain.<br>
The radical initiator (ii) comprises at least one -C(0)X group, in which X is a leaving group capable of substitution by the nucleophilic 0, N or S atom of the poly(alkylene glycol) (i), and at least one organic halide group capable of generating a radical in the presence of a transition metal catalyst.<br><br>
Examples of preferred radical initiators have the formula: R14-C(0)X<br>
where R14 is the organic halide group and X is the leaving   group. Preferably, X is a halogen atom (i.e., F, Cl, Br or I). By 'organic halide group' is meant any linear, branched or cyclic (aromatic or otherwise) carbon structure, whether substituted or unsubstituted, which also contains a halogen atom (i.e., F, CI, Br or I).<br>
Preferred radical initiators have the general formula: C (R15) (R1S) Kal' - (R17) r -C (0) Hal<br>
where Hal' and Hal independently denote halogen atoms (as defined above) , R15 and R16 are independently selected from hydrogen or a monovalent, optionally substituted, linear or branched C1-18 hydrocarbon radical as described above, r is an integer having a value of 0 or 1, and R17 is selected from divalent, optionally substituted, linear or branched C1-C18 hydrocarbon radicals as described above.<br>
A particularly preferred radical initiator corresponding to the above general formula has:<br>
Hal and Hal' = Br, R15 and R16 = methyl and r = 0.<br>
The first reaction step involves a nucleophilic displacement reaction between (i) and (ii) at preferably ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure. The nucleophilic 0, N or S atom of the poly(alkylene glycol) (i) replaces leaving group X of radical initiator (ii), thereby linking (i) and (ii) to generate a poly(alkylene glycol) macroinitiator.<br><br>
Second reaction  step<br>
The second reaction step in the ATRP process that can be used<br>
to produce the copolymer according to the invention involves<br>
reacting the poly(alkylene glycol) macroinitiator obtained in<br>
step (i) with the radically polymerisable monomers glycerol<br>
(meth)acrylate and poly(alkylene oxide) alkyl ether<br>
(meth)acrylate in a solvent, in the presence of a catalytic or<br>
stoichiometric amount of a Cu (I) salt (catalyst) or other<br>
transitional metal species and a ligand. The ligand is present<br>
in order to produce copolymer molecules with a small variety in<br>
length, so that the polydispersity is small.<br>
The monomer concentration in this step can range from 20 wt% to 50 wt%, typically, depending on the viscosity of the reaction mixture. The reaction is carried out under a N2 atmosphere at ambient temperature, and the typical reaction duration is 1 to 4 hours, depending on the kinetics of a particular reaction composition and the conditions chosen. The solvent is for example a methanol/water mixture at a 3:1 ratio by volume. The choice of solvent(s) depends on the solubility characteristics of the monomers. Water may be added to the solution to speed up the kinetics and to enable the reaction to be carried out at ambient temperature. Preferably initiator to catalyst to ligand molar ratios of about 1:1:2 are applied in the ATRP technique.<br>
In the second reaction step, the organic halide groups act as initiators in the presence of the radically polymerisable monomers (glycerol (meth)acrylate and poly(alkylene oxide) alkyl ether (meth)acrylate) and the catalyst (Cu (I) salt), resulting in the linking of radically polymerisable monomers onto the poly(alkylene glycol) macroinitiator by atom transfer radical polymerisation.<br><br>
The catalyst for the second reaction step is a transition metal salt, preferably a Cu(I) salt such as a Cu(I) halide salt (i.e., wherein the halide is Cl, F, Br or I) and which is preferably complexed to a ligand which is suitable for solubilising the Cu(I) salt in the reaction mixture. WO 98/51261 describes preferred ligands for use in solubilising the Cu(I) salt in the reaction mixture {aprotic bidentates such as diphosphates, 2,2' bipyridyl, C1-C20 alkyl substituted bipyridyl and combinations thereof, most preferably 2,2' bipyridyl complexed to a Cu(I) halide salt, in particular CuCl). WO 98/51261 also refers to several journal articles which describe examples of the polymerisation process (atom transfer radical polymerisation) used in the second reaction step. Further examples of such descriptions can be found in Polymer  Vol 39, No.21, pp 5163-5170 (Nakagawa et al) and Macromolecules  1997, 30,   2190-2193 (Haddleton et al). Those skilled in the art would understand that a variety of other ligands can also be employed.<br>
The polymerisation process of the second reaction step can be furnished in bulk, solution, emulsion or suspension, as would be understood by those skilled in the art.<br>
In case the aim is to produce a block copolymer, a first monomer can be added to the reaction vessel in the second reaction step, prior to adding the second monomer, so that blocks of single monomers can be formed, prior to combining the blocks of single monomers  into copolymer molecules.<br>
If a brancher is used in order to produce branched copolymers, this brancher will present in the second reaction step with the other monomers glycerol (meth)acrylate and poly(alkylene oxide) alkyl ether (meth)acrylate.<br><br>
A chain   transfer agent  may be used in the preferred process, as is apparent to the skilled person. These agents may be an alcohol, preferably 2-propanol, or any thiol-containing molecule, and suitable thiols include but are not limited to C2-C18 alkyl thiols such as dodecane thiol, thioglycolic acid, thioglycerol, cysteine and cysteamine. If used, then the chain transfer agent is also present in the second reaction step<br>
The initiator  is a free-radical initiator and can be any molecule known to initiate free-radical polymerisation such as azo-containing molecules, persulfates, redox initiators, peroxides, benzyl ketones. These may be activated via thermal, photolytic or  chemical means. Examples of  these include but are not limited to 2,2'-azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN), azobis (4-cyanovaleric acid), benzoyl peroxide, cumylperoxide, 1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone, hydrogenperoxide/ascorbic acid. Initiators such as  benzyl-N,N-diethyldithiocarbainate can also be used.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
The invention will now be illustrated by the following non-limiting examples.<br>
Example 1: Preparation of copolymer comprising monomers poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate and glycerol methacrylate<br>
(A)   Preparation  of poly (ethylene glycol)    (PEG)   macroinitiator<br>
(PEG-1)<br>
Monomethoxypolyethylene glycol 350, ex Aldrich (35g, 0.1 mol) was dissolved in anhydrous toluene (300mL) in a 2-necked round bottom flask fitted with a suba seal and calcium chloride guard tube. Polymer bound 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine (PS-DMAP) (8g), triethylamine (TEA) (11.2g, 0.111 mol) and a magnetic stirrer bar were added to the reaction solution. 2-Bromoisobutyryl bromide (25.3g, 0.11 mol) was added dropwise via a syringe through the suba seal, which caused the initially clear solution to turn to a milky suspension.  After stirring at ambient overnight, the reaction solution was passed through a<br><br>
filter, and the toluene was removed using a rotary evaporator. The remaining brown liquid was dissolved in dichloromethane (200mL). This solution was added to a separating funnel and washed successively with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (l00mL), 1M hydrochloric acid (lOOmL) and brine (lOOmL). The dichloromethane layer was then dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and the solvent evaporated.  After drying overnight under vacuo  the product was obtained as a light brown oil (50.5g, 95% yield).<br><br>

(B)   Preparation  of copolymer of poly (ethylene  glycol)   methyl ether methacrylate   (PEGMA)   -  glycerol  monomethacrylate   (GMMA) A copolymer according to the invention was prepared using atom transfer radical polymerisation (ATRP) technique, so that polymers with targeted molecular weights and compositions can be obtained. Poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate solution (PEGMA,   Mn = 2080, 50 wt% in water) (ex Aldrich)<br><br>
(3.78g, 0.00091 mol), glycerol monomethacrylate (ex Evonik Industries) (GMMA,   1.46g, 0.0091 mol) and PEG-I (from step (A), 0.533g, 0.001 mol) were dissolved in methanol (5.32mL to give a final solvent composition of MeOH/water =2.8:1) in a 3-necked   50mL round bottom flask fitted with a magnetic stirrer bar, a nitrogen gas inlet and a suba seal fitted with a gas outlet. Dry nitrogen gas was bubbled through the solution for 45 minutes. Catalyst copper(I)bromide (0.143g, 0.001 mol) and ligand 2,2'-dipyridyl (0.3124g, 0.002 mol) were weighed into a glass vial, mixed and added to the reaction mixture by lifting the suba seal from the flask's socket and replacing the seal immediately after addition of the solids. The reaction mixture turned to a green colour on mixing the solids into solution, also an  increase in viscosity was noted. After mixing for 2 hours under a N2 blanket at ambient temperature, the solution was then poured through a bed of silica to remove the copper metal, which resulted in the initially dark green solution becoming clear and lightly brown coloured. After evaporation of the solvents and drying in  vacuo,   5 gram of off-white polymer was obtained, which is called polymer 1 in this example.<br><br>
where m, n and r are positive integers. 'CO' in the molecular formula of the polymer indicates that the polymer is a copolymer, that is that the resultant polymer is a statistical copolymer of the 2 monomers chosen in the reaction.<br><br>

Example 3: Measurement of the effect of the polymers on primary detergency<br>
Measurement  of Soil Release  Index   (SRI)<br>
SRI is a measure of how much of a stain on textile is removed during a washing process. The intensity of any stain can be measured by means of a reflectometer in terms of the difference between the stain and clean cloth giving ∆E* for each  stain. It is defined as ∆E*  and is calculated as:<br><br>
L*, a*, and b* are the coordinates of the CIE 1976 (L*,   a*, b*) colour space, determined using a standard reflectometer. AE* can be measured before and after the stain is washed, to give ∆E*bw  (before wash) and ∆E*aw   (after wash) . SRI is then defined as:<br><br>
A SRI of 100 means complete removal of a stain.<br>
Wash liquors were formulated, containing as surfactants primary alkyl sulfate (PAS anionic surfactant, average C12, EMAL PH10 ex Kao) and alcohol ethoxylate (nonionic surfactant average C12-C15-7EO, Neodol 25-7 ex Shell), as shown in table 2 at the indicated concentrations. Additionally the wash liquor contained other standard compounds of a laundry detergent (e.g. builder), as well as NaCl at a concentration of 5 mM. Water hardness was 6°FH.
