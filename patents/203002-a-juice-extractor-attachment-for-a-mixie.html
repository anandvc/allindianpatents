				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Field of invention: This invention relates to fruit and vegetable juice extractor attachment for mixer grinder for domestic use<br>
Background of invention:<br>
Mixier grinders known to the art are provided with jars having blade assemblies at the bottom. Such jars are used for various purposes such as for grinding, mixing, whipping food ingredients such as, fruits, vegetable Once grinding i.e. liquidized, it is normally necessary to separate the resulting juice from the pulp and this is conventionally done by means of a bowl shaped sieve or strainer. This process of separation of the juice from the pulp is tedious and time consuming. It can also be unhygienic if the juice comes into contact with the hands of the user while manually carrying out the sieving or straining operation.<br>
Summary:<br>
The juice extractor attachment for a mixie, according to this invention, comprises jar with a rotating blade assembly at its bottom; a cylindrical grinding chamber insertable into the jar, with the blades receivable in the bottom opening of the cylindrical grinding chamber, the outer surface of the wall of the cylindrical grinding chamber being spaced from the inner surface of the wall of the jar, a portion of the wall of the cylindrical grinding chamber being constituted into a mesh, characterized in that the cylinder grinding chamber with a upper opening for receiving ungrounded ingredient is provided with a detachable adapter that is positioned between the upper opening of cylindrical grinding chamber and a lid that covers the opening of the jar.<br>
This invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, that illustrate, by way of example, and not by way of limitation, one of its various possible embodiments.<br>
Fig. 1 illustrating an assembled view of the embodiment<br><br>
Fig. 2 illustrating a cutaway assembled view of the embodiment<br>
Fig. 3 illustrating the best view of the cylindrical grinding chamber of the said<br>
embodiment<br>
Fig. 4 illustrating the top view of the cylindrical grinding chamber of the said<br>
embodiment<br>
Fig. 5 illustrating a separate view of the adapter of the said embodiment<br>
Fig. 6 illustrating the cylindrical grinding chamber of the said embodiment<br>
Fig.  7 illustrating a separate view of the locking arrangement of the said<br>
embodiment<br>
Detailed description of invention<br>
Food ingredient from which juice is to be extracted is introduced into the cylindrical grinding chamber T and the mixier grinder is switched on. The rotating blades liquidize the ingredients; the juice passes through the mesh and enters the space between the cylindrical grinding chamber and the jar. After liquidizing, the juice is poured out from the jar, leaving the pulp in the cylindrical grinding chamber. The cylindrical grinding chamber is later removed, leaving the pulp in the jar.<br>
J the mixie jar with a powered blade assembly B at its bottom. A cylindrical grinding chamber T is insertable into the jar J with blades receivable in the bottom opening of the cylindrical grinding chamber.<br>
The outer surface W1 of the wall of the cylindrical grinding chamber is spaced from the inner surface W2 of the wall of the jar. A portion of the wall of the cylindrical grinding chamber is constituted into a mesh M.<br>
The Bottom of the cylindrical grinding chamber and the bottom of the jar have recess and protrusions respectively for locking and unlocking the cylindrical<br><br>
grinding chamber from the jar. One of the forms such means can take is a projection P on the inner wall of the jar J at its bottom and a tapering ledge L on the outer wall of the cylindrical grinding chamber T at its bottom. As the cylindrical grinding chamber T is fully inserted into the jar and rotated in one direction, the projection P rides over the ledge L and butts against a stop E provided on the ledge, thus arresting any further rotational movement of the cylindrical grinding chamber T inside the jar J. The cylindrical grinding chamber T is now locked with the jar. Unlocking of the cylindrical grinding chamber involves the reverse procedure.<br>
The locking of the jar with respect to the cylindrical grinding chamber maintains the cylindrical grinding chamber T stable in position during the juice extracting operation.<br>
The adapter S is provided for closing the top opening of the cylindrical grinding chamber.<br>
According to another embodiment, the adapter is made to enter the top opening of the cylindrical grinding chamber, however in this form the interior of the cylindrical grinding chamber and the exterior of the adapter are stepped at H1 and H2, the step on the adapter being seatable on the step on the cylindrical grinding chamber.<br>
In both forms, the purpose of the adapter S is to close the top opening of the cylindrical grinding chamber.<br>
A lid F closes the mouth of the Jar J. In the closed position of the lid F, it sustains adapter S, for tightly closing the top opening.<br><br>
One of the forms the adapter can take is a cup so that the adapter when not in use can be used as a measuring vessel (with reference graduations marked on its sides) and so as a drinking cup.<br>
The top end of the cylindrical grinding chamber has extended lip at K and provided with at least two recesses R opposite each other. These recesses serve as finger grips for inserting the cylinder into and removing it from the jar.<br>
An advantage of this invention is that the cylindrical grinding chamber, after inserted into the jar, is quickly and easily locked or unlocked to the jar and when locked, the cylindrical grinding chamber is held in stable position within the jar.<br>
Another advantage for this invention is that top end of the cylindrical grinding chamber is closed by an adapter which prevents the juice from spilling out of the said chamber. Furthermore, the material inside the cylindrical grinding chamber, during liquidizing, is continuously thrown upwards to come into contact with adapter and then thrown downwards, to mix well during the liquidizing operation.<br>
A further advantage of this invention is that the top end of the cylindrical grinding chamber has extended lip and recessed to provide a good manual grip.<br>
The invention proposed herein is well suited for the extraction of juices, coconut milk, tamarind juices; butter churning, preparation of lassi, egg whipping. Ease in use, ease in pouring and ease in cleaning are noteworthy of this invention. Complete extraction is made possible.<br>
From the foregoing description it will be observed that various other embodiments of the juice extractor attachment for a mixie are possible without departing from the scope and ambit of this invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1.	Juice extractor for mixer grinder comprises a jar supporting a powered grinding blade assembly receivable by a cylindrical grinding chamber insertable and clamped into the jar characterized in that the cylinder grinding chamber with a upper opening for receiving ungrounded ingredient is provided with a detachable adapter that is positioned between the upper opening of cylindrical grinding chamber and a lid that covers the opening of the jar.<br>
2.	Juice extractor as claimed in claim 1, wherein the upper end of the cylindrical chamber extended lip is provided with recess on either side.<br>
3.	Juice extractor as claimed in claim 1 and claim 2, wherein the adaptor is sustained by the flared extension of the cylindrical grinding chamber such that the ungrounded pulp of the ingredient during grinding operation is pushed back to the blade assembly.<br>
4.	Juice extractor as claimed in claim 1, wherein a portion of the cylindrical grinding chamber is provided with mesh to simultaneously filter the juice that is grinded within the cylindrical grinding chamber.<br>
5.	Juice extractor as claimed in claim 1, wherein the cylindrical grinding chamber insertable into the jar is attached or detached from the Jar based on predetermined rotation of the cylindrical grinding chamber such that recess in the chamber interlocks with the protrusions provided along the inner of the jar.<br><br>
6. Juice extractor as claimed in claim 1, wherein the adapter is cylindrical structured with reference graduations along the sidewalls and is tightly positioned between the cylindrical grinding chamber and the lid of the jar.<br><br></td>
