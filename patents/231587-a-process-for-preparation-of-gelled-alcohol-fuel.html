				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a process for preparation of gelled alcohol fuel composition.<br>
PRIOR.ART<br>
Gelled fuels can be used as portable and safe fuel and are ideal for barbecues, fireplnces, bench fires and can bo utilised at very high altitudes in extreme cold conditions. Gelled fuels are non-explosive and safe for use as a domestic fuel. These fuels can be easily packaged and transported in tin containers, squeeze tubes and large refill plastic containers and are extremely useful for mountaineers and troops stationed at high altitudes.<br>
Majority of these gelled fuels, comprise derivatives of cellulose such as methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose hydroxy ethyl/propyl cellulose, nitrocellulose in conjunction with other ingredients. A number of organic polymeric gellants are also known in the prior art.<br>
Gelation of alcohol with various gellants is also known to the prior art. Majority of these incorporate derivatives of cellulose such as methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, hydroxy ethyl/propyl cellulose, nitrocellulose in conjunction with other ingredients. A number of organic polymeric gellants are also known to the prior art. However, the processes of preparation of gelled alcohol fuel compositions, known in the prior art, suffer from following disadvantages.<br>
Primary disadvantage of the processes for the preparation of gelled alcohol fuel composition, known in the prior art, is that these processes utilise costly vinyl copolymers.<br>
Another disadvantage of the processes, known in the prior art, for the preparation of gelled alcohol fuel composition is that these processes utilise amine processing aids.<br>
Yet anotherdisadvantage of the processes- known in the prior art, for preparation of gelled alcohol fuel composition is that these known processes do not result in a gelled fuel composition having gel stability at  high ambient temperatures (40-50 째C).<br>
Still further disadvantage of the processes known in the prior art, for preparation of gelled alcohol fuel composition is that these known processes result in a fuel composition which is noisy and smoky while burning.<br><br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided a process for preparation of gelled alcohol fuel composition comprising the steps of:-<br>
(i)        preparation of sol by mixing methyl cellulose as herein<br>
described to water;<br>
(ii)       mixing of plasticiser to the sol to obtain plasticised sol; (iii)      addition of ethanol to the plasticised sol; (iv)      addition of cross-linker to the plasticised sol prepared<br>
in step (iii); (v)       stabilisation of the gelled fuel composition.<br>
(i)        Preparation  of sol  by  mixing  methyl  cellulose  with water:<br>
A sol comprising a colloidal dispersion is prepared by adding in installments 2-3% preferably (weight/wise) methyl cellulose containing about 30% methoxy content to water at 65-70째C and stirring the mix for about 30-40 min. The water taken is preferably 15-18% by weight of the composition.<br>
(ii)   Mixing of plasticiser to the sol to obtain plasticised sol<br>
A water soluble plasticizer such as 1,3-butanediol preferably around 15% by weight is added in installments over 10 minutes to make the mix thick and flexible while the temperature drops to around 65째C. The stirring is continued for 30 minutes.<br>
(iii)   Addition of ethanol to the plasticised sol<br>
65-70% (weight wise) preferably 65% of ethanol (95%) is added to the plasticized sol in portions and the mix is allowed to cool down. Gel formation takes place during this process .<br>
(iv)   Addition of  cross linking Agent to the plasticised sol prepared in step (iii)<br>
During this step, very small quantity (less than 0.1% and preferably .05% by weight of the fuel composition) of a crosslinker is added to the gel, under continuous stirring, to make it stable. This is followed by addition of alcohol.The<br>
crosslinker may be glyoxal or preferably an inorganic one like zirconium oxy-chloride (minimum zirconium content 36%}. The alcohol is taken in preferred quantity of 2-3% wt.  it wise.<br>
(v)       Stabilisation of gelled fuel composition :<br>
The entire composition is left undisturbed for several hours. During this process, zirconium oxychloride induced cross-linking of the gel takes place resulting in the formation of cohesive structural gel.<br>
The process of the present invention will now be illustrated with a working example' which is intended to be typical examples to illustrate the working of the invention and is not intended to be taken restrictively to imply any limitation on the scope of the invention.<br>
WORKING EXAMPLE:<br>
For preparation of lOOg. of the gelled alcohol fuel composition, ISgmof water is heated up to 70 째C. The heating is stopped and about 2.3 gm methyl cellulose (containing about 30 % methoxy content) is added in installments over a period of 30 minute under continuous stirring until swelling occurs. To this warm mixture, 15 gm 1,3 butanediol is added in installments in 10 minute to make the mix thick. Stirring is continued for 30 minutes and 65 gm ethanol (rectified spirit 95 %) is added in installments Care is taken to ensure that each installment of alcohol is completely dispersed. Once the temperature of the mix drops down to 40 째C, 0:05% gm Zirconium oxi-chloride (minimum zirconium content 36%) is then added followed by addition of 2.65 gm of alcohol. Stirring is continued for half an hour and then the entire content is transferred to the container with closed fitting lid and is allowed to set overnight. During the entire operation the stirrer speed is maintained at 3 00-400 rpm.<br>
PROPERTIES OF GEL FUEL:<br>
Properties of the gel fuel, prepared in the above manner, is as following:<br>
