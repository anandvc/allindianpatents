Process of Reducing Ilmenite<br>
Description<br>
This invention relates to a process of reducing ilmenite<br>
which has a titanium dioxide content of 45 to 65 wt-% and a<br>
content of iron oxides of 30 to 50 wt-%. The reduced ilmenite<br>
can then be further processed to obtain for instance syn-<br>
thetic rutile with a TiO2 content of more than 90 wt-%.<br>
The reduction of ilmenite and also the further processing to<br>
obtain synthetic rutile are known from GB 23 15 742 A. For<br>
reduction purposes, a plurality of stationary fluidized beds<br>
are employed. In the US-Patent 5,403,379 it is described to<br>
perform the reduction of the ilmenite in a rotary tube.<br>
It is the object underlying the invention to perform the re-<br>
duction of the ilmenite in a manner suitable for commercial<br>
plants and to operate as inexpensively as possible. In accor-<br>
dance with the invention this is achieved in that in a first<br>
fluidized-bed reactor the ilmenite is partly reduced to a de-<br>
gree of metallization of 50 to 90 %, based on the iron ox-<br>
ides, and in a second reactor, which contains at least one<br>
stationary fluidized bed, the ilmenite is reduced to a metal-<br><br>
lization of 85 to 98 %, based on the iron oxides, where re-<br>
ducing fluidizing gas with temperatures in the range from 600<br>
to 1000°C and a (H2 + CO ) content of 80 to 100 vol-% is sup-<br>
plied to both reactors, that from the upper portion of the<br>
first fluidized-bed reactor solids are supplied to a separa-<br>
tor with a gas stream, in which separator solids are at least<br>
partly separated from the gas stream, and separated solids<br>
are at least partly recirculated to the first fluidized-bed<br>
reactor, where the amount of solids recirculated every hour<br>
to the first fluidized-bed reactor is about five to twentyfive<br>
times the amount of solids contained on average in the first<br>
fluidized-bed reactor, and that exhaust gas from the second<br>
reactor is introduced into the first reactor. The pressure in<br>
the two reactors usually is 1 to 10 bar.<br>
The circulation of solids connected with the first fluidized-<br>
bed reactor via the reactor to the separator and back to the<br>
reactor provides for high reaction rates and at the same time<br>
long dwell times of the solids in the reactor. The coupling<br>
with the second reactor leads to a high degree of metalliza-<br>
tion while at the same time optimally utilizing the fluidiz-<br>
ing gas. Expediently, the exhaust gas withdrawn from the<br>
first fluidized-bed reactor is at least partly reused as flu-<br>
idizing gas after processing the same (e.g. dedusting and, if<br>
necessary, removal of CO2).<br>
When the crude ilmenite has a relatively high content of FeO,<br>
an oxidative pretreatment prior to the reduction may become<br>
necessary, as the FeO is present with a crystal lattice<br>
structure which largely resists the attack of the reducing<br>
gas. Only the conversion of FeO to Fe2O3 with the related<br>
conversion of the crystal lattice facilitates the subsequent<br>
reduction. Expediently, the ilmenite is heated in an oxida-<br>
tion stage by combustion with air in a circulating fluidized<br>
bed to temperatures in the range from 600 to 1000°C, before<br>
it is charged into the first reactor. From the fluidized bed<br><br>
of the oxidation stage an exhaust gas with an O2 content of 3<br>
to 10 vol-% and mostly 4 to 8 vol-% is withdrawn. The O2 con-<br>
tent of the exhaust gas reveals that the fluidized bed of the<br>
oxidation stage provides favorable conditions for the oxida-<br>
tion of FeO to obtain Fe2O3. Usually it is ensured that the<br>
ilmenite withdrawn from the oxidation stage contains not more<br>
than 5 wt-% and preferably not more than 3 wt-% FeO.<br>
An advantageous embodiment of the second reactor consists in<br>
that it has 2 to 6 chambers disposed one beside the other,<br>
where each chamber contains a stationary fluidized bed. The<br>
solids are moving one after the other through all chambers in<br>
which iron oxides are reduced. In this way, high solid dwell<br>
times and a good utilization of the reducing gas are also<br>
achieved in the second reactor.<br>
One embodiment of the process consists in that coal and car-<br>
bon monoxide obtained therefrom are employed as reducing<br>
agents, and fluidizing gases chiefly consisting of CO are<br>
supplied to the first and the second reactor. In a gasifier,<br>
granular coal is partially oxidized with O2-containing gas,<br>
and a mixture containing hot gases and char with temperatures<br>
of 900 to 1200°C is introduced from the gasifier into the<br>
first reactor. In the first reactor there is thus obtained a<br>
temperature of preferably at least 900°C. Exhaust gas con-<br>
taining CO is withdrawn from the first reactor, dedusted and<br>
largely liberated from CO2, before it is recirculated to the<br>
two reactors as fluidizing gas.<br>
Embodiments of the process will be explained with reference<br>
to the drawing, wherein:<br>
Fig. 1 represents a flow diagram of the process using coal<br>
as a source for the reducing agent, and<br><br>
Fig. 2 represents a further flow diagram of the process,<br>
where hydrogen is used as main reducing agent.<br>
In accordance with Fig. 1, the reduction of the ilmenite is<br>
effected in the first fluidized-bed reactor 1 and then in the<br>
second fluidized-bed reactor 2. The crude, granular ilmenite<br>
is supplied via line 4 and for preheating purposes charged<br>
into a Venturi heat exchanger 5, to which hot exhaust gases<br>
are supplied through line 6. In direct contact with the hot<br>
gases, the ilmenite is carried to the top and supplied<br>
through line 7 to a cyclone 8. At this point, gases and sol-<br>
ids are separated, where the hot exhaust gas is supplied<br>
through line 9 first of all to a waste heat boiler 10 and<br>
then through a dry dedusting 11 and a wet dedusting 12. Via<br>
lines 14 and 40, cooled and dedusted exhaust gas flows to a<br>
washing column 41 for removing CO2. Part of the gas is re-<br>
moved from the process through line 42. Washing to largely<br>
remove the CO2 is effected in a known manner with a washing<br>
solution, which upon usage is reprocessed in the regenerator<br>
43 and then recirculated. Heating steam is supplied to the<br>
regenerator 43 through line 44, CO2 escapes via line 45. The<br>
gas, which chiefly consists of CO and H2, is supplied by<br>
means of the blower 48 as a cold gas in a partial stream<br>
through line 28 to the cooling portion of the reactor 2. The<br>
remaining gas flows in the branch line 49 to the fired heater<br>
23 and from there is further utilized as hot fluidizing gas.<br>
Preheated ilmenite comes from the cyclone 8 and through line<br>
15 is first of all delivered to a gasifier 16, and through a<br>
passage 17 carrying hot solids and gases it is introduced<br>
into the fluidized-bed reactor 1. In contrast to the drawing,<br>
preheating may also be effected in several stages.<br>
 Through line 18, granular coal is charged into the gasifier<br>
16, where the grain size of the coal lies in the range from<br>
0.3 to 8 mm. At the same time, O2-containing gas (in particu-<br><br>
lar air or air enriched with O2) is supplied through line 19,<br>
in order to partially oxidize the coal in the gasifier 16. In<br>
order to promote the fluidization of solids in the gasifier,<br>
fluidizing gas is additionally supplied through line 20. This<br>
fluidizing gas comes from the fired heater 23, flows through<br>
line 24, and through the branch lines 25, 26, and 27 enters<br>
the first and the second reactor 1, 2 as fluidizing gas. The<br>
gas in line 24 has temperatures in the range from 600 to<br>
1000°C and preferably 700 to 900°C, its content of CO + H2<br>
lies in the range from 80 to 100 vol-%, and it has a residual<br>
CO2 content of not more than 5 vol-%, preferably not more<br>
than 3 vol-%.<br>
Due to the partial oxidation of coal, the gasifier 16 pro-<br>
duces char and hot gases, which chiefly contain CO and have<br>
temperatures in the range from 900 to 1200°C, when they enter<br>
the reactor 1 and carry along the preheated ilmenite from<br>
line 15. In the fluidized-bed reactor 1 the temperatures lie<br>
in the range from 700 to 1100°C, and usually 900 to 1050°C.<br>
From the upper portion of the reactor 1 large amounts of<br>
gases and solids are constantly passed through the passage 29<br>
and supplied to a separator 30, e.g. a cyclone. The hot ex-<br>
haust gases escape via line 6 and, as has already been de-<br>
scribed, serve to preheat the ilmenite. The separated solids,<br>
which include ilmenite and above all char, are delivered via<br>
line 31 to the upper portion of the gasifier 16 and from<br>
there are recirculated to the reactor 1 through the passage<br>
17. The amount of solids flowing through line 31 per hour is<br>
five to twenty five times the amount of solids contained on aver-<br>
age in the reactor 1.<br>
From the reactor 1, treated ilmenite and char are continu-<br>
ously withdrawn through line 33, where the ilmenite has a de-<br>
gree of metallization of 50 to 85 %, based on the iron ox-<br>
ides. The mixture of solids is delivered to the second flu-<br>
idized-bed reactor 2, which in the present case has two cham-<br><br>
bers 2a and 2b used for reduction and subsequently two cham-<br>
bers 2c and 2d used for cooling. The chambers are separated<br>
from each other by weirs 35, across which the solids migrate<br>
from one chamber to the next, starting with the first chamber<br>
2a up to the fourth chamber 2d. In each chamber, the solids<br>
form a stationary fluidized bed, to which fluidizing gas is<br>
supplied through lines 25 and 26 as well as through lines 28<br>
and 28a. The exhaust gas from the second reactor 2 is intro-<br>
duced through line 34 into the first reactor 1. In the first<br>
two chambers 2a and 2b the temperatures lie in the range from<br>
600 to 1000°C and preferably 700 to 900°C, the other two<br>
chambers 2c and 2d are provided with an indirect cooling 37.<br>
Cooled, reduced ilmenite together with char is withdrawn via<br>
line 38, and it can then for instance be supplied to a fur-<br>
ther treatment and processing to obtain synthetic rutile. For<br>
this further treatment it is expedient to sulfidize certain<br>
metal components, e.g. manganese, in the reactor 2. For this<br>
purpose, the second chamber 2b has a feeding lance 39 for<br>
liquid sulfur, which is sprayed into the solids mixture.<br>
There is chiefly formed manganese sulfide, which during the<br>
further treatment can easily be separated outside the proc-<br>
ess.<br>
When the crude ilmenite has a relatively high content of FeO,<br>
it is necessary to first of all pass it through an oxidation<br>
stage, so as to largely convert FeO to Fe2O3. This oxidation<br>
stage will subsequently be explained with reference to Fig.<br>
2. The ilmenite from the oxidation stage has temperatures of<br>
600 to 1000°C, so that the preheating represented in Fig. 1<br>
by means of the units with the reference numerals 5 to 8 can<br>
be omitted. In this case, the hot, oxidized ilmenite is in-<br>
troduced through line 4a indicated in Fig. l in broken lines<br>
into the gasifier 16, from where it is introduced into the<br>
reactor 1. The hot exhaust gas of line 6 will now directly be<br>
supplied through line 6a to the waste heat boiler 10.<br><br>
The process illustrated in Fig. 2 includes an oxidation<br>
stage, whose main portion is a circulating fluidized bed com-<br>
prising the fluidized combustion chamber 50, a connecting<br>
passage 51, a cyclone 52 and a return line 53. Fuel, e.g.<br>
natural gas, is supplied to the fluidized combustion chamber<br>
50 through line 54, and combustion air, which is also used<br>
for fluidization, comes from line 55. As has already been de-<br>
scribed in conjunction with Fig. 1, the crude ilmenite is de-<br>
livered through line 4 into the Venturi heat exchanger 5, to<br>
which hot gases coming from the cyclone 52 are also supplied<br>
through line 56. The gas-solids mixture is delivered through<br>
line 7 into the cyclone 8, where the gases flow off through<br>
line 8a. The heated ilmenite leaves the cyclone 8 through<br>
line 15 and is introduced into the lower portion of the flu-<br>
idized combustion chamber 50. In the chamber 50, there are<br>
provided oxidizing conditions and temperatures in the range<br>
from 600 to 1000°C, and through line 56 an exhaust gas is<br>
withdrawn, which has an O2 content of 3 to 10 vol-% and usu-<br>
ally 4 to 8 vol-%.<br>
The oxidized and heated ilmenite, which is supplied to the<br>
first fluidized-bed reactor 1 via line 4a, has an FeO content<br>
of not more than 5 wt-% and preferably not more than 3 wt-%.<br>
Through line 27, fluidizing gas rich in hydrogen is supplied<br>
to the reactor 1, which fluidizing gas comes from a fired<br>
heater 23a, has a temperature in the range from 600 to 1000°C<br>
and consists of H2 for at least 90 vol-%. The reduction of<br>
the ilmenite is basically effected in the same way as ex-<br>
plained above in conjunction with Fig. 1. The explanations<br>
relating to Fig. 2 can therefore be made short and in part be<br>
replaced by using the same reference numerals as in Fig. 1.<br>
Hot gases and solids are separated in the cyclone 30, and the<br>
solids are recirculated to the reactor 1 through line 31. A<br>
small amount of fluidizing gas is constantly supplied to a<br>
syphon 31a through line 31b.<br><br>
The partly reduced ilmenite is introduced through line 33<br>
into the second reactor 2, which now has three chambers 2a,<br>
2b and 2c used for reduction. To the last chamber 2c, liquid<br>
sulfur is supplied through the lance 39. Fluidizing gas comes<br>
from the fired heater 23b and is distributed through line 26<br>
and int roduced into the chambers of the reactor 2. The re—<br>
duced ilmenite is introduced through line 57 into a separate<br>
cooler 58, which has a means 59 for indirect cooling, and to<br>
which hydrogen is supplied as fluidizing gas through line 60.<br>
This hydrogen freshly supplied to the process can be produced<br>
in a plant known per se, which is not represented here.<br>
The hydrogen flowing off the cooler via line 60a is admixed<br>
to the exhaust gas of line 61, which has previously been<br>
withdrawn from the cyclone 30 through line 62 and cooled in<br>
the heat exchanger 10. A dry dedusting 11 and a wet de-<br>
dusting 12 are provided subsequently. Part of the exhaust gas<br>
is withdrawn through line 42 and removed from the process,<br>
the remaining exhaust gas is passed for a first heating from<br>
the blower 48 first through the heat exchanger 10 and then<br>
through line 49 into the two fired heaters 23a and 23b, be-<br>
fore it is reused in the reactors 1 and 2. Cooled, reduced<br>
ilmenite is available in line 38 for further usage.<br>
Example 1<br>
There is employed the procedure illustrated in Fig. 1<br>
(without lines 4a and 6a), where the following amounts of<br>
solids are supplied to the plant:<br>
Through line 4: 44.3 t/h ilmenite with 49 wt-% TiO2/<br>
48.6wt-% iron oxides, and<br>
0.1 wt-% moisture;<br>
through line 18: 7566 kg/h coal with 77.3 wt-% C,<br>
4 wt-% ash, 8 wt-% moisture and a lower<br>
calorific value of 31000 kJ/kg;<br><br>
through line 39: 350 kg/h liquid sulfur.<br>
Partly reduced ilmenite with a temperature of 1050°C and a<br>
metallization of 85 %, based on the iron oxides, is intro-<br>
duced into the second reactor 2 through line 33; the solids<br>
additionally contain a considerable amount of char. The aver-<br>
age dwell time of the solids in the first reactor 1 is 15<br>
minutes, because every hour 20 times the amount of solids,<br>
based on the average amount of solids in the reactor, is re-<br>
circulated to the reactor 1 through line 31 and the passage<br>
17. From the second reactor 2 a solids mixture is withdrawn<br>
through line 38 in a total amount of 42 t/h, from which 3 t/h<br>
char are separated by screening. The reduced ilmenite con-<br>
sists of 56 wt-% TiO2, 36.5 wt-% metallic Fe, 1.6 wt-% FeO<br>
and the rest gangue (in particular Al2O3 and CaO) .<br>
The following gases are flowing in the process in accordance<br>
with Fig. 1:<br>
Through line 19: 4344 Nm3/h -technically pure oxygen;<br><br>
through line 20: 3000 Nm3 /h fluidizing gas of 750°C;<br>
through line 27: 12000 Nm3 /h fluidizing gas of 750°C;<br>
through lines 25 and 26: 7000 Nm3 /h fluidizing gas of 750°C;<br><br>
through line 28: 5600 Nm3 /h fluidizing gas of 60°C;<br>
the components of the fluidizing gas are<br>
indicated in Table 1, column A.<br>
Through line 9 there are flowing 44000 Nm3/h exhaust gas with<br>
a temperature of 560°C and consisting of the components indi-<br>
cated in Table 1, column B. The exhaust gas in line 14 has<br>
been cooled to 35°C, the partial stream withdrawn via line 42<br><br>
in an amount of 5900 Nm3 /h is used in part as fuel for the<br>
fired heater 23 and in part for generating steam.<br>
Through line 44, 15 t/h steam are supplied to the regenera-<br><br>
tion column 43, and 5600 Nm3 /h CO2 are withdrawn through line<br>
45. The gas-solids mixture in the passage 17 has a tempera-<br>
ture of 1085°C, 13500 Nm3/h gas and 302 t/h solids including<br>
70 wt-% carbon and 15 wt-% FeO • TiO2 flow through the pas-<br>
sage. 12660 Nm3/h gas with a temperature of 650°C flow<br>
through line 34, the composition is indicated in Table 1,<br>
column C.<br><br>
Example 2<br>
The procedure is as illustrated in Fig. 2, where 54.2 t/h il-<br>
menite are supplied to the oxidation stage through line 4.<br>
The composition of said ilmenite is indicated in Table 2,<br>
column A:<br><br><br>
The oxidized solids, which are charged into the first reactor<br>
1 through line 4a in an amount of 54.5 t/h and with a tem-<br>
perature of 900°C, have the composition indicated in Table 2,<br>
column B. The partly reduced ilmenite, which is charged into<br>
the second reactor 2 through line 33 with a temperature of<br>
800°C and in an amount of 48.4 t/h, has a metallization of<br>
65%, based on the iron oxides, and the composition indi-<br>
cated in column C of Table 2. The composition of the cooled<br>
product, which is withdrawn with a temperature of 80°C via<br>
line 38, is indicated in column D of Table 2. The amount of<br>
solids recirculated every hour via line 31 is 15 times the<br>
amount of solids contained on average in the first reactor 1.<br>
The gas quantities are as follows:<br>
Through line 54: 1005 Nm3/h natural gas and 1000 Nm3/h<br>
exhaust gas from line 42;<br>
through line 55: 37200 Nm3/h air;<br>
through line 8a: 38500 Nm3 /h exhaust gas with 10 vol-% O2;<br>
through line 27: 45500 Nm3 /h fluidizing gas with a<br>
temperature of 1000°C and the composition<br>
indicated in Table 1, column D;<br><br>

Abstract<br><br>
The ilmenite to be reduced has a titanium dioxide content of 45<br>
to 65 wt-% and a content of iron oxides of 30 to 50 wt-%. In a<br>
first fluidized-bed reactor the ilmenite is partly reduced to a<br>
degree of metallization of 50 to 90 %, based on the iron<br>
oxides, and in a second reactor, which contains at least one<br>
stationary fluidized bed, the ilmenite is reduced to a<br>
metallization of 85 to 98 %, based on the iron oxides. Reducing<br>
fluidizing gas with temperatures in the range from 600 to<br>
1000°C and a (H2 + CO) content of 80 to 100 vol-% is supplied<br>
to both reactors. From the upper portion of the first<br>
fluidized-bed reactor solids are supplied to a separator<br>
together with a gas stream, and in said separator solids are at<br>
least partly separated from the gas stream, and separated<br>
solids are at least partly recirculated to the first fluidized-<br>
bed reactor. The amount of solids recirculated every hour to<br>
the first fluidized-bed reactor is 5 to 25 times the amount of<br>
solids contained on average in the first fluidized-bed reactor.<br>
Exhaust gas from the second reactor is introduced into the<br>
first reactor.</td>
