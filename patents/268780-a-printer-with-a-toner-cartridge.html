				<td>BACKGROUND<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates generally to information handling systems, and more particularly to a toner agitator for a printer that may be connected to an information handling system.<br>
[0002] As the value and use of information continues to increase, individuals and businesses seek additional ways to process and store information. One option is an information handling system (IHS). An IMS generally processes, compiles, stores, and/or communicates information or data for business, personal, or other purposes. Because technology and information handling needs and requirements may vary between different applications, IHSs may also vary regarding what information is handled, how the information is handled, how much information is processed, stored, or communicated, and how quickly and efficiently the information may be processed, stored, or communicated. The variations in IHSs allow for IHSs to be general or configured for a specific user or specific use such as financial transaction processing, airline reservations, enterprise data storage, or global communications. In addition, IHSs may include a variety of hardware and software components that may be configured to process, store, and communicate information and may include one or more computer systems, data storage systems, and networking systems.<br>
[0003] It is often desirable to couple a printer to an IHS in order to print documents, images, and a variety of other printed matter known in the art. Some printers such as, for example, laser printers, include toner cartridges that hold the toner used to create the printed matter. Sometimes, the performance of the printer may suffer due to, for example, uneven flow of the toner inside the toner cartridge that may prevent the toner from being provided to the printer to allow printing. As a result, the toner cartridge may be discarded before the toner has been used up.<br>
[0004] One solution used to achieve the full yield of the toner in the toner cartridge is to remove the toner cartridge from the printer and shake it. This solution is undesirable due to the need for human intervention, the subjective nature of such intervention, and the risk of toner spillage during the intervention. In addition, many users are unaware or uncomfortable with performing such a solution and instead replace the toner cartridge, resulting in a waste of available toner.<br>
[0005] Another solution to this problem is to provide a mechanism that is internal to the toner cartridge to agitate the toner. However, this may require a relatively large toner cartridge and, due to the clearance required for the flow of the toner within the toner cartridge as well as the coagulation tendencies of toner, substantial toner may be remain within the toner cartridge even after operation of the mechanism. As such, it may still be required that the toner cartridge be removed from the printer and shaken in order to achieve the full yield of the toner in the toner cartridge, resulting in the problems mentioned above.<br>
[0006]     Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide an improved toner agitator for a printer.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0007] According to one embodiment, a printer includes a toner cartridge coupling section; a toner agitation member located adjacent the toner cartridge coupling section, wherein the toner agitation member is operable to engage a surface of a toner cartridge when the toner cartridge is located in the toner cartridge coupling section; and an actuator that is operable to actuate the toner agitation member.<br>

A toner housing 202g is defined between the top wall 202a, the bottom wall 202b, the front wall 202c, the rear wall 202d, and the pair of opposing side walls 202e and 202f. A toner directing member 204 is located in the toner housing 202g adjacent the front wall 202c and the bottom wall 202b, and a toner outlet 206 is defined by the front wall 202c adjacent the toner directing member 204. In an embodiment, the toner directing member 204 and the toner outlet 206<br>
includes structures and/or devices (not shown) for delivering toner for printing.   A pivotal coupling 208 is located on the bottom wall 202b adjacent the front wall 202c.<br>
[0026] Referring now to Figs. 3a and 3b, a partial internal view of a printer 300 is illustrated. In an embodiment, the printer 300 may be coupled to, for example, the IMS 100, described above with reference to Fig. 1. In an embodiment, the printer 300 may include elements of the IHS 100 such as, for example, the processor 102, the input device 106, the storage 108, the display 110, the video controller 112, and/or the memory 114. In an embodiment, the printer 300 may be, for example, a laser printer. In an embodiment, the printer 300 may include a variety of conventional printer systems known in the art in addition to the system described below. In an embodiment, the portion of the printer 300 illustrated in Fig. 3 is located internally in a printer housing and includes an actuator 301 that, in an embodiment, includes a motor 302 that is coupled to a gear 304 by a shaft 306. In an embodiment, the actuator 301 may be used to actuate another device in the printer 300 other than the toner agitation system described below such as, for example, a paper path gear and/or other motor driven devices in the printer 300. A clutch mechanism 308 is located adjacent the gear 304. A clutch plate 310 is located adjacent the clutch mechanism 308 and includes a shaft 312 that extends from the clutch plate 310. In an embodiment, the clutch mechanism 308 is moveable relative to the gear 304 and the clutch plate 310 such that it may be in engagement with both the gear 304 and the clutch plate 310 at the same time. A toner agitation member 314 is coupled to the shaft 312. In the illustrated embodiment, the toner agitation member 314 is an eccentric cam that includes a disc that is coupled to the shaft 312 at a location on the disc that is not the center of rotation of the disc and, as such, rotation of the shaft 312 will rotate the disc such that a surface that is in constant engagement with a surface on the disc during its rotation will experience a constant and repetitively reversing linear motion. In an embodiment, the eccentric cam may be fabricated with a particular diameter, coupled to the shaft 312 at a location on the cam to produce a particular eccentricity, and rotated at a speed to provide an amplitude and frequency of vibration transmitted to a toner cartridge (described in further detail below) that achieves optimal agitation of toner in the toner cartridge 200. A toner cartridge coupling section 316 is located adjacent the toner agitation member 314 and includes a cleaner member 318 and a biasing member 320 that is resiliency biased towards the toner agitation member 314 by at least one resilient member 320a. In an embodiment, the cleaner member 318 includes a base 318a having a bottom wall 318b, a top wall 318c located opposite the bottom wall 318b, a front wall 318d extending between the bottom wall 318b and the top wall 318c, and a pair of opposing<br>
side walls 318e and 318f extending between the bottom wall 318b, the top wall 318c, and the front wall 318d. A residual toner housing 318g is defined by the base 318a between the bottom wall 318b, the top wall 318c, the front wall 318d, and the side walls 318e and 318f. A drum 322 is partially located in the residual toner housing 318g and a toner removal member 324 extends from the top wall 318c to a location adjacent the drum 322. A cartridge coupling member 326 that defines a toner entrance 326a is coupled to the base 318a of the cleaner member 318 by a flexible material 328 that extends between the base 318a and the cartridge coupling member 326. In an embodiment, the cartridge coupling member 326 is moveably coupled to the cleaner member 318 and/or a portion of the toner cartridge coupling section 316. In an embodiment, the cartridge coupling member 326 includes features (not shown) to secure a toner cartridge to the cartridge coupling member 326. A pivotal coupling 330 is located adjacent the cleaner member 318 and the drum 320. A paper passageway 332 is located adjacent the drum 322.<br>
[0027] Referring now to Figs. 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, 4a, 4b, 4c and 4d, a method 400 to agitate toner in a toner cartridge is illustrated. The method 400 begins at block 402 where the toner cartridge 200 is provided. The toner cartridge 200 includes toner, not illustrated, in the toner housing 202g. The method 400 then proceeds to block 404 where the toner cartridge 200 is coupled to the printer 300. The toner cartridge 200 is positioned in the toner cartridge coupling section 316 of the printer 300 such that the toner cartridge 200 engages the cartridge coupling member 326 to secure the toner cartridge 200 to the printer 300, and the pivotal coupling 208 on the toner cartridge 200 engages the pivotal coupling 330 on the toner cartridge coupling section 316 to provide a moveable, pivotal coupling of the toner cartridge 200 to the printer 300. In an embodiment, with the toner cartridge 200 secured to the cartridge coupling member 326, the toner outlet 206 on the toner cartridge 200 is aligned with the toner entrance 326a on the cartridge coupling member 326 in order to allow the delivering of toner in the toner cartridge 200 to the drum 322. In an embodiment, with the toner cartridge 200 secured to the cartridge coupling member 326, the bottom wall 202b of the toner cartridge 200 engages the biasing member 320, and the top wall 202a of the toner cartridge 200 engages the toner agitation member 314, as illustrated in Fig. 4b. In an embodiment, the engagement of the bottom wall 202b of the toner cartridge 200 with the biasing member 320 biases the toner cartridge 200 towards the toner agitation member 314. The method 400 then proceeds to block 406 where toner in the toner cartridge 200 is agitated. The clutch mechanism 308 may be moved in a direction A, using methods known in the art, to engage the gear 304 and the clutch plate 310. Activation of the motor 302 rotates the shaft 306 and turns the gear 304. Due to the<br>
engagement of the clutch mechanism 308 and the gear 304, the turning of the gear 304 turns the clutch mechanism 308. Due to the frictional engagement of the clutch mechanism 308 and the clutch plate 310, the turning of the clutch mechanism 308 rotates the clutch plate 310, the shaft 312, and the toner agitation member 314. Rotation of the toner agitation member 314 causes the toner cartridge 200 to move back and forth along a direction B, illustrated in Figs. 4c and 4d, due to the engagement of the toner agitation member 314 with a surface on the top wall 202a of the toner cartridge 200. The movement of the toner cartridge 200 results in any toner located in the toner housing 202g being directed towards the toner outlet 206. Use of the toner in the toner cartridge 200 to print may result in an uneven flow and distribution of toner in the toner housing 202g and available toner may be unable to reach the toner outlet 206. By agitating the toner, as described above, the toner is moved towards the toner outlet 206 such that it may be used to print. In an embodiment, the agitation of the toner may be manually initiated by a user or automatically enabled by, for example, the processor 102 on the IMS 100, described above with reference to Fig. 1, that is coupled to the printer 300 or a processor located in the printer 300 itself. In an embodiment, a printer controller (not shown) coupled to the printer 300 may be triggered to invoke a specific service routine to agitate the toner cartridge 200. For example, an optical density sensor may detect when toner is running low and then initiate the agitation of the toner, or toner agitation may be performed at .certain time intervals or after the printer has been used to print. With the toner directed towards the toner outlet 206, the toner directing member 204 may be used to direct the toner out of the toner outlet 206 and through the toner entrance 326a to the drum 322. The drum 322 may then be used to deliver toner to paper that is moved adjacent to the drum 322 in the paper passageway 332.<br>
[0028] Referring now to Figs. 2a, 2b, 5a and 5b, in an embodiment, a printer 500 is substantially similar in structure and operation to the printer 300, described above with reference to Figs. 3a and 3b, with the provision of a plurality of toner agitation members 314 located on the shaft 312 in a spaced apart relationship from each other, and a plurality of toner cartridge coupling sections 316 located adjacent each other in a spaced apart relationship such that each toner cartridge coupling section 316 is adjacent a corresponding toner agitation member 314 and each toner cartridge coupling section 316 is rotated approximately 90 degrees from the orientation illustrated in Fig. 3a, as illustrated in Fig. 5a. In operation, a toner cartridge 200 may be secured to each toner cartridge coupling section 316 of the printer 500 in substantially the same manner as described above for the printer 300, and the toner in each of<br><br>
the toner cartridges 200 may be agitated in substantially the same manner as described above for the printer 300, illustrated in Fig. 5b.<br>

In operation, a toner cartridge 200 may be secured to the toner cartridge coupling section 316 of the printer 600 in substantially the same manner as described above for the printer 300. The toner in the toner cartridge 200 may be agitated substantially similarly as described above for the printer 300, with the provision of the plurality of toner agitation members 314 engaging a surface of the top wall 202a of the toner cartridge 200 in order to move the toner cartridge 200 relative to the printer 600.<br>
[0030] Referring now to Figs. 7a and 7b, in an embodiment, a toner cartridge 700 is substantially similar in structure and operation to the toner cartridge 200, described above with reference to Figs. 2a and 2b, with the provision of a biasing member 702 coupled to the bottom wall 202b of the toner cartridge 200 by a resilient member 704, as illustrated in Fig. 7a. In operation, the toner cartridge 700 may be secured to a toner cartridge coupling section that is substantially similar to the toner cartridge coupling section 316, described above with reference to Figs. 3a and 3b, with the provision of a biasing member securing device 706. With the toner cartridge 700 secured to the toner cartridge coupling section, the resilient member 704 may bias the toner cartridge 700 towards the toner agitation member 314, as illustrated in Fig. 7b. Thus, a system and method are provided that agitate toner in a toner cartridge without the need for user intervention.<br>
