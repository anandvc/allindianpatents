FIELD OF TEE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel human insulin derivatives which are soluble and have a protracted profile of  action, to a method of providing such derivatives, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them, and to the use of such insulin derivatives in the treatment of diabetes.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Many diabetic patients are treated with multiple daily insulin  injections in a regimen comprising one or two daily injections  of a protracted insulin to cover the basal  reguirement<br>
supplemented by bolus injections of a rapid acting insulin to<br>
cover the reguirement related to meals.<br>
Protracted insulin compositions are well Known in the art.  Thus, one main type of protracted insulin compositions  comprises injectable aqueous suspensions of insulin crystals or<br>
amorphous insulin. In these compositions, the insulin compounds<br>
utilized typically are protamine insulin, zinc insulin or<br>
protamine zinc insulin.<br><br>
 Certain drawbacks are associated with the use of insulin suspensions. Thus, in order to secure an accurate dosing, the insulin particles must be suspended homogeneously by gentle shaking before a defined volume of the suspension is withdrawn from a vial or expelled from a cartridge. Also, for the storage  of insulin suspensions, the temperature must be kept within  more narrow limits than for insulin solutions in order to avoid lump formation or coagulation.<br>
While it was earlier believed that protamines were non-<br>
immunogenic, it has now turned out that protamines can be<br>
 immunogenic in man and that their use for medical purposes may<br><br><br>
lead to formation of antibodies (Samuel et al., Studies on the immunogenecity of protamines in humans and experimental animals by means of a micro-complement fixation test, Clin. Exp. Immunol. 11, pp. 252-260 (1978)).<br>
Also, evidence has been found that the protamine-insulin complex is itself immunogenic (Kurtz et al., Circulating IgG antibody to protamine in patients treated with protamine-insulins. Diabetologica 25., pp. 322-324 (1983)). Therefore, with some patients the use of protracted insulin compositions containing protamines must be avoided.<br>
Another type of protracted insulin compositions are solutions having a pH value below physiological pH from which the insulin will precipitate because of the rise in the pH value when the solution is injected. A drawback with these solutions is that the particle size distribution of the precipitate formed in the tissue on injection, and thus the timing of the medication, depends on the blood flow at the injection site and other parameters in a somewhat unpredictable manner. A further irawback is that the solid particles of the insulin may act as a local irritant causing inflammation of the tissue at the site of  injection.<br>
Wo 91/12817 (Novo Nordisk A/S) discloses protracted, soluble insulin compositions comprising insulin complexes of zobalt(III). The protraction of these complexes is only intermediate and the bioavailability is reduced.<br>
Human insulin has three primary amino groups; the N-terminal group of the A-chain and of the B-chain and the e-amino group of LysB29. Several insulin derivatives which are substituted in one or more of these groups are known in the prior art. Thus, JS Patent No. 3,528,960 (Eli Lilly) relates to N-carboxyaroyl insulins in which one, two or three primary amino groups of the insulin molecule has a carboxyaroyl group. No specifically NB29-substituted insulins are disclosed.<br><br>
According to GB Patent No. 1,492.997 (Nat. Res. Dev. Corp.), it has been found that insulin with a carbamyl substitution at N*'^ has an improved profile of hypoglycaemic effect.<br>
JP laid-open patent application No. 1-254699 (Kodama Co., Ltd.)  discloses insulin wherein a fatty acid is bound to the amino group of Phe^' or to the e-amino group of Lys^^ or to both of these. The stated purpose of the derivatisation is to obtain a pharmacologically acceptable, stable insulin preparation.<br>
Insulins, which in the B30 position have an amino acid having<br>
(1 at least five carbon atoms which cannot necessarily be coded<br>
 for by a triplet of nucleotides, are described in JP laid-open<br>
patent application No.  57-067548  (Shionogi).  The insulin<br>
analogues are claimed to be useful in the treatment of diabetes<br>
mellitus, particularly in patients who are insulin resistant<br>
 due to generation of bovine or swine insulin antibodies.<br>
By "insulin derivative" as used herein is meant a compound having a molecular structure similar to that of human insulin including the disulfide bridges between CysA7 and CysA7 and between CysA20 and CysB19 and an internal disulfide bridge between  cysA6 and CysA11, and which have insulin activity.<br>
However, there still is a need for protracted injectable insulin compositions which are solutions and contain insulins which stay in solution after injection and possess minimal inflammatory and immunogenic properties.<br>
 One object of the present invention is to provide human insulin derivatives, with a protracted profile of action, which are soluble at physiological pH values.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a pharmaceutical  composition  comprising  the  human  insulin  derivatives according to the invention.<br><br><br>
It is a further object of the invention to provide a method of making the human insulin derivatives of the invention.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Teminology<br>
The three letter codes and one letter codes for the amino acid  residues used herein are those stated in J. Biol. chem. 243. p.<br>
 3558 (1968).<br>
In the DNA seguences, A is adenine, C is cytosine, G is guanine, and T is thymine. The following acronyms are used:  DMSO for dimethyl sulphoxide, DMF for dimethylformamide, Boc for tert-butoxycarbonyl, RP-HPLC for reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography, X-OSu is an N-hydroxysuccinimid ester, X is an acyl group, and TFA for trifluoroacetic acid.<br>
 Preparation of lipophilic insulin derivatives<br>
The insulin derivatives according to the present invention can be prepared i.a. as described in the following:<br>
1. Insulin derivatives featuring in position B30 an amino acid residue which can be coded for by the genetic code. e.g.  threonine (human insulin) or alanine (porcine insulin).<br><br>
1.1	starting from human insulin.<br>
Human insulin is treated with a Boc-reagent (e.g. di-tfirt-butyl<br>
dicarbonate) to form (A1,B1)-diBoc human insulin, i.e., human<br>
insulin in which the N-terminal end of both chains are<br>
protected by a Boc-group. After an optional purification, e.g.<br>
 by HPLC, an acyl group is introduced in the c-amino group of LysB29 by allowing the product to react with a N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of the formula X-OSu wherein X is the acyl group to be introduced. In the final step, TFA is used to<br>
 remove the Hoc-groups and the product^ NB29-X human insulin, is<br>
 isolated.<br>
1.2	starting from a single chain insulin precursor.<br>
A single chain insulin precursor, extended in position Bl with an extension (Ext) which is connected to Bl via an arginine<br>
 residue and in which the bridge from B30 to Al is an arginine residue, i.e. a compound of the general formula Ext-Arg-B(1-30)-Arg-A(l-21) , can be used as starting material. Acylation of this starting material with a N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of the general formula X-OSu wherein X is an acyl group, introduces<br>
 the acyl group X in the e-amino group of Lys^" and in the N-terminal amino group of the precursor. On treating this acylated precursor of the formula (NB29-X),X-Ext-Arg-B(l-30)-Arg-A(l-21) with trypsin in a mixture of water and a suitable water-miscible organic solvent, e.g. DMF, DMSO or a lower<br>
 alcohol, an intermediate of the formula (NB29-X),ArgB31 insulin<br>
 is obtained. Treating this intermediate with carboxypeptidase B yields the desired product, (NB29-X) insulin.<br>
2. Insulin derivatives with no amino acid residue in position B30. i.e. des(B30^ insulins.<br>
30 2.1 starting from human insulin or porcine insulin.<br><br>
On treatment with carboxypeptidase A in anunonium buffer, human<br>
insulin and porcine insulin both yield des(B30) insulin. After<br>
an optional purification, the des(B30) insulin is treated with<br>
a Boc-reagent (e.g. di-tert-butyl dicarbonate) to form (Al,Bl)-<br>
rdiBoc des(B30) insulin, i.e., des(B30) insulin in which the N-<br>
 terminal end of both chains are protected by a Boc-group. After<br>
an optional purification, e.g. by HPLC, an acyl group is<br>
introduced in the e-amino group of LysB29 by allowing the product<br>
to react with a N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of the formula X-OSu<br>
 wherein X is the acyl group to be introduced. In the final<br>
 step, TFA is used to remove the Boc-groups and the product,<br>
(NB29-X) des(B30) insulin, is isolated.<br>
2.2 Starting from a single chain human insulin precursor.<br>
A single chain human insulin precursor, which is extended in<br>
 position Bl with an extension (Ext) which is connected to Bl<br>
 via an arginine residue and which has a bridge from B30 to Al<br>
can be a useful starting material. Preferably, the bridge is a<br>
peptide of the formula Y^-Arg, where Y is a codable amino acid<br>
except lysine and arginine, and n is zero or an integer between<br>
  1 and 35. When n&gt;l, the Y's may designate different amino<br>
 acids. Preferred examples of the bridge from B3 0 to Al are:<br>
AlaAlaArg, SerArg, serAspAspAlaArg and Arg (European Patent No.<br>
163529). Treatment of such a precursor of the general formula<br>
Ext-Arg-B( 1-30)-Y„-Arg-A( 1-21) with a lysyl endopeptidase, e.g.<br>
 ActroTnobacter lyticus protease, yields Ext-Arg-B(l-29) Thr-Y„-<br>
Arg-A(l-21) des(B30) insulin. Acylation of this intermediate<br>
with a N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of the general formula X-OSu<br>
wherein X is an acyl group, introduces the acyl group X in the<br>
 e-amino group of LysB29, and in the N-terminal amino group of the<br>
chain and the B-chain to give (NB29-X) X-Ext-Arg-B(l-29) X-<br>
Thr-Y^-Arg-A(l-21)  des(B30)  insulin.  This  intermediate on<br>
treatment with trypsin in mixture of water and a suitable<br>
organic solvent, e.g. DMF, DMSO or a lower alcohol, gives the<br>
desired derivative, CNB29-X) des(B30) human insulin.<br><br>
Data on MB29 Kodified insulins.<br>
Certain experimental data on NB29 modified insulins are given in Table 1.<br>
The lipophilicity of an insulin derivative relative to human<br>
 insulin, krel, was measured on a LiChrosorb RP18 (um, 250x4 man)<br>
HPLC column by isocratic elution at 40"C using mixtures of A)<br>
0.1 M  sodium phosphate buffer,  pH 7.3,  containing  10%<br>
acetonitrile, and B) 50% acetonitrile in water as eluents. The<br>
elution was monitored by following the UV absorption of the<br>
  eluate at 214 nm. Void time, tg, was found by injecting 0.1 mM<br>
 sodium nitrate. Retention time for human insul in, t^^^f^, was<br>
adjusted to at least 2to by varying the ratio between the A and<br>
B solutions. <br>
The degree of prolongation of the blood glucose lowering effect<br>
  was studied in rabbits. Each insulin derivative was tested by<br>
 subcutaneous injection of 12 nmol thereof in each of six<br>
rabbits in the single day retardation test. Blood sampling for<br>
glucose analysis was performed before injection and at 1, 2, 4<br>
and 6 hours after injection. The glucose values found are<br>
of expressed  as  percent  of  initial  values.  The  Index  of<br>
Protraction, which was calculated from the blood glucose<br>
values, is the scaled Index of Protraction (prolongation), see<br>
p. 211 in Markussen et al.. Protein Engineering 1 (1987) 205-<br>
213. The formula has been scaled to render a value of 100 with<br>
 bovine ultralente insulin and a value of 0 with Actrapid*<br>
 insulin (Novo Nordisk A/S, 2880 Bagsvaerd, Denmark).<br>
The insulin derivatives listed in Table 1 were administered in solutions containing 3 Zn2+ per insulin hexamer, except those specifically indicated to be Zn-free.<br>
 For the very protracted analogues the rabbit model is inadequate because the decrease in blood glucose from initial is too small to estimate the index of protraction. The prolongation of such analogues is better characterized by the<br><br>
disappearance rate in pigs. T50% is the time when 50% of the A14 Tyr(125I) analogue has disappeared from the site of injection as measured with an external Tf-counter (Ribel, U et al.. The Pig as a Model for Subcutaneous Absorption in Man. In:<br>
 M.  serrano-Rios and P.J.  Lefebre  (Eds):  Diabetes 1985;<br>
 Proceedings of the l2th Congress of the International Diabetes Federation, Madrid, Spain, 1985 (Excerpta Medica, Amsterdam,<br>
(1986) 891-96).<br>
In Table 2 are given the T50% values of a series of very  protracted insulin analogues. The analogues were administered in solutions containing 3 Zn2+ per insulin hexamer.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
solubility<br>
The solubility of all the NB29 modified insulins mentioned in Table 1, which contain 3 Zn2+ ions per insulin hexamer, exceeds 600 nmol/ml in a neutral (pH 7.5), aqueous, pharmaceutical formulation which further comprises 0.3% phenol as preservative, and 1.6% glycerol to achieve isotonicity. 600 nmol/ml is the concentration of human insulin found in the 100 lU/ml compositions usually employed in the clinic.<br>
The e-B29 amino group can be a component of an amide bond, a sulphonamide bond, a carbamide, a thiocarbamide, or a carbamate. The lipophilic substituent carried by the C-B29 amino group can also be an alkyl group.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions containing a human insulin derivative according to the present invention may be administered parenterally to patients in need of such a treatment. Parenteral administration may be performed by subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous injection by means of a syringe, optionally a pen-like syringe. Alternatively, parenteral administration can be performed by means of an infusion pump. A further option is a composition which may be a powder or a liquid for the administration of the human insulin derivative in the form of a nasal spray.<br>
The injectable human insulin compositions of the invention can be prepared using the conventional techniques of the pharmaceutical industry which involves dissolving and mixing the ingredients as appropriate to give the desired end product.<br>
Thus, according to one procedure, the human insulin derivative is dissolved in an amount of water which is somewhat less than the final volume of the composition to be prepared. An isotonic agent, a preservative and a buffer is added as required and the pH value of the solution is adjusted - if necessary - using an acid, e.g. hydrochloric acid, or a base, e.g. aqueous sodium hydroxide as needed- Finally, the volume of the solution is<br><br><br>
adjusted with water to give the desired concentration of the ingredients.<br>
Examples of isotonic agents are sodium chloride, mannitol and glycerol.<br>
Examples of preservatives are phenol, m-cresol, methyl p- hydroxybenzoate and benzyl alcohol.<br>
Examples of suitable buffers are sodium acetate and sodium phosphate.<br>
 composition for nasal administration of an insulin derivative  according to the present invention may,  for example, be prepared as described in European Patent No. 272097 (to Novo Nordisk A/S).<br>
The insulin compositions of this invention can be used in the<br>
treatment of diabetes. The optimal dose level for any patient<br>
 will depend on a variety of factors including the efficacy of<br>
 the specific human insulin derivative employed, the age, body<br>
weight, physical activity, and diet of the patient, on a<br>
possible combination with other drugs, and on the severity of<br>
the case of diabetes. It is recommended that the daily dosage<br>
 of the human insulin derivative of this invention be determined<br>
 for each individual patient by those skilled in the art in a<br>
similar way as for known insulin compositions.<br>
Where  expedient,  the human  insulin derivatives  of this<br>
invention may be used in mixture with other types of insulin,<br>
 e.g. human insulin or porcine insulin or insulin analogues with<br>
 a more rapid onset of action.  Examples of such insulin<br>
analogues  are  described  e.g.  in  the  European  patent<br>
applications having the publication Nos. EP 214826 (Novo<br>
 Nordisk A/S), EP 375437 (Novo Nordisk A/S) and EP 383472 (Eli<br>
 Lilly &amp; Co,).<br><br>
The present invention is further illustrated by the following examples which, however, are not to be construed as limiting the scope of protection. The features disclosed in the foregoing description and in the following examples may, both  separately and in any combination thereof, be material for realizing the invention in diverse forms thereof.<br>

Phol, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1984). 5 g of human insulin was dissolved in 500 ml of water while the pH value of the solution was kept at 2.6 by addition of 0.5 M sulphuric acid. Subsequently, the  insulin was salted out by addition of 100 g of ammonium  sulphate and the precipitate was isolated by centrifugation. The pellet was dissolved in 800 ml of 0.1 M ammonium hydrogen carbonate and the pH value of the solution was adjusted to 8.4 with 1 H ammonia.<br>
 50 mg of bovine carboxypeptidase A was suspended in 25 ml of water and isolated by centrifugation. The crystals were suspended in 25 ml of water and 1 M ammonia was added until a clear solution was obtained at a final pH of 10. The carboxypeptidase solution was added to the insulin solution and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 24 hours. A few drops  of toluene were added to act as preservative during the reaction.<br>
After 24 hours the des(B30) human insulin was crystallized by successive addition of 80 g of sodium chloride while the  solution was stirred. The pH value was then adjusted to 8.3 and the crystallization was allowed to proceed for 20 hours with gentle stirring. The crystals were isolated on a 1.2 ^m filter, washed with 250 ml of ice cold 2-propanol and finally dried in vacuum.<br>

  (MiniLeak is a divinylsulfone activated Sepharose CL 6B,<br>
obtained from KemEnTec, Copenhagen) . The gel was kept in<br>
suspension by gentle stirring for 24 hours at room temperature.<br>
Then, the gel was isolated by filtration, washed with water,<br>
and suspended in 20 ml of 1 M ethanolamine buffer, pH 9.4, and<br>
 kept in suspension for 24 hours at room temperature. Finally,<br>
 the gel was washed with water followed by 0.1 M acetic acid and<br>
