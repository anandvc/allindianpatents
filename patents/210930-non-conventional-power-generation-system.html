ASHOK PURSHOTTAM  LACHKE,<br>
'Amar Villa', Lane No.13,<br>
Prof Kale Path,<br>
Sir Bhandarkar Road,<br>
PUNE-411004. Maharashtra State, India An Indian National<br>
The following specification describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
Granted<br><br><br><br>
5 JUL 2004<br><br><br>
generated which can be utilised as a resource for the power generation, which will benefit mankind.<br>
On national and state highways, a number of light, heavy and medium vehicles continuously plying on the road. Due to friction of wheels of the vehicles with road some energy<br>
The object of the present invention is to utilise the energy generated by this system for the various purposes, like supply of electric current to the tights on the road.<br>
Yet another object of the invented system is that to utilise and conserve the electric energy, which can be supplied to the national grid.<br>
Prior art or Existing art:<br>
There is no related prior or existing art regarding the present invented<br>
system.<br><br>
. 	When the vehicle ply on the road, there is a friction between the said rod<br>
  and the wheel of the plying vehicle thereby generating the energy. The energy<br>
  which in-torn activate generator attached to the rod thereby generating electric current This electric energy can be stored in batteries attached to the system. This  energy can be used for various useful purposes and betterment of mankind.<br><br><br><br>
	Vehicles are ply round the clock on the roads. Frictional energy generated<br>
   by tyres while vehicle is plying on the road is immense scale. If this energy    through suitable device is put to real life application, then many day-to-day life<br><br>
electricity requirements can be fulfilled.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Rollers with suitable electricity generating device attached to it are forced to rotate by friction action of running tyres. These rollers are situated across the<br><br><br>
width of the road and the level of the roller is slightly above the surface of the road such that when vehicle passes over the roller, roller will get the motion to rotate and thereby revolve the motor generator attached to it, which in turn generates the electricity.<br>
This generation of electricity is very isochronal. Therefore it needs suitable signal conditioning, storage device and inversion device. This inversion device supply AC power which, in turn, can be used effectively for different purposes. If these types of roller clusters are situated on large length of roads, then combined electricity generated can be connected to national grid system of electricity.<br>
Statement of the invention:<br>
Therefore, a non-conventional power generation system comprising of a Steel Roller, which is developed by a process of machining and curling at both ends of Steel Rod for fitting end covers; the steel roller is supported by a Shaft through it; this shaft is fitted with support ribs to facilitate support to the steel roller; the support ribs are provided to the shaft from inside the steel roller at fixed intervals; gears are fixed on both sides of shaft and at the extreme end to drive the pinions; these pinions are part of generators and are matched with the gears attached to the shaft; two separate generators are used at both ends for the purpose of generating power; bearings are fixed in the housing on both sides of the steel roller; this housing provides complete support for mounting the whole assembly and accordingly completes the construction of power generation system; when the vehicle passes over the steel roller, the contact between the tyre and the steel roller generates friction; due to friction the steel roller starts rotating which further rotates the gears attached to the shaft; since the gears start rotating, it rotates pinions and thereby activates generators; these generators starts rotating and subsequently generates power.<br>
Gear ration between roller and motor generator is so maintained that if roller makes one turn, motor generator will rotate three turns. The said housing is constructed in a way to provide support for mounting the whole assembly. The outer surface of roller pipe is machined with diamond knurling finish, so as to facilitate maximum friction between the vehicle tyre and the roller.<br><br>
                   . Description of the invention:<br>
                       NOW the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying<br>
	drawings wherein:<br>
Figure 1: is top view of complete non-conventional power syatem. Now refering to figure 1. The non-conventional power generation system comprising a thick wall steel roller (1) made by machining and having curling at both ends for fitting end covers (2), the said roller being supported by a shaft (3) passing through it, support ribs (4) being provided to the said shaft from inside the steel roller at fixed interval to facilitate support to the said roller and the roller and said shaft revolve together, ball bearings (6) being provided to support the said roller and the said ball bearings are fixed in a housing (5), gears (8) being fitted at the extreme ends of the said shaft, two separate generators (9) being used at both ends of the shaft for generation of power, pinions (7) being attached to the generators, these pinions are matched with gears attached to the shaft and the gears drive the pinions attached to generators, when the vehicle passes over the roller the contact between the steel roller and the tyre creates friction and due to friction the steel roller starts rotating which further rotates the gears attached to the shaft, since the gear starts rotating, it rotates the pinion attached to the generator and thus generates power.<br>
To sum-up following: advantages are achieved:<br>
1.	It enables to generate energy without pollution of air or noise.<br>
2.	It is very economical.<br>
3.	It can be implemented on large scale to generate more electic energy, as capital cost is less.<br>
4.	This large-scale energy generated using this system can be supplied to National grid.<br>
5.	This large-scale energy can be used for the streetlight.<br><br>
I claim;<br>
1.	The non-conventional power generation system comprising a thick wall steel roller (1) made by machining and and having curling at both ends for fitting end covers (2), the said roller being supported by a shaft (3) passing through it, support ribs (4) being provided to the said shaft from inside the steel roller at fixed interval to facilitate support to the said roller and the roller and said shaft revolve together, ball bearings (6) being provided to support the said roller and the said ball bearings are fixed in a housing (5), gears (8) being fitted at the extreme ends of the said shaft, two separate generators (9) being used at both ends of the shaft for generation of power, pinions (7) being attached to the generators, these pinions are matched with the gears attached to the shaft and the gears drive the pinions attached to generators, when the vehicle passes over the roller the contact between the steel roller and the tyre creates friction and due to friction the steel roller starts rotating which further rotates the gears attached to the shaft, since the gear starts rotating, it rotates the pinion attached to the generator and thus generates power.<br>
2.	The non-conventional power generation system as claimed in claim 1, wherein gear ratio between roller and motor generator is so maintained that if roller makes one turn, generator will rotate three turns.<br>
3.	The non-conventional power generation system as claimed in claim 1, wherein said housing is designed to provide complete support for mounting the whole assembly.<br><br>
4. The non-conventional power generation system as claimed in claim 1, wherein the outer surface of roller pipe is machined with diamond knurling finish, so as to facilitate the maximum function between the vehicle tyre and the roller.<br>
