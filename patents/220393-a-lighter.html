The invention relates to a lighter having a guard device incorporated into the lighter  Such devices help to resist undesired use of the lighter by young children.<br>
Background of The Invention Recently, attention has been directed toward preventing ready actuation of lighters by persons normally not able to appreciate the potential danger of the flame.  Such danger includes the potential to burn the individual directly or to burn surrounding areas or items.  Individuals normally contemplated in these efforts are young children in the age category of under five years of age.<br>
A conventional lighter includes a body containing a fuel reservoir filled with a liquified and pressurized hydrocarbon fuel, a valve actuator lever, a striker wheel a flint in frictional contact with the striker wheel, a fuel flow control valve in fluid communication with the fuel reservoir.  After the striker wheel is rotated against the flint by digital manipulation to produce sparks, the valve actuator lever is depressed allowing gaseous hydrocarbon fuel to flow out of the reservoir through the flow control valve. The sparks then ignite the released fuel producing a flame. Such lighters are known in the art, and are commercially available.<br>
It is desirable to increase the difficulty of use to limit the ability of young children under five years of age to operate such lighters.  For this reason there are many proposed "child-resistant" lighters offered in the patent literature and on the market.  Examples of such patents<br><br>
include United States patent No. 5,125,829; United States patent No. 5,002,482; United States patent No. 5,165,886; United States patent No. 5,090,893; and PCT Application No. WO 93/17282.  Each of the disclosed devices has in common the fact that the child-resistant feature somehow acts to block movement of the gas fuel release mechanism to prevent operation of the lighter.<br>
Although many of the currently available designs provide a degree of "child resistancy", there is a continuing search in the art for designs which are more user friendly for the intended adult to operate, while retaining their "child resistancy".<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to . provide a lighter which is operable by an adult, but resistant to operation by young children.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to provide such lighter that can be manufactured with minimal design modifications.<br>
It is' another object of the invention to provide a child-resistant feature for such a lighter that is retained so as to resist removal by the normal user.<br>
These and other objects are achieved according to the present invention by a lighter that requires at least a threshold amount of digital pressure, i.e., pressure exerted by a finger or thumb, be applied on a guard looped at least partially around the striking wheel before the striking wheel assembly can be rotated against the flint to create sparks. Further, the present invention may include brake means to prevent the striking wheel assembly from rotating after the valve actuator is depressed.<br>
These features are provided by a lighter comprising<br>
a body defining a fuel reservoir and a cylindrical cavity, and<br>
a striking wheel assembly rotatably mounted on the body at a<br>
top end, wherein the striking wheel assembly comprises a<br>
rotary sparker   one turning wheel mounted<br><br>
::axially with the rotary sparker.  The lighter further ::  a flint disposed within the cylindrical cavity and Diased into frictional contact with the rotary sparker, therein rotation of the rotary sparker against the flint creates sparks, and a valve for regulated release of fuel from the fuel reservoir to outside the body of the lighter, wherein the valve has an open position and a closed position.  The lighter further comprises a valve actuator pivotally attached to the body, wherein the actuator cooperates with the valve to nova the valve between the open position and closed position, and a windshield.<br>
The lighter of the present invention further comprises a guard disposed around the rotary sparker and preferably elevated above or outward from the at least one turning wheel, wherein the guard is depressed to a level where the at least one turning wheel can be manipulated. Additionally, the guard has a spark orifice or other passageway disposed between the fuel valve and the striking wheel assembly to allow the spark to pass therethrough and to reach the fuel valve.  Additionally, the guard may further comprise at least one brake member, preferably disposed on the inside surface of the guard, to resist rotation of the rotary sparker unless the guard is properly manipulated.<br>
One or more additional or alternative braking members may be defined on the valve actuator of the lighter. Preferably, the one or more braking members of the valve actuator have a plurality of teeth on one side, wherein after the valve actuator is depressed and the valve is moved to the open position, the teeth of the one or more brake members arrest the rotation of the striking wheel assembly.<br>
Thus, a lighter having the above described guard features and braking members should provide a young child with sufficient deterrent features as to prevent the child from readily producing a flame, or to deter the child from readily producing a flame at least for a time sufficient to. permit the normally expected adult intervention.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a lighter comprising: a lighter body containing a fuel reservoir with a valve for releasing fuel therefrom; spark producing element rotatable by a user to produce sparks directed towards the valve, the element mounted on the body with at least a portion thereof exposed for manipulation and rotation by the user; a valve actuator depressible to actuate the valve and release the fuel; and a guard member extending at least from the valve actuator over at least a portion of the spark producing element and back to the valve actuator wherein at least a portion of the guard member is elevated above at least a portion of the spark producing element to inhibit manipulation of the spark producing element, the guard member is depressible to a portion permitting manipulation of the spark producing element.<br>

Detailed Description of The Preferred Embodiments<br>
Referring to the drawings, wherein like reference numbers are used to designate like parts and as shown in FIG. 1, lighter 10 according to the present invention is shown having a guard 60 disposed above and around striking wheel assembly 14.  The lighter also includes windshield 50,. mounted on top of body 12 and around the fuel release valve as is known.  <br><br>
More particularly shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, lighter 10 has body 12 with striking wheel assembly 14 rotatably disposed between sparkwheel supports 15 via axle 16.  Striking wheel assembly 14 is located at the top end of body 12 and comprises<br>
; turning wheels 18 preferably disposed on each side of rotary sparker 20.  Turning wheels 18 and sparker 20 are connected to one another, and are mounted coaxially on axle 16.  Body 12 defines a cylindrical cavity 22 positioned longitudinally and centrally within body 12.  Flint 24 is disposed within cavity<br>
I 22, and is urged into frictional contact with rotary sparker 2 0 by spring 26.<br>
Lighter 10 further comprises a valve actuator 28, which is pivotally mounted on body 12 through tabs 30, which are located below axle 16.  As shown in FIGS. 5-7, valve<br>
i actuator 28 defines slot 32 at one end (which may be closed or open),  At the ether end of the valve actuator 28 is thumb pad 36.  In its middle region, valve actuator 28 defines an opening 37, which allows flint 24 to extend from lighter body 12 through valve actuator 28 to contact rotary sparker 20.<br>
)	Valve 40 controls the release of fuel from reservoir<br>
42.  In a preferred embodiment, valve 40 is a normally open valve, forced open by the pressure of fuel within reservoir 42.  In this embodiment, as shown in FIG. 2, valve actuator 28 acts on valve 40 to maintain it in a closed position.<br>
) Compression spring 44 pushes up on a first end of valve actuator 28, forcing the second, opposite end to act downwardly on valve 40 where it extends through slot 32.  This pressure maintains the valve in a closed position until thumb pad 36 is sufficiently depressed allowing nozzle 34 of valve<br>
3 40 to be lifted and thereby releasing the fuel.  If desired, second compression spring 38 can be included to act between the valve actuator and valve stem to delay release of fuel before the thumb pad is depressed to a predetermined position. It is contemplated that other suitable valve configurations<br>
5 may be selected by persons of ordinary skill in the art. For example  valye, which is forced open by the lifting of the second end of the vile actuator due to<br><br>
depression of the thumb pad may be utilized.  Also, second spring 38 may be omitted.  The principal purpose of second spring 38 is to delay release of fuel due to tolerances in the mechanism or slight depression of the valve actuator. However, because the guard of the present invention is intended to inhibit the creation of sparks to ignite the fuel, such a feature may be omitted.<br>
Guard 60, shown in FIG. 10, is disposed around striking wheel assembly 14, as shown in FIGS. 2 and 11.  Guard 60 has first end 66 with spark orifice 68 wherein the spark orifice is disposed between striking wheel assembly 14 and fuel valve 40 to permit passage of sparks from the flint to the released fuel.  Also, a portion of raised boss 17 of lighter body 12 (more particularly shown in FIG. 9) passes through at least a portion of orifice 68.  Guard 60 further comprises second end 70 with opening 72 disposed around boss 17 such that spark orifice 68 and opening 72 overlap at least partially such that guard 60 forms a closed loop, as shown in FIG. 11.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 2, 3, 4 and 11, at least the portion of guard 60 extending from top of shield 50 over the top of striking wheel assembly 14 to the top of thumb pad 3 6 is shaped and dimensioned to fit over the rotary sparker 20, and positioned radially beyond and above the turning wheels 18.  However, the width of at least said portion of guard, 60 is such that it extends between but preferably not over turning wheels 18.  Guard 60 is preferably elevated above the surfaces of the turning wheels 18, such that guard 60 should be depressed before turning wheels 18 can be rotated.<br>
As stated above, to produce a flame, the user depresses guard 60.  Responding to the exerted pressure on guard 60, the guard is deformed, thereby producing an elastic deflection.  After the applied pressure is relieved, guard 60 will resume its former shape and position.  Alternatively, the guard may be configured and dimensioned such that depression is not required instead, the size and pulp portion of an<br><br>
adult user's finger are sufficient to manipulate the spark wheels without depressing the guard.<br>
To operate the lighter of the present invention the user asserts a sufficient pressure greater than a predetermined pressure necessary to deform guard 60, such that guard 60 at least partially moves to a position closer to the turning wheels 18, or to a position between the turning wheels 18, to permit the user's finger to engage the wheels for rotation.<br>
Alternatively, it is not necessary to deform guard 60.  If guard 60 is positioned such that the fleshy, pulp portion of the adult user's finger is sufficient to extend over and around guard portion 60, the adult's finger can contact turning wheels 18 for rotation without such deformation.  Preferably, rotation of the turning wheels would be a result of a combination of both types of action, i.e., the deformation of the guard and the extension of the adult finger partially around the guard.  It has been found that a guard made of a grade of steel that when hardened by heat treatment or other method would provide spring like properties is preferable.  The guard may have thickness preferably under about 0.050 inches.  As will be appreciated by persons of ordinary skill in the art, other materials, hardnesses and thicknesses may be used.  Based on the teachings of the present invention as set forth herein, a person of ordinary skill in the art could adapt the present invention as desired. Rotation of the turning wheels 18 causes a spark to be produced in a conventional manner.  After the spark is produced by rotation of the turning wheels 18, the user's<br>
I finger depresses the thumb pad 3 6 on the valve actuator 28 to actuate a release of fuel from the valve 40.  This action occurs after the creation of the spark, as shown in FIG. 18. When rotated with sufficient force by an adult user, the spark created is large enough to ignite the fuel even though it is<br>
5 normally not released until a period of time after the creation of the spark.<br><br>
The lighter as described above, is child resistant because generally children under five years of age do not have sufficient coordination, digit size or strength to operate the present invention as described.<br>
Because guard 60 forms part of the resistancy of the lighter, it is advantageous to resist or make more difficult the removal of guard 60.  The configuration of guard 60 of the present invention therefore makes the removal of guard 60 more difficult.  In the first embodiment of the present invention (shown in FIG. 2, 10, and 11), first end 66 and second end 70 of guard 60 disposed around boss 17 retains guard 60 in a closed loop.  Guard 60 is further mounted to lighter body 12 by being disposed around striking wheel assembly 14 which in turn is mounted by being disposed between spark wheel supports 15 (FIGS. 8 and 9) via axle 16.<br>
Alternatively, first end and second end of guard 60 may also extend beyond the closed loop.  Examples of such guards are shown in FIGS. 12, 13, and 15, which show perspective views of arcuate guards comprising a first end with one or more prongs at a predetermined distance apart. Such guards further comprise a second end with one prong whose width, at least where first end and second end intersect, is equal to or less than the predetermined distance between the two prongs of first end.  In addition, second end is disposed between the two prongs of first end.<br>
FIG. 12 shows a guard 60A with first end 74 and second end 78 facing fuel valve 40. FIG. 14 illustrates a guard as in FIG. 12 disposed around striking wheel assembly 14.  Two prongs 76 of first end 74 are disposed between striking wheel assembly 14 and fuel valve 40 and positioned such that the space between the two prongs allows sparks to pass to fuel valve 40.  Guard 6OA further comprises hole 80 which lies just before second end 78 and is disposed around boss 17.  Second end 78 rests on or below valve actuator 28 wherein the second end terminates with a curved hook or lip 82.  Valve actuator 28 defines a recessed pocket 84 wherein<br>
- - -——	      III r<br>
the curved hook or lip 82 rests in recessed pocket 84.  First<br><br>
end 74 passes through opening 37 defined in valve actuator 28. In a further alternative embodiment of this design, second end 78 rests on a portion of the lighter body and lip 82 is received in a pocket in the lighter body.<br>
Similarly, in another embodiment as shown in FIG. 13, first end 8 6 of guard 60B rests on valve actuator 28, wherein each prong 88 of first end 86 terminates with a curved hook or lip 90.  FIG. 14 also illustrates a guard as in FIG. 13 disposed around striking wheel assembly 14.  (Guards 60A and GOB appear similar in side view).  As shown in FIG. 14, curved hook or lip 90 rests in one or more recessed pockets 84 of valve actuator 28.  The. one or more recessed pockets also accommodate first end 86.  Guard 60B further comprises opening 92 which may be an extension of the predetermined distance between two prongs 88 of first end 86.  Second end 93 preferably has a predetermined width, at least in a region where spark passes, such that sparks can pass there around to ignite fuel escaping from the valve.  Alternatively, second end 93 may provide a spark orifice such that sparks can pass therethrough.  Second end 93 passes through opening 37 defined in valve actuator 28.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 15, first end 94 and second end 98 of guard 60C may alternatively face thumb pad 36.  FIG. 16 shows guard 60C of FIG. 15 disposed around striking wheel assembly 14.  Guard 60C comprises spark orifice 100 disposed between striking wheel assembly 14 and fuel valve 40.  Second end 98 passes through opening 37 defined in valve actuator 28 and first end 94 rests on valve actuator 28.  First end 94 further comprises one or more tabs 102 disposed on  one or both of two prongs 96 wherein each tab 102 -engages a lip 104 disposed under thumb pad 36.  Guard 60 further comprises opening 101 disposed around boss 17'wherein opening 101 may be an extension of a distance between prongs 96.  When lighter 10 is in the inoperative position, engagement of tab 102 with lip 104 may act against depression of thumb pad 36.  After guard 60C IS 'depre^sedT^ tab 102 disengages lip 104 and thus valve actuator 28 is free to actuate fuel valve 40-<br><br>
In another embodiment of the guard of the present invention, the ends of the guard do not overlap.  For example, FIGS. 17 and 18 show two different embodiments of guard 60D wherein first end 106 and second end 108 are disposed around boss 17, as shown in FIG. 19.  Guard 600 further comprises spark orifice 110 disposed between striking wheel assembly 14 and valve actuator 40.  First end 106 and second end 108 exert a spring compression force on each other and/or on boss 17, thereby resulting in a clamping force around boss 17.  Boss 17 may also define one or more notches 114 to accommodate first end 106 and second end 108 of guard 60D.  As shown in FIG. 18, guard 60D may further comprise one or more openings and/or slits 112 for increased flexibility of guard 60D.<br>
The guard according to the present invention may also be formed as a continuous loop, such that the first and second ends are joined together.  Examples of such a guard are shown in FIGS. 20 and 21.  In FIG. 20, guard 60E comprises a spark orifice 116 disposed between striking wheel assembly 14 and fuel valve 40, as shown in FIG. 22-  Guard 60E further comprises a hole 118 disposed around boss 17.  FIG. 21 shows a similar guard 60E but further comprising one or more openings and/or slits 120 for increased flexibility of the guard.<br>
The guard of the present invention may alternatively be formed as a partial loop comprising various retaining means linked to shield 50, lighter body 12 and/or activator 28.  An example of such an embodiment is shown in FIGS. 23 and 24, wherein FIG. 23 shows a side view of guard 60F and FIG. 24 shows a front view of guard 60F.  Furthermore, FIG. 25 shows guard 60F of FIGS. 23 and 24 disposed at least partially around striking wheel assembly 14.  This guard and the embodiments shown in FIGS. 26, 28, and 30 extend more than about 180*" around the striking wheel assembly and preferably extend at least approximately 270*' around the striking Wheel assembly.  This permits the guards to extend to or beyond the valve actuator on both sides of the spark wheel to provide retention meahs separate from the windshield.<br><br>
Guard 60F comprises at least one first retaining member 122 which is fitted under shield 50.  Retaining member 122 may be stamped from guard 60.  Guard 60F further comprises a first end 124 disposed between fuel valve 40 and striking ^heel assembly 14.  First end 124 defines opening 128 wherein spark may pass therethrough.  Opening 128 may be a slot as shown in FIG. 24.  First end 124 extends down through cavity J7 of valve actuator 28 and terminates with at least one second retaining member 12 6 which further increases the retention of guard 60F by engaging under the valve actuator. Second end 130 of guard 60F extends down through cavity 37 and Ls disposed between thumb pad 3 6 and striking wheel assembly L4.  Second end 130 comprises lock tab 132 and terminates with look 134.  As shown in FIG. 25, lock tab 132 and hook 134 may )oth be used to retain guard 60F with first boss 136 and second boss 138, respectively, defined on lighter body 12.<br>
