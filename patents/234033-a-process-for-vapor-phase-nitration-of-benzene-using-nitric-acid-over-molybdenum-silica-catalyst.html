				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for vapor phase nitration of benzene using<br>
nitric acid over molybdenum silica catalyst.<br>
The invention particularly relates to a process for the preparation of mono-nitrobenzene<br>
wherein the nitration of benzene is carried out in vapor phase using molybdenum silica catalyst<br>
and nitric acid. By the process of present invention nitrobenzene has been prepared in high yield<br>
in a continuous process without any waste byproduct formation making it an environment<br>
friendly process.<br>
Major part of nitrobenzene (95% or more) produced is converted to aniline, which has<br>
hundreds of downstream products. Nitrobenzene also is used as a processing solvent in specific<br>
chemical reactions. Conventionally nitrobenzene is produced by liquid phase reactions<br>
employing mixed acids. A suiruric acid/nitric acid mixture is the most commonly used nitrating<br>
agent. Generation of large amount dilute sulfuric acid, organic wastes and products of their<br>
neutralization makes the benzene nitration one of the most environmentally harmful processes.<br>
Vapor-phase nitration of benzene to nitrobenzene over zeolite is expected to be a clean<br>
process without sulfuric acid waste. A number of heterogeneous catalysts have been proposed<br>
for this process.<br>
In the prior art, vapor phase nitration of aromatic compounds, benzene and toluene at<br>
temperature ranging from about 275° C to about 310° C is described in McKee and Wilhelm,<br>
Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, 28(6), 662-667 (1936) and U.S. Pat. No. 2,109,873.<br>
McKee and Wilhelm catalyzed their reaction with silica gel. Bauxite and alumina were reported<br>
to be ineffective as catalyst in the vapor phase nitration of benzene.<br>
US. Patent No. 2,431.585 describes vapor phase nitration of aromatic hydrocarbons at<br>
temperature from 130°C to 430°C, using metal phosphates of calcium, iron, magnesium and solid<br>
supported phosphoric acid catalysts.<br>
U.S. patent 4551568 describes the vapor phase nitration of benzene over solid mixed<br>
oxide catalyst comprising WCh and MOa, which exhibited a fairly high and stable activity.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 3,966,830, Jpn. Pat. No. 58-157748, and U.S. Pat. No. 4, 426, 543<br>
describe the nitration of aromatics using zeolite catalysts. The lower conversion of benzene to<br>
nitrobenzene and faster deactivation of zeolite catalysts are the drawbacks of these processes for<br>
commercial application.<br>
US patent 5030776 describes a process for nitrating benzene using nitric acid as a<br>
nitrating agent under continuous or intermittent feeding of sulfuric acid as a catalyst on a solid<br>
carrier. Vapor phase nitration of benzene has been claimed in US patent 5.004,846 wherein nitric<br>
acid is used as a nitrating agent and a composite oxide or acidic sheet clay mineral ion<br>
exchanged with polyvalent metal as a catalyst.<br>
International patent WO 96/36587 describes a solvent free process for the nitration of<br>
aromatic compounds in which the aromatic compound is reacted with nitric acid in presence of<br>
an acid anhydride wherein the process is catalyzed by an aluminosilicate catalyst. Nitric acid and<br>
acid anhydride react with each other in-situ to form acyl nitrate and this acts as a nitrating agent<br>
for aromatic compounds. For example benzene, naphthalene, anthracene, toluene etc. are nitrated<br>
to mononitrated compounds. A mixture of orth-meta-para nitrotoluenes is obtained which is then<br>
distilled at a pressure of 30 mmHg and a temperature of 30UC to remove acetic acid as a<br>
byproduct.<br>
These prior art processes for the vapor phase nitration of benzene for the preparation of<br>
nitrobenzene have the limitations of low conversions low space-time yield, low yield, short<br>
catalyst life, contamination of the products by undesirable by-products and the complicated<br>
nature of catalysts. These prior art processes use concentrated nitric acid as nitrating agent,<br>
which leads to the oxidation products deactivating the catalyst.<br>
The novelty of the present invention lies in the use of xMo03: (1-x) SiO2 catalyst with or<br>
without promotor for vapour phase nitration of benzene in high yield and selectivity for nitro<br>
benzene.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a process for vapor phase<br>
nitration of benzene using nitric acid and over molybdenum silica catalyst.<br>
Another object of the present invention is use of ethyl silicate-40 as silica source for the<br>
preparation of high surface area MoCVSiCh catalyst.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is the use of xMoO3: (1-x) SiO2 catalyst,<br>
where x = 0.05-0.2, preferably x = 0.2 for vapor phase nitration of benzene using nitric acid and<br>
over molybdenum silica catalyst.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for vapor phase nitration of benzene using<br>
nitric acid over molybdenum silica catalyst comprising reacting benzene with nitric acid along with an inert gas a conventional downflow reactor containing inert ceramic packing as preheater and granulated molybdenum silica catalyst of composition Mo03: (1-x) SiO2, wherein x = 0.05-0.2 with or without 0.5-2%) of a transition metal oxide as a promotor, at a temperature in the range of 100-250°C, at a reactant weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) in the range of 0.15 to 0.5, condensing the resultant product followed by washing with known alkali to obtain mono-nitrobenzene.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the catalyst used is in the form of a pellet.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the mesh size of granulated molybdenum silica catalyst used is in the range of -10 to +20 mesh size.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the catalyst used is M0O3: (1-x) SiO2 where x is 0.2.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the MoCVSiO2 catalyst used is in amorphous or crystalline form.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the molybdenum silica catalyst is in amorphous form.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the molybdenum silica catalyst is used along with a promoter comprising 1-2% transition metal oxides selected from the group consisting of Fe2O3, CuO, NiO and Co3O4.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the promoter is Fe2O3<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the nitric acid used is 10 to 70% nitric acid.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the molar ratio of nitric acid to benzene is in the range of 4:1 tol: 4,preferably 1:2.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the nitration is carried out in a conventional downflow reactor containing inert ceramic packing as preheater.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the molybdenum silica catalyst used is M0O3: (1-x) SiO2, wherein x is preferably 0.2.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the nitration is carried out at a temperature preferably in the range of 120-200°C and at a reactant weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) in the range of 0.1 to 1.0.<br><br>
