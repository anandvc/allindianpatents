The present invention relates to a novel article in sheet form and to a method for the<br>
manufacture thereof.<br>
More specifically the present invention relates to a novel article in sheet form<br>
featuring lightness, heat-insulating and sound-insulating properties.<br>
It is known that for the production of dividing walls, in most cases panels made of<br>
wood or materials generally referred to as "plasterboard" are used.<br>
Wood panels, in addition to the high intrinsic cost of the material, also pose the<br>
problem of their considerable weight in cases where the walls must be of a suitable strength<br>
and robustness and provide good sound insulation; wood is moreover highly combustible and<br>
prone to rot. In addition to these problems there is also the difficulty of manufacturing<br>
panels which have large dimensions.<br>
Plasterboard walls, for their part, have a low mechanical strength and rather poor<br>
heat- and sound-insulating properties.<br>
For many years a technology (which combines a process and a plant) known as<br>
Bretonstone System has been known, this technology being used for the manufacture of<br>
articles made of a stone conglomerate, in particular articles in the form of sheets or blocks,<br>
and composed essentially of the following operations (with reference here to the manufacture<br>
of articles in sheet form):<br>
-	preparing an initial mix consisting of a granular material of predefined and selected<br>
particle size and a binder, which in general terms may be cement-based or consist of a<br>
hardening resin, the granular material being chosen from among ground stone materials and<br>
ceramic materials and consisting partly of an inorganic material, preferably very fine marble or<br>
quartz (particle size of about 325-400 mesh), called "filler" in industrial practice;<br>
-	depositing the mix on a temporary support in the form of a layer of predetermined<br>
thickness;<br>
-	applying to the layer of mix, kept under a predefined vacuum, a compaction pressure<br>
together with a vibrating movement of predefined frequency (this step will be referred herein<br>
as vacuum vibrocompression);<br>
-	hardening the resultant compacted article (subsequently to a setting step in the case<br>
of a cement-based binder).<br>
Recently, the Applicant has developed a variant of the aforementioned technology,<br><br>
using a silica-based watery substance as binder.<br>
In a first preferred embodiment, said binder consists of an aqueous dispersion of<br>
colloidal silica, also known as "silica sol".<br>
In a second preferred embodiment, said binder consists of an aqueous solution of a<br>
sodium or potassium silicate mixed with zinc oxide.<br>
More specifically, the Applicant has developed a method for manufacturing articles<br>
adopting the Bretonstone system and therefore the steps indicated above, said method being<br>
characterized in that: <br>
(1)	the binder used for preparation of the starting mix is silica sol, namely a<br>
dispersion, in the aqueous phase, of particles of colloidal silica with nanometric dimensions,<br>
or, alternatively, an aqueous solution of a mixture formed by a sodium or potassium silicate,<br>
in which the proportion of silica and sodium oxide or potassium oxide, respectively, is<br>
between 2 and 4, and by zinc oxide in a proportion of between 5 and 35% by weight;<br>
(2)	after the vacuum vibrocompression step, the resultant rough-formed sheet is<br>
heated with a predefined temperature gradient up to a temperature of 80-120Â°C for a few<br>
hours, until a substantially complete evaporation of the water present in the sheet is achieved,<br>
resulting in a rough-formed article which is sufficiently strong to allow handling thereof, but<br>
has a porosity corresponding to the empty spaces left by mix water removed by means of<br>
evaporation;<br>
(3)	the rough-formed sheet obtained in the predous step is impregnated with a<br>
hardening resin so as to fill the pores, after which the final step of hardening the hardening<br>
resin which has penetrated into the sheet is performed.<br>
In connection with the first characterising feature of the method indicated above,<br>
when an aqueous dispersion of colloidal silica (also known as silica sol) is used as a binder,<br>
this is a binder which is already used in other fields, for example in molding sands, does not<br>
require the use of a solvent and is particularly valued since it is non-polluting.<br>
However, as is well-known, in the case of molding sands, the aggregation of the sand<br>
in order to form articles such as the so-called cores must have only a temporary duration, i.e.<br>
until the metal is cast, following which the sand is recovered in loose form. Therefore, the<br>
mechanical properties of the article are of very limited importance and in particular properties<br>
such as sound insulation, heat insulation and breathability (understood as meaning the<br>
capacity to prevent the passage of liquids, but not that of air and vapours) are of no interest.<br>
It has now been discovered, this forming the object of the present invention, that by<br>
adopting the method of the Bretonstone system, suitably modified both as regards the<br>
composition of the starting mixture and as regards the aplication steps, it is possible to<br>
produce articles in the form of sheets having desired characteristics such as lightness, heat<br><br>
and sound insulation, breathability and adequate mechanical strength.<br>
This object is achieved by the method in question where the initial mixture comprises<br>
a granular inorganic inert material which is expanded and consequently leightweight, a filler<br>
formed by hollow inorganic microspheres and clayand a binder consisting of the already<br>
mentioned silica sol or, alternatively, the said aqueous solution of a mixture formed by a<br>
sodium or potassium silicate and zinc oxide, having a concentration of 24 degrees Baume,<br>
namely, a relative density of 1,1933 g/cm3.<br>
The mediod is moreover modified in that the step involving impregnation with<br>
hardening resin is omitted, since it has the main aim of making the article resistant to the <br>
penetration of water.<br>
The resultant article in sheet form has distinctive features such as:<br>
-	a specific weight of less than 1, usually in the region of 0.8 kg/dm3;<br>
-	a mechanical flexural/tensile strength, of about 30 kg/cm2 (3 N/mm2);<br>
-	a porosity of about 10% by volume;<br>
-	a rating of fire reaction (inflammability) in class 0, when the initial mixture does not<br>
contain organic and therefore inflammable components such as cellulose, replacing - though<br>
partially -the clay.<br>
The resultant sheets may then be used both for dividing walls and as internal panels<br>
and for external use since they may be finished by means of a conventional plastering or<br>
painting which increases the resistance to the action of atmospheric agents.<br>
As regards the components of the starting mixture, about 60% by volume consists of <br>
the expanded lightweight granular inert material, which is preferably glass or ceramic<br>
material.<br>
The materials in question are commercially available (for example, under the name of<br>
Leca, Poraver or Liaver) so that further details are not necessary. The particle size thereof is<br>
chosen to ensure optimum filling of the mixture, for example in accordance with the weE-<br>
known Bolomey's formula (a formula commonly used in the preparation of cement-based<br>
mixtures).<br>
In the application of the formula according to the present invention, the particle size<br>
range of this granular material is between 0.1 and 12 mm and preferabry between 0.5 and 6<br>
mm, divided into a suitable number of fractions, normally four. The quantity of granular<br>
material included in each fraction is chosen precisely taking into account Bolomey's formula.<br>
If we consider now the filler, which forms about 24% by volume of the initial mix, it<br>
is essentially in the form of a fine powder and comprises about 12% of hollow organic<br>
microspheres, preferably fillite, said material consisting of microgranules of expanded<br>
siliceous material obtained from the ashes of coal-fired power stations, with a particle size of<br>
between 90 and 150 microns.<br><br>
The remaining 12% of the filler phase comprises a clay-like mineral which has the<br>
function of imparting plasticity to the initial mix. Precisely in order to control the degree of<br>
plasticity, part of the clay-like material is normally replaced with quartz powder or other stone<br>
material such as feldspar or marble.<br>
In the practical embodiment of the present invention about 50% of the clay-like<br>
material is replaced with cristobalite in powder form.<br>
If it is required to increase the flexural strength of the articles in sheet form obtained<br>
by the present invention, the two opposite surfaces may be covered, prior to vacuum<br>
vibrocompression, with a fibreglass meshwork which remains incorporated within the<br>
surfaces of the article.<br>
An important feature of the present invention consists in the fact that it is also<br>
possible to produce articles in sheet form of a considerable thickness (about 10-15 cm).<br>
The examples below illustrate the present invention in a non-limiting way.<br>
Example 1<br>
In a plant for performing vacuum vibrocompression, a mixture comprising the<br>
following components is prepared:<br>
-	expanded granular glass material<br>
(0.5-6 mm)	60% by volume<br>
-	fillite	12% by volume<br>
-	clay and cristobalite (less<br>
than 20 microns)	12% by volume<br>
-	silica sol	16% by volume<br>
In the deposition step this mixture is deposited on a support, forming a layer with a<br>
thickness of about 9 cm.<br>
The deposited layer, onto the associated support, is transferred to the vacuum<br>
vibrocompression station, where a pressure of about 1 kg/cm2 for a duration of about 60 s<br>
under a residual pressure of about 20 mbar is applied by means of a pressing plate. At the<br>
same time a vibratory movement at a frequency of about 60 Hz is applied.<br>
The resultant rough-formed sheet is transferred to a drying oven where it undergoes<br>
heating at a temperature of about 90Â°C for a duration of 10-12 hours.<br>
The resultant article in sheet form, which has a specific weight of about 0.82 kg/dm3<br>
and is therefore very light, has a thickness of 33 mm and a mechanical flexural/tensile<br>
strength of about 3 N/mm3.<br>
	Example 2<br>
Example 1 is repeated except that the following modifications are made.<br>
The quantity of clay is increased by 1% by volume, reducing correspondingly the<br><br>
quantity of cristobalite, so that the plasticity of the mix increases.<br>
In this way it is possible to produce an article in sheet form of a smaller thickness,<br>
which in this case is 23 mm, while the physical and mechanical properties of the resultant<br>
article remain unchanged.<br>
It is worth noting that, by the method according to the present invention, sheets of<br>
considerable dimensions, about 1.5 x 3.2 m, may be manufactured, so that the formation of<br>
dividing walls and partitions is also made a lot easier.<br>
As mentioned above, the clay-like material may be partly or totally replaced with<br>
cellulose, which has the same effect of imparting plasticity to the initial mix.<br>
However, in the case of cellulose, the presence of this organic component is to the<br>
detriment of the total non-inflammability which instead characterizes those articles in which<br>
only inorganic components such as clay and cristobalite are used in the initial mix.<br>
The invention has been described in connection with a preferred embodiment, it<br>
being understood that conceptually equivalent modifications and variants are possible and<br>
may be envisaged without departing from the scope of protection thereof, as defined in the<br>
appended claims.<br>
In particular, the articles in sheet form according to the present invention may be used<br>
not only for dividing walls and partitions but also for other purposes.<br><br>
