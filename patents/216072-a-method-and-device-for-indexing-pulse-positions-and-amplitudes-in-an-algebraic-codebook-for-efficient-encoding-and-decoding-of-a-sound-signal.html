				<td>A METHOD AND DEVICE FOR INDEXING PULSE POSITIONS<br>
AND AMPLITUDES IN AN ALGEBRAIC CODEBOOK FOR<br>
EFFICIENT ENCODING AND DECODING OF A SOUND SIGNAL<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method and device for indexing pulse<br>
positions and amplitudes in an algebraic codebook for efficient encoding and<br>
decoding of a sound signal, in particular but not exclusively a speech signal, in view<br>
of transmitting and synthesizing this signal. More specifically, the present invention<br>
is concerned with a method for indexing the pulse positions and amplitudes of non-<br>
zero-amplitude pulses, in particular but not exclusively in very large algebraic<br>
codebooks needed for high-quality coding of wideband signals based on Algebraic<br>
Code Excited Linear Prediction (ACELP) techniques.<br>
Brief description of the current technology:<br>
The demand for efficient digital wideband speech/audio encoding techniques<br>
with a good subjective quality/bit rate trade-off is increasing for numerous<br>
applications such as audio/video teleconferencing, multimedia, and wireless<br>
applications, as well as internet and packet network applications. Until recently,<br>
telephone bandwidths filtered in the range 200-3400 Hz were mainly used in<br>
speech coding applications. However, there is an increasing demand for<br><br>
wideband speech applications in order to increase the intelligibility and<br>
naturalness of the speech signals. A bandwidth in the range 50-7000 Hz<br>
was found sufficient for delivering a face-to-face speech quality. For<br>
audio signals, this range gives an acceptable audio quality, but is still<br>
lower than the CD (Compact Disk) quality which operates in the range<br>
20-20000 Hz.<br>
A speech encoder converts a speech signal into a digital<br>
bitstream which is transmitted over a communication channel (or stored<br>
in a storage medium). The speech signal is digitized (sampled and<br>
quantized with usually 16-bits per sample) and the speech encoder has<br>
the role of representing these digital samples with a smaller number of<br>
bits while maintaining a good subjective speech quality. The speech<br>
decoder or synthesizer operates on the transmitted or stored bitstream<br>
and converts it back to a sound signal.<br>
One of the best prior art techniques capable of achieving a<br>
good quality/bit rate trade-off is the so-called CELP (Code Excited Linear<br>
Prediction) technique. According to this technique, the sampled speech<br>
signal is processed in successive blocks of L samples usually called<br>
frames where L is some predetermined number (corresponding to 10-30<br>
ms of speech). In CELP, a LP (Linear Prediction) synthesis filter is<br>
computed and transmitted every frame. The L-sample frame is then<br>
divided into smaller blocks called subframes of size N samples, where<br>
L=kN and k is the number of subframes in a frame (A/ usually<br>
corresponds to 4-10 ms of speech). An excitation signal is determined in<br>
each subframe, which usually consists of two components: one from the<br>
past excitation (also called pitch contribution or adaptive codebook) and<br>
the other from an innovative codebook (also called fixed codebook). This<br><br>
excitation signal is transmitted and used at the decoder as the input of<br>
the LP synthesis filter in order to obtain the synthesized speech.<br>
To synthesize speech according to the CELP technique,<br>
each block of N samples is synthesized by filtering an appropriate<br>
codevector from the innovation codebook through time-varying filters<br>
modeling the spectral characteristics of the speech signal. These filters<br>
consist of a pitch synthesis filter (usually implemented as an adaptive<br>
codebook containing the past excitation signal) and an LP synthesis<br>
filter. At the encoder end, the synthesis output is computed for all, or a<br>
subset, of the codevectors from the codebook (codebook search). The<br>
retained codevector is the one producing the synthesis output closest to<br>
the original speech signal according to a perceptually weighted distortion<br>
measure. This perceptual weighting is performed using a so-called<br>
perceptual weighting filter, which is usually derived from the LP<br>
synthesis filter.<br>
An innovative codebook in the CELP context, is an indexed<br>
set of N-sample-long sequences which will be referred to as N-<br>
dimensional codevectors. Each codebook sequence is indexed by an<br>
integer k ranging from 1 to M where M represents the size of the<br>
codebook often expressed as a number of bits b, where M=2b.<br>
A codebook can be stored in a physical memory, e.g. a<br>
look-up table (stochastic codebook), or can refer to a mechanism for<br>
relating the index to a corresponding codevector, e.g. a formula<br>
(algebraic codebook).<br>
A drawback of the first type of codebooks, stochastic<br>
codebooks, is that they often involve substantial physical storage. They<br><br>
are stochastic, i.e. random in the sense that the path from the index to<br>
the associated codevector involves look-up tables which are the result of<br>
randomly generated numbers or statistical techniques applied to large<br>
speech training sets. The size of stochastic codebooks tends to be<br>
limited by storage and/or search complexity.<br>
The second type of codebooks are the algebraic<br>
codebooks. By contrast with the stochastic codebooks, algebraic<br>
codebooks are not random and require no substantial storage. An<br>
algebraic codebook is a set of indexed codevectors of which the<br>
amplitudes and positions of the pulses of the kth codevector can be<br>
derived from a corresponding index k through a rule requiring no, or<br>
minimal, physical storage. Therefore, the size of algebraic codebooks is<br>
not limited by storage requirements. Algebraic codebooks can also be<br>
designed for efficient search.<br>
The CELP model has been very successful in encoding<br>
telephone band sound signals, and several CELP-based standards exist<br>
in a wide range of applications, especially in digital cellular applications.<br>
In the telephone band, the sound signal is band-limited to 200-3400 Hz<br>
and sampled at 8000 samples/sec. In wideband speech/audio<br>
applications, the sound signal is band-limited to 50-7000 Hz and<br>
sampled at 16000 samples/sec.<br>
Some difficulties arise when applying the telephone band<br>
optimized CELP model to wideband signals, and additional features<br>
need to be added to the model in order to obtain high quality wideband<br>
signals. These features include efficient perceptual weighting filtering,<br>
varying bandwith pitch filtering, and efficient gain smoothing and pitch<br>
enhancement techniques. An other important issue that arise in coding<br><br>
wideband signals is the need to use very large excitation codebooks.<br>
Therefore, efficient codebook structures that require minimal storage<br>
and can be rapidly searched become very important. Algebraic<br>
codebooks have been known for their efficiciency and are now widely<br>
used in various speech coding standards. Algebraic codebooks and<br>
related fast search procedures are described in US patents Nos:<br>
5,444,816 (Adoul et al.) issued on August 22, 1995; 5,699,482 granted<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
As well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, a cellular<br>
communication system such as 401 (Figure 4) provides a<br>
telecommunication service over a large geographic area by dividing that<br>
large geographic area into a number C of smaller cells. The C smaller<br>
cells are serviced by respective cellular base stations 4021, 4022... 402c<br>
to provide each cell with radio signalling, audio and data channels.<br>
Radio signalling channels are used to place calls to mobile<br>
radiotelephones (mobile transmitter/receiver units) such as 403 within<br>
the limits of the coverage area (cell) of the cellular base station 402, and<br>
to place calls to other radiotelephones 403 located either inside or<br>
outside the base station"s cell or to another network such as the Public<br>
Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) 404.<br>
Once a radiotelephone 403 has successfully placed or<br>
received a call, an audio or data channel is established between this<br>
radiotelephone 403 and the cellular base station 402 corresponding to<br>
the cell in which the radiotelephone 403 is situated, and communication<br>
between the base station 402 and radiotelephone 403 is conducted over<br>
that audio or data channel. The radiotelephone 403 may also receive<br>
control or timing information over a signalling channel while a call is in<br>
progress.<br><br>
If a radiotelephone 403 leaves a cell and enters another<br>
adjacent cell while a call is in progress, the radiotelephone 403 hands<br>
over the call to an available audio or data channel of the new cell base<br>
station 402. If a radiotelephone 403 leaves a cell and enters another<br>
adjacent cell while no call is in progress, the radiotelephone 403 sends a<br>
control message over the signalling channel to log into the base station<br>
402 of the new cell. In this manner mobile communication over a wide<br>
geographical area is possible.<br>
The cellular communication system 401 further comprises<br>
a control terminal 405 to control communication between the cellular<br>
base stations 402 and the PSTN 404, for example during a<br>
communication between a radiotelephone 403 and the PSTN 404, or<br>
between a radiotelephone 403 located in a first cell and a radiotelephone<br>
403 situated in a second cell.<br>
Of course, a bidirectional wireless radio communication<br>
subsystem is required to establish an audio or data channel between a<br>
base station 402 of one cell and a radiotelephone 403 located in that<br>
cell. As illustrated in very simplified form in Figure 4, such a bidirectional<br>
wireless radio communication subsystem typically comprises in the<br>
radiotelephone 403:<br>
- a transmitter 406 including:<br>
- an encoder 407 for encoding a voice signal or other<br>
signal to be transmitted; and<br><br>
- a transmission circuit 408 for transmitting the encoded<br>
signal from the encoder 407 through an antenna such as<br>
409; and<br>
- a receiver 410 including:<br>
- a receiving circuit 411 for receiving a transmitted<br>
encoded voice signal or other signal usually through the<br>
same antenna 409; and<br>
- a decoder 412 for decoding the received encoded<br>
signal from the receiving circuit 411.<br>
The radiotelephone 403 further comprises other<br>
conventional radiotelephone circuits 413 to supply a voice signal or other<br>
signal to the encoder 407 and to process the voice signal or other signal<br>
from the decoder 412. These radiotelephone circuits 413 are well known<br>
to those of ordinary skill in the art and, accordingly, will not be further<br>
described in the present specification.<br>
Also, such a bidirectional wireless radio communication<br>
subsystem typically comprises in the base station 402:<br>
- a transmitter 414 including:<br>
- an encoder 415 for encoding the voice signal or other<br>
signal to be transmitted; and<br><br>
- a transmission circuit 416 for transmitting the encoded<br>
signal from the encoder 415 through an antenna such as<br>
417; and<br>
- a receiver 418 including:<br>
- a receiving circuit 419 for receiving a transmitted<br>
encoded voice signal or other signal through the same<br>
antenna 417 or through another different antenna (not<br>
shown); and<br>
- a decoder 420 for decoding the received encoded<br>
signal from the receiving circuit 419.<br>
The base station 402 further comprises, typically, a base<br>
station controller 421, along with its associated database 422, for<br>
controlling communication between the control terminal 405 and the<br>
transmitter 414 and receiver 418. The base station controller 421 will<br>
also control communication between the receiver 418 and the<br>
transmitter 414 in the case of communication between two<br>
radiotelephones such as 403 located in the same cell as base station<br>
402.<br>
As well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, encoding<br>
is required in order to reduce the bandwidth necessary to transmit a<br>
signal, for example a voice signal such as speech, across the<br>
bidirectional wireless radio communication subsystem, i.e., between a<br>
radiotelephone 403 and a base station 402.<br><br>
LP voice encoders (such as 415 and 407) typically<br>
operating at 13 kbits/second and below such as Code-Excited Linear<br>
Prediction (CELP) encoders typically use a LP synthesis filter to model<br>
the short-term spectral envelope of the speech signal. The LP<br>
information is transmitted, typically, every 10 or 20 ms to the decoder<br>
(such 420 and 412) and is extracted at the decoder end.<br>
The novel techniques disclosed in the present specification<br>
can be used with telephone-band signals including speech, with sound<br>
signals other than speech as well with other types of wideband signals.<br>
Figure 1 shows a general block diagram of a CELP-type<br>
speech encoding device 100 modified to better accommodate wideband<br>
signals. Wideband signals may comprise, amongst others, signals such<br>
as music and video signals.<br>
The sampled input speech signal 114 is divided into<br>
successive L-sample blocks called "frames". In each frame, different<br>
parameters representing the speech signal in the frame are computed,<br>
encoded, and transmitted. LP parameters representing the LP synthesis<br>
filter are usually computed once every frame. The frame is further<br>
divided into smaller blocks of N samples (blocks of length N), in which<br>
excitation parameters (pitch and innovation) are determined. In the<br>
CELP literature, these blocks of length N are called "subframes" and the<br>
N-sample signals in the subframes are referred to as N-dimensional<br>
vectors. In this preferred embodiment, the length N corresponds to 5 ms<br>
while the length L corresponds to 20 ms, which means that a frame<br>
contains four subframes (N=80 at the sampling rate of 16 kHz and 64<br>
after down-sampling to 12.8 kHz). Various N-dimensional vectors occur<br>
in the encoding procedure. A list of the vectors which appear in Figures<br><br>
1 and 2 as well as a list of transmitted parameters are given herein<br>
below:<br>

transmitted once per frame and the rest of the parameters are<br>
transmitted every subframe (four times per frame).<br>
ENCODER SIDE<br>
The sampled speech signal is encoded on a block by block<br>
basis by the encoding device 100 of Figure 1 which is broken down into<br>
eleven modules numbered from 101 to 111.<br>
The input speech signal is processed in the above<br>
mentioned L-sample blocks called frames.<br>
Referring to Figure 1, the sampled input speech signal 114<br>
is down-sampled in a down-sampling module 101. For example, the<br>
signal is down-sampled from 16 kHz down to 12.8 kHz, using techniques<br>
well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Down-sampling down to<br>
another frequency can of course be envisaged. Down-sampling<br>
increases the coding efficiency, since a smaller frequency bandwidth is<br>
encoded. This also reduces the algorithmic complexity since the number<br>
of samples in a frame is decreased. The use of down-sampling becomes<br><br>
significant when the bit rate is reduced below 16 kbit/s; down-sampling is<br>
not essential above 16 kbit/s.<br>
After down-sampling, the 320-sample frame of 20 ms is<br>
reduced to a 256-sample frame (down-sampling ratio of 4/5).<br>
The input frame is then supplied to the optional pre-<br>
processing block 102. Pre-processing block 102 may consist of a high-<br>
pass filter with a 50 Hz cut-off frequency. High-pass filter 102 removes<br>
the unwanted sound components below 50 Hz.<br>
The down-sampled pre-processed signal is denoted by<br>
Sp(n), n = 0, 1, 2, ...,L-1, where L is the length of the frame (256 at a<br>
sampling frequency of 12.8 kHz). In a preferred embodiment, the signal<br>
Sp(n) is preemphasized using a preemphasis filter 103 having the<br>
following transfer function:<br>
P(z) = 1-µz-1<br>
where µ is a preemphasis factor with a value located between 0 and 1 (a<br>
typical value is µ = 0.7), and z represents the variable of the polynomial<br>
P(z). A higher-order filter could also be used. It should be pointed out<br>
that high-pass filter 102 and preemphasis filter 103 can be interchanged<br>
to obtain more efficient fixed-point implementations.<br>
The function of the preemphasis filter 103 is to enhance<br>
the high frequency contents of the input signal. It also reduces the<br>
dynamic range of the input speech signal, which renders it more suitable<br><br>
for fixed-point implementation. Without preemphasis, LP analysis in<br>
fixed-point using single-precision arithmetic is difficult to implement.<br>
Preemphasis also plays an important role in achieving a<br>
proper overall perceptual weighting of the quantization error, which<br>
contributes to improve sound quality. This will be explained in more<br>
detail herein below.<br>
The output of the preemphasis filter 103 is denoted s(n).<br>
This signal is used for performing LP analysis in calculator module 104.<br>
LP analysis is a technique well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
In this preferred embodiment, the autocorrelation approach is used. In<br>
the autocorrelation approach, the signal s(n) is first windowed using a<br>
Hamming window (having usually a length of the order of 30-40 ms).<br>
The autocorrelations are computed from the windowed signal, and<br>
Levinson-Durbin recursion is used to compute LP filter coefficients, ai,<br>
where i=1,...,p, and where p is the LP order, which is typically 16 in<br>
wideband coding. The parameters aj are the coefficients of the transfer<br>
function of the LP filter, which is given by the following relation:<br><br>
LP analysis is performed in calculator module 104, which<br>
also performs the quantization and interpolation of the LP filter<br>
coefficients. The LP filter coefficients are first transformed into another<br>
equivalent domain more suitable for quantization and interpolation<br>
purposes. The line spectral pair (LSP) and immitance spectral pair (ISP)<br>
domains are two domains in which quantization and interpolation can be<br>
efficiently performed. The 16 LP filter coefficients, a,, can be quantized in<br><br>
the order of 30 to 50 bits using split or multi-stage quantization, or a<br>
combination thereof. The purpose of the interpolation is to enable<br>
updating the LP filter coefficients every subframe while transmitting them<br>
once every frame, which improves the encoder performance without<br>
increasing the bit rate. Quantization and interpolation of the LP filter<br>
coefficients are believed to be otherwise well known to those of ordinary<br>
skill in the art and, accordingly, will not be further described in the<br>
present specification.<br>
The following paragraphs will describe the rest of the<br>
coding operations performed on a subframe basis. In the following<br>
description, the filter A{z) denotes the unquantized interpolated LP filter<br>
of the subframe, and the filter A(z) denotes the quantized interpolated<br>
LP filter of the subframe.<br>
Perceptual Weighting:<br>
In analysis-by-synthesis encoders, the optimum pitch and<br>
innovation parameters are searched by minimizing the mean squared<br>
error between the input speech and the synthesized speech in a<br>
perceptually weighted domain. This is equivalent to minimizing the error<br>
between the weighted input speech and weighted synthesis speech.<br>
The weighted signal Sw(n) is computed in a perceptual<br>
weighting filter 105. Traditionally, the weighted signal sw(n) is computed<br>
by a weighting filter having a transfer function W(z) in the form:<br><br><br>
As well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, in former<br>
analysis-by-synthesis (AbS) encoders, analysis shows that the<br>
quantization error is weighted by a transfer function W-1(z), which is the<br>
inverse of the transfer function of the perceptual weighting filter 105.<br>
This result is well described by B.S. Atal and M.R. Schroeder in<br>
"Predictive coding of speech and subjective error criteria", IEEE<br>
Transaction ASSP, vol. 27, no. 3, pp. 247-254, June 1979. Transfer<br>
function W-1(z) exhibits some of the formant structure of the input<br>
speech signal. Thus, the masking property of the human ear is exploited<br>
by shaping the quantization error so that it has more energy in the<br>
formant regions where it will be masked by the strong signal energy<br>
present in these regions. The amount of weighting is controlled by the<br>
factors ?1 and ?2.<br>
The above traditional perceptual weighting filter 105 works<br>
well with telephone band signals. However, it was found that this<br>
traditional perceptual weighting filter 105 is not suitable for efficient<br>
perceptual weighting of wideband signals. It was also found that the<br>
traditional perceptual weighting filter 105 has inherent limitations in<br>
modelling the formant structure and the required spectral tilt<br>
concurrently. The spectral tilt is more pronounced in wideband signals<br>
due to the wide dynamic range between low and high frequencies. To<br>
solve this problem, it has been suggested to add a tilt filter into W(z) in<br>
order to control the tilt and formant weighting of the wideband input<br>
signal separately.<br>
A better solution to this problem is to introduce the<br>
preemphasis filter 103 at the input, compute the LP filter A(z) based on<br>
the preemphasized speech s(n), and use a modified filter W(z) by fixing<br>
its denominator.<br><br>
LP analysis is performed in module 104 on the<br>
preemphasized signal s(n) to obtain the LP filter A(z). Also, a new<br>
perceptual weighting filter 105 with fixed denominator is used. An<br>
example of transfer function for this perceptual weighting filter 104 is<br>
given by the following relation:<br><br>
A higher order can be used at the denominator. This<br>
structure substantially decouples the formant weighting from the tilt.<br>
Note that because A(z) is computed based on the<br>
preemphasized speech signal s(n), the tilt of the filter 1/A(z/?i) is less<br>
pronounced compared to the case when A(z) is computed based on the<br>
original speech. Since deemphasis is performed at the decoder end<br>
using a filter having the transfer function:<br><br>
the quantization error spectrum is shaped by a filter having a transfer<br>
function W-1(z)P-1(z). When ?1 is set equal to µ, which is typically the<br>
case, the spectrum of the quantization error is shaped by a filter whose<br>
transfer function is 1/A(z/?1), with A(z) computed based on the<br>
preemphasized speech signal. Subjective listening showed that this<br>
structure for achieving the error shaping by a combination of<br>
preemphasis and modified weighting filtering is very efficient for<br>
encoding wideband signals, in addition to the advantages of ease of<br>
fixed-point algorithmic implementation.<br><br>
Pitch Analysis:<br>
In order to simplify the pitch analysis, an open-loop pitch<br>
lag TOL is first estimated in the open-loop pitch search module 106 using<br>
the weighted speech signal sw(n). Then the closed-loop pitch analysis,<br>
which is performed in closed-loop pitch search module 107 on a<br>
subframe basis, is restricted around the open-loop pitch lag TOL which<br>
significantly reduces the search complexity of the LTP parameters T and<br>
b (pitch lag and pitch gain). Open-loop pitch analysis is usually<br>
performed in module 106 once every 10 ms (two subframes) using<br>
techniques well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
The target vector x for LTP (Long Term Prediction)<br>
analysis is first computed. This is usually done by subtracting the zero-<br>
input response s0 of weighted synthesis filter W(z)/A(z) from the<br>
weighted speech signal sw(n). This zero-input response so is calculated<br>
by a zero-input response calculator 108. More specifically, the target<br>
vector x is calculated using the following relation:<br><br>
where x is the N-dimensional target vector, sw is the weighted speech<br>
vector in the subframe, and so is the zero-input response of filter<br>
W(z)/Â(z) which is the output of the combined filter W(z)/Â(z) due to its<br>
initial states. The zero-input response calculator 108 is responsive to the<br>
quantized interpolated LP filter Â(z) from the LP analysis, quantization<br>
and interpolation calculator 104 and to the initial states of the weighted<br>
synthesis filter W(z)/Â(z) stored in memory module 111 to calculate the<br>
zero-input response s0 (that part of the response due to the initial states<br>
as determined by setting the inputs equal to zero) of filter W(z)/Â(z). This<br><br>
operation is well known to those of ordinary skill in the art and,<br>
accordingly, will not be further described.<br>
Of course, alternative but mathematically equivalent<br>
approaches can be used to compute the target vector x.<br>
A N-dimensional impulse response vector h of the<br>
weighted synthesis filter W(z)/Â(z) is computed in the impulse response<br>
generator 109 using the LP filter coefficients A(z) and A(z) from module<br>
104. Again, this operation is well known to those of ordinary skill in the<br>
art and, accordingly, will not be further described in the present<br>
specification.<br>
The closed-loop pitch (or pitch codebook) parameters b, T<br>
and; are computed in the closed-loop pitch search module 107, which<br>
uses the target vector x, the impulse response vector h and the open-<br>
loop pitch lag TOL as inputs. Traditionally, the pitch prediction has been<br>
represented by a pitch filter having the following transfer function:<br><br>
where b is the pitch gain and T is the pitch delay or lag. In this case, the<br>
pitch contribution to the excitation signal u(n) is given by bu(n-T), where<br>
the total excitation is given by<br><br><br>
with g being the innovative codebook gain and ck(n) the innovative<br>
codevector at index k.<br>
This representation has limitations if the pitch lag T is<br>
shorter than the subframe length N. In another representation, the pitch<br>
contribution can be seen as a pitch codebook containing the past<br>
excitation signal. Generally, each vector in the pitch codebook is a shift-<br>
by-one version of the previous vector (discarding one sample and<br>
adding a new sample). For pitch lags T&gt;N, the pitch codebook is<br>
equivalent to the filter structure (1/(1-bz-T), and a pitch codebook vector<br>
VT(n) at pitch lag T is given by<br><br>
For pitch lags T shorter than N, a vector VT(n) is built by<br>
repeating the available samples from the past excitation until the vector<br>
is completed (this is not equivalent to the filter structure).<br>
In recent encoders, a higher pitch resolution is used which<br>
significantly improves the quality of voiced sound segments. This is<br>
achieved by oversampling the past excitation signal using polyphase<br>
interpolation filters. In this case, the vector vT(n) usually corresponds to<br>
an interpolated version of the past excitation, with pitch lag T being a<br>
non-integer delay (e.g. 50.25).<br>
The pitch search consists of finding the best pitch lag T<br>
and gain b that minimize the mean squared weighted error E between<br>
the target vector x and the scaled filtered past excitation. Error E being<br>
expressed as:<br><br><br>
where yT is the filtered pitch codebook vector at pitch lag T:<br><br>
It can be shown that the error E is minimized by<br>
maximizing the search criterion<br><br>
where t denotes vector transpose.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, a 1/3 subsample pitch<br>
resolution is used, and the pitch (pitch codebook) search is composed of<br>
three stages.<br>
In the first stage, an open-loop pitch lag TOL is estimated in<br>
open-loop pitch search module 106 in response to the weighted speech<br>
signal sw(n). As indicated in the foregoing description, this open-loop<br>
pitch analysis is usually performed once every 10 ms (two subframes)<br>
using techniques well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
In the second stage, the search criterion C is searched in<br>
the closed-loop pitch search module 107 for integer pitch lags around<br>
the estimated open-loop pitch lag TOL (usually ±5), which significantly<br>
simplifies the search procedure. The following description proposes a<br><br>
simple procedure for updating the filtered codevector yT without the<br>
need to compute the convolution for every pitch lag.<br>
Once an optimum integer pitch lag is found in the second<br>
stage, a third stage of the search (module 107) tests the fractions<br>
around that optimum integer pitch lag.<br>
When the pitch predictor is represented by a filter of the<br>
form 1/(1-bz-T), which is a valid assumption for pitch lags T&gt;N, the<br>
spectrum of the pitch filter exhibits a harmonic structure over the entire<br>
frequency range, with a harmonic frequency related to 1/T. In case of<br>
wideband signals, this structure is not very efficient since the harmonic<br>
structure in wideband signals does not cover the entire extended<br>
spectrum. The harmonic structure exists only up to a certain frequency,<br>
depending on the speech segment. Thus, in order to achieve efficient<br>
representation of the pitch contribution in voiced segments of wideband<br>
speech, the pitch prediction filter needs to have the flexibility of varying<br>
the amount of periodicity over the wideband spectrum.<br>
An improved method capable of achieving efficient<br>
modeling of the harmonic structure of the speech spectrum of wideband<br>
signals is disclosed in the present specification, whereby several forms<br>
of low pass filters are applied to the past excitation and the low pass<br>
filter with higher prediction gain is selected.<br>
When subsample pitch resolution is used, the low pass<br>
filters can be incorporated into the interpolation filters used to obtain the<br>
higher pitch resolution. In this case, the third stage of the pitch search, in<br>
which the fractions around the chosen integer pitch lag are tested, is<br>
repeated for the several interpolation filters having different low-pass<br><br>
characteristics and the fraction and filter index which maximize the<br>
search criterion C are selected.<br>
A simpler approach is to complete the search in the three<br>
stages described above to determine the optimum fractional pitch lag<br>
using only one interpolation filter with a certain frequency response, and<br>
select the optimum low-pass filter shape at the end by applying the<br>
different predetermined low-pass filters to the chosen pitch codebook<br>
vector vT and select the low-pass filter which minimizes the pitch<br>
prediction error. This approach is discussed in detail below.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates a schematic block diagram of a<br>
preferred embodiment of the proposed, latter approach.<br>
In memory module 303, the past excitation signal u(n),<br>
n
the target vector x, to the open-loop pitch lag TOL and to the past<br>
excitation signal u(n), n
codebook (pitch codebook) search minimizing the above-defined search<br>
criterion C. From the result of the search conducted in module 301,<br>
module 302 generates the optimum pitch codebook vector VT- Note that<br>
since a sub-sample pitch resolution is used (fractional pitch), the past<br>
excitation signal u(n), n
vT corresponds to the interpolated past excitation signal. In this preferred<br>
embodiment, the interpolation filter (in module 301, but not shown) has a<br>
low-pass filter characteristic removing the frequency contents above<br>
7000 Hz.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, K filter characteristics are<br>
used; these filter characteristics could be low-pass or band-pass filter<br><br>
characteristics. Once the optimum codevector vT is determined and<br>
supplied by the pitch codevector generator 302, K filtered versions of vT<br>
are computed respectively using K different frequency shaping filters<br>
such as 305(j), where j=1, 2, ... , K. These filtered versions are denoted<br>
vf(j) , where j=1, 2, ... , K. The different vectors vf(j) are convolved in<br>
respective modules 304(j), where j=0, 1, 2, ... , K, with the impulse<br>
response h to obtain the vectors y(j), where j=0, 1, 2, ... , K. To calculate<br>
the mean squared pitch prediction error for each vector y(j), the value y(j)<br>
is multiplied by the gain b by means of a corresponding amplifier 3O7(j)<br>
and the value by(j) is subtracted from the target vector x by means of a<br>
corresponding subtractor 308(j). Selector 309 selects the frequency<br>
shaping filter 305(j) which minimizes the mean squared pitch prediction<br>
error<br><br>
To calculate the mean squared pitch prediction error e(j) for<br>
each value of y(j), the value y(j) is multiplied by the gain b by means of a<br>
corresponding amplifier 307(j) and the value b(j)y(j) is subtracted from the<br>
target vector x by means of subtractors 308(j). Each gain b(j) is calculated<br>
in a corresponging gain calculator 306(j) in association with the<br>
frequency shaping filter at index j, using the following relationship:<br><br>
In selector 309, the parameters b, T, and j are chosen<br>
based on vT or vf(j) which minimizes the mean squared pitch prediction<br>
error e.<br><br>
Referring back to Figure 1, the pitch codebook index T is<br>
encoded and transmitted to multiplexer 112. The pitch gain b is<br>
quantized and transmitted to multiplexer 112. With this new approach,<br>
extra information is needed to encode the index j of the selected<br>
frequency shaping filter in multiplexer 112. For example, if three filters<br>
are used (j=0, 1, 2, 3), then two bits are needed to represent this<br>
information. The filter index information j can also be encoded jointly with<br>
the pitch gain b.<br>
Innovative codebook:<br>
Once the pitch, or LTP (Long Term Prediction) parameters<br>
b, 7, and j are determined, the next step is to search for the optimum<br>
innovative excitation by means of search module 110 of Figure 1. First,<br>
the target vector x is updated by subtracting the LTP contribution:<br><br>
where b is the pitch gain and yT is the filtered pitch codebook vector (the<br>
past excitation at delay T filtered with the selected low pass filter and<br>
convolved with the inpulse response h as described with reference to<br>
Figure 3).<br>
The search procedure in CELP is performed by finding the<br>
optimum excitation codevector Ck and gain g which minimize the mean-<br>
squared error between the target vector and the scaled filtered<br>
codevector<br><br><br>
where H is a lower triangular convolution matrix derived from the<br>
impulse response vector h.<br>
It is worth noting that the used innovation codebook is a<br>
dynamic codebook consisting of an algebraic codebook followed by an<br>
adaptive prefilter F(z) which enhances special spectral components in<br>
order to improve the synthesis speech quality, according to US Patent<br>
No. 5,444,816. Different methods can be used to design this prefilter.<br>
Here, a design relevant to wideband signals is used whereby F(z)<br>
consists of two parts: a periodicity enhancement part 1/(1-0.85z-T) and a<br>
tilt part (1 - ?1 z-1), where T is the integer part of the pitch lag and ?1 is<br>
related to the voicing of the previous subframe and is bounded by<br>
[0.0,0.5]. Note that prior to the codebook search, the impulse response<br>
h(n) must include the prefilter F(z). That is,<br><br>
Preferably, the innovative codebook search is performed in<br>
module 110 by means of an algebraic codebook as described in US<br>
Patents Nos: 5,444,816 (Adoul et al.) issued on August 22, 1995;<br>
5,699,482 granted to Adoul et al., on December 17, 1997; 5,754,976<br>
granted to Adoul et al., on May 19, 1998; and 5,701,392 (Adoul et al.)<br>
dated December 23, 1997.<br>
There are many ways to design an algebraic codebook. In<br>
the presently described embodiment, the algebraic codebook is<br>
composed of codevectors having Np non-zero-amplitude pulses (or non-<br>
zero pulses for short) p,.<br><br>
Let us call m1 and ?i the position and amplitude of the jth<br>
non-zero pulse, respectively. We will assume that the amplitude ?i is<br>
known either because the jth amplitude is fixed or because there exists<br>
some method for selecting ?i prior to the codebook search. The<br>
preselection of the pulse amplitudes is performed according to the<br>
method as described in the above mentioned US Patent No. 5,754,976.<br>
Let us call "track i", denoted Ti the set of positions pi that<br>
the ith non-zero pulse can occupy between 0 and N-1. Some typical sets<br>
of tracks are given below assuming N=64.<br>
Several design examples have been introduced in US<br>
Patent No. 5,444,816 and referred to as "Interleaved Single Pulse<br>
Permutations" (ISPP). These examples were based on a codevector<br>
length of N=40 samples.<br>
Here we give new design examples based on a codevector<br>
length of N=64 and on an "Interleaved Single-Pulse Permutations"<br>
structure ISPP(64,4) given in Table 1.<br><br>
Table 1: ISPP(64,4) design.<br><br>
In the ISPP(64,4) design, a set of 64 positions is<br>
partitioned in 4 interleaved tracks of 60/4 = 16 valid positions each. Four<br>
bits are required to specify the 16 = 24 valid positions of a given non-<br>
zero pulse. There are many ways to derive a codebook structure and<br>
this ISPP design to accommodate particular requirements in terms of<br>
number of pulses or coding bits. Several codebooks can be designed<br>
based on this structure by varying the number of non-zero pulses that<br>
can be placed in each track.<br>
If a single signed non-zero pulse is placed in each track,<br>
the pulse position is encoded with 4 bits and its sign (if we consider that<br>
each non-zero pulse can be either positive or negative) is encoded with<br>
1 bit. Therefore a total of 4x(4+1) = 20 coding bits are required to specify<br>
pulse positions and signs for this particular algebraic codebook<br>
structure.<br>
If two signed non-zero pulses are placed in each track, the<br>
two pulse positions are encoded with 8 bits and their corresponding<br>
signs can be encoded with only 1 bit by exploiting the pulse ordering<br>
(this will be detailed later in the present specification). Therefore a total<br>
of 4x(4+4+1) = 36 coding bits are required to specify pulse positions and<br>
signs for this particular algebraic codebook structure.<br>
Other codebook structures can be designed by placing 3,<br>
4, 5, or 6 non-zero pulses in each track. Methods for efficiently coding<br>
the pulse positions and signs in such structures will be disclosed later.<br>
Further, other codebooks can be designed by placing<br>
unequal number of non-zero pulses in different tracks, or by ignoring<br>
certain tracks or by joining certain tracks. For example, a codebook can<br><br>
be designed by placing 3 non-zero pulses in tracks To and T2, and 2<br>
non-zero pulses in tracks T1 and T3 (13+9+13+9 = 42 bit codebook).<br>
Other codebooks can be designed by considering the union of tracks T2<br>
and T3 and placing non-zero pulses in tracks To , T1, and T2-T3.<br>
As can be seen a great variety of codebooks can be built<br>
around the general theme of ISPP designs.<br>
Efficient coding of pulse positions and signs (codebook indexing):<br>
Here, several cases for placing from 1 to 6 signed non-<br>
zero pulses per track will be considered, and methods for efficiently<br>
jointly coding pulse positions and signs in a given track are disclosed.<br>
First we will give examples of coding 1 non-zero pulse and<br>
2 non-zero pulses per track. Coding 1 signed non-zero pulse per track is<br>
straightforward and coding 2 signed non-zero pulses per track has been<br>
described in the literature, in the EFR speech coding standard (Global<br>
System for Mobile Communications, GSM 06.60, "Digital cellular<br>
telecommunications system; Enhanced Full Rate (EFR) speech<br>
transcoding," European Telecommunication Standard Institute, 1996).<br>
After having presented a method for encoding 2 signed<br>
non-zero pulses, methods for efficiently coding 3, 4, 5, and 6 signed<br>
non-zero pulses per track will be disclosed.<br>
Coding 1 signed pulse per track<br><br>
In a track of length K, one signed non-zero pulse requires<br>
1 bit for the sign and log2(K) bits for the position. We will consider here<br>
the special case where K=2M, which means that M bits are needed to<br>
encode the pulse position. Thus a total of M+1 bits are needed for one<br>
signed non-zero pulse in a track of length K=2M. In this preferred<br>
embodiment, the bit representing the sign (sign index) is set to 0 if the<br>
non-zero pulse is positive and to 1 if the non-zero pulse is negative. Of<br>
course the inverse notation can also be used.<br>
The position index of a pulse in a certain track is given by<br>
the pulse position in the subframe divided (integer division) by the pulse<br>
spacing in the track. The track index is found by the remainder of this<br>
integer division. Taking the example ISPP(64,4) of Table 1, the<br>
subframe size is 64 (0-63) and the pulse spacing is 4. A pulse at<br>
subframe position 25 has a position index of 25 DIV 4 = 6 and track<br>
index of 25 MOD 4=1, where DIV denotes integer division and MOD<br>
denotes the division remainder. Similarly, a pulse at subframe position of<br>
40 has a position index 10 and track index 0.<br>
The index of one signed non-zero pulse with position index<br>
p and sign index s and in a track of length 2M is given by<br><br>
For the case of K=16 (M=4 bits), the 5-bit index of the<br>
signed pulse is represented in the table below:<br><br><br>
The procedure code_1pulse(p, s, M) shows how to encode<br>
a pulse at a position index p and sign index s in a track of length 2M.<br><br>
Procedure 1: Coding 1 signed non-zero pulse in a track of<br>
length K=2M using M+1 bits.<br>
Coding 2 signed pulses per track<br>
In case of two non-zero pulses per track of K=2M potential<br>
positions, each pulse needs 1 bit for the sign and M bits for the position,<br>
which gives a total of 2M+2 bits. However, some redundancy exists due<br>
to the unimportance of the pulse ordering. For example, placing the first<br>
pulse at position p and the second pulse at position q is equivalent to<br>
placing the first pulse at position q and the second pulse at position p.<br>
One bit can be saved by encoding only one sign and deducing the<br>
second sign from the ordering of the positions in the index. In this<br>
preferred embodiment, the index is given by<br><br><br>
where s is the sign index of the non-zero pulse at position index p0.<br>
At the encoder, if the two signs are equal then the<br>
smaller position is set to p0 and the larger position is set to p1. On the<br>
other hand, if the two signs are not equal then the larger position is set<br>
to p0 and the smaller position is set to p1.<br>
At the decoder, the sign of the non-zero pulse at<br>
position p0 is readily available. The second sign is deduced from the<br>
pulse ordering. If the position p1 is smaller than position p0 then the sign<br>
of the non-zero pulse at position p1 is opposite to the sign of the non-<br>
zero pulse at position p0. If the position p1 is larger than position p0 then<br>
the sign of the non-zero pulse at position p1 is the same as the sign of<br>
the non-zero pulse at position p0.<br>
In this preferred embodiment, the ordering of the bits in the<br>
index is shown below, s corresponds to the sign of non-zero pulse p0.<br><br>
The procedure for encoding two non-zero pulses with<br>
position indices p0 and p1 and sign indices ?0 and ?1 is shown in Figure<br>
5. This is explained further in Procedure 2 below.<br><br><br>
Procedure 2: Coding 2 signed non-zero pulses in a track of<br>
length K=2M using 2M+1 bits.<br>
Coding 3 signed pulses per track<br>
In case of three non-zero pulses per track, similar logic can<br>
be used as the case of two non-zero pulses. For a track with 2M<br>
positions, 3M+1 bits are needed instead of 3M+3 bits. A simple way of<br>
indexing the non-zero pulses, which is disclosed in the present<br>
specification, is to divide the track positions in two halves (or sections)<br>
and identify a half that contains at least two non-zero pulses. The<br>
number of positions in each section is K/2 = 2M/2 = 2M-1 which can be<br>
represented with M-1 bits. The two non-zero pulses in the section<br><br>
containing at least two non-zero pulses are encoded with the procedure<br>
code_2pulse([p0 P1], [so s1], M-1) which requires 2(M-1)+1 bits and the<br>
remaining pulse which can be anywhere in the track (in either section) is<br>
encoded with the procedure code_1pulse(p, s, M) which requires M+1<br>
bits. Finally, the index of the section that contains the two non-zero<br>
pulses is encoded with 1 bit. Thus the total number of required bits is<br>
2(M-1)+1 +M+1 + 1 = 3M+1.<br>
A simple way of checking if two non-zero pulses are<br>
positioned in the same half of the track is done by checking whether the<br>
most significant bits (MSB) of their position indices are equal or not. This<br>
can be simply done by the Exclusive OR logical operation which gives 0<br>
if the MSBs are equal and 1 if not. Note that MSB=0 means that the<br>
position belongs to the lower half of the track (0 - (K/2-1)) and MSB=1<br>
means it belongs to the upper half (K/2 - (K-1)). If the two non-zero<br>
pulses belong to the upper half, they need to be shifted to the range (0 -<br>
(K/2-1)) before encoding them using 2(M-1)+1 bits. This can be done by<br>
masking the M-1 least significant bits (LSB) with a mask consisting of M-<br>
1 ones (1"s) (which corresponds to the number 2M-1 -1).<br>
The procedure for encoding 3 pulses at position indices p0,<br>
P1, and p2 and sign indices ?0, ?1, and ?2 is described in the procedure<br>
below.<br><br><br>
End<br>
Procedure 3: Coding 3 signed pulses in a track of length<br>
K=2M using 3M+1 bits.<br><br>
The table below shows the distribution of the bits in the 13-<br>
bit index according to this preferred embodiment for the case of M=4<br>
(K=16).<br><br>
Coding 4 signed pulses per track<br>
The 4 signed non-zero pulses in a track of length K=2M can<br>
be encoded using 4M bits.<br>
Similar to the case of 3 pulses, the K positions in the track<br>
are divided into 2 sections (two halves) where each section contains K/2<br>
pulse positions. Here we denote the sections as Section A with positions<br>
0 to K/2-1 and Section B with positions K/2 to K-1. Each section can<br>
contain from 0 to 4 non-zero pulses. The table below shows the 5 cases<br>
representing the possible number of pulses in each sections:<br><br><br>
In cases 0 or 4, the 4 pulses in a section of length K/2=2M-1<br>
can be encoded using 4(M-1)+1=4M-3 bits (this will be explained later<br>
on).<br>
In cases 1 or 3, the 1 pulse in a section of length K/2=2M-1<br>
can be encoded with M-1+1 = M bits and the 3 pulses in the other<br>
section can be encoded with 3(M-1)+1 = 3M-2 bits. This gives a total of<br>
M+3M-2 = 4M-2 bits.<br>
In case 2, the pulses in a section of length K/2=2M-1 can be<br>
encoded with 2(M-1)+1 = 2M-1 bits. Thus for both sections, 2(2M-1) =<br>
4M-2 bits are required.<br>
Now the case index can be encoded with 2 bits (4 possible<br>
cases) assuming cases 0 and 4 are combined. Then for cases 1, 2, or 3,<br>
the number of needed bits is 4M-2. This gives a total of 4M-2 + 2 = 4M<br>
bits. For cases 0 or 4, 1 bit is needed for identifying either case, and 4M-<br>
3 bits are needed for encoding the 4 pulses in the section. Adding the 2<br>
bits needed for the general case, this gives a total of 1+4M-3+2= 4M<br>
bits.<br>
Thus, as can be seen from the description above, the 4<br>
pulses can be encoded with a total of 4M bits.<br>
The procedure of encoding 4 signed non-zero pulses in a<br>
track of length K=2M using 4M bits is shown in Procedure 4 below.<br><br>
The 4 tables below show the distribution of bits in the index<br>
for the different cases described above according to the preferred<br>
embodiment where M=4 (K=16). Encoding 4 signed pulses per track<br>
requires 16 bits in this case.<br>
Cases 0 or 4<br><br>
Cases 1<br><br>
Cases 2<br><br>
Cases 3<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Procedure 4: Coding 4 signed non-zero pulses in a track of<br>
length K=2M using 4M bits.<br>
Note that for the cases 0 or 1, where the 4 non-zero pulses<br>
are in the same section, 4(M-1)+1 = 4M-3 bits are needed. This is done<br>
using a simple method for encoding 4 non-zero pulses in a Section of<br>
length K/2=2M-1 bits. This is done by further dividing the section into 2<br>
subsections of length K/4=2M-2; identifying a subsection that contains at<br>
least 2 non-zero pulses; coding the 2 non-zero pulses in that subsection<br>
using 2(M-2)+1=2M-3 bits; coding the index of the subsection that<br>
contains at least 2 non-zero pulses using 1 bit; and coding the remaining<br>
2 non-zero pulses, assuming that they can be anywhere in the section,<br>
using 2(M-1)+1=2M-1 bits. This gives a total of (2M-3)+(1)+(2M-1) = 4M-<br>
3 bits.<br>
Encoding 4 signed non-zero pulses in a Section of length<br>
K/2=2M-1 using 4M-3 bits is shown in Procedure 4_Section.<br><br><br>
Procedure 4_Section: Coding 4 signed pulses in a Section<br>
of length K/2=2M-1 using 4M-3 bits.<br>
Coding 5 signed pulses per track<br><br>
The 5 signed non-zero pulses in a track of length K=2M can<br>
be encoded using 5M bits.<br>
Similar to the case of 4 non-zero pulses, the K positions in<br>
the track are divided into 2 sections (two halves) where each section<br>
contains K/2 positions. Here we denote the sections as Section A with<br>
positions 0 to K/2-1 and Section B with positions K/2 to K-1. Each<br>
section can contain from 0 to 5 pulses. The table below shows the 6<br>
cases representing the possible number of pulses in each sections:<br><br>
In case 0, 1, and 2, there are at least 3 non-zero pulses in<br>
Section B. On the other hand, in cases 3, 4, and 5, there are at least 3<br>
pulses in Section A. Thus, a simple approach to encode the 5 non-zero<br>
pulses is to encode the 3 non-zero pulses in the same section using<br>
Procedure 3 which requires 3(M-1)+1= 3M-2 bits, and to encode the<br>
remaining 2 pulses using Procedure 2 which requires 2M+1 bits. This<br>
gives 5M-1 bits. An extra bits is needed to identify the section that<br><br>
contains at least 3 non-zero pulses (cases (0,1,2) or cases (3,4,5)). Thus<br>
a total of 5M bits are needed to encode the 5 signed non-zero pulses.<br>
The procedure of encoding 5 signed pulses in a track of<br>
length K=2M using 5M bits is shown in Procedure 5 below.<br>
The 2 tables below show the distribution of bits in the index<br>
for the different cases described above according to the preferred<br>
embodiment where M=4 (K=16). Encoding 5 signed non-zero pulses per<br>
track requires 20 bits in this case.<br>
Cases 0, 1, and 2<br><br>
Cases 3, 4, and 5<br><br><br><br>
Procedure 5: Coding 5 signed pulses in a track of length<br>
K=2M using 5M bits.<br><br>
Coding 6 signed pulses per track<br>
The 6 signed pulses in a track of length K=2M are encoded<br>
in this preferred embodiment using 6M-2 bits.<br>
Similar to the case of 5 pulses, the K positions in the track<br>
are divided into 2 sections (two halves) where each section contains K/2<br>
positions. Here we denote the sections as Section A with positions 0 to<br>
K/2-1 and Section B with positions K/2 to K-1. Each section can contain<br>
from 0 to 6 pulses. The table below shows the 7 cases representing the<br>
possible number of pulses in each sections:<br><br>
Note that cases 0 and 6 are similar except that the 6 non-<br>
zero pulses are in different sections. Similarly, the difference between<br>
cases 1 and 5 as well as cases 2 and 4 is the section that contains more<br>
pulses. Therefore these cases can be coupled and an extra bit can be<br>
assigned to identify the section that contains more pulses. Since these<br>
cases initially need 6M-5 bits, the coupled cases need 6M-4 bits taking<br>
into account the Section bit.<br><br>
Thus, we have now 4 states of coupled cases, with 2 extra<br>
bits needed for the state. This gives a total of 6M-4+2=6M-2 bits for the<br>
6 signed non-zero pulses. The coupled cases are shown in the table<br>
below.<br><br>
In cases 0 or 6, 1 bit is needed to identify the section which<br>
contains 6 non-zero pulses. 5 non-zero pulses in that section are<br>
encoded using Procedure 5 which needs 5(M-1) bits (since the pulses<br>
are confined to that section), and the remaining pulse is encoded using<br>
Procedure 1, which requires 1+(M-1) bits. Thus a total of 1+5(M-<br>
1)+M=6M-4 bits are needed for this coupled cases. Extra 2 bits are<br>
needed to encode the state of the coupled case, giving a total of 6M-2<br>
bits.<br>
In cases 1 or 5, 1 bit is needed to identify the section which<br>
contains 5 pulses. The 5 pulses in that section are encoded using<br>
Procedure 5 which needs 5(M-1) bits and the pulse in the other section<br>
is encoded using Procedure 1, which requires 1+(M-1) bits. Thus a total<br>
of 1+5(M-1)+M=6M-4 bits are needed for these coupled cases. Extra 2<br>
bits are needed to encode the state of the coupled cases, giving a total<br>
of 6M-2 bits.<br><br>
In cases 2 or 4, 1 bit is needed to identify the section which<br>
contains 4 non-zero pulses. The 4 pulses in that section are encoded<br>
using Procedure 4 which needs 4(M-1) bits and the 2 pulses in the other<br>
section are encoded using Procedure 2, which requires 1+2(M-1) bits.<br>
Thus a total of 1+4(M-1)+1+2(M-1)=6M-4 bits are needed for these<br>
coupled cases. Extra 2 bits are needed to encode the state of the case,<br>
giving a total of 6M-2 bits.<br>
In case 3, the 3 non-zero pulses in each section are<br>
encoded using Procedure 3 which requires 3(M-1)+1 bits in each<br>
Section. This gives 6M-4 bits for both sections. Extra 2 bits are needed<br>
to encode the state of the case, giving a total of 6M-2 bits.<br>
The procedure of encoding 6 signed non-zero pulses in a<br>
track of length K=2M using 6M-2 bits is shown in Procedure 6 below.<br>
The 2 tables below show the distribution of bits in the index<br>
for the different cases described above according to the preferred<br>
embodiment where M=4 (K=16). Encoding 6 signed non-zero pulses per<br>
track requires 22 bits in this case.<br>
Cases 0 and 6<br><br>
Cases 1 and 5<br><br><br>
Cases 2 and 4<br><br>
Case 3<br><br><br><br><br>
Procedure 6: Coding 6 signed pulses in a track of length<br>
K=2M using 6M-2 bits.<br>
Examples of codebook structures based on ISPP(64,4)<br>
Here, different codebook design examples are presented<br>
based on ISPP(64,4) design explained above. The track size is K=16<br>
requiring M-4 bits per track. The different design examples are obtained<br>
by changing the number of non-zero pulses per track. 8 possible designs<br>
are described below. Other codebooks structures can be easily obtained<br>
by choosing different combinations of non-zero pulses per track.<br>
Design 1: 1 pulse per track (20 bit codebook)<br>
In this example, each non-zero pulse requires (4+1) bits<br>
(Procedure 1) giving a total of 20 bits for the 4 pulses in the 4 tracks.<br>
Design 2: 2 pulses per track (36 bit codebook)<br>
In this example, the two non-zero pulses in each track<br>
require (4+4+1)=9 bits (Procedure 2) giving a total of 36 bits for the 8<br>
non-zero pulses in the 4 tracks.<br>
Design 3: 3 pulses per track (52 bit codebook)<br>
In this example, the 3 non-zero pulses in each track<br>
require (3x4+1)=13 bits (Procedure 3) giving a total of 52 bits for the 12<br>
non-zero pulses in the 4 tracks.<br><br>
Design 4: 4 pulses per track (64 bit codebook)<br>
In this example, the 4 non-zero pulses in each track<br>
require (4x4)=16 bits (Procedure 4) giving a total of 64 bits for the 16<br>
pulses in the 4 tracks.<br>
Design 5: 5 pulse per track (80 bit codebook)<br>
In this example, the 5 non-zero pulses in each track<br>
require (5x4)=20 bits (Procedure 5) giving a total of 80 bits for the 20<br>
non-zero pulses in the 4 tracks.<br>
Design 6: 6 pulse per track (88 bit codebook)<br>
In this example, the 6 non-zero pulses in each track<br>
require (6x4-2)=22 bits (Procedure 6) giving a total of 88 bits for the 24 .<br>
non-zero pulses in the 4 tracks.<br>
Design 7: 3 pulses in tracks To and T2 and 2 pulses in tracks T1 and T3<br>
(44 bit codebook)<br>
In this example, the 3 non-zero pulses tracks To and T2<br>
require (3x4+1)=13 bits (Procedure 3) per track and the 2 non-zero<br>
pulses in tracks T1 and T3 require (1+4+4)=9 bits (Procedure 2) per<br>
track. This gives a total of (13+9+13+9)=44 bits for the 10 non-zero<br>
pulses in the 4 tracks.<br>
Design 8: 5 pulses in tracks To and T2 and 4 pulses in tracks T1 and T3<br>
(72 bit codebook)<br><br>
In this example, the 5 non-zero pulses tracks To and T2<br>
require (5x4)=20 bits (Procedure 5) per track and the 4 pulses in tracks<br>
T1 and T3 require (4x4)=16 bits (Procedure 4) per track. This give a total<br>
of (20+16+20+16)=72 bits for the 18 non-zero pulses in the 4 tracks.<br>
Codebook search:<br>
In this preferred embodiment, a special method for<br>
performing depth-first search, described in US patent 5,701,392, is used<br>
whereby the memory requirements for storing the elements of the matrix<br>
HtH (which will be defined hereinafter) are significantly reduced. This<br>
matrix contains the autocorreltions of the impulse response h(n) and it is<br>
needed for performing the search procedure. In this preferred<br>
embodiment, only a part of this matrix is computed and stored and the<br>
other part is computed online within the search procedure.<br>
The algebraic codebook is searched by finding the<br>
optimum excitation codevector ck and gain g which minimize the mean-<br>
squared error between the target vector and the scaled filtered<br>
codevector<br><br>
where H is a lower triangular convolution matrix derived from the<br>
impulse response vector h. The matrix H is defined as the lower<br>
triangular Toeplitz convolution matrix with diagonal h(0) and lower<br>
diagonals h(1),...,h(N-1).<br><br>
It can be shown that the mean-squared weighted error E<br>
can be minimized by maximizing the search criterion<br><br>
where d - Htx2 is the correlation between the target signal x2(n) and the<br>
impulse response h(n) (also known as the backward filtered target<br>
vector), and 0=HtH is the matrix of correlations of h(n).<br>
The elements cf the vector d are computed by<br><br>
and the elements of the symmetric matrix are computed by<br><br>
The vector d and the matrix 0 can be computed prior to<br>
the codebook search.<br>
The algebraic structure of the codebooks allows for very<br>
fast search procedures since the innovation vector ck contains only a<br>
few non-zero pulses. The correlation in the numerator of the search<br>
criterion Qk is given by<br><br><br>
where mi is the position of the ith pulse, ?i is its amplitude, and Np is the<br>
number of pulses. The energy in the denominator of the search criterion<br>
Qk is given by<br><br>
Tc simplify the search procedure, the pulse amplitudes are<br>
predetermined by quantizing a certain reference signal b(n). Several<br>
methods can be used to define this reference signal. In this preferred<br>
embodiment, b(n) is given by<br><br>
where Ed - d"d is the energy of the signal d(n) and Er = r"LTPrLTP is the<br>
energy of the signal rLTP(n) which is the residual signal after long term<br>
prediction. The scaling factor ? controls the amount of dependence of<br>
the reference signal on d(n).<br>
In the signal-selected pulse amplitude approach disclosed<br>
in US Patent 5,754,976 the sign of a pulse at position / is set equal to the<br>
sign of the reference signal at that position. To simplify the search the<br>
signal d(n) and matrix are modified to incorporate the pre-selected<br>
signs.<br><br>
Let Sb(n) denote the vector containing the signs of b(n).<br>
The modified signal d"(n) is given by<br><br>
and the modified autocorrelation matrix " is given by<br><br>
The correlation at the numerator of the search criterion Qk<br>
is now given by<br><br>
and the energy at the denominator of the search criterion Qk is given by<br><br>
The goal of the search now is to determine the codevector<br>
with the best set of Np pulse positions assuming amplitudes of the<br>
pulses have been selected as described above. The basic selection<br>
criterion is the maximization of the above mentioned ratio Qk.<br>
According to US Patent 5,701,392, in order to reduce the<br>
search complexity, the pulse positions are determined Nm pulses at a<br>
time. More precisely, the Np available pulses are partitioned into M non-<br><br>
empty subsets of Nm pulses respectively such that N1+N2...+Nm...+NM =<br>
Np. A particular choice of positions for the first J = N1+N2...+Nm-1 pulses<br>
considered is called a level-m path or a path of length J. A basic criterion<br>
for a path of J pulse positions is the ratio Qk(J) when only the J relevant<br>
pulses are considered.<br>
The search begins with subset #1 and proceeds with<br>
subsequent subsets according to a tree structure whereby subset m is<br>
searched at the mth level of the tree.<br>
The purpose of the search at level 1 is to consider the N1<br>
pulses of subset #1 and their valid positions in order to determine one,<br>
or a number of, candidate path(s) of length N1 which are the tree nodes<br>
at level 1.<br>
The path at each terminating node of level m-1 is extended<br>
to length N1+N2...+Nm at level m by considering Nm new pulses and their<br>
valid positions. One, or a number of, candidate extended path(s) are<br>
determined to constitute level-m nodes.<br>
The best codevector corresponds to that path of length Np<br>
which maximizes a given criterion, for example criterion Qk(Np) with<br>
respect to all level-M nodes.<br>
In this preferred embodiment, 2 pulses are always<br>
considered at a time in the search procedure, that is, Nm=2. However,<br>
instead of assuming that the matrix is precomputed and stored, which<br>
requires a memory of NxN words (64x64= 4k words in this preferred<br>
embodiment), a memory-efficient approach is used which significantly<br><br>
reduces the memory requirement. In this new approach, the search<br>
procedure is performed in such a way that only a part of the needed<br>
elements of the correlation matrix are precomputed and stored. This part<br>
is related to the correlations of the impulse response corresponding to<br>
potential pulse positions in consecutive tracks, as well as the<br>
correlations corresponding to (j,j), j=0,...,N-1 (that is the elements of<br>
the main diagonal of matrix 0).<br>
As an example of memory saving, in this preferred<br>
embodiment, the subframe size is N=64, which means that the<br>
correlation matrix is of size 64x64=4096. Since the pulses are searched<br>
two pulses at time in consecutive tracks, namely tracks T0-T1, T1-T2, T2-<br>
T3, or T3-T0, the correlation elements needed are those corresponding to<br>
pulses in adjacent tracks. Since each tracks contains 16 potential<br>
positions, there exists 16x16=256 correlation elements corresponding to<br>
two adjacent tracks. Thus, with the memory-efficient approach, the<br>
elements needed are 4x256=1024 for the four possibilities of adjacent<br>
tracks (T0-T1, T1-T2, T2-T3, and T3-T0). In addition, 64 correlations in the<br>
diagonal of the matrix are needed. Giving a storage requirement of 1088<br>
instead of 4096 words.<br>
A special form of the depth-first tree search procedure is<br>
used in this preferred embodiment, in which two pulses in two<br>
consecutive tracks are searched at a time. In order to reduce complexity,<br>
a limited number of potential positions of the first pulse are tested.<br>
Further, for algebraic codebooks with a large number of pulses, some<br>
pulses in the higher levels of the search tree can be fixed.<br>
In order to guess intelligently which potential pulse<br>
positions are considered for the first pulse or in order to fix some pulse<br><br>
positions, a "pulse-position likelihood-estimate vector" b is used, which<br>
is based on speech-related signals. The pth component b(p) of this<br>
estimate vector b characterizes the probability of a pulse occupying<br>
position p (p = 0, 1, ... N-1) in the best codevector we are searching for.<br>
For a given track, the estimate vector b indicates the<br>
relative probability of each valid position. This property can be used<br>
advantageously as a selection criterion in the first few levels of the tree<br>
structure in place of the basic selection criterion Qk(j) which anyhow, in<br>
the first few levels operates on too few pulses to provide reliable<br>
performance in selecting valid positions.<br>
In this preferred embodiment, the estimate vector b is the<br>
same reference signal used in pre-selecting the pulse amplitudes<br>
described above. That is,<br><br>
where Ed =d"d is the energy of the signal d(n) and Er = r"LTPrLTP is the<br>
energy of the signal rLTP(n) which is the residual signal after long term<br>
prediction.<br>
Once the optimum excitation codevector ck and its gain g<br>
are chosen by module 110, the codebook index k and gain g are<br>
encoded and transmitted to multiplexer 112.<br><br>
Referring to Figure 1, the parameters b, T, j, Â(z), k and g<br>
are multiplexed through the multiplexer 112 before being transmitted<br>
through a communication channel.<br>
Memory update:<br>
In memory module 111 (Figure 1), the states of the<br>
weighted synthesis filter W(z)/Â(z) are updated by filtering the excitation<br>
signal u = gck + bvT through the weighted synthesis filter. After this<br>
filtering, the states of the filter are memorized and used in the next<br>
subframe as initial states for computing the zero-input response in<br>
calculator module 108.<br>
As in the case of the target vector x, other alternative but<br>
mathematically equivalent approaches well known to those of ordinary<br>
skill in the art can be used to update the filter states.<br>
DECODER SIDE<br>
The speech decoding device 200 of Figure 2 illustrates the<br>
various steps carried out between the digital input 222 (input stream to<br>
the demultiplexer 217) and the output sampled speech 223 (sout from the<br>
adder 221).<br>
Demultiplexer 217 extracts the synthesis model<br>
parameters from the binary information received from a digital input<br>
channel. From each received binary frame, the extracted parameters<br>
are:<br><br>
- the short-term prediction parameters (STP) A(z) on line 225<br>
(once per frame);<br>
- the long-term prediction (LTP) parameters T, b, and J (for each<br>
subframe); and<br>
- the innovation codebook index k and gain g (for each<br>
subframe).<br>
The current speech signal is synthesized based on these<br>
parameters as will be explained hereinbelow.<br>
The innovative codebook 218 is responsive to the index k<br>
to produce the innovation codevector ck, which is scaled by the decoded<br>
gain g through an amplifier 224. In the preferred embodiment, an<br>
innovative codebook 218 as described in the above mentioned US<br>
Patent Nos. 5,444,816; 5,699,482; 5,754,976; and 5,701,392 is used to<br>
represent the innovative codevector ck .<br>
The generated scaled codevector gck at the output of the<br>
amplifier 224 is processed through an innovation filter 205.<br>
Periodicity enhancement:<br>
The generated scaled codevector gck at the output of the<br>
amplifier 224 is also processed through a frequency-dependent pitch<br>
enhancer, namely the innovation filter 205.<br><br>
Enhancing the periodicity of the excitation signal u<br>
improves the quality in case of voiced segments. This was done in the<br>
past by filtering the innovation vector from the innovative codebook<br>
(fixed codebook) 218 through a filter in the form 1/(1-sbz-T) where s is a<br>
factor below 0.5 which controls the amount of introduced periodicity.<br>
This approach is less efficient in case of wideband signals since it<br>
introduces periodicity over the entire spectrum. A new alternative<br>
approach, which is part of the present invention, is disclosed whereby<br>
periodicity enhancement is achieved by filtering the innovative<br>
codevector ck from the innovative (fixed) codebook through an<br>
innovation filter 205 (F(z)) whose frequency response emphasizes the<br>
higher frequencies more than lower frequencies. The coefficients of F(z)<br>
are related to the amount of periodicity in the excitation signal u.<br>
Many methods known to those skilled in the art are<br>
available for obtaining valid periodicity coefficients. For example, the<br>
value of gain b provides an indication of periodicity. That is, if gain b is<br>
close to 1, the periodicity of the excitation signal u is high, and if gain b<br>
is less than 0.5, then periodicity is low.<br>
Another efficient way to derive the filter F(z) coefficients is<br>
to relate them to the amount of pitch contribution in the total excitation<br>
signal u. This results in a frequency response depending on the<br>
subframe periodicity, where higher frequencies are more strongly<br>
emphasized (stronger overall slope) for higher pitch gains. Innovation<br>
filter 205 has the effect of lowering the energy of the innovative<br>
codevector cK at low frequencies when the excitation signal u is more<br>
periodic, which enhances the periodicity of the excitation signal u at<br>
lower frequencies more than higher frequencies. Suggested forms for<br>
innovation filter 205 are<br><br><br>
where ? or ? are periodicity factors derived from the level of periodicity<br>
of the excitation signal u.<br>
The second three-term form of F(z) is used in a preferred<br>
embodiment. The periodicity factor ? is computed in the voicing factor<br>
generator 204. Several methods can be used to derive the periodicity<br>
factor a based on the periodicity of the excitation signal u. Two methods<br>
are presented below.<br>
Method 1:<br>
The ratio of pitch contribution to the total excitation signal u<br>
is first computed in voicing factor generator 204 by<br><br>
where vT is the pitch codebook vector, b is the pitch gain, and u is the<br>
excitation signal u given at the output of the adder 219 by<br><br>
Note that the term bvT has its source in the pitch codebook<br>
(pitch codebook) 201 in response to the pitch lag land the past value of<br>
u stored in memory 203. The pitch codevector VT from the pitch<br><br>
codebook 201 is then processed through a low-pass filter 202 whose<br>
cut-off frequency is adjusted by means of the index j from the<br>
demultiplexer 217. The resulting codevector vT is then multiplied by the<br>
gain b from the demultiplexer 217 through an amplifier 226 to obtain the<br>
signal bvT.<br>
The factor ? is calculated in voicing factor generator 204<br>
by<br><br>
where q is a factor which controls the amount of enhancement (q is set<br>
to 0.25 in this preferred embodiment).<br>
Method 2:<br>
Another method for calculating periodicity factor ? is<br>
discussed below.<br>
First, a voicing factor rv is computed in voicing factor<br>
generator 204 by<br><br>
where Ev is the energy of the scaled pitch codevector bvT and Ec is the<br>
energy of the scaled innovative codevector gck. That is<br><br><br>
and<br><br>
Note that the value of rv lies between -1 and 1 (1<br>
corresponds to purely voiced signals and -1 corresponds to purely<br>
unvoiced signals).<br>
In this preferred embodiment, the factor ? is then<br>
computed in voicing factor generator 204 by<br><br>
which corresponds to a value of 0 for purely unvoiced signals and 0.25<br>
for purely voiced signals.<br>
In the first, two-term form of F(z), the periodicity factor ?<br>
can be approximated by using ? = 2? in methods 1 and 2 above. In<br>
such a case, the periodicity factor ? is calculated as follows in method 1<br>
above:<br><br>
In method 2, the periodicity factor ? is calculated as<br>
follows;<br><br><br>
The enhanced signal cf is therefore computed by filtering<br>
the scaled innovative codevector gck through the innovation filter 205<br>
(F(z)).<br>
The enhanced excitation signal u" is computed by the<br>
adder 220 as:<br>
u" = Cf+ bvT<br>
Note that this process is not performed at the encoder 100.<br>
Thus, it is essential to update the content of the pitch codebook 201<br>
using the excitation signal u without enhancement to keep synchronism<br>
between the encoder 100 and decoder 200. Therefore, the excitation<br>
signal u is used to update the memory 203 of the pitch codebook 201<br>
and the enhanced excitation signal u" is used at the input of the LP<br>
synthesis filter 206.<br>
Synthesis and deemphasis<br>
The synthesized signal s" is computed by filtering the<br>
enhanced excitation signal u" through the LP synthesis filter 206 which<br>
has the form 1/Â(z), where Â(z) is the interpolated LP filter in the current<br>
subframe. As can be seen in Figure 2, the quantized LP coefficients<br>
A(z) on line 225 from demultiplexer 217 are supplied to the LP synthesis<br>
filter 206 to adjust the parameters of the LP synthesis filter 206<br>
accordingly. The deemphasis filter 207 is the inverse of the preemphasis<br>
filter 103 of Figure 1. The transfer function of the deemphasis filter 207 is<br>
given by<br><br><br>
where µ is a preemphasis factor with a value located between 0 and 1 (a<br>
typical value is µ = 0.7). A higher-order filter could also be used.<br>
The vector s" is filtered through the deemphasis filter D(z)<br>
(module 207) to obtain the vector sd, which is passed through the high-<br>
pass filter 208 to remove the unwanted frequencies below 50 Hz and<br>
further obtain sh.<br>
Oversampling and high-frequency regeneration<br>
The over-sampling module 209 conducts the inverse<br>
process of the down-sampling module 101 of Figure 1. In this preferred<br>
embodiment, oversampling converts from the 12.8 kHz sampling rate to<br>
the original 16 kHz sampling rate, using techniques well known to those<br>
of ordinary skill in the art. The oversampled synthesis signal is denoted<br>
?. Signal s is also referred to as the synthesized wideband intermediate<br>
signal.<br>
The oversampled synthesis signal ? does not contain the<br>
higher frequency components which were lost by the downsampling<br>
process (module 101 of Figure 1) at the encoder 100. This gives a low-<br>
pass perception to the synthesized speech signal. To restore the full<br>
band of the original signal, a high frequency generation procedure is<br>
disclosed. This procedure is performed in modules 210 to 216, and<br>
adder 221, and requires input from voicing factor generator 204 (Figure<br>
2).<br><br>
In this new approach, the high frequency contents are<br>
generated by filling the upper part of the spectrum with a white noise<br>
properly scaled in the excitation domain, then converted to the speech<br>
domain, preferably by shaping it with the same LP synthesis filter used<br>
for synthesizing the down-sampled signal ?.<br>
The high frequency generation procedure in accordance<br>
with the present invention is described hereinbelow.<br>
The random noise generator 213 generates a white noise<br>
sequence w" with a flat spectrum over the entire frequency bandwidth,<br>
using techniques well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. The<br>
generated sequence is of length N" which is the subframe length in the<br>
original domain. Note that N is the subframe length in the down-sampled<br>
domain. In this preferred embodiment, N=64 and N"=80 which<br>
correspond to 5 ms.<br>
The white noise sequence is properly scaled in the gain<br>
adjusting module 214. Gain adjustment comprises the following steps.<br>
First, the energy of the generated noise sequence w" is set equal to the<br>
energy of the enhanced excitation signal u" computed by an energy<br>
computing module 210, and the resulting scaled noise sequence is given<br>
by<br><br><br>
The second step in the gain scaling is to take into account<br>
the high frequency contents of the synthesized signal at the output of the<br>
voicing factor generator 204 so as to reduce the energy of the generated<br>
noise in case of voiced segments (where less energy is present at high<br>
frequencies compared to unvoiced segments). Preferably, measuring<br>
the high frequency contents is implemented by measuring the tilt of the<br>
synthesis signal through a spectral tilt calculator 212 and reducing the<br>
energy accordingly. Other measurements such as zero crossing<br>
measurements can equally be used. When the tilt is very strong, which<br>
corresponds to voiced segments, the noise energy is further reduced.<br>
The tilt factor is computed in module 212 as the first correlation<br>
coefficient of the synthesis signal Sh and it is given by:<br><br>
where voicing factor rv is given by<br><br>
where Ev is the energy of the scaled pitch codevector bvT and Ec is the<br>
energy of the scaled innovative codevector gcK, as described earlier.<br>
Voicing factor rv is most often less than tilt but this condition was<br>
introduced as a precaution against high frequency tones where the tilt<br>
value is negative and the value of rv is high. Therefore, this condition<br>
reduces the noise energy for such tonal signals.<br><br>
The tilt value is 0 in case of flat spectrum and 1 in case of<br>
strongly voiced signals, and it is negative in case of unvoiced signals<br>
where more energy is present at high frequencies.<br>
Different methods can be used to derive the scaling factor<br>
gt from the amount of high frequency contents. In this invention, two<br>
methods are given based on the tilt of signal described above.<br>
Method 1:<br>
The scaling factor gt is derived from the tilt by<br><br>
For strongly voiced signal where the tilt approaches 1, gt is<br>
0.2 and for strongly unvoiced signals gt becomes 1.0.<br>
Method 2:<br>
The tilt factor gt is first restricted to be larger or equal to<br>
zero, then the scaling factor is derived from the tilt by<br><br>
The scaled noise sequence wg produced in gain adjusting<br>
module 214 is therefore given by:<br><br><br>
When the tilt is close to zero, the scaling factor gt is close<br>
to 1, which does not result in energy reduction. When the tilt value is 1,<br>
the scaling factor gt results in a reduction of 12 dB in the energy of the<br>
generated noise.<br>
Once the noise is properly scaled (wg), it is brought into the<br>
speech domain using the spectral shaper 215. In the preferred<br>
embodiment, this is achieved by filtering the noise wg through a<br>
bandwidth expanded version of the same LP synthesis filter used in the<br>
down-sampled domain (1/Â(z/0.8)). The corresponding bandwidth<br>
expanded LP filter coefficients are calculated in the spectral shaper 215.<br>
The filtered scaled noise sequence Wf is then band-pass<br>
filtered to the required frequency range to be restored using the band-<br>
pass filter 216. In the preferred embodiment, the band-pass filter 216<br>
restricts the noise sequence to the frequency range 5.6-7.2 kHz. The<br>
resulting band-pass filtered noise sequence z is added in adder 221 to<br>
the oversampled synthesized speech signal ? to obtain the final<br>
reconstructed sound signal sout on the output 223.<br>
Although the present invention has been described<br>
hereinabove by way of a preferred embodiment thereof, this<br>
embodiment can be modified at will, within the scope of the appended<br>
claims, without departing from the spirit and nature of the subject<br>
invention. Even though the preferred embodiment discusses the use of<br>
wideband speech signals, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that<br>
the subject invention also encompasses other embodiments using<br>
wideband signals in general and that it is not necessarily limited to<br>
speech applications.<br><br>
