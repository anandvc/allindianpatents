				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Rigid axle of a utility vehicle Description<br>
The invention relates to a rigid axle of a utility vehicle, in particular a lorry or a bus, with a cast or forged axle body.<br>
A stub axle for utility vehicles, which has a cylindrical steering-pivot pin, is known from DE 28 47 035 Al, the steering swivel being mounted in a rotatable manner on the end parts of the said steering-pivot pin which project beyond the stub axle. The middle part and one of the end parts of the steering-pivot pin have the same diameter. The upper end part of the steering-pivot pin is made slightly thicker in the lower diameter than the lower end part and the middle part. The transition from the middle part to the upper end part is formed by a shoulder, by way of which the steering-pivot pin rests on the end face of the axle body.<br>
Present-day utility-vehicle manufacturers produce vehicles which differ for example with respect to their off-road mobility and their axle load. In this case the multiplicity of models of the vehicle manufacturers makes it necessary for the axles to be individually developed afresh for the corresponding demands of each type of vehicle.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide an axle body which is capable of being used in all models of a range of vehicles, in accordance with a modular construction system independently of the necessary torsional rigidity of the axle body.<br>
This object is attained according to the invention in that the axle body is reinforced on its longitudinal side by an angle section which rests against at least two sides of the axle<br>
 <br>
body.<br>
It is advantageous that the invention is capable of being used for all rigid axles which exist in utility-vehicle construction. The reinforcement according to the invention by an angle section can be used in steered and driven axles and in leading and trailing axles. Irrespective of the size of the vehicle or the necessary torsional rigidity of the vehicle frame and the vehicle axle, it is possible for the corresponding axle body, reinforced in a standardized size but in a manner corresponding to the individual requirements, to be fitted in the different types of utility vehicles. By way of example, a front rigid axle is taken as a starting point below. With the aid of the angle section according to the invention it is possible for the standardized front axle to be reinforced in accordance with the type of utility vehicle provided for it, so that the standardized axle body is capable of being used as well for a light utility vehicle designed for road traffic as for an all-wheel-drive, heavy-duty lorry which is designed for use in difficult terrain. The invention can be used in an advantageous manner on cast or forged axle bodies for example, irrespective of the nature of the production of the axle.<br>
According to a further embodiment, the angle section rests flat against the axle body at least with one limb.<br>
In accordance with a further embodiment of the invention, at least one limb of the angle section is fastened, upright with respect to the roadway, to the axle body.<br>
In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, the axle body has a double-T profile and the upright limb of the angle section is arranged substantially parallel to the profiled web of the axle body.<br>
In accordance with a further embodiment of the invention, the angle section is fastened in the region of its ends to the axle body.<br>
 <br>
In accordance with a further embodiment of the invention, by means of the bolts by which a stabilizer is fastened to the axle body the angle section is also arranged on the axle body at the same location.<br>
In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, the angle section is fastened to the axle body in the region of the plate of the said axle body carrying the vehicle suspension.<br>
Further advantageous arrangements and expedient further developments of the rigid axle according to the invention are set out in the description of the example with reference to the accompanying drawing. In the drawing<br>
Fig. 1     is an overall view of an axle body with an angle section and a cut-away illustration of a stabilizer;<br>
Fig. 2    shows, cut away at the side in each case, an axle body and an angle section arranged thereon, and<br>
Fig. 3    is a side view of an angle section arranged on an axle body.<br>
Fig. 1 is an overall view of an axle body 1 with an angle section 2 fastened to it at the side. The axle body 1 is constructed in the form of a stub axle with a stub 3 formed at each end of the axle body 1. The axle body 1 has one shoulder 4 in each case against which the stack of spring leaves (not shown) comes to rest. The angle section 2 is connected to the axle body 1 in the region of the stubs 3 and at a plurality of points in the region of the shoulders 4. The connexion can be carried out with the aid of bolts 5 or pins. It is also possible for the angle section 2 to be welded to the axle body 1. The angle section 2 has two limbs 7 and 8, of which the limb 7 is upright with respect to the roadway and the limb 8 rests flat on the lower of the two webs 9 extending substantially parallel to the roadway. The two limbs 7 and 8 of the angle section 2 extend substantially at an angle of 90Â°. In the region of the shoulders 4 the angle section 2 has one tongue 10 in each case which is<br>
 <br>
directed opposite the roadway and which forms an enlarged abutment face for receiving at least two connexion points between the angle section 2 and the axle body 1 in each case. In the region of the rear shoulder 4 the angle section 2 is fastened to the axle body 1 by the bolts 5 which connect the bearing 11 of the stabilizer 12 to the axle body 1. The stabilizer 12 is shown only in part in Fig. 1. Depending upon the torsional rigidity required, the angle section 2 can be arranged on the axle body 1 in different thicknesses and in different lengths. The angle section 2 can also have more than two limbs 7, 8 and can enclose the axle body 1 on three sides for example. The reinforcement of the axle body 1 by the angle section 2 can be varied by the number of the connexion points for the bolts 5 or pins between the angle section 2 and the axle body 1. It is to be assumed that at least two connexion points are provided between the angle section 2 and the axle body 1. It is possible for more than one angle section 2 to be arranged on the double-T profile for example. It is possible for a U-shaped angle section (not shown) for example to rest with its base against the profiled web 13. A further angle section 2 can be arranged for example on the axle body 1 in the manner indicated in Fig. 1. The angle at which the limbs 7 and 8 respectively of the angle section 2 are arranged can be varied depending upon the external profile of the axle body 1. In this case it is possible for the axle body 1, as shown in Fig. 1, to have a double-T profile, but the axle body 1 can also have a substantially round external profile.<br>
Fig. 2 shows an axle body 1 with an angle section 2 fastened to it in a manner corresponding to Fig. 1, with the difference that the axle body 1 and the angle section 2 are cut approximately in the middle between the two shoulders 4. The angle section 2 rests with its limb 8 against the web 9 of the axle body 1, whereas the limb 7 of the angle section 2 is angled upwards substantially at a right angle to the roadway and rests on the axle body 1 at three connexion points 14. The mutually angled arrangement of the limbs 7 and 8 respectively increases the torsional rigidity of the angle section 2. For an additional increase in the rigidity of the angle section 2, further ribs, for example axial ribs and/or ribs extending radially, can be arranged in the said angle section 2. The angle section 2 can be arranged<br>
 <br>
in different lengths on the axle body 1. It is possible for the angle section 2 to have a U-shape and to engage around the axle body 1 at least in part on mutually opposite faces of the external periphery of the axle body 1.<br>
Fig. 3 shows, substantially at the side from below, the angle section 2 arranged on the axle body 1. It is clear from Fig. 3 that the angle section 2 is adapted to the bend 15 of the axle body 1 towards the stub 3 as viewed in the longitudinal direction towards the axle body 1.<br>
