				<td>FIELD<br>
The present Invention relates to a laundry detergent bar composition containing a peroxygen bleach. More specifically, the present invention relates to a laundry detergent bar containing both percarbonate and perborate.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
In societies where mechanical washing machines are not common, laundry detergent bars comprising synthetic organic surfactants and detergency builders are used in the laundering of clothes. Technical developments in the field of laundry detergent bars have concerned formulating bars which are effective in cleaning clothes; which have acceptable sudsing characteristics in warm and cool water and in hard and soft water; which have acceptable In-use wear rates, hardness, durability, and feel; which have low smear; and which have a pleasing odor and appearance.<br>
Laundry bar compositions typically contain peroxygen bleach, such as perborate and percarbonate bleach. Peroxygen bleach compounds have been used commercially as a source of active oxygen In bleaching, detergent, cleaning, rinsing, and scouring formulations. Although not wanting to be limited by theory, their effectiveness is believed to result from an oxidatlve process which decolorizes or removes impurities or foreign matter from the material being treated. Two examples of peroxygen compounds that have been used as a source of active oxygen in these formulations are perborate and percarbonate.<br>
It has now been found that a laundry detergent bar composition containing perborate and percarbonate bleach in a specific ratio has Improved bleaching benefit and is effective for a wide variety of stain removal.<br>
None of the existing art provides all of the advantages and benefits of the present invention.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The present invention is directed to a laundry detergent bar composition having both perborate and percarbonate in a specific ratio of from about 85:15 to about 30:70.<br>
A preferred bar composition contains perborate and percarbonate at a more specific ratio, wherein the ratio of the perborate and the percarbonate is from about 65:15 to about 50:50, more preferably, from about 80:20 to about 50:50,<br>
These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the present invention will become evident to those skilled In the art from a reading of the present disclosure.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
While the specification concludes wrth claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the Invention, it is believed the present invention will be better understood from the following description.<br>
All percentages are by weight of total composition unless specifically stated otherwise.<br>
All ratios are weight ratios unless specifically stated otherwise.<br>
As used herein, "comprising" means that other steps and other ingredients which do not affect the end result can be added. This term encompasses the terms * consisting of" and' consisting essentially of.<br>
All cited references are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. Citation of any reference is not an admission regarding any determination as to its availability as prior art to the claimed invention.<br>
Although not wanting to be limited by theory, it Is believed that the bleach performance on stains is dependent upon the type of peroxygen bleach used in the bar composition. A specific peroxygen bleach may be effective for one type of stain removed, but less effective for another type of stain removal. For example, perborate Is effective for bleaching/decolorizing polyphenollc stains such as tea and coffee but not as effective for bleaching stains containing guar<br>
gums such as chocolate stains. On the other hand, percarbonate is more effective on chocolate stains but not as effective as perborate on other types of stains, So a laundry detergent bar composition containing both perborate and percarbonate bleach at a specific ratio has improved bleaching benefit and is effective for a wide variety of stain removal. Perborate and Percarfoongfe<br>
The laundry bars of the present invention contain perborate and percarbonate ata ratio of from about 90:10 to about 10;90.<br>
Perborate also known as peroxoborate, and/or salts of perborate may be used in the present invention. Examples Include sodium perborate, lithium perborate, potassium perborate, rubidium perborate, cesium perborate, ammonium perborate, barium perborate are known. Potassium perborate and sodium perborate are preferable; sodium perborate is more preferable. Sodium perborate's chemical formula is described as NaBC^HjO or Na2B4.0$10H20. Particularly preferred are sodium perborate tetrahydrate, and especially, sodium perborate monohydrate. Sodium perborate monohydrate is especially preferred because it Is very stable during storage and yet still dissolves very quickly in the bleaching solution. Perborate Is commercially available by Solvay-intenox, but any other commercially available material can also be used for the present invention,<br>
Percarbonate, also Known as peroxocarbonate, and/or salts of percarbonate, may also be used. Examples include sodium .percarbonate, ammonium percarbonate, potassium percarbonate or rubidium percarbonate are known. Potassium percarbonate or sodium percarbonate is preferable; sodium percarbonate is more preferable. Sodium percarbonate's chemical formula Is described as Na2CO,.nHaOz , where n can range from Y*. to 5. Preferable percarbonate is where n - !4 to 3. Percarbonate Is commercially available by Sclvay-lnterox and Degussa, but any other commercially available material can also be used for the present invention. Percarbonate bleach contains dry particles having an average particle size in the range from about 500 micrometers to about 1,000 micrometers, wherein not more than about 10% by weight of the particles are smaller than about 200 micrometers and wherein not more than about 10% by weight of the particles are larger than about 1,250 micrometers. Optionally, the percarbonate can be coated with silicate, borate or water-soluble surfactants.<br>
A preferred bar composition contains perborate and percarbonate at a more specific ratio, wherein the ratio of the perborate and the percarbonate is from about 85:15 to about 30:70, more preferably, from about 80:20 to about 50:50.<br>

The detergent laundry bars of the present invention can be processed in conventional soap or detergent bar making equipment with some or all of the following key equipment: blender/mixer, mill or refining plodder, two-stage vacuum plodder, logo printer/cutter, cooling tunnel and wrapper.<br>
In a typical process the raw materials are mixed in the blender. Alkyl benzene sulfonic acid is reacted with alKatlne inorganic salts to complete neutralization, the amount of alkaline Inorganic salt being at least sufficient to<br>
completely neutralize the acid. At least 5% of the phosphate builder can be present during the neutralization reaction. Preferably at least 10% can be present. Then other optional surfactants followed by any additional optional components such as chelating agents are added. The mixing can take from one minute to one hour, with the usual mixing time being from about two to twenty minutes. The blender mix is charged to a surge tank. The product Is conveyed from the surge tank to the mill or refining plodder via a multi-worm conveyor.<br>
After milling or preliminary plodding, the product is then conveyed to a two-stage vacuum plodder, operating at high vacuum, e.g. 600 to 740 mm of mercury vacuum, so that entrapped air/gas is removed. The product is extruded and cut to the desired bar length, and printed with the product brand name. The printed bar Is preferably cooled, for example in a cooling tunnel, before ft is wrapped, cased, and sent to storage. It la preferred that the packed cases of bars be stored at a temperature of 20 • 30*C immediately after packing. Without intending to be limited by theory, this step allows the bars to reach a stable state, physically as well as chemically. After this stabilizing stage, storing the bars at a high temperature and humidity condition should not affect the bar's physical properties and aesthetics.<br>
A preferred laundry bar composition is made by the following method: The raw maten'als are first mixed in a blender. STPP, sodium carbonate and pre-neutralized CFAS (if a mixture of CFAS/LAS is used as surfactant system) are mixed for about 1-2 minutes This is followed by the addition of linear alkyl benzene sulfonic acid and sulfuric acid (if present In the formulation). The acids are then completely neutralized by the sodium carbonate in the seat of the blender. (The amount of sodium carbonate should be at least an amount sufficient to neutralize the adds.) Then, a chelating agent, if present is added, followed by other optional surfactants (if present), and any other additional optional components. The total mixing time can take up to about one hour, with the usual mixing time being from about five to twenty minutes. As one of the last ingredients, sodium perborate and sodium percarboante at a specific ratio and optionally, enzymes can be added to the mixture and then mixed, preferably, for an additional 2 minutes. It is preferred that when the peroxygen bleaches are added as one of the last ingredients, the temperature of the blender mixture is about 45 to 65°C. The blender mix is charged to a surge tank. The product is conveyed from the surge tank to the mill or refining plodder via a multi-worm conveyor.<br>
After milling or preliminary plodding, the product is then conveyed to a two-stage vacuum plodder, operating at high vacuum, e.g. 600 to 740 mm of mercury vacuum, so that entrapped air Is removed. The product is extruded and cut to the desired oar length, and printed with the product brand name. The printed bar is cooled, for example in a cooling tunnel, before it is wrapped, cased, and sent to storage as described above.<br>
