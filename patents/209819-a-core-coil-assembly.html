[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"A CORE-COIL ASSEMBLY"<br>
METGLAS,  INC.,  of 440 Allied Drive,  Conway,  South Carolina 29526, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to inductor core-coil assembly for use as magnetic components in electric and electronic circuits such as converters, inverters, noise filters, resonant circuits, and the like.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Currently two types of magnetic cores are widely used in the inductive components in electric and electronic circuits such as AC-to-DC and DC-to-DC converters, inverters, filters for electronic noises, electronic resonant circuits and the like. One kind is a toroidally-shaped core with no physical gap and the other has at least one gap. In both cases, copper winding(s) must be applied on the core to form a magnetic inductor. When the required copper wire sue is thin, the copper winding can be automated and equipment for such operation is available. However, due to the nature of this operation, such equipment requires a wire handling mechanism akin to that of a sewing machine which uses flexible threads. When the wire size is thick, such automated process becomes difficult and manual copper winding is a standard practice. It is therefore desirable to simplify the existing copper winding mechanism which enables to improve the winding productivity in general and eliminate the manual winding operation for the components requiring thick-gauge wires.  -<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the invention, there is provided a core-coil assembly and manufacturing thereof. A magnetic core has at least one physical gap and an<br><br>
insulated core assembly is formed by coating the gapped magnetic core with an<br><br>
electrical insulator or covering it with an insulating box having a physical gap whose dimension is close to that of the magnetic core gap. A copper wire passes through the gap of the core or the core assembly to be wound on the core or the<br><br>
core assembly. The copper-wire winding is also performed by rotating the core<br>
	•	•<br>
or the core assembly around the tangential direction of the circumference of the<br>
core or the core assembly. To improve magnetic performance of a gapped core,<br>
i<br>
a non-conventional gap is introduced whose direction is off the radial direction<br>
of a toroidally wound core. The magnetically improved core with a non-<br>
conventional gap can be housed in a conventional core box with no gap and a<br>
copper winding may be applied on it to use h as in inductor. The copper winding<br>
part, on the other hand, can be prefabricated separately and a gapped core or core<br>
assembly is then inserted into the prefabricated coil through the gap. The gap<br>
	.	'.        '<br>
section of the core or the core assembly may be filled with a magnetic or non¬magnetic spacer during or after coil-winding operation. The core-coil<br>
assembling method of the present invention is much simpler than the existing<br>
method and thus is fully or semi-automated, improving core-coil assembly<br>
production yield with consistent performance.<br>
The core-coil assembly manufactured in accordance with the method of the present invention is especially suited for use in such devices as power converters, inverters, electrical noise filters, electrical resonators, and the like.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A simpJer manufacturing method for magnetic core-coil assembly improves its<br>
performance as well as its production capability through automated processes.<br>
Figure 1 represents a core-coil assembly of the present invention. The core 1 is<br>
composed of a magnetic core 11 with a gap 11a of width or size G and a two-<br>
i part insulating boxes 12 and 13 with gaps 12a and 13a, respectively as shown in<br>
Figure 2. Steps shown in Figures 3a - 3d explain the sequence of coil winding<br>
on the core assembly 1. A copper wire 21 is first inserted, as shown in Figure<br>
3b, through gap 10 of core assembly 1 of Figure 3a. After the first winding,<br>
successive windings are performed by moving the wire through gap 10 as<br>
indicated in Figures 3c-3d until a predetermined number of rums is completely<br>
wound. The above operation results in a basic core-coil assembly of Figure 1 of<br>
the present invention. The core-coil assembling is also performed by a method<br>
shown in Figure 4, in which item 21 is the copper wire and item 22 is a spool of<br>
i	■<br>
wire! This process begins with attaching one end 21a of copper wire 21 to a point on a core assembly as shown in Figure 4a. Coil winding is accomplished by rotating the core assembly around the tangential direction of the core's<br><br>
circumference. Thus the wire spool 22 needs not to be rotated. Thi<br>
results in the core-coil assembly of Figure 1.<br>
In the process described above, when the magnetic core is coated w insulating layer or when the copper wire is adequately coated with a layer, insulating boxes 12 and 13 of Figure 2 may not be needed. Bom oi uie processes corresponding to Figure 3 and 4 are much simpler than the existing coil-winding process based on a sewing machine mechanism and are easily automated.<br>
When a spacer 3 is need in the gap section 10, it may be inserted during or after<br>
coil winding as shown in Figure 5. In this figure, spacer 3 is a non-magnetic<br>
material or an electrically conductive material, in which case an insulating layer<br>
may be applied on the surface of the spacer. The spacer 3 may be a laminated<br>
magnetic material 31 shown in Figure 5b or a magnetic powder-based material<br>
32 shown in Figure 5c. In these cases, the effective air gap is Gl + G2 as<br>
indicated in Figure 6, in which only the case with spacer 31 is shown with item<br>
33; and 34 being non-magnetic adhesives. After insertion of a spacer, a final<br>
core-coil assembly of Figure 1 is now accomplished.<br>
Figure 7 compares the DC bias characteristics for the inductance of a core-coil assembly of the present invention. Region A and B correspond, respectively, to<br>
"active" and "inactive" DC bias region, when a control core-coil assembly is<br><br>
used as a choke coil exhibiting an inductance versus DC bias current  . characteristic corresponding to curve C. Here the terms "active" and "inactive*' mean that the choke coil is functioning as an effective and ineffective inductor, respectively. If the gap G is reduced and or the number of copper winding is increased in Figure 1 with respect to the control core-coil assembly, the inductance versus DC bias current curve shifts to the one indicated by C\ If the<br><br>
gap G is increased and/or the number of copper winding rums is decreased with respect to the control core-coil assembly, curve C" results.<br>
If the core 12 in Figure 1 exhibits an inductance versus DC bias current characteristic of "CI" in Figure 8 where AI and Bl correspond to an active and inactive regions, respectively and the core insert material 31 or 32 in Figure 5 exhibits the bias characteristic of "C2", a resultant bias characteristic of "CO" results, when the material corresponding to "CI" is used as core 11 and the material corresponding to "C2" is used as a spacer "31" or "32" in Figure 6.<br><br>
In accordance with the present invention, yet another method of fabricating a<br>
core-coil assembly is provided. An example of the core-coil assembly is shown<br>
in Figure 9, where item 6 is a spacer with a width G, item 4 is a core assembly<br>
and 5 represents copper winding with two leads 53 and 54. Figure 10 is a top<br>
view of a core assembly 4, where Z is the center of the toroidal core axis. The<br>
major difference between this core configuration and the one depicted in Figures<br>
1-6 is the position of gap 40, the center of which is displaced from "Y" axis<br>
(X=k&gt;) up to X= ZQ-G/2, where ZQ is the distance between Z and the one end of<br>
the gap as indicated in Figure 10. As shown in Figure 10, when ZQ=ZR where<br>
ZR is the inner diameter of the core assembly, the plane QT is tangential to the<br>
inner circle of the core assembly. Figure 11 shows a prefabricated coil 50 whose<br>
inner dimension is such that the core assembly can be inserted into this coil. For<br>
example, the distance H in Figure 11 should be slightly larger than the core<br>
assembly width W in Figure 10. Figure 12a shows how a prefabricated coil 50 is<br>
fitted through a gap 40 into a core assembly of Figure 10. When the coil 50 is<br>
placed on the core assembly 4, a spacer 6 may be inserted into gap 40 as shown<br>
in Figure 12b and the coil configuration may be modified to have a uniform<br>
distribution of copper windings on the core assembly as shown in Figure 12c.<br>
The coil in Figure 11 and 12 has a rectangular shape, but a cylinder-shaped coil<br><br>
maybe used for the same purpose. The pacer6ofFigure9maybeofa<br>
magnetic or non-magnetic material as in Figure 5. When spacer 6 is electrically<br>
conductive, its surface may be covered with a layer of insulating tape or<br>
insulating coating. Thus the above process results in a core-coil assembly of Figure 9 with leads S3 and 54.<br>
The advantages of the above core-coil assembly include separate fabrication of core assembly and. copper coil, each process being fully or semi-automated using simple and inexpensive equipment, In addition, due to increased surface area in<br><br>
the  gapped regions of the magnetic core, gap width G in Figure J 0 can be<br>
increased from the gap width of a core of Figure 31' with the same physical<br>
|	■.■■_■'<br>
dimension as that of Figure 10, maintaining the same overall effective permeability. If the gap size is unchanged, on the other hand, effective permeability increases and core loss decreases when the core-coil assembly configuration of Figure 9 is adopted over that of Figure 1. The improved magnetic performance of the core configuration of Figure 10 is also achieved in a core-coil assembly in which the outer core box does not have a gap, which corresponds to the case where an automatic coil winding is not an issue.<br>
In accordance with the present invention which provides a means of automated coil winding processes for magnetic cores, the prefabricated coil 50 of Figure 12a is not only a wire with circular cross-section 51 of Figure 13b which results<br>
in a core-coil assembly with a top view of Figure 13a where gap 6, coil 5 and<br><br>
core assembly 4 are indicated, but also a wire with a rectangular cross-section 55<br>
i<br>
of Figure 14b which results in a core-coil assembly of Figure 14a and a wire<br><br>
with a trapezoidal cross-section 56 of Figure 15b resulting in a core-coil assembly of FigurelSa. The core-coil assembly of Figure 15a helps to increase the cross-section of the copper wire, resulting in an increased packing area for electrical conduction, which in turn reduces the size of the core-coil assembly<br><br>
and inter-winding capacitance. Furthermore, the coil configuration of Figure 15a makes it easier to form a prefabricated coil 50 of Figure 12 because of the geometry of the coirs cross-section shown in Figure 15b.<br>
To demonstrate the difference between the present invention and the prior art. Figures 16-18 are provided. Figure 16 represents a core-coil assembly of a prior art; where core assembly 7 has a copper winding 8 with electrical leads 83 and 841 Figure 17 shows a magnetic core 71 with a gap G and the two halves 72 and 73 of an insulating box. Figure 18a depicts a core assembly 7 which has a hole 70 in the middle of the toroidally-shaped core assembly. Figure 18b shows the beginning of a coil winding process where a copper wire 81 with its end 81a is fed through the hole 70 of a core assembly of Figure 18a.   Subsequent copper<br>
winding is performed as shown in Figure 18c. The copper winding process<br>
i<br>
represented in Figures 18b-c requires a mechanical process akin to that of a<br><br>
sewing machine.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
1.     Sample Preparation<br>
Magnetic cores were prepared by consolidating magnetic powder or winding a magnetic-metal ribbon onto a mandrel. When necessary, the cores were then beat-treated to achieve required magnetic properties. The cores were cut by an abrasive cutting tool or by a water jet to introduce a gap. Copper windings were applied on each core for magnetic measurements.<br>
2.        Magnetic Measurements<br>
The inductance of a core-coil assembly was measured by a commercially<br>
! . available inductance bridge and the core's magnetic core loss was measured by<br>
the method described in the IEEE Standard 393-1931.<br><br>
3.        Magnetic Properties of Core-Coil Assemblies<br>
Core-coils assemblies in accordance with the present invention were evaluated-<br>
i	■	■   ■	.	. •    ■	■<br>
Figure 19 compares the inductance measured at 1 kHz as a function of bias<br>
i *<br>
current for two types of core-coil assemblies, one with the configuration of<br>
i<br>
Figure 9 which resulted in curve A and the other corresponding to Figure 1<br>
i<br>
which resulted in curve B. The size of the cores for both cases was 22 mm x 15<br>
mm x 15 mm for outside diameter, inside diameter and core height, respectively,<br>
the gap G was 1 mm for both cases. The core material was iron powder. The<br>
core-coil configuration of Figure 9 exhibited a higher inductance than that of<br>
Figure 1 at lower bias current, the tendency of which was reversed at higher bias<br>
current levels. In light of the cases depicted in Figure 7, this indicates that the<br>
gap size G can be increased without affecting the inductance versus bias current<br>
characteristics when the core assembly configuration of Figure 9 is adopted over<br>
that of Figure 1. The increased gap size makes the core-coil assembly process of<br>
Figure 11 easier. If a higher permeability is desired at lower DC bias region, the<br>
i core-coil assembly of Figure 9 maybe adopted over that of Figure J without<br>
I reducing the gap size.<br>
i The core losses of the two types of cores of Figure 19 were measured at difTerest<br>
frequencies as a function of magnetic induction, which are shown in Figure 20.<br>
It is clear that core loss at any given frequency is lower for the core-coil<br>
configuration of Figure 9 corresponding to curves A than that of Figure I<br>
corresponding to curves B, both of which have the same gap size.<br><br>
Having thus described the invention rather fully in detail, it will be understood<br>
that this detail needs not be strict Jy adhered to but that further changes and<br>
modifications may suggest themselves to one skilled in the art all falling within<br>
the scope of the invention as defined by the subjoined claims.<br><br>
