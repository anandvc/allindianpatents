The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br>
1      Agent Docket No: BL/PAT/IN/085/001<br><br>
Field of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a novel mechanism for loading and holding hot <br>
optical fiber preform and precursors thereof. Particularly, the present invention relates to <br>
5	a novel mechanism for loading and holding hot optical fiber preform and precursors thereof, capable of loading and holding bulky optical fiber preform and precursors <br>
thereof reducing overall manufacturing time and making the transportation of optical <br>
fiber preform and precursors thereof simple and safe.<br>
10     Background of Invention:<br>
The role of Optical fibers has become significant in the field of communications.<br>
There has been a momentous increase in usage of optical fibers. It is expected that the use<br>
of optical fibers in local loop telephone and cable TV service will increase in order to<br>
15     deliver greater amount of information in the form of data, audio, and video signals to<br>
 residential and commercial users.<br>
Optical fiber comprise a core and a cladding surrounding the core. The refractive index of core is higher as compared with the refractive index of the cladding in order to<br>
20     achieve light transmission inside the optical fiber, by the phenomena known as total internal reflection. Generally, either the refractive index of the core is substantially uniform across its diameter (also called step index optical fiber) or the refractive index of the core has a maximum at the center and decrease in parabolic fashion near the periphery (also called graded index optical fiber). Any other geometric shape and profile<br>
25     of the refractive index of the core is possible catering to a particular need.<br>
It is desirable that the manufacturing process of the optical fiber preform and<br>
precursors thereof to be economical in order to support the increasing demand of optical<br>
fiber and that too at low cost, meaning thereby, it is necessary to improve the production<br>
30     efficiency of the optical fiber manufacturing process. Reducing the manufacturing time<br>
      can enhance the production efficiency of the optical fiber preform and precursors<br>
2     Agent Docket No: BL/PAT/IN/085/001<br><br>
manufacturing process, which in turn means that it is necessary to reduce the optical fiber preform and precursors manufacturing process time as much as possible.<br>
         In batch type manufacturing, the optical fiber is obtained by drawing optical fiber<br>
 5       preform. The optical fiber preform is an enlarged image of optical fiber, which like the       optical fiber comprises a central core portion and an outer cladding. The core portion comprises the core and a part of cladding of the fiber preform. The core portion of the optical fiber preform can be prepared by any known methods, for example, by Atmospheric Chemical Vapor Deposition (ACVD) method, wherein the soot is deposited<br>
10    during the deposition process step on the cylindrical member (also referred as target rod or mandrel) with a hollow glass handle intact, used for ease of handling the soot porous body so formed. In this method, the soot deposition is accomplished by traverse motion of the cylindrical member over the burners or vice versa while rotating the cylindrical member. The burners are supplied with silicon containing materials (for example silicon<br>
15   	tetrachloride), gases supporting oxidation (for example oxygen) and heat producing gases (for example hydrogen, methane etc). The oxidation of silicon containing materials takes place resulting in the formation of oxides of silicon, which is generally referred to as soot. The initial soot deposition comprises dopant chemicals (for example germanium tetrachloride) to increase refractive index of the core and dopant chemicals are terminated<br>
20    after desired core diameter is obtained. The deposition process continues until the required dimension of the soot porous body is attained for meeting desired core diameter in the optical fiber preform and the desired core-clad diameter ratio in the fiber. After completion of soot deposition and on cooling the soot porous body to room temperature, the cylindrical member is removed from the soot porous body, to form hollow cylindrical<br>
25     soot porous body defining a capillary at the center [herein after referred to as hollow soot porous body]. The hollow soot porous body so formed by the ACVD method contains large amount of hydroxyl group or water as generally referred to. In order to remove the hydroxyl content of the hollow soot porous body, it is treated with gases, which chemically reacts with the hydroxyl group. Halogens or compounds of halogen are<br>
30     generally used for such purpose. This step of removing the hydroxyl content from the hollow soot porous body is known as dehydration or drying. In this step of dehydration or<br>
3      Agent Docket No: BL/PAT/IN/085/001<br><br>
drying at first a glass plug is inserted into the end remote from the handle of the hollow soot porous body. The cooled hollow soot porous body is moved into a furnace, suspended by the hollow handle in the furnace, wherein this hollow soot porous body is heated at a temperature of about 1050°C in an atmosphere of gases of halogens or <br>
5     compounds thereof to remove the hydroxyl content for a predetermined duration of time. Thereafter the dehydrated hollow soot porous body is sintered to form a glass preform in an atmosphere of gases of halogens or compounds thereof at a temperature of about 1500°C. This step of sintering of hollow soot porous body into glass is also known as vitrification or consolidation.<br>
10<br>
The dehydration and sintering processes can be carried out by any method known in the art. Preferably, it can be carried out inside specially built furnaces that are equipped with one or more heating elements and gas input mechanisms. Both the dehydration and sintering processes can be carried out in same furnaces or separate furnaces. Preferably,<br>
15 	both the dehydration and sintering are carried out in same furnace. The dehydration and sintering processes comprises the steps of inserting the hollow soot porous body into a sintering furnace and subjecting it to a temperature regime under controlled chemical environment to form sintered glass preform. The chemical environment necessary for dehydration is provided with the help of gases that promote dehydration. The chemical<br>
20 	environment that is necessary for sintering is provided with gases that are inert and have high thermal conductivity.<br>
The capillary in the soot porous body is collapsed either during the sintering step or after the sintering step. After removal of the sintered glass preform (also called as<br>
25 	mother preform) from the sintering furnace and cooling down to room temperature, it is subjected to a process step of rod draw to form a plurality of core rods having predetermined diameter. Optical fiber can also be drawn from the mother preform at this stage. In this case the mother preform is transferred to the optical fiber drawing furnace after cooling it to room temperature.<br>
30<br>
4     Agent Docket No: BL/PAT/IN/085/001<br><br>
The clad portion of the optical fiber preform is prepared by subjecting the core rod drawn to soot deposition, forming soot porous body containing core rod. This step of depositing soot over the core rod is called overcladding. Before depositing soot onto the core rod, the solid glass handles are attached to both the ends of the core rod for ease of <br>
5	            handling the optical fiber preform or precursors thereof. The soot porous body formed is then removed from the deposition machine, after cooling to room temperature it is transferred to a dehydration and sintering furnace, suspended by the glass handles, to form what is known as daughter preform. The daughter preform is transferred to optical fiber drawing furnace after cooling to room temperature and optical fiber is drawn <br>
10     therefrom.<br>
The word precursors) is used to indicate all the intermediate products formed during the manufacture of daughter preform. The word precursor(s) therefore includes, the soot porous body, hollow soot porous body, the sintered preform (mother preform), <br>
15     the soot porous body with core rod assembly (while preparing the daughter preform) etc.<br>
It is observed that at every stage of the optical fiber preform manufacturing process the temperature of the optical fiber preform is high, typically the temperature of the optical fiber preform and the precursors thereof is in the range of about 800°C to<br>
20 	about 1600°C or more and hence the optical fiber preform and precursors thereof need to be handled safely. It is also necessary to transfer the optical fiber preform and precursors thereof from one stage to another. Since the temperature of the optical fiber preform and the precursors thereof is in the range of about 800°C to about 1600°C or more, it is observed that it is neither possible nor safe to handle the optical fiber preform and<br>
25    	          precursors thereof manually at such high temperatures.<br>
It has also been observed that as the demand for the optical fiber is increasing, it<br>
is necessary to produce bulky optical fiber preforms to increase production and reduce<br>
cost. At present the weight of the optical fiber preform and precursors thereof being<br>
30     	  produced is, for example, in the order of 20 kg or more and length of a meter or more,<br>
which is definitely neither safe nor easy to handle by a human being.<br>
5     Agent Docket No: BL/PAT/IN/085/001<br><br>
It is also an observation that in the manual handling of the optical fiber preform and the precursors thereof there is always a possibility of human error leading to damage or complete loss of the optical fiber preform and the precursors thereof due to falling. <br>
5<br>
It is also observed that the optical fiber preform and the precursors thereof need<br>
to be handled carefully so that the surfaces of optical fiber preform and the precursors<br>
thereof are not damaged or contaminated which in turn may result in an optical fiber with<br>
low tensile strength and undesired optical parameters, for example attenuation of the<br>
10     	          optical fiber, being drawn therefrom rendering it unsuitable for desired applications.<br>
The U.S. Patent application number 20070080613 [herein after referred to as US '613] discloses about a storage and transportation device for storage and transportation of optical fiber preforms and precursors thereof. The storage and transportation device for <br>
15    optical fiber preforms is suitable for protecting the optical fiber preform and precursors thereof by isolating the same from dust particles/foreign particles and environmental gases (contamination of optical fiber preform and the precursors thereof).<br>
Though the device of US '613 for storage and transportation of optical fiber <br>
20 	preform is capable of isolating the optical fiber preform from dust particles/foreign particles and environmental gases (that is contamination of the optical fiber preform and the precursors thereof), while transferring the optical fiber preform and precursors thereof from one stage to another or transferring optical fiber preform and the precursors thereof from one stage to the device of US' 613 for storage and transportation, it is inevitable to <br>
25     cool the optical fiber preform and precursors thereof to room temperature.<br>
From the above discussion it is clear that at every stage of optical fiber preform<br>
manufacturing the temperatures of the optical fiber preform and precursors thereof are<br>
quite high. It is necessary to cool the optical fiber preform and precursors thereof to room<br>
30     temperature so that they can be handled safely. It has been observed by the inventor of<br>
 the present invention that about 15% of the total optical fiber manufacturing process time<br>
6      Agent Docket No: BL/PAT/IN/085/001<br><br>
is wasted in cooling the optical fiber preform and precursors thereof to room temperature at various stages. Thus the constraint of cooling the optical fiber preform and precursors thereof to room temperature increases the overall process time and hence the cost of the optical fiber manufacturing process. Also the safety of the operator is at stake if the <br>
5     	   optical fiber preform and precursors thereof are handled at high temperatures.<br>
Need of the Invention:<br>
Accordingly, there is a need to have a mechanism for loading and holding hot 10 optical fiber preform and precursors thereof in order to reduce the manufacturing time of the optical fiber preform and the precursors thereof and thus reduce the cost of the optical fiber manufacturing, eliminating the need for cooling of the optical fiber preform and precursors thereof to room temperature and the hot optical fiber preform and precursors thereof can be loaded, held and transferred safely and easily from one stage to another <br>
15     without manual intervention.<br>
Objects and Advantages of the Invention:<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a mechanism for loading <br>
20     	 and holding the hot optical fiber preform and precursors thereof.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a mechanism for loading and holding the hot optical fiber preform and precursors thereof so as to reduce the manufacturing time and hence the cost of the optical fiber preform and precursors<br>
 25    thereof.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a mechanism for loading and holding the hot optical fiber preform and precursors thereof so that the need for cooling of the precursors and the optical fiber preform is eliminated.<br>
 30<br>
7     Agent Docket No: BL/PAT/IN/085/001<br><br>
Still further object of the present invention is to provide a mechanism for loading and holding the hot optical fiber preform and the precursors thereof such that the hot optical fiber preform can be transferred safely from one stage to another without manual intervention. <br>
5<br>
It also an object of the present invention is to provide a mechanism for loading and holding the hot optical fiber preform and the precursors thereof, which is easy to operate.<br>
10		Further object of the present invention is to provide a mechanism for loading and<br>
holding the hot optical fiber preform and the precursors thereof so that the surfaces of optical fiber preform and the precursors thereof are not damaged or contaminated which in turn may result in an optical fiber breaks or undesired optical parameters, for example attenuation of the optical fiber, being drawn therefrom.<br>
15<br>
Still further object of the present invention to provide a mechanism for loading and holding the hot optical fiber preform and the precursors thereof such that in the manual handling of the optical fiber preform and the precursors thereof the possibility of human error leading to damage or complete loss of the optical fiber preform and the<br>
20              precursors thereof due to falling is eliminated.<br><br>

5     Brief Description of the Invention:<br>
The present invention attempts to solve the problem of loading and holding hot <br>
optical fiber preform and precursors thereof and reducing the manufacturing time of the <br>
optical fiber preform and precursors thereof and thus reducing the manufacturing cost of <br>
10 	the optical fiber preform and precursors thereof, eliminating the need for cooling of the optical fiber preform and precursors thereof to room temperature, meaning thereby, the hot optical fiber preform and precursors thereof can be held and transferred safely and easily from one stage to another without manual intervention.<br>
15		Accordingly, the present invention relates to a novel mechanism for loading and<br>
holding hot optical fiber preform and precursors thereof, thereby, reducing the manufacturing time of the optical fiber preform and precursors thereof by eliminating the requirement of cooling of the optical fiber preform and precursors thereof to room temperature and thus reducing the overall cost of the optical fiber manufacturing,<br>
20   meaning thereby, the hot optical fiber preform and precursors thereof can be held and transferred safely and easily from one stage to another without manual intervention.<br>
In accordance with preferred embodiment of the present invention the novel mechanism for loading and holding hot optical fiber preform and precursors thereof<br>
25 	comprises a pair of arms, both held at first ends onto a support bar by means of a clamp (which may be circular or rectangular or square depending upon the shape of support bar). The clamp is of diameter or dimensions slightly greater than that of the support bar. The clamp slides along the support bar and is fixed onto the support bar with the help of screw. A support member secures each of the arm of the pair of arms from longitudinal or<br>
30	lateral stress.. The support bar is preferably made of one of the metals including stainless<br>
        steel, aluminum and have grooves so that the pair of arms with the help of clamp, can<br>
10     Agent Docket No: BL/PAT/IN/085/001<br><br>
slide along the support bar. The support bar is attached to another support, herein after referred to as support frame, in such a way that the support bar can be rotated through 360 degree in both clockwise and anticlockwise direction shown by arrow. The option of rotation of the support bar helps in holding and removing the optical fiber preform and <br>
5	 the precursors thereof from any deposition machine where the deposition is done in either vertical and/or horizontal direction. The support frame is positioned onto a flat platform with wheels. The second ends of the arm pair is provided with gripping jaws. The gripping jaws are either cup-shaped or parabola shaped or bowl shaped or a combination thereof are provided with a passage of diameter slightly greater than the diameter of <br>
10 	optical fiber preform handle so that the handles can pass through. The gripping jaws do not have any moving parts. The advantage of these immovable gripping jaws is that operations are easy and fail proof. The pair of arms is loaded onto the support bar such that the bottom of the gripping jaws faces each other.<br>
15		In accordance with the present invention the mechanism for loading and holding<br>
the hot optical fiber preform or precursors thereof, is moved near to the optical fiber preform or the precursors thereof. One of the arms out of the pair of arms with the gripping jaws is positioned and fixed using a clamp at the lower end of the support bar while the other arm out of the arm pair, which is movable, is positioned at upper end of<br>
20    the support bar. One conical end of the optical fiber preform or the precursors thereof with the glass handle, are positioned in the gripping jaw of the arm positioned at the lower end of the support bar. The other conical end of the optical fiber preform or precursors thereof is the capped with the second gripping jaw of the other arm by sliding the arm in vertically downward direction and then clamping the arm with the clamp.<br>
25  	When the arm is just near the conical part of the optical fiber preform, the handle of the optical fiber is slide through the passage in the gripping jaw of the upper arm. There after the arm is slide in the vertically downward direction so as to cover or cap the conical shape of the optical fiber preform. Since the gripping jaw is either cup-shaped or parabola shaped or bowl shaped or a combination thereof, once the cup shape covers the conical<br>
30     part the optical fiber preform or precursors thereof are gripped and because of the cup-<br>
11     Agent Docket No: BL/PAT/IN/085/001<br><br>
shape or the parabola or the bowl shape the optical fiber preform or the precursors thereof cannot move or slip out in any circumstances.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment all the operations described above may be <br>
5	 executed in an automated manner or manually using the mechanism for holding the hot optical fiber preform or precursors thereof of the present invention, wherein the mechanism for holding the hot optical fiber preform or precursors thereof of the present invention is provided with electromechanical devices (not shown in figure) for carrying out the operations such as rotation of the support bar , the movement of the whole <br>
10 	mechanism , the sliding movement of the arms and so on, in case the operations are executed in an automated manner.<br><br>
In accordance with present invention the mechanism for loading and holding the <br>
hot optical fiber preform and the precursors thereof can be used at various stages of <br>
15     manufacturing of the optical fiber preform and precursors thereof.<br>
In one embodiment the mechanism for loading and holding the hot optical fiber preform and precursors thereof of the present invention can be used to remove the soot porous body after completion of soot deposition on the cylindrical member  from the <br>
20    deposition machine.<br>
In another embodiment the mechanism for loading and holding the hot optical fiber preform and precursors thereof of the present invention can be used to hold and transfer the soot porous body from which the sintered mother preform can be made or the<br>
25	sintered mother preform or the soot porous body after overcladding or the sintered daughter preform and so on. The optical fiber preform and the precursors thereof can be immediately transferred in hot condition from one stage to another, meaning thereby, the need for cooling the optical fiber preforms and the precursors thereof to room temperature at any stage is eliminated. Thus, the mechanism can be used to load, hold<br>
30  and transfer the optical fiber preform and the precursor thereof even when they are hot, meaning thereby, the process time can be shorten or reduced.<br>

20 	preform and precursors thereof comprises a pair of arms 103, both held at first ends 103a onto a support bar 105 by means of clamp 106 (which may be circular or rectangular or square depending upon the shape of support bar 105). The clamp 106 is of diameter or dimensions slightly greater than that of the support bar 105. The clamp 106 slides along the support bar 105 and fixed onto the support bar 105 with the help of screw 107. A<br>
25 	support member 104 secure each of the arm of the pair of arms 103 from longitudinal or lateral stress. The support bar 105 is made of one of the metals out of the group of metals including stainless steel, aluminum etc and have grooves 113 so that the pair of arms 103 with the help of clamp 106 can slide along the support bar 105. The support bar 105 is attached to another support, referred to as support frame 109 in such a way that the<br>
30 	support bar 105 can be rotated through 360 degree in both clockwise and anticlockwise direction shown by arrow 108. The option of rotation of the support bar 105 helps in<br>
13     Agent Docket No: BL/PAT/IN/085/001<br><br>
holding and removing the optical fiber preform and the precursors thereof from the any deposition machine where the deposition is done in either vertical and/or horizontal direction. The support frame 109 is positioned onto a flat platform 111 with wheels 112. The second ends 103b of the arm pair 103 are provided with gripping jaws 102. The <br>
5      gripping jaws 102 are either cup-shaped or parabola shaped or bowl shaped or a combination thereof and are provided with a passage 204 (figure 2A and 2C) of diameter slightly greater than the diameter of optical fiber preform handle so that the handles 405 or 702 or 802 (figure 4, figure 7 and figure 8) can pass through. The gripping jaws 102 do not have any moving parts. The advantage of these immovable gripping jaws 102 is that <br>
10     operations are easy and fail proof. The pair of arms 103 is loaded onto the support bar 105 such that the bottom 102a of the gripping jaws 103 faces each other (Figure 1 and Figure 2B).<br>
Figure 2 A illustrates the schematic top view of the bowl shaped gripping jaw 102<br>
15 	in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The gripping jaw 102 comprises of a bowl shaped body 201, with the base 203 of the bowl 201 flat (figure 2B and figure 2C), the base 203 and the bowl 201 are cut so as to form the passage 204. The diameter of passage 204 is slightly greater than that of the handle 405/702/802 of the optical fiber preform and precursors thereof so that the handle 405/702/802 can be slide<br>
20 	in. The gripping jaw 102 can be attached to the arms 103 by screwing or welding. Figure 2B illustrates the cross-sectional view of the gripping jaw 103 in accordance with the present invention. The gripping jaw 102 has two sides namely, the bottom 102a and the top 102b (figure 2B). Figure 2C illustrates a three-dimensional view of the gripping jaw 102 in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
25<br>
It has been observed that the gripping jaws 102 or 302 of the mechanism for loading and holding the hot optical fiber preform and the precursors thereof of the present invention are without any moving parts and has the advantage of being easy to operate, hold the optical fiber preform and without fear of slipping of the optical fiber preform<br>
30     and precursors thereof, during the holding and transfer from one stage to another.<br>
14     Agent Docket No: BL/PAT/IN/085/001<br><br>
In accordance with the present invention the gripping jaw 102 or 302 can be made up of any material that is non-corrosive and capable of bearing high temperature and weight of the optical fiber preform and precursors thereof.<br>
5	In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention the gripping jaw 102<br>
or 302 can be made up of one of the metals out of the group of metals including stainless steel, aluminum etc coated with teflon.<br>
In one embodiment the gripping jaw 102 or 302 can be cup-shaped or parabola 10     shaped according to the need.<br>
Now referring to figure 3 and figure 4 the working of the mechanism 301 for loading and holding the hot optical fiber preform and precursors thereof is explained. In accordance with the present invention the mechanism for loading and holding the optical<br>
15 	fiber preform or precursors thereof, is moved near to the optical fiber preform or the precursors thereof. One of the arms out of the pair of arms 303 with the gripping jaws 302 is positioned and fixed using a clamp 306, at the lower end of the support bar 305 while the other arm out of the arm pair 303, which is movable, is positioned at upper end of the support bar 305. One conical end 401b of the optical fiber preform 401 or the<br>
20 	precursors thereof with the glass handle 405, are positioned in the gripping jaw 302 of the arm positioned at the lower end of the support bar 305. The other conical end 401a of the optical fiber preform or precursors thereof is the capped with the second gripping jaw 302 of the other arm 303 by sliding the arm in vertically downward direction and then clamping the arm with screw 307 of the clamp 306. When the arm is just near the conical<br>
25 	part 401 a of the optical fiber preform 401, the handle 405 of the optical fiber preform 401 is slide through the passage 204 in the gripping jaw 302 of the upper arm. There after the arm is slide in the vertically downward direction so as to cover or cap the conical shape 401a of the optical fiber preform 401 (as shown in figure 3) completely. Since the gripping jaw 302 is either cup-shaped or parabola shaped or bowl shaped or a<br>
30 	combination thereof, once the cup shape covers the conical part 401a or 401b the optical fiber preform or precursors 401 thereof are gripped and because of the cup-shape or the<br>
15     Agent Docket No: BL/PAT/IN/085/001<br><br>
parabola or the bowl shape the optical fiber preform or the precursors thereof cannot move or slip out in any circumstances.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment all the operations described above may be <br>
5 	executed in an automated manner or manually using the mechanism for loading and holding the hot optical fiber preform or precursors thereof of the present invention, wherein the mechanism for loading and holding the hot optical fiber preform or precursors thereof of the present invention is provided with electromechanical devices (not shown in figure) for carrying out the operations such as rotation of the support bar<br>
10 	305, the movement of the whole mechanism 301, the sliding movement of the arms 303 and so on, in case if the operations are executed in an automated manner. Such automation that is, carrying out of operations such as rotation of the support bar 305, the movement of the whole mechanism 301 the sliding movements of the arms 303 are available commercially.<br>
15<br>
In accordance with present invention the mechanism for loading and holding the hot optical fiber preform and the precursors thereof can be used at various stages of manufacturing of the optical fiber preform and precursors thereof.<br>
20	In one embodiment the mechanism of the present invention can be used to remove<br>
the soot porous body after completion of soot deposition on the cylindrical member the soot preform is removed from the deposition machine.<br>
In another embodiment the mechanism of the present invention can be used to <br>
25	load, hold and transfer the soot porous body from which the sintered mother preform can be made or the sintered mother preform or the soot porous body after overcladding or the sintered daughter preform and so on. The optical fiber preform and the precursors thereof can be immediately transferred in hot condition from one stage to another, meaning thereby, the need for cooling the optical fiber preforms and the precursors thereof to<br>
 30     room temperature in any stage is eliminated. Thus, the mechanism can be used to hold<br>
16    Agent Docket No: BL/PAT/IN/085/001<br><br>
and transfer the optical fiber preform and the precursor thereof even when they are hot, meaning thereby, the process time can be shorten or reduced.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates an exemplary soot deposition machine 407, wherein, the core <br>
5 	portion of the optical fiber preform and part of the cladding is deposited by Atmospheric Chemical Vapor Deposition (ACVD) method, wherein the soot is deposited on the cylindrical member 403 (also referred as target rod or mandrel) with a hollow glass handle 405 intact, which is used for ease of handling the soot porous body 402 so formed. In this method, the deposition of soot 409 is accomplished by traverse motion of the<br>
10 	cylindrical member 403 over the burner(s) 408 or vice versa, while rotating the cylindrical member 403 (rotation indicated by the arrow 406). The burner(s) 408 are supplied with silicon containing materials (for example, silicon tetrachloride), gases supporting oxidation (for example oxygen) and heat producing gases (for example hydrogen, methane etc)  (not shown in the figure). The oxidation of silicon containing<br>
15 	materials takes place-forming oxides of silicon, which is generally referred to as soot 409. The initial soot deposition comprises dopant chemicals to increase refractive index of the core and dopant chemicals are terminated after desired core diameter is obtained. The deposition process continues until the required dimension of the soot porous body 402 is attained for meeting desired core diameter in the optical fiber preform and the<br>
20 	desired core-clad diameter ratio in the fiber. After completion of soot deposition, the soot porous body can be removed from the soot deposition machine 407 without need for cooling down to room temperature, held and transferred to storage cabin by using the mechanism for loading and holding the hot optical fiber preform and the precursors thereof of the present invention. The cylindrical member 403 is removed from the soot<br>
25 	porous body 402, after cooling the soot porous body 402 to room temperature, to form hollow soot porous body 501 defining a capillary 502 at the center [herein after referred to as hollow soot porous body]. Figure 5A and Figure 5B illustrates the cross-sectional and longitudinal view of the hollow soot porous body 501 comprising the capillary 502, the core part 503 and the part of cladding 504.<br>

17    Agent Docket No: BL/PAT/IN/085/001<br><br>
The hollow soot porous body 501 so formed by the ACVD method contains large amount of hydroxyl group or water as generally referred to. In order to remove the hydroxyl content of the hollow soot porous body 501, it is treated with gases, which chemically reacts with the hydroxyl group. Halogens or compounds of halogen are <br>
5 	generally used for such purpose. This step of removing the hydroxyl content from the hollow soot porous body is known as dehydration or drying. In this step of dehydration or drying at first a glass plug is inserted into the end remote from the handle of the hollow soot porous body. The cooled hollow soot porous body 501 is moved into a furnace 601, suspended by the hollow handle 405 in the furnace 601, wherein this hollow soot porous<br>
10 	body 501 is heated at a temperature of about 1050°C in an atmosphere of gases of halogens or compounds thereof to remove the hydroxyl content for a predetermined duration of time. Thereafter the dehydrated hollow soot porous body 501 is sintered to form a glass preform in an atmosphere of gases of halogens or compounds thereof at a temperature of about 1500°C. This step of sintering of hollow soot porous body in to<br>
15      glass is also known as vitrification or consolidation.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates the dehydration and sintering furnace 601 for dehydration and sintering of the hollow soot porous body 501. A glass plug 608 is inserted into the end remote from the handle 405 of the hollow soot porous body 501. The cooled hollow soot<br>
20 	porous body 501 is inserted into dehydration and sintering furnace 601, suspended by the hollow handle 405 in the sintering furnace, wherein this hollow soot porous body 501 is first dehydrated at a temperature of about 1050°C and then sintered (also known as vitrification or consolidation) in a chlorine and helium atmosphere to form optical fiber preform at about 1500°C. The dehydration and sintering is preferably carried out in the<br>
25 	same furnace to avoid contamination of dehydrated hollow soot porous body 501. The dehydration and sintering furnace 601 is specially built for the purpose equipped with one or more heating elements 604 and gas inlets 602 and reaction product-scrubbing outlet 603. The hollow soot porous body 501 is suspended in the dehydration and sintering furnace 601 by the suspension device 607. The dehydration and sintering processes<br>
30	comprise inserting the hollow cylindrical soot porous body 501 into a sintering furnace 601 and subjecting it to a temperature regime under controlled chemical environment to<br>
18     Agent Docket No: BL/PAT/IN/085/001<br><br>
form sintered glass preform sequentially. The chemical environment necessary for dehydration is provided with the help of gases that promote dehydration. The chemical environment that is necessary for sintering is provided with gases that are inert and have high thermal conductivity. The gases are provided through the inlet 602 and scrubbed <br>
5 	through the upper outlet 603. The sintering furnace is covered at the top with a plate 606 that avoids the ingress of atmospheric air into the furnace and leakage of gases inside the furnace into the environment.<br>
The capillary 502 in the hollow soot porous body is collapsed either during the<br>
10     sintering step or after the sintering step. The collapse of the capillary 502 takes place<br>
under vacuum. A tube 609 is attached to the hollow handle 405 and is connected to<br>
vacuum pump. There after the sintered glass preform (also called as mother preform),<br>
after removal from the sintering furnace 601 is held and transferred to the rod draw<br>
furnace by using the mechanism of the present invention for holding the optical fiber<br>
15     preform and precursors thereof without need for cooling down to room temperature,<br>
(Figure 2), wherein it is subjected to a process step of rod draw to form a plurality of core<br>
rods having predetermined diameter. Optical fiber can also be drawn from the mother<br>
preform at this stage. In this case the mother preform is held and transferred to the optical<br>
fiber drawing furnace, by using the mechanism for loading and holding the hot optical<br>
20     fiber preform and the precursors thereof of the present invention to the optical fiber, in<br>
hot condition without need for cooling down to room temperature.<br>
Figure 7 depicts the core rod assembly 701 prepared by heat welding glass handles 702 to both the ends of core rod 703 obtained by drawing mother preform. The<br>
25 	core rod assembly is subjected to a step of over cladding thereafter. The core rod assembly 701 after preparation is hot and can be held and transferred to the deposition machine, similar to the deposition machine 407, for overcladding the core rod assembly, by using the mechanism for loading and holding the hot optical fiber preform and precursors thereof of the present invention.<br>

The core rod assembly 701 is placed inside the deposition machine, wherein soot is deposited onto the core rod assembly 701 using burners similar to that used for preparation of mother perform to form soot porous body 801 (Figure 8). This step of depositing soot over the core rod is called overcladding. The soot porous body 804 <br>
5 	formed is then removed from the deposition machine, without need for cooling down to room temperature, it is held and transferred, using the mechanism for loading and holding the hot optical fiber preform and precursors thereof of the present invention, to a dehydration and sintering furnace similar to that for dehydration and sintering hollow soot porous body. The temperature of the dehydration is about 1200°C and that of <br>
10     sintering is about 1550°C.<br>

as daughter preform. Again without need for cooling down to room temperature, it is held<br>
and transferred to the optical fiber draw furnace using the mechanism for loading and<br>
15     holding the hot optical fiber preform and the precursors thereof of the present invention,<br>
to draw optical fiber therefrom.<br>

20 	fiber preform and precursors thereof, safely and can also be transferred from one stage to another or from one stage to the storage and transportation device of US' 613, though at every stage of the optical fiber preform manufacturing process the temperature of the optical fiber preform and the precursors thereof is high, typically the temperature is in the range of about 800°C to about 1600°C or more.<br>
