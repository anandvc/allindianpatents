				<td> The present invention relates to a bis(thiohydrazide amide compound.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Many new drugs are now available to be used by oncologists in treating patients with cancer. Often, tumors are more responsive to treatment when antiÂ¬cancer drugs are administered in combination to the patient than when the same drugs are administered individually and sequentially. One advantage of this approach is that the anti  cancer agents often act synergistically because the tumors cells are attacked simultaneously with agents having multiple modes of action. Thus, it is. often possible to achieve more rapid reductions in tumor size by administering these drugs in combination. Another advantage of combination chemotherapy is that tumors are more likely to be eradicated cpmpletely and are less likely to develop resistance to the anti-cancer dnigs being used to treat the patient.<br>
One serious limitation of combination chemotherapy is that anti-cancer agents generally have severe side effects, even when administered individually. For example, the well known anti-cancer agent taxol causes neutroperia, neuropathy, mucositis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, bradycardia, diarrhea and nausea. Unfortunately, the toxicity of anti-cancer agents is generally additive when the drugs are administered in combination. As result, certain types of anti-cancer drugs are generally not combined. The combined toxic side-effects of those anti-cancer drugs that are administered simultaneously can place severe limitations on the quantities that can be used in combination. Often, it is not possible to use enough of the combination therapy to achieve the desired synergistic effects. Therefore, there is an urgent need for agents which can enhance the desirable tumor attacking properties of anti-cancer agents without further increasing their undesirable side-effects.<br><br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has now been found that certain bis[thio-hydrazide amide] compounds significantly enhance the anti-cancer activity of taxol. For example, Compound (1) was used in combination with taxol (Paclitaxel) to treat tumors induced in nude mice from the human breast tumor cell line MDA-435. The tumor volume was about five fold less after 24 days of treatment in mice which had been administered 5 mg/kg of taxol and 25 mg/kg of Compound (1) than in mice which had only been administered 5 mg/kg of taxol or in mice which had only been administered 50 mg/kg of Compound (1) (Example 7). These results are shown graphically in Figure 1. The structure of Compound (1) is shown below:<br><br>
(Figure Remove) Compound (1)<br>
It has also been found that these bisfthio-hydrazide amide] compounds have minimal toxic side effects. For example, the mice treated with taxol and Compound (1) showed little if any weight loss over the treatment period (see Figure 2). Based on these results, novel compounds which enhance the anti-cancer activity of taxol, pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds and methods of treating a subject with cancer are disclosed herein.<br>
One embodiment of the present invention is a compound represented by the Structural Formula (I):<br>
(Figure Remove) Y is a covalent bond, a phenylene group or a substituted or unsubstituted straight chained hydrocarbyl group. In addition, Y, taken together with both &gt;C=Z groups to which it is bonded, is a substituted or unsubstituted aromatic group. Preferably, Y is a covalent bond or -C(R7Rg)-.<br>
RI is an aliphatic group, a substituted aliphatic group, a non-aromatic heterocyclic group, or a substituted non-aromatic heterocyclic group.<br>
R2-R4 are independently -H, an aliphatic group, a substituted aliphatic group, a non-aromatic heterocyclic group, a substituted non-aromatic heterocyclic group, an aryl group or a substituted aryl group, or Rj and Ra taken together with the carbon and nitrogen atoms to which they are bonded, and/or R? and R4 taken together with the carbon and nitrogen atoms to which they are bonded, form a non-aromatic heterocyclic ring optionally fused to an aromatic ring.<br>
R5-Rg are independently -H, an aliphatic group, a substituted aliphatic group, an aryl group or a substituted aryl group.<br>
Ry and RS are each independently -H, an aliphatic or substituted aliphatic group, or Ry is -H and Rg is a substituted or unsubstituted aryl group, or, RY and RS, taken together, are a C2-C6 substituted or unsubstituted alkylene group. Zis=Oor=S.<br>
In one aspect RI and R2 in the compound represented by Structural Formula (I) are not both Cl -C5 alkyl (preferably not both methyl) when Y is -C(R7R8)- RS and R4 are both phenyl and Rs-Rg are all -H.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent and a compound represented by Structural Formula (I). Preferably, the pharmaceutical composition comprises an effective concentration of the compound.<br>
Yet another embodiment of the present invention is a method of treating a subject with cancer. The method comprises administering to the subject an effective amount of taxol or a taxol analog and an effective amount of a compound represented by Structural Formula (I).<br>
The disclosed compounds increase the anti-cancer activity of taxol and taxol analogs. In addition, these compounds have minimal toxic side-effects. Consequently, it is possible to increase the effectiveness of taxol and analogs thereof when used in combination with the disclosed compounds, even when approaching the highest tolerated doses of taxol. Thus, it is expected that combination therapy with the compounds of the present invention will provide improved clinical outcomes for patients with cancers that are being treated with taxol. By co-administering the disclosed compounds with taxol, it is also possible to achieve the same therapeutic effectiveness previously achieved with higher doses of taxol, thereby reducing the side-effects and improving the quality of life for the patient<br>

An aliphatic group is preferably a straight chained or branched alkyl group, e.g, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, zso-propyl, Â»-butyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyL, pentyl, hexyl, pentyl or octyl, or a cycloalkyl group with 3 to about 8 carbon atoms, e.g, cyclopropyl, clobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, or cyclooctyl. A C1-C20 straight chained or branched alkyl group or a C3-C8 cyclic alkyl group is also referred to as a "lower alkyl" group.<br>
Aromatic groups include carbocyclic aromatic groups such as phenyl, naphthyl, and anthracyl, and heteroaryl groups such as imidazolyl, thienyl, furanyl,<br><br>
pyridyl, pyrimidy, pyranyl, pyrazolyl, pyrroyl, pyrazinyl, thiazole, oxazolyl, and tetrazole.<br>

The term "arylene" refers to an aryl group which is connected to the remainder of the molecule by two other bonds. By way of example, the structure of a 1,4-phenylene group is shown below:<br>
(Figure Remove) Substituents for an arylene group are as described below for an aryl group.<br>
Non-aromatic heterocyclic rings are non-aromatic carbocyclic rings which include one or more heteroatoms such as nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur in the ring. The ring can be five, six, seven or eight-membered. Examples include tetrahydrofuranyl, tetrahyrothiophenyl, morpholino, thiomorpholino, pyrrolidinyl, piperazinyl, piperidinyl, and thiazolidinyl.<br>

Also included in the present invention are pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds described herein. The compound of the present invention which possess a sufficiently acidic, a sufficiently basic, or both functional groups, and accordingly can react with any of a number of inorganic bases, and inorganic and organic acids, to form a salt. Acids commonly employed to form acid addition salts are inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like, and organic acids such as p-toluenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, oxalic acid,/?-bromophenyl-sulfonic acid, carbonic acid, succinic acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, acetic acid, and the like. Examples of such salts include the sulfate, pyrosulfate, bisulfate, sulfite, bisulfite, phosphate, monohydrogenphosphate, dihydrogenphosphate, metaphosphate, pyrophosphate, chloride, bromide, iodide, acetate, propionate, decanoate, caprylate, acrylate, formate, isobutyrate, caproate, heptanoate, propiolate, oxalate, maloxaate, succinate, suberate, sebacate, fumarate, maleate, buryne-l,4-dioate, hexyne-1,6-dioate, benzoate, chlorobenzoate, methylbenzoate, dinitrobenzoate, hydroxybenzoate, methoxybenzoate, phthalate, sulfonate, xylenesulfonate, phenylacetate, phenylpropionate, phenylbutyrate, citrate, lactate, gamma-<br><br>

Such bases useful in preparing the salts of this invention thus include sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, and the like.<br>
Taxol, also referred to as "Paclitaxel", is a well-known anti-cancer drug which acts by inhibiting microtubule formation. Many analogs of taxol are known, including taxotere, the structure of which is shown in Figure 4. Taxotere is also referred to as ""Docetaxol". The structure of other taxol analogs are shown in Figures 5-25. These compounds have the basic taxane skeleton as a common structure feature and have also been shown to have the ability to arrest cells in the G2-M phases due to stabilized microtubules. Thus, it is apparent from Figures 5-25 that a wide variety of substituents can decorate the taxane skeleton without adversely affecting biological activity. It is also apparent that zero, one or both of the cyclohexane rings of a taxol analog can have a double bond at the indicated positions. For clarity purposes, the basic taxane skelton is shown below in Structural<br>
(Figure Remove) <br>
Double bonds have been omitted from the cyclohexane rings in the taxane skeleton represented by Structural Formula (VII). It is to be understood that the basic taxane skeleton can include zero or one double bond in one or both cyclohexane rings, as indicated in Figures 5-25 and Structural Formulas (VIII) and (IX) below. A number of atoms have also omitted from Structural Formula (VTI) to indicate sites in which structural variation commonly occurs among taxol analogs. For example, substitution on the taxane skeleton with simply an oxygen atom indicates that<br><br>
hydroxyl, acyl, alkoxy or other oxygen-bearing substituent is commonly found at the site. It is to be understood that these and other substitutions on the taxane skeleton can also be made without losing the ability to enhance and stabilize microtubule formation. Thus, the term "taxol analog" is defined herein to mean a compound which has the basic taxol skeleton and which promotes disassembly of microtubules. Typically, the taxol analogs used herein are represented by Structural<br>

A taxol analog can also be bonded to or be pendent from a pharmaceutically acceptable polymer, such as a polyacrylamide. One example of a polymer of this type is shown in Figure 26. The term "taxol analog", as it is used herein, includes such polymers.<br>
The disclosed compounds are enhancers of the anti-cancer activity of taxol and taxol analogs. A compound enhances the anti-cancer activity of taxol or a taxol<br><br>
analog when the activity of taxol or the taxol analog is greater when administered in combination with the compound than when administered alone. The degree of the increase in activity depends upon the amount of compound administered. The compounds of the present invention can therefore be used in combination with taxol or taxol analogs to treat subjects with cancers. Examples include colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, melanoma, renal cancer, sarcoma, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, stomach cancer, bladder cancer and cervical cancer.<br>
A "subject" is a mammal, preferably a human, but can also be an animal in need of veterinary treatment, e.g., companion animals (e.g., dogs, cats, and the like), farm animals (e.g., cows, sheep, pigs, horses, and the like) and laboratory animals (e.g., rats, mice, guinea pigs, and the like).<br>
In order to achieve an enhancement of the anti-cancer activity of taxol and taxol analogs, an effective amount of a compound of the present invention and an effective amount of taxol or analog of taxol are administered to the subject. With respect to taxol or an analog of taxol, an "effective amount" is a quantity in which anti-cancer effects are normally achieved. With respect to a compound of the present invention, an "effective amount" is the quantity in which a greater anti-cancer effect is achieved when the compound is co-administered with taxol or a taxol analog compared with when taxol or the taxol analog is administered alone. The compound and taxol (or taxol analog) can be co^dSi^Hiistered to the subject as part of the same pharmaceutical composition or, alternatively, as separate pharmaceutical compositions. When,administered as separate pharmaceutical compositions, the compound or the present invention and taxol (or taxol analog) can be administered simultaneously or at different times, provided that the enhancing effect of the compound is retained.<br>
The amount of compound and taxol (or taxol analog) administered to the subject will depend on the type and severity of the disease or condition and on the characteristics of the subject, such as general health, age, sex, body weight and tolerance to drugs. It will also depend on the degree, severity and type of cancer. The skilled artisan will be able to detennine appropriate dosages depending on these and other factors. Effective dosages for taxol and taxol analog are well known and typically range from between about 1 mg/rnm2 per day and about 1000 mg/mm2 per day, preferably between about 10 mg/mm2 per day and about 500 mg/mm2 per day. Effective amounts of a compound of the present invention typically range between about 1 mg/mm2 per day and about 10 grams/mm2 per day, and preferably between 10 mg/mm" per day and about 5 grams/mm2.<br><br>
The disclosed compounds are administered by any suitable route, including, for example, orally in capsules, suspensions or tablets or by parenteral administration. Parenteral administration can include, for example, systemic administration, such as by intramuscular, intravenous, subcutaneous, or intraperitoneal injection. The compounds can also be administered orally (e.g., dietary), topically, by inhalation (e.g., intrabronchial, imtanasal, oral inhalation or intranasal drops), or rectally, depending on the type of cancer to be treated. Oral or parenteral administration are preferred modes of administration. Suitable routes of administration of taxol and taxol analogs are well known in the art and include by parenteral administration, as described above for the compounds of the present invention. Suitable routes of administration for taxol and analogs thereof are well known and include inter alia parenteral and oral administration.<br>
The disclosed compounds can be administered to the subject in conjunction with an acceptable pharmaceutical carrier as part of a pharmaceutical composition for treatment of cancer. Formulation of the compound to be administered will vary according to the route of administration selected (e.g., solution, emulsion, capsule). Suitable pharmaceutical carriers may contain inert ingredients which do not interact with the compound. Standard pharmaceutical formulation techniques can be employed, such as those described in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, PA. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers for parenteral administration include, for example, sterile water, physiological saline, bacteriostatic saline (saline containing about 0.9% mg/ml benzyl alcohol), phosphate-buffered saline, Hank's solution, Ringer's-lactate and the like. Methods for encapsulating compositions (such as in a coating of hard gelatin or cyclodextrasn) are known in the art (Baker, et al, "Controlled Release of Biological Active Agents", John Wiley and Sons, 1986).Suitable formulations for taxol and taxol analogs are well known in the art,<br>
The disclosed compounds can be prepared according to methods described in Examples 1-12 and also according to methods described in the co-pending US Provisional Application entitled SYNTHESIS OF TAXOL ENHANCERS, U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/304,318, filed July 10, 2001.

Compound (1) Enhances the Anti-Cancer Activity of Paclitaxel in vivo (Human xenograft model: Human Breast Carcinoma MDA-435 in nude mice)<br>
General Procedure of in vivo Anti-Tumor Study<br>
The in vivo anti-cancer enhancing effect of novel compounds was assessed in tumor bearing mice using the tumor growth inhibition assay. Tumor cells were implanted by injection of a tumor cell suspension subcutaneously in the flank of a mouse. Treatment of the tumor with an experimental compound and Paclitaxel began after the tumor had been established (volume was about 150 mm3). Animal then begun a multiple injection schedule where the compound and Paclitaxel were given by IV route of administration. Tumors were measured two times a week. During the course of this assay, animals were monitored daily for signs of toxicity including body weight loss.<br>
s<br>
Detailed Procedure of MDA-435 (Human Breast Carcinoma) Anti-Tumor Study A supplemented media was prepared from 50% DMEM/Dulbecco Modified Eagle Medium (High Glucose), 50% RPMI1640, 10% FBS/Fetal Bovine Serum (Hybridoma Tested; Sterile Filtered), 1% L-Glutamine, 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin, 1%MEM Sodium Pyruvate and 1% MEM Non-Essential Amino Acids. FBS was obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. and other ingredients were obtained from Invitrogen Life   y. Technologies, USA). The supplemental media was warmed to 37Â° C and 50 ml of media was added to a 175 cm2 tissue culture flask.<br>
The cells used in the assay were MDA-435 Human Breast Carcinoma from the American Type Culture Collection. 1 vial of MDA-435 cells from the liquid nitrogen frozen cell stock was removed. The frozen vial of cells was immediately placed into a 37Â° C water bath and gently swirled until thawed. The freeze-vial was wiped with 70% ethanol and cells were immediately pipetted into the 175 cm2 tissue culture flask containing supplemented media. The cells were incubated overnight and the media was<br><br>
removed and replaced with fresh supplemented media the next day. The flask was incubated until flask became about 90% confluent. This took anywhere from 5-7 days.<br>
The flask was washed with 10 ml of sterile room temperature phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The cells were trypsinized by adding 5 ml of warmed Trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen) to the flask of cells. The cells were then incubated for 2-3 minutes at 37Â° C until cells begun to detach from the surface of the flask. An equal volume of supplemented media (5 ml) was added to the flask. All the cells were collected into 50 ml tube, and centrifuged at 1000 RPM for 5 minutes at 20Â° C. The supernatant was aspirated and the cell pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of supplemented media and the cells were counted. 1-3 million cells/flask were seeded into 5-7 tissue culture flasks (175 cm2). Each flask contained 50 ml of supplemented media. The flasks were incubated until about 90% confluent. The passaging of the cells was repeated until enough cells have been grown for tumor implantation.<br>
The above procedure for trypsinizing and centrifuging the cells were followed. The supernatant was aspirated and the cell pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of sterile PBS and the cells were counted. The cells were centrifuged and then resuspended with appropriate volume of sterile PBS for injection of correct number of cells needed for tumor implantation. In the case of MDA-435, 100 million cells were suspended with 2.0 ml of sterile PBS to a final concentration of 50 million cells/ml in order to inject 5 million cells in 0.1 ml/mouse.<br>
Mice (CD-I nu/nu) were obtained from Charles River Laboratories: nomenclature: Crl:CD-l-nuBR, Age: 6-8 weeks. The mice were allowed to acclimate for 1 week prior to their being used in an experimental procedure.<br>
Implantation of the MDA-435 rumor cell suspension took place into the corpus adiposum of the female CD-I nu/nu mouse. This fat body is located in the ventral abdominal viscera of the mouse. Tumor cells were implanted subcutaneously into the fat body located in the right quadrant of the abdomen at the juncture of the os coxae (pelvic bone) and the os femoris (femur). 5 million MDA-435 cells in 0.1 ml of sterile PBS were injected using 27 G (1/2 inch) needle. MDA-435 tumors developed 2-3 weeks after implantation.<br>
Compound stock solutions were prepared by dissolving the compound in a 50:50 mixture of EtOH and Cremophor EL (Polyoxyl 35 Castor Oil, BASF, Germany). This stock solution in 50%EtOH / 50%CrEL was sonicated in an ultrasonic water bath until all the powder dissolved.<br>
Preparation of Dosing Solution for Compound Administration: The compound stock solution was diluted 1:10 with D5W (5% Dextrose in Water, Abbott Laboratories, USA). : 1) 2.0 ml of 2.5 mg/ml dosing solution of Compound (1) was prepared by<br><br>
diluting 0.2 ml of a 25 nag/ml Compound Stock solution with 1.8 ml of 100% D5W; and 2) a dosing solution comprising of 1.5 mg/ml of Paclitaxel (obtained from Sigma Chemical Co.) and 2.5 mg/ml of Compound (1) was obtained by mixing 0.2 ml of a 50%EtOH/ 50% CrEL stock solution containing 25 mg/ml of Compound (1) and 15 mg/ml of Paclitaxel with 1.8 ml of a 100% D5W solution. The final formulation for the dosing solution was 5% EtOH, 5% CrEL, 4.5 % Dextrose, and 85.5% water.<br>
The Dosing Solution (Dosing Volume: 0.01 ml/gram = 10 ml/ kg) was injected intravenously into the mice bearing MDA-43 5 human breast tumor.<br>
