METHOD AND DEVICE FOR TREATING WATER<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to the production of highly purified water for special purposes. Particu-<br>
larly, the invention relates to the production of purified water using falling-film evaporators<br>
with subsequent condensation.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
For the purpose of this text, "purified water" means generally water of greater purity than<br>
ordinary potable water available from e.g. a municipal water distribution system. Highly pu-<br>
rified water is required e.g. for various medical purposes, such as production of pharmaceuti-<br>
cals, and in the production of "water for injection", the quality of which is defined in official<br>
pharmacopoeias. Plants for producing such purified water may be designed as so-called<br>
multi-effect stills, employing a series of falling film evaporators. A falling film evaporator<br>
comprises a vertical bundle of evaporation tubes enclosed into a heating jacket. Water fed<br>
into the evaporating tubes at their upper end flows down the inner surface of the tubes,<br>
thereby evaporating and forming steam, which emerges at the lower ends of the tube bundle<br>
together with any un-vaporized water. In many devices for producing highly purified steam<br>
or water, the flow of steam makes a 180° turn and flows upwards in a rising space provided<br>
therefore, while the remaining water collects at the bottom of the device.<br>
The upward-flowing steam may, depending on the type of device, undergo various kinds of<br>
demisting and/or purification operations, whereby the separated droplets and impurities fi-<br>
nally join the water phase at the bottom of the effect while the steam enters the heating jacket<br>
of the subsequent effect. The water phase becomes the feed water of the subsequent effect<br>
and the steam condenses, giving off its heat to cause more steam to evaporate from the feed<br>
water, and the cascade continues until the last effect is reached. The combined condensates<br>
from the heating jackets, together with the steam from the last effect, are cooled and con-<br>
densed, respectively, in a final heat exchanger to form the purified product water.<br>
In prior art multi-effect falling-film plants for producing purified water, the feed to each ef-<br>
fect generates a steam phase and a residual leaving water phase. The residual water phase<br>
then, in its entirety, generates the feed for the next effect and so on, until the last effect is<br>
reached. The residual water in the last effect represents the reject fraction containing the im-<br>
purities.<br>

WO 2004/101440	PCT/FI2004/000292<br>
2<br>
In this context, a reject stream Is a stream of water, which is permanently removed from<br>
the process. Generally, the reject stream is liquid water, but may be a steam-liquid mixture.<br>
A continuous process for producing pure water by evaporation must include the removal of'<br>
a sufficient amount of reject water to carry away the separated impurities. The ratio of re-<br>
ject water to product water is an important aspect of the efficiency of the process. It fol-<br>
lows from the material balance, that if the reject stream is insufficient, the impurities either<br>
accumulate in the device or leave with the product, which both alternatives are highly un-<br>
desirable.<br>
In. Finnish patent application 20021538, a unit for producing pure steam is disclosed. This<br>
device includes a particular purification section for the steam, having a rising spiral path<br>
following the evaporation section, which is a falling-film unit as described above. In the<br>
outer wall of the spiral path, apertures are provided, and outside said apertures a cool sur-<br>
face. This arrangement creates a pressure gradient across the apertures due to condensation<br>
of steam on the cool surface, causing impurity-containing droplets to migrate through the<br>
apertures and collect on the cool surface. The least pure component of the rising stream in<br>
the spiral path thus travels to the periphery and leaves through the apertures, condenses on<br>
the cool surface and forms a water phase rich in impurities, which flows down the cool<br>
surface. This water phase rich in impurities may be isolated and not returned to the proc-<br>
ess, but separated as a reject stream.<br>
In Japanese patent 10328501, a two-effect falling film evaporator is disclosed having a<br>
centrifugal demister adapted to the second effect. The steam phase from the first effect<br>
enters the demister, droplets are separated and form a stream, which can be discharged or<br>
conducted to the pipe transferring the liquid phase from the first to the second effect. The<br>
demisted steam phase enters the heating side of the second effect.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to the production of purified water in a multi-effect still or<br>
evaporation plant utilizing the type of devices described above for purified steam produc-<br>
tion. A falling-film evaporation plant for the production of purified water may comprise a<br>
plurality of evaporation stages or effects. Water is fed to each effect, and water and steam<br>
leaves each effect. According to the present invention, a reject stream is withdrawn from<br>
each effect. Thus, each effect in a multi-effect falling-film evaporation plant for producing<br><br>
      WO 2004/101440	PCT/FI2004/000292<br>
3<br>
purified water comprises means for the withdrawal of a reject stream. £1 one embodiment<br>
of the present invention, the reject stream may be withdrawn as liquid water from the frac-<br>
tion of water that is not vaporized in an evaporation section, i.e. the residual water. A frac-<br>
tion of the residual water phase may thus be split offbefore it is conducted to the subse-<br>
quent effect.<br>
According to a preferable embodiment, each effect as a physical unit comprises a rising<br>
channel for the steam phase generated in the effect, and means for separating an impurity-<br>
containing fraction from the rising steam. The "steam phase" in this context is a water va-<br>
por phase in the vicinity of its saturation point, and thus generally contains minute water<br>
droplets. The impurity-containing fraction, which may thus comprise steam and water<br>
droplets, is permanently separated from the process and not passed on to the next effect.<br>
Preferably, the fraction is essentially allowed to condense to be withdrawn in the form of<br>
liquid water.<br>
Thus, the effect units all comprise the same components, i.e. falling-film heat transfer<br>
channels, water phase collection compartment, steam phase rising channel with droplet<br>
separator, and collection compartment for the separated droplets.<br>
The present invention provides several advantages, particularly in the embodiment de-<br>
scribed above. The total amount of reject water is decreased, as a smaller proportion is<br>
required to carry impurities. A greater proportion of water can be evaporated in each effect,<br>
compared to the prior art. The impurities separated from the feed in each effect are not<br>
carried over to the next effect, and do not come into contact with heat exchange surfaces<br>
further downstream. Scaling is thus avoided. The recycling of the residual water from the<br>
last effect is also made feasible, as this fraction does not contain such an increased level of<br>
impurities as in the prior art.<br>
Brief description of the drawing<br>
The invention is more thoroughly disclosed in the following, with reference to the ap-<br>
pended figure, which schematically shows the main components of a plant according to the<br>
invention.<br><br>
WO 2004/101440	PCT/FI2004/000292<br>
4<br>
Disclosure of the invention<br>
Figure 1 shows an embodiment of a four-effect production plant for pure water according<br>
to the invention. Feed water, preferably purified by means of filtering and ion exchange or<br>
other appropriate methods, enters at inlet 1. After passing heat recovery exchanger 4, the<br>
feed stream enters, through transfer line 5, the first falling-film evaporation unit 6. Transfer<br>
line 5 may be provided with additional heat exchange devices to improve the overall heat<br>
recovery, as the person skilled in the art may contemplate.<br>
Plant steam or another primary heat transfer medium entering at inlet 8 heats the shell side<br>
of the falling film evaporation section 7. As the feed water flows down as a film on the<br>
inner walls of the evaporating tubes (not shown), the water partly evaporates into steam,<br>
which emerges from the lower end of the tubes together with the remaining water. Within<br>
separation section 9, the steam makes a 180° turn and enters a rising channel. After passing<br>
the rising channel, the steam is led through transfer line 10 to the shell side of the falling<br>
film evaporation unit of the subsequent effect 11. The water phase collects on the bottom<br>
i<br>
of the effect, leaves the effect at outlet 2 and is conducted to the feed inlet 12 of the subse-<br>
quent effect. A reject stream is withdrawn via conduit 13.<br>
In each evaporation effect* the same sequence occurs. Feed water is partially evaporated to<br>
steam in the falling film section. The steam generated in each effect is carried over to heat<br>
the feed water in the subsequent effect, and the residual water that has not been converted<br>
into steam becomes the feed water of the next effect. The residual water from the last ef-<br>
fect may be discarded or recycled.<br>
In an embodiment of separation section 9, disclosed in greater detail in Finnish patent ap-<br>
plication 20021538 referred to above, the rising channel for steam generated in each effect<br>
has the form of a spiral pathway, causing the impurity-containing droplets entrained in the<br>
steam to travel to the periphery of the spiral, where they migrate through apertures in the<br>
outer wall of the rising channel. Outside the apertures, the droplets, along with steam, con-<br>
dense on a surface having a temperature sufficiently low for this to occur. The water film<br>
forming on this surface, containing the separated impurities, flows down by gravity and the<br>
water is collected in a separate, isolated shell space, from where a reject stream is with-<br>
drawn.<br><br>
      WO 2004/101440	PCT/FI2004/000292<br>
5<br>
Thus, in an embodiment of this type having means for separating a fraction of the gener-<br>
ated steam, the steam in each effect is depleted of a contaminant-enriched fraction in the<br>
corresponding separation section; these fractions are isolated in separate compartments and<br>
form reject streams, exiting via conduits 13 in Fig.l. Preferably, the reject lines are pro-<br>
vided with steam traps 16. As impurities are removed from all effects from the first on-<br>
wards, they are not accumulated in the final residual water as in the prior art.<br>
The stream leaving the shell side of the falling film section of the first effect is commonly<br>
factory steam condensate, and is removed at outlet 3. The primary heat source can also be<br>
another heat transfer medium, whereby appropriate re-circulation is provided, or electrical<br>
heating elements.<br>
Beginning from the second effect, the condensate from the shell side of the falling film<br>
section, which condensate stems from the evaporated part of the initial feed water, is col-<br>
lected and fed to the shell side of the falling film section of the next effect. Thus, the<br>
evaporated fractions are finally combined in the shell of the final effect, from which they<br>
are taken out and cooled in a heat exchanger 4 together with the steam phase of the final<br>
effect. Preferably, this heat exchanger delivers heat to the initial feed water stream.<br>
The temperature and pressure conditions in the individual effects are adjusted as required.<br>
In the first effect, the temperature corresponds to that of the primary heating medium, re-<br>
sulting in a corresponding steam pressure. Throttle devices may be provided between ef-<br>
fects, and the pressure decreases sequentially until preferably being near atmospheric in the<br>
final effect.<br>
From the last effect, a residual water phase is withdrawn at outlet 15 and may be discarded<br>
as an additional reject stream, recycled, or split between these.<br><br>
