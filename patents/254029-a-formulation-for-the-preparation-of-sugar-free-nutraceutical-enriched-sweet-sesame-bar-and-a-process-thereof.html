				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a formulation for the preparation of sugar free nutraceutical enriched sweet sesame bar and a process thereof.<br>
The product is a ready-to-eat confection could be consumed by all sections of population.<br>
Indian traditional sweets based on sesame are popular and. ready to eat, which are stable and hard boiled confections prepared using either jaggery or sugar as base and roasted white sesame. Some of these products are crunchy, hard and crisp in texture and are traditionally prepared by boiling jaggery or sugar syrup to hard crack stage, mixing with sesame, sheeting and cutting.<br>
Traditional sweets occupy an important position in India and are popular through out the country. These sweets are the major consumer of sugar in the country and its consumption is very large. Due to health consciousness and awareness of the consumer, the demand for low-calorie and low sugar products is increasing. To meet these demands and to provide nutritious, healthy products, it is necessary to develop process for preparation of low or sugar free sweets. For this purpose, alternative sweeteners and appropriate bulking agents are selected to simulate the characteristics of sugar. In that direction, sweet sesame bar without added any sugar is prepared in the present invention.<br>
The present invention replaces sugar or jaggery in the formulation, with a combination of bulking agent, preferably polydextrose along with an intense sweetener to impart desired sweetness. The function of bulking agent, polydextrose is to provide structure or body and binding properties normally provided by sucrose. In the present invention, mannitol, which is crystalline and less hygroscopic compared to other polyols is added as an<br><br>
optional ingredient along with polydextrose, to improve the texture to the product.<br>
In addition to sugar free, the product is enriched with added nutraceuticals in the form of amla (gooseberry) powder, which is known for its health benefits. Amla is a rich source of vitamin C, antioxidants, flavonoids and minerals. It is one of the three constituents of the famous ayurvedic preparations, Triphala, which is prescribed in many digestive disorders and also in Chyawanprash and hence, it imparts and elevates the nutraceutical value of Gajak.<br>
The literature, especially patented, on traditional confectionery with special reference to sesame bars is scanty. However, the relevant patented literature is listed below.<br>
In our earlier work, low sugar, low fat and dietary fiber enriched cereal bar and process for preparation thereof (Reddy and Chetana, 2004),wherein polydextrose is used as a sugar replacer and other ingredients include, puffed rice, nuts, wheat flour, and process consisting of heating polydextrose in presence of water and mixing all the ingredients or by mixing all ingredients followed by warming and then sheeting and baking. Whereas in the present invention the ingredients other than polydextrose include sesame and amla and process is also different, which consists of mixing, sheeting and baking and hence the formulations and process parameters are different from those of the present invention.<br>
Reference may be made to reduced calorie conectionery compositions (Johnson Scott et al, USP Applicationn. 20040086615, 2004), wherein low calorie confectionery composition, consisting of erythritol, fructo-oligosaccharide, isomalt, polydextrose and /or high protein is disclosed. The composition is designed for solid moulding, enrobing, chunks, or chips<br><br>
preparation. The drawbacks of this invention are the composition consists of fructo-oligosaccharides along with other polyols, protein, fat and is prepared like chocolate or chocolate coatings. Hence, the composition and process are different from those of the present invention.<br>
Reference may be made to process for coating sugar-free boiled sweets (Ribadeau-Dumas, USP Application, 20020160083, 2002), wherein sugar-free boiled sweet with a coating syrup comprising one polyol, at least one high molecular weight polysaccharides such as cellulose derivatives, polydextrose, oligosaccharides, hydrogenated maltodextrins, etc. and fat. The composition and process are different from those of the present invention.<br>
Reference may be made to sugar-free chewy products and protein based chewy products and methods for making the same (Cherukuri, Subraman Rao, et al USP Application, 20030026826, 2003), wherein composition comprising of a mixture of at least two polyols, an emulsifier, an active agent.with added colours and flavours, is prepared by mixing, heating to high temperature of above 90C, cooling adding emulsifier, cooling and adding active ingredient. The composition and process are entirely different from those of the present invention, wherein polydextrose is the main sugar replacer and made in the form of bar by mixing and baking.<br>
Reference may be made to reduced fat spreadable corn syrup compositions and methods of preparation thereof (Ethington Reed al USP Application, 20020150665, 2002), wherein low fat spread used in place of butter or margarine comprising fructose syrup, fat, flavourings from natural or synthetic, natural flavouring include from fruits such as lemon, orange, grape, gooseberry, etc. The product is a spread and composition also different from the present invention.<br><br>
Reference may be made to frozen aerated products (Bartkowska et al, USP Application, 20040071835, 2004), wherein frozen aerated product comprising fat 0-20%, milk solids 0.25-20%, soluble dietary fiber 0.05-1.5%, insoluble dietary fiber 0.1-5%, sweetener 0.1-35%, where dietary fiber provided by fruit puree including gooseberry. The product, composition and process are entirely different from those of the present invention.<br>
Reference may be made to chewable tablets containing mannitol and aspartame (Valentine, et al, USP 6,296,868, 2001), wherein chewable tablets made from agglomerates comprising an alcohol sugar such as mannitol and high intensity sweetener such as aspartame from which agglomerate tablets may be directly compressed. The drawbacks of this invention are the process is to prepare sugar free tablets using mannitol and an intense sweetener, which are different from those of the present invention, where bulking agent acts as a binder and sugar replacer with added intense sweetener and product is prepared by baking unlike in this invention.<br>
Diabetic nutritionals and method of using (Gilles, et al, USP 6,248,375, 2001), wherein, the invention is directed to solid matrix designed for diabetics, utilizes fructose in combination with at least on non-absorbent carbohydrates, fructooligosaccharides and microcrystalline cellulose are used and also include dietary fiber and a source of oligosaccharides. The solid matrix is administered to a diabetic in form of cereal, bread, cookies, biscuits, etc. nutritional bar further includes additional nutrients like vitamins and minerals. The drawbacks of this invention are oligosaccharides and cellulose derivatives are used along with fructose, which are different from those of the present invention.<br><br>
Reference may be made to sugar free coating obtained by hard coating and process for producing it (Ribadean Dumas, et al., USP 5,900,261, 1999), wherein hard crystalline coating based on a specific mixture of polyols, having improved crunchiness and an improved process for hard coating based on xylitol, maltitol, or lactitol or mixture thereof is prepared. The drawbacks of this invention are polyols are used as sugar replacers, whereas polydextrose forms the base in the present invention and also the process is entirely different.<br>
Reference may be made to sugarless baked goods, eg., cakes and muffins (USP 5,523,107, 1996), wherein sugar free bakery goods such as cakes, muffins, donuts formed from a batter mixture including 15-25% of starch hydrolysate comprising polyhdroxy oligomers having a degree of polymerization (DP) of 1-3, 10-25% water, 10-20% oil/fat, 0.01% aspartame in addition to other typical ingredients used in forming a dough for baking. The drawbacks of this invention are polyols having different DP used along with starch hydrolysate and is baked, which are entirely different from those of the present invention.<br>
Reference may be made to grainy confectionery product and process for manufacturing the said confectionery product (Ribadeau-Dumas, et al, USP 5,580,601, 1996), wherein appropriate quantity of maltitol or xylitol are used to prepare grainy confections such as fondants. The drawbacks of this invention are only polyols are used to replace sugar and the products are grainy confections, both processes, formulations and products are different from those of the present invention, where sesame is the main ingredient apart from bulking sugar replacer.<br>
Reference may be made to sugar free chocolate coating (Bombardier, et al, USP 5,017,392, 1991), wherein sugar fee chocolate coating for a frozen dairy dessert comprising aspartame, mannitol and polydextrose is<br><br>
prepared. The drawbacks of this invention are sugar free coating apart from the above ingredients, milk solids, chocolate solids, oil used to simulate conventional sugar containing coating; whereas the present invention relates to usage of polydextrose as a binder and sugar replacer and the product is prepared by baking and hence the formulations and process are entirely different from these invention.<br>
Reference may be made to process for the manufacture of sucrose-free dietetic and/or teeth-sparing chocolate (Kerne, et al, USP 4,980,189, 1990), wherein first preparing a sucrose free chocolate crumb and tumbling it with additional cocoa butter in a conche comprising: mixing of sucrose substitute selected from sugar alcohols, isomaltulose, isomalt, leucrose and polydextrose and mixtures thereof with a liquid or solid milk products, heating the mixture, adding chocolate liquor, drying in a vacuum until a powdery crumb is obtained. The formulations and process are entirely different from those of the present invention.<br>
