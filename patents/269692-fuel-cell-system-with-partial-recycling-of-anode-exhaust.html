CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED PATENT APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]	The present application claims benefit of United States provisional<br>
patent application serial number 60/701,976, filed July 25, 2005, which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference in entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The present invention relates generally to the field of fuel cell systems and<br>
more particularly to fuel cell systems with anode exhaust fuel recovery by partial<br>
pressure swing adsorption.<br>
[0003]	Fuel cells are electrochemical devices which can convert energy stored<br>
in fuels to electrical energy with high efficiencies. High temperature fuel cells<br>
include solid oxide and molten carbonate fuel cells. These fuel cells may operate<br>
using hydrogen and/or hydrocarbon fuels. There are classes of fuel cells, such as the<br>
solid oxide regenerative fuel cells, that also allow reversed operation, such that<br>
oxidized fuel can be reduced back to unoxidized fuel using electrical energy as an<br>
input.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0004]	Figures 1, 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D, 3, and 4 are schematic diagrams of the<br>
partial pressure swing adsorption systems of the embodiments of the invention.<br>
[0005]	Figures 5, 6 and 7 are schematic diagrams of fuel cell systems of the<br>
embodiments of the invention.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006]	The embodiments of the invention provide a system and method in<br>
which a high temperature fuel cell stack fuel exhaust stream is separated into two<br>
streams. The first stream is recycled back into the fuel inlet stream of the high<br>
1<br><br>
temperature fuel cell stack. The second stream may be sent to a hydrogen separation<br>
device which separates hydrogen from the fuel exhaust stream. The hydrogen<br>
separation device may be a partial pressure swing adsorption unit, a temperature<br>
swing adsorption unit or an electrochemical pump separation unit, such as a proton<br>
exchange membrane type separation unit. The separated hydrogen may also be<br>
recycled into the fuel inlet stream and/or provided to a hydrogen storage vessel or to a<br>
hydrogen using device, such as a low temperature fuel cell stack used to power a<br>
vehicle. Alternatively, the second stream may be vented or sent to a burner without<br>
additional hydrogen separation. In one aspect of the invention, a low temperature<br>
blower is used to controllably recycle a desired amount of the fuel exhaust stream into<br>
the fuel inlet stream. In this case, the fuel exhaust stream is cooled to a sufficiently<br>
low temperature, such as a temperature below 200 degrees Celsius before being<br>
provided into the low temperature blower. The first four embodiments below<br>
describe the partial pressure swing adsorption unit which may optionally be used to<br>
separate hydrogen from a fuel exhaust stream. The remaining embodiments describe<br>
the systems where the fuel exhaust stream is separated into two streams.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0007]	The first embodiment of the invention provides a four-step partial<br>
pressure swing adsorption (i.e., concentration swing adsorption) cycle for gas<br>
separation, such as for recovering fuel from the fuel (i.e., anode side) exhaust of a<br>
solid oxide fuel cell stack. Two beds packed with an adsorbent material, such as<br>
activated carbon, are used to adsorb carbon dioxide and water (i.e., water vapor) from<br>
the fuel exhaust, allowing hydrogen and carbon monoxide to pass through the beds.<br>
The beds are regenerated, preferably countercurrently, with air dried to modest<br>
relative humidities, such as about 30% to about 50% relative humidity. For example,<br>
dry air for regeneration may be developed in a temperature swing adsorption cycle<br>
using silica gel or activated alumina. Flush steps are used to recover additional<br>
hydrogen and to prevent air from contaminating the recovered fuel. The duration of<br>
the adsorption and regeneration (i.e., feeding and purging) steps is preferably at least<br>
5 times longer, such as 10-50 times longer than the duration of the flush steps.<br>
2<br><br>
[0008]	Thus, a reliable, energy-efficient cycle for optimum gas separation is<br>
provided. For example, the cycle is a high efficiency cycle for maximum recovery of<br>
hydrogen and maximum rejection of carbon dioxide and air, based on a partial<br>
pressure swing adsorption (also referred to herein as concentration swing adsorption)<br>
with countercurrent purge and cocurrent flush steps. Since the beds are preferably<br>
regenerated with air, the sweeping of air left in the bed at the end of regeneration back<br>
into the fuel cell stack is not desirable. Furthermore, at the start of a regeneration<br>
step, the bed taken off stream contains hydrogen in the gas phase. Recovery of this<br>
hydrogen is desirable. The flush steps are used to remove the air left in the bed at the<br>
end of regeneration to prevent providing this air back into the fuel cell stack, and to<br>
provide the hydrogen remaining in the bed at the start of a regeneration step into the<br>
fuel inlet of the fuel cell stack.<br>
[0009]	While the system and method of the first embodiment will be<br>
described and illustrated with respect to an adsorption system which separates carbon<br>
dioxide from the hydrogen in a solid oxide fuel stack fuel exhaust stream, it should be<br>
noted that the system and method of the first embodiment may be used to separate any<br>
multicomponent gas stream that is not part of a fuel cell system or that is part of a fuel<br>
cell system other than a solid oxide fuel cell system, such as a molten carbonate fuel<br>
cell system for example. Thus, the system and method of the first embodiment should<br>
not be considered limited to separation of hydrogen from carbon dioxide. The<br>
adsorbent material in the adsorbent beds may be selected based on the gases being<br>
separated.<br>
[0010]	Figure 1 illustrates a gas separation apparatus 1 of the first<br>
embodiment. The apparatus 1 contains a first feed gas inlet conduit 3, which in<br>
operation provides a feed gas inlet stream. If the apparatus 1 is used to separate<br>
hydrogen from a fuel cell stack fuel exhaust stream, then conduit 3 is operatively<br>
connected to the fuel cell stack anode exhaust. As used herein, when two elements<br>
are "operatively connected," this means that the elements are directly or indirectly<br>
connected to allow direct or indirect fluid flow from one element to the other. The<br>
3<br><br>
apparatus 1 also contains a second purge gas inlet conduit 5, which in operation<br>
provides a purge gas inlet stream.<br>
[0011]	The apparatus contains a third feed gas collection conduit 7, which in<br>
operation collects at least one separated component of the feed gas. If the apparatus 1<br>
is used to separate hydrogen from a fuel cell stack fuel exhaust stream and to recycle<br>
the hydrogen into the fuel inlet of the fuel cell stack, then conduit 7 is operatively<br>
connected to the fuel inlet of the fuel cell stack (i.e., either directly into the stack fuel<br>
inlet or to a fuel inlet conduit which is operatively connected to the stack fuel inlet).<br>
The apparatus also contains a fourth purge gas collection conduit 9, which in<br>
operation collects the feed gas outlet stream during the flush steps and collects the<br>
purge gas outlet stream during feed/purge steps.<br>
[0012]	Thus, if the apparatus 1 is used to separate hydrogen from a fuel cell<br>
stack fuel exhaust stream, then the first conduit 3 comprises a hydrogen, carbon<br>
dioxide, carbon monoxide and water vapor inlet conduit, the second conduit 5<br>
comprises a dry air inlet conduit, the third conduit 7 comprises a hydrogen and carbon<br>
monoxide removal and recycling conduit and the fourth conduit 9 comprises a carbon<br>
dioxide and water vapor removal conduit.<br>
[0013]	The apparatus 1 also contains at least two adsorbent beds 11, 13. The<br>
beds may contain any suitable adsorbent material which adsorbs at least a majority,<br>
such as at least 80 to 95% of one or more desired components of the feed gas, and<br>
which allows a majority of one or more other components to pass through. For<br>
example, the bed material may comprise zeolite, activated carbon, silica gel or<br>
activated alumina adsorbent material. Activated carbon is preferred for separating<br>
hydrogen and carbon monoxide from water vapor and carbon dioxide in a fuel cell<br>
stack fuel exhaust stream. Zeolites adsorb carbon dioxide as well. However, they<br>
adsorb water very strongly, and a very dry gas should be used for regeneration, which<br>
is difficult to obtain. Thus, zeolite beds can preferably, but not necessarily, be used to<br>
separate a gas stream which does not contain water vapor because an apparatus which<br>
uses zeolite beds to separate a water vapor containing gas may experience a slow<br>
degradation of performance.<br>
4<br><br>
[0014]	The apparatus 1 also comprises a plurality of valves which direct the<br>
gas flow. For example, the apparatus may contain three four-way valves with<br>
"double-LL" flow paths: a feed valve 15, a regeneration valve 17 and a product valve<br>
19. The feed valve 15 is connected to the first conduit 3, to the two beds 11,13 and to<br>
the regeneration valve 17 by conduit 21. The regeneration valve 17 is connected to<br>
the second and fourth conduits 5 and 9, respectively, to the feed valve 15 by conduit<br>
21 and to the product valve 19 by conduit 23. The product valve 19 is connected to<br>
the third conduit 7, to the two beds 11,13 and to the regeneration valve 17 by conduit<br>
23. The four-way valves may be used to redirect two flows at a time. Such valves are<br>
available in a wide range of sizes, for example, from A-T Controls, Inc., Cincinnati,<br>
Ohio, USA, (http ://www.a-tcontrols.com). If desired, each 4-way valve may be<br>
replaced by two 3-way valves or four 2-way valves, or by an entirely different flow<br>
distribution system involving a manifold.<br>
[0015]	Thus, the valves 15,17, 19 are preferably operated such that the purge<br>
gas inlet stream is provided into the beds 11, 13 countercurrently with the feed gas<br>
inlet stream during the purge steps and cocurrently with the feed gas inlet stream<br>
during the flush steps. In other words, the first conduit 3 is operatively connected to<br>
the first and the second beds 11, 13 to provide the feed gas inlet stream into the first<br>
and the second beds in a first direction. The second conduit 5 is operatively<br>
connected to the first and the second beds 11,13 through valves 17, 19 such that the<br>
purge gas inlet stream is provided into each of the first and the second beds 11, 13 in a<br>
different direction from the first direction (such as in the opposite direction) during<br>
the first and the second feed/purge steps, and the purge gas inlet stream is provided<br>
into the first and the second beds in the first direction (i.e., the same direction and the<br>
feed gas inlet stream) during the first and the second flush steps.<br>
[0016]	Figures 2A-2D illustrate the steps in the operation cycle of system 1.<br>
Figure 2A shows the apparatus 1 during a first feed/purge step in which the first bed<br>
11 is fed with a feed gas inlet stream, such as the fuel stack fuel exhaust stream, while<br>
the second bed 13 is fed with a purge gas, such as dried air, to regenerate the second<br>
bed 13.<br>
5<br><br>
[0017]	The feed gas inlet stream is provided from conduit 3 through valve 15<br>
into the first adsorbent bed 11. For a feed gas which contains hydrogen, carbon<br>
monoxide, carbon dioxide and water vapor, the majority of the hydrogen and carbon<br>
monoxide, such as at least 80-95% passes through the first bed 11, while a majority of<br>
the carbon dioxide, such as at least 80-95%, and much of the water vapor are<br>
adsorbed in the first bed. The feed gas outlet stream comprising at least one separated<br>
component of the feed gas, such as hydrogen and carbon monoxide, passes through<br>
valve 19 and is collected at a first output, such as the third conduit 7.<br>
[0018]	The purge gas inlet stream, such as dried air, is provided from the<br>
second conduit 5 through valve 17, conduit 23 and valve 19 into a second adsorbent<br>
bed 13. The purge gas outlet stream passes through conduit 21 and valves 15 and 17,<br>
and is collected at a second output, such as the fourth conduit 9.<br>
[0019]	In the first feed/purge step, the valve positions are such that valve 15<br>
directs the feed to the first bed 11 and valve 19 directs the hydrogen product away to<br>
conduit 7. Valve 17 is positioned to sweep dry air counter currently through the<br>
second bed to remove carbon dioxide that was previously adsorbed. Some of the<br>
water in the feed gas steam is adsorbed on the adsorbent material, such as activated<br>
carbon, at the inlet of the first bed 11 and will be removed from the bed 11 when it is<br>
regenerated in a subsequent step. Carbon monoxide will be passed through the first<br>
bed 11 as the carbon dioxide wave advances.<br>
[0020]	Figure 2B illustrates the apparatus 1 in a first flush step which is<br>
conducted after the first feed/purge step. In this step, the feed valve 15 and the<br>
regeneration valve 17 switch flow directions from the prior step, while the product<br>
valve 19 does not.<br>
[0021]	The purge gas inlet stream is provided from conduit 5 through valves<br>
17 and 15 and conduit 21 into the first adsorbent bed 11. Preferably, this purge gas<br>
inlet stream is provided into the first bed 11 in the same direction as the feed gas<br>
stream in the previous step. The purge gas outlet stream, which comprises at least<br>
6<br><br>
one component of the feed gas, such as hydrogen, that was trapped in a void volume<br>
of the first adsorbent bed, is collected at the first output, such as conduit 7.<br>
[0022]	The feed gas inlet stream is provided from conduit 3 through valve 15<br>
into the second adsorbent bed 13. The feed gas outlet stream, which comprises a<br>
portion of the purge gas, such as air, that was trapped in a void volume of the second<br>
bed 13, passes through valves 19 and 17 and conduit 23 and is collected at an output<br>
different from the first output, such as at conduit 9.<br>
[0023]	Thus, in the first flush step, hydrogen trapped in the void volume of the<br>
first bed 11 is swept to product by the entering air and desorbing carbon dioxide. Air<br>
trapped in the void volume of the second bed 13 is purged from the bed 13 by the<br>
entering feed gas. This step improves the overall efficiency of the process by<br>
continuing to recover hydrogen that is trapped from the prior feed step and preventing<br>
air from the prior purge step from contaminating the hydrogen containing product<br>
after the next valve switch. This flush step is short, such as less than 1/5 of the time<br>
of the prior feed/purge step, such as 1/10 to 1/50 of the time of the prior step. For<br>
example, for an about 90 second feed/purge step, the flush step may be about 4<br>
seconds.<br>
[0024]	Figure 2C shows the apparatus 1 during a second feed/purge step<br>
which is conducted after the first flush step. In this step, the second bed 13 is fed with<br>
a feed gas stream, such as the fuel stack fuel exhaust stream, while the first bed 11 is<br>
fed with a purge gas, such as dried air, to regenerate the first bed 11. Thus, in this<br>
step, the flow paths in valves 17 and 19 switch. This step is generally the same as the<br>
first feed/purge step, but with the beds reversed.<br>
[0025]	The feed gas inlet stream is provided from conduit 3 through valve 15<br>
into the second adsorbent bed 13. Preferably the feed gas inlet stream is provided into<br>
the second bed 13 in the opposite (i.e., countercurrent) direction from the direction in<br>
which the purge gas inlet stream is provided into the second bed 13 in the first purge<br>
step. The feed gas outlet stream, which comprises at least one separated component<br>
of the feed gas, such as hydrogen and carbon monoxide, is collected at the first output,<br>
7<br><br>
such as in the third conduit 7. The purge gas inlet stream is provided from conduit 5<br>
through valves 17 and 19 and conduit 23 into the first adsorbent bed 11. Preferably<br>
the purge gas inlet stream is provided into the first bed 11 in the opposite (i.e.,<br>
countercurrent) direction from the direction in which the feed gas inlet stream is<br>
provided into the first bed 11 in the first feed step. The purge gas outlet stream is<br>
collected from the first bed 11 at an output different from the first output, such as at<br>
the fourth conduit 9.<br>
[0026]	Figure 2D illustrates the apparatus 1 in a second flush step which is<br>
conducted after the second feed/purge step. In this step, the feed valve 15 and the<br>
regeneration valve 17 switch flow directions from the prior step, while the product<br>
valve 19 does not. This step is similar to the first flush steps, but with the beds<br>
reversed.<br>
[0027]	The purge gas inlet stream is provided from conduit 5 through valves<br>
17 and 15 and conduit 21 into the second adsorbent bed 13. Preferably, this steam is<br>
provided into the bed 13 in the same direction as the feed gas inlet stream in the prior<br>
two steps. The purge gas outlet stream, which comprises at least one component of<br>
the feed gas, such as hydrogen, that was trapped in a void volume of the second<br>
adsorbent bed 13, is collected at the first output, such as the third conduit 7.<br>
[0028]	The feed gas inlet stream is provided from conduit 3 through valve 15<br>
into the first adsorbent bed 11. The feed gas outlet stream, which comprises a portion<br>
of the purge gas, such as air, that was trapped in a void volume of the first bed 11, is<br>
collected at an output different from the first output, such as at the fourth conduit 9.<br>
Then the first feed/purge step shown in Figure 2A is repeated. In general, the four<br>
steps described above are repeated a plurality of times in the same order.<br>
[0029]	It should be noted the feed gas inlet stream is preferably provided in<br>
each of the first 11 and the second 13 adsorbent beds in the same direction in the steps<br>
described above. In the first and the second flush steps, the purge gas inlet stream is<br>
provided into each of the first and the second adsorbent beds in the same direction as<br>
the feed gas inlet stream direction. In contrast, in the first and the second feed/purge<br>
8<br><br>
steps, the purge gas inlet stream is provided into each of the first and the second<br>
adsorbent beds in a different direction, such as the opposite direction, from the feed<br>
gas inlet stream direction.<br>
[0030]	The countercurrent purge gas inlet stream flow is advantageous<br>
because it is believed that it will reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the hydrogen<br>
product stream compared to a co-current flow during the purge steps. Some water<br>
will adsorb near the inlet of the carbon bed during the feed step. During the purge or<br>
regeneration step, the bed is purged counter currently with dried air. Because<br>
activated carbon is used for adsorption of carbon dioxide and activated carbon does<br>
not adsorb water appreciably at moderately low relative humidities, in order to<br>
prevent accumulation of water in the bed, the regeneration purge only needs to be<br>
dried to a relative humidity of roughly 30 to 50%. During the feed step, carbon<br>
monoxide will be pushed into the product (with the hydrogen) by using the beds<br>
efficiently for carbon dioxide removal (i.e., by advancing the carbon dioxide wave<br>
reasonably far into the beds). The countercurrent regeneration step will reduce the<br>
level of carbon dioxide in the hydrogen stream in comparison to a cocurrent<br>
regeneration step. The dual flush step will maximize both hydrogen recovery and air<br>
rejection from the hydrogen product.<br>
[0031]	As noted above, in the partial pressure swing adsorption method, the<br>
feed gas inlet stream is not pressurized prior to being provided into the first and the<br>
second adsorbent beds. Furthermore, the above four steps are preferably conducted<br>
without external heating of the adsorbent beds.<br>
[0032]	In operation, the first bed 11 performs the following functions. It<br>
receives the feed gas inlet stream from the first conduit 3 and provides at least one<br>
separated component of the feed gas to the third conduit 7 in a first feed/purge step. It<br>
receives the purge gas inlet stream from the second conduit 5 and provides a purge<br>
gas outlet stream, which comprises at least one component of the feed gas that was<br>
trapped in a void volume of the first bed to the third conduit 7 in a first flush step. It<br>
receives a purge gas inlet stream from the second conduit 5 and provides a purge gas<br>
outlet stream to an output different from the third conduit 7, such as the fourth conduit<br>
9<br><br>
9, in a second feed/purge step. It also receives the feed gas inlet stream from the first<br>
conduit 3 and provides a feed gas outlet stream, which comprises a portion of the<br>
purge gas that was trapped in a void volume of the first bed, to at an output different<br>
from the third conduit 7, such as the fourth conduit 9, in a second flush step.<br>
[0033]	In operation, the second bed 13 performs the following functions. It<br>
receives a purge gas inlet stream from the second conduit 5 and provides a purge gas<br>
outlet stream to at an output different from the third conduit 7, such as the fourth<br>
conduit 9, in a first feed/purge step. It receives the feed gas inlet stream from the first<br>
conduit 3 and provides the feed gas outlet stream, which comprises a portion of the<br>
purge gas that was trapped in a void volume of the second bed 13, to an output<br>
different from the third conduit 7, such as the fourth conduit 9, in a first flush step. It<br>
receives the feed gas inlet stream from the first conduit 3 and provides the feed gas<br>
outlet stream comprising at least one separated component of the feed gas to the third<br>
conduit 7 in a second feed/purge step. It also receives the purge gas inlet stream from<br>
the second conduit 5 and provides the purge gas outlet stream, which comprises at<br>
least one component of the feed gas that was trapped in a void volume of the second<br>
bed 13 to the third conduit 7 in a second flush step.<br>
[0034]	Thus, at least a majority of the carbon dioxide and water vapor in the<br>
feed gas inlet stream is adsorbed by the first 11 and the second 13 adsorbent beds<br>
during the first and the second feed/purge steps, respectively. The adsorbed carbon<br>
dioxide and water vapor is removed from the first and the second adsorbent beds by<br>
the purge gas inlet stream during the second and the first feed/purge steps,<br>
respectively. The removed carbon dioxide and water vapor are collected with the<br>
purge gas outlet stream at the second output during the second and the first feed/purge<br>
steps.<br>
[0035]	It is noted that the regeneration (i.e., purging) of the bed will be<br>
accompanied by a cooling of the bed as CO2 desorbs. It is believed that this will shift<br>
adsorption equilibrium to lower partial pressures for CO2 and will slow regeneration.<br>
This and the expanding velocity front during regeneration may be taken into account<br>
in setting the purge gas (i.e., dry air) flow rate. For example, the inlet air volumetric<br>
10<br><br>
flowrate for regeneration may be greater than, such as 1.5 times greater than, the<br>
outlet flowrate of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. It is believed that allowing for<br>
desorption of carbon dioxide during regeneration, the outlet flowrate for regeneration<br>
will exceed the inlet flowrate of the feed.<br>
[0036]	The apparatus 1 may have the following non-limiting features. The<br>
adsorbent bed material preferably comprises activated carbon for hydrogen separation<br>
from the fuel cell stack fuel exhaust. For example, Calgon BPL activated carbon,<br>
6x16 or 4x10 mesh may be used. The beds 11, 13 may be cylindrical beds 2-12<br>
inches in diameter and 1-6 feed long, such as 6 inches in diameter and 3 feet long, for<br>
example, depending on the size of the fuel cell stack and on the flow rate of the gases.<br>
The duration of the feed/purge steps may be more than 1 minute while the duration of<br>
the flush steps may be a few seconds. For example, the feed/purge duration may be 1<br>
to 3 minutes, such as 1.5 minutes, while the flush duration may be 3-5 seconds, such<br>
as 4 seconds.<br>
[0037]	The method of the first embodiment is designed to provide a high<br>
hydrogen recovery (with flush steps), high carbon dioxide separation (with flush and<br>
countercurrent regeneration steps), high degree of air rejection (with flush steps),<br>
regeneration using a purge gas having a relatively low dryness, such as air having 30-<br>
50% relative humidity, low energy requirements, high robustness (i.e., easily tunable<br>
and adaptable to changes in operating conditions), simple operation with few moving<br>
parts, high scalability, and low to moderate capital cost.<br>
[0038]	The dry air for the purge steps may be obtained by any suitable<br>
method. For example, the dry air can easily be achieved using temperature swing<br>
adsorption cycle with water vapor absorbing beds, such as silica gel or activated<br>
alumina beds. Silica gel has a somewhat higher capacity for water than alumina.<br>
However, it will fracture if very dry and contacted with a water mist. If this is likely,<br>
a protective layer of a non-decrepitating silica gel can be used, or activated alumina<br>
can be used.<br>
11<br><br>
[0039]	The temperature swing adsorption cycle uses two beds (i.e., beds other<br>
than beds 11, 13 shown in Figure 1). One bed is used in the adsorption mode while<br>
the other is being regenerated (heated and cooled). The steps in the cycle are as<br>
follows.<br>
[0040]	In a first adsorption step, a working capacity of 10 mol FO/kg of<br>
silica gel can be used. Considering the worst case, the air would be saturated with<br>
water at 30°C. The partial pressure of water in air saturated at 30°C is 0.042 bar. For<br>
example, to produce a dry air flow rate of 144 slpm from this wet air, 0.28 mol/min of<br>
water must be removed. At the designated working capacity, silica gel is consumed at<br>
a rate of 0.028 kg/min. A bed containing 2 kg of silica gel can remain on stream for<br>
72 minutes. Given a specific gravity of silica gel of 0.72 (corresponding to a bulk<br>
density of 45 lb/ft3), the bed will dry 4300 bed volumes of feed during this time (with<br>
12,000 temperature corrected liters of wet feed dried by a bed 2.8 liters in volume).<br>
The dried air is provided through conduit 5 into the apparatus 1.<br>
[0041]	In a second heating step, the bed is heated counter currently with a<br>
warm feed (e.g., 80°C or other suitable moderately warm or hot temperature). The<br>
bed is heated after about 1000 bed volumes have been passed into it. Somewhat more<br>
energy will be required to heat metal parts also.<br>
[0042]	In a third cooling step, the bed is cooled cocurrently (same direction as<br>
adsorption) with the wet air feed. It will take about 800 bed volumes to cool the bed.<br>
This will deposit water at the bed inlet and use up some of the capacity for adsorption,<br>
reducing it to about 3500 bed volumes. While the first bed is undergoing the<br>
adsorption step, the second bed is undergoing heating or cooling steps. While the<br>
second bed is undergoing the adsorption step, the first bed is undergoing heating or<br>
cooling steps.<br>
[0043]	It should be understood that the calculation above is highly<br>
conservative and approximate. It is based on air for regeneration that is available<br>
saturated with water at 30°C. Typically, the air will be drier. The regeneration<br>
requirements for the carbon beds are mild (e.g., 30-50% RH). Indeed, on a cool day<br>
12<br><br>
or a dry day, drying the regeneration air would not be necessary. Also, if the driers<br>
went out of service for a short time, the process would not be endangered.<br>
[0044]	In a second embodiment of the invention, the apparatus 31 operates<br>
with a countercurrent purge but with no flush steps. Figure 3 shows apparatus 31<br>
using a simple cycle with a countercurrent purge but no flush. Two instead of three<br>
four-way valves 15, 17 are used. The apparatus 31 and method of using this<br>
apparatus are otherwise similar to the apparatus 1 and method of the first<br>
embodiment, except that the first and second flush steps are omitted.<br>
[0045]	The advantage of countercurrent purge is that carbon dioxide is<br>
removed from the bed outlet for the feed step, and higher hydrogen purities will<br>
result. But without the flush, about 5% of the hydrogen is not recovered, and air will<br>
somewhat contaminate the hydrogen containing product in conduit 7.<br>
[0046]	In a third embodiment of the invention, the apparatus 41 operates with<br>
a cocurrent purge with the flush steps. Figure 4 shows the apparatus 41 using a<br>
cocurrent purge and flush. It also uses two instead of three four-way valves. The<br>
apparatus 41 and method of the third embodiment in many respects resembles the<br>
apparatus 1 and method of the first embodiment, except that the purge gas inlet stream<br>
is provided into the beds in the purge steps in the same direction as the feed gas inlet<br>
stream in the prior feed steps. The negative aspect of this cocurrent cycle is that any<br>
CO2 left in the bed will be most concentrated near the outlet end for the adsorption<br>
step and will somewhat contaminate the hydrogen containing product provided to<br>
conduit 7.<br>
[0047]	In a fourth embodiment of the invention, the air purge gas is not pre-<br>
dried. In this embodiment, the apparatus may contain two or three carbon dioxide<br>
adsorbing beds. Some three-bed cycles that do not need dried air. For example, a bed<br>
of carbon used for carbon dioxide adsorption will slowly accumulate water from both<br>
the fuel cell stack fuel exhaust and the wet regeneration air. The bed could be used<br>
for many cycles, with decreasing capacity before it is completely regenerated. If<br>
regenerated counter currently, it would last longer than if regenerated cocurrently<br>
13<br><br>
because water deposited during feed steps would be partially removed by the<br>
regenerating air and vice versa. Nevertheless, the bed would accumulate water over<br>
time.<br>
[0048]	In this embodiment, three beds would be used, with two actively<br>
running adsorption and regeneration cycles, as in the first embodiment, while a third<br>
bed is being more thoroughly regenerated by a thermal swing regeneration or by<br>
purging with a dried gas.<br>
[0049]	Furthermore, if atmospheric air were reasonably dry (i.e., RH 
30°C), then the partial pressure adsorption cycle may be used with two beds in exactly<br>
the same configuration as in the first embodiment. The purge gas would not deposit a<br>
significant amount of water on the carbon, and the countercurrent sweep of the air<br>
during regeneration would remove water adsorbed from the fuel cell stack fuel<br>
exhaust feed. Thus, if dry air was available from the atmosphere, then a separate air<br>
drying step is not needed.<br>
[0050]	The fifth, sixth and seventh embodiments of the invention illustrate a<br>
fuel cell system, such as a solid oxide fuel cell system, where the fuel exhaust stream<br>
is separated into two streams and one of the streams is recycled into the fuel inlet<br>
stream. It should be noted that fuel cell systems other than solid oxide fuel cell<br>
systems may also be used.<br>
[0051]	In the system of the fifth embodiment, a portion of the fuel cell stack<br>
fuel exhaust stream is directly recycled into the fuel inlet stream. Another portion of<br>
the fuel cell stack fuel exhaust stream is provided into the partial pressure adsorption<br>
apparatus of any of the first four embodiments, and the separated hydrogen is then<br>
recycled into the fuel inlet stream and/or is provided to a hydrogen storage vessel or<br>
to a hydrogen using device.<br>
[0052]	Figure 5 illustrates a fuel cell system 100 of the fifth embodiment.<br>
The system 100 contains a fuel cell stack 101, such as a solid oxide fuel cell stack<br>
(illustrated schematically to show one solid oxide fuel cell of the stack containing a<br>
ceramic electrolyte, such as yttria or scandia stabilized zirconia, an anode electrode,<br>
14<br><br>
such as a nickel-stabilized zirconia cermet, and a cathode electrode, such as<br>
lanthanum strontium manganite).<br>
[0053]	The system also contains a partial pressure swing adsorption ("PPSA")<br>
unit 1 of any of the first four embodiments comprising a plurality of adsorbent beds<br>
(not shown for clarity). The PPSA unit 1 acts as a regenerative dryer and carbon<br>
dioxide scrubber.<br>
[0054]	The system 100 also contains the first conduit 3 which operatively<br>
connects a fuel exhaust outlet 103 of the fuel cell stack 101 to a first inlet 2 of the<br>
partial pressure swing adsorption unit 1. For example, the first inlet 2 may comprise<br>
the feed valve 15 and/or an inlet to one of the beds 11, 13, shown in Figure 1. The<br>
system 100 also contains the second conduit 5 which operatively connects a purge gas<br>
source, such as a dried or atmospheric air source 6 to a second inlet 4 of the partial<br>
pressure swing adsorption unit 1. The purge gas source 6 may comprise an air<br>
blower or compressor and optionally a plurality of temperature swing cycle<br>
adsorption beds.<br>
[0055]	The system also contains a third conduit 7 which operatively connects<br>
an outlet 8 of the partial pressure swing adsorption unit 1 to the hydrogen storage<br>
vessel or to the hydrogen using device. If desired, the third conduit 7 also operatively<br>
connects an outlet 8 of the partial pressure swing adsorption unit 1 to a fuel inlet 105<br>
of the fuel cell stack 101, as will be described in more detail below. Preferably, the<br>
system 100 lacks a compressor which in operation compresses the fuel cell stack fuel<br>
exhaust stream to be provided into the partial pressure swing adsorption unit 1.<br>
[0056]	The system 100 also contains the fourth conduit 9 which removes the<br>
exhaust from the unit 1. The conduit 9 may be connected to a catalytic burner 107 or<br>
to an atmospheric vent. Optionally, the burner 107 may also be operatively connected<br>
to the stack fuel exhaust outlet 103 to provide a portion of the fuel exhaust stream into<br>
the burner 107 to sustain the reaction in the burner.<br>
[0057]	The system 100 also contains an optional selector valve 108, such as a<br>
multi-way valve, for example a three-way valve. The selector valve 108 has an inlet<br>
15<br><br>
operatively connected to an outlet of the partial pressure swing adsorption unit 1, a<br>
first outlet operatively connected to the hydrogen storage vessel or to the hydrogen<br>
using device, and a second outlet operatively connected to a fuel inlet 105 of the fuel<br>
cell stack 101. In operation, the valve 108 divides the hydrogen containing stream<br>
provided from the PPSA unit 1 into a first stream, which is provided into the<br>
hydrocarbon fuel inlet stream, and a second stream which is provided to the hydrogen<br>
storage vessel or to the hydrogen using device. However, the valve 108 may be<br>
omitted and the system 100 may be configured to provide the entire hydrogen<br>
containing stream into the hydrocarbon fuel inlet stream, or to the hydrogen storage<br>
vessel or to the hydrogen using device, if such optional vessel or device are connected<br>
to the system 100.<br>
[0058]	Preferably, the second outlet of the selector valve 108 is operatively<br>
connected to the fuel inlet conduit 111 of the fuel cell stack 101 via a blower or a heat<br>
driven compressor 109. The device 109 has an inlet which is operatively connected to<br>
the partial pressure swing adsorption unit 1 (via the selector valve 108) and an outlet<br>
which is operatively connected to a fuel inlet 105 of the fuel cell stack 101. For<br>
example, conduit 7 connects the blower or compressor 109 to the unit 1 via the<br>
selector valve 108. In operation, the blower or compressor 109 controllably provides<br>
a desired amount of hydrogen and carbon monoxide separated from a fuel cell stack<br>
fuel exhaust stream into the fuel cell stack fuel inlet stream. Preferably, the device<br>
109 provides the hydrogen and carbon monoxide into a fuel inlet conduit 111 which is<br>
operatively connected to the a fuel inlet 105 of the fuel cell stack 101. Alternatively,<br>
the device 109 provides the hydrogen and carbon monoxide directly into the fuel inlet<br>
105 of the fuel cell stack 101.<br>
[0059]	The system 100 also contains a condenser 113 and water separator 115<br>
having an inlet which is operatively connected to a fuel cell stack fuel exhaust 103<br>
and an outlet which is operatively connected to an inlet 2 of the partial pressure swing<br>
adsorption unit 1. The condenser 113 and water separator 115 may comprise a single<br>
device which condenses and separates water from the fuel exhaust stream or they may<br>
comprise separate devices. For example, the condenser 113 may comprise a heat<br>
16<br><br>
exchanger where the fuel exhaust stream is cooled by a cool counter or co-flow air<br>
stream to condense the water. The air stream may comprise the air inlet stream into<br>
the fuel cell stack 101 or it may comprise a separate cooling air stream. The separator<br>
115 may comprise a water tank which collects the separated water. It may have a<br>
water drain 117 used to remove and/or reuse the collected water.<br>
[0060]	The system 100 also contains a recuperative heat exchanger 121 which<br>
exchanges heat between the stack fuel exhaust stream and the hydrocarbon fuel inlet<br>
stream being provided from the inlet conduit 111. The heat exchanger helps to raise<br>
the temperature of the fuel inlet stream and reduces the temperature of the fuel<br>
exhaust stream so that it may be further cooled in the condenser and such that it does<br>
not damage the humidifier.<br>
[0061]	If the fuel cells are external fuel reformation type cells, then the system<br>
100 contains a fuel reformer 123. The reformer 123 reforms a hydrocarbon fuel inlet<br>
stream into hydrogen and carbon monoxide containing fuel stream which is then<br>
provided into the stack 101. The reformer 123 may be heated radiatively,<br>
convectively and/or conductively by the heat generated in the fuel cell stack 101 (i.e.,<br>
the reformer is thermally integrated with the stack) and/or by the heat generated in an<br>
optional burner/combustor, as described in U.S. Patent Application Serial Number<br>
11/002,681, filed December 2, 2004, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
Alternatively, the external reformer 123 may be omitted if the stack 101 contains cells<br>
of the internal reforming type where reformation occurs primarily within the fuel cells<br>
of the stack.<br>
[0062]	Optionally, the system 100 also contains an air preheater heat<br>
exchanger 125. This heat exchanger 125 heats the air inlet stream being provided to<br>
the fuel cell stack 101 using the heat of the fuel cell stack fuel exhaust. If desired, this<br>
heat exchanger 125 may be omitted.<br>
[0063]	The system 100 also preferably contains an air heat exchanger 127.<br>
This heat exchanger 127 further heats the air inlet stream being provided to the fuel<br>
cell stack 101 using the heat of the fuel cell stack air (i.e., oxidizer or cathode)<br>
17<br><br>
exhaust. If the preheater heat exchanger 125 is omitted, then the air inlet stream is<br>
provided directly into the heat exchanger 127 by a blower or other air intake device.<br>
[0064]	The system may also contain an optional water-gas shift reactor 128.<br>
The water-gas shift reactor 128 may be any suitable device which converts at least a<br>
portion of the water and carbon monoxide in the fuel exhaust stream into free<br>
hydrogen and carbon dioxide. For example, the reactor 128 may comprise a tube or<br>
conduit containing a catalyst which converts some or all of the carbon monoxide and<br>
water vapor in the fuel exhaust stream into carbon dioxide and hydrogen. Thus, the<br>
reactor 128 increases the amount of hydrogen in the fuel exhaust stream. The catalyst<br>
may be any suitable catalyst, such as a iron oxide or a chromium promoted iron oxide<br>
catalyst. The reactor 128 may be located between the fuel heat exchanger 121 and the<br>
air preheater heat exchanger 125.<br>
[0065]	Optionally, the system 100 is operatively connected to a hydrogen<br>
storage vessel 129 or a hydrogen using device 131. However, the vessel 129 or<br>
device 131 may be omitted and the system 100 may be used to only produce<br>
electricity rather than electricity and hydrogen together. The hydrogen storage vessel<br>
may comprise a hydrogen storage tank or a hydrogen dispenser. The vessel may<br>
contain a conduit leading to a hydrogen using device which is used in transportation,<br>
power generation, cooling, hydrogenation reactions, or semiconductor manufacture. <br>
For example, the system 100 may be located in a chemical or a semiconductor plant to<br>
provide primary or secondary (i.e., backup) power for the plant as well as hydrogen<br>
for use in hydrogenation (i.e., passivation of semiconductor device) or other chemical<br>
reactions which require hydrogen that are carried out in the plant.<br>
[0066]	The hydrogen using device 131 may also comprise another fuel cell<br>
system (such as a fuel cell stack), such as low temperature fuel cell system, such as a<br>
proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell system, which uses hydrogen as a fuel.<br>
Thus, the hydrogen from the system 100 is provided as fuel to one or more additional<br>
fuel cells 131. For example, the system 100 may be located in a stationary location,<br>
such as a building or an area outside or below a building and is used to provide power<br>
to the building. The additional fuel cells 131 may be located in vehicles located in a<br>
18<br><br>
garage or a parking area adjacent to the stationary location. A vehicle may comprise<br>
a car, sport utility vehicle, truck, motorcycle, boat or any other suitable fuel cell<br>
powered vehicle. In this case, the hydrocarbon fuel is provided to the system 100 to<br>
generate electricity for the building and to generate hydrogen which is provided as<br>
fuel to the fuel cell system 131 powered vehicles. The generated hydrogen may be<br>
stored temporarily in the hydrogen storage vessel 129 and then provided from the<br>
storage vessel to the vehicle fuel cells 131 on demand (analogous to a gas station) or<br>
the generated hydrogen may be provided directly from the system 100 to the vehicle<br>
fuel cells 131 through a conduit.<br>
[0067]	The system 100 may contain an optional hydrogen conditioner. The<br>
hydrogen conditioner may be any suitable device which can purify, dry, compress<br>
(i.e., a compressor), or otherwise change the state point of the hydrogen-rich gas<br>
stream provided from the PPSA unit 1. If desired, the hydrogen conditioner may be<br>
omitted.<br>
[0068]	The optionally hydrogen using device 131 may comprise a PEM fuel<br>
cell system or another similar device which is generally carbon monoxide intolerant.<br>
Thus, carbon monoxide has to be scrubbed (i.e., removed by gas separation and/or<br>
chemical reaction) from the hydrogen rich stream being provided from the PPSA unit<br>
1 before the hydrogen rich stream is provided into the PEM fuel cells located in a<br>
vehicle or into another CO intolerant device 131.<br>
[0069]	In this case, the system 100 contains an optional carbon monoxide<br>
scrubbing device 133. The device 133 contains an inlet operatively connected to an<br>
outlet of the partial pressure swing adsorption unit 1 and an outlet operatively<br>
connected to a PEM fuel cell system 131 located in a vehicle. In operation, the<br>
carbon monoxide scrubbing device 133 scrubs carbon monoxide being provided with<br>
the hydrogen from the partial pressure swing adsorption unit 1 and provides the<br>
hydrogen either directly or indirectly to the PEM fuel cell system 131.<br>
[0070]	The carbon monoxide scrubbing device 133 may comprise any device<br>
which removes carbon monoxide from the hydrogen rich stream by adsorption,<br>
19<br><br>
chemical reaction and/or any other suitable method. The device 133 may comprise a<br>
pressure swing adsorption unit and/or a Sabatier reactor. For example, as shown in<br>
Figure 5, the scrubbing device comprises a Sabatier reactor 135 and a carbon<br>
monoxide polisher 137. The Sabatier reactor comprises a tube or another container<br>
which contains a catalyst, such as a platinum family metal on an alumina support.<br>
Preferably, the catalyst comprises ruthenium. A gas mixture consisting primarily of<br>
hydrogen and carbon monoxide is introduced into reactor tube from the PPSA system<br>
1 and contacts the catalyst therein. The gas mixture undergoes an immediate<br>
exothermic reaction and converts the carbon monoxide and some of the hydrogen to<br>
methane and water vapor. Remaining carbon monoxide is then additionally scrubbed<br>
from the hydrogen, methane and water vapor gas stream in the polisher 137, which<br>
may comprise a silver based adsorption device which adsorbs carbon monoxide. The<br>
polisher may comprise plural adsorption beds where one bed adsorbs carbon<br>
monoxide while other beds are being regenerated. The outlet stream containing<br>
hydrogen, methane and water vapor from the polisher is then provided to the<br>
hydrogen storage vessel 129 or the hydrogen using device 131 (the separate purge gas<br>
outlet from the polisher 137 is not shown for clarity). The hydrogen may be used as<br>
the fuel in the PEM fuel cell system 131, the water vapor may be used to humidify the<br>
PEM electrolyte and the methane simply acts as a diluting gas in a PEM system.<br>
[0071]	Alternatively, the carbon monoxide scrubbing device 133 may<br>
comprise a pressure swing adsorption ("PSA") unit. This unit is similar to the PPSA<br>
unit 1, except that a reciprocating compressor is used to pressurize the feed gas into<br>
one or more adsorbent beds which contain a material which selectively adsorbs<br>
carbon monoxide compared to hydrogen. The pressure swing adsorption unit may<br>
operate on a Skarstrom-like PSA cycle. The classic Skarstrom cycle consists of four<br>
basic steps: pressurization, feed, blowdown, and purge. For example, the PSA unit<br>
may contain two adsorbent beds. When one bed is undergoing pressurization and<br>
feed by the compressor, the other column is undergoing blowdown and purge. Three-<br>
way valves may be used to direct the feed, purge and product gases between the beds.<br>
20<br><br>
[0072]	Alternatively, the optional device 131 may comprise a carbon<br>
monoxide tolerant electrochemical cell, such as a stack of high-temperature, low-<br>
hydration ion exchange membrane cells. This type of cell includes a non-fluorinated<br>
ion exchange ionomer membrane, such as, for example, a polybenzimidazole (PBI)<br>
membrane, located between anode and cathode electrodes. The membrane is doped<br>
with an acid, such as sulfuric or phosphoric acid. An example of such cell is<br>
disclosed in US published application US 2003/0196893 Al, incorporated herein by<br>
reference in its entirety. A stack 131 of these cells may be operated in a fuel cell<br>
mode to generate electricity for a vehicle or other uses when hydrogen is provided to<br>
the cells of the stack. These cells are carbon monoxide tolerant and operate in a<br>
temperature range of above 100 to about 200 degrees Celsius. Thus, the hydrogen<br>
containing stream is preferably provided to the stack 131 at a temperature above about<br>
120 degrees Celsius. If a carbon monoxide tolerant device 131 is used, then the<br>
carbon monoxide scrubbing device 133 is preferably omitted.<br>
[0073]	The system 100 also contains a fuel splitter device 201, such as a<br>
computer or operator controlled multi-way valve, for example a three-way valve, or<br>
another fluid splitting device. The device 201 contains an inlet 203 operatively<br>
connected to the fuel cell stack fuel exhaust outlet 103, a first outlet 205 operatively<br>
connected to the condenser 113 and water separator 115 and a second outlet 207<br>
operatively connected to the fuel cell stack fuel inlet 105. For example, the second<br>
outlet 207 may be operatively connected to the fuel inlet conduit 111, which is<br>
operatively connected to inlet 105. However, the second outlet 207 may provide a<br>
portion of the fuel exhaust stream into the fuel inlet stream further downstream.<br>
[0074]	Preferably, the system 200 contains a second blower or compressor<br>
209 which provides the fuel exhaust stream into the fuel inlet stream. Specifically,<br>
the outlet 207 of the valve 201 is operatively connected to an inlet of the blower or<br>
compressor 209, while an outlet of the blower or compressor 209 is connected to the<br>
hydrocarbon fuel inlet conduit 111 which is the source of the hydrocarbon fuel inlet<br>
stream. In operation, the blower or compressor 209 controllably provides a desired<br>
amount of the fuel cell stack fuel exhaust stream into the fuel cell stack fuel inlet<br>
21<br><br>
stream. In one aspect of this embodiment, the device 209 is a low temperature blower<br>
which, operates at a temperature of 200 degrees Celsius or less. In this case, the heat<br>
exchangers 121 and 125 lower the temperature of the fuel exhaust stream to 200<br>
degrees Celsius or less to allow the use of the low temperature blower 209.<br>
[0075]	The system 100 of the fifth embodiment operates as follows. A fuel<br>
inlet stream is provided into the fuel cell stack 101 through fuel inlet conduit 111.<br>
The fuel may comprise any suitable fuel, such as a hydrocarbon fuel, including but<br>
not limited to methane, natural gas which contains methane with hydrogen and other<br>
gases, propane or other biogas, or a mixture of a carbon fuel, such as carbon<br>
monoxide, oxygenated carbon containing gas, such as methanol, or other carbon<br>
containing gas with a hydrogen containing gas, such as water vapor, H2 gas or their<br>
mixtures. For example, the mixture may comprise syngas derived from coal or<br>
natural gas reformation.<br>
[0076]	The fuel inlet stream is combined with a portion of the fuel exhaust<br>
stream such that hydrogen and humidity (i.e., water vapor) from the fuel exhaust<br>
stream is added to the fuel inlet stream. The humidified fuel inlet stream then passes<br>
through the fuel heat exchanger 121 where the humidified fuel inlet stream is heated<br>
by the fuel cell stack fuel exhaust stream. The heated and humidified fuel inlet stream<br>
is then provided into a reformer 123, which is preferably an external reformer. For<br>
example, reformer 123 may comprise a reformer described in U.S. Patent Application<br>
Serial Number 11/002,681, filed on December 2, 2004, incorporated herein by<br>
reference in its entirety. The fuel reformer 123 may be any suitable device which is<br>
capable of partially or wholly reforming a hydrocarbon fuel to form a carbon<br>
containing and free hydrogen containing fuel. For example, the fuel reformer 123<br>
may be any suitable device which can reform a hydrocarbon gas into a gas mixture of<br>
free hydrogen and a carbon containing gas. For example, the fuel reformer 123 may<br>
comprise a catalyst coated passage where a humidified biogas, such as natural gas, is<br>
reformed via a steam-methane reformation reaction to form free hydrogen, carbon<br>
monoxide, carbon dioxide, water vapor and optionally a residual amount of<br>
unreformed biogas. The free hydrogen and carbon monoxide are then provided into<br>
22<br><br>
the fuel (i.e., anode) inlet 105 of the fuel cell stack 101. Thus, with respect to the fuel<br>
inlet stream, which is located upstream of the reformer 123 which is located upstream<br>
of the stack 101.<br>
[0077]	The air or other oxygen containing gas (i.e., oxidizer) inlet stream is<br>
preferably provided into the stack 101 through a heat exchanger 127, where it is<br>
heated by the air (i.e., cathode) exhaust stream from the fuel cell stack. If desired, the<br>
air inlet stream may also pass through the condenser 113 and/or the air preheat heat<br>
exchanger 125 to further increase the temperature of the air before providing the air<br>
into the stack 101.<br>
[0078]	Once the fuel and air are provided into the fuel cell stack 101, the stack<br>
101 is operated to generate electricity and a hydrogen containing fuel exhaust stream.<br>
The fuel exhaust stream (i.e., the stack anode exhaust stream) is provided from the<br>
stack fuel exhaust outlet 103 into the partial pressure swing adsorption unit 1. At least<br>
a portion of hydrogen contained in the fuel exhaust stream is separated in the unit 1<br>
using a partial pressure swing adsorption. The hydrogen separated from the fuel<br>
exhaust stream in the unit 1 is then provided into the fuel inlet stream and/or to the<br>
hydrogen storage vessel 129 or the hydrogen using device 131.<br>
[0079]	The fuel exhaust stream is provided into the unit 1 as follows. The fuel<br>
exhaust stream may contain hydrogen, water vapor, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide,<br>
some unreacted hydrocarbon gas, such as methane and other reaction by-products and<br>
impurities. For example, the fuel exhaust may have a flow rate of between 160 and<br>
225 slpm, such as about 186 to about 196 slpm, and may comprise between about 45<br>
to about 55%, such as about 48-50% hydrogen, about 40 to about 50%, such as about<br>
45-47% carbon dioxide, about 2% to about 4%, such as about 3% water and about 1%<br>
to about 2% carbon monoxide.<br>
[0080]	This exhaust stream is first provided into the heat exchanger 121,<br>
where its temperature is lowered, preferably to less than 200 degrees Celsius, while<br>
the temperature of the fuel inlet stream is raised. If the air preheater heat exchanger<br>
125 is present, then the fuel exhaust stream is provided through this heat exchanger<br>
23<br><br>
125 to further lower its temperature while raising the temperature of the air inlet<br>
stream. The temperature may be lowered to 90 to 110 degrees Celsius for example.<br>
[0081]	The fuel exhaust stream is then separated into at least two streams by<br>
the device 201. The first fuel exhaust stream is provided toward device 209 which<br>
recycles this first stream into the fuel inlet stream, while the second fuel exhaust<br>
stream is directed toward the PPSA unit 1 where at least a portion of hydrogen<br>
contained in the second fuel exhaust stream is separated using the partial pressure<br>
swing adsorption. At least a portion of the hydrogen separated from the second fuel<br>
exhaust stream is then provided to the hydrogen storage vessel 129 or the hydrogen<br>
using device 131, and/or a portion of the hydrogen and carbon monoxide separated<br>
from the second fuel exhaust stream are provided into the fuel inlet stream in the fuel<br>
inlet conduit 111. For example, between 50 and 70%, such as about 60% of the fuel<br>
exhaust stream may be provided to the second blower or compressor 209, while the<br>
remainder may be provided toward the PPSA unit 1.<br>
[0082]	Preferably, the fuel exhaust stream is first provided through the heat<br>
exchanger 121, reactor 128 and heat exchanger 125 before being provided into the<br>
valve 201. The fuel exhaust stream is cooled to 200 degrees Celsius or less, such as<br>
to 90 to 180 degrees, in the heat exchanger 125 prior to being provided into the valve<br>
201 where it is separated into two streams. This allows the use of a low temperature<br>
blower 209 to controllably recycle a desired amount of the first fuel exhaust stream<br>
into the fuel inlet stream, since such blower may be adapted to move a gas stream<br>
which has a temperature of 200 degrees Celsius or less.<br>
[0083]	The first fuel exhaust stream is provided into the second blower or<br>
compressor 209 which recycles this stream into the fuel inlet stream. The device 209<br>
may be computer or operator controlled and may vary the amount of the fuel exhaust<br>
stream being provided into the fuel inlet stream depending on any suitable parameters,<br>
which include: i) detected or observed conditions of the system 100 (i.e., changes in<br>
the system operating conditions requiring a change in the amount of hydrogen or CO<br>
in the fuel inlet stream); ii) previous calculations provided into the computer or<br>
conditions known to the operator which require a temporal adjustment of the<br>
24<br><br>
hydrogen or CO in the fuel inlet stream; iii) desired future changes, presently<br>
occurring changes or recent past changes in the operating parameters of the stack 101,<br>
such as changes in the electricity demand by the users of electricity generated by the<br>
stack, changes in price for electricity or hydrocarbon fuel compared to the price of<br>
hydrogen, etc., and/or iv) changes in the demand for hydrogen by the hydrogen user,<br>
such as the hydrogen using device, changes in price of hydrogen or hydrocarbon fuel<br>
compared to the price of electricity.<br>
[0084]	Furthermore, the second blower or compressor may be operated in<br>
tandem with the first blower or compressor 109. Thus, the operator or computer may<br>
separately vary the amount of hydrogen being provided into vessel 129 or device 131,<br>
the amount of hydrogen and carbon monoxide being provided into the fuel inlet<br>
stream by the first blower or compressor 109, and the amount of fuel exhaust stream<br>
being provided into the fuel inlet stream by the second blower or compressor 209<br>
based on any suitable criteria, such as the ones described above. Furthermore, the<br>
computer or operator may take into account both the amount of hydrogen and carbon<br>
monoxide being provided into the fuel inlet stream by the first blower or compressor<br>
109 and the amount of fuel exhaust stream being provided into the fuel inlet stream by<br>
the second blower or compressor 209 and optimize the amount of both based on the<br>
criteria described above.<br>
[0085]	The second fuel exhaust stream is provided from the valve 201 into the<br>
condenser 113 where it is further cooled to condense additional water vapor from the<br>
fuel exhaust stream. The fuel exhaust stream may be cooled in the condenser by the<br>
fuel cell stack air inlet stream or by a different air inlet stream or by another cooling<br>
fluid stream. The water condensed from the fuel exhaust stream is collected in the<br>
liquid state in the water separator 115. Water may be discharged from the separator<br>
115 via conduit 117 and then drained away or reused.<br>
[0086]	The remaining fuel exhaust stream gas is then provided from the<br>
separator 115 as the feed gas inlet stream into inlet 2 of the partial pressure swing<br>
adsorption unit 1 via conduit 3. Furthermore, the purge gas inlet stream, such as a<br>
dried air stream is provided into the unit 1 from blower or compressor 6 through<br>
25<br><br>
conduit 5 into inlet 4. If desired, the air stream may be dried using additional<br>
adsorbent beds in a temperature swing adsorption cycle before being provided into<br>
adsorbent beds 11,13 of the unit 1. In this case, the heated air used in the temperature<br>
swing adsorption cycle to dry the silica gel or alumina in the adsorbent beds may be<br>
removed from unit 1 via a vent conduit 139.<br>
[0087]	Thus, the second fuel exhaust stream comprises hydrogen, carbon<br>
monoxide, water vapor, carbon dioxide as well as possible impurities and unreacted<br>
hydrocarbon fuel. During the separation step in unit 1, at least a majority of the water<br>
vapor and carbon dioxide in the fuel exhaust stream are adsorbed in at least one<br>
adsorbent bed 11, 13 while allowing at least a majority of the hydrogen and carbon<br>
monoxide in the fuel exhaust stream to be passed through the at least one adsorbent<br>
bed. Specifically, unpressurized fuel exhaust stream is provided into the first<br>
adsorbent bed 11 to adsorb at least a majority of the water vapor and carbon dioxide<br>
remaining in the fuel exhaust stream in the first adsorbent bed until the first adsorbent<br>
bed is saturated, while the second adsorbent bed 13 is regenerated by providing air<br>
having a relative humidity of 50% or less at about 30 degrees Celsius through the<br>
second adsorbent bed to desorb adsorbed carbon dioxide and water vapor. After the<br>
first bed 11 is saturated with carbon dioxide, the unpressurized fuel exhaust stream is<br>
provided into the second adsorbent bed 13 to adsorb at least a majority of the<br>
remaining water vapor and carbon dioxide in the fuel exhaust stream in the second<br>
adsorbent bed until the second adsorbent bed is saturated while regenerating the first<br>
adsorbent bed by providing air having a relative humidity of 50% or less at about 30<br>
degrees Celsius through the first adsorbent bed 11 to desorb the adsorbed carbon<br>
dioxide and water vapor.<br>
[0088]	The hydrogen and carbon monoxide separated from the fuel exhaust<br>
stream (i.e., feed gas outlet stream) are then removed from unit 1 through outlet 8 and<br>
conduit 7 and provided into the optional selector valve 108. The valve 108 divides<br>
the hydrogen containing stream provided from the PPSA unit 1 into a first stream,<br>
which is provided into the hydrocarbon fuel inlet stream in the inlet conduit 111, and<br>
26<br><br>
a second stream which is provided to the hydrogen storage vessel 129 or the hydrogen<br>
using device 131.<br>
[0089]	The valve 108 may divide the hydrogen containing stream into<br>
contemporaneous first and second streams, such that the first and the second streams<br>
are provided from the valve 108 at the same time. The valve 108 may vary the ratio<br>
of how much of the hydrogen containing stream provided from the PPSA unit 1 is<br>
provided into a first stream and how much of the hydrogen containing stream is<br>
provided into the second stream over time. Alternatively, the valve 108 may alternate<br>
between providing at least 90-100% of the hydrogen containing stream into the<br>
hydrocarbon fuel inlet stream and providing 90 to 100% of the hydrogen containing<br>
stream to the hydrogen storage vessel 129, for example. If desired one of the steams<br>
may be omitted and the valve 108 may simply constantly direct the hydrogen<br>
containing stream into either the vessel 129 / device 131 or into the fuel inlet conduit<br>
111.<br>
[0090]	The valve 108 may be operated by a computer and/or by an operator to<br>
controllably provide a desired amount of hydrogen into the fuel inlet stream and/or to<br>
one of the hydrogen storage vessel and the hydrogen using device. The computer or<br>
operator may vary this amount based on any suitable parameter. The parameters<br>
include: i) detected or observed conditions of the system 100 (i.e., changes in the<br>
system operating conditions requiring a change in the amount of hydrogen or CO in<br>
the fuel inlet stream); ii) previous calculations provided into the computer or<br>
conditions known to the operator which require a temporal adjustment of the<br>
hydrogen or CO in the fuel inlet stream; iii) desired future changes, presently<br>
occurring changes or recent past changes in the operating parameters of the stack 101,<br>
such as changes in the electricity demand by the users of electricity generated by the<br>
stack, changes in price for electricity or hydrocarbon fuel compared to the price of<br>
hydrogen, etc., and/or iv) changes in the demand for hydrogen by the hydrogen user,<br>
such as the hydrogen using device, changes in price of hydrogen or hydrocarbon fuel<br>
compared to the price of electricity, etc.<br>
27<br><br>
[0091]	The second hydrogen rich stream may be provided directly to vessel<br>
129 or device 131 or it may first be provided through the carbon monoxide scrubbing<br>
device 133 to scrub carbon monoxide from the second stream before providing the<br>
stream to a carbon monoxide intolerant device. For example, the second hydrogen<br>
stream may be first provided to the hydrogen storage vessel 129 and then provided<br>
from the hydrogen storage vessel 129 to the hydrogen using device, such as a PEM<br>
fuel cell system 131 in a vehicle, on demand or according to a predefined schedule.<br>
Alternatively, the second hydrogen stream may be provided to the hydrogen using<br>
device, such as a PEM fuel cell system 131 without first being provided to the<br>
hydrogen storage vessel 129.<br>
[0092]	The first hydrogen rich stream provided from the selector valve is<br>
recycled into the fuel inlet stream in the fuel inlet conduit 111. Preferably, this first<br>
hydrogen rich stream containing hydrogen and carbon monoxide is first provided into<br>
a blower or compressor 109, which is then used to controllably provide a desired<br>
amount of hydrogen and carbon monoxide separated from the fuel exhaust stream into<br>
the fuel inlet stream. The blower or compressor 109 may be operated by a computer<br>
or by an operator to controllably provide a desired amount of hydrogen and carbon<br>
monoxide into the fuel inlet stream, and may vary this amount based on any suitable<br>
parameter. The parameters include: i) detected or observed conditions of the system<br>
100 (i.e., changes in the system operating conditions requiring a change in the amount<br>
of hydrogen or CO in the fuel inlet stream); ii) previous calculations provided into the<br>
computer or conditions known to the operator which require a temporal adjustment of<br>
the hydrogen or CO in the fuel inlet stream; and/or Hi) desired future changes,<br>
presently occurring changes or recent past changes in the operating parameters of the<br>
stack 101, such as changes in the electricity demand by the users of electricity<br>
generated by the stack, etc. Thus, the blower or compressor may controllably vary the<br>
amount of hydrogen and carbon monoxide provided into the fuel inlet stream based<br>
on the above described and/or other criteria. Since the hydrogen and carbon<br>
monoxide are cooled to 200 degrees Celsius or less, a low temperature blower may be<br>
used to controllably provide the hydrogen and carbon monoxide into the conduit 111.<br>
If desired, the selector valve 108 and the blower or compressor 109 may be omitted<br>
28<br><br>
and the entire hydrogen rich stream may be provided from the PPSA unit 1 to the<br>
hydrogen storage vessel 129 or the hydrogen using device 131.<br>
[0093]	The purge gas outlet stream from the PPSA unit may contain a trace<br>
amount of hydrogen and/or hydrocarbon gases trapped in the void volumes of the<br>
adsorbent beds. In other words, some trapped hydrogen or hydrocarbon gas may not<br>
be removed into conduit 7 by the flush steps. Thus, it is preferred that conduit 9<br>
provide the purge gas outlet stream from PPSA unit 1 to a burner 107. The stack 101<br>
air exhaust stream is also provided through heat exchanger 127 into the burner 107.<br>
Any remaining hydrogen or hydrocarbon gas in the purge gas outlet stream is then<br>
burned in the burner to avoid polluting the environment The heat from the burner<br>
107 may be used to heat the reformer 123 or it may be provided to other parts of the<br>
system 100 or to a heat consuming devices outside the system 100, such as a building<br>
heating system.<br>
[0094]	Thus, with respect to the fuel exhaust stream, the heat exchanger 121 is<br>
located upstream of the heat exchanger 125, which is located upstream of the<br>
condenser 113 and water separator 115, which is located upstream of the PPSA unit 1,<br>
which is located upstream of blower or compressor 109 which is located upstream of<br>
the fuel inlet conduit 111.<br>
[0095]	If desired, the system 100 may be used together with a humidifier.<br>
Such a system could then be operated in different modes to optimize electricity<br>
generation or to optimize hydrogen production for the hydrogen storage vessel 129 or<br>
the hydrogen using device 131. The system may be switched between different<br>
modes depending on the demand for and/or price of electricity and hydrogen or other<br>
factors.<br>
[0096]	The humidifier may having a first inlet operatively connected to a<br>
hydrocarbon fuel source, such as the hydrocarbon fuel inlet conduit 111, a second<br>
inlet operatively connected to the valve 201, a first outlet operatively connected to the<br>
fuel cell stack fuel inlet 105, and a second outlet operatively connected to the<br>
condenser 113 and water separator 115. In operation, the fuel humidifier humidifies<br>
29<br><br>
a hydrocarbon fuel inlet stream from conduit 111 containing the recycled hydrogen<br>
and carbon monoxide using water vapor contained in a fuel cell stack fuel exhaust<br>
stream. The fuel humidifier may comprise a polymeric membrane humidifier, such as<br>
a Nation® membrane humidifier, an enthalpy wheel or a plurality of water adsorbent<br>
beds, as described for example in U.S. Patent Number 6,106,964 and in U.S.<br>
Application Serial Number 10/368,425, both incorporated herein by reference in their<br>
entirety. For example, one suitable type of humidifier comprises a water vapor and<br>
enthalpy transfer Nafion® based, water permeable membrane available from Perma<br>
Pure LLC. The humidifier passively transfers water vapor and enthalpy from the fuel<br>
exhaust stream into the fuel inlet stream to provide a 2 to 2.5 steam to carbon ratio in<br>
the fuel inlet stream. The fuel inlet stream temperature may be raised to about 80 to<br>
about 90 degrees Celsius in the humidifier.<br>
[0097]	When the system is operated to optimize electricity generation (i.e., to<br>
optimize the AC electrical efficiency of the system), the selector valve 108 provides<br>
the entire hydrogen rich stream from the PPSA unit 1 back into the fuel inlet conduit.<br>
The valve 201 provides a portion of the fuel exhaust stream into the fuel inlet conduit<br>
111 to humidify the fuel inlet stream. In this case, the valve 201 may route the fuel<br>
exhaust stream into the fuel inlet conduit to by-pass the humidifier. The per pass fuel<br>
utilization rate is maximized to the highest reasonable operating value, such as about<br>
75% to about 80%, for example, to optimize the electricity production. In this case,<br>
no hydrogen is provided to the hydrogen storage vessel 129 or to the hydrogen using<br>
device 131.<br>
[0098]	When the system is operated to optimize hydrogen generation for the<br>
hydrogen storage vessel 129 or to the hydrogen using device 131, the selector valve<br>
108 provides the entire hydrogen rich stream from the PPSA unit 1 to the hydrogen<br>
storage vessel 129 or to the hydrogen using device 131. No hydrogen rich stream is<br>
provided into the fuel inlet conduit. In this case, the valve 201 provides the entire fuel<br>
exhaust stream from the stack into the humidifier where the fuel inlet stream is<br>
humidified, rather than providing a portion of the fuel exhaust stream into the fuel<br>
inlet conduit 111. The per pass fuel utilization rate is minimized to the lowest<br>
30<br><br>
reasonable operating value, such as about 55% to about 60%, for example, to optimize<br>
the hydrogen production. In this case, a maximum amount of hydrogen is provided to<br>
the hydrogen storage vessel 129 or to the hydrogen using device 131. Furthermore,<br>
more hydrocarbon fuel may be provided to the fuel cell stack when the system<br>
operates to optimize hydrogen production than when the system operates to optimize<br>
electrical efficiency. For example, 50-100% more hydrocarbon fuel is provided to the<br>
stack 101 when the system is operating to optimize hydrogen production than when<br>
the system is operating to optimize electrical efficiency.<br>
[0099]	The system may also be operated to balance electrical efficiency and<br>
hydrogen production. In this case, the selector valve 108 splits the hydrogen rich<br>
stream from the PPSA unit 1 between the fuel inlet conduit 111 and the hydrogen<br>
storage vessel 129 / hydrogen using device 131. Both steams may be provided at the<br>
same time or the valve may alternate between providing the first and the second<br>
streams. The amount of hydrogen provided between the two streams can be varied<br>
depending on the conditions described above. In this case, the valve 201 may provide<br>
the fuel exhaust stream into the fuel inlet stream and/or into the humidifier 119,<br>
depending on the desired parameters.<br>
[0100]	Table I below illustrates several exemplary operating modes for the<br>
system to generate the same power output of 26.8 kW. The first mode is the electrical<br>
efficiency optimization mode described above, where the selector valve 108 provides<br>
the entire hydrogen rich stream into the fuel inlet conduit 111 ("hydrogen recycle<br>
ON") and valve 201 provides a portion of the fuel exhaust stream into the fuel inlet<br>
conduit 111 ("fuel exhaust recycle ON"). The electrical efficiency is optimized to<br>
about 58% for a relatively low natural gas fuel flow rate. The second mode is similar<br>
to the first mode, except that valve 201 provides the fuel exhaust stream to the<br>
humidifier 119 which humidifies the fuel inlet stream (the hydrogen recycle is ON<br>
while the fuel exhaust recycle is OFF).<br>
[0101]	The third mode is the opposite of the second mode, where the selector<br>
valve 108 provides the hydrogen rich stream into the vessel 129 / device 131<br>
31<br><br>
("hydrogen recycle OFF") and the valve 201 provides a portion of the fuel exhaust<br>
stream into the fuel inlet conduit 111 ("fuel exhaust recycle ON").<br>
[0102]	The fourth and fifth modes are the hydrogen generation optimization<br>
modes, where the selector valve 108 provides the hydrogen rich stream to vessel 129<br>
or device 131 ("hydrogen recycle OFF") and the humidifier 119 is used to humidify<br>
the fuel inlet stream ("fuel exhaust recycle OFF"). In the fifth mode, the per pass fuel<br>
utilization rate is decreased 20% and the natural gas flow rate is increased compared<br>
to the fourth mode to more than triple the hydrogen generation. Thus, in the fifth<br>
mode, the hydrogen generation is optimized at the expense of the low electrical<br>
efficiency (below 40%), low per pass fuel utilization rate (55%) and a relatively high<br>
natural gas fuel flow rate.<br>

[0103]	Figure 6 illustrates a system 300 according to the sixth embodiment of<br>
the invention. The system 300 is similar to system 100, except that the PPSA unit 1,<br>
the condenser 113 and water separator 115 are replaced with an electrochemical<br>
hydrogen pump 301. The pump 301 electrochemically separates hydrogen from the<br>
fuel exhaust stream.<br>
[0104]	The electrochemical pump 301 may comprise any suitable proton<br>
exchange membrane device comprising a polymer electrolyte. The hydrogen diffuses<br>
through the polymer electrolyte under an application of a potential difference between<br>
anode and cathode electrodes located on either side of the electrolyte. Preferably, the<br>
electrochemical pump comprises a stack of carbon monoxide tolerant electrochemical<br>
cells, such as a stack of high-temperature, low-hydration ion exchange membrane<br>
cells. This type of cell includes a non-fluorinated ion exchange ionomer membrane,<br>
such as, for example, a polybenzimidazole (PBI) membrane, located between anode<br>
and cathode electrodes. The membrane is doped with an acid, such as sulfuric or<br>
phosphoric acid. An example of such cell is disclosed in US published application<br>
US 2003/0196893 Al, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. These cells<br>
operate in a temperature range of above 100 to about 200 degrees Celsius. Thus, the<br>
heat exchangers 121 and 125 preferably keep the fuel exhaust stream at a temperature<br>
of about 120 to about 200 degrees Celsius such as about 160 to about 190 degrees<br>
Celsius. Figure 6 does not illustrate for clarity the valve 108 and hydrogen storage<br>
vessel 129 or the hydrogen using device 131. However, these devices may be used in<br>
the system 300 if desired. Since the pump 301 provides a hydrogen stream that lacks<br>
a substantial amount of carbon monoxide, the CO scrubber 135 is not required to be<br>
used with the pump 301 and the hydrogen is provided into the fuel inlet stream<br>
without the carbon monoxide.<br>
[0105]	The method of operating the system 300 is similar to the method of<br>
operating the system 100, except that the fuel exhaust stream is provided directly fcom<br>
valve 201 into the electrochemical pump 301, which electrochemically separates the<br>
hydrogen from the fuel exhaust stream. Furthermore, the blower or compressor 109<br>
may be omitted if the pump 301 is capable of controllably providing a desired amount<br>
33<br><br>
of hydrogen into the fuel inlet stream. In the method of the sixth embodiment, the<br>
effective fuel utilization rate is about 94% and the electrical efficiency is about 58%<br>
when the per pass fuel utilization rate is 75%, 60% of the fuel exhaust stream is<br>
recycled into the fuel inlet stream by valve 201 and about 85% of the hydrogen is<br>
recovered from the remaining fuel exhaust stream by pump 301 and recycled into the<br>
fuel inlet stream.<br>
[0106]	In a seventh embodiment of the invention, a temperature swing<br>
adsorption ("TSA") unit is used to separate hydrogen from the fuel exhaust stream<br>
instead of the PPSA unit 1. A TSA unit also does not require the feed gas to be<br>
pressurized.<br>
[0107]	The TSA unit also contains a plurality of adsorbent beds of material<br>
which preferentially adsorbs carbon dioxide and water vapor to hydrogen and carbon<br>
monoxide. The fuel exhaust stream is provided to at least one first adsorbent bed<br>
which is maintained at room temperature or other low temperature to adsorb at large<br>
portion of carbon dioxide and water vapor from the fuel exhaust stream. When the<br>
first beds is saturated with carbon dioxide and water vapor, the fuel exhaust stream is<br>
switched to at least one second adsorbent bed. The first bed is then purged to release<br>
the adsorbed carbon dioxide and water vapor by increasing the temperature of the first<br>
bed. For example, the first bed may be heated by heat provided by the fuel cell stack,<br>
such as by providing the hot stack cathode air exhaust in heat exchange with the first<br>
bed. After purging, the first bed is then cooled with ambient air heat exchange. The<br>
cycle continues through the multiple beds to provide a constant recovery and<br>
circulation of the fuel. This embodiment is also amenable to the sequestration of<br>
carbon dioxide.<br>
[0108]	Rather than providing air in heat exchange with (i.e., adjacent to) the<br>
beds, the hot cathode exhaust may be directed through the adsorbent beds directly<br>
(with no separate heat exchanger) to discharge the carbon dioxide and water vapor.<br>
Then cool ambient air is passed directly through the beds to condition the beds for the<br>
next cycle. If desired, a small quantity of nitrogen may be is purged through the beds<br>
before and after the bed is reconditioned for additional carbon dioxide and water<br>
34<br><br>
adsorption. The nitrogen is obtained from a small temperature swing adsorption<br>
device using air as the working fluid.<br>
[0109]	If desired, the TSA effluent, such as the carbon dioxide and water<br>
vapor containing effluent, may be discharged to ambient or removed via a vacuum<br>
pump after the purge gas is stopped. The vacuum removes more of the residual carbon<br>
dioxide and water (a process akin to pressure-swing adsorption, and commonly<br>
referred to as vacuum-swing adsorption) which might offer a less expensive and faster<br>
means to cool the bed than might be achieved using cool air or heat exchange. The<br>
use of the vacuum may also be amenable to the sequestration of carbon dioxide.<br>
[0110]	Figure 7 illustrates a system 400 according to the eighth embodiment<br>
of the invention. The system 400 is similar to system 100, except that the PPSA unit<br>
1, blower or compressor 109 and water separator 115 are omitted. The condenser 113<br>
may also be optionally omitted. The method of operating the system 400 is similar to<br>
the method of operating the system 100, except that the second separated fuel exhaust<br>
stream provided from valve 201 is not subjected to hydrogen separation. Instead, the<br>
second separated fuel exhaust stream provided from the valve 201 is either vented or<br>
provided to the burner 107. This system 400 is thus simpler than the systems of the<br>
prior embodiments, since it does not include hydrogen separation steps and<br>
equipment. The method of operating the system 400 allows the use of a low<br>
temperature blower 209 by cooling the fuel exhaust stream to less than 200 degrees<br>
Celsius, such as about 90 to 110 degrees Celsius, by passing this stream through heat<br>
exchangers 121 and 125 in series. In the method of the eighth embodiment, the<br>
electrical efficiency is about 54% when the per pass fuel utilization rate is 75% and<br>
60% of the fuel exhaust stream is recycled into the fuel inlet stream by valve 201.<br>
[0111]	The method of the eighth embodiment is similar to the method of the<br>
fifth embodiment up to the point where the fuel exhaust stream is provided into the<br>
device 201. As noted above, the fuel splitter device 201 is preferably a computer or<br>
operator controlled multi-way valve, such as a three-way valve. The valve 201<br>
separates the fuel exhaust stream into a first separated fuel exhaust stream and a<br>
second separated fuel exhaust stream. The first separated fuel exhaust stream is<br>
35<br><br>
provided into the blower 209 fromvalve 201 outlet 207. The blower 209 recycles the<br>
first separated fuel exhaust stream into the fuel inlet stream at the mixer in the fuel<br>
inlet conduit 111. Preferably, as noted above, the blower 209 is a low temperature<br>
blower which recycles the first separated fuel exhaust stream having a temperature of<br>
200 C or less into the fuel inlet stream.<br>
[0112]	In one aspect of the present embodiment, the amount of fuel exhaust<br>
provided into the fuel inlet stream is controlled by an operator or automatically by a<br>
computer to achieve a steam to carbon ratio of between 2:1 and 2.3:1 in the fuel inlet<br>
stream. The first separated fuel exhaust stream contains steam and the fuel inlet<br>
stream comprises a hydrocarbon fuel inlet stream, such as a methane or natural gas<br>
stream. Thus, the amount of fuel exhaust (and thus the amount of steam) provided<br>
into the fuel inlet stream is controlled to achieve a steam to carbon ratio of between<br>
2:1 and 2.3:1, such as a 2.2:1 ratio, in the fuel inlet stream. For methane fuel, each<br>
methane molecule provided into the reformer contains one carbon atom. Thus, the<br>
H2O:C molar ratio is based on the ratio of H2O molecules to methane molecules.<br>
However, for other hydrocarbon fuels which contain hydrocarbon molecules with<br>
more than one carbon atom per molecule, the ratio of H2O molecules to such<br>
hydrocarbon molecules would be greater than 2.3:1 to maintain the desired steam to<br>
carbon ratio. The amount of fuel exhaust being recycled into the fuel inlet stream can<br>
be varied continuously or intermittently to continuously maintain the steam to carbon<br>
ratio between 2:1 and 2.3:1 in the fuel inlet stream during operation of the fuel cell<br>
stack. This steam to carbon ratio is advantageous for optimum steam-methane<br>
reformation in the reformer 123.<br>
[0113]	As used herein, the term "controllably" means that the amount of fuel<br>
exhaust provided into a fuel inlet stream is actively controlled as opposed to passively<br>
provided into the fuel inlet stream without control. Thus, simply routing a part of the<br>
exhaust stream into the fuel inlet stream through a "T"-shaped branched pipe is not<br>
controllably providing the exhaust stream into the inlet stream. The amount of fuel<br>
exhaust being recycled can be controlled by the operator or by a computer by<br>
controlling one or both of the valve 201 and/or the blower 209. For example, the<br>
36<br><br>
valve 201 may be controlled to vary the ratio of the first separated fuel exhaust stream<br>
to the second separated fuel exhaust stream. In other words, if more steam is needed<br>
in the fuel inlet stream, then the valve increases the portion of the fuel exhaust stream<br>
which is provided into the first separated fuel exhaust stream. If less steam is needed<br>
in the fuel inlet stream, then the valve decreases the portion of the fuel exhaust stream<br>
which is provided into the first separated fuel exhaust stream. The blower 209 may<br>
be controlled by increasing or decreasing the blowing speed or rate to increase or<br>
decrease the amount of fuel exhaust being provided by the blower 209 into the fuel<br>
inlet stream depending on whether more or less steam is required in the fuel inlet<br>
stream.<br>
[0114]	Preferably, at least one operating parameter of the fuel cell system is<br>
detected (i.e., monitored) to determine the amount of fuel exhaust that needs to be<br>
recycled into the fuel inlet stream. For example, the temperature of the stack or<br>
balance of plant components may be monitored with a temperature sensor, the fuel<br>
inlet and exhaust flows may be monitored with a gas flow meter, the amount of<br>
power, current or voltage generated by the stack may be monitored by an appropriate<br>
electronic detector (i.e., watt meter, volt meter, amp meter, etc.), etc. Based on the<br>
detected operating parameter(s), the computer or operator then varies at least one of a<br>
ratio of the first separated fuel exhaust stream to the second separated fuel exhaust<br>
stream or an amount in the first separated fuel exhaust stream being recycled into the<br>
fuel inlet stream by the blower. For example, a computer may be used to<br>
automatically control the multi-way valve 201 and/or the blower 209 based on the<br>
detected parameters being provided into the computer from one of the system<br>
detectors (i.e., sensors). Alternatively, the operator may control the valve 201 and/or<br>
blower 209 by using the system control panel based on displayed parameter(s).<br>
[0115]	The second separated fuel exhaust stream is provided from the output<br>
205 of the valve 201 into the burner 107. The second stream may be provided<br>
directly or indirectly from the valve 201 into the burner 107. For example, the output<br>
205 of the valve 201 may be directly connected to the burner 107 by a conduit. If<br>
desired, additional air and/or fuel may be provided to the burner 107 from outside the<br>
37<br><br>
system. Alternatively, in an indirect connection, an optional condenser 113 (shown in<br>
Figure 5) may be provided between the output 205 of valve 201 and the burner 107.<br>
In that case, water is removed from the second separated fuel exhaust stream before<br>
the this stream enters the burner 107. The water from the optional condenser may be<br>
provided into an optional steam generator which is heated by an exhaust stream of the<br>
fuel cell stack, as described in U.S. application serial number 11/124,120 filed on<br>
May 9, 2005. The steam generator may be positioned inside the hot box or in contact<br>
with a surface of the hot box. The steam generator provides water vapor (steam) into<br>
the fuel inlet stream. A single mixer may be used to mix the fuel inlet stream, the first<br>
separated fuel exhaust stream and the steam from the steam generator. The heat from<br>
the burner 107 may be provided to the reformer 123 to increase the temperature of the<br>
reformer 123. If desired, the stack air exhaust stream may be provided adjacent to the<br>
reformer 123 to also increase the temperature of the reformer, as disclosed in U.S.<br>
Application Serial Number 11/002,681, filed December 2, 2004, prior to being<br>
provided into the heat exchanger 127.<br>
[0116]	The fuel cell systems described herein may have other embodiments<br>
and configurations, as desired. Other components may be added if desired, as<br>
described, for example, in U.S. Application Serial Number 10/300,021, filed on<br>

on April 9, 2003, and in U.S. Application Serial Number 10/446,704, filed on May<br>
29, 2003 all incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Furthermore, it should<br>

and/or illustrated in any figure herein may also be used in systems and/or methods of<br>
