The present invention relates generally to measuring water hardness, and in particular to<br>
measuring, and compensating for, water hardness in a washing machine.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Machine washing systems typically employ cleaning agents that form a cleaning solution<br>
when mixed with water. Cleaning agents, such as detergents, breakdown and remove food or<br>
other soils and operate most effectively in alkaline environments. However, hard water ions<br>
(e.g., calcium and magnesium ions) present in the water supply of the washer will reduce the<br>
effectiveness of the detergent. Thus, chelating agents are added to the wash water to sequester<br>
the hard water ions. Typical chelants include, without limitation, nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA),<br>
ethylene diamene tetraacetic acid (EDTA) and tripolyphosphate (TPP).<br>
The water hardness (i.e., the concentration of hard water ions) is typically not known prior to<br>
beginning a wash operation, so the amount of chelant that needs to be added to the wash water<br>
to sequester the hard water ions is also not known.<br>
One approach to account for unknown water hardness is to add an excess amount of chelating<br>
agent to the detergent to sequester all possible hard water ions. However, this approach<br>
typically wastes a large amount of chelant. In addition, this approach is costly because<br>
chelating agents are expensive.<br>
Two approaches to determining when enough chelant has been added to completely sequester<br>
the hard water ions are described in U.S. Patent 4,334,881, entitled "Method and Apparatus<br>
for Automatic End-Point Detection in Tripolyphosphate Sequestration of Hardness." In one<br>
approach, TPP is slowly added to the wash water while the electrical conductivity of the wash<br>
water is monitored. Complete sequestration is determined by detecting when the maximum<br>
rate of change of conductivity with chelant addition occurs. In the second approach, if the pH<br>
of the washing solution is above 11 (to precipitate the magnesium ions), when the<br>
conductivity first increases substantially with TPP addition, 1.5 times more TPP is added to<br>
sequester all of the remaining calcium ions. Both of these approaches, however, tend to be<br>
quite slow and inaccurate.<br><br><br>
Thus, there is a need for improved methods and systems to measure water hardness and to<br>
determine the amount of chelating agent needed to sequester hard water ions.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The present invention overcomes the limitations and disadvantages described above by<br>
providing methods and systems to measure water hardness and to determine and dispense the<br>
amount of chelating agent needed to sequester the hard water ions.<br>
In one embodiment, a method for dispensing a chelant and a cleaning agent includes obtaining<br>
a first conductivity measurement and determining a first chelant amount based on the first<br>
conductivity measurement. The first chelant amount is added to a chamber from a chelant<br>
source and a second conductivity measurement is obtained. Based on the second conductivity<br>
measurement, a chelant factor is deteÏ€nined and stored. An amount of detergent is added to<br>
the chamber from a detergent source.<br>
In another embodiment, a method for detecting a change in water hardness includes obtaining<br>
a first conductivity measurement and determining a first chelant amount based on the first<br>
conductivity measurement. The first chelant amount is added to a chamber from a chelant<br>
source and a second conductivity measurement is obtained. Based on the second conductivity<br>
measurement, a current chelant factor is determined. A change in the water hardness is based<br>
on comparing the current chelant factor and a previous chelant factor.<br>
In still another embodiment, a method for detecting a change in water hardness includes<br>
adding chelant during each of a plurality of processing cycles to a chamber to sequester water<br>
hardness ions. A respective chelant factor is determined, where the chelant factor is related to<br>
water hardness for the respective processing cycle. The respective chelant factor for a current<br>
processing cycle is compared with at least one earlier determined chelant factor. When the<br>
comparing indicates a change in water hardness satisfying predefined criteria, a signal is<br>
generated.<br><br><br>
In still another embodiment, a method for identifying a decrease in water softening<br>
effectiveness includes obtaining a first conductivity measurement and determining a first<br>
chelant amount based on the first conductivity measurement. A first portion of the first<br>
chelant amount is added to a chamber from a chelant source and a second conductivity<br>
measurement is obtained. An effectiveness of water softening is determined and a second<br>
portion of the first chelant amount is added to the chamber from the chelant source based on<br>
the effectiveness. A third conductivity measurement is obtained and a chelant factor based on<br>
the third conductivity measurement is determined and stored.<br>
The value in knowing the water hardness is related to the potential to eliminate problems<br>
caused by uncontrolled water hardness and to reduce overuse of chelants. Water hardness can<br>
change for a variety of reasons, including changes in water supply sources, seasonal changes<br>
in aquifers, and water softener failures. This invention makes it is possible to easily detect<br>
these changes and to adjust the chelant accordingly, thereby saving chemical costs and<br>
improving wash results.	<br>

DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS<br>
Water hardness is measured in a novel manner using an electrical conductivity sensor, one or<br>
more chelating agents, and a computer-controlled chemical dispensing system.<br>
In some embodiments, an initial conductivity measurement of water in a washing chamber is<br>
made when a new fill cycle is detected. The maximum concentration of hard water ions that<br>
could correspond to the measured conductivity is determined, i.e., it is assumed that all of the<br>
conductivity is due to calcium and/or magnesium ions in the water even though other ions<br>
may in fact be contributing to the measured conductivity. Enough chelating agent is then<br>
added to the chamber to sequester this maximum concentration of hard water ions and the<br>
conductivity is measured again. Using the two conductivity measurements, the actual<br>
concentration of hard water ions is determined. A chelant factor based on the actual<br>
concentration of hard water ions is then used to determine the amount of chelant to be added<br>
for each subsequent wash cycle to sequester all of the hard water ions.<br>
Methods, systems, and computer programs are described that measure water hardness and that<br>
determine and dispense the amount of chelating agent needed to sequester hard water ions.<br>
Reference will be made to certain embodiments of the invention, examples of which are<br>
illustrated in the accompanying drawings. While the invention will be described in<br>
conjunction with the embodiments, it will be understood that it is not intended to limit the<br>
invention to these particular embodiments alone. On the contrary, the invention is intended to<br>
cover alternatives, modifications and equivalents that are within the spirit and scope of the<br>
invention as defined by the appended claims.<br><br><br>
Moreover, in the following description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a<br>
thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it will be apparent to one of<br>
ordinary skill in the art that the invention may be practiced without these particular details, hi<br>
other instances, methods, procedures, and components that are well known to those of<br>
ordinary skill in the art are not described in detail to avoid obscuring aspects of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic diagram illustrating an exemplary washing system according to an<br>
embodiment of the invention. Washing system 100 includes a washing chamber 102, a control<br>
system 104, a cleaning agent dispenser 106, a chelant dispenser 108, and a water supply 110.<br>
In some embodiments, washing system 100 is a commercial dishwasher. In other<br>
embodiments, washing system 100 is a consumer dishwasher, a commercial clothes washer,<br>
or a consumer clothes washer.<br>
Washing chamber 102 is a connected to a drain 112.<br>
Control system 104 is connected to meter 114, conductivity sensor 118, cleaning agent<br>
dispenser 106 and chelant dispenser 108. Meter 114 monitors the flow of water from water<br>
supply 110 into washing chamber 102.<br>
Conductivity sensor 118 can be a typical sensor that is normally used to measure the detergent<br>
concentration in a commercial dishwasher. Details on this type of sensor and the electronics<br>
and control associated with it are described in U.S. Patents 6,223,129 and 6,529,841, the<br>
contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Other types of conductivity<br>
measurement systems will also work. Conductivity sensor 118 may also include a temperature<br>
sensor so that raw conductivity measurements can be compensated back to 20Â°C using the<br>
standard 1.8%/Â° C compensation factor.<br>
Dispensers 106 and 108 are similar to those used to dispense chemicals into a commercial<br>
dishwasher. Exemplary dispensers are described in U.S. Patent 5,647,391, the contents of<br>
which are hereby incorporated by reference. The chemical forms of the cleaning agent and the<br>
chelant may be either liquid or solid (powder). Control system 104 should be capable of<br>
controlling the addition of the chemicals in accurate dose amounts. Typical dose amounts are<br><br><br>
between 5 cc's (or 5 grams) and 250 cc's (or 250 grams). Typical accuracy should be +/- 5%<br>
of the target dose amount, or +/- 1 cc, or +1- 1 gram). These numbers and accuracies are for<br>
typical commercial dishwashers and should not be considered as limits on the scope of the<br>
invention.<br>
The chemicals serve two purposes. Their primary role is to support the cleaning process of the<br>
dishwasher. Their secondary role is as reagents for water hardness measurements. In some<br>
embodiments, the detergent is split into two separate chemicals; one contains the primary<br>
cleaning ingredients and the other contains the chelant. The chelant is used to control<br>
(sequester) the hard water ions. To create a complete detergent, the cleaning chemical, often<br>
called the "chemical energy" or "CE" component, is added to the wash tank to a concentration<br>
level determined by the soil levels that will be present (less if light soil is most probable and<br>
more if heavy soil is more likely). The chelant, often called the "chelation value" or "CV"<br>
component, is added to a concentration level that will sequester all of the hardness ions. Since<br>
the CV component is quite costly, it is most cost effective to not dose more chelant than is<br>
required.<br>
Figure 2 is a block diagram illustrating a control system according to an embodiment of the<br>
invention. Control system 104 typically includes processing unit (CPU) 222, one or more<br>
network or other communications interfaces 232, memory 202, and one or more<br>
communication buses 224 for interconnecting these components. Control system 104<br>
optionally may include a user interface 116 comprising a display device 228 and a keyboard<br>
230. Memory 202 may include high speed random access memory and may also include non-<br>
volatile memory, such as one or more magnetic disk storage devices. Memory 202 may<br>
optionally include one or more storage devices remotely located from the CPU 222. hi some<br>
embodiments, the memory 202 stores the following programs, modules and data structures, or<br>
a subset thereof:<br>
â€¢	an operating system 204 that includes procedures for handling various basic system services<br>
and for performing hardware dependent tasks;<br>
â€¢	a communication module 206 that is used for connecting control system 104 to other<br>
computers (e.g., for remote monitoring of washing system 100) or devices via one or more<br><br><br>
communication interfaces 232 (wired or wireless); the communication interfaces may include<br>
a network interface (for connecting to the Internet, a local area network, or the like), an<br>
RS232 interface, or any other suitable interface;<br>
â€¢	a water control module 208 that regulates the amount of water in chamber 102; â€¢ a chelant<br>
control module 210 that regulates the amount of chelant added to chamber<br>
102 by dispenser 108;<br>
â€¢	a detergent control module 212 that regulates the amount of cleaning agent added to<br>
chamber 102 by dispenser 106;<br>
â€¢	a conductivity sensor module 214 that controls or monitors the operation of sensor 118;<br>
â€¢	a hardness calculation module 216 that determines hard water ion concentrations and chelant<br>
dose amounts based at least in part on conductivity measurements and water volume;<br>
â€¢	a comparison module 218 that compares current hard water ion concentrations and/or<br>
chelant factors with previous values to identify changes in water hardness and/or water<br>
softener effectiveness; and<br>
â€¢	a wash module 220 that controls the washing process in chamber 102.<br>
Each of the above identified modules corresponds to a set of instructions for performing a<br>
function described above. These modules (i.e., sets of instructions) need not be implemented<br>
as separate software programs, procedures or modules, and thus various subsets of these<br>
modules may be combined or otherwise re-arranged in various embodiments. In some<br>
embodiments, memory 202 may store a subset of the modules and data structures identified<br>
above. Furthermore, memory 202 may store additional modules and data structures not<br>
described above.<br>
Figure 3 is a flow chart of an exemplary process for measuring water hardness and dispensing<br>
a chelant and a cleaning agent according to an embodiment of the invention.<br><br><br>
Control system 104 determines if a new fill cycle for washing system 100 has occurred (302).<br>
In a new fill cycle, chamber 102 is filled with clean water from supply 110 prior to the start of<br>
washing. Various methods can be used to sense when chamber 110 has been drained and<br>
refilled with clean water. U.S. patent 4,509,543 describes a method that uses a conductivity<br>
sensor, such as sensor 118. Alternatively, a float switch could be used to sense a tank drain<br>
and refill. If a new fill cycle has occurred, a first conductivity measurement of the (clean)<br>
water is obtained (304), for example by conductivity sensor module 214 using sensor 118.<br>
The first conductivity measurement is converted to a maximum hard water ion concentration<br>
(306). hi some embodiments., hardness calculation module 216 uses an equation or lookup<br>
table relating conductivity to hard water ion concentration to make the conversion. Figure 4A<br>
is a schematic graph of electrical conductivity versus hard water ion concentration at a<br>
particular temperature. The data for such a graph (and the corresponding equations or lookup<br>
table) can be obtained by measuring the conductivity of initially pure water samples as known<br>
amounts of hard water ions are added. These measurements can also be done at a series of<br>
temperatures so that the temperature dependence of the conductivity can be accounted for.<br>
Thus, a first conductivity measurement (e.g., A in Figure 4A) can be converted to a maximum<br>
possible hard water ion concentration (e.g., B in Figure 4A). Hard water ion concentrations<br>
are typically expressed in ppm (parts per million) of calcium ions.<br>
Based on the first conductivity measurement, an amount of chelant to be added to the water in<br>
chamber 102 is determined (308). In some embodiments, the chelant amount is an amount<br>
that is projected to be sufficient to fully sequester water hardness ions in the chamber. For<br>
example, if a 1:1 molar ratio of chelant to hard water ions is needed to fully sequester the hard<br>
water ions, then the amount of chelant needed is given by:<br>
Chelant volume = (maximum possible hard water ion concentration)-(volume of water<br>
in chamber)<br>
The amount of chelant needed can also be expressed as a mass by multiplying the preceding<br>
equation by the appropriate density.<br><br><br>
In some embodiments, hardness calculation module 216 calculates the chelant amount<br>
required based on the maximum possible hard water ion concentration (derived from the first<br>
conductivity measurement) and the amount of water that meter 114 determines has gone into<br>
chamber 102 during the new fill cycle.<br>
The calculated chelant amount is added to chamber 102 from chelant source 108 (310). The<br>
chelant can be added with a peristaltic metering pump (or any other suitable liquid pump) if<br>
the chelant is a liquid or with a powder measuring device (also called a powder metering<br>
device) if the chelant is a powder. After the chelant is thoroughly mixed with the water in<br>
chamber 102, a second conductivity measurement is obtained (312). Complete mixing can be<br>
sensed by monitoring for stability in the conductivity measurement. Alternately, the system<br>
can wait a predefined amount of time after the dispensing operation to perform the second<br>
conductivity measurement.<br>
Based on the second conductivity measurement, the actual hard water ion concentration is<br>
determined (314). This determination can be explained with the aid of Figure 4B, which is a<br>
schematic graph of electrical conductivity versus the amount of chelating agent added for<br>
three different water samples with the same initial conductivity (A in Figure 4B), but different<br>
actual hard water ion concentrations.<br>
As shown in U.S. Patent 4,334,881 , the conductivity increases slowly with added chelant<br>
until the hard water ions are fully sequestered. Full sequestration typically occurs at a 1:1<br>
molar ratio of hard water ions to chelant elements. Once the hard water ions are fully<br>
sequestered, the conductivity rises more rapidly with additional chelant, at about the same rate<br>
as would occur in water containing no hard water ions. This behavior explains the change in<br>
slope in lines 402 and 404. The slope after complete sequestration may depend on which<br>
chelant is being added. This slope may be determined by adding chelant to pure water<br>
samples and measuring the change in conductivity.<br>
Line 404 shows schematically the conductivity behavior for a water sample where the actual<br>
hard water ion concentration is the concentration derived from the first conductivity<br>
measurement (i.e., B derived from A in Figure 4A). In other words, for this sample, the<br>
assumption that essentially all of the conductivity is due to hard water ions is correct.<br><br><br>
Consequently, for this sample, the amount of chelating agent added (C in Figure 4B) is just<br>
enough to fully sequester the hard water ions; the second conductivity measured is D in<br>
Figure 4B; and no excess chelant is wasted.<br>
Line 400 shows schematically the conductivity behavior expected for a water sample where<br>
the hard water ion concentration is negligible. In other words, for this sample, all of the<br>
conductivity is due to ions other than hard water ions. For this sample, no chelating agent is<br>
needed because there are no hard water ions to sequester. Consequently, there is no slow<br>
increase in conductivity for this sample. Instead, the conductivity rises rapidly as soon as<br>
chelant is added to the water, ending up at F in Figure 4B when the amount of chelant added<br>
is C.<br>
Line 402 shows schematically the conductivity behavior expected for a water sample where<br>
the hard water ion concentration is not negligible, but is less than the concentration derived<br>
from the first conductivity measurement. In other words, for this sample, only part of the<br>
conductivity is due to hard water ions. For this sample, the amount of chelating agent needed<br>
to sequester the hard water ions is G in Figure 4B. When the amount of chelant added to this<br>
sample is C, then some chelating agent (i.e., C - G in Figure 4B) is wasted and the second<br>
measured conductivity is E in Figure 4B.<br>
The second conductivity measured for samples with only a portion of the conductivity due to<br>
hard water ions varies in an approximately linear manner between F (no conductivity due to<br>
hard water ions) and D (all conductivity due to hard water ions) in Figure 4B. Thus, if the<br>
slopes before and after complete sequestration are known for a given chelating agent (e.g.,<br>
from prior conductivity measurements on water samples with controlled chelant<br>
concentrations) and the conductivities before and after addition of the chelating agent are<br>
measured, the second conductivity measurement can be converted to the actual hard water ion<br>
concentration. In some embodiments, the conductivity versus amount of chelant slopes before<br>
and after complete sequestration are stored for one, or two or more chelants in memory 202<br>
and used by hardness calculation module 216 to convert the second measured conductivity to<br>
an actual hard water ion concentration.<br><br><br>
In one embodiment, conductivity measurements were made at 20oC, resulting in the<br>
determination of the following first-order relationships:<br>
In Figure 4A:<br>
B = 1.14xA<br>
where<br>
A = clean water conductivity, in uS/cm, and<br>
B = maximum possible hard water ion concentration, ppm calcium ions.<br>
In Figure 4B:<br>
D=1.25xA<br>
and<br>
F = (1.65xA) + 304uS/cm<br>
where<br>
A = the clean water conductivity, in uS/cm,<br>
D = the conductivity measured after an amount of chelant C is added and mixed when all of<br>
the initial conductivity was due to hard water ions, and<br>
F = the conductivity measured after an amount of chelant C is added and mixed when none of<br>
the initial conductivity was due to hard water ions.<br>
These equations, in conjunction with the two conductivity measurements (i.e., the clean water<br>
conductivity and the conductivity measured after the chelant is added and mixed) can also be<br>
used to calculate the actual hard water ion concentration.<br>
In some embodiments, tables are used, rather than equations, to calculate the actual hard water<br>
ion concentration. In the tables, for each starting conductivity (interpolation can be used to<br>
keep the table size reasonable), there is an array of possible ending conductivities that relate<br>
to the percentage of the maximum possible hard water ion concentration. The range would<br>
extend from 100% to 0%. In other words, while the maximum possible hard water ion<br>
concentration may have been 700 ppm, the second conductivity measurement may indicate<br>
that only 30% of the ions were hard water ions and that the actual hard water ion<br>
concentration is only 210 ppm. Table 1 is an exemplary table.<br><br><br>
In some embodiments, the actual hard water ion concentration can be compared to previous<br>
measurements to detect a significant change in the hard water ion concentration (316), for<br>
example by using comparison module 218. More specifically, the actual hard water ion<br>
concentration determined at each refilling of the water tank may be compared with one or<br>
more previously hard water ion concentrations determined at prior refillings of the water tank.<br>
Alternately, the current hard water ion concentration determination may be compared with an<br>
average of two or more previously hard water ion concentrations. A significant change in the<br>
hard water ion concentration determination (e.g., an increase of N percent, such as 20 percent,<br>
or an increase of a predefined amount, such as 150 ppm) may indicate a failure of a water<br>
softener device, or may indicate another condition or problem requiring the attention of a<br>
repair person. When the comparison at 316 indicates that the current hard water ion<br>
concentration is significantly higher than prior hard water ion concentration determinations, a<br>
remedial action maybe initiated. The remedial action may include turning on a warning light,<br>
sending a message to another device or to a particular email address or the like, or other<br>
appropriate action. In one embodiment, the remedial action is undertaken only when the new,<br>
higher hard water ion concentration determination is confirmed during a subsequent refilling<br>
of the water tank.<br>
In some embodiments, the change in water hardness at 316 is detected by comparing a chelant<br>
factor computed (318) for a current water fill cycle with the chelant factor computed for one<br>
or more prior water fill cycles, and determining whether the difference (if any) exceeds a<br>
predefined threshold. In these embodiments, and in some other embodiments as well,<br>
detection operation 316 occurs after the calculation of the chelant factor at 318.<br><br>
An amount of chelant needed to sequester the actual hard water ion concentration is<br>
calculated (318). In some embodiments, this calculation uses a chelant factor. As used herein,<br>
a chelant factor is a multiplier used in the calculation of the amount of chelant needed for<br>
sequestration that compensates for the fact that only a portion of the measured conductivity<br>
may be due to hard water ions. The chelant factor incorporates or corresponds to the fraction<br>
of the water conductivity that is actually due to hard water ions. If a 1 : 1 molar ratio of<br>
chelant to hard water ions is needed to fully sequester the hard water ions, then the amount of<br>
chelant needed when additional water is added to chamber 102 is given by:<br>
Chelant volume = (chelant factor)(maximum possible hard water ion<br>
concentration)(incremental volume of water added to chamber)<br>
If a molar ratio other than 1 : 1 is needed for a particular chelant to fully sequester the hard<br>
water ions, this ratio can be incorporated into the chelant factor. More generally, the chelant<br>
factor is a multiplier for determining the amount of chelant (by volume or weight) needed to<br>
fully sequester the hard water ions based on a conductivity measurement and the incremental<br>
amount of water. Thus, in some embodiments, the chelant factor may also incorporate a<br>
conversion factor that relates a measured conductivity to a maximum possible hard water ion<br>
concentration.<br>
For line 402 in Figure 4B, the chelant factor is G/C or, equivalently, (F-E)/(F-D). The chelant<br>
factor, which is based on the second conductivity measurement, the first conductivity<br>
measurement, and the conductivity slopes before and after complete sequestration, is<br>
determined and stored in memory 202 (e.g., by hardness calculation module 216).<br>
An amount of detergent is added (320) to chamber 102 from a detergent source, such as<br>
cleaning agent dispenser 106, and washing (322) is performed by washing system 100.<br>
In some embodiments, such as commercial washing machines, chamber 102 is not completely<br>
drained and refilled with water between each wash cycle. Instead, an incremental amount of<br>
water is added to chamber 102 that, in turn, needs an incremental<br>
amount of chelating agent and detergent added as well. In such cases, control system 104<br>
determines that there is not a new fill cycle (302).<br><br><br>
The incremental amount of water added from water supply 110 to chamber 102 is determined,<br>
for example using meter 114. A second chelant amount in accordance with the amount of<br>
added water and the chelant factor is determined using the equation given above. The second<br>
chelant amount is added to chamber 102 from chelant source 108 (324).<br>
In addition, an incremental amount of detergent is added (320) to chamber 102 from a<br>
detergent source, such as cleaning agent dispenser 106, and additional washing (322) is<br>
performed by washing system 100.<br>
In some embodiments, with each new fill cycle, a current chelant factor is determined based<br>
on a second conductivity measurement, a first conductivity measurement, and the<br>
conductivity slopes before and after complete sequestration, using the process described<br>
above. A change in water hardness is determined based on the current chelant factor and a<br>
previous chelant factor. An increase in water hardness is identified when the current chelant<br>
factor is greater than the previous chelant factor.<br>
In some embodiments, during each of a plurality of processing cycles, chelant is added to a<br>
chamber to sequester water hardness ions and a chelant factor is determined for each<br>
processing cycle using the process described above. As explained above, each chelant factor<br>
relates to the water hardness for the respective processing cycle. The chelant factor for a<br>
current processing cycle is compared with at least one earlier determined chelant factor. When<br>
the comparison indicates a change in water hardness satisfying some predefined criteria, a<br>
signal such as a visual and/or auditory alarm, or an electronic message transmitted to another<br>
device, is generated. In some embodiments, the predefined criteria include the change in<br>
chelant factor being greater than a predefined amount.<br>
The water hardness measurement processes described above are based on adding an amount<br>
of chelant equal to the maximum that could possibly be required (308 and 310). In most cases,<br>
this will not cause a large waste of chelant because it is only done once for each tank drain<br>
and fill cycle and because the ions in the clean water will typically be mostly hard water ions.<br>
However, an exception to the typical case occurs when an ion exchange water softener is<br>
used. When the water softener is working properly, most of the ions will be sodium and not<br><br><br>
require sequestering. As described below with respect to Figure 5, control system 104 and the<br>
hardness measurement process can be made to detect that a softener is employed. If softener<br>
use is detected, then control system 104 adds only a fraction of the calculated maximum<br>
chelant dose (308 / 508). If the conductivity rises at a rate that indicates the softener is<br>
working, then no more chelant is added. If the conductivity rises slowly with chelant,<br>
indicating at least moderate hardness, then the rest of the chelant dose is added and the normal<br>
hardness measurement is performed. In some embodiments, control system 104 detects that a<br>
softener is in use if the percentage of actual hardness calculated in the normal measurement is<br>
less than 25% of the potential maximum hard water ion concentration. This embodiment<br>
could also be useful in cases where there is a natural occurrence of non-hard water ions with<br>
few hard water ions present.<br>
Figure 5 is a flow chart of an exemplary process for measuring water hardness, dispensing a<br>
chelant and a cleaning agent, and identifying a decrease in water softening effectiveness<br>
according to an embodiment of the invention. This process builds on the exemplary process<br>
shown in Figure 3 and discussed above, so analogous steps or operations that are already<br>
explained in detail above will only be briefly discussed here.<br>
Control system 104 determines if a new fill cycle for washing system 100 has occurred (502).<br>
If so, a first conductivity measurement of the wash water is obtained (504). The first<br>
conductivity measurement is converted to a maximum hard water ion concentration (506).<br>
Based on the first conductivity measurement, an amount of chelant to be added to the water in<br>
chamber 102 is determined (508). In some embodiments, the chelant amount is an amount<br>
that is projected to be sufficient to fully sequester water hardness ions in the chamber.<br>
Control system 104 determines if a softener is present (526). In some embodiments, this<br>
determination can be made based on a previous measurement of water hardness finding less<br>
than a predetermined amount of the conductivity due to hard water ions (e.g., less than 25%).<br>
In some embodiments, this determination can be made based on user input (e.g., a flag or<br>
other value may be stored in the control system 104 based on a user input to the control<br>
system).<br><br><br>
If softener is known or believed to be present, just a portion of the calculated maximum<br>
chelant dose is added to chamber 102 (528) from chelant dispenser 108. After thoroughly<br>
mixing the added chelant, a second conductivity measurement is obtained (530). In some<br>
embodiments, the amount of chelant added at 528 is sufficient to distinguish between water<br>
having a low, expected concentration of hard water ions (e.g., a concentration similar to what<br>
was determined during one or more previous water cycles, or a predetermined concentration<br>
consistent with the use of a water softener) and water having an unexpectedly high<br>
concentration of hard water ions. This amount of chelant will typically be much less (e-g-, at<br>
least 50 percent less) than the amount of chelant that would be required if all the ions<br>
contributing to the measured conductivity were attributable to hard water ions.<br>
In some embodiments, the effectiveness of the water softening is determined as follows. If the<br>
added chelant creates a rapid rise in conductivity, the softener is working properly (532) and<br>
no more chelant needs to be added. The detergent is added (520) and washing begins (522).<br>
Conversely, if the added chelant creates a slow rise in conductivity, the softening is not<br>
effective (532) and a second portion of the maximum chelant dose is added to chamber 102<br>
(534). In some embodiments, the second portion equals the maximum chelant dose less the<br>
first chelant portion (i.e., the second portion is the remaining amount of the maximum chelant<br>
dose). After thoroughly mixing the added chelant, a third conductivity measurement is made<br>
(512) and the actual hard water ion concentration is determined (514). In some embodiments,<br>
control system 104 detects that a softener is in use if the percentage of actual hardness<br>
calculated in the normal measurement is less than a predetermined amount (e.g., less than<br>
25%) of the maximum possible hard water ion concentration (516). An amount of chelant<br>
needed to sequester the actual hard water ion concentration is calculated (5IS). As explained<br>
above, this calculation uses a chelant factor in some embodiments. The chelant factor based<br>
on the third conductivity measurement is determined (e.g., by hardness calculation module<br>
216) and stored (e.g., in memory 202). The detergent is added (520) and washing begins<br>
(522).<br>
If softener is not known or believed to be present (526), the calculated maximum chelant dose<br>
is added to chamber 102 (510). After thoroughly mixing the added chelant, a conductivity<br>
measurement is made (512) and the actual hard water ion concentration is determined (514).<br><br><br>
In some embodiments, control system 104 detects that a softener is in use if the percentage of<br>
actual hardness calculated in the normal measurement is less than a predetermined amount<br>
(e.g., less than 25%) of the maximum possible hard water ion concentration (516). An amount<br>
of chelant needed to sequester the actual hard water ion concentration is calculated (518). As<br>
explained above, this calculation uses a chelant factor in some embodiments. The detergent is<br>
added (520) and washing begins (522).<br>
If this is not a new fill cycle (502), an incremental amount of water is added to chamber 102<br>
that, in turn, needs an incremental amount of chelating agent and detergent added as well. The<br>
incremental amount of water added from water supply 110 to chamber 102 is determined, for<br>
example using meter 114. A second chelant amount in accordance with, the amount of added<br>
water and the chelant factor is determined using the equation given above. The second chelant<br>
amount is added to chamber 102 from chelant source 108 (524). An amount of detergent is<br>
added (520) to chamber 102 from a detergent source and washing (522) is performed by<br>
washing system 100.<br>
In addition to detecting and compensating for a failed water softener, control system 104 can<br>
also warn the user that it is time to recharge the water softener. Control system 104 can<br>
automatically increase the chelant feed from dispenser 108 while the softener is "leaking hard<br>
water" and then decrease it when the softener system or device has been serviced and restored<br>
to normal operation.<br>
In some embodiments, the determinations at 526 and 516 may also be used to detect the<br>
presence of soft water, with low hard water ion concentrations, even when a softener system<br>
is not in use. By detecting that the washing system is receiving soft water, the amount of<br>
chelant used at the beginning of each fill cycle may be significantly reduced (e.g., by 50<br>
percent or more).<br>
In some embodiments, to reduce the amount of chelant wasted by repeated determinations of<br>
the chelant factor, a new chelant factor determination is performed only once every N fill<br>
cycles, where N is equal to 2, 3, 4 or other larger number. In some other embodiments, when<br>
the chelant factor is below a threshold value (e.g., below a value corresponding to 50% of the<br>
ions comprising hard water ions), the chelant factor is assumed to be correct from one fill<br><br><br>
cycle to the next, but is tested at the beginning of each new fill cycle, or each Nth new fill<br>
cycle. The chelant factor is tested or checked by adding an amount of chelant that falls<br>
between a low value corresponding to the previously determined chelant factor and a high<br>
value corresponding to the amount of chelant that would be needed if all the ions associated<br>
with the current conductivity measurement were hard water ions, and then taking a new<br>
conductivity measurement, computing a new chelant factor and comparing the new chelant<br>
factor with the previously computed chelant factor. By using less chelant than the<br>
aforementioned high value, the total amount of chelant used is reduced. In all of these<br>
embodiments, a single chelant dispensing event or operation is used for each wash cycle,<br>
except in the rare situations in which a water softener system has failed or a significant<br>
change in water hardness is detected.<br>
Although some of various drawings illustrate a number of logical stages in a particular order,<br>
stages which are not order dependent may be reordered and other stages may be combined or<br>
broken out. While some reordering or other groupings are specifically mentioned, others will<br>
be obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art and so do not present an exhaustive list of<br>
alternatives. Moreover, it should be recognized that the control system could be implemented<br>
in hardware, firmware, software or any combination thereof.<br>

ABSTRACT<br><br>
METHOD FOR DETECTING A CHANGE IN WATER HARDNESS<br>
Prior to adding detergent or chelant, the conductivity of water in a<br>
washing chamber (102) is measured. The maximum concentration of hard<br>
water ions that could correspond to the measured conductivity is<br>
determined, i.e., it is assumed that all of the conductivity is from calcium<br>
and/or magnesium ions in the water even though other ions may in fact be<br>
contributing to the measured conductivity. Enough chelating agent is<br>
added to the chamber to sequester this maximum concentration of hard<br>
water ions and the conductivity is measured again. Using the two<br>
conductivity measurements, the actual concentration of hard water ions is<br>
determined. A chelant factor based on the actual concentration of hard<br>
water ions is then used to determine the amount of chelant to be added for<br>
subsequent wash cycles to sequester all of the hard water ions.</td>
