GROUPED EXPOSED METAL HEATERS<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
1-	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to methods and systems for heating and production of hydrocarbons,<br>
hydrogen, and/or other products from various subsurface formations such as hydrocarbon containing formations.<br>
Embodiments relate to heater patterns and production well locations for treating hydrocarbon containing formations.<br>
2.	Description of Related Art<br>
Hydrocarbons obtained from subterranean formations are often used as energy resources, as feedstocks, and as consumer products. Concerns over depletion of available hydrocarbon resources and concerns over declining overall quality of produced hydrocarbons have led to development of processes for more efficient recovery, processing and/or use of available hydrocarbon resources. In situ processes may be used to remove hydrocarbon materials from subterranean formations. Chemical and/or physical properties of hydrocarbon material in a subterranean formation may need to be changed to allow hydrocarbon material to be more easily removed from the subterranean formation. The chemical and physical changes may include in situ reactions that produce removable fluids, composition changes, solubility changes, density changes, phase changes, and/or viscosity changes of the hydrocarbon material in the formation. A fluid may be, but is not limited to, a gas, a liquid, an emulsion, a slurry, and/or a stream of solid particles that has flow characteristics similar to liquid flow.<br>
Heaters may be placed in wellbores to heat a formation during an in situ process. Examples of in situ processes utilizing downhole heaters are illustrated in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,634,961 to Ljungstrom; 2,732,195 to Ljungstrom; 2,780,450 to Ljungstrom; 2,789,805 to Ljungstrom; 2,923,535 to Ljungstrom; and 4,886,118 to Van Meurs et al.<br>
Application of heat to oil shale formations is described in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,923,535 to Ljungstrom and 4,886,118 to Van Meurs et al. Heat may be applied to the oil shale formation to pyrolyze kerogen in the oil shale formation. The heat may also fracture the formation to increase permeability of the formation. The increased permeability may allow formation fluid to travel to a production well where the fluid is removed from the oil shale formation. In some processes disclosed by Ljungstrom, for example, an oxygen containing gaseous medium is introduced to a permeable stratum, preferably while still hot from a preheating step, to initiate combustion.<br>
A heat source may be used to heat a subterranean formation. Electric heaters may be used to heat the subterranean formation by radiation and/or conduction. An electric heater may resistively heat an element. U.S. Patent No. 2,548,360 to Germain describes an electric heating element placed in a viscous oil in a wellbore. The heater element heats and thins the oil to allow the oil to be pumped from the wellbore. U.S. Patent No. 4,716,960 to Eastlund et al. describes electrically heating tubing of a petroleum well by passing a relatively low voltage current through the tubing to prevent formation of solids. U.S. Patent No. 5,065,818 to Van Egmond describes an electric heating element that is cemented into a well borehole without a casing surrounding the heating element.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,023,554 to Vinegar et al describes an electric heating element that is positioned in a casing. The heating element generates radiant energy that heats the casing. A granular solid fill material may be placed between the casing and the formation. The casing may conductively heat the fill material, which in turn conductively heats the formation.<br>
 <br>
t    Exposed metal heaters may leak current into the formation. Current leakage into the formation may cause undesirable and/or non-uniform heating in the formation. Thus, it is advantageous to have a heating system that provides uniform heat along a length of the heater; heats the subsurface formation efficiently; and/or current leakage between heaters and into the formation is inhibited.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The following description generally relates to systems and methods for treating hydrocarbons in the    
hydrocarbons" are generally defined as molecules formed primarily by carbon and hydrogen atoms. Hydrocarbons may also include other elements such as, but not limited to, halogens, metallic elements, nitrogen, oxygen, and/or sulfur. Hydrocarbons may be, but are not limited to, kerogen, bitumen, pyrobitumen, oils, natural mineral waxes, and asphaltites. Hydrocarbons may be located in or adjacent to mineral matrices in the earth. Matrices may include, but are not limited to, sedimentary rock, sands, silicilytes, carbonates, diatomites, and other porous media. "Hydrocarbon fluids" are fluids that include hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbon fluids may include, entrain, or be entrained in non-hydrocarbon fluids such as hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, water, and ammonia.<br>
A "formation" includes one or more hydrocarbon containing layers, one or more non-hydrocarbon layers, an overburden, and/or an underburden. The "overburden" and/or the "underburden" include one or more different types of impermeable materials. For example, overburden and/or underburden may include rock, shale, mudstone, or wet/tight carbonate. In some embodiments of in situ conversion processes, the overburden and/or the underburden may include a hydrocarbon containing layer or hydrocarbon containing layers that are relatively impermeable and are not subjected to temperatures during in situ conversion processing that result in significant characteristic changes of the hydrocarbon containing layers of the overburden and/or the underburden. For example, the underburden may contain shale or mudstone, but the underburden is not allowed to heat to pyrolysis temperatures during the in situ conversion process. In some cases, the overburden and/or the underburden may be somewhat permeable.<br>
A "heater" is any system or heat source for generating heat in a well or a near wellbore region. Heaters may be, but are not limited to, electric heaters, burners, combustors that react with material in or produced from a formation, and/or combinations thereof<br>
 <br>
An "in situ conversion process" refers to a process of heating a hydrocarbon containing formation from heat sources to raise the temperature of at least a portion of the formation above a pyrolysis temperature so that pyrolyzation fluid is produced in the formation.<br>
"Insulated conductor" refers to any elongated material that is able to conduct electricity and that is covered, in whole or in part, by an electrically insulating material<br>
An elongated member may be a bare metal heater or an exposed metal heater. "Bare metal" and "exposed metal" refer to metals that do not include a layer of electrical insulation, such as mineral insulation, that is designed to provide electrical insulation for the metal throughout an operating temperature range of the elongated member. Bare metal and exposed metal may encompass a metal that includes a corrosion inhibiter such as a naturally occurring oxidation layer, an applied oxidation layer, and/or a film. Bare metal and exposed metal include metals with polymeric or other types of electrical insulation that cannot retain electrical insulating properties at typical operating temperature of the elongated member. Such material may be placed on the metal and may be thermally degraded during use of the heater.<br>
"Temperature limited heater" generally refers to a heater that regulates heat output (for example, reduces heat output) above a specified temperature without the use of external controls such as temperature controllers, power regulators, rectifiers, or other devices. Temperature limited heaters may be AC (alternating current) or modulated (for example, "chopped") DC (direct current) powered electrical resistance heaters.<br>
"Curie temperature" is the temperature above which a ferromagnetic material loses all of its ferromagnetic properties. In addition to losing all of its ferromagnetic properties above the Curie temperature, the ferromagnetic material begins to lose its ferromagnetic properties when an increasing electrical current is passed through the ferromagnetic material.<br>
'Time-varying cuirenf * refers to electrical current that produces skin effect electricity flow in a ferromagnetic conductor and has a magnitude that varies with time. Time-varying current includes both alternating current (AC) and modulated direct current (DC).<br>
"Alternating current (AC)" refers to a time-varying current that reverses direction substantially sinusoidally. AC produces skin effect electricity flow in a ferromagnetic conductor.<br>
"Modulated direct current (DC)" refers to any substantially non-sinusoidal time-varying current that produces skin effect electricity flow in a ferromagnetic conductor.<br>
"Turndown ratio" for the temperature limited heater is the ratio of the highest AC or modulated DC resistance below the Curie temperature to the lowest resistance above the Curie temperature for a given current<br>
In the context of reduced heat output heating systems, apparatus, and methods, the term "automatically" means such systems, apparatus, and methods function in a certain way without the use of external control (for example, external controllers such as a controller with a temperature sensor and a feedback loop, PID controller, or predictive controller).<br>
The term "wellbore" refers to a hole in a formation made by drilling or insertion of a conduit into the formation. A wellbore may have a substantially circular cross section, or another cross-sectional shape. As used herein, the terms "well" and "opening," when referring to an opening in the formation may be used interchangeably<br>
with the term "wellbore."<br>
&gt;<br>
'Triad" refers to a group of three items (for example, heaters, wellbores, or other objects) coupled together.<br>
 <br>
Hydrocarbons in tonnanons mavarrious various ways to produce many different products. In certain embodiments, hydrocarbons in formations are treated in stages. FIG. 1 depicts an illustration of stages of heating the hydrocarbon containing formation. FIG. 1 also depicts an example of yield ("Y") in barrels of oil equivalent per ton (y axis) of formation fluids from the formation versus temperature ("T") of the heated formation in degrees Celsius (x axis).<br>
Desorption of methane and vaporization of water occurs during stage 1 heating. Heating of the formation through stage 1 may be performed as quickly as possible. For example, when the hydrocarbon containing formation is initially heated, hydrocarbons in the formation desorb adsorbed methane. The desorbed methane may be produced from the formation. If the hydrocarbon containing formation is heated further, water in the hydrocarbon containing formation is vaporized. Water may occupy, in some hydrocarbon containing formations, between 10% and 50% of the pore volume in the formatioa In other formations, water occupies larger or smaller portions of the pore volume. . Water typically is vaporized in a formation between 160 °C and 285 °C at pressures of 600 kPa absolute to 7000 kPa absolute. In some embodiments, the vaporized water produces wettability changes in the formation and/or increased formation pressure. The wettability changes and/or increased pressure may affect pyrolysis reactions or other reactions in the formation. In certain embodiments, the vaporized water is produced from the formation. In other embodiments, the vaporized water is used for steam extraction and/or distillation in the formation or outside the formation. Removing the water from and increasing the pore volume in the formation increases the storage space for hydrocarbons in the pore volume.<br>
In certain embodiments, after stage 1 heating, the formation is heated further, such that a temperature in the formation reaches (at least) an initial pyrolyzation temperature (such as a temperature at the lower end of the temperature range shown as stage 2). Hydrocarbons in the formation may be pyrolyzed throughout stage 2. A pyrolysis temperature range varies depending on the types of hydrocarbons in the formation. The pyrolysis temperaturcrange may include temperatures between 250 °C and 900 °C. The pyrolysis temperature range for producing desired products may extend through only a portion of the total pyrolysis temperature range. In some embodiments, the pyrolysis temperature range for producing desired products may include temperatures between 250 °C and 400 °C or temperatures between 270 °C and 350 °C. If a temperature of hydrocarbons in the formation is slowly raised through the temperature range from 250 °C to 400 °C, production of pyrolysis products may be . substantially complete when the temperature approaches 400 °C. Average temperature of the hydrocarbons may be raised at a rate of less than 5 °C per day, less than 2 °C per day, less than 1 °C per day, or less than 0.5 °C per day through the pyrolysis temperature range for producing desired products. Heating the hydrocarbon containing formation with a plurality of heat sources may establish thermal grathents around the heat sources that slowly raise the temperature of hydrocarbons in the formation through the pyrolysis temperature range.<br>
The rate of temperature increase through the pyrolysis temperature range for desired products may affect the quality and quantity of the formation fluids produced from the hydrocarbon containing formation. Raising the temperature slowly through the pyrolysis temperature range for desired products may inhibit mobilization of large chain molecules in the formation. Raising the temperature slowly through the pyrolysis temperature range for desired products may limit reactions between mobilized hydrocarbons that produce undesired products. Slowly raising the temperature of the formation through the pyrolysis temperature range for desired products may allow for the production of high quality, high API gravity hydrocarbons from the formation. Slowly raising the temperature of<br>
 <br>
the formation through the pyrolysis temperature range tor desired products may allow ror me removal or a large amount of the hydrocarbons present in the formation as hydrocarbon product.<br>
In some in situ conversion embodiments, a portion of the formation is heated to a desired temperature instead of slowly heating the temperature through a temperature range. In some embodiments, the desired temperature is 300 °C, 325 °C, or 350 °C. Other temperatures may be selected as the desired temperature. Superposition of heat from heat sources allows the desired temperature to be relatively quickly and efficiently established in the formation. Energy input into the formation from the heat sources may be adjusted to maintain the temperature in the formation substantially at the desired temperature. The heated portion of the formation is maintained substantially at the desired temperature until pyrolysis declines such that production of desired formation fluids from the formation becomes uneconomical. Parts of the formation that are subjected to pyrolysis may include regions brought into a pyrolysis temperature range by heat transfer from only one heat source.<br>
In certain embodiments, formation fluids including pyrolyzation fluids are produced from the formation. As the temperature of the formation increases, the amount of condensable hydrocarbons in the produced formation fluid may decrease. At high temperatures, the formation may produce mostly methane and/or hydrogen. If the hydrocarbon containing formation is heated throughout an entire pyrolysis range, the formation may produce only small amounts of hydrogen towards an upper limit of the pyrolysis range. After all of the available hydrogen is depleted, a minimal amount of fluid production from the formation will typically occur.<br>
After pyrolysis of hydrocarbons, a large amount of carbon and some hydrogen may still be present in the formation. A significant portion of carbon remaining in the formation can be produced from the formation in the form of synthesis gas. Synthesis gas generation may take place during stage 3 heating depicted in FIG. 1. Stage 3 may include heating a hydrocarbon containing formation to a temperature sufficient to allow synthesis gas generation. For example, synthesis gas may be produced in a temperature range from 400 °C to 1200 °C, 500 °C to 1100 °C, or 550 °C to 1000 °C. The temperature of the heated portion of the formation when the synthesis gas generating fluid is introduced to the formation determines the composition of synthesis gas produced in the . formation. The generated synthesis gas may be removed from the formation through a production well or production wells.<br>
Total energy content of fluids produced from the hydrocarbon containing formation may stay relatively constant throughout pyrolysis and synthesis gas generation. During pyrolysis at relatively low formation temperatures, a significant portion of the produced fluid may be condensable hydrocarbons that have a high energy content. At higher pyrolysis temperatures, however, less of the formation fluid may include condensable hydrocarbons. More non-condensable formation fluids may be produced from the formation. Energy content per unit volume of the produced fluid may decline slightly during generation of predominantly non-condensable formation fluids. During synthesis gas generation, energy content per unit volume of produced synthesis gas declines significantly compared to energy content of pyrolyzation fluid. The volume of the produced synthesis gas, however, will in many instances increase substantially, thereby compensating for the decreased energy content.<br>
FIG. 2 depicts a schematic view of an embodiment of a portion of the in situ conversion system for treating the hydrocarbon containing formation. The in situ conversion system may include barrier wells 200. Barrier wells are used to form a barrier around a treatment area. The barrier inhibits fluid flow into and/or out of the treatment area. Barrier wells include, but are not limited to, dewatering wells, vacuum wells, capture wells, injection wells, grout wells, freeze wells, or combinations thereof. In some embodiments, barrier wells 200 are dewatering wells.<br>
 <br>
Dewatering wells may remove liquid water and/or inhibit liquid water from entering a portion of the formation to be heated, or to the formation being heated. In the embodiment depicted in FIG. 2, the barrier wells 200 are shown extending only along one side of heat sources 202, but the barrier wells typically encircle all heat sources 202 used, or to be used, to heat a treatment area of the formation.<br>
Heat sources 202 are placed in at least a portion of the formation. Heat sources 202 may include heaters such as insulated conductors, conductor-in-conduit heaters, surface burners, flameless distributed combustors, and/or natural distributed combustors. Heat sources 202 may also include other types of heaters. Heat sources 202 provide heat to at least a portion of the formation to heat hydrocarbons in the formation. Energy may be supplied to heat sources 202 through supply lines 204. Supply lines 204 may be structurally different depending on the type of heat source or beat sources used to heat the formation. Supply lines 204 for heat sources may transmit electricity for electric heaters, may transport fuel for combustors, or may transport heat exchange fluid that is circulated in the formation.<br>
Production wells 206 are used to remove formation fluid from the formation. In some embodiments, production well 206 may include one or more heat sources. A heat source in the production well may heat one or more portions of the formation at or near the production well. A heat source in a production well may inhibit condensation and reflux of formation fluid being removed from the formation.<br>
Formation fluid produced from production wells 206 may be transported through collection piping 208 to treatment facilities 210. Formation fluids may also be produced from heat sources 202. For example, fluid may be produced from heat sources 202 to control pressure in the formation adjacent to the heat sources. Fluid produced from heat sources 202 may be transported through tubing or piping to collection piping 208 or the produced fluid may be transported through tubing or piping directly to treatment facilities 210. Treatment facilities 210 may include separation units, reaction units, upgrading units, fuel cells, turbines, storage vessels, and/or other systems and units for processing produced formation fluids. The treatment facilities may form transportation fuel from at least a portion of the hydrocarbons produced from the formation.<br>
Temperature limited heaters may be in configurations and/or may include materials that provide automatic temperature limiting properties for the heater at certain temperatures. In certain embodiments, ferromagnetic materials are used in temperature limited heaters. Ferromagnetic material may self-limit temperature at or near the Gurie temperature of the material to provide a reduced amount of heat at or near the Curie temperature when a time-varying current is applied to the material. In certain embodiments, the ferromagnetic material self-limits temperature of the temperature limited heater at a selected temperature that is approximately the Curie temperature. In certain enibodiments, the selected temperature is within 35 °C, within 25 °C, within 20 °C, or within 10 °C of the Curie temperature. In certain embodiments, ferromagnetic materials are coupled with other materials (for example, highly conductive materials, high strength materials, corrosion resistant materials, or combinations thereof) to provide various electrical and/or mechanical properties. Some parts of the temperature limited heater may have a lower resistance (caused by different geometries and/or by using different ferromagnetic and/or non-ferromagnetic materials) than other parts of the temperature limited heater. Having parts of the temperature limited heater with various materials and/or dimensions allows for tailoring the desired heat output from each part of the heater.<br>
Temperature limited heaters may be more reliable than other heaters. Temperature limited heaters may be less apt to break down or fail due to hot spots in the formation. In some embodiments, temperature limited heaters allow for substantially uniform heating of the formation. In some embodiments, temperature limited heaters are able<br>
 <br>
t<br>
to heat the formation more efficiently by operating at a higher average heat output along the entire length of the heater. The temperature limited heater operates at the higher average heat output along the entire length of the heater because power to the heater does not have to be reduced to the entire heater, as is the case with typical constant wattage heaters, if a temperature along any point of the heater exceeds, or is to exceed, a maximum operating temperature of the heater. Heat output from portions of a temperature limited heater approaching a Curie temperature of the heater automatically reduces without controlled adjustment of the time-varying current applied to the heater. The heat output automatically reduces due to changes in electrical properties (for example, electrical resistance) of portions of the temperature limited heater. Thus, more power is supplied by the temperature limited heater during a greater portion of a heating process.<br>
. In certain embodiments, the system including temperature limited heaters initially provides a first heat output and then provides a reduced (second heat output) heat output, near, at, or above the Curie temperature of an electrically resistive portion of the heater when the temperature limited heater is energized by a time-varying current The first heat output is the heat output at temperatures below which the temperature limited heater begins to self-limit In some embodiments, the first heat output is the heat output at a temperature 50 °C, 75 °C, 100 °C, or 125 °C below the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic material in the temperature limited heater.<br>
The temperature limited heater may be energized by time-varying current (alternating current or modulated direct current),supplied at the wellhead. The wellhead may include a power source and other components (for example, modulation components, transformers, and/or capacitors) used in supplying power to the temperature limited heater. The temperature limited heater may be one of many heaters used to heat a portion of the formation.<br>
In certain embodiments, the temperature limited heater includes a conductor that operates as a skin effect or proximity effect heater when time-varying current is applied to the conductor. The skin effect limits the depth of current penetration into the interior of the conductor. For ferromagnetic materials, the skin effect is dominated by the magnetic permeability of the conductor. The relative magnetic permeability of ferromagnetic materials is typically between 10 and 1000 (for example, the relative magnetic permeability of ferromagnetic materials is typically at least 10 and may be at least 50,100,500,1000 or greater). As the temperature of the ferromagnetic material is raised above the Curie temperature and/or as the applied electrical current is increased, the magnetic permeability of the ferromagnetic material decreases substantially and the skin depth expands rapidly (for example, the skin depth expands as the inverse square root of the magnetic permeability). The reduction in magnetic permeability results in a decrease in the AC or modulated DC resistance of the conductor near, at, or above the Curie temperature and/or as the applied electrical current is increased. When the temperature limited heater is powered by a substantially constant current source, portions of the heater that approach, reach, or are above the Curie temperature may have reduced heat dissipation. Sections of the temperature limited heater that are not at or near the Curie temperature may be dominated by skin effect heating that allows the heater to have high heat dissipation due to a higher resistive load.<br>
An advantage of using the temperature limited heater to heat hydrocarbons in the formation is that the conductor is chosen to have a Curie temperature in a desired range of temperature operation. Operation within the desired operating temperature range allows substantial heat injection into the formation while maintaining the temperature of the temperature limited heater, and other equipment, below design limit temperatures. Design limit temperatures are temperatures at which properties such as corrosion, creep, and/or deformation are adversely affected. The temperature limiting properties of the temperature limited heater inhibits overheating or burnout of the<br>
 <br>
heater adjacent to low thermal conductivity "hot spots" in the romation. In some emodiments the temperture limited heater is able to lower or control heat output and/or withstand heat at temperatures above 25 °C, S7 °C, 100 °C, 250 °C, 500 °C, 700 °C, 800 °C, 900 °C, or higher up to 1131 °C, depending on the materials used in the heater.<br>
The temperature limited heater allows for more heat injection into the formation than constant wattage heaters because the energy input into the temperature limited heater does not have to be limited to accommodate low thermal conductivity regions adjacent to the heater. For example, in Green River oil shale there is a difference of at least a factor of 3 in the thermal conductivity of the lowest richness oil shale layers and the highest richness oil shale layers. When heating such a formation, substantially more heat is transferred to the formation with the temperature limited heater than with the conventional heater that is limited by the temperature at low thermal conductivity layers. The heat output along the entire length of the conventional heater needs to accommodate the low thermal conductivity layers so that the heater does not overheat at the low thermal conductivity layers and bum out The heat output adjacent to the low thermal conductivity layers that are at high temperature will reduce for the temperature limited heater, but the remaining portions of the temperature limited heater mat are not at high temperature will still provide high heat output. Because heaters for heating hydrocarbon formations typically have long lengths (for example, at least 10 m, 100 m, 300 m, at least 500 m, 1 km or more up to 10 km), the majority of the length of the temperature limited heater may be operating below the Curie temperature while only a few portions are at or near the Curie temperature of the temperature limited heater.<br>
.   The use of temperature limited heaters allows for efficient transfer of heat to the formation. Efficient transfer of heat allows for reduction in time needed to heat the formation to a desired temperature. For example, in Green River oil shale, pyrolysis typically requires 9.5 years to 10 years of heating when using a 12 m heater well spacing with conventional constant wattage heaters. For the same heater spacing, temperature limited heaters may allow a larger average heat output while maintaining heater equipment temperatures below equipment design limit temperatures. Pyrolysis in the formation may occur at an earlier time with the larger average heat output provided by temperature limited heaters than the lower average heat output provided by constant wattage heaters. For example, in Green River oil shale, pyrolysis may occur in 5 years using temperature limited heaters with a 12 m heater well spacing. Temperature limited heaters counteract hot spots due to inaccurate well spacing or drilling where heater wells come too close together. In certain embodiments, temperature limited heaters allow for increased power output over time for heater wells that have been spaced too far apart, or limit power output for heater wells that are spaced too close together. Temperature limited heaters also supply more power in regions adjacent the overburden and underbidden to compensate for temperature losses in these regions.<br>
Temperature limited heaters may be advantageously used in many types of formations. For example, in tar sands formations or relatively permeable formations containing heavy hydrocarbons, temperature limited heaters may be used to provide a controllable low temperature output for reducing the viscosity of fluids, mobilizing fluids, and/or enhancing the radial flow of fluids at or near the wellbore or in the formation. Temperature limited heaters may be used to inhibit excess coke formation due to overheating of the near wellbore region of the formation.<br>
The use of temperature limited heaters, in some embodiments, eliminates or reduces the need for expensive temperature control circuitry. For example, the use of temperature limited heaters eliminates or reduces the need to perform temperature logging and/or the need to use fixed thermocouples on the heaters to monitor potential overheating at hot spots.<br>
 <br>
In certain embodiments, the temperature limited heater is deformation tolerant Localized movement of material in title wellbore may result in lateral stresses on the heater that could deform its shape. Locations along a length of the heater at which the wellbore approaches or closes on the heater may be hot spots where a standard heater overheats and has the potential to burn out These hot spots may lower the yield strength and creep strength of the metal, allowing crushing or deformation of the heater. The temperature limited heater may be formed with S curves (or other non-linear shapes) that accommodate deformation of the temperature limited heater without causing failure of the heater.<br>
In some embodiments, temperature limited heaters are more economical to manufacture or make than standard heaters. Typical ferromagnetic materials include iron, carbon steel, or ferritic stainless steel. Such materials are inexpensive as compared to nickel-based heating alloys (such as nichrome, Kanthal™ (Bulten-Kanthal AB, Sweden), and/or LOHM™ (Driver-Harris Company, Harrison, New Jersey, U.S.A.)) typically used in insulated conductor (mineral insulated cable) heaters. In one embodiment of the temperature limited heater, the temperature limited heater is manufactured in continuous lengths as an insulated conductor heater to lower costs and improve reliability.<br>
In some embodiments, the temperature limited heater is placed in the heater well using a coiled tubing rig. A heater that can be coiled on a spool may be manufactured by using metal such as ferritic stainless steel (for example, 409 stainless steel) that is welded using electrical resistance welding (ERW). To form a heater section, a metal strip from a roll is passed through a first former where it is shaped into a tubular and then longitudinally   . welded using ERW. The tubular is passed through a second former where a conductive strip (for example, a copper strip) is applied, drawn down tightly on the tubular through a the, and longitudinally welded using ERW. A sheath may be formed by longitudinally welding a support material (for example, steel such as 347H or 347HH) over the conductive strip material. The support material may be a strip rolled .over the conductive strip material. An overburden section of the heater may be formed in a similar manner. In certain embodiments, the overburden section uses a non-ferromagnetic material such as 304 stainless steel or 316 stainless steel instead of a ferromagnetic material. The heater section and overburden section may be coupled together using standard techniques such as butt welding using an orbital welder. In some embodiments, the overburden section material (the non-ferromagnetic material) may be pre-welded to the ferromagnetic material before rolling. The pre-welding may eliminate the need for a separate coupling step (for example, butt welding). In an embodiment, a flexible cable (for example, a furnace cable such as a MGT 1000 furnace cable) may be pulled through the center after forming the tubular beater. An end bushing on the flexible cable may be welded to the tubular heater to provide an electrical current return path. The tubular heater, including the flexible cable, may be coiled onto a spool before installation into a heater well. In an embodiment, the temperature limited heater is installed using the coiled tubing rig. The coiled tubing rig may place the temperature limited heater in a deformation resistant container in the formation. The deformation resistant container may be placed in the heater well using conventional methods.<br>
The ferromagnetic alloy or ferromagnetic alloys used in the temperature limited heater determine the Curie temperature of the heater. Curie temperature data for various metals is listed in "American Institute of Physics Handbook," Second Edition, McGraw-Hill, pages 5-170 through 5-176. Ferromagnetic conductors may include one or more of the ferromagnetic elements (iron, cobalt, and nickel) and/or alloys of these elements. In some embodiments, ferromagnetic conductors include iron-chromium (Fe-Cr) alloys that contain tungsten (W) (for example, HCM12A and SAVE12 (Sumitomo Metals Co., Japan) and/or iron alloys that contain chromium (for<br>
 <br>
example, Fe-Cr alloys, Fe-Cr-W alloys, Fe-Cr-V (vanadium) alloys, Fe-Cr-Nb (Niobium) alloys). Of the three main ferromagnetic elements, iron has a Curie temperature of 770 °C; cobalt (Co) has a Curie temperature of 1131 °C; and nickel has a Curie temperature of approximately 358 °C. An iron-cobalt alloy has a Curie temperature higher than the Curie temperature of iron. For example, iron-cobalt alloy with 2% by weight cobalt has a Curie temperature of 800 °C; iron-cobalt alloy with 12% by weight cobalt has a Curie temperature of 900 °C; and iron-cobalt alloy with 20% by weight cobalt has a Curie temperature of 950 °C. Iron-nickel alloy has a Curie temperature lower than the Curie temperature of iron. For example, iron-nickel alloy with 20% by weight nickel has a Curie temperature of 720 °C, and iron-nickel alloy with 60% by weight nickel has a Curie temperature of 560 °C.<br>
Some non-ferromagnetic elements used as alloys raise the Curie temperature of iron. For example, an iron-vanadium alloy with 5.9% by weight vanadium has a Curie temperature of approximately 815 °C. Other non-ferromagnetic elements (for example, carbon, aluminum, copper, silicon, and/or chromium) may be alloyed with iron or other ferromagnetic materials to lower the Curie temperature. Non-ferromagnetic materials that raise the Curie temperature may be combined with non-ferromagnetic materials that lower the Curie temperature and alloyed with iron or other ferromagnetic materials to produce a material with a desired Curie temperature and other desired physical and/or chemical properties. In some embodiments, the Curie temperature material is a feirite such as NiFe204. In other embodiments, the Curie temperature material is a binary compound such as FeNi3 or Fe3Al.<br>
Certain embodiments of temperature limited heaters may include more than one ferromagnetic material. Such embodiments are within the scope of embodiments described herein if any conditions described herein apply to at least one of the ferromagnetic materials in the temperature limited heater.<br>
Ferromagnetic properties generally decay as the Curie temperature is approached. The "Handbook of Electrical Heating for Industry" by C. James Erickson (IEEE Press, 1995) shows a typical curve for 1% carbon steel (steel with 1% carbon by weight). The loss of magnetic permeability starts at temperatures above 650 °C and tends to be complete when temperatures exceed 730 °C. Thus, the self-limiting temperature may be somewhat below the actual Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor. The skin depth for current flow in 1% carbon steel is 0.132. cm at room temperature and increases to 0.445 cm at 720 °C. From 720 °C to 730 °C, the skin depth sharply increases to over 2.5 cm. Thus, a temperature limited heater embodiment using 1% carbon steel begins to self-limit between 650 °C and 730 °C.<br>
Skin depth generally defines an effective penetration depth of time-varying current into the conductive material. In general, current density decreases exponentially with distance from an outer surface to the center along the radius of the conductor. The depth at which the current density is approximately \Ie of the surface current density is called the skin depth. For a solid cylindrical rod with a diameter much greater than the penetration depth, or for hollow cylinders with a wall thickness exceeding the penetration depth, the skin depth, 5, is:<br>
(1) 8- 198L5* (p/(μ*f))1/2;<br>
in which:	5- skin depth in inches;<br>
p = resistivity at operating temperature (ohm-cm); \i = relative magnetic permeability; and f= frequency (Hz).<br>
EQN. 1 is obtained from 'Handbook of Electrical Heating for Industry" by C. James Erickson (IEEE Press, -1995). For most metals, resistivity (p) increases with temperature. The relative magnetic permeability generally varies with temperature and with current Additional equations may be used to assess the variance of magnetic<br>
 <br>
permeability and/or skin depth on both temperature and/or current The dependence of \i on current arises from the dependence of n on the magnetic field.<br>
Materials used in the temperature limited heater may be selected to provide a desired turndown ratio. Turndown ratios of at least 1.1:1,2:1,3:1,4:1,5:1,10:1,30:1, or 50:1 may be selected for temperature limited heaters. Larger turndown ratios may also be used. A selected turndown ratio may depend on a number of factors including, but not limited to, the type of formation in which the temperature limited heater is located (for example, a higher turndown ratio may be used for an oil shale formation with large variations in thermal conductivity between rich and lean oil shale layers) and/or a temperature limit of materials used in the wellbore (for example, temperature limits of heater materials). In some embodiments, the turndown ratio is increased by coupling additional copper or another good electrical conductor to the ferromagnetic material (for example, adding copper to lower the resistance above the Curie temperature):<br>
The temperature limited heater may provide a minimum heat output (power output) below the Curie temperature of the heater. In certain embodiments, the minimum heat output is at least 400 W/m (Watts per meter), 600 W/m, 700 W/m, 800 W/m, or higher up to 2000 W/m. The temperature limited heater reduces the amount of heat output by a section of the heater when the temperature of the section of the heater approaches or is above the Curie.temperature. The reduced amount of heat may be substantially less than the heat output below the Curie temperature. In some embodiments, the reduced amount of heat is at most 400 W/m, 200 W/m, 100 W/m or may •approach 0 W/m.<br>
In some embodiments, AC frequency is adjusted to change the skin depth of the ferromagnetic material. . For example, the skin depth of 1% carbon steel at room temperature is 0.132 cm at 60 Hz, 0.0762 cm sit 180 Hz, and 0.046 cm at 440 Hz. Since heater diameter is typically larger than twice the. skin depth, using a higher frequency (and feus a heater with a smaller diameter) reduces heater costs. For a fixed geometry, the higher frequency results in a higher turndown ratio. The turndown ratio at a higher frequency is calculated by multiplying the turndown ratio at a lower frequency by the square root of the higher frequency divided by the lower frequency. In some embodiments, a frequency between 100 Hz and 1000 Hz, between 140 Hz and 200 Hz, or between 400 Hz and 600 Hz is used (for example, 180 Hz, 540 Hz, or 720 Hz). In some embodiments, high frequencies maybe used. The frequencies may be greater than 1000 Hz.<br>
In certain embodiments, modulated DC (for example, chopped DC, waveform modulated DC, or cycled • DC) may be used for providing electrical power to the temperature limited heater. A DC modulator or DC chopper may be coupled to a DC power supply to provide an output of modulated direct current In some embodiments, the DC power supply may include means for modulating DC. One example of a DC modulator is a DC-to-DC converter system. DC-to-DC converter systems are generally known in the art DC is typically modulated or chopped into a desired waveform. Waveforms for DC modulation include, but are not limited to, square-wave, sinusoidal, deformed sinusoidal, deformed square-wave, triangular, and other regular or irregular waveforms.<br>
The modulated DC waveform generally defines the frequency of the modulated DC. Thus, the modulated DC waveform may be selected to provide a desired modulated DC frequency. The shape and/or the rate of modulation (such as the rate of chopping) of the modulated DC waveform may be varied to vary the modulated DC frequency. DC may be modulated at frequencies that are higher than generally available AC frequencies. For example, modulated DC may be provided at frequencies of at least 1000 Hz. Increasing the frequency of supplied current to higher values advantageously increases the turndown ratio of the temperature limited heater.<br>
 <br>
In certain embodiments, the modulated DC waveform is adjusted or altered to vary the modulated DC frequency. The DC modulator may be able to adjust or alter the modulated DC waveform at any time during use of the temperature limited heater and at high currents or voltages. Thus, modulated DC provided to the temperature limited heater is not limited to a single frequency or even a small set of frequency values. Waveform selection using the DC modulator typically allows for a wide range of modulated DC frequencies and for discrete control of the modulated DC frequency. Thus, the modulated DC frequency is more easily set at a distinct value whereas AC frequency is generally limited to multiples of the line frequency. Discrete control of the modulated DC frequency allows for more selective control over the turndown ratio of the temperature limited heater. Being able to selectively control the turndown ratio of the temperature limited heater allows for a broader range of materials to be used in designing and constructing the temperature limited heater.<br>
In some embodiments, the modulated DC frequency or the AC frequency is adjusted to compensate for changes in properties (for example, subsurface conditions such as temperature or pressure) of the temperature limited heater during use. The modulated DC frequency or the AC frequency provided to the temperature limited heater is varied based on assessed downhole conditions. For example, as the temperature of the temperature limited heater in the wellbore increases, it may be advantageous to increase fee frequency of the current provided to the heater, thus increasing fee turndown ratio of fee heater. In an embodiment, fee downhole temperature of fee temperature limited heater in fee wellbore is assessed.<br>
In certain embodiments, fee modulated DC frequency, or the AC frequency, is varied to adjust fee turndown ratio of fee temperature limited heater. The turndown ratio may be adjusted to compensate for hot spots occurring along a length of fee temperature limited heater. For example, fee turndown ratio is increased because the temperature limited heater is getting too hot in certain locations. In some embodiments, the modulated DC frequency, or fee AC frequency, are varied to adjust a turndown ratio without assessing a subsurface condition.<br>
In certain embodiments, an outermost layer of fee temperature limited heater (for example, fee outer conductor) is chosen for corrosion resistance, yield strength, and/or creep resistance. In one embodiment, austenitic (non-ferromagnetic) stainless steels such as 201,304H, 347H, 347HH, 316H, 310H, 347HP,.NF709 (Nippon Steel Corp., Japan) stainless steels, or combinations thereof may be used in fee outer conductor. The outermost layer may also include a clad conductor. For example, a corrosion resistant alloy such as 800H or 347H stainless steel may be clad for corrosion protection over a ferromagnetic carbon steel tubular. If high temperature strength is not required, fee outermost layer may be constructed from ferromagnetic metal wife good corrosion resistance such as one of fee ferritic stainless steels. In one embodiment, a ferritic alloy of 82.3% by weight iron wife 17.7% by weight chromium (Curie temperature of 678 °C) provides desired corrosion resistance.<br>
The Metals Handbook, vol. 8, page 291 (American Society of Materials (ASM)) includes a graph of Curie temperature of iron-chromium alloys versus fee amount of chromium in fee alloys. In some temperature limited heater embodiments, a separate support rod or tubular (made from 347H stainless steel) is coupled to fee temperature limited heater made from an iron-chromium alloy to provide yield strength and/or creep resistance. In certain embodiments, fee support material and/or fee ferromagnetic material is selected to provide a 100,000 hour creep-rupture strength of at least 20.7 MPa at 650 °C. In some embodiments, fee 100,000 hour creep-rupture strength is at least 13.8 MPa at 650 °C or at least 6.9 MPa at 650 °C. For example, 347H steel has a favorable creep-rupture strength at or above 650°C. In some embodiments, fee 100,000 hour creep-rupture strength ranges from 6.9 MPa to 41.3 MPa or more for longer heaters and/or higher earth or fluid stresses.<br>
 <br>
In certain embodiments, the temperature limited heater includes a composite conductor with a ferromagnetic tubular and a non-ferromagnetic, high electrical conductivity core. The non-ferromagnetic, high electrical conductivity core reduces a required diameter of the conductor. For example, the conductor may be composite 1.19 cm diameter conductor with a core of 0*575 cm diameter copper clad with a 0.298 cm thickness of ferritic stainless steel or carbon steel surrounding the core. The core or non-ferromagnetic conductor may be copper or copper alloy. The core or non-ferromagnetic conductor may also be made of other metals that exhibit low electrical resistivity and relative magnetic permeabilities near 1 (for example, substantially non-ferromagnetic materials such as aluminum and aluminum alloys, phosphor bronze, beryllium copper, and/or brass). A composite conductor allows the electrical resistance of the temperature limited heater to decrease more steeply near the Curie temperature. As the skin depth increases near the Curie temperature to include the copper core, the electrical resistance decreases very sharply.<br>
The composite conductor may increase the conductivity of the temperature limited heater and/or allow the heater to operate at lower voltages. In an embodiment, the composite conductor exhibits a relatively flat resistance versus temperature profile at temperatures below a region near the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor of the composite conductor. In some embodiments, the temperature limited heater exhibits a relatively flat resistance versus temperature profile between 100 °C and 750 °C or between 300 °C and 600 °C. The relatively flat resistance versus temperature profile may also be exhibited in other temperature ranges by adjusting, for example, materials and/or the configuration of materials in the temperature limited heater. In certain embodiments, the relative thickness of each material in the composite conductor is selected to produce a desired resistivity versus temperature profile for the temperature limited heater.<br>
A composite conductor (for example, a composite inner conductor or a composite outer conductor) may be manufactured by methods including, but not limited to, coextrusion, roll forming, tight fit tubing (for example, cooling the inner member and heating the outer member, then inserting the inner member in the outer member, followed by a drawing operation and/or allowing the system to cool), explosive or electromagnetic cladding, arc overlay welding, longitudinal strip welding, plasma powder welding, billet coextrusion, electroplating, drawing, sputtering, plasma deposition, coextrusion casting, magnetic forming, molten cylinder casting (of inner core material inside the outer or vice versa), insertion followed by welding or high temperature braising, shielded active gas welding (SAG), and/or insertion of an inner pipe in an outer pipe followed by mechanical expansion of the inner pipe by hydroforming or use of a pig to expand and swage the inner pipe against the outer pipe. In some embodiments, a ferromagnetic conductor is braided over a non-ferromagnetic conductor. In certain embodiments, composite conductors are formed using methods similar to those used for cladding (for example, cladding copper to steel). A metallurgical bond between copper cladding and base ferromagnetic material may be advantageous. Composite conductors produced by a coextrusion process mat forms a good metallurgical bond (for example, a good bond between copper and 446 stainless steel) may be provided by Anomet Products, Inc. (Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, U.S.A.).<br>
FIGS. 3-9 depict various embodiments of temperature limited heaters. One or more features of an embodiment of the temperature limited heater depicted in any of these figures may be combined with one or more features of other embodiments of temperature limited heaters depicted in these figures. In certain embodiments described herein, temperature limited heaters are dimensioned to operate at a frequency of 60 Hz AC. It is to be understood that dimensions of the temperature limited heater may be adjusted from those described herein in order<br>

for the temperature limited heater to operate in a similar manner at other AC frequencies or with modulated DC current.<br>
FIG. 3 depicts a cross-sectional representation of an embodiment of the temperature limited heater with an outer conductor having a ferromagnetic section and a non-ferromagnetic section. FIGS. 4 and 5 depict transverse cross-sectional views of the embodiment shown in FIG. 3. In one embodiment, ferromagnetic section 212 is used to provide heat to hydrocarbon layers in the formation. Non-ferromagnetic section 214 is used in the overburden of the formation. Non-ferromagnetic section 214 provides little or no heat to the overburden, thus inhibiting heat losses in the overburden and improving heater efficiency. Ferromagnetic section 212 includes a ferromagnetic material such as 409 stainless steel or 410 stainless steel. Ferromagnetic section 212 has a thickness of 0.3 cm. Non-ferromagnetic section 214 is copper with a thickness of 0.3 cm. Inner conductor 216 is copper. Inner conductor 216 has a diameter of 0.9 cm. Electrical insulator 218 is silicon nitride, boron nitride, magnesium oxide powder, or another suitable insulator material. Electrical insulator 218 has a thickness of 0.1 cm to 0.3 cm.<br>
FIG. 6A and FIG. 6B depict cross-sectional representations of an embodiment of a temperature limited heater with a ferromagnetic inner conductor and a non-ferromagnetic core. Inner conductor 216 may be made of 446 stainless steel, 409 stainless steel, 410 stainless steel, carbon steel, Armco ingot iron, iron-cobalt alloys, or other ferromagnetic materials. Core 220 may be tightly bonded inside inner conductor 216. Core 220 is copper or other non-ferromagnetic material. In certain embodiments, core 220 is inserted as a tight fit inside inner conductor 216 before a drawing operation. In some embodiments, core 220 and inner conductor 216 axe coextrusion bonded. Outer conductor 222 is 347H stainless steel. A drawing or rolling operation to compact electrical insulator 218 (for example, compacted silicon nitride, boron nitride, or magnesium oxide powder) may ensure good electrical contact between inner conductor 216 and core 220. In this embodiment, heat is produced primarily in inner conductor 216 until the Curie temperature is approached. Resistance then decreases sharply as current penetrates core 220.<br>
For a temperature limited heater in which the ferromagnetic conductor provides a majority of the resistive heat output below the Curie temperature, a majority of the current flows through material with highly non-linear functions of magnetic field (H) versus magnetic induction (B). These non-linear functions may cause strong inductive effects and distortion that lead to decreased power factor in the temperature limited heater at temperatures , below the Curie temperature. These effects may render the electrical power supply to the temperature limited heater difficult to control and may result in additional current flow through surface and/or overburden power supply conductors. Expensive and/or difficult to implement control systems such as variable capacitors or modulated power supplies may be used to attempt to compensate for these effects and to control temperature limited heaters where the majority of the resistive heat output is provided by current flow through the ferromagnetic material<br>
In certain temperature limited heater embodiments, the ferromagnetic conductor confines a majority of the flow of electrical current to an electrical conductor coupled to the ferromagnetic conductor when the temperature limited heater is below or near the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor. The electrical conductor may be a sheath, jacket, support member, corrosion resistant member, or other electrically resistive member. In some embodiments, the ferromagnetic conductor confines a majority of the flow of electrical current to the electrical conductor positioned between an outermost layer and the ferromagnetic conductor. The ferromagnetic conductor is located in the cross section of the temperature limited heater such that the magnetic properties of the ferromagnetic conductor at or below the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor confine the majority of the flow of electrical current to the electrical conductor. The majority of the flow of electrical current is confined to the<br>
 <br>
electrical conductor due to the skin effect of the ferromagnetic conductor. Thus, the majority of the current is flowing through material with substantially linear resistive properties throughout most of the operating range of the heater.<br>
In certain embodiments, the ferromagnetic conductor and the electrical conductor are located in the cross, section of the temperature limited heater so that the skin effect of the ferromagnetic material limits the penetration depth of electrical current in the electrical conductor and the ferromagnetic conductor at temperatures below the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor. Thus, the electrical conductor provides a majority of the electrically resistive heat output of the temperature limited heater at temperatures up to a temperature at or near the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor. In certain embodiments, the dimensions of the electrical conductor may be chosen to provide desired heat output characteristics.<br>
Because the majority of the current flows through the electrical conductor below the Curie temperature, the temperature limited heater has a resistance versus temperature profile that at least partially reflects the resistance versus temperature profile of the material in the electrical conductor. Thus, the resistance versus temperature profile of the temperature limited heater is substantially linear below the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor if the material in the electrical conductor has a substantially linear resistance versus temperature profile. The resistance of the temperature limited heater has little or no dependence on the current flowing through the heater until fee temperature nears the Curie temperature. The majority of the current flows in the electrical conductor rather than the ferromagnetic conductor below the Curie temperature.<br>
Resistance versus temperature profiles for temperature limited heaters in which the majority of the current flows in the electrical conductor also tend to exhibit sharper reductions in resistance near or at the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor. The sharper reductions in resistance near or at the Curie temperature are easier to control than more gradual resistance reductions near the Curie temperature.<br>
. hi certain embodiments, the material and/or the dimensions of the material in the electrical conductor aire selected so that the temperature limited heater has a desired resistance versus temperature profile below fee Curie temperature of fee ferromagnetic conductor.<br>
Temperature limited heaters in which fee majority of fee current flows in fee electrical conductor rather than fee ferromagnetic conductor below the Curie temperature are easier to predict and/or control. Behavior of temperature limited heaters in which fee majority of fee current flows in the electrical conductor rather than fee ferromagnetic conductor below the Curie temperature may be predicted by, for example, its resistance versus temperature-profile and/or its power factor versus temperature profile. Resistance versus temperature profiles and/or power factor versus temperature profiles may be assessed or predicted by, for example, experimental measurements feat assess fee behavior of fee temperature limited heater, analytical equations that assess or predict fee behavior of fee temperature limited heater, and/or simulations that assess or predict fee behavior of fee temperature limited heater.<br>
As fee temperature of fee temperature limited heater approaches or exceeds the Curie temperature of fee ferromagnetic conductor, reduction in fee ferromagnetic properties of fee ferromagnetic conductor allows electrical current to flow through a greater portion of fee electrically conducting cross section of the temperature limited heater. Thus, fee electrical resistance of fee temperature limited heater is reduced and fee temperature limited heater automatically provides reduced heat output at or near fee Curie temperature of fee ferromagnetic conductor. In certain embodiments, a highly electrically conductive member is coupled to fee ferromagnetic conductor and fee<br>
 <br>
electrical conductor to reduce the electrical resistance of the temperature limited heater at or above the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor. The highly electrically conductive member may be an inner conductor, a core, or another conductive member of copper, aluminum, nickel, or alloys thereof.<br>
The ferromagnetic conductor that confines the majority of the flow of electrical current to the electrical conductor at temperatures below the Curie temperature may have a relatively small cross section compared to the ferromagnetic conductor in temperature limited heaters that use the ferromagnetic conductor to provide the majority of resistive heat output up to or near the Curie temperature. A temperature limited heater that uses the electrical conductor to provide a majority of the resistive heat output below the Curie temperature has low magnetic inductance at temperatures below the Curie temperature because less current is flowing through the ferromagnetic conductor as compared to the temperature limited heater where the majority of the resistive heat output below the Curie temperature is provided by the ferromagnetic material. Magnetic field (H) at radius (r) of the ferromagnetic conductor is proportional to the current (I) flowing through the ferromagnetic conductor and the core divided by the radius, or:   •<br>
(2)	H oc I/r.<br>
Since only a portion of the current flows through the ferromagnetic conductor for a temperature limited heater that uses the outer conductor to provide a majority of the resistive heat output below the Curie temperature, the magnetic field of the temperature limited heater may be significantly smaller than the magnetic field of the temperature limited heater where the majority of the current flows through the ferromagnetic material. The relative magnetic permeability (\i) may be large for small magnetic fields.<br>
The skin depth (8) of the ferromagnetic conductor is inversely proportional to the square root of the relative magnetic permeability (p):<br>
(3)	8 oc (1/ji)*.<br>
Increasing the relative magnetic permeability decreases the skin depth of the ferromagnetic conductor. However, because only a portion of the current flows through the ferromagnetic conductor for temperatures below the Curie temperature, the radius (or thickness) of the ferromagnetic conductor may be decreased for ferromagnetic materials with large relative magnetic permeabilities to compensate for the decreased skin depth while still allowing the skin effect to limit the penetration depth of the electrical current to the electrical conductor at temperatures below the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor. The radius (thickness) of the ferromagnetic conductor maybe between 0.3 mm and 8 mm, between 0.3 mm and 2 mm, or between 2 mm and 4 mm depending on the relative magnetic permeability of the ferromagnetic conductor. Decreasing the thickness of the ferromagnetic conductor decreases costs of manufacturing the temperature limited heater, as the cost of ferromagnetic material tends to be a significant portion of the cost of the temperature limited heater. Increasing the relative magnetic permeability of the ferromagnetic conductor provides a higher turndown ratio and a sharper decrease in electrical resistance for the temperature limited heater at or near the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor.<br>
Ferromagnetic materials (such as purified iron or iron-cobalt alloys) with high relative magnetic permeabilities (for example, at least 200, at least 1000, at least 1 x 104, or at least 1 x 105) and/or high Curie temperatures (for example, at least 600 °C, at least 700 °C, or at least 800 °C) tend to have less corrosion resistance and/or less mechanical strength at high temperatures. The electrical conductor may provide corrosion resistance and/or high mechanical strength at high temperatures for the temperature limited heater. Thus, the ferromagnetic conductor may be chosen primarily for its ferromagnetic properties.<br>
 <br>
Confining the majority of the flow of electrical current to the electrical conductor below the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor reduces variations in the power factor. Because only a portion of the electrical current flows through the ferromagnetic conductor below the Curie temperature, the non-linear ferromagnetic properties of the ferromagnetic conductor have little or no effect on the power factor of the temperature limited heater, except at or near the Curie temperature. Even at or near the Curie temperature, the effect on the power factor is reduced compared to temperature limited heaters in which the ferromagnetic conductor provides a majority of the resistive heat output below the Curie temperature. Thus, there is less or no need for external compensation (for example, variable capacitors or waveform modification) to adjust for changes in the inductive load of the temperature limited heater to maintain a relatively high power factor.<br>
In certain embodiments, the temperature limited heater, which confines the majority of the flow of electrical current to the electrical conductor below the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor, maintains the power factor above 0.85, above 0.9, or above 0.9S during use of the heater. Any reduction in the power factor occurs only in sections of the temperature limited heater at temperatures near the Curie temperature. Most sections of the temperature limited heater are typically not at or near the Curie temperature during use. These sections have a high power factor that approaches 1.0. The power factor for the entire temperature limited heater is maintained above 0.85, above 0.9, or above 0.95 during use of the heater even if some sections of the heater have power factors below 0.85.<br>
Maintaining high power factors also allows for less expensive power supplies and/or control devices such as solid state power supplies or SCRs (silicon controlled rectifiers). These devices may fail to operate properly if the power factor varies by too large an amount because of inductive loads. With the power factors maintained at the higher values; however, these devices may be used to provide power to the temperature limited heater. Solid state power supplies also have the advantage of allowing fine tuning and controlled adjustment of the power supplied to the temperature limited heater.<br>
In some embodiments, transformers are used to provide power to the temperature limited heater. Multiple voltage taps may be made into the transformer to provide power to the temperature limited heater. Multiple voltage taps allows the current supplied to switchback and forth between the multiple voltages. Ibis maintains the current within a range bound by the multiple voltage taps.<br>
The highly electrically conductive member, or inner conductor, increases the turndown ratio of the temperature limited heater. In certain embodiments, thickness of the highly electrically conductive member is increased to increase the turndown ratio of the temperature limited heater. In some embodiments, the thickness of the electrical conductor is reduced to increase the turndown ratio of the temperature limited heater. In certain embodiments, the turndown ratio of the temperature limited heater is between 1.1 and 10, between 2 and 8, or between 3 and 6 (for example, the turndown ratio is at least LI, at least 2, or at least 3).<br>
FIG. 7 depicts an embodiment of a temperature limited heater in which the support member provides a majority of the heat output below the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor. Core 220 is an inner conductor of the temperature limited heater. In certain embodiments, core 220 is a highly electrically conductive material such as copper or aluminum. In some embodiments, core 220 is a copper alloy that provides mechanical strength and good electrically conductivity such as a dispersion strengthened copper. In one embodiment, core 220 is Glidcop® (SCM Metal Products, Inc., Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, U.S.A.). Ferromagnetic conductor 224 is a thin layer of ferromagnetic material between electrical conductor 226 and core 220. In certain<br>
 <br>
embodiments, electrical conductor 226 is also support member 228. In certain embodiments, ferromagnetic conductor 224 is iron or an iron alloy. In some embodiments, ferromagnetic conductor 224 includes ferromagnetic material with a high relative magnetic permeability. For example, ferromagnetic conductor 224 may be purified iron such as Armco ingot iron (AK Steel Ltd., United Kingdom). Iron with some impurities typically has a relative magnetic permeability on the order of 400. Purifying the iron by annealing the iron in hydrogen gas (Efe) at 1450 °C increases the relative magnetic permeability of the iron. Increasing the relative magnetic permeability of ferromagnetic conductor 224 allows the thickness of the ferromagnetic conductor to be reduced. For example, the thickness of unpurified iron may be approximately AS mm while the thickness of the purified iron is approximately 0.76 mm.<br>
In certain embodiments, electrical conductor 226 provides support for ferromagnetic conductor 224 and the temperature limited heater. Electrical conductor 226 may be made of a material that provides good mechanical strength at temperatures near or above the Curie temperature of ferromagnetic conductor 224. In certain embodiments, electrical conductor 226 is a corrosion resistant member. Electrical conductor 226 (support member 228) may provide support for ferromagnetic conductor 224 and corrosion resistance. Electrical conductor 226 is madefrom a material that provides desired electrically resistive heat output at temperatures up to and/or above the Curie temperature of ferromagnetic conductor 224.<br>
In an embodiment, electrical conductor 226 is 347H stainless steel. In some embodiments, electrical conductor 226 is another electrically conductive, good mechanical strength, corrosion resistant material. For example, electrical conductor 226 may be 304H, 316H, 347HH, NF709, Incoloy® 800H alloy (Inco Alloys International, Huntington, West Virginia, U.S.A.), Haynes® HR120® alloy, or Inconel® 617 alloy. .<br>
In some embodiments, electrical conductor 226 (support member 228) includes different alloys in different portions of the temperature limited heater. For example, a lower portion ofelectrical conductor 226 (support member 228) is 347H stainless steel and an upper portion of the electrical conductor (support member) is NF709. In certain embodiments, different alloys are used in different portions of the electrical conductor (support member) to increase the mechanical strength of the electrical conductor (support member) while maintaining desired heating properties for the temperature limited heater.<br>
In some embodiments, ferromagnetic conductor 224 includes different ferromagnetic conductors in different portions of the temperature limited heater. Different ferromagnetic conductors may be used in different portions of the temperature limited heater to vary the Curie temperature and, thus, the maximum operating temperature in the different portions. In some embodiments, the Curie temperature in an upper portion of the temperature limited heater is lower than the Curie temperature in a lower portion of the heater. The lower Curie temperature in the upper portion increases the creep-rupture strength lifetime in the upper portion of the heater.<br>
In the embodiment depicted in FIG. 7, ferromagnetic conductor 224, electrical conductor 226, and core 220 are dimensioned so that the skin depth of the ferromagnetic conductor limits the penetration depth of the majority of the flow of electrical current to the support member when the temperature is below the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor. Thus, electrical conductor 226 provides a majority of the electrically resistive heat output of the temperature limited heater at temperatures up to a temperature at or near the.Curie temperature of ferromagnetic conductor 224. In certain embodiments, the temperature limited heater depicted in FIG. 7 is smaller (for example, an outside diameter of 3 cm, 2.9 cm, 2.5 cm, or less) than other temperature limited heaters that do not use electrical conductor 226 to provide the majority of electrically resistive heat output The temperature limited<br>
 <br>
heater depicted in FIG. 7 may be smaller because ferromagnetic conductor 224 is thin as compared to the size of the ferromagnetic conductor needed for a temperature limited heater in which the majority of the resistive heat output is provided by the ferromagnetic conductor.<br>
In some embodiments, the support member and the corrosion resistant member are different members in the temperature limited heater. FIGS. 8 and 9 depict embodiments of temperature limited heaters in which the jacket provides a majority of the heat output below the Curie temperature of the ferromagnetic conductor. In these embodiments, electrical conductor 226 is jacket 230. Electrical conductor 226, ferromagnetic conductor 224, support member 228, and core 220 (in FIG. 8) or inner conductor 216 (in FIG. 9) are dimensioned so that the skin depth of the ferromagnetic conductor limits the penetration depth of the majority of the flow of electrical current to the thickness of the jacket In certain embodiments, electrical conductor 226 is a material that is corrosion resistant and provides electrically resistive heat output below the Curie temperature of ferromagnetic conductor 224. For example, electrical conductor 226 is 825 stainless steel or 347H stainless steel. In some embodiments, electrical conductor 226 has a small thickness (for example, on the order of 0.5 mm).<br>
In FIG. 8, core 220 is highly electrically conductive material such as copper or aluminum. Support member 228 is 347H stainless steel or another material with good mechanical strength at or near the Curie temperature of ferromagnetic conductor 224.<br>
In FIG. 9, support member 228 is the core of the temperature limited heater and is 347H stainless steel or another material with good mechanical strength at or near the Curie temperature of ferromagnetic conductor 224. Inner conductor 216 is highly electrically conductive material such as copper or aluminum.<br>
The temperature limited heater may be a single-phase heater or a three-phase heater. In a three-phase heater embodiment, the temperature limited heater has a delta or a wye configuration. In some embodiments, the three-phase heater includes three legs that are located in separate wellbores. The legs may be coupled in a common<br>
i contacting section (for example, a central wellbore, a connecting wellbore, or a solution filled contacting section).<br>
FIG. 10 depicts an embodiment of temperature limited heaters coupled together in a three-phase configuration. Each leg 232,234,236 may be located in separate openings 238 in hydrocarbon layer 240. Each leg 232, 234,236 may include heating element 242. Each leg 232,234,236 may be coupled to single contacting element 244 in one opening 238. Contacting element 244 may electrically couple legs 232,234, 236 together in a three-phase configuration. Contacting element 244 may be located in, for example, a central opening in the formation. Contacting element 244 may be located in a portion of opening 238 below hydrocarbon layer 240 (for example, in the underburden). In certain embodiments, magnetic tracking of a magnetic element located in a central opening (for example, opening 238 with leg 234) is used to guide the formation of the outer openings (for example, openings 238 with legs 232 and 236) so that the outer openings intersect the central opening. The central opening may be formed first using standard wellbore drilling methods. Contacting element 244 may include funnels, guides, or catchers for allowing each leg to be inserted into the contacting element.<br>
In certain embodiments, portions of legs 232 and 234 in overburden 246 have insulation (for example, polymer insulation) to inhibit heating the overburden. Heating elements 242 may be substantially vertical and substantially parallel to each other in hydrocarbon layer 240. At or near the bottom of hydrocarbon layer 240, leg 232 may be directionally drilled towards leg 234 to intercept leg 234 in a contacting section. Directional drilling may be done by, for example, Vector Magnetics LLC (Ithaca, New York, U.S. A.). The depth of the contacting section depends on the length of bend in leg 232 needed to intercept leg 234. For example, for a 40 ft (12 m) spacing<br>
 <br>
between vertical portions of legs 232 and 234,200 ft (61 m) is needed to allow the bend of leg 232 to intercept leg 234.<br>
FIG. 11 depicts an embodiment of three heaters coupled in a three-phase configuration. Conductor "legs" 232,234,236 are coupled to three-phase transformer 250. Transformer 250 may be an isolated three-phase transformer. In certain embodiments, transformer 250 provides three-phase output in a wye configuration, as shown in FIG. 11. Input to transformer 250 may be made in any input configuration (such as the delta configuration shown in FIG. 11). Legs 232,234, 236 each include lead-in conductors 252 in the overburden of the formation coupled to heating elements 242 in hydrocarbon layer 240. Lead-in conductors 252 include copper with an insulation layer. For example, lead-in conductors 252 may be a 4-0 copper cables with TEFLON® insulation, a copper rod with polyurethane insulation, or other metal conductors such as bare copper or aluminum. In certain embodiments, lead-in conductors 252 are located in an overburden portion of the formation. The overburden portion may include overburden casings 262. Heating elements 242 may be temperature limited heater heating elements. In an embodiment, heating elements 242 are 410 stainless steel rods (for example, 3.1 cm diameter 410 stainless steel rods). In some embodiments, heating elements 242 are composite temperature limited heater heating elements (for example, 347 stainless steel, 410 stainless steel, copper composite heating elements; 347 stainless steel, iron, copper composite heating elements; or 410 stainless steel and copper composite heating elements). In certain embodiments, heating elements 242 have a length of at least 10 m to 2000 m, 20 m to 400 m, or 30 m to 300 m.<br>
In certain embodiments, heating elements 242 are exposed to hydrocarbon layer 240 and fluids from the hydrocarbon layer. Thus, heating elements 242 are "bare metal" or "exposed metal" heating elements. Heating elements 242 may be made from a material that has an acceptable sulfidation rate at high temperatures used for pyrolyzing hydrocarbons. In certain embodiments, heating elements 242 are made from material that has a sulfidation rate that decreases with increasing temperature over at least a certain temperature range (for example, 530 °C to 650 °C), such as 410 stainless steel. Using such materials reduces corrosion problems due to sulfur-containing gases (such as H2S) from the formation. Heating elements 242 may also be substantially inert to galvanic corrosion.   ,<br>
In some embodiments, heating elements 242 have a thin electrically insulating layer such as aluminum oxide or thermal spray coated aluminum oxide. In some embodiments, the thin electrically insulating layer is an enamel coating of a ceramic composition. These enamel coatings include, but are not limited to, high temperature porcelain enamels. High temperature porcelain enamels may include silicon dioxide, boron oxide, alumina, and alkaline earth oxides (CaO or MgO), and minor amounts of alkali oxides (Na20, K20, LiO). The enamel coating may be applied as a finely ground slurry by dipping the heating element into the slurry or spray coating the heating element with the slurry. The coated heating element is then heated in a furnace until the glass transition temperature is reached so that the slurry spreads over the surface of the heating element and makes the porcelain enamel coating. The porcelain enamel coating contracts when cooled below the glass transition temperature so that the coating is in compression. Thus, when the coating is heated during operation of the heater the coating is able to expand with the heater without cracking.<br>
The thin electrically insulating layer has low thermal impedance allowing heat transfer from the heating element to the forznation while inhibiting current leakage between heating elements in adjacent openings and current leakage into the formation. In certain embodiments, the thin electrically insulating layer is stable at temperatures above at least 350 °C, above 500 °C, or above 800 °C. In certain embodiments, the thin electrically insulating layer<br>
 <br>
has an emissivity of at least 0.7, at least 0.8, or at least 0.9. Using the thin electrically insulating layer may allow for long heater lengths in the formation with low current leakage.<br>
Heating elements 242 may be coupled to contacting elements 244 at or near the underbidden of the formation. Contacting elements 244 are copper or aluminum rods or other highly conductive materials. In certain embodiments, transition sections 254 are located between lead-in conductors 252 and heating elements 242, and/or between heating elements 242 and contacting elements 244. Transition sections 254 may be made of a conductive material that is corrosion resistant such as 347 stainless steel over a copper core. In certain embodiments, transition sections 254 are made of materials that electrically couple lead-in conductors 252 and heating elements 242 while providing little or no heat output Thus, transition sections 254 help to inhibit overheating of conductors and insulation used in lead-in conductors 252 by spacing the lead-in conductors from heating elements 242. Transition section 254 may have a length of between 3 m and 9 m (for example, 6 m).<br>
Contacting elements 244 are coupled to contactor 256 in contacting section 260 to electrically couple legs 232,234,236 to each other. In some embodiments, contact solution 258 (for example, conductive cement) is placed in contacting section 260 to electrically couple contacting elements 244 in the contacting section. In certain embodiments, legs 232,234,236 are substantially parallel in hydrocarbon layer 240 and leg 232 continues substantially vertically into contacting section 260. The other two legs 234; 236 are directed (for example, by dixectionally drilling the wellbores for the legs) to intercept leg 232 in contacting section 260,<br>
Each leg 232,234,236 may be one leg of a three-phase heater embodiment so that the legs are substantially electrically isolated firom other heaters in the formation and are substantially electrically isolated from the formation. Legs 232, 234, 236 may be arranged in a triangular pattern so that the three legs form a triangular shaped three-phase heater. In an embodiment, legs 232,234, 236 are arranged in a triangular pattern with 12 m spacing between the legs (each side of the triangle has a length of 12 m).<br>
In certain embodiments, the thin electrically insulating layer allows for relatively long, substantially horizontal heater leg lengths in the hydrocarbon layer with a substantially u-shaped heater. Substantially u-shaped wellbores may be used in tar sands formations, oil shale formation, or other formations with relatively thin hydrocarbon layers. Tar sands or thin oil shale formations may have thin shallow layers that are more easily and -   uniformly heated using heaters placed in substantially u-shaped wellbores. Substantially u-shaped wellbores. may also be used to process formations with thick hydrocarbon layers in formations. In some embodiments, substantially u-shaped wellbores are used to access rich layers in a thick hydrocarbon formation.<br>
FIG. 12 depicts a side view representation of an embodiment of a substantially u-shaped three-phase heater. First ends of legs 232, 234,236 are coupled to transformer 250 at first location 264. In an embodiment, transformer 250 is a three-phase AC transformer. Ends of legs 232,234,236 are electrically coupled together with connector 266 at second location 268. Connector 266 electrically couples the ends of legs 232,234,236 so that the legs can be operated in a three-phase configuration. In certain embodiments, legs 232,234,236 are coupled to operate in a three-phase wye configuration. In certain embodiments, legs 232,234, 236 are substantially parallel in hydrocarbon layer 240. In certain embodiments, legs 232,234,236 are arranged in a triangular pattern in hydrocarbon layer 240. In certain embodiments, heating elements 242 include a thin electrically insulating material (such as a porcelain enamel coating) to inhibit current leakage from the heating elements. In certain embodiments, legs 232,234,236 are electrically coupled so that the legs are substantially electrically isolated from other heaters in the formation and are substantially electrically isolated from the formation.<br>
 <br>
In certain embodiments, overburden casings (for example, overouraen casings zoz, aepicrea in riuo. 11 and 12) in overburden 246 include materials that inhibit ferromagnetic effects in the casings. Inhibiting ferromagnetic effects in casings 262 reduces heat losses to the overburden. In some embodiments, casings 262 may include non-metallic materials such as fiberglass, polyvinylchloride (PVC), chlorinated polyvinylchloride (CPVC), or high-density polyethylene (HDPE). HDPEs that may be operable at temperatures in overburden 246 include HDPEs available from Dow Chemical Co., Inc. (Midland, Michigan, USA). A non-metallic casing may also eliminate the need for an insulated overburden conductor. In some embodiments, casings 262 include carbon steel coupled on the inside diameter of a non-ferromagnetic metal (for example, carbon steel clad with copper or aluminum) to inhibit ferromagnetic effects or inductive effects in the carbon steel. Other non-ferromagnetic metals include, but are not limited to, manganese steels with at least 10% by weight manganese, iron aluminum alloys with at least 18% by weight aluminum, and austentitic stainless steels such as 304 stainless steel or 316 stainless steel.<br>
In certain embodiments, one or more non-ferromagnetic materials used in casings 262 are used in a wellhead coupled to the casings and legs 232,234,236. Using non-ferromagnetic materials in the wellhead inhibits undesirable heating of components in the wellhead. In some embodiments, an inert gas (for example, nitrogen or argon) is purged inside the wellhead and/or inside of casings 262 to inhibit reflux of heated gases into the wellhead and/or the casings.<br>
In certain embodiments, one or more of legs 232,234,236 are installed in the formation using coiled tubing. In certain embodiments, coiled tubing is installed in the formation, the leg is installed inside the coiled tubing, and the coiled tubing is pulled out of the formation to leave the leg installed in the formation. The leg may be placed concentrically inside the coiled tubing. In some embodiments, coiled tubing with the leg inside the coiled tubing is installed in the formation and the coiled tubing is removed from the formation to leave the leg installed in the formation. The coiled tubing may extend only to a junction of hydrocarbon layer 240 and contacting section 260 or to a point at which the leg begins to bend in the contacting section.<br>
FIG. 13 depicts a top view representation of an embodiment of a plurality of triads of three-phase heaters in the formation. Each triad 270 includes legs A, B, C (which may correspond to legs 232,234,236 depicted in FIGS. 11 and 12) that are electrically coupled by linkage 274. Each triad 270 is coupled to its own electrically isolated three-phase transformer so that the triads are substantially electrically isolated from each other. Electrically isolating the triads inhibits net current flow between triads.<br>
The phases of each triad 270 may be arranged so that legs A, B, C correspond between triads as shown in FIG. 13. In FIG. 13, legs A, B, C are arranged such that a phase leg (for example, leg A) in a given triad is two triad heights from a same phase leg (leg A) in an adjacent triad. The triad height is the distance from a vertex of the triad to a midpoint of the line intersecting the other two vertices of the triad. In certain embodiments, the phases of triads 270 are arranged to inhibit net current flow between individual triads. There may be some leakage of current within an individual triad but little net current flows between two triads due to the substantial electrical isolation of the triads and, in certain embodiments, the arrangement of the triad phases.<br>
In the early stages of heating, an exposed heating element (for example, heating element 242 depicted in FIGS. 11 and 12) may leak some current to water or other fluids that are electrically conductive in the fonnation so that the formation itself is heated. After water or other electrically conductive fluids are removed from the wellbore (for example, vaporized or produced), the heating elements become electrically isolated from the formation. Later, when water is removed from the formation, the formation becomes even more electrically resistant and heating of<br>
 <br>
the Formation occurs even more predominantly via thermally conductive and/or radiative heating. Typically, the formation (the hydrocarbon layer) has an initial electrical resistance feat averages at least 10 ohmm In some embodiments, the formation has an initial electrical resistance of at least 100 ohm*m or of at least 300 ohnrm.<br>
Using the temperature limited heaters as the heating elements limits the effect of water saturation on heater efficiency. With water in the formation and in heater wellbores, there is a tendency for electrical current to flow between heater elements at the top of the hydrocarbon layer where the voltage is highest and cause uneven heating in the hydrocarbon layer. This effect is inhibited with temperature limited heaters because the temperature limited heaters reduce localized overheating in the heating elements and in the hydrocarbon layer.<br>
In certain embodiments, production wells are placed at a location at which there is relatively little or zero voltage potential. This location minimizes stray potentials at the production well. Placing production wells at such locations reduces or inhibits undesired heating of the production wells caused by electrical current flow in the production wells. FIG. 14 depicts a top view representation of the embodiment depicted in FIG. 13 with production wells 206. In certain embodiments, production wells 206 are located at or near center of triad 270. In certain embodiments, production wells 206 are placed at a location between triads at which there is relatively little or zero 
'FIG. IS depicts a top view representation of an embodiment of a plurality of triads of three-phase heaters in a hexagonal pattern in the formation. FIG. 16 depicts a top view representation of an embodiment of a hexagon from FIG. 15. Hexagon 276 includes two triads of heaters. The first triad includes legs Al, Bl, CI electrically coupled together by linkages 274 in a three-phase configuration. The second triad includes legs A2, B2, C2 electrically coupled together by linkages 274 in a three-phase configuration- The triads are arranged so that corresponding legs of the triads (for example, Al and A2, Bl and B2, CI and C2) are at opposite vertices of hexagon 276. The triads are electrically coupled and arranged so that there is relatively little or zero voltage potential at or near the center of hexagon 276.<br>
Production well 206 may be placed at or near the center of hexagon 276. Placing production well 206 at or near the center of hexagon 276 places the production well at a location that reduces or inhibits undesired heating due to electromagnetic effects caused by electrical current flow in the legs of the triads. Having two triads in hexagon 276 provides for redundant heating around production well 206, Thus, if one triad fails or has to be turned off, production well 206 still remains at a center of one triad.<br>
As shown in FIG. 15, hexagons 276 may be arranged in a pattern in the formation such that adjacent hexagons are offset Using electrically isolated transformers on adjacent hexagons may inhibit electrical potentials in the formation so that little or no net current leaks between hexagons.<br>
Triads of heaters and/or heater legs may be arranged in any shape or desired pattern. For example, as described above, triads may include three heaters and/or heater legs arranged in a equilateral triangular pattern. In some embodiments, triads include three heaters and/or heater legs arranged in other triangular shapes (for example, an isosceles triangle or an right angle triangle). In some embodiments, heater legs in the triad cross each other (for example, criss-cross) in the formation. In certain embodiments, triads includes three heaters and/or heater legs arranged sequentially along a straight line.<br>
 <br>
FIG. 17 depicts an embodiment with triads coupled to a horizontal connector well. Triad 270A includes legs 232A, 234A, 236A. Triad 270B includes legs 232B, 234B, 236B. Legs 232A, 234A, 236A and legs 232B, 234B, 236B may be arranged along a straight line on the surface of the formation. In some embodiments, legs 232A, 234A, 236A are arranged along a straight line and offset from legs 232B, 234B, 236B, which may be arranged along a straight line. Legs 232A, 234A, 236A and legs 232B, 234B, 236B include heating elements 242 located in hydrocarbon layer 240. Lead-in conductors 252 couple heating elements 242 to the surface of the formation. Heating elements 242 are coupled to contacting elements 244 at or near the underbidden of the formation. In certain embodiments, transition sections (for example, transition sections 254 depicted in FIG. 11) are located between lead-in conductors 252 and heating elements 242, and/or between heating elements 242 and contacting elements 244.<br>
Contacting elements 244 are coupled to contactor 256 in contacting section 260 to electrically couple legs 232A, 234A, 236A to each other to form triad 270A and electrically couple legs 232B, 234B, 236B to each other to form triad 270B. In certain embodiments, contactor 256 is a ground conductor so that triad 270A and/or triad 270B maybe coupled in three-phase wye configurations. In certain embodiments, triad 270A and triad 270B are . electrically isolated from each other. In some embodiments, triad 270A and triad 270B are electrically coupled to each other (for example, electrically coupled in series or parallel).<br>
In certain embodiments, contactor 256 is a substantially horizontal contactor located in contacting section 260. Contactor 256 may be a casing or a solid rod placed in a wellbore drilled substantially horizontally in contacting section 260. Legs 232A, 234A, 236A and legs 232B, 234B, 236B may be electrically coupled to contactor 256 by any method described herein or any method known in the art For example, containers with thermite powder are coupled to contactor 256 (for example, by welding or brazing the containers to the contactor), legs 232A, 234A, 236A and legs 232B, 234B, 236B are placed inside the containers, and the thermite powder is activated to electrically couple the legs to the contactor. The containers may be coupled to contactor 256 by, for example, placing the containers in holes or recesses in contactor 256 or coupled to the outside of the contactor and then brazing or welding the containers to the contactor.<br>

As an example, FIG. 18 depicts cumulative gas production and cumulative oil production versus time (years) found from a STARS simulation (Computer Modelling Group, LTD., Calgary, Alberta, Canada) using the temperature limited heaters and heater pattern depicted in FIGS. 11 and 13. Curve 278 depicts cumulative oil production (m3) for an initial water saturation of 15%. Curve 280 depicts cumulative gas production (m3) for the initial water saturation of 15%. Curve 282 depicts cumulative oil production (m3) for an initial water saturation of 85%. Curve 284 depicts cumulative gas production (m ) for the initial water saturation of 85%. As shown by the small differences between curves 278 and 282 for cumulative oil production and curves 280 and 284 for cumulative gas production, the initial water saturation does not substantially alter heating of the formation. As a result, the overall production of hydrocarbons from the formation is also not substantially changed by the initial water saturation. Using the temperature limited heaters inhibits variances in heating of the formation that otherwise may be caused by the differences in the initial water saturation.<br>
