				<td>The present invention relates to an improved method of fabricating products by welding the joints between steel plates of high tensile strength (570 MPa min). ,<br>
The invention relates more particularly to fabricating products from steel plates of tensile strength 570 MPa and<br>
above,   and of thickness upto 38 mm by optimising the welding technique followed  for Joining the ends of the plates to ensure durable performance of the fabricated products in iiaeir<br>
end-use applications.	<br>
In a pending Indian patent applicationNo.1663/DEL/1997   <br>
dated 20th June 1997  .<br>
by the applicants,   a process of producing sound welded joints in atmospheric- and marine- corrosion resistant steel bars using   'shielded metal arc welding'   (SMAW) technique has been<br>
disolosed.	<br>
In another pending Indian patent applicationNo. 2023/DEL/1997<br>
dated 21st July  1997 at Patent Branch Office at New Delhi on 29th July..<br>
1997 by the applicants, a process of producing sound welded<br>
joints in atmospheric- and marine- corrosion resistant steel<br>
bars using 'gas metal arc welding' (GMAW) technique has been disclosed.<br>
The existing products fabricated by welding the joints in steel plates of high tensile strength are generally found to be of relatively low tensile strength and impact emergy at the joints with consequent occasional failures of the products at their joints in end-use applications thereof.<br><br>
The object of the invention is to provide an optimised welding method for joining steel plates of high tensile strength so that the joints in the products fabricated from the plates are of adequate tensile strength and impact energy, to ensure failure-free performance of the joints in end use of the products.<br>
The 'shielded metal arc welding1 (SMAW) technique has been followed in welding the joints between the ends of steel plates of high tensile strength by optimising the operating parameters with a view to increasing the tensile strength and impact energy of the welded joints formed in fabricating the products from the steel plates by carrying out extensive investigations on the effects of various parameters of the welding operations on the tensile strength and impact energy of the joints between ends of the steel plates made by welding.<br>
In the SMAW technique of welding an electric arc is struckbetween the tip of an electrode rod and the ends of the steel plates to be joined by momentarily touching the plate ends with the tip of the electrode to allow an electric current to flow through the electrode rod into the steel plates, and produce an arc by withdrawing the electrode tip from the ends of the plates to a given distance. The heat generated in the arc melts the steel plate ends and also the metal at the electrode tip. The molten electrode metal mixes with the molten steel at the joinirgends of the plates, and the mixed metal is deposited on cooling to form the welded joint of the<br><br>
steel plates. The electrode rod is coated with a material<br>
which on heating melts to form a slag which shields the welded joint,<br>
and a gas which envelopes the arc, and thereby prevents oxidation of the welded joint during the welding operation.<br>
The specified chemical composition and mechanical properties of the steel plates of high tensile strength used to produce the fabricated products by welding the ends thereof are presented in Tables I and II respectively.<br>
The invention is described fully and particularly without restricting the scope of the invention in any manner with reference to the accompanying drawings in which<br>
Figure 1 shows the optimum shape of the joined ends of steel plates of thickness t :  (A) upto 12.5 mm, (B) between<br>
12.5 and 25.0 mm, and (C) from 25.0 to 32.0 mm; Figure 2 shows the steps followed in the method.<br>
Referring to Fig. I(A) showing the optimised shape<br>
of the joined end of each plate of thickness t upto 12.5 mm, a lower vertical part v of thickness t/6 is at the bottom and an upper inwardly inclined part 1 of thickness 5t/6 is inclined at an angle a of 35° with the vertical Part. The vertical parts of the joined ends of the two plates p and p' are separated from each other with a gap: of t/5.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1(B) showing the optimised shape of the joined end of each plate of thickness t between 12.5 and 25.0 mm, a vertical Part v is of thickness t/6 with the middle point thereof lying at thickness t/2 and the inclined parts i and i' of each plate are inclined inwardly at an angle a of 35° with the vertical Part and each of thickness 5t/12. The vertical parts of the joined ends of the two plates<br><br>
p and p' are separated from each other with a gap of t/5.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1(C) showing the optimised shape of the joined end of each plate of thickness from 25.0 to 32.0 mm, a vertical Part v is of thickness t/6with the middle point thereof lying at thickness t/3 from the bottom, and a lower inwardly inclined part i' of the thickness t/A and an upper inwardly inclined parti of thickness 7t/12 of each plate are inclined at an angle a of 35° with the vertical part. The vertical parts of the joined ends of the two plates p and p1 are separated from each other with a gap of t/5.<br>
Besides optimising the shape of the ends of plates of different thickness as illustrated and described, the other Parameters of the SMAW technique optimised for welding in the invented method of fabrication are :<br>
(i)  type of the electrode rod selected (ii)  diameter of the electrode rod used (iii)  rebaking temperature and time for the electrode<br>
rod used (iv)  number of passes of the electrode rod tip over the<br>
welded area<br>
(v)  inter-pass temperature of the electrode rod (vi)  heat input from the arc into the electrode rod<br>
during welding (vii)  welding current and voltage for electrode rods of<br>
different diameter<br>
(viii)  preheating temperature and heat input of ends of plate of different thickness and carbon equivalent level.<br><br>
The optimised particulars of the abovementioned parameters of the welding operations followed  are presented in Table III.<br>
The soundness of the weld formed has been examined by  liquid penetration inspection,  magnetic particle inspection and radiography,   and found to be  satisfactory.<br>
The mechanical properties  at the welded joints have been studied.    The tensile strength,  impact energy  (Charpy V-notch)  and bend  at the welded joints have been found respectively to be 603-610 MPa;   105-107 J at 25°C,  72-82 J at 0°C and 56-57 J at -20°C;  and 3T without any crack.    These properties  are well above the minimum specified requirements for durable performance of the products in their end-use applications.<br>
Field  trials conducted  on the products  fabricated in the  invented method have indicated that the chances  of their failures in end-use are reduced appreciably.<br><br>
