				<td>The present invention relates to quinazoline compound.<br>
The present invention relates to quinazolihe derivatives, processes for their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing them as active ingredient, methods for the treatment of disease states associated with angiogenesis and/or increased vascular permeability, to their use as medicaments and to their use in the manufacture of medicaments for use in the production of antiangiogenic and/or vascular permeability reducing effects in warm-blooded animals such as humans.<br>
Normal angiogenesis plays an important role in a variety of processes including embryonic development, wound healing and several components of female reproductive function. Undesirable or pathological angiogenesis has been associated with disease states including diabetic retinopathy, psoriasis, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, atheroma, Kaposi's sarcoma and haemangioma (Fan et al, 1995, Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 16: 57-66; Folkman, 1995, Nature Medicine 1: 27-31). Alteration of vascular permeability is thought to play a role in both normal and pathological physiological processes (Cullinan-Bove et al, 1993, Endocrinology 133: 829-837; Senger et al, 1993, Cancer and Metastasis Reviews, 12: 303-324). Several polypeptides with in vitro endothelial cell growth promoting activity have been identified including, acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors (aFGF &amp; bFGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). By virtue of the restricted expression of its receptors, the growth factor activity of VEGF, in contrast to that of the FGFs, is relatively specific towards endothelial cells. Recent evidence indicates that VEGF is an important stimulator of both normal and pathological angiogenesis (Jakeman et al, 1993, Endocrinology, 133: 848-859; Kolch et al, 1995, Breast Cancer Research and Treatment, 36:139-155) and vascular permeability (Connolly et al, 1989, J. Biol. Chem. 264: 20017-20024). Antagonism of VEGF action by sequestration of VEGF with antibody can result in inhibition of tumour growth (Kim et al, 1993, Nature 362: 841-844).<br>
Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are important in the transmission of biochemical signals across the plasma membrane of cells. These transmembrane molecules characteristically consist of an extracellular ligand-binding domain connected through a segment in the plasma membrane to an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Binding of ligand to the receptor results in stimulation of the receptor-associated tyrosine kinase activity which<br><br>
leads to phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on both the receptor and other intracellular molecules. These changes in tyrosine phosphorylation initiate a signalling cascade leading to a variety of cellular responses. To date, at least nineteen distinct RTK subfamilies, defined by amino acid sequence homology, have been identified. One of these subfamilies is presently comprised by the fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor, Fit or Fltl, the kinase insert domain-containing receptor, KDR (also referred to as Flk-1), and another fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor, Flt4. Two of these related RTKs, Fit and KDR, have been shown to bind VEGF with high affinity (De Vries et al, 1992, Science 255: 989-991; Terman et al, 1992, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1992, 187: 1579-1586). Binding of VEGF to these receptors expressed in heterologous cells has been associated with changes in the tyrosine phosphorylation status of cellular proteins and calcium fluxes.<br>
European Patent Publication No. 0326330 discloses certain quinoline, quinazoline and cinnoline plant fungicides. Certain of these plant fungicides are also stated to possess insecticidal and miticidal activity. There is however no disclosure or any suggestion that any of the compounds disclosed may be used for any purpose in animals such as humans. In particular, the European Patent Publication contains no teaching whatsoever concerning angiogenesis and/or increased vascular permeability mediated by growth factors such as VEGF.<br>
European Patent Publication No. 0566226 discloses anilinoquinazolines which have activity against epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor tyrosine kinase. EP 0566226 contains no teaching whatsoever concerning angiogenesis and/or increased vascular permeability mediated by growth factors such as VEGF. Moreover compounds of EP 0566226 which have been tested do not show significant activity against VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase.<br>
The present invention is based on the surprising discovery that certain quinazolines inhibit the effects of VEGF, a property of value in the treatment of disease states associated with angiogenesis and/or increased vascular permeability such as cancer, diabetes, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, KLaposi's sarcoma, haemangioma, acute and chronic nephropathies, atheroma, arterial restenosis, autoimmune diseases, acute inflammation and ocular diseases with retinal vessel proliferation. Compounds of the present invention possess good activity against VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase whilst possessing some activity against EGF receptor tyrosine kinase. Furthermore, some compounds of the present invention, possess substantially higher potency against VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase than against EGF receptor tyrosine<br>
kinase or FGF Rl receptor tyrosine kinase. Thus certain compounds of the invention which have been tested possess activity against VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase such that they may be used in an amount sufficient to inhibit VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase whilst demonstrating no significant activity against EOF receptor tyrosine kinase or FGF Rl receptor tyrosine kinase. While we do not wish to be bound by theoretical considerations such compounds may for example be of interest in treating tumours which are associated with VEGF, especially those tumours which are dependent on VEGF for their growth.<br>
Other compounds of the invention possess good activity against both VEGF and EGF receptor tyrosine kinases. Indeed certain compounds possess substantially equivalent activities against VEGF and EGF receptor tyrosine kinases. It is believed that these compounds may be of interest in treating tumour states associated with both VEGF and EGF, especially where a patient is suffering from a condition in which tumours are present which are dependent on both VEGF and EGF for their growth.<br>

For the avoidance of doubt it is to be understood that where in this specification a group is qualified by 'hereinbefore defined' or 'defined hereinbefore' the said group encompasses the first occurring and broadest definition as well as each and all of the preferred definitions for that group.<br>
In this specification unless stated otherwise the term "alky!" includes both straight and branched chain alkyl groups but references to individual alkyl groups such as "propyl" are specific for the straight chain version only. An analogous convention applies to other generic terms. Unless otherwise stated the term "alkyl" advantageously refers to chains with 1-6 carbon atoms, preferably 1-4 carbon atoms. The term "alkoxy" as used herein, unless stated otherwise includes "alkyl"-O- groups in which "alkyl" is as hereinbefore defined. The term "aryl" as used herein unless stated otherwise includes reference to a C6.,0 aryl group which may, if desired, carry one or more substituents selected from halogeno, alkyl, alkoxy, nitro, trifluoromethyl and cyano, (wherein alkyl and alkoxy are as hereinbefore defined). The term "aryloxy" as used herein unless otherwise stated includes "aryl"-O-groups in which "aryl" is as hereinbefore defined. The term "sulphonyloxy" as used herein refers to alkylsulphonyloxy and arylsulphonyloxy groups in which "alkyl" and "aryl" are as hereinbefore defined. The term "alkanoyl" as used herein unless otherwise stated includes formyl and alkylC=O groups in which "alkyl" is as defined hereinbefore, for example C2alkanoyl is ethanoyl and refers to CH3C=O, C|alkanoyl is formyl and refers to CHO. In this specification unless stated otherwise the term "alkenyl" includes both straight and branched chain alkenyl groups but references to<br>
individual alkenyl groups such as 2-butenyl are specific for the straight chain version only. Unless otherwise stated the term "alkenyl" advantageously refers to chains with 2-5 carbon atoms, preferably 3-5 carbon atoms. In this specification unless stated otherwise the term "alkynyl" includes both straight and branched chain alkynyl groups but references to individual alkynyl groups such as 2-butynyl are specific for the straight chain version only. Unless otherwise stated the term "alkynyl" advantageously refers to chains with 2-5 carbon atoms, preferably 3-5 carbon atoms.<br>
In formula I, as hereinbefore defined, hydrogen will be present at positions 2 and 8 of the quinazoline group.<br>
Within the present invention it is to be understood that a compound of the formula I or a salt thereof may exhibit the phenomenon of tautomerism and that the formulae drawings within this specification can represent only one of the possible tautomeric forms. It is to be understood that the invention encompasses any tautomeric form which inhibits VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity and is not to be limited merely to any one tautomeric form utilised within the formulae drawings.<br>
It is also to be understood that certain compounds of the formula I and salts thereof can exist in solvated as well as unsolvated forms such as, for example, hydrated forms. It is to be understood that the invention encompasses all such solvated forms which inhibit VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity.<br>
For the avoidance of any doubt, it is to be understood that when X1 is, for example, a group of formula -NR7CO-, it is the nitrogen atom bearing the R7 group which is attached to the quinazoline ring and the carbonyl (CO) group is attached to R4, whereas when X1 is, for example, a group of formula -CONR8-, it is the carbonyl group which is attached to the quinazoline ring and the nitrogen atom bearing the R8 group is attached to R4. A similar convention applies to the other two atom X1 linking groups such as -NR'°SO2- and -SO2NR9-. When X' is -NR"- it is the nitrogen atom bearing the R" group which is linked to the quinazoline ring and to R4. An analogous convention applies to other groups, thus when R4 is, for example, a group of the formula C,.5alkylX5R27 and X5 is a group -NR28CO-, it is the nitrogen atom bearing the R28 group which is attached to the alkyl chain which is attached to the quinazoline ring and the carbonyl (CO) group is attached to R27, whereas when X5 is, for example, a group of formula -CONR29-, it is the carbonyl group which is attached to the alkyl<br>
chain which is attached to the quinazoline ring and the nitrogen atom bearing the R29 group is attached to R27. It is further to be understood that when X1 represents -NR11- and R" is C,. ,alkoxyC2.3alkyl it is the C2.3alkyl moiety which is linked to the nitrogen atom of X1 and an analogous convention applies to other groups.<br>
For the avoidance of any doubt, it is to be understood that in a compound of the formula I when R4 is, for example, a group of formula C|.5alkylX2Ci.5alkylX3R16, it is the terminal C,.5alkyl moiety which is bound to X1, similarly when R4 is, for example, a group of formula C2.5alkenylR14 it is the C2.5alkenyl moiety which is bound to X1 and an analgous convention applies to other groups. When R4 is a group l-R33prop-l-en-3-yl it is the first carbon to which the group R33 is attached and it is the third carbon which is linked to X1, similarly when R4 is a group 2-R33pent-3-en-5-yl it is the second carbon to which the group R" is attached and it is the fifth carbon which is linked to X1, and an analogous convention applies to other groups.<br>
The present invention relates to the compounds of formula I as hereinbefore defined as well as to the salts thereof. Salts for use in pharmaceutical compositions will be pharmaceutically acceptable salts, but other salts may be useful in the production of the compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the invention may, for example, include acid addition salts of the compounds of formula I as hereinbefore defined which are sufficiently basic to form such salts. Such acid addition salts include for example salts with inorganic or organic acids affording pharmaceutically acceptable anions such as with hydrogen halides (especially hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid of which hydrochloric acid is particularly preferred) or with sulphuric or phosphoric acid, or with trifluoroacetic, citric or maleic acid. In addition where the compounds of formula I are sufficiently acidic, pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be formed with an inorganic or organic base which affords a pharmaceutically acceptable cation. Such salts with inorganic or organic bases include for example an alkali metal salt, such as a sodium or potassium salt, an alkaline earth metal salt such as a calcium or magnesium salt, an ammonium salt or for example a salt with methylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, piperidine, morpholine or lris-(2-hydroxyethyl)amine.<br>
A compound of the formula I, or salt thereof, and other compounds of the invention (as hereinafter defined) may be prepared by any process known to be applicable to the<br>
preparation of chemically-related compounds. Such processes include, for example, those illustrated in European Patent Applications, Publication Nos. 0520722, 0566226, 0602851 and 0635498. Such processes, are provided as a further feature of the invention and are as described hereinafter. Necessary starting materials may be obtained by standard procedures of organic chemistry. The preparation of such starting materials is described within the accompanying non-limiting Examples. Alternatively necessary starting materials are obtainable by analogous procedures to those illustrated which are within the ordinary skill of an organic chemist.<br>
Thus the following processes (a) to (g) and (i) to (v) constitute further features of the present invention. Synthesis of Compounds of Formula I<br>
(a) Compounds of the formula I and salts thereof may be prepared by the reaction of a compound of the formula III:<br><br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
 (wherein R1, R2, X1 and R4 are as defined hereinbefore and L' is a displaceable moiety), with a compound of the formula IV: <br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
(wherein R3 and m are as defined hereinbefore) whereby to obtain compounds of the formula I and salts thereof. A convenient displaceable moiety L1 is, for example, a halogeno, alkoxy (preferably CMalkoxy), aryloxy or sulphonyloxy group, for example a chloro, bromo, methoxy, phenoxy, methanesulphonyloxy or toluene-4-sulphonyloxy group.<br>
The reaction is advantageously effected in the presence of either an acid or a base. Such an acid is, for example, an anhydrous inorganic acid such as hydrogen chloride. Such a base is, for example, an organic amine base such as, for example, pyridine, 2,6-lutidine, collidine, 4-dimethylaminopyridine, triethylamine, morpholine, N-methylmorpholine or diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene, or for example, an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal carbonate or hydroxide, for example sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, calcium carbonate, sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide. Alternatively such a base is, for example, an alkali metal hydride, for example sodium hydride, or an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal amide, for example sodium amide or sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide. The reaction is preferably effected in the presence of an inert solvent or diluent, for example an alkanol or ester such as methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol or ethyl acetate, a halogenated solvent such as methylene chloride, trichloromethane or carbon tetrachloride, an ether such as tetrahydrofuran or 1,4-dioxan, an aromatic hydrocarbon solvent such as toluene, or a dipolar aprotic solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidin-2-one or dimethylsulphoxide. The reaction is conveniently effected at a temperature in the range, for example, 10 to 150°C, preferably in the range 20 to 80°C.<br>
The compound of the invention may be obtained from this process in the form of the tree base or alternatively it may be obtained in the form of a salt with the acid of the formula II-L1 wherein L1 has the meaning defined hereinbefore. When it is desired to obtain the free base from the salt, the salt may be treated with a base as defined hereinbefore using a conventional procedure.<br>
(b) Where the group of formula Ha:<br>
 (Figure Remove) <br>
(wherein R3 and m are as hereinbefore defined) represents a phenyl group carrying one or more hydroxy groups, a compound of the formula I and salts thereof can be prepared by the deprotection of a compound of formula V:<br><br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
 (wherein X1, m, R1, R2. R3 and R4 are as hereinbefore defined, P represents a phenolic hydroxy protecting group and pi is an integer from 1 to 5 equal to the number of protected hydroxy groups and such that m-pl is equal to the number of R3 substituents which are not protected hydroxy). The choice of phenolic hydroxy protecting group P is within the standard knowledge of an organic chemist, for example those included in standard texts such as "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis" T.W. Greene and R.G.M.Wuts, 2nd Ed. Wiley 1991, including ethers (for example, methyl, methoxymethyl, allyl and benzyl and benzyl substituted with up to two substituents selected from CMalkoxy and nitro), silyl ethers (for example, t-butyldiphenylsilyl and t-butyldimethylsilyl), esters (for example, acetate and benzoate) and carbonates (for example, methyl and benzyl and benzyl substituted with up to two substituents selected from C,.4alkoxy and nitro). The removal of such a phenolic hydroxy protecting group may be effected by any of the procedures known for such a transformation, including those reaction conditions indicated in standard texts such as that indicated hereinbefore, or by a related procedure. The reaction conditions preferably being such that the hydroxy derivative is produced without unwanted reactions at other sites within the starting or product compounds. For example, where the protecting group P is acetate, the transformation may conveniently be effected by treatment of the quinazoline derivative with a base as defined hereinbefore and including ammonia, and its mono and di-alkylated derivatives, preferably in the presence of a protic solvent or co-solvent such as water or an alcohol, for example methanol or ethanol. Such<br>
a reaction can be effected in the presence of an additional inert solvent or diluent as defined hereinbefore and at a temperature in the range 0 to 50°C, conveniently at about 20°C.<br>
(c) Production of those compounds of formula I and salts thereof wherein the substituent X1 is -O-, -S- or -NR1'- or -SO2-, -CONR8- or -SO2NR9- can be achieved by the reaction, conveniently in the presence of a base as defined hereinbefore, of a compound of the formula VI: <br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
 (wherein m, X , R , R~ and R are as hereinbefore defined) with a compound of formula VII:<br>
 (wherein R4 and L' are as hereinbefore defined); L1 is a displaceable moiety for example a halogeno or sulphonyloxy group such as a bromo or methanesulphonyloxy group.

The identification of compounds which potently inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity associated with the VEGF receptors such as Fit and/or KDR and which inhibit angiogenesis and/or increased vascular permeability is desirable and is the subject of the present invention. These properties may be assessed, for example, using one or more of the procedures set out below: (a) In Vitro Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibition Test<br>
This assay determines the ability of a test compound to inhibit tyrosine kinase activity. DNA encoding VEGF or epidermal growth factor (EOF) receptor cytoplasmic domains may be obtained by total gene synthesis (Edwards M, International Biotechnology Lab 5(3), 19-25, 1987) or by cloning. These may then be expressed in a suitable expression system to obtain polypeptide with tyrosine kinase activity. For example VEGF and EGF<br>
receptor cytoplasmic domains, which were obtained by expression of recombinant protein in insect cells, were found to display intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. In the case of the VEGF receptor Fit (Genbank accession number X51602), a 1.7kb DNA fragment encoding most of the cytoplasmic domain, commencing with methionine 783 and including the termination codon, described by Shibuya et al (Oncogene, 1990, 5: 519-524), was isolated from cDNA and cloned into a baculovirus transplacement vector (for example pAcYMl (see The Baculovirus Expression System: A Laboratory Guide, L.A. King and R. D. Possee, Chapman and Hall, 1992) or pAc360 or pBlueBacHis (available from Invitrogen Corporation)). This recombinant construct was co-transfected into insect cells (for example Spodoptera frugiperda 21(Sf21)) with viral DNA (eg Pharmingen BaculoGold) to prepare recombinant baculovirus. (Details of the methods for the assembly of recombinant DNA molecules and the preparation and use of recombinant baculovirus can be found in standard texts for example Sambrook et al, 1989, Molecular cloning - A Laboratory Manual, 2nd edition, Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory Press and O'Reilly et al, 1992, Baculovirus Expression Vectors - A Laboratory Manual, W. H. Freeman and Co, New York). For other tyrosine kinases for use in assays, cytoplasmic fragments starting from methionine 806 (KDR, Genbank accession number L04947) and methionine 668 (EGF receptor, Genbank accession number X00588) may be cloned and expressed in a similar manner.<br>
For expression of cFlt tyrosine kinase activity, Sf21 cells were infected with plaque-pure cFlt recombinant virus at a multiplicity of infection of 3 and harvested 48 hours later. Harvested cells were washed with ice cold phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS) (lOmM sodium phosphate pH7.4, 138mM sodium chloride, 2.7mM potassium chloride) then resuspended in ice cold HNTG/PMSF (20mM Hepes pH7.5, 150mM sodium chloride, 10% v/v glycerol, 1% v/v Triton XI00, 1.5mM magnesium chloride, ImM ethylene glycoL bis(paminoethyl ether) N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), ImM PMSF (phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride); the PMSF is added just before use from a freshly-prepared lOOmM solution in methanol) using 1ml HNTG/PMSF per 10 million cells. The suspension was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 13,000 rpm at 4°C, the supernatant (enzyme stock) was removed and stored in aliquots at -70°C. Each new batch of stock enzyme was titrated in the assay by dilution with enzyme diluent (lOOmM Hepes pH 7.4, 0.2mM sodium orthovanadate,<br>
0.1% v/v Triton X100, 0.2mM dithiothreitol). For a typical batch, stock enzyme is diluted 1 in 2000 with enzyme diluent and 50ul of dilute enzyme is used for each assay well.<br>
A stock of substrate solution was prepared from a random copolymer containing tyrosine, for example Poly (Glu, Ala, Tyr) 6:3:1 (Sigma P3899), stored as 1 mg/ml stock in PBS at -20°C and diluted 1 in 500 with PBS for plate coating.<br>
On the day before the assay lOOul of diluted substrate solution was dispensed into all wells of assay plates (Nunc maxisorp 96-well immunoplates) which were sealed and left overnight at 4°C.<br>
On the day of the assay the substrate solution was discarded and the assay plate wells were washed once with PBST (PBS containing 0.05% v/v Tween 20) and once with 50mM Hepes pH7.4.<br>
Test compounds were diluted with 10% dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) and 25ul of diluted compound was transferred to wells in the washed assay plates. "Total" control wells contained 10% DMSO instead of compound. Twenty five microlitres of 40mM manganese(II)chloride containing 8uM adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) was added to all test wells except "blank" control wells which contained manganese(II)chloride without ATP. To start the reactions 50ul of freshly diluted enzyme was added to each well and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes. The liquid was then discarded and the wells were washed twice with PBST. One hundred microlitres of mouse IgG anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc. product 05-321), diluted 1 in 6000 with PBST containing 0.5% w/v bovine serum albumin (BSA), was added to each well and the plates were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature before discarding the liquid and washing the wells twice with PBST. One hundred microlitres of horse radish peroxidase (HRP)-linked sheep anti-mouse Ig antibody (Amersham product NXA 931), diluted 1 in 500 with PBST containing 0.5% w/v BSA, was added and the plates were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature before discarding the liquid and washing the wells twice with PBST. One hundred microlitres of 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) solution, freshly prepared using one 50mg ABTS tablet (Boehringer 1204 521) in 50ml freshly prepared 50mM phosphate-citrate buffer pH5.0 + 0.03% sodium perborate (made with I phosphate citrate buffer with sodium perborate (PCSB) capsule (Sigma P4922) per 100ml distilled water), was added to each well. Plates were then incubated for 20-60 minutes at<br>
room temperature until the optical density value of the "total" control wells, measured at 405nm using a plate reading spectrophotometer, was approximately 1.0. "Blank" (no ATP) and "total" (no compound) control values were used to determine the dilution range of test compound which gave 50% inhibtion of enzyme activity.<br>
(b)	In Vitro HUVEC Proliferation Assay<br>
This assay determines the ability of a test compound to inhibit the growth factor-stimulated proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC).<br>
HUVEC cells were isolated in MCDB 131 (Gibco BRL) + 7.5% v/v foetal calf serum (PCS) and were plated out (at passage 2 to 8), in MCDB 131+ 2% v/v PCS + 3jig/ml heparin + lfj,g/ml hydrocortisone, at a concentration of 1000 cells/well in 96 well plates. After a minimum of 4 hours they were dosed with the appropriate growth factor (i.e. VEGF 3ng/ml, EOF 3ng/ml or b-PGF 0.3ng/ml) and compound. The cultures were then incubated for 4 days at 37°C with 7.5% carbon dioxide. On day 4 the cultures were pulsed with luCi/well of tritiated-thymidine (Amersharn product TRA 61) and incubated for 4 hours. The cells were harvested using a 96-well plate harvester (Tomtek) and then assayed for incorporation of tritium with a Beta plate counter. Incorporation of radioactivity into cells, expressed as cpm, was used to measure inhibition of growth factor-stimulated cell proliferation by compounds.<br>
(c)	In Vivo Rat Uterine Oedema Assay<br>
This test measures the capacity of compounds to reduce the acute increase in uterine weight in rats which occurs in the first 4-6 hours following oestrogen stimulation. This early increase in uterine weight has long been known to be due to oedema caused by increased permeability of the uterine vasculature and recently Cullinan-Bove and Koos (Endocrinology, 1993,133:829-837) demonstrated a close temporal relationship with increased expression of VEGF mRNA in the uterus. We have found that prior treatment of the rats with a neutralising monoclonal antibody to VEGF significantly reduces the acute increase in uterine weight, confirming that the increase in weight is substantially mediated by VEGF.<br>
Groups of 20 to 22-day old rats were treated with a single subcutaneous dose of oestradiol benzoate (2.5u.g/rat) in a solvent, or solvent only. The latter served as unstimulated controls. Test compounds were orally administered at various times prior to the administration of oestradiol benzoate. Five hours after the administration of oestradiol benzoate the rats were humanely sacrificed and their uteri were dissected, blotted and weighed. The increase in<br>
uterine weight in groups treated with test compound and oestradiol benzoate and with oestradiol benzoate alone was compared using a Student T test. Inhibition of the effect of oestradiol benzoate was considered significant when p

As stated above the size of the dose required for the therapeutic or prophylactic treatment of a particular disease state will necessarily be varied depending on the host treated, the route of administration and the severity of the illness being treated. Preferably a daily dose in the range of 1 -50mg/kg is employed. However the daily dose will necessarily be varied depending upon the host treated, the particular route of administration, and the severity of the illness being treated. Accordingly the optimum dosage may be determined by the practitioner who is treating any particular patient.<br>
The antiangiogenic and/or vascular permeability reducing treatment defined hereinbefore may be applied as a sole therapy or may involve, in addition to a compound of the invention, one or more other substances and/or treatments. Such conjoint treatment may be achieved by way of the simultaneous, sequential or separate administration of the individual components of the treatment. In the field of medical oncology it is normal practice to use a combination of different forms of treatment to treat each patient with cancer. In medical oncology the other component(s) of such conjoint treatment in addition to the antiangiogenic and/or vascular permeability reducing treatment defined hereinbefore may be: surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Such chemotherapy may cover three main categories of therapeutic agent:<br>
