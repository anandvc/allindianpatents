This invention relates to a wireless system tor calculating uplink signals transmitted from a plurality of remote tenninals using a common uplink channel.<br>
Wireless communication systems can be used to complement and in some instances replace conventional wired communication systems in areas where conventional wire-line systems are unavailable, unreliable or excessively expensive. Examples of such areas are : rural areas with a small number of widespread users, underdeveloped areas with little or no current infrastructure, reliability sensitive applications in areas where wired infrastructure is unreliable and political environments where monopolistic wired service providers maintain artificially high prices. Even in metropolitan areas and highly developed countries, wireless communication systems may be used for low-cost ubiquitous communication, new flexible data services and emergency communication systems. In general, wireless communication systems may be used for voice communications just Hke conventional telephone systems, and for data communications in a radio-based wide area or local area network as well.<br>
Wireless users access wireless communication systems using remote tenninals such as cellular telephones and data modems equipped with radio transceivers. Such systems (and in particular the remote terminals) have protocols tor initiating calls, receiving calls and general transfer of information. The information transfer can be performed in real-time such as is the case for circuit-switched voice conversations and faxes, or in a store-and forward manner such as is often the case for electronic mail, paging and other similar message transfer systems.<br><br>
Wireless communication systems are generally allocated a portion of the radio frequency spectrum for their operation. The allocated portion of the spectrum is divided up into communication channels. These channels may be distinguished by frequency, by time, by code, or by some combination of the above. Each of these communication channels will be referred to herein as conventional channels. Depending on the available frequency allocations, the wireless system might have from one to several hundred communication channels. To provide fiill-duplex communication links, typically some of the communication channels are used for communication from base stations to users' remote terminals (the downlink) and others are used for communication from users' remote tenninals to base stations (the uphnk).<br>
Wireless communication systems generally have one or more radio base stations, each of which provide coverage to a geographic area known as a cell and often serve as a point-of-presence (PoP) providing connection to a wide area network such as a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). Often a predetermined subset of the available communication channels is assigned to each radio base station in an attempt to minimize the amount of interference experienced by users of the system. Within its cell, a radio base station can communicate simultaneously with many remote terminals by using different conventional communication channels for each remote terminal<br><br><br><br><br><br>
  can be updated infrequently.  !â€¢) general, however, changes in the RF propagation environment<br><br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a wireless system for calculating uplink signals transmitted irom a plurality' of remote terminals using a common uplink channel, said system including at least one base station, said system comprising : receiving means at said at least one base station including a pluralitv of antenna elements and receivers for producing measurements of combinations of said uplink signals from said plurality of remote terminals using said common uplink channel, receive spatial processing means for determining and storing receive spatial signatures for said plurality of remote terminals using said measurements, spatial demultiplexing means using said receive spatial signatures and said measurements to calculate said uplink signals: transmission means including a plurality of transmit antenna elements and transmitters for transmitting multiplexed downlink signals to said plurality of remote terminals using a common downlink chamiel, transmit spatial processing means for determining and storing transmit spatial signatures for said plurality of remote tenninals: and spatial multiplexing means using said transmit spatial signatures and downlink signals to produce said multiplexed downlmk signals.<br>
