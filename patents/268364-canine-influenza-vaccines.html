FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention encompasses influenza vaccines, in particular canine influenza vaccines. The vaccine may be a recombinant poxvirus vaccine or an inactivated vaccine.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Respiratory diseases resembling influenza has infected thousands of dogs in the U.S. Recurrent outbreaks of severe respiratory disease characterized by coughing and fever have occurred in greyhounds at racing kennels. Pathological findings included severe pulmonary and plural hemorrhage, accurate to subacute erosive to hyperplastic tracheitis, bronchitis and bronchiolitis and bronchopneumonia. In 2004, eight greyhounds in Jacksonville, Florida were killed by an equine influenza virus that jumped the species barrier from horses to dogs. Equine influenza is a disease of horses, and the virus is in the same group of viruses that cause flu in people. The disease is present in horse populations throughout Europe, North America and parts of Asia, with horses typically<br>
developing a fever and a dry hacking cough. In the early stages of the disease, horses are reluctant to eat or drink for several days, but usually recover in two to three weeks.<br>
H3N8 subtypes of equine influenza were previously isolated from lungs of two dogs from Florida and one dog fromTexas who had died from the infection. Genetic sequence analyses and phylogenetic comparisons determined that all three canine isolates were closely related and evolved from contemporary strains of equine influenza H3N8. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated influenza antigen in bronchial gland epithelial cells, bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial cells and in alveolar macrophages. Seroconversion to canine influenza virus was demonstrated by hemagglutination inhibition and microneutralization assays. Molecular and antigenic analyses of three influenza viruses isolated from outbreaks of severe respiratory disease in racing greyhounds revealed that they are closely related to H3N8 equine influenza virus (see, e.g., Crawford et al., Science. 2005 Oct 21;310(5747):482-5. Epub 2005 Sep 26). Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the canine influenza virus genomes form a monophyletic group, consistent with a single interspecies virus transfer. Molecular changes in the hemagglutinin suggested adaptive evolution in the new host. The etiologic role of this virus in respiratory disease was supported by the temporal association of rising antibody titers with disease and by experimental inoculation studies. The geographic expansion of the infection and its persistence for several years indicate efficient transmission of canine influenza virus among greyhounds. Evidence of infection in pet dogs suggests that this infection may also become enzootic in this population.<br>
In 2005, a mutated form of the Bird Flu (H3N8 Virus) was reported to have killed greyhounds in Massachusetts.<br>
Accordingly, there is a need for an effective vaccine against influenza in canines. Citation or identification of any document in this application is not an admission that such document is available as prior art to the present invention.<br>

As used herein, the term "antigen" or "immunogen" means a substance that induces a specific immune response in a host animal. The antigen may comprise a whole organism, killed, attenuated or live; a subunit or portion of an organism; a recombinant vector containing an insert with immunogenic properties; a piece or fragment of DNA capable of inducing an immune response upon presentation to a host animal; a protein, a polypeptide, a peptide, an epitope, a hapten, or any combination thereof. Alternately, the immunogen or antigen may comprise a toxin or antitoxin.<br>
The term "immunogenic protein or peptide" as used herein also refers includes peptides and polypeptides that are immunologically active in the sense that once administered to the host, it is able to evoke an immune response of the humoral and/or cellular type directed against the protein. Preferably the protein fragment is such that it has substantially the same immunological activity as the total protein. Thus, a protein fragment according to the invention comprises or consists essentially of or consists of at least one epitope or antigenic determinant. The term epitope relates to a protein site able to induce an immune reaction of the humoral type (B cells) and/or cellular type (T cells).<br>
The term "immunogenic protein or peptide" further contemplates deletions, additions and substitutions to the sequence, so long as the polypeptide functions to produce an immunological response as defined herein. In this regard, particularly preferred substitutions will generally be conservative in nature, i.e., those substitutions that take place within a family of amino acids. For example, amino acids are generally divided into four families: (1) acidic—aspartate and glutamate; (2) basic—lysine, arginine, histidine; (3) non-polar~alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine, tryptophan; and (4) uncharged polar—glycine, asparagine, glutamine, cystine, serine threonine, tyrosine. Phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine are sometimes classified as aromatic amino acids. It is reasonably predictable that an isolated replacement of leucine with isoleucine or valine, or vice versa; an aspartate with a glutamate or vice versa; a threonine with a serine or vice versa; or a similar conservative replacement of an amino acid with a structurally related amino acid, will not have a major effect on the biological activity. Proteins having substantially the same amino acid sequence as the reference molecule but possessing minor amino acid substitutions that do not substantially affect the immunogenicity of the protein are, therefore, within the definition of the reference polypeptide. The term "epitope" refers to the site on an antigen or hapten to which specific B cells and/or T cells respond. The term is also used interchangeably with "antigenic determinant" or "antigenic determinant site". Antibodies that recognize the same epitope can be identified in a simple immunoassay showing the ability of one antibody to block the binding of another antibody to a target antigen. An "immunological response" to a composition or vaccine is the development in the host of a cellular and/or antibody-mediated immune response to a composition or vaccine of interest. Usually, an "immunological response" includes but is not limited to one or more of the following effects: the production of antibodies, B cells, helper T cells,, and/or cytotoxic T cells, directed specifically to an antigen or antigens included in the composition or vaccine of interest. Preferably, the host will display either a therapeutic or protective immunological response such that resistance to new infection will be enhanced and/or the clinical severity of the<br>
disease reduced. Such protection will be demonstrated by either a reduction or lack of symptoms normally displayed by an infected host, a quicker recovery time and/or a lowered viral titer in the infected host.<br>
The terms "immunogenic" protein or polypeptide as used herein also refers to an amino acid sequence which elicits an immunological response as described above. An "immunogenic" protein or polypeptide, as used herein, includes the full-length sequence of the protein, analogs thereof, or immunogenic fragments thereof. By "immunogenic fragment" is meant a fragment of a protein which includes one or more epitopes and thus elicits the immunological response described above. Such fragments can be identified using any number of epitope mapping techniques, well known in the art. See, e.g., Epitope Mapping Protocols in Methods in Molecular Biology, Vol. 66 (Glenn E. Morris, Ed., 1996) Humana Press, Totowa, N.J. For example, linear epitopes may be determined by e.g., concurrently synthesizing large numbers of peptides on solid supports, the peptides corresponding to portions of the protein molecule, and reacting the peptides with antibodies while the peptides are still attached to the supports. Such techniques are known in the art and described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,708,871; Geysen et al. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:3998-4002; Geysen et al. (1986) Molec. Immunol. 23:709-715, all incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. Similarly, conformational epitopes are readily identified by determining spatial conformation of amino acids such as by, e.g., x-ray crystallography and 2-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance. See, e.g., Epitope Mapping Protocols, supra. Methods especially applicable to the proteins of T. parva are fully described in the PCX Application Serial No. PCT/US2004/022605 incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
Synthetic antigens are also included within the definition, for example, polyepitopes, flanking epitopes, and other recombinant or synthetically derived antigens. See, e.g., Bergmann et al. (1993) Eur. J. Immunol. 23:2777-2781; Bergmann et al. (1996) J. Immunol. 157:3242-3249; Suhrbier, A. (1997) Immunol. and Cell Biol. 75:402-408; Gardner et al. (1998) 12th World AIDS Conference, Geneva, Switzerland, Jun. 28-Jul. 3, 1998. Immunogenic fragments,<br>
for purposes of the present invention, will usually include at least about 3 amino acids, preferably at least about 5 amino acids, more preferably at least about 10-15 amino acids, and most preferably 25 or more amino acids, of the molecule. There is no critical upper limit to the length of the fragment, which could comprise nearly the full-length of the protein sequence, or even a fusion protein comprising at least one epitope of the protein.<br>
Accordingly, a minimum structure of a polynucleotide expressing an epitope is that it comprises or consists essentially of or consists of nucleotides to encode an epitope or antigenic determinant of an influenza protein or polyprotein. A polynucleotide encoding a fragment of the total protein or polyprotein, more advantageously, comprises or consists essentially of or consists of a minimum of 21 nucleotides, advantageously at least 42 nucleotides, and preferably at least 57, 87 or 150 consecutive or contiguous nucleotides of the sequence encoding the total protein or polyprotein. Epitope determination procedures, such as, generating overlapping peptide libraries (Hemmer B. et al., Immunology Today, 1998,19 (4), 163-168), Pepscan (Geysen et al., (1984) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA, 81, 3998-4002; Geysen et al., (1985) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA, 82, 178-182; Van der Zee R. et al., (1989) Eur. J. Immunol., 19, 43-47; Geysen H.M., (1990) Southeast Asian J. Trop. Med. Public Health, 21, 523-533; Multipin.RTM. Peptide Synthesis Kits de Chiron) and algorithms (De Groot A. et al., (1999) Nature Biotechnology, 17, 533-561), and in PCT Application Serial No. PCT/US2004/022605 all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties, can be used in the practice of the invention, without undue experimentation. Other documents cited and incorporated herein may also be consulted for methods for determining epitopes of an immunogen or antigen and thus nucleic acid molecules that encode such epitopes.<br>
A "polynucleotide" is a polymeric form of nucleotides of any length, which contain deoxyribonucleotides, ribonucleotides, and analogs in any combination. Polynucleotides may have three-dimensional structure, and may perform any function, known or unknown. The term "polynucleotide" includes double-, single-stranded, and triple-helical molecules. Unless otherwise specified or<br>
required, any embodiment of the invention described herein that is a polynucleotide encompasses both the double stranded form and each of two complementary forms known or predicted to make up the double stranded form of either the DNA, RNA or hybrid molecule.<br>
The following are non-limiting examples of polynucleotides: a gene or gene fragment, exons, introns, mRNA, tRNA, rRNA, ribozymes, cDNA, recombinant polynucleotides, branched polynucleotides, plasmids, vectors, isolated DNA of any sequence, isolated RNA of any sequence, nucleic acid probes and primers. A polynucleotide may comprise modified nucleotides, such as methylated nucleotides and nucleotide analogs, uracyl, other sugars and linking groups such as fluororibose and thiolate, and nucleotide branches. The sequence of nucleotides may be further modified after polymerization, such as by conjugation, with a labeling component. Other types of modifications included in this definition are caps, substitution of one or more of the naturally occurring nucleotides with an analog, and introduction of means for attaching the polynucleotide to proteins, metal ions, labeling components, other polynucleotides or solid support. The polynucleotides can be obtained by chemical synthesis or derived from a microorganism.<br>
The invention further comprises a complementary strand to a polynucleotide encoding an influenza antigen, epitope or immunogen. The complementary strand can be polymeric and of any length, and can contain deoxyribonucleotides, ribonucleotides, and analogs in any combination.<br>
The terms "protein", "peptide", "polypeptide" and "polypeptide fragment" are used interchangeably herein to refer to polymers of amino acid residues of any length. The polymer can be linear or branched, it may comprise modified amino acids or amino acid analogs, and it may be interrupted by chemical moieties other than amino acids. The terms also encompass an amino acid polymer that has been modified naturally or by intervention; for example disulfide bond formation, glycosylation, lipidation, acetylation, phosphorylation, or any other manipulation or modification, such as conjugation with a labeling or bioactive component.<br>
An "isolated" polynucleotide or polypeptide is one that is substantially free of the materials with which it is associated in its native environment. By substantially free, is meant at least 50%, advantageously at least 70%, more advantageously at least 80%, and even more advantageously at least 90% free of these materials. Hybridization reactions can be performed under conditions of different "stringency." Conditions that increase stringency of a hybridization reaction are well known. See for example, "Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual", second edition (Sambrook et al. 1989). Examples of relevant conditions include (in order of increasing stringency): incubation temperatures of 25°C, 37°C, 50°C, and 68°C; buffer concentrations of 10 x SSC, 6 x SSC, 1 x SSC, 0.1 x SSC (where SSC is 0.15 M NaCl and 15 mM citrate buffer) and their equivalent using other buffer systems; formamide concentrations of 0%, 25%, 50%, and 75%; incubation times from 5 minutes to 24 hours; 1, 2 or more washing steps; wash incubation times of 1, 2, or 15 minutes; and wash solutions of 6 x SSC, 1 x SSC, 0.1 x SSC, or deionized water.<br>
The invention further encompasses polynucleotides encoding functionally<br>
equivalent variants and derivatives of the influenza polypeptides and functionally<br>
equivalent fragments thereof which may enhance, decrease or not significantly<br>
affect properties of the polypeptides encoded thereby. These functionally<br>
equivalent variants, derivatives, and fragments display the ability to retain<br>
influenza activity. For instance, changes in a DNA sequence that do not change<br>
the encoded amino acid sequence, as well as those that result in conservative<br>
substitutions of amino acid residues, one or a few amino acid deletions or<br>
additions, and substitution of amino acid residues by amino acid analogs are those<br>
which will not significantly affect properties of the encoded polypeptide.<br>
Conservative amino acid substitutions are glycine/alanine;<br>
valine/isoleucine/Ieucine; asparagine/glutamine; aspartic acid/glutamic acid;<br>
serine/threonine/methionine;	lysine/arginine;	and<br>
phenylalanine/tyrosine/tryptophan. In one embodiment, the variants have at least 50%, at least 55%, at least 60%, at least 65%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 86%, at least 87%, at least 88%, at least 89%, at least<br>
90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98% or at least 99% homology or identity to the influenza polynucleotide or polypeptide of interest.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, sequence identity or homology is determined by comparing the sequences when aligned so as to maximize overlap and identity while minimizing sequence gaps. In particular, sequence identity may be determined using any of a number of mathematical algorithms. A nonlimiting example of a mathematical algorithm used for comparison of two sequences is the algorithm of Karlin &amp; Altschul, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1990; 87: 2264-2268, modified as in Karlin &amp; Altschul, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1993;90: 5873-5877.<br>
Another example of a mathematical algorithm used for comparison of sequences is the algorithm of Myers &amp; Miller, CABIOS 1988;4: 11-17. Such an algorithm is incorporated into the ALIGN program (version 2.0) which is part of the GCG sequence alignment software package. When utilizing the ALIGN program for comparing amino acid sequences, a PAM120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12, and a gap penalty of 4 can be used. Yet another useful algorithm for identifying regions of local sequence similarity and alignment is the FASTA algorithm as described in Pearson &amp; Lipman, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1988; 85: 2444-2448.<br>
Advantageous for use according to the present invention is the WU-BLAST (Washington University BLAST) version 2.0 software. WU-BLAST version 2.0 executable programs for several UNIX platforms can be downloaded from ftp ://blast.wustl.edu/blast/executables. This program is based on WU-BLAST version 1.4, which in turn is based on the public domain NCBI-BLAST version 1.4 (Altschul &amp; Gish, 1996, Local alignment statistics, Doolittle ed., Methods in Enzymology 266: 460-480; Altschul et al., Journal of Molecular Biology 1990; 215: 403-410; Gish &amp; States, 1993;Nature Genetics 3: 266-272; Karlin &amp; Altschul, 1993;Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90: 5873-5877; all of which are incorporated by reference herein).<br>
In general, comparison of amino acid sequences is accomplished by aligning an amino acid sequence of a polypeptide of a known structure with the amino acid sequence of a the polypeptide of unknown structure. Amino acids in the sequences are then compared and groups of amino acids that are homologous are grouped together. This method detects conserved regions of the polypeptides and accounts for amino acid insertions and deletions. Homology between amino acid sequences can be determined by using commercially available algorithms (see also the description of homology above). In addition to those otherwise mentioned herein, mention is made too of the programs BLAST, gapped BLAST, BLASTN, BLASTP, and PSI-BLAST, provided by the National Center for Biotechnology Information. These programs are widely used in the art for this purpose and can align homologous regions of two amino acid sequences. In all search programs in the suite the gapped alignment routines are integral to the database search itself. Gapping can be turned off if desired. The default penalty (Q) for a gap of length one is Q=9 for proteins and BLASTP, and Q=10 for BLASTN, but may be changed to any integer. The default per-residue penalty for extending a gap (R) is R=2 for proteins and BLASTP, and R=10 for BLASTN, but may be changed to any integer. Any combination of values for Q and R can be used in order to align sequences so as to maximize overlap and identity while minimizing sequence gaps. The default amino acid comparison matrix is BLOSUM62, but other amino acid comparison matrices such as PAM can be utilized.<br>
Alternatively or additionally, the term "homology " or "identity", for instance, with respect to a nucleotide or amino acid sequence, can indicate a quantitative measure of homology between two sequences. The percent sequence homology can be calculated as<br>
(Nref  - Ndif )*100/Nref , wherein Ndif  is the total number of non-identical residues in the two sequences when aligned and wherein Nref  is the number of residues in one of the sequences. Hence, the DNA sequence AGTCAGTC will<br>
have a sequence identity of 75% with the sequence AATCAATC (Nref  = 8;<br>
Alternatively or additionally, "homology" or "identity" with respect to sequences can refer to the number of positions with identical nucleotides or amino acids divided by the number of nucleotides or amino acids in the shorter of the two sequences wherein alignment of the two sequences can be determined in accordance with the Wilbur and Lipman algorithm (Wilbur &amp; Lipman, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1983; 80:726, incorporated herein by reference), for instance, using a window size of 20 nucleotides, a word length of 4 nucleotides, and a gap penalty of 4, and computer-assisted analysis and interpretation of the sequence data including alignment can be conveniently performed using commercially available programs (e.g., Intelligenetics ™ Suite, Intelligenetics Inc. CA). When RNA sequences are said to be similar, or have a degree of sequence identity or homology with DNA sequences, thymidine (T) in the DNA sequence is considered equal to uracil (U) in the RNA sequence. Thus, RNA sequences are within the scope of the invention and can be derived from DNA sequences, by thymidine (T) in the DNA sequence being considered equal to uracil (U) in RNA sequences.<br>
And, without undue experimentation, the skilled artisan can consult with many other programs or references for determining percent homology. The invention further encompasses the influenza polynucleotides contained in a vector molecule or an expression vector and operably linked to a promoter element and optionally to an enhancer.<br>
The vector is advantageously a poxvirus, particularly a vaccinia virus or an avipox virus, such as fowlpox virus and canarypox virus. Advantageously, the virus is a canarypox virus. Advantageous canarypox strains may be an attenuated strain. The vector can express at least one epitope from Kentucky strains, Newmarket strains and/or Ohio strains. Advantageous canarypox constructs include, but are not limited to, vCP 1529, vCP 1533 and vCP 2242. Recombinant avipox viruses (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,505,941 and 5,756,103), such as an attenuated recombinant canarypox virus, for instance ALVAC, or an attenuated fowlpox<br><br>
virus, for instance TROVAC, are especially advantageous. In one advantageous embodiment, the recombinant ALVAC vaccine described by Edlund Toulemonde et al., Vet Rec. 2005 Mar 19;156(12):367-71 may be used as a canine influenza vaccine. Other viruses that may be used in methods of the invention include, but are not limited to, vaccinia viruses, such as an attenuated vaccinia virus, for instance NYVAC, adenoviruses, such as canine adenoviruses (CAV), and herpesviruses, such as canine herpesvirus (CHV) or a feline herpesvirus (FHV). A "vector" refers to a recombinant DNA or RNA plasmid or virus that comprises a heterologous polynucleotide to be delivered to a target cell, either in vitro or in vivo. The heterologous polynucleotide may comprise a sequence of interest for purposes of therapy, and may optionally be in the form of an expression cassette. As used herein, a vector needs not be capable of replication in the ultimate target cell or subject. The term includes cloning vectors also included are viral vectors. The term "recombinant" means a polynucleotide semisynthetic, or synthetic origin which either does not occur in nature or is linked to another polynucleotide in an arrangement not found in nature.<br>
"Heterologous" means derived from a genetically distinct entity from the rest of the entity to which it is being compared. For example, a polynucleotide, may be placed by genetic engineering techniques into a plasmid or vector derived from a different source, and is a heterologous polynucleotide. A promoter removed from its native coding sequence and operatively linked to a coding sequence other than the native sequence is a heterologous promoter.<br>
The polynucleotides of the invention may comprise additional sequences, such as additional encoding sequences within the same transcription unit, controlling elements such as promoters, ribosome binding sites, polyadenylation sites, additional transcription units under control of the same or a different promoter, sequences that permit cloning, expression, homologous recombination, and transformation of a host cell, and any such construct as may be desirable to provide embodiments of this invention.<br>
Elements for the expression of an influenza antigen, epitope or immunogen are advantageously present in an inventive vector. In minimum manner, this<br>
comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of an initiation codon (ATG), a stop codon and a promoter, and optionally also a polyadenylation sequence for certain vectors such as plasmid and certain viral vectors, e.g., viral vectors other than poxviruses. When the polynucleotide encodes a polyprotein fragment, e.g. an influenza peptide, advantageously, in the vector, an ATG is placed at 5' of the reading frame and a stop codon is placed at 3'. Other elements for controlling expression may be present, such as enhancer sequences, stabilizing sequences, such as intron and signal sequences permitting the secretion of the protein. Methods for making and/or administering a vector or recombinants or plasmid for expression of gene products of genes of the invention either in vivo or in vitro can be any desired method, e.g., a method which is by or analogous to the methods disclosed in, or disclosed in documents cited in: U.S. Patent Nos. 4,603,112; 4,769,330; 4,394,448; 4,722,848; 4,745,051; 4,769,331; 4,945,050; 5,494,807; 5,514,375; 5,744,140; 5,744,141; 5,756,103; 5,762,938; 5,766,599; 5,990,091; 5,174,993; 5,505,941; 5,338,683; 5,494,807; 5,591,639; 5,589,466; 5,677,178; 5,591,439; 5,552,143; 5,580,859; 6,130,066; 6,004,777; 6,130,066; 6,497,883; 6,464,984; 6,451,770; 6,391,314; 6,387,376; 6,376,473; 6,368,603; 6,348,196; 6,306,400; 6,228,846; 6,221,362; 6,217,883; 6,207,166; 6,207,165; 6,159,477; 6,153,199; 6,090,393; 6,074,649; 6,045,803; 6,033,670; 6,485,729; 6,103,526; 6,224,882; 6,312,682; 6,348,450 and 6; 312,683; U.S. patent application Serial No. 920,197, filed October 16,1986; WO 90/01543; W091/11525; WO 94/16716; WO 96/39491; WO 98/33510; EP 265785; EP 0 370 573; Andreansky et al., Proc.

Thus, the vector in the invention can be any suitable recombinant virus or virus vector, such as a poxvirus (e.g., vaccinia virus, avipox virus, canarypox virus, fowlpox virus, raccoonpox virus, swinepox virus, etc.), adenovirus (e.g., human adenovirus, canine adenovirus), herpesvirus (e.g. canine herpesvirus), baculovirus, retrovirus, etc. (as in documents incorporated herein by reference); or the vector can be a plasmid. The herein cited and incorporated herein by reference documents, in addition to providing examples of vectors useful in the practice of the invention, can also provide sources for non-influenza peptides or fragments thereof to be expressed by vector or vectors in, or included in, the compositions of the invention.<br>
The present invention also relates to preparations comprising vectors, such as expression vectors, e.g., therapeutic compositions. The preparations can comprise, consist essentially of, or consist of one or more vectors, e.g., expression vectors, such as in vivo expression vectors, comprising, consisting essentially or consisting of (and advantageously expressing) one or more of influenza antigens, epitopes or immunogens. Advantageously, the vector contains and expresses a polynucleotide that includes, consists essentially of, or consists of a polynucleotide coding for (and advantageously expressing) an influenza antigen, epitope or immunogen, in a pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable carrier, excipient or vehicle. Thus, according to an embodiment of the invention, the other vector or vectors in the preparation comprises, consists essentially of or consists of a polynucleotide that encodes, and under appropriate circumstances the vector expresses one or more other proteins of an influenza antigen, epitope or immunogen (e.g., hemagglutinin, neuraminidase, nucleoprotein) or a fragment thereof.<br>
According to another embodiment, the vector or vectors in the preparation comprise, or consist essentially of, or consist of polynucleotide(s) encoding one or more proteins or fragment(s) thereof of an influenza antigen, epitope or<br>
immunogen, the vector or vectors expressingthe polynucleotide(s). The inventive preparation advantageously comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of, at least two vectors comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of, and advantageously also expressing, advantageously in vivo under appropriate conditions or suitable conditions or in a suitable host cell, polynucleotides from different canine influenza isolates encoding the same proteins and/or for different proteins, but advantageously the same proteins. Preparations containing one or more vectors containing, consisting essentially of or consisting of polynucleotides encoding, and advantageously expressing, advantageously in vivo, an influenza antigen, fusion protein or an epitope thereof. The invention is also directed at mixtures of vectors that contain, consist essentially of, or consist of coding for, and express, different influenza antigens, epitopes or immunogens, e.g., an influenza antigen, epitope or immunogen from different species such as, but not limited to, humans,, pigs, , in addition to avian species including chicken, ducks and geese.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, the expression vector is a viral vector, in particular an in vivo expression vector. In an advantageous embodiment, the expression vector is an adenovirus vector. Advantageously, the adenovirus is a human Ad5 vector, an El-deleted and/ or an E3-deleted adenovirus.<br>
In one particular embodiment the viral vector is a poxvirus, e.g. a vaccinia virus or an attenuated vaccinia virus, (for instance, MVA, a modified Ankara strain obtained after more than 570 passages of the Ankara vaccine strain on chicken embryo fibroblasts; see Stickl &amp; Hochstein-Mintzel, Munch. Med. Wschr., 1971, 113, 1149-1153; Sutter et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 1992, 89, 10847-10851; available as ATCC VR-1508; or NYVAC, see U.S. Patent No. 5,494,807, for instance, Examples 1 to 6 and et seq of U.S. Patent No. 5,494,807 which discuss the construction of NYVAC, as well as variations of NYVAC with additional ORFs deleted from the Copenhagen strain vaccinia virus genome, as well as the insertion of heterologous coding nucleic acid molecules into sites of this recombinant, and also, the use of matched promoters; see also W096/40241),<br>
an avipox virus or an attenuated avipox virus (e.g., canarypox, fowlpox, dovepox, pigeonpox, quailpox, ALVAC or TROVAC; see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,505,941, 5,494,807), swinepox, raccoonpox, camelpox, or myxomatosis virus. According to another embodiment of the invention, the poxvirus vector is a canarypox virus or a fowlpox virus vector, advantageously an attenuated canarypox virus or fowlpox virus. In this regard, is made to the canarypox available from the ATCC under access number VR-111. Attenuated canarypox viruses are described in U.S. Patent No. 5,756,103 (ALVAC) and WO01/05934. Numerous fowlpox virus vaccination strains are also available, e.g. the DIFTOSEC CT strain marketed by MERIAL and the NOBILIS VARIOLE vaccine marketed by INTERVET; and, reference is also made to U.S. Patent No. 5,766,599 which pertains to the atenuated fowlpox strain TROVAC. For information on the method to generate recombinants thereof and how to administer recombinants thereof, the skilled artisan can refer documents cited herein and to WO90/12882, e.g., as to vaccinia virus mention is made of U.S. Patents Nos. 4,769,330, 4,722,848, 4,603,112, 5,110,587, 5,494,807, and 5,762,938 inter alia; as to fowlpox, mention is made of U.S. Patents Nos. 5,174,993, 5,505,941 and US-5,766,599 inter alia; as to canarypox mentionis made of U.S. Patent No. 5,756,103 inter alia; as to swinepox mention is made of U.S. Patent No. 5,382,425 inter alia; and, as to raccoonpox, mention is made of WOOO/03030 inter alia. When the expression vector is a vaccinia virus, insertion site or sites for the polynucleotide or polynucleotides to be expressed are advantageously at the thymidine kinase (TK) gene or insertion site, the hemagglutinin (HA) gene or insertion site, the region encoding the inclusion body of the A type (ATI); see also documents cited herein, especially those pertaining to vaccinia virus. In the case of canarypox, advantageously the insertion site or sites are ORF(s) C3, C5 and/or C6; see also documents cited herein, especially those pertaining to canarypox virus. In the case of fowlpox, advantageously the insertion site or sites are ORFs F7 and/or F8; see also documents cited herein, especially those pertaining to fowlpox virus. The insertion site or sites for MVA virus area advantageously as in various publications, including Carroll M. W. et<br>
al., Vaccine, 1997, 15 (4), 387-394; Stittelaar K. J. et al., J. Virol., 2000, 74 (9), 4236-4243; Sutter G. et al., 1994, Vaccine, 12 (11), 1032-1040; and, in this regard it is also noted that the complete MVA genome is described in Antoine G., Virology, 1998, 244, 365-396, which enables the skilled artisan to use other insertion sites or other promoters.<br>
Advantageously, the polynucleotide to be expressed is inserted under the control of a specific poxvirus promoter, e.g., the vaccinia promoter 7.5 kDa (Cochran et al., J. Virology, 1985, 54, 30-35), the vaccinia promoter I3L (Riviere et al., J. Virology, 1992, 66, 3424-3434), the vaccinia promoter HA (Shida, Virology, 1986, 150, 451-457), the cowpox promoter ATI (Funahashi et al., J. Gen. Virol.,<br>
1988,	69, 35-47), the vaccinia promoter H6 (Taylor J. et al., Vaccine, 1988, 6,<br>
504-508; Guo P. et al. J. Virol., 1989, 63, 4189-4198; Perkus M. et al., J. Virol.,<br>
1989,	63, 3829-3836), inter alia.<br>
In a particular embodiment the viral vector is an adenovirus, such as a human adenovirus (HAV) or a canine adenovirus (CAV).<br>
In one embodiment the viral vector is a human adenovirus, in particular a serotype 5 adenovirus, rendered incompetent for replication by a deletion in the El region of the viral genome, in particular from about nucleotide 459 to about nucleotide 3510 by reference to the sequence of the hAd5 disclosed in Genbank under the accession number M73260 and in the referenced publication J. Chroboczek et al Virol. 1992, 186, 280-285. The deleted adenovirus is propagated in El-expressing 293 (F. Graham et al J. Gen. Virol. 1977, 36, 59-72) or PER cells, in particular PER.C6 (F. Falloux et al Human Gene Therapy 1998, 9, 1909-1917). The human adenovirus can be deleted in the E3 region, in particular from about nucleotide 28592 to about nucleotide 30470. The deletion in the El region can be done in combination with a deletion in the E3 region (see, e.g. J. Shriver et al. Nature, 2002, 415, 331-335, F. Graham et al Methods in Molecular Biology Vol .7: Gene Transfer and Expression Protocols Edited by E. Murray, The Human Press Inc, 1991, p 109-128; Y. Ilan et al Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1997, 94, 2587-2592; US6,133,028; US6,692,956; S. Tripathy et al Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1994, 91, 11557-11561; B. Tapnell Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev.1993, 12, 185-199;X. Danthinne<br>
et al Gene Thrapy 2000, 7, 1707-1714; K. Berkner Bio Techniques 1988, 6, 616-629; K. Berkner et al Nucl. Acid Res. 1983, 11, 6003-6020; C. Chavier et al J. Virol. 1996, 70, 4805-4810). The insertion sites can be the El and/or E3 loci (region) eventually after a partial or complete deletion of the El and/or E3 regions. Advantageously, when the expression vector is an adenovirus, the polynucleotide to be expressed is inserted under the control of a promoter functional in eukaryotic cells, such as a strong promoter, preferably a cytomegalovirus immediate:early gene promoter (CMV-IE promoter), in particular the enhancer / promoter region from about nucleotide -734 to about nucleotide +7 in M. Boshart et al Cell 1985, 41, 521-530 or the enhancer / promoter region from the pCI vector from Promega Corp. The CMV-IE promoter is advantageously of murine or human origin. The promoter of the elongation factor la can also be used. A muscle specific promoter can also be used (X. Li et al Nat. Biotechnol. 1999, 17, 241-245). Strong promoters are also discussed herein in relation to plasmid vectors. In one embodiment, a splicing sequence can be located downstream of the enhancer / promoter region. For example, the intron 1 isolated from the CMV-IE gene (R. Stenberg et al J. Virol. 1984, 49, 190), the intron isolated from the rabbit or human p-globin gene, in particular the intron 2 from the b-globin gene, the intron isolated from the immunoglobulin gene, a splicing sequence from the SV40 early gene or the chimeric intron sequence isolated from the pCI vector from Promege Corp. comprising the human P-globin gene donor sequence fused to the mouse immunoglobulin acceptor sequence (from about nucleotide 890 to about nucleotide 1022 in Genbank under the accession number CVU47120). A poly(A) sequence and terminator sequence can be inserted downstream the polynucleotide to be expressed, e.g. a bovine growth hormone gene, in particular from about nucleotide 2339 to about nucleotide 2550 in Genbank under the accession number BOVGHRH, a rabbit P-globin gene or a SV40 late gene polyadenylation signal.<br>
In another embodiment the viral vector is a canine adenovirus, in particular a CAV-2 (see, e.g. L. Fischer et al. Vaccine, 2002, 20, 3485-3497; U.S. Patent No. 5,529,780; U.S. Patent No. 5,688,920; PCT Application No. WO95/14102). For<br>
CAV, the insertion sites can be in the E3 region and /or in the region located between the E4 region and the right ITR region (see U.S. Patent No. 6,090,393; U.S. Patent No. 6,156,567). In one embodiment the insert is under the control of a promoter, such as a cytomegalovirus immediate-early gene promoter (CMV-IE promoter) or a promoter already described for a human adenovirus vector. A poly(A) sequence and terminator sequence can be inserted downstream the polynucleotide to be expressed, e.g. a bovine growth hormone gene or a rabbit P-globin gene polyadenylation signal.<br>
In another particular embodiment the viral vector is a herpesvirus such as a canine herpesvirus (CHV) or a feline herpesvirus (FHV). For CHV, the insertion sites may be in particular in the thymidine kinase gene, in the ORF3, or in the UL43 ORF (see U.S. Patent No. 6,159,477). In one embodiment the polynucleotide to be expressed is inserted under the control of a promoter functional in eukaryotic cells, advantageously a CMV-IE promoter (murine or human).. A poly(A) sequence and terminator sequence can be inserted downstream the polynucleotide to be expressed, e.g. bovine growth hormone or a rabbit p-globin gene polyadenylation signal.<br>
According to a yet further embodiment of the invention, the expression vector is a plasmid vector or a DNA plasmid vector, in particular an in vivo expression vector. In a specific, non-limiting example, the pVR1020 or 1012 plasmid (VICAL Inc.; Luke C. et al., Journal of Infectious Diseases, 1997, 175, 91-97; Hartikka J. et al., Human Gene Therapy, 1996, 7, 1205-1217, see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,846,946 and 6,451,769) can be utilized as a vector for the insertion of a polynucleotide sequence. The pVR1020 plasmid is derived from pVR1012 and contains the human tPA signal sequence. In one embodiment the human tPA signal comprises from amino acid M(l) to amino acid S(23) in Genbank under the accession number HUMTPA14. In another specific, non-limiting example, the plasmid utilized as a vector for the insertion of a polynucleotide sequence can contain the signal peptide sequence of equine IGF1 from amino acid M(24) to amino acid A(48) in Genbank under the accession number U28070. Additional information on DNA plasmids which may be consulted or employed in the<br>
practice are found, for example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,852,705; 6,818,628; 6,586,412; 6,576,243; 6,558,674; 6,464,984; 6,451,770; 6,376,473 and 6,221,362. The term plasmid covers any DNA transcription unit comprising a polynucleotide according to the invention and the elements necessary for its in vivo expression in a cell or cells of the desired host or target; and, in this regard, it is noted that a supercoiled or non-supercoiled, circular plasmid, as well as a linear form, are intended to be within the scope of the invention.<br>
Each plasmid comprises or contains or consists essentially of, in addition to the polynucleotide encoding an influenza antigen, epitope or immunogen, optionally fused with a heterologous peptide sequence, variant, analog or fragment, operably linked to a promoter or under the control of a promoter or dependent upon a promoter. In general, it is advantageous to employ a strong promoter functional in eukaryotic cells. The preferred strong promoter is the immediate early cytomegalovirus promoter (CMV-IE) of human or murine origin, or optionally having another origin such as the rat or guinea pig. The CMV-IE promoter can comprise the actual promoter part, which may or may not be associated with the enhancer part. Reference can be made to EP-A-260 148, EP-A-323 597, U.S. Patents Nos. 5,168,062, 5,385,839, and 4,968,615, as well as to PCT Application No WO87/03905. The CMV-IE promoter is advantageously a human CMV-IE (Boshart M. et al., Cell., 1985, 41, 521-530) or murine CMV-IE. In more general terms, the promoter has either a viral or a cellular origin. A strong viral promoter other than CMV-IE that may be usefully employed in the practice of the invention is the early/late promoter of the SV40 virus or the LTR promoter of the Rous sarcoma virus. A strong cellular promoter that may be usefully employed in the practice of the invention is the promoter of a gene of the cytoskeleton, such as e.g. the desmin promoter (Kwissa M. et al., Vaccine, 2000, 18, 2337-2344), or the actin promoter (Miyazaki J. et al., Gene, 1989, 79, 269-277).<br>
Functional sub fragments of these promoters, i.e., portions of these promoters that maintain an adequate promoting activity, are included within the present invention, e.g. truncated CMV-IE promoters according to PCT Application No.<br><br>
W098/00166 or U.S. Patent No. 6,156,567 can be used in the practice of the invention. A promoter in the practice of the invention consequently includes derivatives and sub fragments of a full-length promoter that maintain an adequate promoting activity and hence function as a promoter, preferably promoting activity substantially similar to that of the actual or full-length promoter from which the derivative or sub fragment is derived, e.g., akin to the activity of the truncated CMV-IE promoters of U.S. Patent No. 6,156,567 to the activity of full-length CMV-IE promoters. Thus, a CMV-IE promoter in the practice of the invention can comprise or consist essentially of or consist of the promoter portion of the full-length promoter and/or the enhancer portion of the full-length promoter, as well as derivatives and sub fragments.<br>
Preferably, the plasmids comprise or consist essentially of other expression control elements. It is particularly advantageous to incorporate stabilizing sequence(s), e.g., intron sequence(s), preferably the first intron of the hCMV-IE (PCT Application No. WO89/01036), the intron II of the rabbit p-globin gene (van Ooyen et al., Science, 1979, 206, 337-344).<br>
As to the polyadenylation signal (polyA) for the plasmids and viral vectors other than poxviruses, use can more be made of the poly(A) signal of the bovine growth hormone (bGH) gene (see U.S. Patent No. 5,122,458), or the poly(A) signal of the rabbit P-globin gene or the poly(A) signal of the SV40 virus. According to another embodiment of the invention, the expression vectors are expression vectors used for the in vitro expression of proteins in an appropriate cell system. The expressed proteins can be harvested in or from the culture supernatant after, or not after secretion (if there is no secretion a cell lysis typically occurs or is performed), optionally concentrated by concentration methods such as ultraflltration and/or purified by purification means, such as affinity, ion exchange or gel filtration-type chromatography methods. A "host cell" denotes a prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell that has been genetically altered, or is capable of being genetically altered by administration of an exogenous polynucleotide, such as a recombinant plasmid or vector. When referring to genetically altered cells, the term refers both to the originally altered<br>
cell and to the progeny thereof. Advantageous host cells include, but are not limited to, baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, colon carcinoma (Caco-2) cells, COS7 cells, MCF-7 cells, MCF-10A cells, Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) lines, mink lung (Mv1Lu) cells, MRC-5 cells, U937 cells and VERO cells. Polynucleotides comprising a desired sequence can be inserted into a suitable cloning or expression vector, and the vector in turn can be introduced into a suitable host cell for replication and amplification. Polynucleotides can be introduced into host cells by any means known in the art. The vectors containing the polynucleotides of interest can be introduced into the host cell by any of a number of appropriate means, including direct uptake, endocytosis, transfection, f-mating, electroporation, transfection employing calcium chloride, rubidium chloride, calcium phosphate, DEAE-dextran, or other substances; microprojectile bombardment; lipofection; and infection (where the vector is infectious, for instance, a retroviral vector). The choice of introducing vectors or polynucleotides will often depend on features of the host cell. In an advantageous embodiment, the invention provides for the administration of a therapeutically effective amount of a formulation for the delivery and expression of an influenza antigen, epitope or immunogen in a target cell. Determination of the therapeutically effective amount is routine experimentation for one of ordinary skill in the art. In one embodiment, the formulation comprises an expression vector comprising a polynucleotide that expresses an influenza antigen, epitope or immunogen and a pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable carrier, vehicle or excipient. In an advantageous embodiment, the pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable carrier, vehicle or excipient facilitates transfection and/or improves preservation of the vector or protein.<br>
The pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable carriers or vehicles or excipients are well known to the one skilled in the art. For example, a pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable carrier or vehicle or excipient can be a 0.9% NaCl (e.g., saline) solution or a phosphate buffer. Other pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable carrier or vehicle or excipients that can be used for methods of this invention include, but are not limited to, poly-(L-glutamate) or<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone. The pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable carrier or vehicle or excipients may be any compound or combination of compounds facilitating the administration of the vector (or protein expressed from an inventive vector in vitro); advantageously, the carrier, vehicle or excipient may facilitate transfection and/or improve preservation of the vector (or protein). Doses and dose volumes are herein discussed in the general description and can also be determined by the skilled artisan from this disclosure read in conjunction with the knowledge in the art, without any undue experimentation. The cationic lipids containing a quaternary ammonium salt which are advantageously but not exclusively suitable for plasmids, are advantageously those having the following formula:  (Formula Removed)<br>
in which RI is a saturated or unsaturated straight-chain aliphatic radical having 12 to 18 carbon atoms, RI is another aliphatic radical containing 2 or 3 carbon atoms and X is an amine or hydroxyl group, e.g. the DMRIE. In another embodiment the cationic lipid can be associated with a neutral lipid, e.g. the DOPE. Among these cationic lipids, preference is given to DMRIE (N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-N,N-dimethyl-2,3-bis(tetradecyloxy)-1-propane ammonium; WO96/34109), advantageously associated with a neutral lipid, advantageously DOPE (dioleoyl-phosphatidyl-ethanol amine; Behr J. P., 1994, Bioconjugate Chemistry, 5, 382-389), to form DMRIE-DOPE.<br>
Advantageously, the plasmid mixture with the adjuvant is formed extemporaneously and advantageously contemporaneously with administration of the preparation or shortly before administration of the preparation; for instance, shortly before or prior to administration, the plasmid-adjuvant mixture is formed, advantageously so as to give enough time prior to administration for the mixture to form a complex, e.g. between about 10 and about 60 minutes prior to administration, such as approximately 30 minutes prior to administration.<br>
When DOPE is present, the DMRIE:DOPE molar ratio is advantageously about 95: about 5 to about 5:about 95, more advantageously about 1: about 1, e.g., 1:1. The DMRIE or DMRIE-DOPE adjuvant:plasmid weight ratio can be between about 50: about 1 and about 1: about 10, such as about 10: about 1 and about 1:about 5, and advantageously about 1: about 1 and about 1: about 2, e.g., 1:1 and 1:2.<br>
The invention also provides for inactivated canine influenza vaccines. As used herein, the term "inactivated vaccine" means a vaccine composition containing an infectious organism or pathogen that is no longer capable of replication or growth. Inactivation may be accomplished by a variety of methods sufficient to prevent replication or growth of the organism while maintaining its immunogenicity. The inactivated vaccine may be an inactivated form of an isolate of an influenza virus from an affected dog. The virus may be isolated from the alveoli or lung of an affected dog. In another embodiment, the inactivated vaccine may be an inactivated equine influenza. In an advantageous embodiment, the equine influenza is a Kentucky or Newmarket equine influenza. The inactivated vaccine may be an inactivated version of any one of the influenza strains described above. An inactivated vaccine may be prepared as well from the harvested culture fluid. The virus may be produced either by inoculation of 10-11-day embryonated eggs (J. Violay et al US6,048,537) or by inoculation of BHK-21 cell culture (C. Ross et al Archiv. Fur die gesamte Virusforschung 1970, 30, 82-88; T. Tolstova et al Acta Virol. 1966, 10, 315-321; Ho. Merten et al Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996, 397, 141-151), of MDCK cell culture (J. Tree et al Vaccine 2001, 19, 3444-3450; Y. Ghendon et al Vaccine 2005, 23, 4678-4684; R. Brands et al Dev. Biol. Stand. 1999, 98, 93-100; R. Youil et al J Virol. Methods 2004, 120, 23-31), of Vero cell culture (O. Kistner et al Vaccine 1998, 16, 960-968; E. Govorkova et al J. Virol. 1996, 70, 5519-5524). The allantoic fluid or the cell culture supernatant can be clarified by low centrifugation and/or filtration. The virus can be concentrated by ultrafiltration and can be purified by zonal centrifugation on sucrose gradient (J. Violay et al US6,048,537; 0. Kistner et al idem), by gel filtration (D. Nayak et al<br>
J. Chromatogr. B Analyt. Technol. Biomed. Life Sci. 2005, 823, 75-81; S. Tomita et al Kitasato Arch. Exp. Med. 1971,44,185-196).<br>
Inactivation may be achieved by treating the viruses by any of the methods commonly employed to make inactivated vaccines. These methods include but are not limited to formaldehyde treatment (O. Kistner et al idem; A. Garcia et al Avian Diseases 1998, 42, 248-256), betapropriolactone treatment (B. Bdowsky et al Vaccine 1991, 9, 398-402 and Vaccine 1993, 11, 343-348; N. Keverin et al Arch. Virol. 2000, 145, 1059-1066), ethylene-imine treatment (D. Swayne et al Avian Diseases 2001, 45, 355-365), treatment with organic solvents, treatment with detergents, treatment with Tween-ether or treatment with Triton X-100 (J. Vilay et al idem) for allantoic fluid . For the inactivation the concentration can be about 0.01-0.2 % w/v for the formaldehyde; about 0.03-0.2 % w/v for the betapropiolactone; about 0.5-20 mM for ethyleneimine. The methods recited herein serve as art-known examples for inactivating virus. Inactivated virus vaccines are usually administered mixed with an adjuvant. The inactivated vaccine can be administered to the animal by any of a plurality of methods which include but are not limited to inoculation intramuscularly or subcutaneously, spraying, ocularly, nasally, orally, or in ovo.<br>
The immunogenic compositions and vaccines according to the invention may comprise or consist essentially of one or more adjuvants. Suitable adjuvants for use in the practice of the present invention are (1) polymers of acrylic or methacrylic acid, maleic anhydride and alkenyl derivative polymers, (2) immunostimulating sequences (ISS), such as oligodeoxyribonucleotide sequences having one ore more non-methylated CpG units (Klinman et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, 1996, 93, 2879-2883; WO98/16247), (3) an oil in water emulsion, such as the SPT emulsion described on p 147 of "Vaccine Design, The Subunit and Adjuvant Approach" published by M. Powell, M. Newman, Plenum Press 1995, and the emulsion MF59 described on p 183 of the same work, (4) cation lipids containing a quaternary ammonium salt, e.g., DDA (5) cytokines, (6) aluminum hydroxide or aluminum phosphate, (7) saponin or (8) other adjuvants<br>
discussed in any document cited and incorporated by reference into the instant application, or (9) any combinations or mixtures thereof.<br>
The oil in water emulsion (3), which is especially appropriate for viral vectors, can be based on: light liquid paraffin oil (European pharmacopoeia type), isoprenoid oil such as squalane, squalene, oil resulting from the oligomerization of alkenes, e.g. isobutene or decene, esters of acids or alcohols having a straight-chain alkyl group, such as vegetable oils, ethyl oleate, propylene glycol, di(caprylate/caprate), glycerol tri(caprylate/caprate) and propylene glycol dioleate, or esters of branched, fatty alcohols or acids, especially isostearic acid esters. The oil is used in combination with emulsifiers to form an emulsion. The emulsifiers may be nonionic surfactants, such as: esters of on the one hand sorbitan, mannide (e.g. anhydromannitol oleate), glycerol, polyglycerol or propylene glycol and on the other hand oleic, isostearic, ricinoleic or hydroxystearic acids, said esters being optionally ethoxylated, or polyoxypropylene-polyoxyethylene copolymer blocks, such as Pluronic, e.g., L121.<br>
Among the type (1) adjuvant polymers, preference is given to polymers of crosslinked acrylic or methacrylic acid, especially crosslinked by polyalkenyl ethers of sugars or polyalcohols. These compounds are known under the name carbomer (Pharmeuropa, vol. 8, no. 2, June 1996). One skilled in the art can also refer to U.S. Patent No. 2,909,462, which provides such acrylic polymers crosslinked by a polyhydroxyl compound having at least three hydroxyl groups, preferably no more than eight such groups, the hydrogen atoms of at least three hydroxyl groups being replaced by unsaturated, aliphatic radicals having at least two carbon atoms. The preferred radicals are those containing 2 to 4 carbon atoms, e.g. vinyls, allyls and other ethylenically unsaturated groups. The unsaturated radicals can also contain other substituents, such as methyl. Products sold under the name Carbopol (BF Goodrich, Ohio, USA) are especially suitable. They are crosslinked by allyl saccharose or by allyl pentaerythritol. Among them, reference is made to Carbopol 974P, 934P and 971P.<br>
As to the maleic anhydride-alkenyl derivative copolymers, preference is given to EMA (Monsanto), which are straight-chain or crosslinked ethylene-maleic anhydride copolymers and they are, for example, crosslinked by divinyl ether. Reference is also made to J. Fields et al., Nature 186: 778-780, June 4, 1960. With regard to structure, the acrylic or memacrylic acid polymers and EMA are preferably formed by basic units having the following formula: <br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which:<br>
RI and R2, which can be the same or different, represent H or CH3<br>
x = 0 or 1, preferably x = 1<br>
y = 1 or 2, with x + y = 2.<br>
For EMA, x = 0 and y = 2 and for carbomers x = y = 1.<br>
These polymers are soluble in water or physiological salt solution (20 g/1 NaCl) and the pH can be adjusted to 7.3 to 7.4, e.g., by soda (NaOH), to provide the adjuvant solution in which the expression vector(s) can be incorporated. The polymer concentration in the final vaccine composition can range between 0.01 and 1.5% w/v, advantageously 0.05 to 1% w/v and preferably 0.1 to 0.4% w/v. The cytokine or cytokines (5) can be in protein form in the immunogenic or vaccine composition, or can be co-expressed in the host with the immunogen or immunogens or epitope(s) thereof. Preference is given to the co-expression of the cytokine or cytokines, either by the same vector as that expressing the immunogen or immunogens or epitope(s) thereof, or by a separate vector therefor. The invention comprehends preparing such combination compositions; for instance by admixing the active components, advantageously together and with an adjuvant, carrier, cytokine, and/or diluent.<br>
Cytokines that may be used in the present invention include, but are not limited to, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interferon a (IFN α), interferon ß (IFN ß),<br><br>
interferony, (IFNy), interleukin-1α(IL-l α), interleukin-1 ß (IL-1 ß), interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-3 (IL-3), interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-5 (IL-5), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-7 (IL-7), interleukin-8 (IL-8), interleukin-9 (IL-9), interleukin-10 (IL-10), interleukin-11 (IL-11), interleukin-12 (IL-12), tumor necrosis factor a (TNF a), tumor necrosis factor p (TNF ß), and transforming growth factor p (TGF P). It is understood that cytokines can be co-administered and/or sequentially administered with the immunogenic or vaccine composition of the present invention. Thus, for instance, the vaccine of the instant invention can also contain an exogenous nucleic acid molecule that expresses in vivo a suitable cytokine, e.g., a cytokine matched to this host to be vaccinated or in which an immunological response is to be elicited (for instance, a canine cytokine for preparations to be administered to dogs).<br>
Advantageously, the pharmaceutical and/or therapeutic compositions and/or formulations according to the invention comprise or consist essentially of or consist of an effective quantity to elicit a therapeutic response of one or more expression vectors and/or polypeptides as discussed herein; and, an effective quantity can be determined from this disclosure, including the documents incorporated herein, and the knowledge in the art, without undue experimentation. In the case of therapeutic and/or pharmaceutical compositions based on a plasmid vector, a dose can comprise, consist essentially of or consist of, in general terms, about in 1 µg to about 2000 µg, advantageously about 50 µg to about 1000 µg and more advantageously from about 100 µg to about 800 µg of plasmid expressing the influenza antigen, epitope or immunogen. When the therapeutic and/or pharmaceutical compositions based on a plasmid vector is administered with electroporation the dose of plasmid is generally between about 0.1 µg and Img, advantageously between about 1 µg and 100 µg, advantageously between about 2 ug and 50 µg. The dose volumes can be between about 0.1 and about 2 ml, advantageously between about 0.2 and about 1 ml. These doses and dose volumes are suitable for the treatment of canines and other mammalian target species such as equines and felines.<br>
The therapeutic and/or pharmaceutical composition contains per dose from about 104 to about 1011, advantageously from about 105 to about 1010 and more advantageously from about 106 to about 109 viral particles of recombinant adenovirus expressing an influenza antigen, epitope or immunogen. In the case of therapeutic and/or pharmaceutical compositions based on a poxvirus, a dose can be between about 102 pfu and about 109 pfu. The pharmaceutical composition contains per dose from about 105 to 109, advantageously from about 106 to 108 pfu of poxvirus or herpesvirus recombinant expressing the influenza antigen, epitope or immunogen.<br>
The dose volume of compositions for target species that are mammals, e.g., the dose volume of canine compositions, based on viral vectors, e.g., non-poxvirus-viral-vector-based compositions, is generally between about 0.1 to about 2.0 ml, preferably between about 0.1 to about 1.0 ml, and more preferably between about 0.5 ml to about 1.0ml.<br>
With inactivated compositions of the virus or organism or pathogen produced on the new cell culture, the animal may be administered approximately 104-109 equivalent CCID50 (liter before inactivation), advantageously approximately 105-<br>
10 equivalent CCID50 in a single dosage unit. The volume of one single dosage unit can be between 0.2 ml and 5.0 ml and advantageously between 0.5 ml and 2.0 ml and more advantageously about 2.0 ml. One or more administrations can be done; e.g. with two injections at 2-4 weeks interval, and advantageously with a boost about 3 weeks after the first injection.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment, an animal, advantageously a dog, is vaccinated with two doses of inactivated vaccine at about 3 to 4 week intervals via the subcutaneous route, although an intramuscular route is also contemplated. Blood samples may be collected on the day of the first and/or second vaccination and about 2 to 4 weeks after the second vaccination to determine the levels of anti-influenza virus specific antibodies by methods known to one of skill in the art, for example, virus neutralization, hemagglutination inhibition, ELISA or single radial heamolysis (SRH) tests.<br>
The efficacy of the inactivated vaccines may be tested about 2 to 4 weeks after the second immunization by challenging animals, advantageously dogs, with a virulent strain of influenza, advantageously the influenza H3N8 strain. The animal may be challenged by spray, intra-nasally, intra-tracheally and/or orally. The challenge viral may be about 105-8 BID 50 in a volume depending upon the route of administration. For example, if the administration is by spray, a virus suspension is aerosolized to generate about 1 to 100 um droplets, if the administration is intra-nasal, intra-tracheal or oral, the volume of the challenge virus is about 0.5 ml, 1-2 ml and 5-10 ml, respectively. Animals may be observed daily for 14 days following challenge for clinical signs, for example, fever, cough, nasal, ocular discharge, respiratory distress, anorexia and lethargy. In addition, groups of animals may be euthanized and evaluated for pathological findings of pulmonary and pleural hemorrhage, tracheitis, bronchitis, broncholilitis, and bronchopneumonia. Tracheal swabs may be collected from all animals post challenge days 1-14 for virus isolation. The presence or absence of viral antigens in respiratory tissues may be evaluated by immunohistochemistry, for example, on days 3, 7 and 10 post-challenge. Blood samples may be collected post-challenge (e.g., on days 7 and 14 post-challenge) and may be analyzed for the presence of anti-influenza H3N8 virus specific antibody.<br>
It should be understood by one of skill in the art that the disclosure herein is provided by way of example and the present invention is not limited thereto. From the disclosure herein and the knowledge in the art, the skilled artisan can determine the number of administrations, the administration route, and the doses to be used for each injection protocol, without any undue experimentation. The present invention contemplates at least one administration to an animal of an efficient amount of the therapeutic composition made according to the invention. The animal may be male, female, pregnant female and newborn. This administration may be via various routes including, but not limited to, intramuscular (IM), intradermal (ID) or subcutaneous (SC) injection or via intranasal or oral administration. The therapeutic composition according to the invention can also be administered by a needleless apparatus (as, for example with<br>
a Pigjet, Biqjector or Vitajet apparatus (Bioject, Oregon, USA)). Another approach to administer plasmid compositions is to use electroporation (see, e.g. S. Tollefsen et al. Vaccine, 2002, 20, 3370-3378; S. Tollefsen et al. Scand. J. Immunol., 2003, 57, 229-238; S. Babiuk et al., Vaccine, 2002, 20, 3399-3408; PCT Application No. WO99/01158). In another embodiment, the therapeutic composition is delivered to the animal by gene gun or gold particle bombardment. In an advantageous embodiment, the animal is a vertebrate. In a more advantageous embodiment, the vertebrate is a dog.<br>
One embodiment of the invention is a method of eliciting an immune response against influenza in an animal, comprising administering a formulation for delivery and expression of a recombinant poxvirus influenza vaccine or inactivated influenza vaccine in an effective amount for eliciting an immune response. Still another embodiment of the invention is a method of inducing an immunological or protective response against influenza in an animal, comprising administering to the animal an effective amount of a formulation for delivery and expression of an influenza antigen, epitope or immunogen wherein the formulation comprises recombinant poxvirus influenza vaccine or inactivated influenza vaccine and a pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable carrier, vehicle or excipient.<br>
The invention relates to a method to elicit, induce or stimulate the immune response of an animal, advantageously a vertebrate. In one embodiment, the vertebrate is a dog but may also be a cat.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention is a kit for performing a method of inducing an immunological or protective response against influenza in an animal comprising a recombinant influenza poxvirus vaccine or an inactivated influenza vaccine and instructions for performing the method of delivery in an effective amount for eliciting an immune response in the animal.<br>
The invention will now be further described by way of the following non-limiting examples.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Vaccination Of Dogs With Canarypox Expressing H3 Genes<br>
A study was conducted in which dogs were vaccinated dogs on days 0 and 21<br>
with a canarypox expressing H3 genes from Kentucky (CP1529) and Newmarket<br>
(CP1533) equine influenza. The construction of CP1529 and CP1533 is described<br>
in  Examples   1   (c5   locus),   4   and   5   of International   Patent   Publication<br>
W099/44633, the  disclosure of which is  incorporated by reference.     The<br>
nucleotide sequence of the donor plasmids pJT004 and pJTOOS are presented in<br>
FIGS. 1 and 2.<br>
Sera was collected and tested against H3N8 influenza viruses and the other<br>
viruses.   As shown in Table 1, canarypox expressing hemagglutinin H3 genes<br>
induced a substantial amount of antibodies which specifically reacted with H3N8<br>
strains but not with H1N1 or H7N7.   Importantly antibodies were detectable<br>
within two weeks after the first immunization.<br>
Accordingly, a canarypox expressing an influenza HA gene is immunogenic in<br>
dogs.<br>

EXAMPLE 2<br>
Contraction of the donor plasmid pALVAC CS H6p-synthetic ElV H3 HA, pJY1571.1)<br>
The HA gene was derived from equine influenza virus (EIV) H3N8 Ohio 03 strain isolated from a horse in 2003. The HA gene was synthetic with codon optimization for expression in mammlian cells. The ammo acid sequence of EIV Ohio 03 strain HA was compared to that of New Market strain H3 HA and is presented in FIG. 3.<br>
The purpose was the construction of an ALVAC donor plasmid for generation of an ALVAC recombinant expressing codon optimized EIV H3 HA (Ohio 03). The plasmid name was pALVAC C5 H6p-synthetic EIV H3 HA, pJY1571.1. The plasmid backbone is pALVAC C5 H6p. The promoter was a H6 promoter. The description of plasmid construction was as follows and presented schematically in FIG. 4A. The synthetic EIV H3 HA (Ohio 03) was isolated from a plasmid pEIV H3N8 HA by EcoRV/Xhol digestion, and ligated to EcoRV/Xhol digested donor plasmid pALVAC C5 H6p to create pALVAC C5 H6p-Synthetic EIV H3 HA. In the resulting plasmid, there are multiple cloning sites consisting of Xhol, Xba I, Cla I and Sma I between the HA ORF and the T5AT sequence which serves as the transcription termination signal. To bring the HA ORF and the T5AT sequence close together, those cloning sites were then subsequently removed by ligation of re-filled Xhol site with Sma 1 site. The resulting plasmid pJY1571.1 was then sequenced and confirmed to contain the correct sequence. A diagram of the resulting plasmid is presented in FIG. 4B. The predicted amino acid sequence of EIV H3 HA is shown in FIG. 5 A and the nucleotide sequence of arms and insert with translation is shown in FIG. 5B.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Construction of the recombinant canarypox vCP2242<br>
The purpose of this example was the generation and characterization of ALVAC recombinant containing EIV H3N8 codon optimized HA inserted at C5 loci of ALVAC (vCP2242). The parental virus was ALVAC, the donor plasmid was pJY1571.1, the insertion site was a C5 Locus, the promoter was a H6 promoter and cells for in vitro recombination were primary chicken embryo fibroblast cells (1°CEF).<br>
The in vitro recombination (IVR) was performed by transfection of 1°CEF cells with 15 ug of Not I-linearized donor plasmid pJY1571.1. The transfected cells were subsequently infected with ALVAC as rescue virus at MOI of 10. After 24 hr, the transfected-infected cells were harvested, sonicated and used for recombinant virus screening.<br>
Recombinant plaques were screened based on the plaque lift hybridization method using a 821 bp EIV syn HA specific probe labeled with horse radish peroxidase (HRP) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After four sequential rounds of plaque purification, the recombinant designated as vCP2242 was generated and confirmed by hybridization as 100% positive for the EIV syn HA insert and 100% negative for the C5 ORF.<br>
Expression analysis and sequence analysis were performed. Expression analysis was performed by Western blot. Primary CEF cells were infected with vCP2242 stock at MOI of 10 and incubated at 37 C for 26.5 hrs. The cells and culture supernatant were then harvested. Sample proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to Immobilon nylon membrane, and probed with a pool of monoclonal mouse anti-EIV HA antibodies (anti Eq/AK/91: 124-1D9-1, 124-3E3-3, 124-4F3-2 and H3N8 A Eq/miami/63 pool at 1/1,000 dilution). Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antiserum was used as a secondary antibody and the bands were visualized using luminol reagents. vCP2242 showed a protein expression profile with a 80 kDa protein expressed in cell pellet, but not in the culture medium as presented in FIG. 6.<br>
Results of the sequence analysis demonstrated that the sequences of the EIV syn HA and C5L and C5R of ALVAC were correct.<br>

Efficacy of inactivated influenza virus vaccine in canines<br>
Vaccine active ingredient (AI) is produced either in 9-11 day-old embryonated chicken eggs or in continuous cell cultures such as MDCK cells. Egg Production, Harvest and Purification. Vaccine AI production in embryonating chicken eggs is prepared by inoculation 0.1 - 0.25 ml of virus suspension containing 100-1000 EID50 (egg infectious dose) into the allantoic cavity. Allantoic fluid is harvested after incubation at 33-37 °C for 2-6 days and pooled. The virus pool is clarified by centrifugation at 1500 - 4000g for 5-15<br><br>
minutes and filtered through a 20 µm filter (1). The virus maybe concentrated by<br>
ultra-filtration using a 300 KDa membrane with a maximun concentration factor<br>
of 20 (2).<br>
Further the concentrated virus is optionally purified by zonal ultra-centrifugation<br>
on a sucrose gradient followed by filtration of the virus containing fraction<br>
through a 0.5 µm membrane. This step can be repeated. The virus containing<br>
fraction is diluted in a suitable buffer such as a phosphate buffer (3).<br>
Further purification consists of treatment with Tween/ether at 0.1  % final<br>
concentration (w/v)) and 50% final concentration (w/w),  respectively.  The<br>
resulting solution is centrifuged and the aqueous phase is collected. This step can<br>
be repeated. The aqueous phase is treated with nitrogen to remove residual ether<br>
(4).<br>
Cell Culture Production, Harvest and Purification.  Active ingredient is prepared<br>
in cells (e.g. MDCK, BHK, PerC6 cells) by inoculation at a rate of MOI of 0.001-<br>
1 TCID50. Culture is harvested after incubation at 35-37C for 48-96 hrs when<br>
cytopathic effect (CPE) is approximately 50-90%. Culture is sonicated and<br>
centrifuged at 1500-4000g for 5-15 minutes (1). The virus is concentrated by<br>
ultra-filtration using a 300 KD membrane with a max. concentration factor of 20<br>
(2).<br>
The virus is optionally purified by exclusion chromatography (Sepharose 6 fast<br>
flow)(3).<br>
Inactivation.  Virus (fraction 1, 2, 3 or 4) are inactivated by addition of formalin<br>
or beta-propiolactone to a final concentration of 0.05 % (w/v) or 0.01 % (w/v),<br>
respectively and the suspension is held respectively at 5 °C for 16-18 hours or at<br>
20°C for 25-36 hours with continuous agitation.<br>
Active ingredient inactivation is confirmed by inoculation into embryonated<br>
chicken eggs or onto MDCK cells.<br>
Preparation of Final Vaccine. Vaccine consists of the inactivated influenza virus<br>
and an adjuvant such as aluminium hydroxide, aluminum phosphate, Carbomer or<br>
oil-in-water emulsion, which may contain other immunostimulating components<br>
such   as   CpG   (1-100   ug/dose).   Vaccine   typically   contains   15-50   µg   of<br>
hemagglutinin  measured  by  single  radial-immunodiffusion  (SRD)  or  &gt;400<br>
haemagglutination Units<br>
The vaccine is administered either by subcutaneous or intramuscular route. Two<br>
doses are administered at an interval of 2-5 weeks to pups from 4 weeks of age.<br>
Duration of immunity: 6-12 months after a primary vaccination course.<br>
Vaccination/Challenge Protocol.   Dogs (less than 4 weeks old) are vaccinated<br>
with 2 doses of inactivated vaccine at 3-4 weeks interval via the subcutaneous<br>
route. Blood samples are collected on the day of the first and second vaccination<br>
and 2-4 weeks after second vaccination to determine the levels of anti-influenza<br>
virus specific antibodies using virus neutralization, hemagglutination inhibition,<br>
ELISA or Single Radial Heamolysis (SRH) tests.<br>
Two to 4 weeks after 2" immunization dogs are challenged with a virulent strain<br>
of influenza H3N8 to determine efficacy of the vaccines.<br>
Vaccinated and control dogs are challenged by the following route:<br>
By spray:  animals are placed into an enclosed container or a mask is placed on<br>
the nose of the dogs and the virus suspension is aerosolized to generate 1-100 |aM<br>
droplets. Animals are kept in the aerosolization chambers for 30 minutes to allow<br>
inhalation of the aerosol.<br>
Alternativelly thy can be challenged by one the following routes:<br>
Intra-nasallv: 0.5 ml containing 105"8 EID50 of challenge virus is dropped to each<br>
nostril by the aid of dropper.<br>
c o<br>
Intra-tracheally: 1-2 ml containing 10 "  EIDso virus is directly instilled into the trachea.<br>
t    Q<br>
Orally: 5-10 ml containing 10 " EIDSO of challenge virus is orally administered. Animals are observed daily for 14 days following challenge for clinical signs including fever, cough, nasal, ocular discharge, respiratory distress, anorexia and lethargy. In addition, groups of animals are euthanized and evaluated for pathological findings of pulmonary and pleural hemorrhage, tracheitis, bronchitis, broncholilitis, and bronchopneumonia.<br>
Tracheal swabs are collected from all animals post challenge days 1-14 for virus isolation.<br>
Presence or absence of viral antigens in respiratory tissues is evaluated by<br>
immunohistochemistry on days 3, 7 and 10 post-challenge.<br>
Blood samples are collected on days 7 and 14 post-challenge and are analyzed for<br>
the presence of anti-influenza H3N8 virus specific antibody.<br>
