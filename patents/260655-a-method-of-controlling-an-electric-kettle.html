FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a method for controlling electric kettles.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Electric kettles are convenient for human in living and working. However, a simple<br>
process applied for conventional kettles in controlling a water-boiling, temperature<br>
maintenance, and a dry boiling prevention renders the control is not accurate.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The purpose of this invention is to provide a method of controlling electric kettles, and the<br>
technical problem to be solved by the invention is to associate each of controlling<br>
processes so as to control the working process of the electric kettles accurately.<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a method of controlling an electric<br>
kettle comprising the following steps: (1) detecting a temperature inside the electric kettle<br>
and determining a system preset value by a microprocessor after a power-up and<br>
initialization process; (2) detecting an ON/OFF state of a heating circuit; (3) detecting<br>
whether a process of temperature maintenance is performed; (4) performing a detection<br>
and control process of dry boiling protection; (5) detecting whether there is a request for<br>
heating or temperature maintenance; and (6) sending a "heating" or "temperature<br>
maintenance" signal to a control circuit, and then performing a control process of heating<br>
or temperature maintenance.<br>
After the process of heating or temperature maintenance is finished, the routine returns to<br>
an initialization state.<br>
The step of detecting the temperature inside the kettle by the microprocessor according to<br>
the invention is preformed by detecting a temperature at two points inside the kettle five<br>
times per second, and calculating an average temperature of the two points within one<br>
second.<br>
The system preset value is a value preset selected form calculation cycles, maximum<br>
heating periods, and a status parameter of whether the temperature maintenance process<br><br>
should be preformed after the water boils. The system preset value may be a group of set<br>
values obtained according to the volume and heating power of the electric kettle.<br>
When the microprocessor in the present invention detects the ON/OFF state of the heating<br>
circuit, the period of continuous heating is timed when the heating power supply is ON,<br>
and the stored heating period is reset to zero when the heating power supply is OFF.<br>
The microprocessor in the present invention detects whether the process of temperature<br>
maintenance is performed. When the heating circuit is in the state of the temperature<br>
maintenance, the microprocessor compares the average temperature with a preset lower<br>
limit temperature value of the temperature maintenance state. If the average temperature is<br>
higher, the microprocessor times the heating period of the temperature maintenance and<br>
then detects whether temperature-sensing components at the two measuring points work<br>
normally, and on the contrary, it directly detects whether the temperature-sensing<br>
components at the two points work normally. When the heating circuit is not in the state of<br>
the temperature maintenance, the microprocessor detects whether the temperature-sensing<br>
components at the two measuring points work normally. If the temperature-sensing<br>
components work abnormally, the microprocessor sends out an alert and switches off the<br>
heating power supply, and on the contrary, it enters the detection and control process of<br>
dry boiling protection.<br>
In detecting whether there is a request for heating or for temperature maintenance, the<br>
microprocessor according to the present invention detects whether there is a request for<br>
heating at first. If the request for heating is detected, the microprocessor sends a "heating"<br>
signal to the control circuit and controls the heating of the water inside the electric kettle.<br>
When the water boils, the microprocessor sends out a "stopping heating" signal.<br>
In detecting whether there is a request for heating, if no request for heating is detected, the<br>
microprocessor according to the present invention detects whether there is a request for<br>
temperature maintenance. If no request for temperature maintenance is detected, the<br>
routine returns to the initialization state. On the contrary, if the request for temperature<br>
maintenance is detected, the microprocessor detects whether there is a request of "the<br>
temperature maintenance process should be preformed after the water boils".<br><br>
In detecting whether there is a request of "the temperature maintenance process should be<br>
preformed after the water boils", if the request is detected, the microprocessor according to<br>
the present invention sends a "heating" signal to the control circuit and controls the<br>
heating of the water inside the electric kettle, and then performs a control process of<br>
temperature maintenance after the water boils. On the contrary, if no request is detected,<br>
the microprocessor sends a "heating for temperature maintenance" signal to the control<br>
circuit and performs the control process of temperature maintenance.<br>
In performing the detection and control process of dry boiling protection, the<br>
microprocessor according to the present invention calculates a rate of change of the<br>
temperature according to the average temperature, and compares the rate with its preset<br>
value. If the rate of change of the temperature is higher than the preset value, the<br>
microprocessor sends a "stopping heating" signal to the control circuit and sends out an<br>
alert. On the contrary, if the rate of change of the temperature is lower than its preset value,<br>
the microprocessor calculates an acceleration of change of the temperature, i.e., the rate of<br>
the temperature variation changing with time, and compares it with its preset value. If the<br>
acceleration is higher than its preset value, the microprocessor sends a "stopping heating"<br>
signal to the control circuit and sends out an alert. In addition, the microprocessor sends a<br>
"stopping heating" signal to the control circuit and sends out an alert if the continuous<br>
heating period is longer than the preset maximum heating period. In performing the<br>
control process of heating, the microprocessor calculates the rate of change of the<br>
temperature and compares it with that of a cycle ahead of the present cycle. If the rate of<br>
change of the temperature decreases and reaches a minimum value, the microprocessor<br>
sends a "stopping heating" signal to the control circuit. In performing the control process<br>
of temperature maintenance, the microprocessor sends a "heating" signal to the control<br>
circuit if the average temperature of the water is lower than a preset lower limit to drink,<br>
and if the average temperature of the water is higher than or equal to a preset upper limit<br>
to drink, the microprocessor sends a "stopping heating" signal to the control circuit. After<br>
sending the "heating" signal to the control circuit, the microprocessor compares the actual<br>
temperature of the water with a preset temperature. If the actual temperature of the water<br>
is higher than the preset temperature, the microprocessor sends a "stopping heating" signal<br>
to the control circuit. On the contrary, if the actual temperature of the water is lower than<br>
the preset temperature, the microprocessor calculates the rate of change of the temperature,<br>
and compares it with a preset rate of change of the temperature. If the calculated rate is<br><br>
higher than the preset rate, the microprocessor sends a "stopping heating" signal to the<br>
control circuit, and on the contrary, sends a "stopping heating after a delay time" signal to<br>
the control circuit.<br>
Compared with the prior art, the present invention adopts a microprocessor to associate the<br>
process of detecting the temperature inside the electric kettle, the process of determining a<br>
system preset value, the process of detecting the ON/OFF state of the heating circuit, the<br>
process of detecting whether a process of temperature maintenance is performed, the<br>
process of performing a detection and control process of dry boiling protection, the process<br>
of heating, and the process of temperature maintenance together in a system. With the<br>
continuous refreshment of the microprocessor, the present invention realizes the accurate<br>
control of each of the working processes of the electric kettle, which is convenient for use.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The objects, features and advantages of the invention will be more readily apparent from<br>
the following detailed description with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, a controlling method of an electric kettle according to the present<br>
invention comprises the following steps: (1) arranging temperature sensors, a<br>
microprocessor and a control circuit inside the electric kettle; (2) detecting a real-time<br>
temperature of water inside the electric kettle by the temperature sensors after a power-up<br><br>
and initialization process, and then transmitting the detected signal to the microprocessor;<br>
(3) determining a system preset value by the microprocessor; (4) detecting an ON/OFF<br>
state of a heating circuit, and timing a period of continuous heating; (5) detecting whether<br>
a process of temperature maintenance is performed, counting cycles of the heating for the<br>
temperature maintenance and timing a heating period for the temperature maintenance by<br>
the microprocessor; (6) detecting whether the temperature sensors at measuring points<br>
work normally; (7) performing a detection and control process of dry boiling protection; (8)<br>
detecting whether there is a request for heating or temperature maintenance; (9) sending a<br>
"heating" or "temperature maintenance" signal to the control circuit, and then performing<br>
a control process of heating or temperature maintenance; (10) returning to the initialization<br>
stage after the process of heating or temperature maintenance is finished.<br>
As shown in Figure 2-1 and Figure 2-2, after the power-up and initialization process,<br>
based on the temperature values detected by the temperature sensors five times per second<br>
at two measuring points (the center and edge of the electric kettle's underpan) inside the<br>
electric kettle, the microprocessor calculates the average temperature of these two points<br>
within one second. A set of inquiry codes, which represent ten groups of calculation cycles,<br>
ten groups of maximum heating periods and a status parameter of whether the temperature<br>
maintenance process should be preformed after the water boils, is preset in the<br>
microprocessor. Electric kettles with various volumes and heating power have their<br>
respective calculation cycles and maximum heating periods. With a conversion performed<br>
through an A/D conversion input interface of the microprocessor, the inquiry codes will be<br>
obtained. According to the inquiry codes, the microprocessor determines the preset<br>
calculation cycle and maximum heating period that adapt to the volume and heating power<br>
of the present electric kettle, and determines whether or not the temperature maintenance<br>
process should be preformed after the water boils. Afterwards, the microprocessor detects<br>
the ON/OFF state of the heating circuit, i.e., whether a relay of the heating circuit is closed.<br>
When a heating power supply of the heating circuit is ON, the microprocessor times the<br>
period of continuous heating; and when the heating power supply is OFF, the<br>
microprocessor resets the stored heating period to zero.<br>
The microprocessor detects whether the process of temperature maintenance is performed,<br>
i.e., whether the circuit is in the state of the temperature maintenance. When the heating<br>
circuit is in the state of the temperature maintenance, the microprocessor compares the<br><br>
average temperature with a preset lower limit temperature value of the temperature<br>
maintenance state. If the average temperature is higher than the lower limit temperature<br>
value, the microprocessor times the heating period for the temperature maintenance, and<br>
then detects whether the temperature-sensing components, which sense the temperature of<br>
the two measuring points, work normally. On the contrary, if the average temperature is<br>
lower than the lower limit temperature value, the microprocessor detects whether the<br>
temperature-sensing components work normally. When the heating circuit is not in the<br>
state of temperature maintenance, the microprocessor detects whether the<br>
temperature-sensing components work normally. In addition, the microprocessor counts a<br>
cycle of the rate of change of the temperature, and detects whether the<br>
temperature-sensing components work normally. If the temperature-sensing components<br>
work abnormally, the microprocessor sends out an alert and switches off the heating<br>
power supply. If the temperature-sensing components work normally, the routine proceeds<br>
to the detection and control process of dry boiling protection.<br>
Subsequently, the microprocessor firstly detects whether there is a request for heating. If<br>
there is, the microprocessor sends a "heating" signal to the control circuit, and enters a<br>
control process of boiling the water, i.e., controls the process of heating the water inside<br>
the electric kettle. If there is no request for heating, the microprocessor detects whether<br>
there is a request for temperature maintenance. If there is not, the routine returns to the<br>
initialization state. If there is a request for temperature maintenance, the microprocessor<br>
further detects whether there is a request for temperature maintenance after the water boils.<br>
If there is, the microprocessor sends a "heating" signal to the control circuit, and then<br>
enters the control process of boiling the water. After the water boils, the routine proceeds<br>
to the temperature maintenance control process. If there is no request for temperature<br>
maintenance after the water boils, the microprocessor sends a "heating for temperature<br>
maintenance" signal to the control circuit, and enters the temperature maintenance control<br>
process, i.e., controls the process of temperature maintenance.<br>
When performing the heating control process to boil the water, the microprocessor<br>
calculates the rate of change of the temperature, and compares the rate with that of a cycle<br>
ahead of the present cycle. If the rate of change of the temperature decreases and reaches a<br>
minimum value, the microprocessor sends a "stopping heating" signal to the control circuit,<br>
and returns to the state of the initialization after the heating control process of boiling the<br><br>
water is finished.<br>
As shown in Figure 3, when the microprocessor is performing the detection and control<br>
process of dry boiling protection, the control circuit switches on the heating power supply.<br>
When the continuous heating period is longer than or equal to the preset maximum heating<br>
period, the microprocessor switches off the heating power supply, and sends out an alert.<br>
On the other hand, when the continuous heating period is shorter than the preset maximum<br>
heating period, the current temperature will be detected and compared with a preset<br>
maximum temperature. If the temperature is higher than the preset maximum temperature,<br>
the microprocessor switches off the heating power supply and sends out an alert. On the<br>
contrary, if the temperature is lower than the preset maximum temperature, the<br>
microprocessor calculates the rate of change of the temperature and compares the rate with<br>
its preset value. If the rate of change of the temperature is higher than its preset value, the<br>
microprocessor switches off the heating power supply and sends out an alert. If, on the<br>
other hand, the rate of change of the temperature is lower than its preset value, the<br>
microprocessor calculates an acceleration of change of the temperature, i.e., the rate of the<br>
temperature variation changing with time. If the acceleration is higher than its preset value,<br>
the microprocessor switches off the heating power supply and sends out an alert. On the<br>
contrary, the microprocessor records the current rate of change of the temperature.<br>
As shown in Figure 4-1 and Figure 4-2, when performing the temperature maintenance<br>
control process, the microprocessor firstly detects whether the current stage is the heating<br>
for temperature maintenance. If it is not, the microprocessor detects whether the water<br>
temperature is higher than the preset value of the temperature maintenance. If the water<br>
temperature is lower than the preset value, the microprocessor sends a "heating" signal to<br>
the control circuit, and switches on the power supply for heating.<br>
The microprocessor compares the actual temperature of the water with preset temperature<br>
levels. Firstly, the actual temperature of the water is compared with a preset lowest<br>
temperature level, if the actual temperature of the water is higher, it will be compared with<br>
a preset higher temperature levels till a preset highest temperature level. If the actual<br>
temperature of the water is still higher than the preset highest temperature level, the<br>
microprocessor sends a "stopping heating" signal to the control circuit. The preset water<br>
temperatures are divided into five levels, the values of which increase from the first level<br><br>
up to the fifth. When the actual temperature of the water is lower than the current preset<br>
temperature level, the microprocessor calculates the current rate of change of the<br>
temperature, adds it with a preset regulation value of current level, and stores the sum. The<br>
preset regulation values are divided into four levels, which increase from the first level up<br>
to the fourth. The stored value, i.e., the sum is compared with a highest regulation<br>
comparative value. If the stored value is lower than the highest regulation comparative<br>
value level, it will be compared with lower regulation comparative value levels till a<br>
lowest regulation comparative value level. The preset regulation comparative values are<br>
divided into six levels, which decrease from the sixth level down to the first. If the stored<br>
value is higher than the regulation comparative value, a preset heating period<br>
corresponding to the regulation comparative value of current level is selected. The preset<br>
heating periods are divided into seven levels, the length of which increases from zero to<br>
the seventh level.<br>
If the actual temperature of the water is lower than the first preset temperature level, a<br>
value stored in storage is zero. If the actual temperature of the water is lower than the<br>
second preset temperature level, the microprocessor calculates the current rate of change<br>
of the temperature, adds it with the first preset regulation value level, and stores the sum.<br>
If the actual temperature of the water is lower than the third preset temperature level, the<br>
microprocessor calculates the current rate of change of the temperature, adds it with the<br>
second preset regulation value level, and stores the sum. If the actual temperature of the<br>
water is lower than the fourth preset temperature level, the microprocessor calculates the<br>
rate of change of the temperature, adds it with the third preset regulation value level, and<br>
stores the sum. If the actual temperature of the water is lower than the fifth preset<br>
temperature level, the microprocessor calculates the current rate of change of the<br>
temperature, adds it with the fourth preset regulation value level, and stores the sum. If the<br>
stored value, i.e., the sum is higher than the sixth regulation comparative value level, the<br>
heating period is set to zero. If the stored value is higher than the fifth regulation<br>
comparative value level, the heating period is set to the first preset heating period level. If<br>
the stored value is higher than the fourth regulation comparative value level, the heating<br>
period is set to the second preset heating period level. If the stored value is higher than the<br>
third regulation comparative value level, the heating period is set to the third preset<br>
heating period level. If the stored value is higher than the second regulation comparative<br>
value level, the heating period is set to the fourth preset heating period level. If the stored<br><br>
value is higher than the first regulation comparative value level, the heating period is set to<br>
the fifth preset heating period level. If the stored value is lower than the first regulation<br>
comparative value level, the heating period is set to the sixth preset heating period level.<br>
The purpose of presetting the temperature limits into different levels is to add the rate of<br>
change of the temperature with different regulation values, so as to compare with the<br>
regulation comparative value of the same level. An alternative method is comparing the<br>
actual temperature of the water with the preset temperature. If the actual temperature of<br>
the water is lower than the preset temperature, the microprocessor calculates the rate of<br>
change of the temperature and compares it with the preset rate of change of the<br>
temperature. On the contrary, if the actual temperature of the water is higher than the<br>
preset temperature, the microprocessor sends a "stopping heating" signal to the control<br>
circuit. If the calculated rate of change of the temperature is lower than the preset rate of<br>
change of the temperature, the microprocessor sends a "stopping heating after a delay<br>
time" signal to the control circuit.<br>
According to the temperatures of different levels, different preset regulation values are<br>
selected, so as to obtain different preset heating periods. The higher the temperature, the<br>
larger the preset regulation value and the shorter the preset heating period, which<br>
illustrates the negative relationship between the heating period for the temperature<br>
maintenance and the temperature.<br>
The maximum heating period within the current calculation cycle is preset in the<br>
microprocessor. If the heating period is higher than or equal to the preset maximum<br>
heating period, the microprocessor sends a "stopping heating within one cycle" signal to<br>
the control circuit, and detects whether one cycle is completed. On the contrary, if the<br>
heating period is lower than the preset maximum heating period, the heating process<br>
continues and the microprocessor detects whether one cycle is completed. If it is, the<br>
microprocessor calculates the rate of change of the temperature, stores the current<br>
temperature of the water, and compares the current temperature of the water with the first<br>
preset temperature level after resetting the heating period to zero. If one cycle is not<br>
completed, the microprocessor compares the current temperature of the water with the<br>
fifth preset temperature level. If the current temperature of the water is higher, the<br>
microprocessor sends a "stopping heating" signal to the control circuit. On the contrary,<br><br>
the microprocessor continues comparing the heating period within the cycle with the<br>
preset heating period. After the temperature maintenance control process is finished, the<br>
routine returns to the initialization state.<br><br>

7.	The method according to claim 6, wherein the step of detecting whether there is a<br>
request for heating or temperature maintenance includes:<br>
detecting whether there is a request for heating at first; and<br>
sending a "heating" signal to the control circuit and controlling the heating of<br>
the water inside the electric kettle when the request for heating is detected, and<br>
sending out a "stopping heating" signal when the water boils.<br><br>
8.	The method according to claim 7, comprising:<br>
detecting whether there is a request for temperature maintenance if no request for<br>
heating is detected; and<br>
returning to the initialization state when no request for temperature maintenance<br>
is detected, and, on the other hand, detecting whether there is a request of "the<br>
temperature maintenance process should be preformed after the water boils" if the<br>
request for temperature maintenance is detected.<br>
9.	The method according to claim 8, comprising:<br>
sending a "heating" signal to the control circuit and controlling the heating of the<br>
water inside the electric kettle if the request of "the temperature maintenance<br>
process should be preformed after the water boils" is detected, and then performing<br>
a control process of temperature maintenance after the water boils; and sending a<br>

sending a "stopping heating" signal to the control circuit and sending out an alert<br>
if the rate of change of the temperature is higher than its preset value, and, on the<br>
other hand, calculating an acceleration of change of the temperature if the rate of<br>
change of the temperature is lower than its preset value,<br>
sending a "stopping heating" signal to the control circuit and sending out an alert<br>
if the acceleration is higher than its preset value, and<br>
sending a "stopping heating" signal to the control circuit and sending out an alert<br>
when a continuous heating period is longer than a preset maximum heating period;<br><br>
the step of performing the control process of heating comprising:<br>
calculating the rate of change of the temperature, and comparing the rate with that of<br>
a cycle ahead of the present cycle, and<br>
sending a "stopping heating" signal to the control circuit when the rate of change<br>
of the temperature decreases and reaches a minimum value; and<br>
the step of performing the control process of temperature maintenance comprising:<br>
sending a "heating" signal to the control circuit when the average temperature of<br>
the water is lower than a preset lower limit to drink, and, on the other hand,<br>
sending a "stopping heating" signal to the control circuit when the average<br>
temperature of the water is higher than or equal to a preset upper limit to drink,<br>
comparing the actual temperature of the water with a preset temperature after<br>
the microprocessor sends the "heating" signal to the control circuit, sending a<br>
"stopping heating" signal to the control circuit if the actual temperature of the water is<br>
higher than the preset temperature,<br>
calculating the rate of change of the temperature and comparing it with a preset<br>
rate of change of the temperature if the actual temperature of the water is lower than<br>
the preset temperature of the water, and<br>
sending a "stopping heating" signal to the control circuit if the calculated rate of<br>
change of the temperature is higher than the preset rate of change of the<br>
temperature, and, on the other hand, sending a "stopping heating after a delay time"<br>
signal to the control circuit if the calculated rate of change of the temperature is lower<br>
than the preset rate of change of the temperature.<br><br><br><br>
ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
A METHOD OF CONTROLLING AN ELECTRIC KETTLE<br>
A controlling method comprises the following steps: (1) detecting a temperature inside<br>
the electric kettle and determining a system preset value by a microprocessor after a power-up<br>
and initialization process; (2) detecting an ON/OFF state of a heating circuit; (3) detecting<br>
whether a process of temperature maintenance is performed; (4) performing a detection and<br>
control process of dry boiling protection; (5) detecting whether there is a request for heating or<br>
temperature maintenance; and (6) sending a "heating" or "temperature maintenance" signal to a<br>
control circuit, and then performing a control process of heating or temperature maintenance.</td>
