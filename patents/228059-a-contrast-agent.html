				<td>A CONTRAST AGENT<br>
Peptide-Based Multimeric Targeted Contrast Agents<br>
RELATED APPLICATION DATA<br>
This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application Serial No.<br>
60/308,721, filed July 30,2001.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to contrast agents for diagnostic imaging, and more<br>
particularly to peptide-targeted, multimeric contrast agents, wherein a peptide functions<br>
as a targeting group and a point of attachment for one or more chelates at both the amino<br>
and carboxy termini of the peptide.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Diagnostic imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), X-<br>
ray, nuclear radiopharmaceutical imaging, ultraviolet-visible-infrared light imaging, and<br>
ultrasound, have been used in medical diagnosis for a number of years. Contrast media<br>
additionally have been used to improve or increase the resolution of the image or to<br>
provide specific diagnostic information.<br>
To be effective, the contrast media must interfere with the wavelength of<br>
electromagnetic radiation used in the imaging technique, alter the physical properties of<br>
tissue to yield an altered signal, or, as in the case of radiopharmaceuticals, provide the<br>
source of radiation itself. MRI and optical methods are unique among imaging modalities<br>
in that they yield complex signals that are sensitive to the chemical environment. While<br>
the signal from X-ray or radionuclide agents remains the same whether agents are free in<br>
plasma, bound to proteins or other targets, or trapped inside bone, certain contrast agents<br>
for MRI and optical imaging will have different signal characteristics in differing<br>
physiological environments. It is important that the contrast agent be sufficiently<br>
sensitive and present at high enough concentration so that signal changes can be<br>
observed.<br>
Complexes between gadolinium or other paramagnetic ions and organic ligands<br>
are widely used to enhance and improve MRI contrast Gadolinium complexes increase<br><br>
contrast by increasing the nuclear magnetic relaxation rates of protons found in the water<br>
molecules that are accessible to the contrast agents during MRI (Caravan, P., et al., R.B.<br>
Chem. Rev. 99, 2293 (1999)). The relaxation rate of the protons in these water molecules<br>
increases relative to protons in other water molecules that are not accessible to the<br>
contrast agent This change in relaxation rate leads to improved contrast of the images.<br>
In addition, this increase in relaxivity within a specific population of water molecule<br>
protons can result in an ability to collect more image data in a given amount of time. This<br>
in turn results in an improved signal to noise ratio.<br>
Imaging may also be performed using light, in which case an optical dye is chosen<br>
to provide signal. In particular, light in the 600-1300 nm (visible to near-infrared) range<br>
passes relatively easily through biological tissues and can be used for imaging purposes.<br>
The light that is transmitted through, or scattered by, reflected, or re-emitted<br>
(fluorescence), is detected and an image generated. Changes in the absorbance,<br>
reflectance, or fluorescence characteristics of a dye, including an increase or decrease in<br>
the number of absorbance peaks or a change in their wavelength maxima, may occur<br>
upon binding to a biological target, thus providing additional tissue contrast. In some<br>
situations, for example the diagnosis of disease close to the body surface, UV or visible<br>
light may also be used.<br>
A need persists for contrast agents that can deliver sufficient concentrations of the<br>
imaging moiety to the target to improve the sensitivity of the imaging process as well as<br>
contrast agents that have a sufficient half-life in vivo.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The invention is based on peptides and peptide-targeted multimeric contrast<br>
agents for MR, optical, and radionuclide imaging, wherein a single peptide can function<br>
both as a targeting group and a point of attachment for one or more chelates at both the N-<br>
and C- termini, either directly or via an optional intervening linker. Surprisingly, contrast<br>
agents of the invention maintain binding affinity for biological targets such as fibrin and<br>
high relaxivity. Agents of the invention have a sufficient half-life following in vivo<br>
administration such that effective imaging studies can be performed.<br><br>

For the purposes of this application, the term "leaving group" means any chemical<br>
moiety that is displaced by a nucleophile in a nucleophilic substitution or sequence of<br>
addition-elimination reactions. A molecule comprising a leaving group may be isolated<br>
or it may be formed in situ as a transient intermediate in a chemical reaction.<br>
For the purposes of this application, the term "aliphatic" describes any acyclic or<br>
cyclic, saturated or unsaturated, branched or unbranched carbon compound, excluding<br>
aromatic compounds.<br>
The term "alkyl" includes saturated aliphatic groups, including straight-chain<br>
alkyl groups (e.g., methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl,<br>
etc.), branched-chain alkyl groups (isopropyl, tert-butyl, isobutyl, etc.), cycloalkyl<br>
(alicyclic) groups (cyclopropyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, cyclooctyl), alkyl<br>
substituted cycloalkyl groups, and cycloalkyl substituted alkyl groups. The term alkyl<br>
further includes alkyl groups, which can further include oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur or<br>
phosphorous atoms replacing one or more carbons of the hydrocarbon backbone. In<br>
certain embodiments, a straight chain or branched chain alkyl has 6 or fewer carbon<br>

such compounds are stable at a temperature of 40ºC or less, in the absence of moisture or<br>
other chemically reactive conditions, for at least a week. Combinations of substituents<br>
and variables envisioned by this invention are only those that result in the formation of<br>
stable compounds.<br>
The terms "target binding" and "binding" for purposes herein refer to non-<br>
covalent interactions of a contrast agent with a target. These non-covalent interactions<br>

dipole-dipole, pi-stacking, hydrogen bonding, electrostatic associations, or Lewis acid-<br>
base interactions.<br>
The term "capping moiety" refers to a chelate, organic dye, contrast agent,<br>

Contrast Agents<br>
In general, the present invention relates to MRI, optical, and radionuclide contrast<br>
agents that include a targeting polymer (e.g., peptide) in which both the N- and C-<br><br>
terminal amino acids are each conjugated, either directly or via an optional intervening<br>
linker-subunit and linker, to at least one chelate of a paramagnetic (for magnetic<br>
resonance imaging) or radioactive (for radionuclide imaging) metal ion or an optical dye<br>
(for optical imaging). As further exemplified herein, the linker or linker-subunit may be<br>
branched and therefore allow for multiple chelates or dyes to be attached to each end of<br>
the peptide, i.e. a multimer. The compounds of this invention may contain one or more<br>
asymmetric carbon atoms and thus may occur as racemates and racemic mixtures, single<br>
enantiomers, diastereomeric mixtures and individual diastereomers. All such isomeric<br>
forms of these compounds are expressly included in the present invention. Each<br>
stereogenic carbon may be of the R or S configuration unless specifically designated<br>
otherwise. Although the specific compounds exemplified in mis application may be<br>
depicted in a particular stereochemical configuration, compounds having either the<br>
opposite stereochemistry at any given chiral center or mixtures thereof are also<br>
envisioned. It should be understood that the compounds of this invention may adopt a<br>
variety of conformational and ionic forms in solution, in pharmaceutical compositions<br>
and in vivo. Although the depictions herein of specific preferred compounds of this<br>
invention are of particular conformations and ionic forms, the disclosure of the invention<br>
is not so limited.<br>
Novel peptide-based multimers of the present invention offer several advantages<br>
as targeted contrast agents.<br>
1.	The compounds can deliver two or more capping moieties (e.g., chelates,<br>
organic dyes, or thrombolytics) to the target using a single targeting peptide<br>
so that sufficient improvement in the tissue contrast will be observed in part<br>
because of a meaningful concentration of the imaging moiety around the<br>
target.<br>
2.	The MRI contrast agents of this invention also exhibit a high relaxivity upon<br>
binding to the target due to the receptor induced magnetic enhancement<br>
(RIME) effect combined with the ability of the peptide to limit the local<br>
motion of individual chelates when bound to the target.<br>
3.	The compounds have a high affinity for one or more targets.<br><br>
4.	Since the compounds are relatively easy to synthesize according to the<br>
methods described herein and only one peptide per molecule is required, a<br>
multiplicity of metal ions or organic dyes may be delivered to a target more<br>
economically.<br>
5.	The compounds of the invention can have higher in vivo stability (i.e., longer<br>
half-lives) from diminished enzyme metabolism (e.g., decreased cleavage by<br>
peptidases).<br>
These favorable features of peptide-based multimers according to the present<br>
invention make them useful targeted contrast agents.<br>
The chemical structure of MRI and radionuclide contrast agents contemplated by<br>
the invention may be illustrated by the formula:<br><br>
wherein for each m, independently, 1≤m≤10, chelate represents a metal chelate<br>
complex, p is independently an integer from zero to five; s is independently one or zero;<br>
R1 is any amino acid side chain including side chains of non-natural amino acids; R2 is<br>
any aliphatic group or hydrogen; and n is an integer from 3 to 50 inclusive. Alternately,<br>
R1 and R2 may be taken together to form a ring structure (including proline and<br>
substituted versions thereof). Linkers, if present, may be different<br>
Metal ions preferred for MRI include those with atomic numbers 21-29,39-47, or<br>
57-83, and, more preferably, a paramagnetic form of a metal ion with atomic numbers 21-<br>
29,42,44, or 57-83. Particularly preferred paramagnetic metal ions are selected from the<br>
group consisting of Gd(III), Fe(III), Mn(II and III), Cr(III), Cu(II), Dy(III), Tb(III and<br>
IV), Ho(III), Er(III), Pr(III) and Eu(II and IE). Gd(III) is particularly useful. Note that,<br>
as used herein, the term "Gd" is meant to convey the ionic form of the metal gadolinium;<br>
such an ionic form can be written as GD(III), GD3+, gado, etc., with no difference in<br>
ionic form contemplated.<br>
For radionuclide imaging agents, radionuclides 90Y, 99mTo, 111nIn, 47Sc, 67Ga, 51Cr,<br>
177mSn, 67Cu, 167Tm, 97Ru, 188Re, 177Lu, 199Au, 203Pb, and 141Ce are particularly useful.<br><br>
Metal complexes with useful optical properties also have been described. See, Murru et<br>
al., J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Comm. 1993,1116-1118. For optical imaging using chelates,<br>
lanthanide chelates such as La(m), Ce(m), Pr(III), Nd(m), Pn(m), Sm(III), Eu(m),<br>
Gd(III), Tb(III), Dy(III), Ho(III), Er(III),Tm(III), Yb(III) and Ln(III) are suitable. Eu(III)<br>
and Tb(III) are particularly useful.<br>
Metal chelates should not dissociate to any significant degree during the imaging<br>
agent's passage through the body, including while bound to a target tissue. Significant<br>
release of free metal ions can result in toxicity, which would generally not be acceptable.<br>
In one embodiment, with reference to the above structure of a contrast agent, m is<br>
2, n, s, R1, and R2 are defined as above, and the Linker moiety comprises:<br><br>
The "Chelate" is preferably bb(CO)DTPA•Gd.<br>
In another embodiment, with reference to the above structure of a contrast agent,<br>
m is 2, n, s, R1, and R2 are defined as above, and the linker moiety comprises:<br><br>
The "Chelate" moiety can be bb(CO)DTPA•Gd.<br>
For the purposes of illustration, one contrast agent contemplated by the instant<br>
invention is presented below with the various subunits annotated:<br><br><br>
wherein R = amino acid side chains such that the peptide has affinity for a biological<br>
target, and m = metal ion (paramagnetic for MRI, radioactive for radionuclide imaging,<br>
and fluorescent, luminescent, or absorbant for optical imaging).<br>
The chemical structure of optical contrast agents contemplated by the invention<br>
may be illustrated by the formula:<br><br>
wherein l≤n≤10, p is independently an integer from zero to five, n is 3 to 50<br>
inclusive, R1 is any amino acid side chain including non-natural amino acid side chains,<br>
and R2 is any aliphatic group or hydrogen. Alternatively, R1 and R2 taken together form a<br>
ring structure (including Pro and derivatives thereof. The N- and C-terminal amino acids<br>
of the peptide can be conjugated to the optical dye directly or via an optional linker (e.g.,<br>
p = 0 or 1). The linker moieties can be different<br><br>
The optical dye may be an organic dye or an appropriate metal chelate. Organic<br>
dyes suitable for optical imaging have been described and include, for example,<br>
fluorescent porphyrin and fluorescent phthalocyanines [see, e.g., U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,641,878], particulate materials [see, e.g., WO 96/23524], and polymethine dyes [see,<br>
e.g., WO 97/13490]. Commonly used optical organic dyes are fluorescein, rhodamine<br>
[see, e.g., Kojima H, et al., Anal. Chem. 73,1967-1973 (2001)], tetramethylrhodamine<br>
[e.g., Anal. Biochem. 223,39 (1994)], and Texas red [e.g., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA<br>
85,3546 (1988)]. Fluorescein and luminescent lanthanide chelates are particularly<br>
useful.<br>
Targets and Target Binding Peptides<br>
The peptide moiety of the contrast agents of the present invention can exhibit<br>
specific binding for a biological target and function as a point of attachment for one or<br>
more chelates at each terminus. In general, biological targets are present in a low (e.g.,<br>
micromolar or less) concentration and are inefficiently imaged using existing monomelic<br>
gadolinium complex MPI contrast agents. The peptide-based multimeric MRI contrast<br>
agents according to the instant invention, however, provide a much higher concentration<br>
of the agent at the target as well as high relaxivity to make imaging of these targets<br>
possible. Similarly, the peptide-based multimeric radionuclide contrast agents of the<br>
invention may deliver more radionuclides to targets so that imaging can be further<br>
improved. While not being bound to a particular mechanism, it is thought that targeting<br>
creates an increased concentration of the imaging agent at the site to be imaged and<br>
increases the relaxivity of MRI contrast agents in the bound state through the RIME effect<br>
and also limits local chelate motion by rigidifylng the bound peptide.<br>
Targets for the contrast agents can be in any body compartment, cell, organ, or<br>
tissue or component thereof. Preferred targets are those that are of diagnostic and<br>
therapeutic relevance, i.e., those that are associated with disease states. Particularly<br>
preferred targets are those in association with body fluids, and particularly those in<br>
association with blood, plasma, lymph and fluids of the central nervous system. Other<br>
preferred targets are proteins and receptors that either exist in high concentration or have<br><br>
a large number of binding sites for certain ligands. Included among such target proteins<br>
are enzymes and glycoproteins.<br>
Human serum albumin (HSA) and fibrin are useful targets for MRI contrast<br>
agents. For vascular blood pool imaging, serum albumin is a preferred target Since HSA<br>
is present at high concentration in serum (approximately 0.6 mM) and binds a wide array<br>
of molecules with reasonably high affinity, it is a preferred target plasma protein for blood<br>
pool contrast agents. HSA is a particularly preferred target for cardiovascular imaging;<br>
see U.S. Patent Application No. 08/875,365, filed July 24,1997, and WO 96/23526.<br>
For imaging thrombi, fibrin is a preferred target because it is present in all clots<br>
and it can be targeted without interfering with the normal thrombolytic process. For<br>
additional details concerning target binding moieties that include fibrin-binding peptides,<br>
see PCT Patent Application WO 01/09188.<br>
Other protein targets include, but are not limited to, alpha acid glycoprotein,<br>
fibrinogen, collagen, platelet GPIIb/IIIa receptor, chemotactic peptide receptor,<br>
somatostatin receptors, vasoactive intestinal peptides (VIP) receptor, bombesin/Gastrin<br>
release peptide receptor, and integrin receptors.<br>
Suitable peptides for use in the invention include those capable of specifically<br>
binding to the targets identified above. Included among such peptides are RGD-<br>
containing peptides targeting platelet GPIIb/IIIa receptor for thrombus imaging,<br>
chemotactic peptides targeting white blood cells for infection/inflammation imaging,<br>
Octreotide and P-829 peptide targeting somastatin receptors for tumor imaging,<br>
vasoactive intestinal peptides (VIP) targeting VTP receptor for tumor imaging, bombesin<br>
analogs targeting bombesin/Gastrin release peptide receptor for tumor imaging, and<br>
RGD-containing peptides targeting the integrin αvβ3 (vitronectin receptor) for tumor<br>
imaging.<br>
In principle, any peptide with an affinity for a biological target may be used in a<br>
contrast agent of the invention. The peptide may be linear or cyclic. Ordinarily,<br>
insoluble lipophilic peptides are considered unsuitable for pharmacological use, but such<br>
peptides may be suitable according to the invention because addition of hydrophilic metal<br>
chelates to the two termini of the peptide may increase solubility. For ease of synthesis<br><br>
and cost considerations, it is preferred that the peptides have between 3 to 50 amino acids<br>
(e.g., 3 to 30,3 to 20,3 to 15,5 to 30,5 to 20,5 to 15,10 to 12 amino acids in length).<br>
In the targeting peptides of the invention, a great variety of amino acids can be<br>
used. Suitable amino acids include natural and non-natural amino acids. Amino acids<br>
with many different protecting groups appropriate for immediate use in the solid phase<br>
synthesis of peptides are commercially available. In addition to the twenty most common<br>
naturally occurring amino acids, the following non-natural amino acids or amino acid<br>
derivatives may be constituents of the peptide targeting group of the invention (common<br>

or "d" or "L" or "1" as appropriate. Additionally, αN-alkylated amino acids may be<br>
employed, as well as amino acids having amine-containing side chains (such as Lys and<br>
Orn) in which the amine has been acylated or alkylated.<br>
Peptides of the invention can include the general formula P*-Y*-X1*-L* (SEQ ID<br>
NO: 1), wherein P* is a proline or a non-natural derivative of proline, Y* is a tyrosine or a<br>
non-natural derivative thereof, X1* is glycine or aspartic acid, or a non-natural derivative<br>
of glycine or aspartic acid, and L* is leucine or a non-natural derivative thereof.<br>
Typically, at least one of P*, Y*, X1*, or L* is a non-natural derivative of the respective<br>
amino acid. For example, X1* can be glycine or aspartic acid, L* can be leucine, and at<br>
least one of P* or Y* can be a non-natural derivative, such as hydroxyproline or a<br>
tyrosine substituted at the 3 position with F, Cl, Br, I, or NO*.<br>
A peptide of the invention also can include the general formula X1* - X2 - C - P*-<br>

L, V, N, Bpa, Bal, Hfe, Nle, Tle, Nval, Phg, Cha, Taz, Fua, Th, 4-Pal, or F(3/4*), wherein<br>
F(3/4*) is a phenylalanine substituted at either the 3 or the 4 position with a moiety such<br>
as CF3, Et, iPr, or OMe; X6'' can be N, Q, I, L, or V, or not present Typically, at least one<br>
of X1, X2, X5, P*, and Y* is a non-natural derivative of an amino acid. For example, P*<br>
can be proline and Y* can be a non-natural derivative of tyrosine substituted at the 3<br>
position with a moiety such as F, Cl, Br, I, or NO2. Alternatively, P* can be a non-natural<br><br>
derivative of proline such as 4-hydroxyproIine and Y* can be tyrosine. Such peptides can<br>
form a disulfide bond under non-reducing conditions.<br>
Another example of a peptide that can bind fibrin includes the general formula C -<br>
P* - Y*- X1* - L - C (SEQ ID NO:3), wherein X1* is G or D, P* is proline or its non-<br>
natural derivative 4-hydroxyproline; Y* is tyrosine or a non-natural derivative of tyrosine<br>

(SEQ ID NO: 16). Such peptides can form disulfide bonds under non-reducing<br>
conditions.<br>
According to standard synthesis methods such as those disclosed in WO 01/09188<br>
or in WO 01/08712, peptides having the sequence set forth in Table 1 were synthesized<br>
(structure confirmed by mass spectrometry), cyclized, and assayed for affinity to the<br>
DD(E) fragment of fibrin. Each peptide was found to have a Kd ≤10 μM ("-" indicates<br>
truncation).<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
A peptide also can have the general formula C-D-Y-Y-G-T-C-X10 (SEQ ID.<br>
NO:17), wherein X10 is n(decyl)G, n(4-PhBu)G, MeL, Bpa, Bip, Me-Bip, F(4*), F(3-Me),<br>

phenylalanine substituted at the 4 position with a moiety such as Et, CF3,1, or iPr. In<br>
some embodiments, a peptide can include additional residues, X1, P*, and/or X11, to<br>
provide the general formula: C-D-Y-Y-G-T-C-X10-Xu (SEQ ID. NO: 18) or X1-P*-C-D-<br>

Peptides having the formula of SEQ ID NO:26 were synthesized (structure<br>
confirmed by mass spectrometry) according to standard synthesis methods, such as those<br>
disclosed in WO 01/09188 or in WO 01/08712, and assayed for affinity to the DD(E)<br>
fragment of fibrin. Each peptide was found to have a Kd ≤ 10 μM (Table 2).<br><br><br>
The ability of the peptides to bind a target such as HSA or fibrin can be assessed<br>
by known methodology. For example, affinity of the peptide for fibrin can be assessed<br>
using the DD(E) fragment of fibrin, which contains subunits of 55 kD (Fragment E) and<br>
190 kD (Fragment DD). The DD(E) fragment can be biotinylated and immobilized via<br>
avidin to a solid substrate (e.g., a multi-well plate). Peptides can be incubated with the<br>
immobilized DD(E) fragment in a suitable buffer and binding detected using known<br>
methodology. See, for example, WO 01/09188.<br>
N- and C-Terminus Linker-subunits and Linker<br>
If present, linker-subunits and linkers are used to covalently attach capping<br>
moieties such as chelates, thrombolytics, and other groups to the two ends of a peptide. A<br>
linker-subunit moiety can (i) convert the functionality of either the C-terminus<br>
carboxylate to an amine functional group or the N-terminus amine to a carboxylate<br>
functional group; or (ii) provide a spacer moiety or group between the peptide terminus<br>
and the linker, if present, or capping group. In one embodiment, a peptide can be reacted<br>
with a linker-subunit to form a modified peptide having a C-terminal amine functional<br>
group and a N-terminal amine functional group. In another embodiment, a peptide can be<br>
reacted with a linker-subunit to form a modified peptide having a N-terminal carboxylate<br>
functional group and a C-terminal carboxylate functional group. In another embodiment,<br>
a peptide can be synthesized from a C-terminal linker-subunit that is bound to a resin,<br>
whereby upon cleaving the peptide from the resin, a peptide having a C-terminal amine<br>
functional group is produced. In still another embodiment, a linker-subunit can be used<br>
as a spacer group and not to change the terminus functional group. A linker-subunit may<br>
have multiple functional groups for attachment of linker moieties or capping moieties.<br>
Many types of reactions can be used, including acylation, reductive animation,<br>
nucleophilic displacement reactions, urea formation, thiourea formation, and<br>
chemoselective ligation in chemically conjugating the linker-subunit to the peptide,<br>
linker, and/or capping moieties. One advantage of using a linker-subunit is to create<br>
similar functional groups on the peptide, thereby facilitating subsequent synthesis.<br>
The linker moiety can be used to covalently attach one or more capping moieties<br>
to the peptide terminus. The linker may be branched or unbranched and may comprise<br><br>
multiple functional groups for precursor chelate and chelate attachment The chemical<br>
structure of the linker may affect the physical and pharmacological properties of the<br>
contrast agent, such as affinity, stability, blood half-life, relaxivity, and plasma protein<br>
binding. Linkers may be substituted with alkyl, aryl, alkenyl, or alkynyl groups. Linkers,<br>
if present, at each termini, typically are relatively small and rigid for MRI contrast agents.<br>
For example, a linker can have a molecular weight less than about 350 (e.g., less than<br>
about 200).<br>
An example of a C-terminal linker-subunit moiety and a C- and N-terminal linker<br>
is illustrated in the following structure:<br><br>
The C-terminus carboxylate of a peptide may be converted to an amine functional<br>
group with a linker-subunit (e.g., a diamine synthon) to form a peptide having an amine<br>
functional group on each end of the peptide to which the remaining linker moiety can be<br>
attached. Examples of such peptides modified to have a C-terminal amine function group<br>
are:<br><br><br><br><br>
In some cases, the following linker-subunits may be employed as spacer groups at<br>
the N-terminal amine functional group:<br>
wherein "Base" is a purine or pyrimidine base ("Ad" = adenosine, "Gu" =<br>
guanosine, "Th" = thymine, "Cy" = cytosine) and "LG" is a leaving group such as OH,<br>
activated ester, halide, or anhydride.<br><br>
Additionally, αN-alkylated amino acids may be employed, as well as amino acids<br>
having amme-containing side chains (such as Lys and Orn) in which the amine has been<br>
acylated or alkylated as in the following examples:<br><br>
wherein n is an integer from 0 to 3, R is any aliphatic or aromatic group, and LG<br>
is a leaving group such as OH, activated ester, halide, and anhydride.<br>
Still more linker-subunits include the following:<br><br>
wherein n is independently 1 or 2, R is any aliphatic or aromatic group, and LG is<br>
a leaving group such as OH, activated ester, halide, and anhydride.<br>
Examples of linker moieties that are useful when following an amide bond<br>
construction strategy in which a peptide molecule has two terminal amine groups include<br>
the following:<br><br><br>
wherein each m is independently an integer from 1 to 4, n is independently an integer<br>
from 0 to 4 inclusive, LG is a leaving group, and R' or R" are independently hydrogen or<br>
a chemical protecting group.<br>
A linker moiety also may have branch points for attachment of more than two<br>
chelates. For example, when following an amide bond formation strategy, a linker that<br>
includes a carbonyl with a leaving group LG (for example, a carboxylic acid or an<br>
activated ester) and three or more protected amines can be reacted with a peptide amine to<br>
create a molecule with three or more terminal amines. The following carbonyl-based<br>
linker reagents may be appropriate for introducing three or more amine functional groups:<br><br><br>
wherein LG is a leaving group (e.g:, -OH, activated ester such as<br>
pentafluorophenol (Pfp), N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide<br>
sodium salt (NHSS), 2-thioxothiazolidin-lyl, or hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT) and R1 and<br>
R2 are preferably independently hydrogen or a chemical protecting group (e.g.^Boc,<br>
Fmoc, CBZ, t-butyl, benzyl, or allyl).<br>
In other embodiments, an amine functional group at the N-tenninus of a peptide<br>
may be converted to an N-terminus carboxylate functional group by reaction with a cyclic<br>
acid anhydride (linker-subunit moiety) thereby producing a modified peptide with a N-<br>
terminal carboxylate functional group:<br><br>
Examples of other linker-subunits that can be used to convert an N-terminal amine<br>
to a carboxylate functional group include:<br><br>
wherein R is any aliphatic or aromatic group.<br>
Subsequently, both terminal carboxylates in the above examples may be<br>
simultaneously reacted with an amino group on a linker moiety as shown below to form a<br>
precursor MR imaging agent. In this example, the precursor MR imaging agent is a<br>
peptide molecule derivatized with linkers at both termini thru amide bonds:<br><br><br>
Specific examples of additional linker moieties useful for producing precursor MR<br>
imaging agents terminating with two carboxylates are:<br><br>
wherein each m is independently 1 to 4 inclusive, n is independently 0 to 4 inclusive (e.g.,<br>
n = 1 or 2), and R is hydrogen or an appropriate chemical protecting group, such as<br>
methyl, ethyl, benzyl, or t-butyl. In these examples, following attachment of the linker-<br>
subunits, the protecting groups can be removed and chelating or precursor chelating<br>
moieties can be attached through standard methods, for example, amide bond formation.<br>
When following an amide bond construction strategy in which a peptide molecule<br>
is terminated with two carboxylates, the following linker reagents may be appropriate to<br>
introduce three or more amine functional groups:<br><br><br>
wherein R and R are independently hydrogen or a chemical protecting group<br>
such as OS, Boc, Fmoc, CBZ, tbutyl, benzyl, or allyl.<br>
Linker strategies that involve formation of amide bonds are useful because they<br>
typically are compatible with the protecting groups on the peptide. As mentioned above,<br>
the peptide, linker, and linker-subunits may be covalently attached to each other by<br>
formation of other bond types (nucleophilic displacement, reductive amination and<br>
thiourea formation, for example).<br>
The linkers may also have effects on the properties of the contrast agents such as<br>
affinity, pharmacokinetic properties, stability in vivo, and relaxivity.<br>
Alternatively, a covalent conjugate that includes both a linker moiety and a<br>
chelating or chelating precursor moiety can be reacted directly with a peptide with<br>
appropriate terminal functionality. One example of such a covalent conjugate capable of<br>
reacting with terminal carboxylate groups follows:<br><br>
wherein n = 1 to 4, and R1, R2, R3, R4, and R5 are independently an acetate group,<br>
acetamide group, or an acetoxy group.<br>
Another example of such a covalent conjugate has the following structure:<br><br><br>
wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, and R5 are independently an acetate group, acetamide<br>
group, or an acetoxy group.<br>
An example of a covalent conjugate useful for converting a modified peptide with<br>
carboxylate functional groups at the two termini to a precursor imaging agent has the<br>
following structure:<br><br><br>
Examples of covalent conjugates capable of reacting with amine functional groups<br>
on a modified peptide are:<br><br>
wherein LG is a leaving group, n = 1 to 4, and R1, R2, R3, R4, and R5 are independently an<br>
acetate group, acetamide group, or an acetoxy group, and<br><br>
wherein LG is a leaving group, wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, and R5 are independently<br>
an acetate group, acetamide group, or an acetoxy group.<br>
A particularly useful covalent conjugate for synthesizing a multimer contrast<br>
agent has the following structure, hereinafter "Synthon #1":<br><br><br>
Another embodiment of a covalent conjugate useful for synthesizing a multimer<br>
has the following structure, hereinafter "Synthon #2:<br><br>
In the following example of an MRI contrast agent of the invention that includes a<br>
peptide as outlined above, the effect of the N-terminus linker on the relaxivity of MRI<br>
contrast agents is illustrated:<br><br>
In this example, "chelate" refers to bb-DTPA-Gd(III).<br>
The "Linker-subunit" above was varied with the following results (relaxivities per<br>
Gd(III) ion were determined at 20 MHz and 35ºC, units are mM-1V-1):<br><br><br>
As shown above, structures 15 and 16 are similar to 32 except for different N-<br>
terminal linker-subunits. The experimental results show that a linker can affect the<br>
relativity, as well as other characteristics of a contrast agent of the invention.<br>
Chelating Moieties and Reagents<br>
Chelating moieties are chelating ligands complexed with metal ions. These<br>
chelating moieties contain a synthetic moiety capable of forming a point of attachment to<br>
the linker, linker-subunit, and/or modified peptide. One or more chelating moieties may<br>
be covalently conjugated to the functional group at each terminus of the modified peptide.<br>
In one embodiment, the chelate is attached to a linker-subunit. In another embodiment,<br>
the chelate is attached to a linker moiety. In other embodiments, the chelate may be<br>
conjugated with a linker moiety to form a covalent conjugate before attaching the<br>
covalent conjugate to the modified peptide.<br>
Precursor chelating moieties are chelating ligands that have not been complexed<br>
with metal ions. Chelating ligands may have protecting groups or may be precursors to<br>
chelating ligands. Precursor chelating moieties have a synthetic moiety capable of<br>
forming a point of attachment to the linker, linker-subunit, and/or modified peptide.<br>
Precursor chelating moieties can be converted into chelating moieties by complexing with<br>
a metal ion. One or more precursor chelate moieties may be covalently conjugated to the<br><br>
functional group at each terminus of the modified peptide. In one embodiment, the<br>
precursor chelate can be attached to a linker-subunit. In another embodiment, the<br>
precursor chelate is attached to a linker moiety. In other embodiments, the precursor<br>
chelate may be conjugated with a linker moiety to form a covalent conjugate before<br>
attaching the covalent conjugate to the modified peptide.<br>
Precursor chelate moieties and chelate moieties according to the invention can<br>
have any of the following structures:<br><br><br><br>
wherein X is a heteroatom electron-donating group capable of coordinating a<br>
metal cation, such as O", OH, NH2, OPO32-, NHR, or OR, wherein R is any aliphatic<br>
group; Rl is an uncharged chemical moiety, selected from hydrogen, any aliphatic, alkyl<br>
group, or cycloalkyl group, or uncharged substituted versions thereof (e.g. alcohols); and<br>
Y is a synthetic moiety (e.g., capable of forming a point of attachment, or being the point<br>
of attachment, to the functional group of the modified peptide, linker, and/or linker-<br>
subunit either directly or with an intervening carbonyl, methylene, methylene-oxygen,<br>
thiocarbonyl). Moieties with (chelate moiety) or without (precursor chelate moiety) a<br>
coordinated metal ion may be used.<br>
A variety of chelating ligands may be used in contrast agents of the invention.<br>
Such chelating ligands include, but are not limited to, derivatives of DTPA, DOTA,<br>
NOTA, and DO3 A. For MRI, metal chelates such as gadolinium<br>
diemylenetriaminepentaacetate (DTPA•Gd), gadolinium tetraamine 1,4,7,10-<br>
tetraazayclododecane-N,N',N',N'-tetraacetate (DOTA'Gd) and gadolinium 1,4,7,10-<br>
tetraazacyclododecane-l,4,7-triacetate (D03A•Gd) are particularly useful. Particularly<br>
useful chelates include bb(CO)DTPA•Gd. Other metals may be substituted for Gd(III) in<br>
MRI applications.<br>
Examples of functionalized chelates that have been synthesized for the purpose of<br>
preparing multimeric chelates include pNCS-Bz-DTPA [Martin, V., et al. Bioconiugate<br>
Chem. 6,616-23,1995] and Gd(4-NCS-phenyl)-amino-carbonylmethyl-D03A<br>
[Ramachandran, R. et al., Invest. Rad. 1998, 33(11), 779-797]. For optimal relaxivity<br>
properties when bound to a target, it is frequently desirable to minimize chelate motion,<br>
and hence, a minimal number of covalent bonds linking the target to the chelating ligand<br>
are desirable. Below is an example of a reagent that includes a chelating ligand with a<br>
backbone carbonyl group for connecting to an amine functional group or a linker-subunit<br>
or linker, wherein "LG" is a leaving group (e.g., an activated ester) and R represents a<br><br>
group which may be easily cleaved to form O- (-OtBu, e.g. a carboxylate ester) thereby<br>
forming a carboxylate with the neighboring carbonyl group:<br><br>
It has been found that the chemical motif of a carbonyl immediately adjacent to a<br>
chelating ligand constitutes a class of high relaxivity MRI contrast agents.<br>
The present invention also relates to intermediates useful in the synthesis of<br>
contrast agents for MRI according to the following formulae:<br><br>
wherein, R1, R2, R3, R4, and R5 may be any protected or unprotected acetyl ligand<br>
suitable for forming a chelate of a paramagnetic metal with an appropriate formation<br>
constant, including the following:<br>
, wherein P is any protecting group, including<br>
benzyl and tert-butyl groups. LG is a "leaving group" and represents -OH and ester<br>
forms thereof including, NHS esters, pentafluorophenol, and other activated esters.<br>
In a particularly useful embodiment, LG is -OH, and R1, R2, R3, R4, and R5 are<br>
CH2CO2O1Bu, hereinafter "Synthon #3, and has the following structure:<br><br><br>
Alternatively, the following reagent may be used in the synthesis of contrast<br>
agents of the invention:<br><br>
The present invention also provides methods of manufacturing compounds. In<br>
particular, a novel oxidation reaction permits the facile preparation of Synthon #3, a<br>
preferred embodiment of a chelating ligand. The synthesis of Synthon #3 can be achieved<br>
through two different synthetic routes, both commencing with hydroxymethyl-<br>
diemylenetriamine. One route involves a two synthetic step sequence (alkylation,<br>
followed by oxidation) and the other involves a six-step process (protection, oxidation,<br>
esterification, deprotection, alkylation and hydrogenolysis). Both produce Synthon #3 in<br>
high chemical and optical purity {vide Examples, below).<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,637,759 discloses a synthesis of Synthon #1 from<br>
2,3-diaminopropionic acid and aza-lysine by a selective hydrolysis protocol with sodium<br>
thiophenoxide. The method disclosed herein avoids the use of this toxic reagent<br>
Synthesis of Contrast Agents<br>
Synthesis of the peptide-based contrast agents may be carried out in the following<br>
steps. First, a targeting peptide can be synthesized with or without a C-terminal linker-<br>
subunit, typically using solid phase peptide synthesis. For cyclic peptides described<br>
herein, a protected linear peptide may be cyclized in solution or on the resin. Unprotected<br>
peptide may also be cyclized in solution or on resin. A C-terminal linker-subunit may be<br><br>
conveniently derived from the solid phase synthesis resin and an N-terminus linker or N-<br>
terminal linker-subunit can be coupled to the peptide during the solid phase synthesis.<br>
Typically, following cyclization, the linker-subunit-chelate precursor moieties were<br>
coupled to the peptide. Protecting groups were removed to provide the ligand precursors,<br>
and then chelates were prepared. Radionuclide compounds of this invention were<br>
prepared from ligand precursors using commercially available radionuclides (for<br>
example, 99mTc from Nycomed Amersham Boston cat. #RX-290195, 111In from NEN Life<br>
Science Products cat. # NEZ304, or 153Gd from NEN Life Science Products cat. #<br>
NEZ142) by reaction in aqueous media, typically at pH 4-6 for 1 hour. In the case of<br>
optical contrast agents, an organic dye may be substituted for a chelate precursor.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Properties of Contrast Agents<br>
Compounds of this invention can be more stable with respect to degradation by<br>
endogenous enzymes than the parent peptide (i.e., the peptide without any attached<br>
chelates), a peptide with one or more chelates attached to the N-tenninus, or a peptide<br>
with one or more chelates attached to the C-terminus. To estimate in vivo stability, test<br>
compounds can be incubated with rat liver homogenates. After selected intervals, the<br>
reactions can be quenched and centrifuged, and the supernatant can be analyzed by liquid<br>
chromatography-mass spectrometry to quantitate the amount of compound remaining.<br>
Compounds of the invention also can bind a target such as human serum albumin<br>
or fibrin. For example, at least 10% (e.g., at least 50%, 80%, 90%, 92%, 94%, or 96%) of<br>
the contrast agent can be bound to the desired target at physiologically relevant<br>
concentrations of drug and target The extent of binding of a contrast agent to a target,<br>
such as HSA or fibrin, can be assessed by a variety of equilibrium binding methods. For<br>
example, binding to HSA can be measured by ultrafiltration. For measuring binding to<br>
fibrin, a fibrin clot may be formed in a well of a microtiter plate and contacted with the<br>
targeting group. After an incubation time sufficient to establish equilibrium, the<br>
supernatant is removed by aspiration (the insoluble fibrin remains bound as a gelled clot<br>
to the bottom of the well). The concentration of unbound targeting group in the<br>
supernatant is then measured. In both methodologies, the concentration of bound contrast<br>
agent is determined as the difference between the total targeting group concentration<br>
initially present and the unbound targeting group concentration following the binding<br>
assay. The bound fraction is the concentration of bound targeting group divided by the<br>
concentration of total targeting group.<br>
Compounds of the invention can exhibit high relaxivity as a result of target<br>
binding (e.g., to fibrin), which can lead to better image resolution. The increase in<br>
relaxivity upon binding is typically 1.5-fold or more (e.g., at least a 2,3,4, 5,6,7, 8,9, or<br>
10 fold increase in relaxivity). Targeted contrast agents having 7-8 fold, 9-10 fold, or<br>
even greater than 10 fold increases in relaxivity are particularly useful. Typically,<br>
relaxivity is measured using an NMR spectrometer. The preferred relaxivity of an MRI<br>
contrast agent at 20 MHz and 37 °C is at least 10 mM-ls-1 per paramagnetic metal ion<br>
(e.g., at least 15,20,25,30,35,40, or 60 mM-ls-1 per paramagnetic metal ion. Contrast<br><br>
agents having a relaxivity greater than 60 mM-Is-1 at 20 MHz and 37°C are particularly<br>
useful.<br>
As described herein, targeted contrast agents can show an increase in clot uptake.<br>
Specificity of uptake of fibrin-targeted agents can be determined by comparing-the uptake<br>
of the agent by blood clots to the uptake by blood. See Example 11 for more details. The<br>
specificity of fibrin-targeted contrast agents also can be demonstrated using MRI and<br>
observing enhancement of clot signal.<br>
Use of Peptides and Contrast Agents of the Invention<br>
Peptides of the invention can be used to improve therapies for treating<br>
thromboembolic disease. Current thrombolytic therapy has limitations, including a<br>
significant risk of bleeding, failure to restore blood flow, thrombotic reocclusion after<br>
cessation of therapy, and a lag between initiation of therapy and clot lysis. An improved<br>
therapeutic index can be achieved by conjugating a fibrin targeting peptide of the<br>
invention to a thrombolytic agent (e.g., a protein thrombolytic such as plasminogen<br>
activators of human or bacterial origin). Such conjugates can activate plasminogen<br>
locally or increase endogenous levels of tPA. For example, a fibrin targeting peptide can<br>
be conjugated to human plasminogen activators including recombinant tissue type<br>
plasminogen activator (tPA), prourokinase and urokinase (both single and two chain<br>
forms), bacterium derived plasminogen activator including streptokinase, staphylokinase,<br>
and animal derived plasminogen activators, including vampire bat plasminogen activator.<br>
In addition, fibrin targeting peptides can be conjugated to fibrinolytics such as copperhead<br>
snake fibrolase, which exhibits direct fibrinolytic activity. Such enzymes and proteins<br>
can be obtained commercially, extracted from natural sources or tissues, or prepared<br>
recombinantly.<br>
The compositions of the invention can be linked or fused in known ways, using<br>
the same type of linkers discussed above with respect to constructing MRl contrast<br>
agents. Conjugation to a protein can be achieved by standard chemical techniques<br>
including the formation of amide, ester, disulfide, and thioether bonds. For example, a<br>
fibrin binding peptide can be covalently linked, either directly or through a linker, to a<br>
protein by forming an amide bond between the fibrin binding peptide or the linker and the<br><br>
lysine residues on the surface of the protein. These surface lysine residues are usually<br>
distant from the enzyme's catalytic site. Therefore, the tethered moieties do not interfere<br>
with the enzyme's catalytic activity. Multiple ligation can be achieved in a single step.<br>
The ratio of the fibrin targeting peptide to the thrombolytic or fibrinolytic agent can be<br>
controlled by adjusting the stoichiometry of the ligation chemistry. Multiple ligation is<br>
particularly useful in the case of a moderately strong fibrin binding ligand because higher<br>
binding affinity can be realized through the so called "avidity" effect. In particular, a<br>
coupling agent or an activated ester can be used to achieve amide bond formation<br>
between the lysine and the fibrin binding moiety or the linker. The below scheme shows<br>
an example of a hybrid molecule formed by chemical ligation of urokinase to multiple<br>
fibrin binding peptides via linker moieties. The number of surface lysine residues and the<br>
number of fibrin binding molecules are illustrative. Alternatively, the fibrin targeting<br>
peptide can be incorporated into the hybrid molecule using recombinant DNA<br>
technology.<br><br>
In some embodiments, peptides of the invention can be linked to a thrombolytic<br>
agent with a linker encompassing an enzymatic cleavage site, e.g., an enzymatic cleavage<br>
site normally cleaved by enzymes in the coagulation cascade, such as Factor Xa,<br>
thrombin, or plasmin cleavage sites, etc. The thrombolytic agent is not activated until it is<br>
cleaved from the clot binding compositions of the invention at the site of the clot, the risk<br>
of unwanted bleeding events at sites distant from the clot would be minimized.<br><br>
Furthermore, thrombolytic moieties can be linked to a peptide-targeted multimeric<br>
contrast agent such that a clot can be identified, imaged and dissolved.<br>
Contrast agents prepared according to the disclosures herein may be used in the<br>
same manner as conventional MRI contrast agents and are useful for the diagnosis of<br>
deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, coronary thrombosis, carotid and intracranial<br>
thrombosis, atrial and ventricular thrombi, aortic arch thrombi, and high risk plaque.<br>
When imaging a thrombus, certain MR techniques and pulse sequences may be preferred<br>
to enhance the contrast of the thrombus compared to the background blood and tissues.<br>
These techniques include, but are not limited to, black blood angiography sequences that<br>
seek to make blood dark, such as fast spin echo sequences and flow-spoiled gradient echo<br>
sequences. These methods also include flow independent techniques that enhance the<br>
difference in contrast due to the T1 difference between contrast-enhanced thrombus and<br>
blood and tissue, such as inversion-recovery prepared or saturation-recovery prepared<br>
sequences that will increase the contrast between thrombus and background tissues.<br>
Methods of preparation for T2 techniques may also prove useful. Finally, preparations<br>
for magnetization transfer techniques may also improve contrast with agents of the<br>
invention.<br>
Compositions of the invention, including peptides, peptides conjugated to<br>
thrombolytics, and peptide-targeted multimeric contrast agents, can be formulated as a<br>
pharmaceutical composition in accordance with routine procedures. As used herein, the<br>
compounds of the invention can include pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof.<br>
"Pharmaceutically acceptable" means that the compound or composition can be<br>
administered to an animal without unacceptable adverse effects. A "pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable derivative" means any pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, salt of an ester,<br>
or other derivative of a compound of this invention mat, upon administration to a<br>
recipient, is capable of providing (directly or indirectly) a compound of this invention or<br>
an active metabolite or residue thereof. Other derivatives are those that increase the<br>
bioavailability of the compounds of this invention when such compounds are<br>
administered to a mammal (e.g., by allowing an orally administered compound to be more<br>
readily absorbed into the blood) or which enhance delivery of the parent compound to a<br>
biological compartment (e.g., the brain or lymphatic system) thereby increasing the<br><br>
exposure relative to the parent species. Phannaceutically acceptable salts of the<br>
compounds of this invention include counter ions derived from pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable inorganic and organic acids and bases known in the art.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be administered by any route,<br>
including both oral and parenteral administration. Parenteral administration includes, but<br>
is not limited to, subcutaneous, intravenous, intraarterial, interstitial, intrathecal, and<br>
intracavity administration. When administration is intravenous, pharmaceutical<br>
compositions may be given as a bolus, as two or more doses separated in time, or as a<br>
constant or non-linear flow infusion. Thus, compositions of the invention can be<br>
formulated for any route of administration.<br>
Typically, compositions for intravenous administration are solutions in sterile<br>
isotonic aqueous buffer. Where necessary, the composition may also include a<br>
solubilizing agent, a stabilizing agent, and a local anesthetic such as lidocaine to ease pain<br>
at the site of the injection. Generally, the ingredients will be supplied either separately,<br>
e.g. in a kit or mixed together in a unit dosage form, for example, as a dry lyopbitized<br>
powder or water free concentrate. The composition may be stored in a hermetically<br>
sealed container such as an ampule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent in<br>
activity units. Where the composition is administered by infusion, it can be dispensed<br>
with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade "water for injection,"<br>
saline, or other suitable intravenous fluids. Where the composition is to be administered<br>
by injection, an ampule of sterile water for injection or saline may be provided so that the<br>
ingredients may be mixed prior to administration. Pharmaceutical compositions of this<br>
invention comprise the compounds of the present invention and pharmaceutically<br>
accetable salts thereof, with any pharmaceutically acceptable ingredient, excipient,<br>
carrier, adjuvant or vehicle.<br>
A contrast agent is preferably administered to the patient in the form of an<br>
injectable composition. The method of administering a contrast agent is preferably<br>
parenterally, meaning intravenously, intra-arterially, intrathecally, interstiually or<br>
intracavitarilly. Pharmaceutical compositions of this invention can be administered to<br>
mammals including humans in a manner similar to other diagnostic or therapeutic agents.<br>
The dosage to be administered, and the mode of administration will depend on a variety<br><br>
of factors including age, weight, sex, condition of the patient and genetic factors, and will<br>
ultimately be decided by medical personnel subsequent to experimental determinations of<br>
varylng dosage followed by imaging as described herein. In general, dosage required for<br>
diagnostic sensitivity or therapeutic efficacy will range from about 0.001 to 50,000 μg/kg,<br>
preferably between 0.01 to 25.0 μg/kg of host body mass. The optimal dose will be<br>
determined empirically following the disclosure herein.<br>
With respect to treatment of thrombolytic conditions, the quantity of material<br>
administered will depend on the seriousness of the thromboembolic condition and<br>
position and the size of the clot The precise dose to be employed and the mode of<br>
administration can be decided according to the circumstances by the physician<br>
supervising treatment In general, dosages of the combined composition/thrombolytic<br>
agent conjugate will follow the dosages that are routine for the thrombolytic agent alone,<br>
although the improved affinity for fibrin/clot binding added by the compositions<br>
disclosed herein may allow a decrease in the standard thrombolytic dosage. Particular<br>
thrombolytics contemplated for use in this therapy (with examples of dose and method of<br>
administration) are as follows:<br>
Streptokinase	1-3 megaunits over 30 minutes to 3 hrs<br>
Anistreplase	30 units; 2-5 minute injection<br>
tPA (wild-type)	50-150 mg; infusion over up to 6 hrs<br>
Two-chain urokinase (40-100 mg); infusion over up to 6 hrs<br>
Single-chain urokinase (scuPA) 3-12 megaunits (30-100 mg; infusion over up to 5<br>
hrs<br>
Hybrid plasminogen activators and derivatives 20-100 mg; injection or<br>
infusion<br>
Muteins of plasminogen activators 10-100 mg; injection or infusion<br>
The invention will be further described in the following examples, which do not<br>
limit the scope of the invention described in the claims.<br>

practice of the invention, and they do not in any way limit the scope of the invention.<br>
Those skilled in the art will recognize, or be able to ascertain using no more than routine<br>
experimentation, many equivalents to the specific embodiments and methods described<br>
herein. Such experiments are intended to be encompassed by the scope of the claims.<br>
Example I - Synthesis of Pepride-Based MR Imaging Agents:<br>
The peptide with linker-subunitmoiety bound to C-terminus (P-flinker-subunit<br>
moiety]). The unprotected peptide was prepared using standard Fmoc strategy and a<br>
diaminotrityl resin. The peptide was cyclized using thallium trifluoroacetate on the resin<br>
or in solution. After being cleaved from the resin, the unprotected peptide was purified by<br>

pentafluorophenol (1.2 eq.) in dichlorometnane was added PS-carbodiimide (1.2 -1.5<br>
eq.). The mixture was shaken for 3-5 h at room temperature. After LC-mass results<br>
indicated the reaction was complete, the resin was removed by filtration and the solvent<br>
was evaporated under reduced pressure to give the crude Linker Moiety (Boc-Dpr(Boc)-<br>
OPft (N-α-Boc-N-B-Boc-L-diaminopropionic acid pentafluorophenyl ester, 356-128) as a<br>
white foam.<br>

eq.) and the Linker Moiety {Boc-Dpr(Boc)-Opft} (2.2 eq.) in DMF was added DEPEA<br>
(4-6 eq.). The mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. After LC-mass results<br>
indicated the reaction was complete, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure.<br>
The crude product was then stirred in a mixture of TFA, water and anisole (90%/5%/5%)<br>
at room temperature for 3 h. Diethyl ether was added and a white precipitate formed,<br>

eq.) and pentafluorophenol (1.2 eq.) in dichloromethane was added PS-carbodiimide (1.2<br>
-1.5 eq.). The mixture was shaken for 3-5 h at room temperature. After LC-mass results<br>
indicated the reaction was complete, the resin was removed by filtration and the solvent<br><br>
was evaporated under reduced pressure to give the crude Precursor Chelate Moiety as a<br>
white foam.<br>
MR Imaging Agent To a solution of the Precursor MR Imaging Agent (1 eq.) and<br>
Precursor Chelate Moiety (4.0 eq.) in DMF was added DIPEA (4.0 eq.). The mixture was<br>
stirred overnight at room temperature. After LC-mass results indicated the reaction was<br>
complete, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure.<br>
The crude product was then stirred in a mixture of TFA, phenol, methylsulfonic<br>
acid, anisole and dichloromethane (90%/2.5%/2.5%/2.5%/2.5%) for 15 min. at room<br>
temperature. Diethyl ether was added and a white precipitate formed and was collected<br>
as the crude product.<br>
The crude product was reacted with GdCl3-H2O in deionized water to form the<br>
crude MR imaging agent, which was purified using RP-HPLC (C-l 8 column, Ethanol/ 50<br>
mmol AcONRO. Appropriate fractions were combined and the ethanol removed under<br>
reduced pressure, and then the combined fractions were treated with sodium acetate for<br>
salt exchange. After lyophilization the excess salts were removed using reverse-phase<br>
chromatography on a Waters Sep-Pak® C-l8 cartridge with water and ethanol:water<br>
(50:50) eluants. Appropriate fractions were combined, the ethanol removed under<br>
reduced pressure, and the solution was Iyopbilized to give the desired peptide MR<br>
imaging agent as a white solid.<br>
Similar methods were used to synthesize other MR imaging agents.<br><br><br><br><br>

trihydrochloride (25.15 g) (optically pure starting material: Syn Comm 29(14), 2377-<br>
2391 (1999), racemic starting material: Coll. Czech. Chem Comm. 34,630-634 (1969))<br>
was dissolved in a deionized water/1,4-dioxane mixture and the pH of the solution was<br>
adjusted to between 8 and 9 with aqueous sodium hydroxide. Di-tert-butyl dicarbonate<br>
(3.5 equiv.) was dissolved in dioxane and added between 10 and 20º C. The reaction<br>
mixture was stirred between 12 and 20 hours at room temperature. The reaction mixture<br>
was then diluted with water, and extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic extract was<br>
extracted sequentially with water, saturated sodium bicarbonate, and saturated sodium<br>
chloride solutions. The organic extract was dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and<br>

2566 (1999)]<br><br>
BOC-protected triamine (29.94 g) was dissolved in acetonitrile. Phosphate buffer,<br>
consisting of 21.6 g NaH2PO4,21.6 g Na2HPO4 and enough deionized water to produce a<br>
500 mL volume, was added (300 mL), followed by 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyl-l-oxy<br>
(TEMPO) (0.07 equiv.). The mixture was stirred vigorously and warmed to 35ºC.<br>
Sodium chlorite (2.0 equiv.) was dissolved in deionized water (100 mg/ml). The sodium<br>
chlorite solution and bleach (0.02 equiv., approx. 0.25% aqueous sodium hypochlorite)<br><br>
were added while maintaining a constant temperature. After addition of oxidant, the<br>
reaction was stirred for 24 hours. Additional TEMPO (0.07 equiv.) was added and the<br>
reaction mixture was stirred for 24 hours. The reaction was cooled to room temperature.<br>
Water was added and the pH was adjusted to 8 with 2.0 N aqueous NaOH. A cold<br>
solution of aqueous sodium sulfite was added (300 mL) while maintaining a constant pH.<br>
The solution was extracted with a small volume of methyl tert-butyl ether and set aside.<br>
The aqueous layer was acidified to pH 3-4 with 2.0 N aqueous HC1 and extracted with<br>
two small volumes of methyl tert-butyl ether. The organic extract was combined with the<br>
one previously set aside and concentrated in vacuo. The product was used without<br>
purification in Step 3 below. 1HNMR (300 MHz): 5.8 (bs, 1H), 5.3 (m, 1H), 4.4 (M, 1H),<br>

stirred under an inert atmosphere for 18 hours. The reaction mixture was diluted with<br>
water and extract twice with ethyl acetate. The organic layers were combined and<br>
washed sequentially with saturated sodium bicarbonate and sodium chloride solutions.<br>

was immediately dissolved in DMF and diisopropylamine (a sufficient amount to raise<br>
the pH to 8). tert-Butyl bromoacetate was added (12.0 equiv.). After the addition was<br>
complete, the reaction mixture was warmed to 50"C and stirred for 18 hours. Upon<br>
completion of reaction the volume of the reaction mixture was doubled by the addition of<br>
water, after which it was extracted twice with ethyl acetate. The organic extracts were<br>
combined and washed sequentially with water, saturated sodium bicarbonate, and<br>
saturated sodium chloride solutions. The organic solution was concentrated in vacuo to<br>

acetate/hexanes and purified by silica gel chromatography to provide the DTP A<br>
carboxylic acid penta-tert-butyl ester(yleld: 82%). MS (m/Z): 719.5 [MH]+. When this<br>
reagent is used in the synthesis of contrast agents using other chiral elements, no<br>
diastereomers are observed and therefore it is concluded that this material is essentially<br>
optically pure to the limit of detection by ordinary proton NMR.<br>

phosphate buffer (1.0 L, prepared by dissolving 100 mg of NaH2PO4 and 10 mg of<br>
Na2HPO4 into 1.0 mL of water and then adjusting the pH to 4.5 with H3PO4) and TEMPO<br>
(7.0 g) were combined and wanned to between 45 and 50°C. A solution consisting of<br>
sodium chlorite (29.8 g dissolved in 298 mL of water) and sodium hypochlorite (744 μL)<br>
was added to the solution while rnamtaining a temperature of 45 to 50°C. The reaction<br>
mixture was stirred vigorously for 4 to 10 hours. The reaction mixture was cooled to<br>
room temperature and two layers were separated. The organic layer was isolated and<br>
combined with saturated aqueous sodium chloride and stirred for 15 minutes. The<br>
organic layer was isolated and concentrated in vacuo to give an oil (171 g) which was<br>
purified by column chromatography using hexanedsopropanol with 0.1% triethylamine<br>
throughout to provide 81 g of enriched product as an oil. MS (m/Z): 719.5 [MH]+. The<br>
optical purity of material produced by this method did not differ from that above.<br><br>
Example 3 -Resins for Solid Phase Synthesis of Modified Peptides with C-terminal<br>
Amine Functional Groups<br>
The peptides have been prepared by solid-phase synthesis. In solid-phase<br>
synthesis, the linkers and resins are selected depending on the type of the peptides to be<br>
synthesized (e.g., the functional group required at the C-terminus, the protected or<br>
unprotected peptide) and the synthetic method to be used (e. g. Fmoc or BOC chemistry,<br>
manual or automated synthesis, the continuous flow or batch reactor). For example, in<br>
the synthesis of a peptide with a carboxylic group at the C-terminus, a protected-amino<br>
acid is attached to the different resins such as HMPB resins, 2-chlorotritylchloride resin<br>
and SUSRIN resin. On the other hand, in the synthesis of a peptide with an amino group<br>
at the C-terminus, a diamine can be attached to a trityl resin. The polystyrene (PS) resins<br>
can be used for batch synthesis, while polyethyleneglycol (PEG) modified resins are<br>
suitable for continuous flow and batch synthesis. Many trityl PS resins including 1,3-bis-<br>
(aminomethyl)-benzene trityl PS resin are commercially available. If the required trityl<br>
PS resin is not available, a similar procedure as described for PEG resins can be used to<br>
attach a diamine to a trityl PS resin.<br>
The synthesis of l,3-bis-(aminomethyl)-benzene trityl resin is discussed as an<br>
example. Other diamines can be attached to trityl resin in a similar manner.<br><br>
First, trityl alcohol resin (25 g, NovaSyn TGT resin, NovaBiochem) was placed in<br>
a funnel and washed sequentially with DMF, CH2Cl2, and toluene. After removing all<br>
solvent, the material was transferred to a flask equipped with a reflux condenser. Toluene<br>
(250 mL) and acetyl chloride (25 mL) were added and the slurry was heated to 70"C and<br>
stirred for 1.0 hour. An additional portion of acetyl chloride (25 ml) was added and the<br><br>
slurry was stirred for 2.0 hours at 70 ºC. The slurry was filtered and the resin washed<br>
sequentially with toluene and CH2Cl2.<br><br>
Second, freshly prepared trityl chloride resin and THF (250 mL) was placed in a<br>
flask. To the slurry was added l,3-bis-(aminornethyl)-benzene (10 eq., based on a resin<br>
substitution of 0.23 mmol/g) and the mixture was stirred for 18.0 hours at room<br>
temperature. The slurry was filtered and the resin was washed sequentially with water,<br>
DMF, CH2Cl2, methanol, and CH2Cl2. The resin was dried under vacuo (room<br>
temperature, 1-5 mm Hg) to a constant weight (25.4 g). The substitution stoichiometry<br>
was conducted using a quantitative ninhydrin procedure.<br><br><br>

DMF (5.0 ml) was added over 15 minutes at room temperature. The mixture was stirred<br>
for 18 hours, and then the mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate (100 ml) and water (50<br>
ml) and stirred for 15 minutes. The layers were separated and the organic layer was dried<br>
over sodium sulfate. The mixture was filtered, and the filtrate was concentrated under<br>

was filtered and rinsed with water and diethyl ether. The solid was dried by suction<br>
filtration, taken up in DMF and diluted with acetonitrile. The solution was cooled in an<br>
ice bath and was treated with 1.5g of thallium trifluoroacetate for 2.0 hours. The pH of<br>
the solution was adjusted with triemylamine to pH 8 and then concentrated under<br>
vacuum. Water was added to the oil and the resulting precipitate was collected by suction<br>
filtration. The solid was washed with water and diethyl ether to give 2.7 g of crude<br>
modified peptide having a C-tenninal amine functional group. An example synthesis of<br>
H2N-Leu-Pro-Cys-Asp-Tyr-Tyr-Gly-Thr-Cys-Bip-Asp-CO-NHCH2C6CH2NH2(SEQ<br>
ID NO:21) was confirmed by an observed m/Z of 1792.8 [M+Na]+. The modified peptide<br>
was purified by preparative HPLC. Fractions of similar purity (98-100%) were combined<br>
and lyophilized without neutralization.<br><br>
Modified peptide (3.2 g) and covalent conjugate (Synthon #2 above) (3.95 g) were<br>
dissolved in dichloromethane. Diisopropylethylamine was added dropwise until the pH<br>
measured 9, and diisopropylcarbodiimide (2 eq.) and HOBt (2 eq.) were added<br>
simultaneously to the mixture. After stirring 2 minutes, diisopropylethylamine-was added<br>
dropwise until the pH measured 9. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for two<br>
hours. Additional pre-activated Synthon #2 (with diisopropylcarbodiimide,<br>
diisopropylethylamine, and HOBt) was added in one portion. Solvents were removed in<br>
vacuo and the residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate, which was washed sequentially with<br>
0.1 N hydrochloric acid, saturated sodium bicarbonate, and saturated aqueous sodium<br>
chloride. The organic layer was dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated<br>
under reduced pressure to obtain a light yellow foam (7.8 g). The foam was dissolved in<br>
dichloromethane and purified by flash chromatography (dichloromethane: methanol<br>
eluent) to provide a white solid (5.6 g). The white solid was stirred in a mixture of TFA,<br>
water, and triethylsilane (90%/5%/5%, 30 ml) at room temperature. The mixture was<br>
heated to 40 *C and stirred for 2 hours. The solution was concentrated to a volume<br>
between 3-5 ml, then cooled to room temperature. Diethyl ether was added and a white<br>
precipitate formed. The mixture was allowed to stir for 10 minutes, and the solids were<br>
collected by filtration and washed with diethyl ether. The solids were dried under<br>
vacuum providing a white solid (4.0 g). The solid was dissolved in a mixture of water:<br>
acetonitrile (20 ml, 4:1 ratio) and purified by Prep HPLC to yleld a white solid, precursor<br>
MR imaging agent (1.6 g).<br>
Precursor MR imaging agent (1 g) was reacted with one equivalent of<br>
GdCl3•6H20 in distilled deionized water with the pH adjusted to ca. 6 by the addition of 1<br>
M NaOH. The gadolinium complex was purified by reverse phase chromatography<br>
(Waters Sep-Pak® C-18) using distilled deionized water and 50:50 (v:v) methanol .water<br>
eluent Appropriate fractions were combined and the methanol removed under reduced<br>
pressure at 50 °C and lyophilized to give 811 mg of the MR imaging agent.<br>
Alternatively to the synthesis of 32 presented above, the peptide may be cyclized<br>
on a resin as illustrated in the following Scheme:<br><br><br><br>
Example 6 - MR Imaging Agents Prepared in Analogous Fashion:<br>
Each of the following MR imaging agents was synthesized analogously to the<br>
methods described above. Peptide, prepared using standard Fmoc strategy and cyclized<br>
using thallium trifluoroacetate, was purified by HPLC and reacted with Synthon #2,<br>
diisopropylethylamine, diisopropylcarbodiimide (2 eq.) and HOBt (2 eq.) in<br>
dichloromethane. Solvents were removed in vacuo and the residue was dissolved in ethyl<br>
acetate, which was washed sequentially with 0.1 N hydrochloric acid, saturated sodium<br>
bicarbonate, and saturated aqueous sodium chloride. The organic layer was dried over<br>
sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure to obtain a foam which<br>
was purified if necessary by flash chromatography or HPLC. The resulting white solid<br>
was stirred in a mixture of TFA, water, and triethylsilane (90%/5%/5%, 30 ml) at room<br>
temperature for 2-6 hours. Diethyl ether was added and a white precipitate formed, which<br>
was purified by Prep HPLC (CH3CN/H2O/AcONH4) to yleld a white solid, precursor<br>
MR imaging agent<br>
Precursor MR imaging agent was reacted with one equivalent of GdCl3•6H2Oin<br>
deionized water (pH 6, NaOH). The gadolinium chelate was purified using reverse-<br>
phase chromatography on a Waters Sep-Pak® C-18 cartridge with water and<br>
methanol:water 50:50 eluant. Appropriate fractions were combined and the methanol<br>
removed under reduced pressure at 50 °C and lyophilized to give the desired MR imaging<br>
agent. Table 3 provides mass spectrometry data confirming each of the compounds. See<br>
the detailed description for the structure of each of the compounds.<br><br><br><br>
Example 7 - Synthesis of Fibrin-Binding Optical Contrast Agents:<br>
Each of the following optical contrast agents is synthesized analogously to the<br>
methods described above. Scheme X shows a general example wherein two identical<br>
optical dyes are added to the same peptide.<br>
5-Carboxvtetramethylrhodamine-containing compound (3A)<br>
The peptide 1 (177 mg, 0.10 mmol) and 5-carboxytetramethylrhodamine<br>
succinimidyl ester A (111 mg, 0.21 mmol) are dissolved in dichloromethane (20 mL) and<br>
DMF (20 mL). Diisopropylethylamine is added dropwise until the pH measures 9. The<br>
mixture is stirred for overnight and then the solvents are removed under reduced pressure.<br>
The residue is purified by silica-gel flash column chromatograph<br>
(eluants:dichloromethane/methanol) to give compound 2A.<br><br>
To compound 2A is added a solution of TFA, H2O and triethylsilane (ratio:<br>
90/5/5,5 mL). The mixture is shaken for 3 h at room temperature, and then the reaction<br>
mixture solution is poured into 50 mL of ether to precipitate the crude product After the<br>
solvents are separated by centrifugation, the crude product is collected and then purified<br>
using reverse-phase HPLC to obtain compound 3A.<br><br><br><br>
5-Carboxyfluoresceine-containing compound (3B)<br>
In a similar procedure as described in the synthesis of 3 A, 3B is synthesized using<br>
the peptide 1 (177 mg, 0.10 mmol) and 5-carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester B (99.4<br>
mg, 0.21 mmol).<br>
Texas Red®-X-containing compound (3C)<br>
In a similar procedure as described in the synthesis of 3A, 3C is synthesized using<br>
the peptide 1 (177 mg, 0.10 mmol) and Texas Red®-X succinimidyl ester C (172 mg,<br>
0.21 mmol).<br>
Example 8 - Measuring Binding of Contrast Agents to Targets:<br>
The extent of binding of a contrast agent according to the present invention to a<br>
target, such as HS A or fibrin, can be assessed by a variety of equilibrium binding<br>
methods. For example, binding to HS A can be measured by ultrafiltration. In a typical<br>
binding measurement using ultrafiltration, the contrast agent is mixed with 4.5%<br>
weight/volume HSA in a pH 7.4 buffer. The sample is loaded into a commercially<br>
available centrifugation apparatus equipped with a 30 kDa molecular weight cutoff filter<br>
(Millipore Ultrafree MC Low Binding Regenerated Cellulose 30 KDa mol. wt. cutoff<br>
catalog # UFC3LTK00), permeable to the targeting group, but not to HSA. A small<br>
portion (5 - 10%) of the sample volume is filtered by centrifugation at 2000 x g for 20<br>
min through the cutoff filter, and the concentration of unbound targeting group in the<br>
sample is measured in the filtrate.<br>
For measuring binding to fibrin, a fibrin clot may be formed in a well of a<br>
microtiter plate and contacted with the targeting group. After an incubation time<br>
sufficient to establish equilibrium, the supernatant is removed by aspiration (the insoluble<br>
fibrin remains bound as a gelled clot to the bottom of the well). The concentration of<br>
unbound targeting group in the supernatant is then measured.<br>
In both methodologies, the concentration of bound contrast agent is determined as<br>
the difference between the total targeting group concentration initially present and the<br>
unbound targeting group concentration following the binding assay. The bound traction<br><br>
is the concentration of bound targeting group divided by the concentration of total<br>
targeting group.<br>
Affinity of contrast agents to a soluble fibrin DD(E) fragment was examined as set<br>
forth above and is reported in Table 4. The compound numbers provided in Table 4 refer<br>
to the structures set forth in the detailed description. This data in multiple determinations<br>
has an error frequency of no more than 20% in this biological assay.<br><br><br><br>
Example 9 - Stability of Contrast Agents:<br>
Stability was assayed using rat liver homogenate, which contains both intra- and<br>
extracellular enzymes and represents a particularly harsh chemical environment for<br>
peptide bonds. Freshly prepared rat liver homogenate (630 μL) was placed in a glass test<br>
tube and incubated at 37 °C in a water bath for 4 minutes. To the rat liver homogenate at<br>
37 °C was added 70 μL of a 1 mM solution of test compound. At time points 0, 5,15,30,<br>
and 60 minutes, a 100 μL aliquot of the reaction mixture was removed and mixed with<br>
100 μL of methanol in a microfuge tube to quench the reaction. The quenched reaction<br>
mixture was centrifuged for 3 minutes at 10,000 rpm to pellet the precipitated protein.<br>
The supernatant was analyzed by LC-MS to quantitate the amount of test compound<br>
remaining by comparing the area of the single ion MS peak to that of a series of<br>
standards. Half life (Tl/2) was determined by plotting log percent signal remaining vs.<br>
time. The data were fit using an exponential curve fit, wherein Tl/2=ln2/slope.<br>
The stability data of the below compounds was tested. Compound 5, which has<br>
chelates at both the C- and N-termini of the peptide, had a dramatic increase in half-life<br>
resulting from resistance to exopeptidase hydrolysis. A comparable increase in half-life<br>
was not achieved through modification of one terminus with chelates, even when the<br>
other terminus was capped with an unnatural organic moiety as in, for example,<br>
compound 3 (containing a biphenyl group on the N-terminus).<br><br><br>
Structure 1: half-life = 
 <br>
Structure 2: half-life =10 min, N-tenninus conjugated to chelates and amidated C-<br>
terminus.<br><br>
Structure 3: half-life = 9 min, C-terminus conjugated to chelates and N-terminus<br>
acylated with para-(phenyl)benzoic acid.<br><br>
Structure 5: half-life = 65 min, both N- and C-termini conjugated to chelates.<br>
Surprisingly, the above data illustrate that the half-life of a peptide is most<br>
significantly increased by the addition of gadolinium chelates to both the C- and the N-<br>
termini.<br>
Example 10 - Relaxivity of Contrast Agents<br>
The MRI contrast agents of the present invention were evaluated for relaxivity<br>
using a Bruker NMS-120 Minispec NMR spectrometer operating at 0.47 Tesla (20 MHz<br>
H-1Larmor frequency) and 37°C or a Konig-Brown relaxameter (20 MHz, H-l Larmor<br>
frequency) operating at 35ºC. T1 of water protons was determined by an inversion<br><br>
recovery pulse sequence using fee instrument's software. Relaxivity was determined by<br>
measuring the Tl of multiple solutions of the target (for example, homodisperse gels of<br>
freshly polymerized fibrinogen, 10 mg/mL) containing zero, 20,30, and 40 μM Gd(III),<br>
respectively. The samples are incubated at 37ºC for at least 15 minutes to ensure<br>
temperature equilibration before the Tl measurement is performed The Gd(III) content<br>
of the samples is determined by inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometry (ICP-<br>
MS). The relaxivity (per Gd(III) ion) is determined by plotting the relaxation rate (1/T1)<br>
in s-1 versus the Gd(III) concentration in mM. The slope of a linear fit to the data gives<br>
the relaxivity. The relaxivity of the compounds in the absence of target is also<br>
determined in an analogous manner, except there is no target present<br>
Compounds of the invention show increased relaxivity upon binding to fibrin<br>
(FIG. 2) as compared with the relaxivity in the absence of biological target<br>
Example 11 - Clot uptake of contrast agents<br>
The uptake of a contrast agent into a thrombus (blood clot) was determined by the<br>
following method: A 600 g guinea pig (Hartley male) was anaesthetized. An incision<br>
was made in the abdomen and the inferior vena cava (TVC) isolated and the vessel was<br>
allowed to recover for 10 minutes. A 1 cm portion of the IVC was clamped and human<br>
thrombin (50 μL, 4 units) was injected into the vessel to promote thrombus formation.<br>
The lower clamp was opened and closed allowing partial blood flow to the segment.<br>
After 2-3 minutes the clips were removed. The thrombus was allowed to age in the<br>
animal for 30 minutes. At this point the contrast agent, compound 32 at a dose of 2<br>
umol/kg and trace radiolabeled with 70 μCi of 111In, was injected via the jugular vein.<br>
Immediately following injection of agent compound 32, a non-specific control<br>
comprising Gd(DTPA)at a dose of 2 umol/kg mixed with 70 μCi 99mTcDTPA was<br>
injected via the jugular vein. After 30 minutes blood was drawn, the animal sacrificed,<br>
and the thrombus removed. The blood sample was weighed and counted using a Packard<br>
Cobra II gamma counter. The thrombus was also weighed and counted. Counts arising<br>
from 99mTc were detected from 128-165 keV while counts arising from the decay of 111In<br>
were detected from 390 - 500 keV. Control experiments with only 99mTo or 111In<br>
demonstrated radioactivity arising from 99mTc was negligible at detection energies used<br><br>
for In and vice versa. The radioactive decay data were converted to % initial dose per<br>
gram of tissue, %ID/g, and the mean of three experiments is presented graphically.<br>
Radiolabeling with 111m was performed in advance: An appropriate radiochemical<br>
amount of 111InCl3 (New England Nuclear) was added to the fibrin targeted contrast<br>
agent The pH was adjusted to 4 by addition of 1 M HC1. The sample was heated at 45°C<br>
for 1 hour. The pH was adjusted to neutral by addition of 1 M NaOH. The labeled agent<br>
compound 32 was &gt; 95% pure by y-detected HPLC.<br>
Fibrin-specific agents show a marked increase in clot uptake. FIG. 3 shows that<br>
an agent, compound 32, is accumulating in the thrombus. There is specific clot uptake<br>
compared to 99mTcDTPA and there is a higher concentration of the agent in the thrombus<br>
than in the surrounding blood.<br>
Specificity of clot uptake also can be demonstrated using MRI. The procedure for<br>
in vivo imaging of a thrombus with an agent is as follows: A 600 g guinea pig (Hartley<br>
male) is anaesthetized. An incision is made in the throat and one of the jugular veins<br>
isolated. A1 cm section of the jugular vein is isolated with vascular clamps. Freshly<br>
drawn blood from the animal (50 μL) is mixed with human thrombin (50 μL, 4 units) and<br>
is injected into the clamped segment of the vein. Four minutes after injection, the clamps<br>
are removed and the thrombus is allowed to age for 30 minutes. Agent, compound 32, is<br>
injected at a dose of 6 umol/kg and the throat area of the guinea pig is imaged at 1.5 T<br>
using a spoiled gradient method TR=36, TE=5, flip angle = 30°. The thrombus appears<br>
bright relative to the blood.<br>
Example 12 - Obtaining an MR image of a thrombus with a targeted contrast agent<br>
with and without black blood:<br>
A 2.5 kg female New Zealand White rabbit was anesthetized with a cocktail of<br>
Ketamine (50mg/kg), Aceapromazine (2.5mg/kg), and Rompon (5mg/kg) and anesthesia<br>
maintained with sodium pentobarbital (approx.35mg/kg as needed). An i.v. catheter<br>
(24g) was placed into the ear vein and the ear artery. The jugular vein and carotid artery<br>
were isolated. A stenosis was created in the carotid artery by placing an 18g needle on<br>
top of the vessel and then suturing it into place with 3-0 suture. The needle was then<br>
removed. A 5 mm portion of the artery was then segmented off distally to the stenosis<br><br>
with microvascular clips. The artery was then crashed twice along the 5mm section. The<br>
proximal vascular clip was released to allow blood flow into the section for ca. 3 sec.<br>
The clip was reapplied and artery was crashed twice again along the 5mm section. After<br>
4 minutes, the clips were removed. A 5 mm segment of the jugular vein was isolated<br>
with microvascular clips. A thrombus was created by injecting 100 μL of a 3.7 units of<br>
thrombin, 0.06 M CaCl2, rabbit whole blood mixture. After 4 minutes, the clips were<br>
removed.<br>
The thrombi were allowed to age for 50 minutes. A 1.0 mL solution of the<br>
thrombus targeted agent (Structure m, 5 mM, 2 μmol/kg) was administered via the ear<br>
vein. After 10 minutes, the animal was placed inside a General Electric Signa LxCVi 1.5<br>
tesla scanner and a first MRI data set was obtained using a 3D RF spoiled gradient echo<br>
sequence (SPGR: TR = 39 ms, TE = 3.1 ms, flip angle = 40 degrees, field of view = 8 cm,<br>
acquisition bandwith = 31.25 kH). Chemical fat saturation was applied as well as 40 mm<br>
spatial inferior and superior saturation bands. Immediately following this scan (8 minutes<br>
later), a second MRI data set was acquired using the same parameters with the addition of<br>
40 mm spatial inferior and superior saturation bands to generate a "black blood" image.<br>
FIG. 4A shows the maximum intensity projection (MIP) of the first data set. The<br>
blood vessels are partially enhanced from time of flight effects. FIG. 4B shows the MTP<br>
of the second data set where the signal from in-flowing blood was suppressed (black<br>
blood) by the use of superior and inferior saturation bands. In FIG. 4A and 4B, the<br>
identification of the stationary target (a thrombus) through use of the targeted contrast<br>
agent is clearly facilitated.<br>
Example 13 - Synthesis of an optical contrast agent:<br>
NovaSyn TGR resin (0.20 mmol/g, 100 mg, 20 umol) was washed with<br>
NMP/ether/NMP. The peptide was assembled by the standard solid phase method using<br>
the PyBOP/HOBt/DIEA activation. After the coupling of the final amino acid residue, the<br>
resin bound peptide was treated with a solution of piperidine in DMF (20% by volume,<br>
2.0 mL) for 10 minutes to remove the Fmoc protecting group. The resin was washed<br>
thoroughly with NMP/ether/NMP, and was treated with a solution of fluorascein-5-<br>
isothiocyanate (23.4 mg, 60 μmol) and dusopropylethylamine (11.6 mg, 15.7 uL, 90<br><br>
μnol) in DMF (1.5 mL) for 12 hours. The resin was washed thoroughly<br>
(NMP/ether/NMP), and treated with a solution of T1(TFA)3 (18.7 mg, 34.5 umol) in DMF<br>
(1.5 mL) at 4 "C for three hours. The resin was washed after this treatment, and treated<br>
with a cocktail of TFA/TIS/water (95/2.5/2.5,2.0 mL) for two hours. The crude peptide<br>
was precipitated by adding ether to the cleavage cocktail, and purified by preparative<br>
HPLC using a Vydac C-l 8 column. Structures A-N were formed in this manner and their<br>
fibrin DD(E) fragment affinities were determined (Table 5).<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
N-terminal labeling of the peptides with optical probes can modulate the binding<br>
affinity of the optical contrast agents. For example, when comparing fluorescein, 4-<br>
methoxycoumarin and tetramethylrhodamine derivatives of the peptide<br>
(QWECPYGLCWIQ (SEQ ID NO:27); Kd=3 uM) the following Kd's were observed<br>
(Table 6):<br><br>
Example 14 - Fibrin targeted urokinase:<br>
Fibrin targeted urokinase is prepared according to the following procedure. A<br>
fibrin binding peptide with a Gly-Gly dipeptide linker is prepared according to solid<br>
phase procedures. The N-terminus of the peptide is blocked with an acetyl group, and the<br>
C-terminal carboxylic acid is converted to a succinamidal active ester. Direct chemical<br><br>
ligation is achieved by mixing urokinase and the activated peptide in appropriate<br>
proportions in an aqueous buffer and gently agitating the solution for 30 miniutes<br><br>
Fibrin targeted urokinase can be purified by HPLC. Binding to fibrin can be<br>
assessed. Compound 1 binds fibrin selectively versus fibrinogen.<br>
The rabbit jugular vein model of Collen et al. (J. Clin. Invest. 1983,71,368-376)<br>
is used for thrombolysis assays. Compound (2 mg/kg) is administered by infusion of a<br>
bolus (consisting of 20% of the total dose) over 1 min, along with a heparin bolus (300<br>
units/kg) over 1 min. The remainder of the dose is continuously infused over the next 60<br>
min, and heparin (60 units/kg/hr) is continuously infused over the next 180 min. At 3<br>
hours, the animals are sacrificed, and clots analyzed. Compound 1 is more potent in clot<br>
lysis than scuPA alone. At 3 hr, with 2 mg/kg of compound 1, there is less consumption<br>
of fibrinogen and α2-antiplasmin, relative to equivalent doses of scuPA alone,<br>
demonstrating that compound 1 was more fibrin specific than scuPA alone.<br><br>
