				<td>The Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to the further improvement in the style of cigarette packing in 2,4 or 5, in counting and bearing in itself the facility of matchstick with friction or rubbing on the carbonated area simultaneously.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Smoking is one of the oldest habits of the mankind since ages, which conventionally comprises only the packing, which consists of 10.20 or more cigarettes packing and with no added facility of ignition. Lots of the invention and researches with regards to the improvement in the smoking regime had taken place, which reveals after intensive, thorough examination of bibliography relating to the smoking composition etc.<br>
Object of the Invention<br>
Since the beginning of the era of smoking (Cigarette) the user are facing very embarrassing situations. Lacs of people who smoke are not satisfied with the conventional and traditional availability of cigarette in its present shape and quantity. Cigarette is not provided to them in a real and proper manner. Most of the smokers are of the willingness that they should be provided the cigarette in 2, 4 and 5 packing. Rather than, that only one style of packing<br><br>
consisting of 10,20 or more cigarette packing available, at present only. Furthermore the packing of cigarette of 2, 4,5, 10 and 20 should be attached with the facility of firing place of friction with matchsticks in its in built process.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Many smokers sometimes feel its prudent to purchase 2,4,5 cigarette so that to facilitate themselves. But they could not get the same from the market at present in their desirable quantity of cigarette. Normally, these all smokers use a single cigarette at a time. Rest of them they keep in their pocket to use, as and when they intend to smoke another one cigarette and that time it is often found that the cigarette are in broken or banded shape, since these are being kept in their pocket in loose, without having safety cover which is required to be. Even then sometime they have to throw these all cigarette unused, the reasons being so, that they are broken or in such a situation which are not fit for smoking.<br>
It has been observed that most of the smokers have to face a situation like beggar for so many times in their life, merely reason being so, that they have no match box or gas lighter in their pocket to give fire to the cigarette and sometime they have match box or gas lighter in their pocket but they did not have cigarette in their packets, because of inadequate combination of matchsticks, matchbox and with cigarette packing.<br><br>
this invention would benefit to the substantive amount of person relating to smoking categories by using these methods and techniques. The smoking segment at large shall be get rid of matchbox and gas lighter and further more they will be in position to buy the cigarette in their desirable packing as of 2,4 and 5 with its in built area of having matchsticks in sufficient amount and a place of friction side by. This all requires very jew and simple changes in the manufacturing of cigarette boxes, which contains cigarettes.<br>
Although the packing of cigarette in counts of 3,6,7 and 8 are also achievable, in the same manner as envisaged m the present invention, but the packing capacity of 2,4 and 5 are the most desirable in the present scenario of market with the added provisions of matchsticks duly pasted or simply inserted in the chambers as shown in the drawings. The provisions of 20 matchsticks for the cigarette packet for containing 10 cigarettes can also be achieved in a same manner. The positioning of two layers containing 10 matchsticks each can simply be pasted gum or inserted in the extra chamber duly meant for this specific purpose Similarly, 40 matchsticks can be laid down accordingly for the cigarette packets containing 20 cigarettes.<br>
Similarly, the various sizes of length of cigarette such as from 48mm (the size of matchstick) to 100mm in various counts of<br><br>
packing can be made available to the largest society of smokers segments.<br>
Clearly due to a simple reason that the combination of match sticks and cigarette is not maintained, as it is required to be. The second and the serious problems which the smokers of cigarette are facing that they are not getting desirable quantity of cigarette in it individual packing with match sticks facility for firing the cigarette<br>
The invention is design for its utility in a manner and style of perfect combination of matchsticks and place for friction with the cigarette packs containing the quantity of cigarettes in 2, 4 and 5,<br>
With a view to achieve above, amongst other object of the present invention, the invention provides user friendly and convenient techniques of packing of cigarette with adequate combination of cigarette and matchsticks in its in built process which cover both of these in a one single unit.<br>
The invention simply does not helps to the persons of smokers category rather than that its serves the whole society at large. If matchsticks are provided with cigarette in built area, that means savings of thousands of trees which are being axed for the purpose of manufacturing of match boxes and cigarette packing causing the life of lots of trees. It is a well-known factor of present scenario that how serious our life is depends upon the trees, this invention<br><br>
preserves the wastage of matchsticks and matchboxes in abandoned.<br>
A substantive amount of wood in shape of tree can be saved if the said invention put into general practice, for instance four matchsticks are enough for the cigarette packets containing of 2 cigarettes only, Similarly eight matchsticks are enough for the ignition a cigarette packets containing four cigarettes only. Similarly, ten matchsticks are enough for the cigarette packet containing of five cigarettes only. Contrary to that, if we draw our attention to the prevalent practice of matchbox duly used for the purpose of ignition of the cigarette, is of too high.<br>
By the virtue of this invention, the smokers do not have any need to purchase any matchbox or gas lighter for the purpose of ignition to the cigarette.<br>
In connection with this, the exact size and configuration of the packing is highly important and can easily be determined by the man of ordinary skills.<br>
Normally, a smoker has to carry a matchbox or gas lighter in his pocket. This particular invention shall make him feel easy and the problem of carrying one extra unit in shape of matchbox or gas lighter in his pocket will be removed.<br><br>
I he current invention sets out to overcome these problems, which may be experienced with current smoking regimes.<br>
The process of manufacturing as envisaged in embodiment is currently available having already available materials and with the helps of conventional techniques of manufacturing and processing of the cigarette manufacturing and packing etc.<br>
This particular invention is supposed to serve the other most desirable features also.<br>
Keeping in view the economics aspects of this invention, it is highly admirable and quite profitable for user, trader and manufacturer. How lessor matchsticks are used, by applying the method and process of above preferred invention, the same amount of various taxes such as excise duty, sale tax, center sale tax, income tax and local tax etc. shall be downed. The smokers will have to pay comparatively fewer amounts for the consumption of same quantity of cigarette, which they are investing presently. Similarly the manufacturer and traders will have to pay less amount of excise duty, sale tax, center sale tax, income tax and local tax etc. as applicable to them, without effecting their profits. Hence, the present invention is equally beneficial to everyone who is concerned with smoking, in what so manner, whether directly or indirectly. Furthermore, we can preserve jungles more effectively,<br><br>
which are immensely required in the interest of whole of the mankind.<br>
It is also sometime observed that these unclaimed matchboxes which are being left half used, may come upon in the hands of children and they treat the matchboxes as a tool of toy, which may cause of fire, resulting very huge loss in shape of valuable lives and properties.<br>
The matchsticks shown in various drawings can be placed on semi-drysemi-wet gum/paste either or can be simply inserted by providing 2mm extra space in the cigarette packet.<br>
The present invention is easily understandable to a person of an ordinary skill pertaining to manufacturing, trading and users segments.<br>
