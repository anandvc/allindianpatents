SPECIFICATION Stable Vitamin B6 Derivative<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a stable vitamin B6 derivative.<br>
Background Art<br>
Each of pyridoxine, pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine is a substance having vitamin B6 action, and referred to as a class of vitamin B6 together with each 5'-phosphate thereof i.e., pyridoxine 5'-phosphate, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, and pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate. These compounds are metabolized to give pyridoxal 5'-phosphate in vivo, and play an important role as a coenzyme for enzymes involved in amino acid metabolism.<br>
It is known that pyridoxine and hydrochloride thereof are extremely unstable to light, and similarly, pyridoxal, pyridoxamine, and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate are also very unstable to light. For this reason, it is desired to provide a compound of the vitamin B6 class that has improved light stability.<br>
Several vitamin B6 glycosides in which vitamin B6 is glycosylated have been reported. For example, pyridoxine 5'- β -D-glucoside exists in plant bodies. However, light stability thereof has not been reported. Vitamin B6 glycosides glycosylated at the 4'- or 5' position (pyridoxine 4'- α -D-glucoside, pyridoxine 5'- α -D-glucoside) were enzymatically synthesized (for example, J. Vitaminol., 15, pp. 160-166, 1969; and Methods in Enzymology, 280, pp.66'71, 1997). As for the stability of pyridoxine 4'- α -D-glucoside, and pyridoxine 5' a -D-glucoside, it has been reported that these substances have superior long term stability at 50oC in pharmaceutical preparations compared with pyridoxine hydrochloride (for example, Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication (KOKAI) Nos. 2002-265316 and 2002-265368). As for light stability, it has been reported that light stability of a mixture of pyridoxine 4'- α -D-glucoside and pyridoxine 5'- α  -D-glucoside is improved compared with pyridoxine hydrochloride under an ultraviolet lamp irradiation test (for example, J. Vitaminol., 17, pp.121-124, 1971). However, the reported stability is not sufficient for practical applications. No compound has been reported so far .in which vitamin B6 is glycosylated at the 3-position and esterified into phosphoric acid ester.<br>
It is known that light stability of vitamin B6 is improved by addition of boric acid<br><br>
(Vitamins, 22, pp,138-141, 1961) or addition of a sugar alcohol (Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication (KOKAI) No. 07-20664). However, the effect is not satisfactory, and moreover, a problem arises that the use is limited by the addition of boric acid or a sugar alcohol.<br>
It is known that when vitamin B6 is mixed with other class of vitamins, decomposition of the other vitamins may sometimes be accelerated. For example, it has been reported that when calcium pantothenate and vitamin B6 are mixed and stored at 40°C under 75% RH, decomposition of calcium pantothenate is accelerated (Katei-yaku Kenkyu (Home Remedy Research), 54(5), pp.54"58, 1986). It is known that in an aqueous solution added with boric acid, both of vitamin B6 and pantothenic acid can stably exist (Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication (KOKAI) No. 05-17355). However, the effect is not satisfactory, and a problem arises that the use is limited by the addition of boric acid.<br>
Vitamin B6 is a vitamin that plays an important role for protein metabolism in vivo, and also acts as a coenzyme in metabolism of fats. Shortage of vitamin causes skin inflammation, swelling, psilosis and the like (Fragrance Journal, 17 (3), 96-100 (1986); Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication (KOKAI) No. 2002-265368). As dermal external preparations, external preparations added with a vitamin B6 derivative such as pyridoxine hydrochloride have conventionally been used for relief of skin roughness, pimple, sun tanning, and hot flush by snow burning, therapeutic and prophylactic treatments of itching due to inflammation, dandruff due to seborrhea sicca and the like. However, vitamin B6 derivatives conventionally used have problems that they have poor light stability, and decomposition products thereof cause skin irritation and the like. They also have a problem that sufficient effects as vitamin B6 cannot be obtained when they are added and used in skin external preparations.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The instability of vitamin B6 and derivatives thereof, especially the instability to light, is an obstacle for practical use of these substances. If a vitamin B6 derivative that is stable to light can be provided, the derivative will successfully expand utilities thereof. Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a stable vitamin B6 derivative. In particular, the object of the present invention is to provide a vitamin B6 derivative having improved stability against light.<br>
The inventors of the present invention conducted various researches to achieve<br><br>
the aforementioned object. As a result, they found that a vitamin B6 derivative having a particular structure in which vitamin B6 was glycosylated or made into phosphoric acid or sulfuric acid ester (hereinafter also referred to as a "vitamin B6 derivative") at the 3-position had superior stability, and especially the stability thereof against light was remarkably improved. The inventors of the present invention further conducted researches, and found a novel compound useful as an intermediate for manufacture of the aforementioned vitamin B6 derivative, and an efficient method for producing the aforementioned vitamin B6 derivative using the aforementioned intermediate. The inventors of the present invention also found that the aforementioned vitamin B6 derivative was stably maintained in a composition such as medicaments, foodstuffs, feeds, cosmetics and the like to exhibit superior effects, and the derivative gave no influence on the stability of other vitamins in the composition. They further found that the aforementioned vitamin B6 derivative had remarkable advantageous effects, in particular, whitening effect, anti-aging effect, wrinkle suppressing effect and the like. The present invention was achieved on the basis of the aforementioned findings.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention<br>
R1 represents a glycosyl group, a phosphate group, or a cyclic phosphate group bound to R2. In the specification, the term "glycosyl group" means a residue obtained by removing hydroxyl group of the 1-position of a saccharide compound (2-position for fructose). The anomer type of the ether linkage between the glycosyl group represented by R1 and the pyridine ring may be either α or β type, or a mixture thereof. The type of the saccharide compound constituting the glycosyl group is not particularly limited, and may be, for example, a monosaccharide, or any of oligosaccharides including disaccharides, trisaccharides, tetrasaccharides, and larger oligosaccharides. The stereochemistry of the saccharide compound may be any of D-, L-, or a mixture thereof. Examples of the saccharide compound constituting the glycosyl group include, for example, D*glucose, Lr glucose, D-galactose, Lrgalactose, D-mannose, L-mannose, D-fructose, Lrlructose, D-ribose, Lrribose, D-xylose, Lrxylose, D-arabinose, L-arabinose, D-talose, Lrtalose, D-lyxose, L-lyxose, D-allose, L-allose, D-altrose, Lraltrose, D-gulose, L-gulose, D-idose, L"idose, D-quinovose, L-quinovose, D-rhamnose, L-rhamnose, D-fucose, L-fiicose, maltose, cellobiose, lactose, maltotriose and the like. Among them, D-glucose and D-galactose are preferred.<br>
The phosphate group represented by R1 may be any of linear esters such as monophosphate, pyrophosphate, and tripolyphosphate, cyclic esters formed with monophosphate, pyrophosphate, tripolyphosphate, or the like of R2, or a mixture of the both.<br>
R2 represents -CH2OH, -CHO, -CH2NH2, -CH2-amino acid residue, or -CH2-OPO2H. The -CH2-amino acid residue represented by R2 means a group consisting of an amino acid of which amino terminus is bound to -CH2- When an asymmetric carbon atom of an amino acid exists, the compound may be either an optically active substance or a racemate. Examples of the amino acid compound constituting the amino acid group include, for example, acidic amino acids such as glutamic acid, aspartic acid, cysteic acid,<br><br>
and homocysteic acid, neutral amino acids such as glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, threonine, serine, homoserine, tyrosine, cysteine, methionine, asparagine, and glutamine, and basic amino acids such as lysine, ornithine, arginine, and histidine. Among them, Lrserine is preferred.<br>
The protective groups in R4, R5, and R6 can be suitably chosen by those skilled in the art. For example, protective groups suitable for hydroxyl group, amino group, aldehyde group and the like, and introduction or elimination methods for these groups are described in, for example, Theodora W. Green ed., "Protective Groups in Organic Syntheses", John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1999; "Handbook of Regents for Organic Synthesis", four volumes in total, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1999) and the like. Therefore, those skilled in the art can easily choose an appropriate protective group, and perform introduction and elimination of the protective group.<br>
The compounds represented by the aforementioned general formula (I) or (IV) can form a salt. Examples of pharmacologically acceptable salts include, for example, mineral acid salts such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulfate, nitrate, and phosphate, organic acid salt such as methanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, para-toluenesulfonate, acetate, propionate, tartrate, fumarate, maleate, malate, oxalate, succinate, citrate, benzoate, mandelate, cinnamate, and lactate. When an acidic group exists, examples of the salts include, for example, metal salts such as lithium salt, sodium salt, potassium salt, magnesium salt, and calcium salt, and ammonium salts such as ammonium salt, methylammonium salt, dimethylammonium salt, trimethylammonium salt, and dicyclohexylammonium salt. They may form a salt with an amino acid such as glycine.<br>
The compounds represented by the aforementioned general formula (I) or (IV) may also exist as a hydrate or a solvate. The compounds represented by the aforementioned general formula (I) or (IV) have one or more asymmetric carbons, and accordingly, they may exist as a stereoisomer such as an optically active substance and a diastereomer. Any of stereoisomers in a pure form, arbitrary mixtures of optical enantiomers or diastereomers, racemates and the like fall within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Preferred examples of the compounds of the present invention represented by the aforementioned general formula (I) include, for example, pyridoxine 3-β -glucoside, pyridoxine 3-α-glucoside,<br><br>
pyridoxamine 3- β -glucoside,<br>
pyridoxamine 3- α -glucoside,<br>
pyridoxal 3- β -glucoside,<br>
pyridoxal 3- α -glucoside,<br>
pyridoxine 3- β -galactoside,<br>
pyridoxine 3- α -galactoside,<br>
N-(4-pyridoxylmethylene)-L-serine 3- β -glucoside,<br>
N-(4-pyridoxylmethylene)-L-serine 3- α -glucoside,<br>
pyridoxine 3-phosphate,<br>
pyridoxine 3,4'-cyclic phosphate,<br>
N-(4-pyridoxylmethylene)-L-serine 3-phosphate and the like. Preferred examples also<br>
include D-isomers of these compounds. However, the compounds of the present invention<br>
are not limited to these examples.<br>
The glycoside compounds of the present invention represented by the general formula (I) can be prepared according to, for example, the following reaction scheme. R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, and X in the formula have the same meanings as those mentioned above. The following reaction scheme indicates a method of preparing a compound represented by the general formula (IV) having one or more protective groups (Step A) and removing the protective groups in Step B (therefore, at least one of the groups selected from the group consisting of R4, R5, and R6 has a protective group). When two or more protective groups are present, the deprotection in Step B is performed by a step of removing the protective groups stepwise, or a step of simultaneously removing all the protective groups. However, the method for preparing the compounds of the present invention represented by the general formula (I) is not limited to the following method. Further, the scope of the compounds of the present invention represented by the general formula (I) is not limited to those prepared by the following method.<br><br>
First, a compound represented by the general formula (II) and a compound<br><br>
represented by the general formula (III) are subjected to a glycosylation reaction to prepare a compound represented by the general formula (IV).

Test Example 17 (test for melanin production suppression and cell survival rate in cultured cells)<br>
Cultured mouse B16 melanoma cells were used. An appropriate amount of MEM medium containing 10% FBS was added to wells of two 6-well plates, and the B16 melanoma cells were inoculated, and incubated at 37oC with 5 volume % CO2. On the next<br><br>
day, a sample-containing solution was added so that the medium contained the vitamin B6 derivative (pyridoxine 3- β-D-glucoside or pyridoxine 3- 0 -D-glucoside hydrochloride) at a final solid concentrations shown in Fig. 20, and then mixed. On the 5th day of the culture, the medium was exchanged, and the sample-containing solution was again added. On the next day, the medium was removed, and for one plate, the cells were washed with phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), and then collected. Then, whitening degree of the cultured B16 melanoma cells was evaluated according to the criteria mentioned below by using 100 μ g/ml kojic acid as a control. The results are shown in the following tables. In the tables, + means "whitening effect comparable to that of the control", ± means "whitening effect a little weaker than that of the control", X means "no effect", and "-" means that test was not performed. The cell growth rate is indicated with a relative ratio based on that of the control, which is taken as 100%.<br><br>
From the results shown in the tables, it is clearly understood that the vitamin B6 derivatives (pyridoxine 3- β -D-glucoside and pyridoxine 3-β -D-glucoside hydrochloride) exhibited superior suppressing effect on melanin production.<br>
Test Example 18 (test for evaluating melanin production suppression by combination with whitening agent)<br>
Cultured mouse B16 melanoma cells were used. A vitamin B6 derivative (pyridoxine 3- β -D-glucoside) and arbutin (Wako Pure Chemical Industries) dissolved in purified water at given concentrations were each added to the medium at a concentration of 100 μ M. With exchanges of the medium during the culture, the cells were cultured for<br><br>
5 days, and then collected. The cell number was counted, and then intracellular melanin was quantified. As a control added with a solvent, the medium added with purified water was used. Based on the amount of the melanin observed for the control added with the solvent, which was taken as 1, the relative amount of intracellular melanin observed for each sample concentration was considered a melanin production ratio. The results are shown in Fig. 20.<br>
It was demonstrated that the vitamin B6 derivative (pyridoxine 3- β -D-glucoside) combined with the other whitening ingredient exhibited superior suppressing effect on melanin production. From the results mentioned above, it was concluded that the vitamin B6 derivative successfully exhibits more excellent whitening effect by combination with another whitening ingredient.<br>

diethylenetriaminepentaacetate (DETAPAC) solution were each dissolved in a base (polyethylene glycol looo(ethyl alcohol = 1:1) to prepare samples at a concentration of 2%, and the samples were used for the skin evaluation test using ultraviolet irradiation on hairless mice. DETAPAC was used as a positive control. [Sample application method and ultraviolet irradiation method]<br>
Mice (10-week old) in each group consisting of 8 mice were applied with each of the aforementioned samples on the back 90 minutes before ultraviolet irradiation, and irradiated with ultraviolet rays of a fixed quantity (Toshiba FL20 S-BLB lamp) for 2 hours (5 times/week) over ten weeks to examine suppressing effect on wrinkle formation.<br>
Ultraviolet absorption spectra of the samples were measured to confirm that the samples had no influence on the evaluation test. [Evaluation method] (Suppressing effect on wrinkle formation)<br>
Wrinkle formation after the ultraviolet irradiation oβen weeks was graded in accordance with the "skin photoaging grades" mentioned below. The results were indicated as averages of the scores for eight mice. The test and evaluation methods used<br><br>
were modified from those described in the article by Bissett et al. (Photochem. Photobiol., Volume: 46, Issue: 3, Page: 367-78, Year: 1987).<br><br>
