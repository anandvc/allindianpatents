FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to scroll-type machines. More particularly, the<br>
present invention relates to a horizontal scroll-type compressor with an improved<br>
lubrication system for providing lubricating oil from the discharge pressure zone to the oil<br>
passage in the crankshaft.<br>
BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Scroll machines in general, and particularly scroll compressors, are often disposed in a<br>
hermetic shell which defines a chamber within which is disposed a working fluid. A<br>
partition within the shell often divides the chamber into a discharge pressure zone and a<br>
suction pressure zone. In a low-side arrangement, a scroll assembly is located within the<br>
suction pressure zone for compressing the working fluid. Generally, these scroll assemblies<br>
incorporate a pair of intermeshed spiral wraps, one or both of which are caused to orbit<br>
relative to the other so as to define one or more moving chambers which progressively<br>
decrease in size as they travel from an outer suction port towards a center discharge port.<br>
An electric motor is normally provided which operates to cause this relative orbital<br>
movement.<br>
The partition within the shell allows compressed fluid exiting the center discharge port of<br>
the scroll assembly to enter the discharge pressure zone within the shell while<br>
simultaneously maintaining the integrity between the discharge pressure zone and the<br>
suction pressure zone. This function of the partition is normally accomplished by a seal<br>
which interacts with the partition and with the scroll member defining the center discharge<br>
port.<br>
The discharge pressure zone of the hermetic shell is normally provided with a discharge<br>
fluid port which communicates with a refrigeration circuit or some other type of fluid<br>
circuit. In a closed system, the opposite end of the fluid circuit is connected with the<br>
suction pressure zone of the hermetic shell using a suction fluid port extending through the<br>
shell into the suction pressure zone. Thus, the scroll machine receives the working fluid<br>
from the suction pressure zone of the hermetic shell, compresses the working fluid in the<br><br>
one or more moving chambers defined by the scroll assembly, and then discharges the<br>
compressed working fluid into the discharge pressure zone of the compressor. The<br>
compressed working fluid is directed through the discharge port through the fluid circuit<br>
and returns to the suction pressure zone of the hermetic shell through the suction port.<br>
Typically, scroll-type compressors have been designed as either a vertical or a horizontal<br>
scroll compressor. The horizontal configuration may be necessitated due to space<br>
constraints in the application in which the scroll compressor is to be employed. A primary<br>
difference between the vertical and horizontal scroll compressor designs stems from the<br>
fact that the lubrication sump and delivery systems have needed to be specifically adapted<br>
for a vertical or horizontal configuration. The present invention resides in the discovery of<br>
a unique lubrication system for a horizontal-type scroll compressor that delivers lubrication<br>
fluid from the discharge pressure zone to the lubricant passage in the crankshaft in the<br>
suction pressure zone of the compressor system. The lubrication system may also<br>
accommodate movement of the horizontal-type scroll compressor, such as when employed<br>
on a mobile platform, while still providing a sufficient flow of lubricant.<br>
Further areas of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the<br>
detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be understood however that the detailed<br>
description and specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the<br>
invention, are intended for purposes of illustration only, since various changes and<br>
modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
The following description of the preferred embodiment is merely exemplary in nature and<br>
is in no way intended to limit the invention, its application, or uses.<br>
While the present invention is suitable for incorporation with many different types of scroll<br>
machines, for exemplary purposes, it will be described herein incorporated in a scroll<br>
compressor of the general structure illustrated in FIG. 1. Referring now to the drawings,<br>
and in particular to FIG. 1, a compressor 10 is shown which comprises a generally<br>
cylindrical hermetic shell 12 having welded at opposing ends thereof caps 14, 16 Cap 14 is<br>
provided with a discharge fitting 18 which may have the usual discharge valve therein.<br>
Other major elements affixed to shell 12 include an inlet fitting 20, a transversely extending<br>
partition 22 which is welded about its periphery at the same point that cap 14 is welded to<br>
cylindrical shell 12. A discharge chamber 23 is defined by cap 14 and partition 22.<br><br>
A main bearing housing 24 having a plurality of radially outwardly extending legs is<br>
secured to the cylindrical shell 12. A second bearing housing 26 is secured to a mounting<br>
plate 27 which extends outwardly and is secured to cylindrical shell 12. A motor 28 which<br>
includes a stator 30 is supported within cylindrical shell 12 between main bearing housing<br>
24 and second bearing housing 26. A crankshaft 32 has an eccentric crankpin 33 at one end<br>
34 thereof. Crankpin 33 is rotatably journaled in an orbiting scroll bearing 36, as described<br>
in more detail below. Orbiting scroll bearing 36 has a circular outer diameter. End 34 of<br>
crankshaft 32 is also rotatably journaled in a main bearing 37 in main bearing housing 24<br>
while the opposite end 39 of crankshaft 32 is rotatably journaled in a second main bearing<br>
38 in second bearing housing 26.<br>
Crankshaft 32 has, at a second end 39, a relatively large diameter concentric bore 40 which<br>
communicates with a radially outwardly smaller diameter bore 42 extending therefrom to<br>
first end 34 of crankshaft 32. Bores 40, 42 form an internal lubricant passage 44 in<br>
crankshaft 32. A sealing member or plate 46 is disposed within the inner bore of second<br>
bearing housing 26 and is secured therein with a snap ring 47. Second end 39 of crankshaft<br>
32 pushes against sealing plate 46 during operation to encourage the flow of lubricant<br>
within lubricant passage 44 and inhibit the lubricant from exiting crankshaft 32 through<br>
second end 39. A small gap exists between end 39 of crankshaft 32 and sealing plate 46<br>
when motor 28 is not energized.<br>
Crankshaft 32 is rotatably driven by electric motor 28 including rotor 48 and stator<br>
windings 50 passing therethrough. Rotor 48 is press fitted on crankshaft 32 and includes<br>
first and second counterweights 52 and 54, respectively.<br>
A first surface of the main bearing housing 24 is provided with a flat thrust bearing surface<br>
56 against which is disposed an orbiting scroll 58 having the usual spiral vane or wrap 60<br>
on a first surface thereof. Projecting from the second surface of orbiting scroll 58 is a<br>
cylindrical hub 61 having a journal bearing 62 therein. Rotatably disposed within bearing<br>
62 is orbiting scroll bearing 36 which has a D-shaped inner bore 66 in which crankpin 33 is<br><br>
drivingly disposed. The crankpin has a flat on one surface which drivingly engages the flat<br>
surface of bore 66 to provide a radially compliant driving arrangement, such as shown in<br>
assignee's U.S. Pat. No. 4,877,382, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
An Oldham coupling 68 is disposed between orbiting scroll 58 and bearing housing 24.<br>
Oldham coupling 68 is keyed to orbiting scroll 58 and a non-orbiting scroll 70 to prevent<br>
rotational movement of orbiting scroll member 58. Oldham coupling 68 is preferably of the .<br>
type disclosed in assignee's U.S. Pat. No. 5,320,506, the disclosure of which is hereby<br>
incorporated herein by reference. A floating seal 71 is supported by the non-orbiting scroll<br>
70 and engages a seat portion 72 mounted to the partition 22 for sealingly dividing an<br>
intake chamber 73 from discharge chamber 23.<br>
Non-orbiting scroll 70 is provided having a wrap 74 positioned in meshing engagement<br>
with wrap 60 of orbiting scroll 58. Non-orbiting scroll 70 has a centrally disposed<br>
discharge passage or port 75 defined by a base plate portion 76. Non-orbiting scroll 70 also<br>
includes an annular hub portion 78 which surrounds the discharge passage 75. A unitary<br>
shut down device or discharge valve 79 can be provided in discharge passage 75. Discharge<br>
valve 79 is preferably always open during operation of compressor 10 such that it is not<br>
dynamically opening and closing during operation. When operation of compressor 10<br>
ceases, discharge valve 79 closes. During operation of compressor 10, working fluid and<br>
lubricant flow from intake chamber 73 through lower scroll intake 84 and into the<br>
chambers formed between wraps 60, 74 and are subsequently discharged through discharge<br>
passage 75, discharge valve 79 and through an opening 82 in partition 22 and on into a<br>
lubricant separator 90.<br>
Referring now to FIGS. 1-4, details of lubricant separator 90 utilized in compressor 10 are<br>
shown. Separator 90 is generally a walled cylinder with an outer surface 92, opposite ends<br>
94, 96 and an uncompressed length L.sub.l therebetween, as shown in FIG. 3. An opening<br>
98 in end 96 communicates with an interior 100 of separator 90. End 96 abuts partition 22<br>
with openings 82, 98 generally aligned. Opening 98 thereby communicates with discharge<br><br><br>
passage 75 of non-orbiting scroll 70 via discharge valve 79. Separator 90 is formed from a<br>
metal wire mesh having a desired mesh density and/or open area. For example, for a steel<br>
separator a mesh density of 10% by weight may be utilized. The wire diameter may be of<br>
various values. For example, a wire diameter of 0.006 inches may be utilized. It should be<br>
appreciated, however, that other types of material, densities and diameters can be used to<br>
form the mesh.<br>
Compressed working fluid and lubricant exit discharge valve 79 and flow into interior 100<br>
of separator 90. Within separator 90, a substantial amount of the lubricant is separated from<br>
the working fluid with the lubricant collecting within lower portion of discharge chamber<br>
23 and the working fluid flowing out through discharge fitting 18. For example, separator<br>
90 may be configured to remove 99% or more of the lubricant from the working fluid.<br>
A metal holder 106 is configured to hold separator 90 within discharge chamber 23 of<br>
compressor 10. Holder 106 includes a trough portion 108 which supports a majority of<br>
separator 90. Holder 106 also includes an annular portion 110 that encircles a portion of<br>
outer surface 92 and end 94 of separator 90. A slit or slot 112 in trough 108 allows<br>
lubricant to drain from separator 90 and holder 106 to accumulate in the lower portion of<br>
discharge chamber 23. It should be appreciated that other types of openings can be<br>
employed in trough portion 108 and/or annular portion 110 to allow lubricant to drain from<br>
holder 106. For example, a plurality of apertures can be disposed along trough 108 and/or<br>
annular portion 110 to allow lubricant within separator 90 to flow via gravity to the lower<br>
portion of discharge chamber 23.<br>
Holder 106 is secured to end cap 114 and compresses separator 90 to a compressed length<br>
of L.sub.2 (L.sub.2 being less than L.sub.l), as shown in FIG. 1, when installed in<br>
compressor 10. That is, when end cap 14 is attached to shell 12, the dimensions of<br>
discharge chamber 23 cause separator 90 to be compressed between partition 22 and end<br>
cap 14. Compression, of separator 90 helps to retain separator 90 in a desired position<br>
within discharge chamber 23.<br><br><br>
Referring now to FIGS. 1, 2 and 6, a lubricant feed line/passageway 120 extends from the<br>
lower portion of discharge chamber 23 to bearing housing 26. Lubricant feed passageway<br>
120 communicates with discharge chamber 23 and lubricant passage 44 of crankshaft 32<br>
and supplies lubricant from discharge chamber 23 to lubricant passage 44. The lubricant is<br>
forced through lubricant feed passageway 120 due to the pressure differential between<br>
discharge chamber 23 (at discharge pressure) and intake chamber 73 (at suction pressure).<br>
Lubricant feed passageway 120 is formed by tubing members 122, 124, such as copper<br>
tubing, interconnected by a fitting 126. Fitting 126 extends through partition 22. A screen<br>
or filtering element 128 is attached to the open end of tubing member 122 and inhibits<br>
debris or other foreign matter from entering lubricant feed passageway 120. Another fitting<br>
130 interconnects tubing member 124 with a bore 132 in bearing housing 26. Suitable<br>
fittings are available from Swagelok Company of Solon, Ohio. Crankshaft.32 has multiple<br>
openings or bores 136 adjacent end 39 extending from large bore 40 to an exterior of<br>
crankshaft 32.<br>
A majority of the lubricant flowing through bore 132 in bearing housing 26 flows into<br>
lubricant passage 44 in crankshaft 32 via openings 136 while the remaining lubricant flows<br>
around the exterior of crankshaft 32 and lubricates bearing 38. The quantity of lubricant<br>
delivered to lubricant passage 44 affects the efficiency and performance of compressor 10.<br>
Thus, controlling the quantity of lubricant flowing through crankshaft 32 is important. The<br>
size and/or diameter of screen 128, tubing 122, 124, fittings 126, 130, bore 132 and<br>
openings 136 affect the quantity of lubricant flowing into lubricant passage 44 in<br>
crankshaft 32. Thus, these dimensions are chosen to provide a desired lubricant flow rate<br>
for the nominal pressure differential expected to occur between discharge chamber 23 and<br>
intake chamber 73 during operation of compressor 10.<br>
Of particular note is the function of openings 136 in controlling the quantity of lubricant<br>
delivered to lubricant passageway 44. Openings 136 are sized to meter the flow of lubricant<br>
based upon the pressure differential and to provide a desired percentage of open area in the<br>
region of bore 132. The percentage of open area is a function of the number of openings<br>
136 in crankshaft 32 and the size of the openings 136. As a result of the size and number of<br><br><br>
openings 136, lubricant flowing through bore 132 will sometimes see openings 136 and<br>
other times will see the solid exterior surface of crankshaft 32. The percentage of open area<br>
is chosen based upon the nominal pressure differential expected to occur between discharge<br>
chamber 23 and intake chamber 73 during operation of the compressor. Thus, the number<br>
of openings 136 and/or the size of the openings 136 can be adjusted to provide a desired<br>
flow rate of lubricant into lubricant passageway 44. Additionally, the use of multiple<br>
openings 136 to provide the desired percentage of open area enables larger openings to be .<br>
utilized, as opposed to systems wherein lubricant flows through a passageway in crankshaft<br>
32 that is exposed to a lubricant passageway 100% of the time. As a result, more accurate<br>
metering of lubricant flowing into lubricant passageway 44 may be achieved. Moreover,<br>
openings 136 are preferably located on crankshaft 32 in a non-load bearing region. That is,<br>
a portion of crankshaft 32 within bearing 38 will be load bearing and ride upon a lubricant<br>
film disposed between the exterior of crankshaft 32 and bearing 38. The pressure<br>
developed in this load-bearing region is relatively high. By locating openings 136 in a non-<br>
load bearing portion of crankshaft 32, these high pressures can be avoided and, as a result,<br>
proper metering of lubricant into lubricant passageway 44 via openings 136 can be<br>
achieved. The use of two openings 136 spaced 180.degree. apart facilitates the<br>
manufacturing of crankshaft 32. That is, by having two openings 180 degree, apart, a<br>
simple drilling or boring operation can be performed on crankshaft 32 to form both of the<br>
openings. Thus, the use of opposing openings facilitates the manufacture of crankshaft 32.<br>
A space filling component 140, shown in FIGS. 1, 5 and 6, is disposed within intake<br>
chamber 73 adjacent end cap 16. Space filling component 140 is generally cylindrical and<br>
is configured to occupy a majority of the space between motor 28 and end cap 16 that<br>
would otherwise be empty or void. The use of space filling component 140 reduces the<br>
empty space (voids) within intake chamber 73 and, thus, limits the location and/or quantity<br>
of lubricant within intake chamber 73. This is especially important when compressor 10 is<br>
utilized in a mobile application or platform, such as a vehicle, tractor, aircraft and the like.<br>
In such applications, compressor 10 may be subjected to tilting of up to 30 degrees or more<br>
along all three-dimensional axes. By eliminating some of the voids within intake chamber<br>
73, adequate positioning and supplying of lubricant to the components of compressor 10<br><br><br>
can be realized, regardless of the tilting of compressor 10. Additionally, limiting the<br>
location of the lubricant may facilitate atomizing the lubricant within the working fluid by<br>
the rotating rotor and counterweight 48, 54.<br>
Space filling component 140 includes a central opening 142 within which a hub portion of<br>
bearing housing 26 is disposed. Space filling component 140 also includes a channel 144<br>
on one end thereof within which mounting plate 27 and a part of bearing housing 26 are<br>
disposed. Space filling component 140 is secured to mounting plate 27. Space filling<br>
component 140 also includes a cutout 146 to accommodate tubing member 124 and fitting<br>
130. Space filling component 140 is preferably solid and can be made from a variety of<br>
materials. Preferably, space filling component 140 is made from aluminum due to the<br>
proximity to the location where end cap 16 will be welded to shell 12 and to be lightweight.<br>
It should be appreciated, however, that other materials can be employed and that space<br>
filling component 140 may be hollow.<br>
Referring now to FIGS., 1, 2 and 7, brackets 150 for mounting compressor 10 to another<br>
component are shown. Brackets 150 include two legs 152, 154 that are secured to shell 12.<br>
A weld nut 156 is disposed in a central portion of each bracket 150. Weld nut 156<br>
facilitates the attachment of compressor 10 to another component. For example, a mounting<br>
bracket having one or more grommets can be attached to each bracket 150 via weld nut<br>
156. The grommets would help dampen vibration of compressor 10 when mounted in<br>
place. In the present invention, two brackets 150 spaced 90 degrees apart are utilized to<br>
secure compressor 10 to a desired component. It should be appreciated, however, that<br>
brackets 150 can take other forms and can be more or less than two without departing from<br>
the spirit and scope of the present invention.<br>
In operation, motor 28 is energized and causes rotor 48 to take a particular orientation<br>
within the field generated by stator windings 50. The movement of rotor 48 causes<br>
crankshaft 32 to move to the right with the movement of rotor 48. The movement of<br>
crankshaft 32 to the right causes end 39 to seal against sealing plate 46. Energizing motor<br>
28 also causes crankshaft 32 to begin rotating about its axis, thereby causing orbiting scroll<br><br><br>
58 to move relative to non-orbiting scroll 70. This rotation pulls working fluid into intake<br>
chamber 73. Within intake chamber 73, working fluid and lubricant mix together and are<br>
pulled into lower scroll intake 84 and between the wraps 60, 74 of orbiting and non-<br>
orbiting scrolls 58, 70. The working fluid and lubricant are compressed therein and<br>
discharged through discharge passage 75 and discharge valve 79 at the discharge pressure.<br>
The discharged working fluid and lubricant flow- into lubricant separator 90 wherein the<br>
working fluid passes through the mesh of separator 90 and the lubricant therein is<br>
entrapped by the mesh. The entrapped lubricant, via gravity, flows into trough 108 and<br>
through slot 112 to bottom portion of discharge chamber 23. The working fluid flows out<br>
of discharge chamber 23 through discharge fitting 18 and into the system within which<br>
compressor 10 is utilized. If the system is a closed system, the working fluid, after passing<br>
through the system, flows back into intake chamber 73 of compressor 10 via inlet fitting<br>
20.<br>
The pressure differential between discharge chamber 23 and intake chamber 73 forces<br>
lubricant within discharge chamber 23 to flow into and through lubricant feed passageway<br>
120 and into bore 132 of bearing housing 26. A portion of the lubricant flowing into bore<br>
132 flows into lubricant passage 44 in crankshaft 32 via openings 136. The remaining<br>
portion of lubricant flowing into bore 132 flows around the exterior of crankshaft 32 and<br>
lubricates bearing 38. The lubricant within lubricant passage 44 flows, via rotation of<br>
crankshafts, to the left and toward bearing housing 24. Openings (not shown) along the<br>
end of crankshaft 32 adjacent bearing housing 24 allow the lubricant therein to exit<br>
lubricant passage 44 and lubricate the exterior of crankshaft 32, bearing 36, journal bearing<br>
62 and Oldham coupling 68. The lubricant then drops into lower portion of intake chamber<br>
73. The lubricant within intake chamber 73 may form into a mist that is mixed with the<br>
working fluid flowing through intake chamber 73.<br>
Thus, the lubrication system utilized with the horizontal-type compressor is self contained.<br>
The lubrication system is contained entirely within the hermetic shell 12 and does not<br>
receive lubrication from an external lubricant source. That is, compressor 10 does not<br>
require the use of a dedicated external lubricant supply to supply lubrication to the<br><br><br>
components of compressor 10 Rather, the only external lubrication flowing into<br>
compressor 10 is that contained within the working fluid that is not removed by separator<br>
90 and flows through the system through which the working fluid passes prior to re-<br>
entering compressor 10 via inlet fitting 20. Thus, compressor 10 according to the principles<br>
of the present invention, via the use of an internal lubricant separator, avoids the necessity<br>
of using an external lubricant source to separate lubricant from the working fluid and<br>
subsequently provide the lubricant to the appropriate components of compressor 10. This<br>
configuration advantageously allows for the entire lubrication system to be contained<br>
within shell 12 and reduces the overall size and space required for compressor 10.<br>
According to the present invention, a horizontal-type compressor can utilize the pressure<br>
differential between the discharge pressure and the suction pressure to route lubricant<br>
throughout the compressor. In addition, the lubricant system can supply the required<br>
lubrication while the horizontal-type compressor is pivoted up to 30 degrees or more about<br>
its three axes. Furthermore, it should be understood that while the lubrication system of the<br>
present invention is shown as being employed within a horizontal scroll-type compressor,<br>
the lubrication system may be employed in other types of compressors. Moreover, the<br>
lubrication system may also be able to be employed within a vertical compressor, although<br>
all of the benefits of the present invention may not be realized. Additionally, while the<br>
present invention is shown on a horizontal compressor with the motor within the shell, the<br>
invention can also be utilized in an open-drive compressor wherein the motor is external to<br>
the shell and drives a shaft that extends through the shell.<br>
As used herein, the term "hermetic" means being completely sealed regardless of the<br>
method of sealing. By way of non-limiting example, the sealing may be achieved by<br>
welding, brazing, gaskets, O-rings, sealants and the like.<br>
The invention being thus described, it will be obvious that the same may be varied in many<br>
ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the<br>
invention, and all such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are<br>
intended to be included within the scope of the following claims.<br><br><br>

ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE<br>
A horizontal scroll-type compressor utilizes the pressure differential<br>
between the discharge pressure and the suction pressure to route lubricant from<br>
the discharge chamber to the components within the intake chamber. The<br>
compressor may utilize a lubricant separator within the discharge chamber to<br>
separate the working fluid from the lubricant prior to the working fluid exiting the<br>
compressor. The compressor may use an internal passageway that extends<br>
from the discharge chamber to a position adjacent the crankshaft to provide<br>
lubricant to the internal lubricant passage within the crankshaft.<br></td>
