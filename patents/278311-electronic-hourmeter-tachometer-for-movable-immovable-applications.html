				<td>The invention relates to a method and system of generating warranty claims and/or billing using electronic hourmeter for movable and immovable applications.<br>
Electronic hourmeter serves as a means for justifying warranty claims for commercial vehicles and generator sets (movable and immovable respectively) where the engine running hours is of critical importance. It also serves as a means for billing of engine utilization hours in engine test beds or generator sets.<br>
BACKGROUND:<br>
Presently, electromechanical hourmeters are widely used. These devices have high failure rates and high maintenance expenses. Electronic hourmeter overcomes the drawbacks of the electromechanical hourmeters. For commercial vehicles and generator sets, engine running time is the main data on which the warranty claims are based and therefore, the customer may want to know running hours of an engine. The start and stop time of an engine is useful in determining the utilization of an engine. The same data can be used for billing purpose. Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and research institutions wish to determine the utilization hours of engine in their test beds based on which their customers can be billed. Presently, there is no method for achieving the above requirements of generating warranty claims or billing using electronic hourmeters.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention therefore discloses a method and system of generating warranty claims or billing using electronic hourmeters. For such applications an electronic hourmeter proves to be extremely useful to keep track of engine running time in terms of hours, start and stop time of engine, date, with data logging capability. For immovable applications, in the case of generator sets, engine test beds, etc., the electronic hourmeter can be interfaced to back-end billing system for automatic retrieval of data and post-processing.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention discloses a method and system of generating warranty claims or billing using electronic hourmeters. In this application, the accumulated time period when an internal combustion engine or the like is in operation is measured and displayed along with date, time and other tachograph functionalities. The engine operating history is also stored in memory for later downloading. The method also includes the interfacing of electronic hourmeter with other electronic control units. Apart from being used to generate warranty claims the hourmeter can also be interfaced with telematics unit for wireless transmission of the available data to the OEMs or dealer locations who can further alert their customers for timely maintenance. Electronic hourmeter can be a billing tool for engine test beds and generator sets especially in a rental environment.<br>
The proposed system is equipped with interface units to process engine speed and vehicle speed data to display the required hourmeter and tachograph parameters. The system also has a real time clock (RTC) to keep track of time and date. The electronic unit processes raw engine speed and vehicle speed data and converts them to required engineering values. The unit has provision to log the data for future download. The unit can be interfaced with application software for retrieval of logged data or for display purpose.<br>
The unit is also equipped with proper communication related components for real time transfer of data. In the case of movable application, the unit with suitable automotive grade communication layer, controller area network (CAN), for interfacing with other electronic control units can be used. In the case of immovable applications, the unit with suitable communication layer, Ethernet with TCPIP or RS232, etc., for interface with existing back-end.<br>
The system can be interfaced with the other electronic control units for wireless transmission of data to the required location. For commercial vehicle which fall under the category of movable applications, OEMs or dealers may want to know the engine running hours, who can in turn remotely alert their customers for timely maintenance. For immovable applications like generator sets and engine test beds, which are given on rental basis, engine running hours, engine start time, and stop time data can be transmitted via Ethernet with TCPIP or RS232 or by wireless transmission to the billing station. The system can also be used for all vehicles, including commercial vehicles.<br>
The invention therefore relates to a method of generating warranty claims and/or billing based on the engine utilization hours for movable or immovable applications using electronic hourmeter comprising the steps of: acquiring engine speed input signal from engine speed sensor; conditioning the said signal with a signal conditioning means; feeding said conditioned engine speed input signal into a micro processor; computing the running hours of the engine based on the engine speed input signal; store the engine running hours in the memory; transmitting the obtained engine utilization hours for further warranty claims processing and/or bill generation through suitable interfacing means.<br>
The invention also relates to a system for generating warranty claims and/or billing based on the engine utilization hours using electronic hourmeter for movable or immovable applications comprising: sensor means for inputting the engine speed; a real time clock for calculating and updating the date and time of engine operation; signal conditioning means for conditioning the engine speed input signal; a micro controller for computing the engine utilization hours; RAM, EEPROM or other memory devices for storage of the engine running hours; interface means for communicating the computed engine utilization hours to warranty claim processing station and/or billing station.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 shows the hardware features of the hourmeter Figure 2 shows the timing diagram of the hourmeter operation Figure 3 shows the system operation for immovable applications Figure 4 shows the system operation for movable applications DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention enables the measurement of engine operating parameters in movable and/or immovable applications for analyzing the resultant information to generate warranty claims or for billing customers based on usage of the application.<br>
Electronic hourmeter utilizes the engine speed obtained from the engine speed sensor and the RTC to track the engine running hours. With the different communication interfaces available, the information received can cater to attain the object of the invention in both movable and immovable applications. With the addition of vehicle speed, other tachograph functionalities could be obtained.<br>
SYSTEM PHYSICAL PRESENTATION:<br>
The hardware architecture of this system for processing the input parameters and carrying out the required computations is schematically shown in figure 1. The architecture has been designed to fully meet the requirements and the specifications of the system. The engine speed input signal captured from engine speed sensor (1) and vehicle speed input signal is captured from the vehicle speed sensor (2) which may be mounted on the gearbox or other optical sensors. The engine and/or vehicle speed input signals is suitably conditioned by a signal conditioning unit (3) and then fed to a micro controller (10) for carrying out the required computations. Based on the engine speed availability, the running hours of the engine are calculated. The vehicle battery voltage (B) is scaled down and fed to one of the Analog Digital Converters (ADC) inputs for monitoring battery voltage (B). A Real time clock (RTC) with battery backup is also included to keep track of time and date. Facilities are provided for setting and changing the required date and time. A serial EEPROM (4) is provided to store the hourmeter value. The hardware has provisions for displaying the various parameters through display means (5). Based on the vehicle speed signal received, tacograph parameters are calculated and displayed if required.<br>
When the engine hourmeter unit is powered on, the micro controller (10) reads back the hourmeter data from EEPROM (4) and sends to the display.<br>
When the vehicle is moving, display shall be continuous. The micro controller (10) checks the content of the RAM (6) when engine starts. If RAM (6) data is lost due to switching off of the power, the hourmeter shall read back from the EEPROM (4) content and the same is shown on the display. The resolution of the hourmeter can be configured.<br>
The hourmeter shows the total hours of engine run. The display type can be selected to choose the display range required. If hourmeter reaches maximum value it rolls over to 0. To prevent loss of hourmeter value, if the battery is disconnected, EEPROM (4) can be updated periodically and the time for update can also be configured.<br>
The hourmeter operation is also well explained by the timing diagram as shown in figure 2. A millisecond counter or seconds counter (7) runs continuously and updates the minute counter after every minute. Minute counter in turn increments the hour after reaching the corresponding minute counts.<br>
COMMUNICATION INTERFACE: Immovable applications:<br>
Figure 3 illustrates the operation of the system in the case of immovable applications like generator sets and engine test beds. Immovable applications as mentioned above are often rented and hence the billing is based on the hours of engine run. The billing stations are either in the next adjacent room, in the case of engine test beds (or) at a distance location in the case of generator sets.<br>
As shown in the figure 1 and 3, for the next door billing applications, simple interfacing (20) such as RS232 communication is sufficient for the transmission of engine running hours data determined by the electronic hourmeter as explained in the preceding paragraphs. Ethernet with TCPIP can also be used for the purpose. For billing of generator sets in distant location, data can be wirelessly transmitted through GSM or any other wireless technology to the respective billing stations (11).<br>
Movable applications:<br>
Figure 4 illustrates the operation of the system in the case of movable applications. For commercial vehicles and also other vehicles, the engine running hours is the basis for claiming warranty. Odometer value may not be the right parameter for claiming warranty. Therefore, engine running hours needs to be monitored. The engine running hours as determined by the electronic hourmeter can be linked to a GSM modem for remote transmission of data. The serial interface (20) can either be RS232/Ethernet/CAN. Warranty claims can then be generated by OEMs (12) based on the resulting engine operating hours. The invention as described hitherto should not be limited to the application as detailed above.<br>
The foregoing description provides the detailed working of the invention by way of explanation and illustrations. It is to be understood that modification may now suggest itself to those skilled in the art and that this invention is not limited to the specific embodiment disclosed, except as set forth in the appended claims.<br>
