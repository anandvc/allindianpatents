MULTI-MODE   MULTI-BAND   MOBILE   COMMUNICATION  TERMINAL , SWITCHING METHOD THEREOF<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
The present invention relates to a multi-mode multi-band mobile communication terminal for supporting both an asynchronous communication network and a synchronous communication network, and more particularly to a multi-mode multi-band mobile 10 communication terminal and a mode switching method thereof, which can perform a mode switching between an asynchronous mobile communication network and a synchronous mobile communication network while minimizing interruption in the communication.<br>
[Background Art]<br>
15	The mobile communication service has continuously developed from the first<br>
generation (1G) mobile communication service mainly for voice communication of a low quality as was provided by an analogue cellular type Advanced Mobile Phone System (hereinafter, referred to as "AMPS") which started its service late in the 1980's. The second generation (2G) mobile communication service enabled an improved voice communication<br>
20 and a data service at a low speed (14.4 Kbps) by employing a digital cellular type Global System for Mobile (GSM) scheme, a Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) scheme, a Time Division Multiple Access (CDMA) scheme, etc. In the 2.5th generation (2.5G) mobile communication service, the frequency of GHz band was secured and the Personal Communication Service (PCS) available worldwide was developed, so that the 2.5G<br>
25 mobile communication service achieved an improved voice communication service together with a data communication service at an improved speed (144 Kbps) still low as it is.<br>
Each of the mobile communication networks for the mobile communication services up to the 2.5th generation includes various communication apparatuses such as a<br>
30 user terminal, a base station transmitter, a base station controller, a mobile switching center, a Home Location Register (HLR) and a Visitor Location Register (VLR).<br><br>

The third generation (3G) mobile communication service is provided by two different kinds of systems including a Wideband CDMA (WCDMA) system and a CDMA-2000 system. The WCDMA system is an asynchronous mobile communication system proposed mainly by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and the 5 CDMA-2000 system is a synchronous mobile communication system proposed mainly by the 3GPP2. Especially for the WCDMA system, many communication service providers all over the world are providing or preparing to provide services by employing wireless protocols recommended by the International Mobile Telecommunications-2000 (IMT-2000).<br>
10	The WCDMA system achieves a high communication quality and employs the<br>
spread spectrum scheme, so it is proper for transmission of even a large quantity of data. The WCDMA communication system uses an Adaptive Multi-Rate (AMR) codec having a transmit rate of 12.2 Kbps ~ 4.75 Kbps for voice coding and supports a high mobility enough to allow even a user moving at a speed of 100 Km per hour to perform<br>
15  communication. Many nations are now adopting the WCDMA communication scheme, and the 3GPP constructed by organs of. many countries including the United States, Europe, Republic of Korea, Japan, the People's Republic of China, etc. is now continuously developing technology specifications for the WCDMA communication.<br>
Recently, due to the advantages of the asynchronous WCDMA system as described<br>
20 above, countries basically employing the synchronous CDMA-2000 network, such as the United States, Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China, have started to construct a WCDMA network in order to provide a WCDMA service.<br>
As a result, a mobile communication terminal capable of supporting both the synchronous communication network and the asynchronous communication network has<br>
25 become necessary and a Multi-Mode Multi-Band (MMMB) mobile communication terminal has appeared to meet such a necessity.<br>
The Multi-Mode includes both a synchronous mode and an asynchronous mode, and the Multi-Band includes the frequency band of 800 MHz of the 2G mobile communication service, the frequency band of 800 MHz or 1.8 GHz of the 2.5G mobile<br>
30 communication service, the frequency band of about 2 GHz of the 3G mobile communication service, and a frequency band of the 4G mobile communication service to be provided in the future.<br><br>

K<br>
A mode switching between the asynchronous mode and the synchronous mode is necessary when the MMMB mobile communication terminal moves into an area of a synchronous communication network from an overlap area between areas of synchronous and asynchronous communication networks. According to the conventional method for 5 mode switching, a modem for call connection with the synchronous communication network is operated after the mobile communication terminal completely escapes from the overlap area and the call connection with the asynchronous communication network is interrupted. Therefore, the mode switching according to the conventional method requires an interruption interval of at least approximately 20 seconds during which the<br>
10      communication is interrupted.<br>

Therefore, the present invention has been made in view of the above-mentioned<br>
15 problems, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a multi-mode multi-band<br>
mobile communication terminal and a mode switching method thereof, which can perform<br>
a mode switching between an asynchronous mobile communication network and a<br>
synchronous mobile communication network while minimizing interruption in the<br>
communication.<br>
20	It is another object of the present invention to provide a multi-mode multi-band<br>
mobile communication terminal and a mode switching method thereof, which can minimize a ping-pong phenomenon when the mobile communication terminal performs mode switching between a WCDMA mode and a CDMA mode.<br>

FIG 4 is a view for illustrating the concept of mode switching of a MMMB mobile 5      communication terminal according to the present invention.<br>
As the mobile communication terminal 400 moves from an area A of the asynchronous communication network to a boundary area B between the asynchronous communication network and the synchronous communication network, the mobile communication terminal 400 receives a signal from the asynchronous network radio station 10 10.1 with a reduced intensity. Here, the mobile communication terminal 400 determines based on the measured intensity of the signal from the asynchronous network whether to perform mode switching between the asynchronous mode and the synchronous mode.<br>
The intensity of the signal from the asynchronous network can be obtained based<br>
on a ratio (expressed as Ec/Io; Energy of Carrier/Interference of Others) of the signal<br>
15      intensity of the pilot channel to the magnitude of all received noise, a receive (Rx) power<br>
expressed as RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator), a Received Signal Code Power<br>
(RSCP), etc.<br>
From among those parameters, Ec/Io excessively changes  according to the<br>
surrounding radio environments. In contrast, RSSI and RSCP have a nearly constant<br>
20     threshold value because RSSI is a receive power of the mobile communication terminal<br>
and RSCP is a value obtained through the decoding of the signal received by the mobile<br>
communication terminal.<br>
Therefore, the present invention employs RSSI or RSCP instead of Ec/Io in measuring the signal intensity. Hereinafter, a method using RSCP will be described, 25      although the same method can be applied to RSSI also.<br>
FIG 5 is a graph for illustrating a mode switching based on a signal intensity in a method for mode switching according to the first embodiment of the present invention. Here, the signal intensity will be described based on RSCP.<br>
As noted from FIG 5, when the signal intensity lowers below a preset threshold<br>
30     value TH, the mobile communication terminal 400 recognizes that it is currently escaping<br>
from the area of the asynchronous communication network and determines if such a state<br>
continues during a predetermined time interval T. When such a state continues during a<br><br>
WO 2005/086378<br>
predetermined time interval T, the mobile communication terminal 400 prepares mode switching from the asynchronous mode to the synchronous mode by operating the synchronous modem. In the state where the synchronous modem is operated, when the signal from the radio station of the asynchronous communication network is released, the 5 mobile communication terminal 400 determines that it has escaped from the area A of the asynchronous communication network and entered the area C of the asynchronous communication network. Then, the mobile communication terminal 400 instantly connects with the synchronous communication network through the synchronous modem, thereby completing the mode switching.<br>
10	FIG 6 is a flowchart of the method for mode switching according to the first<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The method for mode switching according to the first embodiment of the present invention is a method performed when the MMMB mobile communication terminal is in an idle state.<br>
Referring to FIG 6, when the mobile communication terminal 400 is in an idle<br>
15 state in the area of the asynchronous communication network 100 (step S10), the main processor 443 determines if RSCP has a value lower than the preset threshold value TH (step S20).<br>
When it is determined in step S20 that RSCP has a value lower than the preset threshold value TH, the main processor 443 determines if the state in which RSCP has a<br>
20 value lower than the preset threshold value TH is maintained during a predetermined time interval T(step S30).<br>
When it is determined in step S30 that the state in which RSCP has a value lower than the preset threshold value TH is maintained during a predetermined time interval T, the main processor 443 operates the synchronous modem 434 for communication with the<br>
25 synchronous communication network 200 (step S40). Then, the main processor 443 converts the current communication mode into the synchronous mode (step S50) and then goes into a synchronous mode idle state (step S60).<br>
Next, a method for mode switching of an MMMB mobile communication terminal according to the second embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail<br>
30 with reference to FIG 7. The second embodiment of the present invention is different from the first embodiment in that the method for mode switching according to the second embodiment   of the   present   invention   is   performed   when   the   MMMB   mobile<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/000600<br>
y\5<br>
communication terminal is in a traffic state.<br>
FIG 7 is a flowchart of a method for mode switching according to the second embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 7, when the mobile communication terminal 400 is in a traffic 5     state in the area of the asynchronous communication network 100 (step SI 10), the main processor 443 determines if RSCP has a value lower than the preset threshold value TH (step S120).<br>
When it is determined in step SI20 that RSCP has a value lower than the preset threshold value TH, the main processor 443 determines if the state in which RSCP has a 10     value lower than the preset threshold value TH is maintained during a predetermined time interval T(step SI30).<br>
When it is determined in step SI30 that the state in which RSCP has a value lower than the preset threshold value TH is maintained during a predetermined time interval T, the main processor 443 monitors a BLock Error Rate (BLER) which indicates the rate of 15     defective blocks per second received at the radio end (step S140).<br>
Then, when it is determined in step SI50 that the BLER monitored in step SI40<br>
exceeds a preset threshold value (e.g. about 10%), the main processor 443 operates the<br>
synchronous modem 434 in order to prepare communication with the synchronous<br>
communication network 200 (step SI60).<br>
20	Here, steps SI40 and SI50 may be omissible because they are necessary only to<br>
compensate for and are not indispensable in the second embodiment of the present invention. In the case where steps SI40 and SI50 are omitted, when it is determined in step SI30 that the state in which RSCP has a value lower than the preset threshold value TH is maintained during a predetermined time interval T, the main processor 443 operates the 25 synchronous modem 434 in order to prepare communication with the synchronous communication network 200 (step SI60).<br>
In this case, even after operating the synchronous modem 434, the main processor 443 does not attempt registration of the synchronous communication network 200. Further, the main processor 443 determines if the asynchronous mode call currently in a traffic state 30     has ended or not (step S170).<br>
When it is determined in step SI 70 that the traffic state of the asynchronous mode call has been ended, the main processor 443 determines if the mobile communication<br><br>

PCT/KR2005/000600<br><br>
L<br>
terminal 400 is located within the area of the asynchronous communication network 100 in order to go into an idle state (step SI80).<br>
When it is determined in step SI80 that the mobile communication terminal 400 is located within the area of the asynchronous communication network 100, the main 5     processor goes into the asynchronous mode idle state (step SI90) in which the synchronous modem 434 operated in step SI60 is inactivated.<br>
However, when it is determined in step SI80 that the mobile communication terminal 400 is not located within the area of the asynchronous communication network 100, which means that the mobile communication terminal 400 is located within the area<br>
10 of the synchronous communication network, the main processor 443 goes into the synchronous mode idle state (step SI81) in which the asynchronous modem 424 is inactivated.<br>
Meanwhile, when it is determined in step SI70 that the traffic state of the asynchronous mode call has not ended yet, the main processor 443 determines if the radio<br>
15 link with the asynchronous communication network 100 has been released or not (step SI71). Specifically, the main processor 443 determines whether the mobile communication terminal 400 has escaped from the area of the asynchronous communication network 100, and performs mode switching into the synchronous mode through the synchronous modem 434 started its operation in step SI60 when it is determined that the mobile communication<br>
20 terminal 400 has escaped from the area of the asynchronous communication network 100 (step SI72).<br>
Then, the main processor 443 determines if the call has been ended or not (step SI73). When it is determined in step SI73 that the call has been ended, the main processor 443 performs step SI80 and determines if the mobile communication terminal 400 is<br>
25 currently located within the area of the asynchronous communication network 100 in order to go into the idle state. When it is determined in step SI80 that the mobile communication terminal 400 is located within the area of the asynchronous communication network 100, the main processor goes into the asynchronous mode idle state (step SI90) in which the synchronous modem 434 started its operation in step SI60 is inactive.<br>
30	However, when it is determined in step SI80 that the mobile communication<br>
terminal 400 is not located within the area of the asynchronous communication network 100, which means that the mobile communication terminal 400 is located within the area<br><br>
WO 2005/086378<br>
J8l-f<br>
of the synchronous communication network, the main processor 443 goes into the synchronous mode idle state (step SI81) in which the asynchronous modem 424 is inactivated.<br>
Then, when it is determined in step SI71 that the radio link with the asynchronous<br>
5     communication network 100 has not been released, the main processor 443 determines if<br>
the RSCP has a value exceeding a preset threshold value TH or not in order to determine if<br>
the mobile communication terminal 400 is currently located within the area of the<br>
asynchronous communication network 100 or not (step SI74).<br>
When it is determined in step SI74 that the RSCP has a value exceeding the preset<br>
10     threshold value TH, the main processor 443 determines that the mobile communication<br>
terminal 400 is currently located within the area of the asynchronous communication<br>
network 100 and turns off the currently operating synchronous modem 434 (step SI75),<br>
and then proceeds to step S170.<br>
Although the previous embodiment has been described by using the parameter 15      RSCP of the received signal code power as an example, the same can be said in steps S20, SI20 and SI74 by using the power value RSSI of the received signal itself instead of the RSCP.<br>
Further, it is possible to realize the present invention by using both of the parameters RSCP and RSSI, specifically, by measuring the received signal code power and 20     the power value RSSI of the received signal itself and then comparing them with preset reference values in steps S20, SI20 and SI74.<br>
Hereinafter, a method for mode switching of an MMMB mobile communication terminal according to the third embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to FIG. 8. According to the third embodiment of the present invention, 25 the mode switching from the asynchronous mode to the synchronous mode is performed based on the system information block transmitted from the asynchronous communication network.<br>
FIG 8 is a flowchart of a method for mode switching according to the third<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
30	Referring to  FIG   8,  the mobile  communication terminal  monitors  system<br>
information blocks of each cell transmitted from a radio station of the asynchronous<br>
communication network while performing cell selection (step S210). Further, the mobile<br><br>

PCT/KR2005/000600<br><br><br><br>
4-<br><br>
&amp;\V<br><br>
communication terminal determines if a parameter in the monitored system information block has been preset to indicate mode switching into the synchronous communication network (step S220).<br>
When it is determined in step S220 that a parameter in the monitored system 5 information block has been preset to indicate mode switching into the synchronous communication network, the mobile communication terminal determines if the terminal mode is currently set as the preferred asynchronous mode (step S230). In the preferred asynchronous mode, the mobile communication terminal first connects with the asynchronous   communication  network   and   then   connects   with   the   synchronous<br>
10 communication network when it fails to connect with the asynchronous communication network.<br>
When it is determined in step S230 that the terminal mode is currently set as the preferred asynchronous mode, the mobile communication terminal determines if a Mobile Country Code (MCC) contained in the system information block is a preset country code<br>
15 (1st parameter; for example, a parameter having a value of 450 (MCC=450) for Republic of Korea) and if a Mobile Network Code (MNC) is a preset network code (2nd parameter; for example, a parameter having a value of 05 (MNC=05) for SK Telecom Co., Ltd.) in step S240.<br>
When it is determined in step S240 that the MCC is preset as the first parameter<br>
20 and the MNC is preset as the second parameter, the mobile communication terminal determines that it is necessary to shift into the synchronous mode and operates the synchronous modem (step S250). After operating the synchronous modem, the mobile communication terminal switches the current communication mode (asynchronous mode) to the synchronous mode (step S260).<br>
25	When it is determined in step S230 that the current terminal mode is not the<br>
preferred asynchronous mode, for example, when the currently set terminal mode is the dedicated asynchronous mode, the mobile communication terminal does not perform the mode switching and maintains the current asynchronous mode even though the system information block satisfies conditions for the mode switching (step S231).<br>
30	Also, when it is determined in step S240 that the MCC is not preset as the first<br>
parameter or the MNC is not preset as the second parameter, the mobile communication terminal does not perform the mode switching and maintains the current asynchronous<br><br>

X<br>
mode even though the system information block satisfies conditions for mode switching (stepS231).<br>
Next, a method for mode switching of an MMMB mobile communication terminal according to the fourth embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail 5 with reference to FIG 9. According to the fourth embodiment of the present invention, the mobile communication terminal performs the mode switching from the asynchronous mode to the synchronous mode based on overhead message information (e.g. base ID information) transmitted from the synchronous communication network.<br>
FIG. 9 is a flowchart of a method for mode switching according to the fourth 10     embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 9, the mobile communication terminal in communication through the synchronous communication network checks overhead message information of the BSC 202 of the synchronous communication network 200 (step S310). Then, the MCT determines if the base ID information found in step S310 includes a preset mode switch 15 parameter (step S320). Here, the mode switch parameter is set at a bit at a predetermined ordinal position (the second bit in the present embodiment) from the Most Significant Bit (MSB) in the base ID and is a parameter for notifying the overlap area between the asynchronous communication network and the synchronous communication network.<br>
When it is determined in step S320 that the base ID information found in step<br>
20      S310 includes a preset mode switch parameter, the mobile communication terminal<br>
determines if the terminal mode is currently set as one of the preferred asynchronous mode<br>
and the preferred synchronous mode or not (step S330). In the preferred asynchronous<br>
mode,   the   mobile   communication   terminal   first   connects   with   the   asynchronous<br>
communication network and then connects with the synchronous communication network<br>
25     when it fails to connect with the asynchronous communication network. In the preferred<br>
synchronous   mode,   the   mobile   communication   terminal   first   connects   with   the<br>
synchronous   communication   network   and   then   connects   with   the   asynchronous<br>
communication network when it fails to connect with the synchronous communication<br>
network.<br>
30	When it is determined in step S330 that the terminal mode is currently set as one<br>
of the preferred asynchronous mode and the preferred synchronous mode, the mobile<br>
communication terminal determines the mode switching into the asynchronous mode and<br><br>
WO 2005/086378<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/000600<br><br>
&gt;3 W)<br>
operates the asynchronous modem (step S340). Then, the mobile communication terminal switches the current communication mode (synchronous mode) to the asynchronous mode (step S350).<br>
When it is determined in step S330 that the current terminal mode is neither the 5     preferred asynchronous mode nor the preferred synchronous mode but is the dedicated synchronous mode, the mobile communication terminal does not perform the mode switching and maintains the current synchronous mode (step S331).<br>
Next, a method for mode switching of an MMMB mobile communication terminal according to the fifth embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail with<br>
10 reference to FIG 10. The method according to the fifth embodiment of the present invention is a specific method in which the mode switching from the asynchronous mode to the synchronous mode is first determined and the synchronous modem is then inactivated and the asynchronous modem is activated in the mobile communication terminal, so that the mobile communication terminal operates in the asynchronous mode.<br>
15	FIG 10 is a flowchart of a method for mode switching according to the fifth<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG 10, the mobile communication terminal 400 in communication through the synchronous communication network operates in the synchronous mode through the synchronous modem (step S410). Then, when the mode switching from the<br>
20 asynchronous mode to the synchronous mode is determined as described above (step S420), the mode switch controller 447 requests mode switching to the asynchronous modem 434 (step S430). Then, the asynchronous modem 434 operates to detect a signal from the asynchronous communication network (step S440) and determines if there is a normally detected signal (step S450).<br>
25	When it is determined in step S450 that there is no WCDMA signal, the<br>
asynchronous modem 434 transmits a sync acquisition failure message to the mode switch controller 447 (step S451) and goes into an off state or a sleep state (step S452).<br>
Upon receiving the sync acquisition failure message in step S451, the mode switch controller 447  recognizes the  failure  in acquisition of sync  of the asynchronous<br>
30 communication network and transmits an operation maintenance message to the synchronous modem 424 to maintain the current state (step S453). Then, the synchronous modem 424 maintains the current state (step S454) and the mobile communication terminal<br><br>
WO 2005/086378<br>
-4.<br>
400 continues to operate in the synchronous mode.<br>
Meanwhile, when it is determined in step S450 that a WCDMA signal has been detected and the sync has been acquired, the asynchronous modem 434 requests registration of location to the asynchronous communication network (step S461). When the 5 location information of the mobile communication terminal 400 in the asynchronous communication network is registered in the HLR 207 in response to the request (step S462), the HLR 207 transmits a response reporting the location registration (step S463). Further, the asynchronous communication network transmits the response reporting the location registration to the synchronous modem 434 (step S464).<br>
10	After receiving the response in step 464, the synchronous modem 434 transmits to<br>
the mode switch controller 447 a message reporting the current state, that is, a message reporting that the location registration to the asynchronous communication network has been completed (step S470). Then, the asynchronous modem 424 is activated and the mobile communication terminal 400 operates in the asynchronous mode (step S480).<br>
15	Here, upon receiving the location registration completion message from the<br>
asynchronous modem 434, the mode switch controller 447 recognizes a success in mode switching into the asynchronous communication network. Then, the mode switch controller 447 transmits to the synchronous modem 424 a message in order to deactivate the synchronous modem 424 into the off state or sleep state (step S471). Then, the<br>
20      synchronous modem 424 is deactivated (step S472) and the mode switching is completed.<br>
Next, a method for mode switching of an MMMB mobile communication terminal<br>
according to the sixth embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail with<br>
reference to FIG. 11. The method according to the sixth embodiment of the present<br>
invention is a method performed when the synchronous communication network is<br>
25 defective or has such a weak electric field that it is impossible to register the location in the course of the mode switching from the asynchronous mode to the synchronous mode.<br>
Specifically, when the asynchronous communication network is defective or has such a weak electric field that it is impossible to register the location, the mode transition may be repeatedly tried alternately into the synchronous communication network and the<br>
30 asynchronous communication network, thereby causing a ping-pong phenomenon in which the mobile communication terminal continuously stays in a communication disabled state. Therefore, when the mobile communication terminal receives a mode switch command<br><br>
WO 2005/086378<br><br>
PCT/KR2005/000600<br><br>
&amp;7&gt;<br>
i<br>
from the synchronous communication network, the mobile communication terminal tries registration of location by detecting an asynchronous signal in the asynchronous mode. When there is a problem in the switching, the mobile communication terminal returns to the synchronous mode and periodically tries detection of asynchronous signal in order to 5     perform the mode switching into the asynchronous mode.<br>
FIG 11 is a flowchart of a method for mode switching according to the sixth embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG 11, when the mobile communication terminal 400 receives a<br>
switching command  signal  from the  synchronous  communication network 200 and<br>
10     determines to perform the switching from the synchronous communication network 200 to<br>
the asynchronous communication network 100 (step S510), the mobile communication<br>
terminal 400 switches its current communication mode from the synchronous mode to the<br>
asynchronous mode (step S520) and determines if an asynchronous signal is detected (step<br>
S530).<br>
15	When an asynchronous signal is detected, the mobile communication terminal 400<br>
determines if the registration of location to the asynchronous communication network is<br>
completed (step S540). When the registration of location is completed, the mobile<br>
communication   terminal   400   performs   communication   through   the   asynchronous<br>
communication   network.   Here,   the   registration   of  location   to   the   asynchronous<br>
20     communication network refers to registration of location to a Circuit Network (CS) or a<br>
Packet Service (PS) network.<br>
Further, when an asynchronous signal is not detected in step S530 or when it is<br>
impossible to perform communication in the asynchronous mode due to failure in the<br>
registration of location by some problems in the asynchronous communication network,<br>
25     the mobile communication terminal 400 switches back to the synchronous mode (step<br>
S550).<br>
Next, the mobile communication terminal 400 waits a predetermined time interval and counts the number of times of the waiting (step S560) and then switches back to the asynchronous mode (step S520) and determines if an asynchronous signal is detected (step 30      S530). This feedback process is repeated until the location is registered.<br>
Here,   it  is   preferable   to   gradually   increase   the   counting  interval   (which corresponds to a time interval of detecting the asynchronous signal) according to a<br><br>
WO 2005/086378	PCT/KR2005/000600<br>
-i<br>
predetermined basis reflecting the number of times by which the asynchronous signal has<br>
been detected. A counting parameter for determining the counting interval is included in<br>
the   system   parameter   transmitted   from   the   radio   station   of  the   asynchronous<br>
communication network to the mobile communication terminal 400.<br>
5	Therefore, upon receiving a mode switch command, the mobile communication<br>
terminal 400 determines the counting interval for detecting the asynchronous signal based on the counting parameter, waits the counting interval and counts the number of times, and then searches an asynchronous signal.<br>
It is preferred that a basic parameter capable of replacing the counting parameter is<br>
10 preset and stored in the mobile communication terminal, so that the mobile communication terminal 400 can determine the counting interval based oh the stored basic parameter when it fails to receive the counting parameter.<br>
The parameter used for the counting may contain information of, for example, a unit interval T for searching the asynchronous signal, a modulus A for determining the time<br>
15 interval of asynchronous signal searching, and a maximum threshold N max for the number of times for searching the asynchronous signal. When the number of times by which the mobile communication terminal 400 performed searching for the asynchronous signal is put as 'n' the mobile communication terminal 400 determines the counting interval by Equation (1) below.<br>
20<br>
t=An*T	(1)<br>
In Equation (1), 'n' (the number of times of searching for the asynchronous signal) has a value increasing by one each time from 1 to "Nmax' In other words, by Equation (1),<br>
25 the initial counting interval during which the mobile communication terminal 400 waits after failing the registration of location first time is calculated as 'An*T the counting interval during which the mobile communication terminal 400 waits after failing the registration of location first time twice is calculated as 'A2*T' and the counting interval during which the mobile communication terminal 400 waits after failing the registration of<br>
30     location first time twice is calculated as 'A3*TWhen the number of times of searching the asynchronous signal exceeds the threshold value 'Nmax' due to repeated failure in detecting the asynchronous signal, the<br><br>
WO 2005/086378	PCT/KR2005/000600<br>
i<br>
counting interval is fixed to a value ,ANmax*T from then.<br>
Instead of the above parameter and equation (1), various parameters and equations<br>
may be used in order to determine the counting interval, and 'n' may have a value between<br>
1 and 'Nmax'.<br>
5	The present invention is applied to only the cases where the communication mode<br>
of the mobile communication terminal 400 is set as the preferred asynchronous mode or the preferred synchronous mode and is not applied to the cases where the communication mode of the mobile communication terminal 400 is set as the dedicated asynchronous mode or the dedicated synchronous mode. Therefore, upon receiving the mode switch<br>
10 command from the synchronous communication network, the mobile communication terminal 400 checks the current communication mode and preferably searches an asynchronous signal when the current communication mode is one of the preferred asynchronous mode and the preferred synchronous mode.<br>
Next, a method for mode switching of an MMMB mobile communication terminal<br>
15 according to the seventh embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to FIGs. 12 and 13.<br>
FIG 12 is a view for illustrating the concept of mode switching according to the seventh embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG 12, the synchronous communication network area of company A<br>
20 includes a portion, of an asynchronous communication network area of company A and a portion of an asynchronous communication network area of company B. In a case where the mobile communication terminal 400 is a subscriber terminal of company A and its current communication mode is the preferred asynchronous mode, the mobile communication   terminal   400   performs   communication   through   the   asynchronous<br>
25 communication network of company A in an overlap area between the asynchronous communication network area of company A and the synchronous communication network area of company A. In the sole synchronous communication network area of company A, the mobile communication terminal 400 switches into the synchronous mode and performs communication through the synchronous communication network of company A.<br>
30	When the mobile communication terminal 400 in the preferred asynchronous<br>
mode escapes from the asynchronous communication network area of company A and tries registration of location in an overlap area between the asynchronous communication<br><br>
WO 2005/086378<br>
network area of company B and the synchronous communication network area of company A, the mobile communication terminal 400 first searches for an asynchronous signal from the asynchronous communication network of company B instead of the synchronous communication network of company A and requests registration of location to the 5     asynchronous communication network of company B.<br>
Then,. the asynchronous communication network of company B refers to subscriber information of the mobile communication terminal 400 having requested the registration of its location. When the mobile communication terminal 400 having requested the registration of location is not a subscriber of company B, the asynchronous<br>
10 communication network of company B denies the registration of location. Then, the mobile communication terminal 400 having failed in the registration of location switches into an emergency communication state in which the mobile communication terminal 400 can process only an emergency call through the asynchronous communication network of company B.<br>
15	Further,  the  registration of location may also  be denied when the  mobile<br>
communication terminal 400 is located within the asynchronous communication network area of company A. In this case also, the mobile communication terminal 400 switches into an emergency communication state.<br>
In the present embodiment, when the mobile communication terminal 400<br>
20 switches into an emergency communication state due to denial of registration of location by the asynchronous communication network, the mobile communication terminal 400 switches its communication mode into a synchronous mode so that all service can be provided to the mobile communication terminal 400 through the synchronous communication network of company A.<br>
25	FIG. 13 is a flowchart of a method for mode switching according to the seventh<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
As shown in FIG. 13, when the mobile communication terminal 400 tries registration of location (step S610), the mobile communication terminal 400 first determines if an asynchronous signal is detected (step S620).<br>
30	Here,  searching  of the  synchronous  signal  is  performed  when the  mobile<br>
communication terminal 400 is a terminal of the preferred asynchronous mode and is currently in the asynchronous mode. The registration of location includes that of all cases,<br><br>

including registration when the power is on, periodical registration, registration according to movement between cells, etc.<br>
As a result of the determination, when an asynchronous signal is detected, the mobile communication terminal 400 requests registration of location to a corresponding 5 asynchronous communication network (step S630). When the mobile communication terminal 400 receives a location registration reject message in response to the request (step S640), the mobile communication terminal 400 switches into an emergency communication state in which the mobile communication terminal 400 can process only an emergency call (step S650).<br>
10	The location registration reject message may be a message transmitted by the<br>
corresponding asynchronous communication network when the corresponding asynchronous communication network cannot find subscriber information through reference to the information stored in the asynchronous communication network or a message due to some problems in the asynchronous communication network.<br>
15	Then, the mobile communication terminal 400 switches its communication mode<br>
into a synchronous mode (step S660) and detects a synchronous signal and registers its location to the synchronous communication network (step S670), so that the mobile communication terminal 400 can perform the communication through the synchronous communication network.<br>
20	Further, when an asynchronous signal is not detected in step S620, the mobile<br>
communication terminal 400 switches its communication mode into the synchronous mode (step S660) and detects a synchronous signal and registers its location to the synchronous communication network (step S670).<br>
The present invention is applied to only the cases where the communication mode<br>
25 of the mobile communication terminal 400 is set as the preferred asynchronous mode or the preferred synchronous mode and is not applied to the cases where the communication mode of the mobile communication terminal 400 is set as the dedicated asynchronous mode or the dedicated synchronous mode.<br>
Therefore,   it  is  preferred  that,  in  trying  to   register  location,  the   mobile<br>
30 communication terminal 400 checks the current communication mode and searches an asynchronous signal when the current communication mode is the preferred asynchronous mode.<br><br>
WO 2005/086378<br>
In the above description, the mobile communication terminal switches its communication mode into a synchronous mode after switching into an emergency communication state. However, according to the present invention, the mobile communication terminal may switch its communication mode into a synchronous mode 5 upon receiving the location registration reject message from the asynchronous, communication network before entering an emergency communication state, because it is meaningless for the mobile communication terminal to actually enter the emergency communication state.<br>
10        [Industrial Applicability]<br>
As can be seen from the foregoing, the present invention provides a multi-mode multi-band mobile communication terminal and a mode switching method thereof, which can minimize interruption in the communication when the mobile communication terminal moves from an asynchronous mobile communication network area to a synchronous<br>
15     mobile communication network area.<br>
Also, the present invention provides a multi-mode multi-band mobile communication terminal and a mode switching method thereof, which can minimize a ping-pong phenomenon when the mobile communication terminal automatically performs mode switching between a WCDMA mode and a CDMA mode.<br>
20	While this invention has been described in connection with what is presently<br>
considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiment, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiment and the drawings, but, on the contrary, it is intended to cover various modifications and variations within the spirit and scope of the appended claims.<br>
