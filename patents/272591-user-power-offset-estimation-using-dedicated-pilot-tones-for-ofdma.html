USER POWER OFFSET ESTIMATION USING DEDICATED PILOT TONES FOR OFDMA<br>
BACKGROUND Field<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to wireless communication systems, and more particularly to estimation of user power offset in such systems.<br>
Background<br>
[0002] An orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) system utilizes orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), which effectively partitions the overall system bandwidth into a number of (N) orthogonal frequency subbands. These subbands are also referred to as tones, sub-carriers, bins, frequency charmels, and so on. Each subband is associated with a respective sub-carrier that may be modulated with data. An OFDMA system may use any combination of time, frequency, and/or code division multiplexing.<br>
[0003] For an OFDMA system, multiple "traffic" channels may be defined whereby (1) each subband is used for only one traffic channel in any given time interval and (2) each traffic channel may be assigned zero, one, or multiple subbands in each time interval. The traffic channels may include "data" channels used to send traffic/packet data and "control" channels used to send overhead/control data. The traffic charmels may also be referred to as physical charmels, transport channels, or some other terminology.<br>
[0004] The traffic channels for each sector may be defined to be orthogonal to one another in time and frequency so that no two traffic channels use the same subband in any given time interval. This orthogonality avoids intra-sector interference among multiple transmissions sent simultaneously on multiple traffic channels in the same sector. Some loss of orthogonality may result from various effects such as, for example, inter-carrier interference (ICI) and inter-symbol interference (ISI).<br>
[0005] In a wireless communication system such as the OFDMA system, it is often necessary to estimate the response of a wireless channel from a transmitter to a receiver. The channel estimate may be used for various purposes such as data detection, time<br><br>
synchronization, frequency correction, spatial processing, rate selection, and so on. Channel estimation is typically performed by transmitting a pilot signal containing pilot symbols that are known a priori by both the transmitter and receiver. The receiver can then estimate the channel gains as a ratio of the received pilot symbols over the known pilot symbols.<br>
[0006] The pilot signal is typically impaired by both noise and interference. These impairments degrade the quality of the channel estimate obtained by the receiver based on the received pilot signal. The noise can come from various sources such as the wireless channel, receiver properties, and so on. Noise impairment can normally be addressed by transmitting the pilot signal in a proper manner and/or for a sufficient period of time such that the receiver can obtain the desired quality for the channel estimate. The interference can result from multiple transmitters transmitting their pilot signals simultaneously. These transmitters may be for different base stations in the system, different antennas of the same base station, and so on. The pilot signal from each transmitter may act as interference to the pilot signals from other transmitters. This pilot interference degrades the quality of the channel estimate.<br>
[0007J It is often desired to estimate the charmel and the level of interference. On the forward link (FL), common pilot symbols are known to have been used. In the OFDMA system, such common pilot symbols are typically scattered over the entire bandwidth shared by all the users. In a traditional single-antenna transmission, such common pilot symbols may be exploited by all the users for the purpose of FL channel estimation. The bandwidth and channel coherence time values that are typical in cellular applications render common pilot tones particularly useful.<br>
[0008] The relative bandwidth efficiency of the common pilot versus dedicated pilot may be made by a comparison between the total number of degrees of freedom in a broadband channel corresponding to the total shared bandwidth, estimated with the common pilot, and the number of degrees of freedom in a narrow-band sub-channel allocated per user times the number of such narrow-band sub-charmels. For bandwidth and charmel coherence time values that are typical in cellular applications, this balances in favor of the common pilot. Nevertheless, the dedicated pilot approach has a number of attractive features.<br><br>
[0009] User power offset provides the average received power of the signal when the transmitted signal has unit power. Conventionally it is assumed that the user power offset is known and is received as an input to a channel estimation block. However, it has not been shown how the user power offset is estimated.<br>
[0010] Thus, there exists a need to provide a method and apparatus of estimating user power offset with dedicated pilot tones for OFDMA.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0011] In one aspect, the present disclosure provides a method of user power offset estimation for a wireless communication system. Dedicated pilot symbols transmitted over at least one time-frequency region for a user are received. Power offset of the user is estimated based on the received dedicated pilot symbols.<br>
[0012] In an additional aspect, the present disclosure provides an apparatus operable in a wireless communication system. The apparatus includes a processor, which is configured to receive dedicated pilot symbols transmitted over at least one time-frequency region for a user and estimate power offset of the user based on the received dedicated pilot symbols. The apparatus further includes a memory coupled to the processor.<br>
[0013] In another aspect, the present disclosure provides an apparatus operable in a wireless communication system. The apparatus includes means for receiving dedicated pilot symbols transmitted over at least one time-frequency region for a user, and means for estimating power offset of the user based on the received dedicated pilot symbols.<br>
[0014] In a further aspect, the present disclosure provides a computer program product, which includes a computer-readable medium. The computer-readable medium includes code for causing a computer to receive dedicated pilot symbols transmitted over at least one time-frequency region for a user, and code for causing the computer to estimate power offset of the user based on the received dedicated pilot symbols.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0016] In certain aspects, the present disclosure provides a user power offset estimation method and apparatus. The user power offset is needed by the channel and interference estimation block for the computation of MMSE (Minimum Mean Square Error) ratios. The present method uses some intermediate outputs of the channel and interference estimation block. Thus, a user power offset estimation block may be embedded in the channel and interference estimation block. This approach is advantageous because the power offset of each user may be computed separately for each tile, using the pilots of the specific tile. Thus, the present method allows the channel estimation to operate properly regardless of the distribution of the received power across the whole bandwidth.<br>
[0017] Since the user power offset estimation block may be embedded in the channel estimation block, it can be regarded as an improvement to the charmel estimation block.<br><br>
However, the power offsets may also be used for other purposes, such as Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) computation.<br>
[0018] Referring to FIG. 1, a multiple access wireless communication system 100 according to one aspect of the present disclosure is illustrated. The present user power offset estimation method may be implemented in the system 100. The multiple access wireless communication system 100 includes multiple access points 142, 144 and 146. An access point provides communication coverage for a respective geographic area. An access point and/or its coverage area may be referred to as a "cell", depending on the context in which the term is used. For example, the multiple access wireless communication system 100 includes multiple cells 102, 104, and 106. To increase capacity, the coverage area of each access point may be partitioned into multiple (e.g., three) sectors. The multiple sectors may be formed by groups of antermas, each responsible for cormnunication with access terminals in a portion of the cell. For example, in the cell 102, anterma groups 112, 114, and 116 each correspond to a different sector, in the cell 104, antenna groups 118, 120, and 122 each correspond to a different sector, and in the cell 106, antenna groups 124, 126, and 128 each correspond to a different sector.<br>
[0019] In each cell one or more access terminals may be in communication with one or more sectors of each access point. For example, access terminals 130 and 132 are in communication with the access point 142, access terminals 134 and 136 are in communication with the access point 144, and access terminals 138 and 140 are in communication with the access point 146.<br>
[0020] For a centralized architecture, a system controller 150 couples to the access points 142, 144 and 146, provides coordination and control for these access points, and further controls the routing of data for the terminals served by these access points. For a distributed architecture, the access points may communicate with one another as needed, e.g., to serve a terminal in coromunication with an access points, to coordinate the usage of subbands, and so on.<br>
[0021] As shown in FIG. 1, the access terminals 130, 132, 134, 136, 138, and 140 are each located in a different portion of its respective cell, relative to each other access<br><br>
terminal in the same cell. Further, each access terminal may be at a different distance from the corresponding antenna groups with which it is communicating. Both of these factors provide situations, due to environmental and other conditions in the cell, which may cause different channel conditions to be present between each access terminal and the corresponding antenna group with which it is communicating.<br>
[0022] As used herein, an access point (AP) may be a fixed station used for communicating with the terminals and may also be referred to as, and include some or all the functionality of, a base station, a Node B, or some other terminology. An access terminal (AT) may also be referred to as, and include some or all the fiinctionality of, a user equipment (UE), a wireless communication device, a terminal, a mobile station or some other terminology.<br>
[0023] Referring to FIG. 2, a transmitter system 210 and a receiver system 250 in a multiple access wireless communication system 200 in accordance with an aspect of the present disclosure are illustrated. The present user power offset estimation method may be implemented in the system 200. At the transmitter system 210, traffic data for a number of data streams is provided from a data source 212 to a transmit (TX) data processor 214. In an embodiment, each data stream is transmitted over a respective transmit anterma. TX data processor 214 formats, codes, and interleaves the traffic data for each data stream based on a particular coding scheme selected for that data stream to provide coded data. In some embodiments, TX data processor 214 applies precoding weights to the symbols of the data streams based upon the user and the antenna from which the symbols are being transmitted. In some embodiments, the precoding weights may be generated based upon an index to a codebook generated at a transceiver 254 and provided as feedback to a transceiver 222 which has knowledge of the codebook and its indices. Further, in those cases of scheduled transmissions, the TX data processor 214 can select the packet format based upon rank information that is transmitted from the user.<br>
[0024] The coded data for each data stream may be multiplexed with pilot data using OFDM techniques. The pilot data is typically a known data pattern that is processed in a known manner and may be used at the receiver system to estimate the channel response. The multiplexed pilot and coded data for each data stream is then modulated<br><br>
(i.e., symbol mapped) based on a particular modulation scheme (e.g., BPSK, QSPK, M-PSK, or M-QAM) selected for that data stream to provide modulation symbols. The data rate, coding, and modulation for each data stream may be determined by instructions performed by the processor 230. As discussed above, in some embodiments, the packet format for one or more streams may be varied according to the rank information that is transmitted from the user.<br>
[00251 The modulation symbols for all data streams are then provided to a TX MIMO processor 220, which may further process the modulation symbols (e.g., for OFDM). TX MIMO processor 220 then provides Nj modulation symbol streams to NT transceivers (TMTR) 222a through 222t. In certain embodiments, TX MIMO processor 220 applies precoding weights to the symbols of the data streams based upon the user to which the symbols are being transmitted to and the antenna from which the symbol is being transmitted from that user channel response information.<br>
[0026] Each transceiver 222 receives and processes a respective symbol stream to provide one or more analog signals, and further conditions (e.g., amplifies, filters, and upconverts) the analog signals to provide a modulated signal suitable for transmission over the MIMO channel. Nx modulated signals from transceivers 222a through 222t are then transmitted from NT antennas 224a through 224t, respectively. A MIMO channel formed by the NT transmit and NR receive antennas may be decomposed into Ns independent channels, with A^^ 
may also be referred to as a spatial subchannel (or a transmission channel) of the MIMO channel and corresponds to a dimension.<br>
[0027] At the receiver system 250, the transmitted modulated signals are received by NR antennas 252a through 252r and the received signal from each antenna 252 is provided to a respective transceiver (RCVR) 254. Each transceiver 254 conditions (e.g., filters, amplifies, and downconverts) a respective received signal, digitizes the conditioned signal to provide samples, and further processes the samples to provide a corresponding "received" symbol stream.<br><br>
[0028] An RX data processor 260 then receives and processes the NR received symbol streams from NR transceivers 254 based on a particular receiver processing technique to provide Ny "detected" symbol streams. The processing by RX data processor 260 is described in further detail below. Each detected symbol stream includes symbols that are estimates of the modulation symbols transmitted for the corresponding data stream. RX data processor 260 then demodulates, deinterleaves, and decodes each detected symbol stream to recover the traffic data for the data stream. The processing by RX data processor 260 is complementary to that performed by TX MIMO processor 220 and TX data processor 214 at the transmitter system 210.<br>
[0029] The channel response estimate generated by RX processor 260 may be used to perform space, space/time processing at the receiver, adjust power levels, change modulation rates or schemes, or other actions. RX processor 260 may further estimate the signal-to-noise-and-interference ratios (SNRs) of the detected symbol streams, and possibly other channel characteristics, and provides these quantities to a processor 270. RX data processor 260 or processor 270 may further derive an estimate of the "operating" SNR for the system. Processor 270 then provides estimated channel state information (CSI), which may comprise various types of information regarding the communication link and/or the received data stream. For example, the CSI may comprise only the operating SNR. The CSI is then processed by a TX data processor 278, which also receives traffic data for a number of data streams from a data source 276, modulated by a modulator 280, conditioned by transceivers 254a through 254r, and transmitted back to the transmitter system 210.<br>
[0030] At the transmitter system 210, the modulated signals from the receiver system 250 are received by antennas 224, conditioned by receivers 222, demodulated by a demodulator 240, and processed by a RX data processor 242 to recover the CSI reported by the receiver system. The reported quantized information, e.g. CQI, is then provided to processor 230 and used to (1) determine the data rates and coding and modulation schemes to be used for the data streams, and (2) to generate various controls for TX data processor 214 and TX MIMO processor 220.<br>
1.	System Model<br><br>
[0031] Generally, the transmission bandwidth may be divided into hop regions. The symbols of one hop region are assigned to multiple users and are processed together by the AT or AP for the multiple users assigned to the hop region. One hop region includes the symbols transmitted inA'^^   successive OFDM symbols over the same<br>
contiguous set of A^^. tones. Thus, there are Ng x Nj, symbols in one hop region.  The<br>
hop region is also referred to as a time-frequency region. Depending on the context, a time-frequency region may be a tile or a subtile.<br>
[0032] In certain aspects, there may be Q users that share one hop region. The term "user" is transposable with the term "layer" as used herein in the forward link. In this aspect, a single terminal may correspond to multiple users, as it may transmit multiple streams if it has multiple transmit antennas. However, in some cases, each terminal may only transmit a single layer and thus be one user.<br>
[0033] The vector of received symbols in one hop region, denoted by y, is an NgNj- X1 vector of complex numbers, given by<br>
y^jA^h^-'^-S'^'-fno	(1)<br>
9-1<br>
where the first N-^ elements of y (and all the other vectors in the equation (1)) correspond to the channel for the tones of the first OFDM symbol, and so on. A^^, where q = 1,..., Q, is the power offset of user q, which is needed for the second stage of channel estimation algorithm and may be estimated based on the received pilots. User power offset gives the average received power of the signal when the transmitted signal has imit power. As shown in FIG. 3, conventionally it is assumed that the user power offset A^^ is known and is received as an input to a channel estimation block 302.<br>
However, it has not been shown how the user power offset A^^ is obtained. The present method may uses some intermediate outputs of a charmel and interference estimation block to estimate the user power offset A^^ based on the received pilots. Thus, as shown in FIG. 4, a user power offset estimation block 404 may be embedded in a channel and<br><br>
interference estimation block 402. In addition, the power offsets may be used for other purposes, such as Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) computation.<br>
[0034] In Equation (1), S'"*, where q = \,...,Q, N^N-j. x 1 vector of complex numbers, is the vector of modulation symbols transmitted by user q within one hop region, h''*, q = 1,..., Q, NgNj. X1 vector of complex numbers, is the frequency domain channel of user q .  The channel coefficients h*'' may be assumed independent among users. For<br>
each user, h^^' is generally considered a complex Gaussian function, with a zero mean and a known covariance matrix. Og, NgNj.xl vector of complex numbers, is the CAWGN (which includes the interference), and is assumed to have a zero mean and a covariance matrix cr^I. The noise variance cr^ is unknown.<br>
[0035] In some aspects, the present system model may be used to estimate the channel coefficients of all users and the interference. For this, dedicated pilot symbols are inserted among the data symbols in a give hop region. The estimation may be based on the received pilot symbols and on the knowledge of the statistical properties of the channel.<br>
1.1	Channel Model<br>
[0036] The statistical properties of the channel are assumed known. For each user, the channel coefficients over one hop region may be assumed to be correlated. If this is the case, the following approximations may be accurate enough to be utilized for channel estimation.<br>
1.1.1	Structure of Channel Covariance Matrix<br>
[0037] Practically, the structure of the channel covariance matrix of one user has at most three significant eigenvalues, and the corresponding eigenvectors can be approximated by analytical expressions:<br><br>
£{hu,uf<br><br>
(2)<br><br>
where U,, Vj, U3 are explained below.<br>
[0038] The   following  definition  of the   Kronecker  product   may   be   utilized   in approximating the covariance matrix. Given the vectors a,,^, and b^^,, their Kronecker<br>
product c„„„ := a„,, O b„„, is defined as :<br>
«jb<br><br>
c:=<br><br>
[a,b„a^b^,...,a^b„„a^b„a^b^,...,ajb,„,---,a„b^,a,,bj,...,a„bj	(3)<br><br>
ab<br>
Further the following vectors may be defined:<br><br>
U<br><br>
N5.0 •"<br><br>
[l,...lf<br><br>
A^^xl Vector	(4)<br><br><br><br>
UN.., -<br><br>

UN„. :=<br><br>
-^	[-(7V,-1):2:(A^,-1)]'	iV,xl  vector	(7)<br>
N.iN:-\)<br><br>
[0039] The following 3 vectors of size N^N, x 1 are called approximative eigenvectors<br>
and they are used instead of the real eigenvectors for the estimation of the channel corresponding to the data symbols:<br><br>
U,:=U,.,o®U,_„;	U,:=U^_.o®U^„,;<br><br>
U3:=U^,,,(8.U^„o.<br><br>
In some aspects, it may be that the first eigenvalue is at least one order of magnitude larger than the other two. The structure of the covariance matrix described previously may be utilized to provide the following approximate representation of the channel.<br>
1.1.2	Taylor Approximation of Channel Function<br>
[0040] The channel of each user over the hop region may be written as a random function of time and frequency 
 <br>
(1),<br>
r\t,f)«^'&gt;(t„f,) +<br><br>

d^"'it,f)<br>
dt<br><br>
Co./o)<br><br>
it-to)       (8)<br><br>
Thus, in this approximation, the channel over one hop region may be characterized by three complex parameters.<br>
[0041] If {(Q /O) is defined to be the center of symmetry of the hop region, the channel of one user corresponding to a symbol of coordinates {n^,n.j.) may be written as follows:<br><br>
(i)i<br>
« ^('/)  4-   /?
h"'\n„n,) « «^"' +/?;^'K -«ro) + ;^rK -«.o)<br><br>
(9)<br><br>
where HJQ := {N-j- +1) / 2 and n^^ := (A^^ +1) / 2 are the coordinates of the center of the<br>
hop region, ar^'Ms the DC component, and pS^^ ,P'^'* are the slopes in frequency and time, respectively.<br><br>
1.2<br><br>
Pilot Insertion Scheme<br><br>
[0042] In one aspect, pilot symbols within a hop region are placed in a pattern that satisfies the following conditions: (1) there are a total of Np pilot symbols in one hop region; (2) the pilot symbols are grouped in  4 clusters, each cluster having  MQ<br><br>
symbols; thus Np = 4MQ ; (3) the pilot symbols of one cluster occupy a contiguous<br>
region in the time-frequency domain, such that, for each user, the variations of the channel within the symbols of one cluster are as small as possible; and (4) the pilot placement scheme is symmetric with respect to the center of symmetry of the hop region. In certain aspects, the number of users that share one hop region does not exceed the cluster size: O 
disposed among data symbols in a time-frequency region in accordance with exemplary aspects of the present disclosure. As shown in FIG. 5 A, 4 pilot symbols in 4 clusters are dispersed among 60 data tones in an 8 x 8 subtile 502, where Nj, = 4, and MQ =1.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5B, 8 pilot symbols in 4 clusters are dispersed among 56 data tones in an 8 X 8 subtile 504, where Np - 8, and M^y =2.   As shown in FIG. 5C, 12 pilot<br>
symbols in 4 clusters are dispersed among 52 data tones in an 8 x 8 subtile 506, where<br>
Np = 12, and My -3.<br>
[0043J To allow multiplexing, the pilot symbols of one user that belong to the same cluster are scrambled with a scrambling sequence; for simplicity, each user uses the same scrambling sequence for all clusters. The scrambling sequences of different users are orthogonal vectors of length M^^ and are assumed to have unit modulus elements.<br>
There can be at most M^ such sequences, denoted by s^, A: = 1,..., M^,.<br>
[0044] The Npx\ vector of pilot symbols transmitted by user q can be written as:<br>
r,,,:=-=!,,, ®s„	(10)<br>
v   /■■<br>
where l/^,.,<iis a column vector with ones and denotes the kronecker product. vectors r q="\,...,Q," are orthonormal. define followinga x complex .></iis>

The fact that, for each cluster, the scrambling sequences of users are orthogonal plays a role in the derivation of the algorithm.<br>
2.	Channel &amp; interference estimation algorithm with embedded power offset<br>
estimation<br>
2.1       Interference Estimation<br>
[0045] In one aspect, the information about the power of the interference is obtained using only the received pilot symbols. The observation space has A^^ dimensions, and the channel of each user is given by three parameters. Thus, the remaining Np - 3Q dimensions of the observation space may be used to obtain information about the power of the interference. Thus, in FIG 5A, Np -3Q (i.e., 4-3 = 1) dimension of the observation space may be used to obtain information about the power of the interference; in FIG 5B, Np - ZQ (i.e., 8-6 = 2) dimensions of the observation space may be used to obtain information about the power of the interference; and in FIG 5C, Np -3Q (i.e., 12-9 = 3) dimensions of the observation space may be used to obtain information about the power of the interference.<br>
[0046] The interference is estimated as the power of the projection of the received signal on the dimensions unoccupied by the transmitted pilot signals. In other words, the received signal x is projected onto the basis r,^, / = !,...,4, q = l,...,MQ defined in<br>
Equation (11), and the power of the components corresponding to the interference is summed. If w ^ ^ is defined as<br><br>
^i.<i></i>
 <br>
(12)<br><br>
the power of the interference may be estimated by averaging the power of the samples obtained:<br><br>
1	(Q.	.2	'     ^1	,2^<br><br>
y<br><br>
(13)<br><br>
The first sum may be an estimate of the noise power if the channel of each user has perfect linear variation in a tile. In practice however, it includes the channel modeling error.  The second sum exists only if ^ 
despreaded with spreading sequences orthogonal on the sequences of the transmitting users.<br>
2.2       User power offset estimation<br>
[0047] In one aspect, the method used for user power offset estimation is similar to the one used for interference estimation.<br><br>
[0048] This method estimates the power offset of each user as the energy of the projections of the received pilots onto the dimensions occupied by the signal of the user of interest. This estimate may contain the energy of noise on the respective dimensions.<br>
3     , [0049] The interference influence is —a , which, for Np=\2, is the actual noise<br>
level reduced by 6dB. The effect of the interference term is negligible at high SNR, but it may become significant at low SNR.<br>
[0050] A corrected version of the previous estimate is as follows:<br><br>
A^^ = max<br><br>
2      3	^<br>
	 /    \^,a\	O-    ,0<br>
N  '^1   '*'      N	,<br><br>
(15)<br><br>
The maximum is necessary to ensure that the power estimate is non-negative.<br><br>
[0051] The channel estimation algorithm operates independently for each subtile. A more accurate user power offset estimate may be obtained by averaging the results obtained for different subtiles.<br>
[0052] If multiple receive antennas are used, then a more accurate estimate may be obtained by averaging the power offset across receive antermas.<br>
[0053] If less computational effort is required, then only the DC component can be used for power offset estimation :<br><br>
[0054] In one aspect, the channel estimates are given by an approximation to the MMSE estimator:<br>
h'") = Eih^'^x" }{E{XX" })' X	(18)<br>
The following may be obtained:<br>
AM'=Y   2   
The quantities ^, are provided as follows:<br><br><br>
[0055] The values 9j and 0^  are obtained from the actual placement of the pilot<br>
symbols, and they identify the center of the clusters of pilot symbols within a tile. More exactly, the center of the upper-left cluster of pilot symbols may be  given by<br><br>
are in the second "row", then 6j =-3, and so on.<br>
[0056] FIG. 6 is a flowchart of an exemplary method 600 of user power offset estimation for a wireless communication system according to one aspect of the present disclosure. Dedicated pilot symbols transmitted over at least one time-frequency region for a user are received 602. A hop region is also referred to as a time-frequency region. Depending on the context, a time-frequency region may be a tile or a subtile. The at least one time-frequency region may be for a forward link or a reverse link of an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA). A location of one of the at least one time-frequency region may be determined based on a frequency hopping algorithm. The dedicated pilot symbols may be grouped in clusters, where the clusters are symmetrically distributed about a center of one of the at least one time-frequency region. In one aspect, the number of users sharing the one of the at least one time-frequency region may be no greater than the number of dedicated pilot symbols included in one of the clusters.<br>
[0057] Still referring to FIG. 6, power offset of the user may be estimated based on the received dedicated pilot symbols 604. In one aspect, the power offset of the user may be estimated as energy of projections of the received dedicated pilot symbols on dimensions occupied by a signal of the user. For example, the power offset of the user<br><br>
may be estimated using the foregoing-described Equation (14), or the like. In another aspect, the power offset of the user may be estimated as energy of projections of the received dedicated pilot symbols on one dimension occupied by a signal of the user, where the dimension captures most of energy of the signal. For example, the power offset of the user may be estimated using the foregoing-described Equation (16) or (17), or the like. In yet another aspect, the power offset of the user may be estimated based on at least one of the dedicated pilot symbols in one of the at least one time-frequency region. When a SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) is low, the estimated power offset of the user may be corrected 606. In one aspect, the estimated power offset of the user may be corrected based on an estimate of a power of interference. For example, the estimated power offset of the user may be corrected using the foregoing-described Equation (15) or (17), or the like.<br>
[0058] In one aspect, when the wireless communication system includes multiple receive antennas, the power offset may be computed for each of the multiple receive antennas for the user. The computed power offsets may then be averaged across the multiple receive antennas for the user.<br>
[0059] In another aspect, power offsets may be computed for more than one time-frequency region for the user. The computed power offsets may then be averaged across the more than one time-frequency region for the user.<br>
[0060] In yet another aspect, the power offset may be computed for each of the multiple receive antennas for the user when the wireless communication system includes multiple receive antermas. Power offsets may be calculated for more than one time-frequency region for the user. The computed power offsets may be averaged across the multiple receive antermas, and the calculated power offsets may be averaged across the more than one time-frequency region for the user.<br>
