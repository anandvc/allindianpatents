This invention   relates to an improved handcuff lock.<br>
An object of this invention is to provide a locking system for the safety  in  the  house/office and   in   all  other   places where   valuable goods/money  and   other  important articles/documents   can   be   kept.<br>
Another object of this invention is for protection of keeping the valuable articles safety from the unwanted persons, who wants to steal.<br>
Still another object of  this invention for protection of keeping the valuable   articles/goods/documents    beyond   the reach of the   thefts  or unwanted person.<br>
According   to this invention there   is provided a 'Special lock such that if there is an atem of opening the lock with a false and inexact key by thief his hand will be caught automatically by the 'HAND-CUFF'    which will come out from both sides of the hole of  the lock.<br>
This special   lock has special/particular  arrangement in such a way that if a person intends to open the lock with the help of false and inexact key in absence of original keys, he himself will be hand-cuffed.<br>
Thus according to this invention there is provided a lock with safety arrangement with handcuff against opening with false and inexact keys characterized by a locking system in which handcuff of the lock comes out from both sides of the key hole of the lock to catch the hand of the offender using said false and inexact keys wherein the handcuffing system consist of two steel rods pressed against spring held in two pipes and a lock plate having two stoppers is fixed with a special lever of the lock body and a projected pin of the said lever fouls with the said false and inexact keys and the forward movement of steel rods is effected by the release of stoppers of the said lock plate from the grooves provided in the said steel rods.<br>
....2<br><br>
(     2     )<br>
Brief description of the Accompanying<br>
Fig 1- Shows the assembled complete handcuff lock of this invention in the handcuffed position.<br>
Fig 2- Shows the subassembly of steel rod, steel tube, coil spring when the lock is in handcuffed position.<br>
Fig 3- Shows the subassembly of rotatable lever with its projected pin inside the lock body.<br>
Fig4- Shows the original key according to one embodiment of the<br>
invention. It shows that original key has a slot KS the function of which is explained later.<br>
Fig 5- Shows the position of the key in the lock body. It also shows the position of the lock plate in side the lock body.<br>
Fig6- Shows the top view of the handcuff lock assembly in locked position of the hand cuff of fig 1.<br>
Fig7- Shows the side view of one steel tube in the opened position of the handcuff. This shows that the steel rod is in retracted position and the coil spring is under compression.<br>
	3<br><br>
(       3      ;<br>
The handcuff lock consists of two steel rods 1D, a rectangular plate 2A, two steel tubes 1E, a standard lock body LB, a lock plate 2C. Inside the steel tube the steel rod in its retracted position compresses the coil spring. Two additional springs 3A are also shown in fig 1.<br>
Fig2 shows the subassembly of steel tube 1E, steel rods 1D and coil spring S when the steel rods are pushed to its maximum.<br>
Each steel tube has guide slot SL. The slot SL are straight along its length but in the end i,e, in the front side of the tubes they are closer to each other. Each steel rod 1D has grooves G1 &amp; G2 along its length are also shown in fig 2. Section AA, BB, &amp; CC, show different cross sections of the steel tube and steel rod.<br>
The lock plate 2C has two stoppers T as shown in fig3. The lock plate is fixed by threaded screw, which is tightened in the thread of the square shaped spindle of a rotatable lever 2D. The said rotatable lever 2D is mounted inside the lock body LB, thus the movement of the said rotatable plate 2D and the movement of the said lock plate 2C occurs simultaneously.<br>
Fig 4 Shows the original key according to one embodiment of the invention. It shows that original key has a slot KS the function of which is explained later.<br>
Fig 5 shows the position of the said rotatable plate 2D and the original key K inside the lock body LB. The said rotatable plate 2D has a projected pin P from the face of the side, which faces the key K.<br>
...A<br><br>
(	4         )<br>
As shown in fig5 when the said original key K is inserted within the lock body LB to open the lock the projected pin P does not foul with the original key K and the key functions its operation with the lock body LB in its usual way to open the lock. But when a false key which does not have slot arrangement as set out in the original key K is inserted and rotated to open the lock its fouls with the said projected pin P. So when said false key is rotated it tries to rotate the rotatable lever 2D along its rotational axis OO of fig5. The rotation of the said rotatable lever 2D causes the rotation of the lock plate 2C as described earlier. Thus the stoppers T which were engaged in the grooves G1 of the steel rods 1D are released and the coil springs S force the said steel rods 1D to move forward. The slots SL of the tubes 1E guide the movement of the steel rods 1D.<br>
The steel rods 1D rotate in reverse direction due to the special slot arrangement as explained earlier in the two tubes 1E and complete the handcuffing operation. In this position the stopper are engaged in the grooves G2 of the steel rods 1D. This position is shown in fig 6.<br>
The additional spring 3A resist vibration during the forward movement of the steel rods 1D.<br>
Now to open the caught hand of the offender one must use the original key K. The almirah or the vault should be opened fast with the original key K. Than the stopper T of the lock plate 2C are to be released from grooves G2 of the steel rods 1D and thereafter the rods can be pushed backward to release the caught hand of the offender. The steel rods 1D are pushed further to engaged the stopper T of the said lock plate 2Cin the grooves G1 of the steel rods as shown in fig7.<br>
	5<br><br>
(         5        ) I Claim-Claim 1   A lock with safety arrangement with handcuff against opening with false and inexact keys characterized by a locking system in which hand cuff of the lock comes out from both sides of the key hole of the lock to catch the hand of the offender using said false and inexact keys wherein the handcuffing system consists of two steel rods (1D) pressed against springs (S) held in two pipes (1E) and a lock plate (2C) having two stoppers (T) is fixed with a special levers (2D) of the lock body and a projected pin (P) of the said lever (2D) fouls with the said false and inexact keys and the forward movement of steel rods is effected by the release of stoppers (T) of the said lock plate (2C) from the grooves (G2) provided in the said steel rods (1D).<br>
Claim 2      The lock as claimed in claim 1 wherein the lock is supported on a plate 2A.<br>
Claim 3      The lock as claimed in claim 2 provided with spring 3A to resist vibrations during the shocks.<br>
Claim 4      A safety vault or an almirah having a lock with safety arrangement with handcuff as claimed in claim 1.<br>
Claim 5      A lock with safety arrangement with handcuff substantially as herein described with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
This invention relates to a lock with safety arrangement with handcuff against opening with false and inexact keys characterized by a locking system in which hand cuff of the lock comes out from both sides of the key hole of the lock to catch the hand of the offender using said false and inexact keys wherein the handcuffing system consists of two steel rods (1D) pressed against springs (S) held in two pipes (1E) and a lock plate (2C) having two stoppers (T) is fixed with a special levers (2D) of the lock body and a projected pin (P) of the said lever (2D) fouls with the said false and inexact keys and the forward movement of steel rods is effected by the release of stoppers (T) of the said lock plate (2C) from the grooves (G2) provided in the said steel rods (1D).</td>
