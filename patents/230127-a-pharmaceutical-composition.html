				<td>A PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION	 <br>
Background Of The Invention 	<br>
[0001]	The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein (CFTR) is a cAMP-<br>
activated chloride (Cl-) channel expressed in epithelial cells in mammalian airways,<br>
intestine, pancreas and testis. CFTR is the chloride-channel responsible for cAMP-mediated<br>
Cl-' secretion. Hormones, such as a β-adrenergic agonist, or a toxin, such as cholera toxin,<br>
leads to an increase in cAMP, activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and<br>
phosphorylation of the CFTR Cl- channel, which causes the channel to open. An increase in<br>
 cell Ca2+ can also activate different apical membrane channels. Phosphorylation by protein<br>
 kinase C can either open or shut Cl- channels in the apical membrane. CFTR is<br>
 predominantly located in epithelia where it provides a pathway for the movement of Cl- ions<br>
 across the apical membrane and a key point at which to regulate the rate of transepithelial<br>
salt and water transport. CFTR chloride channel function is associated with a wide spectrum<br>
of disease, including cystic fibrosis (CF) and with some forms of male infertility, polycystic<br>
kidney disease and secretory diarrhea.<br>
[0002]	The hereditary lethal disease cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in CFTR.<br>
Observations in human cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and CF mouse models indicate the<br>
functional importance of CFTR in intestinal and pancreatic fluid transport, as well as in male<br>
fertility (Grubb et al, 1999, Physiol. Rev. 79:S193-S214; Wong, P.Y., 1997, Mol Hum.<br>
Reprod. 4:107-110). However, the mechanisms remain unclear by which defective CFTR<br>
produces airway disease, which is the principal cause of morbidity and mortality in CF<br>
(Pilewski et al, 1999, Physiol. Rev. 79:S215-S255). Major difficulties in understanding<br>
airway disease in CF include the inadequacy of CF mouse models, which manifest little or<br>
no airway disease, the lack of large animal models of CF, and the limited availability of<br>
human CF airways that have not been damaged by chronic infection and inflammation.<br>
High-affinity, CFTR-selective inhibitors have not been available to study airway disease<br>
mechanisms in CF or to create the CF phenotype in large animal models.<br>
[0003]	High-affinity CFTR inhibitors also have clinical applications in the therapy of<br>
secretory diarrheas and cystic kidney disease, and in inhibiting male fertility. The<br>
compounds diphenylamine-2-carboxylate (DPC) and 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropyl-<br>
amino)benzoate (NPPB) inhibit CFTR at high concentrations but are non-specific in their <br>
inhibitory action (Cabantchik et al, 1992, Am. J. Physiol 262:C803-C827; McDonough et<br><br>
al, 1994, Neuron 13:623-634; Schultz et al, 1999, Physiol. Rev. 79:S109-S144). The best<br>
CFTR inhibitor available for electrophysiological and other cell-based studies,<br>
glibenclamide, is used at concentrations of &gt;100 μM (Sheppard et al, 1992, J. Gen. Physiol<br>
100:573-591; Hongre et al, 1994, Pflugers Arch. 426:284-287). However, at this<br>
concentration glibenclamide also inhibits other Cl- transporters as well as K+ channels<br>
(Edwards et al, 1993, Br. J. Pharmacol 110:1280-1281; Rabe et al, 1995, Pflugers Arch.<br>
429:659-662; Yamazaki et al, 1997, Circ. Res. 81:101-109). Effective small molecule<br>
inhibitors of other ion transport proteins are known, but no small molecules with specific<br>
CFTR inhibitory ability suitable for therapy of secretory diseases have been available.<br>
[0004]	There is accordingly a need for CTFR inhibitor compounds and methods of using<br>
such compounds for development of animal models useful in the study and treatment of CF<br>
and the treatment and control of secretory disorders. The present invention addresses these<br>
needs, as well as others, and overcomes deficiencies found in the background art.<br>
Summary Of The Invention<br>
[0005]	The invention provides compositions, pharmaceutical preparations and methods for<br>
inhibition of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein (CFTR) that are<br>
useful for the study and treatment of CFTR-mediated diseases and conditions. The<br>
compositions and pharmaceutical preparations of the invention may comprise one or more<br>
thiazolidinone compounds or derivatives, and may additionally comprise one or more<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients and/or adjuvants. The methods of the<br>
invention comprise, in certain embodiments, administering to a patient suffering from a<br>
CFTR-mediated disease or condition, an efficacious amount of a thiazolidinone compound<br>
or derivative. In other embodiments the invention provides methods of inhibiting CFTR that<br>
comprise contacting cells in a subject with an effective amount of a thiazolidinone<br>
compound or derivative. In addition, the invention features a non-human animal model of<br>
CFTR-mediated disease which model is produced by administration of a thiazolidinone<br>
compound or derivative to a non-human animal in an amount sufficient to inhibit CFTR.<br>

Detailed Description Of The Invention<br>
[0044]	The invention is based on the discovery of thiazolidinone compounds and derivatives<br>

DEFINITIONS<br>
[0045]	A "cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein-mediated condition<br>
or symptom" or "CFTR-mediated condition or symptom" means any condition, disorder or<br>
disease, or symptom of such condition, disorder, or disease, that results from activity of<br>
cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein (CFTR), e.g., activity of CFTR<br>
in ion transport. Such conditions, disorders, diseases, or symptoms thereof are treatable by<br>
inhibition of CFTR activity, e.g., inhibition of CFTR ion transport. CFTR activity has been<br>
implicated in, for example, intestinal secretion in response to various agonists, including<br>
cholera toxin (see, e.g., Snyder et al. 1982 Bull. World Health Organ. 60:605-613; Chao et<br>
al. 1994 EMBO J. 13:1065-1072; Kimberg et al. 1971 J. Clin. Invest.50:1218-1230).<br>
[0046]	A "CFTR inhibitor" as used herein is a compound that reduces the efficiency of ion .<br>
transport by CFTR, particularly with respect to transport of chloride ions by CFTR.<br>
Preferably CFTR inhibitors of the invention are specific CFTR inhibitors, i.e., compounds<br>
that inhibit CFTR activity without significantly or adversely affecting activity of other ion<br>
transporters, e.g., other chloride transporters, potassium transporters, and the like. Preferably<br>

disorder or symptom in a subject, wherein the disease, condition, disorder or symptom is<br>
mediated by the activity of CFTR, and includes: (1) preventing the disease, condition, or<br>
disorder, i.e. causing the clinical symptoms of the disease not to develop in a subject that<br>
may be exposed to or predisposed to the disease, condition, or disorder, but does not yet<br>
experience or display symptoms thereof, (2) inhibiting the disease, condition or disorder, i.e.,<br>
arresting or reducing the development of the disease, condition or disorder, or its clinical<br>

that the alkyl may, but need not, be present, and the description includes situations where the<br>
heterocyclo group is mono- or disubstituted with an alkyl group and situations where the<br>
heterocyclo group is not substituted with the alkyl group.<br>
[0077]	The term "electron-withdrawing group" refers to the ability of a functional group on<br>
a molecule to draw electrons to itself more than a hydrogen atom would if the hydrogen<br><br><br>
atom occupied the same position in the molecule. Examples of electron-withdrawing groups<br>

and the like.<br>
[0078]	Compounds that have the same molecular formula but differ in the nature or<br>
sequence of bonding of their atoms or the arrangement of their atoms in space are termed<br>
. "isomers." Isomers that differ in the arrangement of their atoms in space are termed<br>
"stereoisomers." Stereoisomers that are not mirror images of one another are termed<br>
"diastereomers" and those that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other are<br>
termed "enantiomers." When a compound has an asymmetric center, for example, it is<br>
bonded to four different groups, a pair of enantiomers is possible. An enantiomer can be<br>
characterized by the absolute configuration of its asymmetric center and is described by the<br>
R- and S-sequencing rules of Cahn and Prelog, or by the manner in which the molecule<br>
rotates the plane of polarized light and designated as dextrorotatory or levorotatory (i.e., as<br>
(+) or (-)-isomers respectively). A chiral compound can exist as either an individual<br>
enantiomer or as a mixture of thereof. A mixture containing equal proportions of the<br>
enantiomers is called a "racemic mixture."<br>
[0079]	The compounds of this invention may possess one or more asymmetric centers; such<br>
compounds can therefore be produced as individual (R)- or (S)- stereoisomers or as mixtures<br>
thereof. Unless indicated otherwise, the description or naming of a particular compound in<br>
the specification and claims is intended to include both individual enantiomers and mixtures,<br>
racemic or otherwise, thereof. The methods for the determination of stereochemistry and the<br>
separation of stereoisomers are well-known in the art (see, e.g., the discussion in Chapter 4<br>
of "Advanced Organic Chemistry", 4th edition J. March, John Wiley and Sons, New York,<br>
1992).<br>
OVERVIEW<br>
[0080]	The invention provides thiazolidinone compositions, thiazohdinone derivatives<br>
compositions and methods of their use in high affinity inhibition of cystic fibrosis<br>
transmembrane conductance regulator protein (CFTR) and for the study and treatment of<br>
CFTR-mediated diseases and conditions. The discovery of the subject thiazohdinone<br>
compounds and derivatives was based on screening of numerous potential candidate<br><br><br>
compounds using an assay designed to identify CFTR inhibitors that interact directly with<br>
CFTR. Without being held to any particular theory or mode of operation, since multiple<br>
CFTR activators that work on different activating pathways were included in the studies<br>
leading to identification of the subject compounds, the inhibitory compounds of the<br>
invention likely effect inhibition by acting at or near the CFTR Cl- transporting pathway. A<br>
screening of 50,000 diverse compounds identified several 2-thioxo-4-thiazolidinone<br>
compounds and derivatives as effective CFTR inhibitors. These compounds and derivatives<br>
are unrelated chemically and structurally to previously known CFTR activators or to the<br>
previously known CFTR inhibitors DPC, NPPB or glibenclamide. The most potent CFTR<br>
inhibitor identified from screening had a KI of~300 nM for inhibition of Cl- current in<br>
human airway cells. Inhibition was rapid, reversible and CFTR-specific.<br>
[0081]	The compositions and methods of the invention will now be described in more detail.<br>

PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATIONS<br>
[0087]	Also provided by the invention are pharmaceutical preparations of the subject<br>
thiazolidinone compounds described above. The subject compounds can be incorporated into<br>
a variety of formulations for therapeutic administration by a variety of routes. More<br>
particularly, the compounds of the present invention can be formulated into pharmaceutical<br>
compositions by combination with appropriate, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers,<br>
diluents, excipients and/or adjuvants, and may be formulated into preparations in solid, semi-<br>
solid, liquid or gaseous forms, such as tablets, capsules, powders, granules, ointments,<br>
solutions, suppositories, injections, inhalants and aerosols. Preferably, the formulations are<br>
free of detectable DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide), which is not a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carrier, diluent, excipient, or adjuvant for non-topical, parenteral administration or enteral<br>
administration. The formulations may be designed for adrninistration to subjects or patients<br>
in need thereof via a number of different routes, including oral, buccal, rectal, parenteral,<br>

[0088]	In one embodiment, topical administration (e.g., by transdermal administration) is of<br>
interest. Topical formulations can be in the form of a transdermal patch, ointment, paste,<br>
lotion, cream, gel, and the like. Topical formulations may include one or more of a<br>
penetrating agent, thickener, diluent, emulsifier, dispersing aid, or binder. Where the<br>
compound is formulated for transdermal delivery, the compound may be formulated with or<br>
for use with a penetration enhancer. Penetration enhancers, which include chemical<br><br><br><br>
penetration enhancers and physical penetration enhancers, facilitate delivery of the<br>
compound through the skin, and may also be referred to as "permeation enhancers"<br>
interchangeably. Physical penetration enhancers include, for example, electrophoretic<br>
techniques such as iontophoresis, use of ultrasound (or "phonophoresis"), and the like.<br>
Chemical penetration enhancers are agents administered either prior to, with, or immediately<br>
following compound administration, which increase the permeability of the skin, particularly<br>
the stratum corneum, to provide for enhanced penetration of the drug through the skin.<br>
[0089]	Compounds that have been used to enhance skin permeability include: the sulfoxides<br>
dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and decylmethylsulfoxide (C10 MSO); ethers such as diethylene<br>
glycol monoethyl ether, dekaoxyethylene-oleylether, and diethylene glycol monomethyl<br>
ether; surfactants such as sodium laurate, sodium lauryl sulfate, cetyltrimethylammonium<br>
bromide, benzalkonium chloride, Poloxamer (231,182,184), Tween (20,40,60,80) and<br>
lecithin; the 1-substituted azacycloheptan-2-ones, particularly 1-n-<br>
dodecylcyclazaeycloheptan-2-one; alcohols such as ethanol, propanol, octanol, benzyl<br>
alcohol, and the like; petrolatums, such as petroleum jelly (petrolatum), mineral oil (liquid<br>
petrolatum), and the like; fatty acids such as C8-C22 and other fatty acids (e.g., isostearic<br>
acid, octanoic acid, oleic acid, lauric acid, valeric acid); C8-C22 fatty alcohols (e.g., oleyl<br>
alcohol, lauryl alcohol); lower alkyl esters of C8-C22 fatty acids and other fatty acids (e.g.,<br>
ethyl oleate, isopropyl myristate, butyl stearate, methyl laurate, isopropyl myristate,<br>
isopropyl palmitate, methylpropionate, ethyl oleate); monoglycerides of C8-C22 fatty acids<br>
(e.g., glyceryl monolaurate); tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol polyethylene glycol ether; 2-(2-<br>
ethoxyethoxy)ethanol; diethylene glycol monomethyl ether; alkylaryl ethers of polyethylene<br>
oxide; polyethylene oxide monomethyl ethers; polyethylene oxide dimethyl ethers; di-lower<br>
alkyl esters of C6-C8 diacids (e.g., diisopropyl adipate); ethyl acetate; acetoacetic ester;<br>
polyols and esters thereof such as propylene glycol, ethylene glycol, glycerol, butanediol,<br>
polyethylene glycol, and polyethylene glycol monolaurate; amides and other nitrogenous<br>
compounds such as urea, dimethylacetamide (DMA), dimethylformamide (DMF), 2-<br>

amine and triemanolamine; terpenes; alkanones, and organic acids, particularly salicylic acid<br>
and salicylates, citric acid and succinic acid. Additional chemical and physical penetration<br>
enhancers are described in, for example, Transdermal Delivery of Drugs, A. F. Kydonieus<br>

[0090]	Where the compound is formulated with a chemical penetration enhancer, the<br>
penetration enhancer is selected for compatibility with the compound, and is present in an<br>
amount sufficient to facilitate delivery of the compound through skin of a subject, e.g., for<br>
delivery of the compound to the systemic circulation, In one embodiment, the compound is<br>
formulated with a penetration enhancer other than DMSO.<br>
[0091]	In one embodiment, the compound is provided in a drug delivery patch, e.g., a<br>
transmucosal or transdermal patch, and can be formulated with a penetration enhancer. The<br>
patch generally includes a backing layer, which is impermeable to the compound and other<br>
formulation components, a matrix in contact with one side of the backing layer, which<br>
matrix provides for sustained release, which may be controlled release, of the compound,<br>
and an adhesive layer, which is on the same side of the backing layer as the matrix. The<br>
matrix can be selected as is suitable for the route of administration, and can be, for example,<br>
and can be a polymeric or hydrogel matrix.<br>
[0092]	In pharmaceutical dosage forms, the subject compounds of the invention may be<br>
administered in the form of their pharmaceutically acceptable derivative, such as a salt, or<br>
they may also be used alone or in appropriate association, as well as in combination, with<br>
other pharmaceutically active compounds. The following methods and excipients are merely<br>
exemplary and are in no way limiting.<br>
[0093]	For oral preparations, the subject compounds can be used alone or in combination<br>
with appropriate additives to make tablets, powders, granules or capsules, for example, with<br>
conventional additives, such as lactose, mannitol, com starch or potato starch; with binders,<br>
such as crystalline cellulose, cellulose derivatives, acacia, corn starch or gelatins; with<br>
disintegrators, such as corn starch, potato starch or sodium carboxymethylcellulose; with<br>
lubricants, such as talc or magnesium stearate; and if desired, with diluents, buffering agents,<br>
moistening agents, preservatives and flavoring agents. Of particular interest is formulation of<br>
the subject thiazolidinone compounds with a buffering agent, to provide for protection of the<br>
compound from low pH of the gastric environment. It may also be preferable to provide an<br>
enteric coating so as to avoid precipitation of the compound while in transit through the<br>
stomach.<br><br><br>
(0094]	The subject compounds of the invention can be formulated into preparations for<br>
injection by dissolving, suspending or emulsifying them in an aqueous or nonaqueous<br>
solvent, such as vegetable or other similar oils, synthetic aliphatic acid glycerides, esters of<br>
higher aliphatic acids or propylene glycol; and if desired, with conventional additives such<br>
as solubilizers, isotonic agents, suspending agents, emulsifying agents, stabilizers and<br>
preservatives. Solubilizers of particular interest include vitamin E TPGS (d-a-tocopheryl<br>
polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate), cyclodextrins, and the like.<br>
[0095]	The compounds of the invention can be utilized in aerosol formulation to be<br>
administered via inhalation. The compounds of the present invention can be formulated into<br>
pressurized acceptable propellants such as dichlorodifluoromethane, propane, nitrogen and<br>
the like.<br>
[0096]	Furthermore, the subject compounds can be made into suppositories by mixing with a<br>
variety of bases such as emulsifying bases or water-soluble bases. The compounds of the<br>
present invention can be administered rectally via a suppository. The suppository can include<br>
vehicles such as cocoa butter, carbowaxes and polyethylene glycols, which melt at body<br>
temperature, yet are solidified at room temperature.<br>
[0097]	Unit dosage forms for oral or rectal administration such as syrups, elixirs, and<br>
suspensions may be provided wherein each dosage unit, for example, teaspoonful,<br>
tablespoonful, tablet or suppository, contains a predetermined amount of the composition<br>
containing one or more inhibitors. Similarly, unit dosage forms for injection or intravenous<br>
administration may comprise the inhibitors) in a composition as a solution in sterile water,<br>
normal saline or another pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
[0098]	Depending on the subject and condition being treated and on the administration<br>
route, the subject compounds may be administered in dosages of, for example, 0.1 p.g to 10<br>
mg/kg body weight per day. The range is broad, since in general the efficacy of a therapeutic<br>
effect for different mammals varies widely with doses typically being 20,30 or even 40<br>
times smaller (per unit body weight) in man than in the rat. Similarly the mode of<br>
administration can have a large effect on dosage. The inventors have found that cholera<br>
toxin-induced intestinal fluid secretion in mice is effectively blocked by a single<br>
intraperitoneal dose of about 10-20 micrograms with a dosage of about ten times greater<br>
being effective in rats. Thus, for example, oral dosages may be about ten times the injection<br>
dose. Higher doses may be used for localized routes of delivery.<br>
[0099]	A typical dosage may be a solution suitable for intravenous administration; a tablet<br>
taken from two to six times daily, or one time-release capsule or tablet taken once a day and<br><br><br>
containing a proportionally higher content of active ingredient, etc. The time-release effect<br>
may be obtained by capsule materials that dissolve at different pH values, by capsules that<br>
release slowly by osmotic pressure, or by any other known means of controlled release.<br>
[00100]	FOT use in the subject methods, the subject compounds may be formulated with other<br>
pharmaceutically active agents, including other CFTR-inhibiting agents.<br>
[00101]	Pharmaceutically acceptable excipients usable with the invention, such as vehicles,<br>
adjuvants, carriers or diluents, are readily available to the public. Moreover,<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliary substances, such as pH adjusting and buffering agents,<br>
tonicity adjusting agents, stabilizers, wetting agents and the like, are readily available to the<br>
public.<br>
[00102]	Those of skill in the art will readily appreciate that dose levels can vary as a function<br>
of the specific compound, the severity of the symptoms and the susceptibility of the subject<br>
to side effects. Preferred dosages for a given compound are readily determinable by those of<br>
skill in the art by a variety of means.<br>
[00103]	Kits with unit doses of the subject compounds, usually in oral or injectable doses, are<br>
provided. In such kits, in addition to the containers containing the unit doses will be an<br>
informational package insert describing the use and attendant benefits of the drugs in treating<br>
pathological condition of interest. Preferred compounds and unit doses are those described<br>
herein above.<br>
CONDITIONS AMENABLE TO TREATMENT USING THE CFTR INHIBITORS OF THE<br>
INVENTION<br>
[00104]	The CFTR inhibitors disclosed herein are useful in the treatment of a CFTR-<br>
mediated condition, i.e., any condition, disorder or disease, or symptom of such condition,<br>
disorder, or disease, that results from activity of CFTR, e.g., activity of CFTR in ion<br>
transport. Such conditions, disorders, diseases, or symptoms thereof are amenable to<br>
treatment by inhibition of CFTR activity, e.g., inhibition of CFTR ion transport.<br>
[00105]	In one embodiment, the CFTR inhibitors of the invention are used in the treatment of<br>
conditions associated with aberrantly increased intestinal secretion, particularly acute<br>
aberrantly increased intestinal secretion. CFTR activity has been implicated in intestinal<br>
secretion in response to various agonists, including cholera toxin (see, e.g., Snyder et al.<br>
1982 Bull. World Health Organ. 60:605-613; Chao et al 1994 EMBO J. 13:1065-1072;<br>
Kimberg et al. 1971 J. Clin. Invest.50:1218-1230). Thus CFTR inhibitors of the invention<br><br><br>
can be administered in an amount effective to inhibit CFTR ion transport and thus decrease<br>
intestinal fluid secretion.<br>
[001061	Thus, CFTR inhibitors can be used in the treatment of intestinal inflammatory<br>
disorders and diarrhea, particularly secretory diarrhea. Secretory diarrhea is the biggest cause<br>
of infant death in developing countries, with about 5 million deaths annually (Gabriel et al.,<br>
1994 Science 266:107-109). Several studies, including those using CF mice, indicate that<br>
CFTR is the final common pathway for intestinal chloride ion (and thus fluid) secretion in<br>
response to various agonists (Snyder et al, 1982, Bull World Health Organ. 60:605-613;<br>
Chao et al., 1994 EMBO. J. 13:1065-1072; and Kimberg et al, 1971,J Clin. Invest. 50:<br>
1218-1230). The mouse models of intestinal fluid secretion used herein indicate that CFTR<br>
inhibition by systemic administration of the inhibitor at a non-toxic dose effectively blocked<br>
intestinal fluid secretion induced by cholera toxin (see Examples).<br>
[00107]	Diarrhea that may be amenable to treatment using the CFTR inhibitors of the<br>
invention can result from exposure to a variety of pathogens or agents including, without<br>
limitation, cholera toxin (Vibrio cholera), E. coli (particularly enterotoxigenic (ETEC)),<br>
Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter, Clostridium difficile, parasites (e.g., Giardia,<br>
Entamoeba histolytica, Cryptosporidiosis, Cyclospora), diarrheal viruses (e.g., rotavirus),<br>
food poisoning, or toxin exposure that results in increased intestinal secretion mediated by<br>
CFTR.<br>
[00108]	Other diarrheas include diarrhea associated with AIDS (e.g., AIDS-related diarrhea),<br>
and inflammatory gastrointestinal disorders, such as ulcerative colitis, inflammatory bowel<br>
disease (IBD), Crohn's disease, and the like. It has been reported that intestinal inflammation<br>
modulates the expression of three major mediators of intestinal salt transport and may<br>
contribute to diarrhea in ulcerative colitis both by increasing transepithelial Cl- secretion and<br>
by inhibiting the epithelial NaCl absorption (see, e.g., Lohi et al, 2002, Am. J. Physiol.<br>
Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 283(3):G567-75).<br>
[00109]	CFTR inhibitors of the invention can also be used in treatment of conditions such as<br>
polycystic kidney disease, and find further use as male infertility drugs, by inhibition of<br>
CFTR activity in the testis.<br>
[00110]	CFTR inhibitors of the invention can be further screened in larger animal models<br>
(e.g., the rabbit model described in Spira et al, 1981, Infect. Immun. 32:739-747.). In<br>
addition, analysis of stool output using live Vibrio cholerae can also be examined to further<br>
characterize the CFTR inhibitors of the invention.<br><br><br>
NON-HUMAN ANIMAL MODELS AND HUMAN TISSUE MODELS OF CFTR-DEFICIENCIES<br>
[00111]	The CFTR inhibitors of the invention can also be used to generate non-human animal<br>
models of disease, where the disease is associated with decreased CFTR function (e.g.,<br>
decreased ion transport). There is increasing evidence that defective fluid and<br>
macromolecular secretion by airway submucosal glands leads to impaired mucociliary and<br>
bacterial clearance in CFTR-deficient subjects, particularly in those affected with cystic<br>
fibrosis (CF); however, functional studies in human airway glands have been restricted to<br>
severely diseased airways obtained at the time of lung transplantation (Jayararnan et al. 2001<br>
Proc. Natl Acad. Sci USA 98:8119-8123). Acute CFTR inhibition permits determination of<br>
the role of CFTR in water, salt and macromolecule secretion by submucosal glands. High-<br>
affinity CFTR inhibitors permit the pharmacological creation of non-human animal models<br>
that mimic CFTR-deficiency in humans, e.g., mimics the human CF phenotype. In<br>
particular, large animal models of CFTR deficiency (e.g., CF) find particular use in<br>
elucidating the pathophysiology of initiation and progression of airway disease in CF, and in<br>
evaluating the efficacy of CF therapies, e.g., screening candidate agents for treatment of<br>
CFTR-deficiencies or symptoms thereof.<br>
[00112]	Inhibition of CFTR ion transport can be manifested in airway and pancreatic<br>
disorders, as well as infertility in males. For example, inhibition of CFTR channels in the<br>
lungs and airways influences airway surface fluids leading to accumulation of mucus, which<br>
in turn plugs airways and collects heavily on the lung walls, providing a prime environment<br>
for infection to occur, which in turn can lead to chronic lung disease. This same phenomenon<br>
occurs in the pancreas, where the accumulated mucus disrupts the exocrine function of the<br>
pancreas and prevents essential food-processing enzymes from reaching the intestines.<br>
[00113] Such non-human animal models can be generated by administration of an amount of<br>
a CFTR inhibitor effective to decrease CFTR activity in ion transport. Of particular interest<br>
is the use of the CFTR inhibitors of the invention to induce the cystic fibrosis (CF)<br>
phenotype in a non-human animal. Administration of an amount of a CFTR inhibitor<br>
effective to inhibit CFTR receptors in, for example, lung effectively mimics the CFTR defect<br>
found in CF. Routes of delivery for CFTR inhibitor are discussed in detail above. Depending<br>
on the non-human animal used, the subject compounds may be administered in dosages of,<br>
for example, 50 to 500 µg/kg body weight one to three times a day by an intraperitoneal,<br>
subcutaneous, or other route to generate the non-human animal models. Oral dosages may be<br>
up to about ten times the intraperitoneal or subcutaneous dose.<br><br><br>
[00114]	Non-human animal models of CFTR-associated disease can be used as models of any<br>
appropriate condition associated with decreased CFTR activity. Such conditions include<br>
those that are associated with CFTR mutations, which mutations result in abnormalities in<br>
epithelial ion and water transport. These abnormalities can in turn be associated with<br>
derangements in airway mucociliary clearance, as well as in other mucosal epithelia and<br>
ductal epithelia. Conditions that can be pharmacologically modeled by inducing a CFTR-<br>
deficient phenotype in a non-human animal include, without limitation, cystic fibrosis<br>
(including atypical CF), idiopathic chronic pancreatitis, vas deferens defects, mild<br>
pulmonary disease, asthma, and the like. For a review of disorders associated with impaired<br>
CFTR function, see, e.g., Noone et al RespirRes 2 328-332 (2001). CFTR inhibitor-<br>
generated non-human animal models can also serve as models of microbial infection (e.g.,<br>
bacterial, viral, or fungal infection, particularly respiratory infections) in a CFTR-deficient<br>
subject. In one embodiment of particular interest, the CFTR inhibitors of the invention are<br>
used to pharmacologically induce the cystic fibrosis (CF) phenotype.<br>
[00115]	Animals suitable for use in the production of the animal models of the invention<br>
include any animal, particularly a mammal, e.g., non-human primates (e.g., monkey,<br>
chimpanzee, gorilla, and the like), rodents (e.g., rats, mice, gerbils, hamsters, ferrets, and the<br>
like), lagomorphs, swine (e.g., pig, rniniature pig), equine, canine, feline, and the like. Large<br>
animals are of particular interest.<br>
[00116]	The CFTR inhibitors can also be contacted with isolated human tissue to create ex<br>
vivo models of disease. Such tissue is contacted with an amount of a CFTR inhibitor<br>
effective to decrease CFTR activity in the tissue, which may be for as little as 15 minutes, or<br>
as much as two hours or more. Human tissues of interest include, without limitation, lung<br>
(including trachea and airways), liver, pancreas, testis, and the like. Physiological,<br>
biochemical, genomic or other studies can be carried out on the inhibitor-treated tissue to<br>
identify novel therapeutic target molecules that are important in the pathophysiology of a<br>
disease. For example, isolated tissue from humans without CF can be exposed to inhibitor<br>
sufficient to induce the CF phenotype and such studies can be carried out to identify novel<br>
therapeutic target molecules that are important in the pathophysiology of CF.<br>
SYNTHESIS OF THE COMPOUNDS OF THE INVENTION<br>
[00117]	Compounds of the invention may be prepared according to methods known to one<br>
skilled in the art, or by the methods similar to those disclosed in US 5,326,770 and US<br><br><br>
6,380,186 (all of which are incorporated in full by reference herein), or by methods similar<br>
to the method described below.<br>
[00118]	It is understood that in the following description, combinations of substituents and/or<br>
variables of the depicted formulae are permissible only if such contributions result in stable<br>
compounds.<br>
[00119]	It will also be appreciated by those skilled in the art that in the process described<br>
below the functional groups of intermediate compounds may need to be protected by suitable<br>
protecting groups. Such functional groups include hydroxy, amino, mercapto and carboxylic<br>
acid. Suitable protecting groups for hydroxy include trialkylsilyl or diarylalkylsilyl (e.g.,<br>
t-butyldimethylsilyl, t-butyldiphenylsilyl or trimethylsilyl), tetrahydropyranyl, benzyl, and<br>
the like. Suitable protecting groups for amino, amidino and guanidino include<br>
t-butoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, and the like. Suitable protecting groups for mercapto<br>
include -C(0)-R (where R is alkyl, aryl or aralkyl),p-methoxybenzyl, trityl and the like.<br>
Suitable protecting groups for carboxylic acid include alkyl, aryl or aralkyl esters.<br>
[00120]	Protecting groups may be added or removed in accordance with standard techniques,<br>
which are well-known to those skilled in the art and as described herein.<br>
[00121]	The use of protecting groups is described in detail in Theodora W. Greene, Peter G.<br>
M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis (1999), 3rd Ed., Wiley-Interscience. The<br>
protecting group may also be a polymer resin such as a Wang resin or a 2-chlorotrityl<br>
chloride resin.<br>
[00122]	It will also be appreciated by those skilled in the art, although such protected<br>
derivatives of compounds of formula (I), as described above (e.g., in the Overview and in<br>
Thiazolidinone Compounds and Derivatives), may not possess pharmacological activity as<br>
such, they may be administered to a mammal and thereafter metabolized in the body to form<br>
compounds of the invention which are pharmacologically active. Such derivatives may<br>
therefore be described as "prodrugs". All prodrugs of compounds of formula (I) are included<br>
within the scope of the invention.<br>
[00123]	The following Reaction Schemes illustrate methods to make compounds of the<br>
invention. It is understood that one of ordinary skill in the art would be able to make the<br>
compounds of the invention by similar methods or by methods known to one skilled in the<br>
art. In general, starting components may be obtained from sources such as Aldrich, or<br>
synthesized according to sources known to those of ordinary skill in the art (see, e.g., Smith<br>
and March, March's Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure,<br>
5th edition (Wiley Interscience, New York)). Moreover, the various substituted groups (e.g.,<br><br><br>
X1, X2, X3, Y1, Y2 and Y3, etc.) of the compounds of the invention may be attached to the<br>
starting components, intermediate components, and/or final products according to methods<br>
known to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
[00124]	In the following Reaction Schemes, R represents an alkyl or aralkyl group and W<br>
represents a halogen atom, such as Cl, Br or I.<br>
[00125]	The following Reaction Scheme 1 is directed to the preparation of compounds of<br>
formula (1), which are compounds of the invention as described above (e.g., in the Overview<br>
and in Thiazolidinone Compounds and Derivatives), where A4 is absent, and A1, A2, A3, X1,<br>
X2, X3, Y1, Y2, and Y3 are as described above (e.g., in the Overview and in Thiazolidinone<br>
Compounds and Derivatives).<br>
REACTION SCHEME 1<br><br>
[00126]	In general, compounds of formula (1) are prepared by first treating a compound of<br>
formula (a) with 1 equivalent of abase, such as NaOH, at ambient temperature. Compound<br>
of formula (b), dissolved in an appropriate solvent such as THF, is then added to the reaction<br>
mixture. The resulting reaction mixture is then stirred for a period of time of between about<br>
1 hour to about 24 hours. An acid, such as HC1, is then added to the reaction mixture. The<br>
resulting reaction mixture is then stirred for a period of time of between about 1 hour to<br>
about 24 hours. The compound of formula (c) is then isolated from the reaction mixture by<br>
standard isolation and purification techniques. The compound of formula (c) is then treated<br>
with a compound of formula (d) under standard Knoevenagel condensation conditions to<br>
yield the desired product of formula (1).<br><br><br>
[00127]	Alternatively, compounds of formula (1) can be prepared according to the following<br>
Reaction Scheme 2 wherein A1, A2, A3, Y1, Y2, and Y3 are as described above (e.g., in the<br>
Overview and in Thiazolidinone Compounds and Derivatives), and W is halo:<br>
REACTION SCHEME 2<br><br>
[00128]	In general, the compounds of formula (1) can be prepared by first treating a<br>
compound of formula (e) with a compound of formula (f) under standard Knoevenagel<br>
condensation conditions, such as under reflux in the presence of catalytic amount of<br>
piperidine in glacial acetic acid, an alcohol or another appropriate solvent. The compound of<br>
formula (g) is then isolated from the reaction mixture by standard isolation and purification<br>
techniques. The compound of formula (g) is then treated with a compound of formula (h)<br>
under standard Ullmann condensation conditions, such as in the presence of Cu or Cu2O or<br>
CuO at elevated temperatures, to yield the desired product of formula (1).<br><br>
[00129]	Alternatively, compounds of formula (1) can be prepared according to the following<br>
Reaction Scheme 3 wherein A1, A2, A3, Y1, Y2, and Y3 are as described above (e.g., in the<br>
Overview and in Thiazolidinone Compounds and Derivatives) and W is halo.<br>
REACTION SCHEME 3<br><br>
[00130]	In this reaction scheme, the first step is the Ullmann condensation between the<br>
compound of formula (e) and the compound of formula (h) to produce the compound of<br>
formula (c), which then undergoes Knoevenagel condensation with a compound of formula<br>
(d) to yield the desired product of formula (1).<br>
[00131]	The starting compound of formula (e) can be purchased from different chemical<br>
suppliers or synthesized according to methods known to one skilled in the art, or by the<br>
methods similar to those disclosed in F. C. Brown et. al, J. Am. Chem. Soc, 78, 384-388<br>

(see Fig. 1C) and analogs with different positions of the trifluoromethyl and carboxy<br>
substituents (see, e.g., Fig. 1D) was accomplished by Knoevenagel condensation of 2-<br>
thioxo-3-[a-trifluoromethyl-4-phenyl]-4-thiazolidinone (a=2, 3 or 4) with b-<br>
carboxybenzaldehyde (b=2, 3 or 4) in the presence of piperidine. The precipitate was<br>
filtered, washed with ethanol, dried and recrystallized 2-3 times from ethanol to give bright<br>
yellow crystals (70-85% yields). Structures were confirmed by lH-NMR. Purity was &gt; 99%<br>
as judged by thin layer chromatography and HPLC.<br><br><br>

Synthetic Example<br>
Synthesis of 3-[(3-trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-5-[(4-carboxyphenyl)methylene]-2-<br>
thioxo-4-thiazolidinone<br>
[00135]	A. To a stirred solution of 3-trifluromethylanilne (1.6 g, 10 mmol) and triethylamine<br>
(1 g, 10 mmol) in ethyl acetate (10 mL) was added dropwise carbon disulfide (0.8 g, 10<br>
mmol) during a 30-minute period. A mild exothermic reaction, which began when the<br>
addition was about half complete, was easily controlled by intermittent use of ice bath. After<br>
stirring overnight, the thick yellow slurry was filtered and the precipitate was washed with<br>
50 mL of diethyl ether and air-dried to give 3 g (89 %) of a pale yellow dithiocarbamate<br>
solid, m.p. 92-95°C (dec).<br>
[00136]	B. Sodium chloroacetate (prepared from chloroacetic acid (0.064 g, 0.46 mmol) in<br>
0.6 mL of NaHC03 solution, pH 8-9) was stirred and cooled to 5-10°C and the<br>
dithiocarbamate (0.3 g, 0.9 mmol) was added over a period often minutes. Stirring was<br>
continued while the flask was allowed to warm to ambient temperature. After 2 hours of<br>
stirring, the solution was cooled to 10°C and acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid<br>
and the reaction mixture was heated to 90-95°C for 30 minutes. The resulting precipitate was<br>
filtered, washed with water and recrystallised from ethanol to give 0.103 g of 2-thioxo-3-(3-<br>

above (0.1 g, 0.36 mmol) and 4-carboxybenzaldehyde (0.054 g, 0.36 mmol) in absolute<br>
alcohol (1 mL) and piperidine (1 drop) was stirred at reflux for 30 minutes. The yellow<br>
precipitate was filtered, washed with ethanol, dried and recrystallised from ethanol to yield<br>
0.108 g (73%) of the title compound as yellow crystalline solid, m.p.:180-182°C, 1H NMR<br>
(300 MHz, DMSO-d6): S 7.78 (d, 2H, carboxyphenyl, J= 8.2 Hz ), 7.80-8.00 (m, 5H,<br>

[00139]	The following materials and methods were used in the examples that follow.<br>
Cell lines, Mice and Compounds<br>
[00140]	Fischer rat thyroid (FRT) cells coexpressing human wildtype CFTR and the halide<br>
indicator YPP-H148Q were generated as described previously (Galietta et al. 2001 J. Biol.<br>
Chem. 276:19723-19728). Cells were plated in 96-well black-walled microplates (Corning<br>
Costar) at a density of 20,000 cells per well in Coon's modified F12 medium supplemented<br>
with 5% fetal calf serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL<br>
streptomycin. Assays were done at 48 hours after plating at which time cells were just<br>
confluent (~40,000 cells per well).<br>
[00141]	Initial screening was done using a diverse collection of 50,000 drug-like compounds<br>
from ChemBridge (San Diego, CA) obtained as 10 mM stock solutions in DMSO and<br>
diluted to 100 mM in 96-well microplates. Structure-activity analysis was done on analogs<br>
purchased from ChemBridge and ChemDiv (San Diego, CA).<br><br><br>
[00142]	Wildtype and cystic fibrosis (AF508 homozygous mutant) mice were bred by the CF<br>
Animal Core facility at University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Animal protocols<br>
were approved by the UCSF Committee on Animal Research.<br>
[00143]	T84 and Caco-2 cells were obtained from the UCSF cell culture facility. T84 cells<br>
were cultured in a 1:1 mixture of DMEM and Hams F12 supplemented with 5% fetal calf<br>
serum, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin and plated on Snapwell inserts<br>
(Corning Costar) for growth in a humidified (5% 02 / 95% CO2) atmosphere at 37°C. Cells<br>
were used at 10-14 days after plating. Caco-2 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10<br>
fetal calf serum, 1% nonessential amino acids, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 µg/mL<br>
streptomycin, and cultured on Snapwell inserts. Cells were used at 21-24 days after plating.<br>
Wildtype mice in a CD 1 genetic background were bred as described previously. Male Wistar<br>
rats (200-250 g) were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. Animal protocols were<br>
approved by the UCSF Committee on Animal Research. Fragments of human colon were<br>
obtained freshly at the time of excision surgery and transported in ice-cold saline for use<br>
within 1 hour after excision.<br>
[00144]	Forskolin, 8-bromo cGMP, amiloride, cholera toxin and STa toxin were purchased<br>
from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). CFTRact-16 was from ChemBridge (San Diego,<br>
CA).<br>
Screening Procedures<br>
[00145]	Assays were done using a customized screening system (Beckman) consisting of a 3-<br>
meter robotic arm, CO2 incubator, plate washer, liquid handling workstation, bar code<br>
reader, delidding station, and two FluoStar fluorescence plate readers (BMG<br>
Labtechnologies, Offenburg, Germany), each equipped with two syringe pumps and<br>
HQ500/20X (500 ± 10 ran) excitation and HQ535/30M (535 ± 15 nm) emission filters<br>
(Chroma). The robotic system was integrated using SAMI version 3.3 software (Beckman)<br>
modified for two plate readers. Custom software was written in VBA (Visual Basic for<br>
Applications) to compute baseline-subtracted, normalized fluorescence slopes (giving halide<br>
influx rates) from stored data files.<br>
[00146]	The assay was set-up by loading the incubator (37 °C, 90% humidity, 5% C02) with<br>
40-60 96-well plates containing the FRT cells, and loading a carousel with 96-well plates<br>
containing test compounds and disposable plastic pipette tips. To initiate the assay, each well<br>
of a 96-well plate was washed 3 times in PBS (300 µL/wash), leaving 50 µL PBS. Ten µL of<br>
a CFTR-activating cocktail (5 µM forskolin, 100 µM IBMX, 25 µM apigenin in PBS) was<br>
added, and after 5 min one test compound (0.5 µL of 1 mM DMSO solution) was added to<br><br><br>
each well to give 10 uM final concentration. After 10 min, 96-well plates were transferred to<br>
a plate reader for fluorescence assay. Each well was assayed individually for CFTR-<br>
mediated I" transport by recording fluorescence continuously (200 ms per point) for 2 s<br>
(baseline) and then for 12 s after rapid (
which 137 mM Cl- was replaced by I-.<br>
Assays of Intracellular [cAMP] And Toxicity<br>
[00147]	[cAMP] and phosphatase assays were performed as reported previously (Galietta et<br>
al. 2001 J.Biol. Chem. 276:19723-19728). Cell toxicity was assessed by the<br>
dihydrorhodamine method at 24 hours after cell incubation with 0-1000 uM inhibitor.<br>
Animal toxicity was assessed by measurement of serum chemistries and hematology (UCSF<br>
Clinical Laboratory) in mice at 5 days after daily intraperitoneal injections with 0-100 µg/kg<br>
inhibitor.<br>
MDR-1 Activity<br>
[00148]	MDR-1 activity was evaluated by measuring 3H-vincristine accumulation in an<br>
immortalized human tracheal cell line, 9HTEo-/Dx, in which the endogenous expression of<br>
MDR-1 was upregulated by selection in increasing concentrations of doxorubicin (Rasola et<br>
al. 1994 J. Biol. Chem. 269:1432-1436). Cells were seeded in 24-well microplates (200,000<br>
cells/well). After 48 hours, cells were washed with a solution containing (in mM): 130 NaCl,<br>
2 KC1,1 KH2P04,2 CaCl2,2 MgCl2,10 Na-Hepes (pH 7.3) and 10 glucose, and incubated<br>
for 1 hour at 37 °C with 200 uL of the same solution containing 3H-vincristine (0.7 µM; 1<br>
µCi/mL). Cells were then washed three times with ice-cold solution and lysed in 0.25 M<br>
NaOH. Vincristine content was determined by scintillation counting.<br>
Short-circuit Current Tests Using CFTR-Expressing FRT Cells<br>
[00149]	Snapwell inserts containing CFTR-expressing FRT cells or human bronchial<br>
epithelial cells were mounted in an Ussing chamber system. For FRT cells the<br>
hemichambers were filled with 5 mL of 75 mM NaCl and 75 mM Na gluconate (apical) and<br>
150 mM NaCl (basolateral) (pH 7.3), and the basolateral membrane was permeabilized with<br>
250 g/mL amphotericin B (Galietta etal 2001 J. Biol. Chem. 276:19723-19728). For<br>
bronchial epithelial cells and T84 cells, both hemichambers contained a Krebs bicarbonate<br>
solution. Hemichambers were continuously bubbled with air (FRT cells) or 5% CO2 in air<br>
(bronchial and T84 cells) and maintained at 37°C. Short-circuit current was recorded<br>
continuously using a DVC-1000 voltage clamp (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota,<br>
Florida) using Ag/AgCl electrodes and 1 M KC1 agar bridges.<br><br><br>
Patch-Clamp Analysis of Cl- Channel Activity<br>
[00150]	Membrane current was measured in a whole-cell configuration. For recordings of Cl-<br>
channels, the extracellular (bath) solution contained (in mM): 150 NaCl, 1 CaCl2,1 MgCl2,<br>
10 glucose, 10 mannitol, 10 TES (pH 7.4), and the intracellular (pipette) solution contained:<br>
120 CsCl, 1 MgCl2,10 TEA-C1,0.5 EGTA, 1 Mg-ATP, 10 Hepes (pH 7.3). CFTR was<br>
activated by forskolin (5 uM) in the extracellular solution. The time-course of membrane<br>
conductance was monitored in response to alternating voltage pulses of-100 and +80 mV.<br>
At defined times the protocol was interrupted to generate current-voltage relationships<br>
(voltage pulses from -100 to +100 mV in 20 mV increments). Volume-sensitive Cl- channels<br>
were activated by a hypotonic solution (extracellular NaCl decreased to 120 NaCl; 250<br>
mosM/kg). Calcium-sensitive Cl- channels were activated in human bronchial epithelial cells<br>
by addition of 100 M UTP to the extracellular solution.<br>
Patch-Clamp Analysis of ATP-Sensitive K* Channels<br>
[00151]	Membrane potential was recorded in the pancreatic  cell line INS-1 in which the<br>
extracellular (bath) solution contained (in mM): 130 NaCl, 2 KC1,1 KH2P04,2 CaCl2,2<br>
MgCl2,10 Na-Hepes (pH 7.3) and 10 glucose. The pipette contained (in mM): 140 KC1,1<br>
CaCl2,2 mM MgCl2,10 EGTA, 0.5 MgATP, 10 K-Hepes (pH 7.3). After achieving the<br>
whole-cell configuration, the amplifier was switched to current-clamp mode.<br>
Intestinal Fluid Secretion And Short-circuit Current<br>
[00152]	In the first of 3 assays, fluid accumulation in ileal loops was measured (Oi et ah 2002<br>
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 99:3042-3046; Gorbach et ah 1971 J. Clin. Invest. 50:881-889).<br>
Mice (age 8-10 weeks, body weight 25-35 g) in a CD1 genetic background (or AF508<br>
homozygous mice) were starved for 24 hrs and anaesthetized with intraperitoneal ketamine<br>
(40 mg/kg) and xylazine (8 mg/kg). Body temperature was maintained during surgery at 36-<br>
38°C using a heating pad. A small abdominal incision was made to expose the small<br>
intestine and closed ileal loops (length 20-30 mm) proximal to the cecum were isolated by<br>
sutures. Loops were injected with 100 uL of PBS alone or PBS containing cholera toxin (1<br>
g). In some experiments the inhibitor (150 g/kg) was administered by intraperitoneal<br>
injection. The abdominal incision was closed with suture and mice were allowed to recover<br>
from anesthesia. At 6 hours the mice were anesthestized, intestinal loops were exteriorized,<br>
and loop length and weight were measured after removal of mesentery and connective tissue.<br>
[00153]	In the sealed adult mouse model of secretory diarrhea mice were gavaged with<br>
cholera toxin (10 ug) in 0.1 mL of 7% bicarbonate buffer (or buffer alone) using a orogastric<br>
feeding needle (Richardson et ah 1986 Infect. Immun. 54:522-528; Gabriel et ah 1999 Am J.<br><br><br>
Physiol. 276:G58-G63).Four experimental groups were: control (buffer alone), cholera-<br>
treated, cholera-treated + inhibitor (150 µg/kg intraperitoneal 2 min before gavage), and<br>
inhibitor alone. After six hours mice were euthanized and the small intestine (from pylorus<br>
to cecum) was exteriorized and stripped of associated mesenteric and connective tissues. The<br>
intestine was weighed, then opened longitudinally to remove lumenal fluid (by blotting), and<br>
weighed again. Fluid accumulation was computed from the ratio in intestinal weight before<br>
and after lumenal fluid removal. For measurement of short-circuit current, strips of rat colon<br>
were isolated, stripped of muscle layers by blunt dissection, mounted in Ussing chambers<br>
(area 0.7 cm2), and bathed in oxygenated bicarbonate Ringers solution containing 10 µM<br>
indomethacin. Short-circuit current was measured after inhibition of Na+ current by<br>
amiloride (10 µM), followed by stimulation by forskolin (20 µM) and subsequent inhibitor<br>
addition.<br>
Synthesis of 14C-labeled CFTRinh-172 (Fig. 6)<br>
[00154]	The intermediate 2-thioxo-3-(3-trifluoromethyl phenyl)-4-thiazolidinone was<br>
synthesized by dropwise addition of carbon disulfide (0.8 g, 10 mM) to a stirred solution of<br>
3-trifluromethylaniline (1.6 g, 10 mM) and triethylamine (1 g, 10 mM) in ethyl acetate (10<br>
mL) over 30 minutes. An ice bath was used to prevent excessive heating during reaction.<br>
After stirring overnight, the thick yellow slurry was filtered and the precipitate was washed<br>
with 50 mL of ether and air dried to give 3 g (89 % yield) of a pale yellow dithiocarbamate<br>
solid (melting point 92-95°C). Na Br-14C-acetate (prepared from Br-14C-acetic acid<br>
(Amersham), 55 mCi/mmol, 64 mg, 0.46 mM in 0.6 mL of water, pH 8-9 using NaHC03)<br>
was stirred and cooled to 5-10°C and dithiocarbamate (0.3 g, 0.9 mM) was added over 10<br>
minutes. Stirring was continued while the flask was allowed to warm to ambient<br>
temperature. After 2 hours, the solution was cooled to 10°C, acidified with concentrated<br>
HC1, and heated to 90-95°C for 30 minutes. The resultant precipitate was filtered, washed<br>
with water and recrystallized from ethanol to give 103 mg of the desired product as shiny<br>
crystals (83% yield), m.p. 177-178°C; specific activity (14C) 55 mCi/mmol; 1H NMR (300<br>
MHz, CDC13):  4.18 (s, 2H, CH2), 7.40 (d, 1H, phenyl, J= 8.0 Hz), 7.48 (s, 1H, phenyl),<br>
7.64 (t, 1H, phenyl, J= 8.0 Hz), 7.72 (d, 1H, phenyl, J= 7.6 Hz) ppm.<br>
[00155]	For synthesis of 2-thioxo-3-(3-trifluoromethylpbenyl)-5-[4-<br>
carboxyphenyhnethylene]-4- thiazolidinone (14C-5) (14C-CFTRinh-172), a mixture of 2-<br>
thioxo-3-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)-4- thiazolidinone (14C-5) (100 mg, 0.36 mM) and 4-<br>
carboxybenzaldehyde (54 mg, 0.36 mM) in absolute alcohol (1 mL) and piperidine (1 drop)<br>
was refluxed for 30 minutes. The yellow precipitate was filtered, washed with ethanol, dried<br><br><br>
and recrystallized from ethanol to give 108 mg (73% yield) yellow crystals, m.p. 180-182°C;<br>
specific activity (14C) 54 mCi/mmol; 1H NMR (300 MHz, DMSO-dg):  7.78 (d, 2H,<br>
carboxyphenyl, J= 8.2 Hz), 7.80-8.00 (m, 5H, trifluoromethylphenyl and CH), 8.07 (d, 2H,<br>
carboxyphenyl, J= 8.31 Hz), 13.20 (s, 1H, COOH, D20 exchange) ppm. Purification to<br>
&gt;99.9% was accomplished by repeated recrystallization.<br>
Pharmacokinetic studies<br>
[00156]	A bolus of 14C-CFTRinh-172 (50 uCi) in PBS containing 3% DMSO (titrated to pH<br>
7.4 using NaOH) was administered intravenously in rats over 1 min (male Sprague-Dawley<br>
rats, 360-420 grams) by an indwelling jugular catheter. Blood was collected from the<br>
catheter at specified times. 14C-Radioactivity was determined in plasma (isolated by<br>
centrifugation of whole blood at 14,000 g for 10 min) by scintillation counting (Scintiverse<br>
SE, Fisher, CA) using a LS-6500 Multi-Purpose Scintillation Counter (Beckman).<br>
Pharmacokinetic analysis was done using WinNonLin software (Pharsight). Rats were<br>
sacrificed by pentabarbital overdose after collection of the final blood/tissue samples. All<br>
animal procedures were approved by the UCSF Committee on Animal Research.<br>
Tissue distribution and elimination studies<br>
[00157]	A bolus of 14C-CFTRinh-172 (2 Ci) was administered intravenously over 1 min in<br>
mice (male CD1 mice, 30-35 grams) by tail vein. Mice were sacrificed at 5,30, 120 and 240<br>
min. Organs were removed, weighed and homogenized in distilled water (10-50 vol %).<br>
Radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting of the homogenates (25-50 L) and<br>
expressed as total 14C-radioactivity per organ (or per gram tissue for skeletal muscle). At the<br>
same time blood, urine and bile (from gallbladder or duodenum) were collected and 14C-<br>
radioactivity was measured and expressed per mL of fluid. Elimination studies were done by<br>
collections of urine and stool over the first 24 hr after 14C-CFTRinh-172 administration.<br>
Tissue distribution studies were also done on rats prepared as for pharmacokinetic studies.<br>
Analysis of inhibitor metabolism<br>
[00158]	Aliquots of bodily fluids (plasma, urine, bile) and liver homogenate were spotted<br>
onto Silica plates and resolved by thin layer chromatography using a ethyl acetate: hexane:<br>
methanol (1:1:0.1) solvent system which gave rf ~ 0.5 for the original inhibitor.<br>
Autoradiography was performed using Hyperfilm (Amersham) with a Transcreen LE<br>
amplification system (Kodak). 14C-labeled CFTRinh-172 standards were included on all<br>
plates.<br><br><br>
Short-circuit current measurements (Examples 7)<br>
[00159]	For cell studies, Snapwell inserts containing T84 cell monolayers were mounted in an<br>
Ussing chamber system (Navicyte, Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA). Hemichambers were<br>
filled with Krebs-bicarbonate solution containing (in mM) NaCl 120, NaHC03 25, KH2P04<br>
3.3, K2HP04 0.8, MgCl2 1.2, CaCl2 1.2, glucose 10 (maintained at 37°C) and continuously<br>
bubbled with 5% C02 / 95% 02. High K+ buffer contained (in mM) NaCl 65, KC167.5,<br>
KH2PO4 1.5, CaCl2 1, MgCl2 0.5, HEPES 10, glucose 10. Low CI'buffer contained (inmM)<br>
Na-gluconate 120, KH2P04 3.3, K2HP04 0.8, MgCl2 1.2, Cacl2 1.2, HEPES 10, glucose 10<br>
(maintained at 37 °C) and continuously bubbled with air. For measurements in mouse colon,<br>
mice were anaesthetized with intraperinoneal ketamine (40 mg/kg) and xylazine (8 mg/kg).<br>
. The ileum was removed, washed with ice-cold Krebs buffer, opened along the mesenteric<br>
border, and mounted in a micro-Ussing chamber (area 0.7 cm2, World Precision Instruments,<br>
Sarasota, FL). For measurements in human intestine, colonic fragments were stripped of<br>
muscle layers by blunt dissection and mounted as described above. Hemichambers were<br>
filled with oxygenated Ringersbicarbonate solution containing 10M indomethacin. Short-<br>
circuit current was recorded using a DVC-1000 voltage-clamp (World Precision<br>
Instruments) with Ag/AgCl electrodes and 1 M KC1 agar bridges. Agonists/inhibitors were<br>
added to hemichambers as described below.<br>
In vivo intestinal fluid secretion in mouse and rat models (Examples 5 and 7).<br>
[00160]	Mice (age 8-10 weeks, body weight 25- 35 g) in a CD1 genetic background were<br>
given access to water but not food for 24 hr. Mice were anaesthetized as described above and<br>
body temperature was maintained during surgery at 36-38°C using a heating pad. A small<br>
abdominal incision was made to expose the small intestine and closed ileal loops (length 20-<br>
30 mm) proximal to the cecum were isolated by sutures. Loops were injected with 100 L of<br>
PBS alone or PBS containing cholera toxin (1 ug). In some experiments CFTRinh-172 (0-200<br>
g) was administered by intraperitoneal injection at specified times before or after cholera<br>
toxin injection. The abdominal incision was closed with suture and mice were allowed to<br>
recover from anesthesia. At 6 hours the mice were anesthetized, intestinal loops were<br>
exteriorized, and loop length and weight were measured after removal of mesentery and<br>
connective tissue.<br>
[00161]	For measurement of enterotoxin-induced fluid secretion in a rat closed-loop model,<br>
male Wistar rats (body weight 200-250 g) were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (45<br>
mg/kg). Loops (40-60 mm) were isolated and injected with 300 uL PBS alone or PBS<br>
containing cholera toxin (10 ug) or STa toxin (0.1 g). In some experiments CFTRinh-172<br><br><br>
(200 g) was given by intraperitoneal injection after cholera toxin or STa toxin<br>
administration. Loop length and weight were measured at 3 hr (STa) or 6 hr (cholera toxin).<br>
[00162]	In studies of orally administered CFTRinh-172, an open-loop mouse model was used<br>
in which mice were gavaged with 7% bicarbonate buffer or cholera toxin (1 g in 7%<br>
bicarbonate buffer) alone and with CFTRinh-172 (200 ug in vitamin E TPGS, see below)<br>
using an orogastric feeding needle. After 6 hours the small intestine (from pylorus to cecum)<br>
was exteriorized and stripped of associated mesenteric and connective tissue. The intestine<br>
was weighed, opened longitudinally to remove lumenal fluid, and reweighed to quantify<br>
fluid accumulation.<br>
Caco-2 permeability assay.<br>
[00163]	Caco-2 cells were cultured on porous inserts to give monolayer resistances of 400-<br>
600 Qcm-1. For transport studies culture medium was replaced with an equal volume of<br>
Hank's buffered salt solution (HBSS) containing 15 mM glucose and 25 mM HEPES (pH<br>
7.3). After 1 hr CFTRinh-172 (25 M) was added to the upper chamber and plates were<br>
gently rocked at 37°C. At specified times 50 uL of solution from the lower (receiving)<br>
chamber were removed for measurement of CFTRinh-172 concentration by UV absorbance<br>
(385 mn). Apparent permeability (Papp) was calculated from: Papp = dC/dT X (Vr/ACO),<br>
where dC/dT is the rate of increase in CFTRinh-172 concentration in the receiver chamber,<br>
VT is the volume of the receiver chamber, A is monolayer surface area, and CO is initial<br>
CFTRinh-172 concentration in the donor chamber.<br>
Pharmacokinetic and oral bioavailability studies.<br>
[00164]	Mice were anesthetized briefly using halothane and gavaged orally with 14C-labeled<br>
CFTRinh-172 (12 Ci) solubilized with vitamin E TPGS (d-a-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol<br>
1000 succinate, 0.5% w/v) CFTRinh-172 in 10% w/v suspension of TPGS in water). For<br>
comparison other mice were given l4C-CFTRinh-172 (2 uCi) intravenously by tail vein<br>
infusion. Blood was collected from the tail vein at specified times for measurement of<br>
plasma C radioactivity. At 6 hours mice were killed by pentobarbital overdose and organs<br>
were removed for measurement of radioactivity in homogenates.<br>
Biological Example 1<br>
Screening of CFTR Inhibitors<br>
[00165]	The primary screening technique used to identify the compounds of the invention<br>
was designed to identify inhibitors of CFTR Cl- conductance by direct CFTR-inhibitor<br>
interaction. CFTR was pre-stimulated in CFTR-expressing FRT cells by an activating<br><br><br>
cocktail containing forskolin, IBMX and apigenin, as shown schematically in FIG. 1 A. The<br>
activation of CFTR by multiple mechanisms (cAMP elevation, phosphodiesterase inhibition,<br>
and direct CFTR binding) allowed identification of inhibitors that blocked the CFTR Cl-<br>
transporting pathway directly rather than more proximal step(s) in a signaling pathway. The<br>
FRT cells co-expressed a yellow fluorescent protein-based Cl- /I sensor that provided a<br>
quantitative fluorescence read-out of inhibition potency (See, e.g., Jayaraman et al, 2000, J.<br>
Biol. Chem. 275:6047-6050; Galietta et al., 2001, Am. J. Physiol. 281:C1734-C1742.). After<br>
CFTR pre-stimulation and compound addition, cells were subjected to an inwardly-directed<br>
I gradient to drive T influx and produce decreasing fluorescence. Each assay consisted of<br>
recording baseline fluorescence for 2 seconds, followed by 12 seconds of continuous<br>
recording of fluorescence after rapid addition of the T containing solution. Compounds were<br>
tested separately at 10 M concentration in a 96-well format utilizing a fully-automated<br>
high-throughput screening apparatus (see Example 2 below).<br>
[00166]	FIG. 1B graphically illustrates representative curves, as relative YFP fluorescence<br>
versus time, from the primary screen of 50,000 compounds using the assay of FIG. 1 A. As<br>
quantified from the slope of the decreasing fluorescence after I addition, 49,993 compounds<br>
had no significant effect on the kinetics of I influx (
compounds produced a small decrease in negative slope (10-52 %), nearly all of which had a<br>
similar core structure consisting of a 2-thioxo-4-thiazolidinone heterocycle with substituted<br>
phenyhnethylene and phenyl moieties (Fig. 1C). More than 250 analogs having<br>
thiazolidinone core structure were subsequently screened to identify the most potent CFTR<br>
inhibitors.<br>
[00167]	FIG. 1D shows the most effective thiazolidinone CFTR inhibitors identified in the<br>
screening were 3-[(3-trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-5-[(4-carboxyphenyl)methylene]-2-thioxo-4-<br>
thiazolidinone (referred to herein as CFTRIinh-172), along with five analogs having<br>
significant inhibitory potencies. Thus the following compounds were identified as CFTR<br>
inhibitors: 3-[(3-trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-5-[(4-carboxyphenyl)methylene]-2-thioxo-4-<br>
thiazofidmone(CFTRinh-172);3-[(3-trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-5-[(4-nitrophenyl)methylene]-<br>
2-thioxo-4-thiazolidinone(CFTRinh-020);3-[(3-trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-5-[(4-<br>
oxycarboxyphenyl)methylene]-2-thioxo-4-thiazolidinone(CFTRinh-029); 3-[(3-<br>
trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-5-[(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)methylene]-2-thioxo-4-thiazolidinone<br>
(CFTRinh-l 85), 3-[(3-trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-5-[(3,5-dibromo-4-<br>
hydroxyphenyl)methylene]-2-thioxo-4-thiazolidinone (CFTRinh-214) and 3-[(3-<br>
trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-5-[(3-bromo-4-hydroxy-5-nitrophenyl)methylene]-2-thioxo-4-<br><br><br>
thiazolidinone (CFTRinh-236). The most effective CFTR inhibitors included one or more<br>
electron-withdrawing groups, such as a 3-trifluoromethyl group, on ring 1, and electron-<br>
withdrawing group or polar substituents on ring 2 as discussed above. CFTRinh-172 was<br>
selected for further analysis. The relative potencies were: 0.2 (CFTRinh-020), 0.3 (CFTRinh-<br>
029), 1.0 (CFTRinh-172), 0.2 (CFTRinh-185), 0.1 (CFTRinh-214), and 0.1 (CFTRinh236).<br>
[00168]	To examine the effect of ring position of the trifluoromethyl and carboxyl<br>
substituents, 8 analogs of CFTRinh-172 were synthesized in which the substituents were<br>
moved to each unique position on rings 1 (trifluoromethyl) and 2 (carboxy). Compared to<br>
CFTRinh-172 (potency 1.0), the relative inhibitory potencies of the 3-[(a-<br>
trifluoromemyl)phenyl]-5-[(b-carboxyphenyl)m<br>
were: 0.69 (a=2, b=2), 0.70 (2,3), 0.66 (2,4), 0.74 (3,2), 0.90 (3,3), 0.67 (4,2), 0.64 (4,3)<br>
and 0.56 (4,4).<br>
Biological Example 2<br>
Characterization of CFTRinh-172<br>
[00169]	The level of CFTR inhibition for specific dosages of the subj ect thiazolidinone<br>
compounds was determined using the fluorescence assay shown in FIG. 1A and described<br>
above. FIG. 2A shows dose-inhibition data for CFTRinh-172 as relative YFP fluorescence<br>
versus time. Significant CFTR inhibition was seen at 0.3-0.6 M concentrations of this<br>
thiazolidinone compound. FIG. 2B shows that inhibition by CFTRjnh-172 (shown graphically<br>
as relative transport rate versus time after addition or washout) was complete in -10 min (tm<br>
4 min) and was reversed after washout with im ~5 min {inset). The relative transport rates<br>
illustrated in FIG. 2C show that CFTRinh-172 effectively inhibited CFTR activation by<br>
multiple types of agonists that were not included in the activating cocktail used for initial<br>
screening. These agonists included genistein, CPT-cAMP, CPX, 8-MPO and the potent<br>
benzofiavone CFTR activator UCCF-029 (2-(4-pyridinium)benzo[h]4H-chromen-4-one<br>
bisulfate) and the benzimidazolone CFTR activator UCCF-853 (see Galietta, et al, 2001, J.<br>
Biol Chem. 276:19723-19728).<br>
[00170]	Electrophysiology experiments were also carried out to establish the inhibitory<br>
potency and specificity of CFTRinh-172. Fig. 3 A shows the rapid, dose-dependent inhibition<br>
of short-circuit current in CFTR-expressing FRT cells with CFTRinh-172 added to the<br>
solution bathing the apical cell surface. Fig. 3B shows the average dose-inhibition<br>
relationships of CFTRinh-172 (Kd ~ 300 nM, Hill coefficient ~ 1) and glibenclamide (Kd ~<br>
200 M) tested under identical conditions.<br><br><br>
[00171]	Similar inhibitory potencies for this thiazolidinone were found in cells that natively<br>
express wildtype CFTR, including T84 cells and primary cultures of human bronchial<br>
epithelial cells, as well as in transfected FRT cells expressing G551D-CFTR and F508-<br>
CFTR (after low temperature correction). For studies in bronchial cells, the Na+ channel was<br>
blocked with amiloride so that baseline current is largely CFTR-dependent. After maximal<br>
CFTR activation by a CPT-cAMP, application of CFTRinh-172 from the apical side inhibited<br>
short-circuit current strongly (Fig. 3C, left). CFTRinh-172 also inhibited short-circuit current<br>
when added from the basolateral side (Fig. 3C, right).<br>
[00172]	Whole-cell membrane currents were measured in CFTR-expressing FRT cells as<br>
shown in FIG. 3D. Stimulation by 5 uM forskolin produced a membrane current of 381±47<br>
pA/pF (n=4) at +100 mV (total membrane capacitance 21+3 pF). The current-voltage<br>
relationship was linear as expected for a pure CFTR current (Fig. 3F). Extracellular<br>
perfusion with 2 M CFTRinh-172 produced a rapid reduction in current at all membrane<br>
potentials, suggesting voltage-independent CFTR inhibition. The lack of voltage-dependence<br>
of channel block was confirmed using a lower concentration of CFTRinh-l 72 (0.2 uM) to<br>
obtain -50 % inhibition (Fig., 3F).<br>
[00173]	The specificity of CFTRinh-172 for inhibition of CFTR was also examined. Two non-<br>
CFTR Cl- channels were studied. CFTRinh-172 at 5 M concentration did not inhibit Ca2+<br>
activated Cl- secretion produced by addition of UTP (100 M) to the apical bathing solution<br>
in polarized human bronchial epithelial cells (Fig. 4A). Maximal UTP-dependent short-<br>
circuit currents were 9.9+0.5 uA/cm2 and 10.0+0.2 A/cm2 in the absence and presence of<br>
CFTRinh-172, respectively (SE, n=4). CFTRinh-172 at 5 M also did not block volume-<br>
activated CY currents elicited in FRT cells by extracellular perfusion with a 250 mosM/kg<br>
hypotonic solution (Fig. 4B).<br>
[00174]	The activity of a CFTR homolog, the ATP-bmding cassette transporter MDR-1<br>
(multi-drug resistance protein-1), was measured in 9HTEo-/Dx which overexpress MDR-1<br>
(Rasola et al 1994 J. Biol. Chem. 269:1432-1436). Vincristine accumulation, which is<br>
inversely related to active drug extrusion by MDR-1, was strongly increased by the MDR-1<br>
inhibitor verapamil (100 uM) (Fig. 4C). CFTRinh-172 (5 uM) did not affect vincristine<br>
accumulation and thus did not inhibit MDR-1.<br>
[00175]	Another homolog of CFTR is the sulphonylurea receptor (SUR) which regulates the<br>
activity of ATP-sensitive K+ channels (K-ATP channel) (Aguilar-Bryan and Bryan 1999<br>
Endocr. Rev. 20:101-135). SUR1 is expressed in pancreatic -cells where it controls<br>
membrane potential and insulin release. Sulphonylureas, like glibenclamide, cause insulin<br><br><br>
release (and a hypoglycemic response) by blocking K-ATP channels and membrane<br>
depolarization. To determine whether CFTRmh-172 also blocks K-ATP channels, membrane<br>
potential in a rat pancreatic  cell line, IN S-1, was measured (Fig. 4D, Fig. 4E). In contrast<br>
to large membrane depolarization caused by glibenclamide, CFTRinh-172 (2 and 5 M) did<br>
not depolarize membrane potential. CFTRinh-172 at 5 M caused a small hyperpolarization<br>
that was much less than that caused by the K-ATP channel activator diazoxide (100 uM).<br>
Additional studies indicated that CFTRmh-172 at 5 uM did not block a water channel<br>
(AQP1), urea transporter (UT-B), Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE3) and C17HC03" exchanger<br>
(AE1).<br>
[00176]	Further analysis showed that 5 uM CFTRinh-172 did not affect cellular cAMP<br>
production or phosphatase activity. In FRT cells, basal cAMP content was 225±22<br>
fmol/well, which increased at 30 min after stimulation by 20 uM forskolin to 1290±190<br>
finol/well (no inhibitor) and 1140±50 (+CFTRinh-172) (n=3). As judged using the<br>
dmydrorhodamine assay, CFTRinh-172 was non-toxic to FRT cells after 24 hours at<br>
concentrations up to 100 uM. In mice, intraperitoneal injection of 1000 g/kg CFTRinh-172<br>
daily for 7 days did not cause overt toxicity. Food and water intake were not diminished,<br>
and serum electrolyte concentrations, glucose, liver function indices, serum creatinine,<br>
amylase and hematocrit were not changed. In addition, a single very large systemic dose of<br>
CFTRinh-172 (10 mg/kg) did not cause overt toxicity.<br>
Biological Example 3<br>
In Vivo Efficacy<br>
[00177]	The efficacy of CFTRinh-172 was tested in vivo using two assays of cholera toxin-<br>
induced intestinal fluid secretion, and in isolated intestine by short-circuit analysis. In the<br>
first assay, aseries of closed loops of small intestine were created in vivo and the lumens of<br>
alternate loops were injected with small volumes of saline or saline containing cholera toxin.<br>
Luminal fluid accumulation was determined after 6 hours. As seen visually in FIG. 5 A, there<br>
was marked fluid accumulation and distention in cholera toxin-treated loops, whereas<br>
adjacent control (saline) loops remained empty. A single administration of CFTRinh-172 (150<br>
g/kg intraperitoneal) prior to cholera toxin infusion effectively prevented fluid<br>
accumulation in the toxin-treated intestinal loops.<br>
[00178]	Data from a series of these experiments is summarized graphically in FIG 5B.<br>
CFTRmh-172 significantly reduced fluid secretion to that in saline control loops where an<br>
inactive thiazolidinone analog did not inhibit fluid secretion. As suggested from previous<br><br><br>
data (Gabriel et al. 1994 Science 266:107-109), cholera toxin-treated loops of intestine from<br>
homozygous AF508-CFTR mice also remained empty, indicating the involvement of CFTR<br>
in intestinal fluid secretion. In the second assay, intestinal fluid secretion was induced by<br>
oral administration of cholera toxin (10 g) and CFTRinh-172 was administered systemically.<br>
After six hours there was marked accumulation of fluid as measured by weighing the entire<br>
small intestine. CFTRinh-172 administration remarkably reduced intestinal fluid<br>
accumulation as seen visually and quantified by the ratio of intestinal weight before vs. after<br>
luminal fluid removal (FIG. 5C).<br>
[00179]	Fig. 5D shows CFTRinh-172 inhibition of short-circuit current across intact rat<br>
colonic mucosa. After inhibition of Na+ current by amiloride, forskolin produced a prompt<br>
increase in short-circuit current. CFTRinh-172 added to the mucosal solution inhibited short-<br>
circuit current with greater efficacy than when added to the serosal solution, which may be<br>
related to impaired access to colonic epithelial cells through the residual submucosal tissue.<br>
Addition of 5 M CFTRinh-172 to the mucosal solution alone reduced short-circuit current<br>
by &gt; 80%. These results provide electrophysiological evidence for CFTR Cl- channel<br>
inhibition by CFTRinh-172 in intestine.<br>
Biological Example 4<br>
Pharmacokinetic analysis<br>
[00180]	Pharmacokinetic analysis in rats was done by serial measurements of serum 14C<br>
radioactivity after a single intravenous bolus infusion of 14C-labeled CFTRinh-172. The total<br>
amount of inhibitor infused (400 g, ~1 mg/kg) was effective as an antidiarrheal in rats. Fig.<br>
7 shows that the kinetics of serum 14C radioactivity fitted well to a 2-compartment model<br>
with distribution volume 1.2 L and AUC (area under curve) of 3.8 g-hr/mL. The half-lives<br>
were 0.14 hr (redistribution) and 10.3 hr (elimination). No 14C-labeled CFTRinh-172 was<br>
detected in plasma at 72 hr after administration or in liver or kidney homogenates at 14 days<br>
after administration.<br>
[00181]	The tissue distribution of 14C-labeled CFTRinh-l72 was determined from the<br>
radioactivity of organ homogenates and bodily fluids following a single intravenous bolus<br>
infusion. Fig. 8, panel A summarizes 14C distributions in the major organs at indicated times<br>
after CFTRinh-172 infusion in mice. 14C radioactivity was observed within 5 min primarily in<br>
liver and kidney, decreasing over time. Little radioactivity was found in brain, heart, skeletal<br>
muscle or testes. At later times (30-240 min) 14C radioactivity accumulated in the intestine.<br>
Fig. 3, panel B shows a similar organ distribution of 14C radioactivity in rats measured at 60<br><br><br>
min after intravenous bolus infusion, with little radioactivity in brain, heart and skeletal<br>
muscle. In some experiments, rats were sacrificed at 10 days after infusion of 14C-labeled<br>
CFTRinh-172 (50 Ci).<br>
[00182]	To determine the mechanism of CFTRinh-172 accumulation in kidney, liver and<br>
intestine, 14C radioactivity was measured in serum, urine and bile. Average urine<br>
radioactivity was 4.2 ± 1.2 x 105 cpm/mL in mice over the first 2 hours after infusion. The<br>
ratios of 14C radioactivity in urine-to-blood were in the range 5-7:1, comparable to the ratio<br>
of urine-to-serum osmolalities of ~5:1 (1550 mOsm vs. 310 mOsm), suggesting that<br>
CFTRinh-172 is cleared by the kidney by glomerular filtration without renal tubular<br>
absorption or secretion. A renal clearance mechanism for CFTRinh-172 clearance was<br>
supported by the approximately parallel kinetics of decreasing 14C radioactivity in serum,<br>
urine and kidney tissue (data not shown). The possibility of CFTRinn-172 accumulation in<br>
bile was investigated based on the observation of prompt accumulation of I4C-radioactivity<br>
in liver and late accumulation in intestine. 14C radioactivity was ~9-fold concentrated in bile<br>
vs. blood at 60 min after administration in mice. To determine whether the biliary CFTRinh-<br>
172 was excreted in the stool or returned to the circulation, urine and stool collections were<br>
done on mice over the first 24 hr after radiolabeled inhibitor infusion. 93 ± 3 % of excreted<br>
radioactivity was found in the urine, supporting a primary renal excretion mechanism with<br>
enterohepatic circulation.<br>
[00183]	To determine whether the 14C radioactivity measured in organs and fluids<br>
corresponds to intact or chemically-modified CFTRinh-172, thin layer chromatography and<br>
autoradiography were done on specimens of urine, serum and bile, as well as supernatants of<br>
liver homogenates prepared by centrifugation. Fig. 9 shows a single spot at rf~0.5 for the<br>
original CFTRinh-172 introduced in the bolus infusion. Autoradiography of fluid and organ<br>
homogenates showed single spots at identical rf, indicating that chemical modification of<br>
CFTRinh-172 did not occur.<br>
[00184]	CFTRinh-172 is a weak acid with apKa of 5.5 as determined by spectrophotometric<br>
pH titration. At physiological pH ~1 % of CFTRinh-172 is present as the unionized acid<br>
having low polarity and high membrane permeability. The rapid uptake of CFTRinh-172 in<br>
cell models described above suggests the feasibility of orally bioavailable preparations with<br>
the caveat that protection from the low gastric pH may be needed to avoid precipitation. The<br>
results from these pharmokinetic studies indicate that CFTRinh-172 is slowly eliminated in<br>
rodents by renal clearance without chemical modification, and that CFTRinh-172 is<br>
concentrated in bile and accumulated in intestine. CFTRinh-172 did not significantly cross the<br><br><br>
blood-brain barrier and little CFTRi„h-172 accumulation was found in other vital organs<br>
including heart, lung, skeletal muscle and testes. The slow renal clearance, intestinal<br>
accumulation, and little blood-brain barrier penetration of CFTRinh-172 are favorable for<br>
antidiarrheal applications.<br>
Biological Example 5<br>
Dose-Response and Duration of Inhibitory Effect of CFTRinh-172<br>
[00185]	The purpose of this example was to extend the observations above relating to the<br>
ability of a single intraperitoneal injection of CFTRinh-172 to inhibit cholera toxin-stimulated<br>
fluid secretion in a closed intestinal loop model in mice. Specifically, the goal of this<br>
example was to measure the dose-response relation and the apparent halftime for persistence<br>
of the CFTRinh-172 inhibitory effect.<br>
[00186]	First, the kinetics of intestinal loop fluid absorption and secretion were determined to<br>
characterize the mouse model. To study absorption, loop fluid content was measured at<br>
specified times after injection of 200 uL of PBS into individual loops. Fig. 10, panel A<br>
shows rapid fluid absorption with 50% fluid remaining at ~25 min. Intraperitoneal<br>
administration of CFTRinh-172 at a dose that strongly inhibited cholera toxin-induced<br>
intestinal fluid secretion (20 ug) did not alter the rate of fluid absorption (measured at 30<br>
min) compared to controls (Fig 10, panel A, inset). To study secretion, intestinal loops were<br>
injected with cholera toxin (1 ug in 0.1 mL PBS). Fig. 10, panel B shows a slow onset of<br>
fluid secretion over 6 hr, in agreement with previous studies in rodent models (Gorbach et al.<br>
J. Clin. Invest. 1971 50-881-889; Oi et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2002 99:3042-3046).<br>
The rapid absorption of fluid in the intestine under normal conditions suggests that fluid<br>
accumulated in the intestinal lumen after active secretion may be absorbed rapidly if<br>
secretion is blocked, predicting that CFTR inhibition could be effective in preventing fluid<br>
accumulation even when administered after cholera toxin.<br>
[00187]	Fig. 11, panel A summarizes the results of a CFTRinh-172 dose-response study in<br>
mice in which a single dose of inhibitor was administered by intraperitoneal injection just<br>
after infusion of cholera toxin into closed intestinal loops. Basal intestinal fluid content<br>
(dashed line) was near zero as measured in non-cholera toxin injected loops. CFTRinh-172<br>
inhibited fluid accumulation in cholera toxin-injected intestinal loops by ~90%, with 50%<br>
inhibition at ~5 ug CFTRinh-172 (150 g/kg). The duration of inhibition was measured as in<br>
the dose-response study, except that a single 20 g dose of CFTRinh-172 was administered at<br>
different times before or after cholera toxin. Fig. 11, panel B shows significant inhibition of<br><br><br>
luminal fluid accumulation when CFTRinh-172 was administered at 3 hr before or after<br>
cholera toxin. However much less inhibition was seen at 6 hr before cholera toxin. Taking<br>
into account the 6 hr duration of the cholera toxin challenge study, the t1/2 for persistence of<br>
CFTRinh-172 inhibition was ~ 9-10 hr.<br>
Biological Example 6<br>
Oral Bioavailability of CFTRinh-172<br>
[00188]	To test the antidiarrheal efficacy of orally administered CFTRinh-172, CFTRinh-172<br>
pharmacokinetics in mice was determined, and CFTRinh-172 transport across Caco-2<br>
monolayers was measured. Because CFTRinh-172 is a relatively nonpolar weak acid (pKa<br>
5.5) expected to precipitate in the stomach, oral administration was done using two agents<br>
used commonly to solubilize drugs for oral administration - Vitamin E TPGS and<br>
cyclodextriu. Measurements were done using 14C-labeled CFTRinh-172.<br>
[00189]	Fig. 11, panel C shows the pharmacokinetics of I4C-CFTRirih-172 after oral vs.<br>
intravenous administration in mice. Intravenous administration produced high initial serum<br>
concentrations that decreased over ~ 30 rain (tissue redistribution), whereas serum<br>
radioactivity was low just after oral administration, peaked at ~ 60-90 min, and then declined.<br>
Fig. 11, panel D summarizes the organ distribution of 14C-CFTRinh-172 at 6 hr after oral and<br>
intravenous administration, showing accumulation in the gastrointestinal tract as well as the<br>
liver and kidney. 14C radioactivity was concentrated ~10-fold in bile vs. serum, with little<br>
radioactivity excreted in the stool (
suggesting that accumulation of CFTRinn-172 in intestine is facilitated by enterohepatic<br>
circulation. Comparison of oral vs. intravenous CFTRinh-172 administration (tissue/serum<br>
content at 4-6 hr) indicated 15-20 % CFTRinh-172 oral bioavailability in the TPGS<br>
preparation.<br>
[00190]	Fig. 11, panel F shows a linear increase in the appearance of CFTRinh-172 on the<br>
trans-side of Caco-2 monolayers, giving a deduced CFTRinh-172 permeability coefficient of<br>
16x10-6 cm/s. This value is in the range found for various orally-administered drugs (e.g.<br>
pindolol, 36 x 10-6 cm/s, sildenafil, 48 x 10-6 cm/s) (Stenberg et al. J. Med. Chem. 2001<br>
44:1927-1937.<br><br><br>
Biological Example 7<br>
Inhibition of cGMP- and cAMP-Mediated Fluid Secretion<br>
[00191]	An in vivo rat intestinal loop model was used to determine the efficacy of CFTRinh-<br>
172 in inhibiting cGMP- and cAMP-mediated fluid secretion, as well as to test the efficacy<br>
of CFTRinh-172 in an alternative animal model. The guanylyl cyclase C receptor is expressed<br>
in rat enterocytes, permitting STa toxin binding and cytoplasmic cGMP elevation (Mann et<br>
al. Biochem Biophys Res commun 1997 239:463-466). STa toxin has been found to cause<br>
fluid secretion in rat ileum after 3 hr (Cohen et al Am J Physiol 1989 257:G118-123).<br>
CFTRinh-172 prevented cholera-toxin induced fluid secretion in rat intestinal loops (Fig. 12,<br>
panel A) at a dose (600 g/kg) that was effective in mice. For STa toxin-induced fluid<br>
secretion intestinal loops were injected with STa toxin (0.1 g in 300 L PBS) and loop<br>
weight measured after 3 hr. Fig. 12, panel B shows -75% inhibition of intestinal fluid<br>
secretion by CFTRjnh-172.<br>
[00192]	Short-circuit current measurements were done in mouse and human intestinal<br>
epithelial sheets to assess CFTRinh-172 inhibition of transepithelial ion secretion. Fig. 13,<br>
panel A shows CFTRinh-172 dose-dependent inhibition of short-circuit current in mouse<br>
ileum after stimulation by forskolin or STa toxin (inset). Fifty percent inhibition was found<br>
at ~5 M CFTRinh-172 for both cAMP and cGMP-dependent chloride secretion. Fig. 12,<br>
panel B shows similar CFTRinh-172 potency for inhibition of short-circuit current in human<br>
colon.<br>
[00193]	An unexpected observation was that the apparent potency for CFTRinh-172 inhibition<br>
of intestinal short-circuit current (2-5 uM) was substantially lower than that found in<br>
electrophysiological studies done on several cell lines including CFTR-expressing FRT cells<br>
(0.2- 0.5 uM) and Calu-3 cells (0.5 uM). Several explanations for this difference were<br>
considered, including cell-type differences, limited access of CFTRinh-172 to enterocytes in<br>
intact intestine, membrane potential effects (interior-negative cell potential reducing<br>
intracellular [CFTRinh-172]), and ATP competition with CFTRinh-172.<br>
[00194]	Short-circuit current measurements were done on T84 colonic epithelial cells to<br>
investigate this phenomenon. As shown in representative experiments in Fig. 14, panel A, ~3<br>
t<br>
M CFTRinh-172 produced 50% inhibition of short-circuit current in non-permeabilized T84<br>
cell monolayers after stimulation by the cAMP agonist forskolin (left), the cell permeable<br>
cGMP analog 8-Br-cGMP (middle), or the direct activator of CFTR chloride conductance<br>
CFTRact-l 6 identified by high throughput screening. To determine whether the relative<br>
reduction in CFTRinh-172 potency in T84 cells requires an intact cell, short-circuit current<br><br><br>
- measurements were done after permeabilizing the cell basolateral membrane with<br>
amphotericin B and in the presence of a Cl- gradient (to generate measurable currents). Fig.<br>
14, panel B (left) shows substantially greater CFTRinh-172 potency for inhibition of short-<br>
circuit current after permeabilization. Dose-response data summarized in Fig. 14, panel B<br>
(middle) indicate a reduction in apparent KI for CFTRinh-172 inhibition from ~3 to 0.3 M<br>
after cell permeabilization. To test whether the reduced CFTRinh-172 potency in intact cells<br>
is due to the interior-negative membrane potential (reducing cytoplasmic vs. external<br>
[CFTRinh-1723), short circuit current measurements were done in T84 cells after<br>
depolarization by a high-K+ basolateral bathing solution. Fig. 14, panel C shows that<br>
increased CFTRinh-172 potency (KI ~ 0.3 uM) was restored in the depolarized cells,<br>
indicating that cell membrane potential plays a role in CFTRinh-172 potency.<br>
[00195]	Based on the data above, the thiazolidine compounds of the invention, as exemplified<br>
by CFTRinh-172, can be expected to have antidiarrheal efficacy in enterotoxin induced<br>
secretory diarrheas caused by enterotoxogenic organisms such as E. coli and Vibrio cholerae<br>
in cholera, Traveller's and AIDS-complex related diarrheas. CFTR inhibition may be useful<br>
in adjunct therapy of diarrheas caused by entero-invasive bacterias such as Clostridium<br>
difficile and Salmonella species; however, the mucosal damage produced by these organisms<br>
would not be reduced by CFTR inhibition. Similarly, CFTR inhibition would not be<br>
predicted to correct the underlying pathology in inflammatory bowel disease, but could<br>
reduce the volume of intestinal fluid secretions. Recent evidence suggests that fluid secretion<br>
caused by viral diarrheas such as rotavirus may involve other mechanisms such as Ca2+-<br>
mediated Cl- channels, although the role of CFTR in fluid secretions remains unknown and<br>
hence testable by use of the compounds of the invention in suitable animal models.<br>
[001961	Insummary, the thiazolidinone CFTR blocker CFTRinh-172 prevented cAMP and<br>
cGMP induced ion/fluid secretion in rodent and human intestine without affecting intestinal<br>
fluid absorption. Its favorable pharmacological and activity profile support further<br>
development for antidiarrheal applications.<br>
