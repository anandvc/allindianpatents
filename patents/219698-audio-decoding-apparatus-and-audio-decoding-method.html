The present invention relates to a decoding apparatus and decoding method for an audio bandwidth expansion system for generating a wideband audio signal from a narrowband audio signal by adding additional information containing little information, and relates to technology enabling this system to provide high audio quality playback with few calculations.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Many audio encoding technologies for encoding an audio signal to a small data size and then reproducing the audio signal from the coded bitstream are known. The international ISO/IEC 13818-7 (MPEG-2 AAC) standard in particular is known as a superior method enabling high audio quality playback with a small code size. This AAC coding method is also used in the more recent ISO/EC 14496-3 (MPEG-4 Audio) system.<br>
Audio coding methods such as AAC convert a discrete audio signal from the time domain to a signal in the frequency domain by sampling the time-dommn signal at specific time intervals, splitting the converted frequency information into plural frequency bands, and then encoding the signal by quantizing each of the frequency bands based on an appropriate data distribution. For decoding, the frequency information is recreated from the code stream, and the playbjick sound is obtained by converting the frequency information to a time domain signal. If the amount of information supplied for encoding is small (such as in low bitrate encoding), the data size allocated to each of the segmented frequency bands in the coding process decreases, and some frequency bands may as a result contain no information. In this case the decoding process produces playback audio with no sound in the frequency component of tile freuency band containing no information.<br>
In general, because sensitivity to sound with a frequency above approximately 10 kHz is lower than to sound at lower frequencies, high frequency component data is generally dropped to provide narrowband audio playback if the audio coding scheme distributes information by a process based on human auditory perception.<br><br>
If data is supplied at a bitrale of approximately 96 kbps, even the AAC method can code a 44.1 kHz stereo signal to an approximately 16 kHz band, but if data is encoded with data supplied at half this rate, i.e., 48 kbps, the bandwidth that can be quantified and coded while maintaining sound quality is reduced to at most approximately 10 kHz. In addition to being narrowband, playback sound coded with a low 48 Kbps bitrate also sounds cloudy.<br>
A method enabling wideband playback by adding a small amount of additional infonnation to a code stream for narrowband audio playback is described, for example, in the Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM) System Specification (ETSI TS 101 980) published by the European Telecommunication Standards Institute (ETSI). Similar technology known as SBR (spectral band replication) is described, for example, in AES (Audio Engineering Society) convention papers 5553, 5559, 5560 (l12th Convention, 2002 May 10 13, Munich, Germany).<br>
FIG. 2 is a schematic block diagram of an example of a decoder for band expansion using SBR. Input bitstream 206 is separated by the bitstream demultiplexer 201 into low frequency component information 207, high frequency component infonnation 208, and sine wave-adding infonnation 209. The low frequency component information 207 is for example, information encoded using the MPEG-4 AAC or other coding method, and is decoded by the low-band decoder 202 whereby a time signal representing the low frequency component is generated. This time signal representing the low frequency component is separated into multiple (M) subbands by analysis filter bank 203 and input to high fi^quency signal generator 204.<br>
The high frequency signal generator 204 compensates for the high frequency component lost due to bandwidth limiting by copying the low frequency subband signal representing the low frequency component to a high frequency subband. The high frequency component information 208 input to the high frequency signal generator 204 contains gain information for the compensated high frequency subband so that gain is adjusted for each generated high frequency subband.<br><br>
An additional signal generator 211 generates injection signal 212 whereby a gain-controlled sine wave is added to each high frequency subband. The high frequency subhand signal generated by the high frequency signal generator 204 is then input with the low frequency subband signal to the synthesis filter bank 205 for band synthesis, and output signal 2 J 0 is generated. The subband count on the synthesis filter bank side does not need to he the same as the number of subbands on the analysis filter bank side. For example, if in FIG. 2 N=2M, the sampling frequency of the output signal will be twice the samplir^ frequency of the time signal input to the analysis filter bank.<br>
In this configuration the information contained in the high frequency component mformation 208 or sine wave-adding information 209 relates only to gain confrol, and the amount of required information is therefore very small compared with the low frequency component information 207, which also contains spectral information. This method is therefore suited to encoding a wideband signal at a low bitrate.<br>
The synthesis filter bank 205 in FIG. 2 is composed of filters that take both real number input and imaginary number input for each subband, and perform a-complex-valued calculation.<br>
The decoder configured as above for band expansion has two filters, the analysis filter bank and synthesis filter bank, performing complex-valued calculations, and decoding requires many calculations. A problem when the decoder is built for LSI devices, for example, is that power consumption mcreases and the playback time that is possible with a given power supply capacity decreases. Because the signals that we hear in the output from the synthesis filter bank are real-number signals, the synthesis filter bank may be configured with real number filter banks m order to reduce the calculations. While this reduces the number of calculations, if a sine wave is added using the same method as when the synthesis filter bank performs complex-valued calculations, a pure sine wave is not actually added and the intended result is not achieved in the reproduced audio.<br><br>
The present invention is therefore directed to solving these problems of the prior art, and provides a decoding apparatus and method for a band expansion system operating with few calculations by using a real-valued calculation filter bank whereby the intended audio playback is achieved by adding slight change to an added sine wave generation signal such as would be inserted to a complex-valued calculation filter hank.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIG. 13 is a block diagram showing the principle of the present invention. Music and other audio signals contain a low frequency band component and a high frequency band component. Encoded audio signal information is carried by the low frequency band component, and tone information (sinusoidal information) and gain information are carried by the high frequency band component. The receiver decodes the audio signal from the Jow frequency band component, but for the high frequency band component, copies and processes the low frequency band component using the tone information and gain information to synthesize a pseudo-audio signal. Phase information and amplitude information are needed to sjmthesize this pseudo-audio signal, and synthesis thus requires a complex-valued calculation. Because complex-valued calculations require operations on both the real number and imaginary number parts, the calculation process is complex and time-consuming. To simplify this calculation process the present invention operates using only the real number part. However, if the calculations are done using only the real-value part for certain subbands, noise signals appear in the adjacent higher and lower subbands. A compensation signal for cancelling these noise signals is generated using the phase information, amplitude information, and timing information contained in the tone information.<br>
An audio decoding apparatus and method according to a prefened embodiment of the present invention are described below with reference to the accompanying figures.<br>
(Embodiment 1)<br>
FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram showang a decoding apparatus performing bandwidth expansion by arrangement of spectral band replication (SBR) based on a first embodiment of the present invention.<br><br>
The input bitstream 106 is demultiplexed by the bitslream demultiplexer 101 into low frequency component information 107, high frequency component information 108, and sine signal-adding information 109. The low frequency component information 107 is information that is encoded using, for example, the MPEG-4 AAC coding method, is decoded by the low frequency decoder 102, and a time signal representing the low frequency component is generated. The resulting time signal representing the low frequency component is then divided into multiple (M) subbands by the analysis filter bank 103, and input to the bandwidth expansion arrangement (high frequency signal generator) 104. The high fi^quency signal generator 104 copies the low frequency subband signal representing the low frequency component to a high frequency subband to compensate for the high frequency component lost by the bandwidth limit. The high frequency component information 108 input to the high frequency signal generator 104 contains gain information for the high frequency subband to be generated, and the gain is adjusted for each generated high frequency subband.<br>
Additional signal generator 111 produces injection signal 112 so that a gain-controlled sine wave is added to each high frequency subband according to the sine signal-adding information (also called tone information) 109. The high frequency subband signals generated by the high frequency signal generator 104 are input with the low frequency subband signals to the synthesis filter bank 105 for band synthesis, resulting in output signal 110. The number of subbands on the synthesis filter bank does not need to match the mraiber of subbands on the analysis filter bank side. For example, if in FIG. 1 N=2M, the sampling frequency of the output signal will be twice the sampling frequency of the time signal input to the analysis filter bank.<br>
The mput bitstream 106 contains narrowband encoded information for the audio signal (i.e., low frequency component information 107) and additional information for expandmg this narrowband signal to a wideband signal (i.e., high frequency component information 108 and sine signal-adding mformation 109).<br>
The synthesis filter bank 105 of the decoding apparatus shown in FIG. 1 is composed of real-valued calculation filters. It will also be obvious that a complex-valued calculation filter that can perfonn real-valued calculations could be used.<br><br>
The decoding apparatus shown in FIG. 1 also has a compensation signal generator 114 for generating compensation signal 113 for compensating the difference resulting from sinusoidal signal addition.<br>
The input bitstream 106 is demuhiplexed by the bitstream demultiplexer 101 into low frequency component information 107, high frequency component mformation 108, and sine signal-adding information 109.<br>
The low frequency component information 107 is, for example, an MPEG-4 AAC, MPEG-1 Audio, or MPEG-2 Audio encoded bitstream that is decoded by a low frequency decoder 102 having a compatible decoding function, and a time signal representing the low frequency component is generated. The resulting time signal representing the low frequency component is then divided into multiple (M) first subbands SI by the analysis filter bank 103, and input to the high frequency signal generator 104. The analysis fiher bank 103 and synthesis filter bank 105 described below are built from a polyphase filter bank or MDCT converter. Band splitting filter banks are known to one with ordinary skill in the related art.<br>
The first subband signals SI for the low frequency signal component from the analysis filter bank 103 are output directly by the high frequency signal generator 104 and also sent to the synthesis part. The high frequency signal generation part of the high frequency signal generator 104 receives the first subband signals SI and using high frequency component information 108, injection signal 112, and compensation signal 113 generates multiple second subband signals S2. The second subband signals S2 are in a higher frequency band than the first subband signals SI. The high frequency component information 108 includes information indicating which one of the first subband signals SI is to be copied, and which one of the second subband signals S2 is to be generated, and gain control information indicating how much the copied first subband signal S1 should be amplified.<br>
If there is no sine signal-adding information 109 or no signal actually generated using the sme signal-adding information 109, the synthesis filter bank 105 with N (where N is greater or equal to M) subband synthesis filters combines the expanded-bandwidth subband signals output from the high frequency signal generator 104 and the low frequency signal component from the analysis filter bank 103 to produce wideband output signal  110.<br><br>
In this first embodiment of the invention the synthesis filter bank 105 is a real-value calculation filter bank. That is, the synthesis filter bank 105 does not use imaginary number input, only has a real number input part, and uses filters that perform real-valued calculations. This synthesis filter bank 105 is therefore simpler and operates faster than a filter that operates with complex-valued calculations.<br>
If there is sine signal-adding mformation 109, the sine signal-adding infonnation 109 is input to the additional signal generator 111 whereby injection signal 112 is generated, and added to the output signal from high frequency signal generator 104. The sine signal-adding information 109 is also input to the compensation signal generator 114 whereby compensation signal 113 is produced, and similarly added to the output signal of high frequency signal generator 104.<br>
The output signal from high frequency signal generator 104 is input to synthesis filter bank 105. The synthesis filter bank 105 outputs output signal 110 regardless of whether there is an added signal based on sine signal-adding information 109.<br>
Generating the injection signal 112 and compensation signal 113 based on sine signal-adding information 109 is described in further detail below using FIG. 3 and FIG. 4.<br>
FIG. 3 shows the additional signal generator 111 used in the audio decoding method describing the basic principle of the present invention, and FIG. 4 shows the additional signal generator 111 and compensation signal generator 114 in a first embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The additional signal generator 111 is described first with reference to FIG. 3. The information contained in the sine signal-adding information 109 mcludes injected subband number infonnation denoting to which synthesis filter bank the sine wave is injected, phase information denoting the phase at which the injected smusoidal signal starts, timing information denoting the time at which the injected sinusoidal signal starts, and amplitude infonnation denoting the amplitude of the injected sinusoidal signal.<br><br>
Injected subband information extraction arrangement 406 extracts the injected subband number. The phase information extraction arrangement 402 determines, based on the phase information if phase infonnation is contained in the sine signal-adding information 109, the phase at which the injected sinusoidal signal starts. If phase infonnation is not contained in the sine signal-adding information 109, the phase information extraction arrangement 402 determines the phase at which the injected sinusoidal signal starts with consideration for continuity to the phase of the previous time frame.<br>
Amplitude extraction arrangement 403 extracts the amplitude information. Timing extraction arrangement 404 extracts the timing information indicating what time to start sine wave injection and what time to end injection when a sine wave is injected to the synthesis filter bank.<br>
Based on the information from the phase infonnation extraction arrangement 402, amplitude extraction arrangement 403, and timing extraction arrangement 404, the sinusoid generating arrangement 405 generates the sine wave (tone signal) to be injected. It should be noted that the frequency of the generated sine wave can be desirably set to, for example, the center frequency of the subband or a frequency offset a predetermined offset from the center frequency. Further, the frequency could be preset according to the subband number of the injected subband. For example, a sine wave of the upper or lower frequency limit of the subband could be generated according to whether the subband number is odd or even. It is assumed below that a sine wave with the center frequency of the subband is produced, i.e., a periodic signal with four subband signal sampling periods is produced.<br>
The sine wave injection arrangement 407 inserts the sine wave output by sinusoid generating arrangement 405 to the synthesis filter subband matching the number acquired by the injected subband infonnation extraction arrangement 406. The output signal from sine wave injection anangement 407 is injection signal 112.<br>
Consider a complex-valued signal with four periods and amplitude S injected to subband K as shown in the table in FIG. 6. The values denoted (a,b) in the table mean the complex-valued signal a+jb. where j is an imaginary value. Referring to FIG. 5A, the signal inserted to subband K in FIG. 6 is a periodic signal that changes 501, 502, 503, 504 in FIG. 5A due to the relationship between the real-value part and the imaginary value part.<br><br><br>
If, unlike in the present invention, the synthesis filter bank is a filter that takes complex-valued input and performs complex-valued calculations, the output signal of the decoding system obtained by this injection signal has a single frequency spectrum and a so-called pure sine wave is injected. However, if the synthesis filter bank is a filter that takes only real-value input and performs only real-value calculations as in the present invention, a real-number signal not containing the imaginary number part shown in FIG. 6 is injected to subband K as shown in FIG. 7. With this injection signal the decoding system using a synthesis filter that takes only real values outputs a single frequency spectrum as shown in FIG. 9 (spectrum 902 of the injected sine wave) and unwanted spectrums in the bands above and below the sine wave spectrum (unwanted spectrum 903). This is because a synthesis filter using real-valued calculation cannot completely eliminate spectrum leakage into adjacent subbands due to the filter characteristics, and these spectrum leaks appear as aliasing components.<br>
By providing a compensation signal generator 114 as shown in FIG. 4 in addition to the additional signal generator 11 ] shown in FIG. 3 in a synthesis filter bank using real-valued calculation with only real value input, the unwanted spectrum components shown in FIG. 9 can be removed.<br>
Additional signal generator 111 and compensation signal generator 114 according to the present invention are described next with reference to FIG. 4. In FIG. 4 the sine signal-adding mformation 109, phase information extraction arrangement 402, amplitude extraction arrangement 403, timing extraction arrangement 404, sinusoid generating arrangement 405, injected subband information extraction arrangement 406, sine wave injection arrangement 407, and injection signal 408 are the same as described with reference to FIG. 3. What differs from FIG. 3 is the addition of compensation subband information determining arrangement 409 and compensation signal generator 410.<br>
The compensation subband information determining arrangement 409 determines the<br>
subband to be compensated based on the information obtained by the injected subband<br>
information extraction arrangement 406 indicating the number of the synthesis filter bank to<br>
which the sine wave is injected. The subband to be compensated is a subband near the<br>
1 '&gt;<br><br>
subband to which the sine wave is injected, and may be a high frequency subband or low frequency subband. The high frequency subband and low frequency subband to be compensated will vary according to the characteristics of the synthesis filter bank 105, but are here assumed to be the subbands adjacent to the subband of the injected sine wave. For example, when the sine wave is injected to subband K, subband K+1 and subband K-1 are, respectively, the high frequency subband and low frequency subband to be compensated.<br>
The compensation signal generator 410 generates a signal cancelling aliasing spectra in the compensated subband based on the output of phase information extraction arrangement 402, amplitude extraction arrangement 403, and timing extraction arrangement 404, and outputs this signal as compensation signal 113. This compensation signal 113 is added to the input signal to the synthesis filter bank 105 in the same way as injection signal 112. The amplitude S and phase of the compensation signal 113 are adjusted for subband K-1 and subband K+1 as shown in the table in FIG. 8.<br>
In FIG. 8 Alpha and Beta are values determined according to the characteristics of the specific synthesis filter bank, and more specifically are determined with consideration for the amount of spectrum leakage to adjacent subbands in the filter bank.<br>
As will be known from FIG. 8, if a sinusoidal signal is added to subband K, the amplitude of a sinusoidal signal of cycle period T is amplitude S at lime 0, amplitude 0 at time lT/4, amplitude -S at time 2T/4, and amplitude 0 at time 3T/4. A compensation signal is applied to subband K-1 and subband K+1. In the drawings, TTMEs 0, 1, 2 and 3 correspond to times 0, lT/4, 2T/4 and 3T/4, respectively.<br>
The compensation signal applied to subband K-1 has amplitude 0 at time 0, amplitude Alpha*S at time lT/4, amplitude 0 at time 2T/4, and amplitude Beta*S at time 3T/4.<br>
The compensation signal applied to subband K+1 has amplitude 0 at time 0, amplitude Beta*S at time lT/4, amplitude 0 at time 2T/4, and amplitude Alpha*S at time<br>
3T/4.<br><br>
FIG. 10 is a spectrum graph for the sine wave injected by a preferred embodiment of this invention. As will be known from FIG. 10, the unwanted spectrum component 903 observed in FIG. 9 is suppressed.<br>
By introducing this compensation signal, unwanted spectrum components are not produced even if a sinusoidal signal is injected to a real-value filter bank, and a sine wave can be injected to a desired subband with minimal calculations.<br>
The invention has been described with reference to a sinusoidal signal injected to subband K where the initial phase is 0 and either the real-value part or imaginary-value part goes to 0 as shown in FIG. 5A. As shown in FIG. 5B, however, the present invention can also be applied when the phase is shifted .delta, from the state shown in FIG. 5A. The relationship between the injection signal and compensation signal in this case can be expressed as shown in the table in FIG. 11, for example, where S, P, and Q are values determined according to the characteristics of the filter bank with consideration for the amount of spectrum leakage by the filter bank to adjacent subbands.<br>
Furthermore, for a subband K to which the sine wave is injected a compensation signal is injected to adjacent subbands K-1 and K+1, but adjacent subbands other than K-1 and K+1 may need correction depending on the characteristics of the synthesis filter. In this case the compensation signal is simply injected to the subbands that need correction.<br>
(Embodiment 2)<br>
FIG. 12 is a schematic diagram showing an additional signal generator in a second embodiment of the present invention. This additional signal generator differs from the additional signal generator, 111 shown in FIG. 4 in that interpolated information 120) calculated by the sinusoid generating arrangement 405 is input to compensation signal generator 410 so that the compensation signal 113 is calculated based on the interpolated information 1201.<br><br>
The sinusoid generating arrangement 405 in the above first embodiment adjusts the amplitude of the generated sine wave based only on the amplitude information of the current frame extracted by the amplitude extraction arrangement 403. The sinusoid generating arrangement 405 of this second embodiment, however, interpolates the amplitude information using amplitude information from neighboring frames, and adjusts the amplitude of the generated sine wave based on this mterpolated amplitude information.<br>
Because the amplitude of the generated sine wave changes smoothly as a result of this process, the observed sound quality of the ou^ut signal can be improved.<br>
Because the amplitude of the generated sine wave is changed by interpolation with this configuration, the amplitude of the corresponding compensation signal must also be adjusted. Therefore, the interpolated information output by the sinusoid generating arrangement 405 is also input to the compensation signal generator 410 to adjust the amplitude of the compensation signal 113 synchronized to the interpolated variable amplitude of the sine wave.<br>
This configuration of the invention can correctly calculate the compensation signal and suppress unwanted spectrum components even when the amplitude of the generated sine wave is interpolated.<br>
It will also be apparent that the process of the audio decoding apparatus shown in FIG. 1 can also be written in software using a programming language. In addition, this software  program  can be  recorded to  and  distributed by a data recording  medium.<br>
When using a synthesis filter bank that reduces the number of operations by using only real-valued calculations, unwanted spectrum components accompanying sine wave addition can be suppressed and only the desired sine wave can be mjected by injecting a compensation signal to the low frequency or high frequency subband of the subband to which the sine wave is added.<br><br><br>
