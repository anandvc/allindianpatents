Method for purifying CO2 gasflow<br>
The invention relates to a process for purifying	CO2<br>
offgas streams to free them of chemical compounds	and<br>
to the recycling of the purified gas streams into	the<br>
production process.<br>
Such offgases occur in particular in the preparation of<br>
methionine and comprise, in addition to methyl<br>
mercaptan, generally also ammonia, hydrocyanic acid and<br>
steam.<br>
Such a methionine process is described, for example, in<br>
EP-B 0780370 = US 5,770,769 and US 5990349.<br>
The underlying process steps can be illustrated as<br>
follows:<br>
Step 1: formation of 5-(2-methylmercapto)hydantoin<br><br>
Step 2: hydrolysis of the hydantoin to form the<br>
methionine potassium salt<br><br>
Step 3: stripping of NH3 and CO2 from the hydrolysis<br>
mixture<br><br><br>
Step 4: release of solid methionine from its potassium<br>
salt<br><br>
Step 5: separation of solid methionine and mother<br>
liquor<br><br>
Step 6: heat treatment of the mother liquor to release<br>
CO2 and recycling into step 2:<br><br>
The overall equation of the methionine synthesis by the<br>
above process has the following appearance:<br><br>
The recycling of K2CO3 and NH3 according to the<br>
abovementioned partial steps does not constitute any<br>
problem.<br><br>
However, when steps 2 and 3 are considered, it can be<br>
seen that, from a stoichiometric point of view, 1.5 mol<br>
of CO2 can be released from these per mole of NH3.<br>
According to EP 0 780 370 A, these volatile components<br>
may be recycled into the stage of hydantoin formation<br>
(step 1).<br>
However, according to the stoichiometry of the<br>
reaction, 0.5 mol of CO2 leaves this stage without<br>
reaction unutilized as offgas.<br>
Simple recycling is not possible since the chemical<br>
analysis of the offgas shows that it comprises, based<br>
on the CO2 content, methyl mercaptan (Mc) in amounts of<br>
1 - 10% by weight. The methyl mercaptan-containing<br>
offgas cannot be utilized in the methionine<br>
precipitation (step 4) , since the product which has<br>
been filtered off would be greatly odour-afflicted. In<br>
addition, the methyl mercaptan, owing to its acid<br>
character, would accumulate as potassium<br>
methylmercaptide in the process solutions, which would<br>
lead to disruptions in the methionine workup. The<br>
methyl mercaptan content of the offgas from the<br>
hydantoin synthesis has two causes. One is that the<br>
methylmercaptopropionaldehyde (MMP) used as a raw<br>
material, as a result of the process, always comprises<br>
a certain methyl mercaptan residue content (see<br>
US 4,048,232 and US 3,878,057); the other is that<br>
methyl mercaptan can form by thermal decomposition of<br>
methionine, mainly in the hydantoin hydrolysis<br>
supported by potassium carbonate (step 2) . The thermal<br>
decomposition of methionine is also described in<br>
EP 839 804.<br>
For the reasons mentioned, the offgas is incinerated<br>
according to the prior art, in the course of which CO2<br>
and methyl mercaptan are lost and considerable costs<br>
for the combustion simultaneously arise.<br><br>
US 4,319,044 already discloses a process for preparing<br>
5-(2-methylmercapto)hydantoin, in which the hydrogen<br>
cyanide present in the offgas consisting mainly of CO2<br>
and the methyl mercaptan are recovered by multistage<br>
scrubbing. According to this process, the offgas is<br>
initially contacted either with an ammonium carbonate<br>
or a dilute hydantoin solution in order to bind HCN.<br>
The HCN-laden solution is recycled into the hydantoin<br>
synthesis. In a second scrubbing stage, the offgas<br>
which still comprises methyl mercaptan and ammonia is<br>
scrubbed with water in order to remove NH3. In the<br>
third scrubbing stage, the offgas is counter-scrubbed<br>
with methylmercaptopropionaldehyde (MMP), which binds<br>
the methyl mercaptan as hemithioacetal. A disadvantage<br>
of this process is that CO2, as the quantitatively most<br>
significant proportion of the offgas stream, escapes<br>
unutilized. Moreover, an additional waste stream is<br>
formed in the process mentioned as a result of the<br>
emission of the water scrubbing described there, which<br>
comprises the toxic substances ammonia and methyl<br>
mercaptan, whose disposal is associated with high<br>
costs.<br>
The process described in the US patent 4,319,044<br>
additionally possesses the disadvantage that the offgas<br>
stream, in the course of the scrubbing process, comes<br>
into contact with MMP last.<br>
Hence, it is saturated with MMP at least in accordance<br>
with the specific vapour pressure and is only<br>
recyclable to a limited extent.<br>
It is an object of the invention to purify offgas<br>
streams consisting mainly of CO2 to free them of<br>
chemical compounds contained therein in such a way that<br>
the purified CO2 can subsequently be recycled into the<br>
production process.<br>
The invention provides a process for purifying CO2-<br><br>
containing gas streams having a content of methyl<br>
mercaptan, in which the gas is scrubbed in the<br>
specified sequence<br>
a)	with water or with water in which<br>
methylmercaptopropionaldehyde (MMP) is present<br>
dissolved up to a maximum of the solubility limit,<br>
b)	subsequently with MMP and<br>
c)	then with water, and<br>
d)	the thus purified CO2 is recycled into the<br>
production process.<br>
The process is particularly suitable when the gas<br>
comprises one or more additional fractions selected<br>
from the group of hydrocyanic acid, ammonia and water.<br>
Preference is given to a process for purifying CO2<br>
offgases obtained in a process for preparing<br>
methionine, in which 3-methylmercaptopropionaldehyde<br>
(MMP), hydrogen cyanide, ammonia and carbon dioxide, or<br>
those components from which the aforementioned<br>
components can be prepared, are converted to<br>
5-(2-methylmercaptoethyl)hydantoin, this is hydrolysed<br>
and the methionine is precipitated with the<br>
introduction of CO2, where the CO2-containing offgas<br>
exiting from the hydantoin synthesis reactor is<br>
subjected to the abovementioned at least three-stage<br>
scrubbing process, and<br>
a)	the resulting scrubbing liquids are recycled into<br>
the preparation process for methionine or its<br>
precursors, and<br>
b)	the purified CO2 gas stream is introduced into an<br>
alkali metal salt solution of the methionine-<br>
containing reactor, and methionine is precipitated<br><br>
from this salt.<br>
The offgas exiting from the hydantoin synthesis reactor<br>
contains generally 60 to 75% by weight of CO2, 0.01 to<br>
0.1% by weight of hydrocyanic acid, 1 to 10% by weight<br>
of methyl mercaptan, 0.5 to 5% by weight of ammonia and<br>
15 to 25% by weight of water.<br>
The ammonia-containing scrubbing liquid from washing<br>
step a) is introduced into the hydantoin synthesis<br>
reactor.<br>
The methyl mercaptan-containing scrubbing liquid from<br>
scrubbing step b) is introduced into the MMP synthesis,<br>
and the MMP-containing scrubbing liquid from scrubbing<br>
step c) is used as scrubbing liquid for scrubbing step<br>
a) .<br>
In scrubbing step b), the amount	of MMP used	is<br>
selected in such a way that the	molar ratio	of<br>
MMP:methyl mercaptan (gaseous) is	1:1 to 3:1,	in<br>
particular 1:1 to 2:1.<br>
The scrubbing is carried out at a temperature of 10 to<br>
60°C, in particular 10 to 40°C.<br>
The pressure in the scrubbing apparatus is generally 1<br>
to 10 bar higher than that in the precipitation reactor<br>
for methionine. Suitable scrubbing apparatuses are in<br>
particular multistage columns having intermediate<br>
column bottoms or columns having valve or bubble-cap<br>
trays.<br>
The scrubbing is effected in countercurrent. The<br>
purified gas has a CO2 content of &gt; 98% by weight, in<br>
particular &gt; 99% by weight to 99.8% by weight. In<br>
addition, the CO2-containing gas obtained from the<br>
workup of the mother liquor obtained in the methionine<br>
process (step 6), from which the water has been<br><br>
condensed out, can be passed through the scrubbing<br>
 apparatus (Figure 2).<br>
5-(2-Methylmercaptoethyl)hydantoin is prepared<br>
according to EP 0 780 370 A by preparing a solution of<br>
hydrogen cyanide in 3-methylmercaptopropionaldehyde and<br>
a solution of ammonia and carbon dioxide in water,<br>
rapidly and intimately mixing these solutions and<br>
reacting them. The solution of hydrogen cyanide in<br>
3-methylmercaptopropionaldehyde is appropriately<br>
adjusted in such a way that it consists of equimolar<br>
proportions of hydrogen cyanide and 3-methylmercapto-<br>
propionaldehyde, or else comprises excess proportions<br>
of hydrogen cyanide. In general, it is advantageous not<br>
to select the proportion of hydrogen cyanide in the<br>
solution at greater than 1.1 mol per mole of 3-methyl-<br>
mercaptopropionaldehyde; the solution preferably<br>
contains 1.005 to 1.05 mol of hydrogen cyanide per mole<br>
of 3-methylmercaptopropionaldehyde.<br>
The solution of ammonia and carbon dioxide in water may<br>
be a saturated or dilute solution; advantageously, the<br>
content of ammonia is not below about 5% by weight. The<br>
molar ratio of ammonia to carbon dioxide is<br>
appropriately about 1.2 to 4.0 mol, preferably 1.6 to<br>
1.8 mol, of ammonia per mole of carbon dioxide. The<br>
solution of hydrogen cyanide in 3-methylmercapto-<br>
propionaldehyde is mixed with the solution of ammonia<br>
and carbon dioxide in water in such a way that a molar<br>
ratio of ammonia to 3-methylmercaptopropionaldehyde of<br>
about 1.2 to 6:1.0 is appropriately present in the<br>
mixture, preferably 2.0 to 4.0:1.0, in particular 2.5<br>
to 3.0:1.0. The reaction is performed at ambient<br>
temperature or higher, appropriately at temperatures<br>
above 60°C, advantageously between about 80°C and<br>
140°C. Preference is given to selecting temperatures<br>
between 80 and 130°C, in particular between 90 and<br>
12 0°C. Although the reaction can proceed at any<br>
pressure, it is appropriate to work at elevated<br><br>
pressure; advantageous pressures are found to be up to<br>
20 bar, in particular pressures which are 2 to 3 bar<br>
above the equilibrium pressure of the reaction mixture.<br>
The reaction time depends upon the reaction conditions,<br>
in particular upon the temperature and upon the<br>
quantitative ratios.<br>
In the preferred procedure, it is particularly<br>
advantageous to introduce the solution of hydrogen<br>
cyanide in 3-methylmercaptopropionaldehyde and the<br>
solution of ammonia and carbon dioxide in water into a<br>
reaction mixture of these substances, i.e. into a<br>
mixture formed beforehand in the reaction of the<br>
solutions, in which the reaction of hydantoin has<br>
proceeded to completion or in part, and to perform the<br>
reaction in this mixture.<br>
It is particularly advantageous to select a continuous<br>
procedure, to conduct the reaction mixture in<br>
circulation for this purpose, to constantly feed the<br>
solutions of hydrogen cyanide in 3-methylmercapto-<br>
propionaldehyde and of ammonia and carbon dioxide in<br>
water at two adjacent points in this circuit, and to<br>
constantly remove a corresponding proportion of the<br>
reaction mixture from the circulation at another point.<br>
The process for preparing methionine or an alkali metal<br>
salt of methionine by hydrolysis of 5-(2-methyl-<br>
mercaptoethyl) hydantoin in the presence of an aqueous<br>
solution comprising alkali metal and carbon dioxide,<br>
and optional further reaction to give methionine, the<br>
hydrolysis being carried out at least at the start in<br>
the presence of at least 0.1 eq. , in particular up to<br>
7 eq., of ammonia per equivalent of 5-(2-methyl-<br>
mercaptoethyl)hydantoin, is likewise known from the EP<br>
document.<br>
It has been found that it is particularly advantageous<br>
when the hydrolysis is carried out from the start in<br><br>
the presence of alkali metal and carbon dioxide, i.e.<br>
that in particular a mixture of alkali metal compounds<br>
is present, in particular alkali metal<br>
hydrogencarbonate, alkali metal carbonate, alkali metal<br>
hydroxide, alkali metal being in particular potassium<br>
and sodium. The amount of alkali metal and carbon<br>
dioxide is appropriately at least the stoichiometric<br>
amount based on the hydantoin. This can be distinctly<br>
exceeded at the upper end. A molar ratio with an excess<br>
of about 3:1 based on the hydantoin is particularly<br>
advantageous; in principle, it can be assumed that an<br>
even greater excess is even more favourable. However,<br>
particular preference is given in practice to ratios of<br>
about 1.5:1-2:1. According to the invention, some<br>
ammonia is additionally added, which is correspondingly<br>
likewise partly also present in the form of ammonia<br>
compounds. It is particularly advantageous in this<br>
context when, at the start of the hydrolysis, max.<br>
7 mol of ammonia (incl. ammonium compounds) are present<br>
per mole of 5-(2-methylmercaptoethyl)hydantoin. This<br>
achieves progress of the hydrolysis virtually without<br>
by-product formation and in good yields, and secondly<br>
only little alkali metal carbonate, if any,<br>
precipitates out. It is particularly advantageous in<br>
this context when ammonia and/or carbon dioxide, if<br>
appropriate together with water, are discharged from<br>
the reaction system during the hydrolysis. This allows<br>
the reaction conditions to be controlled particularly<br>
favourably, so that still no alkali metal carbonate<br>
precipitates out and the reaction proceeds to<br>
completion.<br>
The hydrolysis processes are favourably carried out at<br>
a temperature of 120 to 250°C and correspondingly a<br>
pressure of 5 to 3 0 bar. In this range, very good<br>
conversions and low by-product formation result. It is<br>
also advantageous when the alkali metal component is<br>
used in an at least equimolar amount based on the 5- (2-<br>
methylmercaptoethyl)hydantoin. In that case, in<br><br>
addition to the full hydrolysis, the corresponding<br>
alkali metal salt of methionine is also obtained<br>
virtually quantitatively. The hydrolysis solution<br>
preferably also already comprises methionine or its<br>
salt at the start; this too has a favourable,<br>
presumably autocatalytic effect on the hydrolysis.<br>
In this procedure, virtually all of the ammonia and all<br>
of the carbon dioxide can advantageously be removed<br>
from the hydrolysis solution in the course of or after<br>
the hydrolysis, so that the hydrolysate can be removed<br>
substantially free of ammonia and carbon dioxide.<br>
Here too, it is particularly advantageous to carry out<br>
the process continuously. It is very particularly<br>
advantageous in this context that the processes<br>
described hitherto can be connected together, in<br>
particular as a fully continuous process in which<br>
carbon dioxide and ammonia can be recycled.<br>
Methionine is released from alkali metal methionate in<br>
aqueous solution by introducing carbon dioxide, the<br>
release preferably being carried out in a stirred cell<br>
reactor with intensive mixing or in a stirred reactor<br>
with virtually ideal mixing.<br>
In the release of the methionine from the aqueous<br>
solution by means of carbon dioxide, it is particularly<br>
advantageous when the carbon dioxide is introduced into<br>
the aqueous solution via a nozzle device in the region<br>
of the bottom. This in turn promotes the release of the<br>
methionine. Moreover, the release is advantageously<br>
carried out at a pressure of 1 to 3 0 bar, preferably<br>
also at a temperature of 0 to 100°C.<br>
Very particularly advantageously, an aqueous solution<br>
is used which is substantially free of ammonia.<br>
The last procedure too is particularly favourably<br><br>
carried out continuously.<br>
The inventive method makes it possible to operate the<br>
methionine process without CO2 loss. Further undesired<br>
offgas or wastewater streams do not occur.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
As described in EP 0780370, the hydantoin hydrolysis<br>
(K 2) is carried out preferably at a pressure of<br>
7-9 bar and the release of the methionine from its<br>
potassium salt with CO2 in (R 2) at a pressure of 2 to<br>
5 bar. It is therefore particularly advantageous to<br>
keep the plant parts hydantoin hydrolysis (K 2),<br>
hydantoin reactor (R 1) and the CO2 scrubbing system<br>
together at a higher pressure than the reactor (R 2) ,<br>
so that the purified CO2 (6) passes into the<br>
precipitation reactor (R 2) without further conveying<br>
units. It is further advantageous to combine the 3-<br>
stage CO2 scrubbing as explained above in one column<br>
having two intermediate column bottoms in order to<br>
minimize the apparatus demands.<br>
With reference to Figure 1 and the process steps<br>
detailed at the outset, the invention is illustrated in<br>
detail:<br>
HCN (1) and MMP (2) are fed to the continuously<br>
operated hydantoin reactor (R 1) (step 1) . Via 3, the<br>
reaction partners NH3 and CO2 also pass into it from the<br>
hydrolysis and stripping column (K 2) (step 2 + 3) .<br>
Excess Mc- and NH3-containing CO2 leaves the hydantoin<br>
reactor (R 1) via 5 and is washed to free it of NH3<br>
with aqueous solution 8 in the lower section of the<br>
scrubbing column (K 1, C). Subsequently, the gas enters<br>
the scrubbing zone (K 1, B) from below and is washed to<br>
free it of Mc in countercurrent with MMP (10). Finally,<br><br>
the gas is finely purified with water (7) and leaves<br>
the column (K 1) via 6. The Mc-laden MMP<br>
(hemithioacetal) leaves the column (K 1) via 11 and is<br>
fed to MMP synthesis.<br>
The purified CO2 is combined with the CO2 obtained from<br>
the workup (18) and serves to precipitate the<br>
methionine from the hydrolysis solution (11) in the<br>
reactor (R 2) (step 4) . The suspension (13) is<br>
filtered, the filtercake (14) sent to further workup<br>
(step 5). The filtrates (15) are concentrated by<br>
evaporation (step 6) . The concentrate (16) serves as<br>
the K2CO3 source for the hydantoin hydrolysis in the<br>
column (K 2) . The energy supply and the stripping<br>
effect are brought about by the steam supply 2 0 (step 2<br>
+ 3) .<br>
From the vapours of the evaporative concentration,<br>
water (19) is condensed out and the CO2 which remains<br>
thereafter (18) is combined with the CO2 from the<br>
scrubbing column (K 1) and fed to the reactor R 2 (step<br>
4) .<br>
The reactive absorption of Mc into MMP can be carried<br>
out particularly advantageously when the column portion<br>
(K 1, B) consists of valve or bubble-cap trays or a<br>
comparable construction. This technical design has the<br>
advantage that it enables a minimal MMP to Mc gas<br>
ratio. This minimizes the cost and inconvenience of<br>
conveying the amount of MMP used for the scrubbing. In<br>
the present case, it is advantageously possible to<br>
quantitatively scrub out the Mc content in the CO2 gas<br>
with a minimal, i.e. almost stoichiometric, amount of<br>
MMP.<br>
This process does not comprise any additionally<br>
unutilized offgas/wastewater streams.<br>
It is also possible to pass the CO2-containing offgas<br><br>
stream formed in the workup of the mother liquor fully<br>
or partly (step 6) likewise through the scrubber<br>
(Figure 2) .<br>
This is advantageous in order to recover the methyl<br>
mercaptan likewise present therein. Typically, this<br>
stream contains 97 to 99% by weight of CO2, 0.1 to 1%<br>
by weight of water and 0.1 to 1% by weight of methyl<br>
mercaptan.<br>
This shifts the CO2 content in the overall offgas<br>
stream to be scrubbed to higher values in comparison to<br>
the content in the offgas from the hydantoin synthesis<br>
reactor. The reduction in the concentration of the<br>
remaining constituents has no influence on the<br>
effectiveness of the scrubbing.<br>
Example 2<br>
A plant as described in Figure 1 is operated with a<br>
production output of 100 kg/h of methionine.<br>
In the hydantoin reactor R1, an offgas amount of<br>
22.1 kg/h with the composition of 68% by weight of CO2,<br>
27% by weight of water, 3.6% by weight of methyl<br>
mercaptan, 0.9% by weight of NH3 and 0.5% by weight of<br>
other components is obtained at 80°C.<br>
This crude gas is treated in countercurrent in the<br>
three-stage column K1, A, B, C, the operating pressure<br>
at the top of the column being 6 bar gauge.<br>
In zone C of the column K1, the gas stream is scrubbed<br>
with 15 kg/h of water at 30°C which is drawn from the<br>
discharge of zone A.<br>
On entry into the scrubbing zone B of the column Kl,<br>
the gas stream has the composition: 91% by weight of<br>
CO2, 4.8% by weight of methyl mercaptan, 3.6% by weight<br><br>
of water and 0.4% by weight of other components.<br>
In the scrubbing zone B, washing is effected in<br>
countercurrent at 20°C with 2 kg/h of methyl-<br>
mercaptopropionaldhyde. Afterwards, the gas stream has<br>
the composition: 99.8% by weight of CO2, 0.01% by<br>
weight of MMP and 
Methyl mercaptan is no longer detectable by gas<br>
chromatography.<br>
For fine purification, the gas is also conducted<br>
through the zone A and freed of entrained MMP with<br>
15 kg/h of water.<br>
The thus purified gas has a content of &gt; 99.8% by<br>
weight of CO2.<br><br>
