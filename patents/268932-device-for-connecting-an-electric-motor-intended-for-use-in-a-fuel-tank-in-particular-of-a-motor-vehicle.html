				<td>Description<br>
Device for connecting an electric motor intended for use in a<br>
fuel tank, in particular of a motor vehicle<br>
The invention relates to a device for connecting an electric<br>
motor intended for use in a fuel tank, in particular of a motor<br>
vehicle, having connection contacts, having carbon brushes<br>
which slide over an armature of a rotor, and having electrical<br>
leads arranged between the connection contacts and the carbon<br>
brushes.<br>
Devices of this kind are usually produced as a unit together<br>
with the carbon brushes and are known in practice. In this<br>
case, the electric motor used in the fuel tank serves to drive<br>
a fuel pump. In the device known from practice, the connection<br>
contacts are mounted on a plastic part. The electric motor can<br>
be connected to a power supply system of the motor vehicle via<br>
the connection contacts. In addition, an interference-<br>
suppression part which has one capacitor and two interference-<br>
suppression inductors is usually arranged in the plastic part.<br>
The plastic part is connected to the electric motor. The<br>
subregion of the lead which is routed out of the plastic part<br>
is designed as a flexible copper wire and routed as far as the<br>
respective carbon brush which is in contact with a collector of<br>
the electric motor. One disadvantage of the known device is<br>
that the electrical lead is corroded and subsequently destroyed<br>
in aggressive media, for example fuel.<br>
DE 199 21 540 Al discloses extrusion coating the region of the<br>
connecting point of an electrical lead to a contact element<br>
with a fuel-resistant plastic. The fuel-resistant plastics<br>
mentioned are POM and PPS. It has been found here that<br>
extrusion coating with POM or PPS leads to a high degree of<br>
rigidity of the<br><br>
electrical lead. Due to wear of the carbon brushes, they have<br>
to be adjusted in order to remain in contact with the<br>
collector. Permanent contact between the carbon brushes which<br>
are subject to wear and the collector is no longer ensured due<br>
to the high degree of rigidity of the electrical lead.<br>
The invention is based on the object of providing a device of<br>
the abovementioned type which firstly is effectively protected<br>
against attacks by aggressive media and secondly ensures<br>
permanent contact between the carbon brushes and the collector<br>
of the electric motor.<br>
According to the invention, the object is achieved in that the<br>
electrical leads have a sheath comprising<br>
polytetrafluoroethylene.<br>
The very high degree of fuel resistance and the low tendency to<br>
swell of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) allows a sheath of<br>
electrical leads to be designed with a low wall thickness. On<br>
account of the low wall thickness of the sheath, electrical<br>
leads of this type have a very high degree of flexibility.<br>
Consequently, the electrical lead is sufficiently mobile to<br>
follow adjustment movements of the carbon brushes as a result<br>
of wear. This therefore ensures that the carbon brushes are in<br>
permanent contact with the collector of the electric motor over<br>
the entire service life.<br>
In an advantageous refinement, sheaths with a wall thickness of<br>
only 0.1 mm can be produced, as a result of which the<br>
electrical leads are provided with a particularly high degree<br>
of flexibility.<br>
In a further advantageous refinement of the invention, in which<br>
the electrical component is arranged in a housing and the<br>
electrical leads are routed out of the housing, the sheath of<br><br>
the cable wire simultaneously serves as a seal between the<br>
electrical leads and the housing.<br><br>
The invention will be explained in greater detail using an<br>
exemplary embodiment. In the associated drawing<br>
fig. 1 schematically shows a longitudinal section through an<br>
electric motor having a device according to the<br>
invention, and<br>
fig. 2 shows a greatly enlarged illustration of the device<br>
according to the invention.<br>
Figure 1 shows an electric motor I having a rotor 3, which is<br>
rotatably mounted in a housing 2, and having a stator 4. In<br>
order to be supplied with electric power, the rotor 3 has an<br>
armature 5 over which carbon brushes 6, 7 slide. Electric power<br>
is supplied to the armature 5 via a device 8 having connection<br>
contacts 9, 10 and having electrical leads 11, 12 between which<br>
an interference-suppression part 13 is arranged. The electrical<br>
leads 11, 12 are conducted to the carbon brushes 6, 7. Plug-<br>
type contacts (not illustrated) of a power supply system can be<br>
connected to the connection contacts 9, 10. This electric motor<br>
1 is intended to drive a fuel pump of a motor vehicle, and fuel<br>
flows through said electric motor.<br>
Figure 2 shows the device 8 from figure 1 on a greatly enlarged<br>
scale. The device 8 has a plastic part 14 for holding the<br>
connection contacts 9, 10 and in each case an inductor 15, 16<br>
arranged between the connection contacts 9, 10 and electrical<br>
leads 11, 12. The connection contacts 9, 10 are jointly<br>
connected to a capacitor 17. The inductors 15, 16 and the<br>
capacitor 17 form the interference-suppression part 13. The<br>
electrical leads 11, 12 connect the electric motor 1<br>
(illustrated in figure 1) to the poles of a power supply<br>
system. The two electrical leads 11, 12 comprise copper wires<br>
18, 19 which are extrusion coated with PTFE 20, 21. For the<br>
purposes of improved illustration, the electrical leads 11, 12<br>
are illustrated on an enlarged scale. Despite being extrusion<br><br>
coated with PTFE 20, 21, the electrical leads are so flexible<br>
that they move at the same time<br><br>
as the carbon brushes 6, 7 wear away, and reliably ensure power<br>
is supplied to the electric motor 1 which is illustrated in<br>
figure 1.<br><br>
