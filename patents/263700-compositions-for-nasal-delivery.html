Nasal drug delivery is a popular way to treat local/respiratory ailments which has traditionally been restricted to administer drugs for sinus conditions, such as congestion ' and allergies. Recently, however, there has been increased interest in the nose as an alternative to oral and parenteral delivery for many systemic drugs and vaccines. The vastly vascularised and immunogenic nasal mucosa present potential benefits for systemic absorption in terms of quick action, avoidance of any degradation and/or unwanted entero-hepatic metabolism of the drug (improved bio-availability) and patient compliance as well as improved immune response for vaccines. The nasal route .could also provide an attractive needle-free alternative for currently injectable drugs which may improve patient compliance and allow extended use of self-medication for many chronic diseases/acute conditions or vaccinations. Some systemically-acting drugs for the treatment of osteporosis, cardiovascular medications and painkillers are already on the market in nasal formulations.<br>
However, although this route is beginning to be explored for systemic delivery of drugs the major limitation in nasal delivery is the insufficient permeation of drugs across the nasal mucosa. Furthermore, the anatomical and physiological features of the nose are not ideal for drug administration, since a relatively small surface area (150 cm ) puts considerable constraints on formulations and drug candidates. Only very potent molecules can be used in this route. For example, for peptides there is the inverse relationship between bioavailability and molecular weight of the peptide which points toward, that those peptides with more than 30-40 amino acids require penetration enhancers for attaining a sufficient bioavailability (in the range of 10%). There are two main pathways for absorption of the molecule from the nasal cavity: paracellular (driven by passive diffusion) or transcellular (driven by carrier or receptor mediated active transport). In the absence of active transport components, most peptides cross the nasal epithelium by the paracellular route, driven by passive diffusion. Due to hydrophilicity of peptides the transcellular route is mainly relevant for transport processes or for transcytosis. Both transcellular routes are energy dependent and are therefore designated as active transport processes.<br><br>
The issue of improving nasal absorption is important. Several strategies have been investigated in the past decade such as chelators of calcium (EDTA), inhibition of nasal enzymes (boro-leucin, aprotinin), inhibition of muco-ciliar clearance (preservatives), solubilisation of nasal membrane (cyclodextrin, fatty acids, surfactants) and formation of micelles (surfactants). Many surfactants such as bile acids, Laureth 9 and taurodehydrofusidate (STDHF) turned out to be quite effective in enhancing nasal absorption, but caused local cytotoxic effects on ciliated cells.-Therefore, enhancers with an acceptable safety profile under chronic treatment are still to be discovered. A greater permeability of drug through nasal mucosa has the potential to overcome the limitations of oral route and to approach the benefits of intravenous infusion. Safe and efficacious enhancers will be necessary for commercially successful products.<br>
The delivery of biologically active materials to the skin and cell membranes by means of an aqueous vehicle that comprises the combination of lipid vesicles and water miscible organic solvents has been described in the art.<br>
For example, an aqueous carrier system containing phospholipids and ethanol was described in EP 158441, with the weight ratio between the aforementioned components being from 40:1 to 1:20.<br>
US 5,711,965 describes a solution comprising phospholipids, ethanol and water in a weight ratio of 10:16:74, respectively.<br>
US 5,540,934, US 5,716,638 and WO 03/000174 describe an aqueous composition containing vesicles (ethosomes) in the presence of ethanol.<br>
US 6,627,211 describes a carrier suitable for the administration of an anti-convulsive agent to the nasal mucous membranes. It appears that the content of organic solvents in said carrier is relatively high (30% to 60% ethanol and 30 to 60% propylene glycol).<br>
It has now been found that an aqueous composition which contains phospholipids in a concentration of 0.2 to 10% by weight, in combination with one or more short chain alcohols, wherein the weight concentration of water is not less than 30% by weight and the<br><br>
weight concentration of said alcohol(s) is in the range between 12 to 30% by weight, may be adapted for use as an intranasal drug delivery vehicle.<br>
Accordingly, in a first aspect, the present invention provides the use of phospholipid, one or more C2-C4 alcohols and water in the preparation of a vesicular composition adapted for intranasal administration of an active agent, wherein the concentrations of said phospholipid and said one or more alcohols in said composition are in the ranges of 0.2 to 10% and 12 to 30% by weight, respectively, and the water content of said composition is not less than 30% by weight.<br>
Preferably, the water content in the composition is not less than 35%, and more preferably not less than 45%. The weight ratio between the alcohol(s) and the phospholipids is not less than 2:1, and more preferably not less than 5:1.<br>
Phospholipids suitable for use in the preparation of the composition according to the present invention include phosphatidylcholine (PC), hydrogenated phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidic acid (PA), phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylglycefol (PPG) and phosphatidylinositol (PL). The chemical structure of phospholipids that may be used according to the present invention is described in US 4,614,730, which is incorporated herein by reference. Preferably, the phospholipids are present in the composition of the invention at a concentration of 0.5 to 5% by weight.<br>
The term C2-C4 alcohols, as used herein, refers to alkanols containing two, three or four carbon atoms. The alcohols to be used according to the present invention specifically include ethanol, 1-propanol, isopropyl alcohol and tert-buty\ alcohol, with the former being especially preferred. The concentration of ethanol in the composition contemplated by the present invention for use as an intranasal drug delivery vehicle is preferably in the range of 15 to 27% by weight.<br>
According to a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the composition further comprises one or more water miscible polyols, and especially glycols (1,2-diols, such as ethylene glycol and propylene glycol, with the latter being especially preferred), at a concentration of 1 to 30% by weight, and preferably 5 to 20 by weight.<br><br>
The compositions of the present invention may be prepared by mixing together the various components, namely, water, phospholipids, one or more C2-C4 alcohols (and possibly also one or more polyols) and the active ingredient under conditions that allow the formation of vesicles. More specifically, the compositions of the present invention may be conveniently prepared by dissolving the phospholipids in the alcohol (or in the alcohol/glycol mixture), followed by the addition of the active ingredient, either in the form of an aqueous solution thereof or in a solid form, with a subsequent addition of water. The preparation of the composition is preferably carried out under stirring, typically at room temperature or at an elevated temperature, which is preferably not higher than 50°C.<br>
Alternatively, a dispersion of the phospholipids and the active ingredient in water is prepared, into which the alcohol, optionally together with polyol (e.g., a mixture of ethanol and propylene glycol) are added with stirring, possibly under heating.<br>
It is also possible to first prepare freeze-dried lipid vesicles having the active ingredient encapsulated therein, and subsequently dispersing the same in a mixture of water, the C2-C4 alcohol and optionally polyol.<br>
As mentioned above, the combination of phospholipids, water, and the water-miscible organic solvents (namely, the alcohol and the polyol) according to the concentrations and weight ratios specified above allows the formation of a non-irritant, vesicular composition, with the vesicles present therein, whose size ranging between 50 nm to few microns, and more specifically, up to 5u,m, exhibiting good properties for enhanced nasal absorption. Figure 1 is TE (transmission electron) micrograph of a specific composition according to the present invention (containing insulin as the active agent; the exact composition is given in the Examples below - entry F in table 1A). It may be seen that in this specific system, the vesicular structures are multilamellar. The vesicles were visualized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy. TEM analysis was carried out using a Philips TEM CM 12 electron microscope (TEM, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) with an accelerating voltage of lOOkV.<br><br>
Thus, the present invention concerns methods for intranasal administration, and compositions for intranasal administration comprising vesicular systems formed from at least one active molecule, phospholipid, alcohol (C2-C4) and water. Optionally, the composition further comprises glycol (propylene glycol, transcutol, tetraglycol, etc).<br>
We have found that pharmaceutical formulations including the above ingredients could deliver therapeutic amounts of agents to the systemic circulation or the brain of mammals and have efficient therapeutic or prophylaxis effect. The invention can be used for pharmaceutical, cosmetic, medical, veterinary, diagnostic and research applications. The present invention includes nasally administering to the mammal a therapeutically effective amount of active ingredient by means of compositions described above. The nasal delivery may be either for local purposes (to the mucosa of the nose), for systemic administration through the circulation or for CNS administration for curing brain disease.<br>
It should be noted that the composition according to the present invention may include additional excipients that are well known in the art, such as surfactants, preservatives, thickening agents, co-solvents, adhesives, antioxidants, buffers, viscosity and absorption enhancing agents and agents capable of adjusting the pH and osmolarity of the formulation.<br>
Suitable surfactants that can be used in accordance with the present invention include ionic, nonionic or amphoteric surface active agents.

Span 20, Span 60, Myrj, Arlacel 83 and such) may be suitably used, preferably at a concentration in the range of 0-25% by weight.<br>
Suitable preservatives that can be used with the present formulations include, for example, benzyl alcohol, parabens, chlorobutanol, benzalkonium salts and combinations thereof. Some examples of antioxidants include tocopherols, butyl hydroxytoluene, sodium metabisulfite, potassium metabi sulfite, ascorbyl palmitate and the like. These preservatives and antioxidants may be present in the formulations in a concentration of from about 0.001% up to about 5%w/w.<br><br>
Regarding buffers, the nasal delivery system may include a buffer for maintaining the formulation at a pH of about 7.0. The particular buffer, of course, can vary depending upon the particular nasal delivery system used, as well as the specific active molecule selected. Buffers that are suitable for use in the present invention include, for example, acetate, citrate, prolamine, carbonate and phosphate buffers and combinations thereof. The pharmaceutical formulations of the present invention may include a pH adjusting agent.<br>

The compositions could be administered from nasal sprays, metered-dose sprays, squeeze bottles, liquid droppers, disposable one-dose droppers, nebulizers, cartridge systems with unit-dose ampoules, single-dose pumps, bi-dose pumps, multiple-dose pumps or any other device. For example, the compositions of the invention may be stored in/delivered from a spray or aerosol device/container as described in details in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (16th edition, Chapters 83 and 92).<br>
Regarding spray devices, it should be noted that both single (unit) dose or multiple dose systems may be used. Typically, a spray device comprises a bottle and a pump; such devices are commercially available from various sources. Typically, the volume of liquid that is dispensed in a single spray actuation is in the range of from 5 to 250 microlitters/each nostril/single administration and the concentration of the active ingredient in the formulation may be readily adjusted such that one or more spray into the nostrils will comply with the dosage regimen.<br>

Diazepam is 7-chloro-l,3-dihydro-l-methyl-5-phenyl-2H-l,4-benzo-diazepin-2-one. A method for the synthesis of diazepam has been described, for example by Sternbach LH, Reeder E, Keller O, &amp; Metlesics W. [Quinazolines and 1,4-benzodiazepines III substituted 2-amino-5-phenyl-3H-l,4-benzodiazepine 4-oxides. J Org Chem, 26: 4488-4497, 1961]. Diazepam is typically administered at a daily dose of 0.2 to 100 mg.<br>

Preferably, the composition further comprises a polyol, and more specifically, propylene glycol, at a concentration in the range of 1 to 30% by weight.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides a method for preventing and/or treating obesity in a mammal, which method comprises the intranasal administration of the aforementioned sibutramine-containing composition. Sibutramine is typically administered at a daily dose of 1 to 30 mg. Its preparation is described by Jeffery et al., [Synthesis of Sibutramine, A Novel Cyclobutylalkylamine Useful in the Treatment of Obesity and its Major Human Metabolites, J. Chem. Soc. Perkin. Trans. 1, 2583-2589 (1996)] and also in US Patent Nos. 4,746,680; 4,929,629; and 5,436,272.<br>

In another aspect, the present invention provides a method for treating multiple sclerosis in a mammal, which method comprises the intranasal administration of the aforementioned glatiramer-containing composition. Glatiramer is typically administered at a daily dose of 1 to 60 mg. Glatiramer acetate is a mixture of polypeptides composed of alanine, glutamic acid, lysine, and tyrosine in a molar ratio of approximately 4.6:1.5:3.6:1.0, respectively, which is synthesized by chemically polymerizing the four amino acids, forming products with average molecular weights ranging from about 4000 to about 13,000 daltons. The corresponding molar fractions are approximately 0.427 for alanine, 0.141 for glutamic acid, 0.337 for lysine and 0.093 for tyrosine, and may vary by about +/-10%.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides a method for treating depression and/or hot flushes in a mammal, which method comprises the intranasal administration of the aforementioned paroxetine-containing composition. Paroxetine is typically administered at a daily dose of 5 to 100 mg. Its preparation is described, for example, in US 6,956,121 and US 6,686,473.<br>
An especially important aspect of the present invention is related to the treatment of malaria. In malaria prevalent regions of the world, Plasmodium infections is the reason for a very high mortality rates (hundreds of thousands of deaths), especially among children. Many patients with acute malaria are unable to tolerate oral therapy and parenteral treatment, which could only be available at hospitals, is necessary. However, these amenities are usually inaccessible.<br>
It has now been found that anti-malaria drug administered intranasally is effective at least as or even more that i.p. administration. This finding paves the way to the formulation of a pharmaceutical composition for intra-nasal administration comprising a carrier and at least one anti-malaria agent.<br><br>
Examples of anti-malaria drugs are artemisinin derivatives, dihydroartemisinin, artemotil, chloroquine, primaquine, doxycillin, quinine, aminoquinolines, cinchona alkaloids, antifolates, quinidine, melfoquine, halofantrine, lumefantrine, amodiaquine, pyronaridine, tafenoquine, artesunates, artemether, artemotil, biguanides, proguanil, chloproguanil, diaminopyrimidines, pyremethamine, trimethoprim, dapsone, sulfonamides, atovaquone, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, N-acetyl cysteine, piperaquine, DHA-piperaquine, lumefantrine, dermaseptins, bisphosphonates, quercitin etc.<br>
The present invention is thus also concerned with a pharmaceutical composition for intra-nasal administration comprising a carrier and at least one anti-malaria drug, wherein said carrier is most preferably a vesicular carrier (namely, a carrier that contain vesicles suspended therein), and also with the use of an anti-malaria agent in the preparation of a medicament for intra-nasally treating malaria.<br>
The intranasal composition may comprise any carrier or combination of carriers known to be suitable for intranasal administration. Preferably, however, the composition in accordance with this aspect of the invention comprises at least one anti malaria agent in combination with the intranasal drug delivery vehicle as described above, which vehicle comprises not less than 30% by weight water, from 12 to 30% by weight C2-C4 alcohol(s), from 1 to 30% by weight water-miscible polyol(s), from 0.2 to 10% phospholipids arranged in a vesicular structure. Other preferred features of the anti-malaria composition are as described above in connection with said intranasal drug delivery vehicle.<br>
By another aspect the present invention provides a method for treating malaria (including cerebral malaria) comprising: administering intra-nasally to a subject in need of such treatment a therapeutically effective amount of at least one anti-malaria drug. Preferably, the anti-malaria drug is dihydroartemisinin, which is typically administered at the following dosage regimen:<br>
Adults: 40-120mg/day in divided doses for 6-7 days; Children: 2-4 mg/kg in a divided loading dose on the first day followed by 1-2 mg/kg daily for 6 days. Dihydroartemisinin can be prepared by reduction of artemisinin with sodium borohydride; [A. Brossi et al.,<br><br>

Example 12 Treatment and prophylaxis of malaria by intranasal administration of dihydroartemisinin<br>
(DHA)<br>
Table II details compositions of dihydroartemisinin, which were prepared according to the procedure described in Example 7 above.<br><br>
The compositions described in Table II were tested as follows.<br>
Experiments were carried out in vivo in ICR female mice infected with 106 erythrocytes parasitized Plasmodium berghei anka, a model of cerebral malaria with striking similarities to the human disease. Infections were monitored using giemsa-stained thin blood smears prepared from tail blood. The animals were treated under isoflurane anesthesia with lOmg DHA/kg/day in a two divided daily doses by two dosage regimens: prophylaxis regimen- starting at 2 days before the infection for a total of 6 days; treatment regimen- starting on day 2 after infection (parasitemia first detected) for a total of 4 days. Mice were either treated by the intranasal administration or by the i.p. injection containing the same DHA doses. Controls included placebo (delivery carrier only) and untreated infected animals. Experiments were conducted in accordance with institutional guidelines for animal care.<br>
Results show that parasites were not detected in the prophylaxis regimen animal group treated with intranasal administration of DHA in the enhancing permeation carrier, but appeared in 74% of mice treated in the same regimen by i.p. DHA injection. In the<br><br>
treatment regimen, 75% of mice which received intranasal DHA survived, in comparison with only 19% in the i.p. treatment group. Isoflurane anesthesia and the administration of the placebo carrier did not affect the development of the disease. All mice in the control groups succumbed to the parasitemia.<br>
In conclusion, it has been shown that DHA intranasal administration from an enhancing permeation carrier, was effective for prophylaxis and treatment of anemic and cerebral malaria in mice.<br>
Example 13 Intranasal administration of diazepam<br>
The efficacy of the intranasal administration of the diazepam-containing composition prepared according to Example 8 was tested by means of the following experiments.<br>
Experiment 1: The experiments were carried out on Female Balb/c mice (21-26g). Two experimental groups were used: control (untreated) (n=6) and treated group (n=6). The animals in active treatment group were administered with the Diazepam intranasal Phospholipid ethanolic vesicular compositions 2.9(4.1 in each nose (5mg/kg animal). Half an hour after nasal application, each animal in treated and control groups was IP administered with acetic acid 0.6% (10 ml/kg) and individually housed in cage with a smooth flat floor. Antinociception effect was recorded by counting the number of writhes 5 minutes after injection of acetic acid for period of 10 minutes. A writhe is indicated by abdominal constriction and stretching of at least one hind limb.<br>
Figure 6 is a bar diagram illustrating the results obtained, which show that intranasal administration of diazepam from the vesicular composition, 0.5 h before acetic acid injection efficiently prevented writhing episodes.<br>
Experiment 2: The experiment was carried out on Female Balb/c mice (21—26g). Two experimental groups were used: control (untreated) (n=6) and treated group (n=6). The animals in active treatment group were administered with the Diazepam intranasal vesicular composition 2.9ul in each nose (5mg/kg animal). Immediately after nasal application (r=0), each animal in treated and control groups was IP administered with<br><br>
acetic acid 0.6% (10 ml/kg) and individually housed in cage with a smooth flat floor. Antinociception was recorded by counting the number of writhes 5 minutes after injection of acetic acid for period of 10 minutes.<br>
Figure 7 is a bar diagram illustrating the results obtained, which show that intranasal administration of diazepam from the vesicular composition simultaneously with injection of acetic acid solution was efficient in treating writhing episodes.<br>
Experiment 3: The experiments were carried out on Female Balb/c mice (21—26g). Three experimental groups were used: control (untreated) (n=4), mice intranasally administered with the Diazepam IN vesicular composition (2.8ul in each nostril = diazepam dose of 5mg/kg animal) (n=4) and mice subcutaneously administered with the Diazepam solution 0.125 % at dose of 5mg/kg animal (n=4). The animals in active treatment groups were administered with the Diazepam intranasal composition and subcutaneous diazepam. Simultaneously, each animal in treated and control groups was IP administered with acetic acid 0.6% (10 ml/kg) and individually housed in cage with a smooth flat floor. Antinociception was recorded by counting the number of writhes 5 minutes after injection of acetic acid for period of 10 minutes.<br>
Figure 8 is a bar diagram illustrating the results obtained, which show that intranasal administration of diazepam from the vesicular composition, was significantly more efficient in treating writhing episodes as compared to the same dose of the drug administered subcutaneously.<br>
Example 14 Intranasal administration of granisetron HC1<br>
Table III details compositions of granisetron, which were prepared according to the procedures described in Examples 9-10 above.<br><br><br>
The compositions detailed in Table III were used for the intranasal administration of granisetron hydrochloride to rats and the pharmacodynamic response thereof was evaluated as follows.<br>
Experiments were carried out on Male SD/H rats weighing 200-240 g. The animals were housed individually in cages (23x23x20 cm) in a room with a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle (lights on between 06:00 and 18:00 h) at a constant temperature (27±1 °C) and humidity (50±5%). Pelleted food and water was available ad libitum. Each cage had a wire-mesh floor to permit collection of spilt kaolin and food. Kaolin pellets were prepared according to the methods described Takeda et al. (1993). .Briefly, gum Arabic and hydrated aluminum silicate (kaolin- China clay) were mixed together (1:100 on a weight: weight basis) with distilled water to form a thick paste. Pellets of the resulting kaolin mixture<br><br>
were shaped to resemble the dimensions of the rats' normal laboratory diet. The pellets were dried completely at room temperature.<br>
The kaolin pellets were introduced into the cages 3 days prior to drug administration. They were held in identical stainless-steel containers (7*8x3 cm, attached to the side of the cage) to the food pellets. The kaolin and food containers were removed each day (at 10:00 h) and the spilt kaolin and food collected, to determine the rats' consumption, during each 24-h period, up to a total 72 h observation time. Rat weight was also recorded on a daily basis.<br>
Ipecac syrup 5ml/kg was administrated orally and animals returned to the experiment cages. Rats were administrated with intranasal Granisetron HC1 Composition B (at a dose of 1.5mg granisetron HCl/kg rat). One hour after- intranasal administration of granisetron, Ipecac syrup was given orally using a gavage to treated (n=5) and untreated (control, n=5) animals. Immediately after Ipecac syrup, .the animals in the treatment group were administered with an additional dose of intranasal Granisetron hydrochloride followed by drug intranasal administration at regular 12-h intervals for additional 2.5 days. Kaolin and food intake as well as rat weights were measured at 24, 48 and 72 h post- Ipecac.<br>
The results collected are represented in Figures 9 to 11. The Results show that intranasal administration of granisetron HC1 from composition B, was efficient in preventing weight loss (Fig. 9), stimulating food consumption (Fig. 10) and preventing kaolin consumption (Fig. 11) in rats with Pica syndrome (equivalent to emesis and vomiting in humans).<br>
Example 15 Transport of fluorescent probe across nasal mucosa following in vivo administration<br>
Visualization of Rhodamine B (hydrophilic probe, MW 479) permeation across the nasal mucosa using the composition of the invention (containing 0.05% (0.5mg/mL) Rhodamine B) was carried out as follows.<br>
A stock solution of Rhodamine B (2mg/mL) was prepared in water. 50mg of phospholipid were dissolved in 200 mg ethanol. To this solution 100 mg propylene glycol and 10 mg<br><br>
Labrasol were added and mixed. To the obtained mixture 250 microliter of the aforementioned aqueous Rhodamine B solution (2mg/ml) were added slowly with constant stirring. The residual 390 microlitter of DDW were added slowly to the obtained system with constant vortexing. The composition is stirred for additional 5 min. The composition is described in Table IV.<br><br>
The composition was applied intranasally to the right nostril of SD/H male 220-250g rats (application volume lOOuL) anesthetized i.p. with Ketamine-Xylazine mixture.<br>
The animals were sacrificed 1/2 hour from the application and the nasal septum with the adjunct epithelial membrane from each animal were carefully removed from the bone. The harvested septum was fixed with 3.8% Formalin in PBS (pH 7.4) for 1 hour in room temperature. The untreated epithelia on the left side of the septum were separated from the septum. The septum with right side epithelia was placed on the slide, covered with cover glass, fixed with tape and observed under CLS microscope (10-40X/0.6 plan Neofluor lens, Zeiss LSM 410 confocal system with an Axiovert 135 inverted microscope).<br>

In another container 0.2g of Phospholipin 90 were dissolved in 2g EtOH to this solution lg of propylene glycol and 0.02g of Vitamin E were added and mixed to obtain clear system in Heidolph mixer (700rpm). The obtained system was stirred for additional 5 min and added slowly to the gel phase under constant mixing at 400rpm. To the obtained semi¬solid preparation 3.9mL of insulin aqueous solution containing 250 IU/mL (prepared from dissolving 40.6mg of human insulin powder containing 24IU/mg (Sigma) in DDW) was added. The obtained composition was mixed for additional 5 min. It is notable that insulin solution could be added in each stage of the preparation. The final semi-solid composition contains 97.5IU insulin/ g.<br><br><br>
Experimental protocol:<br>
Nasa! absorption experiments with insulin compositions I, II (control composition containing 10% EtOH) and III (control liposomal composition containing 2% EtOH) were performed in ICR/male mice (7-10Weeks) obtained from (Harlan/Israel). The animals were fasted 1 h prior to an insulin administration and during the experiment time, with free access to water. Compositions were intranasally administered to the animals (12.5ul in each nostril, a total of 25 ul per animal- each nose side), using a pipette with a disposable plastic tip. The nasal insulin formulations were administered at time=0h following a short isofluran anesthesia. The total amount of insulin delivered nasally to each animal, was 1.575 IU. Blood glucose levels were measured by glucose oxidase method using Glucometer Elite (disposable strips). The measurements were performed starting from one hour prior to intranasal administration of Compositions up to 6 hours from the administration.<br>
The results presented in Figure 13 show that Composition I efficiently reduced blood glucose levels, while administration of Compositions II and III (controls) had no effect on BGL.<br><br><br>
