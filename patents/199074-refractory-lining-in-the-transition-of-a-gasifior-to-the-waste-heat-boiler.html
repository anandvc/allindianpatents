				<td>The present invention pertains to a refractory lining in the transition section of a gasifies to the waste heat boiler with brackets for fastening refractory shaped bricks.<br>
Hot synthesis gas flows through the transition from the gasifier to the waste heat boiler, and this transition is also exposed to hot slag. The temperatures in this transition section are above 1,400°C<br>
An unprotected material consisting of steel is not resistant at these high<br><br>
• temperatures and to the additional gas/solids flows. This area is therefore lined wit; a refractory material. It is possible to select between tamping clays, refractory shape( bricks, or a combination of these two materials, but the shaped blocks offer a bette quality of material.<br>
The transition between the reaction vessel and the synthesis gas cooler is lined with a refractory lining consisting of shaped bricks in a reaction vessel with a downstream waste heat boiler of a synthesis gas cooler, which was delivered by the applicant for the Ruhr synthesis gas plant (SAR) of Ruhrchemie in Oberhausen-Holten.<br>
The upper shaped bricks are placed in an annular pattern on cast brackets, which are festened one on top of another at the pipe end of the gasifier and at the pipe end of the synthesis gas cooler. The shaped bricks in the area of the cooling tube bundle are placed on circumferential tube noses at the transition fiom the vertical cooling tubes into the horizontal cooling tube wall.<br>
Due to the refractory shaped bricks being supported by or lying on the circumferential noses of the cooling tube bundle, as well as due to a fixed point at the end of the gasifier pipe branch without additional expansion joints and elastic intermediate materials, the thermal stresses caused by high temperatures and the resulting movements of the refractory material are directly transmitted to the water¬side high-pressure parts, e.g., the tubes of the cooling tube bundle; the entire own weight of the bricks also loads the supports.   Furthermore, the upper fixed points<br><br>
(brackets) at the transition between the two vessels are not cooled and are exposed t( increasing overheating as the wear of the refractory material progresses.<br>
SUMMARY AND OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION The object of the present invention is therefore to design the refractory lining in the transition section between the reactor and the synthesis gas cooler such that the stresses in the refractory material are reduced, the weight of the bricks themselves is distributed on different supports, the relative movements between refractoi-y bricks and the brackets are compensated, abrupt cross section transitions are eliminated, the brackets are not fastened to water-cariying components (boiler tubes), and the so-called main claw is protected from overheating by an auxiliary cooling system.<br>
According to the invention, a refractory lining structure is provided in the transition section of a gasifier to the waste heat boiler. The lining structure includes brackets for fastening refractory shaped bricks. caws are suspended on hooks and are placed at an inlet pipe branch of the waste heat boiler. The cooling coil tubes are arranged in a sealing box underneath the claws. The brackets are fastened at spaced locations one on top of another in a cooling tube bundle. The refractory bricks placed in layers one on top of another are placed on the claws and the brackets.<br>
According to the present invention, the refractory area consists of three different layers of bricks arranged next to each other in the uncooled pipe branch as well as of different special shaped bricks, shaped shoulder bricks, and straight bricks, which are adapted to the temperature, wear, internal and external pressure conditions,<br><br>
as well as to the service life.<br>
The refractory brick lining is supported at the pipe branch and at the cooling tube bundle of the synthesis gas cooler by a brick«holding system. The holding system comprises brackets arranged one on top of another. These brackets are fastened at the webs of the tube-web-tube welding in the area of the cooling tube bundle and are -suspended on claws in the area of the pipe branch and are additionally cooled there. The following requirements are met, among other things, by these measures according to the present invention;<br>
the supports for the refractory bricks are distributed in different planes in order<br>
to distribute the weight of the bricks and thus to keep local stresses low,<br>
the compensation of the relative movements between the refractory bricks and<br>
the bracket structure is guaranteed by the use of an elastic ceramic material,<br>
abrupt cross section transitions in the transition are eliminated,<br>
the brick brackets are welded to the webs between the water-side high-pressure<br>
parts (boiler tubes),<br>
the main claw is protected from overheating by building in an auxiliary heating,<br>
the brick sizes and the design of the bricks are selected such that stresses in the<br>
bricks remain low,<br>
a drip nose is fashioned at the lower outlet of the cooling tube bundles in order<br>
to prevent slag from creeping along the horizontal wall and from clogging the<br>
tube bundle.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a refractory lining in a transition section of a gasifier to the waste heat boiler, the waste heat boiler having an inlet pipe branch and an upper part with a cooling tube bundle, the lining comprising brackets for fastening refractory shaped bricks, said brackets being fastened at spaced locations one on top of another to the cooling tube bundle: connection hooks connected to the inlet pipe branch of the waste heat boiler; claws suspended on said hooks; a sealing box disposed underneath said claws cooling coil tubes arranged in said sealing box: and refractory bricks placed in layers one on top of another disposed on said claws and said brackets.<br><br>
