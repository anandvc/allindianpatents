Description<br>
Magnetic drive system for a switching device<br>
The invention relates to a magnetic drive system for a<br>
switching device of the type specified in the precharacterizing<br>
clause of patent claim 1.<br>
A bipolar drive system such as this is already known, for<br>
example, from DE 197 09 089 A1. The armature in this case is<br>
composed of a solid magnetic iron material which allows it to<br>
be manufactured at a lower cost than an armature composed of<br>
layers of electrical laminates, and
longer long-term stability. In this context, the solid armature<br>
has the intrinsic disadvantage that, in comparison to armatures<br>
composed of layers of electrical laminates, more eddy current<br>
losses occur and the remanence is greater which, inter alia,<br>
makes it more difficult to release the switching contacts<br>
during switching processes. In order to reduce the eddy current<br>
losses, the armature is provided with elongated hollow channels<br>
which comprise narrow slots and extend in the forward-movement<br>
direction of the armature, and therefore in the direction of<br>
the magnetic lines of force. The slots which are provided on<br>
the narrow faces of the armature weaken the cuboid armature in<br>
this case over one-third of its cross-sectional width in each<br>
case, and over its entire length. Furthermore, a plurality of<br>
parallel slots are cut out alongside one another from the broad<br>
faces of the armature and do not extend over the entire length<br>
of the armature, but end at a distance from the end faces of<br>
the armature. However, the slots have a considerable adverse<br>
effect on the mechanical robustness of the armature overall.<br>
Provision is therefore made for the robustness of the armature<br>
to be further increased after introduction of the slots, by<br>
filling the slots with insulating material. However, in<br>
particular because these slots should be as narrow as possible,<br>
for technical reasons,<br><br>
the filling of the slots is technically correspondingly<br>
difficult and considerably increases the armature production<br>
costs.<br>
In order to counter the greater remanence of the armature, it<br>
should be possible to adapt the junctions between the contact<br>
surface of the armature and the yoke laminates as required.<br>
Reducing the contact area admittedly leads to a better response<br>
in the sense of a shorter switching time, but this must be<br>
obtained at the: expense of the disadvantage of a reduced<br>
armature holding force. Since, however, an excessively low<br>
armature holding force has a disadvantageous effect on the<br>
operational reliability of the magnetic drive system, the known<br>
drive system cannot comply with the design requirements for<br>
many applications.<br>
The invention is therefore based on the object of further<br>
developing a magnetic drive system of the type specified in the<br>
precharacterizing clause of claim 1 in such a way that the<br>
robustness of the armature is not excessively reduced by its<br>
design to reduce the eddy current losses.<br>
This object is achieved by the features of patent claim 1.<br>
Advantageous refinements of the invention are the subject<br>
matter of the dependent claims.<br>
The magnetic drive system according to the invention for a<br>
switching device has a magnet yoke in which a solid armature<br>
composed of magnetic material is guided such that it can move<br>
linearly between two opposite limit positions, and at least one<br>
permanent magnet for production of a magnetic flux in the<br>
magnet yoke, and at least one coil, by means of which the<br>
armature can be moved backward and forward between its limit<br>
positions, wherein the armature is provided with elongated<br>
channels<br><br>
in order to prevent eddy current losses, and the channels in<br>
the armature are closed all the way round on their<br>
circumference.<br>
The arrangement of channels (hollow channels) which are closed<br>
all the way round in the armature results in a simple manner in<br>
the robustness of the armature being scarcely adversely<br>
affected. This avoids the need for the technically complex<br>
filling of the channels.<br>
The channels which are incorporated in the armature preferably<br>
comprise holes with a relatively small hollow cross section.<br>
Holes such as these need not necessarily be circular but may<br>
also, for example, have an oval cross section. However, as far<br>
as possible, the hollow cross section should be configured such<br>
that there are no sharp corners on the circumferential wall<br>
which bounds the hollow cross section.<br>
However, when holes are introduced retrospectively into the<br>
armature block, it is advantageous for the holes to be circular<br>
because they can then be produced at low cost by means of<br>
drills.<br>
With respect to both the technical effect and from the<br>
production engineering point of view as well, it is<br>
advantageous for the holes in the armature actually to be<br>
through-holes. Alternatively, the holes may be in the form of<br>
blind holes, which are drilled from both side surfaces.<br>
The technical effect of a gap in terms of reducing the eddy<br>
current losses can be achieved approximately by arranging a<br>
plurality of channels in a row in the armature a short distance<br>
apart to form a row of bore holes or a plurality of rows of<br>
holes. In this case, a plurality of rows of holes are<br>
expediently each aligned parallel to one another along a<br>
straight line.<br><br>
It is particularly effective for those end faces of the<br>
armature block through which the armature guide rods pass to be<br>
connected via at least one row of holes or a plurality of<br>
parallel rows of holes, in particular two, three or four rows<br>
of holes, with these holes being through-holes which run<br>
parallel to the broad faces of the armature close to the hole<br>
for the armature guide rod. At least one further row of holes<br>
or a plurality of rows of holes, in particular two, three or<br>
four rows of holes, can be provided centrally between these<br>
rows of holes, extending along the center longitudinal plane of<br>
the armature, between its narrow faces.<br>
A further technical improvement is achieved if the broad faces<br>
of the armature block are also perforated by a plurality of<br>
rows, largely of through-holes. In this case, two arrays of<br>
rows of holes can be arranged next to the lateral plane of the<br>
armature guide rod. If two armature guide rods are mounted in<br>
opposite blind holes in the armature, then an armature area<br>
which remains between the blind hole ends and is composed of<br>
solid material can additionally still be used for central<br>
arrangement of one through-hole.<br>
The armature block, through which holes pass in all three<br>
spatial directions, ensures not only that the eddy current<br>
losses are reduced but also a considerable reduction in the<br>
remanence tendency. The remanence is reduced to an even greater<br>
extent if the opposing surfaces which interact with the stop<br>
surfaces of the armature are also each perforated by one row of<br>
holes, or in each case a plurality of rows of holes.<br>
Overall, in comparison to the known system with slots as hollow<br>
channels, the magnet system has the advantage that the<br>
formation of eddy currents is impeded in all three axis<br>
directions, and<br><br>
is thus reduced. In this case, the operational reliability is<br>
maintained virtually without any restriction, since the holding<br>
force for the same total induction is reduced only<br>
insignificantly, and the remanent induction of the magnet<br>
circuit decreases at the same time.<br>
The latter effect is essentially because the magnetic induction<br>
in the armature is only locally specifically increased into the<br>
saturation range, and the local permeability is thus reduced.<br>
Furthermore, the armature mass is reduced because of the<br>
numerous channels in the armature, thus resulting overall in<br>
less remanence associated with better dynamic characteristics<br>
of the armature and of the overall magnet system.<br>
Further expedient, refinements and advantages of the invention<br>
will become evident from the following description of one<br>
exemplary embodiment and with reference to the figures of the<br>
drawing, in wh;.ch mutually corresponding components are<br>
provided with the same reference symbols, and in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a perspective oblique view of a supporting<br>
structure for a magnetic drive system,<br>
Figure 2 shows a perspective individual view, obliquely from<br>
the left, of an armature of the supporting structure,<br>
Figure 3 shows a perspective individual view, obliquely from<br>
the right, of the armature of the supporting<br>
structure.<br>
Figure 4 shows a front view of a narrow face of the separate<br>
armature block,<br><br>
Figure 5 shows a front view of one broad face of the separate<br>
armature block.<br>
Figure 6 shows a section through the armature block along the<br>
section line VI-VI in Figure 5, and<br>
Figure 7 shows a front view of one end face of the separate<br>
armature block.<br>
Figure 1 shows a supporting structure 1 of a permanent-magnet<br>
drive system, which is not illustrated in its totality, for the<br>
operation of a switching device. This structure 1 has a cuboid<br>
frame which comprises two magnet yokes 2 and 3 with two<br>
mounting plates 4 and 5 between them. The two magnet yokes 2<br>
and 3 have mirror-image symmetry and, at each of the two ends,<br>
have yoke limbs which are angled through 90° thus creating an<br>
approximately U-shaped basic shape. The planar end surfaces of<br>
the yoke limbs of the magnet yokes 2 and 3 which face one<br>
another rest flat at the top on the facing side surface of the<br>
mounting plate 4 and at the bottom on the facing side surface<br>
of the mounting plate 5, with the corresponding yoke limbs<br>
being connected to one another via the mounting plates 4 and 5.<br>
A protruding pole limb projects from the central area between<br>
the yoke limbs from each of the magnet yokes 2 and 3, with the<br>
mutually opposite pole limbs facing one another, corresponding<br>
to the yoke limbs. Permanent magnets 6 and 7 in the form of<br>
plates are attached to the ends of the pole limbs which are<br>
opposite one another with a distance between them.<br>
A cuboid armature 8 is located in the yoke frame between the<br>
plane-parallel permanent magnets 6 and 7 and at a short<br>
distance from them and, in the illustrated position, rests on<br>
the<br><br>
mounting plate 5. The armature 8 also has two armature guide rods<br>
9 which project centrally from the upper face and the lower face,<br>
respectively, of the armature block and are arranged geometrically<br>
coaxially with respect to one another. The armature guide rods 9<br>
pass through a bearing hole 10 in the respective mounting plate 4<br>
or 5 associated with them, with little circumferential play, and<br>
an end area of them projects out of the bearing hole 10 in their<br>
mounting plate 4 or 5, as a result of which the armature 8 can be<br>
moved linearly in the vertical direction by means of the guide<br>
rods 9. In conjunction with the pole limbs and the yoke limbs, the<br>
yoke frame would also be provided with two coils, whose magnetic<br>
field would move the armature 8 to its upper limit position, with<br>
an appropriate polarity direction, after overcoming its adhesion<br>
to the mounting plate 5, in which upper limit position its forward<br>
movement would be limited by impacting on the lower face of the<br>
mounting plate 4. After reversal of the polarity direction of the<br>
magnetic field, it will once again be forced down, after<br>
overcoming the adhesion by magnetic forces, to the illustrated<br>
limit position onto the mounting plate 5, and will be held in the<br>
contact position. The method of operation of magnet drives such as<br>
these is known per se, and will therefore not be described any<br>
further here.<br>
In this case, the magnet yokes 2 and 3 comprise a multiplicity of<br>
thin yoke laminates which are joined to form the illustrated,<br>
thick yoke laminate stack. In contrast, the armature 8 and the<br>
mounting plates 4 and 5 are composed of blocks of ferromagnetic<br>
material of a known type, in particular of an appropriate iron<br>
alloy.<br>
In order to reduce the eddy current losses and the remenance of<br>
the armature 8 and of the mounting plates 4 and 5, a multiplicity<br>
of channels (hollow channels) 11, 12 and 13 are integrated in the<br>
solid block of the armature 8 and in this case have a<br>
corresponding diameter of 2 mm to 3 mm, with them all being in the<br><br>
form of through-holes and differing only in terms of their<br>
length, since they pass through the block of the armature 8 in<br>
different directions. Alternatively, the channels 11, 12 and 13<br>
may also be in the form of blind holes, which are drilled from<br>
both side surfaces.<br>
As can be seen more clearly in conjunction with Figures 2 and<br>
3, the channels 11 originate from the upper end face of the<br>
armature 8, run parallel to the central longitudinal axis of<br>
the armature guide rods 9 and therefore at right angles to the<br>
planar end face until they open on the opposite end face. In<br>
this case, there are two rows, each having six channels 11,<br>
with the
separated by a distance of about 4 mm from the adjacent channel<br>
11. These rows run parallel to the long side edges of the end<br>
faces and on opposite sides of a blind hole 14 which is<br>
arranged centrally on the end face and has an internal thread<br>
into which the armature guide rod 9 is screwed. The channels 12<br>
are arranged transversely with respect to these channels 11,<br>
originate from a narrow face of the armature 8 and open on the<br>
opposite narrow face of the armature 8. This total of five<br>
channels 12 forms a straight row which is arranged centrally<br>
between the long side edges of the narrow face, as can be seen<br>
without any doubt, in conjunction with Figure 4. However, these<br>
channels 12 therefore also run centrally between the two rows<br>
with the channels 11 and also pass through the plane on which<br>
the armature guide rods 9 are arranged. If the aim is to avoid<br>
any weakening of the hole wall of the blind holes 14, the<br>
channels 12 can therefore alternatively also be in the form of<br>
blind holes and can end at a distance before the blind hole 14.<br>
Blind holes such as these as channels 12 should then as far as<br>
possible end at the same distance from the blind hole 14 as the<br>
lateral distance between the channels<br><br>
11 on the end face of the armature 8. This distance can be seen<br>
well in the front plan view shown in figure 7. However, in this<br>
case, the channels 12 would have to be drilled from the<br>
opposite end faces, which would result in corresponding<br>
additional effort for production of the armature 8.<br>
The channels 13 are likewise introduced transversely with<br>
respect to the channels 11, but with a considerably greater<br>
number of them, and they all extend at right angles to the<br>
longitudinal center plane of the armature 8. In this case, the<br>
channels 13 originate from one broad face of the armature 8 and<br>
open into the opposite broad face. The hole pattern on the<br>
broad face in this case 'comprises two rectangular hole arrays<br>
which comprise three parallel rows of six hollow channels 13<br>
each, with the hollow channels 13 in the row and at the side<br>
being at a corresponding distance from one another. These hole<br>
arrays are located on both sides of a central area of the<br>
armature 8, in which the armature guide rods 9 are arranged.<br>
An individual channel 13' is additionally arranged centrally<br>
between the two hole arrays composed of hollow channels 13, and<br>
likewise forms a through-hole connecting the broad faces. As<br>
can be seen from the front view shown in figure 5 in<br>
conjunction with the sectional illustration shown in figure 6,<br>
the hollow channel 13' in this case passes through a solid<br>
material area of the armature block which remains between the<br>
ends of the two blind holes 14. The channel 13' therefore only<br>
insignificantly affects the robustness of the armature 8.<br>
In addition to the channels in the armature 8, channels 15 are<br>
also located in the mounting plates 4 and 5, and extend<br>
parallel to the axes of the channels 11. Of the channels<br>
(hollow channels) 15, there are two rows of six channels 15<br>
each, which<br><br>
are preferably arranged congruent to the channels 11 in the<br>
armature 8.<br><br>
