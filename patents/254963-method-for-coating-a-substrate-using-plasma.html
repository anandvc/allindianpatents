				<td>METHOD FOR COATING A SUBSTRATE USING PLASMA<br>
[0001] The present application describes a deposition process for coating substrates with<br>
a free-radical polymerised polymeric coating utilizing a combination of plasma technology<br>
and catalytically active initiators. The addition of a catalytic agent to the free-radical<br>
polymerisable monomers increases the deposition rate. Surprisingly the initiator also<br>
increases the degree to which the functionality of the monomer is retained within a plasma<br>
polymerised coating subsequent to polymerisation.<br>
[0002] Plasma, which is sometimes referred to as the fourth state of matter, is an at least<br>
partially ionised gaseous medium, made of excited, unstable and ionised atoms and<br>
molecules which emit visible and UV radiation. When matter is continually supplied with<br>
energy, its temperature increases and it typically transforms from a solid to a liquid and, then,<br>
to a gaseous state. Continuing to supply energy causes the matter to undergo a yet further<br>
change of state in which neutral atoms or molecules of the gas are broken up by energetic<br>
collisions to produce negatively charged electrons and positive or negatively charged ions.<br>
Other species generated in a plasma include high energy non-charged particles such as gas<br>
molecules in excited states, metastable compounds, molecular fragments and or radicals.<br>
The plasma is electrically neutral and therefore contains positive ions, negative ions and<br>
electrons in amounts such that the algebraic sum of their charges is zero. A plasma phase<br>
is obtained in the laboratory by subjecting a pure gas or a gaseous mixture to external<br>
excitation, which is most generally electrical.<br>
[0003] The term "plasma" covers a wide range of systems whose density and temperature<br>
vary by many orders of magnitude. Some plasmas, commonly known as thermal equilibrium<br>
plasmas are very hot and all their microscopic species (ions, electrons, etc.) are in<br>
approximate thermal equilibrium, the energy input into the system being widely distributed<br>
through atomic/molecular level collisions; examples include flame based plasmas. Flame<br>
based plasmas operate at high gas temperature and are oxidative by nature which means they<br>
have significant limitations when applied to deposition processes. In such high temperature<br>
gases it is impossible to maintain the chemical structure and/or functionality of the precursor in<br>
the deposited coatings. Furthermore, the high process temperatures involved are<br>
incompatible with heat sensitive substrates<br><br>
[0004] Other plasmas, however, particularly those at low pressure (e.g.100 Pa) where<br>
collisions are relatively infrequent, have their constituent species at widely different<br>
temperatures and are called "non-thermal equilibrium" plasmas. In non-thermal equilibrium<br>
plasmas, free electrons are very hot with temperatures of many thousands of Kelvin (K)<br>
whilst neutral and ionic species remain cool. Because the free electrons have almost<br>
negligible mass, the total system heat content is low and the plasma operates close to room<br>
temperature thus allowing the processing of temperature sensitive materials, such as<br>
plastics or polymers, without imposing a damaging thermal burden. The hot electrons<br>
create, through high energy collisions, a rich source of radicals and excited and/or unstable<br>
species with a high chemical potential energy capable of profound chemical and physical<br>
reactivity. It is this combination of low temperature operation plus high reactivity which<br>
makes non-thermal equilibrium plasma technologically important and a very powerful tool for<br>
manufacturing and material processing as it is capable of achieving processes which, if<br>
achievable at all without plasma, would require very high temperatures or noxious and<br>
aggressive chemicals.<br>
[0005] The use of plasma polymerisation is well established. Typically, the substrate to be<br>
coated is placed within a vessel, and a plasma is formed. Introducing a monomer into this<br>
plasma will then give rise to a plasma polymerisation reaction and lead to the deposition of a<br>
polymer onto the substrate. Many examples of such treatment are known in the art; for<br>
example, US 5,876,753 discloses a process for attaching target materials to a solid surface<br>
which process includes affixing carbonaceous compounds to a surface by low power<br>
variable duty cycle pulsed plasma deposition, and EP 0896035 discloses a device having a<br>
substrate and a coating, wherein the coating is applied to the substrate by plasma<br>
polymerisation of a gas comprising at least one organic compound or monomer. Similarly,<br>
WO 00/20130 describes a process for depositing a hydrophobic coating onto a solid<br>
substrate by exposing the substrate to a plasma containing a suitably substituted alkyne.<br>
EP 0095974 describes a process for the polymerisation of pre-prepared supported film<br>
which have been applied onto a substrate surface prior to the application of a plasma in a<br>
vacuum. Radical initiators may be used in the pre-prepared film as sensitizers. Similarly<br>
WO 2003/089479 describes a process in which a composition including both a free-radical<br>
polymerisable compound and a photoiatent compound, which may be a free-radical<br>
photoinitiator, is applied in a liquid form onto a three-dimensional substrate surface and is<br>
subsequently plasma treated in a vacuum chamber. Charles W. Paul, Alexis T. Bell and<br>
David S. Soong, Macromolecules 1985, 18, 2312 - 2318, discuss the initiation of methyl<br><br>
methacrylate polymerisation with a free-radical initiator. The free-radical initiator is<br>
produced in a vacuum glow discharge process.<br>
[0006] Yasuda, H. Plasma Polymerisation; Academic Press: Orlando, 1985 describes<br>
how vacuum glow discharge has been used to polymerise gas phase polymer precursors<br>
into continuous films. As an example, the plasma enhanced surface treatment and<br>
deposition of fluorocarbons has been investigated for the preparation of oleophobic surfaces<br>
since the 1970's. Initially, simple fluorocarbon gas precursors such as carbon tetrafluoride<br>
were used; this improved hydrophobicity but did not significantly improve oleophobicity.<br>
Subsequently, as described in EP 0049884 higher molecular weight fluorinated precursors such as the perfluoroalkyl substituted acrylates were used.<br>
[0007] These early processes typically resulted in fragmentation of the precursor and<br>
insertion of fluorine into the surface rather than formation of a polymerised fluorocarbon<br>
coating. The development of pulsed plasma polymerisation (or modulated discharge) as<br>
described in Ryan, M., Hynes, A., Badyal, J., Chem. Mater. 1996, 8(1), 37-42 and Chen, X.,<br>
Rajeshwar, K., Timmons, R., Chen, J., Chyan, O., Chem. Mater. 1996, 8(5), 1067-77<br>
produced polymerised coatings in which the properties and/or functionalities of the monomer<br>
are substantially retained resulting in the production of a polymeric coating retaining many<br>
properties of the precursor monomer. Coulson S.R., Woodward I.S., Badyal J.P.S., Brewer<br>
S.A., Willis C, Langmuir, 16, 6287-6293, (2000) describe the production of highly<br>
oleophobic surfaces using long chain perfluoroacrylate or perfluoroalkene precursors.<br>
[0008] WO97/38801 describes a method for the molecular tailoring of surfaces which<br>
involves the plasma deposition step being employed to deposit coatings with reactive<br>
functional groups, which groups substantially retain their chemical activity on the surface of<br>
a solid substrate, using pulsed and continuous wave plasma. Wu et al. discuss in their<br>
related publication, Mat.Res.soc. Symp.Proc, vol. 544 pages 77 to 87 the comparison<br>
between pulsed and continuous wave plasma for such applications.<br>
[0009] Two significant drawbacks exist for such pulsed vacuum plasma methods, firstly<br>
the necessity for a vacuum requires the coating process to be operated in a batch wise<br>
format, secondly the monomer must be introduced into the plasma as a vapour if the<br>
vacuum is to be maintained or the active is coated by conventional means and then in a<br>
separate step coated with an encapsulating plasma coating.<br><br>
[0010] One type of plasma is generally referred to as diffuse dielectric barrier discharge<br>
(one form of which can be referred to as an atmospheric pressure glow discharge Sherman,<br>
D.M. et al, J. Phys. D.; Appl. Phys. 2005, 38 547-554). This term is generally used to cover<br>
both glow discharges and dielectric barrier discharges whereby the breakdown of the<br>
process gas occurs uniformly across the plasma gap resulting in a homogeneous plasma<br>
across the width and length of a plasma chamber. ( Kogelschatz, U. 2002 "Filamentary,<br>
patterned, and diffuse barrier discharges" IEEE Trans. Plasma Sci. 30,1400-8) These<br>
may be generated at both vacuum and atmospheric pressures. In the case of atmospheric<br>
pressure diffuse dielectric barrier discharges , gases including helium, argon or nitrogen are<br>
utilised as process gases for generating the plasma and a high frequency (e.g.&gt; 1kHz)<br>
power supply is used to generate a homogeneous or uniform plasma between the<br>
electrodes at atmospheric pressure. The exact mechanism of formation of diffuse DBD is<br>
still a matter of debate but there is mounting evidence that Penning ionisation plays a critical<br>
roie, in combination with secondary electron emission from the cathode surface, (see for<br>
example, Kanazawa et al, J.Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 1988, 21, 838, Okazaki et al, Proc. Jpn.<br>
Symp. Plasma Chem. 1989, 2, 95, Kanazawa etal, Nuclear Instruments and Methods in<br>
Physical Research 1989, B37/38, 842, and Yokoyama et al., J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 1990,<br>
23, 374).<br>
[0011] Atmospheric pressure plasmas offer industry open port or perimeter systems<br>
providing free ingress into and exit from the plasma region by e.g. webbed substrates and,<br>
hence, on-line, continuous processing of large or small area webs or conveyor-carried discrete<br>
workpieces. Throughput is high, reinforced by the high species flux obtained from high<br>
pressure operation. Many industrial sectors, such as textiles, packaging, paper, medical,<br>
automotive, aerospace, etc., rely almost entirely upon continuous, on-line processing so that<br>
open port/perimeter configuration plasmas at atmospheric pressure offer a new industrial<br>
processing capability.<br>
[0012] WO 02/28548 describes a process to overcome the limitations to vacuum and<br>
some pulse type applications. By combining an atmospheric pressure plasma discharge,<br>
such as a diffuse dielectric barrier discharge, and an atomised precursor, a range of<br>
coatings may be deposited which retain the functionality of the precursor to a large degree.<br>
Using this technique, a controlled free radical polymerisation takes place and the monomer<br>
structure is significantly retained.<br><br>
[0013] Post discharge plasma systems have been developed to produce plasmas using<br>
gases passing between adjacent and/(or coaxial) electrodes at high flow rates. These gases<br>
pass through the plasma region defined by the shape of the electrodes and exit the system in<br>
the form of excited and/or unstable gas mixtures at around atmospheric pressure. These gas<br>
mixtures are characterized by being substantially free of electrical charged species, which may<br>
be utilized in downstream applications remote from the plasma region, i.e. the gap between<br>
the adjacent electrodes in which plasma is generated. This "atmospheric pressure post<br>
plasma discharge" (APPPD) has some of the physical characteristics of low pressure glow<br>
discharge and APGD including, for example, glow, presence of active light emitting species<br>
and chemical reactivity. However, some clear and unique differences exist including the<br>
facts that APPPD has higher thermal energy, absence of boundary walls e.g. no electrodes,<br>
substantial absence of electrically charged species, large choice of gases and mixture of<br>
gases, large flow rate of gases. Systems of this type are described in US 5807615, US<br>
6262523 and WO 2005/039753 which was published after the priority date of the present<br>
application.<br>
[0014] Hot-Filament Chemical Vapour Deposition (HFCVD) is an alternate method for<br>
depositing polymeric coatings on substrates which, unlike plasma enhanced Chemical<br>
Vapour Deposition (PECVD), does not use a plasma to initiate a free radical based CVD<br>
process but uses a heated filament to initiate a thermal CVD reaction. Recent work using<br>
HFCVD has shown that the addition of free radical initiators to a monomer vapour can result<br>
in increased retention of the monomer functionality in the resulting polymerised coating<br>
(Gleason et al, Langmuir, 2002, 18, 6424, and Gleason et al, J. Electrochem. Soc, 2001,<br>
148, F212).<br>
[0015] The use of catalysts to initiate free-radical polymerisation reactions is a well known<br>
and commonly used technique. For example, WO 0034341 describes a heterogeneous<br>
catalyst for the polymerisation of olefins. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,064,802, 5,198,401, and<br>
5,324,800 also describe selective catalysts for olefin polymerisation. U.S. Pat. No.<br>
2,961,245 describes the polymerisation of cyclotrisiloxane containing fluorinated<br>
hydrocarbon radicals, in the presence of a homogeneous initiator such as<br>
perfluoroalkanesulphonic acid and of linear organosiloxanes with triorganosilyl ends that are<br>
used as chain-blocking agents. A fluorinated silicone oil is thus obtained, after<br>
devolatilization, whose viscosity is essentially determined by the M2/D 3 ratio. The catalyst<br><br>
is optionally removed by distillation or washing. EP 0822240 describes a coating resin<br>
composition formed from an acrylate, organosilane and a curing catalyst.<br>
[0016] The present inventors found that, surprisingly, improvements in the retention of<br>
functionality of free-radical polymerised polymeric coatings may be achieved by the addition<br>
of a free-radical initiator to a free-radical polymerised monomer during plasma deposition<br>
processes. Also, the deposition rate of the coatings was found to increase when an initiator<br>
was used. The use of initiators is especially applicable in conjunction with liquid precursors<br>
and atmospheric pressure plasma techniques such as that described in WO 0228548. The<br>
addition of the initiator promotes free radical polymerisation through polymerisable groups<br>
within the monomer in preference to the alternative plasma promoted destructive<br>
fragmentation reactions which may take place.<br>
[0017] According to the present invention there is provided a method for forming a<br>
polymeric coating on a substrate surface, which method comprises the steps of<br>
i.	Plasma treating a mixture comprising a free-radical initiated polymerisable<br>
monomer having one or more free-radical polymerisable groups in the<br>
presence of a free radical initiator, wherein said plasma treatment is a soft<br>
ionisation plasma process; and<br>
ii. depositing the resulting polymeric coating material produced during step (i)<br>
onto a substrate surface.<br>
[0018] It shouid be understood that a soft ionisation plasma process is a process wherein<br>
precursor molecules are not fragmented during the plasma process and as a consequence,<br>
the resulting polymeric coating has the physical properties of the precursor or bulk polymer.<br>
[0019] Plasma treatment of the mixture is to be understood to include interaction with<br>
ionised and/or excited species both within the plasma or generated as a result of passing<br>
through the plasma.<br>
[0020] The form of plasma activation utilised may be any suitable type, provided it results<br>
in a "soft" ionisation plasma process. Any plasma generating equipment suitable for<br>
generating "soft" ionisation plasma may be utilised. Preferably, non-thermal equilibrium<br>
plasma equipment may be used. Suitable non-thermal equilibrium plasmas which may be<br><br>
utilised for the present invention include, diffuse dielectric barrier discharges such as<br>
atmospheric pressure glow discharge and dielectric barrier discharge (DBD), low pressure<br>
glow discharge, so called plasma knife type equipment (as described in WO 03/085693) or<br>
post discharge plasma. Preferably, the non-thermal equilibrium plasma equipment may be<br>
operated in either continuous mode or pulse mode. Preferred processes are "low<br>
temperature" plasmas wherein the term "low temperature" is intended to mean below 200°C,<br>
and preferably below 100 °C. These are plasmas where collisions are relatively infrequent<br>
(when compared to thermal equilibrium plasmas such as flame based systems) which have<br>
their constituent species at widely different temperatures (hence the general name "non-<br>
thermal equilibrium" plasmas).<br>
[0021] Suitable alternative plasma sources may for example comprise, microwave plasma<br>
sources, corona discharge sources (where appropriate), arc plasmas sources, DC<br>
magnetron discharge sources, helicon discharge sources, capacitatively coupled radio<br>
frequency (rf) discharge sources, inductively coupled RF discharge sources, low pressure<br>
pulsed plasma sources and/or resonant microwave discharge sources. Corona discharge<br>
systems generate locally intense electric fields, i.e. non-uniform electric fields generated using<br>
point, edge and/or wire sources. Corona systems have provided industry with an economic<br>
and robust means of surface activation for more than 30 years. They typically operate in<br>
ambient air resulting in an oxidative deposition environment, which renders control of<br>
deposition chemistry difficult. The design of corona systems is such as to generate locally<br>
intense plasmas which result in variations in plasma energy density across the plasma<br>
chamber. In regions of high energy density the substrate is prone to damage from the plasma<br>
whereas in low energy density areas the treatment rate is limited. Attempts to increase the<br>
treatment rate in the low energy density areas result in unacceptable levels of substrate or<br>
coating damage in the high energy regions. These variations in energy density lead to non-<br>
uniform deposition chemistry and/or non-uniform deposition rate across the plasma chamber.<br>
[0022] The choice of plasma source will generally be dictated by the dimensions of the<br>
substrate, with glow discharge type sources being used for thin films or plates and other<br>
more appropriate systems being used for three-dimensional substrates.<br>
[0023] Any conventional means for generating an atmospheric pressure plasma or post<br>
discharge may be used in the method of the present invention, for example atmospheric<br>
pressure diffuse dielectric barrier discharge techniques such as atmospheric pressure<br><br>
plasma jet, atmospheric pressure microwave glow discharge and atmospheric pressure<br>
glow discharge. Typically, atmospheric pressure diffuse dielectric barrier discharge (such as<br>
glow discharge processes) will employ helium as a process gas and a high frequency (e.g &gt;<br>
1kHz) power supply to generate a homogeneous plasma (e.g. a homogeneous glow<br>
discharge) at atmospheric pressure via, it is believed, a Penning ionisation mechanism.<br>
[0024] In the case of low pressure pulsed plasma, the monomers are preferably<br>
introduced into the plasma in the form of vapours and polymerisation is initiated by the<br>
plasma alone or, when present, in combination with the free radical initiator. The low<br>
pressure pulsed plasma may be performed with substrate heating and/or pulsing of the<br>
plasma discharge. Whilst for the present invention heating will not generally be required,<br>
the substrate may be heated to a temperature substantially as high as its melting point<br>
Substrate heating and plasma treatment may be cyclic, i.e. the substrate is plasma treated<br>
with no heating, followed by heating with no plasma treatment, etc., or may be<br>
simultaneous, i.e. substrate heating and plasma treatment occur together. The plasma may<br>
be generated by any suitable means such as radio frequency, microwave or direct current<br>
(DC). A radio frequency generated plasma of 13.56 MHz is preferred. A particularly<br>
preferred plasma treatment process involves pulsing the plasma discharge at room<br>
temperature or where necessary with constant heating of the substrate. The plasma<br>
discharge is pulsed to have a particular "on" time and "off' time, such that a very low<br>
average power is applied, for example of less than 10W and preferably less than 1W. The<br>
on-time is typically from 10 to 10000µs, preferably 10 to 1000µs, and the off-time typically<br>
from 1000 to 10000µs, preferably from 1000 to 5000jxs. The gaseous precursors may be<br>
introduced into the vacuum with no additional gases; however additional plasma gases such<br>
as helium or argon may also be utilized.<br>
[0025] Examples of suitable atmospheric pressure diffuse dielectric barrier discharge<br>
apparatus (e.g. glow discharge) include the apparatus described in the applicant's co-<br>
pending applications WO 02/35576, WO 03/086031 and WO 2004/068916. In WO<br>
02/35576 and WO 03/086031 the plasma is formed using pairs of electrode units. Any<br>
suitable electrode units may be used, for example, each electrode unit may contain an<br>
electrode and an adjacent a dielectric plate and a cooling liquid distribution system for<br>
directing a cooling conductive liquid onto the exterior of the electrode to cover a planar face<br>
of the electrode. Each electrode unit may comprise a watertight box having a side formed<br>
by a dielectric plate having bonded thereto on the interior of the box the planar electrode<br><br>
together with a liquid inlet and a liquid outlet. The liquid distribution system may comprise a<br>
cooler and a recirculation pump and/or a sparge pipe incorporating spray nozzles. WO<br>
2004/068916 describes a number of non-metallic based electrode systems. The<br>
atmospheric pressure plasma assembly may also comprise a first and second pair of vertically<br>
arrayed parallel spaced-apart planar electrodes with at least one dielectric plate between said<br>
first pair, adjacent one electrode and at least one dielectric plate between said second pair<br>
adjacent one electrode, the spacing between the dielectric plate and the other dielectric plate<br>
or electrode of each of the first and second pairs of electrodes forming a first and second<br>
plasma region which assembly further comprises a means of transporting a substrate<br>
successively through said first and second plasma regions and is adapted such that said<br>
substrate may be subjected to a different plasma treatment in each plasma region.<br>
[0026] It should be understood that the term vertical is intended to include substantially<br>
vertical and should not be restricted solely to electrodes positioned at 90 degrees to the<br>
horizontal.<br>
[0027] For typical atmospheric pressure diffuse dielectric barrier discharge generating<br>
apparatus (e.g. glow discharge plasma generating apparatus), the plasma is generated<br>
within a gap of from 3 to 50mm, for example 5 to 25mm. Thus, the method in accordance<br>
with the present invention has particular utility for coating films, fibres and powders when<br>
using atmospheric pressure glow discharge apparatus. The generation of steady-state glow<br>
discharge plasma at atmospheric pressure is preferably obtained between adjacent<br>
electrodes which may be spaced up to 5 cm apart, dependent on the process gas used.<br>
The electrodes being radio frequency energised with a root mean square (rms) potential of 1<br>
to 100 kV, preferably between 4 and 30 kV at 1 to 100 kHz, preferably at 15 to 40 kHz. The<br>
voltage used to form the plasma will typically be between 2.5 and 30 kV, most preferably<br>
between 2.5 and 10 kV however the actual value will depend on the chemistry/gas choice and<br>
plasma region size between the electrodes. Each electrode may comprise any suitable .<br>
geometry and construction. Metal electrodes may be used. The metal electrodes may be in<br>
the forms of plates or meshes bonded to the dielectric material either by adhesive or by some<br>
application of heat and fusion of the metal of the electrode to the dielectric material. Similarly,<br>
the electrode may be encapsulated within the dielectric material.<br>
[0028] Whilst the atmospheric pressure diffuse dielectric barrier discharge (e.g.glow<br>
discharge) assembly may operate at any suitable temperature, it preferably will operate at a<br><br>
temperature between room temperature (20° C) and 70° C and is typically utilized at a<br>
temperature in the region of 30 to 50° C.<br>
[0029] When using an atmospheric pressure diffuse dielectric barrier discharge assembly<br>
such as an atmospheric pressure glow discharge system the polymerisable monomers and<br>
initiators may be introduced into an atmospheric pressure glow discharge plasma as a<br>
vapour by conventional means, or as an atomised liquid. Monomers are preferably supplied<br>
to the relevant plasma region after having been atomised. When in liquid form, the coating-<br>
forming material may be atomised using any suitable atomiser. Preferred atomisers include,<br>
for example, ultrasonic nozzles, i.e. pneumatic or vibratory atomisers in which energy is<br>
imparted at high frequency to the liquid. The vibratory atomisers may use an<br>
electromagnetic or piezoelectric transducer for transmitting high frequency oscillations to the<br>
liquid stream discharged through an orifice. These tend to create substantially uniform<br>
droplets whose size is a function of the frequency of oscillation. The material to be<br>
atomised is preferably in the form of a liquid, a solid or a liquid/solid slurry. The atomiser<br>
preferably produces a coating-forming material drop size of from 10 to 100µm, more<br>
preferably from 10 to 50µm. Suitable ultrasonic nozzles which may be used include<br>
ultrasonic nozzles from Sono-Tek Corporation, Milton, New York, USA or Lechler GmbH of<br>
Metzingen Germany. Other suitable atomisers which may be utilised include gas atomising<br>
nozzles, pneumatic atomisers, pressure atomisers and the like. The apparatus of the<br>
present invention may include a plurality of atomisers, which may be of particular utility, for<br>
example, where the apparatus is to be used to form a copolymer coating on a substrate<br>
from two different coating-forming materials, where the monomers are immiscible or are in<br>
different phases, e.g. the first is a solid and the second is a gas or liquid. In a still further<br>
embodiment the free radical initiator and the monomer may be separately plasma treated<br>
(i.e. directed through separate plasma regions prior to inter-mixing and application onto a<br>
substrate). In which case the initiator and the monomer will require separate atomisers.<br>
[0030] An advantage of using an atmospheric pressure diffuse dielectric barrier discharge<br>
assembly e.g. an atmospheric pressure glow discharge assembly) for the plasma treating<br>
step of the present invention as compared with the prior art is that both liquid and solid<br>
atomised polymerisable monomers may be used to form substrate coatings, due to the<br>
method of the present invention taking place under conditions of atmospheric pressure.<br>
Furthermore, the polymerisable monomers can be introduced into the plasma discharge or<br><br>
resulting stream in the absence of a carrier gas, i.e. they can be introduced directly by, for<br>
example, direct injection, whereby the monomers are injected directly into the plasma.<br>
[0031] Preferably, deposition of the coating occurs whilst the substrate is in the plasma<br>
activation region.<br>
[0032] The process gas for use in either preferred plasma treatment of the method in<br>
accordance with the present invention may be any suitable gas but is preferably an inert gas<br>
or inert gas based mixture such as, for example helium, a mixture of helium and argon and<br>
an argon based mixture additionally containing ketones and/or related compounds. These<br>
process gases may be utilized alone or in combination with potentially reactive gases such<br>
as, for example, nitrogen, ammonia, O2, H2O, NO2, air or hydrogen. Most preferably, the<br>
process gas will be Helium alone or in combination with an oxidizing or reducing gas. The<br>
selection of gas depends upon the plasma processes to be undertaken. When an oxidizing<br>
or reducing process gas is required, it will preferably be utilized in a mixture comprising 90-<br>
99% inert or noble gas and 1 to 10% oxidizjng or reducing gas.<br>
[0033] The duration of the plasma treatment will depend upon the particular substrate and<br>
application in question.<br>
[0034] Preferably, where the method of the present invention utilises an atmospheric plasma<br>
glow discharge plasma assembly, the means of transporting a substrate is a reel to reel<br>
based process. Preferably in such a case the substrate may be coated on a continuous<br>
basis by being transported through an atmospheric plasma glow discharge by way of a reel<br>
to reel based process in which the substrate travels from a first reel, through a the plasma<br>
region and on to a second reel at a constant speed to ensure that all the substrate has a<br>
predetermined residence time within the respective plasma regions. The residence time in<br>
the plasma region may be predetermined prior to coating and rather than varying the speed<br>
of the substrate the length of the plasma region may be varied. The assembly may<br>
additionally comprise one or more pairs of typically vertical parallel orientated electrodes<br>
situated before or after the pair of electrodes in the first plasma zone.<br>
[0035] Optionally where required the substrate may be cleaned and/or activated prior to or<br>
after coating, using plasma generated from a suitable gas such as helium, nitrogen, oxygen,<br>
argon or air. Preferably said cleaning and/or activation step will be carried out by subjecting<br><br>
the substrate to exposure to a plasma treatment using the pair of parallel orientated<br>
electrodes situated before or after the plasma zone in which the coating is applied to the<br>
substrate. Preferably, the cleaning and/or activating step takes place prior to coating the<br>
substrate. Further treatments applied in additional plasma regions formed by the additional<br>
pairs of electrodes may be the same or different from that undertaken in the plasma regions<br>
described above. In the case when additional plasma regions are provided for pre-treatment<br>
or post-treatment the necessary number of guides and/or rollers will be provided in order to<br>
ensure the passage of the substrate through the assembly. Similarly preferably the substrate<br>
will be transported alternatively upwardly and downwardly through all neighbouring plasma<br>
regions in the assembly.<br>
[0036] In the case when further plasma regions are provided after the first and second<br>
plasma regions said additional plasma regions may, further activate the surface, or apply a<br>
coating;or might be utilised to activate the coated surface and then re-coat the surface, apply<br>
one ormore further coatings or the like, dependent on the application for which the substrate<br>
is intended.<br>
[0037] Any appropriate combination of plasma treatments may be used, for example the<br>
substrate may be initially plasma cleaned and/or activated using a helium gas plasma and then<br>
has a coating applied, for example, by application of a liquid or solid spray through an atomiser<br>
or nebuliser as described in the applicants co-pending application WO 02/28548.<br>
[0038] Alternatively the substrate may be first oxidised (in for example, an oxygen/Helium<br>
process gas) prior to coating.<br>
[0039] Any suitable polymerisable group(s) may be contained in the free-radical initiated<br>
poiymerisable monomer used in the method of the present. Preferably, each monomer<br>
comprises at least one unsaturated group such as a linear or branched alkenyl group e.g.<br>
vinyl, propenyl, hexenyl or an alkynyl group. Most preferably the monomer also comprises<br>
at least one other type of functional group which is not polymerised via a free radical<br>
polymerisation process, such groups may include, alcohol groups, carboxylic acid groups,<br>
carboxylic acid derivative groups such as aldehydes and ketones, esters, acid anhydrides,<br>
maleates, amides and the like, primary secondary or tertiary amino groups, alkyl halide<br>
groups, carbamate groups, urethane groups, glycidyl and epoxy groups, glycol and<br>
polyglycol groups, organic salts, organic groups containing boron atoms, phosphorus<br><br>
containing groups such as phosphonates, and sulphur containing groups such as<br>
mercapto, sulphido, sulphone and sulphonate groups, and grafted or covalently bonded<br>
biochemical groups such as amino acids and/or their derivatives, grafted or covalently<br>
bonded biochemical species such as proteins, enzymes and DNA. In view of the fact that<br>
the plasma process which takes place is of a "soft ionisation" type, the latter groups are not<br>
destroyed and therefore provide functionality to the resulting polymer coating on the<br>
substrate surface.<br>
[0040] Hence the monomers which may be utilised in the present invention may include<br>
methacrylic acid, acrylic acid, alkylacrylic acid, fumaric acid and esters, maleic acid, maleic<br>
anhydride, citraconic acid, cinnamic acid, itaconic acid (and esters), vinylphosphonic acid,<br>

methacrylates, and fluoroalkyl (meth)acrylates, and styrene, α-methylstyrene, halogenated<br>
alkenes, for example, vinylidene halides, vinyl halides, such as vinyl chlorides and vinyl<br>
fluorides, and fluorinated alkenes, for example perfluoroalkenes.<br>
[0042] Any suitable initiator may be utilised. Examples include, hydrogen peroxide and<br>

[0044] The monomer and initiator may be premixed and introduced into the plasma,<br>
preferably in the form of a monomer and initiator gaseous mixture or preferably in the form<br>
of a mixed atomised liquid. Alternatively they may be introduced into a plasma chamber<br>
separately at an appropriate rate. Preferably the monomer and initiator are premixed.<br>
[0045] The substrate to be coated may comprise any material, for example metal, ceramic,<br>
plastics, siloxane, woven or non-woven fibres, natural fibres, synthetic fibres cellulosic<br>
material and powder. Most preferably in the case of this invention the preferred substrate is<br>

enhancement of hydrophilic and hydrophobic coatings such as hydrophilic, biocompatible,<br>
anti-fouling and controlled surface pH applications of substrates. Controlled surface pH<br>
applications will include filtration (both gas and liquid) and separations media. The<br>

applications include the enhancement of the ability of additional materials to adhere to the<br>
substrate surface; the improvements in hydrophobicity, oleophobicity, fuel and soil<br>
resistance, and/or the release properties of the substrate; improvements in water resistance<br>
and enhancement of the softness of fabrics; furthermore the inclusion of colloidal metal<br>
species in the coatings may provide surface conductivity to the substrate, or enhance its<br>
optical properties<br>
[0047] The invention will be more clearly understood by reference to the following example<br>
with Reference to the figures in which :-<br><br>
Figure 1 is a general viewof)a plasma generating unit as used in the Examples hereinbelow<br><br>
Example 1:	Retention of acid functionality in polyacrylic acid deposition on to a<br>
polypropylene film using a dichlorobenzoyl peroxide initiator.<br>
[0048] Three liquid coating forming material compositions were prepared comprising<br>
acrylic acid (AA) and 0, 0.6 and 3% by weight of a 2,4, dichlorobenzoyl peroxide, 50%<br>
paste in poiydimethylsiloxane fluid (DCBP) sold as Perkadox® PD 50S-ps-a by Akzo Nobel<br>
Chemicals Inc.<br><br>
The compositions were used to form polyacrylic acid coatings on a polypropylene film being<br>
passed through an atmospheric pressure glow discharge plasma unit of the type described<br>
in the applicants co-pending patent application WO 03/086031 and as shown in Fig.1 <br>
herein.		<br>
[0049] Referring now to Fig.1, the flexible polypropylene and polyester fabric substrate was<br>
transported through the plasma assembly by means of guide rollers 70, 71 and 72. A helium<br>
process gas inlet 75, an assembly lid 76 and an atomiser such as an ultrasonic nozzle 74 for<br>
introducing atomised liquid coating forming material compositions into plasma region 60 are<br>
provided. Total plasma power applied to both plasma regions was 0.6 kW.<br>
[0050] In use, a 100mm wide web of flexible substrate was transported through the plasma<br>
assembly at a speed of speed of 4 m min-1. The substrate was initially directed to and over<br>
guide roller 70 through plasma region 25 between electrodes 20a and 26. The plasma<br>
generated between electrodes 20a and 26 in plasma region 25 was utilised as a cleaning<br>
helium plasma, i.e. no liquid coating forming material compositions was directed into plasma<br>
region 25. Helium was introduced into the system by way of inlet 75. Lid 76 is placed over the<br>
top of the system to prevent the escape of helium, as it is lighter than air. Upon leaving<br>
plasma region 25 the plasma cleaned substrate passes over guide 71 and is directed down<br>
through plasma region 60, between electrodes 26 and 20b and over roller 72. Plasma region<br>
60 however is utilised to coat the substrate with a polyacrylic acid coating derived from the<br><br>
atomised liquid coating forming material compositions referred to above and introduced into<br>
plasma region 60 through ultrasonic nozzle 74 at a rate of 50 µLmin-1 .<br>
[0051] Each atomised liquid coating forming material composition is plasma treated when<br>
passing through plasma region 60 generating a series of free radicals species arising from<br>
both the DCBP initiator (when present) and the plasma. These free radicals undergo<br>
polymerisation reactions and deposit onto the substrate to form a coating on the substrate as it<br>
passes through plasma region 60. The resulting coated substrate is then transported over<br>
roller 72 and is collected or further treated with additional plasma treatments. Rollers 70 and<br>
72 may be reels as opposed to rollers.<br>
XPS Analysis<br>
[0052] A Kratos Axis Ultra electron spectrometer equipped with an Al Kα X-ray source,<br>
and a concentric hemispherical analyser was used for XPS analysis of the resulting coated<br>
substrate. Photo-emitted electrons were collected at a take-off angle of 90° from the<br>
substrate surface. XPS spectra were accumulated on an interfaced PC computer and fitted<br>
using a Simplex minimisation algorithm with mixed Gaussian:Lorentzian peaks having<br>
variable full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM), with binding energy values constrained.<br>
Instrument sensitivity factors using Kratos library was taken as C(1s): O(1s) equals 0.278 :<br>
0.78.<br>
[0053] Using XPS analysis, the relative concentration of oxygen on the substrate surface<br>
was found to increase in the presence of a polyacrylic acid coating as might be expected but<br>
surprisingly further increases in Oxygen concentration were observed in the coatings<br>
resulting from the liquid coating forming material compositions comprising acrylic acid and<br>
DCBP. The use of a higher concentration of initiator led to an additional increase in oxygen<br>
concentration, as shown in Table 1 which compares the relative concentrations of oxygen<br>
with respect to polyacrylic acid coatings derived the different liquid coating forming material<br>
compositions.<br><br><br>
[0054] XPS Curve-fitting of the carbon (C 1s) core level provided information about the<br>
chemical nature of the deposit by comparison to the curve-fit for conventionally polymerised<br>
acrylic acid.<br>
[0055] For a plasma polymerised polyacrylic acid (ppPAAc) deposit prepared without the<br>
addition of an initiator using a 0.6 kW deposition power, the carbon (C 1s) core level shape<br>
was similar to that for conventionally polymerised acrylic acid (PAAc) although the peak<br>
associated with CO2X was lower in intensity than would be expected. By constraining the<br>
areas of the peaks related with PAAc, to the intensity of the CO2X peak, it became apparent<br>
that three additional peaks associated with the substrate were required: C-C (sub), C-OX,<br>
and C=0. Some minor oxidation of the acrylic acid based precursor was noted by the<br>
increased intensity of the C-OX peak, compared with its intensity on plasma treated<br>
polypropylene (5%).<br>
[0056] Addition of the initiator at a 0.6% level (10g acrylic acid / 0.062g DCBP) led to an<br>
increase in the size of the carboxylic acid peak.<br>
[0057] A further increase in CO2X peak intensity was observed on the addition of a higher<br>
concentration of initiator of 3% by weight (11.5g acrylic acid / 0.358 g DCBP).<br>
[0058] The relative concentrations of the functional groups making up the deposited<br>
ppAAc layer are presented in Table 2. The increase in concentration of the carboxylic<br>
function with increasing concentration of peroxide initiator is clearly seen. This indicates an<br><br>
increase in deposit thickness, i.e. an enhanced deposition rate by the addition of initiator. It<br>
was possible to estimate the thickness of the deposit using Hill's equation (JM Hill et al.,<br>
Chem. Phys. Lett, 1976, 44, 225) by comparing the intensity of the CO2X peak with the<br>
intensity of the synthetic peak related to C-C (sub).<br><br>
Example 2: Retention of acid functionality in polyacrylic acid deposition on to a<br>
polypropylene film using a diphenylethanedione Initiator.<br>
[0059] The process described in example 1 was repeated using an alternative initiator,<br>
diphenylethanedione (DPE), sold under the name Benzil by Sigma-Aldrich company Ltd,<br>
Dorset, UK) <br>
[0060] The addition of DPE initiator also led to noticeable improvements in the deposition<br>
of plasma polymerised acrylic acid as shown in Table 3. In this case, concentrations of 0.5,<br>
1.0,and 2.5% were compared to deposition with no initiator.<br><br><br>
[0061] In the case of Example 2, Contact angle analysis was additionally undertaken in<br>
order to assess the variation in hydrophilicity of resulting polyacrylic acid films prepared in<br>
accordance with the present invention.<br>
Contact Angle Analysis<br>
[0062] Contact angle analysis was undertaken using a CAM 20 Optical Contact Angle<br>
Meter apparatus (KSV Instruments LTD) which comprises a movable stage, an automated<br>
syringe and an optical device for recording images of the drops. A 2µl drop of HPLC grade<br>
water was deposited on each sample and an image of the droplet was recorded 30 seconds<br>
after deposition. The contact angles of both sides of the drop were determined. In the<br>
results provided in Table 4 below, it should be appreciated that the lower the water contact<br>
angle, the more hydrophilic the deposited coating.<br><br><br>
[0063] The water contact angle decreased from 99° for an untreated substrate, to 46° for a<br>
substrate having a polyacrylic acid coating derived from an initiator-free acrylic acid<br>
composition, however a very significant change is identified in the presence of the DPE<br>
initiator whereby the angle drops to approximately 18° for each concentration showing a<br>
significant improvement in hydrophilicity. It will be noted that the latter value is similar to the<br>
value of water contact angle on conventionally polymerised polyacrylic acid of 15°.<br>
Gas Phase Derivatisation (GPP)<br>
[0064] Further analysis of the resulting coating was undertaken using GPD as described in<br>
Chilkoti, A.; Ratner, B.D.; Briggs, D., Chem. Mater., 3, 1991, 51 -61 and further developed<br>
by Alexander et al., Alexander, M.R.; Wright, P.V.; Ratner, B.D., Surf. Interface Anal., 24,<br>
1996, 217-220 and Alexander, M.R.; Due, T.M., J. Mater. Chem., 8(4), 1998, 937 - 943.<br>
GPD is frequently used to obtain unambiguous information about the chemical environment<br>
of modified polymer surfaces. In the present case trifluoroethanol derivatisation was utilised<br>
as a means of determining the retention of the carboxylic acid functional groups in the<br>
polymer coating. The coating applied by the method in accordance with the present<br>
invention was then derivatised with trifluoroethanol to distinguish between carboxylic acid<br>
and carboxylic ester functionalities by the mechanism in Scheme 1 below:<br><br>
[0065] Subsequent to GPD the resulting derivatised coating was analysed by XPS to<br>
determine the retention of the carboxylic acid functional groups in the plasma polymerised<br>
polyacrylic acid coatings. A comparison of the ratio of COOH: COOC is provided in Table 5.<br><br><br>
[0066] As expected, conventionally polymerised polyacrylic acid has the highest<br>
concentration of COOH retained in the coating (88%). The plasma polymerised acrylic acid<br>
containing no benzil coating was seen to have 64% retention; indicating 36% of the acid<br>
groups have been crosslinked to form carboxylic esters. The retention of carboxylic acid<br>
increased with the use of initiator to 77%.<br>
[0067] These results are in good agreement with previous observations from water contact<br>
angle measurements and deposition rate, as shown by film thickness measurements.<br><br>

ABSTRACT<br><br>
METHOD FOR COATING A SUBSTRATE USING PLASMA<br>
The invention discloses a method for forming a polymeric coating on a substrate surface,<br>
which method comprises the steps of i) Plasma treating a mixture comprising a free-radical<br>
initiated polymerisable monomer having one or more free-radical polymerisable groups in the<br>
presence of a free radical initiator, wherein said plasma treatment is a soft ionisation plasma<br>
process and the monomer and initiator are either premixed and introduced into the plasma, in<br>
the form of a monomer and initiator gaseous mixture or mixed atomised liquid or<br>
alternatively the monomer and initiator are introduced into a plasma chamber separately, and<br>
ii) depositing the resulting polymeric coating material produced during step (i) onto a<br>
substrate surface.</td>
