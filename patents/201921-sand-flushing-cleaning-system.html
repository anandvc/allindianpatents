				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>In the Sand Flushing Cleaning System the method to be followed is an absolute must for restoring stagnating contaminated areas of liquid contents. In case of ponds, lakes and industrial wastes the method is to mix the sand with the contents until it attains a semi-solid state for removal. While for flowing water bodies sand filling has to commence only from a dead end or an artificial dead end. If 200 yards from the dead end side has been filled with sand, when digging up and restoring from the dead end side the sand being taken should be reused by dumping from the other end onwards, which expels the muddy waters further ahead (using of fresh sand only when absolutely needed). This repetition of work finally has the whole area restored for further usage or for the rains to fill it up. The artificial dead ends have to be removed only last.</td>

'COMPLETE SPECIFICATION'<br>
SAN FLUSHING CLEANING SYSTEM<br>
The invention is the Solution to water clogged areas gone beyond cleaning, resulting in mere stagnation.<br>
Many places have reached a stage that for man to exist in these surroundings have turned almost difficult, that one has to seek other places for one's survival.<br>
Many attempts have been made for cleaning such areas but not found very successful. As for this above method the advantage is, one finally, has access to the very length, breadth and depth of it, to better it to one's convenience or restore it to its original condition.<br>
This so called sand flushing cleaning system or SFC System can be applied on any water clogged area of stagnation, for instance in cases of ponds, lakes, factories and Company Wastes. Where the whole area has turned into slush (even worse) and gone beyond cleaning. In such places SFC System is performed by filling up the area with Sand, by gradually mixing up the existing contents with Sand till it reaches a semi-solid state for removal. Accordingly disposing of the contents, and digging up the area to a length, breadth, and depth to ones satisfaction, or restoring it to its original shape, for further usage.<br>
But as for rivers and canals where there is a beginning and an ending-being an outlet, which exists or is available. In such cases the sand filling has to commence strictly from the dead end or artificial dead end, or from the beginning. So as to move the watery, mucky substance ahead to its main outlet. If say two hundred Yards of a river or canal is filled with sand from the dead end side, then when digging up from the dead end side or the beginning, to a depth and width required, and having it cleaned for usage, all this dug up sand goes to the other extreme end, onwards. Thereby making ready one side, and sand flushing the other side. Thus this cycle of work continues on and on till the whole length of the river or canal is cleaned and<br><br>
made ready for further usage or for the rains to fill it up. Thus terming the above method as M.E.S.F.C.System (Methodical Economical Sand Flushing cleaning system).<br>
Whereas in the A.B.C.S.F. System where the method varies a little bit due to the large number of sewage outlets having been let out into the Coovum river. And the above method having been termed as the A.B.C.S.F. System. Where the first priority has to be given to pipe laying work as given in the Coovum River Project, that was first presented to the Executive Engineer on 29.09.03 in manuscript who appreciated the same and asked to make official in Typed matter. Same was presented to the Director, Department of Enviornment, Panagal Building' Saidapet, Chennai -600 015 on 08.10.03 in person, who only after a 40 minute discussion after having been convinced accepted the same, saying 1 shall put it up before a Board of Engineers. Later on, on enquiries office the stated that the same had been approved. This so called A.B.C.S.F. System of the Coovum river project is known as Another Beginning Cleaning Sand Flushing System. Say if a Kilometer of the Coovum River is divided into three equal parts from a dead end, named A.B.C. first pipe laying is to be done besides the Coovum river where space is normally available, connecting all the sewage outlets from A to C and a little beyond, with a bend or T pipe or a suitable provision made at the end, so as to let out the sewage waste into the same Coovum river beyond C as shown in the diagram. Sand filling starts from dead and A and proceeds upto B. thereby pushing ahead all the sewage contents from A to B and B to C or even beyond. Now when digging up from dead end A, that sand will be continued to be dumped from B to C. thereby making ready one side and continuing to sand flush the other side. On reaching C, sand filling work is stopped. Again the next Kilometer is treated in the same manner as in the previous A.B.C. Here the bend is removed and the new pipe line connected to the old pipe line that has now been extended beyond the next C with the bend or whatever provision made, and let into the same coovum river as previously done into the previous A.B.C. The rest of the work continues as in the previous manner, till the whole length of the Coovum River is made clean and left to be filled up by the rains as in the above previous methods (fresh sand being used until, when absolutely being needed). In all government<br><br>
projects sea sand may be used since it can be recycled for a longer period of time and its inexpensive. (Methods may vary but sand or sea sand being the basic substance used).<br>
Brief description of the drawings:<br>
Fig.l, lA        Shows Buildozers at work on a pond and lake, were work starts on the<br>
surroundings and then proceeds to the center as the liquid contents<br>
drop.<br>
Fig. 2	Shows a canal and river where work is in progress and starts from a<br>
dead end and proceeds to the main outlet in a cyclic manner.<br>
Fig. 3	Shows various positions in the A.B.C.S.F. System of the C.R.Project<br>
were top priority is given first to pipe laying work and then sand<br>
flushing.<br>
Detailed description of the above drawings :<br>
Referring Fig.l, lA it can be seen that the pond and lake has been filled with sand on the inner surroundings border. In Fig. 1 it shows that the whole surrounding of the pond has been filed with sand and after it having been mixed with the contents, it is being disposed. While in Fig.lA of sheet 1 it shows that the work on the lake has commenced and that while one vehicle is unloading the sand the other in rear is mixing the sand with the contents for its removal.<br>
Fig.2 shows a vehicle filling sand in the canal and going ahead, thereby moving ahead the slushy mucky contents. Whereas in the lower portion of the river it shows a wider area of sand filling completed and digging from dead end side commencing and sand being transported to the other end - or recycling work in progress.<br>
Fig.3 shows the first priority of pipe laying work for the first phase of the work in the coovum river project and the portion below show sand filling work is in progress, while in the third portion below it shows the cleaned dug up portion exposed to rains for filling it up and the recycled sand filled ahead, having completed the first phase of the work in the A.B.C.S.F. System of the C.R. project.<br><br><br><br><br>
I Claim,<br>
1.	Sand flushing cleaning system is the only system that can be made use of to<br>
restore or clean up a water clogged area of slushy or mucky contents that has<br>
reached a stagnating state, where the place has gone beyond normal cleaning.<br>
2.	Sand flushing cleaning system has to be applied in a methodical manner and<br>
this may also vary from one place to another.<br>
3.	sand flushing cleaning system when applied to ponds, lakes, Companies and<br>
factory wastes, where the discharge reaches a stagnating point beyond<br>
cleaning. Here the sand has to be mixed with the contents until it reaches a<br>
semi solid state for removal. Then dug up and cleaned for further usage.<br>
4.	Sand flushing cleaning system when applied to rivers and canals, sand filling<br>
has to commence only from the dead end side, so as to push the mucky, slushy<br>
contents ahead towards the main outlet. So now whon digging up and cleaning<br>
from the dead end side, this sand is dumped on the other side, this cyclic<br>
action has to continue on and on till the whole area is made clean. Using fresh<br>
sand only when absolutely needed.<br><br></td>
