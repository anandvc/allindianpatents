The needle set 30 has a holder body 31, an insert portion 32 formed of conical shape, a constraint portion 33 formed of a neck shape, a needle 35 which has a first needle tip 351 and a second needle tip 352 directing to the inside and outside of the barrel 10 respectively. And a rubber horse 37 fit on the second needle tip 352 of the needle 35.<br>
The ejecting set 40 has a fixation seat 41 which has a seat body 42 disposed inside the receiving hole 12 of the barrel 10, a stop flange 43 stopped on the second position portion 16 of the barrel 10, and insert hole 44; a needle ejector 45 which has an ejector body 46, a needle through hole 47 and a needle stop portion 48 for insert and stop the needle set 30 respectively; and an ejecting spring 49 which is a compression spring positioned between the fixation seat 41 and the needle ejector 45. The operation of the present invention is outlined hereinafter. First, put the ejecting set 40 inside the receiving hole 12 of the barrel 10, that is, the fixation seat 41 of the ejecting set 40 is positioned by the second position portion 16 of the barrel 10; and put the control part 20 into the barrel 10, that is, the engage hole 23 of the control part 20 is stopped by the needle set 30 and moving a little upper position; and formed a combination of the blood sampling device.<br>
In use, put the needle set 30 on, that is let the second needle tip 352 of the needle set 30 directing to the needle through hole 47 of the ejecting set 40, and push the needle set 30 inwards and let the constraint portion 33 of the needle set 30 to push the needle stop portion 48 of the ejecting set 40 and the ejecting spring 49 is compressed;<br><br>
