				<td>Process For The Preparation Of A Steel Surface For Hot-Dip Galvanising In A<br>
Zinc Based Molten Bath<br>
The present invention relates to a process for hot-dip<br>
galvanising of metals and steel in particular. It relates more<br>
specifically to the operations of cleaning, pickling and fluxing of<br>
the surface to be coated. The treated surfaces can then be galvanised<br>
by single immersion in a molten zinc-based bath which may contain<br>
high concentrations of aluminium, such as e.g. a Galfan bath. The<br>
process is especially suited for the galvanisation of continuous<br>
products such as steel wire, tube or sheet. This invention also<br>
relates to continuous steel product coated with a metallic layer<br>
consisting of bismuth.<br>
Aluminium-rich alloys such as Galfan, which mainly consists of<br>
95 wt% zinc and 5 wt% aluminium, impart higher corrosion protection<br>
to steel, improve its formability as well as its paintability<br>
compared to traditional hot-dip zinc alloys.<br>
Though aluminium-rich alloys were developed more than twenty<br>
years ago, their application for the coating of continuous products<br>
such as wires, tubes and sheets can only be performed by a limited<br>
number or rather sophisticated and relatively expensive processes.<br>
These processes are the double-dip process whereby regular<br>
galvanising precedes Galfan coating, the electrofluxing process<br>
whereby electroplating by a thin zinc layer precedes Galfan coating,<br>
and the hot process whereby a furnace with a reducing atmosphere is<br>
used before Galfan application. Numerous attempts to apply Galfan by<br>
the traditional and more affordable Cook-Norteman flux process on<br>
continuous lines, have failed.<br>
Considering the popularity of flux galvanising and its<br>
relatively low manufacturing cost, it seems very attractive to modify<br>
it in such a way that Galfan coating would become possible on<br>
continuous lines as well as in batch operations.<br>
The presence of aluminium and the absence of lead makes the<br>
Galfan coating process extremely sensitive to many common<br>
shortcomings of traditional galvanising, like insufficient cleaning<br><br>
and pickling, absence of flux drying and preheating, when cold and<br>
sometimes wet parts are immersed in molten zinc.<br>
Aluminium creates three main technological problems, which<br>
complicate the galvanising process:<br>
-	moisture or iron oxides on the steel surface reacts with molten<br>
aluminium and creates aluminium oxides, which are not wetted by<br>
molten zinc, according to the following reactions:<br><br>
-	a thin layer of zinc-aluminium oxides on the surface of molten bath<br>
unavoidably contacts the steel in the dipping area and degrades its<br>
wetting by molten zinc;<br>
-	the aluminium present in the molten zinc reacts with the flux and<br>
consequently deteriorates its effectiveness according to the<br>
reactions:<br><br>
These peculiar features of galvanising in the presence of<br>
aluminium create unsatisfactory coatings with bare spots, pinholes<br>
and surface roughness.<br>
It is thus an aim of this invention to alleviate the problems<br>
as described above.<br>
To this end, a process is disclosed for the preparation of a steel<br>
surface for single-dip aluminium-rich zinc galvanising comprising the<br>
steps of cleaning the surface by either one of electrocleaning,<br>
ultrasonic cleaning and brush cleaning to a level of less than 0.6<br>
µg/cm2 residual dirt, pickling the surface, and applying a protective<br>
layer to the surface by immersion in a flux solution comprising<br>
bismuth. When using electrocleaning, at least 25 C/dm2 can be passed<br>
through the steel surface. The pickling can be performed by either<br>
one of electropickling.<br><br>
ultrasonic pickling and ion exchange pickling using an Fe(III)<br>
chloride solution. The bismuth-bearing flux solution is prepared by<br>
using a soluble bismuth compound such as an oxide, a chloride or a<br>
hydroxychloride. It may contain between 0.3 and 2 wt% of bismuth,<br>
and, optionally, at least 7 wt% NH4Cl and 15 to 35 wt% ZnCl2. The<br>
preferred NH4Cl content is between 8 and 12 wt%. The molten zinc bath<br>
may contain at least 0.15 % aluminium, and, preferentially, 2 to 8 %<br>
aluminium. The bath may also consist of Galfan alloy. The steel may<br>
be in the form of a continuous product, such as wire, tube or plate.<br>
It appears that the Galfan fluxing process demands for an<br>
extremely clean steel surface, ensuring total absence of water<br>
breaks. If the soil concentration on the steel surface is too large,<br>
single-dip Galfan coating will not give good results. It was<br>
discovered that residual soil on the steel surface should not exceed<br>
0.6 µg/cm2, and preferably be less than 0.2 µg/cm2. This soil level<br>
guarantees absence of water breaks on the surface while rinsing, and<br>
is in fact commonly requested and achieved when subsequent<br>
electroplating is envisaged.<br>
It was established that for successful single dip Galfan<br>
coating using the traditional flux process, the same surface<br>
cleanliness is a necessity. To achieve the required cleanliness,<br>
three possible methods of treatment are available: electrocleaning,<br>
ultrasonic cleaning and brush cleaning.<br>
All three methods were tested on 5 mm low carbon steel wire and<br>
on 6.1 mm high carbon steel wire.<br>
Electrocleaning was performed with 1 to 4 anodic-cathodic<br>
cycles, the time period of one cycle being 0.6 sec. Regular current<br>
densities of 10 A/dm2 and high densities of 50 to 100 A/dm2 were<br>
tested. To achieve the desired level of cleanliness, not less than 25<br>
C/dm2 should pass through the surface. The cleaning solution<br>
contained 8 to 10 % of FERROTECH CIL-2 cleaner (manufactured by<br>
Ferrotech, PA, USA), consisting of (in wt%): 79.0 sodium hydroxide<br>
(50 % solution), 1.1 sodium carbonate, 5.0 sodium tripolyphosphate,<br>
2.5 surfactant package, and balance water. The solution temperature<br><br>
was 85 °C. A relatively high amount of cleaner in the working<br>
solution is necessary to obtain high electrical conductivity.<br>
Good cleaning was observed for a current density of 10 A/dm2<br>
after four 0.6 sec. cycles, and for a current density 50 A/dm2 after<br>
one 0.6 sec. cycle.<br>
Ultrasonic cleaning was performed with a circular transducer at<br>
a frequency of 20 kHz, and a specific power of 1 to 3 W/cm2. The<br>
cleaning solution was at 80 to 85 °C and contained 5 % of FERROTECH<br>
CIL-5 cleaner consisting of (in wt%) 4.0 tripotassium phosphate, 8.0<br>
trisodium phosphate, 16.0 Petro AA (Witco), 4.5 other surfactants,<br>
and balance water. A clean surface was obtained in 1 to 2 sec.<br>
Mechanical brush cleaning was performed at the same temperature<br>
and cleaning solution using a tough toothbrush. Energetic hand<br>
cleaning for 5 sec. per 25 cm wire length made samples totally fit<br>
for further treatment.<br>
It may be concluded that any of described procedures can be<br>
used for wire cleaning depending of existing equipment on real life<br>
line.<br>
Samples which were not properly cleaned (with an amount of soil<br>
corresponding to 1 to 2 ug/cm2) and which therefore had water breaks<br>
on the surface demonstrated pinholes in Galfan coatings and bad<br>
adhesion after treatment with a Bi containing flux.<br>
The cleaning procedure time depends on the amount of soil on<br>
the steel surface and the cleaning method used. This is illustrated<br>
in Table 1.<br><br><br>
(*) HCD: high current density electrocleaning (50 to 100 A/dm2)<br>
After cleaning, wire samples were pickled in hydrochloric acid<br>
(18.5 % solution) at room temperature for 5 sec. After rinsing,<br>
fluxing and preheating, samples were coated with Galfan. The coating<br>
had bare spots, pinholes and substantial roughness.<br>
Increasing pickling time reduced the number of coating defects.<br>
The Galfan coating became very good after 10 min. pickling. As far as<br>
this time period of pickling is totally unacceptable for industrial<br>
line, three other methods were tested: electropickling, ultrasonic<br>
pickling and ion exchange pickling.<br>
Electropickling was performed in the HC1 solution described<br>
above with anodic current densities of 10 A/dm2 for 3 to 5 sec. and<br>
50 A/dm2 for 0.5 to 1 sec. In both cases, Galfan coating was smooth,<br>
uniform and without defects.<br>
The same good results were observed after ultrasonic pickling<br>
for 5 sec. in the above-mentioned equipment used for the ultrasonic<br>
cleaning and using the HCl solution described above.<br>
Finally, a special pickling method was proposed. When steel is<br>
dissolved in hydrochloric acid, iron enters the solution as ferrous<br>
divalent cation Fe2+. The electrode potential of this reaction<br>
Fe2+/Fe by standard hydrogen electrode is -0.44 V. At the same time<br><br>
trivalent ferric cation Fe3+ can be reduced to metal iron at +0.33 V.<br>
So, if in acid solution, which contains Fe3+, a steel sample is<br>
immersed, two reactions take place:<br>
-	metal iron is dissolved and creates ferrous cation Fe2+<br>
Fe° - 2e -&gt; Fe2+ ; and<br>
-	ferric iron Fe3+ is reduced to metal iron<br>
Fe3+ + 3e -&gt; Fe0 .<br>
For every 3 created ferrous ions 2 ferric ions become metallic. The<br>
reaction is very rapid, because its electromotive force is high:<br>
E = E(Fe/Fe3+) - E(Fe/Fe2+) = 0.33 V - (-0.44 V) = 0.77 V<br>
As a result, the concentration of ferric ion in the pickling solution<br>
gradually drops, while the amount of ferrous ion proportionally<br>
increases. To keep the solution in equilibrium, the ferrous ions have<br>
to be oxidised, which can be done with any oxidiser or which can<br>
happen naturally by air oxygen.<br>
The described phenomenon was used in an accelerated pickling<br>
procedure: wire from low and high carbon steel was pickled in 18.5 %<br>
HC1 solution for 3 to 5 sec, rinsed and immersed for 3 to 5 sec. in<br>
10 % FeCl3 solution at 50 °C. The sample surface became uniformly<br>
grey. The wire samples were then rinsed, fluxed, dried and preheated,<br>
and were then easily coated by Galfan without any defects.<br>
A good fluxing agent for Galfan should be able:<br>
-	to create a thin protective metallic layer on the steel surface<br>
without applying electricity (no electroplating);<br>
-	to protect this layer and steel substrate from oxidation during<br>
drying/heating;<br>
-	to be easily removable from steel surface in molten Galfan.<br>
In regular galvanising, ammonium chloride is present in the<br>
flux, and fulfils two functions, one of them being the reduction of<br>
iron oxides and the other one the flux removal from the steel surface<br>
by generating an energetic gaseous torrent through the molten zinc.<br>
In a Galfan coating process the first function is almost nullified<br>
because of the strong aluminium affinity to chlorine. The opinion was<br>
established that specifically the AlCl3 formed deteriorates the Galfan<br>
coating, thereby creating pinholes and uncoated spots. So, the idea<br><br>
of reducing NH4Cl level in the flux to improve the coating quality<br>
was quite natural. As the function of flux removal remains very<br>
important, and this particularly on continuous lines, the NH4Cl level<br>
however cannot be reduced too much. That is why, in order to find an<br>
adequate flux formulation for Galfan, it was necessary to find out in<br>
what the optimum NH4Cl level in the flux is.<br>
Three aqueous fluxes with 25 wt% ZnCl2 and 1, 5 and 10 wt%<br>
NH4Cl were tested. The aluminium content in a bath with High Grade<br>
Zinc (containing 0.03 wt% Pb) was gradually increased from 0 up to<br>
1.8 wt%. At higher aluminium content it was impossible to obtain a<br>
good coating with these traditional fluxes, because the first NH4Cl<br>
function was dramatically weakened. Steel panels measuring 1.5 x 40 x<br>
100 mm were cleaned and pickled as described before, then fluxed with<br>
a flux without bismuth for 1 minute at 70 to 75 °C. The panels were<br>
dried in an electrical furnace at 200 °C for 2 min. The zinc bath<br>
temperature was 450 to 455 °C, and the immersion time was 2 min.<br>
Before withdrawal from bath, panels were vigorously moved up and down<br>
to remove flux remnants. The experimental results are presented in<br>
Table 2.<br><br>
It can be seen from Table 2, that up to 0.1 % Al smooth, shiny<br>
coatings without pinholes can be obtained at all levels of NH4Cl in<br>
the flux. However, the higher the aluminium content of the bath, the<br>
more NH4Cl is needed to achieve a good coating. With 10 wt% NH4Cl in<br>
the flux, perfect coatings can be obtained up to at least 1.8 % Al.<br>
It was found out that the amount of gaseous AlCl3 while<br>
galvanising with 1.8 % Al in the bath is practically the same as when<br><br>
Galfan is used. Therefore the conclusion can be drawn, that the<br>
optimum NH4Cl content in the flux is between 8 and 12 wt%, preferably<br>
around 10 wt% NH4Cl. This was confirmed when a flux for Galfan was<br>
formulated.<br>
It was shown above that variations of ZnCl2 and NH4Cl in<br>
conventional fluxes would not guarantee good Galfan coatings. At the<br>
same time thin layers of other metals are known to be very<br>
beneficial, as with zinc electroplating. That is why the chemical<br>
deposition of different metals from water solutions on iron (steel)<br>
has been thoroughly investigated in the fluxing application. The<br>
process, also referred to as ion exchange or cementation, consists of<br>
dissolving iron (by oxidation) and precipitation on its surface the<br>
other metal (by reduction), which has a more positive standard<br>
electrode potential, than iron. Thermodynamically, the ion exchange<br>
process becomes possible when the difference of standard electrode<br>
potentials (electromotive force) of the depositing metal M and iron<br>
is positive:<br>
E = E (M/Mn+) - E (Fe/Fe2+) &gt; 0.<br>
In this case iron serves as anode, dissolves and its atoms<br>
become cations Fe2+, while more positive metal cations Mn+ are<br>
reduced and become metal M. The commercially feasible metals like<br>
tin, nickel, antimony, iron, copper and bismuth meet this<br>
requirement, but not zinc.<br>
In several experiments wire samples 85 to 100 mm long, with a<br>
diameter of 5.15 mm (low carbon steel), or 6 mm (high carbon steel)<br>
were used for determining a flux composition enabling a good Galfan<br>
coating. Surface preparation - cleaning, pickling and rinsing - was<br>
performed as described previously. After the flux treatment the<br>
samples were dried in an electrical furnace at 300 to 320 °C for 2 to<br>
5 min. with a temperature at the wire surface in the range of 130 to<br>
250 °C The Galfan bath was run at 440 to 460 °C, the time in the<br>
molten metal was 3 to 6 sec. Before withdrawal, the samples were<br>
energetically moved up and down twice to remove flux remnants.<br>
A first flux with copper contained (in wt%): ZnCl2 - 25; NH4Cl<br>
- 9; CuCl2 - 1.5; HCl - 0.1; Merpol A (wetting agent) - 0.02. The pH<br><br>
was 0.8 and the fluxing temperature was around 25°C. The residence<br>
time in the flux was 3 to 5 sec.<br>
A further flux with nickel contained (in wt%): ZnCl2 - 25;<br>
NH4Cl - 9; NiCl2 - 2; HCl - 0.04; Merpol A - 0.02, it had a pH of 2.0<br>
and the flux bath temperature was 70 to 75 °C. The residence time in<br>
the flux was 1.5-2 min.<br>
A flux with iron contained (in wt%) : ZnCl2 - 25; NH4Cl - 9;<br>
FeCl3 - 8; HCl - 2; Merpol A - 0.02, it had a pH of 2.0 and the flux<br>
bath temperature was 70 to 75 °C. The residence time in the flux was<br>
1 to 1.5 min.<br>
A flux with tin contained (in wt%): ZnCl2 - 25 to 30; NH4Cl - 8<br>
to 12; SnCl2 - 2 to 3; HCl - 3.5 to 4; wetting agent - 0.04. The flux<br>
had a pH of 0, the temperature was maintained at 75 to 80 °C, and the<br>
time in the flux was 2 to 3 min. for a batch and 3 to 6 sec. for a<br>
continuous line.<br>
After fluxing, the samples were heated at 100 to 200 °C and<br>
coated in a Galfan bath. In the laboratory test it was important that<br>
all steel samples move through the molten Galfan and exit in the<br>
direction of the wire axis, like on a real-life line.<br>
All the samples had smooth and shiny coatings, but except for<br>
the test samples treated with tin fluxes, they also had pinholes and<br>
3 to 5 % of uncoated small (1 to 2 mm) spots.<br>
Further improvements of the flux with copper were investigated,<br>
because the high speed of copper deposition on steel makes it very<br>
attractive for wire lines. A flux with copper and tin chlorides was<br>
tested which contained (in wt%): ZnCl2 - 25; NH4Cl - 10; CuCl2 - 0.5;<br>
SnCl2 - 1 - 3; HCl - 4; Merpol A - 0.02. The pH was 0.15 and the flux<br>
temperature around 25 °C. It was earlier discovered in our<br>
investigations, that copper and tin co-deposit simultaneously on<br>
steel, creating copper-tin alloy-bronze of varying composition. In<br>
certain conditions (high SnCl2/CuCl2 ratio), yellow-gold bronze with<br>
18 % Sn can be deposited. However, it was found that bronze<br>
deposition provides no improvement in the quality of Galfan coating<br>
compared to copper.<br><br>
In the experiments with the tin containing flux, the Galfan<br>
coating was very good, shiny and without any defects. However,<br>
besides the fact that tin contaminates the zinc bath, tin cementation<br>
is too slow (e.g. for wire applications) and the presence of tin<br>
promotes intergranular corrosion of the Galfan coating.<br>
An experiment was carried out with an antimony containing flux<br>
with the following composition (in wt%) : ZnCl2 - 25; NH4Cl - 10; Sb2O3<br>
- 0.7; Merpol HCS - 0.02. The pH was 0.1. The results with a<br>
traditional galvanising bath were very good, but it was found that<br>
molten Galfan does not wet wire samples being coated with a thin<br>
layer of Sb.<br>
In experiments with Bi fluxes, due to the high electromotive<br>
force of the Fe/Bi couple, the bismuth deposition proceeds at very<br>
high speed. 3 to 5 sec. at ambient temperature suffice to create a<br>
dark grey or black protective layer on the steel surface. Two flux<br>
formulations, with a composition as given in Table 3 demonstrated the<br>
best results.<br><br>
In these fluxes, Bi2O3 and BiOHCl are interchangeable. Any other<br>
soluble Bi compound can be added to the flux, in an amount suitable<br>
to form a continuous metallic film on the steel surface upon fluxing.<br>
On the steel surface, Bi3+ is reduced to Bi and partially to Bi2+,<br><br>
creating a metal coating and the deposition of BiCl2 of black colour.<br>
Higher flux temperatures (around 40 °C) and prolonged exposure times<br>
do not substantially increase the thickness of the bismuth layer, but<br>
promote ample precipitation of BiCl2 In these circumstances, the<br>
flux becomes needlessly exhausted. The flux in Example 2 cannot be<br>
used at high heating temperatures as NH4Cl starts to evaporate<br>
excessively upon heating.<br>
The Galfan coatings applied after fluxing and heating to 140 to<br>
230 °C were very smooth, shiny and without any defects like pinholes<br>
or bare spots.<br>
Using the flux from Example 1 above, wire samples of low and<br>
high carbon steel were coated with Galfan at 450 to 455 °C with<br>
immersion times of 3 to 5 sec. Three samples were galvanised for each<br>
kind of steel and coating thickness was averaged after 10<br>
measurements. Galfan coating thickness for low carbon steel was 8 µm,<br>
for high carbon 12 µm.<br>
The influence of the bath temperature on Galfan coating<br>
thickness was investigated. The galvanising was performed at 510, 530<br>
and 550 °C with immersion times of 5 sec, 1 min. and 2 min. The<br>
results of this experiment are presented in Table 4.<br><br>
The coating thickness on high carbon steel wire does not<br>
increase substantially with elevating bath temperature. At the same<br><br>
time, for low carbon steel it can increase by more than 5 times for 5<br>
sec. Still, the coating obtained at 530 to 550 °C is very rough,<br>
which is caused by Fe-Al-Zn dendrites. At wire bending on 180 °,<br>
there was no coating peeling or cracking.<br>
In all experiments it was noticed that whenever the proper<br>
surface cleaning had not taken place, as mentioned before, the<br>
coating quality was severely deteriorated by the presence of pinholes<br>
and bad coating adhesion. The conclusions of all of the experiments<br>
is that only the combination of proper cleaning procedures and the<br>
use of a bismuth containing flux guarantees that the coatings<br>
obtained in a single dip Galfan bath are of excellent quality.<br><br>
