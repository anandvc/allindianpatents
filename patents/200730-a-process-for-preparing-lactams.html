The present invention relates to a process for preparing lactams by cyclizing hydrolysis of amino nitriles with water in the gas phase on metal oxide catalysts.<br>
Lactams are compounds which can be employed in a variety of ways. For example, N-methylpyrrolidone is a versatile solvent and e-caprolactam is an important monomer for polyamide fibers. Caprolactam is prepared industrially by a Beckmann rearrangement of the oxime of cyclohexanone. This reaction results in large amounts of salts, generally sodium sulfate, as byproduct which must be disposed of.<br>
US 2 357 484 discloses a process for preparing cimides and lactams from the corresponding nitriles and amines, and the amino nitriles respectively, by gas-phase reaction with water on catalysts with dehydrating properties. Catalysts indicated as usable are, in particular, alumina, silica gel and boric/phosphoric acid.<br>
WO 96/22974 describes a process for preparing lactams by cyclizing hydrolysis of amino nitriles, using alumina catalysts with a specific surface area of &gt; 10 m/g and a pore volume (of pores with a diameter of more than 500 A) &gt; 10 ml/100 g.<br>
US 4 628 085 discloses a process for preparing lactams in the gas phase, where an aliphatic or aromatic cimino nitrile and water are brought into contact with a silica-based catalyst with BET surface areas of more than 250 m/g and pore diameters of less than 20 nm in the presence of hydrogen and ainmonia.<br>
The use of metal phosphates, especially aluminum, zirconium, niobium and lanthanum phosphates, as catalysts for preparing lactams in the gas phase from amino nitriles and water is described in EP-A 659 741. These catalysts can also be impregnated with basic alkali metal or alkaline earth metal compositions, with cesium, rubidium and potassium being preferred.<br>
EP-A 748 797 discloses a process for preparing lactams from dinitriles, where the dinitrile is hydrogenated to the amino nitrile, and the amino nitrile is converted into the lactam by cyclizing hydrolysis. Disclosed as catalyst for the cyclizing hydrolysis are molecular sieves such as acidic zeolites, silicates and non-zeolite molecular sieves, metal phosphates and<br><br>
metal oxides or mixed oxides, which are, where appropriate, acidic or amphoteric due to treatment with halogens, ammonium halides or acids such as sulfuric acid or hydrohalic acid.<br>
The disadvantage of the described processes is that the selectivity of the catalysts is inadequate in some cases, which on the one hand makes it difficult to isolate the lactams, and on the other hand leads to poisoning of the catalysts by the byproducts which are formed. It is also desirable to increase the activity of the catalysts.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a process for preparing lactams by cyclizing hydrolysis of amino nitriles which affords them with high selectivity and high space-time yield and, moreover, allows a long useful life of the catalyst.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by reacting the amino nitriles with water on oxides of the metals of groups 3, 4, 5, 13 and/or 14 of the Periodic Table as catalysts which comprise a phosphate, carbonate, silicate, arsenite, arsenate, antimonite, antimonate or nitrate of said metals and, where appropriate, a metal oxide of groups 6, 7, 8, 9 and/or 10.<br>
The present invention therefore relates to a process for preparing lactams by cyclizing hydrolysis of amino nitriles with water in the gas phase on metal oxide catalysts, wherein the catalysts comprise:<br>
at least one oxide or mixed oxide of the metals of groups 3, 4, 5, 13 and/or 14 of the Periodic Table,<br>
one or more oxides or mixed oxides of metals of groups 6, 7, 8, 9 and/or 10,<br>
at least one carbonate, silicate, phosphate, arsenite, arsenate, antimonite, antimonate and/or nitrate and/or when oxides or mixed oxides of metals of groups 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 are present, a sulfate of the abovementioned metals.<br>
The numbering of the groups of the Periodic Table in this specification is in accordance with the 1985 lUPAC proposal.<br>
Catalysts preferred according to the invention are compounds of the formula I:<br>
MQa(ROb)cOd	(I)<br><br>
in which<br>
M is Zr, Ti or Hf,<br>
R is P, As or Sb,<br>
Q is a metal from group 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10,<br>
a is a number from 0 to 0.1,<br>
b is a number from 0.5 to 5,<br>
c is a number from 0.001 to 0.15, and<br>
d has the magnitude necessary to achieve neutrality of charge.<br>
The catalysts comprise up to five molecules of water per formula unit. If a 0.001, R can also be S.<br>
Catalysts which are particularly preferably used are compounds of the formula I in which<br>
R is P or, if a    0.001, can also be S,<br>
Q is Mn,<br>
a is 0 to 0.1 and very particularly preferably 0 to 0.03, and<br>
c is 0.001 to 0.1 and very particularly preferably 0.01 to 0.1, and particularly preferred compounds are those in which R is P and Q is Mn.<br>
The catalyst materials can be employed in any suitable form such as, for example, as powder, as chips or else as shaped articles. Examples of shaped articles which are used are extrudates or beads. For the shaping, a binder can be added, such as, for example, Aerosil, potato starch or cellulose, for example Walocel supplied by Wolff-Walstrde AG, these binders not being present in stated formula I. It is likewise possible for the catalyst materials to be applied to a carrier such as, for example, alumina, silica gel, carbon, silicon carbide or silicon _<br><br>
nitride. The catalyst is preferably used in the novel process in the form of chips or shaped articles.<br>
The catalyst bed may be mixed with a component to increase the selectivity in amounts of from 0 to 70% by volume. Examples thereof are silicon dioxide, preferably quartz, silicon nitride and silicon carbide.<br>
The catalysts are prepared in a manner known per se and familiar to the skilled worker. The novel catalysts can be obtained, for example, by contacting at least one oxide and/or hydroxide of a metal of groups 3, 4, 5, 13 and/or 14 of the Periodic Table one or more times with suitable phosphates, sulfates, carbonates, silicates, arsenites, arsenates, antimonites, antimonates or nitrates, and then calcining at elevated temperature. Suitable examples are the corresponding salts of metals of groups 3, 4, 5, 13 and 14 of the Periodic Table, the ammonium salts of oxo acids of these metals and, if desired, the salts of the metals of groups 6 to 10 of the Periodic Table, and phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid or nitric acid and their ammonium salts.<br>
The contacting takes place, for example, by adding a solution of the required phosphate, carbonate, silicate, nitrate, arsenite, arsenate, antimonite, antimonate or sulfate, or of the corresponding free acid, to an aqueous suspension of the metal oxide or hydroxide of groups 3, 4, 5, 13 or 14 of the Periodic Table, and then removing the water. This procedure can be repeated. The required components can be brought into contact all at once or in separate steps with the suspension of the metal oxide. In place of the solutions of the abovementioned salts, it is also possible to employ solutions of different salts of these metals in sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid or nitric acid, which is diluted with water where appropriate, as long as the anion of these salts forms a volatile acid with the mineral acid. Suitable salts are thus also the halides and the acetates as long as these are employed in one of the abovementioned acids or in aqueous solutions of these acids.<br>
The components can moreover be converted into a homogeneous solution from which a crude catalyst composition is obtained, for example by evaporation or by addition of a precipitant, and is then converted into the active form of the catalyst by drying and calcination.<br>
A further possible procedure is to spray a molding of the metal oxide, such as pellets, beads, hemispheres or extrudates, with aqueous solutions of suitable salts or the free acids. This<br><br>
jrocedure can be repeated several times, as a rule carrying out Irying steps between the individual impregnation steps.<br>
In a preferred preparation process, the metals or metal oxides ire brought into contact with one of the abovementioned free icids in a first step and then, after a drying step, if required, )rought into contact with an aqueous solution of a suitable metal ialt of groups 6 to 10 of the Periodic Table, in the case of langanese for example with Mn(N03)2, MnS04, MnHP04, MnCOa or MnCl2, ■.he  latter being employed in optionally dilute sulfuric, nitric &gt;r phosphoric acid. Drying and calcination are then carried out.<br>
'he procedure for preparing catalysts based on zirconium oxide and analogously for the other metal oxides) which are doped with ' can, for example, be to suspend commercially available ;irconium oxide and/or zirconium hydroxide in water, bring the luspension into contact with dilute phosphoric acid or an aqueous jranonium phosphate solution, remove the water, for excimple by listillation under reduced pressure, and dry the residue. The irude catalyst composition obtainable in this way can be either iirectly calcined or further processed to shaped articles and hen calcined. It is also possible for the drying step to be ollowed by another impregnation step with an aqueous solution of , salt of a metal of groups 6 to 10, for example a manganese alt.<br>
he calcination is normally carried at from 500 to 900°C, referably at about 700oc in 5 to 25 hours, preferably 10 to 0 hours. During this there is conversion, for example, of HPO42-r H2PO4- into P2O74- and other cyclic phosphates and of HCO3- into O32-. However, this conversion preferably does not take place ompletely under the chosen conditions so that, for example on se of P, there is still PO43- remaining in the resulting atalyst.<br>
he Zr contents of the individual catalysts, determined by X-ray luorescence analysis (R. Bock: Methoden der analytischen Chemie, d. 2, Nachweis- und Bestimmungsmethoden Teil 1, Verlag Chemie, einheim 1980), are between 60 and 71 g, preferably between 65 nd 70 g, per 100 g of catalyst. The P, S and Mn contents are etermined by ICP (Inductively Coupled Plasma) atomic emission pectroscopy (A. Montasa, D. W. Golightly: Inductively Coupled lasmas in Analytical Atomic Spectrometry, 2nd edition, Verlag hemie, Weinheim). Typical values are P: 0.2 to 1 g/100 g; S: 0.1 o 1 g/100 g and Mn: 0.1 bis 5 g/100 g of catalyst.<br><br>
Normally used in the novel process are amino nitriles of the formula II:<br>
RiHN-X-CN	(II)<br>
in which X is an alkylene unit having at least 2 and at most 20 atoms. As a rule, these are carbon atoms, but there may also be one  or more, but preferably not more than three, boron, nitrogen, phosphorus, oxygen and/or sulfur atoms present at any position vithin the alkylene unit. Between the amino group of the general formula -NR^H and the nitrile group there are at least 2, and preferably 3 to 6, atoms, preferably carbon atoms. Examples of alkylene are ethylene, 1,2- and 1,3-propylene, 1,2-, 1,3-, 1,4-, 2,3-butylene and 2-methyl-1,3-propylene, 1,2-, 1,3-, 1,4-, 1,5-, 2,3-, 2,4-pentylene, 2-ethyl-1,3-propylene, 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-propylene and 2- or 3-methyl-l,4-butylene, 1,2-, 1,3-, 1,4-, L,5- and 1,6-hexylene, 2-, 3- or 4-methyl-1,5-pentylene, 2,2- or 2,3-dimethyl-l,4-butylene, 2- or 3-ethyl-l,4-butylene, 2-ethyl-2-methyl-l,3-propylene and 2-propy1-1,3-propylene, 3-oxa- and 3-thia-l,5-pentylene. R^ is hydrogen or a straight-chain or Dranched alkyl group having up to 20 carbon atoms. Examples of suitable alkyl groups are methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, i-butyl, sec-butyl, n-pentyl, n-hexyl and 2-ethylhexyl. Amino litriles with linear alkylene units X with 3, 4, 5 or 6 carbon items and primary cimino groups are preferably used, i.e. 1-aminobutyronitrile, 5-aminovaleronitrile, e-aminocapronitrile ind 7-aminoenanthonitrile, particularly preferably e-amino-;apronitrile. The ratio of water to amino nitrile can be in the range from 1 to 50 mol/mol, preferably from 1 to 15 mol/mol.<br>
Che reaction can be carried out either in an agitated or in a stationary catalyst bed. The gas-phase reaction is preferably carried out on a fixed bed. The fixed bed can be arranged, for example, as a single bed or else divided over several trays. In :he latter case, it is possible to influence the composition and ;he physical properties of the reaction mixture between the trays Ln a beneficial manner, for example by adding reactants or inert jases or using, for example, heat exchangers. The fixed bed may idditionally be arranged in one or more reaction chambers, e.g. Ln a tube bundle reactor.<br>
The reaction temperature will usually be in the range from 200 to 550°C, preferably from 300 to 400oc. A temperature which is too Low would make the evaporation of the starting material iifficult, and, in addition, high conversions can be achieved 3nly with difficulty under these conditions. If the temperatures<br><br>
are too high there is increased formation of byproducts and decomposition products.<br>
The pressure can be in the range from 0.01 to 10 bar during the i reaction. The reaction is preferably carried out under atmospheric pressure.<br>
The reaction can	also be carried out with the addition of inert<br>
-gas, for example	argon or nitrogen. The molar ratio of inert gas<br>
I to amino nitrile	can be, where appropriate, in the range from 0<br>
to 100 mol/mol.<br>
The discharge from the reactor usually contains not only the .lactam as product but also unreacted amino nitrile and water, and ammonia or amine and, in small amounts, byproducts such as amino carboxamides. The lactam can be isolated therefrom in a manner known per se, for example by distillation, extraction or crystallization.<br>
I Typically, from 50 to 2000 g, preferably more than 500 g, of amino nitrile/1 of catalyst per hour are fed into the reactor. The amino nitrile conversions are then in the range from 70 to 99.9%. The selectivity for lactam formation is, as a rule, above 85% based on amino nitrile employed. Selectivities achieved with preferred catalysts are also &gt; 90% and, in particular, &gt; 93%. These figures are even reached after the catalyst has been in use for several hundred hours.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for preparing lactams by cyclizing hydrolysis of amino nitriles with water in the gas phase on metal oxide catalysts, wherein the metal oxide catalysts used are compounds of the formula I:<br>
MQa(ROb)cOd in which<br>
M is Zr, Ti or Hf, R is P, As and/or Sb, Q is a metal from group 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10, a is a number from 0 to 0.1, b is a number from 0.5 to 5, c is a number from 0.001 to 0.15, and d has the magnitude necessary to achieve neufrality of charge, where R can also be S if a &gt; 0.001.<br>
