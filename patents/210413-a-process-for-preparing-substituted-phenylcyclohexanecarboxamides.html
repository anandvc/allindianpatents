COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"A PROCESS FOR PREPARING SUBSTITUTED PHENYLCYCLOHEXANECARBOXAMIDES"<br>
BAYER AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT, a German company, of D-51368, Leverkusen, Germany,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
The   present    invention    relates    to    a   process    for   preparing    substituted phenylcyclohexanecarboxamides<br>
The present invention relates to substituted phenylcyclohexanecarboxamides having adenosine-uptake-inhibiting action, to processes for their preparation and to their use in medicaments, in particular for treating ischaemic brain disorders.<br>
Adenosine is an endogenic effector with cell-protective activity, in particular under cell-damaging conditions with limited oxygen and substrate supply, such as, for example, in ischaemia, stroke and brain trauma. The neuroprotective action of adenosine is essentially effected via suppression of presynaptic glutamate release and limitation of postsynaptic depolarization. This prevents toxic calcium influx into postsynaptic nerve cells via NMDA receptors. Under ischaemic or hypoxic conditions, the extracellular concentration of adenosine in the CNS is dramatically increased.<br>
There are various indications of a neuroprotective, anticonvulsive, analgesic and sleep-inducing potential of adenosine-uptake inhibitors, since they enhance the intrinsic effects of adenosine by inhibiting its cellular reuptake. Accordingly, adenosine-uptake inhibitors can be administered orally or intravenously for the prevention and treatment of cerebral ischaemia, stroke, reperfusion damage, brain trauma, oedema, spasms, epilepsy, respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest, Reye's syndrome, cerebral thrombosis, emboli, tumours, haemorrhages, encephalomyelitis, hydroencephalitis, spinal injuries, post-operative brain damage, injuries to the retina or the optical nerve after glaucoma, ischaemia, hypoxia, oedema or trauma and in the treatment of schizophrenia, sleep disturbances and pain (Cerebrovasc. Brain Metab. Rev. 1992, 4, 364-369; Drug Dev. Res. 1993, 28, 410-415; Science 1997, 276, 1265-1268; 'Adenosine in the Nervous System', Ed.: Trevor Stone, Academic Press Ltd. 1991,217-227; Ann Rep. Med. Chem. 1998, 33, 111-120).<br>
Adenosine-uptake inhibitors can also be employed for potentiating the effect of nucleobase, nucleoside or nucleotide antimetabolites in the chemotherapeutical treatment of cancer and antiviral (for example HIV) chemotherapy (Curr. Med. Chem. 1997,4,35-66).<br>
EP-A-0 611 767 and EP-A-0 725 064 disclose phenylcyclohexylcarboxamides which can be used for treating atherosclerosis and/or restenosis.<br><br><br>

Owing to their improved solubility in water, the compounds according to the invention are particularly suitable for intravenous administration.<br>
Test systems<br>
1.        Determination of the solubility<br>
To determine the solubility, a precipitation method was used:<br>
10 mg of the test substance are completely dissolved in 50 µl of DMSO (stock solution). 20 ul of this solution are added to 2000 ul of physiological saline. This<br><br><br>
solution, in turn, is shaken at 25°C in a Thermomixer Comfort (from Eppendorf) at 1400 rpm for 24 hours for equilibration.<br>
The precipitated fractions of the test substance are centrifuged off using a Biofuge 15 from Heraeus at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. 1300 µl of the supernatant are once more centrifuged using a Microfuge from Beckmann at 45,000 rpm = 125,000 g.<br>
10 \x\ of this centrifugation supernatant are then diluted with 1000 µl of DMSO, and this solution is measured by HPLC (Hewlett Packard 1090, method, gradient from 100% PBS buffer pH = 4 to 10% buffer/90% acetonitrile over a period of 15 min, column: RP18; PBS buffer pH = 4 is a physiological saline solution adjusted to pH = 4 using phosphate buffer).<br>
Using a calibration curve, the measured peak area of the HPLC measurement is converted into substance concentration. For the calibration curve, 20 µl of the stock solution are diluted successively with DMSO such that 5 concentrations of 2.5 mg/1 to 2000 mg/1 result. These solutions are likewise measured by HPLC (see method above), and the peak areas are plotted as a function of the concentrations.<br>
The solubility, determined by this method, of Examples 3 and 5 is 176 and 16 mg/1, respectively.<br>
2.        Binding of the compounds according to the invention to an adenosine transport protein from calf cortex<br>
The ability of substances, to influence the adenosine uptake system is investigated firstly by determining the binding affinity of selected substances to an adenosine transport protein of the CNS and secondly by determining the inhibiting effect of the substances on functional adenosine uptake.<br>
For the binding test, a membrane preparation of cerebral calf cortex is used, which expresses the relevant adenosine transporter. The binding affinity (Ki value) is determined by measuring the displacement of a specific radio-labelled ligand [nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBTI)] from the binding site in question by test substances. The binding site is the binding site on the transport protein which is relevant for the actual transport process. Thus, binding of test substances in this experiment results in<br><br>
a quantifiable release of bound radioactive NBTI which makes determination of the Ki value possible. (J. Neurochemistry 1982,39,184-191).<br>
Examples 3 and 5 inhibit NBTI-binding, in each case with Kj=2 nM.<br>
3.	Inhibition   of   adenosine   uptake   in   calf   cortex   synaptosomes   by<br>
compounds according to the invention<br>
For the functional adenosine uptake test, a synaptosome preparation from cerebral calf cortex is used which expresses the adenosine transporter in question. Synaptosomes are cell-free, functionally active vesicles which are obtained from cortex tissue using sheer forces and which still have the properties of an intact synaptic knob. The inhibitory activity (IC50 value) is determined by measuring the inhibition of the uptake of the specific radio-labelled "substrate" adenosine into the synaptosomes (J. Neurochemistry 1990, 55, 541-550).<br>
Examples 3 and 5 inhibit adenosine uptake into synaptosomes with IC50 = 8 nM and 14 nM, respectively.<br>
The neuroprotective activity of the compounds according to the invention was determined in the animal model of transient occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (tMCA-O) and the subdural haematoma (SDH).<br>
4.	tMCA-O<br>
This rodent model (rat) imitates the pathophysiology and cerebral pathology of stroke or circulatory arrest (embolization, thrombosis, vaso spasm, cardiac arrest, rapidly and dramatically reduced blood pressure, high blood loss, etc.) with subsequent recirculation in man (modified according to: J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1997, 17, 1066-1073).<br>
Under general anaesthesia (inhalation anaesthesia with isoflurane), the hairs in the lower anterior neck region are shaved off, in the dorsal position, the head is fixed, the skin is disinfected and the neck area is opened in the middle along the trachea. The right lateral neck muscles are severed bluntly and, together with the skin, pulled to the side (retractors) so that the common carotid artery is clearly visible. The common carotid artery is exposed towards the head up to the point where it branches into the internal carotid artery and the external carotid artery. Using surgical suture material,<br><br><br>
the common carotid artery (near the thorax) and the external carotid artery are tied off. Using a microclamp, the internal carotid artery is closed temporarily. The common carotid artery is opened, and a nylon monofilament with a rounded tip and a silicone cylinder of a length of 1 cm are passed through the common carotid artery and, after opening of the microclamp; further through the internal carotid artery, to close the exit of the middle cerebral artery. Using two temporary suture loops, the filament is fixed in the internal carotid artery. After one hour, the filament is pulled out, and the internal carotid artery and the common carotid artery are tied off above the opening. Blood is supplied via the contralateral muscular system.<br>
Substance administration is begun directly with the start of reperfusion. The operation wound is surgically looked after. During the operation and the administration of the substance (infusion), the body temperature is kept constant using a heating plate.<br>
After 2 days of post-operative survival, the volume of the cerebral infarct is determined with the aid of a computer-supported image analysis system using preproduced series of histological brain sections. The size of the infarct is evaluated differentially by cortex, striatum, hippocampus and other brain areas.<br>
At a dose of 0.001 mg/(kg x h) (i.v. infusion), Examples 3 and 5 reduce the infarct volume by 81 and 91%, respectively, in comparison to control animals.<br>
5.	Subdural haematoma in rats (SDH)<br>
This rodent model (rat) imitates pathophysiology and cerebral pathology of the blunt skull-brain trauma with subdural haemorrhage and development of a subdural haematoma in man. (Neurosurgery 1990, 27, 433-439).<br>
Under anaesthesia, the animals are unilaterally injected subdurally with their own blood. Under the haematoma, an infarct forms. The substance is administered according to different schedules and via different administration routes (i.v., i.p.). The size of the infarct is determined as described in the model of the transient focal ischaemia in rats (tMCA-O).<br>
At a dose of 0.001 mg/(kg x h) (i.v. infusion), Examples 3 and 4 reduce the infarct volume by 30 and 45%, respectively, in comparison to control animals.<br><br><br>
The novel active compounds can be converted in a known manner into the customary formulations, such as tablets, coated tablets, pills, granules, aerosols, syrups, emulsions, suspensions and solutions, using inert, nontoxic, pharmaceutically suitable carriers or solvents. In this case the therapeutically active compound should in each case be present in a concentration of about 0.0001 to 90% by weight, preferably 0.0001 to 1.0% by weight, of the total mixture, i.e. in amounts which are sufficient in order to achieve the dosage range indicated.<br>
The formulations are prepared, for example, by extending the active compounds with solvents and/or excipients, if appropriate using emulsifiers and/or dispersants, where, for example, if the diluent used is water, organic solvents can optionally be used as auxiliary solvents.<br>
Administration is carried out in a customary mariner, preferably orally, transdermally or parenterally, in particular perlingually or intravenously.<br>
In general, it has proven advantageous in the case of intravenous administration to administer amounts of approximately 0.00001 to 10 mg/kg, preferably approximately 0.0001 to 1 mg/kg, of body weight to achieve effective results.<br>
In spite of this, if appropriate, it may be necessary to depart from the amounts mentioned, namely depending on the body weight or the type of administration route, on the individual response to the medicament, the manner of its formulation and the time or interval at which administration takes place. Thus, in some cases it may be adequate to manage with less than the abovementioned minimum amount, while in other cases the upper limits mentioned must be exceeded. In the case of the administration of relatively large amounts, it may be advisable to divide these into several individual doses over the course of the day.<br>

Racemic (lR*,2R*)-2-(4-methyl-phenyl)-cyclohexane-l-carboxylic acid was prepared analogously to the process described in US-A-5,395,840, column 16. The resulting racemic material was separated into the enantiomers using the following procedure:<br>
The racemic acid (415 g; 1.9 mol) and triethylamine (96.2 g; 0.95 mol; 131.8 ml) were suspended in a mixture of THF (2.7 1) and water (5.3 1). At 60°C, S-(-))-phenylethylamine (115.2 g; 0.95 mol) was added dropwise, resulting in a precipitate being formed. The mixture was stirred at 60°C for 2 h and then cooled using an ice-bath. The precipitate was filtered off with suction, giving predominantly the phenylethylamine salt of the (lS,2S)-enantiomer. The filtrate was acidified using cone. HC1 and extracted twice using dichloromethane. The combined extracts were dried over sodium sulphate and concentrated. Yield: 202.4 g (28%) of a mixture of enantiomers enriched with the (1R,2R)-isomer.<br>

After 2 h, the mixture was cooled to 0°C, adjusted to pH = 2 using aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (about 30 ml, 2M) and extracted with<br><br>
dichioromethane. Drying of the organic phase over sodium sulphate gave, after concentration, the compound of the general formula (V).<br>
General procedure for amide formation [C):<br>
A suspension of acid (V) (4 mmol), (S)-phenylglycinamide hydrochloride (4.2 mmol), 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (4.4 mmol), EDC hydrochloride (4.8 mmol) and triethylamine (12 mmol) in dichioromethane (40 ml) was stirred at room temperature for 24-48 h. Water was added, and the mixture was then extracted with dichioromethane (in some cases with methanol) and the organic phase was dried over sodium sulphate (or magnesium sulphate) and chromatographed (silica gel, dichloromethane:methanol). This gave the desired product in a yield of 60-80%.<br>
Analogously to procedure C, it is possible to employ phenylglycinol instead of phenylglycinamide.<br><br>
