The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
WO 2008/006716<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/056564<br><br>
- 1 -IMPROVEMENTS RELATING TO PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS<br>
Field of the Invention:<br>
5<br>
The present invention relates improvements relating to pharmaceutical compositions. In particular it relates to pharmaceutically active compositions and precursors therefor which contain a so-called "sartan" 10<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Angiotensin II is formed from Angiotensin I by angiotensin 15  converting enzyme (ACE).  Angiotensin II is a component of the renin-angiotensin system.  Angiotensin II receptor antagonists block the action of Angiotensin II.  The present invention is believed to be generally applicable to hydrophobic Angiotensin II receptor antagonists (sartans) 20  but will be described with particular reference to Valsartan.<br>
Valsartan and other Angiotensin II receptor antagonists (including Candesartan, Eprosartan, Ibresartan, Losartan,<br>
25  Olmesartan and Telmesartan) are primarily used for the treatment of hypertension, and are effective where the patient is intolerant of ACE inhibitor therapy. They do not inhibit the breakdown of kinins and therefore are less frequently associated with the persistent dry cough and/or<br>
30  other side effects that limit ACE inhibitor therapy. More recently, they have been used for the treatment of heart<br><br>

failure in patients intolerant of ACE inhibitor therapy, (particularly candesartan, Irbesartan and losartan). Many Sartans exhibit low water solubility and  are practically insoluble in water. This hinders their effective use. 5<br>
Our co-pending international patent application PCT/GB03/03226 describes the formation of solid, porous beads comprising a three dimensional open-cell lattice of a water-soluble polymeric material. These are typically<br>
10  'templated' materials formed by the removal of both water<br>
and a non-aqueous dispersed phase from a high internal phase emulsion (HIPE) which has a polymer dissolved in the aqueous phase. The beads are formed by dropping the HIPE emulsion into a low temperature fluid such as liquid nitrogen, then<br>
15  freeze-drying the particles formed to remove the bulk of the aqueous phase and the dispersed phase. This leaves- behind the polymer in the form of a 'skeletal' structure. The beads dissolve rapidly in water and have the remarkable property that a water-insoluble component dispersed in the dispersed<br>
20  phase of the emulsion prior to freezing and drying can also be dispersed in water on solution of the polymer skeleton of the beads.<br>
WO 2005/011636 discloses a non-emulsion based spray drying 25  process for forming 'solid amorphous dispersions' of drugs in polymers. In this method a polymer and a low-solubility drug are dissolved in a solvent and spray-dried to form dispersions in which the drug is mostly present in an amorphous form rather than in a crystalline form. 30<br><br>

Our co-pending applications GB 0501835 and GB 0613925 (filed 13th July 2006) describe how materials which will form a nano-dispersion in water can be prepared, preferably by a spray-drying process. In the first of these applications the 5  water insoluble materials is dissolved in the solvent-phase of an emulsion. In the second, the water-insoluble materials are dissolved in a mixed solvent system and co-exist in the same phase as a water-soluble structuring agent. In both cases the liquid is dried above ambient temperature (above<br>
10  20 Celsius), such as by spray drying, to produce particles of the structuring agent, as a carrier, with the water-insoluble materials dispersed therein. When these particles are placed in water they dissolve, forming a nano-dispersion of the water-insoluble material with particles typically<br>
15  below 300nm. This scale is similar to that of virus<br>
particles, and the water-insoluble material behaves as though it were in solution.<br>
WO 2006/074218 (Elan Pharma International Ltd) discloses 20  nanoparticulate forms of candesartan (particularly<br>
candisartan cilexitil). Particle sizes are disclosed from 2000nm down to 50nm. Methods for the production of these nanoparticles include grinding, milling, homogenisation, precipitation and supercritical gas methods. 25<br>
In the present application the term 'ambient temperature' means 20 degrees Celsius and all percentages are percentages by weight unless otherwise specified.<br>

We have now determined that both the emulsion-based and the single-phase method can be used to produce a water-soluble, nano-disperse form of a sartan.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the production of a composition comprising a water-insoluble sartan which comprises the steps of:'<br><br>
10  a)   providing a mixture comprising:<br>
i)   a water-insoluble sartan<br>
ii)  a water soluble carrier, 15<br>
iii) a solvent for each of the sartan and the carrier ,<br>
and<br>
20  b)   spray-drying the mixture to remove the or each solvent and obtain a substantially solvent-free nano-dispersion of the sartan in the carrier.<br>
The preferred method of particle sizing for the dispersed 25  products of the present invention employs a dynamic light scattering instrument (Nano S, manufactured by Malvern Instruments UK). Specifically, the Malvern Instruments Nano S uses a red (633nm) 4mW Helium-Neon laser to illuminate a standard optical quality UV curvette containing a suspension 30  of material. The particle sizes quoted in this application are those obtained with that apparatus using the standard<br>

Preferred water-insoluble sartans include Valsartan, 10  Candesartan, Eprosartan, Irbesartan, Losartan, Olmesartan, Telmesartan and water insoluble derivatives thereof.<br>
Preferred carrier materials are selected from the group consisting of:water-soluble inorganic materials, 15  surfactants, polymers and mixtures thereof.<br>
A further aspect.of the present invention provides a process for preparing a sartan composition comprising a water-insoluble sartan and a water-soluble carrier, which. 20  comprises the steps of:<br>
a)	forming an emulsion comprising:<br>
i)   a solution of the sartan in a water-immiscible<br>
25	solvent for the same, and<br>
ii)  an aqueous solution of the carrier, and,<br>
b)	drying the solution to remove water and the water-<br>

10  a)   providing a single phase mixture comprising:<br>
i)   at least one non-aqueous solvent<br>
ii)  optionally, water 15<br>
iii) a water-soluble carrier material soluble in the mixture of (i) and (ii) and<br>

product is less than 15%wt, preferably below 10%wt, more preferably below 5%wt and most preferably below 2%wt.<br>
In the context of the present invention it is essential that 5  both the carrier material and the sartan are essentially fully dissolved in their respective solvents prior to the drying step. It is not within the ambit of the present specification to teach the drying of slurries. For the avoidance of any doubt, it is therefore the case that the 10  solids content of the emulsion or the mixture is such that over 90%wt, preferably over 95%, and more preferably over 98% of the soluble materials present is in solution prior to the drying step.<br>
15  In relation to the methods mentioned above, the preferred sartan and the preferred carrier materials are as described above and as elaborated on in further detail below. Similarly the preferred physical characteristics of the material are as described above.<br>
20<br>
The 'single phase' method where both the sartan and the carrier material are dissolved in a phase comprising at least one other non-aqueous solvent (and optional water) is preferred. This is believed to be more efficacious in<br>
25  obtaining a smaller particle size for the nano-disperse<br>
sartan. Preferably, the drying step simultaneously removes both the water and other solvents and, more preferably, drying is accomplished by spray drying at above ambient temperature.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention:<br>
Various preferred features and embodiments of the present invention are described in further detail below.<br>
Sartans:<br>
As noted above the preferred water-insoluble Sartans are<br><br>
drugc otu watcM. iiiouluble. anti malaria-l drugs selected from the group consisting of Valsartan, Candesartan, Eprosartan, Irbesartan, Losartan, Olmesartan, Telmesartan and 25  derivatives and mixtures thereof. These can be present as the sole pharmaceutically active ingredient in compositions according to the present invention or be together with other drugs to provide a so-called ^combination therapy'.<br>
30  As an illustrative example, Irbesartan is also available in a combination formulation with a low dose thiazide diuretic,<br>

invariably hydrochlorothiazide, to achieve an additive antihypertensive effect. Irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination preparations are marketed under similar trade names to irbesartan preparations, including CoAprovel, 5  Karvezide, Avalide and  Avapro HCT.<br>
Water-Dispersible Product Form:<br>
The present invention provides a method for obtaining a 10  water-dispersible form of an otherwise water-insoluble<br>
material. This is prepared by forming a not wholly aqueous intermediate emulsion or solution in which both a water-soluble carrier material and the water insoluble sartan are dissolved. On removal of solvents the insoluble sartan is 15      left dispersed through the water-soluble carrier material. Suitable carrier materials are described in further details -below.<br>
The structure of the material obtained after the drying step 20  is not well understood. It is believed that the resulting dry materials are not encapsulates, as discrete macroscopic bodies of the water-insoluble materials are not present in the dry product. Neither are the dry materials dry emulsions' as little or none of the volatile solvent 25  comprising the 'oil' phase of the emulsion remains after the drying step. On addition of water to the dry product the emulsion is not reformed, as it would be with a Mry emulsion'. It is also believed that the compositions are not so-called solid solutions, as with the present invention the 30  ratios of components present can be varied without loss of the benefits. Also from X-ray and DSC studies, it is<br><br>
WO 2008/006716<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/056564<br><br>
-   11   -<br>
believed that the compositions of the invention are not solid solutions, but comprise nano-scale, phase-separated mixtures.<br>
5  Preferably, the compositions produced after the drying step will comprise the sartan and the carrier in a weight ratio of from 1:500 to 1:1 (as sartan:carrier), 1:100 to 1:1 being preferred. Typical levels of around 10-30%wt water-insoluble sartan and 90-70%wt carrier can be obtained by spray drying.<br>
10<br>
By the method of the present invention the particle size of the sartan materials can be reduced to below 100nm and may be reduced to around 15nm. Preferred particle sizes are in the range 40-15nm.<br>
15<br>
'Emulsion' Preparation Method:<br>
In one preferred method according to the invention the solvent for the water-insoluble sartanis not miscible with 20  water. On admixture with water it therefore can form an emulsion.<br>
Preferably, the non-aqueous phase comprises from about 10 % to about 95 % v/v of the emulsion, more preferably from 25  about 20 % to about 68 % v/v.<br>
The emulsions are typically prepared- under conditions which are well known to those skilled in the art, for example, by using a magnetic stirring bar, a homogeniser, or a 30  rotational mechanical stirrer. The emulsions need not be<br><br>
WO 2008/006716<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/056564<br><br>
-   12   -<br>
particularly stable, provided that they do not undergo extensive phase separation prior to drying.<br>
Homogenisation using a high-shear mixing device is a 5  particularly preferred way to make an emulsion in which the aqueous phase is the continuous phase. It is believed that this avoidance of coarse emulsion and reduction of the droplet si2e of the dispersed phase of the emulsion, results in an improved dispersion of the 'payload' material in the 10  dry product.<br>
In a preferred method according to the invention a water-continuous emulsion is prepared with an average dispersed-phase droplet size (using the Malvern peak intensity) of 15  between 500nm and 5000nm. We have found that an 'Ultra-Turrux' T25 type laboratory homogenizer (or equivalent) gives a suitable emulsion when operated for more than a minute at above 10,000 rpm.<br>
20  There is a directional relation between the emulsion droplet size and the size of the particles of the 'payload' material, which can be detected after dispersion of the materials of the invention in aqueous solution. We have determined that an increase in the speed of homogenization<br>
25  for precursor emulsions can decrease final particle size after re-dissolution.<br>
It is believed that the re-dissolved particle size can be reduced by nearly one half when the homogenization speed 30  increased from 13,500 rpm to 21,500 rpm. The homogenization time is also believed to play a role in controlling re-<br><br>
WO 2008/006716<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/056564<br><br>
-   13   -<br>
dissolved particle size. The particle size again decreases with increase in the homogenization time, and the particle size distribution become broader at the same time.<br>
5  Sonication is also a particularly preferred way of reducing the droplet size for emulsion systems. We have found that a Hert Systems Sonicator XL operated at level 10 for two minutes is suitable.<br>
10  It is believed that ratios of components which decrease the relative concentration of the anti-parasitic to the solvents and/or the carrier give a smaller particle size.<br>
'Single Phase'  Preparation Method:<br>
15<br>
In an alternative method according to the present invention both the carrier and the sartan are soluble in a non-aqueous solvent or a mixture of such a solvent with water.  Both here and elsewhere in the specification the non-aqueous<br>
20  solvent can be a mixture of non-aqueous solvents.<br>
In this case the feedstock of the drying step can be a single phase material in which both the water-soluble carrier and the water-insoluble sartan are dissolved. It is 25  also possible for this feedstock to be an emulsion, provided that both the carrier and the sartan are dissolved in the same phase.<br>
The 'single-phase' method is generally believed to give a 30  better nano-dispersion with a smaller particle size than the emulsion method.<br><br>
WO 2008/006716<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/056564<br><br>
-   14   -<br>
It is believed that ratios of components which decrease the relative concentration of the sartan to the solvents and/or the carrier give a smaller particle size. 5  Drying:<br>
Spray drying is well known to those versed in the art. In the case of the present invention some care must be taken due to the presence of a volatile non-aqueous solvent in the<br>
10  emulsion being dried. In order to reduce the risk of<br>
explosion when a flammable solvent is being used, an inert gas, for example nitrogen, can be employed as the drying medium in a so-called closed spray-drying system. The solvent can be recovered and re-used. <br>
15<br>
We have found that the 'Buchi' B-290 type laboratory spray drying apparatus is suitable.<br>
It is preferable that the drying temperature should be at or 20  above 100 Celsius, preferably above 120 Celsius and most preferably above 140 Celsius. Elevated drying temperatures have been found to give smaller particles in the re-dissolved nano-disperse material.<br>
25  Carrier Material:<br>
The carrier material is water soluble, which includes the formation of structured aqueous phases as well as true ionic solution of molecularly mono-disperse species. The carrier 30  material preferably comprises an inorganic material.<br><br>

5  Non-aqueous solvent:<br>
The compositions of the invention comprise a volatile, second non-aqueous solvent. This may either be miscible with the other solvents in pre-mix before drying or, together 10  with those solvents may form an emulsion.<br>
In one alternative form of the invention	a single, non¬<br>
aqueous solvent is employed in which can	form a single phase<br>
with water in the presence of the sartan	and the carrier.<br>
15  Preferred solvents for these embodiments	are polar, protic<br>
or aprotic solvents. Generally preferred	solvents have a<br>
dipole moment greater than 1 and a dielectric constant<br>
greater than 4.5.<br>
20  Particularly preferred solvents are selected from the group consisting of haloforms (preferably dichloromethane, chloroform), lower (C1-C10) alcohols (preferably methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, isobutanol), organic acids (preferably formic acid, acetic acid), amides (preferably formamide,<br>
25  N,N-dimethylformamide), nitriles (preferably aceto-nitrile), esters (preferably ethyl acetate) aldehydes and ketones (preferably methyl ethyl ketone, acetone), and other water miscible species comprising hetroatom bond with a suitably large dipole (preferably tetrahydrofuran,<br>

PCT/EP2007/056564<br><br>
~   21   -<br>
Haloforms, lower alcohols, ketones and dialkylsulphoxides are the most preferred solvents.<br>
In another alternative form of the invention the non-aqueous 5  solvent is not miscible with water and forms an emulsion.<br>
The non-aqueous phase of the emulsion is preferably selected from one or more from the following group of volatile organic solvents: 10<br>
•	alkanes, preferably heptane, n-hexane, isooctane,<br>
dodecane, decane;<br>

WO 2008/006716<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/0S6564<br><br>
-   22   -<br>
Preferred solvents include dichloromethane, chloroform, ethanol, acetone and dimethyl sulphoxide.<br>
Preferred non-aqueous solvents, whether miscible or not have 5  a boiling point of less than 150 Celsius and, more<br>
preferably, have a boiling point of less than 100 Celsius, so as to facilitate drying, particularly spray-drying under practical conditions and without use of specialised equipment. Preferably they are non-flammable, or have a 10  flash point above the temperatures encountered in the method of the invention.<br>
Preferably, the non-aqueous solvent comprises from about 10 % to about 95 % v/v of any emulsion formed, more 15  preferably from about 20 % to about 80 % v/v. In the single phase method the level of solvent is preferably 20-100%v/v.<br>
Particularly preferred solvents are alcohols, particularly ethanol and halogenated solvents, more preferably chlorine-20  containing solvents, most preferably solvents selected from (di- or tri- chloromethane).<br>
Optional Cosurfactant:<br>
25  In addition to the non-aqueous solvent an optional<br>
co-surfactant may be employed in the composition prior to the drying step. We have determined that the addition of a relatively small quantity of a volatile cosurfactant reduced the particle diameter of the material produced. This can<br>
30  have a significant impact on particle volume. For example,<br>
reduction from 297nm to 252nm corresponds to a particle size<br><br>
WO 2008/006716<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/056564<br><br>
-   23   -<br>
reduction of approximately 40%. Thus, the addition of a small quantity of co-surfactant offers a simple and inexpensive method for reducing the particle size of materials according to the present invention without 5  changing the final product formulation.<br>
Preferred co-surfactants are short chain alcohols or amine with a boiling point of 
( 10  Preferred co-surfactants are linear alcohols.  Preferred<br>
co-surfactants are primary alcohols and amines.<br>
Particularly preferred co-surfactants are selected from the<br>
group consisting of the 3-6 carbon alcohols. Suitable<br>
alcohol co-surfactants include n-propanol, n-butanol,<br>
15  n-pentanol, n-hexanol, hexylamine and mixtures thereof. Preferably the co-surfactant is present in a quantity (by volume) less than the solvent preferably the volume ratio between the solvent and the co-surfactant falls in the range 100:40 to 100:2, more preferably 100:30 to 100:5.<br>
20<br>
Preferred Spray-Drying Feedstocks:	(<br>
Typical spray drying feedstocks comprise:<br>

PCT/EP2007/056564<br><br>
-   24   -<br>
d)	a  polymer,   and,<br>
e)	optional water<br>
5  Preferred spray-drying feedstocks comprise:<br>
a)	at least one non-aqueous solvent selected from<br>
dichloromethane, chloroform, ethanol, acetone,  and<br>
mixtures thereof,<br>
10<br>
b)	a surfactant selected from PEG co-polymer nonionic's<br>
(especially the PEG/PPG PluronicTM materials), alkyl<br>
sulphonates (especially SDS), ester surfactants<br>
(preferably sorbitan esters of the -Span™ and Tween™<br>
15       types) and cationics (especially cetyltrimethylammonium bromide - CTAB) and mixtures thereof, .<br>
c)	more than 0.1% of at least one water-insoluble sartan,<br>
20  d)   a polymer selected from Polyethylene glycol (PEG),<br>
Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyvinyl-pyrrolidone (PVP), hydroxypropyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl-methyl cellulose (HPMC) , alginates and mixtures thereof, and<br>
25  e)   optionally water.<br>
The drying feed-stocks used in the present invention are either emulsions or solutions which preferably do not 30  contain any solid matter and in particular preferably do not contain any undissolved sartan.<br><br>
WO 2008/006716<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/056S64<br><br>
-   25   -<br>
It is particularly preferable that the level of the sartan in the composition should be such that the loading in the dried composition is below 40%wt, and more preferably below 5  30%wt. Such compositions have the advantages of a small particle size and high effectiveness as discussed above.<br>
10<br>
Water-Dispersed Form:<br>
On admixture of the water-soluble carrier material with<br>
15  water, the carrier dissolves and the water-insoluble sartan is dispersed through the water in sufficiently fine form that it behaves like a soluble material in many respects. The particle size of the water-insoluble materials in the dry product is preferably such that, on solution in water<br>
20  the water-insoluble materials have a particle size of less than 1 micron as determined by the Malvern method described herein. It is believed that there is no significant reduction of particle size for the sartan on dispersion of the solid form in water.<br>
25<br>
By applying the present invention significant levels of ^water-insoluble' materials can be brought into a state which is largely equivalent to true solution. When the dry product is dissolved in water it is possible to achieve<br>
30  optically clear solutions comprising more than 0.1%,<br><br>

preferably more than 0,5% and more preferably more than 1% of the water-insoluble material.<br>
It is envisaged that the solution form will be a form 5  suitable for administration to a patient either 'as is' or following further dilution. In the alternative, the solution form of embodiments of the invention may be combined with other active materials to yield a medicament suitable for use in combination therapy. 10<br>
EXAMPLES:<br>
In order that the present invention may be further understood and carried forth into practice it is further 15  described below with reference to non-limiting examples.<br>
Examples 1-20:<br>
Pre-mixes for spray drying were made up as in table 1 below.<br>
20  The formulations were spray dried using a BUCHI Mini B-290 spray dryer with solids dissolved in 20ml ethanol and 10ml water. In all cases a clear solution was obtained which yielded a dry white powder after spray drying with a fixed pump rate of 10% (~3.6ml/min).<br>

For each sample (unless stated otherwise), about 10 mg powder was re-dispersed into 10 ml distilled water at room temperature (21.5 °C) to give a lmg/ml nano-dispersion for 10  particle size measurements.<br>
A method of particle sizing for the dispersed products of the present invention used in the following examples employs<br><br>

a dynamic light scattering instrument (Nano S, manufactured by Malvern Instruments UK). Specifically, the Malvern Instruments Nano S uses a red (633nm) 4mW Helium-Neon laser to illuminate a standard optical quality UV curvette 5  containing a suspension of material.<br>
Example 21:<br>
The formulation of example 14 was scaled up to produce more 10  material in order to conduct a dissolution study.<br>
A dose of valsartan (800mg of the product equivalent to 80mg of valsartan) was added to a 1000ml of de-ionised water, incubated at 360C' and stirred at a constant 50rpm. Aliquots<br>
15  of the dissolving mixture were removed at various times,<br>
filtered through .a lOOOnm syringe filter. Equal volumes of the filtered aqueous mixture and ethanol were mixed to form a single phase solution of the dissolved drug and excipients.<br>
20<br>
The UV absorbance maxima for valsartan in a 50/50 ethanol/water mixture had previously been determined as 204nm. However, this region of the UV spectrum is very sensitive to small changes in pH leading to large errors in<br>
25  the readings. As such, a wavelength of 257nm corresponding to a shoulder in the main valsartan absorbance spectra was used to construct a UV calibration graph for active concentration.<br>
30  The aliquots recovered from the dissolution test were then examined at this wavelength and an active concentration<br><br>

Examples 22-27:<br>
Formulations were produced based on a range of excipients, 10  active loadings, and process conditions. The excipients were chosen from hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPc, Mw 80K, Aldrich), polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP k3Q, Aldrich)r   hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC, Mw 10k, 6cps, Aldrich), polyethylene glycol (PEG, Mw 6,000, Fluka), Tween 80 (Aldrich), and 15  pluronic F127 (Aldrich).<br>
Active loadings varied from 10 wt% to 30 wt%, and the spray dry temperature varied from 140 °C to 190 °C.<br><br>
