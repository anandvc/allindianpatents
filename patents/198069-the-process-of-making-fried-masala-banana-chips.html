PROCESS FOR MAKING FRIED MASALA BANANA CHIPS<br>
Introduction :<br>
This invention relates to a food product and the process of making it. Particularly this invention is related to the process of making Tried Masala Banana Chips'.<br>
Prior-art :<br>
There are some edible chips of banana available in the Indian markets. In India, State of Kerala is famous for manufacturing and marketing a special variety of banana chips made-up of a distinct kind of banana, called as 'Nendra Bale'. But the above stated banana chips are mixed with only salt. Of course, different varieties of potato chips are available in Indian market as well as abroad.<br>
This invention relates to totally a special kind of fried banana chips which is spicy and of great taste, no where produced in any part of India. This product is unique novel and serve taste to one and all.<br>
There are agriculturists who would get least prices for their products. Earlier bananas in Karnataka are used only for the purpose of eating that too ripe bananas only. Growers of banana would hardly get proper returns for their products. In this situation we thought we should help the growers of banana to the best of our  ability.<br><br>
Then the idea of manufacturing special kind of banana chips evolved in the minds of my father and myself. This resulted in finding out the above stated, "FRIED BANANA CHIPS OF SPECIAL TASTE OF PEPPER MASALA" Hence the interests of both inventors and agriculturists / growers are to be saved. We firmly hope that our product may be useful to me and all in the society at large.<br>
Details of my invention :<br>
The process of making the "FRIED MASALA BANANA CHIPS" of special taste of pepper masala is very hygiene is carried but in and the product is healthy for consumption. The oil content in the said chips is very very limited. This product is fit for consumption by all age group of socio-cultural groups. It would not be braggart if we say that the taste of the banana chips processed and made in the aforesaid manner would keep one in good health what consumed the very purpose of inventing and making the banana chips as stated supra is to give to the mankind a good edible food product so that the society as well as the inventors and agriculturists are benefitted.<br>
The speciality and uniqueness lies in process of making the masala to be mixed with the fried banana chips. There is also inventive step in selecting raw bananas, cutting the same into thin chips and then frying. The masala (composition of processed spices and other substances) used for making our product is not a mere admixture of some substances. The very process to arrive at a great spicy taste came to be   unforgettable taste in banana chips. We earnestly thought that<br><br>
our effort of so many years should be protected by the laws of our country.<br>
The method/nature of my invention :<br>
The Process of manufacturing the Banana chips and the composition there of can be detailed as follows :<br>
First we select pepper and dry that in the open sun for five to seven days or in the drier if there is any moisture. After the pepper is dried we grate / grind the same into nice powder. Then we select good salt especially table salt and dry the same if that contains moisture and then we make the said salt into nice powder. On completion of the said two process, we collect good quality black salt and convert the same into nice powder. Sometimes we also used dried Jeera chilly (small chilly available in malnad or western ghats of Karnatataka) and convert the same into nice powder, i.e.,one thousand grams of pepper powder with two hundred and fifty grams of take salt and five hundreds grams of black salt and also some times fifty grams of Jeera chilly as stated above. Though we make generally this combination/composition, we alter the same by some variations with respect to composition and relative proportion of each ingredients in the masala mix according to the needs of the consumers preference. Keeping this in mind the present invention is performed in ten different embodiments.<br><br>
