BEVERAGE PRECURSOR AND PROCESS FOR THE MANUFACTURE THEREOF<br>
HINDUSTAN UNILEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under<br>
the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office<br>
at 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br>
14 JAN 2009<br><br>
BEVERAGE PRECURSOR AMD PROCESS FOR THE MANUFACTURE THEREOF<br>
Technical Field of the Invention<br>
The present  invention  relates  to  beverage  precursors  for 5  preparing tea-based beverages.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Green tea is a popular beverage which has been consumed in China and Japan for many hundreds of years.  Recently,  extensive<br>
10 laboratory research and epidemiologic studies have shown that compounds present in green tea (particularly catechins) may reduce the risk of a variety of illnesses. Furthermore, catechins have been shown to suppress accumulation of visceral fat and so may be useful in controlling bodyweight and bodyshape (see, for<br>
15 example, T. Nagao et al., "Tea Catechins Suppress Accumulation of Body Fat in Humans", J. Oleo. Sci., 2001, 50(9), pp.717-728). These studies, along with the increasing complexity of the consumer's palate have led to growth in the consumption of green tea, even in markets (such as the USA and Western Europe) where<br>
20  there is no tradition of green tea consumption.<br>
Although, some of the health benefits of tea may be apparent at consumption rates as low as three cups per day (see, for example, U.Peters et al., "Does tea affect cardiovascular disease? A meta-<br>
25 analysis.", American Journal of Epidemiology, 2001, 154, pp.495-503), many individuals do not even achieve this modest consumption rate on a long term basis. Furthermore, tea beverages are less convenient to prepare than beverages prepared from non-tea-based beverage precursors, such as instant coffee, owing to<br>
30 the relatively slow rate of infusion of tea leaves and slow rate of dissolution of tea powders.<br><br>
Thus we have recognised that there is a need to provide beverage precursor in a form which is both convenient for everyday use and which may allow a consumer to obtain the necessary intake of catechins from a fewer number of beverages than would need to be 5  prepared from conventional beverage precursors.<br>
We have found that such a need may be met by providing beverage precursor in a specific amount and with a specific composition. We have also recognised that there is a need for a process 10  specifically adapted to manufacture such a beverage precursor.<br>
Tests and Definitions<br>
BEVERAGE<br>
As used herein the term "beverage" refers to a substantially 15  aqueous drinkable composition suitable for human consumption.<br>
BEVERAGE PRECURSOR<br>
A beverage precursor is defined as a fabricated composition suitable for preparing a beverage. 20<br>
As used herein, the term "packaged" means that the beverage precursor is contained within a sealed packet.<br>
TEA MATERIAL<br>
25 As used herein, the term "tea material" refers to dry material from the plant Camellia sinensis var. sinensis and/or Camellia sinensis var. assamica. The material may have been subjected to a so-called "fermentation" step wherein it is oxidised by certain endogenous enzymes that are released during the early stages of<br>
30 "black tea" manufacture. This oxidation may even be supplemented by the action of exogenous enzymes such as oxidases, laccases and peroxidases.  Alternatively the material may have been partially<br><br>
fermented ("oolong" tea) or substantially unfermented ("green tea").<br>
The term "tea leaves and/or stem" refers to tea material that is 5 derived from the leaves and/or stem of the plant, and that has not been subjected to an extraction step (i.e., infusible tea material) . The term "tea extract' refers to tea material that has been extracted from tea leaves and/or stem, and which is soluble in boiling water.<br>
10<br>
TEA-BASED BEVERAGE<br>
As used herein, the term "tea-based beverage" refers to a beverage comprising at least 0.01% by weight dissolved tea material.<br>
15<br>
FOOD-GRADE ADDITIVE<br>
As used herein, the term "food-grade additive" refers to edible<br>
material that is not derived from a plant of the species Camellia<br>
sinensis.<br>
20<br>
CATECHINS<br>
As used herein the term "catechins" is us^d as a generic term for catechin, gallocatechin, catechin gallate, gallocatechin gallate, epicatechin,     epigallocatechin,     epicatechin     gallate,<br>
2 5  epigallocatechin gallate, and mixtures thereof.<br>
DETERMINATION OF CATECHINS AND CAFFEINE IN TEA MATERIAL<br>

DETERMINATION OF CATECHINS AND CAFFEINE IN A BEVERAGE PRODUCED BY<br>
CONTACTING BEVERAGE PRECURSOR WITH 250 ml WATER AT 90°C FOR 2<br>
MINUTES<br>
The amounts of catechins and caffeine delivered by a beverage<br>
precursor are determined simultaneously by reverse-phase HPLC as<br>
follows:<br><br>
Sample Preparation<br>
1.	For beverage precursor contained in an infusion package, the<br>
whole infusion package is placed in a 500 ml container. For<br>
beverage precursor not in an infusion package,  the beverage<br>
5 precursor is removed from any package and placed in a 500 ml container.<br>
2.	1 litre of deionised water is then brought to boiling and 250<br>
g immediately added to the 500 ml container.<br>
3.	The container is stored at an air temperature of 20°C and the<br>
0  beverage precursor is allowed to statically infuse/dissolve in<br>
the water.<br>
4.	After 2 minutes, remaining beverage precursor is	removed from<br>
the container. In the case of a beverage precursor	contained in<br>
an infusion package, the infusion package is simply	removed from<br>
5 the liquid in the container. In the case of beverage precursor not in an infusion package, the liquid is strained through muslin.<br>
5.	9 ml of the liquid are then taken and 1.12 ml of acetonitrile<br>
added, along with 1.12 ml of a solution of 2.5 mg/ml EDTA and 2.5<br>
0  mg/ml ascorbic acid in distilled water.<br>
6.	The resulting solution is then decanted into microcentrifuge<br>
tubes and centrifuged at a RCF of 14000 g for 10 minutes.<br>
HPLC Analysis conditions 5  The HPLC analysis conditions are identical to those given above for the tea material.<br><br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
In a first aspect, the present invention provides a beverage precursor comprising tea material and food-grade additive, the beverage precursor being present in an amount wherein if the 5 beverage precursor is contacted with 250 ml water for 2 minutes at 90°C a beverage would be produced comprising catechins in an amount of between 0.05 and 2% by weight of the beverage.<br>
The beverage precursor of the invention is provided in an amount 10 that allows for consumers to meet the daily intake of catechins required to achieve health benefits, whilst requiring shorter time to prepare a beverage and/or preparation of fewer beverages per day compared with conventional beverage precursors.<br>
15 The efficiency of catechin delivery may be further improved if the beverage precursor is present in an amount wherein the contact of the beverage precursor with 250 ml water for 2 minutes at 9Q°C produces a beverage comprising catechins in an amount of at least 0.06% by weight of the beverage, more preferably at<br>
20 least 0.07% and most preferably at least 0.08%. The efficiency of catechin delivery should not be too high, however, otherwise the taste and/or appearance of the beverage may be impaired. Therefore it is preferred that the beverage precursor is present in an amount wherein contact of the beverage precursor with 250<br>
25 ml water for 2 minutes at 90°C produces a beverage comprising catechins in an amount of less than 1% by weight of the beverage, more preferably less than 0.5% and most preferably less than 0.2%.<br>
30 The mass of beverage precursor required to deliver suitable amounts of catechins to a beverage will depend upon the catechin content of the beverage precursor and on the solubility of the<br><br>
catechins in the aqueous medium used to prepare the beverage. It is preferred, however, that the mass of beverage precursor is at least 0.5 g, as smaller amounts are difficult to accurately portion and dose. More preferably the mass is at least 0.7 g, and 5 most preferably at least 0.9 g. Preferably also, the mass of beverage precursor is less than 5 g as larger amounts become inconvenient to store and/or handle. More preferably the mass is less than 4 g, most preferably less than 3 g.<br>
10 In order to provide maximum rate of infusion and/or dissolution of the tea material, it is preferred that the tea material is particulate. Preferably also, at least 95% (more preferably from 98 to 100%) by weight of the particulate tea material has a maximum linear dimension of less than 2 mm. In particular, it is<br>
15 preferred that at least 95% (more preferably from 98 to 100%) by weight of the particulate tea material has a mesh size below 9 (i.e. passes through a Tyler Mesh of No. 9).<br>
Green tea contains a higher level of catechins than semi-20 fermented tea or fermented tea and so it is preferred that the tea material comprises green tea material. More preferably the tea material comprises at least 75% by weight green tea material, most preferably from 90 to 100%.<br>
25 The tea material preferably comprises a high level of catechins, thus it is preferred that the tea material comprises at least 10% catechins by weight of the tea material, more preferably at least 12% and most preferably at least 13%. It is also preferred, however, that the tea material comprises further compounds that<br>
30 deliver the taste and benefits of tea and so it is preferred that the level of catechins in the tea material is less than 90% by<br><br>
weight of the tea material, more preferably less than 70% and most preferably less than 30%. These further compounds include theaflavins, thearubigins, gallic acid, theanine, caffeine, quinic acid, oxalic acid, potassium ions, sodium ions, magnesium 5 ions, aluminium ions, sucrose, glucose, maltose, fructose, pectin, or mixtures thereof.<br>
Caffeine is particularly preferred as it has been shown to assist in body management, especially in weight control and/or control<br>
10 of body shape. Thus it is preferred that the tea material comprises caffeine in an amount of at least 1% by weight of the tea material, more preferably at least 2% and most preferably at least 3%. Too much caffeine, however, may result in an unpalatable beverage and/or unwanted physiological effects. Thus<br>
15 it is also preferred that the tea material comprises less than 25% caffeine by weight of the tea material, more preferably less than 15% and most preferably less than 7%.<br>
To provide maximum benefit from the catechins and caffeine in<br>
20  terms of body management, it is preferred that the amount of<br>
beverage precursor  is  such that the beverage produced by<br>
contacting the beverage precursor with 250 ml water for 2 minutes<br>
at 90°C, comprises caffeine in an amount of between 0.005 and<br>
0.5% by weight of the beverage, more preferably between 0.01 and<br>
25  0.2% and most preferably between 0.015 and 0.1%. Preferably also,<br>
the amount of beverage precursor is such that the beverage<br>
produced by contacting the beverage precursor with 250 ml water<br>
for 2 minutes at 90°C has a weight ratio of catechins to caffeine<br>
of less than 6:1, more preferably in the range 4.9:1 to 1:1, most<br>
30  preferably between 4.5:1 and 2:1.<br><br><br>
The beverage precursor of the present invention comprises food grade additive. The presence of the food-grade additive may help in providing high efficiency of catechin delivery to a beverage. This is because the food-grade additive may help to separate the 5 tea material and thus allow for increased rate of infusion and/or dissolution of the tea material. The food grade additive may additionally or alternatively help to mask the bitter taste associated with catechins. Thus it is preferred that the beverage precursor comprises tea material and food-grade additive in a<br>
10 weight ratio of less than 100:1, more preferably less than 50:1 and most preferably less than 30:1. However, in order to maximise the benefits and taste provided by the tea material, it is preferred that the weight ratio of tea material to food-grade additive in the precursor is at least 1:2, more preferably at<br>
15  least 2:1 and most preferably at least 5:1.<br>
The ability of the food-grade additive to separate the tea material and thus allow for increased rate of infusion and/or dissolution of the tea material is enhanced when the food-grade<br>
20 additive is particulate. Thus it is preferred that the food-grade additive is particulate. Preferably also, at least 95% (more preferably from 98 to 100%) by weight of the food-grade additive has a maximum linear dimension of less than 2 mm. In particular, it is preferred that at least 95% (more preferably from 98 to<br>
25 100%) by weight of the food-grade additive has a mesh size below 9 (i.e. passes through a Tyler Mesh of No. 9).<br>
The food-grade additive may be any edible material and may, for example, comprise saccharide (including sugars, oligosaccharides 30 and/or polysaccharides), salt, sweetener (including artificial sweeteners such as aspartame, sucralose, and/or acesulfame K), protein, milk powder, food acid (and/or a salt thereof), flavour<br><br>
or a mixture thereof. Particularly preferred are sugars, oligosaccharide, sweetener, salt and mixtures thereof, owing to their ability to mask the bitterness of catechins.<br>
5 Suitable flavours include natural and synthetic fruit flavours, and/or natural or synthetic herb flavours. Examples of fruit flavours include apple, peach, pear, lemon, lime, mandarin, grapefruit, cranberry, orange, strawberry, grape, kiwi, pineapple, passion fruit, mango, guava, raspberry and cherry.<br>
10  Examples of herb flavours include jasmine, chamomile, rose, mint,<br>
hawthorn, chrysanthemum,  osmanthus,  hibiscus,  elderflower and<br>
verbena.  Surprisingly, we have found that pineapple flavour<br>
(natural or synthetic) is particularly effective at masking the<br>
bitterness of catechins, therefore it is particularly preferred<br>
15 that the flavour comprises pineapple flavour. The pineapple flavour may be natural or synthetic. Preferably the pineapple flavour comprises 2-propenyl hexanoate.<br>
The  food-grade  additive  may  additionally  or  alternatively 20 comprise   a   weight management   active.    Suitable   actives include biotin,  pantothenic acid  (vitamin B5),  vitamin B6,  niacin, magnesium, verba mate extract, guarana extract, hydroxycitric acid and mixtures thereof.<br>
25      The beverage precursor is preferably packaged in the said amount. The packet may be any suitable food-grade package.<br>
In one embodiment the packet is water-resistant. Suitable water-resistant materials are known in the art and include foil, waxed-30  paper and laminate materials. In this embodiment, the beverage precursor is removed from the packet in order to prepare a<br><br>
beverage. This embodiment is particularly preferred when the tea material is substantially free from tea leaf and/or stem. For example, the tea material may comprise at least 95% tea extract by weight of the tea material, more preferably at least 98% and 5  most preferably from 99.5 to 100%.<br>
In another embodiment the package is an infusion package. This embodiment is especially convenient when the tea material comprises tea leaf and/or stem. For an infusion package, the 10 packet is of porous material. The porous material can be any material that is suitable for enabling water to infuse within the packet without allowing any insoluble contents to leave the packet, for example filter paper, nylon mesh, gauze, muslin, nonwoven fabric or some other similar material or fabric.<br>
15<br>
The use of tea leaf and/or stem in the tea material is particularly preferred as tea leaf and/or stem is not produced with the intensive processing such as is involved in manufacture of tea extract. As a result, tea leaf and/or stem has a more 2 0 natural flavour and comprises a wider range of natural tea components than refined forms of tea material. Therefore, in a preferred embodiment, the tea material comprises tea leaf and/or stem in an amount of at least 90% by weight of the tea material, more preferably at least 95% and most preferably from 98 to 100%.<br>
25<br>
The tea leaf and/or stem is preferably green tea leaf and/or stem. Preferably also, the tea leaf and/or stem comprises catechins in an amount of at least 10% by weight of the leaf and/or stem, more preferably at least 12% and most between 13 and 30  25%.<br><br>
Of the two varieties of the tea plant Camellia sinensis, the variety Camellia sinensis var. assamica typically has the highest level of catechins. Furthermore, var. assamica is relatively rich in certain non-flavanol actives, such as the amino acid theanine. 5 However, because catechins have a large influence on the bitterness and astringency of tea infusions, var. assamica is conventionally considered unsuitable for use in green tea production (see, for example, "Tea: Cultivation to Consumption", K.C. Willson and M.N. Clifford (Eds), 1st Edn, 1992, Chapman &amp;<br>
10 Hall (London), Chapter 13, p. 414). We have found, however, that var. assamica is particularly suitable for providing the tea material of the present invention, especially as the food-grade additive may help to mask the bitterness of the catechins. Thus it is preferred that the tea leaf and/or stem comprises at least<br>
15 90% by weight of material from Camellia sinensis var. assamica, more preferably at least 95% and most preferably from 98 to 100%.<br>
Conventional manufacture of tea leaf and/or stem involves a maceration step. Maceration involves wounding the leaves and/or<br>
2 0 stem prior to drying. The wounding is usually affected by rolling and/or crushing the leaves and/or stem i.e. to break down the plant tissue structure. In order to maximise this wounding and the amount of catechins released by the tea material, it is preferred that tea leaves and/or stem used in the beverage<br>
25 precursor of the present invention have been produced by a process wherein fresh tea leaves and/or stem are macerated by passing through a cutting machine. Most preferred is that the tea leaf and/or stem has been macerated using a CTC process. "CTC" comes from the words "crush, tear and curl". CTC machines and<br>
30 processes are well-known to those skilled in the art (see, for example, "Tea: Cultivation to Consumption', K.C. Willson and M.N. Clifford (Eds), 1st Edn, 1992, Chapman &amp; Hall (London), Chapter<br><br>
14, pp. 483-485). Even more preferred is maceration using a combination of a rotorvane and CTC process. Rotorvanes are also well-known to those skilled in the art and are also described in Chapter 14 of "Tea: Cultivation to Consumption" (especially pp. 5 486-487). Maceration with the combination of rotorvane and CTC processes results in good catechin delivery and provides the tea material in a granular form which is especially convenient for combining with food-grade additive. A particularly effective process involves macerating the tea leaf and/or stem with a 10  rotorvane followed by two passes through a CTC process.<br>
The tea material may comprise a mixture of tea leaves and/or stem with tea extract.<br>
15 The beverage precursor is preferably dry. In particular, it is preferred that the beverage precursor comprises less than 15% water by weight of the beverage precursor, more preferably less than 10% and most preferably from 5 to 0.1%.<br>
2 0 In a further aspect, the present invention provides a method of manufacturing a beverage comprising contacting the beverage precursor with an aqueous medium. Suitable amounts of aqueous medium range from 50 g to 1000 g, more preferably 150 g to 500 g, most preferably 175 g to 300 g. The aqueous medium preferably<br>
25 comprises at least 90% water by weight of the aqueous medium, more preferably at least 98%, most preferably from 99.8 to 100%.<br>
The beverage precursor of this invention and/or the beverage may<br>
be used as a medicament or in the preparation of a medicament. In<br>
30  particular, the beverage precursor and/or beverage may be used to<br>
provide any of the benefits associated with consumption of<br><br>
catechins such as treating and/or preventing cancer; and/or treating and/or preventing cardio-vascular disease. It is particularly preferred to use the beverage precursor and/or beverage for controlling the bodyweight and/or shape of an 5 individual. For example, the beverage precursor or beverage may be used in a method of providing at least one of these benefits to an individual, the method comprising administering to the individual the beverage. Preferably the beverage is administered orally.<br>
10 In a still further aspect, the present invention provides a process for manufacturing a beverage precursor comprising the steps of:<br>
a)	providing fresh tea leaf and/or stem; then<br>
b)	heat-treating the fresh leaf and/or stem to arrest 15       enzyme action; then<br><br>
c)	macerating the fresh leaf and/or stem with a rotorvane and at least one CTC process,; then<br>
d)	drying the macerated leaf and/or stem; then<br>
e)	optionally sorting the dried macerated leaf and/or stem<br>
20       according to particle size; and<br>
f)	combining the macerated leaf and/or stem with food-<br>
grade additive, preferably particulate food-grade additive.<br>
The process is preferably used to manufacture the beverage 25  precursor of the first aspect of the invention.<br><br>
Detailed Description<br>
The present invention will be further described with reference to the following examples.<br>
5  EXAMPLE 1<br>
Fresh tea leaf {two leaves and a bud) from Camellia sinensis var. assamica was harvested from fields in Kenya. The fresh leaf has a moisture content of 76-80% by weight. The fresh leaf was then air-dried to a leaf moisture content of 75 (±1)%. The leaf was<br>
10  then steamed for 60 seconds at a temperature of  96°C to inactivate any endogenous enzymes and thus prevent fermentation. The moisture content of the steamed leaves was then reduced to 67 (±1) % by passing the leaf through two hot air drum driers in series followed by a vibratory bed hot air drier.<br>
15<br>
Leaf at the end of the vibratory bed was cooled to room temperature (~25°C) and then fed to a rotorvane. Macerated leaf from the rotorvane was then fed through two CTC machines in series. After the CTC processing, the macerated leaf was dried in<br>
2 0  a fluid bed drier to a moisture content of below 3%.<br>
Fibres and the secondaries were then removed from the tea leaf and the leaf sieved. The sorted leaf had a size range of -10+40 mesh (Tyler), a content of catechins of 13.3% by weight and a 25  caffeine content of 2.9% by weight.<br>
The tea leaf was then blended with a flavour composition, dosed into pyramid tea bags and the tea bags sealed. Each tea bag contained 1.9 g of tea leaf and 0.2 g of the flavour composition. 30 The flavour composition was a granular mixture of maltodextrin (carrier) with pineapple and hibiscus aroma. The pineapple aroma comprised 2-propenyl hexanoate.<br><br>
Infusion of a tea bag in 250 ml water at 90°C for 2 mins produced a beverage with a content of catechins of 0.082% by weight and a caffeine content of 0.020% by weight.<br>
5  EXAMPLE 2<br>
Tea bags were made using the same process as that described in Example 1 except that the way in which the tea leaf was macerated was varied. For Test A, maceration consisted of passing the leaf through three CTC machines in series; for Test B, maceration<br>
0 consisted of passing the leaf through two CTC machines in series and for Test C the leaf was macerated as in Example 1, i.e. by passing the fresh leaf through a rotorvane and then two CTC machines in series.<br>
5 Table 1 shows the appearance of the leaf for each of Tests A, B and C. Also shown in Table 1 is the infusion performance in terms of total solids solubilised when a tea bag is infused under identical conditions for each of Tests A, B and C.<br><br>
