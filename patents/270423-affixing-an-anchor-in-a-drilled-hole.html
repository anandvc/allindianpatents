AFFIXING AN ANCHOR IN A DRILLED HOLE<br>
This invention relates to a method of and apparatus for affixing an<br>
anchor in a drilled hole.<br>
It is well known that such drilled holes can be formed in concrete or<br>
other materials but the field with which the present invention is concerned is<br>
primarily concrete anchors.<br>
The use of a setting or curing resin or other plastic material to bond<br>
an anchor into a drilled hole is known from a number of prior art documents. In<br>
particular US patent 6,484,471 of the present inventors issued November 26,<br>
2002 discloses a method in which an anchor is inserted into a drilled hole with the<br>
anchor having a central core within which is a chemical which reacts with oxygen<br>
in an exothermic reaction to generate heat within the anchor to affect an adhesive<br>
material on the exterior of the anchor.<br>
It is known that the anchor itself may be formed of a threaded rod or<br>
may be more complex in shape including a threaded section and a bottom insert<br>
section. In most cases however the bottom insert section will have external<br>
projections for engaging into the adhesive or resin material on the exterior<br>
surface. Thus the arrangement disclosed herein can utilize any of the above<br>
features including those disclosed in the above patent, disclosure of which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
US Patent 6,484,471 describes the method of placing the adhesive<br>
on the anchor, thus eliminating the problems involved with mixing adhesives,<br>
usually consisting of two or more compounds, and after mixing, applying these<br>
adhesives into holes provided for the anchors. The arrangement shown herein,<br>
while useful under certain conditions, is expensive to manufacture and difficult to<br><br>

In the drawings like characters of reference indicate corresponding<br>
parts in the different figures.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
In Figure 1 is shown an anchor body 10 in the form of a rod with<br>
external projections 11 in an upper portion 12 and projections 13 in a lower insert<br>
portion 14 arranged to be inserted into a drilled hole 15 in a body of concrete 16<br>
or the material.<br>
The projections 11 and 13 are formed in the embodiment shown as<br>
a continuous threaded section on the exterior of a rod. However other<br>
projections can be provided in many different arrangements as is well known to<br>
one skilled in the art.<br>
The anchor 10 carries on its exterior surface a band 18 of an<br>
adhesive which has the character that it softens when heated and sets when it<br>
cools, such as a hot melt adhesive. Thus the band 18 is generally cylindrical<br>
where an inner surface 19 in contact with and engagement with the exterior<br>
surface of the rod so that it follows the shape of the surface with the projections<br>
13. The band 18 has an exterior surface 20 which is generally cylindrical so as to<br>
approximately match the cylindrical surface of the drilled hole 15. The adhesive<br>
is thus formed with a thickness which is the difference between the exterior<br>
diameter of the anchor 10 and the interior diameter of the hole 15. This thickness<br>
is sufficient to allow the projections 13 to be received within the hole leaving a<br><br>
WO 2006/056058	PCT/CA2005/001781<br>
7<br>
clearance between the exterior of the projection and the interior of the hole. The<br>
difference in diameter is maintained relatively small so as to avoid providing<br>
shear forces through the structure of the hot melt adhesive when force is applied<br>
to the anchor.<br>
Hot melt adhesive is readily available from many manufacturers and<br>
has the property that it is solid and non-tacky at ambient temperatures but can be<br>
melted at elevated temperatures well above ambient temperatures so that it flows<br>
and thus can enter pores and intestacies to provide an effect bond as the<br>
material cools and resets. Many different such thermoplastic materials are<br>
readily available providing a required strength and temperature of melting as will<br>
be determined by a person skilled in the art.<br>
The anchor as supplied is inserted into the drilled hole 15 and an<br>
induction heating head is applied over the upper section 11 of the anchor which is<br>
exposed above the hole. This arrangement can be used to heat the exterior<br>
portion 11 above the hole so that the heat is conducted through the body of the<br>
anchor to the hot melt adhesive 18 to effect melting of the adhesive and<br>
spreading of the adhesive into the interior between the anchor and the drilled<br>
hole so as to provide bonding of the exterior surface of the adhesive into the<br>
intestacies and pores of the drilled hole to adhesively attach the anchor into the<br>
drilled hole.<br>
After activation of the adhesive 18, the anchor is completed by a<br>
bracket 9 which is held in place by a washer 8 clamped by a nut 7 on the<br>
threaded portion 11.<br>
One example is now described of a device and method which may<br>
be used to produce a product at a considerably lower cost thereby making it<br><br>
WO 2006/056058	PCT/CA2005/001781<br>
8<br>
economically feasible for use by a larger number of individuals and companies.<br>
By retaining the concept of placing the adhesive on the anchor body as shown in<br>
US Patent 6,484,471 but replacing the internal heat source with an external<br>
source a much simpler and economical anchor can be produced.<br>
The outside source of heat is generated by a known technology<br>
generally referred to as induction heating. The process of induction heating relies<br>
on induced currents (eddy currents) within material to produce heat within that<br>
material. The basic components of an induction heating system are an<br>
alternating current (AC) power supply, an induction coil and the article in which<br>
heat is to be generated. The power supply sends an alternating current through<br>
a coil, preferably placed in close proximity to the article to be heated. Under<br>
these circumstances, eddy currents are induced within the article to be heated,<br>
generating controllable amounts of heat without physical contact between the coil<br>
and the article.<br>
Alternating current at frequencies of 5 to 30 kHz are commonly<br>
used and there is a direct relationship between the frequency of the alternating<br>
current and the depth of heat penetration and the time taken to heat an article of<br>
a given size. The induced current flow within an article is most intense on the<br>
surface so the outside of an object will heat more rapidly than the inner portion.<br>
It is desirable to cause the metallic portion of the anchor to reach<br>
such a temperature that the attached heat sensitive adhesive is brought to a<br>
temperature where, in the case of a two part adhesive coating, the activating<br>
agent and the main adhesive component are caused to melt or liquefy, later to<br>
cool and harden.<br>
The method may use a single component adhesive is used, such as<br><br>
WO 2006/056058	PCT/CA2005/001781<br>
9<br>
a 'hot melt' adhesive, where enough heat must be generated to bring the<br>
adhesive to a liquid or molten state. The use of induction heating provides the<br>
rapid heating and precise control of temperatures required to accomplish this.<br>
There are three primary variables involved in attaining the required<br>
amount of heat, the first being the size of the anchor installed. There is, for the<br>
most part, a direct relationship between the length and diameter of the various<br>
anchors to be used with this system.<br>
Two other variables, ambient temperature and humidity within the<br>
immediate area of the anchor to be activated are important in order to determine<br>
the precise amount of time the unit needs to operate to provide the required<br>
temperature. Using known technology, two sensors are provided to make<br>
measurable signals available to the microprocessor.<br>
The control system of the heating device is arranged to control the<br>
heating cycle in dependence upon these measured characteristics to ensure an<br>
accurate application of heat to the exposed portion of the anchor and thus to the<br>
adhesive.<br>
The heating device 19 includes a manually portable housing 20<br>
which can be lifted by the operator by a handle 20A and moved form anchor to<br>
anchor located in a concrete substrate layer. The housing includes a circuit<br>
having a manually operable switch 21 for actuation of heat to a coil 22.<br>
The coil is located at a receptacle 23 in the form of a pair of<br>
surfaces which define a V-shape by sides 24. This acts to locate the anchor<br>
when in the V-shaped receptacle so that it is properly placed within the heating<br>
coil above the receptacle 23.<br>
At the receptacle is located a detecting or measuring arm 25 so that<br><br>
WO 2006/056058	PCT/CA2005/001781<br>
10<br>
as the anchor enters the receptacle it engages the arm 25 and depresses the<br>
arm. The arm is mounted on a sensor 26 so that it can move in dependence<br>
upon its engagement with the anchor surface of the exposed portion of the<br>
anchor above the hole. The receptacle carries a micro-switch 27 which provides<br>
an indication of when the anchor is properly located in the receptacle.<br>
The circuit receives power from a source 28 controlled by a power<br>
supply module 29. The power to the coil is controlled in a heating cycle of<br>
required length for the conditions by a microprocessor controller 30. Input to the<br>
microprocessor 30 is provided from the measuring arm sensor 26 and the gate<br>
micro-switch 27 responsive to the presence of the anchor in the receptacle and<br>
by environment sensors including temperature sensor 31 and humidity sensor 32.<br>
The sizing plate or receptacle 23, mentioned in the technical<br>
description, with its V-shaped opening (sizing notch) defined by sides 24 and the<br>
position sensor (size (diameter) sensor) 33 provides a measurable signal, related<br>
to the diameter of the exposed portion of the anchor, to the microprocessor 30 in<br>
the following manner. With the anchor positioned in its hole in the substrate and<br>
before the adhesive is activated, the unit carrying the sizing plate is positioned<br>
before the anchor and moved toward the anchor, the exposed portion of the<br>
anchor enters the V-shaped notch in the sizing plate. At some point, dependant<br>
on the diameter of the anchor, the sizing plate can not be moved further in a<br>
forward direction because the anchor has come to rest against both angle edges<br>
of the V-shaped notch. During this operation, the sizing sensor arm 25 is forced<br>
rearward by contact with the exposed portion of the anchor and a measurable<br>
signal is made available to the microprocessor indicating the diameter of the<br>
exposed portion of the anchor.<br><br>
WO 2006/056058	PCT/CA2005/001781<br>
11<br>
The sizing sensor 26 may be of known technology such as a<br>
resistance measuring device which is calibrated in relation to the length and<br>
angle of the sizing slot edges so as to provide and accurate and repeatable<br>
signal directly related to anchor diameter.<br>
When the operating switch 21 is activated information from these<br>
three sensors 31, 32 and 33 is correlated within the programmable<br>
microprocessor controller 30 to provide a time related signal to the power supply<br>
29 which then operates for the required time period to supply induction heating<br>
energy to the coil 22.<br>
Due to the critical nature of the temperature levels required, it is<br>
desirable to remove as much control as possible from the operator of the device.<br>
This is accomplished by providing the activating switch 21 of the momentary<br>
contact type which only begins the process, after which control is maintained by<br>
the microprocessor. Two warning lights 35 and 36 are provided on the heating<br>
unit. The first 35, green in color, is controlled by the microprocessor 30, and is<br>
illuminated when the unit is turned on or connected to line power, indicating to the<br>
operator that the unit is ready to use. A second warning light 36, red in color,<br>
also controlled by the microprocessor, illuminates when the momentary contact<br>
operating switch is.pressed and remains illuminated until the heating cycle is<br>
complete, after which it is turned off and the green warning light is illuminated<br>
informing the operator that the unit is ready to be applied to another anchor.<br>
In order to prevent an anchor from being heated twice, an arm or<br>
gate 37 is positioned on the sizing plate or receptacle 23 in such a position that it<br>
extends across the opening leading to the V-shaped opening in the sizing plate<br>
23.   The pivoted end of this gate 37 is spring loaded in order to return to its<br><br>
WO 2006/056058	PCT/CA2005/001781<br>
12<br>
normal, at rest, position across the V-shaped opening. The opposite end of the<br>
spring loaded arm rests against the normally closed microswitch 27, which is also<br>
mounted on the sizing plate, holding the switch 27 in its open position. When the<br>
unit is positioned before the anchor and moved in a forward direction, the<br>
movement of the exposed portion of the anchor into the V-shaped slot in the<br>
sizing plate 23 causes the gate 37 to move away from the microswitch 27,<br>
allowing it to close. This information, in the form of a measurable signal informs<br>
the microprocessor that the unit is positioned over an anchor to be activated<br>
allowing the unit to operate through one cycle, however, if the operating switch 21<br>
is activated more than once without moving the unit away from the anchor to<br>
allow the gate to open the microswitch 27, the microprocessor is programmed to<br>
block further operation.<br>
When an inactivated anchor is to be processed the unit is<br>
positioned before the anchor and then moved forward till the anchor enters the<br>
angled sizing notch in the receptacle or sizing plate. The unit is then moved<br>
forward until the anchor will not enter the notch further. At this time, the pivoted<br>
gate 37, which normally rests across the opening to the receptacle 23, is also<br>
displaced rearwardly by the movement of the exposed portion of the anchor. This<br>
causes the switch 27 to move to its normally closed condition. Closing the switch<br>
27 signals the<br>
microprocessor to allow sensor readings from the ambient temperature sensor<br>
31, the humidity sensor 32 and the size sensor 33 to be correlated by the<br>
microprocessor to calculate optimum time for operation of the heating coil. At this<br>
time, the green warning light is illuminated to inform the operator that the unit is<br>
ready to be activated.<br><br>
WO 2006/056058	PCT/CA2005/001781<br>
13<br>
When the operator presses the momentary contact operating switch<br>
21 a signal is sent to the microprocessor 30. On receipt of this signal, the<br>
microprocessor 30 turns off the green warning light and turns on the red warning<br>
light informing the operator that the heating process is under way. At the same<br>
time, the microprocessor sends a control signal to the power supply 29 which, in<br>
turn, supplies an alternating current of the preferred frequency to the heating coil<br>
for the precise amount of time required to heat the anchor and activate the<br>
adhesive. At the end of the heating cycle, the microprocessor 30 turns off the red<br>
warning light. The action of the green warning light is dependant upon the unit<br>
being removed from the activated anchor allowing the sizing plate gate switch to<br>
open.<br>
Since various modifications can be made in my invention as herein<br>
above described, and many apparently widely different embodiments of same<br>
made within the spirit and scope of the claims without departing from such spirit<br>
and scope, it is intended that all matter contained in the accompanying<br>
specification shall be interpreted as illustrative only and not in a limiting sense.<br><br>
