Description<br>
DIGITAL BROADCASTING SYSTEM AND DATA<br>
PROCESSING METHOD<br>
Technical Field<br>
[1]	The present invention relates to a digital broadcasting system, and more particularly,<br>
to a digital broadcasting system and a data processing method.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2]	The Vestigial Sideband (VSB) transmission mode, which is adopted as the standard<br>
for digital broadcasting in North America and the Republic of Korea, is a system using<br>
a single carrier method. Therefore, the receiving performance of the digital broadcast<br>
receiving system may be deteriorated in a poor channel environment.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Problem<br>
[3]	Particularly, since resistance to changes in channels and noise is more highly<br>
required when using portable and/or mobile broadcast receivers, the receiving per-<br>
formance may be even more deteriorated when transmitting mobile service data by the<br>
VSB transmission mode.<br>
Technical Solution<br>
[4]	Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a digital broadcasting system and a<br>
data processing method that substantially obviate one or more problems due to lim-<br>
itations and disadvantages of the related art.<br>
[5]	An object of the present invention is to provide a digital broadcasting system and a<br>
data processing method that are highly resistant to channel changes and noise.<br>
[6]	Another object of the present invention is to provide a digital broadcasting system<br>
and method of processing data therein, by which a notification message can be<br>
transmitted/received via a notification channel.<br>
[7]	Another object of the present invention is to provide a receiving system and method<br>
of processing data therein, by which an emergency can be notified to a user in the<br>
course of a mobile service in a manner of receiving and processing EAS (emergency<br>
alert system) data according to an emergency via a notification channel.<br>
[8]	A further object of the present invention is to provide a receiving system and method<br>
of processing data therein, by which guide information of the receiving system can be<br>
efficiently updated in a manner of receiving and processing ESG update information<br>
according to a broadcast schedule change via a notification channel.<br>
[9]	Additional advantages, objects, and features of the invention will be set forth in part<br>
in the description which follows and in part will become apparent to those having<br>
 <br>
ordinary skill in the art upon examination of the following or may be learned from<br>
practice of the invention. The objectives and other advantages of the invention may be<br>
realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the written description<br>
and claims hereof as well as the appended drawings,<br>
[ 10]	To achieve these objects and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of<br>
the invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, a receiving system according<br>
to the present invention includes a baseband processor unit, a management processor,<br>
and a presentation processor unit. The baseband processor unit receives a broadcast<br>
signal including mobile service data and main service data. The mobile service data<br>
can configure an RS frame and wherein the RS frame includes at least one of the<br>
mobile service data and a notification message and at least one of a first signaling in-<br>
formation describing signaling information of a virtual channel for transmitting the<br>
mobile service data and a second signaling information describing signaling in-<br>
formation on a notification channel for transmitting the notification message. The<br>
management processor unit accesses the notification message by parsing the second<br>
signaling information from the RS frame. The management processor unit processes<br>
the accessed notification message and stores the processed notification message in a<br>
storage device. The presentation processor unit outputs the processes notification<br>
message to an output device.<br>
[11]	Data of the RS frame can configure at least one or more data groups, each of the at<br>
least one or more data groups includes the data of the RS frame and a plurality of<br>
known data sequences, and transmission parameter channel (TPC) data and fast in-<br>
formation channel (FIC) data are received by being included between a first known<br>
data sequence and a second known data sequence among a plurality of the known data<br>
sequences.<br>
[ 12]	The TPC data includes information for identifying an update of the FIC data and the<br>
FIC data includes notification channel information on the notification channel for<br>
transmitting the notification message and ensemble identifying information on an<br>
ensemble including the notification channel.<br>
[13]	The FIC data further includes information for identifying whether the notification<br>
message received on the corresponding notification channel has an emergency<br>
property.<br>
[14]	The notification channel is activated if a notification event occurs. The notification<br>
channel is deactivated if the notification event ends. And, the FIC data includes in-<br>
formation for identifying whether the notification channel is activated.<br>
[15]	The second signaling information is received by being included in the RS frame of an<br>
ensemble having the notification channel exist therein and the second signaling in-<br>
formation includes access information of the notification channel and the notification<br>
 <br>
message received on the notification channel.<br>
[ 16]	The notification message includes information for identifying the corresponding noti-<br>
fication message, version information of the corresponding notification message, valid<br>
period information of the corresponding notification message and notification contents.<br>
[17]	The notification message further includes identification information for identifying<br>
whether the corresponding notification message has an emergency attribute.<br>
[18]	If the corresponding notification message is fragmented, the notification message<br>
further includes information for identifying an order of a corresponding fragment or an<br>
order of a last fragment.<br>
[ 19]	If the accessed notification message includes EAS data, the management processor<br>
unit processes the EAS data according to priority information of the EAS data and then<br>
outputs the processed EAS data to the presentation processor unit.<br>
[20]	If the accessed notification message includes schedule update information, the<br>
management processor unit processes the schedule update information and then<br>
updates schedule relevant guide information stored in the storage device.<br>
[21]	In another aspect of the present invention, a method of processing data in a receiving<br>
system includes the steps of receiving a broadcast signal including mobile service data<br>
and main service data, wherein the mobile service data can configure an RS frame and<br>
wherein the RS frame includes at least one of the mobile service data and a notification<br>
message and at least one of a first signaling information describing signaling in-<br>
formation of a virtual channel for transmitting the mobile service data and a second<br>
signaling information describing signaling information on a notification channel for<br>
transmitting the notification message, accessing the notification message by parsing<br>
the second signaling information from the RS frame and processing the accessed noti-<br>
fication message, storing the processed notification message in a storage device, and<br>
outputting the processes notification message to an output device.<br>
[22]	It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following<br>
detailed description of the present invention are exemplary and explanatory and are<br>
intended to provide further explanation of the invention as claimed.<br>
Advantageous Effects<br>
[23]	According to the present invention, a notification message is received using a noti-<br>
fication dedicated channel and is then processed. In doing so, ESG update information<br>
or EAS data according to an emergency can be delivered on the notification channel.<br>
Therefore, if an emergency takes place in the course o a mobile service, an emergency<br>
alert service can be quickly provided to a user. Moreover, if a broadcast schedule is<br>
changed, ESG update is quickly performed. Therefore, a user can be quickly provided<br>
with a correct broadcast schedule despite an unexpected change of a broadcast<br>
 <br>
schedule.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[70]	Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever<br>
possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to<br>
the same or like parts. In addition, although the terms used in the present invention are<br>
selected from generally known and used terms, some of the terms mentioned in the de-<br>
scription of the present invention have been selected by the applicant at his or her<br>
discretion, the detailed meanings of which are described in relevant parts of the de-<br>
scription herein. Furthermore, it is required that the present invention is understood,<br>
not simply by the actual terms used but by the meaning of each term lying within.<br>
[71]	Among the terms used in the description of the present invention, main service data<br>
correspond to data that can be received by a fixed receiving system and may include<br>
audio/video (A/V) data. More specifically, the main service data may include A/V data<br>
of high definition (HD) or standard definition (SD) levels and may also include diverse<br>
 <br>
data types required for data broadcasting. Also, the known data correspond to data pre-<br>
known in accordance with a pre-arranged agreement between the receiving system and<br>
the transmitting system. Additionally, among the terms used in the present invention,<br>
"MH" corresponds to the initials of "mobile" and "handheld" and represents the<br>
opposite concept of a fixed-type system. Furthermore, the MH service data may<br>
include at least one of mobile service data and handheld service data, and will also be<br>
referred to as "mobile service data" for simplicity. Herein, the mobile service data not<br>
only correspond to MH service data but may also include any type of service data with<br>
mobile or portable characteristics. Therefore, the mobile sendee data according to the<br>
present invention are not limited only to the MH service data.<br>
[72]	The above-described mobile service data may correspond to data having information,<br>
such as program execution files, stock information, and so on, and may also<br>
correspond to A/V data. Most particularly, the mobile service data may correspond to<br>
A/V data having lower resolution and lower data rate as compared to the main service<br>
data. For example, if an A/V codec that is used for a conventional main service cor-<br>
responds to a MPEG-2 codec, a MPEG-4 advanced video coding (AVC) or scalable<br>
video coding (SVC) having better image compression efficiency may be used as the A/<br>
V codec for the mobile service. Furthermore, any type of data may be transmitted as<br>
the mobile service data. For example, transport protocol expert group (TPEG) data for<br>
broadcasting real-time transportation information may be transmitted as the main<br>
service data.<br>
[73]	Also, a data service using the mobile service data may include weather forecast<br>
services, traffic information services, stock information services, viewer participation<br>
quiz programs, real-time polls and surveys, interactive education broadcast programs,<br>
gaming services, services providing information on synopsis, character, background<br>
music, and filming sites of soap operas or series, services providing information on<br>
past match scores and player profiles and achievements, and services providing in-<br>
formation on product information and programs classified by service, medium, time,<br>
and theme enabling purchase orders to be processed. Herein, the present invention is<br>
not limited only to the services mentioned above. In the present invention, the<br>
transmitting system provides backward compatibility in the main service data so as to<br>
be received by the conventional receiving system. Herein, the main service data and<br>
the mobile service data are multiplexed to the same physical channel and then<br>
transmitted.<br>
[74]	Furthermore, the digital broadcast transmitting system according to the present<br>
invention performs additional encoding on the mobile service data and inserts the data<br>
already known by the receiving system and transmitting system (e.g., known data),<br>
thereby transmitting the processed data. Therefore, when using the transmitting system<br>
 <br>
according to the present invention, the receiving system may receive the mobile<br>
service data during a mobile state and may also receive the mobile service data with<br>
stability despite various distortion and noise occurring within the channel.<br>
[75]<br>
[76]	Receiving System<br>
[77]	FIG. 1 illustrates a block diagram showing a general structure of a digital<br>
broadcasting receiving system according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The digital broadcast receiving system according to the present invention includes a<br>
baseband processor 100, a management processor 200, and a presentation processor<br>
300. The baseband processor 100 includes an operation controller 110, a tuner 120, a<br>
demodulator 130, an equalizer 140, a known sequence detector (or known data<br>
detector) 150, a block decoder (or mobile handheld block decoder) 160, a promary<br>
Reed-Solomon (RS) frame decoder 170, a secondary RS frame decoder 180, and a<br>
signaling decoder 190. The operation controller 110 controls the operation of each<br>
block included in the baseband processor 100.<br>
[78]	By tuning the receiving system to a specific physical channel frequency, the tuner<br>
120 enables the receiving system to receive main service data, which correspond to<br>
broadcast signals for fixed-type broadcast receiving systems, and mobile service data,<br>
which correspond to broadcast signals for mobile broadcast receiving systems. At this<br>
point, the tuned frequency of the specific physical channel is down-converted to an in-<br>
termediate frequency (IF) signal, thereby being outputted to the demodulator 130 and<br>
the known sequence detector 140. The passband digital IF signal being outputted from<br>
the tuner 120 may only include main service data, or only include mobile service data,<br>
or include both main service data and mobile service data.<br>
[79]	The demodulator 130 performs self-gain control, carrier recovery, and timing<br>
recovery processes on the passband digital IF signal inputted from the tuner 120,<br>
thereby modifying the IF signal to a baseband signal. Then, the demodulator 130<br>
outputs the baseband signal to the equalizer 140 and the known sequence detector 150.<br>
The demodulator 130 uses the known data symbol sequence inputted from the known<br>
sequence detector 150 during the timing and/or carrier recovery, thereby enhancing the<br>
demodulating performance. The equalizer 140 compensates channel-associated<br>
distortion included in the signal demodulated by the demodulator 130. Then, the<br>
equalizer 140 outputs the distortion-compensated signal to the blcok decoder 160. By<br>
using a known data symbol sequence inputted from the lnown sequence detector 150,<br>
the equalizer 140 may enhance the equalizing performance. Furthermore, the equalizer<br>
140 may receive feed-back on the decoding result from the block decoder 160, thereby<br>
enhancing the equalizing performance.<br>
[80]	The known sequence detector 150 detects known data place (or position) inserted by<br>
 <br>
the transmitting system from the input/output data (i.e., data prior to being de-<br>
modulated or data being processed with partial demodulation). Then, the known<br>
sequence detector 150 outputs the detected known data position information and<br>
known data sequence generated from the detected position information to the de-<br>
modulator 130 and the equalizer 140. Additionally, in order to allow the block decoder<br>
160 to identify the mobile service data that have been processed with additional<br>
encoding by the transmitting system and the main service data that have not been<br>
processed with any additional encoding, the known sequence detector 150 outputs such<br>
corresponding information to the block decoder 160.<br>
[81]	If the data channel-equalized by the equalizer 140 and inputted to the block decoder<br>
160 correspond to data processed with both block-encoding and trellis-encoding by the<br>
transmitting system (i.e., data within the RS frame, signaling data), the block decoder<br>
160 may perform trellis-decoding and block-decoding as inverse processes of the<br>
transmitting system. On the other hand, if the data channel-equalized by the equalizer<br>
140 and inputted to the block decoder 160 correspond to data processed only with<br>
trellis-encoding and not block-encoding by the transmitting system (i.e., main service<br>
data), the block decoder 160 may perform only trellis-decoding.<br>
[82]	The signaling decoder 190 decoded signaling data that have been channel-equalized<br>
and inputted from the equalizer 140. It is assumed that the signaling data inputted to<br>
the signaling decoder 190 correspond to data processed with both block-encoding and<br>
trellis-encoding by the transmitting system. Examples of such signaling data may<br>
include transmission parameter channel (TPC) data and fast information channel (FIC)<br>
data. Each type of data will be described in more detail in a later process. The FIC data<br>
decoded by the signaling decoder 190 are outputted to the FIC handler 215. And, the<br>
TPC data decoded by the signlaing decoder 190 are outputted to the TPC handler 214.<br>
[83]	Meanwhile, according to the present invention, me transmitting system uses RS<br>
frames by encoding units. Herein, the RS frame may be divided into a primary RS<br>
frame and a secondary RS frame. However, according to the embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the primary RS frame and the secodnary RS frame will be divided<br>
based upon the level of importance of the corresponding data. The primary RS frame<br>
decoder 170 receives the data outputted from the block decoder 160. At this point,<br>
according to the embodiment of the present invention, the primary RS frame decoder<br>
170 receives only the mobile service data that have been Reed-Solomon (RS)-encoded<br>
and/or cyclic reduncancy check (CRC)-encoded from the block decoder 160.<br>
[84]	Herein, the primary RS frame decoder 170 receives only the mobile service data and<br>
not the main service data. The primary RS frame decoder 170 performs inverse<br>
processes of an RS frame encoder (not shown) included in the digital broadcast<br>
transmitting system, thereby correcting errors existing within the primary RS frame.<br>
 <br>
More specifically, the primary RS frame decoder 170 forms a primary RS frame by<br>
grouping a plurality of data groups and, then, correct errors in primary RS frame units.<br>
In other words, the primary RS frame decoder 170 decodes primary RS frames, which<br>
are being transmitted for actual broadcast services.<br>
[85]	Additionally, the secondary RS frame decoder 180 receives the data outputted from<br>
the block decoder 160. At this point, according to the embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the secondary RS frame decoder 180 receives only the mobile service data<br>
that have been RS-encoded and/or CRC-encoded from the block decoder 160. Herein,<br>
the secondary RS frame decoder 180 receives only the mobile service data and not the<br>
main service data. The secondary RS frame decoder 180 performs inverse processes of<br>
an RS frame encoder (not shown) included in the digital broadcast transmitting system,<br>
thereby correcting errors existing within the secondary RS frame. More specifically,<br>
the secondary RS frame decoder 180 forms a secondary RS frame by grouping a<br>
plurality of data groups and, then, correct errors in secondary RS frame units. In other<br>
words, the secondary RS frame decoder 180 decodes secondary RS frames, which are<br>
being transmitted for mobile audio service data, mobile video service data, guide data,<br>
and so on.<br>
[86]	Meanwhile, the management processor 200 according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention includes an MH physical adaptation processor 210, an IP network<br>
stack 220, a streaming handler 230, a system information (SI) handler 240, a file<br>
handler 250, a multi-purpose internet main extensions (MIME) type handler 260, and<br>
an electronic service guide (ESG) handler 270, and an ESG decoder 280, and a storage<br>
unit 290. The MH physical adaptation processor 210 includes a primary RS frame<br>
handler 211, a secondary RS frame handler 212, an MH transport packet (TP) handler<br>
213, a TPC handler 214, an FTC handler 215, and a physical adpatation control signal<br>
handler 216. The TPC handler 214 receives and processes baseband information<br>
required by modules corresponding to the MH physical adaptation processor 210. The<br>
baseband information is inputted in the form of TPC data. Herein, the TPC handler 214<br>
uses this information to process the FIC data, which have been sent from the baseband<br>
processor 100.<br>
[87]	The TPC data are transmitted from the transmitting system to the receiving system<br>
via a predetermined region of a data group. The TPC data may include at least one of<br>
an MH ensemble ID, an MH sub-frame number, a total number of MH groups (TNoG),<br>
an RS frame continuity counter, a column size of RS frame (N), and an FIC version<br>
number. Herein, the MH ensemble ID indicates an identification number of each MH<br>
ensemble carried in the corresponding channel. The MH sub-frame number signifies a<br>
number identifying the MH sub-frame number in an MH frame, wherein each MH<br>
group associated with the corresponding MH ensemble is transmitted. The TNoG<br>
 <br>
represents the total number of MH groups including all of the MH groups belonging to<br>
all MH parades included in an MH sub-frame. The RS frame continuity counter<br>
indicates a number that serves as a continuity counter of the RS frames carrying the<br>
corresponding MH ensemble. Herein, the value of the RS frame continuity counter<br>
shall be incremented by 1 modulo 16 for each successive RS frame. N represents the<br>
column size of an RS frame belonging to the corresponding MH ensemble. Herein, the<br>
value of N determines the size of each MH TP. Finally, the FIC version number<br>
signifies the version number of an FIC body carried on the corresponding physical<br>
channel.<br>
[88 ]	As described above, diverse TPC data are inputted to the TPC handler 214 via the<br>
signaling decoedr 190 shown in FIG. 1. Then, the received TPC data are. processed by<br>
the TPC handler 214. The received TPC data may also be used by the FIC handler 215<br>
in order to process the FIC data. The FIC handler 215 processes the FTC data by as-<br>
sociating the FIC data received from the baseband processor 100 with the TPC data.<br>
The physical adaptation control signal handler 216 collects FIC data received through<br>
the FIC handler 215 and SI data received through RS frames. Then, the physical<br>
adaptation control signal handler 216 uses the collected FIC data and SI data to<br>
configure and process IP datagrams and access information of mobile broadcast<br>
services. Thereafter, the physical adaptation control signal handler 216 stores the<br>
processed IP datagrams and access information to the storage unit 290.<br>
[89]	The primary RS frame handler 211 identifies primary RS frames received from the<br>
primary RS frame decoder 170 of the baseband processor 100 for each row unit, so as<br>
to configure an MH TP. Thereafter, the primary RS frame handler 211 outputs the<br>
configured MH TP to the MH TP handler 213. The secondary RS frame handler 212<br>
identifies secondary RS frames received from the secondary RS frame decoder 180 of<br>
the baseband processor 100 for each row unit, so as to configure an MH TP.<br>
Thereafter, the secondary RS frame handler 212 outputs the configured MH TP to the<br>
MH TP handler 213. The MH transport packet (TP) handler 213 extracts a header from<br>
each MH TP received from the primary RS frame handler 211 and the secondary RS<br>
frame handler 212, thereby determining the data included in the corresponding MH TP.<br>
Then, when the determined data correspond to SI data (i.e., SI data that are not en-<br>
capsulated to IP datagrams), the corresponding data are outputted to the physical<br>
adaptation control signal handler 216. Alterantively, when the determined data<br>
correspond to an IP datagram, the corresponding data are outputted to the IP network<br>
stack 220.<br>
[90]	The IP network stack 220 processes broadcast data that are being transmitted in the<br>
form of IP datagrams. More specifically, the IP network stack 220 processes data that<br>
are inputted via user datagram protocol (UDP), real-time transport protocol (RTP),<br>
 <br>
real-time transport control protocol (RTCP), asynchronous layered coding/layered<br>
coding transport (ALC/LCT), file delivery over unidirectional transport (FLUTE), and<br>
so on. Herein, when the processed data correspond to streaming data, the corre-<br>
sponding data are outputted to the streaming handler 230. And, when the processed<br>
data correspond to data in a file format, the corresponding data are outputted to the file<br>
handler 250. Finally, when the processed data correspond to Si-associated data, the<br>
corresponding data are outputted to the ST handler 240.<br>
[91]	The SI handler 240 receives and processes SI data having the form of IP datagrams,<br>
which are inputted to the IP network stack 220. When the inputted data associated with<br>
SI correspond to MIME-type data, the inputted data are outputted to the MIME-type<br>
handler 260. The MIME-type handler 260 receives the MIME-type SI data outputted<br>
from the SI handler 240 and processes the received MIME-type SI data. The file<br>
handler 250 receives data from the IP network stack 220 in an object format in ac-<br>
cordance with the ALC/LCT and FLUTE structures. The file handler 250 groups the<br>
received data to create a file format. Herein, when the corresponding file includes<br>
ESG, the file is outputted to the ESG handler 270. On the other hand, when the corre-<br>
sponding file includes data for other file-based services, the file is outputted to the pre-<br>
sentation controller 330 of the presentation processor 300.<br>
[92]	The ESG handler 270 processes the ESG data received from the file handler 250 and<br>
stores the processed ESG data to the storage unit 290. Alternatively, the ESG handler<br>
270 may output the processed ESG data to the ESG decoder 280, thereby allowing the<br>
ESG data to be used by the ESG decoder 280. The storage unit 290 stores the system<br>
information (SI) received from the physical adaptation control signal handler 210 and<br>
the ESG handler 270 therein. Thereafter, the storage unit 290 transmits the stored SI<br>
data to each block.<br>
[93]	The ESG decoder 280 either recovers the ESG data and SI data stored in the storage<br>
unit 290 or recovers the ESG data transmitted from the ESG handler 270. Then, the<br>
ESG decoder 280 outputs the recovered data to the presentation controller 330 in a<br>
format that can be outputted to the user. The streaming handler 230 receives data from<br>
the IP network stack 220, wherein the format of the received data are in accordance<br>
with RTP and/or RTCP structures. The streaming handler 230extracts audio/video<br>
streams from the received data, which are then outputted to the audio/video (A/V)<br>
decoder 310 of the presentation processor 300. The audio/video decoder 310 then<br>
decodes each of the audio stream and video stream received from the streaming<br>
handler 230.<br>
[94]	The display module 320 of the presentation processor 300 receives audio and video<br>
signals respectively decoded by the A/V decoder 310. Then, the display module 320<br>
provides the received audio and video signals to the user through a speaker and/or a<br>
 <br>
screen. The presentation controller 330 corresponds to a controller managing modules<br>
that output data received by the receiving system to the user. The channel service<br>
manager 340 manages an interface with the user, which enables the user to use<br>
channel-based broadcast services, such as channel map management, channel service<br>
connection, and so on. The application manager 350 manages an interface with a user<br>
using ESG display or other application services that do not correspond to channel-<br>
based services.<br>
[95]<br>
[96 ]	Data Format Structure<br>
[97]	Meanwhile, the data structure used in the mobile broadcasting technology according<br>
to the embodiment of the present invention may include a data group structure and an<br>
RS frame structure, which will now be described in detail. FIG. 2 illustrates an<br>
exemplary structure of a data group according to the present invention. FIG. 2 shows<br>
an example of dividing a data group according to the data structure of the present<br>
invention into 10 MH blocks (i.e., MH block 1 (B1) to MH block 10 (B10)). In this<br>
example, each MH block has the length of 16 segments. Referring to FIG. 2, only the<br>
RS parity data are allocated to portions of the first 5 segments of the MH block 1 (B1)<br>
and the last 5 segments of the MH block 10 (B10). The RS parity data are excluded in<br>
regions A to D of the data group. More specifically, when it is assumed that one data<br>
group is divided into regions A, B, C, and D, each MH block may be included in any<br>
one of region A to region D depending upon the characteristic of each MH block<br>
within the data group.<br>
[98]	Herein, the data group is divided into a plurality of regions to be used for different<br>
purposes. More specifically, a region of the main service data having no interference or<br>
a very low interference level may be considered to have a more resistant (or stronger)<br>
receiving performance as compared to regions having higher interference levels. Addi-<br>
tionally, when using a system inserting and transmitting known data in the data group,<br>
wherein the known data are known based upon an agreement between the transmitting<br>
system and the receiving system, and when consecutively long known data are to be<br>
periodically inserted in the mobile service data, the known data having a prede-<br>
termined length may be periodically inserted in the region having no interference from<br>
the main service data (i.e., a region wherein the main service data are not mixed).<br>
However, due to interference from the main service data, it is difficult to periodically<br>
insert known data and also to insert consecutively long known data to a region having<br>
interference from the main service data.<br>
[99]	Referring to FIG. 2, MH block 4 (B4) to MH block 7 (B7) correspond to regions<br>
without interference of the main service data. MH block 4 (B4) to MH block 7 (B7)<br>
within the data group shown in FIG. 2 correspond to a region where no interference<br>
 <br>
from the main service data occurs. In this example, a long known data sequence is<br>
inserted at both the beginning and end of each MH block. Tn the description of the<br>
present invention, the region including MH block 4 (B4) to MH block 7 (B7) will be<br>
referred to as "region A (=B4+B5+B6+B7)". As described above, when the data group<br>
includes region A having a long known data sequence inserted at both the beginning<br>
and end of each MH block, the receiving system is capable of performing equalization<br>
by using the channel information that can be obtained from the known data. Therefore,<br>
the strongest equalizing performance may be yielded (or obtained) from one of region<br>
A to region D.<br>
[ 1001	In the example of the data group shown in FIG. 2, MH block 3 (B3) and MH block<br>
8 (B8) correspond to a region having little interference from the main service data.<br>
Herein, a long known data sequence is inserted in only one side of each MH block B3<br>
and B8. More specifically, due to the interference from the main service data, a long<br>
known data sequence is inserted at the end of MH block 3 (B3), and another long<br>
known data sequence is inserted at the beginning of MH block 8 (B8). In the present<br>
invention, the region including MH block 3 (B3) and MH block 8 (B8) will be referred<br>
to as "region B (=B3+B8)". As described above, when the data group includes region<br>
B having a long known data sequence inserted at only one side (beginning or end) of<br>
each MH block, the receiving system is capable of performing equalization by using<br>
the channel information that can be obtained from the known data. Therefore, a<br>
stronger equalizing performance as compared to region C/D may be yielded (or<br>
obtained).<br>
[101]	Referring to FIG. 2, MH block 2 (B2) and MH block 9 (B9) correspond to a region<br>
having more interference from the main service data as compared to region B. A long<br>
known data sequence cannot be inserted in any side of MH block 2 (B2) and MH block<br>
9 (B9). Herein, the region including MH block 2 (B2) and MH block 9 (B9) will be<br>
referred to as "region C (=B2+B9)". Finally, in the example shown in FIG. 2, MH<br>
block 1 (B1) and MH block 10 (B10) correspond to a region having more interference<br>
from the main service data as compared to region C. Similarly, a long known data<br>
sequence cannot be inserted in any side of MH block 1 (B1) and MH block 10 (B10).<br>
Herein, the region including MH block 1 (Bl) and MH block 10 (B10) will be referred<br>
to as "region D (=B1+B10)". Since region C/D is spaced further apart from the known<br>
data sequence, when the channel environment undergoes frequent and abrupt changes,<br>
the receiving performance of region C/D may be deteriorated.<br>
[102]	Additionally, the data group includes a signaling information area wherein<br>
signaling information is assigned (or allocated). In the present invention, the signaling<br>
information area may start from the 1st segment of the 4th MH block (B4) to a portion<br>
of the 2nd segment. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
 <br>
signaling information area for inserting signaling information may start from the 1st<br>
segment of the 4th MH block (B4) to a portion of the 2nd segment. More specifically,<br>
276(=207+69) bytes of the 4th MH block (B4) in each data group are assigned as the<br>
signaling information area. In other words, the signaling information area consists of<br>
207 bytes of the 1st segment and the first 69 bytes of the 2nd segment of the 4th MH<br>
block (B4). The 1st segment of the 4th MH block (B4) corresponds to the 17th or<br>
173rd segment of a VSB field.<br>
[103]	Herein, the signaling information may be identified by two different types of<br>
signaling channels: a transmission parameter channel (TPC) and a fast information<br>
channel (FIC). Herein, the TPC data may include at least one of an MH ensemble ID,<br>
an MH sub-frame number, a total number of MH groups (TNoG), an RS frame<br>
continuity counter, a column size of RS frame (N), and an FIC version number.<br>
However, the TPC data (or information) presented herein are merely exemplary. And,<br>
since the adding or deleting of signaling information included in the TPC data may be<br>
easily adjusted and modified by one skilled in the art, the present invention will,<br>
therefore, not be limited to the examples set forth herein. Furthermore, the FIC is<br>
provided to enable a fast service acquisition of data receivers, and the FIC includes<br>
cross layer information between the physical layer and the upper layer(s).<br>
[ 104]	For example, when the data group includes 6 known data sequences, as shown in<br>
FIG. 2, the signaling information area is located between the first known data sequence<br>
and the second known data sequence. More specifically, the first known data sequence<br>
is inserted in the last 2 segments of the 3rd MH block (B3), and the second known data<br>
sequence in inserted in the 2nd and 3rd segments of the 4th MH block (B4). Fur-<br>
thermore, the 3rd to 6th known data sequences are respectively inserted in the last 2<br>
segments of each of the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th MH blocks (B4, B5, B6, and B7). The 1st<br>
and 3rd to 6th known data sequences are spaced apart by 16 segments.<br>
[105]	FIG. 3 illustrates an RS frame according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention. The RS frame shown in FIG. 3 corresponds to a collection of one or more<br>
data groups. The RS frame is received for each MH frame in a condition where the<br>
receiving system receives the FIC and processes the received FIC and where the<br>
receiving system is switched to a time-slicing mode so that the receiving system can<br>
receive MH ensembles including ESG entry points. Each RS frame includes IP streams<br>
of each service or ESG, and SMT section data may exist in all RS frames. The RS<br>
frame according to the embodiment of the present invention consists of at least one<br>
MH transport packet (TP). Herein, the MH TP includes an MH header and an MH<br>
payload.<br>
[106]	The MH payload may include mobile service data as wekk as signaling data. More<br>
specifically, an MH payload may include only mobile service data, or may include<br>
 <br>
only signaling data, or may include both mobile service data and signaling data.<br>
According to the embodiment of the present invention, the MH header may identify (or<br>
distinguish) the data, types included in the MH payload. More specifically, when the<br>
MH TP includes a first MH header, this indicates that the MH payload includes only<br>
the signaling data. Also, when the MH TP includes a second MH header, this indicates<br>
that the MH payload includes both the signaling data and the mobile service data.<br>
Finally, when MH TP includes a third MH header, this indicates that the MH payload<br>
includes only the mobile service data. In the example shown in FIG. 3, the RS frame is<br>
assigned with IP datagrams (IP datagram 1 and IP datagram 2) for two service types.<br>
(107]<br>
[108]	Data Transmission Structure<br>
[109]	FIG. 4 illustrates a structure of a MH frame for transmitting and receiving mobile<br>
service data according to the present invention. In the example shown in FIG. 4, one<br>
MH frame consists of 5 sub-frames, wherein each sub-frame includes 16 slots. In this<br>
case, the MH frame according to the present invention includes 5 sub-frames and 80<br>
slots. Also, in a packet level, one slot is configured of 156 data packets (i.e., transport<br>
stream packets), and in a symbol level, one slot is configured of 156 data segments.<br>
Herein, the size of one slot corresponds to one half (1/2) of a VSB field. More<br>
specifically, since one 207-byte data packet has the same amount of data as a data<br>
segment, a data packet prior to being interleaved may also be used as a data segment.<br>
At this point, two VSB fields are grouped to form a VSB frame.<br>
[110]	FIG. 5 illustrates an exemplary structure of a VSB frame, wherein one VSB frame<br>
consists of 2 VSB fields (i.e., an odd field and an even field). Herein, each VSB field<br>
includes a field synchronization segment and 312 data segments. The slot corresponds<br>
to a basic time unit for multiplexing the mobile service data and the main service data.<br>
Herein, one slot may either include the mobile service data or be configured only of the<br>
main service data. If the first 118 data packets within the slot correspond to a data<br>
group, the remaining 38 data packets become the main service data packets. In another<br>
example, when no data group exists in a slot, the corresponding slot is configured of<br>
156 main service data packets. Meanwhile, when the slots are assigned to a VSB<br>
frame, an off-set exists for each assigned position.<br>
[111]	FIG. 6 illustrates a mapping example of the positions to which the first 4 slots of a<br>
sub- frame are assigned with respect to a VSB frame in a spatial area. And, FIG. 7 il-<br>
lustrates a mapping example of the positions to which the first 4 slots of a sub-frame<br>
are assigned with respect to a VSB frame in a chronological (or time) area. Referring<br>
to FIG. 6 and FIG. 7, a 38th data packet (TS packet #37) of a 1st slot (Slot #0) is<br>
mapped to the 1st data packet of an odd VSB field. A 38th data packet (TS packet #37)<br>
of a 2nd slot (Slot #1) is mapped to the 157th data packet of an odd VSB field. Also, a<br>
 <br>
38th data packet (TS packet #37) of a 3rd slot (Slot #2) is mapped to the 1st data<br>
packet of an even VSB field. And, a 38th data packet (TS packet #37) of a 4th slot<br>
(Slot #3) is mapped to the 157th data packet of an even VSB field. Similarly, the<br>
remaining 12 slots within the corresponding sub-frame are mapped in the subsequent<br>
VSB frames using the same method.<br>
[112]	FIG. 8 illustrates an exemplary assignement order of data groups being assigned to<br>
one of 5 sub-frames, wherein the 5 sub-frames configure an MH frame. For example,<br>
the method of assigning data groups may be identically applied to all MH frames or<br>
differently applied to each MH frame. Furthermore, the method of assinging data<br>
groups may be identically applied to all sub-frames or differently applied to each sub-<br>
frame. At this point, when it is assumed that the data groups are assigned using the<br>
same method in all sub-frames of the corresponding MH frame, the total number of<br>
data groups being assigned to an MH frame is equal to a multiple of '5'. According to<br>
the embodiment of the present invention, a plurality of consecutive data groups is<br>
assigned to be spaced as far apart from one another as possible within the MH frame.<br>
Thus, the system can be capable of responding promptly and effectively to any burst<br>
error that may occur within a sub-frame.<br>
[113]	For example, when it is assumed that 3 data groups are assigned to a sub-frame,<br>
the data groups are assigned to a 1st slot (Slot #0), a 5th slot (Slot #4), and a 9th slot<br>
(Slot #8) in the sub-frame, respectively. FIG. 8 illustrates an example of assigning 16<br>
data groups in one sub-frame using the above-described pattern (or rule). In other<br>
words, each data group is serially assigned to 16 slots corresponding to the following<br>
numbers: 0, 8,4, 12, 1,9, 5, 13,2, 10, 6,14,3, 11, 7, and 15. Equation 1 below shows<br>
the above-described rule (or pattern) for assigning data groups in a sub-frame.<br>
[114]<br>
[115] [Math Figure 1]<br>
[116] j = (4i + O) mod 16<br>
[117] Herein, O = 0 if i
[118] 0 = 2 else if i
[119] 0=1 else if i
[120] 0 = 3 else.<br>
[121] Herein, j indicates the slot number within a sub-frame. The value of j may range from<br>
0 to 15 (i.e.,). Also, variable i indicates the data group number. The value of i may<br>
range from 0 to 15 (i.e.,).<br>
[ 122] In the present invneiton, a collection of data groups included in a MH frame will be<br>
referred to as a "parade". Based upon the RS frame mode, the parade transmits data of<br>
at least one specific RS frame. The mobile service data within one RS frame may be<br>
assigned either to all of regions A/B/C/D within the corresponding data group, or to at<br>
 <br>
least one of regions A/B/C/D. In the embodiment of the present invention, the mobile<br>
service data within one RS frame may be assigned either to all of regions A/B/C/D, or<br>
to at least one of regions A/B and regions C/D. If the mobile service data are assigned<br>
to the latter case (i.e., one of regions A/B and regions C/D), the RS frame being<br>
assigned to regions A/B and the RS frame being assigned to regions C/D within the<br>
corresponding data group are different from one another.<br>
[ 123] According to the embodiment of the present invention, the RS frame being assigned<br>
to regions A/B within the corresponding data group will be referred to as a "primary<br>
RS frame", and the RS frame being assigned to regions C/D within the corresponding<br>
data group will be referred to as a "secondary RS frame", for simplicity. Also, the<br>
primary RS frame and the secondary RS frame form (or configure) one parade. More<br>
specifically, when the mobile service data within one RS frame are assigned either to<br>
all of regions A/B/C/D within the corresponding data group, one parade transmits one<br>
RS frame. Conversely, when the mobile service data within one RS frame are assigned<br>
either to at least one of regions A/B and regions C/D, one parade may transmit up to 2<br>
RS frames. More specifically, the RS frame mode indicates whether a parade transmits<br>
one RS frame, or whether the parade transmits two RS frames. Such RS frame mode is<br>
transmitted as the above-described TPC data. Table 1 below shows an example of the<br>
RS frame mode.<br>
[124] Table 1<br>
 <br>
[125] Table 1 illustrates an example of allocating 2 bits in order to indicate the RS frame<br>
mode. For example, referring to Table 1, when the RS frame mode value is equal to<br>
'00', this indicates that one parade transmits one RS frame. And, when the RS frame<br>
mode value is equal to '01', this indicates that one parade transmits two RS frames,<br>
i.e., the primary RS frame and the secondary RS frame. More specifically, when the<br>
 <br>
RS frame mode value is equal to '01', data of the primary RS frame for regions A/B<br>
are assigned and transmitted to regions A/B of the corresponding data group. Similarly,<br>
data of the secondary RS frame for regions C/D are assigned and transmitted to regions<br>
C/D of the corresponding data group.<br>
[ 126 ] As described in the assignment of data groups, the parades are also assigned to be<br>
spaced as far apart from one another as possible within the sub-frame. Thus, the system<br>
can be capable of responding promptly and effectively to any burst error that may<br>
occur within a sub-frame. Furthermore, the method of assigning parades may be<br>
identically applied to all MH frames or differently applied to each MH frame.<br>
According to the embodiment of the present invention, the parades may be assigned<br>
differently for each MH frame and identically for all sub-frames within an MH frame.<br>
More specifically, the MH frame structure may vary by MH frame units. Thus, an<br>
ensemble rate may be adjusted on a more frequent and flexible basis.<br>
[127] FIG. 9 illustrates an example of multiple data groups of a single parade being<br>
assigned (or allocated) to an MH frame. More specifically, FIG. 9 illustrates an<br>
example of a plurality of data groups included in a single parade, wherein the number<br>
of data groups included in a sub-frame is equal to '3', being allocated to an MH frame.<br>
Referring to FIG. 9, 3 data groups are sequentially assigned to a sub-frame at a cycle<br>
period of 4 slots. Accordingly, when this process is equally performed in the 5 sub-<br>
frames included in the corresponding MH frame, 15 data groups are assigned to a<br>
single MH frame. Herein, the 15 data groups correspond to data groups included in a<br>
parade. Therefore, since one sub-frame is configured of 4 VSB frame, and since 3 data<br>
groups are included in a sub-frame, the data group of the corresponding parade is not<br>
assigned to one of the 4 VSB frames within a sub-frame.<br>
[ 128] For example, when it is assumed that one parade transmits one RS frame, and that a<br>
RS frame encoder (not shown) included in the transmitting system performs RS-<br>
encoding on the corresponding RS frame, thereby adding 24 bytes of parity data to the<br>
corresponding RS frame and transmitting the processed RS frame, the parity data<br>
occupy approximately 11.37% (=24/(187+24)xl00) of the total code word length.<br>
Meanwhile, when one sub-frame includes 3 data groups, and when the data groups<br>
included in the parade are assigned, as shown in FIG. 9, a total of 15 data groups form<br>
an RS frame. Accordingly, even when an error occurs in an entire data group due to a<br>
burst noise within a channel, the percentile is merely 6.67% (=1/15x100). Therefore,<br>
the receiving system may correct all errors by performing an erasure RS decoding<br>
process. More specifically, when the erasure RS decoding is performed, a number of<br>
channel errors corresponding to the number of RS parity bytes may be corrected. By<br>
doing so, the receiving system may correct the error of at least one data group within<br>
one parade. Thus, the minimum burst noise length correctable by a RS frame is over 1<br>
 <br>
VSB frame.<br>
[1291 Meanwhile, when data groups of a parade are assigned as shown in FIG. 9, either<br>
main service data may be assigned between each data group, or data groups corre-<br>
sponding to different parades may be assigned between each data group. More<br>
specifically, data groups corresponding to multiple parades may be assigned to one<br>
MH frame. Basically, the method of assigning data groups corresponding to multiple<br>
parades is very similar to the method of assigning data groups corresponding to a<br>
single parade. In other words, data groups included in other parades that are to be<br>
assigned to an MH frame are also respectively assigned according to a cycle period of<br>
4 slots. At this point, data groups of a different parade may be sequentially assigned to<br>
the respective slots in a circular method. Herein, the data groups are assigned to slots<br>
starting from the ones to which data groups of the previous parade have not yet been<br>
assigned. For example, when it is assumed that data groups corresponding to a parade<br>
are assigned as shown in FIG. 9, data groups corresponding to the next parade may be<br>
assigned to a sub-frame starting either from the 12th slot of a sub-frame. However, this<br>
is merely exemplary. In another example, the data groups of the next parade may also<br>
be sequentially assigned to a different slot within a sub-frame at a cycle period of 4<br>
slots starting from the 3rd slot.<br>
[ 130] FIG. 10 illustrates an example of transmitting 3 parades (Parade #0, Parade #1, and<br>
Parade #2) to an MH frame. More specifically, FIG. 10 illustrates an example of<br>
transmitting parades included in one of 5 sub-frames, wherein the 5 sub-frames<br>
configure one MH frame. When the 1st parade (Parade #0) includes 3 data groups for<br>
each sub-frame, the positions of each data groups within the sub-frames may be<br>
obtained by substituting values '0' to '2' for i in Equation 1. More specifically, the<br>
data groups of the 1st parade (Parade #0) are sequentially assigned to the 1st, 5th, and<br>
9th slots (Slot #0, Slot #4, and Slot #8) within the sub-frame. Also, when the 2nd<br>
parade includes 2 data groups for each sub-frame, the positions of each data groups<br>
within the sub-frames may be obtained by substituting values '3' and '4' for i in<br>
Equation 1. More specifically, the data groups of the 2nd parade (Parade #1) are se-<br>
quentially assigned to the 2nd and 12th slots (Slot #3 and Slot #11) within the sub-<br>
frame. Finally, when the 3rd parade includes 2 data groups for each sub-frame, the<br>
positions of each data groups within the sub-frames may be obtained by substituting<br>
values '5' and '6' for i in Equation 1. More specifically, the data groups of the 3rd<br>
parade (Parade #2) are sequentially assigned to the 7th and 11th slots (Slot #6 and Slot<br>
#10) within the sub-frame.<br>
[131] As described above, data groups of multiple parades may be assigned to a single MH<br>
frame, and, in each sub-frame, the data groups are serially allocated to a group space<br>
having 4 slots from left to right. Therefore, a number of groups of one parade per sub-<br>
 <br>
frame (NoG) may correspond to any one integer from '1' to '8'. Herein, since one MH<br>
frame includes 5 sub-frames, the total number of data groups within a parade that can<br>
be allocated to an MH frame may correspond to any one multiple of '5' ranging from<br>
'5' to '40'.<br>
[132] FIG. 11 illustrates an example of expanding the assignment process of 3 parades,<br>
shown in FIG. 10, to 5 sub-frames within an MH frame. FIG. 12 illustrates a data<br>
transmission structure according to an embodiment of the present invention, wherein<br>
signaling data are included in a data group so as to be transmitted. As described above,<br>
an MH frame is divided into 5 sub-frames. Data groups corresponding to a plurality of<br>
parades co-exist in each sub-frame. Herein, the data groups corresponding to each<br>
parade are grouped by MH fram units, thereby configuring a single parade.<br>
[ 133] The data structure shown in FIG. 12 includes 3 parades, one ESG dedicated channel<br>
(EDC) parade (i.e., parade with NoG=l), and 2 service parades (i.e., parade with<br>
NoG=4 and parade with NoG=3). Also, a predetermined portion of each data group<br>
(i.e., 37 bytes/data group) is used for delivering (or sending) FIC information as-<br>
sociated with mobile service data, wherein the FIC information is separately encoded<br>
from the RS-encoding process. The FIC region assigned to each data group consists of<br>
one FIC segments. Herein, each segment is interleaved by MH sub-frame units,<br>
thereby configuring an FIC body, which corresponds to a completed FIC transmission<br>
structure. However, whenever required, each segment may be interleaved by MH<br>
frame units and not by MH sub-frame units, thereby being completed in MH frame<br>
units.<br>
[134] Meanwhile, the concept of an MH ensemble is applied in the embodiment of the<br>
present invention, thereby defining a collection (or group) of services. Each MH<br>
ensemble carries the same QoS and is coded with the same FEC code. Also, each MH<br>
ensemble has the same unique identifier (i.e., ensemble ID) and corresponds to con-<br>
secutiveRS frames. As shown in FIG. 12, the FIC segment corresponding to each data<br>
group described service information of an MH ensemble to which the corresponding<br>
data group belongs. When FIC segments within a sub-frame are grouped and dein-<br>
terleved, all service information of a physical channel through which the corresponding<br>
FICs are transmitted may be obtained. Therefore, the receiving system may be able to<br>
acquire the channel information of the corresponding physical channel, after being<br>
processed with physical channel tuning, during a sub-frame period. Furthermore, FIG.<br>
12 illustrates a structure further including a separate EDC parade apart from the service<br>
parade and wherein electronic service guide (ESG) data are transmitted in the 1st slot<br>
of each sub-frame.<br>
[135]<br>
[136] Hierarchical Signaling Structure<br>
 <br>
[137] FIG. 13 illustrates a hierarchical signaling structure according to an embodiment of<br>
the present invention. As shown in FIG. 13, the mobile broadcasting techonology<br>
according to the embodiment of the present invention adopts a signaling method using<br>
FIC and SMT. In the description of the present invention, the signaling structure will<br>
be referred to as a hierarchical signaling structure. Hereinafter, a detailed description<br>
on how the receiving system accesses a virtual channel via FIC and SMT will now be<br>
given with reference to FIG. 13. The FIC body defined in an MH transport (M1)<br>
identifies the physical location of each the data stream for each virtual channel and<br>
provides very high level descriptions of each virtual channel. Being MH ensemble<br>
level signaling information, the service map table (SMT) provides MH ensemble level<br>
signaling information. The SMT provides the IP access information of each virtual<br>
channel belonging to the respective MH ensemble within which the SMT is carried.<br>
The SMT also provides all IP stream component level information required for the<br>
virtual channel service acquisition.<br>
[138] Referring to FIG. 13, each MH ensemble (i.e., Ensemble 0, Ensemble 1,...,<br>
Ensemble K) includes a stream information on each associated (or corresponding)<br>
virtual channel (e.g., virtual channel 0 IP stream, virtual channel 1 IP stream, and<br>
virtual channel 2 IP stream). For example, Ensemble 0 includes virtual channel 0 IP<br>
stream and virtual channel 1 IP stream. And, each MH ensemble includes diverse in-<br>
formation on the associated virtual channel (i.e., Virtual Channel 0 Table Entry,<br>
Virtual Channel 0 Access Info, Virtual Channel 1 Table Entry, Virtual Channel 1<br>
Access Info, Virtual Channel 2 Table Entry, Virtual Channel 2 Access Info, Virtual<br>
Channel N Table Entry, Virtual Channel N Access Info, and so on). The FIC body<br>
payload includes information on MH ensembles (e.g., ensemblejd field, and referred<br>
to as "ensemble location" in FIG. 13) and information on a virtual channel associated<br>
with the corresponding MH ensemble (e.g., when such information corresponds to a<br>
major_channel_num field and a minor_channel_num field, the information is<br>
expressed as Virtual Channel 0, Virtual Channel 1,..., Virtual Channel N in FIG. 13).<br>
[ 139] The application of the signaling structure in the receiving system will now be<br>
described in detail. When a user selects a channel he or she wishes to view<br>
(hereinafter, the user-selected channel will be referred to as "channel B" for<br>
simplicity), the receiving system first parses the received FIC. Then, the receiving<br>
system acquires information on an MH ensemble (i.e., ensemble location), which is as-<br>
sociated with the virtual channel corresponding to channel 0 (hereinafter, the corre-<br>
sponding MH ensemble will be referred to as "MH ensemble 0" for simplicity). By<br>
acquiring slots only corresponding to the MH ensemble 8 using the time-slicing<br>
method, the receiving system configures ensemble 0. The ensemble 0 configured as<br>
described above, includes an SMT on the associated virtual channels (including<br>
 <br>
channel 8) and IP streams on the corresponding virtual channels. Therefore, the<br>
receiving system uses the SMT included in the MH ensemble 0 in order to acquire<br>
various information on channel 6 (e.g., Virtual Channel 0 Table Entry) and stream<br>
access information on channel 0 (e.g., Virtual Channel 0 Access Info). The receiving<br>
system uses the stream access information on channel 0 to receive only the associated<br>
IP streams, thereby providing channel 0 services to the user.<br>
[140]<br>
[141] Fast Information Channel (FIC)<br>
[142) The digital broadcast receiving system according to the present invention adopts the<br>
fast information channel (FIC) for a faster access to a service that is currently being<br>
broadcasted. More specifically, the FIC handler 215 of FIG. 1 parses the FIC body,<br>
which corresponds to an FIC transmission structure, and outputs the parsed result to<br>
the physical adaptation control signal handler 216. FIG. 14 illustrates an exemplary<br>
FIC body format according to an embodiment of the present invention. According to<br>
the embodiment of the present invention, the FTC format consists of an FIC body<br>
header and an FIC body payload.<br>
[ 143] Meanwhile, according to the embodiment of the present invention, data are<br>
transmitted through the FIC body header and the FIC body payload in FIC segment<br>
units. Each FIC segment has the size of 37 bytes, and each FIC segment consists of a<br>
2-byte FIC segment header and a 35-byte FIC segment payload. More specifically, an<br>
FIC body configured of an FIC body header and an FIC body payload, is segmented in<br>
units of 35 data bytes, which are then carried in at least one FIC segment within the<br>
FIC segment payload, so as to be transmitted. In the description of the present<br>
invention, an example of inserting one FIC segment in one data group, which is then<br>
transmitted, will be given. In this case, the receiving system receives a slot corre-<br>
sponding to each data group by using a time-slicing method.<br>
[ 144] The signaling decoder 190 included in the receiving system shown in FIG. 1 collects<br>
each FIC segment inserted in each data group. Then, the signaling decoder 190 uses<br>
the collected FIC segments to created a single FIC body. Thereafter, the signaling<br>
decoder 190 performs a decoding process on the FIC body payload of the created FIC<br>
body, so that the decoded FIC body payload corresponds to an encoded result of a<br>
signaling encoder (not shown) included in the transmitting system. Subsequently, the<br>
decoded FIC body payload is outputted to the FIC handler 215. The FIC handler 215<br>
parses the FIC data included in the FIC body payload, and then outputs the parsed FIC<br>
data to the physical adaptation control signal handler 216. The physical adaptation<br>
control signal handler 216 uses the inputted FIC data to perform processes associated<br>
with MH ensembles, virtual channels, SMTs, and so on.<br>
[145] According to an embodiment of the present invention, when an FIC body is<br>
 <br>
segmented, and when the size of the last segmented portion is smaller than 35 data<br>
bytes, it is assumed that the lacking number of data bytes in the FIC segment payload<br>
is completed with by adding the same number of stuffing bytes therein, so that the size<br>
of the last FIC segment can be equal to 35 data bytes. However, it is apparent that the<br>
above-described data byte values (i.e., 37 bytes for the FIC segment, 2 bytes for the<br>
FIC segment header, and 35 bytes for the FIC segment payload) are merely exemplary,<br>
and will, therefore, not limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
[146] FIG. 15 illustrates an exemplary bit stream syntax structure with respect to an FIC<br>
segment according to an embodiment of the present invention. Herein, the FIC<br>
segment signifies a unit used for transmitting the FIC data. The FIC segment consists<br>
of an FIC segment header and an FIC segment payload. Referring to FIG. 15, the FIC<br>
segment payload corresponds to the portion starting from the 'for' loop statement.<br>
Meanwhile, the FIC segment header may include a FIC_type field, an error_indicator<br>
field, an FIC_seg_number field, and an FIC_last_seg_number field. A detailed de-<br>
scription of each field will now be given.<br>
[147] The FIC_type field is a 2-bit field indicating the type of the corresponding FIC. The<br>
error_indicator field is a 1-bit field, which indicates whether or not an error has<br>
occurred within the FIC segment during data transmission. If an error has occurred, the<br>
value of the error_indicator field is set to '1'. More specifically, when an error that has<br>
failed to be recovered still remains during the configuration process of the FIC<br>
segment, the error_indicator field value is set to '1'. The error_indicator field enables<br>
the receiving system to recognize the presence of an error within the FTC data. The<br>
FIC_seg_number field is a 4-bit field. Herein, when a single FIC body is divided into a<br>
plurality of FIC segments and transmitted, the FIC„seg_number field indicates the<br>
number of the corresponding FIC segment. Finally, the FIC_last_seg_number field is<br>
also a 4-bit field. The FIC_last_seg_number field indicates the number of the last FIC<br>
segment within the corresponding FIC body.<br>
[148] FIG. 16 illustrates an exemplary bit stream syntax structure with respect to a payload<br>
of an FIC segment according to the present invention, when an FIC type field value is<br>
equal to '0'. According to the embodiment of the present invention, the payload of the<br>
FIC segment is divided into 3 different regions. A first region of the FIC segment<br>
payload exists only when the FIC_seg_number field value is equal to '0'. Herein, the<br>
first region may include a current_next_indicator field, an ESG_version field, and a<br>
transport_stream_id field. However, depending upon the embodiment of the present<br>
invention, it may be assumed that each of the 3 fields exists regardless of the<br>
FIC_seg_number field.<br>
[149] The current_next_indicator field is a 16-bit field. The current_next_indicator field<br>
acts as an indicator identifying whether the corresponding FIC data carry MH<br>
 <br>
ensemble configuration information of an MH frame including the current FIC<br>
segment, or whether the corresponding FIC data cany MH ensemble configuration in-<br>
formation of a next MH frame. The ESG_version field is a 5-bit field indicating ESG<br>
version information. Herein, by providing version information on the service guide<br>
providing channel of the corresponding ESG, the ESG_version field enables the<br>
receiving system to notify whether or not the corresponding ESG has been updated.<br>
Finally, the transport_stream _id field is a 16-bit field acting as a unique identifier of a<br>
broadcast stream through which the corresponding FIC segment is being transmitted.<br>
[150] A second region of the FIC segment payload corresponds to an ensemble loop<br>
region, which includes an ensemble_id field, an SI_version field, and a num_channel<br>
field. More specifically, the ensemble_id field is an 8-bit field indicating identifiers of<br>
an MH ensemble through which MH services are transmitted. The MH services will be<br>
described in more detail in a later process. Herein, the ensemble_id field binds the MH<br>
services and the MH ensemble. The SI_version field is a 4-bit field indicating version<br>
information of SI data included in the corresponding ensemble, which is being<br>
transmitted within the RS frame. Finally, the num_channel field is an 8-bit field in-<br>
dicating the number of virtual channel being transmitted via the corresponding<br>
ensemble.<br>
[151] A third region of the FIC segment payload a channel loop region, which includes a<br>
channel_type field, a channel_activity field, a CA_indicator field, a<br>
stand_alone_service__indicator field, a major_channel_num field, and a<br>
minor_channei_num field. The channel__type field is a 5-bit field indicating a service<br>
type of the corresponding virtual channel. For example, the channel_type field may<br>
indicates an audio/video channel, an audio/video and data channel, an audio-only<br>
channel, a data-only channel, a file download channel, an ESG delivery channel, a no-<br>
tification channel, and so on. The channel_activity field is a 2-bit field indicating<br>
activity information of the corresponding virtual channel. More specifically, the<br>
channel_activity field may indicate whether the current virtual channel is providing the<br>
current service.<br>
[152] The CA_indicator field is a 1-bit field indicating whether or not a conditional access<br>
(CA) is applied to the current virtual channel. The stand_alone_service_indicator field<br>
is also a 1-bit field, which indicates whether the service of the corresponding virtual<br>
channel corresponds to a stand alone service. The major_channel_num field is an 8-bit<br>
field indicating a major channel number of the corresponding virtual channel. Finally,<br>
the minor_channel_num field is also an 8-bit field indicating a minor channel number<br>
of the corresponding virtual channel.<br>
[153]<br>
[154] Service Table Map<br>
 <br>
[155] FIG. 17 illustrates an exemplary bit stream syntax structure of a service map table<br>
(hereinafter referred to as "SMT") according to the present invention. According to the<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the SMT is configured in an MPEG-2 private<br>
section format. However, this will not limit the scope and spirit of the present<br>
invention. The SMT according to the embodiment of the present invention includes<br>
desription information for each virtual channel within a single MH ensemble. And, ad-<br>
ditional information may further be included in each descriptor area. Herein, the SMT<br>
according to the embodiment of the present invention includes at least one field and is<br>
transmitted from the transmitting system to the receiving system.<br>
[ 1561 As described in FIG. 3, the SMT section may be transmitted by being included in the<br>
MH TP within the RS frame. In this case, each of the RS frame decoders 170 and 180,<br>
shown in FIG. 1, decodes the inputted RS frame, respectively. Then, each of the<br>
decoded RS frames is outputted to the respective RS frame handler 211 and 212.<br>
Thereafter, each RS frame handler 211 and 212 identifies the inputted RS frame by<br>
row units, so as to create an MH TP, thereby outputting the created MH TP to the MH<br>
TP handler 213. When it is determined that the corresponding MH TP includes an<br>
SMT section based upon the header in each of the inputted MH TP, the MH TP<br>
handler 213 parses the corresponding SMT section, so as to output the SI data within<br>
the parsed SMT section to the physical adaptation control signal handler 216.<br>
However, this is limited to when the SMT is not encapsulated to IP datagrams.<br>
[157] Meanwhile, when the SMT is not encapsulated to IP datagrams, and when it is de-<br>
termined that the corresponding MH TP includes an SMT section based upon the<br>
header in each of the inputted MH TP, the MH TP handler 213 outputs the SMT<br>
section to the IP network stack 220. Accordingly, the IP network stack 220 performs IP<br>
and UDP processes on the inputted SMT section and, then, outputs the processed SMT<br>
section to the SI handler 240. The SI handler 240 parses the inputted SMT section and<br>
controls the system so that the parsed SI data can be stroed in the storage unit 290. The<br>
following corresponds to example of the fields that may be transmitted through the<br>
SMT.<br>
[158] The table_id field corresponds to an 8-bit unsigned integer number, which indicates<br>
the type of table section. The table_id field allows the corresponding table to be<br>
defined as the service map table (SMT). The ensemble_id field is an 8-bit unsigned<br>
integer field, which corresponds to an ID value associated to the corresponding MH<br>
ensemble. Herein, the ensemble_id field may be assigned with a value ranging from<br>
range '0x00' to '0x3F'. It is preferable that the value of the ensemble_id field is<br>
derived from the parade_id of the TPC data, which is carried from the baseband<br>
processor of MH physical layer subsystem. When the corresponding MH ensemble is<br>
transmitted through (or carried over) the primary RS frame, a value of '0' may be used<br>
 <br>
for the most significant bit (MSB), and the remaining 7 bits are used as the parade_id<br>
value of the associated MH parade (i.e., for the least significant 7 bits). Alternatively,<br>
when the corresponding MH ensemble is transmitted through (or carried over) the<br>
secondary RS frame, a value of '1' may be used for the most significant bit (MSB).<br>
[159] The num_channels field is an 8-bit field, which specifies the number of virtual<br>
channels in the corresponding SMT section. Meanwhile, the SMT according to the em-<br>
bodimentof the present invention provides information on a plurality of virtual<br>
channels using the 'for' loop statement. The major_channel_num field corresponds to<br>
an 8-bit field, which represents the major channel number associated with the corre-<br>
sponding virtual channel. Herein, the major_channel_num field may be assigned with a<br>
value ranging from '0x00' to 'OxFF'. The minor_channel_num field corresponds to an<br>
8-bit field, which represents the minor channel number associated with the corre-<br>
sponding virtual channel. Herein, the minor_channel_num field may be assigned with<br>
a value ranging from '0x00' to '0xFF'.<br>
[160] The short_channel_name field indicates the short name of the virtual channel. The<br>
service_id field is a 16-bit unsigned integer number (or value), which identifies the<br>
virtual channel service. The service_type field is a 6-bit enumerated type field, which<br>
designates the type of service carried in the corresponding virtual channel as defined in<br>
Table 2 below.<br>
[161] Table 2<br>
 <br>
[162] The virtual_channel_activity field is a 2-bit enumerated field identifying the activity<br>
 <br>
status of the corresponding virtual channel. When the most significant bit (MSB) of the<br>
virtual_channel_activity field is '1', the virtual channel is active, and when the most<br>
significant bit (MSB) of the virtual_channel_activity field is '0', the virtual channel is<br>
inactive. Also, when the least significant bit (LSB) of the virtual_channel_activity field<br>
is '1', the virtual channel is hidden (when set to 1), and when the least significant bit<br>
(LSB) of the virtual_channel_activity field is '0', the virtual channel is not hidden. The<br>
num_components field is a 5-bit field, which specifies the number of IP stream<br>
components in the corresponding virtual channel. The IP_version_flag field cor-<br>
responds to a 1-bit indicator. More specifically, when the value of the IP_version_fiag<br>
field is set to ' 1', this indicates that a source_IP_address field, a<br>
virtual_channel_target_IP_address field, and a component_target_IP_address field are<br>
IPv6 addresses. Alternatively, when the value of the IP_version_flag field is set to '0',<br>
this indicates that the source_IP_address field, the virtual__channel_target_IP_address<br>
field, and the component_target_IP_address field are IPv4.<br>
[ 163] The source_IP_address_flag field is a 1-bit Boolean flag, which indicates, when set,<br>
that a source IP address of the corresponding virtual channel exist for a specific<br>
multicast source. The virtual_channel_target_IP_address_flag field is a 1-bit Boolean<br>
flag, which indicates, when set, that the corresponding IP stream component is<br>
delivered through IP datagrams with target IP addresses different from the<br>
virtual_channel_target_IP_address. Therefore, when the flag is set, the receiving<br>
system (or receiver) uses the component_target_IP_address as the target_IP_address in<br>
order to access the corresponding IP stream component. Accordingly, the receiving<br>
system (or receiver) may ignore the virtuai_channel_target_IP_address field included<br>
in the num_channels loop.<br>
[ 164] The source_IP_address field corresponds to a 32-bit or 128-bit field. Herein, the<br>
source_IP_address field will be significant (or present), when the value of the<br>
source_IP_address_flag field is set to '1'. However, when the value of the<br>
source_IP_address_flag field is set to '0', the source_IP_address field will become in-<br>
significant (or absent). More specifically, when the source_IP_address_flag field value<br>
is set to ' 1', and when the IP_version_flag field value is set to '0', the<br>
source_IP_address field indicates a 32-bit IPv4 address, which shows the source of the<br>
corresponding virtual channel. Alternatively, when the IP_version_flag field value is<br>
set to '1', the source_IP_address field indicates a 128-bit IPv6 address, which shows<br>
the source of the corresponding virtual channel.<br>
[ 165] The virtual_channel_target_IP_address field also corresponds to a 32-bit or 128-bit<br>
field. Herein, the virtual_channel_target_IP_address field will be significant (or<br>
present), when the value of the virtual_channel_target_IP_address_flag field is set to<br>
' 1'. However, when the value of the virtual_channel_target_IP_address_flag field is set<br>
 <br>
to '0', the virtual_channel_target_IP_address field will become insignificant (or<br>
absent). More specifically, when the virtual_channel_target_IP_address_flag field<br>
value is set to ' 1', and when the IP_version_flag field value is set to '0', the<br>
virtual_channel_target_IP_address field indicates a 32-bit target IPv4 address as-<br>
sociated to the corresponding virtual channel. Alternatively, when the<br>
virtual_channel_target_IP_address_flag field value is set to '1', and when the<br>
IP_version_flag field value is set to '1', the virtual_channel_target_IP_address field<br>
indicates a 64-bit target IPv6 address associated to the corresponding virtual channel,<br>
if the vinual_channel_target_IP_address field is insignificant (or absent), the<br>
component_target_IP__address field within the num_channels loop should become sig-<br>
nificant (or present). And, in order to enable the receiving system to access the IP<br>
stream component, the component__target_IP„address field should be used.<br>
[166] Meanwhile, the SMT according to the embodiment of the present invention uses a<br>
'for' loop statement in order to provide information on a plurality of components.<br>
Herein, the RTP_payload_rype field, which is assigned with 7 bits, identifies the<br>
encoding format of the component based upon Table 3 shown below. When the IP<br>
stream component is not encapsulated to RTP, the RTP_payload_type field shall be<br>
ignored (or deprecated). Table 3 below shows an example of an RTP payload type.<br>
[167] Table 3<br>
[Table 3]<br>
 <br>
[168] The component_target_IP_address_flag field is a 1-bit Boolean flag, which indicates,<br>
when set, that the corresponding IP stream component is delivered through IP<br>
datagrams with target IP addresses different from the<br>
virtual_channel_target_IP_address. Furthermore, when the<br>
component_target_IP_address_flag is set, the receiving system (or receiver) uses the<br>
component_target_IP_address field as the target IP address for accessind the corre-<br>
sponding IP stream component. Accordingly, the receiving system (or receiver) will<br>
ignore the virtual_channel_target_IP_address field included in the num„channels loop.<br>
The component_target_IP_address field corresponds to a 32-bit or 128-bit field.<br>
Herein, when the value of the IP_version_flag field is set to '0', the<br>
 <br>
component_target__IP_address field indicates a 32-bit target IPv4 address associated to<br>
the corresponding IP stream component. And, when the value of the IP_version_flag<br>
field is set to '1', the cornponent_target_IP_address field indicates a 128-bit target<br>
IPv6 address associated to the corresponding IP stream component,<br>
[169] The port_num_count field is a 6-bit field, which indicates the number of UDP ports<br>
associated with the corresponding IP stream component. A target UDP port number<br>
value starts from the target_UDP_port_num field value and increases (or is in-<br>
cremented) by 1. For the RTP stream, the target UDP port number should start from<br>
the target_UDP_port_num field value and shall increase (or be incremented) by 2. This<br>
is to incorporate RTCP streams associated with the RTP streams.<br>
[170] The target_UDP_port_num field is a 16-bit unsigned integer field, which represents<br>
the target UDP port number for the corresponding IP stream component. When used<br>
for RTP streams, the value of the target _UDP_port_num field shall correspond to an<br>
even number. And, the next higher value shall represent the target UDP port number of<br>
the associated RTCP stream. The component_level_descriptor() represents zero or<br>
more descriptors providing additional information on the corresponding IP stream<br>
component. The virtual_channel_level_descriptor() represents zero or more descriptors<br>
providing additional information for the corresponding virtual channel. The<br>
ensembleJevel_descriptor() represents zero or more descriptors providing additional<br>
information for the MH ensemble, which is described by the corresponding SMT.<br>
[171 ] FIG. 18 illustrates an exemplary bit stream syntax structure of an MH audio de-<br>
scriptor according to the present invention. When at least one audio service is present<br>
as a component of the current event, the MH_audio_descriptor() shall be used as a<br>
component_level_descriptor of the SMT. The MH_audio_descriptor() may be capable<br>
of informing the system of the audio language type and stereo mode status. If there is<br>
no audio service associated with the current event, then it is preferable that the<br>
MH_audio_descriptor() is considered to be insignificant (or absent) for the current<br>
event. Each field shown in the bit stream syntax of FIG. 18 will now be described in<br>
detail.<br>
[172] The descriptor_tag field is an 8-bit unsigned integer having a TBD value, which<br>
indicates that the corresponding descriptor is the MH_audio_descriptor(). The de-<br>
scriptorjength field is also an 8-bit unsigned integer, which indicates the length (in<br>
bytes) of the portion immediately following the descriptorjength field up to the end of<br>
the MH_audio_descriptor(). The channel_configuration field corresponds to an 8-bit<br>
field indicating the number and configuration of audio channels. The values ranging<br>
from ' 1' to '6' respectively indicate the the number and configuration of audio<br>
channels as given for "Default bit stream index number" in Table 42 of ISO/TEC<br>
13818-7:2006. All other values indicate that the number and configuration of audio<br>
 <br>
channels are undefined.<br>
[ 173] The sample_rate_code field is a 3-bit field, which indicates the sample rate of the<br>
encoded audio data. Herein, the indication may correspond to one specific sample rate,<br>
or may correspond to a set of values that include the sample rate of the encoded audio<br>
data as defined in Table A3.3 of ATSC A/52B. The bit_rate__code field corresponds to<br>
a 6-bit field. Herein, among the 6 bits, the lower 5 bits indicate a nominal bit rate.<br>
More specifically, when the most significant bit (MSB) is '0', the corresponding bit<br>
rate is exact. On the other hand, when the most significant bit (MSB) is '0', the bit rate<br>
corresponds to an upper limit as defined in Table A3.4 of ATSC A/53B. The<br>
ISO_639_language_code field is a 24-bit (i.e., 3-byte) field indicating the language<br>
used for the audio stream component, in conformance with ISO 639.2/B [x]. When a<br>
specific language is not present in the corresponding audio stream component, the<br>
value of each byte will be set to '0x00'.<br>
[ 174] FIG. 19 illustrates an exemplary bit stream syntax structure of an MH RTP payload<br>
type descriptor according to the present invention. The<br>
MH_RTP_payload_type_descriptor() specifies the RTP payload type. Yet, the<br>
MH_RTP_payload_type_descriptor() exists only when the dynamic value of the<br>
RTP_payload_type field within the num_components loop of the SMT is in the range<br>
of '96' to '127'. The MH_RTP_payload_type_descriptor() is used as a<br>
component_level_descriptor of the SMT. The MH_RTP_payload_type_descriptor<br>
translates (or matches) a dynamic RTP_payload_type field value into (or with) a<br>
MIME type. Accordingly, the receiving system (or receiver) may collect (or gather) the<br>
encoding format of the IP stream component, which is encapsulated in RTP. The fields<br>
included in the MH_RTP_payload_type_descriptor() will now be described in detail.<br>
[ 175] The descriptor_tag field corresponds to an 8-bit unsigned integer having the value<br>
TBD, which identifies the current descriptor as the<br>
MH_RTP_payload_type_descriptor(). The descriptorjength field also corresponds to<br>
an 8-bit unsigned integer, which indicates the length (in bytes) of the portion im-<br>
mediately following the descriptorjength field up to the end of the<br>
MH_RTP_payload_type_descriptor(). The RTP_payload_type field corresponds to a<br>
7-bit field, which identifies the encoding format of the IP stream component. Herein,<br>
the dynamic value of the RTP_payload_type field is in the range of '96' to ' 127'. The<br>
MME_type_length field specifies the length (in bytes) of the MIME_type field. The<br>
MIME_type field indicates the MIME type corresponding to the encoding format of<br>
the IP stream component, which is described by the<br>
MH_RTP_payload_type_descriptor().<br>
[176] FIG. 20 illustrates an exemplary bit stream syntax structure of an MH current event<br>
descriptor according to the present invention. The MH_current_event_descriptor()<br>
 <br>
shall be used as the virtual_channelJevel_descriptor() within the SMT. Herein, the<br>
MH_current_event_descriptor() provides basic information on the current event (e.g.,<br>
the start time, duration, and title of the current event, etc.), which is transmitted via the<br>
respective virtual channel. The fields included in the MH_current_event_descriptor()<br>
will now be described in detail.<br>
[177] The descriptor_tag field corresponds to an 8-bit unsigned integer having the value<br>
TBD, which identifies the current descriptor as the MH_current_event_descriptor().<br>
The descriptor_length field also corresponds to an 8-bit unsigned integer, which<br>
indicates the length (in bytes) of the portion immediately following the de-<br>
scrip tor_length field up to the end of the MH_cunent_event_descriptor(). The<br>
eurrent_event_start_time field corresponds to a 32-bit unsigned integer quantity. The<br>
current_event_start_time field represents the start time of the current event and, more<br>
specifically, as the number of GPS seconds since 00:00:00 UTC, January 6, 1980. The<br>
current_event_duration field corresponds to a 24-bit field. Herein, the<br>
current_event_duration field indicates the duration of the current event in hours,<br>
minutes, and seconds (wherein the format is in 6 digits, 4-bit BCD = 24 bits). The<br>
title_length field specifies the length (in bytes) of the title_text field. Herein, the value<br>
'0' indicates that there are no titles existing for the corresponding event. The title_text<br>
field indicates the title of the corresponding event in event title in the format of a<br>
multiple string structure as defined in ATSC A/65C [x].<br>
[178] FIG. 21 illustrates an exemplary bit stream syntax structure of an MH next event de-<br>
scriptor according to the present invention. The optional MH_next_event_descriptor()<br>
shall be used as the virtual_channel_level_descriptor() within the SMT. Herein, the<br>
MH_next_event_descriptor() provides basic information on the next event (e.g., the<br>
start time, duration, and title of the next event, etc.), which is transmitted via the re-<br>
spective virtual channel. The fields included in the MH_next_event_descriptor() will<br>
now be described in detail.<br>
[179] The descriptor_tag field corresponds to an 8-bit unsigned integer having the value<br>
TBD, which identifies the current descriptor as the MH_next_event_descriptor(). The<br>
descriptor_length field also corresponds to an 8-bit unsigned integer, which indicates<br>
the length (in bytes) of the portion immediately following the descriptor_length field<br>
up to the end of the MH_next_event_descriptor(), The next_event_start_time field cor-<br>
responds to a 32-bit unsigned integer quantity. The next_event_start_time field<br>
represents the start time of the next event and, more specifically, as the number of GPS<br>
seconds since 00:00:00 UTC, January 6, 1980. The next_event__duration field cor-<br>
responds to a 24-bit field. Herein, the next_event_duration field indicates the duration<br>
of the next event in hours, minutes, and seconds (wherein the format is in 6 digits, 4-bit<br>
BCD = 24 bits). The title_length field specifies the length (in bytes) of the title_text<br>
 <br>
field. Herein, the value '0' indicates that there are no titles existing for the corre-<br>
sponding event. The title_text field indicates the title of the corresponding event in<br>
event title in the format of a multiple string structure as defined in ATSC A/65C [x].<br>
[180] FIG. 22 illustrates an exemplary bit stream syntax structure of an MH system time<br>
descriptor according to the present invention. The MH_system_time_descriptor() shall<br>
be used as the ensemble_level_descriptor() within the SMT. Herein, the<br>
MH_system_time_descriptor() provides information on current time and date. The<br>
MH_system_time_descriptor() also provides information on the time zone in which the<br>
transmitting system (or transmitter) transmitting the corresponding broadcast stream is<br>
located, while taking into consideration the mobile/portable characterstics of the MH<br>
service data. The fields included in the MH_system_time_descriptor() will now be<br>
described in detail.<br>
[181] The descriptor_tag field corresponds to an 8-bit unsigned integer having the value<br>
TBD, which identifies the current descriptor as the MH__system_time_descriptor(). The<br>
descriptor_length field also corresponds to an 8-bit unsigned integer, which indicates<br>
the length (in bytes) of the portion immediately following the descriptor_length field<br>
up to the end of the MH_system_time_descriptor(). The system_time field corresponds<br>
to a 32-bit unsigned integer quantity. The system_time field represents the current<br>
system time and, more specifically, as the number of GPS seconds since 00:00:00<br>
UTC, January 6, 1980. The GPS_UTC_offset field corresponds to an 8-bit unsigned<br>
integer, which defines the current offset in whole seconds between GPS and UTC time<br>
standards. In order to convert GPS time to UTC time, the GPS_UTC_offset is<br>
subtracted from GPS time. Whenever the International Bureau of Weights and<br>
Measures decides that the current offset is too far in error, an additional leap second<br>
may be added (or subtracted). Accordingly, the GPS__UTC__offset field value will<br>
reflect the change.<br>
[182] The time_zone_offset_polarity field is a 1-bit field, which indicates whether the time<br>
of the time zone, in which the broadcast station is located, exceeds (or leads or is<br>
faster) or falls behind (or lags or is slower) than the UTC time. When the value of the<br>
time_zone_offset_poIarity field is equal to '0', this indicates that the time on the<br>
current time zone exceeds the UTC time. Therefore, the time_zone_offset_polarity<br>
field value is added to the UTC time value. Conversely, when the value of the<br>
time_zone_offset_polarity field is equal to ' 1', this indicates that the time on the<br>
current time zone falls behind the UTC time. Therefore, the time_zone_offset_polarity<br>
field value is subtracted from the UTC time value.<br>
[183] The time_zone_offset field is a 31-bit unsigned integer quantity. More specifically,<br>
the time_zone_offset field represents, in GPS seconds, the time offset of the time zone<br>
in which the broadcast station is located, when compared to the UTC time. The<br>
 <br>
daylight_savings field corresponds to a 16-bit field providing information on the<br>
Slimmer Time (i.e., the Daylight Savings Time). The time__zone field corresponds to a<br>
(5x8)-bit field indicating the time zone, in which the transmitting system (or<br>
transmitter) transmitting the corresponding broadcast stream is located.<br>
[184] FIG. 23 illustrates segmentation and encapsulation processes of a service map table<br>
(SMT) according to the present invention. According to the present invention, the SMT<br>
is encapsulated to UDP, while including a target IP address and a target UDP port<br>
number within the IP datagram. More specifically, the SMT is first segmented into a<br>
predetermined number of sections, then encapsulated to a UDP header, and finally en-<br>
capsulated to an IP header. In addition, the SMT section provides signaling in-<br>
formation on all virtual channel included in the MH ensemble including the corre-<br>
sponding SMT section. At least one SMT section describing the MH ensemble is<br>
included in each RS frame included in the corresponding MH ensemble. Finally, each<br>
SMT section is identified by an ensemble_id included in each section. According to the<br>
embodiment of the present invention, by informing the receiving system of the target<br>
IP address and target UDP port number, the corresponding data (i.e., target IP address<br>
and target UDP port number) may be parsed without having the receiving system to<br>
request for other additional information.<br>
[ 185] FIG. 24 illustrates a flow chart for accessing a virtual channel using FIC and SMT<br>
according to the present invention. More specifically, a physical channel is tuned<br>
(S501). And, when it is determined that an MH signal exists in the tuned physical<br>
channel (S502), the corresponding MH signal is demodulated (S503). Additionally,<br>
FIC segments are grouped from the demodulated MH signal in sub-frame units (S504<br>
and S505). According to the embodiment of the present invention, an FIC segment is<br>
inserted in a data group, so as to be transmitted. More specifically, the FIC segment<br>
corresponding to each data group described service information on the MH ensemble<br>
to which the corresponding data group belongs.<br>
[186] When the FIC segments are grouped in sub-frame units and, then, deinterleaved, all<br>
service information on the physical channel through which the corresponding FIC<br>
segment is transmitted may be acquired. Therefore, after the tuning process, the<br>
receiving system may acquire channel information on the corresponding physical<br>
channel during a sub-frame period. Once the FIC segments are grouped, in S504 and<br>
S505, a broadcast stream through which the corresponding FIC segment is being<br>
transmitted is identified (S506). For example, the broadcast stream may be identified<br>
by parsing the transport_stream_id field of the FIC body, which is configured by<br>
grouping the FIC segments. Furthermore, an ensemble identifier, a major channel<br>
number, a minor channel number, channel type information, and so on, are extracted<br>
from the FIC body (S507). And, by using the extracted ensemble information, only the<br>
 <br>
slots corresponding to the designated ensemble are acquired by using the time-slicing<br>
method, so as to configure an ensemble (S508).<br>
[187] Subsequently, the RS frame corresponding to the designated ensemble is decoded<br>
(S509), and an IP socket is opened for SMT reception (S510). According to the<br>
example given in the embodiment of the present invention, the SMT is encapsulated to<br>
UDP, while including a target IP address and a target UDP port number within the IP<br>
datagram. More specifically, the SMT is first segmented into a predetermined number<br>
of sections, then encapsulated to a UDP header, and finally encapsulated to an IP<br>
header. According to the embodiment of the present invention, by informing the<br>
receiving system of the target IP address and target UDP port number, the receiving<br>
system parses the SMT sections and the descriptors of each SMT section without re-<br>
questing for other additional information (S511).<br>
[188] The SMT section provides signaling information on all virtual channel included in<br>
the MH ensemble including the corresponding SMT section. At least one SMT section<br>
describing the MH ensemble is included in each RS frame included in the corre-<br>
sponding MH ensemble. Also, each SMT section is identified by an ensemble_id<br>
included in each section. Furthermore each SMT provides IP access information on<br>
each virtual channel subordinate to the corresponding MH ensemble including each<br>
SMT. Finally, the SMT provides IP stream component level information required for<br>
the servicing of the corresponding virtual channel. Therefore, by using the information<br>
parsed from the SMT, the IP stream component belonging to the virtual channel<br>
requested for reception may be accessed (S513). Accordingly, the service associated<br>
with the corresponding virtual channel is provided to the user (S514).<br>
[189]<br>
[190] Meanwhile, the present invention enables notification information to be transmitted/<br>
received as well as a mobile broadcast service.<br>
[191] According to one embodiment of the present invention, a notification channel for<br>
transmitting a notification message only is assigned as well as a channel for a mobile<br>
broadcast service and the notification message containing a notification content is<br>
transmitted and received via the notification channel.<br>
[ 192] According to one embodiment, the notification channel is available for transmission<br>
and reception of an emergency alert system (EAS) data.<br>
[193] According to another embodiment, the notification channel is available for an ESG<br>
update usage. For instance, in case of an ESG update due to an unexpected program<br>
schedule change or the like, a receiving system receives the corresponding ESG update<br>
information in a message format via a notification channel only and is then able to ef-<br>
ficiently operate an ESG update and management.<br>
[194] EAS data, ESG update information and the like in the notification message<br>
 <br>
transmitted on the notification channel are examples to help the understanding of the<br>
present invention. There exist more various and wider applications of the notification<br>
message types transmittable on the notification channel, v/hich further enhances em-<br>
bodiments of the present invention.<br>
[ 195] The present invention provides a presence or non-presence of a notification channel<br>
and location information of the corresponding notification channel via a fast in-<br>
formation channel (FIC), thereby enabling a receiving system to access the notification<br>
channel. In the present invention, FIC data describes ensemble information to which a<br>
notification channel within a corresponding physical channel belongs for example. The<br>
FIC data of the present invention can further include identification information in-<br>
dicating whether a corresponding notification channel has an emergency property.<br>
[196] A receiving system according to the present invention is able to collect and process<br>
information of a notification channel in a manner of parsing an access table<br>
(notification access table: NAT) received by being included in an RS frame. And, the<br>
receiving system according to the present invention is able to collect and process in-<br>
formation of each virtual channel in a manner of parsing SMT received by being<br>
included in an RS frame,<br>
[ 197] In the present invention, a virtual channel service, a mobile service or an MH service<br>
is used for the same meaning.<br>
[ 198] FIG. 25 is a diagram for an example of an operating method of a notification channel<br>
according to the present invention.<br>
[199] Referring to FIG. 25, if there is no notification message to be transmitted, a noti-<br>
fication channel in an MH system exists in an inactive mode. If a notification message<br>
such as EAS data, program schedule update information or the like occurs, the noti-<br>
fication channel enters an active mode. The corresponding notification message is sent<br>
via the corresponding notification channel.<br>
[200] FIG. 26 is a diagram of a syntax structure for FIC segment according to another em-<br>
bodiment of the present invention.<br>
[201] In the present invention, a single FIC segment is inserted in a single data group and is<br>
then transmitted for example. In this case, a receiving system receives a slot corre-<br>
sponding to each data group by a slicing scheme. In this case, corresponding FIC<br>
segments are interleaved by MH subframe unit to construct an FIC body. The FIC<br>
body, which is the collection of the FIC segments, provides channel numbers of virtual<br>
channels included in a whole physical channel for transmitting the corresponding FIC<br>
and an identifier of an ensemble to v/hich each of the virtual channels belongs, thereby<br>
playing a role in binding the virtual channels to the ensembles, respectively. In case of<br>
using the FIC, information of the FIC segment is basically transmitted once per MH<br>
subframe at least. Yet, its region is extensible in a manner that it is interleaved per MH<br>
 <br>
frame if a data size of FIC exceeds it. Moreover, if information of the FIC body<br>
amount to 37 bytes or more, it is transmitted in a manner of being divided by FTC<br>
segment unit to spread across all data groups within an MH subframe.<br>
[202] In particular, a maximum size of a single FIC segment unit amounts to 37 bytes and<br>
the FIC segment includes an FIC segment header and an FIC segment payload. For<br>
instance, each FIC segment can include a 4-byte FIC segment header and a 33-byte<br>
FIC segment payload.<br>
[203]	Meanwhile, according to one embodiment, if a size of a single FIC segment fails to<br>
amount to 37 bytes, a rest part of the corresponding FIC segment payload can be<br>
stuffed with stuffing data to achieve 37 bytes.<br>
[204] The above-explained respective byte values (FIC segment: 37 bytes, FIC segment<br>
header: 4 bytes, FIC segment payload: 33 bytes) are just exemplary, by which the<br>
present invention is non-limited.<br>
[205] The FIC segment header can include FIC_type field, ESGjversion field,<br>
Transport_Stream_ID field, FIC_seg_number field and FIC_last_seg_number field.<br>
The respective fields are described as follows.<br>
[206] First of all, the FIC_type field (2 bits) indicates a type of a corresponding FIC.<br>
[207] The ESG_version field (5 bits) indicates version information of ESG transmitted as<br>
EDC. For instance, version information of a service guide announcement channel of a<br>
corresponding ESG is represented in the ESG_version field, whereby a receiving<br>
system is able to know a presence or non-presence of an update of the ESG regardless<br>
of a presence or non-presence of EDC reception.<br>
[208] The Transportstream_ID field (16 bits) indicates an identifier of a globally unique<br>
broadcast stream that carries a corresponding FIC segment. Namely, the corresponding<br>
FIC segment provides identification of a broadcast stream carrying a corresponding<br>
FIC via the Transport_Stream_ID field.<br>
[209] The FIC_seg_number field (4 bits) indicates a number of a corresponding FIC<br>
segment when a single FIC body is carried by being divided into several FIC segments.<br>
[210] The FIC_last_seg_number field (4 bits) indicates a number of a last FIC segment of a<br>
corresponding FIC body.<br>
[211] The FIC segment payload can be constructed with an ensemble loop region (or a<br>
second region) and a channel loop region (or a third region). The ensemble loop region<br>
is repeated as many as the number of ensembles (NumEnsembles) described in a corre-<br>
sponding FIC segment. And, the channel loop region is repeated as many as the<br>
number of virtual channels (NumChannels) described in a corresponding ensemble.<br>
[212] The ensemble loop region can include Ensemble_id field, SI_Version field and Num-<br>
channels field.<br>
[213] The Ensemble_id field (8 bits) indicates an identifier of an ensemble carrying mobile<br>
 <br>
service explained in the following description. Namely, the Ensemble_id field plays a<br>
role in binding mobile services and an ensemble together.<br>
[214] The SI_Version field (4 bits) indicates version information of SI data of a corre-<br>
sponding ensemble transmitted within an RS frame.<br>
[215] The Numchannels field (8 bits) indicates the number of virtual channels that are<br>
transmitted via a corresponding ensemble.<br>
[216] The channel loop region can include Channel_type field, Emergency_Indicator field,<br>
Channel_Activity field, CA_Indicator field, Stand_alone_Service_Indicator field,<br>
major_channel_num field and minor_channel_num field.<br>
[217] The Channel_type field (3 bits) indicates a service type of a corresponding virtual<br>
channel. In particular, an FIC segment indicates an attribute of a corresponding virtual<br>
channel via the Channel_Type field. The value allocation and meaning of the<br>
Channel_Type field shall be explained in detail with reference to FIG. 27 later.<br>
[218] The Emergency_Indicator field (1 bit) indicates whether a service of a corresponding<br>
virtual channel includes an EAS message or whether a corresponding service has an<br>
emergency property.<br>
[219] The Channel_Activity field (2 bits) indicates a presence or non-presence of activity<br>
of a corresponding virtual channel. If a value of the Channel_Activity field is parsed, it<br>
is able to know whether a corresponding virtual channel currently provides a service.<br>
[220] The value allocation and meaning of the Channel_Activity field will be explained<br>
with reference to FIG. 28 later.<br>
[221 ] The CA_Indicator field (1 bit) indicates whether a conditional access (CA) is applied<br>
to a corresponding virtual channel. If CA is applied to a corresponding virtual channel,<br>
a value of the CA_indicator field is set to 1 for example.<br>
[222] The stand_alone_service_indicator field (1 bit) indicates a service of a corresponding<br>
virtual channel is a stand-alone service. If a corresponding virtual channel is a stand-<br>
alone service, a value of the stand_alone_service_indicator field is set to 1 for<br>
example.<br>
[223] The major__channel_num field (8 bits) indicates a major channel number of a corre-<br>
sponding virtual channel.<br>
[224] And, the minor_channel_num field (8 bits) indicates a minor channel number of a<br>
corresponding virtual channel.<br>
[225] If a data size of a corresponding FIC segment is smaller than 37 bytes, stuffing data<br>
may exist in the rest part of the corresponding FIC segment.<br>
[226] FIG. 27 shows one embodiment for the value allocation and meaning of the<br>
Channel_Type field included in the channel loop region.<br>
[227] Referring to FIG. 27, the channel_type field can indicate an audio/video channel, an<br>
audio/video and data channel, an audio dedicated channel, a data dedicated channel, a<br>
 <br>
file download channel, an ESG delivery channel, a notification channel or the like. For<br>
instance, if a value of the Channel_Type field is set to 110, it means that a corre-<br>
sponding virtual channel is a notification channel.<br>
[228] FIG. 28 is a diagram of one embodiment for the value allocation and meaning of the<br>
Channel_Activity field.<br>
[229] Referring to FIG. 28, if a value of the Channel_Activity field is set to 00, it indicates<br>
that a corresponding virtual channel is in an active mode and is providing a service.<br>
And, it also indicates that guide information for the virtual channel is currently<br>
provided via an ESG channel.<br>
[230] If a value of the Channel_Activity field is set to 01, it indicates that a corresponding<br>
virtual channel is in an inactive mode and does not provide a service. Yet, guide in-<br>
formation on the virtual channel can be provided through ESG. In this case, although a<br>
receiving system is unable to tune to the virtual channel, it may be able to provide<br>
guide information on the corresponding virtual channel.<br>
[231 ] If a value of the Channel_Activity field is set to 10, it indicates that a corresponding<br>
virtual channel is a hidden channel. In this case, the corresponding virtual channel is<br>
currently in an inactive mode and does not provide a service. And, guide information<br>
on the corresponding virtual channel is not provided. Hence, if a receiving system is<br>
not designated for a specific service on a hidden channel, the receiving system is<br>
neither able to tune to the virtual channel nor is able to provide a user with guide in-<br>
formation on the corresponding virtual channel.<br>
[232] If a value of the Channel_Activity field is set to 11, it indicates that a corresponding<br>
virtual channel is a software download channel. In this case, a receiving system is<br>
neither able to tune to a corresponding virtual channel for a general service con-<br>
sumption nor is able to provide a user with guide information on the corresponding<br>
virtual channel.<br>
[233] FIG. 29 is a flowchart for an operation of a notification channel for a notification<br>
message delivery in a transmitting side according to one embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
[234] Referring to FIG. 29, if such a notification event as EAS data or program schedule<br>
update information transmission and the like occurs, it is checked whether a noti-<br>
fication channel is in an active mode (S601). If the notification channel is in the active<br>
mode, TPC is updated in a manner of updating an FIC Version number within the TPC<br>
(S602). The updated TPC data is then repeatedly transmitted (S603). In this case, the<br>
FIC Version number indicates a version number of an FIC body that is an FIC<br>
transmission structure body earned on a corresponding physical channel. After a<br>
certain amount of time (i.e., two subframes), the updated FIC data is repeatedly<br>
transmitted (S604). Subsequently, after a certain amount of time (e.g., one MH frame),<br>
 <br>
the notification channel is activated (S605). A corresponding notification message is<br>
repeatedly transmitted on the activated notification channel (S606).<br>
[235] If the notification channel is in an inactive mode, FIC is updated in a manner of<br>
updating Channel_Activity field of a notification channel for transmitting a notification<br>
message within the FIC (S608). Namely, a value of the Channel_Activity field is set to<br>
a value (e.g., 00) for instructing channel activation. After TPC data has been updated in<br>
a manner of updating FIC Version number within the TPC (S609), the updated TPC<br>
data is repeatedly transmitted (S610). After a certain amount of time (i.e., two<br>
subframes), the updated FIC data is repeatedly transmitted (S611). Subsequently, after<br>
a certain amount of time (e.g., one MH frame), the notification channel is activated<br>
(S612). A corresponding notification message is repeatedly transmitted on the<br>
activated notification channel (S606).<br>
[236] While the notification message is repeatedly transmitted in the step S606, it is<br>
checked whether the notification event expired (S607).<br>
[237] If the step S607 determines that the notification event has expired, FIC is updated in<br>
a manner of updating the Channel_Activity field of the notification channel within the<br>
FIC (S613). Namely, a value of the Channel_Activity field is set to a value for in-<br>
structing channel deactivation (e.g., 01). After the TPC has been updated by updating<br>
FIC Version number within the TPC (S614), the updated TPC data is repeatedly<br>
transmitted (S615). After a certain amount of time (i.e., two subframes), the updated<br>
FIC data is repeatedly transmitted (S616). Subsequently, after a certain amount of time<br>
(e.g., one MH frame), the notification channel is deactivated (S617). A corresponding<br>
notification message is not transmitted until a next notification event occurs.<br>
[238] Thus, since the present invention is able to obtain a presence or non-presence of a no-<br>
tification channel, activation or deactivation of the notification channel, ensemble in-<br>
formation having the notification channel belong thereto, a notification channel<br>
number and the like through FIC (fast information channel), a receiving system is able<br>
to receive an ensemble including the notification channel by time slicing scheme in a<br>
manner of parsing the FIC.<br>
[239] According to one embodiment of the present invention, notification information<br>
including access information for receiving the notification message transmitted on the<br>
notification channel is transmitted in a manner of being described in a notification<br>
access table (NAT). Details of the NAT shall be explained with reference to FIG. 34<br>
later.<br>
[240] For example, the NAT is received by being included in an RS frame of an ensemble<br>
to which a corresponding notification channel belongs. In particular, a receiving<br>
system is able to collect and process information of the notification channel in a<br>
manner of parsing the NAT received by being included in an RS frame. And, the<br>
 <br>
receiving system is able to collect and process information of each virtual channel in a<br>
manner of parsing SMT received by being included in an RS frame.<br>
[241 ] The RS frame is a set of at least one or more data groups. IP streams of each service<br>
or ESG are included in a single RS frame and SMT section data may exist in very RS<br>
frame. If the RS frame is an RS frame that corresponds to an ensemble to which a noti-<br>
fication channel belongs, NAT section data exists in the RS frame. And, the RS frame<br>
may include a notification message. In particular, the notification message is can be<br>
received in a manner of being encapsulated according to an RTP protocol or a FLUTE<br>
protocol and being then included in the RS frame in an IP stream format having UDP/<br>
IP header attached thereto.<br>
[242] A length (i.e., the number of rows) of a column in a single RS frame is determined as<br>
187 bytes. A length of row amounts to N bytes. In this case, the 'N' may vary<br>
according to TPC data. The TPC data can include MH-Ensemble ID, MH-Subframe<br>
Number, TNoG (Total Number of MH-Groups), RS frame Continuity Counter, N<br>
(Column Size of RS-frame), FIC Version Number and the like. And, the N may vary<br>
according to a region within a data group to which the RS frame will be allocated. This<br>
is because error occurrence probability decreases in order of regions A &gt; B &gt; C&gt; D<br>
within the data group. In the present invention, the N is equal to or greater than 187 for<br>
example. In particular, a single RS frame has a byte size of N(row) 187(columns).<br>
[243] For clarity and convenience of description, each of the N-byte rows is named an MH<br>
transport packet (TP). The MH TP can include a 2-byte header and an (N-2)-byte MH<br>
payload. In this case, two bytes are allocated to an MH header region for example,<br>
which may be varied by a designer and by which the present invention is non-limited.<br>
[244] The MP payload can include a signaling information (SI) table such as SMT, NAT<br>
and the like as well as IP datagram. In particular, a single MH payload includes IP<br>
datagram only, includes an SI table only, or includes both of the IP datagram and the<br>
SI table.<br>
[245] FIG. 30 is a diagram of MH header and MH payload format of MH TP according to<br>
one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[246] Referring to FIG. 30, the MH header is able to include a type_indicator field, an<br>
error_indicator field, a stuff_indicator field and a pointer field.<br>
[247] Three bits can be allocated to the type_indicator field for example. And, the<br>
type_indicator field indicates a type of data allocated to an MH payload within a corre-<br>
sponding MH TP. In particular, the type_indicator field indicates whether data of the<br>
payload includes IP datagram or a signaling information (SI) table. In this case, each<br>
data type configures a single logical channel. On a logical channel for transmitting TP<br>
datagram, several mobile services can be transmitted by being multiplexed together.<br>
And, each of the mobile services undergoes demultiplexing in an IP layer.<br>
 <br>
[248] One bit can be allocated to the error_indicator field for example. The errorjndicator<br>
field indicates a presence or non-presence of error of a corresponding MH TP. For<br>
instance, if a value of the error_indicator field is set to 0, it means that error does not<br>
exist in the corresponding MH TP. If a value of the errorjndicator field is set to 1, it<br>
means that error exists in the corresponding MH TP.<br>
[249] One bit can be allocated to the stuffjndicator field for example. The stuffjndicator<br>
field indicates whether a stuffing byte exists in an MH payload of a corresponding MH<br>
TP. For instance, if a value of the stuffjndicator field is set to 0, it means that the<br>
stuffing byte does not exist in the corresponding MH TP. {f a value of the<br>
stuff_indicator field is set to 1, it means that the stuffing byte exists in the corre-<br>
sponding MH TP.<br>
[250] If the stuffjndicator value indicates that the stuffing byte does not exist in the MH<br>
payload of the corresponding MH TP (i.e., 0), the stuffing byte is not allocated to the<br>
MH payload of the corresponding MH TP but (N-2) IP datagram (or SI table) bytes are<br>
allocated to the MH payload of the corresponding MH TP. If the stuffjndicator value<br>
indicates that the stuffing byte exists in the MH payload of the corresponding MH TP<br>
(i.e., 1), k stuffing bytes and (N-2-k) IP datagram (or SI table) bytes are allocated to the<br>
MH payload of the corresponding MH TP. In this case, 0 
[251 ] Eleven bits can be allocated to the pointer field. And, the pointer field indicates<br>
position information from which new data (i.e., new SI table or new IP datagram)<br>
starts in a corresponding MH TP.<br>
[252] FIG. 31 is a diagram of one embodiment for the value allocation and meaning of<br>
type_indicator field included in the MH header shown in FIG. 30.<br>
[253] Referring to FIG. 31, if a value of the type_indicator field is set to 000, it indicates<br>
that an MH payload of a corresponding MH TP includes at least one or more IP<br>
datagrams. In this case, the pointer field value, as shown in (a) of FIG. 32, indicates a<br>
starting point of a first newly started IP datagram.<br>
[254] If a value of the type_indicator field is set to 001, it indicates that an MH payload of<br>
a corresponding MH TP includes at least one or more SI tables. In this case, the pointer<br>
field, as shown in (b) of FIG. 32, points the starting point of the first newly started SI<br>
Table.<br>
[255] If a value of the type_indicator field is set to 010, it indicates that an MH payload of<br>
a corresponding MH TP includes at least one or more IP datagrams and at least one or<br>
more SI tables. In this case, the pointer field points the starting point of the first newly<br>
started IP Datagram. In this case, stuffing data is not allowed.<br>
[256] And, the type_indicator field values 011-111 are reserved for future use.<br>
[257] The order, position and meaning of the field allocated to the MH header within the<br>
MH TP shown in FIG. 31 are just exemplary to help the understanding of the present<br>
 <br>
invention. As the order, positions and meanings of the fields allocated to the MH<br>
header within the MH TP and the number of additionally allocated fields are easily<br>
modified by those who skilled in the art, the present invention is not limited to the<br>
above embodiment.<br>
[258] FIG. 33 is a diagram for a syntax structure of SMT according to another embodiment<br>
of the present invention.<br>
[259] Referring to FIG. 33, an SMT is written in MPEG-2 private section format to help<br>
the understanding of the present invention. Since any format is available for the format<br>
of the SMT, the scope of the present invention is non-limited by this embodiment.<br>
[260] The SMT includes description information of each virtual channel within a single<br>
MH ensemble and other additional informations can be included in a descriptor region.<br>
The SMT is transmitted to a receiving system by a transmitting system by including at<br>
least one field. The SMT shown in FIG. 33 differs from the former SMT shown in<br>
FIG. 17 in contents included in access information of virtual channels and access in-<br>
formation of IP streams. For instance, the former SMT shown in FIG. 17 provides<br>
source IP access information if a source IP address of a corresponding virtual channel<br>
exists for a specific multicast source. Yet, the latter SMT shown in FIG. 33 does not<br>
provide the source IP access information. Moreover, although the former SMT shown<br>
in FIG. 17 provides a presence or non-presence of activation of a corresponding virtual<br>
channel, a service type and service identification information, the latter SMT shown in<br>
FIG. 33 does not provide them.<br>
[261 ] SMT section can be transmitted in a manner of being included as an SI table in an<br>
MH TP within an RS frame. In this case, the RS frame decoders 170 and 180 shown in<br>
FIG. 1 decode an inputted RS frame. The decoded RS frame is outputted to the corre-<br>
sponding RS frame handlers 211 and 212. Each of the RS frame handlers 211 and 212<br>
configures an MH TP by discriminating the inputted RS frame by a row unit and then<br>
outputs the MH TP to the MH TP handler 213.<br>
[262] In case of deciding that the corresponding MH TP includes an SI table based on a<br>
header of each of the inputted MH TPs, the MH TP handler 213 parses the included SI<br>
table and then outputs the result to the physical adaptation control signal handler 216.<br>
Yet, this case corresponds to such a case that an SI table is not encapsulated with IP<br>
datagram.<br>
[263] Meanwhile, if the SI table is encapsulated with IP datagram, in case of deciding that<br>
the corresponding MH TP includes the SI table based on the header of each of the<br>
inputted MH TPs, the MH TP handler 213 outputs it to the IP network stack 220. If so,<br>
the IP network stack 220 performs IP and UDP processing on the SI table and then<br>
outputs it to the SI handler 240. The SI handler 230 parses the inputted SI table and<br>
then stores the result in the storage unit 290 or outputs the result to the physical<br>
 <br>
adaptation control signal handler 216.<br>
[264] The physical adaptation control signal handler 216 checks an SMT via a table<br>
identifier of SI data outputted from the MH TP handler 213 or the SI handler 240 and<br>
then obtains a reception-specific virtual channel entry and IP access information using<br>
the checked SMT. This information can be stored in the storage unit 290. And, the IP<br>
network stack 220 accesses the corresponding IP stream only using this information.<br>
[265] Examples for the fields carried on the SMT are described as follows.<br>
[266] First of all, a table_id field (8 bits) is a field for identifying a table type, through<br>
which it is able to know this table is an SMT (table_id : An 8-bit unsigned integer<br>
number that indicates the type of table section being defined in Service Map Table<br>
(SMT)).<br>
[267] A section_syntax_indicator field (1 bit) is an indicator that defines a section format<br>
of SMT.<br>
[268] A private_indicator field (1 bit) indicates whether an SMT follows a private section<br>
or not.<br>
[269] A version_number field (5 bits) indicates a version number of an SMT.<br>
[270] A section_number field (8 bits) indicates a section number of a current SMT section.<br>
[271 ] A last_section_number field (8 bits) indicates a last section number of an SMT.<br>
[272] An ensemble_id field (8 bits) in the range 0x00 to 0x3F shall be the Ensemble ID as-<br>
sociated with this MH Ensemble. The value of this field shall be derived from the<br>
parade_id carried from the baseband processor of MH physical layer subsystem, by<br>
using the parade_id of the associated MH Parade for the least significant 7 bits, and<br>
using '0' for the most significant bit when the MH Ensemble is carried over the Primary<br>
RS frame, and using '1' for the most significant bit when the MH Ensemble is carried<br>
over the Secondary RS frame.<br>
[273] Next to the ensemble_id field, 'for loop', which is repeated as many as the number of<br>
virtual channels (NumChannels) within a corresponding SMT section, is located.<br>
Using the 'for loop', information on a plurality of virtual channels is provided.<br>
[274] A transport_stream_id field (16 bits) means a unique identifier of a broadcast stream<br>
carrying a corresponding SMT section. Namely, the transport_stream_id is a 16-bit<br>
unsigned integer number that identifies the broadcast transport stream that carries the<br>
service described below.<br>
[275]	A source_id field indicates the programming source associated with the virtual<br>
channel. In this context, a source is one specific source of video, text, data, or audio<br>
programming. And, source ID value zero is reserved. Source ID values in the range<br>
0x0001 to 0x0FFF shall be unique within the physical channel that carries the SMT,<br>
while values 0x1000 to 0xFFFF shall be unique at the regional level.<br>
[276] A major_channel_number field, which is an 8-bit unsigned integer field in the range<br>
 <br>
0x00 to 0xFF, shall represent the major channel number associated with this virtual<br>
channel.<br>
[277] A minor_channel_number field, which is an 8-bit unsigned integer field in the range<br>
0x00 to 0xFF, shall represent the minor channel number associated with this virtual<br>
channel.<br>
[278] An ESG_requirement_flag field (1 bit) is a one-bit indicator, which when set to '1'<br>
indicates that information carried within the ESG is required to access this virtual<br>
channel.<br>
[279] A number_stream field (6 bits) indicates the number of IP streams within this virtual<br>
channel.<br>
[280] An IP_version_flag is a one-bit indicator, which when set to T indicates that<br>
target_IP_address field is an IPv6 address, and when set to '0' indicates that<br>
target_IP_address field is an IPv4 address.<br>
[281] If the IP_version_flag field (1 bit) is set to '0', the target_IP_address field indicates a<br>
32-bit target IPv4 address for this virtual channel. If the IP_yersion_flag field is set to<br>
'1', the target_IP_address field indicates a 64-bit target IPv6 address for this virtual<br>
channel.<br>
[282] Next to the target_IP_address field, 'for loop', which is repeated as many as the<br>
number of IP streams (num_streams) within this virtual channel is located. Using the<br>
'for loop', information on a plurality of IP streams is provided.<br>
[283] A stream_type field (8 bits) indicates a type of a corresponding IP stream.<br>
[284] A target_port_num field (8 bits) indicates a UDP port number of a corresponding IP<br>
stream.<br>
[285] If a value of the stream_type field indicates an audio, an ISO_639_language_code<br>
field is further included. The ISO_639_language__code field indicates a language of an<br>
audio IP stream.<br>
[286] Moreover, the SMT can further include a descriptor providing additional information<br>
on a corresponding virtual channel and/or a descriptor providing additional information<br>
on a corresponding ensemble.<br>
[287] FIG. 34 is a diagram of a syntax structure of NAT according to one embodiment of<br>
the present invention.<br>
[288] Referring to FIG. 34, an NAT is written in MPEG-2 private section format to help<br>
the understanding of the present invention. Since any format is available for the format<br>
of the NAT, the scope of the present invention is non-limited by this embodiment.<br>
[289] The NAT is received by being included in an RS frame of an ensemble for which a<br>
notification channel exists. And, the NAT describes notification message information<br>
for enabling a notification message, which is transmitted on a corresponding noti-<br>
fication channel, to be received. In particular, the NAT provides access information for<br>
 <br>
enabling a notification channel to be acceded within a corresponding ensemble.<br>
[290] For example, the NAT can be transmitted in a manner of being encapsulated with<br>
UDP/IP by having a target IP address and a target UDP port number on IP datagram.<br>
In particular, the NAT is segmented into a predetermined number of sections, is en-<br>
capsulated with a UDP header, is encapsulated again with an IP header, and is then<br>
transmitted by being included in an MH TP within an RS frame. In this case, a target<br>
IP address and a target UDP port number the NAT section use well-known values,<br>
whereby a receiving system is able to receive the NAT section without separate IP<br>
access information.<br>
[291] For another example, the NAT section can be transmitted in a manner of being en-<br>
capsulated in an SI table format with an MH TP within an RS frame. In this case, the<br>
RS frame decoders 170 and 180 shown in FIG. 1 decode an inputted RS frame. The<br>
decoded RS frame is outputted to the corresponding RS frame handlers 211 and 212.<br>
Each of the RS frame handlers 211 and 212 configures an MH TP by discriminating<br>
the inputted RS frame by a row unit and then outputs the MH TP to the MH TP handler<br>
213.<br>
[292] In case of deciding that the corresponding MH TP includes an SI table based on a<br>
header of each of the inputted MH TPs, the MH TP handler 213 parses the included SI<br>
table and then outputs the result to the physical adaptation control signal handler 216.<br>
Yet, this case corresponds to such a case that an SI table is not encapsulated with IP<br>
datagram.<br>
[293] Meanwhile, if the SI table is encapsulated with IP datagram, in case of deciding that<br>
the corresponding MH TP includes the SI table based on the header of each of the<br>
inputted MH TPs, the MH TP handler 213 outputs it to the IP network stack 220. If so,<br>
the IP network stack 220 performs IP and UDP processing on the SI table and then<br>
outputs it to the SI handler 240. The SI handler 230 parses the inputted SI table and<br>
then stores the result in the storage unit 290 or outputs the result to the physical<br>
adaptation control signal handler 216.<br>
[294] The physical adaptation control signal handler 216 checks an NAT via a table<br>
identifier of SI data outputted from the MH TP handler 213 or the SI handler 240 and<br>
then obtains various kinds of informations (access information included) of a<br>
reception-specific notification channel using the checked NAT. This information can<br>
be stored in the storage unit 290. And, the IP network stack 220 accesses a notification<br>
message of the corresponding notification channel using this information.<br>
[295] Examples for the fields carried on the NAT are described as follows.<br>
[296] First of all, a table_id field (8 bits) is a field for identifying a table type, through<br>
which it is able to know this table is an NAT.<br>
[297] A section_syntax_indicator field (1 bit) is an indicator that defines a section format<br>
 <br>
of NAT.<br>
[298] A private_indicator field (1 bit) indicates whether an NAT follows a private section<br>
or not.<br>
[299] A version_number field (5 bits) indicates a version number of an NAT.<br>
[300] A section_number field (8 bits) indicates a section number of a current NAT section.<br>
[301 ] A last_section_number field (8 bits) indicates a last section number of an NAT.<br>
[302] An ensemble_id field (8 bits) in the range 0x00 to 0x3F shall be the Ensemble ID as-<br>
sociated with this MH Ensemble. The value of this field shall be derived from the<br>
parade_id carried from the baseband processor of MH physical layer subsystem, by<br>
using the parade_id of the associated MH Parade for the least significant 7 bits, and<br>
using '0' for the most significant bit when the MH Ensemble is carried over the Primary<br>
RS frame, and using '1' for the most significant bit when the MH Ensemble is carried<br>
over the Secondary RS frame.<br>
[303] A NumNotifSession field (8 bits) indicates the number of notification sessions<br>
described in the corresponding NAT section.<br>
[304] Next to the NumNotifSession field, 'for loop', which is repeated as many times as<br>
the number (NumNotifSession) of the notification sessions within a corresponding<br>
NAT section, is located. Using the 'for loop', information on a plurality of virtual<br>
channels is provided.<br>
[305] A transport_stream_id field (16 bits) means a unique identifier of a broadcast stream<br>
carrying a corresponding NAT section. Namely, the transport_stream_id is a 16-bit<br>
unsigned integer number that identifies the broadcast transport stream that carries the<br>
notification messages described below.<br>
[306] A source_id field (16 bits) identifies the programming source associated with the no-<br>
tification session. In this context, a source is one specific source of video, text, data, or<br>
audio programming. And, source ID value zero is reserved. Source ID values in the<br>
range 0x0001 to OxOFFF shall be unique within the physical channel that carries the<br>
NAT, while values 0x1000 to OxFFFF shall be unique at the regional level.<br>
[307] A Notification_Type field (7 bits) indicates a type of a corresponding notification<br>
session.<br>
[308] An emergency field is a one-bit indicator, which when set to '1' indicates that this<br>
Notification session carries Notification messages with emergency property.<br>
[309] A NumNotifMsg field (8 bits) is an 8-bit unsigned integer which represents the<br>
number of Notification Messages carried in this Notification Session.<br>
[310] An IP_version_flag field is a one-bit indicator, which when set to ' 1' indicates that<br>
target_IP_address field is an IPv6 address, and when set to '0' indicates that<br>
target_IP_address field is an IPv4 address.<br>
[311] If the IP_version_flag field (1 bit) is set to '0', the target_IP_address field indicates a<br>
 <br>
32-bit target IPv4 address for a corresponding notification session. If the<br>
IP_version_flag field is set to ' 1', the target_IP_address field indicates a 64-bit target<br>
IPv6 address for corresponding notification session.<br>
[312] Next to the target_IP_address field, 'for loop', which is repeated as many times as<br>
the number of notification messages (NumNotifMsg) within a corresponding noti-<br>
fication session, is located. Using the 'for loop', information on a plurality of noti-<br>
fication messages is provided.<br>
[313] NotifMsg_type field (8 bits) indicates a type of a corresponding notification message.<br>
[314] A target_port_num field (8 bits) indicates a UDP port number for obtaining a corre-<br>
sponding notification message.<br>
[315] If a value of the NotifMsg_type field indicates an audio, an ISO_639_language_code<br>
field is further included. The ISO_639_language_code field indicates a language of an<br>
audio notification message.<br>
[316] Moreover, the NAT can further include a descriptor providing additional information<br>
on a corresponding notification session and/or a descriptor providing additional in-<br>
formation on a corresponding ensemble.<br>
[317] FIG. 35 is a diagram of XML (extensible markup language) data structure for an<br>
example of a notification message (Notification_Message) according to the present<br>
invention. And, FIG. 36 is a diagram of the notification message<br>
(Notification_Message) shown in FIG. 3 in XML schema.<br>
[318] The notification message Notification_Message can include attributes and at least<br>
one Notification_Msg_Body element.<br>
[319] The notification message Notification_Message can include Notification_Msg_ID<br>
field, Notification_Msg_Version field, Emergency field, ValidFrom field, ValidTo<br>
field, Fragment_Number field and Last_Fragment_Number field, which are defined as<br>
the attributes.<br>
[320] The Notification_Msg_ID field indicates a value for identifying a corresponding no-<br>
tification message.<br>
[321] The Notification_Msg_Version field indicates a version of a corresponding noti-<br>
fication message.<br>
[322] The Emergency field indicates whether a corresponding notification message is the<br>
message having an emergency attribute.<br>
[323] The ValidFrom field indicates that a corresponding notification message is valid<br>
from a prescribed timing point.<br>
[324] The ValidTo field indicates that a corresponding notification message is valid to a<br>
prescribed timing point.<br>
[325] The Fragment_Number field indicates an order of a predetermined fragment if a cor-<br>
responding notification message is fragmented.<br>
 <br>
[326] And, the Last_Fragment_Number field indicates an order of a last fragment of a cor-<br>
responding notification message if the corresponding notification message is<br>
fragmented.<br>
[327] FIG. 37 is a flowchart for a method of accessing a notification message according to<br>
one embodiment of the present invention. In particular, a receiving system is able to<br>
access a notification message that is received on a notification channel in the course of<br>
providing a mobile service to a user.<br>
[328] Referring to FIG. 37, TPC is being monitored while a mobile service is provided<br>
(S701). If an FIC version number included in the TPC is updated (S702), a time slicing<br>
mode is exited after a certain amount of time (e.g., two subframes) (S703). An FIC<br>
body is then configured in a manner of gathering FIC segments within a single<br>
subframe and then performing de-interleaving on the gathered FIC segments (S704).<br>
By decoding every ensemble loop of the FIC body configured in the step S704, it is<br>
checked whether a notification channel is updated (S706). The update of the noti-<br>
fication channel can be confirmed by parsing one of Channel_Type field,<br>
Emergency_Indicator field, Channel_Activity field and the like.<br>
[329] If it is checked that the notification channel is not updated in the step S706, ap-<br>
propriate actions are performed (S707). If it is checked that the notification channel is<br>
updated in the step S706, it is checked whether a notification message transmitted on<br>
the updated notification channel has an emergency attribute (S708). For instance, when<br>
a value of the Channel_Type field indicates that a corresponding virtual channel is the<br>
notification channel, if the Emergency_Indicator field is parsed, it is able to decide<br>
whether the notification message transmitted on the corresponding notification channel<br>
has the emergency attribute. In particular, it is able to decide whether the notification<br>
message includes an EAS message.<br>
[330] If the step S708 checks that the corresponding notification message has the<br>
emergency attribute, the RS frame decoder and the RS frame handler are turned on<br>
after a certain amount of time (e.g., a next MH frame) (S709). For instance, if the RS<br>
frame of the ensemble, to which the notification channel belongs, is a secondary RS<br>
frame, the secondary RS frame decoder 180 and the secondary frame handler 212 are<br>
turned on.<br>
[331] Subsequently, by referring to an MH header of an MH TP of the RS frame processed<br>
by the turned-on RS frame decoder and the turned-on RS frame handler, an SI table<br>
(e.g., NAT) is parsed from the RS frame. Access information for receiving a noti-<br>
fication message (e.g., an EAS message) having an emergency attribute is obtained<br>
from the parsed SI data (S710). After the EAS message transmitted on the corre-<br>
sponding notification channel has been accessed using the access information, the<br>
accessed EAS message is processed (S711).<br>
 <br>
[332] If the step S708 checks that the corresponding notification message does not have the<br>
emergency attribute, the RS frame decoder and the RS frame handler are turned on<br>
after a certain amount of time (e.g., a next MH frame) (S712). For instance, if the RS<br>
frame of the ensemble, to which the notification channel belongs, is a secondary RS<br>
frame, the secondary RS frame decoder 180 and the secondary frame handler 212 are<br>
turned on.<br>
[333] Subsequently, by referring to an MH header of an MH TP of the RS frame processed<br>
by the turned-on RS frame decoder and the turned-on RS frame handler, an ST table<br>
(e.g., NAT) is parsed from the RS frame. Access information for receiving a noti-<br>
fication message (e.g., ESG schedule update information) having no emergency<br>
attribute is obtained from the parsed SI data (S713). After the notification message<br>
transmitted on the corresponding notification channel has been accessed using the<br>
access information, the accessed notification message is processed (S714).<br>
[334] In FIG. 37, for instance, the steps S701 and S704 are performed by the signaling<br>
decoder 190, the step S703 is performed by the operation controller 110, the steps<br>
S705, S706 and S708 are performed by the TPC handler 214 and the FIC handler 215,<br>
and the steps S709 to S714 are performed by the RS frame decoder and the RS frame<br>
handler.<br>
[335] FIG. 38 is a flowchart for a method of processing an accessed notification message<br>
according to one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[336] Referring to FIG. 38, if a notification message is accessed from a corresponding noti-<br>
fication channel, the notification message is configured by gathering notification<br>
fragments (S801). The notification message can include Notificauon_Msg_ID field,<br>
Notification_Msg_Version field, Emergency field, ValidFrom field, ValidTo field,<br>
Fragment_Number field and Last_Fragment_Number field, which are defined as at-<br>
tributes. If the Fragment_Number field and the Last_Fragment_Number field are<br>
parsed, it is able to configure a notification message by gathering at least one or more<br>
fragments.<br>
[337] If the notification message is configured in the step S801, it is checked whether the<br>
configured notification message is valid (S802). The validity or invalidity of the noti-<br>
fication message can be obtained by parsing the ValidFrom field and the ValidTo field.<br>
[338] If the step S802 checks that the notification message is valid, it is checked whether a<br>
version of the notification message is updated in a manner of parsing the Noti-<br>
fication_Msg_Version field (S803). If the step S803 checks that the version of the noti-<br>
fication message is not updated, it means the same notification message is already<br>
being processed. Hence, the accessed notification message is ignored (S804).<br>
[339] Meanwhile, if the step S803 checks that the version of the notification message was<br>
updated, a notification body element (Notification_Msg_Body) of the accessed noti-<br>
 <br>
ficalion message is processed (S805). If the step S802 checks that the notification<br>
message is invalid, the accessed notification message is ignored (S806).<br>
[340] FIG. 39 is a diagram for an XML data structure of Emergency_Alert element which<br>
is a notification message according to the present invention in case that the notification<br>
message transmitted on a notification channel has emergency attributes, and FIG. 40 is<br>
a diagram of the Emergency_Alert element represented in XML schema form.<br>
[341 ] First of all, the Emergency_Alert notification message, i.e., the Emergency_Alert<br>
element can include Notification_Msg_ID field, Notification_Msg_Version field,<br>
Emergency field, ValidFrom field, ValidTo field, Fragment__Number field and<br>
Last_Fragment_Number field, which are defined as attributes. For details of the re-<br>
spective fields, FIG. 35 can be referred to. And, the details are omitted in the following<br>
description.<br>
[342] The Emergency__Alert element can include lower elements such as EAS_ Nature<br>
element and EAS_Body element.<br>
[343] The EAS_Nature element can include EAS_originator_code field, EAS_event_code<br>
field, Alert_message_time_remaining field, Start_time field and Duration field, which<br>
are defined as attributes.<br>
[344] The EAS_originator_eode field indicates the entity for generating the emergency<br>
alert system (EAS).<br>
[345] The EAS_event_code field includes the information indicating the type of the EAS.<br>
For instance, it is able to indicate the importance of a specific emergency such as a<br>
large-scale earthquake, a medium-scale earthquake, a small-scale earthquake and the<br>
like together with a type of an emergency alert such as flood, earthquake, terror and the<br>
like.<br>
[346] The Alert_message__time_remaining field indicates the residual output time of the<br>
emergency alert message (EAM).<br>
[347] The Start_time field indicates the start time of the EAM event after 00 hours UTC,<br>
January 6, 1980 in second units.<br>
[348] The Duration field indicates the duration of the emergency alert event in minute<br>
units.<br>
[349] Meanwhile, the EAS_Body element can include Alert_Priority field, Force_Tune<br>
field and Force_Tune_Duration field, which are defined as attributes.<br>
[350] The Alert_Priority field indicates the syntax for displaying the priority or the im-<br>
portance of the emergency.<br>
[351 ] A prescribed processing of a received emergency alert message is determined<br>
according to a value of the Alert_Priority field. In particular, whether to ignore the<br>
received emergency alert message unconditionally or on a specific condition only or<br>
whether to perform a force tune to an emergency broadcast channel (exception<br>
 <br>
channel) included in the received emergency alert message is determined.<br>
[352] The Force_Tune field indicates that this EAS Message requires a receiving system to<br>
tune to the exception channel.<br>
[353] The Force_Tune_Duration field indicates a duration when a receiving system is<br>
forced to tune to an exception channel.<br>
[354] The EAS_Body element can include Alert_Text element, Location_Code element<br>
and Exception_Channel element, which are lower elements.<br>
[355] The Alert_Text element can include a content of a real emergency alert in a text<br>
format.<br>
[356] The Location_Code element can include Country_Code field, State_Code field,<br>
State_Subdivision_Code field and County_Code field, which are defined as attributes.<br>
[357] The Country_Code field indicates a code of a country associated with an emergency<br>
alert.<br>
[358] The State_Code field indicates a state or territory associated with an emergency alert.<br>
[359] The State_Subdivision_Code field may include 4-bit digits between 0-9 for defining<br>
a county subdivision.<br>
[360] The County_Code field indicates a specific county of the state associated with the<br>
emergency alert.<br>
[361 ] In the regional definition, regional titles according to the administrative district dis-<br>
crimination of U.S.A. are used, by which the scope of the present invention is non-<br>
limited.<br>
[362] The Exception_Channel element can include Target_IP_Address field,<br>
Carrier_Frequency field, Transport_Stream_ID field, Ensemble_lD field and<br>
Source_ID field, which are defined as attributes.<br>
[363] The Target_IP_Address field indicates a target IP address of an exception channel.<br>
[364] The Carrier_Frequency field indicates a carrier frequency of the exception channel.<br>
[365 ] The Ensemble_ID field indicates an identifier of an ensemble carrying the exception<br>
channel.<br>
[366] And, the Source_ID field indicates a virtual channel operating as an exception<br>
channel.<br>
[367] The Exception_Channel element can include an EAS_stream element as a lower<br>
element.<br>
[368] The EAS_stream element can include Stream_type field, Language field and<br>
Target_Port_Num field, which are defined as attributes.<br>
[369] The Stream_type field indicates a type of the EAS message stream.<br>
[370] The Language field indicates a language of the EAS message stream.<br>
[371] And, the Target_Port_Num field indicates a target UDP port number of the EAS<br>
message stream.<br>
 <br>
[372] Meanwhile, the previously determined broadcast schedule may be modified due to<br>
various reasons. For instance, a start time of a program to be next broadcasted may be<br>
delayed behind an original time due to an extension of a professional baseball game<br>
broadcast relay or the like. If a broadcasted professional baseball game ends ahead of a<br>
due time, a start time of a next broadcast program may come earlier than a scheduled<br>
time.<br>
[373] FTG. 41 is a diagram for an example that a determined broadcast schedule changes.<br>
[374] Referring to (a) of FIG. 41, it is scheduled that 'Superbowl' relay broadcast will be<br>
serviced on Channel 32-2 12:00 to 13:00. And, it is also scheduled that 'Prison Break'<br>
highlight is scheduled to be serviced on Channel 32-2 13:00 to 14:00. Referring to (b)<br>
of FTG. 41, it is observed that the schedule of the 'Superbowl' relay broadcast is<br>
changed into 12:00-14:00. And, it is also observed that the schedule of the 'Prison<br>
Break' highlight is changed into 14:00-15:00.<br>
[375] In this case, only if a receiving system knows the change content of the broadcast<br>
schedule, the receiving system is able to provide the correct guide information to a<br>
user.<br>
[376] As a method of announcing the broadcast schedule change to the receiving system,<br>
there is a method of transmitting ESG on EDC channel. If so, the receiving system is<br>
able to update previously stored ESG information by parsing the ESG.<br>
[377] FIG. 42 is an exemplary diagram for a structure of an electronic service guide (ESG)<br>
according to one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[378] Referring to FIG. 42, an ESG fragment associated with schedule change information<br>
is a schedule fragment. And, this fragment refers to a service fragment and a content<br>
fragment.<br>
[379] In particular, if entry point information of ESG is transmitted by being included in an<br>
ensemble, a receiving system receives a service guide delivery descriptor<br>
(ServiceGuideDeliveryDescriptor), which is information for describing ESG, using the<br>
corresponding entry point information. Information on the structure and acquisition of<br>
the ESG can be obtained from the service guide delivery descriptor. Using this in-<br>
formation, it is able to receive the ESG information.<br>
[380] The ESG is able to provide signaling information (or called 'announcement in-<br>
formation') by a subdivided lower unit. And, the subdivided lower unit is named a<br>
fragment. The fragments used for the ESG can include Service fragment, Schedule<br>
fragment, Content fragment, Purchase Item fragment, Purchase Data fragment,<br>
Purchase Channel fragment, Access fragment, session description fragment, pre-<br>
viewData fragment, interactiveData fragment and the like. Arrows shown in FIG. 42<br>
indicate reference relations. According to this example, the purchase item fragment,<br>
the content fragment, the schedule fragment and the access fragment can refer to the<br>
 <br>
service fragment. The schedule fragment associated with the schedule change in-<br>
formation can refer to the service fragment and the content fragment. The number ex-<br>
emplarily shown above each of the arrows indicates the available number of lower unit<br>
information. And, the numeral indicates the available number of fragments.<br>
[381] Major fragments among the exemplary fragments are explained as follows.<br>
[382]	First of all, the service fragment includes information on such a service provided to a<br>
user as a single conventional television channel.<br>
[383] The content fragment includes metadata for contents. For instance, A/V for contents,<br>
text, a type of an image and the like can be included in the content fragment.<br>
[384] The schedule fragment includes scheduling information on a single content. For<br>
instance, the scheduling information can include a broadcast time of the corresponding<br>
content.<br>
1385] The purchase item fragment includes item information associated with purchase.<br>
1386] The purchase data fragment includes information associated with a purchase of a<br>
service that can be purchased by a user.<br>
1387] The purchase channel fragment means an interface enabling a terminal or user to<br>
communicate with a purchase system. The purchase channel fragment includes in-<br>
formation on management of a parameter relevant to a purchase system or a purchase<br>
channel.<br>
[388] The access fragment includes information associated with an access to a service or<br>
content.<br>
[389] Yet, in case that ESG information needs to be updated due to an unexpected program<br>
schedule change or the like, a method of transmitting ESG data on EDC channel<br>
should send a massive volume of ESG data. Hence, it takes so long for a receiving<br>
system to update ESG information, whereby ESG update and management are not ef-<br>
ficiently performed.<br>
[390] In order for the present invention to operate the ESG update and management more<br>
efficiently, if ESG information needs to be updated due to an unexpected program<br>
schedule change or the like, the corresponding ESG update information is transmitted<br>
as a notification message on a notification channel.<br>
[391 ] FIG. 43 is a diagram of an XML data structure of Schedule_Update element that is a<br>
notification message transmitted on a notification channel according to the present<br>
invention by containing ESG update information, and FIG. 44 is a diagram for rep-<br>
resenting the Schedule_Update element shown in FIG. 43 in an XML schema form.<br>
[392] Attributes of the Schedule_Update message, i.e., the Schedule_Update element can<br>
include Notification_Msg_ID field, Notification_Msg_Version field, Emergency field,<br>
ValidFrom field, ValidTo field, Fragment_Number field and Last_Fragment_Number<br>
field. Details of the respective fields can use those explained in FIG. 35, thereby being<br>
 <br>
omitted in the following description.<br>
[393] The Schedule_Update field can include Reference element and Schedule_Info<br>
element as lower elements.<br>
[394] The Reference element can include Event_ID field, Service_Reference field,<br>
Source_ID field and Content_Reference field.<br>
[395] The Event_ID field indicates an identifier (ID) of a broadcast event the corre-<br>
sponding Schedule_Update element attempts to update. A schedule of a broadcast<br>
event having a corresponding Event_ID is updated by a corresponding<br>
Schedule_Update notification message.<br>
[396] The Service_Reference field indicates a reference for a virtual channel (MH service)<br>
on which a broadcast event to be updated by a corresponding Schedule_Update noti-<br>
fication message is being broadcasted.<br>
[397] The SourceJD field indicates a source_ID of a virtual channel (MH service) on<br>
which a broadcast event to be updated by a corresponding Schedule_Update noti-<br>
fication message is being broadcasted.<br>
[398] In case that a schedule fragment o a broadcast event that a corresponding<br>
Schedule_Update notification message attempts to update refers to a content fragment,<br>
the Content_Reference field indicates a corresponding reference.<br>
[399] The Schedule_Info element can include Update_Boundary element,<br>
Current_Start_Time element, Current_.End_Time element, Updated_Start_Time<br>
element and Updated_End_Time element.<br>
[400] The Update_Boundary element enables a receiving system to appropriately update a<br>
service guide in a manner of information the receiving system of a previous/following<br>
broadcast event that is affected when a corresponding Schedule_Update notification<br>
message changes a schedule of a single broadcast event.<br>
[401] For this, the Update_Boundary element can include Previous_Schedule element and<br>
Following_Schedule element as lower elements.<br>
[402] The Previous_Schedule element describes an event ahead of an event that a corre-<br>
sponding Schedule__Update notification message changes a schedule of the event or an<br>
event affected by a schedule change of a corresponding notification message.<br>
[403] The Following_Schedule element describes an event after an event that corre-<br>
sponding Schedule_Update notification message changes a schedule of the corre-<br>
sponding event or an event of which schedule is affected by a schedule change of a<br>
corresponding notification message.<br>
[404] For this, each of the Previous_Schedule element and the Following_Schedule<br>
element can include EventJD field, Service_Reference field, Source_ID field and<br>
Content _Reference field, which are defined as attributes. For details of the respective<br>
fields, the description for the respective fields described as the attributes of the<br>
 <br>
Reference element can be referred to. Hence, the corresponding details will be omitted<br>
in the following description.<br>
[405] The Current_Start_Time element among the lower elements of the Schedule_Info<br>
element indicates a current start time of a broadcast event a corresponding<br>
Schedule_Update notification message attempts to update.<br>
[406] The Current_End_Time field indicates a current end time of a broadcast event that<br>
corresponding Schedule_Update notification message attempts to update.<br>
[407] The Updated_Start_Time field indicates a start time after an update of a broadcast<br>
event that corresponding Schedule_Update notification message attempts to update.<br>
[408] The Updated_End_Time field indicates an end time after an update of a broadcast<br>
event that corresponding Schedule_Update notification message attempts to update.<br>
[409] FIG. 45 is a flowchart for a method of processing Schedule_Update notification<br>
message accessed according to one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[410] Referring to FIG. 45, if a Schedule_Update notification message is accessed from a<br>
corresponding notification channel, the Schedule_Update notification message is<br>
configured by gathering notification fragments (S901). The Schedule_Update noti-<br>
fication message can include Notification_Msg_ID field, Notification_Msg_Version<br>
field, Emergency field, ValidFrom field, ValidTo field, Fragment_Number field and<br>
Last_Fragment_Number field, which are defined as attributes. If the<br>
Fragment_Number field and the Last_Fragmenr_Number field are parsed, it is able to<br>
configure a Schedule_Update notification message by gathering at least one or more<br>
fragments.<br>
[411] If the Schedule_Update notification message is configured in the step S901, it is<br>
checked whether the configured Schedule__Update notification message is valid (S902).<br>
The validity or invalidity of the notification message can be obtained by parsing the<br>
ValidFrom field and the ValidTo field.<br>
[412] If the step S902 checks that the Schedule_Update notification message is valid, it is<br>
checked whether a version of the Schedule_Update notification message is updated in<br>
a manner of parsing the Notification_Msg_Version field (S903). If the step S903<br>
checks that the version of the notification message is not updated, it means the same<br>
Schedule_Update notification message is already being processed. Hence, the accessed<br>
Schedule_Update notification message is ignored (S904).<br>
[413] Meanwhile, if the step S903 checks that the version of the Schedule_Update noti-<br>
fication message was updated, an MH service affected by the accessed<br>
Schedule_Update notification message is identified (S905). The MH service is a<br>
broadcasting event that the accessed Schedule_Update notification message desires to<br>
update. The identification of the MH service can be obtained by parsing the Reference<br>
element of the accessed Schedule_Update notification message. The Reference<br>
 <br>
element can include Event_ID field, Service_Reference field, Source_ID field and<br>
Content_Reference field, which are defined as attributes. Optionally, the Reference<br>
element can further include Content_Reference field.<br>
[414] If the MH service is identified in the step S905, a schedule relevant service guide<br>
database is updated by parsing Schedule_Info element of the accessed<br>
Schedule_Update notification message (S906).<br>
[415] In particular, if the Current_Start _Time element, the Current_End_Time element, the<br>
Updated_Start_Time element and the Updated_End_Time element of the<br>
Schedule_Info element are parsed, it is able to know a current start time and end time<br>
and a start time and end time after an update of the identified MH service. If current<br>
time information and the time information after the update of the MH service are<br>
compared to each other, it is able to know schedule information of a previous and/or<br>
following event affected by the schedule change of the MH service. And, it is able to<br>
know an identifier (Event_ID) of the previous and/or following event affected by the<br>
schedule change of the MH service in a manner of parsing Previous_Schedule element<br>
and Following_Schedule element.<br>
[416] The schedule information of the above schedule-changed current event and the<br>
schedule information of the previous and/or following event affected by the schedule<br>
change of the current event are updated in the schedule relevant service guide database<br>
only. According to one embodiment of the present invention, in order to update the<br>
schedule information of the corresponding event only, a corresponding event identifier<br>
parsed from each element is referred to.<br>
[417] Meanwhile, if the step S902 checks that the Schedule_Update notification message is<br>
not valid, the accessed Schedule_Update notification message is ignored (S907).<br>
[418] According to another embodiment of the present invention, while a schedule relevant<br>
service guide database is being updated, schedule change contents can be automatically<br>
notified to a user. For instance, if a schedule of 'Superbowl' broadcast relay service is<br>
changed into 12:00~14:00 and a schedule of 'Prison Break Highlights' service is<br>
changed into 14:00~ 15:00, those program schedule changes are displayed on a portion<br>
of a screen by OSD (on screen display). Therefore, a user is automatically aware of the<br>
program schedule changes without selecting an ESG menu.<br>
[419] It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations<br>
can be made in the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the<br>
inventions. Thus, it is intended that the present invention covers the modifications and<br>
variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended<br>
claims and their equivalents.<br>
