				<td>The present invention relates to member for measurement of cell voltage and temperature in a battery pack.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a member for measurement of cell voltage and temperature in a battery pack, and, more particularly, to a member for measurement of cell voltage and temperature in a high-output, large-capacity battery pack having a plurality of unit cells, which are electrically connected with each other, the voltage and temperature measuring member being attached to electrode lead connection members that connect electrode leads of the unit cells with each other for simultaneously measuring voltage and temperature of the unit cells.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Recently, a secondary battery, which can be charged and discharged, has been widely used as an energy source for wireless mobile devices. Also, the secondary battery has attracted considerable attention as a power source for electric vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles, which haven been developed to solve problems, such as air pollution, caused by the existing gasoline and diesel vehicles using fossil fuel.<br>
Small-sized mobile devices use one or more unit cells, for example, three or four unit cells, for each device. To the contrary, medium- or large-sized devices, such as vehicles, use a battery pack comprising a plurality of unit cells electrically connected<br><br><br>
with each other because a high-output, large-capacity battery is required for the medium- or large-sized devices.<br>
Generally, a plurality of unit cells, which are connected in series or parallel with each other, are mounted in a cartridge, and a plurality of such cartridges are connected in parallel with each other, whereby a battery pack is manufactured.<br>
FIG. 1 is a perspective view illustrating an exemplary structure of a cartridge having four unit cells mounted therein.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, the cartridge 100 comprises a pair of frames 102 and 104, which are attached to each other The unit cells 200 are located in cell partitions 110 of the frames 102 and 104 while the frames 102 and 104 are separated from each other, and are then securely fixed at the cell partitions 110 of the frames 102 and 104 after the frames 102 and 104 are attached to each other. The unit cell 200 has an electrode lead, which is electrically connected to that of a neighboring unit cell 201 via a bus bar 120 located at the upper part of the cartridge 100. As shown in FIG 1, the unit cells 200 and 201 are connected in series with each other, although the unit cells may be connected in parallel with each other. The unit cells are electrically connected to a cathode terminal 130 and an anode terminal 140, which protrude at opposite sides of the upper end of the cartridge 10, respectively.<br>
A conventional method of measuring the voltage and the temperature of the unit cells 200 and 201 in a battery pack having two or more cartridges 200, which are electrically connected with each other while being stacked one on another, comprises the steps of: attaching an additional voltage measuring device to electrode lead connection members via wires to measure the cell voltage; and attaching thermocouples to the cell surfaces or in the vicinity of the cell surfaces and connecting the<br>
thermocouples to an external measuring device via a wire to measure the cell temperature. Consequently, external wiring members, such as the above-mentioned wires for the connection of the voltage and temperature measuring devices, are required for the battery pack, and as a result, the structure of the battery pack is more complicated. Complicated wiring makes it difficult to assemble the battery pack, and is a principal cause of trouble. Such complicated wiring may be simplified by the provision of a printed circuit board.<br>
An example of printed circuit- boards used in high-output, large-capacity battery packs is disclosed in Korean Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2002-39356 in which a printed circuit board is used as a connection member for the unit cells. The invention disclosed in this publication provides a method of directly connecting the printed circuit board, which includes an electric circuit necessary for connection in series or parallel of the unit cells mounted therein and a voltage measurement-purpose connection socket, to which a voltage measuring device is connected, to the unit cells.<br>
When the printed circuit board is directly used as the electrical connection member of the unit cells as described above, however, the entire battery pack may short-circuit even when the printed circuit board is partially damaged. Also, the connection of the printed circuit board and the unit cells reduced durability. Furthermore, the disclosed invention has the problem in that the measurement of cell temperature in the battery pack is performed through the additional external wire as described above.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a member for measurement of cell voltage and temperature in a battery pack that substantially obviates the above-<br>
mentioned problems of the conventional arts as well as the technical problems requested from the past. That is to say, it is an object of the present invention to provide a printed circuit board that is easily connected to electric connection members of unit cells in the battery pack for simultaneously measuring cell voltage and temperature without the provision of an additional wire.<br>

Consequently, the voltage and temperature measuring member according to the present invention has a structure in which the temperature measuring elements are attached to the printed circuit board, which is formed in a specific shape. The<br>
attachment of the voltage and temperature measuring member is easily accomplished by attaching the voltage and temperature measuring member to the electrode wire connection members such that temperature measuring elements are located on the unit cells of the battery pack. Consequently, the voltage and temperature measuring member according to the present invention does not require external wiring members, such as wires for voltage and temperature measurement, and, when the voltage and temperature measuring member is damaged, the damaged voltage and temperature measuring member is easily and conveniently replaced by a new one without the occurrence of a short circuit of the battery pack, and contact resistance, which may be generated due to direct connection between the voltage and temperature measuring member and the electrode leads, is reduced.<br>
Preferably, each of the temperature measuring elements (a) is a thermistor, the resistance of which is changed according to the temperature,<br>
The protrusions of the printed circuit board (b) may be fixed to the electrode lead connection members in various manners. Preferably, the protrusions are fixed to the electrode lead connection members by soldering. The temperature measuring elements (a) may be fixed to the printed circuit board (b) in. various manners. Preferably, each of the connection part of the printed circuit board (b) has through-holes, through which two connection feet of each of the temperature measuring elements (a) are inserted, and the connection feet of each of the temperature measuring elements are fixed to the printed circuit board by soldering while the connection feet of each of the temperature measuring elements (a) are inserted in the through-holes.<br>
