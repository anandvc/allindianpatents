				<td>The present invention relates a hexane bioactive fraction CIP 190 and obtained from the roots of an aromatic plant named Vetiveria zizaniodes commonly found in India for inhibiting the growth of drug resistant bacterial infections in humans and animals. The invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising the bioactive extract with other additives for inhibiting the growth of drug resistant bacterial infections in humans and animals. The present invention also provides a process for the isolation of said bioactive extract.<br>
Antibiotics have been used for long to cure bacterial, fungal and other infectious diseases of humans. Penicillin was the first antibiotic used against infections during the Second World War. Since then a number of antibiotics and their derivatives have been identified and used by man almost all of which were isolated from microbial sources. All the antibiotics in clinical use today can be grouped or classified according to their structure or functional groups. Streptomycin, icanarnycin, tetracycline some cf the well-known examples are aminoglycosides whereas penicillin and its derivatives are beta-lactam antibiotics. One of the commonly used antibacterials are quir.olor.es or   fluoroquinolones   such   as   nalidixic   acid,   ciprofloxacin.   norfloxacin   etc. Fluoroquinolones are now widely used to treat urinary tract infections, upper respiratory tract infections, and tuberculosis, which are resistant to first-line drugs. However, many of the pathogenic bacteria such as Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria Sp.,   Staphylococcus   aureus.   Escherichia   coii   are   developing   resistance   to fluoroquinolone class of antibiotics limiting their clinical usefulness. Since, the mechanism of action of all the quinolones against bacteria is similar, development of resistance to one of the quinolone antibiotic would confer simultaneous cross-resistance to almost all the other quinolones also. Fluoroquinolones act by inhibiting the function of a bacterial enzyme DNA gyrase essential for the maintenance cf supercoii nature of the bacterial chromosome. Resistance development is observed when a mutation in the DNA gyrase enzyme A subunit (GyrA+) specifically in the region called "Quinoione Determining Region (QDR)" occurs. The modified mutant form of A subunit (GyrA-) is incapable of binding to quinoione antibiotics and<br>
therefore is resistant. Such quinolone resistant infections are particularly difficult to cure. Kumar etal (Phytotherapy Research 14: 14-15. 2000: US Patent No.6, 127.405} have identified a semi-synthetic plant compound a -arteether which is capable of specifically killing quinolone drug resistant bacterial infections. The a-arteether was obtained by etherification of artemissinin a sesquiterpene lactone compound from a Chinese medicinal plant Artemisia annua. In our effort to isolate and identify more potent plant compounds which are active against quinolone resistant bacteria we carried out a systematic bioactivity guided fractionation of the ethanolic extract prepared from the roots of Indian medicinal plant Vetiveria zizanioides. The subject mentioned below specifically describes the manner in which the compound inhibiting quinolone resistant bacteria was isolated and identified.<br>

Another embodiment of the invention, in which the bioactive fraction obtained in step (m), is designated as C1M 109.<br>
Still another embodiment of the invention provides a bioactive fraction obtained from roots of Vetivera Zizanioides.<br>
Still another embodiment of the invention, the protic aqueous organic solvent used in step (b) theis selected from aqueous alcohol preferably aqueous ethanol. In our study specifically directed at finding an antibiotic or plant compound, which can specifically kill quinolone drug resistant bacterial infections, we found that the. ethanolic extract of roots of Vetiveria zizanioides was able to kill GyrA- mutant E.coli bacteria but not the wild type strains (GyrA+). The ethanolic extract was then fractionated by liquid-liquid chromatography and the hexane fraction was to found to possess the growth inhibitory activity. The hexane fraction was then fractionated using silica gel column chromatography wherein the fraction eiuted using 10% Chloroform in hexane indicated the desired bioactivity of eliminating Mycobacterhnn smegmatis (GyrA-) growth. Further to isolate and purify the active principle the eiuted 10% chloroform in hexane fraction was separated by column chromatography. The Chl:Hex (50:50) fraction obtained from this column was able kill the GyrA-strains of E.coli and M.smegmatis bacteria. The Chl:Hex (50:50) fraction was then purified by thin layer chromatography (TLC) to obtain a pure fraction called CIM 109 which has shown the desired bioactivty. Thus CIM 109 isolated from the roots of Vetiveria zizanioides was able to inhibit the growth of fluoro-quinolone resistant (GyrA-) bacteria. Hence, CIM 109 can be used for treating quinolone resistant bacterial infections of human and animals.<br>
The detailed description of the invention is explained in the form of examples and should not construed to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
Example-1<br>
The roots of Vetiveria zizanioides genotype KS-1 grown in CIMAP farm harvested during the month of April was dried in shade and ground to fine powder and then<br><br>
extracted by dipping the plant material overnight in different solvents. The solvent was then evaporated in vacuo and the residue termed as root extracts was redissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) at the required concentration and analysed for bioactivity.<br>
Example-2<br>
The ethanolic extracted prepared as above was tested for their growth inhibitory property against a number of bacterial strains by disc diffusion assay a procedure commonly followed and can be performed by persons skilled in the art. The results indicated that the eihanolic extracted residue showed a surprisingly interesting inhibitory activity against many bacterial strains. Hence, to explore the potential of using the extracts as anti-microbial agents the ethanolic extracted was then fractionated using different solvents as follows:<br>
ROOTS OF VETIVERIA<br>
EXTRACTED USING ETHANOL (95%)<br>
LYOPHILIZED POWDER DISSOLVED IN 2% citric acid in water<br>
LIQUID-LIQUID FRACTIONATION USING VARIOUS SOLVENTS<br>
1.	CHLOROFORM FRACTION<br>
2.	BUTANOL FRACTION<br>
3.	METHANOL FRACTION<br>
4.	ACETONE FRACTION<br>
5.	CITRIC ACID  FRACTION  IN  WATER AFTER NEUTRALISATION  WITH<br>
AMMONIA SOLUTION<br>
BIOACTIVITY TESTING OF ALL FRACTIONS<br>
POSITIVE FRACTION (METHANOL) FURTHER FRACTIONATED USING SOLVENTS LIKE HEXANE, ETHYL ACETATE AND CHLOROFORM.<br>
BIOACTIVITY TESTING OF ALL FRACTIONS<br>
HEXANE FRACTION WAS FOUND TO BE ACTIVE SILICA GEL COLUMN CHROMATOGRAPHY AS IN EXAMPLE-5<br>
Example-3<br>
The ethanolic extract of the roots of Vetiveria zizanioides was further fractionated by liquid - liquid chromatography using different solvents. The extracts were initially dissolved in citric acid containing water and the solvent extraction was performed with increasing degree of polarity. The solvent extracts obtained were then evaporated in vacuo and the residues were analysed for their anti-microbial activity by disc diffusion assays. The results as in table-1 indicate that the methanolic fraction exhibited maximum bioactivity against bacterial pathogens. We observed an interesting feature that the methanolic fraction does not inhibit the growth of wild type E.coli starin CA8000 but was inhibitory to the nalidixic acid resistant strains of E.coli DHSa, NK5819 and ET8000. These strains were resistant to nalidixic acid by virtue of carrying mutations in the gyrA. gene, which also confers resistance to other flouroquinolones (FQ) such as ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, levofloxacin etc. Hence \ye hypothesised that the methanolic extract might contain some active principle, which is able to specifically kill the FQ resistant bacteria but not the normal sensitive bacteria such as CA8000. Therefore to isolate the biologically active principle fraction, the applicants resorted to column chromatography of the methanolic fraction of the ethanolic root extract of Vetiveria zizanioides KS-1.<br>
Table-1: Bioactivity Response of different solvent fractions of the root extracts of Vetiveria zizanioides on different Bacterial Strains added @ 0.8mg/disc.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Example-4<br>
Further to test whether the active principle present in the methanolic can inhibit the growth of Mycobacterium sp. we fractionated the methanolic extract using three different solvents by liquid - liquid chromatography a commonly used technique which a person skilled in the an can perform The bioactivity testing again'st Mycobacterium smegmatis strain Mc2155 results showed that the hexane, chloroform and methanol fractions were inhibitory to the nalidixic acid resistant strains (NalR) (6b and 13a) of Mycobacterium smegmatis strain Mc2155 but not the wild type.<br>
Table-2: Bioactivity response (zone of growth inhibition) of liquid-liquid fractions of the methanolic extract of Vetiveria zizanioides KS-1 on M. smegmatis.<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Hence, it is clear from the above observation that the active principle not only inhibits the growth of FQ resistant E.coli strains as in example-3 but also inhibits the growth of the FQ resistant Mycobacterium smegmatis strain 6b and 13a specifically.<br>
ExampIe-5<br>
Further to purify the active principle silica gel column chromatography was performed. Any person who is skilled in the art of related subjects can perform the technique. About 20g of hexane fraction was packed onto a silica gel column and the fractions were eluted in hexane - chloroform solvent system. The table-3 below gives the number of column fractions collected using each solvent system. The column fractions were subsequently analysed for their inhibitory activity against M.smegmatis wild type and the mutants resistant to nalidixic acid. The results indicate that the column fractions eluted using 10% Hexane in chloroform was able to inhibit only the nalidixic acid resistant strains of M.smegmatis and not the wild type bacteria whereas the 15% and 25% Hexane in chloroform was able to inhibit both the wild type and Nal R mutant indicating that it is non specific. Moreover the 60% Hexane: Chloroform fraction was able to inhibit the NalR strains of E.coli but not the wild type. Therefore the 10-60% hexane in chloroform fraction can inhibit the fluoroquinolone resistant strains of both E.coli and M.smegmatis and therefore possess the ability to cure such drug resistant infections in humans and animals.<br><br>
