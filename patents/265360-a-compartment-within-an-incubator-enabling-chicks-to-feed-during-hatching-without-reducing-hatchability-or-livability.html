APPARATUS AND METHOD TOR FEEDING CHICKS DURING THE HATCHING PROCESS<br>
FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method and a compartment within an incubator, capable of allowing chicks to feed during the hatching process without reducing hatchability or livabilify. According to the prior art, most chicks which hatch from eggs in an incubator are prevented from immediately reaching their feed because of the structure of the incubator which prevents movement of the chicks and because the incubator is dark. The incubator is darkened because lighting with standard lighting means could heat the eggs that have yet to hatch and cause them to hatch prematurely. According to the prior art, there is no feed or light at ail in incubators, and chicks gain access to feed only when moved to farms.<br>
Immediate post hatch nutrition improves development during the chicks first days as well as through marketing in part by increasing breast muscle. The major source of energy in the developing embryo is the yolk. Yolk is utilized in two pathways. During the earlier stages of embryonic development, yolk transport is via endocyiosis directly into the circulation. Close to hatching, yolk is internalized into the abdominal cavity and is secreted through the yolk stalk into the small intestine. These two processes function close to and after hatch. Yolk that is transported through the yolk stalk enters the distal portion of the small intestine and is then pushed by anti-peristaltic movements up towards the proximal section of the Gastro Intestinal Tract (GIT) reaching the stomach where digestion begins. Yolk that goes directly into the distal portion of the small intestine is not hydrolyzed and is excreted. During this time the chick must transfer from yolk dependence to utilization of exogenous feed, intake of nutrients immediately past hatch stimulates transport of yolk through the yolk sialic into the intestine and intestinal growth. According to commercial practice chicks are fed only after 48-72 hours post hatch. Yolk, therefore,, provides energy for the developing embryo/chick, small intestinal growth, and if feed is introduced class to hatch then it stimulates yolk transport to the GIT and its utilization. During the initial post hatch period there is preferential growth of the small intestine as compared to other internal organs especially in chicks with immediate access to feed and water. Studies indicated that early availability of feed results in mors rapid intestinal development in the immediate post<br><br>
hatch period. The growth advantage in early fed birds after yolk assimilation is maintained through market age.<br>
In commercial practice eggs within a single tray will hatch over a 24-36 hour window during which time the birds which have piped are without feed, incubatory treatments and transport to the farm involve a further holding period. Thus, birds are held for 48-72 hours before initial access to feed and water. During this time chicks decrease in weight at an approximate rate of 4 grams per 24 hours due in part to moisture loss as well as yolk utilization. The process of incubation is 21 days, and at present broiler grow-out period is approximately 42-43 days, therefore each day of development plays a major role in final performance outcome. Providing feed within the incubator stimulates gastrointestinal development thus improving digestion and absorption of nutrients and decreasing die acclimation period from yolk dependence to exogenous feed. Caloric nutrients produce a considerable increase in body weight (BW) which was maximal between 4-8 days and then decreased. At marketing, birds with early access to nutrients were 5-8% heavier then held birds. Percentage of breast muscle was increased by 7-9% in fed birds.<br>
Chicks receiving immediate access to feed post hatch are not held for a prolonged period of time and thus have a welfare advantage to the majority of poultry which wait for up to 48 hours prior to initial feeding.<br>
There is thus a widely recognized need for, and it would be highly advantageous to have, apparatus and method for feeding chicks of various poultry, such as chickens, turkeys, geese, and ducks, during the hatching process, without changing their hatching times.<br>

Funnel 32 can be used in a similar manner with different section shapes, suitable for the position, shape, and dimensions of the relevant troughs.<br>
Trials were performed to test the efficiency of using side trough 100 according to the present invention using an external light source. Specialized trays were installed into the incubator on day 18 of incubation. This enabled early hatching chicks' immediate access to feed.<br><br>
The trial consisted of 4 treatments, which included fed and held birds as well as males and females. Prior to placement in experimental facility birds were individually weighed, 'fable I indicates body weight during trial.<br><br>
Results of this trial indicate a significant improved male body weight at. 36 days in fed birds (6%) as compared to held birds. Females receiving immediate post hatch feed improved body weight at 36 days by 2.8% as compared to control.<br>
Early feed has been shown in studies to improve immediate as well as further chicle/broiler development. These broilers achieved improved body weight and carcass development at marketing improvements such as these increase industry profitability substantially.<br>
Au additional trial examined the efficacy of using 4 sided feeder trough with external light sources. Similar to trial 1 specialized trays were installed into the incubator on day 18 of incubation. Tins enabled early hatching chicks' immediate access to feed.<br>
The trial consisted of 5 treatments, which included fed and held male birds with different external light sources. Prior to placement in experimental facility birds were individually weighed. Table 1 indicates body weight during trial.<br><br><br>
Data were analyzed using general linear model of JMP 5.01 (SAS Institute, Inc). Treatment means were compared by Tukey test, and significance was based on 0.05 probability level. Means in column with no letters in common differ (P 
Means in the table's columns with different letters in parentheses differ statistically, i.e. those results -with (a) within the same column are statistically different from those results with (ab) or (b) or (be) or (c). In this case, (a) gave the best results while (c) showed significantly poorer performance.<br>
Results of this trial indicate a significant improved body weight at 37 days in fed only I birds (5.8%) as compared to negative control birds. Broilers receiving immediate post hatch feed with an external white light source had an improved body weight at 37 days by 6.7% as compared to negative control.<br><br>
Our Trials demonstrated that using this specialized feeding and lighting trays within the incubator, according to the present invention, provides easy feed access to hatched chicks, while not decreasing hatehability and livability. Immediate feed stimulates intestinal development and improves initial body weight which persists through to marketing.<br>
A suitable light source according to the present invention would be any external non-heating light in a light spectrum that is visible to chicks,<br>
The light source can be placed in several locations within the incubator, such as on the trough, on the incubator carriage, or somewhere within the incubator as long as the fight attracts the chicks' attention.<br>
