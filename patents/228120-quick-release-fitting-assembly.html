				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001]    The invention relates to a quick-release fitting assembly, and more particularly to a<br>
water tight quick release fitting assembly for use in water treatment systems or apparatus.<br>
Description of Related Art<br>
[0002]    Water tanks and other pressure vessels are well known components of water<br>
treatment systems.   In a given system, the vessel is connected to other equipment by a fitting<br>
that provides fluid communication between the interior of the vessel and the remainder of the<br>
system. Typically, the fitting is a threaded fitting that is screwed onto or into a throat or<br>
opening of the vessel having complimentary threads.  In this manner, a well known screw-<br>
tight seal is achieved between the fitting and the vessel, with the fitting providing fluid<br>
communication between the vessel's interior and the remainder of the system; e.g. a valve or<br>
pipe on the other side of the fitting.<br>
[0003]    This type of fitting connection has at least two major drawbacks. First, a significant<br>
amount of work and specialized tools are required to install screw-type threaded fittings into<br>
pressure vessels to ensure water tightness. This presents a problem especially for installation<br>
of pressure vessels for, e.g., water softening systems, in cramped or tight spaces.  It is<br>
generally desirable to install new equipment (e.g. a new pressure vessel) in-place within a<br>
water treatment system, and to disturb the remainder of the system as little as possible.<br>
Unfortunately, often there is not enough space in residential (or industrial) water treatment<br>
applications to properly install a new or replacement pressure vessel in-place to an existing<br>
fitting. This is in part because the fitting, already a part of the system, must remain stationary<br>
and the vessel itself must be rotated to mate the fitting and achieve water tightness. This<br>
operation is extremely cumbersome and difficult in a cramped space, and can be impossible<br>
for certain vessels having non-circular cross-sections.<br>
[0004]     Second, for threaded fittings it is very difficult to predict the final rotational<br>
orientation between the fitting itself and the vessel to which it will be secured. In the case of<br>
metal-to-metal fittings, it is nearly impossible to design or predict the final rotational<br>
orientation that will achieve a water tight seal without over-tightening. This has presented a<br>
problem in the past because pressure vessels often have specific shapes to accommodate<br><br>
particular applications, and often these vessels must mate with piping or instrumentation in a<br>
fixed spatial relationship to the vessel itself. Therefore, it can be critically important that a<br>
fitting maintain a water tight seal with the vessel on the one hand, and provide properly<br>
oriented connections to mate with downstream piping or instrumentation on the other.<br>
[0005]     There is a need in the art for a water tight fitting suitable for water treatment<br>
systems that is capable of quick and easy installation without disturbing the remainder of the<br>
system. Preferably, such a fitting will provide a water tight seal, and still allows the tank or<br>
vessel to be oriented in any rotational position with respect to the remainder of the system.<br>
Most preferably, such a fitting will allow rotation of the vessel in-place without<br>
compromising the water tight seal.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006]    A fitting assembly is provided having a male fitting, a female fitting, a retaining<br>
ring and an O-ring. The male fitting has a cylindrical portion and a plurality of axially<br>
spaced, radially extending annular portions extending from the cylindrical portion. A first<br>
pair of the radially extending annular portions define a first retaining groove therebetween,<br>
and a second pair of the radially extending annular portions define a sealing groove<br>
therebetween. The first retaining groove is adapted to receive the retaining ring therein and<br>
the sealing groove is adapted to receive the O-ring therein. The female fitting has a throat<br>
that has a throat wall with a second retaining groove disposed in the throat wall. The second<br>
retaining groove divides the throat wall into an upper wall portion and a lower wall portion.<br>
The throat of the female fitting is adapted to receive and accommodate the male fitting<br>
therein such that a) the first retaining groove of the male fitting is aligned with the second<br>
retaining groove in the throat wall, b) the retaining ring is at least partially retained in each of<br>
the first and second retaining grooves, and c) the O-ring is radially compressed against the<br>
throat wall to provide a water tight seal.<br>
[0007]    A fitting assembly is also provided having a male fitting, a female fitting, a stiffly<br>
flexible rod and an O-ring. The male fitting has a cylindrical portion and a plurality of<br>
axially spaced, radially extending annular portions extending from the cylindrical portion. A<br>
first pair of the radially extending annular portions definine a first retaining groove<br>
therebetween, and a second pair of the radially extending annular portions define a sealing<br>
groove therebetween. The first retaining groove is adapted to receive the stiffly flexible rod<br>
therein and the sealing groove is adapted to receive the O-ring therein. The female fitting has<br><br>
a throat having a throat wall and a second retaining groove disposed in the throat wall. The<br>
throat wall has a retaining port therethrough that is tangentially aligned with the second<br>
retaining groove in the throat wall.<br>
[0008]    Another fitting assembly is also provided having a male fitting, a female fitting, a<br>
metal retaining ring and an O-ring. The male fitting has a cylindrical portion and a plurality<br>
of axially spaced, radially extending annular portions extending from the cylindrical portion.<br>
A first pair of the radially extending annular portions define a first retaining groove<br>
therebetween, and a second pair of the radially extending annular portions define a sealing<br>
groove therebetween. The first retaining groove is adapted to receive the retaining ring<br>
therein and the sealing groove is adapted to receive the O-ring therein. The female fitting has<br>
a metal rim portion and a throat having a throat wall. A portion of the throat wall is a metal<br>
surface provided by the metal rim portion, and a further portion of the throat wall is a plastic<br>
surface. A second retaining groove is disposed in the metal surface of the throat wall. The<br>
second retaining groove divides the throat wall into an upper wall portion and a lower wall<br>
portion.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0013]     Unless otherwise specified herein, all components and members of the invented<br>
fitting assembly are made via known or conventional means from conventional materials.<br>
[0014]    Figs. 1-3 show a quick-release fitting assembly 10. Referring first to Fig. 1, Fig. 1<br>
shows the fitting assembly 10 in an exploded view that has been exploded axially along the<br>
assembly's longitudinal axis 5. The fitting assembly 10 has a male fitting 12 and a female<br>
fitting 14. The male fitting 12 is preferably made from plastic, such as polypropylene,<br>
polyethylene or PVC, or any other suitable plastic or thermoplastic material, including<br>
polymeric and fiuoropolymeric materials. (Fluoropolymeric materials such as Teflon are less<br>
preferred for high pressure conditions because they are relatively soft and tend to flow under<br>
pressure. However, fluoropolymers can be used, e.g. for low pressure applications where<br>
chemical compatibility is of major concern). The fitting 12 can be made from metal, e.g.<br>
aluminum, copper, brass, steel, etc.<br>
[0015]     The male fitting 12 is a generally cylindrical fitting having a cylindrical portion 5<br>
and a plurality of axially spaced, radially extending annular portions such as first, second and<br>
third radially extending annular portions 6, 7 and 8 respectively extending from an outer<br>
circumferential surface 4 of the cylindrical portion 5.<br>
[0016]    The extending annular portions 6 and 7 define a first retaining groove 18<br>
therebetween. The first retaining groove 18 is adapted to receive a retaining ring 20 therein,<br>
and is deep enough to accommodate the retaining ring 20 in both a locked position and<br>
unlocked position as explained further below. As best seen in Fig. 1, the first extending<br>
annular portion 6 of the male fitting 12 has a gap 6a about the outer circumferential surface 4<br>
of the cylindrical portion 5. The gap 6a is to accommodate first and second overhang<br>
portions 41 and 42 of the retaining ring 20, as will be further described. Within groove 18,<br>
the interfaces or intersections between annular portions 6 and 7 and the outer circumferential<br>
surface 4 of the cylindrical portion 5 are square, meaning that annular portions 6 and 7 and<br>
the surface 4 meet at right angles. Such an arrangement provides a groove 18 having a<br>
generally rectangular cross-section. However, one or both intersections can be rounded,<br>
curved or chamfered.<br>
[0017]    The retaining ring 20 is a generally circular member having an inner diameter 46<br>
and an outer diameter 48. The ring 20 is discontinuous and has first and second overhang<br><br>
portions 41 and 42 with tabs 43 and 44 disposed at either terminus thereof. The retaining ring<br>
20 is advantageously made from a stiffly flexible material, such as a thermoplastic material.<br>
By stiffly flexible material, it is meant that the diameter of the retaining ring 20 can be<br>
expanded and contracted by the application of an external force, and will spontaneously<br>
return to its unflexed diameter once the external force is removed. By unflexed diameter, it is<br>
meant the diameter of the ring 20 when no external force is applied to expand or contract the<br>
retaining ring 20; i.e. the ring 20 is at rest. The retaining ring 20 can be expanded and   .<br>
contracted, for example, by opening and closing respectively the distance between the tabs 43<br>
and 44. It will be understood that at its unflexed diameter, the retaining ring 20 has a<br>
corresponding unflexed inner diameter and unflexed outer diameter, respective to inner and<br>
outer diameters 46 and 48. Stiffly flexible materials can include metals in addition to<br>
plastics.<br>
[0018]    A circular locking ledge 30 is provided within the first retaining groove 18 on the<br>
male fitting 12. The locking ledge 30 is disposed circumferentially about the cylindrical<br>
portion 5 within groove 18 adjacent the second extending annular portion 7. The locking<br>
ledge 30 is disposed at the intersection between the surface 4 and annular portion 7 as shown<br>
in Figs. 1-3.<br>
[0019]    The extending annular portions 7 and 8 define a sealing groove 16 therebetween.<br>
Within the groove 16, the interfaces or intersections between annular portions 7 and 8 and the<br>
surface 4 are similarly fashioned as described above with respect to groove 18. The sealing<br>
groove 16 is adapted to receive an O-ring 17 therein. The sealing groove 16 is deep enough<br>
to securely retain the O-ring 17, with a portion of the O-ring 17 extending radially outside the<br>
groove 16 as will be further described. The O-ring 17 is made from an elastomeric or rubber<br>
material. Suitable elastomeric materials include polytetrafluoroethylene elastomers including<br>
Teflon, Viton, Kalrez and Zalak elastomers (all registered trademarks of DuPont), neoprene<br>
rubbers, polyisoprenes, polybutadienes, polyisobutylenes, polyurethanes, EPDM, and natural<br>
rubber. Alternatively, any other suitable elastomeric or rubber material can be used for the<br>
O-ring 17, so long as the material selected is compatible with the wetting fluid; i.e. the fluid<br>
for which the fitting assembly 10 is used.<br>
[0020]    The female fitting 14 is made from the same or similar materials as the male fitting<br>
12. The female fitting 14 is also a generally cylindrical fitting, and has a throat 15 to<br>
accommodate the male fitting 12 therein. A circumferential lip 21 defines an opening 15a of<br><br>
the throat 15. The lip 21 preferably has a first chamfered edge 22. The throat 15 also has a<br>
throat wall 24, and a second retaining groove 19 disposed within the throat wall 24. The<br>
groove 19 separates an upper portion 24a from a lower portion 24b of the throat wall 24. The<br>
lower edge of the retaining groove 19 adjacent lower portion 24b is preferably a second<br>
chamfered edge 23. The second retaining groove 19 has a rectangular cross-section similar to<br>
the first retaining groove 18 described above. Also, the diameter of upper portion 24a is<br>
slightly larger than that of lower portion 24b. This is to allow easier translation of the O-ring<br>
17 past the upper portion 24a each time the male fitting 12 is inserted or removed from the<br>
female fitting 14 as below described.<br>
[0021]    The male fitting 12 is inserted into throat 15 of the female fitting 14 to establish a<br>
sealed fitting connection as will now be described. First the retaining ring 20 and O-ring 17<br>
are assembled onto the male fitting 12 as generally shown in Fig. 1. The retaining ring 20 is<br>
assembled to the male fitting 12 as follows. First, the tabs 43 and 44 are separated by known<br>
means (e.g. by applying pressure with one's fingers, or other mechanical device) to expand<br>
the retaining ring 20. The tabs 43 and 44 are separated until the inner diameter 46 of the<br>
retaining ring 20 is large enough to slide the ring 20 over the first extending annular portion 6<br>
from the top of the male fitting 12. When sliding the retaining ring 20 over the fitting 12, the<br>
tabs 43 and 44 are aligned with the gap 6a of annular portion 6 so that the overhang portions<br>
41 and 42 of the retaining ring 20 are disposed within the gap 6a once the retaining ring is<br>
seated within the first retaining groove 18. After the retaining ring 20 has cleared the first<br>
annular portion 6, the pressure applied to the tabs 43 and 44 is released, and the locking ring<br>
returns to its unfiexed diameter and is seated or retained within the first retaining groove 18.<br>
The unfiexed inner diameter 46 of the retaining ring 20 is larger than the diameter of the<br>
outer circumferential surface 4 of the cylindrical portion 5; i.e. at its unfiexed diameter the<br>
retaining ring 20 is retained loosely within the first retaining groove 18, such that by bringing<br>
the tabs 43 and 44 together the retaining ring 20 is compressed so as not to protrude from the<br>
groove 18, and is substantially completely contained therein. The O-ring 17 is then seated in<br>
the sealing groove 16. Once seated, the O-ring 17 partially protrudes or extends radially<br>
outside of the groove 16.<br>
[0022] The male fitting 12 (having the retaining ring 20 and O-ring 17) is inserted into the<br>
throat 15 of the female fitting 14 as follows. Pressure is applied to the tabs 43 and 44 so that<br>
the retaining ring 20 does not protrude outside of the first retaining groove 18. Next, the<br><br>
male fitting 12 is inserted into the throat 15 with the tabs 43 and 44 still compressed so as not<br>
to inhibit insertion of the male fitting. Once the first retaining groove 18 has cleared the<br>
opening 15a of throat 15, the pressure on the tabs 43 and 44 is released and the male fitting<br>
12 is pressed further into the throat 15. As the male fitting 12 is inserted further into the<br>
throat 15, the first retaining groove 18 is brought into alignment with the second retaining<br>
groove 19 in the female fitting 14.  Insertion proceeds until the retaining grooves 18 and 19<br>
are aligned, and the retaining ring 20 spontaneously expands into the second retaining groove<br>
19 to return to its unflexed diameter. At its unflexed diameter, the retaining ring 20 is<br>
partially positioned in each of the retaining grooves 18 and 19, thereby fixing the male fitting<br>
12 in place within the female fitting 14.<br>
[0023]    During insertion, the first and second chamfered edges 22 and 23 advantageously<br>
help minimize damage to the radially extending O-ring 17. The O-ring 17 is guided by the<br>
first chamfered edge 22, translating past the upper portion 24a of the throat wall, and is<br>
subsequently guided by the second chamfered edge 23 into position against the lower portion<br>
24b of the throat wall. The diameter of lower portion 24b, and the thickness and physical<br>
(compressional/elastic) properties of the O-ring 17 are selected so that the O-ring is radially<br>
compressed between the lower portion 24b and the surface 4 of the cylindrical portion 5 at<br>
the base of the retaining groove 16 to form a water tight seal, ft will be apparent from the<br>
above description and from the figures that once the male and female fittings are fixed in<br>
place, the water tight seal formed between the lower portion 24b, the O-ring 17 and the<br>
surface 4 at the base of the groove 16 is independent of the rotational orientation of the male<br>
and female fittings 12 and 14. In other words, the male fitting 12 can be rotated within the<br>
female fitting 14 without breaking or substantially compromising the water tight seal.<br>
[0024]    Referring to Fig. 2, the fitting assembly 10 is shown with the male fitting 12 fixed in<br>
place within the female fitting 14. As seen in Fig. 2, the resting inner diameter 46 of the<br>
retaining ring 20 is large enough to accommodate the locking ledge 30 therein. When the<br>
fitting is not pressurized from a working fluid, the locking ring 20 can be compressed into the<br>
first retaining groove 18 above the locking ledge 30 and the male fitting 12 can be removed.<br>
This is referred to as the unlocked position because the locking ring 20 is free to be<br>
compressed into the first retaining groove 18 (so it no longer extends into the second<br>
retaining groove 19) to permit removal of the male fitting 12 from the female fitting 14.<br>
However, when the fitting is pressurized from the working fluid, the male fitting 12 is<br><br>
pressed upward as a result of internal pressure and the locking ledge 30 becomes seated<br>
within the inner diameter 46 of the retaining ring 20. (See Fig. 3). In this position, referred<br>
to as the locked position, the locking ledge 30 prevents the retaining ring 20 from being<br>
compressed and the male fitting is locked into the female fitting; i.e. the male fitting 12<br>
cannot be removed. Thus, the locking ledge 30 provides a safeguard against accidental<br>
compression of the retaining ring 20 when the fitting is pressurized. Also, the locking ledge<br>
30 prevents an operator who is not aware the fitting is pressurized from removing the male<br>
fitting 12, thereby greatly reducing the risk of injury and equipment damage.<br>
[0025]    Figs. 4 and 5 show a fitting assembly 110 according to a second embodiment of the<br>
invention.  In Figs. 4 and 5, members or elements corresponding to analogous members or<br>
elements from the first embodiment of Figs. 1-3 are indicated by like reference numerals<br>
plus 100, (e.g. the male fitting 12 functionally corresponds to male fitting 112). Referring to<br>
Fig. 5, a female fitting 114 is shown molded into or as part of a water tank or vessel 100 to<br>
form an integral part thereof. This is one embodiment. In another embodiment, the female<br>
fitting 114 can be a stand-alone fitting adapted to mate to a stand-alone vessel or other piping<br>
or equipment known in the art, e.g. via a threaded connection or other conventional<br>
connection. Likewise, the male fitting 112, as well as the male and female fittings 12 and 14<br>
from Figs. 1-3, can be a stand-alone fitting as shown, or alternatively it can be molded into,<br>
or as part of, a vessel, pipe or other equipment known in the art to form an integral part<br>
thereof. It will be understood that when stand-alone fittings are used, these fittings can have<br>
threaded connections for being permanently connected to fixtures such as tanks, vessels,<br>
pipes, and other operational units (which are units or machines that perform some function in<br>
a water or fluid system, including distillation columns, absorbers, adsorbers, scrubbers,<br>
reactors, heat exchangers, flowmeters, valves, digesters, ovens, etc.).<br>
[0026]    Returning to the figures, Figs. 4 and 5 show the fitting assembly 110 with the male<br>
fitting 112 fixed into a throat 115 of the female fitting 114 to form a water tight sealed<br>
connection.   A sealing groove 116, an O-ring 117 and a throat wall 124 are all provided<br>
substantially similarly as in the first embodiment described above. A first retaining groove<br>
118 and a second retaining groove 119 are also similarly provided in the male and female<br>
fittings 112 and 114 respectively. In addition to the second retaining groove 119, the female<br>
fitting 114 is also provided with a retaining port 105 through the throat wall 124. The port<br>
105 is tangential to the groove 119. To provide a sealed fitting connection in this<br><br>
embodiment, the O-ring 117 is seated in the sealing groove 116 and the male fitting is<br>
inserted into the throat 124 of the female fitting 114. A stiffly flexible retaining rod 120 is<br>
then inserted into the port 105 which is now tangentially aligned with the retaining passage<br>
formed by the opposing first and second retaining grooves 118 and 119 as seen in Fig. 5.<br>
Once in place, the retaining rod 120 prevents removal of the male fitting 112 because it is<br>
partially retained in both the first and second retaining grooves 118 and 119 as is shown in<br>
Fig. 5. Similarly as in the first embodiment, the O-ring 117 is compressed between the-<br>
throat wall 124 and the base of the retaining groove 116 to form a water tight seal, and the<br>
retaining rod 120 fixes the male and female fittings 112 and 114 in place. The male fitting<br>
112 can be rotated relative to the female fitting 114 without breaking or substantially<br>
compromising the water tight seal formed between the O-ring 117 and the throat wall 124.<br>
[0027]    Fig. 6 shows a fitting assembly 210 according to a third embodiment of the<br>
invention. This embodiment is preferred where ASME standards require pressurized fittings<br>
(for pressure vessels) to be fixed in place by metal components. In Fig. 6, members or<br>
elements corresponding to analogous members or elements from the first embodiment of<br>
Figs. 1-3 are indicated by like reference numerals plus 200, (e.g. male fitting 12 functionally<br>
corresponds to male fitting 212). As seen in the figure, this embodiment is substantially<br>
similar to the first embodiment of Figs. 1-3, except that a metal rim portion 250 has been<br>
provided to contain the second retaining groove 219. The metal rim portion 250 is preferably<br>
provided as an integral part of a vessel 200 by a known or conventional method . In one<br>
method, the metal rim portion 250 is first cast by a conventional casting method, and then<br>
placed as an insert in a blow mold or rotational mold. Then the vessel is blow molded or<br>
rotationally molded around the metal rim portion 250, such that the metal rim portion 250<br>
becomes an integral part of the finished molded vessel 200. Methods of blow molding and<br>
rotationally molding are conventional in the art.<br>
[0028]    The metal rim portion 250 is cast or formed with a trapezoidal groove 252, or some<br>
other retentive shape. By retentive shape, it is meant that the groove has a cross-section<br>
which, because of its geometry, is effective to physically retain plastic material from the<br>
vessel 200 that is pressed therein during the molding process and then cured or set. Also, the<br>
outer wall of the vessel 200 is molded around and over an outer circumferential rim 251 of<br>
the metal rim portion 250 thus providing a slot 202 in the shoulder of the vessel 200 to retain<br>
the rim 251.  In this manner, the metal rim portion 250 is securely and permanently<br><br>
constrained in place as an integral part of the vessel 200. Subsequently, the vessel can be<br>
resin coated and/or filament wound as known in the art.<br>
[0029]     In this embodiment a throat wall 224 that forms the sealing surface for the O-ring<br>
217 is a plastic surface; i.e. the metal rim portion 250 is lined with plastic about its inner<br>
diameter as shown in Fig. 6. Also, in this embodiment the male fitting 212 and retaining ring<br>
220 are made from metal. In this manner, all wetted surfaces are made from plastic and all<br>
elements for fixing the male and female fittings in place arc made from metal in accord with<br>
ASME standards. The fitting assembly 210 of this embodiment is otherwise made and used<br>
substantially similarly as described above with respect to the first embodiment shown in<br>
Figs. 1-3.<br>
[0030]    From the foregoing, it will be apparent that a quick release fitting assembly can be<br>
quickly connected and disconnected without the use of specialized tools. Such a fitting<br>
assembly is especially useful for making separable, but still water tight connections in<br>
confined spaces where conventional threaded fittings would be difficult to connect or<br>
disconnect.   In addition, a quick release fitting assembly allows the male and female fittings<br>
(and therefore equipment to which they are respectively attached) to be rotationally oriented<br>
in any position along a full 360° arc relative to one another while still maintaining a water<br>
tight seal. In other words, the water tight seal remains substantially intact and is independent<br>
of the relative rotational orientation between the male fitting 12,112,212 and the female<br>
fitting 14,114,214.  In one embodiment, the fitting assembly is designed to prevent accidental<br>
or unwitting disconnection of the fitting assembly while pressurized. This reduces the risk of<br>
operator injury as well as equipment damage or failure. The fitting assembly has the further<br>
advantage that it can be repeatedly reused, (i.e. the male and female fittings connected and<br>
disconnected) without substantially compromising the water tight integrity of the system.<br>
This is because the O-ring 17,117,217 of the fitting assembly can be quickly and easily<br>
replaced in-situ without removing the fittings and without substantially impacting the<br>
remainder of the system. Conversely, once threaded sealing connections in conventional<br>
threaded fittings are worn or stripped, they must be replaced. Replacement of conventional<br>
fittings is time consuming and expensive, and can contribute to significant down time.<br>
[0031 ]    The fitting assembly has been described assuming liquid water to be the working<br>
fluid. However, the fitting assembly can also be used with other working fluids, such as<br>
acids, bases, organic and inorganic chemicals, etc., in liquid, gaseous, or saturated states.  In<br><br>
this event, it will be understood that certain modifications may be desirable to accommodate<br>
alternative working fluids. Such modifications are well known or conventional in the art; e.g.<br>
the materials of construction can be adapted for compatibility with the working fluid. It will<br>
be understood that the term "water tight" as used herein includes fluid- or gas-tightness for<br>
other fluids or gases should another fluid or gas be the working fluid instead of liquid water.<br>
[0032]    Although the hereinabove described embodiments of the invention constitute the<br>
embodiments, it should be understood that modifications can be made thereto without<br>
departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims.<br><br>
