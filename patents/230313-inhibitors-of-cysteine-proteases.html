Working up the reaction mixtures and purification of the compounds thus obtained may be carried out in accordance to known procedures or according to the Examples.<br>
Above and elsewhere in the present description the following terms have the following<br>
meanings.<br>
Halo or halogen denote I, Br, CI or F.<br>
The term "lower" referred to above and hereinafter in connection with organic radicals or compounds respectively defines such as branched or unbranched with up to and including 6 carbon atoms.<br>
A "lower alkyl" group is branched or unbranched and contains 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Lower alkyl represents, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, isopropyl isobutyl, tertiary butyl or neopentyl (2,2-dimethylpropyl).<br>
"Halo-substituted lower alkyl" is C1-C7 lower alkyl substituted by up to 6 halo atoms, preferably mono, di or tri-substituted lower alkyl.<br><br>
A "lower alkoxy" group is branched or unbranched and contains 1 to 6 carbon atoms, preferably 1-4 carbon atoms. Lower alkoxy represents for example methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, butoxy, isopropoxy, isobutoxy or tertiary butoxy.<br>
"Aryl" represents a phenyl or naphthyl radical. Preferably a "carbocyclic aryl" consisting solely of carbon and hydrogen atoms optionally substituted, mono-, di- or tri-substituted by one, two or three radicals selected from lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, hydroxy, halogen, Preferred as carbocyclic aryl is phenyl or phenyl optionally substituted, for instance, as described in the examples, e.g. mono-, di- or tri-substituted by halogen, lower alkyl, lower or alkoxy.<br>
"Cycloalkyl" represents a saturated cyclic hydrocarbon optionally substituted by lower alkyl which contains 3 to 10 ring carbons and is advantageously cyclopropyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl or optionally substituted by lower alkyl.<br>
"N-heterocyclyl" represents a saturated, partially unsaturated or aromatic nitrogen containing heterocyclic moiety attached via a nitrogen atom having from 3 to 8 ring atoms, optionally containing a further O heteroatom optionally substituted by a lower alkyl or lower alkyl carbonyl.<br>
"Lower alkyl carbonyl" refers to a radical of the formula -C(0)Ra where Ra is a lower alkyl radical defined above, for example, acetyl, ethylcarbonyl, or n-propylcarbonyl.<br>
Compounds of the invention are either obtained in the free form, or as a salt thereof if salt forming groups are present. Compounds of the invention having basic groups can be converted into acid addition salts, especially pharmaceutically acceptable salts. These are formed, for example, with inorganic acids, such as mineral acids, for example sulfuric acid, a phosphoric or hydrohalic acid, or with organic carboxylic acids, such as (C1-C4) alkanecarboxylic acids which, for example, are unsubstituted or substituted by halogen, for example acetic acid, such as saturated or unsaturated dicarboxylic acids, for example oxalic, succinic, maleic or fumaric acid, such as hydroxycarboxylic acids, for example glycolic, lactic, malic, tartaric or citric acid, such as amino acids, for example aspartic or glutamic acid, or with organic sulfonic acids, such as (Cl-C4)-alkylsulfonic acids (for example methanesulfonic acid) or arylsulfonic acids which are unsubstituted or substituted (for example by halogen). Preferred are salts formed with hydrochloric acid, methanesulfonic acid and maleic acid.<br><br>
In view of the close relationship between the free compounds and the compounds in the form of their salts, whenever a compound is referred to in this context, a corresponding salt is also intended, provided such is possible or appropriate under the circumstances.<br>
The compounds, including their salts, can also be obtained in the form of their hydrates, or include other solvents used for their crystallization.<br>
If one or more other functional groups, for example carboxy, hydroxy, amino, or mercapto, are or need to be protected in a compound of formulae I, because they should not take part in the reaction, these are such groups as are usually used in the synthesis of peptide compounds, and also of cephalosporins and penicillins, as well as nucleic acid derivatives and sugars.<br>
The protecting groups may already be present in precursors and should protect the functional groups concerned against unwanted secondary reactions, such as acylations, etherifications, esterifications, oxidations, solvolysis, and similar reactions. It is a characteristic of protecting groups that they lend themselves readily, i.e. without undesired secondary reactions, to removal, typically by solvolysis, reduction, photolysis or also by enzyme activity, for example under conditions analogous to physiological conditions, and that they are not present in the end-products. The specialist knows, or can easily establish, which protecting groups are suitable with the reactions mentioned hereinabove and hereinafter.<br>
The starting compounds of formula II and formula III may be produced as described in the Examples.<br>
The compounds of the invention exhibit valuable pharmacological properties in mammals and are therefore useful as pharmaceuticals. They are particularly useful as inhibitors of cathepsin K or cathepsin S or both.<br>
The cathepsin K inhibitory effects of the compound of the invention can be demonstrated in vitro by measuring the inhibition of e.g. recombinant human cathepsin K.<br>
The in vitro assay is carried out as follows:<br><br>
The assay is performed in 96 well microtiter plates at ambient temperature using recombinant human cathepsin K. Inhibition of cathepsin K is assayed at a constant enzyme (0.16 nM) and substrate concentration (54 mM Z-Phe-Arg-AMCA - Peptide Institute Inc. Osaka, Japan) in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 2 mM dithiothreitol, 20 mM Tween 80 and 1 mM EDTA. Cathepsin K is preincubated with the inhibitors for 30 min, and the reaction is initiated by the addition of substrate. After 30 min incubation the reaction is stopped by the addition of E-64 (2 mM), and fluorescence intensity is read on a multi-well plate reader at excitation and emission wavelengths of 360 and 460 nm, respectively.<br>
Compounds of the Invention typically have IC50s for inhibition of human cathepsin K of less than about 100 nM down to about 1 nM or less, preferably of about 5 nM or less, e.g. about 0.2 nM. Example 3-0 has a IC50 in the above described assay of about 0.16 nM. Preferred are compounds as defined above with R = Rl, e.g. compounds of examples 1 to 4 with R = Rl, which have cathepsin K inhibitory effects. More preferred are compounds as defined above with R = R5, most preferred Example 3-0.<br>
The cathepsin S inhibitory effects of the compound of the invention can be demonstrated in vitro by measuring the inhibition of e.g. recombinant human cathepsin S.<br>
The in vitro assay is carried out in clear, flat-bottomed, 96-well microtiter plates (Greiner GmbH, Germany) at ambient temperature using recombinant human cathepsin S. Inhibition of human cathepsin S is assayed at a constant enzyme and various substrate concentrations (substrate is Z-Leu-Leu-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide (Bachem (Switzerland)) in 100 parts 0.2M sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 2 mM EDTA, 2 parts 1% Triton X-100, 10 parts 20 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 58 parts distilled water. The assay is started by adding the enzyme solution (13 times higher concentration of final concentration of recombinant human Cathepsin S) to the reaction mixture containing various concentrations of the corresponding substrate and the compound. Substrate concentrations between 3.4 and 17 μM are used. The recombinant human Cathepsin S is used at a final concentration of 0.04 nM. Test compounds are used at concentrations between 0.4 and 2 times the determined IC50 of the compound at the enzyme. The relative fluorescence is continuously measured for 30 minutes and the initial velocity is obtained from each progress curve. The inhibition patterns and the Kj values are determined by Dixon plot analysis.<br><br>
Compounds of the Invention typically have IC50s for inhibition of human cathepsin S of less than about 100 nM down to about 1 nM or less, preferably of about 5 nM or less. Preferred compounds are compounds as defined above with R = R2.E.g. example 4-8 has a IC50 in the above described assay of about 9 nM.<br>
Compounds of the Invention which have dual inhibitory effects, i.e. inhibitory effects in the cathepsin K and the cathepsin S assay as described above typically have IC50s for inhibition of human cathepsin S and of cathepsin K of less than about 100 nM in both assays, down to about 1 nM or less in both assays, preferably of about 5 nM or less. Preferred compounds with a dual inhibitory effect are compounds as defined above with R = R6. E.g. example 4-3 with an IC50 on human cathepsin K of 8 nM and on human cathepsin S of 6 nM. Or example 4-9 with an IC50 on human cathepsin K of 16 nM and on human cathepsin S of 10 nM.<br>
In view of their activity as inhibitors of cathepsin K and/or cathepsin S, compounds of the invention are particularly useful in mammals as agents for treatment and prophylaxis of diseases and medical conditions involving elevated levels of cathepsin K and/or cathepsin S. Such diseases include diseases involving infection by organisms such as Pneumocystis carinii, trypsanoma cruzi, trypsanoma brucei, crithidia fusiculata, as well as parasitic diseases such as schistosomiasis and malaria, tumours (tumour invasion and tumour metastasis), and other diseases such as metachromatic leukodystrophy, muscular dystrophy, amytrophy, neuropathic pain, e.g. chronic neuropathic pain, exemplified by conditions such as diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, trigeminal neuralgia, painful diabetic polyneuropathy, post-stroke pain (central pain), postamputation pain, myolopathic or radiculopathy pain (e.g. spinal stenosis, arachnoiditis, root sleeve fibrosis), atypical facial pain and causalgia-like syndromes (complex regional pain syndromes), autoimmune disorders, including, but not limited to juvenile onset diabetes and multiple sclerosis, allergic disorders, including, but not limited to, asthma, and allogeneic immune responses, including, but not limited to, organ transplant rejection.<br>
In particular, cathepsin K has been implicated in diseases of excessive bone loss,.and thus the Compounds of the Invention may be used for treatment and prophylaxis of such diseases, including osteoporosis, osteoporosis of various genesis (e.g. juvenile, menopausal, postmenopausal, post-traumatic, caused by old age or by cortico-steroid therapy or inactivity),<br><br>
gingival diseases such as gingivitis and periodontitis, Paget's disease, hypercalcemia of malignancy, e.g. tumour-induced hypercalcemia and metabolic bone disease. Also the Compounds of the Invention may be use for treatment or prophylaxis of diseases of excessive cartilage or matrix degradation, including osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis as well as certain neoplastic diseases involving expression of high levels of proteolytic enzymes and matrix degradation. Preferably cathepsin K inhibitors are used in the treatment of osteoporosis and osteoarthritis.<br>
In particular, cathepsin S has been implicated in the treatment and also in the prevention of neuropathic pain, e.g. chronic neuropathic pain, exemplified by conditions such as diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, trigeminal neuralgia, painful diabetic polyneuropathy, post-stroke pain (central pain), postamputation pain, myolopathic or radiculopathic pain (e.g. spinal stenosis, arachnoiditis, root sleeve fibrosis), atypical facial pain and causalgia-like syndromes (complex regional pain syndromes), osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune disorders, including, but not limited to juvenile onset diabetes and multiple sclerosis, allergic disorders, including, but not limited to, asthma, and allogeneic immune responses, including, but not limited to, organ transplant rejection. Preferably cathepsin S inhibitors are used in the treatment of neuropathic pain, multiple sclerosis, osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.<br>
Dual inhibitors may thus be implicated in diseases of where both cathepsins play a role, e.g. neuropathic pain, inflammation, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, tumors (especially tumor invasion and tumor metastasis), obesity, coronary disease, atherosclerosis (including atherosclerotic plaque rupture and destabilization), autoimmune diseases, multiple sclerosis, respiratory diseases, infectious diseases and immunologically mediated diseases (including transplant rejection), preferably neuropathic pain, osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteoarthritis.<br>
Beneficial effects are evaluated in in vitro and in vivo pharmacological tests generally known in the art, and as illustrated herein. The above cited properties are demonstrable in in vitro and in vivo tests, using advantageously mammals, e.g. rats, mice, dogs, rabbits, monkeys or isolated organs and tissues, as well as mammalian enzyme preparations, either natural or prepared by e.g. recombinant technology. Compounds of the Invention can be applied in vitro in the form of solutions, e.g. preferably aqueous solutions or suspensions, and in vivo either enterally or<br><br>
parenterally, advantageously orally, e.g. as a suspension or in aqueous solution, or as a solid capsule or tablet formulation. The dosage in vitro may range between about 10-5 molar and 10"9 molar concentrations. The dosage in vivo may range, depending on the route of administration, between about 0.1 and 100 mg/kg.<br>
The efficacy of the Compounds of the Invention for the treatment of osteoporosis can be determined using the In vivo animal model "OVX cynomolgus monkey". This model is well known in the art and is a common model to validate an osteoporosis compound (see e.g. Jerome CP, Peterson PE (2001) Bone; 29 (l):l-6).<br>
The efficacy of the Compounds of the Invention for the treatment of chronic inflammatory or neuropathic pain can be determined using the following In vivo animal models:<br>
Chronic inflammatory pain model:<br>
The Complete Freund's Adjuvant -induced mechanical hyperalgesia may be used as a model of chronic inflammatory pain (Stein, C. et al. Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. (1988) 31 :445-451). In this model, typically a male Sprague-Dawley or Wistar rat (200-250 g) receives an intraplantar injection of 25 jil complete Freund's adjuvant into one hind paw. A marked inflammation occurs in this hind paw. Drugs are generally administered for evaluation of efficacy, 24 hours after the inflammatory insult, when mechanical hyperalgesia is considered fully established.<br>
Chronic neuropathic pain models:<br>
Two animal models of chronic neuropathic pain may be used that involve some form of peripheral nerve damage. In the Seltzer model (Seltzer et al. (1990) Pain 43: 205-218) rats are anaesthetised and a small incision made mid-way up one thigh (usually the left) to expose the sciatic nerve. The nerve is carefully cleared of surrounding connective tissues at a site near the trochanter just distal to the point at which the posterior biceps semitendinosus nerve branches off the common sciatic nerve. A 7-0 silk suture is inserted into the nerve with a 3/8 curved, reversed-cutting mini-needle, and tightly ligated so that the dorsal 1/3 to 1/2 of the nerve thickness is held within the ligature. The muscle and skin are closed with sutures and clips and the wound dusted with antibiotic powder. In sham animals the sciatic nerve is exposed but not ligated and the wound closed as in nonsham animals.<br><br>
In the Chronic Constriction Injury (CCI) model (Bennett, G.J. and Xie, Y.K. Pain (1988) 33: 87-107) rats are anaesthetised and a small incision is made mid-way up one thigh (usually the left) to expose the sciatic nerve. The nerve is cleared of surrounding connective tissue and four ligatures of 4/0 chromic gut are tied loosely around the nerve with approximately 1mm between each, so that the ligatures just barely constrict the surface of the nerve. The wound is closed with sutures and clips as described above. In sham animals the sciatic nerve is exposed but not ligated and the wound closed as in nonsham animals.<br>
In contrast to the Seltzer and CCI models, the Chung model involves ligation of the spinal nerve. (Kim, S.O. and Chung, J.M. Pain (1992): 50:355-363). In this model, rats are anesthetized and placed into a prone position and an incision is made to the left of the spine at the L4-S2 level. A deep dissection through the paraspinal muscles and separation of the muscles from the spinal processes at the L4-S2 level will reveal part of the sciatic nerve as it branches to form the L4, L5 and L6 spinal nerves. The L6 transverse process is carefully removed with a small rongeur enabling visualisation of these spinal nerves. The L5 spinal nerve is isolated and tightly ligated with 7-0 silk suture. The wound is closed with a single muscle suture (6-0 silk) and one or two skin closure clips and dusted with antibiotic powder. In sham animals the L5 nerve is exposed as before but not ligated and the wound closed as before.<br>
Behavioral index<br>
In all chronic pain models (inflammatory and neuropathic) mechanical hyperalgesia is assessed by measuring paw withdrawal thresholds of both hindpaws to an increasing pressure stimulus using an Analgesymeter (Ugo-Basile, Milan). Mechanical allodynia is assessed by measuring withdrawal thresholds to non-noxious mechanical stimuli applied with von Frey hairs to the plantar surface of both hindpaws. Thermal hyperalgesia is assessed by measuring withdrawal latencies to a noxious thermal stimulus applied to the underside of each hindpaw. With all models, mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia develop within 1 - 3 days following surgery and persist for at least 50 days. For the assays described herein, drugs may be applied before and after surgery to assess their effect on the development of hyperalgesia, particularly approximately 14 days following surgery, to determine their ability to reverse established hyperalgesia.<br>
The percentage reversal of hyperalgesia is calculated as follows:<br><br><br>
In the experiments disclosed herein, Wistar rats (male) are employed in the pain models described above. Rats weigh approximately 120-140 grams at the time of surgery. All surgery is performed under enflurane/02 inhalation anaesthesia. In all cases the wound is closed after the procedure and the animal allowed to recover. In all pain models employed, after a few days in all but the sham operated animals, a marked mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia and allodynia develops in which there is a lowering of pain threshold and an enhanced reflex withdrawal response of the hind-paw to touch, pressure or thermal stimuli. After surgery the animals also exhibit characteristic changes to the affected paw. In the majority of animals the toes of the affected hind paw are held together and the foot turned slightly to one side; in some rats the toes are also curled under. The gait of the ligated rats varies, but limping is uncommon. Some rats are seen to raise the affected hind paw from the cage floor and to demonstrate an unusual rigid extension of the hind limb when held. The rats tend to be very sensitive to touch and may vocalise. Otherwise the general health an condition of the rats is good.<br>
Compounds of the invention, are also indicated for preventing or treating coronary disease, atherosclerosis (including atherosclerotic plaque rupture and destabilization) (see e.g. Cathepsin F and S block HDL3-induced cholesterol efflux from macrophage cells, Lindstedt et al., 2003, Biochemical and Biophysical research communications 312: 1019-1024), autoimmune diseases, respiratory diseases and immunologically mediated diseases (including transplant rejection).<br>
The antiarthritic efficacy of the compounds of the invention for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis can be determined using models such as or similar to the rat model of adjuvant arthritis, as described previously (R.E. Esser, et. al. J. Rheumatology, 1993, 20, 1176.)<br>
The efficacy of the compounds of the invention for the treatment of osteoarthritis can be determined using models such as or similar to the rabbit partial lateral meniscectomy model, as described previously (Colombo et al.
