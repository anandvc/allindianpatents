				<td>Field of the Invention;<br><br>
The present disclosure relates to devices used in the mounting of electrical and communications components and the like on structures, and more specifically to a flush mount fixture with a snap assembly. Bacicground of the Invention:<br>
In the mounting of fixtures like switches, receptacles and the like In the interior of buildings, it is a common practice to mount these electrical junction boxes to the wall, ceiling or other members of the building's structure. Flush-mount boxes give the appearance of being attached to the surface of the building and do not require attachment to a stud or other building frame member and yet they are secure and esthetically acceptable. The Flush Mount backs can be recessed into concrete block construction or mounted back-to-back in existing non-contact visitation windows to maximize the use of available space. The fixtures may either be electrical such as switches, plug points or network related such as Ethernet cable receptacle etc.<br><br>
Figure 1 (a) describes the conventional flush mount fixture in ideal condition. The fixture assembly consists of a flush mount box (3), fixing frame (5), center plate (1) and outer frame (2). The flush mount box is embedded onto the wall and closed with a fixing frame. The fixing frame is fastened to the flush mount box by a fastening means such as a screw (4) as per the present embodiment. However it is possible that the fixing frame is fixed on the wall itself.. The center plate (also called the face plate or end plate) can be covered plate or may contain switches or the like. The outer frame is placed on to the fixing frame and is held by the center plate snapfit to the fixing frame to provide flush finishing. The center plate contains snap engagement on the ends of the plate to enable fasten it to the fixing frame. This snap engagement is fixed and therefore the placement should be perfect to enable a proper fixing for sturdiness and aesthetic value. In ideal condition, where the walls are smooth the flush mount fixture can be assembled easily without any problem, however on uneven walls these do not properly fit and such unevenness either leaves gaps or is not properly fitted leading to protrusion of the fixtures outside the wall.<br><br>
Fig 1 (b) describes a conventional flush mount fixture where the wall is uneven. In this scenario the wall around the frame is recessed and the flush mount box and the frame are protruding above the surface of the wall. The snaps (7) on the end plate do not provide the required fastening as there is a clearance which arises due to the difference in the height of the frame and the flush mount box. This clearance gives rise to a play and thus loosening of the center plate with the outer frame.<br><br>
Fig 1 (c) describes another scenario of the conventional flush mount fixture where the wall around the frame is protruding out leading to a protruding outer frame and the flush mount box and the frame is recessed below the surface of the wall. The snaps (8) on the center plate do not provide the properly fasten with the flush mount box and the fixing frame as the snaps do not completely reach the required level for a perfect snap and thus is not fitted properly to the fixing frame.<br><br>
Therefore there is a need for a snap design to accommodate the unevenness in the wall and provide for proper fitting.<br><br>
Summary of the Invention;<br><br>
The present disclosure provides a novel and inventive design of a snap assembly on the center plate snap which can accommodate the unevenness in the wall and fixture.<br><br>
The present disclosure defines a snap assembly on an center plate of a flush mount fixture, the center plate being snap fitted with a fixing plate on a flush mount box, the assembly comprising plurality of snap members positioned near each other wherein at least one said snap member having serration on the outer surface of the member and the serrated surface being outwardly inclined from a desired position on the member leading towards the top end of the member. The snap assembly also comprises non-serrated snap members having protrusion on the outer surface of the member to enable positive locking of the center plate with the fixing frame on the flush mount box. The serrated snap members on snap assembly provide griping between the center plate and fixing frame.<br><br>
The present disclosure also defines a flush mount fixture comprising a flush mount box embedded onto the wall, a fixing frame connected to the flush mount box by a fastening means, a center plate being snapped to fixing frame on the flush mount box and a outer frame fastened to the fixture by means of the center plate to enable flush finishing, wherein the said center plate is fastened to the fixing frame by means of a snap assembly comprising plurality of snap members positioned near each other wherein at least one said snap member having serration on the outer surface of the member and the serrated surface being outwardly inclined from a desired position on the member leading towards the top end of the member. The serrated snap members on the snap assembly provide griping between the center plate and fixing frame.<br><br>

Figure 3 (b) describes a cross section diagram of fixture with the snap according to the present invention in uneven wall of negative clearance.<br><br>
Figure 3 (c) describes a cross section diagram of fixture with the snap according to the present invention in uneven wall of negative clearance.<br><br>
Figure 4 (a) &amp; 4 (b) describes a cross section view of the flush mount assembly with the snap assembly.<br><br>
Detailed Description:<br><br>
Figure 2 defines a novel design for a center plate (1) with an adjustable snap fitting design. The center plate contains plurality of snaps placed together to form an assembly. This assembly is positioned at the two opposite sides on the center plate. The snap members can also be placed at all four ends also for a strong hold; however the present disclosure defines an embodiment with snap members on two sides.<br>
The snap assembly has plurality of snap members (10) where at least one of the snap members has serration (11) towards the outer end as shown in the figure 2. These serrations help in maintaining good grip between fixing frame and center plate. The serrations on the outside are on an inclined surface of the snap member. The outer surface of the serrated snap members has inclined faces with the serrations on them. The outward inclination of the faces are from a predefined position on the outer face, inclined towards the outside to form an angular inclination as it goes towards the top end. The top end may end with a sharp inward inclination. <br>
The present embodiment of snap assembly provides three snap members with two serrated members and one non-serrated. However they can also be designed with plurality of such serrated members and plurality of non serrated members.<br><br>
The non-serrated members have sharp protrusion (12) in the outward direction. This protrusion forms a locking means providing positive locking with the fixing frame and thus fastens the center plate with the fixing frame. The non-serrated snap member protrudes a little the outside the serrated members to enable locking.<br><br>
In the present disclosure the middle snap member is a non serrated member and has a protrusion to enable locking.<br><br>
The snap assembly contains ribs placed on the inside which supports the snap member with the center frame. The ribs are placed between the inner surface of the said members and the floor of the center plate. These ribs provide tensile strength to the snap members. Amount of deflection undergoing by snap member is proportional to the tensile strength provided by the ribs. The ribs on the serrated and non-serrated snaps are different so the stress developed is also different. The ribs (14) on the serrated snaps are designed sturdy to facilitate good holding between the center plate and the fixing frame. However the ribs (13) on the non serrated snap members are comparably flexible to enable them undergo more deformation and facilitate easy installation and removal. <br><br>
The pullout force is defined as the force required for removal of the center plate from the fixing frame. The more flexible the rib on the non-serrated locking snaps the lower the pullout force. Therefore the positive locking and pull out force can be easily adjusted with the help of rib design.<br><br>
Figure 3 (a) describes a cross section diagram of fixture with the snap assembly in accordance with the present invention during an ideal condition. In this condition the snap members (31) are at an optimum distance and fixes with the center plate.<br><br>
Figure 3 (b) describes a cross section diagram of fixture with the snap according to the present invention on an uneven wall with negative clearance. In this scenario the snap assembly (32) with the serrations on the serrated snap members are engaged with the fixing plate and thus at an optimum level they are stable to negate the positive clearance. These serrated snap members provide griping and holds the center plate to the fixing frame. The non serrated snap member with a protrusion acts as a locking means to avoid removal from the fixing frame by providing a positive locking. <br><br>
Therefore the center plate is fixed to the fixing frame without any gap and there is a flush finish between the center plate and the fixing frame.<br><br>
Figure 3 (c) describes a cross section diagram of fixture with the snap according to the present invention in uneven wall of positive clearance. In this scenario the snap members (33) with the serrations on the serrated snap members are engaged with the fixing plate and thus at an optimum level they are stable. These serrations extent to a level such that it provides for grip at that extent. These serrated snap members provide griping and holds the center plate to the fixing frame. The non serrated snap member with a protrusion acts as a locking means to avoid removal from the fixing frame by providing a positive locking. Therefore the center plate is fixed to the fixing frame without protrusion and there is a flush finish between the center plate and the fixing frame.<br><br>
Figure 4 shows a cross section of the assembly with the snap assembly on the centre plate. Figure 4 (A) shows a section where the serrated snap is snapped to the frame. Figure 4 (B) shows a section where the non serrated snap is locked with the fixing frame.<br><br>
