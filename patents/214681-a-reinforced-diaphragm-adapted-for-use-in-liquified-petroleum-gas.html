				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a process for producing a diaphragm for use in liquified petroleum gas or methane vaporizer of an internal combustion engine.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
The use of diaphragms in a vaporizer and the process for the preparation thereof is known in the art. The process comprises in terminating the cotton fabric with an elastomer such as acrylic nitrial butaline. The fabric so obtained is then cut and moulded to the required shape and fitted with the fitments like washer and rivets etc. There are disadvantages associated with the prior art.<br>
One of the main disadvantage is that the diaphragms for use in liquified petroleum gas or methane vaporizers of internal combustion engines are normally subjected to high pressures and temperatures and also to the freezing temperature and thereby resulting in a rapid wear and tear of the diaphragm. Further due to the presence of such severe conditions. The reinforcement provided with such diaphragms tends to disintegrate or separate from the base substrate.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
An  object of this invention is to propose  a reinforced  diaphragm and to a method of producing  said diaphragm for use in liquified petroleum gas or  methane vaporizers of internal combustion engines.<br>
Another  abject  of  this  invention  is   to propose a method  of producing a  diaphragm   which  can withstand   the  conditions  of  high  temperature   and pressure.<br>
Still another object  of  this  invention  in to propose a method of producing a diaphragm wherein the reinforcement does not severe from the base substrate of said diaphragm.<br>
Yet  another object of  this invention is  to propose   a method of producing diaphragm   wherein  the reinforcement does not severe from the base substrate of said  diaphragm.<br>
Still another object of this invention is  to propose a method of producing a diaphragm   wherein  the diaphragm has the required physical properties.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided a process for producing a diaphragm for use in liquified petroleum gas or methane vaporizer of an internal combustion engine comprising:<br>
i)        preheating a polyester fabric at a temperature of 50°-70°C for a period of 2-3 hours;<br>
ii)       applying a bonding agent to the fabric and then allowing it to dry characterized in that;<br>
iii)      applying an elastomer wherein composition as herein described  on said fabric by the step of coating or<br>
spreading;<br>
iv)	curing the coated fabric as herein described;<br>
v)	cutting the fabric to the required size;<br>
vi)	shaping the cut fabric to a diaphragm by press moulding;<br>
vii)	adhering a paper gasket to the fastening section of the diaphragm;<br>
viii)	securing metallic washers in the centre of the shaped diaphragm;<br>
ix)	forming holes in said fastening section and cutting outer periphery.<br>
In accordance with this invention a polyester<br>
fabric is heated under stretched conditions at the temperature of 50-700C for a period of 2—3 hours. The<br>
fabric after heating is coated with a bonding agent for example isocyanate adhesive mixed with a solvent such as<br>
methyl ethyl ketone in the ratio of 1:3— 5 to provide maximum bonding strength to the fabric. The coated<br>
fabric with bonding agent is then subjected to the step of air drying in a dust and dirt free atmosphere. A<br>
layer of an elastomer consisting of a co-polymer of vinylidene fluoride and hexa fluoro propylene.<br>
oxide,  carbon  black  and calcium  hydroxide  onto  the<br>
fabric by the step of coating/spreading.  The fabric  so<br>
obtained  is  then cured and subsequently cut  into  the<br>
pieces  of the required size.   The cut pieces are  then<br>
shaped by press  moulding in the form of a diaphragm.  A<br><br><br>
 paper  gasket is then adhered to the fastening   <br><br>
section of  the diaphragm and then the holes are formed  <br><br>
in  the fastening section.<br>
A reinforced diaphragm for use in a vaporizer<br>
used  for  supplying liquified petroleum gas or  methane<br>
as  a  fuel  to an internal combustion  engine  and  the<br>
process  for  the  preparation thereof  according  to  a preferred embodiment is herein described and illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherein :<br>
Fig.1   shows a plan  view of the diaphragm Fig.1A  shows sectional view of the diaphragm<br>
Fig.2   shows plan view of the diaphragm according to an<br>
option. Fig.2A  shows sectional view of the diaphragm<br>
Fig.3   shows  plan view of the diaphragm  according  to<br>
another option.<br>
Fig.3A  shows sectional view of the diaphragm  according to another option.<br>
Referring to  the drawings particularly fig.l<br>
and 1A, the diaphragm has a convoluted diaphragm 1  made of reinforced polyester fabric.  Oil resistance gasket 2<br>
is  provided  at  the periphery  of  the   diaphragm  1. Washers  3 and 4  are? provided at the upper surface  and<br>
lower  surface of the diaphragm by means of a rivet 5 in the  centre  of  the diaphragm.  A  metallic  spacer  is<br>
provided at the upper surface, of the upper washer 3.   A rubber O-ring 7 (fig.lA) is provided below the  metallic<br>
spacers 5 in order to stop the leakage of the fuel  from the diaphragm.<br>
As shown in fig.2 and 2A, the diaphragm is of<br>
the  same description as described  herein   above  with reference  to fig.l and fig.lA.  However, the washers  3<br>
and  4  are secured with the diaphragm by  means   of  a rivet 5 directly without providing a spacer.<br>
Reference is now made to fig.3 and 3A wherein<br>
the  diaphragm  according to a second option  is  shown.<br>
The  construction  of  the  diaphragm  is  the  same  as<br>
described  herein above with reference to fig.l and  1A.<br>
However,  a  magnet holding insert 8 having a  magnet  9<br>
secured  therewith is provided on  the upper surface  of<br>
the convoluted diaphragm ? and the washer 3 &amp; 4 are  not<br>
used.<br>
In  accordance  with  the  process  of   this invention  the  polyester fabric is first heated   at  a temperature  of  500C-700C for a period  of  2-3  hours. After  heating the fabric the bonding agent for  example isocyanate adhesive mixed with a solvent such as  methyl ethyl ketone in the ratio of is3-5 is applied on to  the fabric  and  on both sides thereof.  The  coated  fabric<br>
*<br>
thus obtained is subjected to the step of air drying in a dust and dirt free atmosphere. A coating of elastomer<br>
comprising 100 parts of copolymer of vinylidene fluoride and hexa fluoro propylene, 10-20 parts magnesium oxide,<br>
3-8 parts carbon black and 3-6 parts calcium  hydroxide.<br><br>
10—25  parts  of talcum powder,  mixed with  each  other homogeneously  is  applied  on both  the  sides  of  the<br>
convoluted   diaphragm  by  the  step  of   coating   or spreading.  The coated fabric so obtained is then  press<br>
cured   at  the  temperature  of  150—170°C  by   simple compression  moulding for a period of 10—25 minutes. The<br>
fabric  so obtained is then cut into the pieces  of  the required size and which  is then shaped in the form of a<br>
plan  flat diaphragm.  The plane diaphragm is then  post formed  to convoluted form, dish form, hat form or  flat<br>
form  by a short heat treatment in a simple mould  press of  the required shape.  A paper gasket is then  adhered<br>
to the periphery of the diaphragm and then the holes are formed  in the fastening  section for  facilitating  the<br>
holding of the diaphragm in the, vaporizers.  The washers 3  and  4  one are then secured in  the  centre  of  the<br>
moulded diaphragm by riveting.<br>
The  elastomer consisting of the  ingredients<br>
in  the  ratio as mentioned herein is seasoned  for  2—3 days  and then again processed in a mixing mill so  that.<br>
the  constituents  are  finely   dispersed/homogeneously mixed   with  each  other.   A  solvent   methyl   ethyl<br>
ketone/methy1  isoprnpyl  butyl ketone is added  to  the<br>
elastomeric  compound  in   the  ratio  of  1:1.5-3   to<br>
facilitate  the application of the elastomer on  to  the<br>
fabric by the step of spreading or coating with the help<br>
of  doctors  knife  and drying quickly  by  warming  the<br>
spreading  table to a temperature  above than  45°C  and<br>
less  than  60°C.  The coats are provided  on  both  the<br>
sides  repeatedly to obtain the required   thickness  of<br>
0.19 to 0.35 mm of the fabric.<br>
The  shapes of the diaphragm as shown in  the<br>
drawings  are given to illustrated the  construction  of<br>
the diaphragm.  However, the invention is not limited to<br>
these shapes.  The shape  of the diaphragm can be   made<br>
as  per  the  requirement  of  the  vaporizers  used  in<br>
different kind of engines.<br><br><br><br>
