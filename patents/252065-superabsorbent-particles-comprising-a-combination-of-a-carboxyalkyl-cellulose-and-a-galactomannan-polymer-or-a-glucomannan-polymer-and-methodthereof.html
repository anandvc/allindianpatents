				<td>SUPERABSORBENT PARTICLES CONTAINING CARBOXYALKYL CELLULOSE AND METHODS FOR THEIR PREPARATION<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Personal care absorbent products, such as infant diapers, adult incontinent pads, and feminine care products, typically contain an absorbent core that includes superabsorbent polymer particles distributed within a fibrous matrix. Superabsorbents are water-swellable, generally water-insoluble absorbent materials having a high absorbent capacity for body fluids. Superabsorbent polymers (SAPs) in common use are mostly derived from acrylic acid, which is itself derived from petroleum oil, a non-renewable raw material. Acrylic acid polymers and SAPs are generally recognized as not being biodegradable. Despite their wide use, some segments of the absorbent products market are concerned about the use of non-renewable petroleum oil derived materials and their non-biodegradable nature. Acrylic acid based polymers also comprise a meaningful portion of the cost structure of diapers and incontinent pads. Users of SAP are interested in lower cost SAPs. The high cost derives in part from the cost structure for the manufacture of acrylic acid which, in turn, depends upon the fluctuating price of petroleum oil. Also, when diapers are discarded after use they normally contain considerably less than their maximum or theoretical content of body fluids. In other words, in terms of their fluid holding capacity, they are "over-designed". This "over-design" constitutes an inefficiency in the use of SAP. The inefficiency results in part from the fact that SAPs are designed to have high gel strength (as demonstrated by high absorbency under load or AUL). The high gel strength (upon swelling) of currently<br>
used SAP particles helps them to retain a lot of void space between particles, which is helpful for rapid fluid uptake. However, this high "void volume" simultaneously results in there being a lot of interstitial (between particle) liquid in the product in the saturated state. When there is a lot of interstitial liquid the "rewet" value or "wet feeling" of an absorbent product is compromised.<br>
In personal care absorbent products, U.S. southern pine fluff pulp is commonly used in conjunction with the SAP. This fluff is recognized worldwide as the preferred fiber for absorbent products. The preference is based on the fluff pulp's advantageous high fiber length (about 2.8 mm) and its relative ease of processing from a wetland pulp sheet to an airlaid web. Fluff pulp is also made from renewable and biodegradable cellulose pulp fibers. Compared to SAP, these fibers are inexpensive on a per mass basis, but tend to be more expensive on a per unit of liquid held basis. These fluff pulp fibers mostly absorb within the interstices between fibers. For this reason, a fibrous matrix readily releases acquired liquid on application of pressure. The tendency to release acquired liquid can result in significant skin wetness during use of an absorbent product that includes a core formed exclusively from cellulosic fibers. Such products also tend to leak acquired liquid because liquid is not effectively retained in such a fibrous absorbent core.<br>
Superabsorbent composite particles prepared from renewable natural polymers have advantages over superabsorbent particles obtained from petroleum oil based synthetic polymers in lower cost, biodegradability and being derived from renewable natural polymers. As such there is a need for new superabsorbent compositions derived from renewable natural polymers.<br>
A need therefore exists for a composite superabsorbent material that is simultaneously derived from biodegradable renewable resources like cellulose and that is inexpensive. In this way, the superabsorbent material can be used in absorbent product designs that are efficient. These and other objectives are accomplished by the invention set forth below.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention provides superabsorbent particles that include carboxyalkyl cellulose. The particles include a combination of a carboxyalkyl cellulose and a<br>
galactomannan polymer or a glucomannan polymer, and a plurality of non-permanent metal crosslinks.<br>
The invention also provides a method for making superabsorbent particles that include carboxyalkyl cellulose. In the method, a carboxyalkyl cellulose and a galactomannan polymer or a glucomannan polymer are blended in water to provide an aqueous solution; the aqueous solution treated with a crosslinking agent to provide a gel; the gel dried to provide a solid; and the solid comminuted to provide a plurality of particles. In one embodiment, the particles are flakes.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In one aspect, the present invention provides superabsorbent particles that contain carboxyalkyl cellulose. The particles include a combination of a carboxyalkyl cellulose and a galactomannan polymer or a glucomannan polymer, and a plurality of non-permanent metal crosslinks.<br>
The particles include a carboxyalkyl cellulose. Suitable carboxyalkyl celluloses have a degree of carboxyl group substitution of from about 0.3 to about 2.5, and in one embodiment have a degree of carboxyl group substitution of from about 0.5 to about 1.5. In one embodiment, the carboxyalkyl cellulose is carboxymethyl cellulose. The particles include from about 60 to about 99% by weight carboxyalkyl cellulose based on the total weight of carboxyalkyl cellulose and galactomannan or glucomannan polymer. In one embodiment, the particles include from about 80 to about 95% by weight carboxyalkyl cellulose based on the total weight of carboxyalkyl cellulose and galactomannan or glucomannan polymer.<br>
The particles include a galactomannan polymer or a glucomannan polymer. Suitable galactomannan polymers include guar gum, locust bean gum, and tara gum. Suitable glucomannan polymers include konjac gum. The galactomannan polymer or glucomannan polymer can be from natural sources or obtained from genetically-modified plants. The particles include from about 1 to about 20% by weight galactomannan polymer or glucomannan polymer based on the total weight of the carboxyalkyl cellulose and galactomannan or glucomannan polymer, and in one embodiment, the particles include from about 1 to about 15% by weight galactomannan polymer or glucomannan<br>
polymer based on the total weight of the carboxyalkyl cellulose and galactomannan or glucomannan polymer.<br>
The particles are substantially insoluble in water while being capable of absorbing water. The particles are rendered water insoluble by a plurality of non-permanent interpolymer metal crosslinks.<br>
The particles have intermolecular metal crosslinks between polymer molecules. The metal crosslink arises as a consequence of an associative interaction (e.g., bonding) between functional groups on the polymers (e.g., carboxy, carboxylate, or hydroxyl groups) and a multi-valent metal species. Suitable multi-valent metal species include metal ions having a valency of three or greater and that are capable of forming an associative interaction with a polymer (e.g., reactive toward associative interaction with the polymer's carboxy, carboxylate, or hydroxyl groups). The polymers are intermolecularly crosslinked when the multi-valent metal species forms an associative interaction with functional groups on two or more polymer molecules. A crosslink may be formed within one polymer molecule or may be formed between two or more polymer molecules. The extent of crosslinking affects the water solubility of the particles and the ability of the particles to swell on contact with an aqueous liquid.<br>
The particles include non-permanent metal crosslinks formed both intermolecularly and intramolecularly in the population of polymer molecules. As used herein, the term "non-permanent crosslink" refers to the metal crosslink formed with two or more functional groups of a polymer molecule (intramolecularly) or formed with two or more functional groups of two or more polymer molecules (intermolecularly). It will be appreciated that the process of dissociating and re-associating (breaking and reforming crosslinks) the multi-valent metal ion and polymer molecules is dynamic and also occurs during liquid acquisition. During water acquisition the individual particles swell and change to gel state. The ability of non-permanent metal crosslinks to dissociate and associate under water acquisition imparts greater freedom to the gels to expand than if it was restrictively crosslinked by permanent crosslinks that do not have the ability to dissociate and reassociate. Covalent organic crosslinks such as ether crosslinks are permanent crosslinks that do not have the ability to dissociate and reassociate.<br>
In one aspect, the present invention provides a method for making superabsorbent particles containing carboxyalkyl cellulose. The method includes the steps of<br>
 (a) blending a carboxyalkyl cellulose and either a galactomannan polymer or a glucomannan polymer in water to provide an aqueous solution; (b) treating the aqueous solution with a first crosslinking agent to provide a gel; (c) drying the gel to provide a solid; and (d) comminuting the solid to provide a plurality of particles.<br>
In the process, a carboxyalkyl cellulose and either a galactomannan polymer or a glucomannan polymer are blended in water to provide an aqueous solution. Suitable carboxyalkyl celluloses have a degree of carboxyl group substitution of from about 0.3 to about 2.5, and in one embodiment have a degree of carboxyl group substitution of from about 0.5 to about 1.5. In one embodiment, the carboxyalkyl cellulose is carboxymethyl cellulose. The aqueous solution includes from about 60 to about 99% by weight carboxyalkyl cellulose based on the weight of carboxyalkyl cellulose and galactomannan or glucomannan polymers. In one embodiment, the aqueous solution includes from about 80 to about 95% by weight carboxyalkyl cellulose based on the weight of carboxyalkyl cellulose and galactomannan or glucomannan polymers.<br>
The aqueous solution also includes a galactomannan polymer or a glucomannan polymer. Suitable galactomannan polymers include guar gum, locust bean gum, and tara gum. Suitable glucomannan polymers include konjac gum. The galactomannan polymer or glucomannan polymer can be from natural sources or obtained from genetically-modified plants. The aqueous solution includes from about 1 to about 20% by weight galactomannan polymer or glucomannan polymer based on the weight of the carboxyalkyl cellulose and galactomannan or glucomannan polymers, and in one embodiment, the aqueous solution includes from about 1 to about 15% by weight galactomannan polymer or glucomannan polymer based on the weight of the carboxyalkyl cellulose and galactomannan or glucomannan polymers.<br>
In the method, the aqueous solution including the carboxyalkyl cellulose and galactomannan polymer or glucomannan polymer is treated with a crosslinking agent to provide a gel.<br>
Suitable crosslinking agents include crosslinking agents that are reactive towards hydroxyl groups and carboxyl groups. Representative crosslinking agents include metallic crosslinking agents, such as aluminum (III) compounds, titanium (IV) compounds, bismuth (III) compounds, boron (III) compounds, and zirconium (IV)<br>
compounds. The numerals in parentheses in the preceding list of metallic crosslinking agents refers to the valency of the metal.<br>
Representative metallic crosslinking agents include aluminum sulfate; aluminum hydroxide; dihydroxy aluminum acetate (stabilized with boric acid); other aluminum salts of carboxylic acids and inorganic acids; other aluminum complexes, such as Ultrion 8186 from Nalco Company (aluminum chloride hydroxide); boric acid; sodium metaborate; ammonium zirconium carbonate (AZC); zirconium compounds containing inorganic ions or organic ions or neutral ligands; bismuth ammonium citrate (BAG); other bismuth salts of carboxylic acids and inorganic acids; titanium (IV) compounds, such as titanium (IV) bis(triethylaminato) bis(isopropoxide) (commercially available from the Dupont Company under the designation Tyzor TE); and other titanates with alkoxide or carboxylate ligands.<br>
The crosslinking agent is effective for intermolecularly crosslinking the carboxyalkyl cellulose (with or without carboxyalkyl hemicellulose) and galactomannan polymer or glucomannan polymer molecules. The crosslinking agent is applied in an amount of from about 0.1 to about 20% by weight based on the total weight of the carboxyalkyl cellulose and galactomannan or glucomannan polymers. The amount of crosslinking agent applied to the polymers will vary depending on the crosslinking agent. In general, the particles have an aluminum content of about 0.04 to about 2.0% by weight based on the weight of the particles for aluminum crosslinked particles, a titanium content of about 0.1 to about 4.5% by weight based on the weight of the particles for titanium crosslinked particles, a zirconium content of about 0.09 to about 6.0% by weight based on the weight of the particles for zirconium crosslinked particles; and a bismuth content of about 0.09 to about 5.0% by weight based on the weight of the particles for bismuth crosslinked particles.<br>
The gel formed by treating the aqueous solution of a carboxyalkyl cellulose and a galactomannan polymer or glucomannan polymer with the crosslinking agent is then dried to provide a solid that is then comminuted to provide a plurality of particles (superabsorbent particles). In one embodiment, the particles are sieved to obtain particles having a size of from about 150 to about 800 urn. In one embodiment, the particles have a size less than about 800 urn.<br>
The particles are substantially insoluble in water while being capable of absorbing water. The particles are rendered water insoluble by a plurality of non-permanent interpolymer metal crosslinks.<br>
The particles have intermolecular metal crosslinks between polymer molecules. The metal crosslink arises as a consequence of an associative interaction (e.g., bonding) between functional groups on the polymers (e.g., carboxy, carboxylate, or hydroxyl groups) and a multi-valent metal species (see description of crosslinking agents above). Suitable multi-valent metal species include metal ions having a valency of three or greater and that are capable of forming an associative interaction with a polymer (e.g., reactive toward associative interaction with the polymer's carboxy, carboxylate, or hydroxyl groups). The polymers are intermolecularly crosslinked when the multi-valent metal species forms an associative interaction with functional groups on two or more polymer molecules. A crosslink may be formed within one polymer molecule or may be formed between two or more polymer molecules. The extent of crosslinking affects the water solubility of the particles and the ability of the particles to swell on contact with an aqueous liquid.<br>
The superabsorbent particles include non-permanent metal crosslinks formed both intermolecularly and intramolecularly in the population of polymer molecules. As used herein, the term "non-permanent crosslink" refers to the metal crosslink formed with two or more functional groups of a polymer molecule (intramolecularly) or formed with two or more functional groups of two or more polymer molecules (intermolecularly). It will be appreciated that the process of dissociating and re-associating (breaking and reforming crosslinks) the multi-valent metal ion and polymer molecules is dynamic and also occurs during liquid acquisition. During water acquisition the individual particles swell and change to gel state. The ability of non-permanent metal crosslinks to dissociate and associate under water acquisition imparts greater freedom to the gels to expand than if it was restrictively crosslinked by permanent crosslinks that do not have the ability to dissociate and reassociate. Covalent organic crosslinks such as ether crosslinks are permanent crosslinks that do not have the ability to dissociate and reassociate.<br>
The particles are highly absorptive. The particles have a Free Swell Capacity of from about 30 to about 60 g/g (0.9% saline solution), a Centrifuge Retention Capacity<br>
(CRC) of from about 15 to about 35 g/g (0.9% saline solution), and an Absorbency Under Load (AUL) of from about 15 to about 30 g/g (0.9% saline solution).<br>
The particles are water insoluble and water swellable. Water insolubility is imparted by intermolecular crosslinking of the polymer molecules, and water swellability is imparted to the absorbent particles by the presence of carboxylate anions with associated cations. The particles are characterized as having a relatively high liquid absorbent capacity for water (e.g., pure water or aqueous solutions, such as salt solutions or biological solutions such as urine).<br>
The particles are useful as a superabsorbent composition in personal care absorbent products (e.g., infant diapers, feminine care products and adult incontinence products). The particles are useful in a variety of other applications, including, for example, wound dressings, cable wrap, absorbent sheets or bags, and packaging materials.<br>
The preparations of representative superabsorbent particles are described in Examples 1-6. In these examples solutions of a representative carboxyalkyl cellulose and a galactomannan polymer are crosslinked with a metallic crosslinking agent. The composition and liquid absorbent characteristics of representative superabsorbent particles (flakes) are summarized in Table 1. In Table 1, "% wgt total wgt, applied" refers to the amount of crosslinking agent applied to the total weight of CMC and guar gum; "CMC 9H4F" refers to a carboxymethyl cellulose commercially available from Hoechst Celanese under that designation; "PA-CMC" refers to CMC made from northern softwood pulp; "LB Gum" refers to locust bean gum; and "AZC" refers to ammonium zirconium carbonate.<br>
The superabsorbent particles containing carboxyalkyl cellulose can be made by a method that includes the steps of (a) blending a carboxyalkyl cellulose and either a galactomannan polymer or a glucomannan polymer in water to provide an aqueous solution; (b) treating the aqueous solution with a first crosslinking agent to provide a gel; (c) drying the gel to provide a solid; and (d) comminuting the solid to provide a plurality of particles.<br>
In the process, a carboxyalkyl cellulose and either a galactomannan polymer or a glucomannan polymer are blended in water to provide an aqueous solution. In one embodiment, the carboxyalkyl cellulose is carboxymethyl cellulose. The aqueous<br>
solution includes from about 60 to about 99% by weight carboxyalkyl cellulose based on the weight of carboxyalkyl cellulose and galactomannan or glucomannan polymers. In one embodiment, the aqueous solution includes from about 80 to about 95% by weight carboxyalkyl cellulose based on the weight of carboxyalkyl cellulose and galactomannan or glucomannan polymers.<br>
The aqueous solution also includes a galactomannan polymer or a glucomannan polymer. The aqueous solution includes from about 1 to about 20% by weight galactomannan polymer or glucomannan polymer based on the weight of the carboxyalkyl cellulose and galactomannan or glucomannan polymers, and in one embodiment, the aqueous solution includes from about 1 to about 15% by weight galactomannan polymer or glucomannan polymer based on the weight of the carboxyalkyl cellulose and galactomannan or glucomannan polymers.<br>
In the method, the aqueous solution including the carboxyalkyl cellulose and galactomannan polymer or glucomannan polymer is treated with a crosslinking agent to provide a gel. Suitable crosslinking agents are described above. The crosslinking agent is applied in an amount of from about 0.1 to about 20% by weight based on the total weight of the carboxyalkyl cellulose and galactomannan or glucomannan polymers. The amount of crosslinking agent applied to the polymers will vary depending on the crosslinking agent.<br>
The gel formed by treating the aqueous solution of a carboxyalkyl cellulose and a galactomannan polymer or glucomannan polymer with the crosslinking agent is then dried to provide a solid that is then comminuted to provide a plurality of particles (superabsorbent particles). In one embodiment, the particles are sieved to obtain particles having a size of from about 150 to about 800 um. In one embodiment, the particles have a size less than about 800 um.<br>
