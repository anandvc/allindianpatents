				<td>DESCRIPTION FLAVOR AND FRAGRANCE COMPOSITION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The invention relates to a flavor and fragrance composition comprising 1-(2-hydroxy-4-methylcyclohexyl)ethanone, and preferably to a flavor and fragrance composition having a cooling sensation effect comprising 1- (2-hydroxy-4-methylcyclohexyl) -ethanone.  The invention also relates to a beverage or food product, a fragrance or cosmeticproduct, a daily utensil product, an oral composition, or a pharmaceutical product having the flavor and fragrance composition compounded therein, andamethod of producing the same.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
A substance that endows the skin, oral cavity, nose and throat of a person with a cool and refreshing feeling (cooling sensation) , or a so-called cooling sensation agent, is used in various products such as toothpastes, confectioneries such as chewing gums and candies, tobacco, cataplasms, bath agents and cosmetics . L-menthol has been known as a representative cooling sensation agent and is widely used as a flavor and fragrance compound capable of providing a cool and refreshing feeling or a cooling sensation. However the cooling sensation effect thereof does not last so long and when a large amount of 1-menthol is used for imparting the enhanced cooling sensation effect,<br>
it may give a bitter taste.<br>
Many compounds having a cooling sensation effect other than 1-menthol have been conventionally proposed.  Examples of such compounds include 3-substitutedp-menthane (see JP 47-16647 A) , N-substitutedp-menthane-3-carboxamide (seeJP47-16648A) , 1-menthyl glycoside (see JP 48-33069 A), 3-(1-menthoxy)propane-1,2-diol (see JP 58-88334 A), 1-menthyl-3-hydroxybutylate (see JP 61-194049 A), l-alkoxy-3-(1-menthoxy)propane-2-ol (see JP 2-290827 A), esters of 3-hydroxymethyl-p-menthnane (see JP 5-255186 A), methyl N-acetylglycine menthanate (see JP 5-255217 A) , (-)-isopulegol (see JP 6-65023 A), (2S)-3-{(1R,2S,5R-[5-methyl-2-(1-methylethyl)-cyclohexyl]oxy}-l,2-propanediol (see JP 7-82200 A), and 2-hydroxymethyl menthol (see JP 7-118119 A).<br>
On the other hand, it has been reported that<br>
1-(2-hydroxy-4-methylcyclohexyl)ethanone canbe synthesizedby several methods, and that it is important as an intermediate of Pharmaceuticals and a synthetic intermediate of flavor and fragrance products (see US 2003-149299 A) . However, it has not been reported that notes of the flavor and fragrance composition are confirmed with respect to 1-(2-hydroxy-4-methyl-cyclohexyl) ethanone. Therefore any use of it as the flavor and fragrance composition has been unknown. Further it has not been reported any verification of sensory stimulating effects such as cooling effect with respect to 1-(2-hydroxy-4-methylcyclohexyl)ethanone.<br>
DISCROSURE OF INVENTION<br>
Problem to be solved by the Invention<br>
As described above, many compounds having the cooling sensation effect have been proposed. Although these compounds show the cooling sensation effect in their own way, the compounds do not show so satisfactory property with respect to at least any one of the strength of cooling sensation, lasting of the cooling sensation effect, odor, and taste. Accordingly, the flavor and fragrance composition containing these compounds having the cooling sensation effect has also involved the same problem. Conventionally, a warming and/or pungent agent composition having an enhanced warming and/or pungent sensation effect have been obtained by adding the cooling sensation agent to the warming and/or pungent substance composition. In this case also, the flavor and fragrance composition containing the warming and/or pungent agent composition having an excellent warming and/or pungent sensation effect with no malodor and bitter taste originating from the cooling sensation agent is desired.<br>
Accordingly, an object of the invention is to provide a flavor and fragrance composition having no problem described above.  That is, the object of the invention is to provide a flavor and fragrance composition having a strong cooling sensation effect and excellent lasting effect of a cool and refreshing feeling and a cooling sensation without any stimulating sensation, malodor, and bitter taste originating<br>
from the cooling sensation agent when it is used for obtaining the cooling sensation effect. And the object of the invention is also to provide a flavor and fragrance composition not only having a strong cooling sensation effect and excellent lasting effect of a cool and refreshing feeling but also imparting a high flavor and fragrance quality-improving effect to the products, with which the fragrance and flavor composition with properties of enhanced emission of fragrance and excellent remaining fragrance, is compounded.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a beverage or food product, a fragrance or cosmetic product, a daily utensil product, an oral composition, or a pharmaceutical product with an excellent cool and refreshing feeling effect, cooling sensation effect and lasting effect thereof and further given a flavor and fragrance quality-improved effect by compounding with the flavor and fragrance composition, and to provide amethod of producing the products.<br>
A different obj ect of the invention is to provide a flavor and fragrance composition having an enhanced warming and/or pungent sensation effect by addition of cooling sensation agent, and further to provide a flavor and fragrance composition having an enhanced warming and/or pungent sensation effect and improved emission and remaining of flavor and fragrance.<br>
A further different object of the invention is to provide a flavor and fragrance composition having an improved warming and/or pungent sensation effect and further being able to impart a high flavor and fragrance quality-improving effect to various<br>
products by adding the flavor and fragrance composition thereto.<br>
A further different object of the invention is to provide a beverage or food product, a fragrance or cosmetic product, a daily utensil product, an oral composition, or a pharmaceutical product to which a high flavor and fragrance quality-improved effect is imparted by compounding with the flavor and fragrance composition having an improved warming and/or pungent sensation effect, and to provide a method of producing the products.<br>
An object of the invention according to a different point of view of the invention is, in addition to the objects described above, toprovide a cooling sensationagent composition excellent in strength of a cool and refreshing feeling and a cooling sensation with a good lasting property without any stimulating sensation, malodor and bitter taste, to provide a warming and/or pungent substance composition having an enhanced warming and/or pungent sensation effect by adding the cooling sensation agent composition, and toprovide a sensory stimulant agent composition having compounded therein the cooling sensation agent composition or warming and/or pungent agent composition.<br>
Means for solving Problem<br>
The inventors have made intensive studies on the cooling sensation effect of various compounds derived from 1-menthol and related compounds for solving the problems as described above . As a result, the inventors have found that<br>
1-(2-hydroxy-4-methylcyclohexyl)ethanone represented by the following formula (1) has a strong cooling sensation effect with<br>
a good lasting property and without any problems of a stimulating sensation, malodor and bitter taste, therefore the compound is useful as a cooling sensation agent.  The inventors have also found that 1-(2-hydroxy-4-methylcyclohexyl)ethanone can moderate the stimulating odor inherent in 1-menthol when 1-menthol is used as a cooling sensation substance, the cooling sensation effect can be enhanced by combining it with other cooling sensation substances except 1-menthol, and the warming and /or pungent sensation effect can be improved by adding it to a warming and/or pungent substance.  It has also been found that a cooling sensation effect excellent in the lastingproperty, emission of fragrance and remaining of fragrance are imparted to a flavor and fragrance composition by addition of 1-(2-hydroxy-4-methylcyclohexyl)ethanone and further a high flavor and fragrance quality-improving effect is imparted to various products flavored and fragrance-added with the flavor and fragrance composition.

The proportion of use of the cooling sensation agent composition in the invention may be in the range wherein the cooling sensation effect is not imparted to the warming and/or pungent substance composition compounded with the cooling sensation agent when the object of adding the cooling sensation agent composition is to enhance the warming and/or pungent sensation effect.  The amount of the cooling sensation agent compounded is usually from 0.001 to 0.95 times, preferably from 0.01 to 0.5 times, of the total amount of the warming and/or pungent substance.<br>
The flavor and fragrance composition of the invention is featured in containing 1-(2-hydroxy-4-methylcyclohexyl)-ethanone, and the composition may include any compositions or may be produced by any compounding methods so long as it contains 1-(2-hydroxy-4-methylcyclohexyl)ethanone.  For example, the flavor and fragrance composition comprising<br>
1-(2-hydroxy-4-methylcyclohexyl)ethanone may be prepared by being directly mixed with other components for forming the flavor and fragrance composition, or by preparing a cooling sensation agent composition containing 1-(2-hydroxy-4-methylcyclohexyl)ethanone as a constituent,<br>
followed by mixing the composition with other components for forming the flavor and fragrance composition.  Otherwise, the flavor and fragrance compositionmay be formulated into a warming and/or pungent substance composition or sensory stimulant composition first, followedby mixing the composition with other components for forming the flavor and fragrance composition. Alternatively, a base flavor and fragrance composition is prepared in advance by mixing flavor and fragrance components, and then the cooling sensation agent composition consisting of 1-(2-hydroxy-4-methylcyclohexyl)ethanone, or cooling sensation agent composition, warming and/or pungent substance composition or sensory stimulant composition containing 1- ( 2-hydroxy-4-methylcyclohexyl) ethanone may be compounded in the base flavor and fragrance composition prepared in advance as described above.<br>
