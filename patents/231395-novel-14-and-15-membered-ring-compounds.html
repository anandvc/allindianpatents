				<td>NOVEL 14 AMD 15 MEMBERED-RING COMPOUNDS<br>
The present Invention relates to novel semt-synthetic macrolides having antimicrobial<br>
activity, in particular antibacterial activity. More particularly, the invention relates to 14-<br>
and 15-membered macrolldes substituted at the 4" position, to processes for their<br>
preparation, to compositions containing them and to their use in medicine.<br>
Macrolide antibacterial agents are known to be useful in the treatment or prevention of<br>
bacterial infections. However, the emergence of macrolide-reslstant bacterial strains has"<br>
resulted in the need to develop new macrolide compounds. For example, EP 0 895 999<br>
describes derivatives modified at the 4" position of the macrolide ring having antibacterial<br>
activity.<br>
According to the present invention, we have now found novel 14- and 15-membered<br>
macrolldes substituted at the 4" position which also have antimicrobial activity.<br>

and pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof.<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable" as used herein means a compound which Is<br>
suitable for pharmaceutical use. Salts and solvates of compounds of the invention which<br>
are suitable for use in medicine are those wherein the counterion or associated solvent<br>
is pharmaceutically acceptable. However, salts and solvates having non-<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable counterforts or associated solvents are within the scope of<br>
the present invention, for example, for use as Intermediates in the preparation of other<br>
compounds of the Invention and their pharmaceutJcally acceptable salts and solvates.<br><br>
Compounds of the Invention may have both a basic and an acidic centre may therefore<br>
be inihe form of zwitterions.<br>
Those skilled in the art of organic chemistry will appreciate that many organic<br>
compounds can form complexes with solvents in which they are reacted or from which<br>
they are precipitated or crystallized. These complexes are known as "solvates". For<br>
example, a complex with water Is known as a "hydrate". Solvates of the compound of<br>
the invention are within the scope of the invention. The salts of the compound of formula<br>
(I) may form solvates (e.g. hydrates) and the Invention also includes all such solvates.<br>
The term "prodrug" as used herein means a compound which is converted within the<br>
body, e.g. by hydrolysis in the blood, into its active form that has medical effects.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs are described in T. Higuchi and V. Stella,<br>
"Prodrugs as Novel Delivery Systems", Vol. 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series, Edward<br>
B. Roche, ed., "Bioreverslble Carriers in Drug Design", American Pharmaceutical<br>
Association and Pergamon Press, 1987, and in D. Fleisher, S. Ramon and H. Barbra<br>
"Improved oral drug delivery: solubility limitations overcome by the use of prodrugs",<br>
Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews (1996) 19(2) 115-130, each of which are incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
Prodrugs are any covalentty bonded carriers that release a compound of structure (\) In<br>
vivo when such prodrug is administered to a patient Prodrugs are generally prepared by<br>
modifying functional groups in a way such that the modification is cleaved, either by<br>
routine manipulation or In vivo, yielding the parent compound. Prodrugs include, for<br>
example, compounds of this invention wherein hydroxy, amine or sulfhydryl groups are<br>
bonded to any group that, when administered to a patient, cleaves to form the hydroxy,<br>
amine or sulfhydryi groups. Thus, representative examples of prodrugs Include (but are<br>
not limited to) acetate, formate and benzoate derivatives of alcohol, sulfhydryi and amine<br>
functional groups of the compounds of structure (I). Further, in the case of a carboxylic<br>
acid (-COOH), esters may be employed, such as methyl esters, ethyl esters, and the<br>
like. Esters may be active in their own right and/or be hydrolysable under In vivo<br>
conditions in the human body. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable In vivo hydrolysable<br>
ester groups include those which break down readily in the human body to leave the<br>
parent acid or its salt<br>
References hereinafter to a compound according to the invention include both compounds<br>
of formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives.<br>
With regard to stereoisomers, the compounds of structure (I) have more than one<br>
asymmetric carbon atom. In the general formula (I) as drawn, the solid wedge shaped<br><br>
The term "pharmaceutlcally acceptable derivative" as used herein means any<br>
pharmaceutlcally acceptable salt, solvate or prodrug, e.g. ester, of a compound of the<br>
invention, which upon administration to the recipient is capable of providing (directly or<br>
indirectly) a compound of the Invention, or an active metabolite or residue thereof. Such<br>
 derivatives are recognizable to those skilled In the art, without undue experimentation.<br>
Nevertheless, reference is made to the teaching of Burger's Medicinal Chemistry and<br>
Drug Discovery, 5th Edition, Vol 1: Principles and Practice, which is incorporated herein<br>
by reference to the extent of teaching such derivatives. Preferred pharmaceutlcally<br>
acceptable derivatives are salts, solvates, esters, carbamates and phosphate esters.<br>
Particularly preferred pharmaceutlcally acceptable derivatives are salts, solvates and<br>
esters. Most preferred pharmaceutlcally acceptable derivatives are salts and esters, In<br>
particular salts.<br>
The compounds of the present Invention may be in the form of and/or may be<br>
administered as a pharmaceutlcally acceptable salt. For a review on suitable salts see<br>
Berge et al., J. Pharm. Scl., 1977,66,1-19.<br>
Typically, a pharmaceutical acceptable salt may be readily prepared by using a desired<br>
acid or base as appropriate. The salt may precipitate from solution and be collected by<br>
filtration or may be recovered by evaporation of the solvent. For example, an aqueous<br>
solution of an acid such as hydrochloric acid may be added to an aqueous suspension of<br>
a compound of formula (I) and the resulting mixture evaporated to dryness (lyophlllsed)<br>
to obtain the acid addition salt as a solid. Alternatively, a compound of formula (I) may<br>
be dissolved in a suitable solvent, for example an alcohol such as Isopropanol, and the<br>
acid may be added in the same solvent or another suitable solvent The resulting acid<br>
addition salt may then be precipitated directly, or by addition of a less polar solvent such<br>
as dllsopropyl ether or hexane, and Isolated by filtration.<br>
Suitable addition salts are formed from Inorganic or organic acids which form non-toxic<br>
salts and examples are hydrochloride, hydrobromlde, hydroiodide, sulphate, bisulphate,<br>
nitrate, phosphate, hydrogen phosphate, acetate, trlfluoroacetate, maleate, malate,<br>
fumarate, lactate, tartrate, citrate, formate, gluconate, succinate, pyruvate, oxalate,<br>
oxaloacetate, trlfluoroacetate, saccharate, benzoate, alkyl or aryl sulphonates (eg<br>
methanesulphonate, ethanesulphonate, benzenesulphonate or p-toluenesulphonate)<br>
and isethlonate. Representative examples include trlfluoroacetate and formate salts, for<br>
example the bis or tris trlfluoroacetate salts and the mono or dlformate salts.<br>
Pharmaceutlcally acceptable base salts Include ammonium salts, alkali metal salts such<br>
as those of sodium and potassium, alkaline earth metal salts such as those of calcium<br>
and magnesium and salts with organic bases, Including salts of primary, secondary and<br>
tertiary amines, such as Isopropylamine, diethylamine, ethanolamine, trimethylamine,<br>
dicyclohexyl amine and N-methyl-D-glucamlne.<br><br>
bond indicates that the bond is above the plane of the paper. The broken bond indicates<br>
that the bond is below the plane of the paper.<br>
It will be appreciated that the substltuents on the macrollde may also have one or more<br>
asymmetric carbon atoms. Thus, the compounds of structure (I) may occur as individual<br>
enantiomers or dlastereomers. All such isomeric forms are included within the present<br>
invention, including mixtures thereof.<br>
Where a compound of the invention contains an alkenyl group, cls (Z) and trans (E)<br>
isomerism may also occur. The present invention includes the Individual stereoisomers<br>
of the compound of the invention and, where appropriate, the individual tautomeric forms<br>
thereof, together with mixtures thereof.<br>
Separation of diastereoisomers or cis and trans isomers may be achieved by<br>

inclusion complexes with drug molecules. Formation of a drug-cyclodextrin complex may<br>
modify the solubility, dissolution rate, bioavailability and/or stability property of a drug<br>
molecule. Drug-cyclodextrln complexes are generally useful for most dosage forms and<br>
administration routes. As an alternative to direct complexation with the drug the<br>
cyclodextrin may be used as an auxiliary additive, e. g. as a carrier, diluent or solublliser.<br>
Alpha-, beta- and gamma-cyclodextrins are most commonly used and suitable examples<br>
are described in WO 91/11172, WO 94/02518 and WO 98/55148.<br>
The compounds of the Invention may be milled using known milling procedures such as<br>
wet milling to obtain a particle size appropriate for tablet formation and for other<br>
formulation types. Finely divided (nanoparticulate) preparations of the compounds of the<br>
invention may be prepared by processes known In the art, for example see International<br>
Patent Application No. WO 02/00196 (SmithKline Beecham).<br>
The routes for administration (delivery) include, but are not limited to, one or more of:<br>
oral (e. g. as a tablet, capsule, or as an ingestable solution), topical, mucosal (e. g. as a<br><br>
nasal spray or aerosol for inhalation), nasal, parenteral (e. g. by an injectable form),<br>
gastrointestinal, intraspinal, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, Intravenous, intrauterine,<br>
intraocular, intradermal, Intracranial, intratracheal, intravaginal, intracerebroventricular,<br>
intracerebral, subcutaneous, ophthalmic (including intravitreal or intracameral),<br>
transdermal, rectal, buccal, epidural and sublingual.<br>
There may be different composition/formulation requirements depending on the different<br>
delivery systems. By way of example, the pharmaceutical composition of the present<br>
invention may be formulated to be delivered using a mini-pump or by a mucosal route,<br>
for example, as a nasal spray or aerosol for inhalation or ingestable solution, or<br>
parenterally in which the composition is formulated by an injectable form, for delivery, by,<br>
for example, an intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous route. Alternatively, the<br>
formulation may be designed to be delivered by both routes.<br>
Where the agent is to be delivered mucosally through the gastrointestinal mucosa, It<br>

agents. The Invention thus provides, in a further aspect, a combination comprising a<br>
compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof together<br>
with a further therapeutic agent<br>
When a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof<br>
is used in combination with a second therapeutic agent active against the same disease<br>
state the dose of each compound may differ from that when the compound is used<br>
alone. Appropriate doses will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art It will be<br>
appreciated that the amount of a compound of the Invention required for use In treatment<br>
will vary with the nature of the condition being treated and the age and the condition of<br>
the patient and will be ultimately at the discretion of the attendant physician or<br>
veterinarian. The compounds of the present invention may for example be used for<br>
topical administration with other active ingredients such as corticosteroids or antifungals<br>
as appropriate.<br>
The combinations referred to above may conveniently be presented for use in the form<br>
of a pharmaceutical formulation and thus pharmaceutical formulations comprising a<br><br>
combination as defined above together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or<br>
excipient comprise a further aspect of the invention. The individual components of such<br>
combinations may be administered either sequentially or simultaneously in separate or<br>
combined pharmaceutical formulations by any convenient route.<br>
When administration is sequential, either the compound of the invention or the second<br>
therapeutic agent may be administered first When administration is simultaneous, the<br>
combination may be administered either in the same or different pharmaceutical<br>
composition.<br>
When combined in the same formulation it will be appreciated that the two compounds<br>
must be stable and compatible with each other and the other components of the<br>
formulation. When formulated separately they may be provided in any convenient<br>
formulation, conveniently in such manner as are known for such compounds in the art.<br>
The compositions may contain from 0.01-99% of the active material. For topical<br>
administration, for example, the composition will generally contain from 0.01-10%, more<br>
preferably 0.01-1% of the active material.<br>
Typically, a physician will determine the actual dosage which will be most suitable for an<br>
individual subject. The specific dose level and frequency of dosage for any particular<br>
individual may be varied and will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of<br>
the specific compound employed, the metabolic stability and length of action of that<br>
compound, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, mode and time of<br>
administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity of the particular condition,<br>
and the individual undergoing therapy.<br>
For oral and parenteral administration to humans, the daily dosage level of the agent may<br>
be in single or divided doses.<br>
For systemic administration the daily dose as employed for adult human treatment it will<br>
range from 2-100mg/kg body weight, preferably 5-60mg/kg body weight, which may be<br>
administered in 1 to 4 daily doses, for example, depending on the route of administration<br>
and the condition of the patient. When the composition comprises dosage units, each unit<br>
will preferably contain 200mg to 1g of active ingredient. The duration of treatment will be<br>
dictated by the rate of response rather than by arbitrary numbers of days..<br>

methods outlined hereinafter, said methods constituting a further aspect of the invention.<br>
In the following description, the groups R1 to R33, A, B, X, Y, U, W, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, m,<br>
n, p, q, r, s, t, v, w and z have the meaning defined for the compounds of formula (I)<br>
unless otherwise stated.<br><br>
The groups R11a, BaR11a and XaR11a are R11, BR11 and XR11 as defined for formula<br>
(I) or groups convertible to R11, BR11 and XR11. Conversion of such groups typically<br>
arises if a protecting group is needed during the reactions described below. A<br>
comprehensive discussion of the ways in which such groups may be protected and<br>
methods for cleaving the resulting protected derivatives is given by for example T.W.<br>
Greene and P.G.M Wuts in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis 2nd ed., John Wiley &amp;<br>
Son, Inc 1991 and by P.J. Koclenskl In Protecting Groups, Georg Thieme Verlag 1994<br>
which are incorporated herein by reference. Examples of suitable amino protecting groups<br>
include acyl type protecting groups (e.g. formyl, trifiuoroacetyl and acetyl), aromatic<br>
urethane type protecting groups (e.g. benzyioxycarbonyl (Cbz) and substituted Cbz, and<br>
9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc)), aliphatic urethane protecting groups (e.g. t-<br>
butyloxycarbonyl (Boc), isopropyloxycarbonyl and cyclohexyloxycarbonyl) and alkyl type<br>
protecting groups (e.g. benzyl, trityl and chlorotrityl). Examples of suitable oxygen<br>
protecting groups may include for example alkyl silyl groups, such as trimethylsllyl or tert-<br>
butyldimethylsllyl; alkyl ethers such as tetrahydropyranyl or tert-butyl; or esters such as<br>
acetate. Hydroxy groups may be protected by reaction of for example acetic anhydride,<br>
benzoic anhydride or a trialkylsllyl chloride in an aprotlc solvent. Examples of aprotic<br>
solvents are dichioromethane, N,N-dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, tetrahydrofuran<br>
and the like.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) wherein U is -N(R30)- may be prepared by reaction of a 4"<br>
aldehyde compound of formula (II) wherein A, R2, R3, R4 and R5 may be suitably<br>
protected, for example by cyclic protection between the 9 and 12 positions when A is -<br>
C(O)- and d is an integer from 1 to 5, with a suitable protected derivative of the amine<br>
(Illa) or (lllb), followed where necessary by subsequent removal of the hydroxyl protecting<br>
group R2 and conversion of the BaR11a or R11a group to BR11 orR11.<br><br><br><br>

and DMF. A suitable reducing agent is, for example, sodium cyanoborohydride.<br>
Compounds of formula (II) where d' is 1 or 2 may be prepared from suitably protected<br>
compounds of formula (IV) by hydroboration with 9-BBN, or other suitable boranes,<br>
followed by treatment with peroxide and then oxidation (d' = 2), or by osmlum<br>
tetroxide/peridoate cleavage (d' = 1). Compounds of formula (IV) can be formed by<br>
palladium-catalysed allylation of suitably protected 4" hydroxy compounds.<br><br>
In another embodiment of the invention, compounds of formula (I) wherein U is a group<br>
selected from -N(R30)- and -S-, may be prepared by reaction of compounds of formula (V)<br><br><br>
wherein d is an integer from 2 to 6 and L is a suitable leaving group, with XaR11a (VI) in<br>
which U is a group selected from -N(R30)- and -S-. The reaction is preferably carried out<br>
in a solvent such as a halohydrocarbon (e.g. dichloromethane), an ether (e.g.<br>
tetrahydrofuran or dimethoxyethane), acetonitrile or ethyl acetate and the like,<br>
dimethyisulfoxide, N.N-dimethylformamlde or 1-methyl-pyrrolidone and in the presence of<br>
a base, followed, if desired, by removal of the hydroxyl protecting group R2 and<br>
conversion of the XaR11a group to XR11. Examples of the bases which may be used<br>
include organic bases such as diisopropylethylamine, triethylamine and 1,8-<br>
dlazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU), and inorganic bases such as potassium hydroxide,<br>
cesium hydroxide, tetraalkylammonium hydroxide, sodium hydride, potassium hydride and<br>
the like. Suitable leaving groups for this reaction Include hallde (e.g. chloride, bromide or<br>
iodide) or a sulfonyloxy group (e.g. tosyloxy or methanesulfonyloxy).<br>
Compounds of formula (I) may be converted into other compounds of formula (I). Thus<br>
compounds of formula (I) wherein U or B is -S(O)z- and z Is 1 or 2 may be prepared by<br>
oxidation of the corresponding compound of formula (I) wherein z is 0. The oxidation is<br>
preferably carried out using a peracid, e.g. peroxybenzoic acid, followed by treatment with<br>
a phosphine, such as triphenylphosphine. The reaction is suitably carried out in an organic<br>
solvent such as methylene chloride. Compounds of formula (I) wherein U or B is -N(R30)-<br>
and R30 is C1-4alkyl can be prepared from compounds wherein R30 is hydrogen by<br>

This method was adapted from the work of Debono et al. (J. Antlbfot. 1989, 42,1253-<br>
1267). A solution of intermediate 15 (955.9 mg, 1.17 mmoL), intermediate 1 (563.1 mg,<br>
1.75 mmoL), and 22.5 mL of EtOAc was heated to 70'C with stirring. Formic acid (58.9<br>
mg, 1.28 mmoL) was added dropwise to the solution, and the temperature was lowered to<br>
65Â°C. Stirring and heating was continued for 5 h. After cooling to room temperature, the<br>
reaction solution was washed twice with 25 mL portions of saturated aqueous NaHCO3<br>
and then once with 20 mL of saturated aqueous NaCI. The combined extracts were dried<br>
over anhydrous MgS04, filtered, and evaporated under reduced pressure to furnish crude<br>
product as a yellow foam. This material was taken up in 100 mL of hot Et20; insolubles<br>
were filtered and saved. The filtrate was treated with 30 mL of hot hexane, and again the<br>
resulting insoluble matter was filtered and saved. The filtrate was concentrated to about<br>
7.5 mL by boiling off excess solvent The resulting solution was allowed to cool to room<br>
temperature and then cooled to 5Â°C for several hours. A colorless precipitate formed<br>
(630.6 mg). The filtrate was combined with the insolubies that were saved, and the<br>
mixture was then chromatographed on silica gel. Elutlon with 9:1 CH2CI2-MeOH<br>
