Technical Field<br>
[1]	The present invention relates generally to point-to-multipoint service in a wireless<br>
communication system and, more particularly, to terminal distribution control for<br>
point-to-multipoint service.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2]	The "UMTS (universal mobile telecommunications system) is a third generation<br>
mobile communications system evolved from the European GSM (Global System for<br>
Mobile Communications) system and aims to provide improved mobile com-<br>
munication services based on a GSM core network and a wideband code division .<br>
multiple access (W-CDMA) technology.<br>
[3]	Figure 1 is a block diagram illustrating a structure of a UMTS network.<br>
[4]	Referring to Figure 1, the UMTS system generally consists of a terminal (e.g., user<br>
equipment (UE)), a UTRAN (UTMS radio access network) and a GN (core network).<br>
The UTRAN includes one or more RNSs (radio network sub-systems). Each RNS<br>
includes a single RNC (radio network controller) and one or more base stations (e.g.,<br>
node-Bs) managed by the RNC. Each Node B managed by the RNC receives in-<br>
formation sent from a physical layer of a terminal on the uplink, and transmits data to<br>
the terminal on the downlink. Thus, the node-B serves as an access point to the<br>
UTRAN for the terminal. The RNC allocates and manages radio resources, and serves<br>
as an access point to the CN for the UTRAN.<br>
[5]	Figure 2 is a diagram illustrating a connection structure between a UTRAN and a<br>
terminal in a UMTS network. As such, Figure 2 shows an exemplary architecture of<br>
radio interface protocols between a terminal and a UTRAN based on a 3GPP radio<br>
access network specification.<br>
[6]	Referring to Figure 2, the radio protocol is horizontally arranged to include a<br>
physical layer, a data link layer and a network layer. The radio protocol is vertically<br>
divided into a user plane for transmitting data information and a control plane for<br>
transferring control signals. Furthermore, the protocol layers shown in Figure 2 may be<br>
divided into a first layer L1, a second layer L2 and a third layer L3, based upon the •<br>
three lower layers of an open system interconnection (OSI) specification model that is<br>
well-known in the art of communications systems.<br>
[7]	The first layer L1 (e.g., the physical layer) uses physical channels to provide in-<br><br>
formation transfer service to its upper layers. The physical layer is connected via a<br>
transport channel to a medium access control (MAC) layer located at an upper layer<br>
thereof. Data between the medium access control layer and the physical layer is<br>
transferred via this transport channel. Furthermore, the data between different physical<br>
layers, i.e. between physical layers of transmitting side and receiving side, is<br>
transferred via the physical layer.<br>
[8]	The MAC layer of the second layer L2 provides services to an upper radio link<br>
control (RLC) layer via a logical channel. The RLC layer of the L2 supports reliable<br>
data transmissions and performs segmentation and concatenation of RLC SDUs<br>
(service data units).<br>
[9]	The RRC (Radio Resource Control) layer positioned in the lowest portion of the<br>
third layer (L3) is defined in the control plane and controls the transport channels and<br>
the physical channels for establishment, reconfiguration, and release of radio bearers<br>
(RBs). The RB indicates a service by the L2 for a data transfer between the terminal<br>
and the UTRAN. In general, establishing the RB denotes processes of stipulating the<br>
characteristics of a protocol layer and a channel, which are required for providing a<br>
specific service, and setting corresponding parameters and operation methods.<br>
[ 10]	When the RRC layer of a specific terminal and the RRC layer of the UTRAN are<br>
connected to each other to exchange RRC messages, the corresponding terminal is in a<br>
RRC connected state. On the contrary, when not connected to each other, the cor-<br>
responding terminal is in an idle state. The terminal in the RRC connected state is<br>
further divided into URA_PCH state and CELL_PCH state, CELLJFACH state and<br>
CELLJDCH state. Terrninals in the idle state or the URA_PCH state and CELLJPCH<br>
state use a discontinuous reception (DRX) method to reduce power consumption,<br>
thereby discontinuously receiving a physical channel (i.e., SCCPCH (secondary<br>
common control physical channel)) to which a physical channel (i.e., PICH (paging<br>
indicator channel)) and a transport channel (i.e., PCH (paging channel)) are mapped.<br>
The terminal is in a sleeping mode during the remaining time periods excluding those<br>
times when receiving the PICH or the SCCPCH. The terminal performing the DRX<br>
method wakes up once per DRX cycle length to receive a PI (paging indicator) of the<br>
PICH channel.<br>
[11]	The terminal in the RRC connected state may further have a signaling connection<br>
with the CN. In this case, the signaling connection indicates a path for exchanging<br>
control messages between the terminal and the CN. The RRC connected state denotes a<br>
connection between the terminal the UTRAN, while the signaling connection denotes a<br>
connection between the terminal and the CN. The terminal uses the signaling<br>
connection to inform the CN of its position and/or to request services. The terminal<br>
should be in the RRC connected state to have a signaling connection.<br><br>
[12]	A MBMS (multimedia broadcast / multicast service) is described below.<br>
[13]	The MBMS refers to a service for providing streaming or background services to a<br>
 plurality of terminals using a downlink dedicated MBMS bearer service. In the<br>
UTRAN, the MBMS bearer uses a point-to-multipoisit radio bearer (RB) and a point-<br>
to-point RB. At this time, the point-to-multipoint RB uses a common channel (e.g.,<br>
using the SCCPCH as a physical layer) so that a plurality of terminals subscribed to a<br>
corresponding service may receive the service.<br>
[14]	The MBMS is divided into a broadcast mode and a multicast mode. The MBMS<br>
broadcast mode is a service for transmitting multimedia data to all users within a<br>
broadcast area. Conversely, the MBMS multicast mode is a service for transmitting the<br>
multimedia data only to a specific user group within a multicast area. The broadcast<br>
area refers to a region in which it is possible to transmit the broadcast service, and the<br>
multicast area refers to a region in which it is possible to transmit the multicast service.<br>
[15]	Figure 3 is a diagram illustrating an example of the UMTS network providing a<br>
point-to-multipoint service to the terminal.<br>
[16]	Referring to Figure 3, a UE1 performs a subscribing process in order to receive an<br>
MBMS service. The UE1 also receives a service announcement provided by the<br>
network regarding the MBMS service. Subscribing refers to the establishment of a re-<br>
lationship between a service provider and a user. A service announcement refers to<br>
providing the terminal an index and other information related to the services to be<br>
provided. For example, a terminal that desires to receive the MBMS service of a<br>
multicast mode should join a multicast group. The multicast group refers to a group of<br>
terminals receiving a specific multicast service. Joining refers to a user merging with<br>
other users in a multicast group to receive a particular multicast service. The terminal<br>
may inform the UMTS network that it desires to receive specific multicast data<br>
through MBMS multicast joining. On the contrary, leaving is a procedure in which a<br>
terminal that joined a specific multicast group releases its joining to the multicast<br>
group. Each terminal performs such subscribing, joining and leaving processes. The<br>
terminal may perform the subscribing, joining, and leaving processes any time of<br>
before, during, or after data transmission.<br>
[17]	During performance of a specific MBMS service, one or more sessions may se-<br>
quentially be generated with respect to the MBMS service. If data to be transmitted for<br>
the specific MBMS service is generated in a MBMS service source, the CN notifies a<br>
session start to the RNC. However, if there is no data to be transmitted for the specific<br>
MBMS service in the MBMS service source, the CN notifies a session end to the RNC.<br>
The data transmission with respect to the specific MBMS service may be carried out<br>
between the session start and the session end. At this time, the data transmitted through<br>
the data transmission process is transmitted only to terminals that have joined the<br><br>
multicast group.<br>
[18]	In the session start process, the UTRAN receives the session start notification from<br>
the CN and transfers a MBMS notification to the tenninals. The MBMS notification<br>
refers to the UTRAN informing a terminal that the data transmission of the specific<br>
MBMS service in a cell is imminent. The MBMS notification may be transmitted<br>
multiple times before the transmission of the data pertaining to the service. When<br>
carrying out the MBMS notification process, the UTRAN may also count the number<br>
of terminals receiving the specific MBMS service within a cell. The counting may be<br>
used for determining whether a point-to-multipomt KB or a point-to-point RB is set as<br>
the RB for transmitting the specific MBMS service data, or whether no RB is set.<br>
[19]	The UTRAN internally establishes a threshold value to select an appropriate<br>
MBMS RB. After the UTRAN counts the number of terminals, if the counted number<br>
of terminals receiving the corresponding MBMS service within the corresponding cell<br>
is smaller than the threshold value, the UTRAN establishes a point-to-point RB.<br>
However, a point-to-multipoint RB is established if the counted number of terminals is<br>
greater than the threshold value. After determining the MBMS RB, the UTRAN<br>
informs the terminals of the establishment information of the corresponding RB.<br>
[20]	When the point-to-point RB is established for the specific service, the terminals<br>
that desire to receive the service must be in the RRC connected mode state. However,<br>
when the point-to-multipoint RB is established for the specific service, the terminals<br>
that desire to receive the service do not have to be in the RRC connected mode state.<br>
That is, terminals in an idle state may also receive the MBMS service data by using the<br>
point-to-multipoint RB. However, if no terminals are counted, the UTRAN does not<br>
establish any RB and does not transmit the MBMS service data. As such, the UTRAN<br>
establishing an RB when there is no user who wants to receive the service may cause<br>
undesirable consumption of radio resources. The UTRAN initiates a transmission for<br>
MBMS service data received from the CN during a session using the determined RB.<br>
[21]	During the counting process, the UTRAN does not have any information pertaining<br>
to terminals in an RRC idle mode. Accordingly, when the terminals in the RRC idle<br>
mode are requested by the UTRAN for counting (with respect to MBMS services<br>
subscribed by the terminals), the terminals in the RRC idle mode implement an RRC<br>
connection with the UTRAN. As a result, the terminals notify the UTRAN that the<br>
terminals in the RRC idle mode want to receive the specific MBMS service.<br>
[22]	However, when the terminals have a signaling connection with the SGSN (serving<br>
general packet radio service support node), the SGSN informs the UTRAN of in-<br>
formation related to the MBMS of the terminals. The information includes a list of<br>
MBMS services subscribed to by the terminals. Therefore, the UTRAN may recognize<br>
whether the terminals have subscribed to a specific MBMS service. Accordingly, the<br><br>
terminals do not respond to the request for the counting from the UTRAN. Terminals<br>
which do not have the signaling connection with the SGSN but are in the RRC<br>
connected state may inform the UTRAN of the list of MBMS services subscribed to by<br>
the terminals. Hence, the UTRAN may recognize the number of terminals desiring to<br>
receive the specific MBMS service without receiving any response from the terminals<br>
in the RRC connected state.<br>
[23]	The UTRAN may perform the counting process during a session of the MBMS<br>
service or in the initial step of the MBMS service. Tliis is because, during the MBMS<br>
session, the terminal may move into another cell, turn off its power, or discontinue use<br>
of the MBMS service. Therefore, the number of terminals desiring to receive the<br>
MBMS service in a cell may change. Thus, the UTRAN may perform the counting<br>
process to establish the RB more efficiently even while the MBMS session is ongoing.<br>
[24]	A FLC (Frequency Layer Convergence) is described below.<br>
[25]	In the UMTS system, a base station may actually use one or more frequency<br>
bandwidths. That is, because all users may not receive services with appropriate<br>
qualities using only one frequency bandwidth in an area where many users are<br>
congregated (e.g., in a hot-spot), service providers consider the service demand in a<br>
region where the base station is positioned in order to provide services by using more<br>
than one frequency bandwidth.<br>
[26]	When one base station uses several frequencies, for example several adjacent<br>
frequencies, the propagation characteristics of radio waves in each frequency have<br>
many similarities. If one MBMS service is provided using a power level corresponding<br>
to approximately ten percent of the entire power available for a specific frequency in a<br>
specific cell, when the base station provides the same MBMS service at other<br>
frequencies, significant radio resources may be consumed.<br>
[27]	Therefore, when a base station uses several frequencies, the base station selects one<br>
frequency among the available frequencies to provide the MBMS service. The<br>
terminals then move to the selected frequency. The preceding operations are referred to<br>
as FLC (Frequency Layer Convergence). The specific: frequency selected by the base<br>
station to provide the MBMS service is referred to as a preferred frequency.<br>
[28]	In FLC, when notifying terminals of a MBMS start, the base station informs the<br>
terminals of the preferred frequency on which the MBMS service is provided to induce<br>
the terminals to move to the specific frequency. To this end, the base station informs<br>
the terminals positioned at frequencies other than the preferred frequency that the<br>
MBMS service is provided only at the preferred frequency. Then, the terminals carry<br>
out a cell reselection procedure. When a condition for changing a cell is satisfied, the<br>
terminals reselect a cell to move to the preferred frequency.<br>
[29]	The cell reselection by the terminals is described below.<br><br>
[30]	The cell reselection process is a process for positioning a terminal in a cell that<br>
provides services of at least a minimum quality. In this process, the terminal compares<br>
■ the quality of a serving cell against the quality of a neighboring cell. If the quality of<br>
the neighboring cell is superior to that of the serving cell, the terminal reestablishes the<br>
neighboring cell as its serving cell.<br>
[31]	Cell quality may be influenced by radio wave environment, which may change in<br>
an irregular manner. As a result, a terminal located at a boundary of more than two<br>
cells frequently performs cell reselection in an alternating fashion (e.g., selecting<br>
different cells in turn). Whenever cell reselection is performed, the terminal must re-<br>
register its location with a new cell or temporarily stop data transmissions. Ac-<br>
cordingly, cell reselection should not be performed more frequently than necessary, to<br>
prevent waste of resources. Accordingly, when the quality of the serving cell is higher<br>
than a specific reference value, the terminal does not perform cell reselection. The<br>
specific reference value is set at a value by which services may be provided at a sat-<br>
isfactory level to the terminal. That is, even if the serving cell does not provide better<br>
quality than neighboring cells, if the quality of the serving cell is higher than the<br>
specific reference, then the terminal does not perform cell reselection.<br>
[32]	When a base station uses several frequencies, each frequency may be for a<br>
particular cell, and the cell reselection is used in Cell_PCH, Cell_FACH, URA_PCH<br>
and idle mode in which the UTRAN does not assign a cell where the terminal should<br>
be positioned.<br>
[33]	FLC is described in relationship with cell reselection, below. When a frequency in<br>
a cell in which a terminal is positioned is not a preferred frequency, the terminal<br>
receives information regarding the preferred frequency from a base station at an initial<br>
step of the MBMS service. However, as described above, if the quality of the cell in<br>
which the terminal is positioned exceeds a specific reference value, the terminal does<br>
not perform the cell reselection process. Because the MBMS service subscribed by the<br>
terminal is provided only at the preferred frequency, if the terminal does not move to<br>
the preferred frequency, the terminal may not receive the service to which it<br>
subscribed. Therefore, in order for the terminal to receive the service to which it has<br>
subscribed, when a specific MBMS service is provided only at a preferred frequency<br>
and the terminal does not position itself at the preferred frequency, the terminal<br>
performs the cell reselection process even if the quality of the serving cell where the<br>
terminal is positioned is higher than the specific reference value.<br>
[34]	In the cell reselection process, the base station informs the terminal of an offset<br>
value to facilitate the selection of the preferred frequency by the terminal. The offset<br>
value is added to a quality measurement value of a cell positioned at the preferred<br>
frequency or is excluded from a quality measurement value of a cell not positioned at<br><br>
the preferred frequency. A specific frequency or a specific cell is determined to have a<br>
quality better than that of other cells based on this offset value. Accordingly, the base<br>
station may increase the probability that the terrninal moves to the preferred frequency<br>
or the specific cell.<br>
[35]	As mentioned above, the PLC is a method for j^atiomiig apluraUty of teirohiails at<br>
a specific frequency bandwidth in a certain area. That is, using this ELC method, the<br>
base station may reduce consumption of radio resources to provide the MBMS service<br>
to the terminals.<br>
[363	However, the PLC deliberately changes a distribution of terminals in order to<br>
position many teimijials at a preferred frequency. As a result, many terminals are<br>
positioned at the preferred frequency, but a relatively small number of terminals are<br>
positioned at other frequencies. Therefore, a load is converged only upon a specific<br>
cell, causing an imbalance between the frequencies and cells. In addition, as compared<br>
to a uniform distribution of terminals over several cells, when BLC is implemented, the<br>
terminals may receive services of lesser quality, resulting in an inefficient allocation of<br>
radio resources.<br>
[37]	As described above, at the initial step of the MBMS service, the terminal performs<br>
the cell reseleetion process to move into the cell of tbs preferred frequency on the basis<br>
of information transmitted from the base station even if the quality of the serving cell<br>
in which the terminal is positioned exceeds a certain reference value. However, after<br>
completing the MBMS service, when the quality of the cell is which the terminal is<br>
positioned exceeds the specific reference value, the terminal does not move into a new<br>
cell but remains positioned at the preferred frequency. That is, the state of the MBMS<br>
service start, i.e. that terminals positioned at other fluencies are converged upori the<br>
preferred frequency, continues until after the MBMS service is completed. A problem<br>
may occur, however, in which the number of terminals to which a cell may provide<br>
services with the appropriate quality is exceeded. This problem may continue even<br>
after the MBMS service has ended.<br>
[38]	In general, if the terminal is positioned in a cell with the best quality, much data<br>
may be exchanged with the base station even with relatively low power. However,<br>
depending on the current FLC method of the MBMS service, although, the terminal<br>
may receive a service with far better quality from another frequency or cell after the<br>
MBMS service is completed, the terminal does not change the frequency. Instead, the<br>
terminal remains continuously positioned at the same frequency as long as the quality<br>
of the currently selected cell is higher than a certain reference value. This distribution<br>
of terminals after the MBMS service is completed may waste power in terminals.<br>

Disclosure of Inventioii<br><br>
Technical Problem<br>
[39]	Accordingly, the present invention is directed to terminal distribution control for<br>
point-to-multipoint service that substantially obviates one or more problem's due to<br>
limitations and disadvantages of the related art.<br>
[40]	An object of the present invention is to provide uniform distribution of terminals<br>
that were converged upon a specific preferred frequency due to FLC (Frequency Layer<br>
Convergence), over several frequencies upon point-to-multipoint service completion.<br>
[41]	Additional advantages, objects, and features of the invention will be set forth in<br>
part in the description which follows and in part will become apparent to those having<br>
ordinary skill in the art upon examination of the following or may be learned from<br>
practice of the invention. The objectives and other advantages of the invention may be.<br>
realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the written description<br>
and claims hereof as well as the appended drawings.<br>
Technical Solution<br>
[42]	To achieve these objects and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose<br>
of the invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, in one embodiment, a<br>
method for controlling a user equipment (UE) capable of receiving a point-<br>
to-multipoint service in a wireless communication system comprises receiving a point-<br>
to-multipoint service and performing a cell reselection in response to completion of the<br>
receiving of the point-to-multipoint service. The cell reselection is performed among<br>
multiple frequencies.<br>
[43]	The cell reselection may be performed in response to signaling from the network. .<br>
The cell reselection may be performed regardless of whether cell reselection criteria<br>
are satisfied. The cell reselection criteria may comprise at least one of a cell reselection<br>
reference value between frequencies and a cell reselection reference value within a<br>
frequency.<br>
[44]	The cell reselection criteria may be embodied in frequency layer dispersion (ELD)<br>
information. Alternatively, the cell reselection criteria may be embodied in frequency<br>
layer convergence (FLC) information.<br>

Mode for Invention<br>
[52]	Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever<br>
possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to<br>
the same or like parts.<br>
[53]	The present invention may be embodied in a mobile communications system such<br>
as the UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System) developed by the<br>
3GPP. However, the present invention may also be applied to communications systems<br>
operated using other specifications. Furthermore, the point-to-multipoint service<br>
■ referred to herein may be a multimedia broadcast/multicast service (MBMS) or other<br>
type of service. Additionally, the terminal referred to herein, may be a user equipment<br>
(UE) or other type of terminal.<br>
[54]	Using the present invention, a UTRAN may utilize and share resources more ef-<br>
ficiently. Furthermore, a terminal may receive services in a cell more efficiently and<br>
with better quality. In one embodiment, a terminal moving into a preferred frequency<br>
by FLC (Frequency Layer Convergence) performs cell reselection and moves to a<br>
frequency with a relatively better quality, after a corresponding MBMS service is<br>
completed. That is, when the MBMS service is completed, the terminal is notified of<br>
the completion of the MBMS service by the base station and performs a cell re-<br>
selection process. In.the cell reselection process, the terminal searches available<br>
frequencies as candidate frequencies. The completion of an MBMS service is also<br>
known as the end of ah MBMS session.<br>
[55]	Furthermore, when the MBMS service is completed, the base station may<br>
uniformly distribute many terminals converged upon a preferred frequency over<br><br>
several frequencies. The base station may recognize the load generated in each cell at<br>
each frequency. Therefore, the base station may regulate FLC information to<br>
congregate multiple terminals on a specific frequency bandwidth. The specific	■ -<br>
frequency bandwidth that the multiple terminals are converged upon by the base<br>
station is the preferred frequency. Alternatively, the base station may instruct the<br>
multiple terminals to be distributed over several frequency bandwidths.<br>
[56]	The FLC information may include details regarding the frequencies that each<br>
MBMS is being transmitted. The FLC information may also include details regarding<br>
measuring parameters, measurement compensated values, or offsets to be applied to<br>
cells when the terminal performs cell reselection. Furthermore, the FLC information<br>
may include a basis for determining a cell change, or instructions regarding whether<br>
the cell reselection should be performed with respect to various frequencies.<br>
[57]	When the base station provides the MBMS service, if the number of terminals<br>
converged on the preferred frequency is not high enough to cause problems in<br>
providing other services, or if the terminals have already been converged to maximum<br>
capacity on another frequency and additional terminals may not be converged on the<br>
another frequency, the base station does not instruct the terminals to perform cell re-<br>
selection, even if the MBMS service is completed. However, when the base station is<br>
required to distribute terminals converged on the preferred frequency over several<br>
frequencies, the base station may instruct the terminal to perform cell reselection, even<br>
though the quality of a preferred frequency in a cell at which the terminal is currently<br>
positioned is greater than a cell reselection reference value.<br>
[58]	Figure 4 is a diagram illustrating terminal distribution control for a point-<br>
to-multipoint service, according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[59]	Referring to Figure 4, the base station transmits ELC information and the terminals<br>
move to the preferred frequency based on the FLC information. The terminals then<br>
receive the MBMS service. When the MBMS service is completed, the terminals may<br>
perform cell reselection by measuring the qualities of available frequencies and<br>
selecting a frequency in a cell having the best quality. The selected frequency may be<br>
in the current serving cell or another cell. If the terminal selects a frequency in another<br>
cell, the another cell is designated as the serving cell. The selection of a new serving<br>
cell may occur regardless of whether the quality of the new serving cell is higher than<br>
the cell reselection reference value. The cell reselection reference value may preferably<br>
be a cell reselection reference value between frequencies (Sintersearch) or a cell re-<br>
selection reference value within a frequency (Sintrasearch).<br>
[60]	After the MBMS session ends, the terminal may perform cell reselection regardless<br>
of the cell reselection reference value until the terminal measures qualities of several<br>
frequencies in order to select a frequency to be positioned. The terminal then moves to<br><br>
the selected frequency. Furthermore, cell reselection may be performed when the<br>
quality value of the serving cell is less than a specific reference value.<br>
[61]	During reception of the MBMS service by the terminal, when PLC information<br>
(e.g., information regarding a preferred frequency) is changed, when FLC information<br>
is not being transmitted from the base station, or when the base station notifies the<br>
terminal that the FLC is not being used, the terminal may perform cell reselection<br>
regardless of the cell reselection reference value with respect to available frequencies.<br>
Available frequencies are frequencies adjacent to the serving cell where the terminal is<br>
positioned.<br>
[62]	Furthermore, in another embodiment, a plurality of frequencies may be established<br>
as the preferred frequency. In such case, service quality may be maintained despite<br>
convergence. To this end, the base station may assign a plurality of frequencies as the<br>
preferred frequency and inform the terminal through a MCCH (MBMS Control<br>
Channel). Upon receiving the notification from the base station that more than one<br>
frequency is assigned as the preferred frequency, the terminal adds an offset value,<br>
which may be provided by the base station, to the preferred frequency to perform cell<br>
reselection.<br>
[63]	In cell reselection, if a plurality of preferred frequencies are related to a specific<br>
MBMS service transmitted from the base station, the terminal may select an arbitrary<br>
frequency and then select a cell that has the arbitrary frequency bandwidth as its<br>
serving cell. Furthermore, if a plurality of preferred frequencies related to the specific<br>
MBMS service are transmitted from the base station, the terminal may measure the _<br>
quality of the cell of the preferred frequency bandwidth to select a frequency<br>
bandwidth with an optimal quality and set the cell of the corresponding frequency<br>
bandwidth as its serving cell.<br>
[64]	Furthermore, in cell reselection, when the number of preferred frequencies related<br>
to the specific MBMS service received from the base station is changed, the terminal<br>
measures each frequency bandwidth to select an arbitrary bandwidth and then moves to<br>
the corresponding frequency bandwidth. Additionally, during cell reselection, when the<br>
number of preferred frequencies related to the specific MBMS service received from<br>
the base station is changed, the terminal measures each frequency bandwidth to select a<br>
frequency bandwidth which provides the best quality and then moves into the cor-<br>
responding frequency bandwidth. Also, in the cell reselection process, when the FLC<br>
information transmitted from the base station to the terminal does not include the in-<br>
formation related to the preferred frequency, the terminal performs the cell reselection<br>
process by searching available frequencies as candidate frequencies.<br>
[65]	However, once the MBMS service is completed, when the cell reselection process<br>
is required to search several frequencies as candidate frequencies, measurement of the<br><br>
qualities with respect to available frequencies by the terminal in order to determine a<br>
cell to be positioned may require a significant time period. This time period for<br>
measurement may result in an increase in service disconnection time for the terminal.<br>
Therefore, after the MBMS service is completed, when the terminal performs cell re-<br>
selection by searching various frequencies as candidate frequencies, the terminal may<br>
not measure all frequencies. Rather, the terrninal may select an arbitrary frequency<br>
among the available frequencies, and move to the cell of the arbitrary frequency.<br>
[66]	In one embodiment, a method for controlling a user equipment (UE) capable of<br>
receiving a point-to-multipoint service in a wireless communication system comprises<br>
receiving a point-to-multipoint service and performing a cell reselection in response to<br>
completion of the receiving of the point-to-multipoinl: service. The cell reselection is<br>
performed among multiple frequencies.<br>
[67]	The cell reselection may be performed in response to signaling from the network.<br>
The cell reselection may be performed regardless of whether cell reselection criteria<br>
are satisfied. The cell reselection criteria may comprise at least one of a cell reselection<br>
reference value between frequencies and a cell reselection reference value within a<br>
frequency.<br>
[68]	The cell reselection criteria may be embodied in frequency layer dispersion (FLD)<br>
information. Alternatively, the cell reselection criteria may be embodied in frequency<br>
layer convergence (PLC) information.<br>
[69]	The point-to-multipoint service may be a multimedia service. The point-<br>
to-multipoint service may be received from a UTMS terrestrial radio network<br>
(UTRAN). The cell reselection may be performed among available frequencies.<br>
[70]	The present invention may provide for, after an MBMS service is completed, the<br>
terminal may perform cell reselection. Accordingly, the terminal may move into a cell<br>
in which a service is provided with an optimal quality. Therefore, load may be<br>
minimized from being converged upon a specific cell.<br>
[71]	It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and<br>
variations may be made in the present invention without departing from the spirit or<br>
scope of the inventions. Thus, it is intended that the present invention covers the modi-<br>
fications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the<br>
