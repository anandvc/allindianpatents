				<td>Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to liquid metering More particularly, the invention provides a device capable of registering very low flows, being particularly useful in the laboratory and in medical applications, including intravenous infusions, blood flow control and urine output measurement.<br>
Background Art<br>
Flow meters for liquids have many important applications such as furnishing information in medical applications, research, industrial and agricultural work. Known types of flow meter include the nutating-disk, lobed impeller, orifice flow obstruction, tapered tube Rota meter, turbine, and magnetic types. The state of the art in flow meter development is represented by recent US Patents, among them nos. 5, 571, 964 and 5, 581,026 to Swada et al., and no. 5,698,793 to Carmichael. Conventional types of flow meter become unreliable for low flows, and for very low flows which may be discontinuous no meaningful results are obtained. Yet there is a need for such measurements in applications such as for example for metering the urine output of some critical hospital patients.<br>
In many hospitals it is common that the average urine flow is determined hourly by having a nurse or attendant examine the transparent graduated collection bag located below the bed of the patient. In intensive care departments such personnel are likely to be distracted by more urgent tasks and omit to take such measurements. The method is costly, unreliable and due to the flexible collection bag, also inaccurate.<br>
Many special devices have been proposed. Among patent disclosures are devices for rainfall measurement and meters which are either intended for urine flow measurement or can be adapted for such purpose.<br>
Dye et al. in US Patent No. 3, 859, 854 disclose an apparatus for measuring a liquid discharge, which includes a receptacle including a wall, a cup shaped pan, and a chamber below the pan. Liquid is accumulated in a compartment, and the height of the liquid is measured.<br>
Wurster proposes a capacitance type of measurement for urine flow in US Patent No. 4,051,431. Using the urine as an electrical conductor and as a electric, the capacitance is used to derive the volume of urine present.<br>
Nehrbass in US Patent No. 4,099,412 proposes to use a Rota meter to measure the instantaneous flow rate of urine discharge.<br>
In US patent No. 4,484,582 Rotenberg et al. disclose a system for measuring flow of electrolytic fluids, wherein a pair of electrodes are flush with the surface of a cylindrical flow cell. A monopolar pulse train is applied across the electrodes to effect a cell impedance inversely proportional to the flow rate.<br>
Jespersen describes optical sensor means to operate a lower and an upper valve described in US Patent No. 4,343,316. Intermittent discharge of a measured volume is used to indicate urine flow rate.<br>
Parrish discloses an ultrasonic transceiver in a measuring system he describes in US Patent No. 4,448,207. The transceiver is arranged to periodically measure the height level of a urine column.<br>
Leveen discloses a meter based on an optical sensor in US Patent No. 4,532,936. A peristaltic pump is used to empty the measurement column at a known rate.<br>
Carter et al describes a pressure sensor in a funnel-shaped device described in US Patent No. 4,554,687. A pressure transducer produces an electrical signal in response to air pressure resulting from urine accumulation. He further details a second variation using a sealed vertical air column in US Patent No. 4,683,748.<br>
A device intended for flow measurement of small liquid volumes is disclosed by Prestele in US Patent No. 4,559,831. He channels the liquid through a small diameter tube into which gas bubbles are also fed. By measuring the advance of the bubble, fluid rate can be deduced.<br>
Westphal et al. suggest a force transducer to weigh collected urine in an apparatus described in US Patent No. 5,789,097.<br>
Nelson proposes devices to measure rainfall by electronic drop counting in US Patents 4,520,667 and 4,827,766. The Latter patent discloses a vent tube which is partially liquid immersed.<br>
Most flow measuring systems measure some related parameter to deduce flow rate. However errors are introduced when the relationship between the measured parameter and the flow rate is not constant. Such relationship is often effected by temperature changes, and by changes in the fluid density and viscosity. Few prior-art systems are capable of measuring extremely low flows, such as a flow of a few drops per hour.<br>
It is therefore one of the objects of the present invention to obviate the<br>
disadvantages of prior art flow meters and to provide an apparatus which is able to<br>
record flow of a few drops per hour.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a flowmeter which<br>
meets the requirements for registering urine output of catheterized patients, and<br>
also for metering infusion rates.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The present invention achieves the above objects by providing a low-flow metering<br>
device for measuring the volume of an amount of liquid exceeding 0.05 ml.,<br>
comprising:<br>
a)	a first chamber having an inlet, and an outlet in fluid communication with a<br>
second chamber, said first chamber containing a flow restriction element creating a<br>
ilaminar flow and said outlet of said first chamber being provided with a drop<br>
generator leading to said second chamber and sized to release a series of droplets<br>
, each of said droplets forming and breaking away under its own weight from liquid<br>
In the drop generator orifice fed thereto by said flow restriction element,<br>
b)	an overflow conduit extending between an upper area of said first chamber and<br>
3 lower area of said second chamber for equalizing gas pressure between said two<br>
Chambers;<br>
e) electronic means positioned in said second chamber below said drop generator<br>
for counting the passage of each droplet exiting therefrom; and<br>
d) an information processing unit connected to said electronic means for receiving<br>
and recording information and for measuring the time interval between successive<br>
droplets and for calculating flow rates and total volume therefrom while dealing with<br>
variations in droplet size as a function of the time interval between successive<br>
droplets.<br>
Deacriptfon of Preferred Embodiments<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention there is provided a low-flow metering device wherein said electronic means comprise a pair of electrodes positioned in spaced-apart relationship one above the other below the orifice of the drop generator.<br>
In a meet preferred embodiment of the preisent invention there is provided a low-flow metering device wherein the dement creating a laminar flow ia a molded plastic labyrinth.<br>
Yet further embodiments of the Invention will be described hereinafter. In U.S. Patent no.4,827,766 there is described and claimed a rain gauge wherein the drop generator comprises of a very small diameter filter. Clearly, such filter will function only a short time before becoming blocked and thereby completely disabling the device.<br>
In contradistinction thereto, the present Invention in some embodiments uses filter devices which are not size-restricted and In other embodiments flow is restricted by a labyrinth. The technique of using a labyrinth for flow restriction while providing a flow path large enough to allow passage for small particles has been extensively proved in the field of agricultural drip Irrigation tubing.<br>
Furthermore, in contradistinction to US Patent 4,827,766, in the present invention the ma/or portion of liquid in the upper cramber is directly available to the drop generator, allowing fast drop generation if necessary.<br>
It will be realized that the novel device of the present invention is not limited to the use of electrodes for drop detection. An optical sensor such as a light source directing a beam at a photocell can te used, being particularly suitable where the liquid being measured is coloned, for example blood. In case of transparent liquids, the fight beam Is deflected away from the photocell. Alternatively, each drop can be detected and registered by a capacltive proximity sensor. Recently much progress has been made In reducing the physical size of optical and other sensors, making possible their use in small instruments. Piezoelectric devices have also been improved and cost-reduced in recent years, such device could be used to absorb the impact of a falling droplet, the advantage being the high-frequency response of the output charge.<br>
In U.S. Patent 3,641,543 (D1), there is described a low-level detector and drop rate monitor, particularly for intravenous feeding apparatus. This patent primarily relates to the electronic means of detecting the drops and fluid to be monitored and relates only briefly to the mechanical apparatus which is of little importance to the invention described in said patent.   While the drawing in figure 1 in said patent, shows the provision of an air line 11, in fact said patent does not teach or suggest the device of the present invention to a person skilled in the art since the device as shown in said figure, does not work.   Specifically, since air line 11 extends into an inverted bottle which has no inlet, as the liquid flows therefrom a vacuum is created in the upper portion of container 12 which will balance against the force of gravity and not permit complete flow of the liquid from said bottle. Furthermore, valve mechanism 20 is separate from the drop formation opening and if said valve is closed the drops will fall until they fill the second chamber whereby electrodes 38 and 40 will be unable to measure any drop formation.   Finally, said patent does not teach or suggest the arrangement of the present invention, wherein the flow restriction •element leads directly to the drop generator and instead in said patent, and in other patents discussed hereinafter, the flow restriction element 20 is in fact positioned in the line after the drop generator.    Therefore, said patent neither teaches nor suggests the present device.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,098,408 (D2), teaches the use of an automatic intravenous flow cntroller wherein the primary purpose is to restrict the flow in a controlled way. In said patent, drops are formed along the outer surface of an icicle or stylus drop former positioned in fluid communication between an inlet and outlet end of the flow controller. These drops break away from the material of the icicle and the surface tension between the icicle and the fluid determines the size of the drops. The drops are not counted and the drops only serve as a rough visual indication of flow rate. In contradistinction, according to the present invention, the drops are formed within the drop generator and each droplet breaks away under its own weight from liquid in the drop generator orifice, i.e. by the breaking of liquid-liquid surface tension.<br>
U.S. Patent 4,520,667 (D3), teaches a non-mechanical digital rain gauge.  As can be seen from the description in column 5 of said patent, the device is designed in<br>
such a manner that there will never be more than 2 rain drops entering the opening thereof in a second. Therefore, no flow restriction device is required or taught and each drop that enters the device passes into the drop generator and is counted.<br>
U.S. Patent 3,871,229 (D4), teaches a drop sensing apparatus with a flow restriction device positioned along the tube feeding the needle. While flow may be corrected by said flow restriction device, as a result of the drop rate, this patent neither teaches nor suggests an arrangement wherein the flow restriction element leads directly to the drop generator.<br>
In U.S. Patent 3,712,132 (D5), there is described a droplet monitoring probe which comprises 2 electric wires spaced a known distance apart from each other and connected at one end to means for establishing a DC potential between the wires. ;A drop in the fluid stream momentarily contacts both wires causing an electrical signal, which may be counted. These droplets, however, are not falling droplets and instead, are droplets forming and flowing in a gas turbine.<br>
in U.S. Patent 4,261,388 (D6), there is described a drop rate controller for controlling flow of fluid from an infusion fluid reservoir to an intravenous infusion site apparatus with a flow restriction device positioned along the tube feeding the jnfusion site. While flow may be corrected by said flow restriction device, as a result Of the drop rate, this patent neither teaches nor suggests an arrangement wherein the flow restriction element leads directly to the drop generator.<br>
Thus it will be realized that none of said patents teaches or suggests a low-flow metering device as described and claimed herein, wherein the flow restriction element leads directly to the'drop generator and wherein there is provided means for measuring the time interval between successive droplets and for calculating flow rates and total volume therefrom while dealing with variations in droplet size as a function of the time interval between successive droplets.<br>
It will be understood that the novel device of the present invention serves to measure flow even when fluid supply is non-continuous. As even a single droplet is registered by the electrodes or optical means, and there is no practical limit to the time span between one droplet and the next very low flow rates can be reliably metered. Applications include infusions, urine output, rainfall measurement, patient's blood input or output, patient feeding with liquids, and determining the resutts of overhead irrigation in agriculture.<br>
The invention provides means for measuring the time interval between successive droplets, and calculates flow rates therefrom. It is realized that the size of the droplets may change in relation to said time interval. Means for dealing with variation in droplet size are provided as wifi be seen with reference to FIG. 2a and 2b.<br>
Furthermore, an embodiment of the invention, described with reference to FIG. 7 is able to recognize very fast inflow causing overflow and to report such condition', as well as being able to report a full collection bag, and to activate an alarm if needed.<br>
The invention will now be described in connection with certain preferred embodiments with reference to the following illustrative figures so that it may be more fully understood.<br>
With specific reference now to the figures in detail, it is stressed that the particulars shown are by way of example and for purposes of illustrative discussion of the preferred embodiments of the present invention only and are presfented in the cause of providing what is believed to be the most useful and readlly understood description of the principles and conceptual aspects of the invention.

Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
There is seen in RG. 1 a low-flow metering device 10. The flow range which can be detected is typically from about 0.05 ml, that is about one droplet, up to about 6 liters, per hour.<br>
A first chamber 12 has an inlet 14, and an outlet 16 in fluid communication with a second chamber 17. Preferably the diameter of the outlet orifice 16 is smaller than the diameter of the inlet 14. Advantageously the diameter of the outlet orifice 16 is between about 3 and 6 mm as such a size is suitable for forming droplets 18 when a liquid 20 having a viscosity similar to water is passed therethrough. However the outlet 16 is larger for handling more viscous fluids such as oil.<br>
The first chamber 12 contains an element creating a laminar flow, which in the present embodiment comprises a porous substance 24 supported by a screening element 22. Suitably, the porous substance 24 is a fibrous mat. Granular particles 26, for example sand, may be used either alone or in combinations with the mat 24 as shown..<br>
The outlet 16 of the first chamber 12 acts as a drop generator leading to a power second chamber 17 The outlet 16 is sized to release a series cf dropiets 18. each droplet 18 forming and breaking away under its own weight from liquid in the drop generator orifice 19.<br>
An overflow conduit 21 extends between an upper area of the first chamber 12 and a lower area of the second chamber 17. One of the functions of the candcn 21 is to equalize gas pressure between the two chambers 12, 17.<br>
The  conduit 21   also  prevents flooding  of the  upper area  in   case  of unexpectedly fast Inlet flows.<br>
Electrodes 28 are positioned in the second chamber 17 in spaced-apart relationship one above the other below the outlet orifice 16. This arrangement allows operation of the device 10 even rf installed slightly off the vertical axis Electrodes 28 count and time the passage of each droplet 18 passing and contacting electrodes 28. In the present embodiment a voltage is applied between the electrodes 28, and the resulting current is recorded. Current is practically zero when no droplet is present between electrodes 28, but does flow when a droplet 18 is in contact and bridges the electrodes 28.<br>
If fluid conductivity is of interest the current value is recorded, If this is not required, the current is merely recorded as a pulse, which is counted electronically.  . Droplet counting is done by an information processing  unit 30 electronically connected to the electrodes 28 for receiving and recording information.<br>
The information shown on the display 32 includes flow per unit time 34. Additionally the display shows total flow 36, start time 38, and elapsed time 40.<br>
In the present embodiment electrical conductivity of the fluid passing between the electrodes is also shown 42. Electrical conductivity is an indicator of substances present in liquid 20 which, for example with urine, may be of interest to medical staff.<br>
With reference to the rest of the figures, similar reference numerals have been used to identify similar parts.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 2a, there is seen a low-flow metering device 4* particularly useful for medical purposes.<br>
The upper chamber 42, the lower chamber 46 and the electrodes 48 arc par of 4 self-contained disposable unit 50. Electncal connection means, such as a socxet 52 and plug 54, provide the connection to the information processing unit 56 Present hospital practice is to make increasingly wide use of disposable items, 85 the costs and nsks associated with sterilization and re-use are high, and steriluratroo prodsdures are used mainly for high-cost metal items.<br>
In the present embodiment 44 measurement sccurecy is enhanced by the addition of a drop size correction mechanism 58. Drop size varies as a non-linear function of time after separation of the previous drcp. This relationship is Illustrated In FIG. 2b, and this relationship is stored in an electronic look-up table included in the mechanism 58. The information processing unft 53 is In receipt of Information as to the timing of drop release, and includes a correction mechanism based on this relationship which electronically adjusts the reported output flow 60 and volume 62 after correction.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates a part of a tow-flow metering device 64 similar to that seen In FIG. 1.<br>
In the present embodiment the element creating a laminar flow is a molded plastic labyrinth 66, which slows liquid flow while remaining resistant to blockage by solid particles below the size of the labyrinth passages.<br>
Seen in FIG. 4 is a low-flow metering device 68 generally similar to that seen In FlG. 1.<br>
A reservoir bag 70 is positioned between a source of liquid 72 and the drop generator 16,24,26. The bag 70 acts as a buffer between an intermittently fast input source 72 and the slow continuous discharge through output orifice 16. For urine monitoring, a bag up to 400 ml is usually suitable.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 5, there is depicted 11 part of a low-flow metering device 74, further comprising a calibrated collection bag 76 positioned to receive droplets 18 after their passage between electrodes 28. The collection bag 76 has calibrations 78 and so provides a useful check on the information recorded electronically by the display 32 seen in FIG. 1. In the present embodiment the bag 76 has a 1.5 liter capacity, a transparent front 80, and a white opaque back 82 for convenience of observing liquid 20 collected therein.<br>
FIG. 6 shows a low-flow metering device 84 further comprising means for communicating Information from the processing unit 86 to a central monitor 88. The processing unit 86 Is a microprocessor which Includes a dock and an arithmetic togic unit and may also indude the drop size correction mechanism 58 described with reference to FIGS. 2a and 2b. Electrodes 26 receive a voltage from a supply 90. Current measurements from an electroae 28 are made and converted to digital form in the interface 92. Information is sent bv cable 94, as shown in the present<br>
embodiment, or by infra-red signals. The central monitor 83 is of particular value in intensive care units, where a nurse is charged with the supervision of multiple patients. The centra] monitor 88 is connected to an alarm 96 which is triggered by data readings which require immediate action by the nursing staff. Additionally an alarm 97 connected to microprocessor 86 is provided at the site where flow measurement is being carried out<br>
FIG. 7 shows an embodiment of the low-flow metering device 100 having three flow paths.<br>
A first path starts at the upper face of a filter element 108, which receives an ultra-low flow from the inlet 102. The filter element 108 has porous outer walls 110, the purpose of which will become apparent from the description of the second flow path. The third flow path refers to flows above design range. The first flow path leads to the fitter element lower face 112, into a fitter support cup 114. The flow path continues through a lower aperture 117 at the base of the cup 114. The droplets fallowing this path next run down the outer face of a vertical tube 116,  and  from there enter the drop generator 104. The tube outer face is advantageously provided with a groove 118 to facilitate descent of the droplet<br>
The tube 116 serves three further purposes: a| it equalizes air pressure between the upper 120 and lower 122 parts of the<br>
chamber, which is helpful for obtaining consistent readings; b) it supports the filter cup 114; and<br>
c}i it prevents flooding of the upper chamber 120 by serving as an overflow tube in case the device is subjected to fast flows for which it is not intended. The second flow path leads from the upper face 106 to the filter element 10E, through a part of said element, and out through the filter element porous walh 10 Discharge through the wall 110 occurs as the filter element 108 intentionally is made with a limited through-flow capacity. The second flow path continues into the upper chamber 120 and the into the drop generator 104<br>
The third flow path refers to overload conditions. If input is so fast that tnc: upper chamber 120 is almost full, the excess drains down inside tube 116 Tht excess fluid is however directed aver the electrodes 28, which sense unusually -cnc liquid contact and report overflow and/or sound an alarm.<br>
Outlet 140 can be connected to a collection bag 76, seen in FIG. 5. Shcuic collection bag 76 be full and, due to an attendant not having replaced the full beg with an empty bag, a portion of the lower part of the chamber 122 will be flooded. Electrodes 28 register the presence of a continuous supply of fluid and activate an alarm 96 seen in FIG. 6. However as air is trapped between the fluid entering the housing outlet 140 and the drop generator 104, flooding of the drop generator 104 is prevented. Consequently, after the collection bag 76 is exchanged for an empty bag, flow measurements will proceed immediately without significant errors.<br>
The upper part 120 of the chamber is provided with an air vent 123. Seen in detail in FIG. 8 is the drop generator 104 which comprises three stacked components 122,124, and 126.<br>
An upper inlet funnel 127 receives fluid from either or both the flow paths described with reference to FIG. 7, and directs the liquid to the intermediate section 120 into the labyrinth inlet 124. The labyrinth 130 allows low flows to pass normally, but slows down flows which are too fast for direct conversion into discrete drops. The labyrinth outlet 132 is arranged to pass fluid to a lower section 126. A drop-direction pin-like element 134 extends downwardly from the center of the outlet orifice 136. A drop forming on the pin 134 falls when its size and weight am sufficient to overcome the surface tension of the fluid. The drop 138 fails to contact electrodes 28 and is then discharged through the chamber outlet 140.<br>
Preferably the external wall 142 of the lower section 126 of the outlet entice 136 is made of a hydrophobic material such as fluorinated etnylene propylene. This presents the drop 138 from backing up the external wall 142.<br>
