1<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of losartan and its pharmaceutically acceptable salt like losartan potassium. Losartan potassium is chemically known as 2-butyl-4-chloro-l-[p-(0-lH-tetrazole-5-yl-phenyl)benzyl]imidazole-5-methanol monopotassium (which is hereinafter referred to using the adopted name "losartan potassium" having the Formula I. The present invention further relates to the a novel process for preparation of crystalline Losartan Potassium Form -1.<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be considered as an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of common general knowledge in the field.<br>
Losartan potassium, also known as 2-butyl-4-chloro-l-[p-(o-lH-tetrazole-5-yl-phenyl) benzyl] imidazole-5-methanol monopotassium salt, is a competitive AT1 angiotensin II receptor antagonist and is commercially available in pharmaceutical products sold using the trademark COZAAR™. See, e.g. The Merck Index, Thirteenth Edition, 2001, p. 1000, monograph 5604; and Physician's Desk Reference, "Cozarar," 58th Edition, pp. 1952-1957 (2004).<br>
It is known in the art to synthesize Losartan Potassium from the acid form of Losartan. Losartan Potassium (Shown as the compound of Formula (I) above) is known in the art is synthesized by reacting its acid (Shown as the compound of Formula (II) above) with KOH. The intermediate acid Formula (II) in turn is synthesized by detritylation of 2-n-butyl-4-chloro-5-hydroxymethyl-l-[((2’-triphenylmethyltetrazole-5-yl)biphenyl-4-yl)-methyl] imidazole (shown as the compound of formula (III) below)<br>

Further isolating polymorph Form I by filtration after azeotropic removal of water, till water content in the mixture is reduced below 0.1%.<br>
Polymorphism is the occurrence of different crystalline forms of a single compound and it is a property of some compounds and complexes. Thus, polymorphs are distinct solids sharing the same molecular formula, yet each polymorph may have distinct physical properties. Therefore, a single compound may give rise to a variety of polymorphic forms where each form has different and distinct physical properties, such as different solubility profiles, different melting point temperatures and/or different x-ray diffraction peaks. Since the solubility of each polymorph may vary, identifying the existence of pharmaceutical polymorphs is essential for providing pharmaceuticals with predicable solubility profiles. It is desirable to investigate all solid-state forms of a drug, including all polymorphic forms, and to determine the stability, dissolution and flow properties of each polymorphic form. Polymorphic forms of a compound can be distinguished in a laboratory by X-ray diffraction spectroscopy and by other methods such as, infrared spectrometry. For a general review of polymorphs and the pharmaceutical applications of polymorphs see G. M. Wall, Pharm Manuf. 3, 33 (1986); J. K. Haleblian and W. McCrone, J. Pharm. Sci., 58, 911 (1969); and J. K. Haleblian, J. Pharm. Sci, 64, 1269 (1975), all of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Thus, there is still a need to provide a cost-effective, non-hazardous, simple, efficient and industrially viable process which can overcome some common drawbacks of the prior art processes for preparing cyrstalline polymorphic Form I of Losartan potassium.<br>
It is also an object of the present invention to provide a crystalline Form - I of Losartan Potassium by a novel process. <br>

0.5%, measured by area percentage of HPLC.<br>

The most preferred embodiment of the present invention is to prepare crystalline Losartan Potassium Form - I having purity greater than or equal to 99.5% by HPLC and having all the single individual impurities not more than 0.1% and the total impurities not more than 1.0%.<br>
It is one of the preferred embodiments of the present invention to provide process for preparation of Losartan potassium having mean particle size less than 400 fan, preferably less than 200 pm and more preferably less than 100 //m when measured with Malvern light scattering instruments.<br>
Although the invention has been described with reference to a specific example, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the invention may be embodied in many other forms.<br>
The process of the present invention will be explained in more detail with reference to the following examples, which are provided by way of illustration only and should not be constructed as limit to the scope of the claims in any manner. <br>
Examples <br>
Example-1: Preparation of Trityl Losartan Formula (III):<br>
To a solution of N-(triphenylmethyl)-5-4'-(bromomethyl)biphenyl-2-yl]tetrazole [1.0 Kg; 1.61mol] (KL-2), 2-n-butyl-4-chloro-lH-imidazol-5-carboxaldehyde [0.28 kg; 1.501 mol] (KL-1) and tetra butyl ammonium bromide [0.01 kg; 0.03mol] in 5L, toluene is added 0.6 L of a 3 M solution of sodium hydroxide in water. The reaction is vigorously stirred and<br>
refluxed for 3.5 hour at 80°C to 90°C. The progress of the reaction is monitored by HPLC. The reaction mass is cooled to room temperature and is allowed to settle. The tower aqueous<br>
layer is discarded and the toluene layer is washed with water (2 L). The toluene layer is<br>
14<br><br>
treated with solution of sodium borohydride (0.027 kg, 0.729 mol) in special denatured spirit 1.20 L at 35°C to 45°C is added slowly. Progress of the reaction is monitored by HPLC. The pH of the reaction mass is adjusted with dilute acetic acid from 7.0 to 7.2. The layers were<br>
separated and organic layer was washed with water. The toluene was distilled under vacuum<br>
below 80°C and the resulting residue was treated with ethyl acetate at 70°C to 80°C, filtered<br>
and washed with ethyl acetate and dried at 50°C to 60°C.<br>
IH NMR(CDO.: # 9. 73 (S,1F1,) ; 7.92 (m,l 1-1) ; 7.51-6. 81 (m, 22H); 5.45 (s, 2H); 2.49<br>
(t,2H); 1.64 (q, 21-1); 1.28 (sextet, 2H) and 0.86 (t, 3H)<br>
Example-2: Preparation of Trityl Losartan Formula (II):<br>
Trityl losartan (1.0 Kg), 0.375 Kg of sulfuric acid and 2.4 L of water were taken in RBF. 2.6 L of acetonitrile was added to the above reaction mass at an ambient temperature. The above reaction mass is slowly dumped into the freshly prepared sodium hydroxide solution at 10°C to 20° and the reaction mass is stirred for 30 minutes. 0.05 Kg of activated charcoal is added. The reaction mass is filtered through Hyflosupercel bed and washed with acetonitrile and water mixture. The filtrate is treated with acetonitrile in RBF at 15°C to 35°C. The pH of the reaction mass was adjusted to 5.0 to 5.5 by adding dilute acetic acid. The product thus obtained was filtered and washed with water. The wet-cake were taken in acetonitrile in RBF and refluxed to about 75°C to 82°C for 2 to 3 hours. The reaction mixture is cooled to about 30°C to about 40°C. Filtered and washed with acetonitrile and dried at 70°C to 80°C to obtain Losartan free acid. <br>
Example-3: Preparation of crystalline Losartan potassium Form-I<br>
Potassium hydroxide (0.11 Kg) and ethanol (3.20 L) were taken in RBF. The reaction mixture was stirred to dissolve completely at about 20°C to 40°C. Losartan free acid (0.080 Kg) prepared as above as added to the clear solution and further stirred to ensure clear solution as at about 20°C to 40°C. Activated charcoal was added to the reaction mixture. After obtaining the clear solution, the reaction mass was treated with diisopropyl ether (17.60 L) at 20°C to 40°C and stirred for 2 to 2.5 hours and reaction was monitored by HPLC. The precipitated product was filtered and washed with diisopropyl ether. The product-was dried/at<br><br><br>
70°C to 80°C to obtain crystalline Losartan Form-I.<br><br>
