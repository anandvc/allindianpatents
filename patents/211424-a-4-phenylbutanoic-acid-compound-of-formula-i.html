SMITHKLINE BEECHAM CORPORATION, a corporation organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, one of the United States of America, of One Franklin Plaza, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19103, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a 4-phenylbutanoic acid compound of formula (I).<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to pharmaceutically active compounds which inhibit the vitronectin receptor and are useful for the treatment of inflammation, cancer and cardiovascular disorders, such as atherosclerosis and restenosis, and diseases wherein bone resorption is a factor, such as osteoporosis.<br>
	BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Integrins are a superfamily of cell adhesion receptors, which are transmembrane glycoproteins expressed on a variety of cells. These cell surface adhesion receptors include gpllb /Illa (the fibrinogen receptor) and αvB3 (the vitronectin receptor). The fibrinogen receptor gpllb /Ilia is expressed on the platelet surface, and mediates platelet aggregation<br>
l5     and the formation of a hemostatic clot at the site of a bleeding wound. Philips, et al. Blood., 1988, 71, 831. The vitronectin receptor ανB3 is expressed on a number of cells, including endothelial, smooth muscle, osteoclast, and tumor cells, and, thus, it has a variety of functions. The αvB3 receptor expressed on the membrane of osteoclast cells mediates the adhesion of osteoclasts to the bone matrix, a key step in the bone resorption process. Ross,<br>
20     et al., J. Biol. Chenu, 1987,262, 7703. A disease characterized by excessive bone<br>
resorption is osteoporosis. The αν,β3 receptor expressed on human aortic smooth muscle cells mediates their migration into neointima, a process which can lead to restenosis after percutaneous coronary angioplasty. Brown, et al., Cardiovascular Res., 1994,23, 1815. Additionally, Brooks, et al., Cell, 1994, 79,1157 has shown that an ανB3 antagonist is able.<br>
25      to promote tumor regression by inducing apoptosis of angiogenic blood vessels. Thus, agents that block the vitronectin receptor would be.useful in treating diseases, such as osteoporosis, restenosis and cancer.<br>
The vitronectin receptor is now known to refer to three different integrins, designated ctvB], avB3 and 0^65. Horton, et al., Int. J. Exp. Pathol., 1990, 71,741. OyBi<br>
30     binds fibronectin and vitronectin. avB3 binds a large variety of ligands, including fibrin, fibrinogen, laminin, thrombospondin, vitronectin, von Willebrand"s factor, osteopontin and bone sialoprotein I. αvB5 binds vitronectin. The vitronectin receptor αvB5 has been shown to be involved in cell adhesion of a variety of cell types, including microvascular endothelial cells, (Davis, et al., J. Cell. Biol., 1993,57, 206), and its. role in angiogenesis<br>
35      has been confirmed. Brooks, et aL, Science, 1994, 264, 569. This integrin is expressed on blood vessels in human wound granulation tissue, but not in normal skin.<br><br><br>

This invention relates to pharmaceutically active compounds which inhibit the vitronectin receptor and are useful for the treatment of inflammation, cancer and cardiovascular disorders, such as atherosclerosis and restenosis, and diseases wherein bone resorption is a factor, such as osteoporosis.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Integrins are a superfamily Of cell adhesion receptors, which are transmembrane glycoproteins expressed on a variety of cells. These cell surface adhesion receptors include gpllb /Ilia (the fibrinogen receptor) and αVB3 (the vitronectin receptor). The fibrinogen receptor gpllb /Ilia is expressed on the platelet surface, and mediates platelet aggregation and the formation of a hemostatic clot at the site of a bleeding wound. Philips, et al.

The αvB3 receptor expressed on the membrane of osteoclast cells mediates the adhesion of osteoclasts to the bone matrix, a key step in the bone resorption process. Ross, et al, J. Biol. Chem., 1987,262, 7703. A disease characterized by excessive bone resorption is osteoporosis. The 063 receptor expressed on human aortic smooth muscle cells mediates their migration into neointima, a process which can lead to restenosis after percutaneous coronary angioplasty. Brown, et al., Cardiovascular Res., 1994, 28,1815. Additionally, Brooks, et al., Cell, 1994, 79,1157 has shown that an αvB3 antagonist is able to promote tumor regression by inducing apoptosis of angiogenic blood vessels. Thus, agents that block the vitronectin receptor would be. useful in treating diseases, such as osteoporosis, restenosis and cancer.<br>
The vitronectin receptor is now known to refer to three different integrins, designated αvB1, αv63 and αVB5. Horton, et al., Int. J. Exp. Pathol., 1990, 71, 741. αVB1 binds fibronectin and vitronectin. αvB3 binds a large variety of ligands, including fibrin, fibrinogen, laminin, thrombospondin, vitronectin, von Willebrand"s factor, osteopontin and bone sialoprotein I. αvB5 binds vitronectin. The vitronectin receptor αvB5 has been shown to be involved in cell adhesion of a variety of cell types, including microvascular endothelial cells, (Davis, et al., J. Cell. Biol., 1993,51, 206), and its role in angiogenesis has been confirmed. Brooks, et al., Science, 1994, 264, 569. This integrin is expressed on blood vessels in human wound granulation tissue, but not in normal skin.<br><br><br><br><br>
WO 01/17959	PCT/US00/24514<br>
The vitronectin receptor is known to bind to bone matrix proteins which contain the tri-peptide Arg-GIy-Asp (or RGD) motif. Thus, Horton, et al., Exp. Cell Res. 1991,195, 368, disclose that RGD-containing peptides and an anti-vitronectin receptor antibody (23C6) inhibit dentine resorption and cell spreading by osteoclasts. In addition, Sato, et al., J. Cell Biol 1990,111,1713 discloses that echistatin, a snake venom peptide which contains the RGD sequence, is a potent inhibitor of bone resorptionin tissue culture, and inhibits attachment of osteoclasts to bone.<br>
It has now been discovered that certain compounds are potent inhibitors of the αVB3 and αvB5 receptors. In particular, it has been discovered that such compounds are more potent inhibitors of the vitronectin receptor than the fibrinogen receptor.<br><br><br><br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention comprises compounds of the formula (I) as described hereinafter, which have pharmacological activity for the inhibition of the vitronectipn receptor and are useful in the treatment of inflammation, cancer and cardiovascular disorders, such as atherosclerosis and restenosis, and diseases wherein bone resorption is a factor, such as osteoporosis.<br>
This invention is also a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound according to formula (I) and a pharmaceutically carrier.<br>
This invention is also a method of treating diseases which are mediated by the vitronectin receptor. In a particular aspect, the compounds of this invention are useful for treating atherosclerosis, restenosis, inflammation, cancer and diseases wherein bone resorption is a factor, such as osteoporosis.<br><br>
25	DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br><br>
This invention comprises novel compounds which are more potent inhibitors of the vitronectin receptor than the fibrinogen receptor. This invention comprises compounds of formula (I):<br><br>
30(I) wherein:<br>
R1 isHet-orAn R2is<br><br><br><br><br>
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
Also included in this invention are pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts and complexes of the compounds of this invention. In cases wherein the compounds of this invention may have one or more chiral centers, unless specified, this invention includes each unique nonracemic compound which may be synthesized and resolved by conventional techniques. According to the present invention, the (S) configuration of the formula (I) compounds is preferred.<br>
In cases in which compounds have unsaturated carbon-carbon double bonds, both l0      the cis (Z) and trans (E) isomers are within the scope of this invention. In cases wherein<br>
compounds may exist in tautomeric forms, such as keto-enol tautomers, such as <br>
and , and each tautomeric form is contemplated as being included within this<br>
invention whether existing in equilibrium or locked in one form by appropriate substitution withR".<br>
15	The compounds of formula (I) inhibit the binding of vitronectin and other RGD-<br>
containing peptides to the vitronectin receptor. Inhibition of the vitronectin receptor on osteoclasts inhibits osteoclastic bone resorption and is useful in the treatment of diseases wherein bone resorption is associated with pathology, such as osteoporosis and osteoarthritis.<br>
20	In another aspect, this invention is a method for stimulating bone formation which<br>
comprises administering a compound which causes an increase in osteocalcin release. Increased bone production is a clear benefit in disease states wherein there is a deficiency of mineralized bone mass or remodeling of bone is desired, such as fracture healing and the prevention of bone fractures. Diseases and metabolic disorders which result in loss of bone<br>
25     structure would also benefit from such treatment. For instance, hyperparathyroidism, Paget"s disease, hypercalcemia of malignancy, osteolytic lesions produced by bone metastasis, bone loss due to immobilization or sex hormone deficiency, Behcet"s disease, osteomalacia, hyperostosis and osteopetrosis, could benefit from administering a compound of this invention.<br>
30	Additionally, since the compounds of the instant invention inhibit vitronectin<br>
receptors on a number of different types of cells, said compounds would be useful in the treatment of inflammatory disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, and cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis and restenosis. The compounds of Formula<br><br>
WO01/17959	PCT/US00/24514<br>
(I) of the present invention may be useful for the treatment or prevention of other diseases including, but not limited to, thromboembolic disorders, asthma, allergies, adult respiratory distress syndrome, graft versus host disease, organ transplant rejection, septic shock, eczema, contact dermatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and other autoimmune diseases. The compounds of the present invention may also be useful for wound healing.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are also useful for the treatment, including prevention, of angiogenic disorders. The term angiogenic disorders as used herein includes conditions involving abnormal neovascularization. Where the growth of new blood vessels is the cause of, or contributes to, the pathology associated with a disease, inhibition of<br>
10)      angiogenisis will reduce the deleterious effects of the disease. An example of such a<br>
disease target is diabetic retinopathy. Where the growth of new blood vessels is required to support growth of a deleterious tissue, inhibition of angiogenisis will reduce the blood supply to the tissue and thereby contribute to reduction in tissue mass based on blood supply requirements. Examples include growth of tumors where neovascularization is a continual requirement in order that the tumor grow and the establishment of solid tumor metastases. Thus, the compounds of the present invention inhibit tumor tissue angiogenesis, thereby preventing tumor metastasis and tumor growth.<br>
Thus, according to the methods of the present invention, the inhibition of angiogenesis using the compounds of the present invention can ameliorate the symptoms of<br>
20     the disease, and, in some cases, can cure the disease.<br>
Another therapeutic target for the compounds of the instant invention are eye diseases chacterized by neovascularization. Such eye diseases include corneal neovascular disorders, such as corneal transplantation, herpetic keratitis, luetic keratitis, pterygium and neovascular pannus associated with contact lens use. Additional eye diseases also include<br>
25      age-related macular degeneration, presumed ocular histoplasmosis, retinopathy of prematurity and neovascular glaucoma.<br>
This invention further provides a method of inhibiting tumor growth which comprises administering stepwise or in physical combination a compound of formula (I) and an antineoplastic agent, such as topotecan and cisplatin.<br>

10	An appropriate alkoxyphenylacetic acid, for instance 4-methoxyphenylacetic acid<br>
(1-1), is converted to the deoxybenzoin derivative 1-3 by reaction of the corresponding N-methoxy-N-mediylamide (1-2) with a metalated aromatic derivative, according to the general method of Weinreb (Tetrahedron Lett. 1981,22, 3815). Compound 1-3 is converted to the a,p-unsaturated ester 1-4 through the well-known Wittig reaction.<br>
l5      Optimally, the reaction is conducted using triethyl phosphonoacetate in the presence of a suitable base, generally sodium hydride or lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide, in an aprotic<br><br>
WO 01/17959	PCT/US00/24514<br>
solvent, such as toluene, THF, or mixtures thereof. Reduction of the olefin group of 1-4 is optimally accomplished by hydrogenation in the presence of a palladium catalyst, for instance palladium on activated charcoal, in a suitable solvent, such as EtOAc, MeOH, EtOH, i-PrOH, or mixtures thereof. The methyl ether of 1-5 can be cleaved with boron tribromide (BBr3), in an inert solvent, preferably CH2Cl2, or with ethanethiol (EtSH) and aluminum trichloride (AICl3) in an inert solvent, such as CH2Cl2- Other useful methods for removal of methyl ether protecting groups are described in Greene, "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis." (published by Wiley-Interscience). The resulting phenol 1-6 is reacted with 6-(methylamino)-2-pyridylethanol in a Mitsunobu-type coupling reaction (Organic Reactions 1992,42, 335-656; Synthesis 1981, 1-28) to afford 1-7. The reaction is mediated by the complex formed between an azodicarboxylate diester, such as diethyl azodicarboxylate or diisopropyl azodicarboxylate, and triphenylphosphine, and is .   conducted in an aprotic solvent, for instance THF, CH2Cl2, or DMF. The ethyl ester of 1-7 is hydrolyzed using aqueous base, for example, LiOH in aqueous THF or NaOH in aqueous methanol or ethanol, and the intermediate carboxylate salt is acidified with a suitable acid, for instance TFA or HC1, to afford the carboxylic acid 1-8. Alternatively, the intermediate carboxylate salt can be isolated, if desired, or a carboxylate salt of the free carboxylic acid can be prepared by methods well-known to those of skill in the art.<br>

A halophenol derivative, for instance 4-bromophenol (II-l), is converted to a suitably protected derivative, for instance 4-bromo-I-(triisopropylsilyloxy)benzene (II-2). The protecting group for the phenol must be compatible with subsequent chemistry, and also must be able to be removed selectively when desired. Methods for the protection of phenols are described in standard reference volumes, such as Greene, "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis" (published by Wiley-Interscience).

3-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-3-butenoate in a Heck-type reaction (see Heck, Org. Reactions 1982, 27, 345) to afford II-3. The reaction is mediated by a palladium(O) species, and generally is conducted in an inert solvent, such as CH3CN, propionitrile, or toluene, in the presence of an appropriate acid scavenger, such as triethylamine (Et3N) or 5      diisopropyiethylamine ((i-Pr)2NEt). Typical sources of the palladium(O) species include palladium (II) acetate (Pd(OAc)2) and palladium(H) chloride (PdCl2), and oftentimes phosphine ligands, for instance triphenylphosphine (PPh3) or tri-ortho-tolylphosphine (P(tol)3), are included. The α,β-unsaturated ester II-3 is reduced to the saturated compound II-4 by reaction with hydrogen gas in the presence of a suitable catalyst,<br>
l0     preferably palladium metal on activated carbon (Pd/C), in an inert solvent, generally<br>
MeOH, EtOH, EtOAc, or mixtures thereof. The carboxylic acid of II-4 is converted to an activated form using, for example, EDC and HOBt, SOCl2, or 1,1 -carbonyldiimidazole (CDI), and the activated form is subsequently reacted with an appropriate amine, for instance serine benzyi ester, in a suitable solvent, such as DMF, to afford II-5. Depending on whether acid neutralization is required, an added base, such as triethylamine (Et3N), diisopropyiethylamine ((i-Pr)2NEt), or pyridine, may be used. Many additional methods for converting a carboxylic acid to an amide are known, and can be found in standard reference books, such as "Compendium of Organic Synmetic Methods", Vol. I - VI (published by Wiley-Interscience), or Bodansky, "The Practice of Peptide Synthesis"       (published by Springer-Verlag). II-5 is then converted to the oxazole derivative II-7. Several methods are known for the conversion of amidoalcohols to oxazoles (Meyers, Tetrahedron 1994, 50, 2297-2360; Wipf, /. Org. Chem. 1993,58, 3604-3606). For example, the amidoalcohol II-5 can be converted first to the oxazoline II-6. This transformation is generally accomplished under dehydrating conditions, such as reaction with Burgess reagent in THF. Oxazoline II-6 is then oxidized to oxazole II-7 using, for instance, bromtrichloromethane and DBU in CH2CI2 (Williams, Tetrahedron Letters 1997, 38,331-334) or CuBr2 and DBU in an appropriate solvent, such as EtOAc/CHCl3 or CH2C12 (Banish, J. Org. Chem. 1993,58,4494-4496). Removal of the silyl protecting group under standard fluoride conditions (see Greene above) affords phenol II-8, which is<br>
30      converted to the tert-butyloxy carbonate derivative II-9 using di-tert-butyl dicarbonate in the presence of a base, generally pyridine, in a polar, neutral solvent, such as THF. This new protecting group is selected as described above. Compound II-9 is converted to the carboxylic acid derivative 11-10 by hydrogenation as described above, and 11-10 is converted to amide 11-11 according to the general procedure of Carpino and Ayman (J. Am.<br>
35      Chem. Soc. 1995,117, 5401-5402). Under these conditions, carboxylic acid 11-10 is reacted with a suitable amine, for instance N-methylaniline, in the presence of bis(tetramethylene)fluoroformamidinium hexafluorophosphate (BPFFH) and an appropriate<br><br>
WO 01/17959	PCT/US00/24514<br>
base, generally Et3N, (i-Pr)2NEt, pyridine, or mixtures thereof, in a polar, neutral solvent, such as DMF. The tert-butyloxy carbamate protecting group is removed under standard acidic conditions (see Greene above), and the resulting phenol 11-12 is converted to 11-14 by the methods described in Scheme I.<br>

Thiazole derivative III-3 is prepared by condensation of 2-cyanoacetamide (III-l) and 3-bromo-l,l,l-trifluoroacetone (III-2) in refluxing ethanol, by appropriate modification of the procedure of Schaefer and Gewald (j. Prakt. Chem.1974,316, 684-692) for the preparation of 4-phenyl-2-(cyanomethyl)thiazole. Aldol condensation of III-3<br><br><br>
WO 01/17959	PCT/US00/24514<br>
with an appropriately substituted benzaldehyde derivative, for example 4-(benzyloxy)ben2aldehyde, gives III-4. The reaction is catalyzed by a suitable base, preferably sodium ethoxide, and is conducted in a polar solvent, generally ethanol. Epoxidation of III-4 to afford III-5 is accomplished with sodium hypochlorite in the presence of neutral alumina according to the general method of Foucaud {Synthesis 1987, 9, 854-856). Other well-known epoxidation conditions, such as mCPBA, basic hydrogen peroxide, or basic tert-butyl hydroperoxide, might also be used, as long as the conditions are compatible with the functionality in the substrate. On exposure to triethylsilane in the presence of a suitable Lewis acid, such as BF3 OEt2, or a suitable protic acid, for instance<br>
10      TFA or HCI, the epoxide ring of III-5 is reductively opened in a highly regioselective<br>
manner to afford ketone III-6, together with the corresponding trimethylsilyl cyanohydrin of the III-6. This cyanohydrin is conveniently converted t&amp; ketone III-6 on exposure to tetrabutylammonium fluoride in an appropriate solvent, generally THF. This ketone reacts in a Wittig-type reaction with triethyl phosphonoacetate in the presence of a suitable base,<br>
15     for instance LiN(TMS)2 or NaH, in a polar, aprotic solvent, preferably THF, to afford the α,β-unsaturated ester III-7 as a mixture of olefinic isomers. On reaction with magnesium metal in MeOH, the olefin of III-7 is selectively reduced to afford the saturated derivative III-8. The ethyl ester is converted to a methyl ester under these conditions. Removal of the benzyl group is accomplished with ethanethiol and BF3  OEt2, to afford the phenol III-9, which is converted to IH-10 according to the methods described in Scheme I.<br><br><br>

The<br>

For example, 2-lithio-5-methylthiazole, prepared from 5-methylthiazole and n-butyllithium, reacts with IV-2 in an ethereal solvent, such as THF or DME, to afford the ketone derivative TV-3.

Typical sources of cyanide ion include potassium cyanide (KCN), sodium cyanide<br>
15      (NaCN), and tetrabutylammonium cyanide (BU4NCN). The reaction is frequently<br>
conducted in the presence of a catalytic amount of a Lewis acid, generally Znl2, and a polar, aprotic solvent, such as acetonitrile (CH3CN), is preferred. Other protected<br><br>

cyanohydrins, for instance an ethoxyethyl-protected cyanohydrin, may be used, as long as the protecting group is compatible with subsequent chemistry and can be selectively removed when desired. A discussion of protecting groups can be found in standard reference volumes, such as Greene, "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis" (published by Wiley-Interscience). Compound V-2 is C-alkylated with an appropriate benzyl halide, for example 4-benzyloxybenzyl chloride, to afford V-3. The reaction involves an initial deprotonation to afford an intermediate anion, which is not isolated but rather is reacted in situ with the alkylating agent. Typical bases for this type of reaction include lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) and lithium hexamethyldisilazide (LiN(TMS)2), and polar, aprotic solvents such as THF or DME are preferred. The TBS-cyanohydrin of V-3 is conveniently converted to the ketone V-4 by reaction with tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF). A two step procedure might also be used to effect this transformation. For example, the silyl protecting group of V-3 can be removed under acidic conditions, such as by reaction with HF, to afford a cyanohydrin which can be converted to ketone V-4 by reaction with a suitable base. Compound V-4 is converted to the α,βi-unsaturated ester V-5 through the well-known Wittig reaction. Typically, the reaction is conducted using triethyl phosphonoacetate in the presence of a suitable base, generally sodium hydride (NaH) or LiN(TMS)2, in an aprotic solvent, such as toluene, THF, or mixtures thereof. Reduction of the olefin group of V-5 is optimally accomplished by hydrogenation in the presence of a palladium catalyst, for instance palladium on activated charcoal, in a suitable solvent, such as EtOAc, MeOH, EtOH, i-PrOH, or mixtures thereof. Under these conditions, the benzyl protecting group on the phenol is also removed. The resulting phenol V-6 is reacted with 6-(methylamino)-2-pyridylethanol in a Mitsunobu-type coupling reaction (Organic Reactions 1992, 42, 335-656; Synthesis 1981, 1-28) to afford V-7. The reaction is mediated by the complex formed between an azodicarboxylate diester, such as diethyl azodicarboxylate or diisopropyl azodicarboxylate, and triphenylphosphine, and is typically conducted in an aprotic solvent, for instance THF, CH2Cl2, or DMF. The ethyl ester of V-7 is hydrolyzed using aqueous base, for example, LiOH or NaOH in aqueous dioxane, THF, methanol or ethanol, and the intermediate carboxylate salt is acidified with a suitable acid, for instance TFA or HCl, to afford the carboxylic acid V-8. If desired, the intermediate carboxylate salt can be isolated. In addition, appropriate salts of the carboxylic acid or the amine can be prepared by methods well-known to those of skill in the art.<br><br><br>

The reaction is mediated by a palladium(0) species, and generally is conducted in an inert solvent, such as CH3CN, propionitrile, toluene, or DMF, in the presence of an appropriate acid scavenger, such as triethylamine (Et3N) or diisopropylethylamine ((i-Pr)2NEt). Typical sources of the palladium(O) species include palladium (II) acetate (Pd(OAc)2) and palladium(II) chloride (PdCl2), and oftentimes phosphine ligands, for instance triphenylphosphine (PPI13) or tri-ortho-tolylphosphine (P(toI)3), are included. Compound VI-3 reacts with an organocopper species in a 1,4-addition reaction to give the conjugate addition product VI-4 (see Melnyk, O.; Stephan, E.; Pourcelot, G.; Cresson, P.

Organic Reactions 1972, 79, 1-113; Lipshutz, B. Organic Reactions 1992,41, 135-631).

For example, treatment of VI-4 with<br>

The methyl ether of VI-S can be cleaved with boron tribromide (BBr3), in an inert solvent, preferably CH2CI2, or with ethanethiol (EtSH) and aluminum trichloride (AICI3) in an inert solvent, such as CH2CI2, to afford phenol VI-6.

Amide coupling reagents as used herein denote reagents which may be used to form peptide bonds. Typical coupling methods employ carbodiimides, activated anhydrides and esters and acyl halides. Reagents such as EDC, DCC, DPPA, BOP reagent, HOBt, N-hydroxysuccinimide and oxalyl chloride are typical.<br>
30	Coupling methods to form peptide bonds are generally well known to the art. The<br>
methods of peptide synthesis generally set forth by Bodansky et al., THE PRACTICE OF PEPTIDE SYNTHESIS, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1984, Ali etal. in J. Med. Chenu, 29, 984 (1986) and J. Med. Chem., 30, 2291 (1987) are generally illustrative of the technique and are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
35	Typically, the amine or aniline is coupled via its free amino group to an appropriate<br>
carboxylic acid substrate using a suitable carbodiimide coupling agent, such as N,N" dicyclohexyl carbodiimide (DCC), optionally in the presence of catalysts such as 1-<br><br>
WO 01/17959	PCT/US00/24514<br>
hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) and dimethylamino pyridine (DMAP). Other methods, such as the formation of activated esters, anhydrides or acid halides, of the free carboxyl of a suitably protected acid substrate, and subsequent reaction with the free amine of a suitably protected amine, optionally in the presence of a base, are also suitable. For example, a protected Boc-amino acid or Cbz-amidino benzoic acid is treated in an anhydrous solvent, such as methylene chloride or tetrahydrofuran(THF), in the presence of a base, such as N-methyl morpholine, DMAP or a trialkylamine, with isobutyl chloroformate to form the "activated anhydride", which is subsequently reacted with the free amine of a second protected amino acid or aniline.<br>
10	Useful intermediates for preparing formula (I) compounds in which R2 is a<br>
benzimidazole are disclosed in Nestor et al, J. Med. Chem. 1984,27, 320. Representative methods for preparing benzimidazole compounds useful as intermediates in the present invention are also common to the art and may be found, for instance, in EP-A 0 381 033. Acid addition salts of the compounds are prepared in a standard manner in a<br>
15      suitable solvent from the parent compound and an excess of an acid, such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydrofluoric, sulfuric, phosphoric, acetic, trifluoroacetic, maleic, succinic or methanesulfonic. Certain of the compounds form inner salts or zwitterions which may be acceptable. Cationic salts are prepared by treating the parent compound with an excess of an alkaline reagent, such as a hydroxide, carbonate or alkoxide, containing the appropriate<br>
20     cation; or with an appropriate organic amine. Cations such as Li+, Na+, K+, Ca++, Mg++ and NH4+ are specific examples of cations present in pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
This invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition which comprises a compound according to formula (I) and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Accordingly, the compounds of formula (I) may be used in the manufacture of a<br>
25      medicament. Pharmaceutical compositions of the compounds of formula (I) prepared as hereinbefore described may be formulated as solutions or lyophilized powders for parenteral administration. Powders may be reconstituted by addition of a suitable diluent or other pharmaceutically acceptable carrier prior to use. The liquid formulation may be a buffered, isotonic, aqueous solution. Examples of suitable diluents are normal isotonic<br>
30     saline solution, standard 5% dextrose in water or buffered sodium or ammonium acetate<br>
solution. Such formulation is especially suitable for parenteral administration, but may also be used for oral administration or contained in a metered dose inhaler or nebulizer for insufflation. It may be desirable to add excipients such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, gelatin, hydroxy cellulose, acacia, polyethylene glycol, mannitol, sodium chloride or sodium<br>

carriers may be added to enhance or stabilize the composition, or to facilitate preparation of the composition. Solid carriers include starch, lactose, calcium sulfate dihydrate, terra alba, magnesium stearate or stearic acid, talc, pectin, acacia, agar or gelatin. Liquid carriers include syrup, peanut oil, olive oil, saline and water. The carrier may also include a sustained release material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate, alone or with a wax. The amount of solid carrier varies but, preferably, will be between about 20 mg to about 1 g per dosage unit. The pharmaceutical preparations are made following the conventional techniques of pharmacy involving milling, mixing, granulating, and compressing, when necessary, for tablet forms; or milling, mixing and filling for hard gelatin capsule forms. When a liquid carrier is used, the preparation will be in the form of a syrup, elixir, emulsion or an aqueous or non-aqueous suspension. Such a liquid formulation may be administered directly p.o. or filled into a soft gelatin capsule.<br>
For rectal administration, the compounds of this invention may also be combined with excipients such as cocoa butter, glycerin, gelatin or polyethylene glycols and molded into a suppository.<br>
The compounds described herein are antagonists of the vitronectin receptor, and are useful for treating diseases wherein the underlying pathology is attributable to ligand or cell which interacts with the vitronectin receptor. For instance, these compounds are useful for .   the treatment of diseases wherein loss of the bone matrix creates pathology. Thus, the instant compounds are useful for the treatment of ostoeporosis, hyperparathyroidism, Paget"s disease, hypercalcemia of malignancy, osteolytic lesions produced by bone metastasis, bone loss due to immobilization or sex hormone deficiency. The compounds of this invention are also believed to have utility as antitumor, anti-angiogenic, antiinflammatory and anti-metastatic agents, and be useful in the treatment of atherosclerosis and restenosis.<br>
The compound is administered either orally or parenterally to the patient, in a manner such that the concentration of drug is sufficient to inhibit bone resorption, or other such indication. The pharmaceutical composition containing the compound is administered at an oral dose of between about 0.1 to about 50 mg/kg in a manner consistent with the condition of the patient. Preferably the oral dose would be about 0.5 to about 20 mg/kg. For acute therapy, parenteral administration is preferred. An intravenous infusion of the peptide in 5% dextrose in water or normal saline, or a similar formulation with suitable excipients, is most effective, although an intramuscular bolus injection is also useful. Typically, the parenteral dose will be about 0.01 to about 100 mg/kg; preferably between 0.1 and 20 mg/kg.   The compounds are administered one to four times daily at a level to achieve a total daily dose of about 0.4 to about 400 mg/kg/day. The precise level and method by which the compounds are administered is readily determined by one routinely<br><br>

The pharmaceutical composition may be formulated with both the compound of formula (I) and the antineoplastic agent in the same container, but formualtion in different containers is preferred. When both agents are provided in solution form, they can be contained in an infusion/injection system for simultaneous administration or in a tandem arrangement.<br>
For convenient administration of the compound of formula (I) and the antineoplastic agent at the same or different times, a kit is prepared, comprising, in a single<br>
lp     container, such as a box, carton or other container, individual bottles, bags, vials or other containers each having an effective amount of the compound of formula (I) for parenteral administration, as described above, and an effective amount of the antineoplastic agent for parenteral administration, as described above. Such kit can comprise, for example, both pharmaceutical agents in separate containers or the same container, optionally as lyophilized plugs, and containers of solutions for reconstitution. A variation of this is to include the solution for reconstitution and the lyophilized plug in two chambers of a single container, which can be caused to admix prior to use. With such an arrangement, the antineoplastic agent and the compound of this invention may be packaged separately, as in two containers, or lyophilized together as a powder and provided in a single container.<br>
20	When both agents are provided in solution form, they can be contained in an<br>
infusion/injection system for simultaneous administration or in a tandem arrangement. For example, the compound of formula (I) may be in an i.v. injectable form, or infusion bag linked in series, via tubing, to the antineoplastic agent in a second infusion bag.

30     Solid-Phase [3H]-SK&amp;F-107260 Binding toαvβ3. Human placenta or human platelet αvβ3 (0.1-0.3 mg/mL) in buffer T (containing 2 mM CaCl2 and 1% octylglucoside) was diluted with buffer T containing 1 mM CaCl2. 1 mM MnCl2, 1 mM MgCl2 (buffer A) and 0.05% NaN3, and then immediately added to 96-well ELISA plates (Corning, New York, NY) at 0.1 mL per well. 0.1 - 0.2 ug of avp3 was added per well. The plates were<br>
35      incubated overnight at 4°C. At the time of the experiment, the wells were washed once with buffer A and were incubated with 0.1 mL of 3.5% bovine serum albumin in the same<br><br><br>
WO 01/17959	PCT/US00/24514<br>
buffer for 1 hr at room temperature. Following incubation the wells were aspirated<br>
completely and washed twice with 0.2 mL buffer A.<br>
Compounds were dissolved in 100% DMSO to give a 2 mM stock solution, which was diluted with binding buffer (15 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 1      mM MnCl2, 1 mM MgCl2) to a final compound concentration of 100 µM. This solution is then diluted to the required final compound concentration. Various concentrations of unlabeled antagonists (0.001 - 100 uM) were added to the wells in triplicates, followed by the addition of 5.0 nM of [3H]-SK&amp;F-107260 (65 - 86 Ci/mmol).<br>
The plates were incubated for 1 hr at room temperature. Following incubation the<br>
10	wells were aspirated completely and washed once with 0.2 mL of ice cold buffer A in a<br>
well-to-well fashion. The receptors were solubilized with 0.1 mL of 1% SDS and the<br>
bound [3H] -SK&amp;F-107260 was determined by liquid scintillation counting with the<br>
addition of 3 mL Ready Safe in a Beckman LS Liquid Scintillation Counter, with 40%<br>
efficiency. Nonspecific binding of [3HJ-SK&amp;F-107260 was determined in the presence of<br>
15      2 uM SK&amp;F-107260 and was consistently less than 1% of total radioligand input. The IC50 (concentration of the antagonist to inhibit 50% binding of [3H]-SK&amp;F-107260) was determined by a nonlinear, least squares curve-fitting routine, which was modified from the LUNDON-2 program. The Kj (dissociation constant of the antagonist) was calculated according to the equation: Kj = IC50/O + L/Kd), where L and Kd were the concentration<br>
20	and the dissociation constant of [3H]-SK&amp;F-107260, respectively.<br>
Compounds of the present invention inhibit vitronectin binding to SK&amp;F 107260 in the concentration range of about 0.060 to about 0.0005 micomolar.<br>
Compounds of this invention are also tested for in vitro and in vivo bone resorption<br>

formation assay disclosed in EP 528 587, which may also be performed using human osteoclasts in place of rat osteoclasts, and the ovarectomized rat model, described by Wronski et aL, Cells and Materials 1991, Sup. 1, 69-74.<br>
30	Vascular smooth muscle cell migration assay<br>
Rat or human aortic smooth muscle cells were used. The cell migration was monitored in a Transwell cell culture chamber by using a polycarbonate membrane with pores of 8 um (Costar). The lower surface of the filter was coated with vitronectin. Cells were suspended in DMEM supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin at a<br>
3	5      concentration of 2.5 - 5.0 x 106 cells/mL, and were pretreated with test compound at<br>
various concentrations for 20 min at 20°C. The solvent alone was used as control. 0.2 mL of the cell suspension was placed in the upper compartment of the chamber. The lower<br><br>
WO 01/17959	PCT/US00/24514<br>
compartment contained 0.6 mL of DMEM supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin. Incubation was carried out at 37°C in an atmosphere of 95% air/5% CO2 for 24 hr. After incubation, the non-migrated cells on the upper surface of the filter were removed by gentle scraping. The filter was then fixed in methanol and stained with 10% Giemsa stain. Migration was measured either by a) counting the number of cells that had migrated to the lower surface of the filter or by b) extracting the stained cells with 10% acetic acid followed by determining the absorbance at 600 nM.<br>
Thyroparathyroidectomized rat model<br>
l0	Each experimental group consists of 5-6 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-400g body<br>
weight). The rats are thyroparathyroidectomized (by the vendor, Taconic Farms) 7 days prior to use. All rats receive a replacement dose of thyroxine every 3 days. On receipt of the rats, circulating ionized calcium levels are measured in whole blood immediately after it has been withdrawn by tail venipuncture into heparinized tubes. Rats are included if the ionized Ca level<br>
