				<td>NUCLEIC ACID COMPOSITIONS FOR STIMULATING IMMUNE RESPONSES<br>
A COMPOSITION COMPRISING AN IMMUNOSTIMULATORY NUCLEIC ACID<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to immnunostimulatory nucleic acids,<br>
compositions thereof and methods of using the immunostimulatory nucleic acids.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Bacterial DNA has immune stimulatory effects to activate B cells and natural killer<br>
cells, but vertebrate DNA does not (Tokunaga, T., et al., 1988. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 79:682-<br>
686; Tokunaga, T., et al., 1984, JNCJ 72:955-962; Messina, J.P., et al., 1991, J. Immunol.<br>
147:1759-1764; and reviewed in Krieg, 1998, In: Applied Oligonucleotide Technology, C.A.<br>
Stein and A.M. Krieg, (Eds.), John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York, NY, pp. 431-448). It is<br>
cow understood that these immune stimulatory effects of bacterial DNA are a result, of the<br>
presence of unruethylated CpG dinucleotides in particular base contexts (CpG motifs), which<br>
are common in bacterial DNA, but methylated and underrepresented in vertebrate DNA<br>
( Krieget al, 1995 Nature 374:546-549; Krieg, 1999 Biochim. Biophys. Acta 93321:1-10).<br>
The immune stimulatory effects of bacterial DNA can be mimicked wrth synthetic<br>
oegdeoxynud.eotides (ODN) containing these CpG motifs. Such CpG- GDN have highly<br>
stimulatory effects on human and murinc leukocytes, inducing B cell proliferation; eytokms<br>
and irmnunoglobulin secretion; natural killer (NK) cell lytic activity and IFN-? secretion; and<br>
activation of dendritic cells (DCs) and other antigen presenting cells to express costimulatory<br>
mdcxules and sscreie cytokines, especially the Th1-like cytokines that are important in<br>
pronioting the development of Thl-like T cell responses.<br>
These immune stimulatory effects of native phosphodiester backbone CpG ODN are<br>
ulghly CpG specific in that the effects are essentially abolished if the CpG motif is<br>
methylated, changed to a GpC, or otherwise eliminated or altered (Krieg et al, 1995 Nature<br>
374:546-549; Hartmann et al, 1999 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA 96:9305-10). Phosphodiester<br>
CpO ODN can be formulated in lipids, alum, or other types of vehicles with depot properties<br>
or improved cell uptake in order to enhance the immune stimulatory effects (Yamamoto et al,<br>
1994 Microbiol. Immunol. 38:831-836; Gramzinski et al, 1998 Mol. Med. 4:109-118).<br>
In early studies, it was thought that the immune stimulatory CpG motif followed the<br>
formula purine-purme-CpG-pyrmidine-pyrhnidhine (Krieg et al, 1995 Nature 374:546-549;<br>
Pisetsky, 1996 J. Immunol. 156:421-423; Hacker et al., 1998 EMBO J. 17:6230-6240;<br>
Lipford et al, 1998 Trends in Microbiol. 6:496-500). However, it is now clear that mouse<br>
lymphocytes respond quite well to phosphodiester CpG motifs that do not follow this<br>
"formula" (Yi et al., 1998 J. Immunol. 160:5898-5906) and the same is true of human B cells<br>
and dendritic cells (Hartmann et al, 1999 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA 96:9305-10; Liang, 1996<br>
J. Clin. Invest. 98:1119-1129).<br>
Several past investigators have looked at whether the nucleotide content of ODN may<br>
have effects independently of the sequence of the ODN. Interestingly, antisense ODN have<br>
been found to be generally enriched in the content of GG, CCC, CC, CAC, and CG<br>
sequences, while having reduced frequency of TT or TCC nucleotide sequences compared to<br>
what would be expected if base usage were random (Smetsers et al., 1996 Antisense Nucleic<br>
Acid Drug Develop. 6:63-67). This raised the possibility that the over-represented sequences<br>
may comprise preferred targeting elements for antisense oligonucleotides or visa versa. One<br>
reason to avoid the use of thymidine-rich ODN for antisense experiments is that degradation<br>
of the ODN by nucleases present in cells releases free thymidine which competes with 3H-<br>
thynvidine which is frequently used in experiments to assess cell proliferation (Matson et al.,<br>
1992 Antisense Research and Development 2:325-330).<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The invention is based in part on the surprising discovery of new families of nucleic<br>
acids that induce higher levels of immune stimulation than previously known nucleic acids.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
It was known in the prior art that CpG containing nucleic acids stimulate the immune<br>
10 system, and that can thereby be used to treat cancer, infectious diseases, allergy, asthma and<br>
other disorders, and to help protect against opportunistic infections following cancer<br>
chemotherapies. The strong yet balanced, cellular and humoral immune responses that result<br>
from CpG stimulation reflect the body's own natural defense system against invading<br>
pathogens and cancerous cells. CpG sequences, while relatively rare in human DNA, are<br>
15 commonly found in the DNA of infectious organisms such as bacteria. The human immune<br>
system has apparently evolved to recognize CpG sequences as an early warning sign of<br>
infection, and to initiate an immediate and powerful immune response against invading<br>
pathogens without causing adverse reactions frequently seen with other immune stimulatory<br>
agents. Thus, CpG containing nucleic acids, relying on this innate immune defense<br>
20 mechanism, can utilize a unique and natural pathway for immune therapy.<br>
The effects of CpG nucleic acids on immune modulation were discovered by the<br>
inventor of the instant patent application and have been described extensively in co-pending<br>
patent applications, such as U.S. Patent Application Serial Nos: 08/386,063 filed on 02/07/95<br>

The invention is based, in part, on the unexpected discovery of several families of<br>
nucleic acids that are more immunostimulatory than previously reported CpG nucleic acids.<br>
Each family is represented by a particularly immunostimulatory nucleic acid. These nucleic<br>
acid families and their representative members are described in more detail below.<br>
ODN 10102 Family:<br>
5 This family of nucleic acids comprises the nucleotide sequence having the formula of<br>
5'X1X2X3X4X5X6X7 TTCGTCGTTTCGTCGTT 3' (SEQIDNO:3)<br>
wherein X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, X6 and X7 are independently selected residues that may be<br>
selected from the group of nucleotides consisting of adenosine, guanosine, thymidine, and<br>
cytosine. In some embodiments, there may be no flanking residues. Such a nucleic acid<br>
10 would comprise a nucleotide sequence of 5 'IT CGT CGT TTC GTC GTT 3' (SEQ ID<br>
NO:4).<br>
In other embodiments, the nucleic acid may lack X1; X1 and X2; X1, X2 and X3; X1,<br>
X2, X3 and X4; or X1, X2, X3, X4 and X5, or may lack X1 through to X6 or may lack X1<br>
through to X7.<br>
15 In one embodiment, X1 is a thymidine, and /or X2 is cytosine, and/or X3 is a guanosine,<br>
and/or X4 is a thymidine, and/or X5 is a cytosine, and/or X6 is a guanosine, and/or X1 is a<br>
thymidine. Those of ordinary skill in the art will be able to determine the sequence of the<br>
remaining nucleic acids belonging to this family.<br>
The nucleic acids of this family are generally at least 17 nucleotides in length. In<br>
20 some embodiments, the nucleic acids are at least 19, at least 20, at least 21, at least 22, at least<br>
23, and at least 24 nucleotides in length. In a preferred embodiment, the nucleic acids are 24<br>
nucleotides in length. In still further embodiments, the nucleic acids are more than 24<br>
nucleotides in length. Examples include nucleic acids that are at least 50, at least 75, at least<br>
100, at least 200, at least 500, at least 1000 nucleotides in length, or longer. Preferably, the<br>
25 nucleic acids are 17-100, and more preferably 24-100 nucleotides in length.<br>
All the nucleic acids of this first family contain at least three CpG motifs. These<br>
nucleic acids may contain four or five or more CpG motifs. The CpG motifs may be<br>
contiguous to each other, or alternatively, they may be spaced apart from each other at<br>
constant or random distances.<br>
30 The nucleic acids of this family also contain an overrepresentation of thymidine<br>
nucleotides. These nucleic acids may contain greater than 60%, less than 60%, or less than<br>
55% thymidines.<br>
The invention is further premised, in part, on the unexpected discovery of another<br>
family of nucleic acids that is more immunostimulatory than previously reported CpG nucleic<br>
acids. This family of nucleic acids comprises the nucleotide sequence having the formula of<br>
5' TCG TCGTTT CGT CGT TTC X1X2X3X4 X5 X6 3' (SEQ ID NO:5)<br>
J wherein X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, and X6 are independently selected residues that may be selected<br>
from the group of nucleotides consisting of adenosine, guanosine, thymidine, and cytosine. In<br>
some embodiments, there may be no flanking residues. As an example, the nucleic acid may<br>
comprise a nucleotide sequence of 5' TCG TCG TTT CGT CGT TTC 3' (SEQ ID NO:6).<br>
In other embodiments, the nucleic acid may lack X6; X6 and X5; or X6, X5, and X4; X6<br>
10 through to X3; X6 through to X2; or X6 through to X1.<br>
In one embodiment, X1 is a cytosine. In another embodiment, X2 is guanosine. In<br>
another embodiment, X3 is a thymidine. In another embodiment, X4 is a thymidine. Those of<br>
ordinary skill in the art will be able to determine the sequence of the remaining nucleic acids<br>
belonging to this family.<br>
15 The nucleic acids of this latter family are generally at least 18 nucleotides in length.<br>
In some embodiments, the nucleic acids are at least 20, at least 22, at least 23, and at least 24<br>
nucleotides in length. In a preferred embodiment, the nucleic acids are 24 nucleotides in<br>
length. In still further embodiments, the nucleic acids are more than 24 nucleotides in length.<br>
Examples include nucleic acids that are at least 50, at least 75, at least 100, at least 200, at<br>
20 least 500, at least 1000 nucleotides in length, or longer. Preferably, the nucleic acids are 18-<br>
100, and more preferably 24-100 nucleotides in length.<br>
All the nucleic acids of this second family contain at least four CpG motifs. These<br>
nucleic acids may contain five or more CpG motifs, depending upon the embodiment. The<br>
CpG motifs may be contiguous to each other, or alternatively, they may be spaced apart from<br>
25 each other at constant or random distances.<br>
The nucleic acids of this family also contain an overrepresentation of thymidine<br>
nucleotides. These nucleic acids may contain greater than 60%, less than 60%, or less than<br>
55% thymidines.<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides a nucleic acid comprising the nucleotide<br>
10 sequence of TCG TCG TTT CGT CGT TTC GTC GTT (SEQ ID NO: 1) (ODN 10102). As<br>
described in greater detail in the Examples, this nucleic acid was identified only after<br>
screening a multitude of nucleic acids for those having similar or greater immunostimulatory<br>
activity than previously identified irnmunostirnulatory nucleic acids. More specifically, the<br>
nucleic acids were compared to a nucleic acid having a nucleotide sequence of TCG TCG<br>
TTT TGT CGT TTT GTC GTT (SEQ ID NO:2) that was previously shown to be<br>
immunostimulatory. The nucleic acid comprising SEQ ID NO:1 was identified only after<br>
5 screening approximately 165 nucleic acids for those having immunostimulatory capacity<br>
greater than that of nucleic acids comprising SEQ ID NO:2. The difference in activity is<br>
surprising because there is only a minimal difference between SEQ ID NO: I and SEQ ID<br>
NO:2 (i.e., a difference in two nucleotides). It was unexpected that such a minimal change in<br>
sequence would result in a statistically significant increase in immunostimulation.<br>

sequences are provided: 5' TCG TCG TTT CGT CGT TTC GTC GT 3' (SEQ ID NO:7); 5'<br>

such as poly T motifs, poly G motifs, TG motifs, poly A motifs, poly C motifs, and the like,<br>
provided that the core sequences of SEQ ID NO:4 and SEQ ID NO:6 are present. These<br>

The nucleic acids of this family also contain an overrepresentation of thymidine<br>
nucleotides. These nucleic acids may contain at least 60%, at least 55%, or at least 50%<br>
25 thymidines.<br>
The invention is further premised, in part, on the unexpected discovery of another<br>
family of nucleic acids that is as immunostimulatory as previously reported CpG nucleic<br>
acids. This family of nucleic acids comprises the nucleotide sequence having the formula of<br>

30 wherein X1 through X9 are independently selected residues that may be selected from the<br>

embodiments, there may be no flanking residues. As an example, the nucleic acid may<br>

ordinary skill in the art will be able to determine the sequence of the remaining nucleic<br>
JO acids belonging to this family.<br>
The nucleic acids of this family are generally at least 12 nucleotides in length. In<br>
some embodiments, the nucleic acids are at least 15, at least 18, and at least 21 nucleotides<br>
in length. In a preferred embodiment, the nucleic acids are 21 nucleotides in length. In still<br>
further embodiments, the nucleic acids are more than 21 nucleotides in length. Examples<br>
15 include nucleic acids that are at least 50, at least 75, at least 100, at least 200, at least 500,<br>

25 In another aspect, the invention provides a nucleic acid comprising the nucleotide<br>
sequence of TCG TCG TTT TTC GGT CGT TTT (SEQ ID NO:19) (ODN 10103). As<br>
described in greater detail in the Examples, this nucleic acid was identified only after<br>

 More specifically, the nucleic acids were compared to a nucleic acid having a nucleotide<br>
sequence of TCG TCG TTT TGT CGT TTT GTC GTT (SEQ ID NO:2) that was previously<br>
shown to be immunostimulatory. The nucleic acid comprising SEQ ID NO: 19 was identified<br>
only after screening approximately 165 nucleic acids for those having immunostimulatory<br>
capacity similar to or greater than that of nucleic acids comprising SEQ ID NO:2. The<br>
difference in activity is surprising because there is only a minimal difference between SEQ ID<br>
5 NO:19 and SEQ ID NO:2 (i.e., SEQ ID NO:19 includes three additional internal nucleotides<br>
(i.e., TCG), and lacks six 3' nucleotides as compared to SEQ ID NO:2). It was unexpected<br>
that such a change in sequence would result in an increase in immunostimulation.<br>

In other embodiments, the nucleic acid may lack X5; X5 and X4; X5, X4 aad X3; X3<br>
through X2; and X5 through X1.<br>
5 In various embodiments, X1 is a thymidine, and/or X2is thymidine, and/or X3 is a<br>
cytosine, and/or X4 is a guanosine, and/or X5 is an adenine. Those of ordinary skill in the<br>
art will be able to determine the sequence of the remaining nucleic acids belonging to this<br>
family.<br>
The nucleic acids of this family are generally at least 19 nucleotides in length. In<br>
10 some embodiments, the nucleic acids are at least 20, at least 22, and at least 24 nucleotides<br>
in length. In a preferred embodiment, the nucleic acids are 24 nucleotides in length. In still<br>
further embodiments, the nucleic acids are more than 24 nucleotides in length. Examples<br>
include nucleic acids that are at least 50, at least 75, at least 100, at least 200, at least 500,<br>
at least 1000 nucleotides in length, or longer. Preferably, the nucleic acids are 19-100, and<br>
15 more preferably 24-100 nucleotides in length.<br>
All the nucleic acids of this second family contain at least three CpG motifs. These<br>
nucleic acids may contain four or more CpG motifs, depending upon the embodiment. The<br>
CpG motifs may be contiguous to each other, or alternatively, they may be spaced apart<br>
from each other at constant or random distances.<br>
20 The nucleic acids of this family also contain an overrepresentation of thymidine<br>
nucleotides. These nucleic acids may contain at least 60%, at least 55%, or at least 50%<br>
thymidines.<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides a nucleic acid comprising the nucleotide<br>
sequence of TCG TCG TTT TGT CGT TTT TTT CGA (SEQ ID NO: 118) (ODN 10105).<br>
25 As described in greater detail in the Examples, this nucleic acid was identified only after<br>
screening a multitude of nucleic acids for those having similar or greater<br>
immunostimulatory activity than previously identified immunostimulatory nucleic acids.<br>
More specifically, the nucleic acids were compared to a nucleic acid having a nucleotide<br>
sequence of TCG TCG TTT TGT CGT TTT GTC GTT (SEQ ID NO:2) that was previously<br>
30 shown to be immunostimulatory. The nucleic acid comprising SEQ ID NO: 118 was<br>
identified only after screening approximately 165 nucleic acids for those having<br>
immunostimulatory capacity similar to or greater than that of nucleic acids comprising SEQ<br>
ID NO:2. The difference in activity is surprising because there is 79% identity between SEQ<br>
ID NO:118 and SEQ ID NO:2 (i.e., five of the last 3' nucleotides differ between SEQ ID<br>
NO: 118 and SEQ ID NO.2). It was unexpected that such a change in sequence would result<br>
5 in an increase in immunostimulation.<br>
In yet other aspects of the invention, nucleic acids having the following nucleotide<br>
sequences are provided: 5' TCG TCG TTT TGT CGT TTT TTT CG 3' (SEQ ID<br>
NO:123); 5' TCG TCG TTT TGT CGT TTT TTT C 3' (SEQ ID NO:124); 5' TCG TCG<br>

These immunostimulatory nucleic acids are capable of activating the innate immune<br>
20 system, and augmenting both humoral and cellular antigen specific responses when co-<br>
administered with an antigen, such as Hepatitis B surface antigen. The Examples provided<br>
herein demonstrate that these nucleic acids can stimulate human immune cells in vitro, and<br>
murine cells in vitro and in vivo. When compared to a sequence known to be a potent<br>
adjuvant, the nucleic acid of SEQ ID NO:118 is found to work as well or better as a vaccine<br>
25 adjuvant.<br>
The nucleic acids of the invention can further contain other immunostimulatory<br>
motifs such as poly T motifs, poly G motifs, TG motifs, poly A motifs, poly C motifs, and<br>
the like, provided that the core sequences of SEQ ID NO: 120 and SEQ ID NO: 122 are<br>
present. These immunostimulatory motifs are described in greater detail below or in U.S.<br>

ODN 10106 Family:<br>
5 This nucleic acid comprises the nucleotide sequence having the formula of<br>
TCG TCG TTT TTC GTG CGT TTT T (SEQ ID NO: 141) (ODN 10106).<br>
The sequence may be flanked by a number of nucleotide residues independently<br>
selected residues that may be selected from the group of nucleotides consisting of adenosine,<br>
guanosine, thymidine, and cytosine.<br>
10 The nucleic acids of this family are at least 22 nucleotides in length. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, the nucleic acids are 22 nucleotides in length. In still further embodiments,<br>
the nucleic acids are more than 22 nucleotides in length. Examples include nucleic acids<br>
that are at least 50, at least 75, at least 100, at least 200, at least 500, at least 1000<br>
nucleotides in length, or longer. Preferably, the nucleic acids are 12-100.<br>
15 All the nucleic acids of this first family contain at least four CpG motifs. These<br>
nucleic acids may contain five or more CpG motifs. The CpG motifs may be contiguous to<br>
each other, or alternatively, they may be spaced apart from each other at constant or<br>
random distances.<br>
The nucleic acids of this family also contain an overrepresentation of thymidine<br>
20 nucleotides. These nucleic acids may contain greater than 60%, less than 60%, or less than<br>
55% thymidines.<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides a nucleic acid consisting of the nucleotide<br>
sequence of TCG TCG TTT TTC GTG CGT TTT T (SEQ ID NO: 141). As described in<br>
greater detail in the Examples, this nucleic acid was identified only after screening a<br>
15 multitude of nucleic acids for those having similar or greater immunostimulatory activity<br>
than previously identified immunostimulatory nucleic acids. More specifically, the nucleic<br>
acids were compared to a nucleic acid having a nucleotide sequence of TCG TCG TTT TGT<br>
CGT TTT GTC GTT (SEQ ID NO:2) that was previously shown to be immunostimulatory.<br>
The nucleic acid comprising SEQ ID NO: 141 was identified only after screening<br>
o approximately 165 nucleic acids for those having immunostimulatory capacity greater than<br>
that of nucleic acids comprising SEQ ID NO:2. The difference in activity is surprising<br>
because there is only a minimal difference between SEQ ID NO:141 and SEQ ID NO:2. It<br>
was unexpected that such a minimal change in sequence would result in a statistically<br>
significant increase in immunostimulation.<br>
The nucleic acids of the invention can further contain other immunostrmulatory<br>
5 motifs such as poly T motifs, poly G motifs, TG motifs, poly A motifs, poly C motifs, and<br>
the like, provided that the core sequence of SEQ ID NO: 141 is present. These<br>

10 It is to be understood that any embodiments recited herein apply equally to the nucleic<br>
acids provided herein. Thus, if an embodiment refers to, for example, SEQ ID NO:1, it is to<br>
be understood that it applies equally to SEQ ID NO:19, SEQ ID NO:45, SEQ ID NO:118 and<br>
SEQE)NO:141.<br>
The CpG motifs of the nucleic acids described herein are preferably unmethylated.<br>
15 An unmetibylated CpG motif is an unmethylated cytosine-guanine dinucleotide sequence (i.e.<br>
an unmethylated 5' cytosine followed by 3' guanosine and linked by a phosphate bond). All<br>
the nucleic acid described herein are immunostimulatory. In some embodiments of the<br>
invention, the CpG motifs are methylated. A methylated CpG motif is a methylated cytosine-<br>
guanine dinucleotide sequence (i.e., a methylated 5' cytosine followed by a 3' guanosine and<br>
20 linked by a phosphate bond).<br>
A CpG nucleic acid is a nucleic acid that comprises the formula<br>
5' X1 X2CGX3 X4 3'<br>
wherein C is unmethylated, wherein X1X2 and X3X4 are nucleotides. In a related<br>
embodiment, the 5' X1 X2CGX3 X4 3' sequence is a non-palindromic sequence. In certain<br>

and CpA. In more particular embodiments, X1X2 are nucleotides selected from the group<br>
consisting of GpA and GpT; and X3X4 are TpT. In yet other embodiments, X1X2 are both<br>
30 purines and X3X4 are both pyrimidines. In another embodiment, X2 is a T and X3 is a<br>
pyrimidine. Examples of CpG nucleic acids are described in U.S. Non-Provisional Patent<br>

A T-rich nucleic acid is a nucleic acid which includes at least one poly T sequence<br>
and/or which has a nucleotide composition of greater than 25% T nucleotide residues. A<br>
5 nucleic acid having a poly-T sequence includes at least four Ts in a row, such as 5'TTTT3Preferably a T-rich nucleic acid includes more than one poly T sequence. In preferred<br>
embodiments the T-rich nucleic acid may have 2, 3,4, etc poly T sequences. Other T-rich<br>
nucleic acids according to the invention have a nucleotide composition of greater than 25% T<br>
nucleotide residues, but do not necessarily include a poly T sequence. In these T-rich nucleic<br>
10 acids the T nucleotide resides may be separated from one another by other types of nucleotide<br>
residues, i.e., G, C, and A. In some embodiments the T-rich nucleic acids have a nucleotide<br>
composition of greater than 35%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, and 99%, T nucleotide<br>
residues and every integer % in between. Preferably the T-rich nucleic acids have at least one<br>
poly T sequence and a nucleotide composition of greater than 25% T nucleotide residues.<br>
15 Poly G nucleic acids preferably are nucleic acids having the following formulas:<br>
wherein X1, X2, X3, and X4 are nucleotides. In preferred embodiments at least one of X3 and X4<br>
are a G. In other embodiments both of X3 and X4 area G. In yet other embodiments the<br>
preferred formula is 5' GGGNGGG3', or 5' GGGNGGGNGGG3' wherein N represents<br>
20 between 0 and 20 nucleotides.<br>
A C-rich nucleic acid is a nucleic acid molecule having at least one or preferably at<br>
least two poly-C regions or which is composed of at least 50% C nucleotides. A poly-C<br>
region is at least four C residues in a row. Thus a poly-C region is encompassed by the<br>
formula 5'CCCC 3'. In some embodiments it is preferred that the poly-C region have the<br>
25 formula 5'CCCCCC 3'. Other C-rich nucleic acids according to the invention have a<br>
nucleotide composition of greater than 50% C nucleotide residues, but do not necessarily<br>
include a poly C sequence. In these C-rich nucleic acids the C nucleotide residues may be<br>
separated from one another by other types of nucleotide residues, i.e., G, T, and A. In some<br>
embodiments the C-rich nucleic acids have a nucleotide composition of greater than 60%,<br>
30 70%, 80%, 90%, and 99%, C nucleotide residues and every integer % in between. Preferably<br>
the C-rich nucleic acids have at least one poly C sequence and a nucleotide composition of<br>
greater than 50% C nucleotide residues, and in some embodiments are also T-rich.<br>
The immunostimulatory nucleic acids can be double-stranded or single-stranded.<br>
Generally, double-stranded molecules are more stable in vivo, while single-stranded<br>
molecules have increased immune activity. Thus in some aspects of the invention it is<br>
preferred that the nucleic acid be single stranded and in other aspects it is preferred that the<br>
5 nucleic acid be double stranded.<br>
The terms "nucleic acid" and "oligonucleotide" are used interchangeably herein to<br>
mean multiple nucleotides (i.e. molecules comprising a sugar (e.g. ribose or deoxyribose)<br>
linked to a phosphate group and to an exchangeable organic base, which is either a<br>
substituted pyrimidine (e.g. cytosine (C), thymidine (T) or uracil (U)) or a substituted<br>
10 purine (e.g. adenine (A) or guanine (G)). As used herein, the terms refer to<br>
oligoribonucleotides as well as oligodeoxyribonucleotides. The terms shall also include<br>
polynucleosides (i.e. a polynucleotide minus the phosphate) and any other organic base<br>
containing polymer. Nucleic acid molecules can be obtained from existing nucleic acid<br>
sources (e.g., genomic or cDNA), but are preferably synthetic (e.g. produced by nucleic<br>
15 acid synthesis).<br>
The immunostimulatory oligonucleotides of the instant invention can encompass<br>
various chemical modifications and substitutions, in comparison to natural RNA and DNA,<br>
involving a phosphodiester internucleoside bridge, a p-D-ribose unit and/or a natural<br>
nucleoside base (adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymine, uracil). Examples of chemical<br>
20 modifications are known to the skilled person and are described, for example, in Uhlmann<br>
E et al. (1990) Chem Rev 90:543; "Protocols for Oligonucleotides and Analogs" Synthesis<br>
and Properties &amp; Synthesis and Analytical Techniques, S. Agrawal, Ed, Humana Press,<br>
Totowa, USA 1993; Crooke ST et al. (1996) Amu Rev Pharmacol Toxicol 36:107-129; and<br>
Hunziker J et al. (1995) Mod Synth Methods 7:331-417. An oligonucleotide according to<br>
25 the invention may have one or more modifications, wherein each modification is located at a<br>
particular phosphodiester internucleoside bridge and/or at a particular B-D-ribose unit<br>
and/or at a particular natural nucleoside base position in comparison to an oligonucleotide of<br>
the same sequence which is composed of natural DNA or RNA.<br>
For example, the oligonucleotides may comprise one or more modifications and<br>
 wherein each modification is independently selected from:<br>
a) the replacement of a phosphodiester internucleoside bridge located at the 3' and/or<br>
the 5' end of a nucleoside by a modified internucleoside bridge,<br>
b) the replacement of phosphodiester bridge located at the 3' and/or the 5' end of a<br>
nucleoside by a dephospho bridge,<br>
5 c) the replacement of a sugar phosphate unit from the sugar phosphate backbone by<br>
another unit,<br>
d) the replacement of a p-D-ribose unit by a modified sugar unit, and<br>
e) the replacement of a natural nucleoside base by a modified nucleoside base.<br>
More detailed examples for the chemical modification of an oligonucleotide are as<br>
io follows.<br>
Nucleic acids also include substituted purines and pyrimidines such as C-5 propyne<br>
pyrimidine and 7-deaza-7-subsutituted purine modified bases. Wagner RW et al. (1996) Nat<br>
Biotechnol 14:840-4. Purines and pyrimidines include but are not limited to adenine,<br>
cytosine, guanine, thymidine, 5-methylcytosine, 2-aminopurine, 2-amino-6-chloropurine,<br>
15 2,6-diaminopurine, hypoxanthine, and other naturally and non-naturally occurring<br>
nucleobases, substituted and unsubstituted aromatic moieties. Other such modifications are<br>
well known to those of skill in the art. In all of the foregoing embodiments, an X residue<br>
can also be a non-naturally occurring nucleotide, or a nucleotide analog, such as those<br>
described herein.<br>
20 A modified base is any base which is chemically distinct from the naturally<br>
occurring bases typically found in DNA and RNA such as T, C, G, A, and U, but which<br>
share basic chemical structures with these naturally occurring bases. The modified<br>
nucleoside base may be, for example, selected from hypoxanthine, uracil, dihydrouracil,<br>
pseudouracil, 2-thiouracil, 4-thiouracil, 5-aminouracil, 5-(C1-C6)-alkyluracil, 5-(C2-C6)-<br>
25 alkenyluracil, 5-(C2-C6)-alkynyluracil, 5-(hydroxymethyl)uracil, 5-chlorouracil,<br>
5-fiuorouracil, 5-bromouracil, 5-hydroxycytosine, 5-(C2-C6)-alkylcytosine, 5-(C2-C6)-<br>
alkenylcytosine, 5-(C2-C6)-alkynylcytosine, 5-chlorocytosine, 5-fluorocytosine,<br>
5-bromocytosine, N2-dimethylguanine, 2,4-diamino-purine, 8-azapurine, a substituted<br>
7-deazapurine, preferably 7-deaza-7-substituted and/or 7-deaza-8-substituted purine, 5-<br>
30 hydroxymethylcytosine, N4-alkylcytosme, e.g., N4-ethylcytosine, 5-hydroxydeoxycytidine,<br>
5-hydroxymethyldeoxycytidine, N4-alkyldeoxycytidine, e.g., N4-ethyldeoxycytidine, 6-<br>
thiodeoxyguanosine, and deoxyribonucleosides of nitropyrrole, C5-propynylpyrimidine, and<br>
diaminopurine e.g., 2,6-diaminopurine, inosine, 5-methylcytosine, 2-aminopurine,<br>
2-amino-6-chloropurine, hypoxanthine or other modifications of a natural nucleoside bases.<br>
This list is meant to be exemplary and is not to be interpreted to be limiting.<br>
5 In particular formulas described herein a set of modified bases is defined. For instance<br>
the letter Y is used to refer to a nucleotide containing a cytosine or a modified cytosine. A<br>
modified cytosine as used herein is a naturally occurring or non-naturally occurring<br>
pyrimidine base analog of cytosine which can replace this base without impairing the<br>
immunostimulatory activity of the oligonucleotide. Modified cytosines include but are not<br>
10 limited to 5-substituted cytosines (e.g. 5-methyl-cytosine, 5-fluoro-cytosine, 5-chloro-<br>
cytosine, 5-bromo-cytosine, 5-iodo-cytosine, 5-hydroxy-cytosine, 5-hydroxymethyl-<br>
cytosine, 5-difiuoromethyl-cytosine, and unsubstituted or substituted 5-alkynyl-cytosine), 6-<br>
substituted cytosines, N4-substituted cytosines (e.g. N4-ethyl-cytosine), 5-aza-cytosine, 2-<br>
mercapto-cytosine, isocytosine, pseudo-isocytosine, cytosine analogs with condensed ring<br>
15 systems (e.g. N,N'-propylene cytosine or phenoxazine), and uracil and its derivatives (e.g.<br>
5-fluoro-uracil, 5-bromo-uracil, 5-bromovinyl-uracil, 4-thio-uracil, 5-hydroxy-uracil, 5-<br>
propynyl-uracil). Some of the preferred cytosines include 5-methyl-cytosine, 5-fluoro-<br>
cytosine, 5-hydroxy-cytosine, 5-hydroxymethyl-cytosine, and N4-ethyl-cytosine. In another<br>
embodiment of the invention, the cytosine base is substituted by a universal base (e.g. 3-<br>
20 nitropyrrole, P-base), an aromatic ring system (e.g. fluorobenzene or difiuorobenzene) or a<br>
hydrogen atom (dSpacer). The letter Z is used to refer to guanine or a modified guanine base.<br>
A modified guanine as used herein is a naturally occurring or non-naturally occurring purine<br>
base analog of guanine which can replace this base without impairing the<br>
immunostimulatory activity of the oligonucleotide. Modified guanines include but are not<br>
25 limited to 7-deazaguanine, 7-deaza-7-substituted guanine (such as<br>
7-deaza-7-(C2-C6)alkynylguanine), 7-deaza-8-substituted guanine, hypoxanthine, N2-<br>
substituted guanines (e.g. N2-methyl-guanine), 5-amino-3-methyl-3H,6H-thiazolo[4,5-<br>
d]pyrimidine-2,7-dione, 2,6-diaminopurine, 2-aminopurine, purine, indole, adenine,<br>
substituted adenines (e.g. N6-methyl-adenine, 8-oxo-adenine) 8-substituted guanine (e.g.<br>
30 8-hydroxyguanine and 8-bromoguanine), and 6-thioguanine. In another embodiment of the<br>
invention, the guanine base is substituted by a universal base (e.g. 4-methyl-indole, 5-nitro-<br>
indole, and K-base), an aromatic ring system (e.g. benzimidazole or dichloro-<br>
benzimidazole, l-methyl-lH-[l,2,4]triazole-3-carboxylic acid amide) or a hydrogen atom<br>
(dSpacer).<br>
The oligonucleotides may include modified internucleotide linkages, such as those<br>
5 described in a or b above. These modified linkages may be partially resistant to degradation<br>
(e.g., are stabilized). A "stabilized nucleic acid molecule" shall mean a nucleic acid<br>
molecule that is relatively resistant to in vivo degradation (e.g. via an exo- or endo-<br>
nuclease). Stabilization can be a fimction of length or secondary structure. Nucleic acids<br>
that are tens to hundreds of kilobases long are relatively resistant to in vivo degradation.<br>
W For shorter nucleic acids, secondary structure can stabilize and increase their effect. For<br>
example, if the 3' end of an nucleic acid has self-complementarity to an upstream region, so<br>
that it can fold back and form a sort of stem loop structure, then the nucleic acid becomes<br>
stabilized and therefore exhibits more activity.<br>
Nucleic acid stabilization can also be accomplished via phosphate backbone<br>
15 modifications. Oligonucleotides having phosphorothioate linkages, in some embodiments,<br>
may provide maximal activity and protect the oligonucleotide from degradation by<br>
intracellular exo- and endo-nucleases.<br>
It has been demonstrated that modification of the nucleic acid backbone provides<br>
enhanced activity of nucleic acids when administered in vivo. Constructs having<br>
20 phosphorothioate linkages provide maximal activity and protect the nucleic acid from<br>
degradation by intracellular exo- and endo-nucleases: Other modified nucleic acids include<br>
phosphodiester modified nucleic acids, combinations of phosphodiester and<br>
phosphorothioate nucleic acid, methylphosphonate, methylphosphorothioate,<br>
phosphorodithioate, p-ethoxy, and combinations thereof. Each of these combinations and<br>
25 their particular effects on immune cells is discussed in more detail with respect to CpG<br>
nucleic acids in PCT Published Patent Applications PCT/US95/01570 (WO 96/02555) and<br>
PCT/US97/19791 (WO 98/18810) and in U.S. Patents US 6,194,388 Bl issued February<br>
27, 2001 and US 6,239,116 Bl issued May 29, 2001, the entire contents of which are<br>
hereby incorporated by reference. It is believed that these modified nucleic acids may show<br>
30 more stimulatory activity due to enhanced nuclease resistance, increased cellular uptake,<br>
increased protein binding, and/or altered intracellular localization.<br>
Other stabilized nucleic acids include: nonionic DNA analogs, such as alkyl- and<br>
aryl-phosphates (in which the charged phosphonate oxygen is replaced by an alkyl or aryl<br>
group), phosphodiester and alkylphosphotriesters, in which the charged oxygen moiety is<br>
alkylated. Nucleic acids which contain diol, such as tetraethyleneglycol or<br>
 hexaethyleneglycol, at either or both termini have also been shown to be substantially<br>
resistant to nuclease degradation.<br>
The oligonucleotides may have one or two accessible 5' ends. It is possible to create<br>
modified oligonucleotides having two such 5' ends, for instance, by attaching two<br>
oligonucleotides through a 3'-3' linkage to generate an oligonucleotide having one or two<br>
10 accessible 5' ends. The 3'3'-linkage may be a phosphodiester, phosphorothioate or any<br>
other modified internucleoside bridge. Methods for accomplishing such linkages are known<br>
in the art. For instance, such linkages have been described in Seliger, H. et al.,<br>
Oligonucleotide analogs with terminal 3'-3'- and 5'-5'-internucleotidic linkages as antisense<br>
inhibitors of viral gene expression, Nucleosides &amp; Nucleotides (1991), 10(1-3), 469-77 and<br>
15 Jiang, et al., Pseudo-cyclic oligonucleotides: in vitro and in vivo properties, Bioorganic &amp;<br>
Medicinal Chemistry (1999), 7(12), 2727-2735.<br>
Additionally, 3'3'-linked ODNs where the linkage between the 3'-terminal<br>
nucleosides is not a phosphodiester, phosphorothioate or other modified bridge, can be<br>
prepared using an additional spacer, such as tri- or tetra-ethylenglycol phosphate moiety<br>
20 (Durand, M. et al, Triple-helix formation by an oligonucleotide containing one (dA)12 and<br>
two (dT)12 sequences bridged by two hexaethylene glycol chains, Biochemistry (1992),<br>
31(38), 9197-204, US Patent No. 5658738, and US Patent No. 5668265). Alternatively,<br>
the non-nucleotidic linker may be derived from ethanediol, propanediol, or from an abasic<br>
deoxyribose (dSpacer) unit (Fontanel, Marie Laurence et al., Sterical recognition by T4<br>
25 polynucleotide kinase of non-nucleosidic moieties 5'-attached to oligonucleotides; Nucleic<br>
Acids Research (1994), 22(11), 2022-7) using standard phosphoramidite chemistry. The<br>
non-nucleotidic linkers can be incorporated once or multiple times, or combined with, each<br>
other allowing for any desirable distance between the 3'-ends of the two ODNs to be linked.<br>
A phosphodiester internucleoside bridge located at the 3' and/or the 5' end of a<br>
30 nucleoside can be replaced by a modified internucleoside bridge, wherein the modified<br>
internucleoside bridge is for example selected from phosphorothioate, phosphorodithioate,<br>
NR1R2phosphoramidate, boranophosphate, a-hydroxybenzyl phosphonate, phosphate-(C1-<br>

and/or (C6-C12)arylphosphonate bridges, (C7-C12)-a-hydroxymethyl-aryl (e.g., disclosed in<br>
WO 95/01363), wherein (C6-C12)aryl, (C6-C20)aryl and (C6-C14)aryl are optionally<br>
 substituted by halogen, alkyl, alkoxy, nitro, cyano, and where R1 and R2 are, independently<br>
of each other, hydrogen, (C1-C18)-alkyl, (C6-C20-aryl, (C6-C14)-aryl-(C1-C8)-alkyl,<br>

and R2 form, together with the nitrogen atom carrying them, a 5-6-membered heterocyclic<br>
ring which can additionally contain a further heteroatom from the group O, S and N.<br>
10 The replacement of a phosphodiester bridge located at the 3' and/or the 5' end of a<br>
nucleoside by a dephospho bridge (dephospho bridges are described, for example, in<br>
Uhlmann E and Peyman A in "Methods in Molecular Biology", Vol. 20, "Protocols for<br>
Oligonucleotides and Analogs", S. Agrawal, Ed., Humana Press, Totowa 1993, Chapter<br>
16, pp. 355 ff), wherein a dephospho bridge is for example selected from the dephospho<br>
15 bridges formacetal, 3'-thioformacetal, methylhydroxylamine, oxime, methylenedimethyl-<br>
hydrazo, dimethylenesulfone and/or silyl groups.<br>
The compositions of the invention may optionally be have chimeric backbones. As<br>
used herein, a chimeric backbone is one that comprises more than one type of linkage. In<br>
one embodiment, the chimeric backbone can be represented by the formula: 5' Y1N1ZN2Y2<br>
20 3'. Y1 and Y2 are nucleic acid molecules having between 1 and 10 nucleotides. Y1 and Y2<br>
each include at least one modified internucleotide linkage. Since at least 2 nucleotides of<br>
the chimeric oligonucleotides include backbone modifications these nucleic acids are an<br>
example of one type of "stabilized immunostimulatory nucleic acids."<br>
With respect to the chimeric oligonucleotides, Y1 and Y2 are considered independent<br>
25 of one another. This means that each of Y1 and Y2 may or may not have different<br>
sequences and different backbone linkages from one anther in the same molecule. In some<br>
embodiments Y1 and/or Y2 have between 3 and 8 nucleotides. N1 and N2 are nucleic acid<br>
molecules having between 0 and 5 nucleotides as long as N1ZN2 has at least 6 nucleotides in<br>
total. The nucleotides of N1ZN2 have a phosphodiester backbone and do not include nucleic<br>
30 acids having a modified backbone. Z is an immunostimulatory nucleic acid motif,<br>
preferably selected from those recited herein.<br>
The center nucleotides (N1ZN2) of the formula Y1N1ZN2Y2 have phosphodiester<br>
intemucleotide linkages and Y1 and Y2 have at least one, but may have more than one or<br>
even may have all modified intemucleotide linkages. In preferred embodiments Y1, and/or<br>
Y2 have at least two or between two and five modified intemucleotide linkages or Y1 has<br>
5 two modified intemucleotide linkages and Y2 has five modified intemucleotide linkages or<br>
Y1 has five modified intemucleotide linkages and Y2 has two modified mtemucleotide<br>
linkages. The modified intemucleotide linkage, in some embodiments is a phosphorothioate<br>
modified linkage, a phosphorodithioate modified linkage or a p-ethoxy modified linkage.<br>
The nucleic acids also include nucleic acids having backbone sugars which are<br>
10 covalently attached to low molecular weight organic groups other than a hydroxyl group at<br>
the 2' position and other than a phosphate group at the 5' position. Thus, modified nucleic<br>
acids may include a 2'-O-alkylated ribose group. In addition, modified nucleic acids may<br>
include sugars such as arabinose or 2'-fluoroarabinose instead of ribose. Thus the nucleic<br>
acids may be heterogeneous in backbone composition thereby containing any possible<br>
75 combination of polymer units linked together such as peptide- nucleic acids (which have<br>
amino acid backbone with nucleic acid bases). In some embodiments, the nucleic acids are<br>
homogeneous in backbone composition. Other examples are described in more detail<br>
below.<br>
A sugar phosphate unit (i.e., a P-D-ribose and phosphodiester internucleoside bridge<br>
20 together forming a sugar phosphate unit) from the sugar phosphate backbone (i.e., a sugar<br>
phosphate backbone is composed of sugar phosphate units) can be replaced by another unit,<br>
wherein the other unit is for example suitable to build up a "morpholino-derivative"<br>
oligomer (as described, for example, in Stirchak EP et al. (1989) Nucleic Acids Res<br>
17:6129-41), that is, e.g., the replacement by a morpholino-derivative unit; or to build up a<br>
25 polyamide nucleic acid ("PNA"; as described for example, in Nielsen PE et al. (1994)<br>
Bioconjug Chem 5:3-7), that is, e.g., the replacement by a PNA backbone unit, e.g., by 2-<br>
aminoethylglycine. The oligonucleotide may have other carbohydrate backbone<br>
modifications and replacements, such as peptide nucleic acids with phosphate groups<br>
(PHONA), locked nucleic acids (LNA), and oligonucleotides having backbone sections with<br>
30 aliyl linkers or amino linkers. The alkyl linker may be branched or unbranched, substituted<br>
or unsubstituted, and chirally pure or a racemic mixture.<br>
A p-ribose unit or a p-D-2'-deoxyribose unit can be replaced by a modified sugar<br>
unit, wherein the modified sugar unit is for example selected from p-D-ribose, a-D-2'-<br>
deoxyribose, L-2'-deoxyribose, 2'-F-2'-deoxyribose, 2'-F-arabinose, 2'-O-(C1-C6)alkyl-<br>
ribose, preferably 2'-O-(C1-C6)alkyl-ribose is 2'-O-methylribose, 2'-O-(C2-C6)alkenyl-<br>
J ribose, 2'-[O-(C1-C6)alkyl-O-(C1-C6)alkyl]-ribose, 2'-NH2-2'-deoxyribose, p-D-xylo-<br>
furanose, a-arabinofuranose, 2,4-dideoxy-b-D-erythro-hexo-pyranose, and carbocyclic<br>
(described, for example, in Froehler J (1992) Am Chew. Soc 114:8320) and/or open-chain<br>
sugar analogs (described, for example, in Vandendriessche et al. (1993) Tetrahedron<br>
49:7223) and/or bicyclosugar analogs (described, for example, in Tarkov M et al. (1993)<br>
10 Helv Chim Acta 76:481).<br>
In some embodiments the sugar is 2'-O-methylribose, particularly for one or both<br>
nucleotides linked by a phosphodiester or phosphodiester-like internucleoside linkage.<br>
For use in the instant invention, the oligonucleotides of the invention can be<br>
synthesized de novo using any of a number of procedures well known in the art. For<br>
15 example, the b-cyanoethyl phosphoramidite method (Beaucage, S.L., and Caruthers, M.H.,<br>
Tet. Let. 22:1859, 1981); nucleoside H-phosphonate method (Garegg et al, Tet. Let.<br>
27:4051-4054, 1986; Froehler et al, Nucl. Acid. Res. 14:5399-5407, 1986, ; Garegg etal,<br>
Tet. Let. 27:4055-4058, 1986, Gaffney etal, Tet. Let. 29:2619-2622, 1988). These<br>
chemistries can be performed by a variety of automated nucleic acid synthesizers available<br>
20 in the market. These oligonucleotides are referred to as synthetic oligonucleotides.<br>
Alternatively, T-rich and/or TG dinucleotides can be produced on a large scale in plasmids,<br>
(see Sambrook, T., et al, "Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual", Cold Spring<br>
Harbor laboratory Press, New York, 1989) and separated into smaller pieces or<br>
administered whole. Nucleic acids can be prepared from existing nucleic acid sequences<br>
25 (e.g., genomic or cDNA) using known techniques, such as those employing restriction<br>
enzymes, exonucleases or endonucleases.<br>
Modified backbones such as phosphorothioates may be synthesized using automated<br>
techniques employing either phosphoramidate or H-phosphonate chemistries. Aryl-and<br>
alkyl-phosphonates can be made, e.g., as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,469,863; and<br>
30 alkylphosphotriesters (in which the charged oxygen moiety is alkylated as described in U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,023,243 and European Patent No. 092,574) can be prepared by automated<br>
solid phase synthesis using commercially available reagents. Methods for making other<br>
DNA backbone modifications and substitutions have been described (e.g., Uhhnann, E. and<br>
Peyman, A., Chem. Rev. 90:544, 1990; Goodchild, J., Bioconjugate Chem. 1:165, 1990).<br>
Nucleic acids prepared in this manner are referred to as isolated nucleic acid. An<br>
5 "isolated nucleic acid" generally refers to a nucleic acid which is separated from<br>
components with which it is normally associated in nature. As an example, an isolated<br>
nucleic acid may be one which is separated from a cell, from a nucleus, from mitochondria<br>
or from chromatin.<br>
In the case where the nucleic acid is administered in conjunction with an antigen that<br>
10 is encoded in a nucleic acid vector (as described herein), it is preferred that the backbone of<br>
the nucleic acid be a chimeric combination of phosphodiester and phosphorothioate (or other<br>
phosphate modification). The cell may have a problem taking up a plasmid vector in the<br>
presence of completely phosphorothioate nucleic acid. Thus when both a vector and a nucleic<br>
acid are delivered to a subject, it is preferred that the nucleic acid have a chimeric backbone<br>
15 or have a phosphorothioate backbone but that the plasmid be associated with a vehicle that<br>
delivers it directly into the cell, thus avoiding the need for cellular uptake. Such vehicles are<br>
known in the art and include, for example, liposomes and gene guns.<br>
The invention further embraces the use of any of these foregoing nucleic acids in the<br>
methods recited herein, as well as all previously described and previously known uses of<br>
20 immunostimulatory nucleic acids.<br>
It has been discovered according to the invention that the immunostimulatory nucleic<br>
acids have surprisingly increased immune stimulatory effects. For example, it has been<br>
demonstrated that the nucleic acids described herein are able to provide protection against<br>
infection, probably by generally stimulating the immune system. The Examples illustrate the<br>
25 ability of the nucleic acid having a nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ ID NO:19,<br>
SEQ ID NO:45, SEQ ID NO:118 or SEQ ID NO:141 to protect murine subjects challenged<br>
with Herpes Simplex Virus 2 (HSV-2). The nucleic acid can administered prior to or at the<br>
same time as viral challenge.<br>
The demonstrated ability of these nucleic acids to induce immune stimulation is<br>
30 evidence that the nucleic acids are effective therapeutic agents for vaccination, cancer<br>
immunotherapy, asthma immunotherapy, general enhancement of immune function,<br>
enhancement of hematopoietic recovery following radiation or chemotherapy, and other<br>
immune modulatory applications in humans and other subjects.<br>
The nucleic acids of the invention can be used as stand alone therapies. A stand alone<br>
therapy is a therapy in which a prophylactically or therapeutically beneficial result can be<br>
5 achieved from the administration of a single agent or composition. Accordingly, the nucleic<br>
acids disclosed herein can be used alone in the prevention or treatment of infectious disease,<br>
cancer, and asthma and allergy, because the nucleic acids are capable of inducing immune<br>
responses that are beneficial to the therapeutic outcome of these diseases. Some of the<br>
* methods described herein relate to the use of nucleic acids as a stand alone therapy, while<br>
10 others related to the use of the nucleic acids in combination with other therapeutic agents.<br>
When used in a vaccine, the nucleic acid is administered with an antigen. Preferably,<br>
the antigen is specific for the disorder sought to be prevented or treated. For example, if the<br>
disorder is an infectious disease, the antigen is preferably derived from the infectious<br>
organism (e.g., bacterium, vims, parasite, fungus, etc.). If the disorder is a cancer, the antigen<br>
75 is preferably a cancer antigen.<br>
The immunostimulatory nucleic acids are useful in some aspects of the invention as a<br>
prophylactic vaccine for the prevention of an infection (i.e., an infectious disease), a cancer,<br>
an allergy, or asthma. Preferably, prophylactic vaccination is used in subjects that are not<br>
diagnosed with one of these conditions, and more preferably the subjects are considered at<br>
20 risk of developing one of these conditions. For example, the subject may be one that is at risk<br>
of developing an infection with an infectious organism, or one that is at risk of developing a<br>
cancer in which a specific cancer antigen has been identified, or one that is at risk of<br>
developing an allergy for which an allergen is known, or one that is at risk of developing<br>
asthma where the predisposition to asthma is known.<br>
25 A subject at risk, as used herein, is a subject who has any risk of exposure to an<br>
infection causing pathogen, a carcinogen, or an allergen. A subject at risk also includes<br>
subjects that have a predisposition to developing such disorders. Some predispositions can be<br>
genetic (and can thereby be identified either by genetic analysis or by family history). Some<br>
predispositions are environmental (e.g., prior exposure to carcinogens, etc.) An example of a<br>
30 subject at risk of developing an infection is a subject living in or expecting to travel to an area<br>
where a particular type of infectious agent is or has been found, or it may be a subject who<br>
through lifestyle or medical procedures is exposed to an organism either directly or indirectly<br>
by contact with bodily fluids that may contain infectious organisms. Subjects at risk of<br>
developing infection also include general populations to which a medical agency recommends<br>
vaccination for a particular infectious organism.<br>
If the antigen is an allergen and the subject develops allergic responses to that<br>
5 particular antigen and the subject may be exposed to the antigen, i.e., during pollen season,<br>
then that subject is at risk of exposure to the antigen. A subject at risk of developing an<br>
allergy to asthma includes those subjects that have been identified as having an allergy or<br>
asthma but that don't have the active disease during the immunostimulatory nucleic acid<br>
treatment as well as subjects that are considered to be at risk of developing these diseases<br>
10 because of genetic or environmental factors.<br>
The immunostimulatory nucleic acids can also be given without the antigen or<br>
allergen for shorter term protection against infection, allergy or cancer, and in this case<br>
repeated doses will allow longer term protection.<br>
A subject at risk of developing a cancer is one who is who has a high probability of<br>
15 developing cancer (e.g., a probability that is greater than the probability within the general<br>
public). These subjects include, for instance, subjects having a genetic abnormality, the<br>
presence of which has been demonstrated to have a correlative relation to a likelihood of<br>
developing a cancer that is greater than the likelihood of the general public, and subjects<br>
exposed to cancer causing agents (i.e., carcinogens) such as tobacco, asbestos, or other<br>
20 chemical toxins, or a subject who has previously been treated for cancer and is in apparent<br>
remission. When a subject at risk of developing a cancer is treated with an antigen specific<br>
for the type of cancer to which the subject is at risk of developing and a immunostimulatory<br>
nucleic acid, the subject may be able to kill the cancer cells as they develop. If a tumor begins<br>
to form in the subject, the subject will develop a specific immune response against the tumor<br>
25 antigen.<br>
In addition to the use of the immunostimulatory nucleic acids as a prophylactic, the<br>
invention also encompasses the use of the immunostimulatory nucleic acids for the treatment<br>
of a subject having an infection, an allergy, asthma, or a cancer.<br>
A subject having an infection is a subject that has been exposed to an infectious<br>
30 pathogen and has acute or chronic detectable levels of the pathogen in the body, or in bodily<br>
waste. When used therapeutically, the immunostimulatory nucleic acids can be used as a<br>
stand alone or in combination with another therapeutic agent. For example, the<br>
immunostimulatory nucleic acids can be used therapeutically with an antigen to mount an<br>
antigen specific systemic or mucosal immune response that is capable of reducing the level of,<br>
or eradicating, the infectious pathogen.<br>
An infectious disease, as used herein, is a disease arising from the presence of a<br>
5 foreign microorganism in the body. It is particularly important to develop effective vaccine<br>
strategies and treatments to protect the body's mucosal surfaces, which are the primary site of<br>
pathogenic entry.<br>
As used herein, the term treat, treated, or treating when used with respect to an<br>
infectious disease refers to a prophylactic treatment which increases the resistance of a subject<br>
10 (a subject at risk of infection) to infection with a pathogen or, in other words, decreases the<br>
likelihood that the subject will become infected with the pathogen as well as a treatment after<br>
the subject (a subject who has been infected) has become infected in order to fight the<br>
infection, e.g., reduce or eliminate the infection or prevent it from becoming worse.<br>
A subject having an allergy is a subject that has or is at risk of developing an allergic<br>
15 reaction in response to an allergen. An allergy refers to acquired hypersensitivity to a<br>
substance (allergen). Allergic conditions include but are not limited to eczema, allergic<br>
rhinitis or coryza, hay fever, conjunctivitis, bronchial asthma, urticaria (hives) and food<br>
allergies, and other atopic conditions.<br>
Currently, allergic diseases are generally treated by the injection of small doses of<br>
20 antigen followed by subsequent increasing dosage of antigen. It is believed that this<br>
procedure induces tolerization to the allergen to prevent further allergic reactions. These<br>
methods, however, can take several years to be effective and are associated with the risk of<br>
side effects such as anaphylactic shock. The methods of the invention avoid these problems.<br>
Allergies are generally caused by IgE antibody generation against harmless allergens.<br>
25 The cytokines that are induced by systemic or mucosal administration of immunostimulatory<br>
nucleic acids are predominantly of a class called Thl (examples are IL-12 and IFN-y) and<br>
these induce both humoral and cellular immune responses. The types of antibodies associated<br>
with a Thl response are generally more protective because they have high neutralization and<br>
opsonization capabilities. The other major type of immune response, which is associated with<br>
30 the production of IL-4, IL-5 and IL-10 cytokines, is termed a Th2 immune response. Th2<br>
responses involve predominately antibodies and these have less protective effect against<br>
infection and some Th2 isotypes (e.g., IgE) are associated with allergy. In general, it appeal's<br>
that allergic diseases are mediated by Th2 type immune responses while Thl responses<br>
provide the best protection against infection, although excessive Thl responses are associated<br>
with autoimmune disease. Based on the ability of the immunostimulatory nucleic acids to<br>
shift the immune response in a subject from a Th2 (which is associated with production of IgE<br>
5 antibodies and allergy) to a Thl response (which is protective against allergic reactions), an<br>
effective dose for inducing an immune response of a immunostimulatory nucleic acid can be<br>
administered to a subject to treat or prevent an allergy.<br>
Thus, the immunostimulatory nucleic acids have significant therapeutic utility in the<br>
treatment of allergic and non-allergic conditions such as asthma. Th2 cytoldnes, especially<br>
10 IL-4 and IL-5 are elevated in the airways of asthmatic subjects. These cytokines promote<br>
important aspects of the asthmatic inflammatory response, including IgE isotope switching,<br>
eosinophil chemotaxis and activation and mast cell growth. Thl cytokines, especially IFN-y<br>
and IL-12, can suppress the formation of Th2 clones and production of Th2 cytokines.<br>
Asthma refers to a disorder of the respiratory system characterized by inflammation,<br>
15 narrowing of the airways and increased reactivity of the airways to inhaled agents. Asthma is<br>
frequently, although not exclusively associated with atopic or allergic symptoms.<br>
A subject having a cancer is a subject that has detectable cancerous cells. The cancer<br>
may be a malignant or non-malignant cancer. Cancers or tumors include but are not limited to<br>
biliary tract cancer; brain cancer; breast cancer; cervical cancer; choriocarcinoma; colon<br>
20 cancer; endometrial cancer; esophageal cancer; gastric cancer; intraepithelial neoplasms;<br>
lymphomas; liver cancer; lung cancer (e.g. small cell and non-small cell); melanoma;<br>
neuroblastomas; oral cancer; ovarian cancer; pancreas cancer; prostate cancer; rectal cancer;<br>
sarcomas; skin cancer; testicular cancer; thyroid cancer; and renal cancer, as well as other<br>
carcinomas and sarcomas. In one embodiment the cancer is hairy cell leukemia, chronic<br>
25 myelogenous leukemia, cutaneous T-cell leukemia, multiple myeloma, follicular lymphoma,<br>
malignant melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, prostate carcinoma,<br>
bladder cell carcinoma, or colon carcinoma.<br>
Some cancer cells are antigenic and thus can be targeted by the immune system. In<br>
one aspect, the combined administration of immunostimulatory nucleic acids and cancer<br>
30 medicaments, particularly those which are classified as cancer immunotherapies, is useful for<br>
stimulating a specific immune response against a cancer antigen.<br>
The theory of immune surveillance is that a prime function of the immune system is to<br>
detect and eliminate neoplastic cells before a tumor forms. A basic principle of this theory is<br>
that cancer cells are antigenically different from normal cells and thus elicit immune reactions<br>
that are similar to those that cause rejection of immunologically incompatible allografts.<br>
5 Studies have confirmed that tumor cells differ, either qualitatively or quantitatively, in their<br>
expression of antigens. Such antigens are referred to interchangeably as tumor antigens or<br>
cancer antigens. Some of these antigens may in turn be tumor-specific antigens or tumor-<br>
associated antigens. "Tumor-specific antigens" are antigens that are specifically present in<br>
tumor cells but not normal cells. Examples of tumor specific antigens are viral antigens in<br>
10 tumors induced by DNA or RNA viruses. "Tumor-associated" antigens are present in both<br>
tumor cells and normal cells but are present in a different quantity or a different form in tumor<br>
cells. Examples of such antigens are oncofetal antigens (e.g., carcinoembryonic antigen),<br>
differentiation antigens (e.g., T and Tn antigens), and oncogene products (e.g., HERAieu).<br>
Different types of cells that can kill tumor targets in vitro and in vivo have been<br>
15 identified: natural killer cells (NK cells), cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTLs), lymphokine-<br>
activated killer cells (LAKs), and activated macrophages. NK cells can kill tumor cells<br>
without having been previously sensitized to specific antigens, and the activity does not<br>
require the presence of class I antigens encoded by the major histocompatibility complex<br>
(MHC) on target cells. NK cells are thought to participate in the control of nascent tumors<br>
20 and in the control of metastatic growth. In contrast to NK cells, CTLs can kill tumor cells<br>
only after they have been sensitized to tumor antigens and when the target antigen is<br>
expressed on the tumor cells that also express MHC class I. CTLs are thought to be effector<br>
cells in the rejection of transplanted tumors and of tumors caused by DNA viruses. LAK cells<br>
are a subset of null lymphocytes distinct from the NK and CTL populations. Activated<br>
25 macrophages can kill tumor cells in a manner that is not antigen dependent nor MHC<br>
restricted once activated. Activated macrophages are through to decrease the growth rate of<br>
the tumors they infiltrate. In vitro assays have identified other immune mechanisms such as<br>
antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxic reactions and lysis by antibody plus<br>
complement. However, these immune effector mechanisms are thought to be less important<br>
30 in vivo than the function of NK, CTLs, LAK, and macrophages in vivo (for review see<br>
Piessens, W.F., and David, J., "Tumor Immunology", In: Scientific American Medicine, Vol.<br>
2, Scientific American Books, N.Y., pp. 1-13,1996.<br>
The goal of immunotherapy is to augment a patient's immune response to an<br>
established tumor. One method of immunotherapy includes the use of adjuvants. Adjuvant<br>
substances derived from microorganisms, such as bacillus Calmette-Guerin, heighten the<br>
immune response and enhance resistance to tumors in animals.<br>
5 An "antigen" as used herein is a molecule capable of provoking an immune response.<br>
Antigens include but are not limited to cells, cell extracts, proteins, polypeptides, peptides,<br>
polysaccharides, polysaccharide conjugates, peptide and non-peptide mimics of<br>
polysaccharides and other molecules, small molecules, lipids, glycolipids, carbohydrates,<br>
viruses and viral extracts and multicellular organisms such as parasites and allergens. The<br>
10 term antigen broadly includes any type of molecule which is recognized by a host immune<br>
system as being foreign. Antigens include but are not limited to cancer antigens, microbial<br>
antigens, and allergens.<br>
A "microbial antigen" as used herein is an antigen of a microorganism and includes<br>
but is not limited to virus, bacteria, parasites, and fungi. Such antigens include the intact<br>
15 microorganism as well as natural isolates and fragments or derivatives thereof and also<br>
synthetic compounds which are identical to or similar to natural microorganism antigens and<br>
induce an immune response specific for that microorganism. A compound is similar to a<br>
natural microorganism antigen if it induces an immune response (humoral and/or cellular) to a<br>
natural microorganism antigen. Such antigens are used routinely in the art and are well<br>
20 known to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
A "cancer antigen" as used herein is a compound, such as a peptide or protein, present<br>
in a tumor or cancer cell and which is capable of provoking an immune response when<br>
expressed on the surface of an antigen presenting cell in the context of an MHC molecule.<br>
Cancer antigens can be prepared from cancer cells either by preparing crude extracts of cancer<br>
25 cells, for example, as described in Cohen, et al., 1994, Cancer Research, 54:1055, by partially<br>
purifying the antigens, by recombinant technology, or by de novo synthesis of known<br>
antigens. Cancer antigens include but are not limited to antigens that are recombinantly<br>
expressed, an immunogenic portion of, or a whole tumor or cancer. Such antigens can be<br>
isolated or prepared recombinantly or by any other means known in the art.<br>
30 Cancer or tumor antigens are differentially expressed by cancer cells and can thereby<br>
be exploited in order to target cancer cells. Some of these antigens are encoded, although not<br>
necessarily expressed, by normal cells. These antigens can be characterized as those which<br>
are normally silent (i.e., not expressed) in normal cells, those that are expressed only at certain<br>
stages of differentiation and those that are temporally expressed such as embryonic and fetal<br>
antigens. Other cancer antigens are encoded by mutant cellular genes, such as oncogenes<br>
(e.g., activated ras oncogene), suppressor genes (e.g., mutant p53), fusion proteins resulting<br>
5 from internal deletions or chromosomal translocations. Still other cancer antigens can be<br>
encoded by viral genes such as those carried on RNA and DNA tumor viruses.<br>
In some aspects of the invention, the subject is "exposed to" the antigen. As used<br>
herein, the term "exposed to" refers to either the active step of contacting the subject with an<br>
antigen or the passive exposure of the subject to the antigen in vivo. Methods for the active<br>
10 exposure of a subject to an antigen are well-known in the art. In general, an antigen is<br>
administered directly to the subject by any means such as intravenous, intramuscular, oral,<br>
transdermal, mucosal, intranasal, intratracheal, or subcutaneous administration. The antigen<br>
can be administered systemically or locally. Methods for administering the antigen and the<br>
immunostimulatory nucleic acid are described in more detail below. A subject is passively<br>
/ J exposed to an antigen if an antigen becomes available for exposure to the immune cells in the<br>
body. A subject may be passively exposed to an antigen, for instance, by entry of a foreign<br>
pathogen into the body or by the development of a tumor cell expressing a foreign antigen on<br>
its surface.<br>
The methods in which a subject is passively exposed to an antigen can be particularly<br>
20 dependent on timing of administration of the immunostimulatory nucleic acid. For instance,<br>
in a subject at risk of developing a cancer or an infectious disease or an allergic or asthmatic<br>
response, the subject may be administered the immunostimulatory nucleic acid on a regular<br>
basis when that risk is greatest, i.e., during allergy season or after exposure to a cancer<br>
causing agent. Additionally the immunostimulatory nucleic acid may be administered to<br>
25 travelers before they travel to foreign lands where they are at risk of exposure to infectious<br>
agents. Likewise the immunostimulatory nucleic acid may be administered to soldiers or<br>
civilians at risk of exposure to biowarfare to induce a systemic or mucosal immune response<br>
to the antigen when and if the subject is exposed to it.<br>
The nucleic acids and other therapeutic agents may be administered systemically,<br>
30 although in some preferred embodiments, the administration is local. Local administration<br>
may include topical application to mucosal surfaces such as those of the mouth, vagina, anus<br>
and penis. In embodiments, in which the administration is local, particularly to the mucosal<br>
surfaces of the vagina, anus and mouth, it is preferred that the nucleic acid is one other than a<br>
CpG nucleic acid.<br>
In particular embodiments, the invention is intended to prevent or treat human<br>
sexually transmitted diseases (STD)s caused by HIV-1, HIV-2, HIV-3, HTLV-I, -II, -HI,<br>
J hepatitis A virus, hepatitis B virus, herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 and 2, papilloma virus,<br>
Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Treponemapattidum, Campylobacter sp., cytomegalovirus (CMV),<br>
Chlamydia trachomatis and Candida albicans using local mucosal administration of<br>
unmethylated CpG nucleic acids.<br>
As used herein, an STD is an infection which is transmitted primarily, but not<br>
10 exclusively, through sexual intercourse. In addition to being transmitted via sexual contact<br>
with an infected subject, some STDs can also be transmitted through contact with bodily<br>
fluids of an infected subject. As used herein, "a bodily fluid" includes blood, saliva, semen,<br>
vaginal fluids, urine, feces and tears. STDs are most commonly transmitted through blood,<br>
saliva, semen and vaginal fluids. As an example, blood and blood product transfusions are<br>
15 common modes of transmission for many sexually transmitted pathogens, including HIV and<br>
Hepatitis viruses.<br>
Sexually transmitted pathogens are generally bacterial, viral, parasitic or fungal in<br>
nature. Organisms that cause STDs include bacteria such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae,<br>
Chlamydia trachomatis, Treponema pallidum, Haemophilus ducreyi, Condyloma acuminata,<br>
20 Calymmatobacterium granulomatis and Ureaplasma urealyticum, viruses such as Human<br>
immunodeficiency viruses (HTV-1 and HTV-2), Human T lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-<br>
I), Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), Human papilloma virus (multiple types), Hepatitis B<br>
virus, Cytomegalovirus and Molluscum contagiosum virus, parasites such as Trichomonas<br>
vaginalis and Phthirus pubis, and fungi such as Candida albicans.<br>
25 Other infections are known to be sexually transmitted, even if sexual transmission is<br>
not their predominant mode of transmission. This latter category includes infections caused<br>
by bacteria such as Mycoplasma hominis, Gardnerella vaginalis and Group B streptococcus,<br>
viruses such as Human T lymphotrophic virus type II (HTLV-II), Hepatitis C and D viruses,<br>
Herpes simplex virus type I (HSV-1) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and parasites such as<br>
30 Sarcoptes scabiei.<br>
The invention also intends to embrace STDs which are transmitted by sexual contact<br>
involving oral-fecal exposure. These STDs are caused by bacteria such as Shigella spp. and<br>
Campylobacter spp., viruses such as Hepatitis A virus and parasites such as Giardia lamblia<br>
and Entamoeba histolytica.<br>
A "subject in need thereof may be a subject who is at risk of developing an STD or<br>
one who has an STD (i.e., a subject having an STD).<br>
5 The nucleic acids are useful in some aspects as a prophylactic for the prevention of an<br>
STD in a subject at risk of developing an STD. A "subject at risk of developing an STD", as<br>
used herein, is a subject who has any risk of developing an STD either by contact with an<br>
infected subject or by contact with a bodily fluid from an infected subject. For instance, a<br>
subject at risk is one who has or who will have a sexual partner who is infected with an STD-<br>
10 causing pathogen. Subjects at risk also include those who engage in unprotected sexual<br>
activity such as having sex, either oral, anal or vaginal, without a condom (i.e., male or female<br>
condom), regardless of whether they or their partners are aware of the existing infection.<br>
Subjects who have multiple sexual partners (e.g., prostitutes or those who frequent prostitutes)<br>
or who have even one sexual partner who in turn has multiple sexual partners are also<br>
15 considered to be at risk. Other subjects at risk of developing an STD are subjects who engage<br>
in other forms of high risk transmission behavior such as sharing of hypodermic needles.<br>
Subjects receiving blood products may also be considered to be at risk, particularly if the<br>
surveillance of the blood supply system is lax. An example of this latter category of subject is<br>
a subject in sub-Saharan African countries which have a blood supply system which is<br>
20 partially or completely contaminated with STD-causing pathogens (e.g., HIV). A subject at<br>
risk may also be one who is planning to travel to an area in which one or more STD-causing<br>
pathogens are common, particularly if it is known that such pathogens are present in the blood<br>
supply system of the area. Another subject at risk is one who has an occupation which<br>
involves potential contact with a bodily fluid of another. Examples of this latter category<br>
25 include, but are not limited to, nurses, doctors, dentists, and rescue personnel such as<br>
ambulance attendants, paramedics, fire-fighters, and police officers. Subjects at risk also<br>
include fetuses and newborns born to mothers who are infected with an STD-causing<br>
pathogen.<br>
All of the afore-mentioned activities that are associated with the transmission of an<br>
30 STD causing pathogen are also referred to herein as "high risk activities". The nucleic acid<br>
and potentially other prophylactic or therapeutic agents to be used in conjunction may be<br>
administered before, or during, or following the time which the subject is engaged in the high<br>
risk activity. A subject who is administered a nucleic acid before engaging in sexual activity,<br>
for example, may receive the nucleic acid at least one month, at least one week, at least 48<br>
hours, at least 24 hours, at least 12 hours, at least 6 hours, at least 4 hours, at least 2 hours (or<br>
any time therebetween as if such time was explicitly recited herein) prior to having sex.<br>
5 Preferably, the time of administration prior to engagement in the high risk activity is a time<br>
sufficient to activate the immune system so that it is active while the infectious agent is<br>
present in the body of the subject. A subject who is administered the nucleic acid following<br>
engagement in the high risk activity may receive it within 2 hours, within 4 hours, within 6<br>
hours, within 12 hours, within 24 hours, within 48 hours, or within 3,4, 5, 6, 7,14,28 days or<br>
10 longer (or any time therebetween as if such time was explicitly recited herein) after engaging<br>
in the high risk activity.<br>
A subject preferably is a non-rodent subject. A non-rodent subject shall mean a<br>
human or vertebrate animal including but not limited to a dog, cat, horse, cow, pig, sheep,<br>
goat, chicken, primate, e.g., monkey, and fish (aquaculture species), e.g. salmon, but<br>
15 specifically excluding rodents such as rats and mice.<br>

The immunostimulatory nucleic acids can also be used to induce an immune response,<br>
such as an antigen specific immune response, birds such as hens, chickens, turkeys, ducks,<br>
geese, quail, and pheasant. Birds are prime targets for many types of infections.<br>
15 Hatching birds are exposed to pathogenic microorganisms shortly after birth.<br>
Although these birds are initially protected against pathogens by maternal derived antibodies,<br>
this protection is only temporary, and the bird's own immature immune system must begin to<br>
protect the bird against the pathogens. It is often desirable to prevent infection in young birds<br>
when they are most susceptible. It is also desirable to prevent against infection in older birds,<br>
20 especially when the birds are housed in closed quarters, leading to the rapid spread of disease.<br>
Thus, it is desirable to administer the Immunostimulatory nucleic acid and the non-nucleic<br>
acid adjuvant of the invention to birds to enhance an antigen-specific immune response when<br>
antigen is present<br>
An example of a common infection in chickens is chicken infectious anemia virus<br>
25 (CIAV). CIAV was first isolated in Japan in 1979 during an investigation of a Marek's<br>
disease vaccination break (Yuasa et al., 1979, Avian Dis. 23:366-385). Since that time, CIAV<br>
has been detected in commercial poultry in all major poultry producing countries (van Bulow<br>
et al., 1991, pp.690-699) in Diseases of Poultry, 9th edition, Iowa State University Press).<br>
CIAV infection results in a clinical disease, characterized by anemia, hemorrhage and<br>
30 immunosuppression, in young susceptible chickens. Atrophy of the thymus and of the bone<br>
marrow and consistent lesions of CIAV-infected chickens are also characteristic of CIAV<br>
infection. Lymphocyte depletion in the thymus, and occasionally in the bursa of Fabricius,<br>
results in immunosuppression and increased susceptibility to secondary viral, bacterial, or<br>
fungal infections which, then complicate the course of the disease. The immunosuppression<br>
may cause aggravated disease after infection with one or more of Marek's disease virus<br>
(MDV), infectious bursal disease virus, reticuloendotheliosis virus, adenovirus, or reovirus. It<br>
5 has been reported that pathogenesis of MDV is enhanced by CIAV (DeBoer et al., 1989, p. 28<br>
In Proceedings of the 38th Western Poultry Diseases Conference, Tempe, Ariz.). Further, it<br>
has been reported that CIAV aggravates the signs of infectious bursal disease (Rosenberger et<br>
al., 1989, Avian Dis. 33:707-713). Chickens develop an age resistance to experimentally<br>
induced disease due to CAA. This is essentially complete by the age of 2 weeks, but older<br>
10 birds are still susceptible to infection (Yuasa, N. et al., 1979 supra; Yuasa, N. et al., Arian<br>
Diseases 24,202-209,1980). However, if chickens are dually infected with CAA and an<br>
immunosuppressive agent (IBDV, MDV etc.), age resistance against the disease is delayed<br>
(Yuasa, N. et al., 1979 and 1980 supra; Bulow von V. et al., J. Veterinary Medicine 33,<br>
93-116,1986). Characteristics of CIAV that may potentiate disease transmission include high<br>
15 resistance to environmental inactivation and some common disinfectants. The economic<br>
impact of CIAV infection on the poultry industry is clear from the fact that 10% to 30% of<br>
infected birds in disease outbreaks die.<br>
Vaccination of birds, like other vertebrate animals can be performed at any age.<br>
Normally, vaccinations are performed at up to 12 weeks of age for a live microorganism and<br>
20 between 14-18 weeks for an inactivated microorganism or other type of vaccine. For in ovo<br>
vaccination, vaccination can be performed in the last quarter of embryo development. The<br>
vaccine may be administered subcutaneously, by spray, orally, intraocularly, intratracheally,<br>
nasally, or by other mucosal delivery methods described herein. Thus, the<br>
immunostimulatory nucleic acids of the invention can be administered to birds and other non-<br>
25 human vertebrates using routine vaccination schedules and the antigen can be administered<br>
after an appropriate time period as described herein.<br>
Cattle and livestock are also susceptible to infection. Diseases which affect these<br>
animals can produce severe economic losses, especially amongst cattle. The methods of the<br>
invention can be used to protect against infection in livestock, such as cows, horses, pigs,<br>
30 sheep, and goats.<br>
Cows can be infected by bovine viruses. Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is a<br>
small enveloped positive-stranded RNA virus and is classified, along with hog cholera virus<br>
(HOCV) and sheep border disease virus (BDV), in the pestivirus genus. Although,<br>
Pestiviruses were previously classified in the Togaviridae family, some studies have<br>
suggested their reclassification within the Flaviviridae family along with the flavivirus and<br>
hepatitis C virus (HCV) groups (Francki, et al., 1991).<br>
5 BVDV, which is an important pathogen of cattle can be distinguished, based on cell<br>
culture analysis, into cytopathogenic (CP) and noncytopathogenic (NCP) biotypes. The NCP<br>
biotype is more widespread although both biotypes can be found in cattle. If a pregnant cow<br>
becomes infected with an NCP strain, the cow can give birth to a persistently infected and<br>
specifically imrnunotolerant calf that will spread virus during its lifetime. The persistently<br>
10 infected cattle can succumb to mucosal disease and both biotypes can then be isolated from<br>
the animal. Clinical manifestations can include abortion, teratogenesis, and respiratory<br>
problems, mucosal disease and mild diarrhea. In addition, severe thrombocytopenia,<br>
associated with herd epidemics, that may result in the death of the animal has been described<br>
and strains associated with this disease seem more virulent than the classical BVDVs.<br>
15 Equine herpes viruses (EHV) comprise a group of antigenically distinct biological<br>
agents which cause a variety of infections in horses ranging from subclinical to fatal disease.<br>
These include Equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1), a ubiquitous pathogen in horses. EHV-1 is<br>
associated with epidemics of abortion, respiratory tract disease, and central nervous system<br>
disorders. Primary infection of upper respiratory tract of young horses results in a febrile<br>
20 illness which lasts for 8 to 10 days. Immunologically experienced mares may be re-infected<br>
via the respiratory tract without disease becoming apparent, so that abortion usually occurs<br>
without warning. The neurological syndrome is associated with respiratory disease or abortion<br>
and can affect animals of either sex at any age, leading to lack of co-ordination, weakness and<br>
posterior paralysis (Telford, E. A. R. et al., Virology 189, 304-316,1992). Other EHV's<br>
25 include EHV-2, or equine cytomegalovirus, EHV-3, equine coital exanthema virus, and<br>
EHV-4, previously classified as EHV-1 subtype 2.<br>
Sheep and goats can be infected by a variety of dangerous microorganisms including<br>
visna-maedi.<br>
Primates such as monkeys, apes and macaques can be infected by simian<br>
30 immunodeficiency virus. Inactivated cell-virus and cell-free whole simian immunodeficiency<br>
vaccines have been reported to afford protection in macaques (Stott et al. (1990) Lancet<br>
36:1538-1541; Desrosiers et al. PNAS USA (1989) 86:6353-6357; Murphey-Corb et al.<br>
(1989) Science 246:1293-1297; and Carlson et al. (1990) AIDS Res. Human Retroviruses<br>
6:1239-1246). A recombinant HIV gpl20 vaccine has been reported to afford protection in<br>
chimpanzees (Berman et al. (1990) Nature 345:622-625).<br>
Cats, both domestic and wild, are susceptible to infection with a variety of<br>
5 microorganisms. For instance, feline infectious peritonitis is a disease which occurs in both<br>
domestic and wild cats, such as lions, leopards, cheetahs, and jaguars. When it is desirable to<br>
prevent infection with this and other types of pathogenic organisms in cats, the methods of the<br>
invention can be used to vaccinate cats to protect them against infection.<br>
Domestic cats may become infected with several retroviruses, including but not<br>
10 limited to feline leukemia virus (FeLV), feline sarcoma virus (FeSV), endogenous type<br>
Concornavirus (RD-114), and feline syncytia-forming virus (FeSFV). Of these, FeLV is the<br>
most significant patliogen, causing diverse symptoms, including lymphoreticular and myeloid<br>
neoplasms, anemias, immune mediated disorders, and an immunodeficiency syndrome which<br>
is similar to human acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Recently, a particular<br>
15 replication-defective FeLV mutant, designated FeLV-AIDS, has been more particularly<br>
associated with immunosuppressive properties.<br>
The discovery of feline T-lymphotropic lentivirus (also referred to as feline<br>
immunodeficiency) was first reported in Pedersen et al. (1987) Science 235:790-793.<br>
Characteristics of FIV have been reported in Yamamoto et al. (1988) Leukemia, December<br>
20 Supplement 2:204S-215S; Yamamoto et al. (1988) Am. J. Vet. Res. 49:1246-1258; and<br>
Ackley et al. (1990) J. Virol. 64:5652-5655. Cloning and sequence analysis of FIV have been<br>
reported in Olmsted et al. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:2448-2452 and<br>
86:4355-4360.<br>
Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a sporadic disease occurring unpredictably in<br>
25 domestic and wild Felidae. While FIP is primarily a disease of domestic cats, it has been<br>
diagnosed in lions, mountain lions, leopards, cheetahs, and the jaguar. Smaller wild cats that<br>
have been afflicted with FIP include the lynx and caracal, sand cat, and pallas cat. In<br>
domestic cats, the disease occurs predominantly in young animals, although cats of all ages<br>
are susceptible. A peak incidence occurs between 6 and 12 months of age. A decline in<br>
30 incidence is noted from 5 to 13 years of age, followed by an increased incidence in cats 14 to<br>
15 years old.<br>
Viral, bacterial, and parasitic diseases in fin-fish, shellfish or other aquatic life forms<br>
pose a serious problem for the aquaculture industry. Owing to the high density of animals in<br>
the hatchery tanks or enclosed marine farming areas, infectious diseases may eradicate a large<br>
proportion of the stock in, for example, a fin-fish, shellfish, or other aquatic life forms facility.<br>
5 Prevention of disease is a more desired remedy to these threats to fish than intervention once<br>
the disease is in progress. Vaccination offish is the only preventative method which may<br>
offer long-term protection through immunity. Nucleic acid based vaccinations are described<br>
in US Patent No. 5,780,448 issued to Davis.<br>
The fish immune system has many features similar to the mammalian immune system,<br>
10 such as the presence of B cells, T cells, lymphokines, complement, and immunoglobulins.<br>

Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in companion animals (i.e., cats and<br>
dogs). Cancer usually strikes older animals which, in the case of house pets, have become<br>
integrated into the family. Forty-five % of dogs older than 10 years of age, are likely to<br>
20 succumb to the disease. The most common treatment options include surgery, chemotherapy<br>
and radiation therapy. Others treatment modalities which have been used with some success<br>
are laser therapy, cryotherapy, hyperthermia and immunotherapy. The choice of treatment<br>
depends on type of cancer and degree of dissemination. Unless the malignant growth is<br>
confined to a discrete area in the body, it is difficult to remove only malignant tissue without<br>
25 also affecting normal cells.<br>
Malignant disorders commonly diagnosed in dogs and cats include but are not limited<br>

20 An allergen refers to a substance (antigen) that can induce an allergic or asthmatic<br>
response in a susceptible subject. The list of allergens is enormous and can include pollens,<br>
insect venoms, animal dander dust, fungal spores and drugs (e.g. penicillin). Examples of<br>
natural, animal and plant allergens include but are not limited to proteins specific to the<br>
following genuses: Canine (Canisfamiliaris); Dermatophagoides (e.g. Dermatophagoides<br>
25 farinae); Felis (Felis domesticus); Ambrosia (Ambrosia artemiisfolia; Lolium (e.g. Lolium<br>
perenne or Lolium multijlorum); Cryptomeria (Cryptomeriajaponicd); Alternaria (Alternaria<br>
alternatd); Alder; Alnus (Alnus gultinoasa); Betula (Betula vermcosa); Quercus (Quercus<br>
alba); Olea (Olea europa); Artemisia (Artemisia vulgaris); Plantago (e.g. Plantago<br>
lanceolata); Parietaria (e.g. Parietaria offlcinalis or Parietariajudaicd); Blattella (e.g.<br>
30 Blattella germanica); Apis (e.g. Apis multiflorum); Cupressus (e.g. Cupressus sempervirens,<br>
Cupressus arizonica and Cupressus macrocarpa); Junipems (e.g. Juniperus sabinoides,<br>
Juniperus virginiana, Juniperus communis and Juniperus ashei); Thuya (e.g. Thuya<br>
orientalis); Chamaecyparis (e.g. Chamaecyparis obtusa); Periplaneta (e.g. Periplaneta<br>
americana); Agropyron (e.g. Agropyron repens); Secale (e.g. Secale cereale); Triticum (e.g.<br>
Triticum aestivum); Dactylis (e.g. Dactylis glomerata); Festuca (e.g. Festuca elatior); Poa<br>
(e.g. Poapratensis or Poa compressa); Avena (e.g. Avena sativa); Holcus (e.g. Holcus<br>
5 lanatus); Anthoxanthum (e.g. Anthoxanthum odoratum); Arrhenatherum (e.g. Arrhenatherum<br>
elatius); Agrostis (e.g. Agrostis alba); Phleum (e.g. Phleum pratense); Phalaris (e.g. Phalaris<br>
arundinacea); Paspalum (e.g. Paspalum notatum); Sorghum (e.g. Sorghum halepensis); and<br>
Bromus (e.g. Bromus inermis).<br>
The antigen may be an antigen that is encoded by a nucleic acid vector or it may be<br>
10 not encoded in a nucleic acid vector. In the former case the nucleic acid vector is<br>
administered to the subject and the antigen is expressed in vivo. In the latter case the antigen<br>
may be administered directly to the subject. An antigen not encoded in a nucleic acid vector<br>
as used herein refers to any type of antigen that is not a nucleic acid. For instance, in some<br>
aspects of the invention the antigen not encoded in a nucleic acid vector is a polypeptide.<br>
75 Minor modifications of the primary amino acid sequences of polypeptide antigens may also<br>
result in a polypeptide which has substantially equivalent antigenic activity as compared to<br>
the unmodified counterpart polypeptide. Such modifications may be deliberate, as by<br>
site-directed mutagenesis, or may be spontaneous. All of the polypeptides produced by these<br>
modifications are included herein as long as antigenicity still exists. The polypeptide may be,<br>
20 for example, a viral polypeptide.<br>
The term "substantially purified" as used herein refers to a polypeptide which is<br>
substantially free of other proteins, lipids, carbohydrates or other materials with which it is<br>
naturally associated. One skilled in the art can purify viral or bacterial polypeptides using<br>
standard techniques for protein purification. The substantially pure polypeptide will often<br>
25 yield a single major band on a non-reducing polyacrylamide gel. In the case of partially<br>
glycosylated polypeptides or those that have several start codons, there may be several bands<br>
on a non-reducing polyacrylamide gel, but these will form a distinctive pattern for that<br>
polypeptide. The purity of the viral or bacterial polypeptide can also be determined by<br>
ammo-terminal amino acid sequence analysis. Other types of antigens not encoded by a<br>
30 nucleic acid vector such as polysaccharides, small molecule, mimics etc are described above,<br>
and included within the invention.<br>
The invention also utilizes polynucleotides encoding the antigenic polypeptides. It is<br>
envisioned that the antigen may be delivered to the subject in a nucleic acid molecule which<br>
encodes for the antigen such that the antigen must be expressed in vivo. Such antigens<br>
delivered to the subject in a nucleic acid vector are referred to as antigens encoded by a<br>
5 nucleic acid vector. The nucleic acid encoding the antigen is operatively linked to a gene<br>
expression sequence which directs the expression of the antigen nucleic acid within a<br>
eukaryotic cell. The gene expression sequence is any regulatory nucleotide sequence, such as<br>
a promoter sequence or promoter-enhancer combination, which facilitates the efficient<br>
transcription and translation of the antigen nucleic acid to which it is operatively linked. The<br>
10 gene expression sequence may, for example, be a mammalian or viral promoter, such as a<br>
constitutive or inducible promoter. Constitutive mammalian promoters include, but are not<br>
limited to, the promoters for the following genes: hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase<br>
(KPTR), adenosine deaminase, pyruvate kinase, b-actin promoter and other constitutive<br>
promoters. Exemplary viral promoters which function constitutively in eukaryotic cells<br>
15 include, for example, promoters from the cytomegalovirus (CMV), simian virus (e.g., SV40),<br>
papilloma virus, adenovirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Rous sarcoma virus,<br>
cytomegalovirus, the long terminal repeats (LTR) of Moloney leukemia virus and other<br>
retro viruses, and the thymidine kinase promoter of herpes simplex virus. Other constitutive<br>
promoters are known to those of ordinary skill in the art. The promoters useful as gene<br>
20 expression sequences of the invention also include inducible promoters. Inducible promoters<br>
are expressed in the presence of an inducing agent. For example, the metallothionein<br>
promoter is induced to promote transcription and translation in the presence of certain metal<br>
ions. Other inducible promoters are known to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
In general, the gene expression sequence shall include, as necessary, 5'<br>
25 non-transcribing and 5' non-translating sequences involved with the initiation of transcription<br>
and translation, respectively, such as a TATA box, capping sequence, CAAT sequence, and<br>
the like. Especially, such 5' non-transcribing sequences will include a promoter region which<br>
includes a promoter sequence for transcriptional control of the operably joined antigen nucleic<br>
acid. The gene expression sequences optionally include enhancer sequences or upstream<br>
30 activator sequences as desired.<br>
The antigen nucleic acid is operatively linked to the gene expression sequence. As<br>
used herein, the antigen nucleic acid sequence and the gene expression sequence are said to be<br>
operably linked when they are covalently linked in such a way as to place the expression or<br>
transcription and/or translation of the antigen coding sequence under the influence or control<br>
of the gene expression sequence. Two DNA sequences are said to be operably linked if<br>
induction of a promoter in the 5' gene expression sequence results in the transcription of the<br>
5 antigen sequence and if the nature of the linkage between the two DNA sequences does not<br>
(1) result in the introduction of a frame-shift mutation, (2) interfere with the ability of the<br>
promoter region to direct the transcription of the antigen sequence, or (3) interfere with the<br>
ability of the corresponding RNA transcript to be translated into a protein. Thus, a gene<br>
expression sequence would be operably linked to an antigen nucleic acid sequence if the gene<br>
10 expression sequence were capable of effecting transcription of that antigen nucleic acid<br>
sequence such that the resulting transcript is translated into the desired protein or polypeptide.<br>
The antigen nucleic acid of the invention may be delivered to the immune system<br>
alone or in association with a vector. In its broadest sense, a vector is any vehicle capable of<br>
facilitating the transfer of the antigen nucleic acid to the cells of the immune system so that<br>
15 the antigen can be expressed and presented on the surface of the immune cell. The vector<br>
generally transports the nucleic acid to the immune cells with reduced degradation relative to<br>
the extent of degradation that would result in the absence of the vector. The vector optionally<br>
includes the above-described gene expression sequence to enhance expression of the antigen<br>
nucleic acid in immune cells. In general, the vectors useful in the invention include, but are<br>
20 not limited to, plasmids, phagemids, viruses, other vehicles derived from viral or bacterial<br>
sources that have been manipulated by the insertion or incorporation of the antigen nucleic<br>
acid sequences. Viral vectors are a preferred type of vector and include, but are not limited<br>
to, nucleic acid sequences from the following viruses: retrovirus, such as Moloney murine<br>
leukemia virus, Harvey murine sarcoma virus, murine mammary tumor virus, and Rous<br>
25 sarcoma virus; adenovirus, adeno-associated virus; SV40-type viruses; polyoma viruses;<br>
Epstein-Barr viruses; papilloma viruses; herpes virus; vaccinia virus; polio virus; and RNA<br>
virus such as a retrovirus. One can readily employ other vectors not named but known in the<br>
art.<br>
Preferred viral vectors are based on non-cytopathic eukaryotic viruses in which<br>
30 non-essential genes have been replaced with the gene of interest. Non-cytopathic viruses<br>
include retroviruses, the life cycle of which involves reverse transcription of genomic viral<br>
RNA into DNA with subsequent proviral integration into host cellular DNA. Retroviruses<br>
have been approved for human gene therapy trials. Most useful are those retroviruses that are<br>
replication-deficient (i.e., capable of directing synthesis of the desired proteins, but incapable<br>
of manufacturing an infectious particle). Such genetically altered retroviral expression<br>
vectors have general utility for the high-efficiency transduction of genes in vivo. Standard<br>
5 protocols for producing replication-deficient retroviruses (including the steps of incorporation<br>
of exogenous genetic material into a plasmid, transfection of a packaging cell lined with<br>
plasmid, production of recombinant retroviruses by the packaging cell line, collection of viral<br>
particles from tissue culture media, and infection of the target cells with viral particles) are<br>
provided in Rriegler, M., Gene Transfer and Expression, A Laboratory Manual W.H.<br>
10 Freeman CO., New York (1990) and Murry, E.J. Methods in Molecular Biology, vol. 7,<br>
Humana Press, Inc., Cliffton, New Jersey (1991).<br>
A preferred virus for certain applications is the adeno-associated virus, a<br>
double-stranded DNA virus. The adeno-associated virus can be engineered to be replication<br>
-deficient and is capable of infecting a wide range of cell types and species. It further has<br>
15 advantages such as, heat and lipid solvent stability; high transduction frequencies in cells of<br>
diverse lineages, including hemopoietic cells; and lack of superinfection inhibition thus<br>
allowing multiple series of transductions. Reportedly, the adeno-associated virus can<br>
integrate into human cellular DNA in a site-specific manner, thereby minimizing the<br>
possibility of insertional mutagenesis and variability of inserted gene expression characteristic<br>
20 of retroviral infection. In addition, wild-type adeno-associated virus infections have been<br>
followed in tissue culture for greater than 100 passages hi the absence of selective pressure,<br>
implying that the adeno-associated virus genomic integration is a relatively stable event. The<br>
adeno-associated virus can also function in an extrachromosomal fashion.<br>
Other vectors include plasmid vectors. Plasmid vectors have been extensively<br>
25 described in the art and are well-known to those of skill in the art. See e.g., Sambrook et al.,<br>
Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Second Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory<br>
Press, 1989. In the last few years, plasmid vectors have been found to be particularly<br>
advantageous for delivering genes to cells in vivo because of their inability to replicate within<br>
and integrate into a host genome. These plasmids, however, having a promoter compatible<br>
30 with the host cell, can express a peptide from a gene operatively encoded within the plasmid.<br>
Some commonly used plasmids include pBR322, pUC18, pUC19, pRC/CMV, SV40, and<br>
pBlueScript. Other plasmids are well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
Additionally, plasmids may be custom designed using restriction enzymes and ligation<br>
reactions to remove and add specific fragments of DNA.<br>
It has recently been discovered that gene carrying plasmids can be delivered to the<br>
immune system using bacteria. Modified forms of bacteria such as Salmonella can be<br>
J transfected with the plasmid and used as delivery vehicles. The bacterial delivery vehicles<br>
can be administered to a host subject orally or by other administration means. The bacteria<br>
deliver the plasmid to immune cells, e.g. B cells, dendritic cells, likely by passing through the<br>
gut barrier. High levels of immune protection have been established using this methodology.<br>
Such methods of delivery are useful for the aspects of the invention utilizing systemic<br>
10 delivery of antigen, Immunostimulatory nucleic acid and/or other therapeutic agent.<br>
Thus, in addition to being suitable as stand alone agents, the immunostimulatory<br>
nucleic acids are useful, inter alia, as vaccine adjuvants. It was previously established that<br>
CpG oligonucleotides are excellent vaccine adjuvants. In order to identify the best<br>
immunostimulatory nucleic acids for use as a vaccine adjuvant in humans and other non-<br>
75 rodent animals, in vivo screening of different nucleic acids for this purpose was conducted.<br>
Several in vitro assays were evaluated in mice for their predictive value of adjuvant activity in<br>
vivo. During the course of this study, an in vitro test that is predictive of in vivo efficacy was<br>
identified. It was discovered, rather surprisingly, that both B cell and NK cell activation<br>
correlated particularly well with the ability of an immunostimulatory nucleic acid to enhance<br>
20 an in vivo immune response against an antigen.<br>
The nucleic acids are also useful for improving survival, differentiation, activation and<br>
maturation of dendritic cells. The immunostimulatory nucleic acids have the unique<br>
capability to promote cell survival, differentiation, activation and maturation of dendritic<br>
cells. Dendritic precursor cells isolated from blood by immunomagnetic cell sorting develop<br>
25 morphologic and functional characteristics of dendritic cells during a two day incubation with<br>
GM-CSF. Without GM-CSF these cells undergo apoptosis. The immunostimulatory nucleic<br>
acids are superior to GM-CSF in promoting survival and differentiation of dendritic cells<br>
(MHCII expression, cell size, granularity). The immunostimulatory nucleic acids also induce<br>
maturation of dendritic cells. Since dendritic cells form the link between the innate and the<br>
30 acquired immune system, by presenting antigens as well as through their expression of pattern<br>
recognition receptors which detect microbial molecules like LPS in their local environment,<br>
the ability to activate dendritic cells with immunostimulatory nucleic acids supports the use of<br>
these immunostimulatory nucleic acid based strategies for in vivo and ex-vivo immunotherapy<br>
against disorders such as cancer and allergic or infectious diseases. The immunostimulatory<br>
nucleic acids are also useful for activating and inducing maturation of dendritic cells.<br>
Immunostimulatory nucleic acids also increase natural killer cell lyric activity and<br>
5 antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). ADCC can be performed using a<br>
immunostimulatory nucleic acid in combination with an antibody specific for a cellular target,<br>
such as a cancer cell. When the immunostimulatory nucleic acid is administered to a subject<br>
in conjunction with the antibody the subject's immune system is induced to kill the tumor<br>
cell. The antibodies useful in the ADCC procedure include antibodies which interact with a<br>
10 cell in the body. Many such antibodies specific for cellular targets have been described in the<br>
art and many are commercially available. Examples of these antibodies are listed below<br>
among the list of cancer immunotherapies.<br>
The nucleic acids are also useful for redirecting an immune response from a Th2<br>
immune response to a Thl immune response. Redirection of an immune response from a Th2<br>
IS to a Thl immune response can be assessed by measuring the levels of cytokines produced in<br>
response to the nucleic acid (e.g., by inducing monocytic cells and other cells to produce Thl<br>
cytokines, including IL-12, IFN-y and GM-CSF). The redirection or rebalance of the immune<br>
response from a Th2 to a Thl response is particularly useful for the treatment or prevention of<br>
asthma. For instance, an effective amount for treating asthma can be that amount; useful for<br>
20 redirecting a Th2 type of immune response that is associated with asthma to a Thl type of<br>
response. Th2 cytokines, especially IL-4 and IL-5 are elevated in the airways of asthmatic<br>
subjects. These cytokines promote important aspects of the asthmatic inflammatory response,<br>
including IgE isotype switching, eosinophil chemotaxis and activation and mast cell growth.<br>
Till cytokines, especially IFN-y and IL-12, can suppress the formation of Th2 clones and<br>
25 production of Th2 cytokines. The immunostimulatory nucleic acids of the invention cause an<br>
increase in Thl cytokines which helps to rebalance the immune system, preventing or<br>
reducing the adverse effects associated with a predominately Th2 immune response.<br>
The invention also includes a method for inducing antigen non-specific innate immune<br>
activation and broad spectrum resistance to infectious challenge using the immunostimulatory<br>
30 nucleic acids. The term antigen non-specific innate immune activation as used herein refers<br>
to the activation of immune cells other than B cells and for instance can include the activation<br>
of NK cells, T cells or other immune cells that can respond in an antigen independent fashion<br>
or some combination of these cells. A broad spectrum resistance to infectious challenge is<br>
induced because the immune cells are in active form and are primed to respond to any<br>
invading compound or microorganism. The cells do not have to be specifically primed<br>
against a particular antigen. This is particularly useful in biowarfare, and the other<br>
5 circumstances described above such as travelers.<br>
The nucleic acids of the invention can be used in combination with other therapeutic<br>
agents including anti-microbial agents, adjuvants, cytokines, anti-cancer therapies, allergy<br>
medicaments, asthma medicaments, and the like.<br>
The nucleic acids of the invention may be administered to a subject with an anti-<br>
10 microbial agent. An anti-microbial agent, as used herein, refers to a naturally-occurring or<br>
synthetic compound which is capable of killing or inhibiting infectious microorganisms. The<br>
type of anti-microbial agent useful according to the invention will depend upon the type of<br>
microorganism with which the subject is infected or at risk of becoming infected. Anti-<br>
microbial agents include but are not limited to anti-bacterial agents, anti-viral agents, anti-<br>
15 fungal agents and anti-parasitic agents. Phrases such as "anti-infective agent", "anti-bacterial<br>
agent", "anti-viral agent", "anti-fungal agent", "anti-parasitic agent" and "parasiticide" have<br>
well-established meanings to those of ordinary skill in the art and are defined in standard<br>
medical texts. Briefly, anti-bacterial agents kill or inhibit bacteria, and include antibiotics as<br>
well as other synthetic or natural compounds having similar functions.<br>
20 Antibiotics are low molecular weight molecules which are produced as secondary<br>
metabolites by cells, such as microorganisms. In general, antibiotics interfere with one or<br>
more bacterial functions or structures which are specific for the microorganism and which are<br>
not present in host cells. Anti-viral agents can be isolated from natural sources or synthesized<br>
and are useful for killing or inhibiting viruses. Anti-fungal agents are used to treat superficial<br>
25 fungal infections as well as opportunistic and primary systemic fungal infections. Anti-<br>
parasite agents kill or inhibit parasites.<br>
Antibacterial agents kill or inhibit the growth or function of bacteria. A large class of<br>
antibacterial agents is antibiotics. Antibiotics, which are effective for killing or inhibiting a<br>
wide range of bacteria, are referred to as broad spectrum antibiotics. Other types of<br>
30 antibiotics are predominantly effective against the bacteria of the class gram-positive or gram-<br>
negative. These types of antibiotics are referred to as narrow spectrum antibiotics.<br>
Other antibiotics which are effective against a single organism or disease and not<br>
against other types of bacteria, are referred to as limited spectrum antibiotics. Antibacterial<br>
agents are sometimes classified based on their primary mode of action. In general,<br>
antibacterial agents are cell wall synthesis inhibitors, cell membrane inhibitors, protein<br>
synthesis inhibitors, nucleic acid synthesis or functional inhibitors, and competitive inhibitors.<br>

Antiviral agents are compounds which prevent infection of cells by viruses or<br>
replication of the virus within the cell. There are many fewer antiviral drugs than<br>
antibacterial drugs because the process of viral replication is so closely related to DNA<br>
replication within the host cell, that non-specific antiviral agents would often be toxic to the<br>
host. There are several stages within the process of viral infection which can be blocked or<br>
inhibited by antiviral agents. These stages include, attachment of the virus to the host cell<br>
5 (immunoglobulin or binding peptides), uncoating of the virus (e.g. amantadine), synthesis or<br>
translation of viral mRNA (e.g. interferon), replication of viral RNA or DNA (e.g. nucleoside<br>
analogues), maturation of new virus proteins (e.g. protease inhibitors), and budding and<br>
release of the virus.<br>
Nucleotide analogues are synthetic compounds which are similar to nucleotides, but<br>
10 which have an incomplete or abnormal deoxyribose or ribose group. Once the nucleotide<br>
analogues are in the cell, they are phosphorylated, producing the triphosphate formed which<br>
competes with normal nucleotides for incorporation into the viral DNA or RNA. Once the<br>
triphosphate form of the nucleotide analogue is incorporated into the growing nucleic acid<br>
chain, it causes irreversible association with the viral polymerase and thus chain termination.<br>
75 Nucleotide analogues include, but are not limited to, acyclovir (used for the treatment of<br>
herpes simplex virus and varicella-zoster virus), gancyclovir (useful for the treatment of<br>
cytomegalovirus), idoxuridine, ribavirin (useful for the treatment of respiratory syncitial<br>
virus), dideoxyinosine, dideoxycytidine, and zidovudine (azidothymidine).<br>
The interferons are cytokines which are secreted by virus-infected cells as well as immune<br>
20 cells. The interferons function by binding to specific receptors on cells adjacent to the<br>
infected cells, causing the change in the cell which protects it from infection by the virus, a<br>
and p-interferon also induce the expression of Class I and Class IIMHC molecules on the<br>
surface of infected cells, resulting in increased antigen presentation for host immune cell<br>
recognition, a and P-interferons are available as recombinant forms and have been used for<br>
25 the treatment of chronic hepatitis B and C infection. At the dosages which are effective for<br>
anti-viral therapy, interferons have severe side effects such as fever, malaise and weight loss.<br>
Immunoglobulin therapy is used for the prevention of viral infection.<br>
Immunoglobulin therapy for viral infections is different than bacterial infections, because<br>
rather than being antigen-specific, the immunoglobulin therapy functions by binding to<br>
30 extracellular virions and preventing them from attaching to and entering cells which are<br>
susceptible to the viral infection. The therapy is useful for the prevention of viral infection for<br>
the period of time that the antibodies are present in the host. In general there are two types of<br>
immunoglobulin therapies, normal immunoglobulin therapy and hyper-imrnunoglobulin<br>
therapy. Nonnal immune globulin therapy utilizes a antibody product which is prepared from<br>
the serum of normal blood donors and pooled. This pooled product contains low titers of<br>
antibody to a wide range of human viruses, such as hepatitis A, parvovirus, enterovirus<br>
5 (especially in neonates). Hyper-immune globulin therapy utilizes antibodies which are<br>
prepared from the serum of individuals who have high titers of an antibody to a particular<br>
virus. Those antibodies are then used against a specific virus. Examples of hyper-immune<br>
globulins include zoster immune globulin (useful for the prevention of varicella in immuno-<br>
compromised children and neonates), human rabies immunoglobulin (useful in the post-<br>
70 exposure prophylaxis of a subject bitten by a rabid animal), hepatitis B immune globulin<br>
(useful in the prevention of hepatitis B virus, especially in a subject exposed to the virus), and<br>
RSV immune globulin (useful in the treatment of respiratory syncitial virus infections).<br>
Another type of immunoglobulin therapy is active immunization. This involves the<br>
administration of antibodies or antibody fragments to viral surface proteins. Two types of<br>
15 vaccines which are available for active immunization of hepatitis B include serum-derived<br>
hepatitis B antibodies and recombinant hepatitis B antibodies. Both are prepared from<br>
HBsAg. The antibodies are administered in three doses to subjects at high risk of infection<br>
with hepatitis B virus, such as health care workers, sexual partners of chronic carriers, and<br>
infants.<br>

Anti-fungal agents are useful for the treatment and prevention of infective fungi.<br>
Anti-fungal agents are sometimes classified by their mechanism of action. Some anti-fungal<br>
agents function as cell wall inhibitors by inhibiting glucose synthase. These include, but are<br>
not limited to, basiungin/ECB. Other anti-fungal agents function by destabilizing membrane<br>
integrity. These include, but are not limited to, immidazoles, such as clotrimazole,<br>

The immunostimulatory nucleic acids may also be administered in conjunction with an<br>
anti-cancer therapy. Anti-cancer therapies include cancer medicaments, radiation and<br>
surgical procedures. As used herein, a "cancer medicament" refers to a agent which is<br>
25 administered to a subject for the purpose of treating a cancer. As used herein, "treating<br>
cancer" includes preventing the development of a cancer, reducing the symptoms of cancer,<br>
and/or inhibiting the growth of an established cancer. In other aspects, the cancer<br>
medicament is administered to a subject at risk of developing a cancer for the purpose of<br>
reducing the risk of developing the cancer. Various types of medicaments for the treatment of<br>
30 cancer are described herein. For the purpose of this specification, cancer medicaments are<br>
classified as chemotherapeutic agents, immunotherapeutic agents, cancer vaccines, hormone<br>
therapy, and biological response modifiers.<br>
As used herein, a "cancer medicament" refers to an agent which is administered to a<br>
subject for the purpose of treating a cancer. As used herein, "treating cancer" includes<br>
preventing the development of a cancer, reducing the symptoms of cancer, and/or inhibiting<br>
the growth of an established cancer. In other aspects, the cancer medicament is administered<br>
5 to a subject at risk of developing a cancer for the purpose of reducing the risk of developing<br>
the cancer. Various types of medicaments for the treatment of cancer are described herein.<br>
For the purpose of this specification, cancer medicaments are classified as chemotherapeutic<br>
agents, immunotherapeutic agents, cancer vaccines, hormone therapy, and biological response<br>
modifiers. Additionally, the methods of the invention are intended to embrace the use of<br>
10 more than one cancer medicament along with the imrnunostimulatory nucleic acids. As an<br>
example, where appropriate, the immunostimulatory nucleic acids may be administered with a<br>
both a chemotherapeutic agent and an immunotherapeutic agent. Alternatively, the cancer<br>
medicament may embrace an immunotherapeutic agent and a cancer vaccine, or a<br>
chemotherapeutic agent and a cancer vaccine, or a chemotherapeutic agent, an<br>
15 immunotherapeutic agent and a cancer vaccine all administered to one subject for the purpose<br>
of treating a subject having a cancer or at risk of developing a cancer.<br>
Cancer medicaments function in a variety of ways. Some cancer medicaments work<br>
by targeting physiological mechanisms that are specific to tumor cells. Examples include the<br>
targeting of specific genes and their gene products (i.e., proteins primarily) which are mutated<br>
20 in cancers. Such genes include but are not limited to oncogenes (e.g., Ras, Her2, bcl-2),<br>
tumor suppressor genes (e.g., EGF, p53, Rb), and cell cycle targets (e.g., CDK4, p21,<br>
telomerase). Cancer medicaments can alternately target signal transduction pathways and<br>
molecular mechanisms which are altered in cancer cells. Targeting of cancer cells via the<br>
epitopes expressed on their cell surface is accomplished through the use of monoclonal<br>
25 antibodies. This latter type of cancer medicament is generally referred to herein as<br>
immunotherapy.<br>
Other cancer medicaments target cells other than cancer cells. For example, some<br>
medicaments prime the immune system to attack tumor cells (i.e., cancer vaccines). Still other<br>
medicaments, called angiogenesis inhibitors, function by attacking the blood supply of solid<br>
30 tumors. Since the most malignant cancers are able to metastasize (i.e., exist the primary<br>
tumor site and seed a distal tissue, thereby forming a secondary tumor), medicaments that<br>
impede this metastasis are also useful in the treatment of cancer. Angiogenic mediators<br>
include basic FGF, VEGF, angiopoietins, angiostatin, endostatin, TNFa, TNP-470,<br>
thrombospondin-1, platelet factor 4, CAI, and certain members of the integrin family of<br>
proteins. One category of this type of medicament is a metalloproteinase inhibitor, which<br>
inhibits the enzymes used by the cancer cells to exist the primary tumor site and extravasate<br>
5 into another tissue.<br>
Immunotherapeutic agents are medicaments which derive from antibodies or antibody<br>
fragments which specifically bind or recognize a cancer antigen. As used herein a cancer<br>
antigen is broadly defined as an antigen expressed by a cancer cell. Preferably, the antigen is<br>
expressed at the cell surface of the cancer cell. Even more preferably, the antigen is one<br>
10 which is not expressed by nonnal cells, or at least not expressed to the same level as in cancer<br>
cells. Antibody-based immunotherapies may function by binding to the cell surface of a<br>
cancer cell and thereby stimulate the endogenous immune system to attack the cancer cell.<br>
Another way in which antibody-based therapy functions is as a delivery system for the<br>
specific targeting of toxic substances to cancer cells. Antibodies are usually conjugated to<br>
15 toxins such as ricin (e.g., from castor beans), calicheamicin and maytansinoids, to radioactive<br>
isotopes such as Iodine-131 and Yttrium-90, to chemotherapeutic agents (as described herein),<br>
or to biological response modifiers. In this way, the toxic substances can be concentrated in<br>
the region of the cancer and non-specific toxicity to normal cells can be minimized. In<br>
addition to the use of antibodies which are specific for cancer antigens, antibodies which bind<br>
20 to vasculature, such as those which bind to endothelial cells, are also useful in the invention.<br>
This is because generally solid tumors are dependent upon newly formed blood vessels to<br>
survive, and thus most tumors are capable of recruiting and stimulating the growth of new<br>
blood vessels. As a result, one strategy of many cancer medicaments is to attack the blood<br>
vessels feeding a tumor and/or the connective tissues (or stroma) supporting such blood<br>
25 vessels.<br>
The use of immunostimulatory nucleic acids in conjunction with immunotherapeutic<br>
agents such as monoclonal antibodies is able to increase long-term survival through a number<br>
of mechanisms including significant enhancement of ADCC (as discussed above), activation<br>
of natural killer (NK) cells and an increase in IFNa levels. The nucleic acids when used in<br>
30 combination with monoclonal antibodies serve to reduce the dose of the antibody required to<br>
achieve a biological result.<br>
Examples of cancer immunotherapies which are currently being used or which are in<br>
development are listed in Table 4.<br><br>

Cancer vaccines are medicaments which are intended to stimulate an endogenous<br>
immune response against cancer cells. Currently produced vaccines predominantly activate<br>
the humoral immune system (i.e., the antibody dependent immune response). Other vaccines<br>
currently in development are focused on activating the cell-mediated immune system<br>
including cytotoxic T lymphocytes which are capable of killing tumor cells. Cancer vaccines<br>
generally enhance the presentation of cancer antigens to both antigen presenting cells (e.g.,<br>
macrophages and dendritic cells) and/or to other immune cells such as T cells, B cells, and<br>
NK cells.<br>
Although cancer vaccines may take one of several forms, as discussed infra, their<br>
purpose is to deliver cancer antigens and/or cancer associated antigens to antigen presenting<br>
cells (APC) in order to facilitate the endogenous processing of such antigens by APC and the<br>
ultimate presentation of antigen presentation on the cell surface in the context of MHC class I<br>
molecules. One form of cancer vaccine is a whole cell vaccine which is a preparation of<br>
cancer cells which have been removed from a subject, treated ex vivo and then reintroduced<br>
as whole cells in the subject. Lysates of tumor cells can also be used as cancer vaccines to<br>
elicit an immune response. Another form cancer vaccine is a peptide vaccine which uses<br>
cancer-specific or cancer-associated small proteins to activate T cells. Cancer-associated<br>
proteins are proteins which are not exclusively expressed by cancer cells (i.e., other normal<br>
cells may still express these antigens). However, the expression of cancer-associated antigens<br>
is generally consistently upregulated with cancers of a particular type. Yet another form of<br>
5 cancer vaccine is a dendritic cell vaccine which includes whole dendritic cells which have<br>
been exposed to a cancer antigen or a cancer-associated antigen in vitro. Lysates or<br>
membrane fractions of dendritic cells may also be used as cancer vaccines. Dendritic cell<br>
vaccines are able to activate antigen-presenting cells directly. Other cancer vaccines include<br>
ganglioside vaccines, heat-shock protein vaccines, viral and bacterial vaccines, and nucleic<br>
10 acid vaccines.<br>
The use of immunostimulatory nucleic acids in conjunction with cancer vaccines<br>
provides an improved antigen-specific humoral and cell mediated immune response, in<br>
addition to activating NK cells and endogenous dendritic cells, and increasing IFNa levels.<br>
This enhancement allows a vaccine with a reduced antigen dose to be used to achieve the<br>
15 same beneficial effect. In some instances, cancer vaccines may be used along with adjuvants,<br>
such as those described above.<br>
Other vaccines take the form of dendritic cells which have been exposed to cancer<br>
antigens in vitro, have processed the antigens and are able to express the cancer antigens at<br>
their cell surface in the context of MHC molecules for effective antigen presentation to other<br>
20 immune system cells.<br>
The immunostimulatory nucleic acids are used in one aspect of the invention in<br>
conjunction with cancer vaccines which are dendritic cell based. A dendritic cell is a<br>
professional antigen presenting cell. Dendritic cells form the link between the innate and the<br>
acquired immune system by presenting antigens and through their expression of pattern<br>
25 recognition receptors which detect microbial molecules like LPS in their local environment.<br>
Dendritic cells efficiently internalize, process, and present soluble specific antigen to which it<br>
is exposed. The process of internalizing and presenting antigen causes rapid upregulation of<br>
the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and costimulatory molecules, the<br>
production of cytokines, and migration toward lymphatic organs where they are believed to be<br>
30 involved in the activation of T cells.<br>
Table 5 lists a variety of cancer vaccines which are either currently being used or are<br>
in development.<br>
As used herein, chemotherapeutic agents embrace all other fonns of cancer<br>
medicaments which do not fall into the categories of immunotherapeutic agents or cancer<br>
vaccines. Chemotherapeutic agents as used herein encompass both chemical and biological<br>
agents. These agents function to inhibit a cellular activity which the cancer cell is dependent<br>
upon for continued survival. Categories of chemotherapeutic agents include<br>
alkylating/alkaloid agents, antimetabolites, hormones or hormone analogs, and miscellaneous<br>
antineoplastic drugs. Most if not all of these agents are directly toxic to cancer cells and do<br>
not require immune stimulation. Combination chemotherapy and immunostimulatory nucleic<br>
acid administration increases the maximum tolerable dose of chemotherapy.<br>
Chemotherapeutic agents which are currently in development or in use in a clinical<br>
setting are shown in Table 6.<br><br>
In one embodiment, the methods of the invention use irrununostimulatory nucleic<br>
acids as a replacement to the use of IFNa therapy in the treatment of cancer. Currently, some<br>
treatment protocols call for the use of IFNa. Since IFNa is produced following the<br>
administration of some immunostimulatory nucleic acids, these nucleic acids can be used to<br>
generate IFNa endogenously.<br>
In another embodiment, the asthma/allergy medicament is a medicament selected from<br>
the group consisting of PDE-4 inhibitor, bronchodilator/beta-2 agonist, K+ channel opener,<br>
VLA-4 antagonist, neurokm antagonist, TXA2 synthesis inhibitor, xanthanine, arachidonic<br>
acid antagonist, 5 lipoxygenase inhibitor, thromboxin A2 receptor antagonist, thromboxane<br>
A2 antagonist, inhibitor of 5-lipox activation protein, and protease inhibitor, but is not so<br>
limited. In some important embodiments, the asthma/allergy medicament is a<br>
bronchodilator/beta-2 agonist selected from the group consisting of salmeterol, salbutamol,<br>
terbutaline, D2522/formoterol, fenoterol, and orciprenaline.<br>
In another embodiment, the asthma/allergy medicament is a medicament selected from<br>
the group consisting of anti-histamines and prostaglandin inducers. In one embodiment, the<br>
anti-histamine is selected from the group consisting of loratidine, cetirizine, buclizhie,<br>
ceterizine analogues, fexofenadine, terfenadine, desloratadine, norastemizole, epinastine,<br>
5 ebastine, ebastine, astemizole, levocabastine, azelastine, tranilast, terfenadine, mizolastine,<br>
betatastine, CS 560, and HSR 609. In another embodiment, the prostaglandin inducer is S-<br>
5751.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the asthma/allergy medicament is selected from the group<br>
consisting of steroids and immunomodulators. The immunomodulators may be selected from<br>
10 the group consisting of anti-inflammatory agents, leukotriene antagonists, IL-4 muteins,<br>
soluble IL-4 receptors, immunosuppressants, anti-IL-4 antibodies, IL-4 antagonists, anti-IL-5<br>
antibodies, soluble EL-13 receptor-Fc fusion proteins, anti-IL-9 antibodies, CCR3 antagonists,<br>
CCR5 antagonists, VLA-4 inhibitors, and downregulators of IgE, but are not so limited. In<br>
one embodiment, the downregulator of IgE is an anti-IgE.<br>
15 In another embodiment, the steroid is selected from the group consisting of<br>
beclomethasone, fluticasone, tramcinolone, budesonide, and budesonide. In still a further<br>
embodiment, the immunosuppressant is a tolerizing peptide vaccine.<br>
In one embodiment, the immunostimulatory nucleic acid is administered concurrently<br>
with the asthma/allergy medicament. In another embodiment, the subject is an<br>
20 immunocompromised subject.<br>
Immunostimulatory nucleic acids can be combined with yet other therapeutic agents<br>
such as adjuvants to enhance immune responses. The immunostimulatory nucleic acid and<br>
other therapeutic agent may be administered simultaneously or sequentially. When the other<br>
therapeutic agents are administered simultaneously they can be administered in the same or<br>
25 separate formulations, but are administered at the same time. The other therapeutic agents are<br>
administered sequentially with one another and with immunostimulatory nucleic acid, when<br>
the administration of the other therapeutic agents and the immunostimulatory nucleic acid is<br>
temporally separated. The separation in time between the administration of these compounds<br>
may be a matter of minutes or it may be longer. Other therapeutic agents include but are not<br>
30 limited to adjuvants, cytokines, antibodies, antigens, etc.<br>
The compositions of the invention may also comprise a non-nucleic acid adjuvants. A<br>
non-nucleic acid adjuvant is any molecule or compound except for the immunostimulatory<br>
nucleic acids described herein which can stimulate the humoral and/or cellular immune<br>
response. Non-nucleic acid adjuvants include, for instance, adjuvants that create a depot<br>
effect, immune stimulating adjuvants, and adjuvants that create a depot effect and stimulate<br>
the immune system.<br>
5 An adjuvant that creates a depot effect as used herein is an adjuvant that causes the<br>
antigen to be slowly released in the body, thus prolonging the exposure of immune cells to the<br>
antigen. This class of adjuvants includes but is not limited to alum (e.g., aluminum<br>
hydroxide, aluminum phosphate); or emulsion-based formulations including mineral oil, non-<br>
mineral oil, water-in-oil or oil-in-water-in oil emulsion, oil-in-water emulsions such as Seppic<br>
10 ISA series of Montanide adjuvants (e.g., Montanide ISA 720, AirLiquide, Paris, France); MF-<br>
59 (a squalene-in-water emulsion stabilized with Span 85 and Tween 80; Chiron Corporation,<br>
Emeryville, CA; and PROVAX (an oil-in-water emulsion containing a stabilizing detergent<br>
and a micelle-forming agent; IDEC, Pharmaceuticals Corporation, San Diego, CA).<br>
An immune stimulating adjuvant is an adjuvant that causes activation of a cell of the<br>
15 immune system. It may, for instance, cause an immune cell to produce and secrete cytokines.<br>
This class of adjuvants includes but is not limited to saponins purified from the bark of the Q.<br>
saponaria tree, such as QS21 (a glycolipid that elutes in the 21st peak with HPLC<br>
fractionation; Aquila Biopharmaceuticals, Inc., Worcester, MA);<br>
poly[di(carboxylatophenoxy)phosphazene (PCPP polymer; Virus Research Institute, USA);<br>
20 derivatives of lipopolysaccharides such as monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL; Ribi<br>
ImmunoChem Research, Inc., Hamilton, MT), muramyl dipeptide (MDP; Ribi) and threonyl-<br>
muramyl dipeptide (t-MDP; Ribi); OM-174 (a glucosamine disaccharide related to lipid A;<br>
OM Pharma SA, Meyrin, Switzerland); and Leishmania elongation factor (a purified<br>
Leishmania protein; Corixa Corporation, Seattle, WA).<br>
25 Adjuvants that create a depot effect and stimulate the immune system are those<br>
compounds which have both of the above- identified functions. This class of adjuvants<br>
includes but is not limited to ISCOMS (immunostimulating complexes which contain mixed<br>
saponins, lipids and form virus-sized particles with pores that can hold antigen; CSL,<br>
Melbourne, Australia); SB-AS2 (SmithKline Beecham adjuvant system #2 which is an oil-in-<br>
30 water emulsion containing MPL and QS21: SmithKline Beecham Biologicals [SBB],<br>
Rixensart, Belgium); SB-AS4 (SmithKline Beecham adjuvant system #4 which contains alum<br>
and MPL; SBB, Belgium); non-ionic block copolymers that form micelles such as CRL 1005<br>
(these contain a linear chain of hydrophobic polyoxypropylene flanked by chains of<br>
polyoxyethylene; Vaxcel, Inc., Norcross, GA); and Syntex Adjuvant Formulation (SAP, an<br>
oil-in-water emulsion containing Tween 80 and a nonionic block copolymer; Syntex<br>
Chemicals, Inc., Boulder, CO).<br>
5 The immunostimulatory nucleic acids are themselves useful as adjuvants for inducing<br>
a humoral immune response. Thus they can be delivered to a subject exposed to an antigen<br>
to produce an enhanced immune response to the antigen.<br>
The immunostimulatory nucleic acids are useful as mucosal adjuvants. It has<br>
previously been discovered that both systemic and mucosal immunity are induced by mucosal<br>
10 delivery of CpG nucleic acids. The systemic immunity induced in response to CpG nucleic<br>
acids included both humoral and cell-mediated responses to specific antigens that were not<br>
capable of inducing systemic immunity when administered alone to the mucosa.<br>
Furthermore, both CpG nucleic acids and cholera toxin (CT, a mucosal adjuvant that induces<br>
a Th2-like response) induced CTL. This was surprising since with systemic irnmunization,<br>
15 the presence of Th2-like antibodies is normally associated with a lack of CTL (Schirmbeck et<br>
al, 1995). Based on the results presented herein it is expected that the immunostimulatory<br>
nucleic acids will function in a similar manner.<br>
Additionally, the immunostimulatory nucleic acids induce a mucosal response at both<br>
local (e.g., lung) and remote (e.g., lower digestive tract) mucosal sites. Significant levels of<br>
20 IgA antibodies are induced at distant mucosal sites by the immunostimulatory nucleic acids.<br>
CT is generally considered to be a highly effective mucosal adjuvant. As has been previously<br>
reported (Snider 1995), CT induces predominantly IgGl isotype of antibodies, which are<br>
indicative of Th2-type response. In contrast, the immunostimulatory nucleic acids are more<br>
Thl with predominantly IgG2a antibodies, especially after boost or when the two adjuvants<br>
25 are combined. Thl-type antibodies in general have better neutralizing capabilities, and<br>
furthermore, a Th2 response in the lung is highly undesirable because it is associated with<br>
asthma (Kay, 1996, Hogg, 1997). Thus the use of immunostimulatory nucleic acids as a<br>
mucosal adjuvant has benefits that other mucosal adjuvants cannot achieve. The<br>
immunostimulatory nucleic acids of the invention also are useful as mucosal adjuvants for<br>
30 induction of both a systemic and a mucosal immune response.<br>
Mucosal adjuvants referred to as non-nucleic acid mucosal adjuvants may also be<br>
administered with the immunostimulatory nucleic acids. A non-nucleic acid mucosal<br>
adjuvant as used herein is an adjuvant other than a immunostimulatory nucleic acid that is<br>
capable of inducing a mucosal immune response in a subject when administered to a mucosal<br>
surface in conjunction with an antigen. Mucosal adjuvants include but are not limited to<br>
Bacterial toxins e.g., Cholera toxin (CT), CT derivatives including but not limited to CT B<br>

1998); LTK63 (Ser to Lys) (Marchetti et al., 1998, Douce et al., 1997,1998, Di Tommaso et<br>
al., 1996); and LTR72 (Ala to Arg) (Giuliani et al., 1998), Pertussis toxin, PT. (Lycke et al.,<br>
1992, Spangler BD, 1992, Freytag and Clemments, 1999, Roberts et al., 1995, Wilson et al.,<br>
29 1995) including PT-9K/129G (Roberts et al., 1995, Cropley et al., 1995); Toxin derivatives<br>
(see below) (Holmgren et al., 1993, Verweij et al., 1998, Rappuoli et al., 1995, Freytag and<br>
Clements, 1999); Lipid A derivatives (e.g., monophosphoryl lipid A, MPL) (Sasaki et al.,<br>
1998, Vancott et al., 1998; Muramyl Dipeptide (MDP) derivatives (Fukushiraa et al., 1996,<br>
Ogawa et al., 1989, Michalek et al., 1983, Morisaki et al., 1983); Bacterial outer membrane<br>

membrane protine ofNeisseria meningitidis) (Marinaro et al., 1999, Van de Verg et al.,<br>
1996); Oil-in-water emulsions (e.g., MF59) (Barchfield et al., 1999, Verschoor et al., 1999,<br>
O'Hagan, 1998); Aluminum salts (Isaka et al., 1998,1999); and Saponins (e.g., QS21)<br>
Antigenics, Inc., Woburn, MA) (Sasaki et al., 1998, MacNeal et al., 1998), ISCOMS, MF-59<br>
30 (a squalene-in-water emulsion stabilized with Span 85 and Tween 80; Chiron Corporation,<br>
Emeryville, CA); the Seppic ISA series of Montanide adjuvants (e.g., Montanide ISA 720;<br>
AirLiquide, Paris, France); PROVAX (an oil-in-water emulsion containing a stabilizing<br>

Syntex Adjuvant Formulation (SAF; Syntex Chemicals, Inc., Boulder, CO);<br>
poly[di(carboxylatophenoxy)phosphazene (PCPP polymer; Virus Research Institute, USA)<br>
and Leishmania elongation factor (Corixa Corporation, Seattle, WA).<br>
5 Immune responses can also be induced or augmented by the co-administration or co-<br>
linear expression of cytokines (Bueler &amp; Mulligan, 1996; Chow et al, 1997; Geissler et<br>
al, 1997; Iwasaki et al, 1997; Kim et al, 1997) or B-7 co-stimulatory molecules (Iwasaki et<br>
al, 1997; Tsuji et al, 1997) with the immunostimulatory nucleic acids. The cytokines can be<br>
administered directly with immunostimulatory nucleic acids or may be administered in the<br>
10 form of a nucleic acid vector that encodes the cytokine, such that the cytokine can be<br>
expressed in vivo. In one embodiment, the cytokine is administered in the form of a plasmid<br>
expression vector. The term cytokine is used as a generic name for a diverse group of soluble<br>
proteins and peptides which act as humoral regulators at nano- to picomolar concentrations<br>
and which, either under normal or pathological conditions, modulate the functional activities<br>
15 of individual cells and tissues. These proteins also mediate interactions between cells directly<br>
and regulate processes taking place in the extracellular environment.<br>
Examples of cytokines include, but are not limited to EL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-<br>
7, IL-10, IL-12, IL-15, IL-18, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF),<br>
granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), interferon-y (y-IFN), IFN-cc, tumor necrosis<br>
20 factor (TNF), TGF-ß, FLT-3 ligand, and CD40 ligand.<br>
Cytokines play a role in directing the T cell response. Helper (CD4+) T cells<br>
orchestrate the immune response of mammals through production of soluble factors that act<br>
on other immune system cells, including other T cells. Most mature CD4+ T helper cells<br>
express one of two cytokine profiles: Thl or Th2. The Thl subset promotes delayed-type<br>
25 hypersensitivity, cell-mediated immunity, and immunoglobulin class switching to IgG2a- The<br>
Th2 subset induces humoral immunity by activating B cells, promoting antibody production,<br>
and inducing class switching to IgGi and IgE. In some embodiments, it is preferred that the<br>
cytokine be a Thl cytokine.<br>
The immunostimulatory nucleic acids may be directly administered to the subject or<br>
30 may be administered in conjunction with a nucleic acid delivery complex. A nucleic acid<br>
delivery complex shall mean a nucleic acid molecule associated with (e.g. ionically or<br>
covalently bound to; or encapsulated within) a targeting means (e.g. a molecule that results in<br>
higher affinity binding to target cell (e.g., B cell surfaces and/or increased cellular uptake by<br>
target cells). Examples of nucleic acid delivery complexes include nucleic acids associated<br>
with a sterol (e.g. cholesterol), a lipid (e.g. a cationic lipid, virosome or liposome), or a target<br>
cell specific binding agent (e.g. a Iigand recognized by target cell specific receptor). Preferred<br>
5 complexes may be sufficiently stable in vivo to prevent significant uncoupling prior to<br>
internalization by the target cell. However, the complex can be cleavable under appropriate<br>
conditions within the cell so that the nucleic acid is released in a functional form.<br>
Delivery vehicles or delivery devices for delivering antigen and nucleic acids to<br>
surfaces have been described. The Immunostimulatory nucleic acid and/or the antigen and/or<br>
10 other therapeutics may be administered alone (e.g., in saline or buffer) or using any delivery<br>
vehicles known in the art. For instance the following delivery vehicles have been described:<br>
Cochleates (Gould-Fogerite et al., 1994, 1996); Emulsomes (Vancott et al., 1998, Lowell et<br>
al., 1997); ISCOMs (Mowat et al., 1993, Carlsson et al., 1991, Hu et., 1998, Morein et al.,<br>
1999); Liposomes (Childers et al., 1999, Michalek et al., 1989,1992, de Haan 1995a, 1995b);<br>

et al., 1993, Kuklin et al., 1997, Sasaki et al., 1998, Okada et al., 1997, Ishii et al., 1997);<br>
Polymers (e.g. carboxymethylcellulose, chitosan) (Hamajima et al., 1998, Jabbal-Gill et al.,<br>

delivery vehicles are known in the art and some additional examples are provided below in<br>
the discussion of vectors.<br>
The stimulation index of a particular immunostimulatory nucleic acid can be tested in<br>
30 various immune cell assays. Preferably, the stimulation index of the immunostimulatory<br>
nucleic acid with regard to B cell proliferation is at least about 5, preferably at least about 10,<br>
more preferably at least about 15 and most preferably at least about 20 as determined by<br>
incorporation of 3H uridine in a murine B cell culture, which has been contacted with 20 uM<br>
of nucleic acid for 20h at 37°C and has been pulsed with 1 uCi of 3H uridine; and harvested<br>
and counted 4h later as described in detail in PCT Published Patent Applications<br>
PCT/US95/01570 (WO 96/02555) and PCT/US97/19791 (WO 98/18810) claiming priority to<br>
5 U.S. Serial Nos. 08/386,063 and 08/960,774, filed on February 7,1995 and October 30,1997<br>
respectively. For use in vivo, for example, it is important that the immunostimulatory nucleic<br>
acids be capable of effectively inducing an immune response, such as, for example, antibody<br>
production.<br>
Immunostimulatory nucleic acids are effective in non-rodent vertebrate. Different<br>
10 immunostimulatory nucleic acid can cause optimal immune stimulation depending on the type<br>
of subject and the sequence of the immunostimulatory nucleic acid. Many vertebrates have<br>
been found according to the invention to be responsive to the same class of<br>
immunostimulatory nucleic acids, sometimes referred to as human specific<br>
immunostimulatory nucleic acids. Rodents, however, respond to different nucleic acids. As<br>
15 shown herein an immunostimulatory nucleic acid causing optimal stimulation in humans may<br>
not generally cause optimal stimulation in a mouse and vice versa. An immunostimulatory<br>
nucleic acid causing optimal stimulation in humans often does, however, cause optimal<br>
stimulation in other animals such as cow, horses, sheep, etc. One of skill in the art can identify<br>
the optimal nucleic acid sequences useful for a particular species of interest using routine<br>
20 assays described herein and/or known in the art, using the guidance supplied herein.<br>
The term effective amount of a immunostimulatory nucleic acid refers to the amount<br>
necessary or sufficient to realize a desired biologic effect. For example, an effective amount<br>
of a immunostimulatory nucleic acid for inducing mucosal immunity is that amount necessary<br>
to cause the development of IgA in response to an antigen upon exposure to the antigen,<br>
25 whereas that amount required for inducing systemic immunity is that amount necessary to<br>
cause the development of IgG in response to an antigen upon exposure to the antigen.<br>
Combined with the teachings provided herein, by choosing among the various active<br>
compounds and weighing factors such as potency, relative bioavailability, patient body<br>
weight, severity of adverse side-effects and preferred mode of administration, an effective<br>
30 prophylactic or therapeutic treatment regimen can be planned which does not cause<br>
substantial toxicity and yet is entirely effective to treat the particular subject. The effective<br>
amount for any particular application can vary depending on such factors as the disease or<br>
condition being treated, the particular immunostimulatory nucleic acid being administered,<br>
the antigen, the size of the subject, or the'severity of the disease or condition. One of ordinary<br>
skill in the art can empirically determine the effective amount of a particular<br>
immunostimulatory nucleic acid and/or antigen and/or other therapeutic agent without<br>
5 necessitating undue experimentation.<br>
Subject doses of the compounds described herein for mucosal or local delivery<br>
typically range from about 0.1mg to 10 mg per administration, which depending on the<br>
application could be given daily, weekly, or monthly and any other amount of time<br>
therebetween. More typically mucosal or local doses range from about 10 ug to 5 mg per<br>
10 administration, and most typically from about 100 ug to 1 mg, with 2-4 administrations<br>
being spaced days or weeks apart. More typically, immune stimulant doses range from 1 ug<br>
to 10 mg per administration, and most typically 10 ug to 1 mg, with daily or weekly<br>
administrations. Subject doses of the compounds described herein for parenteral delivery for<br>
the purpose of inducing an antigen-specific immune response, wherein the compounds are<br>
15 delivered with an antigen but not another therapeutic agent are typically 5 to 10,000 times<br>
higher than the effective mucosal dose for vaccine adjuvant or immune stimulant applications,<br>
and more typically 10 to 1,000 times higher, and most typically 20 to 100 tunes higher.<br>
Doses of the compounds described herein for parenteral delivery for the purpose of inducing<br>
an innate immune response or for increasing ADCC or for inducing an antigen specific<br>
20 immune response when the immunostimulatory nucleic acids are administered in combination<br>
with other therapeutic agents or in specialized delivery vehicles typically range from about<br>
0.1 |iig to 10 mg per administration, which depending on the application could be given daily,<br>
weekly, or monthly and any other amount of time therebetween. More typically parenteral<br>
doses for these purposes range from about 10 ug to 5 mg per administration, and most<br>
25 typically from about 100 |j.g to 1 mg, with 2-4 administrations being spaced days or weeks<br>
apart. In some embodiments, however, parenteral doses for these purposes may be used in a<br>
range of 5 to 10,000 times higher than the typical doses described above.<br>
For any compound described herein the therapeutically effective amount can be<br>
initially determined from animal models. A therapeutically effective dose can also be<br>
30 determined from human data for CpG oligonucleotides which have been tested in humans<br>
(human clinical trials have been initiated) and for compounds which are known to exhibit<br>
similar pharmacological activities, such as other mucosal adjuvants, e.g., LT and other<br>
antigens for vaccination purposes, for the mucosal or local administration. Higher doses are<br>
required for parenteral administration. The applied dose can be adjusted based on the relative<br>
bioavailability and potency of the administered compound. Adjusting the dose to achieve<br>
maximal efficacy based on the methods described above and other methods as are well-known<br>
5 in the art is well within the capabilities of the ordinarily skilled artisan.<br>
The formulations of the invention are administered in pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
solutions, which may routinely contain pharmaceutically acceptable concentrations of salt,<br>
buffering agents, preservatives, compatible carriers, adjuvants, and optionally other<br>
therapeutic ingredients.<br>
10 For use in therapy, an effective amount of the immunostimulatory nucleic acid can be<br>
administered to a subject by any mode that delivers the nucleic acid to the desired surface,<br>
e.g., mucosal, systemic. Administering the pharmaceutical composition of the present<br>
invention may be accomplished by any means known to the skilled artisan. Preferred routes<br>
of administration include but are not limited to oral, parenteral, intramuscular, intranasal,<br>
15 intratracheal, inhalation, ocular, vaginal, and rectal.<br>
For oral administration, the compounds (i.e., immunostimulatory nucleic acids,<br>
antigens and other therapeutic agents) can be formulated readily by combining the active<br>
compound(s) with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers well laiown in the art. Such carriers<br>
enable the compounds of the invention to be formulated as tablets, pills, dragees, capsules,<br>
20 liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions and the like, for oral ingestion by a subject to be<br>
treated. Pharmaceutical preparations for oral use can be obtained as solid excipient,<br>
optionally grinding a resulting mixture, and processing the mixture of granules, after adding<br>
suitable auxiliaries, if desired, to obtain tablets or dragee cores. Suitable excipients are, in<br>
particular, fillers such as sugars, including lactose, sucrose, mannitol, or sorbitol; cellulose<br>
25 preparations such as, for example, maize starch, wheat starch, rice starch, potato starch,<br>
gelatin, gum tragacanth, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, sodium<br>
carboxymethylcellulose, and/or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). If desired, disintegrating agents<br>
may be added, such as the cross-linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, agar, or alginic acid or a salt<br>
thereof such as sodium alginate. Optionally the oral formulations may also be formulated in<br>
30 saline or buffers for neutralizing internal acid conditions or may be administered without any<br>
carriers.<br>
Dragee cores are provided with suitable coatings. For this purpose, concentrated sugar<br>
solutions may be used, which may optionally contain gum arabic, talc, polyvinyl pyrrolidone,<br>
carbopol gel, polyethylene glycol, and/or titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions, and suitable<br>
organic solvents or solvent mixtures. Dyestuffs or pigments may be added to the tablets or<br>
5 dragee coatings for identification or to characterize different combinations of active<br>
compound doses.<br>
Pharmaceutical preparations which can be used orally include push-fit capsules made<br>
of gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a plasticizer, such as glycerol<br>
or sorbitol. The push-fit capsules can contain the active ingredients in admixture with filler<br>
10 such as lactose, binders such as starches, and/or lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate<br>
and, optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the active compounds may be dissolved or<br>
suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, liquid paraffin, or liquid polyethylene glycols.<br>
In addition, stabilizers may be added. Microspheres formulated for oral administration may<br>
also be used. Such microspheres have been well defined in the art. All formulations for oral<br>
15 administration should be in dosages suitable for such administration.<br>
For buccal administration, the compositions may take the form of tablets or lozenges<br>
formulated in conventional manner.<br>
For administration by inhalation, the compounds for use according to the present<br>
invention may be conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from<br>
20 pressurized packs or a nebulizer, with the use of a suitable propellant, e.g.,<br>
dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrailuoroethane, carbon dioxide<br>
or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol the dosage unit may be determined<br>
by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges of e.g. gelatin for<br>
use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a powder mix of the compound<br>
25 and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.<br>
The compounds, when it is desirable to deliver them systemically, may be formulated<br>
for parenteral administration by injection, e.g., by bolus injection or continuous infusion.<br>
Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in<br>
multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as<br>
30 suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory<br>
agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations forparenteral administration include aqueous solutions<br>
of the active compounds in water-soluble form. Additionally, suspensions of the active<br>
compounds may be prepared as appropriate oily injection suspensions. Suitable lipophilic<br>
solvents or vehicles include fatty oils such as sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, such as<br>
5 ethyl oleate or triglycerides, or liposomes. Aqueous injection suspensions may contain<br>
substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension, such as sodium carboxymethyl<br>
cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran. Optionally, the suspension may also contain suitable stabilizers<br>
or agents which increase the solubility of the compounds to allow for the preparation of<br>
highly concentrated solutions.<br>
10 Alternatively, the active compounds may be in powder form for constitution with a<br>
suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile pyrogen-free water, before use.<br>
The compounds may also be formulated in rectal or vaginal compositions such as<br>
suppositories or retention enemas, e.g., containing conventional suppository bases such as<br>
cocoa butter or other glycerides.<br>
15 In addition to the formulations described previously, the compounds may also be<br>
formulated as a depot preparation. Such long acting formulations may be formulated with<br>
suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example as an emulsion in an acceptable oil)<br>
or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, for example, as a sparingly soluble<br>
salt.<br>
20 The pharmaceutical compositions also may comprise suitable solid or gel phase<br>
carriers or excipients. Examples of such carriers or excipients include but are not limited to<br>
calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, various sugars, starches, cellulose derivatives, gelatin,<br>
and polymers such as polyethylene glycols.<br>
Suitable liquid or solid pharmaceutical preparation forms are, for example, aqueous or<br>
25 saline solutions for inhalation, microencapsulated, encochleated, coated onto microscopic<br>
gold particles, contained in liposomes, nebulized, aerosols, pellets for implantation into the<br>
skin, or dried onto a sharp object to be scratched into the skin. The pharmaceutical<br>
compositions also include granules, powders, tablets, coated tablets, (micro)capsules,<br>
suppositories, syrups, emulsions, suspensions, creams, drops or preparations with protracted<br>
30 release of active compounds, in whose preparation excipients and additives and/or auxiliaries<br>
such as disintegrants, binders, coating agents, swelling agents, lubricants, flavorings,<br>
sweeteners or solubilizers are customarily used as described above. The pharmaceutical<br>
compositions are suitable for use in a variety of drug delivery systems. For a brief review of<br>
methods for drug delivery, see Langer, Science 249:1527-1533,1990, which is incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
The immunostimulatory nucleic acids and optionally other therapeutics and/or<br>
5 antigens may be administered per se (neat) or in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salt. When used in medicine the salts should be pharmaceutically acceptable, but non-<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts may conveniently be used to prepare pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts thereof. Such salts include, but are not limited to, those prepared from the<br>
following acids: hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulphuric, nitric, phosphoric, maleic, acetic,<br>
10 salicylic, p-toluene sulphonic, tartaric, citric, methane sulphonic, formic, malonic, succinic,<br>
naphthalene-2-sulphonic, and benzene sulphonic. Also, such salts can be prepared as alkaline<br>
metal or alkaline earth salts, such as sodium, potassium or calcium salts of the carboxylic acid<br>
group.<br>
Suitable buffering agents include: acetic acid and a salt (1-2% w/v); citric acid and a<br>
15 salt (1-3% v/v); boric acid and a salt (0.5-2.5% w/v); and phosphoric acid and a salt (0.8-2%<br>
w/v). Suitable preservatives include benzalkonium chloride (0.003-0.03% w/v);<br>
chlorobutanol (0.3-0.9% w/v); parabens (0.01-0.25% w/v) and thimerosal (0.004-0.02% w/v).<br>
As described in greater detail herein, the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention<br>
contain an effective amount of a immunostimulatory nucleic acid and optionally antigens<br>
20 and/or other therapeutic agents optionally included in a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier.<br>
The term pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier means one or more compatible solid or liquid<br>
filler, diluents or encapsulating substances which are suitable for administration to a human or<br>
other vertebrate animal. The term carrier denotes an organic or inorganic ingredient, natural<br>
or synthetic, with which the active ingredient is combined to facilitate the application. The<br>
25 components of the pharmaceutical compositions also are capable of being commingled with<br>
the compounds of the present invention, and with each other, in a manner such that there is no<br>
interaction which would substantially impair the desired pharmaceutical efficiency.<br>
The immunostimulatory nucleic acids useful in the invention may be delivered in<br>
mixtures with additional adjuvant(s), other therapeutics, or antigen(s). A mixture may consist<br>
30 of several adjuvants in addition to the immunostimulatory nucleic acid or several antigens or<br>
other therapeutics.<br>
A variety of administration routes are available. The particular mode selected will<br>
depend, of course, upon the particular adjuvants or antigen selected, the particular condition<br>
being treated and the dosage required for therapeutic efficacy. The methods of this invention,<br>
generally speaking, may be practiced using any mode of administration that is medically<br>
5 acceptable, meaning any mode that produces effective levels of an immune response without<br>
causing clinically unacceptable adverse effects. Preferred modes of administration are<br>
discussed above.<br>
The compositions may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be<br>
prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. All methods include the<br>
10 step of bringing the compounds into association with a carrier which constitutes one or more<br>
accessory ingredients. In general, the compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately<br>
bringing the compounds into association with a liquid carrier, a finely divided solid carrier, or<br>
both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product. Liquid dose units are vials or ampoules.<br>
Solid dose units are tablets, capsules and suppositories. For treatment of a patient, depending<br>
75 on activity of the compound, manner of administration, purpose of the immunization (i.e.,<br>
prophylactic or therapeutic), nature and severity of the disorder, age and body weight of the<br>
patient, different doses may be necessary. The administration of a given dose can be carried<br>
out both by single administration in the form of an individual dose unit or else several smaller<br>
dose units. Multiple administration of doses at specific intervals of weeks or months apart is<br>
20 usual for boosting the antigen-specific responses.<br>
Other delivery systems can include time-release, delayed release or sustained release<br>
delivery systems. Such systems can avoid repeated administrations of the compounds,<br>
increasing convenience to the subject and the physician. Many types of release delivery<br>
systems are available and known to those of ordinary skill in the art. They include polymer<br>
25 base systems such as poly(lactide-glycolide), copolyoxalates, polycaprolactones,<br>
polyesteramides, polyorthoesters, polyhydroxybutyric acid, and polyanhydrides.<br>
Microcapsules of the foregoing polymers containing drugs are described in, for<br>
example, U.S. Patent 5,075,109. Delivery systems also include non-polymer systems that are:<br>
lipids including sterols such as cholesterol, cholesterol esters and fatty acids or neutral fats<br>
30 such as mono-di-and tri-glycerides; hydrogel release systems; sylastic systems; peptide based<br>
systems; wax coatings; compressed tablets using conventional binders and excipients;<br>
partially fused implants; and the like. Specific examples include, but are not limited to: (a)<br>
erosional systems in which an agent of the invention is contained in a form within a matrix<br>
such as those described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,452,775,4,675,189, and 5,736,152, and (b)<br>
diffusional systems hi which an active component permeates at a controlled rate from a<br>
polymer such as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,854,480, 5,133,974 and 5,407,686. In<br>
5 addition, pump-based hardware delivery systems can be used, some of which are adapted for<br>
implantation.<br>

EXAMPLE 1 (ODN 10102);<br>
IS Summary:<br>
This resport summarizes in vitro data with human cells demonstrating that ODN<br>
10102 (SEQ ID NO:1) behaves similarly and in some aspects in a superior manner to ODN<br>
7909 (SEQ ID NO:2). In vitro and in vivo data in mice demonstrating that CpG ODN 10102<br>
has similar and sometimes better properties as compared to CpG ODN 7909 for activation of<br>
20 fee innate immune system, and for augmenting humoral and cellular HBsAg-specific<br>
responses in mice when coadministered wife fee antigen.<br>
The assays performed were receptor engagement (TLR9), B cell activation (expression<br>
of cell surface activation marker and B cell proliferation) and cytokine secretion (IL-10, IP-<br>
10, IFN-alpha and TNF-alpha). All assays demonstrated feat ODN 10102 has properties feat<br>
25 are almost identical if not better to ODN 7909.<br>
In vitro studies (i.e. B cell proliferation assays, NK lytic activity, cytokine secretion<br>
profiles) were carried out using naive BALB/c mouse splenocytes. In vivo comparison studies<br>
were carried out by examining fee potential of these two ODNs to enhance antigen specific<br>
immune responses to hepatitis B antigen (HBsAg).<br><br>
Materials and Methods:<br>
Human Studies:<br>
Oligodeoxynucleotides: All ODNs were provided by Coley Pharmaceutical GmbH<br>
(Langenfeld, Germany). The control ODN contained no stimulatory CpG motif. ODNs<br>
5 were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline, and stored at -20° C. All dilutions were carried<br>
out using pyrogen-free reagents.<br>
TLR9 assay: Cells used for this assay expressed the human TLR9 receptor and contained a<br>
reporter gene construct. Cells were incubated with ODNs for 16h. Each data point was done<br>
10 in triplicate. Cells were lysed and assayed for reporter gene activity. Stimulation indices<br>
were calculated in reference to reporter gene activity of medium without addition of ODN.<br>
Cell purification: Peripheral blood buffy coat preparations from healthy human donors<br>
were obtained from the German Red Cross (Rathingen, Germany) and from these, PBMC<br>
15 were purified by centrifugation over Ficoll-Hypaque (Sigma, Germany). The purified<br>
PBMC were either used fresh or were suspended in freezing medium and stored at -70° C.<br>
When required, aliquots of these cells were thawed, washed and resuspended in RPMI1640<br>
culture medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat inactivated FCS, 1.5mM L-glutamine,<br>
lOOU/ml penicillin and lOOug/ml streptomycin.<br>
20<br>
Cytokine detection: Thawed or fresh PBMC were resuspended at a concentration of<br>
5xlO6/ml and added to 48 well flat-bottomed plates (lml/well), which had previously<br>
received nothing or ODN in a variety of concentrations. The cells were cultured in a<br>
humidified incubator at 37 °C. Culture superaatants were collected after the indicated time<br>
25 points. If not used immediately, supernatants were frozen at -20°C until required. Amounts<br>
of cytokines in the supernatants were assessed using commercially available ELISA Kits (IL-<br>
10; Diaclone, USA) or in-house ELISAs (IP-10 and IFN-a) developed using commercially<br>
available antibodies (from Pharmingen or PBL; Germany or USA, respectively).<br>
30 Cultures for flow cytometric analysis of B cell activation: Monoclonal antibodies to<br>
CD19 and CD86 were purchased from Becton Dickinson (Germany). PBMC were incubated<br>
WO 2004/005476 PCT/US2003/021113<br>
-108-<br>
for 48 hours with or without the addition of different concentrations of ODNs. B cells were<br>
identified by expression of CD19 by flow cytometry. Flow cytometric data were acquired<br>
on a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson). Data were analyzed using the computer program<br>
CellQuest (Becton Dickinson). Proliferating CD19 positive B cells were identified after<br>
5 culturing CFSE-labelled PBMC (CFSE is a fluorescing dye binding to all cell surfaces) by<br>
decreased CFSE content using flow cytometry methodology (see above).<br>
Murine In Vitro/In Vivo Studies:<br>
Oligodeoxynucleotides: CpG ODN (GMP quality) were supplied by Coley Pharmaceutical<br>
Inc. (Wellesley, MA). All ODN were resuspended in sterile, endotoxin free TE at pH 8.0<br>
10 (OmniPer®; EM S cience, Gibbstown, NJ) and stored and handle under aseptic conditions<br>
to prevent both microbial and endotoxin contamination. Dilution of ODNs for assays was<br>
carried out in sterile, endotoxin free PBS a pH 7.2 (Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis,<br>
MO).<br>
15 Animals: Female BALB/c mice (6-8 weeks of age) were used for all experiments. Animals<br>
were purchased from Charles River Canada (Quebec, Canada) and housed in micro isolators<br>
at the animal care facility of the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Civic Site.<br>
Splenocyte harvest and culture: Naive BAL B/c mouse splenocytes were used for all in<br>
vitro assays. Animals were anesthetized with isofluorane and euthanized by cervical<br>
20 dislocation. Spleens were removed under aseptic conditions and placed in PBS + 0.2%<br>
bovine serum albumin (Sigma Chemical Company). Spleens were then homogenized and<br>
splenocytes were re-suspended in RPMI1640 (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) tissue<br>
culture medium supplemented with 2% normal mouse serum (Cedarlane Laboratories,<br>
Ontario, Canada), penicillin-streptomycin solution (final concentration of 1000 U/ml and 1<br>
25 mg/ml respectively; Sigma Chemical Company), and 5 X 10'5 M p-mercaptoethanol (Sigma<br>
Chemical Company).<br>
B cell proliferation assays: Spleen cell suspensions were prepared and adjusted to a final<br>
concentration of 5 X 106 cells per ml in complete RPMI 1640. Splenocyte suspension was<br>
plated onto 96-well U-bottom tissue culture plates (100 pl/well) along with 100 \A of each<br>
stimulant diluted to appropriate concentrations in complete RPMI 1640. The stimulants used<br>
were CpG ODN (at 1, 3, 10 mg/ml) 7909 and 10102, 10103, 10104, 10105 or 10106.<br>
Concanavalin A (10 jig/ml, Sigma Chemical Company) and LPS (10 jig/ml, Sigma<br>
Chemical Company) were used as positive controls and cells cultured with media alone were<br>
5 used as negative controls. Each splenocyte sample was plated in triplicate and cells were<br>
incubated in a humidified 5% COZ incubator at 37°C for 96 hr. At the end of the incubation<br>
period, cells were pulsed with 3H-thymidine (20 u-Ci/ml) at 96 hr post incubation for 16<br>
hours, harvested and measured for radioactivity.<br>
'0 Cytokine secretion profiles: Spleen cell suspensions were prepared and plated in 96-well<br>
U-bottom tissue culture plates as described for B cell proliferation assays. Each splenocyte<br>
sample was plated in triplicate and the cells were incubated in a humidified 5 % CO2<br>
incubator at 37°C for 6, 12 or 48 hr. At the end of the incubation period, 96-well plates were<br>
centrifuged for 5 min at 1200 rpm and culture supernatants harvested and stored at -80°C<br>
15 until assayed. Commercially available assay kits (mouse OptEIA kits; PharMingen,<br>
Mississauga, ON) were used according to manufacturers instructions to assay cytokine levels<br>
in culture supernatants taken at 6 hr (TNF-alpha), 24 hr (IL-12) and 48 hr QL-6 and IL-10).<br>
NK assays: Splenocyte suspensions were prepared as described previously and adjusted to<br>
20 a final concentration of 3 X 105 cells per ml in complete RPMI 1640. Splenocyte suspension<br>
(10 ml; 30 x 106 cells) was plated in T-25 tissue culture flasks (Fisher Scientific, Ottawa,<br>
ON) along with either CpG ODN (at 1, 3, 10 ug/ml) 7909 and 10102, 10103, 10104, 10105<br>
or 10106. Splenocytes cultured with media alone were used as negative controls. Each<br>
splenocyte culture was incubated in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C for 24 hr. At the<br>
25 end of the incubation period, cells were plated at different effectontarget ratios onto 96-well<br>
U-bottom tissue culture plates (100 ul/well) along with 100 ul of 51Cr labeled target cells at<br>
5 x 104 cells/ml. NK sensitive mouse lymphoma cell line YAC-1 (ATCC # TIB-160, ATCC,<br>
Manassas, VA) was used as the target cell line. Each sample was plated in triplicate and the<br>
cells were incubated in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C for 4 hr. Target cells were<br>
30 incubated with media alone or with 2N HC1 to determine spontaneous release and maximum<br>
release respectively. At the end of the incubation period, supernatants were harvested and<br>
radioactivity levels were determined using a gamma counter. The % lysis was determined<br>
using the following formula;<br>
% specific release = experimental release - spontaneous release x 100<br>
maximum release - spontaneous release<br>
5<br>
Immunization of mice: BALB/c mice (n=10/group) were immunized with 1 ug HBsAg<br>
sub type ad (International Enzymes, CA) alone or in combination with either 10 u.g CpG<br>
ODN 7909 or CpG ODN 10102, 10103, 10104, 10105 or 10106. Animals were bled and<br>
boosted at 4 weeks post-primary immunization. At 1 week post boost 5 animals from each<br>
10 group was euthanized and spleens removed for CTL assays.<br>
Determination of antibody responses: Antibodies (total IgG, IgGl and IgG2a) specific to<br>
HBsAg (anti-HBs) were detected and quantified by endpoint dilution ELISA assay, which<br>
was performed in triplicate on samples from individual animals. End-point titers were<br>
15 defined as the highest plasma dilution that resulted in an absorbance value (OD 450) two<br>
times greater than that of non-immune plasma with a cut-off value of 0.05. These were<br>
reported as group mean titers ± SEM.<br>
Statistical analysis: Statistical analysis was performed using InStat program (Graph PAD<br>
20 Software, San Diego). The statistical difference between groups were determined by<br>
Student's t test (for two groups) or by 1-factor ANOVA followed by Tukey's test (for three<br>
or more groups) on raw data or transformed data (logio. for heteroscedastic populations).<br>
Results:<br>
25 TLR9 engagement: Recently the receptor for the recognition of CpG sequences was<br>
identified and shown to be a member of the Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) family (Hemmi et<br>
al., 2000). This receptor, TLR9, is readily activated by ODNs containing optimal<br>
immunostimulatory CpG sequences. We incubated a cell line stably expressing the human<br>
TLR9 with different concentrations of ODNs 7909 and 10102 as well as a control ODN<br>
30 (Fig. 1).<br>
The results demonstrate that there ODN 10102 activated TLR9 as well as or better<br>
than ODN 7909. Both ODNs showed the same dose-response curve and reached maximum<br>
activation at the same concentrations. The control ODN used did not induce TLR9 activation<br>
even at the highest concentration of 12 mg/ml.<br>
Human B cells: One characteristic of type B ODNs is their ability to very efficiently<br>
5 activate B cells (Krieg et al., 1995). B cells and plasmacytoid DC are at the moment the<br>
only immune cell types known to express TLR9 (Krug et al., 2001; Bauer et al., 2001).<br>
We, therefore, measured the direct activation of B cells induced by ODNs 7909 and 10102<br>
by: a. up regulation of the cell surface marker CD86 (Fig. 2), and b. measuring the<br>
proliferation of B cells (Fig. 3). For CD86 expression on human B cells PBMC of healthy<br>
10 blood donors were incubated with different ODNs and B cell activation measured as<br>
described in Materials and Methods.<br>
Both results demonstrate that 10102 as well as 7909 are very potent stimulators of<br>
human B cells. Fig. 2 shows that these CpG ODNs were capable to stimulate B cells at an in<br>
vitro concentration of only 0.4mg/ml. The plateau was reached at about 1.6mg/ml. A similar<br>
15 result was obtained for the induction of B cell proliferation (Fig. 3), here the stimulation index<br>
reached a maximum at about 1.6 mg/ml.<br>
Cytokine secretion: ODNs of the B class lead to a Thl dominated immune response in<br>
vivo as well as in vitro. It was found that they are capable to induce typical Thl cytokines<br>
20 such as IFN- and IFN- as well as Thl-related chemokines such as MCP-1 and IP-10. In<br>
addition, low secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 as well as TNF- and<br>
secretion of the negative regulator IL-10 can be observed. We, therefore, measured the<br>
secretion of the Thl cytokine IFN-, the chemokine IP-10 as well as the regulatory cytokine<br>
IL-10 and the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF- . Fig. 4 shows the result for an experiment<br>
25 performed with 3 different donors at 0.2, 0.4, 1.6 and 5mg/ml to measure in vitro IFN-<br>
secretion.<br>
Both CpG ODNs, 7909 as well as 10102, induced high levels of IFN-a with a<br>
maximum reached at 0.4 (7909) or 1.6mg/ml (10102). However, maximal elevation of IFN-a<br>
secretion was more pronounced after stimulation with 10102 in comparison to 7909. hi<br>
30 contrast, the control ODN induced low amounts of IFN-a starting only at 5.0(j.g/ml.<br>
In addition, ODNs 7909 and 10102, in contrast to the control ODN, induced high amounts of<br>
the chemokine EP-10 as shown in Fig. 5.<br>
A very similar experiment was performed for IL-10 secretion (Fig. 6). Again, as<br>
demonstrated above for IFN-a, both CpG ODNs 7909 and 10102 demonstrated almost<br>
identical properties, with 10102 working better in some instance in these assays. In<br>
comparison, the control ODN induces IL-10 secretion only at the highest concentration.<br>
5 As shown in Fig. 7, both ODNs 7909 and 10102 as well as the control ODN showed a<br>
weak secretion profile of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-a in comparison to LPS. Again,<br>
the two ODNs were found to have very similar characteristics also in this assay.<br>
In a first set of experiments, the induction of the proliferation of murine spleen cells<br>
was investigated. According to the data shown in Fig. 8, CpG ODN 10102 is equally potent as<br>
10 CpG ODN 7909 in inducing murine B cell proliferation at all concentrations tested.<br>
In a next set of experiments, the secretion of a variety of cytokines upon incubation of<br>
spleen cells with 10102, 7909 and the control 2137 was tested. According to the data shown<br>
in Fig. 9, both CpG ODN 7909 and 10102 have essentially equal potency in enhancing<br>
cytokine secretion by murine splenocytes.<br>
15 According to the data in Fig. 10, both CpG ODN 7909 and 10102 have essentially<br>
equal potency in enhancing lytic activity of NK cells in mouse splenocyte cultures.<br>
According to the results of this study (Fig. 11), use of either CpG ODN 7909 or 10102<br>
significantly enhanced antibody titers against HBsAg compared to antigen alone (p
whereas there was no significant increase in anti-HBs responses when control ODN was used in<br>
20 combination with HBsAg (p=0.86).<br>
The increase in total IgG levels is slightly but significantly (p=0.04) greater when CpG<br>
ODN 7909 used compared to when CpG ODN 10102 is used.<br>
In mice IgG isotype distribution is widely used as an indication of the nature of the<br>
immune response where a high IgG2a/IgGl ratios are indicative of a Thl biased immune<br>
25 response (Constant and Bottomly, 1997). In the present study, the use of CpG ODN<br>
significantly enhanced IgG2a titers compared to when antigen was used alone or in<br>
combination with control ODN 2137 (pO.OOl for Ag vs. 7909 or 10102 or Ag vs. Ag +<br>
2137). However, the level of IgG2a response was similar when either CpG ODN 7909 or<br>
10102 was used in combination with HBsAg (p&gt;0.05). Therefore, both CpG ODN 7909 and<br>
30 10102 are equally potent in their ability to induce Thl biased immune responses as measured<br>
by the increased levels of IgG2a over IgGl.<br>
Conclusion:<br>
In vitro data with human cells demonstrated that the ODN 10102 behaves similarly or<br>
better than previously identified ODN 7909 in a variety of assays performed.<br>
According to the results of the murine in vivo and in vitro studies, CpG ODN 10102<br>
5 has similar or better immune potentiating properties than ODN 7909, both for in vitro effects<br>
on innate immune responses as well as the ability to augment antigen specific responses in<br>
vivo when administered together with an antigen.<br>
EXAMPLE 2 (ODN 10103);<br>
10 Summary:<br>
The in vitro ability of ODN 10103 (SEQ ID NO:19) to stimulate human PBMC was<br>
compared to that of ODN 7909 (SEQ ID NO:2). Immune stimulation was analyzed in terms<br>
of receptor (i.e., TLR9) engagement, B cell activation (e.g., expression of cell surface<br>
activation markers and B cell proliferation), and cytokine secretion (e.g., secretion of IL-10,<br>
15 IP-10, IFN-a and TNF-ot). All assays demonstrated that ODN 10103 has properties similar<br>
to or superior to those of ODN 7909.<br>
The ability of ODN 10103 to stimulate murine immune cells in vitro and in vivo was<br>
compared to that of ODN 7909. In vitro studies (e.g., B cell proliferation assays, NK lytic<br>
activity, and cytokine secretion profiles) were carried out using naive BALB/c mouse<br>
20 splenocytes. In vivo studies were carried out by examining the potential of these two ODNs<br>
to enhance antigen specific immune responses to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), with<br>
both humoral (antibody) and cell mediated immune responses (CTL activity) analyzed. In<br>
addition, the Th-bias of the induced immune response was examined by deterraining the<br>
strength of the CTL response as well as the IgG2a/IgGl ratio.<br>

oligodeoxynucleotides, TLR9 assays, human cell purification, cytokine detection, and cultures<br>

descriptions of oligodeoxynucleotides, animals, splenocyte harvest and culture, B cell<br>

Murine In Vitro/In Vivo Studies:<br>
5 Evaluation of CTL responses: CTL assays were conducted as previously described by<br>
Davis et al. The results are presented as % specific lysis at different effector: target (E:T)<br>
ratios.<br>
Results:<br>
10 TLR9 engagement: We incubated a cell line stably expressing the human TLR9 with<br>
different concentrations of ODNs 7909 and 10103 as well as a control ODN (Fig. 13).<br>
Both ODNs showed a concentration dependent dose-response curve reaching their maximum<br>
activation at the same concentration. A control ODN did not induce TLR9 activation even at<br>
the highest concentration of 24mg/ml. ODN 10103 showed higher stimulation capacity at<br>
75 lower doses than did ODN 7909 (e.g., at 6 and 12 g/ml), suggesting that ODN 10103 can<br>
be used at lower doses to achieve similar immunostimulation indices, and thereby reducing<br>
potential toxicity.<br>
Human B cells: One characteristic of type B ODNs is their ability to very efficiently<br>
20 activate B cells (Krieg et al., 1995). B cells and plasmacytoid DC are at the moment the<br>
only immune cell types known to express TLR9 (Krug et al., 2001; Bauer et al., 2001).<br>
We, therefore, measured the direct activation of B cells induced by ODNs 7909 and 10103<br>
by up regulation of the cell surface marker CD86 (Fig. 14), and measuring the proliferation<br>
of B cells (Fig. 15). For CD86 expression on human B cells PBMC of healthy blood donors<br>
25 were incubated with different ODNs and B cell activation measured as described in<br>
Materials and Methods.<br>
Both results demonstrate that 10103 at least as well as 7909 as a stimulator of human<br>
B cells. Fig. 14 shows that these CpG ODNs were able to stimulate B cells starting at an in<br>
vitro concentration of only 0.4mg/ml. The plateau was reached at about 1.6mg/ml and more<br>
30 than 60% of B cells were found to have up regulated CD86 in contrast to the control that was<br>
much less potent at the same concentration. The results indicate that ODN 10103 stimulates<br>
CD86 expression to a higher level at a lower dose than dose ODN 7909 (e.g., at 0.4 mg/ml) in<br>
all three donors tested, again suggesting that smaller doses of ODN 10103 could be used to<br>
achieve desired levels of immunostimulation. A similar result was obtained for the induction<br>
of B cell proliferation (Fig. 15).<br>
5 Cytokine secretion: ODNs of the B class lead to a Thl dominated immune response in<br>
vivo as well as in vitro. It was found that they are able to induce typical Thl cytokines such<br>
as IFN-? and IFN-a as well as chemokines such as MCP-1 and HMO. In addition, low<br>
secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 as well as TNF-a and secretion of the<br>
negative regulator IL-10 can be observed. We, therefore, measured the secretion of the Thl<br>
10 cytokine IFN-a, the chemokine IP-10 as well as the regulatory cytokine IL-10 and pro-<br>
inflammatory cytokine TNF-a.<br>
Fig. 16 shows the result for an experiment performed with 6 different donors at 0.2,<br>
0.4 and 1.6 /ng/ml to measure in vitro IFN-a secretion. Both CpG ODNs, 7909 as well as<br>
10103, induced significant amounts of IFN-a in different donors. In contrast, the control<br>
15 ODN induced no or low amounts of IFN-a in one donor. The data suggests that a patient<br>
variability may exist with some patients responding better to ODNs such as 10103, as<br>
compared to ODN 7909. This finding indicates that ODN may be classified in terms of the<br>
subjects that are likely to be high responders.<br>
In addition to IFN-a, ODNs 7909 and 10103 induced chemokine IP-10 as shown in<br>
20 Fig. 17. ODN 10103 induced equal or higher levels of IP-10 than did ODN 7909, at all doses<br>
tested. In particular, at the 0.4 mg/ml concentration, ODN 7909 produced higher amounts of<br>
IP-10 than did ODN 7909. At a 1.6 mg/ml concentration, ODN 10103 induced roughly 25%<br>
more IP-10 than did ODN 7909.<br>
As demonstrated in Fig. 18, CpG ODNs 7909 and 10103 demonstrated almost<br>
25 identical IL-10 induction capacity.<br>
As shown in Fig. 19, both ODNs 7909 and 10103 as well as the control ODN showed<br>
a low secretion profile of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-a in all tested concentrations in<br>
comparison to LPS. At the highest dose tested (i.e., 6 mg/ml), ODN 7909 stimulated the<br>
secretion of higher levels of IL-10 than did ODN 7909. The dose responses are shown in Fig.<br>
30 21.<br>
In vitro mouse studies: According to the data, both CpG ODN 7909 and 10103 are equally<br>
potent in inducing mouse B cell proliferation, have essentially equal potency in enhancing<br>
cytokine secretion by mouse splenocytes, and have essentially equal potency in enhancing<br>
5 lytic activity of NK cells in mouse splenocyte cultures (Fig. 22). ODN 10103 appears to<br>
have a higher capacity for stimulating secretion of IL-6 and TNF- , particularly at the lower<br>
doses tested. Similary, the lytic activity profiles of these ODNs differ according to the<br>
concentration.<br>
10 In vivo mouse studies: According to the results of this study use of either CpG ODN 7909<br>
or 10103 significantly enhanced antibody titers against HBsAg compared to antigen alone<br>
(p
responses when control ODN was used in combination with HBsAg (p=0.85). (See Figs<br>
23 and 24.)<br>
15 Furthermore, both CpG ODN 7909 and 10103 were equally potent in enhancing<br>
antibody responses against HBsAg hi that there was no significant difference in anti-HBs<br>
responses in mice immunized with HBsAg + CpG ODN 7909 and HBsAg + CpG ODN<br>
10103 (p=0.13).<br>
In mice IgG isotype distribution is widely used as an indication of the nature of the<br>
20 immune response where a high IgG2a/IgGl ratios are indicative of a Thl biased immune<br>
response (1). In the present study, the use of CpG ODN significantly enhanced IgG2a titers<br>
compared to when antigen was used alone or in combination with control ODN 2137<br>
(p
Ag + 10103 vs. Ag + 2137). However, the level of IgG2a response was similar when either<br>
25 CpG ODN 7909 or 10103 was used in combination with HBsAg (p&gt;0.05). Therefore, both<br>
CpG ODN 7909 and 10103 are equally potent in their ability to induce Thl biased immune<br>
responses as measured by the increased levels of IgG2a over IgGl.<br>
The CTL responses hi animals immunized with HBsAg using ODN 10103 appear to<br>
be greater than those induced CpG ODN 7909, as shown in Fig. 25.<br>
30<br>
Conclusions:<br>
The in vitro data on human PBMC demonstrates that the molecules of the B class<br>
(7909 and 10103) behave similarly but not identically in all of the assays performed. Of<br>
particular importance is the observation that for several of the tested assays and<br>
functionalities, the ODN 10103 induced greater irnmunostimulation than did previously<br>
5 identified ODN 7909. This difference suggests that CpG nucleotides can be tailored for use<br>
in subjects, and also that lower levels of CpG ODNs can achieve desired therapeutic<br>
endpoints, with potentially lower toxicity events.<br>
EXAMPLE 3 (ODN 10104):<br>
10 In vivo effects;<br>
Summary:<br>
Synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) containing unmethylated CpG dinucleotides<br>
have been shown to induce potent innate immune responses against infectious agents and<br>
trigger Thl-like immune activation. The ability of transmucosal delivery of CpG ODN<br>
15 applied to the genital mucosa to protect against or treat intravaginal (IVAG) infection with<br>
herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) was tested.<br>
Materials and Methods:<br>
All ODN were provided by Coley Pharmaceutical Group (Langenfeld, Germany) and<br>
20 had undetectable endotoxin levels (
(BioWhittaker, Venders, Belgium). ODN were suspended in sterile, endotoxin-free Tris-<br>
EDTA (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany), and stored and handled under aseptic conditions to<br>
prevent both microbial and endotoxin contamination. All dilutions were carried out using<br>
pyrogen-free phosphate-buffered saline (Life Technologies, Eggenstein, Germany).<br>
25 CpG ODN and non-CpG ODN were applied into the vagina of female C57B1/6 mice<br>
at various time points prior to or after IVAG HSV-2 infection. Mice were monitored daily<br>
following challenge for genital pathology, survival, and genital viral titer.<br>
Results:<br>
30 Female mice treated with CpG ODN in the genital tract 24 hours prior to IVAG HSV-<br>
2 challenge survived infection, showed minimal vaginal pathology, and had virtually no virus<br>
in vaginal washes for the first 6 days following infection. Importantly, transmucosal delivery<br>
of CpG ODN to the genital tract prior to infection conferred superior protection against local<br>
IVAG challenge compared to intramuscular delivery of CpG ODN. In contrast, mice<br>
pretreated with control ODN alone were not protected, showed severe pathology, and had<br>
high titers of HSV-2 in vaginal washes. Mice treated with CpG ODN shortly after IVAG<br>
5 HSV-2 infection were protected and had low vaginal virus titers, whereas mice treated with<br>
CpG ODN 24 and 72 hours after IVAG HSV-2 infection were not protected. (See Figs. 26<br>
and 27.)<br>
Conclusions:<br>
10 These results indicate that local transmucosal delivery of CpG ODN to the genital tract<br>
prior to or shortly after genital HSV-2 challenge was very effective at preventing infection by<br>
a sexually transmitted virus and suggest that local CpG-induced innate immunity is<br>
involved.<br>
15 In vitro effects:<br>
Materials and Methods:<br>
Peripheral blood buffy coat preparations from healthy human donors were obtained<br>
from the German Red Cross (Rathingen, Germany) and from these, PBMC were purified by<br>
centrifugation over Ficoll-Hypaque (Sigma, Germany). The purified PBMC were either used<br>
20 fresh or were suspended in freezing medium and stored at -70°C. When required, aliquots of<br>
these cells were thawed, washed and resuspended in RPMI 1640 culture medium<br>
supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat inactivated FCS, 1.5mM L-glutamine, lOOU/ml penicillin<br>
and 100u,g/ml streptomycin.<br>
Thawed or fresh PBMC were resuspended at a concentration of 5xl06/ml and added to<br>
25 48 well fiat-bottomed plates (1 ml/well), which had previously received nothing or ODN in a<br>
variety of concentrations. The cells were cultured in a humidified incubator at 37°C. Culture<br>
supernatants were collected after 48 hours. If not used immediately, supernatants were frozen<br>
at -20°C until required. Amounts of cytokines in the supernatants were assessed using<br>
commercially available ELISA Kits (IL-10; Diaclone, USA) or in-house ELISAs (IFN-alpha)<br>
30 developed using commercially available antibodies (from Pharmingen or PBL; Germany or<br>
USA, respectively).<br>
Results:<br>
ODNs of the B class lead to a Thl dominated immune response in vivo as well as in<br>
vitro. It was found that they are capable to induce typical Thl cytokines such as IFN-alpha<br>
and IFN-gamma as well as Thl-related chemokines such as MCP-1 and IP-10. In addition,<br>
5 low secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 as well as TNF-alpha and secretion of<br>
the negative regulator IL-10 can be observed. We, therefore, measured the secretion of the<br>
Thl cytokine IFN-alpha and the regulatory cytokine IL-10. Fig. 28 shows the result for an<br>
experiment performed with 3 different donors at 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5 and 1.0 ug/ml of<br>
10104 or control nucleic acid to measure in vitro IFN-alpha secretion.<br>
; 0 Nucleic acid 10104 induced high levels of IFN-alpha in a dose dependent manner,<br>
with a peak induction at 0.1 mg/ml 10104 nucleic acid. In contrast, control nucleic acid<br>
induced low amounts of IFN-alpha that were comparable to those induced in the presence of<br>
medium alone (Fig. 28).<br>
A similar experiment was performed for IL-10 secretion (Fig. 4). Again, as<br>
15 demonstrated above for IFN-alpha, nucleic acid 10104 induced IL-10 in a dose dependent<br>
manner with a peak induction at 0.2 ug/ml 10104 nucleic acid. Control nucleic acid<br>
demonstrated a similar but lower induction profile, although the peak was shifted to 0.5 ug/ml<br>
control nucleic acid. In this case, control levels were greater than medium levels (Fig. 29).<br>
20 TLR 9 engagement:<br>
Materials and Methods:<br>
Stably transfected HEK293 cells expressing the human TLR9 were described before<br>
[Bauer et al.; PNAS; 2001]. Briefly, HEK293 cells were transfected by electroporation with<br>
vectors expressing the human TLR9 and a 6xNFkB-luciferase reporter plasmid. Stable<br>
25 transfectants (3x104 cells/well) were incubated with ODN for 16h at 37°C in a humidified<br>
incubator. Each data point was done in triplicate. Cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase<br>
gene activity (using the Brightlite kit from Perkin-Elmer, Ueberlingen, Germany). Stimulation<br>
indices were calculated in reference to reporter gene activity of medium without addition of<br>
ODN.<br>
Results:<br>
Recently the receptor for the recognition of CpG sequences was identified and shown<br>
to be a member of the Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) family (Hemmi et al., 2000). This receptor,<br>
5 TLR9, is readily activated by ODNs containing optimal immunostimulatory CpG sequences.<br>
We incubated a cell line stably expressing the human TLR9 with different concentrations of<br>
10104 and control ODNs (Fig. 30).<br>
The results demonstrate that 10104 ODN activated TLR9 in a dose dependent manner<br>
with maximal stimulation at 0.625 ug/ml. The control ODN on the other hand stimulated at<br>
10 only lOjxg/ml and at that was much lower than the stimulation observed with 10104 nucleic<br>
acid.<br>
CpG 10104 effect regardless of delivery vehicle:<br>
Figs. 61A and 61B show the effects of topical CpG delivery using BEMA disks or in<br>
15 saline on local pathology of mice following intravaginal challenge with HSV-2. Female<br>
C57/B16 mice were injected SC with 2 mg of progesterone per mouse (4 days prior to viral<br>
challenge). CpG 10104 (1,10 or 100 mg) in saline or impregnated onto bio-erodible<br>
mucoadhesive disks (BEMA) was instilled into the vaginal cavity (IVAG) 24 hrs before viral<br>
challenge. For viral challenge, mice were swabbed IVAG with a cotton applicator, turned on<br>
20 their backs and infected by IVAG instillation of 10 ml containing 104 PFU HSV-2 (strain<br>
333) during 1 hr while being maintained under halothane anesthesia. Genital pathology was<br>
monitored daily following HSV-2 challenge and scoring performed blinded. Pathology was<br>
scored on a 5-point scale: 0, no apparent infection; 1, slight redness of external vagina; 2,<br>
redness and swelling of external vagina; 3, severe redness and swelling of external vaginal<br>
25 and surrounding tissue; 4, genital ulceration with severe redness, swelling and hair loss of<br>
genital and surrounding tissue; 5, severe genital ulceration extending to surrounding tissue.<br>
Mice were sacrificed upon reaching stage 5. Graph shows mean pathology score relative to<br>
time post infection (days) for CpG on BEMA disks (Figure 61A) or CpG in saline (Figure<br>
61B).<br>
30 The results demonstrate that IVAG delivery to mice of CpG 10104 in saline or on<br>
BEMA disks can reduce vaginal pathology associated with subsequent IVAG HSV-2<br>
infection.<br>
Figs. 62 A and 62B show the effects of topical CpG delivery using BEMA disks on in<br>
saline on survival of mice following intravaginal challenge with HSV-2. Mice were treated<br>
essentially as described above. Mice were monitored daily and were sacrificed when severe<br>
genital ulceration extending to surrounding tissue was noted. Graph shows % survival relative<br>
5 to time post infection (days) for CpG on BEMA disks (Figure 62A) or CpG in saline (Figure<br>
62B).<br>
The results demonstrate that IVAG delivery to mice of CpG 10104 in saline or on<br>
BEMA disks can enhance survival following subsequent IVAG HSV-2 infection.<br>
10 Parental administration of CpG 10104:<br>
Figs. 63 and 64 show the effects of parenteral CpG 10104 delivery on IP-10 and IFN-<br>
gamma levels in plasma of mice. Female BALB/c mice were injected SC with 100 nmoles of<br>
CpG 10104 in saline, CpG 7909 in saline or resiquimod (R-848). At various time-points after<br>
injection (1,2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,10,11,12 hrs) mice were bled, plasma collected and IP-10<br>
15 levels determined by ELISA.<br>
The results indicate that CpG 10104 can induce significant amounts of IP-10 and IFN-<br>
gamma in plasma after SC injection, and that levels attained are greater than those with R-<br>
848.<br>
20 Mucosal administration of CpG 10104:<br>
Fig. 65 shows the effects of intravaginal CpG 10104 delivery on IP-10 levels in<br>
plasma of mice. Female BALB/c mice had 100 nmoles of CpG 10104 in saline, CpG 7909 in<br>
saline or resiquimod (R-848) instilled into the vaginal cavity. At various time-points after<br>
injection (1,2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,10, 11,12 hrs) mice were bled, plasma collected and IP-10<br>
25 levels determined by ELISA. The results indicate that CpG 10104 can induce significant<br>
amounts of IP-10 in plasma after IVAG instillation.<br>
Fig. 69 shows the effects of intravaginal CpG 10104 delivery on IP-10 levels in<br>
vaginal wash of mice. Female BALB/c mice had 100 nmoles of CpG 10104 in saline, CpG<br>
7909 in saline or resiquimod (R-848) instilled into the vaginal cavity. At various time-points<br>
30 after injection (15 min, 30 min, 1,2, 3,4, 5, 6,7, 8, 9,10,11,12 hrs), vaginal cavity of mice<br>
was washed three tunes with 75 ml of PBS. IP-10 levels in vaginal wash were determined by<br>
ELISA. The results indicate that CpG 10104 can induce significant local production of IP-10<br>
in vaginal cavity after IVAG instillation.<br>
Topical administration of CpG 10104:<br>
5 Fig. 67 shows the effects of topical CpG delivery on local pathology of mice following<br>
intravaginal challenge with HSV-2. Female C57/B16 mice were injected SC with 2 ing of<br>
progesterone per mouse (4 days prior to viral challenge). CpG 10104 (1,10 or 100 mg) in<br>
saline, or Resiquimod (1,10 or 100 mg) was instilled into the vaginal cavity (IVAG) 24 hrs<br>
before viral challenge. For viral challenge, mice were swabbed IVAG with a cotton<br>
10 applicator, turned on their backs and infected by IVAG instillation of 10 ml containing 104<br>
PFU HSV-2 (strain 333) during 1 hr while being maintained under halothane anesthesia.<br>
Genital pathology was monitored daily following HSV-2 challenge and scoring performed<br>
blinded. Pathology was scored on a 5-point scale: 0, no apparent infection; 1, slight redness of<br>
external vagina; 2, redness and swelling of external vagina; 3, severe redness and swelling of<br>
15 external vaginal and surrounding tissue; 4, genital ulceration with severe redness, swelling<br>
and hair loss of genital and surrounding tissue; 5, severe genital ulceration extending to<br>
surrounding tissue. Mice were sacrificed upon reaching stage 5.<br>
The graph shows mean pathology score relative to time post infection (days) for CpG<br>
ODN 10104 in saline or Resiquimod. The results demonstrate that IVAG delivery of CpG<br>
20 10104 to mice can reduce vaginal pathology associated with subsequent IVAG HSV-2<br>
infection, and that CpG 10104 can be more efficacious than a ten-fold higher dose of R-848.<br>
Fig. 68 shows the effects of topical CpG delivery on survival of mice following<br>
intravaginal challenge with HSV-2. Mice were treated essentially as described above. Mice<br>
were monitored daily and were sacrificed when severe genital ulceration extending to<br>
25 surrounding tissue was noted. Graph shows % survival relative to time post infection (days)<br>
for CpG ODN 10104 in saline or Resiquimod.<br>
The results demonstrate that IVAG delivery of CpG 10104 to mice can enhance<br>
survival following subsequent IVAG HSV-2 infection, and that CpG 10104 can be more<br>
efficacious than a ten-fold higher dose of R-848.<br>
30 Figs. 70A and 70B show the effects of topical CpG delivery on survival and local<br>
pathology of mice following intravaginal challenge with HSV-2. Mice were treated<br>
essentially as described above. CpG 10104 (100 mg) in saline, or in an oil-in-water cream<br>
was instilled into the vaginal cavity (IVAG) either as a single application 4 hrs after viral<br>
infection, or as a multiple application, once daily for 5 days. Genital pathology was monitored<br>
daily following HSV-2 challenge and scoring performed blinded. Pathology was scored on a<br>
5-point scale: 0, no apparent infection; 1, slight redness of external vagina; 2, redness and<br>
5 swelling of external vagina; 3, severe redness and swelling of external vaginal and<br>
surrounding tissue; 4, genital ulceration with severe redness, swelling and hair loss of genital<br>
and surrounding tissue; 5, severe genital ulceration extending to surrounding tissue. Mice<br>
were sacrificed upon reaching stage 5. The graphs show % survival (Figure 70 A) and local<br>
pathology score (Figure 70B) relative to time post infection (days) for CpG ODN 10104 in<br>
10 saline.<br>
The results demonstrate that IVAG delivery of CpG 10104 in saline or in an oil-in-<br>
water cream can reduce pathology and enhance survival of mice previously infected with a<br>
letha] dose of HSV-2.<br>
15 Immunization of mice:<br>
Figs. 71A and 71B show that CpG 10104 is as good as CpG 7909 in augmenting<br>
humoral responses against HBsAg in BALB/c mice. BALB/c mice were immunized with 1<br>
mg HBsAg alone or with 10 mg ODN and/or alum (25 mg AL3+) by infra muscular injection<br>
into the left tibialis anterior muscle. Animals were boosted at 4 week post primary<br>
20 immunization. Antibody titers were determined at 2 weeks post boost by end point ELISA.<br>
Fig. 71A shows experiments conducted without alum, and Fig. 71B shows experiments<br>
conducted with alum.<br>
Figs. 72A and 72B show that CpG 10104 is as good as CpG 7909 in promoting Thl<br>
biased immune responses (determined by high IgG2a titers compared to IgGl titers) against<br>
25 HbsAg in BALB/c mice. BALB/c mice were immunized with 1 mg HBsAg alone or with 10<br>
mg ODN and/or alum (25 mg AL3+) by intra muscular injection into the left tibialis anterior<br>
muscle. Animals were boosted at 4 week post primary immunization. IgG isotype levels were<br>
determined at 2 wks post boost using end point ELISA.<br>
30 EXAMPLE 4 (ODN 10105):<br>
Summary:<br>
This report summarizes in vitro data with, human cells demonstrating that ODN 10105<br>
behaves as well or better than ODN 7909 in human cell assays. In addition, ODN 10105<br>
behaves as well or better than ODN 7909 in in vitro and in vivo data in mice demonstrating<br>
that CpG ODN 10105 is useful in the activation of the innate immune system, and in<br>
5 augmenting humoral and cellular HBsAg-specific responses in mice when coadministered<br>
with the antigen.<br>
The assays performed were receptor engagement (TLR9), B cell activation (expression<br>
of cell surface activation marker and B cell proliferation) and cytokine secretion (EL-10, IP-10<br>
and IFN-a). All assays demonstrated that ODN 10105 has properties that were similar or<br>
10 superior to ODN 7909. In vitro studies (i.e. B cell proliferation assays, NK lytic activity,<br>
cytokine secretion profiles) were carried out using naive BALB/c mouse splenocytes. In vivo<br>
comparison studies were carried out by comparing the potential of these two ODNs to<br>
enhance antigen specific immune responses to hepatitis B antigen (HBsAg).<br>
15 Materials and Methods:<br>
With respect to human studies, refer to Example 1 for descriptions of<br>
oligodeoxynucleotides, TLR9 assays, human cell purification, cytokine detection, and cultures<br>
for flow cytometric analysis of B cell activation.<br>
With respect to murine in vitro and in vivo studies, refer to Example 1 for<br>
20 descriptions of oligodeoxynucleotides, animals, splenocyte harvest and culture, B cell<br>
proliferation assays, cytokine secretion profiles, NK assays, immunization of mice,<br>
determination of antibody responses, and statistical analysis.<br>
Results:<br>
25 TLR9 engagement: We incubated a cell line stably expressing the human TLR9 with<br>
different concentrations of ODNs 7909 and 10105 as well as a control ODN (Fig. 31). The<br>
results demonstrate that there was no statistically significant difference between the two B<br>
class ODNs in activating TLR9. Both ODNs showed the same dose-response curve and<br>
reached maximum activation at the same concentrations. The control ODN used did not<br>
30 induce TLR9 activation even at the highest concentration of 24mg/ml.<br>
Human B cells: One characteristic of type B ODNs is their ability to very efficiently<br>
activate B cells (Krieg et al., 1995). B cells and plasmacytoid DC are at the moment the<br>
only immune cell types known to express TLR9 (Krug et al., 2001; Bauer et al., 2001).<br>
The direct activation of B cells induced by ODNs 7909 and 10105 was measured by up<br>
5 regulation of the cell surface marker CD86 (Fig. 32), and proliferation of B cells (Fig. 33).<br>
For CD86 expression on human B cells PBMC of healthy blood donors were incubated with<br>
different ODNs and B cell activation measured as described in Materials and Methods.<br>
The results demonstrate that 10105 as well as 7909 are very potent stimulators of<br>
human B cells. Fig. 32 shows that these CpG ODNs were capable to stimulate B cells at an in<br>
J0 vitro concentration of only 0.4mg/ml. The plateau was reached at about 1.6mg/ml and more<br>
than 70% of B cells were found to have up regulated CD86 in contrast to the control that was<br>
much less potent. A similar result was obtained for the induction of B cell proliferation, with<br>
exception that 10105 was able to induce B cell proliferation even at the highest dose test of 6<br>
ug/ml, while 7909 plateaued at the dose of 1.6 to 3.0 ug/ml (Fig. 33).<br>
15<br>
Cytokine secretion: ODNs of the B class induce a Thl dominated immune response in vivo<br>
as well as in vitro. It was found that they are able to induce typical Thl cytokines such as<br>
IFN-y and IFN-a as well as chemokines such as MCP-1 and IP-10. In addition, low<br>
secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 as well as TNF-a and secretion of the<br>
20 negative regulator IL-10 can be observed. The secretion of the Thl cytokine IFN-a, the<br>
chemokine IP-10 as well as the regulatory cytokine IL-10 and the pro-inflammatory<br>
cytokine TNF-a were measured following administration of 10105 and 7909. Fig. 34<br>
shows the result for an experiment performed with 6 different donors at 0.2, 0.4 and 1.6<br>
mg/ml to measure in vitro IFN-a secretion.<br>
25 Both CpG ODNs induced high levels of IFN-a with a maximum reached at 0.4 to<br>
1.6mg/ml. In contrast, the control ODN induced low amounts of IFN-a starting only at<br>
5.0mg/ml. ODN 10105 induced higher levels of IFN-a at both the 1.6 andr5.0 mg/ml doses, as<br>
compared to ODN 7909. The ODNs 7909 and 10105, in contrast to the control ODN, induced<br>
the chemokine IP-10 as shown in Fig. 35, again with ODN 10105 inducing higher levels at<br>
30 the 0.4 mg/ml dose.<br>
The time-dependent effects on different cytokines were also analyzed. Therefore,<br>
PBMC from different donors were incubated for 8h, 24h, 36h and/or 48h and the secretion of<br>
IL-10 or IFN-a was measured. Figs. 36 and 37 demonstrate the results obtained for IFN-a<br>
with two different donors upon incubation for 8h and 24h (Fig. 36) or 36h and 48h (Fig. 37).<br>
5 IFN-a was initially secreted as early as 8h upon incubation with CpG ODN, maximum<br>
amounts were reached at 24h and the amounts stayed at that level or even increased between<br>
24h and 48h. LPS did not induce any IFN-a. For both donors, the ODN 10105 stimulated<br>
higher levels of FN-a at the 8 hour time point at a concentration of 1.6 mg/ml.<br>
A very similar experiment was performed for IL-10 secretion (Figs. 38 and 39). This<br>
10 cytoldne showed similar characteristics to IFN-a although maximum amounts were obtained<br>
at a 48h. Again, as demonstrated above for IFN-a, both CpG ODNs 7909 and 10105<br>
demonstrated almost identical properties in these as in all other assays performed.<br>
In vitro mouse studies: As shown in Fig. 40, ODN 10105 is able to stimulate higher levels<br>
15 of B cell proliferation than ODN 7909 at all concentrations tested. According to the data<br>
shown in Fig. 41, both CpG ODN 7909 and 10105 are able to stimulate IL-10, IL-12, EL-6<br>
and TNF- secretion. For IL-12 and TNF- secretion, ODN 10105 elicits more factor<br>
secretion at all concentrations tested than does 7909.<br>
The CpG ODN have essentially equal potency in enhancing lytic activity of NK cells<br>
20 in mouse splenocyte cultures (Fig. 42).<br>
As shown in Fig. 43, either CpG ODN 7909 or 10105 significantly enhanced antibody<br>
titers against HBsAg compared to antigen alone (pO.OOOl) whereas there was no significant<br>
increase in anti-HBs responses when control ODN was used in combination with HBsAg<br>
(p=0.85).<br>
25 As shown in Fig. 44, the increase in total IgG levels is similar both the CpG ODN. In<br>
mice IgG isotype distribution is widely used as an indication of the nature of the immune<br>
response where high IgG2a/IgGl ratios are indicative of a Thl biased immune response<br>
(Constant and Bottomly, 1997). In the present study, the use of CpG ODN significantly<br>
enhanced IgG2a titers compared to when antigen was used alone or in combination with<br>
30 control ODN 2137 (p
2137 and p
similar when either CpG ODN 7909 or 10105 was used in combination with HBsAg (p&gt;0.05).<br>
Therefore, both CpG ODN 7909 and 10105 are equally potent in their ability to induce Thl<br>
biased immune responses as measured by the increased levels of IgG2a over IgGl.<br>
Conclusions:<br>
5 In vitro data with human cells demonstrating that ODN 10105 behaves similarly and<br>
in some instances, in a manner superior to that of ODN 7909 is demonstrated. According to<br>
the results of the murine studies, CpG ODN 7909 and 10105 have similar immune<br>
potentiating properties, both for their in vitro effects on innate immune responses as well as<br>
their ability to augment antigen specific responses in vivo when administered together with an<br>
10 antigen.<br>
EXAMPLE 5 (ODN 10106):<br>
HCVstudies:<br>
Summary:<br>
15 This study was undertaken to compare CpG ODN 10106 to CpG ODN 7909 for it's<br>
immune activating properties on PBMCs isolated from both normal, healthy, adult subjects<br>
and adult subjects chronically infected with HCV. The ability of the ODNs to stimulate B<br>
cell proliferation, cytokine secretion (IL-10 and IFN-a) and chemolcine secretion (IP-10) was<br>
evaluated. All assays demonstrated that ODN 10106 has properties that are almost identical to<br>
20 or better than ODN 7909 and similar results were observed with PBMCs isolated from<br>
normal, healthy, adult subjects and adult subjects chronically infected with HCV.<br>
Materials and Methods:<br>
Human (HCV) Studies:<br>
25 Oligodeoxynudeotides: CpG ODN 7909,10106 and control ODN 4010 were manufactured<br>
under contract for Coley Pharmaceutical Group. All ODN were resuspended in sterile,<br>
endotoxin free TE at pH 8.0 (OmniPer®; EM Science, Gibbstown, NJ) and stored and<br>
handled under aseptic conditions to prevent both microbial and endotoxin contamination. The<br>
control ODN, 4010, does not contain stimulatory CpG motifs. Dilutions of the ODNs were<br>
30 made in RPMI 1640 complete media (Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY) containing 10% normal<br>
human AB serum (Wisent Inc, St. Bruno, QC) (heat inactivated) and 1%<br>
penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY) just prior to their use.<br>
PBMC isolation: 200 mL of whole blood was collected by venous puncture into heparinised<br>
green top vacutainers from ten (10) normal, healthy, adult subjects and ten (10) adult subjects<br>
chronically infected with HCV who had failed a previous 6-month course of an IFN-a-based<br>
therapy. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were purified by centrifugation over<br>
Ficoll-Pacque at 400 x g for 35 min. Cells were resuspended at a concentration of 10x106/Vml<br>
in RPMI complete media containing 10% normal human AB serum (heat inactivated) and 1%<br>
penicillin/streptomycin.<br>
B cell proliferation assays: ODNs were diluted in RPMI media containing 10% normal<br>
human AB serum (heat inactivated) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin to the following<br>
concentrations 2, 6, and 12 mg/ml. 100 mL of the diluted ODNs were added to the wells of a<br>
96 well round bottom plate. Freshly isolated PBMCs were resuspended to 1x106/Vml in<br>
complete RPMI media containing 10% normal human AB serum (heat inactivated) and 1%<br>
penicillin/streptomycin, the cell suspension was then added to each well (100 mL/well)<br>
resulting in final ODN concentrations of 1, 3 and 6 mg/mL. Cells were cultured for 5 days and<br>
then pulsed with 3H-Thymidine (1 mCi/well) for 16 to 18 hours. Following the incubation,<br>
cells were harvested onto filter paper and the amount of radioactivity measured. Results are<br>
reported as stimulation index (SI) with respect to untreated media control.<br>
Cytokine detection: ODNs were diluted in RPMI media containing 10% normal human AB<br>
serum (heat inactivated) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin to the following concentrations 2, 6,<br>
and 12 mg/ml. 100 mL of the diluted ODNs were added to the wells of a 96 well flat bottom<br>
plate. Freshly isolated PBMCs resuspended at a concentration of 10xl06/ml were added to<br>
each well (100 mL per well) resulting in final ODN concentrations of 1,3 and 6 mg/mL. Cells<br>
were incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 48 hours. Following the incubation, cell<br>
supernatants were collected from each well and frozen at -80°C until assayed.<br>
IFNa and .IL-10and IP-10 levels in supernatants were measured using commercial<br>
J ELISA Kits from R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN (Catalogued 41105, D1000 and DIP100<br>
respectively) according to the manufacturer's instructions.<br>
Statistical analysis: Statistical analysis was performed using InStat (Graph PAD Software,<br>
San Diego). The statistical difference between groups was determined by one-way ANOVA<br>
10 followed by Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons test on raw data or transformed data (logio).<br>
If following transformation of the data, the Bartlett test indicated that the difference among<br>
standard deviations was significant a nonparametric ANOVA (Kurskal-Wallis Test) was used.<br>
Results:<br>
15 B cell proliferation: One characteristic of type B ODNs is their ability to very efficiently<br>
activate B cells (Krieg et al., 1995). The ability of the two B class ODNs, 7909 and 10106, to<br>
stimulate B cell proliferation is shown below in Fig. 45.<br>
When compared to CpG ODN 7909,10106 was equally effective at stimulating B cell<br>
proliferation. Additionally, there was no significant difference in their ability to stimulate<br>
20 PBMCs from either population, normal, healthy subjects or subjects chronically infected with<br>
HCV.<br>
Cytokine/chemokine secretion: ODNs of the B class lead to a Thl dominated immune<br>
response in vivo as well as in vitro. It was found that they are capable of inducing typical Thl<br>
25 cytokines such as IFNa and IFN-a as well as chemokines such as MCP-1 and IP-10. In<br>
addition, low secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 as well as TNF-a and<br>
secretion of the negative regulator IL-10 can be observed. Figs. 46, 47 and 48, illustrate the<br>
ability of the B class ODNs to stimulate secretion of the Thl cytokine IFN-a, the chemokine<br>
IP-10 as well as the regulatory cytokine IL-10.<br>
30 The B class ODNs, 7909 and 10106, induced the secretion of similar concentrations of<br>
IFN-a.<br>
Equivalent concentrations of IP-10 were secreted following stimulation of PBMCs<br>
with either B class ODN, 7909 or 10106. There was no difference observed in the ability of<br>
the ODNs to stimulate IP-10 secretion from PBMCs isolated fiom normal, healthy subjects or<br>
subjects chronically infected with HCV. The maximum concentration of IP-10 was achieved<br>
5 at an ODN concentration of 3 mg/ml for both 7909 and 10106. The same analysis was<br>
performed for IL-10 secretion (Fig. 48).<br>
CpG ODNs 7909 and 10106 were able to induce the secretion of similar<br>
concentrations of IL-10 from PBMCs isolated from both adult populations. Maximum IL-10<br>
induction for both ODNs was observed at 6 mg/mL.<br>
10<br>
Conclusions:<br>
In vitro data with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from two<br>
distinct adult populations, (1) normal healthy subjects and (2) subjects chronically infected<br>
with HCV who failed previous IFN-a therapy, demonstrate that the B class CpG ODNs 7909<br>
75 and 10106 are equally capable of stimulating B cell proliferation and secretion of IFN-a, IL-<br>
10 and IP-10 within the same population, and furthermore that effects were the same for the<br>
two populations<br>
Non-HCV Studies:<br>
20 Summary:<br>
CpG ODN 10106 is a class B nucleic acid. These experiments compare the immune<br>
activating properties of CpG ODN 10106 to CpG ODN 7909. Both in vitro and in vivo<br>
immunological parameters were used for this assessment.<br>
The in vitro data were obtained by comparing ODNs 10106 and 7909 on human<br>
25 PBMC. The assays performed included receptor engagement (TLR9), B cell activation<br>
(expression of cell surface activation marker and B cell proliferation) and cytokine secretion<br>
(IL-10, IP-10, EFN-alpha and TNF-alpha). All assays demonstrated that ODN 10106 has<br>
properties that are almost identical to ODN 7909.<br>
In vitro studies (i.e., B cell proliferation assays, NK lytic activity, cytokine secretion<br>
30 profiles) were also carried out using naive BALB/c mouse splenocytes.<br>
In vivo comparison studies were carried out by examining the potential of these 2 ODNs to<br>
enhance antigen specific immune responses to hepatitis B antigen (HBsAg). For in vivo<br>
comparison studies, both the enhancement of humoral responses (antibody) as well as cell<br>
mediated immune responses (CTL activity) were examined, In addition, nature of the<br>
immune response induced (i.e., Thl vs. Th2) was examined by determining the IgG2a/IgGl<br>
ratio as well as the strength of the CTL response.<br>

Materials and Methods:<br>
With respect to human studies, refer to Example 1 for descriptions of<br>
oligodeoxynucleotides, TLR9 assays, human cell purification, cytokine detection, and cultures<br>
for flow cytometric analysis of B cell activation.<br>
 With respect to murine in vitro and in vivo studies, refer to Example 1 for<br>
descriptions of oligodeoxynucleotides, animals, splenocyte harvest and culture, B cell<br>
proliferation assays, cytokine secretion profiles, NK assays, immunization of mice,<br>
determination of antibody responses, and statistical analysis.<br>
15 Results:<br>
TLR9 engagement: We incubated a cell line stably expressing the human TLR9 with<br>
different concentrations of ODNs 7909 and 10106 as well as a control ODN (Fig. 49). The<br>
results demonstrate that there was no significant difference between the two B class ODNs in<br>
activating TLR9. Both ODNs showed the same dose-response curve. The control ODN used<br>
20 did not induce TLR9 activation even at the highest concentration of 12 mg/ml.<br>
Activation of human B cells: One characteristic of type B ODNs is their ability to very<br>
efficiently activate B cells (Krieg et al., 1995). B cells and plasmacytoid DC are at the<br>
moment the only immune cell types known to express TLR9 (Krug et al., 2001; Bauer et al.,<br>
25 2001). We, therefore, measured the direct activation of B cells induced by ODNs 7909 and<br>
10106 by up regulation of the cell surface marker CD86 (Fig. 50), and proliferation of B cells<br>
(Fig. 51). For CD86 expression on human B cells PBMC of healthy blood donors were<br>
incubated with different ODNs and B cell activation measured as described in Materials and<br>
Methods.<br>
30<br>
Proliferation of B cells: Both results demonstrate that 10106 as well as 7909 are very potent<br>
stimulators of human B cells. Fig. 50 shows that these CpG ODNs were capable to stimulate<br>
B cells very strongly at an in vitro concentration of only 0.4mg/ml. The plateau was reached at<br>
about 1.6mg/ml. A similar result was obtained for the induction of B cell proliferation (Fig.<br>
51) where the stimulation index reached maximum at about 0.8 mg/ml.<br>
5 Cytokine secretion: ODNs of the B class lead to a Thl dominated immune response in vivo<br>
as well as in vitro. It was found that they are capable to induce typical Thl cytokines such as<br>
IFN-y and IFN-a as well as chemokines such as MCP-1 and IP-10. In addition, low secretion<br>
of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 as well as TNF-a and secretion of the negative<br>
regulator IL-10 can be observed. We, therefore, measured the secretion of the Thl cytokine<br>
10 IFN-a, the chemokine IP-10 as well as the regulatory cytokine IL-10 and the pro-<br>
inflammatory cytokine TNF-a.<br>
Fig. 52 shows the result for an experiment performed with 3 different donors at 0.2,<br>
0.4,1.6 and 5mg/ml to measure in vitro IFN-a secretion. Both CpG ODNs, 7909 as well as<br>
10106, induced high levels of IFN-a with a maximum reached at 0.4 (7909) or 1.6|ig/ml<br>
15 (10106). However, maximal elevation of IFN-a secretion was of about a factor of three more<br>
pronounced after 10106 stimulation compared to 7909. In contrast, the control ODN induced<br>
low amounts of IFN-a starting only at 5.0mg/ml.<br>
In addition, ODNs 7909 and 10106, in contrast to the control ODN, induced higher<br>
amounts of the chemokine IP-10 as shown in Fig. 53, the plateau was already reached at about<br>
20 0.2mg/ml in this experiment.<br>
A very similar experiment was performed for IL-10 secretion (Fig. 54). Again, as<br>
demonstrated above for IFN-a, both CpG ODNs 7909 and 10106 demonstrated almost<br>
identical properties in this as in all other assays performed. In comparison, the control ODN<br>
induces IL-10 secretion only at the highest concentration.<br>
25 As shown in Fig. 55, both ODNs 7909 and 10106 as well as the control ODN showed<br>
a low secretion profile of the pro-inflammatory cytoldne TNF-a in all tested concentrations in<br>
comparison to LPS. Again, one can observe comparable characteristics after stimulation with<br>
these two ODNs.<br>
According to the data both CpG ODN 7909 and 10106 have essentially equal potency<br>
30 in enhancing cytokine secretion by mouse splenocytes (Fig. 57).<br>
B cell proliferation: According to the data, CpG ODN 10106 is equally potent if not<br>
superior to CpG ODN 7909 in inducing mouse B cell proliferation at all concentrations<br>
tested (Fig. 56).<br>
5 NK assays: According to the data both CpG ODN 7909 and 10106 have essentially equal<br>
potency in enhancing lytic activity of NK cells in mouse splenocyte cultures (Fig. 58).<br>
Total IgG responses: According to the results of this study use of either CpG ODN 7909 or<br>
10106 significantly enhanced antibody titers against HBsAg compared to antigen alone<br>
10 (p
with Ag + CpG ODN 7909 or Ag + CpG ODN 10106 (p= 0.86). Furthermore, the control ODN<br>
did not significantly increase the anti-HBs responses when used in combination with HBsAg<br>
(p=0.86) (Fig. 59). The increase in total IgG levels is slightly but significantly (p=0.04) greater<br>
when CpG ODN 7909 used compared to when CpG ODN 10106 is used.<br>
15<br>
Nature of the humoral response (IgGl vs. IgG2a ratio): In mice IgG isotype distribution is<br>
widely used as an indication of the nature of the immune response where a high IgG2a/IgGl<br>
ratios are indicative of a Thl biased immune response (Constant and Bottomry, 1997). In the<br>
present study, the use of CpG ODN significantly enhanced IgG2a titers compared to when<br>
20 antigen was used alone or in combination with control ODN 2137 (p
p
10106 vs. Ag + 2137). However, the level of IgG2a response was similar when either CpG<br>
ODN 7909 or 10106 was used in combination with HBsAg (p&gt;0.05). Therefore, both CpG<br>
ODN 7909 and 10106 are equally potent in their ability to induce Thl biased immune<br>
25 responses as measured by the increased levels of IgG2a over IgGl (Fig. 60).<br>
Conclusion:<br>
In vitro data with human peripheral mononuclear cells demonstrate that two molecules<br>
of the B class (7909 and 10106) behave very similarly if not identical hi a variety of assays<br>
30 performed, in some assays, ODN 10106 performed better than ODN 7909.<br>
According to the results of the murine studies, CpG ODN 7909 and 10106 have<br>
similar immune potentiating properties, both for their in vitro effects on innate immune<br>
responses as well as their ability to augment antigen specific responses in vivo when<br>
administered together with an antigen.<br>
