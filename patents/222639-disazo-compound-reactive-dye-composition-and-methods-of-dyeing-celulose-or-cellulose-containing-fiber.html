DESCRIPTION<br>
Disazo compound, reactive dye composition, and method of dyeing cellulose or cellulose-containing fibers<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a disazo compound as a reactive dye and a method of dyeing cellulosic fibers using this compound. Further, the present invention relates to a reactive dye composition and a dyeing method for dyeing cellulose or cellulose-containing fibers using a reactive dye.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Various reactive dyes have been known. They have been widely used for dyeing cellulosic fibers.  The reactive dyes have reactive groups such as monochloro-triazinyl, monofluoro-triazinyl, fluoro-chloro-pyrimidinyl, dichloro-quinoxazinyl, vinylsulfonyl, sulfato-ethylsulfonyl and the like.  For dyeing, the reactive dye is used in the presence of an acid binder such as sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, sodium metasilicate and the like in a dyeing bath having a pH<br>
of 10 or higher and a temperature of 100°C or less. The acid binder is often added stepwise during a dyeing step in order to avoidproblems such as unlevel dyeing, lowering in color yield due to hydrolysis and the like.<br>
On the other hand, cellulose-containing blended fibers, especially blended cotton/polyester fibers are commercially employed in large quantities since they give comfortable clothes .<br>
A disperse dye used for dyeing polyester fibers is generally used in a dye bath having an acid to neutral pH and<br>
a temperature of about 100 to 140°C in order to avoid its decomposition and alteration.  These dyeing conditions of a<br><br>
inspires dye do not agree with those of a reactive dye . Therefore, when blended fibers are dyed, a two bath method wherein respective fibers are independently treated in respective dye bath and an the bath/two step method wherein both fibers are successively created in one dye bath while sliding dying conditions for each fibers.<br>
For purposes of reducing a dyeing time, saving energy, simplifying dyeing operations and the like, a reasonable dyeing method wherein there is no need for controlling a delicate and complicated addition of an agent during a dyeing step has been desired. And, in the dyeing of blended polyester/cotton fibers, an efficient one bath/one step dyeing method wherein both fibers are dyed simultaneously in one dye bath is desired. This one bath/one step dyeing method is sometime referred to as "one bath dyeing method" . A reactive dye used in this method should have a stability without causing a decomposition and a high dyeing property under conditions of dyeing polyester fibers with a disperse dye, that is, in a dye bath having an acidic to neutral pH and a temperature of 100 to 140°C.<br>
Some reactive dyes having the above properties have been proposed. Yellow reactive dyes relating to the present invention can be exemplified in, for example, JP-A-60-086168 (1985), JP-A-01-308460 (1989) and the like.  However, the dyes described in these patents have not always satisfactory properties. For example, the dyes do not show sufficient dyeing<br>
property over a relatively low temperature range around 100°C and therefore a high color yield is not attained. Problems such as color breakup and unlevel dyeing upon dyeing using a mixed dye comprising a reactive dye and other dye are observed so that a formulation compatibility, a reproducibility and the like are not still satisfactory. Thus, the development of a yellow reactive dye which always shows a high dyeing property, has a good reproducibility and excellent fastnesses in various aspects such as a fastness to light, a fastness to chlorinated water,<br><br>
a fastness to washing and the like, and does not invite problems such as thermal discoloration, phototropy and the like is strongly desired.<br>
In addition, in a mixed dye comprising a yellow reactive dye together with a red reactive dye and/or a blue reactive dye, reactive dyes having a reactive groups such as carboxypyridinio-triazinyl group, for example CI. Reactive Yellow 162, 163, 178; C. I. Reactive Red 221; C. I. Reactive Blue 216, 217; and the like have been used.<br>
When a mixed dye comprising the above known reactive dye is used for dyeing, however, many problems such as a poor dyeing reproducibility and an unlevel dyeing property caused by the difference in dyeing property of dyes to be mixed, acolor transfer (migration) during a drying step caused by a poor washing of a non-fixed dye, and the like are found.<br>
Thus, in a mixed dye comprising a yellow reactive dye together with a red reactive dye and/or a blue reactive dye, the development of a reactive dye composition which shows negligible change in hue with the change of dyeing conditions including an inorganic salt concentration, a bath ratio, a pH of a dye bath, a dyeing temperature, a dyeing period and the<br>
like over a wide temperature range from 90 to 140°C, excellent dyeing reproducibility and excellent washing property of a<br>
non-fixed dye and without causing problems such as a color<br>
transfer of a non-fixed dye during a drying step and the like<br>
is desired.  Further, the development of a reactive dye<br>
composition having excellent formulation compatibility brought<br>
about by harmonizing a dyeing property of each dye component<br>
and the development of a method of dyeing cellulose fibers or<br>
cellulose-containing fibers are strongly desired.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
Under the above circumstances, the present inventors zealously researched in order to develop a yellow reactive dye having high dyeing property and excellent dyeing reproducibility in a dye bath having an acidic to neutral pH and a wide temperature range, As a result, they found a disazo compound having desired properties.<br>
Further, they found a reasonable dyeing technique by which cellulose or cellulose-containing fibers can be dyed with good reproducibility and without inviting a trouble caused by a insufficient washing of a non-fixed dye and the like, by using the above disazo compound together with a specific red reactive dye and/or a specific blue reactive dye so that a dyeing property of each dye component can be harmonized.<br>

For example, amixingratioof a yellowreactivedye (A) , aredreactive dye (B) and a blue reactive dye (C) to obtain a brown color tone, a gray color tone and a dark green color tone easily giving rise to problems as to a dyeing reproducibility and the like is preferably selected as follows: (brown color tone)<br>
(A) : (B) : (C) = 40 to 80 : 10 to 40 : 5 to 40 (gray color tone)<br>
(A) : (B) : (C) = 10 to 40 : 10 to 20 : 50 to 80 (dark green color tone)<br>
(A) : (B) : (C) = 30 to 60 : 0 to 10 : 40 to 70<br>
If necessary, the reactive dye composition of the present invention contains known additives such as a concentration controlling agent (anhydrous sodium sulfate and the like), a dispersing agent (Demol N, trade name of Kao Corporation, a Tamol-type dispersing agent; Vanilex RN, trade name of Kao Corporation, a lignin-type dispersing agent, and the like), an anti-reducing agent (Polymin L New, trade name of Nippon Kayaku Co., Ltd., an anti-reduction agent; MS powder, trade name of Meisei Chemical Works, Ltd., an anti-reduction agent, and the like).<br>
The disazo compound of the above formula (1) and the<br><br>
reactive dye composition according to the present invention can be applied for dyeing cellulosic fibers by a method such as a dip dyeing method, a continuous dyeing method by padding according to the conventional method and a printing method. If the dying method of the present invention is a dip dyeing method, a bath ratio is generally 1:5 to 1:50. In the dyeing method of the present invention, the dyeing method per se can be conducted according to a known method.<br>
A fiber material capable of being dyedby the dyeing method of the present invention includes cotton, hemp, rayon, polynosic, cupra, lyocell fibers and the like, their mutual mixtures, their blended fibers with other fibers such as polyester fibers, acetate fibers, polyacrylonitrile fibers, wool, silk, polyamide fibers such as nylon and the like, and cowoven fabrics thereof.<br>
The disazo compound and the reactive dye composition<br>
according to the present invention are very useful since they<br>
have always high dyeing property under the condition of a bath<br>
pH of 5 to 9 and a temperature of generally 90 to 140°C, more<br>
preferably 95 to 135°C and therefore they can dye blended fibers containing cellulosic fibers, especially blended<br>
polyester/cotton fibers in the co-existence of a disperse dye<br>
by a reasonable one bath/one step dyeing method.<br>
For example, the dyeingof blendedpolyester/cotton fibers in a one bath/one step dyeing method is conducted as follows:<br>
The disazo compound or the reactive dye composition of the present invention and a disperse dye(s) are formulated depending on desired hue and concentration. Additionally, a pH controlling agent for keeping a dye bath at a pH of 5 to 9, preferably 6 to 8 [for example, 0.1 to 5 g/L of Kayaku Buffer P-7 (trade name of Nippon Kayaku Co., Ltd.)], an inorganic salt [ for example, 5 to 80 g/L of anhydrous sodium sulfate] and if necessary, a dispersing and leveling agent [for example, 0.1<br><br>
to 5 g/L of KP leveller RP (trade name of Nippon Kayaku Co., Ltd.)] are added to prepare a dye bath with a bath ratio of 1:5 to 1:50. After a fabric to be dyed is introduced in the dye bath, for example, the temperature of the dye bath is increased<br>
to 120 to 140°C over 20 to 40 minutes and the dyeing is conducted at the same temperature for 20 to 60 minutes. After the dyeing step is finished, the resultant dyed fabric is washed with water and/or hot water and then soaped in a soaping bath containing 0 .1 to 5 g/L of a commercially available soaping agent to complete the dyeing.<br>
Further, the disazo compound and the reactive dye composition according to the present invention have excellent property that they show high dyeing property at a relatively<br>
low temperature around 100°C. Therefore, the disazo compound and the reactive dye composition of the present invention can<br>
dye polyacrylonitrile fibers which are generally dyed with a<br>
basic dye at about 100°C in a dye bath having an acidic to neutral pH, or wool, silk andblended fabrics comprising cellulose fibers and polyamide fibers (for example, nylon and the like) which are dyed with an acid dye. The blended fibers can be dyed in one bath dyeing method using the above compound or composition.<br>
For example, the one bath dyeing of blended nylon/cotton fibers is conducted as follows:<br>
The disazo compound or the reactive dye composition of the present invention and an acid dye (s) are formulated depending on desired hue and concentration. Additionally, a pH controlling agent for keeping a dye bath at a pH of 5 to 9, preferably 6 to 8 [for example, 0.1 to 5 g/L of Kayaku Buffer P-7 (trade name of Nippon Kayaku Co. , Ltd. ) ] , an inorganic salt [for example, 5 to 40 g/L of anhydrous sodium sulfate] and if necessary, an anti-contamination agent for nylon [for example, 0.1 to 5 g/L of Sunresist NR-100L (trade name of Nikka Chemical Co., Ltd.) ] are added to prepare a dye bath with a bath ratio<br><br>
of 1:5 to 1:50. After a fabric to be dyed is introduced in the dye bath, for example, a temperature of the dye bath is increased<br>
to 90 to 110°C, preferably 95 to 110°C over 20 to 60 minutes and the dyeing is conducted at the same temperature for 20 to 60 minutes . If necessary, 0 to 40 g/L of anhydrous sodium sulfate is further added during a dyeing step. After the dyeing step is finished, the resultant dyed fabric is washedwith water and/or hot water and then soaped in a soaping bath containing 0.1 to 5 g/L of a commercially available soaping agent to complete the dyeing.<br>
A fiber material capable of being dyed with the disazo compound or the reactive dye composition of the present invention is not limited to the materials mentioned above . A fiber material essentially consisting of cellulosic fibers can be dyed in the same way as that described above.<br>
Upon dyeing, the conventional method comprising treating a fiber material in a dye bath at a temperature of generally<br>
40 to 100°C, adding an acid binder in the dye bath and then dyeing can be employed. Alternatively, the so-called all-in-one dyeing method comprising previously adding to a dye bath an acid binder or a buffer in an amount for keeping the dye bath at a pH of 5 to 9 and then dyeing can be employed.<br>
For example, when cellulosic fibers such as cotton and the like are dyed, a dye bath is first prepared by mixing the disazo compound or the reactive dye composition of the present invention in an amount which is varied depending on desired hue and concentration, a pH controlling agent for keeping the dye bath at a pH of 5 to 9, preferably 6 to 8 [for example, 0.1 to 5 g/1 of Kayaku Buffer P-7 (trade name of Nippon Kayaku Co., Ltd., apH controlling agent) ] and an inorganic acid, [for example, 5 to 100 g/L of anhydrous sodium sulfate] in a bath ratio of 1:5 to 1:50. After a material to be dyed is introduced in the dye bath, for example a temperature of the dye bath is increased<br><br>
to generally 90 to 120°C, suitably 95 to 110°C over 20 to 40 minutes and the dyeing is conducted at the same temperature for 20 to 60 minutes. As the pH controlling agent used in the dyeing of cellulosic fibers, a pH sliding agent by which a pH is varied with time due to the change in temperature and the like during a dyeing step, for example 0.1 to 5 g/L of Kayaslide PH-509 or Kayaslide PH-608 (Kayaslide is a trade name of Nippon Kayaku Co., Ltd., a pH controlling or sliding agent) , can be used. After the dyeing stepis finished, the resultant dyedmaterial is washed with water and/or hot water and then soaped in a soaping bath containing 0 .1 to 5 g/L of a commercially available soaping agent to complete the dyeing.<br>
The disazo compound and the reactive dye composition of the present invention has high dyeing property even at a low<br>
temperature range around 100°C, shows a small change in hue even if dyeing conditions are varied, dyes with excellent dyeing<br>
reproducibility and washes off a non-fixed dye satisfactorily.<br>
Accordingly, they can dye a fiber material without inviting the<br>
problem of a color transfer of a non-fixed dye to the fabric<br>
material during a drying step.  Further, the disazo compound<br>
and the reactive dye composition of the present invention are<br>
very excellent in solid dyeing of blended fibers comprising a<br>
mutual mixture of cellulosic fibers, for example blended<br>
cotton/rayon fibers.<br>
By using the disazo compound and the reactive dye composition of the present invention, problems caused by a delicate and complicated addition of an acid binder during a dyeing step such as a lowering in color yield due to hydrolysis, an unlevel dyeing, a color breakup upon dyeing using a mixed dye and the like can be resolved. Simultaneously, the dyeing can be conducted with improved efficiency and high reproducibility.<br>
Upon dyeing, the disazo compound of the present invention<br><br>
can be used singly or in mixture . If desired, the disazo compound of the present invention can be used in combination with a reactive dye other than the disazo compound of the present invention, a disperse dye and/or an acid dye.<br>
An acid binder and a pH controlling agent (sometimes referred to as "a buffer") usable in the dyeing method of the present invention are not especially limited. Example of an acid binder includes sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium metasilicate, trisodium phosphate, tripotassium phosphate, sodium pyrophosphate, potassium pyrophosphate, sodium trichloroacetate and the like . Example of a pH controlling agent includes commercially available pH controlling agents, acetic acid+ sodiumacetate, monosodiumphosphate + disodiumphosphate, monopotassiumphosphate + disodiumphosphate, maleic acid + borax, boric acid + borax, and the like.  They can be used singly or in a suitable mixture, if necessary.<br>
If necessary during a dyeing step, known dyeing auxiliaries such as a dispersing agent (Demol N, Vanilex RN and KP Leveller RP, trade names of Nippon Kayaku Co., Ltd., a dispersing and leveling agent for disperse dyes) , a leveling agent (Newbon TS, trade name of Nikka Chemical Co., Ltd., a leveling agent for specific anionic nylon; Miguregal AM, trade name of Nikka Chemical Co., Ltd., a leveling agent for disperse dyes) , a carrier agent (Carrier 430, trade name of Nikka Chemical Co., Ltd., a carrier agent, and the like), a metal sequestrant (Kayachelator N-1, trade name of Nippon Kayaku Co., Ltd., a neutral metal sequestrant, and the like), an anti-reduction agent (Polymin L-New, MS powder and the like) and the like can be used.<br>
The disazo compound represented by the above formula (1) and the reactive dye composition of the present invention have always high dyeing property as a reactive dye over a wide temperature range in the presence of a buffering agent capable<br><br>
of keeping a dye bath at a pH of 5 to 9. Therefore, they can dye cellulosic fibers with high color yield and excellent properties including build-up property, levelness and reproducibility. Owing to these properties, the disazo compound and the reactive dye composition of the present inventionare very effective for dyeing blended fibers containing cellulosic fibers, especially blended polyester/cotton fibers in the co-existence of a disperse dye by a reasonable one bath/one step dyeing method. Of course, a material to be dyed is not limited to the above-mentioned materials . The disazo compound and the reactive dye composition of the present invention can also dye cellulosic fibers such as cotton, hemp, rayon, polynosic, cupra, lyocell fibers or the like and their mixture with excellent fastnesses in various aspects such as a fastness to light, a fastness to chlorinated water, a fastness to washing and the like and without inviting any problem such as thermal discoloration, phototrophy and the like.<br>

Next, methods for testing and judging dependency on dyeing conditions, fixing efficiency and washing property will be described below.<br>
Dependency on dyeing conditions [Salt concentration]<br>
The dyeing was conducted in the same way as that described in Example 36 except that 25 parts of anhydrous sodium sulfate was used instead of 50 parts of anhydrous sodium sulfate.<br>
Method of judgment: The difference in hue between the fabric dyed with 50 parts of anhydrous sodium sulfate and the fabric dyed with 25 parts of anhydrous sodium sulfate was judged by the naked eye.<br>
O    small hue difference<br>
A   medium hue difference<br>
X    significant hue difference<br>
[pH]<br>
The dyeing was conducted in the same way as that described in Example 36 except that 1 part of a mixture of boric acid and borax (7:3) was used instead of 1 part of Kayaku Buffer P-7 (a pH controlling agent) . The pH value of the dye bath was 8.3. The pH value of the dye bath remaining after dyeing was 8.0.<br>
Method of judgment: The difference in hue between the fabric dyed in a dye bath of pH 7 and the fabric dyed in a dye bath of pH 8 was judged by the naked eye.<br>
O    small hue difference<br>
A   medium hue difference<br>
X    significant hue difference<br>
[Temperature]<br>
The dyeing was conducted in the same way as that described<br>
in Example 36 except that the dyeing temperature of 95'oC was<br><br>
used instead of the dyeing temperature of 100°C.<br>
Method of judgment; The difference in hue between the fabric<br>
dyed at the temperature of 100°C and the fabric dyed at the<br>
temperature of 95°C was judged by the naked eye.<br>
O    small hue difference<br>
A   medium hue difference<br>
X    significant hue difference<br>
Fixing efficiency<br>
The dyeing was started in the same way as that described in Example 35. After the dyeing was conducted at a temperature<br>
of 100°C for 30 minutes, the thus-dyed fabric was taken out, immediately dehydrated and dried, thereby a non-washed fabric was obtained.<br>
Method of judgment: The difference in hue between the above non-washed fabric and the dyed fabric after washing obtained in Example 36 was judged by the naked eye . The fixing efficiency means a ratio of (a fixed dye)/ the total of (a fixed dye and a non-fixed dye) on a dyed fabric.<br>
O hue difference is small and lowering in concentration is minor; It indicates that fixing efficiency of each of yellow, red and blue reactive dyes is high.<br>
X    blue hue is strong and lowering in concentration is<br>
significant;  It indicates that fixing efficiency of a yellow reactive dye is low. When a fixing efficiency of certain hue component is lower in a mixed dyeing, a reproducibility upon dyeing becomes poor.<br>
Washing property<br>
The dyeing was started in the same way as that described in Example 36. After the dyeing was conducted at a temperature<br>
of 100°C for 30 minutes, the thus-dyed fabric was taken out, washed with water, soaped in 1000 parts of an aqueous solution containing 1 part of a commercially available soaping agent at<br><br>
95°C for 10 minutes and then washed with water, thereby a dyed fabric was obtained. Immediately the dyed fabric under a wet condition was folded in four. A cotton broadcloth (white cloth)<br>
was put on an uppermost of the folded fabric and ironed at 130°C for three minutes so that the fabric and the cloth were subjected to heat treatment under pressure.<br>
Method of judgment: The degree of color transfer of a non-fixed dye to a cotton broadcloth (white cloth) by this heat treatment was judged by the naked eye.<br>
O Color transfer of a non-fixed dye to a white cloth is minor. The color similar to that of the dyed fabric is transferred.<br>
X Color transfer of a non-fixed dye, especially a yellow dye is significant. When a washing property is poor and a color transfer of a non-fixed dye during a drying step of a dyed fabric is significant, levelness or fastnesses become worse.<br>
Dependency on dyeing conditions, fixing efficiency and washing property of Example 36 and Comparative Examples 1 to 3 were compared. Results are shown in Table 5.<br><br>
Only in the case of using the combination of compounds for dyeing as shown in Example 36, each dye component of yellow, red and blue reactive dyes showed the same dyeing property. Even<br><br>
if the dyeing conditions such as salt concentration, pH of a dye bath, dyeing temperature and the like were varied, a change in hue was minor, a fixing efficiency was high and a dyeing reproducibility was also excellent. Further, a color transfer of a non-fixed dye was not observed and a washing property was excellent. In addition, the dyeing rates of dye components agreed well with each other and therefore a very level dyeing was attained.<br>

In this case, a solid dyeing property of cotton and rayon fibers dyed in one bath dyingmethod was very excellent. Thus, the reactive dye composition of the present invention is<br><br>
very effective in solid dyeing of blended cotton/rayon fibers and a cowoven fabric thereof.<br>
Example 56<br>
A dye bath was prepared by adding water to 0.4 part of the compound of the formula (11), 0.1 part of the compound of the formula (7) , 0.07 part of the compound of the formula (9) , 0 . 05 part of the compound of the formula (10), 0 . 22 part of Kayalon Microester Yellow AQ-LE (trade name of Nippon Kayaku Co., Ltd., a disperse dye for polyester fibers), 0.15 part of Kayalon Microester Red AQ-Le (trade name of Nippon Kayaku Co., Ltd., a disperse dye for polyester fibers), 0.05 part of Kayalon Microester Blue AQ-LE (trade name of Nippon Kayaku Co., Ltd., a disperse dye for polyester fibers) , 60 parts of anhydrous sodium sulfate and 1 part of Kayaku Buffer P-7 (a pH controlling agent of Nippon Kayaku Co., Ltd.) such that the total volume was 1000 parts.  The pH value of this dye bath was 7.2.  50 Parts of a fabric comprising blended cotton/polyester fibers were introduced in the dye bath. After the temperature of the dye<br>
bath was increased to 130°C over 40 minutes, the dyeing was conducted at this temperature for 40 minutes. The pH value of<br>
the dye bath remaining after dyeing was 6.9. Then, the fabric<br>
was washed with water and hot water successively, soaped in 1000<br>
parts of an aqueous solution containing 1 part of a commercially<br>
available soaping agent at a temperature of 100°C for 10 minutes, washed with water and dried, thereby a yellowish brown-dyed fabric was obtained.<br>
When the dye composition of Example 56 was used, a washing property during a washing step was excellent. The resultant dyed fabric was levelly dyed irrespective of the nature of fibers , Various fastnesses such as a fastness to light, a fastness to light with perspiration, a fastness to washing and the like were also excellent.<br><br>
Example 57<br>
A dye bath was prepared by adding water to 1 part of the compound of the formula (11) , 0.35 part of the compound of the formula (7), 0.16 part of the compound of the formula (9), 0,11 part of the compound of the formula (10), 0.3 part of Kayanol Yellow NFG (trade name of Nippon Kayaku Co., Ltd., an acid dye for nylon fibers) , 0.16 part of Kayanol Floxine NK (trade name of Nippon Kayaku Co., Ltd., an acid dye for nylon fibers) , 0,09 part of Kayanol Blue N2G (trade name of Nippon Kayaku Co,, Ltd., an aciddye for nylon fibers) , 60parts of anhydrous sodiumsulf ate and 1 part of Kayaku Buffer P-7 (a pH controlling agent of Nippon Kayaku Co., Ltd.) such that the total volume was 1000 parts. The pH value of this dye bath was 7,3. 50 Parts of a fabric comprising blended cotton/nylon fibers was introduced in the dye bath. After the temperature of the dye bath was increased<br>
to 100°C over 40 minutes, the dyeing was conducted at this temperature for 40 minutes. The pH value of the dye bath remaining after dyeing was 7.1. Then, the fabric was washed with water and hot water successively, soaped in 1000 parts of an aqueous solution containing 1 part of a commercially available<br>
soaping agent at a temperature of 80°C for 10 minutes, washed with water and dried, thereby a brown-dyed fabric was obtained.<br>
When the dye composition of Example 57 was used, a washing property during a washing step was excellent. The resultant dyed fabric was levelly dyed irrespective of the nature of fibers . A fastness to light and a fastness to light with perspiration were excellent.<br>
Example 58<br>
The compound of the formula (11) as a yellow reactive dye, the compound of the formula (7) as a red reactive dye and the compounds of formulae (9) and (10) as blue reactive dyes were mixed in a ratio of 50%: 25% : 15%: 10% to obtain a reactive dye composition of the present invention. The dyeing was conducted in the same way as that described in Example 36 using 0.5 part<br><br>
of this reactive dye composition, thereby a brown-dyed fabric was obtained.<br>
When the reactive dye composition of Example 58 was used, the dyeing rates of dye components during a dyeing step agreed well with each other. A fixing efficiency was high and a washing property was also excellent. The resultant dyed fabric was levelly dyed and excellent in fastnesses such as a fastness to light, a fastness to light with perspiration, a fastness to chlorinated water and the like.<br>
Effect of the Invention<br>
When cellulosic fibers are dyed with the disazo compound of the present invention, the dyeing .with a high color yield, excellent fastnesses in various aspects, good thermal discoloring and good phototropy can be conducted with good levelness and reproducibility. Further, cellulosic fibers can be dyed with excellent reproducibilityby an efficient all-in-one method.<br>
A fabric comprising blended polyester/cotton fibers can be dyed in the co-existence of a disperse dye by a reasonable one bath/one step method.<br>
In addition, cellulose or cellulose-containing fibers can be efficiently dyed with excellent washing property, excellent reproducibility, good levelness and high fastnesses, by using the reactive dye composition of the present invention.<br><br><br><br><br>
