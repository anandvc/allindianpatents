Description<br>
The invention describes a power semiconductor module comprising a housing, at least one substrate carrier that is preferably arranged in a recess of the housing and is laterally enclosed by the housing with a power electronic circuit arrangement formed thereon and electrical connection elements proceeding from said circuit arrangement.<br>
By way of example, DE 101 00460 Al discloses a power semiconductor module of the aforementioned type such as has long being known in its basic embodiment. Such power semiconductor modules in accordance with the prior art have a substrate carrier forming the lower termination of the power semiconductor mode. In this case, the housing made of insulating material projects slightly beyond said substrate carrier at its longitudinal sides in order to enclose it. Substrate carriers of this type are often formed as a sheetlike shaped metal body, preferably made of copper. This provides a low thermal resistance with effective heat spreading for the heat transport from the power electronic circuit arrangement to a cooling component.<br>
In accordance with the prior art it is furthermore known that the substrate carrier is adhesively bonded to the housing in order that when the housing is filled with an insulating material that is liquid at that point in time, for example a silicon rubber, said silicon rubber is prevented from flowing out. Furthermore, the housing is connected to the substrate carrier by means of metallic riveted connections. These riveted connections are formed as hollow bodies with a continuous cutout in order likewise to enable the power semiconductor module to be fixed on a cooling component by means of a screw connection. In accordance with the prior art, these riveted connections are formed as brass rivets since the latter, on account of the proportion of lead in the brass, enable a certain deformation and thus make a riveted connection actually possible.<br>
2<br><br>
The circuit arrangement of the power semiconductor module is arranged on the substrate carrier itself in a manner insulated from the latter. Various circuit arrangements comprising power transistors, power diodes and/or power thyristors are known in this case. The circuit arrangement is insulated from the substrate carrier by means of insulating substrates, for example DCB (direct copper bonding) substrates.<br>
Furthermore, connection elements of various configurations for load and auxiliary connections, for example control connections for controlled power semiconductor components, can be assigned to the prior art. Various technologies for connecting these connection elements to the substrate or the power semiconductor components of the circuit arrangement are known in this case. Soldering connections, pressure contact connections and/or pressure sintering connections are particularly preferred in this case.<br>
What is disadvantageous about power semiconductor modules in accordance with the prior art is that the substrate carrier is connected to the housing both by means of an adhesive bonding connection and by means of a riveted connection, which ensures a secure connection but is also complex in terms of production engineering.<br>
Consequently, the invention is based on the object of presenting a power semiconductor module comprising a substrate carrier, wherein the latter is joined together with the housing of the power semiconductor module using connecting means that are accessible to a cost-effective and automatable production method.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by means of an article having the features of Claim 1 and by means of a method in accordance with Claim 8. Preferred embodiments are described in the subclaims.<br>
The starting point of the invention is formed by a power semiconductor module comprising a housing, at least one substrate carrier that is preferably arranged in a<br>
3<br><br>
recess of the housing and is enclosed laterally, preferably on all sides, by the housing. Formed on said substrate carrier is a power electronic circuit arrangement from which proceed electrical connection elements for load and auxiliary connections. The substrate carrier thus forms an outer side facing the cooling component or part of an outer side of the power semiconductor module.<br>
According to the invention, in this case the substrate carrier has at least one continuous cutout reaching from the interior of the power semiconductor module towards the outside. The clear width of said at least one cutout of the substrate carrier is smaller on its inner main surface facing the interior of the power semiconductor module than the clear width on its outer main surface facing the exterior of the power semiconductor module.<br>
Furthermore, the housing has at least one extension which reaches into the assigned cutout of the substrate carrier and the thickness of which increases in the interior of the substrate carrier from the inside towards the outride. As a result of this, said at least one extension forms a respective riveted connection with the substrate carrier.<br>
The method according to the invention of producing such a power semiconductor module has the following essential method steps:<br>
•	forming a housing composed of a plastic material with at least one pin-like extension which is directed in the direction of the exterior of the power semiconductor module. In this case, said at least one extension is preferably arranged in the region of a cutout for a substrate carrier. In this case, the respective extension is formed in such a way that it projects beyond the surface that is to be formed by the outer main surface of the substrate carrier after arrangement of the latter.<br>
•	arranging the at least one substrate carrier preferably in an assigned cutout of the housing. In this case, the at least one extension of the housing reaches<br>
4<br><br>
through the assigned cutout of the substrate carrier and projects beyond the outer main surface of said substrate carrier.<br>
•	deforming the respective end of the at least one extension of the housing in<br>
such a way that its end widens as a result, whereby the respective rivet connection is formed. At the same time the respective extension is thereby arranged within the surface formed by the outer main surface of the substrate carrier. This deforming is preferably effected by means of the action of temperature and/or ultrasound.<br>
It may be preferred in this case for the assigned cutout of the substrate carrier to be closed up sufficiently tightly by this deforming of the at least one extension of the housing, in order to fill the interior space of the power semiconductor module with a potting compound without the latter emerging in the region of the cutout.<br>
It may furthermore be particularly preferred if the substrate carrier is replaced in terms of its functionality by the substrate itself. In this case, the substrate forms the boundary of the power semiconductor module and, for its part, has the necessary cutouts for the riveted connection.<br>
It may be preferred if the housing has an elastic sealing device. The latter is in this case arranged circumferentially preferably around the recess and is directed towards the inner main surface of the substrate carrier.<br>
A connection of the housing to at least one substrate carrier that is simple to produce is achieved by the described embodiment of the power semiconductor module according to the invention. This riveted connection is strong enough also to take up the forces that are exerted on the substrate carrier if at least one of the connection elements is formed as a spring contact device.<br>
5<br><br>
Particularly preferred developments of this semiconductor component are mentioned in the respective description of the exemplary embodiments. The inventive solution is additionally explained in more detail on the basis of the exemplary embodiments and figures 1 to 4.<br>
Figure 1 shows a housing without a substrate carrier of a power semiconductor module according to the invention in a three-dimensional view.<br>
Figure 2 shows a longitudinal section through a housing with an arranged substrate carrier of a power semiconductor module according to the invention in a three-dimensional view.<br>
Figure 3 shows an excerpt from a power semiconductor module according to the invention, wherein housing and substrate carrier are arranged with respect to one another.<br>
Figure 4 shows an excerpt from a power semiconductor module according to the invention, wherein housing and substrate carrier are connected to one another.<br>
Figure 1 shows a housing (10), preferably composed of a plastic that is thermally stable to above 150°C, without a substrate carrier of a power semiconductor module (1) according to the invention in a threedimensional view. In this case, at that side which faces a cooling device (not illustrated), the housing (10) has a recess (12) for receiving a substrate carrier, and also two bushings (16) for screw connections to the cooling compound. In this case, said recess (12) advantageously has a respective web (120) at the two longitudinal sides of the power semiconductor (1), in order to enclose on all sides the substrate carrier that can be arranged.<br>
Further bushings (14) for arranging connection elements, here auxiliary connection elements formed as contact springs (62), are illustrated in the interior of the power semiconductor module (1). Said auxiliary connection elements serve for the external<br>
6<br><br>
connection of a circuit arrangement arranged on a substrate carrier that can be arranged in the recess (12) of the housing (10).<br>
In the region of said recess (12), advantageously in its edge region (122) of the narrow sides, the housing (10) has extensions (20) preferably formed integrally with it. Said extensions (20) are formed here in pinlike fashion and project beyond the housing (10) in the direction of the substrate carrier to be arranged.<br>
The illustration furthermore shows a sealing device (30) composed of an elastic plastic, which was preferably produced jointly with the housing (10) in a two-component injection-moulding method. Said sealing device (30) forms a circumferential sealing lip in the edge region of the recess (12) of the housing (10), which sealing lip preferably encloses the extensions (20) in a suitable manner such that said extensions (20) are situated outside the sealing region of the sealing lip.<br>
Figure 2 shows a longitudinal sectional illustration of the housing 10 in accordance with figure 1 with an arranged substrate carrier (40) of a power semiconductor module (1) according to the invention in a three-dimensional view. In this case, the substrate carrier (40) is configured as a surface-refined copper plate. Said substrate carrier (40) has continuous cutouts (42) in alignment with the extensions (20) of the housing (10). Said cutouts (42) reach from the interior of the power semiconductor module (1) towards the outside, wherein their clear width on the inner main surface (44) facing the interior of the power semiconductor module (1) is smaller than their clear width on the outer main surface (46) facing the exterior of the power semiconductor module (1).<br>
The illustration furthermore shows the power electronic circuit arrangement (50), which is arranged on the substrate carrier (40) in an electrically insulated manner. Load and auxiliary connection elements (60) for the external connection of the power semiconductor module (1) proceed from said circuit arrangement. The illustration likewise shows the two-part embodiment of the housing (10) with a base housing<br>
7<br><br>
(100), which also includes the extension (20) and a cover (102), wherein the two are connected to one another by means of a snap-matching connection (104).<br>
Figure 3 shows a excerpt from a power semiconductor module (1) according to the invention, wherein housing (10) and substrate carrier (20) are arranged with respect to one another. Here the illustration shows the substrate carrier (40) with the circuit arrangement (50) arranged thereon and the housing (10) with an extension (20) prior to the deformation thereof by means of the method according to the invention.<br>
The cutout (42) of the substrate carrier, said cutout being in alignment with the extension (20) of the housing (10), is formed here in the shape of a truncated cone with the base of the truncated cone (420) at the outer main surface (46) of the substrate carrier (40).<br>
For the durable connection of the housing (10) to the substrate carrier (40), the extensions (20) of the housing (10) are deformed by means of application of temperature and/or ultrasound in such a way that, in accordance with Figure 4, they no longer project beyond the outer main surface (46) of the substrate carrier (40). By forming the cutouts (42) of the substrate carrier (40) in a suitable manner, said cutouts can accommodate the volume of the deformed extensions (20) completely in their volume. By virtue of the outwardly increasing diameter of the cutouts (42), which are preferably made round, a rivet-like connection is thus formed between the housing (10) and the substrate carrier (40).<br>
It is advantageous here if the substrate carrier (40) projects slightly beyond the housing (10) at its outer main surface (46) in the direction of a cooling component in order that the substrate carrier (40) can attain a whole-area contact with the cooling component that can be arranged<br>
