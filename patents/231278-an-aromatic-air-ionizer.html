This invention relates to an aromatic air ionizer for purifying air, ionizing it and simultaneously rendering it fragrant.<br>
Known air purifiers work on air ionization by which atmospheric air is negatively ionized and released back to atmosphere. In the process of ionization, the impurities present in the air are usually deposited on surrounding objects, such as, the walls of a room, the furniture and so on, {hereby creating new problems of disposal of dirt which thus accumulates and causes fresh health hazards.<br>
This invention, however, has one of its objects, to propose a device whereby atmospheric air is negatively ionized, but the impurities in air are segregated and disposed inside a chamber without resulting in the drawbacks to which the known devices are prone.<br>
Additionally, another object of this invention is to propose a device which releases negatively ionized aromatised air into the atmosphere. Thus the area wherein the air thus purified is let in not only renders such area fresh and health giving but also provides pleasant smelling surroundings. The liquid furnishing the aroma will be selected to provide the desired fragrance. Such liquid will also have, if required, antibacterial or other properties conducive to the well being of inhabitants.<br>
Various other features of this invention will be apparent from the following further description given hereunder.<br><br>
The aromatic air ionizer, according to this invention, comprises a chamber having an air inlet and an air outlet; a stack of spaced ionizer plates placed one above the other, said plates being alternately charged negatively and positively; an air filter member   surrounding the chamber, said filter member being negatively charged; a container containing an aromatic liquid, said container having an outlet orifice covered by a porous member; a tank containing a cleaning liquid, said tank being disposed below the said stack and covered by a liquid filter member; a tan for directing atmospheric air entering the chamber to pass through the ionizer plates and thence against the porous member, before exiting at the outlet through the said air filter member in the form of negatively ionized aromatised air; a pump for pumping the cleaning liquid over and on to the ionizer plates while charging the said plates in the reverse manner, to clean the said plates, the liquid dripping from the said plates, when passing through the liquid filter member, entering the said tank; a control unit for charging the said plates and for periodically operating the pump.<br>
This invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, the single Figure in which illustrates, by way of example, and not by way of limitation, one of possible embodiments of the air ionizer proposed herein.<br>
A chamber C has an air inlet I and an air outlet O. A stack of even number of spaced ionizer plates P are placed one above the other, said plates being alternately charged negatively and positively. The topmost plate will be negatively charged and the bottom most plate will carry a positive charge.<br><br>
An air filter member AF made of wire mesh surrounds the chamber C. said filter member being negatively charged. A container D containing an aromatic liquid A, has an outlet orifice E covered by a porous member M, such as, sponge or felt.<br>
A tank T containing a cleaning liquid L is disposed below the said stack and covered by a liquid filter member LF. A fan F directs atmospheric air entering the chamber through the air inlet I to pass through the ionizer plates P and thence against the porous member M, before exiting at the outlet O through the said air filter member AF in the form of negatively ionized aromatised air.<br>
A pump J is provided for pumping the cleaning liquid L over and on to the ionizer plates P. At this juncture, the said plates are charged in the reverse manner, that is to say, with the topmost plate positive and the bottom most plate negative. This is done in order to clean the said plates, since reversing the charge will result in the impurities adhering to the plates being dislodged therefrom by the cleaning liquid.<br>
The liquid dripping from the said plates, passes through the liquid filter member LF, and enters the tank T to complete a cycle.<br>
A control unit U charges the said plates and periodically operates the<br>
pump.<br>
After some time, during use, the liquid filter LF is likely to become<br>
clogged with the impurities descending from the plates along with the<br>
cleaning liquid. Consequently, the cleaning liquid may no longer be<br><br><br>
In such a situation, the chamber is provided with a level switch N and when the liquid touches the level switch N, it sends a signal to the control Unit U and the said control Unit immedfiately switches OFF the pump and indicates to the user through an indicator Q visibly or audibly. The User is then enabled to replace the cleaning liquid in the tank as well as the liquid filter member LF.<br>
Also there are two metallic strips placed on the outer surface of the porous member M. If the porous member is in wet condition by the aroma liquid the resistance between these two metal strips will be low. If the porous member is in dry condition, the resistance will be high and the control unit indicates the user through the indicator Q to refill the aroma liquid.<br>
It will be appreciated from the foregoing that this invention is not confined to the embodiment herein described and illustrated but that various other embodiments thereof are possible without departing from the scope and ambit of this invention.<br><br><br>
I Claim:<br>
1.	An aromatic air ionizer comprising a chamber having an air inlet<br>

said container having an outlet orifice covered bv a porous member; a<br>
tank containing a cleaning liquid, said tank being disposed below the<br>
said stack and covered by a liquid filter member: a fan for directing<br>
atmospheric air entering the chamber to pass through the ionizer<br>
plates and thence against the porous member, before exiting at the<br>
outlet through the said air filter member in the form of negatively<br>
ionized aromattsed air; a pump for pumping the cleaning liquid over<br>
and on to the ionizer plates while charging the said plates in the<br>
reverse manner, to clean the said plates, the liquid dripping from the<br>
said plates, when passing through the liquid filter member, entering<br>
the said tank; a control unit for charging the said plates and for<br>
periodically operating the pump.<br>
2.	An aromatic air ionizer as claimed in Claim I wherein the container<br>
of aromatic liquid is provided with a level indicator for visually<br>
indicating the level of said liquid therein.<br>
3.	An aromatic air ionizer as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 wherein<br>
the container of aromatic liquid is provided with a level indicator for<br>
audibly indicating the level of the said liquid therein.<br>
4.	An aromatic air ionizer as claimed in any one of the preceding<br><br>
Claims wherein the chamber is provided with a level indicator for<br>
visually indicating the level of the cleaning liquid dripping from the<br>
said plates and collecting on top of the liquid filter member whenever<br>
the said member is clogged.<br>
5. An aromatic air ionizer as claimed in any one of the preceding<br>
