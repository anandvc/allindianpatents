				<td>This invention relates to an apparatus for diagnosing mastitis<br>
of cows.<br>
Technical Field to Which the Invention pertains<br>
The present invention relates to a method and an apparatus for<br>
diagnosing the mastitis based on visual light rays and/or near infrared rays<br>
from urine, raw milk or mammary gland of cows.<br>
Prior art technique<br>
The number of somatic cells in raw milk is an important factor<br>
for the mastitis diagnosis. Heretofore, a direct microscopy method, a<br>
CMT modified method, and a coal counter have been used for measuring<br>
the number of the somatic cells.<br>
At present, a fluorometrical type somatic cell counter<br>
(Fossomatic) is used to measure the number of the somatic cells in the raw<br>
milk. This apparatus can calculate and display the number of the somatic<br>
cells per 1 ml through mixing a buffer solution and a dying liquid<br>
(ethidium bromide solution) to the raw milk, fluorescently staining cell<br>
nuclei of the somatic cells, scatteredly applying the resulting mixture to a<br>
peripheral portion of a disc continuously rotated with use of a microsyringe,<br>
and automatically measuring the number of the somatic cells with the<br>
fluoroscent microscope.<br>
In Japan, it is prescribed that if the number of the somatic cells<br>
is 300,000 or more per 1 ml in the measurement of the raw milk with the<br>
fluorometrical type somatic cell counter, the cow is judged to suffer the<br>
mastitis, and prohibited from being milked.<br>
Problems to be solved by the Invention<br>
However, the conventional mastitis diagnosis method based on<br>
the measurement of the somatic cells with the fluorometrical type somatic<br>
cell counter has various problems to be solved, in that (1) the raw milk<br>
taken needs to be subjected to preliminary treatment with the addition of<br>
chemicals such as the buffer solution and the dying liquid; (2) the raw milk<br>
sample cannot be measured in a non-destructive manner; (3) the raw<br>
material is Likely to be influenced with another substance; (4) the prices of<br>
the chemicals are high, which is disadvantageous from the standpoint of the<br>
cost performance; and (5) skillful technical (method is required to handle<br>
the apparatus and the sample.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a measuring<br>
method and apparatus and a judgment method therefor, which perform the<br>
diagnosis of the mastitis at a high precision in a short time through the<br>
optical measurement of the visual light rays and/or near infrared spectra<br>
from urine, raw milk or a mammary gland of a cow-<br>
Measures to solve the problems<br>
The present invention relates to the method for diagnosing<br>
mastitis of cows, comprising the steps of irradiating visual light rays and/or<br>
near infrared rays in a wavelength range of 400 to 2500 nm into urine, raw<br>
milk or a mammary gland of a cow, detecting an intensity of transmitted<br>
light rays, reflected light rays or transmitted and reflected light rays from<br>
said urine, raw milk or mammary gland, effecting multivariate analysis by<br>
using a classification model based on probability, separability or similarity,<br>
and diagnosing the presence of the mastitis of the cow. With respect to<br>
the visual light rays and/or the near infrared rays to be used for the<br>
detection, those in a wavelength judged effective for the diagnosis of the<br>
mastitis are selected. The intensity of the light rays, etc. reflected from<br>
the mammary gland means the intensity of the reflected light rays, etc.<br>
from the tissues of the living body including mammal cells. As to the<br>
measurement of the transmitted light rays, the incident light rays are<br>
applied to a right side of the mammary gland through an optical fiber, and<br>
the transmitted light rays (on a side of the detector) are measured through<br>
another optical fiber applied to a left side of the mammary gland, while the<br>
optical fiber is applied to a left side. The light rays in the near infrared<br>
range pass an even thick mammary gland depending upon the wavelength<br>
range.<br>
According to the present invention, the absorbance, which varies<br>
depending upon the number of the somatic cells in urine, raw milk or<br>
mammary gland, can be determined by detecting the intensity of the<br>
transmitted light rays, reflected light rays or transmitted and reflected light<br>
rays from the urine, raw milk or mammary gland of the cow. Thus, the<br>
mastitis of the cow can be diagnosed by performing the multivariate<br>
analysis using the thus obtained classification model based on probability,<br>
separability or similarity, and diagnosing the presence of the mastitis of the<br>
cow. Therefore, it is no need to effect the conventionally troublesome<br>
pretreatments, to use expensive chemicals, etc. and to skillfully handling<br>
samples.<br>
The wavelength of the visual light rays and the near infrared rays<br>
to be used for the diagnosis of the mastitis in the present invention ranges<br>
from 400nm to 2500 nm. If the visual light rays and the infrared rays in a<br>
range of 400nm to 1100 nm are used, a silicon light detector is used.<br>
If the near infrared rays in the wavelength range of 700nm to 2500 nm are<br>
used, a light detector of such as a PbSe, InGaAs or GaAa is used.<br>
Since the visual light rays and the near infrared ray in the range<br>
of 400 nm to 700 nm have noises it is preferable to use the near infrared<br>
rays in the range of 700 to 2500 nm among the above-mentioned wave-length<br>
range of the visual light rays and the near infrared rays. Further,<br>
since the raw milk contains various ingredients such as water, proteins, fat,<br>
carbohydrates, minerals, etc. and light rays are absorbed principally by<br>
water as the main ingredient at various wavelength regions, it may be<br>
feared that such will interrupt the measurement of the near infrared spectra.<br>
However, the water-related influence is smaller in the wavelength region of<br>
700 to 2500 nm as compared with those in the other wavelength region.<br>
In the wavelength region of 1100 to 2500 nm, changes in the absorbance of<br>
the somatic cells in the urine, raw milk or mammary gland appear as first<br>
harmonic tone or combination tone of molecular vibrations. Therefore,<br>
the measurement is preferably made with the near infrared rays in the<br>
wavelength range of 1100 nm to 2500 nm, which enables measurement of<br>
the somatic cells in the urine, raw milk or mammary gland in a short time.<br>
Moreover, since the intensity of the light absorption in the urine,<br>
raw milk or mammary gland is relatively small in the wavelength region of<br>
the infrared rays, the thickness of the sample can be ensured at a few or<br>
several mm in the measurement of the transmitted light rays or the<br>
transmitted and reflected light rays. Therefore, it is easy to handle and set<br>
a sample container.<br>
The mastitis of the cows can be readily diagnosed at high<br>
precision through the optical measurement of the urine, raw milk or<br>
mammary gland and the data processing based on the multivariate analysis<br>
by utilizing a classification model based on probability, separability or<br>
similarity. The method for the diagnosis of the cow mastitis, which uses<br>
the optical measurement values for the urine, raw milk or mammary gland<br>
and the multivariate data processing utilizing the classification model<br>
based on probability, separability or similarity, will be explained later.<br>
The present invention is characterized in that the incident light<br>
rays, transmitted light rays, reflected light rays or transmitted and reflected<br>
light rays from the urine, raw milk or mammary gland in the optical<br>
measurement is scanned over the wavelengths by using a spectroscope, and<br>
the multivariate analysis using the classification model based on the<br>
probability, separability or similarity is applied to the spectra obtained,.<br>
According to the present invention, since substantially continuous<br>
spectra having a high wavelength resolution can be obtained through<br>
scanning over the wavelengths with use of the spectroscope, such a large<br>
amount of data as required for the data analysis can be obtained. For<br>
example, if the scanning is effected in the wavelength region of 1100 to<br>
2500 nm at a wavelength resolution of 2 nm, 701 data can be taken in per<br>
one scanning, resulting in enhanced precision of the data analysis.<br>
The present invention also relates to the apparatus for diagnosingl<br>
mastitis of cows, comprising: (1) a near infrared ray generator for<br>
generating visual light rays and/or near infrared rays in a wavelength range<br>
of 400nm to 2500 nm; (2) an optical system for introducing the visual light<br>
rays and/or near infrared rays into urine, raw milk or a mammary gland of a<br>
cow; (3) a detector for detecting an intensity of transmitted light rays<br>
reflected light rays or transmitted and reflected light rays from said urine,<br>
raw milk or mamma; (4) and a data processor for receiving signals from<br>
said detector, and effecting multivariate analysis by using a classification<br>
model based on probability, separability or similarity to diagnose the<br>
presence of the mastitis of the cow.<br>
The mastitis diagnosis apparatus according to the present<br>
invention preferably further comprises an optical fiber for leading visual<br>
light rays and/or near infrared rays from said urine, raw milk or a<br>
mammary gland of the cow to the light detector, so that the intensity of<br>
transmitted light rays, reflected light rays or transmitted and reflected light<br>
rays from said urine, raw milk or mammary gland is detected with said<br>
detector through the optical fiber.<br>
The utilization of the optical fiber can provide the portable,<br>
compact mastitis diagnosis apparatus.<br>
The cow mastitis-diagnosing apparatus preferably further<br>
comprises a feeder for introducing said raw milk into a raw milk sample<br>
container via an in-line or at line.<br>
The provision of the feeder for introducing said raw milk into<br>
the sample container via an in-line or at line enables the continuous<br>
measurement of the visual light rays and/or near infrared rays with the<br>
lapse of time.<br>
The cow mastitis-diagnosing apparatus further comprises a sample<br>
container for holding the raw milk, and a temperature controller for stabilizing<br>
the milk inside the sample container to a given temperature. When the<br>
mammary gland is to be measured, it is held with a milking machine, and<br>
the temperature is controlled in the same way as mentioned above, if<br>
necessary.<br>
Stabilization of the temperature of the raw milk in the sample<br>
container can prevent variations in absorbance of the raw milk due to<br>
temperature, which can enhance the precision in the diagnosis of the<br>
mastitis.<br>
The spectra for the mammary gland means the spectra of the<br>
light rays from the living tissues including the mammary gland cells. It is<br>
considered that mammary gland cells (including the raw milk) and the<br>
living tissues are milky and cuvette, respectively, in the mammary gland.<br>

Embodiments of working the present invention<br>
The mastitis-diagnosing apparatus according to the present<br>
invention will be explained with reference to Fig. 1.<br>
Fig. 1 is a construction view of a raw milk spectra-measuring<br>
apparatus as one embodiment of the present invention. As viewed in the<br>
light-progressing direction, this apparatus comprises a light source for<br>
generating measuring light rays, a lens 2 for making light rays from the<br>
light source 1 in parallel to one another, a spectroscope 9 for taking out<br>
desired light rays through separating the light rays from the light source 1,<br>
a filter 10 for cutting off a high light portion of the light rays emitted from<br>
the spectroscope, a lens 11 for collecting the separated light rays, a reflection<br>
mirror 12 for reflecting the light rays from the lens 11, a light chopper<br>
14 interposed between the lens 11 and the reflection mirror 12, an<br>
integrating sphere 132 formed of a light-diffusing material, a sample holder<br>
40 for holding a sample, etc.<br>
The light source 1 is constituted by a tungsten halogen lamp or<br>
the like, which generates a wide wavelength range of the light rays<br>
including near infrared rays. The spectroscopy 9 comprises a lens 3 for<br>
collecting the incident light rays, a slit 4 for regulating the size and the<br>
amount of the light ray flux, a reflection mirror 5 for reflecting the light<br>
rays having passed the slit 4, a diffraction grating 6 having a curved<br>
surface, a motor 6a for controlling the diffraction angle of the diffraction<br>
grating 6, a slit 7 for passing only a desired light portion among the light<br>
rays diffracted at the diffraction grating 6, a light-emitting lens 8 for<br>
emitting the diffracted light rays in parallel to one another, etc. Only the<br>
light rays with the desired wavelength can be selectively taken out by the<br>
angular controlling with the motor 6a.<br>
The light chopper 14 is designed in the form of a rotary disc in<br>
which light-reflecting sections and light-permeating sections are<br>
alternatively arranged, and the light rays coming from the lens 11 is<br>
periodically reflected or passed by rotating the optical chopper 14 through<br>
driving a motor 14a. A chopper sensor 14b detects the rotary phase of the<br>
light chopper 14, and a synchronizing circuit 14c outputs synchronizing<br>
signals Sa and Sb indicative of the reflected and passing states for the light<br>
rays from the lens 11, respectively, based on the signals from the chopper<br>
sensor 14b.<br>
The integrating sphere 13 comprises an incident light window<br>
13a opened upwardly, a light-emitting window 13b opened downwardly,<br>
and plural light detectors 20 for converting amounts of received light rays<br>
to electric signals. The integrating sphere 13 functions to diffuse the light<br>
rays entering the sphere to reduce measurement errors. The detector 20 is<br>
constituted by PbS or the like, which has a sensitivity in the near infrared<br>
ray region. The sample holder 40 is arranged near the light-emitting<br>
window 13b.<br>
If the light rays, which are separated by the spectroscope 9, are<br>
reflected with the light chopper 14, the light rays come into the sample<br>
holder 40 as it is through the integrating sphere 13 via the incident light<br>
window 13a. As a result, return light rays diffuse in the integrating<br>
sphere 13, so that a part of the light rays are received with the light<br>
detectors 20. On the other hand, if the light rays separated with the<br>
spectroscope 9 passes the light chopper 14, the light rays are reflected with<br>
the reflection mirror 12, so that the light rays enter obliquely into the<br>
integrating sphere 13 via the incident light window 13a. Consequently,<br>
the light rays are diffused without reaching the sample, and a part of that<br>
light rays are received by the light detector 20. The above operation of<br>
the chopper takes out signals influenced with the sample and those not<br>
influenced with the sample.<br>
Fig. 2 is an example of a block diagram showing an electric<br>
construction of the data processor of the raw milk spectra-measuring<br>
apparatus. Detection signals from light detectors 20 are amplified with an<br>
amplifier 21, and inputted to a sample holding circuit 22 for sampling with<br>
synchronizing signals Sa and a sample holding circuit 23 for sampling with)<br>
synchronizing signals Sb. The sample holding circuit 22 holds a signal<br>
voltage only during a sampling time period when the light rays enter the ;<br>
sample from the spectroscope 9, whereas the sample holding circuit 23<br>
holds the electric signals only during the sampling time period when the<br>
light rays do not enter the sample from the spectroscope 9. Then, output<br>
signals from the sample holding circuits 22 and 23 are logarithmically<br>
converted with logarithmically converting circuits 24, 25, respectively,<br>
which are subjected to subtraction between them in a subtraction circuit 26.<br>
Disturbance components can be removed through detection in synchroniza-<br>
tion with the light chopper 14.<br>
Output signals from the subtraction circuit is quantized with an<br>
AD (analogue/digital) converter 27, which is led into a personal computer<br>
(PC) 30 in which various programs are installed to effect data processing<br>
according to the SIMCA method. To the PC 30 are connected a keyboard<br>
28 for inputting data, a display 29 for displaying the data, etc.<br>
Fig. 3 is a sectional view showing the construction of a sample<br>
holder 40. This sample holder 40 fits to the configuration of the light-<br>
emitting window Z3b) of the integrating sphere 13. The sample holder,<br>
which is made of a heat-conductive material such as aluminum, comprises a<br>
sample container 41 for holding a liquid sample SP such as a raw milk, a<br>
transparent cover glass plate 42 for covering an opening of the sample<br>
container 41, a Peltier element for heating or cooling the sample container<br>
41, a temperature sensor 45 for controlling the temperature of the sample<br>
container 41, a temperature-controlling circuit 44 for stabilizing the<br>
temperature of the sample SP by driving the Peltier element based on<br>
temperature signals from the temperature sensor 45, etc..<br>
When the light rays reflected from the light chopper 14 enter the<br>
sample SP via the cover glass plate 42, they return into the integrating<br>
sphere 13 again after being attenuated and scattered depending upon the<br>
absorption spectra of the sample SP. Consequently, a part of the returned<br>
light rays are received by the light detector 210, where they are converted to<br>
electric signals.<br>
Since the absorbance of the raw milk is sensitive to changes in<br>
temperature and less influence of fat in the raw milk has to be achieved,<br>
significance of the measurement may be lost if the measurement environmental<br>
temperature changes every measurement. Thus, according to this<br>
embodiment, the temperature of the sample SP is stabilized by the<br>
temperature feed-back system constituted by the temperature sensor 45, the<br>
temperature-controlling circuit 44 and the Peltier element 43, thereby<br>
enhancing the measuring precision.<br>
Fig. 4 is a graph showing an example, of near infrared spectra of<br>
the raw milk wherein an ordinate gives absorbances represented by figures<br>
obtained by logarithmically converting reciprocals of light reflectances,<br>
and an abscissa denotes wavelengths (nm). A curve corresponds to an<br>
absorption spectra obtained by scanning over a wavelength of 400 nm to<br>
1100 nm with use of the spectroscopy 9 in Fig. 1. In Fig. 4, results<br>
obtained by measuring plural raw milk samples are displayed in an<br>
overlapped state. Fig. 5 is also a graph showing an example of near<br>
infrared spectra of the raw milk wherein an ordinate gives absorbances<br>
represented by figures obtained by logarithmically converting reciprocals<br>
of light reflectances, and an abscissa denotes wavelengths (nm). A curve<br>
corresponds to an absorption spectra obtained by scanning over a<br>
wavelength of 1100 nm to 2500 nm with use of the spectroscopy 9.<br>
In Fig. 5, results obtained by measuring plural raw milk samples are<br>
displayed, while overlapped.<br>
All the curves are attributable to absorption spectra of water, and<br>
large peaks particularly near 1400 nm to 1500nm and near 1850 nm to<br>
2050 nm are attributable to molecular vibrations of water.<br>
The above explanation is made on the transmission and reflec-<br>
tion type construction where the light rays to be measured pass the sample<br>
SP, reflected at the inner surface of the sample container 41 and pass the<br>
sample SP again. In addition, measurement may be also made by a<br>
transmission type where the sample container 41 is made of a transparent<br>
material, and a transmitted lights having passed the sample SP are detected<br>
or a reflection type where the light rays reflected from the surface of the<br>
sample SP are measured.<br>
The above explanation is made on the construction example<br>
where the spectroscopy 9 is arranged between the light source 1 and the<br>
sample SP and the light rays to enter the sample SP are separated.<br>
In addition, a construction example may be used, where the spectroscope 9<br>
is arranged between the sample SP and the light detector 20, and the<br>
transmitted light rays from the sample SP or the transmitted and reflected<br>
light rays are split.<br>
Next, the SIMCA method (Soft Independent Modeling of Class<br>
Analogy) which is one of the multivariate analyses using classified models<br>
based on probability, separability or similarity. Fig. 6 schematically<br>
shows a method for diagnosing the mastitis with use of a raw milk<br>
according to the SIMCA method. A group of each of known healthy cows<br>
and mastitic cows are subjected to the principal component analysis<br>
(grouping), thereby preparing principal component models for each of the<br>
groups. An unknown sample is compared with these groups, and is<br>
allotted to either one of the principal component models (healthy cow<br>
group or mastitic cow group) which the unknown sample generally fits.<br>
The overall concept of the SIMCA method is shown in Fig. 7.<br>
An optimum SIMCA model is prepared from absorbance detection data of<br>
2/3 of known samples and those detection data of 1/3 of the known samples,<br>
the presence of the mastitis is diagnosed by spectral data of an unknown<br>
sample by subjecting the spectra data to the multivariate analysis.<br>
The SIMCA method is known, and details of it will be omitted. See<br>

Maruzen in 1992, Mutsuo Iwamoto, Sumio Kono and Jun Uozumi.,<br>

in 1994, and Sachihiro Ozaki and Akira Koda, "Near Infrared Analytical<br>
Method" published by Gakkai Publication Center in 1996.<br>
Table 1 gives a graph showing mastitis-discriminated results<br>
obtained by the SIMCA method as one of the multivariate analysis methods<br>
using the classification model based on the probability, separability or<br>
similarity.<br>
The SIMCA method makes judgments in two ways whether given<br>
raw milk is that from a mastitic cow or that of a healthy cow. The hitting<br>
ratio for the mastitis was 99.25% at the time of the preparation of the<br>
model, and that was 95.44% when the unknown data were used. That is,<br>
134 raw milk samples (data for the model preparation and data for the<br>
model inspection) were prepared, a SIMCA model consisting of Class 1 for<br>
spectra data of raw milk samples in which the number of somatic cells was<br>
less than 300,000/ml and Class 2 for spectra data of raw milk samples in<br>
which the number of somatic cells was not less than 300,000/ml was<br>
prepared. At that time, 133 raw milk samples were classified into the<br>
correct classes, and one raw milk sample did not fit the SIMCA model.<br>
Further, unknown 66 raw milk samples were diagnosed according to the<br>
SIMCA model, which revealed that 63 raw milk samples were correctly<br>
diagnosed, and 3 raw milk samples were incorrectly diagnosed. Whether<br>
the diagnosis was correct or not was confirmed by a qualitative analysis or<br>
an expert diagnosis.<br>
Next, cow urine samples were subjected to the principal<br>
component analysis (grouping) in the same way as mentioned above with<br>
respect to respective groups of known healthy cows and mastitic cows,<br>
thereby preparing principal component models for the respective groups.<br>
An unknown urine sample is compared with these groups, and is allotted to<br>
either one of the principal component models (healthy cow group or<br>
mastitic cow group). An optimum SIMCA model is prepared, and whether<br>
the cow from which the urine is sampled is suffering the mastitis or not is<br>
diagnosed by subjecting the spectra data to the multivariate analysis.<br>
Table 2 shows mastitis-discriminated results based on urine<br>
spectra obtained by the SIMCA method as one of the multivariate analysis<br>
methods using the classified models based on the probability, separability<br>
or similarity.<br>
The SIMCA method makes judgments in two ways whether given!<br>
urine is that from a mastitic cow or that of a healthy cow. The hitting<br>
ratio for the mastitis was 96% at the time of the preparation of the model,<br>
and that was 85% when the unknown data were used. That is, 79 urine<br>
samples (data for the model preparation and data for the model inspection)<br>
were prepared, a SIMCA model consisting of Class 1 for spectra data of<br>
urine samples for which the number of somatic cells was less than<br>
300,000/ml and Class 2 for spectra data of urine samples for which the<br>
number of somatic cells was not less than 300,000/ml was prepared.<br>
At that time, 76 urine samples were classified into a correct classes, and 3<br>
urine sample did not fit the SIMCA model. Further, unknown 39 urine |<br>
samples were diagnosed according to the SIMCA model, which revealed<br>
that 33 urine samples were correctly diagnosed, and 3 urine samples were<br>
incorrectly diagnosed. Whether the diagnosis was correct or not was<br>
confirmed by a qualitative analysis or an expert diagnosis.<br>
As mentioned above, according to the present invention, the<br>
mastitis can be diagnosed by detecting the intensity of transmitted light<br>
rays, reflected light rays or transmitted and reflected light rays from urine,<br>
urine or mammary gland, effecting the multivariate analysis of the obtained<br>
absorbance data by using a classification model based on probability,<br>
separability or similarity.<br>
The mastitis can be readily diagnosed at a high precision by the<br>
optical measurement of urine and data processing.<br>
