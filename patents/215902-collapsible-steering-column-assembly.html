				<td>This invention relates to a collapsible steering column having an energy absorbing mechanism.<br>
 Energy absorbing mechanisms for vehicle steering columns are known, for example by an unfolding metal strap arrangement as disclosed in EP-A-0 598 857 or a drawn wire<br>
arrangement such as that disclosed in EP-A-0 705 194. <br><br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a collapsible steering column assembly comprising a steering column, a steering column support and an energy absorbing mechanism, the energy absorbing mechanism including a breakaway means rigidly mounted on the steering column and releasably mounted on the column support, there being an elongate energy absorbing member having one part joined to the column support and extending around part of the breakaway means and ending in a free end located geometrically closer to said one part of said energy absorbing member than said part of the breakaway means, the elongate energy absorbing member being joined to the column support by a rivet or the like and being wound around the rivet so as to form two arms, both arms extending around said part of the breakaway means and both arms ending in free ends which are located geometrically closer to the part of the elongate energy absorbing member which is wound around the rivet or the like; the arrangement being such that, in the event of vehicle crash, the breakaway means breaks away from the column support by movement of the steering column and the energy absorbing member is drawn over said part of the breakaway means, thereby to absorb energy .<br>
Preferably, the elongate energy absorbing member is in the form of a wire. The elongate energy absorbing member can be joined to the column support by a rivet or the like.<br><br>
The energy absorbing member can be wound around the rivet so as to form two arms, both arms extending around said part of the breakaway means and both arms ending in free ends which are located geometrically closer to the part of the energy absorbing member which is wound around the rivet or the like.<br>
The steering column support can be a support bracket which is, in use, rigidly mounted to another part of the vehicle.<br>
The breakaway means can be in the form of a capsule rigidly mounted on the outside of the steering column by means of rivets and releasably mounted on the column support by plastics injection points.<br>
Where the energy absorbing member extends around part of the breakaway means, and then back towards said one part of the energy absorbing member, it can lie between the breakaway means and the outside of the steering column.<br>
Two breakaway means can be provided, preferably on opposite sides of the steering column, each breakaway means having its own elongate energy absorbing member.<br>
For a better understanding of the invention and to show how the same may be carried into effect, reference will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawing, in which:-<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention relates to a   collapsible<br>
steering column apparatus comprising a steering column, a steering<br>
column support and an energy absorbing mechanism, the energy absorbing mechanism including a breakaway means rigidly mounted on the steering column and releasably mounted on the column support, there being an elongate energy absorbing member having one part joined to the column support and extending around part of the breakaway means and ending in a free end located geometrically closer to said one part of said energy absorbing member than said part of the breakaway means, the elongate energy absorbing member being joined to the column support by a rivet or the like and being wound around the rivet so as to form two arms, both arms extending around said part of the breakaway means and both arms ending in free ends which are located geometrically closer to the part of the elongate energy absorbing member which is wound around the rivet or the like; the arrangement being such that, in the event of vehicle crash, the breakaway means breaks away from the column support by movement of the steering column and the energy absorbing member is drawn over said part of the breakaway means, thereby to absorb energy.<br><br>
Figure 1 is a plan view, partly in section (taken on the line I in Figures 2 and 3) of a collapsible steering column assembly having an energy absorbing mechanism,<br>
Figure 2 is a side view of the assembly and mechanism shown in Figure 1, and<br>
Figure 3 is an end view of the assembly and mechanism.<br>
Referring to the drawing, the collapsible steering column assembly includes a steering column tube 1 with energy absorbing mechanisms comprising two diecast breakaway capsules 2, one on either side of the steering column tube 1. Each capsule is secured to the tube 1 by two rivets 3. More rivets 3 could be provided if required. A steering column support in the form of a mounting bracket 4 is rigidly mounted to another part of the vehicle (not shown). Each capsule 2 is mounted in breakaway fashion to the column support bracket 4 by means of plastics injection points 5, of which four are shown in Figure 2.<br>
Each energy absorbing mechanism has an elongate energy absorbing member in the form of a preformed wire 6 which, in the form illustrated, is wound substantially midway along its length around the shaft of a rivet 7, by which means it is securely joined to the mounting bracket 4. The wire 6 extends along the outer surface of its capsule 2 and around an end part of the capsule 2 remote from the rivet 7, this end part being in the form of a pin 8. The two arms of the wire 6 then run back on themselves between the capsule 2 and the outer side of the column tube 1, to terminate in free ends 6A lying closely adjacent the rivet 7.<br>
The wire 6 has a malleability sufficient to absorb energy so that, in the event of a vehicle crash, energy imparted to the steering column 1 via the steering wheel causes the tube 1 and capsule 2 to move to cause the wire 6 to be drawn around the pin 8, thereby to absorb energy. This is of course achieved by the capsule 2 breaking away from the bracket 4 at the plastics injection points 5, whilst the wire remains joined to the bracket 4 and the bracket 4 remains attached to another part of the vehicle.<br>
This arrangement provides a useful compactness and also allows the advantages of the mounting bracket 4 to remain stationary.<br>
The wire could be a single wire or double wire or otherwise and the diameters of the wire 6 and pin 8 can be adjusted to "tune" the energy absorbing characteristics.<br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1.       A   collapsible   steering   column  apparatus   comprising   a   steering<br>
column, a steering column support and an energy absorbing mechanism,<br><br>

support  (4) there being an elongate energy absorbing member having one<br>
part joined to the column support and extending around part of the<br>
breakaway means and ending in a free end located geometrically closer to said one part of said energy absorbing member than said part of the<br>
breakaway means, the elongate energy absorbing member being joined to<br>
the column support by a rivet (7) and being wound around the<br>
  rivet (7) to form two arms, both arms extending around said part of the<br><br>
breakaway means and both arms ending in free ends which are located<br>
geometrically closer to the part of the elongate energy absorbing member<br>
which is wound around the rivet (7); the arrangement being such<br>
that, in the event of vehicle crash, the breakaway means (2) breaks away<br>
from the column support by movement of the steering column and the<br>
energy absorbing member is drawn over said part of the breakaway means, thereby to absorb energy.<br>
