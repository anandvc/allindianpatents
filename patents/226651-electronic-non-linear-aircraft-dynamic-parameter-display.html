ELECTRONIC NON-LINEAR AIRCRAFT DYNAMIC PARAMETER<br>
DISPLAY<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to the field of aircraft instruments. More precisely, this invention relates to aircraft dynamic parameter displays.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Measurement and displaying of dynamic parameters of an aircraft is a key issue for properly controlling, managing and validating aircraft position and velocity.<br>
It is known that measurement of aircraft altitude and vertical speed, by barometric and other means, is a mature technology which is founded on principles which have remained relatively unchanged since the first deployment of altimeters and vertical speed indicators (VSI).<br>
In contrast, the "modern" altimeter display has evolved through four distinct iterations.<br>
An earliest modern variant, the "three-pointer" consists of a circular analog display housing three concentric pointers 'read against a common scale. A pointer is dedicated for displaying each of the 100's, 1,000s and 10,000s feet as shown in Fig. la. This format is difficult to interpret,, particularly during dynamic situations. Use of this technology resulted in several aircraft accidents because the small 10,000 ft pointer is easily obscured by larger pointers, leading to interpretation errors of multiples of 10,000 ft. This tendency became unacceptable with the advent of jet aircraft, whose high rates of climb and descent rendered the three-pointer altimeter virtually useless.<br><br>
virtually useless. ■ It will be appreciated by someone skilled in the art that the three-pointer altimeter is still in widespread use in low-performance general aviation aircraft.<br>
A second generation of mechanical altimeters, the "counter-pointer" altimeter, is a refinement of the "three-pointer" altimeter which comprises a single 100 ft pointer, sweeping over a circular scale, with an additional digital display of altitude presented on a drum or counter on the face of the instrument as shown in Fig. lb.<br>
Although the details of the digital display, such as its smallest digital altitude increment, vary between different embodiments, the principle remains unaltered. The main benefits of the "counter-pointer" altimeter include its ease of interpretation and elimination of the 10,000 ft interpretation error potential.<br>
A third generation of altimeters comprises a moving vertical altitude tape read against a central stationary pointer, as shown in Fig. 2. The instrument typically includes a digital readout of the aircraft altitude adjacent to the tape display. Refinements to this system include provision of a vertical speed display adjacent to the altitude scale, and which allows the pilot to monitor altitude and vertical speed simultaneously, with a minimum of eye movement.<br>
A current generation of altimeters reflects a transition from mechanical instruments to Electronic Flight Instrument Systems (EFIS) and Head-up Displays (HUD). Such systems have allowed the altitude display indications to be decoupled from any "physical" altimeter instrument, thereby allowing incorporation of new display formats.<br><br>
Modern altimeter formats described above have several important disadvantages.<br>
Except at very low altitudes, there is no analog representation of the aircraft's altitude above the altitude reference datum which is typically mean sea-level (MSL). This is because at high altitudes, neither the counter pointer nor the tape altimeter can show the zero-altitude datum, because of the scaling compromise between adequate resolution and adequate range. In other words, the analog part of these altimeters can only display a relatively narrow altitude band around the aircraft's current altitude, which typically does not include the zero point. This is an important drawback, because it has been contemplated that humans are much better at evaluating rates of change of analog data (e.g. pointers) than digital data, and the simultaneous display of the zero datum and the reference datum is critical, particularly in very dynamic situations. Traditional implementations have been unable to display the altitude information in the preferred analog fashion, while simultaneously ^displaying both the zero datum and current altitude.<br>
Furthermore, the resolution of the mechanical altimeters is generally fixed at' all altitudes, even though flight operations may require differing resolutions for different circumstances (e.g. higher resolution is desirable at low altitudes, where terrain clearance is most critical).<br>
With respect to aircraft airspeed, it is known that measurement of the aircraft airspeed, by pitot-static means, sis also known as a very mature technology which is founded on principles which have remained largely unchanged since the deployment of the first airspeed indicators (ASI). Modern airspeed indicators takes one of two forms: a dial/pointer<br><br>
display, occasionally supplemented with a digital counter and the fixed pointer/moving tape display typically incorporated in Electronic Flight Instrument Systems (EFIS) and Head-Up Display (HUD), as shown in Fig. 3. Both of these formats share an important disadvantage, they use a fixed scale which requires a tradeoff between resolution, and scale range. In . other words, a large scale is more legible, but•■ has a relatively small display range, whereas a smaller scale achieves good range while compromising legibility.<br>
There is therefore a need for a method and apparatus that will overcome the above-identified drawbacks.<br>

It will be appreciated by someone skilled in the art that this first principle enables a proper presentation of altitude information to the pilot of the aircraft.<br>
A second principle is the fact that, preferably, the first altitude value. 140 represents the altimeter setting datum. The altimeter setting datum may be the mean sea level in one embodiment. In another embodiment, the altimeter setting datum may be a standard pressure datum {29.92 inch of mercury) . In another embodiment, the altimeter datum may be the surface itself in the case where the altitude measuring device 118 is a radar altimeter or radio altimetry device.- The altimeter setting datum may be manually set or obtained from the air data computer or radar altimeter.<br>
A third principle relates to the fact that the dynamic nonlinear altitude scale 134 is scaled using the selected display<br><br>
algorithm signal in order to fit both the measured altitude signal and the altimeter setting datum 140 in the available display space.<br>
In one embodiment, the selected display algorithm signal is an exponential factor. In another embodiment of the invention, the selected display algorithm signal is a logarithmic factor. In another alternative embodiment, the selected display algorithm signal is a geometric factor. In a preferred embodiment, the selected display algorithm signal is set so that the scale of the dynamic non-linear altitude scale 134 decreases as it diverges from a current altitude; i.e., the highest resolution in the dynamic non-linear altitude scale 134 is observed immediately adjacent to the measured altitude signal of the aircraft.<br>
The choice of a geometric factor, a logarithmic factor, an exponential factor or any other non-linear selected display algorithm signal may depend on a desired application and a desired altitude display range.<br>
A fourth principles relates to the fact that above the measured altitude signal, the dynamic non-linear altitude scale 134 is scaled by a similar geometric factor., logarithmic factor, exponential factor or any other non-linear selected display algorithm signal to the second altitude value 142. Because of the relative greater significance of altitudes below the aircraft, it is possible to adapt an upper scaling factor to show a smaller altitude scale above the measured altitude signal than below the measured altitude signal. It will be appreciated that as per the third principle, the selected display algorithm signal may also be changed automatically.<br><br>
Someone skilled in the art will appreciate that the high<br>
resolution is located where it is most important to maintain<br>
* an accurate altitude in order to comply, for instance, with<br>
air traffic controller (ATC) clearances; and simultaneously, a<br>
clear graphic indication of the aircraft's relationship to the<br>
first altitude value 140 is given.<br>
As mentioned previously, it will be appreciated that while a first part of the dynamic non-linear altitude scale 134, for instance, the part above the pointer 144, is adapted according to a first selected display algorithm signal, a second part of the dynamic non-linear altitude scale 134, for instance, the part below the pointer 144 may be adapted according to a second selected display algorithm' signal.<br>
Now referring to Fig. 12, there is shown a second example of the altitude tape 130 provided on an electronic non-linear aircraft altitude display.<br>
In this example, the pointer 144 displays a measured altitude signal of 5000ft.<br>
Still in this example, the indication of an altitude variation with respect to a predetermined amount of time 150 is -3000ft/min and the corresponding future altitude value 152 will be 2000ft if the aircraft maintains its rate of descent.<br>
It will further be appreciated that the dynamic non-linear altitude scale 134 is constantly adapted according to the display algorithm signal in order to emphasize a range of altitude; such constant adaptation enables the pilot of the aircraft to have a good appreciation of the dynamics of the aircraft; more precisely, the skilled addressee will appreciate that in the case of a descent, the dynamic non-<br><br>
linear speed scale 134 increases as there is less altitude in order to "fit" into the available display area. This results in increasing resolution where it is most necessary which is at low altitudes.<br>
As a corollary, for a given rate of climb or descent, the dynamic non-linear speed scale 134 will move more rapidly at low altitudes than at high altitudes, because the scale factor is greater in the former case. This has a beneficial effect of highlighting high descent rates at low altitudes by giving them greater saliency.<br>
While it may be argued that the adjacent vertical bar is analogous to existing vertical speed indicator (VSI), it will be appreciated that prior art vertical speed indicators are incapable of showing very high rates of change while maintaining adequate resolution for normal operations. Accordingly, it is not unusual for contemporary vertical speed indicators to be "pegged" particularly during high-speed descents, so the pilot has little idea of the actual descent rate and its relationship with current altitude, particularly for high performance aircraft. This is unfortunately also the case with prior art vertical speed indicator displays which incorporate 'dfgital readouts, because the determination of "time-to-impact" still requires a mental division of the measured altitude signal (which is changing very rapidly) by the instantaneous vertical speed indicator reading.<br>
The mental division is usually an impossible task under dynamic conditions with a high workload.<br>
The skilled addressee will appreciate■that such shortcoming is not possible with the present invention since the only time<br><br>
when vertical speed indicator will be "pegged" will be when ground impact is in less than 1 min.<br>
In such case, the imminent impact will be obvious, and the digital readout 150 will still provide the required rate information to the pilot.<br>
It will further be appreciated that a further benefit of such embodiment of the altitude tape 130 is that the pilot may easily achieve the ideal asymptotic level-off at a desired altitude simply by adjusting the rate of climb or descent to anchor the variable end 58 to the desired level-off altitude. Used in this manner, the constant adaptation of the dynamic non-linear altitude scale 134 has the effect of gradually reducing the rate of climb or descent to zero as the difference between the required and current measured altitude signal diminishes.<br>
Now referring to Fig. 13, there is shown a block diagram which shows- a second embodiment of the invention where the electronic non-linear aircraft dynamic parameter display is an electronic non-linear aircraft speed display 162.<br>
The electronic non-linear aircraft speed display 162 comprises a processing unit 164 and a display unit 166.<br>
Still in this first embodiment of the invention, the processing unit 164 is an air data computer, which is well known to one versed in the art, while the display unit 166 is an airspeed display on an electronic Flight Instrumentation System (EFIS), a multifunction Display (MFD), or a Head-Up Display (HUD) , all of which are well known to one versed in the art.<br><br>
The processing unit 164 receives a selected display algorithm signal provided by the user interface 160 and a measured speed signal provided by the speed measuring device 168.<br>
The processing unit 164 provides a speed 'display signal to the display unit 166.<br>
Now referring to Fig. 14, there is shown how the electronic non-linear aircraft speed display 162 operates in the preferred embodiment of the invention.<br>
According to step 180, a display algorithm is selected using the user interface 160. The selected display algorithm signal is provided by the user interface 160 to the processing unit 164. In one embodiment, the display algorithm is selected by the pilot of the aircraft while in another embodiment of the invention, the display algorithm is selected by the air data computer or the like.<br>
According to step 182, a speed signal is measured using the speed measuring device 168 which provides the measured speed signal to the processing unit 164.<br>
According to step 184, a speed display signal, comprising a speed tape is provided on the display unit 166. The speed tape is provided by first determining the speed display signal using the measured speed signal and the selected display algorithm signal and providing the created speed display signal to the display unit 166.<br>
Now referring to Fig. 15, there is shown an example of a speed tape 190 provided on an electronic non-linear aircraft dynamic parameter display.<br><br>
The speed tape 190 'comprises a dynamic non-linear speed scale 192,  a corresponding non-linear speed value scale 194,  a pointer 212 and an adjacent vertical bar 214.<br>
Preferably, the dynamic non-linear speed scale 192 and the corresponding non-linear speed value scale 194 are displayed vertically.<br>
The dynamic non-linear speed scale 192 comprises a speed scale that is provided between a first speed scale end 196 and a second speed scale end 198.<br>
The corresponding non-linear speed value scale 194 comprises a plurality of corresponding speed values and is provided between a first speed value 2 00 corresponding to the first speed scale end 196 and a second speed value 210 corresponding to the second speed scale end 210.<br>
The pointer 212 is located substantially in the middle of the dynamic non-linear speed scale 192. The pointer 212 comprises an indication of the measured speed signal.<br>
The adjacent vertical bar 214 is	located adjacent to the<br>
corresponding non-linear speed value	scale 194. Alternatively,<br>
the adjacent vertical bar* 214 is	located adjacent to the<br>
dynamic non-linear speed scale 192.<br>
The adjacent vertical bar 214 comprises a variable end 216 which is adjacent to a corresponding future speed value 218. The adjacent vertical bar 214 therefore provides an indication of a future speed value if a current variation of the speed is maintained during a predetermined amount of time. In a preferred embodiment, the predetermined amount of time is 10 sec.<br><br>
The skilled addressee will appreciate" that the corresponding future speed value 218 can easily be seen by fcthe pilot of the aircraft looking at the variable end 216.<br>
It will be appreciated that the dynamic non-linear speed scale 192 is constantly adapted according to the selected display algorithm signal. In one embodiment, the selected display algorithm signal is an exponential factor, in another embodiment of the invention, the selected display algorithm signal is a logarithmic factor; in another alternative embodiment, the selected display algorithm signal is a geometric factor.<br>
In fact, the selected algorithm is set so that the highest resolution is observed immediately adjacent to the measured speed signal.<br>
Furthermore, it will be appreciated that while a first part of the dynamic non-linear speed scale 192 is adapted according to a first selected display algorithm signal, a second part of the dynamic non-linear speed scale 192 may be adapted according to a second selected display algorithm signal.<br>
In one embodiment, the first speed value 200 corresponding to the first speed scale end 196 and the second speed value 210 corresponding to the second speed scale end 198 are provided by the user interface 160 while in the preferred embodiment, the first speed value 200 and the second speed value 210 are automatically selected by the air data computer. It will be appreciated that the first speed value 200 and the second speed value 210 may be selected according to the design of the aircraft.<br>
In this example, the measured speed signal is 205kts.<br><br>
It will be appreciated that alternatively, the speed tape 190 comprises an indication of characteristic speeds of the aircraft such as Vfe, VNe, Vg, VI, Vr, etc.<br>
Furthermore speed zones, such as the "yellow arc", the "green arc" and the "white arc" may be added on the speed tape 190. The skilled addressee will appreciate that the "white arc" 191 is shown on the speed tape 190 disclosed in Fig. 15.<br>
It will be appreciated by the one skilled in the art that the embodiment enables the scale of the dynamic non-linear speed scale 192 to be maximum in the vicinity of the measured speed signal.<br>
Furthermore, the corresponding first speed value 200 and the corresponding second speed value 210 are always displayed on the speed tape 190.<br>
Moreover, as the aircraft approaches low or high airspeed, where most limitations are encountered, the dynamic non-linear speed scale 192 ensures good legibility in these critical regimes.<br>
As per the embodiment where the dynamic parameter is altitude, it will be appreciated that the adjacent vertical bar 214 is of great advantage to show very high rate of change without exceeding available display.<br>
While prior art trend vectors may be "pegged", the embodiment disclosed therein overcome such shortcoming which is of great advantage in the case of military jets.<br>
While it has been disclosed the dynamic parameter may be one of speed and altitude, the skilled addressee will appreciate that  the  dynamic parameter may alternatively be  one  of<br><br>
rotations per minutes (RPM) , oil pressure, oil temperature, fuel flow, tachometer, remaining fuel or the like.<br>
