In a further aspect the present invention provides a method of treatment of diseases mediated by microbes which comprises administering to a subject in need of such treatment an effective amount of a compound of the present invention e.g. in the form of a pharmaceutical composition.<br>
In a further aspect the present invention provides a method of treatment of acne which comprises administering to a subject in need of such treatment an effective amount of a compound of the present invention e.g. in the form of a pharmaceutical composition.<br>
Treatment includes treatment and prophylaxis.<br>
For antimicrobial and acne treatment, the appropriate dosage will, of course, vary depending upon, for example, the chemical nature and the pharmakokinetic data of a compound of the present invention employed, the individual host, the mode of administration and the nature and severity of the conditions being treated. However, in general, for satisfactory results in larger mammals, for example humans, an indicated daily dosage is in the range from about 0.01 to 3 g of a compound of the present invention conveniently administered, for example, in divided doses up to four times a day.<br>
A compound of the present invention may be administered by any conventional route, for example enterally, e.g. including nasal, buccal, rectal, oral, administration; parenterally, e.g. including intravenous, intramuscular, subcutanous administration; or topically, e.g. including epicutaneous, intranasal, intratracheal administration, e.g. in form of coated or uncoated tablets, capsules, injectable solutions or suspensions, e.g. in the form of ampoules, vials, in the form of semi-solid formulations, e.g. ointments, creams, gels, pastes, in the form of inhaler powder, foams, tinctures, lip sticks, concealer sticks, drops, sprays, or in the form of suppositories, e.g. in analogous manner to macrolides, such as erythromycins, e.g. clarithromycin or azithromycin.<br>
A compound of the present invention may be administered in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, e.g. an acid addition salt or metal salt; or in free form; optionally in the form of a solvate. A compound of the present invention in the form of a salt exhibit the same order of activity as the compound in free form; optionally in the form of a solvate.<br>
A compound of the present invention may be used for pharmaceutical treatment according to<br><br>
the present invention alone or in combination with one or more other pharmaceutically active agents. Such other pharmaceutically active agents include e.g. other antibiotics and antiinflammatory agents, and, if a compound of the present invention is used in the treatment of acne, other pharmaceutically agents include furthermore agents which are active against acne or used for the decolonization/sterilisation of bacterial carriers. Combinations include fixed combinations, in which two or more pharmaceutically active agents are in the same formulation; kits, in which two or more pharmaceutically active agents in separate formulations are sold in the same package, e.g. with instruction for co¬administration; and free combinations in which the pharmaceutically active agents are packaged separately, but instruction for simultaneous or sequential administration are given.<br>
In another aspect the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the present invention, e.g. including a compound of formula I, in free form or in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt; e.g. and/or in the form of a solvate; in association with at least one pharmaceutical, excipient, e.g. carrier or diluent, e.g. including fillers, binders, disintegrators, flow conditioners, lubricants, sugars and sweeteners, fragrances, preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents and/or emulsifiers, solubilizers, salts for regulating osmotic pressure and/or buffers.<br>
In another aspect the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention, further comprising another pharmaceutically active agent.<br>
Such pharmaceutical compositions may be manufactured according, e.g. analogously, to a<br>
method as conventional, e.g. by mixing, granulating, coating, dissolving or lyophilizing<br>
processes.<br>
Unit dosage form may contain, for example, from about 0.01 mg to about 3000 mg, such as<br>
1 mg to about 100 mg.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are additionally suitable as veterinary agents, e.g. veterinary active compounds, e.g. in the prophylaxis and in the treatment of microbial, e.g. bacterial diseases, in animals, such as fowl, pigs and calves; e.g. and for diluting fluids for artificial insemination and for egg-dipping techniques.<br>
In another aspect the present invention provides a compound of the present invention for<br><br>
use as a veterinary agent.<br>
In a further aspect the present invention provides a compound of the present invention for the preparation of a veterinary composition which is useful as a veterinary agent.<br>
In another aspect the present invention provides a veterinary method for the prophylaxis and in the treatment of microbial, e.g. bacterial diseases which comprises administering to a subject in need of such treatment an effective amount of a compound of the present invention, e.g. in the form of a veterinary composition.<br>
For use of the active compounds of the present invention as a veterinary agent, the dosage will of course vary depending upon the size and age of the animal and the effect desired; for example for prophylactic treatment relatively low doses would be administered over a longer time period, e.g. 1 to 4 weeks. Preferred doses in drinking water are from 0.0125 to 0.05 weight by volume, particularly 0.0125 to 0.025; and in foodstuffs from 20 to 400 g/metric ton, preferably 20 to 200 g/metric ton. It is preferred to administer the active compounds of the present invention as a veterinary agent to hens in drinking water, to pigs in foodstuff and to calves orally or parenterally, e.g. in the form of oral or parenteral preparations.<br>
