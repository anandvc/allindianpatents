Saw band and method for the production of a saw band<br>
The invention relates to a saw band for a circulating<br>
band-sawing machine according to the preamble of claim<br>
1. Furthermore, the invention relates to a method for<br>
the production of a saw band according to the preamble<br>
of claim 15.<br>
A saw band of the prior art is known for example from<br>
DE 102 02 770 A1. It is used in band-sawing machines,<br>
as described for example in DE 25 38 718 A1 and used in<br>
particular for sawing large work pieces that cannot be<br>
worked with circular saws. In spite of very great<br>
efforts with respect to improved material compositions<br>
for these saw bands, they are however only designed or<br>
suitable for relatively low cutting speeds and small<br>
feed rates and have very short edge lives, i.e. they<br>
usually become blunt very quickly and must be exchanged<br>
correspondingly often.<br>
It is also known to provide tools and components with<br>
coatings to increase wear resistance and corrosion<br>
protection. . Frequently, PVD (physical vapor<br>
deposition) or paCVD (plasma assisted chemical vapor<br>
deposition) methods or combinations of these are used<br>
for this purpose.<br>
The publication WO 2005/014877 Al discloses the coating<br>
of a steel strip in a roll-to-roll process, a layer of<br>
various hard materials being applied to one side, or in<br>
successive process steps to both sides, of the strip<br>
produced with preference from cold work steel.<br>
Subsequently, a saw band can be produced from this<br>
strip.<br>
A disadvantage in this case is that the coating is<br>
performed from the side. Consequently, the smallest<br>
 <br>
WO2006/089753	- 2 - PCT/EP2006/001669<br>
layer thickness is applied to the functional faces that<br>
are exposed most to wear (tool flank &amp; tool face) and<br>
the greatest layer thickness is applied to the side<br>
faces that are subjected to less loading, and<br>
consequently the costly coating material is poorly<br>
used. Moreover, the coating is often applied to cold<br>
work steels, which are only hardened subsequently,<br>
which may have disadvantageous effects on the<br>
layer/substrate bond. On the other hand, such cold<br>
work steels cannot be readily coated after hardening,<br>
since customary PVD processes far exceed the annealing<br>
temperature of such materials. Low-temperature PVD<br>
processes have in turn the disadvantage of producing<br>
layers with inferior adhesive bonding, which is a major<br>
disadvantage precisely in cases where there is great<br>
loading, as in the case of sawing, and abrasive wear.<br>
A further disadvantage is caused by the roll-to-roll<br>
process proposed in the prior art. This does not allow<br>
every saw geometry to be chosen, for example a set<br>
tooth geometry is not possible, since such bands cannot<br>
be wound, or only poorly. Since the layer thicknesses<br>
known in the prior art are much greater than 5 urn, they<br>
are expensive to produce and do not provide any<br>
significant improvement over uncoated saws, since there<br>
is the tendency for the layer to break off at the tip<br>
of the saw during running in, and consequently the<br>
advantages of the coating no longer have any effect<br>
there.<br>
It is therefore the object of the present invention to<br>
provide a saw band for a band-sawing machine and a<br>
method for the production of such a saw band that make<br>
it possible to obtain a much better performance,<br>
especially when working metallic materials.<br>
Furthermore, the cost-effectiveness is to be improved,<br>
both in the production and in the use of such a saw<br>
band.<br>
 <br>
WO2006/089753	- 3 - PCT/EP2006/001669<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by<br>
the features given in claim 1.<br>
The coating according to the invention of at least the<br>
row of teeth of the saw band according to the invention<br>
makes a very much longer edge life possible, which<br>
apart from the longer time for which these saw bands<br>
can be used also allows greater intervals between<br>
changing used saw bands.<br>
A further advantage of the saw band according to the<br>
invention is that of the consequently higher possible<br>
cutting speeds and perhaps higher possible feed rate.<br>
Furthermore, on account of the reduced friction, the<br>
coating can lead to very quiet and uniform running of<br>
the saw band, as a result of which considerably lower<br>
feeding forces are required.<br>
A saw band according to the invention or a<br>
corresponding band saw consists of an HSS- (high-speed<br>
steel) based material, on which a hard layer is applied<br>
by means of PVD or paCVD methods. By virtue of their<br>
greater thermal stability, high-speed steels are ideal<br>
for coating by PVD or paCVD processes, since the<br>
annealing temperatures of these steels are usually<br>
significantly above 500°C, and consequently coating in<br>
the range of 500°C is possible without any problem,<br>
which ensures significantly better layer/base material<br>
bonding in comparison with low-temperature processes.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the layer	thickness	on	the<br>
tool flank is greater than the layer	thickness	on	the<br>
side faces of a saw tooth of a band	according	to	the<br>
invention.<br>
Layers which are particularly well suited for saw<br>
coating are TiAlN and AlCrN layers, as can be produced<br>
for example on industrial coating systems of the type<br>
 <br>
WO2006/089753	- 4 - PCT/EP2006/001669<br>
BAI1200 or RCS. Further layers that have also yielded<br>
a significant increase in cutting performance, at least<br>
in special combinations of layers and materials to be<br>
worked, are combinations of TiAlN, AlCrN, CrN and the<br>
carbonitrides and carbides of the corresponding layers,<br>
for example also as multilayer or gradient layers with<br>
increasing carbon content, combined with metallic or<br>
metal-free DLC (diamond like carbon) outer layers, as<br>
well as various Si-containing layers, for example<br>
TiAlSiN, AlCrSiN and the corresponding carbonitrides<br>
with an Si content of between 1 and 12 atomic% in<br>
relation to the total metal content.<br>
Further particularly suited layer systems also comprise<br>
other hard materials, such as one or more metals of<br>
subgroups IV, V or VI of the periodic system<br>
(transition metals) or aluminum or silicon and their<br>
compounds. In particular, the nitrides, such as the<br>
known TiN, VN or TiSiN or SiN, carbides or<br>
carbonitrides, such as for example TiCN, VCN, borides,<br>
oxides such as for example Al2O3, (AlCr)2O3 and other<br>
mixtures of the corresponding non-metals, such as for<br>
example boronitrides, carbooxinitrides inter alia with<br>
the stated metals come into consideration for this.<br>
Multilayer systems as well as specially formed bonding<br>
and transitional layers may be of advantage for the<br>
working of specific materials.<br>
A coating of a nitride-based material has proven to be<br>
particularly advantageous with respect to the edge life<br>
and the cutting speeds and the feed rates. In<br>
advantageous refinements of this, the coating may<br>
comprise TiN, TiCN, TiAlN and/or AlCrN. All of these<br>
materials may also be used here as alloys or mixtures.<br>
A further coating that is very well suited for<br>
practical application may comprise WC/C as the outer<br>
layer, since this metal-containing DLC layer system has<br>
 <br>
WO2006/089753	- 5 - PCT/EP2006/001669<br>
a particularly good run-in behavior, for example layer<br>
smoothing during the first cutting cycles. The systems<br>
as mentioned above come into consideration in<br>
particular as the supporting layer.<br>
If, in an advantageous development of the invention,<br>
the coating has a thickness of 2 - 3 urn, this<br>
advantageously leads to very quiet, uniform running of<br>
the saw band and not to jamming or similar problems<br>
that could arise in the case of a coating with a<br>
greater thickness when sawing workpieces. However, the<br>
layer thickness also depends on the tooth division, the<br>
tooth geometry, the material to be worked and the<br>
material of the coating itself, as a result of which<br>
greater layer thicknesses may also be possible from<br>
case to case.<br>
To optimize the cutting performance of a saw coated<br>
according to the invention, the correct layer thickness<br>
must therefore be set. In this respect, it has<br>
surprisingly been found in tests that thinner layers,<br>
for instance between 0.5 and 3 m, in particular<br>
between 0.7 and 2 m, produce much better cutting<br>
results than thick layers, from a layer thickness of<br>
about 4 m and above. The latter were only able to<br>
achieve a small improvement, or no improvement at all,<br>
in the cutting behavior in comparison with uncoated<br>
bands.<br>
In a further refinement of the invention, it may be<br>
provided that the row of teeth consists of HSSE.<br>
Together with the coating according to the invention,<br>
this base material for the row of teeth leads to a<br>
particularly wear-resistant saw band.<br>
In the prior art, uncoated saws are usually used with a<br>
rake angle geometry of =0° for simple sawing tasks,<br>
such as the sawing of workpieces with a high carbon<br>
 <br>
WO2006/089753	- 6 - PCT/EP2006/001669<br>
content (for example cast iron) or for workpieces with<br>
small cross sections or thin-walled profiles and pipes.<br>
Here, coated saws with a rake angle geometry of α=0°<br>
can be used particularly advantageously for the sawing<br>
of hard materials, such as tool steels, for example<br>
X3 8CrMoV5-l, material number 1.2343 with a hardness of<br>
up to HB30 = 235. This is of particular advantage,<br>
since this saw band geometry can be produced more<br>
easily and at lower cost than geometries with a greater<br>
rake angle and possibly additionally curved tool face.<br>
Consequently, it is possible in spite of the additional<br>
coating to produce the bands for hard sawing operations<br>
or for the sawing of large solid geometries, in<br>
particular diameters, at low production costs. In<br>
addition, it has also been possible to test tooth<br>
geometries with a negative rake angle, so that a rake<br>
angle range between -5 and +5°, but with preference<br>
between -2 and 3°, comes into consideration for hard<br>
sawing with coated saw blades.<br>
In the case of very effectively lubricating soft<br>
materials, on the other hand, such as VA stainless<br>
steels, for example X6Crl7, material number 1.4016<br>
with a hardness of up to HB30 = 185, it has been<br>
possible to achieve the best results with an aggressive<br>
tooth geometry at a rake angle of α=10°. Similar<br>
results can be achieved in a range of α=10±3°.<br>
It has been possible to achieve a further improvement<br>
for various applications by beveling the tool flank at<br>
an angle between β3 = 1 and 5°, with preference β = 2 to<br>
3°.<br>
The object is achieved in terms of the method by the<br>
features of claim 15.<br>
A saw band coated according to the invention can be<br>
achieved with very good results in a method that can be<br>
 <br>
WO2006/089753	- 7 - PCT/EP2006/001669<br>
easily implemented if, in an advantageous development,<br>
the material forming the coating is applied by means of<br>
PVD or paCVD methods at a temperature of 450 - 550°C,<br>
preferably about 500 to 550°C.<br>
Furthermore, it may be provided that at least the row<br>
of teeth is brushed to remove burr before the coating<br>
is applied. As an alternative to this, at least the<br>
row of teeth may also be shot-peened to remove burr<br>
before the coating is applied. Such removal of burr<br>
from the row of teeth prevents the burr from breaking<br>
off during the later use of the saw band, which would<br>
result in an uncoated surface of the saw band.<br>
If, in an advantageous refinement of the method, only<br>
the row of teeth up to the transition to the band back<br>
is provided with the coating, this leads to a lowering<br>
of the costs for the production of the saw band<br>
according to the invention by saving coating material.<br>
This does not cause any reduction in the quality of the<br>
saw band according to the invention, since the non-<br>
coated band back has no cutting function. For this<br>
purpose it is possible, for example, to combine cut-to-<br>
length saw bands into stacks and coat them together,<br>
for example in known cartridge holders. In particular<br>
if the row of teeth consists of a different material<br>
than the band back, it may be advantageous if the row<br>
of teeth is welded to the band back.<br>
Furthermore, it may be provided that the saw band is<br>
welded to a ring after the coating. In this way,<br>
immediate use of the saw band in a band-sawing machine<br>
is possible.<br>
Very easy handling of the saw band during the coating<br>
is obtained if, in an advantageous development of the<br>
method according to the invention, the saw band is<br>
coated in the form of a coil, therefore wound into a<br>
 <br>
WO2006/089753	- 8 - PCT/EP2006/001669<br>
spiral before the coating and secured in this form in<br>
the coating installation, the rows of teeth then all<br>
pointing in the same direction. This procedure also<br>
leads to a considerable cost reduction for the method,<br>
since a relatively great saw band length can be coated<br>
simultaneously.<br>
According to the invention, a number of the spirally<br>
wound saw bands are mounted on holders and are coated<br>
together in one batch.<br>
In the figures:<br>
Figure 1 shows a tooth;<br>
Figure 2 shows a detail of a saw band;<br>
Figure 3 shows an uncoated tooth and a coated tooth in<br>
cross section; and<br>
Figure 4 shows a coating installation;<br>
Figure 5 to Figure 9 show diagrams of sawing tests<br>
with the saw band according to<br>
the invention.<br>
Figure 1 shows in a schematic detail a tooth 2 of a saw<br>
band 1 with a saw back 3, the tooth having a tool face<br>
4 with a rake angle , a tool flank 5 with a clearance<br>
angle β and a side face 7.<br>
The saw band may be formed as a closed ring and be<br>
fitted in a way known per se on a band-sawing machine.<br>
The direction of the cutting speed of the saw band 1 is<br>
indicated by the arrow designated by "v" in Figure 1.<br>
Such saw bands are used in band-sawing machines in both<br>
horizontal and vertical orientation. Depending on the<br>
type of use, the workpiece is then moved toward the saw<br>
band 1, or vice versa.<br>
In Figure 2, a detail of the saw band 1 is represented.<br>
Here it can be seen that the saw band 1 has a band back<br>
 <br>
WO2006/089753	- 9 - PCT/EP2006/001669<br>
10, on which the saw band i is guided within the band-<br>
sawing machine in a way that is not represented but is<br>
known per se, and also a row of teeth 11 having a<br>
number of teeth 2. The band back 10 preferably<br>
consists of a relatively simple, "soft" steel, whereas<br>
the row of teeth 11 consists of a high-speed steel,<br>
preferably of HSSE. The use of a more simple steel for<br>
the band back 10 allows costs to be saved and the<br>
flexibility of the saw band 1 to be increased. A<br>
welding method is to be preferred for connecting the<br>
row of teeth 11 to the band back 10.<br>
In order in particular to increase the edge life, but<br>
preferably also the cutting speed and perhaps the feed<br>
rate of the saw band 1, at least the row of teeth 11 is<br>
provided with a coating increasing the wear resistance.<br>
The coating, which cannot be seen in the drawings, may<br>
comprise, for example, a material as mentioned above or<br>
consist of such a material. The coating also<br>
contributes to a reduction in the cutting force of the<br>
saw band 1.<br>
Figure 3 schematically shows in cross section a tooth<br>
2' that is uncoated or coated with a conventional layer<br>
and also a tooth 2' ' that is coated with a layer<br>
according to the invention after prolonged use. The<br>
tip or geometry of the unused tooth is respectively<br>
represented by a dashed line 6. The uncoated tooth<br>
shows greater wearing of the tip 6' and rounding of the<br>
tip 6' in cross section after the same number of cuts.<br>
The coated tooth 2' ' , on the other hand, shows less<br>
wearing of its tip 6' ' and no or little rounding even<br>
after the layer has completely worn away. This has<br>
major advantages, since the guidance in the material<br>
that is ensured substantially by the edges of the tip 6<br>
is consequently retained and a straight cut is possible<br>
even when the saw band is severely worn, whereas a band<br>
with greatly rounded teeth 2' shows strong tendencies<br>
 <br>
WO2006/089753	- 10 - PCT/EP2006/001669<br>
to run untrue, which increases the rate or rejection<br>
and/or the material consumption.<br>
Figure 4 shows in a very schematic representation a<br>
coating installation 12, with which a method for the<br>
production of the saw band 1 described above for the<br>
band-sawing machine can be carried out. Within this<br>
coating installation 12, the coating described above,<br>
which increases the wear resistance of the saw band 1,<br>
is applied at least to the row of teeth 11. The<br>
installation 12, preferably in the form of a vacuum<br>
coating installation, comprises, though not<br>
represented, the installations that are necessary for<br>
coating, such as sputter targets, evaporator crucibles<br>
or arc sources (also combined) along with their<br>
electrical operating devices; as well as gas feeding<br>
and regulating devices, in order for example to be able<br>
to separate oxidic or nitridic layers; vacuum pumps to<br>
create the pressure conditions necessary for operating<br>
a PVD or paCVD method, as well as heating devices,<br>
measuring instruments and further auxiliary drives.<br>
Installations of this type are state of the art as<br>
installations for coating tools and components.<br>
In the present case, for coating the saw band 1, it is<br>
introduced into the coating installation 7 in a form<br>
wound up on a coil 8 and is suspended on a holder 9<br>
provided there. In this case, the coil 8 may have a<br>
diameter of up to 50 cm, which leads to an overall<br>
length of the saw band 1 of 100 m. Preferably, only<br>
the row of teeth 6 up to the transition of the same to<br>
the band back 10, that is to say substantially up to<br>
the respective tooth gullet, is provided with the<br>
coating, in order to save coating material. After the<br>
coating, the saw band 1 is removed from the<br>
installation 12 and can be welded in a way not<br>
represented to such a ring as that represented in<br>
Figure 1.<br>
 <br>
WO2006/089753	- 11 - PCT/EP2006/001669<br>
In order to avoid burr that is possibly located on the<br>
teeth 2 breaking off during the later use of the saw<br>
band 1, which would bring an uncoated region of the saw<br>
band 1 to its surface and consequently reduce its wear<br>
resistance considerably, in the present case at least<br>
the row of teeth 11 is brushed or shot-peened with<br>
relatively low pressure to remove burr before the<br>
coating is applied. After working, the respective<br>
tooth 5 has a small radius instead of the burr. In the<br>
case of brushing, a circulating brush may be used,<br>
brushing the saw band 1 wound up on the coil 8.<br>
Examples:<br>
Figure 5 shows very clearly the advantages of a saw<br>
band according to the invention. A pipe 91.45 x<br>
14.3 mm of 100Cr6, material No. 1.3505, was worked with<br>
a saw band with a TiAlN coating of about 1 to 2 μm<br>
(Balinit FuturaNano, process FN1) and a rake angle of<br>
0° at a cutting speed of 120 m/min. For an uncoated<br>
band, the cutting speed recommended by the<br>
manufacturer, namely 60 m/min, was used. The curves<br>
show the cutting time in dependence on the number of<br>
cuts. The upper curve shows the values for the<br>
uncoated band, the lower curve the values for the<br>
coated band. The overall cutting time for 3 00 parts<br>
with the coated saw band was 5 hours. The overall<br>
cutting time for 3 00 parts with the uncoated saw band<br>
was 8 hours and 24 minutes. After 3 00 cuts, the<br>
cutting time per cut of the coated band was already<br>
below half the cutting time of the uncoated band.<br>
Figure 6 shows two sawing tests on saw bands coated<br>
with about 1 to 2 pm of TiAlN (Balinit FuturaNano, as<br>
above) of different geometries on tool steel 80 x 80<br>
mm, X38CrMoV5-l, material No. 1.2343. The cutting<br>
speed was 90 m/min, the cutting pressure 16 bar and the<br>
 <br>
WO2006/089753	- 12 - PCT/EP2006/001669<br>
feed rate 4. The differences between the two bands lay<br>
exclusively in the tooth geometry, to be more precise<br>
the rake angle. It was found here, completely<br>
surprisingly, that the saw band with the smaller rake<br>
angle of 0° (curve with lozenge marking, at the bottom)<br>
was clearly superior to the saw band with the sharper<br>
rake angle of 10° (curve with square marking, in the<br>
middle), which is contrary to the experience with<br>
coated saw blades.<br>
In a comparative test shown here only for "10° bands"<br>
with uncoated bands at half the cutting speed, that is<br>
to say 45 m/min (according to the manufacturer's<br>
recommendation), and otherwise the same conditions as<br>
specified above, the saw band with a rake angle of 0°<br>
was already blunt after one third of the first cut, the<br>
saw band with a rake angle of 10° was already blunt<br>
after half the first cut. The test was therefore only<br>
continued with the "10° band" (curve with triangle<br>
marking, at the top) . However, already with the third<br>
cut, the cutting time was around 18 minutes, while the<br>
geometrically identical coated band required a cutting<br>
time of about 10 minutes, but the coated "0° band" only<br>
required a cutting time of about 6 minutes.<br>
Figure 7 shows a comparison of the cutting times of<br>
coated and uncoated saw bands of different tooth<br>
geometries. In this case, a solid heat-treatable steel<br>
C 45, material No. 1.0503, d = 100 mm was sawn. The<br>
sawing parameters for the coated bands were<br>
respectively set as follows. The first result is shown<br>
by column 1 of Figure 7.<br>
Cutting speed 12 0 m/min<br>
Cutting pressure 18 bar<br>
Feed rate 4.<br>
If uncoated bands are operated with the same<br>
parameters, the cut becomes what is known as untrue,<br>
 <br>
WO2006/089753	- 13 - PCT/EP2006/001669<br>
i.e. the cut runs out of line, which leads to<br>
rejection. Therefore, uncoated bands had to be<br>
operated at correspondingly lower cutting speed and<br>
pressure; the result is column 4 of Figure 7:<br>
Cutting speed 75 m/min<br>
Cutting pressure 12 bar<br>
Feed rate 3.<br>
This consequently allowed both for bands with a rake<br>
angle of 0° and bands with a rake angle of 10° to<br>
reduce the cutting time by about 50% as a result of the<br>
coating and it thereby being possible for the first<br>
time to operate at higher cutting speed and pressure.<br>
However, with the chosen cutting parameters, it was<br>
only possible to achieve a planar cut for "0° saw<br>
bands". In the case of coated and uncoated "10°<br>
bands", on the other hand, a convexity of the cut<br>
surface with a maximum deviation of 1 mm from the cut<br>
plane was established, which would lead to either<br>
rejection or reworking of the workpieces.<br>
Figures 8 and 9 show the results of sawing tests with<br>
saw blades of different geometries (types 1-3) with<br>
rake angles of 0°/10° in coated and uncoated versions.<br>
The workpiece in Figure 8 was ferritic stainless steel,<br>
X6Crl7, material 1.4016. The width of cut was<br>
d=102 mm, the cutting speed 12 0 m/min and the feeding<br>
pressure 6.0. In Figure 9, heat-treatable steel,<br>
42CrMo4, material No. 1.7225 was worked with a depth of<br>
cut of d = 90 mm, a cutting speed of 90 m/min and a<br>
feeding pressure of 4.4. In all cases, the superiority<br>
of coated saw bands over uncoated saw bands was<br>
evident.<br>
In the relatively soft ferritic stainless steel, the<br>
best cutting result was achieved with a coated saw<br>
blade with a rake angle of 10°. In the relatively hard<br>
heat-treatable steel, however, the best result was<br>
 <br>
WO2006/089753	- 14 - PCT/EP2006/001669<br>
achieved with a coated, band with a rake angle of 0°,<br>
which is all the more astounding since an uncoated band<br>
with this rake angle yielded the poorest results.<br>
A further sawing test was carried out on solid heat-<br>
treatable steel/cold extruding steel 42CrMo4V, material<br>
No. 1.7225, d=300 mm at a cutting speed of 50 m/min, a<br>
cutting pressure of 16 bar and a feed rate of 3,<br>
determining the edge life and total cut area of an<br>
uncoated saw band with a rake angle of 16° and a coated<br>
saw band with a rake angle of 0°. In this case, the<br>
uncoated band was worn after 6 hours, a total quantity<br>
of 21 cuts and a total cut area of 1.48 m2. With the<br>
coated band, it was possible within its useful life of<br>
8 hours and 53 minutes to achieve 31 cuts and a total<br>
cut area of 2.19 m2, which corresponds to an increase<br>
in the quantity of cuts and total cut area of just<br>
under 50%.<br>
In addition, it was found in long-time sawing tests, in<br>
which pipe material with a diameter of 91 mm, a wall<br>
thickness of 16 mm of 16MnCr5, material No. 1.7131 (HB<br>
140 to 207) was sawn, that in the case of an uncoated<br>
saw band with a rake angle of 10° the cut ran out of<br>
the angle by 1 mm over the diameter after 500 to 600<br>
cuts. On the other hand, with an identical, but<br>
 coated, saw band, 900 to 1200 cuts could be achieved<br>
without observing that the band ran out of the angle.<br>
This is all the more surprising since coated saw bands<br>
still maintain the angle even when they are blunt at<br>
the end of their service life. Consequently, an<br>
automated overnight sawing operation is quite possible<br>
for example.<br>
