				<td>This invention relates to a process for the preparation of S(-) Amlodipine salts. More particularly it relates to a process for the preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable salt of S(-)Amlodipine selected from the group consisting of besylate, succinate, maleate, oxalate and tosylate. The S (-) Amlodipine salts of general formula (1)<br><br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Wherein R is selected from the group consisting of benzene sulfonic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, oxalic acid and p-toluene sulfonic acid.<br>
These S(-)Amlodipine salts are prepared from S(-)Amlodipine, wherein S(-)Amlodipine is prepared by a procedure as described and claimed in our co-pending Indian patent-application No. 262/Del/2002.<br>
Of all the salts of S (-) Amlodipine mentioned above, the compound S (-) Amlodipine besylate; (4-S)-2- {[(2-aminoethyl)oxy]methyl} -4-(2-chlorophenyl)-6-methyl-1,4-dihydropyridine-3,5-dicarboxylate benzene sulfonate has commercial importance and is a potent and long acting calcium channel blocker.<br>
(R,S)-Amlodipine besylate is currently being used for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders, in particular in the treatment of hypertension and angina, Amlodipine is racemic compound and has chiral center at 4 position of dihydropyridine ring. The S(-) isomer is having calcium channel blocker activity while the R(+)-isomer has little or no calcium channel blocking activity.<br>
The compound R,S-Amlodipine is a potent and long acting calcium channel blocker having utility as an anti-ischaenic and anti-hypertensive agent. Although amlodipine is effective as the free base in practice it is best administered in the form of a salt of pharmaceutically acceptable acid, such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, maleate, fumarate, tartarate and besylate.<br>
Of these salts besylate is disclosed as being particularly preferred as it has good solubility, good stability, nonhygroscopicity and processability for tablet formation (Ger. Offen. -DE - 3710457, 1988, Edward Davison, James Ingram Wells). In the prior art the preparation of R and S enantiomers of Amlodipine have been reported by resolution of amlodipine azide ester with optically active 2-methoxy-2-phenylethanol [J. Med. Chem., 29, 1696, 1986. I.E. Arrowsmith, S.F. Campbell, P.E.Cross, J.K. Stabs, R.A. Surges and EP Appl. 0331315A)] or resolution of Amlodipine base with optically active camphanic acid [J. Med. Chem., 35, 3341, 1992, S. Goldman, J. Stoltefuss and L. Born ] or resolution of RS-amlodipine base to R(+) and S(-) isomer with L or D-tartaric acid respectively in organic solvent DMSO, [ Peter L. Spargo US patent 6, 046,338; (2000), PCT 95/25722 (1995)] which indicate the use of both tartaric acids is essential.<br>
Preparation of R and S amlodipine maleate salt has been reported starting from azido precursor. The procedure involves resolution of azido precursor using 2-methoxy-2-phenyl ethanol as a resolving agent, separation of diastereomer, ester exchange with sodium methoxide, hydrogenation, chromatographic purification and maleate salt formation. (J. Med. Chem, 29, 1896, 1986. J.E. Arrowsmith, S.F. Campbell, P.E.Cross, J.K. Stabs, R.A. Surges).<br>
Preparation of preferred amlodipine besylate salt has been disclosed in the publication (J. Chrom.B 693 (1997) 367-375 J. Luksa, Dj. Josic, B.Podobnik, B. Furlan, M. Kremser) describing the treatment of ethanolic solution of base with benzene sulfonic acid and isolation. The detailed procedures to obtain these salts have not been provided by the prior art. These prior art references also lack in providing physical or structural data given except the optical rotation except maleate.<br>
The main object of the present invention therefore to provide a process for the preparation of S (-) Amlodipine salts<br>
Another object is to  provide the process to obtain the salts in good yields . Yet another object is to obtain the salts with high enantiomeric purity.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the preparation of S (-) Amlodipine salts of formula (1)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R is selected fro the group consisting of benzene sulfonic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, oxalic acid and p-toluene sulfonic acid, which comprises reacting S (-) amlodipine base with an aqueous solution of an acid with a molar ratio of S (-) amlodipine base to acid in the range of 1.2 : 1.0 to 1.0 : 1.2, in the presence of an organic solvent with a ratio of organic solvent to amlodipine in the range of 1.2 : 1.0 to 1.0 : 1.2 (v/w) under stirring at a temperature in the range of 20-30° C, filtering the above said reaction mixture to obtain the solid mass and washing with cold water and hexane respectively followed by drying at a temperature of 35-45°C under vacuo to obtain the desired product in solid form.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the organic solvent used is selected from the group consisting of alcohol, hydrocarbon and polar solvent.<br>
In an another embodiment the organic solvent used is selected from the group consisting of dimethyl sulfoxide, 2-propanol, ethanol, methanol and toluene.<br>
In yet another embodiment the acid used is selected from the group consisting of benzene sulfonic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, oxalic acid and p-toluene sulfonic acid.<br>
In still another embodiment the water to organic solvent ratio used is in the range of 5:1 to 8:1<br>
The unique feature of the invention is production of S (-) amlodipine besylate with the quality required for preparation of pharmaceutical composition i.e. tablet formulation.<br>
