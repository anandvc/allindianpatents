				<td>BREATH SAMPLING BAG AND GAS MEASURING APPARATUS The present invention relates to breath sampling bag and gas measuring apparatus for spectrometrically measuring the concentration of an isotopic gas on the basis of a difference in the light absorption characteristics of the isotope. Isotopic analyses are useful for diagnosis of a disease in a medical application, in which metabolic functions of a living body can be determined by measuring a change in the concentration or concentration ratio of an isotope after administration of a drug containing the isotope.   In the other fields, the isotopic analyses are used for studies of the photosynthesis and metabolism of plants, and for ecological tracing in a geochernical application.<br>
It is generally known that gastric ulcer and gastritis are caused by bacteria called helicobacter pylori (HP) as well as by a stress. If the HP is present in the stomach of a patient, an antibiotic or the like should be administered to the patient for bacteria removal treatment. Therefore, it is indispensable to check if the patient has the HP. The HP has<br>
a strong urease activity for decomposing urea into carbon dioxide and ammonia.<br>
Carbon has isotopes having mass numbers of 12, 13 and 14,<br>
among which 13C having a mass number of 13 is easy to handle<br>
because of its non-radioactivity and stability.<br>
If the concentration of  13 C02 (a final metabolic product)<br><br>
or the concentration ratio of 13CO2 to 12CO2 in breath of a patient is successfully measured after urea labeled with the isotope 13C is administered to the patient, the presence of the HP can be confirmed.<br>
However, the concentration ratio of 12CO2 to 12C02 in naturally occurring carbon dioxide is 1:100.  Therefore, it is difficult to determine the concentration ratio in the breath of the patient with high accuracy.<br>
There have been known methods for determining the concentration ratio of  13CO2 to 12C02 by means of infrared spectroscopy (see JPB 61(1986)-42219 and JPB 61(1986)-42220).<br>
In the method disclosed in JPB 61(1986)-42220, two cells respectively having a long path and a short path are provided,<br>
the path lengths of which are adjusted such that the light<br>
absorption by13  C02 in one cell is equal to the light<br>
absorption by  12CO2 in the other cell.  Light beams<br>
transmitted through the two cells are lead to spectrometric means, in which the light intensities are measured at wavelengths each providing the maximum sensitivity.  In<br>
accordance with this method, the light absorption ratio can be adjusted to "1" for the concentration ratio of 13CO2 to 12CO2 in naturally occurring carbon dioxide. If the concentration ratio is changed, the light adsorption ratio also changes by the amount of a change in the concentration ratio. Thus, the change in the concentration ratio can be determined by measuring a change in the light absorption ratio.<br>
In the infrared spectroscopic measurement, breath is sampled in breath sampling bags before and after a diagnostic drug is administered to a living body, and the breath samples in the breath sampling bags are respectively measured for determination of the 13CO2 concentration or the 13CO2 concentration ratio.<br>
The measurement of such breath samples is typically performed in a professional manner in a measurement organization, which manipulates a large amount of samples in a short time. Therefore, breath samples obtained before and after the drug administration are often mistakenly manipulated.<br>
More specifically, breath samples obtained from one patient before and after the drug administration are mistaken for those obtained from another patient, or a breath sample obtained before the drug administration is mistaken for that obtained after the drug administration.<br>
Such mistakes lead to erroneous measurement results and, therefore, should be assuredly prevented.<br>
Further, if a breath sample includes a gas remaining in the oral cavity of a patient, the measurement accuracy is reduced. To reduce a measurement error, breath from the lung of the patient should be sampled.<br>
Still further, since moisture in a breath sample adversely affect the optical measurement, the moisture should be removed from the breath sample. Furthermore, a consideration should be given to the breath sampling bag to prevent the breath sample from escaping from the bag.<br>
It is object to the present invention to provide a breath sampling bag, which is given a consideration to assuredly prevent a breath sample from being mistakenly manipulated.<br>
It is yet another object to the present invention to provide a breath sampling bag, which prevents the sampling of air present in the oral cavity of a patient but allows the sampling of breath from the lung of the patient.<br>
It is still another object of the present invention to provide a breath sampling bag, which is capable of removing moisture from breath blow therein.<br>
It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a breath sampling bag, which has a construction to prevent a breath sample from being escaped therefrom.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a breath sampling bag comprising a plurality of breath accumulating chambers joined together for respectively accumulating a plurality of breath  samples   and  a plurality of breath introduction pipes to be respectively connected to a plurality of breath inlets of a gas measuring apparatus for breath measurement to introduce the breath samples from the respective breath accumulating chambers into the gas measuring apparatus, and characterized in that breath introduction pipes are each configured such that diameters, lengths or cross sections of the breath introduction pipes are different so as not to be connected to wrong breath inlets of the gas measuring apparatus.<br>
According to the present invention there is also provided a gas measuring apparatus which is adapted to measure a plurality of breath samples accumulated in a breath sampling bag, comprising a plurality of breath inlets for introducing the breath samples from the breath accumulating chambers of the breath sampling bag through the breath introduction pipes, and characterized in that the breath inlets are each configured such that the breath inlets have different diameters, lengths or cross sections so as not to be connected to wrong breath introduction pipes.<br>
With the breath sampling bag and gas measuring apparatus of the aforesaid constructions, such an inconvenient accident can be eliminated that one breath sample in one breath accumulating chamber of the breath sampling bag is introduced into the gas measuring apparatus mistakenly for another breath sample in another breath -accumulating chamber.<br>
Where breath is sampled from a living body before and after a diagnostic drug is administered to the living body and the 13C02 concentration or  C02 concentration ratio of the breath samples is measured, for example, the manipulation mistake of the breath samples obtained before and after the administration of the diagnostic drug for measurement can be prevented.  Further, where a load test is performed and breath is sampled at a predetermined time interval after the administration of a diagnostic drug, breath samples thus obtained are prevented from being measured in a wrong order.<br>
The breath introduction pipes or the breath inlets are, for example, asymmetrically configured for prevention of the connection mistake of the breath sampling bag.  For asymmetrical configuration, the plurality of breath introduction pipes may have different diameters, lengths and cross-sections, and the plurality of breath inlets may have<br>
different diameters, lengths and cross-sections corresponding to those of the respective breath introduction pipes.<br>
Another breath sampling bag in accordance with the present invention includes a breath accumulating chamber for accumulating breath and a breath introduction pipe for introducing the breath from a living body into the breath accumulating chamber, the breath introduction pipe having a resistance generating means for generating a resistance to the blowing of the breath during the sampling of the breath (claim<br>
2)<br>
With this construction, the provision of the resistance<br>
generating means prevents the sampling of breath present in the oral cavity of the living body, but enables the sampling of breath from the lung thereof.  Thus, a measurement error can be reduced.<br>
The resistance generating means is embodied by allowing the interior of the breath introduction pipe to have some change which generates a resistance to the blowing of the breath.  For example, the inner diameter of the breath introduction pipe may be reduced or, alternatively, a resistance component may be provided on the interior of the breath introduction pipe.<br>
Further another breath sampling bag in accordance with the present invention includes a breath accumulating chamber for accumulating breath and a breath introduction pipe for<br>
introducing the breath from a living body into the breath accumulating chamber, the breath introduction pipe having a detachable filter for removing moisture from the breath during the sampling of the breath (claim 30)<br>
With this construction, the moisture in the breath can be removed therefrom by means of the filter, so that a reduction in the optical measurement accuracy can be prevented.  The removal of moisture is particularly effective for infrared spectrometry.<br>
Still another breath sampling bag in accordance with the present invention includes a breath accumulating chamber for accumulating breath and a breath introduction pipe for introducing the breath from a living body into the breath accumulating chamber, the breath introduction pipe having a valve for preventing the back flow of the breath during the<br>
-r' -<br>
sampling of the breath (claim 4)<br>
With this construction, the provision of the back-flow prevention valve in the breath introduction pipe prevents the breath from leaking out of the breath sampling bag.<br>
Another gas measuring apparatus in accordance with the present invention, which is adapted to measure a breath sample contained in a breath sampling bag including a breath accumulating chamber for accumulating the breath sample and a breath introduction pipe with a back-flow prevention valve for introducing the breath sample from a living body into the<br>
breath accumulating chamber, includes a breath inlet for introducing therein the breath sample from the breath sampling bag through the breath introduction pipe, the breath inlet having means for disabling the function of the valve with the breath introduction pipe being connected to the breath inlet (claim 6).<br>
With this construction, the function of the valve can be disabled with the breath introduction pipe being connected to the breath inlet when the breath sample is to be introduced into the gas measuring apparatus through the breath introduction pipe.  Therefore, the breath sample can be smoothly introduced into the gas measuring apparatus.<br>
The means for disabling the function of the valve is embodied, for example, by providing a long pin projecting from the breath inlet, which is adapted to forcibly open the valve when the breath introduction pipe is connected to the breath inlet.<br>
The foregoing and other objects and features of the present invention will become apparent from the following description with reference to the attached drawings.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will<br>
hereinafter be described with reference to the attached<br>
drawings.  The embodiment is adapted for a case where a  °13C02<br>
concentration or concentration ratio 13Conc/  Cone in a breath test sample is spectrometrically determined after administration of an urea diagnostic drug labeled with an isotope 13C. I. Breath test<br><br>
Before the urea diagnostic drug is administered to a patient, breath of the patient is sampled in a breath sampling bag.  The volume of the breath sampling bag may be about 250ml.  Then, the urea diagnostic drug is administered to the patient and, after a lapse of 10 to 15 minutes, breath of the patient is sampled in the breath sampling bag in the same manner as in the previous breath sampling.<br>
Fig. 5 is a view illustrating the appearance of the breath sampling bag 1 to be connected to nozzles N1 and N2 of an apparatus for spectrometrically measuring an isotopic gas. The breath sampling bag 1 includes a breath sampling chamber la for sampling breath of the patient after the administration of the urea diagnostic drug and a breath sampling chamber Ib for sampling breath of the patient before the administration of the urea diagnostic drug, the breath sampling chambers la and Ib being integrally molded and joined together to form a single body.<br>
A pipe 2a is attached to an end of the breath sampling chamber la, and a pipe 2b is attached to an end of the breath , sampling chamber 1b.  Bottom ends 5a and 5b of the breath sampling chambers la and 1b are closed.  The pipes 2a and 2b each have two functions, i.e., the pipes 2a and 2b serve not only as breath blowing ports from which breath is blown into the breath sampling chambers la and Ib, but also, for introducing the breath samples from the breath sampling<br><br>
chambers la and 1b into the spectrometric apparatus when the<br>
breath sampling bag is connected to the nozzles N^ and N2 of<br>
the apparatus.<br>
When breath is sampled, a cylindrical filter (like<br>
cigarette filter) 7a or 7b is fitted into the pipe 2a or 2b,<br>
and then the breath is blown into the breath sampling bag 1.<br>
The filters 7a and 7b are used to remove moisture in the<br>
breath.<br>
As shown in Fig. 6, back-flow valves 3a and 3b are<br>
provided in the pipes 2a and 2b, respectively, for preventing<br>
the breath blown into the'breath sampling bag from flowing<br>
back.<br>
The pipes 2a and 2b each have a portion having a smaller inner diameter (e.g., a smaller diameter portion 4a or 4b) for generating a resistance to the blowing of the breath.  The resistance to the blowing of the breath allows the patient to exhale air from his lung.  It has been experimentally confirmed that air exhaled from the lung of a patient provides a more stable CO2 concentration than air present in the oral cavity of the patient.<br>
After the completion of the sampling of the breath, the filters are removed, and the pipes 2a and 2b are inserted into the nozzles N1 and N2 respectively, of the spectrometric apparatus.  The nozzles N1 and N2 have different inner diameters, and the pipes 2a and 2b have different outer<br><br>
diameters corresponding to the inner diameters of the nozzles N1 and N2  This prevents the pipes 2a and 2b from being inserted into wrong nozzles N£ and N-^, thereby preventing the breath samples obtained before and after the administration of the urea diagnostic drug from being mistakenly manipulated.<br>
The nozzles N1 and N2 of the spectrometric apparatus have projections 6a and 6b, respectively, which are adapted to disable the function of the back-flow valves 3a and 3b when the pipes 2a and 2b are inserted into the nozzles N1 and No.<br>
•<br>
Although the outer diameters of the pipes 2a and 2b are made different in this embodiment, any other constructions may be employed to prevent the mistake of connection between the pipes 2a and 2b and the nozzles N1 and N2.  For example, the pipes may have different lengths and the nozzles N1 and N2 of the spectrometric apparatus may have different depths corresponding to the lengths of the pipes.  With this construction, a longer one of the pipes mistakenly inserted into a nozzle having a smaller depth fails to perfectly fit in the nozzle.  Therefore, a user notices the connection mistake of the pipes.  Alternatively, the pipes may have different cross sections (e.g., round, rectangular or triangular cross sections).<br>
Upon completion of the connection of the breath sampling bag 1, the spectrometric apparatus performs the following automatic control.<br><br>
II.   Apparatus   for   spectrometrically  measuring   isotnpic gas Fig.   7   is  a  block  diagram  illustrating   the  overall<br>
construction of the apparatus  for spectrometrically measuring<br>
an  isotopic  gas.<br>
The breath sampling bag is set to the apparatus so that<br>
one breath sampling chamber thereof containing the breath<br>
\ sampled after the drug administration (hereinafter referred to<br>
as "sample gas") and the other breath sampling chamber thereof containing the breath (hereinafter referred to as "base gas" ) sampled before the drug administration are connected to the nozzles N1 and N2, respectively.  The nozzle N1 is connected to one port of a three-way valve V1 through a transparent resin pipe (hereinafter referred to simply as "pipe") and the nozzle N2 is connected to one port of a three-way valve ^2 through a pipe.<br>
A reference gas (any gas having no absorption at a wavelength for measurement, e.g., nitrogen gas) is supplied from a gas cylinder to the apparatus.  The reference gas flows through a flow path diverged into two paths.  One path is connected through a flow meter M1 to a reference cell l1c. The other path is connected through a flow meter M2 to one port of a three-way valve V3.  The reference gas flows into the reference cell l1c, and discharged therefrom.<br>
The other ports of the three-way valve V3 are connected to another port of the three-way valve V1 and to a first<br><br>
sample cell lla for measuring a  C0.2 absorbance.  The other ports of the three-way valve v2 are connected to the first sample cell lla through a two-way valve V4 and to the other port of the three-way valve V1.<br>
A gas injector 21 (volume: 60cc) for quantitatively injecting the sample gas or the base gas is interposed between the three-way valve V3 and the first sample cell lla.  The gas injector 21 is a syringe-like device having a piston and a cylinder.  The piston is driven by cooperation of a motor, a screw connected to the motor and a nut fixed to the piston (which will be described later).<br>
As shown in Fig. 7, a cell chamber 11 has the first<br>
sample cell lla having a smaller length for measuring therein<br><br><br>
a   12CO2 absorbance, a second sample cell l1b having a greater<br>
length for measuring therein a  13CO2 absorbance, and the<br>
reference cell l1c through which the reference gas is passed. The first sample cell lla conununicates with the second sample cell l1b.  The sample gas or the base gas is introduced into the first sample cell lla and then into the second cell lib, and discharged therefrom.  The reference gas is introduced into the reference cell lie, and then discharged therefrom. Specifically, the first and second sample cells lla and lib have lengths of 13mm and 250mm, respectively, and the reference cell l1c has a length of 236mm.<br>
A discharge pipe extending from the second sample cell<br><br>
l1b is provided with an O2 sensor 18.  Usable as the 02 sensor 18 are commercially available oxygen sensors such as a solid electrolyte gas sensor (e.g., zirconia sensor) and an electrochemical gas sensor (e.g., galvanic cell sensor).<br>
A reference character L denotes an infrared light source having two waveguides 23a and 23b for guiding infrared rays for irradiation.  The generation of the infrared rays may be achieved in any way.  For example, a ceramic heater (surface temperature: 450°C) and the like can be used.  A rotary chopper 22 for periodically blocking the infrared rays is provided adjacent to the infrared light source L.  Infrared rays emitted from the infrared light source L are transmitted to the first sample cell lla and the reference cell lie through a first light path, and to the second sample cell lib through a second light path (see Fig. 8).<br>
A reference character D denotes an infrared detector for detecting the infrared rays transmitted through the cells. The infrared detector D has a first wavelength filter 24a and a first detection element 25a disposed in the first light path, and a second wavelength filter 24b and a second detection element 25b disposed in the second light path.<br>
The first wavelength filter 24a (band width: about 20nm) passes an infrared ray having a wavelength of about 4,280nm to be used for measurement of a 12C02 absorbance.  The second wavelength filter 24b (band width: about 50nm) passes an<br><br>
infrared ray having a wavelength of about 4,412nm to be used for measurement of a  C02 absorbance.  Usable as the first and second detection elements 25a and 25b are any elements capable of detecting infrared rays.  For example, a semiconductor infrared sensor such as of PbSe is used.<br>
The first wavelength filter 24a and the first detection element 25a are housed in a package 26a filled with an inert gas such as Ar. Similarly, the second wavelength filter 24b and the second detection element 25b are housed in a package 26b filled with an inert gas.<br>
The whole infrared detector D is maintained at a constant temperature (25°C) by means of a heater and a Peltier element. The inside temperatures of the packages 26a and 26b are kept at 0°C by means of a Peltier element.<br>
The cell chamber 11 is formed of a stainless steel, and vertically and laterally sandwiched between metal plates (e.g., brass plates) 12.  A heater 13 is provided on upper, lower and lateral sides of the cell chamber.  The cell chamber 11 is sealed with insulators 14 such as of polystyrene foam with the heater 13 interposed therebetween.  Though not shown, a temperature sensor (e.g., a platinum temperature sensor) for measuring the temperature of the cell chamber 11 is provided in the cell chamber 11.<br>
The cell chamber 11 has two tiers.  The first sample cell lla and the reference cell l1c   are disposed in one tier, and<br><br>
the second sample cell l1b is disposed in the other tier.<br>
The first light path extends through the first sample cell lla and the reference cell l1c which are disposed in series, and the second light path extends through the second sample cell b.  Reference characters 15, 16 and 17 denote sapphire transmission windows through which the infrared rays are transmitted.<br>
Fig. 9 is a block diagram illustrating a mechanism for adjusting the temperature of the cell chamber 11.  The temperature adjustment mechanism is constituted by the temperature sensor 32 provided in the cell chamber 11, a temperature adjustment substrate 31 and the heater 13.  The temperature of the temperature adjustment substrate 31 may be adjusted in any manner.  For example, the temperature adjustment can be achieved by changing the duty ratio of a pulse current flowing through the heater 13 on the basis of a temperature measurement signal of the temperature sensor 32. The heater 13 is controlled on the basis of this temperature adjustment method so as to maintain the cell chamber 11 at a constant temperature (40°C).<br>
Figs. 10A and 10B are a plan view and a side view, respectively, of the gas injector 21 for quantitatively injecting a gaseous sample.<br>
The gas injector 21 includes a cylinder 21b disposed on a base 21a, a piston 21c inserted in the cylinder 21c, and a<br><br>
movable nut 21d connected to the piston 21c, a feed screw 21e threadingly meshed with the nut 21d and a motor 21f for rotating the feed screw 21e which are disposed below the base 21a.<br>
The motor 21f is driven for forward and backward rotation by a driving circuit not shown.  As the feed screw 21e is rotated by the rotation of the motor 21f, the nut 21d moved forward or backward depending on the rotational direction of the feed screw 21e.  The piston 21c advances toward a position indicated by a dashed line in Fig. 10A.  Thus, the gas injector 21 can be flexibly controlled to introduce and extract the gaseous sample in/from the cylinder 21b. Ilia. Measuring procedure 1<br>
The measuring procedure includes reference gas measurement, base gas measurement, reference gas measurement, sample gas measurement and reference gas measurement, which are to be performed in this order.  Alternatively, base gas measurement, reference gas measurement and base gas measurement, and sample gas measurement, reference gas measurement and sample gas measurement may be performed in this order.  In the latter case, the base gas measurement and the sample gas measurement are each performed twice and, therefore, the operation efficiency is reduced.  The former measuring procedure which is more efficient will hereinafter be described.<br><br>
During the measurement, the reference gas constantly flows through the reference cell l1c, and the flow rate thereof is always kept constant by the flow meter Mj. IIIa-1. Reference measurement<br>
As shown in Fig. 11, the clean reference gas is passed through a gas flow path and the cell chamber 11 of the spectrometric apparatus at a rate of 200ml/minute for about 15 seconds for cleaning the gas flow path and the cell chamber 11.<br>
In turn, as shown in Fig. 12, the gas flow path is changed, and then the reference gas is passed therethrough for cleaning the gas flow path and the cell chamber 11.  After a lapse of about 30 seconds, light intensity are measured by means of the detection elements 25a and 25b.<br>
On the basis of the reference measurement, absorbances are calculated.<br>
The light intensity thus obtained by the first and second detection elements 25a and 25b are represented by 1^R1 and<br>
Rj_, respectively. IIIa-2. Rase gas measurement<br>
The base gas is sucked into the gas injector 21 from the breath sampling bag with the reference gas prevented from flowing through the first and second sample cells lla and lib (see Fig. 13).<br>
Thereafter, the base gas is mechanically pushed out at a<br><br>
constant rate (60ml/minute) by the gas injector 21 as shown in Fig. 14 and, at the same time, light intensity are measured by means of the detection elements 25a and 25b.<br>
The light intensity thus obtained by the first and second detection elements 25a and 25b are represented by ^B an(3 13B^ respectively. IIIa-3. Reference measurement<br>
The cleaning of the gas flow path and the cells and the light intensity measurement on the reference gas are performed again (see Figs. 11 and 12).<br>
The light intensity thus obtained by the first and second<br>
i *? detection elements 25a and 25b are represented by  R? and<br>
1 "3<br>
R£/ respectively. IIIa-4. Sample gas measurement<br>
The sample gas is sucked into the gas injector 21 from the breath sampling bag with the reference gas prevented from flowing through the first and second sample cells lla and lib (see Fig. 15).<br>
Thereafter, the sample gas is mechanically pushed out at a constant rate (60ml/minute) by the gas injector 21 as shown in Fig. 16 and, at the same time, light intensity are measured by means of the detection elements 25a and 25b.<br>
The light intensity thus obtained by the first and second<br>
detection elements  25a and 25b are represented  by -12S  and       13S, respectively.<br><br>
IIIa-5. Reference measurement<br>
The cleaning of the gas flow path and the cells and the light intensity measurement on the reference gas are performed again (see Figs. 11 and 12).<br>
The light intensity thus obtained by the first and second detection elements 25a and 25b are represented by 12R3 and<br>
R3, respectively. Illb. Measurement procedure 2<br>
In the measurement procedure 1, the CO2 concentrations of the base gas and the sample gas are not adjusted to the same level.<br>
If the base gas and the sample gas are at the same CO2 concentration level, the ranges of  CO2 and 1^C02 calibration curves to be used for determination of the concentrations can be narrowed.  By using limited ranges of the calibration curves, the measurement accuracy can be increased.<br>
In accordance with the measurement procedure 2, the CC&gt;2 concentrations of the base gas and the sample gas are adjusted to substantially the same level.  First, the CC&gt;2 concentrations of the base gas and the sample gas are measured in a preliminary measurement.  If the CO2 concentration of the base gas obtained in the preliminary measurement is higher than the CO2 concentration of the sample gas obtained in the preliminary measurement, the base gas is diluted to a CO2 concentration level equivalent to that of the sample gas, and<br><br>
the measurement of the concentration is performed on the base gas and then on the sample gas in a main measurement.<br>
If the C02 concentration of the base gas obtained in the preliminary measurement is lower than the CO2 concentration of the sample gas obtained in the preliminary measurement, the C02 concentration of the base gas is measured in the main measurement.  The sample gas is diluted to a C02 concentration level equivalent to that of the base gas, and then the CO2 concentration thereof is measured.<br>
The measurement procedure 2 includes preliminary base gas measurement, preliminary sample gas measurement, reference gas measurement, base gas measurement, reference gas measurement, sample gas measurement and reference gas measurement, which are performed in this order. IIIb-1. Preliminary base gas measurement<br>
The clean reference gas is passed through the gas flow path and the cell chamber 11 of the spectrometric apparatus for cleaning the gas flow path and the cell chamber 11 and, at the same time, a reference light intensity is measured.<br>
In turn, the base gas is sucked into the gas injector 21 from the breath sampling bag, and then mechanically pushed out at a constant flow rate by means of the gas injector 21.  At this time, the intensity of light transmitted through the base gas is measured by means of the detection element 25a to determine an absorbance, and the C02 concentration of the base<br><br>
gas is determined on the basis of the absorbance by using a<br>
calibration curve.<br>
IIIb-2. Preliminary sample gas measurement<br>
The clean reference gas is passed through the gas flow path and the cell chamber 11 of the spectrometric apparatus for cleaning the gas flow path and the cell chamber 11 and, at the same time, a reference light intensity is measured.<br>
In turn, the sample gas is sucked into the gas injector 21 from the breath sampling bag, and then mechanically pushed out at a constant flow rate by means of the gas injector 21. At this time, the intensity of light transmitted through the sample gas is measured by means of the detection element 25a to determine an absorbance, .and the CO2 concentration of the sample gas is determined on the basis of the absorbance by using the calibration curve. IIIb-3. Reference measurement<br>
The gas flow path is changed, and then the reference gas is passed therethrough to clean the gas flow path and the cell chamber 11.  After a lapse of about 30 seconds, light intensity are measured by means of the detection elements 25a and 25b.<br>
The light intensity thus obtained by the first and second<br>
i 2 detection elements 25a and 25b are represented by -^R^ and<br><br>
13R1 respectively.<br>
IIIb-4. Base gas measurement<br>
The CO2 concentration of the base gas obtained by the<br><br>
first detection element 25a in "IIIb-1. Preliminary base gas measurement" is compared with the CO2 concentration of the sample gas obtained by the first detection element 25a in "IIIb-2. Preliminary sample gas measurement-".  If the C02 concentration of the base gas is higher than the C02 concentration of the sample gas, the base gas is diluted with the reference gas in the gas injector 21 to a CO2 concentration level equivalent to that of the sample gas, and then the light intensity measurement is performed on the base gas thus diluted.<br>
Since the C02 concentrations of the two breath samples are adjusted to substantially the same level by dilution, the ranges of the  C02 and  C02 calibration curves to be used can be narrowed.<br>
It should be noted that the measuring procedure 2 of this embodiment is characterized in that the C02 concentrations of the two breath samples are adjusted to substantially the same level, and does not necessarily require to employ a step of maintaining the C02 concentration at a constant level as described in JPB 4(1992)-124141.  The use of limited ranges of calibration curves can be achieved simply by adjusting the CO2 concentrations of the base gas and the sample gas to substantially the same level.  Since the C02 concentrations of the base gas and the sample gas vary within a range of 1% to 5% in actual measurement, it is very troublesome to always<br><br>
maintain the C02 concentrations at a constant level.<br>
If the C02 concentration of the. base gas is lower than the CO2 concentration of the sample gas, the base gas is not diluted, and the measurement is performed on the base gas. The base gas is mechanically pushed out at a constant flow rate by the gas injector 21, and light intensity are measured by means of the detection elements 25a and 25b.<br>
The light intensity thus obtained by the first and second detection elements 25a and 25b are represented by -12B and 13B, respectively. IIIb-5. Reference measurement;<br>
The cleaning of the gas flow path and the cells and the light intensity measurement on the reference gas are performed again.<br>
The light intensity thus obtained by the first and second detection elements 25a and 25b are represented by  #2 anc5<br><br>
13R2 respectively. IIIb-6. Sample gas measurement<br>
If the base gas is diluted in "IIIb-4. Base gas measurement", the sample gas is sucked from the breath sampling bag, and then mechanically pushed out at a constant flow rate by the gas injector 21.  At this time, light intensity are measured by the detection elements 25a and 25b.<br>
If the base gas is not diluted in "IIIb-4. Base gas measurement", the sample gas is diluted with the reference gas<br><br>
to a C02 concentration level equivalent to that of the base gas in the gas injector 21, and then the intensity of light transmitted through the sample gas is measured by means of the detection elements 25a and 25b.<br>
The light intensity thus obtained by the first and second detection elements 25a and 25b are represented by 12S and 13S, respectively. IIIb-7. Reference measurement<br>
The cleaning of the gas flow path and the cells and the light intensity measurement on the reference gas are performed again.<br>
The light intensity thus obtained by the first and second detection elements 25a and 25b are represented by  Ro and<br><br>
13R3, respectively. IV. Data processing IV-1. Calculation of absnrbances for base gas<br>
Absorbances 12Abs(B) and 13Abs(B) of 12C02 and 13CO2 in the base gas are calculated on the basis of the transmitted light intensity 12R1,. 13R1/ 12R2 and 13]R2 for tne reference gas and the transmitted light intensity 12B and 13B for the base gas obtained in the measuring procedure 1 or in the measuring procedure 2.<br>
The absorbance 12Abs(B) of 12C02 is calculated from the following equation:<br>
12Abs(B)=-log[2.12B/(12R1+12R2)]<br><br>
The absorbance 13Abs(B) of  C02 is calculated from the following equation:<br>
13Abs(B)=-log[2.13B/(13R1+13R2)]<br>
Since the calculation of the absorbances is based on the light intensity obtained in the base gas measurement and the averages (12R1+12R2)/2 and (13R1+13R2)/2 of the light intensity obtained in the reference measurements performed before and after the base gas measurement, the influence of a drift (a time-related influence on the measurement) can be eliminated.  Therefore, when the apparatus is turned on, there is no need for waiting until the apparatus reaches a thermal equilibrium (it usually takes several hours).<br>
Where the measuring procedure of the base gas measurement, the reference gas measurement and the base gas measurement, and the sample gas measurement, the reference gas<br>
measurement and the sample gas measurement as describe at the<br><br>
beginning of "IIIa" is employed, the absorbance 12Abs(B) of<br>
12C02 in the base gas is calculated from the following equation:<br>
12Abs(B)=-log[(12B1+12B2)/2.12R]<br>
and the absorbance 13Abs(B) of 13C02 is calculated from the following equation:<br>
13Abs(B)=-log[(13B1+l3B2)/2.13R]<br>
wherein 12R and 13R are the transmitted light intensity for the reference gas, 12B1' and 13B1 are the transmitted light<br><br>
intensity for the base gas obtained before the reference gas measurement, and 12B2 and 13B2 are the transmitted light intensity for the base gas obtained after the reference gas measurement. IV-2. Calculation of absnrbances for sample gs.c;<br>
Absorbances 12Abs(S) and 13Abs(S) of 12C02 and 13C02 in the sample gas are calculated on the basis of the transmitted light intensity 12R2, 13R2, 12R3 and 13R3 for the reference gas and the transmitted light intensity 12S and 13S for the sample gas obtained in the measuring procedure 1 or in the measuring procedure 2.<br>
The absorbance 12Abs(S) of  CO2 is calculated from the<br>
£j<br>
following  equation:<br>
12Abs( S ) = -log[2 • 12S/(12R2+-12R3 ) ]<br>
The absorbance 13Abs(S)  of  13C02  is  calculated  from the following equation:<br>
13Abs(S)=-log[2.13S/(13R2+13R3)]<br>
Since the calculation of the absorbances is based on the light intensity obtained in the sample gas measurement and the averages of the light intensity obtained in the reference measurements performed before and after the sample gas measurement, the influence of a drift can be eliminated.<br>
Where the measuring procedure of the base gas measurement, the reference gas measurement and the base gas measurement, and the sample gas measurement, the reference .gas<br><br>
measurement  and the  sample gas measurement  as  describe  at  the<br>
beginning of   "IIIa"   is employed,   the absorbance  12Abs(S)   of<br><br>
12C02 in the sample gas is calculated from the following<br>
equation:<br>
12Abs(S)=-log[(12S1+12S2)/2.12R]<br>
and the absorbance 13Abs(S) of 13C02 is calculated from the following equation:<br>
13Abs(S)=-log[(13S1+13S2)/2.13R]<br><br>
wherein -R and -1OR are the transmitted light intensity for the<br>
reference gas, 12S1 and 13S1 are the transmitted light<br>
intensity for the sample gas obtained before the reference gas<br>
measurement, and   S2 and 13S2 are the transmitted light<br>
intensity for the sample gas obtained after the reference gas<br>
measurement.<br>
IV-3. Calculation of concentrations<br>
The  C02 concentration and the  C02 concentration are calculated by using calibration curves.<br>
The calibration curves for  C02 and   C02 are prepared on the basis of measurement performed by using gaseous samples of known  CO2 concentrations and gaseous samples of known 13C02 concentrations, respectively.<br>
For preparation of the calibration curve for 12CC&gt;2, the 12C02 absorbances for different  C02 concentrations within a range of about 0% to about 6% are measured.  The  C02 concentrations and the 12C02 absorbances are plotted as<br><br>
abscissa and ordinate, respectively, and the curve is determined by the method of least squares.  An approximate quadratic curve, which includes relatively small errors, is employed as the calibration curve in this embodiment.<br>
For preparation of the calibration curve for ^COo, the 13CO2 absorbances for different 13C02 concentrations within a<br>
range of about 0.00% to about 0.07% are measured.  The 13COo<br>
&amp;<br><br>
concentrations and the 13 C02 absorbances are plotted as abscissa and ordinate, respectively, and the curve is determined by the method of least squares.  An approximate quadratic curve, which includes relatively small errors, is<br>
employed as the calibration curve in this embodiment.<br>
Strictly speaking, the  13CO2 absorbance determined by<br>
individually measuring gases respectively containing  12CO2 and 12C02 may be different from the  13CO2 absorbance determined by measuring a gas containing both  C02 and 13C02-  This is because the wavelength filters each have a bandwidth and the<br><br>
13CO2 absorption spectrum partially overlaps  13CO2 absorption<br>
          spectrum.  Since gases containing both 12CO2 and 13 C02 are to<br>
be measured in this measurement method, the overlap of these spectra should be corrected for preparation of the calibration curves.  The calibration curves to be employed in this measurement are subjected to the correction for the overlap of the absorption spectra.<br>
For preparation of the calibration curve for the 12CO2<br><br>
concentration, the  12CO2 absorbances for 20 different  12CO2 concentrations within a range of about 0% to about 6% are measured.  The  12CO2 concentrations and the  12CO2 absorbances<br><br>
are plotted as abscissa and ordinate, respectively, as shown in Fig. 17A.<br>
The curve, which passes through the respective data points, is determined by the method of least squares.  An approximate quadratic curve includes the least error.<br>
Therefore, the approximate quadratic curve is employed as the<br><br>
calibration curve for  12CO2 in this embodiment.<br>
In turn, five data points are selected which are located<br>
 around the  12CO2 concentration of the base gas previously<br>
determined on the basis of the calibration curve for  COo. The five data points fall within a concentration range of 1.5%, which accounts for 25% of the entire concentration range (6%) of the calibration curve shown in Fig. 17A.  Then, the data within the limited concentration range are used for the preparation of a new calibration curve (see Fig. 17B).  It is confirmed that the preparation of the calibration curve within the limited data range improves the conformity of the data to the approximate curve, thereby remarkably reducing errors associated with the preparation of the calibration curve.  The C02 concentration of the base gas is determined on the basis<br>
of the absorbance 12Abs(B) of the base gas by using the new<br>
 calibration curve for  12CO2<br><br>
The  12CO2 concentration of the sample gas is determined<br>
in the same manner.<br>
For preparation of the calibration curve for the 13CO0<br>
JLt<br>
concentration, the 13C02 absorbances for 20 different 13C09<br>
^<br>
concentrations within a range of about 0.00% to about 0.07% are measured.  The  C02 concentrations and the 13C02 absorbances are plotted as abscissa and ordinate, respectively, as shown in Fig. 18A.<br>
The curve, which passes through the respective data points, is determined by the method of least squares.  An approximate quadratic curve includes the least error. Therefore, the approximate quadratic curve is employed as the<br><br>
calibration curve for  13CO2 in this embodiment.<br>
In turn, five data points are selected which are located<br>
around the   13CO2 concentration of the base gas previously<br>
1 q<br>
determined on the basis of the calibration curve for -LOC02. The five data points fall within a concentration range of 0.015%, which accounts for about 1/4 of the entire concentration range (0.07%) of the calibration curve shown in Fig. 18A.  Then, the data within the limited concentration range are used for the preparation of a new calibration curve (see Fig. 18B).  It is confirmed that the preparation of the calibration curve within the limited data range improves the conformity of the data to the approximate curve, thereby remarkably reducing errors associated with the preparation of<br><br>
the calibration curve.  The 13C02 concentration of the base gas is determined on the basis of the absorbance 13Abs(B) of the base gas by using the new calibration curve for 13CO2<br><br>
The  CO2 concentration of the sample gas is determined in the same manner.<br>
The  C02 concentration and 13C02 concentration of the base gas are represented by 12Conc(B) and 13Conc(B), respectively.  The 12C02 concentration and 13C02 concentration of the sample gas are represented by 12Conc(S) and 13Conc(S), respectively. IV-4. Calculation  of concentration ratios<br>
The concentration ratio of 13C02 to 12C02 is determined. The concentration ratios in the base gas and in the sample gas are expressed as 13Conc(B)/12Conc(B) and 13Conc(S)/12Conc(S), respectively.<br>
Alternatively, the concentration ratios in the base gas and in the sample gas may be defined as 13Conc(B)/ 12Conc(B)+13Conc(B) and 13Conc(S)/12Conc(S) + 13Conc(S),<br>
1 o<br>
respectively.  Since the  C02 concentration is much higher than the  C02 concentration, the concentration ratios expressed in the former way and in the latter way are substantially the same. iy-5a. Correction of concentration ratios<br>
As described in "BACKGROUND ART", the concentration ratios obtained in the aforesaid manner deviate from actual<br><br>
concentrations, depending on the 12CO2 concentration.<br><br>
Although the cause of the deviation has not been elucidated yet, the deviation supposedly results from changes in the spectroscopic characteristics such as reflectance, refractive index and stray light in dependence on the ^CO? concentration and from the error characteristics of the least square method employed for preparation of the calibration curves.<br>
If the concentration ratio is determined without correcting the deviation, a critical error may result. Therefore, absorbances 12Abs and 13Abs of 12C02 and 13C02 in gaseous samples -having the same concentration ratio but different 12C02 concentrations are measured, and the  CC^ and 12CO2 concentrations and  CO2 concentration ratios of the gaseous samples are determined by using the calibration curves.  Then, the 12CO2 concentrations 12Conc and the<br><br>
concentration ratios  13Conc/12  Conc are plotted as abscissa and ordinate, respectively.<br>
The result is shown in Fig. 1.<br>
The concentration ratios plotted as ordinate in the graph of Fig.l are not normalized.  The concentration ratios may be normalized for easy processing of data.  Fig. 19<br><br>
"1".  (The concentration ratios thus normalized are hereinafter referred to as "normalized concentration ratios".)<br>
To obtain an approximate curve accommodating these plotted data, the method of least squares is employed for approximation of the data.  It is experientially known that a function of the fourth degree expressed by the following equation (1) provides the most accurate approximate curve.<br>
F(x) = ax4 + bx3 + ex2 + dx + e 	(1)<br>
wherein F is a normalized concentration ratio, a to d are<br><br>
coefficients, e is a constant, and x is a  12CO2 concentration. Therefore, the fourth-order function (1) is used as a correction equation.  Alternatively, a spline function may be used.<br>
Standardized 13CO2/  12CO2 concentration ratios are calculated from the correction equation (1) on the basis of the 12C02 concentrations 12Conc(B) and 1 Conc(S) in the breath samples of the patient.  Then, the concentration ratios 13Conc(B)/12Conc(B) and 13Conc(S)/12Conc(S) of the base gas and the sample gas obtained in the measurement are respectively divided by the normalized concentration ratios calculated from the correction equation (1).  Thus, corrected concentration ratios are obtained as follows: Corrected concentration ratio =13Conc(B)/[12Conc(B)•F(12Conc(B))]<br><br>
Corrected concentration ratio =13Conc(S)/[12Conc(S).F(12Conc(S))] IV-5b. Correction of concentration rating<br>
The  C02 concentration ratios of the base gas and the sample gas are subjected to a correction for oxygen<br>
concentration according to the present invention.<br>
The  13CO2 concentration ratios are corrected by using a<br>
graph (Fig. 2) in which measurements of the 13CO2 concentration ratio are plotted with respect to the oxygen<br>
contents of gaseous samples.<br>
 More specifically, normalized  13CO2 concentration<br>
ratios are obtained from the graph shown in Fig. 2 on the<br>
basis of the concentrations of oxygen in the breath samples<br>
which are measured by means of the O2 sensor.  Then, the  13CO2<br>
concentration ratios of the base gas and the sample gas are respectively divided by. the normalized  13CO2 concentration ratios.  Thus, the  13CO2 concentration ratios corrected depending on the oxygen concentrations can be obtained. IV-6. Dp-termination of change in 13C<br>
A difference in 13C between the sample gas and the base gas is calculated from the following equation: Δ13C = [Concentration ratio of sample gas - Concentration<br><br>
ratio of base gas] x 10-3 / [Concentration ratio of base gas] (Unit: per mill) V. Modification <br><br>
The present invention is not limited to the embodiment<br>
described above.  In the above-mentioned embodiment, the ^<br>
and  13C02 concentrations of the base gas and the sample gas<br>
are determined, then the concentration ratios thereof are calculated, and the concentration ratios are subjected to the oxygen concentration correction.  Alternatively, the concentration ratios may be determined after the 12C02 and<br><br>
13C02 concentrations of the base gas and the sample gas are determined and the 12C02 and 13C02 concentrations are corrected by way of the oxygen concentration correction. VI. Experiments VI-1.<br>
The absorbances of gaseous samples respectively containing 12C02 in concentrations 12Conc of 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5% and 6% with a concentration ratio 13Conc/l2Conc of 1.077% were measured in accordance with the method for<br>
1 9<br>
spectrometrically measuring an isotopic gas.  The  C02 concentrations 12Conc and 13C02 concentrations 13Conc of the gaseous samples were determined on the basis of the measured<br><br>
absorbances by using the calibration curves.  The  12C02 concentrations 12Cone and the concentration ratios 13Conc/12Conc were plotted as abscissa and ordinate, respectively, as shown in Fig. 20.<br>
The maximum and minimum values of the concentration ratios 13Conc/12Conc were 1.083% and 1.076%, respectively, and<br><br>
the difference therebetween was 0.007%.<br>
In turn, the concentration ratios 13Conc/12Conc were corrected by using the correction equation (1), thus providing a less undulant curve as shown in Fig. 21.  In Fig. 21, the maximum and minimum values of the concentration ratios 13Conc/12Conc were 1.078% and 1.076%, respectively, and the difference therebetween was 0.0015%.<br>
Therefore, the correction with the correction equation (1) remarkably reduced the variation in the concentration ratio 13Conc/12Conc. VI-2.<br>
The absorbances of gaseous samples respectively containing 12C02 in concentrations 12Conc of 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5% and 6% with a concentration ratio 13Conc/12Conc of 1.065%<br>
were measured in accordance with the method for<br>
i 9 spectrometrically measuring an isotopic gas.  The ^Conc and<br>
the 13Conc were determined on the basis of the measured absorbances by using the calibration curves shown in Figs. 17A<br>
and 18A.  The 12CO2 concentrations 12Conc and the<br>
 	,<br>
concentration ratios 13Conc/12Conc were plotted as abscissa and ordinate, respectively, as shown in Fig. 22.<br>
The maximum and minimum values of the concentration ratios 13Conc/12Conc were 1.077% and 1.057%, respectively, and the difference therebetween was 0.02%.<br>
In turn, concentration ratios 13Conc/  Conc were<br><br>
determined by using the calibration curves shown in Figs. 17A and 18A and then using the limited-range calibration curves shown in Figs. 17B and 18B, thus providing a less undulant curve as shown in Fig. 23.  In Fig. 23, the maximum and minimum values of the concentration ratios 13Conc/12Conc were 1.066% and 1.064%, respectively, and the difference therebetween was 0.002%.<br>
Therefore, the method of the present invention, in which the calibration curves were produced again, remarkably reduced the variation in the concentration ratio 13Conc/12Conc. VI-3.<br>
The absorbances of gaseous samples having different known 13CO2 concentration ratios and containing various concentration of oxygen (up to 90%) were measured, and then the  13CO2 concentration ratios were determined on the basis of<br>
the measured absorbances by using the calibration curves.<br>
 Further, the  13CO2 concentration ratios thus determined were<br>
corrected by using a correction line as shown in Fig. 2. The actual 13CO2 concentration ratios and the ^CC&gt;2 concentration ratios thus corrected were normalized, and plotted as abscissa and ordinate, respectively, as shown in Fig. 24.<br><br>
In Fig.   24,   the relationship between the actual      13CO2<br><br>
concentration ratio and the measured  13CO2 concentration ratio is about 1:1 (or the scope of the fitting curve in Fig. 24 is<br><br>
about 1).  In comparison with the prior art shown in Fig. 4, in. which the relationship between the actual 13CO2<br><br>
concentration ratio and the measured 13C02 concentration ratio is about 1:0.3 (or the scope of the fitting curve is about 0.3), the measurement accuracy was drastically improved by<br>
performing the correction.<br>
Thus, the correction using the correction line remarkably<br>
improved the accuracy of the measurement of the 13C02<br>
concentration ratio.<br>
VI-4.<br><br>
The  12CO2 concentration of the same sample gas containing carbon dioxide was measured a plurality of times by means of the apparatus for spectrometrically measuring an isotopic gas.<br>
After one hour warming-up of apparatus, a measuring procedure consisting of the reference gas measurement, the sample gas measurement, the reference gas measurement, the sample gas measurement and the reference gas measurement were<br>
 performed ten times on the same sample gas.  The   12CO2<br>
concentration was determined in each cycle of the measuring<br>
procedure in accordance with the method A of the present<br><br>
invention in which the absorbance of 12CO2 in the sample gas was determined on the basis of an average of values obtained in the reference gas measurements performed before and after the sample gas measurement, and in accordance with the prior<br><br>
art method B in which the absorbance of  12CO2 in the sample<br><br>
gas was determined on the basis of a value obtained in the reference measurement only before the sample gas measurement, The results of the calculation of the concentrations in accordance with the method A are shown in Table 1.  In Table 1, the concentrations obtained in the second and subsequent measurements were normalized by regarding a concentration obtained in the first measurement as "1".  The standard deviation of the concentration data calculated in accordance the method A was 0.0009.<br>
Table 1<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
The results of the calculation of the concentrations in accordance with the method B are shown in Table 2.  In Table ;!, the concentrations obtained in the second and subsequent ^feasurements were normalized by regarding a concentration obtained in the first measurement as' "1".  The standard deviation of the concentration data calculated in accordance with the method B was 0.0013.<br>
Table 2<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
As can be understood from the foregoing, the method of the present invention, in which the absorbances are determined on the basis of the light intensity measured on the sample gas and an average of the light intensity measured on the reference gas, provides concentration data with little variation.<br><br><br><br><br>
