				<td>BODY FLUID ABSORBENT PANEL<br>
This invention relates to a body fluid absorbent panel<br>
suitable for use in a disposable body fluid absorbent wearing<br>
article such as a diaper or a sanitary napkin.<br>
In conventional disposable diapers or sanitary napkins,<br>
it is well known to use, as a body fluid absorbent panel thereof,<br>
an assembly comprising a body fluid absorbent core formed by<br>
a mixture of hydrophilic fibers such as fluff pulp and high<br>
absorption polymer particles and covered with a liquid-pervious<br>
sheet or with such liquid-pervious sheet and a liquid-<br>
impervious sheet.<br>
It is always desired for such a disposable body fluid<br>
absorbent wearing article such as a diaper or a sanitary napkin<br>
to improve a liquid absorbing capacity achieved by the article<br>
and, at the same time, to minimize its thickness. The<br>
requirements may be satisfied by increasing the quantity of high<br>
absorption polymer particles. However, the high absorption<br>
polymer particles have not the absorption rate as high as that<br>
achieved by the fluff pulp. In addition, it becomes difficult<br>
to maintain the polymer in a constant shape and possibility that<br>
the polymer may leak out from the article as its quantity<br>
increases since the polymer is present in the form of particles .<br><br>
Upon moisture absorption, the high absorption polymer particles<br>
form a gel block which can no more absorb further quantity of moisture and, in consequence, the article often can not achieve<br>
the absorption expected on the basis of the quantity of the high<br>
absorption polymer particles used by the article.<br>
In view of the problem raised when a large quantity of<br>
the high absorption polymer particles are used, it is an object<br>
of this invention to provide a body fluid absorbent panel<br>
improved so that the problems can be overcome.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a body fluid<br>
absorbent panel comprising:<br>
a liquid-pervious first sheet;<br>
a liquid-impervious second sheet; and<br>
a core disposed between said first and second sheets,<br>
wherein:<br>
said core is composed of heat-fusible fibers such as<br>
herein described and super absorbent polymer particles such as<br>
herein described,<br>
said heat-fusible fibers comprise at least two types of<br>
fibers having melting points different from each other and form<br>
a three dimensional network structure such that said heat-<br>
fusible fibers intersecting one another are fused together at<br><br>
some of points of intersection, and<br>
said super absorbent polymer particles are held in said<br>
network structure or are bonded to said heat-fusible fibers by<br>
means of a binder such as herein described.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Fig. 1 is a plan view showing a disposable diaper as <br>
partially broken away;	<br>
Fig. 2 is a sectional view taken along a line II - II in<br>
Fig. 1; and<br>
Fig. 3 is a fragmentary scale-enlarged diagram of Fig.<br>
2.<br>
Details of a body fluid absorbent panel according to this<br>
invention will be more fully understood from the description<br>
given hereunder with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
Fig. 1 is a plan view showing a disposable diaper 1 using<br>
a body fluid absorbent panel according to this invention as<br>
partially broken away. The diaper 1 comprises a liquid-<br>
pervious topsheet 2 made of a nonwoven fabric or a perforate<br>
plastic film, a liquid-impervious backsheet 3 made of a plastic<br>
film and a body fluid absorbent panel 4 disposed between these<br>
two sheets 2, 3. The top- and backsheets 2, 3 extend outward<br><br>
beyond a peripheral edge of the panel 4 and are placed upon and<br>
water-tightly bonded to each other in these extensions by means<br>
of hot melt adhesive 9 describing a plurality of spiral curves.<br>
The diaper 1 is composed, in a longitudinal direction as viewed<br>
in Fig. 1, of a front waist region 6, a rear waist region 7 and<br>
a crotch region 8 extending between these two regions 6, 7 and<br>
along longitudinally outer end portions of the front and rear<br>
waist regions 6, 7, respectively, elastic members 11, 12<br>
extending in a waist surrounding direction, i.e., in a<br>
transverse direction as viewed in Fig. 1 are disposed between<br>
the top- and backsheets 2, 3 and bonded under tension to the<br>
inner surface of at least one of these sheets 2, 3. Along<br>
transversely opposite side edge portions of the crotch region<br>
8, elastic members 13 associated with respective leg-openings<br>
are disposed between the top- and backsheets 2, 3 and bonded<br>
under tension to the inner surface of at least one of these sheets<br>
2,3. A pair of tape fasteners 14 are attached to transversely<br>
opposite side edge portions of the rear waist region 7. The<br>
inner surface of the crotch region 8 is formed in its<br>
transversely middle zone with a pair of compressed grooves 16<br>
extending in the longitudinal direction.<br>
Fig. 2 is a sectional view taken along a line II - II in<br>
Fig. 1. The panel 4 has a core 21 and a cover sheet 26 (See<br><br>
Fig. 1 also) adapted to cover upper and lower surfaces 22, 23<br>
as well as side surfaces 24 of the core 21. The core 21 comprises<br>
a plurality of fibers 2 7 and high absorption polymer particles<br>
28 mixed with the fibers 27 wherein its upper surface 22 faces<br>
the topsheet 2 with the cover sheet 2 6 therebetween and its lower<br>
surface 23 faces the backsheet 3 with the cover sheet 26<br>
therebetween. The core 21 may have its upper surface 22 covered<br>
with a liquid-pervious sheet and its lower surface 23 as well<br>
as its side surfaces 24 covered with a liquid-pervious or<br>
liquid-impervious sheet. In the case of the illustrated<br>
embodiment, these surfaces 21 - 24 are covered with the<br>
liquid-pervious cover sheet 26 in the form of tissue paper. Such<br>
cover sheet 26 is bonded to the backsheet 3 by means of hot melt<br>
adhesive 9 and bonded to the topsheet 2 by means of hot melt<br>
adhesive 29. By bonding the cover sheet 26 to the top- and<br>
backsheets 2,3, the panel 4 is held in place and, in addition,<br>
the panel 4 is brought in close contact with the topsheet 2 so<br>
that body fluids may rapidly permeate the panel 4. The panel<br>
4 is formed in its transversely opposite side portions with a<br>
pair of the compressed grooves 16 extending in the longitudinal<br>
direction. These compressed grooves 16 may be formed by<br>
compressing the panel 4 together with the top- and backsheet<br>
2, 3 in a thickness direction thereof at a normal temperature<br><br>
or under heating until the panel 4 has a thickness along these<br>
grooves reduced to 2/3 or less, preferably to 1/2 or less with<br>
respect to the remaining region of the panel 4 . While the length<br>
of these compressed grooves 16 in the longitudinal direction<br>
is not specified, these compressed grooves 16 preferably extend<br>
across the crotch region 8 over at least 1/2 of a full length<br>
of the panel 4. While a width of the respective grooves 16 at<br>
bottoms 32 thereof also is not specified, this 'width is<br>
preferably in a range of 0.2 ~ 5 mm. The panel 4 presents the<br>
maximum apparent density at the bottoms 32 of the respective<br>
grooves 16 at which the fibers 27 and the polymer particles 28<br>
are compressed and a relatively high density in the vicinity<br>
of both sides 33 of the respective bottoms 32. The density of<br>
the panel 4 progressively decreases substantially in proportion<br>
to the distance from the respective grooves 16 in the transverse<br>
direction of the panel 4.<br>
Fig. 3 is a fragmentary scale-enlarged diagram<br>
illustrating the core 21. The core 21 is a mixture of the fibers<br>
27 occupying 40 - 5 % by weight of the core 21 and the high<br>
absorption polymer particles 28 wherein the fibers 27 have a<br>
basis weight of 20 ~ 100 g/m2 and an apparent density in a range<br>
of 0.01 - 0.05 g/cm3. Of the entire quantity of these fibers<br>
27, at least 50 % by weight comprises fibers having a fineness<br><br>
less than 6 dtex and 80 - 100% by weight comprises hydrophilic<br>
fibers. The fibers 27 may contain hydrophobic fibers of 20 ~<br>
0 % by weight. Of the entire quantity of these fibers 27, 2 0<br>
- 100% by weight comprises heat-fusible fibers which may be<br>
hydrophilic or hydrophobic . The fibers 27 may comprise at least<br>
two types of fiber having melting points different from each<br>
other and preferably comprise two or three types of fiber<br>
presenting a differential melting point at least in a range of.<br>
50 °C . It is also possible to use crimped or non-crimped<br>
side-by-side or sheath-and-core type composite fibers as the<br>
fibers 27.<br>
In the case of the core 21 exemplarily illustrated in Fig.<br>
3, the fibers 27 comprise low melting point (i.e., 130°C)<br>
polyethylene fibers 41 having a fineness of 2 dtex and treated<br>
to become hydrophilic and high melting point (i.e., 250 °C)<br>
polyester fibers 42 having a fineness of 4 dtex and treated to<br>
become hydrophilic. The low melting point fibers 41 occupy 70 %<br>
by weight and the high melting point fibers 42 occupy 30 % by<br>
weight of the entire quantity of the fibers 27. At first spots<br>
43 at which the low melting point fibers 41 intersect one another,<br>
the low melting point fibers 41 are fused together and at second<br>
spots 44 at which the low melting point fibers 41 intersect the<br>
high melting point fibers 42, only the low melting point fibers<br><br>
41 are molten and welded to the high melting point fibers 42.<br>
At third spots 46 at which the high melting point fibers 42<br>
intersect together, these fibers 42 merely come in contact with<br>
one another but not welded together. At the first intersecting<br>
spots 43, the low melting point fibers 41 are rather firmly fused<br>
together, at the second intersecting spots 44, the low melting<br>
point fibers 41 are welded to the high melting point fibere 42<br>
rather moderately and at the third intersecting spots 46, the<br>
high melting point fibers 42 are not welded together. Within<br>
the core 21, the superabsorbent polymer particles 28 may be held<br>
in a network structure defined by the fibers 27 in various<br>
manners. For example, the polymer particles 28 may be held<br>
between each pair of the adjacent low melting point fibers 41,<br>
41, between each pair of the adjacent low melting point fiber<br>
41 and high melting point fiber 42 or between each pair of the<br>
adjacent high melting point fibers 42, 42 so far as the polymer<br>
particles 28 can be held apart from one another. In addition<br>
to these manners in which the polymer particles 28 are held by<br>
the fibers 27, it is also possible to use the well known binder<br>
such as ethylene-glycidyl methacrylate copolymer <br>
by means of which the polymer particles 28 are bonded to the<br>
fibers 27 comprising the low melting point fibers 41 and the<br>
high melting point fibers 42. While the well known polymer<br>
particles 28 may be used, those having a grain size of 100 -<br><br>
1000 µ and a saline retention capacity of at least 20 g/g is<br>
preferably used. 20 - 100 % by weight of the polymer particles<br>
28 preferably presents an absorption rate less than 20 seconds,<br>
more preferably presents an absorption rate less than 10 seconds<br>
as measured by Vortex method according to JIS K 7224. While<br>
the spherical polymer particles 28 are illustrated, preferably<br>
the surface of the individual polymer particles 28 is formed<br>
with a plurality of irregularities and thereby the surface area<br>
thereof is maximized so far as the total weight of the polymer<br>
particles 28 is maintained constant. The irregularities<br>
formed on the spherical surface of the individual polymer<br>
particles 28 facilitate the polymer particles 28 to be caught<br>
by the fibers 2 7 and thereby eliminate an anxiety that the<br>
polymer particles 28 might fall off from the core 21. The<br>
surface area of the individual polymer particles 28 enlarged<br>
by the irregularities serves to improve the absorption rate.<br>
A specific surface area of the polymer particles 28 functioning<br>
in this manner is preferably at least 0.03 m2/g, more preferably<br>
at least 0.07 m2/g as measured using AUTOPORE III9420 of<br>
Micrometrics Corp.<br>
In such diaper 1, the quantity of water having permeated<br>
through the topsheet 2 and the cover sheet 26 into the core 21<br>
is absorbed not only by the hydrophilic fibers contained in the<br><br>
fibers 27 but also by the high absorption polymer particles 28<br>
as this quantity of water flows through the interstices of the<br>
fibers 27 forming the network structure. Of the polymer<br>
particles 28, those held between respective pairs of the<br>
adjacent low melting point fibers 41 and high melting point<br>
fibers 42 are swollen and deformed as they absorb water. The<br>
polymer particles 28 swollen and deformed in this mariner<br>
separate the fibers 41, 42 one from another at the second spots<br>
44 and are relieved of the constraining effect by these fibers<br>
41, 42. Now the polymer particles 28 can further quantity of<br>
water. A plurality of polymer particles 28 are held by the<br>
fibers 27 so that the individual polymer particles 28 may be<br>
spaced one from another. Such arrangement eliminates an<br>
apprehension that these polymer particles 28 might mutually<br>
prevent them from being swollen and form the gel block retarding<br>
permeation of water into the core 21. When at least 20 % by<br>
weight of the polymer particles 28 has the absorption rate less<br>
than 2 0 seconds as measured by the Vortex method, the quantity<br>
of water flowing through the interstices of the fibers 27 can<br>
be rapidly caught by the polymer particles 28 and any<br>
possibility that any quantity of such water might leak out from<br>
the diaper 1. Conventionally, the polymer particles 28 have<br>
sometimes fallen off from the core 21 as the diaper 1 is handled.<br><br>
However, with the arrangement in which the polymer particles<br>
28 move sideways before falling off thereof, the presence of<br>
the compressed grooves 16 function to prevent such movement of<br>
the polymer particles 28 and thereby to eliminate a possibility<br>
that the polymer particles 28 might leak out from the lateral<br>
portions of the panel 4.<br>
The compressed grooves 16 serve also to dam up sideway<br>
flow of water in the core 21 and thereby to prevent water from<br>
leaking sideways in the diaper 1. Placement as well as length<br>
of the compressed grooves 16 are not limited to those in the<br>
illustrated embodiment and may be appropriately modified. It<br>
is even possible without departing from the scope of this<br>
invention to provide the panel 4 having none of the compressed<br>
grooves 16. It is also possible to replace the compressed<br>
grooves 16 each continuously extending in the longitudinal<br>
direction as in the illustrated embodiment by a plurality of<br>
longitudinally intermittent but substantially ribbon-like<br>
compressed regions. The compressed grooves 16 formed by<br>
compressing the panel 4 together with the top- and backsheets<br>
2, 3 as in the illustrated embodiment may be replaced by the<br>
compressed grooves 16 formed by compressing the panel 4 alone.<br>
The compressed grooves 16 obtained by compressing the core 21<br>
under heating is advantageous in that the fibers 27 are fused<br><br>
together at the bottoms 32 and in the vicinity 33 thereof of<br>
the respective grooves 16. As a result, sideway movement of<br>
the polymer particles 28 and water can be reliably prevented.<br>
The panel 4 according to this invention can be used not<br>
only for the diaper 1 as illustrated but also the other<br>
disposable body fluid absorbent wearing articles such as a<br>
sanitary napkin. In these articles, the cover sheet 2 6 may be<br>
formed, instead of the tissue paper, with the liquid-pervious<br>
topsheet 2 (See Fig. 1) and the liquid-impervious backsheet 3.<br>
In this case, the upper surface 22 and the lower surface 23 of<br>
the panel 4 are covered with the topsheet 2 and the backsheet<br>
3 , respectively. The absorption rate measured by Vortex method<br>
is represented by a time required for the high absorption<br>
polymer particles of 2.0 g to absorb 50 g of 0.9 % physiological<br>
saline solution. The water retention of the high absorption<br>
polymer particles 28 is represented by a weight of the particles<br>
28 of 1 g after the particles 28 have been immersed in 1 liter<br>
of 0.9 % physiological saline solution for 1 hour, then<br>
water-drained for 15 minutes and finally centrifuged at 85 0 rpm<br>
for 9 0 seconds.<br>
The body fluid absorbent panel according to this<br>
invention is constructed so that the high absorption polymer<br>
particles are held apart from one another within the core of<br><br>
network structure formed by the heat-fusible fibers. Such a<br>
unique arrangement enables the problem accompanied by the prior<br>
art such that the polymer particles might leak out from the panel<br>
to be solved. The polymer particles in such state are free from<br>
an apprehension that the gel block might be formed and<br>
deteriorate the absorption efficiency of the panel. Such panel<br>
enables a large quantity of the high absorption polymer<br>
particles to be effectively used and to offer the absorption<br>
efficiency expected on the basis of the quantity of the polymer<br>
particles actually used.<br><br>
