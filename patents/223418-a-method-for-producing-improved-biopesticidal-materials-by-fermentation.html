				<td>A METHOD FOR PRODUCING IMPROVED BIOPESTICIDAL MATERIALS<br>
BY FERMENTATION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention is directed to a method for producing a new nematocidal<br>
composition particularly useful against plant parasitic nematodes and also a process to<br>
prevent damage resulting from nematode infestation. The method for production of the<br>
composition involves heating a pH-adjusted fermentation broth of microorganisms to a<br>
temperature of at least about 100°C for at least about 15 minutes.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Plant parasitic nematodes cause serious economic damage to many agricultural<br>
crops around the world. The nematodes in this group are microscopic worms and are, in<br>
general, obligate parasites of plants. They feed mostly on the roots of host plants;<br>
however, several genera are known to parasitize above-ground parts including stems,<br>
leaves and flowers as well. Almost all the plant species of economic importance are<br>
susceptible to infection by some species of nematodes (notable exceptions are in the<br>
marigolds and asparagus). For example, root knot nematodes (RKN), (Meloidogyne spp.)<br>
are capable of parasitizing more than 3,000 species of crop plants. These plants include<br>
agronomic crops, vegetables, fruits, flowering trees and shrubs. Nematodes reportedly<br>
cause crop loss equivalent to more than six billion dollars in the United States alone and<br>
more than one hundred billion dollars around the world.<br>
The symptoms due to parasitic nematode injury vary widely depending on the<br>
plant host, the nematode species, age of the plant, geographical location and climatic and<br>
external environmental conditions. In general, an overall patchy appearance of plants in a<br>
Considered indicative of nematode infestation. More specifically, nematode injury<br>
; of the roots (abnormal swelling in the tissue due to rapid multiplication<br>
of cells in the cortical region) caused by species of root knot (Meloidogyne spp.)<br>
and cyst (Heterodera spp.) nematodes, lesions (localized, discolored areas) caused by<br>
lesion nematodes (Pratylenchus spp.), suppression of cell division resulting in stubby<br>
roots (Trichodorus spp.), growth abnormalities including crinkling or twisting of above-<br>
ground parts (Aphelenchoides spp.), and even cell necrosis (death) in some cases. Plant<br>
parasitic nematodes may be endoparasitic in nature, as in the case of the root-knot and<br>
lesion nematodes, or ectoparasitic as in the dagger nematode (Xiphinema spp.) and lance<br>
nematode (Hoplolaimus spp.). Nematodes can be vectors of plant viruses and are also i<br>
known to induce disease complexes predisposing plants to infection by other plant *<br>
pathogenic fungi and bacteria.<br>
Chemical nematocides, either soil fumigants or non-fumigants, have been in use<br>
for many years and are among the few feasible options for countering nematodes. At<br>
present, the process involves repeated applications of synthetic chemicals to the ground<br>
prior to planting the crop. These chemicals are extremely toxic to organisms besides<br>
nematodes and many of them may pose serious threats to the environment. With the<br>
renewed emphasis on clean water and air by environmental groups and governmental<br>
agencies, and the detection of many of these active ingredients or the metabolites thereof<br>
in ground water and several non-target organisms, there has been serious concern as to<br>
the manufacture and/or use of these chemicals. One of the most effective, economical,<br>
and widely used nematocides, DBCP (l,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane), found in ground<br>
water has been judged to induce male sterility and possible carcinogenesis. Another<br>
widely used chemical, EDB (ethylene dibromide), has also been found in ground water.<br>
Yet another very common insecticide-nematocide, aldicarb (2-methyl-2-(methylthio)-<br>
propionaldehyde-O-(methylcarbamoyl)oxime), has been found to be acutely toxic.<br>
Aldicarb has been found in ground water in several regions of United States. Carbofuran<br>
(2,3-dihydro-2,2-dimethyl-7-benzofuranyl methylcarbamate) and 1, 3-D (1,3-<br>
dichlorpropane), two very commonly used nematocides, are under special review by EPA<br>
because of their avian toxicity and possible carcinogenic effects. More recently, the<br>
decision by EPA to limit and eventually discontinue the use of the soil fumigant, methyl<br>
bromide, for agricultural purposes presents a threat to the efficiency and quality of<br>
agricultural production in the United States.<br>
Natural isolates such as N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, which may be derived from<br>
microorganisms which are the waste products of industrial fermentation processes, have '<br>
been disclosed as nematocidal in U.S. Patent No. 5,057,141.<br>
Biopesticides have been developed as an alternative to chemical pesticides. They<br>
are obtained by fermentation and can be used either as crude biomass or purified.<br>
Typically, fermentations are carried out at temperatures in the range of 20 - 40°C. For<br>
example, submerged fermentation at 28-30°C of Paecilomyces funosoroues fungal<br>
isolate ATCC No. 20874 produces fungal biomass for control of nematode infestation as ,<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,360,607; whole fermentation broth from fermentation at<br>
28°C of Streptomyces thermoarchaensis NCIB 12015 is disclosed as nematocidal in U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,182,207; fermentation broth obtained from fermentation of Streptomyces<br>
cyaneogriseus noncyanogenus NRRL 15773 at 28°C is effective against nematodes as<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,439,934; and fermentation broth obtained by fermentation<br>
of the fungus Myrothecium verrucaria at temperatures of from 25 to 30°C is disclosed as<br>
nematocidal in U.S. Patent No. 5,051,255.<br>
Heating of an infested biomass, as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,229,442, at a<br>
temperature of at least 125°C with water in an amount ranging from 1-5 times the dry <br>
weight of the biomass, may combat nematodes.<br>
However, there is still a need for the development of new and effective<br>
nematocides. It is therefore an object of this invention to provide a method for the<br>
production of nematocidal compositions which are effective and inexpensive.<br>
Brief Summary of the Invention<br>

fermentation broths of microorganisms by heating a fermentation broth to a temperature<br>
of at least about 100°C after adjusting the pH to about pH 2 or below, or about pH 8 or<br>

herbicides, antimicrobials, fungicides, insecticides, plant growth regulators or nutrients<br>
may be added to the heat-treated, pH adjusted compositions.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
To produce a nematocidal preparation, a substantial amount of biomass is prepared<br>
by submerged fermentation of a bacterium or fungal microorganism. Preferred examples<br>
of microorganisms include Baccillus spp., Myrothecium spp., Gibberella spp.,<br>
Streptomyces spp., and Fusarium spp. More preferred are the Myrothecium spp. and the<br>
Bacillus spp.<br>
More specifically, the composition can be obtained from Gibber ella fujikuroi<br>
(ATCC 12616 or 14164), Streptomyces erythraeus (also known as Saccharopolyspora<br>
erythraea, ATCC 11635 or 31772), Bacillus sphaericus (ATCC 4978), Bacillus<br>
thuringiensis such as Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (ATCC 35646), Bacillus<br>
thuringiensis kurstaki (ATCC 33679) and Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner (ATCC 19268)<br>
and Fusarium moniliforme (ATCC 10052). The composition can be obtained from any<br>
bacterium or fungal microorganism, since the method breaks down the cell wall of the<br>
microorganism. It is believed that the cell walls of microorganisms (branched<br>
polysaccharides) are partially or completely hydrolyzed under the conditions described<br>
herein, resulting in the formation of nematocidal hydrolysis products. Therefore, the<br>
method is not microorganism-specific.<br>
The bacterium or fungal microorganism is suspended or dissolved in an aqueous<br>
solution, preferably water, and is hydrolyzed by acidification to a pH below about pH 2.0<br>
by means of a biologically acceptable acid such as, for example, sulfuric, hydrochloric or<br>
phosphoric acid, or organic acids such as acetic or formic acid, and heated at a<br>
temperature of at least about 100°C for <br>
a period of at least about fifteen minutes. The material that is treated in this manner is<br>
preferentially the water-insoluble portion of the biomass from the fermentation, and the<br>
insoluble material may be separated from the water-soluble portion of the fermentation<br>
product, but separation is not necessary. The entire fermentation broth produced in the<br>
fermentor may be treated by the process of this invention. After the mixture has been<br>
acidified and heated, it will often be appropriate. to readjust the pH of the mixture to a<br>
more neutral pH to enhance safety of handling and to reduce the risk of damage to plants<br>
which would be treated with the preparation. Said pH adjustment may be carried out by<br>
addition of any biologically-acceptable alkali or base, such as sodium hydroxide,<br>
potassium hydroxide, magnesium oxide, magnesium hydroxide, calcium oxide, calcium<br>
hydroxide, or ammonia solution (ammonium hydroxide).<br>
Alternatively, the treatment can also be achieved by raising the pH to above about<br>
pH 8 by means of alkalization with biologically-acceptable alkali or base such as, for<br>
example, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, magnesium oxide, magnesium<br>
hydroxide, calcium oxide, calcium hydroxide, or ammonia solution (ammonium<br>
hydroxide), then heating the resulting mixture as above. Again, after heating, it may be<br>
appropriate to adjust the pH of the resulting mixture to a more neutral pH by means of a<br>
biologically acceptable acid such as, for example, sulfuric, hydrochloric or phosphoric<br>
acid, or organic acids such as acetic or formic acid.<br>
The heating step may be performed at a pressure above atmospheric pressure, if<br>
necessary. For example, elevated pressure may be achieved by heating within an<br>
autoclave.<br>
The product thus produced is used to protect plants or control the growth of<br>
nematodes by applying it in solid form or as a suspension in aqueous solution, preferably<br>
water, directly to the surface or the root zone of the soil in which the plants are grown.<br>
An advantage of the method which we have discovered is that the nematocidal<br>
composition is inexpensive and safe. The materials employed in the process include the<br>
fermentation broth, comprising the water-insoluble solids contained in such broth, which<br>
may be waste solids from any industrial fermentation process, such as a fermentation<br>
carried out to prepare pharmaceutical or agricultural products, or foods or beverages, and<br>
ordinary acids and bases. Previously employed industrial processes for production of<br>
nematocidal preparations are chemical syntheses which use dangerous and toxic starting<br>
materials and result in waste streams of high toxicity which must be disposed of.<br>
The method involves a post-treatment of a fermentation material, which can be<br>
industrial fermentation waste, to produce a nematocidal composition.<br>
As used herein the terms "nematocide" or "nematocidal", and the phrases "prevent<br>
plant damage" and "control of growth", with respect to nematodes, include not only the<br>
rapid, direct killing of nematodes, but also the concept of repelling nematodes, the<br>
prevention or effective control of their multiplication or reproduction, the prevention of<br>
nematode egg hatching, and confusing or immobilizing the nematodes so that they are<br>
prevented from finding a mate or a plant to parasitize.<br>
The methods of using the compositions of this invention for nematode control are by<br>
application to any field, fruit, vegetable, floral or ornamental crop or nursery crop that is<br>
sensitive to attack by plant parasitic nematodes, particularly the Meloidogyne species.<br>
Methods of application are well-known in the art and include direct application to the<br>
soil, either as a liquid or a dried solid, controlled release of the bioactive components<br>
from solid formulations into the surrounding soil, application to the plant roots directly<br>
before planting in the soil, foliar application and the like.<br>
The term "soil", used herein is intended to include all media capable of supporting<br>
the growth of plants and may include humus, sand, silt, loam, manure, compost and<br>
commercial potting mixtures among others.<br>
The term "fermentor", as used herein refers to apparatus used for various types of<br>
fermentation methods including, but not limited to, shaken culture, solid-state, continuous<br>
and batch fed methods that are contemplated for production of the fermentation broths of<br>
this invention in both laboratory and large scale fermentation processes.<br>
The term "biologically acceptable acid", as used herein refers to acids such as<br>
sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, hydrochloric acid, acetic acid or formic acid.<br>
The term "biologically acceptable alkali or base", as used herein refers to bases such<br>
as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, magnesium oxide, magnesium hydroxide,<br>
calcium oxide, calcium hydroxide or ammonium hydroxide.<br>
The process of this invention may utilize various media for the initial culture growth<br>
and can consist of potato-dextrose agar, hay infusion agar, corn meal agar, leaf litter agar,<br>
PCNB agar, soil infusion (modified), or Yeast Malt Agar as are defined in the Manual of<br>
Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology. Demain and Solomon, American Society of<br>
Microbiology, Washington, D.C., 1986.<br>
According to one embodiment of this invention, fermentation is carried out in shake-<br>
flasks or in stationary-vat fermentors. In shake-flasks, aeration is provided by agitation<br>
of the flask which causes mixing of the medium with air. In the stationary fermentors,<br>
agitation is provided by impeller means such as a disc turbine, vaned disc, open turbine,<br>
or marine propeller; and aeration is accomplished by injecting air or oxygen into the<br>
fermentation mixture.<br>
The fermentation medium consists of suitable sources of carbon, nitrogen, inorganic<br>
salts, and growth factors assimilable by the microorganism. Suitable examples of carbon<br>
sources are various sugars such as dextrose, glucose, lactose, and maltose, starch, dextrin,<br>
com meal and glycerol.<br>
The sources of nitrogen can be of organic, inorganic or mixed organic/inorganic<br>
origin. Examples of nitrogen sources that can be used in the culture medium are soybean<br>
meal, com steep liquor, peanut meal, cottonseed meal, com germ meal, fish meal, lard<br>
water, and various ammonium salts.<br>
The inclusion of certain amounts of minerals and growth factors in the fermentation<br>
medium is also helpful. Crude medium ingredients such as distillers' solubles, com steep<br>
liquor, fish meal, yeast products, peptonized milk and whey contain not only minerals but<br>
growth factors. However, inorganic salts such as potassium phosphate, sodium chloride,<br>
ferric sulfate, calcium carbonate, cobalt chloride, magnesium sulfate, and zinc sulfate can<br>
be added to the fermentation medium.<br>
Solid materials, such as calcium carbonate may be added in this process, to help with<br>
pH control, which sometimes favors particular types of pellet formation for best results.<br>
The process of producing the fermentation materials for use in this invention, while<br>
utilizing a shaken culture fermentation technique may also use such a technique for the<br>
initial stages or inoculum production as well. Production cultures are started from<br>
specially grown inocula. Growth is generally rapid at first. It then slows down and a<br>
stationary phase is usually reached. The production yield depends on the quantity of cells<br>
present, their specific activity, and the span of their product-forming capacity.<br>
The inoculum is placed in a liquid medium which is selected empirically for its<br>
ability to allow the recovery of the majority of the cells in the population. The spores<br>
produced on an initial growth medium, such as potato-dextrose agar, are transferred into<br>
growth medium contained in a flask (termed seed flask), that would allow for the<br>
germination and initial growth of culture. The germinated spores in an active growth<br>
state are then transferred to Erlenmeyer flasks (shake-flasks) or stationary-vat fermentors<br>
containing the specific fermentation medium. A 1-2% inoculum is typically produced for<br>
the fermentation stage of development.<br>
The inoculum medium is within the purview of those skilled in the art, and<br>
additional information may be found in the Manual of Industrial Microbiology and<br>
Biotechnology, pages 31-40, supra.<br>
A wide range of shaker-culture apparatus may be used in the practice of this<br>
invention. The main types of apparatus are based on either rotary or reciprocating<br>
shaking machines. The process herein preferably uses rotary shakers in which the flasks<br>
move in orbits of about 50 mm at about 200 to about 250 rpm, (but may vary between<br>
100 and 500 rpm). The culture moves smoothly around the inside of the flask (wnich is<br>
usually an Erlenmeyer flask). The scale-up of the fermentation process is well known to<br>
those skilled in the art.<br>
The purpose of shaking in submerged culture is to supply oxygen and nutrients to the<br>
growing cells. In shaken cultures, the medium in the fermentation flasks is inoculated<br>
with cells or spores, as is the case herein. The strain used as an inoculum is held as a<br>
master culture, in the freeze-dried state or at reduced temperatures, such as -70°C. The<br>
optimal spore concentration to be used for the inoculum is easily determined by those<br>
skilled in the art by routine experimentation.<br>
The biopesticidal compositions of the present invention can be used against plant<br>
parasitic nematodes, including, for example, Meloidogyne spp., Pratylenchus spp.,<br>
Radopholus similis, Ditylenchus dipsaci, Heterodera spp., Xiphinema spp., Globodera<br>
spp. and Hoplolaemus spp.<br>
The processed fermentation materials prepared according to the process of this<br>
invention can be used to control nematodes for a variety of agricultural applications on<br>
many different plants and fruits including, but not limited to, artichokes, aubergines,<br>
banana, barley, beet roots, cacao, carrots, cassava, celery, chickpea, citrus, coconut,<br>
coffee, cole crops, com, cotton, cowpea, eggplant, field bean, forages, ginseng, grape,<br>
guava, various lettuces, melons, millet, oat, okra, ornamentals, papaya, peanut, pepper,<br>
pigeon pea, pineapple, potatoes, rice, rye, sorghum, soybean, sugar beet, sugar cane,<br>
sweet peppers, sweet potato, tea, tobacco, tomatoes, turf, wheat and yam. Cultivated<br>
flowers can be protected according to the present invention, such as carnations, rose<br>
bushes, gerberas, chrysanthemums, pot plants, philodendrons, ferns, figs, pothos,<br>
sanseverias, and cacti; examples of nursery plants would include all the ornamental and<br>
flowering shrubs.<br>
The bioactive materials can be incorporated into the soil of flower pots or containers,<br>
by direct application to the area to be treated at the time of planting, or up to several days<br>
earlier, or by application in a controlled release form. Application to field or orchard<br>
crops can be by granule dispersement on the surface with turnover of the soil by a claw<br>
cultivar or a light plow, generally to about 10 cm up to about 20 cm depth of soil. As the<br>
nematocide is water soluble, a drip irrigation method for application is also possible.<br>
The compositions of the present invention can be in a suitable form for direct<br>
application or as a concentrate or primary composition which requires dilution with a<br>
suitable quantity of water or other diluent before application. The pesticidal<br>
concentration will vary depending upon the nature of the particular formation,<br>
specifically whether it is a concentrate or to be used directly.<br>
The nematocidally effective amount of the active materials will depend upon the<br>
population of the nematode expected to be encountered, the nematode type, soil, crop,<br>
and moisture. In general, the composition may be applied at a field rate of from about 1<br>
to about 200/lbs per acre; preferably at a rate of from about 5 to about 100/lbs per acre<br>
and most preferably at a rate of from about 10 to about 60 lbs/acre.<br>
The nematocidal compositions may be in the form of a suspension, a solution, an<br>
emulsion, a dusting powder, a dispersible granule, a wettable powder, an emulsifiable<br>
concentrate, an aerosol or impregnated granule, formulated by techniques well known to<br>
those skilled in the art.<br>
Additives to these compositions may include surface active agents, inert carriers,<br>
preservatives, humectants, feeding stimulants, attractants, encapsulating agents, binders,<br>
emulsifiers, dyes, U. V. protectants, buffers, flow agents, or other components which<br>
facilitate product handling and application for protection against nematodes.<br>
Examples of inert carriers include inorganic minerals such as kaolin, mica, gypsum,<br>
fertilizer, phyllosilicates, carbonates, sulfates, or phosphates; organic materials such as<br>
sugar, starches or cyclodextrins; or botanical materials such as wood products, cork,<br>
powdered corn cobs, rice hulls, peanut hulls and walnut shells.<br>
Suitable surface active agents include anionic compounds such as carboxylates, for<br>
example an alkali metal carboxylate of a long chain fatty acid; an N-acylsarcosinate;<br>
mono- or di-esters of phosphoric acid with fatty alcohol ethoxylates or salts of such<br>
esters; fatty alcohol sulfates such as sodium dodecyl sulfate, sodium octadecyl sulfate or<br>
sodium cetyl sulfate; ethoxylated fatty alcohol sulfates; ethoxylated alkylphenol sulfates;<br>
lignin sulfonates; petroleum sulfonates; alkyl aryl sulfonates such as alkyl benzene<br>
sulfonates or lower alkyl naphthalene sulfonates such as butyl naphthalene sulfonate;<br>
salts or sulfonated naphthalene-formaldehyde condensates; salts of sulfonated phenol-<br>
formaldehyde condensates or more complex sulfonates such as the amide sulfonates.<br>
Non-ionic agents include condensation products of fatty acid esters, fatty alcohols, fatty<br>
acid amides or fatty alkyl- or alkenyl- substituted phenols with ethylene oxide, fatty<br>
esters of polyhydric alcohol ethers, such as sorbitan fatty acid esters, condensation<br>
products of such esters with ethylene oxide, such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid<br>
esters, block copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, and acetylenic glycols.<br>
Examples of cationic surface active agents include an aliphatic mono-, di-, or polyamine<br>
as an acetate, naphthenate or oleate; an oxygen containing amine such as an amine oxide<br>
of polyoxyethylene alkylamine; an amide-linked amine prepared by the condensation of a<br>
carboxylic acid with a di- or polyamine; or a quaternary ammonium salt.<br>
It is also contemplated that the materials of this invention may be used in<br>
combination with other essential biologicals or beneficial microorganisms or active<br>
ingredients, such as herbicides, anti-microbials, fungicides, insecticides, plant growth<br>
regulators or nutrients.<br>
The compositions of this invention may also be formulated as active mixtures which<br>
may include finely divided dry or liquid diluents, extenders, fillers, conditioners, and<br>
excipients, including various clays, diatomaceous earth, talc and the like, or water and<br>
various organic liquids and mixtures thereof.<br>
Of course, the present invention is not limited to the particular embodiments and<br>
modes of operation described herein and it is possible to imagine a number of variations<br>
in the details without departing from the scope of this invention.<br>
The examples below are presented to describe preferred embodiments and utilities of<br>
the invention and are not meant to limit the invention unless otherwise stated in the<br>
claims appended hereto.<br>
Example 1<br>
Filter cakes (washed, damp fermentation solids) from two fungal fermentations were<br>
re-suspended in three times their weight of water, adjusted to pH 2.0 with sulfuric acid<br>
and heated in an autoclave at 121°C for three hours. The samples were cooled, re-<br>
adjusted to pH 4.05 - 4.10 with sodium hydroxide solution and made up with distilled<br>
water to a final weight eight times that of the cake used (12.5% concentration). Groups<br>
of approximately 50 root-knot nematodes for each replicate were incubated for 24 hours<br>
in these suspensions as well as a distilled water control and counted to determine<br>
mortality. The heat-treated fungal fermentation solids showed strong nematocidal<br>
activity, as indicated in Table 2.<br>
Example 2<br>
Dry material was recovered by lyophilization from a suspension of fermentation<br>
solids from an unclassified Streptomyces species. The solid material (4.56 g) was re-<br>
suspended in 40 mL of water, adjusted to pH 1.9 with sulfuric acid and heated at 121-<br>
122°C for three hours. After cooling, the pH was re-adjusted to 4.0 with sodium<br>
hydroxide solution, giving a final suspension containing 9% by weight of the<br>
fermentation solids. Groups of approximately 50 root-knot nematodes for each replicate<br>
were incubated for 24 hours with this suspension or with an antibiotic control solution<br>
(100 units of penicillin plus 0.1 mg of streptomycin per mL) and then counted to<br>
determine mortality. The heat-treated fermentation solid suspension was effective in<br>
killing the plant-parasitic nematodes, as shown in Table 3.<br>
Example 3<br>
Nematocidal Activity of Alkali Digested Fermentation Samples (Contact Assay)<br>
Myrothecium fermentation broth was heated in basic (alkaline) conditions, and the<br>
efficacy of the resulting materials was compared in a nematocidal assay (% mortality of<br>
root knot nematodes). The control broth sample was adjusted to neutral pH (pH 7), and<br>
other samples were adjusted to basic (pH 12) conditions. Half of each sample was heated<br>
at 121°C for two hours. Once cooled, all the samples were readjusted to neutral pH and<br>
lyophilized (dried to a powder). The powders were reconstituted in water to equal<br>
concentrations by weight and tested in a contact assay. The contact assay consisted of<br>
RKN incubated for 24 hours in five concentrations of each material, with multiple<br>
replications. The nematodes were counted, and the number of dead nematodes<br>
determined for each concentration for every sample. Data from this test was analyzed by<br>
PROBIT analysis to determine the LC50 (lethal concentration or dose to obtain an<br>
estimated 50% mortality of the nematodes within 95% confidence range). Fermentation<br>
broth when heated in basic condition showed increased toxicity to nematodes, indicated<br>
by a lower LC50 value for these materials, as shown in Table 7. Materials that were pH<br>
adjusted but not heated did not show a significant increase of toxicity to nematodes.<br>
Table 3<br>
When plant parasitic nematodes are placed in direct contact with the compositions so<br>
produced, the nematodes are paralyzed or killed, depending on the concentration of the<br>
composition applied. When the soil in which potted plants are growing is treated with a<br>
suspension of the product produced according to the method of this invention, and then<br>
inoculated with plant parasitic nematodes, after a growing period of several days, the<br>
plants are healthier, with larger and heavier aerial parts than untreated plants similarly<br>
inoculated with nematodes. The roots of the treated plants also exhibited fewer root galls<br>
(symptoms of nematode attack and invasion) than the untreated plants. In the field, the<br>
composition produced may be applied as a suspension in water or as a dry granular<br>
material to the plants to be protected from parasitic nematodes.<br>
Example 4<br>
Portions of whole fermentation beer from the submerged fermentation of<br>
Myrothecium sp. were adjusted to pH=s of 4, 8, 9,10 or 11 (V0.1) with sulfuric acid or<br>
sodium hydroxide and heated in an autoclave for two hours at 121°C. Control samples<br><br>
were pH adjusted but not heated. After heating, the samples were cooled to room<br>
temperature, and all samples were adjusted to pH 4.1 (VO. 1) using sulfuric acid. Then<br>
samples were diluted to a final concentration of 2% solids. Groups of Meloidogyne<br>
incognita (root-knot nematodes, RKN) were incubated in the suspensions as well as a<br>
dilute antibiotic control solution (1 unit/mL of penicillin and 0.1 mg/mL of streptomycin),<br>
and after 24 hours live and dead individuals were counted. Beer samples heated at<br>
elevated pH demonstrated increased nematocidal activity over non-heated samples, as<br>
shown in Table 8.<br>
