				<td>METHOD OF TRANSFERING A PRINT PATTERN ONTO AN<br>
OBJECTIVE BODY UNDER LIQUID PRESSURE<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
A  liquid- pressure   pattern   transfer   method,   a   liquid  pressure<br>
transferred article and coating material for liquid pressure pattern_transfer<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention pertains to a method of transferring a print pattern on<br>
various articles (objective bodies) such as metal articles, plastic moulds,<br>
ceramic articles and so on, a liquid pressure transfer article produced by this<br>
method and a coating material used for the liquid pressure pattern transfer<br>
method, and more particularly a method of suitably transferring a print<br>
pattern on such objective bodies as car panels, which will be used under<br>
severe atmospheres of temperature, humidity and so on, a liquid pressure<br>
transfer article produced by this method and a coating material suitably used<br>
for the liquid pressure pattern transfer method.<br>
TECHNICAL BACKGROUND<br>
A so-called liquid pressure pattern transfer method has been used for<br>
printing various patterns on an objective body having a complicated surface<br>
configuration of roughness or the like, but not a plane surface configuration.<br>
This liquid pressure pattern transfer method is one in which a pattern<br>
transfer film of liquid soluble or liquid swelling material having a<br>
predetermined print pattern of no liquid solubility is floated on a liquid<br>
surface within a transfer bath while being sequentially supplied thereto and<br>
is made swelled by the liquid and then the objective body is immersed into<br>
the liquid within the transfer bath in a manner faced to the pattern transfer<br>
film so that the print pattern on the pattern transfer film is transferred onto<br>
the objective body by using the liquid pressure.<br>
Since the print pattern on the pattern transfer film is in the dried and<br>
solid state, an ink of the print pattern is required to be activated by coating<br>
an activator on the print pattern so that tackiness is restored before the<br>
liquid pattern transfer is made. This activation operation is made either<br>
before the pattern transfer enters the transfer bath or after the pattern<br>
transfer film enters the transfer bath and is floated on liquid surface within<br>
the transfer bath. In general, the activator used for the activation operation<br>
comprises a binder resin imparting adhesion to the ink of the print pattern<br>
and a plasticizer imparting extensive or drawing property to a solvent and<br>
the ink (see JP8-2388987 or JP8-238898).<br>
In case that the objective body is formed of a non-polyolefin resin such<br>
(acrylonitrile butadiene styrene copolymer)<br>
as ABS/resin, polycarbonate resin, vinyl chloride or acrylic resin, the print<br>
pattern can be attached to the objective body in a good condition even though<br>
the print pattern is activated in a conventional manner, but in case that the<br>
objective body is formed of a polyolefin resin such as polyethylene or<br>
polypropylene, it is difficult to attach to the objective body the print pattern<br>
activated in a conventional manner because it has poor adhesion to the<br>
polyolefin resin. To avoid this, various treatments such as primer treatment,<br>
ultraviolet ray radiation, corona discharge or the like have been made to the<br>
objective body before the print pattern is transferred thereto.<br>
Of late, there has been a method in which the print pattern can be<br>
transferred onto the objective body of polyolefin resin without any primary<br>
treatment (see JP9-1996).<br>
In this method, an activator including a binder resin of a chlorinated<br>
polyolefin having a hydrophilic component imparted thereto is used for<br>
activating the print pattern on the pattern transfer film. With the<br>
aforementioned activator, the chlorinated polyolefin of the activator added to<br>
the ink when the print pattern is activated imparts good adhesion of the ink<br>
to the objective body of polyolefin resin and therefore the print pattern is<br>
adhered to the objective body in a good condition.<br>
Conventionally, in order to impart chemical resistance and weather<br>
resistance to the print pattern transferred to the objective body or provide<br>
good appearance thereto, a protection coat layer or top coat layer is applied to<br>
the objective body so as to cover the print pattern. In the prior art, the<br>
protection coat layer is formed by coating an urethane or acrylic coat material<br>
(see paragraph number 30 of JP9-1996). However, even though the print<br>
pattern has high adhesion imparted to the objective body of polyolefin resin<br>
by activating the print pattern by using the aforementioned method, the<br>
urethane or acrylic protection coat layer has poor adhesion to the objective<br>
body and the print pattern and therefore the predetermined adhesion<br>
strength of the print pattern cannot be maintained even immediately after it<br>
is coated and dried. Also, since the poor adhesion strength is further lowered<br>
as time elapses, the protection coat layer tends to rise so as to be removed out<br>
of the surface of the objective body, which cannot protect the print pattern<br>
and deteriorates the appearance of the objective body.<br>
Particularly, in case that the objective body such as inner or outer<br>
panel of a car is used in an outdoor atmosphere having a severe condition of<br>
humidity or temperature, both of the high adhesion of the print pattern to the<br>
objective body and the high adhesion of the protection coat layer to the<br>
objective body and the print pattern are required, but the prior protection<br>
coat layer cannot meet such requirements.<br>
Accordingly, a principal object of the invention is to provide a method<br>
of transferring a print pattern to an objective body under a liquid pressure in<br>
which a protection coat layer as well as a print pattern (a transferred<br>
pattern) activated by an activator including a binder resin of chlorinated<br>
polyolefin and transferred onto the objective body can be solidly adhered to<br>
the objective body whereby the print pattern can be effectively protected for a "<br>
longer time while it has an appearance arranged.<br>
It is another object of the invention is to provide a liquid pressure<br>
pattern transfer article in which a protection coat layer as well as a print<br>
pattern (a transferred pattern) activated by an activator including a binder<br>
resin of chlorinated polyolefin and transferred onto the objective body can be<br>
solidly adhered to the objective body whereby the print pattern can be<br>
effectively protected for a longer time while it has an appearance arranged.<br>
It is further object of the invention to provide a coating material used<br>
for transferring a print pattern onto an objective body in which a protection<br>
coat layer as well as a print pattern (a transferred pattern) activated by an<br>
activator including a binder resin of chlorinated polyolefin and transferred<br>
onto the objective body can be solidly adhered to the objective body whereby<br>
the print pattern can be effectively protected for a longer time while it has an<br>
appearance arranged.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
A fundamental method of the invention is a method of transferring a<br>
print pattern on an objective body under a liquid pressure comprising the<br>
steps of floating on a liquid surface a pattern transfer film having a print<br>
pattern activated by an activator, transferring the print pattern on the<br>
pattern transfer film onto the objective body under a liquid pressure produced<br>
by immersing the objective body below the liquid surface into the liquid while<br>
the objective body is faced to the pattern transfer film and then forming a<br>
protection coat layer on the objective body having the print pattern<br>
transferred, characterized by the activator to activate the print pattern<br>
containing a binder resin formed of a. [chlorinated polyolefin having a<br>
hydrophilic component imparted thereto and the protection coat layer being<br>
formed on the objective body with an intermediate coat layer placed between<br>
the objective body and the protection coat layer and having adhesion to all of<br>
the objective body, the print pattern thereon and the protection coat layer.<br>
A concrete method of the invention is a method of transferring a print<br>
pattern on an objective body under a liquid pressure comprising the steps of<br>
floating on a liquid surface a pattern transfer film having a print pattern<br>
activated by an activator, transferring the print pattern on the pattern<br>
transfer film onto the objective body under a liquid pressure produced by<br>
immersing the objective body below the liquid surface into the liquid while<br>
the objective body is faced to the pattern transfer film and then forming a<br>
protection  coat  layer   on  the  objective  body  having  the   print  pattern<br>
transferred,  characterized by the activator to activate the print pattern<br>
containing a binder resin formed of a graft copolymer comprising an alkoxy •<br>
(poly) aliylene-glycol • mono (metha) acrylate of 5 through 50 weight %, a<br>
chlorinated polypropylene resin of 5 through 50 weight % and a polymerized<br>
unsaturation group containing vinyl compound of 90 weight % or less than<br>
and the protection coat layer being formed on the objective body with an<br>
intermediate coat layer placed between the objective body and the protection<br>
coat layer and having adhesion to all of the objective body, the print pattern<br>
thereon and the protection coat layer.<br>
In the liquid pressure pattern transfer method of the invention, the<br>
intermediate coat layer may preferably contain a binder resin of a graft<br>
copolymer comprising an unsaturation group containing vinyl monomer of 5<br>
through 95 weight % having a homopolymer glass transition temperature of<br>
50°C or more thanN an unsaturation group containing vinyl monomer of 50<br>
weight % or less than having a homopolymer glass transition temperature of<br>
less than 50 °C and a chlorinated polypropylene resin of 1 through 50<br>
weight %.<br>
In the liquid pressure pattern transfer method of the invention, the<br>
protection coat layer may preferably include at least one of an acrylic polyol<br>
resin having a hydroxyl value of 10 - 200 mgKOH/g and a polyester polyol<br>
resin having a hydroxyl value of 10 - 400 mgKOH/g.<br>
In the liquid pressure pattern transfer method of the invention, with<br>
the intermediate coat layer including the binder resin of the graft copolymer<br>
comprising the unsaturation group containing vinyl monomer of 5 through 95<br>
weight % having the homopolymer glass transition temperature of 50°C or<br>
more than^ the unsaturation group containing vinyl monomer of 50 or less<br>
weight % having the homopolymer glass transition temperature of less than<br>
50°C and the chlorinated polypropylene resin of 1 through 50 weight % and<br>
with the protection coat layer including at least one of the acrylic polyol resin<br>
having the hydroxyl value of 10 - 200 mgKOH/g and the polyester polyol<br>
resin having the hydroxyl value of 10 - 400 mgKOH/g, these coat layers<br>
mutually act and therefore the protection coat layer of good quality can be<br>
formed.<br>
The invention also provides a liquid pressure pattern transferred<br>
article characterized by being produced by the liquid pressure pattern<br>
transfer method according to either of the first and second aspects<br>
The invention further provides a liquid pressure pattern transferring<br>
coating material used for the liquid pressure pattern transfer method,<br>
characterized by including a coating component to form an intermediate coat<br>
layer containing a binder resin of a graft copolymer comprising an<br>
unsaturation group containing vinyl monomer of 5 through 95 weight %<br>
having a homopolymer glass transition temperature of 50°C or more thanN an<br>
unsaturation group containing vinyl monomer of 50 weight % or less than<br>
having a homopolymer glass transition temperature of less than 50°C and a<br>
chlorinated polypropylene resin of 1 through 50 weight %.<br>
The liquid pressure pattern transferring coating material of the<br>
invention is characterized by including a coating component to form a<br>
protection coat layer including at least one of an acrylic polyol resin having a<br>
hydroxyl value of 10 - 200 mgKOH/g and a polyester polyol resin having a<br>
hydroxyl value of 10 - 400 mgKOH/g.<br>
In this manner, with the protection coat layer covering the print<br>
pattern transferred onto the objective body after activated by the activator<br>
containing the binder resin formed of the chlorinated polyolefin having the<br>
hydrophilic component added thereto and being formed on the objective body<br>
with the intermediate coat layer placed between the objective body and the<br>
protection coat layer and having adhesion to all of the objective body, the<br>
print pattern thereon and the protection coat layer, the protection coat layer<br>
and the print (transfer) pattern will be never removed out of the objective<br>
body of polyolefin and therefore the protection coat layer can maintain the<br>
chemical resistance, the weather resistance and the good appearance<br>
imparted to the objective body for a longer time.<br>
Especially, with the print pattern on the objective body activated by<br>
the activator containing the binder resin formed of the graft copolymer<br>
comprising the alkoxy • (poly) alkylene-glycol • mono (metha) acrylate of 5<br>
through 50 weight %, the chlorinated polypropylene resin of 5 through 50<br>
weight % and the polymerized unsaturation group containing vinyl compound<br>
of 90 weight % or less than, the chlorinated polypropylene resin in the<br>
activator enables the print pattern to be transferred onto the objective body<br>
while having higher adhesion thereto without any disarrangement of the<br>
pattern.<br>
In addition thereto, with the intermediate coat layer containing the<br>
binder resin of the graft copolymer comprising the unsaturation group<br>
containing vinyl monomer of 5 through 95 weight % having the homopolymer<br>
glass transition temperature of 50°C or more than the unsaturation group<br>
containing vinyl monomer of 50 weight % or less than having the<br>
homopolymer glass transition temperature of less than 50 °C and the<br>
chlorinated polypropylene resin of 1 through 50 weight % and with the<br>
protection coat layer including at least one of the acrylic polyol resin having<br>
the hydroxyl value of 10 — 200 mgKOH/g and the polyester polyol resin<br>
having the hydroxyl value of 10 - 400 mgKOH/g, the protection coat layer<br>
having the chemical resistance, the weather resistance and the good<br>
appearance of the objective body can be adhered with the higher adhesion to<br>
both of the print pattern transferred onto the objective body after activated by<br>
the activator containing the binder resin formed of the chlorinated polyolefin<br>
having the hydrophilic component added thereto and the objective body of<br>
polyolefin.<br>
More particularly, the chlorinated polypropylene resin in the<br>
intermediate coat layer causes the intermediate coat layer to have the higher<br>
adhesion to both of the print patter treated by the activator including the<br>
chlorinated polypropylene resin and the objective body having the print<br>
pattern transferred thereon and the protection coat layer adjusts aggregation<br>
force or cohesion force of such a degree as never damages both of the print<br>
(transfer) pattern transferred to the objective body after treated by the<br>
activator including the chlorinated polypropylene resin having not so much<br>
aggregation force and the intermediate coat layer including the chlorinated<br>
polyolefin resin whereby the chemical resistance, the weather resistance and<br>
the good appearance of the protection coat layer can be arranged.<br>
Why the graft copolymer as the binder resin among the coating<br>
components of the intermediate coat layer comprises the unsaturation group<br>
containing vinyl monomers of different glass transition temperatures Tg is<br>
used is to maintain the appropriate aggregation force (strength) and the<br>
appropriate tackiness (adhesion) in good balance.<br>
More particularly, the aggregation force imparts the strength to the<br>
coat layer while the tackiness imparts the adhesion (deformation follow)<br>
thereto. As the binder resin of the intermediate coat layer having the stronger<br>
aggregation force in order to improve the strength thereof, the coat layer is<br>
shrunk because of the strength leading to the hardness of the chemical<br>
bondage. This causes a crack of the coat layer and an increase in stress of the<br>
upper and lower coat layers. Although the tackiness improves the adhesion<br>
and the   flowability    of the coat layer, the strength and the tackiness of the<br>
intermediate coat layer should be balanced relative to the print pattern<br>
adhered to the objective body after activated by the activator including the<br>
chlorinated polyolefin and placed under the intermediate coat layer and also<br>
relative to the protection coat layer placed on the intermediate coat layer. The<br>
strength and the tackiness of the binder resin of the intermediate coat layer<br>
can be balanced by using ones having the glass transition temperature<br>
different from each other.<br>

BEST MODE FOR EMBODYING THE INVENTION<br>
A mode of embodiment of the invention will be described hereinafter.<br>
Fig.  1 illustrates in a stepped manner the steps of embodying a liquid<br>
pressure pattern transfer method to which the invention is applied. As shown<br>
in Fig. 1A, a pattern transfer film 14 having a predetermined print pattern<br>
12 printed on a base film 10 may be fed  from a not<br>
shown film supply source to activator application means 16 such as an<br>
activator coating bath 16R, for instance. The activator coating bath 16R<br>
serves to coat an activator 20 onto the print pattern 12 on the pattern<br>
transfer film 14 being held between a coating roll 22 and a pressure roll 24 so<br>
as to attach the activator 20 to the print pattern within a bath body 18 so<br>
that the print pattern 12 is activated by the activator 20. For the activator 20<br>
may be used one including a binder resin formed of a chlorinated polyolefin<br>
having a hydrophobic component imparted thereto as described later. As the<br>
print pattern 12 is activated, the ink of the print pattern 12 is on the state of<br>
being dissolved and being capable of being transferred.<br>
The pattern transfer film 14 having the print pattern 12 activated in<br>
this manner is fed through a guide roll 26 shown in Fig. 1A to liquid pressure<br>
transfer means 30 shown in Fig. IB. The liquid pressure transfer means 30<br>
comprises a liquid pressure transfer bath 32 within which the activated<br>
pattern transfer film 14 is floated with the print pattern 12 upwardly faced.<br>
The pattern transfer film 14 is supplied at predetermined velocity to a<br>
transfer area 36 to which a transfer objective body 34 is downwardly supplied<br>
from an upper side. A liquid 38 that is typically water is filled within the<br>
transfer bath 32 and is sequentially circulated through a not shown liquid<br>
circulation apparatus including a purifier, a pump and so on. The pattern<br>
transfer film 14 is floated on the surface 38S of the liquid 38 and advanced<br>
flowing on the stream of the liquid 38 or by an appropriate transport means.<br>
The transfer objective body 34 is immersed into the liquid 38 in the<br>
transfer area 36 with the transfer face 34F thereof being faced to the liquid<br>
surface 38S as shown in Fig.lC. Since the pattern transfer film 14 is subject<br>
to the liquid pressure generated by the immersion of the transfer objective<br>
body 34 into the liquid, the pattern transfer film 14 is attached to the surface<br>
of the transfer objective body 34 by the liquid pressure and therefore the<br>
print pattern 12 on the pattern transfer film 14 is transferred onto the<br>
transfer face 34F of the transfer objective body 34 (see Fig. ID). Since the<br>
base film of the pattern transfer film 14 is formed of liquid-soluble or liquid<br>
swelling materials, it is dissolved or swollen by the liquid 38 within the liquid<br>
pressure transfer bath 32 without being attached onto the objective body 34.<br>
If the base film would possibly remain attached onto the objective body 34, it<br>
would be removed out by appropriate removal means at the later step.<br>
In the method of the invention, the objective body 34 having the print<br>
pattern (referred to as the transferred pattern 12 hereinafter) transferred in<br>
this manner passes through first coat material application (or spray) means<br>
40 as shown in Fig. 2 to have a transparent intermediate coat layer 42 coated<br>
and then passes through second coat material application (or spray) means<br>
44 to have a transparent or semitransparent protection coat layer 46 coated<br>
on the intermediate coat layer 42. The components of these coat layers 42 and<br>
46 will be described in detail later.<br>
The Fujikura Kasei Co., Ltd., one of the applicants, has proposed a<br>
method for activating the print pattern 12 for improving adhesion to the<br>
transfer objective body 34 formed of a product such as a polyolefin resin<br>
mould having poor adhesion of the print pattern from the pattern transfer<br>
film 14 and a binder resin for an activator used for the method (see<br>
JP9-19996 and JP9-76700). In this method, there is used the activator<br>
including a binder resin of a graft copolymer comprising an alkoxy •<br>
(poly)alkylene-glycol • mono (metha) acrylate of 5 through 50 weight %, a<br>
chlorinated polypropylene resin of 5 through 50 weight % and a polymerized<br>
unsaturation group containing vinyl compound of 0 through 90 weight % for<br>
activating the print pattern 12.<br>
The activator may be formed by adding an inorganic fiber and a<br>
plasticizer to the aforementioned binder resin as required and dissolving<br>
them in an appropriate organic solvent such as a toluene, xylene or the like at<br>
an appropriate weight ratio. Since the activator includes the chlorinated<br>
polypropylene, the print pattern can be attached onto the polyolefin resin<br>
product in a good manner without any surface treatment made for improving<br>
the adhesion of the print pattern to the product. Also, since the chlorinated<br>
polypropylene has the hydrophilic property imparted by being grafted with<br>
the hydrophihc alkoxy • (poly)alkylene-glycol'mono (metha) acrylate, the print<br>
pattern 12 treated by such an activator can be uniformly and sufficiently<br>
extended on the liquid (water) surface 38S within the liquid pressure<br>
(hydraulic pressure) transfer bath 32 even though the organic solvent of the<br>
activator is hydrophobic. Thus, it will be noted that the print pattern 12 can<br>
be attached onto the polyolefin resin product (objective body 34) in a<br>
satisfactory manner without any disarrangement of the pattern.<br>
In the method of the invention, as aforementioned, the transparent<br>
intermediate coat layer 42 is coated on the objective body 34 having the<br>
transferred pattern 12T and thereafter the transparent or semitransparent<br>
protection coat layer 44 is coated on the intermediate coat layer 42. The<br>
method of the invention is characterized in that the intermediate coat layer<br>
42 contains a binder resin of a graft copolymer comprising an unsaturation<br>
group containing vinyl monomer of 5 through 95 weight % having a<br>
homopolymer glass transition temperature of 50 CC or more than^ an<br>
unsaturation group containing vinyl monomer of 50 weight % or less than<br>
having a homopolymer glass transition temperature of less than 50°C and a<br>
chlorinated polypropylene resin of 1 through 50 weight %while the protection<br>
coat layer 44 includes at least one of an acrylic polyol resin having a hydroxyl<br>
value of 10 - 200 mgKOH/g and a polyester polyol resin having a hydroxyl<br>
value of 10 - 400 mgKOH/g.                             <br>
The coating material used for the protection coat layer and including<br>
at least one of the acrylic polyol resin having the hydroxyl value of 10 — 200<br>
mgKOH/g and the polyester polyol resin having the hydroxyl value of 10 -<br>
400 mgKOH/g serves to maintain for a longer time the chemical resistance,<br>
the weather resistance, the physical strength and the luster which are<br>
required for the protection coat layer and which can be obtained by the bridge<br>
structure of the coating material caused by its combination with a curing<br>
agent of isocyanate or the like and to improve adhesion to the objective body.<br>
The hydroxyl value of the acrylic polyol resin or the polyester polyol resin<br>
which is the coating component for the protection coat layer should be set so<br>
as to provide the predetermined physical strength and the predetermined<br>
adhesion in a balanced manner.<br>
More particularly, if the hydroxyl value of the acrylic polyol resin is<br>
less than 10 mgKOH/g or if the hydroxyl value of the polyester polyol resin is<br>
less than 10 mgKOH/g, the bridge density of them gets smaller, which causes<br>
the physical strength of the protection coat layer to be reduced. If the<br>
hydroxyl value of the acrylic polyol resin exceeds 200 mgKOH/g or if the<br>
hydroxyl value of the polyester polyol resin exceeds 400 mgKOH/g, the<br>
aggregation force gets larger, which causes the adhesion force of the<br>
protection coat layer to be reduced. Thus, the hydroxyl value of the acrylic<br>
polyol resin is preferably of 10 through 200 mgKOH/g or the hydroxyl value of<br>
the polyester polyol resin is preferably of 10 through 400 mgKOH/g. These<br>
resins can be used for the protection coat layer while being dissolved in an<br>
appropriate solvent such as a toluene, xylene or the like.<br>
As examples of the acrylic polyol resin having the hydroxyl value of 10<br>
through 200 mgKOH/g for the protection coat layer may be listed ones<br>
manufactured by Toray Industries, Inc., Japan and commercially available<br>

On the other hand, the intermediate coat layer 42 has the function of<br>
having the improved adhesion to both of the transfer objective body having<br>
the transferred pattern 12T and the protection coat layer 44 so that the<br>
protection coat layer 44 is not directly adhered to the transfer objective body<br>
34. The intermediate coat layer 42 containing the binder resin of the graft<br>
copolymer comprising the unsaturation group containing vinyl monomer of 5<br>
through 95 weight % having the homopolymer glass transition temperature<br>
of 50°C or more than^ the unsaturation group containing vinyl monomer of<br>
less than 50 weight % having the homopolymer glass transition temperature<br>
of 50°C or less than and the chlorinated polypropylene resin of 1 through 50<br>
weight % is suitable for the intermediate coat layer having such a function. In<br>
particular, in case that the transfer objective body is formed of the polyolefin<br><br>
resin and also in case that the transferred pattern 12T thereon is formed<br>
after activated by the activator including the binder resin of the chlorinated<br>
polyolefin having the hydrophilic component added thereto and transferring<br>
it on the transfer objective body, the aforementioned intermediate coat layer<br>
can accomplish the more excellent effect. The intermediate coat layer 42 can<br>
be obtained by coating the material for the intermediate coat layer formed by<br>
dissolving the aforementioned binder resin in an organic solvent such as a<br>
toluene, xylene or the like.<br>
Since the unsaturation group containing vinyl monomers having the<br>
glass transition temperature different from each other are used as the graft<br>
copolymer of the binder resin in the coating components of the intermediate<br>
coat layer 42, the appropriate aggregation force (strength) and the<br>
appropriate tackiness force (adhesion) of the binder resin can be maintained<br>
in a balanced manner.<br>
More particularly, if the unsaturation group containing monomer has<br>
the glass transition temperature of 50°C or more than, the binder resin will<br>
have higher aggregation force and therefore higher strength, but it will have<br>
lower tackiness and therefore lower adhesion. If the unsaturation group<br>
containing vinyl monomer has the glass transition temperature of less than<br>
50 °C, the binder resin will have higher tackiness and therefore higher<br>
adhesion, but it will have lower aggregation force and therefore lower<br>
strength. With the binder resin of the intermediate coat layer 42 formed of<br>
the graft copolymer of both of the unsaturation group containing vinyl<br>
monomer having the glass transition temperature of 50°C or more than and<br>
the unsaturation group containing vinyl monomer having the glass transition<br>
temperature of less than 50°C together with chlorinated polypropylene resin,<br>
the appropriate and balanced strength and adhesion can be imparted to the<br>
intermediate coat layer.<br>
If the unsaturation group containing vinyl monomer having the glass<br>
transition temperature of 50°C or more than is of less than 5 weight %, then<br>
the aggregation force of the binder resin cannot be obtained and its strength<br>
is lowered and if it exceeds 95 weight %, then the adhesion is lowered. If the<br>
unsaturation group containing vinyl monomer having the glass transition<br>
temperature of less than 50°C exceeds 50 weight %, then the aggregation<br>
force of the binder resin is lowered and therefore its strength is lowered. If<br>
the content of the chlorinated polypropylene resin is less than 1 weight %,<br>
then the adhesion is lowered and if it exceeds 50 weight %, then its strength<br>
is lowered.<br>
As examples of the unsaturation group containing vinyl monomer<br>
having the glass transition temperature of 50°C or more than used for the<br>
homopolymer of the intermediate coat layer are listed styrene, a -methyl<br>
styrene, vinyl toluene, methacrylic acid, methacrylic methyl, methacrylic<br>

In the mode of embodiment aforementioned, the intermediate coat<br>
layer 42 and the protection coat layer 44 are described and illustrated to be<br>
formed by coating the coating materials by the spray coating process, but<br>
they may be formed by any other suitable processes such as a gravure coating<br>
process, roll coating process, a curtain flow coating process or the likes.<br>

protection coat layer 44 used by the method of the invention will be described<br>
hereinafter.<br>
Describing an example of a method of producing the binder resin for<br>
the intermediate coat layer, respective components of the composition (A)<br>
indicated in Table 1 were prepared in a four-port flask of 1 liter provided with<br>
an agitator, a cooler and a monomer dropper. The components were heated<br>
until it reaches an inner temperature of 90°C while the agitator is operated<br>
and held at 90 °C for 20 minutes. Thereafter, the monomers of the<br>
compositions (B) were dropped into the components in an hour and half and<br>
after they were dropped, the components of the composition (C) were added<br>
thereto. Then, the components (A) through (C) were held at 90°C for three<br>
hours until they were polymerized to produce the copolymer resin solution.<br>
Thereafter, the copolymer resin solution was diluted in a toluene to produce<br>
the coating materials for the intermediate coat layer. In Table I, the content<br>
of the components are indicated by weight parts.<br>

The results obtained by estimating the appearance, the initial<br>
adhesion state and the secondary adhesion state of the objective bodies (the<br>
liquid pressure transfer articles) produced by Examples 1 through 3 and<br>
Comparisons 1 through 6 are as shown in Table III. In the estimation, the<br>
appearance was estimated using the symbols of O indicating the value of 90<br>
or more than obtained by determining the appearance of the articles relative<br>
to the 60° luster given by the measurement by the gloss meter, A indicating<br>
the value of 80 to 90 and X indicating the value of less 80. The initial<br>
adhesion state is one obtained by measuring the adhesion condition<br>
immediately after the protection coat layer was formed while the secondary<br>
adhesion is one obtained by measuring the adhesion condition after the<br>
waterproof test of the formed protection coat layer for 24 hours at 40°C or the<br>
moisture resistance test of the formed protection coat layer under the<br>
humidity of 95 % for 500 hours at 50°C was made. The adhesion state was<br>
measured by the adhesion test (gap of 1mm and square number of 100)<br>
according to the "8.5.1 cross-cut adhesion tape method" of JIS (Japan<br>
Industrial Standard) -K5400. The adhesion states were estimated using the<br>
symbols of O indicating that no evidence of removal of the protection coat<br>
layer was found, A indicating that removal of 1/100 or more than and less<br>
than 10/100 of the protection coat layer was found and X indicating that<br>
removal of 10/100 or more than of the protection coat layer was found.<br>
TABLE III<br>
As apparent from Table III, in Examples 1 through 3 in which the<br>
intermediate coat layer contained the binder resin of the graft copolymer<br>
comprising the unsaturation group containing vinyl monomer of 5 through 95<br>
having the homopolymer glass transition temperature of 50°C or more thanN<br>
the unsaturation group containing vinyl monomer of 50 weight % or less than<br>
having the homopolymer glass transition temperature of less than 50°C and<br>
the chlorinated polypropylene resin of 1 through 50 weight % and the<br>
protection coat layer included at least one of the acrylic polyol resin having<br>
the hydroxyl value of 10 - 200 mgKOH/g and the polyester polyol resin<br>
having the hydroxyl value of 10 - 400 mgKOH/g, all of the appearance, the<br>
initial adhesion state and the secondary adhesion state of the protection coat<br>
layer were good and therefore it will be noted that good adhesion state of the<br>
improved protection coat layer and the improved printed or transferred<br>
pattern on the polyolefin objective body could be maintained for a longer time.<br>
On the other hand, in Comparisons 1 and 2 in which the prior art<br>
activator containing no chlorinated polypropylene was used, in Comparisons<br>
5 and 6 in which the intermediate coat layer was not applied or in<br>
Comparison 4 in which the intermediate coat layer contained no graft<br>
copolymer comprising the two unsaturation group containing vinyl monomer<br>
having the glass transition temperature different from each other and the<br>
chlorinated polyolefin resin, even though, in all the Comparisons, the<br>
protection coat layer containing the acrylic polyol resin having the hydroxyl<br>
value of 10 - 200 mgKOH/g or the polyester polyol resin having the hydroxyl<br>
value of 10 - 400 mgKOH/g was used, it will be noted that the appearance<br>
(Comparison 6), the initial adhesion state (Comparisons 1 through 6) and the<br>
secondary adhesion state (Comparisons 1 through 6) were poor. Especially, it<br>
will be noted that the method other than that of the invention cannot be<br>
suitable for the objective bodies such as inner or outer panels for cars used<br>
outdoors under the severe atmospheres of temperature, humidity and so on<br>
and required to have the high adhesion state of the protection coat layer.<br>
According to the invention, as aforementioned, since the protection<br>
coat layer covering the print pattern transferred onto the objective body after<br>
activated by the activator containing the binder resin of the chlorinated<br>
polyolefin having the hydrophilic component added thereto is formed on the<br>
objective body with the intermediate coat layer placed between the objective<br>
body and the protection coat layer and having the adhesion to all of the<br>
objective body, the print pattern thereon and the protection coat layer, the<br>
printed or transferred pattern, the intermediate coat layer and the protection<br>
coat layer are never removed out of the objective body of polyolefin and<br>
therefore the protection coat layer can have the good appearance arranged<br>
and can maintain the chemical resistance and the weather resistance for a<br>
longer time.<br>
Especially, with the print pattern on the objective body activated by<br>
the activator containing the binder resin formed of the graft copolymer<br>
comprising an alkoxy • (poly) alkylene-glycol • mono (metha) acrylate of 5<br>
through 50 weight %, the chlorinated polypropylene resin of 5 through 50<br>
weight % and the polymerized unsaturation group containing vinyl compound<br>
of 90 weight % or less than, the chlorinated polypropylene resin in the<br>
activator enables the print pattern to be transferred onto the objective body of<br>
polyolefin resin product while having the improved adhesion thereto without<br>
any  disarrangement  of the  pattern,   and in.  addition thereto,  with the<br>
intermediate coat layer including the binder resin of the graft copolymer<br>
comprising the unsaturation group containing vinyl monomer of 5 through 95<br>
weight % having the homopolymer glass transition temperature of 50CC or<br>
more thanN the unsaturation group containing vinyl monomer of 50 weight %<br>
or less than having the homopolymer glass transition temperature of less<br>
than 50°C and the chlorinated polypropylene resin of 1 through 50 weight %<br>
and with the protection coat layer including at least one of the acrylic polyol<br>
resin having the hydroxyl value of 10 - 200 mgKOH/g and the polyester<br>
polyol resin having the hydroxyl value of 10 - 400 mgKOH/g, the protection<br>
coat layer can be adhered with the higher adhesion to both of the print<br>
pattern transferred onto the objective body while activated by the activator<br>
containing  the   binder   resin   of the   chlorinated  polyolefin   having   the<br>
hydrophihc component added thereto and the polyolefin objective body and<br>
therefore the protection coat layer can have the good appearance arranged<br>
and can maintain the chemical resistance and the weather resistance for a<br>
longer time.<br>
The liquid pressure pattern transferred article having the intermediate<br>
coat layer including the binder resin of the graft copolymer which comprises<br>
the unsaturation group containing vinyl monomer of 5 through 95 weight %<br>
having the homopolymer glass transition temperature of 50°C or more than-,<br>
the unsaturation group containing vinyl monomer of 50 weight % or less than<br>
having the homopolymer glass transition temperature of less than 50°C and<br>
the chlorinated polypropylene resin of 1 through 50 weight % and the<br>
protection coat layer including at least one of the acrylic polyol resin having<br>
the hydroxyl value of 10 - 200 mgKOH/g and the polyester polyol resin<br>
having the hydroxyl value of 10 - 400 mgKOH/g can have the good<br>
appearance arranged by the protection coat layer and can have the chemical<br>
resistance and the weather resistance maintained for a longer time.<br>
The coating material for the intermediate coat layer including the<br>
binder resin of the graft copolymer which comprises the unsaturation group<br>
containing vinyl monomer of 5 through 95 weight % having the homopolymer<br>
glass transition temperature of 50°C or more than., the unsaturation group<br>
containing vinyl monomer of 50 weight % or less than having the<br>
homopolymer glass transition temperature of less than 50 °C and the<br>
chlorinated polypropylene resin of 1 through 50 weight % and the coating<br>
material for the protection coat layer including at least one of the acrylic<br>
polyol resin having the hydroxyl value of 10 - 200 mgKOH/g and the<br>
polyester polyol resin having the hydroxyl value of 10 — 400 mgKOH/g can<br>
serve to solidly adhere the transferred pattern and the coating materials<br>
themselves to the objective body and therefore they are suitable for producing<br>
the liquid pressure pattern transfer article having the good appearance<br>
arranged by the protection coat layer and can have the transferred pattern<br>
maintained for a longer time.<br>
UTILIZABILITY OF INDUSTRIES<br>
As  aforementioned,   the   method  according to  the  invention  can<br>
