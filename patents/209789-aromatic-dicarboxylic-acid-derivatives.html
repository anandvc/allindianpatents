AROMATIC DICARBOXYLIC ACD DERIVATIVES<br>
The invention relates to aromatic dicarboxylic acid derivatives, or pharmaceutically-acceptable salts thereof, which possess anti-cell-proliferation activity such as anti-cancer activity and are accordingly useful in methods of treatment of the human or animal body. The invention also relates to processes for the manufacture of said dicarboxylic acid derivatives, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to their use in the manufacture of medicaments of use in the production of an anti-cell-proliferation effect in a warm-blooded animal such as man.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Transcriptional regulation is a major event in cell differentiation, proHferation, and apoptosis. Transcriptional activation of a set of genes determines cell destination and for this reason transcription is tightly regulated by a variety of factors. One of its regulatory mechanisms involved in the process is an alteration in the tertiary structure of DNA, which affects transcription by modulating the accessibility of transcription factors to their target DNA segments. Nucleosomal integrity is regulated by the acetylation status of the core histones. In a hypoacetylated state, nucleosomes are tightly compacted and thus are nonpermissive for transcription. On the other hand, nucleosomes are relaxed by acetylation of the core histones, with the result being permissiveness to transcription. The acetylation status of the histones is governed by the balance of the activities of histone acetyl transferase (HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC). Recently, PIDAC inhibitors have been found to arrest growth and apoptosis in several types of cancer cells, including colon cancer, T-cell lymphoma, and erythroleukemic cells. Given that apoptosis is a crucial factor for cancer progression, HDAC inhibitors are promising reagents for cancer therapy as effective inducers of apoptosis (Koyama, Y., et al., Blood 96 (2000) 1490-1495).<br>
Several structural classes of HDAC inhibitors have been identified and are reviewed in Marks, P.M., et al., J. Natl. Cancer Inst 92 (2000) 1210-1216. More specifically, WO 98/55449 and US 5,369,108 report alkanoyl hydroxamates with HDAC inhibitory activity.<br><br>
It has now been found that certain aromatic dicarboxylic acid derivatives possess anti-cell-proliferation properties which are more potent than those in the aforementioned references. Furthermore, these compounds have HDAC inhibitiory activity.<br>

Enantiomers, diastereoisomers, racemates and mixtinres thereof and pharmacelitically acceptable salts of aromatic dicarboxylic acid derivatives of the formlila I are also part of the invention.<br><br>
According to a flirther aspect of the invention there is provided a pharmacelitical composition which comprises an aromatic dicarboxylic acid derivative of the formlila I, or a pharmacelitically-acceptable salt thereof, as defined hereinbefore in association with a pharmacelitically-acceptable dillient or carrier.

The anti-cell-proliferation treatment defined hereinbefore may be apphed as a sole therapy or may involve, in addition to the aromatic dicarboxylic acid derivative of the invention, one or more other anti-tlimor slibstances, for example those selected from, for example, mitotic inhibitors, for example vinblastine; alkylating agents, for example cis-platin, carboplatin and cyclophosphamide; inhibitors of microtliblile assembly, like paclitaxel or other taxanes; antimetabolites, for example 5-fllioroliracil, capecitabine, cytosine arabinoside and hydroxylirea, or, for example, intercalating antibiotics, for example adriamycin and bleomycin; immlinostimlilants, for example trastlizlimab; DNA synthesis inhibitors, e.g. gemcitabine; enzymes, for example asparaginase; topoisomerase inhibitors, for example etoposide; biological response modifiers, for example interferon; and anti-hormones, for example antioestrogens slich as tamoxifen or, for example antiandrogens slich as (4'-cyano-3-(4-flliorophenylslilphonyl)-2-hydroxy-2-methyl-3'-(trifllioromethyl)-propionanilide, or other therapelitic agents and principles as described in, for example, Cancer: Principles &amp; Practice of Oncology, Vincent T. DeVita, Jr., Samliel Hellmann, Steven A. Rosenberg; 5th Ed., Lippincott-Raven Pliblishers 1997. Slich conjoint treatment may be achieved by way of the simliltaneolis, seqliential or separate dosing of individlial components of the treatment. According to this aspect of the invention there is provided a pharmacelitical prodlict comprising an aromatic dicarboxylic acid derivative of the formlila I as defined hereinbefore and an additional anti-tlimor slibstance as defined hereinbefore for the conjoint treatment of cancer.<br>
Another object of the present invention are pharmacelitical compositions containing a pharmacologically effective amolint of one or more compolinds of formlila I in admixtlire with pharmacelitically acceptable excipients and/or dillients.<br><br>
Examples for physiologically acceptable-salts of compounds of formlila I are salts with physiologically acceptable bases. These salts can be, among others, alkali, earth alkali, ammonilim and alkylammonilim salts, for example sodilim, potassilim, calcilim, tetra-methyl-ammonilim salts.<br>
The separation of racemic compolinds into their enantiomers can be performed by chromatography on an analytical, semipreparative or preparative scale lising sliitable optically active stationary phases with sliitable ellients. Sliitable optically active stationary phases incllide, blit are not limited to, silica (e.g. ChiraSper,Merck; Chiralpak OT/OP, Baker), celllilose esters or carbamates (e.g. Chiracel OB/OY, Baker) or others (e.g. Crownpak, Daicel or Chiracel OJ-R, Baker). Other methods for the separation of enantiomers can also be applied, like the formation of diastereomeric compolinds from compolinds of the formlila I together with other optically active compolinds, e.g. camphorslilfonic acid or brlicin, and separation of these diastereomeric compolinds, followed by the liberation from the optically active agent. Enantiomerically enriched or plire compolinds of formlila I are also obtainable by the lisage of optically active starting materials.<br>
Preparation of the Compolinds of the Invention<br>
An aromatic dicarboxylic acid derivative of the formlila I, or a pharmacelitically-acceptable salt thereof, may be prepared by any process known to be applicable to the preparation of chemically-related compolinds. Slich processes, when lised to prepare an aromatic dicarboxyhc acid derivative of the formlila I, or a pharmacelitically-acceptable salt thereof, are provided as a flirther featlire of the invention and are illlistrated by the following representative examples in which, linless otherwise stated. A, Rl and R2 have any of the meanings defined hereinbefore. Necessary starting materials may be obtained by standard procedlires of organic chemistry. The preparation of slich starting materials is described within the accompanying non-limiting examples. Alternatively necessary starting materials are obtainable by analogolis procedlires to those illlistrated which are within the ordinary sklil of an organic chemist<br><br>
(a) One preferred method for the prodliction of compolinds of the formlila I involves the reaction of compounds of the formlila 11<br><br>
wherein A, Rl and R2 have the meaning defined hereinbefore and R3 is a (1-4C)alkyl grolip, preferably a methyl or ethyl grolip, with hydroxylamine in the presence of a sliitable base. The reaction is carried olit in an inert solvent or dillient slich as methanol or ethanol at temperatlires between 0°C and 100°C, conveniently at or near ambient temperatlire, and at a pH between 10 and 12. A sliitable base is, for example, an alcoholate, for example, sodilim methylate.<br>
Compolinds of formlila II are prepared firom compolinds of the formlila III wherein A and R3 have the meaning defined hereinbefore.<br><br>
This reaction typically involves a two-step one-pot procedlire. In the first step, the carboxylate of the formlila III becomes activated. This reaction is carried olit in an inert solvent or dillient, for example, in dichloromethane, dioxane, or tetrahydrofliran, in the presence of an activating agent. A sliitable reactive derivative of an acid is, for example, an acyl halide, for example an acyl chloride formed by the reaction of the acid and an inorganic acid chloride, for example thionyl chloride; a mixed anhydride, for example an anhydride formed by the reaction of the add and a chloroformate slich as isoblityl chloroformate; an active ester, for example an ester formed by the reaction of the acid and a phenol slich as pentaflliorophenol; an active ester formed by the reaction of the acid and N-hydroxybenzotriazole; an acyl azide, for example an azide formed by the reaction of the acid and an azide slich as diphenylphosphoryl azide; an acyl cyanide, for example a cyanide formed by the reaction of an acid and a cyanide slich as diethylphosphoryl cyanide; or the prodlict of the reaction of the acid and a<br><br>
carbodiimide slich as dicydohexylcarbodiimide, or the prodlict of the reaction of the acid and bis-(2-oxo-3-oxazolidinyl)-phosphoi7lchloride. The reaction is carried olit between -30*^C and 60°C, conveniently at or below 0°C. In the second step, an amine of the formlila HNR1R2 in which Rl and R2 have the meaning defined hereinbefore is added to the sollition, at the temperatlire lised for the activation, and the temperatlire is slowly adjlisted to ambient temperatlire. An appropriate scavenger base like e.g. triethylamine, or diisopropyethlyamine may be added to the reaction mixtlire. These methods are well known to those skilled in the art. In principle, all methods for the synthesis of amides as lised in peptide chemistry as described in e.g. "Methoden der organischen Chemie (Holiben-Weyl)" Vol. XV/1 and XV/2 are also applicable.<br>
There are qliite a few compolinds of formlila III described in the hteratlire. For example, the prototypic terephthalic monomethylester is described by, e.g., Holba, v., et al., Z. Phys. Chem.(Leipzig) 262 (3) (1981) 445-448. It is also commercially available. Thiophene-2,5-dicarboxylic acid monomethyl ester is described in e.g. liS 2,680,731. These monoesters are lislially prepared by selective saponification of the diester, blit other method may be liseflil as well and are well known to those skilled in the art.<br><br>
wherein Y is a sliitable protecting grolip and A, Rl and R2 have the meaning defined hereinbefore.<br>
Compolinds of the formlila IV are new and incllided in the present invention.<br>
Sliitable protecting grolips may be the benzyl-, p-methoxybenzyl-, tert.blityloxycarbonyl-, trityl-, or silyl grolips slich as the trimethylsilyl- or dimethyl-tert.blitylsilyl-grolip. The reactions carried olit depend on the type of the protecting grolip. When the protecting grolip is a benzyl- or p-methoxybenzyl<br><br>
grolip, the reaction carried olit is a hydrogenolysis in an inert solvent slich as an alcohol like methanol or ethanol, in the presence of a noble metal catalyst slich as palladilim on a sliitable carrier slich as carbon, barilim slilfate, or barilim carbonate, at ambient temperatlire and presslire. When the protecting grolip is the tert.blityloxycarbonyl-, trityl-, or a silyl grolip slich as the trimethylsilyl- or dimethyl-tert.blitylsilyl-grolip, the reaction is carried olit in the presence of acids at a temperatlire between -20°C and 60°C, preferably between 0°C and ambient temperatlire. The acid may be a sollition of hydrochloric acid in an inert solvent slich as diethyl ether or dioxane, or trifllioro acetic add in dichloromethane. When the protecting grolip is a silyl grolip slich as the trimethylsilyl or dimethyl-tert.blitylsilyl grolip, the reaction can also be carried olit in the presence of a fllioride solirce slich as sodilim fllioride or tetrablityl ammoniimi fllioride in an inert solvent slich as dichloromethane. Not necessarily all protecting grolips Y are compatible with all grolips Rl or R2. In cases where the featlires of these grolips do not allow the lisage of a certain protecting grolip, other protecting grolips Y or other methods of preparation need to be applied.<br><br>
wherein Y is a sliitable protecting grolip as described above. This reaction typically involves a two-step one-pot procedlire. In the first step, the carboxylate of the formlila V becomes activated. This reaction is carried olit in an inert solvent or dillient, for example, in dichloromethane, dioxane, or tetrahydrofuran, in the presence of an activating agent A sliitable reactive derivative of an acid is, for example, an acyl halide, for example an acyl chloride formed by the reaction of the<br><br>
acid and an inorganic acid chloride, for example thionyl chloride; a mixed anhydride, for example an anhydride formed by the reaction of the acid and a chloroformate slich as isoblityl chloroformate; an active ester, for example an ester formed by the reaction of the acid and a phenol slich as pentaflliorophenol; an active ester formed by the reaction of the acid and N-hydroxybenzotriazole; an acyl azide, for example an azide formed by the reaction of the acid and an azide slich as diphenylphosphoryl azide; an acyl cyanide, for example a cyanide formed by the reaction of an acid and a cyanide slich as diethylphosphoryl cyanide; or the prodlict of the reaction of the acid and a carbodiimide slich as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, or the prodlict of the reaction of the add and bis-(2-oxo-3-oxazolidinyl)-phosphorylchloride. The reaction is carried olit between -30°C and 60°C5 conveniently at or below 0°C. In the second step, compolind VI is added to the sollition, at the temperatlire lised for the activation, and the temperatlire is slowly adjlisted to ambient temperatlire. These methods are well known to those skilled in the art. In principle, all methods for the synthesis of amides as lised in peptide chemistry as described in e.g. "Methoden der organischen Chemie (Holiben-Weyl)" Vol. XV/1 and XV/2 are also applicable.<br>
Compolinds of the formlila V are prepared from compolinds of the formlila II by hydrolysis. The conditions under which the hydrolysis is carried olit depend on the natlire of the grolip R3. When R3 is a methyl or ethyl grolip, the reaction is carried olit in the presence of a base, for example, lithium hydroxide, sodilim hydroxide, or potassilim hydroxide in an inert solvent or dillient, for example, in methanol or ethanol. When R3 is the tert.blityl grolip, the reaction is carried olit in the presence of an add, for example, a sollition of hydrochloric acid in an inert solvent slich as diethyl ether or dioxane, or trifllioroacetic acid in dichloromethane. When R3 is the benzyl grolip, the reaction is carried olit by hydrogenolysis in the presence of a noble metal catalyst slich as palladilim or platinlim on a sliitable carrier, slich as carbon. Not necessarily all methods of hydrolysis are compatible with all grolips Rl or R2. In cases where the featlires of these grolips do not allow the lisage of a certain method of hydrolysis, other methods of preparation need to be applied.<br>
(c) Another preferred method for the preparation of compolinds of the formlila I is the reaction of a compolind of the formlila V with hydroxylamine. This reaction typically involves a two-step one-pot procedlire. In the first step, the carboxylate of the formlila V becomes activated. This reaction is carried olit in an inert solvent or dillient, for example, in dichloromethane, dioxane, or tetrahydrofliran, in the<br><br>
presence of an activating agent. A sliitable reactive derivative of an acid is, for example, an acyl halide, for example an acyl chloride formed by the reaction of the acid and an inorganic acid chloride, for example thionyl chloride; a mixed anhydride, for example an anhydride formed by the reaction of the acid and a chloroformate slich as isoblityl chloroformate; an active ester, for example an ester formed by the reaction of the acid and a phenol slich as pentaflliorophenol; an active ester formed by the reaction of the add and N-hydroxybenzotriazole; an acyl azide, for example an azide formed by the reaction of the acid and an azide slich as diphenylphosphoryl azide; an acyl cyanide, for example a cyanide formed by the reaction of an acid and a cyanide slich as diethylphosphoryl cyanide; or the prodlict of the reaction of the acid and a carbodiimide slich as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, or the prodlict of the reaction of the acid and bis-(2-oxo-3-oxazolidinyl)-phosphorylchloride. The reaction is carried olit between -30°C and 60°C, conveniently at or below 0°C. In the second step, hydroxylamine is added to the sollition, at the temperatlire lised for the activation, and the temperatlire is slowly adjlisted to ambient temperatlire. These methods are well known to those skilled in the art. In principle, all methods for the synthesis of amides as lised in peptide chemistry as described in e.g. "Methoden der organischen Chemie (Holiben-Weyl)" Vol. XV/1 and XV/2 are also applicable.<br>
(d) Compolinds of formlila I can also be prepared with methods of solid phase slipported synthesis. Terephthalic acid or 2,5-thiophenedicarboxylic acid is reacted with a hydroxylamine moiety (-O-NH2) bolind to a resin, e.g. a Wang resin (Wang-O-NH2 resin was slipplied by EMC microcollections, Tlibingen) to form a resin-bolind hydroxamic acid. The second carbonic acid moiety is reacted with an amine by standard methods of amide formation as described in e.g. "Methoden der organischen Chemie (Holiben-Weyl)" Vol. XV/1 and XV/2. After this, the hydroxamic acid is liberated from the solid slipport. This can be done for example with TFA. The crlide prodlict can be plirified by LC-MS, if necessary.<br>

Evalliation of effects on a hliman colon carninoma cell line of the compolinds of<br>
the invention<br>
MTT is widely lised for the qliantitative determination of cytotoxic effects or in vitro chemosensitivity of tlimor cells. The assay is based on the cleavage of the yellow tetrazolilim salt MTT to plirple formazan crystals by metabolic active cells. For details, see Rlibinstein, L.V., et al., J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 82 (1990) 1113-1118.<br>
The following procedlire was performed: HT-29 cells (hliman colon carcinoma cell line) were cliltivated in RPM 1640, 2.5 % PCS, 2 mM Gllitamine, 100 li/ml Penicillin, 100 lig/ml Streptomycin. For the assay the cells were seeded in 384 well plates, 900 cells per well, in the same medilim The next day compolinds (dissolved 10 mM in DMSO) were added in variolis concentrations ranging from 30 liM to 1.5 nM. After 5 days the MTT assay was done mainly according to the instrlictions of the manlifactlirer (Cell proliferation kit I, MTT, fom Roche Moleclilar Biochemicals). In brief: MTT labeling reagent was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml, added and inclibated for 4 hrs at 37 C, 5% C02. Dliring this inclibation time plirple formazan crystals are formed. After addition of the sollibilization sollition (20% SDS in 0.02 M HCl) the plates were inclibated overnight at 37 C, 5% C02. After careflil mixing plates were measlired in Victor 2 (scanning mliltiweli spectrophotometer, Wallac) at 550 nm.<br>
A decrease in nlimber of living cells reslilts in a decrease in the total metabolic activity in the sample. The decrease direcdy correlates to the amolint of plirple cololir reslilting from the sollibilization of the plirple formazan crystals. Determination of IC50 was done lising XL-fit.<br><br><br>
