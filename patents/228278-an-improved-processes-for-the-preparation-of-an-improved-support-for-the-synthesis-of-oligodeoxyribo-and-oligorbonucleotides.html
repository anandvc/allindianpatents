				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of an improved support for the synthesis of oligodeoxyribonucleotides and oligoribonucleotides. The polymer support containing an organic molecule having a cis-diol group where one hydroxyl group is attached via a covalent linkage and the other hydroxyl group is protected by an acid labile group. The process also rexates to the cleavage of  oligo-deoxyribo-  and  oligoribonucleotides from the. universal  support  and simultaneously  removal  of  protecting groups  from  exocyclic  amino functionalities  of nucleic bases and (2-cyanoethyl from  internucleo-tidic phosphate functions.    The  improved universal polymer  support of  formula II accompanying the specifications wherein  P   represents a polymer support  bearing aminoalkyl  or hydroxyl functionalities and R  stands  for  an organic substance bearing a pair  of  cis  hydroxyl groups where one of the hydroxyl function is coupled to aminoalkyl  or hydroxyl function via a succinate linkage. The other hydroxyl function of the organic substance was protected with monomethoxytrityl or 4,4'-dimethoxytrityl chloride.  The support was employed for the  synthesis of  oligodeoxyribo- and oligoribonucleotides in an automated DNA  synthesizer following phosphoramidite chemistry. The cleavage of oligonucleotide from the support and  other protecting groups were removed in analogous way to the standard method.<br>
The known protecting groups of formula I, shown in the drawing accompanying the specification represented by figure I, employed, viz., conventional (set I) and labile (set II -IV) for exocyclic amino protection in nucleosides, are described below.<br>
Set I (Conventional Protecting Group)<br>
B = Adenine;	R = Benzoyl (Bz)<br>
B = Cytosine;	R = Benzoyl ( Bz) or acetyl (Ac)<br><br>
B = Guanine;   R = Isobutyryl (Ibu) Set II(Labile Protecting Group)<br>
B = Adenine;  R = Phenoxyacetyl (Pac) B = Cytosine; R = Isobutyryl (Ibu) or Acetyl(Ac) B = Guanine;  R = Phenoxyacetyl (Pac) Set III(Labile Protecting Group)<br>
B = Adenine;  R = Dimethylformamidine (DMF) B = Cytosine; R = Dimethylformamidine (DMF) B = Guanine;  R = Dimethylformamidine (DMF) Set IV(Labile Protecting Group)<br>
B = Adenine; R = p-tert-Butylphenoxyacetyl B = Cytosine; R = p-tert-Butylphenoxyacetyl B = Guanine; R = p-tert-Butylphenoxyacetyl Synthetic oligonucleotides (oligodeoxyribo- and oligoribonucleo-tide) have become indispensable tools in modern biological sciences. The protocols for chemical synthesis and modifications of these molecules have been simplified to an extent that even a non-chemist, the actual user can synthesize these molecules without much difficulties. However, the support functionalization has been one of the time consuming tasks. Moreover, one still requires to use at least eight different (four for oligodeoxyribo- and four for oligoribonucleotides) supports, each bearing a separate nucleoside corresponding to the 3'-terminus of the desired oligomer. This number may even be more when 3'-terminus of the desired oligomer contains nucleotide other than the normal one. Though the time of functionalization of polymer supports required for oligonucleotide synthesis has been reduced considerably in the recent publications (Kumar et al., Nucleosides and Nucleotides,<br><br>
15, 1996, 879), one still needs at least eight different supports for all kinds of oligonucleotides. Some attempts have been made to develop universal supports to eliminate the use of eight different supports. Gough et al. (Gough et al., Tet. Lett. 24, 1983, 5321) have proposed the use of a single universal support that consisted of controlled pore glass derivatized with 2'(3')-O-benzoyluridine 5'-0-succinyl residue and demonstrated its applications for the synthesis of oligodeoxyribo- and oligoribonucleotides via phosphotriester or the<br>
phosphite approach.   The cleavage of oligodeoxyribo- and oligoribonu-<br>
o cleotides  was effected by the use of aq. ammonia for 24h  at  60-65 C<br>
o and aq. ammonia-pyridine (2:1) for 16h at 50 C, respectively in sealed<br>
vials. The universal support contains a nucleosidic material which does not get incorporated in the oligonucleotide chain and goes waste. The other serious limitations of this support are that the deprotection time is considerably longer in comparison to the time required in the standard protocol and the functinalization of the support involves multistep (4 steps) synthesis and purification procedure. In a recent publication, they (Gough et al., Tet. Lett., 36, 1995, 27) have further modified the functinalization of the universal support by the use of an adapter, 2'(3')-0-benzoyluridine-5'-0-(cya-noethyl- N,N-diisopropylphosphoramidite) and coupled it to a standard T-support, following phosphoramidite chemistry. The functionalized support was subsequently used for the synthesis of oligonucleotides. The  deprotection  of  oligodeoxyribo-  and  oligoribonucleotides  was<br>
achieved  by the treatment of the support with 25 ml aq.  ammonia  for<br>
o 48h  at 65 C  in a pressure vial and  25 ml aq. ammonia-pyridine  mix-<br>
o tare  (4:1,  v/v) for 24h at 50 C  in a pressure  vial,  respectively.<br>
However, the universal support has still the following serious limita-<br><br>
tions: The support contains two nucleosidic units (expensive material) which do not get incorporated in the oligonucleotide chain and wasted. The adapter used for the functionalization of universal support involves multistep synthesis and purification strategy and yield of the final product is low, making the support functionalization a time consuming (2-3d), tedious and expensive task. Moreover, the time required for the deprotection of oligonucleotides is exhorbitantly high, almost three times to the time required in currently followed synthesis and deprotection protocol. In fact the time required for the deprotection of oligonucleotides is so much that one can afford to prepare all the eight different supports even in lesser time. In an elegant study Gough and co-workers described that an oligodeoxynucleotide having 3'-terminal protection with a ribonucleo-side linked by its 2'- or 3'-hydroxyl group to a 3'-phosphate is removed as its 2',3'-cyclic phosphate by lead cation. In this process oligodeoxynucleotide gets removed with 3'-hydroxyl function. This concept led Gough and co-workers developing two universal supports. Both of the universal, supports contain uridine as the terminal ribonucleoside providing a pair of cis-diol groups. Because of the rigid rotation of these hydroxy1 groups, oligodeoxyribo- and oligori-bonucleotides take considerable time (48h) for the cleavage from the universal supports. This problem might be taken care of if uridine, a source of cis diol groups is replaced by an organic molecule providing a pair of cis diol groups with free rotation. The free rotation of cis diol groups will help in rapid formation of cyclic phosphate in the presence of lead cation or alkaline conditions and hence will lead in rapid deprotection of oligodeoxyribo- and oligoribonucleotides from<br><br>
the universal support.<br>
Therefore, there is a need to develop a universal support suitable for the synthesis of oligodeoxyribo- and oligoribonucleotides and compatible to the existing methods of synthesis and deprotection (cleavage of oligodeoxyribo- and oligoribonucleotides from the universal support and simultaneously removal of protecting groups, labile or conventional from exocyclic amino functionalities of nucleic bases and (2-cyanoethyl from internucleotidic phosphate functions) of all possible oligodeoxyribo- and oligoribonucleotides.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is therefore  to provide  an improved process for the preparation of  an  improved universal  polymer  support  for the synthesis  of oligodeoxyribo- and oligoribonucleotides.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of an improved universal polymer support devoid of any nucleosidic material, suitable for the synthesis of all possible  oligodeoxyribo- and oligoribonucleotides<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of an improved universal polymer support compatible to the existing methodologies of synthesis and deprotection (cleavage of oligodeoxyribo- and oligoribonucleotides from the universal support and simultaneously removal of protecting groups, labile or conventional from exocyclic amino functionalities of nucleic bases and (2-cyanoethyl from internucleotidic phosphate functions) of all possible oligodeoxyribo- and oligoribonucleotides.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of an  improved universal polymer  support<br><br>
employing commonly available reagents.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of<br>
an    improved    support   for   the   synthesis   of   oligodeoxyribonucleotides    and<br>
oligoribonucleotides which comprises:<br>

The following examples concerning the use of universal support for the synthesis of oligodeoxynucleotides and oligoribonucleotides and the cleavage of oligodeoxyribo- and oligoribonucleotides from the universal support and simultaneously removal of protecting groups (conventional and labile) from exocyclic amino functionalities of nucleic bases and (2-cyanoethyl from internucleotidic phosphate functions are provided to illustrate the invention and should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention. Example 1<br>
The preparation of universal support comprises of two steps which are described below. In a 25 ml round bottomed flask, dl-butan-2,3-diol (5 mmol) was dried by coevaporation with pyridine (15 ml) and finally suspended in anhydrous pyridine (15 ml).  4,4'-Dimethoxytrityl<br><br>
chloride (2 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture was left for stirring at room, temperature. After 5h, 5% aq. sodium hydrogen carbonate (2 ml) was added and stirred for further 10 min. Then the reaction mixture was concentrated on a rotary evaporator and the syrupy material so obtained was redissolved in ethyl acetate (70 ml) and washed with aq. sodium hydrogen carbonate solution (2 x 25 ml) and water (1 x 25 ml), respectively. The organic layer was collected, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, concentrated and dried on an evaporator under reduced pressure to obtain, 2(3)-(4,4'-dimethaxytri-tyl)-butan-3(2)-diol, in 90% yield and fully characterized by its NMR, IR and MS spectra.<br>
In the second step, 2(3)-(4,4'-dimethoxytrityl)-butan-3(2)-diol was attached to the long chain aminoalkylated controlled pore glass (LCAA-CPG) by following procedure. Succinoyl chloride (6.3 (1, 0.05 mmol) was added to a solution of triazole (19.8 mg, 0.28 mmol) in an anhydrous mixture of pyridine (500(1) and acetonitrile (1.0 ml) taken in a septum sealed vial. To the solution was injected 2(3)~(4,4'-dimethoxytrityl)-butan-3(2)-diol (0.05 mmol) in acetonitrile (1 ml). The reaction mixture was agitated at room temperature for lh and then LCAA-CPG (200 mg) added and agitation continued at room temperature. After 15 min., the contents of the vial were transferred to sintered disc glass funnel, excess reagent washed off, residual triazolosucci-nyl groups on the polymer support were capped with anhydrous methanol (1 ml). After washing with dry acetonitrile (3x5 ml), residual amino groups were blocked following standard procedure (Matteucci, M.D. and Caruthers, M.H., J.Am.Chem.Soc., 103 (1981) 3185). The polymer support so  obtained was used for oligonucleotide synthesis.  The  synthesized<br><br>
oligomers  from the support and protecting groups from  nucleic  bases<br>
and phosphate groups were removed by the treatment of ag. ammonia  for<br>
o 16h  at 60 C. The fully deprotected oligomers were compared  with<br>
oligomers  synthesized on standard supports on HPLC,  FPLC  (Fast<br>
protein liguid chematography) and by biological activity.<br>
Example 2<br>
In a 25 ml round bottomed flask, d-butan-2,3-diol (5 mmol) was dried by coevaporation with pyridine (15 ml) and finally suspended in anhydrous pyridine (15 ml). 4,4'-Dimethoxytrityl chloride (2 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture was left for stirring at room temperature. After 5h, 5% ag . sodium hydrogen carbonate (2 ml) was added and stirred for further 10 min. Then the reaction mixture was concentrated on a rotary evaporator and the syrupy material so obtained was redissolved in ethyl acetate (70 ml) and washed with ag. sodium hydrogen carbonate solution (2 x 25 ml) and water (1 x 25 ml), respectively. The organic layer was collected, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, concentrated and dried on an evaporator under reduced pressure to obtain, 2(3)-(4,4'-dimethoxytrityl)-butan-3(2)-diol, in 85% yield and fully characterized by its  NMR, IR and MS spectra.<br>
The  compound, 2(3)-(4,4'-dimethoxytrityl)-butan-3(2)-diol,  (0.1<br>
mmol) was reacted with succinic anhydride (0.2 mmol) in dichloroethane<br>
(4  ml)  in the presence of 4-dimethyIaminopyridine (50  umol)  and  a<br>
o<br>
tertiary  base,  triethylamine (0.1 mmol) at 50 C for  20  min.  After<br>
stipulated time (20 min), the reaction mixture was diluted with dichloroethane (25 ml) and washed with 5% cold ag. citric acid (2x 15 ml) and water (2x 10 ml), respectively. The organic phase was collected and concentrated to obtain 2-(4,4'-dimethoxytrityloxy)-l-methylpro-pyl-succinate in 93% yield. 2-(4,4'dimethoxytrityloxy)-1-methylpropyl-<br><br>
succinate  (0.05  mmol)  and 4-dimethylaminopyridine  (10  umol)  were<br>
dissolved  in pyridine (2 ml) and added LCAA-CPG (200 mg) followed  by<br>
dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (0.075 mmol) under anhydrous conditions.  The<br>
resulting mixture was shaken occasionally at room temperature for 16h.<br>
Then  the mixture was transferred to a sintered disc glass funnel  and<br>
washed off the excess reagents with pyridine (1 x 10 ml), methanol  (3<br>
x  15 ml) and diethylether (2 x 10 ml). The washed support  was  dried<br>
under  vacuum  and  capped the residual amino groups  on  the  polymer<br>
support  following  standard procedure. The  resulting  functionalized<br>
support was  used oligonucleotide synthesis using  labile  protecting<br>
groups containing nucleoside phosphoramidite. The cleavage of oligomer<br>
chain from the support and removal of protecting groups were  achieved<br>
o by  aq. ammonia (29%) treatment for 6h at 60 C. The fully  deprotected<br>
oligomers were desalted and analyzed on HPLC and FPLC. Then the oligomers were compared with the standard oligomers synthesized on the commercially available conventional polymer supports. They were found to be identical in all respect, viz., retention times on HPLC as well as UV pattern. Example 3<br>
In a 25 ml round bottomed flask, l-butan-2,3-diol (5 mmol) was dried by coevaporation with pyridine (15 ml) and finally suspended in anhydrous pyridine (15 ml). 4,4'-Dimethoxytrityl chloride (2 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture was left for stirring at room temperature. After 5h, 5% aq. sodium hydrogen carbonate (2 ml) was added and stirred for further 10 min. Then the reaction mixture was concentrated on a rotary evaporator and the syrupy material so obtained was  redissolved in ethyl acetate (70 ml) and washed with.  aq.  sodium<br><br>
hydrogen carbonate solution (2 x 25 ml) and water (1 x 25 ml), respectively. The organic layer was collected, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, concentrated and dried on an evaporator under reduced pressure to obtain, 2(3)-(4,4'-dimethoxytrityl)-butan-3(2)-diol, in 88% yield and fully characterized fay its  NMR, IR and MS spectra.<br>
In  the  next  reaction,  2(3)-(4,4'-dimethoxytrityl)-butan-3(2)-dial,  (0.1  mmol) was reacted with succinic anhydride (0.2  mmol)  in<br>
dichloroethane (4 ml) in the presence of  4-dimethylaminopyridine<br>
o (0.05 mmol) and a tertiary basts, triethylamine (0.1 mmol) at 50 C<br>
for 20 min. After stipulated time, the reaction mixture was diluted with dichloroethane (25 ml) and washed, with 5% cold aq. citric acid (2 x 15 ml) and water (2 x 10 ml), respectively. The organic phase was collected and concentrated to obtain 2-(4,4'-dimethoxytrityloxy)-1-methyl- propylsuccinate in 93% yield. To the mixture of 2-(4,4'-dimethoxytrityloxy)-1- methylpropylsucci-nate (0.05 mmol), 2,2'-dithiobis(5-nitropyridine) (DTNP) (0.05 mmol) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (0.05 mmol) dissolved in acetonitrile : dichloroethane (3:1, v/v, 2 ml) was added a solution of triphenylphosphine (0.05 mmol) in acetonitrile (0.5 ml) followed by addition of LCAA-CPG (250 mg) . The resulting mixture was shaken occasionally at room temperature for 3 0 min. Then the mixture was transferred to a sintered disc glass funnel and washed off the excess reagents with acetonitrile (1 x 10 ml), dichloroethane (3 x 10 ml), methanol (3 x 15 ml) and diethylether (2 x 10 ml). The washed support was dried under vacuum and blocked the residual amino groups on the polymer support with acetic anhydride. The resulting functionalized support was used oligoribonucleotide synthesis. The cleavage of oligomer from  the<br><br>
support and removal of protecting groups from nucleic bases and internucleotidic phosphates were carried out by methylamine solution (2 ml) treatment at room temperature for 90 min. The deprotected oligoribonucleotides were analyzed on HPLC and compared with the oligoribonucleotide synthesized and deprotected from a conventional polymer support. Both the oligomers were found to be identical with respect to their retention times on HPLC. Example 4<br>
In a 25 ml round bottomed flask, d-butan-2,3-diol (5 mmol) was dried by coevaporation with pyridine (15 ml) and finally suspended in anhydrous pyridine (15 ml). 4,4'-Dimethoxytrityl chloride (2 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture was left for stirring at room temperature. After 5h, 5% aq. sodium hydrogen carbonate (2 ml) was added and stirred for further 10 min. Then the reaction mixture was concentrated on a rotary evaporator and the syrupy material so obtained was redissolved in ethyl acetate (70 ml) and washed with aq. sodium hydrogen carbonate solution (2 x 25 ml) and water (1 x 25 ml), respectively. The organic layer was collected, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, concentrated and dried on an evaporator under reduced pressure to obtain, 2(3)-(4,4'-dimethoxytrityl)-butan-3(2)-diol, in 85% yield and fully characterized by its  NMR, IR and MS spectra.<br>
The next step was carried out with slight modification. LCAA-CPG (500 mg) was activated with 3% trichloroacetic acid (20 ml) in dich-loromethane for 3h at room temperature followed by washings with dichloroethane (2 x 50 ml), triethylamine : diisopropylethylamine (1 : If  v/v,  50 ml) and diethylether (1 x 25 ml). Then  the  support  was<br><br>
dried in a vacuum desiccator.  To the suspension of LCAA-CPG (250  mg)<br>
in dry dichloroethane (3 ml) was added succinic anhydride (0.25 mmol),<br>
triethylamine (0.05 mmol) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (0.025 mmol) for<br>
o 5h  at 55 C. Then it was filtered and excess of reagents were  removed<br>
with dichloroethane (3 x 20 ml), methanol (2 x 20 ml) and diethylether (2 x 15 ml) followed by drying under vacuum. 2(3)-(4,4'-dimethoxytri-tyl)-butan-3(2)-diol (0.05 mmol) was mixed with 4-dimethylaminopyridine (0.05 mmol), l-( 3-dimethylaminopropyl) ethylcarbodiimi.de (0.25 mmol) and succinylated LCAA-CPG (200 mg) in pyridine (2 ml) and triethylamine (30 mmol). The flask was tightly sealed and shaken at room temperature for 16h. Pentafluorophenol (0.05 mmol) was added and shaking was continued for another 16h. Then piperidine (500 (mol) was added, shaken for 5 min and filtered off the support. It was washed with dichloromethane (2 x 20 ml) and diethylether (2 x 10 ml). After drying under vacuum, the residual amino groups were capped with acetic anhydride using standard procedure. Finally the support so obtained was used for synthesis of oligonucleotides. Cleavage from the support of oligonucleotides and removal of protecting groups were carried out by using aq. ammonia - methylamine (1:1, v/v, 2 ml) for 75 min at room temperature. The fully deprotected oligomers were desalted and analyzed on HPLC followed by comparison with standard oligomers. They were found to be identical in all respect (HPLC elution and UV pattern ) . Example 5<br>
In a 25 ml round bottomed flask, dl-butan-2,3-diol (5 mmol) was dried by coevaporation with pyridine (15 ml) and finally suspended in anhydrous dichloroethane (15 ml). 4,4'-Dimethoxytrityl chloride (2 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture was left for stirring at room<br><br>
temperature. After 5h, 5% aq. sodium hydrogen carbonate (2 ml) was added and stirred for further 10 min. Then the reaction mixture was washed with aq. sodium hydrogen carbonate solution (2 x 25 ml) and water (1x25 ml), respectively. The organic layer was collected, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, concentrated and dried on an evaporator under reduced pressure to obtain, 2(3)-(4,4'-dimethoxytrityl)-butan-3(2)-diol, in 87% yield and fully characterized by its NMR, IR and MS spectra.<br>
After accomplishing the first step, the second step was carried out as follows. Oxalyl chloride (8.7 (1, 0.1 mmol) was added to a solution of triazole (35 mg, 0.5 mmol) in an anhydrous mixture of pyridine (1 ml) and acetonitrile (5.0 ml) taken in a septum sealed vial. To the solution was added 2(3)-(4,4'-dimethoxytrityl)-butan-3(2)-diol (0.1 mmol) in acetonitrile (3 ml). The reaction mixture was agitated at room temperature for Ih and then LCAA-CPG (300 mg) added and agitation continued at room temperature. After 15 min., the contents of the vial were transferred to sintered disc glass funnel, excess reagent washed off, residual triazolosuccinyl groups on the polymer support were capped with anhydrous methanol (5 mi). After washing with dry acetonitrile (3 x 25 ml), residual amino groups were blocked following standard procedure. The polymer support so obtained was used directly for oligonucleotide synthesis using labile protecting groups containing phosphoramidites. The synthesized oligomers were<br>
cleaved from the support and protecting groups from nucleic bases  and<br>
o phosphate  groups  removed by using aq. ammonia for 2h  at  60 C.  The<br>
fully  deprotected  oligomers were compared  with  standard  oligomers<br>
synthesized  on conventional supports and found to be  identical  with<br><br>
respect to their retention tim.es on HPLC and FPLC. Example 5<br>
In the first step, dl-butan-2,3-diol (5 mmol) was dried by coe-vaporation with pyridine (15 ml) and finally suspended in anhydrous acetonitrile (15 ml). 4,4'-Dimethoxytrityl chloride (2 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture was left for stirring at room temperature. After 5h, 5% aq. sodium hydrogen carbonate (2 ml) was added and stirred for further 10 min. Then the reaction mixture was concentrated on a rotary evaporator and the syrupy material so obtained was redissolved in ethyl acetate (70 ml) and washed with aq. sodium hydrogen carbonate solution (2 x 25 ml) and water (1 x 25 ml), respectively. The organic layer was collected, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, concentrated and dried on an evaporator under reduced pressure to obtain, 2(3)-(4,4'-dimethoxytrityl)-butan-3(2)-diol, in 83% yield and fully characterized by its  NMR, IR and MS spectra.<br>
The second step was carried out as follows. Oxalyl chloride (8.7 (1, 0.1 mmol) was added to a solution of triazole (35 mg, 0.5 mmol) in an anhydrous mixture of pyridine (1 ml) and acetonitrile (5.0 ml) taken in a septum sealed vial. To the solution was added 2(3)-(4,4'-dimethoxytrityl)-butan-3(2)-dioI (0.1 mmol) in acetonitrile (3 ml). The reaction mixture was agitated at room temperature for Ih and then LCAA-CPG (300 mg) added and agitation continued at room temperature. After 15 min., the contents of the vial were transferred to sintered disc glass funnel, excess reagent washed off, residual triazolosucci-nyl groups on the polymer support were capped with anhydrous methanol (5 ml). After washing with dry acetonitrile (3 x 25 ml), residual amino groups were blocked following standard procedure. The polymer support so obtained was used directly for oligoribonucleotide  synthe-<br><br>
sis. The synthesized oligoribomers were cleaved from the support and protecting groups from nucleic bases and phosphate groups removed by using methylamine solution (2 ml) for 90 min at room temperature. The fully deprotected oligoribomers were compared with the standard oligoribomers and found to be identical in all respects, viz., UV pattern, retention times on HPLC and FPLC. Example 6<br>
In the first step, l-butan-2,3-diol (5 mmol) was dried by coe-vaporation with pyridine (15 ml) and finally suspended in anhydrous acetonitrile (15 ml). 4,4'-Dimethoxytrityl chloride (2 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture was left for stirring at room temperature. After 5h, 5% ag. sodium hydrogen carbonate (2 ml) was added and stirred for further 10 min. Then the reaction mixture was concentrated on a rotary evaporator and the syrupy material so obtained was redissolved in ethyl acetate (70 ml) and washed with ag. sodium hydrogen carbonate solution (2 x 25 ml) and water (1 x 25 ml), respectively. The organic layer was collected, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, concentrated and dried on an evaporator under reduced pressure to obtain, 2(3)-(4,4'-dimethoxytrityl)-butan-3(2)-diol, in 86% yield and fully characterized by its  NMR, IR and MS spectra.<br>
After accomplishing the first step, succinoyl chloride (8.7 (1, 0.1 mmol) was added to a solution of triazole (35 mg, 0.5 mmol) in an anhydrous mixture of pyridine (1 ml) and acetonitrile (5.0 ml) taken in a septum sealed vial. To the solution was added 2(3)-(4,4'-dimethoxytrityl )-butan-3 ( 2 )-diol (0.1 mmol) in acetonitrile (3 ml).
