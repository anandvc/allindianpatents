				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR TRANSMITTING AND RECEIVING<br>
UPLINK CHANNEL SOUNDING REFERENCE SIGNALS IN A<br>
WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a Frequency Division Multiple<br>
Access (FDMA)-based wireless communication system, and in particular, to a<br>
method and apparatus for transmitting and receiving Channel Sounding Reference<br>
Signals (CS RS).<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
Recently, in mobile communication systems, intensive research has been<br>
conducted on Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) or<br>
Single Carrier - Frequency Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA) as a scheme<br>
suitable for high-speed data transmission in wireless channels.<br>
Presently, the OFDM and SC-FDMA technologies are applied in the<br>
downlink and uplink of the Evolved UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access (EUTRA)<br>
standard based on Universal Mobile Telecommunication Services (UMTS)<br>
defined by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).<br>
SC-FDMA, a technology that is based on single-carrier transmission<br>
while guaranteeing orthogonality between multiple access users like OFDM, is<br>
advantageous in that a Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) of transmission<br>
signals is very low. Therefore, SC-FDMA, when it is applied to the mobile<br>
communication system, can bring improvement of the cell coverage due to its low<br>
PAPR, compared to the OFDM technology.<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates a structure of a general SC-FDMA transmitter and a slot<br>
structure, in which Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) 103 and Inverse Fast Fourier<br>
Transform (IFFT) 105 are used.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, a difference between OFDM and SC-FDMA will be<br>
considered in terms of the transmitter structure. Aside from IFFT 105 used for<br>
multi-carrier transmission in an OFDM transmitter, FFT 103 further exists in<br>
front of the IFFT 105 in an SC-FDMA transmitter. Here, M modulation symbols<br>
100 constitute one block, and the block is input to the FFT 103 with a size M.<br>
Each of the blocks will be referred to herein as a 'Long Block (LB)', and 7 LBs<br>
constitute one 0.5-ms slot 102.<br>
Signals output from the FFT 103 are applied to the IFFT 105 as inputs<br>
having consecutive indexes (See 104), where the signals undergo inverse Fourier<br>
transform, and then are converted into an analog signal (See 106) before being<br>
transmitted. An input/output size N of the IFFT 105 is greater than an input/output<br>
size M of the FFT 103. The SC-FDMA transmission signal has a lower PAPR<br>
than the OFDM signal because the signal processed by means of the FFT 103 and<br>
IFFT 105 has single-carrier characteristics.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates exemplary resource partitioning in the frequency-time<br>
domain in a EUTRA SC-FDMA system.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, a system bandwidth 201 is 10 MHz, and a total of 50<br>
Resource Units (RUs) 202 exist in the system bandwidth 201. Each RU 202 is<br>
composed of 12 subcarriers 203, can have 14 LBs 204, and is a basic scheduling<br>
unit for data transmission. The 14 LBs 204 constitute one 1-ms subframe 205.<br>
FIG. 3 is a diagram illustrating resource allocation for transmission of a<br>
control channel and a data channel in the EUTRA uplink based on the resource<br>
partitioning structure of FIG. 2.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, control information, such as ACKnowledge<br>
(ACK)/Negative ACK (NACK) representative of response signals for a Hybrid<br>
Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ) operation for downlink data and Channel<br>
Quality Indication (CQI) representative of channel state information for downlink<br>
data scheduling, is transmitted through the RUs located in both ends, i.e., RU#1<br>
and RU#50 of the system band. Meanwhile, information such as data, Random<br>
Access CHannel (RACH) and other control channels, is transmitted through the<br>
RUs located in the middle 302 of the system band, i.e., all RUs except for RU#1<br>
and RU#50.<br>
Control information transmitted in the first slot 308 of RU#1 is repeatedly<br>
transmitted through RU#50 311 in the next slot by frequency hopping, thereby<br>
obtaining frequency diversity gain. Similarly, control information transmitted<br>
using the first slot 309 of RU#50 is repeatedly transmitted through RU#1 310 in<br>
the next slot by frequency hopping. Meanwhile, several control channels are<br>
transmitted in one RU after undergoing Code Domain Multiplexing (CDM).<br>
FIG. 4 illustrates the detailed CDM structure for control channels.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, ACK CHannel (ACKCH)#1 and ACKCH#2 allocated<br>
to different terminals transmit their associated ACK/NACK signals using the<br>
same Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequence at every LB. Symbols of a ZC sequence 412<br>
applied to ACKCH#1 are transmitted in an order of S1, s2, •••, S12 at every LB, and<br>
symbols of a ZC sequence 414 applied to ACKCH#2 are transmitted in an order<br>
of s3, s4, —, S12, S1, s2. That is, the ZC sequence applied to ACKCH#2 is cyclic-<br>
shifted from the ZC sequence of ACKCH#1 by 2 symbols (? (Delta) = 2 symbols).<br>
ZC sequences having different cyclic shift values '0' 408 and ? (Delta) 410<br>
according to the ZC sequence characteristics having mutual orthogonality. By<br>
setting a difference between the cyclic shift values 408 and 410 to a value greater<br>
than the maximum transmission delay of a wireless transmission path, it is<br>
possible to maintain orthogonality between channels.<br>
Corresponding ZC sequences of ACKCH#1 and ACKCH#2 are<br>
multiplied by ACK/NACK symbols b1 and b2 desired to be transmitted at every<br>
LB, respectively. Due to the orthogonality between the ZC sequences, even<br>
though ACKCH#1 and ACKCH#2 are transmitted at the same time in the same<br>
RU, a base station's receiver can detect the ACK/NACK symbols bi and b2 of two<br>
channels without mutual interference. At LBs 405 and 406 located in the middle<br>
of a slot, Reference Signals (RSs) for channel estimation are transmitted during<br>
detection of the ACK/NACK symbols. Like the control information of ACKCH#1<br>
and ACKCH#2, the RS is also transmitted after undergoing CDM by means of its<br>
corresponding ZC sequence. In FIG. 4, b1 and b2 are repeated over several LBs, in<br>
order to enable even the terminal located in the cell boundary to transmit an<br>
ACK/NACK signal of sufficient power to the base station.<br>
According to a similar principle, even the CQI channel transmits one<br>
modulation symbol at every LB, and different CQI channels can undergo CDM<br>
using ZC sequences having different cyclic shift values.<br>
FIG. 5 illustrates a structure where five control channels 500-504 are<br>
multiplexed in one RU for a 0.5-ms slot.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, there are shown two ACK Channels, ACKCH#1 500<br>
and ACKCH#2 501, employing coherent modulation; and three control channels<br>
of Non-Coherent Signaling Control CHannels (NCCCH)#1 502, #2 503 and #3<br>
504 for transmitting 1-bit control information using a non-coherent modulation<br>
scheme. ACKCH#1 500 and ACKCH#2 502 transmit RS signals for channel<br>
estimation at the 2nd and 6th LBs (hereinafter, "RS LBs") 511 and 512 (513 and<br>
514), respectively, and transmit ACK/NACK symbols 515 at the remaining LBs<br>
(hereinafter, "control information LBs"). NCCCHs 502, 503 and 504 transmit<br>
only the control information at the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 7th LBs.<br>
ACKCH#1 500 and ACKCH#2 501 apply the same cyclic shift value A<br>
(shift of ZC) 510 to ZC sequences transmitted at each LB. Therefore, the same<br>
cyclic shift value A (shift of ZC) 510 is applied between the two channels 500 and<br>
501 even at LBs 511-514 for transmission of RS signals.<br>
For orthogonal detection of ACK/NACK symbols bi and b2 transmitted in<br>
the two channels 500 and 501, the signals multiplexed to ZC sequences of<br>
ACKCH#1 500 and ACKCH#2 501 are multiplied by sequence symbols of<br>
length-N orthogonal sequences Sm,n 516 (where n denotes a sequence symbol<br>
index, for n=l, ...., N) with different indexes m in units of LBs. For instance, a<br>
Fourier sequence defined as Equation (1) can be applied as the orthogonal<br>
sequence.<br><br>
The Fourier sequence satisfies mutual orthogonality between sequences<br>
with different indexes m, and N=5 in the structure shown in FIG. 5. Aside from<br>
the Fourier sequence, other length-5 sequences such as ZC and Generalized<br>
Chirp-Like (GCL) sequences can also be used as the orthogonal sequence.<br>
Wherein, length-5 sequence means that it can be expressed ,for example, 10101,<br>
11011, etc. In other words, 5-length sequence is like 5-bit sequence. So it has not<br>
the unit of measurements. If it should have the unit, it can be said as 5-bit length.<br>
In the example of FIG. 5, symbols of length-5 sequences with indexes 1<br>
and 2 are sequentially multiplied by signals of control information LBs of<br>
ACKCH#1 and ACKCH#2, respectively. Specifically, at LB 520, each symbol of<br>
a ZC sequence applied in common to ACKCH#1 and ACKCH#2 is multiplied by<br>
an ACK/NACK symbol bi of ACKCH#1 and the first symbol SM of a Fourier<br>
sequence #1. Similarly, at LB 521, each symbol of the ZC sequence is multiplied<br>
by an ACK/NACK symbol b2 of ACKCH#2 and the first symbol S1,1 of a Fourier<br>
sequence #2.<br>
Meanwhile, since two RS LBs 511~514 exist in one slot, length-2 Walsh<br>
sequences with different indexes are applied to ACKCH#1 500 and ACKCH#2<br>
501 at RS LBs 511-514. When ZC sequences with the same cyclic shift value<br>
510 are applied to ACKCH#1 500 and ACKCH#2 501 as described above, since a<br>
length of the orthogonal sequence Sm,n is 5, three more orthogonal sequences are<br>
available. However, as stated above, since only two LBs capable of transmitting<br>
the RS existing in one slot, there is a problem in that it is not possible to generate<br>
additional RS signals other than ACKCH#1 500 and ACKCH#2 501 when<br>
applying the same ZC sequences to the control information LBs.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described in<br>
detail with reference to the annexed drawings. In the following description,<br>
descriptions of known functions and configurations incorporated herein have been<br>
omitted for clarity and conciseness. Terms used herein are defined based on<br>
functions in the present invention and may vary according to users, operators'<br>
intention, or usual practices. Therefore, the definition of the terms should be<br>
made based on contents throughout the specification.<br>
Although a description of the present invention will be made herein with<br>
reference to an OFDM-based wireless communication system, especially to the<br>
3GPP EUTPvA standard, the present invention can be applied to other<br>
communication systems having a similar technical background and channel<br>
format with a slight modification without departing from the scope of the present<br>
invention.<br>
An aspect of the present invention is to multiplex a Channel Sounding<br>
Reference Signal (CS RS) channel and an uplink control channel in a wireless<br>
communication system. A CS RS, which is a pilot signal that a base station<br>
receives from each terminal, is used by the base station in estimating a channel<br>
state from each terminal till the base station. Based on the estimation result, the<br>
base station determines a data channel of which terminal it will schedule, for<br>
every sub frame. For a CS RS channel, each terminal can have a different<br>
transmission bandwidth and a different transmission period according to the<br>
terminal state.<br>
The present invention provides a technology for transmitting a CS RS at<br>
the time completely separated from the transmission time of other uplink channels,<br>
including data and control channels, and matching a bandwidth of allocated<br>
resources to the entire uplink system bandwidth (300 in FIG. 3), thereby<br>
preventing influence on the number of control channels transmittable in control<br>
channel resources 308, 309, 310 and 311 in the uplink. In addition, the present<br>
invention differently applies a length of an orthogonal sequence applied to a<br>
control channel, i.e., an ACK/NACK channel, in a slot where the CS RS is<br>
transmitted and a slot where the CS RS is not transmitted, thereby enabling<br>
transmission of the same number of ACK/NACK channels in the two slots<br>
regardless of whether the control channel and CS RS exist in the same slot.<br>
A detailed description will now be made of a CS RS transmission<br>
technology provided by the present invention through the following preferred<br>
embodiment.<br>
A Preferredembodiment of the present invention does not overlap a CS<br>
RS in RUs for transmitting an uplink control channel, and according thereto, uses<br>
one of LBs which the control channel do not use, for the CS RS transmission. In<br>
this case, an orthogonal sequence is applied to an ACK/NACK channel according<br>
to the number of LBs for ACK/NACK bit transmission, remaining after being<br>
applied to the CS RS.<br>
FIG. 6 illustrates typical multiplexing of a channel sounding channel and<br>
other channels.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, an uplink system band 601 is composed of N first<br>
RUs 602 and M second RUs 603, all of which are used as control channel(s), and<br>
a central band between the first and second RUs 602 and 603. ACK/NACK<br>
symbols are transmitted using four LBs, and RS is transmitted using three LBs in<br>
control channel slots 608, 609, 610 and 611.<br>
As illustrated, a CS RS channel 600 can be multiplexed with other uplink<br>
channels. The CS RS channel 600 is disposed in the first LB interval of the<br>
central band to which a data channel 605 is mapped. CS RSs transmitted by<br>
several terminals undergo CDM using cyclic shifting of ZC sequences, or are<br>
multiplexed to different frequency resources.<br>
Generally, the number of uplink RUs 602 and 603 used for control<br>
channel transmission can vary for every subframe according to the number of<br>
necessary control channels. In that case, in the CS RS multiplexing structure<br>
shown in FIG. 6, a transmission bandwidth of the CS RS channel 600 should<br>
change for every subframe according to the number of control channel RUs 602<br>
and 603 in use so that a band of the CS RS channel 600 should not overlap with<br>
the band occupied by the control channels, which prevents interference from<br>
occurring between the CS RS channel 600 and the control channels.<br>
For this reason, in order for the transmission bandwidth of the CS RS<br>
channel 600 to change, it is necessary that terminals transmitting CS RSs must<br>
continuously receive, from the base station, signaling information on a band of<br>
the CS RS channel to be applied in the corresponding subframe. In addition, it is<br>
necessary that CS RS channels of various bandwidths should be defined. In this<br>
case, multiplexing a CS RS from each terminal is complicated, causing a load of<br>
determining CS RS sequences of various lengths. Accordingly, there is a need to<br>
solve this problem.<br>
FIG. 7 illustrates multiplexing of a CS RS channel and other channels<br>
according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 7, an uplink system band 701 is composed of N first<br>
RUs 706 and M second RUs 707, all of which are used as control channel(s), and<br>
a central band 705 between the first and second RUs 706 and 707. A data channel<br>
is mapped to the central band 705. ACK/NACK symbols for an ACK/NACK<br>
channel or CQI symbols for a CQI channel are transmitted in control channel<br>
slots 708 and 709 (710 and 711)<br>
of the control channel RUs 706 and 707, respectively.<br>
Here, in one sub frame 703 composed of two slots 720 and 721, a CS RS<br>
channel 700 is allocated resources over the entire system band 701 of the uplink<br>
during the first LB 713 regardless of the number of RUs 706 and 707 used for<br>
transmission of uplink control channels. Therefore, the transmission bandwidth of<br>
the CS RS channel 700 can be maintained constant in the subframe 703 regardless<br>
of the number of RUs 706 and 707 used for transmission of control channels.<br>
Accordingly, the system indicates the band and transmission period to be used as<br>
a CS RS channel for each terminal, and each terminal periodically transmits CS<br>
RS using the indicated resources without the need to receive additional signaling<br>
from the base station.<br>
Therefore, the present invention can satisfy the single-carrier<br>
transmission characteristic required for SC-FDMA transmission even when a<br>
terminal should simultaneously transmit CS RS and a control channel in an<br>
arbitrary subframe. In addition, the present invention differently applies a length<br>
of an orthogonal sequence applied to an ACK/NACK channel in a slot where CS<br>
RS is transmitted and a slot where CS RS is not transmitted, thereby enabling<br>
transmission of the same number of ACK/NACK channels in the two slots<br>
regardless of multiplexing of CS RS.<br>
Among the LBs constituting the first slot 720, one LB is not used for a<br>
control channel as shown by reference numeral 712, and since uplink control<br>
channels are transmitted while undergoing frequency hopping for a 1-ms<br>
subframe as described above, it is necessary that the same number of control<br>
channels can be transmitted in the control channel slots 709 and 710. Similarly,<br>
even in the control channel slots 708 and 711, the same number of control<br>
channels should be transmitted. An uplink ACK/NACK channel structure for<br>
satisfying such requirements will be described below.<br>
FIG. 8 illustrates an example where ACK/NACK channels using a ZC<br>
sequence, to which one same cyclic shift value is applied, are multiplexed in one<br>
LB according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8, S3i,j denotes a jth sample of a length-3 orthogonal<br>
sequence having an ith index, and S4i,j denotes a jth sample of a length-4<br>
orthogonal sequence having an 1th index. The orthogonal sequences S3i,j and S4i,j<br>
are used for transmission of ACKCH#i in the first slot 720 and the second slot<br>
721, respectively._<br>
For the first slot 720, since CS RS is transmitted at the first LB interval<br>
806 as described in FIG. 7, a length-3 orthogonal sequence S3jj is used in the first<br>
slot in order to maintain orthogonality between ACKCH#1~3. For this purpose, a<br>
length-3 Fourier sequence can be applied as the orthogonal sequence.<br>
Meanwhile, a length-3 sequence Wi,j is used as a CS RS for channel<br>
estimation of ACKCH#i. Since the LB where the sequence Wi,j is transmitted is<br>
not punctured by the CS RS, positions of the LB are equal in the first slot 720 and<br>
the second slot 721. When the CS RS is transmitted at an arbitrary LB in a<br>
subframe as stated above, since the LB where the CS RS is transmitted cannot be<br>
used for control channel transmission, the number of LBs for ACK/NACK<br>
symbols and LBs for RS transmission, except the LB for transmission of the CS<br>
RS, which is set to be equal in both slots.<br>
By proposing the ACK/NACK channel structure shown in FIG. 8, the<br>
number of ACK/NACK channels that can undergo coherent transmission can be<br>
maintained at three channels regardless of the transmission of the CS RS in the<br>
corresponding subframe.<br>
Although an index of a sequence for ACKCH#i used in the first slot 720 -<br>
and the second slot 721 does not change in this embodiment, when sequence<br>
hopping is applied between slots for inter-cell interference diversity, an index of a<br>
sequence used between the two slots can change for one ACK/NACK channel,<br>
and the index change is not limited in the present invention.<br>
Although a description of an embodiment of the present invention has<br>
been made herein for a case where a CS RS is transmitted at the first LB of the<br>
first slot in a subframe, the present invention is not limited to the position of the<br>
CS RS channel. However, by providing that the LB of an ACK/NACK symbol is<br>
punctured in the slot where the CS RS is transmitted and the number of LBs<br>
where the CS RS is transmitted is equal between two slots, the number of<br>
transmittable ACK/NACK channels can be equal in the slot where the CS RS is<br>
transmitted and the slot where the CS RS is not transmitted. An example of this<br>
case will be described with reference to FIG. 9.<br>
FIG. 9 is a flowchart illustrating a transmission operation of a terminal<br>
according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 9, in step 900, a terminal generates an ACK/NACK<br>
symbol according to a success or failure in decoding of data received over a data<br>
channel in the downlink. In step 901, the terminal determines whether there are<br>
any LBs where a CS RS can be transmitted, in a subframe for transmitting the<br>
ACK/NACK symbol. The determination can be achieved from system<br>
configuration information or upper layer signaling information for uplink<br>
channels.<br>
If it is determined in step 901 that there is no LB where the CS RS can be<br>
transmitted in the subframe for transmitting the ACK/NACK symbol, the terminal<br>
maps in step 902 the ACK/NACK symbol or RS symbols to all LBs in the<br>
subframe according to a predefined pattern. In step 903, the terminal applies an<br>
orthogonal sequence with a length predefined for each slot to the mapped<br>
ACK/NACK symbol or RS symbols, and then proceeds to step 906. For example,<br>
when four ACK/NACK symbol LBs and three RS symbol LBs exist in one slot as<br>
in the second slot 721 of FIG. 8, a length-4 orthogonal sequence S4i,j can be<br>
applied to the four ACK/NACK symbol LBs and a length-3 orthogonal sequence<br>
Wjj can be applied to the three RS symbol LBs as shown in FIG. 7. In this case,<br>
for a high-speed terminal, a length-2 orthogonal sequence can be applied twice to<br>
the four ACK/NACK symbol LBs.<br>
However, if it is determined that there is an LB where the CS RS can be<br>
transmitted in the subframe for transmitting the ACK/NACK symbol, the terminal<br>
punctures, in step 904, the ACK/NACK symbol allocated to the LB where the CS<br>
RS exists, does not map the ACK/NACK symbol allocated to the LB where the<br>
CS RS exists, and maps the ACK/NACK symbol or RS symbol to the remaining<br>
LBs in the subframe according to a predefined pattern. This process is as shown<br>
in the first slot 720 in FIG. 7. In step 905, the terminal applies, to the slot, an<br>
orthogonal sequence having a length reduced by the number of punctured<br>
symbols for the ACK/NACK symbol punctured as in the first slot 720, and<br>
applies an orthogonal sequence with a normal or a predefined length (sequence<br>
for ACK/NACK) to the ACK/NACK symbol or RS symbol of the unpunctured<br>
slot, and then proceeds to step 906, i.e., the orthogonal sequence applied in step<br>
905 is determined according to the number of LBs remaining after being applied<br>
to the CS RS.<br>
In step 906, the terminal applies a ZC sequence to the ACK/NACK<br>
symbol or RS symbol, as shown in FIG. 4, and then transmits the ACK/NACK<br>
symbol or RS symbol.<br>
FIG. 10 illustrates multiplexing of a CS RS channel and other channels<br>
according to another preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 10, an uplink system band 1010 is composed of N first<br>
RUs 1001 and M second RUs 1002, all of which are used as control channel(s),<br>
and a central band 1011 between the first and second RUs 1001 and 1002. A data<br>
channel 1012 is mapped to the central band 1011. ACK/NACK symbols for an<br>
ACK/NACK symbols or CQI symbols for a CQI channel are transmitted in the<br>
control channel RUs 1001 and 1002.<br>
A difference between the multiplexing structure shown in FIG. 10 and the<br>
multiplexing structure shown in FIG. 7 is in that a CS RS transmission band 1000<br>
does not overlap with transmission bands 1001 and 1002 for an uplink control<br>
channel such as ACK/NACK channel and CQI channel. However, as in FIG. 7, in<br>
an LB 1005 where a CS RS is transmitted, the ACK/NACK symbol and the CQI<br>
symbol are not transmitted in the bands indicated by reference numerals 1003 and<br>
1004. By transmitting the CS RS only in the band of a data channel in this way, it<br>
is possible to prevent the power loss which may occur as the CS RS is transmitted<br>
even in the band of the uplink control channel, i.e., it is possible to improve<br>
estimation accuracy of channel state information for scheduling the uplink data<br>
channel.<br>
As is apparent from the foregoing description, the present invention can<br>
satisfy the single-carrier transmission characteristic required for SC-FDMA<br>
transmission even when one terminal must simultaneously transmit a CS RS<br>
channel and a control channel in one subframe. That is, the present invention<br>
allows the CS RS channel and the control channel to be independently transmitted<br>
in the SC-FDMA system, so that each terminal can always transmit each channel<br>
whenever needed while satisfying the single-carrier transmission characteristic.<br>
The base station receives the CS RS channel and control channels from each<br>
terminal at a predetermined time, thereby scheduling a data channel to each<br>
terminal both in the uplink and downlink at the right time, i.e., at the<br>
corresponding timing, and thus contributing to an improvement of the system<br>
performance.<br>
While the invention has been shown and described with reference to a<br>
certain preferred embodiment thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the<br>
art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended<br>
