The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br>
GRANTED<br><br><br><br><br>
THE METHOD OF WIND-COLLECTING POWER GENERATION AND ITS<br>
EQUIPMENT<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the method and equipment of wind power generation, especially in the wind power accumulating power generation method and equipment.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Many conventional power generating ways, such as fuel power generation by coals, oils and gases, nuclear power generation, etc. pullets environment greatly. Moreover, nuclear power generation has safety consideration and thus cannot be accepted by people. Waterpower generation has limited natural resource. Most of usable waterpower resources are developed. To have more power to provide for human, many new power generation ways, such as by wind, solar energy, sea water, etc. are developed.<br>
In 1920 ages, wind wheels are used in power generation. In 1931, a wind power generator of 100KW is built in the Crimean Balaclava, Soviet Union, this is an earliest wind power generator. According to the data of German, at the end of 2000, there are 9375 wind power generators are installed, which generates 6113 MW, occupying 2.5% of power production in German in that year. Moreover, in that year, the wind power generators in German are grown from 1496 to 1668.<br>
Most of the conventional wind power generator is installed vertically and the axial center of the rotary shaft faces the direction of horizontal airflow. Most of the wind power generators use natural airflow to actuate fan. Then gears in gearbox change the speed so that the power generator on the wheel axis generates power. The conventional blade-type horizontal axial wind power generation has the following defects.<br>
1.	The cross section of airflow for the blade-type wind power turbine to receiving wind power is finite, so that the power generated is finite.<br>
2.	The maximum efficiency of a conventional wind power turbine   is only 59.26%.<br>
3.	The friction loss of gearbox is large.<br>
4.	the larger conventional blade-type wind power turbine structure is easily damaged by hurricane.<br><br>
5.	If wind power is smaller, the power generation is confined.<br>
6.	A larger cross section of airflow is necessary.<br>
7.	When wind is weak, the fans cannot be actuated.<br>
8.	The air resistances of the blades are proportional to the two orders of the rotation speed and thus the output power is confined.<br>
9.	The fan cannot rotate steadily due to the boundary layer effect of the ground.<br><br>
10.	Since a large cross section of airflow is necessary and thus a large amount of money is necessary for building structure foundation<br>
11.	Large noise generates when fans rotate.<br>
Due to above defects, the conventional wind power generator has a low economic efficiency, and the wind power generation cannot be widely accepted by people.<br>
Conventionally, wind power generators use natural airflow to drive fan to generate power. To increase power generator efficiency, the cross section of airflow of the wind wheel and fan is increased. Thereby, the radius of the fan is larger and larger and the supported structure is also larger and larger. Thus the cost in the foundation is increased, but the power generation is limited. By the boundary layer effect of airflow, the horizontal speed of wind is varied with elevation and the wind speed is changed irregularly. When the larger scale fan rotates, an unbalance force will acting to the fan, so that the structure of ihe fan is damaged. When the conventional fan rotates with a high speed, the gearbox is easy to generate high temperature and the blades are easy to be damaged. Thus, the fans must be cut-off.<br>
By the experiences from the global practices, in the conventional wind power generator with horizontal axial blades, the wind power generators with two blades have a higher mechanical efficiency with output coefficients greater than 0.40 to 0.47. This high speed wind wheel has a high specific speed. The air resistance as the blade rotates in high speed is positively proportionally to the square of the rotation speed of tangent direction. If the natural wind speed is 12 - 17 meters per second, the rotation speed of the blade will be near one half of sound speed. Thereby, air resistance is large and output power will achieve a maximum value, which is called as a device capacity. When the natural wind speed is over 12 to 17 meters per second, the power generation is not increased with the wind speed, but the output power is reduced or remained no changed.   If the natural wind speed is 25 - 30 meters per second, the<br><br>
rotation speed of the blade will be near sound speed. Since the area of blade and air resistance of the blade is large, a too larger air resistance will induce the turbine to cutoff.<br>
Besides, according to the fluid dynamics, the limit efficiency of the conventional horizontal axial wind power generator is 59.26%, but because the power loss as wind power is converted into electric power, the practical efficiency is at most 47%.<br>
From above description, the power efficiency of wind power generator is positively proportional to the three orders of the speed of air applied to the wind wheel or fan. Thereby, the effective way to improve power generation is to increase the air speed applied to the wind wheel or fan. Since the power generation of the wind power generator is positively proportionally to the rotary torque of the wind wheel and the torque is positively proportional to the force and arm of force, to increase the power generation it is necessary to increase the force applied and arm of force.<br>
Conventionally the resistance of the conventional blades is increased with the square of the rotation speed. After the wind speed is over a satisfactory wind speed, the fan wilf generate a great air resistance. Because the air resistance is larger than the rotation force, the output power will reduce instead of increasing. If it is desired to increase the airflow speed applied to the wind wheel or fan for increasing the power generation, a wind wheel system and induction power generator completely different from the conventional structures must be produced. Moreover, a method and device for controlling the wind wheel and driving the airflow are necessary. Besides, since when air rubs blades, vibration occurs so that noise is generated. When the air resistance is increased greatly, noise will also increase. Thereby, a novel low air resistance wind wheel device must be developed for replacing the conventional blades and overcoming the problem of noises. To reduce the wind speed necessary for actuating the wind wheel so as to increase the power generation, a novel wind power accumulator and power generating tower are necessary for accumulating the mass, power and momentum of the airflow so as to increase the speed and force of the airflow applied to the wind wheel. Thereby, even the strength of air is weak, the wind wheel device can be operated. A wind power accumulating device is used for increasing the airflow on the wind wheel or a power generating tower is necessary for guiding the airflow. To avoid the edge effect, the wind power generating tower is necessary. Furthermore, to avoid the limitation of 59.26% of power efficiency, a novel<br><br>
wind wheel system is necessary. To cause the output power to be positively proportional to the three orders of the wind speed in hurricane, a low air resistance wind wheel system is necessary for reducing the air resistance when wind wheel rotates in high speed. To reduce the air resistance when the wind turbine rotates reversely to the wind speed, a flow guide device is used to shield natural airflow. A tail is used to change the direction of the wind by the wind power accumulating device, power generating tower and the flow guide device. The tail can be used to rotate a supporting system. The wind power accumulating power generating method and device of the present invention is invented by fluid dynamic principle.<br>
Accordingly, the aim of the present invention is to provide a wind power accumulating power generating method and device for accumulating large wind power so as to adjust the direction of wind and the cross section for receiving wind so as to control the power generation.<br>
Another aim of the present invention is to provide a wind power accumulating power generating method and device with a larger wind accumulating area.<br>
Another aim of the present invention is to provide a wind power accumulating  power generating method and device with a lower mechanic friction loss.<br>
Another aim of the present invention is to provide a wind power accumulating power generating method and device which can avoid the damage from wind hurricane.<br>
Another aim of the present invention is to provide a wind power accumulating power generating method and device which can generate strong airflow even the natural airflow is weak so as to retain the rotation of the wind turbine.<br>
Another aim of the present invention is to provide a wind power accumulating power generating method and device with a lower air resistance and large power generation ability and high efficiency.<br>
Another aim of the present invention is to provide a wind power accumufafing power generating method and device, wherein the boundary layer effect of the ground is considered into the design of the method and device.<br><br>
Another aim of the present invention is to provide a wind power accumulating power generating method and device which provide a vertical shaft and a tail for adjusting the wind accumulating direction.<br>
Another aim of the present invention is to provide a wind power accumulating power generating method and device with a power efficiency larger than 59.26%.<br>
It is known from fluid dynamic that the power efficiency of a wind power generator is positively proportional to the density of the wind power, and the wind receiving areas of the wind wheels or fans and is positively proportional to the three orders of the airflow speed. The power of the wind power generator is positively proportional to the torque of the wind wheel or fan. Therefore, there are several ways for increasing power efficiency of the wind wheel or fan.<br>
      1. To increase the density of air, but this is very difficult.<br>
2.	To increase the airflow cross section of the wind wheel or fan, this is used in the conventional wind power generators.<br>
3.	A negative pressure is applied to the backside of the wind wheel or fan, this is used to current wind power generators. This is used in the present invention and is also an effective method.<br>
4.	The air speed on the wind wheel or fan is increased so as to increase the force applied to the wind wheel device is increased. This is used in the present invention and is also an effective method.<br>
5.	The natural airflow is guided to enlarge the rotational arm of force applied to the wind wheel device. This way is used in the present invention so as to increase the rotational torque.<br>
6.	A flow guide device is used to shield the airflow and to reduce the air resistance as the wind wheel rotates along a reverse direction of the wind flow. This is used in the present invention.<br>
        7. Low air resistance wind turbine device and wind power reflector device are used to reduce the air resistance as the wind turbine rotates. This is used in the present invention.<br>
8. The mechanical resistance from,other factors is reduced, for example, not to use a gearbox. This is used in the present invention.<br><br>
9. The wind turbine device is designed based on impulse turbine theory so that the mechanical efficiency is not confined by 59.26 %. This is used in the present invention.<br>
The present invention relates to a method and device for generating power by wind, wherein a wind turbine device pivotally installed to a supporting shaft of a power generating tower. The supporting shaft is a hollow or solid shaft. The supporting shaft is perpendicularly to the ground. If the supporting shaft is hollow, the hollow portion can be passed by power wires. The wind turbine device is formed by a plurality of spoon-like devices which are annularly arranged, or the wind turbine device has a plurality of wind power reflector which are annularly arranged on a supporting device. The spoons or the wind power reflector supporting devices or a shaft of the wind power turbine device are installed with power generators. When the wind turbines rotate, power is generated.<br>
The present invention is realized by the following ways.<br>
1.	A wind turbine device or a power generating tower structure are used to collect wind power so that the density and speed of the wind increase dramatically. Then, by the guiding of the wind-collecting device and power generating towers, the airflow is concentrated at the wind power reflector at the edge of the wind power turbine device. Not only the wind force applied to the wind power reflector device is increased. Moreover, the rotation force applied to the wind power turbine device is enlarged. Thereby, a larger rotation torque is acquired. Moreover, the wind turbine device pivotally installed to the power generating tower can rotate rapidly. Then strong induced current is generated by power generators so that the power generation is increased dramatically.<br>
2.	The wind turbine device is design by impulse turbine theory. A* tail of the wind power reflector of the wind turbine device is installed with concave smooth groove and hole so that air flows impacting into the concave hole or groove will reflecting back so as to have a larger momentum. Thus the wind turbine device has a great reaction. Thereby, a great rotation torque is acquired. Then by a power generator, a larger power is generated. Thus the mechanical efficiency of the present invention can be over 59.26   .<br><br><br>
3.	The wind turbine device of the present invention has a lpwer air resistance. The air resistance as the wind turbine retetes is reduced. The wind power reflector has a shape selected from one of a bullet type with a tail end Which has a semispherical concave hole, a concave plate, a curved vane, a concave semi-cone shape, a concave pyramid-shape shell, a concave cone-shape shell, a dome-shape shell, a semi-cylindrical shape, a curved shell shape, a angle-shape plate, and a spiral-shape. In operation, the air resistance of the wind turbine is smaller. Thereby, as the wind is very great, the output electric power is positively proportional to the three orders of the natural wind speed.	<br>
4.	A flow guide device is installed in the front side of the power generating tower for shielding airflow so as to reduce the air resistance with the wind turbine rotates reverse to the direction of the wind.<br>
5.	The axis of the wind turbine device is collinear with the axis of the power generating tower and is vertical to the ground. Each power generating tower is pivotally installed with a plurality of horizontal wind turbine devices. Each wind turbine device can rotate independently by the driving of airflow so as to meet the boundary layer effect of the ground.<br>
6.	A tail and a rotationable supporting system are used.   A power generator is<br>
'V.<br>
installed on the supporting system. The supporting system can automatically adjust the wind power accumulating direction.<br>
7.	A plurality of power generators of lower rotational speed and larger magnetic flux variation are used to replaced one high rotational speed and small magnetic flux variation power generator. The power generator rotates with the wind turbine device and is cooled by air so as to output large power. Each wind turbine device has different rotation speed so that irregular vibration or instability will not occur.<br>
8.	A lower resistance high speed bearing is used to pivotally install the wind turbine device to the power generating tower. The magnetic pole set or the loop induction unit of the power generating tower is directly installed to the wind turbine device. When the wind turbine device rotates, power is generated by magnetic induction. Not only no problem of mechanic friction loss of the gear box, but also the high temperature problem of the gear box in high speed operation is avoided.<br><br>
9. The low air resistance wind turbine device causes that even in high speed rotation, the wind turbine device of the present invention has no noise so that the noise from blades device is avoided.<br>

the diameter of each wind turbine. One power generating tower is fixed and another<br>
one js fixed to a movable base. A funnel shape air flow channel is formed between the<br>
two power generating towers so that the two power generating towers have a function<br>
of accumulating wind power as a virtual wind-collecting device. The wind turbine devices on the two power generating towers are arranged symmetrically at two sides of the two power generating towers.

When wind applies to the tail, the wind power accumulating direction of the power generating towers is changed automatically.<br>
(13)	The present invention can be realized by several groups, each group containing a set of wind power generation system according to the present invention.<br>
In above embodiment, the way for building a wind-collecting device is that: to building a device having a wind outlet and a wind inlet The cross section of the wind inlet is larger than that of the wind outlet for accumulating the mass, momentum, power of the airflow. The wind-collecting device has a fix or a movable base for changing the wind accumulating direction; cross sections of the wind inlet, wind outlet and shape of the wind-collecting device can be controlled. The cross section of the wind outlet and wind inlet can be closed or opened. By moving, rotating or displacing the wind power accumulating device or to control the shape of the wind-collecting device, the wind power accumulating direction and cross section are changeable so as to control the speed of the driving airflow in the wind outlet. By changing the cross section of the wind outlet, the speed of the airflow in the wind outlet is changed. Above mentioned methods can be performed singly or combined for achieving the aim of adjusting power generation.<br><br>
Besides, in the present invention, a supporting device between power generating towers is constructed. The length of the supporting device is fixed or telescopic for changing the distance between the two power generating towers and adjusting the airflow speed between the two power generating towers so as to adjust the power generation. Since the airflow between the power generating towers is quicker, a larger lateral pressure is generated due to the structures of the wind turbine device and the power generating towers, the supporting device between the two power generating towers will resist this lateral pressure, we call Magnus effect.<br>
The power generating tower according to the present invention  has a supporting shaft vertical to the ground, A plurality of wind turbine devices is installed on the power generating tower. The axis of the each wind turbine device is collinear to<br>
the axis of the power generating tower.   When one of the wind turbine.ndevice is necessary to the maintained, the brake of the wind turbine can be actuated for<br><br>
stopping the motion of the wind turbine. When a huge wind blow all the.wind turbine devices of one power generating tower can be braked and the power generating tower is moved to the backside of another fixed type power generating tower so as to avoid the wind turbine to rotate too quick so as to overpower to damage the whole power generation system.<br>
Above wind turbine device is completely different from the convention fan structure. The wind turbine device of the present invention uses impulse turbine theory to match the structure of the power generating towers so as to generate a novel wind turbine system. The wind turbine includes a plurality of wind power reflectors, a plurality of wind power reflector supporting beams, an annular bearing, a first annular beam, a second annular beam, a plurality of supporting wheels, an annular track, a plurality of brakes, and a dust-proof device. The annular bearing is installed on the tower body of the power generating tower so that the axis of the annular bearing is collinear to the axis of the tower body. The wind power reflector is installed to the free end of the supporting beam so that the wind power reflector and the supporting beam is formed as a wind spoon. A plurality of wind spoons are arranged annularly to be pivotally installed to the annular bearing. Two annular beams are installed below each wind spoon. The spoon is fixed to the two annular beams. A plurality of supporting wheels is installed below the first annular beam. The annular track is installed to the power generating tower for supporting the wind turbine device. Another annular beam has no supporting wheel, but a plurality of brakes is installed below this annular beam.<br><br>
If necessary, the brake can be actuated to stop the wind turbine and lock the wind turbine. The axes of the two annular beams, annular tracks, annular bearing, power generating towers are collinear. A tail of the wind-collecting device has a concave smooth hole or groove for reflecting from the impulse of airflow. A head of the wind power accumulator has a tip or tapered wind pierce device for reducing the air resistance in rotating the wind turbine device. The wind turbine used this way has a small specific speed. The similar principle has widely used in water power generation and steam power generation with a mechanic efficiency over 80%, about two or three times of the conventional blade-type wind turbine. A diameter of the wind turbine device is D, a size of the wind power reflector in the radius direction is d, a speed ratio of the wind turbine is Ns, then D/d=(30~90) / Ns, Ns is between 2-6, Ns is a ratio of the wind speed to the tangent speed of the wind turbine. Preferably, Ns is between 2 to 3. This wind turbine device is suitable to be installed to a huge wind power generator. Each element can be easy manufactured individually and then is assembled to the power generating tower.<br>
The wind power reflector has a shape selected from one of a bullet type with a tail end which has a semispherical concave hole, a concave plate, a curved vane, a concave semi-cone shape, a concave pyramid-shape shell, a coricave cone-shape shell, a dome-shape shell, a semi-cylindrical shape, a curved shell shape, a angle-shape plate, and a spiral-shape; a concave surface of the wind power reflector faces the airflow; and a back side of the wind power accumulator has a needle or a taper tip. Preferably, the wind turbine device 50 is made of titanium alloy, or stainless steel, or carbon fiber, or glass steel, or other high strength corrosion-preventing alloy. Preferably, the wind power reflector 52 has a tail with two symmetrical and smooth cups therein so as to increase the stability. To have a maximum mechanic efficiency, when air flow flushes the two cups at the tail end. In the present invention, the airflow reflect angle is the reflecting angle when air is reflected from the surface of a groove. The wind reflect angle of the airflow is between 120 to 180, preferably, between 173 degrees to 176 degrees. A tail of the wind power reflector of the wind turbine device is installed with concave smooth groove and hole so that air flows impact into the hole or groove will reflect so as to have a larger momentum. Thus the wind turbine device has a great reaction. Thereby, a great rotation torque is acquired. Then a power generator generates a larger power. The backside of a concave hole or groove of the wind power reflector has a tip or tapered wind pierce device. With respect to the tail, the wind pierce device is the head of the wind power reflector.   The head of the wind<br><br>
power reflector faces to the rotational direction of the wind power reflector. When the wind turbine rotates, air resistance can be reduced. If bullet type wind power reflector is used and the speed of the wind power reflector is smaller than one half of sound speed, the air resistance of the wind power reflector is reduced to be below the 0.25. If bullet type wind power reflector is used and the speed of the wind turbine is over sound speed, the air resistance of the wind power reflector is reduced to be below the 0.5. If bullet type wind power reflector is used and the speed of the wind turbine is over three times of the sound speed, the air resistance of the wind power reflector is reduced to be below the 0.3. A tail of the bullet type wind power reflector has a semi-spherical concave smooth hole. When airflow impact into the hole, the airflow will reflect. From a large amount experimental data, a semi-spherical concave smooth hole shape structure has an airflow reflecting coefficient of 1.4. Since the action of airflow to the tail of the wind power reflector is always larger than that to the head thereof, when the speed of the wind power reflector is equal to sound speed, the wind turbine will still rotates. The power generator of the present invention still generates large power. The air resistance at the head of the wind power reflector is preferred smaller than 0.4 times of the tail thereof.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the wind turbine device of the present invention, there are at least two wind power reflectors are annularly arranged, which are installed on the supporting device of the wind power reflector. When in high rotation, the wind turbine device has a preferred stability. The wind power reflector has a shape selected from disk-like shape, round shape, wheel shape, and cylindrical shape. An outer edge thereof has horizontaTor vertical annular pieces. Each annular piece is installed with at least two wind power reflectors which are arranged annularly so as to be formed with a wind turbine device. If the annular piece is horizontal, the upper and lower surfaces of the annular piece are installed with respective wind power reflector so that the wind turbine device can be rotated stably. Moreover, dust-proof device can be installed to the vertical annular piece for preventing dust of air from accumulating to the power generator. Two sets of wind power reflectors are annularly arranged and are installed to the annular pieces so as to be formed as a wind turbine device. By the vertical annular pieces, when the wind turbine device rotates, the boundary layer of the wind turbine will move with airflow so as to reduce the resistance on the boundary layer greatly and increase the power generation. This kind wind turbine is suitable to be installed to a middle or small type power generating tower. It is preferably that the wind power reflector supporting device is formed integrally in the<br><br>
plant. Then the wind power turbine is installed to the power generating tower. The wind power reflector has a shape selected from one of a bullet type with a tail end which has a semispherical concave hole, a concave plate, a curved fan, a concave semi-cone shape, a concave pyramid-shape shell, a concave cone-shape shell, a dome-shape shell, a semi-cylindrical shape, a curved shell shape, a angle-shape plate, and a spiral-shape, so as to have a lower air resistance. A tail of the wind power reflector has a smooth concave hole or groove so that air can be reflected, and thus the wind turbine device can get a great impulse. An outer surface of the wind power reflector is smooth and has a low air resistance so that when the wind turbine rotates in a high speed, the air resistance is limited.<br>

Furthermore, as shown in Figs. 2A and 2B, when strong wind occurs, the wind turbine devices 50 of one tower can be braked and are move to a side of another tower not blowing by wind so as to avoid the wind turbine devices 50 to operate too quickly so as to generate a too larger power to damage the power generating device. If the wind-collecting device 10 is installed, the wind-collecting device 10 can be closed to be formed as a wind mask for protecting the power generating tower 20 so as to prevent from overpower so to damage the whole power generator.<br>
The power generator 70 of the present invention has a magnetic pole set 71 and a coil induction unit 72 which are installed to a supporting beam 55 and an annular plate 24 of a suspending arm of a supporter of the tower. When the wind turbine 50 rotates with a higher speed, the coil induction unit 72 of a larger flux cross section will cut the magnetic field so that the total magnet flux will change greatly to generate a great induction current.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, as shown in Fig. 13, at least, a tail device 14 and a supporting system 15 are built. Furthermore, a wind-collecting device 10 and two power generating towers 20 are structured on the supporting system 15. Two movable bases 23 are constructed on the supporting system 15. The two power generating towers 20 are installed on the two movable bases 23. The two power generating towers 20 are movable to one another. The net distance between the two power generating towers 20 are not over two times of the diameter of the wind turbine 50. Wind receiving faces of the two power generating towers 20 are installed with a funnel-like air flow channel so that wind can be collected by the power generating towers 20 as a virtual wind-collecting device 10. Two sides of the airflow channel are arranged with the wind turbine devices 50 which are arranged symmetrically at the left and right sides. When the wind turbine devices 50 are actuated, the wind turbines 50 rotate clockwise or counterclockwise. Then the power generator 70 is driven to generate electric flow. A supporter 42 can be installed between the two power generating towers 20 for resisting the tower pressure due to the Magnus effect. The length of the supporter 42 of the power generators is adjustable so as to adjust the airflow speed of the power generators 70. The supporter 42 is installed with wind speed meter and wind pressure meter.   When wind<br><br><br>
blows upon the tail device 14, the supporting system 15 rotates so that the power generating towers 20 and the wind-collecting device 10 have a preferred ability to accumulating wind power.<br>
In another preferred embodiment about the wind turbines of the present invention, referring to Figs. 14A and 14B, the wind turbine 50 is formed by a plurality of tapered wind power reflectors 52 which are arranged on a supporting device 57. The wind power reflectors 52 are symmetrically arranged on the supporting device 57 at the upper and lower sides. An inner side of the wind power reflector 52 has a vertical ring 56. An outer side of the vertical ring 56 is installed with the wind power reflector 52. The magnetic pole sets or coil induction unit 72 is installed on the power generator 70. In the drawing, it is illustrated that in the power generator 70, the coil induction unit 72 is installed on the supporting device 57.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the present invention about two power generating towers being used. When no wind-collecting device 10 is installed, the theoretic power generation is calculated as the following based on the fluid dynamics, wherein the generator has a distance of 1 meter from the ground. The power of the wind wheel is:<br>
(Fu)h   = <br>
Total power output of the two power generators are:<br><br>
where<br>
  = Sum of the value along the height of the towers. D = Diameter of the power generating tower, d = Net distance of the gap between the power generators, p = Density of air. Q = Air flow applied to the wind power reflector.<br>
  = Wind reflect angle of the wind power reflector which fixed on a wind turbine device. A = Airflow receiving cross section of the wind-collecting device.<br>
  = Mechanical efficiency of the wind turbine.<br><br><br>
         n = Ratio of the airflow receiving cross section of the wind power reflector device to the gap cross section between the power generators.   = Ratio of the tangent speed of the wind turbine to the wind speed of the gap, which is the inverse of the ratio NS. h = Height from the ground, a = roughness coefficient of the ground. V10 = Horizontal wind speed, at 10 meter height from the ground. Vh = Horizontal wind speed with a height of h meter from the ground =V10(h/10)a Vs = Wind speed of the gap between the two power generating towers      =Vh(1 +D/d) U = Rotation speed of the wind turbine =ΨVs=ΨVhx(1+D/d) Vr = Relative speed =Vs-U=(1-Ψ)Vs=(1-Ψ)Vh(1+D/d) Q = Air flow applied to the wind power reflector=VsAr|<br>
Thereby, it is known that other than positively proportional to the three orders of the wind speed, diameter of the power generating tower; net distance d of the gap between the power generating towers. Enlarging the ratio of the D / d, the power generating towers serves to accumulate wind power to increase the output power.<br>
In the engineering application of the principle of moving vane to impulse turbine wheel, a series of vanes is mounted on the periphery of a rotating wheel. The vanes are usually so spaced that the entire discharge Qj of the jet is deflected by the vanes. Therefore, the total power output of a frictionless impulse turbine is (Fu)h=pQj(Vs-U)(1-COSe)U<br>
Furthermore, the wind-collecting device has an inlet. The width of the inlet is equal to 2(d+D). Namely, the wind-collecting device accumulates the airflow from the wind receiving faces of the power generating towers so as to increase power generation. When the airflow reflect angle of the wind power reflector is near 180 degrees, the output power will enlarge. The larger the wind resistance of the wind power reflectors, the worse the mechanical efficiency £ of the wind turbine. Therefore, lower air resistance wind power reflectors are used in the present invention. This is beneficial<br><br><br><br>
