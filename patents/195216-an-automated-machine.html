				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to automated banking machines.   Specifically, this invention relates to an automated teller machine enclosure which provides enhanced service access.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Automated teller machines (ATMs) are known in the prior art. Customers of financial institutions may perform banking transactions, make inquiries concerning the status of their accounts, pay bills and obtain other banking services using automated teller machines.   Typically a customer uses a magnetically coded card that is inserted into the machine.   The customer also inputs a personal identification number that allows the automated teller machine to verify the customer's identity.   After the customer has conducted their transactions, the customer's card is returned along with one or more receipts which document the transactions conducted.<br>
In recent years the number of transactions that may be conducted at automated teller machines has increased.   Some automated teller machines now have the ability of reading and verifying checks or other instruments. This can be done by including a device in the automated teller machine such as is shown in U.S. Patent 5,422,467 which is owned by the assignee of the present invention.<br><br>
also arranged in a side-by-side relation so that the amount of floor space required for servicing the components is minimized.<br>
While Applicants prior invention constitutes a significant improvement over the prior art, there still exists a need for providing even greater service access to the components comprising an automated teller machine. This is particularly true as more devices are added to the interior of the machine. Further, as more functions are available to be performed by an automated teller machine, the more customer display and input devices must be provided at the ATM fascia which forms the customer interface. Servicing components on a fascia can be difficult in many ATM configurations due to restricted service access.<br>
Thus, there exists a need for an automated teller machine with improved service access for internal components and components which reside on a fascia which is part of the customer interface.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
The  present  invention  relates  to  an  automated   banking  machine comprising:<br>
an enclosure having an interior area housing a plurality of banking machine components, characterized in that<br>
said enclosure having a front opening and a rear opening, wherein said components are accessible through at least one of said openings;<br><br>
a service door in movable connection with the said enclosure, wherein said service door is operable to selectively close said rear opening;<br>
a fascia (22), wherein said fascia is movably mounted relative to said enclosure, wherein said fascia is movable between a closing position wherein said fascia closes said front opening, and an open position wherein said fascia is disposed from said front opening.<br>
a disengageable latch, wherein said latch is in an engaged condition to hold said fascia in the closing position in said front opening.<br>
spring, wherein said spring biases said fascia outward from said front opening, whereby said spring is operable to move said fascia outward upon disengagement of said latch.<br><br>
The machine includes a service door which is movably mounted on<br>
the enclosure.   The service door is controlled by a lock and is operable to<br>
selectively close the rear opening when the machine is in operation.   The<br>
service door is opened when it is desired to gain access to the components<br>
5	which are accessible through the rear opening.<br>
The machine also includes a fascia which is a part of the customer<br>
interface.   The fascia is removably positioned in the front opening of the<br>
enclosure.   When it is desired to service components which are accessible<br>
through the front opening or to service components that are mounted on the<br>
10	fascia, the fascia may be removed to open the front opening.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the invention the front fascia is<br>
secured in the front opening by a disengageable latch.   When the fascia is<br>
in the front opening the disengageable latch is accessible only from the<br>
interior area of the machine.   This ensures that authorized personnel have<br>
15	gained access to the interior area of the machine by unlocking and opening<br>
the service door before the fascia may be removed.<br>
The components of the machine of the present invention are supported on rollout trays.   The rollout trays are configured so that the components thereon may be moved out of the enclosure through the front<br>
20	opening when the fascia is removed or the rear opening when the service<br>
door is opened.   The rollout trays are preferably arranged in a side-by-side relation so that a service technician may work on components extended on one rollout tray while standing in an area that would be occupied by an adjacent rollout tray when that tray is extended from the machine.   This<br>
25	arrangement enables a service technician to perform the servicing functions<br>
by sequentially extending and retracting the trays without ever having to leave the service footprint of the extended trays.<br><br>

BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OUT INVENTION<br>
Referring now to the drawings and particularly to Figure 1, there is shown therein a preferred embodiment of the automated banking machine of the present invention generally indicated 10.  Automated banking machine 10 comprises an enclosure generally indicated 12.   Enclosure 12 bounds an interior area 14 of the automated banking machine which houses components of the machine.   Enclosure 12 has a front opening generally indicated 16 and a rear opening generally indicated 18.<br>
Enclosure 12 includes a generally rectangular frame 20.   Frame 20 bounds the front opening.   A fascia 22 which serves as a customer interface for the automated banking machine, is removably positioned in frame 20 so as to close front opening 16.<br><br>
In the form of the invention shown in Figure 1, enclosure 12 is comprised of a modular construction including a first enclosure portion 24 and a second enclosure portion 26.   First enclosure portion 24 is comprised of a generally rectangular upper housing 28.   Upper housing 28 is mounted above a secure chest 30, which in the preferred form of the invention is of a safe-like construction.  Secure chest 30 is closed by a safe door 32, the opening of which is controlled by a combination or other high security lock generally indicated 34 (see Figure 2).   Secure chest 30 is used for holding items of value which may be stored within the ATM.   This includes currency or deposits which may be made into the machine by customers. Secure chest 30 includes openings 36 which enable the passage of such items of value to and from the interior of the secure chest.<br>
Upper housing 28 is shown in greater detail in Figure 4.   Upper housing 28 includes a top wall 38 and a pair of spaced side walls 40. Upper housing 28 is of the type disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,483,047.<br>
Upper housing 28 further includes a pair of mounting areas 42 and 44.   Mounting areas 42 and 44 are adapted for connecting to a fixed type rectangular bracket so as to hold frame components thereto in a manner hereafter discussed.   Mounting areas 42 are also of the type that are adapted to accept a rotational bracket thereto which is used in other types of ATM fascias.<br>
Upper housing 28 has a rollout tray 46 therein.   As shown in Figure 2, components of the automated banking machine are supportably mounted on rollout tray 46.   In Figure 2 a customer receipt printer and journal printer assembly generally indicated 48 is supportedly mounted on rollout tray 46.   This component is only exemplary and in embodiments of the invention other types of components which perform other functions may be<br><br>
positioned on tray 46.   This construction enables rollout tray 46 to be moved so as to extend outwardly through the rear opening 18 of the machine.   This makes the component of the machine mounted on tray 46 much more accessible for servicing.<br>
As shown in Figure 2, upper housing 28 includes a further rollout tray 50 which is positioned in side-by-side relation with rollout tray 46. Rollout tray 50 supports a CRT generally indicated 52 and other components thereon.   Rollout tray 50 enables the CRT and other components supported thereon to be moved out the rear opening 18 of the machine supported on the rollout tray for servicing.<br>
It should be understood that while rollout trays 46 and 50 have been discussed with regard to moving out the rear opening 18 of the machine, in other embodiments they may be configured so as to be movable out the front opening 16 of the machine.   Alternatively, in other embodiments one such rollout tray may be arranged to be movable out the front opening and the other movable out the rear opening.   Further, in other embodiments each of the rollout trays may be movable either out the front opening or the rear opening by a service technician.   The determination as to whether the rollout trays are movable out the front or the rear openings will depend on the arrangement of components inside the automated banking machine as well as the space constraints in the area where the machine is located.   For example, in other embodiments of the invention space constraints may dictate that all servicing be done from the front in which case the rollout trays would be arranged to extend from the front of the machine and the safe door of the secure chest 30 would be relocated so as to be either in the front or on a side of the machine.<br><br>
A fundamental advantage of the service configuration shown in Figure 2 is that the amount of floor space required for servicing the machine is minimized.   This is achieved by enabling the technician to extend one of the rollout trays to service components thereon while leaving the other rollout tray within the interior area of the machine.   This enables the service technician to stand in the floor space that would be occupied by the components on the other rollout tray when extended.   When the service technician has completed work on the components on the extended tray, he or she could then return those components by moving them back into the interior area by retracting the rollout tray, move to the floor space previously occupied by the extended tray and extend the adjacent rollout tray to service the components thereon.<br>
It should be understood that while two component holding trays are shown in side-by-side relation in Figure 2, additional component holding trays may be used as later discussed.   Further, all of the component holding trays are configured so as to be moved to extend out of the enclosure 12 to facilitate servicing of components thereon.   Thereafter the components may be returned to the interior area of the machine by retracting the rollout trays.  The rollout trays used in the preferred embodiment of the invention have appropriate latching mechanisms for latching them in the proper operating position when they are retracted from the service position into the machine.<br>
Upper housing 18 has a service door 54 attached thereto in hinged relation.   Service door 54 is selectively movable between an open position shown in Figure 2 wherein access to the components of the machine is provided through rear opening 18.  Service door 54 is also selectively movable to a closed position shown in Figure 3 wherein the rear opening of upper housing 28 is closed.   Service door 54 has a lock 56 in connection<br><br>
therewith.   In the preferred form of the invention lock 56 is a key-type lock which limits access to the interior area 14 of the machine to only authorized personnel.   Second enclosure portion 26 includes an upper service door 58 and a lower service door 60.   Upper and lower service doors 58 and 60 are each controlled by key locks or other conventional type locks.<br>
As shown in Figure 3, upper service door 58 is mounted in hinged relation on second enclosure portion 26 and is selectively movable to an open condition.   In the open condition of service door 58, a rollout tray 62 is movable out of the rear opening 18 of second enclosure portion 26. Rollout tray 62 has components of the automated banking machine supported thereon.   In the preferred form of the invention the components supported on tray 62 are a passbook transport and printer mechanism generally indicated 64.<br>
Lower service door 60 is also movable to an open condition as shown in Figure 3.   In this condition a further rollout tray 66 is movable to extend from the enclosure 12 to facilitate servicing of the components thereon.   In the preferred embodiment of the invention rollout tray 66 supports a check accepter validater generally indicated 68.<br>
Although rollout trays 62 and 66 are shown as extending from the rear opening 18 of the second enclosure portion, it should be understood that in other embodiments of the invention such rollout trays may be configured with components so as to be extendable from a front opening or from both a front opening and a rear opening.   It should further be mentioned that each of rollout trays 62 and 66 are independently movable. This enables the components on one tray to be extended for servicing while the other components remain retracted and out of the way of the service<br><br>
technician.   After servicing the components on the extended tray such tray may be returned to the interior area of the machine and the tray above or below the prior tray extended to service the components thereon.   This arrangement also greatly improves service access and reduces the floor space required for servicing in the same manner as with the trays arranged in a horizontal side-by-side arrangement.<br>
As shown in Figure 7, first enclosure portion 24 and second enclosure portion 26 are held in adjacent relation by fasteners.   A wiring enclosure 69 extends between the enclosure portions.   Second enclosure portion 26 further includes a frame mounting area 70.   Frame mounting area 70 is disposed in opposed relation with mounting area 42 of the first enclosure portion.<br>
As shown in Figure 7, frame 20 includes a first mounting bracket 72 and a second mounting bracket 74.   First mounting bracket is engaged to mounting area 42 by conventional fasteners.   Mounting bracket 74 is engaged to frame mounting area 70 by fasteners.   Frame 20 further includes a central mounting bracket 76.   Central mounting bracket 76 is engaged with mounting area 44 to further hold the frame in engaged relation with the rest of the enclosure.   Frame 20 further includes horizontally extending tabs 78, 80 and 82 through which fasteners extend to engage the frame with the rest of the enclosure.<br>
As shown in Figure 6, frame 16 further includes a trim ring 84. Trim ring 84 is attached to the rest of the frame by channels 86 which extend outward on all sides of the frame.   A gasket 88 comprised of resilient material extends between the channels and the trim ring.<br><br>
Frame 16 includes a lower inside surface 90.   Three latching brackets 92 are mounted to the frame on lower inside surface 90.   Latching brackets 92 are part of a disengageable latch for holding the fascia in engagement with the frame as later discussed in detail.<br>
A first lock 94 is connected to a first lock bracket 96 by fasteners. First lock bracket 96 is in turn attached to first mounting bracket 72.   A second lock 98 is similarly attached to a second lock bracket 100 by fasteners.   Second lock bracket 100 is fastened to second mounting bracket 74.<br>
Lock 94 is connected to a release arm 102.   Release arm 102 extends through openings in arm mounting brackets 104 and 106 which attach to the top wall 38 of first enclosure portion 24.   Release arm 102 is movable in arm mounting brackets 104 and 106 so as to move a release lever 108 on lock 94 (see Figure 8).<br>
Lock 98 has a second release arm 110 similar to release arm 102. Release arm 110 is movably supported in arm mounting brackets 112 and 114 which are mounted to the top wall of second enclosure portion 26. Lock 98 includes a release lever similar to that of lock 94 which engages release arm 110.<br>
The release arms 102 and 110 are connected to locks 94 and 98 respectively, and serve as release members which when actuated unlock the respective lock.   The release arms are positioned in the interior area 14 of the ATM enclosure.   As a result, in order to actuate the release arms of the locks it is necessary to unlock and open both service door 54 of the first enclosure portion 24, as well as upper service door 58 of the second enclosure portion.<br><br>
As first and second locks 94 and 98 are similar in construction, only lock 94 will be described in detail.   A schematic cross sectional view of lock 94 is shown in Figure 13.   The lock includes a slot generally indicated 116.   Slot 116 is sized for releasibly accepting a locking pin which as later discussed, is in fixed connection with the fascia 22.   The lock further includes a latching pawl 120.   Latching pawl 120 is rotatably mounted about a pivot 124 and is biased in a counterclockwise direction as shown by a spring 122.<br>
Latching pawl 120 includes a catch 126 thereon.   Catch 126 is engageable with a lever 128 which is biased to engage the step by a spring 130.   Lever 128 is rotatable about a pivot 132.  Release lever 108 is biased in the clockwise direction as shown in Figure 13 by a spring not shown. Release lever 108 includes a cam surface 134 thereon.<br>
As can be seen with regard to Figure 13, when the locking pin 118 is moved sufficiently into slot 116 the latching pawl 120 is rotated so that lever 128 engages catch 126.   In this position the pin 118 is held by the latching pawl in the slot.   Upon clockwise movement of release lever 108 as shown in Figure 13, lever 128 is rotated in a counterclockwise direction as shown so as to enable latching pawl 120 to rotate in a counterclockwise direction.  The rotation of the latching pawl moves pin 118 out of the slot under the biasing force of spring 122.<br>
It should be understood that the lock shown in Figure 13 is only exemplary.   Other types of locks may be used in embodiments of the invention as part of the disengageable latch for holding the fascia in engagement with the enclosure.   Further, in alternative embodiments the positions of the locking pins and locks may be reversed wherein the locks<br><br>
are supported on the fascia and the locking pins are supported on the frame or the enclosure.<br>
The construction of fascia 22 is shown in greater detail with regard to Figure 5.   Fascia 16 includes a customer interface panel 136.   Customer interface panel 136 has supported thereon customer input devices such as a keyboard 138 and function buttons 140.   Function buttons 140 are positioned adjacent to a screen opening 142 tlirough which the screen of the CRT may be viewed by a customer when the fascia and CRT are in the operative positions.  The customer interface panel 136 further includes a number of openings for passing items therethrough to other components of the machine.  The openings are used to pass items such as credit and debit cards, deposits, cash, checks and passbooks.   Each of the various openings in the customer interface panel 136 generally has a sensor or other indicators adjacent thereto for sensing the passage of items through the opening.  As later discussed, these sensors are mounted in supported connection with the fascia as are the input devices.<br>
As shown in Figure 5, a pair of side panels 144 and 146 are attached to the sides of the customer interface panel 136.   Side panel 144 has an outward extending lip 148 extending along the front thereof. Similarly, side panel 146 has an outward extending lip 150 extending outwardly therefrom.<br>
A lower panel 152 is attached by fasteners to the bottom of the customer interface panel 136.   Lower panel 152 extends between the side panels 144 and 146 and is attached thereto by fasteners as shown.   Lower panel 142 further includes an outward extending lip 154 thereon.<br><br>
A top panel 156 is attached to the top of the customer interface panel 136 by fasteners.   Top panel 156 is also attached to the tops of the side panels 144 and 146.   Top panel 156 further includes an outward extending lip 158 at the front thereof.   Panel 156 further includes spaced recesses generally indicated 160 that extend in the exterior surface thereof. Recesses 160 do not extend through the top panel 156 but rather serve as fingerholds to facilitate manually engaging the panel.   The lips of the four panels surrounding panel 136 form a generally continuous outward extending lip which extends about a periphery of the fascia.<br>
Top panel 156 further includes a pair of spaced ears 162 at the sides thereof. Ears 162 extend inwardly in the interior area of the enclosure. A locking pin 118 is mounted on each of ears 162.<br>
The locking pins 118 along with locks 94 and 98 previously discussed, form part of a disengageable latch for the fascia 22.   As shown in Figure 9, the ears 162 on top panel 156 extend inboard of the locks. The pins attached to the ears are aligned with the slots of the locks such as slot 118 of lock 94 shown.  When the fascia 22 is in its fully extended position within the frame 20, locking pins 118 extend sufficiently into the slots so as to rotate the latching pawls.   This holds both locking pins 118 in locked relation in the locks.   The latching pins remain engaged with the locks until each of the release levers<br>
108 and 110 are actuated so as to enable the top of the fascia to be moved to an outward position as shown in Figure 9.<br>
The preferred embodiment of the disengageable latch of the present invention further includes a first projecting bracket 164 which is attached to a lower portion of the back of customer interface panel 136 as shown in<br><br>
Figure 10.   A second projecting bracket 166 is attached to the back of the customer interface panel in a similar manner.<br>
As shown in Figures 11 and 12, first and second projecting brackets 164 and 166 are operative to hold fascia 22 positioned in the frame by engagement with latching brackets 92. Each of the latching brackets 92 include a recess 168.   A ramp portion 170 extends outwardly of recess 168 towards the front of the frame 20.<br>
As shown in Figures 11 and 12, the downwardly extending projections of first projecting bracket 164 and second projecting bracket 166 are movable into engagement with the recesses 168 of latching brackets 92.   This is preferably accomplished by engaging the lip 154 of the lower panel 152 with the outer surface of the frame, channel and trim ring assembly (see Figure 14).   The fascia is then rotated into position such that the projections engage the recesses 168 in the latching brackets.   As the projections engage the recesses the locking pins 118 rotate into engagement with the locks 94 and 98 as shown in Figure 9.   The ramps 170 being outwardly positioned of the recesses facilitate engagement of the projections in the recesses by avoiding snagging and by enabling the projecting brackets 164 and 166 to be slid up the ramps 170 of the latching brackets 92.<br>
With the projecting brackets 164 and 166 engaged in the recesses 168 of the latching brackets and the locking pins 118 engaged in the locks 94 and 98, the fascia is held securely in position extending within frame 20.   The fascia is held in this position until it is desired to remove it.   To remove the fascia the service doors 54 and 58 must be unlocked and moved to an open condition sufficient to enable access to release arms 102 and 110.   Moving the release arms rearwardly unlocks the locks and rotates the<br><br>
latching pawls thereof so as to push the locking pins 118 outward.   The locking pins are biased outwardly by the springs that are in operative connection with the latching pawls.   With the fascia moved outwardly generally to the position shown in Figure 9, a service technician may engage his or her fingers in the recesses 160 of the top panel 156 so as to move the top of the panel outwardly.   The technician rotates the fascia to disengage projecting brackets 164 and 166 from the recesses in latching brackets 92.   This enables the fascia to be moved outwardly from the front opening 16.<br>
It should be understood that while in the preferred embodiment the projections and the projecting brackets are fixed relative to the fascia, and the interengaging recesses which accept the projections are fixed relative to the enclosure, in other embodiments other arrangements may be used including the reverse of the arrangement of the preferred embodiment.<br>
As shown in Figure 10, the input devices, sensors and other electrical items that are mounted on the interior of the customer interface panel are connected through a wiring harness with releasible connectors 172, 174 and 176 thereon.   The releasible connectors are  enabled to be disengaged from mating connectors inside the machine so as to enable the fascia to be removed from the machine entirely.   This fully opens the front opening 16 of both enclosure portions 24 and 26 so as to provide service access and enable the rollout trays and serviceable components thereon to be extended out the front opening.<br>
A further advantage associated with having a fully removable fascia is the ability to easily test and replace the input devices, sensors and other electrical devices mounted thereon.   This is achieved because with the fascia removed ready access is available to the components and fasteners on<br><br>
the fascia panel.   In addition, the input devices, sensors and other electrical components on the fascia panel may be readily tested.   This is done either through testing or by connecting the releasible connectors 172, 174 or 176 to the mating connectors in the interior area 14 with jumper cables.   This enables the service technician to operate the input devices, sensors and other electrical devices and observe the operation of the machine components in the interior area of the machine through the front opening or to test the functioning of such components with test equipment.   This facilitates trouble shooting of the machine.<br>
It should be understood that while in the embodiment of the invention shown herein the second enclosure portion 26 has been added to the first enclosure portion, other embodiments of the invention may be comprised of a frame corresponding in size to only the first enclosure portion.   Such an enclosure would still provide the benefits of the present invention including a removable front fascia which provides access to the interior area of the enclosure through both a front opening or a rear opening.<br>
Alternative embodiments of the invention may also include a second enclosure portion identical to the first enclosure portion which includes a second secure chest.   Such an enclosure would provide a double wide machine and additional space for holding valuable items such as cash or deposits.   Such a machine may be readily accommodated by adjusting the size of the frame and fascia portions to correspond to the width of the enclosure.   Likewise, machine enclosures corresponding to various combinations of first and second enclosure portions may be made.   This enables structuring an enclosure so as to meet the needs and requirements of the particular components that are to be housed in the machine and which require periodic servicing.<br><br>
Thus, the new automated teller machine with improved service access of the present invention achieves the above-stated objectives, eliminates difficulties encountered in the use of prior devices and systems, solves problems and attains the desirable results described herein.<br>
In the foregoing description certain terms have been used for brevity, clarity and understanding, however no unnecessary limitations are to be implied therefrom because such terms are for descriptive purposes and are intended to be broadly construed.   Moreover, the descriptions and illustrations given herein are by way of examples and the invention is not limited to the exact details shown and described.   Further, in the following claims any feature described as a means for performing a function shall be construed as encompassing any means capable of performing the function and not merely the means used in the foregoing described embodiment or mere equivalents.<br>
Having described the features, discoveries and principles of the invention, the manner in which it is constructed and operated and the advantages and useful results attained, the new and useful structures, devices, elements, arrangements, parts, combinations, systems, equipment, operations and relationships are set forth in the appended claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
