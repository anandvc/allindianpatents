				<td>A DIELECTRICALLY-LOADED ANTENNA<br>
This invention relates to a dielectrically-loaded antenna for operation at frequencies in<br>
excess of 200MHz, and in particular to a loop antenna having a plurality of resonant<br>
frequencies within a band of operation.<br>
A dielectrically-loaded loop antenna is disclosed in British Patent Application No.<br>
2309592A. Whilst this antenna has advantageous properties in terms of isolation from<br>
the structure on which it is mounted, its radiation pattern, and specific absorption ratio<br>
(SAR) performance when used on, for instance, a mobile telephone close to the user's<br>
head, it suffers from the generic problem of small antennas that it has insufficient<br>
bandwidth for many applications. Improved bandwidth can be achieved by splitting the<br>
radiating elements of the antenna into portions having different electrical lengths. For<br>
example, as disclosed in British Patent Application No. 2321785A, the individual<br>
helical radiating elements can each be replaced by a pair of mutually adjacent,<br>
substantially parallel, radiating elements connected at different positions to a linking<br>
conductor linking opposed radiating elements. In another vanation, disclosed in British<br>
Patent Application No. 2351850A, the single helical elements are replaced by laterally<br>
opposed groups of elements, each group having a pair of coextensive mutually adjacent<br>
radiating elements in the form of parallel tracks having different widths to yield<br>
differing electrical lengths. These variations on the theme of a dielectrically-loaded<br>
twisted loop antenna gain advantages in terms of bandwidth by virtue of their different<br>
coupled modes of resonance which, occur at different frequencies within a required<br>
band of operation.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a further improvement in bandwidth.<br>
According to this invention, there is provided a dielectrically-loaded loop antenna for<br>
operation at frequencies in excess of 200MHz, comprising an electrically insulative<br>
core of a solid material having a relative dielectric constant greater than 5, a feed<br>
connection, and an antenna element structure disposed on or adjacent the outer surface<br>
of the core, the material of the core occupying the major part of the volume defined by<br>
the core outer surface, wherein the antenna element structure comprises a pair of<br>
laterally opposed groups of conductive elongate elements, group comprising first<br>
and second substantially coextensive elongate elements which have different electrical<br>
lengths at a frequency within an operating frequency band of the antenna and are<br>
coupled together at respective first ends at a location in the region of the feed<br>
connection and at respective second ends at a location spaced from the feed connection,<br>
the antenna element structure further comprising a linking conductor linking the second<br>
ends of the first and second elongate elements of one group with the second ends of the<br>
first and second elements of the other group, whereby the first elements of the two<br>
groups form part of a First looped conductive path, and the second elements of the two<br>
groups form part of a second looped conductive path, such that the said paths have<br>
different respective resonant frequencies within the said band and each extend from the<br>
feed connection to the linking conductor, and then back to the feed connection, wherein<br>
at least one of the said elongate antenna elements comprises a conductive strip having<br>
non-parallel edges.<br>
Looked at a different way, the invention provides an antenna in which at least one of<br>
the said elongate antenna elements comprises a conductive strip on the outer surface of<br>
the core, which strip has opposing edges of different lengths.<br>
Preferably, the edge of the strip which is furthest from the other elongate element or<br>
elements in its.group is longer than the edge which is nearer the other element or<br>
elements. Indeed, both the first and second elongate elements of each group may have<br>
edges of different lengths, e.g., in that each such element which has an edge forming an<br>
outermost edge of the group is configured such that the outermost edge is longer than<br>
the inner edge of the element<br>
Such differences in edge length may be obtained by forming each affected element so<br>
that one of its edges follows a wavy or meandered path along substantially the whole of<br>
its radiating length. Thus, in the case of the antenna being a twisted loop antenna, with<br>
each group of elements executing a half turn around the central axis of a cylindrical<br>
dielectric core, the helical portion of each element has one edge which follows a strict<br>
helical path, whilst the other edge follows a path which deviates from the strict helical<br>
path in a sinusoid, castellated or smooth pattern,for example.<br>
Advantageously, where both outermost edges of each group of elements follow a path<br>
which varies from the strict helix, the variations are equal for both edges at any given<br>
position along the length of the group of elements so that the overall width of the group<br>
at any given position is substantially the same. Indeed, the outermost edges may be<br>
formed so as to be parallel along at least a major part of the length of the group of<br>
elements.<br>
Such structures take advantage of the discovery by the applicant that grouped and<br>
substantially coextensive radiating elements of different electrical lengths have<br>
fundamental modes of resonance corresponding not only to the individual elements<br>
which are close together, but also corresponding to the elements as a combination.<br>
Accordingly, where each group of elements has two substantially coextensive mutually<br>
adjacent elongate radiating elements, there exists a fundamental mode of resonance<br>
associated with one ot the tracks, another tundametal resonance associated with the<br>
other of the tracks, and a third fundamental resonance associated with the composite<br>
element represented by the two tracks together. The frequency of the third resonance<br>
can be manipulated by asymmetrically altering the lengths of edges of the elements. In<br>
particular, by lengthening the outer edges of the two elements of each group, the<br>
frequency of the third resonance can be altered differently, and to a greater degree, than<br>
the resonant frequencies associated with the individual tracks. It will be appreciated,<br>
therefore, that, the third frequency of resonance can be brought close to the other<br>
resonant frequencies so that all three couple together to form a wider band of reduced<br>
insertion loss than can be achieved with the above-described prior art antennas, at least<br>
for a given resonance type (i.e., in this case, the balanced modes of resonance in the<br>
preferred antenna).<br>
An antenna as described above, having groups of laterally opposed elongate antenna<br>
elements with each group having two mutually adjacent such elements, is one preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention. In that case, the elongate elements of each pair have<br>
different electrical lengths and define between them a parallel sided channel, each<br>
element having a meandered outer edge.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, each group of elongate antenna elements has three<br>
elongate elements, arranged side-by-side. In this case, each group comprises an inner<br>
element and two outer elements. Preferably, the outwardly directed edges of the two<br>
outer elements of each group are meandered or otherwise caused to deviate from a path<br>
parallel to the corresponding inner edges, and the inner element is parallel-sided. More<br>
preferably, at least one of the outer elements of each group has a deviating outer edge<br>
and a deviating inner edge, the amplitude of the outer edge deviation being greater than<br>
the amplitude of the inner edge deviation.<br>
Using groups of two elements with non-parallel edges it is possible to achieve a<br>
fractional bandwidth in excess of 3% at an insertion loss of-6dB. Embodiments with<br>
three or more elements per group offer further bandwidth gains, in terms of fractional<br>
bandwidth and/or insertion loss.<br>
The antennas described above have particular application in the frequency division<br>
duplex portion of the IMT-2000 3-G receive and transmit bands (2110-2170MHz and<br>
1920-1980MHz). They can also be applied to other mobile communication bands such<br>
as the GSM-1800 band (1710-1880MHz), the PCS1900 band (1850-1990MHz) and the<br>
Bluetooth LAN band (2401-2480MHz).<br>

resonances of the antenna of Figures 5A to 5C; and<br>
Figure 7 is a graph indicating the resonances which may be obtained with an antenna of<br>
the kind shown in Figures 5A to 5C.<br>
Referring to Figure 1, an antenna of a construction similar to that shown in British<br>
Patent Application No. 2351850A has an antenna element structure comprising a pair<br>
of laterally opposed groups 10AB, 10CD of elongate radiating antenna elements 10AB,<br>
10CD. The term "radiating" is used in this specification to describe antenna elements<br>
which, when the antenna is connected to a source of radio frequency energy, radiate<br>
energy into the space around the antenna. It will be understood that, in the context of<br>
an antenna for receiving radio frequency signals, the term "radiating elements" refers to<br>
elements which couple energy from the space surrounding the antenna to the<br>
conductors of the antenna for feeding to a receiver.<br>
Each group of elements comprises, in this embodiment, two coextensive, mutually<br>
adjacent and generally parallel elongate antenna elements 10A, 10B, 10C, 10D which<br>
are disposed on the outer cylindrical surface of an antenna core 12 made of a ceramic<br>
dielectric material having an relative dielectric constant greater than 5, typically 36 or<br>
Higher. The core 12 has an axial passage 14 with an inner metallic lining, the passage<br>
14 housing an axial inner feeder conductor 16 surrounded by a dielectric insulating<br>
sheath 17. The inner conductor 16 and the lining together form a coaxial feeder<br>
structure which passes axially through the core 12 from a distal end face 12D of the<br>
core to emerge as a coaxial transmission line 18 from a proximal end face 12P of the<br>
core 12. The antenna element structure includes corresponding radial elements 10AR,<br>
10BR, 10CR, 10DR formed as conductive tracks on the distal end face 12D connecting<br>
distal ends of the elements 10A to 10D to the feeder structure. The elongate radiating<br>
elements 10A to 10D, including their corresponding radial portions, are of<br>
approximately the same physical length, and each includes a helical conductive, track<br>
executing a half turn around the axis of the core 12. Each group of elements comprises<br>
a first element 10A, 10C one width.and,a second element 10B, 10D of a different<br>
width. These differences in width cause differences in electrical lengths, due to the<br>
differences in wave velocity along the elements,<br>
To form complete conductive loops, each antenna element 10A to 10D is connected to<br>
the rim 20U of a common virtual ground conductor in the form of a conductive sleeve<br>
20 surrounding a proximal end portion of the core 12 as a link conductor for the<br>
elements 10A to 10D. The sleeve 20 is, in turn, connected to the lining of the axial<br>
passage 14 by conductive plating on the proximal end face 12D of the core 12. Thus, a<br>
first 360 degrees conductive loop is formed by elements 10AR, 10A, rim 20U, and<br>
elements 1OC and 10CR, and a second 360 degree conductive loop is formed by<br>
elements 10BR, 10B, the rim 20U, and elements 10D and 10DR. Each loop extends<br>
from one conductor or tne reeaer structure around the core to the other conductor of the<br>
feeder structure. The resonant frequency if one loop is slightly different from that of<br>
the other.<br>
At any given transverse cross-section through the antenna, the first and second antenna<br>
elements of the first group 10AB are substantially diametrically opposed to the<br>
corresponding first and second elements, respectively, of the second group 10C. It will<br>
be noted that, owing to each helical portion representing a half turn around the axis of<br>
the core 12, the first ends of the helical portions of each conductive loop are<br>
approximately in the same plane as their second ends, the plane being a plane including<br>
the axis of the core 12. Additionally it should be noted that the circumferential spacing,<br>
i.e. the spacing around the core, between the neighbouring elements of each group is<br>
less than that between the groups. Thus, elements 10A and 10B are closer to each other<br>
than they are to the elements 10C, 10D.<br>
The conductive sleeve 20 covers a proximal portion of the antenna core 12, surrounding<br>
the feeder structure 18, the material of the core filing substantially the whole of the<br>
space between the sleeve 20 and the metallic lining of the axial passage 14. The<br>
combination of the sleeve 20 and plating forms a balun so that signals in the<br>
transmission line formed by the feeder structure 18 are converted between an<br>
unbalanced state at the proximal end of the antenna and a balanced state at an axial<br>
position above the plane of the upper edge 20U of the sleeve 20. To achieve this effect,<br>
the axial length of the sleeve is such that, in the presence of an underlying core material<br>
of relatively high dielectric constant, the balun has an electrical length of about ? /4 or<br>
90° in the operating frequency band of the antenna. Since the core material of the<br>
antenna has a foreshortening effect, the annular space surrounding the inner conductor<br>
is filled with an insulating dielectric material having a relatively small dielectric<br>
constant, the feeder structure 18 distally of the sleeve has a short electrical length. As a<br>
result, signals at the distal end of the feeder structure 18 are at least approximately<br>
balanced. A further effect of the sleeve 20 is that for frequencies in the region of the<br>
operating frequency of the antenna, the rim 20U of the sleeve 20 is effectively isolated<br>
from the ground represented by the outer conductor of the feeder structure. This means<br>
that currents circulating between the antenna elements 10A to 10D are confined<br>
substantially to the rim part. The sleeve thus acts as an isolating trap when the antenna<br>
is resonant in a balanced mode.<br>
Since the first and second antenna elements of each group 10AB, 10CD are formed<br>
having different electrical lengths at a given frequency, the conductive loops formed by<br>
the elements also have different electrical lengths. As a result, the antenna resonates at<br>
two different resonant frequencies, the actual frequencies depending, in this case, on the<br>
widths of the elements. As Figure 1 shows, the generally parallel elements of each<br>
group extend from the region of the feed connection on the distal end face of the core to<br>
the rim 20U of the balun sleeve 20, thus defining an inter-element channel 11AB,<br>
11CD, or slit, between the elements of each group.<br>
The length of the channels are arranged to achieve substantial isolation of the<br>
conductive paths from one another at their respective resonant frequencies. This is<br>
achieved by forming the channels with an electrical length of ? /2, or n? /2 where n is an<br>
odd integer. In effect, therefore, the electrical lengths of each of those edges of the<br>
conductors 10A to 10D bounding the channels 11AB, 11CD are also ? /2 or n? /2. At a<br>
resonant frequency of one of the conductive loops, a standing wave is set up over the<br>
entire length of the resonant loop, with equal values of voltage being present at<br>
locations adjacent the ends of each ? /2 channel, i.e. in the regions of the ends of the<br>
antenna elements. When one of the loops is resonating, the antenna elements which<br>
form part of the non-resonating loop are isolated from the adjacent resonating elements,<br>
since equal voltages at either ends of the non-resonant elements result in zero current<br>
flow. When the other conductive path is resonant, the other loop is likewise isolated<br>
from the resonating loop. To summarise, at the resonant frequency of one of the<br>
conductive paths, excitation occurs in that path simultaneously with isolation from the<br>
other path. It follows that at least two quite distinct resonances are achieved at different<br>
frequencies due to the fact that each branch loads the conductive path of the other only<br>
minimally when the other is at resonance. In effect, two or more mutually isolated low<br>
impedance paths are formed around the core.<br>
The channels 11AB, 11CD are located in the main between the antenna elements 10A,<br>
10B and 10C, 10D respectively, and by a relatively small distance into the sleeve 20.<br>
Typically, for each channel, the length of the channel part is located between the<br>
elements would be no less than 0.7L, where L is the total physical length of the<br>
channel.<br>
Other features of the antenna of Figure 1 are described in the above-mentioned British<br>
Patent Applications Nos. 2351850A and 2309592A, the disclosures of which are<br>
incorporated in this application by reference.<br>
The applicants have discovered that the antenna of Figure 1 exhibits three fundamental<br>
balanced mode resonances. Referring to Figure 2, which includes a graph plotting<br>
insertion loss (S11) with frequency and also shows a portion of one of the groups of<br>
antenna elements 10A, 10B where they meet the rim 20U of the sleeve 20 (see Figure<br>
1). Each individual element 10A, 10B gives rise to a respective resonance 30A, 30B.<br>
The electrical lengths of the elements are such that these resonances are close together<br>
and are coupled. Each of these resonances has an associated current in the respective<br>
radiating element 10A, 10B which, in turn, induces a respective magnetic field 32A,<br>
32B around the element 10A, 10B and passing through the slit 11AB, as shown in<br>
Figure 2. The applicants have discovered that there exists a third mode of resonance,<br>
which is also a balanced mode resonance, with an associated current which is common<br>
to both elements 10A, 10B and which has an associated induced magnetic field 32C<br>
that encircles the group 10AB of elements 10A, 10B without passing through the<br>
channel or slit 11AB between the two elements 10A, 10B.<br>
The coupling between the resonances 30A, 30B due to the individual tracks can be<br>
adjusted by adjusting the length of the channel 11AB which isolates the two tracks<br>
from each other. In general, this involves forming the channel so that it passes a short<br>
distance into the sleeve 20. This yields circumstances that permit each helical element<br>
10A, 10B to behave as a half wave resonant line, current fed at the distal end face of the<br>
core 12 (Figure 1) and short circuited at the other end, i.e., the end where it meets the<br>
rim 20U of the sleeve 20, such that either (a) resonant currents can exist on any one<br>
element or (b) no currents exist due to the absence of drive conditions.<br>
As explained above, the frequencies of the resonances associated with the individual<br>
elements 10A, 1 OB are determined by the respective track widths which, in turn, set the<br>
wave velocities of the signals that they carry.<br>
The applicants have found that it is possible to vary the frequency of the third<br>
resonance 30C differently from the frequencies of the individual element resonances<br>
30A, 30B.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, this is done by forming the<br>
helical elements 10A, 10B, 10C and 10D such that their outermost edges are meandered<br>
with respect to their respective helical paths, as shown in Figures 3A to 3C. As will be<br>
seen from Figures 3C, the outwardly directed edge 10AO, 10BO, 10CO, 10DO of each<br>
helical element 10A to 10D deviates from the helical path in a sinusoidal manner along<br>
the whole of its length. The inner edges of the elements 10A to 10D are, in this<br>
embodiment, strictly helical and parallel to each other on opposite sides of the<br>
respective channel 11AB, 11CD. The sinusoidal paths of the outermost edges of the<br>
elements of each group are also parallel. This is because at any given point along the<br>
elements 10A, 10B or 1OC, 10D of a group, the deviations of the respective outermost<br>
edges are in the same direction. The deviations also have the same pitch and the same<br>
amplitude.<br>
The effect of the meandering of the outermost edges of the elements 10A, 10B, 10C,<br>
10D is to shift the natural frequency of the common-current mode down to a frequency<br>
which depends on the amplitude of the meandering. In effect, the common-current<br>
resonant mode which produces resonance 30C (Figure 2) has its highest current density<br>
at the outermost edges 10AO to 10DO, and altering the amplitude of the meandering<br>
tunes the frequency of the resonance 30C at a faster rate than the frequencies of the<br>
individual elements (i.e. the resonances 30A, 30B in Figure 2). This is because, as will<br>
be seen from Figure 2, when compared with Figure 3C, the currents associated with the<br>
common-current mode, producing resonance 30C, are guided along two meandering<br>
edges 10AO, 10BO; 10CO, 10DO, rather than along one meandered edge and one<br>
straight edge as in the case of the individual elements 10A to 10D.<br>
This variation in the length of the outermost edges of the elements 10A to 10D can be<br>
used to shift the third resonance 30C closer to the resonances 30A and 30B, as shown in<br>
Figure 4, to produce an advantageous insertion loss characteristic covering a band of<br>
frequencies. In the particular example shown in Figure 6, the antenna has an operating<br>
band coincident with the IMT-2000 3-G receive band of 2110 to 2170MHz, and a<br>
fractional bandwidth approaching 3% at -9dB has been achieved.<br>
In an alternative embodiment of the invention, each group of antenna elements may<br>
comprise three elongate elements 10E, 10F, 10G, 10H, 10I and 10J, as shown in<br>
Figures 5A to 5C, which are views corresponding to the views of Figures 3A to 3C in<br>
respective of the first embodiment.<br>
As before, each element has a corresponding radial portion 10ER to 10JR connecting to<br>
the feeder structure, and each element is terminated at the rim 20U of the sleeve 20.<br>
The elements within each group 10E, 10F, 10G; 10H, 10I, 10J are separated from each<br>
other by half wave channels 11EF, 11FG; 11HI, 11IJ which, as in the first embodiment,<br>
extends from the distal face 12D of the core into the sleeve 20, as shown.<br>
In addition, as in the embodiment of Figures 3A to 3C, the elements in each group are<br>
of different average widths, each element within each group having an element of a<br>
corresponding width in the other group, elements of equal average width being<br>
diametrically opposed across the core on opposite sides of the core axis. In this case,<br>
the narrowest elements are elements 10ER and 10HR. The next wider elements are<br>
those labelled 10GR and 10JR, and the widest elements are the elements in the middle<br>
of their respective groups, elements 10FR and 10IR.<br>
Referring to the diagram of Figure 6, it will be seen that, in addition to the currents in<br>
the individual elements of each group, giving rise to correspondingly induced magnetic<br>
fields 30D, 30E, and 30F, the three-element structure offers shared current modes<br>
associated with currents common to respective pairs of elements (producing magnetic<br>
fields 30G and 30H) and currents common to all three elements (producing a magnetic<br>
field appearing in Figure 6 as field 30I). It follows that this antenna offers six<br>
fundamental balanced mode resonances which, with appropriate adjustment of the<br>
widths of the elements 10E to 10J and meandering of element edges, can be brought<br>
together as a collection of coupled resonances, as shown in Figure 7. In this case, the<br>
antenna is configured to produce resonances forming an operating band corresponding<br>
to the GSM 1800 band extending from 1710 to 1880 MHz.<br>
Referring back to Figure 5C, it will be seen that in this embodiment, the outer elements<br>
of each group have their outermost edges meandered. In practice, the inner edges of the<br>
outer elements 10E, 10G; 10H, 10J may also be meandered, but to a lesser amplitude<br>
than the meandering of the outer edges. The edges of the inner elements 10F, 10I are<br>
helical in this case.<br>
While the bandwidth of an antenna can be increased using the techniques described<br>
above, some applications may require still greater bandwidth. For instance, the 3-G<br>
receive and transmit bands as specified by the IMT-2000 frequency allocation are<br>
neighbouring bands which, depending on the performance required, may not be covered<br>
by a single antenna. Since dielectrically-loaded antennas as described above are very<br>
small at the frequencies of the 3-G bands, it is possible to mount a plurality of such<br>
antennas in a single mobile telephone handset. The antennas described above are<br>
balanced mode antennas which, in use, are isolated from the handset ground. It is<br>
possible to employ a first antenna covering the transmit band and a second antenna<br>
covering the receive band, each having a filtering response (as shown in the graphs<br>
included in the drawings of the present application) to reject the other band. This<br>
allows the expensive diplexer filter of the conventional approach in this situation (i.e. a<br>
broadband antenna and a diplexer) to be dispensed with.<br>
