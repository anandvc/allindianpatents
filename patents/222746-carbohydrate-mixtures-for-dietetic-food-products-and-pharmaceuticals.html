				<td>CARBOHYDRATE MIXTURES<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
The invention relates to carbohydrate mixtures for dietetic foods and<br>
pharmaceuticals, dietetic and pharmaceutical compositions containing said<br>
carbohydrate mixtures, and to the use of said carbohydrate mixtures for<br>
stimulating the human large intestinal flora.<br>
As is generally known, carbohydrates represent one of the essential foundations<br>
of nutrition. This is the reason why the most differing carbohydrates are admixed<br>
to the most differing foods and also to pharmaceuticals. The task of the<br>
carbohydrates therefore is primarily of the nutritive kind, and they serve as<br>
roughage respectively.<br>
Carbohydrates consist of monosaccharides, and are respectively composed<br>
thereof. Depending on their polymerization degree, the carbohydrates are<br>
indicated as oligosaccharides or polysaccharides or glycans respectively. (The<br>
carbohydrates thereby are present as free oligosaccharides, as well as in a<br>
bonded form such as for example in glycoproteins, proteoglycans and glycolipids.<br>
Due to the variability of the monomers forming the carbohydrates, and due to the<br>
position of the glycosidic bond and the anomeric state of the carbohydrates and<br>
their conjugates, said carbohydrates and their conjugates represent an extremely<br>
heterogeneous and extensive substance class.<br>
Carbohydrates have most differing biological functions. Thus, they influence, for<br>
example, the bacterial colonization of the large intestine, which is a prerequisite<br>
for its normal function. The microflora of the large intestine takes part in the<br>
intestinal functions in a very complex manner. This influence is preponderantly<br>
exercised by the fermentation of food components, which have not been<br>
resorbed in the small intestine. The fermentation encompasses a plurality of<br>
functions such as the further digestion of these food components, the<br>
detoxification of endogenously occurring metabolites, the synthesis of new<br>
metabolites, some of them having a very specific effect, the return resorption of<br>
bile acids, and many other processes. The normal microflora also has a health-<br>
promoting effect in that it suppresses the growth of other pathogenous<br>
microorganisms.<br>
Bacteria, which produce lactic acid as their most important final metabolite (so-<br>
called lactic acid-producing bacteria), play an essential role as the important<br>
representatives of the normal microflora of the large intestine. Examples for this<br>
group are bacteria of the lactobacillus and bifidobacterium genus. Therefore,<br>
efforts have been undertaken for an extended period of time on ways to control<br>
the development of a lactic acid-dominant intestinal flora by means of dietetic<br>
measures. This is particularly important in cases when a normal intestinal flora is<br>
not present or not sufficiently present due to processes caused by the<br>
development such as, for example, of new born babies or due to pathogenous<br>
states such as, for example, subsequent to an enteral antibiotic therapy or<br>
another drug therapy or during and after enteral infections.<br>
Carbohydrates are now increasingly used in food, "functional food" and<br>
pharmaceuticals under the aspect of a biological efficiency. Thus, it is, for<br>
example, known that some carbohydrates exercise a growth-promoting effect<br>
upon various species of bifidobacteria, but also upon lactobacilli. Thus, galacto<br>
oligosaccharides, for example, have a growth-promoting effect upon lactobacillus<br>
casei. To date, however, only very specific species of carbohydrates having<br>
determined properties are used for promoting certain biological actions.<br>
Thus, WO 98/26787, for example, describes the use of ß-glucan and compounds<br>
derived thereof for the promotion of the population of lactic acid-producing<br>
microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tracts of human beings and animals.<br>
Mixtures may also be used, which contain further prebiotic substances, the latter<br>
not being specified in detail.<br>
Moreover, mixtures are known from WO 96/13271 which contain various<br>
oligosaccharides and polysaccharides apart from immunoglobulins. These<br>
mixtures are used as a dietetic supplement, which, with oral administration, is<br>
supposed to be active against various gastrointestinal pathogens. The<br>
saccharides used are thereby indicated as soluble dietetic fibre, whereby it<br>
concerns inulin, fructo-oligosaccharides, pectin, guar gum and mixtures thereof.<br>
In EP 0 756 828 A1, fibre-containing nutrient compositions are described, which<br>
contain in addition to oligosaccharides and/or starch, soluble polysacchararides<br>
not representing starch and insoluble polysaccharides not representing starch.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide improved carbohydrate<br>
mixtures, which may be incorporated in dietetic nutritions and pharmaceuticals,<br>
and which, in addition to their nutritive effect, also stimulate health-promoting<br>
microorganisms present in the natural flora of the large intestine.<br>
This object is solved by means of carbohydrate mixtures according to the<br>
teaching of the present claims.<br>
Thus, the carbohydrate mixtures according to the present invention, contain at<br>
least two different, essentially soluble carbohydrate components A and B, which<br>
remain undigested in the gastrointestinal tract and reaph the large intestine<br>
unresorbed. The carbohydrate mixtures according to the present invention may<br>
also consist exclusively of these two carbohydrate components A and B.<br>
Carbohydrate component A thereby consists of at least one monosaccharide or<br>
from at least one oligosaccharide. Oligosaccharides are thereby understood as<br>
those comprising of 2 to 7 monosaccharide units. Hence, the oligosaccharides<br>
refer to disaccharides, trisaccharides, tetrasaccharides, pentasaccharides and<br>
hexaasaccharides. Carbohydrate component A may also be formed by a<br>
compound of two or more of the mentioned saccharides. It may therefore be<br>
comprised of only one monosaccharide or of a mixture of two or more<br>
monosaccharides or of a mixture of one or more monosaccharide/s with one or<br>
more oligosaccharide/s. It may also be comprised of any arbitrary number of<br>
various monosaccharides and/or oligosaccharides of that kind.<br>
Carbohydrate component B consists of at least one polvsaccharide comprising 7<br>
or more monosaccharide units. Polysaccharides are understood as those starting<br>
from heptasaccharide (e.g. heptasaccharide, oktasaccharide, nonasaccharide,<br>
decasaccharid, etc.). Carbohydrate component B, may also be comprised of only<br>
one polysaccharide of that kind or of any arbitrary number of polysaccharides of<br>
that kind.<br>
Accordingly, when in the following or in the claims, a carbohydrate component A<br>
or B is mentioned, it may refer to any one of all of these variants.<br>
Carbohydrate component A thereby represents up to 95 wt-% of the sum of<br>
carbohydrate component A and carbohydrate component"B (A + B = 100 wt-%).<br>
Carbohydrate component B fepresents 5 to 95 wt-% of the sum of carbohydrate<br>
component A and carbohydrate component B.<br>
At least 80 wt-% of the carbohydrates or saccharides out of the sum of<br>
carbohydrate component A and B thereby have a prebiotic effect. Preferably, at<br>
least 80 wt-% of the carbohydrates belonging to carbohydrate component A, and<br>
also at least 80 wt-% of those belonging to carbohydrate component B, have a<br>
prebiotic effect. In other words, preferably at least 80 wt-% each of the<br>
carbohydrates or saccharides out of carbohydrate components A and B, are<br>
intended to reach the large intestine in an undigested (hence not resorbable in<br>
the small intestine) manner. In other words, these carbohydrates or saccharides<br>
of carbohydrate components A and B in the gastrointestinal tract are neither<br>
resorbed and digested in the stomach nor in the small intestine, but reach the<br>
large intestine as such.<br>
The proportion of the not prebioticaliy active carbohydrates or saccharides of<br>
carbohydrate components A and B therewith amounts to a maximum of 20 wt-%.<br>
These carbohydrates or saccharides refer to those, which are actually soluble,<br>
but can be excreted in an undigested form. These carbohydrates can exercise a<br>
physical effect in that they increase, for example, the volume of the faeces or<br>
prompt a water adsorption.<br>
Soluble carbohydrates in the sense of the present invention are understood as<br>
those, which form a homogenous solution in the physical sense in water, in a<br>
concentration of at least 1 g/l at room temperature (e.g. pursuant to Roempp's<br>
Chemie Lexikon).<br>
Such as it has already been stated, the inventive carbohydrate mixtures may<br>
consist exclusively of the carbohydrate components A and B or may contain<br>
them. For the assessment of the proportion determining the carbohydrate<br>
components A and B in a dietary or pharmaceutical product, the following steps<br>
are carried out:<br>
In a first stage, all soluble carbohydrates are extracted from the product by<br>
means of water. Fats and proteins are removed from the extract<br>
In a second stage, the soluble carbohydrates, or the extract respectively, are<br>
digested by means of human enzymes, e.g. human amylase, human pancreatic<br>
juice or a small intestine ciliated border preparations. The thereby resulting non-<br>
digested carbohydrates (except for the in-vivo-resorbable monosaccharides<br>
obtained in this in-vitro experiment), constitute the two carbohydrate components<br>
A and B, and 80 % thereof are supposed to be prebioticaliy active.<br>
A prebiotically active carbohydrate according to the present invention is<br>
understood as a carbohydrate, which reaches the large intestine undigested (and<br>
hence is not resorbable in the small intestine), and there, it selectively<br>
encourages the growth and/or the activity of one or of a restricted number of<br>
bacterial species in the intestine, and consequently promotes health. This<br>
prebiotic effect of such carbohydrates and their specific mechanisms are<br>
described in detail in "G.R. Gibson &amp; M.B. Roberfroid, J. Nutr. 1995; 125: 1401 -<br>
1412", whereto explicit reference is herewith made, and the disclosure of which is<br>
included in the present documents.<br>
The inventive carbohydrate mixtures hence are those, wherein the<br>
carbohydrates, which are soluble and undigested in the sense described above,<br>
fulfil the herein specified criteria and constitute the carbohydrate components A<br>
and B.<br>
Apart from these carbohydrate components A and B, other carbohydrates may<br>
be present as well. Amongst those are 1.) the actually soluble but digestible<br>
carbohydrates, which are digestible according to the above-described second<br>
stage, and 2.) the insoluble carbohydrates, which are resorbable./.digestible or<br>
even not resorbable./.digestible.<br>
These carbohydrates enumerated sub 1.) and 2.), may be present as such in any<br>
arbitrary quantities in addition to the carbohydrate components A and B, in each<br>
case depending on the desired final product. Preferably, the insoluble<br>
carbohydrates constitute 0 to 10 wt-% of the carbohydrate mixtures.<br>
Carbohydrate component A may, for example, consist of one or more of the<br>
following carbohydrates: ß-galactooligosaccharides, a-galaetooligesaeeharides,<br>
fructo-oligosaccharides, fuco-oligosaccharides, manno-oligosaccharides, xylo-<br>
oligosaccharides, sialyl-oligosaccharides, N-glycoprotein oligosaccharides, O-<br>
glycoprotein oligosaccharides, glycolipid oligosaccharides, cello-<br>
oligosaccharides, chitosan-oligosaccharides, chitin-oligosaccharides,<br>
galacturono-oligosaccharides, glucurono-oligosaccharides, ß-glucan<br>
oligosaccharides, arabinoxylo-oligosaccharides, arabinogalacto-<br>
oligosaccharides, xylogluco-oligosaccharides, galactomanno-oligosaccharides,<br>
rhamno-oligosaccharides.<br>
Carbohydrate component B may, for example, be formed of one or more of the<br>
following carbohydrates or saccharides:<br>
Soluble carbohydrates or saccharides: fruct(os)anes/inulins, galactans,<br>
fucoidans, arabinans, xylans, xanthans, ß-glucans, galacturonans, N-glycans, O-<br>
glycans, hyaluronic acids, chondroitins, xyloglucans, arabinogalactans, alginates,<br>
carageenanes, galactomannans, arabinoxylanes, glycolipid glycans, glycoprotein<br>
glycans, proteoglycans.<br>
By means of a selective combination of oligosaccharides and polysaccharides,<br>
and consequently the simultaneous presence of carbohydrate components A and<br>
B, the health-promoting microorganisms in the large intestine may be promoted<br>
by an essentially higher efficiency than it would be the case with only one of said<br>
carbohydrate components. Thus, it is possible with the administration of the<br>
inventive combination, to make very rapid restitution of a normal large intestinal<br>
flora, to maintain same or to prophylactically prevent an alteration of the intestinal<br>
flora during situations of stress, and thus to influence the bacterial colonization of<br>
the large intestine in a way, which is more efficient than the one with the<br>
previously used carbohydrates.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, at least 80 wt-% of carbohydrate<br>
component A as well as of carbohydrate component B consist of carbohydrates,<br>
which are bifidogenous and./.or which promote lactic acid bacteria. Due to such a<br>
combination of oligosaccharides and polysaccharides having said properties, the<br>
growth of the lactic acid bacteria may surprisingly be promoted in an essentially<br>
stronger manner than this would be the case with oligosaccharides or<br>
polysaccharides alone. Not only lactic acid bacteria are thereby promoted, which<br>
are naturally present in the intestine, but also the growth of those is promoted -<br>
optionally even in a selective manner - which are introduced exogenously.<br>
Apart from this indirect action via the bacteria themselves and their metabolites<br>
such as fatty acids (butyrate, propionate, etc.), pH effects and stimulation of<br>
colonozytes, direct physical effects such as peristalsis, water content, quantity of<br>
faeces, mechanical action upon the intestinal mucosa are likewise positively<br>
influenced.<br>
Thus, the inventive carbohydrate mixtures dispose not only of a nutritive effect<br>
but also of a wide spectrum of activities. In addition to the above-described<br>
biological effects, the following may also be achieved by means of the inventive<br>
mixtures: stabilization of a natural microflora, prevention of pathogenous<br>
substances./.organisms such as toxins, viruses, bacteria, fungi, transformed cells<br>
and parasites from adhering, dissolution of complexes of toxins, viruses, bacteria,<br>
fungi and other pathogens having endogenous cells, as well as their elimination<br>
from the body, and an acceleration of wound healing.<br>
Thus, the inventive mixtures are suitable for the prophylaxis and/or the treatment<br>
of symptoms./.diseases occurring in conjunction with a disturbed intestinal flora,<br>
for example, as a consequence of the association./.adhesion of the mentioned<br>
substances and organisms with/on epithelia or other endogenous cells.<br>
The carbohydrates or saccharides of carbohydrate components A and B primarily<br>
differ in size. Nevertheless, mixtures have found to be particularly efficient,<br>
wherein the carbohydrates or the saccharides of carbohydrate component A, on<br>
the one hand, and of carbohydrate component B, on the other hand, are of a<br>
different structure. This different structure may, for example, concern the<br>
monosaccharide composition when, for example, fructans are used on the one<br>
hand, and galactans, on the other hand. This different structure may likewise<br>
concern the glycosidic bonding (e.g. a-galacto oligosaccharides versus ß-<br>
galacto oligosaccharides or a-glucans (starch) versus ß-glucans (cellulose)).<br>
The monomer composition, as well as the glycoside bonding may have an<br>
influence on the chemical behaviour (e.g. solubility) or on the physiological<br>
behaviour (e.g. digestibility).<br>
The core of the inventive mixtures may inter alia be seen in that carbohydrates of<br>
different sizes are used, which preferably and additionally belong to at least two<br>
different "classes". With an administration of such mixtures, a synergetic effect<br>
may occur relative to the prebiotic effects of the separate substance groups A<br>
and B.<br>
Thus, the carbohydrates of component A may not belong to one substance class<br>
alone but may also be formed out of several classes (for example A: galacto-<br>
oligosaccharides plus fuco-oligosaccharides), whereas the carbohydrates of<br>
component B may equally originate from one substance class and also from<br>
several substance classes (for example B: inulins plus xylans).<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment, the carbohydrate component A<br>
constitutes 95 to 60 wt-%, and in particular about 90 wt-%, and the carbohydrate<br>
component B 5 to 40 wt-%, and in particular about 10 wt-% of the carbohydrates<br>
present in toto.<br>
Particularly efficient mixtures are those wherein at least 60 wt-%, and in particular<br>
80 to 100 wt-% of the carbohydrates of carbohydrate component A belong to the<br>
group of the galacto-oligosaccharides, and at least 60 wt-%, and in particular 80<br>
to 100 wt-% of the carbohydrates of carbohydrate component B belong to the<br>
group of the fructo-polysaccharides. Galacto-oligosaccharides are composed of<br>
galactose residues of different glycosidic bonds, in particular at the ß 1-4 and ß 1-<br>
6 position. At the reducing end, at p 1-4 of a glycosidic bond, glucose can be<br>
present. Fructo-polysaecharides, fruetans, inuiins and levans being part thereof,<br>
are composed of fructose residues of giycosidic bonds at the p 2-1 and p -6<br>
position. At the reducing end, at p 2-1 of a glycosidic bond, glucose can be<br>
present.<br>
When a range is mentioned within the scope of the present invention, said range<br>
indication wilt encompass and disclose at least all integral intermediate values,<br>
and even all narrower ranges embraced by the wider range. This means that for<br>
carbohydate component A as well as for carbohydrate component B, which may<br>
both constitute 5 to 95 wt-%, that all intermediate values such as 6, 7, 8, 9... 13,<br>
14... 25, 26, 27... 30, 31, 32, 33... 38, 39, 40, 41... 47, 48, 49, 50, 51... 59, 60, 61,<br>
62, 63... 72, 73, 74... 79, 80, 81, 82... 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93 and 94 wt-% are<br>
likewise covered. The same applies to the indication that at least 80 wt-% of the<br>
carbohydrates of carbohydrate component A and at least 80 wt-% of the<br>
carbohydrates of carbohydrate component B are prebiotically active or promote<br>
lactic acid bacteria and / or are bifidogenic. Thus, the term "at least 80 wt-%"<br>
designates at least all single values between 80 wt-% and 100 wt-%, and hence,<br>
for example, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98,<br>
99 and 100 wt-%. The carbohydrate components A and B may therewith<br>
exclusively consist of such carbohydrates.<br>
The mixing ratio between carbohydrate component A and carbohydrate<br>
component B hence is 5 to 95 wt-%, or 95 to 5 wt-% respectively, and in<br>
particular 95 to 60, or 5 to 40 wt-% respectively. Thus, at least all integral<br>
narrower ranges are disclosed as well. The weight ratio between carbohydrate<br>
component A and carbohydrate component B may therefore, for example, be<br>
50:50, 51:49, 52:48, 53:47, 54:46, 55:45, 56:44, 57:43, 58:42, 49:41, 60:40,<br>
61:39, 62:38, 63:37, 64:36, 65:35, 66:34, 67:33, 68:32, 69:31, 70:30, 71:29,<br>
72:28, 73:27, 74:26, 75:25, 76:24, 77:23, 78:22, 79:21, 80:20, 81:19, 82:18,<br>
83:17, 84:16, 85:15, 86:14, 87:13, 88:12, 89:11, 90:10, 91:9, 92:8, 93:7, 94:6,<br>
and 95:5.<br>
The molecular weight of the polysaccharides may thereby be of some MDas, and<br>
may be extended to particular carbohydrates. Preferably, however,<br>
polysaccharide molecules are used comprising up to 100 monosaccharide units.<br>
For the production of the inventive carbohydrate mixtures, carbohydrates and<br>
carbohydrate mixtures known to date und used in particular for the production of<br>
foods or food products can be used. It is also possible to use raw materials<br>
previously modified in a technical way. The preparation of the inventive mixtures<br>
may thereby ensue by means of a simple blending of the correspondingly<br>
selected carbohydrates or oligosaccharides with polysaccharides or the<br>
carbohydrate mixtures. The initial components must thereby be so mixed with<br>
one another that the inventive parameters are respected with the finished<br>
inventive mixtures.<br>
As raw materials may be used reserve carbohydrates (fructans, galacto-<br>
oligosaccharides from legumes, fucoidan, a-glucane, laminarin, canragenan,<br>
mannans, galactomannans, agar), natural gum, N-glycosidic bonded<br>
carbohydrates of glycoproteins, O-glycosidic bonded carbohydrates of<br>
glycoproteins, glycans of glycolipids, enzymaticly prepared carbohydrates<br>
(galacto-oligosaccharides, gluco-oligosaccharides, xyio-oligosaccharides),<br>
bacterial carbohydrates (such as xanthans), as well as oligosaccharides (galacto-<br>
oligosaccharides, gluco-oligosaccharides (from a 1-2 and a 1-3 glucose<br>
residues), xylo-oligosaccharides), as well as skeletal carbohydrates such as<br>
celluloses, hemicelluloses (arabinans, galactans), pectins and chitins may be<br>
used. The substances should preferably be of food-grade (cf. Complex<br>
Carbohydrates in Foods, British Nutrition Foundation; Chapman &amp; Hall, London<br>
1990). It is also possible to carrying out an enzymatic modification of the raw<br>
materials by means of hydrolases (e.g. glycosidases, transglycosidases and<br>
lipases), transferases, isomerases (e.g. aldolases and ketolases),<br>
oxidoreductases (e.g. oxidases) and reductases (e.g. glucosedehydrogenases),<br>
lyases (e.g. polysaccharide lyases) and ligases of the raw materials and<br>
products. Moreover, it is possible to carry out a technical modification of the raw<br>
materials and products, namely by means of pressure (e.g. extrusion),<br>
temperature (e.g. caramelization), organic syntheses, organic modification (e.g.<br>
carboxymethylation and peracetylation), acid and/or alkaline hydrolysis and<br>
fractionation (e.g. depending on size and/or physico-chemical parameters such<br>
as charge and hydrophobicity).<br>
The inventive carbohydrate mixtures thereby are essentially composed of the<br>
hereinafter listed monosaccharides and of the thereof composed<br>
oligosaccharides and polysaccharides. D-glucose, D-fructose, D-galactose, D-<br>
mannose, L-fucose, D-N-acetylglucosamine, D-N-acetylgalactosamine, D-xylose,<br>
L-rhamnose, D-arabinose, D-allose, D-talose, L-idose, D-ribose, as well as<br>
monosaccharides comprising carboxyl groups such as D-galacturon acid, D-<br>
glucuron acid, D-mannuron acid and/or the methylated forms thereof such as N-<br>
acetylneuramin acid, N-glycolylneuramin acid and/or the Oacetyiated forms<br>
thereof.<br>
Moreover, these monomers and the thereupon based higher units can be<br>
modified by means of -OSO3H groups and / or -OPO3H groups.<br>
The subject matter of the present invention is also dietetic or pharmaceutical<br>
compositions containing said inventive carbohydrate mixtures, and the use of<br>
said above-described carbohydrate mixtures for promoting the flora of the large<br>
intestine in humans. The term "promoting / promotion" represents a general term<br>
for all of the above-listed biological actions. Thereto belongs in particular the<br>
promotion of the growth of lactic acid-producing bacteria.<br>
The inventive mixtures may be present in the following products:<br>
Formulas for prematurely born babies, formulas for maturely born babies, infant<br>
formulas, human milk fortifier, clinical nutrition (in general, the inventive mixture<br>
may replace a part or the entirety of other components in these nutritions, such<br>
as, for example, lactose, maltodextrin or starch, or may be added to the nutrition),<br>
pharmaceuticals, dietetic supplement (as sachet in drinks).<br>
In the following, carbohydrate mixtures representing various preferred<br>
embodiments are described. The indications thereby refer to weight percent, if<br>
not indicated otherwise. In these examples it is stated to which carbohydrate<br>
components A or B the used carbohydrates belong. The carbohydrate<br>
component A is thereby only called "A", and carbohydrate component B only "B".<br>
Example 1<br>
Composition<br>
90 % A = galacto-oligosaccharides<br>
transgalacto-oligosaccharides, e.g. Elixor® (Company Borculo, enzymatic from<br>
lactose by means of ß-galactosidase)<br>
10 % B = inulin<br>
Inulin, e.g. Raftiline® HP (Company Orafti, extraction from chicories, physical<br>
separation of the low-molecular oligosaccharides)<br>

treated with ß-gaiactosidase. The lactose is thereby cataiyticafiy transformed in<br>
galacto-oligosaccharides, whereby a piuraiity of gaiacto-oligosaccharides are<br>
formed having varying chain lenghts. Primarily, disaccharides and trisaccharides<br>
comprising 3 or 2 galactose units are thereby obtained.<br>
