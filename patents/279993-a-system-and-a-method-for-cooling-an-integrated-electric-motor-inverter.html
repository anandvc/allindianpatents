				<td>COOLING SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR INTEGRATED ELECTRIC<br>
MOTOR-INVERTERS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] The inventive subject matter generally relates to an integrated<br>
electric motor-inverter, and more particularly relates to cooling systems and<br>
methods for integrated electric motor-inverters.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIVE SUBJECT MATTER<br>
[0002] Vehicles that utilize electric traction motors to drive wheels of a<br>
vehicle typically use a three-phase alternating current ("AC") motor coupled<br>
with an inverter having circuitry that converts direct current ("DC") from a<br>
power source to alternating current:. The inverter circuitry generally includes<br>
insulated gate bipolar transistors (' IGBTs") and diodes mounted on a direct<br>
bonded copper ("DBC") substrate. The DBC has integrated bus bars that<br>
operate with a circuit card and signal connector to provide a power electronics<br>
package.<br>
[0003] During operation, the inverter converts DC current to AC current<br>
with an associated efficiency. Some energy produced by the inverter may be<br>
removed as heat to ensure that components thereof remain within allowable<br>
operating temperature limits. Currently, this is accomplished by circulating<br>
fluids through heat sinks associated with the DBC or by flowing air over the<br>
power electronics package to absorb and carry away heat. Although these<br>
configurations generally operate sufficiently, they may be improved. For<br>
example, conventional systems that cool by circulating fluids or flowing air<br>
typically operate in conjunction with other separately packaged motor cooling<br>
systems. However, as the demand for smaller vehicles has increased,<br>
optimization of space utilization has increased as well, and the current<br>
packaging of the inverters, motors, and cooling systems may be too large for<br>
these smaller vehicles.<br>
 <br>
[0004] Accordingly, it is desirable to have an electric traction motor and<br>
inverter package that is smaller than a conventional motor and inverter<br>
package. In addition, it is desirable to suitably cool the inverter such that<br>
component temperatures may be controlled. Furthermore, other desirable<br>
features and characteristics of the inventive subject matter will become<br>
apparent from the subsequent detailed description and the appended claims,<br>
taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and the foregoing<br>
technical field and background.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIVE SUBJECT MATTER<br>
[0005] In accordance with an embodiment, by way of example only, a<br>
cooling system is provided for an integrated electric motor-inverter, where the<br>
integrated electric motor-inverter includes a housing, a motor, and an inverter,<br>
the motor and the inverter are within the housing, and the motor includes a<br>
stator. The system includes a cooling jacket, a first coolant, a condenser, a<br>
spray head, and a second coolant. The cooling jacket is disposed concentric to<br>
the stator and includes an inner wall and an outer wall. The inner wall is in<br>
direct contact with the stator. The first coolant is disposed between the<br>
cooling jacket inner and outer walls. The condenser is disposed concentric to<br>
the cooling jacket. The spray head is disposed adjacent the inverter within the<br>
housing. The second coolant is in flow communication with the spray head.<br>
During system operation, (i) the second coolant is directed onto the inverter by<br>
the spray head, (ii) at least a portion of the second coolant enters the condenser<br>
in a gas phase, and (iii) the second coolant contacts the cooling jacket outer<br>
wall and heat from the second coolant is transferred through the cooling jacket<br>
to the first coolant causing the second coolant to phase change into a liquid.<br>
[0006] In another embodiment, by way of example only, a cooling system<br>
is provided. The cooling system includes a heat exchanger, a first coolant, an<br>
integrated electric motor-inverter, a cooling jacket, a condenser, a spray head,<br>
and a second coolant. The first coolant is in fluid communication with the<br>
heat exchanger. The integrated electric motor-inverter is in thermal<br>
 <br>
<br>
communication with the first coolant and includes a housing, a motor, and an<br>
inverter. The motor and the inverter are disposed within the housing, and the<br>
motor includes a stator. The cooling jacket Is disposed concentric to the stator<br>
and includes an inner wall and an outer wall and the first coolant disposed<br>
therebetween. The inner wall is in direct contact with the stator. The<br>
condenser is disposed concentric to the cooling jacket. The spray head is<br>
disposed adjacent the inverter within the housing. The second coolant is in<br>
flow communication with the spray head. During system operation, (i) the<br>
second coolant is directed onto the inverter by the spray head, (ii) at least a<br>
portion of the second coolant enters the condenser in a gas phase, and (iii) the<br>
second coolant contacts the cooling jacket outer wall and heat from the second<br>
coolant is transferred through the cooling jacket to the first coolant causing the<br>
second coolant to phase change into a liquid.<br>
[0007] In still another embodiment, by way of example only, a method is<br>
provided for cooling an integrated electric motor-inverter, the integrated<br>
electric motor-inverter including a housing, a motor, and an inverter, the motor<br>
and the inverter disposed within the housing, and the motor including a stator.<br>
The method includes the steps of flowing a first coolant through a cooling<br>
jacket defined, in part, by an inner wall and an outer wall, the inner and outer<br>
walls disposed concentric to the staror, and the inner wall in direct contact<br>
with the stator such that heat is absorbed from the stator through the cooling<br>
jacket inner wall into the first coolant, and directing a second coolant onto the<br>
inverter, wherein the second coolant migrates into a condenser in a gas phase,<br>
the condenser disposed concentric to the cooling jacket and defined, in part by<br>
an outer surface of the cooling jacket outer wall and the gas phase second<br>
coolant contacts the cooling jacket outer wall outer surface to transfer heat<br>
from the second coolant to thereto and phase change the gas phase second<br>
coolant into a liquid second coolant<br>

vehicle, according to an embodiment;<br>
[0010] FIG. 2 is a schematic of a heat exchanger and motor-inverter<br>

[0012] FIG. 4 is a cross-sectional view of the integrated electric motor-<br>

DESCRIPTION OF AN EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT<br>
[0013] The following detailed description is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and is not intended to limit the inventive subject matter or the application and<br>
uses of the inventive subject matter. Furthermore, there is no intention to be<br>
bound by any expressed or implied theory presented in the preceding technical<br>
field, background, brief summary or the following detailed description.<br>
[0014] FIG. 1 is a schematic of a gas-electric drive 100 implemented into<br>
a vehicle 102. In an embodiment, me gas-electric drive 100 may include an<br>
internal combustion engine 104 and an electric traction motor 106. The<br>
internal combustion engine 104 generates pov/er and is in operative<br>
communication with a power splitter device 108 that divides the generated<br>
power between a transmission 110 and an electric generator 112. As shown in<br>
FIG. 1, the transmission 110 may be configured to drive wheels 114 of the<br>
vehicle 102. The electric generator 112 generates more power that may be<br>
used to charge a battery 116. The battery 116 may supply current to an<br>
inverter 118, which in turn, supplies power to the electric traction motor 106.<br>
In an embodiment, the inverter 118 and the electric traction motor 106 may be<br>
an integral component and thus, may be a single module (e.g., integrated<br>
 <br>
<br>
electric motor-inverter 119). Alternatively, the electric traction motor 106<br>
may receive power directly from the electric: generator 112.<br>
[0015] After a period of operation, the internal combustion engine 104 or<br>
the electric traction motor 106 may increase in temperature. To maintain the<br>
temperatures within an acceptable range (e.g., ± 10 degrees), a heat exchanger<br>
120 and a motor-inverter cooling system 122 may be included. The heat<br>
exchanger 120 may be thermally coupled to the motor-inverter cooling system<br>
122.<br>
[0016] With reference to FIG. 2, a schematic of the heat exchanger 120<br>
and motor-inverter cooling system 122 are shown. The heat exchanger 120<br>
may thermally communicate with and cool the internal combustion engine 104<br>
by circulating a first coolant 124 therebetween. In an embodiment, the first<br>
coolant 124 may be water ethylene glycol. The motor-inverter cooling system<br>
122 is configured to circulate a second coolant 126 therethrough, which<br>
thermally communicates with the f rst coolant 124 within the condenser-<br>
cooling jacket assembly 134. In an embodiment, the second coolant 126 may<br>
be a composition that does not electrically interact with or degrade the<br>
components of the inverter 118, such as a dielectric liquid coolant. In an<br>
embodiment, the dielectric liquid coolant may include mixtures of<br>
methylsiloxane and an organic compound such as polypropylene glycol<br>
methyl ether. In another embodiment, the dielectric liquid coolant may<br>
include mixtures of hexmethyldisiloxane and propylene glycol methyl ether,<br>
where the hexmethyidisiloxane has a percentage by weight greater than about<br>
60%, and the propyleneglycol methyl ether has a percentage by weight in a<br>
range of about 10% to about 30%. As used herein, the term "about" means<br>
within 0.5%. Other compositions, which have minimal instability and<br>
reactivity with the electrical components of the inverter 118, may be used as<br>
alternatives.<br>
[0017] The motor-inverter cooling system 122 may include a reservoir 128<br>
containing a portion of the second coolant 126 that may be pumped by a sump<br>
pump assembly 130. The sump pump assembly 130 may be in flow<br>
 <br>
<br>
communication with one or more spray heads 132 that may be disposed over a<br>
portion of the inverter 118. The spray heads 132 spray the second coolant 126<br>
on and cool the inverter 118. After being sprayed, a portion of the second<br>
coolant 126 may be in a gaseous phase and may migrate into a condenser-<br>
cooling jacket assembly 134 via a vapor return path 137 while the remainder,<br>
being in a liquid state, may migrate to a reservoir 128 via an overspray return<br>
path 135. The condenser-cooling, acket assembly 134 is thermally coupled to<br>
the first coolant 124 so that when the gas-phase second coolant 126 enters the<br>
condenser-cooling jacket assembly 134, heat in the second coolant 126 may be<br>
transferred to the first coolant 124 to thereby cause the gas-phase second<br>
coolant 126 to phase change back into a liquid. The liquid-phase second<br>
coolant 126 may then be recirculated through the motor-inverter cooling<br>
system 122 (e.g., into reservoir 128).<br>
[0018] Turning now to FIGs. 3 and 4, the motor-inverter cooling system<br>
122 is shown implemented within an integrated electric motor-inverter 300,<br>
according to an embodiment. In particular, FIG. 3 is a side cross-sectional<br>
view of the electric motor-inverter 300, and FIG. 4 is a cross-sectional view of<br>
the electric motor-inverter 300 shown in FIG. 3 taken along line 4-4. The<br>
electric motor-inverter 300 generally includes the inverter 118 and the electric<br>
traction motor 106 disposed within a housing 136. The inverter 118 is<br>
disposed adjacent to the electric traction motor 106 on one side. In an<br>
embodiment, one or more spray heads 132 may be disposed adjacent the<br>
inverter 118 on the other side, the condenser-cooling jacket assembly 134 may<br>
be disposed concentric to the electric traction motor 106, and the sump pump<br>
assembly 130 may be positioned to communicate between the condenser-<br>
cooling jacket assembly 134 and the spray heads 132. These components will<br>
now be discussed in more detail.<br>
[0019] In an embodiment, the inverter 118 includes power electronics that<br>
may be made up of one or more insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) 138<br>
bonded with a direct bonded copper (DBC) substrate 140. The DBC substrate<br>
140 may be integrated with an AC/DC bus (not shown) to form an inverter<br>
 <br>
<br>
circuit. The spray heads 132 are disposed such that spray nozzles 142 thereof<br>
may be in sufficient proximity to the IGBTs 138 and DBC substrate 140 to<br>
dispense second coolant 126 directly thereon.<br>
[0020] The second coolant 126 may be dispensed in stream form or<br>
flooded over the inverter 118. In another embodiment, the second coolant 126<br>
may be sprayed as a mist or in discrete droplets onto the inverter 118. Liquid<br>
from overspray may return to the reservoir 128 via an overspray return path<br>
135.<br>
[0021] As mentioned above, when the second coolant 126 is in a gaseous<br>
phase, it may migrate to and collect on the condenser-cooling jacket assembly<br>
134. The condenser-cooling jacket assembly 134 includes a cooling jacket<br>
144 and a condenser 146 that are mounted to the electric traction motor 106.<br>
The cooling jacket 144 may be disposed concentric to a stator 148, a rotor 149,<br>
and a shaft 150 of the electric traction motor 106 and may extend at least<br>
partially along the length of the stator 148. In an embodiment, as shown in<br>
FIG. 3, the cooling jacket 144 may extend along an entire length of the stator<br>
148.<br>
[0022] The cooling jacket 144 is configured to receive the first coolant<br>
124 from the heat exchanger 120 (FIG. 2), and in this regard, includes an inner<br>
wall 152 and an outer wall 154 forming a space therebetween through which<br>
the first coolant 124 may flow. The inner wall 152 may be in thermal (e.g.,<br>
direct) contact with the stator 148 so that heat therefrom may transfer to the<br>
first coolant 124. In an embodiment, pin fins 156 may extend from the inner<br>
wall 152 towards the outer wall 154 or from the outer wall 154 towards the<br>
inner wall 152 to enhance heat transfer from the stator 148 to the first coolant<br>
124.<br>
[0023] The condenser 146 may be disposed concentric to the cooling<br>
jacket 144 and may extend at least partially along the length thereof. In an<br>
embodiment, as depicted in FIG. 3, the condenser 146 may extend an entire<br>
length of the cooling jacket 144. The condenser 146 may be defined, in part<br>
by the cooling jacket outer wall 154 and an inner surface 158 of the electric<br>
 <br>
motor-inverter housing 136. Thus, when the gaseous-phase second coolant<br>
126 contacts an outer surface 162 of the cooling jacket outer wall 154, it may<br>
condense and form condensed droplets 160. Specifically, heat from the<br>
gaseous-phase second coolant 126 may be transferred through the cooling<br>
jacket outer wall 154 to the first coolant 124 causing the second coolant 126 to<br>
phase change into a liquid 164. The droplets 160 and liquid 164 may return to<br>
the reservoir 128 via the vapor return path 137.<br>
[0024] As alluded to briefly above, the liquid second coolant 126 may<br>
collect in the reservoir 128. In an embodiment, the reservoir 128 may be in<br>
flow communication the sump pump assembly 130, which may be used to<br>
return the second coolant 126 to the spray heads 132. The sump pump<br>
assembly 130 may include a pump 166 that pumps the second coolant 126<br>
back to the spray heads 132 via a return line 168. The second coolant 126<br>
may then be directed onto the inverter 118 by spraying the second coolant 126<br>
through the spray nozzles 142 to once again cool the inverter 118.<br>
[0025] An integrated electric motor-inverter has now been described that<br>
may have a smaller package than conventional inverters and motors. In<br>
addition, the integrated electric motor-inverter may be cooled such that<br>
temperature fluctuations are controlled and component expansions and<br>
contractions may be maintained within an acceptable range.<br>
[0026] While at least one exemplary embodiment has been presented in<br>
the foregoing detailed description, it should be appreciated that a vast number<br>
of variations exist. It should also be appreciated that the exemplary<br>
embodiment or exemplary embodiments are only examples, and are not<br>

 <br>
17.	A method for cooling an integrated electric motor-inverter,<br>
the integrated electric motor-inverter including a housing, a motor, and an<br>
inverter, and the motor including a stator, the method comprising the steps of:<br>
flowing a first coolant through a cooling jacket defined, in part, by<br>
an inner wall and an outer wall, the inner and outer walls disposed concentric<br>
to the stator, and the inner wall in direct contact with the stator such that heat<br>
is absorbed from the stator through the cooling jacket inner wall into the first<br>
coolant; and<br>
directing a second coolant onto the inverter, wherein the second<br>
coolant migrates into a condenser in a gas phase, the condenser disposed<br>
concentric to the cooling jacket and defined, in part by an outer surface of the<br>
cooling jacket outer wall and the gas phase second coolant contacts the<br>
cooling jacket outer wall outer surface to transfer heat from the second coolant<br>
to thereto and phase change the gas phase second coolant into a liquid second<br>
coolant.<br>
18.	The method of claim 17, wherein the step of flowing a first<br>
coolant comprises flowing the first coolant between the cooling jacket and a<br>
heat exchanger.<br>
19.	The method of claim 17, wherein the step of flowing a first<br>
coolant comprises flowing the first coolant such that heat is transferred to the<br>
first coolant from at least one pin fir: extending from the inner wall towards<br>
the outer wall or from the outer wall towards the inner wall.<br>
20.	The method of claim 17, further comprising:<br>
pumping the liquid second coolant to a spray head; and<br>
 <br>
wherein the step of directing comprises spraying the liquid second<br>
coolant at the inverter, at least a portion of the liquid second coolant sprayed at<br>
the inverter in a gaseous phase.<br>
