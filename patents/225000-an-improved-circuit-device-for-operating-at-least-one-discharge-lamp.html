				<td>The invention relates to a circuit arrangement for operating at least one<br>
discharge lamp in accordance with the features of the invention.<br>
I.Prior art<br>
A circuit arrangement is disclosed, for example, in the Laid-Open Patent<br>
specification EP 0 753 987 Al. This circuit arrangement has a half-bridge inverter<br>
with a switch-off device which switches off the half-bridge inverter in the case of<br>
an anomalous operating state-for example in the case of a lamp which refuses to<br>
start or is defective. The switch-off device has a field effect transistor whose<br>
drain-source path is arranged in the control circuit of a half-bridge inverter<br>
transistor and switches the control circuit between a low-resistance and a high-<br>
resistance state. Upon the occurrence of an anomalous operating state, the<br>
switch off is performed synchronously with the blocking phase of that half-bridge<br>
inverter transistor in whose control circuit the field effect transistor is arranged.<br>
The switch-off device of this circuit arranged certainly switches the half-bridge<br>
inverter off reliably in the case of a lamp which refuses to start, but it reacts in<br>
general too insensitively to the occurrence of the so-called rectifying effect of the<br>
discharge lamp, which will be explained in more detail below.<br>
A possible cause of failure of discharge lamps, in particular of low-pressure<br>
discharge lamps, is<br>
occasioned by a reduction over the lifetime of the lamp<br>
in the ability of the lamp electrodes to emit. Since<br>
the loss of the ability to emit generally proceeds with<br>
varying intensity in the two lamp electrodes over the<br>
lifetime of the lamp, at the end of the lifetime of a<br>
discharge lamp operated with alternating current a<br>
preferred direction has been formed for the discharge<br>
current through the discharge lamp. The discharge lamp<br>
develops a current-rectifying effect in this case. This<br>
effect is designated as a rectifying effect of the<br>
discharge lamp. Owing to the occurrence of the<br>
rectifying effect in the discharge lamp, the lamp<br>
electrode incapable of emission is heated extremely,<br>
with the result that impermissibly high temperatures<br>
can occur which can even cause melting of the lamp bulb<br>
glass.<br>
Moreover, in the case of discharqe lamps which are<br>
operated on a half-bridge inverter, the rectifying<br>
effect of the discharge lamp causes a substantial<br>
deviation in the voltage drop across the coupling<br>
capacitor or the coupling capacitors from the normal<br>
value, which is usually half as large as the value of<br>
the input voltage of the half-bridge inverter. In the<br>
case of self-oscillating half-bridge inverters, this<br>
deviation in the voltage drop across the coupling<br>
capacitor or the coupling capacitors leads to stopping<br>
the oscillation of the half-bridge inverter, because<br>
the supply voltage of one of the two half-bridge<br>
branches is in this case too low to maintain the<br>
feedback. However, immediately after being interrupted<br>
the oscillation of the half-bridge inverter is set<br>
going again by the starting circuit of the half-bridge<br>
inverter if the switch-off device is not triggered. As<br>
a result, the discharge lamp affected by the rectifying<br>
effect is not reliably switched off, but flickers<br>
instead.<br>
II. Summary of the invention<br>
It is the object of the invention to provide a circuit arrangement for operating at<br>
least one discharge lamp with an improved switch-off device which does not<br>
have the disadvantages of the prior art. In particular, the aim is for the switch-<br>
off device to detect the occurrence of the rectifying effect of the at least one<br>
discharge lamp and to switch off the half-bridge inverter permanently in this<br>
case.<br>
This object is achieved according to the features of the invention.<br>
The circuit arrangement according to the invention, which has a half-bridge<br>
inverter with a downstream bad circuit, at least one coupling capacitor<br>
connected to the load circuit and the half-bridge inverter, as well as term rials for<br>
at least one discharge lamp and a switch-off device for switching off the half-<br>
bridge inverter upon the occurrence of an anomalous operating state, has<br>
according to the invention, means for monitoring the voltage drop across the at<br>
least one coupling capacitor and for activating the switch-off device as a function<br>
of the voltage drop detected across the at least one coupling capacitor.<br>
As already explained further above, the occurrence of the rectifying effect of the<br>
at least one discharge lamp causes a substantial deviation in the voltage drop<br>
across the at least one coupling capacitor from its normal valve, which is half as<br>
large as the input voltage of the half-bridge inverter. With the aid of the above<br>
named means according to the invention, the occurrence of the rectifying effect<br>
of the at least one discharge lamp is detected by using these means to monitor<br>
the voltage drop across the at least one.<br>
coupling capacitor, and activating the switch-off<br>
device when the voltage drop across the at least one<br>
coupling capacitor deviates substantially from its<br>
normal value.<br>
The above named means according to the invention<br>
advantageously have a first device for activating the<br>
switch-off device upon a predetermined upper limiting<br>
value of the voltage drop across the at least one<br>
coupling capacitor being reached, and a second device<br>
for activatinq the switch-off device upon a<br>
predetermined lower limiting value of the voltage drop<br>
across the at least one coupling capacitor being<br>
reached. The upper and the lower limiting value's must<br>
be preset so that a slight asymmetry in the case of the<br>
lamp electrodes does not already lead to activation of<br>
the switch-off device. For this reason, the upper<br>
limiting value is advantageously not less than<br>
7 5 percent of the input or supply voltage of the<br>
half-bridge inverter, and the lower limiting value is<br>
advantageously at most 25 percent of the input or<br>
supply voltage of the half-bridge inverter.<br>
The first and/or second device advantageously have at<br>
least one electric component with a nonlinear<br>
current-voltage characteristic which is connected to<br>
the at least one coupling capacitor and to the at least<br>
one control input of the switch-off device. With the<br>
aid of such an electric component with a nonlinear<br>
current-voltage characteristic, the upper or lower<br>
limiting value of the voltage drop across the at least<br>
one coupling capacitor for which the switch-off device<br>
is activated by the first or second device can be<br>
preset to the desired level. Components from the group<br>
of diode, Zener diode, suppressor diode and varistor<br>
are advantageously suitable as electric components with<br>
a non-linear current-voltage characteristic.<br>
Furthermore, the switch-off device of the circuit<br>
arrangement according to the invention advantageously<br>
has at least two control or regulating inputs,<br>
specifically one each for the first device and the<br>
second device. A control input is advantageously<br>
additionally connected in parallel in terms of<br>
alternating current with the at least one discharge<br>
lamp, in order to monitor the voltage drop across the<br>
terminals for the at least one discharge lamp. In order<br>
to ensure that the half-bridge inverter is switched off<br>
as reliably and permanently as possible during a<br>
malfunction or upon the occurrence of the rectifying<br>
effect of the at least one discharge lamp, the switch-<br>
off device of the circuit arrangement according to the<br>
invention advantageously has a bistable switching<br>
device. A thyristor equivalent circuit constructed from<br>
two transistors is particularly well suited as bistable<br>
switching device, since said circuit already has<br>
available two separate control inputs which can be used<br>
by the first and the second device to activate the<br>
switch-off device. The first device advantageously<br>
comprises an electric component with a nonlinear<br>
current-voltage characteristic, and a diode connected<br>
in series therewith, the anode of the diode being<br>
connected to a lamp terminal and to the at least one<br>
coupling capacitor, while the cathode of this diode is<br>
connected to the electric component with the nonlinear<br>
current-voltage characteristic, this electric component<br>
being connected to the first control input of the<br>
switch-off device. The second device advantageously<br>
comprises the series circuit of at least one diode with<br>
at least one resistor, this series circuit being<br>
connected, on the other hand, to the at least one<br>
coupling capacitor and a lamp terminal, and being<br>
connected, on the other hand, to the second control<br>
input of the switch-off device.<br>
III. Description of the preferred exemplary embodiments<br>
The invention is explained below in more detail with<br>
the aid of two preferred exemplary embodiments. A<br>
sketch of the circuit arrangement in accordance with<br>
the first preferred exemplary embodiment is illustrated<br>
in Figure 1. This circuit arrangement serves to operate<br>
a fluorescent lamp. It has a freely oscillating half-<br>
bridge inverter which is fitted with two bipolar<br>
transistors Ql, Q2 and draws its input or supply<br>
voltage via the DC voltage terminals j1, j2. The DC<br>
voltage terminal j2 is connected to frame potential,<br>
and a voltage of approximately + 400 V is provided at<br>
the DC voltage terminal jl. This input or supply<br>
voltage is generated from the rectified AC supply<br>
voltage with the aid of an upstream step-up converter,<br>
for example (not shown in the figure). Furthermore, a<br>
radio interference suppression filter known per se<br>
(likewise not illustrated) is connected upstream of the<br>
supply voltage rectifier.<br>
Two bipolar transistors Ql, Q2 of the half-bridge<br>
inverter are provided in each case with a freewheeling<br>
diode D1, D2 which are connected in parallel with the<br>
collector-emitter path of the corresponding transistor<br>
Ql, Q2. Moreover, the two bipolar transistors Ql, Q2<br>
respectively have an emitter resistor Rl, R2 and a<br>
base-emitter shunt resistor R3, R4. Furthermore, a<br>
capacitor Cl is arranged in parallel with the<br>
collector-emitter path of the transistor Ql. The two<br>
switching transistors Ql, Q2 of the half-bridge<br>
inverter are driven by means of an annular core<br>
transformer which has a primary winding Nl and two<br>
secondary windings N2, N3. The primary winding Nl is<br>
connected into the load circuit, designed as a series<br>
resonant circuit, of the half-bridge inverter. The load<br>
circuit is connected to the centre tap Ml between the<br>
bipolar transistors Ql, Q2 of the half-bridge inverter,<br>
and to the centre tap M2 between the two coupling<br>
capacitors C2, C3. The load circuit comprises the<br>
primary winding Nl, a resonance inductor L1, a<br>
resonance capacitor C4 and respectively two terminals<br>
for the two electrode filaments El, E2 of a fluorescent<br>
lamp LP. The resonance capacitor C4 is connected in<br>
parallel with the discharge path of the fluorescent<br>
lamp LP. The secondary windings N2, N3 are respectively<br>
arranged in the base-emitter junction of a bipolar<br>
transistor Ql, Q2, and connected to the base terminal<br>
of the relevant inverter transistor Ql, Q2 series, in<br>
each case via a base resistor R7, R8. The half-bridge<br>
inverter further has a starting device which<br>
essentially comprises the Diac DC, which is connected<br>
to the base terminal of the bipolar transistor Q2, and<br>
the starting capacitor C5, which is connected, on the<br>
one hand, to the terminal j2, which is at frame<br>
potential, and, on the other hand, via a resistor R9<br>
and a rectifying diode D3 to the centre tap Ml of the<br>
half-bridge inverter, as well as the resistor R20<br>
arranged in parallel with the starting capacitor C5.<br>
The starting circuit ensures the build-up of the<br>
half-bridge inverter after the circuit arrangement is<br>
switched on.<br>
The coupling capacitors C2, C3 each have a parallel<br>
resistor R5, R6. With the aid of the coupling<br>
capacitors C2, C3 and their parallel resistors R5, R6,<br>
a voltage drop which, in the ideal case, is half as<br>
large as the input or supply voltage of the half-bridge<br>
inverter provided at the terminals jl, j2, is generated<br>
at the centre tap M2 between the coupling capacitors<br>
C2, C3. In the ideal case, the voltage drop at the<br>
centre tap M2 and across the coupling capacitor C3 is<br>
therefore approximately + 2 00 V in the case of an input<br>
voltage of approximately + 400 V of the half-bridge<br>
inverter. In reality, the voltage drop at the centre<br>
tap M2 and across the coupling capacitor C3 deviates<br>
slightly from this ideal value.<br>
The circuit arrangement according to the invention also<br>
has a switch-off device which switches off the<br>
half-bridge inverter Ql, Q2 upon the occurrence of an<br>
anomalous operating state, that is to say in the case<br>
of a discharge lamp LP which refuses to start or is<br>
defective. The switch-off device essentially comprises<br>
a field effect transistor Tl whose drain-source path is<br>
connected in series with the emitter resistor R2 of the<br>
inverter transistor Q2, and a thyristor equivalent<br>
circuit A which is formed by the bipolar transistors<br>
Q3, Q4, as well as an error-signal monitoring unit<br>
which comprises the capacitors C8, C9, C10, the diodes<br>
D6, D7, D10, Dll and the resistors R10, R11, R17, R18.<br>
The thyristor equivalent circuit A has two control<br>
inputs. The first control input of the thyristor<br>
equivalent circuit is connected to the base terminal of<br>
the npn transistor Q4, while its second control input<br>
is connected to the base terminal of the pnp transistor<br>
Q3. The output of the thyristor equivalent circuit A at<br>
the collector terminal of the transistor Q4 is<br>
connected via a diode D9 to the gate of the field<br>
effect transistor Tl, the anode of the diode D9 being<br>
connected to the gate of the transistor Tl, and its<br>
cathode being connected to the collector of the<br>
transistor Q4. Furthermore, the gate terminal of the<br>
field effect transistor Tl is connected to the terminal<br>
j1 via the resistors R19, R6, R5 and via an electrode<br>
filament of the discharge lamp LP. Moreover, connected<br>
in parallel with the gate-source path of the field<br>
effect transistor Tl is a Zener diode D12 which serves<br>
as overvoltage protector for the transistor T1. The<br>
first control input of the thyristor equivalent circuit<br>
A is driven by means of the error-signal monitoring<br>
unit.<br>
With the aid of the RC integration element R17, C10,<br>
the rectifier diode D10 and the capacitor C9, the<br>
error-signal monitoring unit generates a smooth DC<br>
voltage which is present across the capacitor C10 and<br>
is proportional to the voltage drop across the<br>
discharge lamp LP. The abovementioned components are<br>
connected in parallel in terms of alternating current<br>
with the discharge path of the discharge lamp LP. The<br>
positive pole of the capacitor C10 is connected to a<br>
terminal of the electrode filament E2 of the discharge<br>
lamp LP via the components R10, C9, R17, and is<br>
connected to the first control input j3 of the<br>
thyristor equivalent circuit A via the components R10,<br>
R11, D6, D7. Moreover, by means of the CR series<br>
circuit C8, R10, which forms a differentiating element,<br>
the error-signal monitoring unit generates a<br>
synchronization signal which is obtained by<br>
differentiating the trapezoidal output voltage, present<br>
at the centre tap Ml, of the half-bridge inverter Ql,<br>
Q2. A square-wave voltage whose positive half wave is<br>
generated by the leading edge and whose negative half<br>
wave is generated by the trailing edge of the<br>
trapezoidal half-bridge inverter output voltage is<br>
therefore present at the resistor R10. The leading edge<br>
of the trapezoidal half-bridge inverter output voltage<br>
is produced by switching off the transistor Q2, while<br>
the trailing edge of the trapezoidal half-bridge<br>
inverter output voltage is produced by switching off<br>
the transistor Ql. Present at the centre tap ]5 of the<br>
differentiating element C8, R10 is a voltage which is<br>
composed additively of the voltage drop across the<br>
capacitor C10 and the voltage drop across the resistor<br>
R10. This voltage is fed to the first control input j3<br>
of the thyristor equivalent circuit via the Zener diode<br>
D7. The error-signal monitoring unit and its<br>
cooperation with the thyristor equivalent circuit A and<br>
the field effect transistor Tl are described in detail<br>
in the Laid-Open Specification EP 0 753 987.<br>
Furthermore, the circuit arrangement illustrated in the<br>
figure has a first device V1 and a second device V2 for<br>
activating the switch-off device, which are connected<br>
to the first and, respectively, to the second control<br>
input of the thyristor equivalent circuit A. The first<br>
device V1 comprises the series circuit of a Zener diode<br>
D4 with a diode D5, the anode of the diode D5 being<br>
connected to the centre tap M2 between the coupling<br>
capacitors C2, C3 and to a terminal of the electrode<br>
filament El of the discharge lamp LP, and the cathode<br>
of the diode D5 being connected to the cathode of the<br>
Zener diode D4 . The anode of the Zener diode D4 is<br>
connected to the first control input at the base<br>
terminal of the transistor Q4 of the thyristor<br>
equivalent circuit A via the resistors R10, R11, the<br>
diode D6, which is polarized in the same sense as the<br>
diode D5, and via a further Zener diode D7, which is<br>
polarized in the same sense as the Zener diode D4. The<br>
second device V2 comprises the series circuit of a<br>
diode D8 with a resistor R12. The cathode of the diode<br>
D8 is connected to the centre tap M2 and to the same<br>
terminal of the electrode filament El of the discharge<br>
lamp LP as the anode of the diode D5. The anode of the<br>
diode D8 is connected to the resistor R12, which is<br>
connected, for its part, to the second control input at<br>
the base terminal of the transistor Q3 of the thyristor<br>
equivalent circuit A. In addition to the transistors<br>
Q3, Q4, as further components the thyristor equivalent<br>
circuit A includes the capacitors C6, C7 and the<br>
resistors R13, R14, R15, R16. The mode of operation of<br>
a thyristor equivalent circuit constructed from two<br>
transistors is. described, for example, on pages 395 to<br>
3 96 in the book entitled "Bauelemente der Elektronik<br>
und ihre Grundschaltungen" ["Electronic Components and<br>
their Basic Circuits"] by H. Hoger, F. Kahler, G. Weigt<br>
from the series entitled «Einfuhrung in die Elektronik"<br>
["introduction to Electronics"], Vol. 1, published by<br>
H. Stam GmbH, 7th Edition.<br>
The mode of operation of the above described circuit<br>
arrangement is explained in more detail below for the<br>
case of normal operation, that is to say given an<br>
acceptably operating discharge lamp, and for the case<br>
of the anomalous operating state, that is to say a'<br>
discharge lamp which refuses to start, or in the case<br>
of the occurrence of the rectifying effect of the<br>
discharge lamp. A suitable dimensioning of the<br>
components used is specified in the table.<br>
Normal operation<br>
In the case of normal operation, after the discharge<br>
lamp or the circuit arrangement has been switched on<br>
the DC voltage supply for the half-bridge inverter Q1,<br>
Q2 builds up at the terminals jl, j2. The drain-source<br>
path of the field effect transistor T1, whose gate is<br>
connected via the resistors R19, R6, the electrode<br>
filament El and the resistor R5 to the terminal jl,<br>
which is at approximately + 400 V, is put into the<br>
low-resistance state. Furthermore, the starting<br>
capacitor C5 is charged via the resistor R5, the<br>
electrode filament El and the resistor R6 to the<br>
breakdown voltage of the Diac DC, which then generates<br>
trigger pulses for the base of the bipolar transistor<br>
Q2 and thereby causes the half-bridge inverter Q1, Q2<br>
to build up. After the transistor Q2 has been turned<br>
on, the starting capacitor C5 is discharged via the<br>
resistor R9 and the diode D3 to such an extent that the<br>
Diac DC generates no further trigger pulses. Present at<br>
the two coupling capacitors C2, C3 in each case is half<br>
the input voltage of the half-bridge inverter Ql, Q2,<br>
with the result that the centre tap M2 between the<br>
coupling capacitors C2, C3 is located at an electric<br>
potential of approximately + 2 00 V. The two half-bridge<br>
inverter transistors Ql, Q2 switch in an alternating<br>
fashion, so that the centre tap Ml between the<br>
transistors Ql, Q2 is connected alternately to the<br>
positive pole jl (+ 400 V) and the negative pole j2<br>
(frame potential) of the DC voltage supply of the<br>
half-bridge inverter. As a result, a medium-frequency<br>
alternating current whose frequency corresponds to the<br>
switching frequency of the half-bridge inverter flows<br>
in the load circuit between the centre taps Ml and M2.<br>
During the switching pauses, in which both transistors<br>
Ql, Q2 block, the load circuit current is maintained by<br>
means of the resonant inductor L1 and flows via one of<br>
the two freewheeling diodes D1, D2. Usually, the<br>
electrode filaments El, E2 of the fluorescent lamp LP<br>
have a heating current applied to them by means of a<br>
heating device (not illustrated) before the lamp is<br>
started, and are preheated in this way. In order to<br>
start the gas discharge in the discharge lamp LP, the<br>
starting voltage required for the purpose is provided<br>
at the resonance capacitor C4 by means of the method of<br>
resonant increase. That is to say, the switching<br>
frequency of the half-bridge inverter is approximated<br>
to the resonant frequency of the series resonance<br>
circuit L1, C4. After the lamp has been started, the<br>
resonance circuit L1, C4 is damped by the then<br>
conductive discharge path of the discharge lamp LP. The<br>
transistors Q3, Q4 of the thyristor equivalent circuit<br>
A are in the blocked state during normal operation, and<br>
the switch-off device is deactivated.<br>
Switching off the half-bridge inverter in the case of a<br>
discharge lamp which refuses to start<br>
(Anomalous operating state)<br>
Lacking the discharge lamp LP, the half-bridge inverter<br>
Q1, Q2 cannot build up, since the connection of the<br>
starting capacitor C5 to the voltage supply terminal j1<br>
is led via the terminals for the electrode filament El.<br>
A discharge lamp LP which refuses to start, or a<br>
defective discharge lamp LP which has, for example, an<br>
operating voltage which has increased due to ageing,<br>
causes an increased voltage drop across the capacitor<br>
C10. The positive voltage peaks of the synchronization<br>
signal generated by the differentiating element C8, R10<br>
are added at the tap j5 to the voltage of the capacitor<br>
C10. As a result, the threshold voltage of the Zener<br>
diode D7 is exceeded and the transistors Q3, Q4 of the<br>
thyristor equivalent circuit A are switched into the<br>
conductive state via the first control input j3. The<br>
gate of the field effect transistor T1 is now connected<br>
to the frame potential via the diode D9 and the<br>
conductive collector-emitter path of the bipolar<br>
transistor Q4. The drive signal is therefore extracted<br>
from the gate of the field effect transistor T1, and<br>
the drain-source path of the field effect transistor T1<br>
goes over into the high-resistance or blocked state.<br>
Consequently, the half-bridge inverter Ql, Q2 is shut<br>
down, and cannot be restarted until the discharge lamp<br>
LP is switched on again or exchanged, since the<br>
thyristor equivalent circuit A is reset into the<br>
blocked state of the normal operation again only by<br>
interruption of the voltage supply. This switching off<br>
of the half-bridge inverter is performed synchronously<br>
with tne blocking phase of the transistor Q2. After the<br>
half-bridge inverter has been switched off, the<br>
capacitor C10 is discharged via its parallel resistor<br>
R18.<br>
Switching off the half-bridge inverter upon the<br>
occurrence of the rectifying effect of the discharge<br>
lamp (Anomalous operating state)<br>
The switch-off device Tl, A of the half-bridge inverter<br>
Ql, Q2 is activated either by means of the first device<br>
VI or by means of the second device V2 upon the<br>
occurrence of the rectifying effect in the discharge<br>
lamp LP. As already mentioned further above, the<br>
rectifying effect causes the discharge lamp LP to exert<br>
a rectifying effect on the medium-frequency load<br>
circuit current which flows between the centre taps Ml<br>
and M2. Depending on which current direction is<br>
preferred as a result of the rectifying effect of the<br>
discharge lamp LP, the voltage drop across the coupling<br>
capacitor C3 and the electric potential at the centre<br>
tap M2 are increased or decreased. The rectifying<br>
effect of the discharge lamp LP causes a deviation of<br>
the voltage drop across the coupling capacitor C3 from<br>
its normal value, which is approximately + 2 00 V. If<br>
the deviation of the voltage drop across the coupling<br>
capacitor C3 from its normal value has risen to<br>
virtually 100%, the switch-off device T1, A is<br>
activated by the first device VI or the second device<br>
V2.<br>
If the voltage drop across the coupling capacitor C3 is<br>
approximately + 4 00 V, which corresponds to the entire<br>
input voltage of the half-bridge inverter, the<br>
threshold voltage of the Zener diode D4 of the first<br>
device V1 is reached, and the capacitor C10 is charged<br>
to such an extent that the voltage drop across the<br>
capacitor C10 and the synchronization signal, added<br>
thereto at the tap j5, of the differentiating element<br>
C8, R10 reach the threshold, voltage of the Zener diode<br>
D7, and the transistors Q3, Q4 of the thyristor<br>
equivalent circuit A are switched into the conductive<br>
state via the first control input j3. As a result, the<br>
drain-source path of the field effect transistor Tl is<br>
blocked, and the half-bridge inverter Q1, Q2 is shut<br>
down synchronously with the blocking phase of the<br>
transistor Q2.<br>
If the voltage drop across the coupling capacitor C3 is<br>
very slight and the centre tap M2 is therefore<br>
virtually at frame potential, the pnp transistor Q3 of<br>
the thyristor equivalent circuit A is firstly turned on<br>
via the second control input j4, which is connected to<br>
the centre tap M2 by the series circuit D8, R12 of the<br>
second device V2, and subsequently the npn transistor<br>
Q4 is switched into the conductive state as well. Once<br>
again, the gate drive signal is extracted thereby from<br>
the field effect transistor Tl, with the result that<br>
the drain-source path thereof goes over into the<br>
blocked state and the half-bridge inverter Ql, Q2 is<br>
shut down. The thyristor equivalent circuit A is not<br>
reset into the blocking state, nor is the switch-off<br>
device deactivated until there is an interruption in<br>
the current such as is caused, for example, by<br>
exchanging the discharge lamp LP or by renewed<br>
switching on.<br>
A second preferred exemplary embodiment of the<br>
invention is illustrated in Figure 2. This second<br>
exemplary embodiment differs from the first exemplary<br>
embodiment described in more detail above only in<br>
additional components R21, D13 and D14. In the<br>
remaining components, the second exemplary embodiment<br>
corresponds to the first exemplary embodiment. For this<br>
reason, identical reference symbols have also been<br>
selected for identical components in Figures 1 and 2.<br>
The emitter of the transistor Q3 is connected to the<br>
voltage supply terminal jl via the resistor R21. In the<br>
case of an anomalous operating state, an additional<br>
holding current is provided for the thyristor<br>
equivalent circuit A with the aid of this resistor R21.<br>
The resistor R21 is dimensioned such that the thyristor<br>
equivalent circuit A receives approximately 50 to<br>
80 percent of its holding current via the resistor R21.<br>
The remainder of the holding current component, which<br>
is required to maintain the switched-on state of the<br>
thyristor equivalent circuit A, is provided via the<br>
resistor R5, the electrode filament El of the<br>
low-pressure discharge lamp LP, the resistor R6, and<br>
via the diode D14 polarized in the forward direction.<br>
Permanent switching on of the thyristor equivalent<br>
circuit A is ensured by the additional holding current<br>
flowing via the resistor R21, even in the case when the<br>
potential at the nodal point M2 - caused by the<br>
occurrence of the rectifying effect - is virtually at<br>
frame potential. The diode D14 serves to decouple the<br>
Diac DC from the thyristor equivalent circuit A. The<br>
anode of the diode D14 is connected to a nodal point<br>
arranged between the Diac DC and the resistor R6, while<br>
the cathode of the diode D14 is connected to the<br>
emitter of the transistor Q3. The additional Zener<br>
diode D13 protects the thyristor equivalent circuit A<br>
against overvoltages. For this purpose, the anode of<br>
the Zener diode D13 is connected to the voltage supply<br>
terminal j2, and its cathode is connected to the<br>
emitter of the transistor Q3. The mode of operation of<br>
this circuit arrangement corresponds to that of the<br>
first exemplary embodiment. Upon the occurrence of an<br>
anomalous operating state, the thyristor equivalent<br>
circuit A is reset to the blocking state by exchanging<br>
the lamp LP, since the DC connection to the resistor R6<br>
in the case of the electrode filament El is interrupted<br>
by taking out the lamp LP, and the holding current<br>
still remaining, and flowing via the resistor R21 is<br>
insufficient to leave the thyristor equivalent circuit<br>
A in the switched on state.<br>
The invention is not limited to the exemplary<br>
embodiments described in more detail above. For<br>
example, the invention can also be applied to<br>
half-bridge inverters which have only one coupling<br>
capacitor. Furthermore, the . invention can be used not<br>
only in the case of self-oscillating half-bridge<br>
inverters, but also in the case of externally<br>
controlled half-bridge inverters. Furthermore, the<br>
upper limiting value and the lower limiting value of<br>
the voltage drop across the coupling capacitor C3, at<br>
which the switch-off device is activated, can be set to<br>
other values by suitable dimensioning of the<br>
components.<br>
