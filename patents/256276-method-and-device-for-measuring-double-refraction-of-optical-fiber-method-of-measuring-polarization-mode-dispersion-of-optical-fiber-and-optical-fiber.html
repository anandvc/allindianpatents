BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a method of measurement of birefringence of an optical<br>
fiber and a measurement device, and to an optical fiber polarization mode dispersion<br>
measurement method and an optical fiber, and relates to techniques for the precise and<br>
simple measurement of the birefringence and polarization mode dispersion of an optical<br>
fiber along the length direction.<br>
This application relates to and claims priority from Japanese Patent Application No.<br>
2005-117030, filed on April 14, 2005, and from Japanese Patent Application No. 2005-<br>
229263, filed on August 8, 2005, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by<br>
reference. â€¢<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
In recent years, the faster transmission rates and longer transmission distances of<br>
optical communications have been accompanied by a need to reduce polarization mode<br>
dispersion (hereafter "PMD") along transmission paths. PMD is dispersion which occurs<br>
due to group velocity differences among two eigenpolarization components which are<br>
orthogonal, propagating in an optical fiber (see Patent References 1 and 2 and Non-patent<br>
References 1 to 5).<br>
There are two parameters determining the PMD. One is the magnitude of<br>
birefringence in the optical fiber; the other is the magnitude of the polarization mode<br>
coupling, which indicates changes in the optical fiber length direction of the birefringent<br>
axis in the optical fiber.<br><br>
Specific factors determining PMD in an optical cable transmission path include<br>
ellipticity of the fiber core, asymmetry or the like of stresses occurring in the core, and other<br>
factors arising within the optical fiber, as well as asymmetry of stresses due to optical fiber<br>
bending in optical cable manufacturing processes and other factors arising from processes to<br>
produce optical cable. Hence in order to prevent worsening of PMD in optical cables due to<br>
factors within optical fibers, it is desirable that PMD arising from factors within the optical<br>
fiber be measured before processes to manufacture optical cable, and that optical fibers with<br>
poor PMD characteristics be excluded.<br>
Optical fiber is normally wound on a bobbin for transport to the site of the process<br>
for optical cable manufacture. But an optical fiber wound on a bobbin is subject to bending<br>
and to birefringence caused by lateral pressure while wound on the bobbin; in addition,<br>
optical fibers will come into contact with each other or will be subjected to considerable<br>
torsion while being taken up on the bobbin, so that polarization mode coupling is induced.<br>
Consequently the PMD of an optical fiber wound on a bobbin does not coincide with the<br>
PMD arising from factors within the optical fiber.<br>
Hence in order to measure PMD arising from factors within the optical fiber, a<br>
method is employed in which the optical fiber is removed from the bobbin and is wound<br>
with a diameter of from 20 cm to 100 cm, and by immersing the fiber in a liquid having a<br>
specific gravity close to that of the optical fiber, birefringence arising from lateral pressure<br>
and small-radius bending, as well as polarization mode coupling arising from contact<br>
between optical fibers, are eliminated, and the PMD is measured. This PMD measurement<br>
is for example described in Non-patent Reference 5.<br>
As is stated in Non-patent Reference 4, PMD has statistical properties, and so<br>
measurements are attended by uncertainty. In order to reduce this uncertainty, methods<br>
may be used to increase the total PMD of the optical fiber for measurement, or expand the<br>
wavelengths for measurement, or apply perturbations to the optical fiber being measured<br>
and perform measurements a plurality of times.<br>

However, there are the following problems with the PMD measurement methods of<br>
the prior art.<br>
In order to increase the total PMD of the optical fiber for measurement, the total<br>
length of the optical fiber for measurement must be made long if the optical fiber for<br>
measurement has a small PMD; but because an optical fiber used in PMD measurements in<br>
the free state cannot again be used as a product, this method requires a long optical fiber<br>
each time a measurement is performed, so that waste is substantial. Further, methods<br>
entailing expansion of the wavelengths for measurement are subject to constraints imposed<br>
by the operating wavelengths of the light source, and so there are limits to the use of such<br>
methods. And, methods requiring a plurality of measurements require time to perform<br>
measurements and are inefficient.<br>
Next, another technology of the prior art, and problems with this technology, are<br>
described. Because there are large fluctuations in PMD depending on the preform and<br>
drawing conditions of the optical fiber, normally optical fibers manufactured under identical<br>
conditions exhibit substantially the same PMD value, but due to unanticipated causes, there<br>
are cases of partial worsening of the PMD, and so it is desirable that length-direction<br>
measurements be performed.<br><br>
Methods of the prior art for longitudinal measurement of the birefringence and PMD<br>
include the methods described in Patent References 1 and 2. These methods involve<br>
measurement of the birefringence and PMD based on the amount of scattering in the OTDR<br>
waveform observed when a polarizer is placed between the OTDR and the optical fiber for<br>
measurement. However, these measurement methods are accompanied by a number of<br>
problems.<br>
First, in methods of the prior art, the waveform amplitude differs depending on the<br>
incident polarization state and on the birefringence axis angle of the optical fiber, and so<br>
there is the problem that measurements cannot be performed accurately. For example,<br>
when the incident polarization is linear polarization, the amplitude is maximum when the<br>
angle between the direction of linear polarization and the birefringence axis is 45Â°, but<br>
when the two directions coincide, the amplitude is zero. This problem has a serious impact<br>
on the results of measurement of polarization mode dispersion using conventional methods.<br>
Further, in methods of the prior art, scattering from the least-square approximating<br>
line is used as an index of the scattering in the OTDR waveform; to this end, averaging<br>
must be performed over a certain interval, and so it is inherently not possible to obtain a<br>
high resolution.<br>
Moreover, a feature of methods of the prior art is the simple configuration obtained<br>
by using a general-purpose OTDR; but because the light source of a general-purpose OTDR<br>
has a broad spectral width from 5 nm to 20 nm, once a point with large PMD is traversed, a<br>
phenomenon occurs in which the polarization state of the pulse differs with the wavelength,<br>
and so the amplitude is averaged and becomes smaller; hence there is the problem that<br>
subsequent PMD measurements cannot be performed (see Non-patent Reference 1).<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention was devised in light of the above circumstances, and has as an object<br>
the provision of a method of measurement, with accuracy and in a short length of time, of<br>
the birefringence and PMD of a short optical fiber having a comparatively small PMD in<br>
the free state and a device therefore.<br><br>
A further object of this invention is the provision of a method and device for the<br>
accurate longitudinal measurement of birefringence and PMD of an optical fiber in the free<br>
state with arbitrary resolution, and such that even when a point with large PMD exists<br>
midway in the fiber, there is no influence on subsequent measurement results.<br>
In order to attain the above objects, this invention provides a method of<br>
measurement of the birefringence of an optical fiber, in which the round-trip Jones matrix<br>
R(z) for a first interval (0, z) from a measurement starting point 0 in the optical fiber for<br>
measurement to a prescribed position z, and the round-trip Jones matrix R(z+Î”z) for a<br>
second interval (0, z+Î”z) from the measurement starting point 0 to a position z+Î”z differing<br>
from the position z, are acquired, the eigenvalues p1, p2 of the matrix R(z+Î”z)R(z)-1 are<br>
determined, and by computing the following equations (1) and (2),<br><br>
(where Ï• represents the phase difference between linear polarization components<br>
due to birefringence, An represents birefringence, and Î» represents wavelength), the<br>
birefringence in the infinitesimal interval Î”z from the position z to the position z+Î”z is<br>
obtained.<br>
In an optical fiber birefringence measurement method of this invention, it is<br>
preferable that a polarization OTDR be used to acquire the round-trip Jones matrices of the<br>
optical fiber for measurement.<br>
Further, this invention provides an optical fiber birefringence measurement device,<br>
having timing control means; pulse light generation means, controlled by the timing control<br>
means; polarization conversion means which converts pulse light from the pulse light<br>
generation means into a polarized state; optical recirculation means which inputs pulse light<br>
from the polarization conversion means to one end of the optical fiber for measurement, and<br>
which outputs backscattered light returning to one end of the optical fiber for measurement;<br><br>
polarization detection means, controlled by the timing control means, which detects the<br>
polarization state of light output from the optical recirculation means as a time series; and<br>
analysis means, which, based on the output of the polarization detection means, uses the<br>
birefringence measurement method to measure the birefringence of the optical fiber for<br>
measurement.<br>
Further, this invention provides an optical fiber polarization mode dispersion<br>
measurement method, in which the birefringence of the optical fiber for measurement in the<br>
free state, measured using the optical fiber birefringence method, and the relation to the<br>
polarization mode dispersion of the optical fiber for measurement in the free state, are used<br>
to measure the polarization mode dispersion of the optical fiber for measurement in the free<br>
state.<br>
Further, this invention provides an optical fiber polarization mode dispersion<br>
measurement method, in which a portion of an optical fiber wound onto a bobbin is<br>
removed, and after using the optical fiber polarization mode dispersion measurement<br>
method to measure the polarization mode dispersion, the measured value of the polarization<br>
mode dispersion is taken to be the polarization mode dispersion when the entire optical fiber<br>
wound around the bobbin is placed into the free state.<br>
Further, this invention provides an optical fiber polarization mode dispersion<br>
measurement method, in which the birefringence of the optical fiber for measurement in the<br>
free state, measured using the optical fiber birefringence measurement method, and the<br>
relation to the polarization mode dispersion of the optical fiber for measurement in the free<br>
state, are used to measure the polarization mode dispersion of the optical fiber for<br>
measurement in the free state, while in the state of being wound around a bobbin.<br>
Further, this invention provides an optical fiber polarization mode dispersion<br>
measurement method, in which the birefringence of the optical fiber for measurement in the<br>
state of being wound around a bobbin, measured using the optical fiber birefringence<br>
measurement method, and the relation to the polarization mode dispersion of the optical<br>
fiber for measurement in the free state, are used to measure the polarization mode<br><br>
dispersion of the optical fiber for measurement in the free state, while in the state of being<br>
wound around the bobbin.<br>
In the polarization mode dispersion measurement method, the amount of twist<br>
applied to the optical fiber for measurement in the state of being wound around the bobbin<br>
may be 1 rad/m or less.<br>
In the polarization mode dispersion measurement method, the birefringence may be<br>
measured for a portion in which the effects of the tension of takeup on the bobbin and of<br>
lateral pressure due to the taken-up optical fiber itself are small, and this birefringence of<br>
the optical fiber for measurement may be used as a representative value, and used as the<br>
polarization mode dispersion of the optical fiber when the entire optical fiber wound around<br>
the bobbin is placed in the free state.<br>
In the polarization mode dispersion measurement method, cushion material may be<br>
positioned at a place at which the optical fiber for measurement is in contact with the<br>
bobbin around which the optical fiber is wound, to reduce lateral pressure on the optical<br>
fiber, and in addition the effect of polarization state fluctuations during measurements<br>
arising from expansion and shrinkage of the bobbin due to temperature changes in the<br>
measurement environment may be eliminated.<br>
In the polarization mode dispersion measurement method, upon temporarily relaxed<br>
the tension of the optical fiber, the birefringence of the optical fiber for measurement may<br>
be measured while in the state of being wound around the bobbin, and the polarization<br>
mode dispersion of the optical fiber in the free state may be measured.<br>
Further, this invention provides an optical fiber the polarization mode dispersion of<br>
which, as measured by the above optical fiber polarization mode dispersion measurement<br>
method, is 0.1ps/km or less.<br>
In this optical fiber, the amount of twist applied, in the state of being wound around<br>
the bobbin, may be 1 rad/m or less.<br>
In this optical fiber, the value of, or the upper limit of, the measured polarization<br>
mode dispersion may be displayed.<br><br>
According to this invention, the round-trip Jones matrix R(z) for a first interval (0,z)<br>
from a measurement starting point 0 in the optical fiber for measurement to a prescribed<br>
position z and the round-trip Jones matrix R(z+Î”z) for a second interval (0, z+Î”z) from the<br>
measurement starting point 0 to a position z+Az differing from the position z in the optical<br>
fiber for measurement are acquired, the eigenvalues p1, p2 of the matrix R(z+Î”z)R(z)_1 are<br>
determined, and the birefringence of the infinitesimal interval Î”z is obtained by calculation,<br>
and, the PMD of the optical fiber is obtained from the optical fiber birefringence thus<br>
obtained, so that a method and device for the accurate measurement, in a short length of<br>
time, of the birefringence and PMD of a short optical fiber, in the free state and having<br>
comparatively small PMD, can be provided.<br>
Further, this invention can provide a method and device to measure, accurately and<br>
with arbitrary resolution, the length-direction birefringence and PMD of an optical fiber in<br>
the free state, and moreover even when a point with large PMD exists midway in the fiber,<br>
there is no influence on subsequent measurement results.<br>
Further, by means of this invention the PMD of an optical fiber in the free state can<br>
be estimated for the optical fiber in the state of being wound around a bobbin, or in a state<br>
of being wound around a bobbin with the tension temporarily relaxed.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Below, preferred embodiments of the invention are explained, referring to the<br>
drawings. However, the invention is not limited to the following embodiments, and for<br>
example constituent elements of these embodiments may be appropriately combined.<br>
First, a method of measurement of birefringence of an optical fiber according to this<br>
invention is explained.<br>
FIG. 1 is a summary diagram to explain the measurement interval in an optical fiber<br>
birefringence measurement method of this invention. In the birefringence measurement<br>
method of the invention, a first interval (0, z) is set from a measurement starting point 0 to a<br>
prescribed position z in the optical fiber for measurement, and a second interval (0, z+Î”z)<br>
from the measurement starting point 0 to a position z+Az different from the position z is set;<br><br>
the interval from the position z to the position z+Î”z (the interval which is the difference<br>
between the first interval and the second interval) is the infinitesimal interval Az.<br>
Further, if the one-way Jones matrix for the first interval (0, z) is J1, the one-way<br>
Jones matrix for the infinitesimal interval Î”z is J2, and the round-trip Jones matrix for the<br>
first interval (0, z) is R (z), then the relation of the following equation (3) obtains.<br><br>
Here, upon considering the matrix R(z+Î”z)R(z)"', the following equation (4) is<br>
obtained.<br><br>
In optical fiber in the free state and in optical fiber within optical cable, changes in<br>
the birefringence axis of the optical fiber and torsion applied to the optical fiber are gradual,<br>
and so the infinitesimal interval Î”z can be regarded as having only a linear birefringence,<br>
and the birefringence axis angle can also be regarded as constant. Then the one-way Jones<br>
matrix J2 for the infinitesimal intervalh Î”z 	is given by the following equation (5), where the<br>
angle of the fast axis of birefringence is 0 and the phase difference between orthogonal<br>
polarization due to birefringence is <j></j><br>
(In equation (5), P2 is a matrix the components of which are eigenvectors of the<br>
matrix J2, and Q2 is a diagonal matrix the diagonal components of which are eigenvalues of<br>
the matrix J2.) Hence the following equation (6) obtains.<br><br>
In this case, the following equation (7) results.<br><br><br>
On the other hand, upon diagonalization, R(z+Î”z)R(z)-1 can be expressed as in<br>
equation (8).<br><br>
Therefore the following equation (9) obtains.<br><br>
Hence it is seen that the diagonal matrix Q' obtained by diagonalizing the matrix<br>
R(z+Î”z)R(z)-1 is the square of the diagonal matrix Q2 obtained by diagonalizing the Jones<br>
matrix J2 for the infinitesimal interval (z, z+Î”z). That is, the following equation (10)<br>
obtains.<br><br>
The diagonal elements of Q' are eigenvalues of R (z+Î”z) R (z)_1, so that if the two<br>
eigenvalues p1, p2 of R(z+Î”z)R(z)-1 are given by equation (11),<br><br>
then the following equations (12) and (13)<br><br><br><br>
can be used to obtain the measured birefringence of an arbitrary infinitesimal<br>
interval Î”z, that is, the longitudinal birefringence.<br>
By performing averaging processing of birefringence values measured in this way<br>
according to the required resolution, birefringence measurements with arbitrary resolution<br>
can be performed.<br>
In computations of birefringence according to a birefringence measurement method<br>
of this invention, no constraints in particular are placed on the Jones matrix for the first<br>
interval (0,z), and so regardless of the properties of the Jones matrix for the first interval<br>
(0,z), there is no effect on measurements.<br>
Next, an aspect of an optical fiber birefringence measurement device of this<br>
invention is explained, referring to the drawings.<br>
Fig. 2 is a configuration diagram of an aspect of an optical fiber birefringence<br>
measurement device of this invention. The birefringence measurement device 1 of this<br>
aspect comprises timing control means 11; pulse light generation means 12, controlled by<br>
the timing control means 11; polarization conversion means 13, which converts the<br>
polarization state of pulse light from the pulse light generation means 12; optical<br>
recirculation means 14, which inputs pulse light from the polarization conversion means 13<br>
to one end of the optical fiber for measurement, and which outputs backscattered light<br>
returning to one end of the optical fiber for measurement; polarization detection means 15,<br>
controlled by the timing control means 11, which detects the polarization state of light<br>
output from the optical recirculation means 14 as a time series; and analysis means 16,<br>
which, based on the output of the polarization detection means 15, uses the birefringence<br>
measurement method described above to measure the birefringence of the optical fiber for<br>
measurement 2.<br>
In the birefringence measurement device 1 of this aspect, pulse light output from the<br>
pulse light generation means 12 controlled by the timing control means 11 is input to the<br><br>
polarization conversion means 13, and after conversion into three different polarization<br>
states, is output.<br>
Pulse light output from the polarization conversion means 13 is input to one end of<br>
the optical fiber for measurement 2 from the optical recirculation means 14, and<br>
backscattered light returning to this end is input from the optical recirculation means 14 to<br>
the polarization analysis means 15, which is controlled by the timing control means 11, and<br>
the polarization state of the returning light is detected as time-series data.<br>
In measurement of the polarization state, the intensities of four polarization<br>
components comprised by the returning light, which are the horizontal polarization<br>
component, vertical polarization component, 45Â° linear polarization component, and right-<br>
circular polarization component, are measured as time series, the Stokes parameters are<br>
computed, and fully polarized components are converted into Jones vectors (see Non-patent<br>
Reference 2). By performing these operations using time series, polarization states can be<br>
detected as time series.<br>
The analysis means 16 measures the round-trip Jones matrix of the optical fiber for<br>
measurement 2 from the time-series data for polarization states of returning light, for the<br>
three types of polarization states resulting from conversion by the polarization conversion<br>
means 13. A method for computation of the Jones matrix from output polarized light for<br>
three different types of input polarized light is for example described in detail in Non-patent<br>
Reference 3.<br>
Next, the configuration of the pulse light generation means 12 used in this<br>
birefringence measurement device 1 is described. The light source of a general-use OTDR<br>
has a broad spectral width of 5 nm to 20 nm, and so upon passing a point with large PMD, a<br>
phenomenon occurs in which the polarization states in the pulse differ with wavelength, and<br>
the amplitude is averaged and becomes smaller, so that there is the well-known problem<br>
that subsequent PMD can no longer be measured (see Non-patent Reference 1). Hence it is<br>
desirable that the pulse light output from the pulse light generation means 12 have a narrow<br>
spectral width.<br><br>
However, as the spectral width of the pulse light is made narrow, another problem<br>
arises. As the spectral width becomes narrow, the light source coherence is increased, so<br>
that there is interference with backscattered light from different positions, appearing as<br>
substantial noise during OTDR measurements. This is called coherent noise.<br>
As one effective method to eliminate the effect of coherent noise on the OTDR<br>
waveform, a phase adjuster 122 which utilizes an electrooptic effect, acoustooptic effect or<br>
similar is placed in a stage beyond the pulse light source 121 of the pulse light generation<br>
means 12, as shown in FIG. 3, so that the spectral width of the pulse light source 121 is<br>
broadened sufficiently that changes in polarization state due to changes in wavelength can<br>
be ignored, reducing coherence. In addition, by placing a wavelength filter in a stage<br>
beyond the pulse light source 121 with a broad spectral width, changes in polarization state<br>
due to wavelength changes can be ignored, and similar advantageous results can be obtained<br>
even when the spectral width is narrowed to an extent such that coherence is not a problem.<br>
The wavelength spectral width must be such that changes in polarization state due to<br>
wavelength changes at different points in the optical fiber for measurement 2 can be<br>
ignored; because this is determined by the magnitude of the cumulative PMD at each point<br>
in the optical fiber for measurement 2, the spectral width cannot be uniquely determined,<br>
but a spectral width of 0.1 nm is sufficient to eliminate coherent noise, and a larger width is<br>
unnecessary.<br>
Next, another aspect of pulse light generation means 12 used in an optical fiber<br>
birefringence measurement device 1 of this invention is described. As shown in FIG. 4, if<br>
an optical amplifier 123 is positioned within the pulse light generation means 12, the pulse<br>
light is amplified, and so measurements can be performed over a longer distance. In this<br>
case, the optical amplifier 123 emits light spontaneously, and so it is preferable that<br>
spontaneous emission suppression means 124 be positioned in a stage beyond the optical<br>
amplifier 123, such that spontaneous emission is not input to the optical fiber for<br>
measurement 2 at times when pulses are not output. As the spontaneous emission<br>
suppression means, an acoustooptic modulator or other optical modulator can be used.<br><br>
Next, the polarization conversion means 13 is described. The polarization<br>
conversion means 13 used in this invention must be able to form three different polarization<br>
states, and must be configured such that the polarization states formed can be ascertained.<br>
As shown in FIG. 5, when a wave plate 131 is used independently as the polarization<br>
conversion means, if the polarization state of light incident on the wave plate 131 changes,<br>
the emission light polarization state changes; hence it is desirable that the entire optical path<br>
from emission of linearly polarized light by the pulse light generation means 12 up to the<br>
polarization conversion means 13 be configured using polarization-maintaining components<br>
(polarization-maintaining optical fiber or other polarization-maintaining waveguides), so<br>
that the polarization state of light incident on the polarization conversion means 13 is kept<br>
constant.<br>
Next, another polarization conversion means 13 of this invention is described. As<br>
shown in FIG. 6, if a polarizer 132 is used as the polarization conversion means 13, then<br>
even when the polarization state of light incident on the polarization conversion means 13 is<br>
indefinite, the light emitted from the polarization conversion means 13 is linearly polarized<br>
light. Hence it is preferable that, by changing the angle of the polarizer 13, an arbitrary<br>
linearly polarized state can be created. Here, there are cases in which, by changing the<br>
angle of the polarizer 132, the emission power from the polarizer 132 is decreased<br>
according to the angle, and the SN ratio of OTDR measurements is lowered. Hence as<br>
shown in FIG. 8, it is preferable that another polarization conversion means 18 be<br>
positioned in a stage before the polarization conversion means 13, so that by changing the<br>
state of polarization of light input to the polarization conversion means 13, the emission<br>
power from the polarizer in the polarization conversion means 13 can be adjusted.<br>
Next, still another polarization conversion means 13 of the invention is described.<br>
When a configuration is employed in which a polarizer 133 and a wave plate 134 placed in<br>
a later stage are used as the polarization conversion means 13, as shown in FIG. 7, even<br>
when the polarization state of light input to the polarization conversion means 13 is<br>
indefinite, the light output from the polarizer 13 is linearly polarized light, and a<br>
polarization state is created by the wave plate 134, which is preferable. In this case, it is<br>
preferable that a configuration be employed in which, by changing the angle of the polarizer<br><br>
133 according to the state of polarization of light input to the polarization conversion means<br>
13, the power output from the polarizer 133 can be adjusted. And, it is still more preferable<br>
that a configuration be employed in which another polarization conversion means 18 be<br>
placed in a stage before the polarization conversion means 13, so that by changing the<br>
polarization state of light input to the polarization conversion means 13, the power emitted<br>
from the polarizer in the polarization conversion means 13 can be adjusted.<br>
Next, another aspect of a birefringence measurement device of the invention is<br>
described. The polarization state of light passing through an optical fiber varies greatly<br>
when the optical fiber is subjected to bending, external forces, and other perturbations from<br>
outside. Hence when using polarizers 132, 133 in the polarization conversion means 13, if a<br>
perturbation is applied from outside during measurements in the optical path connecting the<br>
pulse light generation means 12 and the polarization conversion means 13, the quantities of<br>
light passing through the polarizers 132 and 133 in the polarization conversion means 13<br>
change, and there is a large impact on the measurement results. Hence as shown in FIG. 9,<br>
it is preferable that optical branching means 19 and optical detection means 20 be placed in<br>
a stage beyond the polarization conversion means 13, that changes in the quantities of light<br>
passing through the polarizers 132 and 133 be measured, and that monitoring for the<br>
presence of the effect of perturbations be performed, as well as controlling the polarization<br>
conversion means 13 such that adequate pulse light intensity is always obtained.<br>
Next, still another aspect of a birefringence measurement device of the invention is<br>
described. When similar perturbations are applied to the optical fiber for measurement 2<br>
during measurements, the Jones matrix for the optical fiber changes, and there is an effect<br>
on the measurement results. Hence a method in which two or more measurements are<br>
performed for the same input polarization and the results are compared, to monitor whether<br>
perturbations have been applied to the optical fiber for measurement 2 during measurements,<br>
is effective. Specifically, a configuration can be employed in which, by incorporating the<br>
above-described measurement program into the analysis means 16, performing two or more<br>
measurements with the same input polarization, and comparing the results, it is possible to<br>
display whether perturbations have been applied to the optical fiber for measurement 2<br>
during measurements. There may not be a need to perform two or more measurements for<br><br>
all three input polarizations; normally it is sufficient to perform two measurements with the<br>
same input polarization state at the beginning and at the end, and to compare the<br>
measurement results.<br>
Next, a PMD measurement method of this invention is explained. A feature of a<br>
PMD measurement method of this invention is the determination of PMD in the optical<br>
fiber for measurement 2 based on the birefringence of the optical fiber for measurement 2<br>
measured using an above-described birefringence measurement method of this invention.<br>
As explained above, PMD is determined based on two factors, which are the local<br>
birefringence and polarization mode coupling. Hence when polarization mode coupling can<br>
be regarded as substantially constant, and when a fixed relation exists between the<br>
magnitude of local birefringence and polarization mode coupling, the value of polarization<br>
mode coupling can be measured using the local birefringence, and so the PMD value can be<br>
measured.<br>
In general, the larger the birefringence of an optical fiber placed in the free state, the<br>
smaller is the polarization mode coupling, and the smaller the birefringence, the larger is the<br>
polarization mode coupling; hence there exists a fixed relation between the magnitude of<br>
the birefringence and the polarization mode coupling, and by determining this relation<br>
experimentally in advance, the PMD can be measured through the magnitude of the<br>
birefringence. This method is particularly effective when measuring the PMD in a short<br>
optical fiber in which the PMD in the free state is comparatively small.<br>
An optical fiber of total length 3000 m was actually placed in the free state, and a<br>
measurement device of this invention was used to measure the birefringence at a<br>
wavelength of 1.55 um. Then, the PMD of the optical fiber in the free state was measured<br>
for the 1.55 um wavelength band; the results are compared in FIG. 13. The PMD<br>
measurement results of FIG. 13 were obtained by changing the installed state of the optical<br>
fiber upon each measurement, performing 10 measurements of the PMD with the optical<br>
fiber in the free state, and averaging the results.<br>
FIG. 14 compares one measurement result extracted from the ten results with the<br>
average of 10 measurements in the PMD measurements of the optical fiber in the free state.<br><br>
Due to the statistical nature of PMD, the average value of the 10 measurements is thought to<br>
be closer to the true value; but on comparing FIG. 13 and FIG. 14, it is seen that the results<br>
of comparison with the birefringence measured using a method of this invention clearly<br>
shows stronger correlation than the results of comparison with the single PMD<br>
measurement. Hence the method of this invention is capable of accurate PMD<br>
measurement.<br>
According to Non-patent Reference 4, when the PMD measurement precision is<br>
represented by the standard deviation a from the true value, then a is inversely proportional<br>
to the 1/2 power of the total PMD. Further, because the total PMD is proportional to the 1/2<br>
power of the optical fiber length, a is inversely proportional to the 1/4 power of the optical<br>
fiber length. Hence, while in this embodiment 3000 m of optical fiber were used, if 1000 m<br>
of optical fiber were used the figure would be worsened by approximately 1.6 times; if 300<br>
m were used, the figure would be worsened by approximately 1.8 times; and if 100 m were<br>
used, the figure would be worsened by approximately 2.3 times. Hence when a shorter<br>
optical fiber than in this embodiment was used to perform similar measurements, the<br>
correlation shown in FIG. 14 is expected to be a weaker correlation. On the other hand,<br>
because birefringence is not a statistical quantity, the measurement precision is not affected<br>
by the length of the optical fiber measured. Thus the method of this invention is<br>
particularly useful, compared with methods for direct PMD measurement of the prior art,<br>
when measuring the PMD of a short optical fiber with a comparatively small PMD.<br>
Next, another PMD measurement method of this invention is described. As<br>
explained above, the PMD of optical fiber wound on a bobbin and the PMD when placed in<br>
the free state do not agree. However, in cases where the magnitude of the birefringence due<br>
to an external force applied from outside is small compared with the magnitude of the<br>
internal birefringence, or when the torsion applied to the optical fiber is small, the<br>
birefringence values of the optical fiber in the two states are nearly the same. In such cases,<br>
a relation exists between the birefringence of the optical fiber wound on the bobbin and the<br>
birefringence of the optical fiber placed in the free state; and the PMD of the optical fiber<br>
placed in the free state can be measured from the birefringence of the optical fiber wound<br>
on the bobbin.<br><br>
In cases in which torsion or lateral pressure is applied after optical fiber<br>
solidification, the value of birefringence measured using a method of this invention is<br>
affected, and differs from the birefringence of the optical fiber placed in the free state; but<br>
when the entire optical fiber undergoes similar processes and is taken up on a bobbin, that is,<br>
in general manufacturing processes, the effect is substantially constant. Hence when the<br>
effect can be regarded as constant, a relation exists between the value of birefringence<br>
measured by a method of this invention in the state of being wound on a bobbin, and the<br>
value of the birefringence for the optical fiber placed in the free state. Consequently by<br>
measuring the birefringence of the optical fiber wound on a bobbin, the PMD of the optical<br>
fiber placed in the free state can be measured.<br>
Next, twist applied to an optical fiber subjected to measurements while wound on a<br>
bobbin is discussed. In a birefringence measurement method of this invention, it is assumed<br>
that the infinitesimal interval (z, z+Î”z) has only linear birefringence, and that the direction<br>
of the birefringent axis is also constant. In an optical fiber in the free state and in an optical<br>
fiber in an optical cable, the amount of twist is small, and so this assumption poses no<br>
problems. However, when a large twist is applied to an optical fiber wound on a bobbin<br>
due to the takeup process, there is an effect on the value of the birefringence measured<br>
using a method of this invention. This effect was computed using numerical calculations,<br>
and the range of applicability of methods of this invention was studied.<br>
In calculations, the infinitesimal interval Î”z was set to a length of 1 m, which is<br>
generally the resolution of OTDR. Calculation of the Jones matrix for the infinitesimal<br>
interval was performed by further dividing the infinitesimal interval into 0.001 m intervals,<br>
and rotating birefringent axis of adjacent intervals by the amount of twist. The Jones matrix<br>
for a 0.001 m interval was computed by multiplying the Jones matrix representing only the<br>
effect of rotatory power in the interval by the Jones matrix representing only the effect of<br>
linear birefringence in the interval. Waveguide dispersion and material dispersion of the<br>
optical fiber were not considered, and the light propagating in the optical fiber was<br>
approximated by a plane wave. The magnitude of the birefringence before twist application<br>
An was taken to be 1.55xl0"7, the rotatory power a to be 0.07, and the wavelength to be<br><br>
1.55 jam. These are representative values for optical fibers and wavelengths widely used in<br>
current optical communication systems.<br>
FIG. 10 shows the amount of change in the magnitude of the birefringence measured<br>
by a method of the invention, when the amount of twist was variously changed. From FIG.<br>
10, if the amount of twist applied to the optical fiber was 1 rad/m, then the magnitude of the<br>
birefringence measured using a method of the invention matched the magnitude of the<br>
birefringence when there was no twist with a difference of approximately 10%. However,<br>
when the twist amount was 2 rad/m, the difference was approximately 40%. Hence it is<br>
preferable that the amount of twist applied to an optical fiber measured using a method of<br>
this invention to be 1 rad/m or less.<br>
In recent years there have been cases in which a method has been used of effectively<br>
reducing the birefringence, by applying spin prior to solidification of the glass during<br>
drawing from molten glass of optical fiber and changing the birefringent axis direction, to<br>
reduce the optical fiber PMD. The effective birefringence magnitude An' in the<br>
infinitesimal interval can be determined from the phase difference (j&gt; occurring between two<br>
orthogonal intrinsic polarizations which are intrinsic to the infinitesimal interval, and after<br>
diagonalizing the Jones matrix for the infinitesimal interval to equation (14),<br><br>
An' can be computed from the following equations (15) and (16).<br><br>
In this case also, the birefringent axis direction in the infinitesimal interval Î”z is not<br>
constant, and so may affect the value of birefringence measured using a method of this<br><br>
invention. This effect was computed using numerical calculations, to study the range of<br>
applicability of methods of this invention. The calculation conditions were the same.<br>
First, FIG. 11 shows the calculated differences occurring in the magnitude of the<br>
effective birefringence in the interval Î”z and in the magnitude of birefringence measured by<br>
a method of this invention, when spin is applied in a constant direction before optical fiber<br>
solidification, and the amount of applied spin is varied.<br>
FIG. 12 shows the results of similar calculations for cases in which sinusoidal spin is<br>
applied before optical fiber solidification. Sinusoidal spin is a method of application of spin<br>
such that the following equation (17)<br><br>
obtains between the spin angle 9 at a point at a distance z, the spin amplitude A, and<br>
the spin period P.<br>
From FIG. 11 and FIG. 12, it is seen that even when spin is applied in a constant<br>
direction before optical fiber solidification, and even when sinusoidal spin is applied before<br>
optical fiber solidification, the magnitude of birefringence measured by a method of this<br>
invention agrees well with the effective birefringence magnitude. Hence when the effective<br>
birefringence is lowered by applying spin before optical fiber solidification, a method of<br>
this invention can be used for accurate measurement of birefringence.<br>
Next, another PMD measurement method of this invention is explained. If the effect<br>
of an external force applied to the optical fiber for measurement by the bobbin is small, a<br>
method of this invention can be used to measure the PMD of the optical fiber placed in the<br>
free state, but when the tension of takeup onto the bobbin is high, there is an effect of lateral<br>
pressure due to the tension, and there are cases in which it is difficult to reduce the effect on<br>
birefringence of the external force applied across the entire length of the optical fiber for<br>
measurement. FIG. 15 shows the results of longitudinal measurement, from the outermost<br>
periphery, of the beat length of optical fiber wound around a bobbin. From FIG. 15, it is<br>
seen that in the state of being wound around the bobbin, the further toward the inner<br>
periphery, the larger is the birefringence.<br><br>
On the other hand, the birefringence of an optical fiber is frequently due to the<br>
preform of the optical fiber; if the preform is the same, often the magnitude of the<br>
birefringence is substantially the same. In such cases, such locations that the effect on the<br>
birefringence due to the applied external force is small, the birefringence in the vicinity of<br>
the outermost periphery of the wound optical fiber can usually be measured and taken as a<br>
representative value of the birefringence for the optical fiber for measurement, and used to<br>
measure the PMD of the optical fiber placed in the free state.<br>
FIG. 16 compares the birefringence actually measured over an interval of 500 m<br>
from the outermost periphery in the state of being wound on a bobbin with the PMD<br>
measured when the entire optical fiber wound on the bobbin was placed in the free state.<br>
From FIG. 16 it is seen that by measuring the birefringence of the outer peripheral portion<br>
while in the state of being wound on the bobbin, the result can be used as a representative<br>
value of the PMD when the entire optical fiber wound on the bobbin is placed in the free<br>
state.<br>
Next, the form of bobbins for which use of the methods of this invention are suited<br>
is discussed. If the effect of external force applied by the bobbin to the optical fiber for<br>
measurement is small, then when the above method is used to measure the PMD of an<br>
optical fiber placed on the free state, measurements can be performed over a longer distance<br>
from the outer peripheral portion. To this end, it is preferable that a cushion material be<br>
placed at locations at which the bobbin and the optical fiber for measurement make contact,<br>
to reduce the effect of external force applied to the optical fiber for measurement. One<br>
perturbing factor acting on an optical fiber for measurement during measurements is the<br>
perturbations due to changes in lateral pressure applied to the fiber when the bobbin around<br>
which the optical fiber is wound expands or contracts due to changes in temperature; it is<br>
preferable that cushion material be used to prevent the application of perturbations to the<br>
optical fiber for measurement even when expansion or contraction of the bobbin occurs.<br>
Further, it is preferable that the bobbin be configured so as to enable temporary<br>
removal of tension on the optical fiber for measurement, and that a measurement method be<br>
used in which, having removed tension temporarily from the optical fiber during<br>
measurements, after measuring the PMD using a method of this invention, the tension is<br><br>
returned to the original state. This method is particularly effective when the bobbin takeup<br>
tension is high, and the birefringence arising from winding onto the bobbin is high.<br>
Next, a method of longitudinal measurement of the PMD and birefringence of an<br>
optical fiber is described. Using a method of this invention, the birefringence can be<br>
determined longitudinally along an optical fiber, and so using the relation between<br>
birefringence and PMD described above, the PMD can be measured longitudinally.<br>
FIG. 17 compares the results when an optical fiber of total length 5000 m, drawn<br>
from molten glass such that circularity of the optical fiber was partially worsened, and in a<br>
state of being wound on a bobbin, was subjected to longitudinal birefringence<br>
measurements by a method of this invention, and was then divided in two at the 2500 m<br>
point and subjected to PMD measurements in the free state. From FIG. 17, it is seen that by<br>
using a method of this invention, the PMD in the free state in the length direction can be<br>
measured longitudinally even when the optical fiber is wound on a bobbin.<br>
Further, it is preferable that a configuration be adopted in which cushion material is<br>
placed in locations at which the bobbin and the optical fiber for measurement make contact<br>
or the tension on the optical fiber for measurement due to the bobbin be temporarily<br>
removed, and that, with the tension on the optical fiber temporarily removed during<br>
measurements, that the PMD be measured in the length direction by a method of this<br>
invention, enabling detection of longitudinal PMD fluctuations with extremely high<br>
precision.<br>
FIG. 18 compares the results when an optical fiber of total length 3000 m, drawn<br>
from molten glass such that circularity of the optical fiber was partially worsened, was<br>
wound onto a bobbin configured to enable temporary removal of tension on the optical fiber<br>
for measurement, after which tension was temporarily removed and the longitudinal<br>
birefringence was measured by a method of this invention, following which the fiber was<br>
divided in two at the 1500 m point, and PMD measurements were performed in the free<br>
state. From FIG. 18, it is seen that by using a method of this invention, even extremely<br>
small longitudinal PMD changes can be detected.<br><br>
This invention provides an optical fiber the polarization mode dispersion of which,<br>
as measured by the above-described optical fiber polarization mode dispersion measurement<br>
method, is 0.1 ps/^lkm or less. An optical fiber of this invention may be a quartz glass<br>
single-mode optical fiber (hereafter "SM fiber") or a polarization-maintaining optical fiber<br>
or similar, but is not limited to these.<br>
An optical fiber of this invention can be provided in a state of being wound on a<br>
bobbin; it is preferable that, in the state of being wound on a bobbin, the amount of torsion<br>
applied be 1 rad/m or less. If the torsion amount is 1 rad/m or less, then the birefringence<br>
measured in the state of being wound around the bobbin agrees with the magnitude of the<br>
birefringence when there is no twist with a difference of approximately 10%, and so the<br>
birefringence of the optical fiber can be measured in the state of being wound around a<br>
bobbin. On the other hand, in cases in which the twist amount exceeds 1 rad/m, and the<br>
twist amounts are different for each optical fiber, the relation between the measured<br>
birefringence and the PMD of the optical fiber placed in the free state is weakened, and the<br>
PMD cannot be accurately measured.<br>
It is preferable that the optical fiber of this invention display, either on the optical<br>
fiber itself or on the bobbin on which it is wound, the PMD value measured using the<br>
above-described PMD measurement method of this invention or the upper limit thereof. It<br>
is preferable that the displayed contents be, for example, "PMD 0.01 to 0.05 ps/ 4km ",<br>
"PMD 0.1 ps/Jkm or less", or similar. Display may be accomplished by affixing a label on<br>
which are printed the display contents, by attaching a tag with the display, or similar. The<br>
PMD value or upper limit may also be printed on an explanatory document listing the<br>
performance of the optical fiber, and this document may be packed or packaged with the<br>
optical fiber wound on the bobbin.<br>
Optical fibers of various lengths, wound around a bobbin of diameter 300 mm under<br>
a tension of 40 g, were in this state subjected to birefringence measurements over a 1300 m<br>
interval from the outermost periphery. Then, this 1300 m was placed in the free state, and<br>
both the birefringence and the PMD were measured ten times each. Vibrations were<br>
applied to the optical fibers upon each measurement (as described in IEC 60793-1-48,<br>
Annex E).<br><br>
The results of comparison of the birefringence in the state of being wrapped around<br>
a bobbin, and the PMD of the optical fiber placed in the free state, appear in FIG. 19. In<br>
FIG. 19, the PMD measurement results are averages often measurements. From FIG. 19 it<br>
is seen that by measuring the birefringence in the state of being wound around a bobbin, the<br>
PMD of the optical fiber placed in the free state can be measured.<br>
FIG. 20 shows the results of comparison of the birefringence of an optical fiber<br>
placed in the free state, and the PMD of the optical fiber placed in the free state. The points<br>
in FIG. 20 are averages often measurement results for each measurement; error bars<br>
indicate the standard deviation. From FIG. 20, by measuring the birefringence when placed<br>
in the free state, the PMD of the optical fiber placed in the free state can be measured. It is<br>
seen that the standard deviation of birefringence measurements is extremely small<br>
compared with the standard deviation of PMD measurements. Hence it is seen that the<br>
PMD measurement method of this invention has extremely good measurement<br>
reproducibility.<br>
FIG. 21 shows the results of comparison of birefringence when in the state of being<br>
wound around a bobbin, and the birefringence of the optical fiber placed in the free state.<br>
From FIG. 21 it is seen that even in the state of being wound around a bobbin, the state of<br>
birefringence is unchanged from the case of being placed in the free state, so that this<br>
method is suitable for measurement of optical fiber wound around a bobbin. The measured<br>
values of the birefringence are equal for the state of being wound around a bobbin and for<br>
the free state because no torsion occurs when winding around the bobbin, or, the effect on<br>
the birefringence due to the bobbin bending radius and lateral pressure is very small.<br><br>
