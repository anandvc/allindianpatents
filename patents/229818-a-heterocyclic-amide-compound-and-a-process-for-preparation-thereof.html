				<td>DPP-IV inhibitors<br>
The present invention relates to a novel class of dipeptidyl peptidase inhibitors, including pharmaceutically acceptable salts and prodrugs thereof, which are useful as therapeutic compounds, particularly in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus, often referred to as non-insulin dependent diabetes meKtus (NIDDM), and of conditions that are often associated with this disease, such as obesity and lipid disorders. The invention also relates to a process for the preparation of such inhibitors.<br>
Diabetes refers to a disease process derived from multiple causative factors and characterized by elevated levels of plasma glucose or hyperglycemia in the fasting state or after administration of glucose during an oral glucose tolerance test Persistent or uncontrolled hyperglycemia is associated with increased and premature morbidity and mortality. Often abnormal glucose homeostasis is associated both directly and indirectly with alterations of the lipki, Kpoprotein and apolipoprotetn metabolism and other metabolic and hemodynamic disease. Therefore patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus are at an increased risk of macrovascular and microvascular complications, including coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, nephropathy, neuropathy, and retfnopathy. Therefore, therapeutical control of glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism and hypertension are critically important in the clinical management and treatment of diabetes mellitus.<br>
There are two generally recognized forms of diabetes. In Type 1, or insulin-dependent, diabetes mellitus (IDDM), patients produce little or no insulin, which is the hormone regulating glucose utilization. In Type 2, or noninsulin dependent, diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), patients often have plasma insulin levels that are the same or elevated compared to nondiabetic subjects. These patients develop a resistance to the insulin stimulating effect on glucose and lipid metabolism in the main insulin-sensitive tissues, namely the muscle, liver and adipose tissues. Further, the plasma insulin levels, while elevated, are insufficient to overcome the pronounced insulin resistance.<br>
Insulin resistance is not primarily due to a diminished number of insulin receptors but to<br><br>
a post-insulin receptor binding defect that is not yet understood. This resistance to insulin responsiveness results in insufficient insulin activation of glucose uptake, oxidation and storage in muscle, and inadequate insulin repression of lipolysis in adipose tissue and of glucose production and secretion in the liver.<br>
The available treatments for Type 2 diabetes, which have not changed substantially in many years, have recognized limitations. While physical exercise and reductions in dietary intake of calories will dramatically improve the diabetic condition, compliance with this treatment is very poor because of well-entrenched sedentary lifestyles and excess food consumption, especially of foods containing high amounts of saturated fat. Increasing the plasma level of insulin by administration of sutfonylureas (e.g., tolbutamide and glipizide) or meglitinide, which stimulate the pancreatic p-cells to secrete more insulin, and/or by injection of insulin when sulfbnylureas or meglitinide become ineffective, can result in insulin concentrations high enough to stimulate the very insulin-resistant tissues. However, dangerously low levels of plasma glucose can result from administration of insulin or insulin secretagogues (sulfonylureas or meglitinide). and an increased level of insulin resistance, due to the even higher plasma insulin levels, can occur. The biguanktes increase insulin sensitivity resulting in some correction of hyperglycemia. However, the two biguarmtes, phenfbrmin and metfonmin, can induce lactic acklosis and nausea/tfiarrhoea. Metfonmin has fewer side effects than phenformin and is often prescribed for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes.<br>
The glitazones (/.a, 5-benzytthiazo6dine-2,4-dk&gt;nes) are a recently described class of compounds with potential for ameliorating many symptoms of Type 2 diabetes. These agents substantially increase insulin sensitivity in muscle, liver and adipose tissue in several animal models of Type 2 diabetes, resulting in partial or complete correction of the elevated plasma levels of glucose without occurrence of hypoglycemia. The glitazones that are currently marketed are agonists of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR), primarily the PPAR-gamma subtype. PPAR-gamma agonism is generally believed to be responsible for the improved insulin sensitization that is observed with the glitazones. Newer PPAR agonists that are being tested for treatment of Type 2 diabetes are agonists of the alpha, gamma or delta subtype, or a combination of these, and in many cases are chemically different from the glitazones (/.Â©., they are not thiazolidinediones). Serious side effects (e.g., liver toxicity) have occurred with some of the glitazones, such as troglitazone.<br><br>
Additional methods of treating the disease are still under investigation. New biochemical approaches that have been recently introduced or are still under development include treatment with alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (e.g., acarbose) and protein tyrosine phosphatase-IB (PTP-1B) inhibitors.<br>
Compounds that are inhibitors of the dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) enzyme are also under investigation as drugs that may be useful in the treatment of diabetes, and particularly Type 2 diabetes. See for example WO-A-97/40832, WO-A-98/19998, WO-A-03/180 and WOA-03/181. The usefulness of DPP-IV inhibitors in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes is based on the fact that DPP-IV in vivo readily inactivates glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP). GLP-1 and GIP are incretins and are produced when food is consumed. The incretins stimulate production of insulin. Inhibition of DPP-IV leads to decreased inactivation of the incretins, and this in turn results in increased effectiveness of the incretins in stimulating production of insulin by the pancreas. DPP-IV inhibition therefore results in an increased level of serum insulin. Advantageously, since the incretins are produced by the body only when food is consumed. DPP-IV inhibition is not expected to increase the level of insulin at inappropriate times, such as between meals, which can lead to excessively low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). Inhtortion of DPP-IV is therefore expected to increase insulin without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia, which is a dangerous side effect associated with the use of insulin secretagogues.<br>
DPP-IV inhibitors may also have other therapeutic utilities, as discussed elsewhere in this application. DPP-IV inhibitors have not been studied extensively to date, especially for utilities other than diabetes. New compounds are needed so that improved DPP-IV inhibitors can be found for the treatment of diabetes and potentially other disease and conditions.<br>
Thus, the object of the present invention is to provide a new class of DPP-IV inhibitors which may be effective in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes and other DPP-IV modulated diseases.<br>

Furthermore, the present invention provides prodrug compounds of the compounds of the invention as described above.<br>
"Prodrug compound" means a derivative that is converted into a compound according to the present invention by a reaction with an enzyme, gastric acid or the like under a physiological condition in the living body, e.g. by oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis or the like, each of which is carried out enzymatically. Examples of the prodrug are compounds, wherein the amino group in a compound of the present invention is acylated, alkylated or phosphorylated to form, e.g., eicosanoylamino, alanylammo, pivaloyloxymethylamino or wherein the hydroxyl group is acylated, alkylated, phosphorylated or converted into the borate, e.g. acetybxy, palmitoyloxy, pivaloybxy, succinytoxy, fumaryloxy, alanyloxy or wherein the carboxyl group is esterified or amidated. These compounds can be produced from compounds of the present invention according to well-known methods.<br>
Metabolites of compounds of formula (I) or (la) are also within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Where tautomerism, like e.g. keto-enol tautomerism, of compounds of general formula (I) or (la) or their prodrugs may occur, the individual forms, like e.g. the keto and enol form, are claimed separately and together as mixtures in any ratio. Same applies for stereoisomers, like e.g. enantiomers, cis/trans isomers, conformers and the like. If desired, isomers can be separated by methods well known in the art, e.g. by liquid chromatography. Same applies for enantfomers by using e.g. chiral stationary phases. Additionally, enantiomers may be isolated by converting them into diastereomers, i.e. coupling with an enantiomerically pure auxiliary compound, subsequent separation of the resulting diastereomers and cleavage of the auxiliary residue. Alternatively, any enantiomer of a compound of formula (I) or (la) may be obtained from stereoselective synthesis using optically pure starting materials.<br>
In case the compounds according to formula (I) or (la) contain one or more acidic or basic groups, the invention also comprises their corresponding pharmaceutically or toxicologically acceptable salts, in particular their pharmaceutically utilizable salts.<br><br>
Thus, the compounds of the formula (I) or (la) which contain acidic groups can be present on these groups and can be used according to the invention, for example, as alkali metal salts, alkaline earth metal salts or as ammonium salts. More precise examples of such salts include sodium salts, potassium salts, calcium salts, magnesium salts or salts with ammonia or organic amines such as, for example, ethylamine, ethanolamine, triethanolamine or amino acids. Compounds of the formula (I) or (la) which contain one or more basic groups, i.e. groups which can be protonated, can be present and can be used according to the invention in the form of their addition salts with inorganic or organic acids. Examples for suitable acids include hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric add, methanesulfonic add, p-toluenesutfonic add, naphthalenedisulfonic adds, oxalic add, acetic add, tartaric add, lactic acid, salicylic add, benzoic acid, formic add, propionic add, pivalic add, diethylacetic add, malonic add, sucdnic add, pimelic add, fumaric add, maleic add, malic add, sulfaminic add, phenylpropionic add, gluconic add, ascorbic add, tsonicotinic add, titric acid, adipic acid, and other adds known to the person skilled in the art If the compounds of the formula (I) or (la) simultaneously contain addic and basic groups in the molecule, the invention also indudes, in addition to the salt forms mentioned, inner salts or betaines (zwitterions). The respective salts according to the formula (I) or (la) can be obtained by customary methods which are known to the person skilled in the art like, for example by contacting these with an organic or inorganic acid or base in a solvent or dispersant, or by anion exchange or cation exchange with other salts. The present invention also includes all salts of the compounds of the formula (I) or (la) which, owing to low physiological compatibility, are not directly suitable for use in Pharmaceuticals but which can be used, for example, as intermediates for chemical reactions or for the preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
The present invention provides compounds of general formula (I) or (la) or their prodrugs as DPP-IV inhibitors. DPP-IV is a cell surface protein that has been implicated in a wide range of biological functions.

The present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of formula (I) or (la), or a prodrug compound thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as active ingredient together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
"Pharmaceutical composition" means one or more active ingredients, and one or more inert ingredients that make up the carrier, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination, complexation or aggregation of any two or more of the ingredients, or from dissociation of one or more of the ingredients, or from other types of reactions or interactions of one or more of the ingredients. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention encompass any composition made by admixing a compound of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br><br>
A pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may additionally comprise one or more other compounds as active ingredients like one or more additional compounds of formula (I) or (la), or a prodrug compound or other DPP-IV inhibitors. Other active ingredients are disclosed in WOA-03/181 under the paragraph "Combination Therapy" which is herewith incorporated by reference. Accordingly, other active ingredients may be insulin sensitizers; PPAR agonists; biguanides; protein tyrosinephosphatase-IB (PTP-1B) inhibitors; insulin and insulin mimetics; suffonylureas and other insulin secretagogues; a-glucosidase inhibitors; glucagon receptor antagonists; GLP-1, GLP-1 mimetics, and GLP-1 receptor agonists; GIP, GIP mimetics, and GIP receptor agonists; PACAP, PACAP mimetics, and PACAP receptor 3 agonists; cholesterol lowering agents; HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors; sequestrants; nicotinyl alcohol; nicotinic acid or a salt thereof; PPARa agonists; PPARoly dual agonists; inhibitors of cholesterol absorption; acyl CoA : cholesterol acyltransferase inhibitors; anti-oxidants; PPARo agonists; antiobesity compounds; an ileal bile add transporter inhtortor; or anti-inflammatory agents or pharmaceutically acceptable salts of these active compounds.<br>
The term "pharmaceuticaUy acceptable salts'9 refers to salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable norvtoxjc bases or adds, including inorganic bases or acids and organic bases or acids.<br>
The compositions include compositions suitable for oral, rectal, topical, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, and intravenous), ocular (ophthalmic), pulmonary (nasal or buccal inhalation), or nasal administration, although the most suitable route in any given case will depend on the nature and severity of the conditions being treated and on the nature of the active ingredient. They may be conveniently presented in unit dosage form and prepared by any of the methods well-known in the art of pharmacy.<br>
In practical use, the compounds of formula (I) or (la) can be combined as the active ingredient in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration, e.g., oral or parenteral (including intravenous). In preparing the compositions for oral dosage form, any of the<br><br>
usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations, such as, for example, suspensions, elixirs and solutions; or carriers such as starches, sugars, microcrystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of oral solid preparations such as, for example, powders, hard and soft capsules and tablets, with the solid oral preparations being preferred over the liquid preparations.<br>
Because of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. If desired, tablets may be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques. Such compositions and preparations should contain at least 0.1 percent of active compound. The percentage of active compound in these compositions may, of course, be varied and may conveniently be between about 2 percent to about 60 percent of the weight of the unit The amount of active compound in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that an effective dosage will be obtained. The active compounds can also be administered irrtranasaUy as, for example, liquid drops or spray.<br>
The tablets, pills, capsules, and the fike may also contain a binder such as gum tragacanth, acacia, com starch or gelatin; exctpients such as dicaltiurn phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch, aiginic ack); a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, lactose or saccharin. When a dosage unit form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier such as a fatty oil.<br>
Various other materials may be present as coatings or to modify the physical form of the dosage unit. For instance, tablets may be coated with shellac, sugar or both. A syrup or elixir may contain, in addition to the active ingredient, sucrose as a sweetening agent methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and a flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) or (la) may also be administered parenterally. Solutions or suspensions of these active compounds can be prepared in water suitably mixed with a surfactant such as hydroxy-propylcellulose. Dispersions can also be prepared in<br><br>
glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols and mixtures thereof in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.<br>
The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases, the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (e.g., glycerol, propylene glycol and liquid polyethylene glycol), suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils. Any suitable route of administration may be employed for providing a mammal, especially a human, with an effective dose of a compound of the present invention. For example, oral, rectal, topical, parenteral, ocular, pulmonary, nasal, and the like may be employed. Dosage forms include tablets, troches, dispersions, suspensions, solutions, capsules, creams, ointments, aerosols, and the like. Preferably compounds of formula (I) or (la) are administered orally.<br>
The effective dosage of active ingredient employed may vary depending on the particular compound employed, the mode of administration, the condition being treated and the severity of the condition being treated. Such dosage may be ascertained readily by a person skilled in the art<br>
When treating or preventing diabetes mellitus and/or hyperglycemia or hypertriglyceridemia or other diseases for which compounds of Formula I are indicated, generally satisfactory results are obtained when the compounds of the present invention are administered at a daily dosage of from about 0,1 milligram to about 100 milligram per kilogram of animal body weight, preferably given as a single daily dose or in divided doses two to six times a day, or in sustained release form. For most large mammals, the total daily dosage is from about 1.0 milligrams to about 1000 milligrams, preferably from about 1 milligrams to about 50 milligrams. In the case of a 70 kg adult human, the total daily dose will generally be from about 7 milligrams to about 350 milligrams. This dosage regimen may be adjusted to provide the optimal therapeutic response.<br><br>
The compounds of formula (I) of the present invention can be prepared from beta amino acid intermediates such as those of formula (IV) and substituted amine intermediates such as those of formula (III), using standard peptide coupling conditions. The preparation of these intermediates is described in the following schemes.<br>

General procedure for making compounds of the invention<br>
In general, compounds having the formula (I)<br><br>
wherein the variables have the above described meanings, may be prepared using<br>
standard peptide coupling conditions, reagents and protective groups. For example, it<br>
may be possible to use 1-ethyl-3-(3<firnethylaminopro hydrocnonde></firnethylaminopro>
(EDC) in combination with 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) and a base (triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine) or O^-azabenzotriazoH-ylJ-N, N, N\ N-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU) in the presence of a base, in solvents such as methylene chloride or W,A/-dimethylformamide.<br>
Scheme H outlines a procedure for using the amines formed according to Schemes A through G to synthesize compounds that are embodiments of the invention.<br><br><br>
The protective group may be removed with, for example, diethylamine in dichloromethane in the case of 9-ftuorenyÂ»methoxycarbony! or using acidic conditions (such as trifluoroacetic acid in dichloromethane or hydrochloric acid in dioxane) in the case of tert-butoxycarbonyt, as described in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis 3rd ed., Ed. Wiley-VCH, New York; 1999.<br>
For the purification of intermediates or end products, flash chromatography on sil jca gel may be suitable for the free amines whereas the use of preparative HPLC leads to the isolation of the corresponding trifluoroacetic acid or formate salts.<br>

ASSAYS<br>
Inhibition of DPP-IV peptidase activity was monitored with a continuous fluorimetric assay. This assay is based on the cleavage of the substrate Gly-Pro-AMC (Bachem) by DPP-IV, releasing free AMC. The assay is carried out in 96-wetl miorotiterplates. In a total volume of 100 pL, compounds are preincubated with 50 pM DPP-IV employing a buffer containing 10mM Hepes, 150mM NaCI, 0.005% Tween 20 (pH 7.4). The reaction is started by the addition of 16 pM substrate and the fluorescence of liberated AMC is detected for 10 minutes at 25 Â°C with a fluorescence reader (BMG-Fluostar; BMG-Technologies) using an excitation wavelength of 370 nm and an emission wavelength of 450 nm. The final concentration of DMSO is 1 %. The inhibitory potential of the compounds were determined. DPP-IV activity assays were carried out with human and porcine DPP-IV (see below); both enzymes showed comparable activities-include.<br>
Soluble human DPP-IV lacking the transmembrane anchor (Gly31-Pro766) was expressed in a recombinant YEAST-strain as Pre-Pro-alpha-mating fusion. The secreted product (rhuDPP-IV-Gly31-Pro766) was purified from fermentation broth (&gt;90% purity) and used for inhouse screening.<br><br><br><br>
