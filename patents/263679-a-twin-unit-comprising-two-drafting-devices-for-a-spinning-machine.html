BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A twin unit comprising two drafting devices for a spinning machine<br>
The present invention relates to a twin unit comprising two drafting devices for<br>
drafting fibre strands for a spinning machine comprising one housing for both of the<br>
drafting devices which housing is mounted in a detachable way on a machine frame,<br>
each of which drafting device can be driven separately, whereby the drafting devices<br>
are arranged essentially mirror-symmetrical to one another and comprise a number<br>
of driveable bottom rollers, and whereby each bottom roller comprises an area which<br>
drafts the fibre strand.<br>
A spinning machine built in modular design is known in European published patent<br>
application 1422 323. A number of self-supporting spinning units attached to a<br>
machine frame are provided there in machine longitudinal direction, which units serve<br>
the production of yarn. Each spinning unit can, as a module, be simply replaced. In<br>
the case of airjet spinning machines, these spinning units comprise at least one<br>
drafting device, a drive and an airjet aggregate. The drafting device of each individual<br>
spinning position can be separately driven.<br>
In the case of drafting devices of this type which are driven separately, it is standard<br>
practice to support the bottom rollers in an overhung position. The bottom rollers are<br>
hereby supported only on their ends facing the housing, while the area of the bottom<br>
roller which drafts the fibre strand projects upwards from the frame and has there no<br>
further bearing point.<br>
For reasons of efficient use of space it is intended that, in the spinning machine, the<br>
smallest possible gauge, that is the smallest possible distance between each<br>
spinning position, is realized. The spinning units having a complete housing for each<br>
individual drafting device and the overhung supported bottom rollers therein have the<br>
disadvantage in that they set limits to the reduction of the gauge.<br>
The overhung supporting arrangements have the disadvantage in that they require a<br>
very complicated bearing of large dimensions. The shorter the bearing is designed,<br>
the higher the bearing forces are.<br><br>
3<br>
From the German published patent application 39 04 348 it is known that such<br>
drafting devices having overhung supported bottom rollers are designed as twin<br>
units, in which two drafting devices are arranged in a common housing. Both drafting<br>
devices are arranged essentially mirror-symmetric to one another and are driven<br>
separately. Due to the mirror-symmetrical assembly as a twin unit, a little saving of<br>
space can be achieved, but because of the overhung supported bottom rollers, quite<br>
a large installation space is stilt required.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to create a spinning unit in which the space<br>
requirements in longitudinal direction of the spinning machine are reduced, thus<br>
permitting a smaller gauge.<br>
This object has been achieved in that each bottom roller comprises two bearing<br>
points, whereby one bearing point is arranged on each side of the area which drafts<br>
the fibre strand.<br>
Because of the placing of two bearing points essentially at both ends of the bottom<br>
rollers, the bearing forces are reduced and the bearing points can be of smaller<br>
dimensions. The support of the bottom roller on both sides of the area which drafts<br>
the fibre strand avoids a multiplication of the forces mainly occuring due to the<br>
pressure of the assigned top rollers, as such multiplication occurs in the case of the<br>
overhung support. The load is rathermore divided almost evenly between both<br>
bearing points.<br>
Due to the mirror-symmetric arrangement, both bottom rollers, which lie opposite one<br>
another on either side of the plane of symmetry of the twin unit, can be defined as a<br>
bottom roller pair. These bottom roller pairs of both drafting devices of the twin unit<br>
are often only jointly adjusted in their position along the fibre transport direction. It is<br>
then advantageous when the bearing points facing the plane of symmetry comprise a<br>
joint bearing take-up. Design and adjustibility are hereby simplified, and further<br>
installation space can be saved by placing the bearing points accordingly.<br>
Flexibily pressable top rollers are arranged to the bottom rollers of the drafting<br>
device. The top rollers can be supported and pressed in different ways. If it is<br>
necessary that individual top rollers be raised separately, then these top rollers are<br>
advantageously individually supported and pressed. In order to further reduce space<br>
requirements, it can be advantageous to design as many top rollers as so-called twin<br>
4<br>
pressure rollers. The two top rollers of a so-called bottom roller pair are hereby<br>
rotatably supported on a joint stationary axle and pressed by a joint loading<br>
aggregate.<br>
It is in addition advantageous to assign to each drafting device at least one separate<br>
drive motor, which is also arranged in the housing of the twin unit. Thus each drafting<br>
device can be individually controlled and also brought to standstill in a simple way.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
These and further objects, features and advantages of the present invention will<br>
become more readily apparent from the following detailed description thereof when<br>
taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein:<br>
Figure 1 shows a top view of a twin unit comprising two drafting devices, whereby a<br>
number of top rollers have been omitted for reasons of clarity,<br>
Figure 2 shows an intersectional view of the twin unit along the surface ll-ll.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The twin unit 1 according to Figures 1 and 2 comprises two drafting devices 2 in a<br>
common housing 3. The drafting devices 2 are arranged to two adjacent spinning<br>
positions S1 and S2 of a spinning machine and serve in the known way to draft fibre<br>
strands 4 and 5 to the desired degree of fineness.<br>
The housing 3 of the twin unit 1 is releaseably attached to a machine frame 6 which<br>
extends in machine longitudinal direction. Along the spinning machine a number of<br>
twin units 1 having a number of spinning positions S are arranged on the machine<br>
frame 6. The adjacent twin unit 1' of the next spinning position S3 is denoted in<br>
Figure 1. The distance between the spinning positions S1 S2, S3 is identical and is<br>
referred to as the gauge of the spinning machine.<br>
The spinning twist imparted to the drafted fibre strands 4, 5 can take place in a<br>
variety of known ways, for example by means of airjet aggregates 7. The airjet<br>
aggregates 7 can be arranged together with the drafting devices 2 as well as the<br>
withdrawal roller pairs 8 in the housing 3 of the twin unit 1. The twin unit 1 can form in<br>
an advantageous way a complete spinning unit, which, as a compact module, can be<br>
installed and dismantled in the spinning machine in a simple way. <br>
5<br>
The shown drafting devices 2 are designed as four cylinder drafting devices, but<br>
could just as well alternatively be designed as three cylinder drafting devices.<br>
The drafting devices 2 each comprise four bottom rollers 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13, 14, 15,<br>
16, which are arranged one behind the other in fibre transport direction A and which<br>
are driveable at increasing speeds. Top rollers 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 are arranged<br>
respectively to the bottom rollers 9 to 16. For reasons of clarity, the top rollers 19, 20<br>
belonging to the bottom rollers 11, 12,15, 16 are not shown in Figure 1.<br>
The top rollers 17 to 22 are flexibly pressed against the bottom rollers 9 to 16 and are<br>
thus taken along. In order to improve the quality of the drafted fibre strands 4, 5,<br>
guiding belts 23, 24 can loop the bottom rollers 11,15 and the top rollers 19 in the<br>
known way.<br>
The fibre strands 4, 5 are fed downstream of the front roller pairs 25 of the drafting<br>
devices 2 to the twist devices, which are designed as airjets aggregates 7 in the<br>
shown embodiment. The forming threads 26, 27 are fed by the withdrawal roller<br>
pairs 8 in withdrawal direction B to winding devices (not shown) of the spinning<br>
machine. The withdrawal roller pairs 8 also comprise driven bottom rollers 28, 29,<br>
and top rollers 30 which are flexibly pressed against the bottom rollers 30, whereby<br>
the top rollers 30 belonging to the bottom rollers 28, 29 are again not shown in Figure<br>
1.<br>
The bottom rollers 9 to 12 and 28 of the spinning position S1 are driven by the motors<br>
31, 32 in the way denoted by the dot-dash line, which are also advantageously<br>
applied to the housing 3. The bottom rollers 13 to 16 and 29 of the second spinning<br>
position S2 of the twin unit 1 are driven in the same way by two motors (not shown).<br>
The power transmission can take place via drive gears 33 in the form of toothed belt<br>
pulleys.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to support the bottom rollers 9 to 16 and 28, <br>
29 in such a way that, in comparison to the above mentioned prior art, a reduction in<br>
the amount of space required is achieved. The gauge of the spinning machine is to<br>
be reduced, so that a spinning machine with the same number of spinning positions<br>
S1, S2... has a shorter overall length, and that with the same overall length, a larger<br>
number of spinning positions S1 S2,... can be installed.<br><br>
6<br>
Because each bottom roller 9 to 16 and 28, 29 comprises two bearing points 34 and<br>
35, one of which is arranged on either side of the area which guides the fibre strand<br>
4, 5, a reduction in the bearing forces is achieved, which permits a radical reduction<br>
of the bearing points 34. Despite the additional necessary installation space for the<br>
bearing points 35, in contrast to prior art, installation space can be reduced overall,<br>
as the bearing point 34 alone present in the overhung bearing arrangement requires<br>
more installation space in any case than the sum of the downsized bearing points 34<br>
and the bearing points 35 together.<br>
The bearing points 34 and 35 can be advantageously designed as roller bearings<br>
and are taken up in bearing take-ups 36, 37, 38 and affixed to the housing 3 by<br>
means of a fastening means 39, for example screws, it can be provided that the<br>
bearing take-ups 36, 37, 38 are adjustable in fibre transport direction A, so that the<br>
distances between the bottom rollers 9 to 12 and 13 to 16 can be adjusted.<br>
It is advantageous to design the drafting devices 2 of both spinning positions S1 and<br>
S2 of the twin unit 1 essentially mirror-symmetrical to one another. The plane of<br>
symmetry is denoted in Figure 1 by a dot-dash line 40. A mirror-symmetrical placing<br>
of the components of the drafting devices 2 permits a further reduction of the<br>
installation space and thus also of the gauge.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention it can be provided that fibre strands 4 and<br>
5 made of identical material are processed on adjacent spinning positionsS1 and S2.<br>
The bottom rollers 8 to 12, and 13 to 16 are so adjusted, that the axes of two bottom<br>
rollers 9 to 16 lying opposite one another on either side of the plane of symmetry 40,<br>
for example the bottom rollers 11 and 15, are aligned exactly with one another. The<br>
bottom rollers 11 and 15 thus form a bottom roller pair in a line. In this case it is<br>
advantageous to take up the bearing points 35 facing the plane of symmetry 40 of<br>
the twin unit 1 in a joint bearing take-up 38. This ensures that the respective bottom<br>
rollers 9 to 16 forming a bottom roller pair are jointly adjusted and are disposed in<br>
exact alignment with each other. If all the bearing points 35 are taken up by joint<br>
bearing take-ups 38, even more installation space can be saved by means of skilled<br>
design of the bearing take-ups 38.<br>
The bottom rollers 9 to 16 and 28, 29 disposed opposite one another at the plane of<br>
symmetry 40 should on no account be connected with one another inside the joint<br><br>
7<br>
bearing take-ups 38, as then none of the spinning positions S1, S2 can be<br>
autonomously driven or individually stopped in the case of an end break.<br>
If individual bottom roller pairs of the bottom rollers 9 to 16 and 28, 29 are taken up<br>
by joint bearing take-ups 38, it can be advantageous when the respective top rollers<br>
17 to 22 and 30 are designed as twin pressure rollers 41. A joint axle 42, 43, 44 is<br>
then assigned respectively to two top rollers 17 to 22 and 30 disposed opposite one<br>
another at the plane of symmetry 40, which axles 42, 43, 44 can also be supported<br>
by a joint loading aggregate 45.<br>
For example, the bottom rollers 10 and 14 can form, together with a joint bearing<br>
take-up 38, a so-called bottom roller pair, to which the top rollers 18 and 22 in the<br>
form of a twin pressure roller 41 are assigned. The top rollers 18 and 22 are<br>
rotatably supported on a joint stationary axle 43, whereby the axle 43 is held by the<br>
loading aggregate 45.<br>
For specific procedural steps, in particular in the case of re-starting of a temporarily<br>
stopped spinning postion S1 after an interruption, it may be necessary that for<br>
example the top roller 20 and 30 of the front roller pair 25 and of the withdrawal roller<br>
pair 8 respectively have to be opened individually. In such a case it is advantageous<br>
to support these top rollers 20, 30 individually and to press them by means of<br>
separate loading devices 46, 47. Thus a disruption of the spinning process at the<br>
adjacent spinning position S2 is avoided if the upper rollers 20, 30 of the spinning<br>
station S1 have to be opened.<br><br>
