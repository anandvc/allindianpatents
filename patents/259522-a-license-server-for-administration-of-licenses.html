Description<br>
Method and arrangement for managing licenses<br>
The invention relates to a method for managing licenses in<br>
accordance with the precharacterizing part of patent claim 1<br>
and to an arrangement for managing licenses in accordance with<br>
the precharacterizing part of patent claim 11.<br>
With technical equipment and arrangements, it is frequently the<br>
case that use of a resource requires a license for use. Thus,<br>
by way of example, the purchase of a data storage medium with a<br>
computer program does not automatically have the associated<br>
"authorization" to actually use this computer program. Another<br>
common example of the use of licenses are modern communication<br>
systems, which the manufacturer equips with a particular number<br>
of resources, for example interfaces, channels, services etc.<br>
In this case, a number of licenses which is purchased by a user<br>
determines the scope of permitted use of the resources provided<br>
by the manufacturer in advance. In this context, the term<br>
"resource" has a very broad sense within the scope of this<br>
patent application and denotes any technical facility, service,<br>
function, computer program or the like whose use requires use<br>
authorization, that is to say a license.<br>
Ideally, a manufacturer provides its customers with precisely<br>
as many resources and an identical number of licenses as the<br>
customer actually requires. In the example of communication<br>
installations, this would mean that a customer operating 20<br>
extensions would also be supplied with a communication<br>
installation having 20 subscriber interfaces and naturally also<br>
with a license for operating the 2 0 subscriber interfaces (and<br>
hence for the use of 20 channels) . In this example, however,<br>
this has the drawback that as the customer's needs increase it<br>
is necessary to retrofit both individual resources (in this<br>
case: physical subscriber interfaces) and the use licenses<br>
required for operation. This is disadvantageous both from a<br><br>
200618565	- 2 -<br>
logistical point of view and from a. technical point of view.<br>
Therefore, technical facilities, that is to say including the<br>
communication installations under consideration here, are often<br>
"over proportioned" in terms of their resources, i.e. twenty-<br>
four or thirty resources (subscriber lines) are supplied<br>
instead of the originally required twenty resources, for<br>
example, but only twenty licenses. Extending the<br>
telecommunication installation then merely requires the<br>
purchase of further licenses and the associated "enabling" of<br>
the additional resources already provided in advance. Another<br>
example are computer programs which are sold in a full version<br>
on a data storage medium or can even be loaded from the<br>
Internet but whose use requires the purchase of what is known<br>
as an "enable code" (installation key) and hence the purchase<br>
of a license. Depending on the enable code (type of license), a<br>
greater or lesser scope of functions of the computer program is<br>
enabled for the customer in this case. This means that in this<br>
example too the resources (in this case: functions of the<br>
computer program) are with the customer from the outset<br>
(provided in advance) but cannot be used until a license is<br>
granted. In brief, the use of licenses is an instrument for<br>
releasing or blocking services, that is to say resources, as<br>
required.<br>
As an example of a license-based use scenario, a communication<br>
network having three communication nodes will now be assumed,<br>
with each communication node needing to have a license to use<br>
each channel (that is to say for each telephone call, for<br>
example) . If thirty terminals are connected to each of the<br>
three communication installations, thirty licenses can be<br>
allocated for each communication installation, for example.<br>
This would have the advantage that sufficient licenses for the<br>
resources (in this case: channels) are always available, and in<br>
each communication installation, even if all the subscribers<br>
are making telephone calls at the same time, in other words:<br>
are using their resources. However, such a setup would have the<br>
drawback for the operator of the communication network that he<br><br>
200618565	- 3 -<br>
would need to purchase ninety licenses, even though it is<br>
extremely unlikely that all ninety subscribers would actually<br>
be making telephone calls at the same time and hence is highly<br>
likely that it is not actually necessary to purchase such a<br>
large number of licenses. To solve the problem, it is naturally<br>
possible to reduce the number of licenses for each<br>
communication installation, for example to halve it. However,<br>
the situation may then arise that in a first of the<br>
communication systems, for example, the number of granted<br>
licenses is not sufficient while another of the communication<br>
systems has free, unused licenses. The result of this would be<br>
that a function is not possible at a first location on account<br>
of "a lack of licenses", even though sufficient licenses are<br>
available in total.<br>
To solve this "distribution problem", it is known practice to<br>
use licenses flexibly always precisely at the point at which<br>
they are currently needed; reference is also made to a<br>
"floating licenses" concept or else to "central licensing".<br>
This is generally done by using a central entity, what is known<br>
as a "licensing server", which holds all the licenses available<br>
(releasable) for the network or the arrangement. As soon as a<br>
resource needs to be used (in the example above, this would be:<br>
as soon as a channel needs to be used) , this resource or the<br>
technical facility providing this resource (in this case:<br>
communication installation) sets up a connection to the license<br>
server and obtains a free license therefrom for the duration of<br>
use. As soon as the resource is no longer being used, this<br>
license is released again by fresh data interchange with the<br>
license server, so that this license is available to the other<br>
resources again. This practice has the advantage that not every<br>
communication installation in the network needs to hold a<br>
maximum number of licenses for safety reasons, that is to say<br>
for the case of an extraordinarily high utilization level, but<br>
rather the available licenses can be used flexibly for various<br>
resources or at various locations. However, the drawback of the<br>
outlined method is that the network load in a network rises as<br><br>
200618565	- 4 -<br>
a result of the constant allocation and re-release of licenses.<br>
In addition, if a central license server has a fault or is<br>
unattainable, the functionality of the entire network can be<br>
severely restricted.<br>
It is therefore an object of	the present invention to make the<br>
attribution of licenses to	resources more flexible and to<br>
improve the dependability	of arrangements with central<br>
licensing.<br>
The object is achieved by a method in accordance with patent<br>
claim 1 and by an arrangement in accordance with patent claim<br>
11.<br>
The solution to the problem provides a method for managing<br>
licenses, where for the use of a resource a license is<br>
attributed to this resource, and where this license is released<br>
again following use of the resource. In this case, a first<br>
central entity registers the number of releasable licenses, a<br>
second entity attributes the resource to be used a releasable<br>
license for use which is registered in said second entity,<br>
and/or a license attributed to the resource by this second<br>
entity is registered as releasable again in the second entity<br>
when it is not being used. In a synchronization step the<br>
difference between the number of licenses allocated for use<br>
since a previous synchronization step and the licenses released<br>
again in this time is repeatedly reported from the second<br>
entity to the first entity, this difference being taken as a<br>
basis for reducing the number of releasable licenses registered<br>
in the first entity, and conversely the resultant number of<br>
releasable licenses is reported from the first entity to the<br>
second entity and is registered there as the number of<br>
releasable licenses. This method ensures that following the<br>
conclusion of the synchronization step the second entity has<br>
available the releasable licenses currently available in an<br>
arrangement, and when there are a plurality of second entities,<br>
each of these second entities has available the releasable<br><br>
200618565	- 5 -<br>
licenses to the full extent. As a result, it is possible for<br>
each second entity to access all releasable licenses even in<br>
the cases in which connection to the first entity (central<br>
entity) is not possible or is possible only to a restricted<br>
degree.<br>
The solution to the problem also provides an arrangement for<br>
managing licenses, having a plurality of resources, where for<br>
the use of a resource said resource is respectively attributed<br>
a license for the duration of its use. In this case, means are<br>
provided in order to attribute one of the licenses from a stock<br>
of releasable licenses to a resource which is to be used and,<br>
following use of the resource, to reattribute the license which<br>
is no longer needed to the stock. The arrangement is provided<br>
with a first entity having a first database for registering the<br>
releasable licenses. In addition, the arrangement is provided<br>
with a plurality of second entities having second databases for<br>
managing the releasable licenses, the second entities being set<br>
up to perform a synchronization step with the first entity, and<br>
the second entities being set up to allocate licenses to the<br>
resources and to re-release licenses which are no longer being<br>
used. In this case, the first entity and the second entities<br>
are set such that upon performance of a synchronization step<br>
between the first entity and one of the second entities, in a<br>
respective first substep the second entity reports to the first<br>
entity at least the difference between the number of licenses<br>
allocated since the last synchronization and the number of<br>
licenses re-released since the last synchronization. The<br>
entities are also set up such that in a second substep of the<br>
synchronization the central entity reduces or increases the<br>
number of releasable licenses registered there by the reported<br>
difference, and in a third substep the central entity transmits<br>
the number of releasable licenses which has been freshly<br>
ascertained in this manner to the second entity, the second<br>
entity being set such that this freshly ascertained number of<br>
releasable licenses in the second entity replaces the number of<br>
releasable licenses which was registered there previously. Such<br><br>
200618565	- 6 -<br>
an arrangement advantageously ensures that the reaction time<br>
between the application for a license and the allotment of a<br>
license to a resource is reduced because it is not necessary to<br>
set up a connection to a central license server, that is to say<br>
to the first entity, for each license allocation. Furthermore,<br>
such an arrangement has the releasable licenses available for<br>
all second entities simultaneously, the means for the<br>
synchronization step achieving the aim that the databases in<br>
the second entities are respectively brought into line with the<br>
first entity. In such an arrangement, it is furthermore<br>
possible for a large number of resources to be provided with<br>
licenses in the case of "load peaks" even if there are now only<br>
a few releasable licenses free in the overall arrangement. This<br>
avoids the need for the overall arrangement to hold an<br>
unnecessarily large number of releasable licenses for safety<br>
reasons.<br>
Advantageous refinements of the inventive method are specified<br>
in the dependent patent claims. The features and advantages<br>
shown therein can also be applied analogously to the inventive<br>
arrangement.<br>
If the synchronization step is repeatedly performed in<br>
succession with each of the second entities, it is guaranteed,<br>
on statistical average, that the enableable licenses<br>
respectively registered in the second entities correspond to<br>
the number of releasable licenses registered in the first<br>
entity. If no releasable licenses are attributed to the<br>
resources or licenses are returned by the resources in the mean<br>
time, after a dual synchronization cycle the value stored in<br>
each second entity for the releasable licenses even corresponds<br>
precisely to the relevant value in the first entity. This means<br>
that it is guaranteed that for an overall arrangement<br>
essentially only the number of licenses required on statistical<br>
average needs to be held.<br><br>
200618565	- 7 -<br>
If the resource to be used, before it is used or at the start<br>
of its use, prompts allotment of a license by a second entity<br>
to which this resource is attributed, and if, in this case, the<br>
second entity, in cases in which at least one enableable<br>
license is registered in a second entity, allots this license<br>
to the resource and this license is blocked for further<br>
resources until this license is released again by the resource<br>
using it, then it is guaranteed that a second entity attributes<br>
each releasable license only to a single one of the resources<br>
at the same time, which prevents multiple allocation of a<br>
releasable license within one and the same second entity.<br>
It is advantageous if various types of resources are defined,<br>
in which case various license types are defined for the various<br>
resource types and these licenses of various type are managed<br>
by the first entity and by the second entities, in each case<br>
separately from one another. This means that different<br>
resources with different licenses can be linked to one another<br>
via the same first and second entities.<br>
It is advantageous if the synchronization step is repeatedly<br>
performed in a prescribed time frame. The prescribed time frame<br>
can therefore influence the network loading on a network<br>
directly, with shorter synchronization steps shortening the<br>
period in which licenses can be released beyond the actual<br>
number of releasable licenses, but also resulting in a higher<br>
network loading through the synchronization data. In this case,<br>
it is advantageous if, in cases in which the number of<br>
registered releasable licenses in the first entity and/or in at<br>
least one of the second entities is below a predefined<br>
threshold value, the synchronization step is performed more<br>
frequently than prescribed in the time frame. This ensures that<br>
re-released licenses are reported back in the shortest time<br>
possible not only to that second entity to which this license<br>
has been returned but also in real time to the first entity and<br>
hence are reported to the subsequently synchronized second<br>
entities again.<br><br>
200618565	- 8 -<br>
A uniform utilization level for the second entities can be<br>
achieved by virtue of each resource being attributed to<br>
precisely one of the second entities. In this case, additional<br>
substitute attributions can advantageously be made which apply<br>
to the situation in which one or more of the second entities<br>
fail.<br>
The first entity and/or the second entities can be preset such<br>
that for a predefined period the number of licenses in use can<br>
exceed the number of registered releasable licenses. This makes<br>
such an arrangement "overload tolerant" avoiding malfunctions<br>
as a result of unusable resources in the event of load peaks.<br>
If this predefined period is the period up to conclusion of the<br>
next synchronization step, inputting a single time constant,<br>
namely the synchronization interval, allows good control of the<br>
overload response of an arrangement based on the invention.<br>
What are known as "fuzzy-logic" strategies may advantageously<br>
be used to control the license volume in this case.<br>
Exemplary embodiments of the inventive method	are explained<br>
below with reference to the drawings. These are	simultaneously<br>
used to explain an exemplary embodiment of	the inventive<br>
arrangement.<br>
In the drawings:<br>
figure 1 shows an arrangement comprising a plurality of<br>
database nodes, a plurality of application nodes and<br>
a plurality of client systems with resources,<br>
figure 2 shows the distribution of releasable and allocated<br>
licenses during various load states,<br>
figure 3 shows a schematic illustration of a data transfer<br>
during a synchronization step,<br><br>
200618565	- 9 -<br>
figure 4 shows the addition of reieasable licenses to the<br>
arrangement,<br>
figure 5 shows the situation in the event of undersupply with<br>
reieasable licenses,<br>
figure 6 shows a special case with just one application node,<br>
and<br>
figure 7 shows a scenario with failure of an application node.<br>
Figure 1 schematically shows an arrangement comprising a<br>
network NW (communication network, data network, intranet,<br>
Internet or the like) with database nodes DBNl, DBN2, DBN3,<br>
with application nodes A, B, C, with client systems CLl, CL2<br>
and with resources RlA, RIB, R2A, R2B. The schematically shown<br>
components in this instance constitute what is known as a<br>
"distributed arrangement" (distributed system), with the<br>
individual components being able to be arranged with free<br>
"mobility", that is to say at any location, in the network NW.<br>
This applies particularly to the database nodes DBNl, DBN2,<br>
DBN3, which logically form a single database but for reasons of<br>
load distribution and for reasons of redundancy (failsafety)<br>
are physically distributed over various hardware units.<br>
Equally, although figure 1 shows the resources RlA, RIB as<br>
belonging to the client system CLl - in line with the resources<br>
R2A, R2B for the client system CL2 - the resources under<br>
consideration here may likewise be arranged on various and also<br>
totally different hardware platforms.<br>
The resources RlA, RlB, R2A, R2B are functions ("services")<br>
which can be used within the context of the distributed system,<br>
which is also known as SOA (Service Orientated Architecture),<br>
in clients or by clients. In the present exemplary embodiment,<br>
these are communication channels which can be used in a<br>
telephony arrangement; it goes without saying that any other<br>
service, an arbitrary functionality or an appliance may also be<br><br>
200618565	- 10 -<br>
considered as a "resource". For each telephone call which he<br>
wishes to make, a subscriber needs to use such a channel for<br>
transmitting his call. Such a communication channel is used<br>
using what is known as a protocol stack (e.g. what is known as<br>
an "SIP stack" - for Session Initiation Protocol). However,<br>
such a protocol stack can only be used if the license holder<br>
for this protocol stack grants authorization to do so, in other<br>
words: grants a license for use. In the present exemplary<br>
embodiment, it is first of all assumed that the operator of the<br>
arrangement shown has purchased a license for the simultaneous<br>
operation of 2 0 resources RlA, RlB, R2A, R2B. In this case, the<br>
resources RlA, RIB, R2A, R2B in figure 1 are shown as<br>
representative of a very much larger number of resources of the<br>
same type (in this case: protocol stacks).<br>
For the discussion of the method based on the invention or the<br>
arrangement based on the invention, it is of no significance in<br>
or by which of the client systems CLl, CL2 one of the resources<br>
RlA, RIB, R2A, R2B is to be used. For this reason, the<br>
resources RlA, RIB, R2A, R2B are not shown further in the<br>
figures which follow. The text below therefore always uses the<br>
term "resource" in a general sense.<br>
The use of a resource requires - as already explained - a<br>
respective license, a license only ever being able to be<br>
allotted to a particular number (in this case, precisely 1) of<br>
using resources at the same time. That is to say that before a<br>
resource is used or at the start of use of a resource, this<br>
resource needs to be attributed one license from a stock of<br>
available ("releasable") licenses and said license should be<br>
made available to the "license pool" again following conclusion<br>
of the use of the resource. In this case, each resource is<br>
attributed to one of the application nodes A, B, C. Each<br>
resource which is to be used obtains the license required for<br>
use from the associated one of the application nodes A, B, C<br>
for the period of use. In this case, it is either possible for<br>
the resource to request the license from the application node<br><br>
200618565	- 11 -<br>
A, B, C automatically or else for the process of license<br>
allotment to be performed by an external entity (not shown).<br>
Within the application nodes A, B, C, the licenses are<br>
respectively managed by a special computer program, known as<br>
the "resource broker". The central instrument for managing the<br>
licenses, will be referred to below as the "resource store" RS;<br>
this first, central entity "resource store" RS can - as already<br>
described - be formed by a multiplicity of database nodes DBNl,<br>
DBN2, DBN3. The resource store RS is that central point at<br>
which licenses for the use of the resources can be added to or<br>
removed ("deleted") from the entire communication arrangement.<br>
Figures 1A to 7 now schematically show only the application<br>
nodes A, B, C with the number of releasable and allocated<br>
licenses "buffer stored" there and also (respectively on the<br>
right hand side of the figure) the resource store RS with the<br>
licenses registered there.<br>
In one alternative embodiment, the resources are not located on<br>
the client systems CLl, CL2 but rather at other nodes, for<br>
example directly at the application nodes A, B, C. It goes<br>
without saying that in these cases it is not necessary to<br>
access the network NW in order to obtain or release a license,<br>
provided that the relevant resource is installed at the same<br>
application node A, B, C at which the resource brokes<br>
associated with this resource is arranged.<br>
In the text below, it is assumed that 20 releasable licenses<br>
have been set in the resource store. For the sake of<br>
simplicity, it is assumed that all resources under<br>
consideration require licenses of the same type; otherwise,<br>
each resource type or each associated different license type<br>
would need to be considered separately. In this regard, the<br>
right-hand part of figure 2A schematically shows the resource<br>
store RS, the statement "total = 20" indicating that 2 0<br>
licenses are being managed in total. In addition, the statement<br>
"available = 20" indicates that of the 20 licenses managed<br><br>
200618565	- 12 -<br>
there are 2 0 which can be released,, that is to say that at<br>
first there are no licenses being used.<br>
The resource brokers for the application nodes A, B, C are<br>
shown in the left-hand part of figure 2A. These perform a<br>
respective synchronization step with the resource store RS at<br>
stipulated, configurable intervals of time. In addition, a<br>
synchronization step of this type is also performed when each<br>
resource broker is engaged afresh, the resource brokers<br>
respectively setting up a connection to the resource store RS.<br>
In this synchronization step, each resource broker reads the<br>
number of releasable licenses (in this case initially:<br>
"available = 20") from the resource store RS and stores this<br>
statement. These statements "20" are respectively shown in the<br>
left-hand part of figure 2A.<br>
The text below considers a period of time in which no further<br>
synchronization step takes place. In this period of time,<br>
various resources request licenses from their respective<br>
associated resource brokers. It goes without saying that if a<br>
resource broker fails or if the relevant application node A, B,<br>
C is unattainable then a resource can switch to another of the<br>
resource brokers from another of the application nodes A, B, C.<br>
The resource broker for the application node A books five<br>
licenses, the application node B books three licenses and the<br>
application node C initially does not request a license. The<br>
resultant state is shown in figure 2B. In the diagram, the<br>
number of licenses allocated since the last synchronization<br>
step is entered on the right-hand side of the respective<br>
resource broker in the top column; in the column below that,<br>
the number of releasable licenses is also recorded, as known<br>
from the description relating to figure 2A. This number is not<br>
changed at first by the mere allocation of licenses.<br>
In this case, the difference between the number of allocated<br>
licenses and the number of releasable licenses gives that<br>
number of licenses which could still be allocated by the<br><br>
200618565	- 13 -<br>
respective resource broker; fifteen licenses in the case of the<br>
application node A, seventeen license in the case of the<br>
application node B and the original 20 licenses in the case of<br>
the application node C.<br>
The situation shown in figure 2C is obtained when one license<br>
is returned again "released" to the resource broker for the<br>
application node A and two licenses are returned again<br>
("released") to the resource broker for application node B.<br>
Accordingly, the respectively stored number of allocated<br>
licenses is reduced.<br>
The text below describes the changes which are obtained as a<br>
result of a synchronization cycle. In this case, the resource<br>
broker for the application node B is first of all synchronized.<br>
In the present exemplary embodiment, it is left to chance which<br>
of the resource brokers is synchronized first, because in the<br>
present case it is dependent on which of the application nodes<br>
have been engaged first. For the order and for the frequency of<br>
the synchronization steps, however, the widest variety of<br>
scenarios and practices is conceivable. The synchronization<br>
step for the resource broker for application node B is shown<br>
schematically in figure 3A. In a first substep, the relevant<br>
resource broker transmits the balance of the licenses which it<br>
has allocated since the last synchronization step to the<br>
resource store RS. Since this is the first synchronization step<br>
in the present case, this is equal to the balance since the<br>
resource broker for the application node B was engaged or<br>
restarted. Since this application node B has initially<br>
allocated 3 licenses and then two resources have been<br>
deactivated again and hence two licenses have been returned<br>
(released), this balance is "-1". This reduces the number of<br>
available, releasable licenses in the resource store RS by 1 to<br>
"19"; this value is transmitted to the resource broker for the<br>
application node B in the second substep of the synchronization<br>
step and is entered there instead of the "20" as the new value<br>
for the number of releasable licenses. At the same time, the<br><br>
200618565	- 14 -<br>
new "balance" for the number of releasable licenses in this<br>
resource broker is reset to zero, because the resource broker<br>
is now fully synchronized.<br>
Figure 3B shows how the next resource broker for the<br>
application node C is synchronized. The result obtained in this<br>
case is likewise a new value for the number of releasable<br>
licenses "19". Finally, the resource broker for the application<br>
node A is also synchronized; this process is shown<br>
schematically in figure 3C. In figures 3A, 3B and 3C, it can be<br>
seen that the number of licenses respectively allocated<br>
("booked") by the individual resource brokers is recorded in<br>
the resource store RS. It follows from this that besides the<br>
total number of licenses ("total =20") it is not imperative to<br>
store the number of releasable licenses ("available = 15") in<br>
figure 3C; this value can also be recalculated at any time from<br>
the total number and from the individual values ("booked A = 4•<br>
B = 1; C = 0") . Figure 3C shows that the four licenses which<br>
have been allocated by the resource broker for the application<br>
layer A are taken as a basis for re-stipulating both the number<br>
of releasable licenses in the resource store RS and the<br>
corresponding value in the resource broker for the application<br>
node A as "15". This value initially remains at the value "19"<br>
for the other resource brokers because a fresh synchronization<br>
step has not yet been performed with these. That is to say that<br>
for these two remaining resource brokers there continue to be<br>
nineteen licenses available even though there are in fact now<br>
only fifteen licenses left from the total number of "20". This<br>
state continues to exist until the synchronization steps shown<br>
in figures 3D and 3E have been performed. In the meantime, it<br>
is possible for more than the "permitted" twenty licenses to be<br>
allocated. Provided that no resources are used or released in<br>
the meantime, and hence the licenses linked to these resources<br>
are allocated or released, it therefore takes a maximum of two<br>
full synchronization cycles before all the resource brokers are<br>
fully in sync with the resource store RS. In the meantime, more<br>
resources than there is provision for by the total number of<br><br>
200618565	- 15 -<br>
releasable licenses may be used without a. resource being denied<br>
a license.<br>
Figure 4 shows a scenario in which there are initially 20<br>
licenses in total stored in the resource store RS, six of which<br>
are still available ("available = 6"). If the operator of the<br>
arrangement purchases ten further licenses, these ten licenses<br>
are reregistered only at a single location, namely in the<br>
resource store RS. This increases the number of licenses to<br>
thirty ("total = 30"), on the basis of which the number of<br>
releasable licenses is recalculated ("available = 16"). This<br>
number is transferred to the respective synchronized resource<br>
broker in each subsequent synchronization step. The procedure<br>
is similar when licenses are withdrawn from the network or the<br>
arrangement. It should be noted that the practice described,<br>
using repeated synchronization cycles, means that on<br>
statistical average all resource brokers have an identical<br>
number of releasable licenses, regardless of how many licenses<br>
have already been allocated and withdrawn again by the<br>
respective resource broker. Alternatively, the resource store<br>
RS can also have instructions added which prompt an uneven<br>
distribution of the releasable licenses, for example on the<br>
basis of authorizations which are associated with the various<br>
application nodes and their users.<br>
The method described is known to have the advantage that each<br>
application node A, B, C, or each resource broker respectively<br>
has a large number, ideally even the respective actual number,<br>
of releasable licenses available without the need to set up a<br>
respective connection to the resource store RS for the purpose<br>
of allocating licenses. Accordingly, licenses can be allocated<br>
and licenses can be released quickly and also safely.<br>
Furthermore, it is guaranteed that in cases in which releasable<br>
licenses are generally present in the overall arrangement it is<br>
possible for licenses to be freely allocated everywhere within<br>
the context of this number and hence also for peak loads, which<br>
can go beyond the total number of licenses, to be "cushioned".<br><br>
200618565	- 16 -<br>
This firstly means that the number of licenses to be held in<br>
the system does not need to be much greater than the number of<br>
licenses required on average, without losing the capability of<br>
handling load peaks. On the other hand, this has the drawback<br>
that in extreme cases (worst case scenario) the number of<br>
licenses allocated may even exceed a multiple of the total<br>
number of available licenses (releasable licenses), depending<br>
on the number of resource brokers, on the basis of the time<br>
interval for the synchronization steps or synchronization<br>
cycles and on the basis of the use behavior (that is to say the<br>
use of resources).<br>
Figure 5A shows the starting point for such a worst case<br>
scenario. The number of releasable licenses in a total number<br>
("total = 20") has been reduced to three releasable licenses<br>
("available = 3"), because seventeen licenses have been<br>
allocated in total. In addition, the resource brokers for the<br>
application nodes A and B have respectively allocated a further<br>
license, so that - in theory - only one license can now be<br>
allocated in the whole network. Nevertheless, the resource<br>
broker for the application node A can still book two licenses,<br>
in the case of B a further two licenses and in the case of the<br>
application node C three licenses. If it is assumed that such<br>
license demands are actually made before the next<br>
synchronization steps, the state shown in figure 5B is obtained<br>
no later than after the next two synchronization cycles, that<br>
is to say in the state of full synchronization. The number of<br>
releasable licenses ("available = -4") is negative ("-4") both<br>
in the resource store and in the individual resource brokers.<br>
The method can react to this state using various strategies; in<br>
this exemplary embodiment, a plurality of strategies are used.<br>
A first reaction option is that the synchronization of the<br>
resource brokers is performed more frequently so that any<br>
licenses released in the meantime can be used again throughout<br>
the system as quickly as possible. Instead of a shortened time<br>
interval for the synchronization steps, the resource brokers<br>
for the application nodes A, B, C may also be set such that any<br><br>
200618565	- 17 -<br>
released license is immediately reported to the resource store<br>
RS, however. In addition, the resource brokers may be set such<br>
that licenses are allocated only if the respective resource<br>
brokers store a positive value for the releasable licenses.<br>
Alternatively, the resource brokers can also be set such that<br>
"absent" licenses can also be allocated within predetermined<br>
limits and for a prescribed "tolerance time", however. In a<br>
worst case, as shortly after a system start, for example, in<br>
combination with a long synchronization interval and a maximum<br>
network load, the number of licenses allocated "too much" may<br>
reach the number of application nodes multiplied by the total<br>
number of licenses -1.<br>
Figure 6 shows the special case in which precisely one resource<br>
broker is present. In such a case, the synchronization process<br>
is required only in order to make licenses recently added to<br>
the resource store RS in the meantime available and to remove<br>
licenses taken from said resource store from the resource<br>
broker too. The "tolerance mechanisms" just described, which,<br>
even with long synchronization cycles, ensure that the resource<br>
broker can actually allocate all "purchased" licenses, are not<br>
necessary in this scenario.<br>
Finally, figure 7 shows the case in which an application node B<br>
and hence the resource broker installed there fail. Figure 7<br>
shows that the resource broker for the application node B has<br>
provided a further resource with a further license before it<br>
fails and after the last synchronization step; this is shown by<br>
the number "-1" in the top column of the central block in the<br>
figure. At the time of failure, the resource store contains the<br>
information that five licenses have been allocated at the<br>
application node B, because this corresponds to the state of<br>
affairs for the last synchronization.<br>
The failure of application node B is registered by a monitoring<br>
facility ("watchdog"). Registration of the failure can lead to<br>
various reactions, for example the monitoring facility can<br><br>
200618565	- 18 -<br>
attempt to restart the application node B. If this attempt is<br>
unsuccessful, it is assumed that the resources managed by B are<br>
likewise unattainable or have failed. This assessment is<br>
realistic particularly in cases in which a resource needs to<br>
renew or confirm a license which is in use at periodic<br>
intervals of time. In the light of this assumption, the number<br>
of booked licenses attributed to the application node B in the<br>
resource store RS "booked B = 5" is deleted; the allocated<br>
licenses are thus released again in the entire system. After<br>
the next full synchronization cycle, these licenses are thus<br>
available again to the resource brokers for the application<br>
nodes A &amp; C. The possibility described further above, that<br>
resources send their license requests to other resource brokers<br>
in the event of a resource broker or the associated hardware<br>
failing, results in automatic "load balancing", that is to say<br>
automatic load redistribution, taking place, with all further<br>
license requests being sent to the resource brokers for the<br>
application nodes A &amp; C. This continues until the resource<br>
broker for the application node B can be obtained again; during<br>
the next synchronization cycles and during the next resource<br>
use and resource release operations which then occur and the<br>
associated allocation and release actions for the licenses, the<br>
license distribution in the entire system will vvsettle" back to<br>
a normal state.<br>
The measures described above ensure that largely disturbance-<br>
free continued operation of resources is ensured even in the<br>
event of individual failure by application nodes A, B, C and/or<br>
by the resource store RS. Furthermore, the concept of local<br>
allocation of licenses avoids frequent data interchange with a<br>
central entity (in this case: resource store RS), which<br>
minimizes network load further.<br><br>

(RS) respectively, this difference being taken as a basis for<br>
reducing or increasing the number of releasable licenses<br>
registered in the first entity (RS), and conversely the<br>
resultant number of releasable licenses is reported from the<br>
first entity (RS) to the second entity and is registered there<br>
as the number of releasable licenses.</td>
