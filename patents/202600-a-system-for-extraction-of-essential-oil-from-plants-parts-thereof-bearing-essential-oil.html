				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a system for extraction of essential oil from plants/ parts thereof bearing essential oil. More particularly the system is adapted for extraction of oil from fresh betel leaf as well as dried, decayed, dechlorophylled and stale leaves. The system of the present invention is adapted to extract oil at a faster rate, without forming emulsion. The system further prevents loss of extracted oil due to backflow to the distillation flask and escape of vapour, system can also be used to extract essential oil from all other essential oil - yielding crops like rose, mint, basil, Keora and the like.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
India is the largest producer of betel leaf in the world producing a crop of about 9000 million every year.. A survey revealed that on an average about 10 % of the gross production of betel leaf goes waste every year due to improper production, packaging and marketing. Except the peak consumption/demand period extending over a few months around December and January, a substantial amount of betel leaves remain unsold throughout the year. The betel leaf being a highly perishable commodity is always subject to wastage by quick spoilage, which may cause a loss of even 900 million rupees in a year to the Nation. Not only this, particularly in the rainy season a large portion of the leaves is also sold at a throw away price.<br>
Accordingly, attempts were initiated to extract essential oil from such unsold or stranded betel leaves. The essential oil, which is present in the betel leaf, imparts medicinal aromatic, stimulant, tonic, and various other properties in the leaves. Therefore, the leaves of betel vine are traditionally known to be useful for treating cold cough, fever, mastitis, furuncle, abscess, throat affection, acidity, and rheumatism, leucorrhoea, skin affection, constipation, conjunctivitis etc. The betel leaves are traditionally used as mouth freshener, masticant, mild stimulant, appetizer, digestive and nerve tonic. Moreover, this oil has a promising future in the field of skin emollient, tooth paste, tooth powder, pan masala, perfumes, room freshener, de-odorant, soap, face cream cold drink, chocolate, innocence sticks etc.<br>
There are many plant species which produce essential oil through their leaves, roots, barks,<br>
2<br><br>
woods, flowers, fruits seeds etc. Such oils can be grossly classified into two categories namely, i) Heavier than water and ii) Lighter than water, which can be extracted very easily by the simple method of hydro-distillation using the Clevenger apparatus (Fig.  1 ). The<br>
heavier oils are deposited at the bottom of water column in the receiver whereas the lighter<br>
i<br>
oils are deposited at the top/surface of the water column in the receiver. However, the essential oil of betel leaf is neither lighter not heavier than water rather its density is very close to water. Therefore, the droplets of betel leaf oil do not accumulate easily at one point (on top or bottom of the water column) like the essential oil of other crops, rather the droplets mostly remain suspended throughout the water column in the receiver and because of such behaviour, the oil droplets go back to the distillation flask through the feed back tube along with the recycled water. Therefore, there is no substantial collection of oil in the receiver. As such, extraction of essential oil from betel leaf with the help of Clevenger apparatus is very difficult and inefficient. Not only this, there are a few more drawbacks in the Clevenger apparatu^ which makes it unfit for extraction of essential oil from betel leaf. The said drawbacks are:<br>
1.	Slow extraction process. It requires over 3 hours time for completion of oil extraction<br>
process from a single batch of betel leaf.<br>
2.	The glass made condenser of the Clevenger apparatus does not perform condensation<br>
efficiently since glass is a bad conductor of heat.<br>
3.	Due to the self-stirring effect of the falling oil droplets, a milky emulsion is produced<br>
inside the receiver. This emulsion (oil in water) goes back to the distillation flask<br>
through the feed back tube. Thus, the oil recovery is reduced particularly when rapid1<br>
extraction is attempted.<br>
4.	The wide diameter (&gt; 1 cm) of receiver tube of the Clevenger apparatus helps in,<br>
breaking down the oil layer floating on the water surface in the receiver. As a result<br>
numerous tiny droplets are formed at different depths of water owing to near-water<br>
ii<br>
density of the oil. These droplets go back to the distillation flask through the feed back tube and thus, the oil recovery is reduced.<br>
5.	Straight feed back tube (without any controlling devices) reduces oil recovery since :<br>
numerous tiny oil droplets can easily go back to the distillation flask through the it<br>
straight feed back tube.<br>
6.	Some amount of uncondensed oil vapour escapes through the vent of the apparatus<br>
and thus, reduce oil recovery due to lack of proper condensation and vapour trapping<br>
unit.<br>
3<br><br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The basic objective of the present invention is to provide a system for extraction of essential oil from plants/ parts thereof, which would be simple, rapid, efficient, and at the same time cost effective.<br>

The details of the system of the invention illustrated with reference to non limiting accompanying drawings:<br>

Detailed Description of the Accompanying Drawings<br>
Figure 1 shows the schematic view of existing Clevenger apparatus. The Heating mantle (not shown) with the distillation flask (1) is used for distillation. The vapour conducting tube (2) carries the vapour of oil and water to the condenser (3). The condenser is provided with inlet (4) and outlet (5) for water to keep the temperature cool. The lower end of the condenser (6) is straight and ends in a bulb (7) for holding the vapours. The bulb is provided with a vent (8) and leads to the collecting tube (9) . the collecting tube is provided with a feed back tube (10). The feed back tube is a straight tube connecting the collecting tube with the vapor conducting tube. The collecting tube is further provided with a stop cock (11) for controlling oil delivery.<br>
Figure 2 shows the system of the present invention for extraction of betel leaf oil.The electrical heating mantle (not shown) (with maximum energy consumption capacity of 3 KW) with a regulator holds the distillation flask (1) (used for housing the materials to be distilled) in the cavity of the mantle for safe and smooth transfer of heat from the heating coils to the distilling materials.<br>
The round bottom flask (1) made of glass holds the materials for distillation i.e. betel leaves and water, which are boiled to give off water vapour as well as vapours of essential oil of betel leaf. This flask is washed thoroughly with chromic acid before every use for proper recovery of essential oil.<br>
The vapour conducting tube (2) is also made up of glass, which is wider at the base and then narrows down up wards for proper flow of the vapours. The vapours conducting tube is connected to the round bottom flask at the base and also to the condenser (3) at the top. To prevent heat loss from the vapours conducting tube it is covered with encircling asbestos ropes (not shown) otherwise due to loss of heat/ radiation of heat from the vapour conducting tube to the surrounding atmosphere there would be a cooling effect which would condense the vapours particularly the essential oil vapours in to liquid phase and subsequently oil droplets would be formed which would then drop down back to the distillation flask. This ill process would seriously hamper the oil recovery. Therefore, prevention of heat loss is very important and special care is needed for this to be kept under check. Importantly, in order to<br>
6<br><br>
achieve a greater efficiency of extraction work condensation process must be quick. Therefore, materials of construction for the condenser has to be a very good conductor of heat and hence, a metallic condenser made of silver is attached to the betel leaf oil extractor. This condenser is provided with adequate surface area for quick and smooth transfer of heat from "vapours inside the condenser" to the cooling agent flowing out side the condenser. Additionally, this condenser is also provided with adequate obstructing means for impeding further movement of vapours in side the condenser so that the vapours could come to intimate contact with the metallic condenser for greater transfer of heat from vapours to the metallic condenser. . The condenser has been manufactured in a particular shape so as to to be adapted to function as obstructing means, i.e. in some places the internal volume is more and in some places it is minimum. This compels the vapours to expand and contract while moving through the condenser with particular shape. This brings the vapours to intimate contact with the internal surface of the condenser and also causes turbulence. This helps in better exchange of heat energy between the hot vapour and the metallic condenser. The resultant effect is better and quicker cooling effect. Such quick condensation not only increase efficiency of cooling cutting down the time required for condensation of vapours but also increase oil recovery by minimizing/ totally eliminating the escape of uncondensed oil vapours passing out through the vent of the bulb holding the uncondensed vapours. To achieve proper formation of oil droplets after condensation of vapours coming out from the * distillation flask through the vapour conducting tube and metallic condenser contributing to formation of distinct and separate oil layer in the receiver, the apparatus is provided with a curved unit (12) at the end of the metallic condenser (3). The said curved unit is made up of glass and housed in the bulb for holding the uncondensed vapours (7). This unit (12) is devised basically to dissipate the kinetic energy of the rapidly falling oil and water droplets from condensation unit to the water surface in the receiver unit. The rapidly falling droplets cause a self-stirring effect and contribute to the formation of undesired emulsion (oil in water) in receiver very easily due to near water density of the oil and its quick miscibility with water. Due to the said self-stirring effect an emulsion is formed instead of a clear and distinct oil layer formation in the receiver tube. This emulsion easily occupy every portion of the receiver tube whereas distinct and separate layer of essential oil if formed, floats only on the top surface of the water column present in the receiver tube. As such, collection of oil is possible when separate and distinct oil layer is formed but it is almost impossible to collect oil when emulsion is formed. This emulsion easily moves through the feed back tube and goes back to the distillation flask and thus, oil recovery is significantly reduced. On the<br>
7<br><br>
contrary, the floating oil layer does not go back to the distillation flask like the emulsion. To prevent such undesired formation of emulsion, it is necessary to stop the self-stirring effect of the droplets causing such an. effect by the virtue of their being possessing some kinetic energy. This kinetic energy is dissipated by the curved unit by intercepting the falling droplets on its glass surface and then slowly releasing water and oil droplets just on the water surface in the receiver tube. In this way, the undesired emulsification is eliminated and a clear-cut oil layer is formed by the said curved unit.<br>
The bulb for holding uncondensed vapours (7) is also made of glass. This is provided in the apparatus to hold uncondensed vapours if any, that may come out of the condensation unit due to various reasons like very rapid flow of vapours, excessive heating of the distillation flask, improper temperature of cooling water etc. The uncondensed vapours when formed in excess of the capacity of the said bulb, passes on through a vent (8) provided on a side wall of the same said bulb. The delivery tube (13) for uncondensed vapours is made up of glass, which conducts the vapours to a beaker containing cold water and releases the vapours therein for further condensation and/ or absorption for increasing the oil recovery. The oil collection tube (9) is also made up 6f glass with a radius of 
8<br><br>
reduces oil recovery.<br>
The details of working of the said invention is explained through the process and material flow chart (I;ig. 3 )<br>
The system of present invention is used to carry out extraction of essential oil from betel leaf and that from all other essential oil yielding crops. Thus the betel leaves of about 150 (500g) is rinsed, blotted and the petiole are removed. The leaf blades weighing around 422g are minced to a size of lcm. These along with water is put in the distillation flask. The heating mantle is allowed to heat to a temperature of 100°C to start distillation process. The temperature is regulated so that constant boiling is continued . The vapours generated are passed through conducting tube which are condensed in the condenser. The condensed oil droplets are allowed to pass drop by drop by the curved unit to the collecting tube. Clear, distinct oil layer is formed. About 1 ml essential oils is extracted within 2hours 30 minutes without formation of emulsion. The de oiled leaves arc collected, dried at 60 °Cfor 48 hours. Dried de oiled leaves are obtained.<br>
Advantages<br>
