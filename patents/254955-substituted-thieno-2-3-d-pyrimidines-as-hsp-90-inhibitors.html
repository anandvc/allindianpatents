Pyrimidothiophene Compounds<br>
This invention relates to substituted bicyclic thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine (herein referred to as 'pyrimidothiophene') compounds having HSP90 inhibitory activity, to the use of such compounds in medicine, in relation to diseases which are responsive to inhibition of HSP90 activity such as cancers, and to pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds.<br>
Background to the invention<br>
Molecular chaperones maintain the appropriate folding and conformation of proteins and are crucial in regulating the balance between protein synthesis and degradation. They have been shown to be important in regulating many important cellular functions, such as cell proliferation and apoptosis (Jolly and Morimoto, 2000; Smith et al., 1998; Smith, 2001).<br>
Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs)<br>
Exposure of cells to a number of environmental stresses, including heat shock, alcohols, heavy metals and oxidative stress, results in the cellular accumulation of a number of chaperones, commonly known as heat shock proteins (HSPs). Induction of HSPs protects the cell against the initial stress insult, enhances recovery and leads to maintenance of a stress tolerant state. It has also become clear, however, that certain HSPs may also play a major molecular chap^rone role under normal, stress-free conditions by regulating the correct folding, degradation, localization and function of a growing list of important cellular proteins.<br>
A number of multigene families of HSPs exist, with individual gene products varying in cellular expression, function and localization. They are classified according to molecular weight, e.g., HSP70, HSP90, and HSP27. Several diseases in humans can be acquired as a result of protein misfolding (reviewed in Tytell et al., 2001; Smith et al., 1998).   Hence the development of therapies which disrupt the molecular chaperone machinery may prove to be beneficial. In some conditions (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, prion diseases and Huntington's disease), misfolded proteins can cause protein aggregation<br><br>
resulting in neurodegenerative disorders. Also, misfolded proteins may result in loss of wild type protein function, leading to deregulated molecular and physiological functions in the cell.<br>
HSPs have also been implicated in cancer. For example, there is evidence of differential expression of HSPs which may relate to the stage of tumour progression (Martin et al., 2000; Conroy et al., 1996; Kawanishi et al., 1999; Jameeletal., 1992; Hoang et al., 2000; Lebeauetal., 1991). As a result of the involvement of HSP90 in various critical oncogenic pathways and the discovery that certain natural products with anticancer activity are targeting this molecular chaperone, the fascinating new concept has been developed that inhibiting HSP function may be useful in the treatment of cancer. The first molecular chaperone inhibitor is currently undergoing clinical trials.<br>
HSP90<br>
HSP90 constitutes about 1-2% of total cellular protein, and is usually present in the cell as a dimer in association with one of a number of other proteins (see, e.g., Pratt, 1997). It is essential for cell viability and it exhibits dual chaperone functions (Young et al., 2001). It plays a key role in the cellular stress response by interacting with many proteins after their native conformation has been altered by various environmental stresses, such as heat shock, ensuring adequate protein folding and preventing non-specific aggregation (Smith et al., 1998). In addition, recent results suggest that HSP90 may also play a role in buffering against the effects of mutation, presumably by correcting the inappropriate folding of mutant proteins (Rutherford and Lindquist, 1998). However, HSP90 also has an important regulatory role. Under normal physiological conditions, together with its endoplasmic reticulum homologue GRP94, HSP90 plays a housekeeping role in the cell, maintaining the conformational stability and maturation of several key client proteins. These can be subdivided into three groups: (a) steroid hormone receptors, (b) Ser/Thrortyrosine kinases (e.g., ERBB2, RAF-1, CDK4, and LCK), and (c) a collection of apparently unrelated proteins, e.g., mutant p53 and the catalytic subunit of telomerase hTERT. All of these proteins play key regulatory roles in many physiological and biochemical<br><br>
processes in the cell. New HSP90 client proteins are continuously being identified.<br>
The highly conserved HSP90 family in humans consists of four genes, namely the cytosolic HSP90a and HSP90p isoforms (Hickey et al., 1989), GRP94 in the endoplasmic reticulum (Argon et al., 1999) and HSP75/TRAP1 in the mitochondrial matrix (Felts et al., 2000). It is thought that all the family members have a similar mode of action, but bind to different client proteins depending on their localization within the cell. For example, ERBB2 is known to be a specific client protein of GRP94 (Argon et al., 1999) and type 1 tumour necrosis factor receptor (TNFR1) and RB have both been shown to be clients ofTRAPI (Songetal., 1995; Chen etal., 1996).<br>
HSP90 participates in a series of complex interactions with a range of client and regulatory proteins (Smith, 2001). Although the precise molecular details remain to be elucidated, biochemical and X-ray crystallographic studies (Prodromou et al., 1997; Stebbins et al., 1997) carried out over the last few years have provided increasingly detailed insights into the chaperone function of HSP90.<br>
Following earlier controversy on this issue, it is now clear that HSP90 is an ATP-dependent molecular chaperone (Prodromou et al, 1997), with dimerization of the nucleotide binding domains being essential for ATP hydrolysis, which is in turn essential for chaperone function (Prodromou et al, 2000a). Binding of ATP results in the formation of a toroidal dimer structure in which the N terminal domains are brought into closer contact with each other resulting in a conformational switch known as the 'clamp mechanism' (Prodromou and Pearl, 2000b).<br>
Known HSP90 Inhibitors<br>
The first class of HSP90 inhibitors to be discovered was the benzoquinone ansamycin class, which includes the compounds herbimycin A and geldanamycin. They were shown to reverse the malignant phenotype of<br><br>
fibroblasts transformed by the v-Src oncogene (Uehara et al., 1985), and subsequently to exhibit potent antitumour activity in both in vitro (Schulte et al., 1998) and in vivo animal models (Supko et al., 1995).<br>
Immunoprecipitation and affinity matrix studies have shown that the major mechanism of action of geldanamycin involves binding to HSP90 (Whitesell et al., 1994; Schulte and Neckers, 1998). Moreover, X-ray crystallographic studies have shown that geldanamycin competes at the ATP binding site and inhibits the intrinsic ATPase activity of HSP90 (Prodromou et al., 1997; Panaretou et al, 1998).   This in turn prevents the formation of mature multimeric HSP90 complexes capable of chaperoning client proteins. As a result, the client proteins are targeted for degradation via the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. 17-Allylamino, 17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17AAG) retains the property of HSP90 inhibition resulting in client protein depletion and antitumour activity in cell culture and xenograft models (Schulte et al, 1998; Kelland et al, 1999), but has significantly less hepatotoxicity than geldanamycin (Page et al, 1997). 17AAG is currently being evaluated in Phase I clinical trials.<br>
Radicicol is a macrocyclic antibiotic shown to reverse the malignant phenotype of v-Src and v-Ha-Ras transformed fibroblasts (Kwon et al, 1992; Zhao et al, 1995). It was shown to degrade a number of signalling proteins as a consequence of HSP90 inhibition (Schulte et al., 1998). X-ray crystallographic data confirmed that radicicol also binds to the N terminal domain of HSP90 and inhibits the intrinsic ATPase activity (Roe et al., 1998). Radicicol lacks antitumour activity in vivo due to the unstable chemical nature of the compound.<br>
Coumarin antibiotics are known to bind to bacterial DNA gyrase at an ATP binding site homologous to that of the HSP90. The coumarin, novobiocin, was shown to bind to the carboxy terminus of HSP90, i.e., at a different site to that occupied by the benzoquinone ansamycins and radicicol which bind at the N-terminus (Marcu et al., 2000b). However, this still resulted in inhibition of HSP90 function and degradation of a number of HSP90-chaperoned<br><br>
signalling proteins (Marcu et al., 2000a). Geldanamcyin cannot bind HSP90 subsequent to novobiocin; this suggests that some interaction between the N and C terminal domains must exist and is consistent with the view that both sites are important for HSP90 chaperone properties.<br>
A purine-based HSP90 inhibitor, PU3, has been shown to result in the degradation of signalling molecules, including ERBB2, and to cause cell cycle arrest and differentiation in breast cancer cells (Chiosis et al., 2001).<br>
Patent publications WO 2004/050087 and WO 2004/056782 relate to known classes pyrazole derivatives which are HSP90 inhibitors.<br>
HSP90 as a Therapeutic Target<br>
Due to its involvement in regulating a number of signalling pathways that are crucially important in driving the phenotype of a tumour, and the discovery that certain bioactive natural products exert their effects via HSP90 activity, the molecular chaperone HSP90 is currently being assessed as a new target for anticancer drug development (Neckers et al., 1999).<br>
The predominant mechanism of action of geldanamycin, 17AAG, and radicicol involves binding to HSP90 at the ATP binding site located in the N-terminal domain of the protein, leading to inhibition of the intrinsic ATPase activity of HSP90(see, e.g., Prodromou etal., 1997; Stebbinsetal., 1997; Panaretou et al., 1998).<br>
Inhibition of HSP90 ATPase activity prevents recruitment of co-chaperones and encourages the formation of a type of HSP90 heterocomplex from which these client proteins are targeted for degradation via the ubiquitin proteasome pathway (see, e.g., Neckers etal., 1999; Kelland etal., 1999).<br>
Treatment with HSP90 inhibitors leads to selective degradation of important proteins involved in cell proliferation, cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, processes which are fundamentally important in cancer.<br><br>
Inhibition of HSP90 function has been shown to cause selective degradation of important signalling proteins involved in cell proliferation, cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, processes which are fundamentally important and which are commonly deregulated in cancer (see, e.g., Hostein et al., 2001). An attractive rationale for developing drugs against this target for use in the clinic is that by simultaneously depleting proteins associated with the transformed phenotype, one may obtain a strong antitumour effect and achieve a therapeutic advantage against cancer versus normal cells. These events downstream of HSP90 inhibition are believed to be responsible for the antitumour activity of HSP90 inhibitors in cell culture and animal models (see, e.g., SchulteetaL, 1998; Kelland e: al., 1999).<br>

Also included within the scope of the invention are metabolites of compounds of formula (I), that is, compounds formed in vivo upon administration of the drug. Some examples of metabolites include<br><br><br><br>
Alk1 and Alk2 may be, for example, optionally substituted divalent radicals selected from -CH2, CH2CH2- or-CH=CH-. Optional substituents in Alk1 and Alk2 include, for example mono- or di(d-C3alkyl)amino and d-C3alkoxy; and<br>
Z may be, for example, -O- or -NH-; and Q is hydrogen.<br>
In a simple subclass of compounds with which the invention is concerned, m is 1 and each of p, r and s is 0, and Q is hydrogen, so that R2 is optionally substituted aryl or heteroaryl. In such cases, R2 may be, for example, optionally substituted phenyl, 2- or 3-thienyl, 2- or 3- furanyl, 2-, 3- or 4-pyridinyl, morpholinyl, or piperidinyl. Currently preferred are compounds wherein R2 is optionally substituted phenyl, for example where the optional substituents are selected from methyl, ethyl, n- or isopropyl, vinyl, allyl, methoxy, ethoxy, n-propyloxy, benzyloxy, allyloxy, cyanomethoxy chloro, bromo, cyano, formyl, methyl-, ethyl-, or n-propyl-carbonyloxy, methyl- or ethylaminocarbonyl.

In other simple structures, m is 1, p, r and s are again each 0, and Q may be an optionally substituted carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring, for example phenyl, cyclohexyl, pyridyl, morpholino, piperidinyl, or piperazinyl ring. In such cases, Q is a direct substituent in the optionally substituted Ar1 ring.<br>
In more complex structures with which the invention is concerned, one or more of m, p, r and s may be 1, and Q may be hydrogen or an optionally substituted carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring. For example, p and/or s may be 1 and r may be 0, so that Q is linked to Ar1 by an alkylene or alkenylene radical,<br><br>
for example a C1-C3 alkylene radical, which is optionally substituted. In other cases each of p, r, and s may be 1, in which cases, Q is linked to Ar1 by an alkylene or alkenylene radical which is interrupted by the hetero atom-containing Z radical. In still other cases, p and s may be 0 and r may be 1, in which case Q is linked to Ar1 via the hetero atom-containing Z radical.<br>
Specific examples of R2 groups usable in compounds of the invention include those present in the compounds of the Examples herein.<br>

Fluorescence Polarization Assay<br>
Fluorescence polarization {also known as fluorescence anisotropy} measures the rotation of a fluorescing species in solution, where the larger molecule the more polarized the fluorescence emission. When the fluorophore is excited with polarized light, the emitted light is also polarized. The molecular size is proportional to the polarization of the fluorescence emission.<br><br>
The fluoroscein-labelled probe - RBT0045864-FAM -<br><br>
binds to HSP90 {full-length human, full-length yeast or N-terminal domain HSP90} and the anisotropy {rotation of the probe:protein complex} is measured.<br>
Test compound is added to the assay plate, left to equilibrate and the anisotropy measured again. Any change in anisotropy is due to competitive binding of compound to HSP90, thereby releasing probe.<br>
