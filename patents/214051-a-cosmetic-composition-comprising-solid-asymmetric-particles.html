COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (See Section 10)<br>
1. TITLE OF INVENTION<br>
A COSMETIC COMPOSITION COMPRISING SOLID ASYMMETRIC<br>
PARTICLES<br>
2. HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation. Mumbai - 400 020, Maharashtra, India.<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br><br>
The invention relates to cosmetic skin creams having low pH and providing a high skin friction.<br>
Consumers living in hot, humid climates, or consumers with oily skin, desire cosmetic products that have unique tactile properties during use.  Specifically, such products should, upon application to the skin, deliver a high skin friction and a matte finish to overcome the oily skin feel and shiny skin appearance. The greater the increase in skin friction, the less greasy the user perceives the product to be.  See Laufer et al., "Objective Measurement and Self-Assessment of Skin-Care Treatments", Cosmetics and Toiletries Magazine, Vol. Ill, June 1996, pp. 92-96.<br>
More specifically, the typical sensory and optical features of these high skin friction and matte finish creams, also known as vanishing creams, are to: 1) provide a dry, draggy, non-greasy feel to skin; 2) provide a non-shiny, matte finish; 3) spread easily on the skin; 4) absorb or "vanish" rapidly into the skin. The traditionally used vanishing creams contain high levels of stearic acid and alkaline metal soap as an emulsifier, which is important to physical stability of the product. The soap is formed by the in situ neutralization with caustic potash or other alkali on a portion of the stearic acid. Consequently, the creams made by saponification of stearic acid have a pH limit, i.e., greater than 5.7, in order to maintain the right balance of acid and acid soap.  The anionic soap becomes inactive in<br><br><br>
acidic conditions in which hydrolysis occurs,  resulting in undissociated stearic acid, and therefore causes physical stability problem at low pH.<br>
The lack of physical stability of the acid soap emulsified vanishing creams at low pH is a disadvantage that restricts the use therein of valuable acidic benefit actives, such as alpha-hydroxy carboxylic acids, because the acidic actives reduce the pH of the compositions.  However, emerging trends in skin care have required that vanishing cream formulations be adapted to incorporate acidic skin benefit agents.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,153,177 (Bartolone et al.)   discloses vanishing creams containing acid soap which have a pH above 5 and, therefore, include alkali or alkaline earth metal salts of alpha-hydroxy acid (AHA) to achieve skin lightening benefit.  Care was taken not to include the acid form of AHA into the formulation in order to avoid destabilization of the base by the acid for the reasons stated above.<br>
However, it is generally- accepted that actives in their acidic form penetrate the skin better than their ionized form, and salt or electrolyte tends to affect the sensory feel of soap-based vanishing cream form. See Percutaneous Penetration Enhancers, CRC press, pp. 407 (1995).<br>
Therefore, it was clear that further work was necessary in order to enhance the performance of vanishing creams in delivery of acidic skin benefit agent, while maintaining the sensory attributes of traditional vanishing creams.<br><br><br>
WO 01/70187 (Dwiwahyu et al.)     discloses low pH (2-4.8), non-acid soap vanishing cream with enhanced skin benefit properties.  A C8-C22 fatty acid substituted saccharide is used to stabilize the low pH stearic acid-based vanishing cream. Although these compositions are said to deliver an acidic skin benefit agent, the sensory characteristics of traditional vanishing creams have not been realized, which is believed to be due to the lack of a proper emulsifier system.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,536,519 (Suzuki, et al) discloses emulsified cosmetic compositions, including vanishing cream, using a neutralized phosphoric acid ester as an emulsifier, a nonionic surfactant with HLB
Therefore, there is a need to provide a pH insensitive and stable cosmetic composition which not only maintains the unique sensory characteristics of vanishing cream but also enable to incorporate pH sensitive skin benefit agents.<br>
The shortcomings of the prior art are addressed with compositions that can provide the consumer-desired sensory properties of traditional vanishing creams, stable at low pH, that go beyond the pH tolerance range of an acid soap formulation.<br><br><br>
In a first aspect the present invention includes a cosmetic composition comprising:<br>
(a)	at least about 4% by weight of the composition of solid asymmetric particles;<br>
(b)	an anionic emulsifier selected from the group consisting of alkyl sulphates, aralkyl sulphates, alkyl ethoxy ether sulphates, alkaryl sulphonates, alkyl succinates, alkyl sulphosuccinates, N-alkoyl sarcosinates, isethionates, N-acyl taurate, fatty acid amides of methyl tauride and combinations thereof; and<br>
(c)	a cosmetically acceptable vehicle;<br>
wherein the pH of the composition is less than about 5.7; and<br>
wherein the composition has a normal stress of less than minus about 100 milli-Newtons.<br>
The composition may further contain acidic skin benefit agents.  Skin benefit agents for purposes of the present invention include alpha-hydroxy carboxylic acids, beta-hydroxy carboxylic acids, poly-hydroxy carboxylic acids, and mixtures thereof. Examples of alpha-hydroxy carboxylic acids are glycolic acid, lactic acid, 2-hydroxyoctanoic acid, and mixtures thereof. An example of beta-hydroxy carboxylic acid is salicylic acid.  Other suitable acidic skin benefit agents include ferulic acid and sebacic acid.<br>
The present invention also includes a cosmetic method of controlling or preventing an oily skin appearance and/or<br><br><br>
feel especially in the facial area, by applying to the skin the inventive composition.<br>
Except in the operating and comparative examples, or where otherwise explicitly indicated, all numbers in this description indicating amounts of material or conditions of reaction, physical properties of materials and/or use are to be understood as modified by the word "about." All amounts are by weight of the final composition, unless otherwise specified.<br>
As used herein, the term "comprising" means including, made up of, composed of, consisting and/or consisting essentially of.<br>
The term "skin" as used herein includes the skin on the face, neck, chest, back, arms, hands, legs and scalp.<br>
The term "solid" as used herein means that the material is not fluid at 25°C.<br>
The term "fluid" as used herein means that the material is fluid at 25°C.<br>
In order to provide the consumer-desired sensory properties of traditional vanishing creams, stable at low pH, that go beyond the pH tolerance range of an acid soap formulation the cosmetic compositions of the present invention include:<br>
(a)	at least about 4% by weight of the composition of solid asymmetric particles,-<br>
(b)	an anionic emulsifier selected from the group consisting of alkyl sulphates, aralkyl sulphates,<br>
6<br><br>
alkyl ethoxy ether sulphates, alkaryl sulphonates, alkyl succinates, alkyl sulphosuccinates, N-alkoyl sarcosinates, isethionates, N-acyl taurate, fatty acid amides of methyl tauride and combinations thereof; and (c)  a cosmetically acceptable vehicle;<br>
wherein the pH of the composition is less than about 5.7; and<br>
wherein the composition has a normal stress of less than minus about 100 milli-Newtons.<br>
Preferably, the asymetric particles are platelike, such that upon application to skin, the particles align under shear to produce the negative normal stress that is perceived as a dry and draggy feel on the skin surface.  Preferred platelike asymetric particles are fatty acid crystals.<br>
The product consistency is also achieved through the use of pH stable structurants to replace the acid soap network. The anionic emulsifiers referred to above are such pH-stable structurants and are able to remain as anionic at low pH to stabilize the system, as well as non-ionic emulsifiers that may optionally be used in combination with the anionic emulsifiers.<br>
The composition may further contain acidic skin benefit agents.  Skin benefit agents for purposes of the present invention include alpha-hydroxy carboxylic acids, beta-hydroxy carboxylic acids, poly-hydroxy carboxylic acids, and<br><br><br>
mixtures thereof. Examples of alpha-hydroxy carboxylic acids are glycolic acid, lactic acid, 2-hydroxyoctanoic acid, and mixtures thereof. An example of beta-hydroxy carboxylic acid is salicylic acid.  Other suitable acidic skin benefit agents include ferulic acid and sebacic acid.<br>
The present invention also includes a cosmetic method of controlling or preventing an oily skin appearance and/or feel, especially in the facial area, by applying to the skin the inventive composition.<br>
The inventive compositions employ asymmetric solid particles to impart a cream-like viscosity.  Furthermore, by virtue of being asymmetric, the particles deliver high skin friction. Suitable solid particles include fatty acid crystals, mica, talc, clays and mixtures thereof. The preferred solid particlesare selected from the fatty acid crystals wherein fatty acid contains from 12-22 carbon atoms, because they are inexpensive and the most aesthetically acceptable.  The most preferred fatty acid is stearic acid.<br>
The inventive compositions contain at least 4% of the asymmetric solid particles, preferably at least 10%, more preferably from 10% to 25%, most preferably from 12% to 20% to obtain the best feel, appearance, and viscosity. The exact amount depends on the final composition and the nature of the other ingredients in the composition.  The amount of the asymmetric solid particles, however, must be sufficient to impart the vanishing cream-like consistency to the composition, i.e. having the viscosity profiles at three<br><br><br>
defined shear rates as specified below under the defined measurement conditions.<br>
The inventive compositions have viscosity profiles of vanishing creams at three defined shear rates:<br>
(1)	about 10 to about 75 Pascal-seconds (PaS) at a shear rate<br>
of 1 reciprocal second (s ),<br>
-1<br>
(2)	about 2 to about 25 PaS at a shear rate of 10 s , and<br>
-l<br>
(3)	about 0.6 to about 5 PaS at a shear rate of 100 s .<br>
in order to provide a cream consistency that can be rubbed in easily.<br>
Preferably the viscosity profiles are:<br>
(la) about 15 to about 60 PaS at a shear rate of 1 s ,<br>
(2a) about 2.5 to about 15 PaS at a shear rate of 10 s , and<br>
(3a) about 0.8 to about 3 PaS at a shear rate of 100 s .<br>
Most preferably, the viscosity profile is:<br>
(lb) about 20 to about 50 PaS at a shear rate of 1 s ,<br>
(2b) about 3 to about 7 PaS at a shear rate of 10 s , and<br>
-l (3b) about 1 to about 2 PaS at a shear rate of 100 s<br>
The procedure for measuring viscosity is as follows: Viscosity is measured using a rheometer with a shearing force capability and normal force transducer (e.g. ARES<br><br><br>
(Advanced Rheometric Expansion System) from Rheometrics). Samples are compressed between parallel plates of a diameter 25 mm and gap (distance between two plates) of 100 microns. The measurements are made in a shear sweep mode with a shear rate range from 0 to 10,000 sec-1. Measurements are conducted at room temperature (i.e. 25°C) and pressure.<br>
In the inventive compositions, the solid asymmetric particles are dispersed in water.  Acidic skin benefit agents and anionic surfactants are employed in such amounts as to provide a desired skin benefit and yet to not compromise the high skin friction of the inventive compositions.<br>
The skin friction is measured by normal stress. Normal stress is the force exerted by the material in the axial direction during shearing flow.  Normal stresses arise when the material (product) microstructure becomes anisotropic under flow. Negative normal stresses are generated by a decrease in bulk "volume" such as shear-induced ordering. Materials exhibiting this behavior are crystalline phases (e.g. fatty acids), rods, platelets, liquid crystals, and surfactant lamellar mesophases.<br>
Normal force is measured by a measuring procedure using a rheometer with a shearing force capability and normal force transducer (e.g. ARES (Advanced Rheometric Expansion System) from Rheometrics). Samples are compressed between parallel plates of a diameter 25 mm and gap (distance between two plates) of 100 microns.   The measurements are made in a shear sweep mode with a shear rate range from 0 to 10,000<br><br><br>
sec"1.  The normal stress value was calculated as the difference between the force at zero shear rate and force at highest shear rate. A negative difference of less than -100 milli-Newtons is correlated to products/materials with the draggy sensation (high skin friction). Measurement is conducted at room temperature (25°C).<br>
The inventive compositions have the normal stress of less than about minus 100 milli-Newtons; preferably less than minus 200 milli-Newtons; most preferably, in order to obtain the most desired high skin friction, less than about minus 100 milli-Newtons; e.g. from about minus 200 milliNewtons to about minus 2000 milli-Newtons.<br>

2006®) , diethylene triamine penta (methylene phosphonic<br>
acid) and hexamethylene diamine tetra (methylene phosphonic acid) .<br>
Other suitable additional heavy metal ion sequestrants for use herein include nitrilotriacetic acid and<br><br><br>
polyaminocarboxylic acids such as ethylenediaminotetracetic acid, or ethylenetriamine pentacetic acid.<br>
Still other suitable additional heavy metal ion sequestrants for use herein are iminodiacetic acid derivatives such as 2-hydroxyethyl diacetic acid or glyceryl imino diacetic acid.<br>
Antioxidants are included in the inventive compositions in an amount of from 0.01 to 10%, preferably from 0.1 to 5%, most preferably from 0.2 to 4%. Reducing agents are included in the inventive compositions in an amount of from 0.01 to 10%, preferably from 0.1 to 5%, most preferably from 0.2 to 4%. Chelating agents are included in the inventive compositions in an amount of from 0.01 to 1%, preferably from 0.05 to 0.5%, most preferably from 0.05 to 0.3%.<br>
Various other types of active ingredients may be present in cosmetic compositions of the present invention. Actives are defined as skin or hair benefit agents other than emollients and other than ingredients that merely improve the physical characteristics of the composition. Although not limited to this category, general examples include skin lightening agents (other than acidic skin benefit agents), sunscreens and tanning agents.<br>
Sunscreens include those materials commonly employed to block ultraviolet light. Illustrative compounds are the derivatives of PABA, cinnamate and salicylate.  For example, octyl methoxycinnamate and 2-hydroxy-4-methoxy benzophenone (also known as oxybenzone) can be used.  Octyl methoxycinnamate and 2-hydroxy-4-methoxy benzophenone are<br><br><br>
commercially available under the trademarks, Parsol MCX and Benzophenone-3, respectively.<br>
The exact amount of sunscreen employed in the emulsions can vary depending upon the degree of protection desired from the sun"s UV radiation. However, the amount of sunscreens added should not compromise the high skin friction of the inventive compositions as defined previously for the emollient materials.<br>
Another preferred optional ingredient is selected from essential fatty acids (EFAs), i.e., those fatty acids which are essential for the plasma membrane formation of all cells, in keratinocytes EFA deficiency makes cells hyperproliterative. Supplementation of EFA corrects this.  EFAs also enhance lipid biosynthesis of epidermis and provide lipids for the barrier formation of the epidermis. The essential fatty acids are preferably chosen from linoleic acid, gamma linolenic acid, homo-gamma-linolenic acid, columbinic acid, eicosa-(n-6,9,13)-trienoic acid, arachidonic acid, gamma linolenic acid, timnodonic acid, hexaenoic acid and mixtures thereof.<br>
Other optional ingredients may include coloring agents, opacifiers and pigments (e.g. titanium dioxide, silica) and perfumes. Amounts of these materials may range anywhere from 0.001% up to 20% by weight of the composition.<br>
The composition according to the invention is intended primarily as  a cosmetic product for topical application  to human skin, especially as an agent for lightening or depigmenting the skin, conditioning and smoothening the skin,<br><br><br>
and preventing or reducing the appearance of wrinkled or aged skin.<br>
In use, a small quantity of the composition, for example from 1 to 5 ml, is applied to exposed areas of the skin, from a suitable container or applicator and, if necessary, it is then spread over and/or rubbed into the skin using the hand or fingers or a suitable device.<br>
The composition can be packaged in a suitable container to suit its viscosity and intended use by the consumer. For example, a composition can simply be stored in a non-deformable bottle or squeeze container, such as a tube or a lidded jar.<br>
The invention accordingly also provides a closed container (which may be resealable) containing a cosmetically acceptable composition as herein defined.<br>
The following specific examples further illustrate the invention, but the invention is not limited thereto.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Examples 1 to. 5<br>
Examples of formulations according to the present invention are outlined in Table 1.<br><br><br><br>
The formulations presented in Table 1 are prepared in the following fashion. Phase A components are heated to 75°C. Phase B is heated to 75CC in a container separate from that of Phase A. Thereafter the phases are combined, with mixing with the heat being turned off. Phase C is heated to 62 °C and mixed into Phases A/B at 62 °C. The mixture is cooled until 40*C and then packed.<br><br><br>
Examples 6-13<br>
A set of comparative compositions were prepared to demonstrate the special advantage of formulating to achieve 5  a normal force value of less than -100 milli-Newton, and the required viscosity ranges of a vanishing cream at defined<br>
shear rates, i.e. 10 to 75 PaS at a shear rate of 1 s ,2<br>
-1 to 20 at a shear rate of 10 s  and 0.6 to 5 Pas at a shear<br>
rate of 100 s .  For comparison, an acid soap-based<br>
10  vanishing cream composition (Example 6) was also prepared, and its rheological properties were measured as well.  The compositions, pH, and rheological properties of the comparative Examples 6-13 are listed in Table 2 below.<br><br><br><br>
Table 2<br>
Normal forces and viscosity were measured using a controlled strain rheometer which a shearing force capability and normal force transducer (e.g. ARES (Advanced Rheometric<br><br><br>
Expansion System from Rheometrics Corporation. Normal force measurements appearing under Table 2 as well as those in the subsequent Example were measured in the following manner. Samples were compressed between parallel plates of diameter of 25 mm and gap of 100 micron. Measurements were made in a shear sweep mode with a shear rate range from 0 to 10,000<br>
sec .  The normal stress value was calculated as the<br>
difference between the force at zero shear rate and force at highest shear rate. Measurements were conducted at room temperature 25°C.<br>
Sensory evaluation of the preferred examples listed in Table 1 and 2 by expert panelists were proven to be matching the vanishing cream made from the acid-soap.<br>
Example 14<br>
This example demonstrates a typical composition outside of the present invention having positive normal force and viscosity profiles at the defined shear rates outside of those of a vanishing cream.  The composition is listed in Table 3.<br><br><br>
Table 3<br><br><br>
The composition has pH =3.8.<br>
The compositions of Example 14, Table 3, were prepared as follows:<br>
1.	Heat Phase A to 80°C<br>
2.	Heat Phase B to 75"C in a separate container<br>
3.	Add B to A and mix with heat off for 30 min.<br>
4.	At 50°C add Phase C and mix for 10 min.<br>
Table 4 lists the normal force and viscosity values for the composition of Example 14.<br>
Table 4<br><br>
	Normal force, Milli -Newton	Viscosity, Pas<br><br><br>
	at 1 s	at 10 s"	at 100 s"1<br>
Example 14	+160	92	11	1.63<br>
As shown in Table 4, the composition of Example 14 has a positive normal force because it has insufficient stearic acid level and a high oil to stearic acid ratio, which is outside the scope of this invention, as shown in Table 3.<br>
