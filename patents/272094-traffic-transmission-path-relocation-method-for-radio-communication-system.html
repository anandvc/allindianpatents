Description<br>
TRAFFIC TRANSMISSION PATH RELOCATION METHOD<br>
FOR RADIO COMMUNCIATION SYSTEM<br>
Technical Field<br>
[1] The present invention relates to an E-UMTS (Evolved Universal Mobile Telecom-<br>
munications System) and, more particularly, to a method for effectively relocating a<br>
traffic transmission path when a mobile terminal changes a gateway for traffic<br>
transmission.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2] FIG. 1 is a network structure of the E-UMTS, a mobile communication system<br>
applicable to the related art and the present invention.<br>
[3] The E-UMTS system has been evolved from the UMTS system, for which the<br>
3GPP is proceeding with the preparation of the basic specifications applicable thereto.<br>
The E-UMTS system can be classified as an LTE (Long Term Evolution) system.<br>
[4] With reference to FIG. 1, the E-UMTS network is divided into an E-UTRAN 20<br>
and an EPC (Evolved Packet Core) 10. The E-UTRAN 20 includes a terminal (UE<br>
(User Equipment)), a base station (eNB or eNode B) 21 and an AG (Access Gateway)<br>
11 (which also can be expressed as 'MME/UPE'). The AG 11 can be divided into a part<br>
for handling user traffic and a part for handling control traffic. The AG part for<br>
handling new user traffic and the AG part for handling control traffic can communicate<br>
with each other via newly defined interface.<br>
[5] One or more cells may exist in a single eNode B (eNB) 21, and an interface for<br>
transmitting the user traffic and the control traffic can be used between the eNode Bs.<br>
[6] The EPC 10 may include an AG 11, a node for user registration of the UE, and the<br>
like. Also, in the UMTS of FIG. 1, an interface for discriminating the E-UTRAN 20<br>
and the EPC 10 can be used. An S1 interface can connect a plurality of nodes (i.e., in a<br>
many-to-many manner) between the eNode B 21 and the AG 11. The eNode Bs are<br>
connected with each other through an X2 interface, and the X2 interface is always<br>
present between adjacent eNode Bs in a meshed network structure.<br>
[7] Layers of a radio interface protocol between the UE and a network can be divided<br>
into a first layer (L1), a second layer (L2) and a third layer (L3) based upon the three<br>
lower layers of an open system interconnection (OSI) standard model that is well-<br>
known in the art of communication systems.<br>
[8] The first layer (L1) provides an information transfer service using a physical<br>
channel, and a radio resource control (RRC) layer positioned at the third layer (L3)<br>
serves to control radio resources between the terminal and the network, for which the<br>
2<br>
WO 2007/024112 PCT/KR2006/003340<br>
RRC layer exchanges an RRC message between the terminal and the network. The<br>
RRC layer can be distributed so as to be positioned in network nodes such as the<br>
eNode Bs and the AGs, etc., or can be positioned only in the eNode Bs or in the AGs.<br>
[9] Fig 2 illustrates a control plane structure of the radio access interface protocol<br>
between the terminal and the UTRAN based upon various 3GPP wireless access<br>
network standards.<br>
[10] The radio access interface protocol has horizontal layers including a physical layer,<br>
a data link layer and a network layer, and has vertical planes including a user plane for<br>
transmitting data information and a control plane for transmitting control signals.<br>
[11] The protocol layers can be divided into a first layer (L1), a second layer (L2) and a<br>
third layer (L3) based upon the three lower layers of an open system interconnection<br>
(OSI) standard model that is well-known in the art of communication systems. Each<br>
layer of the control plane of the radio protocol in FIG. 2 and the user plane of the radio<br>
protocol in FIG. 3 will now be described.<br>
[12] The physical layer, the first layer, provides an information transmission service to<br>
an upper layer by using a physical channel. The physical layer is connected with a<br>
medium access control (MAC) layer located at a higher level through a transport<br>
channel, and data between the MAC layer and the physical layer is transferred via the<br>
transport channel. Between different physical layers, namely, between physical layers<br>
of a transmission side and a reception side, data is transferred via the physical channel.<br>
[ 13] The MAC layer of the second layer provides a service to a radio link control (RLC)<br>
layer, an upper layer, via a logical channel. The RLC layer of the second layer reliably<br>
supports a data transmission. The function of the RLC layer can be implemented as a<br>
function block within the MAC layer, and in this case, the RLC layer may not be<br>
present. A PDCP layer of the second layer performs a header compression function for<br>
reducing unnecessary control information so that data transmitted by using IP packets<br>
such as IPv4 or IPv6 can be effectively transmitted via a radio interface with a<br>
relatively small bandwidth.<br>
[14] A radio resource control (RRC) layer located at the lowest portion of the third layer<br>
(L3) is only defined in the control plane and controls logical channels, transport<br>
channels and the physical channels in relation to the configuration, reconfiguration,<br>
and release of the radio bearers (RBs). Here, the RB signifies a service provided by the<br>
second layer (L2) for data transmission between the terminal and the UTRAN.<br>
[15] Downlink transport channels for transmitting data from the network to the terminal,<br>
include a broadcast channel (BCH) for transmitting system information and a downlink<br>
shared channel (SCH) for transmitting the user traffic or the control message.<br>
Downlink multicast, traffic of a broadcast service or a control message can be<br>
transmitted through the downlink SCH or through a separate downlink multicast<br>
3<br>
WO 2007/024112 PCT/KR2006/003340<br>
channel (MCH).<br>
[16] Uplink transport channels for transmitting data from the terminal to the network<br>
include a random access channel (RACH) for transmitting an initial control message<br>
and an uplink SCH for transmitting the user traffic and the control message.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Problem<br>
[17] In the related art, when a mobile terminal cannot be connected with a gateway (i.e.,<br>
AG) for traffic transmission, the mobile terminal is currently connected to use because<br>
of its mobility any longer or when the gateway cannot be sustained in terms of other<br>
operations, the mobile terminal changes its connection to a gateway suitable for a base<br>
station into which it has been moved.<br>
[18] In this respect, however, the change to the new gateway increases traffic congestion<br>
of a network because of context information exchanged between the gateways and<br>
signaling message transmissions between many base stations and gateways, and the<br>
like.<br>
Technical Solution<br>
[19] One exemplary feature of the present invention is to provide a method for relocating<br>
a traffic transmission path of a mobile terminal capable of optimizing transmission of a<br>
signaling message to thus minimize congestion of a network when a mobile terminal<br>
changes a gateway for traffic transmission.<br>
[20] To implement at least the above feature in whole or in parts, the present invention<br>
provides a method for relocating a traffic transmission path in a mobile communication<br>
system that may include: when a mobile terminal performs handover from a first radio<br>
network node to a second radio network node, determining a gateway for processing<br>
traffic most suitable for the second radio network node; changing a traffic transmission<br>
path to the determined gateway; and transmitting, by a traffic transmission node, traffic<br>
to the second radio network node through the changed traffic transmission path.<br>
[21] The first radio network node may be a base station to which the mobile terminal is<br>
currently connected to receive a service, and the second radio network node may be a<br>
base station to which the mobile terminal is to move to receive a service.<br>
[22] In the traffic transmission path relocation method, the traffic transmission path<br>
changing step includes: transmitting by the second radio network node, a relocation<br>
request message to the determined first gateway; transmitting, by the first gateway<br>
which has received the relocation request message, a path optimization request<br>
message to a gateway from which the terminal had previously received a service; and<br>
transmitting, by the second gateway, a response message to the first gateway and<br>
informing a traffic transmission node within a network that the traffic path has been<br>
4<br>
WO 2007/024112 PCT/KR2006/003340<br>
changed.<br>
[23] The relocation request message may include context information of the terminal<br>
such as authentication information of the mobile terminal, security information and<br>
compression related information.<br>
[24] The path optimization request message may include the context information and<br>
identification information of the terminal.<br>
[25] The first gateway registers the terminal on a terminal list of the first gateway itself<br>
manages according to the response message and the second gateway may delete the<br>
context information with respect to the terminal and also delete the terminal from a<br>
terminal list managed by itself.<br>
[26] The foregoing and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present<br>
invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the<br>
present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>

Mode for the Invention<br>
[42] One aspect of the present invention relates to the recognition by the present<br>
inventors about the problems of the related art as described above, and further<br>
explained hereafter. Based upon this recognition, the features of the present invention<br>
have been developed.<br>
[43] Although the present invention is shown to be implemented in a mobile com-<br>
munication system, such as a UMTS developed under 3GPP specifications, the present<br>
invention can also be applied to other communication systems operating in conformity<br>
with different standards and specifications.<br>
[44] As network technology continues to develop, it is foreseen that RNCs may no<br>
longer be necessary in future networks, because Node Bs with enhanced capabilities,<br>
or other types of network entities (e.g. so-called Access Gateways) may handle the<br>
operations performed by currently existing RNCs. Such long-term evolution issues<br>
further support the need to develop improved radio admission control techniques to be<br>
used in admitting new terminals (or establishing new user links) and supporting newly<br>
developing enhanced services for a greater number of terminals being managed by the<br>
network.<br>
[45] The present invention provides a traffic transmission path relocation method<br>
capable of minimizing traffic congestion of a network and minimizing an unnecessary<br>
signaling process when a mobile terminal wants to change an access gateway (AG) of<br>
a radio network, with which the mobile terminal is currently connected due to the<br>
mobility of the radio terminal.<br>
[46] Namely, when the mobile terminal changes its connection from a first radio<br>
network node, with which the mobile terminal is currently connected with, to a second<br>
radio network node, the wireless communication system changes or newly sets a<br>
gateway node for processing traffic most suitable for the second radio network node, to<br>
thus optimize transmission efficiency.<br>
[47] Preferably, the first radio network node may be a base station node source eNB with<br>
6<br>
WO 2007/024112 PCT/KR2006/003340<br>
which the mobile terminal is currently connected to receive a service, and the second<br>
radio network node may be a base station node target eNB to which the mobile<br>
terminal is going to move to receive a service.<br>
[48] FIG. 4 shows an exemplary network structure model for explaining an exemplary<br>
relocation method according to the present invention, namely, a basic network con-<br>
figuration related to AG relocation.<br>
[49] With reference to FIG. 4, an Inter-Autonomous System (inter-AS) 100 is a higher<br>
level network node, and a service to be transmitted to the terminal is transmitted to<br>
AGs (sAG 200 and tAG 210) via the Inter-AS (e.g., a traffic transmission node) 100.<br>
The Inter-As 100 can serve as an anchor for interworking with a different network. Al-<br>
ternatively, a network node that is located at a higher level than the AGs and serves as<br>
the anchor for interworking with a different network can act as the Inter-AS 100. The<br>
AGs are connected with each other directly or indirectly. Namely, two AGs may be<br>
connected together with or without other network nodes therebetween.<br>
[50] The sAG (source AG) 200 is an AG with which the terminal is being currently<br>
connected to receive a service. The sAG 200 may have information related to the<br>
terminal. The terminal-related information may include authentication information,<br>
security information, compression-related information, service information and TA<br>
(Tracking Area) information, etc. The sAG 200 includes a PDCP, a security-related<br>
protocol, and compression-related protocols with respect to the terminal.<br>
[51 ] The tAG (target AG) 210 is an AG to which the terminal is going to move after<br>
moving to a teNB 300, and the seNB 310 is a base station node with which the<br>
terminal has been connected to receive the service. The terminal is allocated radio<br>
resources via the base station and receives traffic through a radio interface. If the<br>
terminal wants to move from the seNB 300 to the teNB 310, it is disconnected from<br>
the seNB 300 and is newly connected with the teNB 310 (namely, it cuts off its<br>
connection with the seNB and makes a new connection with the teNB). In this case,<br>
the teNB basically has an interface (X2) connected with the seNB 300, through which<br>
a packet transmission can be performed between the eNBs. One eNB can perform<br>
packet transmission on several AGs through an interface (S1).<br>
[52] FIG. 5 shows an example of traffic (e.g., packet) transmission between the eNBs<br>
when the terminal moves from the seNB 300 to the teNB 310. As shown in FIG. 5,<br>
when the terminal moves from the seNB 300 to the teNB 310, a packet transmission is<br>
performed between the seNB 300 and the teNB 310 until when handover is completed,<br>
as the teNB 310 receives handover completion information after the seNB 300<br>
transmits a handover command to the terminal.<br>
[53] FIG. 6 is a view showing traffic transmission from the sAG 200 to the teNB 310<br>
when the terminal moves from the seNB 300 to the teNB 310. FIG. 6 shows a case<br>
7<br>
WO 2007/024112 PCT/KR2006/003340<br>
where when the terminal, upon completion of handover, moves to the teNB 310, a path<br>
from the sAG 200 is updated so that traffic can be transmitted directly to the teNB, not<br>
to the seNB.<br>
[54] FIG. 7 shows a traffic transmission when the terminal moves from the seNB 300 to<br>
the teNB 310, but there is no path between the sAG 200 and the teNB 310. In FIG. 7,<br>
when the terminal moves from the seNB 300 to the teNB 310, but an immediate<br>
connection is not possible because there is no path from the sAG 200 directly to the<br>
teNB 310 or due to other problems, traffic transmission should be made via the tAG<br>
210 to which the teNB 310 can be connected.<br>
[55] In the cases as shown in FIGs. 6 and 7, because traffic may be transmitted to the<br>
terminal via another path than an optimum path, additional traffic transmission delays<br>
may occurs. Also, a problem may arise with respect to the traffic transmission<br>
according to a traffic load or capacity of the sAG, etc.<br>
[56] Thus, as shown in FIG. 8, a gateway (namely, 'tAG') that is most suitable for the<br>
eNB to which the terminal is being connected with, should be relocated to transmit<br>
traffic via an optimized path.<br>
[57] FIG. 8 shows an example of relocating an optimum AG to the teNB 310 and<br>
transmitting traffic, when the terminal moves from the seNB 300 to the teNB 310.<br>
[58] FIG. 9 shows a method for optimizing a packet transmission path via an AG<br>
relocation, and particularly, shows a method for relocating the AG in the process of<br>
traffic transmission as shown in FIGs. 6 and 7.<br>
[59] With reference to FIG. 9, the terminal is in a state of receiving or transmitting<br>
traffic in an active mode. When handover is being performed as the terminal moves<br>
from the seNB to the teNB, the terminal receives traffic through the seNB (FIG. 5:<br>
Inter AS (100) -&gt; sAG (200) -&gt; seNB (300) -&gt; teNB (310) -&gt; terminal).<br>
[60] When handover is completed, the terminal may receive traffic directly from the<br>
teNB through the sAG (FIG. 6: Inter AG (100) -&gt; sAG (200) -&gt; teNB (310) -&gt;<br>
terminal), or may receive traffic through the tAG, namely, a new AG (FIG. 7: Inter AS<br>
(100) -&gt; sAG (200) -&gt; tAG (210) -&gt; teNB (310) -&gt; terminal).<br>
[61] Accordingly, first, the teNB 310 may check an activity of the terminal, namely, a<br>
state of traffic transmission or reception. In this case, the terminal may be in an active<br>
mode in which it transmits or receives traffic or in a quasi-active mode in which it is in<br>
an active state but transmits or receives little traffic or does not transmit or receive any<br>
traffic. The quasi-active mode is similar to an idle mode, but different from the idle<br>
mode in that the terminal is present and sustained in the eNB to which UE context of<br>
the terminal is connected. Herein, it is assumed that the terminal, which has transmitted<br>
and received traffic in the active mode, has been changed to be in the quasi-active<br>
mode as the traffic transmission and reception is suspended. When the terminal is<br>
8<br>
WO 2007/024112 PCT/KR2006/003340<br>
checked to be in the quasi-active mode, the teNB 310 determines the most valid AG<br>
(e.g., the tAG) (which can be determined in terms of an operator in consideration of<br>
characteristics such as traffic path optimization, a traffic load and a user load, etc.) and<br>
transmits an AG relocation request message to the tAG 210 (step S10).<br>
[62] The AG relocation request message may include UE context or the like with respect<br>
to the terminal. The UE context information may include authentication information,<br>
security information and compression-related information. Additional UE context in-<br>
formation, as well as other types of information may be included in the AG relocation<br>
request message. In this case, the terminal may be changed to the idle mode or can be<br>
maintained in the quasi-active mode. For this purpose, the teNB 310 may transmit a<br>
request message for changing or maintaining the terminal state to the terminal.<br>
[63] When the tAG 210 receives the AG relocation request message from the teNB 310,<br>
it transmits an AG path optimization request message to the sAG (step S11). In this<br>
case, the AG path optimization message may include the UE context information and<br>
identification information, or may include the authentication information and the<br>
security information as necessary.<br>
[64] Upon receiving the AG path optimization request message, the sAG 200 may<br>
transmit an AG path optimization response message containing the context information<br>
such as the authentication information and the security information with respect to the<br>
terminal to the tAG (step S12). As the tAG 210 receives the AG path optimization<br>
response message, it may register or attach the terminal into its terminal list (which is<br>
managed by the tAG itself). The sAG 200 may delete or detach the context information<br>
with respect to the terminal or de-list the terminal from its terminal list that manages it.<br>
Or, the sAG may keep a portion or the entirety of the UE context information.<br>
[65] The sAG 200 requests the Inter-AS 100 or a server related to distribution of traffic<br>
or providing of a service within the network to change the path for a traffic<br>
transmission from the terminal to the tAG 210, instead of to the sAG 200, through a<br>
path switching message (step S13).<br>
[66] Upon receiving the path switching message, the Inter-AS 100 may check the traffic<br>
situation such as (a traffic load, etc), switches the traffic transmission path with respect<br>
to the service, and starts traffic transmission for the terminal through the tAG 210,<br>
instead of through the sAG 200. Accordingly, the traffic is directly transmitted to the<br>
teNB 310 from the Inter-AS 100 via the tAG 210 so as to be provided to the terminal<br>
through an optimized path. Also, the traffic transmission path may change when the<br>
traffic load condition is substantially changed (i.e., when the traffic load is greater than<br>
predetermined threshold value) again even after the traffic transmission path has been<br>
previously established.<br>
[67] An AG relocation request through a late path switching will be described in detail<br>
9<br>
WO 2007/024112 PCT/KR2006/003340<br>
with reference to FIG. 10.<br>
[68] The basic assumptions and processes in FIG. 10 follow the processes of FIG. 9.<br>
Namely, a first step and a second step of FIG. 9 are performed same in FIG. 10. In a<br>
third step, the tAG 210 may receive the AG path optimization response message and<br>
confirms the AG path optimization request. In a fourth step, the tAG 210 may transmit<br>
the path switching message to the Inter-AS 100 following the reception of the AG path<br>
optimization request. Upon receiving the path switching message, the Inter-AS 100<br>
may check the traffic situation (such as the traffic load, etc.), may switch the traffic<br>
transmission path with respect to the service and starts traffic transmission for the<br>
terminal via the tAG 210, not via the sAG 200. Accordingly, the traffic may be<br>
transmitted to the tAG 210 via the Inter-AS 100 and then immediately transmitted to<br>
the teNB 310, thereby being provided to the terminal via an optimized path.<br>
[69] FIGs. 11 and 12 show the AG relocation process through the terminal.<br>
[70] In FIGs. 11 and 12, the terminal (UE) 410 has been moved from the seNB 300 to<br>
the teNB 310 and receives network-related information or system information via the<br>
teNB 310. The network-related information may include an identifier for identifying an<br>
area or a node, etc. managed by the network. Because the terminal has been moved<br>
from a network (of which it originally belongs) to a different network, it is presently<br>
located in the different network so the identifier included in the received network-<br>
related information is different from the previous identifier. Upon checking the<br>
identifier, the terminal transmits an AG relocation request message to the teNB in<br>
order to inform the network (teNB) that it has newly moved into the network and thus<br>
requires setting of a new path. When the teNB 310 receives the AG relocation request<br>
message, it transmits the AG relocation request message to the tAG 210 to inform that<br>
the terminal registration and AG relocation are necessary.<br>
[71] Upon receiving the AG relocation request message, the tAG 210 transmits the AG<br>
path optimization request message to the sAG 200. Upon receiving the AG path op-<br>
timization request message from the tAG 210, the sAG 200 transmits a response to the<br>
AG path optimization request message to the tAG 210.<br>
[72] In FIG. 11, after the sAG 200 receives the AG path optimization request message, it<br>
transmits the path switching message to the Inter-AS 100. In FIG. 12, after the tAG<br>
210 receives the response to the AG path optimization request message from the sAG<br>
200, it transmits the path switching message to the Inter-AS 100.<br>
[73] As so far described, when the mobile terminal 410 is connected to the second radio<br>
network node (teNB) 310 in a state that it had been connected with the first radio<br>
network node (seNB) 300, the gateway most suitable for the second radio network<br>
node is relocated to perform traffic transmission through an optimized path, whereby<br>
the congestion within the network and unnecessary signaling process generated in the<br>
10<br>
WO 2007/024112 PCT/KR2006/003340<br>
related art can be reduced.<br>
[74] Fig 13 is an exemplary construction view showing a mobile communications<br>
terminal according to the present invention.<br>
[75] As shown, the mobile communications terminal 500 may comprises a transceiver<br>
550 for transmitting and/or receiving data through a traffic path in a mobile com-<br>
munication system via a wireless link (Wi-Fi, Wi-MAX, Wi-bro, etc.) and the like; a<br>
storage unit 540 for storing the data transmitted or received via the transceiver or from<br>
an external source; a processor 510 for sending a request for an optimized traffic path,<br>
during or after performing handover from a source node B to a target node B, to the<br>
network that determines the optimized traffic path, and receiving the data through the<br>
optimized traffic path from the network.<br>
[76] As can be understood, other components exist within a mobile communications<br>
terminal, but such will not be discussed in detail to prevent the characteristics of the<br>
present invention from being obscured.<br>
[77] The present invention provides a method for relocating an access gateway (AG) in a<br>
mobile communications system having network entities and at least one terminal, the<br>
method comprising: sending a relocation request from a target Node B (e.g., teNB) to a<br>
target access gateway; sending a path optimization request from the target access<br>
gateway to a source access gateway; sending a path switching request from at least one<br>
of the target access gateway and the source access gateway to a higher entity; es-<br>
tablishing, by the higher entity, a optimized path to transfer data between the terminal<br>
and the higher entity; re-establishing the optimized path when the traffic load condition<br>
is substantially changed; sending, by the target node B, network related information<br>
and/or system information to the terminal, and the network related information<br>
includes an identifier to define a domain and/or a node managed by a network; sending<br>
a request to the terminal for changing or maintaining a terminal state; sending a<br>
response for the path optimization request from the source access gateway to the target<br>
access gateway; adding a terminal into a list of the target access gateway based on the<br>
response received by the target access gateway, and/or removing a terminal from a list<br>
of the source access gateway based on the response received by the target access<br>
gateway; wherein the relocation request is an AG relocation request message, the path<br>
optimization request is an AG path optimization request message, and the path<br>
switching response is an AG path switching message; wherein the higher entity (e.g.,<br>
higher node, Inter-AS) determines the optimized path based upon a traffic load<br>
condition, which is determined by at least one of a traffic overload situation, a user<br>
overload situation and a capacity of the access gateways; wherein at least one of the<br>
source access gateway and the target access gateway includes information about the<br>
terminal related to at least one of authentication information, security information,<br>
11<br>
WO 2007/024112 PCT/KR2006/003340<br>
compression-related information, service information, and Tracking Area (TA) in-<br>
formation; wherein the steps are performed if the terminal is in Quasi-active mode;<br>
wherein the relocation request includes information about the terminal related to at<br>
least one of authentication information, security information, compression-related in-<br>
formation, service information, and Tracking Area (TA) information; wherein the path<br>
optimization request includes at least one of a terminal context, identification in-<br>
formation, authentication information and security information.<br>
[78] Also, the present invention provides a method for relocating an access gateway<br>
(AG) in a mobile communications system, the method comprising: determining<br>
whether a traffic path is needed to be relocated; detecting a terminal mode if a<br>
relocation of the traffic path is necessary; and sending a mode transition request to the<br>
terminal if the terminal is in an active mode or establishing an optimized traffic path if<br>
the terminal is in an inactive mode; wherein the inactive mode is at least one of a Quasi<br>
active mode and an Idle mode.<br>
[79] Further, the present invention provides a method performed by a terminal for<br>
relocating an access gateway (AG) in a mobile communications system, the method<br>
comprising: sending a request, to a target node B, for an optimized traffic path, during<br>
or after performing handover from a source Node B (NB) to a target node B, to the<br>
network that determines the optimized traffic path by, sending a relocation request<br>
from a target NB to a target access gateway; sending a path optimization request from<br>
the target access gateway to a source access gateway; sending a path switching request<br>
from at least one of the target access gateway and source access gateway to a higher<br>
entity; and establishing, by the higher entity, a optimized traffic path to transfer data;<br>
and receiving a data through the optimized traffic path from the network; wherein the<br>
sending step is performed if the terminal is in non-active mode; wherein the higher<br>
entity is a network node or an Inter-Autonomous System (Inter-AS).<br>

nications, the present invention may also be used in any wireless communication<br>
systems using mobile devices, such as PDAs and laptop computers equipped with<br>
