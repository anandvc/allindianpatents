				<td>EXHAUST SYSTEM FOR AN ENGINE AND MOTORCYCLE INCLUDING THE<br>
EXHAUST SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an exhaust system<br>
for an engine including an exhaust pipe connected to the<br>
engine and a muffler connected to the exhaust pipe, and a<br>
motorcycle including the exhaust system.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
It is required for an exhaust system for a motorcycle<br>
that an exhaust sound is reduced as mush as possible. To<br>
meet this request, it is effective to separate the inside<br>
of a muffler into a plurality of expansion chambers and<br>
communicatively connect the expansion chambers by a<br>
plurality of communicative pipe, and thereby damps<br>
exhaust energy and reduces an exhaust sound.<br>
However, there is a problem that with the<br>
construction such that a plurality of communicative pipes<br>
is disposed in a muffler, a weight of the muffler<br>
increases as a number of the pipes, and it deteriorates a<br>
traveling performance.<br>
In consideration of the problem, JP-A-6-264741<br>
suggests a muffler for a motorcycle in which a space is<br>
formed by disposing an inner cylinder with a small<br>
1<br><br>
diameter in an outer cylinder, a small pipe part is<br>
formed in a manner such that the small pipe concaves<br>
inside in the inner cylinder, and a sound absorbing<br>
member such as glass wool fills the space.<br>
In the above conventional construction, a weight of<br>
the muffler can be reduced. However, because the space<br>
is communicatively connected to the small pipe part,<br>
glass wool filled in the space scatters outside by<br>
passing through the small pipe part, and exhaust gas<br>
enters the space from the small pipe part. Exhaust sound<br>
tends to leak outside from there, and thus a silencing<br>
effect may not be obtained satisfactorily.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is made in consideration of the<br>
foregoing circumstance. The object of the present<br>
invention is to provide an exhaust system for an engine<br>
such that a weight of a muffler can be reduced and a<br>
silencing effect can be assured to prevent leak of<br>
exhaust sound, and a motorcycle including the exhaust<br>
system.<br>
The aspects of the present invention provide an<br>
exhaust system for an engine, including: an engine; an<br>
exhaust pipe connected to the engine; and a muffler<br>
connected to the exhaust pipe, in which the muffler has<br>
2<br><br>
an outer cylinder and an inner cylinder disposed in the<br>
outer cylinder, and is separated into a plurality of<br>
expansion chambers, a communicative passage for<br>
communicatively connecting the expansion chambers is<br>
formed between the outer cylinder and the inner cylinder,<br>
and both edge parts of a part constructing the<br>
communicative passage of the inner cylinder contact the<br>
outer cylinder and are welded thereto.<br>
Here, disposing the inner cylinder in the outer<br>
cylinder includes both cases that the inner cylinder is<br>
disposed in the outer cylinder with a space between them,<br>
and that the inner cylinder is disposed in the outer<br>
cylinder in a manner such that the inner cylinder abuts<br>
against or firmly contacts an inner peripheral surface of<br>
the outer cylinder.<br>
In the exhaust system according to the present<br>
invention, a communicative passage for communicatively<br>
connecting the expansion chambers is formed between the<br>
outer cylinder and the inner cylinder. Both the edge<br>
parts of the part of the inner cylinder constructing the<br>
communicative passage contact the outer cylinder and are<br>
welded thereto. Consequently, exhaust gas flowing in the<br>
communicative passage does not enter the space between<br>
the inner cylinder and the outer cylinder. Therefore, an<br>
exhaust sound does not leak outside from the space<br>
3<br><br>
between both the cylinders, and a silencing effect can be<br>
assured.<br>
The communicative passage formed between the outer<br>
cylinder and the inner cylinder communicatively connects<br>
the expansion chambers. Thus, a communicative pipe<br>
conventionally used is not necessary, and a weight of the<br>
muffler and a cost for the muffler can be reduced.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
An embodiment of the present invention will be<br>
described with reference to the attached drawings<br>
hereinafter.<br>
FIGs. 1 through 6 are drawings for describing an<br>
exhaust system for an engine according to the first<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Here, front, rear,<br>
right, and left in this embodiment mean the front, the<br>
rear, the right, and the left in the view of a driver<br>
sitting on a seat.<br>
In the figure, a reference numeral 1 shows a<br>

embodiment. This motorcycle 1 includes a diamond-shaped<br>
vehicle body frame 2, an engine 3 mounted on the vehicle<br>
body frame 2, and an exhaust system 50 connected to the<br>
engine 3.<br>
A front fork 5 is supported steerably in the<br>
transverse direction by a head pipe 4 disposed at a front<br>
end of the vehicle body frame 2. A front wheel 6 is<br>
disposed at a bottom end of the front fork 5. Steering<br>
handlebars (not shown) are disposed at a top end of the<br>
front fork 5.<br>
5<br><br>
A rear arm 7 is supported swingably in the vertical<br>
direction at a lower part of a rear end of the vehicle<br>
frame 2. A rear wheel 8 is disposed at a rear end of the<br>
rear arm 7.<br>
A fuel tank 9 is disposed above the engine 3 of the<br>
vehicle body frame 2. A straddle type seat 10 is<br>
disposed on a rear side of the fuel tank 9.<br>
The vehicle body frame 2 has a down tube 11 extending<br>
obliquely downward from a lower part of the head pipe 4,<br>
an upper tube 12 having a tank rail part 12a extending<br>
rearward form an upper part of the head pipe 4 and a rear<br>
arm supporting part 12b curvedly extending rearward from<br>
a rear end of the tank rail part 12a, and a seat rail 13<br>
extending obliquely upward and rearward from the rear arm<br>
supporting part 12b.<br>
The engine 3 is an air-cooled four cycle single<br>
cylinder engine mounted on with its cylinder axis<br>
inclining forward, laid over the down tube 11 and the<br>
upper tube 12 and connected there, and constructs a part<br>
of the vehicle body frame 2.<br>
An intake system is connected to the engine 3. The<br>
intake system has an intake pipe 16 connected to a rear<br>
wall 15a of a cylinder head 15 of the engine 3, a<br>
throttle body 17 containing a throttle valve 17a<br>
connected to the intake pipe 16 inside, an air cleaner<br>
6<br><br>
(not shown) connected to the throttle body 17.<br>
The exhaust system 50 has an exhaust pipe 20<br>
connected to a front wall 15b of the cylinder head 15 of<br>
the engine 3, and a muffler 21 connected to a downstream<br>
end of the exhaust pipe 20.<br>
The exhaust pipe 20 is disposed on a right side of<br>
the vehicle body frame 2. The exhaust pipe 20 has an<br>
exhaust pipe main body 20', and bifurcating branches 20d,<br>
20d connected to a rear end of the exhaust pipe main body<br>
20' . Viewing from the lateral side of the vehicle, the<br>
exhaust pipe main body 20' has an upstream exhaust part<br>
20a extending downward from the front wall 15b of the<br>
cylinder head 15, a downstream exhaust part 20b extending<br>
rearward from a rear end of the upstream exhaust part 20a<br>
passing through a part below the engine 3, and a rear<br>
inclining part 20c extending obliquely upward and<br>
rearward from a rear end of the downstream exhaust part<br>
20b. The rear inclining part 20c (downstream end)<br>
bifurcates up and down into the bifurcating branches 20d,<br>
20d.<br>
A metal honeycomb type catalyst 22 for cleaning up<br>
exhaust gas is disposed in the rear inclining part 20c.<br>
The muffler 21 has two muffler main bodies 23, 23<br>
arranged in parallel with the upper and the lower bodies.<br>
The bifurcating branches 20d, 20d are inserted in the<br>
7<br><br>
respective upper and lower muffler main bodies 23, 23,<br>
and fixed there.<br>
A protector 25 functioning as a thermal insulation<br>
member covers a part positioned outside in vehicle's<br>
width direction through an upper part of the upper<br>
muffler main body 23. The rear inclining part 20c of<br>
the exhaust pipe 20, the upper and lower bifurcating<br>
branches 20d, 20d, and a part where each bifurcating<br>
branch 20d connects to the muffler main body 23 are<br>
disposed outside in vehicle's width direction, and a<br>
generally triangular protector 26 functioning as a<br>
thermal insulation member covers them.<br>
The upper and lower muffler main bodies 23, 23 are<br>
united into one body by a bracket 24 disposed inside in<br>
vehicle's width direction. An attachment part 24a<br>
protruding upward from the upper muffler main body 23 is<br>
formed on the bracket 24. This attachment part 24a is<br>
fixed by bolting to a tandem foot bracket 25 mounted on a<br>
bottom surface of the seat rail 13.<br>
A center of gravity G of the exhaust system 50<br>
according to this embodiment is positioned at a front<br>
edge part of the muffler 21. An attachment part 24a of<br>
the bracket 24 is disposed to be in a vicinity of the<br>
rear part of this center of gravity G (see FIG. 1).<br>
The muffler 21 is disposed to be placed on a front<br>
8<br><br>
side in a vehicle from a perpendicular line (a) passing<br>
through a rotational center 8a of the rear wheel 8. The<br>
muffler 21 is disposed obliquely upward to extend<br>
generally along the seat rail 13 on a right side of the<br>
rear wheel 8. Viewing from the lateral side of the<br>
vehicle, the muffler 21 is disposed in a manner such that<br>
a major part of the muffler 21 falls in a projection area<br>
of the rear wheel 8. In other words, a top edge part 21a<br>
of a rear end of the muffler 21 generally corresponds to<br>
the perpendicular line (a) in a top rim part of the rear<br>
wheel 8. A top edge part 21b of a front end generally<br>
corresponds to a front rim part of the rear wheel 8.<br>
The upper and lower muffler main bodies 23, 23 have<br>
respective cylindrically shaped outer cylinders 30, and<br>
also cylindrically shaped inner cylinders inserted into<br>
the outer cylinders.<br>
An upstream opening 30a of the outer cylinder 30 is<br>
blocked with a generally plate-shaped partition 32. The<br>
bifurcating branch 20d passes through the partition 32<br>
and extends to a vicinity of a center part inside the<br>
outer cylinder 30.<br>
A downstream end opening 30b is blocked with a<br>
generally bowl-shaped partition 33. A double wall tail<br>
cap 34 is removably fixed to a rear part of the partition<br>
33 by a plurality of bolts 35. Two spaces b, b formed<br>
9<br><br>
between the tail cap 34 and the partition 33 inhibit an<br>
increase of temperature of the tail part.<br>
A tail pipe 36 for communicatively connecting an<br>
inside of the muffler main body 23 with an outside is<br>
disposed to pass through the partition 33 and fixed there.<br>
This tail pipe 36 is disposed to be generally horizontal<br>
in a state that it is mounted on the vehicle, passes<br>
through the tail cap 34, and opens rearward.<br>
The inner cylinder 31 is disposed at a center part<br>
except for a front end and a rear end in an axis<br>
direction of the outer cylinder 30, and contacts with an<br>
inner peripheral surface of the outer cylinder 30.<br>
An upstream end opening 31a of the inner cylinder 31<br>
opens to communicatively connect with a front part of the<br>
outer cylinder 30. A downstream end opening 31b is<br>
blocked with a generally plate-shaped partition 38.<br>
A punched partition 39 is disposed at a center in an<br>
axis direction inside the inner cylinder 31. A large<br>
number of through holes 39a for communicatively<br>
connecting spaces inside the inner cylinder 31 is formed<br>
on the punched partition 39 (see FIG. 6(b)).<br>
The partition 38 of the inner cylinder 31 divides an<br>
inside of the muffler main body 23 into a first expansion<br>
chamber (A) on a front side of the partition 38 and a<br>
second expansion chamber (B) on a rear side of the<br>
10<br><br>
partition 38.<br>
A communicative passage 40 for communicatively<br>
connecting the first expansion chamber (A) and the second<br>
expansion chamber (B) is formed between the outer<br>
cylinder 30 and the inner cylinder 31.<br>
The communicative passage 40 is formed in a manner<br>
such that a bottom part 31c of the inner cylinder 31 is<br>
concaved from the inner peripheral surface of the outer<br>
cylinder 30 in a direction to a center (e) of the outer<br>
cylinder. Specifically, the bottom part 31c is an arc-<br>
shaped part with a radius of curvature R larger than a<br>
radius of curvature r of the outer cylinder 30. Thereby,<br>
a horizontal cross section of the communicative passage<br>
40 has an arc shape.<br>
A large number of weight reducing holes 31d is formed<br>
by punching (see FIG. 4) over a generally entire surface<br>
of a contacting part c where the inner cylinder 31 except<br>
for the bottom part 31c contacts the outer cylinder 30<br>
(see FIG. 6(a)) .<br>
Contacting parts 40a, 40a where right and left edge<br>
parts 31e, 31e of the bottom part 31c of the inner<br>
cylinder 31, which structures the communicative passage<br>
40, contact with the inner peripheral surface of the<br>
outer cylinder 30 are welded over an entire length in the<br>
axis direction by spot welding or arc welding.<br>
11<br><br>
Exhaust gas exhausted from the engine 3 flows inside<br>
the exhaust pipe 20, and is cleaned up when it flows<br>
through the catalyst 22 of the rear inclining part 20c.<br>
From here, the gas separately flows into the top and<br>
bottom bifurcating branches 20d, 20d and flows in each of<br>
the muffler main bodies 23, 23.<br>
Exhaust gas flowed into the first expansion chamber A<br>
of each muffler main body 23, 23 passes through the<br>
punched partition 39 inside the inner cylinder 31, meets<br>
the partition 38 positioned at a rear end, and there<br>
makes a U-turn frontward. The gas flows inside the<br>
communicative passage 40 rearward from the front end of<br>
the outer cylinder 30, and then flows into the second<br>
expansion chamber B. The gas is discharged outside by<br>
passing through the tail pipe 36 (see the arrows in FIG.<br>
4) .<br>
In this embodiment, the muffler main body 23 is<br>
constructed with the outer cylinder 30 and the inner<br>
cylinder 31 contacting the inner peripheral surface of<br>
the outer cylinder 30. The communicative passage 40 for<br>
communicatively connecting the first expansion chamber A<br>
and the second expansion chamber B together is formed<br>
between the inner cylinder 31 and the outer cylinder 30.<br>
Also, the right and left edge parts 31e, 31e of the part<br>
of the inner cylinder 31, which constructs the<br>
12<br><br>
communicative passage, are welded to the contacting parts<br>
40a, 40a on the outer cylinder 30. As a result, exhaust<br>
gas flowing in the communicative passage 40 does not<br>
enter the space between the inner cylinder 31 and the<br>
outer cylinder 30. Therefore, an exhaust sound does not<br>
leak from the space between both the cylinders 30 and 31,<br>
and thereby a silencing effect can be assured.<br>
The first and second expansion chambers A, B are<br>
communicatively connected together by the communicative<br>
passage 40 formed between the outer cylinder 30 and the<br>
inner cylinder 31. Thus, a conventional communicative<br>
pipe is not necessary, and a weight of the muffler and a<br>
cost for the muffler can be reduced.<br>
In this embodiment, the communicative passage 40 is<br>
formed in a manner such that a bottom part 31c of the<br>
inner cylinder 31 is concaved from the inner peripheral<br>
surface of the outer cylinder 30 in a direction to a<br>
center (e) of the outer cylinder 30. Therefore, without<br>
processing the outer cylinder 30, the communicative<br>
passage 40 can be formed with a simple structure such<br>
that the bottom part 31c of the inner cylinder 31 is only<br>
deformed inside. This results in a prevention of cost<br>
increase and deterioration of an appearance.<br>
In this embodiment, the communicative passage 40 is<br>
constructed in a manner such that the bottom part 31c of<br>
13<br><br>
the inner cylinder 31 is an arc-shaped part having the<br>
radius of curvature R larger than the radius of curvature<br>
r of the outer cylinder 30. That is, the bottom part 31c<br>
is not flat but arc-shaped. Therefore, a shell sound can<br>
be prevented while a necessary passage area can be<br>
assured.<br>
In this embodiment, a large number of the weight<br>
reducing holes 31d is formed on the contacting part c<br>
where the inner cylinder 31 except for the bottom part<br>
31c contacts the outer cylinder 30, and thus a weight of<br>
the muffler main body 23 can be reduced more.<br>
In this embodiment, the muffler 21 has two muffler<br>
main bodies 23, 23 arranged in parallel with the upper<br>
and lower main bodies. Thereby, the vehicle has a<br>
powerful appearance although the engine is a single<br>
cylinder engine.<br>
The bifurcating branches 20d, 20d of the single<br>
exhaust pipe 20 are connected to the respective muffler<br>
main bodies 23, 23. Thereby, engine output in medium and<br>
high-speed ranges is maintained, and also engine output<br>
in low and medium speed ranges can be improved. In a<br>
performance simulation study, engine output is improved<br>
by 10% in a range between 2500 rpm and 4000 rpm comparing<br>
with an engine having one muffler main body.<br>
In this embodiment, the muffler 21 is disposed to be<br>
14<br><br>
on a front side in a vehicle from a perpendicular line<br>
(a) passing through a rotational center 8a of the rear<br>
wheel 8. Consequently, the center of gravity G of the<br>
exhaust system 50 can be positioned closer to a center of<br>
gravity of the vehicle, thereby, mass is concentrated,<br>
and operational stability can be improved.<br>
The attachment part 24a of the muffler 21 is disposed<br>
in the vicinity of the rear part of the center of gravity<br>
G. The exhaust system 50 can be attached to the vehicle<br>
body frame 2 at a single place. This can improve an<br>
assemblage characteristic and results in a cost reduction.<br>
FIGs. 7 and 8 are figures for describing the exhaust<br>
system according to a second embodiment of the present<br>
invention. In the figure, the reference numerals and<br>
symbols the same as in FIG. 4 show the same or equivalent<br>
parts.<br>
The exhaust system of this embodiment includes a<br>
muffler 45. The muffler 45 has the outer cylinder 30 and<br>
the inner cylinder 31 inserted in the outer cylinder 30<br>
in a manner such that the inner cylinder 31 contacts the<br>
inner peripheral surface of the outer cylinder 30. An<br>
inside of the muffler 45 is separated into first, second,<br>
and third expansion chambers A, B, and C by two<br>
partitions 46 and 47.<br>
The first expansion chamber A and the second<br>
15<br><br>
expansion chamber B are communicatively connected<br>
together by a first communicative passage 48 formed<br>
between the outer cylinder 30 and the inner cylinder 31.<br>
The second expansion chamber B and the third expansion<br>
chamber C are communicatively connected together by a<br>
second communicative passage 49 formed between the outer<br>
cylinder 30 and the inner cylinder 31. A basic<br>
construction is generally the same as the first<br>
embodiment.<br>
The first communicative passage 48 and the second<br>
communicative passage 49 are formed in such a manner that<br>
a bottom part 31g and a side part 31f of the inner<br>
cylinder 31 are deformed to form arcs whose centers of<br>
curvatures d and d' , respectively, are positioned closer<br>
to the center e of the outer cylinder 30 than to the<br>
inner peripheral surface of the outer cylinder 31. In<br>
other words, those communicative passages are formed in a<br>
manner such that the bottom part 31g and the side part<br>
31f are concaved so that each of them forms an arc inside.<br>
These bottom part 31g and side part 31f form a generally<br>
cylindrical ring part f.<br>
Both edge parts of the bottom part 31g and the side<br>
part 31f of the inner cylinder 31, which form the first<br>
and second communicative passages 48 and 49, contact the<br>
inner peripheral surface of the outer cylinder 30 at<br>
16<br><br>
contacting parts 48a, 48a and 49a, 49a. These contacting<br>
parts 48a, 48a and 49a, 49a are welded over an entire<br>
length in an axis direction by spot welding or arc<br>
welding.<br>
Exhaust gas passes through inside the exhaust pipe 20<br>
and flows into the first expansion chamber A in the<br>
muffler 45. The gas meets the partition 46 and there<br>
makes a U-turn frontward. Then, the gas flows rearward<br>
in the communicative passage 48 and flows into the second<br>
expansion chamber B. Form here, the gas flows frontward<br>
inside the second communicative passage 49 and flows into<br>
the third expansion chamber C. The gas flows out from<br>
the third expansion chamber C passing through the tail<br>
pipe 36, and is discharged outside (see the arrows in FIG.<br>
7) .<br>
According to this embodiment, the muffler 45 is<br>
constructed with the outer cylinder 30 and the inner<br>
cylinder 31 contacting the inner peripheral surface of<br>
the outer cylinder 30. The first communicative passage<br>
48 for communicatively connecting the first and second<br>
expansion chambers A and B, and the second communicative<br>
passage 49 for communicatively connecting the second and<br>
third expansion chambers B and C are formed between the<br>
inner cylinder 31 and the outer cylinder 30. The first<br>
and second communicative passages 48 and 49 are formed in<br>
17<br><br>
a manner such that the contacting parts 48a and 49a where<br>
the inner cylinder 31 contactes the outer cylinder 30 are<br>
welded. Thereby, a silencing function can be assured<br>
while reducing a weight. Therefore, an effect generally<br>
equivalent to the first embodiment can be obtained.<br>
