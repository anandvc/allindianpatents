Process for the Preparation of Paliperidone<br>
Field of the Invention:<br>
The  present   invention   relates  to   a  novel  process   for  the   preparation  of paliperidone. Paliperidone is chemically known as 3-[2-[4-(6-fluoro-l,2-benzisoxazol-3-yl)piperidin-I-yl]ethyl]-6,7,8,9terahydro-9-hydroxy-2-methyl-4H-pyrido-[l,2-a] pyrimidin-4-one, which is represented by formula-1. It also relates to an improved process for the preparation of paliperidone.<br>
 <br>
Paliperidone is an active metabolite of risperidone, widely prescribed antipsychotic drug used for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Paliperidone marketed under the name InvegaÂ® acts as a dual antagonist of dopamine D2 receptors in the mesolimbic pathway and 5-HT2A receptors in the prefrontal cortex. Its ability to bind to these receptors in corresponds with its antipsychotic effect and stabilization of some of the antisocial behaviors in patients with schizophrenia. It has been approved in the United States for the treatment of schizophrenia.<br>
Background of the Invention:<br>
Paliperidone is an active metabolite of risperidone. Risperidone is metabolized by cytochrome P-450 IID6 to produce 9-hydroxy-risperidone also known as paliperidone. EP 196132 Bl and US Patent No 4804663 describe certain l,2-benzisoxazol-3-yl derivatives having psychotic and anti-serotonin activity including 3-[2-[4-(6-fluoro-l,2-benzisoxazol-3'yl)piperidin-l-yl]ethyl]-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-2-methyl-4H-pyrido-[l,2-a] pyrimidin-4-one (Risperidone) which is a mixed 5-HTVD2-receptor antagonist and a typical neuroleptic drug. They exemplify the process for the preparation of risperidone, which includes the condensation of 3-(2-chloroethyl)-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-2-methyl-4H-<br>
 <br>
pyrido[l,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one mono hydrochloride and 6-fluoro-3-{4-piperidinyl)-l,2-benzisoxazole in presence of N,N-dimethylformamide, sodium carbonate and catalytic amount of potassium iodide. The crude risperidone was crystallized from a mixture of DMF and isopropanol. 9-hydroxyrisperidone, its enantiomeric forms and the C2-20 alkanoic acid esters thereof are described in EP 0,368,388. Said esters are considered to be potentially valuable prodrugs of paliperidone.<br>
Risperidone is a highly potent drug having a relatively narrow therapeutic index. It may produce undesirable side effects on over dosage most notably extrapyramidal side effects such as tardive dyskinesia. The most frequently observed adverse reactions include orthostatic hypotension and dizziness, drowsiness, palpitations, weight gain, erectile dysfunction, and a significant increase in rashes and rhinitis. Accordingly, an antipsychotic agent having the efficacy of risperidone, but causing fewer side effects, would be desirable. It would be desirable to find a compound that has the advantages of risperidone while providing a more predictable dosage regimen in the patient population and decreasing the chances for drug-drug interactions.<br>
Paliperidone was found to overcome some of the problems associated with risperidone. It possesses a longer elimination half life. It has a potent activity in the treatment of psychotic disorders and other conditions, including those that would benefit from an anti diarrheal, an inhibitor of gastroesophageal reflux and /or an anti emetic, especially in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy and radiation. It is also used in combating autism, hypertension, vascular disorders, obesity, and the withdrawal symptoms associated with cessation of drinking and smoking. It provides a more predictable dosage regimen in the patient population and decreases the chances of drug-drug interactions by avoiding oxidative metabolism for which the cytochrome P4502D6 enzyme system is required.<br>
A process for the synthesis of paliperidone is described in US Patent No 5,158,952 according to scheme-1. The preparation of paliperidone via the intermediate 3-(2-chloroethyl)-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-9-hydroxy-2-methyl-4H-pyrido[l,2-a]pyrimidin-4-<br>
one (CMHTP) is depicted in the last step of the scheme.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
A process for the synthesis of intermediate 3-(2-chloroethyl)-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-9-hydroxy-2-methyI-4H-pyrido[l,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one (CMHTP) is also described in US Patent No 5,688,799. The processes described in the above publications are long, time consuming and result in low chemical yields, making their application in the industry very difficult.<br>

In step-a, the deprotection of the benzyl group is carried out by using an acid. The acid which can be used in the deprotection can be selected from hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid or sulfuric acid. In the preferred embodiment of the invention the acid used is hydrochloric acid. The 3-(2-chloroethyI)-9-hydroxy-2-methyl-4H-pyrido-[l,2-<br>
 <br>
a]pyrimidin-4-one formed is obtained as its hydrochloride salt compound of formula-5, which is of substantially high purity. This enhances the yields in the subsequent reactions.<br>
In the step-b, 3-(2-chloroethyl)-9-hydroxy-2-methyl-4H-pyrido-[l,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one hydrochloride is condensed with 6-fluoro-3-(4-piperidinyl)-l,2-benz- isoxazole monohydrochloride, compound of formula-6 in presence of sodium carbonate in acetonitrile, to provide 3-[2-[4-(6-ftuoro-l,2-benzisoxazol-3-yI) piperidin-l-yI]ethyl]-9-hydroxy-2-methyl-4H-pyrido-[l,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one, compound of formula-7.

In the step-c, the pyridine ring of 3-[2-[4-(6-fluoro-l,2-benzisoxazol-3-yl) piperidin-l-yl]ethyl]-9-hydroxy-2-methyl-4H-pyrido-[l,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one,   compound<br>
 <br>
of formula-7, is reduced by hydrogenation using palladium or platinum catalyst in acidic conditions. In the preferred embodiment the reaction was performed by hydrogenation using palladium catalyst in presence of acetic acid to provide paliperidone.<br>
The crude  paliperidone  formed in step-c,  is purified by crystallizing from isopropyl alcohol to obtain pure paliperidone. The present embodiment of the invention is represented in Scheme-2.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
The second embodiment of the present invention encompasses an improved process for the preparation of paliperidone, which comprises of the following steps:<br>
a)	Condensing 3-benzyloxy-2-aminopyridine, compound of formula-2 with 3-acetyldihydrofuran-2(3H)-2-one, compound of formula-3 in toluene to obtain a condensed compound of formula-4, which on in-situ treatment with acid, leading to deprotection of benzyl group to provide 3-(2-chloroethyl)-9-hydroxy-2-methyI-4H-pyrido-[l,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one, which is converted into hydrochloride salt, compound of formula-5,<br>
b)	reducing 3-(2-chIoroethyl)-9-hydroxy-2-methy]-4H-pyrido-[l,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one hydrochloride, compound of formula-5 by hydrogenation in the presence of palladium or platinum catalyst in acidic conditions to obtain 3-(2-chloroethyI)-9-hydroxy-2-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-4H-pyrido[ 1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one compound of formula-8,<br>
c)	condensing compound of formula-8 with 6-fluoro-3-(4-piperidinyl)-l,2-benz-isoxazole mo no hydrochloride, compound of formula-6 in presence of sodium carbonate in acetonitrile to obtain paliperidone,<br>
d)	purifying the crude paliperidone formed in step-c by crystallizing from isopropyl alcohol to obtain pure paliperidone.<br>
In step-a, the deprotection of the benzyl group is carried out by using an acid. The acid which can be used in the deprotection can be selected from hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid or sulfuric acid. In the preferred embodiment of the invention the acid used is hydrochloric acid- The 3-(2-chloroethyl)-9-hydroxy-2-methyl-4H-pyrido-[l,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one formed is obtained as its hydrochloride salt compound of formula-5.<br>
In the step-b, the pyridine ring of 3-(2-chloroethyl)-9-hydroxy-2-methyl-4H-pyrido-[l,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one hydrochloride, compound of formula-5 is reduced by hydrogenation using palladium or platinum catalyst in acidic conditions. In the preferred embodiment the reaction was performed by hydrogenation using palladium catalyst in presence of acetic acid to provide 3-(2-chloroethyl)-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-9-hydroxy-2-methyl-4H-pyrido[l,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one, compound of formula-8.<br>
 <br>
In the processes disclosed in the prior art the hydrogenation is performed in the presence of palladium catalyst in alcohol solvent, which to partially may lead to the hydrogenolysts of the chlorine atom which is replaced by hydrogen. The dehalogenated product does not undergo the condensation reaction in the next step, which leads to decrease in the purity and yields of the intermediates and it may be present as impurity.<br>
In the present invention the hydrogenation by palladium catalyst in acidic conditions prevents the dechlorination which increases the purity and yield of the intermediates, as well as the yield of the paliperidone formed.<br>
In step-c the condensation of 3-(2-chloroethyl)-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-9-hydroxy-2-methyl-4H-pyrido[l,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one, compound of formula-8 and 6-fluoro-3-(4-piperidinyl)-l,2-benzisoxazole mono hydrochloride, compound of formula-6 in presence of sodium carbonate and catalytic amount of potassium iodide in acetonitrile to provide paliperidone, which is purified in step-d, by crystallization from isopropyl alcohol.<br>
In the US Patent No 5,158,952 in the exemplified process the condensation step is carried out in the presence of organic base i.e., diisopropyl amine to provide paliperidone. But it also teaches that appropriate base such as for example, an alkali metal or alkaline metal carbonate, hydrogen carbonate, hydroxide, oxide, carboxylate, alkoxide hydride or amide e.g. sodium carbonate, sodium hydrogen carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium hydroxide etc: can be used for the condensation. The reaction can be carried out by mixing the reactants optionally in solvents such as aromatic solvents,C1-6 alcohols, ketones, an ester, an ether, a dipolar aprotic solvent e.g N,N-dimethyl formamide, N,N-dimethyl acetamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, pyridine, acetonitrile and the like; or a mixture of such solvents.<br>
In the prior art above condensation step has been disclosed for the synthesis of analogous compounds especially risperidone and its analogues. US Patent No 4804663 exemplifies the process for the preparation of risperidone, which includes the condensation of 3-(2-chloroethyl)-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-2-methyl-4H-pyrido[l,2-a]pyrimi-din-4-one    and    6-fluoro-3-(4-piperidinyl)-l,2-benzisoxazole    monohydrochloride    in<br>
 <br>
presence of N,N-dimethylformamide, sodium carbonate and catalytic amount of potassium iodide. The crude risperidone was crystallized from a mixture of DMF and isopropanol.<br>
A monograph in European pharmacopoeia on risperidone, lists five impurities and paliperidone is one of them. Thus in the synthesis of paliperidone there is a possibility of formation of the similar impurities reported for risperidone. The present invention is schematically represented in Scheme-3; Scheme-3<br>
