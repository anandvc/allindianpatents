				<td>PYROGENICALLY PREPARED, SURFACE MODIFIED ALUMINUM OXIDE<br>
Introduction and Background<br>
The present invention relates to a pyrogenically prepared, surface modified aluminum oxide<br>
and a process for the preparation thereof as well as the use thereof.<br>
Ceramic oxide particles, particularly silica, alumina, titania, and zirconia are known to have<br>
corona resistance properties. Sub-micron alumina is often used commercially in such (corona<br>
resistance) applications.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,308,312 to Urban teaches improved corona resistance using a film coating<br>
comprising alumina particles of a type "which provide a suspension which has an acid pH when the<br>
particles are slurried in distilled water."<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,760,296 to Johnston et al. teaches the use of unmodified ceramic oxide<br>
particles, organosilicates, or organoaluminates as wire insulation (corona resistant) filler and<br>
distinguishes these composite fillers from organosiloxane derivatives.<br>
Numerous temperature-resistant polymers, including polyimides, polyetherketones,<br>
polyelhersulfones and polyphthaiamides, have been considered for use as high voltage wire<br>
insulation. However, ceramic oxide fillers can be difficult, if not impractical or impossible, to<br>
efficiently and economically disperse into such polymers in sufficient quantities to achieve optimal<br>
desired corona resistance.<br>
An ineffective dispersion of (corona resistant) composite filler can result in inadequate<br>
corona resistance and/or diminished mechanical properties. A need therefore exists for a<br>
temperature resistant polymeric composition (for wire coatings or similar type applications) having<br>
excellent corona resistance and/or mechanical properties.<br><br>
It is known how to prepare pyrogenic aluminum oxide by means of high temperature or<br>
flame hydrolysis from AlCl3 [Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry], 4th edition,<br>
Volume 21, page 464 (1982).<br>
Pyrogenically prepared aluminum oxides are characterized by extremely fine particle size,<br>
high specific surface area (BET), very high purity, spherical particle shape, and the absence of<br>
pores. On account of these properties, pyrogenically prepared aluminum oxides are finding<br>
increasing interest as supports for catalysts (Dr. Koth et al., Chem. Ing. Techn. 52,628 (1980).<br>
It is known how to modify pyrogenically prepared aluminum oxide on its surface by means<br>
of a silane mixture (DE 42 09 964).<br>
In accordance with the document DE 42 09 964, the modification is carried out by spraying<br>
aluminum oxide with 0.5 to 40 parts by weight of a silane mixture per 100 parts by weight of<br>
aluminum oxide, the silane mixture consisting of 1 to 99 parts by weight of a silane of Formula A<br><br><br>
a surface area of 50 to 150 m2/g,<br>
a tamped density of 50 to 90 g/L,<br>
a drying loss of less than 5 %,<br>
a loss on ignition of 0.5 to 15 %,<br>
a C content of 0.5 to 12 % and<br>
a pH value of 4 to 8.<br>
The object of the present invention is a pyrogenically prepared, surface modified aluminum<br>
oxide, which is characterized by:<br>
Surface area [m2/g]	50 to 150<br>
Tamped density [g/L]	25 to 130<br>
Drying loss [%]	less man 5<br>
Loss on ignition [%]	0.1 to 15<br>
C content [%]	0.1 to 15<br>
pH value	3 to 9<br>
A further object of the invention is a process for the preparation of the pyrogenically<br>
prepared, surface modified aluminum oxide, which is characterized in that the pyrogenically<br>
prepared aluminum oxide is sprayed with a surface modifying agent, except for the mixture<br>
consisting of the silanes A and B in accordance with DE 42 02 694, at room temperature and the<br>
mixture is subsequently treated thermally at a temperature of 50 to 400 °C over a period of 1 to 6 h.<br>
An alternative method for surface modification of the pyrogenically prepared aluminum<br>
oxide can be carried out by treating the pyrogenic aluminum oxide with a surface modifying agent,<br>
except for the mixture consisting of the silanes A and B in accordance with DE 42 02 694, in vapor<br>
form and subsequently treating the mixture thermally at a temperature of 50 to 800 ºC over a period<br>
of 0.5 to 6 h.<br>
The thermal treatment can be conducted under protective gas, such as, for example, nitrogen.<br>
The surface treatment can be carried out in heatable mixers and dryers with spraying devices, either<br><br>
continuously or batchwise. Suitable devices can be, for example, plowshare mixers or plate,<br>
cyclone, or fluidized bed dryers.<br>
As starting material, it is possible to employ a pyrogenically prepared aluminum oxide, such<br>
as described in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 4th edition, Volume 21, page 464<br>
(1982).<br>
Furthermore, it is possible to employ, as starting material, a high surface area, pyrogenically<br>
prepared aluminum oxide that has a specific BET surface area of more than 115 m2/g.<br>
This pyrogenically prepared aluminum oxide can be prepared in accordance with the flame<br>
oxidation method or, preferably, by flame hydrolysis, whereby, as starting material, a vaporized<br>
aluminum compound, preferably the chloride, is used. This aluminum oxide is described in DE 199<br>
43 291.0-41 which is relied on and incorporated herein by reference.<br>
As surface modifying agent, except for the mixture consisting of the silanes A and B in<br>
accordance with DE 42 02 694, it is possible to employ the following compounds and mixtures of<br>

Especially preferably, octyltrimethoxysilane and<br>

Excluded are the silanes that are employed in DE 42 02 094 in the form of a mixture.<br>
The pyrogenically prepared, surface modified aluminum oxide in accordance with the<br>
invention can be employed as additives in high temperature polymers.<br>
The surface modified alumina according to this invention can be used in high temperature<br>
polymeric materials useful for wire wrap type applications, including polymeric materials<br>
comprising at least 50 weight percent high temperature polymers, such as, polyimide,<br>
polyetherketone, polyethersulfone polyphthalamide and/or combinations or derivatives.<br><br>
The high temperature polymeric materials comprise corona resistant composite filler, which<br>
is the alumina according to the invention, in an amount within a range between (and including) any<br>
two of the following weight percentages: 2 and 50 weight percent.<br>
The organic component is selected according to the particular solvent system selected for<br>
dispersing the composite filler into the high temperature polymeric material (or precursor thereto).<br>
In one or more steps, the high temperature polymeric material (or precursor thereto) is solvated to a<br>
sufficiently low viscosity to allow the composite filler (also suspendable in the solvent system<br>
concurrently or in a subsequent step or steps) to be dispersed within the polymer or polymer<br>
precursor without undue agglomeration, interfacial voids or other problems that have often been<br>
associated with inorganic particle composite fillers dispersed in high temperature polymeric<br>
materials. The resulting filled polymeric material has been found to have extraordinary corona<br>
resistance, without unduly harming (and in some instances actually improving) mechanical<br>
properties.<br>
The corona resistant high temperature polymeric materials can be suitable for wire insulation<br>
in high voltage applications. For example, wire insulated with the corona resistant compositions can<br>
be used in combination with (or as an integral part of) rotors, stators or the like found in large<br>
industrial dynamo-electric machinery or the like.<br>
The compositions comprise: i.a. high temperature polymeric matrix and ii. a composite,<br>
corona resistant composite filler. These components will be described individually, then in<br>
combination.<br>
High Temperature Polymeric Matrix. Useful high temperature polymeric matrices of the<br>
present invention include as a dominant component a polymer having one or more of the following<br><br>
moieties: amide, imide, ether, sulfone, epoxy, carbonate, ester. Preferred high temperature<br>
polymeric matrix polymers include:<br>
1.	polyimide,<br>
2.	polyester,<br>
3.	polyesteramide,<br>
4.	polyesteramideimide,<br>
5.	polyamide,<br>
6.	polyamideimide,<br>
7.	polyetherimide,<br>
8.	polycarbonate,<br>
9.	polysulfone,<br>
10.	polyether,<br>
11.	polyetherketone,<br>
12.	polyethersulfone,<br>
13.	polyphthalamide,<br>
14.	epoxy resins,<br>
15.	and the like, including derivations and combinations thereof.<br>
In one embodiment, the polymeric matrix is a thermoset polyimide, such as a KAPTON®<br>
brand polyimide available from E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company of Wilmington, DE, USA.<br>
As used herein, the term 'thermoplastic' polyimide is intended to mean a polyimide composition<br>
where the glass transition temperature of the material is less than 375, 350, 325 or 300°C.<br>
Conversely 'thermoset' polyimides are intended to include polyimide compositions where the glass<br>
transition temperature is equal to or greater than the above defined (upper limit) glass transition of a<br>
thermoplastic polyimide, or otherwise where the polyimide does not have a measurable glass<br>
transition temperature.<br>
The polymeric binder is a polyimide synthesized by first forming a polyimide precursor (a<br>
polyamic acid solution) created by reacting (in a solvent system) one or more dianhydride<br>
monomers with one or more diamine monomers. So long as the corona resistant composite filler is<br>
sufficiently dispersible in the polyamic acid solution, the composite filler can be dispersed prior to,<br><br>
during, or after the polyamic acid solution is created, at least until polymerization, imidization,<br>
solvent removal or other subsequent processing increases viscosity beyond what is needed to<br>
disperse the composite filler within the material. Ultimately the precursor (polyamic acid) is<br>
converted into a high temperature polyimide material having a solids content of greater than<br>
99.5 weight percent, and at some point in this process, the viscosity is increased beyond what is<br>
necessary to intermix the composite filler into the polyimide or polyimide precursor. Depending<br>
Upon the particular embodiment chosen, the viscosity could possibly be lowered again by solvating<br>
the material, perhaps sufficient to allow dispersion of the composite filler into the material.<br>
In one embodiment, the polyamic acid solution is formed from one or more aromatic and/or<br>
aliphatic diamine monomers and one or more aromatic and/or aliphatic dianhydride monomers. In<br>
an alternate embodiment the dianhydride and diamine monomers are both aromatic, optionally also<br>
including an aliphatic diamine.<br>
Polyamic acid solutions can be converted to high temperature polyimides using processes<br>
and techniques commonly known in the art, such as heat and/or conventional polyimide conversion<br>
chemistry. Such polyimide manufacturing processes have been practiced for decades, and the<br>
amount of public literature on polyimide manufacture is legion, and hence further discussion here is<br>
unnecessary. Any conventional or non-conventional polyimide manufacturing processes are<br>
appropriate for use in accordance with the present invention, provided a precursor material is<br>
available of sufficiently low viscosity to allow composite filler particles of the present invention to<br>
be mixed therein.<br>
As used herein, an "aromatic" monomer is either a diamine or a dianhydride having at least<br>
one aromatic ring, either alone (i.e., a substituted or unsubstituted, functionalized or<br><br>
unfunctionalized benzene or similar-type aromatic ring) or connected to another (aromatic or<br>
aliphatic) ring.<br>
The term "diamine monomer" as used herein is intended to mean a monomer that reacts with<br>
(is complimentary to) a dianhydride monomer to form an intermediate polyamic acid. The<br>
polyamic acid is then cured, typically under heat, to form a polyimide.<br>
Depending upon the context, the term "diamine monomer" can mean (i.) an unreacted<br>
monomer (i.e., a diamine monomer); (ii.) a partially reacted monomer (i.e., an oligomer or other<br>
polyimide precursor having amine functionality, whereby the precursor is derived in part from<br>
diamine monomer) or (iii.) a diamine portion of a fully reacted polymer (the portion or portions of<br>
the polyimide attributable to the diamine monomer). The diamine monomer can be functionalized<br>
with one or more moieties, depending upon the particular embodiment selected in the practice of the<br>
present invention.<br>
Indeed, the term "diamine" is not intended to be limiting (or interpreted literally) as to the<br>
number of amine moieties in the diamine monomer. For example, (ii.) and (iii.) above include<br>
polymeric materials that may have two, one, or zero amine moieties. Alternatively, the diamine<br>
monomer may be functionalized with additional amine moieties (in addition to the amine moieties<br>
that react with a dianhydride to provide a polyimide chain). Such additional amine moieties could<br>
be used to crosslink the polymer or to provide other functionality to the polymer.<br>
Similarly, the term 'dianhydride monomer' as used herein is intended to mean the monomer<br>
that reacts with (is complimentary to) the diamine monomer to form a polyamic acid, and then upon<br>
curing with heat and/or radiation, a polyimide.<br><br>
Depending upon the context in which it is used, "anhydride" as used herein can mean not<br>
only an anhydride moiety per se, but also a precursor to an anhydride moiety, such as: (i.) a pair of<br>
carboxylic acid groups (which can be converted to anhydride by a dehydration or similar-type<br>
reaction); or (ii.) an acid-acid ester functionality (or any other functionality presently known or<br>
developed in the future which is) capable of conversion to anhydride functionality.<br>
Depending upon context, "dianhydride" can mean: (i) the unreacted form (i.e., a dianhydride<br>
monomer, whether the anhydride functionality is in a true anhydride form or a precursor anhydride<br>
form, as discussed in the prior above paragraph); (ii) a partially reacted form (i.e., the portion or<br>
portions of an oligomer or other partially reacted or precursor polyimide composition reacted from<br>
or otherwise attributable to dianhydride monomer) or (iii) a fully reacted form (the portion or<br>
portions of the polyimide derived from or otherwise attributable to dianhydride monomer).<br>
The dianhydride monomer can be functionalized with one or more moieties, depending upon<br>
the particular embodiment selected in the practice of the present invention. Indeed, the term<br>
"dianhydride" is not intended to be limiting (or interpreted literally) as to the number of anhydride<br>
moieties in the dianhydride monomer. For example, (i.), (ii.) and (iii.) (in the paragraph above)<br>
include organic substances that may have one or zero anhydride moieties, depending upon whether<br>
the anhydride is in a precursor state or a reacted state. Alternatively, the dianhydride monomer may<br>
be functionalized with additional anhydride type moieties (in addition to the anhydride moieties that<br>
react with diamine to provide a polyimide). Such additional anhydride moieties could be used to<br>
crosslink the polymer or to provide other functionality to the polymer.<br>

In an alternative embodiment, an epoxy resin is used as the high temperature polymer<br>
matrix. In one embodiment, the epoxy resin is derived from bisphenol-A diglycidyl ether, epoxy<br>
novolac resins, cycloaliphatic epoxy resins, diglycidyl ester resins, glycidyl ethers of polyphenols or<br>
the like. These resins preferably have an epoxy equivalent weight average molecular weight of<br>
about 130-1500. Such resins are well known in the art and are described in U.S. Pat.<br>
Nos. 2,324,483; 2,444,333; 2,494,295; 2,500,600; and 2,511,913.<br>
Catalytic hardeners, or curing agents for the above mentioned epoxy resins include<br>
aluminum acetylacetonate, aluminum di-sec-butoxide acetoacetic ester chelate or tetraoctylene<br>
glycol titanate in combination with phenolic accelerators, including resorcinol, catechol or<br>
hydroquinone and the corresponding dihydroxynaphthalene compounds. Compositions of this type<br>
have been described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,776,978 and 3,812,214.<br>
The organic component of the composite filler material is chosen primarily to provide or<br>
improve dispensability of the composite filler material into a particular solvated polymer matrix or<br><br>
polymer matrix precursor. Generally speaking, an organic component of similar polarity (to a<br>
selected solvent) and of relatively low molecular weight will more readily disperse in the solvent<br>
than otherwise. Hence the organic component is selected in view of the particular solvent system<br>
into which the composite filler is intended to be dispersed or otherwise intermixed.<br>
Similarly, the inorganic component of the composite filler is selected primarily to provide or<br>
improve corona resistance. Since alumina is a widely accepted corona resistant inorganic ceramic<br>
oxide, it is particularly mentioned herein, but the industry may prefer or otherwise adopt other types<br>
of corona resistant inorganic ceramic oxides, and hence the inorganic component is intended to be<br>
broadly defined.<br>
While not intending to be bound by a particular theory, in at least one embodiment it is<br>
believed that the organic component lowers the surface energy of the inorganic component and thus<br>
allows it to be easily dispersible in organic solvents. Because the composite fillers of the present<br>
invention are more readily dispersible, often with little to no additional shearing force or filtration<br>
required, these slurries often form fewer, perhaps no (or essentially no, i.e., less than 100 per million<br>
(or "ppm"), highly undesired agglomerates in the size range of greater than 0.5 microns. Hence, the<br>
compositions of the present invention can be used to form films having highly improved dielectric<br>
strength and/or highly improved mechanical film properties.<br>
Furthermore in some embodiments, it has been surprisingly discovered that films often have<br>
higher dielectric strength than films made without inorganic ceramic oxide particles incorporated<br>
into the polymer (i.e., pure polyimide polymer without metal oxide or silica filler). Although not<br>
intending to be bound to any particular theory, it is theorized that the composite fillers provide such<br>
an efficient dispersion of non-agglomerated small particles within the polymer matrix that the<br><br>
composite fillers of the present invention may be capable of diluting electric charge along a film's<br>
x-y plane, at least to a greater extent than is observed with unfilled, pure polymer (and also to a<br>
greater extent than conventional poorly dispersed, more highly aggregated ceramic oxide fillers),<br>
perhaps thereby improving electrical resistance in the z direction.<br>
Typically, the composite fillers of the present invention generally do not require extensive<br>
milling and filtration to breakup unwanted particle agglomeration as is typical when attempting to<br>
disperse nano-sized conventional ceramic oxide fillers into a polymer matrix. Such milling and<br>
filtration can be costly and may not be capable of removing all unwanted agglomerates.<br>
Indeed in one embodiment, the composite filler is dispersible and suspendible at 20 weight<br>
percent in a (at least 99 weight percent pure) dimethylacetamide solvent and after dispersing and<br>
suspending the filler into the solvent with a high shear mechanical force, less than 15, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2<br>
or 1 weight percent of the filler precipitates out of solution when kept at rest at 20°C for 72 hours.<br>
Composite, Corona Resistant Filler: Organic Component. The organic component of the<br>
corona resistant composite filler of the present invention can be polymerization (by conventional or<br>
non-conventional techniques) using virtually any monomer, depending upon the embodiment<br>
selected. The organic component is often, at least in part, the organic portion of a (organic-<br>
inorganic) coupling agent reacted to the inorganic component. In selecting the organic component,<br>
proper attention should be given to matching the dispensability of the organic component with the<br>
particular solvent chosen for the particular high temperature polymer matrix selected.<br>
Generally speaking, the organic component is more readily dispersible in a solvent, the more<br>
similar the polarity (or non-polarity) of the organic component with respect to the solvent;<br><br>
furthermore, the lower the molecular weight, generally speaking, the greater the dispensability of<br>
the organic component. Hence, the organic component should be selected in a way that optimizes<br>
the polarity of the composite filler with the polarity of the solvent, while also minimizing the<br>
surplus amount of organic component (that does little to further compatibalize polarity while<br>
thereby unduly adding bulk that is detrimental to dispensability). Ordinary skill and<br>
experimentation may be necessary in optimizing the organic component for any particular solvent<br>
system selected.<br>
Potentially useful monomers include:<br>
1.	unsaturated aromatic compounds such as styrene, alpha-methylstyrene, halogenated styrene<br>
and divinylbenzene;<br>
2.	unsaturated esters such as vinyl acetate and vinyl propionate;<br>
3.	unsaturated nitriles, such as, acrylonitrile;<br>
4.	acrylic acid esters or methacrylic acid esters, such as methyl acrylate, methyl ethacrylate,<br>
ethyl acrylate, ethyl methacrylate, 2-ethylhexyl acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl methacrylate, lauryl<br>
acrylate, lauryl methacrylate, ethyleneglycol diacrylate, ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate,<br>
glycidyl acryiate, glycidyl methacrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate, acryl acrylate and allyl<br>
methacrylate;<br>
5.	C2-C20 alkene or vinyl monomers, such as ethylene, propylene, butylene, butadiene,<br>
isoprene, and the like;<br>
6.	acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, and derivations thereof;<br>
7.	acrylamide, methacrylamide, N-mediylolacrylamide, N-methylolmethacrylamide, and the<br>
like;<br><br>
8.	monomers having one or more polymerizable reactive sites, such as, hydroxyl, epoxy,<br>
carboxyl, anhydride, amino, halide, and the like; and<br>
9.	combinations and derivations thereof.<br>
However, the organic component must be functionalized or otherwise capable of being<br>
bonded to the inorganic ceramic oxide component of the composite filler by means of an organo-<br>
siloxane (and less preferably, an organo-metaloxane) moiety. This can be done by functionalizing<br>
the organic component with a functional group capable of reacting with the inorganic ceramic oxide<br>
component in a way that produces a siloxane (or metaloxane) linkage between the two components.<br>
For example, the organic component can be functionalized with a -Si(R1, R2, R3), where:<br>
-Si-R1,<br>
-Si-R2, and<br>
-Si-R3<br>
are the same or different and at least one of which is further defined as being - SiOR, where<br>
R is either:<br>
1.	hydrogen (i.e., -SiOR is -SiOH); or<br>
2.	a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl capable of undergoing hydrolysis to convert the -OR to -<br>
OH, (i.e., SiOR is a precursor to -SiOH, that is converted to SiOH upon hydrolysis).<br>
In this embodiment, the -SiOH functionalized organic component can be reacted to the<br>
inorganic component, bonding the organic and inorganic components together and thereby forming<br>
a -Si-O-X- bond at the interface of the two components, where X is an atom of the inorganic<br>
component that is either Si or a metal, depending upon the particular inorganic component selected.<br><br>
The forming of an organo-siloxane (or organo-metaloxane) bond at the interface of the two<br>
composite filler components can also be done by functionalizing the inorganic component with an<br>
R'-Si-O-X moiety (or R'-M-O-X- moiety), where X is an atom of (and covalently bonded with and<br>
to) the inorganic component and is either Si or a metal, depending upon the particular inorganic<br>
component selected, and where R' is an organic moiety that is either the entire organic component or<br>
a portion of the organic component that is then reacted with one or more additional organic<br>
reactants to form the organic component.<br>
In one embodiment, the organosiloxane bond between the organic and inorganic components<br>
of the composite filler can be accomplished by using an organo-silane coupling agent, where the<br>
silane group of the coupling agent bonds (forming a siloxane linkage) to the inorganic component<br>
and the organo portion of the coupling agent is selected to bond to the organic component. Useful<br>
such coupling agents may include:<br>
(a)	vinyltrichlorsilane, vinyltris(.beta.-methoxyethoxy)silane, vinyltriethoxysilane,<br>
vinyltrimethoxysilane, gamma-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane, gamma-<br>
mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane and gamma-chloropropyltrimethoxysilane;<br>
(b)	gamma-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane and gamma-glycidoxypropylmethyldiethoxysilane;<br>
and<br>
(c)	N-beta(aminoethyl) .gamma.-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, N-(beta(aminoethyl) gamma-<br>
aminopropylmethyldimethoxysilane and gamma-aminopropyltriethoxysilane.<br>
The silane coupling agents of the present invention preferably have functional groups that<br>
can easily react with the organic component functional groups. For example, for organic<br>
components having carboxyl groups introduced therein, the silane coupling agents of (b) and (c)<br><br>
above with epoxy groups and amino groups are preferred. Among these, gamma-<br>
glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane and N-(beta-(aminoethyl) gamma-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane<br>
are particularly preferred.<br>
A less preferred by alternative coupling agents include organo-metaloxane coupling agents,<br>
such as, acetoalkoxyalurninum diisopropylate and the like, and isopropyl triisostearoyltitanate,<br>
isopropyltridecyl benzenesulfonyltitanate, and the like. Different coupling agents may be used<br>
alone or in combinations of two or more, and coupling agents of different types may also be used<br>
together.<br>
In one embodiment, the organo portion of the coupling agent is all or part of the organic<br>
component of the composite filler. If a commercial or otherwise available coupling agent can be<br>
found having a suitable organo portion offering excellent dispensability with respect to a particular,<br>
desired solvent system, the organic component of the composite filler is generally preferably<br>
obtained by means of the coupling agent. In such circumstances (or otherwise) a sophisticated<br>
inorganic particle supplier, such as Degussa AG of Germany, may be able to custom manufacture a<br>
suitable inorganic/organic composite filler (bonded with an organo-siloxane or organo-metaloxane)<br>
in accordance with the present invention.<br>
Otherwise, the bonding of each coupling agent to a separate organic component can be<br>
accomplished by dispersing the coupling agent in a dispersion containing the organic component<br>
and the inorganic component. Depending upon the particular embodiment of the present invention<br>
chosen, suitable solvent systems can include water, organic solvents and water in combination with<br>
(water miscible) organic solvents, such as many alcohols. Incompatible (or multi-phase) solvent<br>
systems may also be useful, depending upon the particular embodiment selected, provided sufficient<br><br>
agitation or mixing is provided to allow reaction between the coupling agent and both the organic<br>
and inorganic component of the composite filler. When water is included in the dispersion medium,<br>
it is preferred to introduce hydrophilic functional groups such as hydroxyl groups, epoxy groups or<br>
carboxylic groups into the organic component in order to stabilize the organic component in the<br>
dispersion system and achieve uniform dispersion. Introduction of these functional groups can also<br>
promote easier chemical bonding and/or non-chemical bonding of the coupling agent(s). Preferred<br>
alcohols for such use include lower saturated aliphatic alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, 1-<br>
propanol, 2-propanol, 1-butanol, 2-butanol, tert-butanol and the like. These alcohols can be used<br>
alone or in combinations of two or more. Other organic solvents besides alcohol, such as methyl<br>
ethyl ketone and dimethylformamide may be used, and these organic solvents, water and alcohol<br>
may also be used in combination in appropriate weight ratios.<br>
In the above described reaction to create the composite filler, the organic component content<br>
in the dispersion medium is preferably 0.0001-70 wt % (hereunder all percent values will mean<br>
weight percent, unless indicated otherwise), more preferably 0.001-50%, and especially 0.01-25%.<br>
If the content is under 0.0001%, the composite filler yield can be low, and if it is over 70%, one or<br>
more components may fall out of suspension or otherwise dispersion stability can be problematic.<br>
Further, the reaction for forming the composite filler can be promoted by heating or using a catalyst.<br>
For heating, the reaction system temperature is preferably 40-100°C. As catalysts there may be used<br>
acids, bases, aluminum compounds, tin compounds and the like. Acid catalysts and aluminum<br>
catalysts are well known for promoting organo-siloxane or organo-metaloxane reactions with<br>
inorganic oxide particles.<br><br>
Incorporating the Composite Filler Into A High Temperature Polvimide Matrix. Polar<br>
aprotic solvents are particularly useful in forming polyimides. Hence, the composite fillers of the<br>
present invention are preferably designed to readily disperse in polar aprotic solvents, such as, N-<br>
methylpyrrolidinone (NMP), dimethylacetamide (DMAc), gamma-butyrolactone, N,N'-dimethyl-<br>
formamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and tetramethyl urea (TMU). In one embodiment,<br>
the preferred solvent is dimethylacetamide (DMAc).<br>
Co-solvents can also be used generally at about five to 50 weight percent: of the total solvent.<br>
Useful co-solvents include xylene, toluene, benzene, diethyleneglycol diethyl ether, 1,2-<br>
dimethoxyethane (monoglyme), diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (diglyme), l,2-to-(2-<br>
methoxyethoxy) ethane (triglyme), to [2-(2-methoxyethoxy) ethyl)] ether (tetraglyme), to-(2-<br>
methoxyethyl) ether, tetrahydrofuran, "Cellosolve™" (glycol ethyl ether) and "Cellosolve™<br>
acetate" (hydroxyethyl acetate glycol monoacetate).<br>
The corona resistant polyimide films in accordance with the present invention can be<br>
produced by combining diamine and dianhydride monomers together, in the presence of a polar<br>
aprotic solvent, to form a polyamic acid solution (also called a polyamide acid solution). The<br>
dianhydride and diamine monomers are typically combined in a molar ratio of aromatic dianhydride<br>
monomer to aromatic diamine monomer of from about 0.90 to 1.10. Molecular weight of the<br>
polyamic acid can be adjusted by adjusting the molar ratio of the dianhydride and diamine<br>
monomers.<br>
In one embodiment, the polyamic acid solution contains polyamic acid dissolved in a polar<br>
aprotic solvent at a concentration in a range between (and including) any two of the following<br>
percentages: 5,10,12, 15, 20, 25, 27, 30, 40, 45, 50, 55, or 60 (%) percent by weight. In one<br><br>
5,10,15, 20, 25, 30, 35,40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65,70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 250,<br>
300, 350,400, 450, and 500 nanometers. In one embodiment, the average particle size is from 100<br>
to 300 nanometers.<br>
The ratio of polyamic acid to composite filler may be represented by the ratio A:B wherein<br>
A is the weight of the polyamic acid polymer and B is the weight of the composite filler. In one<br>
embodiment, A is a range between and including any two of the following: 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5,<br>
0.6, 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9 and B is 1. In this embodiment, if A is below 0.1, the films formed will<br>
generally be too brittle and may not be sufficiently flexible to form a freestanding, mechanically<br>
tough, flexible sheet that can be wrapped upon a conductive wire. Also in this embodiment, if A is<br>
above 0.9, the films formed therefrom may not be sufficiently corona resistant.<br>
The polyamic acid casting solution mentioned above can optionally further comprise<br>
additional additives, including processing aids (e.g., oligomers), antioxidants, light stabilizers, flame<br>
retardant additives, anti-static agents, heat stabilizers, ultraviolet absorbing agents, inorganic fillers<br>
or various reinforcing agents. Common inorganic fillers include thermally conductive fillers, like<br>
granular metal oxides, and electrically conductive fillers like metals and electrically conductive<br>
polymers. Other common inorganic fillers include granular alumina, granular silica, fumed silica,<br>
silicon carbide, diamond, clay, boron nitride, aluminum nitride, titanium dioxide, dicalcium<br>
phosphate, and fumed metal oxides. Common organic fillers include polyaniline, polythiophene,<br>
polypyrrole, polyphenylenevinylene, polydialkylfluorenes, carbon black, and graphite.<br>
In one embodiment, the polyamic acid casting solution is cast, or applied onto, a support<br>
such as an endless belt or rotating drum. A wet film then formed by heating the solution to remove<br>
some of the solvent. The wet film, sometimes called a 'green' film is converted into a self-<br><br>
embodiment, the solvent content of the polyamic acid solution is in a range of from about 10, 12,<br>
14,16,18,20, or 22, to about 24, 26, 28 or 30 weight (%) percent solvent.<br>
In one embodiment, nano-sized composite filler in accordance with the present invention<br>
(i.e., alumina oxide particles comprising C2-C12 alkyl organic component linked to the alumina via<br>
an organo siloxane linkage) are first dispersed in a solvent to form a slurry and then the slurry is<br>
dispersed in the polyamic acid precursor solution. The mixture is called a filled polyamic acid<br>
casting solution. The concentration of composite filler to polyimide (in the final film) is typically in<br>
the range of 5,10,15, 20, 25, 30, 35, or 40, to about 45, 50, 55, 60, 65 or 70 (%) percent by weight.<br>
As the concentration of the composite filler increases, the corona resistance of the composite<br>
polyimide also increases.<br>
The filled polyamic acid casting solution is typically a blend of a pre-formed polyamic acid<br>
solution and composite filler to form a slurry, where in at least one embodiment, the composite filler<br>
is present in a concentration range from about 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 or 10 weight (%) percent to about 15, 20,<br>
25, 30, 35, 40, 45 or 50 (%) weight percent. In one embodiment, the composite Filler is first<br>
dispersed in the same polar aprotic solvent used to make the polyamic acid solution (e.g. DMAc).<br>
Optionally, a small amount of polyamic acid solution may be added to the composite filler slurry to<br>
either increase the viscosity of the slurry, or stabilize the slurry from unwanted particles<br>
agglomeration.<br>
In one embodiment, a composite filler slurry is blended with a polyamic acid solution to<br>
form the filled polyamic acid casting solution. This blending operation can include high sheer<br>
mixing. Preferably, the average particle size of the composite filler in the slurry and the casting<br>
solution and final polyimide film is in a range between and including any two of the following sizes:<br><br>
supporting film by baking at an appropriate temperature where the solids are from 60, 65, 70, 75,<br>
80, 85, and 90 weight percent. The green film is separated from the support, molecularly oriented<br>
tentering with continued thermal and radiation curing, to provide a fully cured polyimide film<br>
having a weight percent solids above 98.5%.<br>
Other useful methods for producing polyimide films in accordance with the present<br>
invention can be found in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,166,308 and 5,298,331 and are incorporated by<br>
reference into this specification for all teachings therein. Numerous variations are also possible<br>
such as:<br>
(a)	A method wherein the diamine monomers and dianhydride monomers are preliminarily mixed<br>
together and then the mixture is added in portions to a solvent while stirring.<br>
(b)	A method wherein a solvent is added to a stirring mixture of diamine and dianhydride<br>
monomers (contrary to (a) above).<br>
(c)	A method wherein diamines are exclusively dissolved in a solvent and then dianhydrides are<br>
added thereto at such a ratio as allowing to control the reaction rate.<br>
(d)	A method wherein the dianhydride monomers are exclusively dissolved in a solvent and then<br>
amine components are added thereto at such a ratio to allow control of the reaction rate.<br>
(e)	A method wherein the diamine monomers and the dianhydride monomers are separately<br>
dissolved in solvents and then these solutions are mixed in a reactor.<br>
(f)	A method wherein the polyamic acid with excessive amine component and another polyamic<br>
acid with excessive anhydride component are preliminarily formed and then reacted with each<br>
other in a reactor, particularly in such a way as to create a non-random or block copolymer.<br><br>
(g) A method wherein a specific portion of the amine components and dianhydride components are<br>
first reacted and then residual dianhydride monomer is reacted, or vice versa,<br>
(h) A method wherein the silane coated fumed alumina oxide particles are dispersed in a solvent<br>
and then injected into a stream of polyamic acid to form a filled polyamic acid casting solution<br>
and then cast to form a green film,<br>
(i) A method wherein the components are added in part or in whole in any order to either part or<br>
whole of the solvent, also where part or all of any component can be added as a solution in part<br>
or all of the solvent,<br>
(j) A method of first reacting one of the dianhydride monomers with one of the diamine monomers<br>
giving a first polyamic acid, then reacting the other dianhydride monomer with the other amine<br>
component to give a second polyamic acid, and then combining the amic acids in any one of a<br>
number of ways prior to film formation.<br>
It is preferable to use a heating system having a plurality of heating sections or zones. It is<br>
also generally preferable that the maximum heating temperature be controlled to give a maximum<br>
air (or nitrogen) temperature of the ovens from about 200 to 600°C, more preferably from 350 to<br>
500°C. By regulating the maximum curing temperature of the green film within the range as<br>
defined above, it is possible to obtain a polyimide film that has excellent mechanical strength,<br>
adhesive character, and thermal dimensional stability.<br>
Alternatively, heating temperatures can be set to 200-600°C while varying the heating time.<br>
Regarding the curing time, it is preferable that the polyimide films of the present invention be<br>
exposed to the maximum heating temperature for about 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45 or<br>
50 seconds to about 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 200, 400, 500, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1100 or 1200 seconds.<br><br>
The heating temperature may be changed stepwise so as not to wrinkle the film by drying to<br>
quickly.<br>
The thickness of the polyimide film may be adjusted depending on the intended purpose of<br>
the film or final application specifications. Depending upon the design criteria of any particular<br>
embodiment chosen, the film thickness can be in a range between (and including) any two of the<br>
following film thicknesses: 8, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60, 80, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200,<br>
300,400 and 500 microns. In one embodiment, the thickness is from about 12 to about 125 microns<br>
and is preferably from 25 to 75 microns.<br>
As used herein, the term 'corona resistant' means a material possessing the physical property<br>
of being able to withstand a prolonged electrical plasma attack for a specific period. In the case of a<br>
film, corona resistance is typically measured using a film sample of film that is about one thousands<br>
of an inch thick (-1.0 mil) or 25 microns. If the 1 mil (25 micron) film is capable of withstanding<br>
750 volts of electricity (applied to the film using a copper probe measuring ¼" in diameter) at 1050<br>
Hz for a period of greater than 200 hours, the film is said to be 'corona resistant.' In one<br>
embodiment, the polyimide films of the present invention survived over 1000 hours of corona<br>
testing.<br>
As used herein, the term 'dielectric strength' is a term used to describe the amount of voltage<br>
a material can withstand in short instance of time. Dielectric strength of one-mil thick,<br>
conventional, unfilled (non-corona resistant) polyimide film is typically about 7,800 volts/mil.<br>
Conventional corona resistant films generally provide a dielectric strength of about 7,400 volts/mil.<br>
In one embodiment, one class of films according to the present invention are defined as having a<br>
dielectric strength greater than 7400,7500, 7600, 7700, 7800, 7900, or 8000 volts/mil.<br><br>
As used herein, the term 'elongation' is used to describe a film's ability to stretch under<br>
physical pulling force without breaking. In an elongation test, a film sample is placed between two<br>
holding clamps. The clamps are pulled in opposite directions. The distance the clamps are able to<br>
travel before the material breaks determines the amount of mechanical elongation present in the<br>
film. A higher elongation in a film allows the film to wrap more easily around an electrical wire in<br>
an electrical insulation application. Typical one-mil thick polyimide generally has an elongation of<br>
about 90 to 100 percent (%). Typical corona resistant polyimide films, like DuPont KAPTON<br>
CR®, generally have a mechanical elongation of about 40-60 percent (%). In one embodiment, one<br>
class of corona resistant films according to the present invention have a mechanical elongation of<br>
greater than 60, 65 or 70 percent.<br>
hi accordance with the present invention, the corona-resistant films herein are used to wrap,<br>
or coat, electrical conductors or conductor wires. These films are also used to impregnate laminated<br>
electrical insulation, thus providing superior electrical insulating systems. Additionally, multiple<br>
strands of conductive wires wrapped with such corona resistant films are wound together to form<br>
turns and coils. In these applications and depending upon the particular embodiment selected,<br>
corona resistance can be at least 10 times greater than the conventional insulation used for this<br>
purpose. Still further, such novel coils have special utility in the construction of transformers and<br>
dynamoelectric machine rotor/stators.<br>
Examples:<br>
In order to prepare the aluminum oxide, a volatile aluminum compound is sprayed through a<br>
nozzle into a detonating gas made up of hydrogen and air. hi most cases, aluminum trichloride is<br><br>
used. This substance undergoes hydrolysis, under the influence of the water formed during the<br>
detonating gas reaction, to give aluminum oxide and hydrochloric acid. After leaving the flame, the<br>
aluminum oxide enters a so-called coagulation zone, in which the aluminum oxide primary particles<br>
and primary aggregate agglomerate. The product, which is present in this stage as a kind of aerosol,<br>
is separated in cyclones from the gaseous accompanying substances and afterwards treated with<br>
moist hot air.<br>
The particle size of the aluminum oxides can be varied by means of the reaction conditions,<br>
such as, for example, flame temperature, hydrogen or oxygen proportion, aluminum trichloride<br>
quantity, residence time in the flame, or length of the coagulation zone.<br>
Preparation of the pyrogenicallv prepared aluminum oxide I<br>
In a burner of known design, 320 kg/h of aluminum trichloride (AlCl3), which has been<br>
vaporized beforehand, is combusted together with 100 Nm3/h of hydrogen and 450 Nm3/h of air.<br>
The finely divided, high surface area, pyrogenically prepared aluminum oxide is separated<br>
after the flame reaction from the simultaneously formed hydrochloric acid gases in a filter or<br>
cyclone; subsequently, traces of HCl that still adhere are removed by treatment with moistened air<br>
at elevated temperature.<br>
The high surface area, pyrogenically prepared aluminum oxide I that forms has the physical-<br>
chemical characteristic data shown in Table I. In Table 1, for comparison, the data of commercially<br>
available, pyrogenic aluminum oxide of the company Degussa AG / Frankfurt is included. (Trade<br>
name Aluminiumoxid C [Aluminum Oxide C])<br><br><br>
As pyrogenically prepared aluminum oxide n, an aluminum oxide with the following<br>
physical-chemical characteristic data is employed. It is known from the Schriftenreihe Pigmente Nr.<br>

Determination of the physical-chemical characteristic data<br>
BET surface area<br>
The BET surface area is determined in accordance with DIN 66 131 with nitrogen.<br>
Tamped density<br>
Determination of the tamped density in adaptation of DIN ISO 787/XI<br>
Fundamentals of the tamped density determination<br>
The tamped density (formerly the tamped volume) is equal to the quotient of the mass and<br>
the volume of a powder after tamping in the tamping volumeter under predetermined conditions. In<br>
accordance with DIN ISO 787/XI, the tamped density is given in g/cm3. Because of the very low<br>
tamped density of the oxides, however, the value is given in g/L by us. Furthermore, the drying and<br>
sieving as well as the repetition of the tamping operation is dispensed with.<br>
Apparatus for tamped density determination<br>
Tamping volumeter<br>
Volumetric cylinder<br>
Laboratory scale (Reading to 0.01 g)<br><br>
Carrying out the tamped density determination<br>
200 ± 10 mL of oxide is filled into the volumetric cylinder of the tamping volumeter in such<br>
a way that no pores remain and the surface is level. The mass of the filled sample is determined<br>
precisely to 0.01 g. The volumetric cylinder with the sample is placed in the volumetric cylinder<br>
holder of the tamping volumeter and tamped 1250 times. The volume of the tamped oxide is read<br>
off 1 time exactly.<br>
Evaluation of the tamped density determination<br><br>
PH value<br>
The pH value is determined in 4 % aqueous dispersion for hydrophobic oxides in Water : methanol<br>
1:1.<br>
Reagents for the pH value determination<br>
Distilled or completely deionized water, pH &gt; 5.5<br>
Methanol, p.a.<br>
Buffer solutions pH 7.00 pH 4.66<br>
Apparatus for pH value determination<br>
Laboratory scale, (Reading to 0.1 g)<br>
Glass beaker, 250 mL<br>
Magnetic stirrer<br>
Magnetic rod, length 4 cm<br>
Combined pH electrodes<br>
pH measuring apparatus<br>
Dispensers, 100 mL<br><br>
Working procedure for the determination of the pH value<br>
The determination is conducted in adaptation of DIN/ISO 787/IX:<br>
Calibration: Prior to the pH value determination, the measuring apparatus is calibrated with the<br>
buffer solutions. If several measurements are carried out in succession, a single calibration suffices.<br>
4 g of hydrophilic oxide is stirred into a paste in a 250 mL glass beaker with 96 g (96 mL) of<br>
water by use of a dispenser and stirred for five minutes with a magnetic stirrer while the pH<br>
electrode is immersed (rpm approx. 1000 min-1).<br>
4 g of hydrophobic oxide is stirred into a paste in a 250 mL glass beaker with 48 g (61 mL)<br>
of methanol and the suspension is diluted with 48 g (48 mL) of water and stirred for five minutes<br>
with a magnetic stirrer while the pH electrode is immersed (rpm approx. 1000 min-1).<br>
After the stirrer has been switched off, the pH is read off after a standing time of one minute. The<br>
result is given to within one decimal place.<br>
Drying loss<br>
In contrast to the weighed quantity of 10 g mentioned in DIN ISO 787 II, a weighed quantity<br>
of 1 g is used for the drying loss determination.<br>
The cover is put in place prior to cooling. A second drying is not conducted.<br>
Approx. 1 g of the sample is weighed precisely to 0.1 mg into a weighing dish with a ground<br>
cover that has been dried at 105°C, the formation of dust being avoided, and dried for two hours in<br>
the drying cabinet at 105°C. After cooling in a desiccator with its cover still on, the sample is<br>
reweighed under blue gel.<br><br><br>
The result is given to within one decimal place.<br>
Loss on ignition<br>
Apparatus for the determination of the loss on ignition<br>
Porcelain crucible with crucible cover<br>
Muffle furnace<br>
Analysis scale (Reading to 0.1 mg)<br>
Desiccator<br><br>
Carrying out the Loss on Ignition<br>
In departure from DIN 55 921,0.3 - 1 g of the undried substance is weighed to precisely 0.1<br>
mg into a porcelain crucible with a crucible cover, which have been heated red hot beforehand, and<br>
heated red hot for 2 hours at 1000°C in a muffle furnace.<br>
The formation of dust is to be carefully avoided. It has proven advantageous to place the<br>
weighed samples into the muffle furnace while the latter are still cold. Slow heating of the furnace<br>
prevents the creation of stronger air turbulence in the porcelain crucible. After 1000°C has been<br>
reached, red-hot heating is continued for a further 2 hours. Subsequently, a crucible cover is put in<br>
place and the weight loss of the crucible is determined in a desiccator over blue gel.<br>
Evaluation of the determination of the loss on ignition<br>
Because the loss on ignition is determined relative to the sample dried for 2 h at 105°C, the<br>
following calculation formula results:<br><br>
mo = weighed quantity (g)<br>
TV = drying loss (%)<br>
m1 = weight of the sample after being heated red hot(g)<br><br>
The result is given to within one decimal place.<br>
Preparation of the products in accordance with the invention<br>
The pyrogenically prepared aluminum oxides are placed in a mixer for surface modification<br>
and sprayed first with water and afterwards with the surface modifying agent. After the spraying<br>
has ended, mixing can be continued for an additional 15 to 30 min and tamping is subsequently<br>
carried out for 1 to 4 h. The water employed can be acidified with an. acid - for example,<br>
hydrochloric acid - to give a pH value of 7 to 1. The surface modifying agent employed can be<br>
dissolve in a solvent, such as, for example, ethanol.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 18<br>
Silane coated fumed alumina oxide particles according to example 12 were dispersed in a<br>
polyimide film. A 19 solids weight (%) percent solution of a polyamic acid derived from<br>
pyromellitic acid (PMDA) and 4,4'-oxydianiline (4,4'-ODA) was prepared. The viscosity of the<br>
polyamic acid was about 1,000 poise at approximately 98% stoichiometry. The polyamic acid was<br>
then degassed and allowed to equilibrate for 24 hours.<br>
Silane coated fumed alumina oxide according to example 12, made using a vapor coating<br>
process, was added to DMAc to form a 10% by weight slurry. The slurry was sheared using a low<br>
shearing force for approximately 5 minutes to disperse the particles. The silane surface coated<br>
alumina slurry was then added to the degassed polyamic a cid solution until a 15% by weight<br>
concentration of alumina to polymer was achieved. The viscosity of the mixture was adjusted by<br>
adding more dianhydride so that the viscosity was about 1000 poise.<br>
Next, the polyamic acid and alumina mixtures were poured onto a glass plate and dried in a<br>
hot oven where the temperature was ramped from 60°C to 150°C over 15 minutes. A 70 weight %<br>
solids semi-cured green film was produced. The semi-cured film was then cured for 3 minutes in a<br>
300°C oven to obtain a ~1 mil thick polyimide film having about 99.5% solids. The sample was<br>
then tested on a Hypotronics ramping voltage dielectric tester. The average of 20 dielectric tests is<br>
listed as EXAMPLE 1 in the Table 5 below.<br><br>
