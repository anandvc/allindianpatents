A solution of 1 part of the present compound (A), 5 parts of dichloromethane and 34 parts of deodorized kerosene is filled in an aerosol vessel.  A valve is attached to the vessel and 60 parts propellant (liquefied<br><br>
petroleum gas) is charged under pressure through the valve to obtain an oily aerosol. Formulation Example 9<br>
A solution of 0.6 part of the present compound (A), 5 parts of xylene, 3.4 parts of deodorized kerosene and 1 part of Atmos 300 (emulsifier, trademark of Atlas Chemical Co.) and 50 parts of water are filled in an aerosol vessel. A valve is attached to the vessel and 40 parts propellant (liquefied petroleum gas) is charged under pressure through the valve to obtain an aqueous aerosol. Formulation Example 10<br>
A solution of 0.3 g of the present compound (A) in 20 ml of acetone is uniformly mixed with 99.7 g of a base material for a mosquito-coil (mixture of Tabu powder, Pyrethrum marc and wood powder at the ratio of 4:3:3).  To the mixture is added 100 ml of water and the resulting mixture is thoroughly kneaded, then molded and dried to obtain a mosquito-coil. Formulation Example 11<br>
A solution is prepared by adding acetone to 0.8 g of the present compound (A) and 0.4 g of piperonyl butoxide and adjusting to 10 ml.  A base material (a plate of compacted fibrils of a mixture of pulp and cotton linter: 2.5 cm X 1.5 cm, 0.3 cm of thickness) is uniformly impregnated with 0.5 ml of the above solution to obtain a<br><br>
mosquito-mat for electric heating. Formulation Example 12<br>
A solution of 3 parts of the present compound (A) in 97 pars of deodorized kerosene is filled in a container made of polyvinyl chloride.  Into the container is inserted an absorptive wick made of inorganic powder solidified with a binder and then calcined, whose upper portion can be heated with a heater, to obtain a part of a absorptive wick type electric heating fumigation device.

The following Test Examples will show that the present compound is useful as an active ingredient for pest controlling agents. Test Example 1<br>
A solution of 0.025 part of the present compound (A)<br><br>
in 10 parts of dichloromethane was mixed with 89.975 parts of deodorized kerosene to obtain a 0.025% oil solution.<br>
Adult houseflies (5 males and 5 females) were left in a cubic chamber (70 cm at each side).  Into the chamber, 0.7 ml of 0.025% oil solution of the present compound (A) prepared above was sprayed with a spray gun at a pressure of 8.8 X 104 Pa from a small window on the side of the chamber.  Two minutes after spraying, the number of the knocked-down insects was counted (repeated twice).<br>
The same test was carried out except that 4-propargyl-2,3,5,6-tetrafluorobenzyl (IR)-trans-3-(2-methyl-l-propenyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate represented by the formula:<br><br>
(The compound described as compound 2 in TABLE 1 of EP 0196156 Al; hereinafter, referred to as the comparative compound 1) was used instead of the present compound (A).<br>
Knock-down ratios, i.e., ratios of the number of knocked-down insects 2 minutes after the spraying to the number of tested insects, are shown in Table 1.<br><br><br>
Test Example 2<br>
A solution of 0.00625 part of the present compound (A) in 10 parts of dichloromethane was mixed with 89.99375 parts of deodorized kerosene to obtain a 0.00625% oil solution.<br>
Adult houseflies (5 males and 5 females) were left in a cubic chamber (70 cm at each side).  Into the chamber, 0.7 ml of 0.00625% oil solution of the present compound (A) prepared above was sprayed into the chamber with a spray-gun at a pressure of 8.8 X 10' Pa from a small window on the side of the chamber.  Then, up to 10 minutes after spraying, the number of the knocked-down insects was counted with time (repeated twice).  The time required for knocking down 90% of the tested insects (KTgo) was calculated from the results.<br>
The same tests were carried out except for using the comparative compound 1 and 4-methoxymethyl-2,3,5,6-tetrafluorobenzyl (1R)-trans-3-(2-cyano-l-propenyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate represented by the formula:<br><br>
(The compound described in JP 2004-2363 A; hereinafter, referred to as the comparative compound 2.). The results are shown in Table 2.<br><br><br>
