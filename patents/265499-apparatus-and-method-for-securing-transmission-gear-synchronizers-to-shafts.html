APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR SECURING<br>
TRANSMISSION GEAR SYNCHRONIZERS TO SHAFTS<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
[0001] The present application claims priority to United States Provisional Patent<br>
Application Serial No.: 60/898850 filed on February 1, 2007 and hereby incorporated by<br>
reference.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to a system and method for preventing axial<br>
movement of a synchronizer and other elements along a shaft.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] Vehicle transmissions conventionally have a plurality of synchronizers.<br>
The synchronizers transfer the torque from various shafts to the gears and from gears to<br>
shafts through splines. It is important to connect the synchronizers to the shafts in such a<br>
way to prevent axial movement of the hub of the synchronizer relative to the shaft. One<br>
common method for attaching the hub of the synchronizer to the shaft is to press fit the<br>
hub on to the shaft. Unfortunetly, the press fit varies due to manufacturing tolerances.<br>
Thus, gear loading through the hub of the synchronizer to the ground or structural<br>
members (i.e. transmission case walls, center supports, etc.) can unseat the synchronizer<br>
hubs and cause them to move axially. Eventually, axial movement of the synchronizer<br>
1<br>
Attorney Docket No.: P000744-PTT-DLT<br>
hubs will increase the clearance between the shaft and the hub splines, which will lead to<br>
high operating noise, and may cause shaft and/or Hub failure.<br>
[0004] Known prior art solutions use additional features (i.e. additional snap rings<br>
or bearings pushed on shafts with a heavy press fit) to secure the synchronizer hubs to the<br>
shafts. While these methods may improve the connection of the hubs to the shafts these<br>
prior art methods do not eliminate axial movement of the synchronizer hubs. For<br>
example, the clearance between the snap ring and bearing race or gear hub, which allows<br>
the synchronizer hub to move axially and eventually may cause the synchronizer hub<br>
failure.<br>
[0005] While shaft bearings (i.e. tapered bearings) reduce axial movement of the<br>
synchronizer hubs in the early operating life of the transmission, axial clearance which<br>
causes axial movement of the synchronizer hub is not eliminated. Moreover, over time<br>
the bearing races move axially due to a creaping process and, consequently, allow the<br>
synchronizer hub to move axially and in turn may lead to synchronizer hub failure.<br>
[0006] Accordingly, a new and improved apparatus and method for retaining the<br>
synchronizers and other components on a transmission shaft is needed.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0007] In an aspect of the present invention a transmission having a plurality of<br>
gears mounted to an adjustable shaft assembly for providing a plurality of speed ratios is<br>
provided. The transmission includes a shaft assembly having a first shaft, a first sleeve<br>
shaft, a second sleeve shaft, and a first fastener and a plurality of synchronizers. The first<br>
shaft has a flange end and an adjustment end. The first sleeve shaft is concentric with the<br>
2<br>
Attorney Docket No.: P000744-PTT-DLT<br>
first shaft and has a first end. The first end of the first sleeve shaft is in communication<br>
with the flange end of the first shaft. The second sleeve shaft is concentric with the first<br>
shaft and is axially aligned with the first sleeve shaft. The second sleeve shaft has a first<br>
end. The plurality of synchronizers for selectively connecting at least one of the plurality<br>
of gears to at least one of the first and second sleeve shafts. The first fastener is<br>
engagable with the adjustment end of the first shaft and is configured to move axially on<br>
the adjustment end. The first fastener has a fastener flange that contacts the first end of<br>
the second sleeve shaft. The engagement of the first fastener with the adjustment end<br>
generates a compressive force through the flange end of the first shaft to the first end of<br>
the first sleeve shaft and through the fastener flange to the first end of the second sleeve<br>
thereby forcing the first sleeve shaft to move closer to the second sleeve shaft.<br>
[0008] In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, the adjustment<br>
end is a threaded end portion of the first shaft.<br>
[0009] In accordance with yet another aspect of the present invention, the first<br>
fastener is an internally threaded nut that is turned onto the threaded end portion of the<br>
first shaft.<br>
[0010| In accordance with yet another aspect of the present invention, the<br>
transmission further comprises a second shaft having a flange end and an adjustment end.<br>
[0011] In accordance with yet another aspect of the present invention, the<br>
transmission further comprises a third sleeve shaft concentric with the second shaft<br>
having a first end, wherein the first end of the third sleeve shaft is in communication with<br>

transmission further comprises a second fastener engagable with the adjustment end of<br>
the second shaft and configured to move axially on the adjustment end, wherein the<br>
second fastener has a fastener flange that contacts the first end of the second sleeve and<br>
whereby the engagement of the second fastener with the adjustment end generates a<br>
compressive force through the flange end of the second shaft to the first end of the third<br>
sleeve shaft and through the fastener flange to the first end of the fourth sleeve thereby<br>
forcing the third sleeve shaft to move closer to the fourth sleeve shaft.<br>
[0013] In accordance with still another aspect of the present invention, the first<br>
sleeve shaft further comprises a step in the first sleeve shaft that contacts at least one of<br>
the plurality of synchronizers.<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
[0016] FIGURE 1 is a partial cross-sectional view of an embodiment of a<br>
transmission having an apparatus for retaining the synchronizers and other components<br>
on the transmission shaft to prevent axial movement of the synchronizers and other<br>
components along the shaft, in accordance with the present invention.<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
[0017] Referring to Fig. 1, a partial cross-sectional view of a transmission 10 is<br>
illustrated. The transmission 10 includes an input member 11 and output member (not<br>
shown). In the present embodiment, the input member and the output member are shafts,<br>
and will be referred to as such. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the input and<br>
output members may be components other than shafts. The input shaft is continuously<br>
connected with a torque converter or other starting device. An engine (not shown) is<br>
connected to and provides a driving torque to the torque converter (not shown). The<br>
5<br>
Attorney Docket No.: P000744-PTT-DLT<br>
output shaft is continuously connected with a final drive unit (not shown). The<br>
transmission 10 may include a countershaft gearing arrangement that includes<br>
intermediate shafts, countershafts, co-planar intermeshing gear sets and selectively<br>
engagable synchronizers as will be described herein.<br>
[0018] In the present embodiment, a countershaft gearing arrangement 200<br>
includes a first sleeve shaft 14, a first input shaft 20 and a second sleeve shaft 22. Torque<br>
is transferred from a torque converter (not shown) to input member 11 that is rotationally<br>
fixed to first input shaft 20. First input shaft 20 transfers the driving torque to second<br>
sleeve shaft 22 through splines 24. First sleeve shaft 14 is a sleeve shaft concentric with<br>
the first input shaft 20. Further, an extension shaft 21 is coupled to and axially aligned<br>
with second sleeve shaft 22. Moreover, the countershaft gearing arrangement 200 further<br>
includes a single countershaft 23 having a first countershaft portion 26 and a second<br>
countershaft portion 28, which are axially aligned and coupled to one another through<br>
splines 30. Countershaft portions 26 and 28 are both spaced from and parallel with first<br>
sleeve shaft 14, first input shaft 20 and second sleeve shaft 22. Alternatively, the present<br>
invention contemplates multiple countershafts.<br>
[0019] A dual clutch 29 is connected between transmission input shaft (not<br>
shown) and first sleeve shaft 14, first input shaft 20 and second sleeve shaft 22. The dual<br>
clutch 29 includes a first and a second clutch elements or hubs 12 and 18. Clutch<br>
elements 12 and 18 together with clutch shaft 16 are configured to form a friction clutch,<br>
as well known in the art as a dual clutch. More specifically, clutch elements 12, 18 have<br>
friction plates mounted thereon that interact to form a friction clutch. Further, clutch<br>
element 12 is connected for common rotation through clutch shaft 16 to first sleeve shaft<br>
6<br>
Attorney Docket No.: P000744-PTT-DLT<br>
14 and clutch element 18 is connected for common rotation with first input shaft 20.<br>
Thus, selective engagement of clutch element 12, connects the input shaft for common<br>
rotation with first sleeve shaft 14 and selective engagement of clutch element 18,<br>
connects the input shaft for common rotation with first input shaft 20.<br>
[0020] The countershaft gearing arrangement 200 also includes co-planar,<br>
intermeshing gear sets. For example, gears 33, 35 are concentric with and selectively<br>
engagable with first sleeve shaft 14, gears 37, 39 are concentric and selectively engagable<br>
with second sleeve shaft 22, gears 41, 43 are concentric and selectively engagable with<br>
first countershaft portion 26, and gears 45, 47 are concentric and selectively engagable<br>
with second countershaft portion 28.<br>
[0021] The present invention provides an apparatus and method for preloading<br>
elements (ie. bearing races, sleeves, gear hubs, synchronizer hubs and the like) mounted<br>
about first sleeve shaft 14, second sleeve shaft 22, first countershaft portion 26 and<br>
second countershaft portion 28. More specifically, an elongated member or bolt 34 is<br>
attached or integrally formed on an end portion of first input shaft 20. Member or bolt<br>
34 has an ajustment end portion. For example, the adjustment end portion of bolt 34<br>
includes external threads that cooperate and engage a fastener member or internally<br>
threaded nut 32 to preload elements disposed about first sleeve shaft 14 and second<br>
sleeve shaft 22.<br>
[0022] For example, tightening or turning nut 32 creates tension or a preload<br>
force in bolt 34 and first shaft 20. The preload force is transferred from a flange 36 of the<br>
shaft 20 through thrust bearing 38 and clutch shaft 16 to the inner race of cylindrical<br>
bearing 40, then through the washer 42 and sleeve 44 to the synchronizer hub 46.<br>
7<br>
Attorney Docket No.: P000744-PTT-DLT<br>
Thereafter, the preload force is transferred from hub 46 through sleeve 48 and washer 50<br>
to first sleeve shaft 14. From first sleeve shaft 14 the preload force is transfer to the inner<br>
race of angular ball bearing 52 and through the bearing balls to the outer race of ball<br>
bearing 52 to a structural transmission housing member or ground 68.<br>
[0023] The same amount of preload force generated by turning nut 32 onto bolt<br>
34 acts on the inner race of cylindrical bearing 54 and is transferred to the second sleeve<br>
shaft 22. More specifically, nut 32 has a flange 31 that engages or contacts the inner race<br>
of cylindrical bearing 54, thus the preload force is transferred to the inner race through<br>
flange 31. Second sleeve shaft 22 transfers the preload force to the synchronizer hub 56<br>
thru a shaft step or transition 58. Further, the preload force is transferred from the<br>
synchronizer hub 56 to a sleeve 60, a spacer 62 and to the inner race of angular ball<br>
bearing 66. Then finally the preload force propagates through the balls of angular<br>
bearing 66 to the outer race of bearing 66 to a structural transmission housing member or<br>
ground 68. Thus, any clearances between the elements mounted about first sleeve shaft<br>
14, second sleeve shaft 22 (ie. bearing races, sleeves, gear hubs, synchronizer hubs and<br>
the like ) are reduced or eliminated.<br>
[0024] Advantageously, the present invention limits the preload by providing a<br>
selective washers 42, 50, which may be interchanged with washers of a desired thickness<br>
or size. The selected washers of a desired thickness are used limit the preload force. It<br>
should be noted that further turning or tightening nut 32, when the distance in the<br>
interface 70 between first shaft 20 and second sleeve shaft 22 equals zero, causes tension<br>
in bolt 34 and compression in second sleeve shaft 22.<br>
8<br>
Attorney Docket No.: P000744-PTT-DLT<br>
[0025] In a similar manner, preloading elements (ie. bearing races, sleeves, gear<br>
hubs, synchronizer hubs and the like) on first countershaft portion 26 and second<br>
countershaft portion 28 is achieved through the use of fastener or nut 72 and bolt 74.<br>
More specifically, nut 72 is turned onto bolt 74 a predetermined amount to reduce or<br>
eleiminate any clearances between bearing races, sleeves, gear hubs, synchronizer hubs<br>
and the first and second countershaft portions. The preload force is transferred from bolt<br>
flange 76, through inner race of cylindrical bearing 78 to the first countershaft portion 26<br>
and then to the synchronizer hub 80 through to shaft step 82. The preload force is then<br>
transferred from the hub 80 through the sleeve 84 and washer 86 to the angular contact<br>
ball bearing 88. From the other end of the transmission, the nut 72 has a flange 73 that<br>
contacts or engages the inner race of cylindrical bearing 90. Further, the preload force is<br>
transferred through the washer 92 and sleeve 94 to the synchronizer hub 96. Moreover,<br>
the preload force acting on hub 96 is transferred to the second countershaft portion 28<br>
through the step 98. Second countershaft portion 28 transfers the preload to gear hub 100<br>
which in turn transfers the preload force to the angular ball bearing 102. Thus, any<br>
clearances between the elements mounted about first countershaft portion 26, second<br>
countershaft portion 28 (ie. bearing races, sleeves, gear hubs, synchronizer hubs and the<br>
like ) are reduced or eliminated.<br>
[0026] Accordingly, the use of bolts 34 and 74 and nuts 32 and 72 to create<br>
preloading eliminates clearances in shaft assemblies and creates desired conditions for<br>
synchronizer hubs. Moreover, the present invention allows for the use of transmission<br>
housing or case materials having high coefficients of thermal expansion (e.g.<br>
Magnesium) without significantly affecting the bearing design and preload setting. This<br>
9<br>
Attorney Docket No.: P000744-PTT-DLT<br>
is due to the fact that: 1) cylindrical roller bearings 78, 90 are mounted at the ends of each<br>
shaft 26 and 28, respectively, and cylindrical roller bearings 40, 54 are mounted at the<br>
ends of each shaft 14 and 22, respectively; 2) the angular contact ball bearings 88, 102<br>
are mounted in close proximity to each other at the other end of shafts 26 and 28,<br>
respectively, and the angular contact ball bearings 52, 66 are mounted in close proximity<br>
to each other at the other end of shafts 14 and 22, respectively; and 3) the bearing outside<br>
diameter fit to the case is a loose fit at room temperature. This bearing arrangement<br>
provides axial space saving as compared to the use of two pairs of tappered roller<br>
bearings or combination of double row ball bearings and cylindrical roller bearings.<br>
[0027] While the best modes for carrying out the invention have been described<br>
in detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will recognize various<br>
alternative designs and embodiments for practicing the invention.<br>
