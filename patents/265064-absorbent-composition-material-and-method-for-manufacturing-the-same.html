ABSORBENT COMPOSITE MATERIAL AND METHOD FOR MANUFACTURING<br>
THE SAME<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates to a thin, lightweight sheet-shaped<br>
absorber, and to a method for manufacturing the same. Because this absorber is an<br>
absorbent composite with excellent water-absorbing capability, absorption speed and<br>
high-dispersion properties, it is suitable for use in hygiene products such as<br>
disposable diapers and sanitary napkins. The present invention also relates to an<br>
environmentally-friendly absorber which is capable of reducing the amount of pulp,<br>
water-absorbent resin and the like commonly used in sanitary materials.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002] Disposable diapers, sanitary napkins and other sanitary materials have an<br>
absorber body for absorbing bodily fluids and other liquids, a soft, liquid-permeable<br>
top sheet on the side that contacts the body, and a liquid-impermeable back sheet on<br>
the side away from the body. The absorber is normally made from a mixture of pulp<br>
or another fibrous substance and a water-absorbent resin.<br>
There has been increasing demand in recent years for thinner, more<br>
lightweight sanitary materials to resolve problems of design, distribution, garbage<br>
disposal and the like. The most common method currently used to meet these<br>
demands in sanitary materials is to reduce the amount of fiber or other support<br>
material for the water-absorbent resin in the sanitary material and use larger amounts<br>
of water-absorbent resin. Such sanitary materials having a smaller proportion of<br>
hydrophilic fiber and a higher proportion of water-absorbent resin may be better at<br>
simply storing liquid, but are not necessarily good at distributing and dispersing the<br>
1<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
liquid when the diaper is actually used. That is, the large amount of water-absorbent<br>
resin turns into a soft gel when it absorbs liquid, resulting in a phenomenon called gel<br>
blocking which greatly inhibits dispersal of the liquid. Once gel blocking occurs the<br>
resin no longer performs properly, and not only does it absorb less water but<br>
absorption speed decreases.<br>
[0003] The proportions of hydrophilic fiber and water-absorbent resin must both be<br>
restricted in order to avoid this problem and maintain the absorbent properties of the<br>
absorber, so there are limits on reducing the hydrophilic fiber and reducing the<br>
thickness of the sanitary material. Moreover, pulp is most commonly used as the<br>
fiber in sanitary materials, especially virgin pulp is normally used because of its<br>
cleanliness, therefore the use of large quantities of fiber increase of burdens on<br>
forest resources.<br>
[0004] Methods that have been proposed for preventing the gel blocking that occurs<br>
when amount of fiber is reduced and large amounts of water-absorbent resin are<br>
used include a method using two different water-absorbent resins with different<br>
absorption abilities (see for example Patent Document 1), a method using a<br>
composition containing a cationic ion-exchange hydrogel-forming polymer and an<br>
anionic ion-exchange hydrogel-forming polymer (see for example Patent Document<br>
2) a method using a water-absorbent resin crosslink density on the surface of which<br>
is high (see for example Patent Document 3), a method using a water-absorbent<br>
resin the salt density of which near the surface is lower than the overall salt density<br>
(see for example Patent Document 32), and a method extruding and foaming a<br>
mixture of a water-absorbent resin and a thermoplastic resin into a sheet (see for<br>
example Patent Document 4). However, these suffer from such problems as high<br>
cost and inadequate absorption properties for use in an absorber with a high water-<br>
2<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
absorbent resin concentration. Moreover, because these methods reduce the<br>
relative amount of hydrophilic fiber, which serves to hold the water-absorbent resin,<br>
the particles of absorbent resin tend to become unevenly distributed before use or to<br>
move around during use. The absorbent product loses its shape when the water-<br>
absorbent resin shifts from its intended position in this way, and the excreted urine or<br>
other liquid does not contact the water-absorbent resin in the absorbent product,<br>
resulting in leakage.<br>
[0005] In another method, the method of mixing the fiber and water-absorbent resin is<br>
fine-tuned so as to prevent uneven distribution and blocking of one part of the water-<br>
absorbent resin by another part (see for example Patent Document 5). In this<br>
method, the degree of mixing is high because the water-absorbent resin and pulp are<br>
first mixed in water and then dry mixed with hydrophilic fiber and formed into a web<br>
with air. However, the problem is that the water-absorbent resin may clog the web<br>
during the process of air formation. Once this occurs, it becomes necessary to<br>
remove it from the drum, decreases productivity. It is also preferable to use a<br>
relatively hard absorbent resin in order to prevent clogging and facilitate removing<br>
when clogging occurs. In general, hard water-absorbent resins tend to have low<br>
absorption capacity, making it necessary to use a large quantity of water-absorbent<br>
resin in order to absorb the target amount of liquid. This method is also<br>
unsatisfactory in terms of preventing movement and uneven distribution of the water-<br>
absorbent resin in the product.<br>
[0006] In order to resolve these problems, particularly the problem of movement and<br>
uneven distribution of the water-absorbent resin, methods of bonding the water-<br>
absorbent resin onto a support have been studied. Examples include a method of<br>
embossing an absorber, a method in which a thermoplastic binder fiber is included in<br>
3<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
an absorber comprising a water-absorbent resin and hydrophilic fiber, and the<br>
absorbent body is then thermally fused, a method in which a synthetic resin with high<br>
recovery from deformation is included in an absorbent body comprising a water-<br>
absorbent resin and hydrophilic fiber, and the absorbent body is then thermally fused<br>
(see for example Patent Documents 6 and 7), a method in which the surface of a<br>
water-absorbent resin having anionic groups is coated with a cationic polymer, so<br>
that the particles adhere and are fixed to one another as the resin swells (see for<br>
example Patent Document 8 and 9), a method of using an emulsion binder to fix the<br>
water-absorbent resin and hydrophilic fiber, and a method of using a hot melt<br>
adhesive to fix the water-absorbent resin to a base material (see for example Patent<br>
Document 10 and 11) and the like. Because in such examples the particles of water-<br>
absorbent resin are stacked on each other on the support so as to increase the<br>
proportion of water-absorbent resin, the blocking effect is greater and a large quantity<br>
of binder must be used. When a large quantity of binder is used to fix the water-<br>
absorbent resin on the base material in this way, moreover, the binding force itself<br>
may restrict the swelling of the water-absorbent resin. In particular, the inherent<br>
absorbent abilities of the water-absorbent resin may not be fully exploited if the<br>
water-absorbent resin, hydrophilic fiber and the like are fixed with a thermoplastic<br>
binder or emulsion.<br>
[0007] Techniques for reducing restrictions on the swelling of the water-absorbent<br>
resin when it is fixed on a support include a water absorbable composite material<br>
comprising a water-absorbent resin part of which is held within a bulky nonwoven<br>
fabric, while the exposed surface of the resin is coated with fine cellulose fiber and<br>
the outer surface of the composite is covered with a fibrillated hot melt (see for<br>
example Patent Document 12) and an absorbent composite sheet comprising a<br>
4<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
water-absorbent resin part of which is held within a bulky nonwoven fabric and part of<br>
which is exposed on the surface, wherein the outer surface of the resin is coated with<br>
a fiber net-like double hot melt layer consisting of two layers with different sized mesh<br>
(see for example Patent Document 13). However, although swelling is less restricted<br>
with these methods, the absorption properties are affected by the fixing process. As<br>
has already been shown, the absorption properties of water-absorbent resin include<br>
not only the absorption capacity, absorption speed, absorption capacity under<br>
pressure, dispersion-absorption capacity under pressure and liquid permeability of<br>
the swollen gel, but also the capillary absorption factor, which is an absorption<br>
property based on the capillary force in the gaps between particles (see for example<br>
Patent Document 14 and 15). It has been shown that this capillary absorption<br>
capacity and other absorption properties of water-absorbent resin are greatly affected<br>
by conventional fixing means. That is, even using highly functional water-absorbent<br>
resins the absorption properties of absorbent bodies obtained by fixing those resins<br>
often have not reflected the inherent absorption properties of the water-absorbent<br>
resins. It has also been said that it is not necessary to insist so much on the<br>
performance of the water-absorbent resin as long as it fulfills a minimum performance<br>
requirement (see for example Patent Document 16), and differences in the<br>
absorption properties of water-absorbent resin have in fact been hard to distinguish<br>
when the resin is made into an absorbent body, making it hard to differentiate<br>
absorbent bodies.<br>
[0008] In some cases, an adhesive has been used to bond an absorbent gel to a<br>
chemically strengthened cellulose fiber (see for example Patent Document 17). In<br>
this method the chemically strengthened cellulose fiber ensures a space for swelling<br>
of the absorbent gel, effectively separating the water-absorbent resin particles and<br>
5<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
allowing the resin to function more easily. However, the fibers are not fixed to each<br>
other, and the fiber inevitably moves inside the absorbent body, resulting in a<br>
corresponding movement of the absorbent gel. Also, large quantities of cellulose<br>
need to be used because the absorbent gel must be enveloped in cellulose fiber to<br>
ensure space for swelling, and the swelling space itself is not adequate. A large<br>
quantity of adhesive must also be used, which inevitably restricts swelling. Adhesion<br>
has also been accomplished using a base material and a crosslinking agent (see for<br>
example Patent Document 18). In this method, it appears that an absorbent<br>
composite with good liquid permeability has been obtained by using a crosslinking<br>
agent which does not restrict swelling of the gel, along with a low weight of particles<br>
to prevent gel blocking. However, a crosslinking agent is required for adhesion, and<br>
the absorption capacity of the particles could be reduced when some of them are<br>
crosslinked. Moreover, it is also said that performance under load is improved when<br>
the degree of surface crosslinking is increased, but in this case the blocking<br>
prevention effect would not be adequate. In addition, the absorption capacity of the<br>
composite is low because a low weight of particles is used.<br>
[0009] In some cases, a water-absorbent resin has also been fixed to a base material<br>
without using a binder. In one method, absorbent polymer particles are bonded to a<br>
fibrous base material during polymerization, and polymerization is performed on the<br>
fibrous base material (see for example Patent Document 19). In this method, the<br>
fibrous base material penetrates between the polymer particles and the particles are<br>
strongly fixed, but it is difficult to complete the reaction in the base material, and there<br>
is likely to be considerable residual monomer and residual crosslinking agent. In<br>
another example, a certain amount or more of an aqueous monomer solution is<br>
carried as fine particles on a raised nonwoven fabric, and then polymerized and<br>
6<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
thermally compressed (see for example Patent Document 20). The absorption<br>
performance of the composite is high in this case because of the large quantity of<br>
water-absorbent resin, and because a nonwoven fabric is used there is less<br>
movement than with pulp. However, because polymerization is performed in a<br>
nonwoven fabric there is still the problem of residual monomers. Another method is<br>
to re-impregnate a water-absorbent resin with an aqueous solution of unpolymerized<br>
monomer, apply it to a base material and polymerize the impregnated monomer to<br>
thereby bond the water-absorbent resin to the base material (see for example Patent<br>
Document 31), but it is difficult to completely polymerize the residual monomer after it<br>
adheres to the base material, and large quantities of residual monomers occur.<br>
[0010]	In a similar example, the water-absorbent resin is made into a slurry<br>
and applied to a base material (see for example Patent Document 21). Productivity<br>
is certainly improved by applying a slurry, but expensive microfibril fiber must be used<br>
as the dispersion medium, and the adhesive force may not be adequate. In thin<br>
sanitary materials and other absorbent materials with a higher proportion of water-<br>
absorbent resin, because more water-absorbent resin is used the resin can swell and<br>
become rather bulky after absorbing water depending on how it is positioned. The<br>
more strongly the water-absorbent resin is fixed, the more it presses on the body<br>
when it becomes bulky.<br>
[0011] A method has also been proposed of printing drops of low-viscosity aqueous<br>
monomer solution on fabric, and then performing a polymerization reaction with the<br>
fabric to thereby provide gaps between polymerized particles and prevent gel<br>
blocking (see for example Patent Document 30). In this case, large amounts of<br>
residual monomers and low-molecular-weight components remain because of the<br>
difficulty of achieving complete polymerization on a base material. This not only<br>
7<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
makes the product undesirable for use as a sanitary material, but also reduces the<br>
absorption speed. When arranging resin on both sides of one sheet of fabric in an<br>
effort to achieve the desired level of absorption relative to area, moreover, the resin<br>
must have a large particle size of 550 urn or more, and the extremely small surface<br>
area/volume of the spherical, semi-spherical and deformed spherical particles<br>
obtained by this method does not provide sufficient absorption speed for actual use.<br>
[0012] From the standpoint of comfort, it is important to prevent not only leakage but<br>
also dampness in a hygiene product. Absorbent products have been proposed in<br>
which dampness is reduced by controlling the rise in humidity that occurs during use<br>
(see for example Patent Document 22 and 23). In the techniques described in these<br>
publications, the absorbent bodies contain absolute dry pulp, a large quantity of<br>
highly-absorbent polymer and a hygroscopic material such as silica gel or lithium<br>
chloride, in combination with a moisture permeable back sheet. Some absorbent<br>
products also use a moisture permeable back sheet (see for example Patent<br>
Document 24). Another technique combines two moisture permeable sheets in order<br>
to prevent liquid from seeping through the moisture permeable back sheet even<br>
under pressure. However, because in these methods the secreted bodily fluid<br>
remains unfixed between the fibers of the paper or pulp, when a large amount of<br>
bodily fluid is excreted the unfixed liquid may produce steam, resulting in dampness.<br>
[0013] There have also been proposed a sanitary napkin wherein rewetting from the<br>
absorbent body is prevented through the use of an absorbent body in which the<br>
centrifugal holding capacity after equilibrium absorption swelling of false blood and<br>
the false blood permeating speed are at or above a fixed value (see for example<br>
Patent Document 25), a multilayer absorbing paper having a surface layer to be first<br>
contacted with a liquid and made of mixed bulky cellulose fiber and one or more base<br>
8<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
material layers laminated to the surface layer (see for example Patent Document 26),<br>
and an absorbent sheet comprising hydrophilic fine fibers or a hydrophilic fine<br>
powder contained in an absorbent sheet comprising a highly-absorbent polymer and<br>
bulky cellulose fiber (see for example Patent Document 27). However, these<br>
publications do not describe the configuration of an absorbent article that allows<br>
steam to be dramatically controlled and humidity to be dramatically suppressed even<br>
when the amount of excretion (amount of liquid to be absorbed) is large.<br>
[0014] Another method for controlling dampness uses fiber with a low water-holding<br>
capacity for the absorbent layer (see for example Patent Document 28). There is<br>
certainly less dampness with this method, but because the fiber functions hardly at all<br>
as an absorbent body, absorption is dependent entirely on an absorbent resin with a<br>
slow absorption speed, resulting in slower absorption. Because the fiber expands<br>
very little as it swells, moreover, gel blocking is likely and it is difficult for the water-<br>
absorbent resin to perform properly.<br>
[0015] It has been reported that the absorbent capability of a water-absorbent resin is<br>
affected by the shape of the particles (see for example Patent Document 29).<br>
Commonly used water-absorbent resin particles are not especially long and thin and<br>
have a particle diameter of about 45 to 850 urn with a mass median particle diameter<br>
of about 200 to 370 urn, but the absorbent capability of a structure and the effective<br>
capability of the water-absorbent resin in it were improved by means of a relatively<br>
large particle size distribution, with a median particle diameter of 400 to 700 urn.<br>
Conventionally, however, when the absorbent capability is improved the effect of<br>
blocking cannot be avoided because there is more contact between particles.<br>
Because of the low proportion of water-absorbent resin, moreover, the absorbent<br>
capability of the absorbent body is low.<br>
9<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
[0016] Thus, most absorbent bodies in which a water-absorbent resin is bonded to a<br>
base material use adhesion by monomer polymerization (raising the issue of residual<br>
monomers) or adhesion using an adhesive (which restricts swelling), and no<br>
satisfactory adhesion method currently exists. Moreover, only absorbent bodies with<br>
poor performance have been produced because the resin is not in a state that allows<br>
high absorption performance after adhesion. That is, no thin, lightweight absorbent<br>
body has been obtained having high liquid holding capability and absorption speed,<br>
high liquid dispersibility and high stability of the absorbent body.<br>

DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
[0018] It is an object of the present invention to provide a thin, lightweight absorbent<br>
body and bodily fluid-absorbing article with high absorption capability, absorption<br>
speed and dispersibility. In particular, it is an object of the present invention to<br>
provide an absorber and bodily fluid-absorbing article that can be used favorably in<br>
11<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
disposable diapers, sanitary napkins, incontinence pads and the like. More<br>
particularly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an absorber and bodily<br>
fluid-absorbing article which can absorb stably with almost no movement or uneven<br>
distribution of the absorber in a sanitary product, and that can absorb liquid to be<br>
absorbed with a minimum amount of material used. In addition, it is an object of the<br>
present invention to provide an environmentally-friendly absorber and bodily fluid-<br>
absorbing article whereby the pulp and other resources commonly used in hygiene<br>
products can be conserved.<br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS<br>
[0019] As a result of exhaustive research to address the above-identified problem, we<br>
found that high absorption capability could be achieved with a small amount of water-<br>
absorbent resin while reducing the amount of other materials by using an absorbent<br>
composite wherein a base material and water-absorbent resin particles are made into<br>
a composite as the absorber, and the base material and water-absorbent resin<br>
particles are combined in specific proportions and in a specific arrangement.<br>
[0020] That is, the following absorbent composite, method for manufacturing the<br>
absorbent composite and device for manufacturing the absorbent composite are<br>
provided.<br>

EFFECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0023] The present invention is an integrated absorbent composite comprising many<br>
water-absorbent resin particles adhered onto a base material, thereby providing a<br>
thin absorber with high liquid dispersibility and liquid holding capability. By using this<br>
absorber in a sanitary material or other bodily fluid-absorbing article, the process of<br>
manufacturing the sanitary material can be simplified, and the water-absorbent resin<br>
13<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
is utilized efficiently, thus the amount of the water-absorbent resin and paper, fabric<br>
and other materials used in the absorber can be reduced. As a result,<br>
unprecedented thin, lightweight sanitary materials and other bodily fluid-absorbing<br>
articles can be provided.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0024] The present invention is explained in more detail below.<br>
1. Overview of the structure and performance of the absorbent composite of the<br>
present invention<br>
In the present invention, an absorbent composite means a combination of a<br>
water-absorbent resin and a base material. In this composite, 50 wt% or more of the<br>
water-absorbent resin particles adhered directly to the base material, thus there is<br>
little change in the positions of the resin particles. Consequently, the base material<br>
maintains its sheet shape. The absorption capability as an absorber of this<br>
absorbent composite is preferably adjusted by mixing pulp or other short fibers or<br>
other sheet-shaped materials into the absorbent composite.<br>
[0025] In the present invention, the water-absorbent resin particles are preferably<br>
relatively large particles (particle diameter 550 urn to 2100 urn) [hereinafter referred<br>
to as "large particles"], as the absorbent composite using these particles has high<br>
absorption capacity per area and the absorption speed that allows the composite to<br>
be used as a sanitary material. Large particles have conventionally been avoided in<br>
absorber for sanitary materials because of their slow absorption speed, but when<br>
they are directly adhere to the fibers of a base material, the liquid can be transported<br>
inside the particles via the adhered fibers, a stress resulting from morphological<br>
change of fibers in contacting with water are loaded on the adhering large particles,<br>
14<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
and the absorption speed of large particles is dramatically improved, thus allowing<br>
them to be used as constituents of an absorbent product for sanitary materials.<br>
[0026] In arranging the resin particles on the base material, it is preferable to<br>
maintain an area occupancy rate of the large particles to be 1 to 30% on at least one<br>
side, as the swollen resin particles will bump against each other and block each other<br>
from swelling and the resin in the composite will not absorbed adequately if sufficient<br>
space is not provided for the particles to swell in a direction parallel to the plane of<br>
the base material. In this case, it is more preferable to arrange the particles so as to<br>
prevent them from contacting each other, and it is more preferable to space out the<br>
water-absorbent resin particles. Preferably, the water-absorbent resin particles are<br>
arranged in a single layer so that they do not overlap each other. Moreover, the<br>
large particles are preferably arranged on both sides, and maintain the area<br>
occupancy rate of the large particles in the range of 1 to 30% on both sides. If the<br>
composite also contains relatively small particles, they will only swell down below the<br>
large particles without greatly blocking the large particles from swelling, so it is<br>
possible and preferable to adjust the absorption speed to the required speed for the<br>
absorber by adding such small particles. When such relatively small water-absorbent<br>
resin particles are added to adjust the absorption speed, the total surface area<br>
coefficient (explained in detail below) is preferably adjusted to the range of 0.3 to 3 in<br>
order to provide a good balance between absorption capacity and absorption speed<br>
in the composite.<br>
[0027] Since a relatively high absorption capacity is required for purposes of a<br>
sanitary material, the weight ratio of the water-absorbent resin relative to the total<br>
weight of the water-absorbent resin and the base material must be between 65 and<br>
99 wt%.<br>
15<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
[0028] The reason why gel blocking does not occur even with such a high weight<br>
ratio is that 50 wt% or more of the resin particles adhere to the base material, thereby<br>
ensuring a certain space between the resin particles. The proportion of the adhering<br>
resin particles is preferably at least 60 wt%, more preferably at least 70 wt% ,or<br>
further more preferably at least 90 wt% or ideally 95 wt% or more. It is preferable<br>
that the water-absorbent resin particles adhere to the base material, because it can<br>
prevent the water-absorbent resin particles from moving during transportation or<br>
absorption of bodily fluid.<br>
[0029] The method for directly adhering the water-absorbent resin particles to the<br>
base material is not particularly limited. It is preferable that some of the fibers of the<br>
base material are incorporated into the water-absorbent resin particles. It is<br>
preferable that at least 50 wt% of the directly adhering water-absorbent resin<br>
particles are adhere with incorporating some of the fibers therein, and preferably at<br>
least 70%, more preferably at least 90 wt% or still more preferably at least 95% of the<br>
water-absorbent resin are adhere in such a manner. When the water-absorbent<br>
resin particles adhere with incorporating some of the fibers therein, the fibers act as a<br>
conduit when the water-absorbent resin absorbs bodily fluid, the absorption capacity<br>
of the resin particles under pressure as well as the absorption speed increase.<br>
[0030] It is impossible to achieve a high absorption capacity of the absorber merely<br>
by using large particles and thus increasing volume of resin relative to area, and the<br>
resin particles must also have a high absorption capacity. That is, the average<br>
absorption capacity of the water-absorbent resin particles used must be at least 50<br>
g/g. Water-absorbent resin particles having such a high absorption capacity are<br>
generally liable to gel blocking, and their swelling may also be greatly blocked when<br>
the resin particles bump against each other, so an absorbent composite meeting with<br>
16<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
various requirements cannot be achieved just by using a composite with a high resin<br>
proportion of more than 50 wt%. Consequently, in the past it has been necessary to<br>
use hard resin particles with a high degree of crosslinking on the surface and inside<br>
which have a high absorbing capability under pressure and a low absorption capacity.<br>
In the present invention, the water-absorbent resin particles are arranged so as to<br>
avoid gel blocking, and due to the presence of conduits in the resin in some cases,<br>
high absorbing capability under pressure can be achieved even using soft resin<br>
particles with a high absorption capacity. As a result, the absorbent composite has<br>
high absorption capability under pressure or under no pressure.<br>
[0031] Moreover, because the absorbent composite of the present invention has high<br>
bodily fluid dispersibility and makes all of the water-absorbent resin maximize its<br>
absorption capability, an excess of water-absorbent resin need not to be used and<br>
the absorbent composite can be made lightweight. To improve the absorption<br>
capacity of the composite it is preferable to increase the proportion of highly<br>
absorbent resin, and it is more preferable to use a highly absorbent resin with a<br>
higher absorption capacity.<br>
[0032] As is regulated by the voluntary standards of the Japan Hygiene Products<br>
Industry Association regarding the water-absorbent resin, reductions of residual<br>
monomers is required. One feature of the absorbent composite of the present<br>
invention is that the residual monomers in the water-absorbent resin have been<br>
reduced to a dramatically low value of 200 ppm or less. Such a value is hard to<br>
achieve by polymerizing resin on a base material that is commonly used method to<br>
adhere resin directly to a base material. This low level of residual monomers can be<br>
achieved by polymerizing the water-absorbent resin in advance followed by using the<br>
17<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
resin with a specific low level of residual monomers as the water-absorbent resin of<br>
the composite.<br>
[0033] 2. Adhesion<br>
In the present invention, it is preferable that at least 60 wt%, preferably at least<br>
70 wt%, more preferably at least 90 wt%, or still more preferably at least 99 wt% of<br>
the total water-absorbent resin particles are adhere to the base material at the time<br>
when the absorbent composite is used.<br>
In the present invention, the status in which the water-absorbent resin<br>
particles adhere to the base material means the status in which the water-absorbent<br>
resin particles are fixed on the base material, and positional relationship between the<br>
base material and the water-absorbent resin particles does not essentially change.<br>
Specifically, adhering particles means that the particle that is not detached after<br>
shaking back and forth the absorbent composite with the surface having the adhering<br>
particles underneath for one minute at a rate of 2 complete (back and forth) shakes<br>
per second with a shake distance of 20 cm (back (20cm) and forth (20cm)), while<br>
holding the edge of the absorbent composite by hand.<br>
[0034] If the positional relationship between the base material and water-absorbent<br>
particles does not change, the absorption capability of the absorbent composite will<br>
not change due to transportation before use, and this is also preferable from the<br>
standpoint of repeated absorption.<br>
The percentage of adhering particles can be determined by detaching the<br>
adhering particles by force with tweezers or the like and measuring the weight of<br>
them.<br>
18<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
In the present invention, at least 50 wt% of the total water-absorbent particles<br>
adhere directly to the base material at the time when the absorbent composite is<br>
used. Preferably, at least 60 wt%, more preferably at least 70 wt%, still more<br>
preferably at least 90 wt% or ideally at least 99 wt% adhere directly to the base<br>
material.<br>
[0035] Adhere directly, as used herein, means that they adhere without using any<br>
components such as adhesive other than the components including the base<br>
material, the water-absorbent resin particles and derivatives thereof. However, they<br>
are still considered to adhere directly if an adhesive is used to such an extent as not<br>
to inhibit swelling.<br>
The percentage of directly adhering particles can be determined by measuring<br>
the amount of water-absorbent resin particles still adhering after 1 hour of immersion<br>
of the absorbent composite in a solvent that dissolves the adhesive.<br>
[0036] The method for adhering directly is not particularly limited, and includes<br>
adhesion by chemical bonding between the base material and the water-absorbent<br>
resin particles, adhesion by physical interaction and adhesion by incorporating the<br>
fiber into the water-absorbent resin.<br>
Of these, adhesion by incorporating the fiber into the water-absorbent resin is<br>
preferred. Specifically, it is preferable that at least 50 wt% of the total water-<br>
absorbent resin particles adhere with fibers incorporated into the water-absorbent<br>
resin. Preferably at least 60 wt%, more preferably at least 70 wt% or still more<br>
preferably at least 90 wt% of the particles adhere in this manner.<br>
[0037] Fibers incorporated into the water-absorbent resin means that fibers of the<br>
base material are present in the water-absorbent resin matrix. There are no<br>
particular limitations on the shape and length of the incorporated fibers. Because<br>
19<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
water can be taken up into the water-absorbent resin via the fibers, adhesion of this<br>
type provides superior absorption capability from the standpoint of absorbed volume<br>
and absorption speed. An electron microscope can be used to determine whether<br>
the particles adhere with fibers incorporated into the water-absorbent resin. The<br>
proportion can be determined by selecting 30 adhering particles at random,<br>
detaching them by force from the base material, and observing them with an electron<br>
microscope.<br>
[0038] In the present invention, the method of adhesion of the remaining water-<br>
absorbent resin particles does not matter as long as at least 50 wt% of the total<br>
water-absorbent resin particles adhere directly to the base material.<br>
However, it is preferable not to use adhesive from the standpoint of preventing<br>
the blocking of swelling when liquid is absorbed. It is not preferable to use adhesive<br>
because it may block the water-absorbent resin from swelling. Examples of<br>
adhesives include thermoplastic fibers and polymers, emulsion binders, hot melt<br>
adhesives and the like.<br>
[0039] The adhering large particles are preferably arranged with a resin area<br>
occupancy rate (described below) of 1 to 30%. The absorption capability of the large<br>
particles is facilitated if they are arranged in such a way that they do not come in<br>
contact with each other when they absorb the expected amount of liquid. The large<br>
particles may adhere only to one side of the base material or may adhere to both<br>
sides of the base material. It is preferable that they adhere to both sides is desirable<br>
because it increases the absorption amount per unit area.<br>
[0040] 3. Absorbent resin weight ratio<br>
20<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
The weight ratio of the water-absorbent resin in the present invention is given<br>
as the weight percentage of the water-absorbent resin relative to the total weight of<br>
the base material and the water-absorbent resin, and is specifically determined by<br>
the following formula (Formula 1):<br>
(Formula 1)<br>
Weight ratio (wt%) of resin = A/B x 100<br>
(wherein the weight of the water-absorbent resin in the absorbent composite is A (g)<br>
and the total weight of the base material and the water-absorbent resin is B (g)).<br>
[0041] The weight ratio must be at least 65 wt% and not more than 99% at the time<br>
when the absorbent composite is used, and is preferably at least 70 wt% and not<br>
more than 99 wt% or more preferably at least 80 wt% and not more than 99wt%.<br>
The higher the weight ratio, the higher the total amount absorbed by the composite.<br>
The weight of the water-absorbent resin is measured after having detached all of the<br>
particles.<br>
[0042] 3. Resin area occupancy rate<br>
The resin area occupancy rate of the water-absorbent resin particles in the<br>
particle size range from 550 to 2100 urn (that is, large particles) in the present<br>
invention is an indicator of possibility of contact between particles when the<br>
absorbent resin particles have absorbed a liquid. In the present invention, the resin<br>
area occupancy rate of the large particles is measured as follows.<br>
A photograph of the surface of the absorbent composite is taken with an<br>
optical microscope or electron microscope. The measurement conditions and<br>
magnification are set so that the water-absorbent resin can be distinguished from the<br>
base material, and that 10 or more water-absorbent resin particles with a diameter of<br>
21<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
550 to 2100 urn (that is, large particles) appear in one photograph. The enlarged<br>
photocopy of the photograph is prepared, the parts corresponding to the water-<br>
absorbent resin particle are cut out from the parts corresponding to the base, and the<br>
large particles are selected from the water-absorbent resin particle parts. The<br>
following method is used for selection.<br>
Square paper corresponding to a 500 µm - square of on the composite is<br>
prepared by calculating based on the magnification of the photograph and the<br>
magnification of the enlarged copy. Square paper corresponding to a 2500 µm -<br>
square is also prepared in the same way. The large particles are selected by laying<br>
each part of the copy of the water absorbent resin particles over these squares and<br>
excluding those particles whose copies are small enough to fit within the 500 µm -<br>
square or large enough to protrude even slightly from the 2500 µm -square.<br>
The weight of selected cutout parts corresponding to large particles and whole<br>
enlarged copy are weighed, and the resin area occupancy rate of large particles is<br>
calculated based on the following formula (Formula 2). Any five or more points on<br>
the absorbent composite or photographed, and the average is determined to be the<br>
area occupancy rate. When water-absorbent resin particles are adhere to both sides<br>
of the base material, the occupancy rate of each side is determined respectively.<br>
(Formula 2)<br>
Resin area occupancy rate (%) = weight of cutout parts corresponding to large<br>
particles/weight of whole enlarged copy x 100<br>
[0043] The resin area occupancy rate is preferably 1 to 30(%), more preferably 2 to<br>
25, or still more preferably 3 to 20 at the time when the absorbent composite is used.<br>
If the area occupancy rate is too high, the water-absorbent resin particles will contact<br>
with each other when they swell, resulting in blocking so that the water-absorbent<br>
22<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
resin cannot maximize its absorption capability. If the resin area occupancy rate is<br>
too low, the amount of absorption per unit area of the absorbent composite will be<br>
undesirably low.<br>
[0044] 4. Total surface area coefficient<br>
In the present invention, the total surface area coefficient is an indicator of the<br>
surface area of water-absorbent resin particles per unit area of the absorbent<br>
composite. A greater total surface area coefficient is preferable, as the greater the<br>
total surface area coefficient, the faster the absorption speed of the absorbent<br>
composite.<br>
[0045] The total surface area coefficient is preferably about 0.1 to 3, and when<br>
especially rapid absorption is required in the early stages (within first 1 minute after<br>
initiation of use), it is preferably 0.3 to 3, more preferably 0.4 to 3 or still more<br>
preferably 0.5 to 3 at the time when the absorbent composite is used.<br>
[0046] The total surface area coefficient in the present invention is determined<br>
according to (Formula 3) by collecting the water-absorbent resin particles used in the<br>
absorbent composite, classifying them by particle size, measuring the weight and<br>
the bulk density of particles in respective particle size range.<br>
(Formula 3)<br>
Total surface area coefficient = <br>
(wherein Wr is the total weight (g) of water-absorbent resin particles of particle size r<br>
(cm), Cr is the bulk density (g/cm2) of water-absorbent particles of particle size r (cm)<br>
and S is the area (cm2) of the absorbent composite).<br>
23<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
The water-absorbent resin particles are taken out (by peeling when they<br>
adhere to the base material) and collected to measure particle size and bulk density<br>
of the water-absorbent resin particles, and where fibers or the like adheres to the<br>
surfaces of the water-absorbent resin particles, they are removed before<br>
measurement. Where fibers are incorporated into the water-absorbent resin particles,<br>
the fibers on the particle surfaces are cut off before measurement. Where adhesive<br>
or the like has been applied to the surfaces of the water-absorbent resin particles, the<br>
adhesive is removed using a solvent that is not absorbed by the water-absorbent<br>
resin.<br>
The particle size of the water-absorbent resin particles is measured by sieving<br>
them with sieves with a sieve opening of mesh of 106 µm, 212 µm, 300 µm, 425 µm,<br>
500 µm, 600 µm, 710 µm, 850 µm, 1000 µm, 1180 µm, 1400 µm, 1700 µm and 2500<br>
µm. In the present invention, the particle size is determined to be an intermediate<br>
value between the value of sieve opening of two sieves through which a particle<br>
passes and through which it does not pass. The particle size of particles that passes<br>
through a sieve with a sieve opening of 106 µm is determined to be 53 urn, and the<br>
particle size of particles that remains on a sieve with a sieve opening of 2500 µm is<br>
determined to be 2700 µm. By this operation, the particles are classified into particle<br>
sizes of 53 µm, 159 µm, 256 µm, 362.5 µm, 462.5 µm, 550 µm, 655 µm, 780 µm, 925<br>
µm, 1090 µm, 1290 µm, 1550 µm, 1850 µm, 2100 µm and 2700 µm.<br>
The bulk density of the water-absorbent resin particles is determined by<br>
measuring out a 2 cm3 of water-absorbent resin using a 2 cm3 measurement flask,<br>
and dividing the weight in two. The bulk density is measured 5 times, and the<br>
average value is taken. Bulk density is measured for particles in each particle size<br>
grade after having been sieve-classified.<br>

[0047] 5. Water-absorbent resin particles<br>
(Water-absorbent resin)<br>
The water-absorbent resin constituting the water-absorbent resin particles in<br>
the present invention is explained first.<br>
In the present invention, the water-absorbent resin preferably have a residual<br>
monomer concentration of 200 ppm or less, more preferably 100 ppm or less, further<br>
more preferably 50 ppm or less or still more preferably 10 ppm or less relative to the<br>
weight of the water-absorbent resin. It is not preferable that the water-absorbent<br>
resin include residual monomer in high concentration, as they elute during liquid<br>
absorption.<br>
[0048] Residual monomers can be reduced by completing polymerization by heat<br>
treatment either during or after manufacturing the absorbent composite. The residual<br>
monomer concentration of the absorbent resin before contacting with the base<br>
material is preferably 5% or less, more preferably 1 % or less, further more preferably<br>
0.1% or less or still more preferably 0.05% or less. It is not preferable to use the<br>
water-absorbent resin with many residual monomers as a starting material, as it<br>
becomes difficult to complete polymerization during manufacturing the composite,<br>
and a large quantity of residual monomers still remain at the end. The texture of the<br>
base material may also be adversely affected by the polymerization reaction method.<br>
[0049] For such reasons, in the present invention, it is preferable to use amorphous<br>
particles manufactured by a method comprising aqueous solution polymerization<br>
followed by pulverization and/or particles manufactured by reverse-phase suspension<br>
polymerization.<br>
[0050] The amount of residual monomers can be measured by the following method.<br>
25<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
The water-absorbent resin is added to 0.9% saline in the amount of 250 times<br>
the weight of the resin, the residual monomers are extracted for 6 hours by stirring at<br>
room temperature, and filtered. The amount of residual monomers of the filtrate is<br>
determined by liquid chromatography.<br>
[0051] In the present invention, the type of water-absorbent resin is not particularly<br>
limited, and any kind of water-absorbent resin can be used. A water-absorbent resin<br>
having acid groups in the side chains is preferred, and a resin having carboxylic acid<br>
groups in the side chains is especially preferred. It is desirable that 50% or more of<br>
the acid groups are neutralized in the form of salts, and especially desirable that 50%<br>
or more of the acid groups are neutralized in the form of ammonium salts. A water-<br>
absorbent resin having acid groups in the side chain is preferred because the<br>
absorption speed is enhanced due to static repulsion between the acid groups during<br>
liquid absorption. It is desirable for the acid groups to be neutralized because<br>
thereby the liquid is absorbed into the inside of the water-absorbent resin by osmotic<br>
pressure. It is preferable that the acid groups are neutralized in the form ammonium<br>
of salts, because ammonium salts have a high affinity for water and are therefore<br>
more absorbent.<br>
[0052] Many types of water-absorbent resin are known, including crosslinked<br>
partially-neutralized polyacrylic acid (see for example Japanese Patent Application<br>
Laid-open No. S55-84304), hydrolyzed starch-acrylonitrile graft polymer (see for<br>
example Japanese Patent Publication No. S49-43395), neutralized starch-acrylic<br>
acid graft polymer (see for example Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. S51-<br>
125468), saponified vinyl acetate-acrylic acid ester copolymer (see for example<br>
Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. S52-14689), hydrolyzed acrylonitrile<br>
copolymer or acrylamide copolymer (see for example Japanese Patent Publication<br>
26<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
No. S53-15959), polyglutamic acid salts (see for example Japanese Patent<br>
Application Laid-open No. 2003-192794) and the like.<br>
Polyacrylic acid salt copolymers and crosslinked partially-neutralized<br>
polyacrylic acid, which are commonly used for sanitary materials, are preferred from<br>
the standpoint of absorption performance and cost.<br>
[0053] Crosslinked polyacrylic acid is explained below as a desirable example of a<br>
water-absorbent resin, along with a manufacturing method the same.<br>
In crosslinked polyacrylic acid, preferably at least 50 mol%, more preferably at<br>
least 80 mol% or still more preferably at least 90 mol% of the repeating units in the<br>
polymer molecule chains are carboxyl group-containing units. It is not preferable that<br>
the proportion of the carboxyl group-containing unit in the repeating units is 50 mol%<br>
or less because absorption capability is adversely affected.<br>
It is preferable that the carboxyl groups in the polymer molecule chains are<br>
partially neutralized, and alkali metal salt including sodium, potassium and lithium;<br>
and nitrogen-containing basic substance including ammonia may be used as a salt.<br>
Preferably at least 50% and more preferably at least 70% of the carboxyl groups are<br>
neutralized. In terms of the kind of salt, it is preferable that the carboxyl groups are<br>
partially neutralized with at least one salt including ammonia, and it is most<br>
preferable that the carboxyl groups are partially neutralized with ammonia alone.<br>
From the standpoint of absorption capability, at least 50 mol%, more preferably at<br>
least 70 mol%, still more preferably at least 90 mol% or ideally all of the carboxyl<br>
group neutralized salts in the polymer molecule chains are ammonia salts. It is<br>
preferable that the proportion of ammonia salts is high from the standpoint of<br>
absorption capacity and adhesiveness to the base material. The proportion of<br>
ammonia salts in the water-absorbent resin can be calculated from the total amount<br>
27<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
of nitrogen atoms in the water-absorbent resin. The total amount of nitrogen atoms<br>
in the water-absorbent resin can be determined by the Kjeldahl method.<br>
[0054] The monomers constituting the water-absorbent resin may be neutralized salts<br>
of unsaturated carboxylic acid monomers such as (meth)acrylic acid, ethacrylic acid,<br>
itaconic acid, maleic acid, crotonic acid, fumaric acid, sorbic acid, cinnamic acid and<br>
anhydrides thereof, and preferably a neutralized salt of (meth)acrylic acid is used.<br>
The neutralized salt is preferably alkali metal salt including lithium, sodium and<br>
potassium or nitrogen-containing basic substance including ammonia. Other<br>
monomers may also be copolymerized, and examples of unsaturated monomers that<br>
may be copolymerized include anionic unsaturated monomers such as (meth)acrylic<br>
acid, ethacrylic acid, itaconic acid, maleic acid, crotonic acid, sorbic acid, cinnamic<br>
acid , anhydrides thereof, vinylsulfonic acid, allylsulfonic acid, styrenesulfonic acid,<br>
vinyltoluenesulfonic acid, 2-(meth)acrylicamide-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid, 2-<br>
(meth)acryloyl ethanesulfonic acid, 2-(meth)acryloyl propanesulfonic acid, 2-<br>
hydroxylethylacryloylophosphate, 2-hydroxylethyl methacryloyl phosphate, phenyl-2-<br>
acryloyloxyethyl phosphate and vinyl phosphoric acid and salts thereof, nonionic<br>
hydrophilic group-containing unsaturated monomers such as acrylamide,<br>
methacrylamide, N-ethyl (meth)acrylamide, N-n-propyl (meth)acrylamide, N-isopropyl<br>
(meth)acrylamide, N,N-dimethyl (meth)acrylamide, 2-hydroxyethyl (meth)acrylate, 2-<br>
hydroxypropyl (meth)acrylate, methoxypolyethylene glycol (meth)acrylate,<br>
polyethylene glycol mono(meth)acrylate, N-vinylpyrrolidone, N-acryloylpiperidine and<br>
N-acryloylpyrrolidine and, and hydrophilic monomers that yield water-absorbing<br>
property by hydrolysis of the functional groups after polymerization such as methyl<br>
(meth)acrylate, ethyl (meth)acrylate and vinyl acetate that form. Hydrophobic<br>
monomers that may be used in combination include styrene, vinyl chloride, butadiene,<br>
28<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
isobutene, ethylene, propylene, stearyl (meth)acrylate, lauryl (meth)acrylate and the<br>
like, and these may be used singly, or in combination of two or more thereof.<br>
A crosslinking agent may be used with the monomers, and the resin may be<br>
crosslinked by reacting a condensation crosslinking agent with functional groups in<br>
the resin, by copolymerizing a polymerizable crosslinking agent with unsaturated<br>
monomers or by exposing the resin to electron beams or radiation or the like. A<br>
preferred crosslinking method is using a condensation crosslinking agent and a more<br>
preferred crosslinking method is copolymerizing a polymerizable crosslinking agent<br>
with unsaturated monomers in the presence of a condensation crosslinking agent<br>
that reacts with functional groups in the resin.<br>
Examples of condensation crosslinking agents include glycidyl ether<br>
compounds such as ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether, trimethylol propane triglycidyl<br>
ether, (poly)glycerine polyglycidyl ether, diglycerine polyglycidyl ether and propylene<br>
glycol diglycidyl ether; polyvalent alcohols such as (poly)glycerine, (poly)ethylene<br>
glycol, propylene glycol, 1,3-propanediol, polyoxyethylene glycol, triethylene glycol,<br>
tetraethylene glycol, diethanolamine and triethanolamine; polyvalent amines such as<br>
ethylenediamine, diethylenediamine, polyethylenimine and hexamethylenediamine;<br>
and polyvalent ions such as zinc, calcium, magnesium and aluminum, and these<br>
crosslinking agents may be used in combination of two or more.<br>
[0056] Examples of polymerizable crosslinking agents that copolymerize with<br>
unsaturated monomers include diethylene glycol diacrylate, N,N'-<br>
methylenebisacrylamide, polyethylene glycol diacrylate, polypropylene glycol<br>
diacrylate, trimethylol propane diallyl ether, allylglycidyl ether, pentaerythritol triallyl<br>
ether, pentaerythritol diacrylate monostearate, bisphenol diacrylate, isocyanuric acid<br>
29<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
diacrylate, tetraallyloxyethane and diallyloxyacetic acid salt, and these crosslinking<br>
agents may be used in combination of two or more.<br>
[0057] The solvent for the monomer solution is not particular limited as long as it has<br>
excellent dissolving properties. Water alone is particularly desirable, but hydrophilic<br>
solvents such as ethanol, methanol and acetone may also be used either singly or in<br>
combination of two or more. A salt such as sodium chloride, a basic compound such<br>
as ammonia for controlling pH, or a suspending agent in the case of reverse-phase<br>
suspension polymerization may also be added as necessary.<br>
[0058] The method of polymerizing the unsaturated monomers is not particularly<br>
limited, and a commonly used method such as aqueous solution polymerization,<br>
reverse-phase suspension polymerization, reverse-phase emulsion polymerization,<br>
spray polymerization, belt polymerization or the like may be used. The<br>
polymerization initiation method is also not particularly limited, and polymerization<br>
may be initiated by using a radical polymerization initiator, by exposure to radiation,<br>
electron beams or the like, or by using a photosensitizer in ultraviolet polymerization.<br>
The initiator used in radical polymerization may be a known initiator such as for<br>
example a persulfate such as potassium persulfate, ammonium persulfate or sodium<br>
persulfate; hydrogen peroxide; or an organic peroxide such as cumene<br>
hydroperoxide, t-butyl hydroperoxide, peracetic acid or the like. When using an<br>
oxidizing radical polymerization initiator, a reducing agent such as L-ascorbic acid or<br>
Rongalite may also be added.<br>
[0059] An oxygen removal operation is preferably carried out in the monomer solution<br>
prior to initiating polymerization. An example is removing dissolved oxygen by<br>
bubbling or the like with an inactive gas for a sufficient period of time. The<br>
atmosphere in the reaction container is preferably substituted by an inactive gas such<br>
30<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
as nitrogen or helium. The inside of the reaction container may be under reduced<br>
pressure, normal pressure or increased pressure. The polymerization initiation<br>
temperature is generally preferably in the range of 0 to 100°C or more preferably in<br>
the range of 20 to 70°C. If the initiation temperature is too high, polymerization<br>
occurs due to heat before adding the initiator, which is not desirable. A low initiation<br>
temperature is undesirable because reaction initiation takes longer. The temperature<br>
inside the container may be let follow its course during the reaction, or may be<br>
controlled by cooling or heating. The rate of temperature increase and maximum<br>
temperature during polymerization may not be strictly controlled, and the maximum<br>
temperature may exceed 100°C. The maximum temperature during polymerization is<br>
generally in the range of 20 to 140°C or preferably 40 to 120°C. The concentration of<br>
the monomer solution is preferably 10 to 80% or more preferably 30 to 70%. It is not<br>
preferable that the concentration is too high because the reaction tends to get out of<br>
control. It is not preferable that the concentration is too low because the reaction<br>
takes to much time and the subsequent drying step becomes more difficult. It is<br>
preferable to terminate the polymerization when the reaction solution ceases to<br>
generate heat. Since polymerization is followed by heating process, such as drying,<br>
crosslinking and the like, polymerization may also be terminated before the reaction<br>
solution ceases to generate heat. The solution may also be heated or kept warm<br>
after it ceases to generate heat.<br>
[0060] The polymer obtained after above-mentioned polymerization is dried when it is<br>
a wet gel. The drying method is not particularly limited. Azeotropic drying, fluidized<br>
drying, hot air drying, vacuum drying or the like can be preferably used, and hot air<br>
drying or vacuum drying is particularly desirable. The polymer is dried until the water<br>
content become 30 wt% or less or preferably 10 wt% or less. A wet gel may be dried<br>
31<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
in any form, it is preferable to dry the polymer after having increased the surface area<br>
by grounding them coarsely. The drying temperature is preferably in the range of<br>
70°C to 180°C or more preferably 100 to 140°C.<br>
[0061] The particle size of the dried polymer is adjusted as necessary by operations<br>
such as pulverization or classification. When crosslinked polyacrylic acid is used, the<br>
dried polymer may be pulverized into a specific particle size and then be heated. It is<br>
preferable to add a compound having 2 or more functional groups that are capable of<br>
reacting with the carboxyl groups used during this heat treatment. The compound<br>
having 2 or more functional groups capable of reacting with carboxyl groups may be<br>
added before polymerization, or may be added to the particles before heat treatment.<br>
When the compound is added before heat treatment, it is preferable that the<br>
compound is added by dissolving it in a hydrophilic solvent such as water, alcohol or<br>
ether, and dispersing the solution on the surface. The heat treatment temperature is<br>
not particularly limited, and is preferably in the range of 120 to 250°C, more<br>
preferably 150 to 240°C or still more preferably 170 to 230°C. Heat treatment may<br>
be carried out continuously in the same unit after drying, or may be an independent<br>
step from the drying step.<br>
An ordinary dryer or furnace may be used for this heat treatment, and for<br>
example a channel dryer, rotary drier, disc dryer, fluidized bed dryer, air current dryer,<br>
infrared dryer or the like may be used.<br>
[0062] Deodorants, perfumes, various inorganic powders, foaming agents, pigments,<br>
dyes, antibacterial agents, hydrophilic short fibers, plasticizers, adhesives,<br>
surfactants, fertilizers, oxidizing agents, reducing agents, chelating agents,<br>
antioxidants, thermal stabilizers, ultraviolet absorbers, light stabilizers, water, salts<br>
and the like may be added to the water-absorbent resin as necessary.<br>
32<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
Examples of above-mentioned inorganic powders include fine particles of<br>
various inorganic compounds that are inactive with water and hydrophilic organic<br>
solvents and fine particles of clay minerals. Inorganic powders that have a certain<br>
affinity for water but are insoluble or poorly soluble in water are particularly desirable<br>
as inorganic powders, and examples include metal oxides such as silicon dioxide,<br>
titanium; silicic acids (salts) such as natural zeolite, synthetic zeolite; kaolin; talc;<br>
clay; bentonite and the like.<br>
The amount of inorganic powder that is used is normally 0.001 to 10 weight<br>
parts or preferably 0.01 to 5 weight parts per 100 weight parts of water-absorbent<br>
resin. The method of mixing the water-absorbent resin and inorganic powder is not<br>
particularly limited and may be dry blending, wet mixing or the like.<br>
[0063] (Particle shape)<br>
The water-absorbent resin particles may be of any shape, and may be in the<br>
form of spherical particles widely used in absorbent compositions, amorphous<br>
particles, aggregated particles, short fibers, long fibers or particle with sheet shape.<br>
Amorphous particle obtained by pulverization, particle aggregates (such as grape<br>
clusters), particle with scale shape, granules and the like may also used. Preferred<br>
particles include aggregated particles, spherical particles or amorphous particles.<br>
However, a water-absorbent resin that is used as large particles is preferably<br>
in the form of amorphous particles manufactured by polymerization by aqueous<br>
solution polymerization followed by pulverization, and/or particle aggregates<br>
manufactured by reverse-phase suspension polymerization. This is because that it is<br>
hard to achieve a satisfactory absorption speed for sanitary materials with spherical<br>
particles due to their extremely low specific surface area even if the absorption speed<br>
is increased due to the composite effect with the base material,<br>
33<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
[0064] (Salt concentration near the surface)<br>
The salt concentration of the water-absorbent resin particles near the surface<br>
before adhering to the base material (hereinafter referred as "surface salt<br>
concentration") is preferably at least 50 mol%, more preferably at least 60 mol%,<br>
further more preferably 70 mol% or still more preferably at least 80 mol%. The<br>
adhesiveness of the particles is low if the surface salt concentration before adhering<br>
to the base material is too low.<br>
[0065] The ultimate surface salt concentration of the water-absorbent resin particles<br>
in the absorbent composite after adhering to the base material is not particularly<br>
limited , but it is preferably 90 mol% or less, more preferably 80 mol% or less or still<br>
more preferably 60 mol% or less. It is advantageous that the surface salt<br>
concentration of the water-absorbent resin particles in the final composite is low<br>
because it reduces stickiness of the product that is exposed to humid air. This is also<br>
extremely desirable because the dispersibility of aqueous solution in the absorbent<br>
composite can thus remain high even if the particles contact each other during<br>
swelling after the composite absorbs an aqueous solution. To maintain a high<br>
absorption capacity, it is necessary to increase the salt concentration of the<br>
absorbent resin particles as a whole, but to maintain high liquid dispersibility in the<br>
composite, it is better to have a lower salt concentration near the surface. That is, it<br>
is desirable that the surface salt concentration is reduced while the internal salt<br>
concentration is increased. Specifically, the surface salt concentration is preferably<br>
at least 10 mol% lower, more preferably at least 20 mol% lower or further more<br>
preferably at least 30 mol% lower than the salt concentration at the center of the<br>
resin. "Near the surface" means the outer layer of a thickness of about 1 um from the<br>
surface of the resin. It is desirable to adjust the salt concentration near the surface at<br>
34<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
the same time as the resin is adhered to the base material because a high level of<br>
balance between adhesiveness and absorbability can thus be obtained.<br>
[0066] The water-absorbent resin normally consists of acid groups such as carboxyl<br>
groups, sulfonic acid groups and neutralized salts thereof, and basic groups such as<br>
amino groups and neutralized salts thereof and the like. The surface salt<br>
concentration of the water-absorbent resin particles means the proportion of<br>
neutralized groups of the surface part of the water-absorbent resin particles. In the<br>
present invention, the salt concentration near the surface of the resin particles can be<br>
determined by microscopic ATR, a method of infrared absorption analysis. Since<br>
ATR generally provides structural information about the surface layer to a depth of 1<br>
urn, the degree of neutralization of the resin particle surfaces can be measured<br>
directly by microscopic ATR. The degree of neutralization of the inner part is<br>
measured by microscopic ATR after cutting open the resin and exposing the center<br>
by using an ultramicrotome (Reichert, Ultracut N). A Bio-Rad FTS-575 is used for<br>
measurement.<br>
[0067] A polyacrylic acid water-absorbent resin is used as an example below. In<br>
order to determine the ratio of carboxylic acid and carboxylate, the peak area ratio<br>
(1695/1558 cm-1) of peak area at 1695 cm-1 (carboxylic acid v C=O base materialise<br>
1774-1616 cm-1) and peak area at 1558 cm-1 (carboxylate v COO- base materialise<br>
1616-1500 cm-1) was calculated. The ratio is determined based on calibration curve<br>
that was prepared by measuring standard samples of partially crosslinked polyacrylic<br>
acid neutralized by 10 mol%, 30 mol%, 50 mol%, 70 mol%, 90 mol% or 100 mol%<br>
with ammonia.<br>
[0068] (Surface strength)<br>
35<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
The water-absorbent resin particles before being adhered to the base material<br>
preferably have a surface strength of 0.1 to 5.5 N, more preferably 0.1 to 5 N, further<br>
more preferably 0.2 to 4 N or still more preferably 0.2 to 3 N. A surface strength is a<br>
parameter indicating the tendency to be deformed of the particle surfaces. When<br>
water-absorbent resin particles that have absorbed to certain times and have swollen<br>
are placed in a container and subjected to load, the gel moves and deforms so as to<br>
fill in the gaps between the water-absorbent resin particles, which are packed in the<br>
container with gaps between them. Since surface strength is the elastic module of<br>
the water-absorbent particles when they have absorbed liquid and become to their<br>
actual volume, it signifies the degree of interaction between gel particles and the<br>
tendency to be deformed on their surface. If the surface strength of the water-<br>
absorbent resin particles is high, it means that the water-absorbent resin particles are<br>
not easily deformed. If the particles are not easily deformed, a strong negative force<br>
against swelling is generated when the water-absorbent resin particles absorb liquid,<br>
and thereby decrease the absorption capacity. If the surfaces are not easily<br>
deformed, the area of adhesion between the resin and base material is reduced, and<br>
thereby yield detachment of the particles from the composite. The surface strength<br>
of the water-absorbent resin particles of the present invention is determined as<br>
follows.<br>
Equipment: Shimadzu Autograph AG-1<br>
Sample: 0.10 g of water-absorbent resin particles are weighed precisely<br>
and distributed uniformly on the bottom of a cylindrical container with a height of 50<br>
mm and an inner diameter of 20.5 mm on the bottom of which is pasted a nylon<br>
sheet with a pore size of 75 µm. A Petri dish with a diameter of 50 mm is prepared<br>
36<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
and filled with 0.90 g of saline, and the cylindrical container containing the water-<br>
absorbent resin particles is left in the Petri dish to absorb and swell for 1 hour.<br>
Measurement: 1 kN load cell is prepared, and a cylindrical shaft with a<br>
diameter of 19.7 mm is attached to it. The measurement range is set at 0.2 kN, and<br>
starting from the height at which there is no load on the load cell, it is set to descent<br>
at a fixed rate of 0. 6 mm/minute. The pressure loaded on the load cell is measured<br>
over time. Surface strength is indicated by the load (N) at the point when the<br>
particles become actual volume. The actual volume of the water-absorbent resin<br>
particles was calculated based on the relative density of saline of 1.010 g/cm3 and<br>
the relative density of the water-absorbent resin particles.<br>
[0069] (Absorption capacity)<br>
In the present invention, the average absorption capacity of the water-<br>
absorbent particles in the composite must be at least 50 g/g, and is preferably at<br>
least 60 g/g or more preferably at least 70 g/g.<br>
In the water-absorbent resin particles of the present invention, moreover, the<br>
absorption capacity of the water-absorbent resin under load or pressure of 0.8 psi is<br>
preferably at least 20 g/g, more preferably at least 25 g/g or still more preferably at<br>
least 30 g/g. It is desirable for the water-absorbent resin particles to have a high<br>
absorption capacity because the quantity of water-absorbent resin particles used can<br>
then be reduced.<br>
[0070] In the present invention, the absorption capacity of the water-absorbent resin<br>
particles means the amount of 0.9% saline that the water-absorbent resin particles<br>
can absorb by freely swelling under the condition that no loads is loaded on the<br>
water-absorbent particles. The absorption capacity of the water-absorbent resin<br>
particles is measured by the following method.<br>
37<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
0.05 g of water-absorbent resin particles are placed uniformly in a nonwoven<br>
pouch similar to a tea bag (60 x 40 mm), and immersed in 0.9% saline at 23°C. 180<br>
minutes later, the tea bag is taken out, and obliquely-suspended with its corners fixed<br>
for 10 minutes to drip, and the weight is measured. A same measurement is carried<br>
out for the sample without water-absorbent resin particles, and the measured weight<br>
is given as the blank. The absorption capacity is calculated using (Formula 4). The<br>
value is measured 3 times, and the average of them is given as the absorption<br>
capacity.<br>
(Formula 4)<br>
Absorption capacity of water-absorbent resin particles (g/g) = {(weight of tea<br>
bag after absorption) - (weight of blank tea bag after absorption) - (weight of water-<br>
absorbent resin particles)}/(weight of water-absorbent resin particles).<br>
[0071] The absorption capacity under pressure of the water-absorbent resin particles<br>
of the present invention is measured as follows. 0.02 g of water-absorbent resin<br>
particles are placed in an acrylic resin tube with a inner diameter of 25 mm and a<br>
height of 30 mm having a 250-mesh nylon nonwoven fabric on the bottom, a<br>
smoothly moving cylinder is placed in the tube to make it the measurement device,<br>
and the weight is measured. Load is applied by placing a 278.33 g load<br>
(corresponding to 0.8 psi) on top of the cylinder of the measurement device, and the<br>
device is placed in a 120 mm Petri dish containing 60 g of 0.9% saline. After 60<br>
minutes the measurement device is taken out and left for 3 seconds on a Kimtowel to<br>
drain off water, the device is weighed after unloading the load, and the absorption<br>
capacity under pressure is calculated according to (Formula 5).<br>
(Formula 5)<br>
38<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
Absorption capacity (g/g) of water-absorbent resin particles under load =<br>
(weight (g) of the device after absorption - weight (g) of the device before<br>
absorption)/(weight of water-absorbent resin particles)<br>
An absorbent composite with a tensile breaking strength of 0.6 (N/20 mm) or<br>
more comprising water-absorbent resin particles with an absorbent capacity of 70 g/g<br>
or more and an absorbent capacity under load of 0.8 psi of 20 g/g or more is<br>
desirable for sanitary material applications such as disposable diapers because it<br>
exhibits excellent absorption properties both under no pressure and under pressure.<br>
Preferably the water-absorbent composite consists of water-absorbent resin particles<br>
and paper and/or fabric, and more preferably each water-absorbent resin particle is<br>
arranged with a space between each other so that blocking of the particles does not<br>
occur, and still more preferably 90 wt% or more of the water-absorbent resin particles<br>
adhere to paper and/or fabric. Water-absorbent resin particles having an absorption<br>
capacity under no pressure of 70 g/g or more and an absorption capacity under load<br>
of 0.8 psi of 20 g/g or more can be obtained by the following methods. They can be<br>
obtained by polymerizing unsaturated carboxylic acid monomers 70% or more of<br>
which are acrylic acid, wherein 50% or more of the carboxyl groups are neutralized<br>
as ammonium salts and 70% or more of the total monomers are neutralized. In this<br>
case, monomers include a compound having 2 or more unsaturated groups in one<br>
molecule that acts as a crosslinking agent in the amount of 0.0005 to 0.1 mol% of the<br>
total monomer components. 0.1 to 3 weight parts of a compound having two or more<br>
functional groups that can react with carboxyl groups may be used during any step<br>
either before or after polymerization. Radical polymerization is carried out by using a<br>
redox-type initiator, and the radical polymerization initiator is used in the amount of<br>
0.005 to 0.5 mol% of the amount of unsaturated monomers. Reducing agent is used<br>
39<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
in the amount of 0.0001 to 1 g per 1 mole of monomer. Heating is also carried out as<br>
necessary under the conditions that fulfill (Formula 6) below. This heating is<br>
preferably carried out on the absorbent composite during the manufacturing process<br>
of it rather than on the water-absorbent resin particles alone.<br>
(Formula 6)<br>
Y = -1.6X + 345<br>
(wherein Y is the heating time (minutes) and X is the heating temperature (°C)).<br>
As the water-absorbent resin particles obtained in this way have a tendency to<br>
cause blocking, they show inferior results especially in the absorption speed and<br>
absorption capacity under pressure if they are measured by a conventional method in<br>
which the water-absorbent resin particles are in close contact with each other.<br>
However, the water-absorbent resin particles show excellent results in any of<br>
absorption speed, absorption capacity under no pressure and absorption capacity<br>
under pressure if they are measured by the above-mentioned method of the present<br>
invention in which they can maximize their absorption capability.<br>
[0072] (Particle size)<br>
The weight-average particle size of the water-absorbent resin particles used in<br>
the present invention is preferably 100 to 2700 µm, more preferably 100 to 2100 µm<br>
or still more preferably 200 to 2100 µm or ideally 200 to 1400 µm. It is not preferable<br>
that the average particle size is too small from the standpoint of absorption capability.<br>
On the other hand, it is not preferable that the average particle size is too large, as it<br>
is difficult to adjust the total surface area coefficient within the desired range.<br>
[0073] In the present invention, the particle size of the water-absorbent resin particles<br>
is determined by sieve classifying with sieves with a sieve-opening of 106 µm, 212<br>
µm, 300 µm, 425 µm, 500 µm, 600 µm, 710 µm, 850 µm, 1000 µm, 1180 µm, 1400<br>
40<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
µm, 1700 µm and 2500 µm. In the present invention, the particle size is determined<br>
to be the intermediate value between the values for sieve-openings in the sieves<br>
through which the particles pass and through which they cannot pass. The particle<br>
size of particles that pass through a sieve with a sieve-opening of 06 µm is<br>
determined to be 53 µm, and the particle size of particles that remains on a sieve<br>
with a sieve-opening of 2500 µm is determined to be 2700 µm. By this operation,<br>
the particles are classified into 53 µm, 159 µm, 256 µm, 362.5 µm, 462.5 µm, 550 µm,<br>
655 µm, 780 µm, 925 µm, 1090 µm, 1290 µm, 1550 µm, 1850 µm, 2100 µm or 2700<br>
µm.<br>
[0074] The proportion of the water-absorbent resin particles in the composite of the<br>
present invention that pass through a sieve with a sieve-opening of 300µm is<br>
preferably 50% or less, more preferably 40% or less. The proportion of particles that<br>
cannot pass through a sieve with a sieve-opening of 3000 µm is preferably 10% or<br>
less, more preferably 5% or less.<br>
[0075] The particle size distribution of the water-absorbent resin particles in the<br>
absorbent composite of the present invention is closely related to the absorption<br>
capability of the absorbent composite. For example, the absorption speed tends to<br>
increase as the average particle size decrease, and the degree of swelling in the<br>
direction perpendicular to the base material and the absorption amount per unit area<br>
tend to increase as the average particle size increase. Comparing resin particles of<br>
the same weight, the area occupancy rate of the resin tends to decrease as the<br>
average particle size increases, and thus blocking of swelling is less likely to occur.<br>
The absorption speed of particles alone is too slow if the particle size is too large, but<br>
the absorption speed of large particles in the composite of the present invention is<br>
enhanced by the combination effect with fibers, thus it is preferable to use relatively<br>
41<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
large particles. From the standpoint of both absorption capacity and absorption<br>
speed, it is desirable to use both relatively large particles with a particle size of 550<br>
urn or more and relatively small particles with a particle size of 300 µm or less, and<br>
preferably there are two or more peaks in the particle size distribution of the particles<br>
in the composite. The particle sizes of the two peaks preferably differ by a factor of 2<br>
or more, more preferably 3 or more or still more preferably 4 or more. If there is a<br>
difference in the particle size, the particles are packed as close as closest packing,<br>
and the large particles and the small particles do not contact with each other when<br>
they swell, and each particle will be able to maximize its absorption capability.<br>
[0076] (Large particles)<br>
Large particles are preferably used in the absorbent composite of the present<br>
invention. Large particles are particles with a particle size of 550 to 2100 µ. Larger<br>
particles are more desirable for purposes of increasing the absorption capacity of the<br>
absorbent composite per unit area, but the absorption speed become very slow if the<br>
particles are too large, and they may cause a problem of pain or the like by sticking<br>
out when they are used in the absorber of a hygiene product. Consequently, the size<br>
of the large particles is preferably 655 to 1850 µm, more preferably 780 to 1550 µm<br>
or still more preferably 925 to 1290 µm.<br>
[0077] Since the absorption speed of these large particles is greatly affected by their<br>
shape, they are preferably pulverized amorphous particles produced by a method<br>
comprising pulverization, and/or aggregated particles produced by reverse-phase<br>
suspension polymerization. Particles other than pulverized amorphous particles or<br>
aggregated particles whose specific surface area (surface area/volume) is smaller<br>
than these may cause a reduction in the absorption speed.<br>
42<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
[0078] Aggregated particles used herein means aggregate formed by aggregation of<br>
two or more particles with an average particle size in the range of 10 to 550 µm<br>
(hereinafter refers as primary particles). The particle size distribution of the primary<br>
particles does not need to be uniform, and the primary particles may include partiµcles<br>
with a particle size of exceeding 550 µm or below 10 µm. That is, it is sufficient that<br>
the average particle size of the primary particles before aggregation be in the range<br>
of 10 to 550 µm. It is desirable that the average particle size of the primary particle is<br>
small because it increases the absorption speed of the large particles. On the other<br>
hand, it is desirable that the average particle size of the large particle is large<br>
because it reduces the particle surface area after swelling, thereby reducing the<br>
contact area of the water-absorbent resin with the external and preventing the users<br>
from feeling coldness of the water-absorbent resin. This is also desirable because it<br>
prevents swollen resin from penetrating through the sheet between the absorbent<br>
composite and the body to the skin even when the swollen primary particles become<br>
detached. Consequently, the most desirable average particle size of the primary<br>
particles is 200 to 500 µm.<br>
[0079] The salt concentration near the surface of the large particles is preferably 10<br>
mol% or more, more preferably 20 mol% or more, or still more preferably 30 mol% or<br>
more lower than the salt concentration at the center of the resin. Where pulverized<br>
amorphous particles are used, it is particularly preferable to increase the absorption<br>
speed by transporting water into the inside of the particles using ion osmotic effect<br>
caused by a salt concentration difference between the surface and the center,<br>
because the specific surface area of large particles is smaller than that of aggregated<br>
particles. It is also preferable to crosslink the surface of the particles in order to<br>
reduce the blocking effect that blocks liquid from dispersing into the inside of the<br>
43<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
particles caused by swelling of the particle near its surface during absorption. When<br>
aggregated particles are used as the large particles, the absorption speed may be<br>
reduced by gel blocking effect of the constituent primary particles that prevent water<br>
from penetrating into inside of the large particles. Consequently, it is desirable to<br>
reduce the gel blocking effect by making the surface of the swollen particle dry by<br>
reducing the salt concentration near the surface of the primary particles, or by<br>
crosslinking near the surface of the primary particles.<br>
[0080] In the absorbent composite of the present invention, the absorption capacity<br>
and absorption speed of the absorbent composite are preferably adjusted by using<br>
both large particles and other water-absorbent resin particles, and in this case the<br>
average particle size of the mixed resin particles is preferably in the range of 10 to<br>
2700 µm, more preferably 100 to 1000 µm or still more preferably 200 to 550 µm.<br>
When resin particles other than large particles are included in the composite of the<br>
present invention for the purpose of improving absorption speed, it is desirable to<br>
include many water-absorbent resin particles with relatively small particle size. In this<br>
case, the content of particles that pass through a sieve with a sieve opening size of<br>
300 µm is preferably 10 to 50 wt% based on the total water-absorbent resin particles<br>
in the absorbent composite. If the water-absorbent resin particles are too small the<br>
absorbent capability will be lower, therefore the content of water-absorbent resin<br>
particles with a particle size of less than 100 µm is preferably 10 wt% or less. More<br>
preferably, the content of water-absorbent resin particles with a particle size of less<br>
than 212 µm is preferably 10 wt% or less.<br>
[0081] 6. Base material<br>
A base material in the present invention means a material that can maintain a<br>
sheet form.<br>
44<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
(Material)<br>
In the present invention, the base material may be of any material that is in<br>
sheet form, but preferably it is of paper and/or fabric. Paper used herein means<br>
paper broadly defined by JISP0001, and fabric is a general term for sheet-shaped<br>
fiber products as defined by JISL0206. Fabric is classified into woven fabric, knitted<br>
fabric, lace, mesh and nonwoven fabric depending on the means of forming the sheet.<br>
Woven, knitted or nonwoven fabric is preferably used in the present invention and<br>
nonwoven fabric is particularly preferable. Paper and/or fabric are desirable because<br>
they have morphologic stability, unlike pulp and other short fibers. Nonwoven fabric<br>
is defined by JIS L 0222.<br>
[0082] The material of the base material is not particularly limited, and more than one<br>
material may be combined. The base material fibers may be natural fibers or<br>
synthetic fibers, and multiple types of fibers may also be combined. The fibers may<br>
be either long or short. They may also be treated to increase strength or<br>
hydrophilicity. Hydrophilic fibers are more desirable than hydrophobic fibers from the<br>
standpoint of liquid absorption and water permeability. Continuous long fibers are<br>
also desirable than short fibers because they are excellent in liquid permeability.<br>
Of the hydrophilic base materials, a cellulose base material is particularly<br>
desirable. In the present invention, a cellulose base material means a fabric and/or<br>
paper that are made mainly from cellulose, and a fabric and/or paper made of<br>
cellulose fiber, especially a nonwoven cellulose fabric, is desirable. A cellulose<br>
derivative obtained by esterification or etherification can be used as the cellulose. It<br>
may also be mixed with other fibers. Kinds of cellulose include natural fibers such as<br>
cotton and hemp, and reclaimed fibers such as rayon, polynosic, Lyocell and cupra<br>
45<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
and the like. A reclaimed fiber, especially reclaimed fiber made from the annual<br>
cottonseed, is preferred.<br>
[0083] (Shape)<br>
The shape of the base material is not particularly limited, and the thickness is<br>
preferably 0.001 mm to 1 cm, more preferably 0.01 mm to 5 mm, still more preferably<br>
0.05 mm to 3 mm or ideally 0.1 mm to 1 mm. The weight is preferably 0.1 g/m2 to 1<br>
kg/m2, more preferably 0.5 g/m2 to 500 g/m2 or still more preferably 1 g/m2 to 100<br>
g/m2. From the standpoint of strength, the material that is too thin or too light is not<br>
preferable.<br>
[0084] (Tensile breaking strength)<br>
In the present invention, the tensile breaking strength after absorption of saline<br>
is preferably at least 0.6 N/20 mm, more preferably 0.6 to 5000 N/20 mm, still more<br>
preferably 0.7 to 500 N/20 mm or yet more preferably 0.85 to 100 N/20 mm or ideally<br>
1 to 100 N/20 mm.<br>
[0085] In the present invention, the direction in which the strength of the material is<br>
maximum is defined as lengthwise direction and the direction perpendicular to this<br>
direction is defined as crosswise direction, and the strength is preferably within the<br>
aforementioned range in the crosswise direction (that is, both in the lengthwise<br>
direction and in the crosswise direction).<br>
[0086] In the present invention, the tensile breaking strength of the base material<br>
after absorption of saline means the tensile breaking strength that is measured after<br>
having made the base material absorb saline. A sanitary material sometimes<br>
continues to be used after having absorbed liquid without being changed. It may<br>
also be required to absorb liquid multiple times after having once absorbed liquid. If<br>
the absorber continues to be used after having absorbed liquid, it becomes to be in<br>
46<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
the same situation where it is under load with keeping water in it. If the base material<br>
breaks due to the load, the liquid permeability and liquid dispersion properties are<br>
adversely affected, and the absorption capability is adversely affected. It is<br>
preferable that the base material maintains its strength even after having absorbed<br>
saline from the standpoint of durability of the absorber. It is preferable that the base<br>
material has high strength, because it is disadvantageous to have low strength when<br>
the manufacturing process of the composite includes a process in which the base<br>
material absorbs water. However, the absorption capability does not further<br>
improved by using an excessively strong base material.<br>
[0087] The tensile breaking strength after absorption of saline is determined as<br>
follows.<br>
Sample: 15 cm x 2 cm rectangular base material (various kinds with<br>
different directions are prepared)<br>
Equipment: Tensile Tester (Shimadzu Autograph)<br>
Methods: 700 g of 0.9% saline is taken in a 1 L beaker, and the base<br>
material is immersed therein for 10 minutes. The base material is pulled out and left<br>
on a Kim towel for 1 minute, then is fixed on the equipment at the points 2.5 cm<br>
inside from each edge so that the space between the points to be pulled is 10 cm,<br>
and the base material is pulled at a speed of 10 mm/minute until it breaks. The force<br>
at the time of break is recorded, and the maximum value is determined to be strength<br>
N/20 mm. If the base material has different strength depend on measurement<br>
direction, measurements are carried out for some different measurement directions.<br>
[0088] (Absorption capacity, absorption speed)<br>
Absorption capacity and absorption speed are indicators of the hydrophilicity<br>
and liquid permeability of the base material. These are explained below.<br>
47<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
In the present invention, the absorption capacity of the base material means<br>
the factor by which the base material increases in weight after having absorbed 0.9%<br>
saline over 60 minutes, and is specifically measured as follows.<br>
A circular piece with a diameter of 59.5 mm is cut out from the base material<br>
and weighed, and a wire is passed through it 1 cm inside from the edge. 500 g or<br>
more of saline is provided at 23°C in a 1 L beaker, and the base material is immersed<br>
in the saline together with the wire. After 60 minutes, the base material is taken out<br>
from the saline together with the wire, and suspended for 10 minutes without<br>
contacting with anything else. After 10 minutes, the wire is removed and the total<br>
weight of the wet base material and water adhering thereto is measured.<br>
[0089] The absorption capacity of the base material is shown by (Formula 7).<br>
(Formula 7)<br>
Absorption capacity of base material (g/g) = weight after absorption (g)/weight<br>
before absorption (g)<br>
In the present invention, the absorption capacity of the base material is<br>
preferably at least 6 g/g and not more than 200 g/g, more preferably at least 8 g/g<br>
and not more than 100 g/g, still more preferably at least 10 g/g and not more than 50<br>
g/g or ideally at least 12 g/g and not more than 30 g/g.<br>
Because in the absorbent composite the fiber has a faster absorption speed<br>
than the water-absorbent resin particles, the base material absorbs in the early stage<br>
of absorption and the water-absorbent resin particles absorbs in the late stage of<br>
absorption. It is desirable for the base material to have a higher absorption capacity<br>
because this means a faster liquid absorption speed in the early stage. Because the<br>
base materials generally absorb by capillary action, the liquid may be released under<br>
load, causing humidity during use. However, if the resin particles adhered with the<br>
48<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
fibers of the base incorporated therein, the water-absorbent resin absorbs liquid by<br>
capturing liquid from the base. As a result, there is little rewetting under load or<br>
steaminess during use.<br>
[0090] In the present invention, the absorption speed of the base material means the<br>
speed at which the base with a width of 2cm absorbs 0.9% saline in perpendicular<br>
direction.<br>
The absorption speed of the base material is preferably at least 0.35 mg/sec<br>
and not more than 100 mg/sec, more preferably at least 0.45 mg/sec and not more<br>
than 50 mg/sec, further more preferably at least 0.55 mg/sec and not more than 30<br>
mg/sec or still more preferably at least 0.65 mg/sec and not more than 10 mg/sec.<br>
[0091] Specifically, the absorption speed of the base material is measured as follows.<br>
Sample: 10 cm x 2 cm rectangular base<br>
2 or more samples are prepared with different directions if it has a lengthwise<br>
direction and a crosswise direction.<br>
Equipment: Electronic scale, 90 mm dia. Petri dish<br>
Methods: The Petri dish is placed on the electronic scale, and the base<br>
material is suspended vertically 10 cm above the Petri dish. The Petri dish is taken<br>
out from the scale, and filled with 60 g of 0.9% saline which was measured out with<br>
another scale. The Petri dish is replaced on the scale with the bottom of the base<br>
material being held by hand not to be in contact with the saline, and the scale is set<br>
to 0. The base material is carefully immersed in the saline, and the value of the scale<br>
is measured over time. The time (seconds) and the absolute value (mg) of the scale<br>
are plotted on a graph, and the gradient (mg/sec) between 120 and 240 seconds is<br>
determined to be the absorption speed. If the base material has directions, several<br>
49<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
measurements are carried out for different directions, and the fastest value is<br>
determined to be the absorption speed.<br>
[0092] It is preferable that the absorption speed of the base material is different<br>
depend on directions. This is because in this case, liquid permeability is excellent in<br>
a particular direction and liquid disperses easily in the particular direction, thus the<br>
balance of absorption can be controlled in the absorber.<br>
[0093] (Ratio of tensile breaking elongation and strength in the lengthwise direction<br>
and in the crosswise direction)<br>
When the base material has directions, the strength and elongation are<br>
different depend on direction. As mentioned above, in the present invention, the<br>
direction in which the strength is maximum refers to as the lengthwise direction and<br>
the direction perpendicular to the lengthwise direction refers to as the crosswise<br>
direction.<br>
The ratio of tensile breaking strength in the length direction and the crosswise<br>
direction is preferably at least 1.2:1, more preferably at least 1.5:1 and still more<br>
preferably at least 2:1, but not more than 10:1.<br>
The ratio of tensile breaking elongation in the lengthwise direction and<br>
crosswise direction is preferably at least 1:1.2, more preferably at least 1:1.5 and still<br>
more preferably at least 1:2, but not more than 1:10. The elongation and strength of<br>
the base material can be determined in the same way as the strength of the base<br>
material after having absorbed saline by tensile testing with the base material in a dry<br>
state, not immersed in saline. The tensile test is continued until the base material<br>
breaks, and the force at which it exhibits maximum strength is determined to be the<br>
strength of the base material and the elongated distance at that time is determined to<br>
be the elongation.<br>
50<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
[0094] (Contact angle)<br>
The base used in the present invention is preferable a nonwoven fabric with a<br>
contact angle of 130° or less.<br>
In the present invention, the contact angle is defined as the angle formed after<br>
a 44% aqueous ammonium polyacrylate solution with a viscosity of 74 cps is made<br>
be in contact with the base material at room temperature for 10 minutes. The angle<br>
is measured using a contact angle meter (CA-X150) made by FACE (Kyowa<br>
Interface Science). The solution is prepared by adjusting the viscosity of a 44%<br>
aqueous ammonium polyacrylate solution (70 to 110 cp) from Wako Pure Chemical<br>
with water. Viscosity is measured with a rotating disc viscometer.<br>
The contact angle is preferably 130° or less , more preferably 120° or less, still<br>
more preferably 110° or less or ideally 100° or less. The affinity between the base<br>
material and water and the affinity between the base material and water-absorbent<br>
resin increase as the contact angle decreases, and thereby increase the absorption<br>
capability and adhesiveness.<br>
[0095] 7. Method for manufacturing absorbent composite<br>
The absorbent composite of the present invention is made from water-<br>
absorbent resin particles and a base material, and is preferably manufactured by a<br>
method including a step of adhering the water-absorbent resin particles to the base<br>
material.<br>
The adhering method is not particularly limited, and may be one that fulfills the<br>
conditions mentioned above.<br>
Examples of adhering methods including methods in which the water-<br>
absorbent resin is entangled with the base material and methods using adhesives,<br>
51<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
and a preferred method is one in which the water-absorbent resin and/or the base<br>
material is made to absorb 10 to 3000 weight parts of water per 100 weight parts of<br>
water-absorbent resin, and the water is then removed while the water-absorbent<br>
resin is in contact with the base material. The amount of water is preferably 20 to<br>
2000 weight parts or more preferably 50 to 1000 weight parts per 100 weight parts of<br>
water-absorbent resin particles. This method of adhering is preferred because it<br>
does not require an adhesive, which becomes an impurity. In this method some of<br>
the fibers are also incorporated into the water-absorbent resin, which is desirable<br>
from the standpoint of absorption speed and absorption capacity. It is preferable to<br>
use more water, as it increases adhesiveness, but using too much water is inefficient<br>
because it takes longer to dry.<br>
[0096] The water to be absorbed may contain impurities. Examples of impurities<br>
include cations such as sodium ions, ammonium ions and water-soluble organic<br>
compounds such as iron ions, and chlorine ions and other anions, and acetone,<br>
alcohols, ethers and amines. An acidic or basic substance may be used to adjust the<br>
pH of the water-absorbent resin and/or absorbent composite. From the standpoint of<br>
contact between the water-absorbent resin and base material and absorption<br>
capability, it is desirable to use ion-exchange water or distilled water without<br>
impurities alone.<br>
[0097] It is preferable to dissolve and/or disperse a substance having a deodorant or<br>
other function in the water to thereby functionalize the resulting absorbent composite.<br>
Examples of deodorants that can be used in this case include organic and inorganic<br>
deodorants. When using a deodorant that is insoluble in water, it is desirable to use<br>
a dispersant or surfactant as necessary. An inorganic deodorant can also be<br>
dispersed in water without using a dispersant by reducing the particle size to the<br>
52<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
nanometer level, therefore it is preferable to use a fine-particle inorganic deodorant<br>
without a dispersant.<br>
[0098] The wetting method is not particularly limited, and examples include<br>
immersing in a water bath, spraying with water, making be in contact with a wet body,<br>
exposing to humidification and the like. Of these, the water spraying method is most<br>
preferred because it is industrially simple and easy to adjust the water content. It is<br>
preferable to use a water spraying system which provides a uniform water content in<br>
the fabric or other base material. If the water content varies widely with location of<br>
the base material, the particle size of the resin in the dried water absorbent<br>
composite become nonuniform, as the amount of water the water-absorbent resin<br>
particles absorb after they come in contact with the base material and before the<br>
drying step starts differ by location, and the foaming behaviors caused by removal of<br>
water in the drying step will differ by location The texture of the absorbent<br>
composite with nonuniformly-sized resin particles may not good.<br>
[0099] In wetting the base material and adhering to the water-absorbent resin<br>
particles, the water content of the base material is preferably in the range of 50 to<br>
500 wt%. It is preferable to increase a water content to increase the adhesiveness<br>
between the water-absorbent resin particles and the base material, but if the water<br>
content is too large, the drum used in manufacturing method mentioned below will<br>
be covered with large amount of water and it will cause the problem that the water-<br>
absorbent resin particles adhere to other parts of the drum than the dimples. Of<br>
course, if the water content is too low, adhesiveness between the base material and<br>
the resin will be adversely affected. Therefore, the water content is preferably in the<br>
range of 50 to 200 wt% or more preferably 80 to 150 wt%.<br>
53<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
[0100] In order to wet the base material, the water-absorbent resin particles may<br>
contain water for adhering, but since this makes the water-absorbent resin more<br>
likely to adhere to other objects than the base, the water-absorbent resin particles<br>
before adhering are preferably dried to the extent that they do not adhere to other<br>
objects or to other resin particles. The water content of the water-absorbent resin<br>
particles in this case is preferably 1 to 50 wt% or more preferably 5 to 30 wt%.<br>
[0101] Examples of contacting methods include scattering the water-absorbent resin<br>
particles on the base material from above, holding the water-absorbent resin particles<br>
in the dimples on the surface of a drum followed by transferring the water-absorbent<br>
particles in the dimples to the surface of the base material, and filling the inside of a<br>
drum roll having surface dimples with water-absorbent resin particles followed by<br>
expelling the particles from the drum and putting them onto the base material with<br>
pressure. A Preferred method is the one that allows the water-absorbent resin<br>
particles to be arranged so that they do not contact with each other after swelling,<br>
because it maximize the absorption capability of the water-absorbent resin particles.<br>
[0102] Any method can be used for removal of water. Examples include drying by<br>
heating, blowing dry air or nitrogen, vacuum drying, freeze drying, azeotropic drying,<br>
fluid drying, microweb drying and the like, and drying by heating is preferred. The<br>
heating conditions are preferably 1 to 1000 seconds at 70 to 350°C, more preferably<br>
1 to 1000 seconds at 100 to 340°C, still more preferably 1 to 1000 seconds at 120 to<br>
330°C or ideally 1 to 1000 seconds at 150 to 300°C. The higher the temperature the<br>
shorter the drying time, but the absorption capability of some types of resin may be<br>
adversely affected by long-term heating at high temperatures. Surface treatment<br>
such as crosslinking may be applied at the same time as drying. Removal of water<br>
may be carried out at any stage before completion of the final product, and is<br>
54<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
preferably carried out shortly after wetting in order to avoid deterioration of the water-<br>
absorbent resin.<br>
[0103] (Preferred method for manufacturing the absorbent composite)<br>
One desirable example of a method for manufacturing the absorbent<br>
composite of the present invention is explained below.<br>
Figure 1 is an explanatory diagram of a desirable manufacturing device for<br>
manufacturing the absorbent composite of the present invention. The base material<br>
supplied from the original fabric roll (a) is made into wet base material (c) using a<br>
device such as a water sprayer (b). Then resin particles are blown onto one surface<br>
of the wet base material from a rotating drum for adhering resin particles (e1) in the<br>
dimples on which resin particles (f) supplied from resin particle feed part (d1) are<br>
placed. Then resin particles are blown onto another surface of the wet base material<br>
from a rotating drum for adhering resin particles (e2) in the dimples on which resin<br>
particles (f) supplied from resin particle feed part (d2) are placed. Then small-sized<br>
resin particles are dispersed uniformly from small resin particle feed part (i) to adjust<br>
the absorption capabilities of the absorbent composite, and the base material with<br>
resin particles adhere to both surfaces is dried by passing through drying part (g) to<br>
give a composite with resin particles strongly adhere thereto.<br>
In the method described above, the structure of the rotating drum for adhering<br>
resin particles which arranges the water-absorbent resin particles on the base<br>
material is important. The drum surfaces have, at pre-determined positions, multiple<br>
dimples into which the water-absorbent resin particles can be inserted. These<br>
dimples are preferably arranged so as to reduce the probability that the water-<br>
absorbent resin particles come in contact with each other. There is an optimal<br>
arrangement of dimples that maximizes the absorption capability of the absorbent<br>
55<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
composite. This is an arrangement whereby spaces are provided between adjacent<br>
resin particles to allow them to swell by absorption, and whereby more water-<br>
absorbent resin particles can be arranged on the base material.<br>
[0104] In this manufacturing method, the outer diameter of the opening of the dimples<br>
on the surface of the drum is preferably 1 to 3 times, more preferably 1.2 to 2 times<br>
the maximum diameter of the supplied water-absorbent resin particles. The outer<br>
diameter of the opening of the dimple on the drum as used in this explanation means<br>
the largest value of the distances between any two points on the peripheral border of<br>
the opening on the surface of the drum.<br>
[0105] If the outer diameter of an opening is too large, it is difficult to operate stably,<br>
as multiple water-absorbent resin particles may be inserted into a single dimple or<br>
the water-absorbent resin particles once inserted in the dimple will be more likely to<br>
fall out of the dimples . On the other hand, if the outer diameter of the opening is too<br>
small, water-absorbent resin particles in the dimples may be removed in removing<br>
water-absorbent resin particles that adhere to other parts than the dimples due to<br>
static electricity or the like even when the particles are held into the dimples with<br>
sucking force.<br>
[0106] Regarding the structure of the dimple, the peripheral border on the surface of<br>
the drum surface may take any form including non-angular shape such as circular<br>
and oval, angular shape such as triangular, rectangular and pentagonaland infinite<br>
shape. A definite non-angular or angular shape is preferable from the standpoint of<br>
manufacturing the drum, and a non-angular shape is desirable from the standpoint of<br>
manufacturing the drum and inserting and removing the particles from the dimples.<br>
[0107] Regarding the structure of the dimple from the peripheral border on the<br>
surface of the drum towards the inside of the drum, the dimples may have the same<br>
56<br><br>
A0501 0VP32W/YA<br>
space from the surface to the inside, or may be wider on the inside than on the<br>
surface, or may be narrower on the inside than on the surface. From the standpoint<br>
of ease of insertion and removal of the water-absorbent resin particles, it is desirable<br>
that the space of the dimples be narrower on the inside than on the surface.<br>
[0108] The depth of each dimple on the drum is preferably 0.3 to 2 times, more<br>
preferably 0.5 to 1.5 times or still more preferably 0.7 to 1.2 times the average<br>
particle size of the water-absorbent resin particles supplied to the drum. If the<br>
dimples are too shallow, water-absorbent resin particles in the dimples may be<br>
removed in removing water-absorbent resin particles that adhere to other parts than<br>
the dimples due to static electricity or the like even when the particles are held into<br>
the dimples with sucking force. If the dimples are too deep, multiple water-absorbent<br>
resin particles may be inserted into one dimple, making it difficult to adjust the<br>
amount of resin adhere to the resulting absorbent composite, and it may also be<br>
more difficult to remove the water-absorbent resin particles after insertion, interfering<br>
with stable operation.<br>
[0109] The drum used in this manufacturing method preferably has a hole at the<br>
bottom of each dimple on the surface of the drum through which the gas which is<br>
used to blow out the water-absorbent resin particles can pass. The inner diameter of<br>
the hole is preferably smaller than the size of the small-sized particles of water-<br>
absorbent resin supplied to the drum. If the holes are larger than the small-sized<br>
particles, particles smaller than the holes may pass through the holes into the inside<br>
of the drum instead of being blown onto the base material, and may be accumulated<br>
in the drum and cause problems for operation. The holes may be of any structure as<br>
long as they can let the gas through effectively from the inside of the drum to the<br>
outside of the drum. In order to avoid clogging of holes with the water-absorbent<br>
57<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
resin particles, it is preferable that the holes have the structure wider towards the<br>
inside of the drum.<br>
[0110] In inserting the water-absorbent resin particles into the drum, it is preferable<br>
that the particles are inserted under suction condition by depressurizing the inside of<br>
the drum. The pressure difference between the outside and inside of the drum in this<br>
case is preferably in the range of 0.01 to 500 Torr. If this pressure difference is too<br>
small, the particles inserted into the dimples fall out easily. On the other hand, if it is<br>
too large, too many particles enter the dimples and they are hard to expel. Therefore,<br>
this pressure difference is preferably in the range of 0.05 to 100 Torr, more preferably<br>
0.1 to 50 Torr or still more preferably 0.5 to 5 Torr. This method with suction is<br>
extremely desirable because it not only increase the probability of the water-<br>
absorbent resin particles being inserted into the dimples, but also can prevent water-<br>
absorbent resin particles in the dimples from falling out in removing particles<br>
adhering to other parts than the dimples on the drum after inserting the particles into<br>
the dimples until blowing out them onto a hydrophilic fabric support.<br>
[0111] For this manufacturing method, it is preferable to provide a system for<br>
removing the water-absorbent resin particles that adhere to other parts of the drum<br>
than the dimples after inserting the water-absorbent resin particles into dimples on<br>
the drum until blowing out them onto the base material. The removal method is not<br>
particularly limited, and examples include sweeping with a brush, blowing a gas and<br>
using vibration. Of these methods, blowing a gas is most desirable.<br>
[0112] It is preferable to provide a device for removing static electricity from the drum,<br>
because the drum generates static electricity which destabilize the movement of the<br>
water-absorbent resin particles during operation.<br>
58<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
It is preferable to apply the water-absorbent resin of various particle sizes to<br>
adjust the total surface area coefficient and the like after having arranged the large<br>
particles with large particle size using the drum. These particles may be applied to<br>
only one surface, or may be applied to the both surfaces of the fabric by reversing<br>
the fabric followed by applying the particles to another surface as well. To avoid<br>
detachment of the particles, it is desirable to once again apply water to the base<br>
material before said application of the particles. The method for applying particles<br>
is not particularly limited and is preferably one that can apply them uniformly.<br>
[0113] It is preferable to convey the base material in this manufacturing method. The<br>
method of conveying the base material in this case is not particularly limited.<br>
Examples of the method of conveying the base material include those in which the<br>
base material is conveyed without any support from above or below and those in<br>
which the base material is conveyed along with a conveyor belt or other support that<br>
supports it from below. When the water-absorbent resin particles adhere to both<br>
surfaces of the base material, it is preferable to introduce a conveyor belt system for<br>
the step to convey the surface of the base material to which the particles adhere later<br>
under the surface of the drum for adhering. This is because it can prevent resin<br>
already adhering to the reverse surface of the base material from falling off when the<br>
water-absorbent resin particles are being blown out from the drum. It is also<br>
desirable to use a conveyor belt system during the final step of removing water and<br>
drying. This is because it can minimize the shrinkage of the base material that may<br>
occur during removing water from and drying the base material.<br>
[0114] It is preferable that the water-absorbent resin particles used in this<br>
manufacturing method have a high salt concentration on the particle surfaces<br>
because this results in stronger adhesion when they are blowing out onto the base<br>
59<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
material. However, it is not preferable that the salt concentration of the surface is too<br>
high in the final product. That is, it is desirable to adjust the salt concentration of the<br>
particle surface of the water-absorbent resin particles after having adhered the water-<br>
absorbent resin to the base material. From the standpoint of productivity, it is better<br>
to adjust the salt concentration simultaneously with the drying step rather than<br>
separately after the drying step. The salt concentration of the particle surfaces is<br>
preferably at least 10% less, more preferably at least 20% less or more preferably at<br>
least 30% less compared to the concentration before the treatment.<br>
[0115] 8. Performance of absorbent composite<br>
(Absorption capacity)<br>
In the present invention, the absorption capacity of the absorbent composite<br>
means the amount of 0.9% saline absorbed during 3 hours of free absorption.<br>
Specifically, a circular absorbent composite with a diameter of 59.5 mm is prepared,<br>
and the absorption capacity is measured by the same methods used to measure the<br>
absorption capacity of the base material. When there are water-absorbent resin<br>
particles that do not adhere or when detachment of the particles has occurred, the<br>
water-absorbent resin particles are collected by filtration and left for 10 seconds on a<br>
Kimwipe to remove excess water, and count their weight into the measurement. In<br>
measuring the capacity of the absorbent composite in which almost 50 wt% of the<br>
water-absorbent resin particles do not adhered, the absorbent composite is placed in<br>
a T-Bag and measured according to the method for measuring the absorption<br>
capacity of the water-absorbent resin particles.<br>
The absorption capacity of the absorbent composite is preferably at least 40<br>
g/g, more preferably at least 45 g/g or still more preferably at least 50 g/g.<br>
60<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
[0116] (Absorption amount per unit area)<br>
Absorption amount per unit area is important as an indicator of the absorption<br>
capability of the absorbent composite. Absorption amount per unit area is calculated<br>
according to (Formula 8) based on the measurement results above.<br>
(Formula 8)<br>
Absorption amount per unit area (g/cm2) = (total weight after absorption (g) -<br>
weight of the absorbent composite (g))/area of the absorbent composite (cm2)<br>
It is preferable that the absorption amount per unit area is high, and it is<br>
preferable to be not less than 0.4 g/cm2, more preferably not less than 0.7 g/cm2, or<br>
further more preferably not less than 1 g/cm2.<br>
[0117] (Absorption capacity under pressure)<br>
The absorption capacity of the absorbent composite of the present invention<br>
under pressure is represented as the amount of 0.9% saline absorbed during 3 hours<br>
of absorption under load. Specifically, it is measured as follows using a circular<br>
absorbent composite with a diameter of 59.5 mm.<br>
The measurement device is explained roughly with reference to Figure 2. As<br>
shown in Figure 2, the measurement unit comprises scale 1, container 2 placed on<br>
the scale 1, outer air suction pipe 3, conduit 4, glass filter 6 and measurement part 5,<br>
which is placed on glass filter 6. Container 2 has opening 2a at the top and opening<br>
2b on the side. Outer air suction pipe 3 is inserted into opening 2a, while conduit 4 is<br>
attached to opening 2b. Container 2 also contains a predetermined amount of saline<br>
12. The lower end of outer air suction pipe 3 is immersed in saline 12. Glass filter 6<br>
is formed with a diameter of 70 mm. Container 2 and glass filter 6 are connected to<br>
each other via conduit 4. The position of glass filter 6 is adjusted so that its height to<br>
be the same as the lower end of outer air suction pipe 3. As shown in Figure 3,<br>
61<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
measurement part 5 has filter paper 7, support cylinder 9 and weight 11. Advantec<br>
No. 2 with a diameter of 60 mm is used for filter paper 7. In measurement part 5,<br>
filter paper 7 and support cylinder 9 are placed on glass filter 6 in this order, with<br>
weight 11 placed inside of support cylinder 9. Support cylinder 9 has an inner<br>
diameter of 60 mm. The weight of weight 11 is adjusted so that it can apply a<br>
uniform load of 0.8 psi on absorbent composite 13. The absorbent capacity under<br>
pressure of an absorbent composite was measured using a measurement unit of this<br>
configuration. The measurement method is explained below. First, the necessary<br>
preparations were made including filling container 2 with a predetermined amount of<br>
saline 12, and inserting outer air suction pipe 3 into container 2. Filter paper 7 was<br>
then placed on glass filter 6. Concurrently, absorbent composite 13 was placed<br>
inside of support cylinder 9, and weight 11 was placed on this absorbent composite<br>
13. Next, support cylinder 9 was placed so that its center was aligned with the center<br>
of glass filter 6. After placing support cylinder 9, the weight W (g) of the saline 12<br>
absorbed by absorbent composite 13 was measured every 10 seconds using scale 1.<br>
The absorption capacity under pressure of the absorbent composite was determined<br>
according to (Formula 9).<br>
(Formula 9)<br>
Absorption capacity under pressure of absorbent composite (g/g) = weight W<br>
(g)/weight of absorbent composite (g)<br>
[0118] The absorption capacity under pressure of the absorbent composite under<br>
load of 0.8 psi is preferably at least 15 g/g, more preferably at least 16 g/g or still<br>
more preferably at least 18 g/g. The absorption amount per unit area can also be<br>
determined in the same way of the absorption amount per unit area under no<br>
pressure. The absorption amount per unit area under pressure of 0.8 psi is<br>
62<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
preferably 0.1 g/cm2, more preferably at least 0.15 g/cm2 or still more preferably at<br>
least 0.2 g/cm2.<br>
[0119] An absorbent composite with an absorption capacity of 40 g/g or more, an<br>
absorption capacity under pressure of 15 g/g or more under load of 0.8 psi and a<br>
tensile breaking strength of 0.6 (N/20 mm) or more is highly absorbent and strong<br>
and can be used favorably in disposable diapers and other sanitary materials. The<br>
absorption capacity is preferably at least 45 g/g, more preferably at least 50 g/g or<br>
still more preferably at least 55 g/g. The absorption capacity under pressure of 0.8<br>
psi is preferably at least 16.5 g/g, more preferably at least 18 g/g or still more<br>
preferably at least 20 g/g.<br>
[0120] (Absorption capacity after 1 minute)<br>
The absorption capacity after 1 minute is an indicator of the initial liquid<br>
absorption speed. Because in sanitary material applications such as disposable<br>
diapers, bodily fluid needs to be absorbed instantly, it is preferable to have higher<br>
absorption capacity after 1 minute. The absorption capacity after 1 minute is<br>
determined according to (Formula 10). Specifically, it is measured by the following<br>
method.<br>
A piece with a length of 2 cm and a width of 7 cm is cut out from the<br>
absorbent composite, and weighed. A 1000 cc glass beaker is filled with 700 cc of<br>
saline. A T-Bag with a length of 80 cm and width of 70 cm is weighed, and the T-Bag<br>
alone is made to absorb water for 1 minute, centrifuged, and then weighed. This<br>
weight is divided by the weight of the T-Bag before absorption to give the absorption<br>
capacity after 1 minute of the T-Bag. A T-Bag of the same size is weighed and the<br>
absorbent composite is placed therein. In order that the T-Bag can be quickly pulled<br>
out from the liquid, a clip with a string attached is prepared and attached to the T-Bag,<br>
63<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
which is then carefully and quickly immersed in the liquid so that the fabric does not<br>
bend or twist. After 1 minute of immersion, it is quickly pulled out by pulling the string.<br>
The clip is removed, and the bag is centrifuged at 150 G for 3 minutes and then<br>
weighed. The absorption capacity after 1 minute is determined by subtracting the<br>
amount absorbed by the T-Bag from the total weight, and dividing the result by the<br>
weight of the absorbent composite before absorption. Centrifugation is initiated<br>
within 15 seconds after the absorbent composite is pulled out from the liquid.<br>
(Formula 10)<br>
Absorption capacity after 1 minute (g saline/g) = (weight after centrifugation<br>
(g) - weight of T-bag (g) * absorption capacity after 1 minute of T-Bag)/weight of<br>
absorbent composite (g)<br>
[0121] (Bending resistance)<br>
The bending resistance of the absorbent composite is determined by the<br>
bending resistance D method (heart loop method) described in JIS L1096. The<br>
values of front surface and back surface are different when the particle sizes and<br>
distribution are different on the front and back, and in the present invention the value<br>
of softer one, or in other words the higher value, is determined to be the bending<br>
resistance. The bending resistance is preferably 90 mm or less or more preferably<br>
85 mm or less.<br>
[0122] 9. Method for using absorbent composite<br>
A preferred method for using the absorbent composite of the present invention<br>
is using as a constituent element of a bodily fluid-absorbing article. The use of the<br>
composite as a constituent element of a bodily fluid-absorbing article is explained<br>
below.<br>
64<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
[0123] (Bodily fluid-absorbing article)<br>
In the present invention, the bodily fluid-absorbing article means a bodily fluid-<br>
absorbing article comprising a liquid-permeable sheet, a liquid impermeable sheet,<br>
and the absorbent composite sandwiched between them, and it includes all articles<br>
with the ability to absorb bodily fluids. There are no particular limitations on the<br>
bodily fluids absorbed in the present invention, and examples include urine,<br>
menstrual blood, mother's milk, soft stool and the like. There are also no particular<br>
limitations on the shape of the article, and desirable examples include pads, tapes,<br>
pants and the like. Examples include diapers, sanitary napkins, incontinence pads,<br>
lactation pads and the like.<br>
[0124]When combined with a liquid-permeable sheet and a liquid-impermeable sheet,<br>
the absorbent composite of the present invention can form part of a bodily fluid-<br>
absorbing article that has a high bodily fluid-absorbing capability while being thin and<br>
lightweight. Because there is little risk of the absorber moving or slipping in the<br>
bodily fluid-absorbing article during use, moreover, it can stably absorb bodily fluid.<br>
In addition, because the proportion of water-absorbent resin is higher than that in<br>
conventional bodily fluid-absorbing articles, the amount of absorbed liquid that is<br>
released under load (rewetting) is small, and the worn part remains comfortable.<br>
[0125] In the present invention, the liquid-permeable sheet may be anything as long<br>
as it is in sheet shape and water poured on the sheet permeates through it, and<br>
preferably it is a fabric such as that defined by JIS L0206. Fabric is classified as<br>
woven fabric, knit fabric, lace, mesh and nonwoven fabric according to the means of<br>
forming the sheet, and preferred fabric used in the liquid-permeable sheet of the<br>
present invention includes woven, knitted or nonwoven fabric and more preferred<br>
fabric is nonwoven. It is preferable to use a sheet with a low water-absorbing ability<br>
65<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
made of polyethylene, polypropylene or other polyolefin in order to reduce feel of the<br>
moisture and improve feel of the sheet against user's skin, and it is preferable to use<br>
a sheet made of polyolefin that has been given a water-permeability or hydrophilicity<br>
by treatment in order to rapidly transport bodily fluid.<br>
[0126] A liquid-impermeable sheet in the present invention can be anything that is in<br>
sheet form and is impermeable to water. A material with good gas permeability is<br>
preferred for preventing dampness.<br>
[0127] It is sufficient for the bodily fluid-absorbing article of the present invention to<br>
have at least a liquid-permeable sheet, a liquid-impermeable sheet and an absorbent<br>
composite sandwiched between them, but other materials may also be present<br>
between the liquid-permeable sheet and the absorbent composite and/or between<br>
the liquid-impermeable sheet and the absorbent composite. Another material may<br>
also be present outside the liquid-impermeable sheet or liquid-impermeable sheet.<br>
Materials that can be used in this case include fibrous materials such as pulp,<br>
particulate materials such as water-absorbent resins, sheet-shaped materials such<br>
as tissue, fabric, paper, and the like. These materials may also adhere to the water-<br>
absorbent composite of the present invention. These materials may adhere with<br>
adhesive, or they may adhere directly to the water-absorbent resin particles of the<br>
absorbent composite of the present invention. A bodily fluid-absorbing article<br>
preferably includes tape or elastic for fixing the article to the user's body, gathers for<br>
preventing leakage from the side and the like.<br>
[0128] The shape of the bodily fluid-absorbing article of the present invention may be<br>
a square or circle, a rectangle or oval or a combination of trapezoids, or may have an<br>
irregular shape. A rectangle or oval or a similar shape having a longer direction and<br>
a shorter direction (direction perpendicular to the longer direction) is desirable when it<br>
66<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
is used for a diaper, sanitary napkin, incontinence pad or the like, as they fit to the<br>
crotch of user. Figure 4 shows an illustrative example of the shape of an absorbent<br>
composite having a longer direction. There may also be a part that serves as an<br>
overlap width for jointing the composite to another part.<br>
[0129] Where the absorbent composite include an overlap width that does not contain<br>
water-absorbent resin thereon, it is preferable that the proportion of the water-<br>
absorbent resin and the area occupancy rate of the absorbent composite are<br>
adjusted to the desired range not counting the overlap width.<br>
[0130] The absorbent composites may be used singly or in the combination of two or<br>
more in the articles more than one. It is preferable to use only one composite in<br>
order to make a thin product. In order to make a product with greater absorbing<br>
ability, it is preferable to use more than one. When more than one composite are<br>
used, they can be used in piles or in lines. They may also be of exactly the same<br>
shape or different shapes. To improve the absorbing capability efficiently, they are<br>
preferably overlapped only in the areas where bodily fluids are excreted to, and in<br>
order to prevent leakage, they are overlapped in the areas where leakage is likely to<br>
occur.<br>
[0131] There are no particular limitations on the posture of the absorbent composite<br>
in the bodily fluid-absorbing article, and the absorbent composite sheet may be<br>
completely spread out, or may be wrinkled or folded.<br>
[0132] (Folding of absorbent composite in bodily fluid-absorbing article)<br>
When the absorbent composite of the present invention is used as a<br>
constituent element of a bodily fluid-absorbing article, the edge of the absorbent<br>
composite is preferably folded over to prevent leakage of bodily fluid from the edge.<br>
The edge used herein means the area within 15 cm from the periphery of the<br>
67<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
absorbent composite sheet. The folded part is not particularly limited as long as it is<br>
within 15 cm from the periphery and it is preferably within 12 cm, more preferably 8<br>
cm or still more preferably 5 cm or ideally 3 cm. In the present invention, the posture<br>
that the absorbent composite is folded over means that a part of the absorbent<br>
composite is not on the same plane of the absorbent composite, when the absorbent<br>
composite is stretched without using excess force and attached to a board with<br>
thumb tacks.<br>
[0133] The fold may be towards the liquid-permeable sheet as shown in Figure 5 or<br>
towards the liquid-impermeable sheet as shown in Figure 6. When another part is on<br>
a still different plane from the first fold as shown in Figure 7, that part is called the<br>
second fold.<br>
[0134] The composite may be folded once, twice, or many times. Multiple folds are<br>
more effective for preventing leakage, but result in extra thickness, so the number of<br>
folds should be set so as not to detract from the shape of the composite. When<br>
multiple folds are used, their directions and angles can be determined at will. They<br>
may be alternating concertina folds as in Figure 8, or continuous folds in the same<br>
direction as in Figure 9. A part that has been folded once can be folded over again to<br>
form a double fold as in Figure 10. A triple or greater fold is also possible. As shown<br>
in Figure 11, the fold does not have to be a flat fold.<br>
[0135] A fold along the edge of the absorbent composite prevents leakage because it<br>
has thickness and acts as a physical barrier for the dispersing liquid. Moreover, the<br>
folded part can also prevent leakage of liquid after the liquid has reached it, because<br>
the folded part has a higher absorption capability than the unfolded part.<br>
[0136] The absorbent composite may be folded around the full circumference, or only<br>
part Where the shape of the absorbent composite has a long direction and a short<br>
68<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
direction, such as a rectangle, oval or similar shape, leakage is more likely to occur in<br>
the shorter direction, and leakage can therefore be prevented with the minimum<br>
amount of folding by folding only the long sides of the absorbent composite. In this<br>
case the absorbent composite is preferably either formed with a part for folding as in<br>
Figure 12 A, or with slits to allow folding as in Figure 12 B. When it is known where<br>
bodily fluid needs to be absorbed, it is effective to locate the fold on the edge near<br>
that area. In Figure 12, the dotted area is the folded area.<br>
[0137] The length of the folded part is not particularly limited but is preferably at least<br>
2 cm, more preferably at least 5 cm, still more preferably at least 7 cm or ideally at<br>
least 10 cm. The longer the fold, the greater the leakage-prevention effect.<br>
Folding may be at one location or at more than one location. The folds may<br>
be continuous, or there may be multiple folded areas with gaps between.<br>
The folds may be of any width, but the overlapping part formed by the fold is<br>
preferably 0.1 to 100 mm, more preferably 1 to 70 mm, still more preferably 5 to 40<br>
mm or ideally 5 to 20 mm in width. If the fold is too narrow it will have little leakage<br>
control effect, on the other hand and little advantage is gained by making it too wide.<br>
In the present invention, when the bodily fluid-absorbing article is spread out<br>
on a flat board without excess force and the four corners are fixed with thumb tacks,<br>
the angle of folding is the angle between the plane of the bodily fluid-absorbing<br>
particle and a straight line between the point immediately before the folds leaves the<br>
plane of the bodily fluid-absorbing article and the furthest point from that plane.<br>
When there are multiple folds, only the first fold is considered. Angles of folding are<br>
shown in Figures 5, 6 and 11. The angle of folding is preferably greater than 0°C and<br>
is more preferably at least 30° or still more preferably at least 60° or ideally at least<br>
90°.<br>
69<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
[0138] The folded part may be fixed with an adhesive. Fixing the folded part with an<br>
adhesive is desirable because it prevents slippage of the absorbent composite. The<br>
adhesive may be applied on the inside of the folded part to attach the absorbent<br>
composite to itself, or may be applied on the outside to attach the absorbent<br>
composite to the liquid-permeable sheet, to the liquid-impermeable sheet or to<br>
another member.<br>
[0139] The absorbent composite may be folded alone, or with the other members.<br>
When the absorbent composite is folded with the other members, it is preferable that<br>
the other material is in sheet form.<br>
[0140] (Adhesive used in bodily fluid-absorbing article)<br>
The adhesive is preferably applied lineally in the effectively lengthwise<br>
direction or in other words in the longer direction between the liquid-permeable sheet<br>
and/or liquid-impermeable sheet and the absorbent composite. Another sheet-<br>
shaped substance may also be present between the absorbent composite and the<br>
liquid permeable sheet and/or liquid-impermeable sheet. In this case, the adhesive<br>
may be applied on the absorbent composite itself, or on another sheet, or on the<br>
liquid-permeable sheet and/or liquid impermeable sheet. In the present invention,<br>
the absorbent composite has a stable shape of a sheet, and is less likely to move or<br>
shift in the bodily fluid-absorbing article during use, thus it allows bodily fluid to be<br>
stably dispersed and absorbed. The applied adhesive serves as a barrier against<br>
the bodily fluid, thereby controls the flow of bodily fluid and allows it to disperse<br>
preferentially in the longer direction of the bodily fluid-absorbing article. Normally the<br>
bodily fluid-absorbing article has a longer direction and a shorter direction, and if the<br>
bodily fluid disperses preferentially in the longer direction, the usage efficiency of the<br>
70<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
absorbent composite is improved and bodily fluid is less likely to leak in the shorter<br>
direction.<br>
[0141] The properties of the adhesive used herein are not particularly limited, and it<br>
may be either liquid or solid. Adhesive may be used singly, or in combination of two<br>
or more. The type of adhesive is also not particularly limited, and examples include<br>
solvent type, water dispersion type, hot melt adhesives, reactant type and the like,<br>
specifically urea resin adhesives, melamine resin adhesives, phenol resin adhesives,<br>
resorcinol adhesives, alpha-olefin adhesiveness, water-soluble polymer-isocyanate<br>
adhesives, vinyl acetate resin emulsion adhesives, acrylic emulsion adhesives, vinyl<br>
acetate resin adhesives, chloroprene rubber adhesives, nitrile rubber adhesives,<br>
SBR adhesives, natural rubber adhesives, epoxy resin adhesives, cyanoacrylate<br>
adhesives, polyurethane adhesives, acrylic resin adhesives, anaerobic adhesives,<br>
denatured silicone adhesives, inorganic adhesives, paste and the like. Because<br>
hydrophilic adhesives disperse easily, and make it difficult to control the surface of<br>
the adhesive, a hydrophobic adhesive is preferably used. A hot melt adhesive is<br>
preferably used to facilitate the manufacturing process. A hot melt adhesive refers to<br>
any adhesive that is solid at room temperature and melts and spreads by heating<br>
and consolidates and adhere by cooling, and specific examples are those containing<br>
ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer resin, polyamide, polyester, atactic polypropylene,<br>
thermoplastic elastomers or the like as principal components, with rosin resin,<br>
petroleum resin or the like as tackifiers, as well as waxes, antioxidants, inorganic<br>
fillers, plasticizers and the like.<br>
[0142] The amount of adhesive may be any amount that provides adhesive effects.<br>
The amount of adhesive per unit length is preferably 0.000001 to 0.1 g/cm, more<br>
preferably 0.00001 to 0.01 g/cm or still more preferably 0.00003 to 0.0045 g/cm. The<br>
71<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
applied amount of adhesive per unit area of the absorbent composite is preferably<br>
0.2 to 1000 g/m2, more preferably 2.0 to 100 g/m2. If too much adhesive is applied<br>
on the absorbent composite, it will impede the water-absorbent resin from swelling<br>
and decrease the absorption capability, and impair the texture. On the other hand, it<br>
is not preferable to apply too little adhesive from the standpoint of adhesive strength.<br>
[0143] In the present invention the adhesive may be applied in a commonly used<br>
pattern such as wavy lines, dots, vertical stripes or the like. When the longer<br>
direction of the bodily-fluid absorbing article or the absorbent composite is defined as<br>
the lengthwise direction, and the shorter direction is defined as the crosswise<br>
direction, it is preferable that the adhesive is applied so as to cause liquid to flow<br>
preferentially in the lengthwise direction rather than the crosswise direction, in which<br>
leakage is most likely to occur, as it reduce leakage. Examples of shape and<br>
directionality in absorbent composites are shown in Figure 4 with the arrows showing<br>
the lengthwise direction, but they are not limited to these examples. It is desirable to<br>
apply the adhesive in a pattern that forms barriers extending in the lengthwise<br>
direction as a method of making liquid flow preferentially in the lengthwise direction.<br>
The flow of liquid is altered by the pattern of the adhesive, as the liquid can not flow<br>
over the adhesives, when the liquid disperses to reach to the adhesive. In the<br>
present invention, an adhesive pattern that preferentially directs this alteration of flow<br>
in the direction of length rather than the direction of width is a pattern of lines<br>
extending lengthwise with spaces between them. Desirable examples of such<br>
adhesive patterns are shown in Figure 13, but they are not limited to these examples.<br>
In Figure 13 A, the adhesive is applied linearly in the lengthwise direction. Each line<br>
may be a straight line or may be a curved line as in Figure 13 B. The lines may be<br>
continuous, or may be short lines as in Figures 13 C and D or patterns of dots as in<br>
72<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
Figures 13 E and F. Preferably at least 60%, more preferably at least 80% of each<br>
line is at angles of within 45° to the longer direction. 60% or 80% means the total<br>
percentage of the lengths of the straight lines that are at angles of within 45° to the<br>
longer direction relative to the total lengths of all the lines. Where the lines are<br>
curved, the overall vector of the lines is preferably at angle of within 45° to a straight<br>
line in the lengthwise direction. The lines are preferably spaced at intervals of 0.001<br>
to 10 cm, more preferably 0.01 to 5 cm or further more preferably 0.1 to 2 cm.<br>
Helical patterns which are arranged in the lengthwise direction as shown in Figure 13<br>
G is also preferable. The vector of a helical pattern is preferably at an angle of within<br>
45° to the longer direction. The vectors of each helical pattern are preferably spaced<br>
at intervals of 0.001 to 10 cm, more preferably 0.01 to 5 cm or further more preferably<br>
0.1 to 2 cm. A single pattern may be used, or multiple patterns may be combined as<br>
shown in Figure 13 H. A pattern of intersecting lines can also be used as in Figure<br>
13 1. In this case, preferably at least 60% or more preferably at least 80% of the total<br>
lines of adhesive are spaced at intervals of 0.001 to 10 cm.<br>

Evaluation of liquid return (rewetting), liquid dispersion distance<br>
A sufficiently wide wooden board is placed on a laboratory table, and the four<br>
corners of a bodily fluid-absorbing article are stretched but not getting wrinkled and<br>
fixed with thumb tacks. A cylindrical pipe with a diameter of 60 mm and a weight of<br>
53.5 g is placed on the center of the absorbent composite. 80 g of saline warmed to<br>
37°C is dripped through the pipe onto the center of the absorbent composite at a rate<br>
of 7 to 8 ml/second. After the saline is no longer visible on the upper surface of the<br>
top sheet, the pipe is removed. 5 minutes after the start of dripping, the distance of<br>
73<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
dispersion in the lengthwise direction is measured and determined to be the liquid<br>
dispersion distance.<br>
[0145] 1 minute after the dripping started, a 10 cm square piece that is cut out from<br>
Advantec No. 2 filter paper with a diameter of 150 mm are stacked on the dripping<br>
position so that the total weight become about 90 g, and a 3.5 kg load is immediately<br>
applied on the filter papers. 3 minutes after the load was applied, the load is<br>
removed, the filter papers are taken out from the article and weighed. The amount of<br>
the weight of the filter papers increased from the original weight is determined to be<br>
the first rewet amount.<br>
9 minutes after the dripping started, the cylinder is replaced. 10 minutes after<br>
the dripping started, 80 g more of saline is dripped and the same procedures as the<br>
first dripping are repeated. The amount of the weight of the filter papers increased<br>
after these procedures is then determined to be the second rewet amount.<br>
19 minutes after the first dripping started, the pipe is replaced, and 20 minutes<br>
after the first dripping started, 80 g more of saline is dripped and the same<br>
procedures are repeated. The amount of the weight of the filter papers increased<br>
after these procedures is then determined to be the third rewet amount.<br>
[0146] The rewet amount is an indicator of rewetting or in other words of the feeling<br>
of the bodily fluid-absorbing article during use. If the rewet amount is large, the skin<br>
will become wet and the article will be unpleasant to wear. The rewet amount is<br>
preferably as small as possible to keep the surface of the article dry and make it<br>
comfortable to wear. The repeated rewet amounts indicate the feeling of the bodily<br>
fluid-absorbing article when it is worn continuously and absorbs bodily fluid<br>
repeatedly. The larger the second and third rewet amounts, the more comfortable the<br>
article will be when it is used continuously. The first rewet amount is preferably not<br>
74<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
more than 30 g, more preferably not more than 20 g, further more preferably not<br>
more than 10 g or still more preferably not more than 3 g. The second rewet amount<br>
is preferably not more than 40 g, more preferably not more than 30 g, further more<br>
preferably not more than 25 g or still more preferably not more than 20 g. The third<br>
rewet amount is preferably not more than 50 g, more preferably not more than 45 g,<br>
further more preferably not more than 40 g or still more preferably not more than 30 g.<br>
[0147] The liquid dispersion distance means the distance of the portion that was used<br>
to absorb the liquid in the absorbent composite, and the longer the liquid dispersion<br>
distance, the higher the usage efficiency of the absorbent composite. If the usage<br>
efficiency of the absorbent composite is high, the necessary absorption capability can<br>
be attained with a small quantity of absorbent composite, allowing for conservation of<br>
resources. If the liquid dispersion distance is long, the absorbent layer after liquid<br>
absorption become thin, the likelihood of displacement of the absorbent composite<br>
decrease, and the absorbent composite become more comfortable to wear. The<br>
liquid dispersion distance is preferably at least 200 mm, more preferably at least 240<br>
mm, further more preferably at least 270 mm or still more preferably at least 300 mm.<br>
[0148].Evaluation of lengthwise dispersion, distribution area<br>
A sufficiently wide wooden board is placed on a laboratory table, and the four<br>
corners of a bodily fluid-absorbing article are stretched but not getting wrinkled and<br>
fixed with thumb tacks. 50 cc of saline is continuously dripped at a rate of 1<br>
ml/second onto the center of the absorbent composite. 2 minutes after completion of<br>
dripping, the length and width of the part into which the liquid dispersed are<br>
measured. Lengthwise dispersion is calculated according to Formula 11, and<br>
distribution area according to Formula 12.<br>
(Formula 11)<br>
75<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
Lengthwise dispersion = length of dispersion in the lengthwise direction<br>
(cm)/length of dispersion in the crosswise direction (cm)<br>
(Formula 12)<br>
Distribution area = length of dispersion in the lengthwise direction (cm) x<br>
length of dispersion in the crosswise direction (cm)<br>
[0149] In a bodily fluid-absorbing article, leakage is normally more likely in the<br>
crosswise direction, in which the article generally is shorter. It is preferable that the<br>
lengthwise dispersion is high, as it makes liquid flow more readily in the lengthwise<br>
direction, and reduces leakage. A higher lengthwise dispersion is also desirable<br>
because it increases the usage efficiency of the absorbent composite. The<br>
lengthwise dispersion is preferably at least 1.4, more preferably at least 1.7, further<br>
more preferably at least 2.0 or still more preferably at least 2.5. In an absorbent<br>
composite with good dispersibility, the liquid may disperse as far as it reaches to the<br>
lateral edge. Leakage usually does not occur immediately after the liquid reaches to<br>
the edge, or is prevented by gathers or the like. However, it is preferable that the<br>
length of dispersion in the crosswise direction is shorter than the width of the article,<br>
as leakage may occur if a large quantity of liquid is further added.<br>
[0150] The distribution area is an indicator of the liquid dispersibility of the article, and<br>
it is preferable to use the absorbent composite with higher distribution area in order<br>
to increase the usage efficiency of the absorbent composite. If the amount of liquid<br>
to be absorbed is kept constant, the absorbent composite with higher distribution<br>
area changes less in thickness after absorption and is more stable, because the<br>
amount of liquid to be absorbed per unit area decrease as the distribution area<br>
increase. If the absorbent composite change little in thickness, moreover, the article<br>
is more comfortable to wear without a feeling of pressure to the user. The<br>
76<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
distribution area is preferably at least 150 cm2, more preferably at least 200 cm2,<br>
further more preferably at least 250 cm2 or still more preferably at least 300 cm2.<br>
[0151]•Evaluating leakage<br>
In the present invention, leakage is measured as follows. The center of the<br>
absorbent composite part in the bodily fluid-absorbing article is marked with a cross<br>
mark with a size of about 1 cm. The absorbent composite is fixed with thumb tacks<br>
to a horizontal board over a line drawn parallel to the short direction from the center<br>
as shown in Figure 14. When the absorbent composite has gathers or the like, the<br>
gathers are also fixed so that the edges of the absorbent composite can be seen<br>
from above. A plastic board is then inserted as shown in Figure 15, and an article is<br>
fixed with tape so that they form an angle of 30° at the fixed point. In this case the<br>
absorbent composite is stretched but not getting wrinkled.<br>
[0152] Saline dyed with edible red is dripped at a rate of 0.1 ml/second onto the point<br>
marked with a cross mark. The amount of liquid dripped at the point when the<br>
dispersed liquid begins to disperse outside of the edge of the absorbent composite is<br>
determined to be the leakage drip amount.<br>
[0153] The leakage drip amount is preferably at least 100 ml, more preferably at least<br>
120 ml, further more preferably at least 135 ml or still more preferably at least 150 ml.<br>
The leakage drip amount can be increased by increasing the thickness and weight of<br>
the absorbent composite, but the article itself is preferably thin and lightweight. In the<br>
present invention, therefore, the leakage coefficient as an indicator of leakage<br>
resistance per unit area is determined according to (Formula 13) below based on the<br>
leakage drip amount, the weight of the absorbent composite and the area of the<br>
absorbent composite.<br>
(Formula 13)<br>
77<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
Leakage coefficient = leakage drip amount (ml)/(the weight of the absorbent<br>
composite (g)/the area of the absorbent composite (cm2))<br>
The weight and area of the absorbent composite are determined by measuring<br>
the absorbent composite as a whole. In absorbent composites with the same weight<br>
and area, the greater the leakage coefficient, the greater the resistance to leakage.<br>
The leakage coefficient is preferably at least 1000, more preferably at least 2000,<br>
further more preferably at least 3000 or still more preferably at least 4000. It is<br>
preferable that the absorbent composite has both the leakage coefficient within this<br>
range and the leakage drip amount within the range described above.<br>

400 rpm for 2 hours to give an emulsion containing a wet gel. The inside of the<br>
reaction system was returned to normal pressure with nitrogen, sealed, and heated<br>
at an internal temperature of 80°C, the stirring speed was set to 400 rpm, and a<br>
mixed solution of 108.8 g of ethanol from Wako Pure Chemical and 4.2 g of glycerin<br>
was added over 15 minutes. The system was pressurized with nitrogen, heated to<br>
an internal temperature of 110°C and maintained with stirring for 30 minutes. The<br>
pressure was then lowered to normal pressure, and the resulting wet gel was washed<br>
three times with 2 L of cyclohexane at 40°C.<br>
The resulting wet gel was collected by filtration, dried in a 70°C full vacuum<br>
and collected. After completion of drying, it was grounded with a homogenizer and<br>
classified by sieving into sizes of under 106 µm, 106 to 212 µm, 212 to 300 µm, 300<br>

Acrylic acid of reagent special grade from Wako Pure Chemical was purified<br>
by distillation. 753 g of the purified acrylic acid was cooled in an ice bath and<br>
maintained at a liquid temperature of 30°C or less, and 625 g of 25 wt% aqueous<br>
ammonia solution of reagent special grade from Wako Pure Chemical was added<br>
gradually with stirring to give a 66 wt% ammonium acrylate aqueous solution<br>
(neutralization rate 100%). This was then deoxygenated by bubbling with nitrogen<br>
gas.<br>
4.3 L of cyclohexane and 7.53 g of sorbitan monolaurate as a surfactant were<br>
added to a 12 L autoclave substituted with a nitrogen atmosphere in advance, and<br>
dissolved by stirring at room temperature, and the reaction system was<br>
deoxygenated under reduced pressure of 30 kPa. This was heated, still under<br>
reduced pressure, to an internal temperature of 40°C. An aqueous solution of 0.7699<br>
g of ammonium persulfate dissolved in 50 g of water was added to the<br>
aforementioned ammonium acrylate aqueous solution. After the internal temperature<br>
of the reaction system had reached 40°C, the prepared ammonium acrylate aqueous<br>

surface was 91% and the salt concentration at the center was 98%.<br>
The water-absorbent resin particles 10 manufactured in Manufacturing 10<br>
were heat treated for 10 minutes in an inert oven at 180°C. The conditions for this<br>
operation are the same as the heat treatment conditions for forming a composite with<br>
the base material in the following examples. As a result, the surface salt strength of<br>
the water-absorbent resin was 2.8 N, with an overall ammonium salt concentration of<br>
70%, the salt concentration of the surface of 29% and the salt concentration at the<br>
center of 95%.<br>

A portion of a circle with a diameter of 59.5 mm was cut out from Bemliese®<br>
from Asahi Kasei Fibers Corp. (material properties shown in Table 2) , and the<br>
weight of the portion was 0.0796 g. Bemliese® is a nonwoven fabric made from<br>
100% cellulose continuous-filament. Because it is a cellulose nonwoven fabric, it has<br>
89<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
excellent absorption properties. Because it is made from the continuous filaments, it<br>
is sufficiently strong when containing water and has excellent liquid dispersibility.<br>
Of the water-absorbent resin particles 1 synthesized in Manufacturing 1, 0.164<br>
g of particles with a particle size of 850 to 1200 urn were arranged on Teflon sheet<br>
with a diameter of 59.5mm so that the particles were not closely packed. This was<br>
called Teflon (1). Another Teflon sheet was prepared in the same way and called<br>
Teflon (2). The Bemliese® was placed on Teflon (1), and sprayed with 3 ml of water<br>
with an atomizer. Teflon (1) was placed upside-down on Teflon (2) with the<br>
Bemliese® side of Teflon (1) on top of the particle side of Teflon (2). This was<br>
pressed down lightly by hand, left for 1 minute, and heated for 10 minutes at 180°C in<br>
an inert oven. The weight as measured immediately after heating was 0.4061 g.<br>
The weight ratio of the water-absorbent resin in the composite is calculated as 80.4%.<br>
All of the water-absorbent resin particles were strongly adhered to Bemliese®, and<br>
none of the water-absorbent resin became detached when rubbed by hand. It was<br>
observed with a scanning electron microscope (JEOL JSM-5300) that all the particles<br>
adhere to Bemliese® with fibers incorporated inside the water-absorbent resin.<br>
Figure 16 is an electron microscope image of the configuration of adhesion (150x<br>
enlargement), which was taken from the side at an angle, rather than from above the<br>
particles, so that the adhesion configuration appears in the image. This composite<br>
was called Example 1.<br>
In Figure 16, the part inside the circle is an adhering bond between the water-<br>
absorbent resin and fibers. The water-absorbent resin particles appear to the upper<br>
right of the black part and the fiber part of the base material to the lower left, and the<br>
fibers appear black, showing that they are bonded inside the water-absorbent resin<br>
particles.<br>

[0169] (Comparative Example 1)<br>
81.73 g of reagent acrylic acid (Wako Pure Chemical, reagent special grade),<br>
185.71 g of water and 31.78 g of sodium hydroxide were gradually added in a 300 ml<br>
flask with ice cooling so that the liquid temperature did not exceed 30°C (salt<br>
concentration 70%). 90 g of this monomer solution was poured into an atomizer in a<br>

A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
nitrogen box, and 0.0561 g of N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide was added. The<br>
aqueous solution was deoxygenated by bubbling with nitrogen gas. 1 ml of a<br>
solution of 0.022 g of iron chloride (III) hexahydrate dissolved in 100 g of water, 1 ml<br>
of 30 wt% hydrogen peroxide solution, and a solution of 0.12 g of L-ascorbic acid<br>
dissolved in 1ml of water were rapidly added and stirred, and the mixture was<br>
sprayed over Spun Bond EltasCrimp® PC8020 from Asahi Kasei Fibers Corp..<br>
Whole set of this including nonwoven fabric was heated to 60°C with a hot plate, and<br>
polymerized for 1 hour, then the temperature was raised to 120°C and maintained for<br>
30 minutes to complete polymerization. It was vacuum dried at 100°C, the residual<br>
monomer level was measured as 1000 ppm or more.<br>
[0170] (Comparative Example 2)<br>
A composite was prepared in the same way as Example 1 using the water-<br>
absorbent resin particles 2 prepared in Manufacturing 2. Particles with a particle size<br>
of 850 to 1200 urn were used. Because the ammonium salt concentration near the<br>
surface was as low as 30%, only about 35% of the resin particles adhered. The area<br>
occupancy rate was measured immediately after heating before the resin had<br>
detached. Because the ratio of the particles adhering is low, it was difficult to obtain<br>
stable performance. The evaluation results are shown in Table 3.<br>

The particles with a particle size of 850 to 1200 µm were used. Because the strength<br>
was low when it was wet, it readily tore while being handled.<br>
(Example 27-2)<br>
A composite of Example 27-2 was prepared in the same way as Example 1<br>
except that the ratio of resin was 94%, the water-absorbent resin particles 1 with a<br>
particle size of 850 to 1200 urn manufactured in Manufacturing 1 were used. 95% of<br>
the water-absorbent resin particles adhered. The absorbent resin particles were<br>
densely packed. Some particles detached after absorption, because some of the<br>
particles overlapped with each other.<br>
[0181] (Reference Example 1)<br>
The liquid permeability of "Saran Wrap" from Asahi Kasei Life &amp; Living Co., Ltd.<br>
was measured. The water could not pass through the wrap. It is not preferable to<br>

use a completely water-impermeable film for sanitary material, because it can be<br>
used only for one side.<br>
[0182] (Comparative Example 7)<br>
A mixture of pulp and water-absorbent resin was taken out from absorber of a<br>
Pampers Cotton Care® M size from P &amp; G Co., Ltd., and used as Comparative<br>
Example 7. The water-absorbent resin did not adhere to the pulp, and the pulp was<br>
cottony and did not maintain its shape. The weight ratio of the resin could not be<br>
measured by the method of the present invention. Because there was no base<br>
material, the area occupancy rate could not be measured.<br>
(Comparative Example 8)<br>
A top sheet and back sheet were separated from a Rifure Anshin Pad®, 150 cc<br>
size from Livedo Corporation, and the absorber alone was taken out. A circular piece<br>
of with a diameter of 59.5 mm was cut out from the center of this. The water-<br>
absorbent resin adhered to the base material with an adhesive and they did not<br>
directly adhere to the base material. This was given as Comparative Example 8.<br>
[0183] (Comparative Example 9)<br>
Acrylic acid of special grade reagent from Wako Pure Chemical was used after<br>
being purified by distillation. 10 g of the reagent acrylic acid was dissolved in 91.02 g<br>
of water. This aqueous solution was chilled in an ice bath and maintained at a liquid<br>
temperature of 30°C or less and 117.94 g of 25 wt% aqueous ammonia solution was<br>
added gradually with stirring to give a 40 wt% ammonium acrylate aqueous solution.<br>
A simple nitrogen box was prepared, and all subsequent operations were<br>
carried out in a nitrogen-substituted nitrogen box. 90 g of the 40 wt% ammonium<br>
acrylate aqueous solution and 0.0187 g of N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide were added<br>
in a 300 ml flask. The aqueous solution was deoxygenated by bubbling with nitrogen<br>

A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
gas. The internal temperature at this time was 20°C. 0.43 g of 42 wt% glycerin<br>
aqueous solution was then added with a syringe and thoroughly stirred, and 0.0917 g<br>
of 30 wt% hydrogen peroxide aqueous solution and 0.0415 g of Rongalite, each<br>
dissolved in 1 g of water, were added to initiate polymerization. After the internal<br>
temperature began to rise from 20°C, 50 g of the reaction liquid was poured over 3 g<br>
of Bemliese® prepared in a tray. This was left for 3 hours, taken out from the<br>
nitrogen box, and then dried for 4 hours at 100°C in an inert oven. This was given as<br>
Comparative Example 9. This absorbent composite was hard and difficult to cut or<br>
bend. Because it was difficult to measure the absorption capacity of the absorbent<br>
composite directly, it was first pulverized in the same way as water-absorbent resin<br>
particles and sieve-classified to a size of 106 to 850 urn before being measured. The<br>
weight ratio of the resin and area occupancy rate could not be measured for this<br>
composite, as it had been pulverized into particles.<br>
[0184] (Comparative Example 10)<br>
A composite was prepared in the same way as Example 1 except that the<br>
water-absorbent resin particles 1 with a particle size of 850 to 1200 µm manufactured<br>
in Manufacturing 1 were used, and the weight ratio of the resin was 25%. This was<br>
given as Comparative Example 10. All the water-absorbent resin particles adhered.<br>

A composite was prepared in the same way as Example 1 except that the<br>
water-absorbent resin particles 1 with a particle size of 850 to 1200 µm manufactured<br>

[0186] (Manufacturing 12)<br>
Water-absorbent resin particles 12 were manufactured in the same way as<br>
Manufacturing 1 except that the particles were classified by sieving using sieves with<br>
a sieve opening of 106 µm, 212 µm, 300 µm, 425 µm, 500 µm, 600 µm, 710 µm, 850<br>

Water-absorbent resin particles 13 were manufactured in the same way as in<br>
Manufacturing 3 except that the particles were classified by sieving using sieves with<br>
a sieve opening of 106 µm, 212 µm, 300 µm, 425 µm, 500 µm, 600 µm, 710 µm, 850<br>

[0187] (Example 28)<br>
A piece with a length of 27 cm and a width of 8 cm was cut out from Bemliese®<br>
from Asahi Kasei Fiber. Bemliese® is a nonwoven fabric made of 100% cellulose<br>
continuous-filament. As it is a cellulose nonwoven fabric, it has excellent absorption<br>
properties. Because it is made of continuous filaments, it is sufficiently strong when<br>
containing water and has excellent liquid dispersibility. A piece with a length of 27<br>
cm and a width of 8 cm was cut out from Teflon® sheet, and a line with a length of 25<br>
cm and a width of 6 cm was drawn on it. Another of the same was prepared. 1.5 g<br>
of the water-absorbent resin particles 12 that remained on the 1000 µm sieve from<br>
Manufacturing 12 were scattered uniformly on the inside of the line on the sheet<br>
using a 1180 µm sieve. 1.5 g of the resin particles that remained on the 212 µm<br>
sieve were scattered uniformly in the same way using a 300 µm sieve. 1.5 g of the<br>
resin particles that remained on the 1000 µm sheet were scattered in the same way<br>
on another sheet. 1.2 g of water was sprayed with an atomizer onto the Bemliese®,<br>
then it was placed on the prepared sheets to adhere the resin to both surfaces. It was<br>
105<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
dried for 10 minutes at 180°C in an inert oven with the portion with no resin being<br>
pressed with weights to prevent shrinkage of the Bemliese®. This was given as<br>
Example 28.<br>

[0189] (Example 33)<br>
A composite of Example 33 was prepared in the same way as Example 28<br>
except that the water-absorbent resin particles 13 of Manufacturing 13 were used.<br>
The absorption amount of the composite was slightly less, as the resin particles were<br>
not in the form of ammonium salts and absorbed less compared with the water-<br>
absorbent resin of Manufacturing 12. Some particles detached after manufacturing,<br>
as the salt concentration of the surface was slightly less than that of ammonium salts.<br>

A composite of Example 35 was manufactured in the same way as Example<br>
28 except that Oji Kinocloth KS-40® from Oji Kinocloth was used instead of<br>

[0194] (Example 40)<br>
The apparatus shown in Figure 17 was prepared, (a) is a fabric roll (base<br>
material) of Bemliese® from Asahi Kasei Fiber with a width of 500 mm. The<br>
measured density of this fabric was 28 g/m2. Gas line and water line were attached<br>
to the spray nozzle of water atomizer (b). The sprayed amount of water was<br>
adjusted by adjusting the gas pressure and the water pressure in the spray nozzle. A<br>
water-absorbent resin particle hopper (d1) (supply part) was provided. Gas blower<br>
(i1) was provided on the top of drum (e1) to blow off water-absorbent resin particles<br>
from hopper (d1) that adhered to other parts than the dimples on the drum. Dry<br>
warm air blower (j1) was provided to dry the surface of the drum before it came into<br>
contact with the particles. Drum (e1) had a diameter of 500 mm and a width of 500<br>
mm. The structure of the dimples on the drum surface is shown in Figures 18 and 19.<br>
Figure 18 shows the positional relationship of the dimples as seen from above the<br>
drum surface. The dimples were arranged such that the distance between the<br>
centers of adjacent dimples was about 3.1 mm. Figure 19 is a cross-section view of<br>
a dimple in the depth direction, showing a hole structure extending from the surface<br>
of the drum to the inside of the drum, wherein the opening on the drum surface is a<br>
circle with a diameter of 1.5 mm and narrows towards the inside of the drum to a<br>
diameter of 0.7 mm at a depth of 0.8 mm, and then maintains a diameter of 0.7 mm<br>
to the inside of the drum.<br>
[0195] Fabric (c), which passed under drum (e1) and to one surface of which the<br>
resin particles (f) adhere, then passes between press rolls (I), which strengthens the<br>
adhesion between the resin particles and the fabric. The same equipment mentioned<br>
above was used for drum (e2), upper hopper (d2), gas blower (i2) and dry warm air<br>
blower 02) as for drum (e1), hopper (d1), gas blower (i1) and dry warm air blower (j1),<br>
110<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
respectively. The fabric was conveyed by conveyer belt (k) from beneath drum (e2)<br>
to the exit of dryer (g). In dryer (g), a distance that the fabric travels is about 2 m,<br>
and warm air was blown from the fabric exit towards the fabric entrance. Final take-<br>
up roll (h) was operated by hand in order to control the rotational speed so as to<br>
maintain a roughly constant deflection of the fabric between the belt conveyer and<br>
the final roll.<br>
[0196] Figure 20 shows a structure including internal structure of drum (e1).<br>
The interior of drum (e1) is divided by partition (o1) into reduced pressure<br>
space (q1) and normal pressure space. Gas blower (ml) is fixed to the position<br>
where the drum contacts the fabric, and emits gas to blow out particles in holes that<br>
pass the gas blower (ml). Drum (e1) also has another gas blower (n1), which emits<br>
gas to blow out particles that were not blown onto the fabric into residual resin<br>
container (p1).<br>
[0197] Figure 21 shows a structure including internal structure of drum (e2).<br>
The interior of drum (e2) is divided by partition (o2) into reduced pressure<br>
space (q2) and normal pressure space. Gas blower (m2) is fixed to the position<br>
where the drum contacts the fabric, and emits gas to blow out particles in holes that<br>
pass the of gas blower (m2). Drum (e2) also has another gas blower (n2), which<br>
emits gas to blow out residual resin that were not blown onto the fabric onto the<br>
fabric once again.<br>
The water-absorbent resin particles used here were 850 to 1200 urn sized<br>
particles manufactured by the method given in Manufacturing 1. 1 kg of these resin<br>
particles was placed in each hopper (d1) and hopper (d2). Every time the amount of<br>
resin in each hopper decreased to about 300 g during operation, resin was added to.<br>
the hopper up to 1 kg of resin. This operation was repeated to prevent the resin in<br>
111<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
the hoppers from being exhausted during operation. Reduced pressure spaces (q1)<br>
and (q2) were depressurized from near the axis so as to maintain the pressure of<br>
about 700-750 mmHg. Air was blown from gas blowers (i1) and (i2), and the volume<br>
of blown air was adjusted so as to bring most of the resin adhere to other parts than<br>
the dimples back to the hoppers. Warm dry air was blown from dry warm air blowers<br>
(j1) and (j2) to dry the surfaces of the drums. Gas was blown from gas blowers (ml),<br>
(m2), (n1) and (n2). Nitrogen gas at 180°C was supplied through dryer (g) from the<br>
exit towards the entrance at a rate of 50 m3/hr. The amount of water sprayed by the<br>
water sprayer was adjusted so that the water content of the Bemliese would be 20g<br>
water/m2 when the rate of movement of the Bemliese was 0.2 m/minute.<br>
Drums (e1) and (e2) and conveyer belt (k) were rotated so as to ensure the<br>
fabric move smoothly, and operation was initiated after adjusting the speed of the<br>
fabric to about 0.3 m/minute.<br>
During operation, composite roll (h) was operated by hand so as to maintain a<br>
roughly constant deflection between conveyer belt (k) and composite roll (h).<br>
The fabric coming out from the roll 20 to 60 minutes after the initiation of<br>
operation was evaluated in various ways.<br>
[0198] (Evaluation of manufactured absorbent composite: adhesion between resin<br>
and fabric)<br>
A 10cm square piece was cut out from the absorbent composite manufactured<br>
in Example 40 and the mode of adhesion between the fibers in the nonwoven fabric<br>
and the absorbent resin was observed with an optical microscope. The fibers passed<br>
through the resin.<br>
[0199] (Evaluation of manufactured absorbent composite: the weight ratio of resin of<br>
absorbent composite)<br>
112<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
Part of the absorbent composite manufactured in Example 40 was divided into<br>
pieces with a length of 50 cm and 10 pieces of these were selected to measure the<br>
ratio of the resin. The ratio of the resin was between 82 and 86 wt%. That is, there<br>
was little variation in the weight ratio of the resin in the manufactured absorbent<br>
composite. This absorbent composite was divided into pieces with a length of 50 cm<br>
and 10 pieces of these were selected at random to measure the ratio of the resin<br>
content. The ratio of the resin varied greatly between 70 wt% and 90 wt%, showing<br>
that the fabric did not have a stable weight ratio of resin. The weight ratio of the resin<br>
in the absorbent composite was calculated by the same methods used in Example 42<br>
below.<br>
[0200] (Evaluation of manufactured absorbent composite: adhesion between<br>
absorbent resin and fabric)<br>
A piece with a length of 50 cm was cut out from the absorbent composite<br>
manufactured in Example 40 and was hanged on a bar fixed at about 1m in height,<br>
and the bar was shaken up and down for 60 seconds at a rate of 15 cm/second with<br>
a shaking width of 30 cm. The weight ratio of the resin of the absorbent composite<br>
was 84 wt%, and only 5 resin particles fell off.<br>
[0201] (Evaluation of manufactured absorbent composite: absorption amount under<br>
no pressure)<br>
The amount absorbed under no pressure by the absorbent composite<br>
manufactured in Example 40 was 61 g/g. The absorption capacity per unit area was<br>
1 g/cm2.<br>
[0202] (Example 41)<br>
The operation was carried out in the same way as Example 40 except that the<br>
water-absorbent resin particles of Manufacturing 3 were used.<br>
113<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
(Evaluation of manufactured absorbent composite: area occupancy rate of absorbent<br>
composite)<br>
The area occupancy rate per one surface of the absorbent composite<br>
manufactured in Example 41 was 15.5%.<br>
[0203] (Evaluation of manufactured absorbent composite: adhesion between water-<br>
absorbent resin and fabric)<br>
A piece with a length of 50 cm was cut out from the absorbent composite<br>
manufactured in Example 41 and was hanged on a bar fixed at about 1 m high, and<br>
the bar was shaken for 60 seconds up and down at 15 cm/second with a shaking<br>
range of 30 cm. The weight ratio of the resin of the absorbent composite was 85 wt%,<br>
and only 20 particles of resin fell off.<br>
(Example 42)(The water content of the base material is less than 0.5 wt%)<br>
The operation was carried out in the same way as Example 40 except that the<br>
amount of water sprayed by the atomizer was reduced so as to adjust the water<br>
content of the Bemliese after having passed under the water atomizer to 0.3 wt%.<br>
The fabric coming out from the machine 20 to 60 minutes after the initiation of<br>
operation was used. A piece with a length of 50 cm was cut out from this absorbent<br>
composite and was hanged on a bar fixed at about 1 m high, and the bar was<br>
shaken 60 times at 30 cm/second with a shaking range of 30 cm. The weight ratio of<br>
resin of the absorbent composite was 30 wt% or less. Few resin particles adhered to<br>
the fabric that had a low water content. The amount of resin of the absorbent<br>
composite is determined by subtracting the weight of the fabric in the absorbent<br>
composite from the total weight of the absorbent composite. The weight of the fabric<br>
in the absorbent composite was determined by multiplying 0.25 m2 by the density of<br>
the fabric in the dry state before use (g/m2) which was measured in advance with the<br>
114<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
assumption that area of the piece with a length of 50 cm which was cut out for this<br>
measurement is 0.25 m2. The weight ratio of the resin in the absorbent composite is<br>
given as a percentage and is obtained by dividing the weight of resin in the absorbent<br>
composite as calculated by the aforementioned method by the total weight of the<br>
absorbent composite.<br>
[0204] (Example 43) (The water-absorbent resin particles containing more than<br>
50 wt% water were used)<br>
1 kg of the water-absorbent resin particles were placed in a 10 L Teflon<br>
container, and 2 kg of water was added all at once with stirring vigorously. After<br>
almost all of the water had been absorbed by the water-absorbent resin particles, it<br>
was stop to be stirred. The operation was carried out in the same way as Example 40<br>
except that these were used as the water-absorbent resin particles. The fabric<br>
coming out from the machine 20 to 60 minutes after the initiation of operation was<br>
used. This absorbent composite was divided into pieces with a length of 50 cm and<br>
10 of these pieces were taken at random and the weight ratios of the resin were<br>
measured. They varied greatly between 70 wt% and 90 wt%, showing that the<br>
weight ratio of the resin was not steady. The weight ratio of the resin of the<br>
absorbent composite was calculated by the same methods as in Example 42.<br>
[0205] (Example 44) (The outer diameter of the dimples on the drum surface<br>
of coating machine was larger than 3 times the average particle size of the water-<br>
absorbent resin)<br>
The operation was carried out in the same way as Example 40 except that<br>
drums having surface dimples with an outer diameter of 4 mm were used as drums<br>
(e1) and (e2). The fabric coming out from the machine 20 to 60 minutes after the<br>
initiation of operation was used. This absorbent composite was divided into pieces<br>
115<br><br>
A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
with a length of 50 cm and 10 of these pieces were taken at random and the weight<br>
ratios of the resin were measured. They varied greatly between 92 wt% and 75 wt%,<br>
showing that the weight ratio of the resin was not steady. The weight ratio of the<br>
resin of the absorbent composite was calculated by the same methods as in Example<br>
42.<br>
[0206] (Example 45)	(The depth of the dimples on the drum surface of coating<br>
machine was larger than 2 times the average particle size of the water-absorbent<br>
resin)<br>
The operation was carried out in the same way as Example 40 except that<br>
drums having surface dimples with a depth of 4 mm rather than 0.8 mm were used as<br>
drums (e1) and (e2). The fabric coming out from the machine 20 to 60 minutes after<br>
the initiation of operation was used. This absorbent composite was divided into<br>
pieces with a length of 50 cm and 10 of these pieces were taken at random and the<br>
weight ratios of the resin were measured, they varied greatly between 92 wt% and 75<br>
wt%, showing that the weight ratio of the resin was not steady. The weight ratio of<br>
the resin of the absorbent composite was calculated by the same methods as in<br>
Example 42.<br>
[0207] (Example 46)	(PET nonwoven fabric was used)<br>
The coating machine was operated in the same way as Example 40 except<br>
that PET nonwoven fabric was used as the fabric. The fabric coming out from the<br>
machine 20 to 60 minutes after the initiation of operation was used. A piece with a<br>
length of 50 cm was cut out from this absorbent composite and hanged on a bar at<br>
about 1 m high and the bar was shaken up and down for 60 seconds at a rate of 15<br>
cm/second with a shaking range of 30 cm. The weight ratio of the resin of the<br>
absorbent composite was 30 wt% or less, and few resin particles adhered to the PET<br>

A0501 VP32W/YA<br>
nonwoven fabric. The weight ratio of the resin of the absorbent composite was<br>
calculated as in Example 42.<br>
[0208] (Example 47)	( PP nonwoven fabric was used)<br>
The coating machine was operated in the same way as Example 40 except<br>
that PP nonwoven fabric was used as the fabric. The fabric coming out from the<br>
machine 20 to 60 minutes after the initiation of operation was used. A piece with a<br>
length of 50 cm length was cut out from this absorbent composite and hanged on a<br>
bar fixed at about 1 m high and the bar was shaken 60 times at a rate of 30<br>
cm/second with a shaking range of 30 cm. The weight ratio of the resin of the<br>
absorbent composite was 30 wt% or less, and few resin particles adhered to the PP<br>
nonwoven fabric. The weight ratio of the resin of the absorbent composite was<br>
calculated as in Example 42.<br>
[0209] (Example 48)<br>
A piece with a length of 37 cm and with a width of 21cm was cut out from<br>
Bennl'iese®. A piece with a length of 37 cm and with a width of 21cm was cut out from<br>
Teflon® in the same way, and a line with a length of 35 cm and a width of 19 cm was<br>
drawn on it. Another of the same was prepared. 6.6 g of the particles with a particle<br>
size of 1000 to 1180 µm of Manufacturing 1 were used as the large particles and<br>
scattered uniformly on the inside of the line on the sheet using a 1180 µm sieve.<br>
