Clamping device for mounting on a profile member<br>
The present invention relates to a clamping device for mounting on a profile member.<br>
More particularly, the invention relates to such a device of the kind comprising two clamping jaws which are intended to be placed in front of each other at mutually opposite sides of the profile member and each of which comprises an inner portion and two end portions f   projecting in mutually opposite directions from the inner portion and formed integrally with the inner portion, said end portions being provided with through holes for clamping bolts by means of which the two clamping jaws can be brought to bear under pressure against the profile member with contact surfaces thereof, formed by the inner portions of the clamping jaws.<br>
A disadvantage of known clamping devices of said kind is that they are suited to be mounted only on profile members having dimensions and shapes varying within fairly narrow limits. Therefore, in order to satisfy the need for clamping devices for different types of profile members having strongly varying dimensions and shapes, one has previously been forced to offer for sale a large number of different clamping devices comprising clamping jaws of different shape and size.<br>
The invention has for its purpose to provide an improved clamping device of the kind initially specified being of such a nature as to permit it to be mounted on profile members of many different kinds, exhibiting a large variation in respect of their dimensions and shapes.<br>
The clamping device, according to the invention proposed for said purpose, is primarily characterized in that the inner portion of at least one  of the two clamping jaws is provided with profiled contact sure-<br><br>
faces of mutually different shapes at mutually opposite sides of said portion.<br>
By designing at least one of the two clamping jaws of the clamping device in the above manner, one can make it possible to adapt the device to different profile members having strongly varying dimensions and shapes, since said clamping jaw can be turned at choice with one or the other of its two sides against the profile member in question.<br>
At one side thereof, the inner portion of said at least one clamping jaw may suitably have the general shape of a projection protruding from the clamping jaw, while, at its other side, it may have the general shape of a recess provided in the clamping jaw,<br>
Said recess may preferably have an at least approximately V-shaped profile, while, at least along the major portion of its length, said projection may have a height decreasing in a direction from its middle and towards each end portion of the clamping jaw. Moreover, at its middle, said projection may have a recess provided therein which similarly to the recess previously mentioned preferably may have a generally V-shaped profile.<br>
The clamping jaw according to the invention may be utilized to support one or more outer elements that may be affixed thereto. In order, in this case, to permit both clamping jaws to be provided with a profiled contact surface at each of the two mutually opposite sides thereof so that each clamping jaw may be turned at choice with one or the other side thereof against the profile member, said outer elements may be affixed to the clamping device for instance with the aid of supporting means that may be affixed to at least one of the two clamping bolts of the device.<br>
However, according to a preferred embodiment of<br><br>
the invention, the clamping device may instead comprise only one clamping jaw which is provided with a profiled contact surface at each of its two opposite sides and the other clamping jaw may be provided with a profiled contact surface only at one side thereof, while, at its other side, it may be provided with protruding means for supporting one or more outer elements that may be affixed to the clamping device,<br>
Although, in this case, only one clamping jaw may be turned at choice with one or the other of its two sides against the profile member, the clamping device may still be mounted on many different profile members having dimensions and shapes varying within wide limits.<br>
At its said one side, the inner portion of said other clamping jaw may then preferably have the general shape of a recess provided in said clamping jaw and suitably having an at least approximately V-shaped pro-file with a preferred angle width of  <br>
In order to make it possible to produce the clamping device at very low costs, the clamping jaws may advantageously consist of cut pieces of extruded aluminium profiles.<br>
Below the invention is further described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:-<br>
Figure 1 shows a perspective view of a clamping device according to an embodiment of the invention, selected by way of example only, said device being intended to be mounted on a profile member,<br>
Figures 2 and 3 show two different perspective views of a first clamping jaw forming part of the device according to Figure 1,<br>
Figures 4 and 5 show two different perspective views of a second clamping jaw forming part of the device according to Figure 1,<br><br>
Figure 6 shows a side elevation of the clamping device according to Figure 1, illustrating said device mounted on a circular-cylindric tube having a comparatively large diameter,<br>
Figure 7 shows a side elevation of the clamping device according to Figure 1, illustrating said device mounted on a circular-cylindric tube having a smaller diameter,<br>
Figure 8 shows a side elevation of the clamping device according to Figure 1, illustrating said device mounted on a circular-cylindric tube having a still smaller diameter, and<br>
Figure 9 shows a side elevation of the clamping device according to Figure 1, illustrating said device mounted on an angle profile member.<br>
The clamping device shown in the drawings comprises two clamping jaws 10 and 11 which are intended to be placed in front of each other at opposite sides of the profile member P on which the clamping device is to be mounted. Each of the two clamping jaws 10 and 11 comprises an inner portion 12 and 13, respectively, and two flat end portions 14 and 15, projecting in mutually opposite directions from the inner portion and formed integrally with said portion and lying in a common plane. End portions 14 and 15 are provided with through holes 16 and 17, respectively, for threaded clamping bolts 18 by means of which the two clamping jaws 10 and 11 can be brought to bear under pressure against profile member P with contact surfaces formed by their inner portions 12 and 13, respectively.<br>
In the embodiment shown in the drawings, inner portion 12 of clamping jaw 10 is provided with profiled contact surfaces 19 and 20 of mutually different shapes at mutually opposite sides of said portion. As a consequence, clamping jaw 10 may be turned at choice with<br><br>
one of the other side thereof against profile member P. Hereby, a substantially increased possibility of adapting the device to different profile members of strongly varying shapes and dimensions is achieved.<br>
Inner portion 13 of clamping jaw 11, on the other hand, is provided with a profiled contact surface 21, intended to bear against profile member P, only at its one side, The reason is that, at its other side, said portion is provided with two projecting flanges 22 which are intended to serve as supporting means for one or more outer elements that may be affixed to the device.<br>
At its one side, inner portion 12 of clamping jaw 10 has the general shape of a projection 23, protruding from said clamping jaw and forming contact surface 19, while at its other side, it has the general shape of a recess 2 4 of obtuse-angled V-shaped profile, provided in said clamping jaw and forming contact surface 20. Along the major portion of its length, projection 2 3, which at its middle is provided with a generally V-shaped recess 25, has a height above the common plane of the two end portions 14 which decreases in a direction from the middle of said projection and towards each end thereof. Nearest to the bottom of recess 25, the two opposite walls of the recess form an angle of 9 0"  with each other, while the portions of said walls located nearest to the opening of the recess form a larger angle with each other.<br>
A its one side, inner portion 13 of clamping jaw 11 has the general shape of a recess 26 of 90"^ V-shaped profile, provided in said clamping jaw and forming contact surface 21.<br>
Clamping jaws 10 and 11 may preferably consist of pieces which have been cut from extruded aluminium profiles and which, after the cutting operation, have been provided with the required through holes 1,6 and 17,<br><br>
respectively, for the clamping bolts 18. Furthermore, each of the two clamping jaws may suitably be symmetrical around a central plane, extending in a direction transversal to the longitudinal direction of the clamping jaw in question.<br>
The invention is not restricted to the embodiment above described and shown in the drawings. Instead, many other embodiments are feasible within the scope of the invention as defined in the following claims, In this connection, it is especially emphasized that both clamping jaws may be provided with a profiled contact surface at each of their mutually opposite sides so that each clamping jaw may be turned at choice with one or the other of its two sides against the profile member.<br><br><br><br><br>
