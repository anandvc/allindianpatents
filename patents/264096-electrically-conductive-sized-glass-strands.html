ELECTRICALLY CONDUCTIVE SIZED GLASS STRANDS<br>
	The present invention relates to glass strands coated<br>
	with a size capable of conducting an electric current,<br>
5	said strands being intended to reinforce organic<br>
	materials of the polymer type, so as to obtain<br>
	composites.<br>
	The invention also relates to the sizing composition<br>
10	used to coat said strands, to the method for producing<br>
	the composites from these strands, and to the resulting<br>
	composites.<br>
	Conventionally, glass reinforcing strands are produced<br>
15	by mechanically attenuating molten glass streams<br>
	flowing out from numerous orifices in a bushing filled<br>
	with molten glass, under gravity, through the effect of<br>
	the hydrostatic pressure due to the height of the<br>
	liquid, in order to form filaments that are assembled<br>
20	into base strands, said strands then being collected on<br>
	a suitable support.<br>
	During the attenuation, and before they are assembled<br>
	into strands, the glass filaments are coated with a<br>
25	sizing composition, generally an aqueous composition,<br>
	by passing them over a sizing member.<br>
	The size is essential on several counts.<br>
30	During manufacture of the strands, it protects the<br>
	filaments from the abrasion that results from them<br>
	rubbing, at high speed, on the members for attenuating<br>
	and winding the strand by acting as a lubricant. The<br>
	size also provides the strand with cohesion, by<br>
35	ensuring that the filaments are linked together.<br>
	Finally, it makes the strand sufficiently integral to<br>
	withstand the rewinding operations necessary for<br>
	forming, in particular, "assembled" rovings from<br>
	several base strands, and it also makes it possible for<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
	the electrostatic charges generated during these<br>
	operations to be eliminated.<br>
	During use for the purpose of producing composites, the<br>
5	size improves the impregnation of the strand by the<br>
	matrix to be reinforced and it promotes adhesion<br>
	between the glass and said matrix, thus resulting in<br>
	composites with improved mechanical properties.<br>
	Furthermore, the size protects the strands from<br>
10	chemical and environmental attack, thereby helping to<br>
	increase their durability. In applications requiring<br>
	the strand to be chopped, the size prevents the<br>
	filaments from splaying out and separating, and,<br>
	together with the oversize, it contributes to<br>
15	dispersing the electrostatic charges generated during<br>
	chopping.<br>
	The glass strands in their various forms (continuous,<br>
	chopped or ground strands, mats, meshes, wovens, knits,<br>
20	etc.) are commonly used for the effective reinforcement<br>
	of matrices of various types, for example thermoplastic<br>
	or thermosetting organic materials and inorganic<br>
	materials, for example cement.<br>
25	The invention is applicable here to reinforcing strands<br>
	that are incorporated into polymer matrices of the<br>
	thermosetting type in order to manufacture either<br>
	impregnated mats or SMCs (Sheet Molding Compounds),<br>
	which may be formed directly by molding in a hot<br>
30	compression mold, or pastes intended to be molded using<br>
	the BMC (Bulk Molding Compound) technique.<br>
	An SMC is a semifinished product in which a glass<br>
	strand mat is combined with a paste of a thermosetting<br>
35	resin, in particular one chosen from polyesters.<br>
	In the SMC, the glass acts as reinforcement and<br>
	provides the mechanical properties and dimensional<br>
	stability of the molded parts. It generally represents<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
	25 to 60% of the weight of the SMC. Usually, the glass<br>
	is in the form of chopped strands, even though<br>
	continuous strands may be used for some applications.<br>
	The paste comprises the thermosetting resin and<br>
5	fillers, and optionally additives, such as initiators,<br>
	viscosity regulators and mold release agents.<br>
	As is known, an SMC is manufactured by depositing a<br>
	first paste layer on a film supported by a conveyor<br>
10	belt, by chopping strands unwound from rovings by means<br>
	of a rotary chopper to a length of 12 to 50 millimeters<br>
	on top of the resin, the strands being randomly<br>
	(isotropically) distributed, and by depositing a second<br>
	paste layer supported by a film, the resin face being<br>
15	turned toward the glass. The combination of the various<br>
	layers then passes through the nip of one or more<br>
	calendering devices so as to impregnate glass strands<br>
	with the resin and to remove the trapped air.<br>
20	An SMC must also undergo a maturation treatment, for<br>
	the purpose of increasing the viscosity of the resin,<br>
	up to an imposed value of 40-100 Pa.s so as to allow it<br>
	to be properly molded.<br>
25	Molding with SMCs allows the production of individual<br>
	parts, in medium or long runs, which are less expensive<br>
	in particular owing to the fact that the SMC is<br>
	deposited directly in the mold without it being<br>
	required to cut it precisely to the dimensions thereof.<br>
30<br>
	What distinguishes a BMC from an SMC is the form, which<br>
	here is a paste intended to be injected into a<br>
	compression mold.<br>
35	The parts produced by these molding techniques are used<br>
	in particular in the automotive field as a replacement<br>
	for body parts or impact protection parts, which are<br>
	currently made of metal, especially steel.<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
	However, automobile manufacturers are constantly<br>
	preoccupied with reducing the weight of vehicles as<br>
	much as possible, so as to reduce the fuel consumption.<br>
	To do this, it has been envisioned to substitute<br>
5	certain metal parts of the body with lighter parts made<br>
	of composites.<br>
	The problem that arises with parts made of composites<br>
	is that of painting.<br>
10<br>
	The operation of painting metal parts is carried out on<br>
	an industrial scale by cataphoresis. This consists in<br>
	electrostatically depositing one or more primer coats<br>
	in order to "smooth" the surface, and one or more paint<br>
15	coats.<br>
	Composite parts cannot be used as such as the polymer<br>
	material is an electrical insulator. It is therefore<br>
	necessary to make them conductive in order to be able<br>
20	to use them on conventional cataphoretic painting<br>
	lines.<br>
	Solutions aiming to make composites electrically<br>
	conductive have been disclosed.<br>
25<br>
	US 6 648 593 proposes, prior to application of the<br>
	paint, to deposit a first coat of a conductive paint<br>
	comprising a resin and conductive particles (in the<br>
	form of whiskers), and a second metal coat applied<br>
30	without intervention of the electric current.<br>
	This solution requires the addition of other steps that<br>
	are difficult to implement in the current process, and<br>
	consequently it generates an additional cost.<br>
35<br>
	WO-A-03/0 511 992 and US-A-2003/0 042 468 propose a<br>
	composition intended to be used in molding processes,<br>
	which comprises a crosslinkable prepolymer, at least<br>
	one unsaturated monomer copolymerizable with the<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
	prepolymer, a copolymerization initiator and<br>
	electrically conductive fillers, for example graphite,<br>
	metal-coated particles or metal particles.<br>
5	The processing of the composition is made difficult by<br>
	the high conductive filler content needed to obtain a<br>
	high level of conduction. Thus, the conductive fillers<br>
	are incorporated directly into the matrix. This greatly<br>
	increases the viscosity - impregnation of the glass<br>
10	strand is made more difficult and the pressure to be<br>
	applied for molding has to be increased. The solution<br>
	consisting in increasing the amount of solvent in order<br>
	to reduce the viscosity has other drawbacks - it<br>
	reduces the mechanical properties of the composite and<br>
15	generates microbubbles that impair the quality of the<br>
	surface finish of the final parts.<br>
	The object of the present invention is to provide<br>
	reinforcing strands that are particularly suitable for<br>
20	SMC production and are capable of conducting an<br>
	electric current so as to obtain molded parts made of<br>
	composites that can be cataphoretically treated.<br>
	One subject of the invention is glass strands coated<br>
25	with an aqueous sizing composition which comprises at<br>
	least one film-forming agent, at least one compound,<br>
	chosen from plasticizers, surfactants and dispersants,<br>
	at least one coupling agent for coupling to the glass<br>
	and electrically conductive particles.<br>
30<br>
	In the present invention, the expression "glass strands<br>
	coated with a sizing composition that comprises ..." is<br>
	understood to mean not only glass strands coated with<br>
	the composition in question, such as those obtained<br>
35	immediately on leaving the sizing member(s), but also<br>
	the same strands that have undergone one or more other<br>
	subsequent treatments. Examples that may be mentioned<br>
	include the drying treatment, for the purpose of<br>
	removing water, and the treatments that lead to the<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
	polymerization/crosslinking of certain constituents of<br>
	the sizing composition.<br>
	Again within the context of the invention, the term<br>
5	"strands" should be understood to mean the base strands<br>
	resulting from the twist-free assembly of a multitude<br>
	of filaments, and the products derived from these<br>
	strands, especially assemblies of these base strands in<br>
	the form of rovings. Such assemblies may be obtained by<br>
10	simultaneously paying out base strands from several<br>
	packages and then assembling said strands into tows<br>
	that are wound onto a rotating support. They may also<br>
	be "direct" rovings with a titer (or linear density)<br>
	equivalent to that of assembled rovings obtained by<br>
15	gathering the filaments directly beneath the bushing<br>
	and winding onto a rotating support.<br>
	Also according to the invention, the expression<br>
	"aqueous sizing composition" is understood to mean a<br>
20	composition that can be deposited on the filaments<br>
	during attenuation, which composition is in the form of<br>
	a suspension or dispersion comprising at least 70%,<br>
	preferably 75%, by weight of water and possibly<br>
	containing, where appropriate, less than 10%,<br>
25	preferably less than 5%, by weight of one or more<br>
	essentially organic solvents helping to dissolve<br>
	certain constituents of the sizing composition. In the<br>
	majority of cases, the composition contains no organic<br>
	solvent, especially so as to limit the emission of<br>
30	volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into the atmosphere.<br>
	The film-forming agent according to the invention acts<br>
	in several ways: it gives the coating mechanical<br>
	cohesion, by making the conductive particles adhere to<br>
35	the glass filaments and ensuring that these particles<br>
	are linked together, where appropriate with the<br>
	material to be reinforced; it helps to bind the<br>
	filaments together; finally, it protects the strands<br>
	from any mechanical damage and from chemical and<br><br>
-	7 –<br>
	environmental attack.<br>
	The film-forming agent is a polymer chosen from<br>
	polyvinyl acetates (homopolymers or copolymers, for<br>
5	example vinyl acetate/ethylene copolymers), polyesters,<br>
	epoxies, polyacrylics (homopolymers or copolymers),<br>
	polyurethanes, polyamides (homopolymers or copolymers,<br>
	for example polyamide/polystyrene or<br>
	polyamide/polyoxyethylene block copolymers), cellulose<br>
10	polymers and blends of these compounds. Polyvinyl<br>
	acetates, epoxies and polyurethanes are preferred.<br>
	The plasticizer lowers the glass transition temperature<br>
	of the film-forming agent, giving the size flexibility<br>
15	and limiting shrinking after drying.<br>
	The surfactant improves the suspension and dispersion<br>
	of the conductive particles and promotes compatibility<br>
	between the other constituents and water. It may be<br>
20	chosen from cationic, anionic or nonionic compounds.<br>
	To avoid stability and ununiform particle dispersion<br>
	problems in the sizing composition, it is preferred to<br>
	use cationic or nonionic surfactants.<br>
25<br>
	The dispersant helps to disperse the conductive<br>
	particles in the water and to reduce their<br>
	sedimentation.<br>
30	The plasticizers, surfactants and dispersants may<br>
	possess one or more functions specific to each of the<br>
	abovementioned categories. The choice of these agents<br>
	and the amount to be used depend on the film-forming<br>
	agent and on the conductive particles.<br>
35<br>
	These agents may especially be chosen from:<br>
		&gt;	 organic compounds, in particular:<br>
-		optionally halogenated, aliphatic or<br>
		aromatic, polyalkoxylated compounds, such as<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
	ethoxylated/propoxylated alkylphenols, preferably<br>
	containing 1 to 30 ethylene oxide groups and 0 to<br>
	15 propylene oxide groups, ethoxylated/propoxylated<br>
	bisphenols, preferably containing 1 to 40 ethylene<br>
5	oxide groups and 0 to 20 propylene oxide groups,<br>
	ethoxylated/propoxylated fatty alcohols, preferably<br>
	the alkyl chain of which comprises 8 to 20 carbon<br>
	atoms, and containing 2 to 50 ethylene oxide groups<br>
	and up to 20 propylene oxide groups. These<br>
10	polyalkoxylated compounds may be block copolymers<br>
	or random copolymers,<br>
		- polyalkoxylated fatty acid esters, for<br>
	example polyethyleneglycol, the alkyl chain of<br>
	which preferably comprises 8 to 20 carbon atoms,<br>
15	and containing 2 to 50 ethylene oxide groups and up<br>
	to 20 propylene oxide groups and<br>
		- amine compounds, for example optionally<br>
	alkoxylated amines, a*nine oxides, alkylamides,<br>
	sodium, potassium or ammonium succinates and<br>
20	taurates, sugar derivatives, especially sorbitan,<br>
	and sodium, potassium or ammonium alkyl sulfates<br>
	and alkyl phosphates; and<br>
	&gt; inorganic compounds, for example silica<br>
	derivatives, these compounds possibly being used by<br>
25	themselves or as a mixture with the aforementioned<br>
	organic compounds.<br>
	The electrically conductive particles confer electrical<br>
	conductivity on the glass strands and the level of<br>
30	performance depends on the amount of particles present<br>
	on the strands. According to the invention, these are<br>
	carbon-based particles, especially graphite and/or<br>
	carbon black particles.<br>
35	The origin of the graphite - natural or synthetic - has<br>
	no appreciable impact on the electrical conductivity.<br>
	It therefore does not matter whether one or other type<br>
	of graphite, by itself or as a blend, is used.<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
	The particles may have any shape - for example they may<br>
	be spheres, flakes or needles. However, it has been<br>
	found that the electrical conductivity of a blend of<br>
	particles of different shapes is improved compared with<br>
5	the same amount of particles but of the same shape.<br>
	Blends combining two shapes (binary blend) or three<br>
	shapes (ternary blend) of particles prove to be<br>
	advantageous.<br>
10	Preferably, 30 to 60% of the conductive particles have<br>
	a high aspect ratio (defined by the ratio of the<br>
	longest dimension to the shortest), this ratio<br>
	preferably varying from 5 to 20, especially around 10,<br>
	and advantageously at least 15% of the particles are in<br>
15	the form of flakes or needles.<br>
	Like the shape, the size of the particles is an<br>
	important parameter as regards electrical conductivity.<br>
	As a general rule, the size of the particles taken<br>
20	along their longest dimension does not exceed 250 urn,<br>
	preferably 100 urn.<br>
	It is advantageous to combine the aforementioned<br>
	particles, generally made of graphite, with a carbon<br>
25	black powder that conducts electric current, with a<br>
	particle size not exceeding 1 μm, preferably having a<br>
	mean size of less than 100 nm. The carbon black<br>
	particles, owing to their small size, create points of<br>
	contact between the graphite particles, thereby further<br>
30	improving the electrical conductivity.<br>
	The coupling agent ensures that the size is attached to<br>
	the surface of the glass.<br>
35	The coupling agent is chosen from hydrolyzable<br>
	compounds, especially in acid medium containing, for<br>
	example, citric acid or acetic acid, these compounds<br>
	belonging to the group consisting of silanes, such as<br>
	γ-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane, γ-acryloxypropyl-<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
	trimethoxysilane, γ-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane,<br>
	poly(oxyethylene/oxypropylene) trimethoxysilane, γ-<br>
	aminopropyltriethoxysilane, vinyltrimethoxysilane,<br>
	phenylaminopropyltrimethoxysilane or styrylaminoethyl-<br>
5	aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, siloxanes, titanates,<br>
	zirconates and blends of these compounds. Preferably,<br>
	silanes are chosen.<br>
	In addition to the aforementioned constituents that<br>
10	essentially contribute to the structure of the size,<br>
	one or more other constituents may be present.<br>
	Thus, a viscosity regulator may be introduced, so as to<br>
	adjust the viscosity of the composition to the<br>
15	conditions of applying the size to the filaments, in<br>
	general this viscosity being between 5 and 80 mPa.s and<br>
	preferably at least 7 mPa.s. This regulator also helps<br>
	to stabilize the dispersion of particles so that they<br>
	do not form a sedimented deposit too rapidly and do not<br>
20	migrate to the outside and lie on the surface of the<br>
	package when winding the strand.<br>
	The viscosity regulator is chosen from highly<br>
	hydrophilic compounds, that is to say those that are<br>
25	able to capture a large amount of water, such as<br>
	carboxymethyl celluloses, guar or xanthan gums,<br>
	carrageenans, alginates, polyacrylics, polyamides,<br>
	polyethylene glycols, especially those with a molecular<br>
	weight of greater than 100 000, and blends of these<br>
30	compounds.<br>
	The size may also include the usual additives for glass<br>
	strands, namely lubricants, such as mineral oils, fatty<br>
	esters, for example isopropyl palmitate or butyl<br>
35	stearate, alkylamines, complexing agents, such as EDTA<br>
	and gallic acid derivatives, and antifoams, such as<br>
	silicones, polyols and vegetable oils.<br>
	All of the abovementioned compounds contribute to the<br><br>
- 11 -<br>
	production of glass strands that can be easily<br>
	manufactured, are able to be used as reinforcements,<br>
	and which are incorporated without any problem into the<br>
	resin during manufacture of the composites and also<br>
5	possess electrical conduction properties.<br>
	As a general rule, the amount of size represents 2 to<br>
	7%, preferably 3.5 to 6%, of the weight of the final<br>
	strand.<br>
10<br>
	The conductive strand according to the invention may be<br>
	made of glass of any kind, for example E-glass, C-<br>
	glass, R-glass or AR-glass, and glass with a low boron<br>
	content (less than 6%). E-glass and AR-glass are<br>
15	preferred.<br>
	The diameter of the glass filaments constituting the<br>
	strands may vary widely, for example from 5 to 30 urn.<br>
	Likewise, wide variations may occur in the linear<br>
20	density of the strand used, such as an assembled<br>
	roving, for which the linear density ranges from 68 to<br>
	4800 tex depending on the intended applications, this<br>
	roving possibly being formed from base strands whose<br>
	linear density varies from 17 to 320 tex.<br>
25<br>
	Another subject of the invention is the sizing<br>
	composition itself, before it has been deposited on the<br>
	glass filaments. It comprises the aforementioned<br>
	constituents and water.<br>
30<br>
	The sizing composition comprises (in % by weight):<br>
		-	2 to 10%, preferably 3 to 8.5%, of at least<br>
	one film-forming agent;<br>
		-	0.2 to 8%, preferably 0.25 to 6%, of at least<br>
35	one compound chosen from plasticizers, surfactants and<br>
	dispersants;<br>
		-	4 to 25%, preferably 6 to 20%, of<br>
	electrically conductive particles;<br>
		-	0.1 to 4%, preferably 0.15 to 2%, of at least<br><br>
- 12 -<br>
	one coupling agent;<br>

	one viscosity regulator; and<br>

5<br>
	The amount of water to be used is determined so as to<br>
	obtain a solids content that varies from 8 to 35%,<br>
	preferably 12 to 25%.<br>
10	The preparation of the sizing composition is carried<br>
	out as follows:<br>
		a) producing a dispersion D of the conductive<br>
	particles in water containing the dispersant;<br>
		b) introducing the other components of the size,<br>
15	namely the film-forming agents, the plasticizers, the<br>
	surfactants, the coupling agents, in hydrolyzed form,<br>
	and, where appropriate, the viscosity regulators and<br>
	the additives, in water in order to form an emulsion E;<br>
	and<br>
20		c) blending the dispersion D with the emulsion<br>
	E.<br>
	Advantageously, steps a) and c) are carried out with<br>
	sufficient stirring to prevent the risk of<br>
25	sedimentation of the conductive particles.<br>
	When a viscosity regulator is used, it is introduced at<br>
	step b) firstly in the form of an aqueous solution,<br>
	where necessary heated to about 80°C so that it<br>
30	dissolves more easily.<br>
	In general, the dispersion D is stable under the usual<br>
	storage conditions at a temperature of 20 to 25°C. In<br>
	particular, it may be used without major drawback over<br>
35	a period of about six months, where necessary stirring<br>
	it before use if the particles have sedimented.<br>
	However, the sizing composition should be used almost<br>
	immediately after it has been prepared, preferably<br><br>
- 13 -<br>
	within a period of time not exceeding about four days<br>
	under the aforementioned storage conditions. As<br>
	previously, the particles that have sedimented may be<br>
	redispersed without the properties of the composition<br>
5	being affected thereby.<br>
	As mentioned previously, the aqueous solution is<br>
	deposited on the filaments before they are assembled<br>
	into base strand (s) . The water is usually removed by<br>
10	drying the strands after collection.<br>
	Yet another subject of the invention is a composite, in<br>
	particular an SMC or a BMC, in which at least one<br>
	thermosetting polymer material is combined with<br>
15	reinforcing strands, said strands consisting partly or<br>
	completely of glass strands coated with the sizing<br>
	composition described above. The glass content in the<br>
	composite is generally between 5 and 60% by weight.<br>
20	According to a first embodiment, the composite is in<br>
	the form of an SMC having a glass content of between 10<br>
	to 60%, preferably of 20 to 45%, by weight.<br>
	According to a second embodiment, the composite is in<br>
25	the form of a BMC having a glass content of between 5<br>
	to 20% by weight.<br>
	Preferably, the thermosetting polymer material is a<br>
	phenolic resin.<br>
30<br>
	A further subject of the invention is the use of the<br>
	sized glass strands according to the invention for<br>
	producing electrically conductive molded parts using<br>
	the technique of compression molding, said strands<br>
35	being used in particular in SMC. or BMC form.<br>
	As already mentioned, the molded parts can be painted<br>
	on standard lines for applying paint cataphoretically,<br>
	especially for the production of automobile parts.<br><br>
- 14 -<br>
	Hitherto, it was considered that a part molded from an<br>
	SMC or BMC could be coated with paint under the<br>
	aforementioned conditions when it has in particular a<br>
5	surface resistivity of between 0.5 and 1.5 MΩ/D.<br>
	The inventors have discovered that a part having an<br>
	"internal" resistivity, that is to say a volume<br>
	resistivity as may be conferred by a layer of<br>
10	conductive fibers within the matrix, for example of the<br>
	order of 0.01 to 1000 MΩ.m, could also be treated under<br>
	the same conditions.<br>
	As a result, the size with which the glass strands are<br>
15	coated does not necessarily have to possess a high<br>
	solubility in the matrix to be reinforced, so that the<br>
	conductive particles are dispersed throughout the part<br>
	in order that it can undergo the cataphoretic painting<br>
	treatment. A size that is only slightly soluble in the<br>
20	matrix, for example containing one or more<br>
	polyurethanes as film-forming agent, or even one that<br>
	is insoluble, may consequently be suitable for applying<br>
	paint to such molded parts.<br>
25	The use of the conductive glass strand according to the<br>
	invention is not limited to the SMC or BMC molding<br>
	technique. More generally, the glass strands can be<br>
	used in any technique for manufacturing composites<br>
	involving a reinforcement in the form of glass strands<br>
30	that advantageously requires electrical conduction. In<br>
	particular, the glass strands may be in the form of a<br>
	mat or veil, especially one that can be used as an SMC<br>
	surface coating or reinforcing element, said strands<br>
	possibly being combined with other reinforcing strands,<br>
35	especially glass strands.<br>
	The strands according to the invention may thus be used<br>
	in all fields in which it is desired to achieve thermal<br>
	conduction and heat dispersion properties, for example<br><br>
- 15 -<br>
	in the domestic electrical appliance and automotive<br>
	fields. These strands may also be used for<br>
	electromagnetic shielding applications, especially in<br>
	the transport field, in particular in automobiles, in<br>
5	the building field and in fields requiring protection<br>
	of electronic components, especially those relating to<br>
	magnetic media for storing data.<br>
	The examples given below illustrate the invention<br>
10	without however limiting it.<br>
	In these examples, the following methods were used:<br>
	- On the glass strand:<br>
		→ the loss on ignition of the sized glass strand<br>
15	was measured under the conditions in the ISO 1887<br>
	standard. This loss on ignition is given in %;<br>
		→ the flock was measured by making the tows, paid<br>
	out from two rovings, pass simultaneously over a turn<br>
	roll at a speed of 200 m/min. The flock is defined by<br>
20	the amount of fibrils obtained after a 3 kg mass of<br>
	strand has unwound, and it is expressed in mg/100 g of<br>
	strand;<br>
		→ the tenacity of the strand was determined by<br>
	measuring the tensile breaking force under the<br>
25	conditions in the ISO 3341 standard. The tenacity is<br>
	expressed in N/tex;<br>
		→ the linear resistivity, in MΩ/cm, was obtained<br>
	by calculating it from the equation:<br>
	ρ = R/l<br>
30	in which		ρ is the resistivity in MΩ/cm<br>
				R is the resistance in MΩ and<br>
				1 is the length of the fiber in cm,<br>
	the resistance R being measured using an ohmmeter and<br>
	the distance between the two electrodes being 20 cm.<br>
35	- On the molded part:<br>
		→ the surface resistivity, in MΩ/D, was measured<br>
	according to the NF EN 1149-1 standard;<br>
		→ the "internal" resistivity, in MΩ.m, was<br>
	measured on a plaque, obtained according to the<br><br>
- 16 -<br>
	aforementioned NF EN 1149-1 standard, drilled with two<br>
	holes 20 cm apart. A metal rivet (diameter: 4 mm)<br>
	serving as connector was inserted into each hole, said<br>
	connectors being connected to the electrodes of an<br>
5	ohmmeter. The internal resistivity was calculated from<br>
	the equation:<br>
	ρ' = R'S/d<br>
	in which			ρ' is the internal resistivity, in MΩ.m<br>
					R' is the resistance, in MΩ<br>
10					S is the area of the plaque, in m2 and<br>
					d is the distance between the<br>
					connectors;<br>
			→ the flexural strength and the flexural modulus,<br>
	in MPa, and the deflection, in mm, were measured under<br>
15	the conditions in the ISO 14125-1 standard; and<br>
			→ the Charpy impact strength, in kJ/m2, was<br>
	measured under the conditions in the ISO 179-1 eU93<br>
	standard.<br>

15	The strand had a linear density of 96 tex and a loss on<br>

	An SMC was produced from this strand under the same<br>
	conditions as for Example 4.<br>
20<br>
	The molded part had a surface resistivity of lx105 MΩ/‭<br>
	and an internal resistivity of 0.1 MΩ.m.<br>
	The molded parts of Examples 4 to 6 have lower surface<br>
25	resistivity values than the control based on a<br>
	conventional, non electrically conductive, SMC.<br>
	The parts of Examples 5 and 6 also have a markedly<br>
	lower internal resistivity than the control (internal<br>
30	resistivity greater than 106 MΩ.m). The inventors<br>
	attribute this effect to the fact that the film-forming<br>
	agent present in the glass strand size is relatively<br>
	insoluble in the matrix. Thus, the conductive particles<br>
	remain on the strands, or in their immediate<br>
35	environment, and do not migrate to the surface of the<br>
	part. The conducting network formed by the glass<br>
	strands within the part gives an internal resistivity<br>
	sufficient to permit it to be cataphoretically painted.<br><br>
