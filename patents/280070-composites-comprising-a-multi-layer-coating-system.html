				<td>COMPOSITES COMPRISING A MULTI-LAYER COATING SYSTEM<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to composites comprising a multi-layer<br>
coating system.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Wind power is the conversion of wind energy into a useful form, such as<br>
electricity, using wind turbines. At the end of 2007, worldwide capacity of wind-powered<br>
generators was 94.1 gigawatts. Although wind currently produces just over 1 % of<br>
world-wide electricity use, it accounts for approximately 19% of electricity production in<br>
Denmark, 9% in Spain and Portugal, and 6% in Germany and the Republic of Ireland<br>
(2007 data). Globally, wind power generation increased more than fivefold between<br>
2000 and 2007.<br>
[0003] Wind power is produced in large scale wind farms connected to electrical<br>
grids, as well as in individual turbines for providing electricity to isolated locations. Wind<br>
turbines typically have 2 to 4 large blades and are designed to last around 20 to 25<br>
years. The optimum number of blades for a wind turbine depends on the job the turbine<br>
will do. Turbines for generating electricity need to operate at high speeds, but do not<br>
need much torque or turning force. These machines generally have two or three<br>
blades. Wind pumps, in contrast, operate with more torque but not much speed and<br>
therefore have many blades.<br>
[0004] Wind turbine blades, or "wind blades" are constantly exposed to the<br>
elements and are ideally designed to endure temperature extremes, wind shears,<br>
precipitation, and/or other environmental hazards with minimal failure. Coating failure is<br>
often observed on the leading edge of the blade. The "leading edge" of the blade will be<br>
understood as referring to the portion of the blade that cuts into the wind, while the<br>
trailing edge is the opposite edge. The leading edge can be smooth or comprise bumps<br>
or "tubercles" that help to reduce noise, increase stability and/or enable the blade to<br>
capture more energy. The leading edge is typically subjected to environmental factors<br>
such as salt, sand, dirt and other particulates causing dry abrasion, as well as<br>
environmental factors such as wind, rain, snow and the like. Accordingly, accelerated<br>
coating failure and/or corrosion may be observed on the leading edge. Additional<br>
protection on the leading edge is therefore often desired.<br>
[0005] It would be desirable to provide coating compositions to protect wind<br>
turbine blades and extend the service life of the blades. Ideally, these coating<br>
compositions could be applied to blade substrates with minimal substrate surface<br>
preparation and would provide leading edge erosion resistance.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006] The present invention is directed to a composite comprising a multi-layer<br>
coating system applied to at least a portion thereof, comprising:<br>
(1) a first coating layer deposited from a primer composition; and<br>
(2) a topcoat composition applied over at least a portion of the first coating<br>
layer in which the topcoat is deposited from a film-forming composition comprising:<br>
(a) a functional component comprising hydroxyl and/or amine groups;<br>
and<br>
(b) a curing agent comprising isocyanate and/or anhydride<br>
functional groups; and when the curing agent comprises isocyanate, the ratio of<br>
isocyanate to hydroxyl and/or amine groups is &gt; 1 :1.<br>
[0007] The present invention is further drawn to a topcoat composition applied<br>
over at least a portion of the first coating layer as described above in which the topcoat<br>
is deposited from a film-forming composition comprising a fluorinated acrylic.<br>
[0008] Other coated substrates, as well as methods of repairing substrates such<br>
as wind blades, are also within the scope of the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0009] Other than in any operating examples, or where otherwise indicated, all<br>
numbers expressing quantities of ingredients, reaction conditions and so forth used in<br>
the specification and claims are to be understood as being modified in all instances by<br>
the term "about." Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical<br>
parameters set forth in the following specification and attached claims are<br>
approximations that may vary depending upon the desired properties to be obtained by<br>
the present invention. At the very least, and not as an attempt to limit the application of<br>
•the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims, each numerical parameter should<br>
at least be construed in light of the number of reported significant digits and by applying<br>
ordinary rounding techniques. Including and like terms means including but not limited<br>
to.<br>
[0010] Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth<br>
the broad scope of the invention are approximations, the numerical values set forth in<br>
the specific examples are reported as precisely as possible. Any numerical value,<br>
however, inherently contain certain errors necessarily resulting from the standard<br>
deviation found in their respective testing measurements.<br>
[0011] Also, it should be understood that any numerical range recited herein is<br>
intended to include all sub-ranges subsumed therein. For example, a range of "1 to 10"<br>
is intended to include all sub-ranges between (and including) the recited minimum value<br>
of 1 and the recited maximum value of 10, that is, having a minimum value equal to or<br>
greater than 1 and a maximum value of equal to or less than 10.<br>
[0012] As used in this specification and the appended claims, the articles "a,"<br>
"an," and "the" include Rlural referents unless expressly and unequivocally limited to one<br>
referent. For example, although reference is made herein to "a" first coating layer, "a"<br>
primer composition, "a" topcoat, "a" curing agent and the like, one or more of each of<br>
these components, and of any other components, can be used.<br>
[0013] The various embodiments and examples of the present invention as<br>
presented herein are each understood to be non-limiting with respect to the scope of the<br>
invention.<br>
[0014] As used in the following description and claims, the following terms have<br>
the meanings indicated below:<br>
[0015] The term "curable", as used for example in connection with a curable<br>
composition, means that the indicated composition is polymerizable or cross linkable<br>
through functional groups, e.g., by means that include, but are not limited to, thermal<br>
(including ambient cure) and/or catalytic exposure.<br>
 [0016] The term "cure", "cured" or similar terms, as used in connection with a<br>
cured or curable composition, e.g., a "cured composition" of some specific description,<br>
means that at least a portion of the polymerizable and/or crosslinkable components that<br>
form the curable composition is polymerized and/or crosslinked. Additionally, curing-of<br>
a polymerizable composition refers to subjecting said composition to curing conditions<br>
such as but not limited to thermal curing, leading to the reaction ofthe reactive<br>
functional groups of the composition, and resulting in polymerization and formation of a<br>
polymerizate. When a polymerizable composition is subjected to curing conditions,<br>
following polymerization and after reaction of most of the reactive end groups occurs,<br>
the rate of reaction of the remaining unreacted reactive end groups becomes<br>
progressively slower. The polymerizable composition can be subjected to curing<br>
conditions until it is at least partially cured. The term "at least partially cured" means<br>
subjecting the polymerizable composition to curing conditions, wherein reaction of at<br>
least a portion of the reactive groups of the composition occurs, to form a polymerizate.<br>
[0017] The terms "reactive" and "functional" refer to a compound or group<br>
capable of undergoing a chemical reaction with itself and/or other functional groups<br>
and/or compounds spontaneously or upon the application of heat or in the presence of a<br>
catalyst or by any other means known to those skilled in the art..<br>
[0018] By "polymer" is meant a polymer including homopolymers and<br>
copolymers, and oligomers and the prefix "poly" means two or more.<br>
[0019] Film-forming compositions used as the first coating layer are primer<br>
coating compositions. A "primer" will be understood as generally referring to a coating<br>
applied as an undercoat or preparatory coating; that is, a coating that is covered by one<br>
or more additional coating layers. Often, a primer layer provides a functional advantage<br>
to a substrate. For example, a primer may serve to smooth or "fill in" pores or crevices<br>
on a substrate, impart corrosion resistance to a substrate, improve adhesion to the<br>
substrate, increase durability to subsequent coating layers, and/or impart chip<br>
resistance to subsequent coating layers. Examples of suitable primer coating<br>
compositions include any known to be useful as industrial primer coatings. In certain<br>
other embodiments of the present invention, the film-forming composition used as the<br>
first coating layer comprises a functional polymer containing an epoxide and/or hydroxyl<br>
group. For example, the film-forming composition used as the first coating layer may<br>
comprise one or more epoxy-functional polymers, each polymer typically having<br>
epoxide or oxirane groups. As used herein, "epoxy-functional polymers" means<br>
polymers comprising epoxy functionality. These materials often are referred to as di- or<br>
polyepoxides. Generally, the epoxide equivalent weight of the epoxy-functional polymer<br>
can range from 70 to 4,000, such as 140 to 600, as measured by titration with perchloric<br>
acid and quaternary ammonium bromide using methyl violet as an indicator.<br>
[0020] Suitable epoxy-functional polymers can be saturated or unsaturated, cyclic<br>
or acyclic, aliphatic, alicyclic, aromatic or heterocyclic. The epoxy-functional polymers<br>
can have pendant or terminal hydroxyl groups, if desired. They can contain substituents<br>
such as halogen, hydroxyl, and/or ether groups. A useful class of these materials<br>
includes polyepoxides comprising epoxy polyethers obtained by reacting an<br>
epihalohydrin (such as epichlorohydrin or epibromohydrin) with a di- or polyhydric<br>
alcohol in the presence of an alkali. Suitable polyhydric alcohols include polyphenols<br>
such as resorcinol; catechol; hydroquinone; bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2,2-propane, i.e.,<br>
bisphenol A; bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1, 1-isobutane; 4,4-dihydroxybenzophenone; bis(4-<br>
hydroxyphenol)-1 ,1-ethane; bis(2-hydroxyphenyl)-methane and 1,5-<br>
hydroxynaphthalene.<br>
[0021] Frequently used polyepoxides include diglycidyl ethers of Bisphenol A,<br>
such as EPON 828 or 1001 epoxy resins, which are commercially available from Shell<br>
Chemical Company. Other useful polyepoxides include polyglycidyl ethers of polyhydric<br>
alcohols, polyglycidyl esters of polycarboxylic acids, polyepoxides that are derived from<br>
the epoxidation of an olefinically unsaturated alicyclic compound, polyepoxides<br>
containing oxyalkylene groups in the epoxy molecule, epoxy novolac resins, and<br>
polyepoxides that are partially defunctionalized by carboxylic acids, alcohol, water,<br>
phenols, mercaptans or other active hydrogen-containing compounds to give hydroxylcontaining<br>
polymers. These polyepoxides are well known to those skilled in the art and<br>
are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,739,019 at column 2, line 6 through column 3, line 12,<br>
incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.<br>
[0022] In certain embodiments of the present invention, the film-forming<br>
composition used as the first coating layer comprises a polyurea and/or a polyurethane.<br>
Other suitable functional polymers used to form the polyurea and/or polyurethane<br>
include any of those discussed below as suitable for use as functional components in<br>
the topcoat composition.<br>
[0023] The amount of the functional polymer in the film-forming composition used<br>
in the first coating layer can vary depending in part upon the intended application of the<br>
composition. In certain embodiments, the functional polymer is present in an amount<br>
ranging from 10 to 90 percent by weight based on the total weight of resin solids in the<br>
film-forming composition, such as 35 to 60 weight percent, or 40 to 50 weight percent.<br>
[0024] One or more curing agents having functional groups reactive with the<br>
functionality on the functional polymer may also be used in the first coating layer, unless<br>
the functional polymer can react with itself, in which case additional curing agents may<br>
or may not be used. Useful curing agents for polyepoxide functional polymers include,<br>
for example, aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, and aromatic polyfunctional amines such as<br>
ethylene diamine, diethylene triamine, triethylene tetraamine, tetraethylene pentamine,<br>
1 ,4-diaminobutane; 1 ,3-diaminobutane, hexamethylene diamine, 3-(Nisopropylamino)<br>
propylamine, diaminocyclohexane, and polyoxypropylene amines<br>
commer9ially available under the trademark deSignation JEFFAMINE; meta-phenylene<br>
diamine; p,p'-methylene dianiline, and 1 ,4-aminonaphthalene; polyurea; polyamides<br>
such as those derived from polyacids, fatty acids, dimerized fatty acids or polymeric<br>
fatty acids and aliphatic polyamines, for example, the materials commercially available<br>
from Henckel under the trademark designations VERSAMIDE 220 or 125; imidazoles;<br>
dicyandiamide; and boron trifluoride complexes such as boron trifluoride<br>
monoethylamine complex, boron trifluoride diethylamine complex; boron trifluoride<br>
triethylamine complex; boron trifluoride pyridine complex; boron trifluoride<br>
benzyldimethylamine complex; boron trifluoride benzylamine, boron trifluoride etherate<br>
and as are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,739,019, at column 5, lines 24-62, incorporated<br>
by reference herein in its entirety. Useful curing agents for functional polymers<br>
containing hydroxyl groups include polyisocyanates and polyanhydrides discussed<br>
below as suitable for use in the topcoat composition.<br>
[0025] The curing agent, if used, can be present in the film-forming compositions<br>
of the first coating layer in an amount ranging from 10 to 90 percent by weight, such as<br>
40 to 65 percent by weight, or 50 to 60 percent by weight, based on the total weight of<br>
resin solids in the composition.<br>
[0026] The film-forming composition used in the first coating layer may further<br>
comprise a filler. Examples of fillers include finely divided minerals such as barium<br>
sulfate, silica, including fumed silica and/or colloidal silica, alumina, colloidal alumina,<br>
titanium dioxide, zirconia, colloidal zirconia, clay, mica, dolomite, talc, magnesium<br>
carbonate, calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate, calcium silicate, and/or calcium<br>
metasilicate. While not intending to be bound by any theory, it is believed that the<br>
fillers, in combination with the resins in the composition in certain embodiments of the<br>
present invention, allow for useful rheological properties such as high viscosity at low<br>
shear. The combination of fillers and resins in the first coating layer may also allow for<br>
filling and/or bridging of surface defects on a substrate, making the substrate surface<br>
smoother than would be possible with other coating compositions. In this manner, in<br>
certain embodiments the "primer" layer serves to fill voids in the composite substrate,<br>
thus presenting a smoother surface to which the topcoat is applied. The ability of the<br>
first coating layer to smooth surface defects on the substrate substantially decreases<br>
the need for substrate surface preparation such as by sanding and/or the use of body<br>
putty before applying the first coating layer, which can be time-consuming, laborintensive,<br>
and expensive manufacturing steps, although putty or other pretreatment can<br>
be used when necessary. This advantage is particularly useful in the coating of large<br>
substrate parts or substrates with significant surface roughness, such as composites<br>
used in the manufacturing of wind blades.<br>
[0027] The film-forming composition used as the first coating layer can include a<br>
variety of optional ingredients and/or additives that are somewhat dependent on the<br>
particular application of the composition, such as one or more of curing catalysts,<br>
titanium dioxide, carbon black, graphite or other colorants, reinforcements, thixotropes,<br>
accelerators, surfactants, plasticizers, extenders, stabilizers, corrosion inhibitors,<br>
diluents, and/or antioxidants.<br>
[0028] The film-forming composition used as the first coating layer may include a<br>
colorant. As used herein, the term "colorant" means any substance that imparts color<br>
and/or other opacity and/or other visual effect to the composition. The colorant can be<br>
added to the coating in any suitable form, such as discrete particles, dispersions,<br>
solutions and/or flakes. A single colorant or a mixture of two or more colorants can be<br>
used in the coatings of the present invention.<br>
[0029] Example colorants include pigments, dyes and tints, such as those used in<br>
the paint industry and/or listed in the Dry Color Manufacturers Association (DCMA), as<br>
well as special effect compositions. A colorant may include, for example, a finely<br>
divided solid powder that is insoluble but wettable under the conditions of use. A<br>
colorant can be organic or inorganic and can be agglomerated or non-agglomerated.<br>
Colorants can be incorporated into the coatings by grinding or simple mixing. Colorants<br>
can be incorporated by grinding into the coating by use of a grind vehicle, such as an<br>
acrylic grind vehicle, the use of which will be familiar to one skilled in the art.<br>
[0030] Example pigments and/or pigment compositions include, but are not<br>
limited to, carbazole dioxazine crude pigment, azo, monoazo, disazo, naphthol AS, salt<br>
type (lakes), benzimidazolone, condensation, metal complex, isoindolinone, isoindoline<br>
and polycyclic phthalocyanine, quinacridone, perylene, perinone, diketopyrrolo pyrrole,<br>
thioindigo, anthraquinone, indanthrone, anthrapyrimidine, flavanthrone, pyranthrone,<br>
anthanthrone, dioxazine, triarylcarbonium, quinophthalone pigments, diketo pyrrolo<br>
pyrrole red ("DPPBO red"), titanium dioxide, carbon black and mixtures thereof. The<br>
terms "pigment" and "colored filler" can be used interchangeably.<br>
[0031] Example dyes include, but are not limited to, those that are solvent and/or<br>
aqueous based such as acid dyes, azoic dyes, basic dyes, direct dyes, disperse dyes,<br>
reactive dyes, solvent dyes, sulfur dyes, mordant dyes, for example, bismuth vanadate,<br>
anthraquinone, perylene, aluminum, quinacridone, thiazole, thiazine, azo, indigoid, nitro,<br>
nitroso, oxazine, phthalocyanine, quinoline, stilbene, and triphenyl methane.<br>
[0032] Example tints include, but are not limited to, pigments dispersed in waterbased<br>
or water miscible carriers such as AQUA-CHEM 896 commercially available from<br>
Degussa, Inc., CHARISMA COLORANTS and MAXITONER INDUSTRIAL<br>
COLORANTS commercially available from Accurate Dispersions division of Eastman<br>
Chemical, Inc.<br>
[0033] As noted above, the colorant can be in the form of a dispersion including,<br>
but not limited to, a nanoparticle dispersion. Nanoparticle dispersions can include one<br>
or more highly dispersed nanoparticle colorants and/or colorant particles that produce a<br>
desired visible color and/or opacity and/or visual effect. Nanoparticle dispersions can<br>
include colorants such as pigments or dyes having a particle size of less than 150 nm,<br>
such as less than 70 nm, or less than 30 nm. Nanoparticles can be produced by milling<br>
stock organic or inorganic pigments with grinding media having a particle size of less<br>
than 0.5 mm. Example nanoparticle dispersions and methods for making them are<br>
identified in U.S. Patent No. 6,875,800 82, which is incorporated herein by reference in<br>
its entirety. Nanoparticle dispersions can also be produced by crystallization,<br>
precipitation, gas phase condensation, and chemical attrition (i.e., partial dissolution).<br>
In order to minimize re-agglomeration of nanoparticles within the coating, a dispersion<br>
of resin-coatoo nanoparticles can be used. As used herein, a "dispersion of resincoated<br>
nanoparticles" refers to a continuous phase in which is dispersed discreet<br>
"composite microparticles" that comprise a nanoparticle and a resin coating on the<br>
nanoparticle. Example dispersions of resin-coated nanoparticles and methods for<br>
making them are identified in U.S. Application No.1 0/876,031 filed June 24, 2004,<br>
which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, and U.S. Provisional Application<br>
No. 60/482,167 filed June 24, 2003, which is also incorporated herein by reference in its<br>
entirety.<br>
[0034] Example special effect compositions that may be used in the coating of<br>
the present invention include pigments and/or compositions that produce one or more<br>
appearance effects such as reflectance, pearlescence, metallic sheen,<br>
phosphorescence, fluorescence, photochromism, photosensitivity, thermochromism,<br>
goniochromism and/or color-change. Additional special effect compositions can provide<br>
other perceptible properties, such as reflectivity, opacity or texture. In a non-limiting<br>
embodiment, special effect compositions can produce a color shift, such that the color<br>
of the coating changes when the coating is viewed at different angles. Example color<br>
effect compositions are identified in U.S. Patent No. 6,894,086, incorporated herein by<br>
reference in its entirety. Additional color effect compositions can include transparent<br>
coated mica and/or synthetic mica, coated silica, coated alumina, a transparent liquid<br>
crystal pigment, a liquid crystal coating, and/or any composition wherein interference<br>
results from a refractive index differential within the material and not because of the<br>
refractive index differential between the surface of the material and the air.<br>
[0035] In certain non-limiting embodiments, a photosensitive composition and/or<br>
photochromic composition, which reversibly alters its color when exposed to one or<br>
more light sources, can be used in the coating of the present invention. Photochromic<br>
and/or photosensitive compositions can be activated by exposure to radiation of a<br>
specified wavelength. When the composition becomes excited, the molecular structure<br>
is changed and the altered structure exhibits a new color that is different from the<br>
original color of the composition. When the exposure to radiation is removed, the<br>
photochromic and/or photosensitive composition can return to a state of rest, in which<br>
the original color of the composition returns. In one non-limiting embodiment, the<br>
photochromic and/or photosensitive composition can be colorless in a non-excited state<br>
and exhibit a color in an excited state. Full color-change can appear within milliseconds<br>
to several minutes, such as from 20 seconds to 60 seconds. Example photochromic<br>
and/or photosensitive compositions include photochromic dyes.<br>
[0036] In a non-limiting embodiment, the photosensitive composition and/or<br>
photochromic composition can be associated with and/or at least partially bound to,<br>
such as by covalent bonding, a polymer and/or polymeric materials of a polymerizable<br>
component. In contrast to some coatings in which the photosensitive composition may<br>
migrate out of the coating and crystallize into the substrate, the photosensitive<br>
composition and/or photochromic composition associated with and/or at least partially<br>
bound to a polymer and/or polymerizable component in accordance with a non-limiting<br>
embodiment of the present invention, have minimal migration out of the coating.<br>
Example photosensitive compositions and/or photochromic compositions and methods<br>
for making them are identified in U.S. Application Serial No.1 0/892,919 filed July 16,<br>
2004 and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
[0037] In general, the colorant can be present in the film-forming composition in<br>
any amount sufficient to impart the desired property, visual and/or color effect. The<br>
colorant may comprise from 1 to 65 weight percent of the present compositions, such as<br>
from 3 to 40 weight percent or 5 to 35 weight percent, with weight percent based on the<br>
total weight of the compositions.<br>
 [0038] The multi-layer coating system of the present invention further comprises<br>
a topcoat composition applied over at least a portion of the first coating layer. In certain<br>
embodiments, the topcoat is deposited from a film-forming composition comprising a<br>
functional component containing hydroxyl and/or amine groups (such as a polyamine or<br>
polymeric polyol) and a curing agent having isocyanate and/or anhydride functional<br>
groups.<br>
[0039] The functional component in the topcoat composition may comprise, for<br>
example, an acrylic polymer, a polyester polymer, a polyurethane polymer, a polyurea<br>
polymer and/or a polyether polymer. Often an acrylic polymer and/or polyester polymer<br>
is used.<br>
[0040] Suitable acrylic polymers include copolymers of one or more alkyl esters<br>
of acrylic acid or methacrylic acid, optionally together with one or more other<br>
polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monomers. Useful alkyl esters of acrylic acid or<br>
methacrylic acid include aliphatic alkyl esters containing from 1 to 30, such as 4 to 18<br>
carbon atoms in the alkyl group. Non-limiting examples include methyl methacrylate,<br>
ethyl methacrylate, butyl methacrylate, ethyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, and 2-ethyl hexyl<br>
acrylate. Suitable other copolymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monomers include<br>
vinyl aromatic compounds such as styrene and vinyl toluene; nitriles such as<br>
acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile; vinyl and vinylidene halides such as vinyl chloride and<br>
vinylidene fluoride and vinyl esters such as vinyl acetate.<br>
[0041] The acrylic copolymer may include hydroxyl functional groups, which are<br>
often incorporated into the polymer by including one or more hydroxyl functional<br>
monomers in the reactants used to produce the copolymer. Useful hydroxyl functional<br>
monomers include hydroxyalkyl acrylates and methacrylates, typically having 2 to 4<br>
carbon atoms in the hydroxyalkyl group, such as hydroxyethyl acrylate, hydroxypropyl<br>
acrylate, 4-hydroxybutyl acrylate, hydroxy functional adducts of caprolactone and<br>
hydroxyalkyl acrylates, and corresponding methacrylates, as well as the beta-hydroxy<br>
ester functional monomers described below.<br>
[0042] Beta-hydroxy ester functional monomers can be prepared, for example,<br>
from ethylenically unsaturated, epoxy functional monomers and carboxylic acids having<br>
from 13 to 20 carbon atoms, or from ethylenically unsaturated acid functional monomers<br>
and epoxy compounds containing at least 5 carbon atoms that are not poiymerizabfe<br>
with the ethylenically unsaturated acid functional monomer.<br>
[0043] Useful ethylenically unsaturated, epoxy functional monomers used to<br>
prepare the beta-hydroxy ester functional monomers include, but are not limited to,<br>
glycidyl acrylate, glycidyl methacrylate, allyl glycidyl ether, methallyl glycidyl ether, 1:1<br>
(molar) adducts of ethylenically unsaturated monoisocyanates with hydroxy functional<br>
monoepoxides such as glycidol, and glycidyl esters of polymerizable polycarbQxylic<br>
acids such as maleic acid. Glycidyl acrylate and glycidyl methacrylate are particularly<br>
suitable. Examples of carboxylic acids include, but are not limited to, saturated<br>
monocarboxylic acids such as isostearic acid and aromatic unsaturated carboxylic<br>
acids.<br>
[0044] Useful ethylenically unsaturated acid functional monomers used to<br>
prepare the beta-hydroxy ester functional monomers include monocarboxylic acids such<br>
as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, crotonic acid; dicarboxylic acids such as itaconic acid,<br>
maleic acid and fumaric acid; and monoesters of dicarboxylic acids such as monobutyl<br>
maleate and monobutyl i tacon ate. The ethylenically unsaturated acid functional<br>
monomer and epoxy compound are typically reacted in a 1:1 equivalent ratio. The<br>
epoxy compound does not contain ethylenic unsaturation that would participate in free<br>
radical-initiated polymerization with the unsaturated acid functional monomer. Useful<br>
epoxy compounds include 1 ,2-pentene oxide, styrene oxide and glycidyl esters or<br>
ethers, such as those containing from 8 to 30 carbon atoms, such as butyl glycidyl<br>
ether, octyl glycidyl ether, phenyl glycidyl ether and para-(tertiary butyl) phenyl glycidyl<br>
ether. Suitable glycidyl esters include those of the structure:<br>
(Structure Removed) <br>
where R is a hydrocarbon radical containing from 4 to 26 carbon atoms. R can be a<br>
branched hydrocarbon group having from 8 to 10 carbon atoms, such as<br>
neopentanoate, neoheptanoate or neodecanoate. Suitable glycidyl esters of carboxylic<br>
acids include VERSATIC ACID 911 and CARDURA E, each of which is commercially<br>
available from Shell Chemical Co.<br>
 [0045] A polyester polymer may be used in the topcoat composition. Such<br>
polymers may be prepared in a known manner by condensation of a polyhydric alcohol<br>
and a polycarboxylic acid. Suitable polyhydric alcohols include, but are not limited to,<br>
ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butylene glycol, 1 ,6-hexylene glycol, neopentyl glycol,<br>
diethylene glycol, glycerol, trimethylol propane, and pentaerythritol. Suitable<br>
polycarboxylic acids include, but are not limited to, succinic acid, adipic acid, azelaic<br>
acid, sebacic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, phthalic acid, tetrahydrophthalic acid,<br>
hexahydrophthalic acid, and trimellitic acid. Besides the polycarboxylic acids mentioned<br>
above, functional equivalents of the acids such as anhydrides where they exist or lower<br>
alkyl esters of the acids such as the methyl esters may be used.<br>
[0046] Polyurethanes can also be used in the topcoat composition. Among the<br>
polyurethanes that can be used are polymeric polyols, which generally are prepared by<br>
reacting a polyester polyol and/or acrylic polyol such as those described herein with a<br>
polyisocyanate such that the OH/NCO equivalent ratio is greater than 1:1 so that free<br>
hydroxyl groups are present in the product. The organic polyisocyanate that is used to<br>
prepare the polyurethane polyol can be an aliphatic or an aromatic polyisocyanate or a<br>
mixture of the two. Diisocyanates are more suitable, although higher polyisocyanates<br>
can be used in place of or in combination with diisocyanates. Examples of suitable<br>
aromatic diisocyanates are 4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate and toluene<br>
diisocyanate. Examples of suitable aliphatic diisocyanates are straight chain aliphatic<br>
diisocyanates such as 1 ;6-hexamethylene diisocyanate. Also, cycloaliphatic<br>
diisocyanates can be employed. Examples include isophorone diisocyanate and 4,4'methylene-<br>
bis-(cyclohexyl isocyanate}. Examples of suitable higher polyisocyanates<br>
are 1 ,2,4-benzene triisocyanate and polymethylene polyphenyl isocyanate. As with the<br>
polyesters, the polyurethanes can be prepared with unreacted carboxylic acid groups,<br>
which upon neutralization with bases such as amines allows for dispersion into aqueous<br>
medium.<br>
[0047] Examples of polyether polyols are polyalkylene ether polyols, which<br>
include those having the following structural formula: (i) (Formula Removed) <br>
where the substituent R1 is hydrogen or lower alkyl containing from 1 to 5 carbon atoms<br>
including mixed substituents, and n is typically from 2 to 6 and m is from 8 to 100 or<br>
higher. Included are poly(oxytetramethylene) glycols, poly(oxytetraethylene) glycols,<br>
poly(oxy-1 ,2-propylene) glycols, and poly(oxy-1 ,2-butylene) glycols.<br>
[0048] Also useful are polyether polyols formed from oxyalkylation of various<br>
polyols, for example, diols such as ethylene glycol, 1,6-hexanediol, Bisphenol A and the<br>
like, or other higher polyols such as trimethylolpropane, pentaerythritol, and the like.<br>
Polyols of higher functionality that can be. utilized as indicated can be made, for<br>
instance, by oxyalkylation of compounds such as sucrose or sorbitol. One commonly<br>
utilized oxyalkylation method is reaction of a polyol with an alkylene oxide, for example,<br>
propylene or ethylene oxide, in the presence of an acidic or basic catalyst. Particular<br>
polyethers include those sold under the names TERATHANE and TERACOL, available<br>
from E. I. Du Pont de Nemours and Company, Inc., and POL YMEG, available from Q 0<br>
Chemicals, Inc., a subsidiary of Great Lakes Chemical Corp.<br>
[0049] When the functional component contains amine functional groups, they<br>
may be monoamines, diamines, triamines or mixtures thereof. The amines also may be<br>
aromatic or aliphatic (e.g., cycloaliphatic). In one embodiment, the amine component<br>
comprises aliphatic amines to provide enhanced durability. The amine typically is<br>
provided as a liquid having a relatively low viscosity (e.g., less than about 100 mPa-s at<br>
25°C). In a particular embodiment, the amine component is based upon mixtures of<br>
primary and secondary amines. For example, if a mixture of primary and secondary<br>
amines is employed, the primary amine can be present in an amount of 20 to 80 percent<br>
by weight or 20 to 50 percent by weight, with the balance being secondary amines.<br>
Page 140f30<br>
[0050] In certain embodiments, the amine-functional component includes at least<br>
one secondary amine present in an amount of 20 to 80 percent by weight or 50 to 80<br>
percent by weight. Suitable secondary amines can include mono-functional acrylate or<br>
methacrylate modified aliphatic polyamines. Examples of suitable aliphatic polyamines<br>
include, without limitation, ethylamine, the isomeric propylamines, butylamines,<br>
pentylamines, hexylamines, cyclohexylamine, ethylene diamine, 1,2-diaminopropane,<br>
1,4-diaminobutane, 1,3-diaminopentane, 1,6-diaminohexane, 2-methyl-1 ,5-pentane<br>
diamine, 2,5-diamino-2,5-dimethylhexane, 2,2,4- and/or 2,4,4-trimethyl-1 ,6-diaminohexane,<br>
1, 11-diaminoundecane, 1, 12-diaminododecane, 1,3- and/or 1,4-cyclohexane<br>
diamine, 1-amino-3,3,5-trimethyl-5-aminomethyl-cyclohexane, 2,4- and/or 2,6-<br>
hexahydrotoluylene diamine, 2,4'- and/or 4,4'-diamino-dicyclohexyl methane and 3,3'dialkyI4,4'-<br>
diamino-dicyclohexyl methanes (such as 3,3'-dimethyl-4,4'-diaminodicyclohexyl<br>
methane and 3,3'-diethyl-4,4'-diamino-dicyclohexyl methane), 2,4- and/or<br>
2,6-diaminotoluene and 2,4'- and/or 4,4'-diaminodiphenyl methane, or mixtures thereof.<br>
[0051] In certain embodiments of the present invention, the secondary amine<br>
includes an aliphatic amine, such as a cycloaliphatic diamine. Such amines are<br>
available commercially from Huntsman Corporation (Houston, TX) under the<br>
designation of JEFFLINK such as JEFFLINK 754. Alternatively, the amine can be<br>
provided as an amine-functional resin. Such an amine-functional resin can be a<br>
relatively low viscosity, amine-functional resin suitable for use in the formulation of high<br>
solids polyurea coatings. While any of a number of different amine-functional resins<br>
may be suitable, in particular embodiments of the invention, the amine-functional resin<br>
comprises an ester of an organic acid, for example, an aspartic ester-based aminefunctional<br>
reactive resin that is compatible with isocyanates; e.g., one that is solventfree,<br>
and/or has a mole ratio of amine-functionality to the ester of no more than 1:1 so<br>
there remains no excess primary amine upon reaction. One example of such<br>
polyaspartic esters is the derivative of diethyl maleate and 1,5-diamino-2-<br>
methylpentane, available commercially from Bayer Corporation of Pittsburgh, PA, under<br>
the trade name DESMOPHEN NH1220. Other suitable compounds containing<br>
aspartate groups may be employed as well. Additionally, the secondary polyamines<br>
can include polyaspartic esters, which can include derivatives of compounds such as<br>
maleic acid, fumaric acid esters, aliphatic polyamines and the like.<br>
[0052] The amine-functional component also may include high molecular weight<br>
primary amines, such as polyoxyalkyleneamines. The polyoxyalkyleneamines can<br>
contain two or more primary amino groups attached to a backbone, derived, for<br>
example, from propylene oxide, ethylene oxide, or a mixture thereof. Examples of such<br>
amines include those available under the designation JEFFAMINE from Huntsman<br>
Corporation. Such amines typically have a molecular weight ranging from 200 to 7500,<br>
such as, without limitation, JEFFAMINE D-230, 0-400, 0-2000, T-403 and T-5000.<br>
[0053] In certain embodiments of the present invention, the topcoat is deposited<br>
from a film-forming composition comprising a fluorinated acrylic polymer. Nonlimiting<br>
examples of suitable fluoropolymers include fluoroethylene-alkyl vinyl ether alternating<br>
copolymers (such as those described in U.S. Patent No. 4,345,057, incorporated by<br>
reference herein in its entirety) available from Asahi Glass Company under the name<br>
LUMIFLON; fluoroaliphatic polymeric esters commercially available from 3M of S1. Paul,<br>
Minnesota under the name FLUORAD; and perfluorinated hydroxyl functional<br>
(meth)acrylate resins.<br>
[0054] The topcoat composition further comprises a curing agent having<br>
isocyanate and/or anhydride functional groups.<br>
[0055] Anhydrides may include any of those known to be useful in the art as<br>
curing agents, for example, maleic anhydride, phthalic anhydride, tetrahydrophthalic<br>
anhydride, hexahydrophthalic anhydride, methylhexahydrophthalic anhydride,<br>
chlorendic anhydride, and the like. Mixtures of anhydrides may also be used.<br>
[0056] When the curing agent comprises isocyanate, it may be a polyisocyanate,<br>
and it may be selected from one or more polyisocyanates such as diisocyanates and<br>
triisocyanates including biurets and isocyanurates. Oiisocyanates include toluene<br>
diisocyanate, 4,4'-methylene-bis(cyclohexyl isocyanate), isophorone diisocyanate, an<br>
isomeric mixture of 2,2,4- and 2,4,4-trirnethyl hexamethylene diisocyanate,<br>
1 ,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate, tetramethyl xylylene diisocyanate and/or<br>
4,4'-diphenylmethylene diisocyanate. Biurets of any suitable diisocyanate including 1,4-<br>
tetramethylene diisocyanate and 1 ,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate may be used. Also,<br>
Page 16 of 30<br>
biurets of cycloaliphatic diisocyanates such as isophorone diisocyanate and 4,4'methylene-<br>
bis-(cyclohexyl isocyanate) can be employed. Examples of suitable aralkyl<br>
diisocyanates from which biurets may be prepared are meta-xylylene diisocyanate and<br>
a,a,a:,a'-tetramethylmeta-xylylene diisocyanate.<br>
[0057] Trifunctional isocyanates may also be used as the curing agent, for<br>
example, trimers of isophorone diisocyanate, triisocyanato nonane, triphenylmethane<br>
trjisocyanate, 1 ,3,5-benzene triisocyanate, 2,4,6-toluene triisocyanate, an adduct of<br>
trimethylol and tetramethyl xylene diisocyanate sold under the name CYTHANE 3160<br>
by CYTEC Industries, and DESMODUR N 3300, which is the isocyanurate of<br>
hexamethylene diisocyanate, available from Bayer Corporation. Specifically used<br>
polyisocyanates are cyclic isocyanates, particularly, isocyanurates of diisocyanates<br>
such as hexamethylene diisocyanate and isophorone diisocyanate.<br>
[0058] The polyisocyanate may also be one of those disclosed above, chain<br>
extended with one or more polyamines and/or polyols using suitable materials and<br>
techniques known to those skilled in the art.<br>
[0059] When the curing agent has isocyanate functional groups and the topcoat<br>
has hydroxyl or amine groups, the amount of isocyanate used is in relative excess to<br>
the hydroxyl and/or amine groups in the topcoat composition. For example, the<br>
equivalent ratio of isocyanate groups in the curing agent to hydroxyl/amine groups is<br>
greater than 1 to 1 (i.e. &gt; 1 :1). Thus isocyanate is in stoichiometric excess. In<br>
particularly suitable embodiments, when the functional component (a) of topcoat (2)<br>
comprises hydroxyl groups, the NCO:OH may be 1.1 to 2.0:1, such as 1.1 to 1.7:1, or<br>
1.3 to 1.7:1, or 1.5 to 1.7:1. In other particularly suitable embodiments, when the<br>
functional component (a) of topcoat (2) comprises amine groups, the NCO:NH may be<br>
1.03 to 1.10:1, such as 1.05 to 1.08:1. Higher isocyanate levels in all of these ratios can<br>
also be used.<br>
[0060] When the functional component (a) in the topcoat composition (2) is a<br>
polyamine, the volume ratio of the isocyanate-functional curing agent to the aminefunctional<br>
component in an impingement mixing device can be typically 1 :1. This 1 :1<br>
volume ratio is selected to ensure proper mixing within a standard impingement mixing<br>
device. One example of a commercially available mixing device is a GUSMER VR-HPage<br>
3000 proportioner fitted with a GUSMER Model GX-7 spray gun. In that device,<br>
pressurized streams of the separate components (functional component and curing<br>
agent) are delivered from two separate chambers of a proportioner and are impacted or<br>
impinged upon each other at high velocity to effectuate an intimate mixing of the two<br>
components to form a polyurea composition, which is coated onto the desired substrate<br>
via the spray gun. During mixing, the components are atomized and impinged on each<br>
other at high pressure. Superior control of the polyurea reaction is achiev~ when the<br>
forces of the component streams are balanced. The mixing forces experienced by the<br>
component streams are determined by the volume of each stream entering the mixing<br>
chamber per unit time and the pressure at which the component streams are delivered.<br>
A 1:1 volume ratio of the components per unit time serves to equalize those forces.<br>
[0061] The ratio of equivalents of isocyanate groups to amine groups may be<br>
selected to control the rate of cure of the polyurea coating composition, thereby<br>
affecting adhesion. It has been found that two-component polyurea compositions<br>
produced in a 1:1 volume ratio have advantages particularly in curing and adhesion<br>
when the ratio of the equivalents of isocyanate groups to amine groups (also known as<br>
the reaction index) is greater than one, such as the ratios described above. The<br>
isocyanate-functional component and the amine-functional component can be selected<br>
from any of the isocyanates (including polyisocyanates) and amines listed above to<br>
provide a reaction index that is greater than one, while maintaining a 1:1 volume ratio<br>
and acceptable performance of the resulting coating.<br>
[0062] Like the film-forming composition used as the first coating layer, the<br>
topcoat composition can include a variety of optional ingredients and/or additives such<br>
as curing catalysts, colorants, reinforcements, thixotropes, accelerators, surfactants,<br>
plasticizers, extenders, stabilizers, corrosion inhibitors, diluents, hindered amine light<br>
stabilizers, UV light absorbers, and antioxidants.<br>
[0063] In certain embodiments of the present invention, the mUlti-layer coating<br>
system further comprises a second topcoat composition applied over at least a portion<br>
of the topcoat composition. In certain embodiments, the second topcoat can be<br>
deposited from a film-forming composition comprising a functional component<br>
containing hydroxyl and/or amine groups as above, and a curing agent having<br>
isocyanate and/or anhydride functional groups as above. The second topcoat may be<br>
the same as or different from the topcoat. In particularly suitable embodiments, the<br>
second topcoat comprises a fluorinated acrylic polymer. In certain other particularly<br>
suitable embodiments, the second topcoat comprises a polyurea or a<br>
polyurealpolyurethane coating, such as those commercially available from PPG<br>
Industries.<br>
[0064] The compositions used in the multi-layer coating system of the present<br>
invention are typically liquid, and may be solventborne or waterborne. Liquid<br>
compositions that are suitable for use in the present invention include liquid resin<br>
systems that are 100 percent solids, liquid resins that are dissolved or dispersed in a<br>
liquid medium, and solid particulate resins that are dispersed in a liquid medium. Liquid<br>
media may be aqueous based or organiC solvent based.<br>
[0065] The curable compositions used in the multi-layer coating system of the<br>
present invention can be prepared in a number of ways, including as a one-package<br>
composition with a latent curing agent, curable at elevated temperatures including what<br>
are conventionally known as "low-bake" temperatures. Alternatively, the curable<br>
compositions used in the mUlti-layer coatin_9 system of the present invention can be<br>
prepared as a two-paCkage composition, typically curable at ambient temperature or<br>
under low-bake conditions. Two-package curable compositions are typically prepared<br>
by combining the ingredients of each package immediately before use, as described<br>
above with respect to the polyamine compositions. A one-paCkage composition can be<br>
prepared in advance of use and stored.<br>
[0066] As noted above, the mUlti-layer coating system is applied to at least a<br>
portion of a composite. A "compOSite" will be generally understood as referring to<br>
engineering materials made from two or more different materials. Typically, the two or<br>
more materials have different, sometimes significantly different, physical and/or<br>
chemical properties. A composite typically has a matrix material and a reinforcement<br>
material; the matrix surrounds and supports the reinforcement. The composites of the<br>
present invention typically comprise a polymeric material as the matrix and a fiber as<br>
the reinforcement. The fiber can comprise, for example, glass fibers (Le. fiberg,lass),<br>
carbon fibers, aramid fibers, Kevlar fibers, fibers made from natural materials, and fibers<br>
made from nanoparticles. Suitable polymeric material can be thermoplastic or<br>
thermoset and includes, for example, polyester and epoxy. Typically, at least one of the<br>
fibers will be coated with or embedded in, at least in part, the polymeric material. A<br>
particular example includes fiber-reinforced composite materials, such as reinforced<br>
fiberglass composites, which are particularly suitable for wind blade construction. Fiber<br>
reinforced polymers, such as plastics, are also within the scope of "composites" as that<br>
term is used herein. A composite substrate according to the present invention may<br>
have one continuous surface, two or more surfaces such as two opposing surfaces, or<br>
any other configuration. In a particular embodiment, the substrate is a composite in the<br>
form of a wind blade.<br>
[0067] Before depositing any coating compositions upon the surface of the<br>
composite, it may be desired to remove foreign matter from the surface by thoroughly<br>
cleaning and, if relevant, degreasing the surface. Such cleaning typically takes place<br>
after forming the substrate (by molding, for example) into an end-use shape. The<br>
surface of the substrate can be cleaned by physical or chemical means, or both, such<br>
as mechanically abrading the surface or cleaning/degreasing with commercially<br>
available alkaline or acidic cleaning agents are well known to those skilled in the art,<br>
such as sodium metasilicate and sodium hydroxide. A non-limiting example of a<br>
cleaning agent is CHEMKLEEN 163, an alkaline-based cleaner commercially available<br>
from PPG Industries, Inc. Other cleaners, such as those suitable for cleaning fiberglass<br>
composites or plastic materials, could also be used.<br>
[0068] Following the cleaning step, the substrate may be rinsed with deionized<br>
water or an aqueous solution of rinsing agents in order to remove any residue. The<br>
substrate can be air dried, for example, by using an air knife, by flashing off the water by<br>
brief exposure of the substrate to a high temperature or by passing the substrate<br>
between squeegee rolls. In order to optimize surface readiness (smoothness), putty<br>
may be applied to fill surface defects. Any putty compositions known to be useful in the<br>
fields of aerospace and automotive substrate preparation or repair and coatings are<br>
suitable for use. Putty is typically applied by hand with a blade and sanded to achieve<br>
an acceptably smooth surface. An air knife can also be used to remove the residue<br>
from sanding.<br>
 [0069] The compositions may be applied to the composite by one or more of a<br>
number of methods including spraying, rolling, curtain coating, dippinglimmersion,<br>
brushing, or flow coating, but they are most often applied by spraying. The usual spray<br>
techniques and equipment for air spraying and electrostatic spraying and either manual<br>
or automatic methods can be used. The first coating layer typically has a dry film<br>
thickness of 2-25 mils, often 5-25 mils.<br>
[0070] After forming a film of the first coating layer on .the substrate, the first<br>
coating layer can be cured or alternatively given a drying step in which solvent is driven<br>
out of the coating film by heating or an air drying period before application of the<br>
topcoat. Suitable drying conditions may depend, for example, on the particular coating<br>
composition, and on the ambient temperature and humidity.<br>
[0071] The topcoat may be applied to the first coating layer using any of the<br>
methods described above and allowed to cure. The topcoat may be applied to the first<br>
coating layer wet-on-wet, or the first coating layer may be dried and/or cured prior to<br>
application of the topcoat. The dry film thickness of the topcoat may be, for example,<br>
1.0 - 25 mils, such as 4 - 15 mils.<br>
[0072] In certain embodiments of the present invention, a "tie coat" may be<br>
applied between the first coating layer and the topcoat. A tie coat will be understood as<br>
referring to a coating layer between two other coating layers, such as a top layer and<br>
bottom layer, that facilitates removal of the top layer. For example, in repair of the<br>
coating layers on a substrate, it may be desired to remove an old topcoat, such as one<br>
that has become aged and perhaps damaged by environmental or other external forces;<br>
the old topcoat can be replaced by a new topcoat. In such processes, however, it is<br>
often desirable to retain the bottom layer, such as a primer layer, putty layer, and the<br>
like. Removal of such layer might lead to damage of the substrate, or replacement of<br>
the layer may be unnecessary and/or too labor intensive. Use of a tie coat facilitates<br>
such repair by allowing relatively easy removal of the top layer without disturbing the<br>
bottom layer. Examples of suit;:lble tie coats include any known to be useful as<br>
industrial tie coats, particularly those in the aerospace industry.<br>
[0073] lil certain embodiments of the present invention, the composite comprising<br>
the coating 1ayer and a topcoat further comprises a second topcoat composition applied<br>
over at least a portion of the topcoat composition as described above. In a particular<br>
embodiment, when the composite is in the form of a wind blade, the second topcoat<br>
composition may be applied to the leading edge of the wind blade. The second topcoat<br>
may be applied using any of the application methods disclosed above. It will be<br>
appreciated that application of any of the coatings described herein is distinct from tape<br>
or appliques sold for this purpose. The present methods may offer advantages in<br>
application and/or durability as compared to tape/appliques.<br>
[0074] In certain other embodiments of the present invention, the composite has<br>
applied thereto a gel coat. The gel coats can comprise, for example, epoxy resin,<br>
polyester resin or any other suitable material. Gel coats are often applied to composite<br>
material, such as fiber reinforced composites, to provide a higher quality finish to the<br>
composite surface. The composite having the gel coat layer can be further coated<br>
according to the present invention by application of any combination of the coatings<br>
described herein. For example, in certain embodiments, use of a first coating layer<br>
deposited from a primer composition can be used. Any of the topcoats and/or second<br>
topcoats described herein can also be applied, either with or without the primer layer.<br>
Such application can be to all or part of the composite, or any combination thereof.<br>
[0075] The compositions described herein can be cured by any appropriate<br>
means, such as by allowing them to stand at ambient temperature, or a combination of<br>
ambient temperature cure and baking, or by baking alone. The compositions can be<br>
cured at ambient temperature typically in a period ranging from 24 hours to 36 hours. If<br>
ambient temperature and baking are utilized in combination, the composition is typically<br>
allowed to stand for a period of from 10 minutes to 24 hours followed by baking at a<br>
temperature up to 1401= (60OC), for a period of time ranging from 20 minutes to 1 hour.<br>
Alternatively, curing by exposure to infrared (IR) radiation for a time sufficient to effect<br>
cure of the functional groups is also suitable.<br>
[0076] After application of the mUlti-layer coating system of the present invention<br>
to a composite substrate and upon curing, the coated substrate often demonstrates a<br>
60° gloss less than 50. Moreover, the coated substrate demonstrates a rain erosion<br>
resistance rating of at least 1, such as at least 3, at least 5 or higher than 5, as<br>
determined by the RAIN EROSION RESlSTANCE TEST METHOD described in the<br>
examples below.<br>
[0077] The present invention is further directed to a method for repairing a wind<br>
blade, comprising applying to at least a portion of a wind blade any of the coatings<br>
described above, alone or in combination. The coatings can be applied to substantially<br>
all of the wind blade and in other embodiments they can be applied to the leading edge<br>
of the.wind blade. In certain embodiments, one or more of the topcoats as described<br>
above can be applied to at least a portion of the wind blade. The wind blade repaired in<br>
this manner can have a pre-existing coating or coating layers, some or all of which may<br>
be removed prior to application of the topcoat. Alternatively, the newly added topcoat<br>
could be painted over the existing coating and would be a "second" topcoat. In this<br>
embodiment, a tie coat or other adhesion-promoting layer may be applied to the existing<br>
coating. One or more coatings can also be applied to just the leading edge;<br>
alternatively, one or more coatings can be applied to substantially all of the wind blade<br>
and one or more coatings applied to just the leading edge.<br>
[0078] The following examples are intended to illustrate various embodiments of<br>
the invention, and should not be construed as limiting the invention in any way.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
[0079] The RAIN EROSION RESISTANCE TEST METHOD was performed as<br>
follows. Coatings were applied to sanded air foil test coupons. Test coupons were<br>
attached to a whirling arm apparatus. Samples were exposed to 3 inches per hour<br>
water spray that had a droplet size on the order of 1-4 mm. The whirling arm rotational<br>
velocity was approximately 350 mph. Testing occurred in intervals of 15 minutes. A<br>
rating scale of 0 to 15 was used for evaluating performance, in other words, time to fail.<br>
Failure is defined as the time where coating loss is first observed. If failure occurred<br>
before 15 minutes, the rating was "0". The higher the rating the better the rain erosion<br>
performance. The scale is defined below.<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
 [0080] Coatings were reduced to a spraya~e viscosity utilizing solvents<br>
recommended in the product data sheets of the respective coatings. Test foils of<br>
aluminum and/or epoxy filled fiberglass were used, as indicated below. The test foils<br>
were prepared by cleaning with a degreasing solution, OX 330, available from PPG<br>
Industries. The solution was used to wet a cloth or paper towel, and the cloth was used<br>
to wipe the exterior surface of the foil. The foil was allowed to dry in ambient conditions<br>
for 5-10 minutes. The primer coating laye~ was applied using hand held HVLP spray<br>
guns to a dry film build of 4-8 mils. The primer layer was allowed to dry at ambient<br>
conditions for 20-30 minutes. The topcoat layers were then applied to the foils using<br>
similar spray equipment, to a dry film build of 3-10 mils, and allowed to flash for 10-15<br>
minutes. If a leading edge coating was utilized, it was applied next, using similar<br>
equipment. The leading edge coating was applied only to the rounded surface of the<br>
foil (the leading edge). The completed foil was then allowed to flash dry for 10-15<br>
minutes, then cured at ambient conditions for a period of 7 days prior to testing.<br>
