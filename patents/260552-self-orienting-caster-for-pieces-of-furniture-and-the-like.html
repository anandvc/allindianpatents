SELF-ORIENTING CASTER FOR PIECES OF FURNITURE AND THE<br>
LIKE<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a self-orienting caster for pieces of<br>
furniture and the like.<br>
Background Art<br>
Self-orienting casters are known, particularly of the so-called twin<br>
type, which are constituted by two wheels that are mounted so they can<br>
rotate about a horizontal shaft. The. shaft is supported in a seat formed in a<br>
supporting structure that is arranged between the wheels.<br>
In the supporting structure there is a vertical cylindrical recess, which<br>
is open upward, is axially offset with respect to the shaft, and acts as a<br>
rotation seat for a vertical pivot for the spontaneous orientation (pivoting) of<br>
the wheel, which is intended to be inserted and retained in a receptacle of<br>
the piece of furniture on which the caster is to be fitted.<br>
Self-orienting casters are also known in which the wheels can rotate<br>
about a tubular shaft that protrudes on opposite sides of the central<br>
supporting structure. Casters of this type, also known as hubless casters, are<br>
disclosed in US-978,161, in US publication 2002/01758539, in British<br>
patent 967,915, and in German publication 101 28 099. Swiss patent<br>
477,999, British patent 967,915 and US publication 2002/1178539 describe<br>
solutions in which the wheels and the tubular shaft are provided with<br>
mutually opposite tracks for the rolling of balls or rollers for rotatably<br>
supporting the wheels. Known casters have drawbacks as regards the<br>
structure composed of the central support and the tubular shaft, which is<br>
unable to combine satisfactorily mechanical strength characteristics, in<br>
order to be able to withstand the loads, with the need to obtain a product<br>
which, as it is intended for pieces of furniture (chairs, tables, etc.), must<br>
meet appreciable aesthetic requirements.<br><br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The aim of the present invention is to provide a contribution in this<br>
regard, by providing a caster that is capable of meeting these requirements,<br>
is easy and cheap to manufacture and assemble, and offers new aesthetic<br>
standards.<br>
 Within this aim, an object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
caster having a structure suitable to ensure very smooth rolling on surfaces of any kind.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a caster that can<br>
be provided with a braking device that can be neutralized when necessary.<br>
This aim and these and other objects that will become better apparent<br>
hereinafter are achieved with a self-orienting caster for pieces of furniture<br>
and the like, the characteristics of which are defined in the appended claims.<br>

Ways of carrying out the Invention<br>
With reference to Figures 1-4, the reference numeral 1 generally<br>
designates a self-orienting caster of the so-called twin type, particularly for<br>
pieces of furniture. The caster comprises a body 2 that has a substantially<br>
ring-like structure reinforced by radial ridges. The body 2 is provided with a<br>
peripheral expansion 3 in which there is a cylindrical recess 4, which is<br>
tangent to the body 2.<br>
The body 2 is provided with a through seat 5 that has a circular cross-<br>
section and through which a tubular element or sleeve 6 is arranged; such<br>
element comprises two cylindrical portions 7, 8, which protrude coaxially in<br>
a cantilever fashion from opposite sides of the body 2. The portions 7, 8 are<br>
aligned along a horizontal axis A, which is axially offset and perpendicular<br>
with respect to the vertical axis B of the recess 4, and enclose a cylindrical<br>
cavity 9, which passes through the body 2.<br>
The sleeve 6 is provided with a collar 10 (Figure 5), which lies<br>
around the central region and is composed of two annular ridges 11, 12,<br>
between which a channel 13 is formed. The ridges 11, 12, in diametrically<br>
opposite positions, are rounded and form two flat surfaces 14, 15, which are<br>
tangent to the cylindrical surface of the sleeve 6. An annular ridge 16 and<br>
two diametrically opposite flat surfaces 17, 18, arranged on planes that are<br>
parallel to the axis B, are provided within the seat 5 of the body 2. The<br><br>
diameters of the seat 5 and of the ridges 11, 12, as well as the dimensions of<br>
the flat surfaces 17, 18 and the width of the channel 13 and of the annular<br>
protrusion 16 are chosen so as to allow the sleeve 6 to be inserted by forcing<br>
in the seat 5, thus providing an axial connection of the sleeve 6 to the body.<br>
2 by way of the engagement of the annular protrusion 16 in the channel 13.<br>
At the same time, rotary locking is provided by side-fit engagement between<br>
the flat regions 14, 15 and 17, 18.<br>
The forcing action can be facilitated by acting on the configuration of<br>
the annular ridges 11, 12 and by resorting to a suitable choice of the<br>
materials for the sleeve 6 and the body 2. Advantageously, the sleeve 6 is<br>
made of plastic material, whereas for the body 2 it is possible to use plastic<br>
material and metal, for example a metallic alloy of zinc, aluminum and<br>
magnesium, known by the tradename ZAMA, depending on the load<br>
stresses to which the caster is subjected.<br>
Respective annular slots 19, 20 are formed in the tubular portions 7,<br>
8, proximate to their free ends, and form respective annular lips 21, 22,<br>
which are folded outward.<br>
Two wheels 25, 26 are fitted rotatably on the tubular portions 7,8<br>
(Figure 3) by way of the interposition of bearings 23, 24. The bearings 23, 24 are of the rolling type and are constituted by rollers 27 inserted in<br>
receptacles 28 of an annular cage 29. The rollers 27 have a diameter that is<br>
larger than the radial thickness of the cage 29, so that they protrude toward<br>
the inside and the outside of the receptacles 28 and can roll on the opposite<br>
cylindrical tracks 30, 31 of the tubular portions 7, 8 and respectively 32, 33<br>
of the wheels 25,26.	<br>
The wheels 25, 26 have, on the side that faces the body 2, respective<br>
grooves 34, 35 and, on the opposite side, respective internal collars 36, 37.<br>
The internal collars 36, 37 are sized so as to engage by elastic forcing in the<br>
slots 19, 20 of the sleeve 6 and therefore retain axially thereon the wheels<br>
25, 26 with minimal friction. At the same time, two annular ridges 38, 39<br><br>
engage in the grooves 34, 35, protrude frontally from the lateral faces of the<br>
body 2 and surround the seat 5, forming a sort of labyrinth-like coupling<br>
that prevents foreign particles and dirt from penetrating toward the bearings<br>
23, 24 and compromising their correct operation.<br>
The caster is fitted to the piece of furniture by means of a pivot 40,<br>
which can rotate in a bush 41 (Figures 2 and 4), which acts as an antifriction<br>
bearing for the rotation of the caster about the pivot 40. The bush 41 is<br>
shaped like a bushing that has a stud 42 that protrudes from the bottom and<br>
an internal collar 43. The stud 42 acts as a resting point for the pivot 40 on<br>
the caster 1, while the internal collar 43 is used to retain the pivot 40 within<br>
the bushing 41 after it has been forced to engage in an annular groove 44 of<br>
said pivot.<br>
In order to retain the bush 41 in the recess 4, the inlet of the recess is<br>
formed by a protruding rim, which has a groove 45 that divides it into two<br>
mutually concentric lips 46, 47. The inner annular lip 46 is suitable to be<br>
folded onto the rim of the bush 41, so as to lock it axially in the recess.<br>
Advantageously, the outer rim of the bush 41 is rounded in order to allow<br>
the internal lip 46 to be folded over onto it and ensure more effective axial<br>
retention of the bush. Likewise, the outer annular lip 47 is folded outward so<br>
as to lock any optional ring-like element 48 that is applied so as to cover the<br>
expansion 3 and is shaped so as to mate with the contour of the body 2.<br>
During use, the described caster 1 behaves like a known twin caster,<br>
but with the considerable advantage that the sleeve 6, by way of its radial<br>
dimensions, provides the caster with the rigidity required to withstand<br>
effectively load imbalances on the. two wheels and facilitate their smooth<br>
rotation. Further, the hollow structure of the sleeve 6 does not encumber,<br>
also from an aesthetic standpoint, the caster, whose appearance maintains<br>
the requirements of lightness even in the case of large casters.<br>
It should be noted that the bush 41 may be omitted. In this<br>
embodiment, shown in Figure 6, the pivot 40 of the caster 1 rests directly on<br><br>
the bottom of the recess 4 with the interposition of a ball 49. The covering<br>
element 48 is locked by providing, around the rim of the inlet of the recess<br>
4, an annular lip 50 suitable to engage in a groove 51 formed inside the ring<br>
52 of the element 48.<br>
Figures 7, 8, 9 and 10 illustrate another embodiment, which relates to a twin caster provided with a self-braking device that ensures wheel locking<br>
when the caster is not loaded, for example as required by safety standards if<br>
the caster is used in office chairs..<br>
 In the caster of Figures 7-10, the seat 5 is formed by two substantially<br>
semicylindrical portions 53, 54, which have a radius that is equal to the<br>
radius of the portions 7,8 of the sleeve 6 but are mutually spaced so that the<br>
seat 5 is ovalized. The adjacent ends of the portions 53, 54 are connected by<br>
the two opposite flat surfaces 17, 18, which as mentioned have a mutual<br>
distance that is equal to the distance between the flat surfaces 14, 15 of the<br>
sleeve 6. The ridges 38, 39 also are constituted by semicylindrical portions<br>
that are concentric with respect to the respective portions 53, 54. The<br>
ovalization of the seat 5 allows to insert therein the sleeve 6 so that the flat surfaces 14, 15 are in sliding contact with the flat surfaces 17, 18 of the body 2, allowing the sleeve 6 to perform vertical movements within the seat<br>
5 while remaining rotationally coupled to the body 2 and being retained<br>
axially by the engagement of the annular protrusion 16 in the channel 13.<br>
A through hole 5 is provided centrally through the lower<br>
semicylindrical portion 53 and is aligned vertically with a blind seat 56<br>
formed in the upper semicylindrical portion 54. A spring 57 is inserted in<br>
the blind seat 56, before the sleeve 6 is positioned in the seat 5, and acts on<br>
said sleeve, when said sleeve is inserted, so as to push it towards the lower<br>
portion 53.	<br>
The spring 57, once the caster 1 has been fitted to the chair, allows<br>
the body 2 to move with respect to the sleeve 42. In particular, the spring 57<br>
is sized as so as to lift the body 2 with respect to the sleeve 6 when the<br><br>
caster is not loaded and instead allow its lowering when the caster 1 is<br>
loaded. In the first manner of use (for example, when the caster 1 is<br>
mounted on an office chair on which no one is sitting), locking of the caster<br>
is provided by way of the friction effect obtained by means of the contact of<br>
sliding blocks 58, 59, which are constituted by protrusions formed above the<br>
top of the ridges 38, 39, against the walls of the grooves 34, 35 of the<br>
wheels 25, 26 in which the ridges 38, 39 are engaged. In the second manner<br>
of use, i.e., when the caster is loaded (for example when a person is sitting<br>
on the chair), the ridges 38, 39 are perfectly free in the grooves 34, 35,<br>
allowing the free gliding of the chair.<br>
The spring 57 may also act as a shock absorber. In this case, the<br>
. sliding blocks 58, 59 are omitted in order to avoid a braking effect.<br>
The caster of Figures 7-10 can be modified easily in order to make it<br>
able to glide freely or glide with friction when necessary. For this purpose,<br>
the lower through hole 55 is threaded in order to receive an adjustment<br>
screw 60, which is suitable to act on the sleeve 6. Actuation of the screw 60<br>
allows the sleeve 6 to be raised so as to move the sliding blocks 58 of the<br>
ridges 38, 39 into friction-controlled or free engagement against the walls of<br>
the grooves 34, 35.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Figure 11, the partitions 61 of the<br>
bearings 23, 24 that mutually separate the receptacles of the rollers 27 have<br>
ends that are divided by respective radial slits 62, which form two flexible<br>
prongs 63. The prongs 63 are provided with teeth 64, which narrow the<br>
access of the rollers 27 in the receptacles 28. The prongs 63, by way of their<br>
flexibility, allow the insertion of the rollers in the receptacles and their<br>
retention by means of the teeth 64.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Figure 12, roller retention is provided by<br>
providing a ring 65, which is associated with the cage 29 by means of an<br>
annular flange 66 that protrudes from one of its faces and engages slits 67<br>
formed in the ends of the partitions 61.<br><br>
In another embodiment, a metal strip is applied, is connected to the<br>
metal body 2 and is in sliding contact with the rolling surface of the casters<br>
in order to discharge any electrostatic charges to the ground.<br>
