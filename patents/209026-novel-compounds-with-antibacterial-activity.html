TITLE OF INVENTION<br>
NOVEL COMPOUNDS WITH- ANTIBACTERIAL ACTIVITY<br><br>
APPLICANT(S)	<br>
a) Name	: MORPHOCHEM AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT FUR<br>
	KOMBINATORISCHE CHEMIE<br>

PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br><br>
Novel compounds having anti-bacterial activity<br><br>
Resistance to the antibiotics used currently has increased appreciably in many countries of the world in recent years and in some cases has assumed alarming proportions. The main problem is that those pathogens exhibit not just a single resistance but, as a rule, multiple resistance. This is true especially of some gram-positive pathogen groups, such as staphylococci, pneumococci and enterococci (S. Ewig et a/.; Antibiotika-Resistenz bei Erregern ambulant erworbener Atemwegsinfektionen (Antibiotic resistance in pathogens of outpatient-acquired respiratory tract infections); Chemother. J. 2002, 11, 12-26; F. Tenover; Development and spread of bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents: an overview; Clin. Infect. Dis. 2001 Sep 15, 33 Suppl. 3,108-115)<br>
A long-feared development has recently occurred: In the USA, the first strain of Staphylococcus aureus has been described that is not only resistant to methicillin but also highly resistant to vancomycin (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Staphylococcus aureus resistant to vancomycin - United States, 2002; MMWR 2002, 51, 565-567). In addition to hygiene measures in hospitals, therefore, increased efforts are also required to find new antibiotics that as far as possible have a novel structure and a novel mechanism of action so as to be effective against those problem bacteria.<br>
The present invention describes new kinds of compounds having anti-bacterial activity.<br>
The present invention relates to compounds of the general formula (I):<br><br>

The therapeutic use of compounds of formula (I), their pharmacologically acceptable salts or solvates and hydrates and also formulations and pharmaceutical compositions also lie within the scope of the present invention.<br>
The pharmaceutically compositions according to the present invention comprise at least one compound of formula (I) as active ingredient and, optionally, carrier substances and/or adjuvants.<br>
Examples of pharmacologically acceptable salts of the compounds of formula (I) are salts of physiologically acceptable mineral acids, such as hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid and phosphoric acid, and salts of organic acids, such as methanesulphonic acid, p-toluenesulphonic acid, lactic acid, acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, citric acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid and salicylic acid. Further examples of pharmacologically acceptable salts of the compounds of formula (I) are alkali metal and alkaline earth metal salts such as, for example, sodium, potassium, lithium, calcium and magnesium salts, ammonium salts and salts of organic bases such as, for example, methylamine, dimethylamine, triethylamine, piperidine, ethylenediamine, lysine, choline hydroxide, meglumine, morpholine and arginine salts. Compounds of formula (I) can be solvated, especially hydrated. The hydration may take place, for example, during the preparation process or as a consequence of the hygroscopic nature of the initially anhydrous compounds of formula (I). When the compounds of formula (I) comprise asymmetric carbon atoms, they may be either in the form of achiral compounds, diastereoisomeric mixtures, mixtures of enantiomers or in the form of optically pure compounds.<br>
The pro-drugs to which the present invention also relates consist of a compound of formula (I) and at least one pharmacologically acceptable protecting group that is removed under physiological conditions, for example an alkoxy, aralkyloxy, acyl or acyloxy group, such as, for example, an ethoxy, daloxate, benzyloxy, acetyl or acetyloxy group or a group of formula COOCH20COC(CH3)3 or COOCH2OCOO-cyclohexyl.<br>
The present invention relates also to the use of those active ingredients in the preparation of medicaments.  In general,<br>
7<br><br>
compounds of formula (I) are administered either individually, or in combination with any other desired therapeutic agent, using the known and acceptable methods. Such therapeutically useful agents may be administered, for example, by one of the following routes: orally, for example in the form of dragees, coated tablets, pills, semi-solid substances, soft or hard capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions; parenterally, for example in the form of an injectable solution; rectally in the form of suppositories; by inhalation, for example in the form of a powder formulation or spray, transdermally or intranasally. For the preparation of such tablets, pills, semi-solid substances, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatin capsules, the therapeutically usable product can be mixed with pharmacologically inert, inorganic or organic pharmaceutical carrier substances, for example with lactose, sucrose, glucose, gelatin, malt, silica gel, starch or derivatives thereof, talcum, stearic acid or salts thereof, skimmed milk powder and the like. For the preparation of soft capsules, pharmaceutical earner substances such as, for example, vegetable oils, petroleum, animal or synthetic oils, wax, fat and polyols can be used. For the preparation of liquid solutions and syrups, pharmaceutical carrier substances such as, for example, water, alcohols, aqueous saline solution, aqueous dextrose, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oils, petroleum and animal or synthetic oils can be used. For suppositories, pharmaceutical carrier substances such as, for example, vegetable oils, petroleum, animal or synthetic oils, wax, fat and polyols can be used. For aerosol formulations, compressed gases that are suitable for the purpose can be used, such as, for example, oxygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide. The pharmaceutically acceptable agents may also comprise additives for preserving and stabilising, emulsifiers, sweeteners, flavourings, salts for altering the osmotic pressure, buffers, encapsulation additives and anti-oxidants.<br>
Combinations with other therapeutic agents may comprise other antimicrobial and anti-fungal active ingredients.<br>
For the prevention and/or treatment of bacterial infections, the dose of the biologically active compound according to the invention can vary within wide limits and can be adjusted to individual requirements. Generally, a dose of from 10 mg to 4000 mg per day is suitable, apreferred dose being from 50 to 3000 mg per day. In suitable cases, the dose may also be below or above the stated values. The daily dose can be administered as a single dose or in a plurality of doses. A typical individual dose contains approximately 50 mg, 100 mg, 250 mg, 500 mg, 1 g or 2 g of the active ingredient.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1: 2-((3RS)-{[(2,3-Dihydro-benzo[1,4]dioxin-6-yl-methyl)amino]methyl}piperidin-1 -yl)-(1 RS)-(6-methoxyquinolin-4-yljethanol.<br>
1.a) Benzyl (3RS)-azidomethylpiperidine-1 -carbamate:<br><br><br>
At 0°C, triethylamine (5.6 ml, 40.1 mmol) and then methanesulphonyl chloride (2 ml, 25.7 mmol) were added to a solution of benzyl 3-hydroxymethylpiperidine-1 -carbamate (5 g, 20.05 mmol) in dichloromethane (100 ml). After the solution had been stirred for 20 min., the reaction mixture was cooled to -60°C and a solution of benzyl 4-oxopiperidine-1 -carbamate (2.33 g, 10 mmol) in diethyl ether (10 ml) was added. The reaction mixture was heated to room temperature in the course of 30 minutes and water (40 ml) was added. The two phases were separated and the aqueous phase was extracted twice using 50 ml of ethyl acetate each time. The combined organic phases were washed with 20 ml of saturated sodium chloride solution, dried over MgS(\ filtered and concentrated to dryness by rotary evaporation. The residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (EtOAc). The resulting oil was dissolved in DMF (45 ml), and sodium azide (2.6 g, 40 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was further stirred for 3 hours at 80°C and then diluted with water (100 ml) and ethyl acetate (200 ml). The two phases were separated and the aqueous phase was extracted twice using 50 ml of ethyl acetate each time. The combined organic phases were washed with 20 ml of saturated sodium chloride solution, dried over MgS04, filtered and concentrated to dryness by rotary evaporation. The residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (hexane/EtOAc 1/1).<br>
Yield: 6.1 g (18.6 mmol)<br><br>
Benzyl 3-hydroxymethyl-piperidine-1-carbamate has already been described in Arch. Pharm. (Weinheim, Germany) 1990 p. 9-12.<br>
1.b) Benzyl (3RS)-aminomethyl-piperidine-1 -carbamate:<br>
O<br>
Triphenylphosphine (8 g, 30 mmol) was added to a solution of benzyl 3-azidomethylpiperidine-1-carbamate (6.1 g, 18.6 mmol) in THF (37 ml) and water (5 ml). After the solution had been stirred for 3 hours at 60°C, the reaction mixture was concentrated and the residue was taken up in 3N HCI (200 ml) and ether (200 ml). The two phases were separated and the aqueous phase was extracted twice using 100 ml of ethyl acetate each time. Solid sodium hydroxide (16 g, 640 mmol) was cautiously added until an oil separated out. The mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate and the organic phases was dried over MgS04 and filtered, and the filtrate was concentrated to dryness by rotary evaporation.<br>
Yield: 2.81 g, 11.3 mmol<br>
