Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the same, use of said compounds for the manufacture of a medicament for treatment of inter alia shock conditions as well as to a method for treatment of said conditions, wherein said compounds Ere administered. Background<br>
Peptidic vasopressin Via receptor agonists, such as terlipressir., have recently (see e.g. O'Brian et al. , Lancet 359 ; £313):1209-10, June 4th, 2002) received increased attention for clinical use in treatment of critical care diseases and conditions, including shock-of hypovolemic (e.g. hemorrhagic) or vasodilatory (e.g. septic) origin, bleeding esophageal varices (BEV), hepa-torenal syndrome (HRS), cardiopulmonary resuscitation and anesthesia-induced hypotension. They have also beer, shown to have clinical use in the treatment of orthostatic hypotension, paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction, intra-opexative blood loss and blood loss associated with burn debridement and epistaxis, and for treatment of various ocular diseases by increasing lacrimation/tear formation.<br>
In treating critical care conditions it is highly desirable to control the arterial blood pressure, and the drug used is typically administered intravenously.. Continuous intravenous drug infusion at increasing or decreasing rates is a practical means of providing the desired degree of control. The attainment of so-called "steady state" plasma concentrations of drug depends on the elimination half life of the drug infused. It is generally recognised that steady state plasma concentration is achieved after a period of time equivalent to three times the elimination half life of the drug. To be prac-<br><br>
tical in a clinical setting the desired arterial blooci pressure at the steady state should be attained in about two hours, preferably in one hour or less. Via agonists with an elimination half life longer than 1 hour are therefore usually not considered useful for critical care treatment,<br>
A disadvantage of terlipressin in many critical care situations is its long duration of action, which makes it difficult to titrate its effect as the disease state changes. The efficacy of terlipressin at the human Via (hVia) receptor also needs to be improved e.g. to allow lower dosages in general.<br>
Also the compound known as F180 {cf. example 3 in US patent No. 5,459,236) has an inconveniently long duration of action to be considered for the treatment of most critical care conditions.<br>
Non-specific receptor agonist activity is the main disadvantage of other existing compounds, e.g. [Phe2,Orn8jOT (cf. example If in US patent No. 3,352,843) and arginine-vasopressin (AVP). Activity at related receptors such as Vlb, V.2 and oxytocin (OT) receptors may potentially generate undesirable side effects and safety concerns. As an example, V2 receptor activation may induce antidiuresis (cf. desmopressrn), release of coagulation/thromboly sis factors, and induce vasodilation/hypo-tension with reflex tachycardia. The latter side effect may also be induced by OT receptor agonist activity.<br>
It is an objective of the present invention to provide compounds that are especially useful in the treatment of critical care conditions.<br>

Experimental (synthesis)<br>
Amino acid derivatives and resins were purchased from commercial providers (Novabiochem, Bachem Peptide International and PepTech Corporation). Fmoc-Hgn-OH was synthesised according to literature (Wisniewski, K., Kolodziejczyk, A..S, Org.. Prep. P-roced. Int.. 1997, 29, 338-341). Other chemicals and solvents were provided from Sigma-Aldrich, Fisher Scientific and VWR.<br>
The compounds herein were synthesised by standard methods in solid phase peptide chemistry utilising both Fmoc and Boc methodology.. Unless otherwise provided, all reactions were performed at room temperature. In addition to the references cited supra, the following standard reference literature provides further guidance on general experimental set up, as well as on the availability of required starting material and reagents;:<br><br>

Merrifield, J, Am. Chem, Soc. 1963, 85, 2149-2154.<br>
Purity of the synthesized peptide may be determined by analytical reversed phase HPLC. Structural integrity of the peptides may be confirmed using amino acid analysis and electrospray mass spectrometry.<br>
The peptides synthesised by Fmoc methodology were cleaved with a TFA/TIS/H20 96/2/2 (v/v/v) solution, and cleavage in Boc methodology was accomplished with 90% HF/10% aniscle (v/v) solution. Disulfide bridge (ring) formation was achieved by oxidation of linear peptides dissolved in 10% TFA (aq) with iodine. Peptides were purified by preparative H?LC in triethylammonium phosphate buffers (aq}. The compounds were finally converted to acetate salts using conventional HPLC methodology. The fractions with a purity exceeding 97% were pooled and lyophilised.<br>
Synthesis of peptides with alkylated side chain in position no, 8:<br>
The peptides were assembled with Fmoc methodology. The diamrno acid residue in position no, 8 was introduced with an acid labile (i.e. removable with a solution containing 1-2% TFA) protecting group, such as methoxy-trityl (Mmt; see Barlos, K. et al. in Peptides 1992, Schneider, C.H., Eberle, A.N., Eds., ESCOM Science Publishers 3-V.r 1993, pp 263-284). Resin bound peptide was treated with a DCM/TIS/TFA 93/5/2 (v/v/v) solution for the Mmt group removal. Reductive alkylation with acetone/NaBH(OAc)s provided the W-isopropyl peptide.<br>
To avoid undesirable N,N-d±alkylation in reductive alkylation in the above procedure, which .may occur when<br><br>
straight chain alkyl aldehydes are used, an alternative was developed, wherein after the Mmt removal the amino group was first derivatised with 2-nitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride (o-NBS-Cl; see Fukuyama, T.; Jow, C.-K.; Cheung, N. Tetrahedron Lett. 1995, 36, 6373-6374). The resulting sulphonamide was then alkylated with an appropriate alcohol under conventional Mitsunobu reaction conditions, typically utilising TPP/DIAD in 1,2-dimethoxyethane (Mitsunobu, 0. Synthesis 1981, 1-2-8) . The o-NBS-Cl group was subsequently removed with 5% potassium thiophenolate ±r. DMF, after which the peptide was cleaved from the resin.<br>
Synthesis of peptides with Ar-alkylated side chair, in position no. 4:<br>
The peptides were assembled with Boc methodology. The residue in position no. 4 was introduced in the sequence as 3oc-Asp(OFm)-OH. After complete peptide assembly the side chain protection was removed with 30% piperidine in DMF. The resulting free carboxylic group was converted to the desired amide by coupling with an appropriate amine mediated by PyBOP or BOP/DIEA. The K-terminal Boc group was then removed, followed by EF cleavage, cyclisation and purification by HPLC,<br>

Compound 1; [Phe2, Hgn4,0rn (i-Pr)e] VT:<br>
The amino acid derivatives used were Boc-Cys(Trt) -OH, Fmoc-Phe-OH, Fmoc-Ile-OH, Fmoc-Hgn-OH, Fmoc-Asn(Trt)-OK, Fraoc-CysETrt)-OHf Fmoc-Pro-OH, Fmoc-Orn(Mmt)-OH and Fmoc-Gly-OH. Fmoc-Hgn-OH was synthesised as mentioned above. Analytical HPLC was performed on a Waters 600 Liquid Chromatograph using a Vydac C18, 5u 4.6 x 250 mm, column at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Preparative HPLC was performed on a Waters 2000 Liquid Chromatograph using a Prepak 47 x 300 mm cartridge at a flow rate of IOC ml/min, Final compound analysis was performed on a 1100 Agilent Liquid Chromatograph using a Vydac C18r 5ja 2,1 x 250 mm, column at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Mass spectra were recorded on a Finnigan MAT spectrometer.<br>
The fully protected peptide resin was synthesised on an Applied Biosystems 9050 Peptide Synthesiser starting from 2 g (0.5 mmol) of Tentagel-S-RAM resin (Peptides International). DIC/HOBt mediated single couplings with a 4-fold excess of amino acid derivatives were performed. The Fmoc group was removed with 20% piperidine in DMF. Upon completion of the automated synthesis, the resin was transferred into a manual synthesis vessel and was treated with DCM/TIS/TFA 93/5/2 (v/v/v) solution (30 ml) for 2 x 1.5 hours for removal of the Mmt group. The resin was thoroughly washed with DCM and was subsequently<br>
suspended in 15 ml of 1,2-dichloroetehane/TMOF 1:1 (v/v) . 0.2 ml of acetone was then added followed by 0,6 g :;f NaBH(OAc)3. The suspension was shaken overnight and \:he resin was washed with methanol, DMF and DCM and dried in vacua. The resin was then treated with 30 ml of the TFA/TIS/%0 96/2/2 (v/v/v) solution for 1.5 hours and filtered off. The filtrate was evaporated and the crude linear peptide was precipitated with diethyl ether. The precipitate was immediately dissolved in 500 ml of 10% TFA (aq), and the peptide was oxidised by adding 0.1 M T2 in methanol to the magnetically stirred solution unzil yellow color persisted. Excess of iodine was reduced with ascorbic acid. The reaction mixture was then cooled with crushed ice and pH was adjusted to about 5 by'adding concentrated ammonia (aq) . The mixture was loaded onto an HPLC column and purified using a triethylammonium phosphate buffer with pH 5.2. The compound was eluted with a gradient of acetonitrile. The fractions with a purity exceeding 97% were pooled, and the resulting solution was diluted with 2 volumes of water. The solution was reloaded onto the column which was then washed with 2 1 of 0,1 M ammonium acetate (aq) and equilibrated with 2% acetic acid (aq). The compound was eluted with a fast (3%/min) gradient of acetonitrile. The fractions containing the desired product were pooled and lyophillsed.. 168 mg (-30% yield) of white amorphous powder was obtained.

DCC, PyBOP or DIC/HOBt mediated single couplings with 2.5-fold excess of amino acid derivatives were employed. The Boc group was removed with 50% TFA in DCM containing 1% of m-cresol. Upon completion of the synthesis/ the 9-fluoren-ylmethyl ester was removed from the p-carboxylic group of aspartic acid by treatment with 30% piperidine in DKF for 2 x 30 min. The resin was washed with 1 M HOBt in DMF solution for 30 rain and then twice with DMF only. The free carbcxylic group was amidated by overnight trea-ment with 2 mmcl of ethylamine/PyBOP/DIEA in DMF. The finished resin was washed with methanol, DMF and DCM and dried in vacua. The peptide was cleaved from the resin by using 30 ml of anhydrous HF containing 3 ml of anisole at 0°C for 90 minutes. The HF was evaporated off, and the crude linear pep-ide was washed with diethyl ether. The peptide was immediately dissolved in 200 nl of 25% acetonitrile/10% TFA (aq) and oxidised as described supra. The resulting mixture was loaded directly onto an HPLC column and purified using triethylammonium phosphate buffer at pH 2.3. The subsequent purification steps were identical to the procedure for compound 1^ 41 mg (-10% yield) of white amorphous powder was obtained. HPLC: Rt=10.0 min, gradient.: 20-*40% B over 20 min, t=40°C, solvent A 0.01% TFA (aq), solvent B 70% CH3CN, 0.01% TFA (ag) ; Purity: 100%; MS (M-t-H4) : expected 992,5, observed 992.2.<br>

In vritro receptor assays:<br>
Agonist activity of compounds on the hVla receptor was determined in a transcriptional reporter assay by transiently transfecting a hVla receptor expression DNA into HEK-293 cells in concert with a reporter DNA<br>
containing intracellular calcium responsive promoter elements regulating expression of firefly luciferase. See Boss, V., Talpade, D.J., Murphy, T.J. J. Bid. Chem. 1996, May 3; 271(18), 10429-10432 for further guidance on this assay. Cells were exposed to serial dilutions of compounds diluted 10-fold per dose for 5 hours, followed by lysis of cells, determination of luciferace activity, and determination of compound efficacies and ECso values through non-linear regression. Arginine-vasopressin (AVP) was used as an internal control in each experiment, ana compounds were tested in at least three independent experiments. To determine selectivity, compounds were tested in luciferase-based tr&amp;r.scriptional reporter assays expressing the human oxytocin (hOT) receptor. Assays for other receptors (hV2, hVlb, rat Via and rat V2) were also conducted.<br>
For further comparative purposes, other reference compounds used were [?he2,Qrn8]OT, terlipressin and 7180.<br>

The results of the in vitro assays are depicted in table 2 inr"ra. The EC5o value given is the geometric mean expressed in nanomol/L (nM). Selectivity values are given as ECso ratios.<br>
In vivo pharmacological tests:<br>
The compounds were tested in vivo for duration of action related to a standard dose of AVP. Blood pressure tests were carried out on anaesthetised Sprague-Dawley male rats (weighing 270-300 g) with catheterised jugular vein and carotid artery. The catheterised carotid artery<br>
WES used to continuously monitor blood pressure and the jugular vein was used for administration of the compounds tested. Rats received intravenous injections of dibenair.ine prior to dosing to enhance their responsiveness to Via receptor agonists (cf. Dekanski, J., Br. J. Pharmacol. 1952, 1, 567-572). The dosing procedure consisted of one intravenous injection of physiological saline followed by two consecutive injections of a standard dose of AVP (0.1 nmol/kg, * ED7o) , and three to five increasing doses of a giver, compound selected to give at least a response comparable to the standard dose of AVP. Dosing intervals were set as time for the blood pressure to decrease to a stable baseline.<br>
Determination of duration of action was based on the decay rate of diastolic arterial blood pressure transient increase. Specifically, for an exponential decay of plasma concentration, it can be shown that, if the response is measured beyond the distribution phase, the rate of decay near the ECso is linear and inversely proportional to the elimination half-life (Rowland, K. ani Tczer, T. in vClinical Pbzrmacokinetics, Concepts and Applications", 3rd ed., Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, Philadelphia, 1995},<br>
To measure the response decay rate for a given compound, a dose was selected that gave an amplitude of response as similar as possible to the amplitude of response to the second injection of the standard dose of AVP. To normalise for inter-individual variation in Vla-responsiveness, the duration of action was expressed as the ratio of decay rate for this reference AVP response to the decay rate for the eguieffective dose of compound for each rat tested. The results obtained for the compounds tested are set forth in table 2.<br>

cantPEPTIDIC VASOPRESSIN RECEPTOR AGONISTS<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the same, use of said compounds for the manufacture of a medicament for treatment of inter alia shock conditions as well as to a method for treatment of said conditions, wherein said compounds Ere administered. Background<br>
Peptidic vasopressin Via receptor agonists, such as terlipressir., have recently (see e.g. O'Brian et al. , Lancet 359 ; £313):1209-10, June 4th, 2002) received increased attention for clinical use in treatment of critical care diseases and conditions, including shock-of hypovolemic (e.g. hemorrhagic) or vasodilatory (e.g. septic) origin, bleeding esophageal varices (BEV), hepa-torenal syndrome (HRS), cardiopulmonary resuscitation and anesthesia-induced hypotension. They have also beer, shown to have clinical use in the treatment of orthostatic hypotension, paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction, intra-opexative blood loss and blood loss associated with burn debridement and epistaxis, and for treatment of various ocular diseases by increasing lacrimation/tear formation.<br>
In treating critical care conditions it is highly desirable to control the arterial blood pressure, and the drug used is typically administered intravenously.. Continuous intravenous drug infusion at increasing or decreasing rates is a practical means of providing the desired degree of control. The attainment of so-called "steady state" plasma concentrations of drug depends on the elimination half life of the drug infused. It is generally recognised that steady state plasma concentration is achieved after a period of time equivalent to three times the elimination half life of the drug. To be prac-<br><br>
tical in a clinical setting the desired arterial blooci pressure at the steady state should be attained in about two hours, preferably in one hour or less. Via agonists with an elimination half life longer than 1 hour are therefore usually not considered useful for critical care treatment,<br>
A disadvantage of terlipressin in many critical care situations is its long duration of action, which makes it difficult to titrate its effect as the disease state changes. The efficacy of terlipressin at the human Via (hVia) receptor also needs to be improved e.g. to allow lower dosages in general.<br>
Also the compound known as F180 {cf. example 3 in US patent No. 5,459,236) has an inconveniently long duration of action to be considered for the treatment of most critical care conditions.<br>
Non-specific receptor agonist activity is the main disadvantage of other existing compounds, e.g. [Phe2,Orn8jOT (cf. example If in US patent No. 3,352,843) and arginine-vasopressin (AVP). Activity at related receptors such as Vlb, V.2 and oxytocin (OT) receptors may potentially generate undesirable side effects and safety concerns. As an example, V2 receptor activation may induce antidiuresis (cf. desmopressrn), release of coagulation/thromboly sis factors, and induce vasodilation/hypo-tension with reflex tachycardia. The latter side effect may also be induced by OT receptor agonist activity.<br>
It is an objective of the present invention to provide compounds that are especially useful in the treatment of critical care conditions.<br>

Experimental (synthesis)<br>
Amino acid derivatives and resins were purchased from commercial providers (Novabiochem, Bachem Peptide International and PepTech Corporation). Fmoc-Hgn-OH was synthesised according to literature (Wisniewski, K., Kolodziejczyk, A..S, Org.. Prep. P-roced. Int.. 1997, 29, 338-341). Other chemicals and solvents were provided from Sigma-Aldrich, Fisher Scientific and VWR.<br>
The compounds herein were synthesised by standard methods in solid phase peptide chemistry utilising both Fmoc and Boc methodology.. Unless otherwise provided, all reactions were performed at room temperature. In addition to the references cited supra, the following standard reference literature provides further guidance on general experimental set up, as well as on the availability of required starting material and reagents;:<br><br>

Purity of the synthesized peptide may be determined by analytical reversed phase HPLC. Structural integrity of the peptides may be confirmed using amino acid analysis and electrospray mass spectrometry.<br>
The peptides synthesised by Fmoc methodology were cleaved with a TFA/TIS/H20 96/2/2 (v/v/v) solution, and cleavage in Boc methodology was accomplished with 90% HF/10% aniscle (v/v) solution. Disulfide bridge (ring) formation was achieved by oxidation of linear peptides dissolved in 10% TFA (aq) with iodine. Peptides were purified by preparative H?LC in triethylammonium phosphate buffers (aq}. The compounds were finally converted to acetate salts using conventional HPLC methodology. The fractions with a purity exceeding 97% were pooled and lyophilised.<br>
Synthesis of peptides with alkylated side chain in position no, 8:<br>
The peptides were assembled with Fmoc methodology. The diamrno acid residue in position no, 8 was introduced with an acid labile (i.e. removable with a solution containing 1-2% TFA) protecting group, such as methoxy-trityl (Mmt; see Barlos, K. et al. in Peptides 1992, Schneider, C.H., Eberle, A.N., Eds., ESCOM Science Publishers 3-V.r 1993, pp 263-284). Resin bound peptide was treated with a DCM/TIS/TFA 93/5/2 (v/v/v) solution for the Mmt group removal. Reductive alkylation with acetone/NaBH(OAc)s provided the W-isopropyl peptide.<br>
To avoid undesirable N,N-d±alkylation in reductive alkylation in the above procedure, which .may occur when<br><br>
straight chain alkyl aldehydes are used, an alternative was developed, wherein after the Mmt removal the amino group was first derivatised with 2-nitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride (o-NBS-Cl; see Fukuyama, T.; Jow, C.-K.; Cheung, N. Tetrahedron Lett. 1995, 36, 6373-6374). The resulting sulphonamide was then alkylated with an appropriate alcohol under conventional Mitsunobu reaction conditions, typically utilising TPP/DIAD in 1,2-dimethoxyethane (Mitsunobu, 0. Synthesis 1981, 1-2-8) . The o-NBS-Cl group was subsequently removed with 5% potassium thiophenolate ±r. DMF, after which the peptide was cleaved from the resin.<br>
Synthesis of peptides with Ar-alkylated side chair, in position no. 4:<br>
The peptides were assembled with Boc methodology. The residue in position no. 4 was introduced in the sequence as 3oc-Asp(OFm)-OH. After complete peptide assembly the side chain protection was removed with 30% piperidine in DMF. The resulting free carboxylic group was converted to the desired amide by coupling with an appropriate amine mediated by PyBOP or BOP/DIEA. The K-terminal Boc group was then removed, followed by EF cleavage, cyclisation and purification by HPLC,<br>

The amino acid derivatives used were Boc-Cys(Trt) -OH, Fmoc-Phe-OH, Fmoc-Ile-OH, Fmoc-Hgn-OH, Fmoc-Asn(Trt)-OK, Fraoc-CysETrt)-OHf Fmoc-Pro-OH, Fmoc-Orn(Mmt)-OH and Fmoc-Gly-OH. Fmoc-Hgn-OH was synthesised as mentioned above. Analytical HPLC was performed on a Waters 600 Liquid Chromatograph using a Vydac C18, 5u 4.6 x 250 mm, column at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Preparative HPLC was performed on a Waters 2000 Liquid Chromatograph using a Prepak 47 x 300 mm cartridge at a flow rate of IOC ml/min, Final compound analysis was performed on a 1100 Agilent Liquid Chromatograph using a Vydac C18r 5ja 2,1 x 250 mm, column at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Mass spectra were recorded on a Finnigan MAT spectrometer.<br>
The fully protected peptide resin was synthesised on an Applied Biosystems 9050 Peptide Synthesiser starting from 2 g (0.5 mmol) of Tentagel-S-RAM resin (Peptides International). DIC/HOBt mediated single couplings with a 4-fold excess of amino acid derivatives were performed. The Fmoc group was removed with 20% piperidine in DMF. Upon completion of the automated synthesis, the resin was transferred into a manual synthesis vessel and was treated with DCM/TIS/TFA 93/5/2 (v/v/v) solution (30 ml) for 2 x 1.5 hours for removal of the Mmt group. The resin was thoroughly washed with DCM and was subsequently<br>
suspended in 15 ml of 1,2-dichloroetehane/TMOF 1:1 (v/v) . 0.2 ml of acetone was then added followed by 0,6 g :;f NaBH(OAc)3. The suspension was shaken overnight and \:he resin was washed with methanol, DMF and DCM and dried in vacua. The resin was then treated with 30 ml of the TFA/TIS/%0 96/2/2 (v/v/v) solution for 1.5 hours and filtered off. The filtrate was evaporated and the crude linear peptide was precipitated with diethyl ether. The precipitate was immediately dissolved in 500 ml of 10% TFA (aq), and the peptide was oxidised by adding 0.1 M T2 in methanol to the magnetically stirred solution unzil yellow color persisted. Excess of iodine was reduced with ascorbic acid. The reaction mixture was then cooled with crushed ice and pH was adjusted to about 5 by'adding concentrated ammonia (aq) . The mixture was loaded onto an HPLC column and purified using a triethylammonium phosphate buffer with pH 5.2. The compound was eluted with a gradient of acetonitrile. The fractions with a purity exceeding 97% were pooled, and the resulting solution was diluted with 2 volumes of water. The solution was reloaded onto the column which was then washed with 2 1 of 0,1 M ammonium acetate (aq) and equilibrated with 2% acetic acid (aq). The compound was eluted with a fast (3%/min) gradient of acetonitrile. The fractions containing the desired product were pooled and lyophillsed.. 168 mg (-30% yield) of white amorphous powder was obtained. HPLC: Rt=8.5 min, gradient; 20-.<io b over min t-4q solvent a tfa j3 ch3cn purity: ms expected observed></io>
Compound 4? [Phe2,Asn (Et)4, Dbu8]VT :<br>
The amino acid derivatives used were Boc-Cys(Mob)-OH, Boc-Phe-OH, Boc-Ile-OH, Boc-Asp(OFm)-OH, Boc-Asn-OH, Boc-Pro-OH, Boc-Dbu(benzyloxycarbonyl)-OH DCHA salt and Boc-Gly-OH, all purchased from Novabiochem and Bachem.. HPLC and MS operations were performed as in the synthesis of compound 1.<br>
The fully protected peptide resin was manually synthesiseti starting from 0.6 g (0.4 mmol) of 4-methyl-benzhydrylamine resin (Novabiochem). DCC, PyBOP or DIC/HOBt mediated single couplings with 2.5-fold excess of amino acid derivatives were employed. The Boc group was removed with 50% TFA in DCM containing 1% of m-cresol. Upon completion of the synthesis/ the 9-fluoren-ylmethyl ester was removed from the p-carboxylic group of aspartic acid by treatment with 30% piperidine in DKF for 2 x 30 min. The resin was washed with 1 M HOBt in DMF solution for 30 rain and then twice with DMF only. The free carbcxylic group was amidated by overnight trea-ment with 2 mmcl of ethylamine/PyBOP/DIEA in DMF. The finished resin was washed with methanol, DMF and DCM and dried in vacua. The peptide was cleaved from the resin by using 30 ml of anhydrous HF containing 3 ml of anisole at 0°C for 90 minutes. The HF was evaporated off, and the crude linear pep-ide was washed with diethyl ether. The peptide was immediately dissolved in 200 nl of 25% acetonitrile/10% TFA (aq) and oxidised as described supra. The resulting mixture was loaded directly onto an HPLC column and purified using triethylammonium phosphate buffer at pH 2.3. The subsequent purification steps were identical to the procedure for compound 1^ 41 mg (-10% yield) of white amorphous powder was obtained. HPLC: Rt=10.0 min, gradient.: 20-*40% B over 20 min, t=40°C, solvent A 0.01% TFA (aq), solvent B 70% CH3CN, 0.01% TFA (ag) ; Purity: 100%; MS (M-t-H4) : expected 992,5, observed 992.2.<br>
The other compounds were prepared by analogous variation of these synthetic procedures. ^xperimer.tal (biological testing)<br>
In vritro receptor assays:<br>
Agonist activity of compounds on the hVla receptor was determined in a transcriptional reporter assay by transiently transfecting a hVla receptor expression DNA into HEK-293 cells in concert with a reporter DNA<br>
containing intracellular calcium responsive promoter elements regulating expression of firefly luciferase. See Boss, V., Talpade, D.J., Murphy, T.J. J. Bid. Chem. 1996, May 3; 271(18), 10429-10432 for further guidance on this assay. Cells were exposed to serial dilutions of compounds diluted 10-fold per dose for 5 hours, followed by lysis of cells, determination of luciferace activity, and determination of compound efficacies and ECso values through non-linear regression. Arginine-vasopressin (AVP) was used as an internal control in each experiment, ana compounds were tested in at least three independent experiments. To determine selectivity, compounds were tested in luciferase-based tr&amp;r.scriptional reporter assays expressing the human oxytocin (hOT) receptor. Assays for other receptors (hV2, hVlb, rat Via and rat V2) were also conducted.<br>
For further comparative purposes, other reference compounds used were [?he2,Qrn8]OT, terlipressin and 7180.<br>
The structure of [?he2,OrnB]OT is (SEQ ID NO: 51} :<br>
H-Cys-?he-Ile-Gln-Asn-Cys-Pro-Orn-Gly-NH2<br>
T<br>
The structure of F180 is (SEQ ID NO: 52): Hmp-Phe-Ile-Bgn-Asn-Cys-Pro-Dbu(Abu)-Gly-NH2<br>
The results of the in vitro assays are depicted in table 2 inr"ra. The EC5o value given is the geometric mean expressed in nanomol/L (nM). Selectivity values are given as ECso ratios.<br>
In vivo pharmacological tests:<br>
The compounds were tested in vivo for duration of action related to a standard dose of AVP. Blood pressure tests were carried out on anaesthetised Sprague-Dawley male rats (weighing 270-300 g) with catheterised jugular vein and carotid artery. The catheterised carotid artery<br>
WES used to continuously monitor blood pressure and the jugular vein was used for administration of the compounds tested. Rats received intravenous injections of dibenair.ine prior to dosing to enhance their responsiveness to Via receptor agonists (cf. Dekanski, J., Br. J. Pharmacol. 1952, 1, 567-572). The dosing procedure consisted of one intravenous injection of physiological saline followed by two consecutive injections of a standard dose of AVP (0.1 nmol/kg, * ED7o) , and three to five increasing doses of a giver, compound selected to give at least a response comparable to the standard dose of AVP. Dosing intervals were set as time for the blood pressure to decrease to a stable baseline.<br>
Determination of duration of action was based on the decay rate of diastolic arterial blood pressure transient increase. Specifically, for an exponential decay of plasma concentration, it can be shown that, if the response is measured beyond the distribution phase, the rate of decay near the ECso is linear and inversely proportional to the elimination half-life (Rowland, K. ani Tczer, T. in vClinical Pbzrmacokinetics, Concepts and Applications", 3rd ed., Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, Philadelphia, 1995},<br>
To measure the response decay rate for a given compound, a dose was selected that gave an amplitude of response as similar as possible to the amplitude of response to the second injection of the standard dose of AVP. To normalise for inter-individual variation in Vla-responsiveness, the duration of action was expressed as the ratio of decay rate for this reference AVP response to the decay rate for the eguieffective dose of compound for each rat tested. The results obtained for the compounds tested are set forth in table 2.<br>
