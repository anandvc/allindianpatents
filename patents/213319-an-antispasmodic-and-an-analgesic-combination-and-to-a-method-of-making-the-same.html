The granulation procedure performed by either of the two methods that may be by<br>
preparing the granules of the two active products separately using two differ binding<br>
systems so as to obtain the two different active granules or by making the granules in a<br>
single entity using a single binder system.<br>
The two different granules are manufactured by following methods<br>
Camvlofin Dihvdrochloride Granulation<br>
Dissolve dispensed quantity of binders in the solvent in a S.S. Container. Transfer the sifted Camylofin Dihydrochloride, matrix forming agents and diluents in a planetary mixer with variable speed ranges from 12 to 40 rpm and mix for 15 to 30 minutes so as to obtain a uniform mass. Transfer the binder solution slowly to the contents of planetary mixer and rotate the planetary mixer at slow speed for 10 to 20 minutes till the uniform dough is formed. Check the consistency and binding, if necessary additional wetting can be imparted with solvent. Pass this dough on multimill fitted with sieves of diameter ranges from 10 mm to 14 mm at medium speed. Transfer wet granules on F.B.D. bowl for drying at 50 °C to 55 °C for about 90 minutes. OR Transfer the wet granules on a tray drier for drying at 50° C for 6-10 hrs. Reck the granules occasionally while drying in a tray drier. Pass dried granules to 16-mesh sieve through vibrosifter and pass retained granules through multimill using 1.5mm screen at medium speed<br>

2.	LUBRICATION:<br>
Mix granules in double cone blender. Add the sifted in lubricants, glidents, surfactants, disintegrating agents and mix for 10 to 20 minutes. Lubricated granules obtained are ready for compression.<br>
3.	COMPRESSION:<br>

Pre Coating Process<br>
Environmental Conditions:<br>

Cellulose and/ or hydroxypropylmethylcellulose into the same container under fast stirring till the smooth and uniform slurry is formed. Stir them continuously for 25 minutes, just prior the actual use, pass the suspension through 80 # sieve. Transfer the dedusted tablets (cores) into the coating pan and heat the tablet bed by inching process using hot air blower. The initial temperature should not exceed 45°C - 50°C. Once the tablet bed attains 45°C, it is ready for spray coating. Start the exhaust. Continue spraying the tablet bed as per the parameter attached herewith. Discontinue temporarily spraying of the solution. If the tablet bed is formed to be slightly over wet, allow the bed to dry completely and then continue with spraying. After the last coat of ethyl cellulose solution is applied continue drying of the tablet for 15 - 20 minutes. Then proceed for final coating.<br>

Celsius in a tray drier for 6 hrs. The drying mass was raked during the process. The<br>
Loss on drying was 1.2%.<br>
The dry granules were sifted in an 18-mesh vibrosifter to obtain uniform sized camylofin<br>
granules.<br>
Step 2: making the nimesulide granules<br>
20 Kg of nimesulide, 10 kg of lactose, 10.0 kg of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose were<br>

the particles of nimesulide and the excipients resulted.<br>
600 gms of povidone was mixed with 10 Kg of purified water in a stainless steel [s.s.]<br>
tank under continuous stirring until a clear solution is formed and the binder was<br>
completely dissolved in the solvent. The solution was then added to the planetary mixer<br>
containing the homogenous mixture of the particles of nimesulide and excipients.<br>

compression pressure was set at 5 kg/sq cm .<br>
1,00,000 Cores were obtained :<br>
Dimension:<br>
Length-19.0 ±0.2 mm<br>
Width - 8.0 ± 0.2 mm<br>
Avg weight of core 674 mg ± 3 %.<br>
Step - 5: film - coating<br>
