	Field of the Invention<br>
5	The invention relates to personal care formulations containing keratin and their use in<br>
cosmetics.<br>
	Background of the invention<br>
	Proteins and their derivatives are used in a wide range of personal care formulations,<br>
10	including those intended for use on the hair, skin and nails. As a component of personal<br>
	care formulations, proteins perform many functions, including conditioning, film<br>
	forming, as a humectant and an emollient. Most commonly used proteins are<br>
	hydrolysed in order to impart sufficient solubility to facilitate inclusion in a formulation.<br>
	This is particularly the case with keratin proteins, which, are inherently insoluble due to<br>
15	the crosslinks associated with the characteristically high degree of cysteine present in<br>
	the protein. Numerous examples of the use of hydrolysed proteins, including keratins,<br>
	in personal care formulations are known in the art.<br>
	WO9851265 discloses the use of hydrolysed proteins and their derivatives, particularly<br>
20	those with high, sulfur content, in formulations to protect hair from the insults of<br>
	environmental and chemical damage. The inventors in WO9851265 use a combination<br>
	of hydrolysed proteins and a polyamino cationic agent in order to prepare the desired<br>
	formulations.<br>
25	US4948876 describes an S-sulphocysteine keratin peptide produced by enzymatic<br>
	hydrolysis for use as an auxiliary in the dyeing of wool and hair Enzymatic digestion is<br>
	used by the authors to prepare low molecular weight peptides and achieve the desired<br>
	solubility.<br><br>
	WO 2004/047774							PCT/NZ2003/000263<br>
2<br>
	US4S95722 discusses the use of a range of keratin decomposition products, including<br>
	those obtained by chemical and enzymatic hydrolysis, for the preparation of cosmetic<br>
	products.<br>
5	Keratin fibres, such as human hair, wool and other animal fibres, consist of a complex<br>
	mix of relaxed proteins that, are all part of the keratin family. These proteins can be<br>
	grouped according to their structure and role within the fibre into the following groups:<br>
		the intermediate filament proteins (IFP), which are fibrous proteins found mostly<br>
10		in the fibre cortex;<br>
		high sulfur proteins (HSP), which are globular proteins found in the matrix of<br>
		the fibre cortex, as well as in the cuticle.<br>
15		high glycine-tyrosine proteins (HGTP), found mostly in the fibre cortex.<br>
	The ulrastrucrture of keratin fibres is well known in the art, and discussed in detail by R.<br>
	C. Marshall, D. F. G. Orwin and J. M. Gillespie, Structure and Biochemistry of<br>
	Mammalian Hard Keratin, Electron Microscopy Reviews, 4, 47,1991. In the prior art<br>
20	described in which proteins are used as a cosmetic ingredient, the keratin utilized is<br>
	hydrolysed as one material, with no attempt at fractionating the keratin source into its<br>
	constituent components. As a result of protien hydrolysis, many of the desirable<br>
	properties of the proteins are lost. Low molecular weight keratin peptides aggregate<br>
	with a much lower degree of order to produce materials with much poorer physical<br>
25	properties than the high molecular weight keratins from which they are derived. In<br>
	addition, irreversible conversion of cysteine as may occur with chemical methods of<br>
	keratin, decomposition, yields, a peptide product that has lost the core functionality than<br>
	that distinguishes it from other protein materials.<br><br>
	WO 2004/047774							PCT/NZ2003/000263<br>
3<br>
	The need exists for personal care formulations which use intact keratins which maintain<br>
	many of the desirable characteristics of the native keratins from which they are derived<br>
	and possess a reactivity towards keratin substrates.<br>
5	Object of the Invention<br>
	It is an object of The invention to provide a personal care formulation which uses a<br>
	keratin protein or to at least provide the public with a useful choice.<br>

20	The invention provides personal care formulations in which the keratin protein fraction<br>
	is from the intermediate filament protein family.<br>
	The invention also provides a personal care formulation in which the keratin protein<br>
	fraction is from the high sulfur protein family.<br>

30<br><br>
	WO 2004/047774							PCT/NZ2003/000263<br>
4<br>
	Preferably the percentege of the intact S-sulfonated keratin protein fraction in the<br>
	formulation is less than ten percent by weight.<br>
	More preferably the ratio is between 0.001 and 1% inclusive by weight. However the<br>
5	 ratio may be from 0.001 % to 50% of keratin protein fraction.<br>
	The invention also provides a personal care fomation containing about 0.001% to 50%<br>
	of a keratin protein fraction.<br>

	Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
	The hard alpha keratin proteins such as those derived, from human hair, wool, animal<br>
	fibres, horns, hooves or other mammalian sources, can be classified into particuolar<br>
	components according to their biochemical properties, specifically their molecular<br>
10	weight and amino acid composition. Table 1 illustrates the amino acid composition<br>
	determined by conventional analytical methods of typical keratin protein fractions<br>
	known in the art and also the subject of this invention. This involves acid hydrolysis of<br>
	the analyte which converts all cystine and labile cysteine derivatives to cysteine,<br>
	typically recorded as half-cysteine.<br>

	most similar to the unkeratinised state of the protein. Mass is determined using<br>
	polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In the case of the peptide SPEP mass is determined<br>
	using mass spectrometry. Using these methods the Keratin is made soluble without any<br>
	hydrolysis of peptide bonds and an accurate measure of molecular weight is determined.<br>

	Both amino acid composition and molecular weight varies across keratin types, between<br>
	species and also within breeds of one species, for example between, wools from different<br>
	breeds of sheep. The figures gives in tables 1 and 2 are indicative for the keratin source<br>
10	stated. However, individual types of keratin proteins, or keratin protein, fractions, have<br>
	distinctive characteristic, particularly molecular weight and amino acid content.<br>
	The subject of the invention is formulations containing intact S-sulfonated keratin<br>
	protein fractions. "Intact" refers tO proteins that have not been. significantly hydrolysed,<br>
15	with hydrolysis being defined as the cleavage of bonds through the addition of water.<br>
	Gillespie (Biochemistry and physiology of the skin, vol 1, Ed. Goldsmith Oxford<br>
	University Press, London, 1983, pp475-510) considers "intact" to refer to proteins in the<br>
	keratinized polymeric state and further refers to polypeptide subunits which complex to<br>
	form intact keratins in wool and hair. For the purpose of this invention "intat" refers to<br>
20	the polypeptide subunits described by Gillespie. These are equivalent to the keratin<br>
	proteins in their native form without the disulfide crosslinks formed through the process<br>
	of keratinisation.<br>
	Keratin protein fracrtions are distinct groups from within the keratin protein family, such<br>
25	as the intermediate filament, proteins, the high sulfur proteins or the high glycine-<br>
	tyrosine proteins well known in the art. Intermediate filament proteins are described in<br>
	detail by Orwin et al (Structure and Biochemistry of Manunalian Hard Keratin,<br>
	Electron Microscopy Reviews, 4, 47,1991) and also referred to as low sulphur proteins<br>
	by Gilliespie (Biochemistry and physiology of the skin, vol 1, Ed. Goldsmith Oxford<br>
30	University Press. London, 1983, pp475-5lO). Key characteristics of this protein family<br>
	are molecular weight in the range 40 — 60 kD and a cystene content (measured as half<br><br>
	WO 2004/047774							PCT/NZ2003/000263<br>
9<br>
cystine of around 4%. The high sulfur protein family are also well described by Orwin<br>
	and Gillispie in the same publications. This protein family has a large degree of<br>
	heterogeity but can be characterised as having a molecular weight in the range 10 — 30<br>
	kD and a cysteine consent of greater than 10%. The subset of this family, the ultra high<br>
5	sulfur proteins can have a cysteine content of up to 34%. The high glycine-tryosine<br>
	protein family are also well described by Orwin and Gillespie in the same publications.<br>
	This family is also referred to as the high tryrosine proteins and has characteristics of a<br>
	molecular weight less than 10 KD, a tyrosine content typically greater than 10% and a<br>
	glycine content typically greater than 20%.<br>
10<br>
	For the purpose of this invention a "keratin protein fraction" is a purified form of<br>
	keratin that contains predominantly, although not entirely, one distinct protein group as<br>
	described above. In the content of this invention S-Sulfonated keratins, have<br>
	cysteine/cystine present predominantly in the form S-sulfocysteine, commonly known<br>
15	as the Bunte salt. This highly polar group imparts a degree of solubility to proteins<br>
	Whilst being stable in solution, the S-sulfo group is a labile cysteine derivative, highly<br>
	reactive towards thiols, such as cysteine, and other reducing agents. Reaction with<br>
	reducing agents leads to conversion of the S-sulfo cysteine group back to cysteine. S-<br>
	sulfo cysteine is chemically different to cysteic acid, although both groups contain the<br>
20	SO3 group. Cysteic acid is produced irreversibly by the oxidation of cysteine or cystine<br>
	and once formed cannot form disulfide crosslinks back to cysteine. S-sulfocystein is<br>
	reactive towards cysteine and readily forms disulfide crosslinks.<br>
	One aspect of the invention is personal care formulations containing S-sulfonated<br>
25	keratin intermediate- filament protein (SIFP). These proteins are characterised as having<br>
	a molecular weight in the range 40-60kD and a cysteine content determined through<br>
	amino acid analysis of around 4%. This material may be prepared by a variety of<br>
	methods, including those described in NZ/PCT02/00125. This material has excellent<br>
	film forming properties, and can be reconstituted in a variety of ways, such as those<br>
30	outlined in NZ/PCT02/00169. The characteristics of the material arise at least in part<br>
	from the intact nature of the fibrous proteins. Intermediate filament proteins are known<br><br>
	WO 2004/047774							PCT/NZ2003/000263<br>
10<br>
	to associate on a molecular level, which is fundamental to the reformation of the<br>
	proteins into materials. The ability of this material to act as a film former is a useful<br>
	cosmetic property. In addition, the S-sulfo group is of use in personal care formulations<br>
	as it is highly reactive towards thiols, forming a covalent disulfide bond. Thiols are<br>
5	present in the form of cysteine, particularly in hair damaged through reductive processes<br>
	such, as perming. In addition, as a highly polar group, the S-sulfo group is attracted to<br>
	polar substrates, such as the surface of hair damaged through oxidation processes and<br>
	bleaching. With this type of hair the SIFP can form, salt bridges and hydrogen bonds<br>
	and consequently impart a durable conditioning effect.<br>
10<br>
	A further aspect of the invention is cosmetic formulations containing S-sulfonated<br>
	keratin high sulfur protein (SHSP). These proteins are characterised as having a<br>
	molecular weight in the range 10-30kD and a cysteine content determined through<br>
	amino acid analysis of greater than 10%. This material may be prepared by a variety of<br>
15	methods, including those described in NZ/PCT02/O0125. As an intact globular protein<br>
	derived from the matrix proteins of the keratin fibre cortex, and also the cuticle cells,<br>
	this material has the potential to repair damaged hair, in particular where split ends will<br>
	allow penetration of this intact protein into the fibre. In addition, with a higher<br>
	proportion, of cysteine than commercially available keratin derivatives typically used in<br>
20	personal care formulations, the potential to bind to damaged hair, or to bind to hair<br>
	when, used as part of a permanent waving process, is significant.<br>
	One aspect of the invention is keratin peptides derived from Keratin protein fractions.<br>
	These peptides have a cysteine content similar to the fraction from which the peptide is<br>
25	derived (approximately 4% for SIFP-pep and greater than 10% for SHSP-pep). Being of<br>
	low molecular weight these materials can penetrate the surface of hair and skin and<br>
	provide cosmetic function within the substrate. This material is differentiated from other<br>
	hydrolysed keratins by virtue of being derived from a particular keratin protein fraction,<br>
	as well as the cysteine being present as S-sulfo cysteine. A source of peptides with<br>
30	variable amounts of cysteine is of particular value in the formulation of cosmetics.<br><br>
	WO 2004/047774							PCT/NZ2003/000263<br>
11<br>
	One aspect of the invention is personal care formulations containing S-sulfonated<br>
	keratin peptides derived from bulk keratin. These peptides are characterised as having a<br>
	molecular weight approximately lkD or less and a cysteine content determined through<br>
	amino acid analysis of approximately 4%. This material may be prepared by a variety<br>
5	of methods, including those described in NZ/PCT02/00125. This material is<br>
	differentiated from other hydrolysed keratins by virtue of the cysteine being present in<br>
	the form of S-sulfo groups. The low molecular weight of this material allows it to<br>
	penetrate through the hair cuticle. This feature, combined with the S-sulfo groups<br>
	present on the peptide and the reactivity of this group creates a useful ingredient for the<br>
10	formulation of cosmetics, in particular hair cosmetics.<br>
	Keratins are characterised by having a higher cysteine content than other proteins. In<br>
	some protein fractions derived from wool cysteine contents as high as 30% have been<br>
	reported Cysteine is a known reductant and keratin protein fractions that are the subject<br>
15	of this invention are reductants and antioxidants that can be used as an active<br>
	component in personal care formulations targeted at anti ageing, or reducing oxidative<br>
	damage to hair and skin caused by free radicals, pollutants and environmental insults.<br>
	Measurements of antioxidant properties of keratin protein fractions are detailed in Table<br>
	3.<br>

15	It also includes any personal care formulation intended to improve the appearance.<br>
	Unless the contest clearly requires otherwise, throughout the description and the claims,<br>
	the words "comprise", "comprising" and the like, are to be construed in an inclusive<br>
	sense as opposed to an exclusive or exhaustive sense, that is to say, in the sense of<br>
20	"including, but not limited to".<br>
	The invention will now be described, by way of example only and with reference to the<br>
	accompanying Examples which, are by way of exemplification only.<br>
25	Examples<br>
	In each formulation 'keratin fraction' is included at an indicative level. Keratin fraction<br>
	refers to SIFP, SIFP-pep, SHSP, SHSP-pep, HGTP or S-sulfonated keratin peptides, all<br>
	of which are described above. Unless otherwise stated, it is convenient to provide the<br>
	keratin fraction in the form of a dilute aqueous solution and include the appropriate<br>
30	amount of this solution in the formulation to achieve the keratin fraction level indicated.<br><br>
	WO 2004/047774							PCT/NZ2003/000263<br>
13<br>
	Typical concentrations of aqueous solutions for the keratin fraction types are SIFP 5%,<br>
	SHSP 15% and S-sulfonated keratin peptides 15%. Therefore, in order to achieve the<br>
	indicated level of 0.5% keratin fraction for SIFP, 10% of an SIFP solution would to be<br>
	used in the formulation. Percentages are expressed as w/v.<br>

5<br>
	Hair swatches 2-3g were used. Experiments were performed in duplicate.<br>
	Swatches were shampooed prior to use to remove residual conditioning agents.<br>
	Swatches were either left undamaged, or were subjected to multiple perming procedures<br>
	or bleaching procedures.<br>
10	Swatches were equilibrated at 50% RH and weighed accurately.<br>
	Keratin fractions were applied to the swatches either from an aqueous solution or as part<br>
	of a shampoo formulation at a level of 3.0ml per swatch.<br>
	The treatment solution was spread onto the swatch with fingertips, allowed to absorb for<br>
	1 min and rinsed under a stream of RO water.<br>
15	The swatch was air-dried and equilibrated at 50% RH for 24 in prior to weighing.<br>

	Table 8: Percentage weight gain at 50% relative humidity for damaged and undamaged<br>
	hair with and without treatment with a solution or shampoo formulation containing<br>
	SIFP,SHSP and SPEP.<br>
5	This study indicates that the SIFP keratin fraction is substantive to undamaged, permed<br>
	and bleached hair from both an aqueous solution and shampoo formulation. The SHSP<br>
	keratin fraction is also substantive from an aqueous solution and shampoo fomulation<br>
	and seems to adsorb to a greater extent to bleached and permed hair and when applied<br>
	as a solution rather than a shampoo. The keratin fraction which has molecular weight<br>
10	less than 1kD, SPEP, is substantive to bleached and permed hair from an aqueous<br>
	solution and shampoo however it was not associated with a weight increase on<br>
	undamaged hair. A much greater weight increase was observed from an aqueous<br>
	solution indicating that the surfactants present in the shampoo may be removing the<br>
	keratin fraction.<br>
15<br>
	These results indicate that the different keratin fractions have different surface activity<br>
	on the hair fibre. The larger fractions have a greater ability to form adsorbing layers and<br>
	convey a conditioning and smoothing (gloss) effect compared with the low molecular<br>
	weight SPEP.<br>

	Example 3: Moisturisation<br>
	Experimental procedure<br>
	Hair swatches 2-3 g were used Each treatment within the experiment was performed in<br>
25	duplicate.<br>
	Swatches were shampooed with a high surfactant (non-conditioning) shampoo prior to<br>
	use to remove residual conditioning agents.<br>
	Swatches were either left undamaged, or were subjected to multiple perming or<br>
	bleaching procedures.<br>
30	Swatches were equilibrated at 50% RH for 24 hrs and weighed accurately.<br>
	Swatches were equilibrated at 73% RH for 24 hrs and weighed accurately.<br><br>

35<br>
	The difference in weight as a result of increased humidity (in the absence of protein<br>
	treatment) was calculated.<br>
	Swatches were treated (in duplicate) with either an aqueous solution containing a<br>
	keratin fraction or a shampoo containing a keratin fraction (as described earlier).<br>
5	Swatches were equilibrated for 24 hrs and weighed at 50% RH.<br>
	Swatches were equilibrated for 24 hr and weighed at 73% RH.<br>
	The difference in weight as a result of increased humidity following treatment with a<br>

	permed, bleached and undamaged hair at high humidity when applied as an aqueous<br>
	solution or in a shampoo.<br>
	The SHSP fraction had less of an effect on moisture uptake at high humidity and there<br>
5	was some indication that moisturisation decreased when applied from a shampoo in<br>
	preference to an aqueous solution.<br>
	SPEP increased moisture uptake particularly when applied from a shampoo.<br>
10	Example 4: Foaming of formulations<br>

	Waring Blender Test<br>
	Method:<br>
15	1.	Prepare 100 mL of a 5% solution of material to be tested.<br>
	2.	Pour into blender.<br>
	3.	Blend for 1 minute on high.<br>
	4.	Pour all the liquid into 500 mL measuring cylinder,<br>
	5.	Record the amount of foam (-100 ml,) immediately and record.<br>

	Table 10. Foam quantity and stability in a waring blender test. Results are expressed as.<br>
	foam volume immediately following blending and after 5 minutes.<br>
5	This study indicates that the SIFP keratin fraction shows mild foaming and forms stable<br>
	foams. The SHSP fraction displayed intermediate foaming ability and formed very<br>
	stable foams. SPEP formed unstable foams. The addition of the ion sequestering agent<br>
	EDTA increased the foaming capacity of all fractions.<br>

	Table 11: Foam quantity and stability of keratin fraction mixtures in a waring blender<br>
	test. Results are expressed as foam volume immediately following blending and after 5<br>
	minutes.<br>
5	This study indicates that addition of the SHSP keratin fraction to the less foaming SIFP<br>
	fraction increases the foam capacity.<br>
	Test example 9. Foaming of shampoo formulations containing keratin fractions.<br>
	Shampoo formulation described earlier, containing 0.5% active keratin fraction.<br>

	SPEP in a waring blender test Results are expressed as foam volume immediately<br>
15	following blending and after 5 minutes.<br>
	It is known that proteins of ten have an adverse effect of foaming in formulations.<br>
	This study indicates that addition of the SIFP keratin fraction to a shampoo formulation<br>
	does not have a deleterious effect on foaming, moreover there is some evidence that<br>
20	foam stability in increased. Furthermore addition of the SHSP fraction to a shampoo<br>
	formulation increases the foaming capacity and results in a greater foam after i minutes<br>
	compared to that in the absence of the keratin. The SPEP keratin fraction does suppress<br>
	foam formation.<br>

	WO 2004/047774							PCT/NZ2003/000263<br>
39<br>
	Method<br>
	Human volunteers were given two unlabelled shampoo formulations (described earlier),<br>
	one of which contained 0.5% active of the SIFP keratin fraction.<br>
	Volunteers were asked to wash their hair with one sample as many times as usual over<br>
5	the period of one week and then repeat with the other sample.<br>
	Volunteers were then given a questionnaire to fill out ranking each sample in terms of<br>
	foaming ability, gloss impartment, hair feel, combablility, and appearance.<br>
	The lower number was associated with an undesirable effect eg in the case of<br>
	combability 1= extremely difficult to comb and 6 = excellent combability.<br>
10<br>
	Test example 10<br>
	Questionnaires were collected and the scores recorded and averaged.<br>
	Results are summarized in Table 13 and Figure 9.<br><br>
15<br>
	Table 13. Subjective assessment of a shampoo formulation with and without SIFP.<br>
	Results are an average of scores recorded by human volunteers.<br>
	This study indicates that volunteers did net observe a major change in foaming of the<br>
20	shampoo formulation as a result of addition of the keratin fraction. Moreover the<br>
	presence of the keratin fraction was observed to impart superior gloss, feel, combability<br>
	and improved appearance to the formalation indicating that it was acting as a<br>
	conditioning agent.<br><br>
