COMPOUNDS FOR TREATMENT OF INFLAMMATION, DIABETES AND<br>
RELATED DISORDERS<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
[0001]	This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application No.<br>
60/334,818, filed November 29, 2001, and is incorporated herein, in its entirety, by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	The invention is directed to compounds, for example, heterocyclic<br>
derivatives of acyl urea, thiourea, carbamate and thiocarbamate compounds, that provide a variety of useful pharmacological effects. The compounds are useful, for example, in lowering blood glucose levels in hyperglycemic disorders, such as diabetes mellitus, and for treating related disorders, such as obesity and hyperlipidemia. Furthermore, these compounds are useful for treatment of disorders associated with insulin resistance, such as polycystic ovary syndrome, and for the treatment of inflammation, inflammatory and immunological diseases, particularly those mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-6), type 4 and type 3 phosphodiesterase (PDE4 and PDE3, respectively), p44/42 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and/or inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS).<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003]	The causes of diabetes mellitus are not yet known, although both<br>
genetics and environment seem to be major factors. Type 1 diabetes, also known as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), is an autoimmune disease in which the responsible autoantigen is still unidentified. Since their insulin-producing pancreatic cells are destroyed, Type 1 diabetics need to take insulin parenterally to survive. On the other hand, type 2 diabetes, also called non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), the more common form, is a metabolic disorder resulting from the body's inability to make a sufficient amount of insulin or to properly use the insulin that is produced. Impaired insulin seer0*'""1" ar"* '■■—,;- -esistance are considered the major<br><br>
defects; however, the precise genetic factors involved in the mechanism remain unknown.<br>
[0004]	Other than insulin administered parenterally and as shown in Table 1,<br>
there are generally four major classes of oral hypoglycemic agents currently used in the treatment of diabetes mellitus:<br><br>
[0005]	As is shown in the above table, each of the current agents available for<br>
use in treatment of diabetes mellitus has several disadvantages. Accordingly, there is a need for the identification and development of new agents, particularly, water<br><br>
soluble agents which can be orally administered, for use in the treatment of diabetes mellttus and other hyperglycemic disorders.<br>
[0006]	Moreover, while the thiazolidinedione class has gained more<br>
widespread use in recent years as insulin sensitizers to combat "insulin resistance", a condition in which the patient becomes less responsive to the effects of insulin, there is a need for frequent liver testing for patients using these compounds. In fact, the known thiazolidinediones are not effective for a significant portion of the patient population. In addition, the first drug in this class to be approved by the FDA, troglitazone, was withdrawn from the market due to problems of liver toxicity. Thus, there is a continuing need for nontoxic, more widely effective insulin sensitizers.<br>
[0007]	As indicated above, the invention is also directed to the treatment of<br>
immunological diseases or inflammation, in particular, such diseases as are mediated by cytokines, COX-2 and iNOS. The principal elements of the immune system are macrophages or antigen-presenting cells, T cells and B cells. Macrophages are important mediators of inflammation and also provide the necessary "help" for T cell stimulation and proliferation. For example, macrophages make the cytokines IL-1, IL-12 and TNF-alpha, all of which are potent pro-inflammatory molecules. Cytokine production may lead to the secretion of other cytokines, altered cellular function, cell division or differentiation. In addition, activation of macrophages results in the induction of enzymes, such as GOX-2 and iNOS, and in the production of free radicals capable of damaging normal cells. Many factors activate macrophages, including bacterial products, superantigens and interferon gamma. It is believed that phosphotyrosine kinases and other cellular kinases are involved in the activation process. Since macrophages are sentinel to the development of an immune response, agents that modify their function, specifically their cytokine secretion profile, are likely to determine the direction and potency of the immune response.<br>
[0008]	Inflammation is the body's normal response to injury or infection.<br>
However, in inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, pathologic inflammatory processes can lead to morbidity and mortality. The cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) plays a central role in the inflammatory response<br><br>
and has been targeted as a point of intervention in inflammatory disease. TNF-alpha is a polypeptide hormone released by activated macrophages and other cells. At low concentrations, TNF-alpha participates in the protective inflammatory response by activating leukocytes and promoting their migration to extravascular sites of inflammation (Moser et al., J Clin Invest, 83:444-55, 1989). At higher concentrations, TNF-alpha can act as a potent pyrogen and induce the production of other pro¬inflammatory cytokines (Haworth etal., Eur J Immunol, 21:2575-79, 1991; Brennan et al., Lancet, 2:244-7,1989). TNF-alpha also stimulates the synthesis of acute-phase proteins. In rheumatoid arthritis, a chronic and progressive inflammatory disease affecting about 1% of the adult U.S. population, TNF-alpha mediates the cytokine cascade that leads to joint damage and destruction (Arend et al., Arthritis Rheum, 38:151-60, 1995). Inhibitors of TNF-alpha, including soluble TNF receptors (etanercept) (Goldenberg, Clin Ther, 21:75-87, 1999) and anti-TNF-alpha antibody (infliximab) (Luong et al., Ann Pharmacother, 34:743-60, 2000), the contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference, have recently been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as agents for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.<br>
[0009]	Elevated levels of TNF-alpha have also been implicated in many other<br>
disorders and disease conditions, including cachexia (Fong et al., Am J Physiol, 256.R659-65, 1989), septic shock syndrome (Tracey et al., Proc Soc Exp Biol Med, 200:233-9, 1992), osteoarthritis (Venn et al., Arthritis Rheum, 36:819-26, 1993), inflammatory bowel disease such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (Murch et al., Gut, 32:913-7,1991), Behcet's disease (Akoglu etal., J Rheumatol, 17:1107-8, 1990), Kawasaki disease (Matsubara et al., Clin Immunol Immunopathol, 56:29-36, 1990), cerebral malaria (Grau et al., N Engl J Med, 320:1586-91, 1989), adult respiratory distress syndrome (Millar et al„ Lancet 2:712-4, 1989), asbestosis and silicosis (Bissonnetteetal., Inflammation, 13:329-39,1989), pulmonary sarcoidosis (Baughman et al., J Lab Clin Med, 115:36-42, 1990), asthma (Shah et al., Clin Exp Allergy, 25:1038-44, 1995), AIDS (Dezube et al., J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr, 5:1099-104,1992), meningitis (Waage et al., Lancet, 1:355-7, 1987), psoriasis (Oh et al., J Am Acad Dermatol, 42:829-30, 2000), spondyloarthritides such as ankylosing spondylitis (Braun et al., Curr Opin Rheumatol 13:245-9, 2001; Marzo-Ortega et al., Arthritis Rheum 44:2112-7, 2001), graft versus host reaction (Nestel et<br><br>
al., J Exp Med, 175:405-13,1992), multiple sclerosis (Sharief et a!., N Engl J Med, 325:467-72,1991), systemic lupus erythematosus (Maury et al,, Int J Tissue React, 11:189-93, 1989), diabetes (Hotamisligil et al., Science, 259:87-91, 1993) and atherosclerosis (Bruunsgaard et al., Clin Exp Immunol, 121:255-60, 2000), the contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference. It can be seen from the references cited above that inhibitors of TNF-alpha are potentially useful in the treatment of a wide variety of diseases.<br>
[00010]        lnterleukin-6 (IL-6) is another pro-inflammatory cytokine that exhibits pleiotropy and redundancy of action. IL-6 participates in the immune response, inflammation and hematopoiesis. It is a potent inducer of the hepatic acute phase response and is a powerful stimulator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis that is under negative control by glucocorticoids. IL-6 promotes the secretion of growth hormone but inhibits release of thyroid stimulating hormone. Elevated levels of IL-6 are seen in several inflammatory diseases, and inhibition of the IL-6 cytokine subfamily has been suggested as a strategy to improve therapy for rheumatoid arthritis (Carroll et al., Infiamm Res, 47:1-7, 1998). In addition, IL-6 has been implicated in the progression of atherosclerosis and the pathogenesis of coronary heart disease (Yudkin et al., Atherosclerosis, 148:209-14, 1999). Overproduction of IL-6 is also seen in steroid withdrawal syndrome, conditions related to deregulated vasopressin secretion, and osteoporosis associated with increased bone resorption, such as in cases of hyperparathyroidism and sex-steroid deficiency (Papanicolaou et al., Ann Intern Med, 128:127-37,1998). Since excessive production of IL-6 is implicated in several disease states, it is highly desirable to develop compounds that inhibit IL-6 secretion.<br>
[00011]	The cytokine IL-1 beta also participates in the inflammatory response.<br>
It stimulates thymocyte proliferation, fibroblast growth factor activity, and the release of prostaglandin from synovial cells. Elevated or unregulated levels of the cytokine IL-1 beta have been associated with a number of inflammatory diseases and other disease states, including but not limited to adult respiratory distress syndrome (Meduri et al, Chest 107:1062-73,1995), allergy (Hastie et al, Cytokine 8:730-8, 1996), Alzheimer's disease (O'Barr et al, J Neuroimmunol 109:87-94, 2000), anorexia (Laye et al, Am J Physio! Regul Integr Comp Physiol 279:R93-8, 2000),<br><br>
asthma (Sousa et al, Thorax 52:407-10,1997), atherosclerosis (Dewberry et al, Arterioscler Thromb Vase Biol 20:2394-400, 2000), brain tumors (llyfn et al, Mol Chem Neuropathol 33:125-37, 1993), cachexia (Nakatani et al, Res Commun Mol Pathol Pharmacol 102:241-9,1998), carcinoma (Ikemoto et al, Anticancer Res 20:317-21, 2000), chronic arthritis (van den Berg et al, Clin Exp Rheumatol 17:S105-14,1999), chronic fatigue syndrome (Cannon et al, J Clin Immunol 17:253-61,1997), CNS trauma (Herx et al, J Immunol 165:2232-9, 2000), epilepsy (De Simoni et al, Eur J Neurosci 12:2623-33, 2000), fibrotic lung diseases (Pan et al, Pathol Int 46:91-9, 1996), fulminant hepatic failure (Sekiyama et al, Clin Exp Immunol 98:71-7,1994), gingivitis (Biesbrock et al, Monogr Oral Sci 17:20-31, 2000), glomerulonephritis (Kluth et al, J Nephrol 12:66-75, 1999), Guillain-Barre syndrome (Zhu et al, Clin Immunol Immunopathol 84:85-94,1997), heat hyperalgesia (Opree et al, J Neurosci 20:6289-93,2000), hemorrhage and endotoxemia (Parsey et al, J Immunol 160:1007-13,1998), inflammatory bowel disease (Olson et al, J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr 16:241-6, 1993), leukemia (Estrov et al, Leuk Lymphoma 24:379-91, 1997), leukemic arthritis (Rudwaleit et al, Arthritis Rheum 41:1695-700, 1998), systemic lupus erythematosus (Mao et al, Autoimmunity 24:71-9, 1996), multiple sclerosis (Martin et al, J Neuroimmunol 61:241-5, 1995), osteoarthritis (Hernvann et al, Osteoarthritis Cartilage 4:139-42, 1996), osteoporosis (Zheng et al, Maturitas 26:63-71,1997), Parkinson's disease (Bessler et al, Biomed Pharmacother 53:141-5, 1999), POEMS syndrome (Gherardi et al, Blood 83:2587-93,1994), pre-term labor (Dudley, J Reprod Immunol 36:93-109, 1997), psoriasis (Bonifati et al, J Biol Regul Homeost Agents 11:133-6, 1997), reperfusion injury (Clark et al, J Surg Res 58:675-81, 1995), rheumatoid arthritis (Seitz et al, J Rheumatol 23:1512-6,1996), septic shock (van Deurenetal, Blood 90:1101-8,1997), systemic vasculitis (Brooks etal, Clin Exp Immunol 106:273-9,1996), temporal mandibular joint disease (Nordahl et a), Eur J Oral Sci 106:559-63, 1998), tuberculosis (Tsao et al, Tuber Lung Dis 79:279-85,1999), viral rhinitis (Roseler et al, Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol Suppl 1 :S61-3, 1995), the contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference, and pain and/or inflammation resulting from strain, sprain, trauma, surgery, infection or other disease processes. Since overproduction of IL-1 beta is associated with numerous disease conditions, it is desirable to develop compounds that inhibit the production or activity of IL-1 beta.<br><br>
[00012]        CycloGAyycuase is an enzyme that catalyzes a rate-detei mining step in the biosynthesis of prostaglandins, which are important mediators of inflammation and pain. The enzyme occurs as at least two distinct isomers, cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). The COX-1 isomer is constitutivety expressed in the gastric mucosa, platelets and other cells and is involved in the maintenance of homeostasis in mammals, including protecting the integrity of the digestive tract. The COX-2 isomer, on the other hand, is not constitutively expressed but rather is induced by various agents, such as cytokines, mitogens, hormones and growth factors. In particular, COX-2 is induced during the inflammatory response (DeWfflDL, Biochim Biophys Acta, 1083:121-34,1991; Seibert et al., Receptor, 4:17-23, 1994.). Aspirin and other conventional non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are non-selective inhibitors of both COX-1 and COX-2. They can be effective in reducing inflammatory pain and swelling, but since they hamper the protective action of COX-1, they produce undesirable side effects of gastrointestinal pathology. Therefore, agents that selectively inhibit COX-2 but not COX-1 are preferable for treatment of inflammatory diseases. Recently, a diaryIpyrazole sulfonamide (celecoxib) that selectively inhibits COX-2 has been approved by the FDA for use in the treatment of osteoarthritis and adult rheumatoid arthritis (Luong et at., Ann Pharmacother, 34:743-60, 2000; Penning et al., J Med Chem, 40:1347-65, 1997). Another selective COX-2 inhibitor, rofecoxib, has been approved by the FDA for treatment of osteoarthritis, acute pain and primary dysmenorrhea (Scott and Lamb, Drugs, 58:499-505,1999; Morrison et al., Obstet Gynecol, 94:504-8^ 1999; Saag et al, Arch Fam Med, 9:1124-34, 2000). COX-2 is also expressed in many cancers and precancerous lesions, and there is mounting evidence that selective COX-2 inhibitors may be useful for treating and preventing colorectal, breast and other cancers (Taketo MM, J Natl Cancer Inst, 90:1609-20,1998; Fournier et al., J Cell Biochem Suppl, 34:97-102, 2000; Masferreret al., Cancer Res, 60:1306-11, 2000), the contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference. In 1999 celecoxib was approved by the FDA as an adjunct to usual care for patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, a condition which, left untreated, generally leads to colorectal cancer.<br>
[00013]	Production of nitric oxide by iNOS has been associated with both<br>
beneficial and detrimental effects in inflammation, inflammatory diseases and related<br><br>
disorders. For example, deleterious effects have been implicated in the pathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurysms (Johanning et al, J Vase Surg 33:579:86,2001), acute endotoxemia (Henntngsson et al, Am J Physiol Cell Physiol 280:01242-54, 2001), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Sasaki et al, Neurosci Lett 291:44-8, 2000), atherosclerosis (Behr-Roussel etal, Circulation 102:1033-8, 2000), bladder cancer (Wolf et al, Virchows Arch 437:662-6, 2000), colon cancer (Watanabe et al, Biofactors 12:129-33, 2QQ0), cystitis (Alfieri et al, Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol 363:353-7, 2001), HIV-1 encephalitis (Zhao et al, J Neuroimmunol 115:182-91, 2001), inflammatory bowel disease (Singer etal, Gastroenterology 111:871-85, 1996), multiple sclerosis (Pozza et al, Brain Res 855:39-46, 2000), osteoarthritis (Pelfetier et al, Osteoarthritis Cartilage 7:416-8, 1999), osteoporosis (Armour et al, J Bone Miner Res 14:2137-42, 1999), portal hypertension (Schroeder etal, Dig Dis Sci Dec45:2405-10, 2000), pulmonary edema in endotoxin shock (Lee et al, Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol 28:315-20, 2001), rheumatoid arthritis (van't Hof et al, Rheumatology (Oxford) 39:1004-8, 2000), sepsis (Nishina et al, Anesth Analg 92:959-66, 2001), severe burn/smoke inhalation injury (Soejima et al, Am J Respir Crit Care Med 163:745-52, 2001), and ulcerative colitis (Ikeda et al, Am J Gastroenterol 92:1339-41, 1997), the contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference. Since the production of nitric oxide by iNOS has been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory and related immunological diseases, it is desirable to develop compounds that inhibit iNOS activity or expression.<br>
[00014]	Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are responsible for the hydrolysis of<br>
intracellular cyclic adenosine and guanosine monophosphate (cAMP and cGMP), which converts these second messengers into their inactive forms. There are 11 major families of PDEs, designated PDE1 to PDE11. Type 4 phosphodiesterase (PDE4) is found in airway smooth muscle cells and in immune and inflammatory cells. PDE4 activity has been associated with a wide variety of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, and PDE4 inhibitors have been studied as potential therapeutic agents for such diseases as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and type 2 diabetes (Burnouf and Pruniaux, Current Pharm Des, 8:1255-96, 2002; Dal Piaz and Giovannoni, Eur J Med Chem, 35:463-80, 2000). Type 3 phosphodiesterase (PDE3) is localized in platelets and cardiac and vascular smooth muscle cells. Inhibitors of PDE3 have<br><br>
been proposed as possible drugs for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (Schermulyet al, J Pharmacol Exp Ther, 292:512-20, 2000), cancer (Shimizu et al, Anticancer Drugs, 13:875-80, 2002; Murata et al. Anticancer Drugs, 12:79-83, 2001), cardiomyopathy (Alharethi and Movsesian, Expert Opin Investig Drugs, 11:1529-36, 2002), congestive heart failure (Movsesian, J Am Col) Cardiol, 34:318-24, 1999), erectile dysfunction (Kuthe et al, CurrOpin Investig Drugs, 3:1489-95, 2002), and T-cell-mediated autoimmune disorders (Bielekova et al, J Immunol 164:1117-24, 2000), the contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[00015]        Activation of lymphocyte and macrophage immune response to pathogens involve complex intracellular signaling pathways involving a cascade of various phosphorylating enzymes, kinases that ultimately regulate cytokine production and cell apoptosis. Key kinases include p44/42 MAP kinase (also known as ERK1/ERK2), P38 MAP kinase, MEK, and IRAK/NFkB. While different processes utilize different aspects of the pathway, the bacterial coat-derived protein LPS has been shown to activate multiple mitogen-activated protein kinases, including the extracellular signal-regulated receptor kinases ERK1 and ERK2. LPS-induced TNF-alpha production by human monocytes involves activation of ERK1/ERK2 (van der Bruggen et al, Infect Immun, 67:3824-9,1999). As TNF-alpha is a key mediator of autoimmune disease, blocking the ERK pathway has potential for the treatment of inflammatory and immunological diseases such as lupus (Yi et al, J Immunol, 165:6627-34, 2000), rheumatoid arthritis (Neff et al, Cell Microbiol, 3:703-12, 2001; Schett et al, Arthritis Rheum, 43:2501-12, 2000), psoriasis (van der Bruggen et al, Infect Immun, 67:3824-9, 1999) and destruction of pancreatic islet beta cells in Type I diabetes (Pavlovic et al, Eur Cytokine Netw 11:267-74, 2000), the contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[00016]        It will be appreciated from the foregoing that, while there have been extensive prior efforts to provide compounds for inhibiting, for example, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, COX-2, PDE4 or other agents considered responsible for inflammation or inflammatory diseases, e.g. arthritis, there still remains a need for new and improved compounds for effectively treating or inhibiting such diseases. A principal object of the invention is to provide compounds which are effective for such<br><br>
treatments as well as for the treatment of, for example, diabetes, coronary heart disease, insulin resistance and related disorders.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [00017J        The invention is directed to compounds, for example, heterocyclic derivatives of acyl urea, thiourea, carbamate and thiocarbamate compounds, for providing a variety of useful pharmacological effects. The compounds are .useful, for example, in lowering blood glucose levels in hyperglycemic disorders, such as diabetes mellitus, and for treating related disorders, such as obesity and hyperlipidemia.

[00081]        These compounds are useful for treating diabetes and other diseases linked to insulin resistance, such as coronary artery disease and peripheral vascular disease, and also for treating or inhibiting inflammation or inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory arthritides and collagen vascular diseases, which are caused by, for example, cytokines or inducible enzymes such as TNF-alpha, IL-1, IL-8, PDE4, PDE3, p44/42 MAP kinase, iNOS and/or COX-2. The compounds are also useful for treating or preventing other diseases mediated by cytokines, PDE4, PDE3, p44/42 MAP kinase, iNOS and/or COX-2, such as cancer.<br>
[00082]        As indicated above, the compounds of the invention include bonds, designated in Formulas I - XIII with a dashed line plus a solid line, that may be either a double bond or a single bond. When such a bond is a double bond, it may have either the E or 2 configuration. On the other hand, when such a bond is a single bond, the resulting stereocenters may be in the R-and/or S- configurations. Likewise, compounds of the invention with other stereocenters, designated in Formulas I - XIII with an asterisk, may be R-and/or S- stereoisomers. The invention contemplates racemic mixtures of such stereoisomers as well as the individual, separated stereoisomers. The individual stereoisomers may be obtained by the use of an optically active resolving agent. Alternatively, a desired enantiomer may be obtained by stereospecific synthesis using an optically pure starting material of known configuration.<br>
[00083]        Generally, R- or S- refers to the configuration of the stereoisomers, The determination of whether the configuration is R- (rectus)<br><br>
or S- (sinister) » uased on the priority of the atoms in a compound. Similarly, E- or Z- configuration is used when describing compounds with double bonds and wherein the determination is based on the priority of the atom on each carbon of a double bond.<br>

[000127]       However, it will be appreciated that the invention also contemplates the provision and use of other compounds according to Formulas I - XIII.<br>
[000128]       The compounds according to the present invention may be combined with a physiologically acceptable carrier or vehicle to provide a pharmaceutical composition, such as, lyophilized powder in the form of tablet or capsule with various fillers and binders. Similarly, the compounds may be coadministered with other agents. Co-administration shall mean the administration of at least two agents to a<br><br>
subject so as to provide the beneficial effects of the combination of both agents. For example, the agents may be administered simultaneously or sequentfally over a period of time. The effective dosage of a compound in the composition can be widely varied as selected by those of ordinary skill in the art and may be empirically determined. Moreover, the compounds of the present invention can be used alone or in combination with one or more additional agents depending on the indication and the desired therapeutic effect. For example, in the case of diabetes, insulin resistance and associated conditions or complications, including obesity and hyperlipidemia, such additional agent(s) may be selected from the group consisting of: insulin or an insulin mimetic, a sulfonylurea (such as acetohexamide, chlorpropamide, glimepiride, glipizide, glyburide, tolbutamide and the like) or other insulin secretagogue (such as nateglinide, repaglinide and the like), a thiazolidinedione (such as piogiitazone, rosiglitazone and the like) or other peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonist, a fibrate (such as bezafibrate, clofibrate, fenofibrate, gemfibrozol and the like) or other PPAR-alpha agonist, a PPAR-delta agonist, a biguanide (such as metformin), a statin (such as fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin and the like) or other hydroxymethylglutaryl (HMG) CoA reductase inhibitor, an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor (such as acarbose, rniglitol, voglibose and the like), a bile acid-binding resin (such as cholestyramine, celestipol and the like), a high density lipoprotein (HDL)-towering agent such as apolipoprotein A-l (apoA1), niacin and the like, probucol and nicotinic acid. In the case of inflammation, inflammatory diseases, autoimmune disease and other such cytokine mediated disorders, the additional agent(s) may be selected from the group consisting of: a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) (such as diclofenac, diflunisal, ibuprofen, naproxen and the like), a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor (such as celecoxib, rofecoxib and the like), a corticosteroid (such as prednisone, methylprednisone and the like) or other immunosuppressive agent (such as methotrexate, leflunomide, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine and the like), a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) (such as injectable gold, penicillamine, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine and the like), a TNF-alpha inhibitor (such as etanercept, infliximab and the like), other cytokine inhibitor (such as soluble cytokine receptor, anti-cytokine antibody and the like), other immune modulating agent (such as cyclosporin, tacrolimus, rapamycin and the like) and a narcotic agent (such as hydrocodone, morphine, codeine, tramadol and the like). The combination therapy<br><br>
o-oruempiated by the invention includes, for example, administration of the inventive compound and additional agent(s) in a single pharmaceutical formulation as well as administration of the inventive compound and additional agent(s) in separate pharmaceutical formulations.<br>
[000129]      Another aspect of the invention is a method of treating diabetes and related diseases comprising the step of administering to a subject-suffering from a diabetic or related condition a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formulas I -Xlil. Additionally, the invention provides a method of treating inflammation or inflammatory diseases or diseases mediated by cytokines, PDE4, PDE3, p44/42 MAP kinase, iNOS and/or COX-2 by administering to a subject in need of such treatment an effective amount of a compound according to Formulas I -XIII, Further, pharmaceutical compositions containing a therapeutically effective amount of one or more compounds according to Formulas I - XIII together with a pharmaceutical^ or physiologically acceptable carrier, for use in the treatments contemplated herein, are also provided.<br>
[000130]      The compounds of the invention are useful for the treatment of diabetes, characterized by the presence of elevated blood glucose levels, that is, hyperglycemic disorders such as diabetes mellitus, including both type 1 and 2 diabetes, as well as other hyperglycemic related disorders such as obesity, increased cholesterol, hyperlipidemia such as hypertriglyceridemia, kidney related disorders and the like. The compounds are also useful for the treatment of disorders linked to insulin resistance and/or hyperinsulinemia, which include, in addition to diabetes, hyperandrogenic conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome (Ibanez et al., J. Clin Endocrinol Metab, 85:3526-30, 2000; Taylor A.E., Obstet Gynecol Clin North Am, 27:583-95, 2000), coronary artery disease such as atherosclerosis and vascular restenosis, and peripheral vascular disease. Additionally, the compounds of the present invention are also useful for the treatment of inflammation and immunological diseases that include those mediated by signaling pathways linked to pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, and contact and atopic dermatitis.<br><br>
Lvvu-tAij       By "treatment", it is meant that the compounds of the i„*«mon are administered in an amount which is at least sufficient to, for example; reduce the blood glucose level in a patient suffering from a hyperglycemic disorder or to inhibit or prevent the development of pro-inflammatory cytokine or like responses in a patient suffering from inflammatory or immunological disease. In the case of diabetes, the compound is usually administered in the amount sufficient to reduce the blood glucose level, free fatty acid level, triglyceride level and/or the like level sufficient to improve or alleviate the symptoms and/or reduce the risk of complications associated with elevated levels of these parameters. A variety of subjects may be treated with the present compounds to reduce blood glucose levels such as livestock, wild or rare animals, pets, as well as humans. The compounds may be administered to a subject suffering from hyperglycemic disorder using any convenient administration technique, including intravenous, intradermal, intramuscular, subcutaneous, oral and the like. However, oral daily dosage is preferred. The dosage delivered to the host will necessarily depend upon the route by which the compound is delivered, but generally ranges from about 0.1 to about 500 mg/kg human body weight or typically from about 0.1 to about 50 mg/kg human body weight. Generally similar types of administration and dosages are also contemplated when the compounds of the invention are used to treat inflammatory or immunological disease.<br>
[000132]       The compounds of this invention may be used in formulations using acceptable pharmaceutical vehicles for enteral, or parenteral, administration, such as, for example, water, alcohol, gelatin, gum arabic, lactose, amylase, magnesium stearate, talc, vegetable oils, polyalkylene glycol, and the like. The compounds can be formulated in solid form, e.g., as tablets, capsules, drages and suppositories, or in the liquid form, e.g., solutions, suspensions and emulsions. The preparations may also be delivered transdermal^ or by topical application.<br>

The cell suspension was adjusted to 2.5 x 106 cells/ml in 20% FBS complete medium. Cell suspension (160 ul, 4 x 10s cells) was added into each well of a 96-well tissue-culture treated polystyrene plate and incubated at 37°C for 1 - 2.5 h. Cells were pretreated with vehicle (DMSO) or test compound (0.3,1.0, 3.0, 10 or 30 uM) in 20% FBS complete medium for 1 h at 37°C. After pretreatment, lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from Salmonella typhimurium in 20% FBS complete medium were added to the cells.

Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk, 10 mM Tris-HCI (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCI, 0.1% Tween®-20 at room temperature for 1 h and then were blotted with mAb against phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase (Thr 202/Tyr 204) at room temperature for 1 h. The membranes were then washed and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. The signals were detected using ECL Western blotting detection reagents. The results showed that<br><br>
compound 13 inhibited LPS-induced phosphorylation of p44/42 MAP kinase at 30 uM but not 10 µM, while the compound inhibited LPS/IFN-gamma induced phosphorylation of p44/42 in a dose-dependent manner at 30 uM and 10 µM (data not shown).<br>
EXAMPLE 44 Inhibition of Anti-CD3/Anti-CD28 Stimulated Lymphocyte Proliferation With a<br>
Compound of the Present Invention<br>
[000229]       Compound 13 was examined for its ability to inhibit anti-CD3/anti-CD28 stimulated lymphocyte proliferation. Binding of antigen, or antibodies, to CD3/CD28 triggers activation and proliferation of T-lymphocytes, which are key steps involved in mounting an immune response (Abbas, Lichtman and Pober, Cellular and Molecular Immunology, 3rd edition, W.B. Saunders Company, Philadelphia, 1997). Mesenteric lymph nodes were collected from BALB/c mice (female, -8 weeks old), and the cells were isolated in PBS (pH 7.4) and mixed with culture medium (RPMI 1640 medium, 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, 50 uM 2-mercaptoethanol). The cell suspension was centrifuged at 900 rpm for 10 min at room temperature using a Beckman GS-6 centrifuge with GH-3.8 rotor. After centrifugation, cell pellets were resuspended in culture medium and centrifuged again at 900 rpm for 10 min at room temperature. Cell peilets were resuspended in culture medium and cells were counted. 2 x 105 lymph node cells per well were added into a 96-well cell culture plate. For the treatment (n=4), vehicle (DMSO) or test compound was added into cells. Cells were treated with purified hamster anti-mouse CD3E (2 pg/ml) and anti-mouse CD28 (0.2 pg/ml) monoclonal antibodies or with culture medium. The final concentrations were 0.1 % DMSO and 10 uM test compound in a final volume of 200 pi per well. Cells were incubated at 37DC for 67 h, and then cells on plates were centrifuged at 900 rpm for 10 min at room temperature using a Beckman GS-6 Centrifuge with GH-3.8 rotor. 150 µl of supernatant from each well was subsequently harvested and frozen at -80°C for further analysts (ELISA). For the cells on the plate, 150 pi of culture medium was added into each well to replace the harvested supernatants and 40 pi of MTS/PMS solution was added into each well. After further incubation at 37°C for 140 min, the plate was read at 505 nm in a microplate spectrophotometer. The O.D. values (after subtracting the mean O.D. of blank wells)<br><br>
were used to compare the proliferation of treated cells. As shown in Table 5, 10 uM of compound 13 caused about 50% inhibition of the proliferation of mouse mesenteric lymph node cells stimulated by anti-CD3/anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies. Inhibition of CD3/CD28 mediated T-cell proliferation demonstrates compound 13 is able to block an immunologically-relevant cellular response, probably via interactions with a step in the signal transduction cascade. This indicates that compound 13 has immunomodulatory activity, which may be useful for the treatment of im mun op ro life rati ve disorders.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 45 Improvement of Collagen Induced Arthritis in Mice Using a Compound of the Present<br>
Invention<br>
[000230]      Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) was induced in 45 DBA/1J mice using immunization with chicken collagen Type II. The induction schedule was as follows: on Day 0,100 ug/100 ul in Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) intradermally; on Day 21,100 µg/100 µl in Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant subcutaneously; on Day 31,100 µg/100 ul in CFA subcutaneously; all given at the base of the tail. On Day 35 animals received lipopolysaccharides (detoxified from E. coli serotype 0111 :B4; 40 µg/rnL) intraperitoneally. When signs of arthritis appeared, mice were assigned into four treatment groups: vehicle control (0.5% carboxymethyicellulose (CMC)); compound 31 (40 mg/kg, suspension in CMC); compound 31 (100 mg/kg in CMC); positive control (dexamethasone; 5 mg/kg). The animals were dosed per oral by gavage, twice daily for 14 days, at a dose volume of 250 µl per mouse per dose. The study was scored blindly to the different treatment groups. Mice were weighed and arthritis was scored three times a week. Arthritis was scored as a count of affected limbs and digits, evaluated as: erythema and swelling of tarsal, the ankle to the metatarsal joints, up to restriction of movement and deformity of the joints.<br><br>
Miasma was collected from the animals 4 hours following the final dose, for measurement of circulating drug levels. At termination, animals were euthanized and hind limbs removed for histopathologic examination, hind limbs were collected in formalin. Decalcified tissue was sectioned longitudinally, parallel to the bones, and hematoxylin and eosin stained sections were scored using a standard rheumatoid arthritis scoring system by a veterinary histopathologist who was blinded to the treatment groups. Animals in ail groups had moderate arthritis prior to the start of dosing (Day 0) as shown in Figure 9. The vehicle group exhibited an increase in severity over the course of the study with a tendency to plateau from about Day 10. The low dose of compound 31 had no apparent effect on the animals compared with vehicle controls. The high dose prevented the increase in severity, to about the same extent as dexamethasone. Histology showed that the vehicle group and the low-dose compound 31 group had marked chronic inflammation of synovium with pannus formation and destruction of bone and cartilage, while in the dexamethasone group the joints were within normal limits. At high dose of compound 31 there was a reduction in incidence and severity of pannus formation, inflammation cell infiltration and bone/cartilage damage. Thus a dose-dependent effect of compound 31 was observed on both the soft tissue and bone and cartilage, consistent with a disease-modifying activity of the compound in this model.<br>
[000231]      It will be evident from the above that the compounds according to the present invention not only lower blood glucose level, triglyceride level and free fatty acid level in diabetic conditions, but also inhibit TNF-aipha, IL-6, IL-1 beta, COX-2 and iNOS production in inflammation, as well as inhibit PDE4 and PDE3 activity, phosphorylation of p44/42 MAP kinase and lymphocyte proliferation. The properties demonstrated above indicate that the compounds of the invention should be useful in the treatment of disorders associated with insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease and peripheral vascular disease and for the treatment of inflammation, inflammatory diseases, immunological diseases, proliferative diseases and cancer, especially those mediated by cytokines, cyclooxygenase, phosphodiesterase and/or MAP kinase.<br><br>

COMPOUNDS FOR TREATMENT OF INFLAMMATION, DIABETES AND<br>
RELATED DISORDERS<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
[0001]	This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application No.<br>
60/334,818, filed November 29, 2001, and is incorporated herein, in its entirety, by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	The invention is directed to compounds, for example, heterocyclic<br>
derivatives of acyl urea, thiourea, carbamate and thiocarbamate compounds, that provide a variety of useful pharmacological effects. The compounds are useful, for example, in lowering blood glucose levels in hyperglycemic disorders, such as diabetes mellitus, and for treating related disorders, such as obesity and hyperlipidemia. Furthermore, these compounds are useful for treatment of disorders associated with insulin resistance, such as polycystic ovary syndrome, and for the treatment of inflammation, inflammatory and immunological diseases, particularly those mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-6), type 4 and type 3 phosphodiesterase (PDE4 and PDE3, respectively), p44/42 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and/or inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS).<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003]	The causes of diabetes mellitus are not yet known, although both<br>
genetics and environment seem to be major factors. Type 1 diabetes, also known as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), is an autoimmune disease in which the responsible autoantigen is still unidentified. Since their insulin-producing pancreatic cells are destroyed, Type 1 diabetics need to take insulin parenterally to survive. On the other hand, type 2 diabetes, also called non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), the more common form, is a metabolic disorder resulting from the body's inability to make a sufficient amount of insulin or to properly use the insulin that is produced. Impaired insulin seer0*'""1" ar"* '■■—,;- -esistance are considered the major<br><br>
defects; however, the precise genetic factors involved in the mechanism remain unknown.<br>
[0004]	Other than insulin administered parenterally and as shown in Table 1,<br>
there are generally four major classes of oral hypoglycemic agents currently used in the treatment of diabetes mellitus:<br><br>
[0005]	As is shown in the above table, each of the current agents available for<br>
use in treatment of diabetes mellitus has several disadvantages. Accordingly, there is a need for the identification and development of new agents, particularly, water<br><br>
soluble agents which can be orally administered, for use in the treatment of diabetes mellttus and other hyperglycemic disorders.<br>
[0006]	Moreover, while the thiazolidinedione class has gained more<br>
widespread use in recent years as insulin sensitizers to combat "insulin resistance", a condition in which the patient becomes less responsive to the effects of insulin, there is a need for frequent liver testing for patients using these compounds. In fact, the known thiazolidinediones are not effective for a significant portion of the patient population. In addition, the first drug in this class to be approved by the FDA, troglitazone, was withdrawn from the market due to problems of liver toxicity. Thus, there is a continuing need for nontoxic, more widely effective insulin sensitizers.<br>
[0007]	As indicated above, the invention is also directed to the treatment of<br>
immunological diseases or inflammation, in particular, such diseases as are mediated by cytokines, COX-2 and iNOS. The principal elements of the immune system are macrophages or antigen-presenting cells, T cells and B cells. Macrophages are important mediators of inflammation and also provide the necessary "help" for T cell stimulation and proliferation. For example, macrophages make the cytokines IL-1, IL-12 and TNF-alpha, all of which are potent pro-inflammatory molecules. Cytokine production may lead to the secretion of other cytokines, altered cellular function, cell division or differentiation. In addition, activation of macrophages results in the induction of enzymes, such as GOX-2 and iNOS, and in the production of free radicals capable of damaging normal cells. Many factors activate macrophages, including bacterial products, superantigens and interferon gamma. It is believed that phosphotyrosine kinases and other cellular kinases are involved in the activation process. Since macrophages are sentinel to the development of an immune response, agents that modify their function, specifically their cytokine secretion profile, are likely to determine the direction and potency of the immune response.<br>
[0008]	Inflammation is the body's normal response to injury or infection.<br>
However, in inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, pathologic inflammatory processes can lead to morbidity and mortality. The cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) plays a central role in the inflammatory response<br><br>
and has been targeted as a point of intervention in inflammatory disease. TNF-alpha is a polypeptide hormone released by activated macrophages and other cells. At low concentrations, TNF-alpha participates in the protective inflammatory response by activating leukocytes and promoting their migration to extravascular sites of inflammation (Moser et al., J Clin Invest, 83:444-55, 1989). At higher concentrations, TNF-alpha can act as a potent pyrogen and induce the production of other pro¬inflammatory cytokines (Haworth etal., Eur J Immunol, 21:2575-79, 1991; Brennan et al., Lancet, 2:244-7,1989). TNF-alpha also stimulates the synthesis of acute-phase proteins. In rheumatoid arthritis, a chronic and progressive inflammatory disease affecting about 1% of the adult U.S. population, TNF-alpha mediates the cytokine cascade that leads to joint damage and destruction (Arend et al., Arthritis Rheum, 38:151-60, 1995). Inhibitors of TNF-alpha, including soluble TNF receptors (etanercept) (Goldenberg, Clin Ther, 21:75-87, 1999) and anti-TNF-alpha antibody (infliximab) (Luong et al., Ann Pharmacother, 34:743-60, 2000), the contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference, have recently been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as agents for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.<br>
[0009]	Elevated levels of TNF-alpha have also been implicated in many other<br>
disorders and disease conditions, including cachexia (Fong et al., Am J Physiol, 256.R659-65, 1989), septic shock syndrome (Tracey et al., Proc Soc Exp Biol Med, 200:233-9, 1992), osteoarthritis (Venn et al., Arthritis Rheum, 36:819-26, 1993), inflammatory bowel disease such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (Murch et al., Gut, 32:913-7,1991), Behcet's disease (Akoglu etal., J Rheumatol, 17:1107-8, 1990), Kawasaki disease (Matsubara et al., Clin Immunol Immunopathol, 56:29-36, 1990), cerebral malaria (Grau et al., N Engl J Med, 320:1586-91, 1989), adult respiratory distress syndrome (Millar et al„ Lancet 2:712-4, 1989), asbestosis and silicosis (Bissonnetteetal., Inflammation, 13:329-39,1989), pulmonary sarcoidosis (Baughman et al., J Lab Clin Med, 115:36-42, 1990), asthma (Shah et al., Clin Exp Allergy, 25:1038-44, 1995), AIDS (Dezube et al., J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr, 5:1099-104,1992), meningitis (Waage et al., Lancet, 1:355-7, 1987), psoriasis (Oh et al., J Am Acad Dermatol, 42:829-30, 2000), spondyloarthritides such as ankylosing spondylitis (Braun et al., Curr Opin Rheumatol 13:245-9, 2001; Marzo-Ortega et al., Arthritis Rheum 44:2112-7, 2001), graft versus host reaction (Nestel et<br><br>
al., J Exp Med, 175:405-13,1992), multiple sclerosis (Sharief et a!., N Engl J Med, 325:467-72,1991), systemic lupus erythematosus (Maury et al,, Int J Tissue React, 11:189-93, 1989), diabetes (Hotamisligil et al., Science, 259:87-91, 1993) and atherosclerosis (Bruunsgaard et al., Clin Exp Immunol, 121:255-60, 2000), the contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference. It can be seen from the references cited above that inhibitors of TNF-alpha are potentially useful in the treatment of a wide variety of diseases.<br>
[00010]        lnterleukin-6 (IL-6) is another pro-inflammatory cytokine that exhibits pleiotropy and redundancy of action. IL-6 participates in the immune response, inflammation and hematopoiesis. It is a potent inducer of the hepatic acute phase response and is a powerful stimulator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis that is under negative control by glucocorticoids. IL-6 promotes the secretion of growth hormone but inhibits release of thyroid stimulating hormone. Elevated levels of IL-6 are seen in several inflammatory diseases, and inhibition of the IL-6 cytokine subfamily has been suggested as a strategy to improve therapy for rheumatoid arthritis (Carroll et al., Infiamm Res, 47:1-7, 1998). In addition, IL-6 has been implicated in the progression of atherosclerosis and the pathogenesis of coronary heart disease (Yudkin et al., Atherosclerosis, 148:209-14, 1999). Overproduction of IL-6 is also seen in steroid withdrawal syndrome, conditions related to deregulated vasopressin secretion, and osteoporosis associated with increased bone resorption, such as in cases of hyperparathyroidism and sex-steroid deficiency (Papanicolaou et al., Ann Intern Med, 128:127-37,1998). Since excessive production of IL-6 is implicated in several disease states, it is highly desirable to develop compounds that inhibit IL-6 secretion.<br>
[00011]	The cytokine IL-1 beta also participates in the inflammatory response.<br>
It stimulates thymocyte proliferation, fibroblast growth factor activity, and the release of prostaglandin from synovial cells. Elevated or unregulated levels of the cytokine IL-1 beta have been associated with a number of inflammatory diseases and other disease states, including but not limited to adult respiratory distress syndrome (Meduri et al, Chest 107:1062-73,1995), allergy (Hastie et al, Cytokine 8:730-8, 1996), Alzheimer's disease (O'Barr et al, J Neuroimmunol 109:87-94, 2000), anorexia (Laye et al, Am J Physio!

Since overproduction of IL-1 beta is associated with numerous disease conditions, it is desirable to develop compounds that inhibit the production or activity of IL-1 beta.<br><br>
[00012]        CycloGAyycuase is an enzyme that catalyzes a rate-detei mining step in the biosynthesis of prostaglandins, which are important mediators of inflammation and pain. The enzyme occurs as at least two distinct isomers, cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). The COX-1 isomer is constitutivety expressed in the gastric mucosa, platelets and other cells and is involved in the maintenance of homeostasis in mammals, including protecting the integrity of the digestive tract. The COX-2 isomer, on the other hand, is not constitutively expressed but rather is induced by various agents, such as cytokines, mitogens, hormones and growth factors. In particular, COX-2 is induced during the inflammatory response (DeWfflDL, Biochim Biophys Acta, 1083:121-34,1991; Seibert et al., Receptor, 4:17-23, 1994.). Aspirin and other conventional non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are non-selective inhibitors of both COX-1 and COX-2. They can be effective in reducing inflammatory pain and swelling, but since they hamper the protective action of COX-1, they produce undesirable side effects of gastrointestinal pathology. Therefore, agents that selectively inhibit COX-2 but not COX-1 are preferable for treatment of inflammatory diseases. Recently, a diaryIpyrazole sulfonamide (celecoxib) that selectively inhibits COX-2 has been approved by the FDA for use in the treatment of osteoarthritis and adult rheumatoid arthritis (Luong et at., Ann Pharmacother, 34:743-60, 2000; Penning et al., J Med Chem, 40:1347-65, 1997). Another selective COX-2 inhibitor, rofecoxib, has been approved by the FDA for treatment of osteoarthritis, acute pain and primary dysmenorrhea (Scott and Lamb, Drugs, 58:499-505,1999; Morrison et al., Obstet Gynecol, 94:504-8^ 1999; Saag et al, Arch Fam Med, 9:1124-34, 2000). COX-2 is also expressed in many cancers and precancerous lesions, and there is mounting evidence that selective COX-2 inhibitors may be useful for treating and preventing colorectal, breast and other cancers (Taketo MM, J Natl Cancer Inst, 90:1609-20,1998; Fournier et al., J Cell Biochem Suppl, 34:97-102, 2000; Masferreret al., Cancer Res, 60:1306-11, 2000), the contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference. In 1999 celecoxib was approved by the FDA as an adjunct to usual care for patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, a condition which, left untreated, generally leads to colorectal cancer.<br>
[00013]	Production of nitric oxide by iNOS has been associated with both<br>
beneficial and detrimental effects in inflammation, inflammatory diseases and related<br><br>
disorders. For example, deleterious effects have been implicated in the pathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurysms (Johanning et al, J Vase Surg 33:579:86,2001), acute endotoxemia (Henntngsson et al, Am J Physiol Cell Physiol 280:01242-54, 2001), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Sasaki et al, Neurosci Lett 291:44-8, 2000), atherosclerosis (Behr-Roussel etal, Circulation 102:1033-8, 2000), bladder cancer (Wolf et al, Virchows Arch 437:662-6, 2000), colon cancer (Watanabe et al, Biofactors 12:129-33, 2QQ0), cystitis (Alfieri et al, Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol 363:353-7, 2001), HIV-1 encephalitis (Zhao et al, J Neuroimmunol 115:182-91, 2001), inflammatory bowel disease (Singer etal, Gastroenterology 111:871-85, 1996), multiple sclerosis (Pozza et al, Brain Res 855:39-46, 2000), osteoarthritis (Pelfetier et al, Osteoarthritis Cartilage 7:416-8, 1999), osteoporosis (Armour et al, J Bone Miner Res 14:2137-42, 1999), portal hypertension (Schroeder etal, Dig Dis Sci Dec45:2405-10, 2000), pulmonary edema in endotoxin shock (Lee et al, Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol 28:315-20, 2001), rheumatoid arthritis (van't Hof et al, Rheumatology (Oxford) 39:1004-8, 2000), sepsis (Nishina et al, Anesth Analg 92:959-66, 2001), severe burn/smoke inhalation injury (Soejima et al, Am J Respir Crit Care Med 163:745-52, 2001), and ulcerative colitis (Ikeda et al, Am J Gastroenterol 92:1339-41, 1997), the contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference. Since the production of nitric oxide by iNOS has been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory and related immunological diseases, it is desirable to develop compounds that inhibit iNOS activity or expression.<br>
[00014]	Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are responsible for the hydrolysis of<br>
intracellular cyclic adenosine and guanosine monophosphate (cAMP and cGMP), which converts these second messengers into their inactive forms. There are 11 major families of PDEs, designated PDE1 to PDE11. Type 4 phosphodiesterase (PDE4) is found in airway smooth muscle cells and in immune and inflammatory cells. PDE4 activity has been associated with a wide variety of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, and PDE4 inhibitors have been studied as potential therapeutic agents for such diseases as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and type 2 diabetes (Burnouf and Pruniaux, Current Pharm Des, 8:1255-96, 2002; Dal Piaz and Giovannoni, Eur J Med Chem, 35:463-80, 2000). Type 3 phosphodiesterase (PDE3) is localized in platelets and cardiac and vascular smooth muscle cells. Inhibitors of PDE3 have<br><br>
been proposed as possible drugs for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (Schermulyet al, J Pharmacol Exp Ther, 292:512-20, 2000), cancer (Shimizu et al, Anticancer Drugs, 13:875-80, 2002; Murata et al. Anticancer Drugs, 12:79-83, 2001), cardiomyopathy (Alharethi and Movsesian, Expert Opin Investig Drugs, 11:1529-36, 2002), congestive heart failure (Movsesian, J Am Col) Cardiol, 34:318-24, 1999), erectile dysfunction (Kuthe et al, CurrOpin Investig Drugs, 3:1489-95, 2002), and T-cell-mediated autoimmune disorders (Bielekova et al, J Immunol 164:1117-24, 2000), the contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[00015]        Activation of lymphocyte and macrophage immune response to pathogens involve complex intracellular signaling pathways involving a cascade of various phosphorylating enzymes, kinases that ultimately regulate cytokine production and cell apoptosis. Key kinases include p44/42 MAP kinase (also known as ERK1/ERK2), P38 MAP kinase, MEK, and IRAK/NFkB. While different processes utilize different aspects of the pathway, the bacterial coat-derived protein LPS has been shown to activate multiple mitogen-activated protein kinases, including the extracellular signal-regulated receptor kinases ERK1 and ERK2. LPS-induced TNF-alpha production by human monocytes involves activation of ERK1/ERK2 (van der Bruggen et al, Infect Immun, 67:3824-9,1999). As TNF-alpha is a key mediator of autoimmune disease, blocking the ERK pathway has potential for the treatment of inflammatory and immunological diseases such as lupus (Yi et al, J Immunol, 165:6627-34, 2000), rheumatoid arthritis (Neff et al, Cell Microbiol, 3:703-12, 2001; Schett et al, Arthritis Rheum, 43:2501-12, 2000), psoriasis (van der Bruggen et al, Infect Immun, 67:3824-9, 1999) and destruction of pancreatic islet beta cells in Type I diabetes (Pavlovic et al, Eur Cytokine Netw 11:267-74, 2000), the contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[00016]        It will be appreciated from the foregoing that, while there have been extensive prior efforts to provide compounds for inhibiting, for example, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, COX-2, PDE4 or other agents considered responsible for inflammation or inflammatory diseases, e.g. arthritis, there still remains a need for new and improved compounds for effectively treating or inhibiting such diseases. A principal object of the invention is to provide compounds which are effective for such<br><br>
treatments as well as for the treatment of, for example, diabetes, coronary heart disease, insulin resistance and related disorders.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [00017J        The invention is directed to compounds, for example, heterocyclic derivatives of acyl urea, thiourea, carbamate and thiocarbamate compounds, for providing a variety of useful pharmacological effects. The compounds are .useful, for example, in lowering blood glucose levels in hyperglycemic disorders, such as diabetes mellitus, and for treating related disorders, such as obesity and hyperlipidemia. Furthermore, these compounds are useful for treatment of disorders associated with insulin resistance, such as polycystic ovary syndrome, and for the treatment of inflammation and immunological diseases, particularly those mediated by pro-inftammatory cytokines (such as TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-6), type 4 phosphodiesterase (PDE4), type 3 phosphodiesterase (PDE3), p44/42 mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase, cyclooxygenase-2 (CQX-2) and/or inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS).

[000217]      The effect of treatment with 1 on glucose uptake was measured in 3T3-L1 differentiated adipocytes. The assay was conducted essentially according to the method ofTafuri SR, Endocrinology, 137, 4706-4712 (1996). The adipocytes were incubated with different concentrations of the test compound for 48 hours in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), then washed and incubated in glucose-free, serum-free medium for 60 minutes at 37°C. Then 14C-deoxyglucose was added and the cells were incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. After washing, the cells were lysed (0.1 % SDS) and the radioactivity was measured to determine the amount of glucose uptake. Glucose uptake was calculated as a percentage of the basal level seen in cells not<br><br>

Compounds of the Present Invention<br>
[000225]      Frozen human elutriated monocytes (Advanced Biotechnologies Incorporated) were thawed and each 1-ml vial mixed with -12 ml of 10% FBS complete medium (10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum in RPM11640 medium supplemented with 100 U/mi penicillin, 100 ug/mi streptomycin and 50 uM 2-mercaptoethanol). Cells were centrifuged at 800 rpm for 10 min at room temperature using a Beckman GS-6 centrifuge with GH-3.8 rotor, and the cell pellets were resuspended in 20% FBS complete medium (20% heat-inactivated FBS in RPM11640 medium supplemented with 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 ug/ml streptomycin and 50 uM 2-mercaptoethanol) and centrrfuged again at 800 rpm for 10 min at room temperature. Cell pellets were resuspended in 20% FBS complete medium, and the cell suspensions were pooled and passed through a 70-micron cell strainer to remove any aggregates or clumps. The cell suspension was adjusted to 2.5 x 106 cells/ml in 20% FBS complete medium. Cell suspension (160 ul, 4 x 10s cells) was added into each well of a 96-well tissue-culture treated polystyrene plate and incubated at 37°C for 1 - 2.5 h. Cells were pretreated with vehicle (DMSO) or test compound (0.3,1.0, 3.0, 10 or 30 uM) in 20% FBS complete medium for 1 h at 37°C. After pretreatment, lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from Salmonella typhimurium in 20% FBS complete medium were added to the cells. The final concentrations were 0.1% DMSO and 10 ng/ml LPS in a final volume of 200 ul/well. The cells were incubated for 20 h at 37°C, and then the supernatants were harvested and aliquots of the supernatants frozen at -80°C for subsequent analysis. Cells on the plates were assayed for cell viability using the MTS/PMS assay (Cory AH et al., Cancer Commun 3:207-212, 1991). The concentration of TNF-alpha in the cell supernatants was determined using quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay for human TNF-alpha (R&amp;D Systems). The mean percent inhibition of TNF-alpha release relative to vehicle was calculated for each concentration of test compound from multiple<br><br>
determinations. As shown in Table 2, the compounds of the invention caused significant inhibition of LPS-induced TNF-alpha release by human monocytes.<br><br><br>

Invention<br>
[000226]       Differentiation of mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes was carried out using the method of Greenberg AS, et al., J Biol Chem 276:45456-61, 2001. Briefly, 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were differentiated to adipocytes by incubation in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 72 µg/ml porcine insulin, 0.5 mM 3-isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) and 400 ng/ml dexamethasone for 2 x 48 h at 37°C. Differentiated cells were maintained in media containing 10% FBS without insulin, IBMX or dexamethasone until they were used for experiments. The effect of treatment with compounds of the invention on glucose uptake by differentiated adipocytes was assessed essentially according to the method of Tafuri SR, Endocrinology 137:4706-12, 1996. Adipocytes were incubated with vehicle {0.1 % DMSO) or test compound (0,1,1.0 or 10 uM) for 48 h in DMEM containing 10% FBS, then washed and incubated in high-glucose, serum-free medium for 3 h at 37°C. Cells were then washed, incubated for 20 min in glucose-free, serum-free medium containing 100 nM insulin, then supplemented with 2.5 uCi/ml 14C-deoxyglucose in 0.1 mM cold deoxyglucose and further incubated for<br>

As shown in Table 3, the compounds of the invention caused significant stimulation of glucose uptake in differentiated adipocytes.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 42 Inhibition of PDE4 and PDE3 Activity With a Compound of the Present Invention<br>
[000227]      Compound 13 was examined for its ability to inhibit the activity of PDE4 and PDE3 enzymes. PDE4 partially purified from human U-937 promonocyte cells and PDE3 partially purified from human platelets were used. Test compound (1,10 or 30 u.M) or vehicle (0.1% DMSO) was incubated with 0.2 ug PDE4 enzyme or 1 ug PDE3 enzyme and 1 uM cAMP containing 0.01 ug [3H]cAMP in Tris buffer pH 7.5 for 20 min at 30°C. The reaction was terminated by boiling for 2 min and the resulting AMP was converted to adenosine by addition of 10 mg/ml snake venom nucleotidase and further incubation at 30°C for 10 min. Unhydrolyzed cAMP was bound to AGI-X2 resin, and remaining [3H]adenosine in the aqueous phase was quantitated by scintillation counting. The mean percent inhibition of PDE4 or PDE3 activity was calculated from duplicate determinations (Table 4). Compound 13 exhibited significant inhibition of both PDE4 (IC50

EXAMPLE 43 Inhibition of LPS-induced Phosphorylation of p44/42 MAP Kinase With a Compound<br>
of the Present Invention<br>
[000228]      Compound 13 was examined for its ability to inhibit LPS-induced and LPS/IFN-gamma induced phosphorylation of p44/42 MAP kinase. RAW 264.7 gamma N0(-) cells were seeded at 1 x 106/well (2 ml per well) in 6-well tissue culture plates one day prior to the experiment To start the experiment, cells were washed 2X with RPMI 1640 medium, 0.5% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 ug/ml streptomycin, 1mM sodium pyruvate, and then pretreated with vehicle (0.1% DMSO) or test compound (10 or 30 uM) at 37°C for 1 h. After pretreatment, cells were incubated in RPMI 1640 medium, 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 ug/ml streptomycin, 1mM sodium pyruvate, containing 10 ng/ml LPS or LPS (10 ng/ml)/lFN-gamma (10 U/ml) at 37°C for 15 min. Cells were then washed 2X with cold PBS (pH 7.4) and lysed in 20 mM Tris-HC! (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCI, 1 mM Na2EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM beta-glycerophosphate, 1 mM Na3V04.1 ug/ml teupeptin, 1 mM PMSF on ice for 10 min. Lysed cells were collected and centrifuged at -20,800 x g for 10 min at 4°C. Supematants (lysates) were collected, aliquoted, and stored frozen at -S0DC until use. Lysates {29 pg of total proteins per sample) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide (4-20%) gel electrophoresis, and the separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk, 10 mM Tris-HCI (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCI, 0.1% Tween®-20 at room temperature for 1 h and then were blotted with mAb against phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase (Thr 202/Tyr 204) at room temperature for 1 h. The membranes were then washed and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. The signals were detected using ECL Western blotting detection reagents. The results showed that<br><br>
compound 13 inhibited LPS-induced phosphorylation of p44/42 MAP kinase at 30 uM but not 10 µM, while the compound inhibited LPS/IFN-gamma induced phosphorylation of p44/42 in a dose-dependent manner at 30 uM and 10 µM (data not shown).<br>
EXAMPLE 44 Inhibition of Anti-CD3/Anti-CD28 Stimulated Lymphocyte Proliferation With a<br>
Compound of the Present Invention<br>
[000229]       Compound 13 was examined for its ability to inhibit anti-CD3/anti-CD28 stimulated lymphocyte proliferation. Binding of antigen, or antibodies, to CD3/CD28 triggers activation and proliferation of T-lymphocytes, which are key steps involved in mounting an immune response (Abbas, Lichtman and Pober, Cellular and Molecular Immunology, 3rd edition, W.B. Saunders Company, Philadelphia, 1997). Mesenteric lymph nodes were collected from BALB/c mice (female, -8 weeks old), and the cells were isolated in PBS (pH 7.4) and mixed with culture medium (RPMI 1640 medium, 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, 50 uM 2-mercaptoethanol). The cell suspension was centrifuged at 900 rpm for 10 min at room temperature using a Beckman GS-6 centrifuge with GH-3.8 rotor. After centrifugation, cell pellets were resuspended in culture medium and centrifuged again at 900 rpm for 10 min at room temperature. Cell peilets were resuspended in culture medium and cells were counted. 2 x 105 lymph node cells per well were added into a 96-well cell culture plate. For the treatment (n=4), vehicle (DMSO) or test compound was added into cells. Cells were treated with purified hamster anti-mouse CD3E (2 pg/ml) and anti-mouse CD28 (0.2 pg/ml) monoclonal antibodies or with culture medium. The final concentrations were 0.1 % DMSO and 10 uM test compound in a final volume of 200 pi per well. Cells were incubated at 37DC for 67 h, and then cells on plates were centrifuged at 900 rpm for 10 min at room temperature using a Beckman GS-6 Centrifuge with GH-3.8 rotor. 150 µl of supernatant from each well was subsequently harvested and frozen at -80°C for further analysts (ELISA). For the cells on the plate, 150 pi of culture medium was added into each well to replace the harvested supernatants and 40 pi of MTS/PMS solution was added into each well. After further incubation at 37°C for 140 min, the plate was read at 505 nm in a microplate spectrophotometer. The O.D. values (after subtracting the mean O.D. of blank wells)<br><br>
were used to compare the proliferation of treated cells. As shown in Table 5, 10 uM of compound 13 caused about 50% inhibition of the proliferation of mouse mesenteric lymph node cells stimulated by anti-CD3/anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies. Inhibition of CD3/CD28 mediated T-cell proliferation demonstrates compound 13 is able to block an immunologically-relevant cellular response, probably via interactions with a step in the signal transduction cascade. This indicates that compound 13 has immunomodulatory activity, which may be useful for the treatment of im mun op ro life rati ve disorders.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 45 Improvement of Collagen Induced Arthritis in Mice Using a Compound of the Present<br>
Invention<br>
[000230]      Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) was induced in 45 DBA/1J mice using immunization with chicken collagen Type II. The induction schedule was as follows: on Day 0,100 ug/100 ul in Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) intradermally; on Day 21,100 µg/100 µl in Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant subcutaneously; on Day 31,100 µg/100 ul in CFA subcutaneously; all given at the base of the tail. On Day 35 animals received lipopolysaccharides (detoxified from E. coli serotype 0111 :B4; 40 µg/rnL) intraperitoneally. When signs of arthritis appeared, mice were assigned into four treatment groups: vehicle control (0.5% carboxymethyicellulose (CMC)); compound 31 (40 mg/kg, suspension in CMC); compound 31 (100 mg/kg in CMC); positive control (dexamethasone; 5 mg/kg). The animals were dosed per oral by gavage, twice daily for 14 days, at a dose volume of 250 µl per mouse per dose. The study was scored blindly to the different treatment groups. Mice were weighed and arthritis was scored three times a week. Arthritis was scored as a count of affected limbs and digits, evaluated as: erythema and swelling of tarsal, the ankle to the metatarsal joints, up to restriction of movement and deformity of the joints.<br><br>
Miasma was collected from the animals 4 hours following the final dose, for measurement of circulating drug levels. At termination, animals were euthanized and hind limbs removed for histopathologic examination, hind limbs were collected in formalin. Decalcified tissue was sectioned longitudinally, parallel to the bones, and hematoxylin and eosin stained sections were scored using a standard rheumatoid arthritis scoring system by a veterinary histopathologist who was blinded to the treatment groups. Animals in ail groups had moderate arthritis prior to the start of dosing (Day 0) as shown in Figure 9. The vehicle group exhibited an increase in severity over the course of the study with a tendency to plateau from about Day 10. The low dose of compound 31 had no apparent effect on the animals compared with vehicle controls. The high dose prevented the increase in severity, to about the same extent as dexamethasone. Histology showed that the vehicle group and the low-dose compound 31 group had marked chronic inflammation of synovium with pannus formation and destruction of bone and cartilage, while in the dexamethasone group the joints were within normal limits. At high dose of compound 31 there was a reduction in incidence and severity of pannus formation, inflammation cell infiltration and bone/cartilage damage. Thus a dose-dependent effect of compound 31 was observed on both the soft tissue and bone and cartilage, consistent with a disease-modifying activity of the compound in this model.<br>
[000231]      It will be evident from the above that the compounds according to the present invention not only lower blood glucose level, triglyceride level and free fatty acid level in diabetic conditions, but also inhibit TNF-aipha, IL-6, IL-1 beta, COX-2 and iNOS production in inflammation, as well as inhibit PDE4 and PDE3 activity, phosphorylation of p44/42 MAP kinase and lymphocyte proliferation. The properties demonstrated above indicate that the compounds of the invention should be useful in the treatment of disorders associated with insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease and peripheral vascular disease and for the treatment of inflammation, inflammatory diseases, immunological diseases, proliferative diseases and cancer, especially those mediated by cytokines, cyclooxygenase, phosphodiesterase and/or MAP kinase.<br><br>
