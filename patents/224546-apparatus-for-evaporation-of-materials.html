APPLIED MATERIALS GMBH &amp; CO. KG<br>
GERMAN Company<br>
SIEMENSSTRASSE 100,<br>
D-63755 ALZENAU<br>
GERMANY<br><br>
PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br>
In vacuum coating technology vaporizers are required in order to vaporize materials, for example metals, and to provide substrates with a material coating. The substrates can involve films, webs and the like (cf. DE 195 27 604 A1, DE 43 10 085 A1, DE 42 23 568 C1, DE 42 03 632 C2, DE 102 24 908 Al). As a rule, the vaporizer comprises a vaporization crucible containing the material to be vaporized. Above the vaporizer crucible can be provided a nozzle bar formed of a metal profile slotted in the longitudinal direction. The nozzle opening formed by the slot ensures that the vaporized material emanating from the vaporizer crucible is uniformly deposited onto the substrate located directly in front of the nozzle opening. The heating elements are here heating coils (DE 38 17 513 C2). As the heating element for heating the material in a vaporizer boat or crucible, it is also possible to utilize a graphite foil provided with slots, which form a meander band about the crucible (WO 00/46418).<br>
In another vapor deposition arrangement for vacuum vaporization installations an electric heating rod is provided as the heating element (DE 198 43 818 Al).<br>
A high vacuum coating installation is furthermore known, in which material is vaporized by means of high current and, for the generation of the high current, at least one transformer with an iron core, a primary winding and a secondary winding is provided, whose secondary winding is connected to the material to be vaporized or to the crucible to be heated (DE 42 09 334 C2, US 2 664 853).<br>
Lastly, an arrangement is also known for regulating the vaporizer rate of crucibles, which are heated by current throughflow and from which metal is vaporized (DE 44 04 550 C2). In this arrangement the total resistance composed of the electric resistance of a crucible and the electric resistance of the metal, disposed in the crucible and to be vaporized, is regulated to a specific value.<br>
Most of the known vaporizers have only one heating circuit leading to poor regulatability of the vaporizer performance. In addition, as an expendable part the nozzle bar is deformed during operation, which necessitates a predeformation with each exchange of the nozzle bar.<br><br>
The object of the invention is to increase the regulatability of the vaporizer performance.<br>
The invention consequently relates to an arrangement for vaporizing materials with a vaporizer crucible, in which is disposed the material to be vaporized. About the vaporizer crucible is placed a vaporizer tube, which - viewed in the longitudinal direction of the vaporizer tube - comprises at least two heating circuits, spatially disposed one behind the other, which can be electrically controlled separately from one another, each of these heating circuits comprising at least two heating subcircuits, one of which is disposed on one side of the vaporizer tube and one on the other side of the vaporizer tube. The vaporizer tube is provided with a top portion, which has its own heating circuit.<br>
The advantage attained with the invention comprises that the nozzle bar is substantially less prone to failure and the exchange of the nozzle bar is simplified. The vaporizer tube is additionally heated more uniformly in its longitudinal direction. The vaporizer performance is furthermore well regulatable and the current-carrying heating coils do not form undesirable plasmas.<br>
An embodiment example of the invention is depicted in the drawing and be described in the following in further detail. In the drawing depict:<br>
Fig. 1	a portion of a web coating installation for seating a vaporizer,<br>
Fig. 2	a perspective view of a partially open vaporizer,<br>
Fig. 3	an illustration of three heating subcircuits on one side of a vaporizer,<br>
Fig. 4	a cross section through the vaporizer according to fig. 3.<br>
In fig. 1 is depicted a portion of a web coating installation. This portion comprises a seating for a vaporizer, which is formed by three walls 1,2,3. The walls 1 and 3 extend parallel, while the wall 2 forms a bottom. Above the seating with the three walls 1,2,3 is disposed a part 4 over which, during operation of the installation, runs a cylinder guiding a web or a film. The surface of part 4 is therefore implemented arcuate in adaptation to the, not shown, cylinder.<br>
Between walls 1,3, and resting on the bottom, a vaporizer 5 is introduced, which is not further shown in fig. 2.<br>
In this vaporizer 5 shown in fig. 2 a side covering 6 is folded away, such that one side of<br><br>
the vaporizer tube 7 is exposed. It is evident that the exposed side of the vaporizer tube 7 comprises two heating subdrcuits 8,9. To these heating subdrcuits correspond on the opposite side of the vaporizer tube 7 two further heating subdrcuits, which are not visible in fig. 2. Heating subdrcuit 8 forms with the nonvisible heating subdrcuit on the opposite side of the vaporizer tube 7 a first heating circuit, while heating subdrcuit 9 forms a second heating circuit with the opposite hidden heating subdrcuit. The heating subdrcuits of a heating circuit are electrically conneded in parallel. A heating subdrcuit can, in turn, be comprised of one or more heating conducting leads. Each of the heating subdrcuits 8,9 depided in fig. 2 has two heating conducting leads.<br>
A third heating circuit 10 is located at the top portion 11 of vaporizer tube 7.<br>
Further details of the disposition of the heating condudors are evident in the simplified illustration of fig. 3.<br>
In this fig. 3 can be seen the front heating subdrcuit 8 and the rear heating subdrcuit 9. In contrast to fig. 2, each of the heating subdrcuits 8,9, for the sake of clarity, comprises only one heating conducting lead. A heating condudor 49 starts at a plug terminal 12 and leads via the heating condudor segments 13 to 17 to a connection to ground 18.<br>
The essentially not visible heating condudor 19 disposed on the opposite side, also starts at plug terminal 12 and is subsequently hidden behind the vaporizer tube 7. This heating condudor subsequently becomes visible again as heating condudor segment 20 and terminates at ground connection 21. Therewith the first heating circuit becomes a closed circuit.<br>
The second heating circuit is comprised of the rear heating subdrcuit 9 and the substantially not visible heating subdrcuit on the other side of the vaporizer tube 7. The heating subdrcuit 9 starts at a plug terminal 22 and leads via heating condudor segments 23 to 28 to a ground connection 29. The substantially not visible heating subdrcuit also starts at plug terminal 22 and leads via heating condudor segments 30,31 behind the vaporizer tube 7 and subsequently becomes visible again as heating condudor segments 32, 33 and leads to a ground connection 34.<br>
The third heating circuit 10 is located at the top portion 11 of the vaporizer tube 7. It comprises a first heating condudor with the heating conductor segments 35 to 37, conneded to a plug terminal 40, and parallel to the heating condudor segment 37 and behind the top portion 11 a return heating condudor segment is provided, which is connected with a ground connection 39 via the heating condudor segment 38.<br><br>
Connected to the same plug terminal 40 is a second heating conductor with the heating conductor segments 41 to 43 and with a return heating conductor segment, not visible behind the top portion 11, which is connected via the heating conductor segment 44 with the ground connection 39.<br>
A third heating conductor, a component of heating circuit 10, is also connected to plug terminal 40 and leads via its heating conductor segments 45 to 48 to ground connection 39. The heating conductor segment 48 is here a portion of a heating conductor segment extending behind the top portion 11. By 72, 73, 74 are denoted terminal strips, while 70 denotes a base plate and 71 are insulation plates.<br>
All three heating conductors forming the heating circuit 10 are electrically connected in parallel.<br>
As described earlier, the heating subcircuits shown in fig. 2 comprise twice as many heating conductors as the heating subcircuits according to fig. 3.<br>
In fig. 4 is shown an enlarged section A-A through the vaporizer tube 7 and the top portion 11 according to fig. 3. Evident are here the heating conductor segments 15,14,13 and 17,50 to 52 and 20 of die first heating circuit.<br>
The heating conductor segments 37,43,47,53 to 55 form the third heating circuit. Between the heating conductor segments 53 and 37 is disposed a nozzle bar 59 with a nozzle 60. Through this nozzle 60 the vaporized material is delivered onto a web 61 to be coated, which is guided via rollers 62,63.<br>
The second heating circuit is not visible in fig. 4.<br>
In the vaporizer tube 7 is located a crucible 56, in which is disposed a material 57 to be vaporized.<br>
In the upper region of the vaporizer tube 7 is provided a longitudinal slot 64.<br>
The vaporizer tube 7 and the top portion 11 can be encompassed by laminated insulation sheet in order to bring about thermal insulation.<br>
The coating of the web 61 takes place such that the material 57 in crucible 56 disposed in vaporizer tube 7 is heated such that it vaporizes and through the slot 64 and nozzle 60<br><br>
reaches web 61.<br>
Consequently, the invention provides three or more regulatable heating circuits. One heating circuit ensures the desired temperature of the nozzle bar, which is independent of the temperature of the vaporizer tube. At least two further regulatable heating circuits are provided for the longitudinal distribution of the temperature in the vaporizer tube.<br>
The heating conductors utilized are so-called jacket heating conductors, which are comprised of an electrically well conducting core, an insulation layer encompassing the latter, and a metal shell encompassing the insulation layer. The individual heating circuits are comprised of several heating conductors.<br><br>
