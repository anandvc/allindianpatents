				<td>DISPENSING MACHINE FOR PREPARING BEVERAGES<br>
Technical Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to the preparation of beverages such as<br>
coffee, tea, cappuccino and hot chocolate and in particular to a machine for<br>
preparing these beverages.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Prior art machines connected to the water mains generally comprise tanks<br>
containing soluble products, mixing chambers to mix water with a soluble<br>
product or with a mixture of soluble products, dispensing ducts that connect the<br>
tanks to the mixing chambers and the latter to the dispensing nozzle, a special<br>
unit for espresso coffee, at least one solenoid valve to control delivery of water<br>
to the mixing chamber, metering means to meter the exact quantity of soluble<br>
product required to obtain a specific beverage and a suction cleaner to clean,<br>
after each beverage is dispensed, the dispensing ducts and the mixing<br>
chambers from any residue that may deposit.<br>
In prior art machines, the components or parts listed above and others<br>
not mentioned, are mounted with the exception of the tanks for soluble<br>
products in a specific compartment and, in order to restrict the overall<br>
dimensions of the machine, they are placed in close contact with one another or<br>
superimposed, making it practically impossible to gain access to a part from the<br>
front to perform regular or special maintenance operations without having to<br>
remove the superimposed parts / or some adjacent parts.<br>
Although making it possible to produce a compact dispensing machine,<br>
the particular arrangement of the parts inside the machine makes it difficult to<br>
access the various parts to perform maintenance<br>
operations or to inspect them. In fact, when the dispensing machine \s<br>
installed in a public place even the smallest adjustment requires<br>
disassembly and subsequent reassembly of one or more components<br>
or parts, resulting in an increase in working times and hence in directly<br>
related costs or requires access from the rear of the machine, which is<br>
somewhat impractical.<br>
To solve this problem machines have been supplied equipped<br>
with the coffee unit, that is the unit that by grinding the coffee beans<br>
and subsequent known operations makes it possible to dispense<br>
espresso coffee, provided with runners sliding in specific guides<br>
produced on the frame of the machine to allow extraction, as if it<br>
were a drawer, of the entire unit with respect to the machine.<br>
However, a machine of this type only allows simple extraction of<br>
the coffee unit, without however providing easy access to the<br>
remaining parts constituting the machine.<br>
The object of the present invention is to solve the drawbacks of<br>
prior art, by providing a machine for distributing beverages obtained<br>
from soluble products the structure of which allows, internally,<br>
ergonomic distribution of the component parts so that the different<br>
parts may be accessed without necessarily having to disassemble the<br>
entire machine.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
These objects are attained by the present invention, which<br>
relates to a machine for preparing beverages of the type provided<br>
with a hollow frame comprising a water feed unit and an assembly for<br>
preparing beverages formed of a plurality of components, said<br>
components being disposed in a compartment closed at the front by<br>
a supporting element for at least one mixing chamber and at least<br>
one dispensing nozzle, characterized in that the components of said<br>
assembly for preparing beverages are supported entirely or in part by<br>
said supporting element and in that said supporting element is<br>
removably mounted with respect to said compartment.<br>
An arrangement of this kind allows some components of the<br>
assembly for preparing beverages to be supported on the supporting<br>
element increasing the free space on the internal walls of the frame.<br>
This increases accessibility to those components of the machine<br>
directly attached to the fixed walls of the frame.<br>
Moreover, the fact that the supporting element can be<br>
removed further facilitates access to those components directly<br>
attached to it.<br>
According to an advantageous aspect of the present invention,<br>
the supporting element comprises a supporting plate hinged on one<br>
of its sides to the hollow frame and designed to rotate between a<br>
position in which, together with the fixed elements of the frame, it<br>
defines a closed compartment and an overturned position in which it<br>
defines an open compartment. The supporting plate mounted to<br>
overturn considerably increases the constructional simplicity of the<br>
machine and significantly decreases the adjustment times, during<br>
inspection, of the machine. In fact, instead of partial disassembly of<br>
the machine, a simple manual operation by the operator is all that is<br>
required to gain access to any of its components.<br>
According to a preferred aspect of the present invention, the<br>
assembly for preparing beverages comprises at least one pump, at<br>
least one water volume measuring device, at least one boiler and at<br>
least one solenoid valve to control delivery of water to said at least<br>
one mixing chamber.<br>
According to another preferred aspect of the present invention,<br>
the assembly for preparing beverages also comprises a unit for<br>
preparing espresso coffee supported on the supporting plate.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
Further characteristics and advantages of the present invention<br>
shall become more apparent from the description hereunder,<br>
provided purely as a non-limiting example with reference to the<br>
schematic accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 is an internal perspective view of an embodiment of the<br>
beverage dispensing machine according to the present invention with<br>
the supporting element in the closed position;<br>
Figure 2 is an internal perspective view of an embodiment of the<br>
beverage dispensing machine according to the present invention with<br>
the supporting element in the open or overturned position;<br>
Figure 3 is an internal perspective view of an alternative<br>
embodiment of the beverage dispensing machine according to the<br>
present invention with the supporting element in the closed position;<br>
and<br>
Figure 4 is a perspective view of the embodiment in figure 2 with<br>
the supporting element in the open position.<br>
Modes for carrying out the Invention<br>
Figure 1 represents a possible embodiment of a machine for<br>
preparing beverages according to the present invention.<br>
In particular, figure 1 shows the hollow frame 1 open, that is<br>
without the front covering element, of a machine for preparing<br>
beverages according to the present invention.<br>
The hollow frame 1 comprises, in a known way, a water feed unit<br>
and an assembly for preparing beverages formed of a plurality of<br>
components contained in a specific compartment 4, closed at the<br>
front, as shown in figure 1, by a supporting element 5 for the mixing<br>
chambers 6 and the dispensing nozzle 7.<br>
The water feed unit connected to the water mains is constituted<br>
by a solenoid valve to control the delivery of water to the system and<br>
by a water level control unit 8 that guarantees a minimum level of<br>
water in the system. While the elements constituting the water feed<br>
unit are attached to the internal walls of the hollow frame 1, the<br>
elements constituting the assembly for preparing beverages are fixed<br>
to the supporting element 5. The supporting element 5 is constituted<br>
by a supporting plate removably mounted with respect to the<br>
compartment 4 of the frame.<br>
In other words, the supporting plate 5 may be detached from<br>
the compartment 4 of the frame to be removed.<br>
The supporting plate 5 is connected to the frame 1 by means<br>
constituting a hinge to allow it to rotate with respect to one side of the<br>
same as if it were a flap. The means constituting the hinges around<br>
which the plate 5 rotates may be represented, for example, by pins<br>
disposed on one side of the plate 5 and engaged, in a removable<br>
way, in specific circular seats (not shown) made on the frame 1 or by<br>
other known means. In the embodiment shown in figure 2, the<br>
supporting plate 5 hinged on the bottom side rotates downward with<br>
respect to it, although, without departing from the scope of protection<br>
of the present invention, it is also possible to provide hinging means<br>
that allow upward rotation, that is hinging means that allow the<br>
supporting plate to rotate with respect to its top side.<br>
In detail, the supporting plate 5 can rotate between a position in<br>
which in combination with other fixed elements of the frame 1 it<br>
constitutes a closed compartment 4, as shown in figure 1, to contain<br>
components of the assembly for preparing beverages and a position<br>
in which it defines an open compartment 4 as shown in figure 2.<br>
The fixed elements of the frame designed to define the<br>
containing compartment 4 are represented by two fixed plates 10, 11<br>
disposed crosswise with respect to the frame 1, one top and one<br>
bottom, and by the rear 12 and side 13 walls of the same frame.<br>
In the embodiment shown in figures 1 and 2 the assembly for<br>
preparing beverages is constituted by a pump controlled by a water<br>
volume measuring device (not directly visible) designed to meter the<br>
quantity of water required to prepare a particular beverage, from a<br>
boiler (not directly visible) responsible for heating the water and by a<br>
solenoid valve 14 for each mixing chamber 6. All the components of<br>
the assembly, that is the boiler, the solenoid valves 14 and the pump,<br>
are supported on the supporting plate 5 and therefore simply by<br>
rotating this plate they become accessible to an operator entrusted<br>
with their maintenance or adjustment. Alternatively, without departing<br>
from the scope of protection of the present invention, it is possible to<br>
only partly fix the components of the assembly for preparing<br>
beverages to the supporting plate 5. In other words, it is possible to fix<br>
only some of the components of the assembly, such as the solenoid<br>
valves and the boiler, to the plate 5 and the remaining components to<br>
a side wall of the frame 1.<br>
The assembly for preparing beverages is connected in a known<br>
way, via ducts not shown, to the storage tanks 17 of the soluble<br>
products which, as shown in figure 2, are disposed at the top end of<br>
the frame 1 and are fastened to it.<br>
The mixing chambers 6 may also be equipped with specific<br>
blenders, not directly shown, to facilitate mixing the soluble product<br>
with the water.<br>
As mentioned previously, the supporting plate 5 may be<br>
detached from the compartment 4 of the frame. For this purpose, for<br>
example according to an alternative embodiment, the supporting<br>
plate 5 may be provided with two side guides designed to slide in<br>
specific tracks disposed on the internal frame 1 of the machine to<br>
make its extraction possible, as if it were a drawer, with respect to the<br>
compartment 4.<br>
Figures 3 and 4 shows an alternative embodiment of the<br>
machine according to the present invention and in particular a<br>
machine in which the assembly for preparing beverages, in addition<br>
to the components listed above, also comprises another unit 18 for<br>
preparing espresso coffee. As well as preparing beverages from<br>
soluble products, an embodiment of this kind also allows espresso<br>
coffee to be made. The unit 18 for preparing espresso coffee, as<br>
shown in figure 4, is equipped with a grinder 19 operated by an<br>
electric motor 20 to grind the coffee beans and is supported, as shown<br>
in figure 4, on the supporting plate 5.<br>
Therefore, also in this embodiment all the components for<br>
preparing beverages are supported on the supporting plate 5<br>
designed to rotate around one of its sides. As previously illustrated,<br>
rotation of the supporting plate, indicated in figure 4 by the arrow F,<br>
allows an operator entrusted with their maintenance to access all the<br>
components. It is also possible to detach the plate 5 from the hollow<br>
frame 1, after disconnecting some ducts, not shown, to gain access to<br>
the components of the assembly for preparing beverages or to the<br>
components of the water feed unit mounted fixed on the walls of the<br>
hollow frame 1.<br>
The machines for preparing beverages illustrated above also<br>
have all the parts, such as connection pipes and safety valves, not<br>
specifically mentioned in this description, that are normally found in<br>
similar machines.<br>
Various modifications may be made without departing from the<br>
scope of the present invention. For example, the supporting element<br>
or plate 5 may be made of two adjacent plates hinged separately to<br>
the hollow frame 5. In this case, one plate will support, for example,<br>
the coffee unit 18 and one plate will support all or part of the<br>
remaining components of the assembly for preparing beverages.<br>
