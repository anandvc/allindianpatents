The present invention relates to the field of Biochemistry more particularly to compositions and methods for preparing Metal Amino Acid Chelates having a nutritionally relevant Anion Radical (s).<br>
This invention lays emphasis on formation of metal alpha amino acid chelate, wherein the primary valency, if any and secondary valency of the metal is satisfied by amino acid(s) and normally highly soluble quarternary ammonium salt formed by the coordinate covalent bonding of the 'N' of amino acid group with nutritionally relevant anion radical(s).<br>
This invention also includes chelates formed with the charge on the metal ion being neutralized by amino acid(s) along with negatively charged elements / groups, the resultant products forming quarternary ammonium complex with nutritionally relevant anion radical(s) as mentioned above.<br>
It has been a major aim of the nutritionists and scientists to identify a source of mineral supplementation which is best bioabsorbed. The quantity of mineral supplementation of the best bioabsorbed mineral would be at a dosage which is just what the body requires thus vastly helping in reducing toxicity.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
There are two patent documents which are opined to be closely related to the present invention, the details of which is hereby incorporated by way of reference.<br>
US5516935 describes an invention relates to amino acid chelated mineral compositions containing amino acid ligands which have improved palatability. This patent claims the compositions wherein the central metal is bonded to unidentate or polydendate ligands. The ligands are generally selected from alpha amino acids and    hydroxy substituted acids. However, there is no<br><br>
mention of inorganic ions that are nutritionally relevant forming part of the molecule .<br>
In another publicationWO03016332 a method was claimed of enhancing the solubility of iron amino acid chelates and iron proteinates comprising admixing an effective amount of an organic acid solubilizing agent with an iron amino acid chelate or iron proteinate having a ligand to metal molar ratio from about 1: 1 to 4M. This disclosure does not at all specify the exchange of acid radicals and is silent about using inorganic acid radicals forming a part of the molecule.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Metal amino acid chelate having nutritionally relevant anion radical(s) is prepared by reacting a metal Amino Acid Hydroxide Chelate or Metal Amino Acid Salt Chelate with a nutritionally relevant acid radical in a suitable mole ratio such that the new chelate formed has the metal Amino Acid structure is unchanged but is bonded to a nutritionally relevant Anion Radical obtained by ionic dissociation of a nutritionally Relevant acid or its salts and esters.<br>
Amino Acid Chelates having a nutritionally relevant anion radical are those chelates which have the metal obtained from either an inorganic or organic source linked to the Amino Acid having a positive charge and the Nutritionally relevant Radical having the negative charge when ionized. The metal amino acid chelates of the present invention have a amino acid to metal to Nutritionally relevant Acid Radical in a molar ratio from 1:1:1 to 4:1:2.<br>
OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION :<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a chelated mineral composition containing the nutritionally relevant anion radicals) that forms a quarternary ammonium complex with (N' of the alpha amino acid(s) thereby resulting in an increased bio availability of the metal, amino acid(s) and nutritionally relevant anion radical(s).<br><br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a mineral in a form such that it is best bioabsorbed. It is also an object of the invention to provide a mineral which has an improved stability resulting in an increased shelf life of the food/feed supplement to which they are incorporated.<br>
It is also the object of the invention to provide the mineral in a manner that it does not exhibit its characteristic metallic flavour or after taste such that it is favourably used in food supplements, beverages, tablets and as a supplement in any food /feed ingredients.<br>
It is also another object of the invention to provide a chelated mineral composition containing the nutritionally relevant anion radicals) such that the metal, amino acid and nutritionally relevant anion radical(s) are in the most stable forms and do not accelerate oxidation / rancidity to the supplement / food products to which they are added, thereby increasing the shelf life of food / feed supplement.<br>
Minerals used for chelation could be obtained from both organic or inorganic sources.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Before the present invention is disclosed and described, it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to the particular process steps and materials disclosed herein because such process steps and materials may vary somewhat It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is used for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only.<br>
It must be noted that, as used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms "a," "an," and "the" include plural referents unless the content clearly dictates therewise.<br><br>
In contrast to the above patent disclosures the present invention is related to the metal amino acid chelates having nutritionally relevant anion and the method of preparation of the same wherein the desired inorganic anions and such other organic anions such as FOLATE etc., which are not covered under the above said references forms part of the molecule claimed herein.<br>
The words, "NUTRITIONALLY RELEVANT ANION", wherever used in the present description and in the appended claims should be understood that it refers to the anions required by the body to carryout the metabolic reactions. And similarly the words, "NATURALLY OCCURING ORGANIC ACID", wherever used herein should be construed that the anions used in the present invention are derived from the organic acids available in nature either in free form or in any acid derivative forms. The examples for naturally occurring organic acids can be referred to citric acid, tartaric acid, folic acid etc., but it also should be understood that all the naturally occurring acids are within the scope of the invention and there is no limitation to it.<br>
Amino acid chelates are generally produced by the reaction between .alpha.-amino acids and metal ions having a valency of two or more to form a ring structure. In such a reaction, the positive electrical charge of the metal ion is neutralized by the electrons available through the carboxylate or free amino groups of the .alpha.-amino acid.<br>
Traditionally, the term "chelate" has been loosely defined as a combination of a metallic ion bonded to one or more amino acids forming heterocyclic ring structures. Under this definition, chelate formation through neutralization of the positive charges of the metal ions may be through the formation of ionic, covalent, or coordinate covalent bonding.<br>
A chelate is a definite structure resulting from precise requirement of synthesis. Proper conditions must be present for chelation to take place, including proper mole ratios of amino acids to metal ions, pH, temperature, solubility of reactants and proper catalysts. For chelation to occur, all components are generally dissolved in solution and are either ionized or of<br><br>
appropriate electronic configuration in order for coordinate covalent bonding and/or ionic bonding between the amino acid and the metal ion to occur.<br>
Chelation can be confirmed and differentiated from mixtures of components by infrared spectra through comparison of the stretching of bonds or shifting of absorption caused by bond formation.<br>
The product, referred to as an "amino acid chelate," when properly formed, is a stable product having one or more five-membered rings formed by a reaction between the carboxyl oxygen, and the .alpha.-amino group of an .alpha.-amino acid with the metal or metal ion having a positive charge and an nutritionally relevant radical with a negative charge. Such a five-membered ring is defined by the metal atom / ion, the carboxyl oxygen, the carbonyl carbon, the alpha carbon and the .alpha.-amino nitrogen. During the formation of ring structure, the alpha amino nitrogen denotes a lone pair to the metal ion. The actual structure of the cation will depend upon the amino acid to metal mole ratio and whether the carboxyl oxygen forms a coordinate covalent bond or an ionic bond with the metal ion. Generally, the amino acid to metal molar ratio is at least 1:1 and is preferably 2:1 or 3:1. However, in certain instances, the ratio may be 4:1. Most typically, an amino acid chelate may be represented at a amino acid to metal molar ratio of 2:1. In all the cases the nutritionally relevant anion radicals are formed from an acid with a stoichmetry of atleast one mole, typically two moles and in rare cases upto four moles. The structure of the Metal amino acid chelate having nutritionally relevant anion radical is presented below.<br>
(i)       Amino acid to metal to nutritionally relevant anion radical molar ratio of 1:1:1<br><br><br><br>
iii) Amino acid to metal to nutritionally relevant anion radical molar ratio of<br>
2:1:2<br>
	 ■ #-*<br>
In the above structure, the solid lines represent coordinate covalent bonds and covalent bonds. The dashed lines between the alpha.-amino group and the metal (M) represent the weak bond. Further, when R is H, the amino acid is glycine which is the simplest of the .alpha.-amino acids. However, R could be a radical forming any other of the other twenty or so naturally occurring amino acids derived from proteins. All of the amino acids have the same configuration for the positioning of the carboxyl oxygen and the .alpha.-amino nitrogen with respect to the metal ion. In other words, the chelate ring is defined by the same atoms with respect to all alpha amino acids in each instance,        even        though        the        R        group        may        vary.<br>
The average molecular weight of the hydrolyzed Protein and / or amino acids must be approximately 150 and the resulting molecular weight of the chelate must not exceed 800.<br>
It was also surprisingly found that there existing a weak bond between the metal and quaternary alpha amino nitrogen.<br><br>
The reason a metal atom / ion can accept bonds over and above the oxidation state of the metal is due to the nature of chelation. For example, at the .alpha.-amino group of an amino acid, the nitrogen contributes both of the electrons used in the bonding. These electrons fill available spaces in the d-orbitals forming a coordinate covalent bond. Thus, a metal ion with a normal valency of +2 can be bonded by four bonds when fully chelated.<br>
It has been well established that metals extracted from organic sources than those obtained from inorganic sources have better bioabsorbability . Thus the metals referred to in this application refer to those obtained from both organic and inorganic sources.<br>
In this state, the chelate is completely satisfied by the bonding electrons and the charge on the metal atom (as well as on the overall molecule) is neutral.<br>
According to the present invention, the metal ion is typically bonded to the .alpha.-amino group by coordinate covalent bond and weak bond as mentioned above.<br>
In the place of using single Aminoacid, the amino acid chelates can also be prepared using small peptide amino acids wherein the peptide may be in the form of dipeptides, tripeptides, and sometimes tetrapeptides.<br>
One advantage of amino acid chelates in the field of mineral nutrition is attributed to the fact that these chelates are readily absorbed in the absorptive mucosal cells or plant cells by means of active transport or other known mechanisms. In other words, the minerals are absorbed along with the amino acids as a single unit utilizing the amino acids as carrier molecules.<br>
Therefore, the problems associated with the competition of ions for active sites and the suppression of specific nutritive mineral elements by others are avoided.<br><br>
This is especially true for compounds such as Ferrous / Ferric sulphates that must be delivered in relatively large quantities in order for the Fauna &amp; Flora to absorb an appropriate amount. This is significant because large quantities often cause nausea and other gastrointestinal discomforts in animals as well as create an undesirable taste. Additionally, in plants, large amounts of these compounds can act to bum leaves and cause other undesirable results.<br>
Use of enhancers to promote the bioavailability of a desired Mineral like Iron in a system has been well documented.<br>
Ascorbic Acid, a unique acid which does not contain the carboxylic acid group in its ring structure, is a strong enhancer of iron absorption. It may exert its "enhancing" effect by promoting acidic conditions within the stomach so that the dietary iron is efficiently solubilized; by reducing ferric iron to its better absorbed ferrous form; by forming chelates with iron in the stomach; and by maintaining the solubility of iron when the food enters the alkaline environment of the small intestine - which counteracts the inhibitory effect of dietary amino acids such as phytates and tannins.<br>
Iron absorption from a semisynthetic meal increased three-fold after adding 75 mg ascorbic acid and four fold after adding 100 mg ascorbic acid (Cook and Monsen 1977; Monsen 1988; Reddy and Cook 1991). Adding 15 mg ascorbic acid caused a three fold increase in iron absorption from a rice porridge meal (Gillooly et al 1983). Studies with maize meals have shown a six fold increase in iron absorption with 150 g papaya containing 65 mg ascorbic acid (Layrisse et al. 1974), to a ten fold increase with 50 or 100 mg ascorbic acid (Derman et al, 1977).<br>
Ascorbic acid can improve iron absorption even in the presence of inhibitors such as phytates in cereals and soya, tannins in tea and calcium. In India, 54 anemic preschool children were supplemented with 100 mg synthetic ascorbic acid versus a placebo, at each of the two main meals, for two months (seshadrietal. 1985).<br><br>
Usual iron and ascorbic acid intakes were low. Ascorbic acid treatment improved hemoglobin concentrations significantly, from 9.38 to 11.30 g/L on average. There was no change in controls (9.08 versus 9.18 g/L) . Weekly iron status assessment showed the 50 mg ascorbic acid supplement to be most effective, and an improvement in iron status could be detected in six weeks.<br>
Organic acids such as citric acid, malic acid, tartaric acid and lactic acid also enhances iron absorption (Derman et al. 1980; Gillooly et al. 1983; Ballot et al. 1987). The geometric mean iron absorption form a rice meal increased significantly with the addition of 1 g citric acid (by 3 fold) 1g L-malic acid (by 2 fold) and 1 g tartaric acid (by 2.3 fold) (Gillooly et al. 1983).<br>
By simple corollary it can be inferred that linking the nutritionally relevant part of the acid radical with the metal amino acid, we find that the enhancer is linked and becomes a part of the amino acid chelate.This orientation is considered ideal as the enhancer is positioned nearest to the mineral to do it's job best.<br>
To elaborate, consider Iron absorption in a Human system. Clinical Trials clearly elaborate the importance of Ascorbic acid (vitamin c) in enhancing the bio absorption of Iron. For this to happen, it is simply and naturally assumed that Ascorbic acid be present in the digestive system<br>
a)	at a dosage<br>
b)	in an ionic effective state<br>
c)	at a position<br>
d)	in a manner and most importantly<br>
e)	at a time when iron is ingested<br>
This in normal practice which rarely happens.<br>
Mixing of iron with ascorbic acid is also not a solution as the stability of Ascorbic acid deteriorates in the presence of a Mineral, in this case Iron.<br><br>
This problem can be overcome by use of Mineral amino acid chelate having a nutritionally relevant anion radical in this case Ferrous Glycine Ascorbate or Ferrous bis glycine di Ascorbate.<br>
US Patent Nos.4067994, 4599152, 4830716, 5516925, 6166071, 6426424, 6458981, 6518240 6541051 relates to method of manufacture of an amino acid chelates.<br>
However, they restrict themselves to the relevance, use and method of manufacture of mineral amino acid chelates in general and not on the anions attached. Mention of a few of the anion radicals, if any, in the prior art is only by outlining it's role as a non interfering anion. There is no mention of the anion being linked &amp; forming a part of the chelate molecule in a stoichiometric proportion in any patents.<br>
Our invention relates to the charge on the metal totally neutralised by the carboxylic acid group of the alpha amino acid forming a chelate and the resulting chelate is optionally converted to a quarternary ammonium complex either partly or fully using the 'N' of the alpha amino acid group with nutritionally relevant anion radical. Here it is to be understood that either all the alpha amino nitrogens are converted into quarternary ammonium ion(s) or preferably some of the alpha amino nitrogens are converted into quarternary ammonium ion(s) depending on the need. These complexes have a better solubility, bioavailability, stability and palatability in comparison with the compounds / complexes / chelates wherein the quarternary ammonium ion is absent.<br>
The peaks of Infra red spectrum observed at 2100cm"1 of the alpha amino acid and the finger print area of the nutritionally relevant anion radical are absent in the products as claimed in claim 1 and claim 2 emphasing the complete reaction &amp; formation of quarternary ammonium complex.<br>
Proof for presence of a weak bond between quarternary ammonium ion $nd<br><br>
metal ion can be identified by observing in detail the finger prints areas / peaks formed in the metal alpha amino acid chelate having nutritionally relevant anion radical(s) as compared to the chelate wherein the quarternary ammonium ion is absent.<br>
The position of a peak due to formation of quarternary ammonium ion(s) vary depending upon the metal ion linked to the alpha amino acid.<br>
For example, but not as a limitation, the IR spectrum goes to prove the<br>
structures as claimed in claim 1 and claim 2.<br>
Comparison of the IR graphs of<br>
a) Glycine	b) Iron bis Glycinate<br>
c) Iron bis Glycine ascorbate      d) Iron bis Glycine Diascorbate<br>
scanned from 400 to 4000cm"1 clearly reveals that Iron bis Glycine ascorbate<br>
and Iron bis Glycine Diascorbate are unique complexes formed as per our<br>
Invention claims and not a simple mixture of Iron bis Glycinate, Ascorbic acid,<br>
Glycine, Iron salt, etc.<br>
Similarly x-ray diffraction of Iron bis Ascorbate and Iron bis diascorbate<br>
revealed the formation of a unique new complex and not the presence of<br>
mixtures of raw material ingredients namely Iron bis Glycinate, Ascorbic Acid,<br>
Glycine, Iron Salt, etc.<br>
This invention, as noted just in the above paragraphs, lays high emphasis on the importance of the method of manufacture and use of nutritionally relevant anion radical linked stoichiometrically to the mineral amino acid chelate.<br>

The bonds may be coordinate covalent, covalent, and/or ionic at the carboxyl oxygen group. However, at the .alpha.-amino group, the bond is typically a coordinate covalent bond. Preferred amino acids include all of the naturally occurring amino acids. Additionally, for purposes of the present invention, "amino acid chelate" shall further include any charged amino acid chelate that is electrically balanced by a acid counter ion/ions.<br>
The "Metal amino acid salt chelate" includes any chelate where the metal is bonded to the amino acid and carries a positive charge with the negative charge ion being any conventionally known anions excluding Radicals formed from ionic dissociation of nutritionally relevant acids Chloride, Sulphate, Nitrate, Carbonate and bicarbonate radicals are a few examples of the Anion forming the above chelates.<br>
"Metals" include nutritionally relevant metals that are known to be needed by living organisms, particularly plants and mammals, including humans. Metals<br><br>
such as copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), iron (Fe).Calcium (Ca), cobalt (Co), magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn), and/or chromium (Cr), among others, are exemplary of nutritionally relevant metals.<br>
The metal atom can be obtained from either an inorganic or organic source.<br>

"Nutritionally Relevant Acids" includes acids and that are known to be needed by living organisms particularly Humans, Animals (including Aquatic organisms /animals and Farming animals and mammals) and plants. They could be directly necessary for an organism's anabolism/growth or they could be required to catalyze / synthesize other nutritive substances produced in the body of an organism (ex enzymes, Harmones etc) in turn necessary for the organism's anabolism / growth.<br>
Examples of some nutritionally relevant anion radical that forms part of the Metal amino acid chelates having a nutritionally relevant anion radical is presented below.<br>
The nutritionally relevant acid used in the manufacture of Metal Amino Acid Chelates having a nutritionally relevant anion radical is presented within brackets.<br><br>

These chelates are prepared by reacting a metal amino acid salt chelate and a nutritionally relevant acid at a ratio sufficient to allow substantially all of the ions present in solution to react forming a positively charged metal amino acid chelate having the desired acid radical as the counter ion. Further, the metal amino acid chelates of the present invention will have a amino acid to<br><br>
metal   to   acid   radical   molar   ratio   from       about   1:1:1    to   4:1:2.<br>
While not wanting to be bound by any theory, a possible mechanism of the process may be as below.<br>
The present invention also reveals a process of manufacturing the alpha amino acid chelates having nutritionally relevant anion radicals) as described above.<br>
In order to manufacture a metal amino acid chelate having nutritionally relevant acid radical, it generally requires that the desired metal aminoacid Hydroxide chelate and desired acid both be dissolved in water/solvent. The acid releases an Hydrogen ion which reacts with the existing anion radical namely Hydroxide group of the metal amino acid chelate forming water. The acid group devoid of the Hydrogen ion links with the metal amino acid and forms a neutral chelate which when ionized has the metal Amino acid with the positive charge and the acid radical and the inorganic Hydroxide radical with the negative charge balancing the charge of the Metal.<br>
The composition can also be manufactured by reacting a metal Amino Acid salt chelate and a salt or ester of the desired acid. Here again the chemistry of reaction is the same with the addition that a salt will also be formed as a byproduct.<br>
Reaction of Metal Amino Acid Hydroxide chelate with a salt or ester of desired acid will also give the desired composition with salt / alcohol as a byproduct.<br>
Direct blending and Drying of the Metal Amino Acid Hydroxide chelate / Metal<br><br>
Amino Acid Salt chelate with desired acid or its salts/esters would also yield the desired product though not in pure scales.<br>
FLOW CHART:<br><br>
Example -1<br>
Preparation of Ferrous Glutamate Hydroxide Ascorbate Chelate. Dissolve one mole of Ferrous sulphate in sufficient water. Add one mole of Glutamic acid and stir the solution under heat to totally dissolve the glutamic acid. Under stirring add one mole of calcium hydroxide. Ferrous hydroxide formed in situ reacts with glutamic acid to form Ferrous Glutamate Hydroxide and stays in solution while calcium sulphate precipitates out and is sepatated by filtration. To the above solution under constant stirring add one mole of Ascorbic acid. A clear solution of Ferrous glutamine hydroxide ascorbate is formed.  The product obtained is dried to constant weight<br><br>
Example 2<br>
Preparation of Ferric Bis Glycine Ascorbate Hydroxide Chelate. Into sufficient water is dissolved two moles of Glycine. Next one mole of Ferric Hydroxide is digested in the above to obtain Ferric Bis Glycine Hydroxide solution. Add one mole of Ascorbic acid to the above solution under constant stirring to obtain Ferric Bis Glycine Hydroxide Ascorbate Solution. The product is dried to constant weight.<br>
Example 3<br>
Preparation of Ferrous Methionine Folate.<br>
Into sufficient water was dissolved one mole of ferrous methionine chloride. Next added one mole of sodium folate under constant stirring. The reaction proceeds with the formation of one mole of Ferrous Methionine folate which precipitate outs leaving the sodium chloride in the solution. This product is washed and dried to constant weight.<br>
Example 4<br>
Preparation of Calcium Glutamate Ascorbate.<br>
Dissolve one mole fo Glutamic Acid in sufficient water. Next add one mole of Calcium Hydroxide. The reaction proceeds with the formation of Calcium Glutamate Hydroxide. One mole of ascorbic acid is added to the above to obtain a clear solution of Calcium Glutamate Ascorbate. The product is dried to constant weight.<br>
Example 5<br>
Preparation of Zinc Bis Glycine Citrate.<br>
Dissolve 2 moles of glycine in sufficient water. To the above add one mole of<br><br>
zinc hydroxide. The reaction proceeds with the formation of zinc bis glycinate, a white precipitate. Next add one mole of citric acid to the above. The precipitate dissolves to form zinc bis glycine citrate. The product is dried to constant weight.<br>
Example 6<br>
Manufacture of Iron Glutamate Phosphate<br>
Into sufficient water was diluted one mole of glutamic acid. To the above one mole of ferrous sulphate was added under the constant stirring to obtain the clear solution. 2 moles of sodium hydroxide were added to result in the formation of ferrous hydroxide which immediately reacts with glutamic acid to form ferrous glutamate. Now one mole of phosphoric acid is added and pH adjusted to neutral conditions. A precipitate is obtained and is identified to be ferrous glycine phosphate. This product is washed and dried to the constant weight.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
