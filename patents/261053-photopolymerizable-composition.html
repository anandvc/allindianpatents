Photopolymerizable composition [DESCRIPTION]<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a composition that is photopolymerizable upon absorption of light, the composition comprising a binder, a polymerizable compound, a sensitizer and a photoinitiator.<br>
The present invention also relates to a photopolymer printing plate precursor comprising in this order the photopolymerizable composition of the present invention; and to a method of making a lithographic printing plate therewith.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Compositions that are photopolymerizable on absorption of light are well known in the art. Such compositions usually comprise a binder, a polymerizable compound, a sensitizer and a photoinitiator and are disclosed in e.g. EP 1 349 006 A. From said document it is also known, that radical chain transfer agents as described in EP 107 792 can be used to achieve a high sensitivity and that such radical chain transfer agents preferably are sulfur compounds like the mono-thiols 2-mercaptobenzothiazole, 2-mercaptobenzoxazole or 2-mercaptobenzimidazole.<br>
As there is an ongoing trend to do the exposure of photopolymerizable compositions with low-power light sources like Laser-LED's, the sensitivity of the known compositions comprising mono-thiols is still unsatisfactory. Moreover the optimization of photopolymerizable compositions and of printing plate precursors often is accompanied by a loss in sensitivity. This is e.g. the case when stabilizing the composition against environmental effects or when limiting the absorption spectra to allow for room light<br><br>
handling. Therefore means are needed to compensate for such a sensitivity loss.<br>
Specific aliphatic polythiols for radiation curable compositions are known from e.g. US 4,120,721, wherein the composition forms a solid cured polythioether on exposure, but does not disclose a sensitizer plus photoinitiator system in combination with specific polythiols. The same holds for US 3,993,549, wherein the composition is based on a particulate urea; FR 2,227,558; US 3,753,720; US 3,676,195; and US 3,661,744.<br>
Aliphatic thiols that have a branched structure in a- and/or Imposition of the mercapto group are disclosed in WO 03/72614 and JP 2003-252918 A2 to be suitable for a high sensitivity of photosensitive compositions, wherein the latter of those references discloses such compounds in combination with organoboron complexes.<br>
The use of organoboron complexes is also taught in EP 1 031 579, wherein such boron complexes are combined with a thiol-group-containing compound, that preferably is selected from 5 specific compounds with one, three or four thiol groups.<br>
The polythiols are usually disclosed in the prior art to take part in the photocuring process and to react in combination with electron rich or electron poor polyenes by the thiol-ene mechanism. Therefore they are commonly used in similar stoichiometric amounts as the polyenes and selected in view of the solid polythioether products that are formed by this reaction. Although the invention underlying e.g. WO 03/72614 is said to achieve a high sensitivity, it is disclosed on p. 30 that as the light source generally superhigh pressure mercury lamp, metal halide lamp, xenon lamp and the like are used and the example compositions only have a sensitivity of no higher than 10 mJ/cm2. This demonstrates the unsatisfactory sensitivity of the compositions of the prior art, as for low power light sources the sensitivity has to be significantly higher than 1 mJ/cm2 and therefore has to be in the Î¼j/cm2 region (a lower numerical value corresponds to a higher sensitivity, see below).<br><br>
Therefore there still is a need to find further thiol compounds and a photopolymerizable composition optimized for such compounds, that results in a very high sensitivity, as a broader range of compounds gives a better chance to optimize the photopolymerizable composition, in particular those comprising a binder, a polymerizable compound, a sensitizer and a photoinitiator.<br>
This optimisation with respect to the properties and the costs as well is particularly important when using the photopolymerizable composition for the preparation of a lithographic printing plate precursor.<br>
In addition the known photopolymerizable compositions are still unsatisfactory in that they are not resistant enough after exposure and processing, in particular that they are not hard enough, which results e.g. when used for a lithographic printing plate precursor in a printing plate made from such a precursor that has a short lifetime when used for printing. This lifetime when used for printing is also called run-length on the press.<br>
In lithographic printing, a so-called printing master such as a printing plate is mounted on a cylinder of the printing press. The master carries a lithographic image on its surface and a printed copy is obtained by applying ink to said image and then transferring the ink from the master onto a receiver material, which is typically paper. In conventional, so-called "wet" lithographic printing, ink as well as an aqueous fountain solution (also called dampening liquid) are supplied to the lithographic image which consists of oleophilic (or hydrophobic, i.e. ink-accepting, water-repelling) areas as well as hydrophilic (or oleophobic, i.e. water-accepting, ink-repelling) areas. In so-called Mriographic" printing, the lithographic image consists of ink-accepting and ink-abhesive (ink-repelling) areas and during driographic printing, only ink is supplied to the master.<br>
Printing masters are generally obtained by the so-called computer-to-film (CtF) method, wherein various pre-press steps such as typeface selection, scanning, color separation, screening,<br><br>
trapping, layout and imposition are accomplished digitally and each color selection is transferred to graphic arts film using an imagesetter. After processing, the film can be used as a mask for the exposure of an imaging material called plate precursor and after plate processing, a printing plate is obtained which can be used as a master. Since about 1995, the so-called Acomputer-to-plate' (CtP) method has gained a lot of interest. This method, also called Mirect-to-plate', bypasses the creation of film because the digital document is transferred directly to a printing plate precursor by means of a so-called plate-setter. A printing plate precursor for CtP is often called a digital plate.<br>
Digital plates can roughly be divided in three categories : (i) silver plates, which work according to the silver salt diffusion transfer mechanism; (ii) photopolymer plates which contain a photopolymerizable composition that hardens upon exposure to light and (iii) thermal plates of which the imaging mechanism is triggered by heat or by light-to-heat conversion. Thermal plates are mainly sensitized for infrared lasers emitting at 830 nm or 1064 nm. Typical photopolymer plates are sensitized for visible light, mainly for exposure by an Ar laser (488 nm) or a FD-YAG laser (532 nm) . The wide-scale availability of low cost blue or violet laser diodes, originally developed for data storage by means of DVD, has enabled the production of plate-setters operating at shorter wavelength. More specifically, semiconductor lasers emitting from 350 to 450 nm have been realized using an InGaN material.<br>
Radicals are involved in the hardening reaction of the photopolymerizable composition of photopolymer plates and said hardening reaction is known to be adversely affected by oxygen. To reduce this problem it is known to provide the photosensitive coating with a protective coating, also called oxygen barrier layer, protective overcoat or overcoat layer.<br>
After imaging (exposing) the photopolymer printing plate precursor, the plate is heated for a short time to high temperatures before the overcoat is washed off and the photolayer is developed.<br><br>
This heating step is hereinafter called pre-heat step. During the pre-heat step typical temperatures, when measured at the back of the plate, from about 90Â°C to 150Â°C are used for a short time, typically between 10 seconds and 1 minute. As the conditions of the pre-heat step vary with different types of processors and even for the same processor, a printing plate should exhibit consistent results irrespective to the pre-heat conditions, in particular to the temperature. The range of pre-heat conditions, wherein a printing plate exhibits consistent results is called the pre-heat latitude of said plate.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a highly sensitive composition that is photopolymerisable on absorption of light and in particular such a composition that is suitable to prepare a photopolymer printing plate precursor.<br>
A further object of the present invention is a composition, that when coated on a support to get a lithographic printing plate precursor is hard enough after imaging and processing, to result in printing plate, that has a long lifetime when used for printing.<br>
A further object of the present invention is a photopolymer printing plate precursor comprising the composition of the present invention. The printing plate precursor of the present invention is a flexographic or lithographic printing plate precursor, the latter being highly preferred. Also a method of making a lithographic printing plate, wherein said printing plate precursor is image-wise exposed and thereafter developed, is an aspect of the present invention. Preferred photopolymer printing plate precursors according to the present invention can be exposed with an energy density, measured on the surface of the plate of 100 -pJ/cm2 or less. Preferred embodiments of the photopolymerizable composition, of the printing plate precursor, and of the method of making a lithographic<br><br>
printing plate according to the present invention are defined in the dependent claims.<br>

wherein <br>

In another preferred embodiment of the present invention the oligomer, polymer or copolymer has a hyperbranched structure and comprises at least 6 thiol groups per molecule. Compounds with hyperbranched structure are e.g derived from multi-functional compounds such as polyglycerols which can have many free hydroxy groups and said hydroxy groups can be functionalised by esterification with e.g. HSCH2CH2CO2H to form the multi-functional thiols of the present invention. An example of a hyperbranched compound can be found in Angew.   Chem.   Int.   Ed.,   1999,   38,   3552.<br>
The polythiols of the present invention can be obtained by known synthetic methods.<br>
Examples of preferred compounds of formulae (I) to (IV) are given in the following.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
In the aforementioned formulae (IV-2) to (IV-7) the value of v preferably is in the range from 20 to 5000 and in particular from 50 to 1000.<br>
Surprisingly it has been found, that there is a positive interaction between the polythiols of the present invention with a composition comprising a binder, a polymerizable compound, a sensitizer and a photoinitiator. Only if said ingredients are present, it is possible to achieve the objects of the present invention, in particular a high sensitivity and a high hardness, and said positive interaction is particularly pronounced, if the polymerizable compound comprises at least one of the following N-containing groups: primary, secondary or tertiary amino, urethane or urea. Although the underlying mechanism is not completely understood, it has to be different to the thiol-ene mechanism known from the prior art discussed above. This is because the polythiols of the present invention are even effective at very low levels and need not be in stoichiometric relation to the polymerizable<br><br>
compounds of the composition. Even at such low levels an exceptionally high sensitivity and hardness of the composition is achieved.<br>
Moreover said positive interaction described above is particular pronounced, if the photoinitiator is a hexaaryl-bisimidazole compound or a metallocene compound, in particular a hexaaryl-bisimidazole compound. Although said photoinitiators are known to increase the sensitivity of known photopolymerizable compositions, the increase in sensitivity is higher in combination with the polythiols of the present invention. Therefore it is preferred for the composition of the present invention that the photoinitiator is a hexaaryl-bisimidazole compound.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the composition when coated on a support has a sensitivity of 150 pj/cm2 or higher, preferably 10 0 pj/cm2 or higher and particularly preferred of 60 pj/cm2 or higher.<br>
The sensitivity of the composition as defined in the context of the present invention is the sensitivity of a printing plate precursor obtained by coating said composition in a dry thickness of 1.5 g/m2 on an electrochemically roughened and anodically oxidized aluminum sheet as described in the Examples in paragraph A and coating on top of the so obtained photosensitive layer an overcoat layer as defined by table 3 of the Examples in a dry thickness of 2.0 g/m2. The sensitivity of said printing plate precursor is then measured by imaging through a 13-step exposure wedge with density increments of 0.15 per step using the imaging conditions described in the examples. The sensitivity is then defined to be the minimum energy density that is necessary for a complete hardening of three wedge steps, wherein the coating is considered as being completely hardened when the density of the material is at least 97% of the density of a plate which has been exposed without a filter. So a higher number (numerical value) of said minimum energy density represents a lower sensitivity.<br><br>
The composition of the present invention can comprises a radical stabilizer that can be selected from known radical stabilizers, to avoid unwanted polymerization. Compounds useful as radical stabilizers for the composition of the present invention are also known as antioxidants or radical scavengers that are used as additives for e.g. polymers. Preferably the radical stabilizer used in the present invention is a compound selected from the group consisting of phenoles, organic phosphites, organic phosphonites, amines, hydroxylamines, lactones, hydrochinones, divalent sulfur compounds like thioethers and thioesters, metal complexants, wherein phenoles comprise mono-, di- and trihydroxyphenyl compounds, and in particular the radical stabilizer used in the present invention is a compound selected from the group consisting of hindered phenoles, 0-alkylated hydrochinones, organic phosphites, organic phosphonites, aromatic amines, hindered amines, dialkyl hydroxylamines, benzofuranones and dialkyl thiodipropionates.<br>
The photosensitive coating according to the present invention can comprise one, two, three or more different radical stabilizers. In the case where it contains more than one radical stabilizer, said compounds can belong to the same or different classes.<br>
The radical stabilizers according to the present invention are preferably incorporated in the photopolymerizable composition in an amount of 0.01 to 5 wt.%, in particular from 0.015 to 3 wt.%, with respect to the total weight of the non-volatile compounds of the photopolymerizable composition.<br>
Although the composition of the present invention can comprise a radical stabilizer as disclosed above, it surprisingly also gives very good results without using such a compound. Therefore it is also a preferred embodiment of the present invention, wherein the photopolymerizable composition contains no radical stabilizer as defined above.<br>
Although the present invention is also useful for compositions that are photopolymerizable upon absorption of red and/or infrared radiation, it is preferred for those compositions that are<br><br>
photopolymerizable upon absorption of light with a wavelenght of 600 nm or less, what comprises the green, blue and ultraviolet spectral range. A sensitizing dye (sensitizer) preferably used in the present invention, when incorporated in the photopolymerizable composition, has an absorption wavelength ranging from 300 to 600 nm, preferably from 350 to 430 nm and particularly preferred from 360 to 420 nm, and makes the photopolymer printing plate sensitive to light within said wavelength ranges.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a sensitizer having a solubility in methyl ethyl ketone of at least 15 g/kg, preferably from 15 to 250 g/kg, measured at 20Â°C is used.<br>
The known sensitizing dyes can be used in the composition of the present invention. Suitable classes include dialkylaminobenzene compounds like (S-Ia) and (S-Ib)<br><br>
wherein each of R1 to R4, which are independent of one another, is an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms (Ci-e alkyl group), and each of R5 to R8 is a hydrogen atom or a<br>
Ci-6 alkyl group, provided that R1 and R2, R3 and R4, R1 and R5, R2 and R6, R3 and R7, or R4 and R8, may be bonded to each other to form a ring;<br><br><br>
wherein each of R9 and R10, which are independent of each other, is a Ci-6 aikyl group, each of R11 and R12, which are independent of each other, is a hydrogen atom or a Ci_6 alkyl group, Y is a sulfur atom, an oxygen atom, dialkylmethylene or -N(R13)-, and R13 is a hydrogen atom or a Ci_6 alkyl group, provided that R9 and R10, R9 and Ru, or R10 and R12, may be bonded to each other to form a ring, as disclosed in EP 1 148 387 Al; compounds according to formula (S-II)<br>
  i).<br>
wherein A represents an optionally substituted aromatic ring or heterocyclclic ring, X represents an oxygen atom, a sulfur atom or -N(R16)-, R14, R15 and R16 each independently represent a hydrogen atom or a monovalent nonmetallic atom group and A and R14, or R15 and R16 can be linked together to form an aliphatic or an aromatic ring, as disclosed in EP 1 280 006 A2; 1,3-dihydro-l-oxo-2H-indene compounds as disclosed in EP 1 035 435 A2; the sensitizing dyes disclosed in EP 1 048 982 Al, EP 985 683 Al, EP 1 070 990 Al and EP 1 091 247 A2; and / or an optical brightening agent.<br>
To achieve a very high sensitivity, an optical brightening agent as a sensitizer is preferred. A typical optical brightener, also known as "fluorescent whitening agent", is a colorless to weakly colored organic compound that is capable of absorbing light having a wavelength in the range from 300 to 450 nm and of emitting the absorbed energy as fluorescent light having a wavelength in the range between 4 00 and 500 nm.

Preferred compounds are materials, which are synthesized by the reaction of hydroxyalkyl-(meth)acrylates with diisocyanates. Such compounds are basically known and for instance described in DE 28 22 190 and DE 20 64 079.<br>
The amount of polymerizable compound comprising photooxidisable groups generally ranges from 5 to 75 % by weight, preferably from 10 to 65 % by weight, relative to the total weight of the non volatile compounds of the photopolymerizable composition.<br>

The following specific example is a prefered polymerizable compound:<br><br><br>
It can be useful to combine the polythiol compounds of the present invention with known sulfur containing compounds such as those described in EP 107 792, in particular with thiols like e. g. 2-mercaptobenzothiazole, 2-mercaptobenzoxazole or 2-mercapto-benzimidazole. The amount of such additional sulfur containing compounds generally ranges from 0.01 to 10 % by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 2 % by weight, relative to the total weight of the non volatile components of the photopolymerizable composition.<br>

Their amount generally ranges from about 1 to 20 % by weight, preferably from 2 to 15 % by weight and particularly preferred from about 2 to 10 % by weight related to the total weight of the non volatile components of the composition. Particularly suitable predispersed phthalocyanine pigments are disclosed in DE 199 15 717 and DE 199 33 139. Preference is given to metal-free phthalocyanine pigments.<br><br>
In order to adjust the photopolymerizable composition according to the present invention to specific needs, thermal inhibitors or stabilizers for preventing thermal polymerization may be added. Furthermore additional hydrogen donors, dyes, colored or colorless pigments, color formers, indicators and plasticisers may be present. These additives are conveniently selected so that they absorb as little as possible in the actinic range of the imagewise applied radiation.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the composition is photopolymerizable upon absorption of light in the wavelength range from 300 to 600 nm, preferably 350 to 430 nm, in particular from 380 to 430 nm and particularly preferred from 390 to 420 nm.<br>
The present invention also relates to a photopolymer printing plate precursor comprising the photopolymerizable composition of the present invention on a support, in particular a photopolymer printing plate precursor comprising in this order the photopolymerizable composition of the present invention and a protective coating on a support.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
protective layer has a dry coating weight of less than 2.0 g/m2.<br>
The photopolymerizable composition according to the present invention is applied to the support by processes which are known per se to the person skilled in the art. In general, the components of the photopolymerizable composition are dissolved or dispersed in an organic solvent or solvent mixture, the solution or dispersion is applied to the intended support by pouring on, spraying on, immersion, roll application or in a similar and the solvents are removed during the subsequent drying.<br>
The known supports can be used for the photopolymer printing plate of the present invention, like e. g. foils, tapes or plates made of metal or plastics and in the case of screen-printing also of Perlon gauze. Preferred metals are aluminium, aluminium alloys, steel and zinc, aluminium and aluminium alloys being particularly<br><br>
preferred. Preferred plastics are polyester and cellulose acetates, polyethyleneterephthalate (PET) being particularly preferred.<br>
In most cases it is preferred, to treat the surface of the support mechanically and/or chemically and/or electrochemically to optimally adjust the adherence between the support and the photosensitive coating and/or to reduce the reflection of the imagewise exposed radiation on the surface of the support (antihalation).<br>
The most preferred support to be used for the present invention is made of aluminium or an aluminium alloy, its surface is electrochemically roughened, thereafter anodized and optionally treated with a hydrophilizing agent like e. g. poly(vinylphosphonic acid).<br>
The protective overcoat according to the present invention preferably comprises at least one type of poly(vinyl alcohol), in particular a poly(vinyl alcohol) wherein the mean degree of saponification is less than 93 mol-%.<br>
The degree of saponification is related to the production of poly(vinyl alcohols). As the monomer of poly(vinyl alcohol), vinyl alcohol, is nonexistent, only indirect methods are available for the production of poly(vinyl alcohol) . The most important manufacturing process for poly(vinyl alcohol) is the polymerization of vinyl esters or ethers, with subsequent saponification or transesterification. The preferred starting material for the poly (vinyl alcohol) of the present invention is a vinyl alcohol esterified by a mono carboxylic acid and in particular vinyl acetate, but derivatives of vinyl acetate, vinyl esters of di carboxylic acids, vinyl ethers and the like can also be used. The degree of saponification as defined for the present invention is the molar degree of hydrolysis irrespective of the process used for the hydrolysis. Pure poly(vinyl alcohol) has e. g. a degree of saponification of 100 mol-%, but commercial products often have a degree of saponification of 98 mol-%. The poly(vinyl alcohols) as used for the present invention contain mainly 1,3-diol units, but<br><br>
may also contain small amounts of lf2-diol units. In the partially saponified poly(vinyl alcohols) the ester or the ether group can be distributed statistically or blockwise. Preferred partially saponified poly(vinyl alcohols) of the present invention have a viscosity of a 4 % aqueous solution at 20CC of 4 to 60 mPa#s, preferably of 4 to 20 mPaÂ«s and in particular of 4 to 10 mPaÂ»s.<br>
Poly(vinyl alcohols) preferred for the present invention are commercially available e. g. under the tradename Mowiol. Those products are characterised by two appended numbers, meaning the viscosity and the degree of saponification. For example, Mowiol 8 -88 or Mowiol 8/88 mean a poly(vinyl alcohol) having as 4 % aqueous solution at 20Â°C a viscosity of ca _8 mPaÂ»s and a degree of saponification of 8_8 mol-%. Although the use of only one type of poly(vinyl alcohol) is sufficient to achieve an advantage, it is preferred to use a mixture of two or more compounds, because this allows a more accurate adjustment and a better optimization of further properties of the printing plate precursor. Preferably poly(vinyl alcohols) differing in viscosity as defined above and/or in saponification degree are combined. Particularly preferred are mixture of poly(vinyl alcohols) that differ in viscosity of their 4 % aqueous solutions at 20Â°C for at least 2 mPa*s or that differ in saponification degree for at least 5 mol-%. Most preferred are mixtures comprising at least 3 types of poly(vinyl alcohols), wherein at least two compounds differ in viscosity as defined above for at least 2 mPaÂ»s and at least two compounds differ in saponification degree for at least 5 mol-%.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention the overall mean saponification degree of all poly(vinyl alcohols) used in the protective layer has to be less than 93 mol-%. In a particular preferred embodimend of the present invention said overall mean saponification degree ranges from 71 mol-% to less than 93 mol-% and in particular from 80 mol-% to 92,9 mol-%.<br>
As long as said mean overall saponification limit of 93 mol-% is not reached, one of the poly(vinyl alcohols) used in a mixture<br><br>
can have a mean saponification degree of more than 93 mol-% and even up to 100 mol-%.<br>
The overall mean saponification degree of the poly(vinyl alcohols) used in the protective overcoat of a printing plate precursor can be determined experimentally via 13C-NMR. To measure the 13C-NMR spectraf approximately 200 mg of the protective overcoat are dissolved in 1.0 ml DMSO and from this solution a 75 MHz 13C-NMR spectrum is taken, whose resonances can easily be interpreted and allow to calculate the degree of saponification. Such values are listed in the Examples, in Table 3, as experimental values. A good correlation is obtained between said experimental values and the values known from the product specification of the poly(vinyl alcohols). The latter values are hereinafter called theoretical values of the mean saponification degree and can easily be calculated, when mixture of poly(vinyl alcohols) are used.<br>
Preferably poly(vinyl alcohol)s are used for the present invention in 50 to 99.9 weight percent (wt.%) relative to the total weight of the non-volatile compounds of the protective overcoat.<br>
Apart from poly(vinyl alcohol)s other water soluble polymers can be added to the layer such as poly(vinyl pyrrolidone), poly(ethylene oxide), gelatin, gum arable, oxygen binding polymers with aliphatic amine groups known from EP 352 630 Bl, methyl vinylether/maleic anhydride copolymers, poly(carboxylic acids), copolymers of ethylene oxide and poly(vinyl alcohol), carbon hydrates, hydroxy ethyl cellulose, acidic cellulose, cellulose, poly(arylic acid)and mixtures of these polymers.<br>
Preferably the poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) is only used in small quantities compared to the poly(vinyl alcohol). In a preferred embodiment of the present invention poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) is used from 0 to 10 parts by weight of the poly(vinyl alcohol) used, from 0 to 3 parts by weight being particularly preferred. Most preferred no poly(vinyl pyrrolidone)compounds are used.<br><br>
In addition to the poly(vinyl alcohol) of the present invention and the optional watersoluble polymers disclosed above, the known ingredients of protective layers can be used.<br>
Examples of known ingredients suitable for the protective layer of the present invention are surface wetting agents, coloring agents, complexants, polyethylenimines and biocides.<br>
The protective layer has to be transparent for actinic light. Preferably it is homogeneous, substantially impermeable to oxygen, waterpermeable, and can be washed off preferably with the conventional developer solutions used to form a printing relief after imagewise exposure of the photosensitive layer. Said photosensitive layer is removed imagewise, whereas the protective layer is removable over the entire area of the element created. The wash-off of the protective layer can be done in a separate step, but can be done during the development step as well.<br>
The dry coating weight of the protective overcoat can be measured by the following procedure. A plate is exposed for 4 hours to daylight. Next the plate is pre-heated between 104Â°C and 127Â°C (temperature measured via a thermostrip (THERMAX commerically available from TMC) at the back of the plate). The plate is cut to a size of 100 mm X 100 mm and weighted on an analytical balance with 0.01 mg accuracy (=Weight A). Next the protective overcoat is washed off with water (25Â°C) for 2 minutes. Than the plate is rinsed with demineralised water and dried in an oven at 100Â°C. After drying the plate is allowed to cool down to room temperature, and the weight is determined using the same analytical balance as described earlier (=Weight B). The dry coating weight in g/m2 of the protective overcoat is calculated using the formula below :<br>
Dry coating weight (g/m2)= 100 X (Weight A - Weight B)<br>
The protective layer can be coated on the photosensitive layer with known techniques and the coating solution preferably contains water or a mixture of water and an organic solvent. To allow a<br><br>
better wetting, the coating solution preferably contains, related to the solid content, up to 10 wt.%, and particular preferred up to 5 wt.% of a surface active agent. Suitable representatives of surface active agents comprise anionic, cationic and nonionic surface active agents like sodium alkylsulfates and -sulfonates having 12 to 18 carbon atoms, an example of which is sodium dodecylsulfate, N-cetyl-and C-cetyl betaine, alkylaminocarboxylate and -dicarboxylate, and polyethylene glycols with a mean molar weight up to 400.<br>
In addition, further functions can be added to the protective layer. For example, it can be possible to improve the safelight suitability without decreasing the sensitivity of the layer by adding a coloring agent, e. g. a water-soluble -dye, that has excellent transmission to the light having a wavelength of 300 to 450 nm and that absorbs the light having a wavelength of 500 nm or more. This principle can easily be varied for different wavelengths to adjust the effective spectral sensitivity distribution of the printing plate precursor as needed*<br>
The present invention also relates to a method of making a lithographic printing plate comprising the steps of providing a photopolymer printing plate of the present invention, exposing said printing plate precursor with a laser, preferably with a laser having an emission wavelength in the range from 300 to 600 nm, in particular from 300 to 450 nm, heating the plate to a temperature, when measured at the back of the plate, of 90Â°C to 150Â°C, for a time between 10 seconds and 1 minute, washing off the protective coating and processing the printing plate precursor in an aqueous alkaline developer<br>
In preferred embodiment of the process of the present invention the exposure is done with a laser having an emission wavelength in the range from 380 to 430 nm, in particular in the range from 390 to 42 0 nm, and the exposure is carried out at an energy density, measured on the surface of the plate, of 100 yj/cm2 or less.<br>
The processing of the printing plate precursor of the present invention is done in the usual manner. After image-wise exposure a<br><br>
pre-heat step is performed to improve the crosslinking of the photosensitive layer. Usually the pre-heat step is then followed by the development step, wherein the complete overcoat layer and the unexposed part of the photosensitive layer are removed. The removal (wash-off) of the overcoat layer and the development of the photosensitive layer can be done in two separate steps in this order, but can also be done in one step simultaneously. Preferably the overcoat layer is washed-off with water before the development step. The wash-off can be done with cold water, but it is preferred to use hot water to accelerate the process. What remains on the support after the development step are the exposed and thereby photopolymerized parts of the photosensitive layer. The developer solution used for the development of the exposed printing plate precursors of the present invention preferably is an aqueous alkaline solution having a pH of at least 11, a pH from 11.5 to 13.5 being particularly preferred. The developer solution can contain a small percentage, preferably less than 5 wt.%, of an organic, water-miscible solvent. To adjust the pH of the solution, an alkali hydroxide is preferably used.<br>
Examples of preferred, additional ingredients of the developer solution comprise alone or in combination alkali phosphates, alkali carbonates, alkali bicarbonates, an organic amine compound, alkali silicates, buffering agents, complexants, defoamers, surface active agents and dyes, but the suitable ingredients are not limited to the preferred examples and further ingredients can be used.<br>
The method of development employed is not particularly limited, and may be conducted by soaking and shaking the plate in a developer, physically removing non-image portions while being dissolved in a developer by means of e. g. a brush, or spraying a developer onto the plate so as to remove non-image portions. The time for development is selected depending upon the above method used so that the non-image portions can adequately by removed, and is optionally selected within a range of 5 seconds to 10 minutes.<br><br>
After the development, the plate my be subjected to a hydrophilic treatment by means of, e. g.r gum arabic optionally applied to the printing plate as the case requires (gumming step).<br><br>
Examples<br>
A. Preparation (coating) of the photosensitive layer<br>
A composition was prepared (pw = parts per weight; wt.% = weight percentage) by mixing the components as specified in table 1. A composition such as this was divided equally into portions of 26.21 g, and to each portion was added an amount of co-initiator according to table 2. The resulting composition was coated on an electrochemicaily roughened and anodically oxidized aluminum sheet, the surface of which has been rendered hydrophilic by treatment with an aqueous solution of polyvinyl phosphonic acid (oxide weight 3<br>
g/m2) and was dried for 1 minute at 120Â°C (circulation oven). The<br>
resulting thickness of the layer was 1.5 g/m2.<br>
For each composition (experiment), two coatings were made.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The so formed protective overcoat had a dry thickness of 2.0 g/m2 .<br>
The imaging was carried out with an experimental violet platesetter device (flat bed system) equipped with a violet laser diode emitting between 392 and 417 nm. The following imaging conditions were used :<br>
Scanning speed : 1000 m/sec<br>
Variable image plane power : 0 to 10.5 mW<br>
Spot diameter : 20 pm<br>
Addressability : 1270 dpi<br>
Fixed laser energy setting of 86 yJ/cm2<br>
After imaging the plate was processed in a Agfa VSP85 processor at a speed of 1.2 m/min. During the processing the plate was first heated (pre-heat step), next the protective overcoat was washed off<br><br>
and the photolayer was processed in a water based alkaline developer (Agfa PD91) at 28 Â°C. After a water rinsing and gumming step the printing plate was ready. A 13-step exposure wedge with density Increments of 0.15 was used to determine sensitivity of the plate.<br>
The results of the exposure tests are shown in table 4 as the &gt;urn of the density of the UGRA step wedges measured by a Gretag lacbeth D19C densitometer (cyan setting). One fully hardened step = ..00. Higher values indicate higher sensitivity of the plate.<br>
In the table is given for every experiment (composition) the nean value measured for two plates that were separately coated, and iherefore a highly reliable value. By this experimental procedure *ere eliminated variations in results due to slight differences in bemperature during exposure, laser power, brush pressure in developing bath and human error in making of stock solutions and coatings. In experiment 2 the value for composition L is the mean value from 6 plates, to have a very reliable reference point.<br><br><br>
The absolute sensitivity for ail examples of the present invention was higher than 100 pJ/cm2. To illustrate, an UGRA sum of 3.8 6 for experiment L corresponds to a sensitivity of 68 yj/cm2. It can be clearly seen that the multi-functional thiol co-initiators give rise to plates with a higher sensitivity than standard mono-functional co-initiators such as mercaptobenzthiazole (TH-1) or mercaptobenzoxazole (TH-2). Comparison of III-l with TH-3 also surprisingly shows that an SH functionality of more than 1 is essential for this type of compounds. Experiments A to I show that varying the concentration of (TH-1) in the photolayer over a wide<br><br>
range does not lead to sensitivity as high as plates containing the multi-functional thiols of the present invention. For each multifunctional thiol of the present invention, an optimum concentration in the photolayer can be found by common optimisation experiments.<br><br><br>
