				<td>This invention relates to a point of sale terminal used for transaction with customers at shop &amp; other such counters <br>
One of several advantages of this invention lies in the convenience of use and operation. Its construction is modular and is therefore readily upgradeable mad capable of being modified whenever required.<br>
Various other features of this invention will be apparent from the following further description given hereunder.<br>
The point of sale terminal, according to this invention, comprises a housing accommodating a monitor provided with a task centric keyboard constituted by a set of numeral bearing keys and another set of blank keys, said monitor being also provided with a data entry keyboard slidably mounted within the housing so as to be slid out of and slid into the housing;/a printer slidably mounted within the housing so as to be slid out of and slid into the housing, the printer body having a paper exit slot with cutter at its output side and a paper holder at its input side having friction reducing rib linings and notches into  which spacers are receivable for  paper<br><br>
alignment; a paper tray disposea an the top of the housing in a compartment provided with a lid; a control unit, the operating controls of which are located on the front panel of the housing; a reliable storage memory and a power back up.<br>
The point of sale terminal proposed herein will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings which illustrate, by way of example, and not by way of limitation, one of the various possible embodiments of this invention,<br>
Pig. 1 illustrating the embodiment in front elevation<br>
Pig. 2 illustrating the embodiment in top plan view<br>
Pig. 3 illustrating the embodiment in side view (from<br>
left)<br>
Pig, 4 illustrating the embodiment in exploded view<br>
Fig. 5 illustrating the printer module<br>
Fig. 6  illustrating another view of the printer module<br>
Fig. 7 illustrating the data entry keyboard<br>
Fig. 8 illustrating perspective view of the embodiment<br>
and<br>
Fig.  9  illustrating another perspective view of  the<br>
embodiment showing the dust filter.<br><br>
The monitor M (inclined at 30 degree to the vertical for better viewing when unit is kept on flat surface) is provided with a task centric keyboard K constituted by a set of numeral bearing keys N and another set of blank key B, said monitor being also provided with a data entry keyboard D. The blank keys are operated to indâ– cate various items of goods on the monitor. The task centric keyboard is used for billing by the user, necessary software being employed for the microprocessor disposed in the control unit.<br>
The data entry keyboard D is slidably mounted within the housing H so as to be slid out and slid into the housing<br>
J<br>
on guide rails Gl and rollers Rl.  When in use the said keyboard is slid out and when not in use it is slid in, thus saving space.   The data entry keyboard is used rarely, for feeding in data such as new items of goods, prices applicable, customer names and so on.<br>
The Thermal printer P is slidably mounted within the housing so as to be slid out and slid into the housing on guide rails G2 and rollers R2, thus saving space. When paper roll to be feed the printer is slid out and after<br><br>
paper feed it is slid into the housing. The printer body has a slot S with cutter C at its output side for the printer paper to emerge. After emerging, the printer paper is manually torn off on the cutter C, to be handed over to the customer. When slid into the housing, the printer is disposed flush with the housing.<br>
The printer body has paper holder Q at its input side for receiving blank paper rolls or sheets for being printed. The paper holder has spaced rib linings E for reducing friction between the paper and the paper path. Spacers T are receivable in notches A for aligning said rolls or sheets of different widths. The spacers are in the form of plastic chips, which are insertable into the notches A.<br>
A paper tray is provided at the top of the housing in a coit^artment V provided with a lid L. The paper tray is used for storing blank paper rolls or sheets for future use in the printer. The lid is hinged to enable it to be opened and closed when necessary-<br><br>
A control unit is accommodated within the housing, the controls F of said unit being located on the front panel J of the housing.<br>
A fan is installed within the housing for enabling fresh air from atmosphere to be drawn into the housing through an inlet I for cooling its interior. The used air exits through eui outlet 0. The inlet I is provided with a dust filterX which is slidably removable from and replaceable in the opening w against the inlet I.<br>
Lifting handles N are provided on either side of the housing for lifting and transporting the .entire assembly from place to place. These handles also serve to prevent the housing from butting against a wall or other surface on installation. The handles also serve to allow air flow into the air inlet.<br>
The embodiment has a power back up unit to switch on whenever there is mains power failure.<br>
The top of the housing has slot at Y for receiving and connecting customer display attachment. When the attachment is not in use the slot is closed by a cover Z.<br><br>
As stated above, a microprocessor operating on software necessary to carry out the billing and other software operations is disposed within the control unit.<br>
The embodiment also comprises a reliable storage Tnemory; an intranet connectivity and a built-in modem.<br>
The terms and expressions in this specification are of description and not of limitation, since such terms and expressions do not exclude any equivalents of the features illustrated and described, but it is understood that various other embodiments of the point of sale terminal proposed herein are possible without departing from the scope amd ambit of this invention.<br><br><br>
