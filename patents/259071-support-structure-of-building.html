				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a support structure of buildings, in<br>
which, while securing axis of each support used in buildings, its outer diameter<br>
can be set at any size.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002] As is generally known, a wooden support of large buildings, such as<br>
houses and ships, is one formed by a so-called one-piece, large-diameter, log<br>
member shaped by bringing down a large tree, or is produced by subjecting<br>
many wood chips of timber into a compression molding into a pillar that is one-<br>
piece having a predetermined outer diameter.<br>
Patent Publication l: Japanese Patent Application Publication 2000-265552<br>
and the like.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
TASK TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] However, of the above-mentioned conventional support structures of<br>
building, for example, one formed of a log member is naturally limited in its<br>
outer diameter. Therefore, in the case of using them for a large building, many<br>
supports are necessary in order to secure strength. As a result, it is likely that<br>
the interior space is limited.<br>
On the other hand, in the above-mentioned one formed by compressing<br>
wood chips, an axis as that of support is not secured. It is thus not possible to<br>
obtain a sufficient strength. Therefore, it is not possible to apply it to a large<br>
building.<br>
The present invention was made in view of technical problems of the<br>
above-mentioned conventional support structures of building. Its object is to<br>
provide a support structure that is capable of freely setting the size of outer<br>
2.<br><br>
diameter, while securing axis of support and thereby obtaining a sufficient<br>
strength.<br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING TASK<br>
[0004] The invention according to claim 1 is characterized in that a central<br>
support section having a rectangular cross-section is arranged at a central<br>
position and that a plurality of winding support sections of a substantially<br>
elongate platelike shape are combined and arranged around the central<br>
support section, while being sequentially spirally wound from a longitudinal<br>
direction, thereby fixing each support section under a laminated condition<br>
between inside and outside and setting an overall outer diameter at any size.<br>
[0005] According to this invention, a support is constructed by arranging and<br>
fixing each winding support section around at least one central support section<br>
in a spiral manner like annual rings of a log. Therefore, the central support<br>
section becomes an axis, and each winding support section also functions as a<br>
core member. Thus, it is possible to have a sufficient compression strength of<br>
the entirety in the axial direction (longitudinal direction). Furthermore, each<br>
winding support section is spirally and organically attached. Therefore, it is<br>
also possible to sufficiently have rigidity in lateral direction. As a result, it is<br>
possible to prevent a deformation caused by drying, and it can be formed by<br>
using timber from forest-thinning.<br>
[0006] It is possible to freely set the overall outer diameter by the amount of<br>
the assembly of each winding support section. Therefore, it can be applied to<br>
any building irrespective of small buildings and large buildings. In particular,<br>
it can also be applied in this invention to a large building that cannot be met<br>
by an ordinary log. Therefore, it is possible to decrease its number to be<br>
applied to building in cooperation with high strength in the above-mentioned<br>
axial direction and the like. Thus, it becomes possible to have a large interior<br>
space, etc.<br>
[0007] The invention according to claim 2 is characterized in that three of the<br>
winding support sections on the same circumference are formed to have widths<br>
that are substantially the same, the other winding support section is formed to<br>
3<br><br>
have a width that is longer by a plate thickness that is then wound around the<br>
periphery, and each winding support section is combined and arranged while it<br>
is sequentially spirally wound.<br>
[0008] According to this invention, it is not that each winding support section<br>
of the same width is simply attached from the outside, but one winding<br>
support section is set at a length that is the same as the thickness of the<br>
winding support section wound next. With this, it is possible to spirally and<br>
continuously connect each winding support section. Therefore, a connecting<br>
strength between each winding support section becomes large. As a result, the<br>
entirety of the support becomes high in rigidity and strength, and it can<br>
sufficiently be applied to a large building.<br>
[0009] The inventions according to claims 3 and 4 are characterized in that a<br>
plurality of support units, each being combined by sequentially spirally<br>
winding a plurality of winding support sections around the central support<br>
section, are combined and fixed with each other to an assembled condition,<br>
thereby constituting one support.<br>
[0010] According to these inventions, one support is formed by combining<br>
together a plurality of support unit bodies. Therefore, it is possible to freely<br>
set the size of the support. Furthermore, it becomes possible to further<br>
improve strength in the axial direction since one support can be formed with a<br>
plurality of central support sections.<br>
[0011] The inventions according to claims 5 to 7 are characterized in that the<br>
central support section and the winding support sections are formed to be able<br>
to freely set their lengths in the axial direction.<br>
[0012] According to these inventions, it is possible that the central support<br>
section and each winding support section are previously set at predetermined<br>
lengths and that, while extending these to conform to a building, these are<br>
freely stretched in the axial direction.<br>
[0013] The inventions according to claims 8 and 9 are characterized in that,<br>
when each winding support section is spirally assembled from the central<br>
support section, the length of each support section in the axial direction is<br>
4<br><br>
sequentially spirally changed as the winding support sections are wound<br>
outside from the central support section, and a plurality of support units, each<br>
comprising the central support section and the winding support sections, are<br>
connected together in the axial direction.<br>
[0014] The invention according to claim 10 is characterized in that, when each<br>
winding-side support unit to be wound around the central support unit is<br>
spirally assembled, the length of each support unit in the axial direction is<br>
sequentially spirally changed as the winding-side support units are wound<br>
outside from the central support unit, and a plurality of support unit groups,<br>
each comprising the central support unit and the winding support units, are<br>
connected together in the axial direction.<br>
[0015] According to the inventions of claims 8-10, for example, the winding<br>
support sections (the winding-side support units) are sequentially assembled<br>
from the central support section (the central side support unit) in a manner to<br>
have spiral steps in the axial direction. Therefore, it is possible to assemble<br>
support sections and support units, which are positioned above and below, into<br>
a fitted condition, thereby increasing each adhesion area. As a result,<br>
adhesion strengths of upper and lower support units and support unit groups<br>
are further improved, and strengths in the axial direction and in the diametral<br>
direction are also improved.<br>
[0016] Furthermore, a single support can finally be formed, for example, only<br>
by previously setting each support section at the same length, then assembling<br>
it spirally, then connecting these support units from the vertical directions,<br>
and then cutting the upper and lower end portions. Therefore, yield of the<br>
material improves.<br>
[0017] The invention according to claim 11 is an invention of a support<br>
assembly method. It is characterized in that it comprises a first step of<br>
arranging a central support section having a rectangular cross-section at an<br>
axial central position; a second step of combining and arranging a plurality of<br>
winding support sections of a substantially elongate platelike shape around<br>
the central support section, while being sequentially spirally wound, and<br>
5<br><br>
adhering inner and outer surfaces of each winding support section, and a third<br>
step of cutting away an end portion of the final winding support section, which<br>
projects from an outer side surface of another winding support section, after<br>
termination of the winding.<br>
[0018] According to this invention, it is only necessary to sequentially spirally<br>
assemble and fix each winding support section relative to the central support<br>
section. Therefore, such assembly operation is easy.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0020] In the following, embodiments of the support structure of building<br>
according to the present invention are described in detail, based on drawings.<br>
[0021] Fig. 1 to Fig. 4 show the first embodiment of the present invention.<br>
This support structure is constituted of a wooden central support section 1<br>
disposed at a central position and a plurality of wooden winding support<br>
sections 2, 3, 4, 5..., which are spirally windingly disposed at a periphery of the<br>
central support section 1.<br>
[0022] The central support section 1 is formed of a pillar having a<br>
substantially square cross-section, and its length in the axial direction is freely<br>
set.<br>
6<br><br>
[0023] The above-mentioned plurality of winding support sections 2, 3, 4, 5...<br>
are each formed of pillars that are substantially rectangular in cross-section,<br>
and their lengths in the axial direction are set to be the same as the length of<br>
the central support section 1. The thickness S of each winding support section<br>
is set to be the same, and the width Wl thereof is set at a size double, triple...<br>
in sequence as they are wound outwardly from the central side.<br>
[0024] In other words, at first, the four winding support sections 2, 3, 4, 5 are<br>
spirally disposed on and bonded to four peripheral surfaces la of the central<br>
support section 1 with adhesive B. Of these, the three winding support<br>
sections 2, 3, 4 are set at a width Wl that is two times the width W of the<br>
central support section. Of the other winding support section 5, an end portion<br>
5a is set to be longer by the thickness S of the winding support sections 6, 7, 8,<br>
9, which are next wound around the periphery.<br>
[0025] Furthermore, of the next three winding support sections 6-8, which are<br>
wound on the peripheral surfaces of winding support sections 2-5, the width<br>
W2 is set at a size three times the central support section 1. Of the other<br>
winding support section 9, an end portion 9a is set to be longer by the<br>
thickness S of the next winding support section.<br>
[0026] As mentioned above, of the winding support sections 2-5, 6-9, ..., which<br>
are sequentially wound outside from the central support section 1, the width<br>
Wn of the three is set to be larger double again and again relative to the width<br>
W of the central support section 1, and the other one is set to be larger by the<br>
thickness S of the winding support section wound on this peripheral side.<br>
[0027] The length of each winding support section 2-9... in the axial direction<br>
is set at a length that is substantially the same as that of the central support<br>
section 1. In other words, it is set at any length.<br>
[0028] As a method for assembling each winding support section 2-9..., each<br>
winding support section 2-4 of the onefold is assembled by aligning two<br>
timbers having the same width as that of the central support section and then<br>
by bonding them together by adhesive from the lateral direction. Furthermore,<br>
each of the other winding support section 5 and the winding support sections<br>
7<br><br>
6-8 of the twofold is assembled by aligning three timbers having the same<br>
width as that of the central support section and then by bonding them together<br>
by adhesive under this condition. Similarly, each winding support section of<br>
the threefold or further is assembled by making timbers having the same<br>
width as that of the central support section 1 double again and again and then<br>
by bonding them together in parallel condition.<br>
[0029] The winding support sections 2-5, 6-9... are spirally wound fivefold at<br>
last around the central support section 1. Each winding support section is<br>
strongly bonded at its inside and outside surfaces by adhesive B.<br>
[0030] As shown in Fig. 2, when each winding support section 2-9...is spirally<br>
assembled from this central support section 1, the length of each support<br>
section 1-9... in the axial direction is sequentially spirally changed as the<br>
winding support sections 2-9... are wound outside from the central support<br>
section 1. A plurality of support unit bodies 15, 15..., each being formed of the<br>
central support section 1 and the winding support sections 2-9..., are connected<br>
into a fitted condition from the vertical directions. Upon this, support sections<br>
1.9 of the upper and lower support unit bodies are bonded with each other by<br>
adhesive B. In Fig. 2, only the winding support sections 2-9 are shown by<br>
omitting the winding support sections that are shown in Fig. 1 and are further<br>
wound around the periphery of the winding support sections 6-9.<br>
[0031] As shown in Fig. 1, of the four winding support sections 11-14 wound at<br>
last in the winding support sections 2...wound to have predetermined sizes, an<br>
end portion 14a of the winding support section 14, which is long by the<br>
thickness of S,.is cut off.<br>
[0032] In case that the support sections 1-9 are assembled spirally to have<br>
steps as mentioned hereinabove and the support unit bodies 15 are connected<br>
together into a fitted condition from vertical directions to make the whole have<br>
a predetermined length at last, the upper end portion projects upward and the<br>
lower end portion is in a concave form by the spiral form of the support<br>
sections 1-9... Therefore, each of these projection portion 10a and concave<br>
portion 10a is cut off.<br>
8<br><br>
[0033] With this, as shown in Fig. 3, a single square pillar (support) having a<br>
desired length and a relatively large cross-section is formed.<br>
[0034] Then, it is possible to form a smooth surface by subjecting the entirety<br>
of the surface 16a of this square pillar 16 to machining. In some cases, it is<br>
also possible to subject the surface 16a to carving and painting after<br>
machining to produce a decorated pillar. It is also possible to form a round<br>
pillar having a circular cross'section by cutting off the corner portions of the<br>
square pillar 16 as shown by a dash double-dotted line of Fig. 1. After<br>
conducting a surface treatment of the square pillar 16, it is used as a pillar of a<br>
predetermined building.<br>
[0035] As mentioned hereinabove, according to a support structure of the<br>
present embodiment, a square pillar 16 is constructed by arranging and fixing<br>
each winding support section 2-14... around at least one central support<br>
section 1 in a spiral manner like annual rings of a log. Therefore, the central<br>
support section 1 becomes an axis, and each winding support section 2-14...<br>
also functions as a core member. Thus, it is possible to have a sufficient<br>
compression strength of the entirety in the axial direction (longitudinal<br>
direction). Furthermore, each winding support section is spirally and<br>
organically attached. Therefore, it is also possible to sufficiently have rigidity<br>
in lateral direction.<br>
[0036] As a result, it is possible to prevent a deformation caused by drying,<br>
and it can be formed by using timber from forest'thinning.<br>
[0037] It is possible to freely set the outer diameter of the entirety of the<br>
square pillar 16 (round pillar) by the amount of the assembly of each winding<br>
support section 2-14.... Therefore, it can be applied to any building<br>
irrespective of small buildings and large buildings. In particular, it can also be<br>
applied to a large building that cannot be met by an ordinary log. Therefore, it<br>
is possible to decrease its number to be applied to building in cooperation with<br>
high strength in the above-mentioned axial direction and the like. Thus, it<br>
becomes possible to have a large interior space and the like.<br>
9<br><br>
[0038] It is not that each winding support section 2...14... of the same width is<br>
simply attached from the outside, but one winding support section 5, 9...14 is<br>
set at a length that is the same as the thickness S of the winding support<br>
section wound next. With this, it is possible to spirally and continuously<br>
connect each winding support section 2-14.... Therefore, a connecting strength<br>
between the central support section 1 and each winding support section 2-14...<br>
becomes large.<br>
[0039] As a result, the entirety of the square pillar (support) becomes high in<br>
rigidity and strength, and it can sufficiently be applied to a large building.<br>
[0040] According to this embodiment, it only necessary to sequentially spirally<br>
assemble and fix each winding support section 2 relative to the central support<br>
section 1. Therefore, the assembly operation is easy.<br>
[0041] Furthermore, according to this embodiment, as mentioned above, when<br>
the winding support sections 2- 14 are assembled while winding them from the<br>
central support section 1, the support sections 1-14 are sequentially assembled<br>
in a manner to have spiral steps in the axial direction. Therefore, in case that<br>
the support unit bodies are connected together from the axial direction, it is<br>
possible to assemble each support section 1-14, which are positioned above and<br>
below, into a fitted condition, thereby increasing each adhesion area.<br>
[0042] As a result, adhesion strength of the upper and lower support unit<br>
bodies 15 are further improved, and strengths in the axial direction and in the<br>
diametral direction are also improved.<br>
[0043] Furthermore, a single square pillar 16 can finally be formed only by<br>
previously setting each support section 1-14 to have the same length, then<br>
assembling it spirally, then connecting these support unit bodies 15 from the<br>
vertical directions, and then cutting the upper and lower end portions 10a, 10b.<br>
Therefore, yield of the material improves.<br>
[0044] Furthermore, according to this embodiment, in order to form each<br>
winding support section 2-9... as mentioned above, square timbers having the<br>
same length as that of the central support section 1 are used, and these are<br>
connected in parallel, while sequentially increasing these, to form respective<br>
10<br><br>
ones. Therefore, yield of the material further improves, and it is possible to<br>
lower the cost.<br>
[0045] Fig. 4 shows a second embodiment of the present invention. A central<br>
support section 21 is formed to have an almost square cross-section, which is<br>
the same as that of the first embodiment. However, the thicknesses S1... of<br>
the winding support sections 22... are set to be sequentially larger as it goes to<br>
the peripheral side.<br>
[0046] That is, the width W1 of each winding support section 22-25, which is<br>
wound and arranged on a peripheral surface 21a of the central support section<br>
21, is set at about two times that of the central support section 21, and its<br>
thickness S1 is set to be almost the same as the width S of the central support<br>
section 21. The thickness S2 of each winding support section 26-29 of the<br>
twofold, which is wound and arranged on each peripheral surface of each<br>
winding support section 22-25 of the onefold, is set at 1.5 times that of the<br>
winding support section 22-25. Therefore, an end portion 25a of the last<br>
winding support section 25 of the onefold is set at a length projecting by the<br>
thickness S2 of the twofold.<br>
[0047] The thickness S3 of the winding support sections 30-33 of the threefold<br>
is set at a size that is 1.75 times that of the twofold. Therefore, an end portion<br>
29a of the last winding support section 29 of the twofold is also set at a length<br>
projecting by the thickness S3 of the threefold.<br>
[0048] Furthermore, the thickness S4 of the winding support sections 34-37 of<br>
the fourfold is set at a thickness that is 1.8 times that of the threefold.<br>
Therefore, an end portion 37a of the last winding support section 37 of the<br>
threefold is set at a length projecting by the thickness S4 of the fourfold.<br>
[0049] In such manner, the thickness Sn of the winding support sections 22-37<br>
is set to be sequentially larger as it goes to the peripheral side, and an end<br>
portion of the last winding support section of each fold is formed to project by<br>
the thickness of the peripheral side.<br>
[0050] Similar to the first embodiment, the outer surface 21a of the central<br>
support section 21 and the inner and outer surfaces of each winding support<br>
11<br><br>
section 22... are strongly bonded together by adhesive B, and its length in the<br>
axial length is freely set depending on the size of building or the like.<br>
[0051] Therefore, according to this embodiment, provided that the outer<br>
diameter of a square pillar 38 formed by each support section 21, 22... is the<br>
same, it becomes possible to lower the number of the winding support sections<br>
22... as compared with the case of the first embodiment.<br>
[0052] After forming into the single square pillar 38, similar to the first<br>
embodiment, it is possible to form a decorated pillar by suitably putting<br>
carving and painting after surface treatment or to form a round pillar as<br>
shown by a dash double-dotted line of Fig. 4.<br>
[0053] Fig. 5 shows a third embodiment of the present invention. For example,<br>
the square pillar 16 formed by the first embodiment is used as a single support<br>
unit body 40, and these 9 support unit bodies 40... are combined and bonded to<br>
each other, thereby forming a square pillar 42.<br>
[0054] Also in this embodiment, similar to the first and second embodiments,<br>
as shown in Fig. 6, when each support unit body 40 was outside wound and<br>
assembled from the central support unit body 40, the length of each support<br>
unit body 40 in the axial direction was sequentially spirally changed to have<br>
steps, and a plurality of support unit groups 41 formed of the central support<br>
unit body 40 and the support unit bodies 40 on the winding side were<br>
connected from the axial directions. The length of each support unit body 40...<br>
in the axial direction is set to be almost the same.<br>
[0055] Therefore, according to this embodiment, since a single square pillar 42<br>
is formed by combining a plurality of the support unit bodies 40, it is possible<br>
to freely set the size of the square pillar 42. Furthermore, since it is possible to<br>
form a plurality of the central support sections l...in a single square pillar 42,<br>
it becomes possible to further increase compression strength in the axial<br>
direction.<br>
[0056] Furthermore, as mentioned above, a single square pillar 42 is formed<br>
by spirally winding each support unit body 40... and then by connecting a<br>
plurality of support unit groups 41 from vertical directions. Therefore, similar<br>
12<br><br>
to the first and second embodiments, bonding strength in vertical directions<br>
becomes higher, and yield of the material becomes good.<br>
[0057] The present invention is not limited to each of the above embodiments.<br>
For example, it is also possible to make the number of the winding support<br>
sections less by setting the outer diameter of the central support section to a<br>
relatively large one. Furthermore, it is also possible to freely set the width and<br>
the thickness of each winding support section in accordance with the outer<br>
diameter of the support, etc.<br>
[0058] Furthermore, for example, it is naturally possible to previously process<br>
the winding support sections 2-14 in the first embodiment into ones of sizes<br>
having respective widths without connecting ones of the central support<br>
section 1 in parallel.<br>
[0059] Although wood was used in each embodiment, it is also possible to form<br>
the central support section with wood and the winding support sections with<br>
another material, for example, high-hardness synthetic resin material, etc.<br>
