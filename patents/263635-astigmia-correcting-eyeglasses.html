				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIN<br>
This Invention relates to a pair of astigmia correcting eyeglasses, particularly to one provided with better effectiveness for focusing point and to be used by a person suffering from astigmia.<br>
Astigmia is a kind of eye flaw that eyeballs deflect light incorrectly, and the light deflecting system of the eyeball is composed of a cornea and a crystalline lens. If the outer surface of the light deflecting -system becomes not perfectly circular, parallel rays of light coming from an exterior source do not converge on a single focal point on the retina and become plural images a little superposed on each other, and then this is called astigmia or astigmatism.<br>
A conventional astigmia eyeglasses includes non-transparent lenses provided with many post-shaped through holes, and each post-shaped through hole has a cross-section circular or hexagonal, enabling<br>
parallel light of images seen through the holes converge on a focal point on the retina for correcting the astigmia of a person, achieving the correcting purpose.<br>
However,    although    the    conventional    astigmia    correcting<br>
eyeglasses can obtain the correcting effect, its focusing effect is not so<br>
1A<br>
good as expected, because the viewing line of a user may be hidden by the post-shaped through holes to result in bad focusing function when the user sees an exterior object through the many through holes in the lenses, easily producing blind spots or a dead angle. And the reason is that the post-shaped through holes have the same diameter at two ends, and the lenses are curved to correspond to a facial surface,<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The feature of the invention is a plurality of cone-shaped through holes provided in each lens of a pair of astigmia correcting eyeglasses. The cone-shaped through holes respectively have a larger diameter at an outer side than that at an inner side, and the cone-shaped through holes located nearer the circumference of the lens have a larger inclined angle at a side near the circumference of the lens than the cone-shaped through. holes located in the center portion.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
This invention will be better understood by referring to the accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>
Figure 1 a perspective view of an astigmia correcting eyeglasses<br>
2<br>
in the present invention;<br>
Figure 2 is a top cross-sectional view of the astigmia correcting eyeglasses lens in the present invention:<br>
Figure 3 is a side cross-sectional view of the astigmia correcting eyeglasses lens in the present invention;<br>
Figure 4 is a first partly magnified top cross-sectional view of the astigmia correcting eyeglasses lens in the present invention; '<br>
Figure 5 is a second partly magnified top cross-sectional view of the astigmia correcting eyeglasses lens in the present invention;<br>
Figure 6 is a first partly magnifiediside cross-sectional view of the astigmia correcting eyeglasses lens in the present invention;<br>
Figure 7 is a second partly magnified side cross-sectional view of the astigmia correcting eyeglasses lens in the present invention<br>
Figure 8 is a perspective view of a pair of eyeglasses with the astigmia correcting lenses in the present invention;<br>
Figure 9 is a cross sectional view of a conventional astigmia correcting eyeglasses lens.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF PRIOR ART<br>
Fig. 9 provides a conventional astigmia eyeglasses includes non-transparent lenses provided with many post-shaped through holes, and each post-shaped through hole has a cross-section circular or hexagonal,<br>
3<br>
enabling parallel light of images seen through the holes converge on a focal point on the retina for correcting the astigmia of a person, achieving the correcting purpose.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIEMNT<br>
A preferred embodiment of an astigmia correcting eyeglasses in the present invention, as shown in Figs. 1, 2 and 3, includes a lens frame 11, two non-transparent lenses 12, and two temples 13 as main components combined together.<br>
The lenses 12 are respectively provided with a plurality of cone-shaped through holes 121, which respectively have a large diameter at an outer side than that at an inner side. Further, the cone-shaped through holes 121 located nearer to the circumference of the lens 12 are provided with a larger inclined angle at the side near the circumference of the lens 12 than those 121 located in the center portion.<br>
Therefore, when a user wears the astigmia correcting eyeglasses in the invention, the user sees through the lenses 12 via the cone-shaped through holes 121 an external object, so there occur no dead angles or blind spots for the view of the user because of the intensified augment of focusing function of the cone-shaped through holes 121.<br>
Compared with the conventional astigmia correcting eyeglasses, the astigmia correcting eyeglasses according to the invention have the two lenses provided with the cone-shaped through holes having a larger<br>
4<br>
diameter at the outer side than that at the inner side, and the cone-shaped through holes located nearer to the circumference of the lens have a larger inclined angle at the side near the circumference of the lens than those located in the center portion, so that there may not occur dead angles or blind spots when the person sees through the lenses of the astigmia correcting eyeglasses in the invention owing to the better focusing function, with the viewing lines of the user not obstructed by the through holes because of the cone-shape of the through holes.<br>
While the present invention has been described above, it will be recognized and understood that various modifications may be made therein and the appended claimed are intended to cover all such modifications that may fall within the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
5<br>
WE CLAIM;<br>
1.   An astigmia correcting eyeglasses comprising two non-transparent lenses sustained by a frame, and two temples:<br>
Said non-transparent lenses respectively provided with a plurality of cone-shaped through holes, each said cone-shaped through hole having a large diameter at an outer side than that at an inner side, said cone-shaped through holes located nearer, a circumference of each said lens having a larger inclined angle at a side near said circumference of each said lens than said cone-shaped through holes located in a center portion of each said lens; and,<br>
Said cone-shaped through holes intensifying focusing function of said lenses.<br>
