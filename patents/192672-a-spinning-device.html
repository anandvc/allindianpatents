The invention relates to a spinning device in particular a ring spinning device for winding of a thread or similar onto a tube which is fastened onto a spinning shaft provided with an underwinding barrier which is arranged in a whorl, whereby the whorl is enclosed by a gliding tube with an inner flange and a reception trough and an outer flange, said whorl is furnished at least with one shifting device and whereby between the inner flange of the gliding tube and a ring surface of the whorl a spring is mounted, which has the effect that the underwinding barrier rests in the reception trough above the inner flange when the operating device is out of engagement with the gliding tube.<br>
Such a spinning device is described in DE-Al 42 25 964 which here is referred to explicitly. In practice difficulties developed with regard to the holding of the thread between the underwinding barrier and the reception trough.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to improve the holding of the thread between the underwinding barrier and the reception trough.<br>
For the solution of this task the ground surface of the underwinding barrier and/or in the reception trough is provided with a grooved surface.<br>
Said grooved surface assures that the thread during its reception undulates between underwinding barrier and reception trough and that its holding and its fixation is considerably improved. This applies in particular for thicker yarns whereby a clamping angle of up to 45Â° is possible.<br><br>
The grooved surface can either be tooth-shaped or wave-shaped, whereby the edges of the teeth are preferably rounded and polished to prevent thread damage.<br>
Furthermore, if teeth are provided on both sides these teeth are to be made in such a way tliat they interlock. This considerably extends the conduct length of the thread placed onto the undervvinding barrier.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a spinning device, in particular ring spinning frame, for winding a thread or similar onto a tube, which is fastened on a spinning shaft with underwinding barrier, which is arranged within a whorl, whereby the whorl is enclosed by a gliding tube with an inner flange and a reception trough and an outer flange, said whorl is furnished at least with one shifting device and where between the inner flange of the gliding tube and a ring surface of the whorl a spring is mounted, which has the effect that the underwinding barrier rests in the reception trough above the inner flange if the shifting device is out of engagement with the gliding tube, characterized in that on the ground surface of the underwinding barrier and/or in the reception trough a grooved surface is provided.<br>
Further advantages, characteristics and details of the invention will be disclosed by the following description of preferred embodiments and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which<br><br>
fig. 1   a schematical presentation in partial view of a<br>
longitudinal section through a portion of a spinning unit of a spinning frame<br>
fig.   2	a schematical presentation ot a longitudinal section<br>
according to fig. 1 in a further working position of the object relating to the invention<br>
fig. 3   a detailed view of an underwinding barrier relating to the invention<br>
fig. 4   partial sections of two examples of embodiments of underwinding barriers projected in plan view<br>
According to fig. 1 a spinning shaft 1 of a spinning unit is indicated, onto which a tube 2 is mounted, to serve for winding-on yarn 3. Said yarn windings 3 derive from a thread not further shown, which for instance is drawn from a drafting system and which is guided through a traveller 4. The traveller 4 moves on a spinning ring 5. The spinning ring 5 itself is mounted onto a ring frame 6.<br><br>
The spindle shaft 1 is inserted into a whorl 7, which is provided with a surface 8 to guide a not further shown conveyor belt. By way of said conveyor belt the whorl 7 and together with it also the spindle shaft 1 and the tube 2 are put into revolving movement, whereby the yarn is wound in yarn winding 3 onto the tube 2,<br>
Furthermore, a gliding tube 9 is put over the whorl which can be moved in direction x. This is effected under or against the pressure of a spring 10, which on one side is supported against the ring surface 11 of the whorl 7 and on the other side against the inner flange 12 of the gliding tube 9. Said inner flange 12 together with a ring wall 13 of the gliding tube 9 forms a reception trough 14, into which, after lifting of the gliding tube 9 in the direction x an underwinding barrier 15 can move in, which encloses the spinning shaft 1. Below the inner flange 12 the gliding tube 9 is furthermore enclosed by an outer flange 16.<br>
During the spinning process normally the ring frame is positioned on the level of tube 2 and is moved up and down alongside of the tube 2, whereby the tube 2 rotates together with the spinning shaft 1 and also witn the gliding tube 9. Rotation takes place around a not further shown collar bearing.<br>
During this process the gliding tube 9 is in the operating position as shown in fig. 2, whereby the gliding tube 9 is pressed against the underwinding barrier 15 by means of the spring 10. At this stage the underwinding barrier 15 rests on the reception trough 14 and holds the piecing yarn.<br>
As soon as the tube 2 is filled the so called doffing starts, i.e. the taking off of the full tube 2 and the replacing by a new, empty tube. Before taking off the full tube, spinning out takes place, where upperwinding, backwinding and underwinding takes place. To produce the underwinding the ring rail 6 moves down so far that the thread below the underwinding barrier 15<br><br>
can be put around the spindle shaft 1 in preferably only approximately H   (0,75) windings. At this the ring rail 6 meets the outer flange 16 with at least a protrusion 21 and thus takes the gliding tube 9 along in direction x. Therewith the underwinding barrier 15 leaves the reception trough 14 and the underwinding range 22 are formed as shown in figure 1. Within said underwinding range the above mentioned windings of 3/4 (0,75) of the thread is formed, the ring rail 6 is being lifted, preferably into the piecing position, whereby the thread within the underwinding range of the gliding tube 9 is pressed against the underwinding barrier 15 and thereby is being kept in the reception trough 14 by the underwinding barrier 15.<br>
While the full cops is removed during doffing, the thread being kept within the underwinding is torn, where however, its connection to the traveller 4 remains.<br>
Instead of using the ring rail 21, the gliding tube 9 can also be shifted with the use of a lever 25, which is pivotably movable by a shaft 27 according to arrow 26 in figure 2.<br>
Figures 1 and 2 show that a ground surface 23 of the underwinding barrier is provided with grooves 24. Instead or additionally to these grooves 24, corresponding grooves 28 can also be in the reception trough 14. Both grooved surfaces 24 and 28 either alone or together serve the undulation of the thread during underwinding, i.e. for improvement of holding the keeping/piecing of the thread.<br>
Figure 2 shows that the two grooved surfaces 24 and 28 contact each other, i.e. that they interlock.<br>
In figures 3 and 4 it is indicated that the grooves 24/28 can be of any geometrical design. For instance it can be tooth-shaped, scalloped or wave-shaped. Of course the same also applies for the groove 28.<br><br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>

2.	The spinning device according to claim 1. wherein the grooves (24, 28) are either tooth- or wave- shaped.<br><br>
