The present invention relates to aryloxy substituted phenylamidine derivatives, their process of preparation, their use as fungicide or insecticide active agents, particularly in the form of fungicide or insecticide compositions, and methods for the control of phytopathogenic fungi or damaging insects, notably of plants, using these compounds or compositions.<br>
In international patent application WO-00/46184 certain phenyl-amidine derivatives are disclosed. However, this document does not specifically disclose nor suggest to select such compounds wherein the phenyl ring is substituted according to the invention thus allowing an unexpected and significantly higher fungicide activity.<br>
It is always of high-interest in agriculture to use novel pesticide compounds in order to avoid or to control the development of resistant strains to the active ingredients. It is also of high-interest to use novel compounds being more active than those already known, with the aim of decreasing the amounts of active compound to be used, whilst at the same time maintaining an effectiveness at least equivalent to the already known compounds.<br>
In the same way, it is also always of high-interest to use novel insecticide, nematocide or acaricide agents to control damaging insects or other damaging organisms.<br>

In a further aspect, the present invention also relates to a fungicide or insecticide composition<br>
comprising an effective and non-phytotoxic amount of an active compound of formula (I).<br>
The expression "effective and non-phytotoxic amount" means an amount of composition according<br>
to the invention which is sufficient to control or destroy the fungi present or liable to appear on the<br>
crops, and which does not entail any appreciable symptom of phytotoxicity for the said crops. Such<br>
an amount can vary within a wide range depending on the fungus to be controlled, the type of crop,<br>
the climatic conditions and the compounds included in the fungicide composition according to the<br>
invention.<br>
This amount can be determined by systematic field trials, which are within the capabilities of a<br>
person skilled in the art.<br>
Thus, according to the invention, there is provided a fungicide composition comprising, as an<br>
active ingredient, an effective amount of a compound of formula (I) as herein-defined and an<br>
agriculturally acceptable support, carrier or filler.<br>
According to the invention, the term "support" denotes a natural or synthetic, organic or<br>
inorganic compound with which the active compound of formula (I) is combined or associated to<br><br>
make it easier to apply, notably to the parts of the plant. This support is thus generally inert and should be agriculturally acceptable. The support may be a solid or a liquid. Examples of suitable supports include clays, natural or synthetic silicates, silica, resins, waxes, solid fertilisers, water, alcohols, in particular butanol, organic solvents, mineral and plant oils and derivatives thereof. Mixtures of such supports may also be used.<br>
The composition according to the invention may also comprise additional components. In particular, the composition may further comprise a surfactant. The surfactant can be an emulsifier, a dispersing agent or a wetting agent of ionic or non-ionic type or a mixture of such surfactants.

The presence of at least one surfactant is generally essential when the active compound and/or the inert support are water-insoluble and when the vector agent for the application is water. Preferably, surfactant content may be comprised from 5% to 40% by weight of the composition.<br>
Optionally, additional components may also be included, e.g. protective colloids, adhesives, thickeners, thixotropic agents, penetration agents, stabilisers, sequestering agents. More generally, the active compounds can be combined with any solid or liquid additive, which complies with the usual formulation techniques.<br>

The fungicide or insecticide composition according to the invention may also be used against fungal diseases or damaging insects liable to grow or attack on or inside timber. The term "timber" means all types of species of wood, and all types of working of this wood intended for construction, for example solid wood, high-density wood, laminated wood, and plywood. The method for treating timber according to the invention mainly consists in contacting one or more compounds according to the invention, or a composition according to the invention ; this includes for example direct application, spraying, dipping, injection or any other suitable means.<br>
The dose of active compound usually applied in the method of treatment according to the invention is generally and advantageously from 10 to 800 g/ha, preferably from 50 to 300 g/ha for applications in foliar treatment. The dose of active substance applied is generally and advantageously from 2 to 200 g per 100 kg of seed, preferably from 3 to 150 g per 100 kg of seed in the case of seed treatment.<br><br>
It is clearly understood that the doses indicated herein are given as illustrative examples of the method according to the invention. A person skilled in the art will know how to adapt the application doses, notably according to the nature of the plant or crop to be treated.<br>
The fungicide composition according to the invention may also be used in the treatment of genetically modified organisms with the compounds according to the invention or the agrochemical compositions according to the invention. Genetically modified plants are plants into genome of which a heterologous gene encoding a protein of interest has been stably integrated. The expression "heterologous gene encoding a protein of interest" essentially means genes which give the transformed plant new agronomic properties, or genes for improving the agronomic quality of the modified plant.<br>
The compounds or mixtures according to the invention may also be used for the preparation of composition useful to curatively or preventively treat human or animal fungal diseases such as, for example, mycoses, dermatoses, trichophyton diseases and candidiases or diseases caused by Aspergillus spp., for example Aspergillus fumigatus.<br>
The various aspects of the invention will now be illustrated with reference to the following tables of compounds and examples. The following tables illustrate in a non-limiting manner examples of compounds according to the invention.<br>
In the following examples, M+1 (or M-1) means the molecular ion peak, plus or minus 1 a.m.u. (atomic mass unit) respectively, as observed in mass spectroscopy and M (Apcl+) means the molecular ion peak as it was found via positive atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation in mass spectroscopy.<br>
In the following examples, the logP values were determined in accordance with EEC Directive<br>
79/831 Annex V.A8 by HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) on a reversed-phase<br>
column (C 18), using the method described below :<br>
Temperature: 40°C ; Mobile phases : 0.1% aqueous formic acid and acetonitrile ; linear gradient<br>
from 10% acetonitrile to 90% acetonitrile.<br>
Calibration was carried out using linear alkan-2-ones (comprising 3 to 16 carbon atoms) with<br>
known logP values (determination of the logP values by the retention times using linear<br>
interpolation between two successive alkanones).<br>
The lambda max values were determined in the maxima of the chromatographic signals using<br>
the UV spectra from 190nm to 400nm.<br><br><br><br>
