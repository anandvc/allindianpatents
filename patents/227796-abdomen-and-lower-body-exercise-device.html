Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Now, a first embodiment of the present invention will be explained with<br>
reference to Figs, 1 to 3.<br>
In the above drawings, reference numeral I designates a lower mat, which is<br>
formed at an upper end thereof with upwardly protruding shaft coupling portions<br>
11.<br>
To the lower mat 1 is pivotably coupled an upper mat 2 usable as a backrest.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, the upper mat 2 comprises a reverse U-shaped frame 21,<br>
which is coupled at both ends thereof to the shaft coupling portions 11 by<br>
making use of shafts 12, and an upper panel 22 attached to an upper surface<br>
of the frame 21.<br>
The upper panel 22 is rotatably mounted at an upper surface thereof with a<br>
plurality of pressure rollers 25, which serve to press specific acupuncture points<br>
distributed on the user's back.<br>
Inside the lower mat 1 are installed a plurality of shovers (shock absorbers) 5,<br>
and in turn, these shovers (shock absorbers) 5 are installed with pistons 4,<br>
respectively, in an extendable or retractable manner. The pistons 4 are<br><br>
integrally formed with footstools. 3, protruding upward above an upper surface<br>
of the lower mat 1, in a one to one ratio.<br>
To the shovers (shock absorbers) 5 is constantly applied a gas pressure for<br>
retracting the pistons 4, and at the upper surface of the lower mat 1 are incised<br>
longitudinal movement slots 6 for allowing movement of the footstools 3.<br>
With such a configuration, when the user pushes out the footstools 3 with<br>
his/her feet when sitting on the lower mat 1, the gas pressure applied to the<br>
shovers (shock absorbers) 5 act as a resistance force, resulting in exercise for<br>
the user's lower body, Then, as soon as a force applied to the footstools 3 by<br>
the user is removed, the footstools 3 are returned to their original positions by<br>
the gas pressure, Therefore, the user can constantly exercise his/her lower<br>
body by repeating such a pushing action.<br>
Between the lower mat 1 and the upper mat 2 are interposed plate springs 13,<br>
which serve to constantly provide elasticity to the upper mat 2 for the rising<br>
thereof.<br>
Referring to Fig. 3, each of the plate springs 13 is mounted at an inner side of<br>
the respective shaft coupling portions 11 formed at the lower mat 1, and takes<br>
the form of a coil-so as to give rise to strong rotational elasticity. The plate<br>
spring 13 is centrally fixed to either shaft 12, and is formed at an outermost<br>
portion thereof with a holding recess 14, so that a holding rod 15, protruding<br>
laterally from an inner peripheral surface of the frame 21, is caught therein,<br><br>
thereby allowing the upper mat 2 to be pivoted upward by the rotational<br>
elasticity of the plate spring 1.3.<br>
In this way, since the upper mat 2 tends to be constantly raised by the plate<br>
springs 13, it enables the user to reinforce his/her upper body, in particular, the<br>
abdomen by forcibly pressing the upper mat 2 with a force of the upper body.<br>
In this case, the upper mat 2 can be fixed at a desired inclination.<br>
For this, as shown in Fig, 2, a pair of inclination adjustment plates 16, having a<br>
constant size, is coupled at both sides of the upper end of the lower mat 1.<br>
Each of the inclination adjustment plates 16 has a plurality of inclination<br>
adjustment holes 17 aligned in an arched line. In correspondence to these<br>
holes 17, at either side of the frame 21, is formed a hole 23 so as to selectively<br>
coincide with one of the inclination adjustment holes 17 of the respective<br>
inclination adjustment plates 16 according to a desired inclination of the frame<br>
21.<br>
Therefore, at a position where the frame 21 is raised by a desired inclination,<br>
corresponding inclination adjustment holes 17 of the respective inclination<br>
adjustment plates 16 coincide with the holes 23 of the frame 21, and fixing pins<br>
18 are inserted through the coincided holes 17 and 23, thereby allowing the<br>
upper mat 2 to be fixed at the desired inclination.<br>
As can be clearly understood from the above description, the upper mat 2 may<br>
be pivotably raised relative to the lower mat 1 so as to take the form of a chair,<br>
thereby allowing the user to exercise his/her lower body when sitting on the<br><br>
lower mat 1, or the upper mat 2 and the lower mat 1 may be horizontally<br>
aligned like a bed, thereby enabling exercise of the lower body even in a<br>
convenient lying posture.<br>
With the exercise device of the present invention as stated above, the user can<br>
independently exercise his/her lower body and his/her upper body by using the<br>
footstools 3 and the upper mat 2, and if necessary, can simultaneously exercise<br>
not only the lower body but also upper body.<br>
Moreover, by virtue of its simple structure, the exercise device of the present<br>
invention has low production cost and high productivity, enabling more people<br>
to enjoy the exercise device with a low price,<br>
Preferably, for the convenience of storage, the upper mat 2 and the lower mat I<br>
are stackable one upon another so as to come into close contact with each<br>
other.<br>
Meanwhile, as shown in Fig. 4, in order to allow the abdomen and lower body<br>
exercise device of the present invention to be usable as a substitute for a chair,<br>
the lower mat 1 is provided with a support leg unit 24 at a lower side thereof,<br>
and a pair of handles at both sides thereof.<br>
Reference is now made to Figs. 5 to 10, which illustrate a chair type exercise<br>
device in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In the above drawings, reference numeral 31 designates a body frame defining<br>
the appearance of the exercise device. At an upper plane of the body frame 31<br><br>
is disposed a seat 32, and a backrest 33 is vertically erected from a rear end of<br>
the seat 32.<br>
Alongside a rear end of the body frame 31 under the seat 32 is laterally<br>
installed a rotating shaft 35, so that both ends of the rotating shaft 35 are<br>
coupled to connector portions 34 protruding downward from opposite lateral<br>
edges of the backrest 33, thereby causing the backrest 33 to be<br>
correspondingly pivoted according to rotation of the rotating shaft 35. At both<br>
ends of the rotating shaft 35 are fitted a pair of elastic members 36, which take<br>
the form of coil springs suitable to apply elasticity to the backrest 33 required<br>
for the raising thereof.<br>
In addition, a first fixing lever 37 is fastened to one side of the body frame 31<br>
for allowing selective pivoting of the backrest 33. If the first fixing lever 37 is<br>
tightened, the backrest 33 is fixed in its present state, whereas if the first fixing<br>
lever 37 is released, the backrest 33 is pivotable.<br>
Therefore, in a released state of the first fixing lever 37, the user can effectively<br>
perform abdominal exercise by pushing the backrest 33 downward when sitting<br>
on the seat 32.<br>
That is, since the backrest 33 tends to be constantly raised by the elasticity of<br>
the elastic members 36, in order to lower the backrest 33, the user has to<br>
strongly flex their abdomen sufficiently to overcome the elasticity of the elastic<br>
members 36, resulting in abdominal exercise.<br>
Meanwhile, under the seat 32 is longitudinally installed a guider 38; which is,<br>
fastened at one surface thereof with a second fixing lever 39. In. the guider 38<br><br>
is inserted a footstool support 40 in an extendable or retractable manner, and in<br>
turn, to an end of the footstool support 40 is coupled a footstool rod 41 so as to<br>
extend perpendicular thereto.<br>
Therefore, in a state wherein the footstool support 40 is maximally extended<br>
from the guider 38 as shown in Fig. 9, the user can perform abdominal exercise<br>
by pushing the backrest 33 downward with his/her back while putting his/her<br>
feet on the footstool rod 41. With such a posture, the user can push the<br>
backrest 33 by applying a more strong force while simultaneously applying a<br>
strong force to his/her legs, resulting in effective exercise of his/her lower body<br>
as well as abdominal exercise.<br>
As shown in Figs. 7-10, a plurality of acupressure means 42 includes a plurality<br>
of acupressure members 43 attached to the surface of the backrest 33. The<br>
acupressure members 43 are made of a material selected from among jade,<br>
magnets, wood, metal, or the like; and covers 44 are attached to the backrest<br>
33 to wholly wrap the acupressure members 43, respectively.<br>
Alternatively, as shown in Figs. 11 and 12, each of the acupressure means 42<br>
includes a roller housing 50 and an acupressure roller 51. The roller housing 50<br>
is embedded in the surface of the backrest 33, and the acupressure roller 51 is<br>
rotatably supported in the roller housing 50 by means of a shaft. From an outer<br>
surface of the acupressure roller 51 protrude a plurality of bosses 52 made of<br>
jade or magnets.<br><br>
