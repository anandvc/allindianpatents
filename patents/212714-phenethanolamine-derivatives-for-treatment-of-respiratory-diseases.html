PHENETHANOLAMINE DERIVATIVES FOR TREATMENT OF RESPIRATORY DISEASES<br>
The present invention is concerned with phenethanolamine derivatives, processes for their preparation, compositions containing them and their use in medicine, particularly in the prophylaxis and treatment of respiratory diseases.<br>
Certain phenethanolamine compounds are known in the art as having selective stimulant action at p2-adrenoreceptors and therefore having utility in the treatment of bronchial asthma and related disorders. Thus GB 2 140 800 describes phenethanolamine compounds including 4-hydroxy- '-[[[6-(4-phenylbutoxy)hexyl]amino]methyl]-1,3-benzenedimethanol 1 -hydroxy-2-naphthalenecarboxylate (salmeterol xinafoate) which is now used clinically in the treatment of such medical conditions.<br>
Although salmeterol and the other commercially available p2-adrenoreceptor agonists are effective bronchodilators. the maximum duration of action is 12 hours, hence twice daily dosing is often required. There is therefore a clinical need for compounds having potent and selective stimulant action at  2-adrenoreceptors and having an advantageous profile of action.<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a compound of formula (I)<br><br>

The compounds of formulae (I) and (la) include an asymmetric centre, namely the carbon atom of the<br><br>
group. The present invention includes both (S) and (R) enantiomers either in substantially pure form or admixed in any proportions.<br>
Similarly, where R4 and R5 are different groups or where Re and R7 are different groups, the carbon atom to which they are attached is an asymmetric centre and the present invention includes both (S) and (R) isomers at these centres either in substantially pure form or admixed in any proportions.<br>
Thus the compounds of formulae (I) and (la) include all enantiomers and diastereoisomers as well as mixtures thereof in any proportions.<br>
Salts and solvates of compounds of formulae (I) and (la) which are suitable for use in medicine are those wherein the counterion or associated solvent is pharmaceutically acceptable. However, salts and solvates having non-pharmaceutically acceptable counterions or associated solvents are within the scope of the present invention, for example, for use as intermediates in the preparation of other compounds of formulae (I) and (la) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, and physiologically functional derivatives.<br>
By the term "physiologically functional derivative" is meant a chemical derivative of a compound of formula (I) or (la) having the same physiological function as the free compound offormula (I) or (la), for example, by being convertible in the body thereto. According to the present invention, examples of physiologically functional derivatives include esters.<br>

Furthermore, certain compounds have shown an improved therapeutic index in animal models relative to existing long-acting p2-agonist bronchodilators. In addition, compounds of the invention demonstrate pharmacokinetic properties that will reduce systemic exposure relative to existing long-acting beta2 agonist bronchodilators. As such, compounds of the invention may be suitable for once-daily administration.<br><br>
14<br>
Therefore, compounds of formulae (1) and (la) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, and physiologically functional derivatives have use in the prophylaxis and treatment of clinical conditions for which a selective P2-adrenoreceptor agonist is indicated. Such conditions include diseases associated with reversible airways obstruction such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) (e.g. chronic and wheezy bronchitis, emphysema), respiratory tract infection and upper respiratory tract disease (eg. rhinitis, including seasonal and allergic rhinitis).<br>

In particular, the present invention provides such a method for the prophylaxis or treatment of a disease associated with reversible airways obstruction such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), respiratory tract infection or upper respiratory tract disease. In a further aspect the present invention provides such a method for the prophylaxis or treatment of a clinical condition selected from premature labour, depression, congestive heart failure, skin diseases (e.g. inflammatory, allergic, psoriatic, and proliferative skin diseases), conditions where lowering peptic acidity is desirable (e.g. peptic and gastric ulceration) or muscle wasting disease.<br>

The dose range for adult humans is generally from 0.0005 mg to 100mg per day and preferably 0.01 mg to 1mg per day.<br>
While it is possible for the compound of formula (I) or (la), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, or physiologically functional derivative thereof to be administered alone, it.is preferable to present it as a pharmaceutical formulation.<br><br>
16<br>
Accordingly, the present invention further provides a pharmaceutical formulation comprising a compound of formula (I) or (la) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, or physiologically functional derivative thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient, and optionally one or more other therapeutic ingredients.<br>
The compounds and pharmaceutical formulations according to the invention may be used in combination with or include one or more other therapeutic agents, for example anti-inflammatory agents, anticholinergic agents (particularly an M1t M2, Mi/M2 or M3 receptor antagonist), other p2-adrenoreceptor agonists, antiinfective agents (e.g. antibiotics, antivirals), or antihistamines.

Of particular interest is use of the compound of formula (I) in combination with a phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor or a mixed PDE3/PDE4 inhibitor. The PDE4-specific inhibitor useful in this aspect of the invention may be any compound that is known to inhibit the PDE4 enzyme or which is discovered to act as a PDE4 inhibitor, and which are only PDE4 inhibitors, not compounds which inhibit other members of the PDE family as well as PDE4. Generally it is preferred to use a PDE4 inhibitor which has an IC50 ratio of about 0.1 or greater as regards the IC50 for the PDE4 catalytic form which binds rolipram with a high affinity divided by the IC50 for the form which binds rolipram with a low affinity.  For the purposes of this disclosure, the cAMP catalytic site<br><br>
18<br>
which binds R and S rolipram with a low affinity is denominated the "low affinity" binding site {LPDE 4) and the other form of this catalytic site which binds rolipram with a high affinity is denominated the "high affinity" binding site (HPDE 4). This term "HPDE4" should not be confused with the term "hPDE4" which is used to denote human PDE4. Initial experiments were conducted to establish and validate a [3H]-rolipram binding assay. Details of this work are given in the Binding Assays described in detail below.<br>
The preferred PDE4 inhibitors for use in this invention will be those compounds which have a salutary therapeutic ratio, i.e., compounds which preferentially inhibit cAMP catalytic activity where the enzyme is in the form that binds rolipram with a low affinity, thereby reducing the side effects which apparently are linked to inhibiting the form which binds rolipram with a high affinity. Another way to state this is that the preferred compounds will have an IC50 ratio of about 0.1 or greater as regards the IC50 for the PDE4 catalytic form which binds rolipram with a high affinity divided by the IC50 for the form which binds rolipram with a low affinity.<br>
A further refinement of this standard is that of one wherein the PDE4 inhibitor has an IC50 ratio of about 0.1 or greater; said ratio is the ratio of the IC50 value for competing with the binding of 1nM of [3H]R-rolipram to a form of PDE4 which binds rolipram with a high affinity over the IC50 value for inhibiting the PDE4 catalytic activity of a form which binds rolipram with a low affinity using 1 nM[3H]-cAMP as the substrate.<br>
Examples of useful PDE4 inhibitors are: (R)-(+)-1-(4-bromobenzyl)-4-[(3-cyclopentyioxy)-4-methoxyphenyI]-2-pyrrolidone;<br>
(R)-(+)-1-(4-bromobenzyl)-4-[(3-cyclopentyloxy)-4-methoxyphenyl]-2-pyrrolidone; 3-(cyclopentyloxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-1-(4-N'-[N2-cyano-S-methyl-isothioureido]benzyl)-<br>
2-pyrrolidone;<br>

(R)-(+)-ethyl [4-(3-cycIopentyloxy-4-methoxyphenyl)pyrrolidine-2-ylidene)acetate; and<br>
(S)-(-)-ethyl[4-
 <br>
19<br>
Most preferred are those PDE4 inhibitors which have an IC50 ratio of greater than 0.5, and particularly those compounds having a ratio of greater than 1.0. Preferred compounds are c/s4-cyano-4-(3-cyclopentyloxy-4-methoxyphenyl)cydohexan-1-carboxylic acid, 2-carbomethoxy-4-cyano-4-(3-cyclopropylmethoxy-4-difluoromethoxyphenyl)cyclohexan-1 -one and c/s-[4-cyano-4-(3-cydopropyimethoxy-4-difluoromethoxyphenyl)cyclohexan-1-ol]; these are examples of compounds which bind preferentially to the low affinity binding site and which have an IC50 ratio of 0.1 or greater.<br>

Phosphodiesterase and Rolipram Binding Assays Assay method 1A<br>
Isolated human monocyte PDE4 and hrPDE (human recombinant PDE4) was determined to exist primarily in the low affinity form. Hence, the activity of test compounds against the low affinity form of PDE4 can be assessed using standard assays for PDE4 catalytic activity employing 1 (iM [3H]cAMP as a substrate (Torphy et aj., J. of Biol. Chem., Vol. 267, No. 3 pp1798-1804, 1992).<br>
Rat brain high speed supernatants were used as a source of protein and both enantiomers of [3H]-rolipram were prepared to a specific activity of 25.6 Ci/mmol. Standard assay conditions were modified from the published procedure to be identical to the PDE assay conditions, except for the last of the cAMP: 50mM Tris HCI {pH 7.5), 5 mM MgClj, 50 nM 5"-AMP and 1 nM of [3H]-rolipram (Torphy et al.. J. of Biol. Chem., Vol. 267, No. 3 pp1798-1804, 1992). The assay was run for 1 hour at 30° C. The reaction was terminated and bound ligand was separated from free ligand using a Brandel cell harvester. Competition for the high affinity binding site was assessed under conditions that were identical to those used for measuring low affinity PDE activity, expect that [3H]-cAMP was not present.<br>
Assay method 1B<br>
Measurement of Phosphodiesterase Activity<br>
PDE activity was assayed using a [3H]cAMP SPA or [3H]cGMP SPA enzyme assay as<br>
described by the supplier (Amersham Life Sciences). The reactions were conducted in<br>
96-well plates at room temperature, in 0.1  ml of reaction buffer containing (final<br>
concentrations): 50 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.5, 8.3 mM MgC!2, 1.7 mM EGTA, [^HJcAMP or<br>
[3H] cGMP (approximately 2000 dpm/pmol), enzyme and various concentrations of the<br>
inhibitors. The assay was allowed to proceed for 1 hr and was terminated by adding 50<br>
(AI of SPA yttrium silicate beads in the presence of zinc sulfate. The plates were shaken<br>
and allowed to stand at room temperature for 20 min.   Radiolabeled product formation<br>
was assessed by scintillation spectrometry.<br>
I3HlR-rolipram binding assay<br><br>
21<br>
The [3H]R-rolipram binding assay was performed by modification of the method of Schneider and co-workers, see Nicholson, et al.. Trends Pharmacol. Sci., Vol. 12, pp.19-27 (1991) and McHale et al.. Mol. Pharmacol.. Vol. 39, 109-113 (1991). R-Rolipram binds to the catalytic site of PDE4 see Torphy et_al., Mol. Pharmacol., Vol. 39, pp. 376-384 (1991). Consequently, competition for [3H]R-rolipram binding provides an independent confirmation of the PDE4 inhibitor potencies of unlabeled competitors. The assay was performed at 30°C for 1 hr in 0.5 ^J buffer containing (final concentrations): 50 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCI2, 0.05% bovine serum albumin, 2 nM [3H]R-rolipram (5.7 x 104 dpm/pmol) and various concentrations of non-radiolabeled inhibitors. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2.5 ml of ice-cold reaction buffer (without [3H]-R-rolipram) and rapid vacuum filtration (Brandel Cell Harvester) through Whatman GF/B filters that had been soaked in 0.3% polyethylenimine. The filters were washed with an additional 7.5 ml of cold buffer, dried, and counted via liquid scintillation spectrometry.<br>
Suitable anticholinergic agents are those compounds that act as antagonists at the<br>

Suitable antihistamines (also referred to as H,-receptor antagonists) include any one or more of the numerous antagonists known which inhibit Hi-receptors, and are safe for human use. All are reversible, competitive inhibitors of the interaction of histamine with Hi-receptors. The majority of these inhibitors, mostly first generation antagonists, have a core structure, which can be represented by the following formula:<br><br>
This generalized structure represents three types of antihistamines generally available:<br>
ethanolamines, ethylenediamines, and alkylamines. In addition, other first generation<br>
antihistamines include those which can be characterized as based on piperizine and<br>
phenothiazines. Second generation antagonists, which are non-sedating, have a<br>
similar structure-activity relationship in that they retain the core ethylene group (the<br>
alkylamines) or mimic the tertiary amine group with piperizine or piperidine. Exemplary<br>
antagonists are as follows:<br>
Ethanolamines: carbinoxamine maleate, clemastine fumarate, diphenylhydramine<br>
hydrochloride, and dimenhydrinate.<br>
Ethylenediamines: pyrilamine amleate, tripelennamine HCI, and tripelennamine citrate.<br>
Alkylamines: chlropheniramine and its salts such as the maleate salt, and acrivastine.<br><br>

The combinations referred to above may conveniently be presented for use in the form of a pharmaceutical formulation and thus pharmaceutical formulations comprising a combination as defined above together with a physiologically acceptable diluent or carrier represent a further aspect of the invention.<br>
The individual compounds of such combinations may be administered either sequentially or simultaneously in separate or combined pharmaceutical formulations. Appropriate doses of known therapeutic agents will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art.<br>
Hereinafter, the term "active ingredient" means a compound of formula (I) or (la), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, or physiologically functional derivative thereof.<br>
The formulations include those suitable for oral, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intradermal, intramuscular, intravenous and intraarticular), inhalation (including fine particle dusts or mists which may be generated by means of various types of metered dose pressurised aerosols, nebulisers or insufflators), rectal and topical (including dermal, buccal, sublingual and intraocular) administration, although the most suitable route may depend upon, for example, the condition and disorder of the recipient. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. All methods include the step of bringing the active ingredient into association with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired formulation.<br>
Formulations of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient; as a powder or granules; as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or a non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oii liquid emulsion. The active ingredient may also be presented as a bolus, electuary or paste.<br><br>
25<br>
A tablet may be made by compression or moulding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, lubricating, surface active or dispersing agent. Moulded tablets may be made by moulding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and may be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein.<br>
Formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous ste<br><br>
rile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents. The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilised) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example saline or water-for-injection, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described.<br>
Dry powder compositions for topical delivery to the lung by inhalation may, for example, be presented in capsules and cartridges of for example gelatine, or blisters of for example laminated aluminium foil, for use in an inhaler or insufflator. Formulations generally contain a powder mix for inhalation of the compound of the invention and a suitable powder base (carrier substance) such as lactose or starch. Use of lactose is preferred. Each capsule or cartridge may generally contain between 20ng-10mg of the compound of formula (I) optionally in combination with another therapeutically active ingredient.   Alternatively, the compound of the invention may be presented without excipients.   Packaging of the formulation may be suitable for unit dose or multi-dose delivery. In the case of multi-dose delivery, the formulation can be pre-metered (eg as in Diskus, see GB 2242134 or Diskhaler, see GB 2178965, 2129691 and 2169265) or metered in use (eg as in Turbuhaler. see EP 69715). An example of a unit-dose device is Rotahaler (see GB 2064336). The Diskus inhalation device comprises an elongate<br><br>
26<br>
strip formed from a base sheet having a plurality of recesses spaced along its length and a lid sheet hermetically but peelably sealed thereto to define a plurality of containers, each container having therein an inhalable formulation containing a compound of formula (I) preferably combined with lactose. Preferably, the strip is sufficiently flexible to be wound into a roll. The lid sheet and base sheet will preferably have leading end portions which are not sealed to one another and at least one of the said leading end portions is constructed to be attached to a winding means. Also, preferably the hermetic seal between the base and lid sheets extends over their whole width. The lid sheet may preferably be peeled from the base sheet in a longitudinal direction from a first end of the said base sheet.<br>
Spray compositions for topical delivery to the lung by inhalation may for example be formulated as aqueous solutions or suspensions or as aerosols delivered from pressurised packs, such as a metered dose inhaler, with the use of a suitable liquefied propellant. Aerosol compositions suitable for inhalation can be either a suspension or a solution and generally contain the compound of formula (I) optionally in combination with another therapeutically active ingredient and a suitable propellant such as a fluorocarbon or hydrogen-containing chlorofluorocarbon or mixtures thereof, particularly hydrofluoroalkanes, e.g. dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetra-fluoroethane, especially 1,1,1,2-tetrafIuoroethane, 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoro-n-propane or a mixture thereof. Carbon dioxide or other suitable gas may also be used as propellant. The aerosol composition may be excipient free or may optionally contain additional formulation excipients well known in the art such as surfactants eg oleic acid ¦ or lecithin and cosolvents eg ethanol. Pressurised formulations will generally be retained in a canister (eg an aluminium canister) closed with a valve (eg a metering valve) and fitted into an actuator provided with a mouthpiece.<br>
Medicaments for administration by inhalation desirably have a controlled particle size. The optimum particle size for inhalation into the bronchial system is usually 1-1 O^m, preferably 2-5nm. Particles having a size above 20&gt;m are generally too large when inhaled to reach the small airways. To achieve these particle sizes the particles of the active ingredient as produced may be size reduced by conventional means eg by micronisation. The desired fraction may be separated out by air classification or sieving.<br><br>
27<br>
Preferably, the particles will be crystalline. When an excipient such as lactose is employed, generally, the particle size of the excipient will be much greater than the inhaled medicament within the present invention. When the excipient is lactose it will typically be present as milled lactose, wherein not more than 85% of lactose particles will have a MMD of 60-90nm and not less than 15% will have a MMD of less than 15|am.<br>
Intranasal sprays may be formulated with aqueous or non-aqueous vehicles with the addition of agents such as thickening agents, buffer salts or acid or alkali to adjust the pH, isotonicity adjusting agents or anti-oxidants.<br>
Solutions for inhalation by nebulisation may be formulated with an aqueous vehicle with the addition of agents such as add or alkali, buffer salts, isotonicity adjusting agents or antimicrobials. They may be sterilised by filtration or heating in an autoclave, or presented as a non-sterile product.<br>
Formulations for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with the usual carriers such as cocoa butter or polyethylene grycol.<br>
Formulations for topical administration in the mouth, for example buccally or sublingually, include lozenges comprising the active ingredient in a flavoured basis such as sucrose and acacia or tragacanth, and pastilles comprising the active ingredient in a basis such as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose an acacia.<br>
Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing an effective dose, as hereinbefore recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of the active ingredient.<br>
It should be understood that in addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned above, the formulations of this invention may include other agents conventional in the art having regard to the type of formulation in question, for example those suitable for oral administration may include flavouring agents.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a process for preparing a compound of formula (I) or (la) or a salt, solvate, or physiologically functional<br><br>
28<br>
derivative thereof which comprises a process as described below followed where necessary or desired by one or more of the following steps in any order<br>
(i) optional removal of any protecting groups;<br>
(ii) optional separation of an enantiomer or diastereoisomer from a mixture of<br>
enantiomers or diastereoisomers;<br>
(iii) optional conversion of the product to a corresponding salt, solvate,<br>
or physiologically functional derivative thereof.<br>
(iv) optional conversion of a group R1a, R28 and/or R33 to a group R\ R2 and/or<br>
R3 respectively.<br>
In one general process (A), a compound of formula (I) or (la) may be obtained by deprotection of a protected intermediate, for example of formula (II):<br><br>
or a salt or solvate thereof, wherein R4. R5, R6t R7, m, and n are as defined for the compound of formula (I) or (la), and R1fl, R28, and R30 are each independently either the same as R\ R2, and R3 respectively as defined for the compound of formulae (I) or (la) or a precursor for said group R1, R2, or R3, and R13, R14, and R15 are each independently either hydrogen or a protecting group provided that at least one of R13, R14, and R15 is a protecting group, and R19 is hydrogen or a protecting group.<br>
Suitable protecting groups may be any conventional protecting group such as those described in "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis" by Theodora W Greene and Peter G M Wuts, 3rd edition (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1999). Examples of suitable hydroxyl protecting groups represented by R13 and R14 are esters such as acetate ester, aralkyl groups such as benzyl, diphenylmethyl, ortriphenylmethyl, and tetrahydropyranyl. Examples of suitable amino protecting groups represented by R15 include benzyl, a-<br><br>
29<br>
methylbenzyl, diphenylmethyl, triphenylmethyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, tert-butoxycarbonyl, and acyl groups such as trichloroacetyl or trifluoroacetyl.<br>
As will be appreciated by the person skilled in the art, use of such protecting groups may include orthogonal protection of groups in the compounds of formula (II) to facilitate the selective removal of one group in the presence of another, thus enabling selective functionalisation of a single amino or hydroxy! function. For example, the -CH(OH) group may be orthogonally protected as CHOR19 using, for example, a trialkylsilyl group such as triethylsilyi. A person skilled in the art will also appreciate other orthogonal protection strategies, available by conventional means as described in Theodora W Greene (see above).<br>
The deprotection to yield a compound of formula (I) or (la) may be effected using conventional techniques. It will be apparent to persons skilled in the art that the deprotection method employed should not effect cleavage of the -OCRaR7 moiety.<br>
When R13 and/or R14 is tetrahydropyranyl this may be cleaved by hydrolysis under acidic conditions, for example using aqueous acetic acid. Acyl groups represented by R15 may be removed by hydrolysis, for example with a base such as sodium hydroxide, or a group such as trichloroethoxycarbonyl may be removed by reduction with, for example, zinc and acetic acid. Other deprotection methods may be found in Theodora W Greene {see above). In a particular embodiment of the above process, R13 and R14 may together represent a protecting group as in the compound of formula (III):<br><br>
or a salt or solvate thereof, wherein R4, R5, R6, R7, m, and n are as defined for the compound of formula (I) or (la), and R1e, R20, and R38 are each independently either the same as R\ R2, and R3 respectively as defined for the compound of formulae (I) or (la) or a precursor for said group R1, R2, or R3,<br><br>
30<br>
R18 and R17 are independently selected from hydrogen, C^alkyl. or aryl. In a preferred aspect, both R16 and R17 are methyl.<br>
A suitable precursor group Rla, R23, and/or R33 in the compounds of formulae (II) and (III) would be a group which is convertible to the desired group R1, R2, and/or R3, before, after or simultaneously with the removal of the protecting groups R13, R14, and/or R15. For example, Rta, R28, and/or R33 may suitably be a protected version of a group R\ R2, and R3 respectively, such that removal of the protecting group gives the desired group R1, R2, or R3. Preferred protecting groups in R1a, R23, and/or R33 are those which may be removed under the conditions used for the removal of the protecting groups R13, R14, and/or R15.<br>
The compound of formula (III) may be converted to a compound of formula (I) or (la) by hydrolysis with dilute aqueous acid, for example acetic acid or hydrochloric acid in a suitable solvent or by transketalisation in an alcohol, for example ethanol, in the presence of a catalyst such as an acid (for example, toluenesulphonic acid) or a salt (such as pyridinium tosylate) at normal or elevated temperature.<br>
Compounds of formulae (II) and (III) wherein R15 is hydrogen may be prepared from the corresponding compound of formula (IV);<br><br>
or a salt or solvate thereof, wherein R4, R5, R8, R7, R13, R14 , m, and n are as defined for the compound of formula (II) or (III) and R18, R2*, and R3a are each independently either the same as R\ R2, and R3 respectively as defined for the compound of formula (II) or (III) or a precursor for said group R\ R2, orR3.<br>
A suitable precursor group Rla, R2a, and/or R38 in the compound of formula (IV) would be a group which is convertible to the desired group R\ R2, and/or R3. Suitably, such<br><br>
31<br>
conversions are carried out using conventional methods which are known in the art. For example, where R1 is to be -NR6SO2R9, a suitable precursor group R1a in the compound of formula (IV) would have the amine -NHR8 in place of the substituent R such that the desired substituent R1 may be formed by reaction with the appropriate sulphonyl chloride (i.e. R8SO2CI) before deprotection to form the compound of formula (I).<br>
As a second example, where R1 is to be -NR6C(O)NHR9, a suitable precursor group R1a in the compound of formula (IV) would have the amine -NHR8 in place of the substituent R\ such that the desired substituent R1 may be formed by reaction with the appropriate isocyanate (i.e. R9NCO) before deprotecticn to form the compound of formula (I). Alternatively, where R1 is to be -NHC(O)NHR9, a suitable precursor group R18 in the compound of formula (IV) has -NO2 in place of the substituent R1 which may be reduced to form the corresponding primary amine before reaction with the isocyanate R9NCO as described above to form the desired urea substituent R1. The reduction of the -NO2 group may be effected by any suitable method such as hydrogenation in the presence of a catalyst, for example, palladium/charcoal or platinum oxide, or by reaction with aluminium amalgam in tetrahydrofuran, or with zinc in ammonium chloride solution.<br>
As a further example, where R1 is to be -NR8C(O)R9, a suitable precursor group R10 in the compound of formula (IV) would have the amine -NHR8 in place of the substituent R1, such that the desired substituent R1 may be formed by reaction with the appropriate acyl chloride (i.e. R9C(O)CI) before deprotection to form the compound of formula (I).<br>
As a further example, where R1 is to be -NR8C(O)OR9, a suitable precursor group R1a in the compound of formula (IV) would have the amine -NHR8 in place of the substituent R1, such that the desired substituent R' may be formed by reaction with the appropriate chloroformate (i.e. RfiOC(O)CI) before deprotection to form the compound of formula (I).<br>
Alternatively, where R1 is to be an optionally substituted aryl group, a suitable precursor group R1a in the compound of formula (IV) would have a halo substituent, for example iodo, in place of the substituent R1, such that the desired substituent R1 may be formed by reaction with bis(pinacolato)diboron followed by reaction with the appropriate optionally substituted haloaryl group, before deprotection to form the compound of formula (I). Alternatively, where R1 is to be an optionally substituted aryl group, a suitable precursor group R1ein the compound of formula (IV) would have a halo<br><br>
32<br>
substituent, for example iodo, in place of the substituent R1, such that the desired substituent R1 may be formed by reaction with the appropriate optionally substituted arylboronicacid, for example an optionally substituted phenylboronic acid, before deprotection to form the compound of formula (I).<br>
Alternatively. R1", R2fl, and/or R3" may suitably be a protected version of a group R\ R2, and R3 respectively, such that removal of the protecting group gives the desired group R1, R2, or R3. Preferred protecting groups in R18, R2", and/or R3* are those which may be removed under the conditions used for the removal of the protecting groups R13and R14, or the conditions used for the conversion of the compound of formula (IV) to the compound of formulae (II) or (III). For example, an -NH- group in the desired group R\ R2, or R3 may be protected by a 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxymethyl group or a tert-butoxycarbonyl group.<br>
The conversion of a compound of formula (IV) to a compound of formula (II) or (III) may be effected by treatment with a base, for example a non-aqueous base, such as potassium trimethylsilanolate, or an aqueous base such as aqueous sodium hydroxide, in a suitable solvent such as tetrahydrofuran.<br>
or a salt or solvate thereof, wherein R13 and R14 are as defined for the compound of formula (IV) with a compound of formula (VI):<br><br>
Compounds of formula (IV) may be prepared according to a first method (a) by coupling the corresponding compound of formula (V):<br><br><br>
33<br>
wherein R1a, R2a .R3" ,R\ R5, R6, R7, m, and n are as defined for the compound of formula (IV) and L1 is a leaving group, for example a halo group (typically bromo or iodo) or a sulphonate such as an alkyl sulphonate (typically, methanesulphonate), an arylsulphonate (typically, toluenesulphonate), or a haloalkyl sulphonate (typically, trifluoromethanesulphonate).<br>
The coupling of a compound of formula (V) with a compound of formula (VI) may be effected in the presence of a base, such as a metal hydride, for example sodium hydride, anathonde such as potassium t-butoxide or an inorganic base such as caesium carbonate, in an aprotic solvent, for example dimethylformamide.<br>
Compounds of formula (V) may be prepared by ring closure of a compound of formula (VII):<br><br>

34<br>
chiral catalyst, such as CBS-oxazaborolidine, in a suitable solvent such as tetrahydrofuran.<br>
The compound of formula (VIII) may be prepared from the corresponding halide of formula (IX):<br><br>
wherein R13 and Ruare as defined for the compound of formula (VIII) and Y is a halo group, suitably bromo.<br>
The conversion of a compound of formula (IX) to a compound of formula (VIII) may be effected by reaction with the protected amine HN(COOR18)2 wherein R18 is as defined for the compound of formula (VIII) in the presence of an inorganic base such as caesium carbonate, followed by selective removal of one of the COOR18 groups, for example by treatment with an acid such as trifluoroacetic acid.<br>
Compounds of formula (IX) may be prepared from the corresponding compound having free hydroxymethyl and hydroxy substituents by forming the protected groups Rl3OCH2-and R14O- wherein R13 and R14 are as defined for the compound of formula (IX). Such methods are described in DE 3513885 (Glaxo).<br>

wherein R\ R5, and m are as defined for the compound of formula (VI), and L2 is a leaving group such as halo (typically bromo).<br>
The coupling of compounds (X) and (XI) may be effected in the presence of a base, such as a metal hydride, for example sodium hydride, or an inorganic base such as caesium carbonate, in an aprotic solvent, for example dimethylformamide. Alternatively, the coupling of compounds (X) and (XI) may be effected under phase transfer conditions, suitably in excess aqueous alkali such as 50% aqueous sodium hydroxide, optionally in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst such as a tetrabutylammonium salt, for example tetrabutylammonium bromide.<br>

with the dihydroxy compound of formula HO(CH2)nOH wherein n is as defined for the compound of formula (X). The coupling of a compound of formula (XII) with the<br><br>
36<br>
dihydroxy compound may be effected by methods analogous to those described for the coupling of compounds (X) and (XI).<br>
Compounds of formula (XII) are commercially available or may be prepared by methods well known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
According to an alternative process (b), a compound of formula (IV) as defined above may be prepared by coupling the corresponding compound of formula (XIII):<br><br>

99 BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY<br>
The potencies of the aforementioned compounds were determined using frog melanophores transfected with the human beta 2 adrenoreceptor. The cells were incubated with melatonin to induce pigment aggregation. Pigment dispersal was induced by compounds acting on the human beta 2 adrenoreceptor. The beta 2 agonist activity of test compounds was assessed by their ability to induce a change in light transmittance across a melanophore monolayer (a consequence of pigment dispersal). At the human beta 2 adrenoreceptor, compounds of examples 1 and 4 to 82 had ICa, values below 1 fiM.<br>
Potency at human betai and beta3 adrenoceptors was determined in functional studies using Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with either the human betai adrenoceptor or the human beta3 adrenoceptor. Agonist activity was assessed by measuring changes in intracellular cyclic AMP. For particularly preferred compounds of the invention, selectivity for beta2 adrenoceptors over betai adrenoceptors was typically 10 fold or greater. Selectivity for beta2 adrenoceptors over beta3 adrenoceptors was typically 5 fold or greater.<br>
The onset of action and duration of action in vitro was assessed on isolated superfused airway preparations (human or guinea pig). Tissues were contracted either electrically or by spasmogen. Agonist was perfused over the tissue until maximum relaxation was achieved, and onset of action determined. Perfusion of the agonist was then ceased and duration determined by the time taken for the contractile response to re-establish. For particularly preferred compounds of the invention, onset was typically less than 30min. Duration was typically &gt;3h.<br>
Particularly preferred compounds of the invention are potent and long-acting inhibitors of histamine-induced bronchospasm in conscious guinea pigs. They also demonstrate an improved therapeutic index in conscious guinea pigs (bronchoprotective effects vs blood pressure lowering effects) relative to established long-acting beta2 agonist bronchodilators.<br><br>
100<br>
The particularly preferred compounds of the invention show low oral bioavailability in rat and dog. In human hepatocyte cultures they are metabolised to products that are significantly less potent at the beta2 adrenoceptor than the parent compound.<br>
