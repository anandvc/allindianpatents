				<td>IRON CHELATORS AND USES THEREOF<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to compounds which are capable of<br>
chelating iron and having use in addressing or treating iron-overload<br>
situations.<br>
Background Art<br>
Iron (Fe) is the most abundant metal ion found in cells, reflecting its<br>
crucial roles in the oxidation-reduction reactions upon which life depends.<br>
The rich and unique chemistry of Fe has endowed it with properties<br>
absolutely essential for oxygen transport. ATP production and DNA<br>
synthesis. These characteristics which make Fe an obligate requirement for<br>
life also make it a potential target for preventing the growth of neoplastic<br>
cells.<br>
In order to understand the role of Fe in cellular proliferation and the<br>
possible use of Fe chelators as effective anti-tumour agents, it is important to<br>
describe how this metal ion is transported and metabolised in normal and<br>
neoplastic cells. This is described at length in a review article entitled<br>
"Potential of Iron Chelators as Effective Anti-proliferative Agents" by D.R.<br>
Richardson which is published 1997 in Can J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 75 1164-80<br>
and which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Reference is also made to 'Analogues of Piridoxal Isonicotinoyl<br>
Hydrazone (PIH) as Potential Iron Chelators lor the Treatment of Neoplasia"<br>
by D.R. Richardson reported at Leukaemia and Lymphoma. 1998, 31 47-60<br>
which is also incorporated herein by reference and from which most of the<br>
following discussion has been taken.<br>
Transportation of Fe in the serum is performed by the glycoprotein<br>
transferrin (Tf). which binds two atoms of Fe(III). Transferrin donates its Fe<br>
to cells by binding to specific Tf receptors (TfR) on the cell membrane. Upon<br>
binding to the TfR. the Tf-TfR complex is internalized within endocytotic<br>
vesicles and the Fe released from the protein by a decrease in the<br>
intravascular pH to 5.5. Apart from the specific receptor-mediated process of<br>
Fe uptake from Tf. another process consistent with non-specific adsorptive<br>
pinocytosis has also been reported in rat hepatocytes. human hepatoma cells<br>
and human melanoma cells. Once the Fe is released from Tf. it is then<br>
bound by a specific membrane transporter that remains uncharacterized.<br>
Recently, a possible candidate for this latter protein has been identified,<br>
namely the product of the gene Nramp2. This molecule has been called the<br>
divalent cation transporter 1 (DCT1). and may be involved in both Fe<br>
absorption from the gut and also Fe transport across the endosomal<br>
membrane. Once Fe is transported across the membrane, it then enters a<br>
poorly characterized compartment known as the intracellular Fe pool. The<br>
identity of the pool is highly controversial and may be composed of low Mr<br>
Fe complexes of citrate, amino acids and nucleotides or alternatively, the Fe<br>
may be bound to high Mr macromolecules. Experiments have shown that the<br>
pool is composed of molecules containing Fe in the Fe(II) and Fe(III)<br>
oxidation states. In some cells, such as developing erythroid precursors, the<br>
low \L weight Fe pool represents only a very small fraction of the total<br>
amount of Fe in the cell, whereas in other cell types, such as Chang cells, it<br>
may represent a considerable proportion of the total Fe present. Iron in the<br>
pool can be used for incorporation into Fe-containing proteins, such as the<br>
cytochromes and Fe-S proteins, and when in excess. Fe can be incorporated<br>
into the Fe storage protein ferritin.<br>
The role played by Fe in cellular proliferation has been well<br>
demonstrated in numerous studies. For example, in the absence of Fe,<br>
ribonucleotide reductase cannot produce deoxyribonucleotides and this has a<br>
profound effect on the ceil cycle resulting in a GvS block which can lead to<br>
apoptosis. Cancer cells express very high levels of the transferrin receptor<br>
(TfR). suggesting that they have a high Fe requirement. In fact, in vivo, some<br>
neoplastic cell types take up Fe from Tf at a rate that is comparable to<br>
hemoglobin producing cells such as reticulocytes. It is of interest that the<br>
host may withhold Fe during neoplastic cell proliferation, and this is found<br>
in Hodgkins and non-Hodgkins lymphoma where there is a pronounced<br>
decrease in the saturation of Tf with Fe. This latter phenomenon is known as<br>
the hypoferremic shift, which has been suggested to be a physiological<br>
response to hinder tumor cell growth. The importance of the TfR in Fe<br>
uptake and cell proliferation is demonstrated by the fact that the monoclonal<br>
antibody 42/6 which blocks the binding of Tf to the TfR. also inhibits tumor<br>
growth.<br>
Evidence that neoplastic cells are sensitive to Fe chelation comes from<br>
work in vitro in cell culture experiments and in vivo in clinical trials where<br>
the chelator used to treat Fe overload, desferoxamine (DFODFO) and other<br>
Fe chelators effectively inhibit proliferation. One of the most significant<br>
reports demonstrating a pronounced therapeutic effect of DFO comes from a<br>
study done in patients with neuroblastoma (NB). In this latter trial. DFO<br>
given as an 8 hr intravenous infusion resulted in 7 of 9 patients having more<br>
than a 50% decrease in bone infiltration of tumor cells. Moreover, in 1<br>
patient, a 48% decrease in tumor size was reported. In more recent<br>
investigations. DFO was combined with cytotoxic agents (cyclophosphamide,<br>
etoposide. thio-TEPA and carboplatin) in patients with stage III and IV NB.<br>
From 57 patients studied, there were 24 complete responses. 5 very good<br>
partial responses. 21 partial responses. 3 minor responses and 4 with<br>
progressive disease.<br>
It has now been ascertained that DFO, which is now the drug in<br>
current clinical use. is very expensive, orally ineffective and requires long<br>
subcutaneous infusion (12:24 hr/day. 5-7 days/week) to effect significant Fe<br>
mobilization fOlivieri et al. 1997. Blood 89 739-61: Richardson et al.. 1998.<br>
Am. J. Hematol. 58 299-305). The need for an orally effective and economical<br>
Fe chelator has recently been emphasized by the failure of deferiprone (also<br>
known as L1 or 1.2-dimethyl-3-hydroxypyrid-4-one) to successfully chelate<br>
Fe from Fe-overloaded patients (Olivieri et al.. 1998. New Eng. J. Med. 337<br>
417-23). In fact, treatment of patients with this later drug resulted in hepatic<br>
fibrosis and an increase in liver Fe levels.<br>
One important group of chelators that have shown high Fe chelation<br>
efficacy both in vitro and in vivo are those ligands of the pyridoxal<br>
isonicotinoyl hydrazone (PIH) class referred to in Richardson et al., 1998.<br>
supra. These chelators have a very high affinity and specificity for Fe(III)<br>
that is similar to that found for DFO and much greater than that of<br>
ethylenediaminetetracetic acid (EDTA) as reported in Richardson et al.,<br>
1989. supra and Vitolo et al., 1990, Inorg. Chim. Acta 733 39-50. In addition,<br>
these ligands are synthesized by a simple one-step Schiff base condensation,<br>
are economical and orally effective as discussed in Richardson et al.. 1989. J.<br>
Lab Clin. Med. 131 306-15. Interestingly. PIH can chelate Fe from the<br>
mitochondrion, a site that may become loaded with Fe in the<br>
neurodegenerative disease Friedreich's ataxia (Babcock et al.. 1997. Science<br>
276 1709-12: Foury et al.. 1997. FEES Lett. 411 373-7: Rotig et al.. 1997.<br>
Nature Genetics 12 215-71.<br>
Previous studies have characterized the biological and chemical<br>
properties of analogues of PIH. some of which show higher activity on a<br>
molar basis than the parent compound itself. These compounds were<br>
derived from three groups of aromatic aldehydes, namely, pyridoxal.<br>
salicylaldehyde and 2-hydroxyl-1-naphthylaldehyde. Generally, chelators<br>
derived from pyridoxal were shown to possess high chelation efficacy but<br>
low antiproliferative activity, while ligands derived from 2-hydroxy-1-<br>
naphthylaldehyde had high Fe chelation efficacy and potent antiproliferative<br>
activity. Hence, aroylhydrazones derived from pyridoxal were considered to<br>
be possibly useful as agents to treat Fe overload disease while chelators<br>
derived from 2-hydroxyl-1-naphthylaldehyde were considered to have better<br>
potential for the treatment of cancer. It should be noted that many other Fe<br>
chelators have also demonstrated antiproliferative activity, including DFO.<br>
In fact, some of the most potent effects of DFO have been reported when this<br>
drug was used against the pediatric tumor neuroblastoma. In Cory et al.,<br>
1995. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 35 55-63 and Liu e tal., 1995. Prog. Med. Chem. 32<br>
1-35. there are disclosed a closely related group of chelators derived from 2-<br>
pyridylcarboxaldehyde and thiosemicarbazide (e.g. 3-amincpyridine-2-<br>
carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone) which were found to be among the most<br>
effective inhibitors of ribonucleotide reductase yet identified. However,<br>
these chelators, while having high antiproliferative properties, were found to<br>
have only moderate chelation efficacy and moderate lipophilicity which<br>
made such chelators less efficient in regard to treatment of Fe overload<br>
diseases.<br>
Friedreich's ataxia (FA) is a severe neurodegenerative condition. In<br>
97% of patients the disease is due to a GAA triplet repeat expansion in intron<br>
1 of the FRDA gene resulting in a marked decrease in its expression. The<br>
protein encoded by this gene is known as frataxin and is found within the<br>
mitochondrion. Over the last few years evidence has accumulated to suggest<br>
that frataxin plays a role in mitochondrial Fe metabolism. Studies using the<br>
yeast cell showed that deletion of the homologous gene (YTH1). resulted in<br>
an accumulation of mitochondrial Fe resulting in the loss of mitochondrial<br>
DN'A. [Fe-S] cluster-containing enzymes, and respiration. Like the human<br>
FRDA gene. YFHl encodes a mitochondrial protein (Yfh1p). When YFHl was<br>
reintroduced back into the yeast, mitochondrial Fe was exported back out<br>
into the cytosol. suggesting a "mitochondrial Fe cycle".<br>
Consistent with the knockout yeast model, it was noted that reductions<br>
in mitochondrial DNA. complex I. complex II/III. and aconitase occurred in<br>
the heart of FA patients, observations consistent with mitochondrial damage.<br>
In addition, it was reported increased Fe deposition in the heart, liver, and<br>
spleen was reported in FA patients in a pattern consistent with a<br>
mitochondrial location. This work suggesting the pathology of FA in humans<br>
is caused by mitochondrial Fe overload was strongly supported by work<br>
showing Fe deposits within the heart myofibrils, defective myocardial and<br>
skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration, and perturbations in the heme<br>
biosynthesis pathway.<br>
Since the pathology of FA is linked to mitochondrial Fe overload, new<br>
therapies based on these results could provide hope for FA patients. One<br>
strategy is the use of specific Fe chelators that can permeate the<br>
mitochondrion. Already a trial supported by the National Institute of Health<br>
is investigating the use of the clinically used Fe chelator desferoxamine<br>
(DFO) to treat FA patients. Hou-ever. DFO cannot efficiently mobilize Fe<br>
from cells, and previous studies have demonstrated that it is not effective at<br>
mobilizing Fe from Fe-loaded mitochondria in reticulocytes.<br>
In contrast to DFO. another chelator known as pyridoxal isonicotinoyl<br>
hydrazone (PIH) shows high activity at mobilising Fe from an experimental<br>
model of mitochondrial Fe overload in reticulocytes. A variety of studies, in<br>
vitro, in vivo, and a clinical trial, have demonstrated that PIH and its<br>
analogues show potential for the treatment of Fe-overload disease.<br>
Although a lot of work has been done to develop Fe chelators for use in<br>
medical applications, there is still a need for new chelators which have safe<br>
and efficacious characteristics. The present inventors have now developed<br>
new Fe chelators that have been found as suitable candidates for use in<br>
treating Fe overload disease. The present inventors have synthesized a new<br>
group of ligands known as 2-pyridylcarboxaldehyde isonicotinoyl hydrazone<br>
(PCIH) analogues. Several PCIH analogues are more active than DFO or PIH<br>
at mobilizing Fe from a neuroepithelioma cell line (SK-N-MC). and showed<br>
low antiproliferative activity.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
In a first aspect, the present invention provides 2-<br>
pyridylcarboxaldehyde isonicotinoyl hydrazone (PCIH) analogues suitable for<br>
use as in vivo iron chelators, the PCIH analogue having Formula I:<br>

hydrazone (PCBBH) may be substituted with any other halide group.<br>
In one embodiment, the carrier is an orally administrable carrier.<br>
Preferably, the pharmaceutical composition is in a dosage form formulated as<br>
enterically coated, granules or capsules.<br>
Preferably, the pharmaceutical composition further includes a suitable<br>
buffer to adjust the pH of the stomach of the patient or subject to a level that<br>
will minimize acid hydrolysis. Such a pH should be about 6-3 (more<br>
preferably about 7) for the active compounds per se inclusive of free bases<br>
and hydrochloride salts. More preferably the buffer is a phosphate-citrate<br>
buffer.<br>
The language "administering a therapeutically effective amount" is<br>
intended to include methods of giving or applying an analogue to an<br>
organism which allow the analogue to perform its intended therapeutic<br>
function. The therapeutically effective amounts of the analogue will vary<br>
according to factors such as the type of disease of the individual, the age, sex,<br>
and weight of. and the ability of the analogue to chelate iron in cells of the<br>
individual. Dosage regima can be adjusted to provide the optimum<br>
therapeutic response. For example, several divided doses can be<br>
administered daily or the dose can be proportionally reduced as indicated by<br>
the exigencies of the therapeutic situation.<br>
The analogue can be administered in a convenient manner such as by<br>
injection (subcutaneous, intravenous, etc.). oral administration, inhalation,<br>
transdermal application, or rectal administration. Depending on the route of<br>
administration, the analogue can be coated with a material to protect the<br>
analogue from the action of enzymes, acids and other natural conditions<br>
which may inactivate the analogue chelator.<br>
The analogue can also be administered parenterally or<br>
intraperitoneally. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid<br>
polyethylene glycols, and mixtures thereof and in oils. Under ordinary<br>
conditions of storage and use. these preparations may contain a preservative<br>
to prevent the growth of microorganisms.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for injectable use include sterile<br>
aqueous solutions (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders<br>
for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or<br>
dispersions. In these cases, the composition must be sterile and must be<br>
fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable under the<br>
conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the<br>
contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The<br>
carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water,<br>
ethanol. polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid<br>
polyetheyleue glycol, and the like), suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable<br>
oils. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a<br>
coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in<br>
the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the action<br>
of microorganisms can be achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal<br>
agents, for example, parabens. chlorobutanol. phenol, ascorbic acid.<br>
thimerosal. and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include<br>
isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as mannitol. sorbitol,<br>
sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable<br>
compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent<br>
which delays absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.<br>
Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the<br>
analogue in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a<br>
combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by<br>
filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating<br>
the analogue into a sterile vehicle which contains a basic dispersion medium<br>
and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above.<br>
The analogue can be orally administered, for example, with an inert<br>
diluent or an assimilable edible carrier. The analogue and other ingredients<br>
can also be enclosed in a hard or soft shell gelatin capsule, compressed into<br>
tablets, or incorporated directly into the individual's diet. For oral<br>
therapeutic administration, the analogue can be incorporated with excipients<br>
and used in the form of ingestible tablets, buccal tablets, troches, capsules,<br>
elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and the like. Such compositions and<br>
preparations should contain at least l% by weight of active compound. The<br>
percentage of the compositions and preparations can. of course, be varied<br>
and can conveniently be between about 5 to about 80% of the weight of the<br>
unit. The amount of analogue in such therapeutically useful compositions is<br>
such that a suitable dosage will be obtained.<br>
The tablets, troches, pills, capsules and the like can also contain the<br>
following: a binder such as gum gragacanth. acacia.corn starch or gelatin:<br>
excipients such as dicalcium phosphate: a disintegrating agent such as corn<br>
starch, potato starch, alginic acid and the like; a lubricant such as<br>
magnesium stearate: and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, lactose or<br>
saccharin or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen. or<br>
cherry flavoring. When the dosage unit form is a capsule, it can contain, in<br>
addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier. Various other<br>
materials can be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the physical form<br>
of the dosage unit. For instance, tablets, pills, or capsules can be coated with<br>
shellac, sugar or both. A syrup or elixir can contain the analogue, sucrose as<br>
a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and<br>
flavoring such as cherrv or orange flavor. Of course, anv material used in<br>
preparing any dosage unit form should be pharmaceutically pure and<br>
substantially non-toxic in the amounts employed. In addition, the analogue<br>
can be incorporated into sustained-release preparations and formulations.<br>
The language "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" is intended to<br>
include solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal<br>
agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like. The use of<br>
such media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is well known<br>
in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible<br>
with the analogue, use thereof in the therapeutic compositions and methods<br>
of treatment is contemplated. Supplementary active compounds can also be<br>
incorporated into the compositions according to the present invention. It is<br>
especially advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit<br>
form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form<br>
as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for<br>
the individual to be treated: each unit containing a predetermined quantity of<br>
analogue is calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in<br>
association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for<br>
the novel dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and directly<br>
dependent on (a) the unique characteristics of the analogue and the<br>
particular therapeutic effect to be achieve, and (b) the limitations inherent in<br>
the art of compounding such an analogue for the treatment of iron-related or<br>
iron overload diseases in individuals. The principal analogue is compounded<br>
for convenient and effective administration in effective amounts with a<br>
suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in an acceptable dosage unit. In<br>
the case of compositions containing supplementary active ingredients, the<br>
dosages are determined by reference to the usual dose and manner of<br>
administration of the said ingredients.<br>
Preferably the pharmaceutical composition is administered in a dosage<br>
regimen of 30 - 500 mg per kg of body weight of a patient. More preferably,<br>
the dosage regimen is 50 - 100 mg per kg of body weight.<br>
In a third aspect the present invention provides a method of iron<br>
chelation therapy comprising administering to a patient a pharmaceutical<br>
composition according to the second aspect of the present invention.<br>
In a fourth aspect, the present invention provides a method of treating<br>
an iron-overload disease in a subject, the method comprising administering<br>
to a subject a pharmaceutical composition according to the second aspect of<br>
the present invention.<br>
In one embodiment, the iron-overload disease is ß-thalassemia.<br>
In an alternate embodiment, the disease is Friedreich's ataxia.<br>
In a fifth aspect, the present invention provide use of a 2-<br>
pyridylcarboxaldehyde isonicotinoyl hydrazone (PCIH) analogue according to<br>
the first or second aspects of the present invention in the manufacture of a<br>
medicament for the treatment of an iron-overload disease.<br>
Considering the high potential of the PIH class of ligands which have<br>
high Fe chelation efficiency both in vivo and in vitro, the present inventors<br>
have synthesized a number of aroylhydrazones so as to identify Fe chelators<br>
more efficient than desferoxamine (DFO) and more soluble than those of<br>
the PIH class. These compounds belong to a new series of tridentate<br>
chelators known as the 2-pyridylcarboxyaldehyde isonicotinoyl hydrazone<br>
(PCIH) analogues. The Fe chelation efficacy and antiproliferative activity of<br>
these chelators have been studied including their effects on the expression of<br>
genes (WAF1 and GADD45) known to be important in mediating cell cycle<br>
arrest at GvS. From chelators synthesized, three analogues, namely 2-<br>
pyridylcarboxaldehyde benzoyl hydrazone (PCBH). 2-pyridylcarboxaldehyde<br>
in-bromobenzoyl hydrazone (PCBBH). and 2-pyridylcarboxaldehyde 2-<br>
thiophenecarboxyl hydrazone (PCTH). showed greater Fe chelation activity<br>
than PIH. These ligands were highly effective at both mobilizing 39Fe from<br>
cells and preventing 39Fe uptake from 39Fe-transferrin and caused a marked<br>
increase in the RNA-binding activity of the iron-regulatory proteins (IRPs).<br>
In comparison to the cytotoxic Fe chelator. 2-hydroxy-1-naphthylaldehyde<br>
isonicotinoyl hydrazone (311). these ligands have far less effect on cellular<br>
growth and 3H-thymidine. 3H-leucine or 3H-uridine incorporation. In<br>
addition, in contrast to 311 that markedly increased WAF1 and GADD45<br>
mRNA expression. PCBH and PCTH did not have any effect, while PCBBH<br>
increased the expression of GADD45 mRNA. Collectively, the present results<br>
demonstrate the potential of several of these ligands as agents for the<br>
treatment of Fe overload disease.<br>
Of these particular compounds, it has now been found that PCTH.<br>
PCBH and PCBBH have the potential tor use as agents for treatment of Fe<br>
overload.<br>
The compositions should also, if desired, contain a suitable buffer to<br>
adjust the pH of the stomach of the patient or subject to a level that will<br>
minimize acid hydrolysis. Such a pH should be about 6-8 (more preferably<br>
about 7) for the active compounds per se inclusive of the free bases and<br>
hydrochloride salts discussed hereinafter.<br>
Such buffers are well known to include single or multiple components<br>
such as those listed in the UA Pharmacopoeia XXII. specifically for example,<br>
ammonium, potassium and/or sodium salts of phosphoric acid, in<br>
conjunction with citric acid. Use of a pharmaceutically acceptable antacid,<br>
such as aluminum and/or magnesium hydroxide or calcium carbonate or<br>
glycine USPNF sufficient to neutralize the normally present 0.1 M HCl in the<br>
200-600 ml of stomach fluids (20 to 60 meq of base). A specific example of<br>
phosphate-citrate buffer. pH 6.8. would result from 9.1 ml of 0.1 M citric acid<br>
combined with 40.9ml 0.2M dibasic sodium phosphate solutions.<br>
Measurement of the bioefficiency of chelators of the invention can be<br>
carried out in accordance with the methods described in Brittenham. 2 April<br>
1990. Seminar in Haematolosy 27 112-116 or as described in US 5334492<br>
which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The active compounds of the invention may be made into an enteric<br>
coated granule formulation using the formulations described in US 5834492.<br>
For Example, the drug is combined with sufficient ethanol to make it into a<br>
slightly damp thick paste which is further mixed with providone and<br>
mechanically applied as a layered coating over a spherical support of defined<br>
mesh size. The supports themselves, if desired, are usually<br>
pharmacologically inactive, but an active support may also be utilized. The<br>
spherical matrix could be an acid resistant, biocompatible polymer.<br>
Examples are polycarbonate, polyethylene, teflon, microcrystalline cellulose,<br>
or other plastics. Other biocompatible polymers can also be used.<br>
Enteric polymers and plasticizers are combined in ethanol to form a<br>
solution which is carefully sprayed over the support as a film which covers<br>
the active drug and protects it from premature dissolution in an<br>
environmental pH which is unfavourable for best absorption. The ensuing<br>
product is mechanically dried while preserving the uniformity of the enteric<br>
coating.<br>
Throughout this specification, unless the context requires otherwise,<br>
the word "comprise", or variations such as "comprises" or "comprising", will<br>
be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated element, integer or step, or<br>
group of elements, integers or steps, but not the exclusion of any other<br>
element, integer or step, or group of elements, integers or steps.<br>
Any description of prior art documents herein is not an admission that<br>
the documents form part of the common general knowledge of the relevant<br>
art in Australia.<br>
In order that the present invention may be more clearly understood<br>
preferred forms will be described with reference to the following examples<br>

Modes for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
EXPERIMENTAL<br>
Synthesis of iron chelators and their preparation for screening in culture<br>
PCIH analogues according to the present invention were synthesized<br>
by Schiff base condensation between 2-pyridinecarboxaldehyde and the<br>
respective acid hydrazides. The chelators were characterized by a<br>
combination of elemental analysis, infrared spectroscopy. 1H-NMR<br>
spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. Both PIH and the PIH analogue 2-<br>
hydroxy-1-naphthylaldehyde isonicotinoyl hydrazone (311) were synthesized<br>
and characterized as described previously in Richardson et al.. 1995.<br>
Desferoxamine (desferoxamine mesylate: DFO) was purchased from Ciba-<br>
Geigy Pharmaceutical Co.. Summit. NJ. All of the aroylhydrazone chelators<br>
were dissolved in dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) as 10 mM stock solutions<br>
immediately prior to an experiment and then diluted in 10% fetal calf serum<br>
(FCS: Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. Melbourne. Australia) so that the<br>
final concentration of DMSO was equal to or less than 0.5% (v/v). After<br>
dilution, the solutions were mixed vigorously to ensure total solubilization.<br>
Previous studies by the inventors have demonstrated that DMSO at this<br>
concentration has no effect on either cellular proliferation. 39Fe release from<br>
prelabelled cells, or the ability of the cells to remove 39Fe from Tf<br>
(Richardson et al.. 1995).<br>
Synthesis of free bases<br>
All chelators were prepared by re fluxing 10 mmol of the acid<br>
hydrazide with 2-pyridine carboxaldehyde (or 2-furfural with isonicotinic<br>
acid hydrazide for FIH) m 50% aqueous ethanol (40 mL) for 30 min. After<br>
cooling, the product was collected by filtration, washed with diethyl ether<br>
and dried in a vacuum desiccator. Yields were typically 70-80%.<br>
Syntheses of the hydrochloride salts<br>
A sample (0.25 g) of each free base was dissolved in ethanol (15 mL).<br>
Concentrated hydrochloric acid (1 mL) was added with stirring followed by<br>
diethyl ether (40 mL) to afford precipitation of the hydrochloride salt. The<br>
compound was filtered off and dried in a vacuum desiccator."<br>
Cell Culture<br>
The human SK-N'-MC neuroepithelioma and SK-Mel-28 melanoma cell<br>
lines were from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Rockville.<br>
MD. USA. The SK-N'-MC cell line was originally classified as a<br>
neuroblastoma, but has been recently reclassified as a neuroepithelioma, a<br>
closely related neuroectodermal malignancy. The BE-2 neuroblastoma cell<br>
line was a kind gift from Dr Greg Anderson. Queensland Institute of Medical<br>
Research. Queensland. The SK-N-MC and SK-Mel-28 cell lines were grown<br>
in Eagle's modified minimum essential medium (MEM: Gibco BRL. Sydney.<br>
Australia) containing 10% FCS. 1% (vv) non-essential amino acids (Gibco).<br>
2 mM L-glutamine (Sigma Chemical Co.. St. Louis. MO. USA) 10 µg/ml of<br>
streptomycin (Gibco). 100 U. ml penicillin (Gibco) and 0.28 µg/ml of<br>
fungizone (Squibb Pharmaceuticals. Montreal. Canada). This growth<br>
medium will be subsequently referred to as a complete medium. The BE-2<br>
cell line was grown in Rosewall Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) medium with<br>
all of the supplements described above for MEM. Cells were grown in an<br>
incubator (Forma Scientific. OH. USA) at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of<br>
5% CO/95% air and subcultured as described previously (Richardson et al.,<br>
1990. Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1053 1-12). Cellular growth and viability were<br>
monitored using phase-constant microscopy and trypan blue staining.<br>
Effect of Chelators on Cellular Proliferation<br>
The effects of the chelators on the proliferation of SK-N'-MC<br>
neuroepithelioma cells were examined using the MTT (3-(4.5-<br>
dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2.5-diphenyltetrazolium) assay by essentially the same<br>
method as described previously (Richardson er al.. 1995). Cellular<br>
proliferation was examined by seeding cells in 96-well microtitre plates at<br>
15.000 cells/well in 0.1 mL of complete medium containing human diferric<br>
Tf (1.25 µM). This seeding density resulted in exponential growth of the<br>
cells throughout of the assay. The cells were allowed to grow overnight and<br>
the chelators were then added in 0.1 mL of complete medium containing<br>
diferric transferrin (1.25 uM). The final concentrations of the chelators were<br>
0.39-50 uM. Control samples contained complete medium and diferric Tf<br>
(1.25 µM). Cells were incubated with the chelators for 90 hrs at 37°C in a<br>
humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO,. After this<br>
incubation. 0.01 mL of MTT was added to each well and the plates incubated<br>
for 2 hrs at 37°C. The cells were solubilized by adding 0.1 mL of 10% SDS-<br>
50% isobutanol in 0.01 M HCl and the plates then read at 570 nm on a<br>
scanning multiwell spectrophotometer (Titertek Multiscan: Beckman<br>
Instruments Inc.. California). As shown previously for the SK-N-MC cell<br>
line. MTT colour formation was directly proportional to the number of viable<br>
cells (Richardson et al.. 1995): The results of the MTT assays are expressed<br>
as a percentage of the control value.<br>
Preparation of 39Fe-Transferrin<br>
Apotransferrin (Sigma Chemical CO.. St. Louis. U.S.A.) was prepared<br>
and labelled with 39Fe (as ferric chloride in 0.1 M HCl. Dupont NEN. MA.<br>
U.S.A.) to produce 39Fe:-transferrin (39Fe-Tf) using standard procedures<br>
described previously (Richardson et al.. 1990). The saturation of Tf with Fe<br>
was monitored by uv-vis spectrophotometry using the absorbance at 280 nm<br>
(protein) compared with that at 456 nm (Fe-binding site). In all experiments,<br>
fully saturated diferric Tf was used.<br>
Effect of the Chelators on 3H-Thymidine. 3H-Leucine and 3H-Uridine<br>
Incorporation<br>
Labelling of cells with 3H-thymidine (20 Ci/mmol: Dupont NEN. MA,<br>
U.S.A.). 3H-uridine (42.7 Ci/mmol/Dupont NEN. MA. U.S.A.) and 3H-leucine<br>
(52 Ci/mmol: Dupont NEN) was estimated after precipitation with<br>
trichloroacetic acid (TCA). After a 20 hr incubation with the chelators. 3H-<br>
leucine. 3H-uridine or 3H-thymidine (1 mCi/ml) were then added for 2 hrs at<br>
37ºC. Subsequently, petri dishes containing cell cultures were placed on ice<br>
and washed four times with ice-cold Hanks balanced salt solution (BSS) and<br>
the cells detached from the plate using 1 MM EDTA in Ca/Mg-free saline.<br>
The cells were then pelleted by centrifugation, the supernatant removed and<br>
the pellet frozen at -70°C. After thawing the cells on ice. 1 ml of ice-cold<br>
20% TCA was added and the solution then vortexed and kept on ice for 1 hr<br>
with periodic mixing. This solution was then centrifuged at 15.000 rpm for<br>
15 mins at 4ºC and the supernatant removed. The pellet was then washed<br>
twice with 1 ml of ice-cold 10% TCA. The pellet was dissolved in 0.5 ml of 1<br>
M NaOH and transferred to scintillation tubes with 3 ml of scintillant.<br>
Radioactivity was measured on a ß-scintillation counter (LKB Wallace,<br>
Finland).<br>
Iron Uptake and Iron Efflux Experiments<br>
The effect of chelators on 39Fe uptake from39Fe-Tf and 39Fe release from<br>
prelabelled cells was studied using standard procedures reported previously<br>
(Richardson et al.. 1994. J. Lab Clin. Med. 124 660-71). The amount of 39Fe<br>
internalized by the cells was measured by incubation with the general<br>
protease pronase (1 mg, ml) for 30 min at 4ºC to remove membrane-bound<br>
39Fe and Tf (Richardson et al.. 1990: Baker et al., 1998. Biochim. Biophys.<br>
Acta 1380 21-30). Control experiments reported in previous studies have<br>
found that this technique is valid for estimation of 39Fe internalization of<br>
cells (Richardson et al.. 1990: Baker et al.. 1998).<br>
Iron Regulatory Protein Gel-Retardation Assay<br>
A gel-retardation assay was used to measure the interaction between<br>
the IRPs and IRE using established techniques (Leibold et al., 1988. Proc.<br>
Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85 2171-5: Milliner et al.. 1989 Cell 58 373-82). Briefly,<br>
after incubation with medium alone (control) or medium containing ferric<br>
ammonium citrate (100 mg/ml: Aldrich Ltd.. Sydney. Australia) or the<br>
chelator. 2- 5 x 10° cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline<br>
(PBS) and lysed at 4°C in 40 µl of ice-cold Munro extraction buffer (10 mM<br>
HEPES. pH 7.6. 3 mM MgCl2. 40 mM KCl. 5% glycerol. 1 MM dithiothreitol<br>
and 0.5% Nonidet P-40). After lysis, the samples were then centrifuged at<br>
10.000 rpm for 3 mins at 4°C to remove nuclei and the supernatant stored at<br>
-70ºC. Frozen cytoplasmic extracts were thawed on ice and then centrifuged<br>
at 15.000 rpm for 10 min at 4ºC. The protein concentration of the soluble<br>
supernatant was determined using the BioRad protein assay (BioRad Ltd..<br>
USA). Samples of cytoplasmic extracts were diluted to a protein<br>
concentration of 100 µg/ml in Munro buffer without Nonidet P-40 and 1 µg<br>
aliquots were analyzed for IEP by incubation with 0.1 ng (approximately 1 x<br>
103 cpm) of 32P-labelled pGL66 RNA transcript (Leibold et al., 1988). The<br>
riboprobe was transcribed in vitro from linearized plasmid templates using<br>
SP6 RNA polymerase in the presence of a-32P LTP (Dupont. NEN). This<br>
latter reaction was performed using the Promega Riboprobe In Vitro<br>
Transcription Kit (Promega. Madison, WL USA). The probe was<br>
subsequently purified on a 6% urea/PAGE gel. To form RNA-protein<br>
complexes, cytoplasmic extracts containing 1µg of protein were incubated for<br>
10 mins at room temperature with the "P-labelled riboprobe. Unprotected<br>
probe was degraded by incubation with 1 U of RNAse T1 for 10 mins at room<br>
temperature. Heparin (Sigma) at a final concentration of 5 mg/ml was then<br>
added and incubated with the extract for another 10 mm at room temperature<br>
to exclude non-specific binding. RNA-protein complexes were analyzed in<br>
6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels at 4°C as described by Konarska et<br>
al., 1986. Cell 46 845-55. Gels were dried, covered in plastic film and<br>
exposed to Kodak XAR films at -70ºC with an intensifying screen.<br>
Northern Blot Analysis<br>
Northern blot analysis was performed by isolating total RNA using the<br>
Total RNA isolation Reagent from Advanced Biotechnologies Ltd (Surrey.<br>
United Kingdom). The RNA (15 µg) was heat denatured at 90ºC for 2 mins in<br>
RNA-loading buffer and then loaded onto a 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel.<br>
After electrophoresis. RNA was transferred to a nylon membrane<br>
(GeneScreen. New England Nuclear. Boston. USA) in 10 x SSC using the<br>
capillary blotting method. The RNA was then cross-linked to the membrane<br>
using a UV-crosslinker (UV Stratalinker 1800. Stragene Ltd.. USA).<br>
The membranes were hybridized with probes specific for human<br>
WAF1. GADD-45 and ß-actin. The VVAF1 probe consisted of a 1 kb fragment<br>
from pSXV(ATTC: Cat. No. 79928). The GADD45 probe consisted of a 760 bp<br>
fragment from human GADD45 cDNA cloned into pHul45B2 (kindly<br>
supplied by Dr. Albert Fornace. National Cancer Institute. NTH. Maryland).<br>
The ß-actin probe consisted of a 1.4 kb fragment from human ß-actin cDNA<br>
cloned into pBluescript SK-(ATCC: at. No 37997).<br>
Hybridization of probes to the membranes and their subsequent<br>
washing were performed as described by Mahmoudi and Lin. 1989.<br>
Biotschniques 7. 331-2 using a Hybaid Shake and Stack Hybridization oven<br>
(Hybaid Ltd.. Middlesex. UK). The membranes were then exposed to Kodak<br>
XAR Films at -70°C with an intensifying screen. The probes were stripped<br>
from the nylon membrane by boiling in a solution containing 10 mM Tris-<br>
HCl (pH 7.0). 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0) and 1% SDS for 15-30 mins as described<br>
by the membrane manufacturer. Densitometric data were collected with a<br>
Laser Densitometer and analyzed by Kodak Biomax Software (Kodak Ltd,<br>
USA).<br>
Reticulocytes<br>
Reticulocytosis was induced by standard procedures (Richardson, DR.,<br>
Ponka. P and Vyoral. D (1996) Blood 87, 3477-3488) in New Zealand white<br>
rabbits by repeated phlebotomy by cardiac puncture using a protocol<br>
approved by the McGill University Animal Care Committee. Reticulocytes<br>
were identified based on staining with new methylene blue, and cell counts<br>
were determined using an improved Neubauer counting chamber.<br>
Labelling of Transferrin<br>
Apotransferrin (Sigma Chemical Co) was prepared and labelled with<br>
39Fe (as ferric chloride in 0.1 M HCl. Dupont NEN. MA. USA) to produce<br>
39Fe2-transferrin (39Fe-Tf) using established methods (Richardson. D R. and<br>
Baker. E (1992) J Biol Chem 267. 13972-13979).<br>
Mobilisation of 39Fe from 3eFe-Loaded Reticulocytes<br>
The 39Fe-labelled rabbit reticulocyte has been shown to be a useful<br>
model to investigate the ability of an Fe chelator to permeate the cell<br>
membrane and chelate intracellular Fe pools. Reticulocytes were obtained<br>
from chronically bled rabbits as described above and were incubated with 1<br>
mM succinylacetone (SA: Sigma) to inhibit heme synthesis. After a 15 min<br>
preincubation in the presence of SA. 39Fe-Tf (3.75 µM) was added and<br>
incubated with the cells for 1 h at 37ºC with shaking. After this incubation<br>
the reticulocytes were washed three times with ice-cold PBS to remove non-<br>
specifically bound 39Fe-Tf. The washed 39Fe-labelled reticulocytes (30-35 µL)<br>
were incubated in buffered salt solution (250 µL final volume) with the<br>
apochelators. The SA was present in all incubations with the chelators to<br>
prevent the utilization of non-heme 39Fe for heme synthesis. After the<br>
incubation. 39Fe was measured both in washed reticulocytes and in the<br>
medium, and the percentage of 39Fe mobilized from the reticulocytes was<br>
then calculated.<br>
In some experiments, washed 39Fe-labelled reticulocytes were lysed<br>
with 200 uL of ice-cold distilled water and the proteins precipitated with 1<br>
ml ice-cold 95% ethanol. The mixture was then centrifuged (13,000 rpm/30<br>
min/4°C) on a IEC Micromax microcentrifuge (IEC Canada) to result in an<br>
ethanol-soluble fraction containing 39Fe-bound to low Mr chelators, and an<br>
ethanol-precipitated fraction containing protein-bound 39Fe. Previous studies<br>
have demonstrated that this method results in the precipitation of 39Fe in<br>
ferritin and transferrin while 39Fe bound to chelators remains in a soluble<br>
form. An increase of 39Fe in the alcohol-soluble fraction shows that the<br>
chelator can cross the cell membrane and form intracellular Fe complexes<br>
which are released with limited efficiency.<br>

The chelators in their free base form were sparingly soluble in water<br>
but are quite soluble in methanol and somewhat less so in ethanol. Upon<br>
protonation of their basic groups, the aqueous solubility of all chelators is<br>
dramatically increased. The hydrochloride salts of PCBBH-HCl and PCTH-<br>
HCl exhibit the lowest aqueous solubility of the series, whereas the most<br>
soluble chelators are PCIH-2HC1 and PCAH-2HC1 (both diprotic acids).<br>
The 1H NMR spectra of the hydrochloride salts in water are quite<br>
similar to those of the corresponding free bases (in methanol). Most<br>
importantly, the imine singlet resonance is observed in all cases, which<br>
indicates that the imine functional group remains intact upon formation of<br>
the hydrochloride salt. Moreover, the protonated chelators do not exhibit<br>
any noticeable imine hydrolysis over a period of a week in aqueous solution<br>
as shown by NMR spectroscopy.<br>
The degree of protonation was dependent on the number of basic<br>
groups present. The isonicotinoyl. p-aminophenyl and 2-pyridyl groups all<br>
underwent protonation. The imine X-atom (a potentially basic site) was not<br>
protonated unless the adjacent heterocycle was itself non-basic (i.e. the furyl<br>
group in FIH). Internal hydrogen bonding of the imine X-atom with the<br>
protonated pyridinium group appears to explain the resistance of the imine to<br>
protonation in these ligands.<br>
Effect of the Chelators on Iron Release from Prelabelled cells and Iron<br>
Uptake from Transferrin<br>
The ability of the PCIH analogues to increase 39Fe release from SK-N-<br>
MC cells was compared to "standard chelators" (DFO. PIH and 311) whose<br>
activity has been previously documented in this cell line. The efflux of 39Fe<br>
from SK-X-MC cells was examined after a 3 hr labelling period with 39Fe-Tf<br>
(0.75 µM) followed by a 3 hr reincubation in the presence and absence of<br>
DFO (100 µM) or the remainder of the ligands at 50 uM (Figure 2A). It ,<br>
should be noted that DFO was screened at 100 µM in all experiments because<br>
of its low Fe chelation efficacy in SK-N-MC cells. Chelators 311. PIH. PCTH.<br>
PCBH and PCBBH showed similar activity resulting in the release of 40-42%<br>
of cellular 39Fe. The mobilization of 39Fe by PCIH was similar to that of DFO<br>
which released 19% of cellular 39Fe. In contrast. FIH. PCAH and PCHH did<br>
not appreciably increase 39Fe mobilization over that observed for the control<br>
medium (Figure 2A).<br>
To determine the ability of the chelators to inhibit 39Fe uptake from<br>
39Fe-Tf (0.75 µM). SK-N-MC cells were incubated for 3 hrs at 37ºC with 39Fe -<br>
and either DFO (100 µM) or the other chelators (50 µM) (Figure 2B). Ligands<br>
311. PIH. PCTH. PCBH and PCBBH showed much greater efficacy than DFO<br>
at preventing 39Fe uptake from 39Fe-Tf (Figure 2B). decreasing it to 13-30% of<br>
the control value respectively, whereas DFO reduced it to 91% of the control<br>
(Figure 2B). In terms of the other chelators. PCIH was slightly more effective<br>
than DFO. while FIH. PCAH and PCHH had no effect on 39Fe uptake from<br>
39Fe-Tf. Considering these data, in both 39Fe uptake and 39Fe efflux studies,<br>
three of the PCIH analogues, namely PCTH. PCBH and PCBBH. showed<br>
activity that was greater than DFO and comparable to PIH and 311 (Figure 2A<br>
and 2B).<br>
To further investigate the efficacy of the most effective PCIH analogues<br>
identified from the screening studies above, the efficacy of PIH. PCIH, PCTH,<br>
PCBH and PCBBH at mobilizing 39Fe from SK-N-MC cells at a range of ligand<br>
concentrations was compared (0.5-50µM; Figure 3A). The mobilization of<br>
39Fe from SK-N-MC cells was examined after a 3 hr labelling period with 39Fe-<br>
Tf (0.75µM) followed by a 3 hr reincubation in the presence and absence of<br>
effective chelators (0.5-50µM: Figure 3A). The 39Fe release mediated by all<br>
chelators was biphasic as a function of chelator concentration, with 39Fe<br>
release beginning to plateau at a ligand concentration of 25 µM. It was<br>
apparent that at chelator concentrations up to 10 µM. the most effective<br>
chelatorsat mobilizing 39Fe were PCTH and PCBBH (Figure 3A). However, as<br>
the ligand concentration was increased up to 25 and 50 µM. the activity of<br>
PCTH and PCBBH became similar to PIH and PCBH. PCIH was the least<br>
effective chelator at all concentrations (Figure 3A).<br>
Further studies examined the effect of chelator concentrations (0.5-50<br>
µM) on the uptake of 39Fe from 39Fe-Tf (0.75 µM) during a 3 hr incubation<br>
(Figure 3B). Similar to the results found in the efflux studies above. PCTH<br>
and PCBBH were the most effective chelators at preventing 39Fe uptake from<br>
39Fe-Tf at ligand concentrations up to 10µM. while at concentrations from 25-<br>
50 µM the activity of PIH. PCIH. PCTH and PCBH were similar (Figure 3B).<br>
Again. PCIH was the least effective chelator at all concentrations examined.<br>
To determine if there were any differences in Fe chelation efficacy of the<br>
ligands between different cell types, the activity of the three most effective<br>
PCIH analogues (PCTH. PCBH and PCBBH) were compared to DFO and 311<br>
in BE-2 neuroblastoma cells. SK-N-MC neuroepithelioma cells and SK-Mel-28<br>
melanoma cells (Tables 1 and 2). Examining the ability of the chelators to<br>
mobilize 39Fe from cells prelabelled for 3 hrs with 39Fe-Tf (0.75 uM) and then<br>
reincubated for 3 hrs. DFO(100 µM) had comparable activity to 311 and the 3<br>
PCIH analogues (50µM) at mobilizing 39Fe from BE-2 cells (Table 1). In<br>
contrast. DFO was far less effective than either 311 or the PCIH analogues at<br>
mobilizing 39Fe from SK-N'-MC or SK-Mel-23 Cells (Table 1).<br>
Table 1. The effect of DFO. 311, PCTH. PCBH, or PCBHH on 39Fe release<br>
from BE-2 neuroblastoma cells, SK-N-MC neuroepithelioma cells, and SK-<br>
Mel-28 melanoma cells. Cells were labeled for 3 h at 37°C with 39Fe-<br>
transferrin (0.75 µM), washed, and then reincubated with the chelators for 3<br>
h at 37°C. The chelators 311. PCTH. PCBH. and PCBBH were screened at 50<br>
µM while DFO was examined at 100 µM. Results are Mean ± SD of three<br>
determinations in a typical experiment.<br>
Table 2. The effect of DFO. 311. PCTH. PCBH. or PCBBH on internalized<br>
39Fe uptake from 39Fe-transferrin by BE-2 neuroblastoma cells, SK-N-MC<br>
neuroepithelioma cells, and SK-Mel-28 melanoma cells. Cells were<br>
incubated with the chelators and 39Fe-transferrin (0.75 µM) for 3 h at 37°C,<br>
washed, and incubated for 30 min at 4°C with pronase (1 mg/ml) to separate<br>
the internalized from the membrane-bound 39Fe. All chelators were screened<br>
at a concentration of 50 µM except for DFO which was examined at 100 µM.<br>
Results are mean ± SD (three determinations) from a typical experiment.<br>
The effect of the chelators at preventing 39Fe uptake from 39Fe-Tf<br>
(0.75µM) after a 3 hr incubation was also examined in the same cell lines<br>
(Table 2). The most effective chelator at inhibiting 39Fe uptake from 39Fe-Tf<br>
was 311. which reduced 39Fe uptake similarly in all 3 cell lines to 8-10% of<br>
the control value. The three PCIH analogues showed less activity than 311<br>
but were far more effective than DFO (Table 2). It is of interest to note that<br>
DFO had little effect at inhibiting 39Fe uptake in both SK-N-MC<br>
neuroepithelioma cells and SK-Mel-28 melanoma cells (100 and 98% of the<br>
control, respectively), whereas it reduced internalised 39Fe uptake from 39Fe-<br>
Tf to 42% of the control in the BE-2 cell line (Table 2). In contrast, the<br>
activity of the 3 PCIH analogues were somewhat similar in all 3 cell lines,<br>
reducing 39Fe uptake from 39Fe-Tf to 15-38% of the control. The only<br>
exception to this was PCBBH. which was much less effective at reducing 39Fe<br>
uptake in SK-Mel-28 cells than either SK-N-MC or BE-2 cells (Table 2).<br>
Effect of the PCIH Analogues on Cellular Proliferation<br>
The studies above have clearly demonstrated that PCBH. PCBBH and<br>
PCTH have Fe chelation efficacy that is comparable to that of PIH or 311 and<br>
greater than that found for DFO. Hence, it was decided to determine the<br>
antiproliferative effects of the PCIH analogues compared to DFO. PIH, and<br>
311 whose activity has been previously characterized. From Figure 4, it is<br>
clear that all of the PCIH analogues have much less effect on proliferation<br>
than chelator 311. which has been shown in previous studies to be potent at<br>
inhibiting the growth of a wide range of neoplastic cell lines. As shown<br>
previously, the ability of DFO to inhibit growth of SK-N-MC cells was far less<br>
than that of 311 (IC30 DFO = 47 µM: IC30 311 = 2µM). Of the PCIH<br>
analogues. PCBBH and PCBH had antiproliferative activity comparable to<br>
that of DFO (IC70 PCBBH = 42 µM: IC50 PCBH = 50 µM). The remaining<br>
PCIH analogues had little effect at inhibiting growth. It is of interest to note<br>
that while PIH. PCTH. PCBH and PCBBH had comparable Fe chelation<br>
activity to 311 in SK-X-MC cells (Figure 2. Tables 1 and 2). their ability to<br>
inhibit proliferation was much less. These results concur with previous<br>
studies which demonstrated that Fe chelation efficacy is not always well<br>
correlated to the ability of a ligand to inhibit proliferation.<br>
Effect of the Chelators on 3H-Thymidine. 3H-Leucine or 3H-Uridine<br>
Incorporation<br>
The effect of the chelators on 'H-thymidine. 3H-leucine or 3H-uridine<br>
incorporation in to SK-N'-MC cells was examined to obtain further<br>
information on the possible mechanisms of action of these ligands (Table 3).<br>
In these experiments, the effect of PCIH analogues have been compared to<br>
DFO and 311. as the antiproliferative activity of these latter compounds has<br>
been previously characterized using SK-N-MC Cells. The PCIH analogues<br>
with the greatest Fe chelation efficacy, namely PCBBH. PCTH and PCBH,<br>
reduced 3H-thymidine incorporation to 33%. 64% and 72% of the control<br>
respectively, which was far less than the inhibition observed with 311 (0.1%<br>
of the control) and similar to that found with PIH (5 2% of the control).<br>
Interestingly, three chelators that showed little Fe chelation efficacy, namely<br>
FIH. PCAH and PCHH (Figure 2) caused a considerable decrease in 3H-<br>
thymidine incorporation to 11-17% of the control value (Table 3).<br>
Table 3. The effect of the chelators on 3H-thymidine. 3H-leucine. or 3H-<br>
uridine incorporation into SK-N-MC neuroepithelioma cells. Cells were<br>
incubated for 20 hr at 37°C with either DFO (100 µM) or the other chelators<br>
(50 µM). Following this, either 3H-thymidine. 3H-leucine. or 3H-uridine (1<br>
µCi/mL) were added and the cells incubated for an additional 2 h at 37°C (see<br>
Methods for details). Results are Mean ± SD (4-5 determinations) from a<br>
typical experiment of 2-4 experiments performed.<br>
Examining the effect of the chelators at inhibiting 3H-leucine and 3H-<br>
uridine incorporation (Table 3). again the most effective chelator was 311.<br>
which reduced their incorporation to 2% and 5% of the control value<br>
respectively. In contrast. PCBH. PCBBH and PCTH. were far less active than<br>
311 at inhibiting 3H-leucine and 3H-uridine incorporation, reducing it to 16-<br>
47% of the control (Table 3). DFO was also less effective than 311 at<br>
inhibiting 3H-leucine and 3H-uridine incorporation, reducing it to 9% and<br>
34% of the control respectively. The 3 PCIH analogues that caused a<br>
considerable decrease in 3H-thymidine incorporation (FIH. PCAH and PCHH)<br>
did not inhibit 3H-leucine and 3H-uridine incorporation to the same extent,<br>
reducing it to between 40-30% of the control value (Table 3).<br>
The Effect of Chelators on the RNA-Binding Activity of the Iron Regulatory<br>
Proteins (IRPs)<br>
An important effect of intracellular Fe depletion using DFO is the<br>
activation of RNA-binding activity of the iron regulatory proteins (IRP's)<br>
(Hentze et al.. 1996. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93 8175-82). While the effect<br>
of DFO on the RNA-binding activity of this protein has been well<br>
characterized, little is known concerning the effect of other Fe chelators such<br>
as the PCIH analogues. The present inventors examined the effect of a 20 hr<br>
incubation with 311. PIH and the PCIH analogues (25 µM) on IRP-RNA<br>
binding activity in SK-N-MC cells. In all experiments. DFO (100 µM) was<br>
used as a positive control to deplete cells of Fe and increase IRP-RNA binding<br>
activity. In contrast, ferric ammonium citrate (FAC: 100 .ug/ml) was used to<br>
donate Fe to cells and reduce IRP-RNA binding. Examining Figure 5. it is<br>
clear that only one major IRP-IRE band is present, which is due to the fact<br>
that human IRP1-IRE and IRP2-IRE complexes co-migrate in non-denaturing<br>
polyacrylamide gels (Chitambar et al. 1995. Cancer Res. 55 4361-66). As<br>
expected, there was an increase in IRP-RNA binding activity following a 20<br>
hr incubation with DFO. whereas after a 20 hr incubation with the Fe donor<br>
FAC. there was an appreciable decrease in IRP-RNA binding activity<br>
compared to the control (Figure 5). In comparison to the control, there was a<br>
marked increase in IRP-RNA binding activity after treatment of cells with<br>
311. PCTH. PCBH and PCBBH (Figure 5). which most likely reflects their<br>
high Fe chelation efficacy (Figures 2 and 3). Surprisingly. PIH and PCIH had<br>
little effect on IRP-RNA binding activity, whereas FIH. PCAH and PCHH<br>
decreased IRP-RNA binding compared to the control (Figure 5). Addition of<br>
ß-mercaptoethanol to the cell lysates demonstrated that there was no change<br>
in the total amount of IRP-RNA binding activity after incubation with the<br>
chelators (date not shown).<br>
Effect of the PCIH Analogues on the Expression of Genes involved in the Cell<br>
Cycle.<br>
Treatment of cells with high concentrations of DFO (150 µM) or much<br>
lower concentrations of 311 (2.5-5µM) resulted in an increase in the<br>
expression of the p53-responsive genes VVAF1 (wild-type activating gene 1)<br>
and GADD45 (growth arrest and DNA damage gene: (Darnell et al.. 1994.<br>
Blood 94 731-792). VVAF-1 is a potent universal inhibitor of cyclin-<br>
dependent kinases and can induce a G1/S arrest and possibly a G2/M arrest.<br>
GADD45 is induced upon DNA damage and can arrest the cell cycle and is<br>
also involved in DNA nucleotide excision repair. While it is known that<br>
DFO. 311 and other Fe chelators can cause cell arrest, little is understood<br>
concerning the changes in gene expression that may play a role in inhibiting<br>
the cell cycle. In the present study, incubation with 311 (25 µM) and to a<br>
lesser extent DFO (100 µM), caused an increase in the levels of both WAF1<br>
and GADD45 mRNA in SK-N-MC cells (Figure 6). Of the PCIH analogues,<br>
only PCBBH markedly increased the level of GADD45 mRNA but not WAF1<br>
mRNA. This latter effect corresponds to the greater anti-proliferative activity<br>
of PCBBH relative to the other PCIH analogues.<br>
Effect of the PCIH Analogues on Mitochondrial Iron Mobilization in<br>
Reticulocytes<br>
In this investigation Fe chelation efficacy of PCIH analogues was<br>
studied using the only well characterised model of mitochondrial Fe<br>
overload, that is reticulocytes loaded with mitochondrial non-heme 39Fe. In<br>
all studies. PIH was used as the reference compound as this chelator has<br>
been characterized in previous studies to effectively deplete the non-heme<br>
mitochondrial Fe pool.<br>
In initial studies the effect of reincubation time on 39Fe release from<br>
Fe-loaded reticulocytes was assessed (Figure 7). In these experiments, cells<br>
were labelled with 39Fe-Tf for 1 h at 37ºC. washed, and then reincubated for<br>
up to 240 min in the presence and absence of the chelators (200 µM). Of the<br>
eight compounds examined. PCIH was the most effective at increasing<br>
cellular 39Fe release as a function of incubation time (Figure 7). Indeed. PCIH<br>
was more effective than PIH during incubation periods from 15-120 min. but<br>
had similar activity after a 240 min reincubation. The high activity of PCIH<br>
is evident after only 15 min incubation with 39Fe-loaded reticulocytes, at<br>
which point the compound had mobilized 21 ± 1 % (3 determinations) of<br>
cellular 39Fe (Figure 7). The amount of 39Fe released by PCIH after 15 min<br>
was more than that mobilized by PCBBH. PCAH. PCHH. and FIH after 240<br>
min of incubation viz. 17%. 15%. 6%. and 4% respectively. Examination of<br>
the ethanol-soluble intracellular 39Fe after incubation with the chelators<br>
revealed that this only increased in the presence of FIH (Figure 8). suggesting<br>
the possible accumulation of its 39Fe complex within the cell.<br>
In further studies, the effect of chelator concentration was assessed on<br>
39Fe mobilization from 39Fe-loaded reticulocytes. In these experiments, the<br>
cells were labelled with 39Fe-Tf for 1 h at 37ºC. washed, and then reincubated<br>
for 1 h at 37ºC in the presence and absence of the chelators (Figure 9). Again,<br>
PCIH was the most active compound. At a concentration of 200 µM. PCIH<br>
released 31 ± 1 % (3 determinations) of cellular 39Fe compared to PIH that<br>
mobilized 18 ± 1% (3 determinations). The compound PCTH had similar Fe<br>
chelation efficacy as PIH. while the remaining ligands were substantially less<br>
efficient. As described previously. DFO even at high concentrations up to 5<br>
mM had little effect on mobilizing 39Fe, having activity similar to that<br>
observed with control medium. As reported using the SK-N'-MC<br>
neuroepithelioma cell line, both FIH and PCHH showed very low activity at<br>
mobilizing intracellular 39Fe (Figure 9). As shown in Figure 8. an increase in<br>
ethanol-soluble intracellular 39Fe was only observed with FIH and this<br>
increased as the concentration increased up to 200 µM.<br>
CONCLUSION'S<br>
The present inventors have synthesized and screened a number of<br>
aroylhydrazone ligands based upon 2-pyridylcarboxaldehyde isonicotinoyl<br>
hydrazone (PCIH). Three of these chelators, namely PCBH. PCBBH and<br>
PCTH. showed Fe chelation activity that was greater than DFO and<br>
comparable to that of PIH and 311. In addition, the antiproliferative activity<br>
of these chelators was far less than that found for analogue 311. an<br>
aroylhydrazone ligand previously shown to possess high cytotoxic activity.<br>
These properties suggest that these three PCIH analogues would be more<br>
appropriate for the treatment of Fe-loading diseases rather than as anti-<br>
proliferative agents against cancer.<br>
It was attempted to synthesize ligands with high anti-proliferative<br>
activity by condensing 2-pyridylcarboxaldehyde with a range of acid<br>
hydrazides previously used in the synthesis of the PIH analogues. The 2-<br>
pyridylcarboxaldehyde moiety was examined because when it is condensed<br>
with thiosemicarbazide to form the relevant thiosemicarbazone. this ligand<br>
has potent anti-proliferative activity. In fact, this latter group of a-N-<br>
heterocyclic carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazones have been described as the<br>
most effective ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors yet identified. The present<br>
results demonstrate that the PCIH analogues show little anti-proliferative<br>
activity being far less effective than 311. These data may indicate that in<br>
contrast to the 2-pyridylcarboxaldehyde moiety, the thiosemicarbazide<br>
component of the 2-pyridylcarboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazones may be<br>
important for antiproliferative activity.<br>
All of the PCIH analogues examined in the present investigation,<br>
except FIH. have the same potential Fe ligating sites, namely the carbonyl<br>
oxygen, aldimine nitrogen and 2-pyridyl nitrogen (Figure 1). It is of interest,<br>
however, that the biological activity of these ligands can be markedly<br>
influenced by the nature of the substituents placed distal to the Fe-binding<br>
site. For example, both PCHH and PCAH display very poor Fe chelation<br>
activity, while PCTH. PCBBH and PCBH show very high efficacy (Figures 2A.<br>
2B). Since lipophilicity is an important criterion for the membrane<br>
permeability and Fe chelation efficacy of ligands. it may be that the<br>
increased hydrophilicity of PCHH and PCAH (due to the presence of a<br>
hydroxyl and amino group respectively) could prevent the access of these<br>
chelators to intracellular Fe pools. While PCAH. PCHH and FIH showed<br>
little ability to mobilize 39Fe and inhibit 39Fe uptake from 39Fe-Tf. it was of<br>
interest that these chelators were more effective than the other PCIH<br>
analogues at inhibiting 3H-thymidine incorporation (Table 3). Considering<br>
this, it is possible that FIH. PCAH and PCHH may be relatively more efficient<br>
at inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase, a crucial Fe-containing enzyme that is<br>
involved in the conversion of ribonucleotides into deoxyribonucleotides for<br>
DNA synthesis.<br>
One advantage of the PCIH analogues according to the present<br>
invention in comparison to the PIH analogues was their higher solubility in<br>
aqueous solutions. While lipophilicity is an important property for<br>
membrane permeability, the solubility of a chelator in water is also an<br>
important factor in terms of its practical and clinical use. Hence, for a<br>
chelator to be employed as a useful therapeutic agent, an appropriate balance<br>
between solubility in aqueous solutions and the ability to permeate biological<br>
membranes must be reached. For several of the PCIH analogues, this appears<br>
to have been achieved.<br>
The effect of DFO at increasing the RXA-binding activity of the IRPs<br>
has been well characterized. Little is known, however, concerning the effect<br>
of other Fe chelators. The fact that 311. PCTH. PCBH and PCBBH all<br>
increased IRP-RXA binding activity in a similar way to DFO (Figure 5) may<br>
suggest that these ligands act on the same or a similar intracellular pool of<br>
Fe. In contrast to expectations. PIH and PCIH had no effect at increasing IRP-<br>
RNA binding activity despite the fact that these chelators were highly<br>
effective at mobilizing 39Fe from cells and preventing 39Fe uptake from 38Fe-Tf<br>
(Figures 2 and 3). Higher concentrations of PIH did increase IRP-RNA<br>
binding activity, however, suggesting that a concentration effect may be<br>
involved. It is also of interest to note that FIH. PCAH and PCHH inhibited<br>
IRP-RNA binding activity to a level comparable to that found after incubation<br>
with FAC (Figure 5). Considering these results, it can be speculated that<br>
PCAH. PCHH and FIH may disturb the intracellular distribution of Fe. such<br>
that there is an increase in the Fe pool sensed by the IRPs.<br>
While ability of Fe chelators to inhibit the cell cycle at GvS is well<br>
known, very little is understood about the changes in gene expression that<br>
may play a role in this process. In a previous study using neuroblastoma cell<br>
lines and K562 cells, the present inventors demonstrated that incubation<br>
with DFO (150 µM) or 311 (2.5-5 µM) resulted in a marked increase in the<br>
expression of WAF1 and GADD45. two molecules that play key roles in<br>
inducing cell cycle arrest at GvS. In the present study, it has been confirmed<br>
these results using DFO and 311 and have shown that of the PCIH analogues,<br>
only PCBBH increased the expression of GADD45 RNA (Figure 6). The<br>
ability of a chelator to increase the expression of molecules involved in<br>
inhibiting the cell cycle is not an appropriate characteristic of a compound to<br>
be used of treating Fe overload.<br>
Considering this, and the fact that PCBBH was the most effective<br>
ligand at inhibiting proliferation. PCTH and PCBH appear to be preferable<br>
candidate chelators for the treatment of Fe-loading diseases.<br>
In the present work, all of the PCIH analogues showed far less anti-<br>
proliferative activity than 311 (see Figure 4).. despite the high Fe chelation<br>
efficacy of some of these compounds, e.g. PCBBH. PCBH and PCTH (Figures<br>
2 and 3). The present inventors have shown that when the Fe complex of<br>
311 is prepared, it prevents its antiproliferative activity and also its ability to<br>
increase the expression of GADD45 and WAFl rnRNA. These results,<br>
together with its high Fe chelation efficacy, suggests that 311 inhibits growth<br>
by depleting intracellular Fe pools.<br>
Several studies have suggested that Friedreich's ataxia may be caused<br>
bv an accumulation of Fe in the mitochondrion. If this latter disease is<br>
caused by mitochondrial Fe overload, possible treatment regimes could<br>
include Fe chelation therapy. DFO effectively depletes cytosolic Fe pools,<br>
but is unknown whether it can chelate mitochondrial Fe. In contrast,<br>
previous studies have shown that aroylhydrazone chelators, such as PIH, can<br>
remove Fe from the mitochondrion.<br>
It will also be apparent that the PCIH analogues according to the<br>
present invention may also include these compounds in their free base form<br>
as well as their hydrochloride salts and the synthesis of the bases and salts is<br>
discussed hereinafter.<br>
At present, there is no treatment for FA which is a severe crippling<br>
neurological condition. The exciting finding that mitochondrial Fe<br>
accumulation may play an important role in its pathogenesis suggests that a<br>
possible therapeutic intervention may be Fe chelation therapy. This study<br>
identifies some of the PCIH class of chelators as highly effective ligands for<br>
mobilizing mitochondrial non-heme Fe from reticulocytes. This latter model<br>
was implemented as it is the only well characterized system of mitochondrial<br>
Fe overload in cells. The ability of PCIH and PCTH to mobilize mitochondria<br>
Fe pools overcomes the disadvantage of DFO that cannot effectively deplete<br>
Fe from this compartment. These studies complement the work<br>
demonstrating the high chelation efficacy and low toxicity of the PCIH group<br>
of ligands in the SK-N-MC neuroepithelioma cell line. Indeed, some of these<br>
compounds were far more efficient than DFO at increasing Fe mobilization<br>
from cells and preventing Fe uptake from Tf.<br>
The PCIH class of chelators were specifically designed based upon<br>
studies on a wide range of compounds of the PIH class. From these studies,<br>
structural features necessary for high Fe chelation efficacy and low toxicity<br>
were chosen to optimise the use of these ligands as agents to treat Fe-<br>
overload disease. Indeed, the design strategy has been very successful, as it<br>
has resulted in chelators that show higher activity than the parent compound<br>
PIH.<br>
The strategy to design new chelators derived from PIH was based upon<br>
the advantageous properties of this compound. These are: (a) oral<br>
effectiveness: (b) near optimal hydrophilic-lipophilic balance: (c) high<br>
specificity and selectivity for Fe; (d) predominantly neutral at physiological<br>
pH: (e) economical and simple to synthesize: and (f) high chelation efficacy<br>
both in vitro and in vivo.<br>
The reason for the ability of some of the PCIH ligands to mobilize<br>
mitochondrial Fe may be their much higher lipophilicity in comparison to<br>
DFO. Indeed, to permeate the mitochondrion and chelate Fe. three lipid<br>
membranes need to be transversed. viz.. the plasma membrane and the inner<br>
and outer mitochondrial membranes. Accordingly, a lipophilic chelator that<br>
rapidly permeates membranes and targets mitochondrial Fe will be far more<br>
effective than a hydrophilic compound such as DFO. This may be an<br>
important property of the analogue, since the Fe-loading in FA is not<br>
pronounced as that found in untreated ß-thalassemia. Hence, only very short<br>
durations of therapy may be possible or necessary in order to prevent overall<br>
body Fe depletion. Under these conditions specific targeting of<br>
mitochondrial Fe pools could be an important property.<br>
It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that numerous<br>
variations and/or modifications may be made to the invention as shown in<br>
the specific embodiments without departing from the spirit or scope of the<br>
invention as broadly described. The present embodiments are. therefore, to<br>
