				<td>METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF CONJUGATED<br>
TAXANE IN FOLYGLUTAMIC ACID-TAXANE CONJUGATES<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Paclitaxel (available on the market as Taxol® Injection) is the prototype<br>
of chemotherapeutic taxanes, which binds to β-tubulin, promotes the assembly<br>
of this protein into microtubules and stabilizes them, eventually causing cell<br>
death. Paclitaxel poliglumex (PPX, chemical name N-(L-pyroglutamyl)-<br>
[poly(L-glutamyl)]-L-glutamic acid partially γ-esterified with (2'R,3'S)-3'-<br>
benzoylamido-r-[[4s10β-bis(acetoxy)-2α-(benzoyloxy)-1,7β-dihydroxy-9-<br>
oxo-5,20-epoxytax-11-en-13α-yl]oxy]-1'-oxo-3'-phenylpropan-2'-ol),<br>
hereinafter referred to as PPX, is the ester conjugate of α-poly-L-glutamic acid<br>
(PGA) and paclitaxel wherein the latter is covalently bound to PGA through<br>
the 2'-hydroxy position.<br>
PPX is currently under study for use in non-small cell lung cancer<br>
(NSCLC) and ovarian cancer. Paclitaxel is released after uptake and<br>
proteolytic/hydrolytic degradation of the conjugate in a tumor tissue.<br>
The molecular formula and molecular weight of PPX are distributions<br>
because the polymerization degree of a-poly-L-glutamic acid and the number<br>
of conjugation sites with paclitaxel vary according to the manufacturing<br>
process. The average molecular mass of PPX is approximately 40,000<br>
Daltons, determined by non-aqueous gel permeation chromatography with<br>
detection by multi angle laser light scattering. Approximately 35% by weight<br>
paclitaxel is present in the bound form in the conjugate, which amounts to<br>
about one paclitaxel ester linkage per 11 monomer units. Methods for the<br>
synthesis of PPX are disclosed in PCT publication W097/33552.<br>
Among manufacturing tests to be performed on PPX, both as active<br>
ingredient and as finished pharmaceutical product, assays for the quantification<br><br>
of conjugated paclitaxel and related taxane-based impurities are prescribed.<br>
However, the latter assay cannot be carried out on PPX as such and<br>
deesterification is required to liberate paclitaxel. Tetrahedron Letters, (1995),<br>
36(12), 2001-2004 discloses a procedure for the hydrolytic cleavage of various<br>
esters of paclitaxel using basic hydrogen peroxide/tetrahydrofuran mixtures,<br>
wherein the 2'-acetate of peracetylated paclitaxel is hydrolyzed faster than the<br>
10-acetyl position. When this method is applied to paclitaxel, the reported<br>
product is 10-deacetylpaclitaxel (10-DAT). A known procedure initially<br>
employed for the quantification of conjugated paclitaxel and related taxane<br>
impurities in PPX comprises exhaustive aqueous hydrolysis of PPX with sodium<br>
bicarbonate/peroxide with concomitant extraction of paclitaxel and related taxane<br>
impurities in CHCl3 and quantification by HPLC. The addition of CHCl3 as a<br>
second phase allows for extraction of the liberated taxanes immediately after<br>
hydrolysis, preventing most of the 10-DAT formation. The hydrolysis reaction,<br>
however, causes significant degradation of paclitaxel, principally to 10-deacetyl-<br>
paclitaxel (10-DAT) and 20% levels of 10-DAT were common using this<br>
method, as the biphasic system did not completely suppress hydrolysis at the 10<br>
position. As a result, the peaks of both paclitaxel and 10-DAT are quantified<br>
together and reported as paclitaxel+10-DAT. To be able to correct the amount of<br>
paclitaxel- 10-DAT obtained from the hydrolysis method to total paclitaxel only,<br>
a second method using NMR quantification needs to be performed to quantify the<br>
amount of indigenous conjugated 10-DAT. Thus, the formation of degradation<br>
products and the change of the conjugated taxane profile is a clear drawback of<br>
this procedure. Moreover, the chromatographic conditions are not specific for the<br>
degradation compound.<br>
There is therefore the need for an improved method for the quantification<br>
of PGA-conjugated paclitaxel and other PGA-conjugated taxanes.<br><br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a method for determining<br>
the amount of conjugated taxane in PGA-taxane conjugates which comprises<br>
the hydrolysis of the conjugate in a non-aqueous medium, using a hydrazine-<br>
derivative in place of the hydroperoxy anion.<br>
In greater detail, the method of the invention comprises the reaction of a<br>
PGA-taxane conjugate with a compound formula (I):<br>
R1R2N-NH2<br>
(I)<br>
wherein<br>
R1 and R2 are independently selected from C1-C10-alkyl, C1-C10-<br>
hydroxyalkyl, C3-C10 alkenyl, C3-C10-hydroxyalkenyl, C3-C10-alkynyl, C3-C10-<br>
hydroxyalkynyl, aryl, heteroaryl; or R1 and R2 taken together with the nitrogen<br>
atom to which they are linked form a 3-8 membered heterocyclic ring<br>
optionally containing up to three heteroatoms selected form O, S and N and<br>
optionally substituted with up to two hydroxy groups;<br>
to give unbound taxanes and a PGA-hydrazide<br>
followed by determination of the unbound taxane.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, a PGA-taxane conjugate is an<br>
α-poly-L-glutamic acid (PGA) wherein one or more γ-carboxy groups of the<br>
glutamic acid repeating unit are esterified with a taxane molecule through the<br>
2'-hydroxy group of the latter. Typically, PGA contains from 60 to 310<br>
monomer units and has a molecular mass ranging from 8,000 to 40,000<br>
Dalton. A PGA-hydrazide is a hydrazide resulting from the reaction of the<br>
ester groups linking the 2'-hydroxy groups of the taxane to the y-carboxy<br>
groups of the glutamic acid repeating units of PGA in the PGA-taxane<br>
conjugate with the hydrazine of formula (I). In the PGA-hydrazide, the<br>
nitrogen of the primary amino group of the compound of formula (I) is bound<br><br>
to the carbonyl of the γ-carboxy group of the glutamic acid repeating unit of<br>
PGA.<br>

the invention, a sample of PPX or of a PPX-containing medicament is<br>
dissolved or suspended in dimethylformamide or dimethylsulfoxide to provide<br>
a concentration of PPX between 25 and 52 mg/ml, then<br>
4-aminomorpholine or a solution of 4-aminomorpholine in trifluoroacetic acid<br>
is added. The ratio between the PPX solution and<br>
4-aminomorpholine/trifluoroacetic acid is between 1:0.3 v/v and 1:0.5 v/v.<br>
The mixture is stirred at a temperature between about 20°C and about 42°C<br>
for a time ranging from about 2 hours to about 24 hours.<br>
The determination of the unbound taxane can be carried out by HPLC<br>
or by any other methods known in the art for the quantitative analysis of<br>

According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, a PPX sample or<br>
of a PPX-containing medicament is dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide to provide<br>
a concentration of PPX between 48 and 52 ng/ml and a solution of<br>
4-aminomorpholine in trifluoroacetic acid is added wherein the ratio of<br>
trifluoroacetic acid to 4-aminomorpholine is 0.017:1 v/v. The ratio of PPX<br>
solution to 4-aminomorpholine/trifluoroacetic acid is 1:0.5 v/v. The mixture is<br>
stirred and temperature and reaction time are monitored until approximately<br><br>
2% - 7% of the conjugated taxane is released. Preferably, the temperature is<br>
maintained in the range of about 38-42°C and the reaction time ranges from<br>
about 1.9 to about 2.1 hours. Within these ranges the purity profile does not<br>
change as a function of conversion. After addition of acetonitrile the solution<br>
is ultrafiltered by centrifugation to remove the unreacted polymer and then<br>
directly injected into a HPLC column to determine the percent area of<br>
paclitaxel and of each taxanes impurity. UV response factors reported in the<br>
USP or calculated are applied to transform the % area of known impurities in<br>
w/w % relative to paclitaxel; the amount of other unknown impurities is<br>
instead calculated as % area. Paclitaxel's purity is calculated by subtracting<br>
the sum of all impurities from 100%.<br>
The mild reaction conditions of the method of the invention reduce the<br>
amount of paclitaxel degradation from about 20% to less than 0.5% and allow for<br>
the quantification of 10-DAT above 0.2%, thereby eliminating the need for NMR<br>
quantification.<br>
The invention will be now illustrated in greater detail by means of the<br>
following examples.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
To demonstrate the accuracy and sensitivity of the method of the<br>
invention, paclitaxel was spiked with a known amount (10% w/w) of three<br>
chemically different taxanes and then conjugated to α-poly-(L)-glutamic acid in<br>
amount of 37% w/w. Two of the three taxanes were synthetic impurities<br>
(cephalomannine and 7-epi-cephalomannine), the third was a degradation<br>
impurity (7-epipaclitaxel). Three different spiking levels (1.2%, 9.8%, 28% w/w)<br>
were investigated for each taxane in the range within the quantitation limit and<br>
the upper specification limit. All three impurities were recovered in amount<br>
between 100% and 115%, which was deemed to be acceptable for the intended<br><br>
use of the method. A representative example of this experiment is given in<br>
Example 1. The routine release analysis of a PPX batch is reported in Example 2.<br>
Example 1<br>
A solution of paclitaxel/7-epipaclitaxel conjugate was prepared by<br>
accurately weighting 350 ± 5 mg of the conjugate in a 10 mL flask and dissolving<br>
with dimethylsulfoxide. The solution was diluted to volume with the same<br>
solvent. 250 ± 2.5 mg of PPX (Pharmaceutical Grade) were accurately weighed<br>
in a 5 mL flask. 0.085 mL of the spiking solution (corresponding to a spiking<br>
level of 1.2% w/w) was added in the same flask and diluted to volume with<br>
dimethylsulfoxide. The aminolysis reaction was then performed according to the<br>
general procedure given in Example 2 and analysed by HPLC. Recovery of 7-<br>
epipaclitaxel was 110.7%.<br>
Example 2<br>
250 mg of PPX (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient), accurately weighed,<br>
were transferred into a 5 mL flask. After dissolution with dimethylsulfoxide the<br>
sample was diluted to volume with the same solvent. 1.0 mL of this solution was<br>
transferred into a 5 mL conical bottom vial. A triangular magnetic stirring bar<br>
was placed in each vial and 0.5 mL of a solution comprised of trifluoroacetic acid<br>
and 4-aminomorpholine in a ratio of 0.017:1 (0.034 mL of TFA added to 2.0 mL<br>
of 4-aminomorpholine) were added. The vial was tightly capped, placed on a<br>
thermostated stirring water bath at 40°C ± 2°C and stirred for 2 ± 0.1 hours. At<br>
the end of the reaction the vial was allowed to cool slowly to room temperature<br>
over about 10 minutes before addition of 0.75 mL of acetonitrile. After mixing,<br>
the sample was transferred to centrifuge filters (molecular mass cut-off = 10,000<br>
daltons) and centrifuged for 1 hour at 3000 x g. 1 mL of the sample was<br>
transferred to an HPLC vial, added with 10 µL of glacial acetic acid and analyzed<br>
by HPLC for the determination of the taxane content using a Zorbax 300SB-C8<br>
column, 4.6x100mm 3.5um, Agilent Cat. No. 861973-906, maintained at 40° C<br><br>
and eluting with a water/acetonitrile gradient mixture from 20% acetonitrile/80%<br>
water to 90% acetonitrile 10% water in 60 minutes, with UV detection at 227 nm.<br>
The results (average of six replicates and expressed as area % corrected for<br>
the Relative Response Factor) are reported in Table 1.<br>
