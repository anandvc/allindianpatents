				<td>BACKGROUND AND FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a cleaning system which uses mobile cleaning elements for cleaning<br>
the inside of tubing.<br>
A heat distributing system typically has a condenser unit which includes tubing to conduct<br>
fluids. There have been proposed different ways of cleaning the inside of such tubing to<br>
prevent the build up of dirt or other unwanted deposits inside the tubing as the fluids travel<br>
through the tubing.<br>
One proposed way is the use of cleaning balls made of rubber or spongy material which have<br>
a diameter slightly larger than the tubing so that when they travel through the tubing with the<br>
fluid, the balls are compressed. In this way, the balls are made to rub against the walls of the<br>
tubing so as to keep the walls clean and substantially free from deposits. Generally, the balls<br>
and the fluid are passed through the tubing, in the direction of the fluid flow, from the<br>
upstream side to the downstream side of the tubing. The balls are then separated from the<br>
fluid at the downstream side and then recirculated back to the upstream side of the tubing. A<br>
pump, such as that described in patent document US6, 070, 652, typically provides the means<br>
to recirculate the balls.<br>
However, a disadvantage of using a pump to recirculate the balls is that the pump is<br>
susceptible to malfunctioning and such a system usually requires considerable downtime for<br>
maintenance and repair.<br>
To overcome the above disadvantage, there has been proposed a cleaning system that does not<br>
use a pump to recirculate the balls, an example of which is described in patent document US<br>
5,592, 990. In this prior art, the recirculating means comprises a housing disposed between<br>
the upstream and downstream side of the tubing. The housing includes an apertured partition<br>
which divides the housing into a upper compartment and a lower compartment. When the<br>
balls are recirculated and collected by this housing, the partition permits the fluid to pass<br>
through to the lower compartment while keeping the balls in the upper compartment. The<br>
housing further comprises a first passageway which connects one end of the upper<br><br>
compartment to the downstream side of the tubing, a second and third passageway connecting<br>
the other end of the upper compartment to a first and second section in the upstream side of<br>
the tubing such that the second section of the tubing has a slightly lower pressure compared to<br>
the pressure at the first section but higher than that at the downstream side of the tubing. The<br>
housing also comprises a fourth passageway connecting the lower compartment to a source of<br>
lower pressure than that in any of three other passageways. The cleaning system disclosed in<br>
this prior art also has a plurality of valves arranged to control the fluid flow along the different<br>
passageways described above. A disadvantage of this prior art is the complexity of the design<br>
which requires a sequence of actions to close and open the plurality of valves to recirculate<br>
the balls. In addition, to draw the balls into the housing, the valve disposed at the fourth<br>
passageway must be opened and this may discharge the fluid. As a result, the fluid is wasted<br>
each time the balls are recirculated and the cost of maintaining such a system may be<br>
relatively expensive.<br>
It is an object of this invention to provide a cleaning system which alleviates at least one of<br>
the disadvantages of the prior art.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention, in general terms, is to provide a system for cleaning tubing connected to an<br>
inlet pipe and an outlet pipe, using cleaning elements, such as cleaning balls, which are<br>
recirculated by controlling the opening and closing of two valves.<br>
A first object of the invention is a system for cleaning tubing used for conducting a fluid<br>
therethrough, the tubing being connected to an inlet pipe and an outlet pipe, the system having<br>
a plurality of cleaning balls for circulating with the fluid through the tubing; a separator<br>
disposed at the outlet pipe and arranged to separate the cleaning balls from the fluid ; a<br>
recirculating means comprising a housing arranged to collect the cleaning balls, the housing<br>
having a first and second compartment separated by an apertured partition, the apertured<br>
partition arranged to allow the fluid to pass through to the second compartment but not the<br>
cleaning balls ; a ball supply pipe having an entrance coupled to a first opening on the first<br>
compartment of the housing and an exit coupled to a first opening on the inlet pipe; a fluid<br><br>
supply pipe having an entrance coupled to a second opening on the inlet pipe and an exit<br>
coupled to a second opening on the first compartment of the housing; a fluid return pipe<br>

exit coupled to an opening on the outlet pipe; a ball return pipe having an entrance coupled to<br>
an opening on the separator and an exit coupled to a third opening on the first compartment of<br>
the housing; a means for supply of cleaning balls to the inlet pipe whereby a high pressure is<br>
formed at the entrance of the fluid supply pipe and a low pressure is formed at the exit of the<br>
ball supply pipe, the difference in pressure causing a transfer of cleaning balls from the<br>
housing to the inlet pipe; and a means for a return of cleaning balls to the housing whereby a<br>
high pressure is formed at the entrance of the ball return pipe and a low pressure is formed at<br>
the exit of the fluid return pipe, the difference in pressure causing a transfer of cleaning balls<br>
from the separator back to the housing wherein the recirculating means, means for supply of<br>
cleaning elements and means for return of cleaning balls are arranged to selectively transfer<br>
the plurality of cleaning balls from the inlet pipe to the outlet pipe.<br>
Preferably the recirculating means in the cleaning system further comprises a first valve<br>
disposed along the fluid supply pipe, a second valve disposed along the fluid return pipe, a<br>

along the ball return pipe; the first one-way valve being operative to transfer the cleaning<br>
elements from the housing to the inlet pipe and the second one-way valve being operative to<br>
transfer the cleaning balls from the separator to the housing.<br>
Preferably the recirculating means in the cleaning system further comprises a third valve<br>
disposed along the ball return pipe and a fourth valve disposed along the ball supply pipe.<br>
Preferably the means for supply of cleaning balls in a cleaning system is operative by opening<br>
of the first valve and keeping the second valve closed creating a high pressure at the entrance<br>
of the fluid supply pipe and a low pressure at the exit of the ball supply pipe, the high pressure<br>
creating a suction force to draw the fluid from the inlet pipe into the housing through the fluid<br>
supply pipe, the force of the fluid flowing through the housing carrying the cleaning balls<br>
from the housing through the first one way valve, into the ball supply pipe in which the fourth<br>
valve remains opened, causing the cleaning balls to flow into the inlet duct.<br><br>
Preferably the means for return of cleaning balls in a cleaning system is by operative by<br>
opening of the second valve and keeping the first valve closed creating a high pressure at the<br>
entrance of the ball return pipe and a low pressure at the exit of the fluid return pipe, the high<br>
pressure creating a suction force to draw the fluid and the cleaning balls from the separator<br>
through the second one way valve and into the ball return pipe, the force of the fluid carrying<br>
the cleaning balls through the second one-way valve, into the ball return pipe into the<br>
housing, wherein said cleaning balls are retained in the housing while the fluid flows through<br>
the apertured partition in the housing to return to the fluid return pipe in which the second<br>
valve remains opened, and into the outlet duct.<br>
Preferably the cleaning system has a separator in a shape of a funnel.<br>
Preferably the separator in the cleaning system comprises perforations which allow the fluid<br>
to flow through but not the cleaning balls.<br>
Preferably the perforations of the separator are in the form of rectangular slots each having a<br>
length direction.<br>
Preferably the length directions of the rectangular slots of the separator are not parallel to the<br>
centre axis of the funnel.<br>
Preferably the cleaning system has a first means to rotate the fluid and the cleaning balls at the<br>
inlet pipe before the tubing so that the cleaning balls enter the tubing randomly distributed.<br>
Preferably the cleaning system has a second means to rotate the fluid and the cleaning balls is<br>
at the outlet pipe before the separator so that the dirt accumulated on the surface of the<br>
cleaning balls in its passage through the tubing is loosened from the surface of the cleaning<br>
balls and carried away in the fluid.<br>
Preferably the direction of the means to rotate the fluid and cleaning balls is opposite to the<br>
length direction of the rectangular slots.<br><br>
An advantage of the described embodiment of the invention is that the different pressures at<br>
the inlet pipe and the outlet pipe create suction force which provides an easy and cost efficient<br>
way of circulating the cleaning balls for cleaning the tubing. Such a system is also<br>
environmental friendly since there is no wastage of the fluid.<br>
The invention is particularly useful for cleaning the fluid-conducting tubing of a heat-<br>
exchanger or a condenser, and the invention is therefore described below with respect to such<br>
an application.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a cleaning system used to clean tubing 8 in a condenser 7. The tubing 8 is<br>
in the form of a plurality of parallel spaced tubes which are connected to an inlet pipe 5 and<br>
an outlet pipe 9. A cooling fluid such as water is passed through the tubing 8 in order to<br>
condense another fluid, such as steam or a refrigerant gas, from an inlet 25 which circulates<br>
through the spaces between the tubing 8 and to an outlet 29.<br>
The cooling fluid (in a direction as indicated by WI) is circulated through the condenser<br>
tubing 8 from an inlet duct 1, which is connected to the upstream side of the condenser tubing<br>
8 by the inlet pipe 5, to an outlet duct 15 connected to the downstream side of the tubing 8 by<br>
the outlet pipe 9.<br>
The cleaning system comprises a plurality of cleaning elements and in this embodiment<br>
cleaning balls 20 are used. Such cleaning balls 20 are typically made from spongy material<br>
and have a diameter slightly larger than the diameter of the tubing 8 so that the balls 20 are<br>
compressed when they are forced through the tubing 8 to prevent the lodging or settling of<br>
particles within the tubing 8. In this way, unwanted deposits are prevented from building up<br>
in the tubing 8 which may lower the efficiency of the heat exchange, or even cause corrosion.<br>
The cleaning system further comprises a separator 12 and recirculating means to transfer the<br>
cleaning balls 20 from the outlet pipe 9 to the inlet pipe 5.<br>
The function of the separator 12 is to separate the cleaning balls 20 from the cooling fluid at<br>
the outlet pipe 9 and in this embodiment, the separator 12 has a shape of a funnel. The<br>
separator 12 is interposed between the outlet pipe 9 and the outlet duct 15 which releases the<br>
fluid. The separator 12 comprises perforations arranged to allow the fluid to pass through to<br>
the outlet duct 15 but not the cleaning balls 20.<br>
Preferably, the perforations are in the form of rectangular slots 32 having a length direction<br>
inclined in a particular direction, for example anti-clockwise, as viewed in the fluid flow<br>
direction. Detailed views of the separator 12 according to this embodiment and the<br>
rectangular slots 32 are shown in Figures 5 and 6, respectively. The separator 12 is connected<br><br>
to the recirculating means for transferring the cleaning balls 20 from the outlet pipe 9 to the<br>
inlet pipe 5.<br>
In this embodiment, the recirculating means comprises a housing 21 for collecting the<br>
cleaning balls 20. The housing 21 has an apertured partition 28 dividing the interior of the<br>
housing 21 into an first compartment 19 and a second compartment 27 on opposite sides of<br>
the partition 28. The partition 28 permits the fluid, but not the cleaning balls 20, to pass<br>
through so that the cleaning balls 20 accumulate within the first compartment 19. The housing<br>
21 may further include a cover 18 for covering the first compartment 19 and which is<br>
removable therefrom in order to add or remove the cleaning BALLS 20.<br>
The recirculating means further comprises a fluid return pipe 16 and a ball return pipe 17. The<br>
fluid return pipe 16 is used to connect the housing 21 to the outlet duct 15 for transferring the<br>
fluid (not the cleaning balls 20) from the housing 21 to the outlet duct 15. The fluid return<br>
pipe 16 has an entrance 30 on the second compartment 27 of the housing 21 and an exit 14 on<br>
the outlet duct 15. The ball return pipe 17 is used to connect the separator 12 to the housing<br>
21 for transferring the cleaning balls 20 from the outlet pipe 9 to the housing 21. The ball<br>
return pipe 17 has an entrance 13 on the separator 12 and an exit 31 on the first compartment<br>
19 of the housing 21. The entrance open mouth 13 of the ball return pipe 17 is formed in the<br>
direction against the fluid flow W3 of the outlet pipe 9 such that the pressure at the entrance<br>
13 of the ball return pipe 17 is higher than that at the exit 14 of the fluid return pipe 16. The<br>
ball return pipe 17 may include a hand valve HV2 which is always open except when<br>
replacing or adding the cleaning balls 20.<br>
The recirculating means also comprises a ball supply pipe 24 and a fluid supply pipe 23. The<br>
ball supply pipe 24 is used to connect the housing 21 to the inlet pipe 5 for supplying the<br>
cleaning balls 20 back to the inlet pipe 5 from the housing 21.<br>
The ball supply pipe 24 has an entrance 26 on the first compartment 19 of the housing 21 and<br>
an exit 3 on the inlet pipe 5. The ball supply pipe 24 may include a hand valve HV1 which is<br>
always open except when changing the cleaning balls 20. The fluid supply pipe 23 is used to<br>
connect the inlet pipe 5 to the housing 21 for supplying the fluid from the inlet pipe 5 to the<br><br>
housing 21. The fluid supply pipe 23 has an entrance 2 on the inlet pipe 5 and an exit 22 on<br>
the first compartment 19 of the housing 21. The entrance 2 of the fluid supply pipe 23 is<br>
formed in the direction against the fluid flow Wl of the inlet pipe 5 such that the pressure at<br>
the entrance 2 of the fluid supply pipe 23 is higher than that at the exit 3 of the ball supply<br>
pipe 24.<br>
The means for supply of cleaning balls and means for return of cleaning balls comprises two<br>
VALVES VI and V2 disposed along the fluid supply pipe 23 and the fluid return pipe 16 to<br>
control the flow of the cleaning balls 20 from the downstream side of the condenser tubing 8<br>
to the upstream side of the condenser tubing 8 via the housing 21. The means to supply<br>
cleaning balls 20 is operative by the opening of the first VALVE VI and keeping the second<br>
valve V2 closed so that the cleaning balls 20 are sucked from the housing 21 to the inlet pipe<br>
5. The means to return cleaning balls 20 is operative by the opening of the second valve V2<br>
and keeping the first valve VI closed, so that the cleaning balls 20 are sucked from the<br>
separator 12 back to the housing 21.<br>
The housing 21 also comprises two check valves or one-way valves, CV1 and CV2 disposed<br>
along the ball supply pipe 24 and the ball return pipe 17.<br>
The first check valve CV1 only permits the fluid and the cleaning balls 20 flow in the<br>
direction from the housing 21 to the inlet pipe 5, and not vice versa. The second check valve<br>
CV2 only permits the fluid and the cleaning balls 20 flow in the direction from the separator<br>
12 to the housing 21, and not vice versa.<br>
The cleaning system may further comprise rotation means arranged at the inlet pipe 5 and<br>
outlet pipe 9 and in this embodiment propellers are used.<br>
A first propeller 4 is placed at the inlet pipe 5 and before the tubing 8 to rotate the cleaning<br>
balls 20 so that the cleaning balls 20 enter the tubing 8 in a random pattern, as indicated by<br>
reference numeral 6. The rotation means are to ensure the cleaning balls 20 are randomly<br>
distributed by centrifugal force as they enter the condenser 7. A second propeller 10 is placed<br>
at the outlet pipe 9 and before the separator 12 so that the fluid and the cleaning balls 20 are<br><br>
rotated to let the cleaning balls 20 collide with each other at the mouth 11 of the separator 12.<br>
This is to increase the number of collisions amongst the cleaning balls 20 so as to remove the<br>
dirt accumulated on the surfaces of the cleaning balls 20 after their passage through the tubing<br>
8.<br>
Having described the various components of the cleaning system, an operation of the cleaning<br>
system will now be described with reference to Figures 1,2, 3 and 4.<br>
We assume an initial position, which is illustrated in Figure 1, whereby the valves VI and V2<br>
are closed and the cleaning balls 20 are accumulated within the first compartment 19 of the<br>
housing 21. There is no flowing of fluid in the ball supply pipe 24 and the ball return pipe 17<br>
because of the pressure at the exit 3 of the ball supply pipe 24 is higher than that at the<br>
entrance 13 of the ball return pipe 17 and the function of the two check VALVES CVI and<br>
CV2.<br>
When the condenser 7 is operating, the cooling fluid is going through the inlet pipe 5.<br>
According to a principle of fluid mechanics, the static pressure at the entrance 2 of the fluid<br>
supply pipe 23 would be higher than that at the exit 3 of the ball supply pipe 24 because of the<br>
entrance 2 of the fluid supply pipe 23 is formed in the direction against the fluid flow Wl of<br>
the inlet pipe 5.<br>
This difference in pressure creates a suction force to draw or suck the fluid from the inlet pipe<br>
5 into the housing 21 via the fluid supply pipe 23 and to draw or suck the fluid and the<br>
cleaning balls 20 from the housing 21 into the inlet pipe 5 via the ball return pipe 24.<br>
To allow the cleaning balls 20 to be drawn out from the housing 21 to the inlet pipe 5, the first<br>
valve VI is opened with the second valve V2 is closed, so that the fluid drawn from the inlet<br>
pipe 5 to the housing 21 and the cleaning balls 20 are then sucked out from the housing 21<br>
and into the inlet pipe 5 for circulating to the tubing 8 to clean the internal walls of the tubing<br>
8. This is the condition illustrated in Figure 2. The direction of the fluid flow from the fluid<br>
supply pipe 23 into the housing 21 and the flow of cleaning balls 20 from the housing 21<br>
through the one way check valve CVI is shown in Figure 2 by the bold arrows.<br><br>
The means for supply of cleaning balls 20 arising from the transfer of cleaning balls 20 is<br>
operative by opening the first valve VI and keeping the second valve V2 closed. In this<br>
manner, cleaning balls 20 from the housing 21 are drawn or sucked from the housing 21 to the<br>
upstream side of the tubing 8, based on the difference in pressure of the entrance 2 of the fluid<br>
supply pipe 23 and the exit 3 of the ball supply pipe 24.<br>
After all the cleaning balls 20 are drawn into the inlet pipe 5, VALVE VI is then closed and<br>
V2 remained closed. The supply of cleaning balls 20 is stopped when the first VALVE VI is<br>
closed, as illustrated in Figure 3.<br>
The first propeller 4, at the time when the first valve VI is opened, is also activated to force<br>
the fluid flow W2 and also the cleaning balls 20 to rotate and as a result the cleaning balls 20<br>
enter the tubing 8 randomly.<br>
After the cleaning process, the second propeller 10 again rotates the cleaning balls 20 so that<br>
the cleaning balls 20 collide with each other and the dirt particles, which were removed by the<br>
cleaning balls 20 from tubing 8 and are now attached to the cleaning balls 20, are"rubbed"off.<br>
The dirt particles would then be carried by the fluid flow W3 for discharge though the outlet<br>
duct 15. It should be noted that the direction of rotation of the second propeller 10 and thus<br>
the cleaning balls 20 is preferably in the opposite direction when compared to the inclined<br>
slots 32 of the separator 12. For example, if the length direction of the inclined slots 32 is<br>
anti-clockwise, then the rotation of the cleaning balls 20 by the propeller 10 should,<br>
preferably, be clockwise. This would increase the collision of the cleaning balls 20 with each<br>
other.<br>
After the rotation, the cleaning balls 20 accumulate at the mouth 11 of the separator 12, as<br>
illustrated in Figure 3.<br>
According to a principle of fluid mechanics, the static pressure at the entrance 13 of the ball<br>
return pipe 17 would be higher than that at the exit 14 of the fluid return pipe 16 because of<br><br>
the entrance 13 of the ball return pipe 17 is formed in the direction against the fluid flow W3<br>
of the outlet pipe 9.<br>
This difference in pressure creates a suction force to draw or suck the fluid (and the cleaning<br>
balls 20) from the separator 12 and into the housing 21 via the ball return pipe 17 and to draw<br>
or suck the fluid (not the cleaning balls 20, because of the apertured partition 28 of the<br>
housing 21) from the housing 21 to the outlet duct 15 via the fluid return pipe 16.<br>
The means for return of cleaning balls 20 from the separator 12 back to the housing 21 is<br>
operative by the opening of the second valve V2 and keeping the first VALVE VI CLOSED,<br>
so that the cleaning balls 20 are sucked from the separator 12 to the housing 21 and the fluid<br>
(not the cleaning balls 20, because of the apertured partition 28 of the housing 21) drawn from<br>
the housing 21 to the outlet duct 15. This is the condition illustrated in Figure 4.<br>
The direction of flow of fluid and cleaning balls 20 from the ball return pipe 17 into the<br>
housing 21 and flow of fluid from the first compartment 17 into the second compartment 27<br>
and then into the fluid return pipe 16 is shown by the bold arrows.<br>
Finally, when all the cleaning balls 20 have arrived back at the first compartment 19 of the<br>
housing 21 and are accumulated there, both valves VI and V2 are then closed, as illustrated in<br>
Figure 1. The operation for return of cleaning balls 20 is stopped when the second valve V2 is<br>
closed.<br>
It can be seen that the means for return of cleaning balls 20 into the housing 21 is operative by<br>
opening the second valve V2 and keeping the first valve VI closed. The means for supply of<br>
cleaning balls 20 from the housing 21 into the cleaning system is operative by opening the<br>
first valve VI and keeping the second valve V2 closed. In both operations, the cleaning balls<br>
20 are circulated through the recirculating means by operation of the means for supply of<br>
cleaning balls and operation of the means for return of cleaning balls. In both operations, it is<br>
the opening and closing of two valves VI and V2 and vice versa which creates the differences<br>
in pressure between the entrance 13 of the ball return pipe 17 and the exit 14 of the fluid<br>
return pipe 16 and differences in pressure between the entrance 2 of the fluid supply pipe 23<br><br>
and the exit 3 of the ball supply pipe 24. The operation of the whole cleaning system can<br>
therefore be easily controlled via the two valves VI and V2, which can be manually operated<br>
or mechanically operated.<br>
When a need arises, when the cleaning balls 20 need to be replaced, the hand valves HVI and<br>
HV2 are closed and the cover 18 is opened, so that the cleaning balls 20 can be replaced.<br>
While the invention has been described with respect to one preferred embodiment, it will be<br>
appreciated that this is set forth merely for purposes of example, and that many variations,<br>
modifications and applications of the invention may be made therein by one skilled in the art<br>
without departing from the scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims.<br>
ADVANTAGEOUS EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
From the described embodiment, it can be observed that the operation of the whole cleaning<br>
system can easily be controlled via the two valves VI and V2, which can be manually<br>
operated or means provided to operate them automatically. Furthermore, the whole cleaning<br>
system have limited moving parts and is therefore more reliable and requires less<br>
maintenance.<br>
In addition, the cleaning system does not waste the cooling fluid which can easily be<br>
recirculated together with the cleaning balls 20.<br><br>
