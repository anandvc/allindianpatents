FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to detecting<br>
ground fault currents and other differential currents and more<br>
particularly to detecting differential current in a direct current (DC)<br>
circuit.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Electrical codes typically require that ground fault<br>
circuit Interrupters (GFCIs) be installed in a plurality of locations. In<br>
homes, for example, GFCIs may be required to be installed in kitchens,<br>
bathrooms and garages. Many ground fault protectors are available<br>
commercially for use in 120VAC and/or 240VAC circuits. A typical<br>
home GFCI uses a differential current transformer that can detect a<br>
differential current as low as 5 milli-amperes on a pair of wires carrying<br>
15 amperes of AC current. A detected difference between source and<br>
return currents typically indicates the presence of a ground fault.<br>
Building codes frequently specify, for example, that a 120VAC circuit is<br>
to be opened in response to a detected ground fault current greater<br>
than 5 milli-amperes.<br>
 Although differential current detection devices<br>
generally are inexpensive and effective when used in AC circuits, they<br>
are not designed to detect faults in direct current (DC) circuits.<br>
Although electric circuit breakers are available with a DC ground fault<br>
trip capability, they are expensive and not sufficiently sensitive to<br>
detect the relatively low levels of fault current typically specified as<br>
ground fault trip thresholds when people are to be preferred.<br><br>
 One growing area of use for DC circuits is in supplying<br>
power for electric vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles. Automotive<br>
power sources can provide high voltages, e.g., between 400 and 800<br>
volts DC, and it is desirable to provide ground fault detection in these<br>
systems. As previously discussed, however, the differential current<br>
detection devices which are currently available are expensive and<br>
inadequate for detecting differential current in DC circuits.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
 The present invention, in one embodiment, is directed<br>
to a detection circuit that detects a difference between a source current<br>
and a return current. The detection circuit includes a constantly biased<br>
magnetic core through which conductors of the source and return<br>
currents extend. The detection circuit also includes a sense winding<br>
around the core. The sense winding carries an AC signal. A sensing<br>
circuit connected with the sense winding senses a change in small<br>
signal impedance of the sense winding relative to the core.<br>
 In another embodiment, a detection circuit that detects<br>
a difference between a source current and a return current includes a<br>
pair of magnetic cores through which conductors of the source and<br>
return currents extend. A bias winding and a sense winding are around<br>
each core. The bias windings carry opposed DC signals. The sense<br>
windings carry an AC signal. A sensing circuit driven by the AC signal<br>
senses a shift in at least one operating point set by at least one of the<br>
DC signals relative to at least one of the cores.<br>
 A detection circuit in another embodiment detects a<br>
difference between a source current and a return current. The<br>
detection circuit has a magnetic core through which conductors of the<br>
source and return currents extend. A bias winding and a sense winding<br>
are around the core, the bias winding carrying a DC signal, the sense<br><br>
winding providing a small signal impedance to the core. A sensing<br>
circuit senses a change in the small signal impedance.<br>
 An embodiment of method of detecting a difference<br>
between a source current and a return current includes conducting the<br>
source and return currents through a pair of opposedly biased<br>
magnetic cores. The method further includes generating a small signal<br>
impedance in a sense winding around one of the cores, and sensing a<br>
change in the small signal impedance.<br>
 In yet another embodiment, a vehicle includes a<br>
detection circuit that detects a difference between a source current and<br>
a return current in an electrical circuit of the vehicle. The detection<br>
circuit includes a magnetic core through which conductors of the<br>
source and return currents extend, and a bias winding and a sense<br>
winding around the core. The bias winding is biased by a DC signal.<br>
The sense winding carries an AC signal. A sensing circuit connected<br>
with the sense winding senses a shift in an operating point set by the<br>
DC signal relative to the core.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS The following description of exemplary embodiments<br>
is merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the<br>
invention, its application, or uses.<br>
 An embodiment of a detection circuit for detecting a<br>
difference between a source current and a return current is indicated<br>
generally by reference number 10 in FIG. 1. The detection circuit 10 is<br>
included, for example, in a power circuit 12 of an electric or hybrid<br>
vehicle 16. It is contemplated, however, that embodiments of the<br>
present invention could be used in other applications.<br>
 The detection circuit 10 includes two magnetic, e.g.,<br>
ferrite, cores 14. Two conductors 18 in the power circuit 12 extend<br>
through the cores 14. The conductors 18 respectively conduct source<br><br>
and return currents between a power source, e.g., a battery, and an<br>
electrical load of the vehicle 16. The source and return currents may<br>
be high-voltage DC currents, for example, between 400 and 800 volts.<br>
Embodiments also could be used, however, in connection with higher<br>
and/or lower voltages.<br>
 Each core 14 is biased in opposite directions with DC<br>
current, as further described below. Each core 14 also has a sense<br>
winding 22 connected to an AC source 26. A sensing circuit 30<br>
includes capacitors 34 respectively connected in series with the sense<br>
windings 22. The capacitors 34 are driven by the Ac source 26 as<br>
further described below. It should be noted that the sensing circuit 30<br>
may be embodied in various ways such that a shift in an operating<br>
point of a core 14 can be sensed as further described below.<br>
 The circuit 10 is shown in greater detail in FIG. 2.<br>
Adjustable DC current sources 38 are controlled by a controller 42 and<br>
are connected to bias windings 46 on each core 14. The controller 42<br>
issues one or more digital signal(s) which are converted to analog and<br>
input to the current sources 38, to produce DC bias fields, typically<br>
expressed in units of amp-turns per meter. Each core 14 is biased with<br>
DC current via the current sources 38, preferably such that an H-field<br>
for the core is brought to a level of moderate saturation as further<br>
described below. The cores 14 are constantly and opposedly biased<br>
so that the H-fields are in opposite directions. In another embodiment,<br>
the cores 14 may include permanent magnet components which are<br>
permanently biased to provide opposing H-fields.<br>
 The series combination sense windings 22 and<br>
capacitors 34 receive a sinusoidal voltage of, e.g., approximately 20<br>
volts peak-to-peak at a frequency fosc between approximately 10 and<br>
20 kilohertz, e.g., about 14 kilohertz. Other voltages and/or<br>
frequencies, however, could be used. The signal from the voltage<br><br>
source 26 does not have to be sinusoidal but could be another time<br>
varying signal.<br>
 Voltage signals Vc1 and VC2 across the capacitors 34<br>
are processed to produce an analog signal 50 that represents<br>
differential current through the conductors 18. In one embodiment,<br>
analog processing of the voltage signals VC1 and VC2 includes using<br>
differential amplification 54, band-pass filtering 58 to pass a band<br>
centered about the frequency fosc of the signal from the AC source 26,<br>
and AC-to-RMS conversion 62. AC-to-RMS conversion converts AC<br>
with the oscillator frequency to a DC (or slowly varying) signal<br>
proportional to the RMS of the differential signal. The controller 42<br>
converts the signal 50 to a digital signal which is used as described<br>
further below. The magnitudes of voltages VC1 and Vc2 also are input<br>
as analog signals to the controller 42, which converts them to digital<br>
signals. The magnitudes of voltages Vc1 and Vc2 may be used by the<br>
controller 42, for example, in calibrating the circuit 10. Generally, it<br>
should be understood that the signal processing components indicated<br>
in FIG. 2 are exemplary only, and that many different analog and/or<br>
digital signal processing components and/or combinations thereof<br>
could be used in various embodiments.<br>
 The controller 42 uses the differential signal 50 to<br>
determine the presence of a differential current through the conductors<br>
18. The controller 42 may monitor the voltage signals Vc1 and Vc2 in<br>
accordance with a method indicated in FIG. 3 by reference number 70.<br>
Referring to FIGs. 2 and 3, the controller at step 80 initializes the circuit<br>
10, for example, by calibrating offsets for the cores 14 and the voltage<br>
signals VC1 and VC2 by adjusting the DC bias currents from the current<br>
sources 38. If at step 86 the controller 42 detects a differential current<br>
signal 50 having a magnitude exceeding a predetermined threshold<br>
value, at step 88 the controller 42 issues a signal 66 to a shutdown<br>
circuit (not shown) that opens the vehicle power circuit 12. The<br><br>
shutdown circuit also may perform various steps preparatory to<br>
opening the circuit 12. If at step 86 no differential current is detected,<br>
control returns to step 86.<br>
 An exemplary hysteresis loop for a core 14 is<br>
indicated generally in FIG. 4 by reference number 100. A DC bias level<br>
is selected so that the B-H loop 100 preferably is bending but not<br>
deeply into saturation at an operating point 104 set by the DC bias<br>
current. The small signal impedance (also known as dynamic or AC<br>
impedance) of the core sense winding 22 varies with the slope of the<br>
B-H loop 100, for example, at the operating point 104.<br>
 If the bias point is shifted further into saturation, for<br>
example, from point 104 to a point 108, the operating point 108 has a<br>
more horizontal slope than that of the operating point 104 as shown in<br>
FIG. 4, and the small signal impedance (inductance) of the core sense<br>
winding 22 is reduced. If the bias point is shifted away from saturation,<br>
for example, from point 104 to a point 112, the small signal impedance<br>
(inductance) of the core sense winding 22 is increased as the operating<br>
point 112 has a more vertical slope than that of the operating point 104.<br>
It can be appreciated that although the operating point 104 is selected<br>
on the curve 100 preferably so as to maximize change in small signal<br>
impedance resulting from an operating point shift, selections of one or<br>
more alternative operating points also are possible.<br>
 When the detection circuit 10 is in use, voltage<br>
develops across each capacitor 34 based on the impedances of the<br>
given capacitor 34 and associated sense winding 22. Preferably, in the<br>
absence of differential current through the conductors 18 (as is the<br>
case, for example, when no ground fault current is present), the same<br>
voltage waveform appears across each capacitor 34. Where, for<br>
example, circuit element variations result in an initial differential voltage<br>
across the two capacitors 34, such voltage can be nullified and/or<br>
filtered so as to reduce noise in the circuit 10.<br><br>
 If there is a differential current through the conductors<br>
18, for example, in the event of a ground fault, such differential current<br>
generates an additional H-field component for each of the cores 14.<br>
The additional H-field components increase the bias field in one core<br>
14 and decrease the bias field in the other core 14. Such bias field<br>
changes cause capacitor voltages to decrease across one capacitor 34<br>
and increase across the other capacitor 34. A difference in the<br>
capacitor voltages is substantially proportional to the ground fault<br>
current.<br>
 Exemplary shifts in operating point are shown in FIG.<br>
5, wherein a graph of capacitor 34 voltage relative to core H field is<br>
indicated as reference number 200. A curve 204 represents voltage of<br>
the capacitor(s) 34 relative to H fields in the cores 14. A solid arrow<br>
208 represents preferably identical operating points in both cores 14 in<br>
the absence of a difference in currents through the conductors 18.<br>
Dotted arrows 212 and 216 represent operating points for the cores 14<br>
which have been shifted respectively left and right due to flux from a<br>
difference in currents through the conductors 18.<br>
 Small signal impedance of a sense winding 22 is<br>
affected, for example, by the number of turns in such sense winding<br>
22, the area of the core 14 associated with such sense winding 22,<br>
core 14 material(s), and operating frequency of the sense circuit 30.<br>
Such parameters preferably are the same for both cores 14. The<br>
impedance of the sense winding is affected by flux levels. The cores<br>
14 are preferably identical. An exemplary core 14 may have a mean<br>
path length of 12.7 centimeters and may be about 2 inches on<br>
diameter. A core 14 may be, for example, a Magnetics OP44925 toroid<br>
core, available from Magnetics, a division of Spang &amp; Company, Butler,<br>
Pennsylvania. An exemplary DC bias winding 46 has about ten (10)<br>
turns and conducts a bias current of about 1.0 ampere. A bias level<br>
may be, for example, about 80 amperes per meter. An exemplary<br><br>
sense winding 22 has about fifty (50) turns. The signal source 26<br>
delivers a signal that is, for example, about 14 kilohertz and about 20<br>
volts peak-to-peak. Exemplary sense capacitors 34 may have<br>
capacitances of about 0.1 microfarads.<br>
 By sensing a voltage difference between the<br>
capacitors 34, the detection circuit 10 obtains a measurement that is<br>
substantially linear relative to DC ground fault current, as shown in FIG.<br>
6. By measuring only the magnitude of the difference in the capacitor<br>
voltages, only the magnitude of the ground fault current is sensed. If<br>
the phase is also measured, the polarity of the fault current can also be<br>
determined. The circuit 10 also can measure AC ground fault current<br>
for frequencies that are much less than the frequency fosc of the sense<br>
signal. Where the frequency fosc is 14 kilohertz, for example, the<br>
ground fault detection circuit 10 can be used to monitor complex<br>
ground fault currents having both AC (e.g., 60Hz) and DC components.<br>
 In one embodiment, an initial difference voltage signal<br>
between the capacitors can be calibrated to zero, for example, by<br>
adjusting a bias current in one or both cores 14, by nulling out any<br>
offset due to volume, material and/or other differences between the<br>
cores 14, and/or by calibrating the voltages of the capacitors 34 to<br>
zero. The microcontroller 42 may be used to perform such calibration.<br>
Noise immunity may also be enhanced, for example, by using a<br>
bandpass filter in sensing the differential voltage between the<br>
capacitors 34.<br>
 A low-cost ground fault circuit interrupter can be<br>
provided using the foregoing differential current detection circuits and<br>
methods. Such a circuit interrupter can be used in connection with<br>
high-voltage DC systems, yet can measure fault current at low levels.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention are also useful for detecting a<br>
combination of AC and DC ground fault currents. Such currents may<br>
result, for example, if a ground fault occurs when auxiliary AC power is<br><br>
electronically generated on an electric vehicle or when a vehicle is<br>
connected to a utility for charging.<br>
 The foregoing electrical circuit and related methods<br>
provide differential current detection in a DC circuit and are particularly<br>
well suited for detecting DC ground fault currents. A detection circuit<br>
embodied in accordance with the principles described herein is simple<br>
and inexpensive compared to prior art DC differential current detection<br>
circuits. Additionally, the foregoing detection circuit can be used to<br>
detect ground faults at levels low enough to protect a person while<br>
maintaining galvanic isolation from high-voltage circuits. Fault currents<br>
can be detected while normal operating currents, for example, for<br>
electric and hybrid vehicles, can pass through the detection circuit.<br>
 Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the<br>
foregoing description that the broad teachings of the present invention<br>
can be implemented in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this<br>
invention has been described in connection with particular examples<br>
thereof, the true scope of the invention should not be so limited since<br>
other modifications will become apparent to the skilled practitioner<br>
upon a study of the drawings, specification, and the following claims.<br><br>
