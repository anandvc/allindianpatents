polymerization. Also the storage stability of higher aluminoxanes is much better. The structure of the higher aluminoxanes will not change during storage, which is the case with MAO.<br>
The higher alkyl aluminoxane used according to the invention preferably contains C2-10 alkyl groups, especially branched alkyl groups, e.g. ethyl, n-propyl, i-propyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, i-butyl, n-pentyl, iso-arayl, sec-amyl, tert-amyl, iso-hexyl, sec-hexyl, or tcrt-hexyl groups. Particularly preferably the higher alkyl aluminoxane contains C3-6 allcyl groups, especially branched aJkyl groups.<br>
The metallocene used accordmg to the invention preferably includes a catalytically active transition metal or lanthanide complexed by one or more, e.g. 1 or 2 homo-or heterocyclic cyclopentadienyl ligands. Where the metallocene contains more than one cyclopentadienyl ligand moiety, then a noniing-substituted cyclopentadienyl ligand moiety may be present. However it is preferred that all the cyclopentadienyl ligand moieties be ring-substituted.<br>
Ring substitution may be for example by pendant gi-oups (e.g. hydrocarbyl or hydrocarbyloxy groups optionally attached via heteroatoms such as O, N, S, P, Si or Ge or via multiply bonded carbon atoms), by fused rings (e.g. such as to produce fused bicyclic or polycyclic structures with 5- and 6 membered homo- or heterocyclic rings, which (other than one five membered ring) may be saturated or unsatui-atcd, e.g. indenyl, tetrahydroindenyl, fluorenyl and octahydi'ofluorenyl groups), by bridging groups attached to the metal or to a second optionally ring-substituted homo- or heterocyclic cyclopentadienyl ring (for example with the linkei moiety providing at least one backbone atom selected from carbon, silicon, oxygen, sulphur, nitrogen and phosphorus, e.g. being an alkylcne or silylene bridge), or by combinations of such substituents, for example witli bridging or pendant gi'oups being attached to rings fused to tlic cyclopentadienyl ligand moiety rather tlian directly to the oyclopentadienyl ring.<br>
The ring substituent(s) on the cyclopentadienyl ring are preferably such as to permit an extension to the n-electron system of the cyclopentadienyl ring, especially preferably such as to further disperse the negative charge on the ring; thus the ring is especially preferably substituted by n-electron withdrawing groups, e.g. polyatomic groups attached via heteroatoms such as 0, S, N or P or via multiple bonded carbons.<br><br>
The catalyst composition of the invention may comprise the mctallocenc and the higher alkyl aluminoxanc cither unreactcd or more preferably as their reaction product. The metalloccne, aluminoxane or metallocene:aluminoxane reaction product may if desired be on a particulate support, e.g. a porous inorganic or inorganic material (e.g. silica) or alternatively they may be in solution in an organic solvent. If desired, one of the metallocene and tlie aluminoxane may be on a particulate support with the other present as a solid, as a liquid or in solution. If desired the metallocene and aluminoxane may be brouglit into contact only in the olefm polymerization reactor or while being dosed into the reactor.<br>
Viewed from a further aspect the invention provides the use of an aluminoxane containing alkyl groups containing at least two carbon atoms as a co-catalyst with a metallocene pro-catalyst containing a ring-substituted homo- or heterocyclic cyclopentadienyl .sandwich ligand for the polymerization of an olefm.<br>
Viewed from anodicr aspect the invention provides the use of a metalloccne containing a ring-substituted homo- or heterocyclic cyclopentadienyl sandwich ligand as a pro-catalyst vvith an aluminoxane co-catalyst contauiLig at Icasil two carbon atoms for tlie polymerization of an olefm.<br>
Viewed from a still further aspect the invention provides the use as a catalyst for olefin polymerization of the reaction product of an aluminoxane containing alkyl groups containing at least two carbon atoms and a metallocene containing a ring-substituted homo- or heterocyclic cyclopentadienyl sandwich ligand.<br>
Viewed from a yet still further aspect the invention provides a process for the preparation of an olefin polymerization catalyst, said process comprising contacting a metallocene pro-catalyst containing a ring-substituted homo- or heterocyclic cyclopentadienyl sandwich ligand witli an aluminoxane containing alkyl groups containing at least two carbon atoms, preferably in an organic solvent or solvent mixture in which said metalloccne and almninoxane are soluble and optionally in the presence of a porous particulate support, and if desired recovering the reaction product of said metallocene and almninoxane, preferably supported on said particulate support.<br>
Viewed from a yet still further aspect the invention provides a method of olefm polymerization comprising contacting an olefm with a metalloceneialuminoxane catalyst composition, characterized in that as said catalyst composition is used a<br><br>
metallocene pro-catalyst containing a ring-substituted homo- or heterocyclic cyclopentadienyl sandwich ligand ajid an aJimiinoxane co-catalyst containing alk&gt;'l groups containing at least two carbon atoms or the reaction product thereof.<br>
Thus using the present invention one may replace MAO as the olefin polymerization co-catalyst in homogenous catalyst compositions. Moreover, using the present invention one may produce a homogenous olefin polymerization catalyst composition suitable for use in gas phase, slurry phase or liquid/solution phase polymerizations.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the process of the invention involves contacting a)     a metallocene of the general formula (I):<br><br>
wherein Cp or each same or different Cp is one of a mono- or polysubstituted, fused or non-fuse3, homo- (" iso-) or heterocyclic cyclopentadienyl ligand, indenyl ligand, tetrahydromdenyl ligand, fluorenyl ligand, or octahydrofluorenyl ligand, Y or each same or different Y is a substituent at tlie cyclopentadienyl ring of said Cp ligand and is one of an -OR, -SR, -NR2, -CiK or R)=, or -PR2 radical, R or each same or different R being one of a substituted or unsubstituted Ci-Cig hydrocarbyl group, a tri-Ci-Cg hydrocarbylsilyl group, a tri-Cj-Cg hydrocarbyloxy silyl group a mixed Ci-Cg hydrocarbyl and Ci-Cg hydrocarbyloxy silyl groups, a tri-Ci-Cg hydrocarbyl germyl group, a tri-Ci-Cg hydrocarbyloxy germyl group or a mixed Ci-Cg hydrocarbyl and Cj-Cg hydrocarbyloxy germyl group; M is a transition metal of Group 4 of the Periodic Table (lUPAC) and bound to the ligand or ligands Cp at least in an ri^ bonding mode; X or each same or different X is bound to M and is one of a hydrogen, a halogen, a substituted or unsubstituted Cj-Cg hydro¬carbyl group, a Ci-Cg hydrocarbylheteroatom (0, S,'N, P) group or a tri-Ci-Cg hydrocarbyl silyl group or two X form together with M a C4-C20 metallocyclic ring structure; Z is a bridge atom or group between two Cp ligands or between one Cp ligand and the transition metal M; q is, when Cp is unbridged, 0-5 for Cp = cyclo¬pentadienyl, 0-3 for Cp = indenyl or tetrahydroindenyl and 0-1 for Cp = fluorenyl or octahydi-ofluorcnyl, or q is, when Cp is bridged, 0-4 for Cp ^ cyclopentadienyl, 0-2 for Cp •- Indenyl or tetrahydroindenyl and 0 for Cp = fluorenyl or octahydro-<br><br><br>
and recovering said homogenous olefin poljmierization catalyst composition.<br>
By mono- or polysubstituted is meant that, in addition to said substituent Y, there may optionally be other substituents at the rings at said ligand or ligands Cp.<br>
By fused or non-fused is meant that any ring at said ligands may be fused or non-fused, i.e. have at least two atoms in common, with at least one further ring.<br>
By homo- and heterocyclic is meant that any ring of said ligands may have only carbon ring atoms (homo- or isocyclic) or may have other ring atoms (e.g. 0, N, S. P) than carbon (heterocyclic).<br>
It has thus been realized that a C2-C10 allcyl aluminoxane (i.e. a non-methyl alurainoxane) can successfully be used as the cocatalyst, if a raetallocene having a -OR', -SR', -NR'2, -C(H or R')», or -PR'2 substiftjent at the cyclopcntadienyl ring is used as the procatalyst.<br><br>
According to a non-limiting explanation, an electron pair of the hetcroatom (0, S, N, P) or double bond substituents at the cyclopentadienyl ring delocalizc it's negative charge and help to ionise the metallocene, whereby the transition metal M becomes more cationic (electron density deficient). This improves the catalytic interaction between the metallocene and the aluminoxane and enables the use of higher aluminoxanes like those of the above formula (2). A commercially acceptable homogenous catalyst composition is the result.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the cyclopentadienyl ring is substituted by an organic oxy radical, i.e. Y in the above formula (1) is an -OR radicaJ. According to another preferred embodiment of the invention, the group R of the radical -OR, -SR, -NR2. -CR = or -PR2 is a tri-C i-Cg hydrocarbyl silyl group.<br>
According to the process of the present invention said support is contacted with a metallocene of the general formula (1). It is preferred that the metallocene of the general formula (1) as group R of said substiment Y has a tri-C j-Cy hydrocarbyl silyl or a tri-C j-Cg hydrocarbyloxy silyl group which ai"e capable of Tt interaction with said 0, S, N, or P atoms of Y. Most preferred are tri-C j-Cg alkyl silyl groups, wherein at least one of the Ci-Cg alkyls is a branched Cs-Cg aBcyl group such as isopropyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, isoamyl, sec-ainyl, tert-amyl, isohexyl, sec-hexyl, or tert-hexyl. Cyclic alkyls and aiyls arc also preferred groups of the silicone atom.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention there is only one ligand Cp in the metallocene of formula (1), which preferably is bound to the transition metal M by both said T)^ bond and by a bridge Z preferably containing a heteroatom such as an N bridge.<br>
However, said metallocene of the general formula (I) has most preferably two ligands Cp, i.e. m is 2. According to a still more preferred embodiment, the tvv'o Cp iigands are bridged with each other by a bivalent atom or group Z having at least one chain atom which is one of a carbon, silicon, oxygen, sulphur, nitrogen, or phosphorous atom. Most preferably, the metallocene of the general formula (1) has m'=2, whereby Z is an ethylene or a silylenc bridge.<br>
The transition metal M of group 4 of tlie Periodic Table in the general formula (1) is Ti, Zr or Hf, more preferably Zr or Hf, and most preferably Zr. The valency or oxidation niunber of M is 4.<br><br>
The preferable atom or group X of said mctalloccne of formula (1) is a halogen atom and/or a Cj-Cg hydrocarbyl group. Most preferably, X is chlorine and/'or methyl. The number of X atoms or groups, i.e. "n",.is preferably 1-3, most preferably 2, considering the limitation given above for the case when Z is a bridge between Cp and M.<br>
Particularly preferred metalloccnes of the general formula (I) are compounds of following structural formula (3).<br><br>

When using chiral metallocenes, they can be used as a racemate for the prepai-ation of highly isotactic a-olefm polymers. The piu-e R or S foiTn of said metallocene can also be used, e.g. for the production of optically active poljotner.<br>
The metallocene of the general formula (1) is usually prepared by a process involving repeated deprotonations/metallizations of the ai-omatic ligands and introduction of the bridge Z atom or atoms as well as tlie central atom by their halogen derivatives. The preparation of the said metallocehe of the general formula (1) can e.g. be carried out according to a J.

Formulas (2) are general formulas including not only linear and cyclic compounds, but also aluminoxane compounds of cage and net structures. See e.g. Harlan, et.al.. J. Am Chem. Soc, 117, (1995) p. 6466, the aluminoxane structures of which are enclosed by reference to disclose one embodiment of the invention.<br>
The aluminoxane used in the process of tlie present invention is preferably an aluminoxane (2), wherein said R' is a C3-C10 ^^^ group, more preferably an isopropyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, isoamyl, sec-amyl, tert-amyl isohexyl, sec-hexyl or tert-hcxyl group. The most prefeiied aluminoxane of the formula (3) is preferably an aluminoxane in which 2 
It is preferable to contact said metallocene of formula (1) or (3) previous to, imme¬diately before, or at the begiiming of the olefm polymerization, with an alumin¬oxane of formula (2) dissolved or immersed in a chlorinated or unchlorinated hydrocarbon solvent such as hexane or toluene. When contacting said metallocene of the formula (I) or (3) with said aluminoxane of tlie fonnula (2), the molar ratio between the aluminoxane aluminium metal and the metallocene transition metal in the catalyst composition is preferably between 20 and 2000, more preferably 50 and<br><br>
1500 and most preferably between 100 and 1200. The concentration of metallocene in tlie catalyst composition is preferably regulated to between 0.01 and 100 mmol/'l, more preferably to between 0.1 and 50 mmol/1, even more preferably to between 0.5 and 10 mmol/l, most preferably to between 1 and 5 mtnol/l.<br>
When preparing a supported olefin polymerization catalyst composition according to the present invention, the contacting product between the metallocene of the general formula (1) or (3) and the aluminoxanc of the general formula (2) can be subjected to a prepolymerization with at least one olefin such as propylene and/or ethylene. The prepolymerizatc is then recovered as said supported olefin poly¬merization catalyst composition. The process may also include a step of solidification (e.g. by precipitation, evaporation, crystallization) of said catalyst, whereby a homogenous solid is obtained.<br>
In addition to the above described process for the preparation of a homogenous olefin polymerization catalyst composition, tlie present invention also relates to a homogenous olefin polymerization catalyst composition which has been prepared according to said described process. The mvention also relates to a process for polymerizing at least one olefin by polymerizing in the presence of said homo¬genous olefin polymerization catalyst or a catalyst prepared according to the above described process. In the polymerization (homopolymerization or copolymerization) olefin monomers, such as ethylene, propylene, 1-butylene, isobutylene, 4-methyl-l-pcntene, 3-methyl-l-butene, 4&gt;4-dimethyl-l-pentene, vinylcyclohexene, 1-dccene and their comonomers, can be used. Dienes and cyclic olefins can also be homo- or copolymerized. These a-olcfins and other monomers can be used both in the poly¬merization and prepolymerization using the claimed supported olefin poly¬merization catalyst composition.<br>
The polymerization can be a homopolymerization or a copolymerization and it can take place in the gas, slurry or a solution phase. The claimed catalyst composition can also be used in high pressure processes. Said a-olefins can be polymerized together with higher a-olefins in order to modify the properties of the final product. Such higher olefms arc 1-hexene, 1-octene, 1-decene, etc.<br>
In the following, the present invention is illustrated by non-limited examples.<br><br>

Some conclusions from the examples of this application<br>
I,  General  behaviour of rac-ethyIene-bis(2-tert-butyldimethylsHoxylndenyl)-zirconiumdlchlorlde/MAO complex<br>
Comparative examples 1, 2, 3 illustrate the genereal behaviour of siloxy substituted cyclopentadienyl compounds when activated by conventional methylaluminoxane with different Al/Zr-ratios.<br>
2.	General behaviour of ethylene-bis(lndenyI)zlrconlumdlchIoride/MAO<br>
complex<br>
Comparative examples 4, 5, 6 illustrate the general polymerization behaviour of non-siloxysubstituted cyclopentadienyl compounds when MAO is used with different Al/Zr-ratios.<br>
3.	Polymerization with sUgthly modified MAO<br>
Comparative example 7 indicates that addition of isobutyl groups into MAO does not affect the activity of siloxy substituted compound. This experiment should be compared to comparative example 1,'where pure MAO was used. No significant change in catalyst performance can be seen.<br>
4.	Polymerization of siloxy substltuated compounds with hexalsobutylalumln-<br>
oxane (= HIBAO)<br>
Examples 1-6 illustrate the general behaviour of new non-MAO based coactivator system with siloxy substituted compounds. AJ/Zr-ratio will clearly affect onto catalyst activity. Example 7 reflects the use of metallocene compounds having methyls at the metal.<br>
5.	Effect of precontact of siloxy substituted metallocene and HIBAO<br>
In example 2 metallocene and HIBAO were fed separately into reactor. In example 3, metallocene and HIBAO were mixed before going into the reactor. No clear difference can be seen in activity. Conclusion: metallocene and coactivator can be fed together or separately into the reactor.<br><br>
6.	Effect of concentration<br>
Examples 5 and 6 indicate that concentration of metallocene compound can be varied quite much without affecting the catalyst activity.<br>
7.	Polymerization of siloxy substituted compounds with tetraisobutylalumin¬<br>
oxane (= TIBAO)<br>
Examples 9, 10, 11, 12 will discribe the use of tetraisobutylaluminoxane as a coactivator with siloxy substituted metallocene compounds.<br>
8.	Polymerization of siloxy substituted compounds with ethylaluminoxane<br>
(* EAO)<br>
Examples 16, 17 discribc the use of ethylaluminoxane as a coactivator with siloxy substituted metallocene compounds.<br>
9.	Comparison of siloxy substituted compounds and corresponding non<br>
substituted compound with HIBAO as a coactivator,<br>
Examples 1, 2, 3 and 5 can be compared directly with comparative examples 8, 9,<br>
10.	According to these examples it is evident that siloxy substitution gives huge<br>
enhancement in catalyst activity with HIBAO. The activity increase is more than 10<br>
fold.<br>
10. Comparison of methylated siloxy substituted compounds and corresponding non methylated compound with HIBAO and TIBAO as a coactivator.<br>
Example 5 and 8 present the affect of methylation of the siloxy substituted compound. The activity increase is 4 times when HIBAO is used as a coactivator. In examples 9 and 13 coactivator is TIBAO and activity is 2 times higher with methylene substituted compound. By methylation is meant that in stead of chlorines, methyls are attached to the metal of the metallocene.<br><br>
11. Position ofslloxy substituent<br>
Examples 5 and 18 describe the affect of position of substituent. By changing the place of substituent from the 2 position to the 3 position the activity increased 2,5 times.<br><br><br>
