thermotropic mesogenic material and with oily conditioning material prior to the incorporation of the conditioning material into the final hair conditioning composition<br>
5  Fatty Materials<br>
Conditioner compositions of the invention preferably additionally comprise fatty materials. The combined use of fatty materials and cationic surfactants in conditioning 10.  compositions is believed to be especially advantageous,<br>
because this leads to the formation of a structured phase, in which the cationic surfactant is dispersed.<br>
By "fatty material" is meant a fatty alcohol, an alkoxylated 15  fatty alcohol, a fatty acid or a mixture thereof.<br>
Preferably, the alkyl chain of the fatty material is fully saturated.<br>
20  Representative fatty materials comprise from 8 to 22 carbon atoms, more preferably 16 to 22.  Examples of suitable fatty alcohols include cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol and mixtures thereof.  The use of these materials is also advantageous in<br><br><br>
that they contribute to the overall conditioning properties of compositions of the invention.<br>
Alkoxylated, (e.g. ethoxylated or propoxylated) fatty 5  alcohols having from about 12 to about 18 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain can be used in place of, or in addition to, the fatty alcohols themselves.  Suitable examples include ethylene glycol cetyl ether, polyoxyethylene (2) stearyl ether, polyoxyethylene (4) cetyl ether, and mixtures 10  thereof.<br>
The level of fatty alcohol material in conditioners of the invention is suitably from 0.01 to 15, preferably from 0.1 to 10, and more preferably from 0.1 to 5 wt%. The weight ratio 15  of cationic surfactant to fatty alcohol is suitably from 10:1 to 1:10, preferably from 4:1 to 1:8, optimally from 1:1 to 1:7, for example 1:3.<br>
OPTIONAL INGREDIENTS 20<br>

5  (ii)   Non-silicone Oily Conditioning Components<br>
Compositions according to the present invention may also comprise a dispersed, non-volatile, water-insoluble oily conditioning agent. 10<br>
By "insoluble" is meant that the material is not soluble in water (distilled or equivalent) at a concentration of 0.1% (w/w), at 25°C.<br>
15  Suitable oily or fatty materials are selected from hydrocarbon oils, fatty esters and mixtures thereof. Straight chain hydrocarbon oils will preferably contain from about 12 to about 30 carbon atoms. Also suitable are polymeric hydrocarbons of alkenyl monomers, such as C2-C6<br>
20  alkenyl monomers.<br><br><br>
Specific examples of suitable hydrocarbon oils include paraffin oil, mineral oil, saturated and unsaturated dodecane, saturated and unsaturated tridecane, saturated and unsaturated tetradecane, saturated and unsaturated 5  pentadecane, saturated and unsaturated hexadecane, and mixtures thereof.  Branched-chain isomers of these compounds, as well as of higher chain length hydrocarbons, can also be used.<br>
10  Suitable fatty esters are characterised by having at least 10 carbon atoms, and include esters with hydrocarbyl chains derived from fatty acids or alcohols, Monocarboxylic acid esters include esters of alcohols and/or acids of the formula R'COOR in which R1 and R independently denote alkyl<br>
15  or alkenyl radicals and the sum of carbon atoms in R1 and R is at least 10, preferably at least 20.  Di- and trialkyl and alkenyl esters of carboxylic acids can also be used.<br>
Particularly preferred fatty esters are mono-, di- and 20  triglycerides, more specifically the mono-, di-, and tri-esters of glycerol and long chain carboxylic acids such as C1-C22 carboxylic acids. Preferred materials include cocoa<br><br><br>
butter, palm stearin, sunflower oil, soyabean oil and coconut oil.<br>
The oily or fatty material is suitably present at a level of 5  from 0.05 to 10, preferably from 0.2 to 5, more preferably from about 0.5 to 3 wt%.<br>
In hair treatment compositions containing a conditioning agent, it is preferred that a cationic polymer also be 10  present.<br>

Examples A-C and 1-7<br>
A base shampoo composition was prepared, comprising 12 wt% sodium lauryl ether sulphate (2EO), 20 wt.% cocoamidopropyl 15  betaine and 8 6 wt. % water.<br>
To this base solution 0.03M of the following compounds was added:<br>
20  Compound A is 2,4-dimethyl-4-heptanol (does not meet the<br>
claimed criteria)<br>
Compound B is 3,7-dimethyl-3-octanol (does not meet the<br>
claimed criteria)<br>
Compound C is 4-raethyl-2-pentanol(does not meet the claimed 25  criteria)<br>
Compound 1 is 2-methyl-2-hexanol, t<br>
Compound 2 is 2-methyl-2-heptanol,<br>
Compound 3 is 2-methyl-3-heptanol,<br>
Compound 4 is 2-methyl-2-pentanol,<br>
30  Compound 5 is 2-methyl-3-hexanol,	<br><br><br>
Compound 6 is 3-methyl-2-pentanol, Compound 7 is 2-methyl-l-pentanol<br>
The compositions were tested in a cuticle abrasion test. 5  Root end hair (as received form the supplier) was pre-cleaned by washing for 1 minute in Composition I followed by copious rinsing in double deionised water. The hair was left to dry naturally over 24 hrs.<br>
10  For each test, 4 g of hair was washed in 0.4 g of the test composition for 30 seconds, rinsed for 30 seconds, and the washing/rinsing cycle repeated. The hair was left to dry naturally overnight.<br>
15  The hair was cut into 1 cm lengths, placed in a blender<br>
bucket and 200 ml of double de-ionised water was added.  The blender was placed on full power for 1 minute.  The liquor was decanted off and transferred to a 50 ml centrifuge tube and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 4,300 RPM. The resulting<br>
20  clear liquor was decanted off leaving the cuticle sediment at the bottom of the tube.<br>
The cuticle was transferred from the tube into a beaker with 3 x 5 ml washes and passed through a series of sieves (425<br>
25  and 53 microns). The sieves were washed with a further 2 x 10 ml of water to ensure complete recovery of the cuticle. The sample was made up to 50 ml in a centrifuge tube, centrifuged for 15 minutes and the liquor decanted off. The cuticle was transferred with double deionised water (2 x<br>
30  10 ml washes) to a beaker and freeze-dried.<br><br><br>
The freeze-dried cuticle was weighed back to determine percentage recovery.<br>
The results were as follows:<br><br>
