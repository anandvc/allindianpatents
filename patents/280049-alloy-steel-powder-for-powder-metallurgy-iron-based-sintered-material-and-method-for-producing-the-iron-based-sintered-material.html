				<td>ALLOY STEEL POWDER FOR POWDER METALLURGY, IRON-BASED<br>
SINTERED MATERIAL, AND METHOD FOR PRODUCING THE IRON-BASED<br>
SINTERED MATERIAL<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to an alloy steel<br>
powder for powder metallurgy suitable for use in powder<br>
metallurgy. In particular, it relates to an alloy steel<br>
powder that improves the strength and toughness of a<br>
sintered material produced by using the alloy steel powder.<br>
The present invention also relates to a sintered material<br>
having excellent strength and toughness produced by using<br>
the alloy steel powder for powder metallurgy and a method<br>
for producing the sintered material.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
[0002] Powder metallurgy can produce parts having complex<br>
shapes very close to product shapes (a.k.a., near-net<br>
shapes) at high dimensional accuracy and thus significantly<br>
reduces the cost for machining. Powder metallurgy products<br>
are thus used in various machines and parts in many fields.<br>
Recently, in order to reduce the size and weight of parts,<br>
improvements on the strength of powder metallurgy products<br>
are demanded. There is particularly strong demand for<br>
increasing the strength of iron-based powder products 'iron-<br>
 <br>
based sintered compacts).<br>
[0003] Green compacts produced from iron-based powders<br>
for powder metallurgy are usually made by mixing an iron-<br>
based powder with an alloying powder such as a copper powder<br>
or a graphite powder and a lubricant such as stearic acid or<br>
lithium stearate to prepare an iron-based powder mixture,<br>
filling a die with the iron-based powder mixture, and<br>
compacting the iron-based powder mixture in the die. Iron<br>
based powders are classified into iron powders (e.g., pure<br>
iron powders), alloy steel powders, etc., in accordance with<br>
the component. Iron-based powders are also classified in<br>
accordance with the production method into atomized iron<br>
powders, reduced iron powders, etc. According to these<br>
classifications, the term "iron powder" is used in a broad<br>
sense and includes alloy steel powders.<br>
[0004] The density of green compacts obtained by a common<br>
powder metallurgy process is usually about 6.6 to 7.1 Mg/m3.<br>
The iron-based powder green compacts are sintered into<br>
sintered compacts and, if needed, sized or machined to<br>
prepare powder metallurgy products. If a higher strength is<br>
needed, the sintered compacts may be subjected to a<br>
carburizing heat treatment or a bright heat treatment.<br>
[0005] Examples of the powder in which alloy elements are<br>
added at the stage of raw material powder include the<br>
following:<br>
 <br>
(1)	a powder mixture containing a pure iron powder and alloy<br>
element powders,<br>
(2)	a prealloyed steel powder in which elements are fully<br>
alloyed, and<br>
(3)	a partially diffused alloy steel powder in which alloy<br>
element powders are partially diffusion-bonded onto surfaces<br>
of a pure iron powder or a prealloyed steel powder.<br>
[0006] The powder mixture (1) containing a pure iron<br>
powder and alloy element powders has an advantage that it<br>
can achieve a high compressibility comparable to that of<br>
pure iron powders. However, during sintering, Mn, Cr, V, Si,<br>
Nb, Ti, and the like which are metals having a higher<br>
activity than Fe undergo oxidation unless the CO2<br>
concentration and the dew point in a sintering atmosphere or<br>
a carburizing atmosphere are stringently controlled to low<br>
levels. Thus, the amount of oxygen is not reduced, the<br>
alloy elements do not sufficiently diffuse into Fe, the<br>
microstructure remains inhomogeneous, and the strengthening<br>
of the matrix cannot be achieved.<br>
[0007] Due to these drawbacks, the powder mixture (1)<br>
containing a pure iron powder and alloy element powders has<br>
not been able to meet the recent demand for high strength<br>
and is thus no longer used.<br>
[0008] In contrast, the prealloyed steel powder (2) in<br>
which elements are fully alloyed and which is produced by<br>
 <br>
atomizing molten steel has an advantage that the amount of<br>
oxygen can be reduced and a high compressibility comparable<br>
to that of pure iron powders can be achieved by limiting the<br>
types and amounts of the alloy elements, such as Mn, Cr, V,<br>
Si, Nb, and Ti, although oxidation still occurs during the<br>
process of atomizing the molten steel and solution hardening<br>
occurs due to full alloying. Moreover, there is a<br>
possibility that the strength of the matrix will be<br>
increased by full alloying and thus this powder has been<br>
developed to serve as a prealloyed steel powder for<br>
achieving high strength.<br>
[0009] The partially diffused alloy steel powder (3) is<br>
made by blending a pure iron powder or a prealloyed steel<br>
powder with metal powders of respective elements and heating<br>
the resulting mixture in a nonoxidative or reducing<br>
atmosphere to cause metal powders to partially diffusion-<br>
bond onto surfaces of the pure iron powder or the prealloyed<br>
steel powder. Thus, the partially diffused alloy powder<br>
combines the advantages of the iron-based powder mixture (1)<br>
and the prealloyed steel powder (2). Since the partially<br>
diffused alloy steel powder (3) reduces the amount of oxygen,<br>
achieves high compressibility comparable to that of a pure<br>
iron powder, and bears a possibility of increasing the<br>
strength of the matrix by developing a multi-phase<br>
microstructure constituted by a fully alloyed phase and a<br>
 <br>
local high-concentration phase, the partially diffused alloy<br>
steel powder is being developed for high strength use.<br>
[0010] Molybdenum is frequently used as a basic alloy<br>
component of the prealloyed steel powders and the partially<br>
diffused alloy steel powders described above. The reason<br>
therefor is the same as the reason for using molybdenum (Mo)<br>
as a reinforcing element of iron and steel materials. That<br>
is, Mo not only suppresses generation of ferrite in iron and<br>
steel materials and forms bainite microstructures to<br>
strengthen the matrix by transformation, but also<br>
distributes itself to the matrix and carbides to achieve<br>
solution hardening of the matrix and precipitation hardening<br>
of the matrix by turning into fine carbides. Moreover,<br>
since Mo has high gas carburizability without grain boundary<br>
oxidizing, Mo also has an effect of carburization hardening.<br>
[0011] Elements, such as V, Nb, and Ti, having a high<br>
carbide-forming capability are also added since they form<br>
carbides that strengthen the sintered materials through<br>
precipitation hardening.<br>
[0012] For example, Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
Application Publication No. 8-49047 (Patent Document 1)<br>
discloses an alloy steel powder for powder metallurgy<br>
containing Mo: 0.1 to 6.0%, V: 0.05 to 2.0%, and Nb: 0.10*;<br>
as a prealloy and Mo: 4% or less which is partially<br>
diffusion-bonded thereto. This alloy steel powder contains<br>
 <br>
a reduced amount of oxygen and offers high compressibility<br>
comparable to that of a pure iron powder at the powder stage,<br>
and achieves a decrease in oxygen content and matrix<br>
strengthening when the powder is processed into sintered<br>
materials or carburized and quenched materials.<br>
[0013] Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication<br>
No. 7-331395 (Patent Document 2) discloses an alloy steel<br>
powder for high-strength sintered compacts, containing, on a<br>
weight basis, Cr: 0.5 to 2%, Mn: 0.08% or less, Mo: 0.1 to<br>
0.6%, and V: 0.05 to 0.5%, at least one of Nb: 0.01 to 0.08-<br>
and Ti: 0.01 to 0.08%, and Mo: 0.05 to 3.5% diffusion-bonded<br>
thereto. According to this technique, an alloy steel powder<br>
controlled to exhibit excellent compressibility and an<br>
adequate hardenability can be obtained. When this alloy<br>
steel powder is used and the cooling rate after sintering is<br>
controlled, a fine pearlite microstructure can be produced<br>
in a sintered compact without generating a coarse upper<br>
bainite microstructure and a high-strength is achieved as<br>
sintered.<br>
[0014] However, the inventors have found that it is<br>
difficult even for sintered materials made from the alloy-<br>
steel powders set forth in Patent Documents 1 and 2 to<br>
achieve both strength and toughness.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
 <br>
[0015] Accordingly, an object of the present invention is<br>
to provide an alloy steel powder for powder metallurgy that<br>
can achieve both strength and toughness, as well as a<br>
sintered material having excellent strength and toughness<br>
produced by using the alloy steel powder and a method for<br>
producing the sintered material.<br>
[0016] The inventors have extensively studied the alloy<br>
components of iron-based powders and means for adding the<br>
alloy components and found the following.<br>
[0017] When an iron-based powder in which a carbide-<br>
forming element such as Nb is prealloyed in an iron powder<br>
and only Mo is diffusion-bonded to the iron powder is mixed<br>
with a carbon powder and the resulting mixture is compacted<br>
and sintered, the concentration of the alloy element, Mo is<br>
high in sintered neck portions between the grains of the<br>
iron-based powder. Accordingly, in the sintered neck<br>
portions, C and carbide-forming elements such as Mo and Nb<br>
are present and carbides containing Mo, Nb, and the like are<br>
precipitated and dispersed.<br>
[0018] Since the sintered neck portions contain a large<br>
number of pores, the strength of the sintered neck portions<br>
tends to be low. However, when carbides are precipitated<br>
around the pores, the sintered neck portions are<br>
strengthened.<br>
[0019] In contrast, since Mo is not contained in the<br>
 <br>
matrix portion, formation of carbides is suppressed in the<br>
matrix portion compared to the sintered neck portions. Thus<br>
the matrix portion forms a microstructure with high<br>
toughness. The present invention has been made on the basis<br>
of these findings.<br>
[0020] A first aspect of the present invention provides<br>
an alloy steel powder for powder metallurgy produced by<br>
diffusion-bonding a molybdenum-containing powder in a<br>
molybdenum-based amount of 0.05% to 1.5% by mass onto<br>
surfaces of a steel powder prealloyed with 0.02% to 0.4% by<br>
mass of niobium.<br>
[0021] A second aspect of the present invention provides<br>
an alloy steel powder for powder metallurgy produced by<br>
diffusion-bonding a molybdenum-containing powder in a<br>
molybdenum-based amount of 0.05% to 1.5% by mass onto<br>
surfaces of a steel powder prealloyed with 0.02% to 0.4 V by<br>
mass of niobium and at least one of 0.01% to 0.4% by mass of<br>
vanadium and 0.01% to 0.4% by mass of titanium.<br>
[0022] A third aspect of the present invention provides<br>
an iron-based sintered material produced by compacting and<br>
sintering the alloy steel powder according to the first or<br>
second aspect, in which a carbide containing at least<br>
niobium and molybdenum is precipitated around a pore of the<br>
sintered material.<br>
[0023] The carbide containing at least niobium and<br>
 <br>
molybdenum may be at least one of (Nb,Mo)C, (Nb,V,Mo)C,<br>
(Nb,Ti,Mo)C, and (Nb,Ti,V,Mo)C.<br>
[0024] A fourth aspect of the present invention provides<br>
a method for producing an iron-based sintered material. The<br>
method includes mixing the alloy steel powder according to<br>
Claim 1 or 2 with 0.1% to 1.0% by mass of a carbon powder to<br>
prepare a mixture; compacting the mixture at a pressure of<br>
400 to 1000 MPa to prepare a green compact; and sintering<br>
the green compact at a temperature of 1100°C to 1300°C to<br>
precipitate a carbide containing at least niobium and<br>
molybdenum around a pore of the resulting sintered material.<br>
[0025] In this method, the carbide containing at least<br>
niobium and molybdenum may be at least one of (Nb,Mo)C,<br>
(Nb,V,Mo)C, (Nb,Ti,Mo)C, and (Nb,Ti,V,Mo)C<br>
[0026] A sintered material having both high strength and<br>
high toughness can be obtained by using an alloy steel<br>
powder for powder metallurgy in which Nb only or Nb and V<br>
and/or Ti are prealloyed and only Mo is diffusion bonded.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0027] Figure is a schematic view showing a sintered<br>
microstructure including sintered neck portions of a<br>
sintered compact obtained by the present invention.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
 <br>
[0028] The present invention will now be described in<br>
detail.<br>
[0029] According to an alloy steel powder for powder<br>
metallurgy of the present invention, a Mo-containing powder<br>
is diffusion-bonded onto surfaces of a steel powder<br>
prealloyed either with Nb only or with Nb and V and/or Ti.<br>
[0030] When the iron-based powder of the present<br>
invention is mixed with a carbon powder and the resulting<br>
mixture is compacted and sintered, the concentration of the<br>
alloy element Mo is high in the sintered neck portions<br>
between the grains of the iron-based powder. Accordingly,<br>
Mo, Nb, V, Ti, and C are present and carbides containing Mo,<br>
Nb, V, Ti, and the like are precipitated and dispersed in<br>
the sintered neck portions.<br>
[0031] Since a large number of pores are present in the<br>
sintered neck portions, the strength of the sintered neck<br>
portions tends to be low. However, when the carbides are<br>
precipitated around the pores, the sintered neck portions<br>
are strengthened.<br>
[0032] In contrast, since Mo is not contained in the<br>
matrix portion, formation of carbides is suppressed in the<br>
matrix portion compared to the sintered neck portions. Thus<br>
the matrix portion forms a microstructure with high<br>
toughness.<br>
[0033] High strength and high toughness are presumably<br>
 <br>
simultaneously achieved by controlling the carbide-formation<br>
regions as described above.<br>
[0034] The reason for pre-alloying Nb, V, and Ti in the<br>
composition ranges described above will now be described.<br>
In the description below, "%" indicates the fraction (mass%)<br>
relative to the entire alloy steel powder for powder<br>
metallurgy (after diffusion-bonding of Mo-containing powder;<br>
of the present invention.<br>
Nb: 0.02 to 0.4%<br>
[0035] Niobium (Nb) has an action of highly effectively-<br>
improving the strength once precipitated as a carbide in the<br>
matrix. However, when the Nb content is less than 0.02%,<br>
the amount of carbide generated is insufficient and the<br>
strength of the sintered compact is not sufficiently<br>
increased. In contrast, when the Nb content exceeds 0.4%,<br>
not only the carbide becomes coarse, the effect of improving<br>
the strength is lowered, and the compressibility is<br>
deteriorated due to hardening of alloy steel powder grains,<br>
but also an economic disadvantage results. The Nb content<br>
is more preferably 0.05% to 0.3%.<br>
At least one of V: 0.01 to 0.4% and Ti: 0.01 to 0.4%<br>
[0036] Vanadium (V) and titanium (Ti) are the next useful<br>
carbide-forming elements to Nb and contributes to further<br>
 <br>
improving the strength when used in combination with Nb.<br>
However, neither of the elements exhibits sufficient<br>
hardening effect below the lower limit and both elements<br>
form coarse carbides at a content exceeding the upper limit,<br>
resulting in a decreased strength improving effect and<br>
deterioration of compressibility. Thus, V and Ti contents<br>
are set in the above-described ranges. More preferably, the<br>
content of each of these elements is 0.3% or less.<br>
[0037] When the total content of Nb, V, and Ti is within<br>
the range of 0.09% to 0.18%, a sintered material having<br>
outstanding strength and toughness can be obtained.<br>
[0038] Next, a method for producing an alloy steel powder<br>
for powder metallurgy according to the present invention is<br>
described.<br>
[0039] First, an iron-based powder (iron-based powder as<br>
a raw material) containing particular amounts of alloy<br>
elements as alloy components (i.e., as a prealloy), and a Mo<br>
raw material powder, which is a raw material of the Mo-<br>
containing powder, are prepared.<br>
[0040] An atomized iron powder is preferred as the iron-<br>
based powder. An atomized iron powder is an iron-based<br>
powder obtained by atomizing molten steel having alloy<br>
components adjusted to suite the purpose with water or gas.<br>
An atomized iron powder is usually heated in a reducing<br>
atmosphere (e.g., hydrogen atmosphere) after atomization to<br>
 <br>
decrease the amounts of C and 0 in the iron powder. However,<br>
an as-atomized iron powder, i.e., an iron powder without<br>
such a heat treatment, may be used as the iron-based powder<br>
as the raw material of the present invention.<br>
[0041] The target Mo-containing powder itself may be used<br>
as the Mo raw material powder or a molybdenum compound that<br>
can be reduced to a Mo-containing powder may be used as the<br>
Mo raw material powder.<br>
[0042] Preferred examples of the Mo-containing powder<br>
include a pure metal powder of Mo, a Mo oxide powder, and a<br>
Mo alloy powder such as a ferro-molybdenum (FeMo) powder.<br>
Examples of the molybdenum compound include a Mo carbide, a<br>
Mo sulfide, and a Mo nitride.<br>
[0043] The iron-based powder and the Mo raw material<br>
powder are mixed with each other at a particular ratio. The<br>
mixing method is not particularly limited. For example, a<br>
Henschel mixer or a conical mixer can be used.<br>
[0044] The resulting mixture is held at a high<br>
temperature and Mo is diffused in iron at contact surfaces<br>
between the iron-based powder and the Mo raw material powder<br>
to conduct bonding. As a result, an alloy steel powder for<br>
powder metallurgy according to the present invention is<br>
obtained.<br>
[0045] The atmosphere for the heat treatment is<br>
preferably a reducing atmosphere or a hydrogen-containing<br>
 <br>
atmosphere and more preferably a hydrogen-containing<br>
atmosphere. The heat treatment may be conducted under<br>
vacuum. The temperature for the heat treatment is<br>
preferably in the range 800°C to 1200°C and more preferably<br>
in the range of 800°C to 1000°C.<br>
[0046] When an as-atomized iron powder is used as the<br>
iron-based powder, the heat treatment is preferably<br>
conducted in a reducing atmosphere to decrease the amounts<br>
of C and 0 contained in large amounts in the iron powder.<br>
Decreasing the C content and the 0 content activates the<br>
iron-based powder surfaces and bonding caused by diffusion<br>
of the Mo-containing powder assuredly occurs even at a low<br>
temperature (about 800°C to 900°C).<br>
[0047] When the diffusion-bonding treatment is conducted<br>
as described above, the iron-based powder and the Mo-<br>
containing powder usually become sintered and consolidated.<br>
Thus, the mixture is pulverized and classified to a desired<br>
particle size and, if needed, annealed to prepare an alloy<br>
steel powder for powder metallurgy.<br>
[0048] In the present invention, fine particles of the<br>
Mo-containing powder are preferably uniformly bonded onto<br>
the iron-based powder surfaces. When the particles are not<br>
uniformly bonded, they tend to detach from the iron-based<br>
powder surfaces during transportation or pulverization of<br>
the alloy steel powder for powder metallurgy after the<br>
 <br>
bonding treatment. Accordingly, the amount of the Mo-<br>
containing powder in a free state increases in particular.<br>
When a green compact formed of an alloy steel powder in that<br>
state is sintered, the carbide diffusion state tends to<br>
become segregated. Accordingly, in order to increase the<br>
strength and toughness of the sintered compact, it is<br>
preferable to have the Mo-containing powder uniformly bonded<br>
onto the surfaces of the iron-based powder to reduce the<br>
amount of Mo-containing powder in a free state generated by<br>
detachment or the like.<br>
[0049] The amount of Mo to be diffusion-bonded is 0.05%<br>
to 1.5% on a Mo basis relative to the entire alloy steel<br>
powder. At a content lower than 0.05%, the carbide-forming<br>
effect is small and the strength-improving effect is<br>
weakened. In contrast, at a content exceeding 1.5%, the<br>
carbide-forming effect is saturated and the microstructure<br>
of the sintered compact becomes inhomogeneous. Thus, the<br>
strength-improving effect is no longer obtained.<br>
Accordingly, the amount of Mo to be diffusion-bonded is set<br>
to 0.05% to 1.5%, preferably 0.05% to 0.5%, more preferably<br>
0.1% to 0.5%, and yet more preferably 0.15% to 0.3%.<br>
[0050] The balance of the alloy steel powder includes<br>
iron and impurities. Impurities contained in the alloy<br>
steel powder are, for example, C, O, N, S, and the like.<br>
They pose no problem as long as the C content is 0.02% or<br>
 <br>
less, the 0 content is 0.3% or less, the N content is 0.004<br>
or less, and the S content is 0.03% or less. In particular,<br>
the 0 content is preferably 0.2% or less.<br>
[0051] In producing a sintered compact by using the alloy<br>
steel powder described above as a raw material, a carbon<br>
powder such as graphite is added in an amount of 0.1% to<br>
1.0% on a C basis and mixed prior to the compaction since<br>
the carbon powder is effective for increasing the strength<br>
and enhancing the fatigue strength. This amount on a C<br>
basis is a mass ratio relative to the alloy steel powder<br>
mixture after the mixing.<br>
[0052] In the present invention, additives for improving<br>
characteristics may, as a matter of course, be added to meet<br>
the purpose. For example, a Cu powder or a Ni powder may be<br>
added to improve the strength of the sintered compact and a<br>
machinability improving powder such as MnS may be added to<br>
improve the machinability of the sintered compact.<br>
[0053] Impurities contained in the alloy steel powder<br>
mixture pose no particular problem as long as the 0 content<br>
is 0.3% or less, the N content is 0.004% or less, and the S<br>
content is 0.03% or less. Preferably, the 0 content is 0.2%<br>
or less. However, when any of these elements is<br>
intentionally added as an additive, such an element is no<br>
longer an impurity and the content thereof does not have to-<br>
be in the range described above.<br>
 <br>
[0054] Next, preferable sintering conditions for<br>
producing a sintered compact by using the alloy steel powder<br>
for powder metallurgy according to the present invention are<br>
described.<br>
[0055] A powder lubricant may be mixed with the alloy<br>
steel powder in conducting the compaction. The lubricant<br>
may be applied or adhered to a die. In any case, a known<br>
lubricant such as a metal soap, e.g., zinc stearate, or an<br>
amide wax, e.g., ethylenebisstearamide, is preferably used<br>
as the lubricant. When a lubricant is mixed, the amount of<br>
the lubricant is preferably about 0.1 to 1.2 parts by mass<br>
relative to 100 parts by mass of the alloy steel powder<br>
mixture.<br>
[0056] Compaction needs to be conducted at a pressure of<br>
400 to 1000 MPa. This is because, at a pressure less than<br>
400 MPa, the density of the resulting compact is decreased<br>
and the characteristics of the sintered compact are degraded.<br>
In contrast, at a pressure exceeding 1000 MPa, the lifetime<br>
of the die is shortened and an economic disadvantage results.<br>
The temperature during the compaction is preferably in the<br>
range of room temperature (about 20°C) to about 160°C.<br>
[0057] Sintering needs to be conducted in a temperature<br>
range of 1100°C to 1300°C. This is because sintering does<br>
not proceed and the characteristics of the sintered compact<br>
are degraded at a sintering temperature less than 1100oC and<br>
 <br>
the lifetime of the sintering furnace is shortened and an<br>
economic disadvantage results at a sintering temperature<br>
exceeding 1300°C. The duration of sintering (sintering<br>
time) is preferably 10 to 180 minutes. The sintering<br>
temperature range and the sintering time are suitable for<br>
precipitating at least carbides of Nb and Mo around the<br>
pores of the sintered material.<br>
[0058] The resulting sintered compact may be subjected to<br>
a strengthening treatment such as carburized quenching,<br>
bright quenching, high-frequency quenching, and<br>
carbonitriding as needed. The sintered compact exhibits<br>
improved strength and toughness without undergoing the<br>
strengthening treatment compared to existing sintered<br>
compacts (not subjected to a strengthening treatment). The<br>
strengthening treatment may be conducted according to a<br>
common method.<br>
[0059] When the sintering is conducted, regions with high<br>
Mo concentrations are formed in the sintered neck portions<br>
between grains of the iron-based powder. Since C is also<br>
present as well as the carbide-forming element such as Nb in<br>
these regions, carbides containing Mo, Nb, and the like are<br>
precipitated and dispersed in these regions. When the<br>
carbides are precipitated around the pores, the sintered<br>
neck portions are strengthened and thus a microstructure<br>
having excellent strength and toughness can be obtained.<br>
 <br>
Figure is a schematic diagram of a sintered microstructure<br>
of a sintered compact obtained by the present invention.<br>
The sintered microstructure includes an iron-based powder 1<br>
and sintered neck portions 2 around pores.<br>
[0060] Examples of the carbides containing Mo, Nb, and<br>
the like include (Nb,Mo)C, (Nb,V,Mo)C, (Nb,Ti,Mo)C, and<br>
(Nb,Ti,V,Mo)C.<br>
[0061] Preferably, about one to one hundred precipitates<br>
of such carbides are present in these Mo-rich regions of the<br>
sintered neck portions in a unit area of 1 µm. The Mo-rich<br>
regions refer to regions about 10 µm around the sintered<br>
neck portions.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
[0062] The present invention will now be described in<br>
further detail by using Examples. These examples do not<br>
limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
[0063] Each of the molten metals containing alloy<br>
elements indicated in Nos. 1 to 17 in Table was atomized by<br>
a water atomization method and formed into an as-atomized<br>
iron-based powder. To the iron-based powder, a Mo oxide<br>
powder was added at a particular ratio. The resulting<br>
mixture was mixed in a V-type mixer for 15 minutes and heat-<br>
treated (holding temperature: 875°C, holding time: 1 h) in a<br>
hydrogen atmosphere with a dew point of 30°C to prepare an<br>
 <br>
alloy steel powder for powder metallurgy constituted by the<br>
iron-based powder having surfaces onto which a particular<br>
amount Mo was diffusion-bonded.<br>
[0064] To the alloy steel powder for powder metallurgy,<br>
graphite in an amount indicated in Table was added. To 100<br>
parts by mass of the resulting alloy steel powder mixture,<br>
0.6 parts by mass of ethylenebisstearamide was added,<br>
followed by mixing in a V-type mixer for 15 minutes. Then<br>
the mixture was compacted at a pressure of 686 MPa to<br>
prepare a tablet-shape green compact having a length of 55<br>
mm, a width of 10 mm, and a thickness of 10 mm.<br>
[0065] The tablet-shape green compact was sintered into a<br>
sintered compact. Sintering was performed in a N2-10% H2<br>
atmosphere at a sintering temperature of 1130°C and a<br>
sintering time of 20 minutes.<br>
[0066] The sintered compact was processed into a round<br>
bar test piece 5 mm in diameter in a parallel portion for<br>
use in a tensile test. The sintered compact having a shape<br>
as sintered was prepared as a test piece for a Charpy impact<br>
test. Each test piece was subjected to gas-carburizing<br>
(holding temperature: 870°C, holding time: 60 minutes) at a<br>
carbon potential of 0.8%, followed by quenching (60°C, oil<br>
quenching) and tempering (180°C, 60 minutes). The tensile<br>
strength TS (MPa) and impact value (J/cm2) of each sintered<br>
compact were measured. The results are shown in Table.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
[0067] The tensile strength and impact value were<br>
compared between Examples and Comparative Examples as shown<br>
in Table. Whereas all of Examples achieved both high-<br>
strength, i.e., a tensile strength of 1150 MPa or more, and<br>
high toughness, i.e., an impact value of 10 J/cm2 or more,<br>
none of Comparative Examples achieved both.<br>
 <br>
[0068] A section was taken from each sintered compact and<br>
observed with a scanning electron microscope and analyzed by<br>
image analysis. In all Examples, about 1 to 100<br>
precipitates of (Nb,Mo)C, (Nb,V,Mo)C, (Nb,Ti,Mo)C,<br>
(Nb,Ti,V,Mo)C, and the like were observed in a unit area of<br>
1 µm2 in the Mo-rich regions of the sintered neck portions.<br>
