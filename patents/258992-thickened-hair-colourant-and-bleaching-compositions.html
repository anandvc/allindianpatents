				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to hair colour and hair bleaching compositions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The permanent alteration of the colour of keratinous fibres, in particular human hair, by the application of hair dyes is well known. In order to provide the consumer with the hair colour and the intensity of colour desired, a very complex chemical process is utilized. Permanent hair dyeing formulations typically comprise oxidative hair dye precursors, which can diffuse into the hair through the cuticle and into the cortex where they can then react with each other and suitable oxidising agents to form the end dye molecules. Due to the larger size of these resultant molecules they are unable to readily diffuse out of the hair during subsequent washing with water and/or detergents; hence delivering a consumer-desired permanency of colour. This reaction typically takes place in an aggressive environment at approximately pH 10 in the presence of an alkalizing agent and in the presence of an oxidizing agent. Moreover, the consumer repeats this process regularly in order to maintain the desired hair colour and shade and the intensity of colour and to ensure continual, even coverage of the hair including coverage of new hair growth.<br>
The manufacturer of such products is also required to work within a large number of constraints. Since these products are being placed in direct contact with the consumers' skin, the potential exists for accidental contact with the eye or for ingestion (for example), which can occur during the dyeing process. Therefore, the formulation must meet rigorous safety requirements and not induce any allergic reactions. In addition to meeting these requirements, the products must also be optically and olfactory pleasing to the consumer. In particular, the products also need to meet certain physical parameters in order to ensure that the product can be easily applied to the hair by the consumer to provide the desired effect, without unintentional staining of the consumers' clothes, skin particularly along the hair line or other objects.<br>
The manufacturer is also required to provide the hair colouring consumer a large range of different resulting colours. Some consumers may just wish to enhance the natural colour of the hair, whilst others may wish to cover grey or completely alter the hair colour to a different natural appearing hair colour or a 'synthetic' appearing hair colour. Consequently, the manufacturer may provide over twenty different formulations, of varying colours and shades, to address the range of consumer specific needs. These formulations have to be individually formulated and are typically complex formulae containing a mixture of different dye compounds. As a result the manufacture of such product ranges can be costly and complex.<br>
However, despite the fact that commercial hair dyeing products have been available for many years, the products still exhibit a number of consumer-related deficiencies.<br>
Typically permanent hair dye products will contain an alkali, typically a source of ammonia. This serves the purpose of swelling the hair allowing the entry of the dye precursor molecules into the hair and also improves the lightening effect of the oxidising agent, which is typically hydrogen peroxide. However, ammonia is also volatile and its associated odour is extremely unpleasant to the consumers' of such products, particularly as these hair dye products are used in close proximity to the nasal region. Hence, it would be highly desirable to provide an oxidative hair colouring and/or bleaching composition, which delivers the consumer required lightening level and colour, but which has reduced or eliminated the detectable ammonia odour.<br>
In fact another deficiency area in current hair colouring products is the provision of hair colouring products which deliver the required hair lightening effect. Delivering the required level of lightening is particularly important in order to provide the full range of colour shades demanded by the consumer, especially for blonde shades and grey coverage. Such products pose particular difficulties to the manufacturer, as they usually require the use of high levels of oxidising agent and ammonia in order to deliver the required lightening effect. However, in additional to the problems associated with the presence of high levels of ammonia in these products, as discussed herein above, the presence of these high levels of ammonia and/or oxidizing agent also affect the condition of the hair and may in some cases induce mild skin irritation on the scalp. In particular, the hydrophilicity of the hair surface is increased during the colouring process, which alters the sensory perception of the hair and its overall manageability<br>
during, immediately after colouring and during the subsequent wash and styling cycles until the next colourant application. Hence, it would also be highly desirable to provide an oxidative hair colouring and/or bleaching composition which delivers the required lightening and/or colour without unnecessary hair damage.<br>
A number of attempts have been described in the literature to address at least some of the above identified improvement areas. For example the use of carbonate has been described in the following hair colouring art.<br>
EP 435 012 describes hair-dyeing compositions, which require a short dyeing time, create little damage to hair, and no irritating odour after dyeing comprising a carbonate source, a non odour generating alkali hydrogen peroxide and a buffer solution. Similarly EP 1 106 166 describes hair dye compositions comprising ammonia, carbonate (other than ammonia salt), transition metal salt and chelating agent which do not give off an irritating odour, have low skin irritation and can change the hair colour into a lighter tone in a short time. WO01/28508 describes hair colouring formulations comprising oxidising agents and ammonia carbonate or carbamate which deliver improved bleaching and colouring with reduced odour and hair damage without the need for buffering agents, pH modifiers or hair swelling agents. JP01206825 describes a low pungent hair colouring composition comprising ammonia, ammonium salt and carbonate. US2004/0083557 describes hair colouring compositions comprising an oxidative hair dye precursor, a metal cyanate, an alkalizing agent and an oxidizing agent and preferably a metal bicarbonate salt in order to provide good colour lift and low odour.<br>
WO04/014328 describes one step hair colouring compositions comprising peroxide oxidizing agents, specific oxidizing agents and at least one water soluble carbonate releasing salts which more effectively deliver colour wherein the composition is applied for a period of from 2 to 60 minutes. US2004/0098814 describes a method of permanently colouring hair whereby the hair is subjected to a number of consecutive short treatments whereby the treatment comprises a dye intermediate in a shampoo or conditioner base, a water soluble carbonate releasing salt and a water soluble ammonium salt. US2004/0098816 also describes a method for the gradual permanent colouring of hair which includes subjecting the hair to a number of treatments having<br>
a set time interval between them, wherein the treatment compositions comprise ammonium carbonate in combination with a chelant.<br>
However it has now been found that the use of hydrogen peroxide and carbonate hair colourant systems, results in difficulties in manufacturing. This problem is particularly manifest for compositions which have high levels of peroxide and carbonate which arc desirable to provide high levels oflift. Moreover in order to provide a product which the consumer can easily apply to the hair without dripping onto the skin, clothes or bathroom surfaces, hair colourant products are designed such that the composition has a certain required viscosity. This is either achieved by providing the dye composition and the oxidizing composition as so called thin-thin type liquid formulations which are thickened upon mixing or where at least one of (he components, either the dye composition or the oxidizing composition, preferably the dye composition, is provided as a thickened formulation which thickens the total composition upon mixing.<br>
Carbonate systems in the art herein above describe numerous materials suitable for thickening. However these materials have been found not to sufficiently thicken compositions comprising high levels of carbonate resulting in product instability or unsatisfactory viscosity. Hence it would be desirable to provide a hair colorant composition which incorporates high levels of carbonate widiout compromising the product stability or ease of manufacture.<br>
Another particularly critical performance area for the consumer is the provision of the desired resultant colour and also the effective coverage of grey hair. Indeed, whilst the amount of grey hair to be coloured varies considerably from consumer to consumer, the resultant overall appearance of the coloured hair demanded by the consumer should be nearly identical for the naturally pigmented hair and the grey hair on head, with the added requirement that the initial uniform and even colour coverage is maintained during the post dyeing washing and drying cycle.<br>
Hence, it would be further desirable to provide the consumer with a hair colourant, providing improved lift and lightening and improved colour delivery, uptake and durability and which is easy to manufacture, delivering the required viscosity and is shelf life stable.<br>
It has now been surprisingly found mat oxidative hair colouring compositions comprising an oxidizing agent, a source of carbonate ions, and a specific gel network thickening system as defined herein below, preferably utilized at a pH 9.5 and below, can be fonuulated as stable thickened systems. Moreover the compositions exhibit low odour and deliver a high level of lift and lightening equal to the currently utilised ammonia/peroxide systems, whilst reducing the concentration of peroxide and reducing the hair fibre damage. Moreover, the compositions of the present invention are compatible with current dyes and dye precursor systems and result in improved lift and lightening for blonde shades, excellent dye deposition and colour and improved grey coverage.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a hair colouring and hair bleaching composition<br>
comprising component parts (i) and (ii) which are mixed prior to application to the hair, component part (i) comprising at least one source of oxidizing agent and<br>
component part (ii) comprising a source of carbonate ions, carbamate ions, or hydrogencarbonate ions and mixture thereof and at least one gel network thickener system defined hereinafter.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention relates to a hair colouring and bleaching kit comprising i) an individually packaged oxidizing component comprising at least one oxidizing agent and ii) an individually packaged second component comprising a source of carbonate ions, carbamate ions, or hydrogencarbonate ions and mixture thereof and at least one gel network thickener system defined hereinafter.<br>
The present invention also relates to a method of treating hair comprising the steps of mixing the component parts i and ii and applying said mixed composition to the hair for from about 2 to 60 minutes and subsequently rinsing said composition from the hair.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
While the specification concludes with claims, which particularly point out and distinctly claim the invention, it is believed the present invention will be better understood from the following description.<br>
As used herein the term "hair" to be treated may be "living" i.e. on a living body or may be "nonliving" i.e. in a wig, hairpiece or other aggregation of non-living keratinous fibers. Mammalian, preferably human hair is preferred. However wool, fur and other keratin containing fibers are suitable substrates for the compositions according to the present invention.<br>
All percentages are by weight of the total composition unless specifically stated otherwise. When more than one composition are used during a treatment, the total weight to be considered is the total weight of all the compositions applied on the hair simultaneously (i.c. the weight found "on head") unless otherwise specified. All ratios are weight ratios unless specifically stated otherwise. All molar concentrations are by volume of the total composition and presented as number of moles of component(s) in one litre of the composition, or "mole/1". When more than one composition arc used during a treatment, the total volume to be considered is the total volume of all the compositions applied on the hair simultaneously (i.e. the volume found "on head") unless otherwise specified.<br>
Carbonate ion source<br>
According to the present invention the compositions comprise upon mixing preferably at least about 0.1 mole/1, more preferably at least about 0.25 mole/1 of a source of carbonate ions or carbamate ions or hydrogencarbonate ions or peroxymonocarbonate ions or any mixture thereof. This amount can be achieved for example by addition of at least about 2.40% (volume percent) of ammonium carbonate (molecular weight equals to 96.09 g/mol) to the composition of invention or, for example, by addition of about 1.0% (volume percent) of Ammonium Carbonate and at least about 1.46% (volume percent) of Potassium Hydrogen Carbonate (molecular weight equals 100.12 g/mor). The compositions of the present invention even more preferably comprises from about 0.4 mole/1 to about 2.0 mole/1, most preferably from about 0.5 mole/1 to about 1.5 mole/1 of the source of said ions.<br>
It should also be understood that when the composition of the invention is used as a hair colouring or bleaching kit comprising an individually packaged oxidizing component and an individually packaged second component such as a bleaching or colouring component, the concentration of the source of the ions will be increased in the bleaching or colouring component proportionally to the mixing ratio of components in order to achieve the desired concentration upon mixing of the components.<br>
Any source of these ions may be utilized. Suitable sources for use herein include sodium, potassium, lithium, calcium, magnesium, barium, ammonium salts of carbonate, carbamate and hydrogencarbonate ions and mixtures thereof such as sodium carbonate, sodium hydrogen carbonate, potassium carbonate, potassium hydrogen carbonate, lithium carbonate, calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, barium carbonate, ammonium carbonate, ammonium hydrogen carbonate and mixtures thereof. Percarbonate salts may also be utilized to provide both the source of carbonate ions and oxidizing agent. Preferred sources of carbonate, carbamate and hydrogencarbonate ions are sodium hydrogen carbonate, potassium hydrogen carbonate, ammonium carbamate and mixtures thereof.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, the ammonium ion source and the carbonate ion sources are provided by a single source such as ammonium carbonate, ammonium hydrogen carbonate, ammonium carbamate or mixtures thereof.<br>
Oxidizing agent<br>
The compositions according to the present invention thus form peroxymonocarbonate ions. These ions are typically formed in in-situ from the reaction between a source of oxidizing agent preferably hydrogen peroxide and carbonate ion. Consequently, the compositions according to the present invention comprise or arc used in combination with a composition that comprises at least one source of an oxidizing agent. Preferred oxidizing agents for use herein are water-soluble peroxygen oxidizing agents. "Water-soluble" as defined herein means that in standard condition at least 0.lg, preferably lg, more preferably 10g of said oxidizing agent can be dissolved in 1 liter of deionized water. The oxidizing agents are valuable for the initial solubilisation and decolorisation of the melanin (bleaching) and accelerate the oxidation of the oxidative dye precursors (oxidative dyeing) in the hair shaft.<br>
Any oxidizing agent known in the art may be utilized in the present invention. Preferred water-soluble oxidizing agents arc inorganic peroxygen materials capable of yielding hydrogen peroxide in an aqueous solution. Water-soluble peroxygen oxidizing agents are well known in the art and include hydrogen peroxide, inorganic alkali metal peroxides such as sodium periodate and sodium peroxide and organic peroxides such as urea peroxide, melamine peroxide, and inorganic pcrhydratc salt bleaching compounds, such as the alkali metal salts of perborates, pcrcarbonates, perphosphates, persilicates, persulphates and Ihe like. These inorganic perhydrale sails may be incorporated as monohydrates, tetrahydrates etc. Alkyl and aryl peroxides, and or peroxidases may also be used. Mixtures of two or more such oxidizing agents can be used if desired. The oxidizing agents may be provided in aqueous solution or as a powder which is dissolved prior to use. Preferred for use in the compositions according to the present invention are hydrogen peroxide, percarbonate (which may be used to provide a source of both oxidizing agent and carbonate ions), persulphates and combinations thereof.<br>
According to the present invention the compositions comprise from about 0.1% to about 10% by weight, preferably from about 1 % to about 7% by weight, and most preferably from about 2% to about 5% by weight of an oxidizing agent.<br>
Gel Network Thickener<br>
According to the present invention, the hair colouring and bleaching compositions comprise a gel network thickener system. The gel network thickener system of this invention is incorporated into the component part ii) of the composition and comprises a source of carbonate ions or carbamate ions or hydrogencarbonate ions or any mixture thereof. The gel network thickener system of this invention is defined as a thickening system comprising a ternary surfactant system comprising a) at least one surfactant or amphophile having an HLB of 6 or less and a melting point of at least 30°C , b) at least one surfactant selected from anionic surfactants according to the formula RnXmYM, wherein R is independently selected from alkyl, alkenyl or alkylaryl groups having from 8 to 30 carbon atoms, X is independently selected from polar groups comprising at least one carbon atom and at least one oxygen or nitrogen atom, Y is an anionic group selected from carboxylates, sulphates, sulphonates or phosphates, n and m are independently 1 or 2 and M is hydrogen or a salt forming cation and mixtures thereof, or cationic surfactants selected from quaternary ammonium salts or amido-amines having at least one fatty<br>
chain comprising at least 20 carbon atoms and mixtures thereof and c) at least one non-ionic surfactant having an HLB of 7 or more, and comprising one or more polycthylcncoxidc chains.<br>
Those skilled in the art will recognize that gel network thickener systems usually have a complex structure of networked lamellar bi-layers and / or vesicles and sometimes crystals. These systems usually have creamy appearance and fecl and arc thus particularly desirable.<br>
Without being bound by theory it is believed that swelling and thickening in gel network thickener systems is typically achieved as a result of electrostatic repulsion of ionic surfactants or stcric repulsion of ethylene oxide chains of non-ionic surfactants incorporated into bi-laycrs. However, both of these mechanisms are suppressed in the presence of high levels of carbonate salts. Surprisingly, it has now been found that by the selection of a gel network system comprising three specific classes of surfactants said surfactants being specifically selected due to the structure of their respective surfactant head groups, the system provides easy mixing with the component part i (i.e. the oxidizing agent or developer) superior swelling and thickening efficiency can be achieved. In particular the gel network system of the present invention allows for easy and efficient mixing of the component part ii with component part i of the composition containing a source of hydrogen peroxide. Furthermore, the gel network system delivers the desired mixed viscosity level, independent of the developer composition per se and its viscosity prior to mixing. The latter property is of particular benefit for example in professional hair colour applications in hair salons, where enabling the flexibility to utilize a range of different developer compositions and or viscosity is often particularly desirable.<br>
Without being bound by theory, it is believed that gel network thickener system surfactants described in this invention have appropriate geometrical arrangement in the gel network lamellar bi-laycrs, preventing bi-laycrs from de-swclling and thus resisting viscosity loss. Moreover, in certain examples addition of the carbonate salt may actually promote formation of a more extensive gel network system, leading to incremental salt-induced thickening. Tt is further believed that non-ionic surfactant of mis invention has more suppressed swelling due to the higher ionic strength in the part ii) of the composition, and thus stability is provided by the ionic surfactant, whereas after dilution with part ii) developer the concentration of ions is reduced leading to non-ionic surfactant re-swelling to provide the required additional thickening.<br>
The HLB (hydrophilic - lipophilic balance) of the surfactant(s) used according to the invention is the standard HLB according to Griffin defined in publication J.Soc.Cosm.Chcm., Vol. 5, 1954, p. 249, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>

Hair dyes<br>
The hair compositions of the present invention are preferably hair colouring compositions which comprise oxidative dyeing compositions.  Such  compositions  comprise oxidative hair dye<br>
precursors (also known as primary intermediates) that will deliver a variety of hair colors to the hair. These small molecules are activated by the oxidizing agent and react with further molecules to form a larger colored complex in the hair shaft.<br>
The precursors can be used alone or in combination with other precursors, and one or more can be used in combination with one or more couplers. Couplers (also known as color modifiers or secondary intermediates) are generally colorless molecules that can form colors in the presence of activated precursors, and are used with other precursors or couplers to generate specific color effects or to stabilize the color. The choice of precursors and couplers will be determined by the color, shade and intensity of coloration that is desired. The precursors and couplers can be used herein, singly or in combination, to provide dyes having a variety of shades ranging from ash blondee to black.<br>

Method of Use<br>
It is understood that the examples of methods of use and embodiments described herein arc for illustrative purposes only and that various modifications or changes in light thereof will be suggested to one skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the present invention.<br>
Oxidative hair dye compositions are usually sold in kits comprising, in individually packaged components such as separate containers, a dye component (also called "dye cream" for emulsions or "dye liquid" for solutions) comprising the oxidative dye, precursors and alkalizing agent which is typically ammonia in a suitable carrier and; a hydrogen peroxide component (also called "hydrogen peroxide cream" for emulsions or "hydrogen peroxide liquid" for solutions) comprising the oxidizing agent (usually hydrogen peroxide). The consumer mixes the dye component and hydrogen peroxide component together immediately before use and applies it onto the hair.<br>
vSimilarly, bleaching compositions are also usually sold as a kit comprising two or three individually packaged components typically in two or three separate containers. The first component comprises the ammonium ion source (e.g. ammonia), the second component comprises the oxidizing agent and the third (optional) component comprises a second oxidizing agent. The bleaching compositions are obtained by mixing the above-mentioned compositions immediately before use.<br>
After working the mixture for a few minutes (to insure uniform application to all of the hair), the oxidative dye composition is allowed to remain on the hair for an amount sufficient for the dyeing to take place (usually from about 2 to 60 minutes, typically about 30 to 45 minutes). The consumer then rinses his/her hair thoroughly with water and allows it to dry. It is observed that the hair has changed from its original color to the desired color.<br>
When present in the oxidative dye compositions and bleaching compositions, the optional conditioning agent can be provided in a third container. In the latter case, all three compositions can be mixed immediately before use and applied together, or the content of the third container can be applied (after an optional rinse step) as a post-treatment immediately after the oxidative dye composition or bleaching composition resulting from the mixture of the other containers.<br>
The resultant hair colouring or bleaching compositions according to the present invention thus have a viscosity of from 1000 to 60000 cPs, preferably from 2000 to 30000 cPs and most preferably from 3000 to 25000 cPs. Viscosity is measured using Brookfield viscometers with cone and plate attachment. For viscosities in the range of 0-12000 cPs the Brookfield DV-11 viscometer with S42 plate is used. 2ml sample of the composition is equilibrated at 26.7°C for three minutes before the readings are taken at 1 rpm. For viscosities in the range of 12,000-50,000 cPs the Brookfield DV-1 viscometer with S52 plate is used. 0.5ml sample of the composition is equilibrated for 1 minute at 26.7°C before the readings arc taken at 1 rpm.<br>
The present invention also includes embodiments wherein the method of colouring or bleaching the hair comprises applying a composition comprising at least one oxidising agent, at least one source of carbonate, carbamate, or hydrogen carbonate ions and mixtures thereof, and a gel network mickening system as defined hereinabove, the composition preferably having a pH of up to 9.5, for at least about 50% of the time period the composition is applied to the hair.<br>
According to the present invention the methods of colouring or bleaching hair also comprise embodiments whereby the composition is applied to the hair and preferably the mixture is worked for a few minutes (to insure uniform application to all of the hair). The composition is then allowed to remain on the hair in order for the colour to develop for a time period of less than about 20 minutes, preferably less than about 15 minutes, more preferably from about 5 minutes to about 10 minutes, most preferably for about 10 minutes. The consumer then rinses his/her hair thoroughly with water and allows it to dry and or styles the hair as usual. Such method provides additional convenience to consumer by permitting faster colouring or bleaching process.<br>
According to an alternative embodiment of the present invention, the meuiod of colouring and or bleaching the hair is a sequential oxidative hair colouring or hair bleaching method comprising<br>
the steps of at least two sequential oxidative hair colour or hair bleaching treatments wherein the time period between each treatment is from 1 to 60 days, preferably from 1 to 40 days, more preferably from 1 to 28 days, even more preferably from 1 to 14 days and most preferably from 1 to 7 days. In such embodiments the time that the composition is retained on head may be less than about 20 minutes and is preferably less than about 10 minutes and most preferably from about 2 minutes to about 5 minutes. This method allows consumer to perform colouring or bleaching process in a way similar to conventional hair washing or conditioning process.<br>
The kits described hereinabove are well known in the art and the composition in each container can be manufactured utilizing any one of the standard approaches, these include a) 'Oil in water' process, b) 'Phase Inversion' process and c) 'One-poi' process. For example, when using "oil in water" process, surfactants of the present invention are added to approximately 50% of total water amount of the composition at about 90°C, homogenized for 15 to 30 min, men cooled to room temperature thus forming gel network thickener premix; this premix is then mixed cold with remaining amounts of water, other optional components and oxidizing agent or a source of carbonate, carbamate or hydrogencarbonate ions, thus forming the second component part of the above described bleaching or colouring kit.<br>
The present invention may be utilized in a variety of packaging and dispensing devices. These dispensing devices can come in the form of separate devices which may be used independently or in combination with one another. Typically, the hair colouring or bleaching compositions are contained within separate single or multi compartment containers so that the compositions can be stored separately from one another before use. The compositions are then mixed together by a mixing means and then applied to the consumer's hair by an application means.<br>
The most common packaging device which can be used for the present invention involves storing the developer in a container such as a bottle, tube, aerosol, or a sachet and separately storing the dye lotion in an additional compartment within the developer container or in a separate container which may be identical such as a dual sachet or aesrosol systems for example or different such as a bottle and tube system.<br>
The consumer may mix the developer lotion and the dye lotion by any means. This may simply involve the use of a mixing bowl into which the lotions arc dispensed and then mixed, preferably using a mixing means such as a tool. Alternatively it may involve the addition of one of the lotions into the container of the other lotion, (typically the dye lotion is added to the developer lotion), followed by manual shaking or mixing with a tool. Another system involves the perforation or displacement of a seal located between the separate compartments of the dye and developer lotion within a single container or sachet followed by manual mixing within the container or in a separate and or additional container.<br>
An example of such devices arc the so called 'twist and go' devices. These devices allow the consumer to twist the base of a container holding the dye which enables a communication port to open that exposes the base of the bottle holding the dye and the top of the bottle holding the developer. The two components are mixed and the consumer dispenses the product by squeezing the flexible top portion of the bottle for dispensing.<br>
Alternatively more complex devices may be utilised, whereby the lotions are mixed upon actuation of dispensing. An example of such as a complex system is a dual aerosol system e.g. bag-in-can or piston. The dye and developer arc stored separately in two aerosol cans within one device, a propellant being used to pressurize the contents of the can or bag in can or piston and a valve providing the control of dispensation. When the consumer actuates the valve, the dye and developer are dispensed simultaneously out of the cans and are mixed together via a static mixer just before dispensing the product onto the hair. The ratio of the dye and developer can be manipulated by the viscosity of the products, the can pressure, or by altering the flow channel sizes through the valve. Additionally, the product can be foamed and delivered via a mousse form.<br>
Another example of such a complex system utilises a dual piston screw system. The dye and the developer are kept in separate piston cylinder systems within the system and when the consumer actuates a button, two screws are rotated such that the dual pistons inside pressurize the liquid in the cylinders and thus force the products to move through a mixing station and out of the nozzle for dispensing.  The ratios of the dye and the developer can be manipulated by the diameter of<br>
the cylinder of the package. Additionally, an in line static mixer can be used to aid mixing and such a system can be completely disposable or completely rcfillablc.<br>
Yet another system utilises one or more manually actuated pumps. The product may be premixed in a collapsible sachet. When the consumer actuates the pump, the liquid inside the pump is dispensed, As the manually actuated pump returns to the upright position it forces product from a collapsible sachet. Alternatively, a dual system can be installed whereby two sachets and two pumps are used to deliver the dye and the developer lotions to the hair. Alternatively, a single pump connected to two sachets can deliver the product by incorporating the mixing point within the pump. Another embodiment uses a rigid bottle and a dip tube to connect the product to the pump system. Finally, a delaminaling bottle can be used in combination with a manually actuated pump where the inner layer of the bottle separates from the outer layer of the bottle which forces the contents of the bottle to be emptied.<br>
Typically these complex systems offer the advantage of product application independently of the orientation of the product.<br>
The devices described herein above can also be used in combination with a product delivery and or application tool to aid application of the product onto the hair. Again these devices may be of a very simple nature such as a nozzle attached to one of the containers or a separate applicator device such as a comb or brush. Such combs and brushes can be adapted in order to achieve particular effects, whether it be quick and even coverage or root/hairlinc touch up, or highlights or streaks. Alternatively, the container or one of the containers may be provided with a comb attached to or instead of the dispensing nozzle whereby the product is dispensed through hollow tines and dispensing apertures located in the comb tines. The comb tines may be provided with single or multiple openings along the tines to improve product application and evenness especially root to tip. Product dispensation can be achieved by mechanical pressure applied to the container for example delaminating bottles or any of the mechanisms described hereinabove. The comb may be provided on the container such as to facilitate easy application and may be positioned vertically (so called verticomb) or at an angle to allow the consumer to access all areas. All devices may be designed to have inter-changeability, so that a range of different tools for hair application can be provided to the consumer.<br>
The application devices may also include devices which assist in achieving particular effects such as highlighting such as highlighting combs, brushes and tools, foils and highlighting caps.<br>
Additional device technology can be used to assist in the penetration of the product into the hair. Examples of such technology include heating devices, ultraviolet light devices and ultrasound<br>
devices.<br>
