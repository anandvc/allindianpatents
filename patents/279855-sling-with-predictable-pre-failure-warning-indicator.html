FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to industrial slings used to lift, move and transport<br>
heavy loads and, more particularly, an apparatus for notifying operators/riggers who use<br>
synthetic slings of an overload or damage situation that may lead to sling failure.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Wire rope slings made of a plurality of metal strands twisted together and secured by<br>
large metal sleeves or collars are common in the industry. During the past thirty years,<br>
industrial metal slings have seen improvements in flexibility and strength. However,<br>
compared to non-metal or synthetic fiber slings, metal slings are relatively stiff and inflexible.<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/127489	PCT/US2006/019518<br>
2<br>
Synthetic fiber slings have gained popularity over the last fifteen years and are<br>
replacing metal slings in many circumstances. Synthetic slings are usually comprised of a<br>
lifting core made of twisted strands of synthetic fiber and an outer cover that protects the<br>
core. The most popular design of synthetic slings is a roundsling in which the lifting core<br>
forms a continuous loop and the sling has a circular or oval-shaped appearance.<br>
An advantage of synthetic slings is that they have a very high load-lifting performance<br>
strength-to-weight ratio which provides for a lighter, more flexible and even stronger slings<br>
than their heavier and bulkier metal counterparts. Even with such advances in the art of sling<br>
making, the riggers who use these improved synthetic slings still suffer and endure some of<br>
the age old problems of sudden failure and loss of a load caused by a sling breaking without<br>
warning because it was fatigued (or overly stretched) from being subjected previously to<br>
overload conditions. After a sling has been fatigued, it does not usually provide any physical<br>
indication that it was damaged - even to the trained eye. (One of the few advantages of a<br>
metal sling over a non-metal sling is that there is equipment available that can be used to<br>
conduct a non-destructive test of the metal. For example, similar equipment is routinely used<br>
to determine whether the wings of an airplane have become fatigued.)<br>
Standard break tests have been established for determining how large of a load a sling<br>
can endure. Slings are attached to a testing machine that applies a steady but increasing force<br>
on the sling until it is unable to withstand the stress of the force being applied to it and the<br>
sling ultimately breaks. Such break tests have enabled manufacturers of industrial slings to<br>
rate the load-bearing capacity of the sling. The load capacity is determined to be a point well<br>
below the load used to break the sling and also below the point where the sling is fatigued or<br>
damaged. Most sling manufacturers will affix some type of tag notice on the sling which<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/127489	PCT/US2006/019518<br>
3<br>
states the load capacity (rated capacity) of the particular sling. This rated capacity gives the<br>
maximum amount of load to which the sling may be subjected and still be considered a safe<br>
use of the sling.<br>
Unfortunately, even conscientious operators/riggers who do not take unsafe shortcuts<br>
and who operate in a safe responsible manner sometimes are surprised by a sling breaking in<br>
use even when they believed it was being used within the load limits of its rated capacity. For<br>
example, when industrial slings are in continuous heavy use over three shifts around the<br>
clock, the operators on a later shift may not be aware that someone on an earlier shift had<br>
subjected the sling to a substantial overload which may have caused serious damage to the<br>
lifting core strands of the sling. When a synthetic fiber sling is overloaded beyond its tensile<br>
strength or weight-lifting capacity at maximum stretch, it is considered to be fatigued and<br>
may never return to its normal strength and load bearing capacity.<br>
When subjected to an overload condition above its rated capacity, a roundsling can be<br>
permanently damaged/deformed if the load stretches the fibers of the load bearing core<br>
material beyond their yield point. An over-loaded sling may be susceptible to fracture at a<br>
stress point. This condition is similar to the stretching of a rubber band beyond its point of<br>
normal elasticity so that when the load or tension is removed or relieved, the rubber band will<br>
never regain its normal configuration and its strand dimensions may be permanently stretched<br>
which will cause it to fail under a load which is less than its tensile strength load. As stated<br>
previously, it is nearly impossible to determine, upon a cursory visual inspection, that a sling<br>
has been damaged because of the large size of such slings (on the order of 6 feet or more) and<br>
because the load-bearing core is hidden inside the outer cover.<br>
Once the load-lifting core of the synthetic sling is stretched beyond its yield point, it<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/127489	PCT/US2006/019518<br>
4<br>
can actually change in its physical structure and be restricted at a stress point. To date, there<br>
has been no precise method or apparatus available to an operator or rigger to determine if a<br>
sling with a protective cover was subjected to an overload or damage-causing condition. If a<br>
roundsling has been fatigued or structurally changed, the sling may no longer lift a load<br>
according to its maximum rated load capacity and, most importantly, becomes a serious threat<br>
to the operators and riggers using the sling.<br>
Thousands of roundslings are being used on a daily basis in a broad variety of heavy<br>
load lifting applications which range from ordinary construction (e.g., skyscrapers and<br>
bridges), plant and equipment operations, to ship building (e.g., oil rigs), nuclear power plants<br>
and the like. The lifting core fibers of such roundslings may be derived from natural or<br>
synthetic materials, such as polyester, polyethylene, nylon, and the like. Although the outer<br>
covers of synthetic slings are designed to reduce damage, the core fibers are still susceptible<br>
to damage from abrasion, cutting by sharp edges, or degradation from exposure to heat, cold,<br>
ultraviolet rays, corrosive chemicals or gaseous materials, or other environmental pollutants.<br>
In certain instances, the core yarn of a synthetic sling could weaken, melt or<br>
disintegrate when subjected to elevated temperatures, or to prolonged exposure to either<br>
ultraviolet light or chemicals. Still another safety concern flows from abuse by the user when<br>
the core yarn is damaged from abrasive wear when the slings are not rotated and the same<br>
wear points are permitted to stay in contact for extended periods of time with a device used<br>
for lifting (such as hooks on a crane), or on the edges of the load itself. Such abrasion is<br>
accelerated for certain types of synthetic fiber material and especially if the load contact<br>
section is under compression or is bunched. Riggers in the field are concerned that the inner<br>
lifting core yarn of their roundslings may be damaged on the inside without a means for them<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/127489	PCT/US2006/019518<br>
5<br>
to detect such defects through the sling cover. Even if the cover is removed it may be<br>
impossible to tell if the lifting core has been damaged to the point where it cannot lift its rated<br>
load. Since there is no reasonable non-destructive testing techniques for synthetic fiber<br>
slings, a synthetic sling that is only suspected of being damaged must be removed from<br>
service for safety reasons.<br>
The structural integrity of the roundsling lifting core material is difficult to determine<br>
when it is hidden inside a protective cover of opaque material which renders the lifting core<br>
yarn inaccessible for inspection. A stretched or fatigued roundsling could experience a<br>
sudden catastrophic failure without warning to the rigger, which may result in the loss of lives<br>
and property. Many in the industry have sought to provide safe slings to its riggers to avoid<br>
bodily injury, property damage and product liability claims.<br>
Several roundsling constructions are known which have a failure indicator. For<br>
example, it is known in the art to incorporate a failure indicator synthetic strand as an integral<br>
member of the lifting or load-bearing core. The failure indicator strand in prior art<br>
constructions was always an extension of the core yarns.<br>
A popular design of prior art roundslings was to twist a plurality of yarns together to<br>
form a single strand; the strand is then rolled into an endless parallel loops of strands that<br>
form the core, which is then encased in a protective cover material. If the sling was designed<br>
with a prior art failure indicator, an indicator strand would be incorporated into and twisted<br>
with the core yarns. The two ends of the indicator strand (sometimes referred to as tell-tails),<br>
extend freely through an opening in the cover material. When the sling is subjected to an<br>
overload condition, the tell-tail would partially withdraw within the cover and the freely<br>
extending tell-tail ends would be visibly shorter than the tell-tails of an undamaged sling; if<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/127489	PCT/US2006/019518<br>
6<br>
the overload condition exceeded the maximum rated load of the sling, one or both tell-tails<br>
would usually withdraw completely within the cover. In either event, the rigger is warned of<br>
the occurrence of a potentially damaged sling by either the absence of one or both tell-tails, or<br>
a "significant" withdraw of at least one tell-tail inside the cover. However, there usually was<br>
no consistency on how the tell-tails would react when triggered, even when the slings were<br>
manufactured under identical conditions.<br>
A drawback of prior art failure indicators based on an indicator strand is that there is<br>
no predictable way of determining when the failure indicator will be triggered. Synthetic<br>
slings have a safety factor designed into their construction. For example, if the sling is rated<br>
at 6,000 pounds, it typically will not be damaged unless the sling is subjected to a force five<br>
times greater (i.e., around 30,000 pounds, a 5-to-1 design factor) than the rated capacity; the<br>
tell-tail may be triggered and indicate an overload condition when the sling is subject to a<br>
force of between four to five times the rated capacity (i.e., about 24,000 lbs) by retracting into<br>
the sling's cover. Therefore, the tell-tail will provide a visual indication that the sling may<br>
have been damaged or subjected to a situation that may have been detrimental to the overall<br>
condition of the sling before the sling actually is subjected to such a condition.<br>
Unfortunately, there was no way of ensuring that the tell-tails would consistently withdraw<br>
within the cover at about 24,000 pounds.      In other words, two slings having prior art<br>
failure indicator strands contemporaneously made under the same conditions would have two<br>
different trigger points (for example, one sling may trigger at about 22,050 pounds and the<br>
other sling may trigger at about 26,000 pounds). In addition, one sling may react to a trigger<br>
event by completely withdrawing one of the tell-tails, while the other sling may react to a<br>
trigger event by partially withdrawing both tell-tails.<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/127489	PCT/US2006/019518<br>
7<br>
If the tell-tail is not withdrawn completely within the cover, one rigger's opinion of a<br>
"significant withdrawal" towards the opening in the cover may differ from another rigger's<br>
opinion. Therefore, a "small" movement of one or both of the tell-tails, which may result<br>
from the constant use and handling of the sling, may appear to one rigger as an indication that<br>
an overload condition was reached when, in fact, the sling was not subjected to an overload<br>
condition. Therefore, the visual inspection of the tell-tails in prior art failure indicators and<br>
the eventual determination of a trigger event becomes a subjective test.<br>
Another prior art roundsling construction utilizes an optical fiber strand that enables<br>
the operator/rigger to test it by shining a light on one end of the optical fiber to determine if<br>
the light can be seen at the other end of the optical fiber. In U.S. Patent No. 5,651,572 to<br>
Dennis St. Germain, it is taught to incorporate a flexible fiber optic "signal" cable into the<br>
lifting core strands of the roundsling.<br>
As indicated previously, in a roundsling, the lifting core is configured in endless<br>
parallel loops of strands which are then encased within a protective cover material. The cover<br>
will have openings or orifice slits out of which the two ends of the fiber optic signal strand<br>
emerge. The aforesaid ends of the fiber optic cable are designed to extend freely through a<br>
slit in the sling's cover so that they are easily accessible by the rigger.<br>
The optical signal strand member conducts light from a light source at one end to an<br>
observer looking at the opposite end for testing the integrity and the continuity of the core<br>
strands. The inclusion of the fiber optic cable in the lifting core yarn of the roundsling<br>
converts the inaccessible inner core area into an observable test check area by means of the<br>
passage of light through the fiber optic component of the lifting core.<br>
Fiber optic materials are capable of transmitting light into endless parallel relationship<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/127489	PCT/US2006/019518<br>
8<br>
with the fibers of the lifting core yarn. This fiber optic signal strand comprises fiber or rod<br>
material which permits the propagation of light that enters the fiber material at one end and is<br>
totally reflected back inward repeatedly from the fiber wall through the entire length of the<br>
fiber optic strand which enables the light being transmitted within the fiber optic cable to pass<br>
from one end of the fiber optic cable to the other end. If the light emerges at the other end of<br>
the fiber optic cable, it indicates that the integrity of the fiber optic cable throughout the path<br>
of the roundsling lifting core bundle is intact and, by reasoning, the integrity of the lifting<br>
core yarns are also intact.<br>
Since the fiber optic cable member is incorporated into the lifting core of the<br>
roundsling disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,651,572, it tends to develop somewhat similar<br>
breaking or snapping characteristics as the lifting core fiber materials. If the fibers of lifting<br>
core yarn break or fracture, then the fiber optic cable will also be damaged which will prevent<br>
the transmission of light from one end to the other end of the emerging fiber optic cable. If<br>
the light fails to pass from one end of the signal fiber optic cable to the other end, then the<br>
rigger is warned that the lifting core strands may be damaged, and to remove the protective<br>
cover from the roundsling for further inspection. If, upon inspection, it is determined that the<br>
roundsling was damaged, it will be immediately removed from service, and replaced with a<br>
new sling.<br>
Although the apparatus disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,651,572 is currently the leading<br>
product for determining whether the lifting core yarns of a synthetic sling have snapped or<br>
been damaged, in the stages where the sling has been subjected to an overload condition, the<br>
fiber optic signal strand still does not have the identical stretching properties of the load-<br>
bearing core yarns. Accordingly, unless the fiber optic cable breaks completely, some light<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/127489	PCT/US2006/019518<br>
9<br>
may still be able to traverse the entire length of the fiber optic cable such that the degradation<br>
in the intensity of the light may be imperceptible to the naked eye.<br>
Alternatively, the fiber optic cable, being more brittle than the synthetic core material,<br>
may be damaged by normal handling (and dropping) of the sling, or at a force less than the<br>
rated capacity of the sling. In such cases, the light transmission through the fiber optic cable<br>
may be disrupted causing the fiber optic cable to indicate an overload condition when, in fact,<br>
no overload condition was reached.<br>
Finally, under other excessive or damage-causing situations (e.g., excessive heat,<br>
acidic or chemical exposure, and ultraviolet exposure) it can be expected that the fiber optic<br>
cable will be affected differently than the synthetic strands of the lifting core. If, for example,<br>
a sling with the fiber optic signal cable is exposed to certain chemicals, the fiber optic signal<br>
cable may be relatively unaffected (or only its exterior surface is affected leaving the light<br>
path through the center of the cable unscathed), while the lifting core has been degraded to<br>
the point where it no longer meets its load rating. Therefore, as stated previously, the need to<br>
precisely determine whether the load bearing core of a synthetic sling was subjected to an<br>
excessive or damage- causing situation still exists.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention discloses a pre-failure warning indicator for use with a sling<br>
that is more accurate and predictable than prior art indicators. In the present invention, the<br>
failure indicator strand is separate and independent from the load-bearing core yarns.<br>
One of the most popular designs of a roundsling is to twist a plurality of yams<br>
together to form a single strand; the strand is then rolled into endless parallel loops of strands<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/127489	PCT/US2006/019518<br>
10<br>
that form the core. In accordance with the present invention, a pre-failure warning indicator<br>
includes a separate dedicated strand of material, a ring made of a specially chosen material,<br>
and a separate warning fiber having an elongated indicator whip end.<br>
The dedicated strand is placed proximate and substantially parallel to the loops of core<br>
strands of the sling; the ends of the dedicated strand are brought within close proximity (in a<br>
preferred embodiment several inches) to each other and are terminated with eyes or another<br>
configuration that can secure the ring. The ring is inserted through or secured to both eye<br>
terminations, thereby bridging the gap between the ends of the dedicated strand, and usually<br>
forms an oval-shaped loop. One end of the warning fiber is attached to one of the eyes of the<br>
dedicated strand, and the free end of the warning fiber is placed along the ring and threaded<br>
through the opposite eye; the free end of the warning fiber is then double-backed along the<br>
length of the ring. A tubular cover material encases the lifting core and the pre-failure<br>
warning indicator.  The free end of the warning fiber extends through an opening in the cover<br>
material and is referred to as the indicator whip.<br>
In a specific embodiment, a tag is attached to the strand (and preferably one of the<br>
terminating eyes) and is also drawn through the slot so that it extends freely outside the cover.<br>
The tag is designed to provide an indicator that the sling has been tampered with or<br>
sabotaged.<br>
The ring is designed to fail when the sling is subjected to an excessive or damage-<br>
causing situation. A common damage-causing situation is when the sling is over-loaded. The<br>
ring will break when the sling is placed in an overload situation, thereby causing the<br>
termination eyes to separate, resulting in the complete withdrawal of the whip inside of the<br>
cover.<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/127489	PCT/US2006/019518<br>
11<br>
By choosing the ring carefully, relatively accurate predictions of the force needed to<br>
trigger the warning fiber can be made. In addition, the ring may be chosen to fail and thereby<br>
convey a damage situation when the sling is being used under unusual environmental<br>
conditions (e.g., excessively hot, acidic, or ultraviolet rays from, for example, sunlight).<br>
Previous indicators either of the fiber optic nature or of the tell-tail type could give<br>
false indications of an overload or other internal damage. In the case of fiber optics, the<br>
ability to transmit light can be impeded by dirt, grease, and other debris that can retard the<br>
transmission of light through the fiber optic cable by jamming the ends. In the case of tell-<br>
tails, the movement of the sling's outer cover from friction with a load can give a false<br>
implication that the tell-tails were pulling under the cover when it was really the cover<br>
moving over the tell-tails. In the current invention, these areas of confusion are eliminated by<br>
a simple visual identification of the external warning indicator. Also, the dedicated strand<br>
can be locked into place by permanent attachment to the cover. If the cover shifts, the entire<br>
assembly of this invention moves with it in concert so a false indication of overload is<br>
eliminated.<br>
Additional objects and advantages will be evident to one skilled in the art after a<br>
reading of the detailed description that follows.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
In describing a preferred embodiment of the invention, specific terminology will be<br>
selected for the sake of clarity. However, the invention is not intended to be limited to the<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/127489	PCT/US2006/019518<br>
13<br>
specific terms so selected, and it is to be understood that each specific term includes all<br>
technical equivalents that operate in a similar manner to accomplish a similar purpose.<br>
The subject invention is an apparatus and method for determining whether a synthetic<br>
fiber sling has been damaged (because of an overload or other condition that could weaken<br>
the sling's load-bearing core) to a point where the sling should be removed from service and<br>
returned to the manufacturer for internal inspection and, if necessary, repair or disposal.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail with reference<br>
to the accompanying drawings in which a roundsling having a pre-warning failure indicator in<br>
accordance with the present invention is generally indicated at 10. The various preferred<br>
embodiments will be described with reference to the drawing figures that form a part of this<br>
description where like numerals represent like elements throughout.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a perspective view of a roundsling in accordance with the present<br>
invention. Figure 1 specifically shows a single-path roundsling, but the principles disclosed<br>
herein may be applied to other slings including multiple-path slings. Figure 2 is a cross-<br>
sectional view of the roundsling shown in Figure 1 taken along line 2-2, and illustrates the<br>
primary interior components of a typical roundsling.<br>
Referring to Figures 1 and 2, the roundsling 10 comprises an inner core 12 encased<br>
within an outer protective cover 25. The outer cover 25 shown in Figure 2 is meant to convey<br>
that the cover 25 is larger than the load-bearing core 12 and moves relatively freely with<br>
respect to the load-bearing core 12 and not necessarily that the cover 25 has a cross-sectional<br>
shape of an oval. The core 12 is designed to bear the entire weight of the load to be lifted.<br>
The primary purpose of the outer cover 25 is to prevent physical damage to the core from<br>
abrasion, sharp edges on the load, etc.; the cover 25 will also help to reduce damage to the<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/127489	PCT/US2006/019518<br>
14<br>
sling when it is used in an environment that will subject it to harsh elements such as heat,<br>
ultraviolet light, corrosive chemicals, gaseous materials, or other environmental pollutants.<br>
As will be explained hereinafter, the cover 25 can also be designed to notify a user when<br>
physical damage has occurred to the cover.<br>
The lifting core 12 is preferably made of a single or multiple strands 17 configured in<br>
a plurality of endless parallel loops of strands to form a single core or multiple cores, all of<br>
which are contained inside the protective cover material 25. The use of a single strand or<br>
multiple strands in this configuration is typical in the construction of roundslings.<br>
The lifting core 12 of such roundslings may be derived from one or more natural or<br>
synthetic materials, such as polyester, polyethylene, nylon, K-Spec® (a proprietary blend of<br>
fibers), HMPE, LCP, para-aramid or other types of synthetics. The material chosen for the<br>
core primarily depends on the maximum weight the sling is designed to lift and environment<br>
in which the sling 10 will be used. Such sling constructions have a high lifting and break<br>
strength, lighter weight, high temperature resistance and high durability, compared to wire<br>
rope or metal chain slings.<br>
Referring now to Figure 3, the pre-failure warning indicator 11 in accordance with the<br>
present invention is illustrated in side view and is shown without the cover 25 and without<br>
core 12. In a preferred embodiment, the sling 10 may be manufactured with only a pre-failure<br>
warning indicator 11, or with both a pre-failure warning indicator 11 and a tamper-evident<br>
means 35. Initially, the operation of the pre-failure warning indicator 11 will be disclosed;<br>
the tamper-evident means 35 will be described later with respect to Figure 7.<br>
A separate (preferably single) strand 20 of yarn is dedicated to the pre-failure warning<br>
indicator 11. The dedicated warning strand 20 is located within cover 25; it is preferably<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/127489	PCT/US2006/019518<br>
15<br>
placed proximate the core 12 and may either be twisted around the load-bearing strands of the<br>
core 12 or it may just lay next to the core 12, as illustrated in Figure 2.<br>
In a different embodiment, it may be desired to permanently affix the dedicated strand<br>
20 to the inside of the cover 25. When a sling is used over a period of time, the cover will<br>
develop wear points at specific locations, for example, where the sling hangs from a crane's<br>
hook.  Accordingly, it is usually advisable to rotate the cover with respect to the load-bearing<br>
core 12. By securing the dedicated strand 20 to the inner cover, movement of the cover<br>
(either intentionally or non-intentionally) will not affect the operation of the pre-failure<br>
warning indicator 11.<br>
First end 22 and second end 24 of the dedicated strand 20 are terminated in eyes 32,<br>
34, respectively. The dedicated strand 20 and eyes 32,34 are preferably made of the same<br>
material as the core strands 17.<br>
The eyes 32,34 are connected by a ring 26, thereby forming an endless loop with the<br>
dedicated strand 20. The shape of the separate dedicated strand 20 generally matches the<br>
shape of the endless parallel loops formed by the core strand 17 (i.e., generally circular or<br>
oval).<br>
Although the term "ring" implies a circularly-shaped object, as used herein "ring" is<br>
defined as any closed link or band that will connect the ends of a dedicated strand.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the ring 26 is chosen to have a lower tensile strength<br>
than the core 12. The sling manufacturer may choose to do this any number of ways, e.g., by<br>
making the ring 26 out of a different material than the dedicated strand 20, cutting a notch or<br>
notches in the ring to physically weaken it, or by making the ring 26 out of the same material<br>
as, but of a smaller diameter than, the core strands 17. When ring 26 is chosen to have a<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/127489	PCT/US2006/019518<br>
16<br>
lower tensile strength, the pre-failure warning indicator 11 is designed to trigger and thereby<br>
notify the rigger or other users of the sling that the sling 10 has been subjected to an overload<br>
condition (i.e., the sling was subjected to a force that was pre-determined to compromise the<br>
integrity of the sling, and is sometimes determined to be about four times greater than the<br>
sling's rated capacity).<br>
Attached to first termination eye 32 is a warning indicator fiber 29. Warning indicator<br>
fiber 29 is an elongated strand that is placed substantially parallel to the ring, is threaded<br>
through the second termination eye 34, is then double-backed along the ring 26 towards the<br>
first eye 32, and directed out an opening in the sling cover 25. (The external end 40 of the<br>
warning indicator fiber 29 that extends through the sling cover 25 is sometimes referred to as<br>
a "whip.") Although the sling cover 25 is not shown in Figure 3, the preferred orientation of<br>
the warning indicator fiber 29 is illustrated, i.e., it forms a substantially "J" shape within the<br>
sling cover 25.<br>
Referring again to Figure 1, the whip 40 of the warning indicator 29 extends freely<br>
through cover 25. Although not necessary, cover patch 30 may be attached (preferably by<br>
sewing), to the cover to protect the opening through which the whip end 40 of the warning<br>
indicator 29 extends.<br>
The dedicated strand 20 is preferably made of similar material as the strands 17 of the<br>
load-bearing core 12; this promotes the relatively equal stretching of all components of the<br>
sling 10. In a preferred embodiment, the ring 26 has a pre-selected lower tensile strength than<br>
the material used to make the core strands; in this embodiment, the ring 26 will fail before the<br>
lifting core 12 is stretched or fatigued. Alternatively - or in addition - the ring 26 may be<br>
designed to have a lower resistance to abrasion, heat, cold, and/or chemical exposure. By<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/127489	PCT/US2006/019518<br>
17<br>
carefully choosing the properties of ring 26, a sling manufacturer can control the condition(s)<br>
under which the subject pre-failure warning indicator 11 will trigger.<br>
In one example, the sling manufacturer may design the ring 26 to fail at 70% of the<br>
tensile strength of the inner core. Accordingly, the material from which ring 26 is made<br>
and/or its cross-sectional thickness may be chosen to meet the pre-selected tensile strength.<br>
When the sling 10 is placed under a load that exceeds its recommended rating, ring 26<br>
will fail before damage can occur to either the load bearing core strands 17 that form the core<br>
12 or the dedicated strand 20. When ring 26 fails, the termination eyes 32, 34 begin moving<br>
in opposite directions away from each other, and the physical distance between the eyes 32,<br>
34 and/or ends 22, 24 of the dedicated strand 20 increases.<br>
As the eyes 32, 34 move apart, the whip portion 40 of warning indicator fiber 29 (i.e.,<br>
the end that extends freely outside the cover 25) is drawn back inside the cover 25 until it no<br>
longer extends through the cover. If the whip end 40 of the warning indicator 29 is not<br>
visible, an inspector or rigger will immediately be able to determine that the sling 10 may<br>
have been subjected to a condition that would prevent the lifting core 12 from lifting its<br>
maximum rated load and will therefore remove the sling 10 from service for further<br>
inspection. The double-back configuration of the indicator fiber 29 ensures that the whip end<br>
40 moves twice the distance compared to the distance the eyes 32, 34 move apart, ensuring<br>
that every time a trigger event occurs, the whip end 40 will completely disappear. (It should<br>
be noted that the whip end 40 of the warning indicator 29 may be shaded in a high visibility<br>
color or otherwise marked, so that its visibility or lack thereof will be more noticeable.)<br>
An important feature is that the ring 26 is designed to fail before damage occurs to the<br>
lifting core, thereby warning the riggers that they must either stop using the sling 10 in the<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/127489	PCT/US2006/019518<br>
18<br>
manner in which they are using it or, if they continue, the sling 10 will be permanently<br>
damaged. If the rigger stops using the sling, the integrity of the lifting core 12 may remain<br>
intact. In this case, the sling 10 can be returned to the manufacturer and the pre-failure<br>
warning indicator 11 can be replaced or repaired; usually only the ring 26 will have to be<br>
replaced.<br>
A primary advantage of the pre-failure warning indicator 11 in accordance with this<br>
invention is that the ring 26 may be designed to more precisely fail at a controlled point<br>
(regardless of whether it is at a specific strength, abrasion, temperature, etc.). The ring 26 can<br>
be used as an indicator of an overload condition by making it weaker than the individual core<br>
strands 17. In a second embodiment, the ring 26 can be made from a material that would fail<br>
from yarn-on-yarn abrasion damage. In a third embodiment, the ring 26 can be made to fail<br>
from excessive temperatures (either heat or cold, or both). In a fourth embodiment, the ring<br>
26 could be made from a material that would deteriorate in the presence of chemicals at a<br>
concentration lower than would damage the strands 17 of the load-bearing core. In still<br>
another embodiment, the ring 26 can be made of a material or combination of materials that<br>
would fail when subjected to more than one of the pre-determined conditions (e.g., overload<br>
and excessive heat).<br>
In all of the above conditions, the ring 26 is preferably designed to fail at the pre-<br>
determined or desired condition at a relatively precise point. For example, if the sling is rated<br>
to lift 6,000 pounds (with a five-to-one design factor), the ring 26 can be designed to break<br>
relatively close to 24,000 pounds every time. Therefore, the ring 26 can be made to fail<br>
before the built-in safety factor of 30,000 pounds and well before any damage occurs to the<br>
sling 10. The use of the predictable pre-failure warning indicator 11 as disclosed herein,<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/127489	PCT/US2006/019518<br>
19<br>
gives a sling manufacturer a more predictable and accurate way of incorporating a failure<br>
notification means into any sling it designs or makes. In other words, the present invention<br>
introduces a degree of predictability into the manufacturing of roundslings since the failure<br>
point of the ring 26 can be selected and consistently reproduced. In prior art tell-tail<br>
indicators, the failure point was unpredictable and was not consistently reproducible.<br>
A prototype was made in order to meet the following requirements:<br>
Tensile strength of 30,000 lbs.;<br>
Vertical Rated Capacity = 6,000 lbs. at a 5 to 1 design factor;<br>
Overload Warning Indicator triggers at 20,000 - 25,000 lbs. with a Design<br>
Factor between 3 &amp; 4 to 1;<br>
Lightweight: 6' prototype weighs 1.7 lbs;<br>
Double contrasting color cover: Outer Green and inner Red for easy cut<br>
inspection;<br>
Low stretch;<br>
Impervious to salt water and most chemicals including oil, diluted acids and<br>
bases;<br>
Made with K-Spec® proprietary blend of high performance core yarn.<br>
The above prototype was tested and it was determined that the whip 40 of the pre-<br>
failure warning indicator 11 consistently disappeared (meaning that ring 26 consistently<br>
broke) at between 23,000 and 24,000 lbs. and the final tensile strength of the sling 10 was<br>
32,860 lbs.<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/127489	PCT/US2006/019518<br>
20<br>
When the whip 40 of the warning indicator 29 is no longer visible, the sling 10 should<br>
be returned to the sling manufacturer for inspection and/or repair. The ring 26 consistently<br>
broke before damage occurred to either the dedicated strand 20 or the load-bearing core 12.<br>
In many cases, the sling manufacturer will only have to replace the ring 26 in order to<br>
refurbish the sling and return it service. (In the above example, the ring 26 failed around<br>
24,000 pounds and the sling 10 did not approach its maximum tensile strength of 30,000<br>
pounds.)<br>
Under certain conditions, even though the ring 26 may have been designed to fail first,<br>
the sling 10 may have degraded to a point where it must be discarded entirely. For example,<br>
if the sling 10 was exposed to an acidic environment for an extended period of time,<br>
especially after the ring 26 failed, the sling 10 (and, specifically, the strands 17 that make up<br>
the load-bearing core) may have been damaged to such an extent that it can no longer meet its<br>
rated capacity. (The selection of the material for the core is the primary factor in determining<br>
whether the subject sling is impervious to sea water, oil, acids and other chemicals. Also, the<br>
cover 25 plays an important factor in protecting the core especially from abrasion or from<br>
sharp edges.)<br>
It should be noted that a person skilled in the art, after reading the present disclosure<br>
could produce equivalent embodiments. For example, even though virtually all synthetic<br>
slings have a load-bearing core protected by an outer cover, a sling manufacturer can<br>
eliminate the outer cover (or shorten the outer cover) so that the ring 26 is visible. In this<br>
embodiment, a dedicated strand is not required and an operator can determine that a sling<br>
overload condition (or other failure condition) was met by observing the integrity of the ring<br>
26.<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/127489	PCT/US2006/019518<br>
21<br>
Referring now to Figure 4, another preferred embodiment is disclosed. In this<br>
embodiment, pre-failure warning indicator 11a incorporates a plurality of rings 26a, 26b, 26c,<br>
etc. connected together (i.e., as links in a chain) between termination eye 32 and termination<br>
eye 34. In this manner, a sling 10a can be designed to indicate whether it has been subjected<br>
to multiple excessive conditions - any one of which could cause the controlled destruction of<br>
one of the linked rings 26a, 26b, 26c, etc. and which would then trigger the warning indicator<br>
lla in a similar manner as when there is only one ring 26. (Although this example uses three<br>
rings 26a, 26b, and 26c, two rings, four rings or more rings may be used depending on the<br>
number of failure conditions the sling manufacturer wishes to incorporate into the sling.)<br>
The warning indicator fiber 29 has a secured end and a whip end. The secured end is<br>
attached to one termination eye 32; the remainder of the indicator fiber 29 is placed along all<br>
of the rings 26a, 26b, 26c; the indicator fiber is then threaded through the other termination<br>
eye 34, is double-backed along all the rings, and is finally directed through the slit in the<br>
cover 25 where the whip is visible to an operator.<br>
For example, as shown in Figure 4, ring 26a could be designed to fail when the sling<br>
is subjected to an overload (excessive weight) condition, ring 26b could be designed to fail<br>
under an excessive heat condition, and ring 26c could be designed to fail when exposed to a<br>
specific concentration of a particular chemical. Therefore, if the sling is subjected to any of<br>
the pre-determined failure conditions, one of the rings 26a, 26b, 26c will fail, causing the<br>
termination eyes 32, 34 to pull away from one another, thereby causing the whip portion 40 of<br>
the warning indicator whip 29 to completely retract inside the cover 25. In this manner, a<br>
single predictable pre-failure warning indicator 11c can be used to signal one of a multiple<br>
possible failure conditions. By marking the individual rings before assembly of the sling, one<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/127489	PCT/US2006/019518<br>
22<br>
can determine the exact condition which the sling was subjected to that caused the pre-failure<br>
warning indicator to trigger. So, for example, if ring 26b failed (and ring 26a and ring 26c<br>
remained intact), the sling manufacturer would know that the sling was subjected to a high<br>
temperature for an extended period of time.<br>
An improved synthetic roundsling having multiple cores is manufactured by<br>
Slingmax, Inc. and is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,850,629 to Dennis St. Germain. An<br>
embodiment disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,850,629 is a two-core roundsling (sold under the<br>
brand name TWIN-PATH®) which has two-load lifting cores inside a single cover. The<br>
cover is also divided into two separate paths. U.S. Pat. No. 4,850,629 is incorporated by<br>
reference as if fully set forth herein.<br>
Similar to a sling having a single core (and a single pre-failure warning indicator), in a<br>
multiple-core or multiple-path roundsling 50, each core incorporates a predictable pre-failure<br>
warning indicator 11a, 11b, as taught herein. Referring now to Figure 5, a first dedicated<br>
strand 20a is associated with the first core 12a of a two-path sling 50 and a second dedicated<br>
strand 20b is associated with the second core of the two-path sling. The dedicated strand 20a<br>
is terminated by termination eyes 32a, 34a, and dedicated strand 20b is terminated by<br>
termination eyes 32b, 34b, respectively. A ring 26d, 26e, as disclosed previously in a one-<br>
path sling 10, is incorporated into each path of the two-path sling 50.<br>
Referring now to Figure 6, whip 40a is associated with the predictable pre-warning<br>
indicator lla in the first path of the sling 50, and whip 40b is associated with the predictable<br>
pre-warning indicator 11b in the second path. (It should be noted that the warning indicator<br>
fiber 29a is attached to one termination eye 32a, threaded through the other termination eye<br>
34a, and the whip end 40a is passed through the cover 25a, and operates in a similar manner<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/127489	PCT/US2006/019518<br>
23<br>
as the "basic" single-path sling 10 illustrated in Figures 1 through 3 using only one ring 26.<br>
Similarly, warning indicator strand 29b is attached to one termination eye 32b, threaded<br>
through the other termination eye 34b, and the respective whip end 40b is passed through the<br>
cover, and operates in a similar manner as when there is only one ring 26.)<br>
Sling 50 is comprised of a two-path core; as illustrated in Figure 6 the warning<br>
indicator whips 40a and 40b are passed through the cover 25a and emerge in free extension<br>
apart from the cover 25a. This embodiment provides a pre-failure indicator for each path that<br>
can convey sling damage or overload when either core of the TWIN-PATH® sling is<br>
subjected to a load which exceeds its tensile strength or rated capacity. When this happens,<br>
one or both of the extended warning indicator whips, 40a and/or 40b, which emerge outside<br>
of the cover material 25a will retract completely within the cover thereby alerting the<br>
operator or rigger to a sling overload condition.<br>
In a Twin-Path® sling having exactly two cores, each core is identical to the other.<br>
Referring again to Figure 5, an interesting variation for a two-core sling is the ability to<br>
design into the sling two distinct and separate damage-indicating parameters into a single<br>
sling. For example, in the first path, the ring 26d could be designed to fail only at a lower<br>
tensile strength than the core 12; while in the second path, the ring 26e could be designed to<br>
fail only when the sling is exposed to a certain chemical in the environment. The whips 40a,<br>
40b of warning indicators 29a and 29b can be marked or coded in order to indicate which<br>
whip is associated with which ring so that if a ring breaks, the rigger will know the condition<br>
that was exceeded (i.e., if ring 26d breaks it was because the TWIN-PATH® sling was<br>
subjected to a load approaching it's maximum load rating; alternatively, if ring 26e breaks if<br>
was because the TWIN-PATH® sling was exposed to the chemical for a period of time such<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/127489	PCT/US2006/019518<br>
24<br>
that it deteriorated the integrity of the sling). Therefore, if a three-core sling is made, three<br>
separate conditions may be simultaneously and independently tested using the predictable<br>
pre-failure indicator 11 taught herein; a four-core sling can be used to simultaneously test for<br>
four separate conditions, etc.<br>
In this manner, if the two-path sling 50 is subjected to either one of the pre-selected<br>
conditions to a point that causes either ring 26d or ring 26e to fail, the rigger will be alerted<br>
and will have more information than would otherwise be available to him. Designing the<br>
rings 26d, 26e to fail under different situations may also assist the sling manufacturer in<br>
analyzing the sling or further improving the sling, if the sling is ever returned for inspection<br>
or repair. However, there are situations in which it will be necessary to design the rings 26d<br>
and 26e to fail under the same condition (e.g., an overload condition).<br>
The pre-failure warning indicator 11 in accordance with the present invention is<br>
designed with a trigger mechanism that will generate a magnified force on the whip end 40 of<br>
the external warning indicator 29 in order to move the whip end 40 out-of-sight almost<br>
instantaneously, if any of the pre-engineered conditions are met and the ring fails. The reason<br>
why the force on the whip end 40 of the warning indicator fiber 29 is magnified is because of<br>
the double-back design of the warning indicator fiber 29 through the termination eyes 32,34.<br>
After the ring 26 breaks, the termination eyes 32 and 34 separate at a certain speed; however,<br>
since the warning indicator fiber 29 is tied to one eye 32, threaded through the opposite eye<br>
34, and doubles-back along the ring before emerging through the cover 25, the whip end 40 of<br>
the warning indicator is moving twice as fast (and twice the distance) as the speed (and<br>
distance) at which the eyes 32, 34 are moving away from each other. Accordingly, the whip<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/127489	PCT/US2006/019518<br>
25<br>
end 40 withdraws inside the cover entirely so that there is no question as to whether a trigger<br>
event occurred.<br>
Another feature to note, is that because the whip 40 of the warning indicator 29 is<br>
moving so fast, it creates a sound that is audible to the operator. Therefore, the present<br>
invention not only gives a visual indication that a sling has reached a critical damage point,<br>
but also gives an audible warning. The audible warning is especially important when the<br>
sling is positioned so that the operator cannot see the whip 40 (e.g., when the sling is hanging<br>
thirty feet in the air).<br>
Another notable feature of the subject pre-failure warning indicator 11 is the ability to<br>
warn the rigger of an overload and other dangerous situations without affecting the overall<br>
strength of the roundsling 10. If the rigger stops lifting the load promptly after the pre-failure<br>
warning indicator 11 is triggered, the sling 10 retains 100% of its residual strength.<br>
The color code safety feature of this invention may be achieved by encasing the load-<br>
bearing core in two separate covers, each cover having a different color. For example, the<br>
outer cover could be green or blue, and the inner cover could be orange or red; since the inner<br>
cover is a different color from the outer cover, it will show through whenever the outer cover<br>
is cut or worn through. This double-cover feature provides a visible safety warning for any<br>
user of the sling that abrasion or other damage not normally detectable, has occurred.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, a pre-failure warning indicator 11 can<br>
be adapted with a sabotage or tamper-evident means. Referring now to Figure 7, a tamper-<br>
evident tag 35 is attached to either the dedicated indicator strand 20 or, preferably, to one of<br>
the eyes 32 or 34. The free end of the tamper-evident tag 35 is passed through the cover via a<br>
slit. The slit can be the same one through which the whip 40 passes through.<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/127489	PCT/US2006/019518<br>
26<br>
If the pre-failure warning indicator 11 is triggered (by, for example, an overload<br>
condition), this means that ring 26 has been broken, the ends 22, 24 of the dedicated strand 20<br>
are free, causing whip 40 to withdraw completely within the cover. Upon inspection, the<br>
tamper-evident tag 35 can be easily pulled out from inside the cover 25 along with a portion<br>
of the dedicated strand 20, as illustrated in Figure 8, when the pre-failure warning indicator<br>
11 has been triggered. If the whip end 40 of the warning indicator is not visible because of an<br>
intentional intervention by a user, the tamper-evident tag 35 will remain secure and cannot be<br>
pulled from the cover 25. In this manner, sabotage of the sling 10 can be evidenced by the<br>
supervisor on the work site. (In order to avoid work, some users will cut off the whip end 40<br>
of the warning indicator 29 in an attempt to make it appear that the sling was subjected to a<br>
damage situation and, therefore, work must be temporarily stopped so that the sling can be<br>
removed for inspection and, if necessary, replaced with a new sling.)<br>
As part of the inspection process, the inspector may yank on the tamper-evident tag<br>
35. If the tag is secure, the sling 10 is useable; but, if the tamper-evident tag 35 can be pulled<br>
out from inside the cover, the sling 10 must be removed from use because the pre-failure<br>
warning indicator 11 has been triggered. Of course, if a saboteur cuts both the whip end 40<br>
and the visible portion of the tamper-evident tag 35, the inspector will immediately know that<br>
the sling 10 has been tampered with, and should remove the sling from service.<br>
It is important to note that no other prior warning indicators have the ability to quickly<br>
inspect the condition of a roundsling. Also, prior warning indicators are not as accurate as the<br>
subject warning indicator 11. If the whip end 40 of the warning indicator is visible and the<br>
cover 25 is intact, the roundsling can be used for the next lift; if the whip end 40 of the<br>
warning indicator is not visible, the sling should be removed from service and inspected.<br>

The subject pre-failure warning indicator is the first completely pass/fail inspection system -<br>
it is a completely objective test and not subjective.<br>
It should also be noted that one skilled in the art, after reading this disclosure, may<br>
develop variations that are contemplated as being equivalent in scope to the various<br>
embodiments specifically set forth in the present disclosure. For example, the termination<br>
loops 32, 34 may be eliminated and the ends of the dedicated strand 20 may be tied directly to<br>
the ring 26. (Alternatively, slip-knots or other means may be used to secure the ends of the<br>
strand 20 to the ring 26.)<br>
Although this invention has been described and illustrated by reference to specific<br>
embodiments, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes,<br>
modifications and equivalents may be made which clearly fall within the scope of this<br>
invention. The present invention is intended to be protected broadly within the spirit and<br>
scope of the appended claims.<br>

ABSTRACT<br>
Title :   SLING WITH PREDICTABLE PRE-FAILURE<br>
WARNING INDICATOR<br>
The pre-failure warning indicator (11) is provided for use with a sling (10). The<br>
pre-failure warning indicator (11) triggers at a point that is predictable within a<br>
relatively narrow range, thereby increasing the possibility that a damaged sling<br>
(10) is removed from use. The pre-failure warning indicator (11) includes a<br>
dedicated strand of material (20) that is placed in close proximity to the load-<br>
bearing core yarns (17) of the sling (10) but remains separate and independent<br>
from the core yarns (17); the ends (22,24) of the dedicated strand are<br>
connected via a sacrificial "ring" (26). A warning fiber (29) having an end that is<br>
visible to operators/riggers work in conjunction with the sacrificial strand (20)<br>
and the ring (26) is designed to fail when the sling (10) is subjected to a<br>
specifically chosen condition (e.g. excessive weight). The failure of the ring (26)<br>
causes the warning fiber (20) to withdraw from the rigger's view thereby<br>
warning he rigger that the sling (10) was subjected to the specifically chosen<br>
condition and may be damaged.<br>
