BACKGROUOT) OF THE INVENTION<br>
(1)	Field of the Invention<br>
[0004]   The present invention relates to a process for the<br>
- -^■^" — preparation of a composition comprising a mixture useful as a<br>
diesel fuel or fuel oil. In particular, the present invention<br>
relates  to a process which enables production of the<br>
composition without the need for an intermediate separation<br>
(extraction)  step to remove a glycerol by-product ftom<br>
transesterification of a triglyceride, such as vegetable oil,<br>
(2)	Description of the Related Art<br>
[0005] Biodiesel is rapidly gaining momentum as the next major biofuel for-Energy sustainability. Biodiesel production in Europe is already on the order of one billion gallons annually, but U.,S. production is only 100 million gallons per year.  However^- the recent spike in petroleum prices, the<br><br>
increasing environmental awareness of U,S. consuraers, and the October, 2004 passage of the biodiesel tax incentive (H.R. 4 520) by Congress, providing a $1,00 per gallon tax credit for<br>
biodiesel technologies in the U.S.<br>
[0006] Nearly all biodiesel production from vegetable oil (triglyceride) foUov/s a common set of reaction pathways: first, tranesterification of the triglyceride with excess methanol and JJaOH catalyst to give fatty acid ester, which is the biodiesel product; then separation of the ester (^residual oil) liquid phase from the byproduct glycerol (+NaOH) phases-distillation to separate the ester from residual oil; and recovery of pure glycerol as a byproduct. The resulting methyl ester is marketed as an additive to fuel in the U.S., usually about 2% to 20% by volume, and so that the resulting composition is called 'biodiesel". There are oxygenates that can be added to the diesel fuel to promote cleaner burning as well. The uncertainty of a market for large quantities of glycerol from biodiesel and the need for continuous biodiesel production processes are two recognized challenges for large-scale biodiesel implementation-<br>
[0007] U.S. Patent No. 6,890,364 B2 and US2004/0025417 Al to  Delfort et al describe a process for producing glycerol acetals- for use in diesel fuels, and they are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. U.S. published application 2003/0167681 Al, which is also incorporated by reference in its entirety, describes a similar two step process. The process conditions enable the formation of the acetals, with filtration of the solid and catalyst from the<br><br>
composition produced, which is a mixture of acetals. The acetal mixture is added in an amount between 1 to 40%, preferably 1 to 20% by volume to diesel fuel and is soluble in the heating or diesel fuel oils which is impoprtant for preventing separation on storage. The acetal additive reduces particulate emissions, particularly from diesel engines and functions like an oxygenate.<br>
[0008] U.S. Patent No. 5,917,059 to Bruchmann relates to a process for forming acetals. Also U.S. Patent No. 6,713,640 and 6,548,681 to Miller et al relate to a process for preparing acetals. Both references are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.<br>
[0009] There is a need for a more direct process for the forrp.ation of znch  glycerol acetals in fuel oil compositions.<br>
OBJECTS<br>
[0010] It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a process for the preparation of an oil (diesel or heating) which bypasses the need for a separation step, usually a distillation step, after the transesterification formation of the alkanol ester of the triglyceride, to remove glycerol- it is further an object of the present invention to provide a process which reliably and economically produces biologically derived fatty acid esters for use in fuel oils, such as heating

Preferably the process comprises a further prestep,of reacting a mixture of acetaldehyde and methanol or ethanol to form the 1,1-dimethoxyethane or 1,1-diethoxyethane and then removing water formed in the reaction from the mixture.

Preferably the mole ratio of methanol or ethanol to acetaldehyde in step (a) is between about 1 to 1 and 4 to 1.<br>
• [0015] It is well known that methanol is the alcohol most used currently, to make biodiesel via a base-catalyzed, batch process. This is because methanol is inexpensive; however, methanol is advantageous from a batch processing standpoint in that it does not dissolve biodiesel or glycerol well, and thus two liquid phases are formed as reaction progresses. The batch process takes advantage of these two phases in that they offer an economical means of separating biodiesel from byproduct glycerol at the end of reaction. In the present continuous process, which involves a fixed-bed reactor and a reactive distillation column, it is desirable to maintain a single reaction phase such that all reactants can achieve intimate contact with each other. Ethanol is a substantially better<br><br>
solvent than methanol for glycerol and biodiesel, such that in a relatively small e::K.ce^t5 of ethanol only a single reaction phase is present- This single phase leads to much more<br>
is a preferred alcohol from a processing standpoint. [0016] In addition to achieving better solubilities, ethanol is a desirable component to include in biodiesel. The fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) that constitute *^ethyl" biodiesel have better fuel properties than fatty acid methyl esters of traditional biodiesel. Ethanol is a "green" fuel, as it is derived from renewable feedstocks such as corn and biomass. Ethanol may have better long-term price stability than methanol, which is desired from natural gas, because ethanol production processes from corn and biomass are stiill iittproving whereas natural gas prices are expected to trend even higher in the next several years. Finally, ethanol is less toxic than methanol, and diesel fuel can withstand the presence of low<br><br>

[0018] Acetal synthesis -without producing water in reactive distillation is important in that water liberated in glycerol acetal formation could hydrolyze methyl eBters and degrade solid acid catalysts. This can be avoided via the formation of intermediate 1,1-DME as acetal-producing species in a separate reaction vessel as a prestep. 1,1-DME (a 1,1-DEE) is then fed into the RD column, where it reacts with glycerol and liberates metha:^ol (or ethanol) .<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0023] The process for biodiesel production uses reactive distillation to completely convert vegetable oil to biodiesel or fuel and while simultaneously converting glycerol to an acetal derivative suitable for inclusion in biodiesel as a fuel additive. Formation and inclusion of this acetal glycerol derivative into biodiesel is important for several reasons: 1) it adds to the overall mass yield of fuel produced; 2) it removes glycerol as it is formed during transesterification.   allowina  that  ecfuilibrium-limited<br><br>
reaction to proceed to completion; and 3) it removes the necessity and liability of downstream recovery, purification and sale, or disposal of glycerol. Moreover, the proposed Qrocess vises solid acid catalvsts such ^s ion ^rxchange r.^sin3 instead of soluble base, thus avoiding the cost of recovering and disposing of a base from the process.<br>
[0024] The glycerol is preferably converted to its acetal derivative in situ after transesterification. The resulting glycerol acetal is thus a biodiesel fuel additive. Aldehydes or ketones readily react with vicinal diols in the presence of acid to form cyclic acetals; Scheme 1 shows the reaction of glycerol with acetaldehyde to form 4-hydroxyTOethyl-2-Tnethyl-1,3-dioxolane (HMD) and byproduct water.<br><br>
Scheme 1, Formation of glycerol acetal (HMD) from glycerol and acetaldehyde,<br>
[0025] Reaction of acetaldehyde with glycerol also forms the six-member cyclic acetal (5-hydroxytnethyl-2-methyl-1,3-dioxane) via the CI and C3 glycerol hydroxyl groups, so the final HMD product is a mixture of isomers. The acetal products are volatile (b.p. 1S0-200'*C) compounds with good combustion properties- Any aldehyde or ketone can be used, but acetaldehyde is a preferred reactant because it can be readily and reproducibly made by catalytic oxidation of ethanol.   Delfort et al  (cit-_^r5 7^r*^^HrMioi^T\ H=»= ^^r.^^^^-i..<br><br>
reported that addition of 5 wt% glycerol acetal mixtures (HMD) to  diesel  fuel  improves  diesel  fuel  performance,  with particulate emissions lowered by 10-30%.  Thus, HMD is a good fuel additive for inclusion in the final biodi^sel product -[0026]    The process is shown in Figure 1,  Vegetable oil is first partially converted via transesterification  in  a continuous prereactor (fixed bed, stirred, bubble or other multiphase configuration) containing a solid acid catalyst. Either ethanol or methanol, or a mixture of the two, can be effectively used as the alcohol feed; methanol is cheaper, but ethanol better solubilises all species into a single phase. [0027]    Because  transesterification  is  an  equilibrium-limited reaction, the prereactor column i effluent stream is a mixture of biodiesel, unreacted oil, glycerol, and alcohol. This stream is fed to the top of a continuous, countercurrent flow reactive distillation colunm 2, A mixture of alcohol and acetaldehyde are fed near the bottom of the column.  Reactive distillation columns usually contain three sections or zones, an enriching zone to purify the top product, a reactive zone containing the solid catalyst in which reactions take place, and a stripping sone to purify the bottoms product.  With the reactive zone of the column operating near 80°C to 200°C preferably 130'C to leCC, the volatile alcohol, aldehyde, and any water present move upward in the column as vapors, while the estisr, oil, and glycerol move downward as liquids.  In the reactive zone, the alcohol contacts unreacted or partially reacted triglycerides such that further transesterification to fatty acid ester takes place.  Simultaneously, acetaldehyde reacts with glycerol to form the acetal derivatives, with<br><br>
product water entering Che vapor phase and exiting the top of the column away from the biodiesel product. Thus, a.s the liquid phase moves downward in the column, glycerol is converted to HMD and removed as a -oroduct. of transesterification, allowing the equilibrium biodiesel formation reaction to proceed to completion.<br>
[0028] Pure biodiesel and HMD exit the bottom of the column with no further purification necessary. Water, alcohol, and acetaldehyde exit the top of the column, where unreacted acetaldehyde and alcohol are recovered and recycled via simple distillation.<br>
[0029] Figure 2 shows the result of a process simulation using AspenPlus process simulation software. The simulation has been conducted by accounting for only the equilibrium phase and reaction behavior among the species in the system-It thus tests the thermodynamic feasibility of the proposed process. Two reactors ax^e simiilated - a prereactor where the feed to the process is partially converted to biodiesel, and second the reactive distillation column wherein the completion of transesterification takes place and formation of the glycerol acetals take place.<br>
[0030] Stream 1 {triglyceride - in this case triolein, a model triglyceride) and Stream 2 (methanol) are mixed in the stirred prereactor to give 96% conversion of triglycerides and an exit Stream 3 containing small quantities of unreacted triglycerides. Stream 3 is fed to the reactive distillation column along with Stream 4, a combination of methanol and acetaldehyde. In the 15 stage column, complete conversion of triglycerides  is  achieved  along  with  almost  complete<br><br>
conversion  of  glycerol  to  the  desired glycerol  acetal compounds.<br>
[0031] The results depicted in Figure 2 indicate that the thermodynaTf.ics of the continuous biodiesel process are favorable and thus that the process is feasible from a thermodynamic viewpoint. The numbers next to the distillation column in Figure 2 are the stage numbers for feeding and withdrawing streams from the column - it can be readily observed that only a small column (15 stages) is required to complete biodiesel formation.<br>
Economic aspects of the proposed process<br>
[0032] Formation of HMD and its inclusion in biodiesel incurs additional cost to supply acetaldehyde, to recycle acetaldehyde and ethanol, and to remove water. These costs are offset by the alleviation of glycerol and catalyst recovery costs, by the raw catalyst cost, and by the expanded biodiesel yield realized by HMD formation. Acecaldehyde can be purchased on the spot market (the worst-case scenario) at SO.455/lb; approximately 0,5 lb acetaldehyde (MW=44) is required per lb glycerol (MW=92). Since byproduct glycerol is formed at 0.7 lb/gallon biodiesel, the acetaldehyde cost per gallon of biodiesel is $0.16 at stoichiometric consumption rates. With the molecular weight of fatty acid esters approximately 300, addition of HMD (MW=120) to biodiesel expands the yield by about 13%, or with biodiesel at $1.50 per gallon," HMD will add about $0.20/gallon in value. Thus, this shows that the cost of HMD formation is essentially offset by the additional value it brings in enhanced biodiesel yield.<br><br>
Thi3 does not include the savings realized by removing glycerol froin the fuel oil and catalyst recovery from the process.<br>
[00 3 "51    Th-s bread invention is to form the acetyl of glycerol, either the five-member or six-member ring, in a mixture with the alcohol transesterified fatty acid esters and then burn it along with the biodiesel.  The acetal formation reaction nominally uses acetaldehyde to react with glycerol; indeed, chat is a straightforward reaction that proceeds to near completion.  The reaction of glycerol with acetaldehyde to form the cyclic acetal liberates watery and this water could be a problem in the biodiesel formation reactions in that hydrolysis of the fatty acid methyl  esters that constitute biodiesel might take place to liberate the free fatty acids, which is undesirable.  As discussed previously, as an alternative, acetaldehyde are reacted with methanol to form 1,1'dimethoxyethane  (CH3-CH- (OCH3)2) .   The reaction involves one mole of acetaldehyde and two moles of methanol to give the 1,1-dimechoxyethane and water.   The water is separated easily from the product, as 1,l-dimethoxyechane boils  at  64 ""C,    Dimethoxyethane  is  also  commercially available.  The same reaction can be conducted with 2 moles of ethanol and l mole of acetaldehyde to form l, 1-diethoxyethane. [0034]   1,1-dimethoxyethane or 1,1-diethoxyethane is then reacted" with glycerol to form the cyclic acetal and two moles of methanol in the reactive distillation setup.  No water is formed as it is when acetaldehyde is used, so that the possible problem of biodiesel hydrolysis in the reactive distillation column because of the presence of water is<br><br>
aiieviaced.  Also, 1,1-diethoxyethane can be used as well.  It is made from acetaldehyde and two moles of ethanol-[0035]    Figure 3 shows the process with the vessels for conductinq the T»=3ctions, T-l-DEE is formed ^^^ia r??^-ct"'.on of acetaldehyde with excess ethanol over an acid catalyst in 1,1* DEE reactor, where nearly complete conversion of acetaldehyde can be obtained. If complete acetaldehyde conversion is not achieved, unreacted acetaldehyde can readily be recovered from the exit stream of the 1,1-DEE reactor by distillation, because of its low boiling point {21*'C) and recycled back to the reactor feed. Water as a reaction product is removed from the 1,1-DEB reactor exit stream by methods standard to the industry such as pressure swing adsorption using 3A molecular sieves. 1,1-DEE and ethanol are then fed to che reactive distillation column where l,l-DEE reacts with glycerol to form the glycerol acetals and ethanol. In this mode of operation, water is excluded from the reactive distillation column and thus possible hydrolysis of fatty acid esters (biodiesel) is avoided-  Further,  this mode of operation allows water-sensitive  acid catalysts  to be  used in  the  reactive distillation column. With such water-sensitive catalysts, it is a required, standard practice to dry the triglyceride feedstock and feed ethanol prior to feeding them to the process-<br>
[0036]   In Figure 4 a pra-reactor is used to form the acetaldehyde  by  a  conventional  reaction  as  discussed previously.  The  distillate  stream  from  the  reactive distillation column contains water, alcohol,  and excess, unreactP'^ ar-i&amp;^-ftldphvde. This stream can be recovered and the<br><br>
components recycled back to the stream to give the most efficient operation of the process. Acetaldehyde is removed first by regular distillation or flash, and then ethanol and water are separated either using a dedicated ethnol-water separation system involving pressure swing adsorption with molecular sievers or by returning the mixture to the ethanol-water separator in an integrated ethanol production facility. The recycle of unused reactants in the process applies to all alternate concepts in the described invention. For example, when 1,1-DEE is used as the acetal forming agent as in Figure 3,  there  are  two components exiting  the  cop of  the distillation column, ethanol and 1,1-DEE. These two components can foe separated by regular distillation and the individual components recycled to the process.<br>
