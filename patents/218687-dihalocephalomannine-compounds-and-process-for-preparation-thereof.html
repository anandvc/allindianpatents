				<td>PACLITAXEL ANALOGS, PREPARATION<br>
AND USE AS ANTITUMOR AGENTS<br>
Paclitaxel is a well known antitumor agent and has been<br>
approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of<br>
ovarian and breast cancer. This drug is also presently-<br>
undergoing clinical trials for treatment of other types of<br>
cancer. The world-wide supply of paclitaxel, however, is<br>
limited to a finite number of yew trees and other yew species<br>
containing relatively small amounts of paclitaxel of which<br>
there is a serious shortage for human and animal tumor<br>
treatment, and as well as for use in routine bioactivity<br>
testing in the development of antitumor agents having<br>
paclitaxel-like antitumor activity. Thus, alternate sources<br>
of paclitaxel as well as alternate compounds having<br>
paclitaxel-like antitumor activity are highly desired.<br>
Paclitaxel is most often present in combination with its<br>
well known and structurally similar taxane, cephalomannine.<br>
The structures of cephalomannine and paclitaxel are shown<br>
below (I) .<br>
Paclitaxel and cephalomannine are natural products found<br>
. in the bark of the Pacific yew tree Taxus brevifolia, and<br>
other yew species including T. baccata, T. cuspidata, T.<br>
yunnanensis, T. chinensis, T. capitata, T. brownii and T. dark<br>
green spreader. These compounds can also be found in<br>
Cephalotaxus species such as Cephalotaxus mannii as well as<br>
cultured plant cells and fungi.<br>
Cephalomannine has been reported to be effective in<br>
causing the remission of leukemic tumors. See U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,206,221.<br>
In accordance with this invention it has now been<br>
unexpectedly discovered that certain novel paclitaxel analogs,<br>
specifically 2",3" side-chain halogenated cephalomannines show<br>
strong in vitro and in vivo paclitaxel-like efficacy in a<br>
variety of tumors thereby providing a viable alternative to<br>
paclitaxel and paclitaxel derivatives, such as Taxotere.<br>
The chemical structures of both cephalomannine and<br>
paclitaxel contain eleven asymmetric carbon atoms, of which<br>
nine are in the taxane ring and two are in the side chain at<br>
carbon 13. Stereostructures of cephalomannine and paclitaxel<br>
are shown below (II):<br>
The exocyclic 2",3" side-chain double bond in<br>
cephalomannine along with the number of stereocenters present<br>
in the structure of this compound suggests the possibility of<br>
the existence of numerous stereoisomers of this taxane. For<br>
example, cephalomannine can be distributed in two isomeric<br>
forms wherein the hydroxyl group at carbon 13 is acylated with<br>
phenylisoserine acylated in amino group by either (Z)- or (E)-<br>
2-methyl-2-butenoic acid leading to (Z)- and (E)-<br>
cephalomannines, respectively. In addition, it is known that<br>
cephalomannine and paclitaxel can be epimerized at carbon 7<br>
either thermally, during chromatographic procedures or in<br>
acidic or basic solutions to produce 7-epi-cephalomannine,<br>
which is shown below (III). Miller, et al. , J. Org. Chem.,<br>
40:1469 (1981); Chaudhary, et al., J. Org. Chem., 58:3978,<br>
(1993); and Wender, et al., CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, Fla.,<br>
(1995). Thus, during halogenation the 2",3" side chain<br>
positions can give rise to a mixture of diastereomeric<br>
products.<br>
Therefore, in addition to that set forth above the<br>
invention provides isolated and purified diastereomers of<br>
2", 3"-dihalocephalomannine and 2",3"dihalo-7-epi-<br>
cephalomannine, which show strong antitumor efficacy.<br>
The present invention provides novel analogs of<br>
paclitaxel, specifically isolated and purified 2",3"<br>
dihalocephalomannine and 2",3" dihalo-7-epi-cephalommannine<br>
diastereomers, which show strong in vitro and in vivo<br>
paclitaxel-like antitumor activity in a variety of tumor cell<br>
lines. The invention also provides methods for the<br>
preparation of these compounds and their use in tumor<br>
treatment.<br>
In accordance with this invention, the diastereomeric<br>
mixture of dihalocephalomannine analogs are prepared in good<br>
yields from either relatively refined sources of<br>
cephalomannine or from complex unpurified mixtures comprising<br>
cephalomanine, paclitaxel and other taxane compounds. The<br>
analogs are prepared by selective halogenation of the<br>
unsaturated side-chain of the cephalomannine molecule, while<br>
leaving other portions or moieties of the molecule or other<br><br>
important taxane compounds in the mixture, such as paclitaxel,<br>
intact.<br>
Separation and purification of individual 2",3"-<br>
dihalocephalomannine/dihalo-7-epi-cephalomannine diastereomers<br>
from the mixture is accomplished by conventional methods, and<br>
these compounds also show strong anti-tumor efficacy.<br>
The selective halogenation is "carried out by reacting<br>
cephalomannine and/or 7-epi-cephalomannine under conditions<br>
inclusive of a temperature and time effective to selectively<br>
halogenate the 2",3" side-chain portion of these compounds,<br>
and then separating the resulting less polar mixture of<br>
dihalocephalomannine/dihalo-7-epi-cephalomannine diastereomers<br>
from paclitaxel and other taxane compounds. Individual<br>
diastereomers can be isolated from the mixture and purified by<br>
standard chromatographic techniques and/or recrystallization.<br>
The synthetic methods of this invention are<br>
advantageously independent of the concentration of<br>
cephalomannine and 7-epi-cephalomannine present in various<br>
complex or more refined mixtures of taxane compounds and can<br>
utilize any source containing cephalomannine and/or 7-epi-<br>
cephalomannine as starting material. Representative examples<br>
of sources include the bark from various Taxus species, such<br>
as Taxus brevifolia, Taxus baccata, Taxus yunnanensis, Taxus<br>
chinenesis and Taxus wallichiana; from Cephalotaxus species<br>
such as Cephalotaxus mannii, plant material; leaves, needles<br>
and twigs from various Taxus and Cephalotaxus species,<br>
extracts of biomass containing a complex mixture of taxane<br>
type compounds, as well as in the -downstream purification of<br>
cephalomannine and 7-epi-cephalomannine produced from sources<br>
such as cell cultures of Taxus and Cephalotaxus species and<br>
cephalomannine-producing fungi.<br>
In one example of this invention, a mixture of taxanes<br>
comprising cephalomannine and/or 7~epi-cephalomannine in<br>
addition to paclitaxel is treated with stoichiometric<br>
quantities of halogen, such as for example, bromine or<br>
chlorine dissolved in an inert solvent, preferably a<br>
chlorinated solvent such as carbon tetrachloride, chloroform,<br>
methylene chloride or ethylene dichloride. In a typical<br>
treatment, for example, using a mixture containing<br>
approximately 30 wt. % cephalomannine with halogen in carbon<br>
tetrachloride results in a quantitative yield of a mixture of<br>
2", 3"-dihalocephalomannine diastereomers and the corresponding<br>
2" , 3"-dihalo-7-epi-cephalomannine diastereomers. The general<br>
reaction scheme (IV) is as follows:<br>
and X = halogen<br>
The resulting pure dihalo-diastereomers I-IV can be<br>
separated and their chemical structures elucidated by-<br>
conventional analytical and physicochemical techniques.<br>
Further in accordance with this invention, for mixtures<br>
containing cephalomannine and/or 7-epi-cephalomannine and from<br>
about 0.01% wt. to about 95.05% wt. paclitaxel, the process is<br>
similar to that described above. The mixture is first<br>
dissolved in an inert solvent, preferably carbon<br>
tetrachloride, chloroform, 1,2-dichloroethane or methylene<br>
chloride which is reacted with a halogen, for example, a<br>
solution of bromine or chlorine in an inert chlorinated<br>
solvent, and the reaction stirred until cephalomannine is<br>
completely reacted. It is preferred that the reaction be run<br>
at temperatures between -20°C and 20°C and more preferably<br>
between -5°C and 5°C, preferably in the dark. The preferred<br>
halogen solution is bromine or chlorine in carbon<br>
tetrachloride of from 0.01M to 0.1M. To ensure that reaction<br>
conditions favor the production of the desired 2",3"-<br>
dihalocephalomannine and/or 2" ,-3 "-dihalo-7-epi-cephalomanni-ne<br>
diasteromeric reaction products, reaction progress can be<br>
conveniently monitored by conventional analytical techniques,<br>
for example, HPLC, and the appropriate reaction conditions<br>
maintained.<br>
The reaction mixture containing taxane impurities can<br>
then be separated and purified by conventional methods such as<br>
chromotography and recrystallization and the individual<br>
separated and purified diastereomers made available for<br>
antitumor treatment.<br>
Conventional wisdom would lead one to expect that the use<br>
of halogen in the presence of taxane compounds having several<br>
functional groups would result in undesired side reactions,<br>
thereby depleting the concentration of cephalomannine and/or<br>
7-epi-cephalomannine and halogen without generating the<br>
desired dihalocephalomannines, or appreciable yields thereof.<br>
It would also be expected that other valuable taxanes such as<br>
paclitaxel would be degraded by such halogenation. However,<br>
in accordance with this invention it has been found that<br>
selectivity for halogenation of the 2",3"-side-chain double<br>
bond in cephalomannine and 7-epi-cephalomannine is very high<br>
under controlled conditions, with paclitaxel neither<br>
significantly degraded nor halogenated. As mentioned above,<br>
any undesired degradation or reaction products during<br>
halogenation can be avoided and the effective conditions<br>
adjusted appropriately without undue experimentation by<br>
monitoring the reaction, for example, by HPLC.<br>
The molar equivalents of halogen used in this invention<br>
are dependent upon cephalomannine and/or 7-epi-cephalomannine<br>
content and presence or absence of other unsaturated<br>
compounds. In general, a less pure mixture, i.e. a mixture<br>
containing large amounts of unsaturated taxanes relative to<br>
cephalomannine and 7-epi--cephalomannine will require a higher<br>
molar equivalent of halogen to halogenate all or substantially<br>
all of the cephalomannine and/or 7-epi-cephalomannine present<br>
in the mixture. Structures of various other unsaturated<br>
taxanes typically present along with cephalomannine, 7-epi-<br>
cephalomannine and paclitaxel in plant extracts are shown<br>
below (V):<br>
The following examples are provided to illustrate preferred<br>
embodiments of the invention, specifically selective<br>
bromination and chlorination of samples containing<br>
cephalomannine, 7-epi-cephalomannine, paclitaxel and other<br>
taxanes, all present in varying amounts, and without<br>
example, of paclitaxel. Examples are also provided which<br>
demonstrate the antitumor efficacy of the inventive<br>
dihalocephalomannine/dihalo-7-epi-cephalomannine compounds.<br>
These examples are only intended for the illustration of<br>
some preferred embodiments of this invention, and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the invention as defined by the<br>
claims.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
BROMINATION OF A PARTIALLY PURIFIED<br>
MIXTURE CONTAINING CEPHALOMANNINE<br>
A solution of 0.63g of 91.5% cephalomannine (0.0007<br>
moles), also containing about 6-7% paclitaxel, dissolved in<br>
150 ml carbon tetrachloride was added to a 500ml three neck<br>
round bottom flask fitted with a 250 ml separatory funnel.<br>
The flask was then immersed in an ice-salt bath. When the<br>
temperature reached -5°C, a solution of bromine (0.1221 g) in<br>
carbon tetrachloride (76.31 ml, 0.01 M) was added slowly with<br>
stirring at such a rate that the reaction temperature did not<br>
exceed 5°C. The cephalomannine to bromine ratio was 1:1.1<br>
mole. This addition required about three hours and the<br>
resulting solution was light brown and cloudy.<br>
The bromination was monitored by HPLC analysis every<br>
hour. The reaction was completed when all the cephalomannine<br>
present was converted to the 2", 3"-dibromoderivative, which,<br>
based on HPLC analysis, required approximately 8 hrs. The<br>
reaction mixture was light yellow to colorless, due to the<br>
consumption of the bromine, in contrast to the darker starting<br>
solution.<br>
The reaction mixture was then transferred to a one litre<br>
separatory funnel and first washed with 0.5% aqueous sodium<br>
sulfite (300 ml), 0.5% aqueous sodium bicarbonate (300 ml) and<br>
then twice with deionized water (200 ml each) to a final pH<br>
6.5. The combined aqueous layer was extracted once with CH2C12<br>
and the CH2C12 layer mixed with the previous organic extract.<br>
The organic layer was next dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and<br>
evaporated to dryness. The yield was 0.76 g of a light cream-<br>
colored solid which is approximately a 100% yield based on the<br>
starting material.<br>
The cream colored solid material was chromatographed on a<br>
column of silica gel (50g, ICN Silitech, 32-63 D, 60 A) using<br>
the solvent mixture acetone:CH2C12 (10:90) as the eluent.<br>
Fifty ml fractions were collected and checked by TLC (Silica<br>
gel 60 F254, Merck #5554, developed with acetone/CH2Cl2 : 20/80,<br>
detected using vanillin-sulfuric acid in methanol spray<br>
reagent). The fractions with a single spot at Rf = 0.64<br>
(fractions #26 - #3 8) were mixed, concentrated to dryness to<br>
yield 0.485 g of a light cream powder, which was<br>
recrystallized to white crystalline solid, mp 158°C, and<br>
identified as 2", 3"-dibromocephalomannine by physico-chemical<br>
methods (TLC, HPLC, UV, IR, NMR, MS). The yield was estimated<br>
to be 70% on the basis of starting cephalomannine.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
BROMINATION OF A CRUDE MIXTURE CONTAINING<br>
CEPHALOMANNINE, PACLITAXEL AND<br>
OTHER TAXANE-TYPE COMPOUNDS<br>
Using similar apparatus as used in Example 1, a sample of<br>
crude paclitaxel (2.0 g) having a mixture of 51.2% paclitaxel<br>
28.8% cephalomannine, and about 20% other taxanes or non-<br>
taxane impurities based on HPLC was dissolved in 150 ml carbon<br>
tetrachloride and 150 ml CH2C12, to yield a clear, light yellow<br>
solution. The flask was immersed in an ice-salt bath and<br>
stirred. When the temperature reached -5oC, a solution of<br>
0.1332 g 100% bromine in 83.13 ml (0.01 M) of carbon<br>
tetrachloride (1 mole cephalomannine : 1.2 moles bromine) was<br>
added to the solution at such a rate that the temperature of<br>
the reaction mixture did not exceed 5°C. The addition required<br>
about three hours and resulted in a cloudy, brownish-yellow<br>
solution. After the addition of bromine was completed, the<br>
reaction was allowed to continue under the same conditions for<br>
an additional 8 hours, with HPLC analysis of the paclitaxel<br>
and cephalomannine performed every hour. The reaction was<br>
complete when the solution is colorless or light yellow and<br>
all the cephalomannine has been converted to the dibromo<br>
derivative. If after the additional 8 hours the solution<br>
still contained more than 1-2% cephalomannine, keeping the<br>
initial conditions, 10 ml 0.01 M bromine in carbon<br>
tetrachloride was added dropwise and allowed to react for 1<br>
hour before analyzing again with HPLC.<br>
Excess bromine from the reaction mixture was removed by<br>
washing with 0.5% aqueous Na2SO3 (300 ml), 0.5% aqueous NaHCO3<br>
(200 ml), and deionized water (2x200 ml). The reaction<br>
mixture was dried using anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated to<br>
dryness under high vacuum to yield 2.35 g of dry light cream<br>
to white powder. The dry material was then purified on a<br>
silica gel column under the conditions listed in Example 1.<br>
The ratio between the mixture to be separated and the silica<br>
gel was 1: 60, thus 120 g silica gel were used. Each fraction<br>
was checked by TLC and every third fraction by HPLC.<br>
Fractions with the same Rf in TLC and same retention time in<br>
HPLC were mixed to afford two combined fractions. Fractions<br>
(#25-#39) which showed a single TLC spot with Rf 0.64<br>
represented dibromocephalomannine and fractions (#41 - #81)<br>
which showed a single TLC spot with Rf 0.49 represented<br>
paclitaxel.<br>
Fractions #25 - #39, after concentration to dryness at<br>
about 4 0°C under high vacuum, yielded a white to light yellow<br>
solid, 0.460 g, (66.6% theoretical yield) with a m.p. 158° -<br>
160°C (chromatographic purity 96.19%) as determined by TLC.<br>
TLC materials were employed as follows: Rf = 0.64 (single<br>
spot) on Silica gel 60 F254 Plate (Merck, #5554)<br>
Solvent system: acetone : CH2C12 (20:80)<br>
Spray Reagent: vanilin/sulfuric Acid in methanol<br>
Mass Spectrum [FAB]* of the obtained<br>
dibromocephalomannine:<br>
[M + H]+ = 990, 992, 994<br>
[M + Na]+ = 1014<br>
[M + K]+ = 1030<br>
Concentration of the second combined fractions (#41 -<br>
#81) yielded 1.16 g (&gt;100% theoretical yield) paclitaxel,<br>
which was recrystallized using 50 : 50 acetone/hexane,<br>
filtered, washed with the same ratio of cooled solvent and<br>
dried under high vacuum at 40°C for 24 hrs. The yield was<br>
0.902 g (45.11% based on the starine-material and 88.08% based<br>
on the HPLC analysis of paclitaxel in the starting material)<br>
of a white crystalline material with a m.p. of 214°C - 216°C.<br>
TLC analysis materials: Rf = 0.49 in the presence of<br>
authentic sample on silica gel 60 F254 plate [Merck #5554]<br>
Solvent system: acetone/CH2Cl2 (20:80)<br>
Spray Reagent: vanilin/sulfuric acid in methanol<br>
Both the UV and the IR spectra of the resulting material<br>
match those of pure paclitaxel thereby demonstrating the high<br>
selectivity of the bromination reaction for the 2", 3"<br>
unsaturated side chain positions of cephalomannine while<br>
leaving its close analog paclitaxel untouched.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
SCALED-UP EXAMPLE ILLUSTRATING BROMINATION<br>
OF A CRUDE MIXTURE CONTAINING CEPHALOMANNINE<br>
A solution of 10.00 g crude paclitaxel (on the basis of<br>
HPLC analysis the content was 28.8% cephalomannine, 51.2%<br>
paclitaxel and approximately 20% other taxane or non-taxane<br>
impurities) was dissolved in 1.5 1 "carbon tetrachloride in a<br>
2 1 three-necked flask fitted with a 500 ml separatory funnel,<br>
reflux condenser, thermometer and magnetic stirrer and.<br>
immersed in an ice-salt bath. The reaction mixture was<br>
stirred until the temperature reached -5°C and then 41.2 ml of<br>
0.1 M bromine (0.665g bromine) in carbon tetrachloride was<br>
added dropwise for about 3 hours. The molar ratio between<br>
cephalomannine and bromine was 1 : 1.2. The temperature did<br>
not exceed 5°C. After the bromine addition was completed,<br>
stirring was continued while maintaining the temperature at<br>
-1°C to 5°C. The reaction was monitored by HPLC every hour<br>
until all the cephalomannine had been converted to the dibromo<br>
derivatives (approximately 8 hrs.). The final color of the<br>
1500 - 1600 ml of solution was light yellow or cream,<br>
depending on the color of the starting mixture and the<br>
possible presence of a small excess of bromine.<br>
To remove any trace of bromine, the reaction mixture was<br>
washed with 0.5% aqueous Na2SO3 (500 ml) , 0.5% aqueous NaHCO3<br>
(500 ml) , and deionized water (2x500 ml) . The reaction<br>
mixture was next dried with anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated<br>
to dryness under vacuum to yield 13.20 g of a light cream to<br>
white solid material.<br>
This material was chromatographically separated on a<br>
silica gel column under the conditions listed above in<br>
Examples 1 and 2. A 100 x 5 cm glass column was prepared by<br>
the slurry method with 600 g silica gel (ratio 1:50). The<br>
column was eluted with acetone/CH2Cl2 (10 : 90). One 1 of<br>
acetone/CH2Cl2 (25 : 75) was used as a final column wash.<br>
Every fraction was analyzed by TLC and every third fraction by<br>
HPLC. Fractions #11 - #22 had a single spot at Rf = 0.64 and<br>
their combination, concentration and drying (40°C, high<br>
vacuum), yielded 3.25 g (95%) of 2",3"-dibromocephalomannine<br>
as a white to light yellow solid.<br>
Analysis of this compound is as follows:<br>
m.p.: 158 - 16O°C.<br>
Rf = 0.64 (single spot) on silica gel 60 F254 plate<br>
[Merck #5554].<br>
Solvent system: Acetone/CH2C12 (20 : 80)<br>
Spray Reagent: Vanilin/Sulfuric Acid in Methanol.<br>
As demonstrated from the following analysis, bromination<br>
of the crude paclitaxel mixture shows surprisingly high<br>
selectivity for the 2", 3", positions of the unsaturated side<br>
chain of cephalomannine, while leaving paclitaxel untouched.<br>
The fractions from #26 to #68 which had a single spot in<br>
TLC (Rf 0.49, the same as the authentic sample of paclitaxel)<br>
and a single peak in the HPLC, were combined, concentrated and<br>
dried, (40°C, high vacuum lmm to 2mm) to yield 6.10 g of a<br>
white solid. This material was crystallized from 60 ml of a<br>
mixture of acetone/hexane mixture (50:50), filtered, washed<br>
with the same ratio of cooled solvents and dried under high<br>
vacuum at 40oC (24 hrs.) to obtain 4.84 g (92%) of a white<br>
crystalline solid identified by comparison to an authentic<br>
sample as paclitaxel.<br>

EXAMPLE 4<br>
ISOLATION AND PURIFICATION OF<br>
2",3"-DIBROMOCEPHALOMANNINE DIASTEREOMERS<br>
4.1 Raw materials<br>
Batches of crude plant extracts from Taxus yunnanensis<br>
having approximately 15-40% cephalomannine, 50-70 %<br>
paclitaxel, and approximately 20-35 % other taxane/non-taxane<br>
components were obtained either from Seattle, Oregon, Western<br>
yew (T. brevifolia) , or from the Peoples Republic of China (T.<br>
yunnanensis or T. wallachiana). Bromine reagent was obtained<br>
from Fisher Scientific. Silica gel used was ICN Silitech, 32-<br>
63 urn, 60 A, ICN Biomedicals, Inc., Aurora, OH. All. solvents<br>
used were either HPLC or ACS grade and were obtained from<br>
Spectrum Chemical Mfg. Corp. Purified water used was<br>
deionized in-house.<br>
4.2 Bromination of Crude Plant Extract<br>
Crude plant extract (10.0 g, 26.4 % cephalomannine) was<br>
dissolved in chloroform so that a total of 250 ml solution was<br>
obtained. To the solution cooled in an ice bath and<br>
continually stirred with a magnetic stirrer was added carbon<br>
tetrachloride (4750 ml). To the cooled solution (4°C) was<br>
added dropwise 0.1 M bromine in carbon tetrachloride (40 ml).<br>
HPLC analysis of this mixture indicated a ratio of paclitaxel<br>
to cephalomannine peak areas 2.6 to 1. The reaction mixture<br>
was stirred in the dark with the temperature gradually rising<br>
to 15°C. After 7 hrs of reaction, an additional 7 ml 0.1 M<br>
bromine in carbon tetrachloride was added and the reaction<br>
continued at 15°C. After an additional 8 hrs of reaction, the<br>
final portion of 7 ml 0.1 M bromine in carbon tetrachloride<br>
was added and the reaction continued at 15°C overnight (14<br>
hrs). Subsequent HPLC analysis of the mixture showed a ratio<br>
of paclitaxel to cephalomannine peak areas 11 to 1. This ratio<br>
increased to 12.3 to 1 after another 7 hrs of reaction. The<br>
mixture was then washed with 5000 ml 0.2% aqueous sodium<br>
sulfite solution. The pH of the aqueous layer was 8.0. This<br>
was followed by two washes with water (2x5 1).<br>
The pH of the first and second water washes were 6.5 -<br>
7.0 and 6.0 - 6.5 respectively. The combined aqueous layer<br>
was reextracted with 5 1 chloroform. The organic layers were<br>
combined, dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate (500 g), and<br>
evaporated to dryness using a rotary vacuum evaporator at 40°C.<br>
The solid residue (13.64 g) was purified by chromatography.<br>
4.3 Chromatographic Purification of Brominated Material<br>
The thus obtained brominated material (13.64 g) was<br>
purified by medium pressure chromatography using a column (6.9<br>
cm i.d., 70 cm long) packed with silica gel (ICN Silitech, 32-<br>
63 urn, 60 A) by the slurry method using 1.5% methanol in 1,2-<br>
dichloroethane. The sample dissolved in the same solvent was<br>
loaded and eluted at the rate of 50 ml/min. Total 55<br>
fractions (500 ml each) were collected. The fractions were<br>
analyzed by TLC, with the TLC plates developed with 10%<br>
methanol in 1,2-dichloroethane and detected with 1% vanillin<br>
in 50/50 sulfuric acid-methanol. Dibromo-7-epi-<br>
cephalomannines eluted in fractions 10-14 and yielded 1.42 g<br>
solids following evaporation of solvents. Likewise, the<br>
dibromocephalomannines eluted in fractions 24-28 and yielded<br>
1.64 g solids following evaporation of solvent. Individual<br>
diastereomers of dibromocephalomannine and the corresponding<br>
7-epi-cephalomannine were subsequently separated and isolated<br>
by semi-preparative HPLC, discussed below in 4.4.<br>
Evaporation of medium pressure chromatographic fractions<br>
34-54 yielded 4.79 g pure paclitaxel, m.p. 214° - 216°C, with<br>
analytical data determined by UV, IR, HPLC, MS, NMR, which is<br>
the same as presented in U.S. Serial No. 08/571,427.<br>
The final purification of dibromocephalomannine and<br>
dibromo-7-epi-cephalomannine diastereomers from other<br>
impurities was accomplished by semi-preparative HPLC (Waters<br>
Deltaprep 3000) using a Waters Deltapak C18 column, 100A, 19<br>
mm x 30 cm with 50% acetonitrile in water as the mobile phase<br>
at a flow rate of 15 ml/min. Peak elution was monitored using<br>
a Waters Lambda Max Model 481 UV detector set at 227 run.<br>
Portions of 200 mg of material dissolved in methanol (2 ml)<br>
were injected into the column. Elution of<br>
dibromocephalomannine diastereomer I peaked approximately at<br><br>
54 min. and diastereomer II at 56 min. Likewise, the dibromo-<br>
7-epi-cephalomannine diastereomer III peaked at approximately<br>
104 min. and the corresponding diastereomer IV peaked at 112<br>
min. respectively. Fractions collected from repeated<br>
injections were pooled and evaporated at 40°C under reduced<br>
pressure to remove the organic solvent. The crystallized<br>
solids were filtered, washed with water, and dried in a vacuum<br>
oven at 40°C to yield pure dibromocephalomannine and dibromo-7-<br>
epi-cephalomannine diastereomers. The preparation, separation<br>

In Vitro and In Vivo Studies Showing<br>
Antitumor Efficacty of A Mixture of Dibromo-<br>
Cephalomannine/Dibromo-7-epi-<br>
Cephaloxnannine Diastereomers Which<br>
Correlate to Known Paclitaxel Antittunor Efficacy<br>
As is known, paclitaxel and its derivative Taxotere*<br>
(Rhone-Poulenc Rhor) exhibit highly desirable antitumor<br>
efficacy against a number of tumors. These antineoplastic<br>
drugs act in a unique manner by preventing depolymerization of<br>
tubulin forming microtubules of the mitotic spindle which is<br>
essential for cell division, and thus cause cell division to<br>
cease along with tumor cell proliferation. The mechanism of<br>
action of paclitaxel, its pharmacology, etc. is described, for<br>
example, in Rowinsky et al. Taxol: A Novel Investigational<br>
Antimicrotuble Agent, J. Natl. Cancer Inst., 82:1247 (1990).<br>
In accoradance with this invention, a mixture of novel<br>
dibromocephalomannine/dibromo-7-epi-cephalommanine<br>
diastereomers has been found to exhibit strong paclitaxel-like<br>
antitumor efficacy in vitro and in vivo.<br>
5.1 In Vitro Studies (NCI)<br>
The following in vitro studies were conducted by the<br>
National Cancer Institute"s Developmental Therapeutics<br>
Program, which demonstrate strong antitumor efficacy of the<br>
inventive dibromocephalomannine diastereomers which efficacy<br>
correlates closely to that of paclitaxel.<br>
The Developmental Therapeutics Program provides as a<br>
service to the public an in vitro ant"icancer drug discovery<br>
screen using a panel of sixty different human tumor cell lines<br>
over which candidate drugs are tested at defined ranges of<br>
concentrations. See Boyd et al., Drug Development Research<br>
34:91-109 (1995), the entirety of which is incorporated herein<br>
by reference. As discussed in Boyd et al., the screen is<br>
designed and operated in such a manner that both relative and<br>
absolute sensitivities of each of the cell lines comprising<br>
the screen are reproducible to the degree that a<br>
characteristic profile ("fingerprint") of a respective cell<br>
lines" response to a drug candidate can be generated." Recent<br>
studies of the in vivo counterpart of the NCI in vitro screen<br>
have indicated the in vitro screen to be an effective selector<br>
of compounds with in vivo anticancer efficacy. See Grever et<br>
al., Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 35:369 (1994). Operation<br>
and interpretation of the screen are discussed in detail in<br>
Boyd et al., as well as in several other articles cited<br>
therein and thus need not be repeated here, except comparative<br>
results obtained from the screen between the novel 2"3"-<br>
dibromocephalomannine/dibromo-7-epi-cephalomannine<br>
diastereomic mixture represented as compound "XCLY-401759<br>
analog" and that of the known antitumor compound, paclitaxel.<br>
In vitro antitumor efficacy of XCLY-401759 is shown in FIGs.<br>
12 and 13, Testing Results and Mean Graphs, respectively.<br>
In corresponding manner, in vitro antitumor efficacy is<br>
shown in FIG. 14 by dose resonse represented by a mean graph<br>
of paclitaxel.<br>
5.1.1 Discussion of Results (NCI)<br>
In the NCI in vitro anticancer drug screen the effect of<br>
an antitumor candidate, i.e. XCLY-401759 of the present<br>
invention, on a cell line, percentage growth (PG), and<br>
calculated response parameters are discussed in detail in Boyd<br>
et al. , Data display and analysis strategies for the NCI -<br>
disease -oriented in vitro antitumor drug Screen, Cytotoxic<br>
Anticancer Drugs: Models and Concepts for Drug Discovery and<br>
Development, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Amsterdam, pp. 11-34<br>
(1992), and Monks et al. Feasibility of a high-flux anticancer<br>
drug screen utilizing a diverse panel of human tumor cell<br>
lines in culture, J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 83:757-766 (1991), the<br>
entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by<br>
reference. In general, in the screening data report, FIG. 12,<br>
and mean graphs, FIGs. 13 and 14, "GI50" represents the 50%<br>
growth inhibition factor, "TGI" represents a total growth<br>
inhibition, or cytostatic level of effect, and "LC50"<br>
represents a lethal concentration, or net cell killing or<br>
cytotoxicity parameter. Values accompanied by a "
that the dosage level or real value is a value that is<br>
something less than the lowest tested concentration, and<br>
values accompanied by a "&gt;" sign indicate that the effective<br>
dosage or real value is a level greater than the highest<br>
tested concentration.<br>
The mean graphs are obtained from GI50, TGI and LC50<br>
concentrations obtained for compounds" tested against each cell<br>
line in the NCI in vitro screen. A detailed discussion of<br>
mean graph construction is provided in Boyd et al. (1995). In<br>
interpreting the mean graphs, in general a bar projecting to<br>
the right represents sensitivity of a particular cell line to<br>
an anticancer candidate in excess of the average sensitivity<br>
of all tested cell lines, while bars extending to the left<br>
represent cell lines which are less sensitive on average to<br>
the anticancer candidate. The bar scales are logarithmic,<br>
such that a bar which extends, for example, 2 or 3 units to<br>
the right of the vertical reference line in, say a GI50 mean<br>
graph, indicates that the anticancer candidate achieved a<br>
response parameter for a particular cell line at a<br>
concentration one-hundredth to one-thousandth of the mean<br>
concentration required over all cell lines, thereby indicating<br>
that the particular tumor cell line is unusually sensitive to<br>
the tested candidate.<br>
Turning now to FIG. 13, XCLY-401759 shows a relatively<br>
high magnitude of effect in TGI, for example, on Leukemia cell<br>
line HL-60(TB); Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer line NCI-H522;<br>
Colon Cancer cell lines COLO 205 and HT 29; CNS Cancer cell<br>
lines SF-539 and SNB-75; Ovarian Cancer Cell line OVCAR-3;<br>
Renal Cancer cell line RXF-393; and Breast Cancer cell lines<br>
MCF7, MDA-MB-231/ATCC, HS 578T, MDA-MB-435 and MDA-N.<br>
In comparison with FIG. 14, analysis of paclitaxel, XCLY-<br>
401759 demonstrates an unusually high magnitude of response<br>
such as that of paclitaxel to Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer cell<br>
line NCI-H522 (
respectively). Compare also the respectively high magnitude<br>
of response of both XCLY-401759 and paclitaxel on Colon Cancer<br>
Cell line COLO 205 (
SNB-75 (-7.30 v. -9.18), and, for example, on Breast Cancer<br>
Cell line HS 5787 (-7.61 v. -9.91).<br>
The high magnitude of effect of XCLY-401759 on many cell<br>
lines is perhaps more pronounced in GI50 in which XCLY-401759<br>
demonstrates a high response level in many of the same cell<br>
lines as does paclitaxel, such as, for example, with various<br>
tested colon cancer cell lines, melanoma cell lines, ovarian<br>
cancer cell lines, and renal cancer cell lines, and thus falls<br>
within the footprint of paclitaxel-like antitumor activity<br>
thereby reproducibly demonstrating the high antitumor efficacy<br>
of the novel XCLY-401759 mixture.<br>
The strong paclitaxel-like antitumor efficacy of XCLY-<br>
401759 is further shown in correlation data generated by the<br>
NCI, as summtirized below in Table 5:<br><br>
5.2 IN VITRO STUDIES (SOUTHERN RESEARCH INSTITUTE)<br>
Additional in vitro studies were performed by the<br>
Southern Research Institute, Birmingham, Alabama, an<br>
independent research group, of the biological anti-cellular<br>
activity of XCLY-401759 on four human tumor lines, MX-1<br>
(breast carcinoma), RXF-393 (renal cell carcinoma), NCI-H522<br>
(lung adenocarcinoma) and OVCAR-3 (ovarian carcinoma). In<br>
these studies, the XCLY-401759 analog was shown to yield a<br>
range of activity comparable to paclitaxel.<br>
This testing was conducted using the aforementioned human<br>
tumor cell lines employing standard tissue culture techniques<br>
with semi-automated dye conversion assays. Selection of the<br>
human cell lines for testing was based at least in part on the<br>
following criteria: (1) histogenesis of clinical import, (2)<br>
adequate growth characteristics, and (3) the Institute"s<br>
experience with particular cell lines. The materials, methods<br>
and results of this study follow.<br>
5.2.1 Materials and Methods<br>
5.2.1.1 Cell culture.<br>
In the Southern Research Institute Study, human cell<br>
lines were propagated under sterile conditions in RPMI 1640<br>
(Hyclone) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma Chemical) , 2 mM<br>
L-glutamine, and sodium bicarbonate (complete medium) and<br>
incubated at 37°C in HEPA-filtered Sterilcult CO2 tissue<br>
culture incubators (Forma) with 5% CO2 and 95% humidity. The<br>
cell lines were subcultured weekly to bi-weekly and used in<br>
experiments. All lines were screened for mycoplasma<br>
contamination using GeneProbe™ (Fischer) and positive cultures<br>
were cured of contaminants over three passages using constant<br>
treatment with BM-Cyclin™ antibiotic combination (Boehringer<br>
Mannheim). Only lines confirmed as mycoplasma free were used<br>
in testing compounds for anticellular activity.<br>
5.2.1.2 Anticellular activity experimental design.<br>
For all experiments, cells were harvested and pelleted to<br>
remove the medium and then suspended in fresh complete medium.<br>
Samples were taken to determine cell density. The cell count<br>
was determined with a Coulter Model Z1 cell counter and<br>
viability was measured with propidium iodide staining followed<br>
by analysis on a Coulter EPICS Elite Flow cytometer. The cell<br>
samples were adjusted with complete medium to a density of 5 x<br>
103 cells/ml. Tissue culture cluster plates (96 well, cat No.<br>
3595 Costar) were seeded with 100 ul cells (5 x 103) and<br>
incubated as described.<br>
On the day of treatment analog XCLY-401759 was dissolved<br>
in 100% ethanol, and then serially diluted in medium. The 0<br>
dose control was mock treated with medium. The appropriate<br>
wells (columns of 8) were treated with 5 concentration levels<br>
(10-4, l0-5, 1d-6, 10-7, and 10-8 M) . The highest dose of initial<br>
vehicle (ethanol in media) was 
control was prepared at 0.2% to determine the effects of<br>
vehicle on the cell lines. Paclitaxel supplied by XECHEM,<br>
Inc., New Brunswick, New Jersey, was dissolved in DMSO,<br>
serially diluted in medium and then added to the wells to<br>
achieve doses of 1 x 10"8 and 1 x 10-9 M. Each cluster plate<br>
contained a cell control (8 wells, mock-treated with complete<br>
medium), a medium control {7 wells with medium used to<br>
substract out signal generated by medium conditions) and an<br>
air blank (1 well, for calibrating the plate reader). Once<br>
dosing was completed, the plates were stacked and wrapped in<br>
plastic film to reduce evaporation a"nd incubated as<br>
described. Replicate sets of cluster plates had either 1 hour<br>
or 72 hour drug exposure. For the appropriate drug exposure,<br>
the plates were aseptically blotted on sterile towels and<br>
gently washed three times with medium. The samples were then<br>
fed with fresh medium, and the plates were wrapped in plastic<br>
wrap. The plates of both exposure sets were incubated to day<br>
7 and then processed to analyze for anticellular activity<br>
using the sulforhodamine B (SRB) procedure.<br>
5.2.1.3 Results<br>
In the 1 hour exposure XCLY-401759 concentration<br>
dependent activity was demonstrated in all the tested cell<br>
lines. OVCAR-3 ovarian and NCI-H522 lung cell lines were the<br>
most sensitive to XCLY-401759. Paclitaxel activity was<br>
minimal at the two concentrations tested for MX-1, RXF 393 and<br>
OVACAR-3 tumor cell lines, with NCI-H522 showing sensitivity<br>
to paclitaxel. All cell lines showed increased sensitivity to<br>
both XCLY-401759 and paclitaxel when the exposure time was<br>
increased to 72 hours. MX-1 was relatively less sensitive<br>
than other lines to paclitaxel and XCLY-40175"9.<br>
In summary, according to the Southern Research<br>
Institute"s Study, XCLY-401759 yielded a range of anticellular<br>
activity comparable to paclitaxel in four human tumor cell<br>
lines of tested various neoplastic disease originans.<br>
The results are summarized bel"ow in Tables 6 and 7.<br>
5.3 IN VIVO "STUDIES<br>
In vivo hollow fiber assays were performed by the NCI<br>
Developmental Therapeutics Program on the anti-cellular<br>
efficacy of the inventive XCLY-401759 analog on several<br>
neoplastic tumor cell lines.<br>
This testing was performed by the Biological Testing<br>
Branch of the Developmental Therapeutics Program. In these<br>
assays, human tumor cells as indicated were cultivated in<br>
polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) hollow fibers, and a sample of<br>
each cell line implanted into each of two physiologic<br>
compartments (intraperitoneal and subcutaneous) in mice. Each<br>
test mouse received a total of six fibers (3 intraperitoneally<br>
and 3 subcutaneously) representing 3 distinct cancer cell<br>
lines.<br>
Three mice were treated with potential antitumor<br>
compounds at each of 2 test doses by the intraperitoneal route<br>
using a QD x 4 treatment schedule. Vehicle controls consisted<br>
of 6 mice receiving the compound diluent only. The fiber<br>
cultures were collected on the day following the last day of<br>
treatment.<br>
To determine antitumor efficacy, the viable cell mass was<br>
determined for each of the cell lines using a formazan dye<br>
(MTT) conversion assay. From this, the % T/C was calculated<br>
using the average optical density of the compound treated<br>
samples divided by the average optical density of the vehicle<br>
controls. The net increase in cell mass was determined for<br>
each sample.<br>
The XCLY-401759 diastereomeric mixture/compound was<br>
tested against a minimum of 12 human cancer cell lines,<br>
amounting to a total of 4 experiments as each experiment<br>
contains 3 cell lines. The data are reported as %T/C for each<br>
of the 2 compound doses against each of the cell lines with<br>
separate values calculated for the intraperitoneal and<br>
subcutaneous samples.<br>
The results of this in vivo assay are summarized below in<br>
Tables 8-11.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
PREPARATION OF 2",3"-DICHLOROCEPHALOMANNINE<br>
DIASTEREOMERS AND BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY STUDIES<br>
6.1 Raw Materials<br>
Batches of crude plant extracts from Taxus yunnanensis or<br>
from Taxus wallachiana containing approximately 15-40%<br>
cephalomannine, approximately 50-70% paclitaxel, and<br>
approximately 2 0-35% other taxane/non-taxane components were<br>
obtained from The People"s Republic of China. Chlorine gas<br>
was obtained from Matheson Ltd. Silica gel used was ICN<br>
Silitech, 32-63 um, 60 A, ICN Biomedicals, Inc., Aurora, OH.<br>
All solvents used were either HPLC or ACS grade and were<br>
obtained from Spectrum Chemical Mfg. Corp. Purified water<br>
used was deionized in-house.<br>
6.2 Chlorination of Crude Plant<br>
Extract in Oxidized Chloroform<br>
6.2.1 Preparation of Oxidized Chloroform<br>
Chlorine (3.12 g) was added dropwise to chloroform (41)<br>
in order to neutralize a stabilizer amylene, present in the<br>
commercially available solvent. The solution was mixed<br>
vigorously and left standing at room temperature overnight,<br>
and then washed once with 1.5% sodium sulfite solution (1.0<br>
1), and twice with water (2x1.0 1). Hydrogen peroxide<br>
solution (3%, 10 ml) was then added, mixed vigorously, and<br>
PH1\217512.1<br>
allowed to stand for 3-5 days. Chlorine content in the<br>
solvent was determined by volumetric analysis. Next, to the<br>
solvent sample (5 ml) was added 1.0 N HC1 (10 ml) and water<br>
(50 ml. To this mixture was then added KI (2 g) , mixed well<br>
to dissolve, and the resulting dark brown solution titrated<br>
with 0.1 N sodium thiosulfate solution. As the color of<br>
solution turned light brown, 3-4 drops of starch indicator<br>
solution (0.5%, USP) were added. The dark blue - purple<br>
solution was further titrated until the solution turned<br>
colorless. The volume of sodium thiosulfate solution used to<br>
arrive at the end point was noted and chlorine content<br>
calculated. The desired chlorine content was in the range of<br>
0.01 - 0.1%. The solvent was dried with anhydrous sodium<br>
sulfate (100 g) and used for the following chlorination<br>
reaction.<br>
6.2.2 Chlorination<br>
Crude plant extract (5.0 g, 28.8% cephalomannine, 62.2%<br>
paclitaxel) was dissolved in oxidized chloroform (1 1} in a 31<br>
flask cooled to 4°C using an ice bath. HPLC analysis of the<br>
mixture after 1 hour showed a paclitaxel to cephalomannine<br>
ratio of 8:1. The reaction mixture was then stirred at 15°C<br>
for 9 hrs. HPLC analysis of the reaction mixture at this<br>
point showed a paclitaxel to cephalomannine ratio of 19:1.<br>
The reaction mixture 5 ml sample washed with 5 ml deionized<br>
water had a pH of about 2.0. The mixture was then washed with<br>
500 ml 1.0% aqueous sodium sulfite solution, and the pH of the<br>
aqueous layer was 7.5. This was followed by two washes with<br>
water (2x500 ml). The pH values of first and second water<br>
washes were 7.0 and 6.5, respectively. The combined aqueous<br>
layer was re-extracted with 150 ml chloroform. The organic<br>
layers were combined, dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate (85<br>
g), and evaporated to dryness. The solid residue (5.85 g) was<br>
purified by chromatography. LCMS analysis of the chlorinated<br>
material indicated formation a diastereomer mixture of<br>
dichlorocephalomannine as the product of reaction along with<br>
paclitaxel present in the starting material.<br>
6.3 Chromatographic Purification of Chlorinated Material<br>
The chlorinated material (5.85 g) was chromatographically<br>
purified using a column (4.1 cm i.d., 62 cm long) packed with<br>
silica gel (300 g) by the slurry method using 10% acetone in<br>
1,2-dichloroethane. The sample was dissolved in 10% acetone<br>
in 1,2-dichloroethane. Following the first two 700 and 350 ml<br>
fractions, all subsequent fractions were limited to 50 ml<br>
each. The fractions were analyzed by TLC (TLC plates were<br>
developed with 20% acetone in 1,2-dichloroethane, detected<br>
with 1% vanillin in 50/50 sulfuric acid-methanol).<br>
Dichlorocephalomannines eluted in fractions 8-13 and yielded<br>
1.6 g solids (-90%) following evaporation of solvents. This<br>
material was finally purified by semi-preparative HPLC.<br>
6.4 Chlorination of Crude Plant Extract in 1,2-Dichloroethane<br>
6.4.1 Preparation of Chlorine Solution in 1,2-Dichoroethane<br>
A solution of chlorine in 1,2-dichloroethane was prepared<br>
by slow bubbling of chlorine into 1,2-dichloroethane (1 1)<br>
precooled to. 0 - 4°C using an ice bath. The bubbling was<br>
continued for several min. (approx. 10 min.) until the desired<br>
concentration of chlorine in 1,2-dichloroethane was achieved.<br>
Samples of the solvent were withdrawn periodically and<br>
analyzed for dissolved chlorine content as follows: To the<br>
solvent sample (5 ml) in a 250 ml erlenmeyer flask were added<br>
1.0 N HC1 (10 ml) and water (50 ml). To this mixture was<br>
added KI (2 g), mixed well to dissolve, and the dark brown<br>
solution was titrated with 0.1 N sodium thiosulfate solution.<br>
As the color of solution turned light brown, 3-4 drops of<br>
starch indicator solution (0.5%, USP) were added. The dark<br>
blue - purple solution was further titrated until the solution<br>
turned colorless. The volume of sodium thiosulfate solution<br>
used to arrive at the end point was noted and chlorine content<br>
was calculated. The desired chlorine content was in the range<br>
of 0.01-0.1%.<br>
6.4.2 Chlorination<br>
Crude plant extract (5.0 g) dissolved in 1,2-<br>
dichloroethane (200 ml) was cooled to -4°C and added dropwise<br>
to the stirred solution of chlorine (0.06%) in 1,2-<br>
dichloroethane (1250 ml) cooled to 4°C by using an ice bath.<br>
Following complete addition, the mixture was stirred at 4oC for<br>
1 hr and a sample was analyzed by HPLC. HPLC analysis<br>
indicated that the cephalomannine peak was nearly completely<br>
eliminated. The mixture was washed with 1.0% sodium sulfite<br>
solution (1 1) and water (2 x 1 1) . The pH values of the<br>
aqueous layers were as follows: sodium sulfite wash, 7.5-8.0;<br>
first water wash, 6.0-6.5; second water wash, 5.5. The<br>
aqueous layers were extracted with 1,2-dichloroethane (200<br>
ml). The organic layers were combined, dried with anhydrous<br>
sodium sulfate (50 g) and evaporated using a rotary evaporator<br>
at 40oC. The residual solids were dried in vacuum oven at 40oC<br>
for 2 hrs to yield 5.3 g chlorinated material. HPLC analysis<br>
of this material showed dichlorocephalomannine as the product<br>
of the reaction together with paclitaxel present in the<br>
starting crude plant extract.<br>
6.5 Separation of Chlorinated Material From Paclitaxel<br>
by Crystallization<br>
The chlorinated product mixture from 6.4.2 (5.30 g) was<br>
dissolved in acetone (50 ml) in a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask. To<br>
this solution was added hexanes (65 ml), mixed well, and let<br>
stand at room temperature until crystallization began to<br>
occur. The flask was then stored at 4oC for 60 hrs. The<br>
crystals were filtered, washed with cold 20% acetone in<br>
hexanes, and dried in vacuum oven at 40°C for 3.5 hrs to yield<br>
3.10 g paclitaxel (- 95%, crystals I). The combined filtrate<br>
and washings were evaporated, and the residual solids dried in<br>
a vacuum oven at 40°C for 2 hrs to yield 1.96 g mother liquor<br>
material (mother liquor I). The crystals I (3.10 g) were next<br>
dissolved in acetone (32 ml). To this solution was added<br>
hexanes (40 ml) and the mixture stored at room temperature for<br>
5 hrs and then at 4°C overnight. The crystals were filtered,<br>
washed with 20% acetone in hexanes," and dried in vacuum oven<br>
at 40°C for 3 hrs to yield 2.49g paclitaxel, 98.5% (crystals<br>
II). The filtrate and washings were combined and evaporated.<br>
The residual solids were dried in a vacuum oven at 40°C for 2<br>
hrs to yield 0.65 g mother liquor material (mother liquor II).<br>
The crystals II (2.49 g) were again dissolved in warm acetone<br>
(25 ml). To the solution was added hexanes (25 ml) and the<br>
mixture stored at room temperature for 5 hrs and then at 4°C<br>
overnight. The crystals were filtered, washed with 2 0%<br>
acetone in hexanes, and dried in a vacuum oven at 40°C to yield<br>
2,01g paclitaxel (99.5%, crystals III). The filtrate and<br>
washings were combined and evaporated. The residual solids<br>
were dried in a vacuum oven at 40°C for 2 hours to yield 0.47g<br>
mother liquor material (mother liquor III). The mother<br>
liquors I, II, and III containing dichlorocephalomannines were<br>
then pooled and further separated by semi-preparative HPLC.<br>
6.6 Final Purification of 2", 3" -Dichlorocophalomannine<br>
and 2",3"-Dichloro-7-epi-cephalomannine Diastereomers<br>
The final purification of dichlorocephalomannine and 7-<br>
epi-dichlorocephalomannine diastereomers from other impurities<br>
was accomplished by semi-preparative HPLC (Waters Deltaprep<br>
3000) using a Waters Deltapak C18 column, 100 A 19mm x 30 cm<br>
with 45% acetonitrile in water as the mobile phase at the flow<br>
rate of 15 ml/min. Peak elution was monitored using a UV<br>
detector set at 227 nm. Portions of 200 mg material dissolved<br>
in methanol (2 ml) were injected. Elution of<br>
dichlorocephalomannine diastereomer I peaked approximately at<br>
86 min. and diastereomer II at 98 min. Likewise, the<br>
dichloro-7-epi-cephalomannine diastereomer III peaked at<br>
approximately 118 min and the corresponding diastereomer IV<br>
peaked at 124 min respectively. Fractions collected from<br>
repeated injections were pooled and evaporated at 40°C under<br>
reduced pressure to remove the organic solvent. The<br>
crystallized solids were filtered, washed with water, and<br>
dried in vacuum oven at 40°C to yield pure<br>
dichlorocephalomannine and dichloro-7-epi-cephalomannine<br>
diastereomers. The dichlorocephalomannine diastereomer I<br>
isolated in this manner was associated with a contaminant and<br>
was repurified by collecting smaller fractions during peak<br>
elution following the described HPLC procedure.<br>
