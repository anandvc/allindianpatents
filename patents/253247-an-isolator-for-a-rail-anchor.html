RAIL ANCHOR ISOLATOR BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an isolator for use with a rail anchor and, more particularly, to an isolator for use with a rail anchor applied to railroad rail mounted on concrete ties.<br>
In the installation and operation of railroad rail the standard rail fastener is a spike driven into a wood tie on either side of the rail. Such arrangement is designed to keep the lateral spacing between rails to maintain gauge distance. Tie plates are also utilized as bearing pads against lateral and vertical forces.<br>
Special problems have arisen due to the use of concrete ties in certain railroad rail installations. One approach to restricting and restraining rail used with concrete ties is shown in US Patent 5,016,816.<br>
The particular problem with railroad rail mounted on concrete ties is longitudinal rail movement when holding is provided with resilient fasteners. Rail anchors can be used to restrict such longitudinal rail movement, which typically occurs during the acceleration and deceleration of trains or the expansion and contraction due to temperature changes. However, abrasions from the steel rail anchor against the concrete tie tend to erode and eventually damage the concrete tie.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved isolator for use with a rail anchor, particularly adapted for use with concrete ties.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a rail anchor isolator with improved positioning capabilities.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides an isolator particularly adapted for use with a rail anchor utilized in an application where railroad rail is installed on concrete ties.   The isolator protects the concrete tie from longitudinal movement of the rail due to expansion and contraction due to changing temperatures, and the acceleration and deceleration of trains.<br>
In one embodiment, the isolator is comprised of a structural plastic material and includes a front face section and a rear face secdon. The front face section and rear face section each comprise a generally rectangular structure, having a top edge, bottom edge, and side edges. A center section joins the front face section and rear face section and forms part of the top of the isolator. In another embodiment, the front face section includes a top section and bottom section, with the top section having a lower edge projecting laterally at an acute angle from the bottom section. Similarly, the rear face section includes a top section and a bottom section, with the top section having a lower edge projecting laterally at an acute angle from the bottom section. Both the front face section and rear face section include a positioning rib or positioning tabs on inner surfaces thereof<br>
The isolator is adapted to receive a rail anchor such that either the front face section or the rear face section of the isolator would contact the concrete tie and thereby isolate the steel rail anchor from the concrete tie.<br>
