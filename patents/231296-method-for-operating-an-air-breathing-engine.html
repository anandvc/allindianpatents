Method for operating an air-breathing engine<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method for operating an engine in accordance with the preamble of claim 1.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The prior art has disclosed methods for positively influencing the performance data of engines with internal combustion, for example a gas turboset, by evaporative cooling before and/or during the compression of the combustion air. For this purpose, it is customary for water or another liquid to be injected in finely atomized form into the gas stream which has been drawn in. The overriding significance of the atomization quality and the homogeneous distribution of the liquid introduced was recognized as early as in FR 1 563 749. The drop size directly influences the flow-following capacity and the evaporation time of the drops. When drops enter a turbo-compressor, the number of drops which strike the compressor blades, and the potentially erosive effect thereof, increases with the drop size. This means that if the drop size exceeds a defined limit value, the negative effects rise disproportionately.  Therefore,  US 6,216,443  indicates<br>
injecting drops of a size of from 1 to 5 0 jam diameter into the compressor of a gas turboset . This size depends on a large number of different parameters, such as inter alia nozzle geometry, atomization pressure or the flow conditions following atomization. These parameters are subject to potential changes in long-term operation: erosive or blocking of atomizer nozzles are only some of the processes which can change the atomization characteristics of an injection apparatus in the long term,<br><br>
US 2001/002078 and WO 2004/025102 have disclosed methods in which a mass flow of liquid is injected in atomized form into the air intake duct of an engine. The injection is operated in a closed control circuit by means of sensors arranged downstream of the injection, and the injected mass flow is adjusted until a desired value for the measured values is reached. The variables measured in this case, however, also do not provide any information as to the atomization characteristics.<br><br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The invention seeks to remedy this problem. The invention characterized in the claims is based on the obj ect of providing a method of the type described in the introduction which is able to avoid the drawbacks of the prior art. In particular, it is intended to avoid potentially negative effects of a deviation in the liquid injection from its design point.<br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved using the combination of features of claim 1.<br>
Therefore, the core concept of the invention is for the injection of liquid to be operated in a closed control circuit, with a property of the spray which is generated, for example its drop size or drop size range, being used as a guide variable. Accordingly, the core concept of the invention is to record significant parameters, i.e. primarily the drop size or the drop size range and/or the drop concentration of the liquid mist which is generated, by metrology, and to input the measured values obtained in this way into the operating control of the liquid injection, in order thereby to perform, for example, protective actions in the event of limit values being exceeded or adjusting actual values of the measured parameters to desired values or into desired values ranges. It is highly advantageous to define a tolerance band around the desired value. Defining a tolerance band around the desired value or alternatively a control dead band around a current value prevents the closed control circuit realized in this way from reacting excessively sensitively, which otherwise constitutes a potential source of control circuit instabilities. The desired value or the desired value range may in this case be defined so as to be variable, in the sense that the desired values or desired value ranges are defined,  for example, as a<br><br>
function of the current engine operating state. In one embodiment of the method according to the invention, the drop size and optionally the concentration distribution are recorded as a function of the mass flow of liquid injected at a reference instant, in particular in the new state of the injection apparatus, and defined as desired values. An actual value/desired value deviation in, for example, the drop size which exceeds a certain magnitude then can be used as a measure of the wear.<br>
Operating control of the injection apparatus is generally present in any case in order to control its operating parameters, such as for example the mass flow injected or the atomization admission pressure, and/or to keep them within a predetermined desired band.<br>
It will be automatically understood that the measurement location in or on the intake duct must be arranged downstream of the atomization apparatus.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, measured values are recorded at a plurality of locations of the intake duct, in particular over its cross section. In a further embodiment, integrating measurement methods, which deliver mean values over a certain measurement field, are used. By way of example, transmitted light techniques are used to determine mean values over the trans illuminated zone. In this case too, it is once again possible for measurements to be recorded at a plurality of locations and at different angles simultaneously and for the local distribution to be reconstructed by means of tomographic methods.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention which is particularly suitable when using pressure atomizers, the atomization admission pressure of the liquid is altered as a function of the measured values, and in particular the admission pressure is increased in the event of a<br><br>
negative desired value/actual value deviation in the drop size and the admission pressure is reduced in the event  of  a  positive  desired  value/actual  value deviation  in  the  drop  size.  In  this  context,  the desired value/actual  value  deviation  is  defined by subtracting the actual value from the desired value; accordingly,  a  negative  desired  value/actual  value deviation or control deviation means that the actual value of the drop size is greater than the desired value,  and  a  positive  desired  value/actual  value deviation or control deviation means that the actual value is lower than the desired value.  The control action    described    therefore    involves    either simultaneously altering the mass flow of the atomized liquid or having to alter the geometry or number of atomizer nozzles  in order  to keep  this  mass  flow constant. Therefore, on the one hand, in the event of a negative  control  deviation  in  the  drop  size,  the passage cross section of the atomizer nozzles can be reduced in size, and in the event of a positive control deviation in the drop size the passage cross section of the atomizer nozzles can be increased in size.  The passage cross section can be altered, for example, by conical  inner  bodies  being  introduced  a  different distance into the atomizer opening. The effect can also be  achieved by nozzles  and/or  nozzle  groups  being selectively switched on or off, in such a manner that in the event of a negative control deviation in the drop size nozzles and/or nozzle groups are switched off,  and  conversely  in  the  event  of  a  positive deviation in the drop size nozzles and/or nozzle groups are selectively switched on. In another embodiment of the invention, the apparatus which is used to inject the  drops  has  nozzles  and/or  nozzle  groups  with different atomization properties, in such a manner that some of the nozzles are intended for finer atomization and others of the nozzles are intended for less fine atomization; in this case, the diameter of the drops<br><br>
can be kept within a desired value range or within a tolerance band around a desired value by switching between the nozzles and/or nozzle groups.<br>
The selected switching between nozzles and/or nozzle groups can of course also take place in other ways. If the measurement of the drop size and in particular of the drop concentration takes place at different points in the intake duct, it is possible for nozzles and/or nozzle groups arranged at different locations over the cross section of the intake duct to be switched on and/or off in order to achieve a predetermined concentration profile, in particular an approximately even distribution of drop size and drop concentration over the cross section of the intake duct.<br>
When using atomizers with auxiliary media, in particular air-assisted atomizers, it is possible, without significantly affecting the mass flow of liquid, to vary the size of the atomized drops by varying the pressure of the auxiliary medium, so as to adjust it to the desired value.<br>
Another way of controlling the drop size consists in admixing additives which influence the surface tension to the liquid that is to be atomized. Therefore, if the liquid to be atomized is water, it is possible for example to reduce the surface tension by adding soap-like additives. Therefore, to achieve smaller drops in the event of an actual value of the drop size which is higher than the desired value, it is possible to simply increase the quantity of the additive which lowers the surface tension that is metered in, and vice versa.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the injection of liquid is switched off in the event of a certain drop size being exceeded or in the event of a certain deviation in the concentration profile from the<br><br>
desired profile being exceeded. If the specified data can no longer be complied with, this means that there is a latent risk to the engine, for example a turbo-compressor of a gas turboset arranged downstream, and there is a clear indication of damage or excess wear to the injection apparatus, for example on account of erosion to the injection nozzles. The control will therefore be operated as a safety device or what is known as a limit controller.<br>
Optical methods have proven to be particularly suitable measurement methods for carrying out the method according to the invention, it is in this case possible to use both transmitted light and scattered light measurement methods. Scattered light measurement methods which record scattered light near the upstream direction have proven particularly suitable. By way of example, a particle size measuring appliance with which the person skilled in the art will be in any case familiar, for example in the style of the commercially available Malvern Particle Sizer, can be used. A multi-wavelength extinction method which is inexpensive to implement, can also advantageously be used; such a method, given a suitable design, is able to determine at least the drop concentration and drop size as well as the distribution range of the drop size. Furthermore, it is possible to use image evaluation methods which allow a locally resolving measurement for example as stereoscopic video images or with position-selective illumination.<br>
Transmitted light measurement methods, for example, generally deliver mean values over the entire transilluminated zone. It is in this case also possible to reconstruct a local resolution by using tomographic methods.<br><br>
Further advantageous embodiments of the invention will emerge in light of the subclaims and the exemplary embodiments described below.<br>
Brief description of the drawing<br>
The invention is explained in more detail below on the<br>
basis  of  exemplary  embodiments  illustrated  in  the<br>
drawing, in which, in detail:<br>
Figure 1 shows a gas turboset which can be operated in<br>
accordance with the invention;<br>
Figures 2 to 5 show examples of control circuits which<br>
can be implemented in accordance with the invention.<br>
Components which are not directly necessary have been omitted, in order to facilitate gaining an understanding   of   the   invention.   The   exemplary<br>
embodiments are to be understood as purely instructive and are not to be used to restrict the invention as characterized in the claims.<br>
Way of carrying out the invention<br>
In accordance with Figure 1, a gas turboset 1 comprises a compressor 2, a combustion chamber 3 and a turbine 4. A useful power is used to drive a load, for example generator 5, for example via a shaft (indicated without a reference number). The compressor 2 draws air out of the environment, and this air is compressed and passed into the combustion chamber 3, where a compressed hot gas is generated, which is then expanded in a work-performing manner in the turbine 4. Gas turbines and other air-breathing engines are in many applications equipped with special intake paths which allow a defined location for the air inlet to be selected and the intake air to be suitably prepared. The gas turboset illustrated in Figure 1 has an intake duct 6, through which the intake air flows, upstream of the<br><br>
compressor  inlet.  This  intake  duct  comprises  inlet lamellae 7,  the purpose of which is to prevent the ingress of coarse dirt, in particular rainwater. This is followed downstream by an air filter 8 and a muffler 9. An injection apparatus 10, which can be used to inject a liquid, for example water,  in the form of a fine  spray mist  into the  intake  duct,  is  arranged downstream of the muffler 9. The drops of water which have been introduced in some cases,  depending on the arrangement of the injection apparatus and the humidity of the intake air, evaporate upstream of the compressor and therefore cool the intake air, which leads to an increase  in  the  air  density  and,  given  otherwise constant conditions, an increase in the air mass flow in the gas turboset. If a very large amount of liquid is  injected,  drops  of  water  penetrate  into  the compressor,   evaporate  during  the  compression  and thereby  effect  intensive  internal  cooling  of  the compressor,  with positive effects on the performance data  of  the  gas  turboset.  As  mentioned  in  the introduction, when using this method it is important to achieve fine atomization and a uniform distribution of the liquid mist in the intake duct.  It is of great importance  in particular  to  ensure  the  quality of atomization, since as the drop size increases the flow following  capacity of  the  drops  decreases  and the potential erosive action on the compressor components increases. It is therefore desirable to verify that the drop diameter is below a permissible maximum value by means of an operating measurement, and if appropriate to use  control  actions  to  act  on  the  atomization accordingly.  On  the  other  hand,  excessively  fine atomization  entails  very  high  levels  of  energy consumption, and especially if pressure atomizers are used, the erosive action of the liquid on the atomizer nozzles  increases  as  the  drop  diameter  decreases. Moreover, the drop size has a crucial influence on the atomization rate and therefore the depth of penetration<br><br>
of a drop into the compressor. For these reasons, it is desirable for the drop size, expediently also as a mean value, or the drop size range to be recorded in real time and to effect control to a desired value range. If appropriate, it may also be important to record the distribution of the drop concentration over the cross section of the flow duct and to set it to a predetermined desired concentration profile, for example an even distribution. The injection apparatus 10 is supplied with liquid by a pump 11. The mass flow of liquid is distributed between different nozzles and/or nozzle groups of the inj ection apparatus by means of shut-off and/or throttling members 12, 13, 14. A control unit 15 is used to control operation of the injection apparatus. In the simplest operating method, which is familiar from the prior art, the control unit 15 receive one or more control variables X from the control device, which is not illustrated and is also not relevant to the invention, of the gas turboset, and calculates control variables YP and Yv for actuating the pump 11 and/or the shut-off and/or throttling members 12, 13, 14 in such a way that the system is operating in an open control loop. In a first further development, the system comprises a mass flow measurement location 2 0 and pressure measurement locations 21, which delivers feedback of the mass flow<br>
m and the pressure p, preferably the atomization admission pressure. Although feedback of this nature can be used to adjust mass flow and pressures in a closed control circuit to desired values, it is not possible to make a direct statement as to the drop size and drop concentration. According to the invention, therefore, there is a measuring apparatus for determining the drop size and/or the drop concentration. In the exemplary embodiment, this apparatus comprises a light source 16, a receiver 18 and an evaluation unit 19. Originating from the light source 16, a measurement beam 17 radiates through the<br><br>
flow duct containing the liquid mist. Optical access is realized by windows 22. The light is scattered by the liquid mist and absorbed, to a negligible degree in the case  of  water and visible  light.  The  receiver  18 records  the  transmitted  residual  intensity  and/or scattered light,  preferably at different angles.  If sufficient measured values are recorded, it is possible to determine the drop size D, at least as a mean value, and gradually also the concentration C of the drops in the evaluation unit 19 from the measurement signals. The person skilled in the art will be familiar with optical measurement methods of this type, for example the  Malvern measuring appliance  or multi-wavelength extinction  measurements,  which  if  appropriate  also allow  information  to  be  ascertained  as  to  the distribution width of the drop size range. It is also readily possible for the receiver or a plurality of receivers 18 not to be arranged coaxial ly with the light source or with a plurality of light sources 16 and the measurement beam, in which case only scattered light  at  certain angles  is  recorded.  If  sufficient measurement signals are recorded,  it is possible to calculate the drop size D and/or the drop concentration C  from  the  measured  intensity  values  I  in  the evaluation unit  19.  Other methods  familiar to the person skilled in the art as well as scattered and/or transmitted light measurement methods can also be used to determine the drop size and/or drop concentration. These variables are then passed onto the control unit 15, which compares the values determined in this way, i.e. primarily the drop size and/or drop concentration at a measurement position, but if appropriate also a measured drop size range and/or the distribution of the drop size and/or the concentration over a cross section of the flow duct, with desired values or desired value ranges, and if appropriate carries out suitable control actions to bring the measured actual values back into line with the desired values. In this case,  the drop<br><br>
size can preferably be set, in the case of air-assisted<br>
atomizers or atomizers which work with other auxiliary<br>
media, by varying the pressure of the auxiliary medium,<br>
i.e. for example the atomizer air pressure.<br>
In the case of pressure atomizers,  the drop size is<br>
determined  primarily  by  the  atomization  admission<br>
pressure. Varying this admission pressure without at<br>
the same time altering the mass flow of the liquid<br>
requires the total free cross section of flow of the<br>
injection nozzles to be varied. One way of doing this<br>
is for individual nozzles and/or groups of nozzles to<br>
be  selectively  switched  on  and/or  off.  This  is<br>
illustrated in Figure 2. In accordance with Figure 2,<br>
an injection apparatus 10, which comprises a number of<br>
nozzle tubes (of which nozzle tubes 211, 212, 213 are<br>
illustrated)  is arranged in an intake duct  6.  The<br>
nozzle tubes can be supplied with liquid independently<br>
of one another by means of shut-off and/or throttling<br>
members 12, 13, 14; the liquid is delivered by a pump<br>
11.  It will be clearly understood that it is also<br>
possible for a number of nozzle tubes to be combined to<br>
form a group and to be actuated jointly by means of a<br>
common shut-off and/or throttling member. The direction<br>
of flow through the duct 6 is indicated by arrows<br>
without any reference numerals. A droplet mist  (not<br>
shown) is formed downstream of the injection apparatus<br>
10. The duct 6 has metrology access points,  in this<br>
case windows 22, which are arranged downstream of the<br>
injection  apparatus  and  which  provide  access  for<br>
preferably  optical  measurements  171,  172.  In  one<br>
embodiment, the metrology access points are arranged a<br>
distance of at  least two to three duct transverse<br>
dimensions downstream of the inj ection apparatus,  so<br>
that the spray mist has reached a steady state. The<br>
arrangement illustrated also enables measured values to<br>
be  obtained at  a plurality of  locations  over  the<br>
transverse extent of the flow duct.  Measured value<br>
pick-ups 181 and 182 record the measurement data, which<br><br>
are forwarded to evaluation units 191 and 192 which calculate, for example, a drop size in a measurement volume  from  the  simple  measurement  signals.  If  a suitable measurement technique is used,  it  is also possible to calculate the concentration or at least a relative concentration. The size and position of the measurement volume are in this case entirely dependent on  the  measurement  method  used;  transmitted  light techniques as integrating measurement methods form, for example, mean values over the entire transilluminated region,  whereas scattered light methods tend toward punctiform measurement.  Image evaluation methods can also be used to realize both integral and spatially resolved measurements.  It will be clear that in the example illustrated measured values can be recorded at a plurality of positions I, II over the cross section of the flow duct. The data calculated in the evaluation units are passed onto the control unit 15.  If,  for example, it is established that the drop diameter is outside the desired value range, control actions are initiated.  If  the measured drop size  is  above the desired value, at least one of the shut-off members 12, 13, 14 is closed, while in a further control circuit, comprising  the pump  II,  the mass  flow measurement location 2 0 and the control unit 15, the mass flow in the now smaller cross section of  flow through the injection  apparatus  is  constantly  adjusted  to  the desired value. In this case, of course, the atomization admission pressure rises, and therefore smaller drops are produced. If, on the other hand, the drop size is below the desired value range, additional nozzle groups are taken into operation,  with the result that the atomization  admission pressure drops.  This prevents excessive erosion of the nozzles and excessive loading of the pump 11. Another option would also be to switch between nozzle groups which have nozzles which,  for example on account of the different diameters,  are intended  to  generate  different  sizes  of  drops.<br><br>
Therefore, by selectively choosing the nozzles and/or nozzle groups which are in operation, it is possible to ensure that, for example, drops of equal size are present in the same concentration at all measurement positions, or it is possible to change to a different desired value for the distribution of drop size and concentration over the cross section of the flow duct in the closed control circuit. For example, to alter the drop size it is possible for nozzles and/or nozzle groups to be switched on and/or off in the manner which has been described, and the injection site can if appropriate be displaced to a location where a comparatively low concentration of the drops has been measured. It is also possible for nozzles and/or nozzle groups which are intended to generate sprays of differing fineness and can be actuated separately to be arranged in the injection apparatus. The generation of sprays of different fineness, given the same admission pressure, can be effected in a particularly simple way by using different nozzle geometries. By way of example, the nozzles on the tubes 211, 212, 213 could be provided for different drop sizes, in such a way that switching between the nozzle tubes varies the drop size.<br>
The text which follows presents a number of preferred ways of controlling the drop size. In accordance with Figure 3, a mass flow of liquid that is to be atomized is fed to a pressure atomizer nozzle 25 via a feedline 23 . A mass flow measurement position 20 is used to<br>
determine the mass flow m , which is processed by the control unit 15 and adjusted to a desired value by control actions on the pump 11 and the shut-off and throttling member 12. A spray mist 2 4 forms downstream of the nozzle opening. A measurement pick-up 18 and an evaluation unit 19 record the drop size at a suitable position within the spray mist. The drop size D is likewise passed onto the control unit 15, where the<br><br>
measured actual value is compared with a desired value or a desired value range. A control variable Yi is formed as a function of the control deviation and is used, by way of an actuator (not shown) , to make a conical inner body 26 of the nozzle move axially, either by passing further into the nozzle opening or moving back so as to open up a larger cross section. In particular, if the actual value of the drop size exceeds the desired value or the desired value range, the inner body 26 is moved further into the nozzle opening, to the position indicated in dashed lines, in order to obtain a finer aerosol, and conversely it is moved further out of the nozzle opening to increase the actual value of the drop size.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates the control of an atomizer nozzle which is assisted by auxiliary media, in particular an air-assisted atomizer nozzle. In the example illustrated, the liquid that is to be atomized is passed through a liquid tube 27 at relatively low pressure and forms liquid jets or large drops 2 8 at the opening. An atomizer gas flow 30, which atomizes the jets 2 8 to form a liquid mist 24, is passed through a cladding tube 29. One significant advantage of this design of nozzle is that the mass flow of liquid can be set independently of the drop size, which is primarily determined by the velocity of the atomizer gas. The liquid is supplied via the feedline 23 . A mass flow measurement location 20, the pump 11 and the shut-of f and throttling member 12 together with the control unit 15 form a control circuit for controlling the mass flow of liquid. The atomizer gas is supplied via the line 31, and its admission pressure, and therefore the velocity of the atomizer gas flow, can be set by means of the throttling member 32. A measurement pick-up 18 and analysis unit 19 once again determine the drop size D of the aerosol, which in the control unit 15 is compared with the desired values. A control variable YL<br><br>
which acts on the throttling member 32 is formed as a function of the control deviation. In particular, if the actual drop size is larger than the desired value, the throttling member is opened further, with the result that the admission pressure of the atomizer gas is increased, and conversely it is closed if the actual value of the measured drop size is smaller than the desired value. In this way, the drop size which is generated in the closed control circuit is also controlled.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, illustrated in Figure 5, the drop size or drop size range is altered by a quantity of an additive which alters the surface tension of the liquid that is to be atomized being deliberately admixed into the liquid feedline from a tank 33 . By way of example, a quantity of a detergent can be deliberately admixed to water that is to be atomized, in order to reduce the surface tension and therefore to obtain smaller drops. The additive is delivered via the pump 34, and the mass flow is controlled by the control element 35. A measurement pick-up 18 and an analysis unit 19 determine the drop size D in the flow duct. Control unit 15 compares actual value and desired value of the drop size and depending on the control deviation forms the control variable YD, which acts on the throttling member 3 5 and therefore controls the admixing of additive. In this case, this control takes place in such a way that if the drop size actual value is above the desired value, the surface tension is reduced, and if the actual value is below the desired value, the surface tension is increased.<br>
A common factor in all the exemplary embodiments presented above is that the liquid injection is operated with at least one measured property of the<br><br>
spray that is generated, in particular the drop size, as a guide variable in the closed control circuit.<br>
In light of the exemplary embodiments presented above, further possible embodiments of the invention which are also covered by the scope of the patent claims will also readily become apparent to the person skilled in the art. In particular, the invention is not restricted to being used in gas turbosets. Image evaluation methods which likewise allow a local resolution by the application of stereoscopy or selective illumination of certain regions, are also suitable for use as the measurement method.<br>
The invention may also be useful per se even if no liquid or only a limited quantity of liquid drops is to penetrate into the engine, for example the compressor of a gas turboset. The measurement apparatus is then advantageously arranged only a small distance upstream of the inlet, and the drop concentration is measured. If this concentration exceeds a limit value, the inj ected mass flow is reduced.<br><br>
