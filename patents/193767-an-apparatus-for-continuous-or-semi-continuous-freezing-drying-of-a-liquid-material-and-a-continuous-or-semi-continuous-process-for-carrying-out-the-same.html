The  present  invention  relates  to  an  apparatus  for continuous   or  semi-continuous  freezing-drying  of  a  liquid material  and  a  continuous  or  semi-continuous  process  for  carrying out  the  same     This  process  is  particularly  advantageous  for freeze-drying  pharmaceutical  products.     The  invention  also<br>
includes  the  lyophilised  products  produced  by  the  process.<br>
Freeze-drying or lyophilisation, is used generally to increase the stability and hence storage life of materials. As such it is particularly useful where a material is known to be unstable or less stable in aqueous solution, as is often  the  case  with  pharmaceutical  materials.<br>
In its simplest form freeze-drying consists of freezing the aqueous material in a vial and then subjecting the  material  to  a  vacuum  and  drying.<br>
The conventional method of freeze-drying is to load<br>
magazines full of vials onto chilled shelves in a sealed<br>
freeze-drying    chamber.	The    shelf    temperature     is     then<br>
reduced to freeze the product. At the end of the freezing period, the aqueous material is frozen as a plug at the bottom of the vial. The pressure in the chamber is then reduced and simultaneously the shelves are heated thereby causing the frozen water to sublime leaving a freeze-dried plug in the bottom of the vial (Figure 4A) . The whole lyophilisation cycle normally can take 20 to 60 hours, depending  on  the  product  and  size  of  vial.<br>
The disadvantages of this conventional method are as follows:<br>
a)        the  time  taken  to  freeze-dry  a  product;<br><br><br>
b)	the   freeze-drying  process  is  batch  rather  than continuous;<br>
c)	except in very sophisticated automated installations, there must necessarily be human operators to load the trays of vials into the freeze-drying chamber, which leaves  the  product  open  to  contamination;<br>
d)	the process is energy intensive when the power consumption  of  the  clean  room  is  taken  into  account;<br>
e)	the freeze-drying apparatus is very expensive and takes up a large area of space, which is necessarily very expensive because it must be maintained clean or sterile  to  a  high  standard;   and<br>
f)	the vials are subjected to a number of discontinuous handling operations such as high-speed in line filling, transfer to holding tables, and transfer to and  from  trays.<br>
These   operations   risk   vial   damage   or   contamination, create   particles   in   the   clean   area,    and   require   operator supervision.<br>
European patent EP-A-0048194 discloses a method of "shell-freezing" material such that the resulting lyophilised product forms a relatively thin coat or "shell" in the vial. In this method, the aqueous material is placed a vial which is then rotated slowly on its side in a freezing bath. The shell-frozen product is then loaded into a conventional lyophilisation chamber and dried over a six  hour  cycle   (page  7} .<br>
However, although this method allegedly results in a "shell frozen" material, distribution can be non-uniform. Also    relatively    long    lyophilisation    times    may    still     be<br><br>
required.     The  above  rolling  method  also  suffers   from  other<br>
disadvantages,    including:<br>
a)	it   limits   the   amount   of   liquid   that   can   be   placed   in<br>
the  vial  since  above  a  certain  limit   some   liquid  would<br>
pour  out; b}        there   is   a   risk   of   spillage   in   any   event   during   the<br>
rolling  process;<br>
c)	rolling       in      a      liquid       coolant       may      result       in contamination  by  the  coolant;<br>
d)	such   a   rolling   process   may   result   in   a   less   uniform shell   (giving  a  longer  drying  time);   and<br>
e)	a  rolling  process  may  result   in  a  longer  freezing  time (compared  to  the  present  invention).<br>
U.S. Patent No. 3952541 describes an apparatus for a freezing aqueous solution or suspension which comprises a refrigerated tank which has at least one plate, which carries the materials to be frozen, mounted on a shaft to rotate at about 10 to 20 revolutions per minute around the base of the tank. The tank is adjustable to tilt at {for example) a 45° angle, and a fan mounted inside the roof of the tank blows cold air around the refrigerated tank. Once the product is frozen, it appears that the vials would have to be transferred to a separate drying chamber, for approximately IIM hours. The whole lyophilisation cycle takes 12 hours and the product obtained is of an internally concave  parabolic  form.<br>
The disadvantages of this process is that the time is still long (12 hours), the process must be operated batchwise and it is not capable of handling a large throughput of vials. Furthermore, when transferring the frozen  open  product   from  the   refrigerated  tank   to   a  drying<br><br>
chamber, there must apparently be human operator contact and the product must be maintained in a frozen stage until transferred.<br>
British patent no. 784784 discloses a freeze-drying process in which vessels containing liquid material are subjected to a centrifugal force at a low vacuum. The low vacuum causes the water to be released and the effect of centrifuging helps suppress the formation of bubbles and froth as the liquid boils under reduced pressure. Both this step and the drying step involve subjecting the vessel to traumatic operations which can cause particles in the clean  area  of  the  process,   and  disrupt  the     final  product.<br>
Further freeze-drying processes are described in British patent nos. 1199285 and 1370683, and U.S. patent no.   3769717.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to obviate or mitigate  at   least  some  of  the  aforesaid  disadvantages.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to provide a lyophilisation process and apparatus with shorter cycle times  than  the  aforementioned  prior  process  and  apparatus.<br>
It is yet a further object of the invention to provide lyophilisation apparatus which can be housed in a smaller space than the conventional freeze-drying apparatus and preferably also negates the need for human operator contact at critical parts of the process so as to minimize human contamination  of   the  product.<br>
According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a process for carrying out freeze-drying which includes a freezing step of rotating about the longitudinal axis the vessel containing the liquid material to   be   freeze-dried  at   a   speed   not   less   than   that   required<br><br>
to maintain the liquid in a shell of substantially uniform thickness against the inner walls of the vessel by the action of centrifugal force while subjecting the liquid material to freezing conditions sufficient to freeze the liquid  material   into  the  form  of  said  shell.<br>
Preferably the vials are rotated about their axes while held in the substantially horizontal position. This aids the achievement of an even distribution of liquid around  the   interior  of  the  vessel.<br>
The apparatus for carrying out the process of the first aspect of the invention, forms the second aspect of the invention. Accordingly there is provided apparatus for quick freezing of a liquid material contained in a sterilised vessel for subsequent drying in such a manner that said liquid material forms a shell of substantially uniform thickness on the inner walls of said vessel; said apparatus comprising: rotatable gripping means for holding the vessel and rotating it about its longitudinal axis and capable of rotating at high speeds so as to maintain the liquid material against the inner walls of the vessel by centrifugal force; filling means for introducing the liquid material into the vessel; freezing means for freezing the liquid in the form of a shell of substantially uniform thickness against the inner walls of the vessel; and conveying means to move the next vessel or vessels into position  for  filling  and  freezing.<br>
By gripping means we mean a means to hold the vessel steadfast  while   it   is   rotated  about   its   longitudinal   axis.<br>
Preferably the liquid material is aqueous. By aqueous material we mean aqueous solutions, suspension or the like preferably   of   pharmaceutical   products   such   as   antibiotics<br><br>
vaccine, organic chemical drugs, enzymes or serum. The invention, however, can be used for freeze-drying material dissolved  or  suspended  in  a  solvent  other  than  water,<br>
By substantially uniform thickness of shell we mean whereby the thickness varies less than about 5% of the average thickness from the upper to the lower and of the vessel. By this we mean to include the average thickness of the shell measured at the mid-point between any local peaks or troughs in the shell surface caused by e.g. fluid dynamic interactions between the liquid and freezing gas during  the  freezing  process.<br>
The invention (of the first and second aspects) can be<br>
applied to large vessels of  material, but preferably<br>
the vessels are vials or other such small vessels, such as<br>
about 10 to 40 mm in diameter and a plurality of these<br>
vials are filled and frozen simultaneously. This is the<br>
type of vessel used in the pharmaceutical industry to carry<br>
at     least     one     unit     dose     of     drug.	The     drug     is     then<br>
reconstituted with water before administering to the patient.<br>
The uniformity of the shell thickness is a function of the angle of the vessel and the speed of rotation. It is preferable to rotate the vessel up to about 45o off the horizontal, most preferably in a substantially horizontal position.<br>
When the liquid material is introduced to the vessel while it is simultaneously rotating substantially about the horizontal (or up to about 45° off the horizontal), a shell frozen product is obtained with substantially no frozen product on the base of the vessel. This appears to be the first   time   that   this   type   of   shell   has   been   achieved,   and<br><br>
it forms a third aspect of the invention. All shell dried product obtainable by the process and apparatus of the inventions  also  form  this   further  aspect  of  the   invention.<br>
The speed of rotation of the vessel should be controlled to maintain the liquid material in a shell on the inner walls of the vessel by the action of centrifugal force. If the speed of rotation is too low the liquid material will not be held as a shell on the walls of the vessel. The speed of rotation is a design consideration depending on the density of the liquid material to be frozen and the size of the vessel and preferably about 2500 to 3500 revolutions per minute. Typically it will be about 3000 revolutions per minute for a vial of about 10 to 40 mm diameter.<br>
It has also been found that if the liquid material is advantageously introduced into the vessel while it is simultaneously rotating at an angle at or near the horizontal, then a greater quantity of material can be introduced. That is, if a greater than the normal "fill" quantity of material is introduced when the vessel is stationary and horizontal, some material will run out. This is less likely to happen if the vessel is simultaneously  rotating  when   it   is   filled.<br>
The liquid material is frozen into the form of a shell by subjecting it to freezing conditions. In one preferred embodiment of the invention this is achieved by injecting a controlled flow of freezing inert gas such as nitrogen into the vessel while it is simultaneously rotating the vessel. The flow of freezing gas is controlled in the sense that if injected at too high a pressure it may disrupt the shell of aqueous  material  or  may  cause  it  to  overflow.<br><br>
Injecting freezing gas into the interior of the<br>
rotating vessel has the advantage of speeding up the<br>
freezing     step.	Freezing     gas     could     also,      however,      be<br>
circulated around the outside of the vessel, but with such a process it is important to minimise the points of contact between the gripping means and outer walls of the vessel so as to minimise any insulation of the liquid material by such  contact.<br>
The method of the present invention readily lends itself to incorporation in a continuous or semi-continuous freeze drying process. In such a process the vessels are held in racks or magazines and are moved automatically through the various stages up to and including being subjected  to   the  vacuum  drying  conditions.<br>
A process for carrying out freeze-drying according to the first aspect of the invention includes a freezing  step,   said  process  including  the  following  steps:<br>
a)	loading  one  or  more  racks  or  magazines  with  the vessels   to  be  filled;<br>
b)	washing  the  vessels,   and  racks  or  magazines;<br>
c)	sterilising  the  vessels,   and  racks  or  magazines;<br>
d)	filling  the  vessel  with  the  liquid  material  to  be frozen;<br>
e)	freezing   the   liquid  material   according   to   the   first aspect  of  the  invention;<br><br>
f)	subjecting  the  vessels  containing  the   frozen  material to  vacuum  conditions;<br>
g)	drying   the   frozen  material;<br>
h)        plugging  the  vessels;   and<br>
i)        unloading  the  vessel  and  optionally  capping  and labelling  the  vessels.<br>
In   steps   a)    to   c)    and   optionally   in   steps   f}    to   h} ,<br>
the  vessels  can  optionally    be  held  in  an  inverted  position<br>
e.g.     in    the    racks    or    magazines.	The    vessels    must    be<br>
inverted in step b) so that washing water will drain. Furthermore, in a preferred embodiment of the invention where the vessels are held by the base and gas injected in through their open necks, then having the vessels already inverted  at  step  c)   saves  an  additional  handling  step.<br>
It will be readily appreciated that the vessels could be  unloaded  prior   to  plugging.<br>
A fourth aspect of the invention relates to the process for drying a shell dried material, and the fifth aspect relates to the apparatus for carrying out this drying  operation.<br>
Accordingly in a fourth aspect of the invention there is provided a process for freeze-drying a liquid material frozen in the form of a shell on the inner walls of the body of a vessel, which includes the drying step of applying heat for a time interval radially inwardly from a heating means to the shell in a vacuum chamber over substantially the whole surface area of the shell so as to dry  the   shell   frozen  material.<br><br>
In a fifth aspect of the invention there is provided apparatus for drying a liquid material frozen in the form of a shell on the inner walls of the body of a vessel, said apparatus  comprising:<br>
a  vacuum  chamber,<br>
heating means within the vacuum chamber designed to direct heat radially inwardly from the heating means to the shell frozen material, and conveying means to convey the vessel   through  the  vacuum  chamber.<br>
The advantage of heating the vessel radially inwards<br>
from the heating means is that the drying cycle time is<br>
greatly reduced as compared with conventionally drying<br>
methods. Here the base of the vessel is heated, such as on<br>
a heated shelf, and the heat transfer is axially upwards<br>
through    the    glass    walls    of    the    vessel.	This    causes    a<br>
temperature differential along the length of the vessel walls, thereby causing a 'drying front' in the shell frozen material. As a result the drying cycle time is typically 30 hours for plug-frozen material compared to a drying cycle  time  in  accordance  with  the   invention  of  3   hours.<br>
Preferably  the  heating  means   is   in  close   proximity  to<br>
the  wall  of  the  vessel,   such  as   5mm  or  less,   advantageously<br>
3   mm   or   less.       In   a   preferred   embodiment   of   the   invention<br>
(heating    blocks)      the    distance    between    the    wall     of     the<br>
vessel  and  the  heating  means  is  about  1mm.<br>
Preferably also the heating means extends round<br>
substantially the whole circumference of the vessel, and<br>
advantageously also extends substantially to the same<br>
height      as      the      shell.	In      a     particularly     preferred<br>
embodiment the heating means includes a heating chamber into  which  the  vessel   is  received.<br><br>
since the drying time is greatly reduced, the throughput of the vacuum drier is increased. Therefore a similar production capacity can be achieved with a much smaller  vacuum  drier  than  that  used  conventionally.<br>
It will be appreciated that although the first, second or the fourth and fifth aspects of the invention can be used independently with conventional freezing or drying apparatus, it is advantageous to use them together. Thus as a consequence of the decreased freezing time achieved by the first and second aspects of the invention together with the decreased drying time of the fourth and fifth aspects of the invention, the production capacity of the conventional freeze-drying apparatus can be achieved with much smaller apparatus according to the invention. In fact the apparatus of the invention can be mobile, whereas conventional freeze-drying apparatus is much too large and bulky to be mobile. With all the aspects of the invention used together, an automated continuous or semi-continuous process can also be designed with minimal or no human operator contact. In this respect the conveying means is preferably the arrangement of rollers described hereafter. The magazine is also preferably of the design defined in the  sixth  aspect  of  the   invention<br>
Accordingly in a sixth aspect of the invention there is provided a magazine comprising a magazine comprising a tray having an upper and lower surface and having equipage location apertures extending through the tray for locating the necks of the vials, each set of at least three locating apertures defining an area therebetween in which an air flow aperture has been cut away, and one or more    abutments    adjacent    each    aperture    which    trace    the<br><br>
circumference of the base of a vessel about the vertical axis of the locating aperture to form a locating flange on which the vessel can be located in the upright position.<br>
Preferably the location apertures are arranged in rows and columns and each set of four location apertures define substantially the comers of a square, in which an airflow aperture is provided.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an apparatus for continuous or semi-continuous freezing-drying of a liquid material contained in a sterilised vessel in such a manner that said liquid material forms a shell of substantially uniform thickness on the inner walls of said vessel and in which vessels loaded at one end of the process moved automatically through the various stages up to and including being subjected to vacuum drying conditions; characterised in that said apparatus consists of: racks or magazines which have individual locations for locating vessels such that they are held apart; a washer for washing and steriliser for sterilising the vessels and racks or magazines; rotatabiy gripping means for removing the vessels and returning the vessels to the racks or magazines, and for holding a vessel and rotating said vessel about its longitudinal axis at a high speed so as to maintain the liquid material against the inner walls of the vessel by centrifugal force; filling means for introducing the liquid material into the vessel; freezing means for freezing the liquid in the form of a shell of substantially uniform thickness against the inner walls of the vessel; a vacuum drying chamber containing heating means; and conveying means to move magazines or racks holding the vessels containing the frozen material into and through the vacuum drying chamber, and to move subsequent racks or magazines loaded with vessels into position for filling and freezing.<br><br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention also provides a continuous or semi-continuous process for carrying out freeze drying of liquid material in a vessel in the apparatus as claimed in claim 1 in which vessels are loaded at one end of the process and moved automatically through the various stages up to and including being subjected to vacuum drying conditions, characterised in that, the process consists of the steps of: (a) loading racks or magazines with vessels to be filled, such that said vessels are held apart in individual locations in the racks or magazines; (b) washing the vessels and racks or magazines said vessels being in the inverted position so that washing water will drain therefrom; (c) sterilising the vessels and racks or magazines; (d) filling the vessels with the liquid material to be frozen; (e) rotating the vessels containing the liquid material to be frozen at a speed not less than that required to maintain the liquid in a shell of substantially uniform thickness against the inner walls of the vessel by the action of centrifugal force while subjecting the liquid to freezing conditions sufficient to freeze the material into the form of said shell wherein vessels are removed from the racks or magazines and are rotated remote from the racks or magazines and after a preset time to complete freezing, the rotation is stopped and the vessels are returned to the racks or magazines; and (f) moving the rack or magazine with the vessels containing the frozen material held at individual locations into and through a vacuum drying chamber to dry  <br><br>

Referring to the process of Figures 1 and 2, the steps of an embodiment of the process and apparatus of the invention  are  as   follows  below.<br>
Loading step (A): Vials (1) are loaded upside-down into a magazine (2) , such that the neck of each vial locates in an aperture (3) of the magazine (2). This loading step (A) takes place in a non-sterile environment and the vials (1) can be manually or automatically loaded. The vial (1) are carried through the whole process in the magazine (2), which is in turn carried through the process Qn conveyor means in the form of roller conveyors (not Shown in Figures 1 and 2, but shown in Figure 7). This is (different from prior freeze-drying processes where the vials are placed loosely on metal trays. The specifically designed magazines (2) aired shown more particularly in Figures   5   to   7.<br>
Washing step (B) and Sterilising step (C) : The vials (1) are then washed both inside and outside by injecting Washing solution into the inverted vials (1) through their necks and spraying washing solution onto the outside of the vials (1). The vials (1) are then hot air sterilised (step C)    by   passing   them   into   a    sterilising   chamber    (4    -    see<br><br>
Figure 3&gt;) where hot air is blown onto the vials (1). The sterilised magazines (2) full of vials (1) are then carried by the conveying means onto a Fill-Spin-Freeze (FSF) section (5) where the filling (D) and freezing (E) steps take place. The apparatus for carrying out these steps is shown  more  particularly  in  Figures   8   to   IS.<br>
Filling step (D) and Freezing step (E) : In a filling<br>
and freezing operation, the vials (1) and magazines (2)<br>
enter the FSF section (5} and are allowed to cool to the<br>
FSF internal temperature (typically about -50°C) . Vials<br>
(1) are removed from the magazines (2) one row at a time,<br>
(or feasibly two rows at a time) these being picked up by a<br>
robot arm (not shown in Figures 1 and 2} carrying a<br>
plurality of rotatable gripping means in the form of multi-<br>
fingered gripper (5) .	The vials (1) are rotated to<br>
horizontal and the robot arm swings 9 0° to the side of the<br>
FSF chamber. The vials (1) are rapidly rotated and  billed<br>
with the required dose of aqueous material, particularly a<br>
drug material such as a vaccine. Optionally the vials may<br>
be firstly filled then spun, but preferably the filling<br>
occurs while simultaneously spinning the vial (1) . The<br>
speed of rotation or spinning should be not less than that<br>
required to maintain the aqueous material in a shell (7) of<br>
substantially uniform thickness against the inner walls of<br>
the vial (1) . The vials (1) are then moved over nozzles<br>
from which is blown cold gas (typically - nitrogen at about<br>
-150°C) to expose the spinning aqueous material to freezing<br>
conditions sufficient to freeze the material into the shell<br>
(7). The frozen shell (and later the dried shell) will be<br>
of a substantially uniform thickness - i.e. the thickness<br>
of  the  shell  measured  at  any  position  along  the  axis  of  the<br><br>
vial will not vary more than about 5% providing that the thickness is measured as the average between any surface peaks or troughs which may result from fluid dynamics during the freezing process. After a preset time to complete freezing, the spinning is stopped and the vials (1) returned to the magazine (2) . The temperature of the interior of the enclosure is maintained sufficiently cold so  that  the  shells  do  not  melt.<br>
Weighing Step (F): Whilst a row of vials {1) is being filled and frozen, other vials (1) are weighed by indexing the magazine (2) back and forward over the weigh load cells (8 - Figure 1) . This allows all vials (1) to be weighed before and after filling to check the correct dosage has been dispensed. The weigh load cells (8) are shown more particularly  in  Figure  16.<br>
Turn    over    of    vials     (Step    G) ;	After    filling    and<br>
freezing, the vials (1) are (optionally) turned over from upside-down to the correct way up (see Figure 1). This is achieved by picking up the vials (1) (one row at a time) from one magazine (2) and transferring them to the magazine in front. A transfer arm (9) holding sufficient grippers for a row of vials holds the vials (1) around their centre and rotates 180° about a horizontal axis across the direction of movement of the magazine (2) . The vials (1) are then released the correct way up on the magazine in front (2). This optional step demands that there is always the equivalent of an empty magazine in the process, which is loaded at the start of production. In the process of Figure 2, this turn over step does not occur and the vials are loaded inverted back into the magazine (2) before being conveyed  onto  the  drying  section  of  the  process.<br><br>
Vacuum Tunnel - Entry air Lock (Step H) : Once the material in the vial (1) has been frozen, it is ready for drying. The magazine (2) enters an air lock chamber (lOa) between the FSF chamber (4) and a vacuum drying tunnel (11) . The outer door (12a) of the airlock (10a) then closes and the air pressure is reduced to the same as the vacuum tunnel (11) . The inner door (13a) then opens and the magazine (2) enters the vacuum chamber (11). The outer door   (12a}   is  then  opened  ready  for  the  next  magazine   (2)  .<br>
The magazines (2) in the vacuum tunnel (11) move by conveyor means in an indexing motion one complete magazine length at a time, typically every 10 mines. When the magazines (2) have been indexed to the new stations heater blocks (14) lower over the vials (1). These direct heat substantially radially inwards to the vial over substantially the whole surface area of the shell frozen material (7) and thereby provide the energy to sublime off the water and freeze dry the material (7} . Immediately prior to the magazines (2) indexing the heater blocks are raised to their first position to allow the magazine (2) and vials (1) to pass underneath and move one magazine (2) length to the next heater block (14) . The heater blocks (14) are each set to a different temperature, so giving the temperature profile necessary to achieve the correct drying conditions for the particular drug material being handled. The freeze-dried shell material (7) produced according to the invention is shown more clearly in Figure 4b. The conventional  plug  dried  product   is   shown   in  Figure   4A.<br>
At   the   end   of   the  vacuum  tunnel   there   is   a   second   air¬lock.      This   works   in   a   similar  way   to   the   input   air   lock.<br><br>
allowing   the  vials   out   whilst   maintaining   the   vacuum   in   the main   tunnel.<br>
Plugging      (Step     J):	There     are     two     options     for<br>
plugging. One is to carry out plugging in the outlet air lock (lOb) . In this case the plugs (15) would enter the air lock (lOa) as a magazine (2) exits. The plugs (15) would be pushed into the vials (1) before opening the outer door {12b); this allows plugging at any desired pressure and in any chosen gas. The second option is to plug after the air lock (10b) in a sterile plugging area (16) {see Figure 3). Conventional equipment could be used here but the size of the sterile area (16) would increase as a result.<br>
Capping (Step K): The crimping of caps (17) onto the plugs {15) could use standard equipment and be carried out in  a  clean   (but  not  necessarily  sterile)   area.<br>
The whole freeze-drying process is operated from a central control station more particularly shown in Figure 4.<br>
Figures 5 to 7 show a magazine {2) used for carrying the vials (1) through the whole freeze-drying process. The magazine (2) of Figure 5 comprises a tray {18) having an upper and lower surface and having eight rows of eight equispaced location apertures {19} extending through the tray {18) for locating the necks of the vials. Each set of four locating apertures (19) defines the four corners of a square in which an air flow aperture (20) has been cut away. A concave abutment (21) adjacent each aperture trace the circumference of the base of a vial (1) about the vertical    axis    of    the    locating    aperture     (19)     to    form    a<br><br>
locating flange (22) on which vial (1) can be located in the  upright   position.<br>
The vials (1) are preferably held in an inverted position as shown in Figure 7. This Figure also shows that the top surface of the vial neck preferably does not contact the magazine (2) so that any particles which may be produced by fretting between vial {1) and magazine (2) at point A are unlikely to contaminate the inside of the vial (1) .<br>
The vial is supported on its neck at point E. This design depends upon the diameter of the vial (1) being greater  than  the  diameter  of  the  neck  of  the  vial.<br>
The location aperture (19) in the magazine (2) is<br>
preferably     castellated     as     shown     in     Figure     6.	The<br>
castellations (23) allow water to be jetted between vial (1) and magazine (2) during the washing process to remove any particles that may have been trapped in the gap. The open area of the air-flow aperture (20) allows the free passage of air through the magazine during hot air sterilisation and for cold laminar air flow in the FSF section   (5)     (see   Figure   15)  .<br>
Locating holes (24) towards the outer edge of the magazine are preferably provided for precise positioning. The holes are circular on one side and elongated on the other side to allow for position location without overconstraint.<br>
As shown more particularly in Figures 8 and 9, the<br>
means	for        conveying        the        magazines	through	the<br>
lyophilisation process preferably comprises a plurality of parallel rollers (25) axially mounted near both ends of corresponding    rotatable    shafts     (26)     which    in    turn    are<br><br>
suspended between two long parallel side supports (27) . Referring to figure 7, each roller has an outwardly and circumferentially extending flange {28) on which the magazine rests and is moved along. Also mounted on the rotatable shaft (26) adjacent the roller is a toothed drive gear wheel (29). The underside of the magazine (2) has a rack with teeth (30) to engage with the teeth of the drive gear   (29)   and  index  the  magazine   (2)   along.<br>
Through the whole process the magazine {2) is<br>
supported on a series of these rollers (25) , not all of<br>
which have drive teeth. Furthermore not all of the drive<br>
teeth will move at the same time, thereby giving controlled<br>
indexing    of    the    magazine    throughout    the    process.	For<br>
example within the FSF chamber (5) , the magazine (2) is<br>
preferably indexed by one row at a time, typically one row<br>
per minute. It will also move back and forth by one or<br>
two rows (as described hereafter) above the check weighing<br>
cells     (8) .	In    the    drying    chamber     (11),     however    the<br>
magazine (2) is preferably indexed by a whole magazine length at a time, one index every 8 minutes for example. Therefore the rollers in the FSF chamber (5) would not be directly linked to those in the drying chamber (11). The conveying rollers are however synchronised where necessary to provide a smooth transfer between different roller sections.<br>
Figure 9 shows a side view of the drive roller arrangement transporting magazines (2) through the process. More particularly, the figure represents the movement from the FSF region (5) to the airlock (10) and the vacuum chamber (11) through air lock doors (12a and 13^), In order to   move    a   magazine    from   region   to    region,     each    set    of<br><br>
rollers needs to be driven independently. Tne rollers [Ah) are connected together in groups by drive shafts (31,32,33) and are driven by independent drive motors (34,35 and 36). Each motor (34 to 36) is position controlled by central software to provide the necessary movements and to synchronise movement between adjacent groups during magazine  transfer  from  group  to  group.<br>
The transfer of magasine (2) and vials (1) throughout the process on the preferred roller conveyor arrangement (25 to 35) of the invention has a number of advantages for use particularly in a continuous freeze-drying process. This is especially so in comparison with conventional drives which might be for example flat bed conveyors, chain link conveyors, other conveyor types or trays as used in conventional  freeze  drying.     These  are  as  follows:<br>
1.	There is no vial-to-vial contact. This reduces the amount of particle generation caused by fretting and reduces  the  chances  of  a  vial  fracture.<br>
2.	The magazine design is very open for the washing and sterilising process. Washing is better because the exact vial location is known hence wash jets can be directed at key parts of the vial. The open spaces of the magazine allow the hot air of sterilisation to pass   freely  through  the  magazine.<br>
3.	The open structure also allows good airflow in the FSF region where downwards laminar air flow is needed to maintain  very  low  particle   levels   in   the   region  of   the<br><br>
vials.       The   layout   of   the   supporting   rollers   is   also clean  and  simple  and  hence  helps  air  flow.<br>
4.	The magazines and rollers themselves constitute a greatly reduced source of particles in comparison with conventional conveyors which tend to have large numbers  of  fretting  surfaces.<br>
5.	Since the magazines preferably pass through the whole process (rather than short lengths of conveyors in each section) there is only a minimum of mechanical handling of the vials. There is no need for any vial handling stage between the steriliser and the FSF chamber for example, nor between the FSF and the drying  chamber.<br>
6.	Since the magazines preferably pass through the whole process (rather than short lengths of conveyors in each section) they are repeatedly cleaned i.e. they are cleaned and sterilised on each path through, whereas a conveyor contained within any one machine element would not be cleaned and hence would have the possibility  to  cause  vial-to-vial  contamination.<br>
7.	The separate nature of the magazines allows them to pass through the air lock doors on entry to and exit from the tunnel. This is possible because the air lock (sliding) doors can be located between two parallel  rollers.<br><br>
a. Since each vial is located in its individual location in the magazine, the vials can be readily located when necessary e.g. for gripping for the FSF process, for heating in the drying chamber and for plugging. Conventional vial transport generally requires a separate mechanism for vial alignment prior to handling  stages.<br>
9. Since each vial is located in its individual location in the magazine it can be individually tracked through the process for development purposes or to identify a particular vial in the event of a process failure such as poor filling. A vial which is identified by the check weigh system as faulty, can therefore be subsequently retrieved at any convenient stage in the process.<br>
Referring  to   Figure   8   the  magazines   (2)   and  vials   (1) are   moved   through   the   FSF   chamber   (5)    in   the   direction   of the   arrow   from   the   rear  to   the   front   end   thereof   and   then<br>
into   the   continuous  vacuum  drying   tunnel(consisting   of   the<br>
and  figure  9), air  locks   (10a,10b)   and  drying  chamber   (11)  as   seen  in  figure  3  /<br>
A robotic handler (37) is fixedly located towards the front end of the FSF chamber (5) and alongside the roller conveyor   (2 5   to   36}.<br>
An arm (38) carrying a plurality of   gripper means (39) extends perpendicularly from the upper end of the robotic handler (37) and is controlled thereby.<br>
A filling (40) and freezing station (41) are both located   in   the   chamber    (5)    alongside   the   roller   conveyor<br><br>
(25  to  36)   and  rearward  of  the  robotic  handler   (37).     The<br><br>
filling station (4 0) consists of a row of needle nozzles (42) which each has a connector (43) for connecting outside the FSF chamber to a reservoir of the aqueous material to be lyophilised {44 - see Figure 9) . The freezing station (41) also contains a row of needle nozzles (45) which also each has an adapter (46) for connecting to a supply of freezing nitrogen gas (44) also outside the FSF chamber. The nozzles (42) of the freezing station (40) are located directly below the nozzles (42) of the filling station (41) and both sets of nozzles (42,45) are mounted on a casing (47) at approximately the same height as the arm (38). The filling and gas reservoirs (44) are conveniently located outside the FSF chamber (5) so that the FSF chamber (5) can be maintained as clean as possible {see Figure 9) . The filling needles (42) is provided with either heating means or thermal insulation to prevent the liquid material freezing  inside  the  needle   (42)   during  filling.<br>
Figure 11 shows the rotatable vial gripper means (6)<br>
in cross-sect ion. The vial (1) is held in concentrically<br>
moving fingers {48} which are designed to hold the vial (1)<br>
with its axis accurately concentric with the axis of<br>
rotation of the gripper {6). The fingers (48) are housed<br>
and are axially movable within an outer casing (49) and<br>
have outwardly extending projections (50) which are<br>
slidably receivable into complimentary recesses (51) in the<br>
outer casing (49) or visa versa. The vial (1) is spun to<br>
produce  a  shell	of  the  liquid  drug  inside  the  vial   (1).<br>
The   vial    (1)    is   then   transferred   to   a   position   enclosing<br>
the   freezing   gas   nozzle   to   freeze   the   shell,	This<br>
ensures    that    the    frozen    shell	has    a    substantially<br><br>
uniform wall thickness, and is an improvement over rolling while freezing. The fingers (48) are controlled by a push rod (52} extending axially along the gripper shaft (53) connected between the base of the fingers and a flange (55). The fingers are opened by the movement of an actuator frame (54) (which is mounted within the robot arm (37)) in the direction of the arrows against the flange(5S)therby compressing a spring (56) against the flange(55) and a second flange (not shown). In the open position the fingers (48) are pushed axially out of the outer casing (49) by the push rod (52) such that the projections (50) slide into the complimentary recesses (51) thereby allowing the fingers to open. In the closed position the force of the spring (56) pulls the fingers (42) axially into the casing (43) and the projections (50) slide out from the recesses (51) thereby forcing the fingers(4 8) to close, as with a cullet. This arrangement has the advantage that in the event of power failure to the flange actuator (53} , the fingers (48) will remain clamped shut. In the open position, the frame actuator(54) abuts the flange(55), but in the closed position they are spaced apart allowing free rotation  of   the  whole  gripping  arrangement(6).<br>
Each rotatable gripping means (6) is designed with a sufficient chamfered lead-in (57) that even a poorly shaped vial (1) located poorly in a magazine will still move smoothly into the gripper means (6) when it is lowered over the  magazine.<br>
Figure 12 shows the drive arrangement (58,59) by which the gripping means (6) are all rotated. There is a single drive motor (58) linked to each gripper shaft (53) by a toothed   timing  belt    (59).<br><br>
As shown more particularly in Figure 13, since the FSF<br>
atmosphere is at about -50°C, the robot arm (37) is covered<br>
by outer sleeve (60) which has internal insulation (61).<br>
The arm (37) is held at room temperature by<br>
thermostatically controlled heater element (62). The outer<br>
sleeve (60) contains a sliding seal (63) to allow rotation<br>
and the robot handler (37) is provided with flexible<br>
bellows (64) to allow vertical motion relative to magazine<br>
(2).	This    arrangement    means    that    the    insulated    outer<br>
sleeve (60,61) provides thermal insulation between the cold atmosphere and the relatively warm mechanical components of the  arm   (38).<br>
The outer covering (60,61) of the arm (37) serves at least  two  purposes.<br>
1.	To allow the arm mechanisms to operate at room temperature while the arm is mounted within the FSF enclosure.<br>
2.	To      protect      the      clean      FSF      environment      from      any particles  which  are  generated  by  movable  parts   such  as the    spinning   gripper   shafts    (53)    or   the   drive   belt (59)  .<br>
Air which is contained inside the enclosure will be extracted from the enclosure via vent aperture (64) and does not require any fan for extraction since the enclosure will be positively pressurised. This extraction will cause relatively high air velocity in the narrow aperture (65) between the spinning gripping means (6) and the outer arm casing (60), which will tend to carry any particles generated in the vicinity of the gripping means (6) together   with   any   particles   generated   within   the   interior<br><br>
atmosphere   of   the   robot   arm   {3 7}   towards   the   vent   aperture 64)    and  hence   away   from  the   clean  area  of   the  vials    (1).<br>
In  a   fill,    spin,    freeze   cycle,    the   arm   (37}    is   lowered<br>
'erotically    from    a    first    position    in   which    the    gripping<br>
leans   {6}    are   disposed  perpendicular   to   the   roller   conveyor<br>
!25   to   36)   and  spaced  above   the  vials   (1)   carried  thereon,<br>
      (6)<br>
   the   base   of   a  vial    (1).      Typically  one   row   of   vials<br>
    are  removed  simultaneously  from  the  magazine   (2) .      The<br>
  (37)    is   then   raised   to   the   first   position   and   rotated<br>
   90°  to  a   third  position  in  which   the  gripping  means<br>
ire    substantially   parallel    to    the    roller   conveyor    (25    to<br>
i6)   and   the   vials   (1)   are   held   substantially  horizontally.<br>
The   arm   (37)   then  swings   through   90°   in  a   horizontal   plane<br>
Ln  front   of   the   filling  means   so  that   a  nozzle   (42)   of  the<br>
     station     (40)    extends    in    through    the    neck    of    a<br>
corresponding   vial    (1} .      The   vials   are   then   rotated   at   a<br>
  speed  of  about  3000  rpm  and  a  measured  dose  of  aqueous<br>
       is     simultaneously    injected    into    the    vial      (1),<br>
     the     material     to    be     maintained     in     a     shell      (7)<br>
against   the   inner   walls   of   the   vial    (1)    by   the   action   of<br>
centrifugal   force.      The   vials    (1)    are   then  withdrawn   from<br>
the   nozzles    (42)    of   the   filling   station    (40)    and   the   arm<br>
(38)   lowered  to  the  height  of   the  freezing  station   (41)   and<br>
moved    towards    it    so    that     the    nozzles     (45)     thereof    are<br>
inserted   into   the   vials    (1)    and   a   controlled   jet   of   cold<br>
nitrogen  gas   (typically  of   a  temperature  of  about   -50°C)   is<br>
injected    into    the   vial     (1)     whilst    it    is    simultaneously<br>
rotating   to   freeze   the   aqueous   material    into   a    shell     (7)<br>
against   the   inner   walls   of   the   vial    (1) ,      After   a   preset<br>
time   to  allow   freezing   (typically  between   30   to   60   seconds)<br><br>
the   rotation   is   stopped   and   the   vials    (1)    returned   to   the magazine    (2).<br>
One major advantage deriving from the very short<br>
freezing cycle time is that the throughput capacity of a<br>
conventional freeze-drying apparatus can be accommodated on<br>
a much smaller scale of apparatus. As a result the process<br>
can be more easily automated and continuous thereby<br>
excluding human operators from the process and thus<br>
maximizing the sterility of the process. To achieve this,<br>
the interior of the process line must be isolated from the<br>
exterior by 'isolation technology'. This requires both a<br>
barrier to the ingress of dirt or bacteria and also means<br>
internally so that the chamber (4) can be cleaned and<br>
sterilised automatically - i.e. it must be cleared when<br>
sealed closed and it must remain sealed throughout the<br>
whole production of a batch. Therefore preferably the<br>
whole freeze-drying process of the invention is designed<br>
for reliable mechanical handling. That is if a vial (1) is<br>
dropped or is broken during the process then it is very<br>
hard to continue without an operator going inside the<br>
isolator to tidy up. If this is necessary then sterility<br>
is lost, product in the area must be discarded and the<br>
procedure for cleaning and sterilisation must be repeated<br>
before    production    can    continue.	This    would    be    a    time<br>
consuming   and   costly   delay,    and   hence   reliable   mechanisms are  important.<br>
Figure 15 shows how a sterile barrier is arranged in the PSF area (5) . The figure is a cross section of the production line, looking in the direction of product flow. The barrier itself (66) is shown as a thick wall because of the   necessity   for   thermal   insulation   (internal   temperature<br><br>
may be -50°C). The internal gas is circulated round by fan<br>
(57) in the direction of the various arrows. As the air<br>
passes through filter ("HEPA' filter) (68) fine particles<br>
and micro-organisms are removed and the flow is also evened<br>
out so that the flow in the region below the filter (68) is<br>
laminar,     downwards.	The    downwards     flow    of     clean    air<br>
ensures that the filling process and the waiting vials (1) are in clean air and that any particles shed in these or other  regions   are   carried  downwards   and  clear  of   the  vials.<br>
The injection of the freezing gas to form the shell is<br>
shown    more    particularly    in    Figure    14.	Preferably    the<br>
freezing   nozzle    (42)    has   a   plurality   of   ports    (69)    along its   length  through  which  the  freezing  gas  is  injected.<br>
The substantially horizontal orientation of the vial (1) mitigates the problem of producing a parabolic surface to the shell and helps form a shell of substantially uniform thickness. The rate of heat transfer from gas to product is increased by increasing the temperature difference (by having colder gas) and by increasing relative velocity between gas and liquid. Very high gas velocity however will disrupt the liquid shell and cause an uneven frozen shape. The pattern of ports (69} in the side of the nozzle (42) (Figure 14) mitigates this problem by reducing  any  local  peaks  in  gas  velocity.<br>
Since the vial (1) can be simultaneously spun and filled it is possible to fill the vial beyond the limit where the aqueous material would spill over the neck if the vials were not spinning. For sensitive drugs, it may be advantageous to do the filling at a lower rotational speed than  the  freezing,   to  minimize  the  effect  of  shear.<br><br>
It is advantageous to be able to weigh every vial (1) ;o that the weight of filled product in each vial can be checked and any process deviations noted and corrected, 'his means for example that if one of the filling pumps was -ending to fill slightly less than target fill weight then :he pump could be adjusted to keep the fill weight under :control. Any total filling failure for example caused by a )lockage  would  be  instantly  recognised.<br>
The weigh cells (8) are located in the FSF area (5) madder one row of vials adjacent to the robot arm (37) (Figure 16). The weigh cells (8) are mounted on a frame (BA) such that when the frame (8A) is raised then all the   (1) in that row are lifted by the weigh cells (8) :liar of the magazine (2) and their individual weights can De determined. The direction of magazine indexing is shown 3y  the  arrow.<br>
The  sequence  of   filling  and  weighing  is  as  follows:<br>
Row   1   is   indexed  over  the  weigh  cells   and   is  weighed, 5mpty.<br>
The robotic arm (38) then picks row 1, spin-fills and freezes   it.<br>
During this time the magazine (2) moves so that row 2 is  indexed  over  the  weigh  cells   (8)   and  is  weighed,   empty.<br>
Row   1   is   then  returned  to   the   magazine   (2).<br>
The robotic arm (38) then picks row 2, spin-fills and freezes  it.<br>
During this time the magazine (2) moves so that row 3 is indexed over the weigh cells (8) and is weighed, empty and then row 1 is indexed over the weigh cells (8) and is weighed,    full.<br>
Row  2   is  then  returned  to  the  magazine   (2).<br><br>
The robotic arm (32} then picks row 3, spin-fills and freezes   it.<br>
During this time the magazine moves so that row 4 is indexed over the weigh cells (8) and is weighed, empty and then row 2 is indexed over the weigh cells (8} and is weighed,    full.<br>
Row 3 is then returned to the magazine (2) . This process is repeated until all vials (1) in the magazine (2) have been weighed and filled. The next magazine (2) is then   indexed  forward.<br>
It is preferable that each vial (1) is weighed before and after filling as described because the difference between fill weights that must be detected is less than the likely difference in vial (1) weights. Preferably also each vial is weighed each time on the same weigh cell (8) so that variations between weigh cells {8) will have no effect   on   the   accuracy  of   the  measurement.<br>
Drying (Step I) : The apparatus for drying the shell frozen material (7} is more particularly shown in Figures 17   to   20.<br>
The     vials       (1)      pass      through     the     vacuum     tunnel {10a,10b,ll)   from   the  rear  to   the   front.      The  vacuum   tunnel (10a,10b,11)   comprises   a   sealed  vacuum  drying   chamber   (11) and  airlock  chambers   (I0a,10b)   at  the  rear  and  front  end  of the   drying   chamber    (11).       Each   airlock    (I0a,10b)    has   an inner   (13a,13b}   and  outer   (12a,12b)   door.   The  magazine    (2) enters  the   front  air  lock   (10a)   between  the  FSF  chamber   (5) and  a  vacuum  drying  chamber   (11)  .      The   outer  door   Cl2a)   of the  first  airlock   (10a)   then  closes  and  the  air  pressure   is reduced    to    the    same    as    the    vacuum   drying    chambers     (11)  . The   inner  door   {13a)   of   the   front   airlock   (10a)   then  opens<br><br>
and the magazine (2) enters the vacuum drying chamber (11). The inner door (13a) is then closed, the outer door (12a) of the front airlock (10a) then opens ready for the next magazine   (2).<br>
A conveyor means (not shown) preferably of the same roller conveyor arrangement (25 to 36} in the PSF chamber (5) is provided for moving the magazines (2) of vials (1) through the vacuum tunnel (10a,10b,11}. A series of heater blocks (70) are spaced along the length of the vacuum chamber (11) above the conveyor means (25 to 36) and magazines (2) . As shown more particularly in Figure 18 (which   shows   the   plan  view   of   a   portion  of   a   heater  block<br>
(70)	and vials}, the heating blocks (70) comprise a<br>
plurality of tubular heating chambers (71) corresponding to<br>
the  number  of  vials   (1)   in  each  magazine   (2).     Each  chamber<br>
(71)	is defined by a tubular wall (72) which extends to a<br>
height just above the top of the vial (1), and the heating<br>
chamber (71) is optionally provided with a top (72} which<br>
optionally may have an aperture (73) communicating with the<br>
drying chamber (11) , to release water vapour from the<br>
chamber (71) (Figure 1}. In the embodiment of Figure 2,<br>
there is no aperture in the top of each heating chamber<br>
(71) but the vial (1) is inverted and water vapour escapes<br>
through the locating aperture (3) of the magazine (2). The<br>
lower end of each heating chamber is open to receive the<br>
vial (1). The heating blocks (70) are moveable vertically<br>
from a first position above the magazines (2) to a second<br>
position in which they are lowered so that the base of the<br>
heating block (70) rests on or near to the upper surface of<br>
the magazine (2) such that each vial (1) fits snugly into a<br>
heating    chamber    (71)     In   the    embodiment    of    Figure    18,    a<br><br>
small space is left between the body of each vial (1) and the inner walls (72) of the corresponding heating chamber (71). In this position heat can pass radially inwards from the heating block to the shell frozen material (7) over a substantial area of the shell (7) in the direction of the arrows {Figure 18) . The heat is transferred by radiation and by conduction and convection through the residual gas which exists in the (vacuum) heating chamber (71) . The vacuum space between the heating chamber wall (72) and the body of the vial is important in that it has an effect on how efficiently heat is transferred to the shell (7) of material. Preferably the proximity of the heating wall and vial (1) is about 5mm or less, more preferably about 3mm or less. In the embodiment shown the proximate distance is about   1mm.<br>
The heater block (70) is constructed of a good thermally conducting material. Aluminium, for example, is suitable providing it is treated to prevent the production of particles caused by surface oxidation for example by anodising. The temperature of the heater block (70) can be maintained by the passage of heating fluid through an element or pipe (73) attached to, or a conduit (73) running  through  the  heating  block   (70).<br>
Although the heating block (70) passes heat into the vials (1) , it will sometimes be necessary for the block (70) to be cooled in order to maintain correct temperature (if for example the heat gain from ambient to the block (70) is greater than the heat lost from the block (61) to the vials (1) . (Cooling is also needed at the start of a batch). For this reason the blocks (70) are controlled by a   fluid   which   can  be   heated   or   cooled   and   not   just   by   an<br><br>
electrical heater element. In particular during primary drying the vials (1) may be at -50°C and the heater blocks at   -20°C.<br>
Figure 19 shows an alternative heating means to the heating blocks (70) of Figure 18. In this embodiment long heating walls (74) are provided running in parallel along each side of and down the middle (longitudinally) of the conveyor means (25 to 36) on which the magazines (2) rest. Each wall (74) is approximately the same height as the vials (1) when they are resting on the magazine (2) . As with the heating blocks, the heating walls are preferably controlled by circulating a thermal liquid through an element (73) running through or attached to the walls (74). The walls (74) consist of separate sections, the temperature of which progressively increases along the vacuum chamber (11) in the direction of the large arrow such that the temperature experienced by the shell frozen material (7) in each vial (1) progressively increases as it moves axially along the drying chamber (11) . The thermal pathway for heat transfer is again radially inwards (as shown) by the arrows from the heating walls to the shell frozen material (3) over a substantial area of the shell, thereby drying the shell (7) much quicker than previous methods in the art. Again the heat transfer will be by a combination of conduction or convection and radiation in the vacuum space between the heating walls (74) and the vials (1) . As before the proximity between the heat ing walls (74) and body of the vials is preferably 5mm or less, more  preferably  about   3mm  or   less.<br>
The    difference    between    the    heating    embodiments    of Figures   16   and   17   is   that   the   vial    (1)    is   passed   between<br><br>
two heating walls (74} instead of being received into a heating chamber (70) . As a consequence, it is no longer necessary to lift the heating blocks to allow the vials (1) to move and therefore the embodiment of Figure 19 lends itself to a more simplified design. The disadvantage, however, is the longer thermal pathway and less efficient heat transfer from the heating walls (74) to the shell (7). By substantially enclosing the vial with the heating means, such as with the heating chamber (71) of the heating block (7),   a  faster  drying  time  is  achieved.<br>
With both the heating block (70) and heating walls (74), because the heaters are individually temperature controlled, products passing along the tunnel are exposed to a drying cycle, such as for example: 1 hour at -25°C, ^ hour at +5°C, ^ hour at +5°C, !4 hour at +40°C, and hi hour at +4 0°C.<br>
Figure 20 shows in plan view the arrangement of vacuum pumps and condensers on the side of the vacuum chamber (11) and air locks {10a,10b) . There is a separate vacuum pump (75) and condenser (76) for each air lock (10a, 10b) and multiple vacuum pumps (75) are disposed along the length of the tunnel. The vacuum will become progressively higher along the length of the tunnel (10a,10b,11) as the product becomes progressively more dry. Isolating doors (77) can therefore be provided at intermediate positions in the tunnel to isolate a vessel, if it is found that product is sensitive to the degree of vacuum which is applied during secondary  drying.<br>
The condensers (76) will become progressively covered with ice as more product passes down the tunnel. For the purpose     of     defrosting,      the     product     on     run     can     be<br><br>
interrupted but preferably there should be a surplus of condensing capacity such that each condenser (76) can be isolated by means of the valve (78) for defrosting after which time it can be put back into service without interruption  of  production.<br>
In both of the illustrated embodiments (Figures 16 and 17} of the heating means (i.e. using the heating blocks (61) and heating walls (67)), the heat passes radially inwards from the heating means to the shell frozen material in each vial. As a result the product is dried much quicker than conventional drying apparatus where the vial rests on a heated shelf (and thus only the base is heated directly) . In this case heat passes axially upwards from the base through the glass walls causing a temperature gradient that increases the time required to dry the shell (7) . Furthermore, because of the efficient heat transfer conditions, the drying process and apparatus of the invention is less energy demanding than the previous process.<br><br><br>
