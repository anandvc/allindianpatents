				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>POLYMORPHIC KEYBOARD FOR PHYSICALLY HANDICAPPED ABSTRACT In order to have high-tech life with the computer for a handicapped person in his/her day to day activities, communication with others, research work, entertainment and in many fields, a polymorphic keyboard has been thought of to interact with the computers as one has to move his hand over the normal keyboard with mouse which is painful for the handicapped. With the mouse, it is still difficult for him to perform. This designed polymorphic keyboard, that is four times shorter than the normal keyboard in the computers has been designed to enable a handicapped person to operate without strain. The keyboard that has been designed is polymorphic which provides a solution to have access to computers using an economical keyboard for the single hand, single finger handicapped persons and persons in the wheel chair, allowing them to explore the opportunities offered by information technology. It is a single handheld device and can be operated with a single finger. This device has 16 keys which brings into the entire operation of 104 computer keyboard. It can be used to control 5 appliances simultaneously and to interact with the personal computer.</td>

DESCRIPTION<br>
(1) OBJECTIVE OF THE INVENTION;<br>
The objective of the invention is to give comfort to the physically handicapped persons, such as those with the loss of one hand or persons, who can move only in the wheel chairs. By providing them with a "Multifunctional wireless remote keyboard" which is capable of giving input/output to the distant computer, which can control at the maximum of five electrical devices such as light (No.6 as shown in figure 1), tape recorder (No.5 as shown in figure 1), Television(No.7 as shown in figure l)or any commercial equipment like billing machine around the person, ergonomically designed for the physically handicapped.<br>
A polymorphic keyboard designed with 16 keys (No.l as shown in figure 1) compactly is used here and this acts as a remote controller. In this keyboard, each key performs multiple functions based on the mode of operation. Shortcut functions can also be operated with predefined keys in the remote keyboard. This keyboard operates using Frequency Modulation for communication with the distant computer.<br>
This polymorphic keyboard has the enhanced virtual mode where desktop shortcuts, small sequence of operations required to be done can be configured and triggered by pressing a single button. This is a single hand operated wireless device and it can be operated by a single finger.<br>
No additional add on card is necessary. All controls and input operations can be performed with the personal computer and is compatible with most of the softwares like Word Pad, Power Point, and Excel that run on the windows platform. Peripheral Interface Controller and Visual Basic are used for the implementation of this operation. It is compact and hence cost is low.<br>
This novel and fully functional remote keyboard for physically handicapped which can control the electrical devices around the person, has been invented for the first time.<br><br>
(2)ALLIED INVENTIONS SEEN IN THE LITERATURE:<br>
A thorough literature survey, by search through many websites has been done. Copies of some of them are enclosed for perusal in Annexure I and Annexure II. So far no invention is exactly the same as what has been found out by the inventors. Hence, it is a new invention.<br>
(3) EXISTING CONVENTIONAL COMPUTER KEYBOARD AND PRESENT DESIGNED POLYMORPHIC KEYBOARD;<br>
1.	The existing conventional computer keyboard (No.2 as shown in figure l)is connected to the computer through the wire. Hence it cannot be noved out over a distance more than the length of the wire.<br>
2.	The size of this keyboard is 4 times longer than the designed )olymorphic keyboard. Due to its size, it is difficult for a single handed )erson to operate it.<br>
3.	The number of keys available are 104 in the existing conventional<br>
omputer keyboard(No.2 as shown in figure 1). In present design, there are<br>
only 16 keys to perform the entire operation of the existing keyboard.<br>
Till date to the best of our knowledge, we have not found any omparable invention of a remote form of keyboard with the full inctionality of a normal keyboard for physically handicapped which can also control the industrial and electrical appliances simultaneously.<br>
1) WORKING OF THE POLYMORPHIC KEYBOARD;<br>
he polymorphic keyboard designed in this product is made compact, by sing only 16 keys (No.las shown in figure 1). Each key is assigned 4 laracters or symbols in order to bring the entire normal 104 keys of a )rmal keyboard into this 16 keys remote keyboard and 104 keys are vided into groups. These groups are implemented by providing mode key ith shift operation and layer key to form key groups. The key arrangement done to facilitate easy typing using a single finger by the single hand ndicapped persons. An enter key, four cursor key, 1 mode key, 1 layer key d 9 key group sum up to form 16 keys compact remote keyboard.<br><br>
(5)	USING POLYMORPHIC KEYBOARD;<br>
Selecting the TEXT Mode and CONTROL mode respectively (shown in fig. 3) does the typing and control operation of the computer. In text Mode, Shift option helps to switch between Capital and Small letters, Numbers and symbols. For control operations the user has to select Control Mode by pressing the Layer key. The user can switch between Control Mode and Text Mode as per the requirement.<br>
(6)	CONSTRUCTION OF THE DEVICE;<br>
This Polymorphic Keyboard device consists of three modules:<br>
I)	TRANSMITTER MODULE;<br>
This module (as shown in figure 2) consists of Compact Keypad consisting of only 16 keys. The key pressed is encoded using the DTMF encoder and is fi'equency modulated for transmission using FM Transmitter.<br>
II)	RECEIVER MODULE;<br>
The FM Receiver in this module (No.3 as shown in figure 1) receives the transmitted signal. The received signal is decoded by the DTMF decoder . The decoder output is provided as Input to the PIC Microcontroller This microcontroller converts the input 4 bit hexadecimal code into an 8 bit ASCII code and send signals to the serial port of the computer or to the Appliances On/Off unit to perform the task desired by the user.<br>
III)	DEVICE DRIVER MODULE;<br>
This module (No.2 as shown in figure l)is coded using Visual Basic 6.0 to implement the operating modes according to the requirement of the user. This reads the serial port and issues appropriate messages to the application in the Windows platform to get the desired result of typing/control. This module can be extended to provide a Virtual mode in which the user can assign shortcuts to commands for each application, assign long sentences to a single key, etc<br><br>
(7)   EXECUTION   OF   THE   COMMAND   BY   DEVICE   DRIVER MODULE<br>
The key pressed is interpreted and the symbol is identified. The mode of operation of the keyboard is based on the mode selection word.     The scan code for the key pressed and the desired symbol is assigned according to the mode which is currently selected. The scan code is placed in the keyboard buffer to execute the key pressed.<br>
(8)COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS:<br>
•	Playing, pausing, and stopping of movies &amp; songs in Computer Home Entertainment.<br>
•	Power Point Presenter for Seminar halls. Auditoriums etc.<br>
•	Playing computer games from a distance.<br>
•	Wireless   Switching   of  Fans,   lights   etc   in   Offices,   Homes, Auditoriums etc.<br>
•	Increases employability in the process control and instrumentation industries for the physically handicapped.<br>
(9)SOCIAL APPLICATIONS OF THIS PRODUCT;<br>
•	Perfect companion for the above said physically handicapped persons as this makes them highly independent in doing their works easily, either in the computer or switching other electrical, electronic appliances.<br>
•	Provides flexibility to a Computer staff in schools to operate the computer while being closer with the students in the classes, computer labs etc.<br>
•	Makes brief interaction with the distant computer easier for all, thus saving time and energy.<br>
(10)FEATUES OF THE PRODUCT;<br>
•	This product is compatible for the most Software in the windows platform.<br>
•	It is easy to plug and operate the device.<br>
•	This is the multipurpose single finger operated device, which is economical.<br>
•	Minimum of five appliances can be connected to the switching unit.<br>
•	Large scope for marketability.<br><br><br>
We claim:-<br>
Wireless handheld polymorphic keyboard for physically handicapped, operated within 20 feet distance , through a single finger, without any add on card controlling all operations of a personal computer, compatible with the software Word Pad, Power Point and Excel running on windows platform with the provision for operation of television,   fan, light  and tape recorder.<br><br></td>
