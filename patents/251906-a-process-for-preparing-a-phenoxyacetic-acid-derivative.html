A phenol derivative represented by general formula (IV) can be prepared by treating 2.5-xylenol represented by formula (II) with a compound represented by general formula (III) in the presence of an aqueous solution of alkali metal hydroxide such as an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide. The amount of compound (III) and alkali metal hydroxide is used ordinarily in the range of about 1 to about 3 molar equivalents based on 1 mole of 2,5-xylenol (II). The reaction is ordinarily carried out at a temperature of about 10 to about 70° C for a period of 1 to 10 hours. After the reaction is finished, the reaction solution is neutralized with a dilute acid such as diluted hydrochloric acid. Thereafter, the precipitating crystals are<br>
filtered and dried to afford a phenol derivative of general formula (IV).<br>
(Step b)<br>
The phenol derivative (IV) is treated with a haloacetic acid ester of general formula (V) in the presence of a base in an inert solvent to afford a compound represented by general formula (VI) . The inert solvents employed in the reaction include ethers such as tetrahydrofuran or the like, ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone or the like, acetonitrile, N,N-dimethylformamide , N.N-dimethylacetamide or the like.

Haloacetic acid ester (V) includes ClCH2CO2R1, BrCH2 CO2R1 or ICH2CO2R1. The amount of haloacetic acid (V) and a base is used ordinarily in the range of about 1 to about 5 molar equivalents based on 1 mole of phenol derivative (IV). Haloacetic acid ester (V) and a base are ordinarily used in an equimolar ratio, but either of them may be used in excess. The reaction is carried out ordinarily at a temperature of about 0 to about 100° C for a period of 1 to 24 hours. After the reaction is finished, extraction of the reaction mixture and further concentration according to conventional procedures afford a compound of general formula (VI) .<br>
(Step c)<br>

The hydrolysis reaction is carried out ordinarily at a temperature of about 0 to about 50" C for a period of 0 . 5 to 24 hours. After the reaction is finished, extraction of the reaction mixture and further concentration according to conventional procedures afford an aldehyde derivative (VIII).<br>
(Step e)<br>
A hemiacetal derivative represented by general formula (I) of the present invention can be prepared by treating the aldehyde (VIII) with R2OH, optionally in the presence of an acid such as acetic acid or the like. The addition reaction of R2OH to the aldehyde derivative (VIII) proceeds rapidly, and the subsequent crystallization from a suitable solvent affords a hemiacetal derivative of general formula (I) .

(Figure Removed)<br><br><br><br>
wherein R1 and R2 are as defined above.<br>

Alternatively, the reaction can be carried out under a hydrogen atmosphere in the presence of a metal catalyst such as 5-10% palladium on carbon, Raney-N1, platinum oxide, palladium black, 10% platinum on carbon (sulfided) or the like. In the case of using alkali metal hydroboranes or boranes as a reducing agent, such reducing agent is used ordinarily in the range of about 0.5 to about 5 molar equivalents based on 1 mole of the hemiacetal derivative (I). The reaction is carried out ordinarily at a temperature of about 0 to about 60° C for a period of 1 to 48 hours. After the reaction is finished, if required, insoluble materials are filtered of f , and extraction of the reaction mixture and further concentration according to conventional procedures afford a phenoxyacetic acid derivative of general formula (X). Alternatively, the reaction can be carried out by treating an amine (IX) with an aldehyde of general formula (VIII) in place of a hemiacetal derivative (I) .<br>
The phenoxyacetic acid derivative (X) can be optionally converted to a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof according to conventional methods. Examples of such salts include acid addition salts formed with mineral acids<br>
such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid and the like; acid addition salts formed with organic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, methanasulfonicacid, benzenesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, propionic acid, citricacid, succinicacid, tartaric acid, fumaric acid, butyric acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid, maleic acid, lactic acid, malic acid, carbonic aid, glutamic acid, aspartic acid and the like.<br>
An amine represented by formula (IX) can be prepared by optically separating a commercially available enantiomeric mixture of the amine according to conventional methods. Alternatively, the amine (IX) can be prepared according to procedures as described in "J. Med. Chem., 1997, 20(7), p. 978-981".<br>
A compound represented by general formula (I) of the present invention, its intermediates (IV), (VI), (VII) and (VIII) as well as a phenoxyacetic acid derivative of general formula (X) can be optionally isolated or purified through standard isolation or purification techniques such as solvent extraction, recrystallization, chromatography and the like.<br>

INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
Via a hemiacetal derivative represented by general formula (I) of the present invention, a phenoxyacetic acid derivative of general formula(X) or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof can be prepared from a commercially available 2 , 5 -xylenol in high purities and through convenient procedures. Therefore, said hemiacetal derivative (I) is useful as a intermediate for preparing a medicament for treating or preventing obesity, hyperglycemia, diseases caused by intestinal hypermotility, pollakiuria,  urinary incontinence,  depression or biliary calculus.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	A process for preparing a phenoxyacetic acid derivative represented by general<br>
formula (X):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein R1 is a lower alkyl group, which comprises the step of treating a compound represented by general formula (I):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R1 is as defined above, and R2 is a lower alkyl group, with a compound represented by formula (IX) :<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in the presence of a reducing agent, and thereafter optionally forming a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of said compound (X), wherein the process is carried out at a temperature of 0 to about 60°C for a period of 1 to 48 hours.<br>
