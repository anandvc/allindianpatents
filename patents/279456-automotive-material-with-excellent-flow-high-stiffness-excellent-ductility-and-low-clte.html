				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention is directed to a new polypropylene composition, its use and preparation.<br>
Polypropylene is the material of choice in many applications as it can be tailored to specific purposes needed. For instance heterophasic polypropylenes are widely used in the automobile industry (for instance in bumper applications) as they combine good stiffness with reasonable impact strength behavior. Heterophasic polypropylenes contain a polypropylene matrix in which an amorphous phase is dispersed. The amorphous phase contains a propylene copolymer rubber, like an ethylene propylene rubber (EPR) or an ethylene propylene diene monomer polymer (EPDM). Further the heterophasic polypropylene may contain a crystalline polyethylene to some extent In the automotive industry such heterophasic polypropylenes grades contain an amount of about 30 wt.-% propylene copolymer rubber, which normally is produced directly in one or two gas phase reactors or added externally to the matrix via a compounding step. These materials are normally used in combination with 10 to 20 wt-% filler, like talcum, which overall leads to materials offering a good balance of stiffness and impact strength. However nowadays the automotive exterior parts become bigger and bigger and therefore excellent flowability is necessary to overcome high pressure during injection moulding. Another advantage of high flow materials is a reduction of cycle-time. Further there is an increasing demand to reduce the fuel consumption and thus weight reduction is a burning topic in the automotive industry. Weight reduction can be achieved with lower wall thickness, or material density. Lower wall thickness requires a higher stiffness. On the other hand the material has to have a high ductility at low temperatures to resist parking damages.<br>
Thus the object of the present invention is to provide a material which exhibits good stiffness and ductility paired with good processability, in particular in terms of high flowability. Further it is appreciated that the material has rather low coefficient of linear thermal<br>
expansion.<br>
<br>
The finding of the present invention is to add to a composition comprising a heterophasic polypropylene and a mineral filler, a further heterophasic material of higher melt flow.<br>
Thus the present invention is directed to a composition having a melt flow rate MFR2 (230 °C) measured according to ISO 1133 in the range of 10 to 50 g/l0min, said composition comprises a heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP1), a heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP2), a plastomer (P) and a mineral filler (F), wherein<br>
(a) the melt flow rate MFR2 (230 °C) measured according to ISO 1133 of the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP2) is higher than the melt flow rate MFR2 (230 oC) measured according to ISO 1133 of the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP1),<br>
(b) the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP1) has a melt flow rate MFR2 (230 °C measured according to ISO 1133 in the range of 3.0to 30.0 g/l0min and comprises (bl)     a matrix (Ml) being a propylene homopolymer and<br>
(b2)     an elastomeric copolymer (El) comprising units derived from propylene and ethylene and/or C4 to C20 a-olefin,<br>
(c)	the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP2) has a xylene cold soluble (XCS) content<br>
measured according to ISO 6427 in the range of 7.0 to 20,0 wt.-% and comprises<br>
(cl)     a ma:rix (M2) being a propylene homopolymer and<br>
(c2)      an elasti inreric copolymer (E2) comprising units derived from propylene and ethylene and/or C4 to C20 a-olefin, and<br>
(d)	the plastomer (P) is (chemically) different to the elastomeric copolymer (El) and to<br>
the elastomeric copolym.r (E2).<br>
More precisely the present invention is directed to a composition having a melt flow rate MFR2 (230 °C) meas m d.accding to ISO 1133 in the range of 10 to 50 g/10min,said composition comprises<br>
20 to 40 wt.-%, woferably 25 to 35 wt.-%, of a heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP1), 18 to 38 wt.-%,pre erably 23 to 33 wt.-%, of a heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP2), 12 lo 30 wt-%, jre:'erably 15 to 25 wt.-%, of a plastomeT (P) and<br>
<br>
     15 to 30 wt.-%, preferably 18 to 28 wt-%, of a mineral filler (F), based on the compes iticn, nore preferably based on the components H-PP1, H-PP2, P and F, wherein<br>
(a) the melt flow rate MFR2 (230 °C) measured according to ISO 1133 of the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP2) is higher than the melt flow rate MFR2 (230 °C) measured according to ISO 1133 of the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP1)<br>
(b) theheterophr.sk pdypropylene(H-PPl)hasameltflowrat MFR2(230°C) measured accordingto ISO 1133 in the range of 3.0 to 30.0 g/l0minand comprises (bl)     a matrix(Ml) being a propylene homopolymer and    <br>
(b2)      an eltonraric copolymer (El) comprising units derived from propylene and sthylene and/or C4 to C20 a-olefin,<br>

(d)	the plastomei (P) is (chemically) different to the elastomeric copolymer (El) and to<br>
the elastomeric copalymer (E2).<br>
It is apparent from th; worn.ing used for the different polymers (H-PP 1, H-PP2, E1, E2 and P) according to the presesnt invention that they must (chemically) differ from each other. The present invention is further characterized by the fact that neither the total composition nor its individual componen :s have been visbroken, for instance by using peroxide compounds. Also none of the polymers employed is branched. In other words all polymer used according to this invention have a branching index g' of at least 0.90, more preferably of at least 0.95, like of 1.00.<br>
In the expression "he erophasic" indicates that the elastomeric copolymers (El) and (E2) are (finely) dispersed in the matrix (Ml) and (M2), respectively. In other words the elastomeric<br>
<br>
copolymers (El) and (E2) form inclusions in the matrix (Ml) and (M2), respectively. Thus the matrix (M1) and Ml) contain (finely) dispersed inclusions being not part of the matrix and said inclusions contain the elastomeric copolymer (El) and (E2), respectively. The term "inclusion" according tc this invention shall preferably indicate that the matrix and the inclusion form different phases within the heterophasic polypropylene composition (H-PP1) or (H-PP2), said inclusions are for instance visible by high resolution microscopy, like electron microscopy or scaming force microscopy. The final composition is probably of a complex structure. Probably the matrix (Ml) and (M2) form a continuous phase being the matrix (M) of the conposition wherein the elastomeric copolymers (El) and (E2) and the plastomer (P) form together or individually inclusions dispersed therein.<br>
Additionally the inclusions of the final composition may also contain the mineral filler (F); however preferably the filler (F) forms separate inclusions within the matrix (M). In another embodiment the matrix( M) contains (finely) dispersed inclusions being not part of the matrix (M) and said inclusions contain the elastomeric copolymers (E1), (E2) and the plastomer (P). In such a case the plastomer (P) may preferably form on its part inclusions (finely dispersed) withir in the elastomeric copolymers.<br>
Further the compositian according to the present invention comprise preferably the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP1), the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP2), and the plastomer (P) as the (only polymer components within the composition, i.e. no other polymer components; are present.<br>
It has been surprising by found out that the composition according to this invention possess very good flowabilty by keeping the other properties, like stiffness and ductility, on the desired levels. In particu lar the flexural modulus, the impact at low temperatures and the coefficient of linear ther nal expansion fulfill the requirements set by the automobile industry (see table 2).<br>
The present inventior well be now described in more detail.<br>
<br>
One requirement is that the final composition has a rather high melt flow rate. The melt flow rate mainly depends on the average molecular weight. This is due to the fact that long molecules render the material a lower flow tendency than short molecules. An increase in molecular weight mains a decrease in the MFR-value. The melt flow rate (MFR) is measured in g/10 mir of the polymer discharged through a defined die under specified temperature and pressur conditions and the measure of viscosity of the polymer which, in turn, for each type of polymer is mainly influenced by its molecular weight but also by its degree of branching. The  melt flow rate measured under a load of 2.. 6 kg at 230 °C (ISO 1133) is denoted as MFR2 (230 °C). Accordingly, it is preferred that in the present invention the composition has an MFR2 (230 °C) in a range of 10.0 to 50.0 g/10 min, preferably of 15.0 to 40.0 g. 10 min, more preferably of 17.0 to 34.0 g/10 min, most preferably of 19.0 to 27.0 g/10min.<br>
Further, to obtain the desired melt flow properties of the composition the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP 1) and the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP2) must differ in some properties. Accordingly &gt;ne requirement is that the melt flow rate MFR2 (230 °C) of the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP2) is higher than the  melt flow rate MFR2 (230 °C) of the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP1). More specifically it is appreciated that the melt flow rate MFR2 (230 °C) of the beterophasic polypropylene (H-PP2) is at least 30 g/l0min, more preferably at least 50g/ 10min, higher than the melt flow rate MFRj (230 °C) of the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP1). Accordingly it is in particular appreciated that the ratio of the melt flow rate MFR2 (230 °C) of the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP 1) to the melt flow rate MFR2 (230 "C of the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP2) [MFR (H-PP1) / MFR (H-PP2)] is in the rang of 1:4 to 1:80, more preferably in the range of 1:5 to 1:50). But not only the meit flow ret: of the heterophasic systems as such shall differ but preferably also the melt flow rate of the matrixes part of the respective heterophasic systems. A heterophasic system is featured by a xylene cold soluble (XCS) fraction and a xylene cold insoluble (XCI) fraction. In the present application the xylene cold insoluble (XCI) fraction of a heterophasic polypropylene is essentially identical with the matrix of said heterophasic polypropylene. Accordingly when talking about the melt flow rate of the matrix of a heterophasic polypropylene the me t flow rate of the xylene cold insoluble (XCI) fraction of said<br>
<br>
heterophasic polypropylene is meant. Accordingly the melt flow rate MFR2 (230 °C) measured according to ISO 1133 of the xylene cold insoluble (XCI) fraction of the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP1) is lower, preferably at least 80 g/l0min lower, more preferably at least 100 g/l0nin lower, compared to the melt flow rate MFR2 (230 °C) measured according to ISO 1133 of the xylene cold insoluble (XCI) traction of the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP2).<br>
Additionally it has been recognized that especially suitable compositions are obtained in case also the xylene cold soluble (XCS) content of both heterophasic systems differ. Thus it is desired that the amount of xylene cold soluble (XCS) content of the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP1) measured according to ISO 6427 is higher, preferably at least 8.0 wt.-% higher, more preferably at least 11.0 wt.-% higher, compared to the xylene cold soluble (XCS) content of the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP2) measured according to ISO 6427. According y it is appreciated that following formula (I), preferably (Ia), is fulfilled<br>
XCS (H-PP1) ? 1.5 XCS (H-PP2)        (I)<br>
XCS(H-PP1) ?1.7XCS(H-PP2)	(la)<br>
wherein XCS (H-PP1)   is the xylene soluble content measured according to ISO 6427 given in<br>
            weight percentage of the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP1), and XCS (H-PP2)   is the xy eno soluble content measured according to ISO 6427 given in<br>
weight percentage of the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP2).<br>
To achieve a good balance between stiffness and ductility also the intrinsic viscosity of the xylene cold soluble (XCS) fraction of the two heterophasic polypropylenes shall differ. Thus it is appreciated that the intrinsic viscosity (IV) measured according to ISO 1268-1 (decalin) of the xylene cold soluble (XCS) fraction of the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP1) is higher compared to tb 5 intrhsic viscosity (IV) measured according to ISO 1268-1 (decalin) of the xylene cold soluble; (XCS) fraction of the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP2). More information about the inclhidual intrinsic viscosities of the two hitfn phasic polypropylenes is given below.<br>
<br>
Further it has been found out that especially good results are achievable in case the propylene content of the heerophasic polypropylene (H-PP2) is higher, at least 5.0 wt-% higher, compared to the propylene content of the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP1).<br>
The heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP1) is a typical material used in this technical field. Accordingly the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP1) has preferably a melt flow rate MFR2 (230 °C) in the range of 3.0 to 30.0 g/10min, more preferably in the range of 7.0 to 20.0 g/10min, still more preferably in the range of 9.0 to 15.0 g/10min.<br>
As stated above the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP1) according to this invention comprises<br>
(a) a matrix (Ml) being a propylene homopolyrner and<br>
(b) an elastomerie copolymer (El) comprising units derived from<br>
propylene and<br>
ethylene and/or C4 to C20 a-olefin.<br>
Preferably the propylene content in the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP1) is 75.0 to 92.0 wt.-%, more preferably 80.0 to 90.0 wt-%, based on the total heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP1), more prefers ibly based on amount of the polymer components of the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP ), yet more preferably based on the amount of me matrix (Ml) and the elastomeric copolymer (E1) together. The remaining part constitutes the comonomers, preferably ethylene.<br>
As defined herein a heter ophasic polypropylene (H-PP1) comprises as polymer components only the polypropylene matrix (Ml) and the elastomeric copolymer (El). In other words the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP1) may contain further additives but no other polymer in an amount exceeding 5 -wt-%, more preferably exceeding 3 wt-%, like exceeding 1 wt-%, based on the total hetercphaac polypropylene (H-PP1), more preferably based on the polymers present in the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP1). One additional polymer which may be present in such low amounts is a polyethylene which is a reaction product obtained<br>
<br>
by the preparation of the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP1). Accordingly it is in particular appreciated that a heter ophasic polypropylene (H-PP1) as defined in the instant invention contains only a polypropylene matrix (Ml), an elastomeric copolymer (El) and optionally a polyethylene in amounts as mentioned in this paragraph. Further, throughout the present invention the xylene cold insoluble (XCI) fraction represents the matrix (Ml) and optionally the polyethylene of the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP1) whsreas the xylene cold soluble (XCS) fraction represents the elastomeric part of the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP1), i.e. the elastomeric copolymer (El).<br>
Accordingly the matrix ( M1) content, Le. the xylene cold insoluble (XCI) content, in the heterophasic polypropylsne (H-PP1) is preferably in the range of 50.0 to 78.0 wt.-%, more preferably in the range of 55.0 to 75.0 wt.-%. In case polyethylene is present in the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP1), the values for the matrix (Ml) content but not for the xylene cold insoluble (XCI) content may be a bit decreased.<br>
On (he other hand the elastomeric copolymer (El) content, i.e. the xylene cold soluble (XCS) content, in the heter ophasic polypropylene (H-PP1) is preferably in the range of 22.0 to 50.0 wt.-%, more preferably in the range of 25.0 to 45.0 wt.-%.<br>
The expression propylene homopolymer used in the instant invention relates to a polypropylene that consists substantially, i.e. of more than 99.5 wt-%, still more preferably of at least 99.7 wt.-% like of at least 99.8 wt-%, of propylene units. In a preferred embodiment only propylene units in the propylene homopolymer are detectable. The comonomet content can be determined with FT infrared spectroscopy, as described below in the examples.<br>
The expression "mult modal" or "bimodal" used throughout the present invention refers to<br>
the modality of the polymer, i.e.<br>
the form of it; molecular weight distribution curve, which is the graph of the molecular weight fraction as a function of its molecular weight,<br>
and / or<br>
<br>
the form of i:s comonomer content distribution curve, which is the graph of the comonorner content as a function of the molecular weight of the polymer fractions.<br>
As will be explained below, the heterophasic polypropylenes as well their individual components (matrix and elastomeric copolymer) can be produced by blending different polymer types, i.e. of different molecular weight and/or comonomer content. However it is preferred that the heterophasic polypropylenes as well their individual components (matrix and elastomeric copolymer) are produced in a sequential step process, using reactors in serial configuration and operating at different reaction conditions. As a consequence, each fraction prepared in a specific reactor will have its own molecular weight distribution and/or comonomer content distribution<br>
The matrix (M1) of the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP1) being a propylene homopolymer can be multimodal or bimodal in view of the molecular weight.<br>
Further it is appreciated that the matrix (Ml) of the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP1) has a moderate melt flow MFR2 (230 °C). As stated above the melt flow rate MFR2 (230 °C) of the matrix (Ml) equates with the melt flow rate MFR2 (230 °C) of the xylene cold insoluble (XCI) fraction of the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP1). Thus it is preferred that the xylene cold insoluble (XCI) fraction of the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP1) has a melt flow rate MFR2 (2300 C) measured according to ISO 1133 of 20.0 to 150.0 g/l0min, more preferably of 25.0 to 90.0 g'l0min, still more preferably of 30.0 to 75.0 g/10 min.<br>
Preferably the polypropylene matrix (Ml) is isotactic. Accordingly it is appreciated that the polypropylene matrix (Ml) has a rather high pentad concentration, i.e. higher than 80 %, more preferably higher than 85 %, yet more preferably higher than 90 %, still more preferably higher thar. 92 %, still yet more preferably higher than 93 %, like higher than 95 %.<br>
The second component of the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP 1) is the elastomeric copolymer (El).<br>
<br>
The elastomeric copolymer (El) comprises, preferably consists of, units derivable from (i) propylene and (ii) ethylene and/or at least another C4 to C20 a-olefin, like C4 to C10 a-olefin, more preferably units derivable from (i) propylene and (ii) ethylene and at least another a-olefin selected; form the group consisting of 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-heptene and 1-octene. The elastomeric copolymer (El) may additionally contain units derived from a conjugated diene, like butadiene, or a non-conjugated diene, however it is preferred that the elastoraeric copolymer consists of units derivable from (i) propylene and (ii) ethylene and/or C4 to C20 a-olefins only. Suitable non-conjugated dienes, if used, include straight-chain and branched-chain acyclic dienes, such as 1,4-hexadiene, 1,5-hexadiene, 1,6-octadiene, 5-methyl-l, 4-hexadiene, 3,7-dimethyl-l,6-octadiene, 3,7-dimethyl-l,7-octadiene, and the mixed isomers of dihydromyrcene and dihydro-ocimene, and single ring alicycUc dienes such as 1,4-cyclohexadiene, 1,5-cyclooctadiene, 1,5-cyclododecadiene, 4-vinyl cyclohexene, l-allyl-4-isopropylidene cyclohexane, 3-aIlyl cyclopentene, 4-cyclchexene and l-isopropenyl-4-(4-butenyl) cyclohexane. Multi-ring alicyclic fused and bridged ring dienes are also suitable including tetrahydroindene, methyltctrahydroindcac, dicyclopentadiene, bicyclo (2,2,1) hcpta-2,5-dienc, 2-mcthyl bicyclohcptadicnc, and alkenyl, alkylidene, cycloalkenyl and cycloalkylidene norborncnes, such as 5-methylene-2-norbornene, 5-isopropylidene norbornene, 5-(4-cyclopentenyl)-2-norbornene; and 5-cyoloaexylidene-2-norbornene. Preferred non-cocjugated dienes are 5-ethylidene-2-norborn( roe, 1,4-hexadiene and dicyclopentadiene.<br>
Accordingly the elasto meric copolymer (El) comprises at least units derivable from propylene and ethylene and may comprise other units derivable from a further a-olefin as defined in the previous paragraph. However it is in particular preferred that elastomeric copolymer (El) comprif.es units only derivable from propylene and ethylene and optionally a conjugated diene, like butadiene, or a non-conjugated diene as defined in the previous paragraph, like 1,4-he sadiene. Thus an ethylene propylene non-conjugated diene monomer polymer (EPDM1) and/or an ethylene propylene rubber (EPR1) as elastomeric copolymer (El) is especially preferred, the latter most preferred.<br>
<br>
Like the matrix (Ml) the elastomeric copolymer (El) can be unimodal or multimodal, like bimodal, the latter being preferred Concerning the definition of unimodal and multimodal, like bimodal, it is referred to the definition above.<br>
In the present invention the content of units derivable from propylene in the elastomeric copolymer (EP1) equites with the content of propylene detectable in the xylene cold soluble (XCS) fraction. Accordingly the propylene detectable in the xylene cold soluble (XCS) fraction ranges from 50.0 to 75.0 wt.-%, more preferably 55.0 to 70.0 wt.-%. Thus in a specific embodiment the elastomeric copolymer (El), i.e. the xylene cold soluble (XCS) fraction, comprises from 25.0 to 50.0 wt.-%, more preferably 30.0 to 45.0 wt-%, units derivable from ethylene. Preferably the elastomeric copolymer (El) is an ethylene propylene non-conjugated diene monomer polymer (EPDM1) or an ethylene propylene rubber (EPR1), the latter especially preferred, with a propylene and/or ethylene content as defined in this paragraph.<br>
A further preferred requtrement of the present invention is that the intrinsic viscosity (IV) of the xylene cold solubl: (XCS) fraction of the hetcrophasic polypropylene (H-PP1) is rather high. Rather high values of intrinsic viscosity improve the impact strength. Accordingly it is appreciated that the intrinsic viscosity of the xylene cold soluble (XCS) fraction of the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP1) is above 2.5 dl/g, more preferably at least 2.8 dl/g, yet more preferably at least 3.0 dl/g, like at least 3.3 dl/g. On the other hand the intrinsic viscosity should be not too high otherwise the flowability is decreased Thus the intrinsic viscosity of the xylene cold soluble (XCS) fraction of the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP1) is preferably in the range of 2.5 to 4.5 dl/g, more preferably in the range 3.0 to 4.1 dl/g, still more pr;ferably 3.3to4.0 dl/g.

In another preferred embodiment the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP1) is BNT nucleated a; mentioned below.<br>
<br>
In the following the beterophasic polypropylene (H-PP2) is defined in more detail:<br>
The heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP2) is in particular featured by a rather high melt flow rate. Accordingly the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP2) has preferably a melt flow rate MFR2 (230 °C) in the range of 40.0 to 1000.0 g/l0min, more preferably in the range of 60.0 to 500.0 g/l0min, still more preferably in the range of 70 to 200 g/l0min.<br>

The remaining part constitutes the comonomers, preferably ethylene.<br>
Concerning the definition of a heterophasic polypropylene, see the information provided when discussing the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP1). Accordingly the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP2) comprises as polymer components only the polypropylene matrix (M2) and the elastomcric copolymer (E2). In other words the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP2) may contain further additives but no other polymer in an amount exceeding 5 wt-%, more preferably exceeding3 wt.-%, like exceeding 1 wt-%, based on the total heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP2), more preferably based on the polymers present in the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP2.). One additional polymer which may be present in such low amounts is a polyethylene which is a reaction product obtained by the preparation of the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP2). Accordingly it is in particular appreciated that a heterophasic<br>
<br>
polypropylene (H-PP2) as defined in the instant invention contains only a polypropylene matrix (M2), an elastomerio copolymer (E2) and optionally a polyethylene in amounts as mentioned in this paragraph. Further, throughout the present invention the xylene cold insoluble (XC1) fraction represents the matrix (M2) of the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP2) and optionally the polyethylene whereas the xylene cold soluble (XCS) fraction represents the elastoneric part of the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP2), i.e. the elastomeric copolymer (E2).<br>
Accordingly the matrix (M2) content, i.e. the xylene cold insoluble (XCI) content, in the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP2) is preferably in the range of 80.0 to 93.0 "wt-%, more preferably in the range cf 82.0 to 91.0 wt.-%, like 83.0 to 89.0 wt.-%. In case polyethylene is present in the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP2), the values for the matrix (M2) content but not for the xylene cold insoluble (XCI) content may be a bit decreased.<br>
On the other hand the elistomeric copolymer (E2) content, Le. the xylene cold soluble (XCS) content, in the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP2) is preferably in the range of 7.0 to 20.0 wt.-%, more preferably in the range of 9.0 to 18.0 wt-%, like 11.0 to 17.0 wt-%.<br>
The matrix (M2) of the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP2) being a propylene homopolymer can be multimodal or bimodal in view of the molecular weight, however it is preferred that the matrix (M2) is multimodal, like bimodal, in view of the molecular weight.<br>
Further and preferably the polypropylene matrix (M2) has a rather high melt flow rate. Accordingly, it is prefered that in the present invention the polypropylene matrix -(M2), Le. the xylene cold insoluble (XCI) fraction of the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP2), has an MFR: (230 °C) in a range of 100.0 to 1500.0 g/10 min, more preferably of 120.0 to 800.0 g/10 min, still rioe preferably of 150.0 to 500.0 g/10 min.<br>

<br>
preferably higher than 92 %, still yet more preferably higher than 93 %, like higher than 95 %.<br>
The second component of the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP2) is the elastomeric copolymer (E2).<br>
The elastomeric copolymer (E2) comprises, preferably consists of, units derivable from (i) propylene and (ii) ethylene and/or at least another C4 to C20 a-olefin, like C4 to C10 a-olefin, more preferably units derivable from (i) propylene and (ii) ethylene and at least another a-olefin selected form the group consisting of 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-heptene and 1-octene. The elastomeric copolymer (El) may additionally contain units derived from a conjugated diene, like butadiene, or a non-conjugated diene, however it is preferred that the elastomeric copolymer consists of units derivable from (i) propylene and (ii) ethylene and/or C4 to C20 a-olefins only. Suitable non-conjugated dienes, if used, include straight-chain and branched-chain acyclic dienes, such as 1,4-hexadiene, 1,5-hexadiene, 1,6-octadienc, 5-methyl-l, 4-hexadiene, 3,7-dimethyl-l,6-octadicne, 3,7-dimcthyl-l,7-octadiene, and the mixed isomers of dihydromyrcene and dmydro-ocimene, and single ring alicyclic dienes such as 1,4-cyclohexadiene, 1,5-cyclooctadiene, 1,5-cyclododecadiene, 4-vinyl cyclohexene, l-allyl-4-isopropylidene cyclohexane, 3-allyl cyclopentene, 4-cyclohexen3 and l-isopropenyl-4-(4-butenyl) cyclohexane. Multi-ring alicyclic fused and bridged ring dienes are also suitable including tetrahydroindene, methyltetrahydroindene, dicyelopentadiene, bicyclo (2,2,1) hepta-2,S-diene, 2-methyl bicycloheptadiene, and alkenyl, alkylidene, cycloalkenyl and cycloalkylidene norbornenes, such as 5-methylene-2 -norbornene, 5-isopropylidene norbornene, 5-(4-cyclopentenyl)-2-norbornene; and 5-cyclohexylidene-2-norbornene. Preferred non-conjugated dienes are 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene, 1,4-hexadiene and dkyelopentadiene.<br>
Accordingly the elastemeric copolymer (E2) comprises at least units derivable from propylene and ethylene and amy comprise other units derivable from a further a-olefin as defined in the previous paragraph. However it is in particular preferred that elastomeric copolymer (E2) compis es units only derivable from propylene and ethylene and optionally a<br>
<br>
conjugated diene, like butadiene, or a non-conjugated diene as defined in the previous paragraph, like 1,4-hexadiene. Thus an ethylene propylene non-conjugated diene monomer polymer (EPDM2) and/or an ethylene propylene rubber (EPR2) as elastomeric copolymer (E2) is especially preferred, the latter most preferred.<br>
Like the matrix (M2) the elastomeric copolymer (E2) can be unitnodal or multimodal, like bimodal. Concerning the definition of unimodal and multimodal, like bimodal, it is referred to the definition abovs.<br>
In the present invention the content of units derivable from propylene in the elastomeric copolymer (EP2) equates with the content of propylene detectable in the xylene cold soluble (XCS) fraction. Accordingly the propylene detectable in the xylene cold soluble (XCS) fraction ranges from 50.0 to 75.0 wt.-%, more preferably 55.0 to 70.0 wt.-%. Thus in a specific embodiment the elastomeric copolymer (E2), i.e. the xylene cold soluble (XCS) fraction, comprises from 25.0 to 50.0 wt.-%, more preferably 30.0 to 45.0 wt.-%, units derivable from ethylene. Preferably the elastomeric copolymer (E2) is an ethylene propylene non-conjugated diene monomer polymer (EPDM2) or an ethylene propylene rubber (EPR2), the latter especially preferred, with a propylene and/or ethylene content as defined in this paragraph.<br>
A further preferred raqurement of the present invention is that the intrinsic viscosity (IV) of the xylene cold soluble (XCS) fraction of the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP2) is rather low. Rather high values of intrinsic viscosity improve the ductility of the heterophasic system. Accordingly i: is appreciated that the intrinsic viscosity of the xylene cold soluble (XCS) fraction of the heteropbasic polypropylene (H-PP2) is below 3.0 dl/g, more preferably below 2.8 dl/g, yet mere preferably below 2.5 dl/g. Even more preferred the intrinsic viscosity of the xylene cold -soluble (XCS) fraction of the heterophasic polypropylene (H-PP2) is in the range of 1.8 tc 3.0 dl/g, more preferably in the range 1.9 to 2.8 dl/g, still more preferably 2.1 to 2.5 dl/g. The intrinsic viscosity is measured according to ISO 1628 in decaline at 135 °C.<br>
<br>
A further essential requirement is the present of a plastomer (P). The plastomer (P) is (chemically) different to the elastomeric copolymers (El) and (E2) of the heterophasic systems. More precisely the plastomer (P) is a linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE). Accordingly the plastomer (P), i.e. the linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), has a density measured according to ISO 1183-187 in the range 820 to 900 kg/m3, more preferably in the range of 850 to 900 kg/m3, yet more preferably in the range of 840 to 880 kg/m3, like in the range of 860 to 885 kg/m3)<br>
Further the plastomer (P), i.s. the linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), is featured by a specific melt flow rate, namely by a melt flow rate MFR2 (190 °C) measured according to ISO 1133 in the range of 3.0 to 15.0 g/10min, more preferably in the range of 4.0 to 10.0 g/l0min.<br>
Preferably the plastomer (P), i.e. the linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), is a copolymer containing as a major part units derivable from ethylene. Accordingly it is appreciated that the plastomsr (P), i.e. the linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), comprises at least 50.0 wt-% units derivable from ethylene, more preferably at least 55.0 wt.-% of units derived from ethylene. Thus it is appreciated that the plastomer (P), i.e. the linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), comprises 50.0 to 70.0 wt.-%, more preferably 55.0 to 65 wt.-%, units derivable from ethylene. The comonomers present in the plastomer (P), i.e. the linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), are C4 to C20 a-olefms, like 1 -butene, 1-hexene and 1-octene, the latter especially preferred. Accordingly in one specific embodiment the plastomer (P), i.e. the linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), is an ethylene-1 -octene polymer with the amounts given in this paragraph.<br>
As a further requirement the present composition requires the presence of a mineral filler (F). Preferably the mineral filler (F) is a phyllosilicate, mica or wollastonite. Even more preferred the mineral filler (F) is selected from the group consisting of mica, wollastonite, kaolinite, smectite, montmorillo lite and talc. The most preferred the mineral filler (F) is talc.<br>
<br>
The mineral filler (F) preferably has a particle size (d97%) of below 10.0 urn (d97% indicates that 97 wt-% of the filler has a particle size below 10.0 urn), more preferably below 7.0 µm.<br>
Typically the mineral filler (F) has a surface area measured according to the commonly known BET method with N2 gas as analysis adsorptive of less than 20 m2/g, more preferably of less than 15 m2/g, yet more preferably of less than 10 m2/g. In some embodiments, the mineral filler (F) shows a surface area of 7 m2/g or less. Mineral fillers (F) fulfilling these requirements are preferably anisotropic mineral fillers (F), like talc, mica and wollastonite. An especially preferred filler is talc.<br>
The instant composition may additional contain typical other additives useful in the automobile sector, like carbon black, other pigments, antioxidants, UV stabilizers, nucleating agents, antistatic agents and slip agents, in amounts usual in the art.<br>
All components used for the preparation of the instant composition are known. Accordingly also their preparation is well known. For instance the heterophasic polypropylenes according to this invention arc preferably produced in a multistage process known in the art, wherein the matrix is produced at least in one slurry reactor and subsequently the elastomeric copolymer is produced at least in one gas phase reactor.<br>
Thus, the polymerization system can comprise one or more conventional stirred slurry reactors and/or one or rtore gas phase reactors. Preferably the reactors used are selected from the group of loop and gas phase reactors and, in particular, the process employs at least one loop reactor and at least one gas phase reactor. It is also possible to use several reactors of each type, e.g. one loop and two or three gas phase reactors, or two loops and one or two gas phase reactors, in seri.s.<br>
Preferably the process comprises also a prepolymerization with the chosen catalyst system, as described in detail below, comprising the Ziegler-Natta procatalyst, the external donor and the cocatalyst.<br>
<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the prepolymerisation is conducted as bulk slurry polymerisation in liquid propylene, i.e. he liquid phase mainly comprises propylene, with minor amount of other reactants and optionally inert components dissolved therein.<br>
The prepolymerisation reaction is typically conducted at a temperature of 0 to 50 °C, preferably from 10 to 45 °C, and more preferably from 15 to 40 °C.<br>
The pressure in the prepolymerisation reactor is not critical but must be sufficiently high to maintain the reaction mixture in liquid phase. Thus, the pressure may be from 20 to 100 bar, for example 30 to 70 bar.<br>
The catalyst components are preferably all introduced to the prepolymerisation step. However, where the solid catalyst component (i) and the cocatalyst (ii) can be fed separately it is possible that only a part of the cocatalyst is introduced into the prepolymerisation stage and the remaining part into subsequent polymerisation stages. Also in such cases it is necessary to inrroduce so much cocatalyst into the prepolymerisation stage that a sufficient polymerisation reaction is obtained therein.<br>
It is possible to add ovher components also to the prepolymerisation stage. Thus, hydrogen may be added into the prepolymerisation stage to control the molecular weight of the prepolymer as is known in the art. Further, antistatic additive may be used to prevent the particles from adhering ro each other or to the walls of the reactor.<br>
The precise control of the prepolymerization conditions and reaction parameters is within the skill of the art.<br>
A slurry reactor designates any reactor, such as a continuous or simple batch stirred tank reactor or loop reactor, operating in bulk or slurry and in which the polymer forms in particulate form. "Bulk" means a polymerization in reaction medium that comprises at least<br>

Preferably the heterophasic polypropylene composition according to this invention are produced by using a special Ziegler-Natta procatalyst in combination with a special external donor, as described below in detail, preferably in the Spheripol® or in the Borstar*-PP process.<br>
One preferred multistage process may therefore comprise the steps of:<br>
producing a polypropylene matrix in the presence of the chosen catalyst system, as for instance described in detail below, comprising the special Ziegler-Natta procatalyst (i), an external donor (iii) and the cocatalyst (ii) in a first slurry reactor and optionally in a: econd slurry reactor, both slurry reactors using the same polymerization conditions,<br>
<br>

In one embodiment, the avers ge residence time in the slurry reactor, for example a loop reactor, is in the range of from 0.5 to 5 hours, for example 0.5 to 2 hours, while the average-residence time in the gas phase reactor generally will be from 1 to 8 hours.<br>
If desired, the polymerization may be effected in a known manner under supercritical conditions in the slurry, preferably loop reactor, and/or as a condensed mode in the gas phase reactor.<br>
