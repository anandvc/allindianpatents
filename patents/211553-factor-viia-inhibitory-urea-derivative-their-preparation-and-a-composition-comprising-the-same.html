Factor Vila inhibitory (thio)urea derivatives, their preparation and their use<br><br>
in which R\ R2, R3, R4, Rs, R6, A, X, m and n have the meanings indicated below. The compounds of the formula I are valuable pharmacologically active compounds. They exhibit a strong antithrombotic effect and are suitable, for example, for the therapy and prophylaxis of thromboembolic diseases and restenoses. They are reversible inhibitors of the blood clotting enzyme factor Vila and car* in genera] be applied in conditions in which an undesired activity of factor Vila is present cr for the cure or prevention of which an inhibition of factor Vila is intended. The invention furthermore relates to processes for the preparation of compounds of the formula I, their use, in particular as active ingredients in pharmaceuticals, and pna,7TiaceuiicaJ preparations comprising them.<br>
The ability to form blood clots is vital to survival. The fcrrr.aticn cf a ricec c:ci cr a thrombus is normally the result of tissue injury which initiates the ocecdsiicr. cascade and has the effect of slowing or preventing biccd flow in wound healing. Other factors which are not directly related to tissue injury like atherosclerosis and inflammation may also initiate the coagulation cascade. In general, a relationship exists between inflammation and the coagulation cascade. Inflammation mediators regulate the coagulation cascade and coagulation components influence the production and activity of inflammation mediators. However, in certain disease states the formation of blood clots within the circulatory system reaches an undesired extent and is itself the source of morbidity potentially leading to pathological consequences*<br><br>
It is nevertheless not desirable in such disease states to completely inhibit the blood clotting system because life threatening hemorraghe would ensue. In the treatment of such states a well-balanced intervention into the blood clotting system is required, and there is still a need for substances exhibiting a suitable pharmacological activity for achieving such a result.<br>
Bleed coagulation is a complex process involving a progressively amplified series of enzyme activation reactions in which plasma zymogens are sequentially activated by limited proteolysis. Mechanistically the blood coagulation cascade has been divided into intrinsic and extrinsic pathways, which converge at the activation of factor X; subsequent generation of thrombin proceeds through a single common pathway (see Scheme 1). Present evidence suggests that the intrinsic pathway plays an important role :r. the maintenance and growth of fibrin formation, while the extrinsic pathway is critical in the initiation phase of blood coagulation (H. Cole, Aust J. Med. Sci. 16 (1995; 37; G. J. Eroze, Bleed Coagulation and Fibrinolysis 6, Suppl. 1 (1995) S7). It is generally accepted that blood coagulation is physically initiated upon formation of a factor Vila/tissue factcr(TF) complex. Once formed, this complex rapidly initiates coagulation by activating factors IX and X, The newly generated activated factor X, I e. factor Xa; then forms a one-to-one complex with factor Va and phospholipids to form a crcthrcmbinase complex, which is responsible for converting soluble fibrir.ccen to insoluble fibrin via the activation of thrombin from its precursor prothrombin. As time progresses, the activity of the factor Vila/tissue factor complex (ext™s;c pathway) is suppressed by a Kunrtz-type protease inhibitor protein, TFPI, whicr wren ccmplexec to factor Xa, can directly inhibit the proteolytic activity of factor V!!a;t:ssue factor, in order to maintain the coagulation process in the presence of an inhibited extrinsic system, additional factor Xa is produced via the thrombin-mediated activity of the intrinsic pathway. Thus, thrombin plays a dual<br><br><br>
Scheme 1: Eiccc coagulation cascade<br>
autocatalytic role, — eclsrnc its own production and the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. The autocataySc nature cf thrombin generation is an important safeguard against uncontrolled bieedlnc and it ensures that, once a given threshold level of prothrombinase is present blood coagulation will proceed to completion. Thus, it is most desirable iz devs'cc agents tnai inhibit coagulation without directly inhibiting thrombin but by inhibiting ether steps in the coagulation cascade like factor Vila activity.<br>
In many clinical applications there is a great need for the prevention of intravascular blood clots or for some anticoagulant treatment. For example, nearly 50 % of patients who have undergone a total hip replacement develop deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The currently available drugs like heparin and derivatives thereof are not satisfactory in many specific clinical applications. The currently approved therapies include fixed dose low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and variable dose heparin. Even with<br><br>
these drug regimes 10 % to 20 % of patients develop DVT, and 5 % to 10 % develop bleeding complications.<br>
Another clinical situation for which better anticoagulants are needed concerns subjects undergoing transluminal coronary angioplasty and subjects at risk for myocardial infarction or suffering from crescendo angina. The present, conventionally accepted therapy which consists of administering heparin and aspirin, is associated with a 6 % to 8 % abrupt vessel closure rate within 24 hours of the procedure. The rate of bleeding complications requiring transfusion therapy due to the use of heparin aiso is approximately 7 %. Moreover, even though delayed closures are significant, administration of heparin after termination of the procedures is of little value and can be detrimental.<br>
The widely used blood-clotting inhibitors like Heparin and related sulfated polysaccharides like LMVVH and heparin sulfate exert their anti-clotting effects by promoting the binding of a natural regulator of the clotting process, anti-thrombin III, tc thrombin and to factor Xa. The inhibitory activity of heparin primarily is directed toward thrombin which is inactivated approximately 100 times faster than factor Xa. Hirudin and hirulog are two additional thromfcin-specific anticoagulants presently in ciinicai trials. However, these anticoagulants which inhibit thrombin also are associated with bleeding complications. Preclinical studies in baboons and dogs have shewn that targeting enzymes involved at earlier stages of the coagulation cascade, such as factor Xa or factor Vila, prevents cic-t formation without producing the bleeding side effects observed with direct thrombin inhibitors (L. A. Harker et ah, Tnrornfc. naernostas. 74 (1995) 464).<br>
Specific inhibition of the factor Vila/tissue factor catalytic complex using monoclonal antibodies (cf. WO-A-92/06711) or a protein such as chloromethy! ketone inactivated factor Vila (cf, WO-A-96/1280Q or-WO-A-97/47651) is an extremely effective means of controlling thrombus formation caused by acute arterial injury or the thrombotic complications related to bacterial septicemia. Tnere is also experimental evidence suggesting that inhibition of factor Vila/tissue factor activity inhibits restenosis<br><br>
following balloon angioplasty (L A. Harker et ah, Haemostasis 26 (1996) S1:76). Bleeding studies have been conducted in baboons and indicate that inhibition of the factor Vila/tissue factor complex has the widest safety window with respect to therapeutic effectiveness and bleeding risk of any anticoagulant approach tested including thrombin, platelet and factor Xa inhibition (L A. Harker et alM Thromb. Haernostas. 74 (1995) 464),<br>
A specific inhibitor of factor Vila which has a favorable property profile would have substantial practical value in the practice of medicine. In particular, a factor Vila inhibitor would be effective under circumstances where the present drugs of choice, like heparin and related sulfated polysaccharides, are ineffective or only marginally effective. Certain inhibitors of factor Vila have already been described. EP-A-987274, for example, discloses compounds containing a tripeptide unit which inhibit factor Vila. However, the property profile of these compounds is still not ideal, and there is a need for further low molecular weight factor VIla-specific blood clotting inhibitors that are effective and do not cause unwanted side effects. The present invention satisfies this need by providing novel factor Vila activity inhibiting urea derivatives and thiourea derivatives of the formula I. Other (thio)urea derivatives have already beer, cescribed, for example, in US-A-5314902 (corresponding to WO-A-94/17041) and US-A-5703G50 (corresponding to WO-A-94/22907), however, the disclosed ccnpcuncs are antagonists of integrin receptors like the fibrinogen receptor<br>

Thus, a subject cf the present invention are compounds of the formula I,<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
one another have the meanings indicated, and can in each case be identical or different.<br>
As used herein, the term alkyi is to be understood in the broadest sense to mean hydrocarbon residues which can be linear, i. e. straight-chain, or branched and which can be acyclic or cyclic groups or comprise any combination of acyclic and cyclic subunits. Further, the term alkyi as used herein expressly includes saturated groups as well as unsaturated groups which latter groups contain one or more, for example one, two or three, double bonds and/or triple bonds, provided that the double bonds are not located within a cyclic alkyi group in such a manner that an aromatic system results. Ai! these statements also apply if an alkyi group occurs as a substituent on another group or is substituted, for example in an alkoxy group (aikyl-O), an alkoxycarbcry^ croup or an arylalkyl- group. Examples of alkyi groups containing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8,10,11 or 12 carbon atoms are methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, perrtyi, hexyl, hepty". cctyi? nonyl, decyl, undecyl, dodecyl, the n-isomers of ail these groups, isopropyl, ISCCUT/?, 1-methyibutyl, isopentyl, neopentyl, 2,2-dimethylbutyl( 2-methylpentyi S-nr-ethyip^ntyl, ischexyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, tert-pentyl, 2,3,4-trimethylhexyi. isocecyt.<br>
Unsaturated alkyi groups are, for example, alkenyl groups such as vinyl, 1-propenyL 2-propenyl •■= ally!}. 2-outenyi, 3-butenyI, 2-methy(-2-butenyl) 3-methyI-2-buteny!, £-hexenyl or : JB-penTailenyl, cr alkynyi groups such as ethynyl, 1-propynyI, 2-propy^y* (= proparcyf, cr 2-£'Jt/r:yi. AJkyi croups can also be unsaturated when they are substitutec.<br>
Examples of cyclic alkyi groups are cycioalkyi groups containing 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 ring carbon atoms like cycicpropyl, cyciobutyi, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl or cyclooctyl which can also be substituted and/or unsaturated. Unsaturated cyclic alkyi groups and unsaturated cycioalkyi'groups like, for example, cyclopentenyi or cyclohexenyl can be bonded via any carbon atom. The term alkyi as used herein also comprises cycioalkyi-substituted alkyi groups like cyclopropylmethyl-, cyciobutylmethyK cydopentylmethyK cyclohexylmethyh cycloheptylrnethyl-, 1-<br><br>
cyclopropylethyh 1-cyclobutylethyh 1-cyclopentyIethyl-, 1-cyclohexylethyI-, 2-cyclopropylethyl-, 2-cyc(obutyiethy(-, 2-cyclopentyiethyl-, 2-cyclohexyIethyl-, 3-cyclopropylpropyh 3-cyclobutyIpropyl-, 3-cyclopentylpropyl- etc. in which groups the cycloalkyi subgroup as well as the acyclic subgroup can be unsaturated and/or !   substituted.<br>
Of course, a cyclic alkyl group has to contain at least three carbon atoms, and an unsaturated alkyl group has to contain at least two carbon atoms. Thus, a group like (CrC5)-a!kyI is to be understood as comprising, among others, saturated acyclic (d-C3)-alkyl, (Cs-Cs^cycloalkyl, cycioaikyl-aikyl- groups like (C3-C7)H:ycioalkyl-(CrC3}-alkyl- wherein the total number of carbon atoms can range from 4 to 8, and unsaturated (C2-C8)-a!kyl like (C2-C3)-a!kenyi or (C2-Ca)-alkynyl. Similarly, a group like (C-C;}-a!kyi is to be understood as comprising, among others, saturated acyclic (CrC4)~aikyI, (QrC^-cycloalkyl, cyciccrcpyi-methyl- and unsaturated (C2-C4)-aIky! like (CrCd)-a!k9nyl or (CrC4)-aIkynyL<br>
Unless staled otherwise, in one embodiment of the invention the term alkyl comprises acyclic saturated hydrocarbon residues which have from one to six carbon atoms and which can be linear or branched. A particular group of saturated acyclic alkyl groups is formed by (C-,-C*}-=ikyi groups like methyl, ethyl, rvpropyl, isopropyl, n-buty!r isobutyL sec-butyl and ten-butyl.<br>
. The above statements relating to aiky! grc-jps cc not only apply to monovalent residues r-tii correspondingly to divalent arc polyvalent residues like alkanediyl groups, alkylene groups or polymsthy'ene croups examples of which are methylene, 1,2-ethyiene (= ethane-l,2-diyl), 1,1-ethytene (= 1-methyI-methyIene), 1-isobutyl-methylene, 1,3-propyfene, 2,2-dirnethyM ,3-prGpyiene, 1,4-buty!ene, but-2-en-1,4-diyl, 1,2-cyclopropyiene, 1,2-cyciohexylene, 1,3-cyclohexyIeneor 1,4-cyciohexyIene.<br>
Examples of (Ci-C4)-aIkoxy-(C2-C4)-alkoxy- groups are 2-methoxyethoxy-, 2-ethoxyethoxy-, 2-isopropoxyethoxy-, 3-methoxypropoxy- or 4-ethoxybutoxy-.<br><br>
The term aryl refers to a monocyclic or poiycyclic hydrocarbon residue in which residue at least one carbocyclic ring is present which has a conjugated pi electron system, i. e., which is an aromatic ring, and which residue is attached via a carbon atom contained in a ring which has a conjugated pi electron system. In a (C6-Ci4)-aryI group from 6 to 14 ring carbon atoms are present. Examples of (C6-C14)-aryl groups are phenyl, naphthyi, biphenylyl, fiuorenyl, anthracenyl, indenyl, indanyl, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthyl or 2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-benzocycloheptenyl. Examples of (C6-Cio)-aryl groups are phenyl, naphthyi, indenyl, indanyl or 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthyl. Unless stated otherwise, and irrespective of any specific substituents bonded to ary! groups which are indicated in the definition of the compounds of the formula I, aryl groups, for example phenyl, naphthyi or fiuorenyl, can in general be unsubstituted or substituted by one or more, for example one, two, three or four, identical or different substituents, for example by the substituents listed below.<br>
AP/I groups can be bonded via any desired position in an aromatic ring. In substituted aryl groups the substituents can be located in any desired position. In mcnosubstituted phenyl groups the substituent can be located in the 2-position, the 3-position or the 4-position, with the 3-position and the 4-position being preferred. If a phenyl group carries two substituents, they can be located in 2,3-pos'rtion, 2,4-position, 2,5-position, 2,6-position, 3,4-position or 3,5-position. In phenyl groups carrying three substituents the substituents can be located in 2,3,4-position, 2,3,5-pcsiiicn, 2,3,6-pcsition, 2,4,5-position, 2,4,6-position, or 3,4,5-pcsrticn. Naphthyi groups can be 1-naphthyi (= naphthalen-1-y!) and 2-naphthyl (- naphthaIen-2-yl). In substituted naphthyi groups the substituents can be located in any positions, for example in monosubstituted 1-naphthyi groups in the 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7-, op¬position and in monosubstituted 2-naphthyl groups in the 1-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7-, or 8-position, 1,2,3,4-Tetrahydronaphthyl, when attached via a carbon atom in the aromatic ring and comprised by the term aryl, can be 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalen-S-y! or 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthaIen-e-yI. Biphenylyl groups can be biphenyl-2-yi, biphenyI-3-yl or biphenyl-4-yl. Fiuorenyl groups, when comprised by the term aryl, can be bonded via the 1-, 2-7 3- or 4-position, otherwise via the 1-, 2-, 3-, 4- or 9-<br><br>
position. In monosubstituted fluorenyl groups bonded via the 9-position the substituent is preferably present in the 1-, 2-, 3- or 4-position.<br>
The above statements relating to aryl groups correspondingly apply to divalent and polyvalent groups derived from aryl groups, e. g. to an/fene groups like phenyiene which can be unsubstituted or substituted 1,2-phenylene, 1,3-phenylene or 1,4-phenyiene, or naphthylene which can be unsubstituted or substituted 1,2-naphthalenediyl, 1,3-naphthalenediyl, 1,4-naphthaienediyl, 1,5-naphthaienediyI, 1,6-naphthaienediyi, 1,7-naphthalenediyl, 1,8-naphthalenediyI, 2,3-naphthalenediyl, 2,6-naphthalenediyl or 2,7-naphthaIenediyi. The above statements also correspondingly apply to the aryl subgroup in arylalkyl- groups. Examples of arylalkyl- groups which can also be unsubstituted or substituted in the aryl subgroup as well as in the alkyi subgroup, are benzyl, 1-phenyIethyl, 2-phenytethyl, 1-phenylpropyi, 2-phenyiprc-pyf, 3-phenylpropyi, 1-phenylbutyl, 4-phenyIbutyI, 1-methyI-3-phenyf-propyl, 1-naphthylmeihyl, 2-naphthylmethyl, 1-(1-naphthyl)ethyt, 1-(2-naphtiiyi)eihyl, 2-(l-naphthyl)ethyl, 2-(2-naphthyl)ethyl or 9-fluorenylmefhyl. AH the above explanations also corresponding apply to aromatic rings which may be condensed (or fused) to a ring formed by the groups R4 and R3 and the carbon atom to which these creeps are attached.<br>
The He? group comprises groups containing 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, S. 5 or 10 ring &amp;zr£ in the parent monocyclic or bicyciic heterocyclic ring system. In monocyclic net grcups the heterocyclic ring preferably is a 3-membered, 4-membered, 5-membered 5-membered or 7-membered ring, particularly preferably a 5-membered or 5-membered ring. In bicyciic Het groups preferably two fused rings are present one of which is a 5-membered ring or 6-membered heterocyclic ring and the other of which is a 5-membered or 6-membered heterocyclic or carbocyclic ring. I. eM a bicyciic ring Het preferably contains 8, 9 or 10 ring atoms, particularly preferably 9 or 10 ring atoms,<br>
Het comprises saturated heterocyclic ring systems which do not contain any double bonds within the rings, as well as unsaturated heterocyclic ring systems including<br><br>
mono-unsaturated and poly-unsaturated heterocyclic ring systems which contain one or more, for example one, two, three, four or five, double bonds within the rings provided that the resulting system is stable. Unsaturated rings may be partially unsaturated or non-aromatic, or they may be aromatic, i. e. double bonds within the rings in the Het group may be arranged in such a manner that a conjugated pi electron system results. Aromatic rings in a Het group may be 5-membered or 6-membered rings, i. e. aromatic groups in a Het group contain 5 to 10 ring atoms. Aromatic rings in a Het group thus comprise 5-membered and 6-rnembered monocyclic heterocycles and bicyciic heterocycies composed of two 5-membered rings, one 5-membered ring and one 6-membered ring, or two 6-rnembered rings. In bicyciic aromatic groups in a Het group one or both rings may contain heteroatoms. Aromatic Het groups may also be referred to by the customary term heteroaryl for which all the definitions and explanations above and beiow relating to Het correspondingly apply. These explanations relating to the saturation/unsaturation ir&gt; heterocyclic ring systems representing the Het group corresponding apply to any other heterocyclic ring sysiem that can be present in a compound of the formula I, for example to a ring formed by R* and R3 together with the carbon atom to which these groups are bonded, and the ring systems that may be condensed to this ring.<br>
In a Het group and any ether heterocyclic group preferably 1 or 2 identical or different ring heteroatoms selectee rem nitrogen, oxygen and sdfur atoms are present In general, the ring hetercairms can be present in any cesred combination and in any desired positions with respect to each ether provided thai the resulting heterocyclic system is known in the art and is stable and suitable as a subgroup in a drug substance. Examples of parent structures of heterocycies from which the Het group any other heterocyclic groups can be derived are aziricine, cxirane, azetidlne, pyrrole, furan, thiophene, cloxoie, imidazole, pyrazole, cxazole, isoxazoie, thiazole, isothiazoie, 1,2,3-triazoIe, 1,2,4-triazcle, pyridine, pyran, thicpyran, pyridazine, pyrimidine, pyrazine, 1,4-dioxine, 1,2-cxazine, 1,3-oxazine, 1,4-oxazine, 1,2-thiazine, 1,3-thiazine, 1,4-thiazine, 1:2:3-triazine, 1,2,4-triazine, 1,3,5-triazine, azepine, 1,2-diazepine, 1,3-diazepine, 1,4-diazepine, indole, isoindole, benzofuran, benzothiophene, 1,3-benzodioxcie, benzo[1,4]dioxine, 4H-benzo[1,4]oxazine,<br><br>
indazole, benzimidazole, benzoxazole, benzothiazoie, quinoline, isoquinoline, ' chromane, isochromana, cinnoline, qufnazoline, quinoxaline, phthafazin^, pyridoimldazoles, pyridopyridines, pyridopyrimidines, etc. as well as ring systems which result from the listed heterocycles by fusion (or condensation) of a carbocyclic 5   ring, for example benzo-fused, cyclopenta-fused, cyclohexa-fused or cydohepta-fused derivatives of these heterocycles.<br>
The fact that many of the before-listed names of heterocycles are the chemical names of unsaturated or aromatic ring systems does not imply that the Het groups and other heterocyclic groups could only be derived from the respective unsaturated ring system. The names here only serve to describe the ring system with respect to ring size and the number of the heteroatoms and their relative positions. As explained above, for example a Het group can be saturated or partially unsaturated or aromatic, and can thus be derived not only from the before-listed heterocycles themselves but also from all their partially or completely hydrogenated analogues and also from their more highly unsaturated analogues if applicable. As examples of completely or partially hydrogenated analogues of the before-listed heterocycles from which a Het group and any other heterocyclic group may be derived the following may be mentioned: pyrroline, pyrrolidine, tetrahydrofuran, tetrahydrothiophene, dihydropyridine, tetrahydropyridine, piperidine, 1,3-dioxoIane, 2-imi'dazoline, imidazoline, 4,5-dihydro-1,3-oxazoie, 1,3-oxazoiidine, 4,5-dihydro-l,3-thjazoIe, 1,3-thiazolidine, perhydro-1,4-dioxine (=1,4-dioxane), piperazine, perhydrol,4-oxazine (- morpholine), 2,3-dihydrobenzo[1,4]dicxine (= 1,4-benzodioxane), 3,4-dihydro2K-benzo[1,4]oxazine, perhydn&gt;l,4-thiazine (= thiomorpholine), perhydroazepine, indoline, isoindoline, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoIine, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquincline, etc.<br>

Similarly benzimidazolyl, benzoxazolyl and benzothiazolyl groups can be bonded via the 2-position and via any of the positions 4, 5, 6, and 7, and in the case of benzimidazolyl also via the 1-position. Quinolinyl can be quinoIin-2-yl, quinolin-3-y!, quinclin-4-yl, quirciin-S-yi, quinolin-6-yl, quinoiin-7-yl orquinolin-8-yl, isoqinolinyi can be isoquinolin-1-yl, isoquinoIin-3-yI, isoquinoIin-4-yl, isoquinolin-5-yI, isoquinoIin-6-yl, isocuincun-7-y! or isoquinolin-8-yL In addition to being bonded via any of the positions indicated for quinolinyl and isoquinolinyl, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydrcquinoIinyI and 1,2.3:-i-tstrahycrciscqL'ir.oIinyI can also be bonded via the nitrogen atoms in 1-pcsScn and 2-pcsrtion, respectively.<br>

Further, unless stated otherwise, and irrespective of any specific substituents in Het groups or any other heterocyclic groups which are indicated in the definition of the compounds of the formula I, Het groups and other heterocyclic groups can on each suitable ring nitrogen atom independently of one another be unsubstituted, i. e. carry a hydrogen atom, or be substituted, for example, by (CrC8)-aIkyi, for example (Cr Ci)-alkyl such as metnyi or eihyi, optionally substituted phenyl, phenyKCrC^alkyl-, for example benzyl, optionally substituted in the phenyl group, hydroxy-(C2-C4)-alkyi-such as, for example 2-nycL^/etnyI, acetyl or another acyl group, methylsulfonyl or another sulfony! crcLr, etc. Another group that may occur as a substituent on a suitable ring nitrogen atom is the acetimino group CH3-C(=NH)-- Suitable nitrogen heterocycfes can also be prEsanr as N-oxides or as quaternary salts. Ring sulfur atoms can be cxidcac to the sulfoxide or to the sulfone. Thus, for example, a tetrahydrothienyl residue may be present as S,S-dioxotetrahydrothienyl residue or a thiomorpholiny! j-yl may be present as 1-oxo-<br>
thiomorphoiin- <br>
The explanations reiEifrg iz the Het group correspondingly apply to divalent and polyvalent Het creeps z^uar.g orient and polyvalent heteroaromatic groups which may be bonded via any ring carbon atoms and in the case of nitrogen heterocycles via any carbon atoms and any suitable ring nitrogen atoms or via any suitable ring nitrogen atoms. For example, a pyridinediyl group can be pyridin-2,3-diyl, pyridin-2,4-diyl, pyridin^S-diyi, pyridin-2,6'diylf pyridin-3,4-diyl or pyridin-3f5-diyl, a piperidinediyl group can be, among others, piperidin-1,2-diyl, piperidin-1,3-diyl, piperidin-1,4-diyI, pipencin-2)3-diyi, piperidin-2t4-diy! or p]peridin-3,5-diyl, a piperazinediyl group can be, among others, piperazin-1,3-diyI, piperazin-1,4-diyl,<br><br>

Halogen is fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine, preferably fluorine, chlorine or bromine.<br>
Optically active carbon atoms present in the compounds of the formula I can independently of each other have R configuration or S configuration. The compounds of the formula I can be present in the form of pure enantiomers or pure diastereomers or in the form of mixtures of enantiomers and/or diastereomers, for example in the form of racemates. The present invention relates to pure enantiomers and mixtures of enantiomers as well as to pure diastereomers and mixtures of diastereomers. The invention comprises mixtures of two or of more than two stereoisomers of the formula 1, and it comprises all ratios of the stereoisomers in the mixtures. In case the compounds of the formula I can be present as E isomers or Z isomers (or cis isomers or trans isomers) the invention relates both to pure E isomers and pure Z isomers and to E/Z mixtures in all ratios. The invention also comprises all tautomeric forms of the compounds of the formula I, for example the form in which instead of the group R1-NH-C(=NH)- depicted in formula I the tautomeric group R1-N=C(-NH2)- is present.<br>
Diastereomers, including E/Z isomers, can be separated into the individual isomers, for example, by chromatography. Racemates can be separated into the two enantiomers by customary methods, for example by chromatography on chiral phases or by resolution, for example by crystallization of diastereomeric salts obtained with optically active acids or bases, Stereochemically uniform compounds of the formula I can also be obtained by employing stereochemically uniform starting materials or by using stereoselective reactions.<br><br>
The choice of incorporating into a compound of the formula I a building block with R configuration or S configuration, or in the case of an amino acid unit present in a compound of the formula I of incorporating a building block designated as D-amino acid or L-amino acid, can depend, for example, on the desired characteristics of the compound of the formula I. For example, the incorporation of a D-amino acid building block can confer increased stability in vitro or in vivo. The incorporation of a D-amino acid building block also can achieve a desired increase or decrease in the pharmacological activity of the compound. In some cases it can be desirable to allow the compound to remain active for only a short period of time. In such cases, the incorporation of an L-amino acid building block into the compound can allow endogenous peptidases in an individual to digest the compound in vivo, thereby limiting the individual's exposure to the active compound. A similar effect may also be observed in the compounds of the invention by changing the configuration in another building block from S configuration to R configuration or vice versa. By taking into consideration the medical needs one skilled in the art car, determine the desirable characteristics, for example a favorable stereochemistry, cf the required compound of the invention.<br>

Further, preferred compounds of the formula I are compounds in which chiral centers independently of one another are present in uniform or substantially uniform configuration.<br>
The present invention also relates to processes of preparation by which the compounds of the formula I are obtainable. The compounds of the formula I can generally be prepared by linkage of two or more fragments (or building blocks) which can be derived retrosyntheticaHy from the formula I. In the preparation of the compounds of the formula I it can generally be advantageous or necessary in the course of the synthesis to introduce functionaJ groups which could lead to undesired reactions or side reactions in a synthesis step in the form of precursors which are later converted into the desired functional groups. As examples of precursor groups cyano groups may be mentioned which may later be converted into amidino groups, or nitro groups which may be converted into amino groups. Protecting groups (or blocking groups) that may be present on functional groups include allyl, tert-butyl, benzyl, allyloxycarbonyl (Alloc), tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc), benzyloxycarbonyl (Z) and 9-fiuorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) as protecting groups for hydroxy, carboxylic acid, amino and amidino groups.<br>
In particular, in the preparation of the compounds of the formula I building blocks can be connected by performing one or more condensation reactions and/or addition reactions such as amide couplings and (thio)urea formations, i. e. by forming an<br><br>
amide bond between a carboxylic acid group of one building block and an amino group of another building block, or by establishing a (thio)urea linkage between two amino groups of two building blocks. For example, compounds of the formula I can be prepared by linking the building blocks of the formulae II, III, and IV<br><br>
by means of forming in a manner known per se a (thio)urea bridge between the group G1 depicted in formula II and the group G2 depicted in formula III, and by forming in a manner known per se an amide bond between the carboxylic acid derivative group COZ depicted in formuia HI and the NH2 group depicted in formula IV.<br>
In the compounds of the formulae II, IB and IV the groups and numbers m, n, A, R2, R3, R4 and R5 are as defined above. Rc is the amidino group R1NH-C(=NH)- wherein R1 is defined as above, or a protected form thereof or a precursor group thereof, for example a cyano group which is later inverted into the group R1NHC(=NH)~ present in the final compounds of formula I. rn general, in addition to the denotations of the groups and substituents given above, in the compounds of the formulae II, III and IV, functional groups can also be present in the form, of precursor groups which are later converted into the groups present in the compounds of the formula I, or can be present in protected form.<br>
One of the groups G1 and G2 is a free amino group, i. e. an NH2 group in the case of G1 and an NHR6 group in the case'of G2, and the other is an amino group suitably functionalized for the formation of a (th5o)urea bridge, or is converted into such a functionalized group, for example an iso(thio)cyanato group or a (Ci-Ce)-<br><br>
alkoxycarbonylamino group or a trichloromethylcarbonylamino group or an azolyl-N-(thio)carbonylamino group such as an imidazoM-yl(thio)carbonylamino group, where the functionalized group G2 contains the group R6 or a protected form or a precursor group of the group R6. The group Z in the compounds of the formula 111 is hydroxy or a nucleophilically substitutable leaving group, i, e. the group COZ in the compounds of the formula III is a carboxylic acid group COOH or an activated derivative of a carboxylic acid such as, for example, an acid chloride, an ester like a (C1-C12-alkyl ester or an activated ester, or a mixed anhydride.<br>
The starting compounds of the formulae II, HI and IV and other compounds which are employed in the synthesis of the compounds of formula I for introducing certain structural units, are commercially available or can be readily prepared from commercially available compounds by or analogously to procedures described below or in the literature which is readily available to those skilled in the art.<br>
For the preparation of the compounds of formula I first the compounds a tne formulae II and 111 may be linked and the resulting intermediate product then be . condensed with a compound of the formula IV to give a compound of the formulaI. Just so, first the compounds of the formulae ill and IV may be condensadanc the resulting intermediate product then be linked to a compound of the formds H to give a compound of the formula 1. After any such reaction step in the course cf such syntheses protecting and deprotecting steps and conversions of preonssr groups into the desired final groups may be earned out and further modifications may be made.<br>
The (thio)urea bridge between the building blocks for formulae II and III can be established, for example, by first converting in a compound of the formula II an amino group (NH2 group) representing G1 into a functionalized amino group like an iso(thio)cyanato group by means of (thio)phosgene or a phosgene equivalent like triphosgene, or a (CrC6)-alkoxycarbonyJamino group by means of a (CrCsJ-alkyl chlorofomnate such as ethyl chloroformate or isobutyl chloroformate, or an imkJazol-1-y1(thio)carbonylamino group by means of N,N'-(thio)carbonyldiirnidazole, or a<br><br>
trichloromethylcarbonylamino group by means of trichloroacetyl chloride. The resulting intermediate is then reacted with a compound of the formula Hi in which G2 is a free NHR5 group which adds to the iso(thio)cyanato group or replaces the irnidazolyl group, alkoxy group or trichloromethyl group, respectively. Alternatively, first in a compound of the formula 111 an amino group (NHR6 group) representing G2 can be functionaiized to give an iso(thio)cyanato group, (CrC6)-alkoxycarbonylamino group, imidazol-1-yl(thio)carbony( group or trichloromethylcarbonylamino group, and the resulting intermediate is then reacted with a compound of the formula II in which G1 is a free NH2 group. The conversion of an amino group into an iso(thio)cyanato group, (CrCsj-alkoxycarbonylamino group, imidazol-1-y((thio)carbonyl group or trichloromethylcarbonylamino group as well as the subsequent reaction of the intermediate with an amine can be performed according to standard procedures which are well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Various general methods for the formation of an amide bond that can be employed in the synthesis of the compounds of formula I are just so well known to those skilled in the art, for example from peptide chemistry. An amide coupling step can favorably be carried out by employing a free carboxylic acid, i. e. a compound of the formula III or an intermediate coupBng product in which a group like COZ reacting in that step is a COOH group, activating that carboxylic acid group, preferably In situ, by means of a customary coupling rsagent such as a carbodiimide like dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) or diisopropyk^rbcKfiirnide (D1C), or an N.N'-carbonyldiazole like N,N'-carbonyldiimidazole, or a uranium salt like 0-((cyano(ethoxycarbonyl)methylene)-amino)-1,1,3,3-tetrarnethyiuronium tetrafluoroborate (TOTU) or 0-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyfuronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU), or a chloroformic acid ester like ethyl chloroformate or isobuty! chloroformate, or tosyl chloride, or propylphosphonic acid anhydride, or others, and then reacting the activated carboxylic acid derivative with an amino compound of the formula IV. An amide bond can also be formed by reacting an amino compound with a carboxylic acid halide, in particular a carboxylic acid chloride, which can be prepared in a separate step or in situ from a carboxylic acid and, for example, thionyl chloride, or an carboxylic acid ester or thioester, for example a methyl ester, ethyl ester, phenyl ester, nitrophenyl<br><br>
ester, pentafluorophenyi ester, methylthio ester, phenylthio ester or pyridin-2-ylthio ester, i. e. with a compound of the formula 111 or with an intermediate coupling product in which a group like Z is chlorine, methoxy, ethoxy, optionally substituted phenoxy, methylthio, phenylthio or pyridin-2-ylthio.<br>
The activation reactions and coupling reactions are usually performed in the presence of an inert solvent (or diluent), for example in the presence of an aprotic solvent like dimethylformamide (DMF), tetrahydrofuran (THF), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), hexamethyf phosphoric triamide (HMPT), 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME), dioxane, or others, or in a mixture of such solvents. Depending on the specific process, the reaction temperature may be varied over a wide range and may be, for example, from about -20°C to about the boiling temperature of the solvent or diluent. Also depending on the specific process, it may be necessary or advantageous to add in a suitable amount one or more auxiliary agents, for example a base like a tertiary amine, such as triethyiamine or dfisopropylethylamine, or an alkali metal alcoholate, such as sodium metncxide or potassium tert-butoxide, for adjusting the pH or neutralizing an acid that is formed or for liberating the free base of an amino compound that is employed in the form of an acid addition salt, or an N-hydroxyazole like 1 -hydroxybenzoiriazole. or a catalyst like 4-dimethyIaminopyridine. Details on methods for the preparation of activated carboxylic acid derivatives and the formation of amide bonds and sster txsnds as well as source literature are given in various standard references ake, for example, J. March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, 4th ed., John Wiley &amp; Sens, 1SS2: or Houben-Weyl, Methoden der organischen Chemie [Methods of Organic Chemistry], Georg Thieme Verlag.<br>
Protective groups that may still be present in the products obtained in the coupling reaction are then removed by standard procedures. For example, tert-butyl protecting groups can be cleaved off with trifluoroacetic acid. In particular a tert-butoxycarbonyl-substituted amidino group or amino group which is a protected form of an amidino group or amino group, can be deprotected, i. e. converted into the amidino group or amino group, by treatment-with trifluoroacetic acid. As already explained, functional groups can also be generated after the coupling reaction from suitable precursor<br><br>
groups. In addition, a conversion into a physiologically tolerable salt or a prodrug of a compound of the formula I can then be carried out by known processes.<br>
As examples of the introduction of specific functional groups procedures for the introduction of amidino groups, i. e. the group H2N-C(=NH)- also designated as arnino-imino-methyl- group or carbamimidoyl group, may be explained which groups may also represent the group R10, for example. Amidines can be prepared from cyano compounds by addition of an alcohol under acidic anhydrous conditions, for example in methanol or ethanol saturated with hydrogen chloride, and subsequent ammonolysis. A further method of preparing amidines is the addition of hydrogen sulfide to the cyano group, followed by methylation of the resulting thioamide and subsequent reaction with ammonia- Another method Is the addition of hydroxylamine to the cyano group which leads to a hydroxyamidino group. If desired the N-0 bond in the hydroxyarnidine can be cleaved, for example by catalytic hydrogenation, to give the amidine.<br>
\n general, a reaction mixture containing a final compound of the formula I or an intermediate is worked up and, if desired, the product is then purified by customary processes known to those skilled in the art. For example, a synthesized compound can be purified using well known methods such as crystallization, chromatography or T-verse phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) or ether methods cf separation bas£d, for example, on the size, charge or hydrophobic^ of the compound. Similarly, well known methods such as amino acid sequence analysis, NMn, JR and mass spectrometry (MS) can be used for characterizing a compound of the invention.<br>
The reactions described above and below that are carried out in the syntheses of the compounds of the formula I can generally tJe carried out according to the methods of conventional solution phase chemistry.<br>
The compounds of the present invention inhibit the activity of the blood coagulation enzyme factor Vila. In particular, they are specific inhibitors of factor Vila. As used<br><br>
herein, the term specific when used in reference to the inhibition of factor Vila activity means that a compound of the formula I can inhibit factor Vila activity without substantially inhibiting the activity of other specified proteases involved in the blood coagulation and/or the fibrinolysis pathway including, for example, factor Xa, plasmin and thrombin (using the same concentration of the inhibitor). The compounds of the invention inhibit factor Vila catalytic activity either directly, within the prothrombinase complex or as a soluble subunit, or indirectly, by inhibiting the assembly of factor Vila into the prothrombinase complex.<br>
Because of their factor Vila inhibitory activity the compounds of the formula I are useful pharmacologically active compounds which are suitable, for example, for influencing blood coagulation (or blood clotting) and fibrinolysis and for the treatment, including therapy and prophylaxis, of diseases such as, for example, cardiovascular disorders, thromboembolic diseases or restenoses. The compounds of the formula I and their physiologically tolerable salts and their prodrugs can be administered to animals, preferably to mammals, and in particular to humans as pharmaceuticals for therapy or prophylaxis. They can be administered on their own, or in mixtures with one another or in the form of pharmaceutical preparations which permit enteral or parenteral administration and which contain, as active constituent, an effective amount of at least one compound of the formula I and/or its physiologically tolerable salts and/or its prodrugs and a pharmaceutical^ acceptable carrier.<br>
The present invention therefore also relates to the compounds of the formula I and/or their physiologically tolerable salts and/or their prodrugs for use as pharmaceuticals (or medicaments), to the use of the compounds of the formula I and/or their physiologically tolerable salts and/or their prodrugs for the production of pharmaceuticals for inhibition of factor Vila or for influencing blood coagulation or fibrinolysis or for the treatment, including therapy and prophylaxis, of the diseases mentioned above or below, for example for the production of pharmaceuticals for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders, thromboembolic diseases or restenoses. The invention also relates to the use of the compounds of the formula I and/or their physiologically tolerable salts and/or their prodrugs for the inhibition of factor Vila or<br><br>
for influencing blood coagulation or fibrinolysis or for the treatment of the diseases mentioned above or below, for example for use in the treatment, including therapy and prophylaxis, of cardiovascular disorders, thromboembolic diseases or restenoses, and to methods of treatment aiming at such purposes including methods for said therapies and prophylaxes. The present invention furthermore relates to pharmaceutical preparations (or pharmaceutical compositions) which contain an effective amount of at least one compound of the formula I and/or its physiologically tolerable salts and/or its prodrugs and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, i. e. one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carrier substances (or vehicles) and/or additives (or excipients).<br>
The pharmaceuticals can be administered orally, for example in the form of pills, tablets, lacquered tablets, coated tablets, granules, hard and soft gelatin capsules, solutions, syrups, emulsions, suspensions or aerosol mixtures. Administration, however, can also be carried out rectally, for example in the form of suppositories, or parenterally, for example intravenously, intramuscularly cr subcutaneously, in the form of injection solutions or infusion solutions, microcapsules, implants or rods, or percutaneously or topically, for example in the form cf ointments, solutions or tinctures, or in other ways, for example in the form cf aerosols or nasal sprays.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations according to the invention are prepared in a manner known per se and familiar to one skilled in ire art, phamnaceutically acceptable inert inorganic and/or organic carrier surstances and/or additives being used in addition to the compound(s) of the formula I arc/or its (their) physiologically tolerable salts and/or its (their) prodrugs. For the production of pills, tablets, coated tablets and hard gelatin capsules it is possible to use, for example, lactose, com starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts, etc. Carrier substances for soft gelatin capsules and suppositories are', for example, fats, waxes, semisolid and liquid polyols, natural or hardened ,oils, etc. Suitable carrier substances for the production of solutions, for example injection solutions, or of emulsions or syrups are, for example, water, saline, alcohols, glycerol, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar, glucose, vegetable oils, etc. Suitable carrier substances for microcapsules, implants or rods<br><br>
are, for example, copolymers of glycolic acid and lactic acid. The pharmaceutical preparations normally contain about 0.5 to about 90 % by weight of the compounds of the formula I and/or their physiologically tolerable salts and/or their prodrugs. The amount of the active ingredient of the formula I and/or its physiologically tolerable salts and/or its prodrugs in the pharmaceutical preparations normally is from about 0.5 to about 1000 mg, preferably from about 1 to about 500 mg, per unit, but depending on the type of the pharmaceutical preparation it may also be higher.<br>
*<br>
In addition to the active ingredients of the formula I and/or their physiologically acceptable salts and/or prodrugs and to carrier substances, the pharmaceutical preparations can contain one or more additives such as, for example, fillers, disintegrants, binders, lubricants, wetting agents, stabilizers, emuls'rfiers, preservatives, sweeteners, colorants, flavorings, aromatizers, thickeners, diluents, buffer substances, solvents, solubilizers, agents for achieving a depot effect, salts for altering the osmotic pressure, coating agents or antioxidants. They can also contain two or more compounds of the formula I and/or their physiologically tolerable salts and/or their prodrugs. In case a pharmaceutical preparation contains two or more compounds of the formula I the selection of the individual compounds can aim at a specific overall pharmacological profile of the pharmaceutical preparation. For example, a highly potent compound with a shorter duration of action may be combined with a long-acting compound of lower potency. THE fiexifaEty permitted with respect to the choice of substituents in the compounds of Irs formula f allows a great deal of control over the biological and physico-chemical properties of the compounds and thus allows the selection of such desired compounds. Funhermore, in addition to at least one compound of the formula I and/or its physiologically tolerable salts and/or its prodrugs, the pharmaceutical preparations can also contain one or more other therapeutically or prophylactically active ingredients.<br>
As inhibitors of factor Vila the compounds of the formula I and their physiologically tolerable salts and their prodrugs are generally suitable for the therapy and prophylaxis of conditions in which the activity of factor Vila plays a role or has an undesired extent, or which can favorably be influenced by inhibiting factor Vila or<br><br>
decreasing its activity, or for the prevention, alleviation or cure of which an inhibition of factor Vila or a decrease in its activity is desired by the physician. As inhibition of factor Vila influences blood coagulation and fibrinolysis the compounds of the formula 1 and their physiologically tolerable salts and their prodrugs are generally suitable for reducing blood clotting, or for the therapy and prophylaxis of conditions in which the activity of the blood coagulation system plays a role or has an undesired extent, or which can favorably be influenced by reducing blood clotting, or for the prevention, alleviation or cure of which a decreased activity of the blood coagulation system is desired by the physician. A specific subject of the present invention thus are the reduction or inhibition of unwanted blood clotting, in particular in an individual, by administering an effective amount of a compound I or a physiologically tolerable salt or a prodrug thereof, as well as pharmaceutical preparations therefor.<br>
Conditions in which a compound of the formula I and/or a physiologically tolerable salt thereof and/or a prodrug thereof can be favorably used include, for example, cardiovascular disorders, thromboembolic diseases or complications associated, for example, with infection or surgery. The compounds of the present invention can also be used to reduce an inflammatory response. Examples of specific disorders for the treatment, including therapy and prophylaxis, of which the compounds of the formula 1 can be used are coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, vascular restenosis, for example restenosis following angioplasty like PTCA, adult respiratory disstress syndrome, multi-organ failure, stroke and disseminated intravascular clotting disorder. Examples of related complications associated with surgery are thromboses like deep vein and proximal vein thrombosis which can occur following surgery. In view of their pharmacological activity the compounds of the invention can replace other anticoagulant agents such as heparin. The use of a compound of the invention can result, for example, in a cost saving as compared to other anticoagulants.<br>
When using the compounds of the formula I the dose can vary wfthin wide limits and, as is customary and is known to the physician, is to be suited to the individual conditions in each individual case. It depends, for example, on the specific compound<br><br>
employed, on the nature and severity of the disease to be treated, on the mode and the schedule of administration, or on whether an acute or chronic condition is treated or whether prophylaxis is carried out. An appropriate dosage can be established using clinical approaches well known in the medical art. In general, the daily dose for achieving the desired results in an adult weighing about 75 kg is from about 0.01 to about 100 mg/kg, preferably from about 0.1 to about 50 mg/kg, in particular from about 0.1 to about 10 mg/kg, (in each case in mg per kg of body weight). The daily dose can be divided, in particular in the case of the administration of relatively large amounts, into severaJ, for example 2,3 or A, part administrations. As usual, depending on individual behavior it may be necessary to deviate upwards or downwards from the daily dose indicated.<br>
A compound cf the formula I can also advantageously be used as an anticoagulant outside an individual. For example, an effective amount of a compound of the invention can be contacted with a freshly drawn blood sample to prevent coagulation of the blocd sample. Further, a compound of the formula I or its salts can be used for diagnostic purposes, for example in in vitro diagnoses, and as an auxiliary or tool in biochemical investigations. For example, a compound of the formula I can be used in an assay to identify the presence of factor Vila or to isolate factor Vila in a substantially purified form. A compound of the invention can be labeled, for example, with a radkisotope and the labeled compound bound to factor Vila is then detected using a routine method useful for detecting the particular label. Thus, a compound of the formula I or a salt thereof can be used advantageously as a probe to detect the location or amount of factor Vila activity in vivo, in vitro or ex vivo.<br>
Furthermore, the compounds of the formula I can be used as synthesis intermediates for the preparation of other compounds, in particular of other pharmaceutical active ingredients, which are obtainable from the compounds of the formula I, for example by introduction of substituents or modification of functional groups.<br>

Pharmacological testing<br>
The ability of the compounds of the formula i to inhfcft factor Vila or other enzymes fike factor Xa, thrombin, plasmin, or trypsin can be assessed by determining the concentration of the compound of the formula I that inhibits enzyme activity by 50 %, i. e. the IC50 value, which is related to the inhibition constant Ki. Purified enzymes are used in chromogenic assays. The concentration of inhibitor that causes a 50 % decrease in the rate of substrate hydrolysis is determined by linear regression after plotting the relative rates of hydrolysis (compared to the uninhibited control) versus the log of the concentration of the compound of formula I. For calculating the<br><br>
inhibition constant Ki, the IC50 value is corrected for competition with substrate using<br>
the formula	Ki = IC50 / {1 + (substrate concentration / Km)}<br>
wherein Km is the Michaelis-Menten constant (Chen and Prusoff, Biochem. Pharmacol. 22 (1973), 3099-3108; I. H. Segal, Enzyme Kinetics, 1975, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 100-125; which are incorporated herein by reference).<br>
a) Factor Vila (FVIIa) Assay<br>
The inhibitory activity (expressed as inhibition constant Ki(FVIia)) of the compounds of formula I towards factor Vila/tissue factor activity was determined using a chromogenic assay essentially as described previously (J. A. Ostrem et al., Biochemistry 37 (1998) 1053-1059 which is incorporated herein by reference). . Kinetic assays were conducted at 25°C in half-area microtiter pferes (Costar Corp., Cambridge, Massachusetts) using a kinetic plate reader (Molecular Devices Spectramax 250). A typical assay consisted of 25 p\ human factor Vila and TF (5 nM and 10 nM, respective final concentration) combined with 40 p\ G» inhifaitor dilutions in 10 % DMSO/TBS-PEG buffer (50 mM Tris, 15 mM NaCI, 5 mM teCh, 0,05 % PEG 8000, pH 8.15). Following a 15 minute preincubation period, the assay was initiated by the addition of 35 p\ of the chromogenic substrate S-22S8 (D-IIe-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide, Pharmacia Hepar Inc., 500 pU final concentration).<br>

Rat Arteriovenous Shunt Model of Thrombosis<br>
The antithrombotic efficacy of the compounds of the invention can be assessed using rat extracorporeal arteriovenous (AV) shunt. The AV shunt circuit consists of a 20 cm length of polyethylene (PE) 60 tubing inserted into the right carotid artery, a 6 cm length of PE 160 tubing containing a 6.5 cm length of mercerized cotton thread (5 cm exposed to blood flow), and a second length of PE 60 tubing (20 cm) completing the<br><br>
circuit into the left jugular vein. The entire circuit is filled with normal saline prior to insertion.<br>
The test compound is administered by continuous infusion into the tail vein using a syringe pump and butterfly catheter. The compound is administered for 30 min, then the shunt is opened and blood allowed to flow for a period of 15 min (total of 45 min infusion). At the end of the 15 min period, the shunt is clamped and the thread is carefully removed and weighed on an analytical balance. Percent inhibition of thrombus formation is calculated using the thrombus weight obtained from control rats which are infused with saline.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
