FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a photopolymer printing plate precursor comprising in this order a photosensitive coating and a protective coating on a support, wherein said photosensitive coating comprises a composition that is photopolymerizable upon absorption of light, said composition comprising a binder, a polymerizable compound, a radical stabilizer, a sensitizer and a photoinitiator.<br>
The invention also relates to a method of making a lithographic printing plate therewith.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In lithographic printing, a so-called printing master such as a printing plate is mounted on a cylinder of the printing press. The master carries a lithographic image on its surface and a printed copy is obtained by* applying ink to said image and then transferring* the ink from the master onto a receiver material, which is typically paper. In conventional, so-called *wet" lithographic printing, ink as well as an aqueous fountain solution (also called dampening liquid) are supplied to the lithographic image which consists of oleophilic (or hydrophobic, i.e. ink-accepting, water-repelling) areas as well as hydrophilic (or oleophobic, i.e. water-accepting, ink-repelling) areas. In so-called "driographic" printing, the lithographic image consists of ink-accepting and ink-abhesive (ink-repelling) areas and during driographic printing, only ink is supplied to the master.<br>
Printing masters are generally obtained by the so-called computer-to-film (CtF) method, wherein various pre-press steps such as typeface selection, scanning, color separation, screening, trapping, layout and imposition are accomplished digitally and each color selection is transferred to graphic arts film using an image-<br><br>
setter. After processing, the film can be used as a mask for the exposure of an imaging material called plate precursor and after plate processing, a printing plate is obtained which can be used as a master. Since about 1995, the so-called xcomputer-to-plate' (CtP) method has gained a lot of interest. This method, also called *direct-to-platef, bypasses the creation of film because the digital document is transferred directly to a printing plate precursor by means of a so-called plate-setter. A printing plate precursor for CtP is often called a digital plate.<br>
Digital plates can roughly be divided in three categories : (i) silver plates, which work according to the silver salt diffusion transfer mechanism; (ii) photopolymer plates which contain a photopolymerizable composition that hardens upon exposure to light and (iii) thermal plates of which the imaging mechanism is triggered by heat or by light-to-heat conversion. Thermal plates are mainly sensitized for infrared lasers emitting at 830 nm or 1064 nm. Typical photopolymer plates are sensitized for visible light, mainly for exposure by an Ar laser (488 nm) or a FD-YAG laser (532 nm) â€¢ The wide-scale availability of low cost blue or violet laser diodes, originally developed for data storage by means of DVD, has enabled the production of plate-setters operating at shorter wavelength. More specifically, semiconductor lasers emitting from 350 to 450 nm have been realized using an InGaN material.<br>
Radicals are involved in the hardening reaction of the photopolymerizable composition of photopolymer plates and said hardening reaction is known to be adversely affected by oxygen. To reduce this problem it is known to provide the photosensitive coating with a protective coating, also called oxygen barrier layer, protective overcoat or overcoat layer.<br>
According toDE2629 883Al the oxygen barrier layer of a presensitized lithographic printing plate should contain a poly (vinyl alcohol), wherein at least 2 % of the hydroxy groups of said poly(vinyl alcohol) are esterified by a dicarboxylic acid, to provide an oxygen barrier layer, that can be dissolved in the same<br><br>
solvent as used for the developer and that does not adversely effect the image forming process. The printing plate precursors known from DE 26 29 883 only have a low sensitivity, what is disclosed on p. 17, reading that low exposure (corresponding to high sensitivity) means 3 s when using 4 high pressure mercury vapour lamps of 150 Watts each.<br>
EP 1 148 387 Al discloses photographic printing plates comprising a photosensitive layer and a protective layer, that have a maximum peak of spectral sensitivity with a wavelength range of from 390 to 430 nm, and wherein the minimum exposure for the photosensitive lithographic printing plate for image formation at a wavelength of 410 nm is at most 100 pJ/cm2. Said protective layer is provided on the photosensitive layer as oxygen-shielding layer and preferred examples of protective layers according to EP 1 148 387 Al contain water-soluble polymers such as poly(vinyl alcohol), poly(vinyl pyrrolidone), poly(ethylene oxide) and cellulose; a mixture of poly(vinyl alcohol) and poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) being particularly preferred.<br>
According to EP 1 280 006 A2 a protective layer is provided on the layer of photopolymerizable composition, wherein said protective layer inhibits the penetration of a low molecular compound such as oxygen and can contain water-soluble polymers that have relatively high crystallinity. Preferably poly(vinyl alcohol) with a saponification degree of 71 % to 100 % is used as a basic component, that may be partially replaced by an ester, ether or acetal, and the photopolymerizable composition comprises a photopolymerization initiation system consisting of a specific sensitizing dye and a titanocene compound.<br>
To improve the behaviour of photopolymerization compositions prior to exposure, that is to reduce unwanted polymerization during preparation and storage of photopolymerizable compositions it is known from e.g. EP 0 924 570 Al, EP 1 035 435 A2, EP 1 070 990 Al and EP 1 081 552 Al to add thermopolymerization inhibitors to the photosensitive compositions.<br><br>
EP 0 738 929 discloses a photopolymerizable sensitive material which comprises a support, a photopolymerizable sensitive layer comprising an addition polymerizable compound, a photopolymerizable initiator and a binder, formed on a support, and a protective layer formed thereon, that comprises a mixture of (a) polyvinylalcohol and/or a polyvinylalcohol derivative (FVA) and (b) a polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), whereby the proportion of component (a) in the total amount of components (a) and (b) is from 25 to 75 weigth %.<br>
EP 1 288 722 discloses a printing plate precursor, wherein the photopolymerizable layer comprises a titanocene type initiator.<br>
After imaging (exposing) the photopolymer printing plate precursor, the plate is heated for a short time to high temperatures before the overcoat is washed off and the photolayer is developed. This heating step is hereinafter called pre-heat step. During the pre-heat step typical temperatures, when measured at the back of the plate, from about 90Â°C to 150Â°C are used for a short time, typically between 10 seconds and 1 minute. As the conditions of the pre-heat step vary with different types of processors and even for the same processor, a printing plate should exhibit consistent results irrespective to the pre-heat conditions, in particular to the temperature. The range of pre-heat conditions, wherein a printing plate exhibits consistent results is called the pre-heat latitude of said plate.<br>
In particular when using high pre-heat temperatures, so called ^asteroid' defects often occur in non-image areas of known printing plates. Such asteroids are of irregular shape having a mean diameter of about 1 to 50 pm. As such asteroids adsorb ink and therefore are printing, although being in an unexposed area, they deteriorate the quality of the resulting print and are prohibitive for high quality results. The maximum pre-heat temperature that can be used for a given printing plate precursor without the occurence of asteroid defects is called Tmax(^asteroid'-free).<br>
The photopolymer printing plate precursors according to the prior art are unsatisfactory, as such plates exhibit an<br><br>
unsatisfactory T,,^ (^asteroid' -free), in particular when providing<br>
sufficient speed (sensitivity) to enable a short exposure time with the commercially available low cost and low power blue or violet laser diodes*<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a highspeed photopolymer printing plate precursor, that has a high 1  Tu^Pasteroid'-free) and therefore is suitable for all known types<br>
of processors and processes used to make a printing plate. This object is realized as defined in claim 1. The printing plate precursor of the present invention is a flexographic or lithographic printing plate precursor, the latter being highly preferred. Also a method of making a lithographic printing plate, wherein said printing plate precursor is exposed with a laser having an emission wavelength in the range from 300 to 450 nm, is an aspect of the present invention. Preferred photopolymer printing plate precursors according to the present invention can be exposed with an energy<br>
2<br>
density, measured on the surface of the plate of 100 pJ/cm or less.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the printing plate precursor, of the method of making a lithographic printing plate and of the use according to the present invention are defined in the dependent claims.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a photopolymer printing plate precursor comprising in this order a photosensitive coating and a protective coating on a support, wherein said photosensitive coating comprises a composition that is photopolymerizable upon absorption of light, said composition comprising a binder, a polymerizable compound, a radical stabilizer, a sensitizer and a photoinitiator,<br><br>
characterized in that the photoinitiator is a hexaaryl-bisimidazole compound and the protective layer has a dry coating weight from 0.5<br>
g/ro2 to less than 2.0 g/m2, preferrably from 0.50 g/m2 to 1.90 g/m2f and contains at least one type of poly(vinyl alcohol), having a saponification degree less than 93 mol%, and a poly (vinyl pyrrolidone) in an amount from 0 to 10 parts by weight of the poly(vinyl alcohol).<br>
By adjusting the dry coating weight of the protective layer of a photopolymer printing plate precursor to an amount smaller than<br>
2.0 g/m2, a substantially higher Troaxrasteroid'-free) can be<br>
achieved, if the photopolymerizable composition covered by said protective layer comprises a radical stabilizer.<br>
According to the present invention, said photoinitiator is a hexaaryl-bisimidazole compound. Using said photoinitiator results in a higher Tmax^ ^asteroid'-free) and in a higher sensitivity compared<br>
to known printing plate precursors.<br>
According to the present invention, the saponification degree of the polyvinylalcohol is less than 93 mol-% and a polyvinylpyrrolidone is used in an amount from 0 to 10 parts by weight of the polyvinylalcohol. In a preferred embodiment, a mixture of at least two types of polyvinylalcohol are used having an overall mean saponification degree of all the polyvinylalcohols which are used in the protective coating of less than 93 mol-% and a polyvinylpyrrolidone is used in an amount from 0 to 10 parts by weight of the polyvinylalcohols. Thereby is achieved a printing plate precursor having a higher T^(^asteroid'-free), the dot gain<br>
of which depends less on the pre-heat temperature.<br>
The radical stabilizer used in the present invention can be selected from known radical stabilizers. Compounds useful as radical stabilizers of the present invention are also known as antioxidants or radical scavengers that are used as additives for e.g. polymers. Preferably the radical stabilizer used in the present invention is a compound selected from the group consisting of phenoles, organic<br><br>
phosphites, organic phosphonites, amines, hydroxylamines, lactones, hydrochinones, divalent sulfur compounds like thioethers and thioesters, metal complexants, wherein phenoles comprise mono-, di-and trihydroxyphenyl compounds, and in particular the radical stabilizer used in the present invention is a compound selected from the group consisting of hindered phenoles, O-alkylated hydrochinones, organic phosphites, organic phosphonites, aromatic amines, hindered amines, dialkyl hydroxylamines, benzofuranones and dialkyl thiodipropionates. The members of said groups are also called classes in the following.<br>
Hindered phenoles that are particularly preferred for the present invention are substituted by at least one tertiary butyl group neighbouring to the phenolic hydroxy group. Further advantages can be achieved with phenolic compounds that contain long chain alkyl or alkylene groups, in particular such groups having from 6 to 25 Oatoms, from 9 to 22 C-atoms being further preferred. The phenolic compounds can comprise one, two, three or more phenol rings (mono-, di-, tri- or poly-phenolic compounds), one to six phenol rings beeing preferred. Tocopherols (see e.g. stabilizer (ST-20) in the following) are also useful radical stabilizers according to the present invention.<br>
The organic phospites and phosphonites of the present invention preferably are esters of hindered phenols as defined above and/or esters, of long chain alkoxy groups, wherein long chain has the same meaning as defined above.<br>
Aromatic amines used as stabilizers according to the present invention preferably are N,N'-disubstituted p-phenylenediamines, substituted diphenylamines or substituted dihydrochinolines, wherein optionally substituted phenyl groups and/or alkyl groups are preferred as substituents.<br>
Hindered amines, known as light stabilizers, are also useful radical stabilizers of the present invention. Preferred hindered amines are derivatives of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine (see e.g. (ST-28) in the following).<br><br>
A radical stabilizer according to the present invention can belong to only one of the classes listed above, but can also belong to two, three or a plurality of thoses classes. For example the stabilizer of formula (ST-13) (see below) belongs to the classes hindered phenoles and thioethers.<br>
Some radical stabilizers, when incorporated in the photopolymerizable composition of the present invention, improve the Tjnaxt ^asteroid'-free) even if the protective layer has a dry coating<br>
weight of 2.0 g/m2 or more, in particular up to 5.0 g/m2. Such stabilizers are called hereinafter particular efficient stabilizers. Nevertheless even when using said particular efficient stabilizers, the Tmax(*asteroid'-free) is substantially improved, if the<br>
protective layer has a dry coating weight of 0.5 to less then 2.0<br>
g/m2.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, the radical stabilizer is selected from the group of particular efficient stabilizers, this group consisting of phenolic compounds with more than two phenolic groups, organic phosphites, organic phosphonites and hindered amines.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the present invention the group of particular efficient stabilizers consists of hindered tri-and tetra-phenoles, hindered phenol esters of organic phosphites and hindered phenol esters of organic phosphonites.<br>
The photosensitive coating according to the present invention can comprise one, two, three or more different radical stabilizers. In the case where it contains more than one radical stabilizer, said compounds can belong to the same or different classes.<br>
Preferred examples of radical stabilizers according to the present invention are given in the following.<br>
I) Hindered phenoles<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Further examples of radical stabilizers according to the present invention are butylated hydroxyanisole, 3-tert-butyl-4-methoxyphenol, n-propyl gallate (3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoic acid propyl ester), pyrogallol (1,2,3-trihydroxybenzene), t-butyl catechol (t-butyl brenzcatechine), benzochinone, citric acid, N-nitrosophenylhydroxylamine and salts thereof.<br>
The radical stabilizers according to the present invention are preferably incorporated in the photopolymerizable composition in an amount of 0,01 to 5 wt.%, in particular from 0.015 to 3 wt.%, with respect to the total weight of the non-volatile compounds of the photopolymerizable composition.<br>
A sensitizing dye (sensitizer) preferably used in the present invention, when incorporated in the photopolymerizable composition, has an absorption wavelength ranging from 300 to 450 nm, preferably from 350 to 430 nm and particularly preferred from 360 to 420 nm, and makes the photopolymer printing plate sensitive to light within said wavelength ranges.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a sensitizer having a solubility in methyl ethyl ketone of at least 15 g/kg, preferably from 15 to 250 g/kg, measured at 20*C is used. Using such highly soluble sensitizers results in a higher TjaaxPasteroid'-free) and in a material having less pinhole defects.<br>
Defects called pinholes are areas having lateral dimensions of about 50 to 500 pm on the processed printing plate, that don't take up ink and therefore result in exposed areas that don't print. This unfavourable effect is particularly noticeable, if the printing plate precursor is stored before exposure and processing thereof. The known sensitizing dyes can be used in the composition of the present invention. Suitable classes include dialkylaminobenzene compounds like (la) and (lb)<br><br>
wherein each of R1 to R4, which are independent of one another, is an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms (C&gt;Â« alkyl group), and each of R5 to R8 is a hydrogen atom or a<br>
Ci-6 alkyl group, provided that R1 and R2, R3 and R4, R1 and R5, R2 and R6, R3 and R7, or R4 and R8, may be bonded to each other to form a ring;<br><br><br>

In order to achieve a high sensitivity, it is advantageous to add a radical chain transfer agent as described in EP 107 792 to the<br><br>
photopolymerizable composition of the present invention.

Their amount generally ranges from about 1 to 20 % by weight, preferably from 2 to 15 % by weight and particularly preferred from about 2 to 10 % by weight related to the total weight of the non volatile components of the composition. Particularly suitable predispersed phthalocyanine pigments are disclosed in DE 199 15 717 and DE 199 33 139. Preference is given to metal-free phthalocyanine pigments.<br>
In order to adjust the photopolymerizable composition according to the present invention to specific needs, thermal inhibitors or stabilizers for preventing thermal polymerization may be added. Furthermore additional hydrogen donors, dyes, colored or colorless pigments, color formers, indicators and plasticisers may be present. These additives are convieniently selected so that they absorb as little as possible in the actinic range of the imagewise applied radiation.<br>
The photopolymerizable composition according to the present invention is applied to the support by processes which are known per se to the person skilled in the art. In general, the components of the photopolymerizable composition are dissolved or dispersed in an organic solvent or solvent mixture, the solution or dispersion is applied to the intended support by pouring on, spraying on, emersion, roll application or in a similar and the solvents are removed during the subsequent drying.<br><br>
The known supports can be used for the photopolymer printing plate of the present invention, like e. g. foils, tapes or plates made of metal or plastics and in the case of screen-printing also of Perlon gauze. Preferred metals are aluminium, aluminium alloys, steel and zinc, aluminium and aluminium alloys being particularly preferred. Preferred plastics are polyester and cellulose acetates, polyethyleneterephthalate (PET) being particularly preferred.<br>
In most cases it is preferred, to treat the surface of the support mechanically and/or chemically and/or electrochemically to optimally adjust the adherence between the support and the photosensitive coating and/or to reduce the reflection of the imagewise exposed radiation on the surface of the support (antihalation) .<br>
The most preferred support to be used for the present invention is made of aluminium or an aluminium alloy, its surface is electrochemically roughened, thereafter anodized and optionally treated with a hydrophilizing agent like e. g. poly(vinylphosphonic acid).<br>
The protective overcoat according to the present invention comprises at least one type of poly (vinyl alcohol), wherein the mean degree of saponification is less than 93 mol-%, preferably a mixture of at least two types of poly (vinyl alcohol) wherein the overall mean degree of saponification of all the polyvinylalcohols is less than 93 mol-%.<br>
The degree of saponification is related to the production of poly(vinyl alcohols). As the monomer of poly(vinyl alcohol), vinyl alcohol, is nonexistent, only indirect methods are available for the production of poly(vinyl alcohol). The most important manufacturing process for poly(vinyl alcohol) is the polymerization of vinyl esters or ethers, with subsequent saponification or transesterification. The preferred starting material for the poly (vinyl alcohol) of the present invention is a vinyl alcohol esterified by a mono carboxylic acid and in particular vinyl acetate, but derivatives of vinyl acetate, vinyl esters of di<br><br>
carboxylic acids, vinyl ethers and the like can also be used. The degree of saponification as defined for the present invention is the molar degree of hydrolysis irrespective of the process used for the hydrolysis. Pure poly (vinyl alcohol) has e, g. a degree of saponification of 100 mol-%, but commercial products often have a degree of saponification of 98 mol-%. The poly(vinyl alcohols) as used for the present invention contain mainly 1,3-diol units, but may also contain small amounts of 1,2-diol units. In the partially saponified poly (vinyl alcohols) the ester or the ether group can be distributed statistically or blockwise. Preferred partially saponified poly (vinyl alcohols) of the present invention have a viscosity of a 4 % aqueous solution at 20Â°C of 4 to 60 mPaÂ»s, preferably of 4 to 20 mPaÂ»s and in particular of 4 to 10 mPa*s.<br>
Poly (vinyl alcohols) preferred for the present invention are commercially available e. g. under the tradename Mowiol. Those products are characterised by two appended numbers, meaning the viscosity and the degree of saponification. For example, Mowiol 8 -88 or Mowiol 8/88 mean a poly (vinyl alcohol) having as 4 % aqueous solution at 20Â°C a viscosity of ca $  mPaÂ»s and a degree of saponification of jJ8 mol-%. Although the use of only one type of poly (vinyl alcohol) is sufficient to achieve an advantage, it is preferred to use a mixture of two or more compounds, because this allows a more accurate adjustment and a better optimization of further properties of the printing plate precursor. Preferably poly(vinyl alcohols) differing in viscosity as defined above and/or in saponification degree are combined. Particularly preferred are mixture of poly (vinyl alcohols) that differ in viscosity of their 4 % aqueous solutions at 20eC for at least 2 mPaÂ«s or that differ in saponification degree for at least 5 mol-%. Most preferred are mixtures comprising at least 3 types of poly(vinyl alcohols), wherein at least two compounds differ in viscosity as defined above for at least 2 mPaÂ»s and at least two compounds differ in saponification degree for at least 5 mol-%.<br><br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a mixture of at least two types of polyvinylalcohol are used wherein the overall mean saponification degree of all polyvinyl alcohols used in the protective layer has to be less than 93 mol-%. Thereby is achieved a higher Tmax( ^asteroid'-free) and also an improved preheat latitude with respect to the dot gain, i.e. the dot gain is less influenced by the pre-heat temperature compared to higher overall mean saponification degrees. In a particular preferred embodiment of the present invention said overall mean saponification degree ranges from 71 mol-% to less than 93 mol-% and in particular from 80 mol-% to 92,9 mol-%.<br>
As long as said mean overall saponification limit of 93 mol-% is not reached, one of the poly (vinyl alcohols) used in a mixture can have a mean saponification degree of more than 93 mol-% and even up to 100 mol-%.<br>
The overall mean saponification degree of the poly (vinyl alcohols) used in the protective overcoat of a printing plate precursor can be determined experimentally via 13C-NMR, To measure the 13C-NMR spectra, approximately 200 mg of the protective overcoat are dissolved in 1.0 ml DMSO and from this solution a 75 MHz 13ONMR spectrum is taken, whose resonances can easily be interpreted and allow to calculate the degree of saponification. Such values are listed in the Examples, in Table 3, as  experimental values. A good correlation is obtained between said experimental values and the values known from the product specification of the poly(vinyl alcohols). The latter values are hereinafter called theoretical values of the mean saponification degree and can easily be calculated, when mixture of poly (vinyl alcohols) are used.<br>
Preferably poly(vinyl alcohol)s are used for the present invention in 50 to 99.9 weight percent (wt.%) relative to the total weight of the non-volatile compounds of the protective overcoat.<br>
According to the present invention, the protective layer further contains a poly (vinyl pyrrolidone) in an amount from 0 to 10 parts by weight of the poly (vinyl alcohol) used, from 0 to 3 parts<br><br>
by weight being particularly preferred. Most preferred no poly (vinyl pyrrolidone)compounds are used.<br>
Apart from poly (vinyl alcohol) s and poly (vinyl pyrrolidone), other water soluble polymers can be further added to the layer such as poly(ethylene oxide), gelatin, gum arabic, oxygen binding polymers with aliphatic amine groups known from EP 352 630 Bl, methyl vinylether/maleic anhydride copolymers, poly(carboxylic acids), copolymers of ethylene oxide and poly(vinyl alcohol), carbon hydrates, hydroxy ethyl cellulose, acidic cellulose, cellulose, poly(arylic acid)and mixtures of these polymers*<br>
In addition to the poly (vinyl alcohol) and polyvinylpyrrolidone of the present invention and the optional watersoluble polymers disclosed above, the known ingredients of protective layers can be used.<br>
Examples of known ingredients suitable for the protective layer of the present invention are surface wetting agents, coloring agents, complexants, polyethylenimines and biocides.<br>
The protective layer has to be transparent for actinic light. Preferably it is homogeneous, substantially impermeable to oxygen, waterpermeable, and can be washed off preferably with the conventional developer solutions used to form a printing relief after imagewise exposure of the photosensitive layer. Said photosensitive layer is removed imagewise, whereas the protective layer is removable over the entire area of the element created. The wash-off of the protective layer can be done in a separate stepr but can be done during the development step as well.<br>
The dry coating weight of the protective overcoat can be measured by the following procedure. A plate is exposed for 4 hours to daylight. Next the plate is pre-heated between 104Â°C and 127Â°C (temperature measured via a thermostrip (THERMAX commerically available from TMC) at the back of the plate) . The plate is cut to a size of 100 mm X 100 mm and weighted on an analytical balance with 0.01 mg accuracy (^Weight A). Next the protective overcoat is washed off. with water (25Â°C) for 2 minutes. Than the plate is rinsed with<br><br>
demineralised water and dried in an oven at 100*C. After drying the plate is allowed to cool down to room temperature, and the weight is determined using the same analytical balance as described earlier (=Weight B) . The dry coating weight in g/m2 of the protective overcoat is calculated using the formula below :<br>
Dry coating weight (g/m2)= 100 X (Weight A - Weight B)<br>
The protective layer can be coated on the photosensitive layer with known techniques and the coating solution preferably contains water or a mixture of water and an organic solvent. To allow a better wetting, the coating solution preferably contains, related to the solid content, up to 10 wt.%, and particular preferred up to 5 wt.% of a surface active agent. Suitable representatives of surface active agents comprise anionic, cationic and nonionic surface active agents like sodium alkylsulfates and -sulfonates having 12 to 18 carbon atoms, an example of which is sodium dodecylsulfate, N-cetyl-and C-cetyl betaine, alkylaminocarboxylate and -dicarboxylate, and polyethylene glycols with a mean molar weight up to 400.<br>
In addition, further functions can be added to the protective layer. For example, it can be possible to improve the safelight suitability without decreasing the sensitivity of the layer by adding a coloring agent, e. g. a water-soluble dye, that has excellent transmission to the light having a wavelength of 300 to 450 nm and that absorbs the light having a wavelength of 500 nm or more. This principle can easily be varied for different wavelengths to adjust the effective spectral sensitivity distribution of the printing plate precursor as needed.<br>
The present invention also relates to a method of making a &gt;     lithographic printing plate comprising the steps of providing a photopolymer printing plate precursor as defined in any of the preceding claims, exposing said printing plate precursor with a laser having an emission wavelength in the range from 300 to 450 nm, heating the plate to a temperature, when measured at the back of the<br><br>
plate, from about 90Â°C to 150*0, washing off the protective coating and processing the printing plate precursor in an aqueous alkaline developer<br>
In preferred embodiment of the process of the present invention the exposure is done with a laser having an emission wavelength in the range from 380 to 430 nm, in particular in the range from 390 to 420 nm, and the exposure is carried out at an energy density,<br>
measured on the surface of the plate, of 100 pJ/cm or less.<br>
The processing of the printing plate precursor of the present invention is done in the usual manner. After image-wise exposure a pre-heat step is performed to improve the crosslinking of the photosensitive layer. Usually the pre-heat step is then followed by the development step, wherein the complete overcoat layer and the unexposed part of the photosensitive layer are removed. The removal (wash-off) of the overcoat layer and the development of the photosensitive layer can be done in two separate steps in this order, but can also be done in one step simultaneously. Preferably the overcoat layer is washed-off with water before the development step. The wash-off can be done with cold water, but it is preferred to use hot water to accelerate the process. What remains on the support after the development step are the exposed and thereby photopolymerized parts of the photosensitive layer. The developer solution used for the development of the exposed printing plate precursors of the present invention preferably is an aqueous alkaline solution having a pH of at least 11, a pH from 11.5 to 13.5 being particularly preferred. The developer solution can contain a small percentage, preferably less than 5 wt.%, of an organic, water-miscible solvent. To adjust the pH of the solution, an alkali hydroxide is preferably used.<br>
Examples of preferred, additional ingredients of the developer solution comprise alone or in combination alkali phosphates, alkali carbonates, alkali bicarbonates, an organic amine compound, alkali silicates,'buffering agents, complexants, defoamers, surface active<br><br>
agents and dyes, but the suitable ingredients are not limited to the preferred examples and further ingredients can be used.<br>
The method of development employed is not particularly limited, and may be conducted by soaking and shaking the plate in a developer, physically removing non-image portions while being dissolved in a developer by means of e. g. a brush, or spraying a developer onto the plate so as to remove non-image portions. The time for development is selected depending upon the above method used so that the non-image portions can adequately by removed, and is optionally selected within a range of 5 seconds to 10 minutes.<br>
After the development, the plate my be subjected to a hydrophilic treatment by means of, e. g., gum arabic optionally applied to the printing plate as the case requires (gumming step) .<br><br>

Comparative Example 1<br>
A) Preparation and coating of the photosensitive layer<br>
A composition was prepared (pw - parts per weight; wt.% = weight percentage) by mixing the ingredients as specified in table 1. This composition was coated on an electrochemically roughened and anodically oxidized aluminum sheet, the surface of which has been rendered hydrophilic by treatment with an aqueous solution of poly(vinylphosphonic acid) (oxide weight 3 g/m2) and was dried at 105 Â°C. The resulting thickness of the layer was 1.5 g/m2.<br><br>
B) Preparation and coating of the protective overcoat layer<br>
On top of the photosensitive layer a solution in water (containing 4.0 wt.%) of the composition as defined in table 2 was 20     coated and then was dried at 120 Â°C for 2 minutes.<br><br><br>
The protective overcoat-had a dry coating weight of 1.90 g/m2.<br>
Evaluation of the pro-heat latitude<br>
Three plates were imaged with a 40% screen (110 lpi) at the appropriate exposure i.e. sensitivity of the plate .(minimum energy density to expose 2 solid steps (0.3 optical density) of an UGRA<br>
1982 step wedge). For this example the sensitivity is 26 pJ/cm2. The imaging was carried out with an experimental violet platesetter device (flat bed system) equipped with a violet laser diode emitting between 392 to 417 nm. The following imaging conditions were used:<br>
Scanning speed: 1000 m/s<br>
Variable image plane power: 0 to 10.5 mW<br>
Spot diameter: 20 pm<br>
Addressability: 1270 dpi<br>
After the imaging step the plate was processed in an Agfa VSP85 processor at a speed of 1.2 m/min. During the processing the plate is first heated (pre-heat step), next the protective overcoat is washed off and the photolayer is processed in a water based alkaline developer (Agfa EN 231C) at 28 *C . After a water rinsing and gumming step the printing plate is ready to use.<br><br>
The three plates were processed at different pre-heat temperatures <tpre_heat : and></tpre_heat>
143Â°C (i.e. temperature measured at the back of the plate with a thermostrip) - The temperature at the back of the plate was varied by varying the temperature of the ceramic heater of the processor.<br>
Next the image was visually inspected for ^asteroids'; these are small image defects which appear in the non-image areas of the 40 % screen (110 lpi) . The better the pre-heat latitude, the higher the maximum ^asteroid'-free pre-heat temperature (TJJ^(*asteroid'-<br>
free)). The results of the visual inspection for each pre-heat temperature are summarized in table 3.<br><br>
From the results listed in table 3 it can be seen, that the maximum * asteroid' -frees pre-heat temperature (Tj^x (*asteroid'-free))   a.<br>
for the comparative example is 116BC.<br>
Examples 1 to 4<br>
The preparation of the printing plate precursor was identical to the comparative example 1, with the exception, that a radical stabilizer was added to the photolayer. The photolayer compositions are listed in table 4.<br><br><br>
The pre-heat latitude of the printing plate precursor was evaluated as described in comparative example 1. Both the â–º  sensitivity and the Tmax( ^asteroid' -free) were determined. The<br>
results are summarised in table 5.<br><br><br>
The examples 1 to 4 demonstrate, that the use of radical stabilizing compounds in the photolayer leads to an improved preheat latitude.<br>
Examples 5 to 10 and comparative examples 2 to 4<br>
Preparation and coating of the photosensitive layer<br>
A composition was prepared (pw â–  parts per weight; wt.% = weight percentage) by mixing the ingredients as specified in table 6. This composition was coated on an electrochemically roughened and anodically oxidized aluminum sheet, the surface of which has been rendered hydrophilic by treatment with an aqueous solution of poly(vinylphosphonic acid) (oxide weight 3 g/ma) and was dried at 105 Â°C. The resulting thickness of the layer was 1.5 g/m2.<br><br>
Preparation and coating of the protective overcoat layer<br><br>
On top of the photosensitive layer a solution in water (containing 4.0 wt.%) of the composition as defined in table 7 was coated and then was dried at 120 Â°C.<br><br>
The protective overcoat for the examples and the comparative examples was coated- at different dry coating weights as defined in i: table 8.<br>
The pre-heat latitude of the printing plate precursors was evaluated as described in comparative example 1. Both the sensitivity and the Tmax (*asteroid'-free) were determined. Additionally the plate was inspected for defects i.e. non hardened defects in an image area. The results are summarised in table 8.<br><br><br>
The examples demonstrate that reducing the dry coating weight 5  below 2.0 g/m2 leads to a significant improvement in pre-heat<br>
latitude according to the present invention, AtH a low dry coating weight of 0.25 g/m2 the image areas show defects (non hardened areas in image areas) and the sensitivity is slightly reduced (i.e. a higher value is obtained) .<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
