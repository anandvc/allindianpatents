				<td>Method and device for producing a container<br>
The present invention relates to a method for producing a container consisting of a<br>
substantially stiff outer container and an easily deformable inner pouch which are<br>
made from thermoplastic materials that do not form a heat-sealed or welded joint<br>
with one another, the container comprising a container opening and the outer<br>
container at least one wall opening by which pressure is compensated in the space<br>
between the inner pouch and the outer container when the inner pouch contracts<br>
due to the discharge of its contents. In the method, a parison, which consists of at<br>
feast two tubings, is coextruded and arranged between the opened halves of a blow<br>
mold, the blow mold being closed when the parison has reached the length required<br>
for producing the container. Excess material is squeezed off in the bottom area of<br>
the container to be produced and, preferably, an outwardly projecting web is formed<br>
from welded material of the outer container, in which web the welded bottom seam of<br>
the inner pouch is clamped and held in axial direction. The parison is then inflated<br>
by a pressure medium, in general compressed air, for contact with the wall of the<br>
blow mold and is removed from the blow mold.<br>
Such a method is e.g. known from DE 196 26 967 C2. It is also disclosed in this<br>
document that the at least one wall opening is formed in that the wall of the outer<br>
container is pierced or punctured by a drill, graver or a piercing needle, a pressure<br>
medium being blown or injected against the wall of the inner pouch after complete<br>
penetration of the wall of the outer container to press the pouch back so that it is not<br>
damaged by the drill or piercing needle. The pressure medium may be air, gas,<br>
water or a gel.<br><br>
Although the different thermoplastic materials of the outer container and the inner<br>
pouch do not form a welded joint with one another, they adhere to each other when<br>
the container is produced in a coextrusion process according to the above-described<br>
method. Before such a container can be used, i.e. before being filled with a liquid or,<br>
for example, also gel-like container contents which is then gradually discharged, for<br>
example, by means of an airless pump or in the case of a squeeze container by the<br>
container being squeezed, the inner pouch must be removed or detached at least for<br>
its greatest part from the wall of the outer container and must then be placed on the<br>
wall again. This has so far been done by applying a negative pressure or vacuum to<br>
the inner pouch through the container opening, the inner pouch thereupon<br>
contracting suddenly. In this process the inner pouch which is clamped with its<br>
bottom seam in the bottom web of the outer container detaches from the outer<br>
container in a more or less uncontrolled manner, and it may e.g. happen that the<br>
inner pouch only detaches at one side. Subsequently a pressure medium, in general<br>
compressed air, is introduced through the container opening into the inner pouch to<br>
bring said pouch again into contact with the outer container so that the inner pouch<br>
has the intended filling volume. When the container has the shape of a bottle with a<br>
neck which passes through shoulder sections into the e.g. cylindrical body of the<br>
outer container, it is often unavoidable under the known procedure that air gets<br>
entrapped in the transition area of the shoulder to the main body of the outer<br>
container between the outer container and the inner pouch, which air can no longer<br>
escape. This also happens whenever the body of the outer container does not<br>
extend along a straight line, e.g. cylindrically, but has indentations and bulges.<br>
In cases where the inner pouch has not been detached from the wall of the outer<br>
container in a substantially uniform manner, a relatively high negative pressure<br>
arises, despite pressure compensating openings in the wall of the outer container, in<br>
the inner pouch due to the discharge of filling material. The higher this negative<br><br>
pressure, the greater is the permeation through the wall of the inner pouch and the<br>
greater is the risk that the pouch will teak. If the negative pressure in the inner pouch<br>
is too high, this may entail inoperativeness of the pump, which is most of the time<br>
provided, so that it is not possible to discharge the whole contents of the container. It<br>
may also happen that the negative pressure is so high at the beginning that outer<br>
bottle and inner bottle will fold at the same time until the negative pressure reaches<br>
a value which enables the inner pouch to detach suddenly.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to develop a method of the above-mentioned<br>
kind such that the inner pouch can be detached in a controlled manner and as<br>
uniformly as possible from the outer container and can again be placed against the<br>
outer container substantially without the inclusion of air (or of another pressure<br>
medium) between the inner wall of the outer container and the inner pouch.<br>
Moreover, a device shall be indicated for producing the container with these<br>
properties.<br>
Said objects are achieved according to the invention by the features of patent claims<br>
1 and 10.<br>
Advantageous developments of the invention are characterized in the dependent<br>
claims.<br>
After manufacture of the container in the blow mold and its removal, the method of<br>
the invention provides the following steps, which are preferably carried out in the<br>
device of the invention:<br>
a) The container opening is sealed, which is preferably done by means of a plug<br>
which is tightly pressed into the container opening, mostly a container neck.<br><br>
Thereupon, the at least one wall opening is formed in a manner known per se in that<br>
the wall of the outer container is penetrated or punctured by a drill or a piercing<br>
needle, and once the wall of the outer container has been fully penetrated, a<br>
pressure medium, preferably compressed air, is introduced into the space between<br>
the container and the inner pouch. The pressure medium is preferably ejected from a<br>
channel at the head end of the drill or the piercing needle and blown against the<br>
opposite area of the inner pouch which is pressed back by the medium subjected to<br>
a high pressure. As a result, the internal pressure in the inner pouch rises. The<br>
pressure in the inner pouch is preferably sensed by a pressure sensor arranged<br>
therein. If a predetermined first pressure threshold value, which is preferably in a<br>
very small order of about 0.05 bar, has been reached and sensed by the sensor, a<br>
control device immediately stops the advance movement of the drill or the piercing<br>
needle, thereby reliably preventing damage to the wall of the inner pouch. The<br>
introduction of the pressure medium into the space between the outer container and<br>
the inner pouch will be continued until a predetermined second pressure threshold<br>
value is sensed in the inner pouch, said second pressure threshold value being<br>
indicative that the inner pouch has detached from the outer container to the desired<br>
extent and up to the intended container height. Once the second threshold value,<br>
which may e.g. be 0.15 bar, has been reached, the introduction of the pressure<br>
medium into the space between the outer container and the inner pouch is stopped.<br>
While the first pressure threshold value rs set to be so low that it virtually<br>
corresponds to the first measurable pressure rise in the inner pouch that indicates<br>
that the drill or the piercing needle or an appropriate tool has penetrated the wall of<br>
the outer container, the second pressure threshold value is defined in response to<br>
the container size, the container shape, the material used, etc. such that an optimum<br>
detachment of the inner pouch takes place.<br><br>
If the container has e.g. sharp-angled edges, as may occur in broad shoulder<br>
regions of a bottle, especially when the shoulder regions extend at a right angle<br>
relative to the circumferential wall of the container or if the container comprises<br>
bulges or constrictions where there is the risk that air will be entrapped at said<br>
places when the further upwardly detached inner pouch is again pressed against the<br>
container wall, the second threshold value is set at such a level that the detachment<br>
process is stopped before the critical ranges are reached. The associated pressure<br>
threshold value can be determined in corresponding tests. The second threshold<br>
value must always be matched with the respective container type.<br>
When the process of introducing the pressure medium into the space between the<br>
outer container and the inner pouch is stopped and the detachment process is thus<br>
terminated, said space is pressure-relieved in that the drill or the piercing needle is<br>
expediently retracted from the hole in the wall.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the method, steps b) through d) are carried out twice in<br>
that a wall opening is formed preferably at both sides of a plane comprising the<br>
bottom seam and the central longitudinal axis of the container and the pressure<br>
medium is introduced there, it is here within the scope of the invention that it is also<br>
possible to form more wall openings at both sides of the plane and the steps of the<br>
invention can be carried out more often in a corresponding manner.<br>
The wall openings may here be formed virtually on every portion of the outer<br>
container, e.g. on the bottom, the two wall openings or holes being expediently<br>
opposite each other along a line which bisects the bottom seam and extends at a<br>
right angie relative thereto. The formation of the wall openings approximately at half<br>
the height in the circumferential wall of the outer container is particularly expedient if<br>
a squeeze type container is concerned in the case of which the contents of the<br>
container is not discharged by an airless pump, but is discharged by squeezing the<br><br>
outer container. The two wall openings can here be dosed by the user's fingers to<br>
facilitate the discharge of the container contents.<br>
Of course, the container openings may also be formed in the shoulder region.<br>
With particular advantage the inventive steps b) to d) are carried out one after the<br>
other only on one wall opening, and these steps are then taken for the other wall<br>
opening(s).<br>
Once the inner pouch has been detached on all wall openings to the desired extent<br>
after completion of the method steps b) through d), a pressure medium is introduced<br>
into the inner pouch through the container opening, e.g. through the plug in the<br>
bottle neck, after pressure reiief of the space between the outer container and the<br>
inner pouch so as to place the inner pouch, which has detached from the container<br>
wall, against said wall again. To this end it is suggested with great advantage that a<br>
predetermined volume of a medium subjected to a predetermined pressure should<br>
be introduced into the inner pouch in that a biased compressed-air source is<br>
connected to the interior of the inner pouch by opening a valve, and that the<br>
pressure produced thereby in the inner pouch should be measured. This<br>
measurement value of the pressure is in correlation with the filling volume of the<br>
inner pouch and shows whether, as intended, said pouch has come into full contact<br>
with the outer container or whether air inclusions have reduced the filling volume,<br>
whereby the container would become useless (if an associated tolerance limit is<br>
exceeded).<br>
Furthermore, the progress of said internal pressure is measured, which is indicative<br>
whether the inner pouch is leak-proof.<br><br>
Such a quality control of the volume and leak test is carried out in the device of the<br>
invention on every container and represents an important aspect of the present<br>
invention.<br>
In further details, it is suggested that a respective bulge of the outer container should<br>
each time be formed in the blow moid in the area of the intended wall openings, e.g.<br>
in the form of a flat spherical section with a corresponding inner indentation on which<br>
the inner pouch rests. When the drill has penetrated said spherical cap-shaped wall<br>
section in a direction perpendicular to or at an inclined angle relative to the wall<br>
surface and the pressure medium is blown against the a/so spherical cap-shaped<br>
section of the inner pouch, the last-mentioned section will suddenly fold inwards,<br>
whereby contact with the drilling tool or graver is reliably prevented.<br>
The apparatus of the invention preferably includes two separated drilling stations<br>
with a controlled drive and a controlled fast advance movement, the angle of<br>
incidence of the drilling tools and their position being adjustable.<br>
Under a further advantageous aspect of the invention, compressed air is introduced<br>
into the inner pouch following step a), i.e. after sealing of the container opening by<br>
means of an appropriate plug, a pressure being here built up that is smaller than the<br>
pressure of the medium introduced into the space between the outer container and<br>
the inner pouch. This counter-pressure acts as a buffer which prevents a situation<br>
where the inner pouch is "shot away" upwards in an undesired manner, for example,<br>
beyond an edge of the container by the compressed air introduced into the space<br>
between the outer container and the inner pouch. The detaching operation is carried<br>
out in a particularly controlled uniform manner by the counter-pressure inside the<br>
inner pouch. The internal pressure can be relieved or reduced with an increasing<br>
detachment of the inner pouch and thus accompanying volume reduction, e.g. by<br>
means of an appropriate valve, which however need not necessarily be the case.<br><br>
After the counter-pressure has been built up, the pressure sensor is expediently set<br>
to zero.<br>
Hence, the inner pouch is detached in preferably two separate cycles operating with<br>
the same or different pressure threshold values that must be defined before the<br>
method is carried out.<br>
Each of the sealing plugs that are expediently used for sealing the container opening<br>
is preferably provided with a hole for a sensor provided in the inner pouch, or for the<br>
line thereof, and for an air counter-pressure valve by which the compressed air is<br>
introduced into the inner pouch. The counter-pressure acting as the buffer may be<br>
up to about 0.2 bar, depending on the container. In an alternative embodiment, only<br>
one opening is provided with a switch valve.<br>
The device of the invention comprises a container transfer station which is either of a<br>
manual or automatic kind or communicates with the blow molding machine. At an<br>
insertion station the containers are inserted into a workpiece carrier. For example<br>
four containers are here arranged in a row onto which a transverse yoke moves<br>
down from above and seals the container with the sealing plug. Furthermore, the<br>
device according to the invention preferably comprises two drilling stations, one<br>
station for volume testing, one station for leak testing and preferably a camera<br>
station for checking the sealing surface and the detachment height, and a chip<br>
sucking device. Furthermore, the outlet of the apparatus is provided with a<br>
good/poor quality switch for quality assurance, those containers being sorted out as<br>
"poor" that have not passed the volume and/or leak test and in the case of which the<br>
second pressure threshold value has not been reached, so that the inner pouch has<br>
here not detached to an adequate degree.<br><br>
Moreover, the pressure values are collected by a data acquisition means of the<br>
device during drilling and in the voiume and teak test.<br>
The materials used for the outer container are for example PP, PET-G and Surlyn<br>
whereas the materials for the inner pouch may e.g. be Lupolen or Surlyn. The inner<br>
pouch may e.g. consist of three layers, e.g. EVOH, bonding agent layer, Surlyn or<br>
Lupolen. It goes without saying that this information on the materials is only by way<br>
of example and not limiting.<br><br>
