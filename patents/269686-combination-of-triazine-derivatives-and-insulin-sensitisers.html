				<td>COMBINATION OF TRIAZINE DERIVATIVES AND INSULIN SENSITISERS.<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition of triazine derivatives or described pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof with an insulin sensitiser, for the manufacture of a medicament that can be used in the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes and pathologies associated with insulin resistance syndrome.<br>
Technical background<br>
"Diabetes mellitus" (or diabetes) is one of the most prevalent diseases in the world today. Individuals suffering from diabetes have been divided into two classes, namely type I or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and type II or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) accounts for approximately 90% of all diabetics, and is estimated to affect 12 to 14 million adults in the United States alone (6.6% of the population). NIDDM is characterised both by fasting hyperglycaemia and exaggerated postprandial increases in plasmatic glucose levels. NIDDM is associated with a variety of long-term complications, including microvascular diseases, such as retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy, and macrovascular diseases, such as coronary heart disease. Numerous studies in animal models show a causal relationship between long-term complications and hyperglycaemia. Recent results obtained by the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and the Stockholm Prospective Study have for the first time demonstrated this relationship in man by showing that insulin-dependent diabetics have a substantially lower risk of development and progression of these complications if they are subjected to tighter glycaemic control. Tighter control is also expected to benefit NIDDM patients.<br>
Hyperglycaemia in the case of NIDDM is associated with two biochemical anomalies, namely insulin resistance and insufficiency of insulin secretion.<br>
The initial treatment of NIDDM is based on a controlled diet and controlled physical exercise, since a considerable number of diabetics are over-<br><br>
weight or obese (-67%) and since loss of weight can improve insulin secretion and sensitivity to insulin and lead to normal glycaemia.<br>
Patients suffering from a hyperglycaemia that cannot be controlled solely by a diet and/or physical exercise are then treated with oral antidiabetics.<br>
A number of categories of oral antidiabetics are currently used in mono-therapy for the treatment of NIDDM:<br>
•	insulin  secretion  stimulators.   They  are   represented,  firstly,   by<br>
sulfonylureas (SU) and by "glinides". As regards SUs, mention will be made in<br>
particular of carbutamide (GlucidoraKE)), glibenclamide/glyburide (Daonil®), Eu-<br>
glucan®), glibomuride (Glutril®), gliclazide (Diamicron®), glimepiride (Amarel®)<br>
and glipizide (Glibenese®). As regards the "giinides", mention will be made in<br>
particular of repaglinide (NovoNorm®);<br>
•	agents that reduce glucogenesis, represented by the biguanides.<br>
Mention will be made in particular of metformin (Glucophage®, Stagid®);<br>
•	insulin sensitisers, represented mainly by thiazolidinediones (TZD).<br>
Mention will be made in particular of pioglitazone (Actos®) and rosiglitazone<br>
(Avandia®);<br>
•	alpha-glucosidase inhibitors. Mention will be made in particular of<br>
acarbose (Glucor®) and miglitol (Diastabol®).<br>
However, the monotherapy may show a loss of efficacy over time. This is referred to as "secondary deficiency". This may represent up to 50% unsatis-factory response after 10 years of treatment. The studies conducted have shown that it is possible to deal with this problem by combining in the same pharmaceutical form metformin with TZDs (EP 869 796 B1 or EP 861 666 B1).<br>
Moreover, the combination metformin + rosiglitazone (Avandamet®) has been marketed.<br>
However, these metformin-based combinations have adverse effects associated with the use of metformin, in particular intestinal symptoms, such as nausea, diarrhoea and abdominal pain. Triazine derivatives with an antidiabetic effect comparable to metformin have been described in WO 01/55122. However, their combination has never been suggested.<br><br>
The applicant has developed a novel pharmaceutical composition comprising an antidiabetic agent of triazine type, such as those described in WO 01/55122 and an insulin sensitiser.<br>
Unexpectedly, the combinations according to the invention show syner-gistic activity and significantly reduce the side effects of the known combinations.<br>

The pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention are useful in the treatment of pathologies associated with insulin resistance syndrome (syndrome X).<br><br>
Insulin resistance is characterised by a reduction in the action of insulin (cf. Presse Medicate, 1997, 26 (No. 14), 671-677) and is involved in a large number of pathological conditions, such as diabetes and more particularly non-insulin-dependent diabetes (type II diabetes or NIDDM), dyslipidaemia, obesity and arterial hypertension, and also certain microvascular and macrovascular complications, for instance atherosclerosis, retinopathy and neuropathy.<br>
In this respect, reference will be made, for example, to Diabetes, vol. 37, 1988,1595-1607; Journal of Diabetes and its Complications, 1998,12, 110-119 or Horm. Res., 1992, 38, 28-32.<br>
The aim of the present invention is to propose a pharmaceutical composition for significantly improving the condition of diabetics.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention especially have hypo-glycaemiant activity.<br>
The compounds of the formula (I) are therefore useful in the treatment of pathologies associated with hyperglycaemia.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition comprising the triazine compound of the formula (I) in combination with an insulin sensitiser can be prepared by mixing together the various active principles, either all together or independently with a physiologically acceptable support, an excipient, a binder, a diluent, etc. It is then administered orally or non-orally, for instance via the parenteral, intravenous, cutaneous, nasal or rectal route. If the active principles are formulated independently, the corresponding formulations can be mixed together extemporaneously using a diluent and are then administered or can be administered independently of each other, either successively or sequentially.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention include formulations, such as granules, powders, tablets, gel capsules, syrups, emulsions and suspensions, and also forms used for non-oral administration, for instance injections, sprays or suppositories.<br>
The pharmaceutical forms can be prepared via the known conventional techniques.<br>
The preparation of an orally administered solid pharmaceutical form will be performed by the following process: an excipient (for example lactose, sucrose, starch, mannitol, etc.), a disintegrant (for example calcium carbonate,<br><br>
calcium carboxymethylcellulose, alginic acid, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, colloidal silicon dioxide, sodium croscarmellose, Crospovidone, guar gum, magnesium aluminium silicate, microcrystalline cellulose, cellulose powder, pregelatinised starch, sodium alginate, starch glycolate, etc.), a binder (for example alpha-starch, gum arabic, carboxymethylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, hydroxypropylcellulose, alginic acid, carbomer, dextrin, ethylcellulose, sodium alginate, maltodextrin, liquid glucose, magnesium aluminium silicate, hydroxy-ethylcellulose, methylcellulose, guar gum, etc.) and a lubricant (for example talc, magnesium stearate, polyethylene 6000, etc.) are, for example, added to the active principle(s) and the mixture obtained is then tabletted. If necessary, the tablet can be coated via the known techniques, in order to mask the taste (for example with cocoa powder, mint, bomeol, cinnamon powder, etc.) or to allow enteric dissolution or sustained release of the active principles. The coating products that can be used are, for example, ethylcellulose, hydroxymethyl-cellulose, polyoxyethylene glycol, cellulose acetophthalate, hydroxypropyl-methylcellulose phthalate and Eudragit® (methacrylic acid-acrylic acid copoly-mer), Opadry® (hydroxypropylmethylcellulose + macrogol + titanium oxide + lactose monohydrate). Pharmaceutically acceptable colorants may be added (for example yellow iron oxide, red iron oxide, quinoline yellow lake, etc.). Pharmaceutical forms, such as tablets, powders, sachets and gel capsules can be used for an oral administration.<br>
The liquid pharmaceutical forms for oral administration include solutions, suspensions and emulsions. The aqueous solutions can be obtained by dissolving the active principles in water, followed by addition of flavourings, colorants, stabilisers and thickener, if necessary. In order to improve the solubility, it is possible to add ethanol, propylene glycol or other pharmaceutically acceptable non-aqueous solvents. The aqueous suspensions for oral use can be obtained by dispersing the finely divided active principles in water with a viscous product, such as natural or synthetic gums, resins, methylcellulose or sodium carboxymethylcellulose.<br>
The pharmaceutical forms for injection can be obtained, for example, by the following process. The active principle(s) is (are) dissolved, suspended or emulsified either in an aqueous medium (for example distilled water, physiologi-<br><br>
cal saline, Ringer's solution, etc.) or in an oily medium (for example a plant oil, such as olive oil, sesameseed oil, cottonseed oil, com oil, etc., or propylene gly-col), with a dispersant (for example Tween 80, HCO 60 (Nikko Chemicals), polyethylene glycol, carboxymethylcellulose, sodium alginate, etc.), a preserving agent (for example methyl p-hydroxybenzoate, propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, benzyl alcohol, chlorobutanol, phenol, etc.), an isotonicity agent (for example sodium chloride, glycerol, sorbitol, glucose, etc.) and also other additives, such as, if desired, a solubilising agent (for example sodium salicylate, sodium acetate, etc.) or a stabiliser (for example human serum albumin).<br>
A pharmaceutical form for external use can be obtained from a solid, semi-solid or liquid composition containing the active principle(s). For example, to obtain a solid form, the active principle(s) is (are) treated, alone or as mixtures, with excipients (for example lactose, mannitol, starch, microcrystalline cellulose, sucrose, etc.) and a thickener (for example natural gums, cellulose derivatives, acrylic polymers, etc.) so as to convert them into powder. The liquid pharmaceutical compositions are prepared in substantially the same way as the forms for injection, as indicated previously. The semi-solid pharmaceutical forms are preferably in the form of aqueous or oily gels or in the form of a pomade. These compositions may optionally contain a pH regulator (for example carbonic acid, phosphoric acid, citric acid, hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide, etc.) and a preserving agent (for example p-hydroxybenzoic acid esters, chlorobutanol, benzalkonium chloride, etc.) and also other additives.<br>
The daily doses of the insulin sensitisers are between 0.5 mg and 50 mg.<br>
More particularly, if, in the present invention, rosiglitazone is used, the daily dose is between 1 mg and 8 mg, more preferably 4 mg. If pioglitazone is used, the daily dose is between 15 mg and 45 mg. If muraglitazar is used, the daily dose is between 0.5 mg and 20 mg, preferably 5 mg.<br>
The daily doses of the compounds of the formula (I) are between 200 mg and 2000 mg.<br>
The relative proportion of the constituents of the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention takes into account the recommended dosages of the respective active principles. These relative proportions of insulin sensitisers, or of pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and of the compounds of the<br><br>
formula (I), or of pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, thus vary in consequence. Preferably, the weight ratio of insulin sensitiser to the compound of the formula (I) ranges between 1/2 and 1/2000, more particularly from 1/4 to 1/2000 and especially from 1/5 to 1/2000. The frequency of administration of the compounds of the invention is between 1 and 2 administrations per day. In the case where the doses of compounds of the formula (I) necessitate more than one daily administration, the amounts of insulin sensitisers and the insulin sensi-tiser/compound of the formula (I) ratios are adjusted in consequence.<br>
The aim of the present invention is also to propose a method of treatment via co-administration of effective amounts of a compound of the formula (I) and of an insulin sensitiser, and also kits for allowing this co-administration.<br>
The present invention also relates to kits that are suitable for the treatment by the methods described above. These kits comprise a composition containing the compound of the formula (I) in the dosages indicated above and a second composition containing the insulin sensitisers in the dosages indicated above, for a simultaneous, separate or sequential administration, in effective amounts according to the invention.<br>
The term "co-administration" means the simultaneous, separate or sequential administration of one or more compounds to the same patient, over a period that may be up to 2 hours or even up to 12 hours. For example, the term co-administration includes (1) a simultaneous administration of the two compounds, (2) an administration of the first, followed 2 hours later by the administration of the second compound, (3) an administration of the first, followed 12 hours later by the administration of the second compound.<br>
The examples below of compositions according to the invention are given as non-limiting illustrations.<br><br>

Biological test: Modulation of glucose levels with the combinations of the invention with insulin sensitisers<br>
The capacity of the compounds of the invention in combination with insulin-sensitising antidiabetic compounds to modify the blood glucose levels is evaluated in vivo in diabetic GK rats.<br>
Alone or in combination, the antidiabetic agents are administered twice a day (bid) to the GK rats for 4 days. The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is performed after the last day of treatment.<br>
OGTT is performed in the morning after 3 hours of fasting by oral administration of a glucose charge of 2 g/kg of body mass. The blood samples are collected from the tail vein at 0; 10; 20; 30; 45; 60; 90 and 120 minutes to determine the glucose levels.<br>
Results for the combinations according to the invention<br>
The combination of rosiglitazone and of the hydrochloride salt of (+)-2-amino-3,6-dihydro-4-dimethylamino-6-methyl-1,3,5-triazine was tested as follows. The two compounds were administered alone and in combination. The doses used for the hydrochloride salt of (+)-2-amino-3,6-dihydro-4-dimethyl-amino-6-methyl-1,3,5-triazine were 50 and 100 mg/kg PO twice daily for 4 days. For rosiglitazone, the doses used were 1 and 5 mg/kg PO twice daily for 4 days. The following combination was tested:<br><br><br>
After four days of treatment (placebo), the glycaemia of the control GK diabetic rats was not modified or increased significantly. At doses of 5 mg/kg of rosiglitazone and 100 mg/kg of the hydrochloride salt of (+)-2-amino-3,6-di-hydro-4-dimethylamino-6-methyl-1,3,5-triazine, these agents induced a decrease in the fasted plasmatic glucose level. However, better glucose tolerance was observed with the hydrochloride salt of (+)-2-amino-3,6-dihydro-4-dimethyl-amino-6-methyl-1,3,5-triazine than with rosiglitazone.<br>
In combination, rosiglitazone 5 mg/kg and the hydrochloride salt of (+)-2-amino-3,6-dihydro-4-dimethylamino-6-methyl-1,3,5-triazine 100 mg/kg showed much better efficacy than each compound individually. The combination of an insulin sensitiser, such as rosiglitazone and of a compound, such as the hydrochloride salt of (+)-2-amino-3,6-dihydro-4-dimethylamino-6-methyl-1,3,5-triazine generates better activity on the glucose tolerance and the plasmatic glucose level of each than that of the compounds.<br><br>
