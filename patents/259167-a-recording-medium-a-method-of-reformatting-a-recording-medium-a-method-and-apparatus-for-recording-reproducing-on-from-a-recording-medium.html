[DESCRIPTION]<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to managing physical access control (PAC) and recording data,<br>
media containing PAC and recording data (for example, high density optical discs, such as<br>
Blu-ray Disc) and apparatus and methods for recording and/or reproducing data to and/or<br>
. from the media.<br>
Background Art<br>
Media, for example, optical discs may be used for recording a large quantity of data. Of the<br>
optical discs available, a new high density optical media (HD-DVD), for example, the Blu-<br>
ray Disc (hereafter called as "BD") is under development, which enables increased recording<br>
and/or storing of high definition video and/or audio data.<br>
BD further includes a rewritable Blu-ray disc (BD-RE), Blu-ray disc writable once (BD-WO),<br>
and Blu-ray disc read only (BD-ROM).<br>
Currently, one problem with existing systems is the potential incompatibility between drives<br>
of different versions, for example a drive of a previous version with a previous set of<br>
capabilities may have difficulty interacting with a medium that has interacted with a drive<br><br>
including at least one capability from a subsequent set of capabilities.<br>
Another problem with existing systems is determining an initialization, re- initialization,<br>
formatting, and/or reformatting procedure for physical access control (PAC) information<br>
stored on the medium, for example, a rewritable Blu-ray disc (BD-RB).<br>

including at least one area containing status information for each of the at least one PAC<br>
clusters, the status information changing upon reformatting of the recording medium and<br>
recording the changed status information for each of the at least one PAC clusters on the<br>
recording medium.<br>
In an example embodiment, the present invention is directed to a method of reproducing from<br>
a recording medium including identifying at least one physical access control (PAC) cluster,<br>
including at least one area containing status information for each of the at least one PAC<br>
clusters, the status information changing upon reformatting of the recording medium and<br>
reproducing the changed status information for each of the at least one PAC clusters from the<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to example embodiments of the present invention,<br>
illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers<br>
will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.<br>
In an example embodiment, in addition to its ordinary and customary meaning, the term<br>
"physical access control (PAC)" may include additional information being recorded on the<br>
disc for managing/controlling data recording and reproduction for an entire disc or a specific<br>
segment within a physical zone of the disc. The term "physical access control (PAC)" may be<br>
referred to as "PAC", "PAC information", and/or "PAC control information" for simplicity.<br>
In addition, a zone within the disc on which the PAC is recorded may be referred to as a<br>
"PAC zone" and the PAC being recording in the PAC zone in cluster units may be referred to<br>
as a "PAC cluster" for simplicity.<br>
Furthermore, a PAC according to example embodiments of the present invention may include<br>
an "unknown rule", which may restrict read/write of data for the entire disc or a specific<br>
segment, for a drive having a specifically unknown PAC_ID and including a drive of a<br>
previous version (for example, a "legacy" version"). A PAC having an "unknown rule"<br>
applied thereto may be referred to as an "Unknown PAC". Similarly, a known specific<br><br>
PAC_ID recorded on the PAC may be referred to as a "known rule" and "PAC specific<br>
information" that is applied to the PAC may be referred to as a "Known PAC".<br>
In an example embodiment, a "Known PAC" may be a PAC having information related to a<br>
date of disc initialization and information (for example, Recorder ED, if one disc is recorded<br>
with many recorders, this may be useful information) on a recorder (which may be an optical<br>
disc drive) of each cluster on the disc and may be referred to as a "Primary PAC".<br>
A structure in which the PAC is recorded on the PAC zone, and apparatus and method for<br>
recording and reproducing a data by using the same will be described with reference to the<br>
attached-drawings.<br>
FIGS. 1A or 1B illustrate PAC zones on a high density optical disc in accordance with an<br>
example embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1A, the high density optical disc may be partitioned from an inner<br>
circumference to an outer circumference, into a lead-in zone, a data zone, and a lead-out zone.<br>
The lead-in zone may be further partitioned into an INF02 zone and an INFO1 zone for<br>
recording various kinds of information thereon. The INFO2 zone and an INFOl zone may<br>
include PAC (Physical Access Control) zones.<br>
For convenience, a PAC zone assigned to the INFO2 zone may be labeled a PAC2 zone and<br>
the PAC zone assigned to the INFOl zone may be labeled a PAC1 zone. One of the PAC2<br>
zone and the PAC1 zone may have an original PAC recorded thereon and the other one may<br>
have a back up zone for recording a copy of the original PAC, If a writing direction is from<br><br>
the inner circumference to the outer circumference of the disc, it may be advantageous that<br>
the original PAC is recorded on the PACII zone and the backup PAC is recorded on the PAC1 zone.<br>
FIG. 1B illustrates a diagram of a dual layer disc structure having two recording layers<br>
including first recording layer (LO: Layer 0) and second recording layer (L1: Layer 1),<br>
wherein each of the recording layers includes a Lead-in/out Zone (also called as an Inner<br>
Zone), a Data Area, and an Outer Zone 0, or i.<br>
Each of the lead-in zone (inner zone 0) and the lead-out zone (inner zone 1) may include an<br>
INFO 2 zone and an INFO 1 zone for recording management information of the disc, and the<br>
PAC zones may be located in the INF02 zone and/or the INFOl zone.<br>
Similar to a single layer disc, a PAC zone assigned to the INF02 zone may be labeled a<br>
PAC2 zone and the PAC zone assigned to the INFOl zone may be labeled a PAC1 zone. One<br>
of the PAC2 zone and the PAC1 zone may have an original PAC recorded thereon and the<br>
other one may have a back up zone for recording a copy of the original PAC. If a writing<br>
direction is from the inner circumference to the outer circumference of the disc, it may be<br>
advantageous that the original PAC is recorded on the PACII zone and the backup PAC is<br>
recorded on the PAC1 zone.<br>
In the example shown in FIG. 1B, because the PAC1 and PAC2 zones are not only in the lead-<br>
in zone, but also in the lead-out zone for the dual layer disc, the dual layer disc has a PAC<br>
size two times greater than the single layer disc.<br><br>
The PAC zone may be provided to handle problems that may occur when an older version of<br>
a drive apparatus cannot detect functions on a disc added having functions compatible with a<br>
newer version of a drive apparatus. The PAC zone may handle compatibility problems<br>
using one or more an "unknown rules'*.<br>
An "unknown rule" may be used to control predictable operations of the disc, for example,<br>
basic control of read, write, etc., linear replacement of a defective zone, logical overwrite, etc.<br>
An area may also be provided on the disc, indicating where the "unknown rule" is applicable,<br>
for example, segments for defining the entire disc or a certain portion of the disc, which is<br>
described later in more detail.<br>
In areas of the disc managed by the "unknown rule", there may be provided a DMA (Disc<br>
Management Area), a Spare Area, a User Data Area, and/or other similar areas.<br>
In areas of the disc managed by the "unknown rule", there are a DMA (Disc Management<br>
Area), a Spare Area, a User Data Area, and the like, and particularly, with regard to the User<br>
Data Area, segment areas which are predetermined areas on the disc the "unknown rule" is<br>
applicable thereto can be designated thereto. (The segment will be described in more detail,<br>
later.)<br>
That is, by using the "unknown rule", rules and/or other operations for controlling predictable<br>
operations of the above areas, such as, starting from basic operations of recording and<br>
reproducing, linear replacement of a defective area, logical overwrite of the BD-WO, and/or<br>
other similar operations may be defined.<br><br>
Thus, by defining an area of the disc, an older version drive apparatus is able to access by<br>
using the "unknown rule", a newer version of the disc reduces unnecessary access operation<br>
of the older version drive apparatus.<br>
Moreover, by defining an accessible area on a physical area of the disc for an older version<br>
drive apparatus to access by using the PAC, a data area containing user data recorded thereon<br>
can be protected more robustly and/or unauthorized access (for example, hacking) of the disc<br>
may be prevented or reduced.<br>
The INFO2 zone and the INFOl zone having the PAG3 and I zones therein in the lead-in<br>
zone may be reviewed in view of writable characteristics of the high density optical disc.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates INFO2 zone and the INFOl zone on a high density optical disc in<br>
accordance with an example embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, for an example BD-RE high density optical disc, the INFO2 zone may<br>
have 256 clusters including 32 clusters of PACII zone, 32 clusters of DMA (Defect<br>
Management Area) 2 zone for management of defects, 32 clusters of CD (Control Data) 2<br>
zone having control information recorded thereon, and/or 32 clusters of BZ (Buffer Zone) 3<br>
zone of a buffer zone.<br>
The INFOl zone may include 32 clusters of BZ2 zone of a buffer area, 32 clusters of drive<br>
area which may be a drive area for storing information specific to a drive, 32 clusters of<br>
DMA1 zone for managing defects, 32 clusters of CD1 zone for recording control information,<br>
and/or a BZ1-PACI zone utilizable as the PAC zone.<br><br>
For a write once high density optical disc (BD-R), the INFO2 zone may have 256 clusters<br>
including a PACII zone, a DMA 2 zone, a CD 2 zone, and a BZ 3 zone, each with 32 clusters,<br>
and the INFO1 zone includes a BZ2 zone, a DMA1 zone, a CD1 zone, and/or a BZ1-PACI<br>
zone, each with 32 clusters, and 128 clusters of drive area.<br>
For a read only high density optical disc (BD-ROM), the INFO2 zone may have 256 clusters<br>
including a PACII zone, a CD 2 zone, and a BZ 3 zone, each with 32 clusters, and the INFO1<br>
zone 256 clusters including a CD1 zone, and/or a BZ1-PACI zone, each with 32 clusters.<br>
The PAC zones of example embodiments of the present invention may be assigned to the<br>
INFO2 zone and/or the INFOl zone in the lead-in zone in 32 clusters each, according to<br>
rewritable characteristics of the high density optical disc.<br>
In an example of a dual layer disc having two recording layers, the PAC zone may be<br>
designated, not only in the lead-in zone, but also in the lead-out zone, such that one PAC zone<br>
may have 64 clusters.<br>
In a PAC zone of 32 clusters (or 64 clusters), one PAC may have one cluster, for recording a<br>
plurality of valid PACs. There also may be a plurality of one cluster sized PACs if desired. An<br>
example structure in which one PAC is recorded as one cluster is described with reference to<br>
FIG. 3.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates a diagram of a structure of a PAC recorded on a high density optical disc in<br>
accordance with an example embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, one PAC of one cluster size (32 sectors) may include a header zone and a<br><br>
specific information zone, specific to a particular disc drive (for example, optical disc drive).<br>
The PAC header zone may have 384 bytes allocated to a first sector of the PAC, for recording<br>
various kinds of PAC information, such as information on an "unknown PAC rule" and<br>
segments, and another area of the PAC zone may have information specific to the (optical)<br>
disc drive may be referred to as "known rules" recorded thereon.<br>
An example structure of a PAC recorded in above structure is described with reference to FIG.<br>
4. For convenience, in the description, particular fields of the PAC that require more<br>
detailed description will refer to drawings that illustrate the particular fields.<br>
FIG. 4 illustrates a diagram showing a structure of a PAC on a high density optical disc in<br>
accordance with an example embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG 4, the PAC may include a header portion (in an example, up to 384 bytes of<br>
the first frame)applicable to all PACs and an area having information specific to the drive,<br>
recorded thereon.<br>
An example header portion may include 4 bytes of 'PAC_ID", 4 bytes of "Unknown PAC<br>
Rules", 1 byte of "Entire Disc Flag", 1 byte of "Number of Segments", and/or 32 "segments<br>
Segment_0 ~ Segment_31 each with 8 bytes.<br>
The "PAC_ID" may provide the present PAC status and identification codes, for example, if<br>
the "PAC_ID" is '00 00 00 00h', the "PAC_ID" may indicate that the present PAC is not used,<br>
and if the "PAC_ID" is 'FF FF FF FFh', the "PAC_ID" may indicate that the present PAC<br>
zone is available for use again even if the PAC zone has been used previously.<br><br>
By recording the "PAC_ID" in predetermined bits, such as '54 53 54 OOh', the "PAC_ID" is<br>
used as a code for determining if the disc is one that the present drive can make free access.<br>
That is, if the present drive does not know the "PAC_ID" applied thus, determining that this<br>
is a case when the present drive can not understand the present PAC under a reason of version<br>
mismatch, or the like, the '54 53 54 OOh' is used as code requiring to refer to information<br>
recorded on the "Unknown PAC Rules" field.<br>
As described, the "Unknown PAC Rules" field may be used as a field that designates an<br>
operation range of a drive that can not recognize the present PAC, which will be described<br>
further with reference to FIG. 5.<br>
FIG. 5 illustrates a diagram showing a configuration of an "Unknown PAC Rules" field in<br>
accordance with an example embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, a degree of controllability of various areas on the disc may be enabled by<br>
the "Unknown PAC Rules". In this example, the "Area" column in Fig. 5 represents the<br>
controllable areas on the disc, the "Control" column represents control types, such as<br>
read/write etc., and "Number of bits" column represents a number of bits required for control.<br>
The additional bits in the "Number of bits" column may represent cases of dual layer disc<br>
with two recording/reproduction sides,<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, a degree of controllability of various areas on the disc may be enabled by<br>
the "Unknown PAC Rules", In this example, the "Area" column in Fig. 5 represents the<br>
controllable areas on the disc, the "Control" column represents control types, such as<br><br>
read/write etc., and "Number of bits" column represents a number of bits required for control.<br>
The additional bits in the "Number of bits" column may represent cases of dual layer disc<br>
with two recording/reproduction sides.<br>
"Unknown PAC Rules" may be used to control a number of areas on a disc. For example,<br>
"Unknown PAC Rules" can indicate recording controllability on Disc Management Area<br>
(DMA) zones ( which may or may not include a Disc Definition Structure (DDS) in the INFO<br>
1, 2, 3 and/or 4 zone, can indicate recording controllability on the Spare Areas in the Data<br>
Zone, can indicate recording and/or reproducing controllability on the Control Data (CD)<br>
Zone in the INFO1, 2, 3, and/or 4 zones, can indicate recording and/or reproducing<br>
controllability on the User Data Area in the Data. Zone, and/or can indicate recording and/or<br>
reproducing controllability on the "PAC cluster" in the INFO1 and/or 2 zone.<br>
The following example rule may be applicable to areas (except the "PAC cluster" area. In<br>
the case where the control type is write, for example, for Bits = b3, b5, b6, b7, etc., if an<br>
allocated bit is set to '0', this may be used to indicate an area relevant thereto is writable and<br>
if an allocated bit is set to '1', this may be used to indicate an area relevant thereto is not<br>
writable.<br>
In the case where the control type is read, for example, for Bits = b2, b4, etc., if an allocated<br>
bit is set to '0', this may be used to indicate an area relevant thereto is readable, and. if an<br>
allocated bit is set to ' 1', this may be used to indicate an area relevant thereto is not readable.<br>
With regard to the "PAC cluster" zone, in a case where the control type is write (Bits = b1),<br><br>
and if an allocated bit is '0', this may be used to indicate that overwrite on the present PAC is<br>
possible or status bits of a Disc Definition Structure (DDS) is changeable. If an allocated bit<br>
is '1', this may be used to indicate overwrite on the present PAC is not possible or status bits<br>
of the DDS are not changeable. The DDS will be described in more detail below.<br>
Also, with regard to the "PAC cluster" zone, in a case where the control type is read (Bits =<br>
b0), and if an allocated bit is '0', this may be used to indicate that the "PAC cluster" zone is<br>
readable and contents of the present cluster are transferable externally (for example, to a host<br>
or other similar device) of a drive. If the allocated bit is '1', this may be used to indicate that<br>
contents (so called known rule) of the present PAC cluster are not transferable except the first<br>
384 bytes (a header) of a first data frame, which is settable only when it is intended to control<br>
the disc by an unknown rule.<br>
In an example of the User Data Area, if a segment area which is a "special" area on the disc<br>
(which is described below) is defined, the User Data Area may be used as a field for<br>
indicating recording and/or reproducing controllability on the segment area, and not<br>
necessarily the entire User Data Area.<br>
Write controllability is applicable only to re-writable discs BD-RE and BD-R and the write<br>
controllability of a replacement area for a defective area is also applicable to the re-writable<br>
discs BD-RE and BD-R. As a result, various example features of the present invention may<br>
depend on the re-writable characteristics of the high density (optical) disc.<br>
Using the above technique, the "Unknown PAC Rules" field enables designation of a<br><br>
controllable area on the disc for a drive with a version mismatch. Moreover, the above<br>
technique may also be applicable to control access to a particular physical area on a disc at a<br>
user's option.<br>
Returning to Fig. 4, the "PAC Update Count" field in FIG 4, may indicate a number of the<br>
PAC updates, may have '0' written initially, and/or may be incremented by one every time the<br>
PAC is re-written.<br>
Further, in Fig. 4, the "Entire Disc Flag" field may be used as a field for indicating that the<br>
PAC is applicable to an entire area of the disc and the "Number of Segments" field is a field<br>
that may represent a number of segment areas to which the PAC is applicable.<br>
In an example, even in the case of b0 = 0 when re-initialization is allowed, if writing is not<br>
allowed by another write inhibition mechanism (for an example, a write protect (WP) flag of<br>
DDS), the initialization is inhibited. That is, the "Entire Disc Flag" may be operative in an<br>
OR-function with other write inhibition mechanisms.<br>
The "Entire Disc Flag" field can be used as a field applicable, not only to a case of an<br>
unknown PAC, but also to a case of a known PAC. That is, allowability of re-initialization of<br>
even a known PAC which understands the PAC_ID enabling to apply the known rule may be<br>
controlled through the "Entire Disc Flag" field.<br>
In another example, without providing the "Entire Disc Flag" field as described above, it may<br>
also be possible that the allowability of re-initialization may be indicated with one extra bit<br>
(for example, of the 32 bits of the "Unknown PAC Rule" field) as a "re-initialization flag" for<br><br>
indicating the allowability of re-initialization.<br>
Moreover, it should be apparent that functions of the "Entire Disc Flag" field are not limited<br>
to flag named as such. As is clear, the function of the "Entire Disc Flag" field is applicable to<br>
the re-initialization of a PAC, and the field may be identified as a "Initialization bit of PAC"<br>
field.<br>
Further, in Fig. 4, the "Number of Segments" field is a field that may represent a number of<br>
segment areas to which the PAC is applicable.<br>
In an example embodiment, a maximum number of segments may be allocatable to one PAC.<br>
In an example embodiment, a maximum number of 32 segments can be allocated to one<br>
PAC and information on the allocated segments may be written in "Segment_0" to<br>
"Segmental" fields, each including 8 bytes. Each of the "Segment_0~31" fields may<br>
include the first physical sector number (PSN) and the last PSN of the allocated segment area<br>
recorded thereon.<br>
Segments are described in more detail below. FIG 6 illustrates segment zones on a high<br>
density optical disc in accordance with an example embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, if required, there may be a maximum number (for example, 32) of<br>
segment areas on the high density optical disc, for applying the PA.C thereto. The maximum<br>
number of segment area may start from "segment 0".<br>
Up to the maximum number of segments can be allocated starting from "segment 0" in an<br>
ascending order for management by one PAC, and even if there are a plurality of PACs, total<br><br>
number of the segment areas managed by the PACs should not exceed the maximum number<br>
of segments.<br>
In an example, positions of the segment areas may be identified by an optical disc drive by<br>
writing the first PSN, which may indicate a starting position of the allocated segment area<br>
and the last PSN which may indicate the last position of the allocated segment area on<br>
"Segment" fields.<br>
In an example arrangement, none of the plurality of allocated segments need overlap and the<br>
starting and ending positions may be designated at boundaries of clusters.<br>
Thus, in example embodiments, the present invention may provide a plurality of PACs, to<br>
manage a number (for example, 32) segment areas, which are described in more detail below.<br>
FIG. 7 illustrates a PAC zone on a high density optical disc in accordance with an example<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG 7, a "Primary PAC" may include 4 bytes of "PAC_ID", 4 bytes of "PAC<br>
Update Count", 4 bytes of "Unknown PAC Rules", 1 byte of 'Entire_Disc_Flags", 1 byte of<br>
"number of Segments", a total of 32 "Segment_0 ~ Segment_3 1 each with 8 bytes, 2 bytes of<br>
"number of Recorder ID entries", 4 bytes of "Year/Month/Date of initial recording", 2 bytes<br>
of "Re-initialization Count", and/or a plurality of "Recorder ID for RID_Tag xxh" fields each<br>
with 128 bytes.<br>
The "number of Recorder ID entries", the "Year/Month/Date of initial recording", the "Re-<br>
initialization Count", and the "Recorder ID for RID_Tag xxh" fields of the "Primary PAC"<br><br>
may be referred to as a "known rule", which is PAC specific Info characterizing A "Primary<br>
PAC". A "Primary PAC" having such a structure is discussed below.<br>
As described above, the "PAC_ID" field may be used as a field for providing a status and<br>
identification code of the present PAC and be recorded in '50 52 4D OOh' for indicating the<br>
Primary PAC, specifically. '50 52 4D 00h' represents characters "PRM", and the last OOh bit<br>
indicates that a version of the Primary PAC is ' 0'.<br>
The "PAC Update Count" field may be used to indicate a number of updates of die Primary<br>
PAC, may be written as OOh at the time of initialization, and may be incremented by one<br>
every time the Primary PAC is re-written.<br>
The "Unknown PAC Rules" field is a field that may be used for designating an operation<br>
range of a drive that does not understand the Primary PAC identified by "PAC_ID" having a<br>
structure as shown in FIG. 5, and may be set to control the DMA area, the spare area, the<br>
control data area, the user data area, the PAC cluster area, and/or other similar data.<br>
The "Entire_Disc_Flags" field of the Primary PAC may be set to OOh for allowing<br>
initialization, and, if no segment area is allocated, the "number of Segments" field, and the<br>
"Segment_i" fields may be set to OOh.<br>
The "number of Recorder ID entries" field is a field that may be used to indicate a number of<br>
recorder IDs of 128 byte size and/or a maximum allowable number in the Primary PAC of<br>
252.<br>
The "Year/Month/Date of initial recording" field is a field that may be used for recording a<br><br>
Year, a Month, and a date of initial recording of the disc thereon and the "Re-initialization<br>
Count" field is a field that may be used for indicating a number of re-initialization of the disc.<br>
The "Recorder ID for RID_Tag xxh" field is a field having 128 bytes allocated thereto that<br>
may be used for recorder ID information for recording drive signatures of all recorders<br>
thereon. The 128 bytes of drive signature may include 48 bytes of a manufacturer's name, 48<br>
bytes of additional identification information, and/or 32 bytes of serial number.<br>
In another example, there may be a plurality of PACs, so that the plurality of PACs manage<br>
the entire disc or segment areas which can be allocated up to a maximum (for example, 32),<br>
which will be described in more detail below.<br>
FIG. 8 illustrates a PAC zone on a high density optical disc in accordance with an example<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG 8, a plurality of valid PACs, each of the same cluster size, may be written<br>
on one PAC zone (a PAC zone of INFO2 or INFO1), each with 32 clusters.<br>
As described above, a valid PAC may be defined as a zone containing the various kinds of<br>
PAC information and a maximum number (for example, 32, or 64 in the case of a dual layer<br>
disc) of valid PACs may be provided on a disc, each with one cluster size that can be<br>
allocated to one PAC zone.<br>
As described above, the valid PAC may have a PAC_ID (for example, PAC_ID = 54 53 54<br>
OOh) selected in advance according to a drive version of the optical disc having the PAC<br>
recorded thereon, and a remainder of the PAC zone may have a PAC of FF FF FF FFh<br><br>
recorded thereon if the PAC_ID is 00 00 00 00h, and the PAC zone not recorded yet is still an<br>
unrecorded PAC zone.<br>
A remainder of the PAC zone having no valid PACs recorded thereon may have a PAC with a<br>
PAC_ID of 00 00 00 00h or FF FF FF FFh, and a PAC zone having nothing record then-eon<br>
may be left as an unrecorded PAC.<br>
In an example embodiment, if a defect occurs at one PAC zone the PAC is to be written<br>
thereon, the PAC may be written at an area next to the defective area. The defect may be<br>
caused by damage to, or contamination of a disc surface, and when the defect occurs at the<br>
area the PAC is to be written thereon, the PAC information may be written on an area next to<br>
the defective area.<br>
Operations such as finding a position of a valid PAC zone from the PAC zone or finding a<br>
position of a next writable PAC zone while avoiding an area written already to require no<br>
more writing, and defective area from above PAC zone may an important matter in view of<br>
initialization and recording speed of the disc and many retries may be required for reading a<br>
defective area.<br>
In an example embodiment, the present invention decsribes a method in which status<br>
information on positions of the plurality of valid PACs, a position of the next writable PAC,<br>
and/or other relevant information may be written on a DDS (Disc Definition Structure).<br>
A DDS may be a zone containing information on the first PSN of a defect list, a position of a<br>
user data zone, sizes of spare areas, and/or other relevant information, and may be<br><br>
information written on the DMA zone of the disc as information on DMS (Defect<br>
Management Structure) together with DFL (Defect List).<br>
The information written in the DMA may be information scanned and pre-loaded in advance<br>
when the disc is loaded into a drive. Therefore, once various status information on the PAC,<br>
such as positions of the plurality of valid PACs, a position of the next writable PAC, and/or<br>
other relevant information is written in the DDS as pointers, the optical disc drive may obtain<br>
information on the PAC zone without needing to scan all the PAC zones.<br>
A DDS may include various kinds of information on status of the PAC zone and will be<br>
described below.<br>
FIG 9 illustrates a DDS on a high density optical disc in accordance with an example<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
FIG 9 illustrates a diagram showing an example embodiment of a DDS on a high density<br>
optical disc in accordance with an example embodiment of the present invention. The<br>
example embodiment of FIG. 9 illustrates a dual layer disc, but the teachings of FIG 9 are<br>
equally applicable to a single layer disc.<br>
Referring to FIG 9, the DDS may include a "DDS identifier" field, a "DDS format" field, a<br>
"First PSN of Drive Area (P_DA)" field representing the first physical sector number of a<br>
drive area, a "First PSN of Defect List (P_DFL)" field representing the first PSN of the defect<br>
list, a "Location of LSN 0 of User Data Area" field representing a position of an LSN (logical<br>
sector number) of the user data area, an "Inner Spare Area 0 size (ISA0_size)" field<br><br>
representing a size of an inner spare area 0, an "Outer Spare Area size (OSA_size)" field<br>
representing a size of an outer spare area 0, an "Inner Spare Area 1_size (ISA1_size)" field<br>
representing a size of an inner spare area 1, a "Status bits of INFOl/PACl location on L0"<br>
field having status information on the PAC1 in the INFO1 zone of the first recording layer L0<br>
recorded thereon, a "Status bits of INFO2/PAC2 location on L0" field having status<br>
information on the PAC2 in the INFO2 zone of the first recording layer L0 recorded thereon,<br>
a "Status bits of INFO1/PACl location on L1" field having status information on the PAC1 in<br>
the INFO1 zone of the second recording layer L1 recorded thereon, and/or a "Status bits of<br>
INFO2/PAC2 location on L1" field having status information on the PAC2 in the ENFO2 zone<br>
of the second recording layer L1 recorded thereon.<br>
As indicated in the above example, the DDS may provide various status information on the<br>
PAC, such as a position of cluster having valid PAC allocated thereto, the next writable area,<br>
and/or other similar information.<br>
An example of PAC status, information of a PAC zone in accordance with an example<br>
embodiment of the present invention is described in more detail with reference to FIG 10.<br>
Referring to FIG 10, two bits (for example) may he allocated to each field provided for<br>
indicating status information of the PAC zone recorded on the DDS. In the example of FIG<br>
10, 00 indicates that the PAC cluster is unrecorded, 01 indicates that the PAC cluster has a<br>
PAC with a PAC_ID - 00 00 00 00h, or PAC_ID = FF FF FF FFh recorded thereon, 10<br>
indicates that the PAC cluster is an invalid PAC (for example, due to a defect), and 11<br><br>
indicates that the PAC cluster is a valid PAC.<br>
A defect is not the only reason a PAC cluster may be identified as invalid. For example,<br>
when the PAC cluster is not readable due to "Unknown PAC Rules" too, the PAC cluster may<br>
also be identified as an invalid PAC, with 10. That is, as described above, the bit bO of<br>
"Unknown PAC Rule" may be used as a bit for indicating if the PAC cluster is readable,<br>
wherein even if the PAC cluster is re-writable in a case where the bit is set to 1, the PAC<br>
cluster is indicated as an invalid PAC.<br>
Another example of PAC status information of a PAC zone in accordance with an example<br>
embodiment of the present invention is described in more detail with reference to FIGs. 11A -<br>
1 ID, which each illustrate structures showing a PAC status information field of a DDS which<br>
indicate status information of a PAC zone<br>
FIG. 11A illustrates a structure of "Status bits of DMFO1/PAC1 location on L0" field for<br>
indicating status information of the PAC1 zone designated to the IKFO1 zone of the first<br>
recording layer L0.<br>
Referring to FIG. 11 A, the "Status bits of MFOl/PAC1 location on LO" field may have a total<br>
8 bytes (64 bits) allocated thereto starting from a byte position of 64 (for example) to a byte<br>
position of 71 (for example), wherein by indicating status information with two bits for each<br>
of PAC clusters, information on a total number (for example, 32) of PAC clusters may be<br>
indicated.<br>
Accordingly, for example, if bits b7 - b6 are 11 at a 64 byte position, this may be used to<br><br>
indicate that the first PAC cluster in the PAC1 zone on the first recording layer has a valid<br>
PAC. Also, if bits b5- b4 are 01 at a 64 byte position (for example), this may be used to<br>
indicate that the second PAC cluster in the PAC1 zone on the first recording layer has a<br>
PAC_ID = 00 00 00 00h or PAC_ID = FF FF FF FFh, indicating that the PAC cluster has a<br>
writable PAC.<br>
Also, the "Status bits of INFO2/PAC2 location on L0" field may be recorded by the same<br>
method for the PAC2 zone on the INFO2 zone on the first recording layer, which is shown in<br>
FIG 11B.<br>
FIG 11C illustrates an example structure of a "Status bits of INFO1/PAC1 location on L1"<br>
field having status information on a PAC1 in the INFO1 zone of the second recording layer<br>
L1, and FIG. 11D an example structure of a "Status bits of INFO2/PAC2 location on L1" field<br>
having status information on a PAC2 in the INFO2 zone of the second recording layer L1,<br>
wherein information on the PAC cluster is indicated as described above.<br>
In example embodiment, characteristics of a PAC of the present invention can be summarized<br>
as follows.<br>
In valid PACs, there may be "Unknown PAC" and "Known PAC" depending on whether the<br>
valid PAC understands a PAC_ID, or not, wherein the "Unknown PAC" has recording and/or<br>
reproducing control information on certain areas on the disc (for example, the DMA area, the<br>
spare area, the user data area, the PAC cluster, and/or other similar areas). The recording<br>
and/or reproducing control information on the user data area may be used as recording and/or<br><br>
reproducing control information on the segment area, if the segments are allocated to the user<br>
data area.<br>
The "Known PAC" may include specific information, specific to the PAC, and a "Primary<br>
PAC" may be defined as a type of "Known PAC", having disc initialization date<br>
information, recorder ID information, and/or other similar information.<br>
A PAC zone may have a plurality of valid PACs designated thereto and the status of various<br>
PAC of the PAC zone may be recorded in a DDS.<br>
Initialization of a re-writable high density optical disc (BD-RE) is likely. Disc initialization<br>
and preparation for using the disc again may include formatting a DMS area and a PAC and<br>
scanning and certifying to update Defect List (DFL) information. Because updating the DFL<br>
information is an option, initialization as defined in the present invention may also include<br>
formatting or reformatting.<br>
Initialization of a re-writable high density optical disc (for example, BD-RE) as defined in the<br>
present invention is intended to include re-initialization, formatting, and ref-formatting.<br>
For the initialization of a re-writable high density optical disc (for example, BD-RE), it may<br>
be necessary to first verify if an inserted disc can be initialized. Verification of whether the<br>
disc can be initialized can be made using the "Entire disc Flags" field (which may also be<br>
termed an "initialization bit of PAC") and/or a disc recording inhibition mechanism (for an<br>
example, a write protect (WP_flag) of a DDS). In an example, if a bit, bO of the "Entire disc<br>
Flags" field is set (for example, to '1') or if the recording inhibition mechanism inhibits the<br><br>
recording on the disc, initialization is not permitted.<br>
In a case where the "Entire disc Flags" field that indicates if the initialization is allowed or<br>
not is applicable to a "Known PAC", the "Known PAC" can be initialized if the "Entire disc<br>
Flags" field allows initialization.<br>
In a case where the disc is controlled by an unknown PAC, initialization may not be possible<br>
if the "Unknown PAC Rule" inhibits recording on a data zone.<br>
In a case where a disc can be initialized, various, example embodiments for initializing (or re-<br>
initializing, formatting, or re-formatting) a high density optical disc according to example<br>
embodiments of the present invention are described below,<br>
FIGs. 12A-12B illustrate a technique for initializing a PAC in accordance with an example<br>
embodiment of the present invention, wherein FIG. 12A illustrates changes of the PAC zone following initialization of the PAC and FIG. 12B illustrates a technique for recording in a<br>
DDS area, PAC related status information following initialization of the PAC.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 12A and 12B, in an example initialization method, the PAC zone is left as<br>
is, and only the DDS PAC related status information is changed.<br>
That is, as shown in FIG 12B, only DDS information that represents status information on<br>
the PAC zone is changed to a next writable state. For an example, bits 11 that indicate<br>
position information of the valid PAC are changed to bits 01 to indicate that a PAC zone is a<br>
next writable PAC zone, and bits 01 or bits 00 that indicate an original writable area is<br>
maintained as is.<br><br>
Without separate initialization of the PAC zone, this example technique enables a<br>
comparatively simple PAC zone initialization process by changing only the DDS information<br>
to identify an entire PAC zone as a writable area. A method of initialization by DDS<br>
information change, without physical initialization of the PAC zone, such as the example<br>
described above, may be referred to as logical initialization (or a logical format).<br>
FIGs. 13A-13B illustrate a technique for initializing a PAC in accordance with another<br>
example embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIGs. 13A-13B, the "Known PAC" including the "Primary PAC" is initialized<br>
and the "unknown PAC" is left as is. As described, initialization of a "Primary PAC" which<br>
may be considered a type of "Known PAC" may be possible because the "Entire disc flag"<br>
may be set to "0" (discussed below).<br>
When there is no "Primary PAC" on the disc, the disc may be initialized by setting the "PAC<br>
Update Count" field and the "Re-initialization Count" field to '0' at the "Primary PAC", to<br>
produce a new "Primary PAC". In this case, a Year/Month/Day of recording initialization<br>
may be recorded on the "Year/Month/Day of initial recording" field, and the recorder ID at<br>
the time of initialization may be recorded on the "Recorder ID for RID_Tag01" field.<br>
If there is a "Primary PAC" on the disc, the new "Primary PAC" increments a 'PAC Update<br>
Count" field value by one and sets the Year/Month/Day of recording initialization on the '<br>
"Year/Month/Day of initial recording" field. Moreover, all the recorder ID lists recorded<br>
already are erased, and a recorder ID of initial recording may be recorded on the "Recorder<br><br>
ID for RED_Tag01" field, and the "Re-initialization Count" field may be incremented by one.<br>
If the "Primary PAC" is initialized by an above method, while the "Unknown PAC" is left as<br>
is, all information on a valid PAC in the DDS remains intact, as shown in FIG. 13B.<br>
An "Unknown PAC" may be left as is at the time of disc initialization because the PAC has<br>
information not only on the user area, but also other areas (for example, the DMA area, the<br>
spare area, the control data area, and/or other similar areas) on the disc. As a result,<br>
initialization leaving the "Unknown PAC" as is, regardless of user data, is possible.<br>
FIGs. 14A-14B illustrate a technique for initializing a PAC in accordance with another<br>
example embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIGs. 14A-14B, both the "Known PAC" and the "Unknown PAC" may be<br>
initialized, including the "Primary PAC".<br>
Accordingly, referring to FIG. 14A, both an "Unknown PAC" with a PAC_ID = A (where "A"<br>
is an arbitrary designator), and an "Unknown PAC" with a PAC_ID = B (also an arbitrary<br>
designator) are initialized into next writable areas PAC_ID = 00 00 00 00h or PAC_ID = FF<br>
FF FF FFh. The "Primary PAC" may be initialized, for example, using the technique shown<br>
in FIGs. 13A-13B.<br>
Referring to FIG. 14B, bits 11 may be used to indicate a valid PAC of the "Unknown PAC"<br>
and PAC related information of the DDS may be changed to 01.<br>
FIGs. 15A-15B illustrate a technique for initializing a PAC in accordance with another<br>
example embodiment of the present invention,<br><br>
Referring to FIGs. 15A-15B , similar to FIGs. 14A-14B, both the "Known PAC" and the<br>
"Unknown PAC" may be initialized, including the "Primary PAC", while accounting for bit b1 of the "Unknown PAC Rule" into account.<br>
That is, as described above, if bit bl of the "Unknown PAC Rule", a recording control bit for<br>
the PAC cluster area, is set to 1 (for example), to inhibit rewriting on the PAC cluster,<br>
initialization of the "Unknown PAC" is inhibited, and if bit bl of the "Unknown PAC Rule"<br>
is set to 0 (for example), to allow rewriting on the PAC cluster, initialization of the<br>
"Unknown PAC" is made possible.<br>
Therefore, if it is desired to leave an "Unknown PAC" as is, regardless of the User data, it is<br>
possible to leave the "Unknown PAC" as is by using bits bl, and, for the "Unknown PAC" to •<br>
be left as is, DDS information is left as 11 as a valid PAC.<br>
FIG 16 illustrates a block diagram of an optical recording/reproducing apparatus in<br>
accordance with an example embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 9, the optical recording/reproducing apparatus may include a<br>
recording/reproducing device 10 for performing recording/reproduction on the optical disc<br>
and a host, or controller 20 for controlling the recording/reproducing device 10. In an<br>
example embodiment, the recording/reproducing device 10 may act as the "optical disc<br>
drive" discussed above in conjunction with many example embodiments of the present<br>
invention.<br>
In an example embodiment, the host 20 gives a writing or reproduction instruction to write to<br><br>
or reproduce from a particular area of the optical disc to the recording/reproducing device 10,<br>
and the recording/reproducing device 10 performs the recording/reproduction to/from the<br>
particular area in response to the instruction from the host 20.<br>
The recording/reproducing device 10 may further include an interface part 12 for performing<br>
communication, such as exchange of data and instructions with the host 20, a pickup part 11<br>
for writing/reading a data to/from the optical disc directly, a data processor 13 for receiving a<br>
signal from the pickup part 11 and recovering a desired signal value or modulating a signal to<br>
be written into a signal able to be written on the optical disc,, a servo part 14 for controlling<br>
the pickup part 11 to read a signal from the optical disc accurately or to write a signal on the<br>
optical disc accurately, a memory 15 for temporary storage of various kinds of information<br>
including management information and data, and a microcomputer 16 for controlling various<br>
parts of the recording/reproducing device 10.<br>
An example method for recording a PAC on a high density writable optical disc using the<br>
example optical recording/reproducing apparatus will be described below.<br>
Upon inserting the optical disc into the optical recording/reproducing apparatus, management<br>
information may be read from the optical disc and stored in the memory 15 of the<br>
recording/reproducing device 10, for use at the time of recording/reproduction of the optical<br>
disc.<br>
In this state, if the user desires to write on a particular area of the optical disc, the host 20,<br>
taking this as a writing instruction, provides information on a desired writing position to the<br><br>
recording/reproducing device 10, together with a data to be written.<br>
The microcomputer 16 in the recording/reproducing device 10 may receive the writing<br>
instruction, determine if the area of the optical disc the host 20 desires to write is a defective<br>
area or not from the management information stored in the memory 15, and/or perform data<br>
writing according to the writing instruction from the host 20 on an area which is not a<br>
defective area.<br>
If it is determined that writing on an entire disc or on a particular area of the disc includes<br>
new features which a previous version of the recording/reproducing device is not provided<br>
with, leading the previous version of the recording/reproducing device to fail to sense, or if it<br>
is intended to restrict functions, such as writing or reproducing to/from a particular area of the<br>
disc according to restriction set by the user, the microcomputer 16 of the<br>
recording/reproducing device 10 may write control information of the area in the PAC zone<br>
on the disc as an "Unknown PAC rule". The microcomputer 16 of the recording/reproducing<br>
device 10 may also write PAC information, such as the PAC_I0D for a written state, and<br>
segment information which is control information on the particular area of the disc.<br>
Moreover, the microcomputer 16 of the recording/reproducing device 10 may also write a<br>
PAC_ID and segment information on a particular area of the disc as PAC information, The<br>
recorder ID information may be recorded on the "Recorder ID for RID_Tag of the "Primary<br>
PAC".<br>
PAC information may be written in a plurality of valid PACs on the PAC 1 zone of the INFO<br><br>
1 zone as required at a one cluster size and a copy of the PAC recorded on the PAC1 zone<br>
may be written on the PAC2 zone of the INFO 2 zone as a backup.<br>
The microcomputer 16 may provide position information of the area the data is written<br>
thereon, or the PAC zone, and the data to the servo 14 and the data processor 13, so that the<br>
writing is finished at a desired position on the optical disc through the pickup part 11.<br>
Initialization of a high density optical disc having a PAC recorded thereon by the above-<br>
described method may be performed as described above under the control of the<br>
microcomputer 16 of the recording and reproducing device 10. Ina example embodiment,<br>
an "Unknown PAC" may be initialized when a cluster having the PAC recorded thereon is<br>
writable and initialization of the "Primary PAC" of the "Known PAC" may be made by<br>
recording information on a recorder ID and date of the initialization, and updating related<br>
count information.<br>
In another example embodiment, a method for recording to and/or reproducing from a high<br>
density optical disc having a PAC written thereon will be described.<br>
Upon inserting an optical disc into the optical recording/reproducing apparatus, management<br>
information may be read from the optical disc and stored in the memory 15 of the recording<br>
and reproducing device 10, for use at the time of recording and reproduction of the optical<br>
disc.<br>
The information in the memory 10 may include position information of various zones<br>
included in the PAC zone on the disc. Particularly, positions of valid PACs in the PAC zone<br><br>
may be known from disc definition structure (DDS) information. After positions of the valid<br>
PACs are known, a PAC_ID field of the PAC may be examined, for verifying if the PAC_ID<br>
is an identifiable PAC_ID.<br>
If the PAC_IDD is identifiable, the method determines that a recording and reproducing device<br>
having written the data on the disc has a version identical to a version of the present<br>
recording and reproducing device or there are no separate writing/reproduction restrictions,<br>
and the recording/reproduction is performed according to the instruction from the host 20.<br>
If the PAC_IDD is not identifiable, determining that it is a case when there are recording and<br>
reproducing restrictions for entire disc or a segment area, the recording/reproduction may be<br>
performed according to an instruction from the host 20 from with reference to<br>
recording/reproduction restriction areas on the disc written as the "Unknown PAC rule"<br>
and/or the "Segment".<br>
The microcomputer 16 may then provide the location information and data according to the<br>
instruction from the host to the servo 14 and the data-processor 13, so that the<br>
recording/reproduction is finished at a desired location on the optical disc through the pickup<br>
part 11.<br>
As described above, the methods and apparatus for recording and reproducing in a high<br>
density optical disc according to example embodiments of the present invention may have<br>
one or more of the following advantages.<br>
First, the various embodiments of updating a PAC zone and DDS information related thereto<br><br>
permits effective initialization of a high density optical disc.<br>
Second, various embodiments for recording/reproducing data using a PAC permits effective<br>
data recording/reproduction, to/from a high density optical disc.<br>
