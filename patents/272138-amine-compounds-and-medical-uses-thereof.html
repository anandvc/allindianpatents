thereof or a pharmaceutical composition thereof according to the present<br>
invention can be adimisttrated by oral, parenteral such as subcutaneous,<br>
intravenous, intramuscular or intraperitoneal route, or via an externally<br>
explanted reservoir. Oral or injection administration is preferred.<br>
In addition, it is noted that the dosage and method of use of the present<br>
compounds depend on many factors including age, body weight, gender,<br>
physical health condition, nutritional state, strength of compound, duration of<br>
administration, metabolic rate, severity of the conditions to be treated and the<br>

(0.78g, 2.44mmol) was dissolved in 50 mL anhydrous toluene. The mixture was<br>
heated to reflux, and added dropwise with the solution of phenyl chloroformate<br>
(0.46g, 2.93mmol) in 10 mL anhydrous toluene over 0.5h. The reflux was<br><br>
maintained for 1h after compeletion of the addition, and then the reaction was<br>
terminated, and cooled to room temperature. The organic phase was washed<br>
with 2.5M sodium hydroxide aqueous solution (20 ml_x3), with distilled water to<br>
neutral, then with 1.0M hydrochloric acid aqueous solution (20 ml_x3), with<br>
distilled water to neutral, with saturated sodium chloride aqueous solution, and<br>
dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The drying agent was removed by filtration,<br>
and toluene was distilled out under a reduced pressure to obtain a yellow oil.<br>
30 ml_ of 1,2-propylene glycol was added to the above yellow oil, and<br>
sodium hydroxide (0.98g, 2.44mmol) dissolved in 8ml_ of distilled water was<br>
added into the above 1,2-propylene soludion. The mixture was heated to reflux<br>
for 3h, the reaction was terminated, cooled to room temperature, added with<br>
diluted hydrochloric acid aqueous solution to reach a pH of about 3, stirred to<br>
perform the reaction at room temperature for 1h, extracted with n-hexane (20<br>
ml_x3), then added with sodium hydroxide aqueous solution to reach a pH of<br>
about 10, and extracted with ethyl acetate (20 mLx3). The organic phase was<br>
washed with saturated saline aqueous solution, dried over anhydrous sodium<br>
sulfate, filterated to remove the drying agent, distilled under vacumm to remove<br>
solvent and obtain a residue of about 15mL. The residue was added with 0.22g<br>
(2.44mmol) of oxalic acid to generate a white precipitate. The mixture was<br>
heated to reflux for 0.5h, cooled to room temperatre, and frozen for 4h. After<br>
filtration under vacumm, the filter cake was washed with cold ethyl acetate to<br>
obtain 0.30g of the target compound as a pale yellow powdery solid in a yield of<br>
31.4% and a melting point of 128-131°C. MS (m/e): 306.4 (M+H+), 328.1 (M+Na+)<br>

Example 10: Preparation of N.N-dimethyl-3-f(benzof1.41dioxan-5-vl-oxy)-3-<br>
(furan-2-vl)propvlaminel-oxalate (compound lin)<br><br><br>
3-Dimethylamino-1-(furan-2-yl)-1-propanol	(169g,	0.01 mol),<br>
5-benzo[1,4]dioxane (1.52g, 0.01 mol) and triphenylphosphine (3.93g, 0.015mol)<br>
was dissolved in 80 ml_ anhydrous tetrahydrofuran. The mixture was slowly<br>
added dropwise with the solution of diethyl azodicarboxylate (2.61 g, 0.015mol)<br>
in 20 mL anhydrous tetrahydrofuran, and the reaction temperature was<br>
controlled by an ice-salt bath to be below -5°C. After compeletion of the addition,<br>
the ice-salt bath was removed, and the reaction was performed at room<br>
temperature for 24h. After the reaction, tetrahydrofuran was distilled out under a<br>
reduced pressure, and the obtained oily liquid was dissolved in 100 mL ethyl<br>
acetate. The mixture was washed with diluted sodium hydroxide aqueous<br>
solution and saturated sodium chloride aqueous solution respectively, dried<br>
over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and separated by silica gel column<br>
chromatography to obtain 0.98g of N,N-dimethyl-3-[(benzo[1,4]dioxan-<br>
5-yl-oxy)-3-(furan-2-yl)propylamine] as a yellow oil. The yellow oil was dissolved<br>
in 30 mL ethyl acetate, and added with oxalic acid (0.29g, 0.032mol) to generate<br>
a pale yellow precipitate. The mixture was heated to reflux, cooled to room<br>
temperature, frozen for 2h, and filtrated under vacumm. The filter cake was<br>
washed with cold ethyl acetate to obtain 0.75g of the target compound as a pale<br>
yellow powdery solid in a yield of 19.1% and a melting point of 101-103°C. MS<br>

Example 11: Antidepressant effect of the target compounds<br>
as measured by tail suspension test in mice<br>
Male ICR mice (SPF grade) weighing 18-22g each was suspended by<br>
clampping separately at 1cm from the end of the tail with a clamp attached to a<br>
rope at the center of top plate of a 25x25x25 cm tail suspension box, and the<br>
head is away from the box bottom by 4-5 cm. The mice were administrated via<br>
intraperitoneal injection at 30 min before the test or via intragastric<br>
administration at 60min before the test with the compound to be tested and<br>
Duloxetine as the positive control. The tail was suspended for 6min, and the<br>
immobility time of mice during the last 4 min was accumulated. The results of<br>
antidepressant effects of the target compounds administrated via intraperitoneal<br>
injection as determined by the tail suspension test in mice are given in Table 1.<br><br>
In the tail-suspended model of mice, the antidepressant effect was<br>
evaluated by observing the immobility time of the tail-suspended mice, and the<br>
shorter the immobility time, the stronger the antidepressant effect. As seen from<br>
Table 1, the target compounds can significantly shorten the immobility time;<br>
under the same, dose, the target compounds have more significant<br>
antidepressant effect than Duloxetine; and with increasing of the dose, more<br><br>
significant effect on the immobility time was observed, indicating that their<br>
antidepressant effects are explicitly dose dependent.<br>
The antidepressant effect of compound I2 was evaluated via intragastric<br>
administration and the results thereof are shown in Table 2.<br><br>
Table 2 shows that compound l2 can significantly shorten the immobility<br>
time of the tail-suspended mice via intragastric administration; its at the dose of<br>
5mg/kg is remarkably greater than that of duloxetine at the dose of 10mg/kg;<br>
and the higher the dose, the greater the effect on the immobility time, which<br>
indicates that its antidepressant effect is explicitly dose dependent.<br>
Example 12: The antidepressant effect of the target compounds<br>
as measured by forced swim test in mice<br>
Mail ICR mice (SPF grade) weighing 18-22g were placed in a glass jar<br>
(diameter 10cm, and height 20cm) with water 10cm in depth and a temperature<br>
of 25°C, observed for 6 min, and the accumulated immobility time of mice (i.e.,<br>
the time that the animal has no motion or a slight motion in its hind limbs, but<br>
maintains body floated without motion) during the last 4min was recorded. The<br>
mice were administrated with the compound to be tested and Duloxetine as the<br>
positive control drug via intraperitoneal injection at 30min before the test or via<br><br>
intragastric administration at 60min before the test. The effects of the target<br>
compounds on the immobility time of the forced swim mice via intraperitoneal<br>
injection are given in Table 3.<br><br>
In the forced swim model of mice, the antidepressant effect was evaluated<br>
by observing the immobility time of the forced swim mice, and the shorter the<br>
immobility time, the stronger the antidepressant effect. As seen from Table 3,<br>
the target compounds can significantly shorten the immobility time; at the same<br>
dose, the antidepressant effects of the target compounds are significantly<br>
greater than that of the Duloxetine; and the higher the dose, the greater the<br>
effect on the immobility time, which indicates that their antidepressant effects<br>
are explicitly dose dependent.<br>
The antidepressant effect of compound I2 was further evaluated via<br>
intragastric administration, and the results thereof are shown in Table 4.<br>
Table 4: Effect of the target compound on the immobility time of the<br>
forced swim mice via intragastric administration<br><br><br>
Table 4 shows that compound b can significantly shorten the immobility<br>
time via intragastric administration; its antidepressant effect at the dose of 20<br>
mg/kg is comparable to that of Duloxetine at the dose of 40 mg/kg; and the<br>
higher the dose, the greater the effect on the immobility time, which indicates<br>
that its antidepressant effect is explicitly dose dependent.<br><br>
