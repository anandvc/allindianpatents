				<td>Description<br>
(R)-2-acetamido-N-benzyl-3-methoxypropionamide (recommended INN:<br>
lacosamide) is an anticonvulsant drug useful for treating epilepsy and pain.<br>
Two methods for producing this compound are disclosed in US 6,048,899.<br>
Scheme 2 of US 6,048,899 comprises the benzylamide formation prior to the<br>
O-methylation. However, this reaction scheme results in various impurities<br>
which must be removed by chromatography which is impractical on an<br>
industrial scale. Also, the yield of the individual steps is only between 80 and<br>
85%.<br>
Scheme 1 of US 6,048,899 involves the O-methylation of an N-protected D-<br>
serine prior to benzylamide formation, N-deprotection and N-acetylation.<br>
Although this production scheme is a more promising starting point for<br>
upscaling it suffers from major deficiencies. Most importantly, the O-<br>
methylation of N-protected D-serine using silver (I) oxide and methyliodide is<br>
impractical and expensive and results in partial racemisation (about 15%)<br>
which reduces the yield of this step to 79%. Also, the removal of the S-<br>
enantiomer during production of (R)-2-acetamido-N-benzyl-3-<br>
methoxypropionamide is extremely difficult.<br>
It has now been detected, surprisingly, that the racemisation can be avoided<br>
by using alternative O-methylation methods, such as e.g. O-methylation<br>
using phase transfer catalysis or O-methylation using organolithium and a<br>
suitable methylation agent, such as dimethyl sulfate.<br>
Also, the present invention provides an improved lacosamide synthesis<br>
route, wherein the O-methylation method is selective for the alcoholic<br>
hydroxy group of the N-protected D-serine. Accordingly, compared to the<br>
unspecific methylation suggested in scheme 1 of US 6,048,899, which also<br><br>
leads to the esterification of the carboxylic group, the present invention<br>
results in a shortened, more effective synthesis, wherein the subsequent<br>
step of hydrolysing the methyl ester group of an intermediate is avoided.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to an improved method of<br>
producing (R)-2-acetamido-N-benzyl-3-methoxypropionamide comprising<br>
the O-methylation of a compound of formula I<br><br>
to produce a compound of formula II<br><br>
wherein Rx is an N-protecting group,<br>
characterised in that the O-methylation is being carried out in a one-step<br>
reaction and wherein racemisation is avoided such that the compound of<br>
formula II is obtained as an R-enantiomer of at least 88%, preferably at least<br>
90% and even more preferred of at least 95, 96, 97, 98 or 99 %<br>
enantiomeric purity.<br>
The language "one-step reaction" as used in this patent application means<br>
that when transforming a compound of formula I to a compound of formula II<br>
no significant amount (i.e. an amount of 5 Mol% or more) of ester of the<br>
carboxyl group is formed that needs to be hydrolysed in a separate step.<br>
Usually, even less than 1 Mol% of ester is formed which is then removed<br>
during the further processing to lacosamide as described further below<br>
without the need for any additional hydrolysis step.<br><br>
The inventive O-methylation can be achieved by adding to a compound of<br>
formula I, such as e.g. to N-Boc-D-serine, a methylation agent in the<br>
presence of an organo metal compound, preferably an organo lithium<br>
compound. Suitable methylation agents are e.g. dimethyl sulphate, trimethyl<br>
phosphate or methyl iodide with dimethyl sulphate being particularly<br>
preferred. The organo lithium compound is preferably an alkyl lithium<br>
compound, such as butyllithium, methyllithium or hexyllithium or an<br>
aryllithium compound, such as phenyl lithium. More preferably the organo<br>
lithium compound is t-butyllithium or n-butyllithium and particularly preferred<br>
n-butyliithium. Alternatively, other organo metal compounds comprising a<br>
metal-carbon binding may be used, such as organo zinc compounds<br>
including organo zinc halides, organo aluminium compounds including<br>
organo aluminium halides, organo tin compounds including organo tin<br>
halides or/and organo magnesium compounds including organo magnesium<br>
halides (Grignard compounds), wherein halides include CI, Br or/and I. The<br>
organo moiety may be aryl or alkyl. Preferred are Grignard compounds<br>
Alkyl-Mg-Y, or Aryl-Mg-Y, wherein Y is CI, Br or I. THF/2-methoxyethyl ether<br>
mixtures, diethoxymethane or, preferably, THF may be used as solvent. The<br>
reaction is usually allowed to proceed for at least 5 hours at O-10째C, and<br>
preferably for 7-24 hours at O-10 째C, most preferably for 9-18 hours at O-5째C.<br>
Also, the reaction may be performed at higher or lower temperatures such<br>
as any temperature between -10 and +25째C if the reaction time is adapted<br>
accordingly.<br>
If the N-protecting group Rx of the compound of formula I is N-Boc a typical<br>
reaction can be illustrated by the following scheme (step 1-A)<br><br><br>
Surprisingly, this process does not result in methyl ester formation or<br>
significant racemisation of the product. The experimental yield is 91%, with<br>
the major impurities being N-methylations (e.g. Example 1). Therefore, the<br>
yield of the methylation according to the method of the present invention<br>
using an organo metal compound may be at least 85%, preferably at least<br>
90%.<br>
Typically the amount of ester impurity after methylation using an organo<br>
metal or preferably an organo lithium compound, in particular after step 1a is<br>
significantly below 1 Mol%, preferably below 0,1 Mol% and is regularly below<br>
the limit of detection.<br>
In an alternative route the selective O-methylation of the alcoholic group of<br>
N-protected D-serine is performed by phase transfer catalysis ("PTC"). PTC<br>
is a method that makes use of heterogeneous two-phase systems - one<br>
phase being an aqueous or solid phase and a reservoir of reacting anions or<br>
a base for the generation of organic anions, whereas the organic reactants<br>
and catalysts are located in the second, organic phase.<br>
Usually, a quarternary ammonium, phosphonium or suifonium salt, such as<br>
e.g. a tetraalkylammonium halide, is used as phase transfer catalyst.<br>
Suitable catalysts and PTC reagents can be purchased from many vendors,<br>
e.g. from Sigma-Aldrich or Hawks Chemical.<br>
Accordingly, one embodiment of the present invention relates to a method of<br>
producing lacosamide, characterized in that a compound of formula I is O-<br>
methylated to a compound of formula II by performing the reaction as a<br>
phase transfer catalysis.<br>
Typically this method comprises the addition of a methylation reagent, such<br>
as dimethylsulfate, methyl iodide or trimethyl phosphate to a phase transfer<br>
reaction system comprising the compound of formula I, an aqueous phase,<br>

aralkyl groups, Q is a nitrogen or phosphorus and X is a halide,<br>

to the compound of formula I<br>

(d) the amount of phase transfer catalyst is between 0.01 to 0.1 molar<br>
equivalents of the compound of formula I<br>
In the present invention, in particular in formula IV to VI "aryl" refers to an<br>
aromatic group, substituted with one ore more substituents or unsubstituted,<br>
which contains from 6 up to 18 ring carbon atoms and up to a total of 25<br>
carbon atoms and includes polynuclear aromatics. These aryl groups may<br>
be monocyclic, bicyclic, tricyclic or polycyclic and may be fused rings. A<br>
polynuclear aromatic compound as used herein, is meant to encompass<br>
bicyclic fused aromatic ring systems containing from 1O-18 ring carbon<br>
atoms and up to a total of 25 carbon atoms. In the aryl group, one to six<br>
carbon atoms may be replaced by a heteroatom, such as oxygen, sulfur<br>
or/and nitrogen. "Aryl" comprises unsubstituted phenyl; unsubstituted<br>
naphtyl; phenyl or napthyl substituted with one or more substituents selected<br>
from e.g. hydroxy, carboxy, halogen, nitro, C1-6 alkyl, C1-6 alkoxy, amino;<br>
substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryls such as pyrroyl; thienyl, indolyl, etc.<br>
In the present invention, in particular in formula IV, "aryl" is preferably<br>
chosen from unsubstituted phenyl or substituted phenyl, e.g. 2,6-<br>
difluorophenyl, p-nitrophenyl or p-toluyl. Unsubstituted phenyl is particularly<br>
preferred.<br>
In the present invention, in particular in formula IV to VI "alkyl" comprises<br>
branched or linear saturated hydrocarbon chains. Preferably "alkyl" is a<br>
branched or linear hydrocarbon with up to 20 carbon atoms, more preferably<br>
with up to 6 carbon atoms; most preferably with up to 4 carbon atoms. The<br>
hydrocarbon may be substituted with one ore more substituents or<br>
unsubstituted. Preferred examples of "alkyl" are cetyl, octyl, heptyl, pentyl,<br>
butyl, propyl, ethyl and methyl.<br><br>
In the present invention, in particular in formula IV to VI, "aralkyl" means a<br>
group aryl-alkyl wherein "aryl and "alkyl" are as defined above. Preferably<br>
"aralkyl" is benzyl.<br>
In the present invention, substitution refers to substitution of a H atom by<br>
e.g. hydroxy, carboxy, halogen, nitro, C1-6 alkyl, C1-6 alkoxy, amino.<br>
The PTC reaction is usually allowed to proceed at O-10 째C for at least 30<br>
minutes, e.g. for 0.5 to 24 hours, preferably for at least 45 minutes and even<br>
more preferred for at least 1 hour.<br>
The PTC of the present invention under the specific condition of e.g.<br>
Example 2 (step 1-B) yielded 96%. The yield of the PTC of the present<br>
invention may thus be at least 85%, preferably at least 90%, even more<br>
preferably at least 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95% or 96%.<br>
A compound of formula I is obtainable from many vendors e.g. from Sigma-<br>
Aldrich or Lancaster. N-Boc-D-serine can also be produced by reacting D-<br>
serine with di-t-butyl dicarbonate to N-Boc-D-serine in a phase transfer<br>
catalysis reaction using essentially the conditions (e.g. choice and<br>
concentration/amount of alkali, solvent, PCT-catalysts, temperature, reaction<br>
time etc) as described above, except that di-t-butyl dicarbonate is used as<br>
the reagent instead of a methylation agent.<br>
If the N-protecting group of the compound of formula I is Boc (t-<br>
Butoxycarbonyl), a preferred PTC reaction can be illustrated by the following<br>
scheme (Step 1-B)<br><br><br>
This reaction does not result in any racemisation or esterification of the<br>
product. Also, the yield is further improved with impurity levels of only about<br>
1%.<br>
Typically the amount of ester impurity after methyiation by PTC, in particular<br>
after step 1-B is well below 1 Mol%, preferably below 0,1 Mol%, and usually<br>
below the limit of detection.<br>
The process of the current invention may further comprise the step of<br>
processing the compound of formula II to a compound of formula III (Step 2)<br><br>
The benzyl amide formation can be performed by adding to a compound of<br>
formula II an amount of benzylamine in the presence of<br>
(a)	a base such as triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, 1,8-diazabicyclo<br>
[5.4.0]undec-7-ene, potassium bicarbonate or a morpholine derivative,<br>
preferably 4-methylmorpholine and<br>
(b)	an activator of the carboxyl group such as a carbodiimide or an alkyl<br>
chloroformate, preferably isobutyl chloroformate.<br>
Experimentally, the yield of the benzylamid formation under the conditions of<br>
e.g. Example 3 (step 2) was typically between 90% and 99%. Thus, the yield<br>
of the benzylamid formation of the present invention may be in the range of<br>
at least 85% up to 99,9%, preferably in the range of at least 90% up to 99%<br>
product.<br>
This step 2 has been basically described in US 6,048,899, which is included<br>
herein by reference.<br><br>
Suitable protecting groups in the method according to the present invention<br>
are e.g. t-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) or carbobenzoxy (Cbz), with the Boc group<br>
being particularly preferred.<br>
In the compound of formula III the protecting group Rx can be cleaved off to<br>
obtain (R)-2-amino-N-benzyl-3-methoxypropionamide by appropriate<br>
measures known from the art. For example, if the protecting group Rx is a<br>
carbobenzoxy group it may be cleaved off with H2, Pd/C as described in US<br>
6,048,899. If the protecting group is a Boc group this group may be<br>
conveniently removed with an acid, such as hydrochloric acid, e.g. at room<br>
temperature (step 3).<br><br>
Experimentally, the amine formation under the conditions of e.g. Example 3,<br>
step 3 typically yielded product in an amount ranging from 95% to 100%.<br>
Thus, the amine formation step in the method of the present invention may<br>
yield at least 85%, preferably at least 90%, more preferably at least 95%<br>
product.<br>
(R)-2-amino-N-benzyl-3-methoxypropionamide can then be transformed to<br>
lacosamide by N-acetylation using acetic anhydride (step 4)<br><br><br>
Experimentally, the acetylation under the conditions of e.g. Example 3, step<br>
4 typically yielded between 81% and 95%. The yield of the acetylation step<br>
in the method of the present invention may thus be in the range of at least<br>
70% up to 99%, preferably in the range of at least 80% up to 95%.<br>
This step has been also described in US 6,048,899. However, US 6,048,899<br>
suggests the use of acetic anhydride in the presence of a base, e.g.<br>
pyridine. It has now been found unexpectedly that the pure (R)-enantiomer<br>
can be also obtained effectively if the toxic pyridine is removed from the<br>
reaction mixture.<br>
One embodiment of the present invention is thus the production of<br>
lacosamide comprising a step of N-acetylation of (R)-2-amino-N-benzyl-3-<br>
methoxypropionamide with acetic anhydride in the absence of a base, in<br>
particular in the absence of pyridine. The advantage of a base-free reaction<br>
is that toxic bases, such as pyridine, can be excluded.<br>
Finally, Iacosamide can be isolated from the reaction mixture of step 4 with<br>
improved purity by crystallisation in appropriate solvents, such as ethyl<br>
acetate.<br>
Experimentally, Iacosamide was obtained under the specific conditions of<br>
Examples 1 to 4 in a yield of typically 63%-70% (using butyllithium in step 1-<br>
A) or 66% to 75% (using PTC in step 1-B). Thus, Iacosamide may be<br>
obtained by the method of the present invention in a total yield ranging from<br>
at least 50% up to 90%, preferably from at least 60% up to 80%. If an<br>
organo metal compound is employed the total yield of Iacosamide may be<br>
more preferably in the range of at least 60% up to 70%, most preferably in<br>
the range of at least 63% up to 70%. If a PTC is employed, the total yield of<br>
Iacosamide may be more preferably in the range of at least 60% up to 75%,<br>
most preferably at least 66% up to 75%.<br>
The formation of a compound of formula II from a compound of formula I is<br><br>
comprised by the method of lacosamide synthesis as described above.<br>
Subject of the present invention is thus a method for production of a<br>
compound of formula (II) from a compound of formula (I) by O-methylation<br>
as described above essentially in the abscence of methyl ester formation or<br>
significant racemisation.<br>
D-serine derivatives or L-serine derivatives or mixtures of D- and L-serine<br>
derivatives in any ratio may be used in the method of the present invention.<br>
Due to the fact that during O-methylation of the alcoholic OH-group of D-<br>
or/and L-serine derivatives in the method of the present invention, there is<br>
essentially no methyl ester formation and no significant racemisation of the<br>
product, the method of the present invention for production of a compound<br>
of formula (II) or/and of lacosamide leads to an improved yield and an<br>
improved enantiomeric purity of the product.<br>
The invention also relates to important intermediates of the current process.<br>
The most important intermediate (R)-2-N-Boc-amino-3-methoxypropanoic<br>
acid (C-936) results from the improved O-methylation step according to the<br>
present invention (see figure 1). The compound can be easily isolated from<br>
the reaction mixture as the free acid or by forming a salt, such as e.g. a<br>
cyclohexylammonium salt. Suitable C-936 salts are also regarded to be part<br>
of the invention.<br>
Also, (R)-N-benzyl-2-N-Boc-amino-3-methoxypropionamide (C-937) which<br>
results from the benzyl amide formation (step 2 of figure 1) constitutes a part<br>
of the invention.<br>
Another aspect of the invention relates to the use of C-936 or C-937 or any<br>
salt thereof as an adduct or intermediate in a method of producing (R)-2-<br>
acetamido-N-benzyl-3-methoxypropionamide (lacosamide).<br><br>
Yet another aspect of the invention pertains to a method of producing a<br>
pharmaceutical formulation by the subsequent steps of<br>
(a)	producing lacosamide by the method according to the present<br>
invention and<br>
(b)	mixing lacosamide with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention is a method of producing a<br>
compound of formula VIII comprising the O-methylation of a compound of<br>
formula VII,<br><br>
to produce a compound of formula VIII,<br><br>
wherein R4 is H, an N-protecting group, or/and a group having O-30 C atoms,<br>
and<br>
wherein R1 R2, and R3 are independently selected from H and groups having<br>
O-30 C atoms,<br><br>
characterized in that the O-methylation in being carried out in a one-step<br>
reaction and wherein the compound of formula VIII is obtained in the same<br>
configuration as the compound VII, of at least 88%, preferably of at least 90<br>
%, more preferably of at least 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% enantiomeric<br>
purity.<br>
Preferably, R1, R2, and R3 are independently hydrogen, -OH, -SH, -NH2,<br>
-NO2, -CN, -COOH, -SOH, -SO2H, -SO3H, halogen, -OR10, -SR10, -NR10R11,<br>

"The same configuration" of the compound VIII with reference to compound<br>
VII	means that essentially no racemisation takes place, or compound VIII is<br>
obtained in the same configuration as compound VII with an enantiomeric<br>
purity as defined above. If compound VII is in the R configuration, compound<br>
VIII	is also in the R configuration. If compound VII is in the S configuration,<br>
compound VIII is also in the S configuration.<br>
It is preferred that compound VII is in the R configuration.<br>
The parameter of enantiomeric purity can be applied mutatis mutandis to<br>
enantiomer mixtures. If compound VII is a mixture of the R and S<br>
configuration, compound VIII is essentially the same mixture of the R and S<br>
configuration, i.e. the ratio of the R and S configuration remains essentially<br>
unaltered, or an enantiomeric ratio as follows is obtained. The obtained<br>
enantiomeric ratio of compound VIII may be at least 88%, preferably at least<br>
90 %, more preferably in at least 95, 96, 97, 98 or 99% of the enantiomeric<br>
ratio of compound VII.<br>
"One-step reaction" has the same meaning as discussed above.<br><br>
The reaction schema of compound VII to compound VIII is a generalization<br>
of the O-methylation of the present invention of the compound of formula I to<br>
produce a compound of formula II as described above. If the compound VII<br>
is in the R configuration, R1 is H, R2 is H, R3 is H and R4 is Rx, the compound<br>
VIII corresponds to the compound of formula II and may be used for the<br>
production of lacosamide, e.g. by the reaction steps as described above.<br>
Starting from the compound II or VII, lacosamide may be produced by any<br>
suitable method to introduce the N-benzylamide group and the N-acetyl<br>
group. Therefore, in a particular preferred embodiment, the compound VII is<br>
in the R configuration and R4 is Rx. It is most preferred that R4 is Rx, R1 is H,<br>
R2 is H, and R3 is H and the compound VII is in the R configuration.<br>
The inventive O-methylation of compound VII can be achieved by adding to<br>
a compound of formula VII a methylation agent in the presence of an organo<br>
metal compound, in particular an organo lithium compound, as defined<br>
above. Suitable methylation agents are defined above. In an alternative<br>
route, the selective O-methylation of the alcoholic group may be performed<br>
by phase transfer catalysis as defined above.<br>
Specific embodiments of the O-methylation of the compound of formula VII<br>
correspond to the specific embodiments of the production method of<br>
lacosamide comprising the O-methylation of the compound of formula I as<br>
described above, in particular specific embodiments relating to the phase<br>
transfer catalysis, phase transfer catalysts, in particular as defined in formula<br>
IV, V, and VI, the phase transfer reaction system and its components, the<br>
organo metal compound, reaction conditions during phase transfer catalysis<br>
or in the presence of the organo metal compound, further reaction steps and<br>
reaction conditions leading to lacosamide including N-benzylamide<br>
formation, N-deprotection and N-acetylation, etc.<br>
The yield of the methylation of compound VII by the method of the present<br>
invention may be at least 85%, preferably at least 90% when using an<br>
organo metal compound. When using PTC, the yield of methylation of<br><br>
compound VII may be at least 85%, preferably at least 90%, even more<br>
preferably at least 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95 % or 96%.<br>
Due to the fact that during O-methylation of D- or/and L-serine derivatives in<br>
the method of the present invention, there is essentially no methyl ester<br>
formation and no significant racemisation of the product, the method of the<br>
present invention for production of a compound of formula VIII by<br>
methylation of a compound of formula VII leads to an improved yield and an<br>
improved enantiomeric purity of the product.<br>
