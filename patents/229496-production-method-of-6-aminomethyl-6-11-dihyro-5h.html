				<td>PRODUCTION METHOD OF 6-AMINOMETHYL-6,11-DIHYRO-5H-<br>
DIBENZ[b,e]AZEPIN<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a novel production<br>
method of 6-aminomethyl-6,ll-dihydro-5H-dibenz[b, e]azepin<br>
which is markedly important as an intermediate to produce 3-<br>
amino-9,13b-dihydro-lH-dibenz[c,f]imidazo[1,5a]azepin<br>
hydrochloric acid salt which is therapeutically useful while<br>
characterized by antiallergic and antihistaminic actions.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
6-Aminomethyl-6,ll-dihydro-5H-dibenz[b,e]azepin is an<br>
important compound as a raw material of medicines. Known as<br>
production methods of the aforesaid compound is a method in<br>
which 6-cyano-llH-dibenzo[b,e]azepin is allowed to react, in<br>
THF, with lithium aluminum hydride and aluminum hydride<br><br>
prepared employing 100 percent sulfuric acid (Arzneim.-<br>
Forsch., 40, 4, 440, (1990) and Japanese Patent Publication<br>
No. 3-66311.<br>
However, the aforesaid synthesis method necessitates an<br>
anhydrous THF solvent which results in heavy load in terms of<br>
cost and includes time consuming operations such as<br>
filtration of an excessive amount of inorganic substances<br>
deposited after the reaction.<br>
Further, known is a method in which 6-<br>
phthalimidomethyl-6,ll-dihydro-5H-dibenz[b,e]azepin is<br>
r<br>
isolated, which is formed by hydrogenating 2-(llH-<br>
dibenz[b,e]azepin-6-ylmethyl-lH-isoindole-l,3(2H)-dione<br>
employing formic acid as well as palladium carbon, and<br>
subsequently is subjected to hydrazine decomposition.<br>
(Japanese Patent Publication Open to Public Inspection No. 4-<br>
346988).<br>
However, since this method uses hydrazine, which is a<br>
carcinogenic substance, in the industrial production,<br>
operators' safety becomes a problem. Further, isolation is<br>
required between the hydrogenation and the hydrazine<br>
decomposition. During industrial scale production, it is<br>
well known that a decrease in isolation is desirable.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
production method which enables to avoid the use of hazardous<br>
substances as well as to shorten the process in the synthesis<br>
of 6-aminomethyl-6,ll-dihydro-5H-dibenz[b,e]azepin from 2-<br>
(11H-dibenz[b,e]azepin-6-ylmethyl)-lH-isoindole-1,3(2H)-<br>
dione.<br>
The inventors of the present invention conducted<br>
diligent investigations to overcome the aforesaid problems.<br>
As a result, it was discovered that 2-(11H-dibenz[b,e]azepin-<br>
6-ylmethyl) -lH-isoindole-1,3(2H)-dione was allowed to react<br>
with a metal hydride or a metal hydride complex, whereby it<br>
was possible to reduce the imine portion as well the<br>
phthalimide portion in one vessel. It is known in prior art<br>
(Tetrahedron Letters, 25, 20, 2093, (1984)) that phthalimide<br>
is subjected to deprotection (or cleavage) employing metal<br>
hydrides. However, it was surprising that it was possible to<br>
simultaneously reduce not only the phthalimide portion but<br>
also the imine portion in the same molecule, and even when a<br>
water based solvent was employed, the imine portion was<br>
reduced to amine resulting in almost no hydrolysis. Further,<br>
it was discovered that formed N-[(6,ll-dihydro-5-<br>
Hdibenz[b,e]azepin-6-yl)methyl]-o-hydroxymethylbenzamide was<br><br>
readily decomposable without an isolation process, and 6-<br>
aminomethyl-6,ll-dihydro-5H-dibenz[b,e]azepin could be<br>
prepared in one vessel. Thus, the present invention was<br>
achieved.<br>
Namely, the present invention include:<br>
(1)	a production method of 6-aminomethyl-6,ll-dihydro-5H-<br>
dibenz[b,e]azepin via N-[(6,ll-dihydro-5H-dibenz[b,e]azepin-<br>
6-yl)methyl]-o-hydroxymethylbenzamide which is prepared by<br>
allowing 2-(llH-dibenz[b,e]azepin-6-ylmethyl)-lH-isoindole-<br>
1,3(2H)-dione to react with a metal hydride or a metal<br>
hydride complex,<br>
(2)	N-[(6,ll-dihydro-5H-dibenz[b,e]azepin-6-yl)methyl]-o-<br>
hydroxymethylbenzamide,<br>
(3)	a production method of 6-aminomethyl-6,ll-dihydro-5H-<br>
dibenz[b,e]azepin, described in (1) in which the metal<br>
hydrides or the metal hydride complex is boron hydrides,<br>
(4)	a production method of 6-aminomethyl-6,ll-dihydro-5H-<br>
dibenz[b,e]azepin, described in (1), characterized in that an<br>
alcohol or a water based alcohol is employed as a solvent,<br>
and<br>
(5)	a production method of 6-aminomethyl-6,ll-dihydro-5H-<br>
dibenz[b,e]azepin, described in (1), characterized in that N-<br><br>
[(6,ll-dihydro-5H-dibenz[b,e]azepin-6-yl)methyl]-o-<br>
hydroxymethylbenzamide is processed with a acid or a base<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Fig. 1 shows 2-(11H-dibenz[b,e]azepin-6-ylmethyl)-1H-<br>
isoindole-1,3(2H)-dione.<br>
Fig. 2 shows N-[(6,ll-dihydro-5H-dibenz[b,e]azepin-6-<br>
yl)methyl]-o-hydroxymethylbenzamide.<br>
Fig. 3 shows 6-aminomethyl-6,ll-dihydro-5H-<br>
dibenz[b,e]azepin.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
In the present invention, the reaction is conducted by<br>
successively charging raw materials, a solvent, and a metal<br>
hydride or a metal hydride complex into a reaction vessel.<br>
Stirring is continued until completion of the reaction.<br>
Thereafter, an acid or a base is added, and the resulting<br>
mixture is heated while stirring to undergo decomposition.<br>
Subsequently, by employing a method such as extraction, 6-<br>
aminomethyl-6,ll-dihydro-5H-dibenz[b,e]azepin is obtained in<br>
the form of a syrup. If desired, it is possible to obtain it<br>
in the form of crystals by forming a salt with a mineral acid<br>
or an organic acid. Further, after formation the salt, it is<br><br>
possible to purify the resulting crystals by extracting<br>
impurities employing an organic solvent..<br>
The used amount of a metal hydride or a metal hydride<br>
complex is customarily 6-60 times with respect to the<br>
theoretical amount, is preferably 12 - 30 times, and is most<br>
preferably 12 - 20 times. When it is less than 6 times,<br>
unreactants tend to remain, while when it exceeds 60 times,<br>
such an added amount is not economically preferable.<br>
Addition may be carried out in the form of powder, or after<br>
dissolved in a solvent, the resulting solution may be added<br>
dropwise.<br>
Examples of reaction solvents employed are alcohols as<br>
well as water base alcohols. Preferred alcohols include n-<br>
butanol, isobutanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, ethanol, and<br>
methanol, as well as solvent mixtures thereof. Of these,<br>
particularly preferred is isopropanol. The concentration of<br>
water in a water based alcohol is customarily 1-99 percent<br>
by weight, but is particularly preferably 18 percent by<br>
weight. The used amount of a solvent (including water) is<br>
customarily 1-50 times by volume with respect to the weight<br>
of 2-(HH-dibenz[b,e]azepin-6-ylmethyl)-lH-isoindole-1,3(2H)-<br>
dione, is preferably 2-20 times, and is most preferably 10<br>
- 15 times.<br><br>
If desired, in order to accelerate the reaction, added<br>
may be inorganic salts. Even though not particularly<br>
limited, preferable inorganic solts are zinc chloride,<br>
magnesium chloride, and cobalt chloride.<br>
The reaction temperature is 0 °C - refluxing<br>
temperature, and is preferably 30 - 40 °C. The reaction at a<br>
temperature of 0 °C or less is not economical due to<br>
excessively low production rate.<br>
N-[6,ll-dihydro-5H-dibenz[b,e]azepin-6-yl]methyl]-o-<br>
hydroxymethylbenzamide may undergo decomposition in the<br>
presence of either acids or bases. Examples of acids<br>
employed may be mineral acids as well as organic acids. Of<br>
these, preferred are hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid,<br>
methanesulfonic acid, acetic acid, and formic acid, and<br>
hydrochloric acid as well as acetic acid is particularly<br>
preferred. Examples of bases employed may be inorganic bases<br>
as well as organic bases. Of these, preferred are salts or<br>
hydroxides of alkaline metals as well as alkylamines, and<br>
sodium hydroxide is particularly preferred.<br><br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The present invention will now be specifically<br>
described with reference to examples. However, the present<br>
invention is not limited to these.<br>
A raw material, 2-(11H-dibenz[b,e]azepin-6-ylmethyl)-<br>
lH-isoindole-1,3(2H)-dione was synthesized based on the<br>
method described in J. Heterocycle. Chem., 17, 2, 341,<br>
(1980).<br>
Example 1<br>

dione, 45.0 ml of isopropanol, and 7.5 ml of water.<br>
Thereafter, while stirring at room temperature, 1.3 g (35.1<br>
millimoles) of sodium borohydride was added over 30 minutes<br>
while maintaining a maximum temperature of 30 °C. After<br>
addition, the resulting content, in the form of a white<br>
slurry, was stirred at room temperature for 24 hours. After<br>
decomposing the residual sodium borohydride by dripping 10.7<br>
g of acetic acid into the resulting reaction composition at<br>
room temperature, the resulting mixture was stirred at 80 °C<br>
for 1.5 hours and was left standing until its interior<br>
temperature was allowed to equilibrate to room temperature.<br><br>
Subsequently, 24.0 ml of water as well as 24.0 ml of toluene<br>
was added and the resulting mixture was subjected to<br>
extraction by adjusting the pH to 11 by addition of a 25<br>
percent NaOH solution. The resulting extract was<br>
concentrated under vacuum, whereby 3.1 g of a brown syrup was<br>
prepared. The resulting brown syrup was dissolved in 1.8 ml<br>
of methanol, followed by dripping of 0.89 g of fumaric acid<br>
dissolved in 18 ml of methanol. After confirming the<br>
deposition of crystals at room temperature, stirring was<br>
carried out at 0 °C for 3 hours and filtration under vacuum<br>
was carried out. The resulting cake was washed with 1.0 ml<br>
of cooled methanol and subsequently dried.<br>

Thereafter, while stirring at room temperature, 1.3 g (35.1<br>
millimoles) of sodium borohydride was added over 30 minutes<br>
while maintaining a maximum temperature of 30 °C. After<br><br>
addition, the resulting content in the form of a white slurry<br>
was stirred at room temperature for 24 hours. After<br>
decomposing the residual sodium borohydride by adding 140 ml<br>
of 1 N hydrochloric acid into the resulting reaction<br>
composition, the resulting mixture was stirred at 80 °C for<br>
1.5 hours and was left standing until its interior<br>
temperature was allowed to equilibrate to room temperature.<br>
Subsequently, 24.0 ml of toluene was added. After<br>
separation, extraction was carried out employing 24.0 ml of<br>
toluene by adjusting the pH of the water layer to 11 by<br>
addition of a 25 percent NaOH solution. The resulting<br>
extract was concentrated under vacuum, whereby 3.0 g of a<br>
brown syrup was prepared. The resulting brown syrup was<br>
dissolved in 1.8 ml of methanol, followed by dripping of 0.89<br>
g of fumaric acid dissolved in 18 ml of methanol. After<br>
confirming the deposition of crystals at room temperature,<br>
stirring was carried out at 0 °C for 3 hours and filtration<br>
under vacuum was carried out. The resulting cake was washed<br>
with 1.0 ml of cooled methanol and subsequently dried.<br>

Thereafter, while stirring at room temperature, 1.3 g (35.1<br>
millimoles) of sodium borohydride was added over 30 minutes<br>
while maintaining a maximum temperature of 30 °C. After<br>
addition, the resulting content in the form of a white slurry<br>
was stirred at room temperature for 24 hours. After<br>
decomposing the residual sodium borohydride by dripping 5.0<br>
ml of MeOH into the resulting reaction composition, 3.0 ml of<br>
a 25 percent NaOH solution was added, the resulting mixture<br>
was stirred at 80 °C for 1.5 hours and was left standing<br>
until its interior temperature was allowed to equilibrate to<br>
