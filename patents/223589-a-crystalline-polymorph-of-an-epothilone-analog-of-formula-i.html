Preferably, the subject polymorphs are administered in a dosage of less than 100 mg/kg/day, in a single dose or in 2 to 4 divided doses. It will be understood that the specific dose level and frequency of dosage for any particular subject may be varied and will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the metabolic stability and length of action of that compound, the species, age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the<br><br>
  subject, the mode and time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, and severity of the particular condition. The subject polymorphs are preferably administered parenterally, however, other routes of administration are contemplated herein as are recognized by those skill in the oncology arts. Preferred subjects for treatment include,animals, most preferably mammalian species such as humans, and domestic animals such as dogs, cats and the like, subject to the aforementioned disorders.<br>
,The preparation of the epothilone analogs represented by formula I described in U.S. patent application Serial No. 09/170,582 produced the subject epothilone analog as an oil that can be chromatographed and purified to yield an amorphous powder.    A preferred preparation is described in a continuing application under Serial No. 09/528,526 filed on March 20, 2000, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. In this preparation, as pertains to the analogs represented by formula I, epothilone B is reacted with an azide donor agent and a buffering agent in the presence of a palladium catalyst and a reducing agent to form an intermediate represented by the formula<br><br>
A macrolactamization reaction is then carried out on the intermediate to form the analog represented by formula I. It has now been found that this analog, in its crystalline form, consists of a mixture of Forms A and B as fully described herein. The amorphous form of the epothilone analog represented by formula I can be taken up in a suitable solvent, preferably a mixed solvent such as ethyl acetate/dichloromethane/triethylamine, purified such as by silica gel pad filtration, and crystallized by cooling to a temperature of about 5°C to form a crystalline material that is a mixture of Form A and Form B. The purification step using a solvent mixture containing a component such as dichloromethane removes residual solvents from the synthesis that could interfere with the crystallization process.<br>
Generally, taking the purified material in a limited amount of ethyl acetate and<br><br>
heating the resultant slurry to about 75-80°C will cause the formation of Form A. By limited amount is meant from about 8 to 16 mL, preferably from about 8 to 12 mL, of ethyl acetate per gram of purified material. As the solution is heated, a thin slurry forms which has been found to be predominately Form B. At about 75°C the slurry undergoes a material thickening which has been found to be the formation of Form A. The slurry is held at. about 75-80°C for about an hour to assure completion of the formation of Form A at which time cyclohexane is added to the slurry in a ratio to ethyl acetate of from about 1:2 to 2:2, preferably about 1:2, and the mixture is allowed to cool to ambient temperature at which it is maintained with stirring for a period of from about 12 to 96 hours. The mixture is then cooled to about 5°C over about two hours after which the crystals of Form A of the subject epothilone analog are recovered.   Form A is afforded in good yield and purity.<br>
Alternate procedures for the preparation of Form A involve the addition of leed crystals. In the descriptions that follow, seed crystals of Form A were used, but teed crystals of Form B, or mixtures thereof can be used as well. In one such upcedure, the purified material is taken up in a limited amount of ethyl acetate as described above and heated to about 75°C, seed crystals are added and the mixture naintained for about 30 minutes. An amount of cyclohexane as described above is hen added dropwise maintaining the temperature at about 70°C. The mixture is hereafter cooled to 20°C and held with stirring for 18 hours after which it is cooled to °C and the white crystals of Form A recovered by physical separation, e.g. filtration.<br>
In a second procedure, the initial solution of material in ethyl acetate is heated 3 75°C for at least an hour until a solution is produced. The solution is cooled to bout 50°C over the course of about two hours adding seed crystals of Form A when ne temperature reaches about 60°C. Crystals begin to appear at about 55°C. The emperature is again reduced to about 20°C over a further two hours during one hour of which an amount of cyclohexane as described above is added dropwise. The final lurry is further cooled over two hours to -10°C and held at that temperature for an dditional hour. The slurry is then filtered to afford white crystals of Form A.<br>
In a further alternate procedure, the material is taken up in a larger amount, i.e.  least about 40 mL/g of ethyl acetate and the resultant slurry heated to about 80 °C ntil a solution is formed which is then cooled to about 70°C over the course of about<br><br>
 one hour. Seed crystals of Form A are added when the solution temperature reaches about 70°C. The temperature is then reduced to about 30°C over a further three    hours. Crystals begin to appear at about 65 °C. The temperature is reduced to -10°C over an additional three hours during a thirty minute period thereof a quantity of  cyclohexane as described above is added dropwise. The temperature is maintained at -10°C for a further hour. The final slurry is filtered to afford white crystals of Form A. The yield and purity of Form A by these procedures is considered very good.<br>
Form B of the subject epothilone analogs represented by Formula I above is obtained by forming a slurry of the crude material in a larger quantity of ethyl acetate, i.e. from about 40 to 50 mL per g., and heating at 70°C to 80°C for an hour to form a solution which is then held at temperature for about thirty minutes. The solution is cooled to about 30°C over the course of about two hours, crystals beginning to appear at about 38°C. The temperature is further reduced to about -10°C over one hour during which a quantity of cyclohexane as described above is added dropwise over a period of thirty minutes. The final slurry is held at -10°C over a further two hours and filtered to afford white crystals of Form B.<br>
In. an alternative preparation to that above, the crude material is slurried with a like quantity of ethyl acetate and heated to about 78°C to form a solution that is then held at temperature for about thirty minutes. The solution is cooled to about 10°C over the course of about two hours and seed crystals of Form A are added when the temperature reaches about 10°C. The temperature is again reduced over a further two hours to -10°C during a thirty minute period thereof an amount of cyclohexane as described above is added dropwise. The temperature is maintained at -10°C for two hours. The final slurry is filtered to afford white crystals of Form B.<br>
In a further alternate procedure, the purified material is taken up in another solvent, preferably toluene, in an amount between about 10 and 20 mL per g., and heated to 75°C to 80°C for 30 minutes and then allowed to cool to 20°C and maintained for 18 hours with stirring. White crystals of Form B are recovered from the slurry by physical separation. The yield and purity of Form B by these procedures is considered very good.<br>
FIGs 1 through 3 are powder x-ray diffraction patterns of Forms A, B and a mixture thereof, respectively, of the subject analog. FIG. 4 is a comparison of powder<br><br>
x-ray diffraction patterns simulated from the single crystal structures for Forms A and B;with the actual pattern for each. X-ray diffraction patterns were generated from a Philips Xpert with a generator source of 44kV and 40 mA and a CuKa filament of X=  1.5406'A at room temperature. In the results shown in FIGs 1-4, as well as in Tables  1 and 2 below which contain the data in summary form, the differences clearly establish that Forms A and B of the subject epothilone analog possess different crystalline structures.   In the Tables, Peak Intensities of from 1 to 12 are classified as very weak, from 13 to 32 as weak, from 33 to 64 as average, from 65 to 87 as strong  and from 88 to 100 as very strong.<br>

FIGs 5 through 7 are the results of Raman spectroscopy of Forms A, B and a mixture thereof, respectively, of the subject analog. The spectra also demonstrate two distinct crystal forms, in particular the bands at 3130 cm-1 and 3115 cm-1.<br>
Distinguishing physical characteristics of the two polymorph forms are shown in Table 3 below. Solution calorimetry was determined using a Thermometries Microcalorimeter in ethanol at 25°C. The solubilities were likewise determined at 25°C.   It is further evident from certain of the data, particularly the heat of solution, that Form A is the more stable and, therefore, Form A is preferred.<br>

Based on the foregoing data, it is concluded that Forms A and B are unique crystalline entities.<br><br>
       The following non-limiting examples serve to illustrate the practice of the<br>
invention.<br>
Example 1 [lS-[lR*,3R*(E),7R*,10S*,llR*,12R*)16S*]]-7,ll-Dihydroxy-8,8,10,12,16-pentamethyl-3-[ 1 -methyl-2-(2-methyl-4-thiazolyl)ethenyl]-4-aza-17-oxabieyclo[14.1.0]heptadecane-5,9-dione.<br>
To a jacketed 125 mL round bottom flask, fitted with a mechanical stirrer, there was combined epothilone-B (5.08 g), tetrabutylammonium azide (BU4NN3) (3.55 g, 1.25 equivalents), ammonium chloride (1.07g, 2 eq), water (1.8 ml, 10 equivalents), tetrahydrofuran (THF) (15 ml), and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (15 ml). The mixture was inerted by sparging nitrogen subsurface for 15 minutes. In a second flask was charged tetrahydrofuran (70 ml), followed by trimethylphosphine (PMea) (1.56 ml, 1.5 equivalents), then tris(dibenzilideneacetone)-dipalladium(0)-chloroform adduct (Pd2(dba)-rCHCl3)(0.259 g, 0.025 equivalents). The catalyst mixture was stirred for 20 minutes at ambient temperature, then added to the epothilone-B mixture. The combined mixture was stirred for 4.5 hours at 30 °C. The completed reaction mixture was then filtered to remove solid ammonium chloride (NH4CI). The filtrate contained (βS, sR, cS, nS, 2R, 3S)-3-[(2S, 3E)-2-amino-3-<br><br>
methyl-4-(2-methyl-4-thiazolyl)-3-butenyl]- -dihydroxy- 2-pentamethyl-<br>
8-oxooxiraneundecanoic acid, tetrabutylammonium salt (1:1) with a HPLC area of 94.1%.<br>
In a 500 mL flask there was combined l-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDCI) (3.82 g, 2 equivalents), l-hydroxy-7-benzotriazole hydrate (HOBt) (1.68 g, 1.1 equivalents), potassium carbonate (1.38 g, • ] equivalent), N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (40 ml) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) (160 ml). The mixture was warmed to 35°C and the filtrate from above was added thereto, dropwise over a period of three hours. This mixture was then stirred for an additional 1 hour at 35 °C. Vacuum distillation was then applied to the reaction mixture to reduce the volume thereof to about 80 mL. The resulting solution was partitioned between 100 mL of ethyl acetate and 100 mL of water. The aqueous layer as then back-extracted with 100 ml ethyl acetate. The combined organic layers were extracted with 50 ml water and then 20 mL brine. The resulting product solution was filtered through a Zeta Plus® pad and then stripped to an oil. The crude oil was dissolved in dichloromethane (20 mL) and washed with water to remove final traces of synthesis solvents and stripped to a solid. The crude solid was chromatographed on silica gel 60 (35 ml silica per gram of theoretical product) with an eluent comprised of 88% dichloromethane (CH2CI2), 10%-30% ethyl acetate (EtOAc) and 2% triethylamine (Et3N). The fractions were analyzed by HPLC, the purest of which were combined and stripped to give the purified solid. The resulting solid, approx. 2 g, was slurried in ethyl acetate (32 ml) for 40 minutes at 75°C, then cyclohexane (C6H12) (16 ml) was slowly added, and the mixture cooled to 5°C. The purified solid was collected on filter paper, washed with cold ethyl acetate/cyclohexane, and dried. The yield was 1.72 g (38% yield) of the white solid product, [1S-[1R*,3R*(E),7R*,10S*,11R*,12R*,16S*]]-7,11-dihydroxy-8,8,10,12,16-pentamethyl-3-[l -methyl-2-(2-methyl-4-thiazolyl)ethenyl]-4-aza-17-oxabicyclo[14.1.0]heptadecane-5,9-dione, with a HPLC area of 99.2%.<br><br>

A 250 mL three-neck flask was charged with 0.61 g of the title compound that<br>
had'been purified (silica gel pad filtration with EtOAc/hexane/Et3N as the eluent,<br>
HPLC area of 96.88) and ethyl acetate (28 mL, 46 ml/1 g). The resultant slurry was<br>
heated to 75°C. All of solids were dissolved after the slurry was stirred at 75°C for<br>
60 minutes. The afforded solution was cooled from 75°C to 50°C over 120 minutes,<br>
seed crystals of Form A being added at 60°C. Crystals appeared at 55°C. The<br>
"temperature was thereafter cooled to 20°C over 120 minutes, while cyclohexane (35<br>
mL, 57 mL/1 g) was added dropwise to the mixture over a period of 60 minutes. The<br>
dbtatined slurry was cooled to -10°C over 120 minutes, and maintained for an<br>
additional 60 minutes.   The slurry was filtered and the afforded white crystals were<br>
dried to give 0.514 g of the title compound, Form A, in 84.3% yield with an HPLC<br>
v<br>
 area of 99.4.<br><br>

mL/1 g) was added dropwise to the mixture over a period of 30 minutes. The<br>
obtained slurry was cooled maintained for an additional 60 minutes.   The slurry was<br>
filtered and the afforded white crystals were dried to give 0.43 g of the title<br>
compound, Form A, in 84.3% yield with an HPLC area of 99.7.<br><br>
Form A - Alternate Procedure<br>
A 500 mL three-neck flask was charged with 18.3 g of a mixture of Forms A<br>
 and B that had been purified (silica gel pad filtration with EtOAc/dichloromethane/Et3N as the eluent, HPLC area of 99) and ethyl acetate (183 mL, 10 ml/1 g). The resultant slurry was heated to 75°C, seed crystals of Form A wereadded and the temperature was maintained for 30 minutes. Cyclohexane (90.2 mL, 5 mL/1 g) was added dropwise to the mixture keeping the temperature at 70°C. After completion of the addition, the temperature was lowered to 20°C and the<br>
  mixture maintained with stirring for a further 18 hours. The temperature was thereafter lowered to 5°C and maintain for 5 hours. The slurry was filtered and the afforded white crystals were dried to give 16.1 g of the title compound, Form A, in<br>
88% yield with an HPLC area of 99.49.<br>
