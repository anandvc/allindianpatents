				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>The present invention is a water treatment plant utilizing the solar energy for obtaining distilled water from saline or dirty water. The embodiment of the plant consists of an airtight bell shaped transparent chamber which is known as an evaporating chamber and it is surrounded by an open cylindrical shell The inside surface of the cylindrical shell is made white to act as a reflecting surface. The bell chamber contains a solar hotplate vviiich is a black coloured metal plate, and with a sprayer fixed above the hot plate. A condensing chamber which is a transparent chamber in oval shape, surmounts tiie evaporating chamber. The condensing chamber is connected by a pipe to a cistern and the cistem is connected by a siphon tube to a tank known as the distilled water collecting tank. A drainpipe fitted at the bottom of the evaporating chamber connects a tank known as the hot water collecting tank. There is a overhead tank filled with the water that has to be distilled. The overhead tank is connected to the water sprayer in the evaporating chamber through solar pre-heaters. Since solar hotplate in the evaporating chamber and the solar pre-heaters are placed exposed to the sunrays, they become hot. The water flowing from the overhead tank into the water sprayer will be hot after passing through the pre-heaters and as this hot water is sprayed on the hot plate, there will be quick evaporation due to the latent heat supplied to the hot water drops by the hot plate. The water vapors rise up from the evaporating chamber and enter the condensing chamber. Due to general expansion in large volume of the condensing chamber, the water vapor condenses on inside surface of the condensing chamber and collects at the bottom of the condensing chamber. This distilled water passes due to gravity through a cistem with a siphon arrangement into a distilled water-collecting tank. Thus distilled water is produced from saline or impure water by utilizing solar energy in this SOLAR WATER TREATMENT PLANT.</td>

BACKGROUND AND BASIS OF THE INVENTION:-<br>
It has long been known that fresh water can be produced from impure or saUne water by many processes such as distillation, freezing, reverse osmosis and etc. Different types of energies as well as expensive equipment have been utilized in producing the distilled water or fresh water. In distillation, water is boiled in boilers to obtain water vapor which is condensed to get distilled water. In some cases seawater is frozen in freezing chambers to form ice. As ice is free from dissolved substances, it forms fresh water on melting. In reveree osmosis, the solvents in the water are not permitted to pass through certain chemical membranes as the water passes through them, thus the water free from solvents, is obtained. There are many designs of plants already in existence utilizing solar energy, for obtaining distilled water. The present SOLAR WATER-TREATMENT PLANT is based on one of the conventional concepts of evaporation of water by the heat derived from the solar energy. This invention substantially departs from the others since it is an innovation of spray drying technique being applied to procure water vapour by latent heat. Thus solar energy is utilized in more efficient manner for evaporation of water to obtain distilled water. This is a plant primarily developed for the purpose of producing distilled water, with such an apparatus to utilize maximum amount of available solar energy by additional systems like solar pre-heaters which make it more efficient and simple in construction, and very much less in operational and maintenance costs.<br>
The plant is environment friendly since no other energy, except solar energy is used in the production of vs^ter free from its dissolved impurities.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION:-<br>
It is therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a new SOLAR WATER-TREATMENT PLANT that utilizes solar energy for producing distilled water out of saline or any other dirty water containing undesirable solvents.<br>

It is a further object of the present invention in general, to provide a new SOLAR WATER-TREATMENT PLANT with a purpose of presenting an environmental friendly device, by avoiding any effluents or pollutants into the atmosphere.<br>
An even further object of the present invention is to provide a new SOLAR WATER-TREATMENT PLANT that is susceptible of low cost of operation and maintenance with regard to both materials and labor, and which accordingly is then susceptible of low price of the derivation to the consuming public, truly making such SOLAR WATER-TREATMENT PLANT economically viable to the public.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a new SOLAR Vi^ATER-TREATMENT PLANT and a method which has many advantages by additional means with novel functions diat resuh in it, which are not anticipated, rendered obvious, suggested or even implied by any of the prior art of desalination plants either alone or in any combination thereof for deriving distilled water and thereby purification of water mentioned heretofore.<br>

Siphon pipe 14, it is a pipe in the shape of an inverted 'U'. Distilled water collecting tank 15, it is also a water-collecting tank . Water tapl6, it is an ordinary tap to close or open to draw water. Vent pipe 17, it is a piece of a short pipe for overflow of water. Solar hot plate 18, it is a metal plate painted black. Drainpipe 19, it is a water pipe to drain water. Hot water collecting tank 20, it is also a water tank. Tap 21, it is like the water tap 16. Vent pipe 22, it is also a short pipe like the vent pipe 17.<br>
CONSTRUCTION AND SET UP: -<br>
The solar hot plate 18 is fixed with its surface to be in the horizontal plane and with the water sprayer 7 above the hot plate. These are enclosed in an airtight evaporating chamber 9. The solar shell 1, from outside, surrounds the evaporating chamber 9. The condensing chamber 11 is mounted over the evaporating chamber 9, with the stem 10 of the evaporating chamber slightly protruding into the bottom of the condensing chamber. This entire embodiment is set up on a platform on the pedestals 2.<br>
The evaporating chamber 9 is connected at its bottom to a tank 20 by a drainpipe 19. The tank 20 is fitted with a tap 21 at its bottom and a vent pipe 22 at its top. The solar pre-heaters of water 3, are placed outside the solar shell 1. One end of the pre-heater 3 is connected to the overhead water tank 4 by the pipe 5 fitted with a faucet 6, and the pipe 5 running through the tank 20. The other end of the pre-heater 3 is connected to sprayer 7 through a regulator 8 and the sprayer 7 is fixed to be vertically above the hot plate 18, inside the chamber 9.<br>
The bottom of the condensing chamber 11 is connected to a cistern 13 by an outlet transparent pipe 12. The cistern 13, is in turn, connected to a tank 15 through a siphon Pipe 14. The tank 15 is fitted with a tap 16 at its bottom and a vent pipel 7, at its top.<br><br>
OPERATION AND WORKING:-<br>
The whole embodiment of evaporation chamber 9 with the solar shell 1 and solar pre-heaters are erected in an open area which is well exposed to the sunrays during whole day. When there is sunUght, the sunrays pass in to the transparent evaporating chamber 9 and fall on the hot plate 18. The inside surface of the solar shell reflects the sunrays on to the hot plate 18 when the sun is not vertically above. Since the plate 18 is made black, it absorbs the heat from the sunrays and becomes hot. The sunrays also heat the solar pre-heaters 3. The overhead tank 4 is filled with the water that has to be distilled and is installed to be far above the level of the pre-heaters 3 and the water sprayer 7. The water from the tank 4 flows into the sprayer 7 through the pre-heaters 3 by gravity when the faucet valve 6 is kept opened.<br>
As the water passes through the hot pre-heaters 3, the water is pre heated before entering the sprayer 7. The flow of water from the sprayer 7, is controlled by the regulator 8 to drip in the form of a spray. Since the hot plate 18 is fixed below the sprayer 7, the pre heated water drips on the hot plate. The hot water dripping on the hot plate 18, quickly evaporates due to the latent heat supplied by the hotplate 18. Thus water vapour is produced in the evaporating chamber 9.<br>
The water vapour naturally rises up from the evaporating chamber 9 and passes through the stem 10 of the evaporating chamber, into tfie condensing chamber 11. As tiie vapour enters the condensing chamber 11, the temperature of the vapour falls because of general expansion due to sudden exposure to the large volume of the chamber 11. As the water vapour cools in the condensing chamber, the vapour condenses on the inner surface of the condensing chamber 11 in the form of droplets. The drops of vrater slide down over the wall and collect at the bottom of the condensing chamber 11.<br><br>
The condensed water collecting at the bottom of condensing chamber 11 tlows down, through the outlet pipe 12 into the cistern 13. When the cistern is full, the water is drawn into tank 15 by siphoning effect of the siphon pipe 14, due gravity. Thus the tank 15 collects the distilled water from the cistem 13 intermittently by siphon- This causes suction that results low pressure in the condensing chamber 11 and this effect enhances the condensation in the chamber. The distilled water collected in the tank 15 is drawn out through its tapl6.<br>
The water which is not evaporated but still in hot condition, collects at the bottom of the evaporating chamber 9. The hot w^ter passes out of this chamber through its drainpipe 19 into the tank 20, by gravity. So the tank 20 collects the hot vrater containing the dissolved impurities. As the inlet pipe 5 is also running through the hot water of the tank 20, the water in the pipe is pre heated utilizing the heat in the exhaust water, before entering the pre-heaters. The hot water from the tank 20, is taken out through its tap 21.<br>
As described above, the distilled water that is free from the dissolved impurities, is obtained by means of this plant utilizing the solar energy.<br>
In view thereof it should be understood that the particular embodiments of the invention shown in the drawing and described above, are intended to be illustrative only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention in design and shape without departing from such principles described herein.<br><br><br><br><br>
