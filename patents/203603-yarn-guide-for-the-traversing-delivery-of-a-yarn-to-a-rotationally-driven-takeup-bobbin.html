				<td>YARN GUIDE FOR THE TRAVERSING DELIVERY OF A YARN TO A ROTATIONALLY DRIVEN TAKEUP BOBBIN<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This application claims the benefit of German Application DE 19858548.9, filed December 18,1998, herein incorporated by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a yam guide and, more particularly, to a yam guide for the traversing delivery of a yam to a rotationally driven takeup bobbin for creating a cross-wound bobbin, or cheese, in a bobbin winder of a textile machine as generically defined by the characteristics of the preamble to the first claim.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION To make textile bobbins, it is necessary in principle on the one hand to make the bobbin rotate and on the other to traverse the traveling yam, which is being wound onto the rotating bobbin, along the bobbin axis. If the yam is traversed very slowly, a bobbin with highly parallel windings is created. If such a bobbin is meant to have a relatively large volume and to have flat face ends disposed substantially at right angles to the bobbin axis, then boundary disks are required on both ends of the package. These boundary disks are not necessary if the yam is traversed fast enough to produce a cross winding. High winding speeds thus require a very high traversing rate as well.<br>
Drive means such as belts, oriented parallel to the bobbin axis, can be used for this purpose. European Patent Disclosure EP 0 311 827 A2 describes one such yam guide in which the belt is driven by means of a microprocessor-controlled stepper motor. High traversing speeds can be attained and the yam guide can be controlled relatively precisely.<br>
I A<br><br>
So-called shogging rollers are also very widely used to create the traversing motions; in high-speed bobbin winders, they often simultaneously utilized to provide the circumferential drive for the cheese. However, the laying angle dictated is always the same, regardless of the bobbin fullness, and at certain rpm ratios between the bobbin and the drive roller, so-called ribbon windings occur, which later present considerable unwinding problems. The prior art therefore describes many so-called ribbon breaking methods.<br>
To create a predetermined winding pattern, such as a precision or graduated precision winding, the bobbin must be driven separately irom the yam guide. This can be done, among other ways, by spacing the aforementioned shogging roller apart from the takeup bobbin, which is driven separately. As a rule, a yam guide then slides in the shogging groove. This system has disadvantages because of inertia.<br>
So-called finger yam guides have also long been known (for instance from published, examined German Patent Application DEAS1131575 and published, unexamined German Patent Application DE OS 15 60 360), in which a finger- or forklike yam guide is pivotable about an axis disposed substantially perpendicular to the takeup bobbin axis. Instead of the conventional mechanical drive mechanisms described therein, electromechanical drive mechanisms have meanwhile been proposed for these fork-like yam guides of the kind suggested for instance in European Patent Application EP 0 808 791 A2 or in European Application EP 0 838 442 Al, which representatively describe this basic type of drive. However, these references merely mention that these drive means are electric motors. It can be assumed that either the rotary motion of the motor is converted into a pivoting motion of the yam guide finger, via gear means that increase the inertia of regulation, or else a motor is used that drives<br>
2<br><br>
the yam guide finger directly, and in the case of a stepper motor generates the desired pivoting angle via a predeterminable number of steps. Given the high speed and the high direction-reversal frequency, stepping errors can occur, which then lead to a permanent shifting of the drive mechanism and consequently to winding flaws.<br>
In conventional electric motors, such as electronically commutated motors, it is also difficult on the one hand to generate a required high moment at the turning points but on the other to keep the mass of the rotor, which executes only a pivoting motion, small enough that the resultant mass inertia does not further increase the required moment.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is accordingly an object of the invention to improve the aforementioned electromechanical type of drive for a traversing yam guide in a bobbin winder.<br>
This object is attained according to the invention by a yam guide for imparting a traversing motion to a yam in a textile yam winding operation. In such an operation, the yam is being delivered to a rotationally driven takeup bobbin. .The traversing motion creates a cross-wound bobbin, or cheese. According to the present invention, the yam guide comprises a fork-like guide element, pivoting means for pivoting about a pivot axis oriented substantially perpendicular to the axis of the takeup bobbin, and an electromagnetic mechanism. The electromagnetic mechanism comprises an air gap, a plurality of magnets disposed along the air gap, a plurality of yokes and at least one electrical coil extending into the air gap. The magnets are disposed along the air gap and generate magnetic field lines which extend in a substantially perpendicular direction through the air gap. Current may be supplied to the electrical coil, which is movable along the air gap.<br>
3<br><br>
The invention achieves a number of advantages. According to the invention, a relatively high magnetic flux density can be achieved inside the air gap, and the losses, given a small air gap width and adequate dimensioning of the yokes, which have a low magnetic resistance, are low. By supplying current to the coil, which is located in the region of the magnetic field lines, the moment required to deflect the yam guide is attained.<br>
The dimensioning of the coil is closely related to the adaptation to the gap width of the air gap according to the invention, through which the magnet lines flow. The spacing of the windings of the coil that extend into the air gap from the pivot axis of the yam guide detemiines the magnitude of the moment that can be attained by the drive mechanism. This moment is great in proportion to the mass inertia of the coil. The other parts of the body involved in the oscillation can be made from very lightweight material and need merely have the stability required for the incident forces, so that low mass inertia is obtained.<br>
The air gap, and thus all the elements for generating the magnetic field, need merely extend over the pivoting range of the electrical coil, which corresponds to the maximum settable traversing stroke of the yam guide. The engineering expense is thus limited accordingly. Similarly, only one electrical coil is needed, which during the oscillation moves up and down along the suitably dimensioned slip. As previously noted, it is of particular importance that the elements involved in the pivoting motion have the least possible mass, since at the region at the center of the oscillation of the yam guide, considerable angular accelerations must be achieved and accordingly, given high mass inertia of the oscillating parts, very high moments must be imposed. It must<br>
4<br><br>
be taken into account here that in the manufacture of cheeses or bobbin winders, yam guide oscillation frequencies may range up to 30 Hz.<br>
To generate the magnetic field, it is enough for magnets to be disposed on one side of the air gap. A yoke is then disposed directly on the opposite side of the air gap from the back side of the magnet assembly. The magnetic field lines thus for the most part extend within good magnetic conductors. The air gap can be made small, as already described above, so that the magnetic resistance is fiirther limited.<br>
However, according to another aspect of the invention, it is also possible to dispose magnets on both sides of the air gap, as a result of which the magnetic flux density can be fiirther increased and greater moments can be attained.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, the magnets can either be permanent magnets, which need not be connected to a power supply, or electromagnets, with which a higher magnetic flux density, and thus even greater capacity, are attainable.<br>
In yet another aspect of the invention, the magnets may be disposed in a first magnet region and a second magnet region, with the boundary between the regions being generally located adjacent the center of the electrical coil pivoting range. In the first magnet region, the polarities of the magnets are arranged such that their magnetic flux occurs in a first direction, and in the second magnet region, the polarities of the magnets are arranged such that their magnetic flux occurs in a second direction, the second direction being generally opposite the first direction. Thus, it is assured that the same moment with the same orientation is brought to bear on the two winding legs of the electrical coil. This is obtained from the opposed current flow direction and the opposed magnetic flux directions. It must be noted that although the moments must have the same direction if the system is to be operated at high efficiency, it is<br>
5<br><br>
nevertheless not compulsory for the magnitude of the moments to be identical in both winding legs. A different magnitude could for instance occur if the magnetic fields are of various intensities, or if the courses of the winding legs inside their respective associated magnetic fields differ from one another.<br>
Unlike an electronically commutated motor, in which commutation is necessary during the direction of action, which remains constant, of the drive moment, in the present invention a change of current direction leads directly to the reversal of the algebraic sign of the drive moment. This in turn simplifies the triggering of the direct drive of the oscillating yam guide.<br>
According to another feature of the invention, the windings of the electrical coil that are required to generate the moment and that extend into the air gap are disposed entirely at a relatively great spacing from the pivot point of the yam guide, so that the leverage which is created may be utilized to generate a relatively high moment.<br>
By comparison, in another feature of the invention, some of the moment-generating winding legs of the electrical coil are disposed relatively close to the pivot point of the yam guide. In this connection it should be pointed out that the distance from the pivot point should be suitably limited, because as the distance from the pivot point increases, the coil also increasingly generates a moment of inertia that counteracts the drive. In this example, however, a majority of the electrical coil are not involved in the moment generation and are located radially farther outward than those winding legs that are involved in the moment generation. Nevertheless, because of its great spacing from the pivot point of the yam guide, this passive part of the coil with respect to the drive moment contributes to a higher moment of inertia of the yam guide.<br>
6<br><br>
Overall, however, this aspect of the invention also utilizes a drive device that can be open- or closed-loop controlled very easily, is simple in structure, and has high efficiency.<br>
The magnitude and direction of the moment is set by open- or closed-loop control of the current in every phase of the motion.   This can be done via a control device in the form of a microprocessor, which controls the current intensity and current direction in accordance with a predeterminable program as a function of angle and time, in such a way that over the traversing width, the desired lay angle of the yam at the time is obtained, or the traversing width or the traversing end points can be adjusted. By suitable sensor means, the applicable angle is detected, the adherence to the set-point value is checked, and if necessary, the actual value is adapted to the set- point value again by closed-loop control, also known as regulation.  Known PID controllers can be used for this purpose, while the instantaneous angle may be determined utilizing, for example, a known infrared light gate, which scans markings that are arranged concentrically to the axis of oscillation.<br>
As already noted above, the moment to be brought to bear over the substantially predominant portion of the stroke distance is very small, while because of the very high angular accelerations at the direction-reversal locations of the yam guide, very high moments have to be generated at these locations. In order for a known end stage to generate the correspondingly high voltage values for the abruptly more-intensive supply of current to the electrical coil, this end stage must be operated with a high operating voltage. It also proves difficult to generate a sudden voltage change, of the kind necessary here, within a known end stage. In the usual digital triggering of an end stage via pulse width modulation, extremely short pulse widths must alternate with extremely<br>
7<br><br>
long pulse widths because of the required voltage peaks. These extremely short pulse widths present greater demands on the control technology. Furthermore, given what is a markedly excessive voltage for the substantially predominant portion of the operating period, the pulse width modulation required to establish the requisite low voltage would lead to a considerable power loss.<br>
To overcome these disadvantages, another aspect of the invention provides that a second supply voltage source may be utilized, at which an operating voltage is available which is a multiple of that at the first supply voltage source. This second supply voltage source is connected to the electrical coil at the direction-reversal locations of the yam guide, so that the requisite instantaneously-needed high moment is available there, without having to expect an overall high power loss.<br>
By the use of a suitably dimensioned capacitor, the necessary voltage can be instantaneously furnished at the second supply voltage source. This capacitor also assures that the voltage will not break down prematurely.<br>
According to yet another aspect of the present invention, it is especially advantageous if the capacitor is charged by means of a charge pump between each two clearing actions of the capacitor. As a function of the frequency of the oscillating system, the charge pump can be adjusted such that the requisite charge duration is equivalent to the time between two successive clearing actions. This makes continuous operation of the charge pump possible.<br>
The higher angular acceleration attainable shortens the dwell time of the yam guide and thus also of the yam in the region of the endpoints of the traversing width. This in turn makes the density of the cheese more uniform, because the dwell time of<br>
8<br><br>
the yam in the peripheral zones is approximately equal to the dwell time in the remainder of the cheese.<br>
In a still further aspect of the present invention, a very high voltage, and thus a very high moment, can be brought to bear on the electrical coil, without causing saturation phenomena inherent in a conventional electric motor. Because of the instantly available high voltage provided by the second supply voltage source or through capacitor discharge, the current forced through the electrical coil rises markedly faster, and so the proportional torque can rise correspondingly quickly as well.<br>
To further aid in reversing the direction of motion, in yet another aspect of the present invention, it is also possible to use mechanical energy storing means at the direction-reversal locations, in a manner known per se. This lessens the maximum moment required at these locations. However, the yam guide, which as noted should be as lightweight as possible in order to minimize the moment of inertia, must then be designed to be markedly more stable, and thus, heavier. Also, the yam guide becomes louder and has a shorter service life. Last but not least, the control quality of the controller suffers from abmpt changes in moment as the yam guide enters the energy storing means.<br>
In another feature of the present invention, the use of an energy storing means, which with the yam guide forms a substantially harmonically oscillating mechanical system, leads to a relief of the drive mechanism, or in other words, a reduction in the energy to be supplied to the drive mechanism, and does not have the described disadvantages of the springs disposed only in the peripheral region. The energy storing means reduces the area under the graph of the square of the drive moment to only one-<br>
9<br><br>
third of the value that would be required without such an energy storing means. This means above all that even under heavy loads the drive mechanism does not become overheated. It must be remembered that the problem was not solvable by more generous dimensioning of the drive mechanism in many cases, because the coil mass increases the mass inertia of the oscillating parts and thus in turn increases the necessary moment for generating oscillation.<br>
The energy storing means may comprise a spring, and in particular, a torsion spring. In the deflection range of approximately 30° to the left and right, which is the range of interest here, a spiral spring, especially of band-like material, can advantageously be used, because in this range it can be assumed that the spring's characteristic curve will ascend identically for deflection in either direction.<br>
Instead of one spiral spring, it is also possible to use two spiral springs, and as a result the desired course of the resultant spring characteristic curve can be even better controlled. In addition, the spiral springs, disposed for instance on both sides of the oscillating part, can also be used for supplying current to the electrical coil.<br>
To assure that in both directions of oscillation the same course of spring force will be achieved, the spiral springs should have opposed winding directions. This requirement becomes significant, however, only when the angle of deflection from the position of repose of the yam guide exceeds a limit value, since the course of the spring characteristic curve then differs when the spring is being opened and when it is being closed.<br>
This can also be the case, however, even at a lower oscillation amplitude, if in the direction-reversal region a progressive course of the spring characteristic curves<br>
1o<br><br>
already ensues. The selection of the spring accordingly reinforces the drive mechanism in the region in which the greatest moment is required.<br>
The invention will be described in further detail below in terms of exemplary embodiments in conjunction with the drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
11<br><br>
In the front view of a yam guide having an electromechanical drive mechanism shown in Fig. 1, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, a cross-wound bobbin or cheese 1 can be seen, which rests on a support roller 3. The cheese 1 is supported by its bobbin tube 2 in a bobbin creel (not shown). The drive of the cheese can be effected via one of the tube plates of the creel, which clamp the bobbin tube 2 between them. Alternatively, instead of the support roller 3, a drive roller can be provided, by which, unlike the aforementioned direct drive of the cheese 1, a peripheral surface friction drive is effected.<br>
The yam 5 delivered to the cheese 1 is guided inside a fork-like guide element 6' of the yam guide 6. A traversing ruler 4 assures the rectilinear guidance of the yam, which is required so that the yam will always be guided at a constant and as short as possible spacing from the clamping line between the support roller 3 and the cheese 1. This is necessary in order to attain a satisfactory winding structure of the cheese I.<br>
Instead of the rectilinear guidance provided by the traversing ruler 4, it would also be conceivable to drive a body, which contains a yam guide eyelet and displaceably supported along the position of the traversing ruler 4, with a lever that corresponds to the yam guide 6. However, then it must be remembered that additional forces of inertia and friction must be overcome, which at high traversing frequencies adversely affect the entire system.<br>
The yam guide 6 is secured via a mount 6" to a shaft 7. As seen in Fig. 2, this shaft 7 is in turn supported in roller bearings 12 and 13, which are disposed in side walls 9 and 10 of a housing 8. In order to limit further rotation, caused by inertia, of the roller bodies when the direction of motion of the yam guide 6 is reversed, the roller<br>
12<br><br>
bearing can be tensed more strongly than usual.   Alternatively, however, it is also conceivable to use different bearings, such as, for example, magnet-based bearings.<br>
A rocker-like coil carrier 14 is also secured to the shaft 7. Lateral tongue-like outriggers 14' and 14" of this coil carrier are connected, in a manner fixed against relative rotation, to an inward-protruding tongue of spiral springs 20 and 21, which are made of metal band material. The two spiral springs 20 and 21 are wound in opposite directions of rotation. A coil 15 is wound onto the coil carrier 14 in a manner such that its center axis intersects the pivot axis of the yam guide 6, whereby the windings of the coil extend about the coil carrier 14 in four rectilinear extents, referred to herein as legs, 15', 15", 15'" and 15"", angularly oriented to each other.<br>
Mounts 20' and 21' of the torsion springs 20 and 21 are secured to the side walls 9 and 10 of the housing 8. The two torsion springs 20 and 21 are firmly fastened in these mounts 20' and 21'.<br>
As represented by double arrows in Fig. 2, the mounts can be adjusted in their position relative to the side walls 9 and 10 by being shifted in oblong slots 41 and 41'. This adjustability is required, for at least one of the two mounts, so that it can be assured that the yam guide 6 in a resting condition will assume a centered position within the range of its oscillation amplitude. Adjusting both torsion springs makes it possible for this center position to be the zero point of both spring characteristic curves simultaneously.<br>
Current may be supplied to the coil 15 via lead lines 38 and 38' to the mounts 20' and 21', then via the torsion springs 20 and 21 to their fastening points to the shaft 7, and from there to the coil 15 via lead lines 37 and 37'. In this way, it is assured that the respective fixed lead lines will not be exposed to any relative motion. The relative<br>
13<br><br>
motion is absorbed by the spiral springs 20 and 21. It is understood, however, that still other lead lines are conceivable that have high flexibility. In order then to limit the motion, these lead lines should be located as close as possible to the axis 7.<br>
An inner yoke 16 of ferromagnetic material has the shape of an annular segment, as seen in Fig. 1, and has a rectangular cross section, as seen in Fig. 2. Opposite the outer circumference of the annular-segmental inner yoke 16, a magnet assembly 18, 18' is secured to a similarly annular- segmental outer yoke 16'. Between the outer circumference of the inner yoke 16 and the magnet assembly 18, 18', an au" gap 17 is formed, which has a constant gap vwdth over its length. However, such a constant gap width is not compulsory. For instance, the air gap 17 could be wider in the middle of the left and right halves of the air gap 17 and could thereby attenuate the magnet field, since the active extents, or legs, 15' and 15" of the coil windings 15, are located thereat when the yam guide 6 assumes its center position, in which only slight drive moment, or none at all, is needed.<br>
The magnets are polarized differently on the left and right sides, of the center point of the pivoting range of the coil 15. The result is that in a first region of the magnets 18 magnetic field lines 19 are formed which are essentially aimed at the pivot point of the yam guide, while in a second region of the magnets 18', magnetic field lines 19' that point away from the yam guide are formed.<br>
The field lines extending through the yokes 16 and 16' are not shown for the sake of simplicity. However, in both yokes 16 and 16' they form bridges and all the magnetic field lines extend through the center of the U-shaped yokes. It is therefore also possible to embody the yokes with a markedly reduced cross section in the peripheral region compared to the center.<br>
14<br><br>
During the entire pivoting motion of the yam guide 6, one of the two winding legs, either 15' or 15", of the electrical coil 15 extends within a respective one of the two portions of the air gap 17, the portions differing in terms of the direction of the magnetic field lines. Because of the winding plane of the coil 15, there are necessarily different resultant directions of electrical current in the two winding legs 15' and 15", and thus the moment exerted on the winding legs 15' and 15" by the magnetic field, represented by the magnetic field lines 19 and 19', has the same algebraic sign. The arc spacing of the two winding legs 15' and 15" from one another is greater than the distance covered along the air gap 17 at a maximum pivoting angle of the yam guide 6. As a result, each winding leg 15' and 15" travels only within an air gap region in which the magnetic field lines 19 and 19' extend in a uniform direction. As a result, over the entire pivoting distance, the current and moment are proportional, in particular with respect to their algebraic sign. The expense for open- or closed loop control can thus be kept low.<br>
The housing 8 is provided with a lid 11, which includes a slit within which the yam guide 6 is movable. Instead of mounting the yam guide 6 centrally on the shaft 7, it is also possible to fix this yam guide on the shaft 7 outside the housing 8, in which case the housing 8 can be fully encapsulated.<br>
On the shaft 7, in the region of the yam guide mount 6", there is a disk 39, which has markings concentric to the center axis of the shaft 7. These markings are scanned with two infi-ared light gates 40, 40'. By disposing the two infrared light gates 40, 40' offset with respect to the pitch of the markings, it is possible to ascertain the direction of motion of the disk at a given time. The angular adjustment of the yam guide 6 at that time can thus be ascertained by counting the increments.   To further<br>
15<br><br>
increase the number of increments over the pivoting path, it is possible to provide additional  infrared  light  gates,  which  correspondingly  increases  the  number of increments for the same pivoting angle.   However, in order to have sufficiently high resolution for the controller even near the direction-reversal locations of the yam guide, it is recommended than an observer be used as described, for example, in German Patent Disclosure DE 19 73 5581 Al. The increments measured by the infrared sensor 40 are sent to a microprocessor (not shown) in which a set-point course of the oscillation of the yam guide is stored in memory and a closed-loop controller, which outputs as its controlled variable the current eye that flows through the coil 15, is connected. Thus, the desired drive moment can be generated over the entire course of oscillation.   To refine the closed-loop control and for the sake of constant control quality, the controller can be embodied as a PID controller or as a status controller, which is furthermore adaptively embodied; that is, it adapts itself constantly to currently prevailing conditions (such as a varying yam tension, bearing friction, etc.). Predictive closed-loop control, that is, taking a previously known course into account, can also be performed.   By means of other known closed-loop control principles, an ever greater refinement in the control quality can be achieved.<br>
The set-point course of the yam laying can be adjusted by means of various parameters that promote the buildup of windings on the cheese. By providing a varying amplitude, for instance, a stroke expansion of the yam guide and thus a lessening of the edge hardness or edge curvature of the cheese can be attained. A wide variety of winding stmctures, such as precision or graduated precision windings, can also be achieved without mechanical adjustment work. The adjustment of the desired width of the cheese also involves only minimal effort.<br>
16<br><br>
The spiral springs 20 and 21 can be selected such that the characteristic curves<br>
extend, not in a straight line to the direction-reversal locations, but progressively, so<br>
I<br>
that to attain the same oscillation, the electromechanical drive mechanism is relieved. In that case the oscillation is only approximately harmonic, but this is no problem since the course of oscillation remains imiform.<br>
In a variant of the invention, shown in Figs. 3 and 4, magnets 18, 18' and 22,22' are disposed on both sides of the air gap 17. This further increases the magnetic flux density in the air gap 17, and thus a higher moment on the yam guide is also possible, for the same electrical power and for the same dimensioning of the coil 15. It is understood that respective magnets 18, 22 and 18', 22' face one another with different polarity to the left and right of the air gap 17.<br>
In a further variant of the invention, shown only in a front view in Fig. 5, the permanent magnets 18 and 18' of the first variant are replaced by electromagnets, which are formed by coils 24, 24' that have cores 25, 25'. The power supply to these coils is not shown separately here. The coils are insulated from the side walls 9 and 10, or these side walls are made of nonconductive material, such as plastic.<br>
By means of the electromagnets formed, magnetic field lines with the orientations corresponding to the previous examples are embodied. However, an even stronger magnetic field can be attained, which can also be adjusted differently, for example as a function of the load on the arm guide 6.<br>
In Figs. 6 and 7, a variant that differs more markedly from the previous exemplary embodiments is shown. The air gap here is rotated 90° relative to the variants already described; or in other words, the air gap is located in a plane that intersects the pivot axis of the yam guide 26. Magnets 31 and 31' are embodied in the<br>
17<br><br>
shape of a circular segment and are secured, for example, by screw connections 30, 30' and 30", to a magnet carrier 36 that at the same time is embodied as a side wall serving as a yoke. Accordingly, yokes 35 and 36 (Fig. 7) are present on both sides of the arrangement of magnets 31 and 31', and these yokes are intended to conduct the magnetic flux as much as possible without significant losses.<br>
An electrical coil 28 is also disposed on the yam guide 26; similarly to the magnets 31 and 31', this coil has the shape of a circular segment as much as possible. Lead lines 42 and 42' are extended centrally through a shaft 29, on which the yam guide 26 is secured, to the outside of the yam guide 26. Bores 29 and 29" are made in this shaft 29 for this purpose. Because of the close placement to the pivot point, an external power supply (not shown) is deflected only slightly by the oscillation of the yam guide 26, so that no overly great demands are made of its flexibility.<br>
Compression springs 34' and 34" reinforce the reversal of the direction of motion of the yam guide 26 in the region of the direction-reversal locations. These compression springs 34' and 34" are mechanically adjustable to vary the stroke.<br>
In this last laying system shovm, it is understood that it is also possible, to use spiral springs instead of the compression springs 34' and 34", as in the preceding examples, and these springs then have the aforementioned examples.<br>
The closed-loop control of the drive is effected analogously to the preceding examples. An angle encoder in the form of an incremental counter (not shovwi) can also correspond to the preceding examples.<br>
In Fig. 8, an end stage 44 is shown, in simplified form, which can be used for supplying voltage to the coil 15 or 28.<br>
18<br><br>
While a supply voltage source is indicated at 45, switches 46 through 48, embodied for instance by field effect transistors, are provided for controlling the current supply to the coil 15, 28. These switches 46 through 48 are triggered by the control device 43, as schematically represented by airows. The switches 46 and 48, and the switches 47 and 49, are always switched in the same way. By varying the respective ON time, the operating voltage specified by the supply voltage source 45 is modulated as needed. This modulation includes both the amount and the sign of the voltage applied, so that the moment required at every point in the oscillating motion of the yam guide can be generated.<br>
The end stage 44' shown in Fig. 9 is supplemented with a second supply voltage source 52, which can likewise be connected to the coil 15, 28 via switches 56 and 57. These switches 56 and 57, also embodied as field effect transistors, are also triggered by the control device 43 which is preferably a microprocessor as already noted. They are actuated in alternation at the turning points of the yam guide 6, 26.<br>
The second supply voltage source 52 furnishes a multiple of that furnished by the first supply voltage source 45. Thus, either a higher operating voltage is present from the very beginning at the input 55, or it is generated by means of a charge pump 54 in the capacitor 53. The charge pump 54 is advantageously adjusted such that it provides the required charge for the capacitor 53 in each case up until the next switching event of one of the two switches 56 or 57. To that end, the charge pump 54<br>
can likewise be adjusted by the control device 43 as a function of the yam guide<br>
I<br>
frequency.<br>
By means of the modified end stage 44', which has a second supply voltage<br>
I<br>
source 52, it is possible to make a higher voltage available abmptly at the direction-<br>
19<br><br>
reversal locations of the yam guide, the effect of which is a faster increase in the current flow and thus in the moment generated. Since this second supply voltage source 52 is turned on only very briefly at any given time, it is possible to use the supply voltage source 45 exclusively over virtually the entire range of the yam guide 6, 26, which makes for substantially higher efficiency.<br>
When the second voltage source 52 is switched on via the switches 47 and 48, corresponding diodes 50 and 51 are placed between them to prevent a strong current from flowing out to the first supply voltage source 35 and causing damage to this supply voltage source.<br>
It will therefore be readily imderstood by those persons skilled in the art that the present invention is susceptible of broad utility and application. Many embodiments and adaptations of the present invention other than those herein described, as well as many variations, modifications and equivalent arrangements, will be apparent from or reasonably suggested by the present invention and the foregoing description thereof, without departing from the substance or scope of the present invention.
