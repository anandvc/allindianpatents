				<td>This patent application claims the benefit of United States Provisional Patent<br>
Application No. 60/65249 filed February 11,2005.<br>
This invention relates to compounds that are antagonists of the action of glucagon<br>
on the glucagon receptor, or inverse agonists of the glucagon receptor, and to<br>
pharmaceutical compositions thereof, and to the uses of these compounds and<br>
compositions in the treatment of the human or animal body. The invention also relates to<br>
intermediates and methods of making the glucagon antagonists, inverse agonists, and<br>
pharmaceutical compositions thereof. The present compounds show a high affinity and<br>
selective binding for the glucagon receptor, and as such are useful in the treatment of<br>
disorders responsive to the modulation of glucagon receptors, such as diabetic and other<br>
glucagon related metabolic disorders, and the like.<br>
Glucagon is a key hormonal agent that, in cooperation with insulin, mediates<br>
homeostatic regulation of blood glucose. Glucagon primarily acts by stimulating certain<br>
cells (important among these are liver cells) to release glucose when blood glucose levels<br>
fall. The action of glucagon is opposite to that of insulin, which stimulates cells to take<br>
up and store glucose whenever blood glucose levels rise. Both glucagon and insulin are<br>
peptide hormones. Native glucagon is a 29 amino acid peptide and is produced in the<br>
alpha islet cells of the pancreas and insulin is produced in the beta islet cells. Glucagon<br>
exerts its action by binding to and activating its receptor, which is a member of the<br>
Glucagon-Secretin branch of the 7-transmembrane G-protein coupled receptor family.<br>
The receptor functions by activating the adenylyl cyclase second messenger system<br>
resulting in an increase in cAMP levels. The glucagon receptor, or naturally occurring<br>
variants of the receptor, may possess intrinsic constitutive activity, in vitro as well as<br>
in vivo (i.e. activity in the absence of an agonist). Compounds acting as inverse agonists<br>
can inhibit this activity.<br>
Diabetes mellitus is a common disorder of glucose metabolism. The disease is<br>
characterized by hyperglycemia and may be classified as type 1 diabetes, the insulin-<br>
dependent form, or type 2 diabetes, which is non-insulin-dependent in character. Subjects<br>
with type 1 diabetes are hyperglycemic and hypoinsulinemic, and the conventional<br>
treatment for this form of the disease is to provide insulin. However, in some patients<br>
with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, absolute or relative elevated glucagon levels have been<br>
shown to contribute to the hyperglycemic state. Both in healthy control animals as well as<br>
in animal models of type 1 and type 2 diabetes, removal of circulating glucagon with<br>
selective and specific antibodies has resulted in reduction of the glycemic level. Mice<br>
with a homozygous deletion of the glucagon receptor exhibit increased glucose tolerance.<br>
Also, inhibition of glucagon receptor expression using antisense oligonucleotides<br>
ameliorates diabetic syndrome in db/db mice. These studies suggest that glucagon<br>
suppression or an action that antagonizes glucagon could be a useful adjunct to<br>
conventional treatment of hyperglycemia in diabetic patients. The action of glucagon can<br>
be suppressed by providing an antagonist or an inverse agonist, i.e. substances that<br>
prevent or inhibit constituitive, or glucagon-induced, glucagon receptor mediated<br>
responses.<br>
Several publications disclose peptides that are stated to act as glucagon<br>
antagonists. Probably, the most thoroughly characterized antagonist is DesHis'fGlu9]-<br>
glucagon amide (Unson et al., Peptides 10,1171 (1989); Post et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.<br>
USA 90,1662 (1993)). Other antagonists are DesHis1, Phe6[Glu9]-glucagon amide<br>
(Azizh et al., Bioorganic &amp; Medicinal Chem. Lett. 16,1849 (1995)) and NLeu9,Ala11,16-<br>
glucagon amide (Unson et al., J. Biol. Chem. 269 (17), 12548 (1994)). Peptide<br>
antagonists of peptide hormones are often potent, however they are generally known not<br>
to be orally available because of degradation by physiological enzymes, and poor<br>
distribution in vivo. Therefore, orally available non-peptide antagonists of peptide<br>
hormones are generally preferred.<br>
A number of publications have appeared in recent years reporting non-peptide<br>
agents that act at the glucagon receptor. In spite of the number of treatments for diseases<br>
that involve glucagon, the current therapies suffer from one or more inadequacies,<br>
including poor or incomplete efficacy, unacceptable side effects, and contraindications for<br>
certain patient populations. Thus there remains a need for improved treatments using<br>
alternative or improved pharmaceutical agents mat modulate glucagon receptor activity<br>
and treat the diseases that could benefit from glucagon receptor modulation. The present<br>
invention provides such a contribution to the art based on the finding that a novel class of<br>
compounds has a high affinity, selective, and potent inhibitory activity at the glucagon<br>
receptor. The present invention is distinct in the particular structures and their activities.<br>

the same or different.<br>
The term "patient" includes human and non-human animals, such as companion<br>
animals (dogs and cats and the like) and livestock animals. Livestock animals are .<br>
animals raised for food production. Ruminants or "cud-chewing" animals such as cows,<br>

example "glucagon receptor mediated cellular responses" include but are not limited to<br>
release of glucose from liver, or other cells, in response to glucagon stimulation or<br>
glucagon receptor activity. One of ordinary skill in the art can readily identify other<br>
cellular responses mediated by glucagon receptor activity, for example by observing a<br>
change in the responsive cellular endpoint after contacting the cell with an effective dose<br>
of glucagon.<br>
The terms "treatment", "treating" and "treat", as used herein, include their<br>
generally accepted meanings, i.e., the management and care of a patient for the purpose of<br>
preventing, prohibiting, restraining, alleviating, ameliorating, slowing, stopping, delaying,<br>
or reversing the progression or severity of a disease, disorder, or pathological condition,<br>
described herein, including the alleviation or relief of symptoms or complications, or the<br>

"Composition" means a pharmaceutical composition and is intended to encompass<br>
a pharmaceutical product comprising the active ingredient(s) including compound(s) of<br>
Formulae I-IV and the inert ingredients) that make up the carrier. Accordingly, the<br>
pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention encompass any composition made<br>
by admixing a compound of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carrier.<br>
The term "suitable solvent" refers to any solvent, or mixture of solvents, inert to<br>
the ongoing reaction that sufficiently solubilizes the reactants to afford a medium within<br>
which to effect the desired reaction.<br>
The term "unit dosage form" means physically discrete units suitable as unitary<br>
dosages for human subjects and other non-human animals, each unit containing a<br>
predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic<br>

Certain of the above defined terms may occur more than once in the structural<br>
formulae, and upon such occurrence each term shall be defined independently of the<br>
other.<br>
As used herein, the term "stereoisomer" refers to a compound made up of the<br>
same atoms bonded by the same bonds but having different three-dimensional structures<br>
which are not interchangeable. The three-dimensional structures are called<br>
configurations. As used herein, the term "enantiomer" refers to two stereoisomers whose<br>
molecules are nonsuperimposable mirror images of one another. The term "chiral center"<br>
refers to a carbon atom to which four different groups are attached. As used herein, the<br>
term "diastereomers" refers to stereoisomers which are not enantiomers. In addition, two<br>
diastereomers which have a different configuration at only one chiral center are referred<br>
to herein as "epimers." The terms "racemate," "racemic mixture" or "racemic<br>
modification" refer to a mixture of equal parts of enantiomers.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be chiral, and it is intended that any<br>
enantiomers, as separated, pure or partially purified enantiomers or racemic mixtures<br>
mereof are included within the scope of the invention. Furthermore, when a double bond<br>
or a fully or partially saturated ring system or more than one center of asymmetry or a<br>
bond with restricted rotatability is present in the molecule diastereomers may be formed.<br>
It is intended that any diastereomers, as separated, pure or partially purified diastereomers<br>
or mixtures thereof are included within the scope of the invention. Furthermore, some of<br>
the compounds of the present invention may exist in different tautomeric forms and it is<br>
intended that any tautomeric forms, which the compounds are able to form, are included<br>
within the scope of the present invention. Thus, as one skilled in the art knows, certain<br>
aryls may exist in tautomeric forms. The invention also includes tautomers, enantiomers<br>
and other stereoisomers of the compounds of Formulae I-IV. Such variations are<br>
contemplated to be within the scope of the invention.<br>
The terms "R" and "S" are used herein as commonly used in organic chemistry to<br>
denote specific configuration of a chiral center. The term "R" (rectus) refers to that<br>
configuration of a chiral center with a clockwise relationship of group priorities (highest<br>
to second lowest) when viewed along the bond toward the lowest priority group. The<br>
term "S" (sinister) refers to that configuration of a chiral center with a counterclockwise<br>
relationship of group priorities (highest to second lowest) when viewed along the bond<br>
toward the lowest priority group. The priority of groups is based upon their atomic<br>
number (in order of decreasing atomic number). A partial list of priorities and a<br>
discussion of stereochemistry is contained in "Nomenclature of Organic Compounds:<br>
Principles and Practice", (J.H. Fletcher, et al„ eds., 1974) at pages 103-120.<br>
The designation " ~"""" " refers to a bond that protrudes forward out of the plane<br>
of the page. The designation......'" " refers to a bond that protrudes backward out of the<br>
plane of the page. The designation " "^^ " refers to a bond wherein the stereochemistry<br>
is not defined.<br>
The compounds of Formulae I-IV, when existing as a diastereomeric mixture,<br>
may be separated into diastereomeric pairs of enantiomers by, for example, fractional<br>
crystallization from a suitable solvent, for example methanol or ethyl acetate or a mixture<br>
thereof. The pair of enantiomers thus obtained may be separated into individual<br>
stereoisomers by conventional means, for example by the use of an optically active acid<br>
as a resolving agent. Alternatively, any enantiomer of a compound of Formulae I-IV may<br>
be obtained by stereospecific synthesis using optically pure starting materials or reagents<br>
of known configuration or through enantioselective synthesis.<br>
The term "enantiomeric enrichment" as used herein refers to the increase in the<br>
amount of one enantiomer as compared to the other. A convenient method of expressing<br>
the enantiomeric enrichment achieved is the concept of enantiomeric excess, or "ee," .<br>
which is found using the following equation:<br><br>
wherein E1 is the amount of the first enantiomer and E2 is the amount of me<br>
second enantiomer. Thus, if the initial ratio of the two enantiomers is 50:50, such as is<br>
present in a racemic mixture, and an enantiomeric enrichment sufficient to produce a final<br>
ratio of 70:30 is achieved, the ee with respect to the first enantiomer is 40%. However, if<br>
the final ratio is 90:10, the ee with respect to the first enantiomer is 80%. An ee of<br>
greater than 90% is preferred, an ee of greater than 95% is most preferred and an ee of<br>
greater than 99% is most especially preferred. Enantiomeric enrichment is readily<br>
determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using standard techniques and procedures,<br>
such as gas or high performance liquid chromatography with a chiral column. Choice of<br>
the appropriate chiral column, eluent and conditions necessary to effect separation of the<br>
enantiomeric pair is well within the knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art. In<br>
addition, the specific stereoisomers and enantiomers of compounds of Formulae I-IV can<br>
be prepared by one of ordinary skill in the art utilizing well known techniques and<br>
processes, such as those disclosed by J. Jacques, et al., "Enantiomers, Racemates, and<br>
Resolutions." John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 1981, and EX. Eliel and S.H. Wilen,"<br>
Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds." (Wiley-Interscience 1994), and European<br>
Patent Application No. EP-A-838448, published April 29,1998. Examples of resolutions<br>
include recrystallization techniques or chiral chromatography.<br>
In general, the term "pharmaceutical" when used as an adjective means<br>
substantially non-toxic to living organisms. For example, the term "pharmaceutical salt"<br>
as used herein, refers to salts of the compounds of Formulae I-IV which are substantially<br>
non-toxic to living organisms. See, e.g,, Berge, S.M, Bighley, L.D., and Monkhouse,<br>
D.C., "Pharmaceutical Salts," J. Pharm. Sci., 66:1,1977. The present invention also<br>
encompasses pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present compounds. Such salts<br>
include pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts, pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
metal salts, ammonium and alkylated ammonium salts. Also intended as pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable acid addition salts are any hydrates that the present compounds are able to<br>
form. Furthermore, the pharmaceutically acceptable salts comprise basic amino acid salts<br>
such as lysine, arginine and ornithine. Typical pharmaceutical salts include those salts<br>
prepared by reaction of the compounds of Formulae I-IV with an inorganic or organic<br>
acid or base. Such salts are known as acid addition or base addition salts respectively.<br>
These pharmaceutical salts frequently have enhanced solubility characteristics compared<br>
to the compound from which they are derived, and thus are often more amenable to<br>
formulation as liquids or emulsions.<br>
/ The term "acid addition salt" refers to a salt of a compound of Formulae I-IV<br>
prepared by reaction of a compound of Formulae I-IV with a mineral or organic acid. For<br>
exemplification of pharmaceutical acid addition salts see, e.g., Berge, S.M, Bighley, L.D.,<br>
and Monkhouse, D.C., /. Pharm. Sci., 66:1,1977. Since compounds of this invention can<br>
be basic in nature, they accordingly react with any of a number of inorganic and organic<br>
acids to form pharmaceutical acid addition salts.<br>
The acid addition salts may be obtained as the direct products of compound<br>
synthesis. In the alternative, the free base may be dissolved in a suitable solvent<br>
containing the appropriate acid, and the salt isolated by evaporating the solvent or<br>
otherwise separating the salt and solvent<br>
Acids commonly employed to form acid addition salts are inorganic acids such as<br>
hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, and<br>
the like, and organic acids, such as p-toluenesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid,<br>
methanesulfonic acid, oxalic acid, p-bromophenylsulfonic acid, carbonic acid, succinic<br>
acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, benzoic acid, acetic acid and the like. Preferred<br>
pharmaceutical acid addition salts are those formed with mineral acids such as<br>
hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, and sulfuric acid, and tiiose formed with organic<br>
acids such as maleic acid, tartaric acid, and methanesulfonic acid. Examples of such<br>
pharmaceutivally acceptable salts thus are the sulfate, pyrosulfate, bisulfate, sulfite,<br>
bisulfite, phosphate, monohydrogenphosphate, dihydrogenphosphate, metaphosphate,<br>
pyrophosphate, chloride, bromide, iodide, acetate, propionate, decanoate, caprylate,<br>
acrylate, formate, isobutyrate, caproate, heptanoate, propiolate, oxalate, malonate,<br>
succinate, suberate, sebacate, fumarate, maleate, butyne-l,4-dioate, hexyne-l,6-dioate,<br>
benzoate, chlorobenzoate, methylbenzoate, dinitrobenzoate, hydroxybenzoate,<br>
methoxybenzoate, phthalate, sulfonate, xylenesulfonate, phenylacetate, phenylpropionate,<br>
phenylbutyrate, citrate, lactate, (3-hydroxybutyrate, glycollate, tartrate, methanesulfonate,<br>
propanesulfonate, naphthalene-1-sulfonate, naphthalene-2-sulfonate, mandelate and the<br>
like.<br>
The skilled artisan would appreciate that some compounds of Formulae I-IV may<br>
be acidic in nature and accordingly react with any of a number of inorganic and organic<br>
bases to form pharmaceutical base addition salts. The term "base addition salt" refers to a<br>
salt of a compound of Formulae I-IV prepared by reaction of a compound of Formula I,<br>
H, or IE with a mineral or organic base. For exemplification of pharmaceutical base<br>
addition salts see, eg., Berge, S.M, Bighley, L.D., and Monkhouse, D.C., J. Pharm. ScL,<br>
66:1,1977. Bases commonly employed to form pharmaceutical base addition salts are<br>
inorganic bases, such as ammonium or alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxides,<br>
carbonates, bicarbonates, and the like. Such bases useful in preparing the salts of this<br>
invention thus include sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide,<br>
potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium bicarbonate,<br>
calcium hydroxide, calcium carbonate, and the like. Examples of pharmaceutical base<br>
addition salts are the ammonium, lithium, potassium, sodium, calcium, magnesium,<br>
methylamino, diethylamino, ethylene diamino, cyclohexylamino, and ethanolamino salts,<br>
and the like of a compound of Formulae I-IV. The potassium and sodium salt forms are<br>
particularly preferred. The present invention also contemplates pharmaceutical base<br>
addition salts of compounds of Formulae I-IV.<br>
The pharmaceutical salts of the invention are typically formed by reacting a<br>
compound of Formulae I-IV with an equiraolar or excess amount of acid or base. The<br>
reactants are generally combined in a mutual solvent such as diethylether,<br>
tetrahydrofuran, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, benzene, and the like for acid addition<br>
salts, or water, an alcohol or a chlorinated solvent such as dichloromethane for base<br>
addition salts. The salts normally precipitate out of solution within about one hour to<br>
about ten days and can be isolated by filtration or other conventional methods.<br>
It should be recognized that the particular counterion forming a part of any salt of<br>
this invention is not of a critical nature, so long as the salt as a whole is<br>
pharmacologically acceptable and as long as the counterion does not contribute undesired<br>
qualities to the salt as a whole.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may form solvates with standard low<br>
molecular weight solvents using methods well known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
Such solvates are also contemplated as being within the scope of the present invention.<br>
The invention also encompasses prodrugs of the present compounds, which on<br>
administration undergo chemical conversion by metabolic processes before becoming<br>
pharmacologically active substances. In general, such prodrugs will be functional<br>
derivatives of present compounds, which are readily convertible in vivo into a compound<br>
of the present invention. Conventional procedures for the selection and preparation of<br>
Amiable prodrug derivatives are described, for example in "Design of Prodrugs", ed. H.<br>
Bundgaard, Elsevier, 1985.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention the present compounds are administered in<br>
combination with one or more further active substances in any suitable ratios. Such<br>
further active substances may for example be selected from antidiabetics, antiobesity<br>
agents, antihypertensive agents, agents for die treatment of complications resulting from<br>
or associated with diabetes and agents for the treatment of complications and disorders<br>
resulting from or associated with obesity. The following listing sets out several groups of<br>
combinations. It will be understood that each of the agents named may be combined with<br>
other agents named to create additional combinations.<br>

of Formulae I-IV is dependent upon the particular compound being synthesized, the<br>
starting compound, and the relative liability of the substituted moieties. The reagents or<br>
starting materials are readily available to one of skill in the art, and to the extent not<br>
commercially available, are readily synthesized by one of ordinary skill in the art<br>
following standard procedures commonly employed in the art, along with the various<br>
procedures and schemes set forth below.<br>
The following Schemes, Preparations, Examples and Procedures are provided to<br>
better elucidate the practice of the present invention and should not be interpreted in any<br>
way as to limit the scope of the same. Those skilled in the art will recognize that various<br>
modifications may be made while not departing from the spirit and scope of the<br>
invention. All publications mentioned in the specification are indicative of the level of<br>
those skilled in the art to which this invention pertains.<br>
The optimal time for performing the reactions of the Schemes, Preparations,<br>
Examples and Procedures can be determined by monitoring the progress of the reaction<br>
via conventional chromatographic techniques. Furthermore, it is preferred to conduct the<br>
reactions of the invention under an inert atmosphere, such as, for example, argon, or,<br>
particularly, nitrogen. Choice of solvent is generally not critical so long as the solvent<br>
employed is inert to the ongoing reaction and sufficiently solubilizes the reactants to<br>
effect the desired reaction. The compounds are preferably isolated and purified before<br>
their use in subsequent reactions. Some compounds may crystallize out of the reaction<br>
solution during their formation and then collected by filtration, or the reaction solvent<br>
may be removed by extraction, evaporation, or decantation. The intermediates and final<br>
products of Formulae I-IV may be further purified, if desired by common techniques such<br>
as recrystallization or chromatography over solid supports such as silica gel or alumina.<br>
The skilled artisan will appreciate that not all substituents are compatible with all<br>
reaction conditions. These compounds may be protected or modified at a convenient point<br>
in the synthesis by methods well known in the art.<br>

are well known to those skilled in the art. Generally, the human oral dosage form<br>
containing the active ingredients can be administered 1 or 2 times per day.<br>
PHARMACOLOGICAL METHODS<br>
In the following section binding assays as well as functional assays useful for<br>
evaluating the efficiency of the compounds of me invention are described.<br>
Binding of compounds to the glucagon receptor may be determined in a<br>
competition binding assay using the cloned human glucagon receptor. Antagonism may<br>
be determined as the ability of the compounds to inhibit the amount of cAMP formed in<br>
the presence of 5 nM glucagon.<br>
Glucagon Receptor (hGlucR) Binding Assay<br>
The receptor binding assay uses cloned human glucagon receptor (Lok S, Kuijper<br>
JL, Jelinek LI, Kramer IM, Whitmore TE, Sprecher CA, Mathewes S, Grant FJ, Biggs<br>
SH, Rosenberg GB, et al.Gene 140 (2), 203-209 (1994)) isolated from 293HEK<br>
membranes. The hGlucR cDNA is subcloned into the expression plasmid phD (Trans-<br>
activated expression of fully gamma-carboxylated recombinant human protein C, an<br>
antithrombotic factor. GrinneU, B.W., Berg, D.T., Walls, J. and Yan, S.B.<br>
Bio/Technology 5: 1189-1192 (1987)). This plasmid DNA was transfected into 293 HEK<br>
cells and selected with 200 ug/ml Hygromycin.<br>
Crude plasma membranes are prepared using cells from suspension culture. The<br>
cells are lysed on ice in hypotonic buffer containing 25 mM Tris HCL, pH 7.5,1 mM<br>
MgC12, DNAsel, 20 u/ml, and Roche Complete Inhibitors-without EDTA. The cell<br>
suspension is homogenized with a glass dounce homogenizer using a Teflon pestle for 25<br>
strokes. The homogenate is centrifuged at 4 degrees C at 1800 x g for 15 mins. The<br>
supernate is collected and the pellet is resuspended in hypotonic buffer and<br>
rehomogenized. The mixture is centrifuged at 1800 x g for 15 mins. The second<br>
supernate is combined with the first supernate. The combined supernates are<br>
recentrifuged at 1800 x g for 15 mins to clarify. The clarified supernate is transferred to<br>
high speed tubes and centrifuged at 25000 x g for 30 minutes at 4 degrees C. The<br>
membrane pellet is resuspended in homogenization buffer and stored as frozen aliquots at<br>
-80 degree C freezer until needed.<br>
Glucagon is radioiodinated by I-125-lactoperoxidase procedure and purified by<br>
reversed phase HPLC at Perkin-Elmer/NEN (NEX207). The specific activity is 2200<br>
Ci/mmol. Kd determination is performed by homologous competition instead of<br>
saturation binding due to high propanol content in the 1-125 glucagon material. The Kd is<br>
estimated to be 3 nM and is used to calculate Ki values for all compounds tested.<br>
The binding assays are carried out using a Scintillation Proximity Assay<br>
(Amersham) with WGA beads previously blocked with 1% fatty acid free BSA (ICN).<br>
The binding buffer contains 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 2.5 mM CaC12,1 mM MgCl2,0.1%<br>
fatty acid free BSA, (ICN), 0.003% tween-20, and Roche Complete Inhibitors without<br>
EDTA. Glucagon is dissolved in 0.01 N HC1 at 1 mg/ml and immediately frozen at -80<br>
degrees C in 30 ul aliquots. The glucagon aliquot is diluted and used in binding assays<br>
within an hour. Test compounds are dissolved in DMSO and serially diluted in DMSO.<br>
10 ul diluted compounds or DMSO is transferred into Coming 3632, opaque clear bottom<br>
assay plates containing 90 ul assay binding buffer or cold glucagon (NSB at 1 uM final).<br>
50 ul of 1-125 glucagon (0.15 nM final in reaction), 50 ul of membranes (300 ug/well),<br>
and 40 ul of WGA beads (150 ugs/well) are added, covered, and mixed end over end.<br>
Plates are read with a MicroBeta after 14 hours of settling time at room temp.<br>
Results are calculated as a percent of specific I-125-glucagon binding in the<br>
presence of compound. The absolute EC50 dose of compound is derived by non-linear<br>
regression of percent specific binding of I- 125-glucagon vs. the dose of compound added.<br>
The EC50 dose is converted to Ki using the Cheng-Prusoff equation (Cheng Y., Prusoff<br>
W. H., Biochem. Pharmacol. 22,3099-3108,1973).<br>
Glucagon -Like - Peptide 1 (Glpl-R) Receptor Binding Assay<br>
The receptor binding assay uses cloned human glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor<br>
(hGlpl-R) (Graziano MP, Hey PJ, Borkowski D, Chicchi GG, Strader CD, Biochem<br>
Biophys Res Commun. 1993 Oct 15;196(l):141-6) isolated from 293HEK membranes.<br>
The hGlpl-R cDNA is subcloned into the expression plasmid phD (Trans-activated<br>
expression of fully gamma-carboxylated recombinant human protein C, an antithrombotic<br>
factor. Grinnell, B.W., Berg, D.T., Walls, J. and Yan, S.B. Bio/Technology 5: 1189-<br>
1192 (1987)). This plasmid DNA is transfected into 293 HEK cells and selected with 200<br>
ug/ml Hygromycin.<br>
Crude plasma membrane is prepared using cells from suspension culture. The<br>
cells are lysed on ice in hypotonic buffer containing 25 mM Tris HCL, pH 7.5,1 mM<br>
MgC12, DNAse, 20 u/ml, and Roche Complete Inhibitors without EDTA. The cell<br>
suspension is homogenized with a glass dounce homogenizer using a Teflon pestle for 25<br>
strokes. The homogenate is centrifuged at 4 degrees C at 1800 x g for 15 mins. The<br>
supernate is collected and the pellet is resuspended in hypotonic buffer and<br>
rehomogenized. The mixture is centrifuged at 1800 x g for 15 mins. The second<br>
supernate is combined with the first supemate. The combined supernates are<br>
recentrifuged at 1800 x g for 15 mins to clarify. The clarified supernate is transferred to<br>
high speed tubes and centrifuged at 25000 x g for 30 minutes at 4 degrees C. The<br>
membrane pellet is resuspended in homogeniiation buffer and stored as frozen aliquots in<br>
-80 degree C freezer until use.<br>
Glucagaon-like peptide 1 (Glp-1) is radioiodinated by the I-125-lactoperoxidase<br>
procedure and purified by reversed phase HPLC at Perkin-Elmer/NEN (NEX308). The<br>
specific activity is 2200 Ci/mmol. Kd determination is performed by homologous<br>
competition instead of saturation binding due to high propanol content in the 1-125 Glp-1<br>
material. The Kd is estimated to be 3 nM and is used to calculate Ki values for all<br>
compounds tested.<br>
The binding assays are carried out using a Scintillation Proximity Assay<br>
(Amersham) with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) beads previously blocked with 1% fatty<br>
acid free BSA (ICN). The binding buffer contains 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.4,2.5 mM CaC12,<br>
1 mM MgC12,0.1% fatty acid free BSA, (ICN), 0.003% tween-20, and Roche Complete<br>
Inhibitors without EDTA. Glucagon-like peptide 1 is dissolved in PBS at 1 mg/ml and<br>
immediately frozen at -80 degrees C in 30 ul aliquots. The glucagon-like peptide aliquot<br>
is diluted and used in binding assays within an hour. Test compounds are dissolved in<br>
DMSO and serially diluted in DMSO. 10 ul diluted compounds or DMSO is transferred<br>
into Corning 3632, opaque clear bottom assay plates containing 90 ul assay binding<br>
buffer or cold glucagon-like peptide 1 (NSB at 1 uM final). 50 ul of 1-125 glucagon-like<br>
peptide 1 (0.15 nM final in reaction), 50 ul of membranes (600 ug/well), and 40 ul of<br>
WGA beads (150 ugs/well) are added, covered, and mixed end over end. Plates are read<br>
with a MicroBeta after 14 hours of settling time at room temp.<br>
Results are calculated as a percent of specific I-125-glucagon-like peptide 1<br>
binding in the presence of compound. The absolute EC50 dose of compound isderived<br>
by non-linear regression of percent specific binding of I-125-glucagon-like peptide 1 vs.<br>
the dose of compound added. The EC50 dose is converted to Ki using the Cheng-Prusoff<br>
equation (Cheng Y., Prusoff W. H., Biochem. Pharmacol. 22, 3099-3108,1973).<br>
Glucagon-Stimulated cAMP Functional Antagonist Assay<br>
The cAMP functional assay uses the same cloned human glucagon receptor cell<br>
line isolated for the hGlucR binding assay described above. Cells are stimulated with a<br>
mixture of an EC80 dose of glucagon in the presence of compound. The cAMP generated<br>
within the cell is quantitated using an Amplified Luminescent Proximity Homogeneous<br>
Assay, Alpha Screen, from Perkin Elmer (6760625R). Briefly, cAMP within the cell<br>
competes for binding of biotinylated cAMP from the kit to a coated anti-cAMP antibody<br>
Acceptor bead and a strepavidin coated Donor bead. As the cAMP level within the cell<br>
increases, a disruption of the Acceptor bead-biotinlyated cAMP -Donor bead complex<br>
occurs and decreases the signal.<br>
Glucagon is dissolved in 0.01 N HC1 at 1 mg/ml and immediately frozen at -80<br>
degrees C in 30 ul aliquots. The glucagon aliquot is diluted and used in the functional<br>
assay within an hour. Cells are harvested from sub-confluent tissue culture dishes with<br>
Enzyme-Free Cell.Dissociation Solution, (Specialty Media 5-004-B). The cells are<br>
pelleted at low speed and washed 3 times with assay buffer [25 mM Hepes in HBSS-with<br>
Mg and Ca (GIBCO, 14025-092) with 0.1% Fatty Acid Free BSA (ICN)] then diluted to a<br>
final concentration of 250,000 cells per ml. Compounds are serially diluted into DMSO<br>
then diluted into assay buffer with a 3X concentration of glucagon and 3% DMSO. The<br>
EC80 of glucagon is pre-determined from a full glucagon dose response and represents<br>
the dose at which glucagons produces an 80% of the maximal glucagon response, A<br>
mixture of biotinylated cAMP (1 unit/well final) from the Alpha Screen Kit and 3X<br>
IBMX (1500 uM) is prepared in Assay Buffer.<br>
The functional assay is performed in 96 well, low-volume, white, poylstyrene<br>
Costar Plates (3688). The biotinylated cAMP/IBMX mixture, 0.02 mis, is placed into<br>
each well, followed by addition of 0.02 mis of glucagon dose response, cAMP standard<br>
curve, or compound/glucagon mixtures. The reaction is started by addition of 0.02 mis of<br>
cells (5000/well final). After 60 minutes at room temperature, the reaction is stopped by<br>
the addition of 0.03 mis of Lysis Buffer [10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4,1% NP40, and 0.01%<br>
fatty acid free BSA (ICN) containing 1 unit each/well of Acceptor and Donor beads from<br>
the Alpha Screen Kit]. Lysis Buffer addition is performed under a green light to prevent<br>
bleaching of the detection beads. The plates are wrapped in foil and left to equilibrate<br>
overnight at room temperature. The plates are read on a Packard Fusion™-Instrument<br>
Alpha screen units are converted to pmoles cAMP generated per well based upon<br>
the cAMP standard curve. The pmoles cAMP produced in the presence of compound are<br>
converted to % of a maximal response with the EC80 dose of glucagon alone. With each<br>
experiment, the dose of glucagon needed to produce a 50% response of pmoles cAMP is<br>
determined. This EC50 dose is used to normalize results to a Kb using a modified<br>
Cheng-Prusoff equation (Cheng Y., Prusoff W. H., Biochem. Pharmacol. 22,3099-3108,<br>
1973), where Kb = (EC50 compound)/ [1 + (pM glucagon used/ EC50 in pM for<br>
glucagon dose response)].<br>
In general the compounds according to the invention have a Ki value of less than<br>
50µM as determined by the Glucagon Receptor (hGlucR) Binding Assay disclosed<br>
herein. The examples provided have Ki values of less than 50µM. Preferably the<br>
compounds according to the invention have a Ki value of less than 5uM, and more<br>
preferably of less than 500 nM, and even more preferred of less than 100 nM, as<br>
determined by the Glucagon Receptor (hGlucR) Binding Assay disclosed herein.<br>
Generally, the compounds according to.the invention show a higher affinity for the<br>
glucagon receptor compared to the GLP-1 receptor, and preferably have a 10 to 10000<br>
fold higher binding affinity for the glucagon receptor than for the GLP-1 receptor.<br>
