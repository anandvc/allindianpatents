Elevator monitoring unit and procedure for the maintenance of an elevator monitoring unit<br>
The invention concerns an elevator monitoring unit in the case of an elevator hoistway termination, in accordance with the generic term of the independent patent claims.<br>
The elevator monitoring unit comprises the necessary electrical subassemblies for the control and regulation of the elevator and particularly of the elevator drive. Furthermore, ordinary elevator monitoring units contain today the interfaces and input modules necessary for maintenance and diagnostics. In case of elevators with no engine room, this elevator monitoring unit is placed advantageously within the ranges of the elevator hoistway termination.<br>
The elevator hoistway lock enables the access from the floor to the car. It consists essentially of movable doors and of door frame fastened in the building, which among other things exhibits at least two vertical door posts.<br>
The installation of electrical devices (or an elevator monitoring unit) in the elevator hoistway termination or in the door post is well-known from the patent document SU 1 654 214. These solutions were refined with the patent specifications EP 0680921 and JP 03018569. These solutions swivel thereby the door post, or respectively the relevant door post part around the vertical axle to the side.<br>
A disadvantage of this solution consists in this respect that caused by the swivelling movement a large aperture area is necessary, or the access to the controlling equipment is difficult.<br>
The requisite maintenance works in the elevator monitoring unit cause an unrestricted as possible access to all sub-assembly elements. This causes an accordingly large aperture, which, in the case of the well-known solutions, can be realised only by a large aperture angle with the associated space requirement.<br><br>
The invention underlies the task to suggest an arrangement of the elevator monitoring unit in the hoistway termination, which bypasses the described disadvantages and in particular makes possible a special space saving arrangement of the elevator monitoring unit in the hoistway termination. The placement of the elevator monitoring unit should be possible on each floor, without any change of the installation dimension. The solution should be able to be managed with proven components and procedures of the elevator construction. The production should be to take place economically and at low costs. The access to the elevator monitoring unit should be safe and simply possible for authorised persons, however it should be able to be protected from the access by unauthorised ones.<br>
The solutions indicated in the generic terms of the independent patent claims fulfil this task.<br>
In the following, the invention is represented in the figures based on embodiment examples. They show:<br>

Figure 4       an  embodiment   example   of a  door  post  (5)   with  horizontal parallel movable door post element (6).<br>
An elevator monitoring unit (10) is, according to the invention, arranged on at least one door post element (6). The door post element (6) is inserted in a door post (5). The door post element (6) can be opened from the door post (5) and makes possible, in this condition, the access to the elevator monitoring unit (10). In the closed condition, the elevator monitoring unit (10) is not accessible from the outside. The attachment of the door post element (6) in the door post (5) is in such a manner executed that the door post (6) can be parallel-shifted to a large extent along a horizontal axle (Y) or be tilted around a horizontal axle (X). On this occasion, the elevator monitoring unit (10) is usually installed on a door post element (6), in the ideal case in the construction work, and extensively cabled.<br>
The represented solution permits an economic production. The solution permits a simple, safe and fast access to the elevator monitoring unit (10) for the purpose of maintenance, repair, and diagnostics or for special purposes. Special purposes are all interventions as for example fire-brigade operation, emergency evacuation or electric network controls.<br>
The installation of the elevator monitoring unit (10) can, in case of need, be divided on several door post elements (6) or on further places, if due to the space requirement, the accessibility, or the functional separation of the elevator monitoring unit (10), this is judged as meaningful. Parts of the elevator monitoring unit (10), for which the fast access is of subordinated importance, are placed in the rule according to their function. So, for example, the transformer, belonging to the elevator driving gear, can be self-placed with the elevator drive, and only the command module is located on a door post element (6).<br>
In a preferred variant, the attachment of the door post element (6) is executed as parallelogram over two levers each arranged within the lower<br><br>
and upper door jamb range (8a, 8b). The closed position of the door post element (6) is placed thereby preferably slightly behind the upper vertex position (tilting point) of the lever system formed by the lever arrangement. The closed position of the door post element (6) is usually secured with a locking device (9). The door post element (6) forms, in this closed situation and from the user desired, an aesthetic and as pleasantly constructed line or surface with the door post. The locking device (9) forms a possibility to protect the elevator monitoring unit (10) against unauthorized access, however at the same time of simply permitting the access for authorised users.<br>
When opening, the door post element (6) is moved together with the mounted elevator monitoring unit (10) according to the lever geometry (8a, 8b) parallel outwards and downwards, until the movement is delimited by the floor bottom (4) or by an integrated stop motion device (11). The lever geometry is displayed in such a manner that the elevator monitoring unit is in such a manner accessible (10) for the necessary interventions that a fast and safe execution of the necessary works, such as maintenance, repair, service and diagnostics or special purposes, becomes possible. Because of the favourable parallel shift in Y, Z-direction, with the opening of the door post element (6) from the door post (5) is the necessary space requirement in the access minimal. In the represented example, it amounts to approximately 0.15 m in the Y-direction.<br>
The door post element (6) is structurally in such a manner arranged that, in the opened position of the door post element (6), the components of the elevator monitoring unit (10) are accessible from two sides. This execution improves the accessibility for the necessary interventions.<br>
In another variant, the parallelogram described above is replaced by a tilting mechanics, whereby the door post element (6) is placed at the bottom in a pivoting manner (12) without lever, and the tilting motion is reached lone by the rotation of the upper point of the door post. The opening distance can be defined thereby by a linkage, an extension joint bar (8c) or an outside tilting delimitation. This solution permits a low-cost execution in comparison to the previous described variant, since the lower levers are omitted.<br><br>
A further variant consists therein that the opening mechanics is displayed in such a manner that the door post element is self-locking (6). This is achieved, for example, as the door post element (6) is held in its closed position by means of a locking spring (13). In an opened condition, the door post element (6) is fixed by means of a locking device. The locking device can be a stopping lever, or be the locking spring (13) itself, for example by means of a break-over point arrangement as shown in Figure 2a, in such a manner arranged that the door post element (6) is held in the opened position and is pulled into the closed position after the introduction of the closing process. Alternatively, the arrangement shown in the Figures 2 and 3 can be inverted as it appears from the Figures 2b and 3b. So the lever geometry (8a, 8b) can be arranged in such a manner that the door post element (6) is moved parallel outwards and upwards (Figure 2b), whereby it falls, in case of load alleviation, autonomously into its lower, closed situation, or the alternatively shown tilting mechanics is provided with an axis of rotation (12) (Figure 3a) located at the top. With these solutions, a locking device is necessary, the locking device being for example in the form of a locking lever (14), which holds the door post element in the opened position. The described alternatives represent individual solutions to the closing and opening mechanics of the door post element.<br>
In an execution variant, a storeys indicator board (7) is integrated directly into the door post element (6).<br>
The execution of the elevator monitoring unit (10) is in such a preferred manner arranged that the dimension given by the entrance height of the hoistway termination is used and thus, the elevator monitoring unit (10) can be arranged to a large extent completely within the door post (5). In the example shown, the height of the door post element (6) amounts to approximately 1.3 m with a width of approximately 0.12 m. Through this space-saving arrangement, an optimal utilisation of the building area in the door post (5) is reached, whereby a flexible arrangement of the elevator monitoring unit (10) is made possible independently of the door post dimensions in each floor. The place requirement for the individual floor is independent from the arrangement of the elevator monitoring unit (10).<br><br>
In the Figures 2 to 4, the door post element (6) with the elevator monitoring unit (10) is shown as parallel-shifted horizontally (Y) or tiltable around a horizontal axle (X). In an alternative arrangement, to be seen in Figure lb, a door post element (6') with the elevator monitoring unit (10) is built in turned at 90° around a vertical axle (Z). It is horizontal, in this arrangement and can be parallel-shifted in X-direction or can be placed tiltable around a horizontal axle (Y). This arrangement offers advantages in the configuration of the door frames, as for example the front of the door posts can be round, skewed or being of any form.<br>
By the attachment of a fireproof assembling box in the door post (5), the necessary fire-protective class of the concerned hoistway termination can be ensured without restriction.<br>
With knowledge of the present invention, the man skilled in the art can change the set sizes and arrangements at will. For example, the space requirement shown can appropriately be increased or made smaller by 0.15 m.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
