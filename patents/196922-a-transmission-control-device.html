				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
(a)	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an automatic transmission for use in an automobile, and more particularly, to a transmission control system for controlling a transmission mechanism of an automatic transmission for use in an automobile, in a case in which another transmission shift request occurs while a gear-shifting operation is currently being performed.<br>
(b)	Description of the Related Art<br>
In the prior art automatic transmission, if a new transmission shift request is input to a transmission control unit that is currently performing a particular gear-shifting operation, the transmission control unit triggers a gear-sfiifting operation of the newly requested transmission shift request immediately, regardless of whether the foregoing gear-shifting operation is completed.<br>
Since the foregoing gear-shifting operation is abruptly stopped as soon /as the new transmission shift request occurs, applying/releasing actions of hydraulic pressure of the foregoing gear-shifting operation are ceased in an unfinished state. In this situation, when the new gear-shifting operation for the new transmission shift request is immediately started, newly triggering application of the hydraulic pressure, there may be a shifting shock due to an interlock of the hydraulic pressure in some hydraulic ports or the like, degrading quality of the shifting operation of the transmission.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been made in an effort to overcome the problem described above.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a transmission control device for controlling a transmission mechanism of an automatic transmission for use in an automobile, which is capable of preventing an abnormal shifting shock from occurring in a case that a new transmission shift request occurs while a particular gear-shifting operation is currently being performed, and which is capable of completely performing a new gear-shifting operation of the new transmission shift request.<br>
To achieve the above object, the present invention provides a transmission control device for controlling of an automatic transmission mechanism, when a new transmission shift request occurs while a prior gear-shifting operation is still being performed, comprising:<br>
-a lever whose position is changeable through a lever shifting action by a driver selecting a transmission stage to be changed into;<br>
- a transmission stage detection unit (110) for detecting a new position of the lever due to the lever-shifting action, and outputting corresponding signals; and<br>
-	a transmission control unit (120) receiving the signals from the<br>
transmission stage detection unit (110) and performing a gear-shifting<br>
operation of the transmission,<br>
-	the said transmission control unit (120) having therein a time map being of<br>
a number of values of permissible time intervals that respectively correspond<br>
to all kinds of gear-shifting operations of the transmission, and , when the<br>
new transmission shift request is input to the transmission control unit (120)<br>
currently performing a prior gear-shifting operation, the transmission control<br>
unit allows the prior gear-shifting operation to be held only during a<br>
corresponding permissible time interval set in the time map and then<br>
performs the newly requested gear-shifting operation (S230)<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, the transmission control system further comprises a time functioning to monitor a lapse of the permissible time interval and sending signals corresponding to a current time to the transmission control unit.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, if the foregoing gear-shifring operation is completed before the permissible time interval is fully elapsed, the transmission control unit performs the new gear-shifting operation of the new transmission shift request immediately.<br>
Further, the present invention provides a transmission control method for controlling a transmission mechanism of an automatic transmission in a case in<br>
which a new transmission shift request occurs while a foregoing gear-shifting operation is currently being performed, the method comprising the steps of: (a) performing the foregoing gear-shifting operation; (b) determining whether the new transmission shift request exists while the forgoing gear-shifting operation is being performed; (c) obtaining a permissible time interval related to the forgoing gear-shifting operation from a time map, if the new transmission shift request exists in the step; (d) continuing to perform the foregoing gear-shifting operation during the permissible time interval obtained from the time map, while delaying a new gear-shifting operation of the new transmission shift request; and (e) performing the new gear-shifting operation after the permissible time interval has elapsed.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of the specification, illustrate an embodiment of the invention, and, together with the description, serve to explain the principles of the invention:<br>
Figure 1 is a block diagram of a inventive system for controlling a transmission mechanism of an automatic transmission for use in an automobile; and<br>
Figure 2 is a flow chart showing an inventive method for controlling a transmission mechanism of the automatic transmission in a case that a new transmission shift request occurs while a forgoing gear-shifting operation is still being performed.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will hereinafter be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
FIG. 1 depicts a block diagram of a transmission control system for controlling the transmission during a gear-shifting operation of the transmission in accordance with the present invention.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, an inventive transmission control system for use in an automobile is provided with a shift lever 100, a transmission stage detection unit 110, a transmission control unit 120, and a timer 130.<br>
A transmission stage to be changed into is selected by a lever-shifting action of the shift lever 100 by the driver.<br>
The transmission stage detection unit 110 detects a new position of the shift lever 100 due to the lever-shifting action and outputs corresponding signals.<br><br>
The transmission control unit 120 receives the signals from the transmission stage detection unit 110, which correspond to the position of the shift lever 100 due to the lever-shifting action and performs the gear-shifting operation of the transmission. Further, the transmission control unit 120 has a time map being of a number of values of permissible time intervals that respectively correspond to all kinds of gear-shifting operations of the transmission. In a case that a new transmission shift request occurs when a certain gear-shifting operation is currently underway, the transmission control unit 120 allows the current gear-shifting operation to be held only during the corresponding permissible time interval set in the time map and then performs the newly requested gear-shifting operation.<br>
The timer 130 functions to monitor the lapse of the permissible time interval, in a case that the new transmission shift request occurs when the foregoing gear-shifting operation is currently underway, and sends signals corresponding to current time to the transmission control unit 120. It is possible that the timer 130 is established within the transmission control unit 120 as a part thereof.<br>
Hereinafter, a detailed description of a transmission control method in a case that a new transmission shift request occurs when a certain gear-shifting operation is currently underway, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, will be made with reference to Fig. 2.<br>
Firstly, when the driver selects a transmission stage to be changed into by manipulating the shift lever 100 (S210), the transmission stage detection unit 110 detects a change in position of the shift lever 100 and outputs signals<br>
corresponding to the change to the transmission control unit 120 (S220).<br>
Next, the transmission control unit 120, having received the signals corresponding to the position change of the shift lever 100, performs a related gear-shifting operation (S230).<br>
For example, if the shift lever 100 is set at a position indicating the second gear ratio when the automobile runs in the first gear ratio, the transmission control unit 120 triggers a gear-shifting operation from the first gear ratio to the second gear ratio.<br>
Further, the gear-shifting operation may be made without the driver manipulating the shift lever 100, since the external environment, to which the transmission control unit refers in determining timing of gear shifting, changes while the shift, lever 100 stays at a position indicating "Drive".<br>
As described above, when the position of the shift lever 100 is changed or the gear-shifting operation has to be performed due to a change of the external environment, the transmission control unit 120 triggers a related gear-shifting operation.<br>
The transmission control unit 120 also determines whether any signals requesting a transmission shift are newly input thereto due to the fact that the position of the shift lever 100 is changed or the gear-shifting operation has to be performed due to a change of the external environment, while performing the related gear-shifting operation (S240).<br>
If the signals are input during the gear-shifting operation triggered by the transmission control unit 120, the latter 120 obtains the permissible time interval related to the currently performed gear-shifting operation from the time<br>
map (S250).<br>
For example, if a permissible time interval related to a gear-shifting operation from the first gear ratio to the second gear ratio is set at 0.0 seconds in the time map, the transmission control unit 120 will obtain 0.0 seconds as the permissible time interval. Further, if a permissible time interval related to a gear-shifting operation from the first gear ratio to the second gear ratio is set at 1.2 seconds in the time map, the transmission control unit 120 will obtain 1.2 seconds as the permissible time interval.<br>
Next, the transmission control unit 120 continues to perform the gear-shifting operation currently being performed, while delaying a new gear-shifting operation of the new transmission shift request during the permissible time interval obtained from the time map (S260).<br>
If the permissible time interval is 0.0 seconds, the transmission control unit 120 immediately stops the gear-shifting operation currently being performed and then performs the new gear-shifting operation of the new transmission shift request without delay. If the permissible time interval is 1.2 seconds, the transmission control unit 120 allows the gear-shifting operation currently being performed to last for 1.2 seconds and then triggers the new gear-shifting operation of the new transmission shift request. At the time, if the gear-shifting operation currently being performed is completed before the permissible time interval is fully elapsed (S270), the transmission control unit 120 immediately triggers the new gear-shifting operation of the new transmission shift request, rather than waiting for the lapse of the rest of the permissible time interval (S290).<br>
Meanwhile, in the step S270, if the gear-shifting operation currently being performed is not completed, the transmission control unit 120 determines whether the permissible time interval has elapsed (S280) and continues to perform the gear-shifting operation currently being performed as in the step S260 until the permissible time interval is fully elapsed.<br>
On the other hand, in the step S240 where it is determined whether there are other signals requesting the new transmission shift, if there is no signal requesting the new transmission shift, the transmission control unit 120 determines whether the gear-shifting operation currently being performed is completed (S300). If the gear-shifting operation currently being performed is not completed, the transmission control unit 120 continues to perform the gear-shifting operation as in the steps S230 and S260, whereas the transmission control method in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is terminated if the gear-shifting operation is completed.<br>
While this invention has been described in connection with what is presently considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiment, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiments, but, on the contrary, is intended to cover various modifications and equivalent arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims.<br><br><br><br><br>
