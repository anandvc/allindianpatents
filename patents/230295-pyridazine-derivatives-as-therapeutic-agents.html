PYRIDAZINE DERIVATIVES AND THEIR USE AS THERAPEUTIC AGENTS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to the field of inhibitors of stearoyl-CoA desaturase, such as pyridazine derivatives, and uses for such compounds in treating and/or preventing various human diseases, including those mediated by stearoyJ-CoA desaturase (SCD) enzymes, preferably SCD1, especially diseases related to elevated lipid levels, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome and the like.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Acyl desaturase enzymes catalyze the formation of double bonds in fatty acids derived from either dietary sources or de novo synthesis in the liver. Mammals synthesize at least three fatty acid desaturases of differing chain length specificity that catalyze the addition of double bonds at the delta-9, delta-6, and deKa-5 positions. Stearoyl-CoA desaturases (SCDs) introduce a double bond in the C9-C10 position of saturated fatty acids. The preferred substrates are palmitoyl-CoA (16:0) and stearoyl-CoA (18:0), which are converted to palmitoleoyl-CoA (16:1) and oleoyl-CoA (18:1), respectively. The resulting mono-unsaturated fatty acids are substrates for incorporation into phospholipids, triglycerides, and cholesteryl esters.<br>
A number of mammalian SCD genes have been cloned. For example, two genes have been cloned from rat (SCD1, SCD2) and four SCD genes have been isolated from mouse (SCD1, 2, 3, and 4). While the basic biochemical role of SCD has been known in rats and mice since the 1970's (Jeffcoat, R. et a/., Elsevier Science (1984), Vol. 4, pp. 85-112; de Antueno, RJ, Lipids (1993), Vol. 28, No. 4, pp. 285-290), it has only recently been directly implicated in human disease processes.<br>
A single SCD gene, SCD1, has been characterized in humans. SCD1 is described in Brownlie et a/, PCT published patent application, WO 01/62954, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. A second human SCD isoform has recently been identified, and because it bears little sequence homology to alternate mouse or rat isoforms it has been named human SCD5 or hSCD5 (PCT published patent application, WO 02/26944, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).<br>
To date, no small-molecule, drug-like compounds are known that specifically inhibit or modulate SCD activity. Certain long-chain hydrocarbons have been used<br><br>
historically to study SCD activity. Known examples include thia-fatty acids, cyclopropenoid fatty acids, and certain conjugated linoleic acid isomers. Specifically, c/s-12, trans-10 conjugated linoleic acid is believed to inhibit SCD enzyme activity and reduce the abundance of SCD1 mRNA while c/s-9, trans-l1 conjugated linoleic acid does not. Cyclopropenoid fatty acids, such as those found in stercula and cotton seeds, are also known to inhibit SCD activity. For example, sterculic acid (8-(2-octylcyclopropenyI)octanoic acid) and malvalic acid (7-(2-octyIcyclopropenyl)heptanoic acid) are C18 and C16 derivatives of sterculoyl and malvaloyl fatty acids, respectively, having cyclopropene rings at their C9-C10 position. These agents are believed to inhibit SCD enzymatic activity by direct interaction with the enzyme, thus inhibiting delta-9 desaturation. Other agents that may inhibit SCD activity include thia-fatty acids, such as 9-thiastearic acid (also called 8-nonylthiooctanoic acid) and other fatty acids with a sulfoxy moiety.<br>
These known modulators of delta-9 desaturase activity are not useful for treating the diseases and disorders linked to SCD1 biological activity. None of the known SCD inhibitor compounds are selective for SCD or defta-9 desaturases, as they also inhibit other desaturases and enzymes. The thia-fatty acids, conjugated linoleic acids and cyclopropene fatty acids (malvalic acid and sterculic acid) are neither useful at reasonable physiological doses, nor are they specific inhibitors of SCD1 biological activity, rather they demonstrate cross inhibition of other desaturases, in particular the delta-5 and delta-6 desaturases by the cyclopropene fatty acids.<br>
The absence of small molecule inhibitors of SCD enzyme activity is a major scientific and medical disappointment because evidence is now compelling that SCD activity is directly implicated in common human disease processes: See e.g., Attie, A.D. et a/., "Relationship between stearoyl-CoA desaturase activity and plasma triglycerides in human and mouse hypertriglyceridemia", J. Lipid Res. (2002), Vol. 43, No. 11, pp. 1899-907; Cohen, P. et al., "Role for stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 in leptin-mediated weight loss", Science (2002), Vol. 297, No. 5579, pp. 240-3, Ntambi, J. M. et a/., "Loss of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 function protects mice against adiposity", Proc. Natl. Acad. ScL USA. (2002), Vol. 99, No. 7, pp. 11482-6.<br>
The present invention solves this problem by presenting new classes of compounds that are useful in modulating SCD activity and regulating lipid levels, especially plasma lipid levels, and which are useful in the treatment of SCD-mediated diseases such as diseases related to dyslipidemia and disorders of lipid metabolism, especially diseases related to elevated lipid levels, cardiovascular disease, diabetes,<br><br>
obesity, metabolic syndrome and the like.<br>

As used herein, the terms "disease" and "condition" may be used interchangeably or may be different in that the particular malady or condition may not have a known causative agent (so that etiology has not yet been worked out) and it is therefore not yet recognized as a disease but only as an undesirable condition or syndrome, wherein a more or less specific set of symptoms have been identified by clinicians.<br>
The compounds of the invention, or their pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts may contain one or more asymmetric centers and may thus give rise to enantiomers,<br><br>
diastereomers, and other stereoisomer^ forms that may be defined, in terms of absolute stereochemistry, as (f?)- or (S)- or, as (D)- or (L)- for amino acids. The present invention is meant to include all such possible isomers, as well as their racemic and optically pure forms. Optically active (+) and (-), (R)- and (S)-, or (D)- and (L)- isomers may be prepared using chiral synthons or chiral reagents, or resolved using conventional techniques, such as HPLC using a chiral column. When the compounds described herein contain olefinic double bonds or other centers of geometric asymmetry, and unless specified otherwise, it is intended that the compounds include both E and Z geometric isomers. Likewise, all tautomeric forms are also intended to be included.<br>
A "stereoisomer" refers to a compound made up of the same atoms bonded by the same bonds but having different three-dimensional structures, which are not interchangeable. The present invention contemplates various stereoisomers and mixtures thereof and includes "enantiomers", which refers to two stereoisomers whose molecules are nonsuperimposeable mirror images of one another.<br>
A "tautomer" refers to a proton shift from one atom of a molecule to another atom of the same molecule. The present invention includes tautomers of any said compounds.<br>
The chemical naming protocol and structure diagrams used herein employ and rely the chemical naming features as utilized by Chemdraw version 7.0.1 (available from Cambridgesoft Corp., Cambridge, MA). For complex chemical names employed herein, a substituent group is named before the group to which it attaches. For example, cyclopropylethyl comprises an ethyl backbone with cyclopropyl substituent In chemical structure diagrams, all bonds are identified, except for some carbon atoms which are assumed to be bonded to sufficient hydrogen atoms to complete the valency.<br>

The compounds identified in the instant specification inhibit the desaturation of various fatty acids (such as the C9-C10 desaturation of stearoyl-CoA) which is accomplished by delta-9 desaturases, such as stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1). As such these compounds inhibit the formation of various fatty acids and downstream metabolites thereof. This may lead to an accumulation of stearoyl-CoA or palmitoyl-CoA and other upstream precursors of various fatty acids; which may possibfy result in a negative feedback loop causing an overall change in fatty acid metabolism. Any of these consequences may ultimately be responsible for the overall therapeutic benefit provided by these compounds.<br>
Typically, a successful SCD inhibitory therapeutic agent will meet some or all of the following criteria. Oral availability should be at or above 20%. Animal model efficacy is less than about 2 mg/Kg, 1 mg/Kg, or 0.5 mg/Kg,and the target human dose is between 50 and 250 mg/70 Kg, although doses outside of this range may be acceptable.("mg/Kg" means milligrams of compound per kilogram of body mass of the subject to whom it is being administered). The therapeutic index (or ratio of toxic dose to therapeutic dose) should be greater than 100. The potency (as expressed by IC50 value) should be less than 10 |iM, preferably below 1 p.M and most preferably below 50 nM. The IC50 ("Inhibitory Concentration - 50%") is a measure of the amount of compound required to achieve 50% inhibition of SCD activity, over a specific time period, in an SCD biological activity assay. Any process for measuring the activity of SCD enzymes, preferably mouse or human SCD enzymes, may be utilized to assay the activity of the compounds useful in the methods of the invention in inhibiting said SCD activity. Compounds of the invention demonstrate an IC50 in a 15 minute microsomal assay of preferably less than 10 \iM, less than 5 p.M, less than 2.5 \iM, less than 1 nM, less than 750 nM, less than 500 nM, less than 250 nM, less than 100 nM, less than 50 nM, and most preferably less than 20 nM. The compound of the invention may show reversible inhibition (i.e., competitive inhibition) and preferably does not inhibit other iron binding proteins. The required dosage should preferably be no more than about once or twice a day or at meal times.<br>
The identification of compounds of the invention as SCD inhibitors was readily accomplished using the SCD enzyme and microsomal assay procedure described in<br><br>
Brownlie et al, supra. When tested in this assay, compounds of the invention had less than 50% remaining SCD activity at 10 pM concentration of the test compound, preferably less than 40% remaining SCD activity at 10 pM concentration of the test compound, more preferably less than 30% remaining SCD activity at 10 pM concentration of the test compound, and even more preferably less than 20% remaining SCD activity at 10 pM concentration of the test compound, thereby demonstrating that the compounds of the invention are potent inhibitors of SCD activity.<br>
These results provide the basis for analysis of the structure-activity relationship (SAR) between test compounds and SCD. Certain R groups tend to provide more potent inhibitory compounds. SAR analysis is one of the tools those skilled in the art may now employ to identify preferred embodiments of the compounds of the invention for use as therapeutic agents.<br>
Other methods of testing the compounds disclosed herein are also readily available to those skilled in the art. Thus, in addition, said contacting may be accomplished in vivo. In one such embodiment, said contacting in step (a) is accomplished by administering said chemical agent to an animal afflicted with a triglyceride (TG)- or very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)-related disorder and subsequently detecting a change in plasma triglyceride level in said animal thereby identifying a therapeutic agent useful in treating a triglyceride (TG)- or very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)-related disorder. In such embodiment, the animal may be a human, such as a human patient afflicted with such a disorder and in need of treatment of said disorder.<br>
In specific embodiments of such in vivo processes, said change in SCD1 activity in said animal is a decrease in activity, preferably wherein said SCD1 modulating agent does not substantially inhibit the biological activity of a delta-5 desaturase, delta-6 desaturase or fatty acid synthetase.<br>
The model systems useful for compound evaluation may include, but are not limited to, the use of liver microsomes, such as from mice that have been maintained on a high carbohydrate diet, or from human donors, including persons suffering from obesity. Immortalized cell lines, such as HepG2 (from human liver), MCF-7 (from human breast cancer) and 3T3-L1 (from mouse adipocytes) may also be used. Primary cell lines, such as mouse primary hepatocytes, are also useful in testing the compounds of the invention. Where whole animals are used, mice used as a source of primary hepatocyte cells may also be used wherein the mice have been maintained on<br><br>
a high carbohydrate diet to increase SCD activity in mirocrosomes and/or to elevate plasma triglyceride levels (i.e., the 18:1/18:0 ratio); alternatively mice on a normal diet or mice with normal triglyceride levels may be used. Mouse models employing transgenic mice designed for hypertriglyceridemia are also available as is the mouse phenome database. Rabbits and hamsters are also useful as animal models, especially those expressing CETP (cholesteryl ester transfer protein).<br>
Another suitable method for determining the in vivo efficacy of the compounds of the invention is to indirectly measure their impact on inhibition of SCD enzyme by measuring a subject's Desaturation Index after administration of the compound. "Desaturation Index* as employed in this specification means the ratio of the product over the substrate for the SCD enzyme as measured from a given tissue sample. This may be calculated using three different equations 18:1n-9/18:0 (oleic acid over stearic acid); 16:1n-7/16:0 (palmrtoleic acid over palmitic acid); and/or 16:1n-7 + 18:1 n-7/16:0 (measuring all reaction products of 16:0 desaturation over 16:0 substrate). Desaturation Index is primarily measured in liver or plasma triglycerides, but may also be measured in other selected lipid fractions from a variety of tissues. Desaturation Index, generally speaking, is a tool for plasma lipid profiling.<br>
A number of human diseases and disorders are the result of aberrant SCD1 biological activity and may be ameliorated by modulation of SCD1 biological activity using the therapeutic agents of the invention.<br>
Inhibition of SCD expression may also affect the fatty acid composition of membrane phospholipids, as well as production or levels of triglycerides and cholesterol esters. The fatty acid composition of phospholipids ultimately determines membrane fluidity, while the effects on the composition of triglycerides and cholesterol esters can affect lipoprotein metabolism and adiposity.<br>
In carrying out the procedures of the present invention it is of course to be understood that reference to particular buffers, media, reagents, cells, culture conditions and the like are not intended to be limiting, but are to be read so as to include all related materials that one of ordinary skill in the art would recognize as being of interest or value in the particular context in which that discussion is presented. For example, it is often possible to substitute one buffer system or culture medium for another and still achieve similar, if not identical, results. Those of skill in the art will have sufficient knowledge of such systems and methodologies so as to be able, without undue experimentation, to make such substitutions as will optimally serve their purposes in using the methods and procedures disclosed herein.<br><br>
Pharmaceutical Compositions of the Invention and Administration<br>
The present invention also relates to pharmaceutical composition containing the compounds of the invention disclosed herein. In one embodiment, the present invention relates to a composition comprising compounds of the invention in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and in an amount effective to modulate triglyceride level or to treat diseases related to dyslipidemia and disorders of tipid metabolism, when administered to an animal, preferably a mammal, most preferably a human patient. In an embodiment of such composition, the patient has an elevated lipid level, such as elevated triglycerides or cholesterol, before administration of said compound of the invention and the compound of the invention is present in an amount effective to reduce said lipid level.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions useful herein also contain a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, including any suitable diluent or excipient, which includes any pharmaceutical agent that does not itself induce the production of antibodies harmful to the individual receiving the composition, and which may be administered without undue toxicity. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include, but are not limited to, liquids, such as water, saline, glycerol and ethanol, and the like. A thorough discussion of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, and other excipients is presented in REMINGTON'S PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES (Mack Pub. Co., N.J. current edition).<br>
Those skilled in the art know how to determine suitable doses of the compounds for use in treating the diseases and disorders contemplated herein. Therapeutic doses are generally identified through a dose ranging study in humans based on preliminary evidence derived from animal studies. Doses must be sufficient to result in a desired therapeutic benefit without causing unwanted side-effects for the patient. The preferred dosage range for an animal is 0.001 mg/Kg to 10,000 mg/Kg, including 0.5 mg/Kg, 1.0 mg/Kg and 2.0 mg/Kg, though doses outside this range may be acceptable. The dosing schedule may be once or twice per day, although more often or less often may be satisfactory.<br>
Those skilled in the art are also familiar with determining administration methods (oral, intravenous, inhalation, sub-cutaneous, etc.), dosage forms, suitable pharmaceutical excipients and other matters relevant to the delivery of the compounds to a subject in need thereof.<br>
In an alternative use of the invention, the compounds of the invention can be<br><br>
used in in vitro or in vivo studies as exemplary agents for comparative purposes to find other compounds also useful in treatment of, or protection from, the various diseases disclosed herein.<br>

EXAMPLE 7 MEASURING STEAROYL-COA DESATURASE INHIBITION ACTIVITY OF A TEST COMPOUND USING MOUSE LIVER MICROSOMES. The identification of compounds of the invention as SCD inhibitors was readily accomplished using the SCD enzymes and microsomal assay procedure described in Brownlie ef a/, PCT published patent application, WO 01/62954.<br>
Preparation of Mouse Liver Microsomes:<br>
Male ICR mice, on a high-carbohydrate, low fat diet, under light halothane (15% in mineral oil) anesthesia are sacrificed by exsanguination during periods of high enzyme activity. Livers are immediately rinsed with cold 0.9% NaCI solution, weighed and minced with scissors. All procedures are performed at4°C unless specified otherwise. Livers are homogenized in a solution (1:3 w/v) containing 0.25 M sucrose, 62 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 0.15 M KCI, 1.5 mM A/-acetyleysteine, 5 mM MgCI2, and 0.1 mM EDTA using 4 strokes of a Potter-Elvehjem tissue homogenizer. The homogenate is centrifuged at 10,400 x g for 20 min to eliminate mitochondria and cellular debris. The supernatant is filtered through a 3-layer cheesecloth and centrifuged at 105,000 x g for 60 min. The microsomal pellet is gently resuspended in the same homogenization solution with a small glass/teflon homogenizer and stored at -70°C. The absence of mitochondrial contamination is enzymatically assessed. The protein concentration is measured using bovine serum albumin as the standard.<br><br>
Incubation of Mouse Liver Microsomes with Test Compounds:<br>
Reactions are started by adding 2 mg of microsomal protein to pre-incubated tubes containing 0.20 jiCi of the substrate fatty acid (1-14C palmitic acid) at a final concentration of 33.3 ^M in 1.5 ml of homogenization solution, containing 42 mM NaF, 0.33 mM niacinamide, 1.6 mM ATP, 1.0 mM NADH, 0.1 mM coenzyme A and a 10 \iM concentration of test compound. The tubes are vortexed vigorously and after 15 min incubation in a shaking water bath (37 °C), the reactions are stopped and fatty acids are analyzed.<br>
Fatty acids are analyzed as follows: The reaction mixture is saponified with 10% KOH to obtain free fatty acids which are further methylated using BF3 in methanol. The fatty acid methyl esters are analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a Hewlett Packard 1090, Series II chromatograph equipped with a diode array detector set at 205 nm, a radioisotope detector (Model 171, Beckman, CA) with a solid scintillation cartridge (97% efficiency for uC-detection) and a reverse-phase ODS (C-18) Beckman column (250 mm x 4.6 mm i.d.; 5 ^m particle size) attached to a pre-column with a ^Bondapak C-18 (Beckman) insert. Fatty acid methyl esters are separated isocratically with acetonitrile/water (95:5 v:v) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min and are identified by comparison with authentic standards. Alternatively, fatty acid methyl esters may be analyzed by capillary column gas-chromatography (GC) or Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC).<br>
