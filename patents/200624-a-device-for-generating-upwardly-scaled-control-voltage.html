				<td>Background of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to the field of synchronizing oscillators, and in particular, to a phase locked loop having a phase detector for generating upwardly scaled control voltages.<br>
Many voltage controlled oscillators (VCO), particularly crystal oscillators (VCXO), are controlled by varactors.  A varactor can be described as a reverse biased diode that exhibits a capacitance dependent upon the magnitude of the reverse bias voltage applied to it.  The resonant frequency of the oscillator can be controlled by the bias voltage. Insufficient bias voltage to attain a given operating frequency or range of frequencies can present a serious problem.  This situation is illustrated in Figure 6, which shows a phase locked loop.  A phase detector 56 has the output of a horizontal oscillator and a horizontal synchronizing components as respective inputs.  Current flows between the output of the phase detector and an integrator 58, often formed by two capacitors and resistor as shown.<br>
Varactors 62 control a voltage controlled oscillator 64. The varactors require, for example, a bias voltage up to +15 volts DC, but the control voltage developed by the integrator 58 is too small.  Accordingly, an operational amplifier 60 is interposed between the integrator 58 and the varactors 62 to scale up, that is, to increase the magnitude of the control voltage to 15 volts, the supply voltage for the operational amplifier.  The need for a separate sealer increases the complexity and cost of the phase locked loop, and moreover, requires that the design of each phase locked loop be re-engineered.<br>
There is a long-felt need for a phase detector that can directly supply control voltages at a variety of voltages and/or over different ranges of voltages.  Moreover, there is<br>
-1-<br><br>
a long-felt need to provide a phase locked loop that can utilize such a phase detector in a simplified, less expensive arrangement that can easily be modified to accommodate different desired voltages and ranges of voltages.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
In accordance with the inventive arrangements the output of a phase detector can advantageously directly generate the range of voltage required for the VCO or VCXO varactors.<br>
A phase locked loop in accordance with the inventive arrangements comprises:  means requiring a control signal having a given bias voltage for generating a clock signal; an integrator for developing the control signal; a source of an external synchronizing signal; first and second voltage sources defining a voltage potential related to the given bias voltage; a first switch coupled to the first and second voltage sources and responsive to the clock signal for developing a regenerated clock signal having a peak to peak voltage determined by the voltage potential; and, a second switch responsive to the external synchronizing signal for periodically sampling portions of the regenerated clock signal and coupling the sampled portions to the to the integrator, the sampled portions charging and discharging the integrator to generate the control voltage with a large enough magnitude to provide the given bias voltage, whereby the.clock signal generating means is synchronized to the external synchronizing signal.<br>
The phase locked loop can advantageously further comprise:  the integrator developing a first control voltage; a source of a second control voltage; a third switch defining a first switchable path between the integrator and the clock signal generating means, and defining a second switchable path between the source of the second control voltage and the integrator, the first or the second switchable path being closed responsive to a control voltage source selection<br>
-2-<br><br>
signal.  The first control voltage can be coupled to the clock signal generating means for a phase locked mode of operation and the second control voltage can be coupled to the clock signal generating means for a phase unlocked mode of operation.<br>
The first, second and third switches can advantageously be analog semiconductor switches, and further, can advantageously be embodied in an integrated circuit. Drawings <br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments A phase detector with the added functionality of a voltage sealer, in accordance with the inventive arrangements, satisfies the long-felt needs of the prior art to improve and simplify the design of phase locked loops.  The need for a separate voltage sealer is ended.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a phase locked loop 10 for synchronizing a voltage controlled oscillator to the horizontal synchronizing component of a video signal, utilizing a phase detector in accordance with the inventive arrangements.  A voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) or<br>
-3-<br><br>
voltage controlled crystal oscillator (VCXO) 20 is controlled by varactors 50.  The varactors require a certain voltage or voltage range to assure that the oscillator can attain a desired operational frequency.  In this case, the voltage required by the varactors is +15 volts DC.  The varactors 50 are controlled by a control voltage developed by an integrator 16.  The integrator 16 is charged and discharged by the output current of a phase detector 14, comprising a plurality of analog switches.  The term analog switch is intended to include, for example, semiconductor switches of the kind that can be embodied in an integrated circuit.  An example of a suitable integrated circuit is a multiple analog switch integrated circuit, for example a CD4053B analog multiplexer Ul or its equivalent.  The phase detector has a first input for receiving the output of the oscillator.  The input is the control pin for switch A.  In order to assure proper operation of the switch, the horizontal oscillator output signal switches a transistor Ql on and off and the transistor Ql operates the switch.  The phase detector has a second input for receiving a horizontal synchronizing component of a video signal.  The input is the control pin for switch B.  In order to assure proper operation of the switch, the horizontal oscillator output signal switches a transistor Ql on and off and the transistor Ql operates the switch.<br>
It will be assumed for purposes of illustration in Figure 1 that the oscillator and the horizontal synchronizing component both have a nominal frequency of lfH, approximately 15.735 KHz in the NTSC system.  It will also be assumed, as is often the case, that a prior art phase detector cannot directly generate a control voltage as large as +15 volts DC.<br>
The input contacts of switch A, pins 12 and 13, are coupled to ground and +15 volts respectively.  The common contact of switch A, pin 14, is alternately coupled to pins 12 and 13, and in turn to ground and + 15 volts DC respectively.<br>
-4-<br><br>
Switch A is controlled responsive to the horizontal oscillator output signal acting through transistor Ql, applied to pin 11. The voltage at pin 15 is illustrated by the uppermost waveform in Figure 2. The common contact of switch A, pin 14, is coupled to the common contact of switch B, pin 15, as an input signal.<br>
Switch B is controlled by transistor Q4 responsive to the horizontal synchronizing component, applied to pin 10.  The voltage at pin 15 is illustrated by the uppermost waveform in Figure 2.  One output contact of switch B, pin 1, is coupled to the phase detector filter 16, embodied by capacitors C16 and C17 and resistor R18.  The other output contact of switch B, pin 2, is open.  The voltage at pin 10 is illustrated by the middle waveform in Figure 2.<br>
The current through resistor R17, and pin 1, is illustrated by the lower waveform in Figure 2.  When the voltages at pins 10 and 15 are both positive, the charge and discharge current is positive.  When the voltage at pin 10 is positive and the voltage at pin 15 is negative, the charge and discharge current is negative.  When the pulses of the horizontal synchronizing component occur, the integrator is charged or discharged.  When the horizontal synchronizing component pulses do not occur, the input to the integrator floats.  The magnitudes of the phase detector filter charge and discharge currents are primarily determined by the value of resistor R17, presently 20K.  In the phase-locked condition the average value of the charge and discharge currents are equal.  It can be seen from Figure 2 that the synchronizing signal on pin 10 samples every pulse of the oscillator signal on pin 15, thus causing the positive and negative currents at resistor Rl7/pin 1.  The integrated current at pin 1 need not be scaled up in magnitude to drive the varactors of a VCO or VCXO because the necessary bias voltage is advantageously provided by the potential across pins 12 and 13.<br>
-5-<br><br>
The sampling action of the phase detector suggests a useful alternative for describing the phase locked loop.  A means for requiring a control signal having a given bias voltage for generating a clock signal can be embodied as the varactor and the controllable oscillator.  The integrator develops the control signal.  A source of an external synchronizing signal need not necessarily be a horizontal synchronizing component.  The phase detector can be embodied as first and second switches.  First and second voltage sources, for example ground and + 15 volts DC, define a voltage potential related to the given bias voltage.  The first switch is coupled to the first and second voltage sources and is responsive to the clock signal for developing a regenerated clock signal having a peak to peak voltage determined by the voltage potential.  The second switch is responsive to the external synchronizing signal for periodically sampling portions of the regenerated clock signal and coupling the sampled portions to the to the integrator. The sampled portions, for example charge and discharge the integrator to generate the control voltage with a large enough magnitude to provide the given bias voltage.  The phase detector formed by the first and second switches synchronizes the clock signal generating means to the external synchronizing signal.<br>
The phase detector explained in connection with Figures 1 and 2 can be advantageously utilized in a multiple frequency horizontal synchronizing system, as shown in Figure 3.  The system 100 has selectable modes of operation including an open loop and a closed loop control path for an oscillator 20. Oscillator 20 can, for example, be a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) or a voltage controlled crystal oscillator (VCXO).  The oscillator is controlled by varactors 50.  Open loop control is used for displaying digital video signals, for example in MPEG2 format.  The oscillator 20 operates at 13.5<br>
-6-<br><br>
MHz, which is then doubled to 27 MHz and used as the reference for an 81 MHz pixel display clock and the MPEG2 system clock.<br>
The open loop control path begins with a microprocessor ((IP) 26 that supplies a digital frequency control value to a binary rate multiplier (BRM) over a data bus 40.  The digital frequency control value is converted to an MPEG2 system clock control voltage by a BRM filter 24.  The output of BRM filter 24 on line 25 is a first input to a filter source switch 18. The MPEG2 system clock control voltage is supplied to the oscillator 20 from filter source switch 18 responsive to a 2fH / 2.14£H selection signal generated by the microprocessor 27. The BRM filter input represents the control signal used for 2.14fH deflection.  The selection signal is illustrated as a direct wire connection, but selection control can also be implemented by the data bus 4 0 or by a serial data and control bus of the kind having SDA and SCL signals, not shown.<br>
A clock generation and counters circuit 28 is responsive to the output of the oscillator 20.  A raster generator is responsive to the clock generation and counters circuit 30, and in turn, drives a display circuit 36.  The display circuit generates a 2.14fH drive signal.  In the presently preferred embodiment, circuits 28, 30 and 36 are embodied in an Sti7000 integrated circuit available from ST Microelectronics.<br>
The closed loop path includes a phase detector 14.  A standard ifH analog video signal, for example NTSC, PAL or SECAM, is an input to a digitizer and synchronizing signal separator 12.  A IfH synchronizing signal is a first input to the phase detector 14.  The drive signal generated by the display circuit 3 6 is fed back as a second input to the phase detector 14.  The feedback path includes a branch point 42 that illustrates three different embodiments.  In one embodiment path 44 leads directly to the phase detector without any modification of the drive signal.  In the phase<br>
detector, the external synchronizing signal samples a fraction<br>
-7-<br><br>
of pulses in the drive signal.  The fraction is related to the ratio of the first and second frequencies.  In this case, the phase detector compares the phase of every lfH synchronizing pulse with every other pulse of the 2fH drive signal.  If the second frequency is 3fH, for example, the external synchronizing signal samples every third pulse in the regenerated clock signal.  In the case of a IfH input video signal, the drive signal will have a frequency of 2fH.  In a second embodiment represented by pulse width stretch circuit 46, the drive pulses are stretched, for example from a width of approximately 1 (isec to approximately 9 (isec.  In a third embodiment represented by divider circuit 48, the drive signal is divided by two.  The embodiments represented by circuits 46 and 48 enable the resulting phase locked loop to operate with a faster response time than when direct path 44 is utilized.<br>
The output of the phase detector is integrated by a phase detector filter 16.  The integrated output is a phase lock control voltage supplied as a second input to filter source switch 18 over line 17.  The phase detector filter input represents the control signal used for 2fH deflection.<br>
The analog video that has been processed by digitizer 12 is supplied on lines 15 to a lfH to 2fH upconversion circuit 32.  The upconversion can be accomplished by doubling the number of horizontal lines, as the digitized video is read out from a memory 34.  Alternatively, the upconversion can be accomplished by interpolation.  The upconverted video signal is read from the memory 34 into the display circuit 36, and then supplied as a video output signal (VIDEO OUT).  The upconversion circuit 32 can also be a part of the Sti7000 integrated circuit.<br>
During operation at 2.14fH there will be a 2.14fH input to the phase detector 14, and there may be a lfH synchronizing signal also applied to the phase detector 14,even if the lfH<br>
signal is not selected for display.  However, the filter<br>
-8-<br><br>
source switch will at that time be supplying the MPEG2 system clock control voltage to the oscillator and the output of the phase detector 14, if any, will be effectively ignored.<br>
When the system supplies the 2fH drive signal instead of the 2.14fH drive signal the oscillator operates at the same clock frequency.  Instead of changing the oscillator frequency, the operation of the clock generation and counters circuit 28 is modified to change the number of samples during blanking.  The significant difference is that the 2fH drive signal and the lfH input signal are phase locked.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates a circuit schematic for implementing various parts of the system 100 shown in Figure 3.  This embodiment advantageously utilizes the phase detector shown in Figure 1, thus reducing the number of components by having the output of the phase detector directly generate the range of 0 to 15 volts required for the VCXO varactors.  Moreover, the filter source switch 18 can also be advantageously embodied in the analog multiplexer embodying the phase detector.<br>
The phase detector 14 and the integrator filter 16 are connected as explained in connection with Figure 1, with the following exceptions.  The integrated control voltage is coupled to one input contact of switch C, pin 3.  The other input contact of switch C, pin 5, is coupled to the MPEG2 system clock control voltage from BRM filter 24.  Switch C is controlled by transistor Q5, responsive to the 2fH / 2.14fH control signal form the (IP 26.  Switch C, advantageously part of Ul, acts as filter source switch 18.  The 2fH drive signal is an input to a pulse width stretch circuit 46 embodied as a component one-shot circuit formed by transistors Q2 and Q3. The values of resistors RIO, Rll, R12,- R13 and R14 are chosen to provide an approximately 9 p,sec output pulse responsive to an approximately 1 Usec input pulse.  The stretched pulse is an input to the control pin 11, for operating switch A.<br>
-9-<br><br>
Switch A is switched between +15 volts on pin -13 and ground on pin 12 at a 2fH rate based on the deflection. Switch B is controlled by transistor Q4 responsive to the ifH synchronizing component.  Switch C switches the voltage applied to the VCXO varactors between the phase detector output for. IfH video signal upconversion operation and the BRK output used in normal MPEG2 decoding.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates the voltage at pin 15, the voltage at pin 10 and the current at through resistor R17, which is also the current at pin 1.  It can be seen that the IfH- signal on pin 10 samples every other pulse of the 2fH signal on pin 15, thus causing the positive and negative currents at resistor R17/pin 1.  The integrated current at pin 3 need not be scaled to drive the varactors of a VCO or VCXO.<br>
It will- be appreciated that, the phase detector-taught herein can be used in phase locked loops to synchronize an oscillator to external synchronizing signals other than horizontal synchronizing components in video signals.<br>
