[Title of the Invention] Transmission for Internal Combustion Engine Use [Technical Field] [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a transmission for internal combustion engine use to be mounted on a motorcycle. [Background Art] [0002]<br>
Fig. 11 is a sectional view of a conventional transmission configured integrally with an internal combustion engine for motorcycle use. Underneath a crankshaft not shown, the input shaft 021 and the output shaft 022 of the transmission are disposed in parallel to the crankshaft. The input shaft 021 is rotatably supported by a left crank case 001 and a right crank case 002 each via a bearing. The output shaft 022 is rotatably supported by a left crank case cover 003 and the right crank case 002. The input shaft 021 is driven by the crankshaft via a primary reduction gear and a clutch. A wheel (not shown) is directly fitted to the left end of the output shaft 022. [0003]<br>
Four driving gears ml through m4 are fitted to the input shaft 021 in the order of the diameter size, every one of them being fixed to the input shaft. These are a first speed driving gear through a fourth speed driving gear. Four driven gears cl through c4 always in mesh with the four gears ml through m4 of the input shaft are loosely fitted to the output shaft 022 to be freely rotatable relative to the output shaft 022. These are a first speed driven gear through a fourth speed driven gear.<br>
[4]	<br>
In the central part of the major diameter part 002a of the output shaft 022 to which the gears cl through c4 are loosely fitted, there is bored a center hole 030 open at one end, and in a thick-wall cylindrical part 031 around it there are cut at equal intervals four slits 032 in the axial direction, establishing communication between the center hole 030 and the outside peripheral part of the thick-wall cylindrical part 031. A cross-sectional slit is formed by the center hole 030 and the four slits 032.<br>
[5]	<br>
Every one of the center penetrating holes in the gears cl through c4 fitted to the major diameter part 002a of the output shaft 022 is formed in the same concave or convex shape. Plural inward protrusions kl through k4 constitute engaging parts 033 to engage with a cross-shaped pawl 036 to be described afterwards, and their inner ends constitute a sliding portion 033a which is in contact with the outer circumference of the output shaft major diameter part 002a and slides in the circumferential direction. A portion kn where there is no engaging part is the neutral position of the cross-shaped pawl 036. The concave portion between adjoining engaging parts 033 is a pawl tip moving space 034, a space in which the tip of the cross-shaped pawl is to move in the axial direction as will be described afterwards.<br>
[0006]<br>
The cross-sectional slit consisting of the center hole 030 and the axial direction slits 032 is fitted with a pawl coupling shaft 035 and the cross-shaped pawl (gear arresting pawl) 036 fitted to its tip to be slidable in the axial direction (see Patent Document 1 for instance) . A guide pipe 037 is fitted in the space between the pawl coupling shaft 035 and the center hole 030. The guide pipe 037 slides together with the pawl coupling shaft 035 and the cross-shaped pawl 036 in the axial direction. When the rider moves the pawl coupling shaft 035 via a rotary motion-to-linear motion converting device 050 to be described afterwards, engages the tip of the cross-shaped pawl 036 fitted to the tip of the pawl coupling shaft 035 with the engaging part 033 of any one of the gears cl through c4 and arrests the free rotation of that gear relative to the output shaft 022, that gear is selected. A shift is thereby accomplished according to the gear ratio between the gear arrested by the output shaft 022 and a fixed gear on the input shaft 021 side meshing with it, and the rotation of the crankshaft is transmitted to the output shaft 022 via the input shaft 021 to drive a wheel. A convexo-concave part 056 is formed on part of the outer circumference of the guide pipe 037. A steel ball 057 is pressed from the major diameter part 002a against this convexo-concave part 056 by a coil spring 058. This is a device to apply a spring force so as to place the<br>
cross-shaped pawl 036 in the normal position of each speed stage.<br>
[7]	<br>
The rotary motion-to-linear motion converting device 050 is shown at the right end of Fig. 11. This device is disposed between the right crank case 002 and a rotary motion-to-linear motion converting device cover 051. In the central part of the rotary motion-to-linear motion converting device cover 051 is a center shaft 052 rotatably supported by the cover. An arm member 053 is fixed to this center shaft 052, and an engaging piece 054 sliding in contact with the pawl coupling shaft 035 is rotatably fitted to the tip of the arm member 053 via a supporting shaft 055. A pulley 080 is fixed to the center shaft 052; an up-side wire 071 and a down-side wire 072 are fitted along the periphery of the circular groove of the pulley 080; and one end of each wire is fixed to the pulley 080. The other ends of the up-side wire 071 and the down-side wire 072 are connected to the rotational control unit (not shown) fitted to the handlebar.<br>
[8]	<br>
When a shift from the first speed gear to the top (fourth speed in this example) gear is to be done, the rotational control unit fitted to the handlebar of the vehicle has to be turned by a large degree.<br>
[0009]<br>
[Patent Document 1] JP-A No. 70747/1993 [Disclosure of the Invention]<br>
[Problem to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
[0010]<br>
In the conventional transmission, when a shift from the first speed gear to the top gear is to be done, the rotational control unit fitted to the handlebar of the vehicle has to be turned by a wide angle, and this imposes an undue load on the vehicle rider's fingers. The present invention, with a view to imposing no undue load on the vehicle rider' s fingers, provides means to enable, where four-step shifting from the first speed gear to the fifth speed gear is to be done for instance, the shifting from the first speed gear to the fifth speed gear to be accomplished by taking four times repetitively a narrow angle turning action for one-step shifting. [Means for Solving the Problem]<br>

[Effects of the Invention]<br>
[13]	<br>
According to the invention, the rotational control unit fitted to the handlebar of the vehicle enables multi-step shifting to be accomplished by repeating a narrow angle turning action plural times.<br>
[Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention]<br>
[14]	<br>
Fig. 1 shows a sectional development view of a four-stroke cycle internal combustion engine for motorcycle use pertaining to one mode for carrying out the present invention including each rotation axis, the section representing a view of the internal combustion engine in a state of being mounted on a vehicle. In the drawing, the outer shell of this internal combustion engine is configured of a left crank case 1, right crank case 2, left crank case cover 3, right crank case cover 4, cylinder block 5, cylinder head 6 and cylinder head cover 7. A crankshaft 8 consists of left and right portions, integrated by a crank pin 9. The crankshaft 8 is rotatably supported by the left crank case 1 and the right crank case 2 via main bearings 10 and 11, respectively. A piston 13 is connected to the crank pin 9 via a connecting rod 13, and the piston 13 reciprocates within the cylinder block 5 in the direction of the cylinder axis. A combustion chamber 14 is formed underneath the cylinder head 6. The cylinder head 6 is fitted with an ignition plug 15, whose tip overlooks the combustion chamber 14. Within the cylinder head 6, the camshaft 16 of a valve train is rotatably supported.<br>
[0015]<br>
On the left side of the internal combustion engine assembled as described above, there is disposed a cam chain chamber 17 penetrating from the left end space of the camshaft 16 to the left end space of the crankshaft 8. A driving sprocket 18 is snapped onto the left portion of the crankshaft 8, a driven sprocket 19 is fixed to the left end of the camshaft 16, and a cam chain 20 spans these two sprockets. In this way, the rotational driving force of the crankshaft 8 is transmitted to the camshaft 16, and a cam formed on the camshaft 16 can drive intake and exhaust valves arranged in the cylinder head 6 at a prescribed timing.<br>
[0016]<br>
An ACG (AC generator) 40 is disposed at the right end of the crankshaft 8. The ACG 40 is configured of a stator 41 fixed to the right crank case 2 and a rotor 42 which is fixed to the crankshaft 8 and rotates on the outer circumference of the stator along with the rotation of the crankshaft 8. A centrifugal fan 43 is fitted to the right side of the rotor 42 and turns together with the rotor 42. An air flow coming in through many air inlet small holes 44 bored in the right crank case cover 4 and stirred up by the centrifugal fan 43 circulates inside the right crank case cover 4 to cool the cylinder block 5 and the cylinder head 6.<br>
[0017]<br>
The input shaft 21 and the output shaft 22 of the transmission are disposed underneath the crankshaft. The input shaft 21 is rotatably supported by the left crank case 1 and the right crank case 2, each via a bearing. The output shaft 22 is rotatably supported by the left crank case cover 3 and the right crank case 2, each via a bearing. A primary reduction driving gear 23 is fixed to the left end of the crankshaft 8, and a primary reduction driven gear 24 to mesh with the driving gear 23 is rotatably disposed at the left end of the input shaft 21. The primary reduction driven gear 24 is connected to the clutch outer 26 of a clutch 25, and the clutch inner 27 of the clutch 25 is fixed to the input shaft 21. The output shaft 22 is the output shaft of this internal combustion engine, and a wheel 28 is directly fitted to the left end of the output shaft 22.<br>
[0018]<br>
Five driving gears Ml through M5 are disposed on the input shaft 21 in the order of the diameter size, every one of them being fixed to the input shaft 21. They are the first speed driving gear through the fifth speed driving gear. Five driven gears Cl through C5 which are always in mesh with the five gears Ml through M5 of the input shaft 21 are loosely fitted to the output shaft 22 to be freely rotatable relative to the output shaft 22. These are the first speed driven gear through the fifth speed driven gear.<br>
[19]	<br>
Fig. 2 is an expanded sectional view of the major diameter part 22a of the output shaft 22 to which the gears Cl through C5 are loosely fitted. A center hole 30 open at one end is bored, and in a thick-wall cylindrical part 31 around it there are cut at equal intervals four slits 32 in the axial direction, establishing communication between the center hole 30 and the outside peripheral part of the thick-wall cylindrical part 31. A cross-sectional slit is formed by the center hole 30 and the four slits 32.<br>
[20]	<br>
Fig. 3 shows a section of the central part, in the thickness direction, of the gear CI as a representative example of the loosely fitted gears CI through C5 . The center penetrating hole in the gear CI is formed convexo-concavely. Plural inward protrusions constitute engaging parts 33 to engage with the cross-shaped pawl to be described afterwards, and their inner ends constitute a sliding portion 33a which is in contact with the outer circumference of the output shaft major diameter part 22a and slides in the circumferential direction. The concave portion between adjoining engaging parts 33 is a pawl tip moving space 34, a space in which the tip of the pawl is to move in the axial direction as will be described afterwards. The shape of the inner edges of the center penetrating holes in the loosely fitted gears C2 through C5 are the same as that of the inner edge of the center penetrating hole in the gear CI mentioned above.<br>
[0021]<br>
The cross-sectional slit consisting of the center hole 30 and the axial direction slits 32 is fitted with a pawl coupling shaft 35 and the cross-shaped pawl (gear arresting pawl) 36 fitted to its tip to be slidable in the axial direction. When the rider moves the pawl coupling shaft 35 via a rotary motion-to-linear motion converting device 50 to be described afterwards, engages the tip of the cross-shaped pawl 36 fitted to the tip of the pawl coupling shaft 35 with the engaging part 33 of any one of the gears CI through C5 and arrests the free rotation of that gear relative to the output shaft 22, that gear is selected. A shift is thereby accomplished according to the gear ratio between the gear Cx arrested by the output shaft 22 in this process and a fixed gear Mx out of the gears Ml through M5 on the input shaft 21 side meshing with it, and the rotation of the crankshaft is transmitted to the output shaft 22 via the input shaft 01 to drive the wheel 28.<br>
[0022]<br>
Fig. 4 shows the group of gears Cl through C5 fitted to the major diameter part 22a and the rotary motion-to-linear motion converting device 50 consecutive to it. Fig. 5 shows a V-V section of Fig. 4. First in the left half of Fig. 4, the five driven gears Cl through C5 are loosely fitted to the major diameter part 22a of the output shaft 22 as described above. They are respectively the first speed driven gear through the fifth speed driven gear. Within the gears, the engaging parts 33 of K1 through K5 are provided matching Cl through C5, respectively. A neutral portion Kn where there is no engaging part 33 is disposed in the first speed driven gear Cl. In Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, the pawl coupling shaft 35 and the cross-shaped pawl 36 fitted to its tip are fitted to the cross-sectional slit consisting of the center hole 30 and the axial direction slits 32 to be slidable in the axial direction. A guide pipe 37 is fitted between the pawl coupling shaft 35 and the inner face of the center hole 30. The guide pipe 37 moves in the axial direction together with the pawl coupling shaft 35. When the rider moves the pawl coupling shaft 35 in the axial direction via the rotary motion-to-linear motion converting device 50, engages the tip of the cross-shaped pawl 36 with the engaging part K1 ... or K5 of any one of the gears CI through C5 and arrests the free rotation of that gear relative to the output shaft 22, a shift (to one of the first speed through the fifth speed) is accomplished according to the gear ratio between that gear and a fixed gear on the input shaft 21 side meshing with it. When the pawl is in the Kn position, it is a neutral state. Fig. 4 shows the neutral state.<br>
[23]	<br>
Fig. 6 is a sectional view of the rotary motion-to-linear motion converting device 50 shown in the right half of Fig. 4, mainly showing a VI-VI section of Fig. 4. For some member, in order to clearly show its shape, another section than the VI-VI section is shown. This device is disposed between the right crank case 2 and a rotary motion-to-linear motion converting device cover 51.<br>
[24]	<br>
In the central part of the rotary motion-to-linear motion converting device cover 51 is a center shaft 52 rotatably supported by the cover. An arm member 53 is fixed to this center shaft 52 in the deepest inside as shown in Fig. 4 or on the right side as shown in Fig. 6. A ratchet 59 is fixed to the center shaft 52 on the foremost side as shown in Fig. 4 or at the left end as shown in Fig. 6. Therefore, when the ratchet 59 turns, the arm member 53 is turned via the center shaft 52. An engaging piece 54, sliding in contact with the pawl coupling shaft 35, is rotatably fitted via a supporting shaft 55. The lower part of the arm member 53 expands in a fan shape, and a convexo-concave part 56 is formed around it. A steel ball 57 is pressed from the major rotary motion-to-linear motion converting device cover 51 side against this convexo-concave part 56 by a coil spring 58. This is a device to apply a spring force so as to place the cross-shaped pawl 36 in the normal position of each speed stage (the central position, in the axial direction, of the engaging part 33 of each gear).<br>
[25]	<br>
Behind the ratchet in Fig. 4, a shift plate 60 is rotatably fitted to the center shaft 52. A large through hole 61 is bored in the upper half of the shift plate 60; a stopper boss 62 protruding from the rotary motion-to-linear motion converting device cover 51 behind penetrates the through hole 61, and protrudes before the shift plate 60. An engaging stub 63 is formed on the shift plate 60 by bending forward a part of the circumference of the through hole 61. A torsion coil spring 64 for return use is fitted between the ratchet 59 and the shift plate 60 onto the center shaft 52, and two legs extending from the two ends of the coil spring 64 have the stopper boss 62 and the engaging stub 63 between them.<br>
[26]	<br>
A left side pawl member 65 and a right side pawl member 66 are rotatably fitted by supporting shafts 67 and 68 to the left and right sides, respectively, of the lower part of the shift plate 60. The pawl members 65 and 66 are provided with pawls 65a and 66a on the side opposite the ratchet 59. Torsion coil springs 69 and 70, spanning the shift plate 60 and the pawl members 65 and 66, respectively, are fitted to the supporting shafts 67 and 68, to apply a spring force not to let the pawls 65a and 66a come into contact with the ratchet 59 except during operation. One end of an up-side wire 71 is fitted to the outside end of the left side pawl member 65, and one end of a down-side wire 72 is fitted to the outside end of the right side pawl member 66. The other ends of the up-side wire 71 and the down-side wire 72 are connected to the rotational control unit fitted to the handlebar of the vehicle.<br>
[27]	<br>
Fig. 4 shows a neutral state, in which the cross-shaped pawl 36 is in the neutral position Kn. Shifting is done intermittently by one step each time. When the cross-shaped pawl 36 has reached the first speed engaging part Kl, the first speed state is achieved. Fig. 7 shows an intermediate state from the neutral state toward the first speed state. Fig. 8 is a diagram showing the position of each member of the rotary motion-to-linear motion converting device 50 when the first speed state has been reached.<br>
[28]	<br>
Next will be described the one-step shifting process of changing from the neutral state to the first speed state.<br>
(1)	In the neutral state of Fig. 4, the rider pulls the up-side wire 71 by manipulating the rotational control unit fitted to the handlebar of the vehicle.<br>
(2)	Then, the left side pawl member 65 turns against the spring force of the torsion coil spring 69, and the pawl 65a engages with the concave of the ratchet 59.<br>
(3)	When the up-side wire 71 is further pulled, the left side pawl member 65 moves upward to cause the engaged ratchet 59 to turn.<br>
(4)	As the ratchet 59 is connected to the arm member 53 via the center shaft 52, the arm member 53 starts turning.<br>
(5)	The steel ball 57 which has been pressed against the concave of the convexo-concave part 56 in the lower part of the arm member 53 begins to ride on the convex of the convexo-concave part 56.<br>
(6)	As the supporting shaft 67 of the left side pawl member 65 is erected on the shift plate 60, the shift plate 60, together with the ratchet 59 and the arm member 53, turns by the same angle along with the upward movement of the left side pawl member 65.<br>
(7)	Along with the turning of the arm member 53, pulled by the engaging piece 54 at its tip, the pawl coupling shaft 35, the cross-shaped pawl 36 and the guide pipe 37 move in the axial direction.<br>
(8)	The steel ball 57 having ridden on the convex of the convexo-concave part 56 in the lower part of the arm member 53 begins to descend after reaching the peak, and enters into the adjoining concave.<br>
(9)	As the turning of the shift plate 60 advances and one edge of the inner circumference of the through hole 61 comes into contact with the stopper boss 62, the turning of the shift plate 60 and so forth stops, resulting in the state of Fig. 7. Then, the two legs of the torsion coil spring 64 for return use are expanded to the maximum by the stopper boss 62 and the engaging stub 63.<br>
(10)	In this state, though the cross-shaped pawl 36 is catching the first speed engaging part K1 of the gear, it is in a position slightly ahead of the first speed engaging part Kl. The steel ball 57 is also in a position slightly ahead of the first speed engaging part Kl. The up-side wire 71 is relieved of tension in this state.<br>
(11)	When the up-side wire 71 is relieved of tension, the engagement between the pawl 65a of the left side pawl member 65 and the concave of the ratchet 59 is released by the spring force of the torsion coil spring 69 working on the left side pawl member 65.<br>
(12)	As the release of the tension of the up-side wire 71 makes further progress, the shift plate 60, the pawl members 65 and 66 erected on it and so forth are returned to their original positions by the action of the torsion coil spring 64 for return use generating an elastic force between the stopper boss 62 and the engaging stub 63 of the shift plate 60.<br>
(13)	As the engagement between the pawl 65a of the pawl member 65 and the concave of the ratchet 59 is already released by then, even though the pawl member 65 returns to its original position, the ratchet 59 and the arm member 53 are not interlocked with it but remains in their turned positions.<br>
(14)	As the steel ball 57 is pressed against the deepest part of the concave matching the first speed in the convexo-concave part 56 of the arm member 53, the arm member 53, the pawl coupling shaft 35, the cross-shaped pawl 36 and the guide pipe 37 slightly recede and settle down in the normal first speed position. Fig. 8 shows the first speed state reached by the one-step shifting process.<br>
[29]	<br>
While the one-step up-shifting process from the neutral state to the first speed state has been described so far, the other up-shifting processes are similar. By performing repetitively these one-step up-shifting processes plural times, a high speed state of, for instance the fifth speed state, can be reached. The down-shifting process can also be achieved by one step at a time as the rider pulls the down-side wire 72 by manipulating the rotational control unit of the handlebar of the vehicle. A characteristic feature of the above-described transmission consists in that the arm member driving mechanism consisting of the wires 71 and 72, the pawl members 65 and 66, the shift plate 60 and so forth returns to its original position every time a one-step shift is accomplished.<br>
[30]	<br>
Fig. 9 shows the position of each member of the rotary motion-to-linear motion converting device 50 at the third speed, and Fig. 10 shows the position of each member of the rotary motion-to-linear motion converting device 50 at the fifth speed. As the positions of those members at the second speed and the fourth speed can be readily inferred, because the position of each member of the rotary motion-to-linear motion converting device 50 at the first speed is shown in Fig. 8, their illustration is dispensed with. In Fig. 9 and Fig. 10, the shift plate 60, the pawl members 65 and 66 and so forth are in their original positions (the positions when no shifting action is taken), which are the same positions as in Fig. 4 and Fig. 8, and accordingly only the external shapes are shown in simplified illustration in one-dot chain lines. The illustration of the torsion coil spring 64 for return use is also dispensed with as it is in its original position.<br><br>
As hitherto described in detail, in this mode for carrying out the invention, multi-step shifting can be accomplished by repeating a narrow angle turning action plural times with the rotational control unit fitted to the handlebar of the vehicle. [Brief Description of the Drawings]<br>
