The clothing tips of the foremost combing clothings (3) which are adjacent to the front end (V) of the basic body (1) penetrate the fibre tufts (F) to be combed out first and are therefore subjected to a higher amount of wear and tear than the combing clothings (4, 5, 6, 7) which are situated further at the back. That is why the foremost combing clothing (3) is provided with a higher resistance to wear and tear than the combing clothings (4, 5, 6, 7) arranged further to the back of the basic body (1). This reduces the wear in the foremost combing clothing (3) and thus extends the service life of the circular comb segment in an inexpensive manner.</td>

' )  H<br>
A circular comb segment for attachment on a comb cylin-/^,    [, der of a combing machine<br>
The invention relates to a circular comb segment for the attachment on a comb cylinder of a combing machine, with a basic body and with several combing clothings attached behind one another in the circumferential direction on the basic body, with each clothing com¬prising clothing tips which are inclined in the direc¬tion towards the front end of the basic body.<br>
Such a circular comb segment, attached on a continu¬ously rotating comb cylinder of the combing machine, is used in a combing machine to comb out fibre tufts which are held out to the circular comb segment by nippers. In this respect, particularly the clothing tips which are situated adjacent to the front end of the basic body and which penetrate the fibre tuft first are subjected to a certain amount of wear and tear. The attrition of these foremost clothing tips is thus particularly strong, because the fibre tuft which is penetrated first by these tips still comprises at that moment all impurities and neps, and the fibres in the fibre tuft are parallelized to a lower extent than during the penetration of clothing tips situated fur¬ther behind on the basic body. The attrition of the most forward clothing tips gradually leads to a change in the combing process. In the end it is necessary to replace the circular comb segment.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to increase the service life of the aforementioned circular comb segment.<br>
The circular comb segment in accordance with the inven¬tion, with which this object is achieved, is character¬ized in that at least the parts of the most forward<br><br>
combing clothings, which are adjacent to the front end of the basic body, are provid( with a higher resistance to wear than combing clothings situated further behind.<br>
The higher resistance to wear can be achieved for example in such a way that the most forward combing clothing consists of a high-yield-point steel and/or is surface-tempered or coated.<br>
The efforts and cost for an increase of the wear resistance for combing clothings situated further back on the basic body are not justified, because the attrition here, as was already mentioned, is lower in any case.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a circular comb segment for attachment on a comb cylinder of a combing machine, with a basic body and with several combing clothings which are attached successively behind one another on the basic body in the circumferential direction, with each clothing comprising clothing tips which are inclined in the direction towards the front end of the basic body, characterized in that at least parts of the foremost combing clothings adjacent to the front end of the basic body are provided with a higher wear resistance than the combing clothings disposed further at the back.<br>
The drawing shows an embodiment of the invention. The drawing shows a schematic vertical sectional view through a circular comb segment attached to a comb cylinder of a combing machine.<br>
The circular comb segment shown in the drawing comprises a basic body 1 which is attached to a comb cylinder 2 of a combing machine by way of fastening screws (not shown). During the operation the comb cylinder 2 is rotated continuously clockwise about its axle according to the drawing. On the outer circumferential surface of the basic body 1 which has the shape of cylinder segments there are attached five combing clothings 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 successively behind one another in the circumferential direction. They are tightly glued on, for example. The combing clothings are provided with clothing tips which are inclined in respect of the radial directions in the direction towards the front end V of the basic body 1.<br><br>
A fibre tuft F to be combed out is presented to the rotating circular comb segment by nippers 8. The cloth¬ing tips of the foremost combing clothing 3 which is adjacent to the front end V of the basic body 1 pene¬trate at first the fibre tufts F to be combed out successively during the operation of the combing ma¬chine. As the fibres in the fibre tuft are still rela¬tively unarranged and the fibre tuft still contains all impurities and neps, the clothing tips of the foremost combing clothing 3 are subjected to a comparably high amount of attrition. That is why in accordance with the invention at least parts of the foremost combing cloth¬ing 3, e.g. the clothing tips, are arranged in such a way that they are provided with a higher resistance to wear than the combing clothings situated further away from the front end of the basic body 1. All combing clothings 4, 5, 6, 7, with the exception of the fore¬most clothing 3, consist evenly of steel, for example. The foremost combing clothing 3 can then consist of highly wear-resistant steel or be surface-tempered or be provided with a wear-resistant coating.<br>
It is advantageous if the combing clothings 4 to 7 are attached on the basic body 1 with a detachable fixing (not shown) . In this way it is possible to replace individual clothings depending on the wear and tear.<br><br><br>
WE CLAIM<br>

circumferential direction, with each clothing comprising clothing tips which are<br>
inclined in the direction towards the front end (V) of the basic body (1), characterized<br>
in that at least parts of the foremost combing clothings (3) adjacent to the front end<br>
(V) of the basic body (1) are provided with a higher wear resistance than the combing<br>
clothings (4, 5, 6, 7) disposed further at the back.<br>
2.	The circular comb segment as claimed in claim 1, wherein the foremost<br>
combing clothing (3) consists of highly wear-resistant steel.<br>
3.	The circular comb segment as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the foremost<br>
combing clothing (3) is surface-tempered.<br>
4.	The circular comb segment as claimed in claim 1, wherein the foremost<br>
combing clothing (3) is provided with a wear-resistant coating.<br>
5.	The circular comb segment as claimed in any one of the claims 1 to 4, wherein<br>
at least one of the combing clothings is attached in a detachable manner on the basic<br>
body.<br>
6.	A circular comb segment for attachment on a comb cylinder of a combing<br>
/    machine,  substantially as herein described with reference to the accompanying<br>
drawings. <br></td>
