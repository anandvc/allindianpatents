UNIVERSITY    OF    LEEDS,    Clarendon    Road, Leeds, LS2 9JT, U.K.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
WO 2006/136785	PCT/GB2006/002147<br>
Electrode<br>
The present invention relates to an electrode composed of an Al-M-Cu based alloy, to a process for preparing the Al-M-Cu based alloy, to an electrolytic cell comprising the electrode, to the use of an Al-M-Cu based alloy as an anode and to a method for extracting a reactive metal from a reactive metal-containing source using an Al-M-Cu based alloy as an anode.<br>
Aluminium metal is produced via the electrochemical dissociation of alumina dissolved in a fluoride melt consisting of A1F3 and NaF known as cryolite (3NaF. AIF3). The cell reaction involves several steps (see F Habashi: A Handbook of Extraction Metallurgy, vol. 3, VCH, Berlin) and relies on the use of carbon anodes and cathodes. To illustrate the need for a consumable carbon anode, a simplified description of the cell reaction is.<br>
½Al203{dissolved) + A C(s) = AI(l) + ±C02<br>
The combustion of carbon is necessary to maintain the temperature of the molten aluminium and cryolite bath which moderates the electrical energy consumption of the cell. In the cell, the power consumption for making aluminium is of the order of 6.3 kWh/kg which is equivalent to 2.1 V and represents 50% of the total energy consumption of the cell. The remaining 50% (or 2.1V) of the total energy consumption maintains the cell temperature in the face of heat losses (and is equivalent to 6.3 kWh/kg for making aluminium metal). For each tonne of aluminium metal produced, 333 kg of carbon is oxidised at the anode to carbon dioxide gas which escapes into the atmosphere. The evolution of carbon dioxide is one of the main sources of greenhouse gas emission in the aluminium industry.<br>
Periodically (eg monthly) the carbon electrode is replaced with a new one. During this change over period, the electrolyte in the bath becomes under saturated and reacts with carbon to produce small concentrations of perfluorocarbon (PFC) gases. Moreover the presence of fluoride salt melt in the Al-electrolytic cell and the large current surge during cell operation lead to decomposition of fluoride salts into reactive forms of fluorine gas which readily react with carbon present in the<br><br>

electrodes to generate PFCs. PFCs also form during anode effect. When the PFCs escape into the atmosphere, they contribute to ozone depletion. PFCs also pose a major health risk to plant workers.<br>
The manufacture of carbon electrodes uses petroleum products which decompose and release hydrocarbon based greenhouse gases. The processing and manufacturing route for electrodes is quite complex and time-consuming. In the lengthy process, the material is prebaked and fired for graphitization at 3000°C for 1 month. A large volume of greenhouse gases (eg methane, sulphur and sulphur dioxide) is emitted during anode fabrication. The costs of energy consumption for a carbon anode is as large as the production metal. Coal tar pitch is used in making Soderberg anodes and during this process S02 forms and contributes to environmental pollution. 11.5 mT of coke for making carbon anodes is consumed globally.<br>
Global aluminium companies have targets to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases and ozone-depleting PFCs. In North America, the major aluminium metal producers have agreed to consider replacing carbon-based electrodes with new non-consumable/inert electrodes.<br>
Most inert electrodes developed to date are based on ceramic powder and cermet-based technologies. ALCOA has successfully demonstrated the use of NiO.Fe2O3-based cermets with a noble metal such as silver and copper for enhancing the electronic conductivity of the cermet electrodes (see US-A-5865980). Since the cermets are made via the ceramic powder fabrication technique, there is apparently a cost implication compared to molten metal melting and casting techniques. Although nickel ferrites have both ionic and electronic conductivities, the major enhancement in the electronic conductivity arises from the presence of the noble metallic phases dispersed in the nickel-ferrite matrix. However the fabrication of ferrite anodes is via ceramic processing and requires firing and sintering above 11000C for several days.<br>
For many years, titanium diboride powders have been used for making ceramic electrodes for producing molten aluminium (see US-A-4929328). The diborides exhibit high-temperature electrical resistivity of 14p. ohm cm and thermal conductivity of 59W m"2 K'1. The sintered materials also exhibit high oxidation and<br><br><br>

PCT/GB2006/002147<br><br>
corrosion resistance. TiB2 has a high melting point and so there is an inherent cost for processing and sintering ceramic powders. Adding alumina in the matrix for reducing the processing and sintering temperatures compromises the conductivity of TiB2 and its composites. The composite can also be fabricated by making a partially sintered material using the self-heating high-temperature synthesis (SHS) of TiB2 and alumina. There has been also some research and development activity in processing copper-nickel, copper-nickel-iron and copper-based cermets for electrode materials (see US-A-6126799, US-A-6030518 and D R Sadoway: "Inert Anodes for Hall-Herraoult cell - the ultimate materials challenge", J Metals, vol. 53, May 2001, pp.34-35). However there appears to be some reliability issues for such electrode materials at high-temperatures due to the high solubility of copper in liquid and solid aluminium which may reduce the structural performance of the copper-based cermets.<br>
The present invention is based on the recognition that certain Al-M-Cu based alloys exhibit high-temperature strength, corrosion resistance and electrical conductivity without major resistive heat loss and so can be exploited as an inert electrode, in particular as an inert electrode to replace carbon anodes in a Hall-Heraoult cell for extraction of reactive metals such as Al, Ti, Nb, Ta, Cr and rare-earth metals.<br>
Thus viewed from one aspect the present invention provides an electrode {eg an anode) composed of an Al-M-Cu based alloy comprising an intermetallic phase of formula:<br>

It is quite well known within the aluminium industry that the Al3Ti phase can be dispersed via the reactive melting of aluminium metal in the presence of K2TiF6- The reaction between molten aluminium and K2TiF6 yields a mixture of A^Ti and aluminium metal. This technique has however been only used to make binary Al-Ti alloys with less than l-2wt% Ti for which the processing temperature is between 750°C and 850°C.<br>
Viewed from a further aspect the present invention provides a process for preparing an Al-M-Cu based alloy as hereinbefore defined comprising:<br>

In accordance with the process of the invention, the presence of fluorine (eg in a fluorine bath) advantageously reduces hydrogen solubility in the Al-M-Cu liquid to yield a porosity-free cast structure which would otherwise have a higher resistive loss due to a high volume of pores.<br>
The alkali fluorometallate may be a potassium or sodium alkali fluorometallate (eg fluorotitanate) salt.<br>

In a preferred embodiment, the process further comprises: (b) annealing the Al-M-Cu cast alloy from step (a).<br>
Step (b) may be carried out in an oxygen deficient atmosphere {eg an inert atmosphere such as argon or nitrogen) at temperatures typically in the range 600-1000°C (eg about 800°C). Step (b) serves to eliminate deleterious phases such as Al2Cu and other low melting point inhomogeneities.<br>
Step (b) may be preceded or succeeded by (c) the formation {eg coating) of an oxide layer on the Al-M-Cu surface. The oxide layer is preferably a mixed oxide layer containing alumina, iron oxide, nickel oxide and optionally chromium oxide. Step (c) may be carried out at an elevated temperature. The oxide layer may be formed from a slurry of mixed oxides which may be applied to the cast alloy before step (b) or be subjected to a separate heating step. By way of example, a preferred slurry is a 50:50 by volume water/ethyl alcohol comprising 35-45mol% Fe203, 30-45mol% NiO, 10-20mol% alumina and 0-5mol% Cr203.<br>
Viewed from a yet further aspect the present invention provides a method for extracting a reactive metal from a reactive metal-containing source comprising:<br>

For the extraction of aluminium, the molten bath is alumina-containing, particularly preferably alumina-saturated, especially preferably is an alumina-saturated cryolite flux. Preferably the cryolite flux comprises sodium-containing potassium cryolite {eg sodium-containing 3KF.A1F3 such as K3AlF6-Na3AlF6). The weight ratio of NaF to A1F3 in the sodium-containing potassium cryolite may be in the range to 1:1.5 to 1:2.<br><br>

PCT/GB2006/002147<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment, KBF4 is present in the cryolite flux. The presence of KBF4 dramatically improves the wettability of an electrode composed of an Al-M-Cu alloy.<br>
Preferably alloy comprises a passivating layer which prevents oxidation under anodic conditions.<br>
Viewed from a still yet further aspect the present invention provides the use of an Al-M-Cu based alloy as an anode in an electrolytic cell.<br>
Preferably the Al-M-Cu based alloy in this aspect of the invention is as hereinbefore defined.<br>

The phase relationship between Al3Ti, AlxTiyCuz and CuAl2 at 540°C is shown by way of example in Figure la and at 800°C is shown by way of example in Figure lb (see A Handbook of Ternary Aluminium Alloys - eds G. Petzow, G. Effenberg, Weiheim VCH, vol.8, Berlin (1988), pp. 51-67).<br>
The amount of titanium metal required for making the ternary intermetallic phase (AI5T12CU) was calculated and the proportionate amount of potassium fiuorotitanate (KzTiFfi) salt was obtained. The salt was reduced in the presence of liquid Al-Cu alloy to effect dissolution of Ti metal. The reduction of the salt with molten aluminium alloy is an exothermic reaction. Consequently the alloy temperature rises to maintain<br><br>
WO 2006/136785<br><br>
PCT/GB2006/002147<br><br>
the homogeneity of the alloy phase. The intermetallic phases Al3Ti and Al5Ti2Cu are virtually insoluble in molten aluminium and in the fluoride flux and so offer a unique property for casting alloy almost as a single phase by following the tie line in the Al-Ti-Cu phase diagram. It is evident from the ternary sections shown in Figures la and lb that it is along the %, Al5Ti2Cu, TiAlCu2 and p-TiCu4 phase tie line that the structurally stable compositions fall.<br>
From the phase diagram shown in Figure lc, the dominant phase transformation reactions, which occur after casting are:<br>
%oTiAl3+CuTi2Als	2a<br>
and<br>
Liquid (L) = 
Only a small proportion of 2c takes place<br>
L + CuTi 2Al5 =0 +TiAl 3	2c<br>
As the volume fraction of phase 8 (C11AI2) increases, the rate of liquid phase available above 570°C increases leading to poor thermal stability of the alloy phase.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Bearing in mind the existence of low-temperature liquid phases on the copper rich side of the Al-M-Cu phase diagram, compositions were investigated in which the structural and environmental stabilities of the alloy phase were optimised against the electronic conductivity. The reduction in the electronic resistivity as a function of temperature was established to demonstrate the usefulness of the ordered high-temperature alloys as inert electrodes. Three different types of alloy composition were prepared.<br><br><br>

Compositions<br>
A first example of a composition (Alloy-1) according to the formula (65+x) atomic % Al, (20+y) atomic % Ti, and (15-x-y) atomic % Cu was fixed along the isoplethal lines of Al:Ti ratio of 2-3 (preferably 2.7) with substitution of aluminium by copper.<br>
A second example of a composition (Alloy-2) falls along the tie line joining A^Ti with the AITICU2 phase field. This is a high copper phase field for which the electronic conductivity is much higher than Alloy-1.<br>
Further examples of compositions (Alloys-4 to -8) were multi-component derivatives of a third composition (Alloy-3) resulting from partial substitution by phase stabilising elements (Fe, Cr, Ni, V, La, Nb, Zr) to enhance high-temperature stability of the phases. These elements tend to form ordered phases with Al, Ti, and Cu along the tie lines shown in Figure lb.<br>

Processing Conditions<br>
The alloy compositions were melted by the following techniques.<br>
a)	The metallic elements were weighed and melted in an argon-arc melting furnace above 1500°C. After melting and cooling, the alloy compositions were remelted and homogenised in an argon atmosphere. The homogenised alloy compositions were cooled slowly and prepared for characterisation.<br>
b)	In a reactive melting technique, binary Al-Cu alloy was first melted using a potassium fluorotitanate flux. The flux melts above '550°C and is reactive with molten aluminium above the melting point of Al or the Al-Cu alloy. This melting sequence prevents loss of aluminium in the flux. It is also important for efficient incorporation of Ti in the alloy phase. The reaction between the potassium fluorotitanate salt and molten aluminium is exothermic and the heat generated is sufficient to keep a large volume of alloy above the liquidus temperature when the mass of the alloy exceeds a few kilograms. Excess thermal energy improves alloy homogeneity.<br>
The addition of copper at an early stage of melting proves advantageous for enhancing the solubility of titanium in the alloy phase. The arc-melted and the flux-melted alloy compositions were homogenised at 1350°C and then allowed to cool inside the copper crucible in the arc melter and alumina crucible in the radio-frequency coil respectively.<br>
The alloy produced after reactive melting with the fluoride salt in air was cast into a small mould. The as-cast material was analysed to determine its properties. Alloys-1 and 2 were thermally cycled using a differential thermal analysis instrument to study the effect of temperature on the likely phase transformation reactions which may potentially cause dimensional changes in the electrode structure. Table 2 presents the hardness of Alloys-1 and 2 in the as-cast and thermally-cycled conditions (Hv, load 10 kg)   and  their   as-cast  resistivity.   The  density  of Alloy-2   is   4.2gcm"3.

Room and high temperature resistivity measurements were carried out using an alloy sample which was 8.8mm long, 4.8mm deep and 5.3mm wide by measuring the voltage drop across the length of the electrode' while maintaining 1 A current at a given temperature.<br>
The results of thermal cycling shown in Figures 5a and 5b indicate that the alloy phase does not have a major 1st order transformation (volume related phase change) and that only a 2nd order transformation with a negligible change in the volume occurs at around 600°C. The presence of liquid phase due to reaction 2c (see above) is negligible in the small size structures which may be magnified in the large structures. The presence of minor liquid phase however can be compensated by the addition of excess M elements (see the tie lines in Figure lb).<br>
The as-cast resistivity of alloy 1 was 5 mohm cm which dropped to 4 mohm cm after the 1st thermal cycling. The effect of thermal cycling on the resistivities of Alloy-1 and 2 are shown in Figure 4 and the corresponding DTA curves are shown in Figures 5a and 5b.<br>
The resistivity measurements are compared with the resistivities (mohm cm) of pure copper, aluminium, titanium, graphite and a ceramic at 20°C in Table 3.<br><br><br>
WO 2006/136785<br><br>

The comparison of the resistivities of various metals and graphite with the alloy compositions confirm that there is between 275 and 350 times reduction in the Joule loss (I2R type) which will compensate for the necessary increase in the value of EMF due to the lack of production of CO2 (as in conventional techniques).<br>
Electrode Wettability and Corrosion Tests<br>
i) 4 cm long alloy ingots were suspended in a bath of molten sodium-containing (10% by weight) potassium cryolite (3KF.AIF3) in contact with liquid aluminium at 775°C. The length of ingot submerged in the flux bath was approximately 1 cm. It was allowed to stay in contact with molten flux for a maximum period of 1 hour at 775°C after which the ingot sample was withdrawn and examined for evidence for any high-temperature chemical attack. The ingot was wetted by cryolite flux and no chemical reaction between the ingot and the flux or metal or any discernible weight change was observed.<br>
ii) A high-temperature oxidation experiment was carried out by heating a lcm3 lump of alloy above 750°C in air for 2 hours. The alloy surface was slightly tarnished by developing a yellowish metal-like tinge which was also observed on the surface of Ti metals and its alloys. No weight change was observed.<br><br><br>
WO 2006/136785<br><br>
PCT/GB2006/002147<br><br>
iii) The presence of a small concentration of KBF4 (less than 5wt%) improved dramatically the wettability of alloy with K3AlF6-Na3AlF6 flux. It was observed that when the alloy was withdrawn from the B-containing flux, the alloy surface was clean and shiny compared with when no boron was present in the flux.<br>
Aluminium Extraction Test<br>
Using 100 ml of cryolite (21) saturated with alumina, cell tests for extracting aluminium metal (41) were carried out (see Figures 6a and 6b). The cell was an alumina crucible (22) comprising a cathode (24) with an alumina sheath (27), reference electrode (26) and anode (23) separated by an alumina partition (25). The alumina crucible (22) was situated in a carbon crucible (29) inside a stainless steel container (30). The cell further comprises a thermocouple (33) and an argon gas supply (2).<br>
Electrolysis experiments included the use of alloy anode and carbon cathode, carbon anode and carbon cathode, carbon anode and alloy cathode and alloy anode and T1B2 cathode to study reactions with cryolite. The electrolyte (21) consisted of 36 wt% NaF and 64 wt% AIF3. The bath was saturated with alumina using alumina spheres. The alumina and salt were charged through a port (35).<br>
The electrolysis experiment was carried out for 4-6 hours at different temperatures. A constant DC current of 4-6 A from a DC power supply (1) was passed through the cell and the cell voltage and temperature were measured using a data logger (3). The cell results are shown in Table 4. A typical plot of time against cell voltage and temperature is presented in Figure 7.<br>
For each cell test, it was found that cell voltage increased at the beginning due to the anode effect and then stabilised for a while and finally increased again. The small variations in the cell voltage are due to the various reactions of the anode surface with cryolite. Any voltage drop relates to corrosion reactions since the minimum voltage required for aluminium production using carbon anode is 4.5 V. For alloy anode, it is expected to be more due to the absence of CO2 generation. However by comparison<br><br><br>
WO 2006/136785<br><br>
PCT/GB2006/002147<br><br>
the alloy has much lower electrical resistivity compared with carbon (approximately 20 times) but 10 times higher than that of copper.<br>
The voltage rose in the final stage due to the loss of electrolyte via evaporation which then supersaturates the cryolite with respect to alumina. Since the cell current is fixed, any rise in voltage is a manifestation of increased bath resistance. The most important finding is that of the control of saturation of alumina in the bath. The presence of a passivating layer' and saturation of alumina in the bath are key to good corrosion resistance of the anode in the bath. Figure 8 shows the presence of a passivating layer on the peripheral surface of the anode (the bright phase). This anode shows very good corrosion resistance.<br>

EXAMPLE 3 - Compositions and their microstructures before and after corrosion tests<br>
Table 5 shows a typical example of a new composition of an AlTiCu alloy with the transition metals Ni, Fe and Cr (new S-NiFeCr) compared with composition S-NiFeCr of Example 2 (alloy code 5). The new composition falls in the left hand part of the ternary phase diagram illustrated in Figure 9 with an arrow. In this composition range, an equi-atomic ratio of Al: Ti (eg 35:35) can be mixed with a minor metal M = Cu, Fe, Cr or Ni which may vary between 3 at% to 30 at%. The alloy was melted in an argon atmosphere above 1500°C and was cast as before for the composition S-NiFeCr of Example 2. The development of the new composition arises from the analysis of the passivation layer in the S-FeNiCr alloy system of Example 2.<br>

Figures 10-12 compare the corrosion behaviour of two alloys in a different salt bath under identical temperature and atmospheric conditions. In particular, Figures 1 la and c illustrate corrosion behaviour of the new S-NiFeCr composition compared with that of the S-NiFeCr composition of Example 2 (alloy code 5) in Figures 1 lb and d. The new composition is shown to be more resistant to corrosion than the compositions discussed in Example 2 which had 60-70a% Al, 20-25 at% Ti, 3-5 at% Cu and the balance Fe, Cr, and Ni. The improved corrosion performance in the CaCl2 bath also used in the molten salt electro-winning of metals has been compared and verified. The small crevices in the microstructure are due to the presence of HC1 induced corrosion which is always prevalent when calcium chloride is heated above its melting point.<br><br>
