The above patent documents report the synthesis of the compounds in<br>
question. Typically the compounds are conceptually broken down via retrosynthetic<br>
analysis into key fragments when designing a synthetic route. Thus for example the<br>
compound reported as ZD9331 (also known as BGC 9331):<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
disclosed in EP-A-0562734 may be broken down retrosynthetically as follows:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
where PG is a protecting group such as pivaloyloxymethyl and X is a leaving group<br>
such as Br. The quinazoline component my thus be the compound [6-(bromomethyl)-<br>
-2,7-dimethyl-4-oxoquinazolin-3(4H)-yl]methylpivalate:<br>
Reported syntheses, for example as disclosed in J. Med. Chem. 1995, 38(6),<br>
994-1004 (Marsham et al.) and J. Med. Chem. 1996, 39(1), 7385 (Bavetsias et al.)<br>
make this compound by a scheme including the final free radical bromination step:<br>
where PG is a protecting group. The method gives a mixture of bromomethyl intermediates<br>
and the present inventors have found that this gives poor regioselectivity,<br>
only the first product being desired. Typically the following contaminants are found:<br>
3% 6%<br>
Similarly, a route to the compound raltitrexed:<br>
C02H<br>
raltitrexed<br>
disclosed in EP-A-0239362 would be made by a scheme including the free radical<br>
bromination step:<br>
where PG is a protecting group. The method again gives a mixture of bromomethyl<br>
intermediates and poor regioselectivity. Typically the following contaminants are<br>
found:<br>
PG<br>
N'<br>
1% 12%<br>
We have now developed an improved route to these key intermediate in which<br>
the regiochemistry is defined before cyclization occurs. Accordingly the present<br>
invention comprises a process for the preparation of a quinazolin-4-one derivative of<br>
formula (I):<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
where R1 and R2 are each independently hydrogen or methyl, PG is a<br>
protecting group such as pivaloyloxymethyl and X is a leaving group such as Br;<br>
including the step of cyclization an amide of formula (II):<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein R1 and R2 are as defined above and Y is a leaving group such as OAc;<br>
or a protected derivative thereof;<br>
to form a quinazolin-4-one derivative of formula (III):<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
or a protected derivative thereof.<br>
The protecting group PG could be any suitable group for protecting amines, as<br>
discussed in "Protective groups in organic synthesis" 3rd Ed, Theodora W Greene and<br>
Peter G Wuts, published by John Wiley, ISBN 0-471-16019-9. For example, as well<br>
as pivaloyloxymethyl mentioned above, PG could represent BOC (te/7-butoxycarbonyl).<br>
X can represent any suitable leaving group, for example bromide, chloride,<br>
iodide, tosylate, mesylate or triflate. Bromide is preferred as it gives the same<br>
quinazolin-4-one derivative of formula (I): as has been reported in previous routes,<br>
thus removing complications of new related substances in the final bulk drug product.<br>
Y can also represent any suitable leaving group displaceable by X, for<br>
example an acyloxy group such as Ci_4 acyloxy group or benzoyloxy.<br>
Although the route may use protected derivatives of the amide of formula (II)<br>
and quinazolin-4-one derivative of formula (III), additional protection could make the<br>
route less efficient and reduce the advantage of the approach. Thus we prefer that the<br>
route is done using the step of cyclization an amide of formula (II) to form a<br>
quinazolin-4-one derivative of formula (III) without further protection until after the<br>
step is completed.<br>
The compound of formula (III) may then be converted into the compound of<br>
formula (I) by protection of the ring nitrogen and interconversion of the leaving group<br>
Y to X. For example, if X is Br and Y is OAc, hydrogen bromide in acetic acid may<br>
be used to effect the conversion.<br>
The cyclization step may be performed under standard conditions. For<br>
example, hydrogen chloride in propan-2-oI may be used.<br>
The amide of formula (II) may be made by reacting a compound of formula<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
with a cyanide reagent. The compound of formula (IV) is made by a regioselective<br>
bromination step from a compound of formula (V) using the reaction step:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
We have found this to be highly regioselective, typically giving an 84:16<br>
mixture in favour of the desired compound of formula (IV). The undesired compound<br>
of formula (IVA) is typically lost in the work-up procedure.<br>
Thus in a further aspect of the invention there is provided a process for the<br>
preparation of a quinazolin-4-one derivative of formula (I) including the step of<br>
brominating a compound of formula (V):<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein R1 and R2 are as defined above and Y is a leaving group such as OAc;<br>
or a protected derivative thereof;<br>
to form a compound of formula (IV)<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
or a protected derivative thereof.<br>
The compound of formula (V) may be made by derivatization of an alcohol of<br>
formula (VI):<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The derivatization and bromination steps may be combined without isolation<br>
of the compound of formula (V). The alcohol of formula (VI) may be made by known<br>
methods by a scheme such as follows:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
followed by reduction of the aldehyde of formula (VII).<br>
Preferably at least one of R1 and R2 is methyl. Preferably R1 and R2 are both<br>
methyl.<br>
X In this specification the terms "alkyl", "alkenyl", "alkynyl" and "alkylene"<br>
include both straight and branched chain groups but references to individual alkyl or<br>
alkylene groups, such as "propyl", are specific for the straight chain group only. An<br>
analogous convention applies to other generic terms such as "acyloxy".<br>
It is to be understood that all the quinazolin-4-one derivatives disclosed may<br>
exhibit the phenomenon of tautomerism and that the formulae shown in this<br>
specification represent only one of the possible tautomeric forms. It is to be understood<br>
therefore that the invention is not limited merely to any one tautomeric form<br>
which is illustrated. For example, the quinazolin-4-one derivative of formula (HI)<br>
may also exist as a quinazolin-4-ol derivative of formula (IIIA):<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The compound of formula (III) and its halogeno and cyano precursors are key<br>
intermediates in the preferred ring-closing process. Thus in a further aspect of the<br>
invention there is provided a quinazolin-4-one derivative of formula (III):<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
where R1 and R2 are each independently hydrogen or methyl, and Y is a<br>
acyloxy group or benzoyloxy.<br>
These may be contrasted with intermediates disclosed in the prior art, e.g.:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
EP-A-0509643 EP-A-0284338 WO-A-98/43959<br>
In a further aspect of the invention there is provided an amide of formula<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein R1 and R2 are each independently hydrogen or methyl, Y is a<br>
acyloxy group or benzoyloxy and Z is Br or CN.<br>
These may be contrasted with intermediates disclosed in the prior art, e.g<br>
Pharmazie (1969), 24(2), 87-94 (Kleinschmidt et al.):<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The present invention may be used to prepare any of the relevant compounds<br>
in the prior art documents discussed above. For example, it can be used to prepare a<br>
quinazoline-4-one of formula (DC):<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein R1 and R2 are each independently hydrogen or methyl;<br>
R3 hydrogen, C1-4 alkyl, C3--4 alkenyl, C3-4 alkynyl, C3-4 hydroxyalkyl C2-4<br>
halogenoalkyl or C1-4 cyanoalkyl;<br>
and Ar is phenylene, thiophenediyl, thiazolediyl, pyridinediyl or pyrimidine-<br>
.diyl which may optionally bear one or two substituents selected from halogeno,<br>
hydroxy, amino, nitro, cyano, trifluoromethyl, C1-4 alkyl and C1-4 alkoxy;<br>
or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt or ester thereof.<br>
It can equally be used to prepare a quinazoline-4-one of formula (X):<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein R1, R2, R3 And Ar are as defined above;<br>
or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt or ester thereof.<br>
A suitable value for R3 when it is C1-4alkyl, or for a C1-4 alkyl substiruent<br>
which may be present on Ar, is, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl or isopropyl.<br>
A suitable value for R3 when it is C2-4 hydroxyalkyl is, for example,<br>
2-hydroxyethyl or 3-hydroxypropyl; when it is C2-4 halogenoalkyl is, for example,<br>
2-fluoroethyl, 2-chloroethyl, 2-bromoethyl, 3-fluoropropyl, 3-chloropropyl or<br>
3-bromopropyl; and when it is C1-4 cyanoalkyl is, for example, cyanomethyl,<br>
2-cyanoethyl or 3-cyanopropyl.<br>
A suitable value for a C1-4 alkoxy substituent which may be present on Ar is,<br>
for example, methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, isopropoxy or butoxy.<br>
A suitable value for a halogeno substituent which may be present on Ar is, for<br>
example, fluoro, chloro or bromo.<br>
A suitable value for R3 when it is C3_4 alkenyl is, for example, prop-2-enyl,<br>
but-2-enyl, but-3-enyl or 2-methylprop-2-enyl; and when it is C3-4 alkynyl is, for<br>
example, prop-2-ynyl or but-3-ynyl.<br>
A suitable value for Ar when it is phenylene is, for example, 1,3-or<br>
1,4-phenylene, especially 1,4-phenylene.<br>
A suitable value for Ar when it is thiophenediyl is, for example,<br>
thiophene-2,4-diyl or thiophene-2,5-diyl; when it is thiazolediyl is, for example<br>
thiazole-2,4-diyl or thiazole-2,5-diyl; when it is pyridinediyl is, for example,<br>
pyridine-2,4-diyl, pyridine-2,5-diyl, pyridine-2,6-diyl or pyridine-3,5-diyL; and when<br>
it is pyrimidinediyl is, for example, pyrimidine-2,4-diyl, pyrimidine-2,5-diyl or<br>
pyrimidine-4,6-diyl.<br>
As indicated, Ar may carry one or two substituents. A preferred level of<br>
substitution in Ar, where substitution is present, is either two substituents or<br>
especially one substituent; and the one or two substituents may conveniently be at<br>
positions adjacent to the atom bonded to the group —COOH, halogeno substituents<br>
such as fluoro being preferred.<br>
Compounds that can be so prepared include the following:<br>
