BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to an encoder/decoder of a<br>
wireless communication system using a plurality of antennas, and more<br>
particularly to a method and an apparatus for space-time coding/decoding using<br>
low density parity check codes.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
According to a space-time coding technique, signals output through a<br>
coding scheme are transmitted through a plurality of transmission antennas in<br>
such a manner that the coding scheme used in a time region can be also embodied<br>
in a spatial area, thereby achieving a low error rate.<br>
FIG. 1 is a view illustrating a transmitter/receiver utilizing a space-time<br>
scheme. Referring to FIG. 1, the transmitter/receiver includes a space-time<br>
encoder 100, a space-time decoder 102, a plurality of transmission antennas 110<br>
to 114 for transmitting signals output from the space-time encoder 100, and a<br>
plurality of reception antennas 120 to 124 for receiving signals output from the<br>
transmission antennas 110 to 114. The number of the transmission antennas 110<br>
to 114 can be different from the number of the reception antennas 120 to 124.<br>
The space-time encoder 100 codes input signals (input data) according to<br>
a predetermined coding rate. If the number of input data is k and the number of<br>
data output from the space-time encoder 100 is N, the coding rate of the space-<br>
time encoder 100 is k/N.<br>
The transmission antennas 110 to 114 sequentially transmit symbols<br>
output from the space-time encoder 100. If symbols are transmitted through NT<br><br>
transmission antennas, the coding rate of the space-time encoder 100 is <br>
Each of the reception antennas 120 to 124 receives symbols transmitted<br>
through the transmission antennas 110 to 114. The first reception antenna 120<br>
receives symbols transmitted through the first to NT transmission antennas 110 to<br>
114. The second reception antenna 122 receives symbols transmitted through the<br>
first to NT transmission antennas 110 to 114. The NR reception antenna 124<br>
receives symbols transmitted through the first to NT transmission antennas 110 to<br>
114.<br>
The space-time decoder 102 decodes symbols received through the<br>
reception antennas 120 to 124 according to a predetermined decoding rate. The<br>
decoding rate of the space-time decoder 102 is determined according to the<br>
coding rate of the space-time encoder 100. That is, if the coding rate of the space-<br>
time encoder 100 is k/N, the decoding rate of the space-time decoder 102 is N/k.<br>
The space-time decoder 102 searches signals transmitted from the<br>
transmission antennas 110 to 114 by decoding received symbols. The space-time<br>
encoder 100 will be described in more detail herein below.<br>
FIG. 2 is a view illustrating a conventional layered space-time encoder.<br>
The term "layered" signifies that channel coded data is transmitted through each<br>
transmission antenna according to a predetermined scheme.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, a channel encoder used in the layered space-time<br>
encoder utilizes a predetermined channel coding scheme. A coding rate of the<br>
layered space-time encoder is NT X R, wherein R is a coding rate of a channel<br>
encoder and NT is a number of antennas. The layered space-time encoder includes<br>
a channel encoder 200, a serial/parallel converter 202 for converting serial signals<br>
into parallel signals, a plurality of antenna interleavers 204 to 206, signal<br>
mapping units 208 to 210 used for each antenna, and multiple antennas 212 to<br>
214. In FIG. 2, ‚àè1 is an ith antenna interleaves The number of the antenna<br>
interleavers 204 to 206 and signal mapping units 208 to 210 is determined<br><br>
according to the number of multiple antennas 212 to 214.<br>
Input data is coded through the channel encoder 200 in order to produce a<br>
signal having high reliability. Output data of the cannel encoder 200 passes<br>
through the serial/parallel converter 202 in order to be transmitted to NT antennas.<br>
Output data of the serial/parallel converter 202 is input into antenna interleavers<br>
204 to 206, which sequentially interleave input data.<br>
In addition, output data of the antenna interleavers 204 to 206 is mapped<br>
into desired signals by means of signal mapping units 208 to 210, before the<br>
output data is transmitted to the transmission antennas. The signal mapping units<br>
208 to 210 determine input bit symbols as signals to be transmitted through the<br>
transmission antennas based on a constellation corresponding to a set of k bits.<br>
Accordingly, the constellation may vary depending on a size n of, i.e., the<br>
number of, input bits. For example, if a value of n is 1, the constellation can be<br>
embodied through a BPSK (binary phase shift keying) scheme in which a phase<br>
of a signal is converted corresponding to a transmission code using a carrier<br>
having constant amplitude and frequency. If a value of n is 2, the constellation can<br>
be embodied through a QPSK (quadrature phase shift keying) scheme. Further, if<br>
a value of n is 3, the constellation can be embodied through an 8QAM<br>
(quadrature amplitude modulation) scheme.<br>
FIG. 3 is a view illustrating a conventional layered space-time decoder.<br>
More specifically, the space-time decoder illustrated in FIG. 3 is called a "layered<br>
space-time decoder" corresponding to the layered space-time encoder illustrated<br>
in FIG. 2.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, a frame data array transmitted through a plurality of<br>
transmission antennas is received in a predetermined reception antenna. If three<br>
reception antennas are provided, all of three reception antennas may receive the<br>
frame data array transmitted through three transmission antennas. The layered<br>
space-time decoder includes NR reception antennas 300 to 302, a detector 304, a<br>
decoder 312, NR antenna de-interleavers 306 to 308, NR antenna interleavers 316<br>
to 318, a parallel/serial converter 310, and a serial/parallel converter 314.<br><br>
Each of NR reception antennas 300 to 302 receives signals transmitted<br>
from each of transmission antennas. Data received in the reception antennas 300<br>
to 302 is detected by the detector 304, and a transmission signal for each<br>
transmission antenna is detected. Output data of the detector 304 is input into<br>
antenna de-interleavers 306 to 308 corresponding to antenna interleavers 204 to<br>
206 of the layered space-time encoder. That is, antenna interleaved data of the<br>
layered space-time encoder is de-interleaved to obtain original data.<br>
Output data of the antenna de-interleaver is input into the parallel/serial<br>
converter 310, which converts parallel data into serial data, such that the output<br>
data is converted into serial data. In addition, output data of the parallel/serial<br>
converter 310 is input into the decoder 312. The decoder 312 is corresponding to<br>
the encoder of the layered space-time encoder and is used to reliably restore the<br>
signal.<br>
Output data of the decoder 312 is identical to signals, which have not<br>
been decoded in the transmitter, if there is no error caused by channel<br>
environment. However, if the error occurs due to the channel envirmement an<br>
iterative decoding is performed in order to precisely decode the reception signal.<br>
Accordingly, output data of the decoder 312 passes through the<br>
serial/parallel converter 314, which converts serial data into parallel data, and is<br>
input into antenna interleavers 316 to 318. Output data of the antenna interleaver<br>
is again input into the detector and an iterative decoding is performed. The<br>
iterative decoding may improve reliability of restored data.<br>
If the signal is reliably restored in the decoder 312 through the iterative<br>
decoding, an output of the decoder 312 is determined as a reception signal.<br>
An object of the next generation wireless mobile communication system<br>
is to provide a multi-media service using a ground communication network and a<br>
satellite communication network. In order to provide the multi-media service, a<br>
high transmission rate and a low error rate are required. Therefore, in order to<br>
continuously transmit data with a high quality and a high reliability in an inferior<br><br>
transmission environment, an efficient channel coding technique must be used in<br>
the space-time coding.<br>
The channel coding technique may vary according to the property of the<br>
channel. For example, an error-correcting code is used for the channel coding<br>
technique. An object of the error-correcting code is to obtain reliable<br>
communication under inferior channel environment. That is, data is coded using a<br>
channel code before data is transmitted through the channel, and then,<br>
information identical to original information is extracted from a channel output at<br>
a reception terminal.<br>
A basic characteristic of such a system is based on Shannon's channel<br>
coding theory. According to Shannon's channel coding theory, if an optimal<br>
coding is performed with regard to information, there is a limitation to reduce an<br>
error occurring in a channel having noise without causing loss of an information<br>
transmission rate. Such a coding theory has been developed for several decades.<br>
Among concatenated codes using convolutional codes, turbo codes using<br>
an iterative decoding technique are provided for a high-reliable channel coding<br>
technique for 3r generation wireless communication IMT-2000, which provides<br>
voice and low-speed multimedia services of several hundreds Kbps to few Mbps.<br>
The turbo codes, which were presented in 1993, may perform the coding<br>
operation by using parallel concatenated RSC (Recursive systematic<br>
convolutional) codes and perform the decoding operation through the iterative<br>
decoding technique. In addition, the turbo codes represent superior performance<br>
approaching the Shannon's limitation in view of a bit error rate (BER) if a size of<br>
an interleaver is large and the iterative decoding is sufficiently performed.<br>
However, if the turbo codes are employed, the number of operations may<br>
increase, thereby causing complexity. In addition, as the number of interleavers<br>
and iterative decoding operations increase, a time delay may occur, making a real<br>
time process difficult.<br>
4 generation wireless communication systems have been developed in<br>
order to provide voice and high-speed multimedia services. An error correcting<br><br>
code for the 4th generation wireless communication system has not been yet<br>
determined. Because the 4th generation wireless communication system requires a<br>
lower error rate (voice and data: 10-6 to 10-9), it is necessary to provide a new<br>
error correcting code.<br>
Consequently, a low density parity check (LDPC) code has been<br>
suggested. The LDPC code has superior coding characteristics as compared with<br>
conventional turbo codes, in view of complexity and performance. The LDPC<br>
code is a linear block code in which most elements of parity check matrix (H)<br>
are "0". The LDPC code could not be technically embodied at that time of<br>
invention due to the complexity of the decoding. As a result, the LDPC code has<br>
not been implemented for a long time.<br>
Mackay and Neal have recovered the LDPC code and found that the<br>
LDPC code represents superior performance, if a simple probabilistic coding<br>
technique of Gallager is used.<br>
More specifically, the LDPC code is defined by a random parity check<br>
matrix H in which the number of "1" in the matrix is sparsely distributed. The<br>
parity check matrix H is a matrix for determining if the coding is normally<br>
performed with regard to the reception signal. If a value obtained through<br>
multiplying a coded reception signal parity check matrix H is "0', an error<br>
does not occur.	<br>
A predetermined parity check matrix, which results a value of "0" when it<br>
is multiplied by coded reception signals, is firstly designed, and then, a coding<br>
operation is performed at a transmitter encoder according the predetermined<br>
parity check matrix. The parity check matrix H has structural characteristics as<br>
follows.<br>
First, each row is formed with elements having a value "1" with k-<br>
weights, where k is as uniformly formed as possible.<br>
Second, each column is formed with elements having a value of "1" with<br>
j-weights. Generally, j is 3 or 4.<br><br>
Third, an overlap between two columns is randomly made in such a<br>
manner that the overlap is not larger than "1". Herein, the weight signifies the<br>
number of elements, which have values other than "0", existing in each column of<br>
the parity check matrix. In addition, the overlap between two columns means an<br>
inner product between rows. Accordingly, the weight of the row and column is<br>
very small as compared with a code length.<br>
The LDPC code can be decoded in a factor graph using an iterative<br>
decoding algorithm based on a sum-product algorithm. By employing a decoding<br>
technique using the iterative decoding algorithm based on the sum-product<br>
algorithm, a decoder employing the LDPC code has complexity that is lower than<br>
that of a decoder using the turbo code, and a parallel processing decoder can be<br>
easily embodied.<br>
If the LDPC code is represented in the factor graph, a cycle is formed in<br>
the factor graph of the LDPC code. As generally known in the art, the iterative<br>
decoding in the factor graph of the LDPC code having the cycle is a sub-optimal<br>
decoding. In addition, an experiment shows that the LDPC code represents<br>
superior performance through the iterative decoding. However, if a plurality of<br>
cycles having a short length exist in the factor graph of the LDPC code,<br>
performance of the LPDC code may be. degraded. Therefore, a number of studies<br>
have been continuously carried out in order to design the LDPC code such that<br>
the cycles having a short length may not exist in the factor graph of the LDPC<br>
code.<br>
Due to a characteristic of a generating matrix having a high weight, the<br>
coding procedure of the LDPC code is performed using a parity check matrix<br>
having a low weight density. In particular, if a partial matrix corresponding to a<br>
parity of the parity check matrix has a uniform formation, the LDPC can be<br>
effectively coded.<br>
Because the LDPC includes codes with various values, other than "0", it<br>
is very important to develop effective coding and decoding algorithms for various<br>
LDPC codes in order to practically utilize the LDPC code. In addition, because<br><br>
the parity check matrix of the LDPC code may determine performance of the<br>
LDPC code, it is very important to design the effective parity check matrix having<br>
superior performance. That is, the effective parity check matrix having superior<br>
performance and the effective coding and decoding algorithms must be<br>
simultaneously considered in order to create the LDPC code having superior<br>
performance.<br>
As described above, the LDPC code is defined by the parity check matrix,<br>
in which most elements thereof have values of "0" and remaining elements<br>
thereof have values of "1". For example, the (N, j, k) LDPC code is a linear block<br>
code having a block length of N, in which j-elements having values of "1" are<br>
provided in each column and k-elements having values of "1" are provided in<br>
each row. Elements, except for the elements having values of "1", are defined by<br>
the parity check matrix having a sparse structure including elements having<br>
values of "0".<br>
The LDPC code is called a "regular LDPC code", if j-weights are<br>
regularly formed in each column of the parity check matrix and k-weights are<br>
regularly formed in each row of the parity check matrix. However, if the number<br>
of weights in each column and each row of the parity check matrix is irregularly<br>
formed, the LDPC code is called a 'irregular LDPC code". Generally, the<br>
irregular LDPC code has superior performance as compared with the regular<br>
LDPC code. In the irregular LDPC code, the weight in each column of the parity<br>
check matrix is not identical to the weight in each row of the parity check matrix.<br>
Accordingly, the weights in each column and each row of the parity check matrix<br>
must be properly adjusted to ensure superior performance.<br>
Accordingly, the space-time encoder/decoder illustrated in FIGs. 1 and 2<br>
can have superior channel coding/decoding performance, if the space-time<br>
encoder/decoder performs the coding/decoding operation using the LDPC code.<br>
The conventional layered space-time code must perform various channel<br>
coding operations in order to obtain an optimum coding gain with respect to<br>
various antennas. Therefore, it is difficult to use various antennas. That is, a<br>
channel encoder used for two antennas cannot be used for three antennas. Using<br><br>
the layered space-time code, it is possible to obtain a high coding gain under high<br>
correlation between signals transmitted to antennas. However, it is impossible to<br>
make high correlation between transmission signals if a random channel code is<br>
used.<br>
That is, using the layered space-time code, the signals are individually<br>
transmitted to the antennas, and superior performance cannot be ensured. More<br>
specifically, when the above LDPC code is used, superior performance may be<br>
ensured as correlation between bits transmitted through a multiple antenna<br>
becomes high. However, if the LDPC code is randomly designed, it is difficult to<br>
improve correlation between signals transmitted to antennas.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

and other problems occurring in the prior art, and it is an object of the present<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail<br>
herein below with reference to the accompanying drawings. In addition, a<br>
detailed description of known functions and configurations incorporated herein<br>
will be omitted when it mayobscure the subject matter of the present invention.<br>
The present invention provides a lifting LDPC code for expanding an<br>
LDPC code according to a number of antennas in a space-time encoder/decoder<br>
utilizing the lifting LDPC code. In addition, the present invention suggests a<br>
lifting LDPC code capable of improving a correlation between signals transmitted<br>
to each antenna in a space-time encoder/decoder, thereby ensuring a reliable<br>
coding/decoding of a signal.<br>
The present invention is not limited by the following description, but is<br>
applicable for various encoders and decoders utilizing the LDPC code in a system<br>
for transmitting signals using a multiple antenna.<br>
Prior to describing the layered space-time encoder/decoder utilizing the<br>
lifting LDPC code according to the present invention, structures of the LDPC<br>
code and lifting LDPC code used for the layered space-time encoder/decoder will<br>
be described in detail.<br>
FIG. 4 is a view illustrating a parity check matrix of the (8,2,4) LDPC<br><br>
code, as an example of a (Nj,k) LDPC code. Referring to FIG. 4, the parity check<br>
matrix H of the (8,2,4) LDPC code includes eight columns and four rows. A<br>
weight of 2 is regularly added to each column. Because the weight is regularly<br>
added to each column of the parity check matrix, the (8,2,4) LDPC code becomes<br>
a regular LDPC code. If the weight is irregularly added to each column of the<br>
column, the (8,2,4) LDPC code becomes an irregular LDPC code.<br>
FIG. 5 is a factor graph (or bipartite graph)of the regular (8,2,4) LDPC<br>
code illustrated in FIG. 4. Referring to FIG. 5, the factor graph of the regular<br>
(8,2,4) LDPC code includes eight variable nodes (i.e., V1 500 to V8 514) and four<br>
check nodes 516, 518, 520, and 522. If an element having "1" exists at a cross<br>
point between an ith column and a Jth row in the parity check matrix of the (8,2,4)<br>
LDPC code, a branch is created between a variable node Vi and a jth check node.<br>
For example, in a first row of the parity check matrix illustrated in FIG. 4,<br>
1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th columns have values of "1". Therefore, the first check node<br>
516 illustrated in FIG. 5 is connected to V1 500, V3 504, V5 508, and V7 512.<br>
Similarly, in a second row of the parity check matrix, 1st, 4th, 6th, and 8th columns<br>
have values of "1", and the second check node 518 is connected to V1 500, V4 506,<br>
V6 510, and V8 514. Accordingly, the third and fourth check nodes 520 and 522<br>
can be represented in the same manner as described above.<br>
Because the parity check matrix of the LDPC code has a smaller number<br>
of non-zero elements, the decoding can be realized even in a block code having a<br>
relatively long length through the iterative decoding. In addition, similarly to the<br>
turbo code, the LDPC code has superior performance, i.e., approaching the<br>
Shannon's channel capacity limitation, if the block length of the block code is<br>
continuously increased. In addition, Mackay and Neal have already proven that<br>
the iterative decoding procedure of the LDPC code utilizing a flow transfer<br>
scheme represents performance similar to performance of the iterative decoding<br>
procedure of the turbo code.<br>
Hereinafter, a lifting LDPC code based on the LDPC code and used for<br>
the present invention will be described. The term "lifting" signifies a method for<br>
expanding a size of a basic matrix through a sub-matrix replacement with respect<br><br>
to a matrix consisting of "0" and "1". That is, according to the lifting LDPC code,<br>
avalue of each element in the parity check matrix of the LDPC code is expande3 *<br>
through the sub-matrix replacement.<br>
The lifting LDPG code will be described in detail with reference to FIGS.<br>
6A to 6C.<br>
As described above, a branch is created between a variable node V1 and a<br>
jth check node Cj, if an element having a weight value of "1" exists at a cross<br>
point between an ith column and a jth row in the parity check matrix of the LDPC<br>
code. According to the lifting scheme, a predetermined k x k sub-matrix is<br>
replaced with an element having a value of "1" in the parity check matrix, such<br>
that the variable node Vi is expanded into Vi.1, Vi.2, ..., Vi,k, and the jth check node<br>
Cj is expanded into Cj.i, Cj.2,..., Cj,k.<br>
The expanded k-variable nodes and k-check nodes can be represented in<br>
the form of a factor graph according to the k x k sub-matrix. FIGS. 6A to 6C<br>
illustrate variations of the branch between the variable node V; and the jth check<br>
node Cj when k of the k x k sub-matrix is 2, 3, and 4.<br>
FIG. 6A illustrates a variation of the branch between the check node and<br>
the variable node, if an element having a value of "1" in the parity check matrix is<br>
replaced with two 2x2 sub-matrices, in order to use the lifting LDPC code when<br>
two transmission antennas are utilized. That is, a predetermined parity check<br>
matrix can be expanded into two matrices as illustrated in FIG. 6A in relation to<br>
the element having a value of "1". Accordingly, the element can be represented<br>
through two factor graphs including a factor graph in which Cj.i forms a branch<br>
together with Vj.i, and Cj.2 forms a branch together with Vj.2, and a factor graph in<br>
which Cj.i forms a branch together with Vj.2, and Cj2 forms a branch together with<br>
Vi.1.<br>
FIG. 6B illustrates a factor graph representing a variation of the branch, if<br>
the element having a value of "1" is replaced with a 3 x 3 sub-matrix, in order to<br>
use the lifting LDPC code when three transmission antennas are utilized.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6B, the element having a value of "1" in the parity check matrix<br><br>
can be represented through three factor graphs.<br>
FIG. 6C illustrates a factor graph representing a variation of the branch, if<br>
the element having a value of "1" is replaced with 4x4 sub-matrices, in order to<br>
use the lifting LDPC code when four transmission antennas are utilized. Referring<br>
to FIG. 6C, the element having a value of "1" in the parity check matrix can be<br>
represented through four factor graphs.<br>
Accordingly, besides the matrices illustrated in FIGS. 6A to 6C, other<br>
permutation matrices can be used for lifting the LDPC code.<br>
Further, the branch can be variously changed according to the sub-matrix,<br>
which is substituted for the element "1" of the parity check matrix as illustrated in<br>
FIGS. 6A to 6C. Hereinafter, a method for utilizing the lifting LDPC code in a<br>
space-time code when two transmission antennas are used will be described with<br>
reference to FIGS. 7A to 8B.<br>
FIG. 7A is a view illustrating matrix variation of a lifting low density<br>
parity check code according to a first embodiment of the present invention, and<br>
FIG. 7B is a factdr graph representing the lifting low density parity check code<br>
shown in FIG. 7A. In addition, FIG. 8A is a view illustrating matrix variation of a<br>
lifting low density parity check code according to a second embodiment of the<br>
present invention, and FIG. 8B is a factor graph representing the lifting low<br>
density parity check code illustrated in FIG. 8A.<br>
Embodiment 1<br>
FIG. 7A illustrates a matrix in which an identity matrix is placed in a<br>
position of an element having a value of "1" in a 4 x 8 matrix 700, and a 0-matrix<br>
is placed in a position of an element having a value of "0", thereby lifting a basic<br>
4x8 matrix 702 into a 8 x 16 matrix 704. Referring to FIG. 7A, the parity check<br>
matrix (H) 700 is converted into the basic 4x8 matrix 702 and each element<br>
having a value of "1" in the parity check matrix is replaced with a 2 x 2 matrix<br>
through a predetermined method as described with reference to FIG. 6A. That is,<br>
13 elements having a value of "1" in the 4 x 8 parity check matrix (H) 700 are<br>
replaced with the 2 x 2 sub-matrix including S1 to S13, thereby lifting the parity<br><br>
check matrix (H) 700.<br>
The 2x2 sub-matrix of S1 to S13 can be embodied in various patterns. In<br>
FIG. 7A, S1 to S13 are represented in the form of an identity matrix. Therefore, the<br>
4x8 parity check matrix (H) 700 is lifted into the 2 x 2 matrix and the 8x16<br>
matrix 704 is created.<br>
In addition, the lifting LDPC matrix shown in FIG. 7A can be represented<br>
through a factor graph illustrated in FIG. 7B. Referring to FIG. 7B, because<br>
elements having a value of "1" in the parity check matrix 700 are replaced with<br>
the identity matrix, a factor graph 708 can be represented as two factor graphs,<br>
which are obtained by expanding a factor graph 706 by two times. Accordingly,<br>
the factor graph 708 is represented as two factor graphs 706 before the lifting has<br>
been performed.<br>
In the factor graph 708, parts related to Vi.1 indicate data transmitted<br>
through a first antenna and parts related to Vi.2indicate data transmitted through a<br>
second antenna.<br>
Embodiment 2<br>
Hereinafter, a second embodiment of the present invention for improving<br>
a correlation between bit arrays transmitted to each antenna will be described<br>
with reference to FIGS. 8A and 8B.<br>
Generally, variable node connected to the same check	node have a high<br>
correlation with each other during a decoding procedure. Therefore, in a layered<br>
space-time code using the lifting LDPC code according to the second<br>
embodiment of the present invention, data transmitted to different antennas are<br>
connected to the same check node, thereby improving correlation between data<br>
transmitted to a multiple antenna. For example, differently from the first<br>
embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 7A and 7B, the second embodiment illustrated in<br>
FIGS. 8A and 8B does not replace the elements having a value of "1" with the<br>
identity matrix, but replace the elements with a permutation matrix, thereby<br>
'	<br>
improving correlation between transmission signals.<br><br>
In addition, as shown in Equation (1), two 2x2 permutation matrices<br>
may be used as the permutation matrices.<br><br>
Accordingly, if elements having a value of "1" in a 4 x 8 matrix 800 are<br>
sequentially replaced with P1 and P2 as shown in Equation 1, lifting matrices 802<br>
and 804 can be obtained.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8A, after forming the 4 x 8 party check matrix H 800,<br>
elements having the value of "1" in the parity check matrix H 800 are replaced<br>
with a 2 x 2 matrix through a method as described in relation to FIG. 6A. That is,<br>
13 elements having the value of "1" in the parity check matrix H 800 are<br>
expanded into the 2 x 2 sub-matrix of S1 to S13, thereby lifting the parity check<br>
matrix H 800.<br>
The 2x2 sub-matrix of S1 to S13 can be embodied in various patterns. In<br>
FIG. 8A, S1 to S13 are represented in the form of the permutation matrices P, and<br>
P2. Therefore, the 4x8 parity check matrix (H) 800 is lifted into the 2x2 matrix,<br>
such that the 8 x 16 matrix 804 is created. That is, according to the second<br>
embodiment of the present invention, P1 is applied to S2, S3, S5, S8, S9, and S12,<br>
and P2 is applied to S1, S4, S6, S7, S10, S11, and S13.<br>
The permutation matrices P1 and P2 can be alternately mapped into the<br>
same position of the parity check matrix. When the sub-matrices are mapped into<br>
the position of "1', at least one of elements provided in one row must be different<br>
from other elements of the sub-matrix, such as S7 of a first row consisting of S3,<br>
S7, and S12.<br>
The lifting LDPC matrix illustrated in FIG. 8A can be represented as a<br>
factor graph illustrated in FIG. 8B. Referring to FIG. 8B, because elements having<br>
. a value of "1" in the lifting parity check matrix are replaced with the permutation<br>
matrix P1 or P2, a factor graph 808 can be represented as two factor graphs, which<br><br>
are obtained by expanding a factor graph 806 by two times. In addition,<br>
differently from the first embodiment illustrated in FIG. 7B, the expanded two<br>
factor graphs according to the second embodiment of the present invention have a<br>
correlation with each other, thereby forming a branch as illustrated in FIG. 8B.<br>
More specifically, in FIG. 8B, parts represented with solid lines are<br>
branches connected to data transmitted to a first antenna, and parts represented<br>
with dotted lines are branches connected to data transmitted to a second antenna.<br>
Accordingly, it is understood from the factor graph 808 of the lifting matrix<br>
utilizing the permutation matrices that bit arrays transmitted from each antenna<br>
are connected to the same check node, differently from the bit arrays in the factor<br>
graph 708 illustrated in FIG. 7B. That is, a first check node C1,1 forms branches<br>
together with V3,1, V5,2, and V8,1 according to the lifting LDPC matrix illustrated<br>
in FIG. 8A. The branches connected to the V3,1 and V8,1 represented with solid<br>
lines are connected to data transmitted to the first antenna. In addition, the branch<br>
connected to the V5,2 represented with a dotted line is connected to data<br>
transmitted to the second antenna. Accordingly, it is understood that bit arrays<br>
transmitted from two antennas are connected to the same check node. The same<br>
rule is applied to remaining check nodes C1,2 to C4,2.<br>
To summarize, when the lifting LDPC matrix is formed in accordance<br>
with the second embodiment of the present invention, a correlation between bit<br>
arrays transmitted from each antenna can be improved. Of course, the correlation<br>
between bit arrays transmitted from each antenna can be improved through<br>
various methods besides the above method. For example, the correlation between<br>
bit arrays can be improved by variously forming the sub-matrices when lifting the<br>
LDPC matrix.<br>
Although the first and second embodiments of the present invention have<br>
been described in relation to two antennas, the present invention is also applicable<br>
when three antennas or more are provided, by converting a size of the lifting<br>
matrix. If three antennas are provided, the elements of the LDPC matrix are<br>
expanded into 3x3 sub-matrices. If n antennas are provided, the elements of the<br>
LDPC matrix are expanded into n x n sub-matrices. Accordingly, various sub-<br>
matrices can be utilized in order to improve relationship between data transmitted<br><br>
through each antenna.<br>
FIG. 9 is a flowchart illustrating a coding procedure of a space-time<br>
encoder utilizing a lifting low density parity check code according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 9, a lifting LDPC coding<br>
isperformed on data to be transmitted by a number of antennas in step 900. A<br>
lifting LDPC coding scheme is identical to the LDPC coding scheme as described<br>
with reference to FIGS. 7A to 8B. The LDPC coded data is serial-parallel<br>
converted in step 902 and distributed, in order to be transmitted through multiple<br>
transmission antennas. The distributed data may pass through transmission<br>
antenna interleaving in step 904. However, it is not necessary to provide<br>
transmission antenna interleavers having the same structures. The data passing<br>
through the transmission antenna interleaving step in 904 is input into a signal<br>
mapping unit in order to perform a symbol mapping with respect to the data input<br>
thereto in step 906. The data is then transmitted through the multiple transmission<br>
antennas.<br>
FIG. 10 is a block diagram illustrating a space-time encoder utilizing a<br>
lifting low density parity check code according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention. Hereinafter, the space-time encoder utilizing a lifting low density<br>
parity check code will be referred to as "a lifting LDPC space-time encoder".<br>
Referring to FIG. 10, the lifting LDPC space-time encoder includes a<br>
lifting LDPC encoder 1004, a serial/parallel converter 1006, and interleavers<br>
1008 to 1010 and signal mapping units 1012 to 1014 corresponding to<br>
transmission antennas 1016 to 1018. In addition, the lifting LDPC space-time<br>
encoder includes a transmission antenna information unit 1000 for inputting<br>
information related to the number of the transmission antennas and a controller<br>
1002 for controlling a lifting according to the number of the transmission<br>
antennas are provided.<br>
The number of the interleavers 1008 to 1010 and signal mapping units<br>
1012 to 1014 corresponds to the number of the transmission antennas. The<br>
interleavers 1008 to 1010 and signal mapping units 1012 to 1014 have the same<br>
structures or different structures, respectively. In FIG. 10, the number of<br><br>
transmission antennas is NT, and the number of the interleavers and signal<br>
mapping units is also NT, respectively.<br>
The transmission antenna information unit 1000 transmits information<br>
related to the number of the transmission antennas 1016 to 1018 to the lifting<br>
controller 1002 in order to enable the lifting LDPC space-time encoder to create a<br>
proper lifting LDPC code that corresponds to the number of the transmission<br>
antennas 1016 to 1018.<br>
In addition, the lifting controller 1002 receiving the information related to<br>
the number of the transmission antennas 1016 to 1018 controls the lifting LDPC<br>
encoder 1004 in order to enable the lifting LDPC encoder 1004 to perform the<br>
lifting LDPC coding according to the number of the transmission antennas. That<br>
is, in order to perform the lifting LDPC space-time coding, a lifting LDPC coding<br>
is performed with respect to signals input into the lifting LDPC encoder 1004<br>
using the LDPC codes having superior performance under the control of the<br>
lifting controller 1002 corresponding to the number of the transmission antennas,<br>
which is obtained using information from the transmission antenna information<br>
unit 1000.<br>
Output data of the lifting LDPC encoder 1004 is distributed to NT<br>
transmission antennas through the serial/parallel converter 1006. The data<br>
distributed to the transmission antennas is interleaved through the antenna<br>
interleavers 1008 to 1010. The data passing through the antenna interleavers 1008<br>
to 1010 is symbol-mapped through the signal mapping units 1012 to 1014 before<br>
it is transmitted to the transmission antennas 1016 to 1018. The signal mapping<br>
units 1012 to 1014 can perform the symbol mapping with respect to the data<br>
through various modulation schemes, such as BPSK, QPSK, 16QAM, 64QAM,<br>
and 128QAM. The output data of the signal mapping units 1012 to 1014 is<br>
transmitted through the NT transmission antennas 1016 to 1018.<br>
The conventional LDPC encoder distributes input signals into each of<br>
transmission antennas without performing the above lifting procedure. As a result,<br>
it is difficult to design LDPC codes that correspond to the number transmission<br>
antennas.<br><br>
However, according to the present invention, the LDPC code is lifted<br>
according to a predetermined rule based on the number of the transmission<br>
antennas. As a result, the LDPC coding can be easily achieved. In addition,	the<br>
lifting can be obtained through various lifting schemes, such that a correlation<br>
between data transmitted through the transmission antennas may be improved,<br>
thereby lowering an error rate caused by inferior channel environment.<br>
FIG. 11 is a flowchart illustrating a decoding procedure of a space-time<br>
decoder utilizing a lifting low density parity check code according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 11, signals transmitted<br>
from the NT transmission antennas are received in NR reception antennas in step<br>
1100. Each of the reception antennas may receive all of signals transmitted from<br>
the NT transmission antennas. That is, a first reception antenna can receive the<br>
signals transmitted from the first to NTth transmission antennas. In the same way,<br>
each of the second to NRth reception antennas can receive the signals transmitted<br>
from the first to NTth transmission antennas.<br>
The signals transmitted from each of the transmission antennas are<br>
detected through a detector based on the signals received in each of the reception<br>
antennas in step 1102. The signals can be detected through various detection<br>
schemes. Additionally, as the detection schemes for the signals do not directly<br>
relate to the present invention, so they will not be further described below.<br>
When the signals transmitted from a j transmission antenna are detected,<br>
data transmitted during a kth interval can be represented as a vector xk including<br>
NT elements and data received during the kth interval can be represented as a<br>
vector yk including NR elements. In addition, if a fading channel value is an NRx<br>
NT matrix (Hk) and noise is a vector Nk including NR elements, the reception data<br>
yk are represented as shown in Equation (2).<br><br>
If a plurality of bits (b1j, b2j-,..., b13j) form a signal Xj transmitted from a jth<br>
antenna through NT signal mapping units, an LLR (log likelihood ratio) of the<br><br><br>
A detection value of the ith bit (bij) transmitted to the jth antenna is de-<br>
interleaved through a de-interleaver of an interleaver used in the jth antenna in<br>
step 1104. Besides the detection value of the ith bit (b'j) transmitted to the jth<br>
antenna, detection values of data transmitted from other transmission antennas are<br>
also de-interleaved.<br>
The data passing through the NR antenna de-interleavers is input into the<br>
parallel/serial converter such that parallel data is converted into serial data in step<br>
1106. An output value of the parallel/serial converter is subject to a first variable<br>
node decoding according to a predetermined lifting scheme, which may vary<br>
depending on the number of the transmission antennas in step 1108.<br>
After the variable node coding has been performed, it is determined if a<br>
decoding abort condition is satisfied in step 1110. If the decoding abort condition<br>
is satisfied, a hard decision of output data of the variable node decoder is<br>
performed to stop the decoding in step 1114.<br>
In addition, the decoding abort condition can be set in match with<br>
iterative decoding times. That is, it is possible to stop the decoding procedure<br>
after performing the decoding procedure by predetermined times. In addition, the<br>
decoding abort condition can be set in match with other conditions. In this case,<br>
the decoding procedure will be stopped if a predetermined value of the other<br>
conditions is represented.<br>
If the decoding abort condition is not satisfied in step 1110, the data is<br>
interleaved by the interleaver, under the control of the control unit, based on the<br>
parity check matrix stored in a memory in step 1112. Output data of the<br>
interleaver is subject to the check node decoding according to a predetermined<br>
lifting scheme, which may vary depending on the number of the transmission<br>
antennas in step 1116.<br><br>
In step 1118, the data used for the check node decoding pass through a<br>
de-interleaver under the control of the control unit based on the parity check<br>
matrix stored in the memory.<br>
The de-interleaved data is subject to a second variable node decoding<br>
through the above lifting schemes in step 1120. A variable node decoding value is<br>
converted into a parallel value through a serial/parallel converter in step 1122 and<br>
input into the detector in step 1102, after being subject to the NT antenna<br>
interleaving in step 1124.<br>
Accordingly, the decoding procedure is repeatedly performed so that the<br>
reception signal can be precisely decoded. After the first variable node decoding<br>
step, the hard decision of decoded signal is made by taking the decoding abort<br>
condition into consideration, thereby finally outputting the decoded signal.<br>
In the above decoding procedure, the antenna de-interleaving, antenna<br>
interleaving, variable node decoding, and check node decoding steps are<br>
performed according to the lifting LDPC code of the present invention. That is,<br>
the antenna de-interleaving, antenna interleaving, variable node decoding, and<br>
check node decoding steps are performed in accordance with the LDPC code<br>
lifted according to the number of the transmission antennas.<br>
Because the signals transmitted from the transmission antennas and<br>
detected from signals received in the reception antennas of the decoder have high<br>
correlation with each other, the decoding can be effectively performed even if<br>
channel environments of the signals transmitted from the transmission antennas<br>
are different from each other.<br>
FIG. 12 is a block diagram illustrating a space-time decoder utilizing a<br>
lifting low density parity check code according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention. Referring to FIG. 12, the lifting LDPC space-time decoder includes NR<br>
multiple reception antennas 1200 to 1202, a detector 1204, NR antenna de-<br>
interleavers 1206 to 1208, a parallel/serial converter 1210, a first variable node<br>
coder 1212, a second variable node coder 1224, a check node decoder 1220, an<br><br>
interleaver 1214, a de-interleaver 1222, a serial/parallel converter 1226, and a<br>
hard decision unit 1234. In addition, a memory 1216, an interleaver controller<br>
1218 and a lifting controller 1232 are provided in order to perform the lifting<br>
LDPC space-time decoding according to the present invention.<br>
Further, antenna interleavers 1228 to 1230 and antenna de-interleavers<br>
1206 to 1208 may process the transmission signals of each transmission antenna.<br>
Preferably, the number of the antenna interleavers 1228 to 1230 and antenna de-<br>
interleavers 1206 to 1208 is equal to the number of the transmission antennas.<br>
The memory 1216 stores the parity check matrix of the LDPC code<br>
before the lifting, and the interleaver controller 1218 controls the interleaver 1214<br>
and the de-interleaver 1222 using the parity check matrix stored in the memory<br>
1216. In addition, the lifting controller 1232 controls the variable node decoders<br>
1212 and 1214 and the check node decoder 1220 according to a predetermined<br>
lifting scheme, which may vary corresponding to variation of the number of the<br>
transmission antennas.<br>
As described above, each of the multiple reception antennas 1200 to 1202<br>
can receive all signals transmitted from multiple transmission antennas. That is,<br>
the first multiple reception antenna 1200 can receive all signals transmitted from<br>
the NT transmission antennas 1010 to 1012 illustrated in FIG. 10 and the NRth<br>
multiple reception antenna 1202 also receives all signals transmitted from the NT<br>
transmission antennas 1010 to 1012 illustrated in FIG. 10.<br>
The signals received in the reception antennas are input into the detector<br>
1204, and the detector 1204 detects the signals transmitted from the transmission<br>
antennas 1014 to 1016 based on the received signals and outputs data of the<br>
antenna interleavers 1228 to 1230 through the above mentioned detection scheme.<br>
Output data of the detector 1204 is input into the NT antenna de-interleavers 1206<br>
to 1208.<br>
The antenna de-interleaver 1206 corresponds to the antenna interleaver<br>
1006 illustrated in FIG. 10 and restores the interleaving data into original data.<br>
Output data of the antenna de-interleavers 1206 to 1208 is input into the<br><br>
parallel/serial converter 1210 such that serial data is output from the<br>
parallel/serial converter 1210. In addition, the output data of the parallel/serial<br>
converter 1210 is input into the first variable node decoder 1212. The first<br>
variable node decoder 1212 calculates a probability value of the signals input<br>
thereto and updates and outputs the probability value of the signals.<br>
The lifting controller 1232 controls the first variable node decoder 1212<br>
in such a manner that the first variable node decoder 1212 can perform the<br>
variable node decoding according to the number of the transmission antennas,<br>
based on information related to the transmission antennas. As described with<br>
reference to FIGS. 7A to 8B, one variable node and one check node are expanded<br>
into NT variable nodes and NT check nodes, respectively, according to the<br>
predetermined lifting scheme, while forming branches between the variable nodes<br>
and check nodes.<br>
The variable node coding of the first variable node decoder 1212 is<br>
performed based on the probability value of the signals transferred through the<br>
branch formed between the variable node and the check node. The probability<br>
value of the signals is transferred from the NT variable nodes to NT check nodes<br>
according to the predetermined lifting scheme.<br>
Output data of the first variable node decoder 1212 is input into the<br>
interleaver 1214. The output data passing through the interleaver 1214 decoded<br>
by means of the check node decoder 1220.<br>
The check node decoder 1220 updates and outputs the probability value<br>
of the signals according to a check node update rule. Similarly, the probability<br>
value of the signals transferred to the variable nodes from the check nodes can be<br>
obtained through the lifting scheme provided by the lifting controller 1232<br>
according to information of the transmission antennas.<br>
The output data of the check node decoder 1220 passes through the de-<br>
interleaver 1222 under the control of the interleaver controller 1218 based on the<br>
parity check matrix of the LDPC code stored in the memory 1216 and input into<br>
the second variable node decoder 1224. The second variable node decoder 1224<br><br>
calculates the probability value to be transferred to the detector 1204 according to<br>
the update rule based on the probability value transferred thereto from the from<br>
the check nodes.<br>
The variable node decoding is also performed using the second variable<br>
node decoder 1224 according to the lifting scheme in match with the number of<br>
the transmission antennas. Output data of the second variable node decoder 1224<br>
is output as parallel data through the serial/parallel converter 1226 and the<br>
parallel data is input into the NTantenna interleavers 1228 to 1230. The antenna<br>
interleavers 1228 to 1230 have functions identical to those of the antenna<br>
interleavers 1006 to 1008 illustrated in FIG. 10.<br>
The output data of the antenna interleavers 1228 and 1230 is again input<br>
into the detector for the purpose of the iterative decoding. By performing the<br>
iterative decoding through the above procedure, the lifting LDPC space-time<br>
decoding can be achieved with superior reliability. As described above, the<br>
iterative decoding is repeatedly performed. When the iterative decoding has been<br>
completed, the hard decision unit 1234 decides the hard decision of the output<br>
data of the variable node decoder 1212, and the final decoding signal is output.<br>
As described above, according to the present invention, the lifting LDPC<br>
code is used for the space-time coding in order to improve a relationship between<br>
bit arrays transmitted from the multiple antennas, thereby enabling data to be<br>
transmitted without an error. The received data can be precisely restored due to an<br>
effective antenna diversity, and superior reliability of data can be achieved.<br>
In addition, the present invention provides the space-time code having<br>
superior performance through a simple coding/decoding scheme. The present<br>
invention is adaptable for a system including a plurality of transmission/reception<br>
antennas.<br>
While the present invention has been shown and described with reference<br>
to certain preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in<br>
the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the<br><br>
