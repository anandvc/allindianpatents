TREATMENT OF GAS FROM AN IN SITU CONVERSION PROCESS<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to methods and systems for prodreing hydrogen, methane, and/or other products &amp;om various subsurface formations such as hydrocarbon containing formations.<br>
2.	Description of Related Art<br>
Hydrocarbons obtained from subterranean formations are often used as energy resources, as feedstocks, and as consumer products. Concerns over depletion of available hydrocarbon resources and concerns over declining overall quality of produced hydrocarbons have led to development of processes for more efficient recovery, processing and/or use of available hydrocarbon resources. In situ processes may be used to remove hydrocarbon materials from subterranean formations. Chernical and/or physical properties of hydrocarbon material in a subterranean formation may need to be changed to allow hydrocarbon material to be more easily removed from the subterranean formation. The chemical and physical changes may include in situ reactions that produce removable fluids, composition changes, solubility changes, density changes, phase changes, and/or viscosity changes of the hydrocarbon material in the formation. A fluid may be, but is not limited to, a gas, a liquid, an emulsion, a slurry, and/or a stream of solid particles that has flow characteristics similar to liquid flow.<br>
Formation fluids obtained from subterranean formations using an in situ conversion process may be sold and/or processed to produce commercial products. For example, methane may be produced from a hydrocarbon containing formation using an in situ conversion process. The methane may be sold or used as a fuel, or the methane may be sold or used as a feedstock to produce other chemicals. The formation fluids produced by an in situ conversion process may have different properties and/or compositions than formation fluids obtained through conventional production processes. Formation fluids obtained from subterranean formations using an in situ conversion process may not meet industry standards for transportation and/or commercial use. Thus, there is a need for irnproved methods and systems for treatment of formation fluids obtained from various hydrocarbon containing formations.<br>

DETAILEP DESCRIPTION<br>
The following description generally relates to systems and meflKxk for treating formation fluid produced fi-om a hydrocarbon containing formation using an in situ conversion process. Hydrocaxbon containing formations may be treated to yield hydrocarbon products, hydrogen, methane, and ottier products.<br>
"Hydrocarbons" are generally defined as molecules formed primarily by carbon and hydrogen atoms. Hydrocarbons may also include other elements such as, but not limited to, halogens, metallic elements, nitrogen, oxygen, and/or sulfur. Hydrocarbons may be, but are not limited to, kerogen, bitumen, pyrobitumen, oils, natural mineral waxes, and asphaltites. Hydrocarbons may be located in or adjacent to mineral matrices in the earth. Matrices may include, but are not limited to, sedimentary rock, sands, silicilytes, carbonates, diatondtes, and other porous media. "Hydrocarbon fluids'* are fluids that include hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbon fluids may include, entrain, or be entrained in non-hydrocarbon fluids such as hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, water, and ammonia.<br>
A "formation" includes one or more hydrocarbon containing layers, one or more non-hydrocarbon layers, an overburden, and/or an underburden. The "overburden" and/or the "underburden" include one or more different types of impermeable materials. For exanple, overburden and/or underburden may include rock, shale, mudstone, or wet'tigbt carbonate. In some embodiments of in situ conversion processes, the overburden and/or the<br><br>
underburden may include a hydrocarbon containing layer or hydrocarbon containing layers that are relatively impermeable and are not subjected to tenqueratures during in situ conversion processing that result in significant characteristic changes of the hydrocarbon containing layers of the overburden and/or the underburden. For cxsanple, the underburden may contain shale or mudstone, but the imderburden is not allowed to heat to pyrolysis temperatures during the in situ conversion process. In some cases, the overburden and/or the undeiburden may be somewhat permeable.<br>
Fonnation fluids' refer to fluids present in a formation and may include pyrolyzation fluid, synthesis gas, mobilized hydrocarbon, and water (steam). Formation fluids may include hydrocarbon fluids as well as non-hydrocarbon fluids. The term 'mobilized fluid" refers to fluids in a hydrocarbon containing formation that are able to flow as a result of thermal treatment of the formation. 'Troduced fluids" refer to formation fluids removed from the formation.<br>
An "in situ conversion process" refers to a process of heating a hydrocarbon containing formation from heat sources to raise the temperature of at least a portion of the formation above a pyrolysis tenperature so that pyrolyzation fluid is produced in the formation.<br>
'Carbon number" refers to the number of carbon atoms in a molecule. A hydrocarbon fluid may include various hydrocarbons with different carbon numbers. The hydrocarbon fluid may be described by a carbon nuniber distribution. Carbon numbers and/or caxbon number distributions may be detennined by true boiling point distribution and/or gas-liquid chromatography.<br>
A "heat source" is any system for providing heat to at least a portion of a formation substantially by conductive and/or radiative heat transfer. For example, a heat source may include electric heaters such as an insulated conductor, an elongated member, and/or a conductor disposed in a conduit A heat source may also include systems that generate heat by burning a fuel external to or in a formation. The systems may be sur&amp;ce burners, downhole gas burners, flameless distributed combustors, and natural distributed combustors. In some embodiments, heat provided to or generated in one or more heat sources may be supplied by other sources of energy. The other sources of energy may directly heat a formation, or the energy may be applied to a transfer medium that directly or indirectly heats the formation. It is to be understood that one or more heat sources that are applying heat to a formation may use different sources of energy. Thus, for exan^le, for a given formation some heat sources may supply heat firom electric resistance heaters, some heat soiu'ces may provide heat fix&gt;m combustion, and some heat sources may provide heat from one or more other ^lergy sources (for exan^le, chenoical reactions, solar energy, wind energy, biomass, or other sources of renewable energy). A chemical reaction may include an exothermic reaction (for exanple, an oxidation reaction). A heat source may also include a heater that provides heat to a zone proximate and/or surroimding a heating location such as a heater well<br>
A "heater" is any system or heat source for generating heat in a well or a near wellbore region. Heaters may be, but are not limited to, electric heaters, burners, combustors that react with material in or produced from a formation, and/or combinations hereof.<br>
An "in situ conversion process" refers to a process of heating a hydrocarbon containing formation firom heat sources to raise the temperature of at least a portion of the formation above a pyrolysis temperature so that pyrolyzation fluid is produced in the formation<br>
The term "wellbore" refers to a hole in a formation made by drilling or insertion of a conduit into the fonnation. A wellbore may have a substantially circular cross section, or another cross-sectional shape. As used<br><br><br><br>
are used to from a barrier around a treatmerarea. The barrier inhibits fluid flow into and/or out of the treatment area. Barrier wells include, but are not limited to, dewatering wells, vacuum wells, capture wells, injection wells, grout wells, freeze wells, or combinations thereof. In some einbodiments, barrier wells 208 are dewatering wells. Dewatering wells may remove liquid water and/or inhibit liquid water from entering a portion of the formation to be heated, or to the formation being heated. In the embodiment depicted in FIG. 1, the barrier wells 208 are shown extending only along one side of heat sources 210, but the barrier wells typically encircle all heat sources 210 used, or to be used, to heat a treatment area of the formation.<br>
Heat sources 210 are placed in at least a portion of the formation. Heat sources 210 may include heaters such as insulated conductors, conductor-in-conduit heaters, surface bumers, flameless distributed combtistors, and/or natural distributed cornbustors. Heat sources 210 may also include other types of heaters. Heat sources 210 provide heat to at least a portion of the formation to beat hydrocarbons in the fomaation. Hydrocarbons in the formation may be pyrolyzed to form formation fluid. Energy may be supplied to heat sources 210 through supply lines 212. Siq&gt;ply lines 212 may be structurally different depending on the type of heat source or heat sources used to heat the formation. Supply lines 212 for heat sources may transmit electricity for electric heaters, may transport fuel for cornbustors, or may transport heat exchange fluid that is circulated in the formation.<br>
Production wells 214 are used to remove formation fluid from the formation. In some embodiments, production well 214 may include one or more heat sources. A heat source in the production well may heat one or more portions of the formation at or near the production well.  A heat source in a production well may inhibit condensation and reflux of formation fluid being removed from the formation.<br>
Formation fluid produced from production wells 214 maybe transported through collection pq&gt;ing 216 to treatment facilities 218. Formation fluids may also be produced from heat sources 210. For exarx^le, fluid may be produced from heat sources 210 to control pressure in the formation adjacent to the heat sources. Fluid produced from heat sources 210 naay be transported through tubing or piping to collection piping 216 or the produced fluid may be transported through tubing or piping direcfly to treatment facilities 218. Treatment facilities 218 may include separation units, reaction units, upgrading units, fuel cells, turbines, storage vessels, and/or other systems and units for processing produced formation fluids. The treatment facilities may form transportation fuel from at least a portion of the hydrocarbons produced from the formation.<br>
In some enibodiments, formation fluid produced from the in situ conversion process is sent to a separator to split the formation fluid into one or more in situ conversion process liquid streams and/or one or more in situ conversion process gas streams. The liquid streams and the gas streams may be further treated to yield desired products.<br>
In some embodiments, in situ process conversion gas is treated at the site of the formation to produce hydrogen. Treatment processes to produce hydrogen from the in situ process conversion gas may include steam methane reforming, autothermal reforming and/or partial oxidation reforming.<br>
All or at least a portion of a gas stream may be treated to yield a gas that meets natural gas pipeline specifications. FIGS. 2,3,4,5, and 6 depict schematic representations of embodiments of systems for producing pipeline gas from the in situ conversion process gas stream.<br>
As depicted in FIG. 2, formation fluid 220 enters gas/liquid separation unit 222 and is separated into in situ conversion process liquid stream 224, in situ conversion process gas 226, and aqueous stream 228. In situ conversion process gas 226 enters unit 230. In unit 230, treatment of in situ conversion process gas 226 removes sulfur compounds, carbon dioxide, and/or hydrogen to produce gas stream 232. Unit 230 may include a physical<br><br>
treatmeat system and/or a chemical treatment system. The physical treatment system includes, but is not limited to, a membrane unit; a pressure swing adsorption unit, a liquid absorption unit, and/or a cryogenic unit The chemical treatment system may include units that use amines (for example, diethanolamine or di-isopropanolamine), zinc oxide, sulfolane, water, or mixtures thereof in the treatment process. In some embodiments, unit 230 uses a Sulfinol gas treatment process for removal of sulfur confounds. Carbon dioxide may be removed using Catacarb® (Catacarb, Overland Park, Kansas, U.S A.) and/or Benfield (UOP, Des Plaines, Illinois, U.S A.) gas treatment processes.<br>
Gas stream 232 may include, but is not limited to, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, methane, and hydrocarbons having a carbon number of at least 2 or mixtures thereof In some embodiments, gas stream 232 includes nitrogen and/or rare gases such as argon or helium. In some embodiments, gas stream 232 includes from0.0001 grams (g) to 0*1 g, from0.001 g to O.OS g, or from0.01 g to 0.03 g of hydrogen, per gram of gas stream. In certain enibodiinents, gas stream 232 includes from 0.01 g to 0.6 g, from 0.1 g to 0.5 g, or from 0.2 g to 0.4 g of methane, per gram of gas stream.<br>
In some embodiments, gas stream 232 mchides from0.00001 g to 0.01 g, from 0.0005 g to 0.005 g, or from 0.0001 g to 0.001 g of carbon monoxide, per gram of gas stream. In certain enibodiments, gas stream 232 includes trace amounts of carbon dioxide.<br>
In certain embodiments, gas stream 232 may include from0.0001 g to 0.5 g, from 0.001 g to 0.2 g, or from 0.01 g to 0.1 g of hydrocarbons having a carbon number of at least 2, per gram of gas stream. Hydrocarbons having a carbon number of at least 2 include paraffins and olefins. Paraffins and olefins include, but are not limited to, ethane, ethylene, acetylene, propane, propylene, butanes, butylenes, or mixtures thereof In some embodiments, hydrocarbons having a carbon immber of at least 2 include from 0.0001 g to 0.5 g, from 0.001 g to 0.2 g, or from 0.01 gtoO.l g of a mixture of ethylene, ethane, and propylene. In some emtbodiments, hydrocarbons having a carbon number of at least 2 includes trace amounts of hydrocarbons having a carbon number of at least 4.<br>
Pipelii]ie gas (for example, natural gas) after treatment to remove the hydrogen sulfide, mcludes methane, ethane, propane, butane, carbon dioxide, oxygen, nitrogen, and small ansounts of rare gases. Typically, treated natural gas includes, per gram of natural gas, 0.7 g to 0.98 g of methane; 0.0001 g to 0.2 g or from 0.001 g to 0.05 g of a mixture of ethane, propane, and butane; 0.0001 g to 0.8 g or from 0.001 g to 0.02 g of carbon dioxide; 0.00001 g to 0.02 g or from 0.0001 to 0.002 of oxygen; trace amounts of rare gases; and the balance being nitrogen. Such treated natural gas has a heat content of 40 MJ/Nm3 to 50 MJ/Nm3.<br>
Since gas stream 232 differs in composition from treated natural gas, gas stream 232 may not meet pipeline gas requirements. Emissions generated during burning of gas stream 232 may be unacceptable and/or not meet regulatory standards if the gas stream is to be used as a fuel. Gas stream 232 may include components or amounts of compoments that make the gas stream undesirable for use as a feed stream for making additional products.<br>
In some embodiments, hydrocarbons having a carbon number greater than 2 are separated from gas stream 232. These hydrocarbons may be separated using cryogenic processes, adsorption processes, and/or membrane processes. Removal of hydrocarbons having a carbon number greater than 2 from gas stream 232 may &amp;cilitate and/or enhance further processing of the gas stream.<br>
Process units as described herein may be operated at the following temperatures, pressures, hydrogen source flows, and gas stream flows, or operated otherwise as known m the art Temperatures may range from 50 X to 600 °C, from 100 °C to 500 °C, or from 200 X to 400 °C. Pressures may range from 0.1 MPa to 20 MPa, fix)m 1 MPa to 12 MPa, from 4 MPa to 10 MPa, or fix)m 6 MPa to 8 MPa. Flows of gas streams through units described<br><br>
herein may range from 5 metric tons of gas stream per day ('MT/D") to 15,000 MT/D. In some embodiments, flows of gas streams through units described herein range from 10 MT/D to 10,000 MT/D or from 15 MT/D to 5,000 MT/D. In some embodiments, the hourly volume of gas processed is 5,000 to 25,000 times the volume of catalyst in one or more processing units.<br>
As depicted in FIG. 2, gas stream 232 and hydrogen source 234 enter hydrogenation unit 236. Hydrogen source 234 includes, but is not limited to, hydrogen gas, hydrocarbons, and/or any confound capable of donating a hydrogen atom. In some embodiments, hydrogen source 234 is mixed with gas stream 232 prior to entering hydrogenation unit 236. In some embodiments, the hydrogen source is hydrogen and/or hydrocarbons present in gas stream 232. In hydrogenation unit 236, contact of gas stream 232 with hydrogen source 234 in the presence of one or more catalysts hydrogenates unsaturated hydrocarbons in gas stream 232 and produces gas stream 238. Gas stream 238 may include hydrogen and saturated hydrocarbons such as methane, ethane, and propane. Hydrogenation unit 236 may include a knock-out pot The knock-out pot removes any heavy by-products 240 from the product gas stream.<br>
Gas stream 238 exits hydrogenation imit 236 and enters hydrogen separation unit 242. Hydrogen separation unit 242 is any suitable unit capable of separating hydrogen from the incoming gas stream. Hydrogen separation unit 242 may be a membrane unit, a pressure swing adsorption unit, a liquid absorption unit, or a cryogenic unit In certain embodiments, hydrogen separation unit 242 is a membrane unit Hydrogen separation imit 242 may include PRISM® membranes available from Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (Allentown, Pennsylvania, U.S A.). The membrane separation unit may be operated at a ten:q)erature ranging from 50 °C to 80 °C (for examples, at a tenq&gt;erature of 66 °C). In hydrogen separation unit 242, separation of hydrogen from gas stream 238 produces hydrogen rich stream 244 and gas stream 246. Hydrogen rich stream 244 may be used in other processes, or, in some embodiments, as hydrogen source 234 for hydrogenation unit 236.<br>
In some embodiments, hydrogen separation unit 242 is a cryogenic unit When hydrogen separation unit 242 is a cryogenic unit, gas stream 238 may be separated into a hydrogen rich stream, a methane rich stream, and/or a gas stream that contains components having a boiling point greater tiban or equal to the boiling point of ethane.<br>
hi some enibodiments, hydrogen content in gas stream 246 is acceptable and further separation of hydrogen from gas stream 246 is not-needed. When the hydrogen content in gas stream 246 is acceptable, the gas stream may be suitable for use as pipeline gas.<br>
Further removal of hydrogen from gas stream 246 may be desired. In some embodiments, hydrogen is separated from gas stream 246 using a membrane. An example of a hydrogen separation membrane is described in U.S. Patent No. 6,821,501 to Matzakos et aL<br>
In some embodiments, a method of removing hydrogen from gas stream 246 includes converting hydrogen to water. Gas stream 246 exits hydrogen separation unit 242 and enters oxidation unit 248, as shown in FIG. 2. Oxidation source 250 also enters oxidation unit 248. In oxidation imit 248, contact of gas stream 246 with oxidation source 250 produces gas stream 252. Gas stream 252 may include water produced as a result of the oxidation. The oxidation source may include, but is not limited to, pure oxygen, air, or oxygen enriched air. Since air or oxygen enriched air includes nitrogen, monitoring the quantity of air or oxygen enriched air provided to oxidation unit 248 may be desired to ensure the product gas meets the desired pipeline specification for nitrogen. Oxidation unit 248 includes, in some embodiments, a catalyst Oxidation unit 248 is, in some embodiments, operated at a temperature in a range from 50 •=*€ to 500 °C, from 100 °C to 400 °C, or from 200 =°C to 300°C.<br><br>
Gas stream 252 exits oxidation unitt 248 and enters dehydration unit 254. In dehydration unit 254, separation of water fromgas stream 252 produces pipeline gas 256 and water 258. Dehydration unit 254 may be, for example, a standard gas plant glycol dehydration unit and/or molecular sieves. In some embodiments, a change in the amount of methane in pipeline gas produced from an in situ conversion process gas is desired. The amount of methane in pipeline gas may be enhanced through removal of components and/or through chemical modijBcation of conponents in the in situ conversion process gas.<br>
FIG. 3 depicts a schematic representation of an embodiment to enhance the amount of methane in pg)eline gas though reformation and methanation of the in situ conversion process gas.<br>
Treatment of in situ conversion process gas as described herein produces gas stream 232. Gas stream 232, hydrogen source 234, and steam source 260 enter reforming unit 262. In some embodiments, gas stream 232, hydrogen source 234, and/or steam source 260 are mixed together prior to entering reforming unit 262. In some embodiments, gas stream 232 includes an acceptable amount of a hydrogen source, and thus external addition of hydrogen source 234 is not needed. In reforming unit 262, contact of gas stream 232 with hydrogen source 234 in the presence of one or more catalysts and steam source 260 produces gas stream 264. The catalysts and operating parameters may be selected such that reforming of methane in gas stream 232 is minimized. Gas stream 264 includes methane, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and/or hydrogen.
