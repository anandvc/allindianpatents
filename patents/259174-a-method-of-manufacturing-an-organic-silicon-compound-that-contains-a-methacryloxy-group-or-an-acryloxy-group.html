DESCRIPTION<br>
A METHOD OF MANUFACTURING AN ORGANIC SILICON COMPOUND THAT CONTAINS A METHACRYLOXY GROUP OR AN ACRYLOXY GROUP<br>
Technical Field [0001 ]       The present invention relates to a novel method of manufacturing an organic silicon compound that contains a methacryloxy group or an acryloxy group and that is widely used as a silane coupling agent and a polymerizable monomer.<br>
Background Art [0002]       Since under the effect of heat that is generated either during industrial-scale synthesis   or during purification by distillation, organic silicon compounds that contain methacryloxy groups or acryloxy groups are subject to spontaneous polymerization,   and selection of polymerization inhibitors for preventing the undesired spontaneous pdlymerization is a matter of great importance.<br>
[0003]       Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication [hereinafter referred to as Kokai] S62-283983 (equivalent to EP 0247501) discloses a manufacturing method where an aromatic sulfur compound represented by phenothiazine is used as an inhibitor during distillation and synthesis of an organic silane that contains methacryloxy and acryloxy groups. However, during purification by distillation, the phenothiazine is easily mixed with fractions, and since the final product is admixed with phenothiazine, it is subject to severe coloration.<br>
[0004]       Kokai H5-186478 (equivalent to EP 0520477) discloses inhibition of polymerization of an acryloxysilane and methacryloxy silane by adding to the composition an N,N- dialkylaminomethylene phenol. Kokai H5-230143 discloses a polymerization inhibitor having an active ingredient in the form of an isocyanuric acid hydroxybenzyl ester derivative, e.g., isocyanuric acid tris(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzyl) ester. Kokai H7-25907 discloses a polymerization inhibitor having an active ingredient in the form of a 2,6-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxymethylphenol. Although the last-mentioned polymerization inhibitors are relatively<br><br>
resistant to coloration when mixed with the final product, they are still unsuitable for production under conditions of high temperature and strong acidity inherent in an industrial manufacturing process.<br>
Disclosure of Invention [0005]       It is an object of the present invention to provide an efficient method for manufacturing a high-quality, coloration-resistant organic silicon compound that contains a<br>
methacryloxy group or an acryloxy group and inhibits spontaneous polymerization under conditions of high temperature and strong acidity inherent in an industrial manufacturing process.<br>
[0006]       The inventors herein have found that a high-quality organic silicon compound that contains a methacryloxy group or an acryloxy group can be produced without risk of coloration and without spontaneous polymerization, even under vigorous production conditions, if the manufacturing process is carried out with the use of a phenothiazine derivative having a molecular weight no less than 240.   Thus the inventors arrived at the present invention.<br>
[0007]       More specifically, the method of the invention for manufacturing ah organic silicon compound that contains a methacryloxy group or an acryloxy group consists of manufacturing or conducting purification by distillation the product either in the presence of a phenothiazine derivative having a molecular weight above at least 240.<br>
[0008]       The aforementioned phenothiazine derivative is a compound selected from the group consisting of the following: a phenothiazine substituted with alkyl having four or more carbon atoms, dibenzophenothiazine, phenothiazine substituted with acyl having 2 to 18 carbon atoms, N, N1 phenothiazine dimer, a compound represented by formula (1) given below:<br><br><br>
(where R1 is an aralkyl group having 7 to 18 carbon atoms, and R2 is selected from a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 18 carbon atoms, an aralkyl group having 7 to 18 carbon atoms, and an acyl group having 2 to 18 carbon atoms; "m" and "n" are integers from 0 to 2, and where the following condition is satisfied:   m + n &gt; 1), and a compound of the following formula (2):<br><br>
(where R is the same as defined above, R is either a hydrogen atom or is selected from the group consisting of an alkyL group having 1 to 18 carbon atoms, an aralkyl group having 7 to 18 carbon atoms, and an acyl group having 2 to 18 carbon atoms; R4 is either a hydrogen atom or is selected from an alkyl group having 1 to 18 carbon atoms or an acyl group having 2 to 18 carbon atoms; X is a group selected from a methylene group, a-methylmethylene group, and a-phenylmethylene group; and "r" is a number represented by ait average value between 1 and 5. Preferable phenothiazine derivatives of the aforementioned type are compounds selected from the group consisting of 3-(α-methylbenzyl) phenothiazine, l-(d-methylbenzyl) phenothiazine, 3.7-bis(a-methylbenzyl) phenothiazine, 3-(a,a-dimethylbenzyl) phenothiazine, 3,7-(a,a-dimethylbenzyl) phenothiazine, 10-acetylphenothiazine, and 3,3'-methylene-bis (phenothiazine).<br>
[0009]       The aforementioned organic silicon compound that contains a methacryloxy group or an acryloxy group can be represented by the following formula (3):<br>
CH2 = C (R5) COO - R6 - Si (R7)3.p (R8)p	(3)<br>
(where Rs is a hydrogen atom or a methyl group, Rs is a bivalent organic group, R7 is an alkyl group, and R is either a halogen atom or is selected from an alkoxy group or an , alkyloxyalkoxy group; and "p" is an integer from 1 to 3). Most preferable is the organic silicon compound of the aforementioned type, wherein R8 in formula (3) is a bromine atom or a chlorine atom.<br>
[0010]       Furthermore, a stable composition that contains the aforementioned methacryloxy- or acryloxy-containing organic silicon compound can be prepared by<br><br>
combining the aforementioned organic silicon compound with a phenothiazine derivative that has a molecular weight of 240 or greater and that is used in an amount sufficient for stabilizing the compound, and by subjecting the organic silicon compound to purification by distillation prior to use.<br>
[0011 ]       Since the method of the invention inhibits spontaneous polymerization under severe production conditions of high temperature and strong acidity inherent in an industrial<br>
manufacturing process and since purification by distillation completely removes the polymerization inhibitor which constitutes a source of coloration of the target product, it becomes possible to efficiently produce a high-quality, coloration-resistant organic silicon compound that contains a methacryloxy group or an acryloxy group.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention [0012]       Phenothiazine derivatives suitable for the purposes of the present invention may be comprised of known phenothiazine derivatives having molecular weights equal to or greater than 240, preferably greater than 300, and even more preferably, greater than 400.<br>
[0013]       Such phenothiazine derivatives may be exemplified by the following compounds: 3-t-butyl-phenothiazine, 3-t-amylphenothiazine, 10-t-butyl-phenothiazine, 3-(l, 1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl) phenothiazine, or similar phenothiazines substituted with alkyls having four or more carbon atoms; 1,2-benzophenothiazine, or similar benzophenothiazines; 1,2,6,7-benzophenothiazine, or similar benzophenothiazine; 1-acetylphenothiazine, 10-acetylphenothiazine, or similar diphenothiazines substituted with acyls having 2 to 18 carbon atoms; 10, lO'-diphenothiazine, l,r-dimethyl-10,10'-diphenothiazine, 2,2',6,6'-tetramethyl-lOjlO'-diphenothiazine, or similar N,N'-phenothiazine dimmers; a compound of following formula (1):<br><br>
and a compound of following formula (2):<br><br><br>
Most preferable from the viewpoint of availability is the compound of formula (1).<br>
[0014]        In the above formulae. R1 designates benzyl groups, a-methylbenzyl groups, a.a-dimethylbenzyl groups, or   similar aralkyl groups having 7 to 18 carbon atoms or 7 to 12 carbon atoms, a-methylbenzyl groups and a,a-dimethylbenzyl groups being preferable; groups designated by R1 may be the same or different.<br>
[0015]       R2 designates hydrogen atoms or groups selected from linear-chain or branch-chain alkyl groups having 1 to 18 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 5 carbon atoms, acetyl groups and aralkyl groups having 7 to 18 carbon atoms, preferably, 7 to 12 carbon atoms, and benzoyl groups or similar acyl groups having 2 to 18 carbon atoms, preferably, 2 to 7 carbon atoms.   Most preferable are hydrogen atoms or acetyl groups, especially, hydrogen atoms.<br>
[0016]       R3 designates hydrogen atoms or groups selected from linear-chain or branch-chain alkyl groups having 1 to 18 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 5 carbon atoms, acetyl groups and aralkyl groups having 7 to 18 carbon atoms, preferably, 7 to 12 carbon atoms, and benzoyl groups or similar acyl groups having 2 to 18 carbon atoms, preferably, 2 to 7 carbon atoms.   Preferable are hydrogen atoms, aralkyl groups having 7 to 12 carbon atoms, but most preferable are hydrogen atoms, benzyl groups,   a-methylbenzyl groups, a,a-dimethylbenzyl groups, and especially, hydrogen atoms.<br>
[0017]       R4 designates hydrogen atoms or groups selected from linear-chain or branch-chain alkyl groups and acetyl groups having 1 to 18 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 5 carbon atoms, and benzoyl groups or similar acyl groups having 2 to 18 carbon atoms, preferably, 2 to 7 carbon atoms. Preferable are hydrogen atoms or acetyl groups.<br><br>
[0018]       X designates a group selected from a methylene group, a-methylmethylene group, and a-phenylmethylene group; "m" and "n" are integers from 0 to 2 that satisfy the following condition: "(m + n) &gt; 1; "r" is a number represented by an average value of 1 to 5 and that preferably is in the range of 1 to 2, and even more preferably, in the range of 1 to 1.5.<br>
[0019]       The following are specific examples of preferable compound of formula (1): 3-<br>
(ot-methylbenzyl) phenothiazine, 1-(a-methylbenzyl) phenothiazine, 3,7-bis (oc-methylbenzyl) phenothiazine, 3-(a,a-dimethyIbenzyl) phenothiazine, and 3,7-bis (a,ct-dimethylbenzyl) phenothiazine.<br>
[0020]       Compounds of formula (2) may be exemplified by compounds of the formulae given below, where "r" is the same as defined above:<br><br><br><br>
[0021]       The aforementioned phenothiazine derivatives, even in small quantities, produce a sufficient effect on organic silicon compounds that contain methacryloxy or acryloxy groups. The best results are obtained when, in terms of a weight ratio, the phenothiazine derivative is mixed with the aforementioned organosilicon compound in an amount of 10 to 5000 ppm, preferably 100 to 2000 ppm.<br>
[0022]       The aforementioned phenothiazine derivatives are suitable for use in the manufacture of an organic silicon compound of below-given formula (3) that contains a methacryloxy group or an acryloxy group:<br>
CH2 = C (R5) COO - R6 - Si (R7)3.p (R8)p	(3),<br>
where R5 is a hydrogen atom or a methyl group, and R6 is a bivalent organic group, preferable of which are methylene, ethylene, propylene, butylenes, isobutylene, or similar alkylene groups;   R7 is an alkyl group, preferably, methyl group; and R8 is either a chlorine atom, bromine atom or a similar halogen atom or is selected from a methoxy group, ethoxy group, or a similar alkoxy group, or a methoxyethoxy group, ethoxymethoxy group, or a similar alkyloxyalkoxy group. Most preferable are methoxy groups, ethoxy groups, chlorine atoms, or bromine atoms, especially, chlorine atoms or bromine atoms. In the above formula, "p" is an integer from 1 to 3. The following are specific examples of the aforementioned<br><br>
organic silicon compounds: methacryloxymethyl trimethoxysilane, methacryloxypropyl trimethoxysilane, acryloxypropyl trimethoxysilane, methacryloxypropyl methyldimethoxysilane, methacryloxypropyl triethoxysilane, acryloxypropyl.triethoxysilane, methacryloxypropyl trichlorosilane, methacryloxypropyl methyldichlorosilane, methacryloxypropyl dimethylchlorosilane, methacryloxyisobutyl trimethoxysilane, and methacryloxyisobutyl trichlorosilane.<br>
,   [0023]        Methacryloxy- and acryloxy-containing organic silicon compounds, other than those mentioned above, may be exemplified by bis (methacryloxypropyl) tetramethyldisiloxane, methacryloxypropyl tris (trimethylsiloxy) siloxane, acryloxytrimethylsilane, methacryloxytrimethylsilane, methacryloxyphenyldimethylsilane, or the like.<br>
[0024]       The aforementioned phenothiazine derivatives can also efficiently inhibit spontaneous polymerization in organic silicon compounds of formula (3) that have methacryloxy or acryloxy groups where R8 in the above formula is a halogen atom. Since such a methacryloxy- or acryloxy-containing organic silicon compounds are strongly acidic and therefore are more readily subject to spontaneous polymerization, they have to be handled with caution.<br>
[0025]       The aforementioned phenothiazine derivatives can be easily and completely removed from a crude methacryloxy- or acryloxy-containing organic silicon compounds by distillation. The distillation operation can be carried out without the use of a distillation column, with the use of a distillation column, by distillation in vacuum, by thin-film distillation, or by any other known method of distillation. Any of the above distillation methods protects the methacryloxy- or aciyloxy-containing organic silicon compounds from mixing with phenothiazine derivatives, and thus prevents coloration of the target product. Furthermore, since the entire phenothiazine derivative remains in the reactor, polymerization is efficiently prevented also in the reactor that may create a problem during distillation.<br>
[0026]       The aforementioned phenothiazine derivative alone demonstrates sufficient polymerization inhibiting capacity, but, if necessary, it can be additionally combined with<br><br>
known polymerization inhibitors, such as hindered-phenol or amine-type polymerization inhibitors. In the case of distillation, in particular, in order to inhibit polymerization of a gaseous phase, it is recommended to combine the phenothiazine derivative of the invention with p-methoxyphenol, 2,6-di-t-butyl-4-methylphenol, or similar polymerization inhibitors that have boiling points under atmospheric pressure below 3 00°C.<br>
