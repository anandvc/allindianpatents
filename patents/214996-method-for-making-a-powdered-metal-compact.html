				<td>METHOD FOR MAKING A POWDERED METAL COMPACT<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to cutting tools having internal coolant channels<br>
and particularly to cutting tools, or detachable cutting heads for cutting tools, made<br>
by form pressing and sintering carbide powders.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In many metal working chip forming operations it is desirable to deliver<br>
a coolant directly to the working edge. The purpose of the coolant is not only to<br>
cool the working edge but also to assist in chip removal. The most straightforward<br>
and easiest to manufacture coolant channels are axially directed. This can be done<br>
by simply drilling a central bore, or two parallel axially directed bores in the tool.<br>
In drills, twisted or helical channels are also used. In drills with replaceable cutting<br>
inserts spaced at different radial distances from the axis of rotation it is desirable to<br>
direct the exit opening towards the cutting inserts. U.S. Pat. No. 5,676,499 there is<br>
described a process wherein straight holes are drilled at different radial distances in<br>
a cylindrical blank. The middle portion of the blank is then heated and twisted<br>
giving rise to spirally formed channels. At the end of the process exit channels are<br>
drilled at an angle to the centerline of the drill resulting in exit openings that are<br>
spaced at different radial distances from the centerline, in the vicinity of the cutting<br>
inserts.<br>
Another method for obtaining complex shaped coolant channels is to<br>
use a core such as copper or wax in a powder body and then sinter. The core can<br>
be of any desired shape. During the sintering operation, the core disappears into<br>
the pores of the powdered body by infiltration leaving a cavity of configuration<br>
corresponding to the shape of the core.<br>
All the prior art method involve multistage processes which are both<br>
time consuming and costly.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method for<br>
manufacturing cutting tools with coolant channels by form pressing and sintering<br>
carbide powders, whilst overcoming the above mentioned disadvantages.<br>
It is also an object of the present invention to provide a cutting tool<br>
which is manufactured by the method of the present invention.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention there is provided a method for<br>
producing a powdered metal compact in a punch and die assembly, the powdered<br>
metal compact having a bore, at least one recess and at least one aperture<br>
communicating between the bore and the at least one recess, the method<br>
comprising the steps of:<br>
(i) providing a top punch having a forward end with at least one first protruding<br>
member;<br>
(ii) providing a bottom punch having forward end with at least one second<br>
protruding member;<br>
(iii) positioning the top and bottom punches in a die with the forward end of the<br>
top punch facing the forward end of the bottom punch and with a metal powder<br>
therebetween;<br>
(iv) compacting the metal powder by pressing the top and bottom punches<br>
towards each other until the at least one first protruding member abuts the least one<br>
second protruding member at at least one region of contact, wherein the bore is<br>
formed by a volume of space delimited by the at least one second protruding<br>
member between the top and bottom punches and the at least one aperture is<br>
formed at the at least one region of contact; and<br>
(v) removing the top punch and ejecting the metal powder compact from the die.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment, the metal powder<br>
comprises a cemented carbide and a binder.<br>
Typically, the cemented carbide is tungsten carbide and the binder is<br>
cobalt.<br>
If desired, the method comprises an additional step of sintering the<br>
metal powder compact.<br>
In accordance with a specific application, the second protruding<br>
member is cylindrical, in the form of a rod.<br>
Further if desired, the method comprises a further additional step of<br>
grinding the sintered metal powder compact.<br>
Preferably, the further additional step of grinding produces cutting edges<br>
on a cutting portion of the metal powder compact.<br>
If desired, the further additional step of grinding also produces an<br>
external screw thread on a mounting portion of the metal powder compact<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Attention is first drawn to Fig. 1 shows a cutting head 10 for a metal<br>
cutting tool. Typically, the cutting tool comprises a tool shank (not shown) to<br>
which the cutting head 10 is secured. The cutting head has front and rear ends 12,<br>
14 and a longitudinal axis A passing there through. The cutting head 10 comprises<br>
a cutting portion 16 formed integrally with a mounting portion 18. The mounting<br>
portion 18 is provided with an external screw thread 20. An axially directed bore<br>
22, having a bore surface 24, extends from adjacent the front end 12 to the rear end<br>
14, opening out at the rear end 14 to a bore opening 26. The cutting portion 16 is<br>
provided with six cutting edges 28. Each cutting edge 28 is formed at the<br>
intersection of rake surface 30 and a relief surface 32. Adjacent each rake surface<br>
is a chip gullet 34. Adjacent the front end 12 of the cutting head 10 there is<br>
associated with each chip gullet 34 a wedge-like cutting head recess 36 opening out<br>
into the chip gullet 34 and into the front end 12 of the cutting head 10. At a radially<br>
innermost part of each cutting head recess 36 there is an aperture 38. The aperture<br>
38 is adjacent to, but axially rearwardly displaced from, the front end 12 of the<br>
cutting head 10. Each aperture 38 communicates between the cutting head recess<br>
36 and the bore 22 and geometrically coincides with the bore surface 24. The bore<br>
22 forms a coolant channel and therefore coolant fluid entering the bore 22 from<br>
the bore opening 26 will traverse the bore 22 axially and exit the bore 22 through<br>
the apertures 38. Hence the apertures 38 form exit openings of the bore 22 for<br>
distributing coolant fluid to the vicinity of the cutting edges 28.<br>
Each wedge-like cutting head recess 36 comprises an inner wall 40, two<br>
side walls 42 and a rear wall 44. The inner wall 40 extends from the aperture 38 to<br>
the front end 12 of the cutting head 10 and is flush with the aperture 38. The rear<br>
wall 44 extends between the two side walls 42 and also extends radially outwardly<br>
from the aperture 38. The side walls 42 extend axially from the rear wall 44 to the<br>
front end of the cutting head 10, and radially outwardly from the aperture 38 and<br>
the inner wall 40. The six wedge-like cutting head recess 36 divide the front end<br>
12 of the cutting head 10 into a symmetrical structure having six identical wedge-<br>
like cutting head protrusions 46, with a wedge-like cutting head recess 36 between<br>
each pair of adjacent cutting head protrusions 46. Each cutting head protrusion 46<br>
has a front surface 48 coinciding with the front end 12 of the cutting head 10.<br>
Since for each cutting head recess the aperture 38 geometrically coincides with the<br>
bore surface 24 and since the inner wall 40 extends from the aperture 38 to the<br>
front end 12 of the cutting head 10 and is flush with the aperture 38, therefore a<br>
circular region 50 is formed at the center of the front end of the cutting head 12.<br>
The circular region 50 has a diameter equal to the diameter of the bore 22.<br>
In accordance with the present invention the cutting head 10 is produced<br>
as an integral body from a powdered metal compact 52 by form pressing and<br>
sintering a metal powder. Attention is now drawn to Fig. 2, showing the powdered<br>
metal compact 52 obtained by form pressing and sintering a cemented carbide and<br>
a binder. Typically, the cemented carbide is tungsten carbide and the binder is<br>
cobalt. The cutting head 10 is obtained from the powdered metal compact 52 by<br>
suitably grinding the powdered metal compact 52 to produce the chip gullets 34,<br>
cutting edges 28 and associated features on the cutting portion 16 and the screw<br>
thread 20 on the mounting portion 18.<br>
The powdered metal compact 52 is produced with enlarged recesses 54,<br>
relative to the size of the cutting head recesses 36, at its front end 56. Each<br>
enlarged recess 54 comprises the inner wall 40 and aperture 38, identical to those of<br>
the cutting head recess 36 and enlarged side walls 58 and an enlarged rear wall 60<br>
similar to the side and rear walls 42, 44 of cutting head recess 36, the only<br>
difference being that the enlarged side and rear walls 58, 60 extend radially further<br>
than the side and rear walls 42, 44 of cutting head recess 36. Each aperture 38<br>
communicates between a given enlarged recess 54 and the bore 22. It will be<br>
appreciated by comparing Figs. 1 and 2 that due to the grinding of the chip gullets<br>
34, a radially outer section of the enlarged recesses 54 will be removed, whereby<br>
the cutting head recesses 36 will be obtained.<br>
Attention is now drawn to Figs. 3 to 5. A punch and die assembly 62<br>
comprises a top punch 64 and a bottom punch 66 located in a die 68. The bottom<br>
punch 66 has a forward end 70 comprising a central cylindrical rod 72 emanating<br>
from a cylindrical base 74 both of which are concentric with a cylindrical shell 76.<br>
The cylindrical shell 76 surrounds and abuts the cylindrical base 74 and overlaps a<br>
lower part of the rod 72. The, region of overlap 78 between the cylindrical shell 76<br>
and the rod 72 defines the geometry of the mounting portion 18, before grinding.<br>
The top punch 64 has a forward end 80 comprising six spaced apart wedge like top<br>
punch protrusions 82 separated by top punch recesses 84. The top punch<br>
protrusions 82 and the rod 72 form, respectively, first and second protruding<br>
members. The geometry of the forward end 80 of the top punch 64 is the negative<br>
of the geometry of the front end 56 of the powdered metal compact 52. Hence,<br>
when pressing a metal powder between the top and bottom punches, the top punch<br>
protrusions 82 will form in the powdered metal compact 52 the enlarged recesses<br>
54, the top punch recesses 84 will form in the powdered metal compact 52 the<br>
wedge-like cutting head protrusions 46. A central circular recess 86 in the top<br>
punch 64 together with the rod 72 will form the circular region 50 at the center of<br>
the front end 12 of the powdered metal compact 52. As shown in Fig. 5, the rod 72<br>
is located in the central circular recess 86 in the top punch during the pressing of<br>
the metal powder. The diameter of the rod 72 is only slightly smaller than the<br>
diameter of the central circular recess 86 by generally less than one hundredth of a<br>
millimeter and preferably less than about five thousandths of a millimeter. This<br>
ensures, on the one hand that the rod 72 can enter the central circular recess 86 and<br>
on the other that the top punch protrusions 82 will abut the rod 72. In Fig. 4, a line<br>
88 has been drawn on an inner surface 90 of the top punch protrusions 82 to mark<br>
the depth of penetration of the rod 72 into the central circular recess 86. If the<br>
depth of penetration is h and the total depth of the central circular recess 86 is H,<br>
then the axial height of the aperture 38 will be h and the axial thickness of the<br>
circular region 50 at the enter of the front end of the powdered metal compact 52<br>
will be H-h. The region of contact 92 between the rod 72 and the inner surface 90<br>
of a given top punch protrusion 82 is the region between the marked line 88 and the<br>
forward end 80 of the top punch 64. The regions of contact 92 define and create the<br>
apertures 38 and the volume of space delimited by the rod 72 between the top and<br>
bottom punches 64, 66 defines and creates the bore 22. It will be apparent that one<br>
or both of the contacting surfaces may be concave in the region of contact. In such<br>
a case, instead of a region of contact there will be an equivalent closed line of<br>
contact, that will define the aperture.<br>
A straightforward method for producing a cutting head 10 for a cutting<br>
tool has been described. The method involves using a bottom punch 66 having a<br>
protruding rod 72 that creates the bore (coolant channel) 22. A typical aperture<br>
(exit opening for the coolant channel) 38 is formed by designing the pressing<br>
process in such a way that when the metal powder is compacted a region of contact<br>
is created between the rod 72 and the top punch 60. This region of contact will be<br>
the typical aperture 38. In other words, a cutting head 10 for a cutting tool can be<br>
produced with a coolant channel 22 with exit openings 38 by simply form pressing<br>
a metal powder without the use of any ancillary means.<br>
It will be noted that the top punch 64 comprises a first top punch<br>
member 64" and a second top punch member 64". The second top punch member<br>
64" is connected to a push rod 64"" which can move freely through a central region<br>
of the first top punch member 64". This is for convenience in order to remove any<br>
compacted powder that by chance becomes lodged in the top punch recesses 84.<br>
Although the present invention has been described to a certain degree of<br>
particularity., it should be understood that various alterations and modifications can<br>
be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as hereinafter<br>
claimed.<br>
