The present invention relates to a process for converting olefinic C4-hydrocarbons, for example from steam crackers or FCC plants, into pentenes and hexenes by means of a metathesis reaction. Propene is obtained as desired process coproduct.<br>
Olefinic metathesis (disproportionation) describes, in its simplest form, the reversible, metal-catalyzed transalkylidenation of olefins by rupture and reformation of C=C double bonds in accordance with the following equation:<br><br>
In the special case of the metathesis of acyclic olefins, a distinction is made between self-metathesis in which one olefin is transformed into a mixture of two olefins of differing molar mass (for example: propene -» ethene + 2-butene) and cross-metathesis or co-metathesis which describes the reaction of two different olefins (propene + 1-butene -&gt; ethene + 2-pentene). If one of the reactants is ethene, this is generally referred to as an ethenolysis.<br>
Suitable metathesis catalysts are, in principle, homogeneous and heterogeneous transition metal compounds, in particular from transition groups VI to VIII of the Periodic Table of the Elements, and also homogeneous and heterogeneous catalyst systems in which these compounds are present.<br>
Various metathesis processes starting from C4 streams have been described.<br>
US 5,057,638 relates to a process for preparing 1-hexene, comprising the process steps:<br><br>
a)	metathesis of 1 -butene to give a mixture of 3-hexene and ethene,<br>
b)	separation of the 3-hexene from the product mixture obtained in step a),<br>
c)	reaction of the 3-hexene with an electrophile containing reactive hydrogen, preferably derived from water or carboxylic acid, under acid conditions which allow the addition of the electrophilic components onto the C=C bond (e.g. hydration), and<br>
d)	cracking of the product from step c), e.g. by dehydration, to prepare a mixture of n-hexenes in which 1-hexene is present in economically acceptable amounts.<br>
US 69-821945 (May 5, 1969), Gulf Res. &amp; Dev.Co. describes the conversion of short-chain GrCi2-olefins (preferably a-olefins) into higher olefins by metathesis. The process comprises bringing the starting olefin into contact with a catalyst comprising aluminum, molybdenum or rhenium and silver or copper at from 100 to 240°C, with relatively low-boiling by-products, e.g. ethene, being able to be removed from the equilibrium in situ.<br>
The present invention further relates to a combined process for preparing C5/C6-olefins together with propene as secondary product from C4 fractions from steam crackers or FCC plants.<br>
Steam crackers represent the main source of basic petrochemicals, for example ethene, propene, C4olefins and higher hydrocarbons. In the cracking process, it is necessary to introduce large amounts of energy at high temperatures within a time which is sufficient for cracking to occur but does not allow further reaction of the cracking products. In the cracking of hydrocarbons, the yield of ethene and propene is therefore determined essentially by<br>
•	the type of hydrocarbons used (naphtha, ethane, LPG, gas oil, or the like),<br>
•	the cracking temperature,<br>
•	the residence time<br>
•	and the partial pressures of the respective hydrocarbons.<br>
The highest yield of ethene and propene is achieved at cracking temperatures of from 800 to 850°C and residence times of from 0.2 to 0.5 s. In this range the main<br><br>
product is always ethene, and the C3/C2 product ratio can be increased from about 0.5 to 0.7 by slight variation in the cracking conditions. The world-wide demand for propene is increasing more rapidly than that for ethene. This has the consequence, inter alia, that processes for downstream utilization of the higher hydrocarbons formed in the cracking process, e.g. C4-hyrocarbons, are gaining increasing importance in respect of the optimization of the propene yield.<br>
It is an object of the present invention, in the context of work on improving the value added derived from steam cracker by-products, to develop a flexibly controllable catalytic process for obtaining pure C5-/C6-oIefin streams from inexpensive olefin-containing C4-hydrocarbon mixtures without introduction of ethene.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by a process for preparing C5-/C6-olefins from an olefinic starting stream comprising C4-hydrocarbons, which comprises<br>
a)	carrying out a metathesis reaction in the presence of a metathesis catalyst comprising at least one compound of a metal of transition group VIb, Vllb or VIII of the Periodic Table of the Elements so as to convert the 1-butene, 2-butene and isobutene present in the starting stream into a mixture of C2-Ce-olefins and butanes,<br>
b)	firstly fractionating the resulting product stream by distillation to give a low boiler fraction A comprising C2-C4-olefms and butanes, which is discharged, and a high boiler fraction comprising C4-C6-olefins and butanes,<br>
c)	subsequently fractionating the high boiler fraction from b) by distillation to give a low boiler fraction B comprising butenes and butanes, an intermediate boiler fraction C comprising pentene and methylbutene and a high boiler fraction D comprising hexene and methylpentene,<br>
d)	where all or part of the fractions B and/or C are recirculated to the process step a) and the fraction D is discharged as product.<br><br>
The expression "comprising" allows for the presence of relatively small amounts of other hydrocarbons.<br>
In this process, carried out in a single stage, a fraction comprising Grolefins, preferably n-butenes, isobutene and butanes is converted over a homogeneous or preferably heterogeneous metathesis catalyst into a product mixture of (inert) butanes, unreacted 1-butene, 2-butene and possibly isobutene and also the metathesis products ethene, propene, 2-pentene, possibly 2-methyl-2-butene, 3-hexene and possibly 2-methyl-2-pentene in a metathesis reaction according to the following equation:<br><br>
The amount of branched C5- and C6-hydrocarbons in the metathesis product depends on the isobutene content of the C4 feed and is preferably kept as small as possible (
To explain the process of the present invention in its different variations in more detail, the above equilibrium reaction (without taking isobutene into account) will be divided into three important individual reactions:<br><br><br><br>
Depending on the prevailing demand for the target products propene, 2-pentene and 3-hexene (the term 2-pentene includes any isomers formed, e.g. cis/trans or 2-methyl-2-butene, and the same applies analogously to 3-hexene), the external mass balance of the process can be influenced in a targeted manner by shifting the equilibrium by recirculation of particular substreams. Thus, for example, the 3-hexene yield is increased when the cross-metathesis of 1-butene with 2-butene is suppressed by recirculation of 2-pentene into the metathesis step, so that very little, if any, 1-butene is consumed by the cross-metathesis. The self-metathesis of 1-butene to 3-hexene which then proceeds preferentially forms additional ethene which reacts in a subsequent reaction with 2-butene to form the desired product propene.<br>
Olefin mixtures comprising 1-butene, 2-butene and isobutene are obtained, inter alia, in various cracking processes such as steam cracking or FCC as C4 fraction. Alternatively, it is possible to use butene mixtures as are obtained in the dehydrogenation of butenes or by dimerization of ethene. Butanes present in the C4 fraction behave as inerts. Dienes, alkynes or enynes are removed before the metathesis step of the present invention by means of customary methods such as extraction or selective hydrogenation.<br><br>
The butene content of the C4 fraction used in the process is from 1 to 100% by weight, preferably from 60 to 90% by weight. The butene content refers to 1-butene, 2-butene and isobutene.<br>
Preference is given to using a C4 fraction as is obtained in steam cracking or FCC or in the dehydrogenation of butane.<br>
Raffinate I or II can be used as C4 fraction, and the C4 stream is freed of interfering impurities prior to the metathesis reaction by appropriate treatment over protective adsorber beds, preferably over high surface area aluminum oxides or molecular<br>
sieves.<br>
The low boiler fraction A obtained, in particular the C2/3 fraction, can be directly processed further as such, fed to the work-up sequence of a steam cracker or FCC plant in order to obtain pure ethene and propene, or recirculated completely or in part to the metathesis step in order to increase the yield of pentene/hexene, or be used separately for the isolation of ethene and propene as pure component (in particular as C2/3 fraction).<br>
The metathesis reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of heterogeneous, lot or only slightly isomerization-active metathesis catalysts selected from the :lass consisting of transition metal compounds of metals of groups VIb, Vllb and VIII of the Periodic Table of the Elements applied to inorganic supports.<br>
The preferred metathesis catalyst is rhenium oxide on a support, preferably on y-duminum oxide or on A^CVB^CVSiC^ mixed supports.<br>
&gt;articular preference is given to using Re2(Vy-Al203 having a rhenium oxide content of from 1 to 20%, preferably from 3 to 15%, particularly preferably from 6 o 12% (% by weight), as catalyst.<br>
n the case of a liquid-phase process, the metathesis is preferably carried out at rom 0 to 150°C, particularly preferably from 20 to 80°C, and a pressure of from 2 0 200 bar, particularly preferably from 5 to 30 bar.<br><br>
When the metathesis is carried out in the gas phase, the temperature is preterabiy from 20 to 300°C, particularly preferably from 50 to 200°C. The pressure in this case is preferably from 1 to 20 bar, particularly preferably from 1 to 5 bar.<br>
A further object of the invention, in the context of work on improving the value added to steam cracker by-products, is to develop a flexibly controllable process sequence of utilizing a C4 fraction. The objective is to add value by converting C4-olefins into higher-priced olefin fractions. Crude C4 fraction from steam crackers or FCC plants is available as feedstock.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by a process for preparing CsA^-olefins and propene from steam cracker or refinery C4 streams, comprising the substeps<br>
(1)	removal of butadiene and acetylenic compounds by, if desired, extracting<br>
butadiene with a butadiene-selective solvent and subsequently or alter<br>
natively selectively hydrogenating butadienes and acetylenic impurities<br>
present in the crude C4 fraction to give a reaction product comprising<br>
n-butenes and isobutene and essentially no butadienes and acetylenic<br>
compounds,<br>
(2)	removal of isobutene by reacting the reaction product from the preceding<br>
stage with an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to give an ether,<br>
and separating off the ether and the alcohol either simultaneously with or<br>
after the etherification to give a reaction product comprising n-butenes and<br>
possibly oxygen-containing impurities, where the ether formed can be dis<br>
charged or redissociated to obtain pure isobutene and the etherification step<br>
can be followed by a distillation step for separating off isobutene, where, if<br>
desired, introduced C3-, i-Ca- and Cs-hydrocarbons can be removed by<br>
distillation in the work-up of the ether, or oligomerizing or polymerizing<br>
isobutene from the reaction product from the preceding step in the presence<br>
of an acid catalyst whose acid strength is suitable for selectively separating<br>
off isobutene as oligoisobutene or polyisobutene to give a stream contain<br>
ing from 0 to 15% of residual isobutene,<br>
3)	removal of the oxygen-containing impurities from the product of the preceding steps over appropriately selected adsorber materials,<br>
4)	metathesis of the resulting raffinate II stream as described.<br><br>
The substep of selective hydrogenation of butadiene and acetylenic impurities present in the crude C4 fraction is preferably carried out in two stages by bringing the crude C4 fraction into contact with a catalyst comprising at least one metal selected from the group consisting of nickel, palladium and platinum on a support, preferably palladium on aluminum oxide, in the liquid phase at from 20 to 200°C, a pressure of from 1 to 50 bar, a volume flow of from 0.5 to 30 m3 of fresh feed per m3 of catalyst per hour and a ratio of recycle to feed stream of from 0 to 30 at a molar ratio of hydrogen to diolefms of from 0.5 to 50 to give a reaction product in which, apart from isobutene, the n-butenes 1-butene and 2-butene are present in a molar ratio of from 2:1 to 1:10, preferably from 2:1 to 1:2, and in which essentially no diolefms and acetylenic compounds are present.<br>
The substep of butadiene extraction from crude C4 fraction is preferably carried out using a butadiene-selective solvent selected from the class consisting of polar aprotic solvents such as acetone, furfural, acetonitrile, dimethylacetamide, di-methylformamide and N-methylpyrrolidone to give a reaction product in which the n-butenes 1-butene and 2-butene are present in a molar ratio of from 2:1 to 1:10, preferably from 2:1 to 1:2.<br>
The substep of isobutene etherification is preferably carried out in a three-stage reactor cascade using methanol or isobutanol, preferably isobutanol in the presence of an acid ion exchanger, in which the extraction mixture flows from the top downward through the flooded fixed-bed catalyst, where the reactor inlet temperature is from 0 to 60°C, preferably from 10 to 50°C, the outlet temperature is from 25 to 85°C, preferably from 35 to 75°C, the pressure is from 2 to 50 bar, preferably from 3 to 20 bar and the ratio of isobutanol to isobutene is from 0.8 to 2.0, preferably from 1.0 to 1.5, and the total conversion corresponds to the equilibrium conversion.<br>
The substep of isobutene removal is preferably carried out by oligomerization or polymerization of isobutene starting from the reaction product obtained from the above-described step of butadiene extraction and/or selective hydrogenation and in the presence of a catalyst selected from the class consisting of homogeneous and heterogeneous Bronsted acids, preferably heterogeneous catalysts comprising an oxide of a metal of transition group VIb of the Periodic Table of the Elements and<br><br>
an acidic inorganic support, preferably WC^TiCh, to produce a sircam uavmg a residual isobutene content of less than 15%.<br>
Selective hydrogenation of crude C4 fraction<br>
Alkynes, alkynenes and alkadienes are, owing to their tendency to polymerize or their pronounced tendency to form complexes with transition metals, undesirable substances in many industrial syntheses. They sometimes have a very strong adverse effect on the catalysts used in these reactions.<br>
The C4 stream from a steam cracker contains a high proportion of multiply unsaturated compounds such as 1.3-butadiene, 1-butyne (ethylacetylene) and butenine (vinylacetylene). Depending on the downstream processing, the multiply unsaturated compounds are either extracted (butadiene extraction) or selectively hydrogenated. In the former case, the residual content of multiply unsaturated compounds is typically from 0.05 to 0.3% by weight, while in the latter case it is typically from 0.1 to 4.0% by weight. Since the residual amounts of multiply unsaturated compounds likewise interfere in further processing, a further purification by selective hydrogenation to values of

Alternatively: extraction of butadiene from crude C4 fraction<br>
The preferred method of isolating butadiene is based on the physical principle of extractive distillation. Addition of selective organic solvents lowers the volatility of specific components of a mixture, in this case butadiene. These therefore remain<br><br>
together with the solvent in the bottoms from the distillation column, while the accompanying substances which could previously not be separated off by distillation can be removed at the top. The main solvents used for the extractive distillation are acetone, furfural, acetonitrile, dimethylacetamide, dimethyl-formamide (DMF) and N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP). Extractive distillations are particularly useful in the case of butadiene-rich C4 fractions having a relatively high proportion of alkynes, for instance methylacetylene, ethylacetylene and vinylacetylene, and also methylallene.<br>
The simplified principle of a solvent extraction of crude C4 fraction can be described as follows: the completely vaporized C4 fraction is fed in at the lower end of an extraction column. The solvent (DMF, NMP) flows downward from the top in countercurrent to the gas mixture and on its way down takes up the more readily soluble butadiene and small amounts of butenes. At the lower end of the extraction column, part of the pure butadiene isolated is introduced in order to strip out most of the butenes. The butenes leave the separation column at the top. In a further column, referred to as a degassing column, the butadiene is separated from the solvent by boiling and is subsequently distilled to recover it in pure form.<br>
The reaction product of an extractive butadiene distillation is usually fed to the second stage of a selective hydrogenation in order to reduce the residual butadiene content to values of 
The C4 steam remaining after removal of butadiene is referred to as C4 raffinate or raffinate I and comprises mainly the components isobutene, 1-butene, 2-butene and also n-butane and isobutane.<br>
Removal of isobutene from raffinate I<br>
In the further fractionation of the C4 stream, isobutene is then preferably isolated since it differs in terms of its branching and its higher reactivity from the remaining C4 components. One possibility is removal by means of shape-selective molecular sieves, which makes it possible to isolate isobutene having a purity of 99% and in which the n-butenes and butane adsorbed in the pores of the molecular sieve can be desorbed again by means of a relatively high-boiling hydrocarbon, but the separation is usually carried out by distillation using a deisobutenizer by means<br><br>
of which isobutene is separated off together with 1-butene and isobutene at the top and 2-butenes and n-butane including residual amounts of isobutene and 1-butene remain in the bottoms, or extractively by reaction of isobutene with alcohols over acid ion exchangers. In the latter method, preference is given to using methanol  MTBE) or isobutanol (IBTBE).<br>
The preparation of MTBE from methanol and isobutene is carried out at from 30 to 100°C and slightly super-atmospheric pressure in the liquid phase over acid ion exchangers. It is carried out either in two reactors or in a two-stage shaft reactor in order to achieve virtually quantitative isobutene conversion (&gt; 99%). Due to the pressure-dependent formation of a methanol/MTBE azeotrope, the isolation of pure MTBE requires the use of a multistage pressure distillation or is achieved using more recent technology involving methanol adsorption on adsorbent resins. All other components of the C4 fraction remain unchanged. Since small amounts of diolefins and acetylenes can shorten the life of the ion exchanger as a result of polymer formation, preference is given to using Afunctional Pd-containing ion exchangers over which only diolefins and acetylenes are hydrogenated in the presence of small amounts of hydrogen. This does not influence the etherification of the isobutene.<br>
MTBE is used first and foremost for increasing the octane number of gasoline. As an alternative, MTBE and IBTBE can be redissociated in the gas phase at from 150 to 300°C over acidic oxides to give pure isobutene.<br>
A further possible way of removing isobutene from raffinate I is the direct synthesis of oligoisobutene/polyisobutene. Isobutene conversions of up to 95% can be achieved in this way over acidic homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts, e.g. tungsten trioxide on titanium dioxide, to give a product stream having a residual isobutene content of not more than 5%.<br>
Feed purification of the raffinate II stream over adsorbent materials<br>
To improve the operating life of the catalysts used in the subsequent metathesis step, it is necessary, as described above, to use a feed purification step (guard bed) for removing catalyst poisons such as water, oxygen-containing compounds, sulfur or sulfur compounds or organic halides.<br><br>
Processes for adsorption and adsorptive purification are described, for example, in W. Kast, Adsorption aus der Gasphase, VCH, Weinheim (1988). The use of zeolitic adsorbents is described in D.W. Breck, Zeolite Molecular Sieves, Wiley, New York (1974).<br>
The removal of specifically acetaldehyde from C3-Ci5-hydrocarbons in the liquid phase can be carried out as described in EP-A-0 582 901.<br>
Selective hydrogenation of crude C4 fraction<br>
In a two-stage process, butadiene (1,2- and 1,3-butadiene) present in the crude C4 fraction from a steam cracker or a refinery is selectively hydrogenated first, after which alkynes or alkenynes present in the C4 fraction are selectively hydrogenated. The C4 stream from a refinery can also, in one embodiment, be fed directly to the second step of the selective hydrogenation.<br>
The first hydrogenation step is preferably carried out over a catalyst comprising from 0.1 to 0.5% by weight of palladium on aluminum oxide as support. The reaction is carried out in the gas/liquid phase in a fixed bed (downflow mode) using a liquid circuit. The hydrogenation is carried out at from 40 to 80°C and a pressure of from 10 to 30 bar, a molar ratio of hydrogen to butadiene of from 10 to 50 and an LHSV of up to 15 m3 of fresh feed per m3 of catalyst per hour and a ratio of recycle to feed stream of from 5 to 20.<br>
The second hydrogenation step is preferably carried out over a catalyst comprising from 0.1 to 0.5% by weight of palladium on aluminum oxide as support. The reaction is carried out in the gas/liquid phase in a fixed bed (down flow mode) using a liquid circuit. The hydrogenation is carried out at from 50 to 90°C and a pressure of from 10 to 30 bar, a molar ratio of hydrogen to butadiene of from 1.0 to 10 and an LHSV of from 5 to 20 m3 of fresh feed per m3 of catalyst per hour and a ratio of recycle to feed stream of from 0 to 15.<br>
The hydrogenation is carried out under "low ISOM" conditions under which very little, if any, C=C isomerization of 1-butene to 2-butene occurs. The residual<br><br>
butadiene content can be from 0 to 50 ppm, defending on the severity of the hydrogenation conditions.<br>
The reaction product obtained in this way is referred to as raffinate I and comprises, apart from isobutene, 1-butene and 2-butene in a molar ratio of from 2:1 to l:10,preferablyfrom2:l to 1:2.<br>
Alternative: removal of butadiene from crude C4 fraction by extraction<br>
The extraction of butadiene from crude C4 fraction is carried out according to BASF technology using N-methylpyrrolidone.<br>
The reaction product from the extraction is, in one embodiment of the invention, fed to the second step of the above-described selective hydrogenation in order to remove residual amounts of butadiene, with care having to be taken to ensure that little if any isomerization of 1-butene to 2-butene occurs.<br>
Removal of isobutene via etherification with alcohols<br>
In the etherification step, isobutene is reacted with alcohols, preferably with isobutanol, over an acid catalyst, preferably over an acid ion exchanger, to form ethers, preferably isobutyl tert-butyl ether. In one embodiment of the invention, the reaction is carried out in a three-stage reactor cascade in which the reaction mixture flows from the top downward through flooded fixed-bed catalysts. In the first reactor, the inlet temperature is from 0 to 60°C, preferably from 10 to 50°C; the outlet temperature is from 25 to 85°C, preferably from 35 to 75°C, and the pressure is from 2 to 50 bar, preferably from 3 to 20 bar. At a ratio of isobutanol to isobutene of from 0.8 to 2.0, preferably from 1.0 to 1.5, the conversion is from 70 to 90%.<br>
In the second reactor, the inlet temperature is from 0 to 60°C, preferably from 10 to 50°C; the outlet temperature is from 25 to 85°C, preferably from 35 to 75°C, and the pressure is from 2 to 50 bar, preferably from 3 to 20 bar. The total conversion over the two stages is increased to from 85 to 99%, preferably from 90 to 97%.<br>
In the third and largest reactor, equilibrium conversion is achieved at equal inlet and outlet temperatures of from 0 to 60°C, preferably from 10 to 50°C. The<br><br>
etherification and separation of the ether formed is followed by ether cleavage: the endothermic reaction is carried out over acid catalysts, preferably over acidic heterogeneous catalysts, for example phosphoric acid on an SiC&gt;2 support, at an inlet temperature of from 150 to 300°C, preferably from 200 to 250°C, and an outlet temperature of from 100 to 250°C, preferably from 130 to 220°C.<br>
When using FCC C4 fraction, it has to be expected that about 1% by weight of propane, about 30-40% by weight of isobutene and about 3-10% of C$-hydrocarbons may be introduced, and these can adversely affect the subsequent process sequence. Accordingly, the possibility of removing these components by distillation is provided for in the work-up of the ether.<br>
The reaction product obtained in this way, referred to as raffinate II, has a residual isobutene content of from 0.1 to 3% by weight.<br>
If relatively large amounts of isobutene are present in the product, for example when using FCC C4 fractions or when isobutene is removed by acid-catalyzed polymerization to polyisobutene (partial conversion), the remaining raffinate stream can, according to one embodiment of the invention, be subjected to a distillation before further processing.<br>
Purification of the raffinate II stream over adsorbent materials<br>
The raffinate II stream obtained after the etherification/polymerization (or distillation) is purified over at least one guard bed comprising high surface area aluminum oxides, silica gels, aluminosilicates or molecular sieves. The guard bed serves to dry the C4 stream and to remove substances which can act as catalyst poisons in the subsequent metathesis step. Preferred adsorbent materials are Selexsorb CD and CDO and 3A and NaX molecular sieves (13X). Purification is carried out in drying towers at temperatures and pressures which are chosen so that all components are present in the liquid phase. If desired, the purification step is used for preheating the feed to the subsequent metathesis step.<br>
The remaining raffinate II stream is virtually free of water, oxygen-containing compounds, organic chlorides and sulfur compounds.<br><br>
When the etherification step is carried out using methanol to prepare MTBE, the formation of dimethyl ether as secondary component may make it necessary to combine a plurality of purification steps or to use them sequentially.<br>
To maximize the yield of 2-pentene and 3-hexene, the following variants of the process of the present invention, which are shown in simplified schematic form in Fig. 1, Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, are preferred. In the interests of clarity, the reactions are in each case described without significant amounts of isobutene in the C4 feed. In the figures:<br><br>
•    Metathesis with 2-stage distillation and partial C4 recycle Isolation of 2-pentene and 3-hexene (Fig. 1)<br>
The product stream from the metathesis reactor R, comprising C2-C6-olefins and butanes, is fractionated in the distillation Dl to give a fraction comprising ethene, propene and from 0 to 50% of unreacted butenes and butanes, which may, if desired, be fed to the work-up sequence of a cracker, and a high boiler fraction comprising residual C4 and the 2-pentene and 3-hexene formed. The latter fraction is distilled in a column D2 to give 2-pentene at the side offtake and 3-hexene. Both streams are obtained in a purity of &gt; 99%. The C4 fraction is taken off at the top and recirculated to the metathesis reactor R. Column D2 can also be designed as a separation plate column. The reactor R and the column Dl can be coupled to form a reactive distillation unit.<br><br>
To increase the yield of Cs/Ce-olefins, the top product from the distillation column Dl can, if required, be recirculated to the metathesis reactor R.<br>
•   Metathesis step with 2-stage distillation and partial C4- and Cs-recycle Maximization of the hexene yield (Fig. 2)<br>
The product stream from the metathesis reactor R, comprising C2-C6-olefins and butanes, is fractionated in the distillation Dl to give a fraction comprising ethene, propene and from 0 to 50% of unreacted butenes and butanes, which may be fed to the work-up sequence of a cracker, and a high boiler fraction comprising residual C4 and the 2-pentene and 3-hexene formed. The latter fraction is distilled in a column D2 to obtain 3-hexene which is isolated in a purity of &gt;99%. The C4 fraction together with pentene is taken off at the top and recirculated to the metathesis reactor R. The reactor R and the columns Dl and D2 can be coupled to form a reactive distillation unit.<br>
•    Metathesis step with 3-stage distillation/partial C4- and Cs-recycle to maximize the hexene yield (Fig. 3)<br>
The product stream from the metathesis reactor R, comprising C2-C6-olefins and butanes, is fractionated in the distillation Dl to give a low boiler fraction comprising ethene and propene, which can either be fed to the work-up sequence of a cracker or, preferably, is separated into the pure components ethene and propene in a further distillation column D3, and a high boiler fraction comprising C4-olefins and butanes and the 2-pentene and 3-hexene formed. The latter fraction is fractionated in a column D2, which may, if desired, be designed as a side offtake column or dividing wall column, to give a low boiler fraction comprising C4-olefins and butanes, all or part of which can be recirculated to the metathesis step, an intermediate boiler fraction preferably comprising 2-pentene, all or part of which can be recirculated to the metathesis step, and a high boiler fraction comprising the desired product 3-hexene (purity of &gt; 99%), which is discharged.<br>
As catalysts, preference is given to heterogeneous rhenium catalysts known from the literature, for example Re20? on Y-AI2O3 or on mixed supports such as Si02/Al203, B203/Si02/Al203 or Fe203/Al203 having different metal contents.<br><br>
Regardless of the support chosen, the rhenium oxide content is from 1 to 20%, preferably from 3 to 10%.<br>
The catalysts are used in freshly calcined form and require no further activation (e.g. by means of alkylating agents). Deactivated catalyst can be regenerated a number of times by burning off coke residues at above 400°C in a stream of air and cooling under an inert gas atmosphere.<br>
Less suitable, but nevertheless able to be used according to the present invention, are homogeneous catalysts which are sometimes more active but have a significantly shorter operating life:<br>

Ittel, Homogeneous, Catalysis, 2nd edition, 1992. John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, Chichester, Brisbane, Toronto, Singapore, p. 217 ff; R.H. Grubbs in Prog. Inorg. Chem., S.

Polym,  Sci.  1993, Vol.   18,  1141-1195, and also homogeneous metathesis catalysts which are stable to protic media and to atmospheric oxygen, for example the defined ruthenium-alkylidene compounds of the formula RuX2(=CHR)(PR,3)2 (R=R-alkyl,aryl) described by R.H. Grubbs et al. in WO 93/20111, WO 96/04289, WO 96/06185, WO 97/03096 and WO 98/21214 and also mixtures generated in situ from [Ru(n -aryl)X2]2, phosphines PR3 and diazo compounds RCHN2, whose suitability as metathesis catalysts has been reported by A.F. Noels in J. Chem. Soc, Chem. Commun. 1995, 1127-1128. In comparison, heterogeneous catalysts, in particular molybdenum oxides, tungsten oxides and rhenium oxides on inorganic oxidic supports, which may have been pretreated with alkylating agents, are frequently found to be more sensitive to impurities in the feed. Their advantage over homogeneous catalysts having higher activity is the very simple catalyst regeneration which is usually carried out by burning off coke residues in a stream of air. Comparison of the heterogeneous catalysts with one another shows that Re207/Ab03 is active under very mild reaction conditions (T = 20-80°C) while M03/Si02 (M = Mo, W) become active only at temperatures above 100-150°C and it is therefore possible for C=C double bond isomerizations to occur as secondary reactions.<br><br>

To improve the cycle time of the catalysts used, especially the supported catalysts, purification of the feed using adsorber beds (guard beds) is advisable. The guard bed serves to dry the C4 stream and to remove substances which could act as catalyst poisons in the subsequent metathesis step. The preferred adsorbent materials are Selexsorb CD and CDO and also 3A and NaX molecular sieves (13X). The purification is carried out in drying towers at temperatures and pressures which are preferably chosen so that all components are in the liquid phase. The purification step may also be used for preheating the feed to the subsequent metathesis step. It can be advantageous to combine a plurality of purification steps with one another or to use them sequentially.<br>
The pressure and temperature in the metathesis step are chosen so that all reactants are present in the liquid phase (usually from 0 to 150°C, preferably from 20 to 80°C; p = 2-200 bar). However, as an alternative, it may be advantageous, particularly in the case of feed streams having a relatively high isobutene content, to carry out the reaction in the gas phase and/or to use a catalyst which has a relatively low acidity.<br>
In general, the reaction is complete after from 1 s to 1 h, preferably after from 30 s to 30 min. It can be carried out continuously or batchwise in reactors such as pressure gas vessels, flow tubes or reactive distillation apparatuses, with preference being given to flow tubes.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
Continuous experiment of the two-stage selective hydrogenation of crude C4<br>
fraction<br>
Crude C4 fraction having a composition of 43.7% of butadiene (including butenyne and butyne), 14.3% of 1-butene, 7.8% of 2-butenes and 7.2% of n-butane is reacted with 175 standard 1/h of hydrogen over 0.3% Pd/AI2O3 heterogeneous catalyst in a continuous flow tube reactor at a fresh feed flow of 1 kg/h of crude C4 fraction and a circulation of 8.2 kg/h at an LHSV of 9.0 h-1 at a reactor inlet temperature of 20°C. At a butadiene conversion of 95.2%, the first stage of the selective<br><br>
hydrogenation under these conditions achieves a total butene selectivity of 99.6% and a 1-butene selectivity of 56.5%.<br>
A typical reaction product from the first stage of the selective hydrogenation, comprising 0.61% of butadiene (including butenyne and butyne), 26.9% of 1-butene, 14.9% of 2-butenes and 11.6% of n-butane, is reacted with 16 standard 1/h of hydrogen over 0.3% PCI/AI2O3 heterogeneous catalyst (H0-13L) in a continuous flow tube reactor at a fresh feed flow of 2.2 kg/h of reaction product from the first stage and a circulation of 4.0 kg/h at an LHSV of 20 h'1 at a reactor inlet temperature of 60°C and a reactor outlet temperature of 70°C. At a butadiene conversion of 99.2% and a 1-butene yield of 58.2%, a raffinate I stream having a residual butadiene content of 48 ppm was obtained under these conditions.<br>
Example 2<br>
Continuous experiment on the removal of isobutene by etheriflcation with<br>
isobutanol<br>
In a three-stage reactor cascade, raffinate I and isobutanol are passed from the top downward through a flooded fixed bed of acid ion exchanger, with the ratio of isobutanol to isobutene in the feed being set to 1.2. The reactor inlet temperature is 40°C, the reactor outlet temperature is 65°C and the reaction pressure is 8 bar. The isobutene conversion after the first stage is measured as 85%. In the second, similarly dimensioned reactor, the conversion is increased to 95% at a reactor inlet temperature of 40°C, a reactor outlet temperature of 50°C and a reaction pressure of 8 bar. In the third, significantly larger reactor, equilibrium conversion is achieved at a reactor inlet temperature and reactor outlet temperature of 40°C in each case and a reaction pressure of 8 bar. The raffinate stream remaining under these conditions after removal of isobutyl tert-butyl ether by distillation has a residual isobutene content of 0.7%.<br>
Example 3<br>
Continuous experiment on the single-stage metathesis of raffinate II<br>
After feed purification over an adsorber bed of molecular sieve 13X, a C4 fraction comprising 43.5% of 1-butene, 36.2% of 2-butene, 2.0% of isobutene and 18.3% of butanes is passed continuously at a mass flow of 1300 g/h and a residence time<br><br>
of 3 minutes through a flow tube containing Re207/Al203 heterogeneous catalyst at 40°C and 10 bar (liquid phase). The reaction product is fractionated in a two-stage distillation sequence, with a C2/C3/C4 low boiler phase comprising 1.2% of ethene, 38.7% of propene, 31.3% of butenes, 2.9% of isobutene and 25.9% of butanes being taken off at the top of the first column at 10 bar. The bottoms comprising 28.0% of butenes, 1.3% of isobutene, 20.4% of butanes, 27.8% of 2-pentene and 21.9% of 3-hexene are subsequently passed to a second column operated at 2 bar, in which the C4/C5 low boiler fraction is taken off at the top and is all recirculated to the metathesis reaction. The high boiler fraction obtained at the bottom comprises 99.5% of 3-hexene. The percentages are in each case by mass. The butene conversions determined are 91% in respective of 1-butene and 50% in respect of 2-butene. The space-time yields determined were, on average, 700 g/1 x h of propene and 760 g/1 x h of 3-hexene.<br><br><br><br>
