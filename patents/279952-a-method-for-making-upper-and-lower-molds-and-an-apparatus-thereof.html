				<td>[Technical field]<br>
The present invention relates to a method for making upper and lower molds<br>
arid an apparatus therefor.<br>
[Background of the Invention]<br>
Some methods for making upper and lower molds are publicly known. One of<br>
them comprises the steps of holding a match-plate between cope and drag flasks,<br>
inserting upper and lower squeezing means into the respective openings of the cope and<br>
dragilasks, which openings are opposite to the match-plate, thereby defining upper and<br>
lower jaaolding spaces, then supplying molding sand to the upper and lower molding<br>
spaces, and causing the upper and lower squeezing means to move forward to the<br>
mateh*£lsfte 1br squeezing the molding sand in the upper and lower molding spaces so as<br>
to make flaskless upper and lower molds ;(see International Publication No.<br>
WO2005/05825A1).<br>
[Disclosure of the Invention]<br>
However, the conventional method for making upper and lower molds that<br>
comprises the above steps may cause differences between the pressures that are applied<br>
to the upper and lower squeezing means when the squeezing means are caused to move<br>
forward to the match-plate, because of the differences of the forward speeds or<br>
pressures of upper and lower squeezing means, because of the difference of patterns of<br>
both sides of a match-plate, because of the difference of the thicknesses of the upper'and<br>
lower molds, because of the difference of the densities of molding sand being filled in<br>
upper and lower molding spaces, etc. Therefore, the upper and lower squeezing<br>
pressures given by the driving means, which pressures cause the upper and lower<br>
squeezing means to mo ye forward, may become different, and-if so, one of the pressures<br>
will become very strong. Accordingly, the method- has problems such that the resulting<br>
mold may-be warped, or, at worst, the match-plate may be broken.<br>
This invention' was created to resolve these drawbacks. Its'purpose is' to.<br>
provide a method for making upper and lower molds and an apparatus therefor that can<br>
prevent the resulting mold from being warped and the match-plate from being broken.<br>
1<br>
 <br>
To this end, the method for making the upper and lower molds of claim 1<br>
comprises'the steps of holding a match-plate between cope and drag flasks, inserting<br>
upper and lower squeezing means into the respective openings of the cope and drag<br>
flasks, which openings are opposite to the match-plate, thereby'defining upper and<br>
lower molding spaces, then supplying molding sand to the upper and lower molding<br>
spaces, and causing the upper and lower squeezing means to move forward to the<br>
match-plate for squeezing the molding sand in the upper and lower molding spaces,<br>
wherein during the step of causing the upper and lower squeezing means to move<br>
forward to the match-plate, the difference between the squeezing pressures of the upper<br>
and lower molding spaces is kept within a predetermined tolerance.<br>
Also, the apparatus for making the upper and lower molds of claim 2 is one for<br>
holding a match-plate between cope and drag flasks, inserting upper and lower<br>
squeezing means into the respective openings of the cope and drag flasks, which<br>
openings are opposite to the match-plate, thereby-defining upper and lower molding<br>
spaces, then supplying molding sand to the upper and lower molding spaces, and<br>
causing the upper and lower squeezing means to move forward to the match-plate for<br>
squeezing the molding sand in the upper and lower molding spaces. The apparatus<br>
comprises upper and lower driving means that cause the respective upper and lower<br>
squeezing means to move forward to, and backward from, the match-plate, upper and<br>
lower squeezing pressure-measuring means that are installed on the upper and lower<br>
driving means and that measure the respective pressures when the sand is squeezed,<br>
and a command-transmitting means that determines the difference between the values<br>
measured by the upper and lower squeezing pressure-measuring means and compares<br>
it to a- predetermined tolerance. If the difference is larger than the tolerance, the<br>
command-transmitting means will send a command to the driving means so as to stop<br>
causing the driving means that has the larger pressure to move forward, until the<br>
difference falls within the predetermined tolerance.<br>
The inventions that comprise the above components cause the upper and lower<br>
Squeezing means to move forward to a match-plate by upper and lower driving means,<br>
to t&amp;ereby squeeze the molding sand in the upper and lower molding spaces. During<br>
S ¥riod, the" difference between-the upper and lower squeezing pressures is<br>
SStetmlned based on the result of a measurement by their t*gp"eT and'lower measuring<br>
means and is compared with a predetermined tolerance. If the difference is larger<br>
2<br>
 <br>
than the predetermined tolerance, a command-transmitting means will send a<br>
command to the driving means so as to stop causing the driving means that has the<br>
larger pressure to move forward until the difference falls within the predetermined<br>
tolerance.<br>
In this invention, each of the upper and lower driving means is a hydraulic<br>
cylinder with a hydraulic power unit or an electric cylinder with a power supply unit.<br>
If the driving means are hydraulic cylinders, then each of the upper and lower<br>
squeezing pressure-measuring means is a pressure sensor installed on the hydraulic<br>
power unit that measures the oil pressure, or a load cell that measures the force of the<br>
hydraulic cylinder. If they are electric cylinders with a power supply unit, then each of<br>
the measuring means is a voltmeter installed on the power supply unit that measures<br>
its voltage, or a load cell that measures the force of the electric cylinder. An ammeter<br>
may be used instead of the voltmeter.<br>
The apparatus for making upper and lower molds is one that makes tight-flask<br>
upper and lower molds, or one that make flaskless upper and lower molds.<br>
As is clear from the above explanation, the method of claim 1 comprises the<br>
steps of holding a match-plate between cope and drag flasks, inserting upper and lower<br>
squeezing means into the respective openings of the cope and drag flasks, which<br>
openings are opposite to the match-plate, thereby defining upper and lower molding<br>
spaces, then supplying molding sand to the upper and lower molding spaces, and<br>
causing the upper and lower squeezing means to move forward to the match-plate for<br>
squeezing the molding sand in the upper and lower molding spaces, wherein during the<br>
step of causing the upper and lower squeezing means to move forward to the<br>
match-plate the difference between the squeezing pressures of the upper and lower<br>
molding spaces is kept within a predetermined tolerance. Therefore, since the upper<br>
and lower squeezing means can be moved forward to the match-plate under the<br>
conditions that the upper and lower squeezing pressures are balanced, i.e., their<br>
difference i&gt;eing kept within a predetermined tolerance, the resulting mold can be<br>
prevented from being warped, or the match-plate can be prevented from being broken.<br>
fBrief Descriptions of the Drawings]<br>
Fig.l is a schematic diagram of an apparatus for making the upper and lower<br>
3<br>
 <br>
molds of the present invention.<br>
[Description of a Preferred Embodiment]<br>
Now, we discuss one embodiment of an apparatus for making upper and lower<br>
molds, referring to Fig. 1. As in Fig. 1, the apparatus comprises a match-plate 1, cope<br>
and drag flasks 2 and 3, upper and lower squeezing means 4 and 5, hydraulic cylinders<br>
7 and -8 with a hydraulic power unit 6, upper and lower pressure sensors 9 and 10, and a<br>
command-transmitting means 11. The hydraulic cylinders 7 and 8 have functions as<br>
upper and lower driving means that cause the respective upper and lower squeezing<br>
means 4 and 5 to move forward to, and backward from, the match-plate 1. The upper<br>
and lower pressure sensors 9 and 10 are installed on the hydraulic power unit 6 and<br>
have functions as upper and lower squeezing pressure-measuring means that measure<br>
the respective pressures when the sand is squeezed. The command-transmitting<br>
means 11 determines the difference between the values measured by the upper and<br>
lower pressure sensors 9 and 10 and compares it to a predetermined tolerance. If the<br>
difference is larger than a predetermined tolerance, the means 11 will send a command<br>
to the hydraulic power unit 6 so as to stop causing whichever of the hydraulic cylinder 7<br>
or 8 that has the larger pressure to move forward until the difference falls within the<br>
predetermined tolerance.<br>
Also, the hydraulic power unit 6 has two change-over valves 13 and 14. Each<br>
valve switches an oil supply to the respective port of the hydraulic cylinders 7 and 8,<br>
which oil is supplied from an oil pump 12.<br>
The apparatus that comprises the above components holds the match-plate 1<br>
between the cope and drag flasks 2 and 3. Then, the apparatus inserts the upper and<br>
lower squeezing means 4 and 5 into the respective openings of the cope and drag flasks<br>
2 mad 3, which openings are opposite to the match-plate 1, so as to define upper and<br>
lower molding spaces. Next, it supplies molding sand to the upper and lower molding<br>
spaces. Then, it causes the upper and lower squeezing means 4 and 5 to move forward<br>
to the match-plate 1 so as to squeeze the molding sand and make upper and lower<br>
Eftolcts.<br>
While the molding sand in the upper and lower molding spaces is being<br>
squeezed, the upper and lower pressure sensors 9 and 10 measure the pressures of the<br>
4<br>
 <br>
hydraulic cylinders 7 and 8, and send the measured values to the<br>
command-transmitting means 11. Then the command-transmitting means 11<br>
determines the difference between the pressures of the hydraulic cylinders 7 and 8. If<br>
the difference is larger than the predetermined tolerance, the means 11 will send a<br>
command to the change-over valve 13 or 14 of the hydraulic power unit 6 and change<br>
the valve position so as to stop causing whichever of the cylinder 7 or 8 that has the<br>
larger pressure to move forward until the difference falls within the tolerance. After<br>
that while the molding sand in the upper or lower molding space is being squeezed, the<br>
pressure of the oil in the hydraulic cylinder 7 or 8 that has the smaller pressure is<br>
increased. When the difference of their pressures in the cylinders 7 and 8 becomes<br>
within the predetermined tolerance, the position of the change-over valve 13 or 14 will<br>
be changed, and whichever of the cylinder 7 or 8 that has the larger pressure will be<br>
restarted, to be moved forward. By repeating these operations and maintaining the<br>
difference between the upper and lower squeezing pressures within the predetermined<br>
tolerance, the molding sand in the upper and lower molding spaces is squeezed, and<br>
thus the squeezing will be completed.<br>
