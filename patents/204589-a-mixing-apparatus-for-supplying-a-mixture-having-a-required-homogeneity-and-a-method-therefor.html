Figure 12 illustrates schematically a mixing apparatus in accordance with a fourth embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Figures 1 and 2 illustrate a mixing apparatus or a component thereof in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The mixing apparatus comprises a mixing device 1 for mixing materials, in this embodiment a batch mixer having a non-rotating mixing vessel, in particular a convective mixer such as an orbiting screw mixer, a first supply vessel 3 for containing a first material to be mixed by the mixing device 1 and a second supply vessel 5 for containing.a second material to be mixed by the mixing device 1. The mixing device 1 includes a mixing vessel 7 and has first and second inlet ports 8, 9 and an outlet port 11. The first inlet port 8 of the mixing device 1 is connected to the first supply vessel 3 by a first feed line 12 which includes a first feed mechanism 13, typically a pneumatic or mechanical device, for<br><br>
metering a predeterminable amount of the first material to the mixing device 1. The second inlet port 9 of the mixing device 1 is connected to the second supply vessel 5 by a second feed line 14 which includes a second feed mechanism 15, typically a pneumatic or mechanical device, for feeding a predeterminable amount of the second material to the mixing device 1.<br>
The mixing apparatus further comprises a supply line 19 connected to the outlet port 1 1 of the mixing device 1 for supplying mixed material to processing equipment, such as a tabletting machine. In this embodiment sections of the supply line 19 are horizontally directed and mixed material exiting the outlet port 11 of the mixing device 1 cannot pass through the supply line 19 by gravitational flow. The supply line 19 includes a feed mechanism 2 1, typically a pneumatic or mechanical device, for feeding material therethrough. The supply line 19 further includes along the length thereof a plurality of measuring devices, in this embodiment first, second and third measuring devices 23, 25, 27, for measuring the composition of the mixed material at a plurality of points in the supply line 19 as the mixed material passes therethrough. In this embodiment the first measuring device 23 is located at the inlet end of the supply line 19 and the third measuring device 27.is located at the outlet end of the supply line 19, thereby ensuring that the mixed material is measured immediately on passing into the supply line 19 and immediately prior to being fed to processing equipment. The supply line 19 further includes a plurality of three-way valves, in this embodiment first, second and third valves 29, 31, 33, each disposed immediately downstream of a respective one of the first, second and third measuring devices 23, 25, 27. The first, second and third valves 29, 31, 33 each include an inlet port 29a, 31a, 33a, a first outlet port 29b; 31b, 33b and a second outlet port 29c, 31c, 33c, with the inlet ports 29a, 31a, 33a and the first outlet ports 29b, 31b, 33b being in the supply line 19 and the second outlet ports 29c, 31c, 33c being connected to a waste line 35 for transferring mixed material not having the required homogeneity to a waste vessel. The waste line 35 includes a feed mechanism 36 for feeding the non-homogenous mixed material to the waste vessel. In this embodiment the sections of the waste line 35 upstream<br><br>
of the feed mechanism 36 have a downwardly-directed component such that the non-homogeneous mixed material flows by gravitational flow to the feed mechanism 36.<br>
The mixing apparatus further comprises a controller 37, typically a computer or a programmable logic controller (PLC), for controlling the operation of each of the mixing device 1, the first feed mechanism 13 connected to the first supply vessel 3. the second feed mechanism 15 connected to the second supply vessel 5, the feed mechanism 21 in the supply line 19, the first, second and third measuring devices 23, 25, 27 in the supply line 19, the first, second and third valves 29, 31,33 in the supply line 19 and the feed mechanism 36 in the waste line 35.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 2, each of the first, second and third measuring devices 23, 25, 27 is a reflectance measuring device of the same construction and comprises a measurement probe 39, in this embodiment a reflectance probe, which extends through the peripheral wall 19a of the supply line 19 such that the distal end 41 of the measurement probe 39, through which radiation is emitted and received, is directed into the supply line 19. In this way, reflectance measurements can be taken from the mixed material passing through the supply line 19. Each of the measuring devices 23, 25, 27 further comprises a radiation generating unit 43 for generating electromagnetic radiation and a detector-unit 45 for detecting the radiation diffusely reflected by the mixed material in the supply line i9. In this embodiment the radiation generating unit 43 comprises in the following order a radiation source 47, a focusing lens 49, a filter arrangement 51 and at least one fibre cable 53 for leading the focused and filtered radiation to the distal end 41 of the measurement probe 39. In this embodiment the radiation source 47 is a broad spectrum visible to infra-red source, such as a tungsten-halogen lamp, which emits radiation in the near infra-red interval of from 400 to 2500 nm and the filter arrangement 51 comprises a plurality of filters each allowing the passage of radiation of a respective single frequency or frequency band. In other embodiments the radiation source 47 could be any of a source of visible light, such as an arc lamp, a source of x-rays, a laser, such as a diode laser, or a light-emitting diode (LED) and the filter arrangement 51 could be replaced by a monochromator<br>
or a spectrometer of Fourier transform kind.  In this embodiment the detector unit 45 comprises in the following order an array of fibre cables 55, whose distal ends are arranged around the distal end of the at least one fibre cable 53 through which radiation is emitted, and a detector 57 connected to the fibre cables 55. The detector 57 is preferably one of an integrating detector, such as an Si, PbS or In-Ga-As integrating detector, a diode array detector, such as an Si or Ln-Ga-As diode array detector, or a one or two-dimensional array detector, such as a CMOS chip, a CCD chip or a focal plane array. The distal ends of the fibre cables 55 are preferably spaced from the distal end of the at least one fibre cable 53 in order to minimise the effect of specular reflection or stray energy reaching the fibre cables 55.  In use. the detector 57 will produce signals depending upon the composition of the mixed material and the frequency of the provided radiation. These signals are amplified, filtered and digitised and passed to the controller 37.<br>
Figures 3 to 5 illustrate modified measuring devices 23. 25, 27 for the above-described mixing apparatus. These modified measuring devices 23, 25, 27 are quite similar structurally and operate in the same manner as the measuring device 23, 25, 27 in the above-described mixing apparatus. Hence, in order not to duplicate description unnecessarily, only the structural differences of these modified measuring devices 23, 25, 27 will be described.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates a first modified measuring device 23, 25, 27 which operates as a transflective measuring device. This measuring device 23, 25, 27 differs from the first-described measuring device 23, 25, 27 in that a reflective surface 59, typically a mirrored surface, is disposed in the supply line 19, in this embodiment on the inner side of the supply line 19, opposite the path of the radiation provided by the at least one fibre cable 53. In use, radiation provided by the at least one fibre cable 53 passes through the material in the supply line 19 and is reflected back to the fibre cables 55.by the reflective surface 59.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates a second modified measuring device 23, 25, 27 which operates as a transmissive measuring device. This measuring device 23, 25, 27 differs from the first-<br><br>
described measuring device 23, 25, 27 in that the distal ends of the fibre cables 55 are disposed at the side of the supply line 19, in this embodiment on the inner side of the supply line 19, opposite the path of the radiation provided by the at least one fibre cable 53. In use, radiation provided by the at least one fibre cable 53 passes through the material in the supply line 19 and is received by the opposing fibre cables 55.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates a third modified measuring device 23, 25, 27 which operates as a reflective measuring device. This measuring device 23, 25, 27 differs from the first-described measuring device 23. 25, 27 only in that the measurement probe 39 does not extend into the supply line 19. Instead, the peripheral wall 19a of the supply line 19 includes a window 61 which is transparent or at least translucent to the radiation employed by the measuring device 23, 25, 27. It will, of course, be appreciated that the measuring devices 23, 25, 27 described in relation, to Figures 3 and 4 could also be so modified.<br>
In use, the first and second feed mechanisms 13, 15 connected respectively to the first and second supply vessels 3, 5 are controlled by the controller 37 to meter in the required proportions amounts of the first and second materials to the mixing vessel 7 of the mixing device 1. Under the control of the controller 37 the mixing device 1 is then operated for a predetermined period of time, this period of time depending upon the materials being mixed. After such mixing, a mixture of the first and second materials having a required homogeneity should, have been achieved. However, this may not necessarily be the case as insufficient time may have been allowed for mixing or in some circumstances, whilst the bulk of the mixed material may have the required homogeneity, pockets may exist in the mixed material which do not have the required homogeneity. Under the control of the controller 37, with the first, second and third valves 29, 31, 33 in the supply line 19 set to provide communication between the respective inlet ports 29a, 31a, 33a and first outlet ports 29b, 31b, 33b thereof, the feed mechanism 21 in the supply line 19 is actuated to feed mixed material from the mixing vessel 7 of the mixing device I through the supply line 19. As the mixed material passes through the supply line 19 the mixed material is first measured by the first measuring device 23. If the mixed material passing the first<br><br>
measuring device 23 is measured as having the required homogeneity, then the mixed material is fed further through the supply line 19 by the feed mechanism 21 therein. If, however, the mixed material passing the first measuring device 23 is measured.as not having the required homogeneity, then, under the control of the controller 37, the first valve 29 in the supply line 19 is set to provide communication between the inlet port 29a and the second outlet port 29c thereof so as to divert the mixed material not having the required homogeneity into the waste line 35 and the feed mechanism 36 in the waste line 35 is actuated for a predetermined period of time, with the mixed material being continuously measured by the first measuring device 23. If, during this period of time, the mixed material passing the first measuring device 23 is measured as having the required homogeneity, then, under the control of the controller 37. the feed mechanism 36 in the waste line 35 is stopped and the first valve 29 in the supply line 19 is set to provide communication between the inlet port 29a and the first outlet port 29b thereof so as to restore the flow path through the supply line 19. If, however, after this period of time, the mixed material passing the first measuring device 23 is still measured as not having the required homogeneity, then, under the control of the controller 37, the feed mechanism 21 in the supply line 19 is stopped, the feed mechanism 36 in the waste line 35 is stopped, the first valve 29 in the supply line 19 is set to provide communication between the inlet port 29a and the first outlet port 29b thereof and the mixing device 1 is operated for a further  redetermined period of time. After such further mixing, the above-described steps are   repeated. When the mixed material passing the first measuring device 23 is measured as  having the required homogeneity, then the mixed material is fed further through the supply line 19 by the feed mechanism 21 therein. As the mixed material is fed further through the supply line 19 the mixed material is measured by the second measuring device 25 downstream of the first measuring device 23. If the mixed material passing the first and second measuring devices 23, 25 is measured as having the required homogeneity, then the  mixed material is fed further through the supply line 19 by the feed mechanism 21 therein. If, however, the mixed material passing the second measuring device 25 is measured as no longer having the required homogeneity, as may occasionally happen because, for example,<br>
of segregation during flow, then, under the control of the controller 37. the second valve 31<br><br><br>
in the supply line 19 is set to provide communication between the inlet port 3 la and the second outlet port 31c thereof so. as to divert the mixed material not having the required homogeneity into the waste line 35 and the feed mechanism 36 in the waste line 35 is actuated, with the mixed material being continuously measured by the second measuring device 25. When the mixed material passing the second measuring device 25 is measured again as having the required homogeneity, then, under the control of the controller 37; the feed mechanism 36 in the waste line 35 is stopped and the second valve 31 in the supply line 19 is set to provide communication between the inlet port 3 la and the first outlet port 31b thereof so as to restore the flow path through the supply line 19. When the mixed material passing the first and second measuring devices 23, 25 is measured as having the required homogeneity, then the mi-xed material is fed further through the supply line 19 by the feed mechanism 21 therein. As the mixed material is fed further through the supply line 19 the mixed material is measured by the third measuring device 27 downstream of the second measuring device 25. If the mixed material passing the first, second and third measuring devices 23, 25, 27 is measured as having the required homogeneity, then the mixed material is fed further through the supply line 19 by the feed mechanism 21 therein<br>
 to processing equipment. If, however, the mixed material passing the third measuring<br><br>
device 27 is measured as no longer having the required homogeneity, then, under the control.of the controller 37, the third valve 33 in the supply line 19 is set to provide communication between the inlet port 33a and the second outled  port 33c thereof so as to divert the mixed material not having the required homogeneity into the waste line 35 and the feed mechanism 36 in the waste line 35 is actuated, with the mixed material being continuously measured by the third measuring device 27. When the mixed material passing the third measuring device 27 is measured again as having the required homogeneity then, under the control of the controller 37, the feed mechanism 36 in the waste line 35 is stopped and the third valve 33 in the supply line 19 is set to provide communication between the inlet port 33a and the first outlet port 33b thereof so as to restore the flow path through the supply line 19. When the mixed material passing the first, second and third measuring devices 23, 25, 27 is measured as having the required<br><br>
homogeneity, then the mixed material is fed further through the supply line 19 by the feed mechanism 21 therein to processing equipment.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates a mixing apparatus in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention.<br>

Figures 9 to 11 respectively illustrate alternative measuring devices 118, 123, 125, 127 for the above-described mixing apparatus. These measuring devices 118, 123, 125, 127 are quite similar structurally and operate in the same manner as the measuring device 118, 123, 125,127 in the above-described mixing apparatus. Hence, in order not to duplicate Lription unnecessarily, only the structural differences of these modified measuring devices 118, 123, 125,127 will be described.<br><br><br>
Figure 9 illustrates a first modified measuring device 118, 123, 125, 127 which operates as a transflective measuring device. This measuring device 118. 123, 125, 127 differs from the first-described measuring device 118, 123, 125, 127 in that a reflective surface 159, typically a mirrored surface, is disposed in the respective line 116, 119, in this embodiment on the inner side of the respective line 116, 119, opposite the path of the radiation emitted from the at least one fibre cable 153. In use, radiation provided by the at least one fibre cable 153 passes through the material in the respective line 116, 119 and is reflected back to the fibre cables 155 by the reflective surface 159.<br>
Figure 10 illustrates a second modified measuring device 118, 123, 125. 127 which operates as a transmissive measuring device. This measuring device 118, 123, 125, 127 differs from the first-described measuring device 118, 123, 125, 127 in that the distal ends of the fibre cables 155 are disposed at the side of the respective line 116, 119, in this embodiment on the inner side of the respective line 116, 119, opposite the path of the radiation emitted from the at least one fibre cable 153. In use, radiation provided by the at least one fibre cable 153 passes through the material in the respective line 116, 119 and is received by the fibre cables 155.<br>
Figure 11 illustrates a third modified measuring device 118, 123, 125, 127 which operates as a reflectance measuring device. This measuring device 118, 123, 125, 127 differs from the first-described measuring device 118, 123, 125, 127 only in that the measurement probe 139 does not extend into the respective line 116, 119. Instead, the peripheral wall 116a, 119a of the respective line 116, 119 is provided with a window 161 which is transparent or at least translucent to the radiation employed by the measuring device 118, 123, 125, 127. It will, of course, be appreciated that the measuring devices 118, 123, 125, 127 described in relation to Figures 9 and 10 could also be so modified.<br>
In use. the first, second and third feed mechanisms 113, 115, 117 connected respectively to the first, second and third supply vessels 103, 105, 106 are controlled by the controller 137 to meter selectively amounts of the first material, the second material and the, non-<br><br>
homogeneous mixture of the first and second materials per unit time so as to feed the equired proportions of the first and second materials to the mixing vessel 107 of the mixing device 101 which is operated for continuous mixing. The non-homogeneous mixture of the first and second materials contained in the third supply vessel 106 is :ollected during previous mixing of the first and second materials. By providing a neasuring device 118 in the third feed line 116 connected to the third feed vessel 106, the :omposition of the non-homogeneous mixture of the first and second materials which is ed from the third supply vessel 106 can be measured on-line and the first, second and third eed mechanisms 113, 115, 117 connected to the first, second and third supply vessels 103, 05, 106 are operated so as selectively to feed to the mixing device 101 relative amounts of he first material, the second material and the non-homogeneous mixture of the first and econd materials and thereby provide the required proportions of the first and second naterials for mixing. In this way, no first and second material is wasted. As the materials are mixed, under the control of the controller 137, with the first, second and third valves 29, 131, 133 in the supply line 119 set to provide communication between the respective nlet ports 129a, 131a, 133a and first outlet ports 129b, 131b, 133b thereof, the feed nechanism 121 in the supply line 119 is actuated to feed mixed material from the mixing vessel 107 of the mixing device 101 through the supply line 119. As the mixed material lasses through the supply line 119 the mixed material is first measured by the first neasuring device 123 in the supply-line 119. If the mixed material passing the first neasuring device 123 in the supply line 119 is measured as having the required lomogeneity, then the mixed material is fed further through the supply line 119 by the feed nechanism 121 therein. If, however, the mixed material passing the first measuring device 23 in the supply line 119 is measured as not having the required homogeneity, then, under he control of the controller 137, the first valve 129 in the supply line 121 is set to provide :ommunicatioh between the inlet port 129a and the second outlet port 129c thereof so as to liven the mixed material not having the required homogeneity into the return line 135 and he feed mechanism 136 in the return line 135 is actuated to transfer the mixed material not laving the required homogeneity to the third supply vessel 106, with the mixed material being continuously measured by the first measuring device 123 in the supply line 119.<br><br>
When the mixed material passing the first measuring device 123 in the supply line 119 is measured as having the required homogeneity, then  under the control of the controller 137, the feed mechanism 136 in the return line 135 is stopped and the first valve 129 in the supply line 119 is set to provide communication between the inlet port 129a and the first outlet port 129b thereof so as to restore the flow path in the supply line 119. When the mixed material passing the first measuring device 123 in the supply line 119 is measured as having the required homogeneity, then the mixed material is fed further through the supply-line 119 by the feed mechanism 121 therein. As the mixed material is fed further through the supply line 119 the mixed material is measured by the second measuring device 125 downstream of the first measuring device 123 in the supply line 119. If the mixed material passing the first and second measuring devices 123, 125 in the supply line 119 is measured as having the required homogeneity, then the mixed material is fed further through the supply line 119 by the feed mechanism 121 therein. If, however, the mixed materia] passing the second measuring device 125 in the supply line 119 is measured as no longer having the required homogeneity, as may occasionally happen because, for example, of segregation during flow, then, under the control of the controller 137, the second valve 131 in the supply line 121 is set to provide communication between the inlet port 13 la and the second outlet port 13 lc thereof so as to divert the mixed material not having the required homogeneity into the return line 135 and the feed mechanism 136 in the return line 135 is actuated to transfer the mixed material not having the required homogeneity to the third supply vessel 106, with the mixed material being continuously measured by the second measuring device 125 in the supply line 119. When the mixed material passing the second measuring device 125 in the supply line 119 is measured again as having the required homogeneity, then, under the control of the controller 137, the feed mechanism 136 in the delivery line 135 is stopped and the second valve 131 in the supply line 119 is set to provide communication between the inlet port 131 a and the first outlet port 131b thereof so as to restore the flow path through the supply line 119. When the mixed material passing the first and second measuring devices 123, 125 in the supply line 119 is measured as having the required homogeneity, then the mixed material is fed further through the supply line 119 by the feed mechanism 121 therein. As the mixed material is fed further through<br><br>
the supply line 119 the mixed material is measured by the third measuring device 127 downstream of the second measuring device 125 in the supply line 119.  If the mixed material passing the third measuring device 127 in the supply line 119 is measured as having the required homogeneity, then the mixed material is fed further through the supply line 1 19 by the feed mechanism 121 therein to processing equipment. If, however, the mixed material passing the third measuring device 127 in the supply line 119 is measured as no longer having the required homogeneity, then, under the control of the controller 137, the third valve 133 in the supply line 121 is set to provide communication between the inlet port 133a and the second outlet port 133c thereof so as to divert the mixed material not having the required homogeneity into the return line 135 and the feed mechanism 136 in the return line 135 is actuated to transfer the mixed material not having the required homogeneity to the third supply vessel 106, with the mixed material being continuously measured by the third measuring device 127 in the supply line 119. When the mixed material passing the third measuring device 127 in the supply line 119 is measured again as having the required homogeneity, then, under the control of the controller 137, the feed mechanism 136 in the return line 135 is stopped and the third valve 133 in the supply line 119 is set to provide communication between the inlet port 133a and the first outlet port 133b thereof so as to restore the flow path through the supply line 119. When the mixed material passing the first, second and third measuring devices 123, 125, 127 in the supply line 119 is measured as having the required homogeneity, then the mixed material is fed further through the supply line 119 by the feed mechanism 121 therein to processing equipment.<br>
