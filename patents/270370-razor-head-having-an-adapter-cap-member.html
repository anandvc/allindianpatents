Accordingly, no matter the number of blades, the step of riveting the blade assembly 3 to the platform guard 2 is achieved before the step of mounting the platform rear cap 4. In other words, the blade assembly 3 is fixed to the platform guard 2 separately and independently from the platform rear cap 4, so that, in case an accidental separation of the platform rear cap 4 from the platform guard 2 occurs, scattering of the blades is avoided.<br>
In addition, since the blade assembly 3 is fixed to the platform guard 2 independently from the platform rear cap 4, it is possible to strongly fix the latter to the platform guard 2, as described hereinafter.<br><br>
Furthermore, since the securing pins 16 hold the blade assembly 3 only, which is sandwiched by the securing plate, the securing pins are shorter than the ordinary ones, so that they are stronger and there is less risk that the blades be accidentally detached from the platform guard 2.<br>
As illustrated in figures 2 and 5, the platform rear cap 4 forms a cover which, when secured onto the platform guard 2, closes the internal volume 8 wherein the blade assembly 3 is unreachably lodged.<br>
Of course, the thickness of the platform guard 2, i.e. the height of the peripheral wall 7, shall be adapted to the thickness of the blade assembly 3, depending on the number of blades.<br>
As depicted on figure 5, after the blade assembly 3 has been riveted, the crimping heads 54 do not project outside from the internal volume 8 of the platform guard 2, so that when mounted onto the platform guard 2, the platform rear cap 4 is not prevented from abutting against the peripheral wall 7 of the platform guard 2.<br>
As further depicted on figure 5, the platform rear cap 4 is laser welded onto the platform guard 2. There is provided a laser source which is connected to a laser welding head 55 through a flexible laser beam guiding element 56. The laser welding head 55 is mounted onto an arm 57 which is, in turn, slidingly mounted on a clamping element 58 in a direction perpendicular to an interface 59 between the platform rear cap 4 and the platform guard 2, as shown by arrow Fl. Moreover, the laser welding head 55 is slideable, with respect of the clamping element 58, in both directions in a plan substantially parallel to the interface 59 between the platform rear cap 4 and the platform guard 2, so that the laser welding head 55 can move along a predetermined welding path 60 illustrated in<br><br>
figure 6,  which follows the contour of the peripheral wall 7.<br>
In a preferred embodiment illustrated in figure 5, platform guard 2 is mounted on the bottom side of the assembly, while the platform rear cap 4 is mounted on the top thereof. As a laser beam 61 comes from the top, the platform rear cap 4 and the platform guard 2 have to be made of suitable polymers in order to allow laser welding. In this particular case, platform rear cap 4 has to be transparent to the laser beam 61 while platform guard 2 has, on the contrary, to be absorbing. As the laser wave length is outside the visible range, both pieces 2, 4 may be dyed according to the wishes of the manufacturer, provided that they present sufficient transparency and opacity to the laser beam 61, respectively.<br>
Besides, the interface 59 formed by overlapping of the platform rear cap 4 and the platform guard 2 (i.e. by conjunction of rim 38 and top surface 39) must be of sufficient area to prevent the welding path or melting zone 60 from reaching the edges of the interface 59.<br>
The laser welding method is described in further details in US patent nr. 6,201,211, the whole content of which is herewith incorporated by reference.<br>
As described here above, this welding method is used to laser weld the platform rear cap 4 to the platform guard 2, since there is a need for strongly securing both pieces 2, 4 to each other in order to avoid separation during shaving, which could injury the user's face (or other body areas to be shaved) . There is also a need for preventing a child who would be playing with the razor from easily separating the platform rear cap 4 from the platform guard, thereby easily accessing the blades.<br>
Laser welding could also be used to weld other plastic parts of the razor, which need to be strongly secured together.<br><br>
For instance, in a razor having a handle comprising several plastic parts, the method of producing the razor according to the invention comprises a step of laser welding together at least two plastic parts of the handle.<br>
The technique of laser welding may be the same as previously recited. Therefore, one of the plastic part has to be transparent in order to allow transmission of the laser beam, while the other part has to be absorbing.<br>
The one part may be an upper member of the handle and the other a lower member, the upper and the lower members being laser welded together to form the whole handle.<br>
A decorative insert (e.g. for an advertising purpose) may be sandwiched between the upper and the lower members, the insert being visible through the transparent upper member.<br><br><br>
