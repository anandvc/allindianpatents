Field of the invention<br>
The invention relates to an apparatus and method for controlling cell selection<br>
in a cellular communication system and in particular a cellular communication<br>
system supporting a plurality of modulation schemes.<br>
Background of the Invention	<br>
In a cellular communication system a geographical region is divided into a<br>
number of cells each of which is served by base station. The base stations are<br>
interconnected by a fixed network which can communicate data between the<br>
base stations. A mobile station is served via a radio communication link by the<br>
base station of the cell within which the mobile station is situated.<br>
As a mobile station moves, it may move from the coverage of one base station<br>
to the coverage of another, i.e. from one cell to another. As the mobile station<br>
moves towards base station, it enters a region of overlapping coverage of two<br>
base stations and within this overlap region it changes to be supported by the<br>
new base station. As the mobile station moves further into the new cell, it<br>
continues to be supported by the new base station. This is known as a<br>
handover or handoff of a mobile station between cells.<br>
A cellular communication system extends coverage over typically an entire<br>
country and comprises hundreds or even thousands of cells supporting<br>
thousands or even millions of mobile stations. Communication from a mobile<br><br>
station to a base station is known as uplink, and communication from a base<br>
station to a mobile station is known as downlink.<br>
The fixed network interconnecting the base stations is operable to route data<br>
 between any two base stations, thereby enabling a mobile station in a cell to<br>
communicate with a mobile station in any other cell. In addition, the fixed<br>
network comprises gateway functions for interconnecting to external networks<br>
such as the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), thereby allowing<br>
mobile stations to communicate with landline telephones and other<br>
communication terminals connected by a landline. Furthermore, the fixed<br>
network comprises much of the functionality requited for managing a<br>
conventional cellular communication network including functionality for<br>
routing data, admission control, resource allocation, subscriber billing, mobile<br>
station authentication etc.<br>
Currently, the most ubiquitous cellular communication system is the 2nd<br>
generation communication system known as the Global System for Mobile<br>
communication (GSM). GSM uses a technology known as Time Division<br>
Multiple Access (TDMA) wherein user separation is achieved by dividing<br>
frequency carriers into 8 discrete time slots, which individually can be<br>
allocated to a user. A base station may be allocated a single carrier or a<br>
multiple of carriers. One carrier is used for a pilot signal which further<br>
contains broadcast information. This carrier is used by mobile stations for<br>
measuring of the signal level of transmissions from different base stations, and<br>
the obtained information is used for determining a suitable serving cell during<br>
initial access or handovers. GSM uses a constant amplitude phase modulation<br>
scheme known as Gaussian Minimum Shift Keying (GMSK). Further<br>
description of the GSM TDMA communication system can be found in 'The<br>
GSM System for Mobile Communications' by Michel Mouly and Marie<br>
 Bernadette Pautet, Bay Foreign Language Books, 1992, ISBN 2950719007.<br><br>
To further enhance the services and performance of the GSM communication<br>
system, a number of enhancements and additions have been introduced to the<br>
GSM communication system over the years.<br>
One such enhancement is the General Packet Radio System (GPRS), which is<br>
a system developed for enabling packet data based communication in a GSM<br>
communication system. Thus, the GPRS system is compatible with the GSM<br>
(voice) system and provides a number of additional services including<br>
provision of packet data communication, which augments and complements<br>
the circuit switched communication of a traditional communication system.<br>
Furthermore, the packet based data communication may also support packet<br>
based speech services. The GPRS system has been standardised as an add-on<br>
to an existing GSM communication system, and can be introduced to an<br>
existing GSM communication system by introducing new network elements.<br>
Specifically, a number of Serving GPRS Support Nodes (SGSN) and Gateway<br>
GPRS Support Nodes (GGSN) may be introduced to provide a packet based<br>
fixed network communication.<br>
Another enhancement is the Enhanced Data rate for GSM Evolution (EDGE)<br>
 system, which comprises an air interface transmission protocol using a<br>
number of techniques to provide higher throughput over the air interface.<br>
Specifically, EDGE utilises higher order modulation schemes (8-PSK<br>
modulation), channel adaptation, Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) schemes<br>
and incremental redundancy to provide a high data throughput. Furthermore,<br>
 EDGE is particularly suited for packet based communication over the air<br>
interface.<br>
In particular, a radio access network known as a GERAN (GSM/EDGE Radio<br>
Access Network) has been standardised. The GERAN allows for traditional<br>
 GSM services to be provided as well as the enhanced services and performance<br>
provided by EDGE and GPRS.<br><br>
Currently, 3rd generation systems are being rolled out to further enhance the<br>
communication services provided to mobile users. The most widely adopted 3rd<br>
generation communication systems are based on Code Division Multiple<br>
Access (CDMA) wherein user separation is obtained by allocating different<br>
spreading and scrambling codes to different users on the same carrier<br>
frequency, The transmissions are spread by multiplication with the allocated<br>
codes thereby causing the signal to be spread over a wide bandwidth. At the<br>
receiver, the codes are used to de-spread the received signal thereby<br>
regenerating the original signal. Each base station has a code dedicated for a<br>
pilot and broadcast signal, and as for GSM this is used for measurements of<br>
multiple cells in order to determine a serving cell. An example of a<br>
communication system using this principle is the Universal Mobile<br>
Telecommunication System (UMTS), which is currently being deployed.<br>
Further description of CDMA and specifically of the Wideband CDMA<br>
(WCDMA) mode of UMTS can be found in 'WCDMA for UMTS', Harri Holma<br>
(editor), Antti Toskala (Editor), Wiley &amp; Sons, 1091, ISBN 0471486876;<br>
In a UMTS CDMA communication system, the communication network<br>
comprises a core network and a UMTS Radio Access Network (UTRAN). The<br>
core network is operable to route data from one part of the RAN to another, as<br>
well as interfacing with other communication systems. In addition, it performs<br>
many of the operation and management functions of a cellular communication<br>
system, such as billing. The RAN is operable to support wireless user<br>
equipment over a radio link being part of the air interface. The RAN comprises<br>
the base stations, which in UMTS are known as Node Bs, as well as Radio<br>
Network Controllers (RNC) which control the Node Bs and the communication<br>
over the air interface.<br>
In order to increase the spectral efficiency, increase data rates, provide a<br>
variety of services and support a variety of equipment and standards, cellular<br><br>
communication systems increasingly support a number of different modulation<br>
schemes. Thus, in current and future wireless packet/circuit switched data and<br>
voice systems, one of the techniques used to offer variable rates is through<br>
varying the modulation scheme of the transmitted signal. In particular, an<br>
EDGE GSM communication system supports both GMSK modulation and 8-<br>
PSK modulation. Among other things, this allows EDGE capable mobile<br>
stations to utilise the additional features of EDGE while ensuring the legacy<br>
mobile stations may still be supported.<br>
One issue that is generally encountered when adopting such a technique is<br>
that the hardware capability of the transmitters of base stations and handsets,<br>
hi connection with the characteristics and requirements of the individual<br>
modulation schemes, results in the maximum transmit power of a base station<br>
being dependent on the selected modulation scheme.<br>
For example, GMSK is a constant amplitude modulation scheme and is<br>
accordingly not sensitive to non-linearities of the transmit path, such as non-<br>
linearities occurring in the power amplifier. Accordingly, the power amplifier<br>
may be operated in a non-linear region and without backing off. This allows for<br>
the power amplifier to be used at a maximum output power level.<br>
In contrast, 8-PSK is a non-constant amplitude linear modulation scheme<br>
which requires a substantially linear processing. Therefore, the power<br>
amplifier must be operated in a substantially linear region requiring a back off<br>
of typically around 4-5 dB. In order to reduce cost, the same power amplifier is<br>
used for both GMSK and 8-PSK and the maximum power transmitted for 8-<br>
PSK is consequently typically around 4-5 dB less than for GMSK. This may<br>
cause a significant variation in the transmitted power levels depending on the<br>
modulation schemes used.<br><br>
In cellular communication systems, power level measurements of uplink or<br>
downlink signals are frequently used for cell selection procedures. However, as<br>
the transmitted power levels may depend on the modulation schemes used, the<br>
cell selection procedures are not optimal. The transmit power variations<br>
 caused by the variations in modulation scheme may degrade the performance<br>
of the cell selection procedures and accordingly the load control and resource<br>
management may be less effective resulting in a reduced capacity of the<br>
communication system as a whole.<br>
 In particular, in an EDGE GSM communication system, cell selection is based<br>
on power level measurements of the BCCH carrier. The BCCH carrier is<br>
divided into eight time slots with one time slot reserved for broadcast of<br>
control information. The remaining seven time slots may be used for user<br>
traffic and may use GMSK or 8'PSK modulation schemes. The BCCH carrier<br>
 is always transmitted at a maximum power level to provide large cell coverage<br>
and a suitable power reference for signal level measurements. However, as the<br>
maximum power level differs for different modulation schemes, the cell<br>
selection may be affected by the choice of modulation schemes in each time<br>
slot. This may complicate and degrade resource and cell load management.<br><br>
For example, a BCCH of one cell supporting GMSK in seven time slots will<br>
have an average transmit power almost 4-5 dB higher than a BCCH of another<br>
cell supported by a base station having the same power amplifier<br>
characteristics but using 8-PSK in seven time slots. Thus, due to the difference<br>
 in modulation schemes the mobile stations will be biased from the cell<br>
supporting EDGE towards the cell supporting GMSK. This may for example<br>
cause the EDGE cell to be underloaded while the GMSK cell is overloaded<br>
thereby reducing the capacity of the cellular"communication system.<br>
 Hence, an improved system of cell selection would.be advantageous and in<br>
 particular a system allowing increased flexibility, improved cell selection<br><br>
control, improved insensitivity to dynamic variations, improved cell selection<br>
performance and/or increased capacity of a cellular communication system<br>
would be advantageous.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, the Invention seeks to preferably mitigate, alleviate or eliminate<br>
one or more of the above mentioned disadvantages singly or in any<br>
 combination.<br>
According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided an apparatus for<br>
controlling cell selection in a cellular communication system supporting a<br>
plurality of modulation schemes, the apparatus comprising: means for<br>
 determining a modulation scheme distribution for a plurality of<br>
communication channels of at least one cell; and means for modifying a cell<br>
selection criterion in response to the modulation scheme distribution.<br>
The invention may allow cell selection to take the modulation scheme<br>
 distribution in the cellular communication system into account. The<br>
modulation scheme distribution is an indication of the modulation scheme<br>
utilisation in the cellular communication and may in particular reflect the<br>
modulation schemes used in the at least one cell.<br>
 The cell selection criterion may be optimised or improved for the modulation<br>
scheme utilisation. This may result in improved cell selection performance<br>
and/or may allow more reliable and/ or accurate control of the cell selection<br>
procedures. The resource management may be improved and in particular the<br>
management and control of the loading of cells may be improved. This may<br>
 reduce the probability of overloaded cells and may increase the capacity of the<br>
cellular communication system and improve the user service. For example, the<br><br>
number of dropped calls or access denials in the communication system may be<br>
reduced.<br>
In particular, the invention may compensate or offset a bias in the cell<br>
selection performance due to the used modulation schemes.<br>
According to a preferred feature of the invention, the plurality of<br>
communication channels are communication channels of a single carrier.<br>
This may provide a flexible and targeted modification of a cell selection<br>
criterion in response to the characteristics of a specific carrier. In particular,<br>
the carrier may be a carrier which is monitored by a cell selection procedure.<br>
The carrier may for example be a frequency carrier of a TDMA system such as<br>
GSM.<br>
According to a preferred feature of the invention, the plurality of<br>
communication channels are communication channels of a pilot carrier. Cell<br>
selection is in many cellular communication systems based on signal level<br>
measurements of a pilot carrier and modifying the cell selection criterion in<br>
response to a modulation scheme distribution associated with the pilot carrier<br>
may provide improved cell selection performance and may in particular<br>
compensate or offset undesired biasing of cells due to the specific modulation<br>
schemes used. For an EDGE GSM cellular communication system, the pilot<br>
carrier may in particular be the BCCH carrier.<br>
According to a preferred feature of the invention, the plurality of<br>
communication channels are communication channels supporting an active<br>
communication. An active communication may in particular be a<br>
communication which has been ongoing during a time interval for which the<br>
 modulation scheme distribution has been determined. The modulation scheme<br>
distribution may specifically reflect a current modulation scheme distribution<br><br>
for a given time interval. The invention may thus provide for a dynamic<br>
modification of the cell selection criterion in response to the current<br>
modulation scheme utilisation. This may provide for an improved cell selection<br>
performance. It may alternatively or additionally facilitate network resource<br>
management as short term variations may automatically be compensated by<br>
the modification of the cell selection criterion.<br>
According to a preferred feature of the invention, the means for modifying is<br>
further operable to modify the cell selection criterion in response to a power<br>
characteristic associated with each modulation scheme. The power<br>
characteristic may be a parameter or a requirement associated with the<br>
modulation scheme, such as for example a peak to average power level<br>
measure. This may provide improved accuracy and improved cell selection<br>
performance.<br>
According to a preferred feature of the invention, the power characteristic is a<br>
linearity requirement. In particular, the power characteristic is preferably a<br>
power back-off requirement of a power amplifier. Typically, the power<br>
amplifier back-off required for different modulation schemes will result in<br>
transmit power variations between these, and modifying the cell selection<br>
criterion in response to these parameters may improve cell selection and in<br>
particular compensate or offset the bias introduced by the modulation<br>
schemes.<br>
According to a preferred feature of the invention, the means for modifying a<br>
cell selection criterion is operable to determine a cell selection power offset for<br>
a signal level measurement. This provides a particularly advantageous means<br>
of modifying the cell selection criterion. In particular, it allows easy<br>
implementation, provides high cell selection performance and/or is suitable for<br>
 cellular systems wherein cell selection is in response to signal level<br>
 measurements in the remote units. In EDGE GSM, the signal level<br><br>
measurements may particularly be mobile measurements of the received<br>
BCCH signal level.<br>
According to a preferred feature of the invention, the apparatus further<br>
comprises means for transmitting cell selection criterion modification<br>
information to remote units. This is particularly advantageous where cell<br>
selection is performed by the remote unit. The cell selection criterion<br>
modification information may specifically be cell selection power offsets to be<br>
applied to signal level measurements made by the remote unit and used for<br>
selecting a cell.<br>
According to a preferred feature of the invention, the apparatus further<br>
comprises^ means for determining a long term modulation scheme distribution<br>
for the plurality of communication channels, the long term modulation scheme<br>
distribution reflecting a distribution of modulation scheme usage determined<br>
over a longer time interval than for the modulation scheme distribution;<br>
means for determining a default cell selection criterion; and the means for<br>
modifying the cell selection criterion is operable to temporarily modify a<br>
parameter of the default cell selection criterion.<br>
This may allow a high performance cell selection algorithm and/or facilitate<br>
implementation. For example, a default cell selection criterion may be<br>
determined to suit the average conditions in the cellular communication<br>
system and this may be dynamically varied to suit the dynamic variations in<br>
modulation scheme utilisation.<br>
According to a preferred feature of the invention, the means for modifying is<br>
further operable to modify the cell selection criterion in response to a loading<br>
of the cell. This may improve cell selection and provide additional control of<br>
the resource distribution between cells.<br><br>
According to a preferred feature of the invention, the means for modifying is<br>
further operable to modify the cell selection criterion in response to a loading<br>
of a different cell of the cellular communication system. This may improve cell<br>
selection and provide additional control of the resource distribution between<br>
cells.<br>
According to a preferred feature of the invention, the modulation scheme<br>
distribution is determined for a plurality of cells. This may improve cell<br>
selection and provide additional control of the resource distribution between<br>
cells.<br>
According to a preferred feature of the invention, the means for determining<br>
the modulation scheme distribution is operable to determine the modulation<br>
scheme distribution in response to a number of active communications<br>
employing each supported modulation scheme. This may allow a simple and<br>
easy to implement way of determining a modulation scheme distribution<br>
suitable for modifying the cell selection criterion thereby improving the cell<br>
selection performance.<br>
According to a preferred feature of the invention, the modulation scheme<br>
distribution comprises a plurality of modulation scheme categories and an<br>
indication of a current usage level of the modulation schemes of each category.<br>
This may provide a simple modulation scheme distribution representing the<br>
current modulation scheme utilisation and is suitable for modifying the cell<br>
selection criterion thereby improving the cell selection performance.<br>
According to a preferred feature of the invention, the cell selection criterion is<br>
an idle mode cell selection criterion. The invention may provide improved idle<br>
mode cell selection performance thereby improving the performance of the<br>
cellular communication system as a whole.<br><br>
According to a preferred feature of the invention, the cell selection criterion is<br>
a handover criterion. The invention may provide improved handover cell<br>
selection performance thereby improving the performance of the cellular<br>
communication system as a whole.<br>
Preferably, the cellular communication system comprises EDGE<br>
communication means. The cellular communication system preferably<br>
comprises a GERAN (GSM EDGE Radio Access Network). In particular the<br>
cellular communication system may be an EDGE GSM cellular communication<br>
system.<br>
Preferably the cellular communication system comprises a first and second<br>
apparatus as described above and further comprising means for exchanging<br>
modulation scheme distribution information. This may provide a suitable way<br>
of communicating information allowing a modification of the cell selection<br>
criterion in response to the modulation scheme distribution of a plurality of<br>
cells.<br>
According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of<br>
controlling cell selection in a cellular communication system supporting a<br>
plurality of modulation schemes, the method comprising the steps of<br>
determining a modulation scheme distribution for a plurality of<br>
communication channels of at least one cell; and modifying a cell selection<br>
criterion in response to the modulation scheme distribution.<br>
These and other aspects, features and advantages of the invention will be<br>
apparent from and elucidated with reference to the embodiment(s) described<br>
hereinafter.<br><br>
An embodiment of the invention will be described, by way of example only,<br>
with reference to the drawings, in which<br>
FIG. 1 is an illustration of part of a cellular communication system in<br>
accordance with an embodiment of the invention; and<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates a method of controlling cell selection in accordance with an<br>
embodiment of the invention.<br>
Detailed Description of a Preferred Embodiment of the Invention<br>
The following description focuses on an embodiment of the invention<br>
i applicable to an EDGE GSM cellular communication system. However, it will<br>
be appreciated that the invention is not limited to this application but may be<br>
applied to many other cellular communication systems supporting a plurality<br>
of modulation schemes such as a combined 2nd and 3rd Generation cellular<br>
communication system.<br><br>
FIG. 1 is an illustration of part of a cellular communication system 100 in<br>
accordance with an embodiment of the invention.<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates a first base station 101 comprising an apparatus for<br>
 controlling cell selection in accordance with an embodiment of the invention.<br>
Only the parts of the base station 101 associated with the cell selection<br>
apparatus have been illustrated, and it will be apparent to the person skilled<br>
in the art that the base station 101 additionally comprises the required<br>
functionality for operating in accordance with the specifications of the cellular<br>
 communication system. The base station 101 is connected to a fixed network<br>
 103 which is further connected to other base stations of which one neighbour<br><br>
base station 105 is shown. FIG. 1 further illustrates a remote unit 107 which<br>
is in idle mode and situated in a location where it is able to receive signals<br>
from both the first base station 101 and the neighbour base station 105.<br>
The first base station 101 comprises a base station controller 109 which is<br>
operable to control the operation of the base station. In particular, the base<br>
station controller 109 interfaces with the fixed network 103 and controls the<br>
base station 101 to transmit user data and control messages in accordance<br>
with the requirements of the EDGE GSM cellular communication system.<br>
The base station controller 109 is coupled to a transmitter 111 which<br>
transmits signals to the remote units 107 over the EDGE GSM air interface in<br>
accordance with the EDGE GSM technical specifications. In particular the<br>
transmitter 111 is under the control of the base station controller 109 operable<br>
to transmit data using different modulation schemes. The modulation scheme<br>
used in each time slot depends on the service supported by that time slot and<br>
may also depend on the current propagation conditions. If a time slot is used to<br>
support a GSM communication, the transmitter uses GMSK modulation<br>
whereas a time slot supporting an EDGE communication may use an 8-PSK<br>
modulation scheme.<br>
The transmitter 111 comprises a power amplifier which amplifies the<br>
modulated signal to a suitable power level for transmission. For the constant<br>
amplitude modulation of GMSK, the power amplifier may be used up to the<br>
 maximum output power that can be provided by the power transmitter.<br>
However, for the linear non-constant amplitude modulation of 8-PSK, it is<br>
important that the power amplifier is used in a substantially linear region.<br>
This requires that the power amplifier is backed off and typically a back off of<br>
around 4 to 5 dBs are required. Accordingly, the maximum power output of the<br>
 power amplifier is around 4-5 dB lower for 8-PSK than for GMSK.<br><br>
In an EDGE GSM cellular communication system, the BCCH carrier is used<br>
as a pilot signal. The received signal level of the BCCH carrier is measured by<br>
the remote units and is used to determine a serving cell. In particular, idle<br>
mode mobiles measure the received BCCH signal levels of a number of base<br>
stations and select the cell being received with the highest signal level as the<br>
serving cell. Active remote units measure signal levels of a number of<br>
neighbouring cells and report these back to the base station and the fixed<br>
network for determining if a handover to another cell should be carried out.<br>
Hence, the remote unit 107 measures the BCCH signal from base station 101<br>
and base station 103 and cell selection is performed in response to these<br>
measurements in accordance with a suitable cell selection criterion. In the idle<br>
mode case, the remote unit 107 may simply select the base station having the<br>
highest received signal level.<br>
	In order to provide a suitable reference signal, power control is not performed<br>
on the BCCH carrier which instead is transmitted at the maximum power •<br>
level available from the base station. However, when different modulation<br>
schemes are used by the base station 201, the differences in the required back-<br>
off between constant amplitude and non-constant amplitude modulation<br>
 schemes result in the average transmit power being dependent on the<br>
modulation schemes used.<br>
As a specific example, the base station controller 109 may control the<br>
transmitter 111 to transmit a GMSK modulated signal in all time slots of the<br>
	BCCH carrier in which case the average transmit power within the<br>
measurement time interval of the remote unit (typically around five seconds)<br>
is the maximum power level of the power amplifier. However, at another time,<br>
seven out of eight time slots of the BCCH carrier which are available for user<br>
traffic may support EDGE communications using 8-PSK. Accordingly, the<br>
 power amplifier will be backed off by 4-5 dBs for seven out of the eight time<br>
slots, resulting in the received signal level at the remote unit 107 being<br><br>
reduced by around 4 dB. Thus, the transmit power level of the BCCH carrier<br>
may fluctuate in response to the applied modulation schemes resulting in a<br>
reduced performance of the cell selection process.<br>
The variation in transmit power of the BCCH can furthermore complicate<br>
resource management and reduce the capacity of the cellular communication<br>
system. For example, cells having a high number of EDGE communications<br>
supported by the BCCH will be measured with a lower signal level than if the<br>
cell supported fewer EDGE communications. This will tend to shift remote<br>
units away from EDGE supporting cells which may result in the cell being<br>
under loaded while neighbour cells are overloaded.<br>
The base station 101 of FIG. 2 further comprises a modulation scheme<br>
processor 113 which is operable to determine a modulation scheme<br>
distribution for a plurality of communication channels of the cell of the base<br>
station. The modulation scheme processor 113 is coupled to a cell selection<br>
processor 115 which is operable to modify a cell selection criterion in response<br>
to the modulation scheme distribution. In the described embodiment, the cell<br>
selection processor 115 is coupled to the transmitter 111 in order to transmit<br>
information of the modifications to the cell selection criterion to the remote<br>
units of the cell. The information of the modifications of the cell selection<br>
criterion may be communicated on the BCCH broadcast channel thereby being<br>
broadcast to all remote units capable of receiving the BCCH signal.<br>
The modulation scheme processor'113 may determine the modulation scheme<br>
distribution in accordance with any suitable method or algorithm. The<br>
modulation scheme distribution is an indication of the modulation scheme<br>
utilisation. In particular, the modulation scheme distribution may reflect<br>
which modulation schemes may currently active or which modulation schemes<br>
are allocated to different time slots, channels and/or carriers. Specifically, the<br>
modulation scheme distribution may be an indication of the modulation<br><br>
scheme utilisation which allows for the impact on the transmit power of a base<br>
station to be determined.<br>
The cell selection processor 115 may determine a modification to a cell<br>
selection criterion which takes into account the modulation scheme utilisation,<br>
and in particular the cell selection criterion may be modified to compensate for<br>
a change in the transmit power of a base station caused by the modulation<br>
schemes used. It will be appreciated that any suitable cell selection criterion or<br>
modification thereof may be used without detracting from the invention. For<br>
example, a cell selection algorithm may comprise a number of alternative<br>
conditions for selecting a cell and the modification of the cell selection criterion<br>
may be achieved by selecting a specific condition to apply for cell selection. In<br>
other embodiments, a parameter or relationship used by the cell selection<br>
algorithm may be modified in response to the modulation scheme distribution.<br>
Hence, the embodiment may allow a cell selection criterion to be modified to<br>
compensate for variations in the modulation schemes used. This may improve<br>
cell selection performance, enhance and facilitate the control of the cell<br>
selection and increase the capacity of the communication system as a whole.<br>
A specific example of the operation of the EDGE GSM communication system,<br>
wherein power variations of the BCCH carrier are compensated, will be<br>
described in the following. FIG. 2 illustrates a method of controlling cell<br>
selection in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. The method is in<br>
the following example performed by the base station 101 of FIG. 1 and will be<br>
described with reference to this. The example is suitable for a cell selection<br>
algorithm for idle mode remote units where the cell selection criterion is<br>
applied by the remote unit and is based on BCCH signal level measurements<br>
made by the remote unit. Specifically, the remote unit may select the cell<br>
 having the highest received signal level after compensation.<br><br>
In the example, the modulation scheme processor 113 determines a<br>
modulation scheme distribution in step 201. The modulation scheme<br>
distribution is determined in response to the communication channels of a<br>
single carrier and specifically the modulation scheme distribution is<br>
determined for the pilot carrier in the form of the BCCH carrier.<br>
In addition, the modulation scheme distribution is determined to reflect the<br>
current dynamic conditions and is thus determined for the communication<br>
channels supporting an active communication. Thus, the modulation scheme<br>
distribution is determined by evaluating which modulation schemes are used<br>
in the time slots of the BCCH carrier.<br>
Furthermore, the modulation scheme distribution is determined in response to<br>
a number of active communications employing each supported modulation<br>
scheme. The modulation scheme distribution of the described embodiment<br>
comprises a plurality of modulation scheme categories. As a simple example,<br>
the modulation scheme of each time slot is either a GMSK modulation scheme<br>
or an 8-PSK modulation scheme and the modulation scheme distribution<br>
therefore simply comprises a first category corresponding to GMSK<br>
modulation and a second category corresponding to 8-PSK modulation.<br>
In the example, the modulation scheme distribution comprises an indication of<br>
a current usage level of the modulation schemes of each category and in<br>
particular the modulation scheme distribution comprises an indication of the<br>
number of time slots currently using GMSK and the number of time slots<br>
currently using 8-PSK.<br>
As a specific example, the BCCH carrier may use GMSK for the control time<br>
slot 0, 8-PSK in time slots 1 to 4 and GMSK in time slot 5 to 7. The modulation<br>
scheme processor 113 will be provided with this information from the base<br>
station controller 209 and will accordingly generate a modulation scheme<br><br>
distribution indicating that 4 time slots fall in the GMSK category and 4 time<br>
slots fall in the 8-PSK category.<br>
Step 201 is followed by step 203 wherein the cell selection processor 115<br>
determines a modification to the cell selection criterion. In the example, the<br>
modification is effected by setting a cell selection power offset. The cell<br>
selection power offset corresponds to an offset which is to be applied to the<br>
signal level measurements of the BCCH carrier performed by the remote unit<br>
107.<br><br>
In the example, the cell selection processor 115 determines the cell selection<br>
power offset in response to the modulation scheme distribution and a power<br>
characteristic associated with each modulation scheme. The power<br>
characteristic is in this example a characteristic which is indicative of the<br>
 transmit power that is used for the specific modulation scheme. In the specific<br>
embodiment, the power reduction of the transmit power depends on the<br>
linearity required by the power amplifier. Typically, the higher the linearity<br>
requirement for a modulation scheme the higher the required back off of the<br>
transmit power amplifier and thus the lower the maximum transmit power.<br><br>
As a specific example, the cell selection processor 115 may have information<br>
that for a GMSK signal no back-off is required whereas for an 8-PSK signal a<br>
back off of 6 dB is required in order to meet the linearity requirement for the<br>
non-constant amplitude modulation scheme. Hence, when receiving a<br>
 modulation scheme distribution from the modulation scheme processor 113<br>
indicating that the BCCH carrier uses GMSK in four time slots and QPSK in<br>
four time slots, the cell selection processor 115 determines that the power<br>
amplifier is backed off by 6 dB, and thus that the output power is reduced by 6<br>
dB for half the duration. Thus, the average transmit power is 3 dB lower than<br>
 the transmit power if all time slots use GMSK modulation. Hence, the cell<br>
selection processor 115 determines a cell selection power offset of 3 dB which is<br><br>
to be applied to measurements of the BCCH carrier of base station 101 made<br>
by the remote unit 107.<br>
Step 203 is followed by step 205 wherein the cell selection power offset is fed<br>
from the cell selection processor 115 to the transmitter 111 for transmission to<br>
the remote units. Thus, the base station 201 transmits cell selection criterion<br>
modification information in the form of the cell selection power offset to remote<br>
units. In particular, the base station may broadcast the cell selection power<br>
offset by including it in a system information message of the BCCH carrier.<br>
In the example, the remote unit 107 is in idle mode and performs a cell<br>
selection in response the received signal level measurements of the BCCH<br>
carriers of the surrounding base stations. In particular, the remote unit<br>
receives the BCCH carrier of the first and second base station 101, 103 and<br>
 measures the signal level averaged over a time interval (e.g. 5 seconds). In<br>
addition, the remote unit demodulates time slot 0 of the BCCH carriers and<br>
decodes the transmitted system information messages. The system<br>
information messages from the first base station comprises the cell selection<br>
power offset and the remote unit adds the cell selection power offset to the<br>
 measured signal level of the first base station 101. Thus, 3 dB is in the specific<br>
example added to the signal level measurement of the first base station 101<br>
thereby, compensating for the reduction of transmit power caused by the use of<br>
8-PSK modulation in four time slots.<br>
 In the embodiment, the signal level measurements are compensated for<br>
transmit power variations caused by the use of different modulation schemes<br>
and cell selection may be performed on the basis of the compensated signal<br>
levels. In particular, the remote unit may select the base station resulting in<br>
the highest compensated signal level corresponding to the lowest propagation<br>
 loss. Thus, improved cell selection may be achieved.<br><br>
In the described embodiment, a default cell selection criterion consisting in<br>
selecting the cell having the highest received signal level is modified by<br>
dynamically compensating the measured signal levels in response to the<br>
current modulation scheme distribution. Thus, a default cell selection criterion<br>
based on an assumption of a maximum transmit power is temporarily modified<br>
by introducing a cell selection power offset representing transmit power<br>
variations due to the actual modulation schemes used.<br>
In some embodiments, the default cell selection criterion is not simply based<br>
on a static assumption but is based on a long term evaluation of the<br>
modulation scheme distribution. Thus, the base station 201 may in such an<br>
embodiment comprise means for determining a long term modulation scheme<br>
distribution. The long term modulation scheme distribution is determined over<br>
a longer time interval than for the modulation scheme distribution determined<br>
by the modulation scheme processor 113. In particular, the long term<br>
modulation scheme distribution may be determined, by averaging the<br>
modulation scheme distribution over a suitable time interval. For example, a<br>
new modulation scheme distribution may be determined at ten minute<br>
intervals whereas the long term modulation scheme distribution may be<br>
 determined on a daily or weekly basis.<br>
In the embodiment, the long term modulation scheme distribution thus<br>
reflects the long term average modulation scheme utilisation whereas the<br>
modulation scheme distribution reflects the short term variations. The base<br>
 station may in response to the long term modulation scheme distribution<br>
determine a default cell selection criterion suitable for the average conditions.<br>
For example, the default cell selection criterion may be a comparison between<br>
measured signal levels assuming a transmit power equal to the average<br>
transmit power for the long term modulation scheme distribution. The base<br>
 station may further vary this temporarily in response to the modulation<br><br>
scheme distribution, for example by applying temporary cell selection power<br>
offsets.<br>
It will be appreciated that the cell selection processor 115 may consider other<br>
parameters or characteristics when modifying the cell selection criterion than<br>
the modulation scheme distribution.<br>
For example, in some embodiments, the cell selection processor 115 may<br>
further modify the cell selection criterion in response to a loading of the cell<br>
and/or of other cells.<br>
In a specific such embodiment, the cell selection criterion is only modified if<br>
the cell or one of the surrounding cells is loaded above a given level. Thus, in<br>
situations where no cell is in danger of being overloaded, no modification is<br>
made to the cell selection criterion as this is unlikely to be critical or result in<br>
reduced performance. However, in situations where the cell selection is critical<br>
because one or more of the involved cells may be approaching congestion, a<br>
more accurate cell selection criterion may be used which more closely reflects<br>
the actual conditions and therefore provides an improved cell selection.<br>
In the described embodiment, the modulation scheme distribution was<br>
determined only for one cell. However, it will be appreciated that in other<br>
embodiments, the modulation scheme distribution may reflect the modulation<br>
scheme utilisation of a plurality of cells.<br>
For example, the modulation scheme processor 113 may receive information<br>
from other base stations indicating which modulation schemes are used in the<br>
time slots of the BCCH carriers of those cells. The modulation scheme<br>
distribution may for example comprise information that in base station 101<br>
four time slots use GMSK and four time slots use 8-PSK and that in the<br>
' second base station 103 six time slots use GMSK and two time slots use 8"<br><br>
PSK. In response, the cell selection processor 115 may for example determine<br>
a cell selection power offset reflecting' the average transmit power difference<br>
between the first base station 101 and the second base station 105 rather than<br>
a relative offset to the maximum transmit power of the base station itself.<br>
Hence, in the example, a cell selection power offset of 1.8 dB may be<br>
transmitted to the remote unit 107 to be applied when comparing the signal<br>
level measurements of the first and second base station.<br>
Furthermore, in some embodiments different cells may autonomously<br>
determine suitable cell selection power offsets and transmit these. For<br>
example, in an EDGE GMSK systems the remote units decode the BCCH of<br>
not only the serving cell but also of the neighbour cells being monitored. In<br>
this case, each base station may determine a suitable cell selection power<br>
offsets for the cell supported by the base station and may transmit this<br>
information on the BCCH. The remote unit will thus receive suitable cell<br>
selection power offsets from the neighbour cells and may apply these to the<br>
appropriate BCCH signal level measurements.<br>
In some embodiments, only the pilot signal of the currently selected cell is<br>
decoded. For example, for packet communication using a PBCCH (Packet<br>
BCCH), the remote unit decodes only that of the serving cell and the<br>
neighbour cell data is broadcast on the PBCCH of the serving cell. In this<br>
embodiment, neighbouring cells may exchange information related e.g. to the<br>
cell selection power offsets of the cells and the cell selection power offsets for<br>
both the serving cell and neighbouring cells may be broadcast on the PBCCH<br>
of the serving cell.<br>
The above description has focussed on an embodiment wherein an idle mode<br>
remote unit performs cell selection in response to measurements and<br>
information transmitted from a base station. However, it will be appreciated<br>
 that the cell selection may be performed at other locations and in particular<br><br>
may be performed in the network. Thus, not only the cell selection processor<br>
modifying the cell selection criterion but also the cell selection algorithm itself<br>
may be performed in the network. The cell selection may thus be performed in<br>
the base station, in the fixed network or may be distributed between these.<br>
For example, the cell selection may be a handover cell selection performed in a<br>
BSC based on measurements of BCCHs made by the remote unit 107 and<br>
transmitted to the base station 101. In such an example, each base station<br>
may comprise a modulation scheme processor 113 determining a current<br>
modulation scheme distribution and reporting this to the BSC. The BSC may<br>
then proceed to offset all neighbour measurements from the remote unit 107<br>
by a value indicative of the transmit power reduction due to the modulation<br>
schemes used of the individual base station. Hence, an improved handover<br>
performance may be achieved.<br>
The invention can be implemented in any suitable form including hardware,<br>
software, firmware or any combination of these. However, preferably, the<br>
invention is implemented at least partly as computer software running on one<br>
or more data processors and/or digital signal processors. The elements and<br>
components of an embodiment of the invention may be physically, functionally<br>
and logically implemented in any suitable way. Indeed the functionality may<br>
be implemented in a single unit, in a plurality of units or as part of other<br>
functional units. As such, the invention may be implemented in a single unit<br>
or may be physically and functionally distributed between different units and<br>
processors.<br>

preferred embodiment, it is not intended to be limited to the specific form set<br>
forth herein. Rather, the scope of the present invention is limited only by the<br>
accompanying claims. In the claims, the term comprising does not exclude the<br>

A base station (101) may transmit using different modulation schemes. The transmit power of a pilot<br>

due to varying power amplifier back-up requirements. The base station (101) comprises a modulation<br>
scheme processor (113) determining a modulation scheme distribution for a plurality of communication<br>
channels of the cell. The modulation scheme distribution reflects the current modulation scheme<br>
utilisation for the pilot signal and is indicative of the power variation of the pilot signal. A cell selection<br>
processor (115) modifies a cell selection criterion in response to the modulation scheme distribution. In<br>
particular, the cell selection processor (115) determines a cell selection power offset to be applied to<br>
measurements of the signal levels of the pilot signal. The cell selection power offset preferably<br>
corresponds to the average power variation resulting from the current modulation scheme utilisation<br>
thereby allowing this to be compensated.</td>
