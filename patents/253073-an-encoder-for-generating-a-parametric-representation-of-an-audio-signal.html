Multi-Channel Hierarchical Audio Coding with Compact Side-<br>
Information<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to multi-channel audio proc-<br>
essing and, in particular, to the generation and the use of<br>
compact parametric side information to describe the spatial<br>
properties of a multi-channel audio signal.<br>
Background of the invention and prior art<br>
In recent times, the multi-channel audio reproduction tech-<br>
nique is becoming more and more important. This may be due<br>
to the fact that audio compression/encoding techniques such<br>
as the wel1-known mp3 technique have made it possible to<br>
distribute audio records via the Internet or other trans-<br>
mission channels having a limited bandwidth. The mp3 coding<br>
technique has become so famous because of the fact that it<br>
allows distribution of all the records in a stereo format,<br>
i.e., a digital representation of the audio record includ-<br>
ing a first or left stereo channel and a second or right<br>
stereo channel.<br>
Nevertheless, there are basic shortcomings of conventional<br>
two-channel sound systems. Therefore, the surround tech-<br>
nique has been developed. A recommended multi-channe1-<br>
surround presentation format includes, in addition to two<br>
stereo channels L and R, an additional center channel C and<br>
two surround channels Ls, Rs. This reference sound format<br>
is also referred to as three/two-stereo, which means three<br>
front channels and two surround channels. In a playback en-<br>
vironment, at least five speakers at five appropriate loca-<br>
tions are needed to get an optimum sweet spot in a certain<br>
distance of the five wel1-placed loudspeakers.<br><br>
Recent approaches for the parametric coding of multi-<br>
channel audio signals (parametric stereo (PS), "spatial au-<br>
dio coding", "binaural cue coding" (BCC) etc.) represent a<br>
multi-channel audio signal by means of a downmix signal<br>
(could be monophonic or comprise several channels) and pa-<br>
rametric side information ("spatial cues"), characterizing<br>
its perceived spatial sound stage. The different approaches<br>
and techniques shall be reviewed shortly in the following<br>
paragraphs.<br>
A related technique, also known as parametric stereo, is<br>
described in J. Breebaart, S. van de Par, A. Kohlrausch, E.<br>
Schuijers, "High-Quality Parametric Spatial Audio Coding at<br>
Low Bitrates", AES 116th Convention, Berlin, Preprint 6072,<br>
May 2004, and E. Schuijers, J. Breebaart, H. Purnhagen, J.<br>
Engdegard, "Low Complexity Parametric Stereo Coding", AES<br>
116th Convention, Berlin, Preprint 6073, May 2004.<br>
Several techniques are known in the art for reducing the<br>
amount of data required for transmission of a multi-channel<br>
audio signal. To this end, reference is made to Fig. 11,<br>
which shows a joint stereo device 60. This device can be a<br>
device implementing e.g. intensity stereo (IS) or binaural<br>
cue coding (BCC). Such a device generally receives - as an<br>
input - at least two channels (CH1, CH2, ... CHn) , and out-<br>
puts a single carrier channel and parametric data. The pa-<br>
rametric data are defined such that, in a decoder, an ap-<br>
proximation of an original channel (CH1, CH2, ... CHn) can be<br>
calculated.<br>
Normally, the carrier channel will include subband samples,<br>
spectral coefficients, time domain samples etc., which pro-<br>
vide a comparatively fine representation of the underlying<br>
signal, while the parametric data does not include such<br>
samples of spectral coefficients but include control pa-<br>
rameters for controlling a certain reconstruction algorithm<br>
such as weighting by multiplication, time shifting, fre-<br>
quency shifting, phase shifting, etc. The parametric data,<br><br>
therefore, includes only a comparatively coarse representa-<br>
tion of the signal or the associated channel. Stated in<br>
numbers, the amount of data required by a carrier channel<br>
can be in the range of 60 - 70 kbit/s in an MPEG coding<br>
scheme, while the amount of data required by parametric<br>
side information for one channel may be in the range of<br>
about 10 kbit/s for a 5.1 channel signal. An example for<br>
parametric data are the wel1-known scale factors, intensity<br>
stereo information or binaural cue parameters as will be<br>
described below.<br>
The BCC Technique is for example described in the AES con-<br>
vention paper 5574, "Binaural Cue Coding applied to Stereo<br>
and Multi-Channel Audio Compression", C. Faller,<br>
F. Baumgarte, May 2002, Munich, in the IEEE WASPAA Paper<br>
"Efficient representation of spatial audio using perceptual<br>
parametrization", October 2001, Mohonk, NY, and in the<br>
2 ICASSP Papers "Estimation of. auditory spatial cues for<br>
binaural cue coding", and "Binaural cue coding: a novel and<br>
efficient representation of spatial audio", both authored<br>
by C. Faller, and F. Baumgarte, Orlando, FL, May 2002.<br>
In BCC encoding, a number of audio input channels are con-<br>
verted to a spectral representation using a DFT (Discrete<br>
Fourier Transform) based transform with overlapping win-<br>
dows. The resulting spectrum is divided into non-<br>
overlapping partitions. Each partition has a bandwidth pro-<br>
portional to the equivalent rectangular bandwidth (ERB).<br>
The inter-channel level differences (ICLD) and the inter-<br>
channel time differences (ICTD) are estimated for each par-<br>
tition. The inter-channel level differences ICLD and inter-<br>
channel time differences ICTD are normally given for each<br>
channel with respect to a reference channel and furthermore<br>
quantized. The transmitted parameters are finally calcu-<br>
lated in accordance with prescribed formulae (encoded) ,<br>
which may depend on the specific partitions of the signal<br>
to be processed.<br><br>
At a decoder-side, the decoder receives a mono signal and<br>
the BCC bit stream. The mono signal is transformed into the<br>
frequency domain and input into a spatial synthesis block,<br>
which also receives decoded ICLD and ICTD values. In the<br>
spatial synthesis block, the BCC parameters (ICLD and ICTD)<br>
values are used to perform a weighting operation of the<br>
mono signal in order to synthesize the multi-channel sig-<br>
nals, which, after a frequency/time conversion, represent a<br>
reconstruction of the original multi-channel audio signal.<br>
In case of BCC, the joint stereo module 60 is operative to<br>
output the channel side information such that the paramet-<br>
ric channel data are quantized and encoded resulting in<br>
ICLD or ICTD parameters, wherein one of the original chan-<br>
nels is used as the reference channel while coding the<br>
channel side information.<br>
Normally, the carrier channel is formed of the sum of the<br>
participating original channels.<br>
Therefore, the above techniques additionally provide a<br>
suitable mono representation for playback equipment that<br>
can only process the carrier channel and is not able to<br>
process the parametric data for generating one or more ap-<br>
proximations of more than one input channel.<br>
The audio coding technique known as binaural cue coding<br>
(BCC) is also well described in the United States patent<br>
application publications US 2003, 0219130 Al, 2003/0026441<br>
Al and 2003/0035553 A1. Additional reference is also made<br>

tions", C. Faller and F. Baumgarte, IEEE Trans, on Audio<br>
and Speech Proc, Vol. 11, No. 6, Nov. 2003 and to "Binau-<br>
ral cue coding applied to audio compression with flexible<br>
rendering", C. Faller and F. Baumgarte, AES 113th Conven-<br>
tion, Los Angeles, October 2002. The cited United States<br>
patent application publications and the two cited technical<br><br>
publications on the BCC technique authored by Faller and<br>
Baumgarte are incorporated herein by reference in their en-<br>

Although ICLD and ICTD parameters represent the most impor-<br>
tant sound source localization parameters, a spatial repre-<br>
sentation using these parameters only limits the maximum<br>
quality that can be achieved. To overcome this limitation,<br>
and hence to enable high-quality parametric coding,<br>
Parametric stereo (as described in J. Breebaart, S. van de<br>
Par, A. Kohlrausch, E. Schuijers (2005) "Parametric coding<br>
of stereo audio", Eurasip J. Applied Signal Proc. 9, 1305-<br>
1322) applies three types of spatial parameters, referred<br>
to as Interchannel Intensity Differences (IIDs), Interchan-<br>
nel Phase Differences (IPDs), and Interchannel Coherence<br>
(IC) . The extension of the spatial parameter set with co-<br>
herence parameters enables a parameterization of the per-<br>
ceived spatial Miffuseness' or spatial ^compactness' of<br>
the sound stage.<br>
In the following, a typical generic BCC scheme for multi-<br>
channel audio coding is elaborated in more detail with ref-<br>
erence to Figures 12 to 14. Figure 9 shows such a generic<br>
binaural cue coding scheme for coding/transmission of<br>
multi-channel audio signals. The multi-channel audio input<br>
signal at an input 110 of a BCC encoder 112 is downmixed in<br>
a downmix block 114. In the present example, the original<br>
multi-channel signal at the input 110 is a 5-channel sur-<br>
round signal having a front left channel, a front right<br>
channel, a left surround channel, a right surround channel<br>
and a center channel. In a preferred embodiment of the pre-<br>
sent invention, the downmix block 114 produces a sum signal<br>
by a simple addition of these five channels into a mono<br>
signal. Other downmixing schemes are known in the art such<br>
that, using a multi-channel input signal, a downmix signal<br>
having a single channel can be obtained. This single chan-<br>
nel is output at a sum signal line 115. A side information<br>
obtained by a BCC analysis block 116 is output at a side<br><br>
information line 117. in the BCC analysis block, inter-<br>
channel level differences (ICLD), and inter-channel time<br>
differences (ICTD) are calculated as has been outlined<br>
above. The BCC analysis block 116 is formed to also calcu-<br>
late inter-channel correlation values (ICC values). The sum<br>
signal and the side information is transmitted, preferably<br>
in a quantized and encoded form, to a BCC decoder 120. The<br>
BCC decoder decomposes the transmitted sum signal into a<br>
number of subbands and applies scaling, delays and other<br>
processing to generate the subbands of the output multi-<br>
channel audio signals. This processing is performed such<br>
that ICLD, ICTD and ICC parameters (cues) of a recon-<br>
structed multi-channel signal at an output 121 are similar<br>
to the respective cues for the original multi-channel sig-<br>
nal at the input 110 of the BCC encoder 112. To this end,<br>
the BCC decoder 120 includes a BCC synthesis block 122 and<br>
a side information processing block 123.<br>
In the following, the internal construction of the BCC syn-<br>
thesis block 122 is explained with reference to Fig. 13.<br>
The sum signal on line 115 is input into a time/frequency<br>
conversion unit or filter bank FB 125. At the output of<br>
block 125, a number N of sub band signals are present, or,<br>
in an extreme case, a block of spectral coefficients, when<br>
the audio filter bank 125 performs a 1:1 transform, i.e., a<br>
transform which produces N spectral coefficients from N<br>
time domain samples (critical subsampling).<br>
The BCC synthesis block 122 further comprises a delay stage<br>
126, a level modification stage 127, a correlation process-<br>
ing stage 128 and an inverse filter bank stage IFB 129. At<br>
the output of stage 129, the reconstructed multi-channel<br>
audio signal having for example five channels in case of a<br>
5-channel surround system, can be output to a set of loud-<br>
speakers 124 as illustrated in Fig. 12.<br>
As shown in Fig. 13, the input signal s(n) is converted<br>
into the frequency domain or filter bank domain by means of<br><br>
element 125. The signal output by element 125 is multiplied<br>
such that several versions of the same signal are obtained<br>
as illustrated by branching node 130. The number of ver-<br>
sions of the original signal is equal to the number of out-<br>
put channels in the output signal to be reconstructed.<br>
When, in general, each version of the original signal at<br>
node 130 is subjected to a certain delay d1, d2, ..., d1, ...,<br>
dN. The delay parameters are computed by the side informa-<br>
tion processing block 123 in Fig. 12 and are derived from<br>
the inter-channel time differences as determined by the BCC<br>
analysis block 116.<br>
The same is true for the multiplication parameters a1, a2,<br>
..., ai., ..., aN, which are also calculated by the side infor-<br>
mation processing block 123 based on the inter-channel<br>
level differences as calculated by the BCC analysis block<br>
116.<br>
The ICC parameters calculated by the BCC analysis block 116<br>
are used for controlling the functionality of block 128<br>
such that certain correlations between the delayed and<br>
leve1-manipulated signals are obtained at the outputs of<br>
block 128. It is to be noted here that the ordering of the<br>
stages 126, 127, 128 may be different from the case shown<br>
in Fig. 13.<br>
One should be aware that, in a frame-wise processing of an<br>
audio signal, the BCC analysis is also performed frame-<br>
wise, i.e. time-varying, and also frequency-wise. This<br>
means that, for each spectral band, the BCC parameters are<br>
obtained individually. This further means that, in case the<br>
audio filter bank 125 decomposes the input signal into for<br>
example 32 band pass signals, the BCC analysis block ob-<br>
tains a set of BCC parameters for each of the 32 bands.<br>
Naturally the BCC synthesis block 122 from Fig. 12, which<br>
is shown in detail in Fig. 13, performs a reconstruction,<br>
which is also based on the 32 bands in the example.<br><br>
In the following, reference is made to Fig. 14 showing a<br>
setup to determine certain BCC parameters. Normally, ICLD,<br>
ICTD and ICC parameters can be defined between arbitrary<br>
pairs of channels. One method, that will be outlined here,<br>
consists of ICLD and ICTD parameters between a reference<br>
channel and each other channel. This is illustrated in Fig.<br>
14A.<br>
ICC parameters can be defined in different ways. Most gen-<br>
erally, one could estimate ICC parameters in the encoder<br>
between all possible channel pairs as indicated in Fig.<br>
14B. In this case, a decoder would synthesize ICC such that<br>
it is approximately the same as in the original multi-<br>
channel signal between all possible channel pairs. It was,<br>
however, proposed to estimate only ICC parameters between<br>
the strongest two channels at a time. This scheme is illus-<br>
trated in Fig. 14C, where an example is shown, in which at<br>
one time instance, an ICC parameter is estimated between<br>
channels 1 and 2, and, at another time instance, an ICC pa-<br>
rameter is calculated between channels 1 and 5. The decoder<br>
then synthesizes the inter-channel correlation between the<br>
strongest channels in the decoder and applies some heuris-<br>
tic rule for computing and synthesizing the inter-channel<br>
coherence for the remaining channel pairs.<br>
Regarding the calculation of, for example, the multiplica-<br>
tion parameters a1, ...,aN based on transmitted ICLD parame-<br>
ters, reference is made to AES convention paper 5574 cited<br>
above. The ICLD parameters represent an energy distribution<br>
in an original multi-channel signal. Without loss of gener-<br>
ality, it is shown in Fig. 14A that there are four ICLD pa-<br>
rameters showing the energy difference between all other<br>
channels and the front left channel. In the side informa-<br>
tion processing block 123, the multiplication parameters<br>
a1, ..., aN are derived from the ICLD parameters such that the<br>
total energy of all reconstructed output channels is the<br>
same as (or proportional to) the energy of the transmitted<br>
sum signal. A simple way for determining these parameters<br><br>
is a 2-stage process, in which, in a first stage, the mul-<br>
tiplication factor for the left front channel is set to<br>
unity, while multiplication factors for the other channels<br>
in Fig. 14A are determined from the transmitted ICLD val-<br>
ues. Then, in a second stage, the energy of all five chan-<br>
nels is calculated and compared to the energy of the trans-<br>
mitted sum signal. Then, all channels are downscaled using<br>
a downscaling factor which is equal for all channels,<br>
wherein the downscaling factor is selected such that the<br>
total energy of all reconstructed output channels is, after<br>
downscaling, equal to the total energy of the transmitted<br>
sum signal.<br>
Naturally, there are also other methods for calculating the<br>
multiplication factors, which do not rely on the 2-stage<br>
process but which only need a 1-stage process.<br>
Regarding the delay parameters, it is to be noted that the<br>
delay parameters ICTD, which are transmitted from a BCC en-<br>
coder can be used directly, when the delay parameter d1 for<br>
the left front channel is set to zero. No rescaling has to<br>
be done here, since a delay does not alter the energy of<br>
the signal.<br>
As has been outlined above with respect to Fig. 14, the pa-<br>
rametric side information, i.e., the interchannel level<br>
differences (ICLD), the interchannel time differences<br>
(ICTD) or the interchannel coherence parameter (ICC) can be<br>
calculated and transmitted for each of the five channels.<br>
This means that one, normally, transmits four sets of in-<br>
terchannel level differences for a five channel signal. The<br>
same is true for the interchannel time differences. With<br>
respect to the interchannel coherence parameter, it can<br>
also be sufficient to only transmit for example two sets of<br>
these parameters.<br><br>
As has been outlined above with respect to Fig. 13, there<br>
is not a single level difference parameter, time difference<br>
parameter or coherence parameter for one frame or time por-<br>
tion of a signal. Instead, these parameters are determined<br>
for several different frequency bands so that a frequency-<br>
dependent parametrization is obtained. Since it is pre-<br>
ferred to use for example 32 frequency channels, i.e., a<br>
filter bank having 32 frequency bands for BCC analysis and<br>
BCC synthesis, the parameters can occupy quite a lot of<br>
data. Although - compared to other multi-channel transmis-<br>
sions - the parametric representation results in a quite<br>
low data rate, there is a continuing need for further re-<br>
duction of the necessary data rate to represent a signal<br>
having more than two channels such as a multi-channel sur-<br>
round signal.<br>
The encoding of a multi-channel audio signal can be advan-<br>
tageously implemented using several existing modules, which<br>
perform a parametric stereo coding into a single mono-<br>
channel. The international patent application<br>
WO2004008805 A1 teaches how parametric stereo coders can be<br>
ordered in a hierarchical set-up such, that a given number<br>
of input audio channels are subsequently downmixed into one<br>
single mono-channel. The parametric side information, de-<br>
scribing the spatial properties of the downmix mono-<br>
channel, finally consists of all the parametric information<br>
subsequently produced during the iterative downmixing pro-<br>
cess. This means, that, if there are, for example, three<br>
stereo-to-mono downmixing processes involved in building<br>
the final mono signal, the final set of parameters building<br>
the parametric representation of the multi-channel audio<br>
signal consists of the three sets of the parameters derived<br>
during every single stereo-to-mono downmixing process.<br>
A hierarchical downmixing encoder is shown in Fig. 15, to<br>
explain the method of the prior art in more detail. Fig. 15<br>
shows six original audio channels 200a to 200f that are<br>
transformed into a single monophonic audio channel 202 plus<br><br>
parametric side information. Therefore, the six original<br>
audio channels 200a to 200f have to be transformed from the<br>
time domain into the frequency domain, which is performed<br>
by transforming units 204, transforming the audio chan-<br>
nels 200a to 200f into the corresponding channels 206a to<br>
206f in the frequency domain. Following the hierarchical<br>
approach, the channels 206a to 206f are pair-wise downmixed<br>
into three monophonic channels L, R and C (208a, 208b and<br>
208c, respectively). During the downmixing of the three<br>
pairs of channels a parameter set is derived for each chan-<br>
nel pair, describing the spatial properties of the original<br>
stereophonic signal, downmixed into a monophonic signal.<br>
Thus, in this first downmixing step, three parameter sets<br>
210a to 210c are generated to preserve the spatial informa-<br>
tion of the signals 206a to 206f.<br>
In the next step of the hierarchical downmixing, chan-<br>
nels 208a and 208b are downmixed into a channel 212 (LR) ,<br>
generating a parameter set 210d (parameter set 4. To fi-<br>
nally derive only one single monophonic channel, a downmix-<br>
ing of the channels 208c and 212 is necessary, resulting in<br>
channel 214 (M) . This generates a fifth parameter set 210e<br>
(parameter set 5). Finally, the downmixed monophonic audio<br>
signal 214 is inversely transformed into the time domain to<br>
derive an audio signal 202 that can be played by standard<br>
equipment.<br>
As described above, a parametric representation of the<br>
downmix audio signal 202 according to the prior art con-<br>
sists of all the parameter sets 210a to 210e, which means<br>
that if one wants to rebuild the original multi-channel au-<br>
dio signal (channels 200a to 200f) from the monophonic au-<br>
dio signal 202, all the parameter sets 210a to 210e are re-<br>
quired as side information of the monophonic downmix signal<br>
202.<br>
The US-patent application 11/032,689 (from here only re-<br>
ferred to as "prior art cue combination") describes a proc-<br><br>
ess for combining several cue values into a single trans-<br>
mitted one in order to save side information in a non-<br>
hierarchical coding scheme. To do so, all the channels are<br>
downmixed first and the cue codes are later on combined to<br>
form transmitted cue values (could also be one single<br>
value), the combination being dependent on a predefined<br>
mathematical function, in which the spatial parameters,<br>
that are derived directly from the input signals, are put<br>
in as variables.<br>
State-of-the-art techniques for the parametric coding of<br>
two ("stereo") or more ("multi-channel") audio input chan-<br>
nels derive the spatial parameters directly from the input<br>
signals. Examples of such parameters are inter-channel<br>
level differences (ICLD) or inter-channel intensity differ-<br>
ences (IID), inter-channel time delay (ICTD) or inter-<br>
channel phase differences (IPD), and inter-channel correla-<br>
tion/coherence (ICC), each of which are transmitted in a<br>
frequency-selective fashion, i.e. per frequency band. The<br>
application of the prior art cue combination teaches that<br>
several cue values can be combined to a single value that<br>
is transmitted from the encoder to the decoder side. The<br>
decoding process uses the transmitted single value instead<br>
of the originally individually transmitted cue values to<br>
reconstruct the multi-channel output signal. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, this scheme has been applied to the ICC parame-<br>
ters. It has been shown that this leads to a considerable<br>
reduction in the size of the cue side information while<br>
preserving the spatial quality of the vast majority of sig-<br>
nals. It is, however, not clear how this can be exploited<br>
in a hierarchical coding scheme.<br>
The patent application on prior art cue combination has de-<br>
tailed the principle of the invention by an example for a<br>
system based on two transmitted downmix channels. In the<br>
proposed method, with reference to figure 15, ICC values of<br>
Lf/Lr and Rf/Rr channel pairs are combined into a single<br>
transmitted ICC parameter. The two combined ICC values have<br><br>
been obtained during the downmixing of a front-left channel<br>
Lf and a rear-left channel Lr into the channel L and during<br>
the downmixing of a front-right Rf and a rear-right channel<br>
Rr into the channel R. Therefore, the two combined ICC val-<br>
ues that are finally being combined into the single trans-<br>
mitted ICC parameter, both carry information about the<br>
front/back correlation of the original channels and a com-<br>
bination of these two ICC values will generally preserve<br>
most of this information. If one would have to further<br>
downmix the L and R channels into one single mono channel,<br>
one would get a third ICC value, carrying information about<br>
the left/right correlation of the downmix channels L and R.<br>
According to the cue combination of prior art, one would<br>
now have to combine the three ICC values applying a given<br>
function transforming the three ICC values into one<br>
transmitted ICC parameter.<br>
One has the problem then that front/back information mixes<br>
with left/right information, which is obviously disadvanta-<br>
geous for a reproduction of the original multi-channel au-<br>
dio signal. In the US-application 11/032,689, this is<br>
avoided by transmitting two downmix channels, the L and R<br>
channels, that hold the left/right information, and addi-<br>
tionally transmitting one single ICC value, holding<br>
front/back information. This preserves the spatial proper-<br>
ties of the original channels at the cost of a substan-<br>
tially increased data rate, resulting from the full addi-<br>
tional downmix channel to be transmitted.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide an im-<br>
proved concept to generate and to use a parametric repre-<br>
sentation of a multi-channel audio signal with compact side<br>
information in the context of a hierarchical coding scheme<br>
In accordance with the first aspect of the present inven-<br>
tion, this object is achieved by an encoder for generating<br><br>
a parametric representation of an audio signal having at<br>
least two original left channels on a left side and two<br>
original right channels on a right side with respect to a<br>
listening position, comprising: a generator for generating<br>
parametric information, the generator being operative to<br>
separately process several pairs of channels to derive a<br>
level information for processed channel pairs, and to de-<br>
rive coherence information for a channel pair including a<br>
first channel only having information from the left side<br>
and a second channel only having information from the right<br>
side, and a provider for providing the parametric represen-<br>
tation by selecting the level information for channel pairs<br>
and determining a left/right coherence measure using the<br>
coherence information.<br>
In accordance with a second aspect of the present inven-<br>
tion, this object is achieved by a decoder for processing a<br>
parametric representation of an original audio signal, the<br>
original audio signal having at least two original left<br>
channels on a left side and at least two original right<br>
channels on a right side with respect to a listening posi-<br>
tion, comprising: a receiver for providing the parametric<br>
representation of the audio signal, the receiver being op-<br>
erative to provide level information for channel pairs and<br>
to provide a left/right coherence measure for a channel<br>
pair including a left channel and a right channel, the<br>
left/right coherence measure representing a coherence in-<br>
formation between at least one channel pair including a<br>
first channel only having information from the left side<br>
and a second channel only having information from the right<br>
side; and a processor for supplying parametric information<br>
for channel pairs, the processor being operative to select<br>
level information from the parametric representation and to<br>
derive coherence information for at least one channel pair<br>
using the left/right coherence measure, the at least one<br>
channel pair including a first channel only having informa-<br>
tion from the left side and a second channel only having<br>
information from the right side.<br><br>
In accordance with a third aspect of the present invention,<br>
this object is achieved by a method for generating a para-<br>
metric representation of an audio signal.<br>
In accordance with a fourth aspect of the present inven-<br>
tion, this object is achieved by a computer program imple-<br>
menting the above method, when running on a computer.<br>
In accordance with a fifth aspect of the present invention,<br>
this object is achieved by a method for processing a para-<br>
metric representation of an original audio signal.<br>
In accordance with a sixth aspect of the present invention,<br>
this object is achieved by a computer program implementing<br>
the above method, when running on a computer.<br>
In accordance with a seventh aspect of the present inven-<br>
tion, this object is achieved by encoded audio data gene-<br>
rated by building a parametric representation of an audio<br>
signal having at least two original left channels on a left<br>
side and two original right channels on a right side with<br>
respect to a listening position, wherein the parametric<br>
representation comprises level differences for channel<br>
pairs and a left/right coherence measure derived from co-<br>
herence information from a channel pair including a first<br>
channel only having information from the left side and a<br>
second channel only having information from the right side.<br>
The present invention is based on the finding that a para-<br>
metric representation of a multi-channel audio signal sde-<br>
scribes the spatial properties of the audio signal well us-<br>
ing compact side information, when the coherence informa-<br>
tion, describing the coherence between a first and a second<br>
channel, is derived within a hierarchical encoding process<br>
only for channel pairs including a first channel having<br>
only information of a left side with respect to a listening<br>
position and including a second channel having only infor-<br><br>
mation from a right side with respect to a listening posi-<br>
tion. As in the hierarchical process the multiple audio<br>
channels of the original audio signal are downmixed itera-<br>
tively preferably into a monophonic channel, one has the<br>
chance to pick the relevant side-information parameters<br>
during the encoding process for a step involving only chan-<br>
nel pairs that bear the desired information needed to de-<br>
scribe the spatial properties of the original audio signal<br>
as good as possible. This allows to build a parametric rep-<br>
resentation of the original audio signal on the basis of<br>
those picked parameters or on a combination of those pa-<br>
rameters, allowing a significant reduction of the size of<br>
the side information, that is holding the spatial informa-<br>
tion of the downmix signal.<br>
The proposed concept allows combining cue values to reduce<br>
the side information rate of a downmix audio signal even<br>
for the case where only a single (monophonic) transmission<br>
channel is feasible. The inventive concept even allows<br>
different hierarchical topologies of the encoder. It is<br>
specifically clarified, how a suitable single ICC value can<br>
be derived, which can be applied in a spatial audio decoder<br>
using the hierarchical encoding/decoding approach to repro-<br>
duce the original sound image faithfully.<br>
One embodiment of the present invention implements a hier-<br>
archical encoding structure that combines the left front<br>
and the left rear audio channel of a 5.1 channel audio sig-<br>
nal into a left master channel and that simultaneously com-<br>
bines the right front and the right rear channel into a<br>
right master channel. Combining the left channels and the<br>
right channels separately, the important left/right coher-<br>
ence information is mainly preserved and is, according to<br>
the invention, derived in the second encoding step, in<br>
which the left master and the right master channels are<br>
downmixed into a stereo master channel. During this down-<br>
mixing process the ICC parameter for the whole system is<br>
derived, since this ICC parameter will be the ICC parameter<br><br>
resembling with most accuracy the left/right coherence.<br>
Within this embodiment of the present invention, one gets<br>
an ICC parameter, describing the most important left/right<br>
coherence of the six audio channels by simply arranging the<br>
hierarchical encoding steps in an appropriate way and not<br>
by applying some artificial function to a set of ICC pa-<br>
rameters, describing arbitrary pairs of channels, as it is<br>
the case in the prior art techniques.<br>
In a modification of the described embodiment of the pre-<br>
sent invention, the center channel and the low frequency<br>
channel of the 5.1 audio signal are downmixed into a center<br>
master channel, this channel holding mainly information<br>
about the center channel, since the low frequency channel<br>
contains only signals with such a low frequency that the<br>
origin of the signals can hardly be localized by humans. It<br>
can be advantageous to additionally steer the ICC value,<br>
derived as described above, by parameters describing the<br>
center master channel. This can be done, for example, by<br>
weighting the ICC value with energy information, the energy<br>
information telling how much energy is transmitted via the<br>
center master channel with respect to the stereo master<br>
channel.<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention, the hier-<br>
archical encoding process is performed such, that in a<br>
first step the left-front and right-front channels of a 5.1<br>
audio signal are downmixed into a front master channel,<br>
whereas the left-rear and the right-rear channels are down-<br>
mixed into a rear master channel. Therefore, in each of the<br>
downmixing processes an ICC value is generated, containing<br>
information about the important left/right coherence. The<br>
combined and transmitted ICC parameter is then derived from<br>
a combination of the two separate. ICC values, an advanta-<br>
geous way of deriving the transmitted ICC parameter is to<br>
build the weighted sum of the ICC values, using the level<br>
parameters of the channels as weights.<br><br>
In a modification of the invention, the center channel and<br>
the low frequency channel are downmixed into a center mas-<br>
ter channel and afterwards the center master channel and<br>
the front master channel are downmixed into a stereo master<br>
channel. In the latter downmixing process, a correlation<br>
between the center and the stereo channels is received,<br>
which is used to steer or modify a transmitted ICC parame-<br>
ter, thus also taking into account the center contribution<br>
to the front audio signal. A major advantage of the previ-<br>
ously described system is that one can build the coherence<br>
information such that channels, that contribute most to the<br>
audio signal, mainly define the transmitted ICC value. This<br>
will normally be the front channels, but for example in a<br>
multi-channel representation of a music concert, the signal<br>
of the applauding audience could be emphasized by mainly<br>
using the ICC value of the rear channels. It is a further<br>
advantage that the weighting between the front and the back<br>
channels can be varied dynamically, depending on the spa-<br>
tial properties of the multi-channel audio signal.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention an inventive hi-<br>
erarchical decoder is operative to receive less ICC parame-<br>
ters than required by the number of existing decoding<br>
steps. The decoder is operational to derive the ICC parame-<br>
ters required for each decoding step from the received ICC<br>
parameters.<br>
This might be done deriving the additional ICC parameters<br>
using a deriving rule that is based on the received ICC pa-<br>
rameters and the received ICLD values or by using prede-<br>
fined values instead.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, however, the decoder is opera-<br>
tional to use a single transmitted ICC parameter for each<br>
individual decoding step. This is advantageous as the most<br>
important correlation, the left/right correlation is pre-<br>
served in a transmitted ICC parameter within the inventive<br>
concept. As this is the case, a listener will experience a<br><br>
reproduction of the signal that is resembling the original<br>
signal very well. It is to be remembered that the ICC pa-<br>
rameter is defining the perceptual wideness of a recon-<br>
structed signal. If the decoder would modify a transmitted<br>
ICC parameter after transmission, the ICC parameters de-<br>
scribing the perceptual wideness of the reconstructed sig-<br>
nal may become rather different for the left/right and for<br>
the front/back correlation within the hierarchical repro-<br>
duction. This would be most disadvantageous since then, a<br>
listener that moves or rotates his head will experience a<br>
signal that becomes perceptually wider or narrower, which<br>
is of course most disturbing. This can be avoided by dis-<br>
tributing a single received ICC parameter to the decoding<br>
units of a hierarchical decoder.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, an inventive decoder is<br>
operational to receive a full set of ICC values or alterna-<br>
tively a single ICC value, wherein the decoder recognizes<br>
the decoding strategy to apply by receiving a strategy in-<br>
dication within the bitstream. Such the backwards compati-<br>
ble decoder is also operational in prior art environments,<br>
decoding prior art signals transmitting a full set of ICC<br>
data.<br>

Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments<br>
Fig. 1 shows a block diagram of an inventive encoder to<br>
generate a parametric representation of an audio signal.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a generator 220 to subsequently combine audio<br>
channels and generate spatial parameters describing spatial<br>
properties of pairs of channels that are combined into a<br>
single channel. Fig. 1 further shows a provider 222 to pro-<br>
vide a parametric representation of a multi-channel audio<br>
signal by selecting level difference information between<br>
channel pairs and by determining a left/right coherence<br>
measure using coherence information generated by the gen-<br>
erator 220.<br>
To demonstrate the principle of the inventive concept of<br>
hierarchical multi-channel audio coding, Fig. 1 shows a<br>
case, where four original audio channels 224a to 224d are<br>
iteratively combined, resulting in a single channel 226.<br>
The original audio channels 224a and 224b represent the<br>
left-front and the left-rear channel of an original four-<br>
channel audio signal, the channels 224c and 224d represent<br>
the right-front and the right-rear channel, respectively.<br>
Without loss of generality, only two of various spatial pa-<br>
rameters are shown in Fig. 1 (ICLD and ICC) . According to<br>
the invention, the generator 220 combines the audio chan-<br>
nels 224a to 224d in such a way that during the combination<br>
process an ICC parameter can be derived that carries the<br>
important left/right coherence information.<br>
In a first step, the channels containing only left side in-<br>
formation 224a and 224b are combined into a left master<br>
channel 228a (L) and the two channels containing only right<br>
side information 224c and 224d are combined into a right<br>
master channel 228b (R) . During this combination the gen-<br>
erator generates two ICLD parameters 230a and 230b, both<br>
being spatial parameters containing information about the<br>
level difference of two original channels being combined<br>
into one single channel. The generator also generates two<br><br>
ICC parameters 232a and 232b, describing the correlation<br>
between the two channels being combined into a single chan-<br>
nel. The ICLD and ICC parameters 230a, 230b, 232a, and 232b<br>
are transferred to the provider 222.<br>
In the next step of the hierarchical generation process,<br>
the left master channel 228a is combined with the right<br>
master channel 228b into the resulting audio channel 226,<br>
wherein the generator provides an ICLD parameter 234 and an<br>
ICC parameter 236, both of them being transmitted to the<br>
provider 222. It is important to note that the ICC parame-<br>
ter 236 generated in this combination step mainly repre-<br>
sents the important left/right coherence information of the<br>
original four-channel audio signal represented by the audio<br>
channels 224a to 224d.<br>
Therefore, the provider 222 builds a parametrical represen-<br>
tation 238 from the available spatial parameters 230a,b,<br>
232a,b, 234 and 236 such, that the parametrical representa-<br>
tion comprises the parameters 230a, 230b, 234, and 236.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a preferred embodiment of an inventive audio<br>
encoder that encodes a 5.1 multi-channel signal into a sin-<br>
gle monophonic signal.<br>
Fig. 2 shows three transformation units 240a to 240c, five<br>
2-to-1-downmixers 242a to 242e, a parameter combination<br>
unit 244 and an inverse transformation unit 246. The origi-<br>
nal 5.1 channel audio signal is given by the left-front<br>
channel 248a, the left-rear channel 248b, the right-front<br>
channel 248c, the right-rear channel 248d, the center chan-<br>
nel 248e, and the low-frequency channel 248f. It is impor-<br>
tant to note that the original channels are grouped in such<br>
a way that the channels containing only left side informa-<br>
tion 248a and 248b form one channel pair, the channels con-<br>
taining only right side information 248c and 248d form an-<br>
other channel pair and that the center channel 248e and<br>
248f are forming a third channel pair.<br><br>
The transformation units 240a to 240c convert the chan-<br>
nels 248a to 248f from the time domain into their spectral<br>
representation 250a to 250f in the frequency subband do-<br>
main. In the first hierarchical encoding step 252, the left<br>
channels 250a and 250b are encoded into a left master chan-<br>
nel 254a, the right channels 250c and 250d are encoded into<br>
a right master channel 254b and the center channel 250e and<br>
the low frequency channel 250f are encoded into a center<br>
master channel 256. During this first hierarchic encoding<br>
step 252, the three involved 2-to-1-encoders 242a to 242c<br>
generate the downmixed channels 254a, 254b, and 256, and in<br>
addition the important spatial parameter sets 260a, 260b,<br>
and 260c, wherein the parameter set 260a (parameter set 1)<br>
describes the spatial information between channels 250a and<br>
250b, the parameter set 260b (parameter set 2) describes<br>
the spatial relation between channels 250c and 250d and the<br>
parameter set 260c (parameter set 3) describes the spatial<br>
relation between channels 250e and 250f.<br>
In a second hierarchical step 262, the left master chan-<br>
nel 254a and the right master channel 254b are downmixed<br>
into a stereo master channel 264, generating a spatial pa-<br>
rameter set 266 (parameter set 4), wherein the ICC parame-<br>
ter, of this parameter set 266 contains the important<br>
left/right correlation information. To build a combined ICC<br>
value from parameter set 266, the parameter set 266 can be<br>
transferred to the parameter combination unit 244 via a<br>
data connection 2 68. In the third hierarchical encoding<br>
step 272, the stereo master channel 264 is combined with<br>
the center master channel 256 to form a monophonic result<br>
channel 274. The parameter set 276, that is derived during<br>
this downmixing process, can be transferred via a data con-<br>
nection 278 to the parameter combination unit 244. Finally,<br>
the result channel 274 is transformed into the time domain<br>
by the inverse transformation unit 246, to build the mono-<br>
phonic downmix audio signal 280, which is the final mono-<br><br>
phonic representation of the original 5.1 channel signal<br>
represented by the audio channels 248a to 248f.<br>
To reconstruct the original 5.1 channel audio signal from<br>
the monophonic downmix audio channel 280, the parametric<br>
representation of the 5.1 channel audio signal is addition-<br>
ally needed. For the tree structure shown in Fig. 2, it can<br>
be seen that the left front and back channels are combined<br>
into an L-signal 254a. Similarly, the right front and back<br>
channels are combined into an R-signal 254b. Subsequently,<br>
the combination of the L and R-signals is carried out,<br>
which delivers parameter set number 4 (266). In the case of<br>
this hierarchical structure, a simple way of deriving a<br>
combined ICC value is to pick the ICC value of parameter<br>
set number 4 and take this as combined ICC value, which is<br>
then incorporated into the parametric representation of the<br>
5.1 channel signal by the parameter combination unit 244.<br>
More sophisticated methods can also take into account the<br>
influence of the center channel (e.g. by using parameters<br>
from parameter set number 5), as shown in Fig. 2a.<br>
As an example, the energy ratio E(LR)/ E(C) of the energy<br>
contained in the LR (264) channel and in the C channel<br>
(256) from parameter set number 5 can be used to steer the<br>
ICC of value. In case most of the energy comes from the LR<br>
path, the transmitted ICC value should become close to the<br>
ICC value ICC(LR) of parameter set number 4. In case most<br>
of the energy comes from the C-path 256, the transmitted<br>
ICC value should become subsequently close to 1, as indi-<br>
cated in Fig. 2a. The Figure shows two possible ways to im-<br>
plement this steering of the ICC Parameter either by<br>
switching between two extreme values when the energy ratio<br>
crosses a given threshold 286 (steering function 288a) or<br>
by a smooth transition between the extreme values (steering<br>
function 288b).<br>
Figures 3a and 3b show a comparison of a possible paramet-<br>
ric representation of a 5.1 audio channel delivered from a<br><br>
hierarchical encoder structure using a prior art technique<br>
(Fig. 3a) and using the inventive concept for audio coding<br>
(Fig. 3b).<br>
Fig. 3a shows a parametric representation of a single time<br>
frame and a discrete frequency interval, as it would be<br>
provided by the prior art technique. Each of the 2-to-l en-<br>
coders 242a to 242e from Fig. 2 delivers one pair of ICLD<br>
and ICC parameters, the origin of the parameter pairs is<br>
indicated within Fig. 3a. Following the prior art approach,<br>
all parameter sets, as provided by the 2-to-l encoders 242a<br>
to 242e have to be transmitted together with the downmix<br>
monophonic audio signal 280 as side information to rebuild<br>
a 5.1 channel audio signal.<br>
Fig. 3b shows parameters derived following the inventive<br>
concept. Each of the 2-to-l encoders 242a to 242e contrib-<br>
utes only one parameter directly, the ICLD parameter. The<br>
single transmitted ICC parameter ICCC is derived by the pa-<br>
rameter combination unit 244, and not provided directly by<br>
the 2-to-l encoders 242a to 242e. As it is clearly seen in<br>
the figures 3a and 3b, the inventive concept for a hierar-<br>
chical encoder can reduce the amount of side information<br>
data significantly compared to prior art techniques.<br>
Fig. 4 shows another preferred embodiment of the current<br>
invention, allowing to encode a 5.1 channel audio signal<br>
into a monophonic audio signal in a hierarchical encoding<br>
process and to supply compact side information. As the<br>
principle hardware structure is equal to the one described<br>
in Fig. 2, the same items in the two figures are labeled<br>
with the same numbers. The difference is due to the differ-<br>
ent grouping of the input channels 248a to 248f and hence<br>
the order, in which the single channels are downmixed into<br>
the monophonic channel 274 differs from the downmixing or-<br>
der in Fig.2. Therefore, only the aspects differing from<br>
the description of Fig. 2, which are vital for the under-<br><br>
standing of the embodiment of the current invention shown<br>
in Fig. 4, are described in the following.<br>
The left-front channel 248a and the right-front chan-<br>
nel 248c are grouped together to form a channel pair, the<br>
center channel 248e and the low-frequency channel 248f form<br>
another input channel pair and the third input channel pair<br>
of the 5.1 audio signal is formed by the left-rear chan-<br>
nel 248b and the right-rear channel 248d.<br>
In a first hierarchical encoding step 252, the left-front<br>
channel 250a and the right-front channel 250c are downmixed<br>
into a front master channel 290 (F), the center chan-<br>
nel 250e and the low-frequency channel 250f are downmixed<br>
into a center master channel 292 (C) and the left-rear<br>
channel 250b and the right-rear channel 250d are downmixed<br>
into a rear master channel 294 (S) . A parameter set 300a<br>
(parameter set 1) describes the front master channel 290, a<br>
parameter set 300b (parameter set 2) describes the center<br>
master channel 292, and a parameter set 300c (parameter<br>
set 3) describes the rear master channel 294.<br>
It is important to note that the parameter set 300a as well<br>
as the parameter set 300c hold information that describes<br>
the important left/right correlation between the original<br>
channels 248a to 248f. Therefore, parameter set 300a and<br>
parameter set 300c is made available to the parameter com-<br>
bination unit 244 via data links 302a and 302b.<br>
In a second encoding step 262, the front master channel 290<br>
and the center master channel 292 are downmixed into a pure<br>
front channel 304, generating a parameter set 300d (parame-<br>
ter set 4). This parameter set 300d is also made available<br>
to the parameter combination unit 244 via a data link 306.<br>
In a third hierarchical encoding step 272, the pure front<br>
channel 304 is downmixed with the rear master channel 294<br>
into the result channel 274 (M), which is then transformed<br><br>
into the time domain by the inverse transformation unit 24 6<br>
to form the final monophonic downmix audio channel 280. The<br>
parameter set 300e (Parameter Set 5), originating from the<br>
downmixing of the pure front channel 304 and the rear mas-<br>
ter channel 294 is also made available to the parameter<br>
combination unit 244 via a data link 310.<br>
The tree structure in Fig. 4 first performs a combination<br>
of the left and right channels separately for front and<br>
rear. Thus, basic left/right correlation/coherence is pre-<br>
sent in the parameter sets 1 and 3 (300a, 300c) . A combined<br>
ICC value could be built by the parameter combination<br>
unit 244 by building the weighted average between the ICC<br>
values of parameter sets 1 and 3. This means that more<br>
weight will be given to stronger channel pairs (Lf/Rf ver-<br>
sus Lr/Rr). One can achieve the same by deriving a combined<br>
ICC   Parameter   ICCC   building   the   weighted   sum:<br>
ICCC = (A*ICC1 + B*ICC2)/(A+B)<br>
wherein A denotes the energy within the pair of channels<br>
corresponding to ICC1 and B denotes the energy within the<br>
pair of channels corresponding to ICC2.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, more sophisticated methods<br>
can also take into account the influence of the center<br>
channel (e.g. by taking into account parameters of the pa-<br>
rameter set number 4).<br>
Fig. 5 shows an inventive decoder, to process received com-<br>
pact side information, being a parametric representation of<br>
an original four-channel audio signal. Fig. 5 comprises a<br>
receiver 310 to provide a compact parametric representation<br>
of the four-channel audio signal and a processor 312 to<br>
process the. compact parametric representation such that a<br>
full parametric representation of the four-channel audio<br>
signal is supplied, which enables one to reconstruct the<br><br>
four-channel audio signal from a received monophonic audio<br>
signal.<br>
The receiver 310 receives the spatial parameters ICLD<br>
(B) 314, ICLD (F) 316, ICLD (R) 318 and ICC 320. The pro-<br>
vided parametric representation, consisting of the parame-<br>
ters 314 to 320, describes the spatial properties of the<br>
original audio channels 324a to 324d.<br>
As a first up-mixing step, the processor 312 supplies the<br>
spatial parameters describing a first channel pair 326a,<br>
being a combination of two channels 324a and 324b (Rf and<br>
Lf) and a second channel pair 326b, being a combination of<br>
two channels 324c and 324d (Rr and Lr). To do so, the level<br>
difference 314 of the channel pairs is required. Since both<br>
channel pairs 326a and 326b contain a left channel as well<br>
as a right channel, the difference between the channel<br>
pairs describes mainly a front/back correlation. Therefore,<br>
the received ICC parameter 320, carrying mainly information<br>
about the left/right coherence, is provided by the proces-<br>
sor 312 such that the left/right coherence information is<br>
preferably used to supply the individual ICC parameters for<br>
the channel pairs 326a and 326b.<br>
In the next step, the processor 312 supplies appropriate<br>
spatial parameters to be able to reconstruct the single au-<br>
dio channels 324a and 324b from channel 326a, and the chan-<br>
nels 324c and 324d from channel 326b. To do so, the proces-<br>
sor 312 supplies the level differences 316 and 318, and<br>
the processor 312 has to supply appropriate ICC values for<br>
the two channel pairs, since each of the channel pairs 326a<br>
and 326b contains important left/right coherence informa-<br>
tion.<br>
In one example, the processor 312 could simply provide the<br>
combined received ICC value 320 to up-mix channel<br>
pairs 326a and 326b. Alternatively, the received combined<br>
ICC value 320 could be weighted to derive individual ICC<br><br>
values for the two channel pairs, the weights being for ex-<br>
ample based on the level difference 314 of the two channel<br>
pairs.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
processor provides the received ICC parameter 320 for every<br>
single upmixing step to avoid the introduction of addi-<br>
tional artefacts during the reproduction of the channels<br>
324a to 324d.<br>
Fig. 6 shows a preferred embodiment of a decoder incorpo-<br>
rating a hierarchical decoding procedure according to the<br>
current invention, to decode a monophonic audio signal to a<br>
5.1 multi-channel audio signal, making use of a compact pa-<br>
rametric representation of an original 5.1 audio signal.<br>
Fig. 6 shows a transforming unit 350, a parameter-<br>
processing unit 352, five 1-to-2 decoders 354a to 354e and<br>
three inverse transforming units 356a to 356c.<br>
It should be noted that the embodiment of an inventive de-<br>
coder according to Fig. 6 is the counterpart of the encoder<br>
described in Fig. 2 and designed to receive a monophonic<br>
downmix audio channel 358, which shall finally be up-mixed<br>
into a 5.1 audio signal consisting of audio channels 360a<br>
(lf), 360b (1r), 360c (rf) , 360d (rr), 360e (co) and<br>
360f (lfe) . The downmix channel 358 (m) is received and<br>
transformed from the time domain to the frequency domain<br>
into its frequency representation 362 using the transform-<br>
ing unit 350. The parameter-processing unit 352 receives a<br>
combined and compact set of spatial parameters 364 in par-<br>
allel with the downmix channel 358.<br>
In a first step 363 of the hierarchical decoding process,<br>
the monophonic downmix channel 362 is up-mixed into a ste-<br>
reo master channel 364 (LR) and a center master channel 366<br>
(C) .<br><br>
In a second step 368 of the hierarchical decoding process,<br>
the stereo master channel 364 is up-mixed into a left mas-<br>
ter channel 370 (L) and a right master channel 372 (R).<br>
In a third step of the decoding process, the left master<br>
channel 370 is up-mixed into a left-front channel 374a and<br>
a left-rear channel 374b, the right master channel 372 is<br>
up-mixed into a right-front channel 374c and right-rear<br>
channel 374d, and the center master channel 366 is up-mixed<br>
to a center channel 374e and a low-frequency channel 374f.<br>
Finally, the six single audio channels 374a to 374f are<br>
transformed by the inverse transforming units 356a to 356c<br>
into their representation in the time domain and thus build<br>
the reconstructed 5.1 audio signal, having six audio chan-<br>
nels 360a to 360f. To retain the original spatial property<br>
of the 5.1 audio signal, the parameter processing unit 352,<br>
especially the way the parameter processing unit provides<br>
the individual parameter sets 380a to 380e, is vital, espe-<br>
cially the way the parameter processing unit 352 derives<br>
the individual parameter sets 380a to 380e.<br>
The received combined ICC parameter describes the important<br>
left/right coherence of the original six channel audio sig-<br>
nal. Therefore, the parameter processing unit 352 builds<br>
the ICC value of parameter set 4 (380d) such that it resem-<br>
bles the left/right correlation information of the origi-<br>
nally received spatial value, being transmitted within the<br>
parameter set 364. In the simplest possible implementation<br>
the parameter processing unit 352 simply uses the received<br>
combined ICC parameter.<br>
Another preferred embodiment of a decoder according to the<br>
current invention is shown in Fig. 7, the decoder in Fig. 7<br>
being the counterpart of the encoder from Fig. 4.<br>
As the encoder in Fig. 7 comprises the same functional<br>
blocks as the decoder in Fig. 6, the following discussion<br><br>
is limited to the steps in which the hierarchical decoding<br>
process differs from the one in Fig. 6. This is mainly due<br>
to the fact that the monophonic signal 362 is up-mixed in a<br>
different order and a different channel combination, since<br>
the original 5.1 audio signal had been downmixed differ-<br>
ently than the one received in Fig. 6.<br>
In the first step 363 of the hierarchical decoding process,<br>
the monophonic signal 362 is up-mixed into a rear master<br>
channel 400 (S) and a pure front channel 402 (CF).<br>
In a second step 368, the pure front channel 402 is up-<br>
mixed into a front master channel 404 and a center master<br>
channel 406.<br>
In a third decoding step 372, the front master channel is<br>
up-mixed into a left-front channel 374a and a right-front<br>
channel 374c, the center master channel 406 is up-mixed<br>
into a center channel 374e and a low-frequency channel 374f<br>
and the rear master channel 400 is up-mixed into a left-<br>
rear channel 374b and a right-rear channel 374d. Finally,<br>
the six audio channels 374a to 374f are transformed from<br>
the frequency domain into their time-domain representa-<br>
tions 360a to 360f, building the reconstructed 5.1 audio<br>
signal.<br>
To preserve the spatial properties of the original<br>
5.1 signal, having been coded as side information by the<br>
encoder, the parameter processing unit 352 supplies the pa-<br>
rameter sets 410a to 410e for the 1-to-2 decoders 354a to<br>
354e. As the important left/right correlation information<br>
is needed in the third up-mixing process 372 to build the<br>
Lf, Rf, Lr, and Rr channels, the parameter-processing<br>
unit 352 may supply an appropriate ICC value in the parame-<br>
ter sets 410a and 410c, in the simplest implementation sim-<br>
ply taking the transmitted ICC parameter to build the pa-<br>
rameter sets 410a and 410c. In a possible alternative, the<br>
received ICC parameter could be transformed into individual<br><br>
parameters for parameter sets 410a and 410c by applying a<br>
suitable weighting function to the received ICC parameter,<br>
their weight being for example dependent on the energy<br>
transmitted in the front master channel 404 and in the rear<br>
master channel 400. In an even more sophisticated implemen-<br>
tation, the parameter-processing unit 352 could also take<br>
into account center channel information to supply an indi-<br>
vidual ICC value for parameter set 5 and parameter set 4<br>
(410a, 410b).<br>
Fig. 8 is showing an inventive audio transmitter or re-<br>
corder 500 that is having an encoder 220, an input inter-<br>
face 502 and an output interface 504.<br>
An audio signal can be supplied at the input interface 502<br>
of the transmitter/recorder 500. The audio signal is en-<br>
coded using an inventive encoder 220 within the transmit-<br>
ter/recorder and the encoded representation is output at<br>
the output interface 504 of the transmitter/recorder 500.<br>
The encoded representation may then be transmitted or<br>
stored on a storage medium.<br>
Fig. 9 shows an inventive receiver or audio player 520,<br>
having an inventive decoder 312, a bit stream input 522,<br>
and an audio output 524.<br>
A bit stream can be input at the input 522 of the inventive<br>
receiver/audio player 520. The bit stream then is decoded<br>
using the decoder 312 and the decoded signal is output or<br>
played at the output 524 of the inventive receiver/audio<br>
player 520.<br>
Fig. 10 shows a transmission system comprising an inventive<br>
transmitter 500, and an inventive receiver 520.<br>
The audio signal input at the input interface 502 of the<br>
transmitter 500 is encoded and transferred from the out-<br>
put 504 of the transmitter 500 to the input 522 of the re-<br><br>
ceiver 520. The receiver decodes the audio signal and plays<br>
back or outputs the audio signal on its output 524.<br>
The discussed examples of inventive decoders downmix a<br>
multi-channel audio signal into a monophonic audio signal.<br>
It is of course alternatively possible to downmix a multi-<br>
channel signal into a stereophonic signal, which would for<br>
example mean for the embodiments discussed in Figs. 2 and<br>
4, that one step in the hierarchical encoding process could<br>
be by-passed. All other numbers of resulting channels are<br>
also possible.<br>
The proposed method to hierarchically encode or decode<br>
multi-channel audio information providing/using a compact<br>
parametric representation of the spatial properties of the<br>
audio signal is described mainly by shrinking the side in-<br>
formation by combining multiple ICC values into one single<br>
transmitted ICC value. It is to note here that the de-<br>
scribed invention is in no way limited to the use of just<br>
one combined ICC value. Instead, e.g., two combined values<br>
can be generated, one describing the important left/right<br>
correlation, the other one describing a front/back correla-<br>
tion.<br>
This can advantageously be implemented, for example, in the<br>
embodiment of the current invention shown in Fig. 2, where<br>
on the one hand a left front channel 250a and a left rear<br>
channel 250b is combined into a left master channel 254a,<br>
and where a right front channel 250c and a right rear chan-<br>
nel 250d is combined into a rear master channel 254b. These<br>
two encoding steps therefore yield information about the<br>
front back correlation of the original audio signal, which<br>
can easily be processed to provide an additional ICC value,<br>
holding front/back correlation information.<br>
Furthermore, in a preferred modification of the current in-<br>
vention, it is advantageous to have encoding/decoding proc-<br>
esses, which can do both, use the prior art individually<br><br>
transmitted parameters, and, depending on a signaling side<br>
information that is sent from encoder to decoder, also use<br>
combined transmitted parameters. Such a system can advanta-<br>
geously achieve both, higher representation accuracy (using<br>
individually transmitted parameters) and, alternatively, a<br>
low side information bit rate (using combined parameters).<br>
Typically, the choice of this setting is made by the user<br>
depending on the application requirements, such as the<br>
amount of side information that can be accommodated by the<br>
transmission system used. This allows to use the same uni-<br>
fied encoder/decoder architecture while being able to oper-<br>
ate within a wide range of side information bit<br>
rate/precision trade-offs. This is an important capability<br>
in order to cover a wide range of possible applications<br>
with differing requirements and transmission capacity.<br>
In another modification of such an advantageous embodiment,<br>
the choice of the operating mode could also be made auto-<br>
matically by the encoder, which analyses for example the<br>
deviation of the decoded values from the ideal result in<br>
case the combined transmission mode was used. If no sig-<br>
nificant deviation is found, then combined parameter trans-<br>
mission is employed. A decoder could even decide himself,<br>
based on an analysis of the provided side information,<br>
which mode is the appropriate one to use. For example, if<br>
there were just one spatial parameter provided, the decoder<br>
would automatically switch into the decoding mode using<br>
combined transmitted parameters.<br>
In another advantageous modification of the current inven-<br>
tion, the encoder/decoder switches automatically from the<br>
mode using combined transmitted parameters to the mode us-<br>
ing individually transmitted parameters, to ensure the best<br>
possible compromise between an audio reproduction quality<br>
and a desired low side information bit rate.<br><br>
As can be seen from the described preferred embodiments of<br>
the encoders/decoders in Figs. 2, 4, 6, and 7, these units<br>
make use of the same functional blocks. Therefore, another<br>
preferred embodiment builds an encoder and a decoder using<br>
the same hardware within one housing.<br>
In an alternative embodiment of the current invention it is<br>
possible to dynamically switch between the different encod-<br>
ing schemes by grouping different channels together as<br>
channel pairs, making it possible to dynamically use the<br>
encoding scheme that provides the best possible audio qual-<br>
ity for the given multi-channel audio signal.<br>
It is not necessary to transmit the monophonic downmix<br>
channel alongside the parametric representation of a multi-<br>
channel audio signal. It is also possible to transmit the<br>
parametric representation alone, to enable a listener, who<br>
already owns a monophonic downmix of the multi-channel au-<br>
dio signal, for example as a record, to reproduce a multi-<br>
channel signal using his existing multi-channel equipment<br>
and a parametric side information.<br>
To summarize, the present invention allows to determine<br>
these combined parameters advantageously from known prior<br>
art parameters. Applying the inventive concept of combining<br>
parameters in a hierarchical encoder/decoder structure, one<br>
can downmix a multi-channel audio signal into a mono-based<br>
parametric representation, obtaining a precise parametriza-<br>
tion of the original signal at a low side information rate<br>
(= bit-rate reduction).<br>
It is one objective of the present invention that the en-<br>
coder combines certain parameters with the objective of re-<br>
ducing the number of parameters that have to be transmit-<br>
ted. Then, the decoder derives the missing parameters from<br>
parameters that have been transmitted, instead of using de-<br>
fault parameter values, as it is the case in systems of<br>
prior art, for example the one being shown in Fig. 15.<br><br>
This advantage becomes evident reviewing again the embodi-<br>
ment of a hierarchical parametric multi-channel audio coder<br>
using prior art techniques, an example shown in Fig. 15.<br>
There, the input signals (Lf, Rf, Lr, Rr, C and LFE, corre-<br>
sponding to the left front, right front, left rear, right<br>
rear, center and low frequency enhancement channels, re-<br>
spectively) are segmented and transformed to the frequency<br>
domain to obtain the required time/frequency tiles. The re-<br>
sulting signals are subsequently combined in a pair-wise<br>
fashion. For example, the signals Lf and Lr are combined to<br>
form signal "L". A corresponding spatial parameter set (1)<br>
is generated to model the spatial properties between the<br>
signals Lf and Lr (i.e. consisting of one or more of IIDs,<br>
ICCs, IPDs). In the embodiment according to the prior art<br>
shown in Fig. 15, this process is repeated until a single<br>
output channel (M) is obtained, the output channel being<br>
accompanied by five parameter sets. The application of<br>
prior art hierarchical coding techniques would then imply<br>
the transmission of all parameter sets.<br>
It should be noted, however, that not all parameter sets<br>
have to contain values for all possible spatial parameters.<br>
For example, parameter set 1 in Fig. 15 may consist of IID<br>
and ICC parameters, while parameter set 3 may consist of<br>
IDD parameters only. If certain parameters are not trans-<br>
mitted for specific sets, the prior art hierarchical de-<br>
coder will apply a default value for these parameters (for<br>
example ICC = + 1, IPD = 0, etc.). Thus, each parameter set<br>
represents a specific signal combination only and does not<br>
describe spatial properties of the remaining channel pairs.<br>
This loss of knowledge about the spatial properties of sig-<br>
nals, who's parameters are not being transmitted, can be<br>
avoided using the inventive concept, in which the encoder<br>
is combining specific parameters such that the most impor-<br>
tant spatial properties of the original signal are pre-<br>
served.<br><br>
When, for example, ICC parameters are combined into a sin-<br>
gle value, the combined parameters can be used in the de-<br>
coder as a substitute for all individual parameters (or the<br>
individual parameter used in the decoder can be derived<br>
from the transmitted ones). It is an important feature that<br>
the encoder parameter combination process is carried out<br>
such that the sound image of the original multi-channel<br>
signal is preserved as closely as possible after recon-<br>
struction by the decoder. Transmitting ICC parameters, this<br>
means that the width (decorrelation) of the original sound<br>
field should be retained.<br>
It is to be noted here that the most important ICC value is<br>
between the left/right axis since the listener usually is<br>
facing forward in the listening set-up. This can be taken<br>
into account advantageously to build the hierarchical en-<br>
coding structure such that a suitable parametric represen-<br>
tation of the audio signal can be obtained during the it-<br>
erative encoding process, wherein the resulting combined<br>
ICC value represents mainly the left/right decorrelation.<br>
This will be explained in more detail later when discussing<br>
preferred embodiments of the current invention.<br>
The inventive encoding/decoding scheme allows to reduce the<br>
number of transmitted parameters from a encoder to a de-<br>
coder using a hierarchical structure of a spatial audio<br>
system by means of the two following measures:<br>
• combining the individual encoder parameters to form a<br>
combined parameter, which is transmitted to the de-<br>
coder instead of individual ones. The combination of<br>
the parameters is carried out such that the signal<br>
sound image (including L/R correlation/coherence) is<br>
preserved as far as possible.<br>
•   the transmitted combined parameter is used in the de-<br>
coder instead of several transmitted individual pa-<br><br>
rameters (or the actually used parameters are derived<br>
from the combined one).<br>
Depending on certain implementation requirements of the in-<br>
ventive methods, the inventive methods can be implemented<br>
in hardware or in software. The implementation can be per-<br>
formed using a digital storage medium, in particular a<br>
disk, DVD or a CD having electronically readable control<br>
signals stored thereon, which cooperate with a programmable<br>
computer system such that the inventive methods are per-<br>
formed. Generally, the present invention is, therefore, a<br>
computer program product with a program code stored on a<br>
machine readable carrier, the program code being operative<br>
for performing the inventive methods when the computer pro-<br>
gram product runs on a computer. In other words, the inven-<br>
tive methods are, therefore, a computer program having a<br>
program code for performing at least one of the inventive<br>
methods when the computer program runs on a computer.<br>
While the foregoing has been particularly shown and de-<br>
scribed with reference to particular embodiments thereof,<br>
it will be understood by those skilled in the art that<br>
various other changes in the form and details may be made<br>
without departing from the spirit and scope thereof. It is<br>
to be understood that various changes may be made in adapt-<br>
ing to different embodiments without departing from the<br>
broader concepts disclosed herein and comprehended by the<br>
claims that follow.<br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1. An encoder for generating a parametric representation (314,316,318,320) of<br>
an audio signal having at least two original left channels (224a,224b) on a left<br>
side and two original right channels (224c,224d) on a right side with respect to a<br>
listening position, comprising:<br>
a generator (220) for generating parametric information, the generator being<br>
operative to separately process several pairs of channels to derive a level<br>
information (230a,230b) for processed channel pairs, and to derive coherence<br>
information (232a,232b) for a channel pair including a first channel (228a) only<br>
having information from the left side and a second channel (228b) only having<br>
information from the right side; and<br>
a provider (222) for providing the parametric representation<br>
(238,314,316,318,320) by selecting the level information (230a,230b) for<br>
channel pairs and by determining a left/right coherence measure (236) using the<br>
coherence information (232a,232b) and to introduce the left/right coherence<br>

2.	The encoder as claimed in claim 1, wherein the generator (220) is operative<br>
