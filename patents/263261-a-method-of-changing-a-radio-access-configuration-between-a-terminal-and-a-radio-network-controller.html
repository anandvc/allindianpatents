Description<br>
CHANGING A RADIO ACCESS CONFIGURATION BETWEEN<br>
A TERMINAL AND A NETWORK<br>
Technical Field<br>
[1]	The present invention relates to wireless (radio) communications, and more par-<br>
ticularly, relates to changing a radio access configuration between a terminal and a<br>
network that support telecommunications.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2]	A universal mobile telecommunication system (UMTS) is a European-type, third<br>
generation IMT-2000 mobile communication system that has evolved from a European<br>
standard known as Global System for Mobile communications (GSM). UMTS is<br>
intended to provide an improved mobile communication service based upon a GSM<br>
core network and wideband code division multiple access (W-CDMA) wireless<br>
connection technology. In December 1998, a Third Generation Partnership Project<br>
(3GPP) was formed by the ETSI of Europe, the ARIB/TTC of Japan, the Tl of the<br>
United States, and the TTA of Korea. The 3GPP creates detailed specifications of<br>
UMTS technology. In order to achieve rapid and efficient technical development of the<br>
UMTS, five technical specification groups (TSG) have been created within the 3GPP<br>
for standardizing the UMTS by considering the independent nature of the network<br>
elements and their operations. Each TSG develops, approves, and manages the<br>
standard specification within a related region. Among these groups, the radio access<br>
network (RAN) group (TSG-RAN) develops the standards for the functions, re-<br>
quirements, and interface of the UMTS terrestrial radio access network (UTRAN),<br>
which is a new radio access network for supporting W-CDMA access technology in<br>
the UMTS.<br>

[20]	Figure 1 gives an overview of the UMTS network 100, including the UE 110, the<br>
UTRAN 120 and the core network (CN) 130. As shown in Figure 1, a UMTS system<br>
100 is generally composed of aUE 110, NodeB 122, RNC 124,126, SGSN 131, MSC<br>
132 and other nodes, with different interfaces therebetween, which will be explained in<br>
more detail.<br>
[21]	The UTRAN 120 is composed of several RNCs 124,126 and NodeBs 122, which<br>
are connected via the Iub interface. Each RNC controls several NodeBs. Each NodeB<br>
controls one or several cells, where a cell is characterised by the fact that it covers a<br>
given geographical area on a given frequency. Each RNC is connected via the Iu<br>
interface to the CN 130, i.e. towards the MSC 132 (Mobile-services Switching Centre)<br>
entity of the CN and the SGSN 131 (Serving GPRS Support Node) entity. RNCs can<br>
be connected to other RNCs via the Iur interface. The RNC handles the assignment and<br>
management of radio resources and operates as an access point with respect to the core<br>
network.<br>
[22]	The NodeBs receive information sent by the physical layer of the terminal (UE 110)<br>
through an uplink and transmit data to the terminal through a downlink. The Node-Bs<br>
operate as access points of the UTRAN for the terminal. The SGSN 131 is connected<br>
via the Gf interface to the EIR 133 (Equipment Identity Register), via the GS interface<br>
to the MSC 132, via the GN interface to the GGSN 135 (Gateway GPRS Support<br>
Node) and via the GR interface to the HSS 134 (Home Subscriber Server). The EIR<br>
hosts lists of mobiles (terminals) which are allowed or are not allowed to be used on<br>
the network. The MSC which controls the connection for CS services is connected via<br>
the NB interface towards the MGW 136 (Media Gateway), via the F interface towards<br>
the EIR 133, and via the D interface towards the HSS 134. The MGW 136 is connected<br>
via the C interface towards the HSS 134, and to the PSTN (Public Switched Telephone<br>
Network), and allows to adapt the codecs between the PSTN and the connected RAN.<br>
[23]	The GGSN is connected via the GC interface to the HSS, and via the GI interface to<br>
the Internet. The GGSN is responsible for routing, charging and separation of data<br>
flows into different RABs. The HSS handles the subscription data of the users.<br>
[24]	Other connections exist that are not important for the current invention.<br>
[25]	The UTRAN 120 constructs and maintains a radio access bearer (RAB) for com-<br>
munication between the terminal 110 and the core network 130. The core network<br><br>
3<br>
WO 2006/118426	PCT/KR2006/001672<br>
requests end-to-end quality of service (QoS) requirements from the RAB, and the RAB<br>
supports the QoS requirements the core network has set. Accordingly, by constructing<br>
and maintaining the RAB, the UTRAN can satisfy the end-to-end QoS requirements.<br>
[26]	The services provided to a specific terminal (UE 110) are roughly divided into the<br>
circuit switched (CS) services and the packet switched (PS) services. For example, a<br>
general voice conversation service is a circuit switched service, while a Web browsing<br>
service via an Internet connection is classified as a packet switched (PS) service.<br>
[27]	For supporting circuit switched services, the RNCs 124,126 are connected to the<br>
mobile switching center (MSC 132) of the core network 130 and the MSC 132 is<br>
connected to the gateway mobile switching center (GMSC) that manages the<br>
connection with other networks. For supporting packet switched services, the RNCs<br>
are connected to the serving general packet radio service (GPRS) support node (SGSN<br>
131) and the gateway GPRS support node (GGSN 135) of the core network. The<br>
SGSN supports the packet communications with the RNCs and the GGSN manages the<br>
connection with other packet switched networks, such as the Internet.<br>
[28]	Figure 2 illustrates a structure of a radio interface protocol between the terminal and<br>
the UTRAN according to the 3GPP radio access network standards. As shown in<br>
Figure 2, the radio interface protocol has horizontal layers comprising a physical layer,<br>
a data link layer, and a network layer, and has vertical planes comprising a user plane<br>
(U-plane) for transmitting user data and a control plane (C-plane) for transmitting<br>
control information. The user plane is a region that handles traffic information with the<br>
user, such as voice or Internet protocol (IP) packets. The control plane is a region that<br>
handles control information for an interface with a network, maintenance and<br>
management of a call, and the like.<br>
[29]	The protocol layers in Figure 2 can be divided into a first layer (LI), a second layer<br>
(L2), and a third layer (L3) based on the three lower layers of an open system inter-<br>
connection (OSI) standard model. The first layer (LI), namely, the physical layer,<br>
provides an information transfer service to an upper layer by using various radio<br>
transmission techniques. The physical layer is connected to an upper layer called a<br>
medium access control (MAC) layer, via a transport channel. The MAC layer and the<br>
physical layer exchange data via the transport channel. The second layer (L2) includes<br>
a MAC layer, a radio link control (RLC) layer, a broadcast/multicast control (BMC)<br>
layer, and a packet data convergence protocol (PDCP) layer. The MAC layer handles<br>
mapping between logical channels and transport channels and provides allocation of<br>
the MAC parameters for allocation and re-allocation of radio resources. The MAC<br>
layer is connected to an upper layer called the radio link control (RLC) layer, via a<br>
logical channel. Various logical channels are provided according to the type of in-<br>
formation transmitted. In general, a control channel is used to transmit information of<br><br>
4<br>
WO 2006/118426	PCT/KR2006/001672<br>
the control plane and a traffic channel is used to transmit information of the user plane.<br>
A logical channel may be a common channel or a dedicated channel depending on<br>
whether the logical channel is shared. Logical channels include a dedicated traffic<br>
channel (DTCH), a dedicated control channel (DCCH), a common traffic channel<br>
(CTCH), a common control channel (CCCH), a broadcast control channel (BCCH),<br>
and a paging control channel (PCCH), or a Shared Control Channel (SCCH) and other<br>
channels. The BCCH provides information including information utilized by a terminal<br>
to access a system. The PCCH is used by the UTRAN to access a terminal.<br>
[30]	For the purposes of MBMS additional traffic and control channels are introduced in<br>
the MBMS standard. The MCCH (MBMS point-to-multipoint Control Channel is used<br>
for transmission of MBMS control information, the MTCH (MBMS point-<br>
to-multipoint Traffic Channel) is used for transmitting MBMS service data. The<br>
MSCH (MBMS Scheduling Channel) is used to transmit scheduling information.<br>
[31]	Logical channels can be divided into Control Channels (CCH) and Traffic Channels<br>
(TCH). The Control Channels (CCH) may include a Broadcast Control Channel<br>
(BCCH); a Paging Control Channel (PCCH); a Dedicated Control Channel (DCCH); a<br>
Common Control Channel (CCCH); a Shared Control Channel (SHCCH); an MBMS<br>
point-to-multipoint Control Channel (MCCH); and an MBMS Scheduling Channel<br>
(MSCH). The Traffic Channels (TCH) may include a Dedicated Traffic Channel<br>
(DTCH); a Common Traffic Channel (CTCH); and an MBMS point-to-multipoint<br>
Traffic Channel (MTCH).<br>
[32]	The MAC layer is connected to the physical layer by transport channels and can be<br>
divided into a MAC-b sub-layer, a MAC-d sub-layer, a MAC-c/sh sub-layer, a MAC-<br>
hs sub-layer and a MAC-m sublayer according to the type of transport channel being<br>
managed. The MAC-b sub-layer manages a BCH (Broadcast Channel), which is a<br>
transport channel handling the broadcasting of system information. The MAC-c/sh<br>
sub-layer manages a common transport channel, such as a forward access channel<br>
(FACH) or a downlink shared channel (DSCH), which is shared by a plurality of<br>
terminals, or in the uplink the Radio Access Channel (RACH). The MAC-m sublayer<br>
may handle the MBMS data.<br>
[33]	The possible mapping between the logical channels and the transport channels from<br>
a UE perspective is given in Figure 3.<br>
[34]	The possible mapping between the logical channels and the transport channels from<br>
a UTRAN perspective is given in Figure 4.<br>
[35]	The MAC-d sub-layer manages a dedicated channel (DCH), which is a dedicated<br>
transport channel for a specific terminal. The MAC-d sublayer is located in a serving<br>
RNC (SRNC) that manages a corresponding terminal, and one MAC-d sublayer also<br>
exists in each terminal. The RLC layer, depending of the RLC mode of operation<br><br>
5<br>
WO 2006/118426	PCT/KR2006/001672<br>
supports reliable data transmissions and performs segmentation and concatenation on a<br>
plurality of RLC service data units (SDUs) delivered from an upper layer. When the<br>
RLC layer receives the RLC SDUs from the upper layer, the RLC layer adjusts the size<br>
of each RLC SDU in an appropriate manner based upon processing capacity and then<br>
creates data units by adding header information thereto. The data units, called protocol<br>
data units (PDUs), are transferred to the MAC layer via a logical channel. The RLC<br>
layer includes a RLC buffer for storing the RLC SDUs and/or the RLC PDUs.<br>
[36]	The BMC layer schedules a cell broadcast (CB) message transferred from the core<br>
network and broadcasts the CB message to terminals positioned in a specific cell or<br>
cells.<br>
[37]	The PDCP layer is located above the RLC layer. The PDCP layer is used to<br>
transmit network protocol data, such as the IPv4 or IPv6, efficiently on a radio<br>
interface with a relatively small bandwidth. For this purpose, the PDCP layer reduces<br>
unnecessary control information used in a wired network, a function called header<br>
compression.<br>
[38]	The radio resource control (RRC) layer located at the lowest portion of the third<br>
layer (L3) is only defined in the control plane. The RRC layer controls the transport<br>
channels and the physical channels in relation to setup, reconfiguration, and the release<br>
or cancellation of the radio bearers (RBs). The RB signifies a service provided by the<br>
second layer (L2) for data transmission between the terminal and the UTRAN. In<br>
general, the set up of the RB refers to the process of stipulating the characteristics of a<br>
protocol layer and a channel required for providing a specific data service, and setting<br>
the respective detailed parameters and operation methods. Additionally the RRC<br>
handles user mobility within the RAN, and additional services, e.g. location services.<br>
[39]	The different possibilities that exist for the mapping between the radio bearers and<br>
the transport channels for a given UE are not all possible all the time. The UE /<br>
UTRAN deduce the possible mapping depending on the UE state and the procedure<br>
that the UE / UTRAN is executing. The different states and modes are explained in<br>
more detail below, as far as they concern the present invention.<br>
[40]	The different transport channels are mapped onto different physical channels. The<br>
configuration of the physical channels is given by RRC signalling that is exchanged<br>
between the RNC and the UE.<br>
[41]	As for physical channels, the DPCH channel can be established and used simul-<br>
taneously between the UE and one or several cells of one or several NodeBs as shown<br>
in Figure 5.<br>
[42]	This situation where the UE has a DPCH established simultaneously to several cells<br>
is called soft handover. The case where the UE has established a DPCH simultaneously<br>
to several cells of the same NodeB is called softer handover. For the DPCH the UE is<br><br>
6<br>
WO 2006/118426	PCT/KR2006/001672<br>
always combining the TPC commands from all radio links in the downlink, and uses<br>
always the command, which asks for the least transmit power (i.e. in the case one radio<br>
link says Up and the other one Down the UE chooses to decrease the transmit power).<br>
[43]	The RLC layer (Radio Link Control) is a layer 2 protocol which is used in order to<br>
control the data exchange between the logical channels between the RNC and the UE.<br>
The RLC layer can currently be configured in 3 types of transfer modes: Transparent<br>
mode; Unacknowledged mode; and Acknowledged mode.<br>
[44]	The different functionalities that are available depend on the transfer mode.<br>
[45]	In acknowledged and unacknowledged mode SDUs (service data unit) can be split<br>
into smaller PDUs (protocol data units) that are used for transmission over the air<br>
interface. The transmitter side separates the SDU into PDUs, and based on control in-<br>
formation that is added to the PDUs the receiver side re-assembles the PDUs in order<br>
to reconstruct the SDUs. Such control information is e.g. a PDU sequence number in<br>
order to detect whether a PDU has been lost, or a Length Indicator (LI) which indicates<br>
the beginning / end of a SDU inside an RLC PDU.<br>
[46]	In unacknowledged mode, the receiver does not send a confirmation to the<br>
transmitter of correctly received PDUs, but the receiver side just reassembles PDUs to<br>
SDUs based on signalling information contained in the PDUs and transfers the<br>
complete SDUs to higher layers.<br>
[47]	In acknowledged mode, the receiver sends acknowledgements for the correctly<br>
received PDU. The transmitter uses these acknowledgements in order to initiate re-<br>
transmissions of missing PDUs. The acknowledgements are sent in certain conditions.<br>
There are several mechanisms foreseen in order to initiate the transmission of the ac-<br>
knowledgements for PDUs received by the receiver. Which mechanisms are activated<br>
is defined in the standard and/or configured by RRC signalling. One example for such<br>
a mechanism for the transmission of a status PDU is e.g. the reception of a PDU with a<br>
sequence number that does not correspond to the latest received sequence number<br>
increased by one, or when the receiver receives an indication from the transmitter in<br>
the RLC control information that an acknowledgment (also called Status) should be<br>
sent. The indication of the transmitter to send a status PDU is called Polling.<br>
[48]	When the transmitter sends a Polling bit, a mechanism is defined in the UMTS<br>
standard if no Status report has been received after the transmission of the polling after<br>
a certain time. This mechanism initiates the transmitter to retransmit a PDU including<br>
the polling indicator and is called a timer poll.<br>
[49]	Another mechanism counts the number of retransmissions of a PDU. In the case the<br>
retransmission exceeds a certain number (MaxDat) the transmitter starts the reset<br>
procedure, which is a procedure that allows setting of the transmitter and the receiver<br>
entity of a radio bearer using AM RLC mode to an initial state. When the Reset<br><br>
7<br>
WO 2006/118426	PCT/KR2006/001672<br>
procedure is initiated the initiating entity transmits a Reset PDU to the terminating<br>
entity. The terminating entity acknowledges the reception of the Reset PDU by<br>
transmitting the Reset Ack PDU. If the initiating entity has not received the Reset Ack<br>
PDU after a certain time the initiating entity retransmits the Reset PDU. If the<br>
initiating entity has not received an Reset Ack PDU after a certain amount of re-<br>
transmissions the initiating entity detects an unrecoverable error.<br>
[50]	This example describes the situation where a dysfunction is detected in the<br>
operation of an RLC entity in RLC AM mode. Other mechanisms to detect a<br>
dysfunction are possible, are already described in the UMTS standard, or possible to be<br>
imagined and implemented. It is also possible to imagine detection mechanisms for<br>
RLC entities in UM mode, which would e.g. detect that undefined signalling in-<br>
formation is included in the RLC PDU, or where higher layers detect that the reception<br>
/ transmission of the UM entity is not behaving correctly.<br>
[51]	As explained in the above there are mechanisms defined in the standard, and other<br>
mechanisms can be imagined that detect an unrecoverable error, which can correspond<br>
to a blocked situation, or a situation where the communication is disturbed.<br>
[52]	If the UE detects an unrecoverable error situation as described in the standard the<br>
UE enters CELLJFACH state and sends a Cell update message to the NodeB/RNC<br>
eventually indicating that an unrecoverable error has occurred by setting the IE<br>
(Information Element) Cell update cause to the cause RLC unrecoverable error. The<br>
UE indicates by including the IE AM_RLC error indication (RB2, RB3 or RB4) that<br>
this unrecoverable error has either occurred for one of the SRBs with the Ids 2, 3 or 4,<br>
or by including the IE AM_RLC error indication (RB&gt;4) that this error has occurred<br>
for one of the RBs using RLC AM mode with Ids higher than 4. The RNC can then<br>
send the Cell Update Confirm message and indicate that the RLC entities for SRBs<br>
with the Ids 2, 3 and 4, or for the RBs with Ids higher than 4 that use RLC AM mode<br>
shall be re-established by setting the IE RLC re-establish indicator (RB2, RB3 and<br>
RB4) and / or the RLC re-establish indicator (RB5 and upwards) to True.<br>
[53]	The UM / AM RLC entity is also responsible for handling of ciphering and de-<br>
ciphering. In order to do so the RLC entity in the transmitter and the receiver maintain<br>
a COUNT-C number, which is composed of a Hyper frame number (HFN) and the<br>
RLC sequence number. The COUNT-C value, together with other information is used<br>
as input to a mathematical function that generates a bitstring. This bitstring and the<br>
RLC PDU except the SN are combined by the logical XOR operation, which ensures<br>
the ciphering of the data part of the RLC PDU. The HFN value is incremented each<br>
time the RLC SN wraps around (i.e. when the RLC SN reaches its highest value and<br>
restarts from 0). In the case the receiver misses a certain number of SNs, or in the case<br>
the SN received has been altered during the reception it is possible that the COUNT-C<br><br>
8<br>
WO 2006/118426	PCT/KR2006/001672<br>
in the receiver and the transmitter are desynchronized. In this case the receiver is not<br>
capable to decipher correctly the information received. The receiver can detect the<br>
dysfunction of the deciphering entity by different mechanisms which are not further<br>
described here, and which are not part of the invention.<br>
[54]	Regarding the RRC states, the RRC mode refers to whether there exists a logical<br>
connection between the RRC of the terminal and the RRC of the UTRAN. If there is a<br>
connection, the terminal is said to be in RRC connected mode. If there is no connect<br>
ion, the terminal is said to be in idle mode. Because an RRC connection exists for<br>
terminals in RRC connected mode, the UTRAN can determine the existence of a<br>
particular terminal within the unit of cells, for example which cell or set of cells the<br>
RRC connected mode terminal is in, and which physical channel the UE is listening to.<br>
Thus, the terminal can be effectively controlled.<br>
[55]	In contrast, the UTRAN cannot determine the existence of a terminal in idle mode.<br>
The existence of idle mode terminals can only be determined by the core network to be<br>
within a region that is larger than a cell, for example a location or a routing area.<br>
Therefore, the existence of idle mode terminals is determined within large regions,<br>
and, in order to receive mobile communication services such as voice or data, the idle<br>
mode terminal must move or change into the RRC connected mode. The possible<br>
transitions between modes and states are shown in Figure 6.<br>
[56]	A UE in RRC connected mode can be in different states, e.g. CELL_FACH state,<br>
CELL_PCH state, CELL_DCH state or URA_PCH state. Other states could be<br>
envisaged of course. Depending on the states the UE carries out different actions and<br>
listens to different channels. For example a UE in CELL_DCH state will try to listen<br>
(amongst others) to DCH type of transport channels, which comprises DTCH and<br>
DCCH transport channels and which can be mapped to a certain DPCH, DPDSCH, or<br>
other physical channels. The UE in CELL_FACH state will listen to several FACH<br>
transport channel, which are mapped to a certain S-CCPCH, the UE in PCH state will<br>
listen to the PICH channel and to the PCH channel, which is mapped to a certain S-<br>
CCPCH physical channel.<br>
[57]	Regarding the reading of system information, the main system information is sent<br>
on the BCCH logical channel, which is mapped on the P-CCPCH (primary Common<br>
Control Physical Channel). Specific system information blocks can be sent on the<br>
FACH channel. When the system information is sent on FACH the UE receives the<br>
configuration of the FACH either on the BCCH that is received on P-CCPCH or on a<br>
dedicated channel. When system information is sent on the BCCH (i.e. via the P-<br>
CCPCH) then in each frame or set of two frames the SFN (System frame number) is<br>
sent which is used in order to share the same timing reference between the UE and the<br>
NodeB.<br><br>
9<br>
WO 2006/118426	PCT/KR2006/001672<br>
[58]	The P-CCPCH is always sent using the same scrambling code as the P-CPICH<br>
(primary common pilot channel), which is the primary scrambling code of the cell.<br>
Each channel uses a spreading code as commonly done in WCDMA (Wideband Code<br>
Division Multiple Access) systems. Each code is characterized by its spreading factor<br>
(SF), which corresponds to the length of the code. For a given spreading factor the<br>
number of orthogonal codes is equal to the length of the code. For each spreading<br>
factor the given set of orthogonal codes as specified in the UMTS system are<br>
numbered from 0 to SF-1.<br>
[59]	Each code can thus be identified by giving its length (i.e. spreading factor) and the<br>
number of the code. The spreading code that is used by the P-CCPCH is always of a<br>
fixed SF (spreading factor) 256 and the number is always the number 1. The UE knows<br>
about the primary scrambling code either by information sent from the network on<br>
system information of neighbouring cells that the UE has read, by messages that the<br>
UE has received on the DCCH channel, or by searching for the P-CPICH, which is<br>
always sent using the fixed SF 256, the spreading code number 0 and which always<br>
transmits a fixed pattern.<br>
[60]	The system information comprises information on neighbouring cells, configuration<br>
of the RACH and FACH transport channels, and the configuration of MICH and<br>
MCCH, which are channels that are dedicated channels for the MBMS service.<br>
[61]	Each time the UE is changing the cell it is camping (in idle mode) or when the UE<br>
has selected the cell (in CELL_FACH, CELL_PCH or URA_PCH) state the UE<br>
verifies that it has valid system information. The system information is organized in<br>
SIBs (system information blocks), a MIB (Master information block) and scheduling<br>
blocks. The MIB is sent very frequently and gives timing information of the scheduling<br>
blocks and the different SIBs. For SIBs that are linked to a value tag the MIB also<br>
contains information on the last version of a part of the SIBs. SIBs that are not linked<br>
to a value tag are linked to an expiration timer. SIBs linked to an expiration timer<br>
become invalid and need to be reread if the time of the last reading of the SIB is bigger<br>
than this timer value. SIBs linked to a value tag are only valid if they have the same<br>
value tag as the one broadcast in the MIB. Each block has an area scope of validity<br>
(Cell, PLMN, equivalent PLMN) which signifies on which cells the SIB is valid. A<br>
SIB with area scope Cell is valid only for the cell in which it has been read. A SIB with<br>
area scope PLMN is valid in the whole PLMN, a SIB with the area scope equivalent<br>
PLMN is valid in the whole PLMN and equivalent PLMN.<br>
[62]	In general, the UEs read system information when they are in idle mode,<br>
CELL_FACH state, CELL_PCH state or in URA_PCH state of the cells that they have<br>
selected / the cell that they are camping on. In the system information they receive in-<br>
formation on the neighbouring cells on the same frequency, different frequencies and<br><br>
10<br>
WO 2006/118426	PCT/KR2006/001672<br>
different RAT (Radio access technologies). This allows the UE to know which cells<br>
are candidates for cell reselection.<br>
[63]	Regarding the delays in communication, the conventional art call setup procedure<br>
takes a relatively long time due to the different message exchanges shown in Figure 7.<br>
Namely, Figure 7 shows the distribution of the delays in the call setup procedure. The<br>
delay that needs to be imputed to the network is the delay between the reception of the<br>
uplink message and the transmission of the downlink message. The graph shows the<br>
times between the reception / transmission of the messages in the RRC layer of the UE,<br>
i.e. does not include the time that it takes to send the uplink messages via the RLC.<br>
[64]	One part of the delay is due to the setup of the radio bearers. The delay between the<br>
transmission of the radio bearer setup and the radio bearer setup complete is mostly<br>
due to the activation time. The UE will only transmit the radio bearer setup complete<br>
message once the activation time has expired and the UE has synchronized on the new<br>
radio link.<br>
[65]	Figure 8 shows the synchronized radio bearer setup (reconfiguration) in more detail.<br>
In step 1, the procedure is initiated by the reception of a Rab assignment Request.<br>
Instead the procedure could be triggered by any other procedure. The steps 2 to 9 are<br>
related to the need to setup a new radio bearer, the allocation of the transport resources<br>
and the resources inside the NodeB. In step 10 the RNC decides on an activation time<br>
that is sent in the step 11 and 12 to the NodeB and the UE. The NodeB and the UE are<br>
then waiting for the activation time to be reached to switch to the new configuration in<br>
step 13a and 13b. In step 14 the UE confirms the successful reconfiguration to the<br>
RNC. The RNC indicates the successful completion of the reconfiguration.<br>
[66]	The gray shaded region, where basically the UE and the NodeB are just waiting for<br>
the expiry of the activation time corresponds to delay introduced, which is wasted in<br>
the case that the procedure is successful. This delay is necessary in the case that the<br>
message on the UE needs to be retransmitted by RLC. Also in the case the UE wants to<br>
send a failure message on the old RL some minimum delay is needed in order to allow<br>
this message to go through, and evtl. to cancel the reconfiguration in the NodeB by a<br>
separate message from the RNC. Therefore a means for decreasing this delay in the<br>
case everything works well (no RLC retransmission, no failure message) is necessary.<br>
[67]	Figure 9 shows the unsynchronized radio bearer setup (reconfiguration) in more<br>
detail. In the case of the unsynchronized reconfiguration, the RNC initiates syn-<br>
chronously in step 2 the reconfiguration towards the UE indicating that the recon-<br>
figuration shall be applied immediately, and in step 4 towards the NodeB, also<br>
indicating that the reconfiguration shall be applied immediately. Because there is no<br>
means to control the delay before the UE / NodeB will apply the configuration there is<br>
a high risk that the UE will not be able to achieve synchronization on the new RL, and<br><br>
11<br>
WO 2006/118426	PCT/KR2006/001672<br>
therefore will leave CELLJDCH state due to a physical channel failure.<br>
[68]	Figure 10 shows a hard handover procedure in more detail. Using a hard handover<br>
is already one possibility to avoid the activation time. In steps 1 to 10, the RNC<br>
establish on the NodeB a new independent configuration, with new transport resources<br>
for all transport channels. The NodeB tries to obtain synchronization to the UE by<br>
transmitting on the downlink with a fixed power that has been received form the RNC.<br>
In step 11, the UE receives the message to change the configuration used for the uplink<br>
and the downlink. In step 12, the UE tries to receive the downlink that is newly es-<br>
tablished and (optionally) starts to transmit in the uplink (depending whether the syn-<br>
chronization procedure A is used or not). The NodeB will detect that the syn-<br>
chronization of the old RL is lost, and that the synchronization with the new RL is<br>
gained, and report this to the RNC with the messages RL Link Failure for the old RL<br>
and RL Restore for the new Radio Links (step 13, 14). The RNC can then delete the<br>
old Radio Links (step 15, 16). The UE will indicate the successful Radio Bearer Setup<br>
Complete message (step 17), and the RNC can acknowledge the successful RAB setup<br>
to the CN (step 18).<br>
[69]	The problem with this scenario is that this implies that during the reconfiguration<br>
the resources for the old and the new configuration are used. This wastes capacity on<br>
the air interface (two sets of DL spreading codes are reserved) in the NodeB, where the<br>
NodeB needs to decode two different UE configurations and in the transport, and the<br>
RNC.<br>
[70]	Next, the aspects of uplink scrambling code, pilot pattern and synchronization will<br>
be considered.<br>
[71]	The current CDMA systems use scrambling codes, spreading codes and pilot<br>
patterns in order to allow synchronization and the exchange of data blocks from<br>
different transport channels, which are coded and multiplexed together. In the UMTS<br>
system in the uplink the UE transmits a pilot pattern, which is spread with a spreading<br>
code as defined in the standard, and scrambled with a fixed complex scrambling code.<br>
[72]	In the UMTS system the pilot pattern is sent on the DPCCH physical channel code<br>
and is time multiplexed with other DPCCH information e.g. the transmit power<br>
commands as shown in Figure 11 for the DPDCH / DPCCH frame structure in the<br>
uplink.<br>
[73]	The pilot pattern is sent at predefined time instants during each slot depending on<br>
the slot format chosen and is repeated at each frame. In the uplink, the PDCCH is sent<br>
always using the same spreading factor and spreading code. Therefore, the (time)<br>
instant where the pilot pattern is sent is always the same. In the case of compressed<br>
mode (i.e. when transmissions are interrupted e.g. in order to allow the UE to listen to<br>
a different frequency for doing measurements) the pattern (i.e. slot format) also<br><br>
12<br>
WO 2006/118426	PCT/KR2006/001672<br>
changes.<br>
[74]	Figure 12 shows an example of how the generation of a signal in the uplink is<br>
performed.<br>
[75]	The DPDCH on which the different transport channels are mapped is spread with a<br>
different spreading code (one or several spreading codes). The spreading factor used<br>
for the DPDCH can change dynamically from one TTI to the next one.<br>
[76]	Since the pilot patterns have a specific sequence this allows that the NodeB<br>
calculates the timing of the UE transmission by correlating the received sequence with<br>
the expected sequence, shifted by different times T as shown in Figure 13. This allows<br>
the NodeB to detect the timing of the uplink signal, and to verify whether the UE<br>
signal is contained in the received signal by comparing the absolute value of the sum<br>
of the complex value to a threshold. This is one way of doing, there are different ways,<br>
and the intention here is just to highlight that it is possible for the NodeB to check the<br>
timing of the uplink transmission, and to check whether the pilot sequence spread with<br>
a given spreading code and scrambled with a UE specific scrambling code is<br>
transmitted.<br>
[77]	Figure 13 shows an example of how detection of synchronization can be performed.<br>
[78]	Now referring to Figure 14, the concept of a Code Tree and Code Management will<br>
be considered. In the UMTS system the spreading codes of a length of 2" are used.<br>
These spreading codes can be generated out of a tree, which gives branches of<br>
orthogonal spreading codes. For each possible length of spreading codes there exists<br>
the number equal to the spreading factor of orthogonal codes. These codes are often<br>
grouped as a tree as shown in Figure 14. All codes of the same spreading factor are<br>
orthogonal. The codes of different spreading factors are orthogonal in the case that the<br>
code with higher spreading factor is not part of the branch of the code with lower<br>
spreading factor. In the figure when the code of length 4 with number 0 is used the<br>
codes 0 and 1 of the length 8 cannot be used any more because they are not orthogonal,<br>
but the codes 2 and 3 of the length 8 can be used. If the code 1 of the length 2 is used<br>
the codes below in this branch cannot be used any more in parallel.<br>
[79]	Next, the concepts of Downlink scrambling code, pilot pattern and synchronization<br>
will be considered.<br>
[80]	In the downlink the DPCCH is time multiplexed with DPDCH and spread with the<br>
same spreading codes. Therefore the instants where pilot patterns are sent can vary<br>
depending on the spreading factor, and depending on the fact whether compressed<br>
mode is used or not.<br>
[81]	Figure 15 shows an example of how the generation of a signal in the downlink is<br>
performed.<br>
[82]	Because the DPDCH is spread with the same spreading code as the pilot patterns<br><br>
13<br>
WO 2006/118426	PCT/KR2006/001672<br>
and the other physical layer information (i.e. the DPCCH) each time the spreading<br>
factor changes the pattern with which the pilot bits and the TPC bits are sent, and the<br>
pattern with which the other physical channel information is sent is different. This<br>
means that in the case the new configuration includes a spreading factor different from<br>
the spreading factor before the reception of the DPCCH is not possible any more if the<br>
UE tries to receive a different spreading factor. The format of the DPCCH can also be<br>
changed during the reconfiguration without the changing the spreading factor.<br>
[83]	The DPCH frame structure and its related DPCH timing characteristics will now be<br>
explained with reference to Figures 16 and 17.<br>
[84]	Figure 16 shows an example of the frame structure of the DPCH, and the structure<br>
of the DPCCH and the DPDCH that is transmitted.<br>
[85]	Figure 17 shows an example of DPCH timing. The DPCH, i.e. the timing of the<br>
DPDCH and DPCCH are offset compared to the Primary SCH. This means that the UE<br>
knows when the DPCCH is transmitted due to the parameter T      that it has received<br>
DPCH<br>
from the network beforehand.<br>
[86]	Regarding TFCIs, in the UTRAN system different transport channels are mapped<br>
together on a Coded Composite Transport Channel (CCTrCH), which is mapped on a<br>
DPDCH. Each transport channel can apply different Transport Formats (TFs), each<br>
transport format including a distinct set of parameters. When different Transport<br>
channels are multiplexed together on a CCTrCH the combination of the different TFs<br>
of each transport channel indicates a Transport Format Combination, which allows the<br>
receiver and the transmitter to determine how the coding of the different transport<br>
channels is done. Therefore in order to decode the DPDCH the UE needs to know the<br>
TFC. There are different possibilities in the UTRAN standard:<br>
[87]	In the case that the blind transport format detection is used the UE tries to decode<br>
the DPDCH with different TFC until the CRC code indicates that the information of all<br>
transport channels is received correctly. Alternatively the UTRAN can send the<br>
Transport Format Indicator, which is an indicator that signals the transport format<br>
combination of the different transport channels sent on the DPCCH.<br>
Disciosure of Invention<br>
Technical Solution<br>
[88]	One aspect of the present invention involves the recognition by the present<br>
inventors of the drawbacks in the related art. Namely, in the related art problem is that<br>
the procedures to setup, release or change the configuration of radio bearers are either<br>
supposed to be done in a synchronized manner, implying an activation time given by<br>
the RNC to the NodeB and the UE and therefore take a long tune, or imply the use of<br>
non-synchronized reconfigurations which means that the UE / NodeB might loose the<br><br>
14<br>
WO 2006/118426	PCT/KR2006/001672<br>
synchronization which implies that the call might be lost.<br>
[89]	Based upon such recognition, improvements to the setup, release or change in the<br>
configuration of radio bearers have been made according to the present invention.<br>
More specifically, the invention provides a method and system that allows syn-<br>
chronization of changes to configurations in a telecommunication system and has ap-<br>
plicability to various types of telecommunication technologies. Accordingly, the fast<br>
reconfiguration scheme of the present invention results in a decrease in call set up<br>
delays.<br>

Mode for the Invention<br>
[120]	The present invention is described as being implemented in a UMTS mobile com-<br>
munications system. However, the present invention may also be adapted and im-<br>
plemented in communications systems operating under other types of communication<br>
specifications, because the concepts and teachings of the present invention could be<br>
applied to various communication schemes that operate in a similar manner based upon<br>
common techniques. Non-limiting exemplary embodiments of the present invention<br>
are explained below with reference to the attached Figures.<br>
[121]	In one embodiment of the present invention, the RNC may indicate the new con-<br>
figuration including a changed uplink scrambling code to the NodeB and the UE, with<br>
a special indication to the UE that the new configuration should be applied as soon as<br>
possible, and to the NodeB that the new configuration shall be applied upon the<br>
detection of the new scrambling code in the uplink.<br>
[122]	In one optional part of the invention the RNC indicates to the UE together with the<br><br>
16<br>
WO 2006/118426	PCT/KR2006/001672<br>
new configuration an outage time during which the UE should continue the uplink<br>
transmission even when the downlink transmission stops. The NodeB tries to<br>
synchronize to receive the new uplink scrambling code, and upon detection of the new<br>
uplink scrambling code starts to transmit in the downlink using the new configuration.<br>
[123]         In another embodiment of the present invention, the NodeB may synchronously<br>
transmit the relevant control part of the downlink transmission of the old and the new<br>
configuration in order to maintain synchronization and inner loop power control with<br>
the UE before and after the change of the configuration. The NodeB might transmit the<br>
control part only during the frames where no data part is transmitted in the downlink.<br>
[124]	Upon detection of the new uplink scrambling code the NodeB applies the new con-<br>
figuration for the transmission in the downlink.<br>
[125]	In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the UE may indicate that it will<br>
apply the new configuration a predefined time interval before the change in the con-<br>
figuration either by: (1) Changing the uplink scrambling code; (2) Sending a specific<br>
signal to the NodeB, e.g. a bit pattern in the uplink, spread by a specific spreading code<br>
and scrambled with a specific scrambling code; (3) Using a specific set of TFCIs; (4)<br>
Sending a specific bit pattern in the FBI field; or (5) Any other signaling procedure.<br>
[126]         The RNC signals in a message to the NodeB and the UE which of the above<br>
schemes shall be applied for the change of the configuration, and indicates the relevant<br>
information, such as the special TFCI values to be used, the length of the period of<br>
outage upon change of the uplink spreading code during which the UE shall continue<br>
to transmit in the uplink, the time between the indication and the use of the new con-<br>
figuration in the uplink and / or downlink.<br>
[127]         In addition the NodeB could indicate to the RNC the minimum length of the period<br>
of outage upon change of the uplink spreading code during which the UE shall<br>
continue to transmit in the uplink, the time between the indication and the use of the<br>
new configuration in the uplink and / or downlink based on the NodeB performance.<br>
[128]	The present invention will be described in more detail as follows.<br>
[129]	Figure 18 shows an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, namely, a<br>
scheme for enhanced quasi-synchronized reconfiguration.<br>
[130]	In step 1, a new RAB is indicated to be setup by the CN. Alternatively this could<br>
also be used just to change a configuration in which the trigger is based on the RNC<br>
implementation, or in order to release a RAB.<br>
[131]	In steps 2 through 9, the RNC sends the new configuration to the NodeB in the Syn-<br>
chronized Radio Link Reconfigure Prepare message and the NodeB reserves the<br>
resources. The NodeB indicates that the configuration is accepted with the Syn-<br>
chronized Radio Link Reconfigure Ready message, and indicates the transport<br>
resources. (Legacy procedure).<br><br>
17<br>
WO 2006/118426	PCT/KR2006/001672<br>
[132]         In step 10, the RNC gives to the NodeB the indication that the new configuration<br>
shall only be applied when the UE changes the uplink scrambling code, or upon any<br>
other indication to the NodeB (New indication). This could also be indicated already in<br>
the Synchronized RL Reconfiguration Preparation message (new Indication that the<br>
change shall be done upon detection of the new scrambling code in the uplink), RL<br>
Setup (new Indication that this is linked to a UE context that already exists such that<br>
partly the same transport resources are used) or Unsynchronized RL Reconfiguration<br>
(new Indication that the reconfiguration should be done only after the synchronization<br>
is detected).<br>
[133]         In step 11, the NodeB would start to search for the uplink synchronization of the<br>
new uplink scrambling code whilst receiving the UE on the old scrambling code (New<br>
method). As one alternative the NodeB could already send the DPCCH of the new con-<br>
figuration during the DTX periods of the DPDCH of the old configuration as explained<br>
in (1) Simultaneous transmission of old and new configuration with different TDPCH<br>
described hereafter. The RNC may send the new configuration to the UE indicating<br>
that it should apply the configuration immediately. (Legacy procedure) Optionally,a<br>
new indication could be added such that the UE does not count as a RL failure when<br>
the DL is not received directly during a given time period. In order to be able to<br>
synchronize the transmission of the new configuration from the NodeB, it would be<br>
also possible to have an indication on the physical channel as explained in (2)<br>
Indication of the shift to the new configuration via the physical layer, described<br>
hereafter.<br>
[134]	In step 12, the UE changes to the new configuration, and amongst others applies the<br>
new TFCIs. In the case the slot format in the downlink does not change (i.e. the<br>
spreading factor is the same, and the slot format is not changed) the UE would not<br>
detect any outage because the NodeB would continue to use the same pattern for the<br>
transmission of the Pilot, TFCI and TPC pattern.<br>
[135]	In step 13, the NodeB would loose the uplink synchronization on the old scrambling<br>
code and detect that it receives the UE on the new scrambling code. In the gap between<br>
the detection by the NodeB of the old and the new scrambling code the NodeB would<br>
send power up signals as TPC commands.<br>
[136]         In step 14, the NodeB would immediately apply the new configuration in the uplink<br>
and the downlink, e.g. the new TFCI for the uplink and the downlink. In the case that<br>
the slot format changes in the downlink the UE would expect that the NodeB transmits<br>
with the new configuration. In this case, there are two possibilities:<br>
[137]	a) The NodeB transmits in parallel the new configuration. This however is only<br>
possible in the case that before and after the reconfiguration non overlapping spreading<br>
codes are used.<br><br>
18<br>
WO 2006/118426	PCT/KR2006/001672<br>
[138]         b) The NodeB switches to the new configuration upon detection of the change in<br>
the uplink scrambling code or any additional indication to the NodeB. This implies that<br>
the UE will not receive the NodeB during the time of the reconfiguration<br>
[139]	An alternative would be to indicate to the UE that when the new configuration is<br>
applied the UE should tolerate a certain outage. The length of this outage (number in<br>
slots / frames / seconds) would be given to the UE from the RNC in step 11.<br>
[140]	In step 15, the NodeB would indicate that the reconfiguration is successful to the<br>
RNC by sending a message, e.g. the Radio Link Restore message in order to indicate<br>
that the new format is used now and that the new downlink transport channels can be<br>
used, and that data can be received on the uplink transport channels. In step 16, the UE<br>
sends the Reconfiguration Complete message to the RNC. In step 17, the RAB is<br>
considered as established, and thus the RNC can indicate that the RAB is complete<br>
through the RAB assignment response message.<br>
[141]	(I) Simultaneous transmission of old and new configuration with different x<br>
	      T     r r DPCH<br>
[142]	In Figure 18, in steps 12 to 14, the NodeB stops the reception using the old con-<br>
figuration upon detection of the new scrambling code sent by the UE and then starts<br>
the transmission sending the new configuration. In practice the NodeB only needs to<br>
interrupt the transmission mostly in the case that the downlink scrambling code and /<br>
or the slot format / and or offset of the DPCH compared to the SCH are different. In<br>
order to allow the UE to obtain the synchronization immediately during recon-<br>
figuration even if the spreading factor / slot format / offset of the DPCH compared to<br>
the SCH are different, and to avoid the break in the reception during the time where the<br>
NodeB detects that the UE has changed the uplink scrambling code and until the<br>
NodeB starts the transmission of the new configuration in the downlink it is possible to<br>
transmit simultaneously the old configuration and the new configuration as shown<br>
Figure 19.<br>
[143]         In Figure 19, it is shown how via the shift of the DPCH of the new configuration<br>
with respect to the old configuration it is possible to transmit the DPCCH of the old<br>
configuration and the new configuration simultaneously. However this supposes that<br>
the DPDCH is at least partly not transmitted. Alternatively not the complete DPCCH<br>
of the new / old configuration is transmitted but only the most important information,<br>
i.e. the TPC bits, or the pilot bits, or the feedback bits.<br>
[144]         Figure 20 highlights an alternative to the steps 10-16 of Figure 18. In Figure 20,<br>
upon reception of the indication to check for the reception of the new uplink<br>
scrambling code in the Radio Link Reconfiguration Commit including the indication<br>
that the start of the new configuration depends on the change in the uplink scrambling<br>
code the NodeB starts to transmit the new configuration during periods where the<br>
DPDCH is not transmitted in the downlink. This is only possible in the case that the r<br><br>
19<br>
WO 2006/118426	PCT/KR2006/001672<br>
for the new configuration compared to the old configuration is such that the<br>
DPCCH of the new configuration falls into periods where nothing is transmitted. This<br>
allows that the used spreading codes before and after the reconfiguration do not need to<br>
be orthogonal any more, i.e. they can be chosen in the same branch.<br>
[145]	(2) Indication of the shift to the new configuration via the physical layer<br>
[146]         In order to give the NodeB the possibility to be warned before the new con-<br>
figuration is sent it would be possible that the UE sends an indication to the NodeB,<br>
which would be sent at or before the reconfiguration. Several realizations of such a<br>
scheme would be possible. One method could be that the UE indicates this by sending<br>
a certain bit pattern on a special spreading code in parallel to the transmission of the<br>
DPCCH/DPDCH as shown in Figure 21.<br>
[147]	There a specific pattern is sent which is mapped on an additional specific spreading<br>
code. The UE and the NodeB would be informed that the specific pattern and<br>
spreading code are used in order to indicate when the reconfiguration takes place.<br>
[148]         Another alternative would be that the UE changes the uplink scrambling code only,<br>
without starting to try to receive immediately using the new downlink configuration,<br>
such that the NodeB is aware of the imminent change of the downlink configuration.<br>
[149]         Another alternative would be to indicate that the reconfiguration will happen<br>
quickly by using alternative TFCIs at or before the reconfiguration, i.e. as shown in<br>
Figure 22, the UE would only use the TFCI6 before or during the reconfiguration<br>
instead of the TFCI 0, TFCI 7 instead of TFCI 1 etc. This implies that the TFCI would<br>
not only indicate the transport format combination such as today, but in addition also<br>
the switching to the new configuration. How the TFCI includes the information of the<br>
switching information would then be configured by the RNC to the NodeB and the UE.<br>
Also at which time (e.g. x frames / slots / seconds before the new configuration is<br>
applied) the alternative TFCI or other indication is applied would be indicated by the<br>
RNC to the NodeB and the UE, which would use this information to synchronize the<br>
reconfiguration.<br>
[150]         Another alternative would be to allocate the FBI bits as indicated in Figure 11 in<br>
order to indicate the change of the reconfiguration by the UE.<br>
[151]         In the different methods as shown above the timing of the uplink indication would<br>
be such that the NodeB has sufficiently time to prepare itself to switch to the new con-<br>
figuration. This scheme is shown in Figure 23.<br>
[152]	Because different NodeBs could have different processing times it could be possible<br>
that the NodeB indicates the time difference between the transmission of the indication<br>
from the UE to the switching to the new configuration to the RNC in step 10, the RNC •<br>
confirms the time that will be used to the NodeB based on the times received from all<br>
NodeB s in the active set of the UE to the NodeB in step 11, and indicates the uplink<br><br>
20<br>
WO 2006/118426	PCT/KR2006/001672<br>
activation time that the UE should use in step 12. The UE will start then the recon-<br>
figuration by transmitting the indication to the NodeB in step 13. The NodeB would<br>
upon reception start a timer to synchronize the start of the new configuration with the<br>
UE. In step 15a and 15b the UE and the NodeB would start the reconfiguration at the<br>
same time. The NodeB and the UE would then confirm the successful reconfiguration<br>
in step 16 and 17.<br>
[153]	As described above, the present invention provides a method to trigger the use of a<br>
new configuration. Such triggers may be comprised of (1) the transmission of the new<br>
configuration from the RNC to a UE and a NodeB (2); the configuration of a specific<br>
indication in the UE and NodeB to trigger the use of the new configuration; and (3) the<br>
indication of the UE to the NodeB that the new configuration is applied where the<br>
indication can be any of: FBI bits, uplink scrambling code (to allow backward com-<br>
patibility), a special bit pattern, a set of TFCIs, or the like. Here, the indication can be<br>
sent x seconds before the new configuration is applied where: X is indicated by the<br>
RNC to the NodeB and the UE and X might be indicated from the NodeB to the RNC<br>
previously depending on the capabilities of the NodeB. The UE may continue the<br>
uplink transmission after the application of the new configuration during Y seconds<br>
even if the new configuration is not received in the downlink where: Y is indicated by<br>
the RNC to the UE and Y might be indicated from the NodeB to the RNC previously<br>
depending on the capabilities of the NodeB. A NodeB may transmit two control parts<br>
that may be spread using non-orthogonal spreading codes that are scrambled with the<br>
same scrambling codes, and where the transmission is time multiplexed. An RNC may<br>
choose the timing offsets of two configurations such that the control part of the two<br>
configurations can be sent time multiplexed without overlapping, and spread by the<br>
non-orthogonal spreading codes of the two configurations.<br>
[154]	Accordingly, the present invention speeds up RB setup / release or reconfiguration<br>
procedures, and reduces therefore the call setup delay and optimizes the usage of<br>
channel resources. The impacts of the invention are relatively small and easily feasible<br>
in the software of the RNC / NodeB / UE.<br>
[155]         To implement the various features described above, the present invention can<br>
employ various types of hardware and/or software components (modules). For<br>
example, different hardware modules may contain various circuits and components<br>
necessary to perform the steps of the above method. Also, different software modules<br>
(executed by processors and/or other hardware) may contain various codes and<br>
protocols necessary to perform the steps of the present invention method.<br>
[156]         Figure 24 shows an exemplary method of changing a radio access configuration<br>
between a terminal (UE) and a network (Node B) according to the present invention.<br>
[157]         Namely, the present invention provides a method of changing a radio access con-<br><br>
21<br>
WO 2006/118426	PCT/KR2006/001672<br>
figuration between a terminal and a network, the method (e.g., performed by the Node<br>
B) comprising: initiating, by the network, a second configuration that is related to a<br>
first configuration for the same terminal; informing the terminal to apply the second<br>
configuration; and determining when the terminal uses the second configuration based<br>
on the reception of a radio signal from the terminal.<br>
[158]	The determining may comprise: detecting that the terminal will apply or has applied<br>
the second configuration. The determining may comprise: comparing a power of a first<br>
radio resource and a power of a second radio resource. The radio signal from the<br>
terminal may correspond to a control channel. The control channel may comprise pilot<br>
bits modulated by a scrambling code that is different from a scrambling code used for<br>
the first configuration. The radio signal is considered to be received when a power of a<br>
second uplink scrambling code is higher than a power of a first uplink scrambling<br>
code. The second uplink scrambling code may be given by the network together with<br>
the second configuration. The control channel may comprise at least one of FBI bits,<br>
uplink scrambling code, special bit pattern, and a set of TFCI. The initiating step may<br>
comprise: receiving information about the second configuration from a radio network<br>
controller; and reserving necessary transport resources for the second configuration.<br>
The method may further comprise: releasing the old configuration after the de-<br>
termining step. The method may further comprise: transmitting, to the terminal, an<br>
indication to use the second configuration without interrupting uplink transmission.<br>
The signaling using at least parts of the first configuration and at least parts of the<br>
second configuration may be performed in parallel. The method may further comprise:<br>
prior to the initiating step, determining whether a Node B of the network is able to<br>
support the first and second configurations.<br>
[159]	Also, the present invention provides a method of changing a radio access con-<br>
figuration between a terminal and a network, the method (e.g., performed by the UE)<br>
comprising: receiving information to apply a second configuration; transmitting, to the<br>
network, a radio signal indicating a change in configuration; and changing from a first<br>
configuration to the second configuration at a predetermined time after transmitting the<br>
radio signal.<br>
[160]	The radio signal indicating the change in configuration may be comprised in the<br>
second configuration given by the network. The method may further comprise: con-<br>
tinuously transmitting after applying the second configuration for a certain duration<br>
despite no reception using the second configuration. The method may further<br>
comprise: receiving, from the network, an indication to use the second configuration<br>
without interrupting uplink transmission.<br>
[161]	Figure 25 shows a procedure of synchronized reconfiguration using activation time<br>
set as depicted by steps 1) through 4). In currently used networks, the delay introduced<br><br>
22<br>
WO 2006/118426	PCT/KR2006/001672<br>
due to the radio bearer setup is a significant part of the delay for the setup or recon-<br>
figuration of calls. This delay is mostly imputed to the current procedure of syn-<br>
chronization with activation time, since the UE and NodeB will only apply a new con-<br>
figuration once the activation time has expired. The shaded part indicates the delay<br>
where basically the UE and the NodeB are just waiting for the expiry of the activation<br>
time. This delay is necessary either in the case when the UE is in a bad radio condition<br>
requiring retransmission of the reconfiguration message, or in case of UE failure<br>
message requiring some minimum delay. However, in a case where everything works<br>
well (no retransmission, no failure message) the same delay is applied which is wasted.<br>
Therefore, enhancements for decreasing this delay are necessary and the syn-<br>
chronization by using a new uplink scrambling code is one proposed way.<br>
[162]	Figure 26 shows a procedure of synchronized reconfiguration upon the detection of<br>
the uplink scrambling code, according to the present invention, as depicted in steps 1)<br>
through 8).<br>
[163]         In a first step, the resources for the reconfigured radio link are allocated including<br>
the change in the uplink scrambling code. It can be noted that beforehand, checking<br>
was done on availability of resources, also as UE radio conditions (e.g. current SIR<br>
value). Depending of these conditions, RNC and NodeB can decide to apply either<br>
current specified synchronization method by waiting of expiry of activation time or<br>
synchronization by proposed method.<br>
[164]	When RL reconfiguration commit including the indication to check for new UL<br>
scrambling code for synchronization, the NodeB would then start to check whether the<br>
UE uses the new scrambling code. The RNC transmits the new configuration to the UE<br>
with activation time NOW. When received, the UE would then immediately apply the<br>
new configuration. Upon detection of the new uplink scrambling code, the NodeB<br>
would then stop to transmit the old configuration, apply the new configuration and<br>
consider that the reconfiguration is successful.<br>
[165]	Figure 27 shows the processing at physical layer. The physical layer processing is<br>
started after setting up LI in NodeB including the start of checking for new UL<br>
scrambling code for synchronization.<br>
[166]	When the NodeB receives the reconfiguration message, it continues transmitting<br>
and receiving the old configuration and checks constantly whether the UE uses the new<br>
or the old scrambling code. As the NodeB is aware of the fact that the UE currently<br>
transmitting on a RL will be reconfigured, it knows exactly the channel and the paths<br>
of the UL transmission channel. Thus, it can perform detection whether UE uses new<br>
configuration or the old configuration, for instance by descrambling with the old and<br>
the new scrambling code then checks to see which one receives most of the power.<br>
[167]	The delay to trigger the new configuration at the UE can be assumed very short<br><br>
23<br>
WO 2006/118426	PCT/KR2006/001672<br>
since the UE is supposed to be in relatively good radio conditions requiring none or<br>
few message retransmission. The new configuration would include on top of a new<br>
uplink scrambling code to be used, the order to the UE do not use the synchronization<br>
procedure A (e.g. by not including the IE Frequency Info). When the UE receives the<br>
reconfiguration message it will apply the new configuration in the beginning of the<br>
next frame. As soon as the UE uses the new configuration it assumes that the DL also<br>
uses the new configuration with new scrambling code.<br>
[168]	However, the NodeB still continues with the old configuration until having detected<br>
the new scrambling code. Thus there may be a risk that UE would detect the loss of<br>
synchronization which could lead to a radio link failure in a case where the NodeB<br>
takes too long time to detect the new scrambling code. Then the time limit for NodeB<br>
to detect the change in scrambling code is given by radio link failure period which is<br>
about 3 sec as explained below.<br>
[169]	The UE continues the transmission until a radio link failure would be detected. The<br>
radio link failure is based on the out-of-sync handling, where the physical layers only<br>
report out-of-sync after 160 msec of bad reception. So the first out-of-sync will be sent<br>
to upper layers after 160 msec. Further out-of-sync can be transmitted to upper layers<br>
every 10 msec. There must be N313 out of sync reported to higher layer to start T313.<br>
At expiry of T313 the UE will consider this as a radio link failure and the UE will quit<br>
transmission, i.e. after 160 msec + N313 * 10 msec + T313. The default values for<br>
N3I3 and T313 may be 20 and 3 sec respectively, which would give a delay of<br>
3360msecs before stopping the uplink transmission.<br>
[170]         Therefore as the Node B knows that the new scrambling code and the previous<br>
scrambling code are transmitted from the same UE the accurate timing information is<br>
available in the NodeB. Then the probability to detect the new scrambling code before<br>
the 3 sec of RL failure is higher.<br>
[171]	The delay for detection would depend of many parameters as the SIR target that is<br>
necessary for the NodeB is implementation specific, also the offset between DPCCH<br>
and DPDCH, and the beta values are implementation specific, and outer loop probably<br>
impacts the transmission from the UE which is not standardized neither.<br>
[172]	In order to detect the change in the scrambling code the threshold needs to be fixed.<br>
It is related to different radio conditions (pedestrian, vehicular etc.) and different<br>
ULSIRDPCCH targets for the uplink. The target threshold can be defined as the ratio<br>
SIRnew/SIRold. Where SIRnew is the measured SIRDPCCH with a new scrambling<br>
code, and SIRold is the measured SIRDPCCH with the current (initial) scrambling<br>
code. During checking period, as shown in Figure 27, the target threshold is compared<br>
to the current measured SIRnew/SIRold; when it exceed the target threshold NodeB<br>
considers the change in uplink scrambling code then apply new configuration<br><br>
24<br>
WO 2006/118426	PCT/KR2006/001672<br>
parameters.<br>
[173]         In order to define the target threshold, simulation is performed to define for each<br>
ULSIRDPCCH targets two CDFs of the maximum ratio of SIKnew/SIRold one cor-<br>
responding to the ratio before the UE has applied the new configuration and another<br>
one to the ratio after the UE has applied the new configuration. Based on these CDFs<br>
the threshold can be defined for different UL SIR DPCCH values that the NodeB<br>
should use such that the false detection probability is limited to a certain value. Then<br>
CDFs of SIRnew/SIRold for each slots (or N averaged slots) after the UE has applied a<br>
new configuration will allow to check after how many slots the NodeB would have<br>
detected the new scrambling code with a given probability.<br>
[174]	One characteristic of the present invention is to combine the advantages of the syn-<br>
chronized reconfiguration procedure in terms of efficiency and resource usage with the<br>
speed of the unsynchronized hard handover procedure in order to decrease the delay<br>
for a reconfiguration procedure that is typically used e.g. for the video / voice call<br>
setup or the reconfiguration of radio links.<br>
[175]         Figure 28 shows an exemplary scheme for using Synchronization by Activation<br>
Time NOW and new scrambling code according to the present invention, as depicted<br>
in steps 1) through 10).<br>
[176]	In step 1, the resources for the reconfiguration of this radio link are allocated<br>
including the change in the uplink scrambling code. It can be noted that the allocation<br>
of resources can include the availability of resources, whether the NodeB or the DRNC<br>
support the procedures as well as a check of the radio conditions (e.g. current SIR<br>
value). Depending on these conditions, the network (e.g., RNC and NodeB) can decide<br>
to apply either the current specified synchronization method by waiting of expiry of<br>
the activation time or apply a new synchronization method.<br>
[177]	When RL reconfiguration is triggered as shown in step 2 using the Radio Link Re-<br>
configuration Commit message including the indication to check for the new UL<br>
scrambling code for synchronization (i.e., Fast Reconfiguration IE) in the case that it<br>
has been confirmed previously in step 1 that this procedure can be applied, the NodeB<br>
would then start to check whether the UE uses the new scrambling code. It may be up<br>
to the NodeB implementation to ensure that the reconfiguration is reliable. This can be<br>
done by the NodeB by transmitting at least the downlink DPCCH of the new con-<br>
figuration such that the UL power control is maintained. The power of the transmission<br>
of the downlink DPCCH using the new configuration can be linked to the power for<br>
the transmission of the old DPCCH. Until the NodeB has detected that the UE uses the<br>
new configuration in the uplink the NodeB should send UP commands. The CFN value<br>
that is still contained in the Radio Link Reconfiguration Commit is used in order to<br>
indicate the earliest possible CFN at which the reconfiguration might be applied by the<br><br>
25<br>
WO 2006/118426	PCT/KR2006/001672<br>
UE. Therefore the reliability of this procedure should be at least similar to the re-<br>
liability of the hard handover procedure or higher, because during the procedure the<br>
timing of the RLs are not changed.<br>
[178]	If necessary, the RNC can increase the SIR target for the outer loop power control<br>
during the reconfiguration phase via the OUTER LOOP PC control frame.<br>
[179]	The RNC transmits the new configuration to the UE with activation time NOW as<br>
shown in step 4 in a RB control message. When received the UE then immediately<br>
applies the new configuration as shown in step 5. Upon detection of the new uplink<br>
scrambling code the NodeB then stops to transmit the old configuration, applies the<br>
new configuration and considers that the reconfiguration is successful.<br>
[180]	In order to indicate to the RNC that the new configuration is applied in the uplink<br>
and the downlink the Radio Link Restore Indication is sent to the RNC such that the<br>
RNC can start to use the new configuration as shown in step 9. In step 10 the UE<br>
indicates the completion of the reconfiguration to the RNC.<br>
[181]         In Figure 29, the details of the behaviour for the case where the NodeB is on the Iur<br>
interface are shown.<br>
[182]	In step 1 the SRNC indicates to the DRNC that a reconfiguration is necessary, and<br>
by including the Fast Reconfiguration IE, it indicates to the DRNC that the syn-<br>
chronization should be performed via the new method as shown in step 1.<br>
[183]	In step 2, the DRNC can then determine whether the necessary resources are<br>
available, and if necessary, allocate DL OVSF codes from a different branch of the<br>
code tree, i.e. codes that are uncorrelated in order to allow the simultaneous broadcast<br>
of the old and the new DL DPCCH channels. If the new IE is not understood the<br>
DRNC will ignore this information, and not send the Fast Reconfiguration IE in the<br>
RADIO LINK RECONFIGURATION READY message which allows the SRNC to<br>
understand that the legacy procedure should be used, and the DRNC performs the<br>
legacy procedure as shown hi steps 3b, 4b, 5b and 6b.<br>
[184]	In the case that the checking and resource reservation in step 2 was successful, the<br>
DRNC indicates to the NodeB that the synchronization of the reconfiguration should<br>
be based on the UL scrambling code as shown in step 3a, which allows the NodeB in<br>
step 4a to reserve the necessary resources and determine whether the new method is<br>
supported or not. In the case that the NodeB does not comprehend the Fast Recon-<br>
figuration IE the NodeB proceeds with the legacy method as shown in steps 4b, 5b and<br>
6b.<br>
[185]	As explained above in the case that the slot format is changed during the recon-<br>
figuration it is preferable that the DL spreading codes used prior to the reconfiguration<br>
and after the reconfiguration are used from a different branch of the code tree. This is<br>
due to the fact that this allows firstly to transmit the DL DPCCH of the old and the new<br><br>
26<br>
WO 2006/118426	PCT/KR2006/001672<br>
configuration in parallel, and secondly that during the frames during which the NodeB<br>
applies the old configuration and the UE supposes that the new configuration is<br>
transmitted the UE would interpret, e.g., the pilot bits sent by the NodeB using the old<br>
configuration with the old spreading code and the old slot format as the TPC bits in the<br>
new configuration. This can happen due to the fact that the OVSF codes from the same<br>
branch with different spreading factors are not necessarily orthorgonal and the patterns<br>
for the DPCCH in different slot formats is not the same.<br>
[186]	Regarding the complexity in the NodeB and system impact, the impact of the<br>
present invention scheme on the NodeB implementation of course depends largely on<br>
the details of the actual NodeB implementation. However, the complexity due to the<br>
need to receive and optionally transmit simultaneously on an old and a new con-<br>
figuration is always inferior to the complexity of a hard handover where two<br>
completely independent channel estimations and receptions need to be performed. Also<br>
it should be highlighted that the duration of reception of the old and the new con-<br>
figuration is smaller than the double reception in the case that the hard handover<br>
procedure is used due to the fact that the earliest time is included in the Radio Link Re-<br>
configuration Commit message.<br>
[187]	Alternative proposals with UE impact have been proposed. Such would allow the<br>
use of reconfiguration with the activation time NOW instead of using the synchronized<br>
radio link reconfiguration. It is proposed that the UE e.g. changes the TFCI pattern<br>
used, the FBI bits or that the UE uses a different pilot pattern already before it applies<br>
the new configuration. This would allow the NodeB to detect that the change of the<br>
configuration will happen soon. However, this implies that there is additional delay<br>
introduced due to the fact that the UE does not apply the new configuration im-<br>
mediately. Also, the reliability of such a scheme is not necessarily higher, since the re-<br>
liability depends mainly on the power sent in the UL, and the number of FBI or TFCI<br>
bits is in all slot formats smaller than the number of the pilot bits. Therefore, we<br>
consider that the additional complexity in the UE, and the availability of such a<br>
procedure only in the most recent terminals and networks (e.g., Release 7) may not be<br>
as attractive as the present invention, which proposes a method that allows to reduce<br>
the delay for reconfigurations to be reduced by several hundreds of milliseconds,<br>
without impacting the UE implementation.<br>

informing the terminal to apply the second configuration; and<br>
determining when the terminal uses the second configuration based on the<br>
reception of a radio signal from the terminal.<br>
[2]	The method of claim 1, wherein the determining comprises: detecting that the<br>
terminal will apply or has applied the second configuration.<br>
[3]	The method of claim 1, wherein the determining comprises: comparing a power<br>
of a first radio resource and a power of a second radio resource.<br>
[4]	The method of claim 1, wherein the radio signal from the terminal corresponds to<br>
a control channel.<br>
[5]	The method of claim 4, wherein the control channel comprises pilot bits<br>
modulated by a scrambling code that is different from a scrambling code used for<br>
the first configuration.<br>
[6]	The method of claim 1, wherein the radio signal is considered to be received<br>
when a power of a second uplink scrambling code is higher than a power of a<br>
first uplink scrambling code.<br>
[7]	.    The method of claim 6, wherein the second uplink scrambling code is given by<br>
the network together with the second configuration.<br>
[8]	The method of claim 4, wherein the control channel comprises at least one of<br>
FBI bits, uplink scrambling code, special bit pattern, and a set of TFCI.<br>
[9]	The method of claim 1, the initiating step comprises:<br>
receiving information about the second configuration from a radio network<br>
controller; and<br>
reserving necessary transport resources for the second configuration.<br>
[ 10]	The method of claim 1, further comprising:<br>
releasing the old configuration after the determining step.<br>
[11]	The method of claim 1, further comprising:<br>
transmitting, to the terminal, an indication to use the second configuration<br>
without interrupting uplink transmission.<br>
[12]	The method of claim 1, wherein signaling using at least parts of the first con-<br>
figuration and at least parts of the second configuration are performed in parallel.<br>
[ 13]	The method of claim 1, further comprising:<br>
prior to the initiating step, determining whether a Node B of the network is able<br><br>
28<br>
WO 2006/118426	PCT/KR2006/001672<br>
to support the first and second configurations.<br>
[14]	A method of changing a radio access configuration between a terminal and a<br>
network, the method comprising:<br>
receiving information to apply a second configuration;<br>
transmitting, to the network, a radio signal indicating a change in configuration;<br>
and<br>
changing from a first configuration to the second configuration at a pre-<br>
determined time after transmitting the radio signal.<br>
[15]	The method of claim 14, wherein the radio signal indicating the change in con-<br>
figuration is comprised in the second configuration given by the network.<br>
[16]	The method of claim 14, further comprising:<br>
continuously transmitting after applying the second configuration for a certain<br>
duration despite no reception using the second configuration.<br>
[17]	The method of claim 14, further comprising:<br>
receiving, from the network, an indication to use the second configuration<br>
without interrupting uplink transmission.<br><br>
A method of changing a radio access configuration between a terminal and a network. The network performs the steps of: initiating a new configuration that is related to an old configuration for the same terminal; informing<br>
the terminal to apply the second configuration;<br>
and determining when the terminal uses the second configuration based on the reception of a radio signal from the terminal. The terminal performs the steps of: receiving information to apply a new configuration; transmitting, to the network, a radio signal indicating a change in configuration; and changing from an old configuration<br>
to the new configuration at a predetermined time after transmitting the radio signal.<br></td>
