				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
COMBINATION WEIGHER AND WEIGHING SYSTEM USING THE SAME<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a combination weigher and a weighing system<br>
which feed to a packaging machine or the like, objects to be weighed which have been<br>
weighed.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002] Objects to be weighed, such as detergents and confectionary, which have been<br>
weighed to have specified weight by a combination weigher, are typically packaged by a<br>
packaging machine. A schematic construction of a first conventional example of such a<br>
combination weigher which weighs the objects to be weighed is shown in Fig. 13.<br>
[0003] The combination weigher of Fig. 13 is configured such that a control unit 30<br>
controls an operation of the entire combination weigher and performs combination<br>
calculation. The combination weigher is constructed in such a manner that a center<br>
base body (body) 11 is disposed at a center of the combination weigher, and a dispersion<br>
feeder 1 having a conical shape is mounted io an upper part of the center base body 11 to<br>
radially disperse objects to be weighed supplied from an external supplying device by<br>
vibration. Around the dispersion feeder 1, linear feeders 2 are provided to transfer the<br>
objects to be weighed which have been sent from the dispersion feeder 1 into respective<br>
feeding hoppers 3 by vibration. A plurality of feeding hoppers 3 and weighing hoppers<br>
4 are disposed below the linear feeders 2 and are arranged in a circular shape in such a<br>
manner that each feeding hopper 3 and each weighing hopper 4 correspond to the<br>
associated one of the linear feeders 2. The feeding hopper 3 receives the objects to be<br>
weighed which have been sent from the linear feeder 2, and opens its gate to feed the<br>
objects to be weighed to the weighing hopper 4 located therebelow when the weighing<br>
hopper 4 becomes empty. The weighing hopper 4 is attached with a weight sensor 41<br>
such as a load cell. The weight sensor 41 measures weight of the objects to be weighed<br><br>
inside the weighing hopper 4. The control unit 30 performs combination calculation to<br>
determine a combination made up of hoppers which will discharge the objects to be<br>
weighed, from the plurality of weighing hoppers 4. The weighing hoppers 4<br>
corresponding to the combination discharge the objects to be weighed onto a collecting<br>
chute 12. The collecting chute 12 is disposed below the weighing hoppers 4. The<br>
objects to be weighed which have been discharged from the weighing hoppers 4 slide<br>
down on the collecting chute 12 and are held in a collecting hopper 13 provided at a<br>
discharge outlet in a bottom part of the collecting chute 12. Thereafter, the objects to be<br>
weighed are sent out to a packaging machine which is not shown. While manufacturing<br>
package bags, the packaging machine charges the objects to be weighed which have been<br>
discharged from the combination weigher into the package bags and packages them.<br>
[0004] In order to enable the combination weigher to be adapted to a high-speed<br>
operated packaging machine, it is necessary to provide a collecting hopper 13 at a<br>
discharge outlet of the collecting chute 12 so that the objects to be weighed are<br>
discharged in a state where they are lumped together, and to shorten a discharge cycle<br>
time. To this end, conventionally, the number of weighing hoppers was increased to a<br>
certain degree to configure so that a double shift operation is carried out rather than a<br>
single shift operation, thereby reducing the discharge cycle time taken for the single shift<br>
operation by half. The single shift operation is carried out in a configuration in which,<br>
for example, a total number of the weighing hoppers 4 is set to ten, the number of the<br>
weighing hoppers 4 selected to make up of a combination is set to four, the combination<br>
calculation is performed once within one weighing cycle time, the weighing hoppers 4<br>
perform discharge operation once within one weighing cycle time, and the collecting<br>
hopper 13 performs discharge operation with respect to the packaging machine once<br>
within one weighing cycle time. In order to achieve weighing precision substantially as<br>
high as that in the single shift operation when the double shift operation is carried out,<br>
the number of the weighing hoppers 4 is increased by four so that a total number of them<br>
is fourteen and the number of the weighing hoppers 4 selected to make up of the<br><br>
combination is set to four. And, the combination calculation is performed once in every<br>
1/2 of one weighing cycle time, weighing hoppers 4 making up of a combination selected<br>
in the combination calculation discharge the objects to be weighed, and according to the<br>
discharge, the collecting hopper 13 discharges the objects to be weighed. That is, the<br>
combination calculation is performed twice within one weighing cycle time, the<br>
weighing hoppers 4 performs the discharge operation twice within one weighing cycle<br>
time, and the collecting hopper 13 performs the discharge operation with respect to the<br>
packaging machine twice within one weighing cycle time. This makes it possible to<br>
improve productivity within a specified time period (the total number of times the<br>
combination weigher discharges the objects to be weighed to the packaging machine) and<br>
hence to adapt the combination weigher to the high-speed operated packaging machine.<br>
[0005] However, even when the conventional combination weigher shown in Fig. 13<br>
is configured to carry out the double shift operation, a batch length of the objects to be<br>
weighed which have been discharged from the weighing hoppers 4 and slide on the<br>
collecting chute 12 is not reduced. For this reason, a distance between the batches of<br>
the objects to be weighed discharged from the weighing hoppers 4 selected to make up of<br>
a previous combination and the objects to be weighed discharged from the weighing<br>
hoppers 4 selected to make up of a subsequent combination is insufficiently large and the<br>
objects to be weighed in the previous and subsequent combinations are likely to be mixed,<br>
making it difficult to carry out the double shift operation at a specified operation speed.<br>
To solve this problem, two collecting chutes may be provided as shown in Fig. 14.<br>
[0006] Fig. 14(a) is a schematic partial cross-sectional view showing a second example<br>
of the conventional combination weigher as viewed from laterally. Fig. 14(b) is a<br>
schematic view of collecting chutes (inner chute and outer chute) and weighing hoppers<br>
of the combination weigher as viewed from above. The combination weigher is<br>
configured in such a manner that a lower chute is incorporated into the combination<br>
weigher disclosed in a patent document 1 to discharge objects to be weighed into a<br>
packaging machine having one inlet.<br><br>
[0007] In the combination weigher, two collecting chutes, i.e., an inner chute 6 and an<br>
outer chute 7 are provided, and each weighing hopper 4 has two gates (not shown) to be<br>
able to discharge objects to be weighed selectively to the inner chute 6 or the outer chute<br>
7 which is located therebelow. In addition, a collecting hopper 8 is provided at an<br>
discharge outlet 6e in a bottom part of the inner chute 6 to hold and discharge the objects<br>
to be weighed, and a collecting hopper 9 is provided at an discharge outlet 7e in a bottom<br>
part of the outer chute 7 to hold and discharge the objects to be weighed. Furthermore,<br>
one lower chute 10 is provided below the two collecting hoppers 8 and 9 to feed the<br>
objects to be weighed which have been discharged from the collecting hoppers 8 and 9<br>
into one inlet of the packaging machine. A control unit 31 controls an operation of the<br>
entire combination weigher and performs combination calculation. The combination<br>
weigher is configured to carry out the double shift operation in such a manner that the<br>
weighing hoppers 4 selected sequentially to make up of the combinations discharge the<br>
objects to be weighed alternately to the inner chute 6 and the outer chute 7 and the<br>
collecting hopper 8 and the collecting hopper 9 alternately discharge the objects to be<br>
weighed to the lower chute 10. Thereby, the objects to be weighed are discharged twice<br>
frum the discharge outlet 10e of the lower chute 10 within one weighing cycle time. So,<br>
productivity within a specified time period can be improved. Also, since the weighing<br>
hoppers 4 discharge the objects to be weighed to each of the inner chute 6 and the outer<br>
chute 7 only once within one weighing cycle time, a sufficient distance is provided<br>
between the batches of the objects to be weighed which are discharged previously and<br>
the objects to be weighed which are discharged subsequently on each of the chutes.<br>
[0008] In cases where the combination weigher is not equipped with the lower chute<br>
10, two packaging machines or a twin-inlet packaging machine having two inlets are/ is<br>
disposed below the combination weigher, and the objects to be weighed which have been<br>
discharged from the collecting hoppers 8 and 9 are fed into the associated packaging<br>
machine inlets. In this case, by the double shift operation, the objects to be weighed are<br>
discharged once to each of the two packaging machine inlets within one weighing cycle<br><br>
time. That is, the objects to be weighed are discharged twice in total within one<br>
weighing cycle time irrespective of the presence or absence of the lower chute 10. Thus,<br>
productivity within a specified time period can be improved.<br>

Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
[0009] However, in the configuration of Fig. 14, the outer chute 7 is disposed so that<br>
the objects to be weighed which have been discharged from the weighing hopper 4<br>
located closer to the collecting hopper 8 of the inner chute 6 to the outer chute 7 are<br>
transferred to the collecting hopper 9 through the outside of the periphery of the inner<br>
chute 6. Therefore, the collecting chute consisting of the outer chute and the inner<br>
chute is complicated in structure.<br>
[0010] In addition, since the collecting hoppers 8 and 9 respectively provided at the<br>
inner chute 6 and the ouier chuie 7 are positioned distant from a center of a circle formed<br>
by arrangement of the weighing hoppers 4, a distance over which the objects to be<br>
weighed are transferred from the weighing hopper 4 to the collecting hopper 8 and<br>
inclination of the chute 6 is varied significantly, and a distance over which the objects to<br>
be weighed are transferred from the weighing hopper 4 to the collecting hopper 9 and<br>
inclination of the chute 7 is varied significantly, depending on the position of the<br>
weighing hopper 4 with respect to the collecting hopper 8 or 9. For this reason, there is<br>
a significant variation in time when the objects to be weighed which have been<br>
transferred on the chute 6 or 7 reach the collecting hopper 8 or 9. In particular, since<br>
the objects to be weighed which have been discharged from the weighing hopper 4<br>
located closer to the collecting hopper 8 of the inner chute 6 to the outer chute 7 are<br>
transferred to the collecting hopper 9 through the outside of the periphery of the inner<br><br>
chute 6, they reach at a time that is much later than a time when the objects to be<br>
weighed which have been discharged from the weighing hopper 4 located closer to the<br>
collecting hopper 9 reach the collecting hopper 9. As a result, there is a significant<br>
variation in the time when the objects to be weighed reach the collecting hopper 9.<br>
Thus, there is a significant variation in the time when the objects to be weighed which<br>
have been discharged simultaneously from the plurality of weighing hoppers 4 to the<br>
inner chute 6 or to the outer chute 7 reach the collecting hopper 8 or 9, and time that<br>
lapses from when a tip part of the batch of the objects to be weighed reach the collecting<br>
hopper 8 or the collecting hopper 9 until a tail part of the batch of the objects to be<br>
weighed reach the collecting hopper 8 or to the collecting hopper 9 is long. In this case,<br>
also, a sufficient distance is unable to be provided between the batches of the objects to<br>
be weighed which are discharged onto the collecting chute 6 or 7 previously and the<br>
objects to be weighed which are discharged onto the collecting chute 6 or 7 subsequently<br>
and they are likely to be mixed, unless an operation speed is set slow, depending on<br>
characteristic of the objects to be weighed, for example, if the objects to be weighed are<br>
bulky (bulk density is low). As a result, the combination weigher is unable to operate at<br>
a high Speed.<br>
[0011] The present invention has been made to solve the above described problem,<br>
and an object of the present invention is to provide a combination weigher and a<br>
weighing system which are equipped with collecting chutes having a relatively simple<br>
structure, and are able to operate at a high speed irrespective of characteristics of almost<br>
all objects to be weighed.<br>
Means for Solving the Problem<br>
[0012] To achieve the above described objective, a combination weigher of the<br>
present invention comprises a combination hopper line formed by a plurality of<br>
combination hoppers which are arranged in a circular-arc shape having a central angle of<br>
approximately 180 degrees or smaller and are fed with objects to be weighed, the<br>
plurality of combination hoppers being each configured to be able to discharge the<br><br>
objects to be weighed selectively in an inward direction which is toward a center of the<br>
circular-arc shape or in an outward direction which is an opposite direction of the inward<br>
direction; an inner chute which is disposed below the combination hopper line and has an<br>
upper end portion of a circular-arc shape conforming to the shape of the combination<br>
hopper line, the inner chute being configured to gather the objects to be weighed which<br>
have been discharged in the inward direction from the combination hoppers and to<br>
discharge the objects to be weighed from a discharge outlet provided at a bottom part<br>
thereof; an outer chute which is disposed along outside of the inner chute, the outer chute<br>
being configured to gather the objects to be weighed which have been discharged in the<br>
outward direction from the combination hoppers and to discharge the objects to be<br>
weighed from a discharge outlet provided at a bottom part thereof; a first collecting<br>
hopper which is provided at the discharge outlet of the inner chute to hold and discharge<br>
the objects to be weighed which have been discharged from the discharge outlet of the<br>
inner chute; a second collecting hopper which is provided at the discharge outlet of the<br>
outer chute to hold and discharge the objects to be weighed which have been discharged<br>
from the discharge outlet of the outer chute; a combination calculation means which is<br>
configured to determine a first discharge combination and a second discharge<br>
combination each of which is made up of combination hoppers in which a combination<br>
weight value which is a total of weights of the objects to be weighed which have been<br>
fed to the combination hoppers is within an allowable range with respect to a target<br>
weight value; and a control means which is configured to cause the combination hoppers<br>
making up of the first discharge combination to discharge the objects to be weighed in<br>
the inward direction and to cause the combination hoppers making up of the second<br>
discharge combination to discharge the objects to be weighed in the outward direction,<br>
and is configured to cause the first collecting hopper holding the objects to be weighed<br>
which have been discharged from the combination hoppers making up of the first<br>
discharge combination to discharge the objects to be weighed and to cause the second<br>
collecting hopper holding the objects to be weighed which have been discharged from the<br><br>
combination hoppers making up of the second discharge combination to discharge the<br>
objects to be weighed.<br>
[0013] In such a configuration, since the inner chute is disposed to correspond to the<br>
combination hopper line of the circular-arc shape having a central angle of approximately<br>
180 degrees or smaller, and the outer chute is disposed along outside of the inner chute,<br>
the collecting chutes (inner chute and outer chute) can be made to have a relatively<br>
simple structure. In addition, it becomes possible to shorten and substantially equalize<br>
a distance over which the objects to be weighed which have been discharged from the<br>
combination hoppers to the inner chute are transferred to the associated collecting hopper<br>
and a distance over which the objects to be weighed which have been discharged from<br>
the combination hoppers to the outer chute are transferred to the associated collecting<br>
hopper. Irrespective of the characteristics of almost all the objects to be weighed, the<br>
objects to be weighed which have been discharged from the combination hoppers can be<br>
gathered to the associated collecting hoppers in a short time. Therefore, the collecting<br>
chutes can be made to have a relatively simple structure, and the combination weigher is<br>
able to operate at a high speed irrespective of the characteristics of almost all the objects<br>
to be weighed.<br>
[0014] The combination calculation means may be configured to repeatedly perform a<br>
combination process in which combination calculation is performed based on the weights<br>
of the objects to be weighed which have been fed to the combination hoppers to<br>
determine one combination made up of the combination hoppers in which a combination<br>
weight value is within the allowable range with respect to the target weight value and to<br>
determine the combination as an optimal combination; and the combination calculation<br>
means may be configured to repeatedly perform the combination process n (plural<br>
number) times in such a manner that, the combination calculation is performed based on<br>
weights of objects to be weighed which have been fed to combination hoppers which do<br>
not make up of an optimal combination determined in a previous combination process, in<br>
a subsequent combination process, and may be configured to determine optimal<br><br>
combinations determined sequentially in the combination process performed repeatedly<br>
as the first discharge combination and the second discharge combination alternately; the<br>
control means may be configured to cause the combination hoppers making up of the<br>
first discharge combination and the combination hoppers making up of the second<br>
discharge combination to alternately discharge the objects to be weighed and to cause the<br>
first collecting hopper and the second collecting hopper to alternately discharge the<br>
objects to be weighed, based on the first discharge combination and the second discharge<br>
combination alternately determined by the combination calculation means; and wherein<br>
the objects to be weighed which have been discharged from the first collecting hopper<br>
and the objects to be weighed which have been discharged from the second collecting<br>
hopper may be fed to the same packaging machine inlet.<br>
[0015] In such a configuration, since the combination process can be performed n<br>
times and the objects to be weighed can be discharged to the same packaging machine<br>
inlet n times within one operation cycle time (e.g., one weighing cycle time),<br>
productivity (the number of times the objects to be weighed are discharged from the<br>
combination weigher to the packaging machine) within a specified time period can be<br>
improved. In addition, since the objects to be weighed inside the combination hoppers<br>
are discharged to the inner chute and to the outer chute alternately for the respective<br>
discharge combinations determined sequentially, that is, the objects to be weighed are<br>
discharged from the combination hoppers to the inner chute and to the outer chute only<br>
n/2 times within one operation cycle time, a sufficient distance can be provided between<br>
the batches of the objects to be weighed which are discharged previously and the objects<br>
to be weighed which are discharged subsequently on each of the chutes, even when the<br>
combination weigher carries out a high-speed-operation. In the case of n = 2, a double<br>
shift operation takes place, while in the case of n = 3, a triple shift operation takes place.<br>
[0016] The combination calculation means may be configured to repeatedly perform a<br>
combination process in which combination calculation is performed based on the weights<br>
of the objects to be weighed which have been fed to the combination hoppers to<br><br>
10<br>
determine one combination made up of the combination hoppers in which a combination<br>
weight value is within the allowable range with respect to the target weight value and to<br>
determine the combination as an optimal combination; and the combination calculation<br>
means may be configured to repeatedly perform the combination process n (plural<br>
number) times in such a manner that, the combination calculation is performed based on<br>
weights of objects to be weighed which have been fed to combination hoppers which do<br>
not make up of an optimal combination determined in a previous combination process, in<br>
a subsequent combination process, and may be configured to determine optimal<br>
combinations determined sequentially in the combination process performed repeatedly<br>
as the first discharge combination and the second discharge combination alternately; the<br>
control means may be configured to cause the combination hoppers making up of the<br>
first discharge combination and the combination hoppers making up of the second<br>
discharge combination to alternately discharge the objects to be weighed and to cause the<br>
first collecting hopper and the second collecting hopper to alternately discharge the<br>
objects to be weighed, based on the first discharge combination and the second discharge<br>
combination alternately determined by the combination calculation means; and wherein<br>
the objects to be weighed which have been discharged from the first collecting hopper<br>
and the objects to be weighed which have been discharged from the second collecting<br>
hopper may be fed to different packaging machine inlets.<br>
[0017] In such a configuration, since the combination process can be performed n<br>
times and the objects to be weighed can be discharged to each of the two packaging<br>
machine inlets n/2 times within one operation cycle time (e.g., one weighing cycle time),<br>
the objects to be weighed can be discharged n times in total, and thus, productivity<br>
within a specified time period can be improved. In addition, since the objects to be<br>
weighed inside the combination hoppers are discharged to the inner chute and to the<br>
outer chute alternately for the respective discharges determined sequentially, that is, the<br>
objects to be weighed are discharged from the combination hoppers to the inner chute<br>
and to the outer chute n/2 times within one operation cycle time, a sufficient distance can<br><br>
11<br>
be provided between the batches of the objects to be weighed which are discharged<br>
previously and the objects to be weighed which are discharged subsequently on each of<br>
the chutes, even when the combination weigher carries out a high-speed operation. In<br>
the case of n = 2, double shift operation takes place, while in the case of n = 3, triple<br>
shift operation takes place.<br>
[0018] The combination calculation means may be configured to perform a<br>
combination process in which combination calculation is performed based on the weights<br>
of the objects to be weighed which have been fed to the combination hoppers to<br>
determine two combinations which do not include the same combination hoppers and in<br>
which combination weight values obtained in the combination calculation are within the<br>
allowable range with respect to the target weight value, one of the two combinations may<br>
be determined as the first discharge combination and the other of the two combinations is<br>
determined as the second discharge combination; wherein the control means may be<br>
configured to cause the combination hoppers making up of the first discharge<br>
combination and the combination hoppers making up of the second discharge<br>
combination which have been determined by the combination calculation means to<br>
discharge the objects to be weighed simultaneously, and to cause the first collecting<br>
hopper and the second collecting hopper to discharge the objects to be weighed<br>
simultaneously; and wherein the objects to be weighed which have been discharged from<br>
the first collecting hopper and the objects to be weighed which have been discharged<br>
from the second collecting hopper may be fed to different packaging machine inlets.<br>
[0019] In such a configuration, since the objects to be weighed can be discharged once<br>
from each of the first and second collecting hoppers, within one operation cycle time<br>
(e.g., one weighing cycle time) which is a time taken from when two discharge<br>
combinations are determined until subsequent two discharge combinations are<br>
determined, productivity within a specified time period can be improved. In addition,<br>
since the objects to be weighed inside the combination hoppers making up of one of the<br>
two discharge combinations determined simultaneously are discharged to the inner chute<br><br>
12<br>
and the objects to be weighed inside the combination hoppers making up of the other<br>
discharge combination are discharged to the outer chute, that is, the objects to be<br>
weighed are discharged from the combination hoppers to each of the inner chute and to<br>
the outer chute only once within one operation cycle time, a sufficient distance can be<br>
provided between the batches of the objects to be weighed which are discharged<br>
previously and the objects to be weighed which are discharged subsequently on each of<br>
the chutes, even when the combination weigher carries out a high-speed operation.<br>
Furthermore, since the two discharge combinations which will discharge the objects to be<br>
weighed within one operation cycle are determined simultaneously, weights of the<br>
objects to be weighed of all the combination hoppers can be used in the combination<br>
calculation for determining the two discharge combinations. As a result, combination<br>
weighing precision for the objects to be weighed which are discharged can be improved<br>
as a whole.<br>
[0020] The combination hopper line may include two lines which are upper and lower<br>
combination hopper lines, combination hoppers forming the upper combination hopper<br>
line may be weighing hoppers which weigh weights of the objects to be weighed which<br>
have been fed to the weighing hoppers and combination hoppers forming the lower<br>
combination hopper line may be memory hoppers which are provided to respectively<br>
correspond to the weighing hoppers and are fed with the objects to be weighed which<br>
have been weighed in the weighing hoppers; wherein the weighing hoppers may be each<br>
configured to be able to discharge the objects to be weighed selectively to the<br>
corresponding memory hopper or to the outer chute, and the memory hopper may be<br>
configured to be able to discharge the objects to be weighed selectively to the inner chute<br>
or to the outer chute; and wherein the combination calculation means may be configured<br>
to determine a first discharge combination such that a weighing hopper and a<br>
corresponding memory hopper are included in the first discharge combination when the<br>
weighing hopper is selected to make up of the first discharge combination.<br>
[0021] In such a configuration, since the weighing hoppers and the memory hoppers<br><br>
13<br>
arranged at upper and lower positions are equipped as the combination hoppers, the<br>
number of weight values used in the combination calculation can be increased so that<br>
combination weighing precision can be improved, without increasing a diameter of a<br>
circular-arc shape formed by arrangement of the combination hoppers.<br>
[0022] A weighing system of the present invention comprises a plurality of weighing<br>
units each of which includes a combination weigher according to claim 1, the plurality of<br>
weighing units being configured such that combination hopper lines corresponding to the<br>
plurality of weighing units are continuously arranged and combination hoppers<br>
corresponding to the plurality of weighing units are arranged in a circular shape.<br>
[0023] In this case, there are provided P (P : plural number) combination hopper lines<br>
having P circular-arc shaped hopper lines into which a combination hopper group made<br>
up of a plurality of combination hoppers for discharging the objects to be weighed<br>
selectively in the inward direction which is toward a center of the circle shape formed by<br>
arrangement of the hoppers or in the outward direction which is the opposite direction<br>
thereof are divided, P inner chutes and P outer chutes disposed to respectively<br>
correspond to the combination hopper lines, P first collecting hoppers provided at<br>
discharge outlets of the inner chutes and P second collecting hoppers provided at<br>
discharge outlets of the outer chutes. Each weighing unit may be configured to include<br>
combination calculation means and control means in addition to the combination hopper<br>
line, the inner chute, the outer chute, the first collecting hopper, and the second collecting<br>
hopper which are associated with each other. In this case, the combination calculation<br>
means of the respective weighing units may be integrated into one combination<br>
calculation means. Also, control means of the respective weighing units may be<br>
integrated into one control means.<br>
[0024] In the weighing system of the present invention, a plurality of combination<br>
weighers (weighing units) of the present invention are equipped, and therefore<br>
advantages similar to those of the combination weigher of the present invention are<br>
achieved in each weighing unit.<br><br>
14<br>
[0025] Combination calculation means in each of the weighing units may be<br>
configured to repeatedly perform a combination process in which combination<br>
calculation is performed based on the weights of the objects to be weighed which have<br>
been fed to the combination hoppers within the weighing unit to determine one<br>
combination made up of combination hoppers in which a combination weight value is<br>
within an allowable range with respect to a target weight value and to determine the<br>
combination as an optimal combination; and the combination calculation means in each<br>
of the weighing units may be configured to repeatedly perform the combination process<br>
n (plural number) times in such a manner that, the combination calculation is performed<br>
based on weights of objects to be weighed which have been fed to combination hoppers<br>
which do not make up of an optimal combination determined in a previous combination<br>
process, in a subsequent combination process, and may be configured to determine<br>
optimal combinations determined sequentially in the combination process performed<br>
repeatedly as the first discharge combination and the second discharge combination<br>
alternately; the control means in each of the weighing units may be configured to cause<br>
the combination hoppers making up of the first discharge combination and the<br>
combination hoppers making up of the second discharge combination to alternately<br>
discharge the objects to be weighed and to cause the first collecting hopper and the<br>
second collecting hopper within the weighing unit to alternately discharge the objects to<br>
be weighed, based on the first discharge combination and the second discharge<br>
combination alternately determined by the combination calculation means within the<br>
weighing unit; and the objects to be weighed which have been discharged from the first<br>
collecting hopper and from the second collecting hopper belonging to the same weighing<br>
unit may be fed to the packaging machine inlet, and the objects to be weighed which<br>
have been discharged from the first collecting hopper and from the second collecting<br>
hopper belonging to different weighing units are fed to different packaging machine<br>
inlets.<br>
[0026] In such a configuration, since the combination process can be performed n<br><br>
15<br>
times and the objects to be weighed can be discharged to the same packaging machine<br>
inlet n times within one operation cycle time (e.g., one weighing cycle time) in each<br>
weighing unit, productivity (the number of times the objects to be weighed are<br>
discharged from the combination weigher to the packaging machine) within a specified<br>
time period can be improved. In addition, since the objects to be weighed inside the<br>
combination hoppers are discharged to the inner chute and to the outer chute alternately<br>
for the respective discharge combinations determined sequentially, that is, the objects to<br>
be weighed are discharged from the combination hoppers to the inner chute and to the<br>
outer chute only n/2 times within one operation cycle time, a sufficient distance can be<br>
provided between the batches of the objects to be weighed which are discharged<br>
previously and the objects to be weighed which are discharged subsequently on each of<br>
the chutes, even when the combination weigher carries out a high-speed operation. In<br>
the case of n = 2, the double shift operation takes place, while in the case of n = 3, the<br>
triple shift operation takes place.<br>
[0027] A total number of the weighing units may be an even number. The<br>
combination calculation means in each of the weighing units may be configured to<br>
perform a combination process in which combination calculation is performed based on<br>
the weights of the objects to be weighed which have been fed to the combination hoppers<br>
within the weighing unit to determine two combinations which do not include the same<br>
combination hoppers and in which combination measured values obtained in the<br>
combination calculation are within an allowable range with respect to a target weight<br>
value and to determine the two combinations as the first discharge combination and the<br>
second discharge combination; wherein the control means in each of the weighing units<br>
may be configured to perform an internal discharge process for causing the combination<br>
hoppers making up of the first discharge combination determined by the combination<br>
calculation means within the weighing unit and the combination hoppers making up of<br>
the second discharge combination determined by the combination calculation means to<br>
discharge the objects to be weighed simultaneously, and an external discharge process for<br><br>
16<br>
causing the first collecting hopper and the second collecting hopper to discharge the<br>
objects to be weighed simultaneously; wherein two weighing units including<br>
combination hopper lines arranged adjacent each other may be predetermined as a pair<br>
unit, the objects to be weighed which have been discharged from one of the first<br>
collecting hopper and the second collecting hopper of the weighing units forming the pair<br>
unit are fed to one of a pair of packaging machine inlets corresponding to the pair unit,<br>
and the objects to be weighed which have been discharged from the other collecting<br>
hopper are fed to the other packaging machine inlet; and wherein each of the weighing<br>
units may be configured to repeatedly perform a series of processes including the<br>
combination process, the internal discharge process and the external discharge process,<br>
with a time difference of substantially 1/2 of one operation cycle time that lapses from<br>
when an external discharge process in the weighing unit is terminated until a subsequent<br>
external discharge process in the weighing unit starts, between the two weighing units<br>
forming the pair unit.<br>
[0028] In such a configuration, since the objects to be weighed can be discharged once<br>
from each of the first and second collecting hoppers, within one operation cycle time<br>
(e.g., one weighing cycle time) in each weighing unit, productivity within a specified<br>
time period can be improved. In addition, the objects to be weighed can be fed twice<br>
within one operation cycle time to each of the two packaging machine inlets respectively<br>
corresponding to the two weighing units of the pair unit, the weighing system is able to<br>
be adapted to the packaging machine operated at a high speed. Furthermore, since the<br>
objects to be weighed inside the combination hoppers making up of one of the two<br>
discharge combinations determined simultaneously are discharged to the inner chute and<br>
the objects to be weighed inside the combination hoppers making up of the other<br>
discharge combination are discharged to the outer chute in each weighing unit, that is, the<br>
objects to be weighed are discharged once from the combination hoppers to the inner<br>
chute and to the outer chute within one operation cycle time, a sufficient distance can be<br>
provided between the batches of the objects to be weighed which are discharged<br><br>
17<br>
previously and the objects to be weighed which are discharged subsequently on each of<br>
the chutes, even when the combination weigher carries out a high-speed operation.<br>
Moreover, since the two discharge combinations which will discharge the objects to be<br>
weighed within one operation cycle time are determined simultaneously, the weights of<br>
the objects to be weighed of all the combination hoppers within each weighing unit can<br>
be used in the combination calculation for determining two discharge combinations. As<br>
a result, combination weighing precision for the objects to be weighed which are<br>
discharged can be improved as a whole.<br>
[0029] The combination calculation means in each of the weighing units may be<br>
configured to perform a first process in which the combination calculation is performed<br>
based on the weights of the objects to be weighed which have been fed to the<br>
combination hoppers within the weighing unit to determine, as optimal combinations,<br>
combinations made up of combination hoppers in which combination weight values are<br>
within the allowable range with respect to the target weight value, and to determine<br>
optimal combination sets each of which is formed by combining two optimal<br>
combinations which do not include the same combination hoppers; and a second process<br>
in which for each of the optimal combination sets, a total of absolute values of<br>
differences between combination weight values of the optimal combinations included in<br>
the optimal combination set and the target weight value are calculated to select one<br>
optimal combination set in which the total of the absolute values of the differences is<br>
smallest, and one of two optimal combinations included in the selected optimal<br>
combination set is determined as the first discharge combination and the other optimal<br>
combination is determined as the second discharge combination.<br>
[0030] In such a configuration, combination weighing precision for the objects to be<br>
weighed which are discharged from the combination hoppers making up of the respective<br>
discharge combinations can be improved as a whole.<br>
[0031] The combination calculation means in each of the weighing units may be<br>
configured to perform a first process in which the combination calculation is performed<br><br>
18<br>
based on weights of the objects to be weighed which have been fed to the combination<br>
hoppers within the weighing unit to determine, as allowable combinations, combinations<br>
made up of combination hoppers in which combination weight values are within the<br>
allowable range with respect to the target weight value, m (m: plural number) allowable<br>
combinations are selected, as first optimal combinations, from the allowable<br>
combinations, by giving priority to allowable combinations in which absolute values of<br>
differences between combination weight values and the target weight value are smaller,<br>
one allowable combination is selected as a second optimal combination from allowable<br>
combinations made up of combination hoppers obtained by excluding the combination<br>
hoppers belonging to each of the first optimal combinations, and m optimal combination<br>
sets each of which is made up of corresponding first and second optimal combinations<br>
are determined; and a second process in which for each of the optimal combination sets,<br>
a total of absolute values of differences between combination weight values of the first<br>
and second optimal combinations and the target weight value is calculated to select one<br>
optimal combination set in which the total of the absolute values of the differences is<br>
smallest, one of the first and second optimal combinations included in the selected<br>
optimal combination is determined as the first discharge combination and the other of the<br>
first and second optimal combinations is determined as the second discharge<br>
combination.<br>
[0032] In such a configuration, combination weighing precision for the objects to be<br>
weighed which are discharged from the combination hoppers making up of the respective<br>
discharge combinations can be improved as a whole.<br>
[0033] The combination calculation means in each of the weighing units may be<br>
configured to perform the combination calculation based on the weights of the objects to<br>
be weighed which have been fed to the combination hoppers within the weighing unit to<br>
determine, as allowable combinations, combinations made up of the combination hoppers<br>
in which combination weight values are within the allowable range with respect to the<br>
target weight value, to select as a first optimal combination one allowable combination in<br><br>
19<br>
which an absolute value of difference between a combination weight value and the target<br>
weight value is smallest, from the allowable combinations, to select one allowable<br>
combination as a second optimal combination from allowable combinations made up of<br>
combination hoppers obtained by excluding the combination hoppers belonging to the<br>
first optimal combination, by giving priority to allowable combinations in which absolute<br>
values of differences between combination weight values and the target weight value are<br>
smaller, and to determine that one of the first and second optimal combinations is the<br>
first discharge combination and the other of the first and second optimal combinations is<br>
the second discharge combination.<br>
[0034] In such a configuration, combination weighing precision for the objects to be<br>
weighed which are discharged from the combination hoppers making up of the respective<br>
discharge combinations can be improved as a whole.<br>
The combination calculation means in each of the weighing units may be<br>
configured to perform a combination process in which combination calculation is<br>
performed based on the weights of the objects to be weighed which have been fed to the<br>
combination hoppers within the weighing unit to determine two combinations which do<br>
not include the same combination hoppers and in which combination weight values<br>
obtained in the combination calculation are within the allowable range with respect to the<br>
target weight value, one of the two combinations is determined as the first discharge<br>
combination and the other of the two combinations is determined as the second discharge<br>
combination; wherein the control means in each of the weighing units may be configured<br>
to perform an internal discharge process for causing the combination hoppers making up<br>
of the first discharge combination determined by the combination calculation means<br>
within the weighing unit and the combination hoppers making up of the second discharge<br>
combination determined by the combination calculation means to discharge the objects to<br>
be weighed simultaneously, and an external discharge process for causing the first<br>
collecting hopper and the second collecting hopper to discharge the objects to be<br>
weighed simultaneously; and wherein the plurality of weighing units may be configured<br><br>
20<br>
to perform a series of processes including the combination process, the internal discharge<br>
process and the external discharge process at the same timings, and to feed the objects to<br>
be weighed which have been discharged simultaneously from the first collecting hopper<br>
and from the second collecting hopper of the plurality of weighing units to different<br>
packaging machine inlets.<br>
[0035] In such a configuration, since the objects to be weighed can be discharged once<br>
from the first and second collecting hoppers of the plurality of weighing units within one<br>
operation cycle time (e.g., one weighing cycle time), productivity within a specified time<br>
period can be improved. For example, in cases where k (k : plural number) weighing<br>
units are equipped, the objects to be weighed can be fed simultaneously into (2 X k)<br>
packaging machine inlets within one operation cycle time, the weighing system is able to<br>
be adapted to a packaging machine which packages (2 X k) sets of objects to be<br>
weighed simultaneously. In addition, since the objects to be weighed inside the<br>
combination hoppers making up of one of the two discharge combinations determined<br>
simultaneously are discharged to the inner chute and the objects to be weighed inside the<br>
combination hoppers making up of the other discharge combination are discharged to the<br>
outer chute in each weighing unit, that is, the objects to be weighed are discharged from<br>
the combination hoppers to the inner chute and to the outer chute once within one<br>
operation cycle time, in each weighing unit, a sufficient distance can be provided<br>
between the batches of the objects to be weighed which are discharged previously and<br>
the objects to be weighed which are discharged subsequently on each of the chutes, even<br>
when the weighing system carries out a high-speed operation. Furthermore, since the<br>
two discharge combinations which will discharge the objects to be weighed within one<br>
operation cycle time are determined simultaneously, weights of the objects to be weighed<br>
of all the combination hoppers within the respective weighing units can be used in the<br>
combination calculation for determining the two discharge combinations. As a result,<br>
combination weighing precision for the objects to be weighed which are discharged can<br>
be improved as a whole.<br><br>
21<br>
The combination hopper line of the plurality of weighing units may include two<br>
lines which are upper and lower combination hopper lines, combination hoppers forming<br>
the upper combination hopper line are weighing hoppers which weigh weights of the<br>
objects to be weighed which have been fed to the weighing hoppers, combination<br>
hoppers forming the lower combination hopper line are memory hoppers which are<br>
provided to respectively correspond to the weighing hoppers and are fed with the objects<br>
to be weighed which have been weighed in the weighing hoppers; the weighing hoppers<br>
may be each configured to be able to discharge the objects to be weighed selectively to<br>
the corresponding memory hopper or to the outer chute, and the memory hoppers may be<br>
each configured to be able to discharge the objects to be weighed selectively to the inner<br>
chute or to the outer chute; and wherein the combination calculation means in each of the<br>
weighing units is configured to determine a first discharge combination such that a<br>
weighing hopper and a corresponding memory hopper are included in the first discharge<br>
combination when the weighing hopper is selected to make up of the first discharge<br>
combination.<br>
[0036] In such a configuration, since the weighing hoppers and the memory hoppers<br>
arranged at upper and lower positions are equipped as the combination hoppers, the<br>
number of weight values used in the combination calculation can be increased so that<br>
combination weighing precision can be improved, without increasing a diameter of the<br>
circular shape formed by arrangement of the combination hoppers.<br>

combination weigher and a weighing system which are equipped with collecting chutes<br>
with a relatively simple structure and are capable of operating at a high speed<br>
irrespective of characteristics of almost all the objects to be weighed.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[0040] Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described<br>
with reference to the drawings.<br>
[0041] (Embodiment 1)<br>
[Example 1 of Embodiment 1]<br>
Fig. 1 (a) is a schematic partial cross-sectional view of a combination weigher<br>
(weighing system) according to an example 1 of an embodiment 1 of the present<br>
invention, as viewed from laterally, Fig. l(b) is a schematic view of collecting chutes<br>
(inner chutes and outer chutes), weighing hoppers, and memory hoppers of the<br>
combination weigher as viewed from above, and Fig. l(c) is a schematic view of a lower<br>
chute of the combination weigher as viewed from above.<br>
[0042] As shown in Fig. l(a), the combination weigher is constructed in such a manner<br>
that a center base body (body) 11 is disposed at a center of the combination weigher and<br>
supported by four legs (not shown), and a dispersion feeder 1 having a conical shape is<br>
mounted to an upper part of the center base body 11 to radially disperse objects to be<br>
weighed supplied from an external supplying device by vibration. Around the<br>
dispersion feeder 1, a plurality of linear feeders 2 are provided to transfer the objects to<br>
be weighed sent from the dispersion feeder 1 into respective feeding hoppers 3 by<br>
vibration. A plurality of feeding hoppers 3, a plurality of weighing hoppers 4 and a<br>
plurality of memory hoppers 5 are disposed below the linear feeders 2 and are arranged<br>
in a circular shape around the center base body 11 in such a manner that each feeding<br>
hopper 3, each weighing hopper 4, and each memory hopper 5 correspond to the<br>
associated one of the linear feeders 2. The dispersion feeder 1, the linear feeders 2, the<br>
feeding hoppers 3, the weighing hoppers 4 and the memory hoppers 5 are mounted to the<br>
center base body 11. Inside the center base body 11, drive units therefor (vibration<br><br>
25<br>
device for the dispersion feeder 1 and the linear feeders 2, gate opening and closing<br>
devices for the feeding hoppers 3, the weighing hoppers 4 and the memory hoppers 5,<br>
etc) are accommodated. Each weighing hopper 4 is attached with a weight sensor 41<br>
such as a load cell which measures a weight of the objects to be weighed inside the<br>
weighing hopper 4. The weight sensors 41 are accommodated inside the center base<br>
body 11 along with the drive units. Each weight sensor 41 outputs a measured value to<br>
a control unit 20. Each memory hopper 5 is disposed below and in an inward direction<br>
of the corresponding weighing hopper 4. When the memory hopper 5 becomes empty,<br>
the weighing hopper 4 feeds the objects to be weighed to the memory hopper 5. The<br>
inward direction refers to a direction toward a center of a circle shape formed by<br>
arrangement of the weighing hoppers 4 and the memory hoppers 5, and its opposite<br>
direction refers to an outward direction. Below the memory hoppers 5 arranged in the<br>
circular shape, two inner chutes 6a and 6b formed by dividing in two a chute of a<br>
substantially inverted cone frustum shape are disposed, and outer chutes 7a and 7b are<br>
disposed along outside of the inner chutes 6a and 6b to respectively correspond to the<br>
inner chutes 6a and 6b.<br>
[0043] Each weighing hopper 4 is provided with two gates (not shown) to be able to<br>
selectively discharge the objects to be weighed to the corresponding memory hopper 5 or<br>
to the outer chute 7a or 7b located therebelow. To be more specific, each weighing<br>
hopper 4 is provided with the gate (hereinafter referred to as "inner gate") for<br>
discharging the objects to be weighed to the memory hopper 5 and the gate (hereinafter<br>
referred to as "outer gate") for discharging the objects to be weighed to the outer chute 7a<br>
or 7b. Each memory hopper 5 is provided with two gates (not shown) to be able to<br>
selectively discharge the objects to be weighed to the inner chute 6a or 6b or to the outer<br>
chute 7a or 7b located therebelow. To be more specific, each memory hopper 5 is<br>
provided with the gate (hereinafter referred to as "inner gate" for discharging the objects<br>
to be weighed to the inner chute 6a or 6a and the gate (hereinafter referred to as "outer<br>
gate") for discharging the objects to be weighed to the outer chute 7a or 7b. In Fig. l(a),<br><br>
26<br>
within a circle 21, the substantially actual shapes of the weighing hopper 4 and the<br>
memory hopper 5 are schematically shown, and the shapes of the inner gate 22 and the<br>
outer gate 23 are schematically shown.<br>
[0044] In the example 1, all the weighing hoppers 4 and memory hoppers 5 arranged in<br>
a circular shape are divided into two groups A and B, and the two inner chutes 6a and 6b<br>
are provided to respectively correspond to the two groups A and B, and the two outer<br>
chutes 7a and 7b are provided to respectively correspond to the two groups A and B.<br>
The inner chutes 6a and 6b have upper ends a circular-arc shape to conform to the shape<br>
(circular-arc shape) formed by arrangement of the hoppers of the corresponding groups A<br>
and B. Discharge outlets 6ae and 6be are provided at bottom parts of the inner chutes<br>
6a and 6b which are closer to the center of the circular-arc shape. Collecting hoppers 8a<br>
and 8b are provided at the bottom part discharge outlets 6ae and 6be, respectively to hold<br>
and discharge the objects to be weighed. The outer chutes 7a and 7b disposed along the<br>
outside of the inner chutes 6a and 6b have upper edges of a circular-arc shape.<br>
Discharge outlets 7ae and 7be are provided at bottom parts of the outer chutes 7a and 7b<br>
which are closer to the center of the circular-arc shape. Collecting hoppers 9a and 9b<br>
are provided at the bottom part discharge cutlets 7ae and 7be, respectively to hold and<br>
discharge the objects to be weighed.<br>
[0045] A first combination weigher unit includes the weighing hoppers 4 and the<br>
memory hoppers 5 in the group A, the linear feeder 2, the feeding hopper 3, the inner<br>
chute 6a, the outer chute 7a and the collecting hoppers 8a and 9a disposed to correspond<br>
to the group A. A second combination weigher unit includes the weighing hoppers 4<br>
and the memory hoppers 5 in the group B, the linear feeder 2, the feeding hopper 3, the<br>
inner chute 6b, the outer chute 7b and the collecting hoppers 8b and 9b disposed to<br>
correspond to the group B.<br>
[0046] Below the collecting hoppers 8a and 9a of the first combination weigher unit, a<br>
lower chute 10a is disposed to receive the objects to be weighed which have been<br>
discharged from the collecting hoppers 8a or 9a and discharge them from a bottom part<br><br>
27<br>
discharge outlet 10ae. Likewise, below the collecting hoppers 8b and 9b of the second<br>
combination weigher unit, a lower chute 10b is disposed to receive the objects to be<br>
weighed which have been discharged from the collecting hoppers 8b or 9b and discharge<br>
them from a bottom part discharge outlet 10be.<br>
[0047] Below the lower chutes 10a and 10b of the combination weigher, two packaging<br>
machines (not shown) or a twin-inlet packaging machine (not shown) having two inlets<br>
into which the objects to be weighed are fed are disposed. The objects to be weighed<br>
which have been discharged from the discharge outlet lOae of the lower chute 10a and<br>
from the discharge outlet lObe of the lower chute 10b are respectively fed into different<br>
packaging machine inlets (first and second packaging machine inlets) and are charged<br>
into package bags for packaging. Thus, in the present example, the objects to be<br>
weighed which have been discharged from the collecting hoppers 8a or 9a in the first<br>
combination weigher unit are fed into the first packaging machine inlet through the lower<br>
chute 10a, and the objects to be weighed which have been discharged from the collecting<br>
hoppers 8b or 9b in the second combination weigher unit are fed into the second<br>
packaging machine inlet through the lower chute 10b.<br>
[0048] In the present example, the control unit 20 controls the first combination<br>
weigher unit and the second combination weigher unit so that each of the first<br>
combination weigher unit and the second combination weigher unit operates as a single<br>
combination weigher.<br>
[0049] The control unit 20 includes a control means and a combination calculation<br>
means for each combination weigher unit to control the operation of the entire<br>
combination weigher and to perform a combination process to determine a combination<br>
(discharge combination) made up of the weighing hoppers 4 and the memory hoppers 5<br>
which will discharge the objects to be weighed, for each of the first and second<br>
combination weigher units. In the combination process, the combination calculation is<br>
performed based on measured values (measured values obtained using the weight sensors<br>
41) of the weights of the objects to be weighed inside the weighing hoppers 4 and the<br><br>
28<br>
memory hoppers 5 to determine one combination made up of the weighing hoppers 4 and<br>
the memory hoppers 5 in which a combination measured value (= combination weight<br>
value) which is a total of the measured values is within an allowable range<br>
(predetermined weight range) with respect to a target weight value to determine it as an<br>
optimal combination. The measured values of the objects to be weighed inside the<br>
memory hopper 5 for use in this combination process are measured values obtained using<br>
the weight sensors 41 in the weighing hoppers 4 located thereabove. If the number of<br>
combinations in which the measured values are within the allowable range with respect<br>
to the target weight value is plural, a combination in which, for example, a total<br>
measured value (combination measured value) is closest to the target weight value (or a<br>
combination whose measured value coincides with the target weight value, if any), i.e., a<br>
combination in which an absolute value of a difference between the total measured value<br>
and the target weight value is smallest, is determined as an optimal combination. In the<br>
embodiment 1, the optimal combination is a discharge combination. In the combination<br>
weigher, the target weight value and the allowable range with respect to the target weight<br>
value are predetermined. The allowable range is determined such that the target weight<br>
value is a lower limit value and a value larger than the target weight value is an upper<br>
limit value, for example. By way of example, when the target weight value is set to<br>
400g, the lower limit value of the allowable range is set to 400g which is equal to the<br>
target weight value, and the upper limit value of the allowable range is set to 420g which<br>
is larger than the target weight value. Alternatively, the allowable range may be<br>
determined such that a value smaller than the target weight value is set as the lower limit<br>
value and the upper limit value is not set (In this case, the upper limit value may be<br>
assumed to be infinite). In cases where the allowable rage with respect to the target<br>
weight value is set to a range which is not smaller than the target weight value, that is,<br>
the lower limit value of the allowable range is set to a value equal to the target weight<br>
value, an absolute value of a difference between the combination measured value which<br>
is a total of the measured values of the optimal combinations and the target weight value<br><br>
29<br>
is equal to a value (difference) obtained by subtracting the target weight value from the<br>
combination measured value.<br>
[0050] Hereinafter, the weighing hoppers 4 and the memory hoppers 5 are collectively<br>
referred to as combination hoppers 4 and 5 when they are not distinguished from each<br>
other.<br>
[0051] An outline of the operation of the combination weigher configured as described<br>
above will be first described.<br>
[0052] The objects to be weighed are supplied from the external supplying device to<br>
the dispersion feeder 1. The dispersion feeder 1 feeds the objects to be weighed to the<br>
feeding hopper 3 through the linear feeder 2. The feeding hopper 3 feeds the objects to<br>
be weighed to the weighing hopper 4. The weight sensor 41 measures the weight of the<br>
objects to be weighed which have been fed into the weighing hopper 4, and sends the<br>
measured value to the control unit 20. The objects to be weighed whose weight has<br>
been measured in the weighing hopper 4 are supplied to the memory hopper 5 located<br>
therebelow if the memory hopper 5 is empty. The above described combination process<br>
is performed for each combination weigher unit to determine the discharge combinations<br>
(optimal combinations). Then, the combination hoppers 4 and 5 selected to make up of<br>
the discharge combination discharge the objects to be weighed. When the objects to be<br>
weighed are held in the weighing hopper 4 located above the memory hopper 5 which is<br>
empty, the weighing hopper 4 feeds the objects to be weighed to the memory hopper 5.<br>
The feeding hopper 3 feeds the objects to be weighed to the weighing hopper 4 which is<br>
empty. The linear feeder 2 feeds the objects to be weighed to the feeding hopper 3<br>
which is empty.<br>
[0053] In present embodiment, the combination process is performed sequentially for<br>
each combination weigher unit, and the combination hoppers 4 and 5 selected to make up<br>
of the discharge combinations discharge the objects to be weighed. A discharge<br>
direction in which the combination hoppers 4 and 5 discharge the objects to be weighed<br>
is switched for each discharge combination determined in the combination process. To<br><br>
30<br>
be more specific, the combination hoppers 4 and 5 discharge the objects to be weighed<br>
alternately to the inner chutes 6a or 6b and to the outer chute 7a or 7b for respective of<br>
discharge combinations sequentially determined. According to the discharge, the inner<br>
chute collecting hopper 8a or 8b and the outer chute collecting hoppers 9a or 9b<br>
alternately discharge the objects to be weighed. For example, when the combination<br>
process is repeated for the first combination weigher unit, the combination hoppers 4 and<br>
5 determined in respective combination processes discharge the objects to be weighed<br>
alternately to the inner chute 6a and to the outer chute 7a. In the combination process<br>
for determining the discharge combination for discharging the objects to be weighed to<br>
the inner chute 6a, the weighing hopper 4 is selected to make up of the discharge<br>
combination only when the corresponding memory hopper 5 disposed therebelow is<br>
selected together. In this case, the weighing hopper 4 and the memory hopper 5 open<br>
their inner gates to discharge the objects to be weighed in such a manner that the objects<br>
to be weighed are discharged from the weighing hopper 4 to the inner chute 6a through<br>
the inside of the memory hopper 5. In the combination process for determining the<br>
discharge combination for discharging the objects to be weighed to the inner chute 6a,<br>
the memory hopper 5 can be selected freely to make up of the discharge combination.<br>
In the combination process for determining the discharge combination for discharging the<br>
objects to be weighed to the outer chute 6a, the weighing hopper 4 and the memory<br>
hopper 5 can be selected freely to make up of the discharge combination. The same<br>
applies to the second combination weigher unit.<br>
[0054] Subsequently, an operation of the first and second combination weigher units<br>
which takes place when the first and second combination weigher units are configured to<br>
carry out the double shift operation will be described in detail. In the double shift<br>
operation, by setting the number of weighing hoppers 4 and the number of memory<br>
hoppers 5 to nine or ten in each of the groups A and B, and by setting the number of the<br>
combination hoppers 4 and 5 which will be selected in the combination process (the<br>
number of combination hoppers 4 and 5 which will be selected to make up of the optimal<br><br>
31<br>
combination) to four in each of the groups A and B, high combination weighing precision<br>
is obtained. The phrase "the number of combination hoppers 4 and 5 which will be<br>
selected in the combination process is set to four" means that the linear feeder 2 and<br>
others are configured to operate so that a target feed amount of the objects to be weighed<br>
which are fed from each feeding hopper 3 to the weighing hopper 4 once becomes<br>
substantially 1/4 of a target weight value.<br>
[0055] Fig. 2 is a timing chart showing the double shift operation carried out by each<br>
combination weigher unit in the combination weigher according to the example 1 of<br>
present embodiment.<br>
[0056] One operation cycle time Tw in each combination weigher unit is, for example,<br>
a time period taken to accomplish a procedure in which immediately after a discharge<br>
combination has been determined in a combination process in a previous operation cycle,<br>
weighing hoppers 4 selected to make up of the discharge combination (when these<br>
weighing hoppers 4 are selected to make up of the discharge combination) discharge the<br>
objects to be weighed, the objects to be weighed are subsequently fed to these weighing<br>
hoppers 4 making up of the discharge combination, time for stabilizing the weight<br>
sensors 41 lapses, the weight sensors 41 measure the weights of the objects to be<br>
weighed inside these weighing hoppers 4, and thereafter a combination process is<br>
performed to determine a discharge combination. One weighing cycle time is, for<br>
example, a time period taken to accomplish a procedure in which weighing hoppers 4<br>
selected to make up of a discharge combination determined in a combination process in a<br>
previous operation cycle (when these weighing hoppers 4 are selected to make up of the<br>
discharge combination), start to discharge the objects to be weighed, the objects to be<br>
weighed are subsequently fed to these weighing hoppers 4 making up of the discharge<br>
combination, time for stabilizing the weight sensors 41 lapses, the weight sensors 41<br>
measure the weights of the objects to be weighed inside these weighing hopper 4, and<br>
thereafter a combination process is performed to determine a discharge combination.<br>
Therefore, one weighing cycle time is equal to one operation cycle time Tw in a case<br><br>
32<br>
where an allowance time, a wait time, etc, which lapses from when a discharge<br>
combination is determined in a combination process until hoppers selected to make up of<br>
the discharge combination start to discharge the objects to be weighed is zero. It is<br>
desired that one operation cycle time Tw be equal to one weighing cycle time to make<br>
the combination weigher carry out a high-speed operation. Therefore, in present<br>
embodiment, the one operation cycle time Tw is set equal to or substantially equal to one<br>
weighing cycle time.<br>
[0057] The double shift operation in each combination weigher unit is carried out in<br>
such a manner that a combination process is performed once in every Tw/2 time and<br>
combination hoppers 4 and 5 making up of an optimal combination selected in the<br>
combination process discharge the objects to be weighed. The combination process in<br>
the double shift operation is performed in such a manner that combination calculation is<br>
performed using measured values (weight values) of the objects to be weighed of the<br>
combination hoppers 4 and 5 holding the objects to be weighed whose weight values<br>
have been measured by the weight sensors 41 in each combination weigher unit to select<br>
one combination made up of the combination hoppers 4 and 5 in which a total measured<br>
value is within a specified weight range and to determine it as an optima) combination,<br>
and measured values of all the combination hoppers 4 and 5 are used in combination<br>
calculation in two continuous combination processes. In each combination weigher unit,<br>
the combination hoppers 4 and 5 making up of optimal combinations sequentially<br>
selected resulting from the combination processes repeated once in every Tw/2 time<br>
discharge the objects to be weighed alternately to the inner chute 6a or 6b and to the<br>
outer chute 7a or 7b for respective of the optimal combinations, and according to the<br>
discharge, the collecting hopper 8a or 8b and the collecting hopper 9a and 9b alternately<br>
discharge the objects to be weighed. Thereby, the objects to be weighed are discharged<br>
from each combination weigher unit to the packaging machine twice within one<br>
operation cycle time Tw. In this case, one discharge cycle time Tdl for each<br>
combination weigher unit is equal to 1/2 of one operation cycle time Tw. One<br><br>
33<br>
discharge cycle time Td1 is equal to one packaging cycle time Tp1 for the packaging<br>
machine. Whereas the measured values of all the combination hoppers 4 and 5 in each<br>
combination weigher unit are used in combination calculation in two continuous<br>
combination processes, the measured values of all the combination hoppers 4 and 5 are<br>
not necessarily used. For example, in cases where the total number of the combination<br>
hoppers 4 and 5 is large in each combination weight unit, the measured values of all the<br>
combination hoppers 4 and 5 are sometimes not used in combination calculation in two<br>
continuous combination processes, if the number of measured values used is limited in<br>
one combination calculation, that is, the number is predetermined.<br>
[0058] Receiving, for example, a feed command signal from the packaging machine, as<br>
an input, the control unit 20 causes the inner chute collecting hopper 8a or 8b to open its<br>
gates to discharge the objects to be weighed to the packaging machine in response to the<br>
feed command signal (time t1). And, the control unit 20 causes the combination<br>
hoppers 4 and 5 selected to make up of the optimal combinations to open their inner<br>
gates based on the operation timing of the gate of the collecting hopper 8a or 8b to<br>
discharge the objects to be weighed from the combination hoppers 4 and 5 to the inner<br>
chute 6a or 6b (time tl). Receiving a subsequent feed command signal as an input, the<br>
control unit 20 causes the outer chute collecting hopper 9a or 9b to open its gate to<br>
discharge the objects o be weighed to the packaging machine in response to the feed<br>
command signal (time t2). And, the control unit 20 causes the combination hoppers 4<br>
and 5 selected to make up of the optimal combinations to open their outer gates based on<br>
the operation timing of the gate of the collecting hopper 9a or 9b to discharge the objects<br>
to be weighed from the combination hoppers 4 and 5 to the outer chute 7a or 7b (time t2).<br>
Then, receiving a subsequent feed command signal as an input, the control unit 20 causes<br>
the inner chute collecting hopper 8a or 8b to open its gate to discharge the objects to be<br>
weighed to the packaging machine in response to the feed command signal, and causes<br>
the combination hoppers 4 and 5 selected to make up of the optimal combinations to<br>
open their inner gates to discharge the objects to be weighed from the combination<br><br>
34<br>
hoppers 4 and 5 to the inner chute 6a or 6b (time t3). Thereafter, the similar operation<br>
is repeated.<br>
[0059] In the operation shown in Fig. 2, the objects to be weighed which have been<br>
discharged from the combination hoppers 4 and 5 by opening the inner gates at time t1<br>
are gathered to and held in the inner chute collecting hopper 8a or 8b before time t3, and<br>
the collecting hopper 8a or 8b opens its gate to discharge the objects to be weighed to the<br>
packaging machine at time t3. Likewise, the objects to be weighed which have been<br>
discharged from the combination hoppers 4 and 5 by opening their outer gates at time t2<br>
are gathered to and held in the outer chute collecting hopper 9a or 9b before time t4, and<br>
the collecting hopper 9a or 9b opens its gate to discharge the objects to be weighed to the<br>
packaging machine at time t4.<br>
[0060] As described above, the combination hoppers 4 and 5 making up of the optimal<br>
combinations discharge the objects to be weighed to the inner chute 6a or 6b and to the<br>
outer chute 7a or 7b alternately, and according to the discharge, the inner chute collecting<br>
hopper 8a or 8b and the outer chute collecting hopper 9a or 9b alternately discharge the<br>
objects to be weighed to the packaging machine. Whereas in the operation of Fig. 2, the<br>
opening and closing timings of the gate of the collecting hopper 8a or 8b are the same as<br>
the opening and closing timings of the inner gates of the combination hoppers 4 and 5<br>
and the opening and closing timings of the gate of the collecting hopper 9a or 9b are the<br>
same as the opening and closing timings of the outer gates of the combination hoppers 4<br>
and 5, these are merely exemplary. For example, the control unit 20 may control the<br>
opening and closing timings of the gates of the combination hoppers 4 and 5 based on the<br>
opening and closing timings of the gates of the collecting hoppers 8a, 8b, 9a and 9b to<br>
make the opening and closing timings of the gates different.<br>
[0061] By causing each combination weigher unit to perform the double shift operation<br>
as described above, each combination weigher unit is able to discharge the objects to be<br>
weighed to the packaging machine once in every Tw/2 time at a speed twice as high as<br>
that of the single shift operation. This makes it possible to improve productivity (the<br><br>
35<br>
total number of times the combination weigher discharges the objects to be weighed to<br>
the packaging machine) within a specified time period, and thus to adapt the combination<br>
weigher to the packaging machine operated at a high speed.<br>
[0062] Subsequently, an operation of each combination weigher unit taking place when<br>
the combination weigher unit is configured to carry out a triple shift operation will be<br>
described in detail. In the triple shift operation, by setting the number of weighing<br>
hoppers 4 and the number of memory hoppers 5 respectively to eleven or twelve in each<br>
of the groups A and B, and by setting the number of the combination hoppers 4 and 5<br>
which will be selected in the combination process to four in each of the groups A and B,<br>
high combination weighing precision is obtained.<br>
[0063] Fig. 3 is a timing chart showing the triple shift operation carried out by each<br>
combination weigher unit in the combination weigher according to the example 1 of the<br>
present embodiment.<br>
[0064] The triple shift operation in each combination weigher unit is carried out in such<br>
a manner that a combination process is performed once in every Tw/3 time and the<br>
combination hoppers 4 and 5 making up of an optimal combination selected in the<br>
combination process discharge the objects to be weighed. The combination process in<br>
the triple shift operation is performed in such a manner that for each combination<br>
weigher unit, combination calculation is carried out using measured values (weight<br>
values of the objects to be weighed) of the combination hoppers 4 and 5 holding the<br>
objects to be weighed whose weight values have been measured by the weight sensors 41<br>
to select one combination made up of the combination hoppers 4 and 5 in which a total<br>
measured value is within a predetermined weight range and to determine it as an optimal<br>
combination, and measured values of all the combination hoppers 4 and 5 are used in<br>
combination calculation in three continuous combination processes. In each<br>
combination weigher unit, the combination hoppers 4 and 5 making up of optimal<br>
combinations sequentially selected resulting from repetitive combination processes<br>
performed once in every Tw/3 time discharge the objects to be weighed alternately to the<br><br>
36<br>
inner chute 6a or 6b and to the outer chute 7a or 7b for respective of the optimal<br>
combinations, and according to the discharge, the collecting hopper 8a or 8b and the<br>
collecting hopper 9a or 9b alternately discharge the objects to be weighed. Thereby, the<br>
objects to be weighed are discharged from each combination weigher unit to the<br>
packaging machine three times within one operation cycle time Tw. In this case, one<br>
discharge cycle time Td2 for each combination weigher unit is equal to 1/3 of one<br>
operation cycle time Tw. One discharge cycle time Td2 is equal to one packaging cycle<br>
time Tp2 of the packaging machine. Whereas in each combination weigher unit, the<br>
measured values of all the combination hoppers 4 and 5 are used in combination<br>
calculation in three continuous combination processes, the measured values of all the<br>
combination hoppers 4 and 5 are not necessarily used. For example, in cases where<br>
the total number of the combination hoppers 4 and 5 is large in each combination weight<br>
unit, the measured values of all the combination hoppers 4 and 5 are sometimes not used<br>
in combination calculation in continuous three combination processes, if the number of<br>
measured values used in one combination calculation is limited, that is, the number is<br>
predetermined.<br>
[0065] Receiving, for example, a feed command signal from the packaging machine, as<br>
an input, the control unit 20 causes the inner chute collecting hopper 8a or 8b to open its<br>
gate to discharge the objects to be weighed to the packaging machine in response to he<br>
feed command signal (time t11). And, the control unit 20 causes the combination<br>
hoppers 4 and 5 selected to make up of the optimal combinations to open their inner<br>
gates based on the operation timing of the gate of the collecting hopper 8a or 8b to<br>
discharge the objects to be weighed to the inner chutes 6a or 6b (time t11). Receiving a<br>
subsequent feed command signal as an input, the control unit 20 causes the outer chute<br>
collecting hopper 9a or 9b to open its gate to discharge the objects to be weighed to the<br>
packaging machine in response to the feed command signal (time t12). And, the control<br>
unit 20 causes the combination hoppers 4 and 5 selected to make up of the optimal<br>
combinations to open their outer gates based on the operation timing of the gate of the<br><br>
37<br>
collecting hopper 9a or 9b to discharge the objects to be weighed to the outer chute 7a or<br>
7b (time t12). Then, receiving a subsequent feed command signal as an input, the<br>
control unit 20 causes the inner chute collecting hopper 8a or 8b to open its gate to<br>
discharge the objects to be weighed to the packaging machine, and causes the<br>
combination hoppers 4 and 5 selected to make up of the optimal combinations to open<br>
their inner gates to discharge the objects to be weighed to the inner chute 6a or 6b, in<br>
response to the feed command signal (time t13). Thereafter, the similar operation is<br>
repeated.<br>
[0066] In the operation shown in Fig. 3, the objects to be weighed which have been<br>
discharged from the combination hoppers 4 and 5 by opening their inner gates at time t11<br>
are gathered to and held in the inner chute collecting hopper 8a or 8b before time t13,<br>
and the collecting hopper 8a or 8b opens its gate to discharge the objects to be weighed<br>
to the packaging machine at time t13. Likewise, the objects to be weighed which have<br>
been discharged from the combination hoppers 4 and 5 by opening the outer gates at time<br>
t12 are gathered to and held in the inner chute collecting hopper 9a or 9b before time t14,<br>
and the collecting hopper 9a or 9b opens its gate to discharge the objects to be weighed<br>
to the packaging machine at time t14.<br>
[0067] As described above, the combination hoppers 4 and 5 selected to make up of the<br>
optimal combinations every time combination calculation is performed, discharge the<br>
objects to be weighed to the inner chute 6a or 6b and to the outer chute 7a or 7b<br>
alternately, and according to the discharge, the inner chute collecting hopper 8a or 8b and<br>
the outer chute collecting hopper 9a or 9b alternately discharge the objects to be weighed<br>
to the packaging machine. Whereas in the operation of Fig. 3, the opening and closing<br>
timings of the gate of the collecting hopper 8a or 8b are the same as the opening and<br>
closing timings of the inner gates of the combination hoppers 4 and 5 and the opening<br>
and closing timings of the gate of the collecting hopper 9a or 9b are the same as the<br>
opening and closing timings of the outer gates of the combination hoppers 4 and 5, these<br>
are merely exemplary. For example, the control unit 20 may control the opening and<br><br>
38<br>
closing timings of the gates of the combination hoppers 4 and 5 based on the opening and<br>
closing timings of the gates of the collecting hopper 8a, 8b, 9a or 9b to make the opening<br>
and closing timings of the gates different.<br>
[0068] By causing each combination weigher unit to perform the triple shift operation<br>
as described above, each combination weigher unit discharges the objects to be weighed<br>
to the packaging machine once in every Tw/3 time at a speed three times as high as that<br>
of the single shift operation. This makes it possible to improve productivity within a<br>
specified time period, and thus to adapt the combination weigher to the packaging<br>
machine operated at a high speed.<br>
[0069] Whereas the control unit 20 executes control to cause the first and second<br>
combination weigher units to operate at same timings as illustrated in the timing charts of<br>
Figs. 2 and 3, it may alternatively execute control to cause the first and second<br>
combination weigher units to operate at different timings. In this case, for example, the<br>
control unit 20 may be configured to receive a feed command signal corresponding to the<br>
first combination weigher unit as an input and a feed command signal corresponding to<br>
the second combination weigher unit as an input, from the packaging machine, and to<br>
control the operation of each combination weigher unit based on the associated feed<br>
command signal.<br>
[0070] Since in the example 1, each combination weigher unit is configured in such a<br>
manner that the inner chute 6a or 6b is disposed to correspond to the group A or B of the<br>
combination hoppers 4 and 5 arranged in a circular-arc shape (semi-circular shape in the<br>
example 1) having a central angle of approximately 180 degrees or smaller, and the outer<br>
chute 7a or 7b is disposed along outside of the inner chute 6a or 6b, the collecting chutes<br>
(inner chute and outer chute) can be made to have a relatively simple structure, and the<br>
distance over which the objects to be weighed which have been discharged from the<br>
combination hoppers 4 and 5 to the inner chute 6a or 6b are transferred and the distance<br>
over which the objects to be weighed which have been discharged from the combination<br>
hoppers 4 and 5 to the outer chute 7a or 7b are transferred to the collecting hopper 9a or<br><br>
39<br>
9b can be made short and substantially equal. Irrespective of the characteristics of<br>
almost all objects to be weighed, the objects to be weighed which have been discharged<br>
from the combination hoppers 4 and 5 can be gathered to the associated collecting hopper<br>
9a or 9b in a short time. Therefore, a structure of the collecting chutes can be made<br>
relatively simple, and the combination weigher is able to operate at a high speed<br>
irrespective of the characteristics of almost all the objects to be weighed. In addition,<br>
each combination weigher unit is able to carry out the double shift operation or the triple<br>
shift operation without slowing the operation speed.<br>
[0071 ] [Example 2 of Embodiment 1]<br>
Fig. 4 (a) is a schematic view of collecting chutes (inner chutes and outer<br>
chutes), weighing hoppers and memory hoppers of a combination weigher (weighing<br>
system) according to an example 2 of the embodiment 1 of the present invention, as<br>
viewed from above, and Fig. 4(b) is a schematic view of lower chutes of the combination<br>
weigher as viewed from above.<br>
[0072] In the example 1 shown in Fig. 1, two combination weigher units are equipped,<br>
while in the present example, three combination weigher units are equipped. In the<br>
present example, as in the example 1, the center base body 11, the dispersion feeder 1,<br>
the linear feeders 2, the feeding hoppers 3, the weighing hoppers 4 attached with the<br>
weight sensors 41, and the memory hoppers 5, are equipped, and are identical in<br>
configuration to those of the example 1. Therefore, explanation therefor is omitted.<br>
[0073] In the example 2, all the weighing hoppers 4 and memory hoppers 5 are divided<br>
into three groups A, B, and C, and combination weigher units are equipped to<br>
respectively include the three groups A, B, and C and to respectively correspond to the<br>
groups A, B, and C. So, three inner chutes 6a, 6b, and 6c are equipped to respectively<br>
correspond to the three groups A, B, and C. Collecting hoppers 8a, 8b, and 8c are<br>
respectively provided at bottom part discharge outlets 6ae, 6be, and 6ce of the inner<br>
chutes 6a, 6b, and 6c to hold and discharge the objects to be weighed. Three outer<br>
chutes 7a, 7b, and 7c are provided to respectively correspond to the three groups A, B,<br><br>
40<br>
and C. Collecting hoppers 9a, 9b, and 9c are provided at bottom part discharge outlets<br>
7ae, 7be, and 7ce of the outer chutes 7a, 7b, and 7c to hold and discharge the objects to<br>
be weighed. Hereinafter, a combination weigher unit including the group A is referred<br>
to as a first combination weigher unit, a combination weigher unit including the group B<br>
is referred to as a second combination weigher unit, and a combination weigher unit<br>
including the group C is referred to as a third combination weigher unit.<br>
[0074] Below the collecting hoppers 8a and 9a of the first combination weigher unit, a<br>
lower chute 10a is provided to receive the objects to be weighed which have been<br>
discharged from the collecting hopper 8a or 9a and to discharge the objects to be weighed<br>
from a bottom part discharge outlet 10ae thereof. Likewise, below the collecting<br>
hoppers 8b and 9b of the second combination weigher unit, a lower chute 10b is provided<br>
to receive the objects to be weighed which have been discharged from the collecting<br>
hopper 8b or 9b and to discharge the objects to be weighed from a bottom part discharge<br>
outlet 10be thereof. Likewise, below the collecting hoppers 8c and 9c of the third<br>
combination weigher unit, a lower chute 10c is provided to receive the objects to be<br>
weighed which have been discharged from the collecting hopper 8c or 9c and to<br>
discharge the objects to be weighed from a bottom part discharge outlet 10ce thereof.<br>
[0075] Below the lower chutes 10a, 10b and 10c of the combination weigher, three<br>
packaging machines (not shown) or a packaging machine (not shown) having three inlets<br>
into which the objects to be weighed are fed are disposed. The objects to be weighed<br>
which have been discharged from the discharge outlet 10ae of the lower chute 10a, the<br>
discharge outlet 10be of the lower chute 10b, and the discharge outlet 10ce of the lower<br>
chute 10c are fed into different inlets (first to third packaging machine inlets) and are<br>
charged into package bags for packaging. Thus, in the present example, the objects to<br>
be weighed which have been discharged from the collecting hopper 8a or 9a in the first<br>
combination weigher unit are fed into the first packaging machine inlet through the lower<br>
chute 10a, the objects to be weighed which have been discharged from the collecting<br>
hopper 8b or 9b in the second combination weigher unit are fed into the second<br><br>
41<br>
packaging machine inlet through the lower chute 10b, and the objects to be weighed<br>
which have been discharged from the collecting hopper 8c or 9c in the third combination<br>
weigher unit are fed into the third packaging machine inlet through the lower chute 10c.<br>
[0076] The control unit 20 (see Fig. 1(a)) is equipped, which controls an operation of<br>
the entire combination weigher of the present example and performs a combination<br>
process to determine a combination (discharge combination) made up of the weighing<br>
hoppers 4 and the memory hoppers 5 which will discharge the objects to be weighed for<br>
each of the first, second, and third combination weigher units. The combination process<br>
for each combination weigher unit is identical to that of the example 1.<br>
[0077] The other configuration is identical to that of the example 1 and will not be<br>
further described.<br>
[0078] In the example 2, each combination weigher unit may be configured to carry out<br>
the double shift operation and the triple shift operation as in the example 1.<br>
[0079] The timing charts of the first and second combination weigher units are similar<br>
to those of Fig. 2, for example, and the timing chart of the third combination weigher unit<br>
is similar to those of the first and second combination weigher units, in the configuration<br>
to cause the first, second and third combination weigher units to carry out the double<br>
shift operation.<br>
[0080] The timing charts of the first and second combination weigher units are similar<br>
to those of Fig. 3, for example, and the timing chart of the third combination weigher unit<br>
is similar to those of the first and second combination weigher units, in the configuration<br>
to cause the first, second and third combination weigher units to carry out the triple shift<br>
operation.<br>
[0081] The combination weigher of the example 2 differs from the combination<br>
weigher of the example 1 in the number of combination weigher units equipped, and is<br>
able to achieve advantages similar to those of the combination weigher of the example 1.<br>
[0082] Whereas the control unit 20 executes control to cause the first, second and third<br>
combination weigher units to operate at same timings as described above in the above<br><br>
42<br>
operation, as in the case of the example 1, it may alternatively execute control to cause<br>
the first, second and third combination weigher units to operate at different timings. In<br>
this case, for example, the control unit 20 may be configured to receive a feed command<br>
signal corresponding to the first combination weigher unit as an input, a feed command<br>
signal corresponding to the second combination weigher unit as an input, and a feed<br>
command signal corresponding to the third combination weigher unit as an input, from<br>
the packaging machine, and to control the operation of each combination weigher unit<br>
based on the associated feed command signal.<br>
[0083] As in the configuration of the example 1 in which the two combination weigher<br>
units are equipped and as in the configuration of the example 2 in which the three<br>
combination weigher units are equipped, four or more combination weigher units may be<br>
equipped.<br>
[0084] It should be noted that, whereas in the embodiment 1, each combination<br>
weigher unit is configured to carry out the double shift operation and the triple shift<br>
operation, it may be configured to carry out the single shift operation with a low<br>
operation speed (discharge speed), as a matter of course. When each combination<br>
weigher unit is configured to carry out the single shift operation, combination calculation<br>
is performed once within the one operation cycle time Tw, the combination hoppers 4<br>
and 5 perform the discharge operation once within the one operation cycle time Tw, and<br>
the collecting hoppers perform the discharge operation with respect to the packaging<br>
machine once within the one operation cycle time Tw. In this case, one discharge<br>
cycle time of the combination weigher is equal to the one operation cycle time Tw.<br>
[0085] (Embodiment 2)<br>
[Example a of embodiment 2]<br>
Fig. 5 (a) is a schematic partial cross-sectional view of a combination weigher<br>
(weighing system) according to an example a of an embodiment 2 of the present<br>
invention, as viewed from laterally, Fig. 5(b) is a schematic view of collecting chutes<br>
(inner chutes and outer chutes), weighing hoppers, and memory hoppers of the<br><br>
43<br>
combination weigher as viewed from above, and Fig. 5(c) is a schematic view of lower<br>
chutes of the combination weigher as viewed from above.<br>
[0086] As shown in Fig. 5(c), the combination weigher according to the example a of<br>
the present embodiment is configured in such a manner that two lower chutes 10a and<br>
10b are disposed below four collecting hoppers 8a, 8b, 9a and 9b, the collecting hoppers<br>
8a and 9b are provided with gates (not shown) to be able to discharge the objects to be<br>
weighed to the lower chute 10a, and the collecting hoppers 8b and 9a are provided with<br>
gates (not shown) to be able to discharge the objects to be weighed to the lower chute<br>
10b. The objects to be weighed which have been discharged to the lower chute 10a or<br>
10b are discharged from the associated discharge outlet 10ae or 10be, respectively. The<br>
other configuration is identical to that of the example 1 of the embodiment 1 shown in<br>
Fig. 1, and will not be further described. Nonetheless, in the example a of the present<br>
embodiment, the combination process performed by the control unit 20 and operation<br>
timings are different from those of the example 1 of the embodiment 1. In the example<br>
a, as in the example 1, the first combination weigher unit includes the weighing hoppers<br>
4 and the memory hoppers 5 in the group A, and the associated components<br>
corresponding to the group A, and the second combination weigher unit includes the<br>
weighing hoppers 4 and the memory hoppers 5 in the group B and the associated<br>
components corresponding to the group B.<br>
[0087] Below the lower chutes 10a and 10b of the combination weigher, two packaging<br>
machines (not shown) or a twin-inlet packaging machine (not shown) having two inlets<br>
into which the objects to be weighed are fed are disposed. The objects to be weighed<br>
which have been discharged from the discharge outlet 10ae of the lower chute 10a and<br>
the discharge outlet lObe of the lower chute 10b are respectively fed into the different<br>
packaging machine inlets (first and second packaging machine inlets) and are charged<br>
into package bags for packaging. Thus, in the present example, the objects to be<br>
weighed which have been discharged from the collecting hopper 8a in the first<br>
combination weigher unit and from the collecting hopper 9b in the second combination<br><br>
44<br>
weigher unit are fed into the first packaging machine inlet through the lower chute 10a,<br>
while the objects to be weighed which have been discharged from the collecting hopper<br>
9a in the first combination weigher unit and from the collecting hopper 8b in the second<br>
combination weigher unit are fed into the second packaging machine inlet through the<br>
lower chute 10b.<br>
[0088] The control unit 20 includes a control means and a combination calculation<br>
means for each combination weigher unit to control the operation of the entire<br>
combination weigher and to perform a combination process to determine a combination<br>
(discharge combination) made up of the weighing hoppers 4 and the memory hoppers 5<br>
which will discharge the objects to be weighed, for each of the first and second<br>
combination weigher units. In the combination process, the combination calculation is<br>
performed based on measured values (measured values obtained using the weight sensors<br>
41) of the weights of the objects to be weighed inside the weighing hoppers 4 and the<br>
memory hoppers 5 to select two combinations made up of the weighing hoppers 4 and<br>
the memory hoppers 5 in which a combination measured value (= combination weight<br>
value) which is a total of the measured values is within an allowable range<br>
(predetermined weight range) with respect to a target weight value and to determine them<br>
as discharge combinations. The measured values of the objects to be weighed inside the<br>
memory hoppers 5 for use in this combination process are measured values obtained<br>
using the weight sensors 41 in the weighing hoppers 4 located thereabove. The<br>
combination process will be described in detail.<br>
[0089] Hereinafter, the weighing hoppers 4 and the memory hoppers 5 are collectively<br>
referred to as combination hoppers 4 and 5 when they are not particularly distinguished<br>
from each other.<br>
[0090] An outline of the operation of the above configured combination weigher will<br>
be first described.<br>
[0091] The objects to be weighed are supplied from the external supplying device to<br>
the dispersion feeder 1. The dispersion feeder 1 feeds the objects to be weighed to the<br><br>
45<br>
feeding hopper 3 through the linear feeder 2. The feeding hopper 3 feeds the objects to<br>
be weighed to the weighing hopper 4. The weight sensor 41 measures the weight of the<br>
objects to be weighed which have been fed into the weighing hopper 4, and sends the<br>
measured value to the control unit 20. The objects to be weighed whose weight has<br>
been measured in the weighing hopper 4 are supplied to the memory hopper 5 located<br>
therebelow if the memory hopper 5 is empty. The control unit 20 performs the<br>
combination process to determine two discharge combinations simultaneously for each<br>
combination weigher unit. Then, the combination hoppers 4 and 5 selected to make up<br>
of the two discharge combinations in each combination weigher unit discharge the<br>
objects to be weighed. If the objects to be weighed are held in the weighing hopper 4<br>
located above the memory hopper 5 which is empty, the weighing hopper 4 feeds the<br>
objects to be weighed to the empty memory hopper 5. The feeding hopper 3 feeds the<br>
objects to be weighed to the empty weighing hopper 4. The linear feeder 2 feeds the<br>
objects to be weighed to the empty feeding hopper 3.<br>
[0092] In the above configuration, in each combination weigher unit, discharge<br>
directions in which the combination hoppers 4 and 5 making up of the two discharge<br>
combinations determined simultaneously in the combination process are made different.<br>
To be specific, in each combination weigher unit, the combination hoppers 4 and 5<br>
making up of one of the two discharge combinations are caused to discharge the objects<br>
to be weighed to the inner chute (6a or 6b) and simultaneously, the combination hoppers<br>
4 and 5 making up of the other discharge combination discharge the objects to be<br>
weighed to the outer chute (7a or 7b). In addition, the inner chute collecting hopper (8a<br>
or 8b) and the outer chute collecting hopper (9a or 9b) are caused to discharge the objects<br>
to be weighed simultaneously. For example, in the two discharge combinations of the<br>
first combination weigher unit, the weighing hopper 4 is selected to make up of the<br>
discharge combination for discharging the objects to be weighed to the inner chute 6a,<br>
only when the corresponding memory hopper 5 disposed therebelow is selected together.<br>
In this case, the weighing hopper 4 and the memory hopper 5 open their inner gates to<br><br>
46<br>
discharge the objects to be weighed in such a manner that the objects to be weighed are<br>
discharged from the weighing hopper 4 onto the inner chute 6a through inside of the<br>
memory hopper 5. To make up of the discharge combination for discharging the objects<br>
to be weighed to the inner chute 6a, the memory hopper 5 may be selected freely. To<br>
make up of the discharge combination for discharging the objects to be weighed to the<br>
outer chute 6a, the weighing hopper 4 and the memory hopper 5 may be selected freely.<br>
The same applies to the second combination weigher unit.<br>
[0093] Subsequently, the combination process of the present embodiment will be<br>
described in detail. Fig. 6 is a flowchart showing the combination process of an<br>
arbitrary combination weigher unit of the present embodiment. For the first and second<br>
combination weigher units, the combination process shown in steps S1 to S4 is<br>
performed.<br>
[0094] In step S1, combination calculation is performed using measured values of the<br>
objects to be weighed which have been fed to all the combination hoppers 4 and 5 in the<br>
arbitrary combination weigher unit to select combinations in which a combination<br>
measured value which is a total of measured values is within an allowable range with<br>
respect to a target weight value and to determine them as optimal combinations.<br>
[0095] In step S2, an optimal combination set (pair of optimal combinations) formed<br>
by combining two optimal combinations which include different combination hoppers 4<br>
and 5 is determined. In the present embodiment, if weighing hoppers 4 are selected to<br>
make up of both of the two optimal combinations to be combined and the memory<br>
hoppers 5 corresponding to the selected weighing hoppers 4 are not selected, the two<br>
optimal combinations are excluded from the optimal combination set (are not selected for<br>
the optimal combination set). Therefore, in cases where weighing hoppers 4 are<br>
included in the two optimal combinations composing the optimal combination set, the<br>
memory hopper 5 corresponding to the selected weighing hopper 4 is always selected to<br>
make up of at least one optimal combination.<br>
[0096] In step S3, for each optimal combination set, absolute values of differences<br><br>
47<br>
between combination measured values of respective optimal combinations composing<br>
the optimal combination set and a target weight value are calculated and a total of the<br>
absolute values of the differences is calculated. The absolute values of the differences<br>
between the combination measured values and the target weight value mean absolute<br>
values obtained by subtracting the target weight value from the combination measured<br>
values or by subtracting the combination measured values from the target value, and are<br>
zero or positive values.<br>
[0097] In step S4, one optimal combination set in which the total of the absolute values<br>
of the differences calculated in step S3 is smallest is selected, and one of the two optimal<br>
combinations composing the set is determined as the discharge combination (first<br>
discharge combination) for discharging the objects to be weighed to the inner chute (6a<br>
or 6b), and the other of the two optimal combinations is determined as the discharge<br>
combination (second discharge combination) for discharging the objects to be weighed to<br>
the outer chute (7a or 7b). If a weighing hopper 4 is selected to make up of one of the<br>
two optimal combinations composing the selected optimal combination set, and a<br>
memory hopper 5 corresponding to the selected weighing hopper 4 is not selected, the<br>
optimal combination is determined as the second discharge combination for discharging<br>
the objects to be weighed to the outer chute, and the other optimal combination is<br>
determined as the first discharge combination for discharging the objects to be weighed<br>
to the inner chute. If an optimal combination which includes a weighing hopper 4 but<br>
does not include a memory hopper 5 corresponding to the selected weighing hopper 4 is<br>
not included in a selected optimal combination set, any predetermined method may be<br>
employed to determine which of the two optimal combinations as the first discharge<br>
combination or the second discharge combination. For example, serial numbers may be<br>
assigned to the memory hoppers 5, an optimal combination including a memory hopper 5<br>
with a smallest number may be determined as the first discharge combination, and the<br>
other optimal combination may be determined as the second discharge combination, or<br>
vice versa. Alternatively, the first and second optimal combinations may be determined<br><br>
48<br>
according to the magnitude of the combination measured value. For example, an<br>
optimal combination with a larger combination measured value may be determined as the<br>
first combination and an optimal combination with a smaller combination measured<br>
value may be determined as the second combination, or vice versa. In a further<br>
alternative, the optimal combination with the larger combination measured value and the<br>
optimal combination with the smaller combination measured value may be alternately<br>
determined as the first and second discharge combinations, every time combination<br>
process is performed.<br>
[0098] Whereas in steps S3 and S4, for each optimal combination set, the total of the<br>
absolute values of the differences between the combination measured values of the<br>
respective optimal combinations and the target weight value is calculated, and the<br>
optimal combination set in which the total of the absolute values of the differences is<br>
smallest is selected to determine the two discharge combinations, the total of squares of<br>
the absolute values of the differences between the combination measured values of the<br>
respective optimal combinations and the target weight value, may be calculated, and an<br>
optimal combination set in which a total of the squares of the differences is smallest may<br>
be selected to determine it as two discharge combinations, for each optimal combination<br>
set.<br>
[0099] As described above, two discharge combinations are determined in one<br>
combination process. In the example a, as in the configuration to cause the<br>
combination weigher to carry out the double shift operation in the example 1 of the<br>
embodiment 1, by setting the number of weighing hoppers 4 and the number of memory<br>
hoppers 5 respectively to nine or ten in each of the groups A and B, and by setting the<br>
number of the combination hoppers 4 and 5 which would be selected in the combination<br>
process to make up of one optimal combination set in the combination process to four,<br>
high combination weighing precision is obtained.<br>
[0100] Fig. 7 is a timing chart showing the operation of the combination weigher<br>
according to the example a of the present embodiment.<br><br>
49<br>
[0101] One operation cycle time TW in each combination weigher unit is, for example,<br>
a time period taken to accomplish a procedure in which immediately after two discharge<br>
combinations have been determined in a combination process in a previous operation<br>
cycle, weighing hoppers 4 selected to make up of these two discharge combinations<br>
(when the weighing hoppers 4 are selected to make up of the discharge combinations)<br>
discharge the objects to be weighed, the objects to be weighed are subsequently fed to the<br>
weighing hoppers 4 making up of these discharge combinations, time for stabilizing the<br>
weight sensors 41 lapses, the weight sensors 41 measure the weights of the objects to be<br>
weighed inside these weighing hoppers 4, and thereafter next combination process is<br>
performed to determine two discharge combinations. One weighing cycle time is, for<br>
example, a time period taken to accomplish a procedure in which weighing hoppers 4<br>
selected to make up of two discharge combinations determined in a combination process<br>
in a previous operation cycle (when the weighing hoppers 4 are selected to make up of<br>
the discharge combinations), start to discharge the objects to be weighed, the objects to<br>
be weighed are subsequently fed to the weighing hoppers 4 making up of the two<br>
discharge combinations, time for stabilizing the weight sensors 41 lapses, the weight<br>
sensors 41 measures the weights of the objects to be weighed inside these weighing<br>
hoppers 4, and thereafter next combination process is performed to determine two<br>
discharge combinations. Therefore, one weighing cycle time is equal to one operation<br>
cycle time Tw in a case where an allowance time, a wait time, etc, which lapses from<br>
when two discharge combinations are determined in a combination process until hoppers<br>
selected to make up of the two discharge combinations start to discharge the objects to be<br>
weighed, is zero. It is desired that the operation cycle time Tw be equal to one<br>
weighing cycle time to carry out high-speed operation. Therefore, in present<br>
embodiment, the one operation cycle time Tw is equal to or substantially equal to one<br>
weighing cycle time.<br>
[0102] In the example a, the operation of the first combination weigher unit and the<br>
operation of the second combination weigher unit take place at timings with Tw/2 time<br><br>
50<br>
difference, but are similar. For each combination weight unit, a combination process is<br>
performed to determine two discharge combinations once in every Tw time and the<br>
combination hoppers 4 and 5 making up of the two discharge combinations determined in<br>
the combination process discharge the objects to be weighed simultaneously. In<br>
addition, the inner chute collecting hopper (8a or 8b) and the outer chute collecting<br>
hopper (9a or 9b) discharge the objects to be weighed simultaneously once in every Tw<br>
time. Thereby, in each combination weigher unit, the objects to be weighed making up<br>
of two discharge combinations are fed to the packaging machine within one operation<br>
cycle time Tw. In this case, one discharge cycle time Td3 in each combination weigher<br>
unit is equal to one operation cycle time Tw and is twice as long as one packaging cycle<br>
time Tp1 of the packaging machine.<br>
[0103] Receiving, for example, a feed command signal from the packaging machine, as<br>
an input, the control unit 20 causes the inner chute collecting hopper 8a and the outer<br>
chute collecting hopper 9a in the first combination weigher unit, for example, to open<br>
their gates simultaneously to discharge the objects to be weighed to the packaging<br>
machine, in response to the feed command signal (time t1). And, the control unit 20<br>
causes the combination hoppers 4 and 5 selected to make up of one of the discharge<br>
combinations to open their inner gates based on the operation timings of the gates of the<br>
collecting hoppers 8a and 9a to discharge the objects to be weighed to the inner chute 6a<br>
and causes the combination hoppers 4 and 5 selected to make up of the other discharge<br>
combination to open their outer gates based on the operation timings of the gates of the<br>
collecting hoppers 8a and 9a to discharge the objects to be weighed to the outer chute 7a<br>
(time tl). Receiving a subsequent feed command signal as an input, the control unit 20<br>
causes the inner chute collecting hopper 8b and the outer chute collecting hopper 9b in<br>
the second combination weigher unit to open their gates simultaneously to discharge the<br>
objects to be weighed to the packaging machine (time t2). And, the control unit 20<br>
causes the combination hoppers 4 and 5 selected to make up of one of the discharge<br>
combinations to open their inner gates based on the operation timings of the gates of the<br><br>
51<br>
collecting chutes 8b and 9b to discharge the objects to be weighed to the inner chute 6b<br>
and causes the combination hoppers 4 and 5 selected to make up of the other discharge<br>
combination to open their outer gates based on the operation timings of the gates of the<br>
collecting hoppers 8b and 9b to discharge the objects to be weighed to the outer chute 7b<br>
(time t2). The above operation is repeated every time the feed command signal is<br>
received as the input (time t3, time t4, time t5).<br>
[0104] In the operation shown in Fig. 7, the objects to be weighed which have been<br>
discharged from the combination hoppers 4 and 5 by opening the inner gates in the first<br>
combination weigher unit at time t1 are gathered to and held in the inner chute collecting<br>
hopper 8a before time t3, and the collecting hopper 8a opens its gate to feed the objects<br>
to be weighed in the collecting hopper 8a to the first packaging machine inlet through the<br>
lower chute 10a at time t3. Likewise, the objects to be weighed which have been<br>
discharged from the combination hoppers 4 and 5 by opening the outer gates in the first<br>
combination weigher unit at time tl are gathered to and held in the outer chute collecting<br>
hoppers 9a before time t3, and the collecting hopper 9a opens its gate to feed the objects<br>
to be weighed in the collecting hopper 9a to the second packaging machine inlet through<br>
the lower chute 10b at time t3.<br>
[0105] The objects to be weighed which have been discharged from the combination<br>
hoppers 4 and 5 by opening the inner gates in the second combination weigher unit at<br>
time t2 are gathered to and held in the inner chute collecting hopper 8b before time t4,<br>
and the collecting hopper 8b opens its gate to feed the objects to be weighed in the<br>
collecting hopper 8b to the second packaging machine inlet through the lower chute 10b<br>
at time t4. Likewise, the objects to be weighed which have been discharged from the<br>
combination hoppers 4 and 5 by opening the outer gates in the second combination<br>
weigher unit at time t2 are gathered to and held in the outer chute collecting hopper 9b<br>
before time t4, and the collecting hopper 9b opens its gate to feed the objects to be<br>
weighed in the collecting hopper 9b to the first packaging machine inlet through the<br>
lower chute 10a at time t4.<br><br>
52<br>
[0106] Whereas in the operation of Fig. 7, the opening and closing timings of the gates<br>
of the inner chute collecting hopper and the outer chute collecting hopper are the same as<br>
the opening and closing timings of the inner gate and the outer gate of the combination<br>
hoppers in each combination weigher unit, these are merely exemplary. For example,<br>
the control unit 20 may control the opening and closing timings of the inner gate and the<br>
outer gate of the combination hoppers based on the opening and closing timings of the<br>
gates of the collecting hoppers to make the opening and closing timings of the gates<br>
different between the collecting hoppers and the combination hoppers.<br>
[0107] By causing the two combination weigher units to operate in the manner as<br>
described above, the objects to be weighed are fed to each of the two packaging machine<br>
inlets once in every Tw/2 time. Therefore, the objects to be weighed are discharged<br>
twice to each of the two packaging machine inlets within the one operation cycle time<br>
Tw. As a result, productivity (total number of times the combination weigher discharge<br>
the objects to be weighed to the packaging machine) within a specified time period can<br>
be improved.<br>
[0108] In the example a of the present embodiment, each combination weigher unit is<br>
configured in such a mariner that the inner chute 6a or 6b is disposed to respectively<br>
correspond to the group A or B of the combination hoppers 4 and 5 arranged in a<br>
circular-arc shape (semi-circular shape in the example a) having a central angle of<br>
approximately 180 degrees or smaller, and the outer chute 7a or 7b is disposed along<br>
outside of the inner chute 6a or 6b, as in the example 1 of the embodiment 1. So, the<br>
collecting chutes (inner chute and outer chute) can be made to have a relatively simple<br>
structure, and the distance over which the objects to be weighed which have been<br>
discharged from the combination hoppers 4 and 5 to the inner chute 6a or 6b are<br>
transferred and the distance over which the objects to be weighed which have been<br>
discharged from the combination hoppers 4 and 5 to the outer chute 7a or 7b are<br>
transferred to the collecting hopper 9a or 9b can be made short and substantially equal.<br>
Irrespective of the characteristics of almost all objects to be weighed, all of the objects to<br><br>
53<br>
be weighed which have been discharged from the combination hoppers 4 and 5 can be<br>
gathered to the associated collecting hoppers 9a or 9b in a short time. Therefore, a<br>
structure of the collecting chutes can be made to have a relatively simple structure, and<br>
the combination weigher is able to operate at a high speed irrespective of the<br>
characteristics of almost all objects to be weighed. In addition, each combination<br>
weigher unit is able to select two combinations of the objects to be weighed and perform<br>
discharge operation of the two combinations within the one operation cycle time Tw<br>
without slowing the operation speed.<br>
[0109] Furthermore, since in the combination process (first combination process)<br>
shown in the flowchart of Fig. 6, an optimal combination set in which the total of the<br>
absolute values of the differences between the combination measured values of the<br>
respective optimal combinations and the target weight value is smallest is selected and<br>
the two optimal combinations composing the optimal combination set are determined as<br>
the discharge combinations, combination weighing precision for the discharged objects<br>
to be weighed can be improved as a whole.<br>
[0110] The first combination process shown in the flowchart of Fig. 6 may be replaced<br>
by a second combination process or a third combination process to be described below<br>
[0111] First, the second combination process will be described. Fig. 8 is a flowchart<br>
showing the combination process for an arbitrary combination weigher unit in the present<br>
embodiment. In the first and second combination weigher units, the combination<br>
process shown in steps S11 to S15 is performed.<br>
[0112] In step S11, combination calculation is performed using measured values of the<br>
objects to be weighed which have been fed to all the combination hoppers 4 and 5 in an<br>
arbitrary combination weigher unit to select combinations in which a combination<br>
measured value which is a total of the measured values is within an allowable range with<br>
respect to a target weight value and to determine them as allowable combinations. The<br>
process in step Sll is the same as the process of step S1 of Fig. 6, and the optimal<br>
combinations determined in step S1 correspond to the allowable combinations<br><br>
54<br>
determined in step S11.<br>
[0113] In step S12, predetermined m (m: plural number), for example ten allowable<br>
combinations are selected from all the allowable combinations by giving priority to those<br>
in which absolute values of difference between combination measured values and the<br>
target weight value are smaller, and the selected allowable combinations are determined<br>
as first optimal combinations.<br>
[0114] In step S13, one allowable combination is selected from allowable combinations<br>
made up of the combination hoppers 4 and 5 obtained by excluding the combination<br>
hoppers 4 and 5 making up of an arbitrary first optimal combination from all the<br>
combination hoppers 4 and 5 in the combination weigher unit, by giving priority to a<br>
combination in which an absolute value of a difference between a combination measured<br>
value and the target weight value is smaller, and the selected allowable combination is<br>
determined as a second optimal combination corresponding to the arbitrary first optimal<br>
combination. In the same manner, second optimal combinations respectively<br>
corresponding to m first optimal combinations are determined. In this manner, the<br>
second optimal combinations respectively corresponding to m first optimal combinations<br>
are determined, and m optimal combination sets each consisting of the associated first<br>
optimal combination and second optimal combination are determined. It should be<br>
noted that in the present embodiment, when weighing hoppers 4 are selected to make up<br>
of two combinations consisting of a first optimal combination and an allowable<br>
combination which is a candidate of the associated second optimal combination but<br>
memory hoppers 5 corresponding to the selected weighing hoppers 4 are not selected, the<br>
allowable combination is not selected as the second optimal combination. Therefore,<br>
when the weighing hoppers 4 are selected to make up of two optimal combinations<br>
composing an optimal combination set, the memory hopper 5 corresponding to the<br>
selected weighing hopper 4 is always selected to make up of at least one optimal<br>
combination.<br>
[0115] In step S14, for each optimal combination set, absolute values of differences<br><br>
55<br>
between combination measured values of the first and second optimal combinations<br>
composing the optimal combination set and the target weight value are calculated and a<br>
total of the absolute values of the differences is calculated.<br>
[0116] In step S15, one optimal combination set in which the total of the absolute<br>
values of the differences calculated in step S14 is smallest is selected, one of the two<br>
optimal combinations composing the optimal combination set is determined as a<br>
discharge combination (first discharge combination) for discharging the objects to be<br>
weighed to the inner chute (6a or 6b) and the other optimal combination is determined as<br>
the discharge combination (second discharge combination) for discharging the objects to<br>
be weighed to the outer chute (7a or 7b). If a weighing hopper 4 is selected to make up<br>
of one of the two optimal combinations composing the selected optimal combination set<br>
but a memory hopper 5 corresponding to the selected weighing hopper 4 is not selected,<br>
the optimal combination is determined as the second discharge combination for<br>
discharging the objects to be weighed to the outer chute and the other optimal<br>
combination is determined as the first discharge combination for discharging the objects<br>
to be weighed to the inner chute. If an optimal combination which includes a weighing<br>
hopper 4 but does not include a memory hopper 5 corresponding to the selected weighing<br>
hopper 4 is not included in a selected optimal combination set, any specified method may<br>
be employed to determine which of the two optimal combinations is the first discharge<br>
combination or the second discharge combination. For example, serial numbers may be<br>
assigned to the memory hoppers 5, an optimal combination including the memory hopper<br>
5 with a smallest number may be determined as the first discharge combination, and the<br>
other optimal combination may be determined as the second discharge combination, or<br>
vice versa. Alternatively, the first and second optimal combinations may be determined<br>
according to the magnitude of the combination measured values. For example, an<br>
optimal combination with a larger combination measured value may be determined as the<br>
first discharge combination and an optimal combination with a smaller combination<br>
measured value may be determined as the second discharge combination, or vice versa.<br><br>
56<br>
In a further alternative, the optimal combination with the larger combination measured<br>
value and the optimal combination with the smaller combination measured value may be<br>
alternately determined as the first and second discharge combinations, every time the<br>
combination process is performed.<br>
[0117] Whereas in steps S14 and S15, for each optimal combination set, the total of the<br>
absolute values of the differences between the combination measured values of the<br>
respective optimal combinations and the target weight value is calculated, and one<br>
optimal combination set in which the total of the absolute values of the differences is<br>
smallest is selected to determine it as the two discharge combinations, a total of squares<br>
of differences between the combination measured values of the respective optimal<br>
combinations and the target weight value, may be calculated, and one optimal<br>
combination set in which the total of the squares of the differences is smallest is selected<br>
to determine it as two discharge combinations, for each optimal combination set.<br>
[0118] Subsequently, the third combination process will be described. The third<br>
combination process is performed for the first and second combination weigher units as<br>
described below.<br>
[0119] In the third combination process, combination calculation is performed using<br>
measured values of the objects to be weighed which have been fed to all the combination<br>
hoppers 4 and 5 in an arbitrary combination weigher unit to select combinations in which<br>
a combination measured value which is a total of measured values is within an allowable<br>
range with respect to a target weight value and to determine them as allowable<br>
combinations. One allowable combination in which an absolute value of a difference<br>
between a combination measured value and the target weight value is smallest is selected<br>
from all the allowable combinations and is determined as the first optimal combination.<br>
[0120] Then, one allowable combination is selected from allowable combinations<br>
consisting of combinations made up of the combination hoppers 4 and 5 remaining after<br>
excluding the combination hoppers 4 and 5 making up of the first optimal combination<br>
from all the combination hoppers 4 and 5 in the combination weigher unit, by giving<br><br>
57<br>
priority to a combination in which an absolute value of a difference between a<br>
combination measured value and a target weight value is smaller, and the selected<br>
allowable combination is determined as a second optimal combination. It should be<br>
noted that in present embodiment, when weighing hoppers 4 are selected to make up of<br>
two combinations consisting of a first optimal combination and an allowable<br>
combination which is a candidate of the associated second optimal combination but a<br>
memory hopper 5 corresponding to the selected weighing hopper 4 is not selected, the<br>
allowable combination is not selected as the second optimal combination. Therefore,<br>
when the weighing hoppers 4 are selected to make up of both of first and second optimal<br>
combinations, the memory hopper 5 corresponding to the selected weighing hopper 4 is<br>
always selected to make up of at least one optimal combination.<br>
[0121] Then, one of the first and second optimal combinations is determined as the<br>
discharge combination (first discharge combination) for discharging the objects to be<br>
weighed to the inner chute and the other is determined as the discharge combination<br>
(second discharge combination) for discharging the objects to be weighed to the outer<br>
chute. If a weighing hopper 4 is selected to make up of one of the two optimal<br>
combinations but a memory hopper 5 corresponding to the selected weighing hopper 4 is<br>
not selected, the optimal combination is determined as the second discharge combination<br>
for discharging the objects to be weighed to the outer chute and the other optimal<br>
combination is determined as the first discharge combination for discharging the objects<br>
to be weighed to the inner chute. If the first optimal combination and the second<br>
optimal combination are not a combination which includes a weighing hopper 4 but does<br>
not include a memory hopper 5 corresponding to the selected weighing hopper 4, any<br>
specified method may be employed to determine which of the two optimal combinations<br>
is the first discharge combination or second discharge combination, as in the case of the<br>
second combination process.<br>
[0122] In cases where the allowable range with respect to the target weight value is set<br>
to not less than the target weight value, i.e., a lower limit value of the allowable range is<br><br>
58<br>
equal to the target weight value in the first, second, and third combination processes, an<br>
absolute value of a difference between a combination measured value of an optimal<br>
combination or an allowable combination and the target weight value is equal to a value<br>
(difference) obtained by subtracting the target weight value from the combination<br>
measured value. In this case, therefore, the operation in which the total of the absolute<br>
values of the differences between the combination measured values of the respective<br>
optimal combinations and the target weight value is calculated in step S3 in Fig. 6 and in<br>
step S14 in Fig. 8, is equivalent to the operation in which the total of the differences is<br>
calculated by subtracting the target weight value from the combination measured values<br>
of the respective optimal combinations.<br>
[0123] In cases where a lower limit value of the allowable range is equal to the target<br>
weight value, the steps S3 and S4 in Fig. 6 and the steps S14 and 15 in Fig. 8 may be<br>
replaced by steps in which a total of combination measured values of two optimal<br>
combinations composing each optimal combination set is calculated, one optimal<br>
combination set in which the calculated total is smallest may be selected, and two<br>
optimal combinations composing the optimal combination set may be determined as first<br>
and second discharge combinations. In this case, also, two discharge combinations<br>
which are the same as those resulting from the steps S3 and S4 and the steps S14 and S15<br>
are determined.<br>
[0124] Since the above described first, second or third combination process is<br>
performed for each combination weigher unit to determine the two discharge<br>
combinations which will discharge the objects to be weighed once in every one operation<br>
cycle time Tw, weights of the objects to be weighed inside of all the combination<br>
hoppers 4 and 5 within each combination weigher unit can be used in the combination<br>
calculation for determining the two discharge combinations. As a result, combination<br>
weighing precision for the objects to be weighed which are discharged can be improved<br>
as a whole.<br>
[0125] In the second combination process, a plurality of first optimal combinations are<br><br>
59<br>
determined under an extended selection condition for the first optimal combination, the<br>
second optimal combinations respectively corresponding to the first optimal<br>
combinations are determined, and the two optimal combinations in which the total of<br>
combination measured values is smallest are selected from among them, in the third<br>
combination process. This means that the use of the second combination process can<br>
improve as a whole combination weighing precision for the objects to be weighed which<br>
are discharged rather than the use of the third combination process. Furthermore, since<br>
the optimal combination set in which the total of the absolute values of the differences<br>
between the combination measured values of the two optimal combinations and the target<br>
weight value is smallest is selected from the optimal combination sets each of which is<br>
formed by combining two optimal combinations selected from all the optimal<br>
combinations, combination weighing precision for the objects to be weighed which are<br>
discharged can be further improved as a whole.<br>
[0126] In addition, the calculation amount decreases in the order of the first<br>
combination process, the second combination process, and the third combination process,<br>
and time taken for the combination processes can be decreased in this order.<br>
[0127] Whereas in the example a, the collecting hopper 8a and the collecting hopper<br>
9b are configured to discharge the objects to be weighed to the lower chute 10a and the<br>
collecting hopper 9a and the collecting hopper 8b are configured to discharge the objects<br>
to be weighed to the lower chute 10b, one of the collecting hopper 8a and the collecting<br>
hopper 9a in the first combination weigher unit may be configured to discharge the<br>
objects to be weighed to the lower chute 10a, the other collecting hopper 8a or 9a may be<br>
configured to discharge the objects to be weighed to the lower chute 10b, one of the<br>
collecting hopper 8b and the collecting hopper 9b in the second combination weigher<br>
unit may be configured to discharge the objects to be weighed to the lower chute 10a and<br>
the other collecting hopper 8b or 9b may be configured to discharge the objects to be<br>
weighed to the lower chute 10b.<br>
[0128] [Example b of embodiment 2]<br><br>
60<br>
Fig. 9 (a) is a schematic view of collecting chutes (inner chutes and outer<br>
chutes), weighing hoppers and memory hoppers of a combination weigher (weighing<br>
system) according to an example b of the embodiment 2 of the present invention, as<br>
viewed from above, and Fig. 9(b) is a schematic view of a lower chute of the<br>
combination weigher as viewed from above.<br>
[0129] Whereas in the example a shown in Fig. 5, two combination weigher units are<br>
equipped, four combination weigher units are equipped in the present example. In the<br>
present example, as in the example a, the center body 11, the dispersion feeder 1, the<br>
linear feeders 2, the feeding hoppers 3, the weighing hoppers 4 attached with the weight<br>
sensors 41, and the memory hoppers 5, are equipped as shown in Fig. 5(a), and are<br>
identical in configuration to those of the example a. Therefore, explanation therefor is<br>
omitted.<br>
[0130] In the example b, all the weighing hoppers 4 and memory hoppers 5 are divided<br>
into four groups A, B, C, and D and combination weigher units are equipped to<br>
respectively include the four groups A, B, C, and D and to respectively correspond to the<br>
groups A, B, C, and D. So, four inner chutes 6a, 6b, 6c, and 6d are provided to<br>
respectively correspond to the four groups A, B, C and D, Collecting hoppers 8a. 8b. 8c.<br>
and 8d are respectively provided at bottom part discharge outlets 6ae, 6be, 6ce and 6de of<br>
the inner chutes 6a, 6b, 6c, and 6d to hold and discharge the objects to be weighed.<br>
Four outer chutes 7a, 7b, 7c and 7d are provided to respectively correspond to the four<br>
groups A, B, C, and D. Collecting hoppers 9a, 9b, 9c and 9d are respectively provided<br>
at bottom part discharge outlets 7ae, 7be, 7ce, and 7de of the outer chutes 7a, 7b, 7c, and<br>
7d to hold and discharge the objects to be weighed. Hereinafter, a combination weigher<br>
unit including the group A is referred to as a first combination weigher unit, a<br>
combination weigher unit including the group B is referred to as a second combination<br>
weigher unit, a combination weigher unit including the group C is referred to as a third<br>
combination weigher unit, and a combination weigher unit including the group D will be<br>
referred to as a fourth combination weigher unit.<br><br>
61<br>
[0131] Below the collecting hopper 9a of the first combination weigher unit and the<br>
collecting hopper 9b of the second combination weigher unit, the lower chute 10a is<br>
provided, and the objects to be weighed which have been discharged from the collecting<br>
hoppers 9a or 9b are discharged from the discharge outlet 10ae through the lower chute<br>
10a. Below the collecting hopper 8a of the first combination weigher unit and the<br>
collecting hopper 8b of the second combination weigher unit, the lower chute 10b is<br>
provided, and the objects to be weighed which have been discharged from the collecting<br>
hoppers 8a and 8b are discharged from the discharge outlet 10be through the lower chute<br>
10b. Below the collecting hopper 8c of the third combination weigher unit and the<br>
collecting hopper 8d of the fourth combination weigher unit, the lower chute 10c is<br>
provided, and the objects to be weighed which have been discharged from the collecting<br>
hoppers 8c and 8d are discharged from the discharge outlet 10ce through the lower chute<br>
10c. Below the collecting hopper 9c of the third combination weigher unit and the<br>
collecting hopper 9d of the fourth combination weigher unit, the lower chute 10d is<br>
provided, and the objects to be weighed which have been discharged from the collecting<br>
hoppers 9c and 9d are discharged from the discharge outlet 10de through the lower chute<br>
10d.<br>
[0132] Below the lower chutes 10a, 10b, 10c and 10d of the combination weigher, four<br>
packaging machines (not shown) or a packaging machine (not shown) having four inlets<br>
into which the objects to be weighed are fed are disposed. The objects to be weighed<br>
which have been discharged from the discharge outlet 10ae of the lower chute 10a, the<br>
discharge outlet 10be of the lower chute 10b, the discharge outlet 10ce of the lower chute<br>
10c, and the discharge outlet 10de of the lower chute 10d are respectively fed into the<br>
different packaging machine inlets (first to fourth packaging machine inlets) and are<br>
charged into package bags for packaging. Thus, in the present example, the objects to<br>
be weighed which have been discharged from the collecting hopper 9a in the first<br>
combination weigher unit and the collecting hopper 9b in the second combination<br>
weigher unit are fed into the first packaging machine inlet through the lower chute 10a,<br><br>
62<br>
and the objects to be weighed which have been discharged from the collecting hopper 8a<br>
in the first combination weigher unit and the collecting hopper 8b in the second<br>
combination weigher unit are fed into the second packaging machine inlet through the<br>
lower chute 10b. Also, the objects to be weighed which have been discharged from the<br>
collecting hopper 8c in the third combination weigher unit and from the collecting<br>
hopper 8d in the fourth combination weigher unit are fed into the third packaging<br>
machine inlet through the lower chute 10c, and the objects to be weighed which have<br>
been discharged from the collecting hopper 9c in the third combination weigher unit and<br>
from the collecting hopper 9d in the fourth combination weigher unit are fed into the<br>
fourth packaging machine inlet through the lower chute 10d<br>
[0133] The control unit 20 (see Fig. 5(a)) is equipped to control an operation of the<br>
entire combination weigher of the present example and to perform a combination process<br>
to determine a combination (discharge combination) made up of the weighing hoppers 4<br>
and the memory hoppers 5 which will discharge the objects to be weighed for each of the<br>
first, second, third and fourth combination weigher units. The combination process for<br>
each combination weigher unit is identical to that of the example a.<br>
[0134] The other configuration is identical to that of the example a and will not be<br>
further described. In the present example b, as in the example a, by setting the number<br>
of the weighing hoppers 4 and the memory hoppers 5 to nine or ten in each of the groups<br>
A, B, C, and D and by setting the number of weighing hoppers 4 and memory hoppers 5<br>
which would be selected to form one optimal combination in the combination process to<br>
four, high combination weighing precision is obtained.<br>
[0135] In the example b, operation timings are taken for each pair of two combination<br>
weigher units arranged adjacent each other. In the present example, the first<br>
combination weigher unit and the second combination weigher unit form a pair and the<br>
third combination weigher unit and the fourth combination weigher unit form a pair.<br>
[0136] The timing charts for the first combination weigher unit and the second<br>
combination weigher unit are similar to those of, for example, Fig. 7, and the timing<br><br>
63<br>
charts for the third combination weigher unit and the fourth combination weigher unit are<br>
similar to those for the first combination weigher unit and the second combination<br>
weigher unit. That is, the pair of the first and second combination weigher units and the<br>
pair of the third and fourth combination weigher units in the present example may be<br>
configured to operate as in the first and second combination weigher units in the example<br>
a, and description therefor will be omitted. It should be noted that the pair of the first<br>
and second combination weigher units and the pair of the third and fourth combination<br>
weigher units in the present example may be controlled based on different feed command<br>
signals. That is, it is necessary to set Tw/2 time difference between the operation<br>
timings for the two combination weigher units forming each pair as shown in Fig. 7, but<br>
any special correlation need not be made between the operation timings for the two pairs.<br>
[0137] The combination weigher according to the example b is identical to the<br>
combination weigher according to the example a except for the number of pairs of the<br>
combination weigher units, and is able to achieve advantages similar to those of the<br>
combination weigher of the example a.<br>
[0138] In the example a, the configuration in which the two combination weigher<br>
units(one pair of combination weigher units) are equipped, and in the example b. the<br>
configuration in which the four combination weigher units(two pairs of combination<br>
weigher units) are equipped. In the same manner, combination weigher units of even<br>
number which is six or more (three or more pairs of combination weigher units) may be<br>
equipped.<br>
[Example c of Embodiment 2]<br>
A combination weigher (weighing system) according to an example c of the<br>
embodiment 2 of the present invention is configured in such a manner that the two<br>
lower chutes 10a and 10b are omitted from the example a shown in Fig. 5 and the<br>
four collecting hoppers 8a, 8b, 9a, and 9b are respectively able to discharge the<br>
objects to be weighed in the same direction, for example, in a straight-downward<br>
direction. The other configuration is identical to that of the example a and will not<br><br>
64<br>
be described. Hereinafter, description will be given with reference to Fig. 5 (in the<br>
example c, the lower chutes 10a and 10b are omitted as described above).<br>
In the example c, a first combination weigher unit including the group A<br>
consisting of the weighing hoppers 4 and the memory hoppers 5 and a second<br>
combination weigher unit including the group B consisting of the weighing hoppers 4<br>
and the memory hoppers 5 are configured to operate at the same timings and the four<br>
collecting hoppers 8a, 8b, 9a, and 9b are configured to discharge the objects to be<br>
weighed simultaneously. As in the example a, for the first and second combination<br>
weigher units, the first combination process, the second combination process, or the<br>
third combination process is performed to determine two discharge combinations<br>
simultaneously.<br>
Fig. 10 is a timing chart showing the operation of the combination weigher<br>
according to the example c.<br>
[0139] Whereas in the example a, the first combination weigher unit and the<br>
second combination weigher unit operate with a time difference of Tvv/2 time as<br>
shown in Fig. 7, they operate at the same timings in the example c. In this case, one<br>
discharge cycle time Td3 for each combination weigher unit is equal to one operation<br>
cycle time Tw. The one discharge cycle time Td3 is equal to one packaging cycle<br>
time Tp3 for the packaging machine.<br>
[0140] A combination process for determining two discharge combinations<br>
simultaneously is performed once in every Tw time for each combination weigher<br>
unit, and the combination hoppers 4 and 5 making up of the two discharge<br>
combinations determined in the combination process discharge the objects to be<br>
weighed simultaneously once in every Tw time in each combination weigher unit.<br>
In addition, in each combination weigher unit, the inner chute collecting hopper (8a<br>
or 8b) and the outer chute collecting chopper (9a or 9b) discharge the objects to be<br>
weighed simultaneously once in every Tw time. The operation of each combination<br>
weigher unit is similar to that of the example a and will not be further described in<br><br>
65<br>
detail.<br>
Below the combination weigher, four packaging machines (not shown) or a<br>
packaging machine having four inlets (not shown) into which the objects to be<br>
weighed are fed are disposed. The objects to be weighed which have been<br>
discharged simultaneously from the four collecting hoppers 8a, 8b, 9a, and 9b are fed<br>
into different packaging machine inlets (first to fourth packaging machine inlets) and<br>
are packaged in the packaging machine(s).<br>
The combination weigher according to the example c is identical to the<br>
combination weigher according to the example a except for timings when the<br>
combination weigher units operate and the packaging machine inlets toward which the<br>
objects to be weighed are discharged, and is able to achieve advantages similar to those<br>
of the combination weigher of the example a.<br>
By causing the two combination weigher units to operate at the same timings as<br>
in the example c, the objects to be weighed are fed into each of the four packaging<br>
machine inlets once in every Tw time. Since the objects to be weighed are discharged<br>
once to each of the four packaging machine inlets within the one operation cycle time Tw,<br>
productivity within a specified time period can be improved.<br>
One example of the packaging machine having the four packaging machine<br>
inlets is shown in Fig. 11. Fig. 11 (a) is a schematic cross-sectional view showing a<br>
vacuum packaging machine and Fig. ll(b) is a schematic plan view of the packaging<br>
machine as viewed from above.<br>
In the packaging machine, funnels 51 are respectively disposed under the four<br>
collecting hoppers 8a, 8b, 9a, and 9b of the combination weigher. In this case, the<br>
funnels 51 are packaging machine inlets. It should be noted that openings of package<br>
bags or package containers manufactured or used in the packaging machine are<br>
packaging machine inlets into which the objects to be weighed are fed, depending on the<br>
type of the packaging machine.<br>
[0141] In the packaging machine, first, a forming part 52 suctions and heats a<br><br>
66<br>
resin-made film drawn from a roll to manufacture four package containers 55<br>
simultaneously. The resin-made film forming the package containers 55 is held by a<br>
conveyor means such as a belt conveyor which is not shown and is conveyed<br>
intermittently in a direction indicated by an arrow 56. Receiving, for example, a feed<br>
command signal from the packaging machine as an input, the combination weigher<br>
discharges the objects to be weighed simultaneously from the four collecting hoppers 8a,<br>
8b, 9a, and 9b. The objects to be weighed are fed to the package containers 55 through<br>
the associated funnels 51. Receiving, for example, a discharge completion signal, from<br>
the combination weigher, and being ready for conveying the resin-made firm, the<br>
packaging machine conveys subsequent four package containers 55 to under the four<br>
funnels 51 and stops. The packaging machine sends a feed command signal to the<br>
combination weigher. Thereby, the four package containers 55 are fed with the objects<br>
to be weighed simultaneously, and then are conveyed to a lid seal part 53. In the lid<br>
sealing part 53, a resin-made film is bonded to upper surfaces of the package containers<br>
55 to close the openings of the package containers 55. Thereafter, in a cutting part (not<br>
shown) positioned in a subsequent stage of the lid seal part 53, the resin-made film is cut<br>
for each package container 55 or each set of four package containers 55.<br>
Another example of the packaging machine adapted to the combination weigher<br>
according to the example c, may be a package bag supply type packaging machine<br>
configured in such a manner that separate four package bags are conveyed to locations<br>
under the four collecting hoppers 8a, 8b, 9a, and 9b simultaneously, the objects to be<br>
weighed which have been discharged from these collecting hoppers are fed into openings<br>
of the package bags through funnels or the like, and thereafter the openings of the<br>
package bags are sealed. Still another example of the packaging machine may be<br>
configured in such a manner that one or two resin-made films are drawn out from a roll<br>
and is subjected to heat treatment and pressurization treatment so that four package bags<br>
connected to each other are manufactured simultaneously, these package bags are<br>
transported to locations under the collecting hoppers 8a, 8b, 9a, and 9b, objects to be<br><br>
67<br>
weighed which have been discharged from these collecting hoppers are fed into openings<br>
of the package bags through funnels and the like, thereafter, the openings of the package<br>
bags are sealed, and the resin-made films are separated by cutting for each package bag.<br>
A still another example of the packaging machine may be a packaging line configured in<br>
such a manner that each set of four resin-made package containers manufactured in<br>
advance (e.g., package containers which are formed by separating the package containers<br>
55 in Fig. 11) are sequentially put on a belt conveyor and are transported to locations<br>
under the four collecting hoppers 8a, 8b, 9a, and 9b, and the openings of the package<br>
containers are closed by the resin-made film or the like after the combination weigher<br>
feeds the objects to be weighed to the four package containers simultaneously.<br>
[0142] In cases where the conventional combination weigher shown in, for example,<br>
Fig. 13 is used to discharge four sets of the objects to be weighed as in the example c, the<br>
following configurations (1) to (3) may be employed.<br>
[0143] (1) Four combination weighers are configured to operate at the same operation<br>
timings so that each combination weigher discharge one set of objects to be weighed,<br>
thus discharging four sets of objects to be weighed simultaneously.<br>
[0144] (2) Two combination weighers and a sorting discharge apparatus are used, and<br>
the two combination weighers are configured to operate at the same timings and carry out<br>
the double shift operation. In this case, each combination weigher discharges one set of<br>
objects to be weighed once in every 1/2 of one operation cycle time Tw. Therefore, two<br>
sets of objects to be weighed are discharged from the whole of the two combination<br>
weighers once in every Tw/2 time, and four sets of objects to be weighed are discharged<br>
therefrom within Tw time. In this case, the sorting discharge apparatus is required to<br>
individually receive the four sets of objects to be weighed which are discharged within<br>
Tw time and to discharge them to the packaging machine simultaneously. For example,<br>
four discharge hoppers (first to fourth discharge hoppers) are arranged in a straight line<br>
shape under collecting hoppers 13 (Fig. 13) of the two combination weighers, and the<br>
sorting discharge apparatus is constituted by the two collecting hoppers 13 and the four<br><br>
68<br>
discharge hoppers. One of the two collecting hoppers 13 is configured to be able to<br>
discharge the objects to be weighed to the first discharge hopper and to the second<br>
discharge hopper alternately, while the other collecting hopper 13 is configured to be able<br>
to discharge the objects to be weighed to the third discharge hopper and to the fourth<br>
discharge hopper alternately. The four discharge hoppers are configured to discharge<br>
the objects to be weighed to the packaging machine simultaneously, when these four<br>
discharge hoppers hold the objects to be weighed.<br>
(3) One combination weigher and one sorting apparatus are used.<br>
Combination calculation is performed once in every Tw/4 time. Weighing hoppers 4<br>
making up of a combination selected in the combination calculation discharge the objects<br>
to be weighed, and according to the discharge, the collecting hopper 13 discharges the<br>
objects to be weighed (hereinafter this operation is referred to as "fourth shift operation").<br>
In this case, one set of objects to be weighed are discharged from the combination<br>
weigher once in every Tw/4 time, and therefore four sets of objects to be weighed are<br>
discharged within Tw time. In this case, also, the sorting discharge apparatus is<br>
required to individually receive four sets of objects to be weighed which are discharged<br>
within Tw time and to discharge them to the packaging machine simultaneously, as in the<br>
above (2) case, although its configuration is different. To form the sorting discharge<br>
apparatus used in this case, for example, the sorting discharge apparatus described in the<br>
above (2) case may be altered to have two stages.<br>
In the configuration of the above (1) case, because of the need for the four<br>
combination weighers, equipment cost increases. In the configuration of the above (2)<br>
case, because of the need for the two combination weighers and the expensive sorting<br>
discharge apparatus, equipment const increases. In the configuration of the above (3)<br>
case, because of the need for the sorting discharge apparatus which has a more complex<br>
structure and is more expensive than in the above (2) case, equipment const increases.<br>
Furthermore, the double shift operation in the configuration of the above (2) case and the<br>
fourth shift operation in the configuration of the above (4) case may arise a problem that,<br><br>
69<br>
since each combination weigher has only one collecting chute 12 (Fig. 13), a distance<br>
between the batches of the objects to be weighed which are discharged from the<br>
weighing hoppers 4 selected in a previous combination onto the collecting chute 12 and<br>
the objects to be weighed which are discharged from the weighing hoppers 4 selected in a<br>
subsequent combination onto the collecting chute 12 becomes insufficiently large,<br>
depending on characteristics of the objects to be weighed, making high-speed operation<br>
difficult.<br>
[0145] In contrast to these configurations, the combination weigher of the example c, is<br>
able to operate at a high speed irrespective of characteristics of almost all the objects to<br>
be weighed and without substantially increasing equipment cost.<br>
[0146] Whereas in the configuration c, the combination weigher equipped with the two<br>
combination weigher units has been described, it may alternatively be equipped with<br>
three or more combination weigher units in the same manner. For example, in cases<br>
where the combination weigher is equipped with three combination weigher units, six<br>
collecting hoppers 8a, 8b, 8c, 9a, 9b, and 9c are equipped as shown in Fig. 4(a) to<br>
discharge the objects to be weighed simultaneously from the six collecting hoppers. In<br>
this case, in the packaging machine, for example, in the packaging machine shown in Fig.<br>
11, six package containers 55 are manufactured simultaneously and are conveyed, and<br>
the objects to be weighed are fed to the package containers 55 through the associated<br>
funnels 51. In this case, since the six collecting hoppers are not aligned as shown in Fig.<br>
4(a), the six funnels 51 are shape-changed to be able to guide the objects to be weighed<br>
to the six package containers 55 which are aligned. For example, the funnels 51 may be<br>
shape-changed in such a manner that an upper part receiver opening of each funnel 51 is<br>
located under the associated collecting hopper, and a pipe portion forming a lower part of<br>
the funnel 51 is made slightly longer so that a lower end of the pipe portion is located<br>
immediately above the associated package container 55.<br>
Whereas in the first and second embodiments, the weighing hoppers 4 and the<br>
memory hoppers 5 arranged in a circular shape are divided into a plurality of groups and<br><br>
70<br>
one combination weigher is equipped with combination weigher units respectively<br>
corresponding to the plurality of groups, a combination weigher (circular-arc shaped<br>
combination weigher) consisting of a combination weigher unit corresponding to one<br>
group may be used, for example. One example of this is a combination weigher which<br>
includes the dispersion feeder 1, the first combination weigher unit corresponding to the<br>
group A and the lower chute 10a in the configuration 1 shown in Fig. 1 and is configured<br>
to carry out the double shift operation or the triple shift operation. In this case, the<br>
feeding hoppers 3, the weighing hoppers 4 and the memory hoppers 5 are arranged in a<br>
semi-circular shape, and according to the shape, the linear feeder 2 is disposed.<br>
Therefore, the shape of the dispersion feeder 1 for feeding the objects to be weighed to<br>
the linear feeder 2 is changed. In this case, the combination weigher is configured<br>
substantially in a semi-circular shape (sector form having a central angle of<br>
approximately 180 degrees) as viewed from above. Likewise, a combination weigher<br>
which includes the dispersion feeder 1, the first combination weigher unit corresponding<br>
to the group A and the lower chute 10a in the configuration 2 shown in Fig. 4 and is<br>
configured to carry out the double shift operation or the triple operation, may be shaped<br>
in a sector form having a central angle of approximately 120 degrees as viewed from<br>
above. The objects to be weighed which have been discharged from these combination<br>
weighers having the sector form are fed into one package machine inlet through the<br>
lower chute 10a. Also, the lower chute 10a may be omitted from the above<br>
configuration and the objects to be weighed which have been discharged from the two<br>
collecting hoppers 8a and 9a (e.g., see Fig. 1) of the first combination weigher unit may<br>
be fed into different two packaging machine inlets. In the above configuration, the<br>
double shift operation or the triple shift operation may be replaced by any of the first,<br>
second, and third combinations processes and the operation described in the embodiment<br>
2, and the objects to be weighed which have been discharged from the two collecting<br>
hoppers 8a and 9a (e.g., see Fig. 1) of the first combination weigher unit may be fed into<br>
two different packaging machine inlets without providing the lower chute 10a. The<br><br>
71<br>
above described combination weigher is equipped with only the combination weigher<br>
unit corresponding to one group (e.g., group A in Fig. 1, group A in Fig. 4, or group A in<br>
Fig. 9, etc) made up of the combination hoppers 4 and 5 and is configured in such a<br>
manner that the feeding hoppers 3, the weighing hoppers 4, and the memory hoppers 5<br>
are arranged in a circular-arc shape having a central angle of approximately 180 degrees<br>
or smaller.<br>
[0147] In the examples of the embodiments 1 and 2, and the above described<br>
circular-arc shaped combination weigher, required lower chutes (10a, 10b, 10c, and lOd)<br>
may be equipped in the packaging machine.<br>
[0148] Whereas in the examples of the embodiments 1 and 2, and the above described<br>
circular-arc shaped combination weigher, the weighing hoppers 4 and the memory<br>
hoppers 5 located obliquely therebelow are illustrated as the combination hoppers fed<br>
with the objects to be weighed whose measured values are used in the combination<br>
calculation, these combination hoppers are merely exemplary. Figs. 12(a), 12(b), and<br>
12(c) are plan views schematically showing hoppers such as combination hoppers<br>
according to another examples. In Figs. 12(a), 12(b), and 12(c), an inner chute 6X<br>
corresponds to the inner chutes 6a and 6b and others in Figs. 1 and 5 and the ouier chute<br>
7X corresponds to the outer chutes 7a and 7b and others in Figs. 1 and 5. Each<br>
weighing hopper 4 shown in Figs. 12(a), 12(b), and 12(c) is attached with one weight<br>
sensor 41 (see Figs. 1 and 5).<br>
[0149] For example, as shown in Fig. 12(a), each weighing hopper 4 may be<br>
configured to have two chambers (weighing chambers) 4a and 4b which are respectively<br>
fed with the objects to be weighed and a memory hopper 5 having two chambers<br>
(accommodating chambers) 5a and 5b respectively corresponding to the weighing<br>
chambers 4a and 4b of the weighing hopper 4 may be provided obliquely below each<br>
weighing hopper 4. The two weighing chambers 4a and 4b of each weighing hopper 4<br>
may be arranged side by side substantially in the same direction as the direction in which<br>
the plurality of weighing hoppers 4 are arranged, and the two accommodating chambers<br><br>
72<br>
5a and 5b of each memory hopper 5 may be arranged side by side substantially in the<br>
same direction as the direction in which the plurality of memory hoppers 5 are arranged.<br>
In this case, the feeding hopper 3 is configured to be able to discharge the objects to be<br>
weighed selectively to the weighing chamber 4a or to the weighing hopper 4b of the<br>
weighing hopper 4. The weighing chamber 4a of the weighing hopper 4 is configured<br>
to be able to discharge the objects to be weighed selectively to the accommodating<br>
chamber 5a of the memory hopper 5 or to the outer chute 7X, while the weighing<br>
chamber 4b of the weighing hopper 4 is configured to be able to discharge the objects to<br>
be weighed selectively to the accommodating chamber 5b of the memory hopper 5 or to<br>
the outer chute 7X. The two accommodating chambers 5a and 5b of the memory<br>
hopper 5 are each configured to be able to discharge the objects to be weighed selectively<br>
to the inner chute 6A or to the outer chute 7X. The combination calculation is<br>
performed using weights (measured values) of the objects to be weighed inside the<br>
weighing chambers 4a and 4b of each weighing hopper 4 and weights (measured values)<br>
of the objects to be weighed inside the accommodating chambers 5a an 5b of each<br>
memory hopper 5, and the weighing chambers 4a and 4b and the accommodating<br>
chambers 5a and 5b are candidates io be selecied io make up of a discharge combination.<br>
In each weighing hopper 4, when one weighing chamber, for example, weighing chamber<br>
4a holds the objects to be weighed, the weight sensor 41 measures the weight of the<br>
objects to be weighed inside the weighing chamber 4a. Then, when the other weighing<br>
chamber 4b is fed with the objects to be weighed, the weight sensor 41 measures a total<br>
weight of the objects to be weighed inside the two weighing chambers 4a and 4b. The<br>
control unit 20 (see Figs. 1 and 5) calculates the weight (measured value) of the objects<br>
to be weighed inside the weighing chamber 4b by subtracting the weight of the objects to<br>
be weighed inside the weighing chamber 4a from the total weight of the objects to be<br>
weighed inside the two weighing chambers 4a and 4b. As the measured values of the<br>
objects to be weighed inside the accommodating chambers 5a and 5b, measured values<br>
obtained by measurement and calculation in the weighing chambers 4a and 4b of the<br><br>
73<br>
weighing hopper located thereabove are used. In this case, if the weighing chamber 4a<br>
or 4b is selected to make up of a discharge combination for discharging the objects to be<br>
weighed to the inner chute 6X, the corresponding accommodating chamber 5a or 5b is<br>
selected simultaneously. For example, when the corresponding weighing chamber 4a<br>
and accommodating chamber 5a are selected simultaneously, the objects to be weighed<br>
inside the weighing chamber 4a are discharged to the inner chute 6X through the<br>
accommodating chamber 5a.<br>
[0150] As shown in Fig. 12(b), each weighing hopper 4 may be configured to have<br>
two weighing chambers 4a and 4b without providing the memory hopper 5. The two<br>
weighing chambers 4a and 4b of each weighing hopper 4 may be arranged side by side<br>
substantially in the same direction as the direction in which the plurality of weighing<br>
hoppers 4 are arranged. In this case, the feeding hopper 3 is configured to be able to<br>
discharge the objects to be weighed selectively to the weighing chamber 4a or to the<br>
weighing hopper 4b of the weighing hopper 4. The two weighing chambers 4a and 4b<br>
of the weighing hopper 4 may be configured to be able to discharge the objects to be<br>
weighed selectively to the inner chute 6A or to the outer chute 7X. The combination<br>
calculation is performed using ihe weights (measured values) of the objects to be<br>
weighed inside the weighing chambers 4a and 4b of each weighing hopper 4 and the<br>
weighing chambers 4a and 4b are candidates to be selected to make up of a discharge<br>
combination. The weights of the objects to be weighed inside the weighing chambers<br>
4a and 4b are calculated in the same manner as that of Fig. 12(a).<br>
[0151] As shown in Fig. 12(c), each memory hopper 5 may be configured to have two<br>
accommodating chambers 5a and 5b. The two accommodating chambers 5a and 5b of<br>
each memory hopper 5 may be arranged side by side substantially in the same direction<br>
as the direction in which the plurality of memory hoppers 5 are arranged. Herein, the<br>
feeding hopper 3 (see Figs. 1 and 5) for feeding the objects to be weighed to the<br>
weighing hopper 4 is not illustrated. In this case, the weighing hopper 4 is configured<br>
to be able to discharge the objects to be weighed selectively to the accommodating<br><br>
74<br>
chamber 5a or to the accommodating chamber 5b of the memory hopper 5 and is<br>
configured not to discharge the objects to be weighed to the inner chute 6X and to the<br>
outer chute 7X. The two accommodating chambers 5a and 5b of the memory hopper 5<br>
are each configured to be able to discharge the objects to be weighed selectively to the<br>
inner chute 6X or to the outer chute 7X. The combination calculation is, for example,<br>
performed using the weights (measured values) of the objects to be weighed inside the<br>
accommodating chambers 5a and 5b of each memory hopper 5, and the accommodating<br>
chambers 5a and 5b are candidates to be selected to make up of a discharge combination<br>
but the weighing hopper 4 does not participate in a combination. As the weights of the<br>
objects to be weighed inside the accommodating chambers 5a and 5b, weights measured<br>
in the weighing hopper 4 located thereabove are used. The weighing hopper 4 is able to<br>
participate in a combination provided that the weighing hopper 4 and the accommodating<br>
chamber 5a or 5b of the corresponding memory hopper 5 are selected simultaneously.<br>
For example, when the weighing hopper 4 and the accommodating chamber 5a of the<br>
corresponding memory hopper 5 are selected to make up of a discharge combination<br>
simultaneously, the objects to be weighed inside the weighing hopper 4 are discharged<br>
onto the inner chute 6X or onto the outer chute 7X through the accommodating chamber<br>
5a.<br>
[0152] In addition to the above, the configuration of the hoppers such as the<br>
combination hoppers or the like may be changed in various ways. In the configuration<br>
shown in the examples of the embodiments 1 and 2, in which the weighing hoppers 4 and<br>
the memory hoppers 5 are equipped, two measured values for use in combination<br>
calculation are obtained for each weight sensor 41 attached on the associated weighing<br>
hopper 4. In the configuration shown in Fig. 12(a), four measured values for use in<br>
combination calculation are obtained for each weight sensor 41. In the configuration<br>
shown in Fig. 12(b), two measured values for use in combination calculation are obtained<br>
for each weight sensor 41. In the configuration shown in Fig. 12(c), two measured<br>
values for use in combination calculation are obtained for each weight sensor 41 when<br><br>
75<br>
the weighing hoppers 4 do not participate in a combination, while three measured values<br>
for use in combination calculation are obtained for each weight sensor 41 when the<br>
weighing hoppers 4 participate in a combination. With these hopper configurations,<br>
efficient use of the weight sensors 41 which are expensive is achieved. In addition,<br>
without increasing a diameter of a circle along which the combination hoppers are<br>
arranged, the number of measured values for use in the combination calculation can be<br>
increased so that combination weighing precision is improved.<br>
[0153] Moreover, in the above described embodiments 1 and 2, the control unit 20 is<br>
not limited to being configured as the single control apparatus, but instead may be<br>
configured to include a plurality of control apparatuses disposed in a distributed manner,<br>
and these control apparatuses may co-operate to control the operation of the combination<br>
weigher.<br>
Numerous modifications and alternative embodiments of the invention will<br>
be apparent to those skilled in the art in view of the foregoing description.<br>
Accordingly, the description is to be construed as illustrative only, and is provided<br>
for the purpose of teaching those skilled in the art the best mode of carrying out the<br>
invention. The details of the structure and/or function may be varied substantially<br>
without departing from the spirit of the invention.<br>
