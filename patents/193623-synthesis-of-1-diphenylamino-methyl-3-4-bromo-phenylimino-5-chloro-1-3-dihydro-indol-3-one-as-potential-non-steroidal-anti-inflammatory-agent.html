The present invention relating to "Synthesis of l-diphenylamino-methyl-3-(4-bromo-phenylimino)-5-chloro-l,3-dihydro-indol-2-one as potential Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent"<br>
Analgesic Drugs are agents that reduce the sensation of pain. They are broadly classified into opiod analgesics and non-opiod analgesics. Non-opiod analgesics are usually associated with anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties. They are collectively called as Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). They are classified as follows.<br>

1)	Salicylic acid derivatives: Aspirin, Sodium salicylate, Choline magnesium<br>
trisalicylate, Salsalate, Diflunisal, Sulfasalazine, Olsalazine.<br>

NSAIDS are used for relieving mild to moderate pain of varied origin, but is not effective for severe pain eg., myocardial infarction or renal or biliary colic. NSAIDs may be combined with opiod analgesic for treatment of cancer pain, where their anti¬inflammatory effects act synergistically with the opiods to enhance analgesia. The anti¬inflammatory properties of NSAIDs are responsible for their are in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatic fever and other inflammatory joint conditions. Certain NSAIDs are used as effective antipyretic agents.<br>
At the usual therapeutic dose, many NSAIDS causes gastric upset (intolerance). The gastritis that occurs may be due to irritation of the gastric mucosa by the undissolved tablet or to inhibition of production of protective prostaglandins. Experimental and epidemiological studies overwhelmingly document an increased incident of gastric<br><br>
ulcers and to a lesser extend duodenal ulcers with regular consumption of NSAIDS in chronic condition. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding associated with NSAIDs (aspirin) use is usually related to erosive gastritis. Consumption of higher doses of NSAIDs (salicylates), patients may experience "salicylism" - vomiting, tinnitus, decreased hearing and vertigo which are reversed by reducing the dose.<br>
The objective of the invention is to synthesize a novel NSAID with reduced gastric-irritant property.<br>
The present invention relates to the synthesis of l-diphenylamino-methyl-3-(4-bromo-phenylimino)-5-chloro-l,3-dihydro-indol-2-one. The compound was evaluated for the analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic activity. The gastric-irritant property of the compound was evaluated.<br>

The chemical structure of the synthesized compound was confirmed by means of their Infra-Red, 'H-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Mass spectral data and elemental analysis. The synthesized compound was tested for its analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic activity by standard methods and found to be significantly active.

The physico-chemical properties and spectral properties of the compound is as follows.,<br><br><br>
Pharmacological activity<br>
The synthesized compound was evaluated for analgesic, antiinflammatory and antipyretic activity. The experimental dose was selected between the minimum effective dose and minimum non-lethal dose. Student-t test was performed for all the activities to ascertain the significance of the exhibited activities. The test compound and the standard drugs was administered in the form of a suspension (1% Carboxy methyl cellulose as vehicle) in the same route of administration. The animals was maintained in colony cages at 25 ± 2 °C, relative humidity of 45-55%, maintained under 12 hour light and dark cycle and was fed with standard animal feed. All the animals was acclimatized for a week before use.<br>
1.	Determination of LD50<br>
Acute toxicity test was performed using wistar albino mice (25-30g, intraperitoneal route of administration) for the synthesized compound to ascertain the LD50 values by Karber's arithmetical method and was found to be 878 mg/kg.<br>
2.	Analgesic activity<br>
The analgesic activity was determined by acetic acid induced writhing method using wistar albino mice (25-30g) of either sex selected by random sampling technique. Paracetamol at a dose level of 100 mg/kg was administered as standard drug for comparison. The test compound at 3 dose levels (25, 50 and lOOmg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally 15 min prior to administration of the writhing agent (0.6% v/v aqueous acetic acid - lml/lOOg). The writhings produced in the animal was observed for 30 minutes and percentage protection was calculated for analgesic activity. The analgesic activity data are presented in table 1.<br>
3.	Anti-inflammatory activity<br>
The Anti-inflammatory activity was determined by formalin induced pedal paw edema method in wistar albino rat (150-200g) of either sex by using Plethysmograph. Diclofenac sodium (50mg/kg) was administered as standard drug. The test compound was administered at 3 dose levels (100, 200 and 400 mg) intraperitoneally 30 minutes prior to administration of formalin (0.1 ml of 1% w/v) in the plantar region of the paw. The paw volume was measured at 15, 30, 60 and 120 min after formalin administration. The antiinflammatory activity data are presented in table 2.<br>
4.	Antipyretic activity<br>
The Antipyretic activity was determined by experimentally induced pyrexia in white New Zealand rabbits (0.95-1.1 kg) of either sex. Paracetamol (lOOmg/kg) was administered as standard drug for comparison. The compound at 3 dose levels (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg) was administered subcutaneously prior to administration of 12% w/v of suspended Brewer's yeast (1 ml/lOOg) subcutaneously. After administration of yeast, the rectal temperature of the rabbits was recorded by using telethermometer at 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 &amp; 180 minutes intervals. The antipyretic activity data is presented in table 3.<br><br>
5. Gastric-irritant property<br>
The gastric-irritant property of the compound was tested in pylorus-ligated rats. The compound was found to completely devoid of gastric irritant property.<br><br><br><br>
