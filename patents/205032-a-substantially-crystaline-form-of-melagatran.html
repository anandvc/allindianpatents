COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"A SUBSTANTIALLY CRYSTALINE FORM OF MELAGATRAN"<br>
AstraZeneca AB, a Swedish company of S-151 85 SodertaIje, Sweden<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relares to new solid state forms' of a drug, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them, and to processes for obtaining them.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
In the formulation of drug compositions, it is important for the drug substance to be in a form in which it can be conveniently handled and processed. This is of importance, not only from the point of view of obtaining a commercially viable manufacturing process, but also from the point of view of subsequent manufacture of pharmaceutical formulations comprising the active compound.<br>
Further, in the manufacture of drug compositions, it is important that a reliable, reproducible and constant plasma concentration profile of drug is provided following administration to a patient. This is of particular importance in the manufacture of compositions comprising antithrombotic agents.<br>
Chemical stability, solid state stability, and "shelf life" of the active ingredients are also very important factors. The drug substance, and compositions containing it, should be capable of being effectively stored over appreciable periods of time, without exhibiting a significant change in the active component's physico-chemical characteristics (e.g. its chemical composition, density, hygroscopicity and solubility). <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Moreover, it is also important to be able to provide drug in a form which is as chemically pure as possible.<br>
Amorphous materials may present significant problems in this regard. For example, such materials are typically difficult to handle and to formulate, provide for unreliable solubility, and are often found to be unstable and chemically impure.<br>
The skilled person will appreciate that, if a drug can be readily obtained in a stable crystalline form, the above problems may be solved.<br>
Thus, in the manufacture of commercially viable, and pharmaceutically acceptable, drug compositions, it is important, wherever possible, to provide drug in a substantially crystalline, and stable, form.<br>
It is to be noted, however, that this goal is not always achievable. Indeed, typically, it is not possible to predict, from molecular structure alone, what the crystallisation behaviour of a compound will be. This can usually only be determined empirically.<br>
Prior Art<br>
International patent application WO 94/29336 discloses a number of compounds, which are useful as inhibitors of serine proteases, such as thrombin, including the compound,<br>
HO2C-CH2(R)Cgl-(S)Aze-Pab-H wherein Cgl represents cyclohexylglycine, Aze represents azetidine-2-carboxylate and Pab-H represents 4-armnomethylamidinobenzene.    The compound is also known as melagatran (glycine, N-[(1R)-2-[(2S)-2-[[[[4-<br><br><br><br><br><br>
(aminoiminomethyl) phenyl] methyl] amino] carbonyl] -1 -azetidinyl]-1 -cy clohexyl-2-oxoethyl] -).<br>
A process for the synthesis of this compound is described in Example 1 of WO 94/29336, where it is obtained as crude material, by evaporation of reaction solvent following a final deprotection step. The compound is thus isolated in an amorphous form.<br>
Whether it is possible to provide melagatran in a crystalline form is not disclosed in WO 94/29336. Furthermore, no information is provided in relation to how this compound may be obtained in such a form and, more particularly, how it may be obtained in a chemically, and/or solid state, stable form.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
We have found that melagatran may be readily obtained in one or more forms that are both substantially crystalline and stable in nature.<br>
Thus, according to a first aspect of the invention there is provided melagatran in a substantially crystalline form (hereinafter referred to as "the compounds of the invention").<br>
Although we have found that it is possible to produce melagatran in forms which are greater than 80% crystalline, by "substantially crystalline" we include greater than 20%, preferably greater than 30%, and more preferably greater than 40% crystalline. The degree (%) of crystallinity may be determined by the skilled person using X-ray powder diffraction . (XRPD).    Other techniques, such as solid state NMR, FT-IR, Raman<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
spectroscopy, '   differential      scanning      calorimetry      (DSC)      and microcalorimetry, may also be used.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be in the form of a solvate, a hydrate or a mixed solvate/hydrate. Solvates may be of one or more organic solvents, such as lower alkyl (e.g. C1-4 alkyl) alcohols (e.g. methanol, ethanol or iso-propanol) or mixtures  thereof.<br>
We have found that the compounds of the invention have a surprisingly improved stability when compared with melagatran prepared as described in WO 94/29336.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention, there is thus provided a stable form of melagatran.<br>
The term "stability" as defined herein includes chemical stability and solid state stability.<br>
By "chemical stability", we include that the compound can be stored in an isolated solid form, or in the form of a solid formulation in which it may be provided in admixture with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents or adjuvants, under normal storage  conditions, with an insignificant degree of chemical degradation or decomposition.<br>
By "solid state stability", we include that the compound can be stored in an isolated solid form, or in the form of a solid formulation in which it may be provided in admixture with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents or adjuvants, under normal storage conditions,-with an insignificant degree of solid  state transformation (e.g.  crystallisation,<br><br><br><br><br><br>
recrystallisation,   solid   state phase  transition,  hydration,   dehydration, solvatisation or desolvatisation).<br>
Examples of "normal storage conditions" include temperatures of between minus 80 and plus 50°C (preferably between 0 and 40°C and more preferably ambient temperature, such as between 15 and 30°C), pressures of between 0.1  and 2 bars (preferably atmospheric pressure), and/or exposure to 460 lux of UV/visible light, for prolonged periods (i.e. greater than or equal to six months).   Under such conditions, compounds of the invention may be found to be less than 15%, more preferably less than 10%, and especially less than 5%, chemically degraded/decomposed, or  solid-state  transformed,  as appropriate.     The skilled person will appreciate   that   the   above-mentioned  upper   and   lower   limits   for temperature and pressure represent extremes of normal storage conditions, and that certain combinations of these extremes will not be experienced during normal storage (e.g. a temperature of 50°C and a pressure of 0.1 bar).<br>
The term "normal storage conditions" may also include relative humidities of between 5 and 95% (preferably 10 to 75%).   However, in the case of  certain   crystalline   forms   according   to   the   invention,   changes   in information or crystal structure by hydration and/or dehydration may occur as a result of prolonged exposure to certain extremes of relative tumidities, at normal temperatures/pressures.    For example, we have bund that crystalline forms of melagatran that are in the form of a hydrate (e.g. a monohydrate) may be stored at 10% relative humidity or above at ambient temperature/atmospheric pressure with an insignificant degree of dehydration.    However, we have also found that crystalline forms of melagatran that are in the  form of an anhydrate should be stored at less<br><br><br><br><br><br>
than 40% (preferably less than 30%, more preferably less than 20%) relative humidity at ambient temperature/atmospheric pressure, to maintain an insignificant degree of hydration.<br>
Thus, although compounds of the invention possess a greater solid state stability than forms of melagatran described in the prior art, some compounds of the invention are more solid state stable than others. In this respect, it will be appreciated by the skilled person that storage conditions may be tailored to suit the crystalline form that is being stored.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be obtained advantageously by crystallising melagatran.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a process for the production of a compound of the invention which comprises crystallising melagatran.<br>
Although melagatran may be crystallised with or without the presence of a solvent system (e.g. crystallisation may be from a melt, under supercritical conditions, or achieved by sublimation), we prefer that the crystallisation is from an appropriate solvent system.<br>
We have found that it is possible to obtain crystalline melagatran via crystallisation advantageously following dissolution and/or suspension of the compound, or, more advantageously, from reaction solutions within which the compound has been formed.<br>
The solvent system may include one or more organic solvents, such as alkyl acetates (e.g. linear or branched C1-6 alkyl acetates, such as ethyl<br><br>
acetate, iso-propyl acetate and butyl acetate), lower (e.g. linear or branched C1-6 preferably C2-4 alkyl alcohols (e.g. ethanol, iso-propanol), aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g. iso-octane, n-heptane and toluene), dialkyl ketones (e.g. methyl ethyl ketone and methyl iso-butyl ketone), dialkyl ethers (e.g. di-iso-propyl ether) and acetonitrile. Mixtures of any of the above-mentioned solvents may be used. Organic solvents may also be admixed with water or aqueous solutions.<br>
Different crystallme forms may have different solubilities in different organic solvents at any given temperature. In this respect, above-mentioned solvents may be employed as "antisolvents" (i.e. a solvent in which compounds of the invention are poorly soluble), and may thus aid the crystallisation process. Lower alkyl alcohols are preferred solvents. When lower alkyl alcohols are employed as solvent, other solvents identified above may be employed as antisolvents (especially acetonitrile and ethyl acetate).<br>
When the crystallisation takes place from a reaction solution in which melagatran has been formed, suitable solvents include lower alkyl alcohols (e.g. methanol, ethanol or iso-propanol) which may be in admixture with water.<br>
Crystallisation of compounds of the invention from an appropriate solvent system may be achieved by attaining supersaturation in a solvent system which comprises melagatran (e.g. by cooling, by solvent evaporation,. and/or via the addition of a suitable antisolvent). Crystallisation may also be effected by decreasing the solubility of the substance by the addition of a salt (such as NaCl).<br><br><br>
The skilled person will appreciate mat the concentration in solution of the compound that is to be crystallised, and the solvent system that is used, may influence crystallisation temperatures and crystallisation times.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be in the form of a solvate, a<br>
hydrate or a mixed solvate/hydrate.	'<br>
Compounds of the invention may also be in the form of an anhydrate. (The   term   "anhydrate",   when   used   in   this   context,   also   includes compounds that are "ansolvates".)  To ensure that anhydrate is produced, the solvent from which the crystallisation occurs should be dried, either before or during the crystallisation process, in order to reduce the water content below a critical level, which should preferably not be exceeded during the crystallisation.   Solvent may be dried during the crystallisation process, for example by decreasing the water content of a mixture of the compound to be crystallised and an appropriate organic solvent/aqueous solvent system (e.g. by increasing the amount of organic solvent that is present and/or removal of water by formation of an azeotrope,  with successive distillations).     The "critical level" of water depends upon factors such as temperature, concentration in solution of the compound to be  crystallised,   impurity  profile,   and   the  solvent  system  which   is employed, but may be determined non-inventively.<br>
Thus, anhydrate may be produced by crystallisation from a solvent system, including one or more organic solvents (such as lower (e.g. C2.6) alkyl alcohols (e.g. ethanol, iso-propanol), acetonitrile and/or ethyl acetate) and/or water, which solvent system is, or is rendered during the crystallisation process, substantially free of water. By "substantially free of water", we include that the water content in the solvent system is below<br><br><br>
that which will result in the formation of, at most, 20% monohydrate, for<br>
any particular solvent system and set of crystallisation conditions.<br>
To ensure that monohydrate is produced, water must be present in the solvent from which the crystallisation occurs.   The water content should preferably be above a critical  level during the crystallisation (which "critical level" will depend upon the factors mentioned above in respect of production of anhydrate). Thus, crystalline monohydrate may be prepared by crystallising melagatran from a  solvent system comprising water, and/or one or more organic solvents, including ethyl acetate, ethanol, iso-propanol, methyl iso-butyl ketone, methyl ethyl ketone, acetonitrile and mixtures thereof.<br>
To ensure that a solvate is produced, an appropriate organic solvent, capable of forming a solvate, must be present as part of the solvent system from which the crystallisation occurs. Solvates that are in the form of "mixed" solvate/hydrate may also be prepared. For example, we have found that mixed lower alkyl (e.g. C1-4 alkyl) alcohol (e.g. memanol, ethanol and/or iso-propanol) solvate/hydrates may be prepared by crystallising a compound of the invention from a mixture of lower alkyl alcohols (e.g. methanol, ethanol and/or iso-propanol), water and an antisolvent (e.g. acetonitrile), for example as described hereinafter.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a compound of the invention that is in the form of a solvate, a compound of the invention that is in the form of a monohydrate, a compound of the invention that is in the form of a mixed lower (e.g. C1-4) alkyl alcoholate/hydrate (e.g. an iso-propanol solvate/hydrate), and a compound of the invention that is in the form of an anhydrate.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
As may be appreciated by the skilled person, the crystalline form that is obtained depends upon both the kinetics and the thermodynamics of the crystallisation process. Under certain thermodynamic conditions (solvent system, temperature, pressure and concentration of the compound of the invention), one crystalline form may be more stable than another (or indeed any other) However, other crystalline forms that may have, in comparison, a relatively low thermodynamic stability, may be kinetically-favoured. Thus, in addition, kinetic factors, such as time, impurity profile, agitation, the presence of seeds, etc. may also influence which forms appear. Thus, the procedures discussed herein may be adapted by the skilled person as appropriate in order to obtain different crystalline forms of melagatran.<br>
In order to ensure that crystalline forms as described herein are prepared in the absence of other crystalline forms described herein, crystallisations are preferably carried out by seeding with nuclei and/or seed crystals of the desired crystalline form in the complete absence of nuclei and/or seed crystals of other crystalline forms described herein.<br>
Compounds of the invention that are anhydrates contain no more than 3%, preferably 1% and more preferably 0.5% (w/w) water, whether such water is bound (crystal water or otherwise) or not. Solvates, hydrates and mixed hydrates/solvates contain no less than 0.5 mol of solvent and/or water (as appropriate) per mol of melagatran.<br>
Preferred compounds of the invention are those that are in the form of a hydrate, such as a monohydrate. According to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a compound of the invention that contains at<br><br><br><br><br><br>
least 0.5, preferably 0.85 and more preferably 0.90 mol water per mol of melagatran, whether such water is bound (crystal water or otherwise) or not.<br>
We have also found mat compounds of the invention in one crystalline form can be converted  into other  crystalline  forms. ' For example, crystalline monohydrate may also be formed by elulriation of other crystalline forms (e.g. anhydrates and/or other solvates) in water or a mixture of a sufficient amount of water and one or several organic solvents  (such as  ethanol,  iso-propanol,  ethyl  acetate,  acetonitrile  or methyl iso-butyl ketone). The slurry that is formed may preferably be seeded with crystals of the crystalline monohydrate in order to ensure that an appropriate transformation takes place.<br>
Further, drying temperature and drying time may affect the solid state properties and/or the solid state form of compounds of the invention (e.g. solvates, hydrates or mixtures thereof).    For example, in the case of hydrates,  dehydration may  occur  at  low  humidities  and/or elevated temperatures   and/or  reduced  pressure.   For  example,   following   the formation of crystalline monohydrate, there is a critical humidity level below which drying may be performed, which may result in crystal water being lost, and a solid state transformation to an anhydrate occurring. Conversely, anhydrates may be converted (completely or partially) to monohydrates in cases where they are subjected to an atmosphere with a relative humidity that is sufficiently high.<br>
Thus, according to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a process for the conversion of one crystalline form of a compound of the invention to another, which comprises recrystallising a compound of the<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
invention from an appropriate solvent system, and/or, in the case of interconversion of anhydrate and monohydrate, subjecting the crystalline anhydrate or monohydrate (as appropriate) to an atmosphere with an appropriate relative humidity level.<br>
The preparation, and characterisation, of inter alia anhydrate, monohydrate, and solvate/hydrate forms of compounds of the invention, are described hereinafter. Different crystalline forms of the compounds of the invention (e.g. the anhydrate and the monohydrate) may be readily characterised using X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) methods, for example as described hereinafter.<br>
Compounds of the invention may be isolated using techniques which are well known to those skilled in the art, for example decanting, filtering or centrifuging.<br>
We have found that, by employing the crystallisation process as described herein, it is possible to produce compounds of the invention with a chemical purity which is above mat of the melagatran which is to be isolated in the first instance.<br>
Further purification of compounds of the invention may be effected using techniques which are well known to those skilled in the art. For example impurities may be removed by way of recrystallisation from an appropriate solvent system (e.g. lower alkyl alcohol, such as ethanol or iso-propanol), which may include antisolvent (e.g. iso-octane, acetonitrile, ethyl acetate, methyl ethyl ketone), water, or a combination of these solvents.   Suitable temperatures and times for the recrystallisation depend<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
upon the concentration in  solution of the compound to be crystallised, and ' upon the solvent system which is used.<br>
When compounds of the invention are crystallised, or recrystallised, as described herein, the resultant compound is in a form which has the unproved chemical and solid state stability mentioned hereinbefore.<br>
Pharmaceutical Preparations and Medical Use<br>
In accordance with the invention, the compounds of the invention may be administered orally, intravenously, subcutaneously, buccally, rectally, dermally, nasally,. tracheally, bronchially, by any other parenteral route, or via inhalation, in the form of a pharmaceutical preparation comprising the compound of the invention in a pharmaceutically acceptable dosage form. However, we prefer that the compound of the invention is a form which is suitable for oral or parenteral, such as subcutaneous, administration.<br>
Depending on the disorder, and the patient to be treated, as well as the route of administration, the compounds may be administered at varying doses.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a pharmaceutical formulation including a. compound of the invention in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant, diluent or carrier. Suitable formulations include those disclosed in international patent applications WO 94/29336, WO 96/14084, WO 96/16671, WO 97/39770, WO 97/45138, WO 98/16252 and WO 00/12043.<br><br><br>
The compounds of the invention may be further processed before being admixed with a suitable carrier, diluent or adjuvant. For example, the crystalline form may be milled or ground into smaller panicles.<br>
We prefer that formulations comprising compounds of the. invention are in a form that is suitable for parenteral (e.g. subcutaneous) delivery. In this respect, compounds.of the invention can be admixed with an aqueous solvent carrier system (see, for example, international patent application WO 00/12043) in order to provide a pharmaceutical formulation that is in the form of a liquid and/or a solution.<br>
The amount of compound of the invention which is employed in such a formulation will depend on the condition, and patient, to be treated, as well as the compound(s) which is/are employed, but can be detennined . non-inventively.<br>
The  compounds   of the   invention  are   useful   because   they  possess<br>
pharmacological    activity.	They , are    therefore  indicated     as<br>
pharmaceuticals.<br>
In particular, me compounds of the invention are potent inhibitors of thrombin, for example as demonstrated' in the. tests described in WO : 94/29336.   The compounds of me invention are expected to be useful in, the treatment of conditions where inhibition of thrombin is required or desirable, including those described in, for example WO 94/29336 and<br>
VO 97/23499 (Indian application number 2845/DEL/96), the disclosures n which documents are hereby incorporated by reference.<br><br><br>
Suitable doses of the compound of the invention in the therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of mammalian, especially human, patients are in the range 0.4 to 40 mg per day, and/or 0.0002 to 4 mg/kg (preferably 0.002 to 1 mg/kg) body weight, at parenteral administration, and 2 to 1000 mg per day, and/or 0.001 to 100 mg/kg (preferably 0.01 to 25 mg/kg) body weight, at oral administration.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a method of treatment of a condition where inhibition of thrombin is required or desired, which method includes administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention to a patient in need of such treatment.<br>
For the avoidance of doubt, by "treatment" we include the therapeutic treatment, as well as the prophylaxis, of a condition.<br>
Compounds of the invention have the advantage that they are in a form which provides for improved ease of handling. Further, compounds of the invention have the advantage that they may be produced in forms which have improved chemical and solid state stability. Thus, compounds may be stable when stored over prolonged periods.<br>
Compounds of the invention may also have the advantage that they may be prepared in good yields, in a higher purity, in less time, more conveniently, and at a lower cost, than forms of melagatran prepared previously.<br>
The invention is illustrated, but in no way limited, by the following examples, with reference to the enclosed figures in which:<br><br><br>
Figure 1 shows an X-ray powder diffractogram for the crystalline form of melagatran anhydrate obtained by way of Example 2.<br>
Figure 2 shows an X-ray powder diffractogram for the crystalline form of melagatran monohydrate obtained by way of Example 4.<br>
Figure 3 shows an X-ray powder diffractogram for the crystalline form of melagatran anhydrate obtained by way of Example 6.<br>
Figure 4 shows an X-ray powder diffractogram for the crystalline form of melagatran iso-propanolate/hydrate obtained by way of Example 10.<br>
General Procedures<br>
X-ray powder diffraction analysis (XRPD) was performed on samples prepared according to standard methods, for example those described in Giacovazzo, C. et al (1995), Fundamentals of Crystallography, Oxford University Press; Jenkins, R. and Snyder, R. L. (1996), Introduction to X-Ray Powder Diffractometry, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York; Bunn, C. W. (1948), Chemical Crystallography, Clarendon Press, London; or Klug, H. P. &amp; Alexander, L. E. (1974), X-ray Diffraction Procedures, John Wiley and Sons, New York. X-ray analyses were performed using a Siemens D5000 diffractometer and/or a Philips X'Pert MPD.<br>
Differentia] scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed using a Mettler DSCS20 instrument, according to standard methods, for example those described in Hohne, G. W. H. et al (1996), Differential Scanning Calorimetry, Springer, Berlin.<br><br><br><br>
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using a Mettler Toledo TGA850 instrument.<br>
Forms prepared in accordance with the Examples below showed "essentially" the same XRPD diffraction patterns and/or DSC thermograms as other Examples disclosed below, when it was clear from the relevant patterns/thermograms (allowing for experimental error) that the same crystalline form had been formed. Thus, limits of experimental error for DSC onset temperatures may be in the range ±5°C (e.g. ±2°C), and for XRPD distance values may be in the range ±2 on the last decimal place.<br>

DMAP (3.0 eq.) and Boc-(R)Cgl-(S)Aze-OH (1.0 eq.) were dissolved in-ethyl acetate:acetonitrile (80:20 v/v) at a volume of 18 L/kg of Boc-(R)Cgl-(S)Aze-OH at 20°C. Pab-Z x HC1 (1.15 eq.) was charged into the resultant solution. EDAC x HC1 (1.4 eq.) was added, and the slurry was stirred at 25°C for about 3 hours. A sample was removed for in-process control.   The reaction solution was worked up when at least 95 %<br>
 	conversion was determined to have taken place. The slurry was then<br>
filtered, and the filter cake was washed with ethyl acetate:acetonitrile<br>
(80:20 v/v). Aqueous sodium chloride solution (10% w/w) was added and<br>
the pH was adjusted to 4.0 with hydrochloric acid solution (4_M). The<br>
solution was thoroughly stirred for at least 15 minutes.   The water phase<br><br><br>
was separated off and the organic phase was extracted with aqueous sodium chloride solution (20% w/w).  The solution was thoroughly stirred. for at least 15 minutes.    The water phase was separated off and the organic phase extracted with aqueous sodium chloride solution (10% w/w).    The pH was adjusted to 8.0 with aqueous potassium carbonate solution (25% w/w).   The solution was thoroughly stirred for at least 15 minutes.     The  water phase was  separated off.     Ethyl  acetate and acetonitrile were evaporated under vacuum (ca. 15 kPa) at a temperature of ca. 40°C, until the volume in the reactor was approximately 8 L/kg of starting material.   More ethyl acetate (13 L/kg of starting material) was added during the evaporation process.   A sample was removed for water content analysis.   Ethyl alcohol (10% v/v of the total volume) was men added.  The solution was used directly in me next step.<br>
(b) H-(R)Cgl-(S)Aze-Pab-Z<br>
(i) The solution from step (a) was cooled to 10°C.   Methane sulphonic acid (7 eq. per eq. of Boc-(R)Cgl-(S)Aze-Z) was charged, mamtaining the temperature below 20°C.   The temperature was adjusted to 22°C and the reaction solution stirred (4 hours) until at least 95% conversion had occurred (as determined by HPLC).  The reaction solution was cooled to 10°C and extracted with a cooled (10°C) 25% (w/w) aqueous potassium carbonate solution (8 eq. K2CO3) for at least 15 minutes.  The temperature was adjusted to 20°C and the water phase was separated off.  The organic phase was washed with a mixture of aqueous sodium chloride solution (10%  w/w) and potassium carbonate (1  eq. K2CO3) for at least  15 minutes.   The water phase was separated off.    The solution of the sub¬title compound was used directly in the next step.<br>
(ii) The sub-title compound was prepared using essentially__the same process as that described in step (b)(i) above, except that the temperature<br><br><br><br><br><br>
was adjusted to 25°C, and the reaction was stirred for 5 hours, following<br>
addition of methane sulphonic acid.<br>
(c) Bzl-OC(O)-CH2(R)Cgl-(S)Aze-Pab-Z<br>
(i) To the reaction solution from step (b)(i) above, further ethyl acetate, water and potassium carbonate (3.0 eq, per eq. of H-(R)Cgl-(S)Aze-Pab-Z) were charged, and the reaction mixture was stirred until me potassium carbonate dissolved.   Benzyl bromoacetate (1.2 eq. per eq. of H-(R)Cgl-(S)Aze-Pab-Z) was added and the reactor temperature was increased to 40°C.   The temperamre was maintained for about 20 hours.   A sample was  removed  for  analysis  by  HPLC.     When  95%   conversion had occurred, the temperature was decreased to 20°C and the reaction mixture was allowed to settle for at least 20 minutes.    The water phase was separated off and the solution cooled to 10°C. Aqueous sodium chloride solution (4% w/w) was added and the pH adjusted to 4.0 with 4 M hydrochloric acid solution.    The two-phase system was thoroughly mixed for at least 15 minutes and allowed to separate for at least 20 minutes. The water phase was separated off.    Sodium chloride solution (4% w/w) was added and the pH adjusted to 4.0 with 4 M hydrochloric acid solution.   The solution was thoroughly mixed for at least 15 minutes and allowed  to separate for at least 20 minutes.    The water phase was separated off.    Water was added to the resultant solution, which was cooled to 10°C.  The pH was adjusted to 2.5 with 4 M hydrochloric acid solution.    The two-phase system was thoroughly stured for at least 15 minutes and allowed to separate for at least 20 minutes.  The water phase was separated and charged slowly into a mixture of potassium carbonate in ethyl acetate.    The pH was adjusted to 7.0 with 25%  (w/w) aqueous potassium carbonate solution and the reaction mixture was thoroughly mixed for at least 15 minutes at 20 °C and allowed to separate for at least<br><br>
20 minutes.    The water phase was separated off.    Ethyl acetate was evaporated under vacuum (ca. 10 kPa) at a maximum temperature of 40°C until the volume in the reaction vessel was about .8.5 L/kg of Boc-(R)Cgl-(S)Aze-OH).    More ethyl acetate was added (5 L/kg of Boc-(R)Cgl-(S)Aze-OH) and evaporated again under reduced pressure until the volume in the reaction vessel was about 8.5 L/kg .  A sample was taken for water content analysis.   If the water content was less than 0.5% (w/v), water was  added to give a total  water content of 0.5-2.0%   (w/v).     The temperature was adjusted to 45°C, the reaction solution was seeded with 2 % (w/w) of the sub-title compound and the slurry was thoroughly stirred for 10 hours, then cooled to 30°C over 3 hours and subsequently stirred for at least 3 hours.   Toluene (5 L/kg of the sub-title compound) was charged-and the slurry was stirred for at least 15 minutes.   Ethyl acetate and toluene were evaporated under reduced pressure (ca. 10 kPa) until the volume was the same as before the toluene addition.   Toluene (5 L/kg of the sub-title compound) was added and the slurry was stirred for at least 30 minutes.   The ethyl acetate and toluene were evaporated again under reduced pressure until the volume was the same as before the toluene addition.   Toluene was then added to a total volume of about 11 L/kg of sub-title compound. The slurry was carefully stirred for at least 3 hours at 20°C. The crystals were filtered off and washed with toluene and dried in vacuum (
(ii) The sub-title compound was prepared using essentially the same process as that described in step (c)(i) above, except that:<br>
(1)	before reducing the temperature to 20°C following addition of benzyl bromoacetate, 96% conversion had occurred; and<br>
(2)	a third extraction at pH 4 was carried out.<br><br>
(d) Melagatran Monohydrate<br>
(i) Ethanol was charged into a reactor at 20°C.   Pd/C (10% w/w of Bzl-OC(O)-CH2-(R)CgI-(S)Aze-Pab-Z), elutriated in water, was added. (The total amount of water was 6% v/v of total solvent.)    Bzl-OC(O)-.CH2-(R)Cgl-(S)Aze-Pab-Z   (from step (c)(i) above; 8% w/v of total solvent) was charged, and the temperature was raised to 25°C. 3.5 bar pressure of H2 was applied to the reaction mixture, which was stirred vigorously for 5 h.    When the reaction was finished (as determined by HPLC),  the temperature was set to 20°C, and the reaction slurry was treated with activated carbon (10% w/w of starting material) elutriated in water (0.5 L/kg of starting material) over 0.5 h.    The catalyst and carbon were filtered off and the filter cake was washed with ethanol (5 L/kg of melagatran anhydrate).   Ethanol was then evaporated at reduced pressure until the volume was 4 L/kg of melagatran anhydrate.   iso-Propanol (14 L/kg of melagatran anhydrate) was charged and the solution was again evaporated at reduced pressure (at a temperature between 20 and 30°C) to a volume of about 7 L/kg of melagatran anhydrate.    The solution was filtered and washed with iso-propanol (7 L/kg of melagatran anhydrate). Ethanol/iso-propanol   were   evaporated   at   reduced   pressure   (at   a temperature between 20 and 30°C) to a volume of about. 4.4 L/kg of melagatran anhydrate.   The water content was analyzed and adjusted to 0.6 - 0.7 L/kg of melagatran anhydrate.    The solution was warmed to 45°C and acetonitrile (6.0 L/kg of melagatran anhydrate) was added over 20 minutes, whereupon crystallization was started by seeding with the title compound (obtained analogously to the method desribed in Example 4 below; 2% w/w product).    The mixture was stirred for about 15 h. Acetonitrile (6.5 L/kg of melagatran anhydrate) was charged into the vessel.  The slurry was stirred at 40°C for 3 h, then cooled to 20°C over 1 h and finally stirred at 20°C for at least 1 h.  The crystals were isolated<br><br>
by filtration and washed with acetonitrile:iso-propanol (9:1 (v/v), 3.5 L/kg of the title compound), acetonitrile (2 L/kg of the tide compound) and finally ethyl acetate (3 L/kg of the title compound).   The crystals were dried at 40°C and 150-200 mbar.<br>
(ii) The title compound was prepared using essentially the same as that described in process as step (d)(i) above, except that:<br>
(1)	the amount of catalyst initially employed was 12% w/w of starting material;<br>
(2)	the total amount of water in the reaction was 7 % w/v of total solvent;<br>
(3)	the filtration following the second evaporation was not carried out;<br>
(4)	the in-process control for water content after the evaporations was not carried out (water (0.6 L/kg) was added, instead of adjustments to 0.6 to 0.7 L/kg being carried out);<br>
(5)	the amount of washing solvents were:-<br><br>
(I)	acetonitrile:iso-propanol - 3 L/kg of melagatran anhydrate;<br>
(II)	acetonitrile - 3 L/kg of melagatran anhydrate; and<br>
(III)	ethyl acetate - 5 L/kg of melagatran anhydrate;<br><br>
(6)	the drying temperature was 45°C; and<br>
(7)	the lower limit for me pressure during drying was 100 mbar.<br>
The crystals were analyzed by XRPD, TGA, GC, DSC and Karl-Fischer titration. They showed essentially the same XRPD pattern, and DSC thermogram, as those exhibited by me form obtained according to Example 4 below.<br><br>

Example 2<br>
A reaction solution (ethanol:water) containing approximately 64.8 g of melagatran, prepared analogously to the method described in Example 1 above (excluding the last crystallisation step), in a round-bottomed flask, was concentrated by evaporation at reduced pressure until  149 g of solution remained.  200 mL of absolute ethanol was then charged into the vessel, and the solution was concentrated again until 89.5 g remained.  A white precipitate was formed.   A further 250 mL of absolute ethanol was then charged into the vessel, and the slurry was agitated at 30 to 35°C until all of the solute was dissolved.  The solution was concentrated again until 78.9 g of solution remained.    A further 550 mL of absolute ethanol was added, and the suspension was agitated at 38°C until everything dissolved. The water content was 0.5% (w/w) as determined by Karl-Fischer titration. The solution was filtered, and the filter was washed with 200 mL of absolute ethanol.  The solution was heated to 30°C under a N2-atmosphere, and acetonitrile was charged into the vessel in portions until the solution became opaque (a total of 1380 mL of acetonitrile was charged). The solution was seeded using seed crystals of the tide product. The   suspension   was   agitated   overnight,   and   cooled   to   ambient temperature. The crystals were washed under reduced pressure with 350 mL of a mixture of ethanol and acetonitrile (1:5 (v/v)), and then with acetonitrile (300 mL).  The crystals were then dried at 40°C (0.1 mbar). After 4 hours drying, the particles were milled.   The drying was then continued under the same conditions as above for an additional 20 hours.<br>
