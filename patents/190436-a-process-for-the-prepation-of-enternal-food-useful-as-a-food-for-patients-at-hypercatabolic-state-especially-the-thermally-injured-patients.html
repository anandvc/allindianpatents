				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a process for preparation of enteral food useful as a food (nutritional support) for  patients at   hypercatabolic  state  especially  the   thermally   injured pat i ents.<br>
Proper nutritional support not only helps to cure the disease, but also prevents it's recurrence and decreases the mortality and morbidity of hospitalised patients, and also cut down the hospita1iration expenses substantially. Very often, hospitalised patients need special nutritional care. Liquid foods or enteral foods are administered orally or through feeding tube to the patients whenever the patient is not able to take normal or even semi-solid foods due to functional or organic disorder, but the gut functions normally. Enteral foods are also given to patients, as a part or total nutritional support to cope up with the extended nutritional requirements in some of the special phvsiotogica1 conditions such as complicated pregnancy, anorexia, burn inlury, sepsis, trauma etc.<br>
Development of enteral formulae for meeting nutritional requirement of needy patients is receiving greater attention in recent years. A wide range of enteral foods suitable for patients of different physiological conditions are produced mainly in USA, Japan, Australia and some European countries and marketed globally, but in India only two brands of general category enteral foods have been introduced and that too very<br>
recently (Table 1).<br>
Table 1: Some of the General Category and Disease Specific Enteral Foods Specially	designed formula<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
It is very well known that patients suffering from cirrhosis of liver, burns or thermal injury, renal failure and some other physiological conditions require special nutritional support. Accordingly, enteral foods for patients suffering from hepatic, renal and some other diseases have been developed and marketed mostly in developed countries. To the best of our knowledge, no packaged food is available , that meets the nutritional requirements of patients suffering from hypercatabolic conditions especially of the burns or thermally injured patients,<br>
The physiological conditions of burn patients is marked with increased basal metabolic rate, raised core temperature, hyperdynamic circulation, protein catabolism, futile substrate cycling, lipolysis, loss of lean body mass, suppressed immune response followed by severe infection, stress induced hyperacidity, development of ilias combined with anorexia and poor wound healing. These conditions cause nutritional imbalance, specifically with reference to protein, energy and electrolytes. The hormonal imbalance caused due to burn injury induces the release of higher levels of catecholamine which raise the abnormally high metabolic rate. Because of this and to cope up with the changed nutritional and metabolic states, the<br>
patients  need  the diet that is exceptionally  rich  in  energy, protein and some of the vitamins<br>
Depending upon age. sex and various physiological conditions, the thermally injured patients with over 3O% burn surface area or patients under hypercatabo1ic state require 2OOO to 50OO R'ca 1 energy and 80-2OO g of protein of high biological value, backedup with appropriate levels of vitamins, minerals and other protective nutrients per day. This special nutritional demand has to be met right from the day one of burn injury till a satisfactory nutritional status of the patient is achieved, otherwise the patient goes into negative nitrogen balance, suppressed immunomodu1atory system followed by infection which generally lead to mortality.<br>
In most of the cases, blenderized foods containing mainly egg, milk, fruit juice, sugar and high protein health food are administered to thermally injured patients. Such foods generally do not provide some of the specific nutrients and adequate quantities of vitamins and minerals and also may not meet the extended requirement of calorie and protein. Some of ths ingredients may be allergic and the possibility of microbiological contamination also exists. The advantages of egg as one of the ingredients of the blenderised foods for burn patients has been well recognised and many a time fresh beater, egg is fed to the patients perorally in the form of eggnog or<br>
other recipe. But. the practical difficulty of feeding quite a large quantity of egg limits the egg based food intake. Moreover, the fresh egg fed as such often causes digestive problems and its biotin is also not available to the patients. Boiled or heat treated egg protein is more easily digestible, but heat treatment coagulates the egg proteins rendering it unsuitable for enteral feeding, and because of this peroral feeding of egg based food has not been practiced hitherto.<br>
The chemically defined or modular enteral foods may meet the gross nutritional needs but may not contain the specific nutrients in desired proportion, possess poor sensory attributes, high osmolality, lack in natural microflora and many a times cause diarrhoea, vomiting and exert high renal load, which further complicate the patients conditions.<br>
On the other hand, enteral foods prepared from natural food ingredients maintain intestinal mucosal integrity and normal metabolism. Such foods also diminish the transfer of bacteria from the lumen across the intestinal wall into the 1ymphovascu1ar system and control gastric stress ulceration besides supplying the nutrients in usual food form. Therefore, enteral foods for burn patients based on natural food ingredients are highly desirable.<br>
The  food  for burn patients should contain proteins rich  in<br>
high  proportion  of  branched  chain  amino  acids  (BCAA)   and arginine. and iipids rich in W '3 and H  fatty  acids. The  BCAA supply energy for enhanced local metabolism and help in synthesis of immunomodu1atory compounds such as immuno-g1obu1 in, leucocytes and  lymphocytes.   The arginine helps in  improving  the  immune status  by  enhanching the function of  urea  cycle,  diminishing protein  catabolism and raising the competence of  T-1ymphocytes. W 3   and  M c- fatty acid contribute  for  rapid  wound  healing, enhancing  immunity to infection, maintenance of blood  viscosity and cell membrane integrity.<br>
It is heartening to note that. some of the Medical Institutes/Hospitals in the country reluctantly admit patients with more than 50% of total burn surface area (TBSA), mainly because of non availability of proper food to meet their nutritional need, which often leads to morbidity and mortality of the injured ones.<br>
The forgoing discussions indicate that, there is a dire need for development of a food that meets the nutritional requirements and also the protective components for patients at hypercatabo1ic state particularly the burned patients, based on natural food ingredients that provide protein containing BCAA and arginine, lipids supplying H i ar. d W c- fatty acids and packed with tissue building, immunity development components and<br>
the essential vitamins and minerals.<br>
Therefore, the main object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparation of enteral food specially useful as a food for the patients under hypercatabo1ic state with special reference to burn injury.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparation of enteral food useful for the patients under hypercatabo1ic state containing egg as one of the food components and still the food slurry maintain a free flowing state even after heating.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparation of enteral food useful for the patients under hypercatabo1ic state that makes use of natural ingredients such as cereals rich in easily digestible carbohydrates, proteins rich in sulphur amino acids, BCAA and arginine, and vegetable or animal oil sources that provide W and H c fatty acids.<br>
Accordingly,  the present invention provides	a process	for<br>
preparation   of  food  useful  for  feeding  the	patients	at<br>
hypercatabo1ic    state  with  special  reference	to  burns	or<br>
thermally injured patients which comprises;<br>

xi)       Blending       malt   flours     in  the   range   of   15   -   30%   obtained from different     cereals     in step     (vi)      separately  or mixture   of them,   edible     amaranth     seed flour   in   the   range   of   5   -   15% obtained  in  step   (vii) ,   soya  flour   in   the   range   of   5   -   25   % obtained  in  step   (viii),   mashed     egg in  the  range  of  15-25% obtained     in     step      (ix) ,     pasteurized     fresh     milk    (    0.5   -    3    % )    ,    sucrose   (   5 -  10  %}   ,   fish   oil    (    5-   10%)    ,    soya oil    (   5   -10%),   edible   gum   (0.5 -3%   )   and glycerin   (0.5-2%),<br>
(xii) Mixing the resultant blend with potable water to prepare a 25-35% solid contents slurry, heating the slurry at a temperature ranging 55- 65° C by raising the temperature at the rate of 2-3°C per min, maintaining the slurry at that temperature for 5-20 min further, raising the temperature to boiling, bailing for 5-10 rain and cooling to ambient temperature,<br>
(xiii) Adding the curd obtained in step (x) , and also the premix of vitamins and minerals to the slurry,<br>
(xiv)      Homogenising       the    mixture  by  known    methods     and       spray<br>
drying  the  slurry  at 160-190°C  air  temperature  and  60-80°C material temperature.<br>
In  an embodiment of the present invention, 15-3O% of any  of the cereal malt flour alone or mixture of them, 10-2O% of  finger millet malt flour, 5-15% amaranth seed flour. 5-15% defatted  and heat treated soya flour, 70-100 ml (equivalent to 15-25%  solids) of mashed whole egg, 15O-2OO ml (equivalent to 15-25% solids)  of fresh milk, O.5-3% exudate gum preferably acasia. 5-lO% fish  oil preferably  from Cod-liver, Menhaden or of similar source,  5-10% soya  oil, 5-10% sucrose, O.5-2% glycerin, 5-15ml% curd  enriched with  Lactic  acid bacteria and 2-6% premix of  a  pharmaceutical grade  vitamins  and  minerals  are blended  and  the  slurry  is homogenised and  spray dried at 160-190° air temperature and  60 80°C material temperature.<br>
Preparation of low fibre and enzyme rich malt flour from cereals for the enteral food may be effected by steeping the viable seeds separately in excess water, germinating the steeped seeds separately by known methods, drying the sprouts separately either in sun or mechanically, removing the rootlets separately by known methods, kilning the derooted malts separately either by passing warm air or by contact heat and moist conditions the malted cereals separately and milling the malts separately and sieving off the seed coat and bran. The soy flour is heat treated<br>
preferably toasted by known methods.  The eggs used may be  fresh avian eggs preferably from hen and fish oil may be from Menhaden, Sardine, Herring or Cod liver or similar source.  Soya oil may be from any of the genetic source of soyabean freed from non  edible matter.   The gum used may be purified plant or sea weed  exudate preferably from acasia.  The full fat or partially toned milk may be from cow or buffalo or goat.  The glycerin used may be of food or  pharmaceutical  grade.  The  curd may  be  from  edible  milk-cultured with pure culture of Lactic acid bacteria. Vitamins  and minerals  may  be of  British/1ndian/United  States  pharamacopia grade.<br>
The cereals and finger millet may be malted to enrich them with hydrolytic enzymes, to enhance their protein and carbohydrate digestibility, mineral availability and thus to improve their overall nutritional quality. The amaranth seeds are processed substantially to gelatinise the starch and to develop aroma yet most of the nutrients of the seed remain in the product.<br>
The ingredients for the enteral food are selected so that the food not only serves as the nutritional support to the patients but also helps in the speedy recovery from the burn injury. The cereal malts provide easily digestible carbohydrates, proteins, calcium and other essential minerals and sulphur amino acids and also are of diuretic characteristics. Amaranth serves<br>
as  a  good source of protein as well as arginine.  Egg,  besides<br>
having  high biological value protein   provides  branched  chain<br>
amino acids. Defatted soy not only contributes to the proteins of<br>
the  food but also provides dietary fibre component of the  food.<br>
The  dietary fibre  helps to reduce the occurrence  of  diarrhoea<br>
and  constipation  and  also contributes  for  other  well  known<br>
nutritional  and physiological benefits. Soy and fish  oils.  the<br>
good  sources  of W o and W fatty acids respectively,  help  in<br>
immune  system  development.   Curd serves as a  main  source  of<br>
Lactic acid bacteria  which facilitates to maintain the desirable<br>
intestinal microflora and also helps in digestion and  absorption<br>
of nutrients in the intestine  and  colon.  The  plant gums  help<br>
in  tissue building. The cereal malt enzymes partially  hydrolyse<br>
the starch and proteins, reduce the water holding capacity of the<br>
food  and enable to prepare  energy dense (1 to 2 Kcal per ml  of<br>
food) at free flowing slurry consistency.<br>
Using the process of the present invention, it is  possible to  prepare  an  enteral food that  could  meet  the  nutritional requirement or serve as a nutritional supplement to the  patients at  hypercatabo1ic  state,  especially  the  burns  or  thermally injured ones.<br>
This  particular  process to  prepare  high-protein,  high-energy  food  based  on day to day used food  materials  such  as<br>
cereals, egg. milk, fish oil, vegetable oil, sugar, plant gum, glycerin and provides proper nutritional support to hypercatabo1ic or burn patients.<br>
The cereals with over 95% germination are steeped in excess water   for  12-24  hr  and  germinated  for  48-72  hr.   During germination the sprouts are kept moist and mixed occasionally  to aerate  and  to facilitate uniform germination. The  sprouts  are sundried or mechanically dried at 4O-6O°C to about 14%  moisture. The root and shoot are removed by brushing and the derooted green malt  kilned  at 55-65°C either in air or by  contact  heat.  The malted  paddy is dehusked mechanically in rice sheller.   To  the dehusked  rice  malt and other  malted  cereals  3-7%  additional water is sprayed, tempered for 5-15 min and the individual  malts are  separately  milled  in  abrassive.  comminuting,   friction, roller,  attrition  or alike mills alone or in  sequence   or  in combination with one or more milling systems.  The seed coat  and coarse  bran  are  removed from the flour  by  sifting  the  meal through  8O - 12O mesh sieve. The defatted soya flour is  toasted in a grain roaster at 60-8O°C for 15-3O min.  Fresh egg (yolk and white  together) are mashed in a wet blender for 10-15 sec.   The malt  flours from one or more cereals, amaranth seed flour,  soya flour, glycerin, gum acasia, sugar, fish and soya oils and   milk-are  blended  with  mashed  egg.  To  the   blend,  predetermined quantity  of water is mixed to obtain 25-35% slurry.  The  slurry<br>
is heated by raising the temperature at the rate of 2-3^C per min upto about 60°C and maintained at that temperature for iO-20 min. the contents are boiled for about 5-10 min and the slurry is cooled to ambient temperature. Freshly prepared curd enriched with Lactic acid bacteria, amounting to 10% of total milk and the predetermined amount of vitamins and minerals are mixed and the slurry is homogenised. The slurry is dried in a spray dryer maintained at 160-19O°C inlet temperature and 6O-80°C material temperature. The enteral food thus prepared is immediately packed in air tight containers. The food should be reconstituted in warm water at 2O-4O % slurry consistency and fed to the patients orally or through tube depending upon the age and physiological conditions of the patients.<br>
The  examples  given below illustrate the  process  of  the<br>
present  invention.  These examples should not  be  construed  to<br>
limit  the  scope of the invention. Any modification  within  the<br>
scope  of  the description given above from part of  the  present<br>
i nvent ion.<br>
Example  1<br>
Clean viable barley (Hcrdeum vuigare) seeds are steeped  in excess  water  for  24 hr, changing the  steep  water  twice  and germinated upto 72 hr at about 25°C.  During germination  the sprouts  are kept moist by spraying  water and mixed gently  once<br><br>
in  24 hr to prevent interlocking of rootlets.  The  sprouts  are dried  at  about  50°C in a air dryer,  derooted  in  a  brushing machine and the green malt kilned at about 55°C for about 45  min in  a grain roaster by contact heat.   Malted  barley  seeds  are sprayed  with additional 5% water, tempered for about 1O min  and milled in a roller mill adjusted to O.465 and O.O35 mm break roll and  O.O65  and  O.O35 mm reduction  roll  clearance.  The  flour fractions  from  break  rolls, reduction rolls  and  bran  duster through are pooled together. Amaranth seeds are popped in hot air medium  at  about 23O C. The detached seed coat is  separated  by aspirating  and  the  popped seed  material  is  pulversied.  The defatted soya flour is toasted at 80°C for 3O min by contact heat in  a grain roaster.  Fresh hen's egg, free from shell is  mashed in a wet blender for about 7 sec. To illustrate the scope of  the present  invention, in this example. 3Og barley malt  flour,  lOg popped   amaranth  seed  flour,  5g  toasted  soya  flour,   8Om1 emulsified  egg, 5g sugar, ig gum acasia, 5g Cod liver  and  2.5g soya  oils both containing O.O2% tertiary butyl  hydroxy  quinone (TBHQ).    Ig glycerin  and 180 ml milk are blended and the  blend is mixed with water to prepare 3O% slurry.  The slurry is  heated in  a steam jacketed cooker  with constant stirring, raising  the temperature  at the rate of 2-3°C per min to 60°C. maintained  at that temperature for about 15 min. then raised to boiling, boiled for about 5 min and cooled to ambient temperature.
