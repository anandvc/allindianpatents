Title: Sldn-protecting.alkalinitv-controlliiig composition and the use thereof-Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a skin-protecting alkalinity-controlling composition as well as the use of a composition comprising at least one carboxylic acid polysac-charide for skin protection and/or alkalinity control.<br>
Background Art<br>
Pectin is a complex polysaccharide associated with plant cell walls. It consists of an alpha 1-4 linked polygalacturonic acid backbone intervened by rhamnose residues and modified with neutral sugar side chains and non-sugar components such as ace-tyl, methyl, and ferulic acid groups.<br>
The neutral sugar side chains, which include arabman and arabinogalactans, are attached to the rhamnose residues in the backbone. The rhamnose residues tend to cluster together on the backbone. So, with the side chains attached, this region is referred to as the hairy region and the rest of the backbone is hence named the smooth region.<br>
In US 5,929,051, Ni, et al. pectin is described as a plant cell wall component. The cell wall is divided into three layers, middle lamella, primary, and secondary cell wall. The middle lamella is the richest in pectin. Pectins are produced and deposited<br>
during cell wall growth. Pectins are particularly abundant in soft plant tissues under<br><br>
conditions of fast growth and high moisture content. In cell walls, pectins are present in the form of a calcium complex. The involvement of calcium cross-linking is substantiated by the fact that chelating agents facilitate the release of pectin from cell walls as disclosed by Nanji (US 1,634,879) and Maclay (US 2,375,376).<br><br>
WO 2005/102262	PCT/DK2005/000285<br>
2<br>
According to Dumitriu, S.: Polysaccharides, Structural diversity and functional ver-satility, Marcel Delcker, Inc., New York, 1998, 416 - 419, pectin is used in a range of food products.<br>
Historically, pectin has mainly been used as a gelling agent for jam or similar, fruit-containing, or fruit-flavoured, sugar-rich systems. Examples are traditional jams, jams with reduced sugar content, clear jellies, fruit-flavoured confectionery gels, non-fruit-flavoured confectionery gels, heat-reversible glazing for the bakery industry, heat-resistant jams for the bakery industry, ripples for use in ice cream, and fruit preparations for yoghurt.<br>
A substantial portion of pectin is used today for stabilization of low-pH milk drinks, including fermented drinks and mixtures of fruit juice and milk.<br>
The galacturonic acid residues in pectin are partly esterified and present as the<br>
it<br>
methyl ester. The degree of esterification is defined as the percentage of carboxyl groups esterified. Pectin with a degree of esterification ("DE") above 50% is named high methyl ester ("HM") pectin or high ester pectin and one with a DE lower than 50% is referred to as low methyl ester ("LM") pectin or low ester pectin. Most pectins found in plant material such as fruits, vegetables and eelgrass are HM pectins.<br>
Pectins are soluble in water and insoluble in most organic solvents. Pectins with a very low level of methyl-esterification and pectic acids are for practical purposes only soluble as the potassium or sodium salts.<br>
Pectins are most stable at pH 3-4. Below pH 3, methoxyl and acetyl groups and neutral sugar side chains are removed. At elevated temperatures, these reactions are accelerated and cleavage of glycosidic bonds in the galacturonan backbone occurs. Under neutral and alkaline conditions, methyl ester groups are saponified and the polygalacturonan backbone breaks through beta-elimination-cleavage of glycosidic<br><br>
WO 2005/102262	PCT/DK2005/000285<br>
3<br>
bonds at the non-reducing ends of methoxylated galacturonic acid residues. These reactions also proceed faster with increasing temperature. Pectic acids and LM pectins are resistant to neutral and alkaline conditions since there are no or only limited numbers of methyl ester groups.<br>
Pectin is a weak acid, and is less soluble at low pH than at high pH. Thus, by changing the pH of the pectin during manufacture thereof, a pectin having lower or higher solubility is provided: The pH is typically increased through the use of bases such as alkali metal hydroxides or alkali metal carbonates, but other bases are equally use-able. For instance, by using sodium carbonate, sodium pectinate is formed and the higher the dosage of sodium carbonate and, thus, the higher the pH, the more of the carboxylic acids are transformed to their sodium salts.<br>
However, at higher pH the pectin starts to de-esterify during pH-adjustment, handling and storage. Thus the pH should be maintained at a level at or below pH 6.<br>
In some cases, pectin as manufactured is esterified in a block-wise fashion. WO 2004020472 describes this phenomenon as the block-wise de-esterification takes place in the raw material used for making pectin, and the disclosure relates to a method for eliminating this block-wise de-esterification.<br>
WO 8912648 discloses a method for transforming block-wise de-esterified pectin into pectin with a random distribution of ester groups. The method involves the use of polygalacturonase, which splits the pectin molecule in those areas of the pectin molecule that are non-esterified. Thus, this method provides a lower molecular weight pectin having a higher degree of esterification than the block-wise esterified starting pectin.<br>
According to Kertesz, Z. I: The Pectic Substances, Interscience Publishers, Ihc, New York, 1951, pectic materials occur in all plant tissues. However, apples, beets, flax,<br><br>
WO 2005/102262	PCT/DK2005/000285<br>
4<br>
grapefruit, lemons, limes, oranges, potatoes, and sunflower are of particular industrial importance. Lately, also the pectin in Aloe Vera has shown industrial utility.<br>
Pectin according to the present invention needs not be extracted from the pectin containing starting material. Such crude pectin preparations are disclosed in US 2,132,065, US 3,982,003, US 4,831,127, WO 9115517, US 5,354,851, US 5,403,612, US 5,567,ft62, US 5,656,734, and WO 9749734.<br>
Other esteriiied carboxy acid polymers include, but are not limited to<br>
Pectin ethyl ester, made using ethyl iodide and heating as disclosed by Kertesz, Z.I.: The Pectic Substances, Interscience Publishers, Inc., New York, 251, 1951. In addition, pectic acid and pectinic acid may be totally or partially es-<br>
terified with aliphatic, arylaliphatic, cycloaliphatic or heterocychc alcohols.<br>
i<br>
When the acid is only partially esterified, the remaining free carboxyl groups may be salified with inorganic or organic bases. The esters may be used in the pharmaceutical, biomedical, alimentary and cosmetic fields. The esters may be prepared from a quaternary ammonium salt of pectic acid or pectinic acid and an esterifying agent such as a halogenide as disclosed in US 5,384,400.<br>
Esterified polysaccharide manufactured with a ketene dimer using an enzyme as a catalyst under mild reaction conditions as disclosed in US 6,624,298, The polysaccharide used is at least one selected from the group consisting of cellulose ethers, hydroxyethylcelhuose, hydroxypropylcellulose, carboxymethyl-cellulose, guar, cationic guar, and hydroxypropylguar.<br>
Starch esters. Methods for the preparation of starch esters are described in the<br>
li<br>
article by Tessler, M. M. and Bilimers, R. L., Preparation of Starch Esters, in Journal of Environmental Polymer Degradation 4 (1996) 85-89 and further disclosed in US 6,605,715.<br><br>
WO 2005/102262	PCT/DK2005/000285<br>
5 Polymerized sugar esters as described in US 5,859,217.<br>
Esters of alginic acid. Examples include ethylene glycol and propylene glycol esters, methyl ester, homologues of methyl ester, and esters of aromatic, ar-aliphatic, alicyclic and heterocyclic alcohols. Also included are esters deriving from substituted alcohols such as esters of bivalent aliphatic alcohols as disclosed in US 5,416,205.<br>
According to www.smartskincare.com, sweat is a salty, watery solution produced by<br>
sweat glands, numerous microscopic channels opening onto the skin surface. As se-<br>
ii<br>
bum and sweat mix up on the skin surface, they form a protective layer often referred to as the acid mantle. The skin is mildly acidic. In addition to helping protect skin from "the elements" (such as wind or pollutants), the acid mantle also inhibits the growth of harmful bacteria and fungi. If the acid mantle is disrupted or loses its acidity, the sldn becomes more prone to damage and infection. The loss of acid mantle is one of the side effects of washing the skin with soaps or detergents of moderate or high strength.<br>
i<br>
According to US 5,837,254, fungal infections of the vagina or urinary tract are difficult to eradicate and frequently recur but are rarely life threatening. The normal pH of the genital tract is 4.5 to 5, which is maintained by lactobacillus. The absence of lactobacillus and a normal pH promotes candidiasis as well as the herpes virus, birth control pills, a weak immune system, genetic factors, stress and a host of other factors, which foster the growth of yeast and fungal infections of the genital tract. Candida albicans grows readily in a moist environment at a pH of more than 5.<br>
In US 5,972,321 it is stated that aalthough body odor may be partially due to certain chemicals secreted by sebaceous glands and eccrine sweat glands, major axillary (underarm) foul odor is due to secretions of the apocrine glands, which contain special nutrient materials for microorganisms. The apocrine glands secrete a milky fluid that has a pH range of 5 to 6.5 and initially consists of lipids, proteins and carbohy-<br><br>
WO 2005/102262	PCT/DK2005/000285<br>
6<br>
drates. Although gram-positive bacteria, which thrive on substances found on the moist skin surface, appear to be responsible for the production of malodor, the precise mechanisms of odor production are still unclear.<br>
According to US 4,666,707, bath salt compositions are prepared by incorporating perfume, colorant, plant extract, organic acid and so on into an inorganic salt mixture comprising sodium sulfate, borax, sulfur, sodium chloride, carbonate salt, etc., and are used for ther purpose of providing the bath with perfume and/or color, or adequately stimulating the skin to thereby promote the blood circulation, the recovery from fatigue and/or the metabolism. Among such bath salt compositions, there are foaming bath salt compositions comprising a combination of a carbonate salt and<br>
an acid, which produces, in the bath, carbon dioxide gas bubbles to thereby cause a<br>
ii<br>
relaxing or refreshing sensation and render bathing enjoyable.<br>
According to US 6,589,923 and US 4,335,025, upon washing with soap, a pH of 8-10 is established in the wash liquor. This alkalinity neutralizes the natural acid mantle of the skin (pH 5-6). Although in normal skin this acid mantle is reformed relatively quickly, in sensitive or pre-damaged skin irritations may result. A further disadvantage of soaps is the formation of insoluble lime soaps in hard water. Being alkaline, soap emulsifies the oily layer covering the natural horny layer (stratum corneum) of a person's skin and neutralizes a likewise natural acid mantle of the epidermis, which has, 'normally, an acid pH of approximately 5.5-6.5. Failure to readily regenerate the acid and oily part of the epidermis—particularly among older people-often results in dermatological symptoms, such as itching, chapping and cracking of the epidermis, especially in cold weather. Of course, always to be considered is that<br>
significant segment of the population, which is allergic to or cannot tolerate conven-<br>
i tional soaps in view of a number of reactions (sensitivities) resulting from the use<br>
thereof.<br>
According to US ,6,551,987, US 6,013,618 and US 5,626,852, pro-fragrances are compounds, which under certain conditions break down to fragrances. For instance,<br><br>
WO 2005/102262	PCT/DK2005/000285<br>
7<br>
tris(9-decenyl) when exposed to suitable conditions (e.g., exposure to the acid mantle of human skin) breaks down to release a mixture of 9-decenol and 9-decenyl formate, both of whicn are fragrance raw materials.<br>
In US 6,352,700 it is stated that while products exist that are said to address the problems of skin irritation and inflamation, they inevitably fail to address the short-term impact of various additives on the pH balance of the skin, i.e., the skin's acid mantle. To put this into perspective, one need only to consider conventional facial tissue, toilet tissue, napkin and paper towel products that are used for wiping dry or wet skin. Upon contact with skin, the tissue products transfer some of the chemicals present in the tissue to the skin surface.<br>
According to US 6,150,405 and US 5,667,769, some hair care preparations particularly for treating hair loss, contain hydroxyl scavengers.<br>
According to US 4,761,279, the application of a conventional shaving preparation of high alkalinity is often irritating to the skin.<br>
US 2,253,389 discloses the use of alkali to make pectin, which does not require sugar and acid to form gels. A gel is formed by soluble pectin in a neutral or slightly alkaline aqueous medium in the presence of a metal compound, and it is stressed that the alkalinity must be insufficient to convert pectin to pectate. The resulting gelling agent is particularly useful for substituting gelatine in jellies of water and milk.<br>
GB 541,528 discloses the importance of applying low temperature for demethoxy-lating pectin. By controlling alkali hydrolysis of pectin at temperatures between 10C and the freezing point of the pectin solution, low ester pectin of high setting power and with a low setting temperature can be made. Hydrolysis is performed in an aqueous medium and the hydrolysis is terminated by neutralization. It is disclosed that the hydrolysis is very rapid at pH 12 and very slow at pH 8.5.<br><br>
WO 2005/102262	PCT/DK2005/000285<br>
8<br>
US 2,478,170 discloses pectin with 20-30% remaining acid groups, which gel by the addition of calcium ions, with or without sugar. Alkalis are alkali metal hydroxides, ammonium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, organic ammonium bases etc. and the process involves an aqueous solution or extract of pectin being adjusted to temperatures below 35°C and pH 10-12. When the desired methoxyl content is reached, pH is reduced to 4, and the pectinic acid is isolated.<br>
In "The Pectic Substances", Interscience Publishers, Inc., New York, 1951, Kertesz describes the effect of bases on pectin. When alkali is added to a pectin solution to<br>
an extent, which is higher than the amount needed for neutralizing the pectin, deli<br>
methoxylation commences. This process consumes the alkali and the pH of the solution soon drops. Kertesz also refers to other findings, which suggest that the consumption of alkali increases as a result of the alkali concentration, or the duration of<br>
i<br>
treatment with alkali, or as the temperature of the reaction is raised. Thus, he suggests that this alkali consumption may be utilized for determining the ester content of pectinic acids.<br>
JP 2001226220 discloses the use of alcohol extracted Citrus junos seed pectin to make a skin lotion composed of said pectin, deep sea layer water and sea water or water. The lotion is characterized by being non-sticky, non-irritant and by having a low pH. Conventionally, pectin is extracted in water, whereas alcohol is known to<br>
'I-<br>
make pectin insoluble. In addition, the disclosure does not discuss the composition of the pectin.<br>
WO 02/14374 discloses the use of hydrocolloids as thickening or emulsifying agents for a variety of products, such as foodstuffs, pharmaceutical compositions, personal care products and beverages.<br>
WO 04/005352 discloses the use of amidated pectins, such as in cremes, lotions and household products.<br><br>
WO 2005/102262	PCT/DK2005/00028S<br>
9<br>
US 6,509,311 discloses a gel system comprising propylene glycol alginate as a gelling agent, as a water binder, as an emulsifier and as a stabiliser.<br>
A need for a composition remains, which is capable of providing buffering, thus avoiding a major increase in the pH of an aqueous system and/or useable for reduc-ing the pH of aqueous systems, in which alkalinity is formed as a result of chemical and/or biological reactions, or as a result of alkalinity being imposed on the aqueous system by the environment. In particular, there is a need for a composition, which will protect the acid mantle, and there is a need for incorporating such a composition in articles, which are in contact with the skin, either human skin or animal skin.<br>

13 Best Modes for Carrying out the Invention<br>
The skin-protecting alkalinity-controlling composition according to the invention comprises one or more high DE carboxylic acid polysaccharides selected from the group comprising pectin esters, esterified cellulose ethers, esterified hydroxyethyl-cellulose, esterified carboxymethylcellulose, esterified guar gum, esterified cationic guar gum, esterified hydroxypropyl guar gum, starch esters, and polymerized sugar , esters.<br>
A high DE carboxylic' acid polysaccharide provides for a rapid pH-drop due to the low amount of free carboxylic acid groups present. Thus, if a rapid pH-drop is needed, a high DE carboxylic acid polysaccharide should be used. This fact can be utilized in a range of products intended to be applied to the skin of humans or animals. Uses include but are not limited to lotions, creams, foundations, face masks, hair care products, genital lotions, deodorants, ostomy products, feminine hygiene products, laundry products, bath salt products, soap products, fragrance products, lo-tionized tissue products, and shaving products. Further, such pectin can be used in similar products to treat animals.<br>
In a preferred embodiment according to the invention, said high DE carboxylic acid polysacchande is a pectin ester, preferably a pectin ester of aliphatic, arylaliphatic, cycloaliphatic or heterdcyclic alcohols, more preferably an ester of methanol, etha-nol, propanol or isopropanol, and most preferably an ester of methanol.<br>
The advantage of using methanol esters of pectin is the natural occurrence of such<br>
ester. However, without being bound by theory, methyl esters of pectin are more<br>
ii prone to liberate the alcohol part thereof during de-estenfication. Esters of pectin<br>
with higher alcohols are not as prone to alkaline de-esterification.<br>
In a still more preferred embodiment of the invention, said pectin is of a molecular weight in the range from about 5,000 to about 140,000, preferably in the range from<br><br>
WO 2005/102262	PCT/DK2005/000285<br>
14<br>
about 10,000 to about 125,000, most preferably in the range from about 10,000 to about 40,000.<br>
As demonstrated in example 1 below, the molecular weight of pectin has no influence on the alkah consumption or on the pH drop encountered. However, by adjusting the molecular weight of the pectin it is possible to adjust the amount of pectin, which may be dissolved or suspended in a final product. Thus, as disclosed in more detail in example 11, a lower molecular weight pectin is easier to dissolve and the viscosity of the resulting pectin-containing solution is lower than hi a corresponding higher molecular weight-containing pectin. This fact can be utilized to obtain a relatively highly concentrated pectin-solution'having suitably low viscosity, e.g. for use in fabric-treating products. The pectin having a molecular weight below about 40,000 can be made at concentrations above about 10% without causing unacceptable high viscosity. Such pectin could be manufactured and marketed as a concentrated solution with a pectin concentration in excess of 10%. Alternatively, the possibility of making such pectin solution in concentrations above about 10% makes spray-drying of such solutions economically feasible.<br>
The degree of esterification indicates the average DE of any given polysaccharide. By controlling the distribution of ester groups along the polysaccharide chain to obtain either a random or a block-wise distribution of ester groups, it is possible to obtain a locally higher or lower DE polysaccharide. As demonstrated in example 3, the alkali consumption of a pectin having a block-wise ester group distribution is the same as the alkali consumption of a corresponding pectin having a random ester group distribution. However, the pH-drop of the two pectins is considerably larger for the block-wise esterified pectin, presumably because such pectm will act as a pectin with a higher average DE. Thus, by treating a block-wise esterified pectin with a polygalacturarase, which splits the pectin at non-esterified sites, a lower molecular weight pectin may be obtained having an increased DE.<br><br>

A carboxylic acid polysaccharide having a relatively low DE provides for a large al-kali consumptionscapacity or buffer capacity.<br>
An advantage of a higher buffer capacity is the ability of the pectin to neutralize an initial high concentration of alkali. This is an advantage particularly when fabrics are insufficiently depleted for alkaline washing powder. Thus, by combining a low DE and a high DE carboxylic acid polysaccharide, an initial alkali consumption buffering can be obtained succeeded by a pH-reduction.<br>

32 Examples<br>
The following examples are non-limiting. Example 1: Effect of molecular weight<br>
Five samples of different molecular weight, but with similar DE made from dried lemon peel were titrated and the pH drop over time recorded for samples dissolved at 70°C and 20°C, respectively. The pH drop was measured at 30 - 32°C. Titration was done using 0.1008M NaOH, The comment "unstable" refers to the pH-meter, which at high pH values showed an unstable reading.<br>
1. 97CP001-39-0: Mw=123.000; DE=71.4%<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Fig. 1.1 shows that thfe molecular weight of pectin has no influence on the alkali consumption.<br>
The data in fig. 1.2 do [not suggest a change in the pH-drop resulting from a change in molecular weight. In practice, this means that a pH controlling preparation made<br>
from pectin can be made thick (high molecular weight) or thin (low molecular<br>
!li weight) or basically with any viscosity between the two extremes. In addition, if the<br>
111 alkali consumption is to be increased, a low molecular weight pectin preparation<br>
makes it possible to increase the concentration of pectin without making the alkali consuming preparationttoo viscous.<br>
Fig. 1.3 shows that dissolution temperature does not change the drop in pH. Thus,<br>
II irrespective of the molecular weight, pectin preparation for controlling pH can be<br>
III made either hot or cold:<br>
Example 2: Effect of Degree of Esterification<br>
Eight samples were prepared with different degree of esterification ranging from about 9 to 93%. The samples were made from dried lemon peel. All were titrated and the pH drop over time recorded for samples dissolved at 70°C and 20°C, respectively. The pH drop was measured at 30 - 32°C. Titration was done using 0.1008 M<br>
ill NaOH. The comment {'unstable" refers to the pH-meter, which at high pH values<br>
showed an unstable reading.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Fig 2.1 shows that one pectin is characterized by a higher starting pH than the rest. Conventionally, pectin is neutralized with an alkali metal base to a pH in the range 3 — 4 or even higher. This is mainly in order to preserve the pectin, but it also has an impact on the solubility of the pectin. However, if one moves the curve for DE-9.6% upwards to connect with the other curves, the picture becomes clear: With increasing DE and consequently decreasing galacturonic acid, the pectin can consume less alkali. Thus, if pectin is used to neutralize alkali, the degree of esterifica-tion and the starting pH should be as low as possible.<br>
To further elaborate on this point, I define buffer capacity as ml. 0.1 M NaOH required to increase the pH by 1 pH unit, calculated from the part of the titration curve, which is steepest.<br>
Thus, the approximate buffer capacities as calculated from fig. 2.1 are:<br>
DE=9.6% and DE=34.4%: Buffer capacity about 26 DE=71%: Buffer capacity about 12 DE=93.4%: Buffer capacity less than 6<br><br>
43<br>
Fig. 2.2 show a dramatic increase hi the pH-drop as the degree of esterification is increased.<br>
Fig. 2.3 shows the same dramatic influence of DE even when the pectin is dissolved at 20°C. The figure shows that at the high DE, the pH is eventually decreased below 5.5.<br>
These results are compiled in fig. 2.4, in which the pH drop has been followed for the first up to about 130 minutes. It is evident that the pH-drop occurs to the same extent whether the pectin solution is made hot or cold.<br>
For DE=93.4%, time to reach pH=8 is 2 minutes, for DE=71% it takes 12 minutes, for DE=34.4% the time is 35 minutes and for DE=9.6% it takes 130 minutes. In order to reach pH=7, the difference is even bigger. Pectin with a DE=71 is about 9 times slower than pectin with DE==93.4, and pectin with DE lower than 71% are slower than a factor 10 compared to pectin with DE-93.4.<br>
Thus, if one needs to obtain a rapid pH decrease as a result of alkali generation, pectin with as high a DE as possible is preferred. If, on the other hand, the need calls for slower reduction of pH, then a lower DE would be preferred. Selecting pectin of a specific DE makes it possible to reduce the pH at a specific rate.<br>
Another aspect is to combine pectin preparations of different DE. For example, one migjit combine a low DE pectin and a high DE pectin to achieve initial alkali consumption or buffer capacity and to provide pH reduction, when the buffer capacity is used.<br>
Example 3: Effect of Methyl Ester Distribution<br>
Two samples were made from dried lemon peel. One was de-esterified with a bacterial pectin esterase, which results in a random distribution of the methyl ester<br><br>
WO 2005/102262	PCT/DK2005/000285<br>
44<br>
groups. The other was de-esterified with a plant pectin esterase, which results in a block wise distribution of the methyl ester groups. The samples were made to similar DE. Both samples were titrated and the pH drop over time recorded for samples dissolved at 70°C and 20°C, respectively. The pH drop was measured at 30 - 32°C. Titration was done using 0.1008 M NaOH. The comment "unstable" refers to the pH-meter, which at high pH values showed an unstable reading.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Fig. 3.1 shows that the distribution of methyl esters in pectin has no impact on the alkali consumption. The galacturonic acid drives the alkali consumption.<br>
Fig. 3.2 indicates a difference in the rate of the pH-drop. It also shows, that identical pH-drop is achieved whether the pectin has been dissolved hot or cold.<br>
Fig. 3.3 shows the pH-drop in the first 120 - 130 minutes, and a random ester group distribution needs about 4 times longer to reach pH=8 compared to a blocky ester group distribution. Since the two pectin preparations have almost identical average DE, the faster pH-drop of a blocky ester distribution is explained by local concentration of ester groups. Thus, pectin with a blocky ester distribution will act as pectin with a higher average DE. In practice, this is important because one might treat a blocky pectin with polygalacturonase to increase the DE, which would constitute an easier way to make a high ester pectin than by using the process of re-methylation.<br><br>
47 Example 4: Effect of temperature<br>
The pH drop for one sample having DE=71% and made from dried lemon peel was recorded at four different temperatures. The sample was prepared by dissolving the pectin at 70°C and subsequently cooling the solution to the recording temperature. The temperature was maintained with a thermostatically controlled water bath.<br><br><br><br>
Fig. 4.1 shows that the rate of the pH-drop increases with increasing temperature. The rate is particularly increased as the temperature increases above about 30°C.<br>
Example 5: Effect of multiple additions of alkali<br>
The pH drop for one sample having DB=71% and made from dried lemon peel was recorded at a temperature of 25 - 27°C. First, the pH was raised to about 10 with 19 ml. 0.1 M NaOH. When the sample had reached a pH of 6 - 7, the pH was again raised to about 10. This required 1.1 ml. 0.1 M NaOH. When the pH had reached 6 -7, the pH was raised a third time to about 10, which required 1.2 ml. 0.1 M NaOH. The sample was prepared by dissolving the pectin at 70°C and subsequently cooling the solution to the recording temperature. The temperature was maintained with a thermostatically controlled water bath.<br>
1. SampleiwithDE=71%<br><br><br><br>
Fig. 5.1 shows that the rate of the pH-drop stays unchanged after at least three cycles, where the pH is first increased to about 10, then after the pH has dropped increased to about 10. After one cycle, the DE is decreased to about 66%, so the ability to continue reducing pH is caused by an incomplete de-esterification.<br>
Thus, if alkalinity is appears in pulses, for at least three times pectin is able to reduce the alkali. In fact, in one experiment, which went on for seven days, a 200 ml. 1% pectin solution of DE=71% consumed 73 ml. of a 0.1 MNaOH solution. After this period, the DE has .decreased to 9.1%.<br>
Thus, 2 g. pectin consumes 7.3 mmol NaOH, which corresponds to about 0.3 g.<br>
HI<br>
NaOH. It also means that about 0.23 g. methanol is produced, which in combination with the acid effect of pectin may explain the anti-microbial effect of pectin.<br><br>

50 Example 6: Effect of pectin concentration<br>
The pH drop for one sample having DE=81.7% and made from dried lemon peel was recorded at a temperature of 30 - 32°C. The concentration of pectin was 0.05 -5 2%. The sample was prepared by dissolving the pectin at 70°C and subsequently cooling the solution to the recording temperature. The temperature was maintained with a thermostatically .pontrolled water bath.<br>
1. Sample with|DE=81.7% 10<br><br>
Fig. 6.1 shows that at pectin concentrations above 1%, the pH-drop appears to be in-Ill dependent of the pectin concentration. However, even at very low concentrations of<br>
5 pectin, a clear drop in pH occurs.<br><br>

Example 7: pH drop of water<br>
Carbon dioxide is soluble in water, and this experiment shows the pH drop of ion-5 exchanged water over time without the presence of pectin or other additions. The temperature of the water was kept at 25°C using a thermostatically controlled water bath.<br>

4. Effect of multiple additions of alkali<br>
The pH drop for one sample, Manucol Ester ER/K, was recorded at a<br>
!i<br>
temperature of 30 - 32°C. First, the pH was raised to about 10 with 4 ml.<br>
.i 0.1 M NaOH. When the sample had reached a pH of 5 - 6, the pH was<br>
again raised^to about 10. This required 2.5 ml. 0.1 M NaOH. When the pH had reached 5-6, the pH was raised a third time to about 10, which<br>
required 2.0 ml. 0.1 M NaOH. When the pH had reached about 6, the pH<br>
!<br>
was again increased to about 10, which required 1.5 ml. NaOH. The sample was prepared by dissolving the pectin at 70°C and subsequently cooling the solution to the recording temperature. The temperature was maintained with a thermostatically controlled water bath.<br><br><br>

Table 8 4. Multiple pH drop of high DE PGA<br>
Fig. 8.1 shows that as the degree of esterifiaction increases in PGA, the less alkali can be consumed.<br>
Buffer capacities are calculated to<br>
PGA with DE about 85%: About 4.1 PGA with DE about 80%: About 5.7 PGA with DE about 55%: About 8.1<br>
Thus, PGA provides less buffering effect compared to pectin.<br>
Fig. 8.2 shows that as for pectin, PGA provides a faster pH drop with increasing degree of esterification.<br>
Fig. 8.3 shows the same dramatic influence of esterification even when the propyl-ene glycol alginate is dissolved at 20°C. The figure shows that at the high DE, the pH is eventually decreased to below 5.<br>
Fig. 8.4 shows that the pH-drop occurs to the same extent whether the propylene glycol alginate solution is made hot or cold.<br><br>

Example 9: Effect of multiple additions of alkali to propvlens jglvcol alginate<br>
The pH drop for one sample, Manucol Ester ER/K, was recorded at a temperature of 30 - 32°C. First, the pH was raised to about 10 with 4 ml. 0.1 M NaOH. When the sample had reached a pH of 5 - 6, the pH was again raised to about 10. This re-quired 2.5 ml. 0.1 M NaOH. When the pH had reached 5-6, the pH was raised a third time to about 10, which required 2.0 ml. 0.1 M NaOH. When the pH had reached about "6, the pH was again increased to about 10, which required 1.5 ml. NaOH. The sample was prepared by dissolving the pectin at 70°C and subsequently cooling the solution to;the recording temperature. The temperature was maintained with a thermostatically controlled water bath.<br><br>

WO 20Q5/102262	PCT/DK2005/000285<br>

Example 10: pH-drop in lotion<br>
The pH drop in lotions made according to the two methods described in "Materials and Methods" section £.1 were measured using pectin of about DEH31.7%.<br>
10	grams lotion was slurried in 50 ml distilled water and pH was adjusted with 0.1<br>
M NaOH to about 10. Pectin concentration in slurry: 0.125%. Temperature: 30°C.<br><br>
It may seem that when pectin is dissolved in the water phase before mixing with the<br>
011	phase provides for a more rapid pH-drop. However, when taking into considera-<br>
iji tion, that the curve for pecto dissolved in .file water phase starts at a slightly lower<br>
pH, the two curves are close to identical- Thus, there is nothing to suggest that one of the methods for making the lotion influences the effect of the pectin.<br><br>

A rinse is normally performed using 16 liters of water. Assuming that the rinse dos-age is 100 ml, then 0.01% pectin in the rinse corresponds to a pectin solution of 1.57%. 0.05% pectin in the rinse corresponds to a pectin solution of 7.4%. 0.10% pectin in the rinse corresponds to a pectin solution of 13.79%. 0.20% pectin in the rinse corresponds to a pectin solution of 26.41% and 0.05% pectin in the rinse corresponds to a pectin solution of 44.44%.<br>

It is clear that as the molecular weights drops, it becomes easier to dissolve the pectin, and in addition the viscosity becomes lower. This enables a rinse to contain more pectin in lower rinse dosage.<br>

maximum concentration of pectin in the rinse is about 3%, for a pectin with molecular weight of 41,500, the maximum concentration of pectin in the rinse is about 10% and for a pectin with molecular weight of 25,000, the maximum concentration of pectin in the rinse is about 12%.<br>
